 Terry , I know I haven 't worked here Iong . . . . . . but I was wondering , would it be possible . . . . . . if I got a $ 1 00 advance on my salary ?

 An advance ?
 So that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family .
 Every year we ski in Vail , and my father pays for my ticket . . . . . . but I 've started this whole independent thing . . . . . . which is actuaIly why I took this " job . "

 Rachel , Rachel , sweetheart !
 You 're a terrible , terrible waitress .
 ReaIly , reaIly awful .
 I hear what you 're saying . I 'm with you .
 But I 'm trying reaIly hard , and I think I 'm doing better .
 I reaIly do .
 Does anybody need coffee ?

 You 're wrong . I am not wrong .
 You 're wrong .
 No , I just talked to them . I 'm caIling Mom .


 And this from the Cry for Help Department : Are you wearing makeup ? Yes , I am .
 As of today , I 'm officiaIly " Joey Tribbiani : actor/ model . "

 The asthma guy 's reaIly cute .

 But I hear Lyme disease is open , so . . . .
 Good Iuck , man . I hope you get it .
 Thanks .
 You were right . How can they do this to us ? It 's Thanksgiving !
 How about if I cook dinner at my place ?
 I 'II make it just Iike Mom 's .
 WiII you make the mashed potatoes with the Iumps ?
 They 're not actuaIly supposed to --
 I 'II work on the Iumps .
 Joey , you 're going home , right ?
 Chandler , you 're stiII boycotting aII the pilgrim holidays ? Yes .
 Every single one of them .

 But we 're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he 's Iunar . So you 're free Thursday , then ?

 Yeah . Oh , can I come ?
 Rach , you stiII going to Vail ?
 Absolutely . Shoop , shoop , shoop !
 Only $ 1 02 to go .
 I thought it was 98 . 50 ?
 WeIl , it was , but I broke a cup .
 WeIl , I 'm off to Carol 's .
 Ooh , ooh , why don 't we invite her ?
 Ooh , ooh , because she 's my ex- wife . . . . . . and wiII probably want to bring her ooh , ooh , Iesbian Iife- partner .
 Is CaroI here ?
 No , she 's at a faculty meeting .
 I just came by to pick up my skuIl .
 WeIl , not mine , but . . . .
 Come in .
 CaroI borrowed it for a class , and I have to get it back to the museum .
 What 's it Iook Iike ?
 Kind of Iike a big face without skin .
 I 'm familiar with the concept . You can just Iook for it .
 You guys sure have a Iot of books about being a Iesbian .
 You know , you have to take a course .
 Otherwise they don 't Iet you do it . Yertle the Turtle !
 A classic .
 ActuaIly , I 'm reading it to the baby .
 The baby that hasn 't been born yet ?
 Wouldn 't that mean you 're . . . . . . crazy ? What ?
 You don 't think they can hear sounds in there ?
 You 're not serious ?
 I mean . . . . . . you reaIly talk to it ?
 Yeah , aII the time . I want the baby to know my voice .
 Do you talk about me ?
 AII the time .
 ReaIly ?
 We just refer to you as " Bobo , the sperm guy . "
 If she 's talking to it , I just think I should get some beIly- time too .
 Not that I believe any of this .
 I believe it . I think the baby can totaIly hear everything .

 I 'II show you . This wiII seem a Iittle weird . But you put your head inside this turkey . . . . . . and we 'II aII talk and you 'II hear everything we say .
 I 'd just Iike to say I 'm totaIly behind this experiment .
 In fact , I 'd very much Iike to butter your head . - Did you make your money ?


 - Not even close .
 Forget Vail .
 Forget seeing my family . Forget shoop , shoop , shoop .
 Here 's your mail .
 Thanks . You can just put it on the table .
 Here 's your mail !

 Would you just open it !
 Oh , my God ! You guys are great !
 We aII chipped in .

 You owe me $20 .
 Thank you . Thank you so much !
 Chandler , here you go .
 Your traditionaI holiday feast .
 Tomato soup . . . . . . griIled- cheese fixings and your family- size bag of Funyuns .
 This is your Thanksgiving dinner ?
 What is it with you and this holiday ?
 I 'm 9 years old . I hate this story !
 We 've just finished Thanksgiving dinner .
 I have -- I remember this part vividly -- -- a mouthfuI of pumpkin pie .

 And this is the moment my parents teII me they 're getting divorced .
 Oh , my God !
 Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you 've seen it in reverse .

 We used to work together .
 We did ? At Macy 's . You 're the Obsession girl , right ?
 I was the Aramis guy . Aramis ? Aramis ?
 Yeah , right !
 You 're the best in the business . - Get out !
 - I 'm serious ! You 're amazing ! You know when to spritz .
 You know when to Iay back .
 ReaIly ? You don 't know what that means to me .
 You smeII great tonight .
 What are you wearing ?
 Nothing . Listen , do you wanna go get a drink ?
 Yeah , that would be --
 - What 's wrong ? - I remembered I have to do something .
 What ?
 Leave .
 Wait , wait , wait !

 I guess you aII saw it . Saw what ?
 We 're just Iaughing .
 You know how Iaughter can be infectious .
 Set another place for Thanksgiving . My entire family thinks I have VD .
 " Tonight , on a very speciaI Blossom . "
 Looking good ! Okay ! Cider 's muIling , turkey 's turking , yams are yamming . . . .
 What ?
 I don 't know . It 's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen .
 That 's it . Get out of my way and stop annoying me !
 WeIl , that 's closer . I got the tickets !
 Five hours from now , shoop , shoop , shoop ! Oh , you must stop shooping .
 I 'm gonna get my stuff .
 WiII you just come in , already ?
 I prefer to keep a safe distance from aII this merriment . Look out !
 Incoming pumpkin pie ! We aII Iaughed when you did it with the stuffing , but that 's not funny .

 Monica , I got a question . I don 't see any Tater Tots .
 That 's not a question .
 But my mom always makes them .
 It 's a tradition .
 A piece of turkey on your fork , a Iittle cranberry sauce and a Tot !
 I mean it 's . . . . . . bad enough I can 't be with my family , because of my disease .
 AII right . Fine . Tonight 's potatoes wiII be both mashed with Iumps . . . . . . and in the form of Tots .
 I 'm off to talk to my unborn child . Mom never hit .

 Okay , aII done .
 Phoebe , did you whip the pota -- ? Ross needs Iumps !
 Oh , I 'm sorry ! I just -- I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions .
 Why would we do that ?
 Then they 'd be Iike my mom used to make it . . . . . . before she died .
 Three kinds of potatoes coming up .
 Goodbye , you guys ! Thanks for everything !
 Oh , God , Iook at -- Sorry ! I 'm so sorry .
 The most unbelievable thing has happened ! Underdog has gotten away !
 The baIloon ?
 No , the actuaI cartoon character .
 Of course the baIloon !
 It 's aII over the news .
 He broke free and was spotted over Washington Square Park .
 I 'm going to the roof .
 Who 's with me ? I can 't . I gotta go !
 An 80- foot dog Ioose over the city ? How often does that happen ?
 Almost never .
 Got the keys ? Anytime you 're ready !

 Okay , here we go . Where am I talking to here ?

 There is one way that seems to offer a certain acousticaI advantage , but . . . .
 Just aim for the bump .
 Okay , here goes . You know , I can 't do this .
 It 's too weird . I feeI stupid . It 's fine .
 You don 't have to do it just because Susan does it .
 HeIlo , baby !
 -- the moment we first saw the giant dog shadow faII over the park !
 But did they have to shoot him down ? That was just mean .
 Right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside . . . . . . and juicy on the inside .
 Why are we standing here ?
 We 're waiting for you to open the door .
 You 've got the keys . No , I don 't .
 Yes , you do . When we Ieft , you said , " Got the keys . "
 No , I didn 't . I asked . . . . . . " Got the keys ? "
 You said , " Got the keys ! "
 Either of you have the keys ?
 The oven is on !
 I 've gotta get my ticket !
 Wait !
 We have a copy of your key . Then get it !
 That tone won 't make me go any faster .
 That one wiIl .
 And everyone 's teIling me , " You gotta pick a major ! "
 So on a dare , I picked paleontology .
 And you have no idea what I 'm saying , because , Iet 's face it , you 're a fetus .
 You 're just happy you don 't have giIls anymore .
 You don 't have to talk to it .
 You can sing to it . Please . I am not singing to your stomach .
 How 's it going ?
 Here we come Walking down the street Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet
 Hey , hey --
 - Did you feeI that ? - I did .
 - Does it always -- ? - That was the first !
 Keep singing ! Keep singing !
 Hey , hey , you 're my baby And I can 't wait to meet you When you come out I 'll buy you a bagel And then we 'll go to the zoo
 I felt it that time !
 Hey , hey , I 'm your daddy I 'm the one without any breasts
 Not that one .
 Can you go any faster ?
 I got one keyhole and a ziIlion keys ! You do the math .
 Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway ?
 For an emergency just Iike this . AII right .
 Listen , smirky !
 If it wasn 't for your stupid baIloon . . . . . . I 'd be on a plane watching a woman do this right now . But I 'm not ! I swear you said you had the keys !

 I wouldn 't say I had the keys unless I had the keys ! I obviously did not have the keys !
 That 's it ! Enough with the keys . No one say " keys " !
 Why would I have the keys !
 Besides the fact that you said you did ?
 - But I didn 't ! - WeIl , you should have .
 - Why ? - Because !
 Because everything 's my responsibility ? Isn 't it enough that I 'm making Thanksgiving dinner ?
 Everyone wants a different potato , so I 'm making different potatoes .
 Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want ?
 Just as Iong as Phoebe gets her peas and onions . . . . . . and Mario gets his Tots .
 It 's my first Thanksgiving , and I -- It 's aII burnt , and I can 't . . . . Monica , only dogs can hear you now .

 Look , the door 's open ! Here we go . The turkey 's burnt !
 Potatoes are ruined ! Potatoes are ruined ! Potatoes are ruined !
 Here we come Walking down the --
 This doesn 't smeII Iike Mom 's .
 It doesn 't , does it ?
 But you wanted Iumps . WeIl , here you go , buddy . You got one !
 God , this is great !
 The plane is gone , so I guess I 'm stuck here with you guys .
 We aII had better plans , okay ? This was nobody 's first choice ! Oh , reaIly ?
 So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner ?
 You caII that delicious ?

 Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it !
 Now , this feels Iike Thanksgiving .
 What ?
 Ugly Naked Guy 's taking his turkey out of the oven .
 Oh , my God ! He 's not alone .
 Ugly Naked Guy . . . . . . is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal .
 I gotta see this !
 AII right , Ugly Naked Guy !
 Ugly naked dancing !
 It 's nice that he has someone .
 ShaII I carve ? By aII means .
 Who wants Iight cheese , and who wants dark cheese ?
 I don 't even want to know about the dark cheese .
 - Does anybody want to split this ?
 - I wiIl .
 You guys have to make a wish .
 Make a wish ?
 Come on , you know , Thanksgiving . You got the bigger half !
 What did you wish for ?
 The bigger half .
 AII right , I 'd Iike to propose a toast . A Iittle toast here . Ding , ding !
 This isn 't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned . . . . . . but for me this has been reaIly great .
 I think because it didn 't involve divorce . . . . . . or projectile vomiting .

 If you had gone to Vail . . . . . . or if you had been with your family , or if you didn 't have . . . . . . syphilis and stuff . . .
 . . . we wouldn 't be aII together . So I guess what I 'm trying to say is . . . . . . I 'm very thankfuI that aII of your Thanksgivings sucked .
 - That 's so sweet ! - Thank you .
 Here 's to a Iousy Christmas ! And a crappy New Year !
