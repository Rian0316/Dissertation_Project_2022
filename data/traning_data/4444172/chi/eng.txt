 Here 's your menu .
 I 'll be right back with your water and a stomach pump .
 Keep it .
 I know what I want .
 Me too .
 But it just seems like
 Taylor Swift is never going away .
 You 're funny . Yeah .
 I 'm not in the mood for funny .
 I will take tomato soup , house salad , extra croutons .
 And you can charge me extra ... if you have no heart behind those gazongas .
 The guy at the counter has no teeth , so you can have his .
 It 's cool .
 Less funny ... more salad .
 Right ?
 Maybe the blonde one should bring it .
 Oh , you want her to bring it ?
 Maybe clear your calendar .
 Uh , the lady in the booth doesn 't like my attitude and wants you , so I guess what I 'm saying is
 I still got it !
 Wait , a customer asked for me and didn 't follow it with ,
 " I 'd also like to see the manager " ?
 That 's a first for me !
 Yo , Blondie !
 Croutons !
 [ ding ding ]
 Pick up .
 Tomato soup , house salad .
 And I 'm also running a special on D batteries .
 Buy both , and I 'll thrown in this bootleg copy of
 Here comes Horrible Bosses Too Small .
 Need some new batteries to keep walking and talking ?
 No , Max , I 'm not powered by double Ds like you .
 Preach .
 Don 't buy batteries from that guy unless you want your heart to stop on the bus .
 Oleg , this is supposed to have extra croutons .
 It 's for my regular .
 Yeah , you heard me .
 It happened .
 Oh , no , " Extra Croutons " is here again ?
 Make sure you charge her extra .
 I 'm not made of stale bread !
 No , you 're made of Legos , right ?
 We are not charging her extra .
 She looks like she can 't afford it .
 If she could , why would she be eating here ?
 Well , don 't judge a book by its cover .
 People look at me and ...
 Think you 're bad in bed ?
 What 's your point ?
 For your information , Max , I 'm not bad in bed .
 In fact , I 'm quite the stud in my Sims community .
 You wouldn 't be a stud in a retirement community .
 [ bell dings ]
 Hi !
 Here 's your salad ...
 Uh ... five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten .
 Uh , continue .
 And I wanted to introduce myself .
 I 'm Caroline , you 're regular waitress .
 Ah .
 Oh ! My turn .
 Sorry .
 I live alone , and my plants aren 't this needy .
 I 'm Nola .
 And this is Max .
 Max , this is Nola .
 ' Sup , Lola ?
 It 's Nola .
 See , this is why I like the blonde one .
 She listens .
 May I please have a cheesecake ?
 Sure .
 And thank you , Nola .
 I think it 's important to listen to people .
 Coming right back with that cherry pie .
 I 'll tell her if she ever stops listening .
 I think Nola knows I 'm more than just a waitress .
 She can see right through this uniform .
 And so can I ... in just the right light .
 - Close the door !
 - Oh , my God !
 Sophie , you scared me !
 You 're scared ?
 I just saw the expiration date on this milk !
 Come on , close it , quick !
 I 'm in here hiding from Oleg .
 If you wanna get away from Oleg , just go anywhere they sell floss .
 I think that Oleg is cheating on me .
 Look .

 Now she 's gonna start whipping it out ?
 Look ...
 He has a second secret phone .
 It 's a boner phone .
 You mean a burner phone .
 Same thing .
 Sophie , how do you know he just doesn 't use it for long distance or ...
 Or for the woman that I 'm calling right now ?
 Oh , put her on speaker .
 I 've nothing else to do .
 I 'm at work .


 [ grunts hoarsely ]
 Uh ... ah ...

 [ hoarsely ]
 Uhh ... ah !
 That ... is a terrible Oleg .
 He is not that articulate .
 [ woman speaking in Russian ]
 Hah !
 That old whore !
 What did she say ?
 I have no idea !
 I don 't speak Russian , but ...
 I do speak " old whore . "
 Tell me , what is his problem ?
 He has a sweet , young filly like me at home and he needs to go out and plow some old Russian field ?
 Well ...
 I 'd ask what you three are doing in here , but it 's never gonna top what I 'm imagining you 're doing in here .
 I can 't believe Nola didn 't come in tonight .
 This is exactly what happened with my Starbucks barista guy .
 One minute , he 's suggestively arranging the bananas at me , and then next minute , he 's face- down , dead in a puddle of soy milk .
 Max , what if something happened to her ?
 More croutons for us !
 She said , " I 'll see you tomorrow . "
 That doesn 't mean anything .
 It 's just an expression
 like , " Employees must wash hands . "
 Or ... or , " The baby is yours . "
 Hey , everybody !
 Oh , Sophie , it 's just you .
 You 're poor !
 And now we 're even .
 Look , I stole it again .
 Where 's Oleg ?
 I 'll tell you where he 's not ...
 Culinary school .
 He 's on break .
 Oh , she 's gonna be sorry !
 Oh ... no one comes between Sophie and her man .
 You know ... unless we pay them to .
 Couple things ...
 A ... does anyone ever work here ?
 Caroline , stop worrying .
 Extra Croutons is fine .
 She just called to order some diner food to be delivered .
 Oh !
 So she wants to die at home .
 I said we don 't do deliveries .
 I told her you two can barely get the food from the window to the tables !
 Max , I had to stop by and bring Nola her salad and croutons .
 I mean , she 's kind of my biggest fan right now .
 True ... ' cause you just lost me .
 I know you think this is crazy , but there 's something about the way Nola looks at me .
 It 's like she 's seeing something in me .
 The woman wears two pairs of glasses .
 To her , you 're just a chatty yellow and orange blur .
 I was told you didn 't deliver .
 By who , her old boyfriends ?
 Are you two gonna kill me or something ?
 Because if you are ,
 I would like to put on a different hat .
 No , no , no .
 She got worried .
 See , you 're her first regular .
 I 'm just here for the story .
 I figured there 'd be something freaky behind this door
 like a 50- foot python and what 's left of the UPS guy .
 And Earl guessed you were a man .
 No man .
 No , just me in here with my vagina and my photographs .
 Oh !
 You 're a photographer ?
 I love photography !
 And I love privacy .
 And I love pot .
 Oh , I thought we were going around .
 Come on .
 You better come in too .
 You 're the Yin to her Yap .
 Hey , careful where you step .
 I can 't find my third pair of glasses .
 It 's on top of your hat .
 No , that 's my fourth pair .
 Hey !
 This is Billy the bum !
 He used to live in a box around the corner from my apartment .
 He even let me stay over once when I had to get away from this bad roommate .
 Oh , the one before me ?
 No , it was you .
 You two are a riot together .
 You remind me of me and my old photographer friend
 Annie Leibovitz .
 Course , this was before ...
 Before she got famous ?
 No .
 Before she hit on me .
 I told her I wasn 't into girls .
 But ...
 I think she was confused by the derby .
 Yeah .
 I think we 're all a little confused by it .
 Nola , I want to ask you if you 've ever had any success , but I don 't know how to do that without insulting you .
 That 's correct .
 You don 't .
 Oh !
 You 're having a gallery show in SoHo ?
 Good- bye .
 Uh , it was nice of you two to , uh , come over , check on me .
 Uh ... weird , but nice .
 Perhaps we could come to the opening .
 Oh .
 Oh , you don 't need to do that .
 I know we don 't need to , but maybe I want to support you and your amazing work .
 - And Max would enjoy . the free wine .
 - Yes , I would .
 [ laughs ] No .
 Oh , I would .
 No as in , " No , don 't come . "
 Now , if you 'll excuse me ,
 I wanna eat my croutons without the vaudeville stylings of Shecky and Nosy .
 Here .
 Oh , yeah , good .
 I was looking for this .
 I can 't believe you 're doing all this for a diner regular .
 I haven 't seen you this desperate since Monday ,
 Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday .
 I know ... on the weekends , I just give up .
 Look that title !
 " The Great Unwashed . "
 Are Oleg 's balls here ?
 Max , it 's the " art scene . "
 Class it up .
 At least say testicles .
 Evening , ladies .

 And , Han , your sweater 's eating your head .
 I 'm here for the champagne and because I couldn 't find my way out .
 I just walked into a picture of a door .
 Some of these are going for thousands of dollars !
 That Nola bitch is rich , and I bet she has a frigging summer house made out of my free croutons !
 Han , it 's the art scene .
 Class it up .
 At least say " freaking . " Also , " testicles . "
 Well , I 'm not wasting this new turtleneck on you two .
 I 'm going to go mingle .
 A high fashion model was giving me the eye .
 Then she 'd have to be high .
 Uh , Han , I believe I 'll stay here .
 Nobody wins with a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle as a wingman .
 Oh , hey , everybody .


 So can I class it back down now ?
 Sorry we 're late .
 I was just over there admiring the photo of the happy couple under the bridge .
 Sophie , they 're two junkies sharing a needle . Happy couple ?



 Yeah , well , at least the lady junkie knows where his needle 's been .
 I don 't even think she knows her name .
 She knows more **
 She knows everything .
 You guys had been here for a while .
 Where 's the best place to steal some food ?
 - Max !
 - Sorry , sorry .
 Classing it up .
 Testicles some food .
 Oh , Max , I can tell by your sassdemeanor * you haven 't seen your photo yet .
 The photo . *
 Yep , that 's me , all right .
 I recognize that " I don 't care " pout and the Thousand Island dressing in my hair .
 Max , just because you 're hanging on a wall among the poorest , most lost souls in our city doesn 't mean your life is ...
 I 'm hanging right behind me , aren 't I ?
 Oh , my God !
 It could be worst .
 You could be naked .
 This is worse than being naked !
 I 'm wearing polyester !
 It 's bad ou I 'm a waitress in Brooklyn .
 Now I 'm a waitress in Manhattan , and these guys didn 't even tip !
 No , no , no , it 's a photograph so it 's more symbolic .
 It 's called " Waitress "
 And I 'm holding a checkpad .
 What those blue dots mean ?
 Is my picture in trouble ?
 That 's how many time your print has been purchased .
 Over here , Max , away from that phatetic blonde lady with a waitress uniform .
 Could you relax ?
 No one even recognized you .
 No one ?
 What about that art critic who said " my smile on the photo
 " was a study of tragic , foolish optimism in a hopeless , dead- end life " ?
 Oh ,
 Hopeless , dead- end life and the worse no one buys me ?
 I 'm not even a success .
 It 's a failure .
 You 're totally a sucess as failure .
 Then where are the blue dots , Max ?
 20 people bought you .
 Whatever you do , don 't turn around .
 Look at these dots !
 ♪♪
 Man , woman , black , white . ♪♪
 ♪♪
 Are you putting the dots by your friend 's photo ?
 How many extra croutons can you buy with *** of money you 're making from these photos ? ♪♪
 Okay , okay , I get it . * I 'll tell you what .
 I will give you a free print on your photo .
 Look , keep the photo .
 I don 't want a picute of me marrying kepchups .
 I don 't want a picture of me marrying anybody .
 But you can pay me back in another way .
 I told you .
 I 'm not a lesbian .
 I just wear hat !
 Your friend said you hated your photo .
 No !
 I enjoyed being secretly photographed while I 'm stealing someone extra , croutons .
 For the record ,
 I never saw your smile as foolish .
 I saw it as , uh ... just a little big .
 Uh ...
 I 'm trying to pay you a compliment .
 Well , you failed .
 All this time , when you looked at me ,
 I thought you saw something special , but all you really saw was someone reading the specials .
 I have a question for you .
 Okay , fine .
 I wear the derby because I have a little bit of a bald spot .
 Why didn 't I sell ?
 The picture sucks .
 One of my worst .
 If you 're still trying to give me a compliment , you 're still failing .
 Look , a good photograph captures the truth .
 And I guess no one really believes as a waitress .
 That is the single nicest thing anyone 's ever said to me .
 So it 's not where you wanna be ...
 I get it .
 Look , it 's taken me 50 years to be where I am .
 And you are still
 That is the second- nicest thing anyone 's ever said to me !
 The road is long , and trust me , it can be really hard .
 So whatever you do , you hold on to that foolishly hopeful smile .
 And ... your funny friend .
 - Yes ?
 - Yes .
 Uh , everyone , tonight we are witness to the amazing work of Nola Anderz .
 [ applause ]
 Why don 't we all just stand here quietly for a moment and let Nola 's pictures speak .
 [ cell phone ringing ]
 That 's my phone .
 Where is it ?
 [ ringing ]
 Baby , why is my phone in your bra ?
 Shh , please !
 It 's your secret phone !
 I know all about it .
 [ ringing ] You took it ?
 Give it to me .
 Who is she , Oleg ?
 Who is this skanky old whore ?
 Security !
 Security !
 What ... no , no , no !
 Stop , stop ... she has my phone .
 It 's his boner phone , everybody !
 It 's his boner phone !
 And you had the testicles to think
 I was gonna embarrass you .
 Hey , Sophie .
 Hey , girls .

 It sounds a little bit like ...
 I don 't know .
 The sound of cheating .
 You guys haven 't made up yet ?
 Don 't make up here .
 No .
 I slept on the couch .
 I missed her so much , I watched a romcom while eating a whole box of her edible underwear .
 Still not talking to me , Sophie ?
 For the last time , there 's nobody else but you .
 - I use that phone ...
 - Yes ?
 To ... Go on .
 - I use it to call ...
 - Cut to the chase !
 My mother .
 Is there no one he won 't sleep with ?
 I didn 't tell you because
 I didn 't want you to think I was a mama 's boy .
 Except when we play " Mama and Boy . "
 Well ...
 I 'll tell you what I told that girl at the Yankee Candle store .
 " I 'm not buyin ' it ! "
 It 's true , Sophie .
 I 'm afraid I 'm ... losing my hair .
 Oh ...
 Oleg .
 But don 't you know ...
 I mean , you could be balder than Jeremy Piven was 15 years ago , and I 'd still love ya .
 [ phone ringing ]
 Where 's my ... [ ringing ]
 Busted .
 Caroline , I have something for you .
 I 'm not signing another one of those giant birthday cards again .
 It 's my picture .
 Great .
 Now I have two of you that don 't wait on tables .
 " Thanks for the croutons .
 Nola . "
 Max , where are we gonna hang me ?
 Maybe you should hang yourself in the bathroom
 like I thought you would three years ago .
 Yep .
 I lost $20 on that bet .
 You know , Max , maybe I have to stop running away from this part of my life and embrace it , see it as part of my journey , my ... beautiful , exciting journey .

 If you don 't shut up , I 'm gonna hang you right here .
