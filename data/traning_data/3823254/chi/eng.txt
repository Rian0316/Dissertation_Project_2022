 00 : 00 : 02, 545 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 646 What color would you like to be ?
 Well , I 'd like to be green , but you know you always take it .
 That 's not true .
 Any color 's fine with me .
 Yeah , I could be a- a combination of blue and yellow .
 Blue and yellow make green .
 Well , then it 's settled .
 Hi . Ready to go ?
 Oh , good news , we ordered lunch , so we can all stay here and play Risk .
 Sheldon , we said that we would play games with you tonight .
 Oh , no , we 'll still be playing it tonight -- this game can easily take eight hours .
 Sweetie , you really thought I 'd want to do this ?
 No .
 Well , did you tell him that ?
 Yes .
 Did you say it out loud with words ?
 No .
 I don 't want to spend the whole day playing a board game .
 Yeah , well , you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth , now including the Haradwaith Territories .

 I will literally race you to the car .
 No , no , no , come on , don 't leave .
 Just try it . No .
 We 're always doing what you guys want .
 Just once , it 'd be nice if you did something we wanted .
 You want to be green ?
 You know , they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we 're into .
 Yeah , we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director 's commentary .
 Oh , my favorite -- George Lucas can talk all the way through I say one word and I 'm banished to the kitchen .

 Yeah , today Amy and I are deciding what we 're all gonna do .
 You got it , you girls are in charge .
 Thank you .
 Sheldon ?
 Fine .
 Now that we 're not playing , you can be green .
 And since you 're green this time , I can be it next time .
 Thank you .
 All right , let 's see .
 What 's something fun the guys would never take us to do ?
 Oh , I know -- we could go horseback riding .
 I actually can 't .
 My hips don 't open wider than 22 degrees .
 I rode a very thin pony once .
 On the first bump ... just popped right off .
 All right , well , what do you want to do ?
 There 's a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire .
 Well , that 's Wilshire 's problem .
 Come on , you know , there- there 's got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate .
 Hang on , why do we have to hate it ?
 Three words :
 convention .
 I- I did not force you to go to that .
 You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie .
 I went so you didn 't get beat up .
 I wasn 't gonna get beat up .
 You were , but somehow I held myself back .
 You know what you could make us do ?
 Ice- skating .
 The cold air will trigger Leonard 's asthma and it plays right into my well- known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni .
 Now you 're helping them find ways to make us miserable ?
 Well , I 'm sorry , Leonard , I 'm a problem- solver , it 's what I do .
 I actually can 't go ice- skating .
 I have unnaturally brittle ankles .
 Is there any part of your body that 's normal ?

 Original Air Date on January 8 , 2015

 Oh , my God , oh , my God , oh , my God .
 Will you please relax ?
 I can 't take it , dude .
 You okay ?
 No , I 'm not okay .
 I feel like
 I 'm gonna jump out of my skin .
 I told you not to wax down there .
 It 's itchy when it grows back .
 I 'm worried about the New Horizons space probe .
 What 's he talking about ?
 Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto .
 It 's finally close enough , so this morning it turned itself on .
 We hope .
 The signal has to travel over three billion miles .
 So it 's gonna be hours before we know if it even survived .
 Now we get to see him flip out because he 's worried it was demolished by space ice .
 Space ice is no joke .
 I can 't even watch anymore .
 Ooh , the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown .
 Yeah , well , before you say yes , it 's not the movie about the big dog .
 How come we can 't think of something we both want to do ?
 Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it .
 Ah , interesting -- we 're being accused of making you do things you don 't like , and here you are , doing the same thing to poor Amy .

 You should point out the hypocrisy of that .
 That 's what I was doing .
 Oh , that wasn 't clear .
 Try it again , but this time drive it home with , " How do you like them apples , Missy ? "
 All right , keep thinking .
 You 're making it too complicated .
 Why not stick to the basics ?
 Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses , hmm ?
 I know I 'd hate that .
 Leonard ?
 Well , yeah .
 Well , then , it 's settled ?
 What do you say ?
 Sounds kind of perfect .
 It does -- somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it .
 Well , once again , it 's what I do .
 Oh , another two hours to go .
 The wait is killing me .
 I know .
 I get it .
 When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station , plummeting toward Earth at 17, 000 miles per hour ...
 Before you finish , is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space ?
 A story can do two things .
 Ugh , I feel like I 'm gonna have a heart attack .
 You work in pharmaceuticals -- don 't you have anything you can give him ?
 All I have is our new urine flow drug .
 Won 't help with his anxiety , but it 's so strong , when he pees he 'll fly around the room like he 's got a jet pack .
 I can 't stop thinking about it .
 You know , worrying won 't have any effect on what happens .
 I know .
 Maybe you need to do something more productive .
 ( sighs ) Okay .
 Ah .
 If I make this shot in the trash can , the probe will have arrived in perfect working order .

 So , in addition to being crazy , you 're resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess .
 Yes .
 The man who crashed his stationary bike .
 I didn 't crash it , okay ?
 My playlist was too up- tempo ,
 I got light- headed and I fell off .
 Okay .
 It all ... comes down ... to this .

 You happy ?
 Now you can relax .
 What kind of scientist are you ?
 Everyone knows you got to make two out of three .
 This isn 't so bad .
 That 's easy for you to say .
 Your chair 's not facing the lingerie section .
 Boy , that 's a lot of panties .
 You guys comfy ?
 This might take a while .
 You know , I don 't understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes .
 No , you 're right , we should do what you do .
 Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston .
 They have a man there who understands my personal style .
 Bye .
 Uh , I 've got some bad news .
 There 's no cell service in here .
 Oh .
 Well , that 's all right .
 There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented .
 That 's true .
 I 'll look them up .
 Son of a biscuit .
 Sheldon , it 's fine .
 No , it 's not fine .
 What kind of store in the 21st century doesn 't at least have Wi- Fi ?
 I 'm going to call their corporate office ...
 Son of a biscuit !
 Let 's see , my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland .
 And I roll ...
 a five and a three .
 Okay .
 And to defend , I roll ... two sixes .

 I win . Boy , double- sixes again .
 You know ... if I hadn 't seen it with my own eyes , I wouldn 't believe it .
 I wonder how long we 're gonna be stuck here .
 I don 't know , but the girls do a lot for us .
 It 's the least we can do .
 Oh , that 's true .
 I suppose it 's only fair we make compromises .
 Look at you , being all mature .
 I don 't know why you 're so surprised .
 If there 's one thing I know about after living with you for so many years , it 's how to compromise .
 I- I 'm sorry ?
 You make compromises for me ?
 All the time .
 On Earth ?
 In our lives ?
 That- That we 're living ?
 Oh , yes .
 I ...
 Just yesterday , you had a- a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch .
 Did I say anything ?
 No .
 I compromised and kept my mouth shut .
 Like you should 've , because everyone was laughing at you .
 That is not a compromise .
 A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how .
 Oh , I learned how .
 Amy taught me .
 What ?
 Then- Then why don 't you do it ?
 Uh , well , it 's scary .
 And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up .
 But , more importantly , driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose .
 I can 't take that away from you , so ... what do I do ?
 Oh , come on , I 'm practically feeding you the answer .
 I compromise .
 Hey , uh , thanks for keeping me company .
 I 'm happy to .
 I think getting out of the apartment will do you good .
 So ... where we headed ?
 If it 's okay with you , I 'd like to go to temple .
 Buddy , trust me , you don 't want to convert to Judaism .
 I mean , I know I make it look cool , but ... it 's not all briskets and dreidels .
 I meant a Hindu temple .
 Oh .
 Okay .
 It 's not like right ?
 Some bald guy with horns isn 't gonna rip my heart out .
 Dude , that movie 's an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion
 look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians .
 You love that movie .
 Yeah , it 's pretty great .
 I 'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious .
 Why ?
 Well , because I 've known you for ten years and you 've never gone to temple , you never talked about believing in God , and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house .


 Religion is a very personal thing .
 I do go to temple -- I just ...
 I don 't talk about it .
 Yeah , but you 're a scientist .
 So ?
 So , as a scientist , you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence , and now you 're counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you ?


 That is so offensive .
 Does everything you know about Hinduism come from
 No .
 There 's also Apu from
 Well , lots of scientists believe in God .
 Okay ?
 Newton , uh , Faraday , uh , Pascal -- all were believers .
 Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that " God does not play dice with the universe . "
 Well , of course he believed in God -- he slept with Marilyn Monroe .
 Actually there 's no proof of that .
 You believe in your religion , I 'll believe in mine .
 How 's it going in there ?
 Eh .
 Not really a great outfit for work , unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division .
 Hey , can I ask you something ?
 Sure .
 Do I really force you to do things you don 't want to ?
 Yeah , but it 's okay .
 How is it okay ?
 I promised myself , if I ever got friends ,
 I 'd do whatever they said .
 Really , I 'm lucky you found me before a cult did .
 Well , you know , that was a long time ago .
 You 're a different woman now .
 You 're smart , you 've got great friends , you 've got a boyfriend , you 're pretty , you have zero fashion sense , but ...
 Anyway , tonight we 're gonna do whatever you want .
 Really ?
 Absolutely .
 You name it , we 're doing it .
 Basket weaving at the craft museum .
 Well , you named it .
 Oh , here 's another one .
 I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an " A , " but I don 't put it there because I don 't want you breaking one of your little legs when you 're supposed to be making my breakfast .


 Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make ?
 I wasn 't done , but go ahead .
 He said , compromising .
 Because of you , I 'm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home .
 I 'm not allowed to whistle .
 I don 't wear shoes that might squeak .
 Well , you 're a physicist , not a circus clown .
 Sheldon , do you realize I don 't live with the woman I love because of you ?
 No other reason .
 Just you .
 Is that true ?
 Yes , it 's true .
 The last time
 I brought it up , you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away .
 Well , given my history on the subject , it seems a little reckless to bring it up now .
 You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you .
 It 's exhausting !
 You know what ?
 You think you 're so tolerant , but the truth is ... you 're mean to me a lot .
 Yeah , you think that I don 't notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls , but I do .
 Hmm ?
 I have excellent peripheral vision .
 On a good day , I can see my ears .
 Sheldon , I- I 'm sorry if I hurt your feelings .
 I 've been holding a lot of this in for a while .
 Well , I 'm sorry , too .
 And if you want to live with Penny , then I think you should .
 Do you mean that ?
 Yeah , just put on your squeaky shoes and ... ( mimics squeaking ) your way out of my life . Yes .



 Come on , don 't get upset .
 I 'm not upset .
 I 'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it .
 Sheldon .
 It 's okay .
 I- I 'm not leaving your world .
 I 'm just talking about living across the hall .
 I understand .
 Either way , I want you to know that ...
 I 'm aware of how difficult I can be .
 So I just want to say ... thank you for putting up with me .
 Buddy ...
 How are you guys getting alo ... ?
 What ?
 Why are there tears ?
 Everything 's fine .
 We just started talking about living arrangements .
 Are you crazy ?
 You know he 's a flight risk .
 That 's exactly what I told him .
 Sheldon , we know this is a sensitive subject , and Leonard 's not gonna move out until you 're ready .
 Well , what if you did it gradually ?
 All right .
 Well ... how about we start with two nights a week
 I live with Penny ?
 How about one night and ...
 I let you whistle ?
 Okay .
 When I 'm not home .
 You got it .
 There we go , compromising again .
 We really are the best .
 Here we go , my first Hindu temple .
 You see behind the fountain , that tower
 It 's called a Sikhara .
 It symbolizes the- the connection between the human and the divine .
 Huh .
 I always thought it was mini golf .
 All right .
 Shall we ?
 Yeah .
 Just , uh , is there anything I should know before I go in ?
 Like what ?
 Like am I dressed okay ?
 So every other place you 've been , you thought this was fine ? Really ?


 I know you 're under a lot of pressure , so I 'm gonna let that pass .
 ( sighs ) Sorry .
 You 're right .
 I 'm so stressed .
 But you know what , whenever I walk into that temple
 I realize that whatever happens , it 's okay .
 We 're all part of an immense pattern , and though we can 't understand it , we can be happy to know that it 's- it 's working its will through us .
 That 's nice . ( chuckles )
 Whether you call it God or the universe or the self , we 're all interconnected , and that 's just a beautiful ...
 Son of a bitch !
 That guy just dinged my car !
 ( gasps ) S- Seriously ?
 Y- You were just gonna drive away ?
 Like my life isn 't hard enough right now .
 A space probe might be destroyed , my parents are going through an awful divorce , the guy who cuts my dog 's hair just gave her bangs !
 Raj .
 You saw her .
 She looks like Jim Carrey from
 Raj , you just got a text .
 The probe turned on .
 It 's fine .
 ( sighs ) Oh , good .
 Grandpa .
 I thought this was gonna be boring , but it 's actually kind of fun .
 Don 't tell Amy that .
 We 'll be here every Sunday .
 Sheldon , that really is an excellent basket .
 It 's not a basket .
 It 's a soldier 's helmet from 16th century China .
 Very nice .
 Yeah , it looks great .
 I saw that .
 Well , roomie , it 's only one night a week , but it 's a start .
 I know .
 I 'm really proud of Sheldon .
 Yeah , I 'm proud of him , too .
 Some of us are trying to sleep out here . SHELDON :
 Can you keep it down ?
