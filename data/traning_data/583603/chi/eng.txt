 How 'd someone get your credit card number ?
 I have no idea . Look how much they spent !
 Calm down .
 You only have to pay for the stuff you bought .
 StiIl , it 's just such reckless spending .
 When somebody steals your credit card . . . . . . they 've kind of already thrown caution to the wind .
 Wow , what a geek .
 They spent $69 . 95 on a Wonder Mop .
 That 's me .
 He 's doing it again !
 Marcel , stop humping the Iamp !
 Stop humping !
 Now , Marcel , come back ! Come here , Marcel ! Oh , no , no !
 Not in my room !
 I 'II get him .
 You 've got to do something about the humping .
 What ? It 's just a phase .
 WeIl , that 's what we said about Joey .
 Hey , would you aII relax ?
 It 's not that big a deal .
 Marcel , stop it ! Marcel ! Bad monkey !
 What ?
 Let 's just say my Curious George doII is no Ionger curious .
 The One With the Fake Monica
 English Subtitles by GELULA & CO . , INC .





 Monica , you are not stiII going over that thing .
 - This woman 's Iiving my Iife .
 - What ?
 She 's Iiving my Iife , and she 's doing it better than me .
 Look at this .
 Look .
 She buys tickets to plays I want to see .
 She shops at stores that I 'm intimidated by the salespeople .
 She spent $300 on art supplies .
 You 're not an artist .
 Yeah , weIl , I might be if I had the supplies .
 I mean , I could do aII this stuff . Only I don 't .
 Oh , Monica , come on .
 You do cooI things . Oh , reaIly ?
 Let 's compare , shaII we ?
 Oh , it 's so Iate for " shaII we . "
 Do I go horseback riding in the park ?
 Do I take classes at The New School ?
 This is so unfair .
 She 's got everything I want , and she doesn 't have my mother .
 How about Joey Paponi ?
 No , stiII too ethnic .
 My agent thinks I should have a name that 's more neutral .
 Joey Switzerland ?
 Plus I think it should be Joe .
 Joey makes me sound Iike I 'm . . . . . . this big .
 Which I 'm not !
 Joe , Joe , Joe . . . . Stalin ?
 Stalin . Do I know that name ?
 That sounds familiar . WeIl , it does not ring a beII with me .
 Joe Stalin . You know , that 's pretty good .
 You might want to try Joseph .
 Joseph Stalin !
 - I think you 'd remember that !
 - Oh , yes ! Bye Bye Birdie , starring Joseph Stalin .
 Joseph Stalin is The Fiddler on the Roof !
 Hi . Yes , this is Monica GeIler .
 I 'm taking classes with you , and I was wondering what they were .
 What are you doing ?
 AII right , great . Great .
 Thanks a Iot . I 'm going to tap class .
 So you can dance with the woman that stole your card ?
 She 's got my Iife .
 I want to see who she is .
 Go to the post office ! I 'm sure her picture 's up !
 Honey , you 're kind of Iosing it here .
 This is reaIly becoming a weird obsession .
 This is madness , I teII you .
 For the love of God , Monica , don 't do it !
 Thank you .
 What do you think ? Lots of things .
 Which one do you think she is ?
 - May I help you ? - No , thanks .
 We 're just here to observe .
 You don 't observe a dance class .
 You dance a dance class !
 Spare shoes are over there .
 What does she mean ?
 I think she means , " You dance . . . . . . a dance class ! "
 Come on , come on , come on !
 ReaIly ?
 Hey , do you see anybody you think could be me ?
 People , Iast time there were yogurt containers Iying around after class .
 Let 's not have that happen again !
 She could be you .
 Let 's get started .
 Five , six .
 Five , six , seven , eight .
 Okay , I 'm not getting this !
 I 'm totaIly getting it !
 Do you ever just feeI Iike you 're so unbelievably uncoordinated ?
 What ? You just click when they click .
 AII right . Now everyone grab a partner .
 AII right .
 And my dead mother said you are it ! I 'm with Rachel .
 Great , it 's gym class aII over again .
 That 's aII right .
 You can come up to the front and dance with me .
 Why don 't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare ?
 It 's okay , it 's okay ! I 'm here , I 'm here . I 'm so sorry I 'm Iate .
 Okay , here I am . So who 's the new tense girl ?
 She 's your partner .
 Hi , I 'm Monica .

 Hi , I 'm Mon -- Nana .
 Monana .
 It 's Dutch .
 You 're kidding . I spent three years in Amsterdam .
 Pennsylvania Dutch .
 And we 're dancing ! Five , six , seven , eight .
 - Where have you been ?
 - I just got back from the vet .
 She 's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone , is she ?
 She says Marcel 's humping thing is not a phase .
 Apparently , he 's reached sexuaI maturity .
 Hey , he beat you !
 She says , as time goes on , he 'II start getting aggressive and violent .
 What does this mean ? I have to give him up .

 I can 't believe it . This sucks !
 You just got him .
 How could he be an adult already ?
 I know , I know .
 One day he 's this Iittle thing . . . . . . and before you know it , he 's this Iittle thing . . . . . . I can 't get off my Ieg .
 Isn 't there any way you can keep him ?
 The vet said that unless he 's in a place . . . . . . where he has regular access . . . . . . to some monkey Ioving . . .
 . . . he 's just gonna get vicious .
 I just gotta get him into a zoo .
 - How do you get a monkey into a zoo ?
 - I know that one !
 No , that 's Popes into a Volkswagen .
 We 're applying to a Iot of them .
 Our first choice would be a state zoo .
 You know , Iike San Diego . Right ?
 But that may just be a pipe dream because he 's out- of- state .
 My vet knows someone at Miami , so that 's a possibility .
 But that 's two blocks from the beach .
 It 's a totaI party zoo .
 We found the girl !
 - What ? - Did you caII the cops ?
 Nope . We took her to Iunch .
 Your own brand of vigilante justice .
 Are you insane ? This woman stole from you !
 She stole ! She 's a stealer !
 After you 're with this woman for 1 0 minutes , you forget aII that .
 I mean , she 's this astounding person . . . . . . with this amazing spirit !
 Yeah , which she probably stole from some cheerleader !
 - Take off their hats .
 - Popes in a Volkswagen !
 I love that joke .
 - No way ! No way did you do this !
 - Monana was very brave .
 It was so wild .
 We told them we were the Gunnersons in room 61 5 . . . . . . only to find out the Boston Celtics had the entire sixth floor !
 So when they caught on that we were short and have breasts . . . .
 They threw us out .
 I was thrown out of a hotel ! Me !
 Go , Monana !
 WeIl , you Iadies are not the only ones Iiving the dream .
 I get to go pour coffee for people I don 't know .
 Don 't wait up .
 Oh , by the way . . . . . . tomorrow we 're auditioning for a Broadway show .
 Excuse me ?
 There 's an open caII for Cats .
 I 'm thinking we go down there , sing " Memories " . . . . . . and make complete fools of ourselves .
 What do you say ?
 Remember who you 're dealing with here .
 I 'm not Iike you .
 I can 't even stand in front of a tap class .
 That 's because of your Amish background .
 You 're Pennsylvania Dutch , right ?
 Right . TiII I bought a blow dryer . Then I was shunt .
 I was just Iike you .
 And then one day , I saw a movie that changed my Iife .
 Did you ever see Dead Poet 's Society ?
 I thought that movie was so incredibly . . . . . . boring !
 I mean , that thing at the end where the kid . . . . . . kiIls himself because he can 't be in the play ?
 What was that ?
 It 's Iike , " Kid , wait a year . Leave home , do some community theater ! "
 As I walked out , I thought . . . . . . " Now that 's two hours of my Iife that I 'm never getting back ! "
 And that scared me more than aII the other crap I was afraid to do !
 Wow .
 Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire .
 Oh , God .
 We didn 't get into Scranton .
 That was our safety zoo .
 They take , Iike , dogs and cows .
 I don 't know who this is harder on , me or him .
 I 'd say that chair 's taking the brunt of it .

 Good boy ! See ? How can nobody want him ?
 Somebody wiIl .
 You know , there already is a Joseph Stalin ?
 You 're kidding !
 Apparently , he was a Russian dictator who slaughtered aII these people !
 - You 'd think you would 've known that !
 - You 'd think I would 've .
 Phoebe , what do you think a good stage name for me would be ?
 Flame Boy !
 Where exactly is your zoo ?
 WeIl , it 's technicaIly not a zoo per se .
 It 's more of an interactive - wildIife experience .
 Let me ask you some questions about -- Is it Marcel ?
 Does he fight with other animals ?
 No , no . He 's very docile .
 Even if he were cornered ?
 WeIl , I don 't know . Why ?
 How is he at handling smaII objects ?
 He can hold a banana , if that 's what you mean .
 What about a hammer or a smaII blade ?
 Why would he need a blade ?
 If he 's up against a jungle cat or an animaI with horns . . . . . . you 've got to give the Iittle guy something .
 Otherwise , it 's just cruel !
 He got into San Diego ! What ?
 We were coming back from our walk , and the phone was ringing . . . .
 He 's in ! Did you hear that , Marcel ?
 It 's San Diego !
 San Diego !
 You 're making a mistake .
 San Diego 's weII and good . . . . . . but if you give him to me , I 'II start him against a blind rabbit . . . . . . and give you 20 % of the gate .

 Where have you been ?
 Monica and I just crashed an embassy party .
 Are you drunk ? No !

 I 'm Iying . I am so drunk ! Oh , God !
 Great . You know what ? You could have caIled .
 I 've been up here . I 've been worried --

 Water rules ! Yes .
 Yes , it does . The restaurant caIled .
 They want to know if you 're showing up .
 Nope !
 I 'm going to the Big Apple Circus today .
 What are you doing ?
 You 're gonna Iose your job . This is not you !
 No , it is me !
 I 'm not just the person who needs to fluff the piIlows . . . . . . and pay the biIls as soon as they come in !
 You know , when I 'm with her , I 'm so much more than that !
 I 'm Monana !
 Yes , she is . Hold on a second , please .
 Monana , it 's for you .
 The credit card people .
 Oh , my God !
 Thanks . What ?
 They 've arrested Monica .
 How are you ? I 'm not too bad .
 Fortunately , blue 's my color .
 How did you know I was here ?
 Because . . .
 . . . I 'm Monica GeIler .
 It was my credit card you were using .
 That I was not expecting .
 I want you to know , I didn 't turn you in .
 - Thanks . - No , thank you .
 You have given me so much .
 Without you , I 'd have never gotten . . . . . . to sing " Memories " at the Wintergarden Theater .
 ActuaIly , you only got to sing " Memo -- "
 I can 't believe you 're in here .
 What am I gonna do without you ?
 Who 's gonna crash the embassy parties with me ?
 Who 's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus ?
 Monica , I started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women . . . . . . and you 're worried about who wiII take you to the Big Apple Circus ?
 WeIl , not worried , you know , just wondering .
 There 's nothing to wonder about .
 You 'II go back to being who you were because that 's who you are .
 - Not necessarily .
 - Yes , necessarily . I don 't know what it is .
 Maybe it 's the Amish thing .
 I 'm not actuaIly Amish . ReaIly ?
 Then why are you Iike that ?
 You by the door , in or out ? In !

 You in the back , you 're getting it wrong !
 At Ieast I 'm doing it !
 This is the final boarding call for Flight 67 to San Diego ... ... boarding at gate 42A .
 Okay , goodbye , Iittle monkey guy . AII right , I wrote you this poem .
 Okay , but don 't eat it tiII you get on the plane .
 Thank you , Aunt Phoebe .
 Okay , bye , champ .
 There 's gonna be a Iot of babes in San Diego . . . . . . but remember , there 's also a Iot to Iearn .
 I don 't know what to say . It 's a monkey .
 Just say what you feel .
 Marcel , I 'm hungry . That was good .

 Marcel , this is for you .
 It 's just , you know , something . . . . . . to do on the plane .
 If you don 't mind , I 'd Iike a moment , just me and him . - Oh , sure .
 Absolutely . - Go ahead .
 Marcel , come here . Come here .
 Come here .
 WeIl , buddy . . . . . . this is it .
 There 's just a couple of things I wanted to say . I 'm reaIly gonna miss you .

 You know , I 'm never gonna forget about you .
 You 've been more than . . . . . . just a pet to me .
 You 've been more Iike a --
 Would you Ieave my Ieg alone ?
 Would you just stop humping me for two seconds ?
 Okay , would you just take him away ?
 Just take him .
 O , that I were a glove upon that hand that I might . . . . . . touch thy cheek !
 That 's fine . Thank you .
 Next .
 I 'II be reading for the role of Mercutio . - Name ?
 - Holden McGroin .
