 You can spot someone who 's never seen his plays .
 Notice , no fear .
 No sense of impending doom .
 The exclamation point scares me .
 It 's not just Freud , it 's Freud !
 Magic is about to happen !

 And I would have to say . . . . . . your problem is quite clear .
 All you want is a dinkle

 I feeI violated .
 Did anybody else feeI Iike peeling their skin off . . . . . . to have something else to do ?
 Ross , 1 0 : 00 .
 Is it ? It feels Iike 2 .
 No , 1 0 : 00 !

 There 's a beautifuI woman at 8 , 9 , 1 0 : 00 !
 HeIlo ! She 's amazing !
 She makes the women I dream about Iook Iike short , fat , bald men .
 Go over to her . She 's not with anyone .
 And what would my opening Iine be ?
 Excuse me . . . .
 Come on , she 's a person . You can do it .
 Could she be more out of my Ieague ?
 Ross , back me up .
 He could never get a woman Iike that in a miIlion years .
 But you always see these beautifuI women with these " nothing " guys .
 You could be one of those guys .
 - You could do that .
 - You think ? Absolutely !
 I can 't believe I 'm even considering this .
 - I 'm very aware of my tongue .
 - Come on . Here goes .

 Okay , next word would be . . . . . . Chandler .
 Chandler is my name and . . . .
 Hi ! Yes , you said that . Yes !
 Yes , I did .
 But what I didn 't say . . . . . . what I wanted to say was . . . . . . would you Iike to go out with me ?
 Good night .
 Chandler ?
 Thank you .
 There he is !
 - I didn 't know you could dance !
 - You were in a play !
 What 'd you think ?
 - I didn 't know you could dance !
 - You were in a play !
 Come on , it wasn 't that bad .
 I was the Iead .
 It was better than the troII thing .
 At Ieast you got to see my head .
 - You 're right . - We saw your head .
 She said yes !
 She said yes !
 AwfuI play , man !
 Her name 's Aurora .
 She 's Italian and she pronounces my name " Chandler . "
 I Iike that better .
 The usher gave me this to give to you .
 - What is it ? - The EsteIle Leonard Talent Agency .
 An agency Ieft me its card . Maybe they wanna sign me !
 Based on this play ?
 Based on this play !
 Hey , kids !
 No , because this Iine is passion , and this is just a Iine .
 I 've been here seven seconds , and you haven 't asked me how my date went .
 How was your date , Chandler ?
 It was unbelievable !
 I 've never met anyone Iike her .
 She 's had the most amazing Iife !
 She was in the Israeli army .
 None of the buIlets hit the engine block . . . . . . so we made it to the border .
 But just barely and I. . . . I 've been talking about myself aII night Iong .
 I 'm sorry . What about you ? TeII me your stories .
 AII right , once . . . . . . once I got on the subway , right ? And it was at night . . . . . . and I rode it aII the way to Brooklyn . . . . . . just for the heII of it .

 We talked tiII 2 .
 It was this perfect evening .
 More or Iess .
 Suddenly , we realized we were in Yemen .
 I 'm sorry , so " we " is . . . ?
 " We " is me and Rick .
 Who 's Rick ?
 Who 's Rick ?
 My husband .
 - Oh , so you 're divorced ?
 - No .
 I 'm sorry . So you 're widowed ? HopefuIly ?
 No , I 'm stiII married .
 So how would your husband feeI about you sitting here with me . . . . . . sliding your foot so far up my Ieg . . . . . . you can count the change in my pocket ?
 Don 't worry .
 I imagine he 'd be okay with you because he 's okay with Ethan .
 Ethan ? There 's an Ethan ?
 Ethan is my . . . . . . boyfriend .
 What ? !
 What kind of relationship do you imagine us having . . . . . . if you already have a husband and a boyfriend ?
 I suppose , mainly sexual .
 I 'm sorry it didn 't work out .
 What not work out ? I 'm seeing her again on Thursday .
 Didn 't you Iisten to the story ?
 Didn 't you Iisten to the story ?
 How could you get involved with a woman Iike this ?
 I had trouble with it at first .
 But I get aII the good stuff .
 AII the fun , aII the talking , aII the sex . . . . . . and no responsibility .
 This is every guy 's fantasy !
 That is not true . Ross , is this your fantasy ?
 No , of course not .
 Yeah . Yeah , it is .
 You 'd go out with someone else who 's going out with someone else ?
 I couldn 't .
 Good for you .
 When I 'm with a woman , I need to know . . . . . . that I 'm going out with more people than she is .
 You know . . . . . . monogamy can be a tricky concept .
 I mean , anthropologicaIly speaking . . . .
 Fine . Now you 'II never know .
 We 're kidding . TeII us . - We wanna know .
 - Come on ! AII right .
 There 's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey --
 Are we greeting each other this way now ?
 I Iike that .
 Look ! I cleaned !
 I did the windows . I did the floors .
 I used aII the attachments on the vacuum except for that round one .
 I don 't know what it 's for .
 Nobody knows , and we 're not supposed to ask .
 What do you think ? - It 's very clean .
 - ReaIly , it Iooks great !
 I see you moved the green ottoman .
 How did that happen ?
 I don 't know . I thought it Iooked better there .
 And also , it 's an extra seat around the coffee table .
 Yeah , it 's interesting .
 But you know what ?
 Just for fun . . . . . . Iet 's see what it Iooked Iike in the old spot .
 Just to compare .
 Let 's see . WeIl , it Iooks good there too .
 Let 's Ieave it there for a while .
 I can 't believe you tried to move the green ottoman .
 Thank God you didn 't fan out the magazines .
 She 'II scratch your eyes out .
 You guys , I am not that bad ! Yeah , you are .
 Remember , I Iived with you ?
 You were a Iittle , you know . . . .
 That is so unfair !
 When we were kids , yours was the only Raggedy Ann doII that wasn 't raggedy .
 Okay , so I 'm responsible . I 'm organized .
 But , hey , I can be a kook !
 AII right , you madcap gal ! Try to imagine this .
 The phone biII arrives , but you don 't pay it right away .
 Why not ? Because you 're a kook !
 Instead , you wait untiI they send you a notice . I could do that .
 Okay , then you Iet me go grocery shopping . . . . . . and I buy Iaundry detergent .
 But it 's not the one with the easy- pour spout .
 Why would someone do that ?
 One might wonder .
 A glass is on the table . There 's no coaster .
 It 's a cold drink .
 It 's a hot day . Beads of condensation are inching their way closer to the wood . . . . Stop it !
 Oh , my God ! It 's true . Who am I ?
 Monica , you 're Mom .
 Oh , my God ! Okay , I 'II be there .
 That was my agent .
 My agent has just gotten me a job in the new AI Pacino movie !
 That 's great !
 What 's the part ?
 Can you believe this ? AI Pacino !
 This guy 's why I became an actor .
 " I 'm out of order ? You 're out of order !
 This whole courtroom 's out of order ! "
 Seriously , what 's the part ?
 " Just when I thought I was out , they puII me back in ! "
 Come on . Seriously , Joey , what 's the part ?
 You 're , you 're . . . . What ?
 I 'm his butt double , okay ?
 I play AI Pacino 's butt .
 He goes into the shower , and then . . . . . . I 'm his butt .
 AII right ?
 Oh , my God !
 Come on , you guys . This is a reaI movie and AI Pacino 's in it and that 's big !
 Oh , no , it 's terrific .
 After aII your years of struggling . . . . . . you 've finaIly been able to crack your way into show business .
 Okay , fine . Make jokes , I don 't care .
 This is a big break for me ! You 're right .
 It is . So are you gonna invite us aII to the big opening ?

 - I need to borrow some moisturizer .
 - For what ?
 What do you think ?
 Today 's the big day !
 Okay , go into the bathroom . Use whatever you want .
 Just don 't ever teII me what you did in there .
 Thank you .
 - Joey 's mom 's on the phone .
 - He 's in the bathroom .
 - You don 't wanna go in there !
 - Come on , we 're roommates .
 My eyes ! My eyes !
 I warned you .
 Who is being Ioud ?
 Oh , that would be Monica .
 Can I borrow some things ?
 I wanna make Aurora breakfast . You got the whole night , huh ?
 WeIl , I only have 20 minutes untiI Ethan , so . . . .
 Do I sense a bit of resentment ? No , no , no .
 No resentment . Believe me . . . . . . it 's worth it , okay ?
 In a relationship , you have these key moments . . . . . . you 'II remember for the rest of your Iife .
 WeIl , every single second is Iike that with Aurora .
 And I 've just wasted 35 of them talking to you .
 So , Monica , can you help me with the door ?
 You know , the old Monica would remind you . . . . . . to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush .
 But I 'm not gonna do that .
 Damn it !
 Hire the girl .
 Okay , everybody ready ?
 Listen , I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity .
 Lose the robe . Me ?
 That would work .
 Right . Okay .
 Losing the robe !
 Okay , and the robe is Iost .
 Everybody , I would Iike to get this in one take .
 Let 's roII it . Water 's working .
 And action !
 And cut !
 Butt guy , what are you doing ?
 I 'm showering .
 No , that was clenching .
 WeIl , the way I see it , the guy 's upset here , you know ?
 His wife 's dead , his brother 's missing .
 I think his butt would be angry here .
 I think his butt would Iike to get the shot before Iunch .
 Once again , roIling .
 Water working .
 And action !
 And cut !
 What was that ?
 I was going for quiet desperation .
 But if you have to ask . . . .
 God , I love these fingers .
 Thank you . No , actuaIly , I meant my fingers .
 Look at them .
 Look at how happy they are .
 - Oh , my God , I 'm Iate !
 - Oh , no , no , no . - Don 't go , don 't go .
 - Okay , okay . - I have to .
 - Look , she 's Ieaving .
 I 'm sorry .
 He 'II be waiting for me .
 I thought you talked to Rick .
 It 's not Rick . Ethan ?
 He gets the whole day with you !
 No , it 's Andrew .
 I know there 'II be many moments . . . . . . when I 'II regret asking the foIlowing question , but . . . .
 And Andrew is . . . ?
 He 's . . . . . . new .
 So you 're not completely fulfiIled by Rick , Ethan and myself ?
 No , that 's not exactly what I was --
 Most women would kiIl . . . . . . for three guys Iike us .
 So what do you want ?
 You .
 - You have me .
 - No , no . Just you .
 What do you mean ?
 Lose the other guys .
 Like , aII of them ?
 Come on , we 're great together .
 Why not ?
 Why can 't we just have what we have now ?
 Why can 't we just talk , Iaugh and make Iove . . . . . . without feeling obligated to one another ?
 Up untiI tonight , I thought that 's what you wanted too .
 WeIl , part of me wants that . . . . . . but it 's Iike I 'm two guys .
 I mean , one guy 's saying , " Shut up ! This is great ! "
 But there 's this other guy .
 It 's the guy who weIls up every time the Grinch 's heart . . . . . . grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device .
 He 's saying , you know , " This is too hard .
 Get out , get out ! "
 So which one of the two guys wiII you Iisten to ?
 I have to Iisten to both .
 They don 't Iet each other finish .
 Which one ?
 The second guy .
 I see .
 CaII me if you change your mind .
 Sorry , the first guy runs the Iips .
 Look at it this way . You dumped her !
 Right ? I mean , this woman was . . . . . . unbelievably sexy . . . . . . and beautiful , inteIligent , unattainable . . . .
 TeII me why you did this again ?
 Movie star !
 Aren 't you the guy who plays the butt in the new AI Pacino movie ?
 Nope .
 No ? What happened , big guy ?
 Big guy ?
 It felt Iike a " big guy " moment .
 I got fired !
 They said I acted too much with it .
 I told everybody about this . Everybody wiII be expecting to see me .
 You know what ? No one wiII be able to teIl .
 My mom wiIl .
 There 's something so sweet . . . . . . and disturbing about that .
 I 've done nothing but crappy plays for six years . . . . . . and I finaIly get my shot , and I blow it !
 Maybe this wasn 't your shot .
 I think when it 's your shot , you know it 's your shot .
 Did it feeI Iike your shot ?
 Hard to teIl . I was naked .
 I don 't think this was your shot .
 I don 't even think you just get one shot .
 I reaIly believe big things are gonna happen for you .
 I do . You 've gotta keep thinking about the day that some kid wiII go . . . . . . " I got the part !
 I 'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani 's ass ! "
 You think ? That 's so nice .
 I 'm sorry , Joey .
 I 'm gonna go to bed , guys .
 Good night .
 You 're gonna Ieave your shoes out here ?
 ReaIly ? Just casuaIly strewn about . . . . . . in that reckless , haphazard manner ?
 It doesn 't matter .
 I 'II get them tomorrow . Or not !
 Whenever .
 She is a kook .
 If it bothers you that much , just go out and get the shoes .
 No , don 't do this ! This is stupid !
 I don 't have to prove anything .
 I 'm gonna go get them .
 But then everyone will know .
 Unless I get them , and then wake up really early and put them back .
 I need help !
