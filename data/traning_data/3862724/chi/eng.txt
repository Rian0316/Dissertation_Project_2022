 00 : 00 : 01, 716 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 317 Leonard , I 've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley .
 Oh , I like to laugh .
 But say it anyway .
 Okay , um ...
 What do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department ?
 I 'll have fries with that . ( chuckles )

 Because his education hasn 't prepared him for a career in the sciences .
 You know , when they chase you out of there , you only have to run faster than Sheldon .
 Are you all set for your trip ?
 Yeah , I think so .
 I just restocked the old PRK .
 " PRK " ?
 Public restroom kit .
 Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places .
 I don 't see what 's crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell .
 Keep going .
 And rubber gloves , uh , air freshener .
 Um , noise- cancelling headphones .
 Oh , danger whistle .
 Um ... pepper spray .
 Ooh , a multi- language " occupied " sign .
 Uh , let 's see .
 We have seat protectors , uh , booties for my shoes , a clothespin for my nose .
 Oh , and a mirror on a stick , so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn 't some kind of weirdo .
 You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away ?
 Yes , who do you think gave him the danger whistle ?

 Original Air Date on April 2 , 2015

 Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called " I Can 't Spy " ?
 It 's all the nail- biting tension of " I Spy " but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum .
 If it 's half as much fun as
 " One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall , "
 I 'm in .
 I 'll begin .
 Uh , I can 't spy with my little eye ... ... something passing right through us .
 That soy Frappuccino I had .
 ( chuckles )
 Will you please play the game ?
 I can 't spy with my little eye something passing right through us .
 I don 't know , um ...
 If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimeter every second , given the surface area of this car is about 60, 000 square centimeters , that means 3 . 9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos ?


 I don 't want to play anymore .
 We haven 't been on a road trip in a while .
 This is fun .
 We get it -- you won the game .
 Stop bragging .
 No , listen , we wrote a paper together .
 Now we get to go to a university and talk about it ?
 That 's pretty cool .
 I suppose it is .
 In fact , if you 'd like to celebrate with a little music ,
 I 'd be okay with that .
 What ... ?
 This road trip just got crazy .
 Play that funky music , white boy .
 I 'm surprised you know that reference .
 What reference ?
 So , I put stickers on everything we 're gonna sell .
 We just need help taking it all out to the driveway .
 Can I be in charge of pricing ?
 I 've been going to garage sales my whole life .
 Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel ?
 All right , Amy 's in charge of pricing and being 75 .
 Hey , Penny , can you give me a hand with this ?
 Sure .
 Aw , we had one of these growing up .
 I used to play all the time .
 Oh , yeah ?
 I love Ping- Pong .
 Oh , I meant beer pong .

 I had a table , too , but I didn 't have any friends , so all I did was serve .
 You know , you can leave one side up and play against it .
 And if I had a friend , they might have told me that .
 Excuse me .
 Why is there a sticker on this ?
 It 's my TARDlS from
 I was planning on moving it in the house .
 I think you just answered your own question .
 Come on , one day , this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it .
 Sweetie , we have a lot to do .
 We don 't need to decide this right now .
 Well , I guess as long as you 're keeping an open mind .
 Of course .
 ♪ ♪
 So ... they 're requesting that the white boy play the funky music , yes ?
 Yes .
 And this music we 're listening to right now is funky as well ?
 Sure .
 Let me ask you this .
 Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays ?
 It could be .
 So it 's like the musical equivalent of Russell 's Paradox , the question of whether the set of all sets that don 't contain themselves as members contains itself ?
 Exactly .
 Well ... then I hate it .
 Music should just be fun .
 ( music stops )
 Making great time .
 Gonna be there pretty early .
 Will our hotel room be ready ?
 I doubt it .
 Aren 't you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective ?
 If we do , we 'll just tell him to " hit the bricks , see ? "
 Seems a little confrontational , but all right .
 You know , we won 't be very far from Skywalker Ranch .
 Oh , that 's true .
 It 's not like we can get in there .
 Why not ?
 I- I don 't think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in .

 Yoda 's swamp was in the middle of nowhere .

 Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere .
 Hoth was in the middle of nowhere .

 That 's code , Leonard .
 He wants us to drop in .
 We do have time .
 I mean , we could drive by and just look at it .
 Yes !
 Oh ...
 I 'm so excited .
 And I just can 't hide it .
 " I 'm about to lose control , and I think I like it . "

 What are you talking about ?
 So when do you guys think you 're gonna move in ?
 We 're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do .
 It 's tricky finding the right balance between " tasteful modern " and " Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest . "
 Have you made a decision about the TARDlS ?
 I think I can sell it if we call it , " Big British Porta- Potty . "
 We 're not selling it -- it 's mine .
 You can 't just decide .
 How about I arm- wrestle you ?
 That 's not fair .
 It 's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest .
 You could play Ping- Pong for it .
 I would do that .
 How is that fair ?
 You grew up with a table .
 Yes , but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods .
 Bernadette , for every episode of
 Leonard has made me sit through ,
 I will play on your behalf and send that TARDlS back to Gallifrey , where I hate that I know it belongs .


 Yes , Penny plays for me .
 That 's not fair -- she has upper body muscles .
 Dude , three- time Sanskriti School for Well- Born Boys badminton champion .
 That 's right -- okay , Raj can play for me .
 Ooh , you just chose champions .
 It 's like we 're reenacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat .
 PENNY :
 Yeah , it 's also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in
 Leonard makes you watch that , too ?
 No , no , I like that show .
 It 's got dragons and people doing it .
 WOLOWlTZ : So it 's settled .
 The fate of Doctor Who 's TARDlS will be decided by a inspired death- match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers .
 If you still have that bra , I 'll give you a nickel for it .
 There it is .
 It 's just a gate .
 On a road .
 Wasn 't even that hard to find .
 This is so amazing !
 I know !
 You want to get a picture ?
 I want more than a picture .
 I want to go in .
 Well , so do I , but they 'll never let us .
 Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny ?
 No , but I don 't have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me .
 Uh , there 's a speaker box .
 Drive up , push the button , and let 's see what happens .
 Okay , yeah .
 What do we have to lose ?
 I 'm a little nervous .
 Well , get over it .
 Confidence is key in these situations .
 Right .
 ( gasps ) You pushed it -- are you out of your mind ? !
 MAN :
 May I help you ?
 Um ...
 Uh , uh ... we don 't have an appointment , and- and we don 't belong here , but we- we 're , like , crazy- big fans .
 I mean ... ( stammers )
 " crazy for crazy , not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape , although we do have a backpack that you really don 't want to look in .

 You 're blowing it .
 We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him !
 Hello ?
 This speaker 's not working , just pull up .
 And that 's how it 's done .
 All right , we 've defeated the first challenge .
 Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate .
 We 're trying to get past a security guard , not rescue Zelda .

 I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy , but one quest at a time .
 So what 's the plan ?
 Uh , I 'm just gonna be honest with the guy .
 Honesty will never get us in .
 Well , what 's your plan ?
 All right , my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse 's office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed .
 Who are you here to see ?
 Uh , I 'm just gonna tell you the truth .
 Oh , you are killing me .
 We don 't have an appointment .
 We- we 're just fans of Mr. Lucas 's work , and we thought we 'd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around .

 Sorry , guys , we get this a lot .
 Can 't let you in .
 What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda ?
 ( imitating Yoda ) : A recording session I must attend .
 I 'm sorry , don 't listen to him .
 We 're actually physicists .
 We 're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today .
 We just ... we had some time to kill .
 GUARD : Hey , listen , you seem like decent guys .
 I can 't let you in , but I got some hats and T- shirts I can give you .
 Thank you so much .
 See ?
 Maybe honesty is the best ... ( door opens )
 What are you doing ?
 Shedding the yoke of my oppressors , you blind , sad little man .
 Don 't move !
 Code A- A- 23 , A- A- 23 .
 GUARD 2 : Copy .
 SHELDON ( gasps ) :
 I can see the ranch , Leonard !
 Oh , it 's rustic , it 's lovely .
 I 'd take a picture , but people are chasing me .
 I 'm gonna make it ... !
 I 'm gonna make it !
 They have Tasers , but they wouldn 't dare use ... ( Sheldon screams ) ( thuds )
 Come on , Raj .
 You are the King Kong of Ping- Pong .
 You are the menace of table tennis .
 Put her away , ' cause I don 't have a third one .
 Yes !
 Yes !
 ( whoops )
 Rajesh eight , Penny four .
 Sorry , he 's really good .
 Hey , Raj . if Howard can 't keep the TARDlS , how great would it look at your place ?
 What ?
 Yeah , what ?
 I don 't know much about but if , um , you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back , it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDlS , which is pretty cool



 ' cause on the show , the inside of the TARDlS is bigger than the outside .
 But then again , I don 't know much about
 Don 't listen to her .
 You and I go way back -- we 're like brothers .
 We are .
 We are .
 ( clears throat )
 Oh , no !
 What a terrible serve !
 Sorry , brother .
 Eight- five .
 This is ridiculous .
 I want a new champion .
 Amy , were you serious about being able to serve ?
 Uh , it- it 's been a long time .
 I don 't know .
 I 'm probably pretty rusty .
 Wow .
 She 's my champion !
 Well , if you can switch champions , so can I.
 I want Raj .
 Hey .
 Oh , come on , like you even care .
 I care !
 Oh , wait , no , I don 't .
 Good luck , Raj .
 You know , I thought our friendship meant more to you .
 So did I.
 Do you think they 're gonna call the police ?
 I don 't know .
 Maybe they 'll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star .
 Oh , I think that 's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer .
 Stormtroopers are really the ones who ...
 Oh , shut up .
 He 's right .
 Uh , Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police .
 Uh- huh , I 'm normally very nice , but you shut up , too .
 So ... what are you in for ?
 Honestly , I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you .
 You know , growing up , the movies had such an impact on my life .
 I never really fit in anywhere .
 Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong .
 But why are you here ?
 Oh , I , uh , I hopped a fence , and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue .

 Excuse me .
 Leonard , they have a sculpture gallery .
 All right , I talked to my supervisor , and we 're gonna let you go with a warning .
 ( sighs in relief ) But if you ever come back , we will call the police and press charges .
 We understand .
 Thank you so much .
 Uh , what about me ?
 No , you 're not going anywhere , kissy face .
 Let 's go .
 I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate .
 Uh , one question about that picture .
 Can it be with George Lucas ?
 ( imitating Yoda ) : Ooh , grumpy you are .
 Okay , this is the match that decides it all .
 First to 11 wins .
 Serve switches every five points .
 And just so you know , when this started ,
 I was going to put the TARDlS in a discreet corner of the house , but I 've since turned mean , and now it 's going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says " suck it . "

 Game on .
 Except ...
 Raj is gonna win .
 Isn 't that right , Raj ?
 Uh , yeah , I mean , her serve was pretty good .
 Come on , get in her head .
 Be intimidating .
 Okay , uh ...
 I 'm gonna own you , bitch !
 Whoa !
 Hey !
 That 's not nice .
 Let 's just play .
 One- zero .
 WOLOWlTZ : Two .
 Three .
 Four .
 Five- nothing .
 ( chuckles ) Wait , did you play badminton or sad- minton ?
 Don 't listen to him -- all she 's got is a serve .
 Now , grab a fresh tampon and put her away .
 Wha ... ?
 A- And that 's not offensive ?
 Where 's the line ?
 It 's in your purse . Play .


 BERNADETTE : One- five .
 Two- five .
 Three- five .
 Four- five .
 Five- five !
 Six .
 Seven .
 Eight .
 Nine .
 Ten- five !
 Six .
 Seven .
 Eight .
 Nine .
 Ten- ten !
 Well , that was an exciting 40 seconds .
 It was , and now the serve is back to you , and the game is over .
 You know , Amy , I , uh ... can 't help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDlS was at your place .

 Don 't listen to her , just hit the ball .
 Keep talking .
 If this doesn 't get him into your bedroom , nothing will .
 Are you still mad at me ?
 Yes , we missed our lecture , we were almost arrested , and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee .
 Boy , some people are just glass- half- empty .
 The glass is empty , Sheldon .
 It 's completely empty .
 If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst , he would be dead , do you know why ?
 Before I answer , was he a smoker ?
 I think you 're looking at this all wrong .
 Fine , then tell me how I should be looking at it .
 Well , not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch , we got in .
 No one we know can say that .
 And for all the times you find me irritating , today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser .
 That part was pretty good .
 See ?
 You did flop around a lot .
 I 'll take your word for it .
 I was too busy trying not to defecate .
 You know , when they were escorting us to the detaining room , I looked through a door , and I 'm pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant .


 That 's amazing . ( chuckling ) :
 I know .
 And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle .

 Although that was right after the Tasing , so who can say for sure ?
 I- I guess this could count as an adventure .
 It was .
 And even though we 're not allowed back there , they can never take today away from us .
 Unlike my sense of smell , which hasn 't returned since the Tasing .
 ( sniffs )
 No , I got nothing .
 ( panting ) : Amy , the Daleks are right on my tail !


 Quick , we need to reset the time circuits .
 Oh , no , I left my sonic screwdriver behind .
 Really should have thought this through .
