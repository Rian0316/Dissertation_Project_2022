 00 : 00 : 41, 539 -- > 00 : 00 : 43, 299 Cranford 's giving you a look .
 There .
 Go and have a look .
 Go and have a look .
 I don 't know why . I saved a cow of his last week .

 Poor thing had colic .
 Sorry , ladies and gentlemen .
 It says eight o 'clock on there .
 Quite exciting .


 Hello !
 Hello .
 Thank you .
 And then a gasp of amazement and satisfaction runs around the world .

 The Prime Minister decides to fly to a personal meeting with the German Chancellor , so after 69 years of a busy life ,

 Mr Chamberlain makes his first trip in a plane .

 There 's proof of his determination .

 The German Chancellor regards the situation , it seems to me , to be one in which discussions between him and me



 It 'll get sorted . .. may have useful consequences .

 Are your parents still coming down to see you ?
 The day after tomorrow .
 They can only stay the one night .

 Hello .
 She 's dead .

 Dead ?

 Aye , she is .
 Dead .
 Not her !

 Me cow , you silly beggar !
 I am sorry about that .

 And I don 't think it was owt to do with her stomach , neither .

 Sorry .

 And ...
 And here 's another thing , you never sent me that salve you promised me either .

 What do you think ?
 That it 's beyond saving .

 I thought I 'd get in for your parents .
 They 're still stopping by tomorrow ?
 Is there any more mustard ?

 You 've got legs .

 They 're welcome to stay , you know .
 It 's no bother making up another bed .
 They 've got the inn booked .
 They didn 't want to impose .

 Has your mum got any idea you 're not coming back ?

 I didn 't want to do it over the phone .
 With everything else going on in the world , maybe she 'll mind less .

 What 's this ?

 Oh , just ... looking to the future , making decisions .

 I 'm still thinking about it .
 You 're a good vet . There 's only one exam .
 I can help you revise if you like .

 Aw . My gallant crew , good morning !

 An enjoyable evening with Diana ?
 Mind your beeswax !
 Oh , God , man , you smell like a tart 's handbag !
 Parma Violet , if I 'm not mistaken .
 I wondered where my bath salts had gone !

 Oh , he had a rough time of it last night .
 Oh , aye . I was at the cinema with Helen ...
 I 'll get it . .. but Cranford wouldn 't stop going on about some bloody salve .

 I 'll do it .
 It would have been nice to have one night out with Helen that didn 't end in disaster .

 When are you going to stop this nonsense and get wed ?

 Why are you laughing ?

 You 're not serious , are you ?
 But I 've no money , no house .
 Where would we live ?
 Here , of course . With Tristan sleeping in the cupboard ?

 I wouldn 't mind waking up to Helen ...
 Sorry , that 's inappropriate !
 But it 's true . Gather ye rosebuds while ye may , Old Time is still a- flying ;

 And this same flower that smiles today , tomorrow will be dying .

 I 'm not getting married !
 You 're getting married ? !
 I 'm not ! Caution - often a virtue , but you carry it too far .

 You need to take a chance , lash out a little .

 Carpe some diem !
 Throw off these hesitant ways and , remember , there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood ...



 Yes , Siegfried , all right , all right .

 Stop it .
 Who was on the phone ?
 Mrs Dalby . She wants you to look over her stirks .

 Why aren 't you off to school yet ?
 I just wanted to see about the cows .
 Billy Francis Dalby , if you 're not on your bike this second ...

 Mum !
 You must be proud of him .
 Oh , I am that .
 Now , I know you told me not to put them out again , but we worked through the hay so fast ,

 I couldn 't afford to keep feeding them cake .
 I can see they 've been suffering with diarrhoea . Yeah .
 It seems to have happened within a few days .

 Maybe it 's something they 've eaten .

 You have any idea what it might be ?
 There 's a few possibilities .

 The most troubling is it could be salmonella .
 Right .
 Let 's wait until we know before we start worrying .

 I 'll take some samples , get them analysed , and by tomorrow , we 'll know what we 're dealing with .

 I sometimes wonder ... .. maybe we 'd be better off if I 'd just listened to you and sold up whilst we still had the chance .



 You kept the farm for Billy , to give him hope , a future .

 Oh , we spent all that money on cake as well .

 We need to wait for the results and then we 'll deal with it .

 So let 's stop all this talk about moving on .
 Your life is here .
 This is where you belong .

 Thanks , James .
 Don 't forget to stop by the house for a brew .
 Well , you see here , Mr Thomas , what I 'm saying is they call themselves vets , and they 're all right with cattle and that class of thing , but they 're no use with cats and dogs , you mark my words .





 What you need is some of my shampoos .
 Oh , that will see him right as rain in a minute , won 't it , Rex ?

 Won 't it , my sweetheart ?
 You 're starting early .

 Do I detect a note of judgment in your tone , Maggie ?

 Far be it from me .
 Oh , wheesht , Rex .
 You 'll give yourself a sore throat .
 Rex !
 Come here , Rex !

 Rex !
 He came out of nowhere !

 It 's all right .
 I 'll take care of him .

 What are you doing ? !
 Poor thing !
 Come on , now .
 Come on , now .

 He needs a vet , Mrs Donovan .
 Rex ...
 My boy !

 I 've no doubt Mrs Donovan 's shampoos are marvellous for cleaning a dog 's fur , but they 'll do nothing to mend a broken hip .

 If you 'd like to wait , Mr Thomas , then I 'm sure Mr Farnon will be with you in a minute . Thank you .

 Siegfried , hit by a car .
 Hold on !
 Hold on !
 What are you going to do to him ?

 Mrs Donovan , perhaps you should wait in the living room .
 I am not leaving my dog !

 What happened exactly ?

 Oh , he bolted and then a car came .
 Chloroform . There 's no need .

 Has he gone ?

 No , he hasn 't !
 That 's my dog !
 Massive internal haemorrhaging , I think .

 I can feel damage to the pelvic bone .

 Nothing we could have done .
 I 'm so sorry , Mrs Donovan .
 Hi , James .
 How are you doing , Jenny ?
 Hello .
 Hello .
 What is it ?
 Oh , nothing . There was just some pollen in the air .

 That 's it , Candy .
 Good girl . Jenny , you 're not jinking off school , are you ?

 I said she could .
 She don 't want to miss the birth .
 It 's all Pythagoras and his blooming triangles anyway .

 How 's that supposed to help me milk the cows ?
 Speaking of which , you might make yourself useful .
 I 'll leave you pair to it .

 I was always trying to skip school at her age . Really ?
 I always had you down as a bit of a goody- two- shoes .
 I 'll try not to take offence at that .
 Shall we have a look at you , then , Candy , to see how your foal 's doing ?
 Many more calls today ?
 You 're my last . I 've got to get a sample from the Dalbys over to Harrogate .

 It could be salmonella .
 Oh , that 's the last thing Phyilis needs .
 When will you get the results ?
 Should be a day .
 It 's a fair drive .
 If you 're able to get away , it 'd be nice to have some company .
 There 's a few things I need to finish on the farm first .
 I 'm happy to wait .

 I thought we could have dinner with my folks tomorrow .

 Together ?
 All of us ? Well , I 'd like to introduce you to them since you are ...

 Well , we are ... you know .

 And I met your dad .
 I even wore his shoes . Right .
 I must check I 've got a clean frock , then .
 Do you think he suffered at all ?
 I 'm certain he didn 't .



 You can leave him here if you 'd prefer .
 Oh , no .
 My Rex will have a proper burial .


 There 's a spot down by my boat ... .. under a tree .
 He used to like it .
 Sounds perfect .


 Shall I carry him over for you ?

 Aye , well ...

 I suppose that 's all right , then .


 Did you have him long ?
 Eight years all in .
 He must have seen a lot of the world with you .
 I 'm sure he had a wonderful life .
 What would you know about our life ?
 No , no , I 'm not saying I do , I just imagine .
 Whenever I saw him out and about with you , he always looked happy .
 You know where you are with a dog .
 They 're loyal .
 They don 't judge you for who or what you are .
 What is it you 're after ?
 Cos I 'm telling you , if it 's money , you 'll get none for me .
 I 'm not after anything . Right . Well , why are you doing this , then ?

 Sure , you hardly know me .
 I saw what happened to your dog and I wanted to help him .
 And I suppose , deep down , it also means I wanted to help you too .

 It 's not just the animals .

 Are you soft in the head ?
 What are you on about ?
 It doesn 't matter .
 Something somebody said to me once .
 More than once .
 You 're a funny man .

 Did anyone ever tell you that ?
 More often than I care to mention .
 Well , you might take it as a compliment .
 There 's room enough in this world for folks of all kinds of different stripes .



 Who 's that fella ?
 You 're all right , he 's with me .


 That 's my boat .

 And my lamb there . My Rex is dead .

 He felt nothing .





 You wains can help me lay him to rest .


 How old were your parents when they got married ?
 Dad said he were barely out of short trousers when he asked me mam .
 I don 't know my parents got engaged . Never thought to ask .

 No . You never struck me as the romantic type .
 I am romantic !
 Oh , no , I didn 't mean it in a bad way .
 I just meant you 're not one for grand gestures or anything too extravagant .
 I like that about you .
 My mum thinks if I stay in this job , I 'll never find a wife .
 And Siegfried thinks I should just get on and marry you !
 Oh ! What did you say ?
 I laughed .
 He said I 'd a habit of being too cautious , that I don 't have the courage of my convictions and see dangers where there are none .





 That 's how Siegfried put it anyway .




 You know , there 's something in what Siegfried said .
 In what way ? Well , you do sometimes overthink , see catastrophe round every corner .



 It 's not something I want to do . Then don 't . Don 't ?
 Overthink .
 Worry less .
 I wish I could . Well , you can .
 I can ?
 Why not ?
 Just decide to be positive and take the plunge ?
 What 's the worst that could happen ?
 You 'd say no ! To what ?
 Asking you to marry me .




 Stop the car .


 Helen , I 'm fine with you not being ready .
 I just ...
 I just need a moment .




 But I 'm not afraid to say it .


 Say what ?
 I want to spend the rest of my life with you .
 Here in the Dales . I 'm not afraid either .



 You 're not ?

 No .


 James , why do you smell like that ?
 I ran out of bath salts so I used Mrs Hall 's .

 I may have overdone it somewhat . What ? Is it the smell ?
 Don 't worry , it 'll be gone in a couple of days .

 It 's not the smell .
 The ring ?
 I haven 't got a ring ! You see , this is the problem with not planning !
 It 's Dad .
 I take it you haven 't spoke to him ?





 Look Dad in the eye .
 And don 't gabble .
 Sometimes when you 're nervous , you gabble . What do you mean , I gabble ?

 I don 't gabble .
 When have I ever ... I hardly ever .
 Unless I 'm really nervous maybe .
 Right .

 Something 's wrong .



 I would have sent for Mr Farnon .
 There 's summat up with our Candy . Come quick , will you ?




 The uterus is twisted .
 And that 's bad , is it ?

 Give me a hand .


 Now , when it 's open like this , you can put your hand straight through .
 But if I twist it ...
 Nothing can get through .
 That 's what 's happening inside Candy .
 And we need to unwind it .

 If you can 't ? We 'll lose them both , love .




 Jenny , go up to the phone box and call Skeldale House .

 We 're going to need some help .


 Oh .


 Darrowby 2- 2- 9- 7 .
 Oh , Jenny , hello , how are you ?
 Mr Farnon ?

 He 's just coming , love .
 Jenny Alderson .


 Jenny ?


 I 'll be out there straight away .
 I 'll get your jacket .
 Is something going on ?

 Problem with the Aldersons ' horse .
 James needs my help .


 Hold that .


 Thank you .


 This morning , I had another talk with the German Chancellor , Herr Hitler . Here is the paper ...

 Hello , you . .. which bears his name upon it as well as mine .
 Good book ?

 Mm .



 Some of you perhaps have already heard what it contains ... .. but I would just like to read it to you .
 .. the British Minister have had a further meeting today ...
 Siegfried !
 Wait ! .. and are agreed in recognising that the question of Anglo- German relations is of the first importance for the two countries and for Europe .






 We regard the agreement signed last night and at the Anglo- German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again .





 Good evening , Richard , Helen , Jenny .
 What 's the presentation ?
 Uterus is still twisted . It 's too late to carry out a caesarean .
 Don 't worry , the cavalry 's here .
 So you 're going to try to turn her over to unwind it ?
 That 's the plan . I 'll take hold of the hooves .

 Siegfried , Mr Alderson , when I say , roll the horse over .
 Hopefully it 'll untwist the uterus around the foal .
 Tris , give them a hand if they need it .
 Jenny , love ... I 'm staying .

 Ready ? Come on , then .


 It 's all right .
 Candy was their mother 's horse .

 It 'll put everything right .




 I 've got hold of the feet .
 All right .
 Now , roll her .

 Stop , stop , hold on .

 I 'm losing grip of the foal 's hooves .


 All right .
 I 've got them . Ready ? Go .
 Is it working ?
 Yeah , I can feel it loosening .







 It 's coming towards me .
 The foal 's coming . It 's coming . It 's coming !




 It 's coming .



 He 's done it !
 It 's out !



 Oh .
 Evening .
 Thought we 'd drop by and see if you fancied a stroll ?


 Let me grab my coat . Come here .




 Go one . Aw !
 Go on . Go on . Aw ! One more , one more .

 Come on , little one .

 Go on , little one .

 Yay !
 There we are .





 Our work here is done .


 I 'll call her Joan .
 After mum .



 Aye , that 'll do .
 We 'll , um , leave 'em be .

 Mother knows what 's best for 'em .


 Jenny ...
 Jenny .
 But ...





 Must be going bloomin ' soft .
 She 's , er ... She 's a good girl , is Candy .



 Mr Alderson ... .. I 'd like to marry your daughter .

 Right .
 You better come up to t 'house , lad .


 It 's been good weather for t 'hay .
 Aye , it is .
 That 's true .




 Drop of rain won 't do any ill , mind .
 Oh , definitely .
 Definitely , just to ... moisten it .





 No , I 'm fine .
 Actually ...
 Thank you .





 I had a wife in a thousand .
 I 've heard a lot about her .
 She certainly sounds it .
 Nobody thought she 'd settle for a fella like me .
 You know ?

 But she did .
 One in a thousand , she were .
 Bit bloody stubborn , though , she set her mind to it .



 I ...
 All right , why not ?

 You know , I can 't ...
 I can 't picture her face the way that I used to .
 Time passes .
 But I see it in them girls of mine , I see it in our Jenny .

 She has that look when she gets cross , and our Helen has her smile .
 I see it sometimes when I catch her looking at you .


 Aye . Mr Alderson , I love Helen .

 I 'll take care of her . I doubt that .

 She 'll be t 'one taking care of you , lad . With your permission .

 What for ?
 You 've already asked her , haven 't you ?
 I did .
 I have .
 How did you know ? I told you .

 That smile , her mother 's smile .


 Listen .
 There 's no point asking me for my permission , lad .
 That lass does exactly as she chooses .
 Like her mother . Stubborn .






 That were Helen 's mother 's .
 My Joan .
 Might you use it ?





 I 'd be honoured .
 Thank you . Aye .
 Good lad .




 Leftover stool samples .
 Unlike James not to have cleaned them out .
 Lovely .
 Where is he , by the way ?
 Shouldn 't he be up by now ?
 Didn 't get back from the Aldersons until late last night .
 I know you want the salve , Mr Cranford .
 But we are not a delivery service .
 If you 'd like to come by ...
 Get that bloody salve sent over !
 Rude man !

 Cranford ?

 Need you ask ?
 I 'll drop the salve round for him later .


 Oh , there you are James . What time do you call this ?

 Sorry , Siegfried . Late night .
 I got waylaid at the Aldersons . Ha- ha , really ?
 Talking to Richard .
 Oh , Richard now , is it ?
 Asking his permission to marry Helen !



 Oh , my goodness ! Congratulations !


 Let me give you a kiss .

 Well , hang on , she hasn 't said yes yet .
 She has !
 James , well done !

 I got the order of things a little muddled up .
 I 've got you to thank for that , Siegfried .
 Yes , well , you took your time about it .
 Mr Farnon .
 What ?
 Oh , all right . Well done .
 Yes , very good , very moving .
 Drinks later to celebrate ?

 Let 's see how dinner with my parents goes first . Are you bringing Helen ?



 Oh , they 're going to be so pleased .




 Another busy day ?
 A list far too long and varied to encapsulate in a few brief words .
 He said he had to come to it himself .
 Oh , rubbish .
 What happened to doing as you 're damn well told ? Go on .
 You better be off to meet your parents .
 Hold on .
 I had a phone call from a lab in Harrogate .
 They said they didn 't find anything .
 Why are you smiling ?
 Is that a good thing ?
 Aye . It is .








 There you are .
 Come on , then .
 What 's this ?
 Come on .
 Good boy .



 Good boy !
 Come on , then , you .

 Come on .
 That 's it .
 Good boy !








 There 's my boy !
 Give your ma a kiss .
 Let me take that for you , Dad .
 Thank you , son .
 We 'll drop your things at the inn , and then we 'll go for a drive .

 Where to ?
 You 'll see .
 On a beautiful day like this , you can see for 20 miles .
 But when the weather comes in , it 's a brutal place .
 Snow ten foot deep , fog so thick you can barely see your hand in front of your face .
 I don 't like the thought of you going out in weather like that .
 Thank goodness you won 't have to do this much longer .
 It 's not so bad .
 Slipping off in the dead of night ?

 Not coming home until morning ?
 You 'll never find a wife carrying on like that , you know .

 It 's unnatural .
 And those grandkiddies don 't make themselves , you know .

 Good to see you , Dad .
 Pick the leaves like these , and don 't be pulling up the meadowsweet , cos it needs leaf to bloom .
 Right .
 Look miserable .

 Hello , Mrs Donovan .






 What 's up with this one , then ?
 He 's a stray .
 Where are you taking him ?
 Well , with no home to go to , there 's really only one option .

 We 'll have to put him down . Got no- one to take care of him .

 No- one 's going to want a dog in this state . Give him to me .

 I 'll have him .
 Really , he should be checked over by a qualified vet .
 Oh , I 'll take care of him , never you worry .



 He might benefit from those shampoos of yours .



 Maybe he 's not as daft as he looks .
 Come on , down you get .
 That 's it .
 Why on earth have you brought us here ?
 I 've got a few jobs to get through this afternoon .

 I 'm sorry .
 It won 't take long .
 All right there , Jim ?

 Afternoon , Phyilis .
 These are my parents , Hannah and James . Hello .

 Afternoon . Hello .
 What we saying then , Jim ?
 Don 't keep us waiting . Thankfully , it 's not salmonella .
 In fact , the laboratory couldn 't find anything wrong with them . Oh .


 There must be a mistake , because I can see how bad they are , and they 're getting worse by the day .

 There 's something I want to show you .
 Come on .
 Why don 't we take a look ?

 Come on ! Oh ...




 Oh !
 See this light colouration around the eyes ?

 It 's like they 've got spectacles .

 Aye , that 's right , Billy . Well spotted .
 I noticed it last time I was here , but I wanted to rule out everything else to confirm the diagnosis .

 So , what is it ?
 They 're suffering from copper deficiency .
 You can tell by the loss of pigment in the coat - particularly around the eyes .



 I take it by the smug look on your face you know how to fix it .
 Certainly , I do .
 A simple solution given orally .
 It 'll have to be repeated , to make sure they don 't get deficient again .
 Other than that , they 'll have a long and happy life .
 And it is very expensive ?
 Cheap as chips . Yes !
 We mix it , and you administer it yourself .
 I 'll have some ready for you to pick up tomorrow .

 Good God , Jim , don 't do that to me .

 I thought for a minute there we were beaten .
 I don 't think you 'd ever be that , Phyilis .

 Well , better get back . Mm- hm . Get tea ready for the brood .

 Yeah . Thanks , James . Cheerio .
 Nice to meet you .
 See ?
 Told you everything would be all right .
 Yes , we made it .
 It 's beautiful up here , isn 't it ?



 Aye , it is .
 I 'll drop you at the end to freshen up .
 Where are you gallivanting off to now ?
 I 'm bringing someone to dinner I 'd like you to meet .







 I want to say ... .. that the settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem ... .. which has now been achieved ... .. is in my view only the prelude ... .. to a larger settlement ... in which all Europe may find peace .









 Careful , you 'll get messed up .
 James ' parents have us down as a right bunch of scruff- backs .
 Yeah , well , they need taking in .
 Otherwise they 'll be roosting all over the place .
 Give him here .
 Give him here !
 Ready to go ?
 Erm , I 'm just going to see if Deb needs help with anything first .
 Don 't worry .
 They 're going to love you . Hm ...

 Is that ... ?
 Looks like something on the back of your dress .










 You said I couldn 't do romantic gestures .
 Get up , you daft beggar .


 Is that ... ?

 Is that me mum 's ?
 It is .






 James will be back soon .
 Drink , anyone ?
 Whisky perhaps ?
 God , yes !
 We won 't actually .
 We 're not big drinkers .
 No , neither are we .
 Special occasions .







 It 's a fine place you have here , Mr Farnon .
 James can 't speak highly enough about it .

 Ah .
 You must be sorry to be losing him .
 What ?
 What are you talking about ?

 Oh , no , me and my big mouth .

 Did you not know ?
 Hello !

 Sorry that took a while . No trouble at all , son .

 Mr Farnon 's been keeping us entertained .
 We were just talking about how sorry he 'll be to see you gone .


 Yes , something of a shock .
 No doubt we 'll find a replacement easily enough .

 Siegfried . Who 's this ?

 Aren 't you going to introduce us ? Erm , right .

 Mum , Dad , this is Helen ... .. my fiancee .






 Hello .
 How do you do ?
 It 's lovely to meet you both .


 Tristan , would you like to come and set the table for dinner ?
 Why don 't I give you a hand ?



 Once you 're married , we 'll see if we can 't squeeze a bigger bed into James ' room .

 Oh , should be able to manage that .
 It 'll be a busy house , but I 'm sure we 'll all rub along just fine .

 Mum , I want you to know this hasn 't been easy , but ...



 What ? What hasn 't been easy ?



 I should 've told you sooner , but the truth is I didn 't fully know for a long time .

 I 'm staying here , and it 's not only because of Helen .
 What about the job ?
 I was tempted , I won 't lie .

 But thinking about it 's made me realise all the more how much I love it here .

 Every day is different .
 I wake up and I have no idea where the job will take me .
 I could be up in the High Dales wrestling cattle or helping a dog that 's had its paw caught in a trap .

 It 's this place , those hills ...

 James is too modest to ever say this himself , but he 's made such a difference to so , so many people since he arrived .



 It 's especially true for me and my family , and so many others .
 That farm you visited today , the Dalbys , that 's the second time he 's saved their herd this year .
 What he does here really matters .
 Oh , but Bill 's place ...
 You can work normal hours , it 's so modern and new .
 That 's not what makes a practice .
 It 's the people .


 I love this place .


 It 's my home now .


 You should be so proud of him .
 I certainly am .
 And I love him with all my heart .


 So long as you 're both happy .
 That 's all we 've ever wanted for you .



 Aye , it 's true .






 I wish we could convince you to stay another night .
 No , we need to get back and see about gaining some work .
 I 'll be back up to visit you as soon as I can .
 Christmas maybe .
 Visit ?
 You don 't visit your home .
 It 's your real home , and it always will be . I know , Mum .

 I didn 't mean that .
 You 're my boy .

 Bye , son .
 You 've made a nice little life for yourself down here .

 Thanks , Dad .


 Look after him for us .
 I will .





 Bye . Bye , love .



 Right , let 's get you in that bus .






 I love you .
 I love you , too .
 Oi !
 There you are !
 Hey , I 'll have a word with you !

 It 's about that ... .. that damn ... .. salve you sent me !




 To peace !
 To Mr Chamberlain !
 Mr Chamberlain ! Good man .

 Isn 't it something ?
 You don 't realise how much something weighs on you till it 's gone .
 I know exactly what you mean .
 Now , look here , I think it grossly unfair of you to characterise my support as something akin to the trials of Atlas .

 I only push you because I know you could achieve so much more than you do , and if I didn 't push you , then you damn well wouldn 't do anything useful ...



 Here ! Here he is ! What do you think of this one , then ?

 I cleaned the foots , and all it took was some of my shampoos .

 I named him Roy .

 And to think you were going to do away with him .
 You were right , Mrs Donovan .
 Your shampoos really seem to have done the trick .
 Come here , you .


 You needn 't think I don 't know what you were up to .



 Come on , Roy . Come on , son .



 How is everything ? Can I get you anything else ? Any more drinks ?

 There was a stray moping about the place .

 I wanted to see if I could do something for him and help Mrs Donovan at the same time .
 That sounds very kind of you .
 Sorry , Siegfried , you were saying something about me never doing anything useful .
 I take it back .
 Now you 're going to have to give me some money .
 Oh , I just bought you a drink .
 Don 't tell me you 've guzzled it already . So I can go back to college .

 I 've decided to re- sit parasitology .

 I think veterinary practice might be my calling after all .

 Tristan , is it possible that you got Cranford 's salve mixed up with a stool sample ?


 Just bumped into him outside the Vulcan Inn .

 Said he started to rub it in before he realised . No- one gets to be rude to Mrs H.

 Quite right , well played .

 Good boy .
 Siegfried , I know I should 've told you about the job sooner , but I meant what I said .
 I 've learnt so much from you .

 Yes , well , I couldn 't help noticing that both of you took rather a long time fully to appreciate ...

 Oh , be quiet .
 Hear , you pair ... .. to your engagement and a very happy future together .

 Hear .
 Thank you .

 Cheers !



 So , Helen , do you think you 'll be able to go through with it this time ?

 Tris !
 What , I 'm only saying what we 're all thinking .
 Ow !
