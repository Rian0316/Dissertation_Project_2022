 Fellow warriors ,
 This is sheldor the conqueror . We are about to enter axidus ' fortress .
 Now , this is a long run , so let 's do another bladder check .
 All right , barry , we 'll wait for you again ,
 But you really should see a doctor .
 Sheldor is afk .
 Penny , are you experiencing some sort of difficulty ? Yes . I can 't get my stupid door open .
 You appear to have put your car key
 In the door lock -- are you aware of that ? Yeah .
 All right , then .
 Damn it ,
 Damn it , damn it , damn it , damn it ! Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly ?
 I can 't get the damn key out .
 Well , it 's not surprising -- that baldwin lock on your door
 Uses traditional edge- mounted cylinders , Whereas the key for your volkswagen
 Uses a center cylinder system .
 Thank you , sheldon .
 You 're welcome .
 Why did you put
 Your car key in the door lock ? Why ? I 'll tell you why -- because today I had an audition ,
 It took me two hours to get there ,
 I waited an hour for my turn , And before I could even start ,
 They told me I looked too midwest For the part . Too midwest -- what the hell does that even mean ?
 Well , the american midwest was mostly settled
 By scandinavian and germanic people . They have a characteristic facial bone structure ...
 I know what it means , sheldon !
 God ! you know , I have been in l . a . for almost two years now ,
 And I haven 't gotten a single acting job .
 I 've accomplished nothing , haven 't gotten
 A raise at work , haven 't even had sex in six months , And just now , when I was walking up those stairs ,
 A fly flew in my mouth and I ate it !
 Well , actually , insects are a dietary staple in many cultures . They 're almost pure protein .
 Oh , son of a bitch !
 I believe the condensation on your frozen foods
 Weakened the structural integrity of the bag .
 But returning to your key conundrum ,
 Perhaps you should call a locksmith And have him open the door for you . I did .
 He said he 'll get here when he gets here . And you 're frustrated because he phrased his reply
 In the form of a meaningless tautology ? no !
 I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything
 And my breath smells like fly .
 There , there .

 Would you prefer to wait in our apartment ? No , sheldon , I 'd rather sit on this freezing- cold floor
 Sobbing like a three- year- old . All right , then .
 For heaven 's sake .

 Just when I think I 've gotten the hang of sarcasm .



 Make yourself comfortable .
 Not there .
 Sheldor is back online .
 Sheldor ? The conqueror .
 What are you doing ?
 Afk .
 I 'm playing
 Age of conan , an online multiplayer game Set in the universe of robert e . howard 's
 Conan the barbarian .


 Sheldor back online . What 's " afk " ?
 Afk .
 Away from keyboard .
 Oh , I see .
 What does that stand for ?
 Oh , I see .
 Yes , but what does it stand for ?
 Now , just click on the enchanted boots to put them on .
 Mm , I don 't know -- can I see them in another color ?
 Just click on them . Yeah , congratulations .
 You are now a level- three warrior . What 's going on ? leonard , guess what ?
 I 'm a level- three warrior .
 Great .
 Do you know there are groceries outside of your apartment ?
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . shh .
 I only bring it up because your ice cream 's melting And it 's starting to attract wildlife . Uh- huh , yeah .
 Do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach ?
 It doesn 't matter -- right now ; you 're looking for treasure .
 Wait , wait , where are you going ? No , no . you 're okay .
 If you run into crocodiles , just kick them with your boots .
 You want to catch me up ? Well , let 's see , uh ,
 She attempted to open her apartment with her car key
 Because her face is overly midwestern , um ...
 She hasn 't had sex in six months ...
 And she ate a fly .
 Seriously ? six months ?
 Oh , my god !
 A treasure chest ! I 'm rich !
 Level three , and she thinks she 's rich .
 What a newb .
 Okay ... We 're all set . Let her rip .

 Hi .
 Check it out -- it 's just corn starch and water . They make up
 A non- newtonian fluid , which is liquid , But solid under the percussive action of the speaker .
 That 's what makes it get all funky .
 Yeah . okay .
 Uh , listen , I need to talk to sheldon .
 No , that 's what she said -- sheldon . Okay , I 'm in the game ,
 And I 've been exploring the island of tortage ,
 But I can 't figure out how to get past the guard captain . Do you have the enchanted sword ?
 No , no , I have a bronze dagger .
 You can 't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger .
 My lord , it 's like the car key In your apartment door all over again . All right , how do I get the sword ?
 Well , have you been to the temple of mishra ?
 Is that the place on the hill with
 - The weird priest in front of it ? - no , no , no , it 's ...
 Oh , for god 's sakes , gimme . Thank you -- I really appreciate this .
 You 're gonna have to learn
 To do these things for yourself , penny .
 Don 't patronize me -- just get the sword !
 What the frack ? Beats me .
 They were playing all last night , too .
 It 's like some kind of weird comic book crossover .
 Like if hulk were dating peppermint patty . I always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian .

 No , that 's marcie .
 Peppermint patty 's just athletic .
 There you go -- one enchanted sword . All right , gimme , gimme , gimme .
 I want to kill the guard captain .
 That girl needs to get a life .
 Sheldon ?
 Sheldon ... Danger ! danger !

 No danger -- it 's just me , penny .
 Listen , I got to level 25 And reached purple lotus swamp , right ?
 You 're in my bedroom .
 Leonard gave me an emergency key .
 People can 't be in my bedroom .
 Well , can we go talk in the living room ?
 I 'm not wearing pajama bottoms .
 Why not ?
 I spilled grape juice .
 Well , wear different pajamas .
 I can 't wear different pajamas -- these are my monday pajamas .
 Penny , people cannot be in my bedroom .
 Okay , fine , just tell me , is it too soon To join a quest to the black castle ?
 - You were invited on a quest to the black castle ? - yeah , yeah .
 By some guys in budapest .
 I 'm just not sure it 's the right move for my character .
 Of course it 's not -- you 're only A level 25 . These hungarians ,
 They 're just using you for dragon fodder .
 Really ? boy , you 'd think you could trust
 A horde of hungarian barbarians .
 Please , penny , enough . I have to sleep .
 Okay , well , you were great .
 Thanks .
 Oh . hey , leonard . listen , don 't go in sheldon 's room -- He 's not wearing bottoms .
 Sheldon , you want to catch me up again ?
 People , I am very busy today .
 I realize that , dr . gablehauser ,
 But it is your job , as head of the department , To mediate all interdepartmental disputes .
 University policy manual , Chapter Four , Subsection Two : " mediation of interdepartmental disputes . "
 Fine .
 Dr. winkle , what colorful name Did you call dr . cooper this time ?
 Dr. dumb- ass .
 Dr. cooper , dr . winkle apologizes . No , I don 't . no , she doesn 't .

 Here 's the problem .
 I was clearly signed up To use the mainframe in buckman 204 ,
 And dr . winkle just wantonly Ripped the sign- up sheet off the wall .
 It wasn 't even an official sign- up sheet .
 He printed it himself , and he put his name down On every slot for the next six months .
 If it is a crime
 To ensure that the university 's resources Are not being squandered chasing subatomic wild geese ,
 Then I plead guilty .
 Oh , penny ! do you need
 To get that , dr . cooper ?
 - God , no .
 - Well , don 't turn it off , You might miss your call from the nobel committee
 Letting you know you 've been nominated
 As dumb- ass laureate of the year . Oh , yeah ? well ...
 You wouldn 't even be nominated .
 Dr. gablehauser , I have a series Of important calculations and simulations to run .
 All she 's doing is reducing irrelevant data And making a mock ...
 Excuse me . Gablehauser .
 It 's for you .
 Hello ?
 Penny , this is not a good time .
 No , I told you , You 're not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls .
 You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest And one should be a level 35 healer .
 Penny , I can 't log on and help you .
 We 'll talk when I get home .
 I 'm not getting the computing time , am i ?
 Dumb- ass .
 Leonard , you have to do something about penny .
 She is interfering with my sleep , She 's interfering with my work ,
 And if I had another significant aspect of my life ,
 I 'm sure she 'd be interfering with that , too .
 Why should I do something ?
 You 're the one who introduced her to online gaming . yes ,
 But you 're the one who said hello to her when she moved in .
 If you 'd simply restrained yourself , None of this would be happening .
 Why don 't you just tell her to leave you alone ?
 I did , I told her , I texted her , I sent out a very emphatic twitter .
 I even changed my facebook status to
 " sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone . "
 I don 't know what else to do .
 Well , what am I supposed to do ?
 I don 't know , but if you don 't figure something out ,
 I warn you , I shall become very difficult to live with .
 You mean up until now we 've been experiencing The happy , fun- time Sheldon ? Yes .
 I 'll go talk to her .
 No , fritz , I need you on my flank .
 No , I don 't know german . Flankenzei , flankenzei .
 Hey , Penny . Busy .
 Yeah , I see that . Shouldn 't you be at work ?
 I don 't work on mondays . It 's thursday .

 Listen , Penny ...
 Queen penelope , afk . What ... ?
 Here 's the thing .
 Sometimes people , good people , Yeah , they start playing these games And they find themselves --
 Through no fault of their own -- You know , kind of ... addicted .
 Yeah , get to the point . I 'm about to level up here .
 It 's just if a person doesn 't have A sense of achievement in their real life ,
 It 's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world Where they can get a false sense of accomplishment .
 Yeah , jabber , jabber , jabber . okay , boys , Queen penelope 's back online .
 Penny , you 've got ...
 Cheetos in your hair .
 Oh . thanks .
 Hey , Penny , it 's me again , Leonard . Leonard , I said not now .
 I know , I 'm just a little concerned about you .
 I said not now !
 Okay , maybe later .
 Hey , guys .
 Hey , what 's with him ?
 Penny 's been keeping him up at night .
 Me , too .
 But probably in a different way .
 She 's gotten really hooked on age of conan . She 's playing nonstop .
 Ah , yes , online gaming addiction .
 There 's nothing worse than having That multi- player monkey on your back .
 Sheldon , wake up ! Danger ! danger !
 Afternoon , men . Sheldon .
 Oh , yeah ?
 Well , your attempt at juvenilizing me By excluding me from the set of adult males , just ...
 Oh , I 'm too tired to do this .
 Right . I heard you 've been pulling all- nighters With middle earth barbie .
 She comes into my room .
 No one 's supposed to be in my room .
 I would postulate that she 's escaping into the online world To compensate for her sexual frustration .
 I do that , too .
 But probably in a different way .
 That 's not what she 's doing , Leslie .
 She 's just trying to shore up her self- esteem . It has nothing to do with sex .
 Everything has to do with sex .
 Mm , testify .
 I 'm not touching that .
 Leslie , you are way off base here .
 Hang on , leonard .
 While I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist Or a human being, for that matter ,
 We have to Concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields Of promiscuity and general sluttiness .
 Thank you .
 My point is that tinker bell just needs to get her some . Some what ?

 Oh , yes , some sexual intercourse .

 I 'll take the bullet .
 Excuse me , this whole idea is insane .
 Enough debate , I 'm going to take action .
 Excuse me .
 Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship ?
 No .
 Would you like to be ?
 Uh ... sure , why not ? Sheldon ...

 Puh- puh- puh .
 Can I have your phone number ?
 Uh ... yeah .
 There . problem solved .
 Dumb- ass .
 Okay , I 'm at the gate to the treasury of the ancients . I 'm going in .
 Stay close to the wall .
 Avoid the mummies . got it .
 I must say you 're playing very well for a woman of 23 . Twenty- two .
 Right , 22 .
 Oh , here come the mummies .
 Which spell do I use , the hateful strike Or the frenzy stance ?
 What happened to the rest of your group ?
 I dumped them , they 're a bunch of wussies .
 Frenzy stance .
 Frenzy , frenzy , frenzy , frenzy , frenzy .
 So , listen , would you describe your ideal vacation As a wild adventure to unknown lands
 Or staying at home curled up with a good book ?
 What ?
 These are market research questions .
 I 'm filling out the online registration for your game .
 Oh , okay , wild adventure .
 Oh , frenzy stance isn 't working .
 Die , you undead mummy , die ! Drink a healing potion .
 Thank you . you 're welcome .
 Anyhow , on a scale of one to five ,
 With one being always initiated by him
 And five being always initiated by you , How do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin ?
 That 's on the registration ?
 Oh , yes , it 's quite extensive .
 But if we complete it , You get a free expansion pack . 75 additional quests .
 Ooh , awesome , okay , I totally like to initiate . I 'm a big ol ' five .
 Good to know . Big ol ' five .
 Hello . Hi .
 Leonard , this is tom .
 Hi , tom . sheldon ...
 Didn 't I explain to you About your little mistake in the cafeteria ?
 Yes , You were very clear .
 As was everyone else at the table .
 Tom , however , has been chosen by science As a suitable mate for penny .
 Chosen by science ?
 Well , what passes for science on dating sites .
 They claim to use heuristic algorithms ,
 But it may well be hokum . You got penny to sign up for online dating ?
 No , of course not . See , I used trickery and deceit .
 This is bad .
 Tom is a paramedic with the fire department , But he 's going to med school at night .
 He likes the outdoors
 And , uh , strong women who initiate sex .
 Really , really bad . I 'm surprised you struck out with penny .
 Apparently , she 's a big ol ' five .
 Sheldon , what do you want ? Oh , good ,
 You got my note . Penny , I 'd like you to meet tom .
 Penny , this is tom . Tom , may I present penny . Hi , penny .
 Yeah , hey . listen ...
 As long as I 'm here , I 'm on a quest with a bunch of newbs .
 They don 't know what they 're doing .
 We 've got one assassin , Three spell casters and no tank .
 Can we talk about this later ? No , no , no , no .
 I need you now . Wouldn 't you prefer to socialize with tom , Who is a sexually passive outdoorsman ?
 Whatever . I 'll figure it out myself .
 Bye , penny .
 I 'm sorry , dude , she didn 't look anything like her picture .
 They never do
 hello , fair penny .
 Who are you ?
 It is i , sir howard of wolowitz .

 Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing
 Followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern ? Yeah , sure , why not ?

 Oh , my god , I need help .
