 00 : 00 : 00, 858 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 006 The Big Bang Theory ... Can I have your attention , please ?
 We 're all here tonight because we have no one to be with .
 We 've got to stop defining our self- worth by whether or not we 're in a relationship .
 We are a community , and as long as we have each other , we 're never truly alone .
 That was cool . What you said .
 Thank you .

 Uh ... would you like to , uh ... get a cup ... a cup of coffee ... ?
 Okay .

 Later , losers !
 So then I went to Cambridge , which was wonderful not only because it 's a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts .
 That 's where I fell in love with astronomy , and now I 'm an astrophysicist at Caltech , so I guess you could say , uh ,
 Raj is my name and stars are my game .
 And rhyming is also my game .
 So , uh , two games . Uh , anyway , that- that 's enough about me .
 I want to hear everything about you .
 I have to go to the bathroom .
 I go to the bathroom , too .
 Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit .
 Oh , I 've had it checked out , it 's nothing .
 Hmm !
 This is going great !
 Mmm ... can I have a refill on my chai tea ? ( sighs ) Yes ...
 I have a good feeling about this .

 Original Air Date on February 21 , 2013 Hello , I 'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper .
 Welcome to

 My apologies that this episode is coming late .
 I did shoot one last week , in honor of Black History Month , but I was informed by my roommate that my spot- on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered " wildly racist . "

 My heart goes out to the members of the African- American community , who , like me , have been kept down by The Man .
 Now , is not just for the flag aficionado ; it 's also for the flag novice , so , to help me with that , please welcome my friend , neighbor , and flag virgin -- yeah , not a real virgin .
 She 's had coitus many times .
 Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast .
 Once while he was trying to watch
 Penny .
 Hello . So , Penny , I understand you would like to learn more about flags .

 Yeah , I can 't tell you how many times I 've been at a party where everyone 's talking about flags and I just couldn 't join in .
 Yeah .
 Well , you came to the right place .
 Uh , I 'm sorry , can we just pause for a minute ?
 What 's wrong ?
 I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera , you know , like , like a real conversation .
 It 's something we work on in my acting class .
 Interesting .
 A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic .
 Perhaps that isn 't the compliment it sounds like .
 Yeah , let 's try it again , and maybe , this time , you could work on your body language a bit .
 You know , when you 're all hunched like that , you 're shutting the audience out , but when you 're relaxed and open , you 're inviting them in .
 Right .
 And which one do I want ?
 Let 's try open . If our friend , the flag , has taught me anything , it 's to go where the wind takes you .
 As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole .
 And ... action .
 ( chuckles )

 So , Penny ... what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night ?
 Um , well , I 'm from Nebraska .
 So what can you tell me about the state flag ?
 Gosh , Penny ... what 'd you have for breakfast ?
 A big glass of good question juice ?
 The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue .
 Spread your legs ; invite them in .
 I 'm telling you , something 's wrong .
 I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble .
 Geez , how close were you guys before we got married ?
 Don 't look under that rock .
 ( knocking on door )
 Raj , you okay ?
 You in there ?
 KOOTHRAPALl : Go away !
 Come on , buddy , open up .
 We 're worried about you . Oh , just because I stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened ?
 Maybe something good happened .
 Did something good happen ?
 Of course not !
 Nothing good ever happens !
 Whoa .
 What ?
 Nope , just- just ... whoa .
 It smells pretty ripe in here .
 You kind feel it in your eyes .
 Raj , what 's going on ?
 I was humiliated by yet another woman .
 You didn 't kill her and chop her up -- that 's not what we 're smelling , right ?
 No . I took her for coffee , and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me .

 Oh , you poor baby .
 I went and looked .
 It was a high and tiny window .
 She must have been very motivated . I 'm sorry .
 That 's awful , but come on . you got to shake it off .
 Yeah , you can 't stay in your apartment for the rest of your life .
 Why not ?
 With online shopping and overnight delivery ,
 I can get anything I want . Look , I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon .


 Lobsters overnight ?
 Oh , you 're kidding .
 Let me see . Well , I 'll be .
 Look , you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf .
 The surf and turf sounds good .
 See if they corn on the cob .
 Guys !
 We 're trying to get him out of here , not you in .
 You 're wasting your time .
 Just please , leave me alone .
 ( door closes )
 Now what ?
 I don 't know .
 We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it .
 We 're all thinking it .
 I just had the decency to wait for him to leave .
 ( line ringing )
 Hello , Sheldon .
 Hello .
 How 's the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going ?
 ( monkeys screeching ) Fine .
 Just hold on .
 Mommy 's on the phone !
 Sorry . We 've cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day , so things are a little intense .
 Makes me miss my marijuana- abusing flatworms .
 Those guys were mellow .
 Good news .
 Uh , the latest episode of is online .
 Oh , that 's right . How 'd it go with Penny ?
 Much better than I expected . She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language .
 Watch .
 Welcome to my world .
 Not welcome to my world .
 Welcome .
 Not welcome .
 Subtle , but powerful .
 I know .
 I 'm still learning to control it .
 Did you tell Penny how helpful she was ?
 Why would I do that ?
 Because she 's your friend , and she did a nice job .
 I 'm sure she 'd like to hear it .
 All right . I didn 't mean now .
 Hello ? ( monkeys screeching )
 Yeah , yeah , you want a cigarette .
 Well , I 'd like a normal boyfriend .
 Deal with it .

 Oh , hi .
 What 's up ?
 Um ...
 You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing ?
 No .
 I didn 't start yet ; it 's fine . Okay .
 So , what do you need ?
 Well , I was thinking about you helping me out last night ...
 Penny .
 And I just wanted to tell you ...
 Penny . ... that the answer to the question ,
 " Who did a great job ? " is you . Penny .
 Really ?
 Yes , you were very natural in front of the camera , and I found your suggestions extremely helpful .
 Aw , sweetie , you just made my day .
 Okay . Hey , my acting class is putting on a play Friday night .
 I could put you and Amy on the guest list .
 Oh , that sounds terrible .
 Why would I want to do that ?
 ( monkeys screeching ) That 's right . They 're no good without the lighter .
 Well , so much for your advice on complimenting Penny .
 Why ? What happened ?
 She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play .
 Don 't worry . Luckily , I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river .
 Sheldon , that 's very rude .
 She helped you with your show .
 The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play . Oh , so many crazy rules .
 ( screeching resumes ) That better be Tootsie Rolls you 're throwing at me !
 Penny . Penny .
 Penny .
 Oh yeah , much better .

 What ? Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me ,
 I 'm obligated to do something nice for you .
 So ... yes , I 'll go to your dopey play .
 Hey , I don 't want you to go anymore .
 Why not ?
 You should go 'cause you want to go , not because you have to .
 Oh , Dear Lord , more rules ?
 Where does it stop ? Can I want to go because I have to want to go ?
 Okay .
 Do whatever you want .
 Yeah , but now , wait .
 Do whatever I want ... or whatever I have to want ?
 Oh , for God 's sake , just come to the play .
 All right .
 I don 't want to , but at least that makes sense .

 You know , I haven 't seen Raj in several days .
 Is he no longer a part of our social group ? And if so , should we be interviewing for a replacement ?
 Perhaps , this time , we go Latin .

 He 's just decided he 's never leaving his apartment again .
 Oh , brilliant .
 I 've been itching to pull that trigger . He 's upset because he can 't get anywhere with women .
 Would it help if I gave him some pointers ?
 I 'm just funnin ' ya .
 ( laughs )

 Hi .
 I don 't know if you remember me , but I was here the other night at your party .
 Oh , yeah , you left with Raj .
 LUCY : Uh , yeah . You 're the one ?
 Okay , let me tell you something .
 That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend .
 Okay ?
 He was devastated .
 Sorry .
 Can you just give him this ? Okay .
 But I gotta warn you , Raj is a proud , passionate man .
 If you go running out on him again , you 're only gonna get , like , three or four more chances before you are history .
 Come on , she came back .
 This is good news .
 You should celebrate .
 I don 't want to celebrate .

 Not even a little ?
 I mean ... we could have a pants party .
 Go put some on .
 Why would I want her number ?
 I don 't want anything to do with this woman . Oh , come on , Raj ... No , you don 't get it .
 I want nothing to do with any woman .
 My heart is stone .
 From now on , I 'm a monk .
 I renounce all worldly pleasures .
 Except for lobster . And garlic butter .
 Boy , I want to tell you it 's her loss , but you are not making it easy .
 You 're- you 're a good friend for trying to help , but ...
 I 've made my choice .
 All right .
 Well , I 'll see you around .
 See you .
 Oh , wait -- take her number .
 I don 't want the temptation . Okay .
 I must be strong so I don 't stray from my true purpose : the study of the universe .
 All right .

 Thanks for ruining lobster for me .


 KOOTHRAPPALl : Wait !
 Give me the number !
 Give me the number ! Give me the number !
 So , Amy , what 's going on with your addiction study ?
 Sadly , I 'm no longer associated with that project .
 Why ? What happened ?
 Typical bureaucratic nonsense .
 You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance , you can dissect their brains , but you throw their own feces back at them and suddenly you 're " unprofessional . "
 I 'm sorry ... ... that I asked .

 All right , let 's get this stupid play over with .
 Uh , hang on .
 Empty your pockets .
 Why ?
 You know why .
 The Nintendo DS .
 ( sighs )
 And the PSP .
 ( raspy exhale )

 Now the Gameboy .
 Aw , for Pete 's sake .
 Can we go now ?
 Well , is that all of it ?

 Just set it down .

 Just so you know , this is not a stupid play .
 is an American classic .
 It 's about streetcars ?
 Oh , great .
 I won 't need this .


 Just a sec .
 Oh , who says " just a sec " ?
 I hate myself !

 Hello .
 Hi .
 Uh , would you like to come in ? Oh , no , I can 't stay .
 Oh .
 I just wanted to say ...
 I 'm sorry for running out of the coffee shop .
 That wasn 't cool .
 So , uh ...
 Yeah .
 I 'm sorry .
 Wait .
 Can you at least tell me what went wrong ?
 It 's okay .
 I can take anything .
 Unless it 's something I did , or said , or am . ' Cause those are , like , my buttons .

 No , it 's not any of that .
 It 's just ...
 I kind of have a hard time around people I don 't know .
 Really ?
 Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night ?
 I 've been trying to force myself into situations that I 'm not comfortable with .
 I saw the flyer in the store window , and I made myself go in .
 I don 't even like comic books .
 ( laughs )
 Yeah , me neither .
 Then what were you doing there ? I lied .
 I love them .
 I only said that so you 'd go out with me .
 Oh , you don 't want to do that .
 I 'm kind of broken .
 That 's great .
 I 'm broken , too .
 Oh , no , you 're not .
 Oh , I totally am . If it wasn 't for this beer ,
 I couldn 't even talk to you right now .
 I 'm a wreck .
 There are many things seriously wrong with me . And not quirks , either .
 Like ... diagnosable psychological problems .
 Maybe brain damage .
 Well , how do I know you 're not just saying that ?
 Go out with me on one date , and I promise you , you 'll see .

 Okay . ( sighs with relief )
 Text me . Bye .
 You won 't regret it . I 'm the most pathetic guy you 've ever met .

 And that , boys and girls ... is how it 's done .



 You love her very much , don 't you ?
 Yes .
 PENNY :
 I think you have a great capacity for devotion .
 You 'll be lonely when she passes on , won 't you ?
 I understand what that is .
 ACTOR :
 To be lonely ?
 ( quietly ) :
 She 's pretty good , huh ?
 She is .
 But when do they get to the part about streetcars ?
 ... when I was a very young girl .
 When I was 16 years old , I made the discovery ...
 love .
 All at once , and much , much too completely .
 It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow .
 That 's how it struck the world for me .

 But I was unlucky .
 Deluded . She 's remarkable . She really is .
 Our Penny 's a star .
 PENNY : ... and softness and tenderness which ...
 How can she remember all those lines , but as a waitress , she can 't remember
 " no tomato " on my hamburger ?
