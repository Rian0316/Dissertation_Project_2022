 My progeny has joined the ranks of the graduated .
 You applied to all those schools for me ?
 A few fallbacks , too , just in case .
 You 're not my mother , you 're not in charge of who I talk to , and you 're sure as shit not in charge of if I go to college !
 We 've been banging like bunnies , and I can 't get pregnant .
 What 'll you do ?
 Are you out of your fucking mind ?
 Kev is just gonna lie down with you for procreation , not sex .
 Wham , bam , thank you , mom .
 What are you doing wearing my top ?
 Pheromones , I 'm borrowing them .
 It 's the thing boys like about you .
 You mean tits ?
 I think you might be a year or two off .
 Are you gonna marry someone who screws guys for a living ?
 Who gives a shit ? It 's a fucking piece of paper .
 You love me .
 Just this once , fucking admit it .
 I want to enlist .
 When 's the next bus to basic combat training ?
 - Tomorrow morning . - Philip .
 It 's Lip .
 It 's just Gallagher now . Get on .
 I was wondering if you 'd seen Jimmy lately .
 Any sign of conflict , things not going his way , and he just disappears .
 - It 's what he does . - Be a man .
 Get onto the boat .
 Can I just make one phone call to Fiona , please ?
 Last message , I promise .
 Wherever you are , bye .
 You the temp ?
 Yes . Fiona Gallagher .
 Mr. Pratt is asking for a word with you .
 - Let me guess , he 's the boss . - Not the big boss ,
 - but he is a supervisor , yes . - We sort of ditched the party .
 Well , then you better behave yourself , because I am way too drunk not to invite you back to my tent right now .
 They said if you don 't stop drinking , you 're gonna die .
 So I 'm just supposed to stop drinking so that you don 't feel guilty ?
 You 're supposed to stop drinking because you have children at home who love you .
 What if I don 't want to change ?
 Then I would know what I 've always feared is true , that you don 't give a shit about any of us . - original sub by MoS / Synced and corrected by chamallow - - www . addic7ed . com -
 Hey , Carl .
 Carl , hey .
 You got any bears stuff I can wear to the game today , like a hat or a Jersey or something ?
 I got a " Fuck Jay Cutler " T- shirt .
 It might have blood on it , though .
 Thanks , but no thanks .
 Morning , sunshine .
 Good morning . Good morning .
 Don 't get too comfortable up there . Ian 's gonna want his old bed back when he comes home .
 Where are you going ?
 - Out . - On a Sunday morning ?
 Are those my boots ?
 - Occupied ! - I got to take a piss !
 - Go away ! - Use the downstairs bathroom .
 It 's downstairs .
 You 're young . You 'll live .
 No , absolutely not . No more peeing off the balcony .
 What the fuck ?
 Carl !
 Morning , Mrs. Babiak .
 There 's a toilet right there .
 Mrs. Babiak doesn 't need an anatomy lesson .
 Please , Mrs. Babiak 's got my 18th birthday circled on her calendar .
 - Use the toilet like a human . - Can I have Lip 's old room ?
 - No . - He 's at college .
 Seriously , cut the shit with the nature whizzing , or you won 't live here anymore .
 That pierogi- eating prune will call the cops .
 And no , you can 't have Lip 's old room .
 He 's gonna be home in the summer and for holidays .
 Oh , you going clubbing ?
 Hanging out with Holly .
 Are you two gonna work the corner ?
 Shut up , zit head .
 At least I got zits , no- pubes girl .
 Okay , enough , both of you .
 Cereal , brother .
 You think you might be a little overdressed for Sunday morning at Holly 's ?
 It 's not like we 're going to church .
 You 're watching Liam today , remember ?
 I haven 't abused marijuana like the rest of you , - so yes , I remember . - I have the Mike thing .
 I said my memory 's intact .
 Big , yellow icy spot on the sidewalk . I almost dropped the dip .
 Spike must 've chewed through his fence again .
 My world famous artichoke- jalape√±o dip .
 Eddie loved it . He used to spread it on his waffles .
 Thanks , Sheila . It smells great .
 Why is she here again ?
 I don 't care . Our laundry 's clean .
 - Any new texts from Ian ? - Uh , no .
 You check your phone this morning ?
 - Yes . - It 's been almost a week .
 He 'll be back when he 's back .
 We should file a missing persons report .
 We are not going to the police , okay ?
 He 's 17 .
 We don 't have to be happy about it , but I trust him .
 No surprise he ran away from this gulag . It 's not like anyone gives a damn if any of us live or die !
 Liam ?
 I heard you the first 300 billion times .
 - $270 ? - Prenatal visits aren 't cheap , and Dr. Susie is cash up front .

 What 's wrong with the free clinic ?
 You want your baby mama waiting hours next to crab- infested hookers and toothless crackheads ?
 What happened to the 200 that I gave you last week ?
 Uh , ultrasounds , prenatal vitamins , and then I found this cute , little , black maternity number at nordstroms , too .
 See what I 'm saying ?
 Hey , Kev , you got a bears Jersey I can borrow ? Mike 's taking me to the game today .
 Borrow as in I get it right back , or borrow as in you plan to keep it forever and forget it isn 't yours ?
 Get it right back , promise .
 You still staying away from hot dogs and unpasteurized cheese ?
 And no sprouts . I know how you love to shovel it in at the Sizzler salad bar .
 Honey , I was still doing coke when I was pregnant with you , and now you worried about me eating cheese ?
 All right , Carol , no nordstroms , okay ?
 Do you hear me ? No nordstroms .
 Sweatpants and Adele 's old muumuus from Goodwill .
 I 'll stop by after church .
 We can go shopping for some sensible shoes . My feet are starting to spread .
 In a month , I 'm gonna be able to water- ski without the skis .
 All right , thanks . Bye .
 Bye , mama .
 There 's no way we can afford the maternity ward .
 She 's just gonna have to have the baby upstairs in the tub .
 We can get tinisha from down the block to help out .
 Tinisha 's not a midwife .
 No , but she 's had a shitload of babies .
 William " the refrigerator " Perry .
 There 's a player named after a kitchen appliance ?
 Was .
 Your mom doesn 't have health insurance at work ?
 No . And I would 've never agreed to bang my own mom- in- law if I had known she wasn 't covered .
 You and Mike getting serious ?
 I mean , I 'm not , like , falling in love or anything , but I like him .
 The sex good ?
 I don 't know yet .
 First- date Fiona ?
 The girl who puts out waiting in line at the Wendy 's drive- through ?
 Who told you that ? Ronny finnegan ?
 Ben troutman .
 Jesus Christ , you 've done that more than once ?
 So nothing at all with you and Mike ?
 A little dry humping , a couple of hand jobs .
 But no , he 's my boss , so we 're going slow .
 Maybe they don 't fuck right away in the middle class .
 It 's definitely weird .
 He doesn 't , like , force himself onto me where I 've got to decide if I 'm gonna taser him or go along ,
 like I do with the guys from around here .
 Still nothing from Jimmy ?
 In the wind . Not a word .
 Well , fuck him . He was a pussy anyway .
 - And no Frank ? - Nope .
 Oh , thank Jesus for small blessings . You 're better off without him .
 No , he 'll be back . Frank 's a cockroach .
 You can stomp on him , spray him , try and drown him , but he always comes crawling back up out of the toilet bowl .
 - Police department . - Police !
 - Police ! - Hands . Come on , hands !
 Hands up !
 Check over there .
 - Police department ! - Back room clear .
 Police .
 What , you don 't think I saw you stash that ?
 Come on , hands .
 Police . Show us your hands .
 Down on the ground .
 Let me see your hands , come on .
 Get 'em up .
 Come on , pal , hands . Let 's go .
 Yo , hands out , now .
 Frank ?
 Hi , Mandy . Nice tam .
 Thanks . How you been ?
 Good .
 Ian 's still missing . Have you heard from him ?
 Nothing ? Not even a call or a text ?
 Sorry .
 So you want to know how Lip 's doing ?
 Not really .
 - He 's in college . - Good for him .
 This is a bunch of bills , chink delivery menus , and press- on nail coupons .
 What mailboxes you rob , the dearborn projects ?
 Apartment complex over by rush .
 There 's an ATM card .
 Congratulations . It has no fucking pin number .
 What are you gonna do , rob the same mailboxes every day until they send the pin ?
 Hey , you ...
 This is all you made yesterday ?
 I give you everything .
 220 bucks ?
 How many Johnsons did you squash ?
 17 .
 That 's , like , 12 bucks a wank .
 - Who was at the door ? - Debbie Gallagher .
 - What did she want ? - She was looking for Ian .
 You seen him ?
 - Why do you care ? - Don 't .
 She said Lip was doing good in college .
 Yo .
 - Hey . - Hi .
 It 's time to go , Ron .
 Byronic heroes study group .
 I have to stop by the lab first .
 I 'm building a new docking station for my cloud city .
 Now , Ron .
 Hey , so did you get the text about tomorrow 's flash mob ?
 The what ?
 5 : 00 , man .
 Everyone 's gonna freeze for exactly 60 seconds .
 Okay .
 We 'll be on the second floor of the library in the back at 3 : 00 if you want to join us for our study group .
 Um , we agreed to keep the group small .
 - We already have six people , so ... - Lip can come , he 's cool .
 You know what , maybe later , you know , after work- study .
 Hi .
 Fiona !
 - What ? - Mike .
 Ugh . What is this , Saw ?
 On a Sunday morning ?
 Mike your real name ?
 Yeah .
 I mean , Michael , but yeah , I 'm Mike .
 - Ever steal a car ? - What ?
 Ever burn your blood- soaked clothes in the yard ?
 - Hi . - Yeah , hi .
 - You ready to go ? - Uh , yeah , absolutely .
 Uh , okay .
 I 'll be back around 6 : 00 .
 Don 't set the house on fire .
 Just kidding .
 - Really ? - Oh , yeah .
 Just wait till my mom paints your face .
 Not much virginity- bidding action on Sunday morning .
 What are you up to now ?
 - 725 .
 - Wow .
 " Jumbojohnson " ?
 Guy sounds like he could be kind of scary .
 Or just really fat .
 Can 't be scarier than my mom 's new boyfriend , Gary .
 At least this guy 's prepared to pay for it .
 Anybody bid on me yet ?
 Uh , no .
 But not surprising with the minimum bid you set . $1 million ?
 You can only sell it once .
 Makes it an extremely rare commodity .
 Scarcity equals value . Basic economics .
 You think I 'm selling myself short ?
 Well , in your case , it 's kind of false advertising .
 By , like , a couple dozen dudes .
 You 're not really going to call that jumbojohnson , are you ?
 Probably not .
 It 's not fair .
 My retarded brother is a year younger than me , and he 's already sprouting pit hair .
 Hey , you 're lucky . At least you can fool around and not worry about birth control .
 When did you ever worry about birth control , Ellie ?
 It 's embarrassing . I 'm 13 .
 Come on , let 's get slutty and head over to the arcade , troll for high school boys . That 'll cheer you up .
 Door !
 Door !
 Frank ?
 Where is everybody ?
 Ian ran away , Lip 's at college , Debbie took Liam somewhere with her skanky girlfriend , Holly .
 - Fiona ? - Bears game .
 She 's banging some dude from work .
 We get free cups .
 Well , uh , okay .
 Good luck .
 Mm . Great dip , Fiona .
 - Thanks . - Oh , it looks yummy .
 Artichoke ?
 - Yeah , and jalape√±o . - Family recipe ?
 Yeah , absolutely .
 Yo , stick !
 - Catch ! - Stick ?
 Oh , well , Mike was a bit overweight as a kid .
 A bit ?
 If you pushed him over , he 'd roll .
 So when he started losing the weight ,
 - we started calling him stick . - That ... that is not why .
 And it 's not " stick . " It 's " the stick . "
 No , no . No .
 - Okay . - Don 't tell that story , Jane .
 So here 's the deal .
 Mikey 's first girlfriend , Emily , from down the block ...
 Leave your brother alone .
 She was this , like , scrawny , little girl until one summer , boom !
 All of a sudden she 's got , like , this smoking little bod .
 - Jane , stop it . - Remember ?
 Stop what ?
 I 'm just telling Fiona about Emily and the stick .
 - No ! - So anyway ...
 - No , come on . - Emily 's this girl .
 - She 's got legs , like up to here , - Don 't listen to a word she says . - and Mikey is this , like fat ...
 - She 's still just trying to get even with me for sending that clip in to America 's Funniest Home Videos .
 Well , that 's 'cause that was not funny , Mikey , so ...
 A couple million people thought it was funny , Jane .
 You were on Funniest Home Videos ?
 Yeah , she used to , when she was a baby , imitate our dog .
 Mike , we have a guest .
 Anyway ... so anyway , here 's the deal .
 So Emily comes over to use our pool , right ?
 And she 's got this , like , itty- bitty , little bikini on .
 - All right . - I bet you remember , don 't you ?
 All right . Okay . Chicken war !
 Come on . Come on . Piggyback , come on .
 I want to hear the thing about the stick !
 No , you don 't . It 's all lies .
 - All right , come on . Ready ? - Yeah .
 Whoa ! Here comes Marshall , streaking down the sideline .
 Holy ... the safety 's out of position !
 Yes !
 Hey .
 - Hay is for horses . - Huh ?
 Can I help you with something ?
 Oh , my .
 Yeah .
 Well , you grab his feet , and I 'll grab the top end .
 Gentle , gentle .
 Ooh , God !
 Oh , my God , does he smell .
 Headfirst , headfirst .
 What about this as an under ... scoop under ?
 Frank , you 're filthy !
 You 're filthy !
 Jesus .
 Wow .
 Did something just jump off him ?
 Bugs , I think .
 3 : 00 , playing " The Swarm . "
 There are only two .
 We 're not trolling for you and the baby biscuit , Ellie .
 Only pervs are gonna want any part of that .
 Which one should I like ?
 You like the one in the Autopsy hoodie , and I 'll like the one with the wallet chain .
 So what do we do , just walk over and talk to them ?
 No , honey .
 We chum the waters , wait for the fish to bite .
 First stage . Here we go ! Tear it up , y 'all .
 Ready , set , step !
 Hi .
 Hi . Debbie .
 Matty . Matty .
 Come on .
 Oh , no , no . I don 't know how to ...
 - I don 't know what I 'm doing . - Up , down .
 No , you 're doing really good .
 - Yeah ? - Better than me .
 That 's it .
 - You got it . - Up , down .
 Should we give him another bath ?
 Well , that 's three already , and we 're kind of running out of soap .
 These are gluten- free ?
 That 's what the sign says .
 - And vegan ? - Soy cheese , yeah .
 What about peanuts ?
 Uh , no nuts in the soy cheese pizza , but I can 't promise the cook didn 't put his nuts on the cheese pizza .
 You guys done with these ? Yo , you done with these plates ?
 Amen , amigo .
 Just a bunch of spoiled *** .
 Hey , you better not let Manny see you doing that .
 Oh , what 's he gonna do , fire me ?
 It 's not like they 're actually paying me .
 Here .
 Hey , you want to get together sometime , hang out ?
 You know , I got some decent weed .
 Sorry , but I can 't , man .
 I got to get home to the Esposa and Ninos .
 - Right . - Andrew , uh ...
 Fuck .
 You get something to eat ?
 What ?
 No . Fuck , no .
 Tony brought him back .
 He 's been asleep the whole time .
 I tried to wake him , but he 's out cold .
 Believe me , he 's not sleeping .
 Great .
 Now this ? Needles ?
 - He 's really sick . - Oh , he 's sick , all right .
 I don 't think he can make it downstairs .
 - He won 't be any trouble . - No .
 - I don 't get a vote ? - Not really , no .
 I 'm gonna call Kev , and he 's gonna help me find a park bench somewhere far , far away to dump him .
 - He 's dying ! - No , he 's killing himself .
 - There 's a difference . - I can take care of him .
 - No . - Yes ! - No !
 - Yes !
 Fine .
 But you brought him home . He 's your puppy .
 He makes a mess on the rug , you 're cleaning it up .
 Thank you , son .
 Yeah , whoo !
 Is he yours ?
 - Who ? - The little kid .
 Oh , no .
 - Brother . - Oh , okay .
 Okay , I thought maybe he was , like , yours .
 No .
 Do you ... do you want a ... do you want a ride home ?
 You have a car ?
 Yeah , yeah .
 Not like a ... it 's not a very nice one , but yeah ... yeah , I have ...
 I have a car .
 - Sure . - Cool .
 I 'm just gonna let you , like , finish .
 - All right . - Okay , just shut up .
 Wait , am I finishing myself here ?
 No , I 'll ...
 I 'll help you .
 Okay , good .
 That 's gross .
 For Christ 's sake , just fuck her !
 Fuck .
 Night , Debbie .
 You dirty , little cup boy .
 Hey , up .
 Hey , school .
 - Wet dream ? - What ?
 I heard you moaning in your sleep .
 You 're a Gallagher .
 It goes with the over- sexed glandular Gallagher equipment .
 - What are you now , 10 ? - 12 .
 Late bloomer .
 It 's natural . Nothing to worry about .
 The best way to stay ahead of it ... is to masturbate a few times a day .
 Masturbate ?
 Uh , enjoying yourself while you 're awake .
 Oh , jerking off .
 Simple pleasures .
 But never in the shower .
 It can get on a washcloth and into your sisters .
 That 's how incest babies are born .
 You know , son , I 'm ... I 'm sick .
 I can 't drink anymore , but my body still needs alcohol to function properly .
 It 's like oil in an engine .
 The pistons just won 't fire right without it .
 Maybe you could hunt up some supplies for me ?
 Will you do that for me , son ?
 Help the old man out ?
 I 'm sorry , baby . I 'm not feeling so good .
 You want me to take your temperature - with my big , red thermometer ? - Mm- mm , my stomach .
 - Bad night . - Oh yeah ?
 Really ?
 You sure ?
 I think I 'm gonna be sick .
 You know , I told you to throw out that leftover vindaloo .
 Hey , " V " ?
 You okay ?
 You want me to get you something ?
 A 7- up or a shot of Tequila or something ?
 " V " ?
 I 'll be out in a minute , honey .
 Can you ... can you start some tea for me , please ?
 You got to be shitting me .
 - There 's something in my juice . - It 's pulp .
 We can afford pulp ?
 Yeah .
 Getting a steady paycheck , courtesy of worldwide cup .
 What ?
 - Dad 's upstairs . - So ?
 - Are you gonna say hi ? - No .
 Where 's my lunch ?
 You 're each getting $3 to buy your very own school lunch .
 Four ?
 Five .
 Fine , no problem . Five it is .
 The Gallagher clan is flush .
 We 're creeping up on the poverty line .
 Haven 't quite dragged ourselves over it yet , but at least we can see it from here .
 Hey , dishes to the sink .
 It 's more like six if you want Chips .
 How about we skip the Chips ?
 Good morning , everyone .
 Morning .
 Got a busy day today .
 Gonna tackle the upstairs bathroom .
 That 'll be a challenge .
 Good thing I ate my wheaties .
 What 's up with Frank this morning ?
 - Still looks bad . - Yeah ?
 Do I have to padlock him in the room for the day ?
 I don 't think he can get up .
 I don 't want him wandering around , going through my stuff , pawning the microwave and the TV .
 What if he has to use the bathroom ?
 Don 't forget to empty it when you get back from school .
 I don 't even think that 's minimum wage , man .
 There 's got to be , like , a law or something , right ?
 Yeah , I 'm pretty sure there is , but I don 't think it covers hand jobs .
 12 bucks a wank , that 's what she makes on a fucking good day .
 Jesus , really ?
 I 've been paying 30 at that thai place .
 Yeah , but that 's 'cause Sasha charges the customers a shit ton more and then deducts all this stuff from the girls ' pay .
 Laundry , rent , janitorial , utilities .
 She charges them for the purell and mouthwash .
 They need a union to protect their rights .
 Yeah , the international brotherhood of hand wankers and cock suckers .
 I 'd love to see that sign on the side of a building downtown .
 Why not ?
 Hey , it 'd make one hell of a picket sign , though , huh ?
 " Whores united for handy Jay justice . "
 Wankers of the world , unite !
 - You heard from Gallagher ? - Frank ? No .
 I thought Frank was dead .
 Not fucking Frank . The other one , the redhead .
 Ian ? No , he took off .
 What , did he owe you money or something ?
 Hello . Who ?
 Anybody know a Mr. Phillips ?
 No , sorry , pal .
 Oh , wait , wait , wait . Hold on , yeah .
 Um , hold on .
 Uh , yeah , this is Mr. Phillips .
 Thanks .
 Yeah , I 'll be over later .
 What ?
 Stan . He 's sick .
 I got to go to the home after work .
 Who the fuck is Stan ?
 The guy who owns the bar .
 A legend among loan sharks .
 Broke more kneecaps in his day than any other shylock on the south side .
 Hell of a guy .
 - To Stan . - Yeah , Stan .
 - To Stan . - To Stan .
 How is that possible ?
 Well , when a man 's penis goes into a woman 's ...
 Yeah , I got that part .
 I mean , how is it possible now , after everything we 've tried for the last two years ?
 Mother nature can be a tricky bitch sometimes .
 What , did you think you were just gaining weight in your breasts while you missed your period ?
 I eat a lot when I 'm under stress .
 You 've been under stress ?
 Watching my husband bang my mother ?
 Yeah , that 's been a bit stressful .
 Well , all of that 's behind you now .
 You 're definitely pregnant .
 This is good news , Veronica .
 Good morning .
 - Secret admirer ? - I guess so .
 Maybe not that secret anymore .
 Really ?
 Dave in shipping saw you two at the bears game yesterday , instagramed a photo .
 Everybody in the company follows him .
 Were we doing something embarrassing ?
 The kiss Cam , I think .
 Morning .
 Go bears , huh ?
 Uh , I am almost done with the quarterly midwest regional reports .
 Can I get them to you after lunch ?
 - No sweat . - Great .
 What ?
 You 've been working here three months as of today .
 Wow , three months ? Really ?
 - That 's great .
 - After 90 days , your full benefits kick in , medical , dental , pension .
 Really ? That 's fantastic .
 So now it 's time for the talk .
 - The talk ? - The 401k talk .
 Have you decided which plan you 'd like to adopt ?
 What 's a 401k ?
 Your retirement savings plan .
 You 're eligible to participate .
 Every month , you deposit part of your salary into your 401k , and the company matches it , tax- free .
 Deposit part of my salary ?
 But the big decision is the asset allocation mix you decide to elect .
 Money market funds , bonds , stocks , large cap , small cap , treasuries .
 You decide the risk profile you 're willing to take , get your elective deferral documents notarized , and you 'll be all set .
 Easy peasy .
 Hey , you 're the helper guy , right ?
 The T. A. , yeah .
 Yeah , I don 't understand my grade on this paper .
 That would be a " D " .
 Yeah , no , thanks , I get that . Um , but why ?
 I mean , I misspelled Tennyson or something ?
 Uh , yeah , I remember this one .
 I graded it .
 Oh , you ... you graded it , not the Professor ?
 Tenured professors don 't grade freshman class survey papers .
 Okay , so if you graded it , what was wrong with it ?
 Uh , it sucked .
 Itit sucked ?
 Um , look , I ... I covered everything the assignment asked for .
 It was facile and glib .
 You danced around and you tried to be clever , but there were no compelling insights or any attempt at original thought .
 Oh , original thought on Byron 's Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ?
 Look , nobody 's had an original thought on Childe Harold since queen Victoria was still getting laid .
 Look , this was crap , okay ? You threw it together .
 You thought nobody would notice , but I noticed .
 Why are you taking this class anyway ?
 Because it was the only freshman English class available after noon .
 Well , look , you got another week to add/ drop before you 're stuck in here , all right ?
 You don 't want to work any harder than this piece of shit ,
 I suggest you find yourself another course .
 Yo , Stan .
 I hear you 're not feeling so good .
 Stan . Stan .
 Hey , what the fuck , man ? He 's dead !
 - Which one ? - Stan ! Stan kopchek !
 Yeah . Sorry for your loss .
 - You family ? - No ... yeah ... sort of .
 Yeah , well , we 're not supposed to tell people over the phone when a patient dies , so we usually just say they ain 't feeling good .
 He 's fucking cold !
 Joaquin , he ain 't never show up for his overnight shift , so we don 't know how long he 's been laying up in there , dead .
 You got a mortuary you need me to call for you ?
 Pick up the body ?
 Hi .
 How 's Frank ? You hear anything out of him ?
 No , no . No , not a peep .
 I got the stuff you wanted , cooking spray , funnel .
 I have these things in my throat that bleed if I try to swallow alcohol , so I have to figure out other ways to get it into my system .
 - You can 't just stop ? - No .
 I get the shakes , very bad . I could die .
 I have to stop drinking slowly , over time .
 So we just hook up this handy- dandy contraption .
 Alcohol goes in this bag , this goes up the poop chute , and voila .
 More than one way to get booze into a Gallagher .
 Do ... do me a favor , will you , son ?
 Go down to the kitchen and see what Fiona 's got down there .
 Beer , wine .
 The hard stuff works best , but anything even remotely flammable will work .
 Hello .
 Ho ... how you doing ?
 Good . You ?
 Good .
 You 're pregnant ? How is that even possible ?
 Well , that 's what I said .
 We can 't afford to have two babies .
 We 're barely gonna be able to afford to have one .
 Have you told Kev yet ? What about your mom ?
 Oh , she gonna have to have an abortion .
 I can 't have her nasty , Kev- mama baby staring up at me , not with my own Kev baby on my hip .
 I 'll just end up hating the mama baby and accidentally on purpose run over it in the driveway .
 It 's Mike .
 He wants me to come over to his place tonight , celebrate my three months at the company .
 Oh , celebrate how , by having you sit on his face ?
 Yeah , something like that .
 You really haven 't slept with him ?
 No , but I probably should soon .
 He 's already well past the whole 2 grand in meals thing for me having to put out .
 You make it sound like a chore .
 I know , it 's crazy , but he 's my boss , you know ?
 I mean , what happens if we break up ?
 You already gave him a hand job .
 I think you long past the " what if we break up " point .
 Yeah , you 're probably right .
 You should go . I 'll keep an eye on the kids .
 - I need the kid practice now . - Yeah , times two .
 All right , well , I 'll be ...
 I 'll be back tomorrow .
 I can tackle this whole kitchen area .
 It may take a few days , but I will make this kitchen my bitch .
 Now , good night .
 You hired Sheila to be your maid ?
 No , she 's just been hanging around .
 I think she 's lonely .
 So when are you gonna tell Kev ?
 Mm , I figured I 'd give it a bit , see if this thing 's still hanging around after a couple of months .
 I haven 't exactly been fertile ground for planting little , baby Kev seedlings .
 You got to tell him , " V. "
 It 's not fair to keep it a secret .
 - Shit . - What are you looking for ?
 I thought we had some wine left .
 Did the two of us finish off an entire gallon of box wine the other night ?
 Hold it up nice and high .
 Okay , open the valve .
 Hey , babe , are you straight ?
 Yeah , I 'm good .
 Come here .
 Oh , Christ .
 Close the damn door !
 Nobody wants to see that mandingo shit .
 Fuck !
 Oh , fuck ! Ah , fuck ! Fuck .
 Are you okay ?
 Yeah .
 I slipped .
 Hurry up . I need to use the toilet .
