 You guys don 't understand . For us , kissing is as important as any part of it .
 Yeah , right !
 You serious ? Oh , yeah !
 AII you need to know is in the first kiss .
 Absolutely .
 For us , kissing 's an opening act . . . . . . Iike the comedian you have to sit through . . . . . . before Pink Floyd comes out .
 And it 's not that we don 't Iike the comedian .
 It 's just that that 's not . . . . . . why we bought the ticket .
 The problem is , after the concert , no matter how great the show was . . . . . . you girls are always Iooking for the comedian again .
 We 're in the car , fighting traffic . . . . . . just trying to stay awake .
 WeIl , word of advice :
 Bring back the comedian .
 Or next time you 'II find yourself Iistening to that album alone .
 Are we stiII talking about sex ? The One With the Sonogram at the End English Subtitles by GELULA & CO . , INC .







 No , it 's good . It is good . It 's just that doesn 't she seem a Iittle angry ?
 WeIl , she has issues .
 Does she ?
 He 's out banging other women with a club . . . . . . while she 's home getting the mastodon smeII out of the carpet .
 Marsha , see , these are cave people .
 Okay , they have issues Iike : " Gee , that glacier 's getting kind of close ! " See ?
 Speaking of issues , isn 't that your ex- wife ?
 Yes , it is .
 Carol , hi ! Okay . Yes , it is .
 I 'II catch up with you in the Ice Age .


 Hi .
 So . . . . You Iook great .
 I hate that .
 Sorry . Thanks .
 You Iook good too .
 WeIl , you know , in here , anyone who . . . . . . stands erect . . . .
 So what 's new ? StiII a --
 A Iesbian ? You never know .
 How 's the family ?
 Marty 's stiII totaIly paranoid .
 Carol , why are you here ?
 I 'm pregnant .
 Pregnant !
 She didn 't leave in such a hurry after all .
 This is the Three 's Company episode where 's there 's a misunderstanding .
 Then I 've already seen this one .
 Are you through with that ? Sorry , the swaIlowing slowed me down .
 Whose baII of paper is this ?
 That 's mine . I wrote a note to myself , then I didn 't need it .
 So I baIled it up and now I wish I was dead .

 She already fluffed that piIlow .
 You already fluffed -- It 's fine .
 I don 't want to give them any more ammunition than they have .
 We know how crueI parents can be . . . . . . about the flatness of a child 's piIlow .
 Monica ? Hi ! Monica , you 're scaring me .
 I mean , you 're aII chaotic and twirly , you know ?
 Not in a good way . Yeah , calm down .
 You don 't see Ross getting chaotic and twirly every time they come .
 That 's because my parents think Ross can do no wrong .
 You see , he 's " The Prince . "
 Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born .
 - What ?
 - Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster .
 - Has anybody seen my engagement ring ?
 - Yeah , it 's beautiful !
 Oh , God ! Oh , God !
 No , don 't touch that .
 Like I wasn 't dreading tomorrow enough having to return it to him .
 " Barry , remember me ?
 I 'm the girl . . . . . . that stomped on your heart in front of your family "
 Now I must return the ring , without the ring . . . . . . which makes it so much harder .
 Easy , we 'II find it . Won 't we ?
 Okay , Iook .
 When did you have it Iast ?
 Doy ! Probably right before she Iost it .
 You don 't get a Iot of " doy " these days .
 I know I had it this morning .
 I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with . . . .
 Dinah ?
 Oh , don 't be mad .
 - You didn 't ! - Oh , I 'm sorry .
 I gave you one job !
 But Iook how straight those noodles are .
 That 's not how you Iook for an engagement ring in a Iasagna .
 I just can 't do it .
 Boys ?
 We 're going in !

 Hi .
 That is not a happy " hi . "
 Carol 's pregnant .
 I found it !

 Yeah . Do that for two hours . . . . . . you might be where I am right about now .
 That puts that whole piIlow thing in perspective .
 How do you fit into this whole thing ?
 CaroI says she and Susan want me to be involved .
 But if I 'm not comfortable with it , I don 't have to be involved .
 BasicaIly , it 's totaIly up to me .
 She is so great . I miss her .
 What does she mean by " involved " ?
 Presumably , the biggest part of your job is done .
 Anyway , they want me to go down to this . . . . . . sonogram thing with them tomorrow .
 What 'II you do ?
 I have no idea .
 No matter what I do , though , I 'm stiII gonna be a father .
 This is stiII ruined , right ?
 Martha Lugwin 's daughter is going to caII you .
 What 's that curry taste ? Curry .
 I think they 're great . I reaIly do .
 Remember the Lugwins ?
 The big one had a thing for you .
 They aII had a thing for him !
 Oh , Mom !
 Why is this girI going to caII me ?
 She just graduated , and she wants to be something in cooking , food . . . . . . or I don 't know .
 I told her you had a restaurant .
 I don 't have a restaurant .
 I work in a restaurant .
 They don 't have to know that .
 Ross , help me with the spaghetti .
 Oh , we 're having spaghetti .
 That 's . . . . . . easy .
 This 'II sound unbelievably selfish on my part . . . . . . but did you plan on bringing up the baby/ Iesbian thing ?
 It 'd take the heat off of me .
 What RacheI did to her Iife !
 We ran into her parents at the club . They were not playing very weIl .
 I won 't say what they spent on that wedding . . . . . . but $40, 000 is a Iot of money .
 At Ieast she had the chance to Ieave a man at the altar .
 What 's that supposed to mean ?
 Nothing . - It 's an expression .
 - No , it 's not . Don 't Iisten to her !
 You 've always been independent .
 Even when you were a kid , and you were chubby . . . . . . and you had no friends , you were just fine .
 You 'd read alone in your room . And your puzzles . . . .
 There are people , Iike Ross , who need to shoot for the stars .
 With his museum and his papers getting published .
 Others are satisfied as they are .
 I 'm teIling you , these are the people who never get cancer .
 I read about women trying to have it aIl , and I thank God . . . . . . our Iittle Harmonica doesn 't have that problem .
 So , Ross , what 's going on with you ?
 Any stories ? No news , no Iittle anecdotes to share with the folks ?

 Look , I realize you guys have been wondering . . . . . . what exactly happened between CaroI and me .
 So here 's the deal .
 Carol 's a Iesbian .
 She 's Iiving with a woman named Susan .
 She 's pregnant with my child .
 And she and Susan are going to raise the baby .
 And you knew about this ?
 Your folks are reaIly that bad ? WeIl , you know , these people are pros .
 They know what they do .
 They take their time . They get the job done !
 Boy , I know they say that you can 't change your parents .
 Boy , if you could , I 'd want yours .
 Must pee !
 It 's worse when you 're twins .
 - You 're a twin ? - Yeah . We don 't speak .
 She 's this high- powered , driven , career- type .
 - What does she do ? - She 's a waitress .
 AII right . You guys , I kind of gotta clean up now .
 Chandler , you 're an only child .
 You don 't have any of this .
 No , although I did have an imaginary friend . . . . . . who my parents preferred .
 Hit the Iights , please .
 How Iong was I in there ?
 I 'm just cleaning up .
 Do you need any help ?
 Okay , sure . Thanks .
 Anyway . . . . So you nervous about Barry tomorrow ?
 A Iittle .
 A Iot .
 So , got any advice ?
 You know , as someone who 's recently been dumped .
 WeIl , you may want to steer clear of the word " dumped . "
 Chances are he 's going to be this broken sheII of a man . You know ?
 You should try not to Iook too terrific .
 I know it 'II be hard .
 You know , I 'II go down there , and I 'II give Barry back his ring .
 And you can go with CaroI and Susan to the OB- G YN .
 You 've got CaroI tomorrow .
 When did it get so complicated ?
 Got me .
 Remember when we were in high schooI together ?
 Didn 't you think you 'd meet someone . . . . . . faII in Iove , and that 'd be it ?


 Man ! I never thought I 'd be here .
 Me neither .
 Sorry I 'm Iate .
 I got stuck at work . There was this big dinosaur thing .
 Anyway . . . .
 Hi .
 - You remember Susan .
 - How could I forget ?

 HeIlo , Susan . Good shake , good shake .
 So we 're just waiting for . . . ?
 - Dr. Oberman . - And is he -- ?
 - She . - Of course , " she . "
 Is she familiar with our speciaI situation ?
 Yes , and she 's very supportive .
 Great !
 Okay , that 's great !
 No , I 'm . . . .
 Thanks .
 That opens my cervix .
 Barry ?
 Come on in .
 Are you sure ? It 's fine , it 's fine .
 Robbie 's gonna be here for hours .
 So how are you doing ?
 I 'm . . . .
 I 'm okay .
 You Iook great .
 Dr. Farber , Jason Greenspan 's gagging .
 Be right there . I 'II be back in a second .
 I dumped him .

 So how 's this going to work . . . . . . you know , with us ?
 You know , when important decisions have to be made ?
 Give me a " for instance . "
 WeIl , I don 't know .
 - How about with the baby 's name ?
 - Marlon . . . . . . if it 's a boy .
 Minnie , if it 's a girl .
 As in " Mouse " ?
 As in my grandmother .
 StiIl , you say " Minnie , " you hear " Mouse . "
 How about . . . .
 How about " Julia " ?
 Julia .
 We agreed on Minnie .
 We agreed we 'd spend our Iives together .
 Things change .
 RoII with the punches .
 I believe Julia 's on the table .
 Sorry about that .
 So what have you been up to ?
 Not much .
 I got a job . That 's great !
 Why are you so tan ?
 I went to Aruba .
 Oh , no ! You went on our honeymoon alone ? No .
 See , I went with . . . . - Now , this may hurt .
 - Me ?
 I went with Mindy .
 Mindy ?
 My maid of honor ?
 We 're kind of a thing now .
 You got plugs !
 Careful , careful .
 They haven 't quite taken yet . And you got Ienses .
 But you hate sticking your finger in your eye .
 Not for her .
 Listen , I reaIly wanted to thank you .
 A month ago , I wanted to hurt you . . . . . . more than I 've ever wanted to hurt anyone .
 And I 'm an orthodontist .
 You know , you were right .
 I thought we were happy .
 We weren 't .
 But with Mindy . . . . . . now I 'm happy .
 - Spit .
 - What ? Me .
 Anyway . . . .
 I guess this belongs to you .
 And thank you for giving it to me .
 WeIl , thank you for giving it back .
 HeIlo !
 Oh , please !
 What 's wrong with Helen ?
 Helen GeIler ?
 I don 't think so !
 It 's not gonna be Helen GeIler .
 Thank you . No . I mean , it 's not GeIler .
 It 'II be Helen WiIlick ?
 ActuaIly , we talked about Helen WiIlick Bunch .
 WeIl , wait a minute . Why is she in the title ?
 It 's my baby too .
 ReaIly ? I don 't remember you making any sperm .
 And we aII know what a chaIlenge that is .
 You two , stop it !
 She gets a credit ! I 'm in there too !
 Not Helen WiIlick Bunch GeIler .
 I think that borders on child abuse . Of course not !
 I 'm suggesting GeIler WiIlick Bunch .
 He knows no one wiII say aII those names .
 They 'II end up caIling her GeIler . Then he gets his way .
 My way ? You think this is my way ?
 Of aII the ways I ever imagined this moment in my Iife being . . . . . . this is not my way .
 You know what ? This is too hard . Knock , knock !
 How are we today ? Any nausea ? - A Iittle .
 - Just a Iittle .
 I was just wondering about the mother- to- be , but thanks for sharing .
 Lie back .
 You know what ? I 'm gonna go .
 I don 't think I can be involved in this particular family thing .
 Oh , my God ! Look at that !
 I know !
 WeIl , isn 't that amazing ?
 What are we supposed to see ?
 I don 't know , but I think it 's about to attack the Enterprise .
 If you tilt your head to the Ieft and relax your eyes . . . . . . it kind of Iooks Iike an old potato .
 Then don 't do that , aII right ?
 What do you think ?
 Are you weIling up ? You are .
 - You are .
 You 're weIling up .
 - I 'm not .
 - You 're going to be an aunt .
 - Oh , shut up !
 Hi , Mindy ! Hi , it 's Rachel .
 Yeah , I 'm fine . I saw Barry today .
 He told me .
 No , it 's okay .
 ReaIly , it 's okay .
 I hope you two are very happy .
 I reaIly do . And , Min , you know , if everything works out . . . . . . and you guys end up getting married and having kids . . . . . . I hope they have his old hairline and your old nose !

 I know it was a cheap shot , but I feeI so much better now !
