 Of course , I am open to requests . That 's right .
 All you gotta do is call me .
 Anytime .
 All right ?
 Bye . Call me .
 Boundaries , Mrs. Nguyen .
 Boundaries . Why are you here ?
 You lose that job already ?
 I should be so lucky . You don 't like your job ?
 Boo- hoo . Poor baby .
 You know , some people work for a living .
 No one gives us free cars . So why you here ?
 This place is paid up .
 I 'm within my rights as your legal tenant .
 That 's all you need to know .
 Do I smell coffee ?
 Have you got a pot on ?
 Why ?
 How about a fill- up ?
 You can afford to buy your own !
 Faster I get coffee , the faster I 'm out of here .

 ladies .

 Son of a ...



 You haven 't unpacked yet ?
 Kevin and Paige are here .
 Absolutely .
 I don 't know exactly what Chuck may have said to you , but just so you know , I did not ask him to step in on my behalf .
 Hi , guys !
 Sorry for the wait .
 Not a problem .
 Hi .
 So good to see you again . Howard .
 Hi , Kim . Good to see you , too !
 Hi , Paige .
 Hi , Kevin . Kim , great to see you .
 Please have a seat . Thank you .
 Kevin , how 's your grandson ?
 Out of control .
 Just running circles around all of us .

 Hello .
 Can I help you ?
 You know why I 'm here ?
 He needs an answer .
 Respectfully , I 'm gonna have to say no .

 You sure about that ?
 I am .

 Your Honor , the defense has made the very reasonable request that the plaintiffs produce their medical records , or barring that , a signed HlPAA release so that we can examine the records ourselves .



 Your Honor , our clients ' medical records have no bearing on the merits of this case .
 The medical records are plainly relevant as they bear directly on our contention that the plaintiffs are not adequate class representatives .
 This is a transparent attempt at intimidation , nothing more .
 How so ?
 Many of our clients have information in their medical records that they prefer to keep private .
 They 're fearful , as any of us would be , at the thought of a bunch of strangers poking around in their personal files .
 And by forcing them to reveal this information , the defense is banking on them simply dropping out of the case .
 Your Honor , this is about class certification . That 's all .
 If the named plaintiffs are suffering from dementia or other mental deficiencies ...
 You 're saying they 're incompetent ?
 I 'm saying we have a right to any record that would speak to their competency as regards this class certification issue .
 Your Honor , it seems like the defense wants it both ways , then .
 If our clients are suffering from dementia , then the residency contracts they signed with Sandpiper couldn 't have been entered into knowingly .

 No . No , that is not what we ...
 The defense wants to claim that their residents are competent enough to be held to their contracts , but too incompetent to sue .
 So which is it ?
 Many of the residents signed their contracts years ago .
 And at the time , they were perfectly competent .
 But that can change , especially when we 're talking about elderly individuals .
 Or maybe Sandpiper preyed on mentally incompetent seniors and bilked them out of their money .
 Ms. Wexler ...
 I am simply trying to defend our clients from bullying by the defense .
 Your Honor , as stated in the brief in front of you , this is a standard request granted in every case of its kind .
 This is not about bullying .
 Granting this invasion of privacy allows our clients to be doubly victimized .
 I ask that you deny the defense 's motion , Your Honor .
 I 'm leaning toward granting the motion , but I would like to review the pleadings and briefs again .
 I 'll have my decision for you shortly .
 Adjourned .

 I 'm gonna meet you back at the office .

 Ms. Wexler ?
 Hey .
 I just wanted to say , good work in there .
 Thanks . But I 'm pretty sure I lost .
 Of course you did . It 's an unwinnable position .
 That 's why your boss didn 't bother showing up .
 But you went down swinging , and I admire that .
 Thank you .
 What are you doing for lunch ?
 Probably just grabbing something from the vending machines .
 Oof .
 We can do better than that .
 Mr. Schweikart .
 Good to see you , sir . How you doing , Sean ? Very well .
 Can I get some drinks for you two ? Your usual Moscow Mule ?
 Absolutely . You want one ?
 Best Moscow Mule in the city .
 Fresh ginger , real copper mug , the works .
 That 's very vintage .
 But I 'm good .
 Just an iced tea . You sure ?
 All right , then .
 I 'll be the sole degenerate who 's drinking in the middle of the workday .
 That , too , is vintage .
 I 'll get those started . So , you 've been with HHM , what ?
 Ten years ? Yeah .
 Last August .
 And you started in the mail room ?
 I did .
 I was six years there . How did you know that ?
 I asked around . It 's a small town .
 It sounds like you certainly paid your dues .
 I was very fortunate .
 HHM put me through law school while I worked .
 That 's great that they foster talent like that .
 And I imagine you 're paying it off as part of your deal ?
 Yeah , happily . It 's a pretty standard arrangement .
 I have to say , watching you in court today , it sure did bring back some old memories for me .
 One in particular , anyway . Yeah ?
 I was a year out of law school at this firm in Boston , and I was finally put on my first big case .
 This huge employment discrimination suit .
 That thing kept us in billing for a decade .
 Anyway , we landed this monster , and I find out I 'm second chair to one of the partners on the preliminary hearing .
 And I think , " This is it ! "
 " This is what will define the rest of my career . "
 So , the hearing 's getting closer and closer .
 I even get this new suit that I can 't afford .
 I split it over three credit cards .
 I 'm probably still paying it off to this day .
 So , I go in bright and early , I 'm wearing my new suit , prepping my table , and in walks the opposing counsel .
 There 's four of them .
 One senior partner and three high- level associates .
 These guys have been litigating longer than I 've been alive . But I think ... "
 " I 'm good , I 've got my boss coming , it 'll be fine . "
 So I 'm sitting alone at my table , waiting for my boss to show .
 And I 'm waiting . And I 'm waiting .
 And then suddenly they 're calling us to order , and I realize that no one from my firm is coming .
 It 's just me .
 So I think , " All right , then .
 This is the moment . " And I get up there and I argue like my life depended on it .
 I 'm sweating and I 'm citing statutes left and right .
 And I 'm doing okay . Respectable .
 But I 'm just a BB gun to these four howitzers .
 And I lose , of course .
 It was inevitable .
 But later , it hit me that my boss never intended to show .
 And they all laughed about it .
 They patted me on the back , said it was my trial by fire .
 And I laughed with them .
 But , you know , it never really sat well with me .
 You want them to have your back .
 Because at the end of the day , it wasn 't about proving my mettle .
 My boss had a tee time that he didn 't want to miss .
 I wasn 't there long .
 Could I ask why we are here ?
 You know , I 've had my eye on you for a while .
 Since that Kettleman thing .
 It was an excellent deal you got for him .
 And I 'm wondering why someone who can put together a deal like that is arguing a losing position with no backup .
 I have no complaints about HHM .
 That 's great . However , if on the off- chance you 're pondering a change ,
 Schweikart & Cokely would be more than happy to put your talents to good use .
 I ...
 Of course we 'd have to have a more formal meeting , work out specifics , but we think you would be a great fit .
 Well , I 'm flattered , but there 's clearly an ethical issue here .
 Well , of course , we 'd take you off Sandpiper .
 And rest assured , we wouldn 't be expecting any information about HHM 's strategy .
 Look , we 're a large , diversified firm .
 And just think what you can do with our resources and the freedom to really spread your wings .
 That 's ...

 I owe a lot to HHM .
 Your tuition debt ?
 We could take care of that .
 That 's very generous .
 Well , give it some time , you think about it .
 And you give me a call , and we 'll set up a meeting with the rest of the senior partners .
 And , to be clear ,
 I 'm talking partner track . Jesus , Sean , did you have to send to Moscow ?
 Sorry for the wait , Mr. Schweikart .
 Are we ready to order ?










 Get down .
 Get down .






 What 's the message ?
 Take the $5, 000 . It took two guys to tell me that ?
 We were just supposed to scare you .
 That 's all .
 Then try harder next time . Get out .



 Get out .





 Hey , Julie .
 Come on in .
 I 've got those Sandpiper documents .
 Great , just put them anywhere .
 Howard asked if you could go through them now . It 's 1 : 15 .
 I was just about to grab some lunch . Yeah .
 He needs them done by 2 : 30 so he can draft a letter .
 I brought these .
 Figured I could petty cash a lunch order for you .
 I got accounting to approve that new fancy salad place .

 Kaylee .
 Kaylee , come on .
 Not too far from the side .
 Throw the ball , Pop- Pop .

 When are we going home ? What ?
 You don 't like it here ?
 It 's okay .
 " It 's okay " ? You 've got a pool .
 What more do you want ? I guess .
 You guess ?
 You guess ? Well ...
 You want to come out of there ?
 No ! I 'm staying .
 Well , you want me to come in there and get you ?
 I can 't have you in a pool that 's only " okay . "
 It 's good !
 It 's good !

 You sure ?
 You sure ?
 I 'm sure !
 Kaylee , honey , it 's time to come out now .
 Just a few more minutes ! No .
 You do what Pop- Pop says .
 Come on , baby , before you turn into a prune .

 Miss ?
 The gentleman would like me to let you know that your next drink is on him .
 Just let me know when you 're ready .

 I 'm ready .
 I wasn 't sure that was gonna work .
 Don 't tell me that 's the first time you 've done that .
 So , what kind of return on investment are you getting on these drinks ?
 None as pretty as you .
 Man .

 I 'm Dale , by the way .
 Giselle .
 Okay , item number 44 , what do we have ?
 Residency contract for Abigail Hildreth .
 " Abigail Hildreth . "
 And what 's the date on that ? Dated August 1st , 1999 .
 August 1st , 1999 .
 August 1st , 1999 .
 And do we have the corresponding deposition for Mrs. Hildreth ?
 Yes .
 Have you ever heard the expression , " A watched pot never boils " ?

 Here it is . Thank you .
 See ? I 've got her down as item 12 .
 Date of depo , September 15th .
 September 15th . Fifteenth of September .

 September 15th .
 Or yeah , September 15th .
 Thank you .
 Okay , item number 45 .

 Jimmy ? It 's my grandma .
 She 's old .
 I 'll be right back .

 Kim ?

 Santa Fe downtown ?
 Why ?
 I 'm at the bar at Forque .
 And I 've got a live one on the hook .
 I 'm on my way .
 What 's the shot ?
 Definitely two or three .
 You don 't think they do ?
 They could .
 I know , but they don 't have to .
 That 's possible , but I don 't understand why that 's an issue .
 You can always go back . Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Viktor ! There you are ! So sorry I 'm late .
 I had to put out a few fires .
 No problem . I made a new friend . Dale , my brother Viktor .
 Hey , how you doing ? Nice to meet you , Dale .
 Thanks for keeping sis company .
 My pleasure .
 You need a drink . Let 's get you a drink .
 So , what do you do , Dale ?
 I 'm an engineer .
 Like Casey Jones , with the hat ?
 No , idiot .
 An engineer- engineer .
 Not an " engineer . " Dale builds things .
 I design things . Spillways and drainage fields , mostly .
 I don 't actually build them .
 Well , that 's cool .
 Yeah .
 But you could still wear the hat , though .
 Right ?
 Nothing stopping you . Yeah , I guess I could .
 I 'm just saying there 's no rule about that , as far as I know .
 You are such a brat !
 Why the good mood ?
 Did it go well today ?
 Please tell me it went well .
 Yeah , it went well . Very well ?
 Like , very , very ? Beyond our wildest ...
 Yeah .
 Whoo !
 How many of these has she had ?
 I 'm just getting started , baby ! Remember these faces , Dale ! Giselle .
 They 're gonna be on the cover of January issue .
 Giselle . Please . Dale 's a good guy .
 He 's not gonna do anything . You 're boring the man .
 No , no , not really .
 Thank you . All right , I 'm off to the little girl 's room .
 Say only nice things about me while I 'm gone , okay ?
 She 's something .
 Yeah .
 So , Giselle was telling me you two are starting a business ?
 What exactly did she tell you ?
 Nothing much .
 Just something about a dotcom .
 Some way for people to hook up with each other using the Internet ?
 Look , I 'm sure you 're a nice guy , but she was talking out of school .
 We 're full up on this thing .
 Okay .
 We sign one more investor , we gotta go public .
 And I 'm just ...
 No . We cannot take anyone else on .
 No offense .
 It 's okay .
 Yeah .
 No worries .

 Spread your arms .


 No .

 He 's got a gun .
 I don 't care about the gun .
 Tomorrow , you go to the district attorney .
 And you explain to him that my nephew 's gun was yours .
 The DA will ask you , " Why you didn 't say anything before ? "
 You tell him you forgot .
 You were rattled .
 Make up anything you want , I don 't give a shit .
 But it 's your gun .
 Let 's discuss my payment .
 That time has passed .
 No $5, 000 for you .
 The price is $50, 000 .
 How about your payment is you get to live ?
 Not enough . You think you can negotiate with me ?
 I say the word , my nephews go to a certain motel .
 Pay a visit to your daughter- in- law and your little granddaughter .
 What do you think happens then ? Consider your position carefully .

 I get my money , or neither of us walk out of here .
 You 're willing to die for this ?
 Maybe I need the $50, 000 more than you do .


 How you manage to live so long with a mouth like that ?
 $50, 000 .
 And the gun is yours .

 He sent you ?
 I volunteered .
 Only safe way for us to talk .
 You really pushed it in there .
 That thing we did ?
 He finds out , we 're both dead .
 You get that , right ?
 What thing we did ?

 What 's this ? $25, 000 .
 What for ? We made a deal .
 I didn 't hold up my end .
 Your problem is coming back sooner than we expected .

 You gonna cash that ?
 I might know a guy who can help .
 It 's better as a souvenir .
 I figured you 'd be , maybe , I don 't know , a touch happier this morning .
 Maybe a smidge ?
 Possibly ? I am . I 'm totally happy .
 Why wouldn 't I be ?
 I ...
 I had a job offer .
 Really ?
 From where ? Schweikart & Cokely .
 Seriously ?
 Rich Schweikart said that they would even pay off my law school loans .
 That 's great ! Please let me be there when you tell Howard .
 Please .
 So why the sad puppy eyes ? What , you don 't want that job ?
 No , no , of course I do .
 I mean , who wouldn 't , right ?
 It 's a huge firm .
 You get out from under Howard 's thumb .
 Right .
 Exactly .
 Besides , HHM is looking more and more like a dead end for me anyway .
 Exactly .
 So what 's the problem ?

 I just ...
 I don 't know .
 I keep thinking of you floating in that pool .
 You knew what you wanted , but I got in the way .
 What are you talking about ?
 You took the Davis & Main job because of me .
 I took that job because it was the right decision .
 A steady pay check ? Done .
 A place to live that 's more than , five square feet ? Boom .
 A car that 's all one color ? Nailed it .
 I 'm good .
 I got what I wanted .
 And you ? With this Schweikart thing ?
 You could have everything you ever wanted .
 What 's not to love about that ?
 Yeah .
 What 's not to love ?
