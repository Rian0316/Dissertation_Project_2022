 Chandler ?
 Miss Tedlock , you 're Iooking Iovely today .
 May I say that is a very flattering sleeve Iength on you ?

 Mr. Costilick would Iike you to stop by his office at the end of the day .
 If this is about those prank memos , I had nothing to do with them .
 Nothing at aIl .
 ReaIly .
 Nothing .

 Hey , you guys ! You guys ! Chandler 's coming and he says he has incredible news .
 So when he gets here , Iet 's aII act , Iike , you know --
 Never mind .
 But it was gonna be reaIly good .
 What 's going on ?
 So it 's a typicaI day at work .
 I 'm inputting my numbers . . . . . . and Big AI teIls me he wants to make me processing supervisor .
 - That is great ! - Congratulations !
 So . . . . . . I quit .
 Why ?
 Why ? This was supposed to be a temp job .
 Chandler , you 've been there for five years .
 I know , but if I took it , it would be admitting that this is what I do .
 Was it a Iot more money ? Doesn 't matter .
 I just don 't want to be a guy who sits in his office . . . . . . worrying about the WENUS .
 " The WENUS ? "
 Weekly estimated net usage system .
 It 's a processing term . Oh , that WENUS . What are you gonna do ?
 I don 't know .
 That 's the thing . But I won 't figure it out working there .
 I have something you can do !
 I have this new massage client , Steve .
 Anyway , he 's opening up a restaurant . . . . . . and he 's Iooking for a head chef .
 Hi , there .
 I know .
 You 're a chef , I know , and I thought of you first .
 But Chandler 's the one who needs a job right now , so . . . .
 I just don 't have a Iot of chefing experience .
 Unless it 's an aIl- toast restaurant .
 What kind of food is he Iooking for ?
 He wants to do something eclectic , so he 's Iooking for someone . . . . . . who can create the entire menu .
 - Oh , my God ! - Yeah , I know !
 So what do you think ? Thanks .
 I just don 't see myself in a big white hat .

 Oh , Monica ! Guess what ?
 Can you see my nipples through this shirt ?
 No , but don 't worry . I 'm sure they 're stiII there .
 Where you going , Mr. Suit- ey Man ?
 I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pilman , career counselor- a- go- go !
 I added the " a- go- go . "
 Career counselor ?
 Hey , you guys aII know what you want to do . I don 't .
 Hey , you guys in the Iiving room aII know what you want to do .
 You know , you have goals , you have dreams .

 Brian 's Song !
 The meeting went great ? So great !
 He showed me where the restaurant 's gonna be .
 It 's this cute Iittle place on 1 0th . It 's not too big , not too smaIl . It 's just right .
 Was it formerly owned by a blond woman and some bears ?
 Anyway , I 'm cooking for him Monday night .
 Kind of an audition .
 He wants you to be here , which wiII be great for me .
 You can make yummy noises .
 - What are you gonna make ? - Yummy noises .
 And , Monica , what are you gonna make ?
 I don 't know . It 's just got to be great .
 I know what you can make ! I know !
 You should make that thing with the stuff . You know . . . . . . that thing with the stuff ? Okay , I don 't know .
 Anyone know a good date place in the neighborhood ?
 How about Tony 's ?
 If you can finish a 32- ounce steak , it 's free .
 Anyone know a good place if you 're not dating a puma ?
 - Who are you going out with ? - Is this the bug Iady ?
 I love you , Ross . Her name 's Celia .
 She 's not a bug Iady .
 She 's curator of insects at the museum .
 What are you gonna do ?
 I thought we 'd go to dinner , then bring her back to my place . . . . . . and I 'd introduce her to my monkey .
 He 's not speaking metaphoricaIly .
 So back to your place ? You thinking maybe . . . .
 WeIl , I don 't know . . . .
 I 'm hoping . . . .
 I teII you , that monkey 's a chick magnet .

 It 's creamier . Yeah ?
 WeIl , is that better ?
 I don 't know . We 're talking about whipped fish .
 I 'm just happy I 'm keeping it down .
 God , what happened to you ?
 Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests . . . . . . inteIligence tests , personality tests , and what do I Iearn ?
 " You 're suited for data processing for a Iarge multi nationaI corporation . "
 That 's so great because you already know how to do that !
 Can you believe it ?
 Don 't I seem Iike I should be doing something reaIly cool ?
 You know , I just always pictured myself doing something . . . . Something !
 Oh , Chandler , I know , I know .
 You can see your nipples through this shirt .
 Here you go . Maybe this wiII cheer you up .
 I had a grape about five hours ago , so I better split this with you .
 It 's supposed to be that smaIl .

 The French caII it an amuse- bouche .
 WeIl , it is amusing .
 Oh , hi , Wendy . Yeah , 8 : 00 .
 What did we say , $ 1 0 an hour ? Okay , great .
 AII right , I 'II see you then . Bye .
 Ten doIlars an hour for what ?
 I asked a waitress at work to help me out .
 Waitressing ?
 Of course I thought of you .
 But . . . . But . . . .
 But , but . . . .
 But , you see , it 's just this thing has to go just perfect , you know . . . . . . and , weIl , Wendy 's more of a professionaI waitress .
 And I 'm maintaining my amateur status so I can waitress in the Olympics .

 You know , I don 't mean to brag , but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '7 6 .
 Amuse- bouche ?
 Talk to me .
 A weird thing happened to me on the train this morning --
 Talk dirty .

 " Vulva ? "
 AII right , I panicked , aII right ?
 She took me by surprise .
 But it wasn 't a totaI Ioss .
 I mean , we ended up cuddling .
 Whoa , you cuddled ? How many times ?
 Shut up . It was nice .
 I just don 't think I 'm the dirty- talking kind of guy .
 Just say what you want to do to her .
 Or what you want her to do to you .
 Or what you think other people might be doing to each other .
 Look , I teII you what . Try something on me .
 Please be kidding . Why not ?
 Come on .
 Just close your eyes and teII me what you 'd Iike to be doing right now .

 Come on . You Iike this woman ?
 - You wanna see her again ? - Sure .
 If you can 't talk dirty to me , how wiII you talk dirty to her ?

 And again !
 Hey , Mr. Costilick . How 's Iife on the 1 5th floor ?
 Yeah , I miss you too .
 It 's a Iot Iess satisfying to steaI pens from your own home . That 's very generous .
 But Iook , this isn 't about the money .
 I need something more than a job .
 I need something I reaIly care about --
 That 's on top of the year- end bonus structure ? - Your dream !
 - Your dream ! Look , Al .
 Al , I 'm not playing hardbaII here , okay ?

 That 's too bad .
 Bye- bye .

 Lit a bone . Weed , hemp , ganja .

 Okay , I 'm with you , Cheech .
 Is it dry in here ?
 Let me get you some wine .

 It 's just I just thought that this was , you know , " it . "
 You 'II get there .
 You 're an amazing chef . You know those yummy noises ?
 I wasn 't faking .

 So how did it go with Celia ?
 I was unbelievable . AII right , Ross !
 I was the James Michener of dirty talk .
 It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard .
 I mean , there were characters , plot Iines . . . . . . themes , a motif .
 At one point , there were viIlagers . And . . . .
 WeIl , by the time we finished with aII the dirty talk . . . . . . it was Iate and we were both exhausted , so . . . .
 - You cuddled . - Yeah , which was nice .
 Do you guys want to try to catch a Iate movie ? Shouldn 't we wait for Chandler ?
