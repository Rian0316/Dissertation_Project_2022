 This is unbelievable ! It 's been half an hour .
 If this was a cartoon , you 'd look like a ham about now .
 There 's the waitress . Excuse me ! - Hello , miss ?
 - It 's Phoebe !
 Okay , will that be all ? Wait , wait . What are you doing here ?
 I was over there ... ... then you said , " Excuse me , miss . "
 So now I 'm here . How come you 're working here ?
 Because it 's close to where I live , and the aprons are really cute .
 Can we start over ? Okay , great . I 'm gonna be over here .
 The One With the Two Parts - Part I

 I don 't know if he 's testing me or just acting out ... ... but my monkey is out of control !
 He keeps erasing the messages on my machine .
 Supposedly by accident .
 Yeah , I 've done that .
 And three days in a row , he got to the newspaper before I did ... ... and peed all over the crossword !
 I 've never done that .
 And then last night , I don 't know what he did , but there were capers everywhere .
 Allright now look at her and tell me she doesn 't look exactly like her sister . I 'm saying I see a difference .
 They 're twins .
 I don 't care . Phoebe 's Phoebe .
 Ursula 's hot .
 You know that thing when we talk about things ?
 Let 's not do that anymore .
 Hey , Pheebs . Guess who we saw today ? Oh , fun !
 - Liam Neeson . - No .
 Morley Safer .
 The woman who cuts my hair ! This could be a really long game .
 Your sister , Ursula . Oh , really ?
 She works at that place ...
 Riff 's . Yeah , I know .
 You do ? She said you guys haven 't talked in years .
 So is she fat ?
 Not from where I was standing .
 Where were you standing ?
 Pheebs , so you guys just don 't get along ?
 It 's mostly just dumb sister stuff , you know ?
 Everyone always thought of her as the pretty one .
 She was the first to walk ... ... even though I did it later that same day .
 To my parents , by then it was , " Yeah , what else is new ? "
 I 'm sorry . I 've gotta go . I 've got Lamaze class .
 And I 've got earth science , but I 'll catch you in gym ?
 Is this just gonna be you and Carol ? Susan will be there too .
 We 've got dads , we 've got lesbians . The whole parenting team .
 Isn 't that gonna be weird ?
 It might have been at first ... ... but now I 'm comfortable with the situation .
 Ross , that 's my jacket . I know .
 We 're the Rostens . I 'm J. C. And he 's Michael .
 And we 're having a boy and a girl .
 Good for you !
 Alrighty , next ?
 I 'm Ross Geller . And that 's my boy in there .
 And this is Carol Willick , and this is Susan Bunch .
 Susan is Carol 's ...
 Who 's next ?
 Sorry I didn 't get it , Susan is ... ?
 - Susan is Carol 's friend . - Life partner .
 Like buddies .
 Like lovers . You know how close women can get .
 - Susan and I live together . - I was married to her .
 - Carol , not me . - It 's a little complicated .
 - But we 're fine . - Absolutely .
 So , twins ! That 's like two birds .

 - To you too , Helen !
 Okay , send her in .
 - Come on in . - You wanted to see me ?
 I was just going over your data . You 've been postdating your Friday numbers .
 Which is bad , because ... ?
 It throws my WENUS out of whack .
 I wouldn 't want to do anything to hurt your ... ... WENUS . Excuse me ?
 WENUS .
 Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics . Right .
 Gotcha , gotcha .
 Won 't happen again .

 It 's not just that she 's cute , okay ?
 It 's just that ... ... she 's really , really cute .
 It doesn 't matter . You don 't dip your pen in the company ink .
 God , even I know that , and I 'm pretty much unemployable .
 Ross . Your little creature 's got the remote again .
 Marcel , give Rossy the remote .
 Marcel !
 Marcel , you give Rossy the remote right now !
 You give Rossy the remote ...
 - Great . - Relax .
 I 'll fix it .
 Oh , cool . Urkel ... ... in Spanish is Urkel .
 How did he do this ?
 Is leaving the Christmas lights up ... ... your plan to keep us merry all year long ?
 Someone was supposed to take them down around New Year 's ... ... but obviously someone forgot !
 Someone was supposed to write :
 " Rach , take down the lights " and put it on the refrigera ...
 How long has that been there ?
 Where you been ? I went to Riff 's .
 I think Ursula likes me . All I ordered was coffee .
 She brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries .
 Score .
 She is so hot !
 Okay , before you do anything Joey- like ... ... you might want to run it by ...
 Pheebs ?
 Would it be okay if I asked out your sister ?
 Why ? Why would you want to do that ?
 Why ?
 So that if we went out on a date , she 'd be there .
 Well , I mean , I 'm not my sister 's , you know ... ... whatever .
 And I mean , it 's true , we were one egg once . But , you know , we 've grown apart , so ...
 I don 't know . Why not ?
 Cool . Thanks .
 You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine .
 Do you wanna watch " Laverne y Shirley " ?
 Sorry .
 Sorry I 'm late . Where 's Carol ?
 Stuck at school . Some parent- teacher thing .
 You can go . I 'll get the information .
 No , I think I should stay . We should both know what 's going on .
 Oh , good . This will be fun .
 We 're gonna start with some basic third- stage breathing exercises .
 Mommies , get on your back .
 And , coaches , you should be supporting Mommy 's head .
 - What ? - What ?
 I 'm supposed to be the mommy ? Okay , I 'm gonna play my sperm card one more time .
 I have to miss out on the coaching training because I 'm a woman ?
 So what do you propose to do ? - I 'll flip you for it .
 - Flip me for it ? Heads , heads , heads !
 On your back , Mom !
 All right , Mommies , take a nice , deep , cleansing breath .
 Good .
 Now imagine your vagina is opening ... ... like a flower .
 Mr. Dee ! How 's it going , sir ? It 's been better .
 The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in .
 It 's pretty ugly .
 We haven 't seen an ANUS this bad since the '70s .
 What 's it mean ? We 'll be laying off people .
 I know I was late last week . I slept funny and my hair was snarly .
 Not you . Relax .
 Ever have to fire anyone ?
 No , but that 's not a problem sir , that 's why my name 's on the door .
 By the way , do you know when I 'm getting my name on the door ?
 I don 't know . I ... put it in " the thing " .
 So ... who 's it gonna be ?
 Nina ...
 Nina .
 Nina ?
 Ninaaaa ....
 Are you okay ?
 Yes . Yes , I am .
 Listen , the reason that I called you in here today was ...
 Please don 't hate me .
 What ?
 Would you like to have dinner sometime ?
 So Pheebs , what do you want for your birthday ?
 What I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me .
 Let me put it this way . Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn ?
 Bath salts would be nice ! Good .
 What is this place ?
 You 're cold , I have to pee , and there 's coffee . How bad could it be ?
 I think we have an answer .
 What 's she doing here ?
 This could be God 's way of telling us to eat at home .
 - Think she got fired at Riff 's ? - No , we were there last night .
 She kept bringing swordfish . Are you gonna go ... ?
 I 'll wait until we order . It 's her , right ? It looks like her .
 Excuse me ?
 Hi , it 's us !
 Right .
 And it 's me !
 So you 're here too ? As much as you are .
 Your turn .
 We know what we want . That 's good .
 - Two caffe lattes . - And some biscotti cookies .
 Good choice .
 It 's definitely her .
 I can 't believe you . You still haven 't told that girl she doesn 't have a job ?
 You still haven 't taken down the Christmas lights .
 Congratulations ! I think you found the world 's thinnest argument .
 Trying to find the right moment .
 That shouldn 't be so hard , now that you 're dating .
 " Sweetheart , you 're fired . But how about a quickie before I go to work ? "
 Once you 're inside , you don 't have to knock anymore .
 I 'll get it .
 Hi , Mr. Heckles . You 're doing it again .
 We 're not doing anything . We 're just sitting around talking quietly .
 I can hear you through the ceiling .
 My cats can 't sleep .
 You don 't even have cats . I could have cats .
 Goodbye , Mr. Heckles . We 'll try to keep it down .
 Phoebe , can you do me a favor ? Try this on to make sure it fits .
 My first birthday present ! Oh , this is really ...
 No no no , it 's for Ursula . I just figured , you know , size- wise .
 Sure . Yeah . Okay , it fits .
 Are you seeing her again ? Yep , Ice Capades .
 This is serious . I 've never known you to pay money for any kind of " capade " .
 I don 't know . I like her .
 She 's different . There 's something about her ...
 That you like . We get it . You like her .
 Phoebe , I asked you and you said it was okay .
 Well , maybe now it 's not okay .
 Well , maybe now I 'm not okay with it not being okay .
 Knit , good woman . Knit ! Knit !
 And that 's the Chrysler Building right there .
 Mr. Douglas .
 Cool tie .
 She 's still here .
 Yes . Yes , she is . Didn 't I memo you ?
 After I let her go , I got a call from her psychiatrist , Dr. Flanen ... ... Dr. Flanan , Dr. Flan .
 And he informed me that she took the news rather badly .
 In fact , he mentioned the word " frenzy " .
 She seems so ... Oh , no , no .
 Nina ?
 She 's ...
 In fact , if you asked her now ... ... she 'd have no recollection of being fired at all .
 That 's unbelievable . And yet believable .
 So I decided not to fire her again ... ... until I 'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others .
 I see . You never really know what 's going on inside a person 's head .
 Well , I guess that 's why they call it psychology , sir .


 Lights , please . And that 's having a baby .
 Next week is our final class .
 Susan , go deep .
 It 's impossible . It 's just impossible .
 What is , honey ?
 What that woman ... ... did .
 I am not doing that ! It 'll have to stay in , that 's all .
 Everything will be the same . - It 'll just stay in .
 - Carol , honey . - Everything will be all right . - What do you know ?
 No one 's saying to you , " Hi , is that your nostril ? Mind if we push this pot roast through it ? ! "
 Carol , sweetie . Cleansing breath .
 I know it 's frightening . But big picture :
 The birth part is just one day ... ... and when it 's over , we 'll all be parents for the rest of our lives .
 I mean , that 's what this is all about , right ? Ross ?
 Ross .
 I 'm gonna be a father .
 - This is just occurring to you ? - I knew I was having a baby .
 I just never realized the baby was having me .
 You 're gonna be great . How could you say that ?
 I can 't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat .
 How am I gonna raise a kid ?
 You know , some scientists are now saying ... ... that monkeys and babies are actually different .
 You might wonna look into it ...
 - Where are you going ? - Out .
 With ... ?
 Yes !
 Alright , can I just ask you one question ?
 Have you two , you know , like , you know ?
 You know ? Yet ?
 Well , not that it 's any of your business , but ... ... no , we haven 't .
 Okay ?
 You meant sex , right ?
 - Do you have a sec ? - Sure , Nina . What 's up ?
 I don 't know , for the past couple of days , people have been avoiding me ... ... and giving me strange looks .
 Oh , well , maybe that 's because ... ... they 're jealous of us .
 Maybe . But that doesn 't explain why they keep taking my scissors .
 Well , maybe that 's because you 're getting a big raise !
 - I am ? - Sure . Why not ?
 Oh , my God ! You 're amazing !
 Oh , you don 't know .
 Helen , make sure we do the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder 's raise .

 Helen drinks .
 Will you marry me ?
 - After the proposal , I kind of unreveled .
 Right , because you were really in control up untill then .
 - Yeah , well , I ended up telling her everything . - Oh , how 'd she take it ?
 Pretty well . Except for the stapler thing .
 If you 're ever in a similar situation ... ... never , ever leave your hand on the desk .
 Little tip .
 Okay , I think I get how to do this .
 Can we turn this off ? Can we make them go away ? Because I can 't watch .
 They 're gone .
 Are you all right ?
 Yeah . It 's just this whole stupid Ursula thing .
 Okay Pheebs , can I ask ... ? So he 's going out with her . Is it really so terrible ?
 Yeah .
 I mean , I 'm not saying she 's evil or anything .
 She 's just , you know , she 's always breaking my stuff .
 When I was 8 , I wouldn 't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos ... ... so she threw it under the bus .
 And then when I was twelve and she broke my colar bone .
 Alright , she didn 't mean to do it . But I think it still counts .
 And then there 's Randy Brown ... ... who was like ...
 Have you ever had a boyfriend who was your best friend ?
 Well , but that 's what he was for me .
 And she , you know , kind of stole him away ... ... and then broke his heart .
 And then he wouldn 't even talk to me anymore .
 He didn 't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us .
 I mean , I know Joey 's not my boyfriend or my thermos ... ... or anything , but ...
 - You won 't lose him . - You gotta talk to Joey . Yeah , okay .
 He doesn 't know this stuff . If he knew how you felt ... He 's falling in love with her .
 They 've been going out a week .
 They haven 't even slept together yet . I mean , that 's not serious .

 May we help you ?
 What are you doing ? It 's freezing ! Would you come inside ?
 No , no , no .
 You wanted me to take them down ... ... so I 'm taking them down , okay ?

 Rachel !
 I 'm okay . I 'm okay .
 Mr. Heckles ?
 Mr. Heckles , could you help me , please ?
 This is just the kind of thing I was talking about .
 My friend was taking down our Christmas lights ... ... and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her ankle .
 My God , you still have your Christmas lights up ?
 Fill this out and bring it back to me . Here you go .
 All right . Name ... ... address ...
 Okay , are you currently on any medication ? No .
 Oh , wait wait yes ! Blistex .
 Ah , NO ! In case of emergency , call ... ?
 You .
 Really ?
 Oh , that is so sweet !
 Oh , gosh . I love you . Okay , insurance ?
 Yeah , check it . Definitely gonna want some of that !
 You don 't have insurance ? Why ? How much is this gonna cost ?
 I have no idea , but X- rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars !
 - What 'll we do ? - There 's not much we can do .
 Unless I use yours .
 Now wait a second .
 Who did I just put as my " in case of emergency " person ?
 That 's insurance fraud .
 All right then , forget it . Might as well just go home .
 - Okay , come here . I hate this . - Thank you .
 I love you . I 'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
 Why ? I am really an idiot !
 I was filling out my friend 's form ... ... and instead of putting her information ... ... I put mine .
 You are an idiot .
 Yep , that 's me . I am that stupid .
 I had a dream that I was playing football with my kid .
 That 's nice . No , no .
 With him .
 I 'm on this field , and they hike me the baby .
 I 've gotta do something because the Tampa Bay team 's coming right at me !
 Tampa Bay 's got a terrible team .
 Right , but ... ... it is just me and the baby , so I 'm thinking they can take us .
 And so , I ... ... I just heave it downfield !
 What are you , crazy ? That 's a baby ! He should take the sack ?
 Anyway ... ... suddenly I 'm downfield .
 And I realize that I 'm the one who 's suppose to catch him , right ?
 Only I know I 'm not gonna get there in time .
 So I am running and I 'm running ... ... and that is when I woke up .
 See , I am so not ready to be a father .
 Hey , you 're gonna be fine .
 You 're one of the most caring , responsible men in North America .
 You 're gonna make a great dad .
 Yeah , Ross . You and the baby just need better blocking .
 Have you ever been to the Rainbow Room ? Is it expensive ?
 Only if you order stuff .
 I 'm taking Ursula tonight . It 's her birthday .
 - What about Phoebe 's birthday ?
 - When 's that ?
 Tonight . Man , what are the odds of that happening ?
 You take your time .
 There it is !
 So , what are you gonna do ? What can I do ?
 I don 't want to screw it up with Ursula .
 And your friend , Phoebe ?
 If she 's my friend , she 'll understand . Wouldn 't you guys ?
 If you tried that on my birthday ... ... you 'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit .
 An added pinch of saffron makes all the difference .
 Monica ? Yes ?
 Yes , she is . This is my friend , Rachel .
 Hi Rachel , I 'm Dr. Mitchell . And I 'm his friend , Dr. Rosen .
 I 'm Okay here . actually , that 's alright .
 I don 't mind at all , now you can take your break .

 Aren 't you a little cute to be a doctor ? Excuse me ?
 I meant , god , young , young . I meant young . Young to be a doctor .
 - Good , Rach .
 - Thank you .
 So he said it was a sprain , and that was it .
 You left out the stupid part . It 's not stupid .
 The very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night , and I said yes .
 I think it 's totally insane . They work for the hospital .
 It 's like returning to the scene of the crime .
 - I say we blow off the dates . - What ? Monica , they are cute .
 They are doctors . Cute doctors . Doctors who are cute .
 All right , what have we learned so far ?
 Oh , God .
 Surprise !
 What are you doing ? You scared the crap out of me !
 - Was that the cake ? - Yeah . I got a lemon schmush .
 Come on . She 'll be here any minute .
 I hope it 's okay .
 " Happy Birthday , Peehee . "
 Maybe we can make a " B " out of a rose .
 Yeah , we 'll just use our special cake tools .
 - What 's going on ? - We just ...
 Surprise !
 This is so great ! This was not at all scary .
 Oh look , " happy birthday Peehee " .
 What a strange new nickname . I like it !
 Oh my god ! Hi , everybody . Hi , Betty !
 Betty , hi !
 You found Betty ! Oh , my gosh ! This is so great .
 Everybody I love is in the same room . Where 's Joey ?
 Did you see Betty ?
 I 'll tell you one thing , I wouldn 't mind having a piece of this sun- dried tomato business .
 Five years ago , if somebody 'd said , " Here 's a tomato that looks like a prune " ... ... I 'd have said , " Get out of my office ! "
 Dad , before I was born , did you freak out at all ?
 I 'm not freaking out ! I 'm just saying ... ... if someone had come to me with the idea ...
 I 'm talking about the whole baby thing .
 Did you ever get this sort of ... ... panicky , " Oh , my God , I 'm gonna be a father " kind of a thing ?
 We just had kids back then .
 We didn 't think about it . What else could the sun dry ? I wonder .

 Right , look . Your mother really did the work . I was busy with the business .
 I wasn 't around that much . Is that what this is about ? No , no .
 I was just wondering .
 Cause there 's time to make up for that . We can do stuff together .
 You always wanted to go to colonial Williamsburg . How about we do that ?
 Thanks , Dad , really . You know , I just , I just ...
 I just needed to know ... ... when did you start to feel like a father ?
 Well , I guess it must have been the day after you were born .
 We were in the hospital room , your mother was asleep ... ... and they brought you in and gave you to me .
 You were this ugly little red thing !
 And all of a sudden , you grabbed my finger with your whole fist ... ... and you squeezed it ... ... so tight .
 And that 's when I knew .
 So you don 't want to go to Williamsburg ?
 We can go to Williamsburg .
 Eat your fish .
 Rachel , the cute doctors are here ! Okay , coming .
 Hi , come on in . Hey , Michael , Jeffrey .
 Here , we brought wine .
 Look at this . It 's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine .
 - How could we resist ? - Oh , that 's great , look at that !
 - So , Monica , how 's the ankle ?
 - It 's ...
 Why don 't you tell them ? After all , it is your ankle .
 You know , what ? It 's feeling a lot better . Thank you .
 listen , why don 't you guys sit down , and we 'll get you some glasses .
 Stat !
 Okay , listen , I 'm thinking why don 't we just tell them who we really are ? - I mean it 'll be fine . I really think it will be fine .
 - It will not be fine . We 'll get in trouble . Mnica , would you stop being such a wuss !
 A wuss ? Excuse me for living in the real world .
 - So ? - So they still seem normal .
 That 's because they are .
 Okay , but you have to admit that every time we go out with women we meet at the hospital it turns into ...
 Would you relax ? Take a look around . There are no pagan altars .
 No piles of bones in the corners . They 're fine .
 Go like this :
 I said we are not going to do it , okay ? Sometimes you can be such a big baby !
 - I am not a baby . - Be serious . - You get uptight ...
 - You act like a princess . You know what ?
 You know what ?
 Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother . Excuse me .
 Here we go .
 This is a great place . How long have you lived here ? Thanks .
 I 've been here about six years .
 And Rachel moved in a few months ago .
 See , I was supposed to get married ... ... but I left the guy at the altar .
 Yeah , I know it 's pretty selfish , but ... ... hey , that 's me !
 Why don 't you try the hummus ? So , Monica , what do you do ?
 I am a chef at a restaurant uptown .
 Good for you . Yeah , it is .
 Mostly because I get to boss people around , which I just love to do .
 Well , this hummus is great . God bless the chickpea .
 Oh , God ! I am so spoiled !
 That 's it .
 I shoplift .
 That was years ago and you had no idea that lipstick was in your pocket .
 Did I tell you that I think I 'm so much cuter than I am ?
 And have I mentioned that back in high school ... ... I was a cow ?
 I used to wet my bed .
 I use my breasts to get other people 's attention .
 We both do that !
 Monica and Rachel 's apartment .
 Just one second .
 Rachel , it 's your dad .
 Hi , Dad . No , no . It 's me .
 Listen , Dad , I can 't talk right now .
 But there 's something ...
 There 's something I 've been meaning to tell you .
 Excuse me . Remember back in freshman year ?
 Well , Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed .
 Daddy ...
 Daddy , daddy why ? Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin ?
 His father tried to put you out of business ! You are dead !
 Hey , Rachel , are these your condoms ?
 Oh , no . No , that was just Monica . She 's drunk again .
 Ah , Pheebs , I don 't think scrunchy is a word .
 Why not ? If crunchy is a word , why isn 't scrunchy ?
 Well , okay , then I 'm using that same argument for fligament .
 Ross , he 's got the remote again . Good .
 Maybe he can switch it back .
 Maybe not .
 Okay , daddy , that 's the other line .
 Okay , no . Not even in my bedroom .
 Okay , okay . Bye- bye .
 Hello ?
 Hold on a second and let me just check and see if she 's here .
 It 's the woman from the hospital . There 's a problem with the form .
 Oh , God , what do we do ? Just find out what they want .
 Okay . No , you do it .
 Hello . This is Monica .
 Yes , we 'll be right down .
 Thank you .
 We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms .
 - You 're right , this wasn 't worth it . - Thank you . Okay , let me just change .
 gudje ? - Nautical term .
 - Cheating man . - Okay .
 - Hey .
 - Hey ...
 Hi . - She still didn 't call ? - No .
 Trouble ?
 Your sister stood me up the other night .
 Oh , no . Don 't you hate it when people aren 't there for you ?
 What is that ?
 Tushy !
 - Well , did you try calling her ? - I 've been trying for two days .
 When I called the restaurant , they said she was busy .
 I can 't believe she 's blowing me off !
 Excuse me , we had the two chef salads .
 No , we havn 't had hem yet . We 're still hoping to have them .
 Okay .
 - Hey .
 - Oh .
 You got a minute ? Yeah , I 'm just working .

 I got you a birthday present .
 Wow , you remembered !
 It 's a Judy Jetson thermos . Right , ike the kind you ...
 Right . Oh , I got something for you too .
 How 'd you know I was coming ? Yeah , twin thing .
 I can 't believe you did this .
 I can 't believe you ... ... did this !
 So what 's the deal with you and Joey ?
 Oh , right . He is so great . But that 's over .
 - Does he know ?
 - Who ?
 Joey . You know , he 's really nutsy about you .
 He is ? Why ? You got me .
 Excuse me ... ... doesn 't this come with a side salad ?
 So are you gonna call him ?
 - You think he likes me ? - No .
 Joey . No , no . He is so smart .
 He 'll figure it out .
 Do you want some chicken ?
 No , no . No food with a face , remember ?
 You have not changed . Yeah , you too .
 Excuse me . My side salad ?
 The service in here is horrible .
 Hi !
 Remember us ?
 You just called about needing a signature on the admissions form ?
 Well , it turns out we need a whole new one .
 Because , you see ... ... I put the wrong name again .
 - Because ...
 - You 're that stupid !
 I am . I 'm that stupid !
 And I 'm just gonna pay for this with a check .
 Well , you know your insurance will cover that .
 Yeah , I know . I 'm just not that bright either .
 Mon , I 'm sorry about last night what I said . I don 't think you 're anything like your mother .
 Oh , that 's alright . And I don 't think you 're selfish running out on Berry .
 Oh , and I 'm sorry that I said you were a cow in high school .
 That 's okay . I was a cow .

 Okay , worst case scenario : Say you never feel like a father .
 Say your son never feels connected to you as one .
 Say all of his relationships are affected by this .
 Do you have a point ? You know , you 'd think I would .
 What 's up with the simian ?
 It 's just a fur ball .
 Whose turn is it ? Yours . I got 43 points for " kidney " .
 No , you got zero points for " idney " .
 I had a " K " . Where 's my " K " ?
 You 've got to help me ! My monkey swallowed a " K " !
 You have to get that animal out of here ! You don 't understand , the animal hospital is way across town . He 's choking !
 I don 't know what else to do !
 - What 's going on ? - Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile .
 Excuse me . This hospital is for people !
 Lady , he is people ! He has a name , okay ?
 He watches " Jeopardy ! " ... he touches himself when nobody 's watching .
 Please have a heart .
 - I 'll take a look at him . - Thank you .
 - Michael ! - Rachel .
 - What ?
 - Monica .
 Urs ! What are you doing here ? I 've been trying to call you .
 Listen ...
 Oh , no no no , don 't say " listen " . I know that " listen " . I 've said that " listen " .
 I 'm sorry . I don 't get it . What happened ?
 What about what you said under the bridge ?
 Forget about what I said under the bridge .
 I was talking crazy that night .
 I was so drunk .
 You don 't drink . That 's right , I don 't .
 But I was drunk on you .
 But it 's not gonna work .
 Why ? Is it because I 'm friends with Phoebe ?
 If it was , would you stop hanging out with her ?
 No , I couldn 't do that .
 Then , yeah , it 's because of Phoebe .
 So you know , it 's either her or me .
 Then I 'm sorry .
 You 're gonna be really hard to get over .
 I know .
 I don 't know whether it 's just because we 're breaking up or what ... ... but you 've never looked so beautiful .
 Really ?
 Pheebs ?
 He looks so tiny .
 - We just got the message . - Is he okay ?
 The doctor got the " K " out .
 He also found an " M " and an " O " .
 We think he was trying to spell out " monkey " .
 The doctor says he 'll be fine . He 's just sleeping now .
