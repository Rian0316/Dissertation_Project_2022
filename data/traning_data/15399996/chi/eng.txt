 00 : 00 : 48, 360 -- > 00 : 00 : 51, 120 Mr Hulton 's waiting for you in the yard , Mr Herriot .
 Thank you .
 Mrs Hall ?

 Look at this , Mrs Hall .
 There 's a hole in my cricket flannels .
 So there is . I can 't wear them on Sunday with a hole .

 What would Mrs Pumphrey say ?
 It 's a good thing the Lord invented darning then .
 Right .
 Thank you .
 I 've just been speaking to Richard Alderson .
 Oh , aye ? Apparently , we 're still a man short for Sunday .

 It 's bad enough that we 've lost our top batsman .
 Tristan , I know you 're still unhappy with me , but this - this is cricket .
 The annual Darrowby match at Pumphrey Manor .

 You 're not just punishing me , you know , you 're letting down the whole team .


 Look , I told you - I can 't play for the Darrowby 11 any more .
 Oh , that 's just nonsense !
 It 's for local farmers and vets by invitation .
 And I , last time I checked , am neither .

 Herriot .

 Thanks so much for coming out .
 No trouble at all .
 I understand you 've a bull needs ringing ?
 I do indeed .
 This way .
 Here he is .
 This is Monty .
 Only a year old , but he 's a powerful fellow .

 No , I can see that !
 We also need to move him later today , so if you could sedate him once you 've got the ring in .

 That shouldn 't be a problem .



 I will need a couple more men to hold him , though .



 So , Hugh definitely said it was about a bull ?
 That 's what he said .
 He 's got a new bull that needs ringing .
 And he specifically asked for James ?

 He did .

 It 's about Helen .
 It 's got to be .
 I reckon James ' sins finally found him out .

 Don 't be daft .

 James has done nothing wrong .

 Tell that to Hugh Hulton .

 I won 't be a moment .
 Just going to give him an injection of local anaesthetic .
 Don 't most vets just go ahead and punch the hole ?

 They do ...

 I find this way works better .


 All right , almost done ...

 Easy now .



 Huh , look at that .
 Didn 't bother him at all .
 It usually works .

 Now , we just need the ring ...

 So have I missed very much while I 've been away in France ?

 Er , no , not that I can think of .
 No great Darrowby dramas to report ?

 No , just things chugging along , you know .

 Have you seen much of Helen ?

 No , not a great deal .

 But , well , now and again , you know .
 She seems well , does she ?

 Yes ...
 Yes , far as I can tell .
 Right , shall we get on with this , then ?
 I 'm going up there later , actually , to Heston Grange .
 Oh , yes ?


 Whoa !
 Easy , Monty . I say , James , are you all right ?

 Come on , Monty now .
 Calm down .
 I think I 'll live .
 Glad to hear it .




 So what 's the verdict ?
 Any hope ? Oh , there 's always hope .


 The adjustment nut 's a bit stiff , but once I 've worked it loose ,
 I can raise the bob and she 'll run right to time .
 That 's all it needs ?
 Well , you have to know how far to raise it .

 Oh , of course .
 I don 't doubt it takes a lot of expertise .
 Oh , don 't know about that .
 The main thing to remember is lower is slower and left is lower .
 Turn it to the right , it 'll go faster .
 That 's it .
 Ah , so you 've a cricketer in the house .
 Hm ?
 Oh , we 've two .
 But it 's Mr Farnon Senior who 's playing in the match on Sunday .
 To be honest , I 've never understood the appeal .
 I know , and I call myself a Yorkshireman !
 You 'll be at the match , I take it ?
 I will .
 In fact , I 'll be scoring .
 Ah , so you 're something of an expert ?
 An amateur enthusiast , perhaps .
 Anyway , I 'll ...

 I 'll let you get on .
 Oh , and thanks for the tea .
 Mm- hm .
 What time did Hugh say he 'd be up ?
 11 o 'clock .
 And he just said it where about the lease ? He did .


 So d 'you think he wants to sell ?
 Is that what he 's coming to tell us ?
 You know as much as I do .

 What if he 's decided not to renew the lease because of what happened between me and him ?
 Then I 'd say you were right not to marry him .

 Darrowby , 2- 2- 9- 7 .
 I 'm sorry , I can barely hear you .
 Ah , Mrs Pumphrey !
 Hello , is everything all right ?

 Mr Farnon ?

 No , I see .
 Well of course , if it 's a matter of " great delicacy " .

 I 'll tell him now .

 That was Mrs Pumphrey .
 She asked if you could go up to the manor .
 Doesn 't she want Tricki 's Uncle Herriot ? Apparently not .
 She said the matter requires the utmost discretion .
 Intriguing .
 Mm- hm !


 " The utmost discretion " ?

 What 's all that about ?
 I 've no idea - she said she 'll only discuss it with Siegfried ...
 In person .
 Hm !
 So , spill the beans .
 What happened at Hulton Hall ?
 Not a great deal .
 What , Hugh didn 't challenge you to a duel for Helen 's hand ?
 I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but , no .
 Well , has he seen her yet ?
 Er , no , he said he was going up later today .

 And that doesn 't bother you ?
 Of course not . Why should it ?
 No reason .

 Where are you off to ? Nowhere .
 I just , erm ...
 I need run an errand .
 Oh .

 He 's here !

 He 's here .
 Hullo there . How do .


 You got back all right , then ? I did . Yes .

 Thank you .

 Can I make you a cup of tea ? Er , no , no , thanks .
 I can 't stay long .
 You said you wanted to speak to us about the lease ?
 Yes , yes , that 's right . Er ...


 Ah , here we go .

 I intend to renew the lease on the farm for the agreed period of 20 years , as per our existing contract , but with a couple of additional stipulations .





 The lawyers have added Helen 's and Jenny 's names and specified that they 'll inherit the lease on the same terms .
 That 's assuming that they want to continue farming .
 That 's wonderful . Thank you .
 Thank you , Hugh .



 It 's very good of you .
 Not at all , it 's ... something that should have been done years ago , but erm ...
 Well , it didn 't really seem necessary before .

 Er ...
 Anyway , I think that just about covers it .
 I don 't want to take up too much of your time , but there 's something I 'd like to show you , back at the farm .

 I don 't understand .
 Consider it a replacement , or apology , if you like , for the difficulties with the sale of your last bull .
 Hugh ,, this is too much ...
 We can 't accept this .
 Please , Mr Alderson .
 It would mean a great deal .
 He 's good breeding stock , excellent condition ...
 Ah , well even so ...
 I would really like to make amends .


 Dad , why don 't we think about it , eh ? That 's all I ask .

 Just keep him here for now and let me know what you decide .
 Right . All right , then .

 Excellent .

 Right , better get on .

 Hugh . Do you have to rush straight off ?

 Afraid so .
 Estate business has rather piled up while I 've been away .
 No doubt see you at the cricket on Sunday .
 You will . Jolly good .




 Thank you so much for coming .
 Not at all , I understand Tricki has been rather distressed ? He 's not himself at all .

 Is he off his food ?
 Feeling lethargic ?
 Oh , no , no , there 's no problem in that department .
 In fact , if anything , his appetite 's more robust than ever .
 No , it 's just , erm ...
 He 's become ... .. increasingly ... .. amorous towards things .



 It 's quite unsettling .

 In the end , I had to take his cushion away .



 I see ...



 Well , let 's have a look at him , shall we ?

 You know , Mrs Pumphrey , the behaviour you 're describing , is perfectly normal .

 Tricki 's a healthy animal in the prime of life .

 And , as such , he 's experiencing some very natural ... urges .
 Yes , but he 's just a baby !
 He 's never shown the slightest bit of interest in ... .. that sort of thing .
 Well , it 's a testament to the excellent level of care he 's been receiving .
 His weight 's gone down , his exercise has gone up .
 He 's obviously feeling a great deal livelier in every department .
 You know , Francois did say that on one of their outings , he seemed intent on getting into Mr Handshaw 's yard .
 And does Mr Handshaw own a dog at all ?
 Oh , yes , a terrier .
 Named Bella , I believe .
 Well , that would certainly explain it .

 Less lethargic , more lothario .
 So what can be done to discourage it ?



 I 'm afraid the heart wants what it wants , which , in Tricki 's case , would seem to be Bella .
 Oh , dear . There is one effective course of action .

 It 's a fairly simple procedure ...

 Oh , no , no , no , no , Mr Farnon , no .

 Can 't you just give him a calming draught of some sort ?
 I 'm sorry , Mrs Pumphrey .
 He 'll have to be fixed .
 If not , Tricki will simply continue his pursuit until he succeeds .



 Hello , James .
 Hello , Jenny .
 Hello , Scruff .
 Wait till you see what Hugh Hulton 's brought us .


 Have you ever seen anything like it ? And he 'll be worth a fortune in stud fees .

 But Hugh won 't accept a penny for him , says it 's an apology because he wants to move forward with a clean slate .

 Jenny , run and put the kettle on .

 Dad 'll be wanting a brew and I 'm sure James 'd like one .

 Fine .


 A pedigree bull .
 Quite the gift .
 I know . It were the last thing we expected .
 We haven 't said we 'll take him yet .

 Dad thinks it 's far too much , but even so ...

 And there you were , worried he might not even renew the lease .
 I know , that 's all sorted now too .
 He 's even added mine and Jenny 's names , so it 'll be ours to inherit .

 Right .
 That 's very decent of him .
 Now , then ...

 Mr Alderson .
 What do you reckon ?
 He 's a fine specimen .
 He is that .
 Any luck with Reg Dutton , dad ?
 Nah , he 's still over in Listondale .
 Dad 's a player down for match on Sunday .

 Oh , yes ? And with Hugh back , they 'll be really up against it .


 Hugh 's on the opposing team ?
 He 's captain . Not to mention the star player .
 He 's the main reason they always win .
 Er , not always .
 Though Hugh is a good bowler , there 's no denying it .

 You know , Mr Alderson , if you need an extra man , I 'd be happy to help out .
 I didn 't know you played .
 Yes , well , now and again ...

 Oh , aye . You reckon you 're up to it , do you , lad ?


 Absolutely .

 Right .
 You 're in .



 I 'm really not much of a cricketer , but I guess if it 's just a friendly match , it 's not too much to worry about .

 Friendly ?
 James , I would not be exaggerating to say that this is the most important game in the cricketing calendar .

 Once a year , the Darrowby 11 goes up against the might of Hulton Hall 's invited gentlemen , playing for the honour of Darrowby .

 And get annihilated . That 's hardly the point .

 It 's really quite the event , James .
 Mrs Pumphrey holds it on her own private ground .

 Sorry , she has a cricket pitch ?
 Ground , yes , down beyond the orchard .
 The old dear 's completely cricket- mad .
 So , when you say you 're " not much of a cricketer " ... ?

 Well , football 's more my game .
 But you have played ?
 Once or twice , probably just once .
 Oh , dear .
 Well , I had no idea it was so important .

 Oh , I 'd say it 's important !
 For a Yorkshireman , it goes King , God , Cricket .
 I mean , if you get this wrong , they 'll string you up in the town square .

 Oh , fiddlesticks ! James is fast and he 's fit .
 All right , it 's not his game , but with a bit of coaching , he 'll do perfectly well .


 Quite right . We 'll soon whip you into shape , lad .


 So , we 've a day and a half .
 That 's what , 14 , 15 hours of sunlight ?
 Now , when you played before , would you say you were more of a batsman or a bowler ?

 Well , neither really .
 It was on the beach at Troon and it was probably more what you would call French cricket .

 But it can 't be any tougher than football .
 At least in cricket , no- one tackles you .
 You haven 't had a cricket ball coming at you at 80mph .
 Seriously , James , one of those could kill you .
 Right , follow me .



 Jess , come on , give that , the boys need it for the cricket . Thank you . Right , come on .
 Right , James .
 Take your guard .
 Remember , middle and leg , head over the ball , straight back .

 Weight on the front foot ...
 And nice easy lob ...
 You need to maintain your guard .
 How 's he getting on ? Try again ...

 You could give your brother a hand .
 Yes , and he could apologise for treating me like a fool .

 But I don 't see that happening any time soon either . And ...

 James , please , try to concentrate !

 I ... !
 Right , once more , take your guard , middle and leg ...
 Oh , for the love of God . James , pass it here .



 Right , don 't even think about hitting it , just think about blocking it . Blocking it ?
 You just need to get behind the ball and stop it , all right ?

 Come on .


 As long as it doesn 't hit your leg or the wicket , you 'll stay in . Well , there 's a little more to it , than that ...
 No , there isn 't , not for James .
 But , as ever , you 're making everything 10, 000 times more complicated than it has to be ...


 He needs to know what he should be doing ...
 No , he needs you to stop confusing him with pointless stuff .
 Just let the man breathe and he 'll work it out for himself .
 James . Here , give it a try .


 Right , that 's it , just relax , all you need to do is block it .

 It worked !
 Course it did .
 Now , just remember the cardinal rule - never step away from your stumps .
 Well , at least he 's making himself useful .
 Despite the injured air .
 He feels you still owe him an apology .
 Utter nonsense .


 So , you played a lot of cricket at school , then , did you , Triss ?

 Yes , fair bit . Captain of the first 11 , weren 't you ?

 Darrowby , 2- 2- 9- 7 .

 Yes , we had a pretty strong team at the prep school .
 Even won the inter- school cup three years in a row .

 I didn 't know that . No ?
 We actually set a new record for the Under 12s .


 The old man came to every match .
 Pa used to watch you play ?
 He 'd drive up in the mornings and we 'd make a day of it .
 You know how he loved cricket . Yes .

 Yes , I suppose he did .


 Mr Farnon , Mrs Pumphrey .

 She says she 's in dire need of your assistance .

 Mrs Pumphrey , what can I do for you ?

 The workmen were putting up the tea tent for tomorrow , you see , and Francois was clearly distracted .

 And , erm , poor Tricki , I mean , he dashed through the main gate and just ran and ran ...
 So Tricki is missing ?
 Foot to the bridge of the ball , James !
 Well , no , not , not exactly .

 He was , erm ...
 He was heading in the direction of Mr Handshaw 's yard .
 Ah . And I really can 't ask Francois ...

 No , of course .
 Er , leave ... leave it with me , Mrs Pumphrey , you 've nothing to worry about .


 Oh , thank you , thank you !
 Mr Farnon , when you see Tricki , could you pretend that you just happened to be passing ?



 He 's terribly private , I would hate for him to be embarrassed .
 I understand . Of course .




 Aye , he 's a determined little bugger .
 Well , as I say , Mrs Pumphrey did want me to pass on her sincere apologies .
 Not to worry . It 's not like he 's some stray .


 A litter or two of pups wouldn 't be the end of the world .

 Come on , then , young Trickiwoo , let 's put you back where you belong , shall we ?

 See you at the match tomorrow , Mr Handshaw .
 Your brother still not playing ?
 I 'm afraid not .
 That 's a damned shame .
 Might 've given us a fighting chance .



 Well , now he 's been there once , he 'll be much more inclined to visit again .

 Right , seems we have no choice .

 It 's a very simple procedure . In fact , I should be able to fit him in on Monday .

 That soon ?

 Well , all right .
 If we must , we must .
 But until then , you really need to keep him on a lead .

 Oh , Tricki .
 Will you ever forgive me ?
 All set for match tomorrow , I hope ?

 Absolutely . Raring to go ! Oh , that 's the spirit .
 And with James playing too , I really think this might be your year .




 I think we 're all here .
 Ladies and gentlemen , It 's my very great pleasure to welcome you all to Pumphrey Manor for this year 's encounter between The Darrowby 11 and the Hulton Hall Chaps .







 Has anyone seen Mr Rudd ?


 We 'll be playing a timed game , with the last 20 overs from five o 'clock . And , erm , I know we 're all looking forward to seeing some excellent cricket .

 So , erm , wi ...

 Without further ado , Mr Chapman ?
 Yeah ?
 If you would do the honours . Certainly .


 Well gentlemen , if you 're ready , will you two captains accompany me to the crease with the coin toss , please ?

 Thank you .

 Mr Alderson ... Mr Alderson .


 Young Rudds , where 's your father ?
 He can 't come , Mr Alderson , the sheep got out and he needs to round 'em up .
 You 're kidding me ? No , we 're not .

 We 're not .
 You 're not .
 So he 's not coming ?
 So we 're a player short .


 Well , go on .
 You can 't let them go out wi ' ten men .




 I can always play , Mr Alderson , if that would be any help ? Help ? Yeah , that 'd be a big help .
 Shame you didn 't offer before .
 Go and help your dad look for them sheep .


 Welcome to the team .
 Yes , thanks .




 Afternoon .


 Mr Hulton , would you like to make the call ?
 Heads .
 We 're bowling , lads .

 We 're batting .
 Well , we 've got to do it sometime .

 I 'd rather do it second , but ...

 Herriot .

 Hugh .




 Right , remember what we did last year ?


 Come on , boys , stay alert .
 Go on , dad .



 Look lively , Herriot .
 Come on , lads !


 OK , play .


 Knock to it , lads , come on !
 Unlucky , unlucky !



 Good shot ...
 Four !
 Excellent opener , Mr Hulton .



 Looks like Mr Hulton means business .
 Herriot .


 Oh , good shot !
 Yours , Herriot ! Get behind it .

 Come on , James !
 Unlucky .



 Just a single .
 Keepers ' end .



 That 's Hulton 's 50 .


 Herriot .
 James !
 Ball !
 Come on , lad !






 Eye on the ball , Mr Herriot .


 123 ... .. for no wickets .




 Not out .
 Chin up .
 Unlucky . Next time , lads .



 James is looking a bit hot .
 Hugh 's giving him a right runaround .
 Helen .
 How are you ? Hello , Margot .

 Yeah , I 'm fine thank you .
 This is my sister , Jenny .
 Hello .

 Are you enjoying the match ?
 I will once we start getting some wickets .
 Oh , yes , of course .




 Anyway , I 'm sure I 'll see you in the tea tent .
 What was all that about ?



 Let 's be having a wicket , Siegfried .
 Hello there . Hello .
 I noticed you were rather tied to your post and thought you might be in need of refreshment .
 Oh , that 's very kind of you .
 Thank you .
 Your Mr Farnon doesn 't seem to be having much luck .
 Trouble is , he 's overpitching .



 When you say " overpitching " ?
 He 's landing the ball too close to the batsman , making it easier to drive .

 Go on , James .

 He 's making it harder for the fielders .
 So he does .




 Are you all right , there , Herriot ?
 Fine , thanks .
 Well , you can 't blame the bull this time .



 Would you mind changing that to 138 ?



 Mr Chapman .
 Mm ?
 I think that 's enough .
 Come on , Harry .




 Ah , and that 's the declaration .
 Tea , everyone ! What 's happening ?

 Hulton thinks he 's got enough runs to win so he 's declared .
 He 's stopping .
 Well , that 's good news for us , isn 't it ? Aye . If you like charity .

 I could certainly use a cup of tea .
 Well , enjoy it while you can .
 We 're batting next .

 And it won 't be pretty .







 Pork pie , you love that .
 Oh , yum- yum- yum .
 No ?
 Or how about a tiny piece of iced bun ?

 Oh ! Oh , Mr Farnon . I hope you 're not too disheartened .
 Oh , not at all .


 We 've got a lot of strength in our batting .

 That 's the spirit .
 And , you have your secret weapon .

 Your brother , of course .
 Yes .
 He opened quite gloriously last year . He did do very well .

 Tricki , please .
 He simply hates this horrid lead .

 Well , it 's only till the operation . And what then ?

 Can you promise me he 'll still be my Tricki once he 's been emasculated ?





 Some dogs do present a slight change in temperament . Yes , that 's what I feared .

 It just feels too cruel .
 Why shouldn 't he be allowed to express his true self and experience life to the full ?


 And if Mr Handshaw were open to an arrangement ...
 Well , he certainly gave that impression . Well , what would you do , Mr Farnon ?



 Do you know what , Mrs Pumphrey ?

 If I were you , I would forget the lead and just let Tricki do what comes naturally .

 Life 's just too short , isn 't it ?
 I knew you would understand .




 Hugh , could I speak to you for a moment ?
 Course .
 I just want to say , how , how sorry I am . For everything that happened .

 That 's water under the bridge .

 No , I know , but I 've not had chance to apologise properly .
 In person .



 I never wanted to hurt you .
 We just weren 't right for one another . And I knew I wouldn 't make you happy .

 Well , I admit I ... I was rather devastated .

 But in a way , once the worst has happened , it 's actually rather freeing .
 And I think part of me always knew it wasn 't right .
 That we were good pals and I know you were fond of me , but ... well , it was never a grand passion , really , was it ?


 Well , no . Maybe not .
 Maybe one day we can be pals again .



 I 'd like that . About the bull .



 It was such a generous thing to do ...
 Did I overstep ? Because that , that really wasn 't my intention .

 And me Dad knows you meant well .
 We both do .
 But we can 't accept it .
 Right . Pay our own way .
 Always have .
 And you 've no reason to feel you have to make amends .



 Didn 't realise Herriot was a cricketer .

 Oh , he stepped in at the last minute .

 Ah , keen to impress the Captain , no doubt .



 We only started seeing each other quite recently .
 I mean , there were nothing going on before .
 Helen , really , I 'm just glad you 're happy .
 Well , I 'd better get back to the others .
 Discuss strategy and all that .




 Hello .
 Oh , there you are ...
 I saw you chatting with Hugh .
 Yeah .
 We had a really good talk .
 I feel like we cleared the air .
 Right .
 What 's wrong ?
 I just wondered why he was kissing you .
 Kissing me ?
 Oh , that were nothing . Right .

 He just wants to be friends .
 And he 's given you a pedigree bull to prove it .
 Yeah , well , I 've said I 'm not accepting the bull .
 You 're not ?
 Course not .
 It were a kind gesture , but we 're not in need of charity , however well meant .

 Now , then Herriot .

 I 'll put you up to bat last with you being a novice .

 Right . Very good .

 Yeah .
 Let 's hope that Hugh takes it easy with you .

 Right , ladies and gentlemen , I think we are ready to resume .


 Hulton 's looking deadly serious . But then I suppose he 's a lot riding on this . How d 'you mean ?

 Well , all those months he spent in France , too embarrassed to show his face .
 He 'll be wanting a win to restore his dignity .
 Triss !






 Lovely shot , Tristan .
 Cracking shot , Tristan !




 Go on , Triss .


 Brilliant !


 Again .






 Nicely done .
 Good running , lads .
 Stay .





 That 's unlucky .
 Now that 's called a batting collapse .
 It 's more exciting than I 'd anticipated .
 We 'll make a cricket convert of you yet .


 You know , I walk Rock down by Copley Brook most evenings .

 If you 're ever out with Jess and want a bit of company .
 Well ... perhaps we 'll see you down there .
 Last over . Doubt you 'll be needed .
 They need to get two wickets before you go in and Siegfried is looking strong .






 Catch it .
 Yes !
 Just four balls to face , Henry .
 Good luck , Henry .
 Come on , Henry . Thanks , lads . All the best , Henry .





 Play .


 I spoke too soon .

 Right , Herriot , get padded up .
 Henry 's retiring hurt .
 There 's three balls left till the end of the game . If they don 't get you out , we 'll draw .

 And that 's as good as a win .
 Just do what you can .





 All you have to do is stay in , old chap .
 Remember what we practised .
 Protect your wicket and guard your stumps .



 Middle leg . That 'll do .

 Go on , lad .
 Three balls to come .





 Fine .
 You all right , Jim ?
 Well done , James .




 Run .
 It 's gone for four .


 Back this end , old chap .



 Last ball of the match .
 Just block it again , exactly the same as before , and Hugh 'll be crying into his beer tonight .
 Come on , Mr Herriot . Come on , James .








 Unlucky , batsman .
 Hard luck , lad .
 Thanks , Bert .
 Funny that , almost looked like you deliberately stepped away from the wicket .

 Why ever would I do that ?

 I 've absolutely no idea .







 Hey .
 Bad luck , Mr Herriot .
 Nearly had a draw there .
 Aye , still , well played , lads .
 They were a tough side and no mistake .


 You carried your bat .
 Great achievement .
 Both of you .

 The old man would be proud .




 That 's , erm , very fine batting , young Farnon .
 James didn 't do too badly either .
 Till he lost his nerve . Dad !

 Oh , well , I 'm only saying it to him .
 Good try , Uncle Herriot .
 Thank you , Mrs Pumphrey .
 Well done , Triss .
 Thanks , Helen .


 Well done . I don 't think your dad 's too happy .

 Don 't worry about him .
 James , I just wanted to say ... .. well played .
 You too .
 I suppose the best team won .
 Still , that took real grit .
 Anyway , have a good evening .
 Both of you .




 So how does it feel ?
 What ?
 To have missed the most important ball of the match ?
 Is that what you did ?
 I felt I owed him a win .
 I know .
 And I love you for it .

 You do ?
 Yes , I suppose I do .







 Thank you , George .
 Ah .
 To your very good health .
 Cheers .

 You know , I don 't remember Pa ever visiting me at school .



 No ?
 He used to take me out on his rounds , though . I was nine when I delivered my first lamb . And you 've never looked back .


 No , I suppose I didn 't .



 I owe you an apology , Tristan .
 For not telling you the truth about your results .

 I genuinely believed I was acting in your best interests .
 Right .
 But I realise now , that I may have been ... wrong .
 Anyway , the money 's there , if you decide you want to go back to college .

 Equally , if you feel it 's not for you , well , it should be your decision .



 Thank you .



 Here he is !
 " An hour to play and the last man in . "
 I think he did very well .
 How 're the ribs ?
 Bit sore , to be honest . Oh , you poor old thing .

 No Tricki Woo , Mrs Pumphrey ?
 Tricki .
 Yes , Tricki has some personal business to attend to .







 Think it 's time I made my move .
 Well played , darling .
 Hugh and Margot ?
 Wait , are they ... ?
 I think you 've missed your chance , Triss . Bad luck , old chap .
 Well , she wasn 't really my type anyway .

 Since when ?

 No , it 's true , she was ... a bit too tall .
 Oh , for heaven 's sake .
 She 's a woman , not a pony .
 Oh , height is a consideration .
 You should be so lucky .
 Nothing wrong with tall .
 I 'm a catch .
 You 're a liability .
