 00 : 00 : 02, 084 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 885 So , we 're about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body .
 Okay .
 But I realize they 're gluing fur everywhere , except my cleavage .
 So , I asked the director why and he says , it 's important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape .
 It 's sweet that he thinks there 's a story .
 Oh , and there 's not even a bathroom on set .
 I have to go to the gas station across the street .
 I mean , I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there .
 Leonard , I could use your assistance .
 Sure . What 's up ?
 Well , now that I 've given up string theory , I 'm struggling to find my next area of focus .
 So , in your professional opinion , which of these areas do you think is the most promising ?
 Huh , well , I- I think there 's some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter .
 That 's helpful .
 Okay . Of these four areas ...
 PENNY : Sheldon !
 What did we say about being a nicer friend ? Thank you .
 Leonard , what did we say about being a gullible weenie ?
 It is just so frustrating .
 PENNY : 'Cause you 're trying too hard . You need to do something else .
 Get your mind off it . Hey . How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays ?
 Hey , that 's good . Why 'd you guys stop doing that ?
 You made fun of us . Said it was stupid .
 Yeah . Sounds like me .
 Come on , Sheldon . What do you say ?
 All right . I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday .
 Great ! What do , what do you want to do ?
 ( Sheldon and Penny sigh ) I don 't know .
 What do you want to do ?
 I don 't know . What do you want to do ?
 I 'm starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays .

 Hmm ... what could we do that 's fun ?
 What could we do that 's different ?
 What could we do that 's free ?
 ( gasps ) Got it !
 We order a pizza .
 Are you kidding ? That 's what you always do .
 Think harder .
 You 're right . You 're right .
 ( gasps ) Got it !
 We order calzones , cut them open , eat them like pizza .
 All right ! I 'll shake the brain bush one more time , see what falls out .
 All right !
 ( gasps ) Got it !
 There 's a live- action role- playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and reenacts battles from
 Uh , tell me more about this calzone idea .
 You know what ? Why don 't we just ease into this .
 Let- Let 's go for a walk and- and- and see if we find a new restaurant .
 Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park ?
 LEONARD : No .
 All right .
 Raj and Howard are at Howard 's mom 's , but should we call the girls and see if they want to come ? No .
 Bernadette 's working late .
 Amy 's sick .
 Aw . What 's wrong with her ?
 Well , she talks a lot . She always wants to hold hands .
 That 's not what I meant .
 Well , if you were referring to her illness your question should have been , " What ails her ? "
 " What ails her ? "
 Oh . Who knows ?
 Come on , anything can happen .
 We can push him down the stairs !
 Hey . Thanks for coming to hang out .
 No problem . How 's your mom feeling ?
 Okay , but she 'd feel better if she took her medicine .
 You know , when Cinnamon won 't take her medicine , I hide it in a piece of cheese .
 Good idea . We can wrap the pill in cheese , feed it to Cinnamon , and then my mom can eat Cinnamon .

 What do you feel like doing ?
 I was thinking we could watch a DVD .
 Well , ( sighs ) my mom doesn 't have a lot to choose from .
 Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy .
 Spoiler alert :
 20 minutes in , they find a prune pit .
 Actually , how do you feel about watching
 ( scoffs ) A straight- up gore- fest ?
 You hate this stuff .
 I do , but for some reason , Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow , so ...
 I thought if I start with you first , then I could act cool about it with her .
 That 's actually not a bad plan .
 I can sit through the colonoscopy now , but that first time I was like , " Oh , My God , a prune pit ! "
 Uh , so ... you 'd watch it ?
 Sure .
 ( sighs ) You 're a good friend . I owe you one .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Howard ! Help me get out of the tub !
 Not that one .
 So , we 're just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online ?
 Yep .
 Great .
 You know , this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won 't Stop Coming Up Friday .
 Hey , how about that Asian fusion place ?
 Fusion and Asians ?
 I 'm trying not to think about science .
 What the hell ?
 What ... ?
 She 's not working late !
 And Amy doesn 't look sick .
 Why would they lie to us ?
 That 's a good question .
 ( knocking )
 Amy and Bernadette .
 ( knocking ) Amy and Bernadette .
 ( knocking ) Amy and Bernadette .
 Why did you lie to us ? !
 Hey . Listen to this :
 " Murder ... cannibalism " and satanic rituals
 " are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await . "
 I just helped my mom out of the tub , so , I 'm one slippery horror ahead of you .
 You 're a good son .
 I don 't know how you do it .
 Beach blankets , my friend .
 It 's all about beach blankets .
 All right , let 's get this over with .
 Ew , it 's got someone 's hair on it !
 Oh , yeah , you 're gonna do great with this movie . ( blows )
 You 're not working late . Why did you lie to me ?
 And Amy , you told me you were sick , but you look just as pale and tired as always .
 I 'm sorry . I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory .
 And we kind of just wanted one night where we didn 't have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie .
 But none of that means we don 't love you .
 I haven 't been complaining that much about the movie .
 Have I ?
 I also love you .
 You know what ?
 Maybe I need a break from all of you .
 Come on , Sheldon .
 Where are we going ?
 We 're gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday , you 're gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I 'm gonna complain about my movie , and we 're gonna support each other because that 's what friends do .
 Okay .
 ' Cause if I had to pick now , I 'd probably go with dark matter because ...
 PENNY : Shut up .
 ( moans )
 What 's wrong ?
 I don 't understand my food .
 Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue ... in a taco .
 It 's fusion .
 Well , my mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity .
 Think I 've been complaining too much about the movie ?
 Not at all .
 Thank you .
 But to be fair , when you talk , most of what you say sounds like , " Wah , wah , wah , clothes " .
 Hey , I don 't understand why you 're not upset with Amy .
 I am . So much so that I 'm gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night .
 ( heavy metal soundtrack plays on movie )
 Okay .
 So , in the last 20 minutes , we 've seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar .
 We 've seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish .
 And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother .
 On the bright side , she didn 't even notice the pill .
 Why does Emily like this stuff ?
 Do you think there 's something psychologically wrong with her ?
 What difference does it make ? What do you mean ?
 Oh , come on -- she could have a freezer full of ex- boyfriend 's body parts and you 'd still go out with her .
 I do like that the ex- boyfriend 's out of the picture .
 I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon .
 How am I gonna make it up to him ?
 I 'd tell you what I do with Howard , but I don 't think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon .
 He 'd probably give you homework .
 Did you lie to Howard about tonight ?
 Of course .
 And you don 't feel guilty about it ?
 Between Penny 's gorilla movie and Howard 's gorilla mother , I had no choice .
 Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty .
 ( snorts )
 What ?
 I don 't lie to her .
 Oh , we know don 't lie to
 Thank you .
 Hey , maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these .
 Penny , there 's only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life 's problems , and that 's an Oreo .
 Or a Nutter Butter , if you 're in a pinch .
 Come on , open it . I bet it says something great .
 This is Asian fusion .
 For all you know , there 's a tiny Chihuahua in here .
 Fine , I 'll go .
 Hmm .
 " People turn to you for guidance and wisdom . "
 Yeah , that 's a good one .
 No , it 's not .
 How is that not good ?
 " Turn to you for wisdom " ?
 Clearly , that cookie is mocking you .
 You 'd never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter .
 Uh , since you 're paying for dinner , I 'll let that slide .
 Open yours .
 Have you ever paid for a meal ?
 Not with money . Read .
 " Your warm and fun- loving nature delights those around you . "
 Oh , try again . ( clears her throat )
 ( loud thudding on TV ) ( creaking on TV ) ( movie stops ) ( clears his throat )
 Let me get this straight .
 So , he kills this girl 's father , cuts off the guy 's face , and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her .
 I 'm just gonna say it .
 That 's not okay .
 Why can 't I be in a relationship with a girl who likes
 Raj , you the girl in the relationship who likes
 ( ringtone playing )
 Hey , Penny . What 's up ?
 No , Bernie 's working late .
 Really ?
 Thanks for telling me .
 What ?
 I 'm having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight .
 ( laughs )
 ( Penny gasps )
 Oh , I think I see our next stop .
 ( shrieks happily )
 You can 't be serious .
 If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense , I 'd follow Leonard on Instagram .

 No , come on -- tonight , we are trying new things .
 ( groans )
 Oh ! That 's a lot of incense .
 Or someone set a hippie on fire .
 Yeah , honey , I 'm still stuck at work .
 Really ?
 Penny said that ?
 Okay , it 's true . I 'm sorry .
 I 'll see you at home .
 Yeah , yeah , I 'll put it on .
 You and I never just hang out like this .
 Why is that ?
 I know , it 's weird , right ? Yeah .
 We should do it more often .
 Oh , no . I mean , this is weird right now .
 ( phone chimes )
 Oh .
 Ah , it 's Penny .
 Is she still mad ? Oh , doesn 't seem like it .
 She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her .
 A psychic ?
 He considers them not just mumbo jumbo , but extra- jumbo mumbo jumbo .
 Well , Penny can be pretty persuasive .
 She 's gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn 't normally do .
 Because she has sex with you .
 Yeah , she does .
 Can I confess something ?
 Once in a while , I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are .
 Really ?
 I mean , not in a romantic way .
 It 's just , she really has some sort of connection with him .
 Well , they 've known each other a long time , and Penny grew up around horses , so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish .
 Well ...
 Don 't get me wrong . I 'm glad they 're friends .
 I just wish he 'd be that comfortable around me already .
 Well , it took him a long time to get comfortable around me , too .
 Really ? What did you do ?
 Something terrible in a former life ? I don 't know .
 I gotta go .
 Penny ratted me out .
 FYl , she 's getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet .
 I don 't mean to be rude or discourteous , but before we begin , I 'd just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind .
 Which means -- and again , no insult intended -- but you 're a fraud ... ... your profession is a swindle , and , uh , your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people .
 Again , no offense .
 All right , Sheldon , just ask your question .
 ( clears his throat )
 Okay , I just did . What was it ?
 Oh , for God 's sake .
 Look , he 's a physicist who 's trying to figure out what his next field of study should be .
 For your information ,
 I was asking her about the next movie .
 Okay , I can answer that one : I 'll be bored .
 All right , why don 't we begin ?
 ( sighs ) ( exhales deeply )
 Your spirit guides are telling me that there 's a woman in your life you 're having problems with .
 That 's an easy guess .
 I 'm clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders .
 Yes , you clearly are .
 But I 'm seeing a specific woman that you 're in a romantic relationship with .
 Oh , oh , here we go .
 Does she have dark hair ?
 Yes ! Yes ! Your spirit guides are on fire !
 The majority of people have dark hair .
 Even you , at one time .
 Does she work in a similar field to you ?
 Ha ! The opposite .
 She 's a neurobiologist , and I 'm a theoretical physicist .
 My spirit guides can go suck an egg .
 They 're telling me that you have difficulty being close with her .
 Oh , he does . He does . What should he do ?
 ( exhales )
 He should give himself to this relationship .
 Once he does , all his other pursuits will come into focus .
 Sheldon , do you hear that ?
 I mean , Amy is the key to your happiness .
 Exactly .
 Personally and professionally .
 Everything will fall into place once you commit to her .
 You know what this is ?
 Yeah , and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it 's truly deserved .
 This is malarkey !
 Wow , you really struck a nerve .
 I 've never heard him use the " M " word before .
 Here we go :

 Now , just so you know , I was a nanny for three years , so if you get scared ,
 I can totally change your diaper .
 Actually , I have to tell you something .
 These kind of movies really aren 't my thing , so , last night , I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into .
 Okay .
 And I have to be honest -- I thought it was disturbing and weird , and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it .
 I wonder that , too .
 Then , why do you watch these things ?
 Can I tell you something without you judging me ?
 Sure .
 They kind of turn me on .
 And play .
 ( eerie sound effects , heavy metal soundtrack playing )
 MAN ( in distorted voice ) :
 Attention ...
 ( knocking )
 Hello .
 I didn 't expect you this evening .
 Well , I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night ,
 I wanted to make it up to you .
 And how do you propose to do that ?
 Unless you have on Blu- ray under that skirt ,
 I don 't know where you 're going with this .
