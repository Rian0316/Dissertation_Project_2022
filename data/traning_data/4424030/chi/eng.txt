 Would you like a to- go box , or are you just gonna put it in your beard with the rest of your sandwich ?
 We 're in a beard- growing contest .
 They happen all over the country .
 It 's a pretty big deal .
 What 's first prize ?
 Blindfold for your girlfriends ?
 I 'm kidding , I know you don 't have girlfriends .
 Actually , this level of hair- art takes months of hard work and commitment .
 Well , quack , quack ,
 My left armpit could beat you both .
 Let me tell you something on behalf of women everywhere .
 We . Don 't .
 Like .
 Beards .
 Caroline ? Beards ?



 ( Caroline ) I never liked being one .
 Ladies , if his name is Trace , get the hell out of there .
 See ?
 So , shave losers .
 If you 're chinless or chin- plentiful , it 's better than what you 've got going on .
 There 's your tip , be generous with mine .
 You actually insult people and then expect them to give you money ?
 That 's how it works with you and me .

 Thanks .
 Everyone 's loving our new cupcake T- shirts .
 I 've sold four in the last hour .
 Three more and we can afford that towel we 've had our eye on .
 These T- shirts keep selling .
 That means more money .
 Mo ' means mo ' success .
 Mo ' Success ?
 I think I dated his cousin , Les .
 Hey , everybody .
 Mind if I stop for a breather ?
 I 've been " briding " my ass off .
 Sophie , are those all your bridal magazines ?
 That 's only half .
 Come on , Oleg !
 Look , if those are too heavy , how are you going to be able to push the wedding donkey down the aisle ?
 Wedding donkey ?
 My excitement level for this wedding just skyrocketed .
 Relax , Sophie .
 If I know how to do anything , it 's how to move an ass .
 That 's true .
 Yeah .
 Wow , you 're carrying more heavy issues than Amanda Bynes .
 Look at all these .


 And do you really need
 Well , I haven 't ruled out cornrows .
 Cornrows and a donkey ?
 RSVP yes .
 Oh , yeah .
 This one 's hot .
 Save that one for later .
 Oh , I forgot I 'm getting married .
 Keep her .
 I might need a Tuesday off .
 Sophie , why don 't you get some help from your Maid of Honor ?
 I will kill you .
 Or a wedding planner ?
 Oh , Sophie , my cousin , Svetlana , is a wedding planner .
 Okay , but she better be good .
 Because I want everything to be perfect on my big day .
 Our big day .
 Yeah .
 Sure .
 I can 't believe this .
 They 're getting married and I don 't have a wedding donkey anywhere on my horizon .
 OMG , you sell these T- shirts ?
 I just bought one .
 Did I jut sell you that shirt and already forgot ?
 I knew that nine- cent deodorant was going to give me brain lesions .
 Well , the label did have a picture of a brain with " No Bueno " written on it .
 No , I bought it at a store in Manhattan on East Ninth and Broadway .
 I know because I 'm OCD and it was 67 steps and 14 sidewalk cracks from the corner .
 Max , someone else is selling our shirts .
 I know .
 We 're getting hosed by some other hoes .
 I can 't believe they stole our shirt .
 The one thing we made that people actually wanted to buy .
 I feel like Myspace .
 I haven 't seen anything this upsetting in a window since that time I accidentally caught a reflection of myself in my waitress uniform .
 We need to talk to someone about those damn shirts you jacked .
 We about to rumble .
 What she means is , we wish to speak to someone about the adorable cupcake T- shirts in the window .
 Or , we will be about to rumble .
 I 'm just working here till I get my PhD in the Eco- Social Dynamics of Western Civilization .
 So , forever ?
 Those T- shirts are our design and we need to know why they 're here and who knocked them off .
 It 's the granddaughter of the woman who owns this shop .
 She 's kind of a monster and she 's walking in right now .
 Hi , Kemberly and Ashlin .
 These ladies are interested in your T- shirts .
 Aren 't they cute ?
 So cute .
 Yeah , super cute .
 We designed them .
 Yeah , we designed them .
 What ?
 Yeah , what ?
 Ashlin and Kimberly , is it ?
 It 's Kemberly , with an " E "
 I changed it myself 'cause I 'm original .
 Yeah , she 's an original .
 You know what 's not original ?
 Those shirts .
 You stole them from us .
 We did not steal your idea .
 Yeah , we did not steal your idea .
 We copied it from this lame cupcake shop in Brooklyn .
 Wait a minute ... we have a lame cupcake shop in Brooklyn .
 Ashlin , you talk too much .
 This is why everyone knows about my lap- band .
 I think they know about it because you lost 200 pounds over Spring break .
 It 's hard to believe she was once twice this obnoxious .
 If you don 't stop selling our T- shirts , we 're gonna have to get our lawyer involved .
 Yeah , we 're gonna have to get our lawyer involved .
 And he 's gonna kill you .
 I don 't know what lawyers do .
 We 're totally not doing this for us .
 We 're rich .
 Yeah , we 're rich .
 A percentage of every shirt that we sell goes to charity .
 Yeah , it goes to charity .
 We are the charity that it needs to go to .
 You 're old and desperate for money .
 And I totally get it .
 My aunt 's one of the Real Housewives of New York .
 But , sorry .
 It 's the one without the leg .
 What just happened here ?
 That girl just called you old .
 Earl , I don 't think I 'm going to be buying you that pinky ring you wanted any time soon .
 No rush Max , you got plenty of time .
 I got like , six or seven months before I turn to dust .
 It 's 'cause our T- shirts got ripped off by a couple of prep school girls in Manhattan .
 It 's like a bad 80 's movie .
 I don 't know whether to date James Spader or teach this town how to dance .
 This is so unfair .
 Those girls can 't just steal from us .
 This isn 't 7- Eleven .
 Max , I can 't believe your naiveté .
 What does my body spray have to do with anything ?
 Look , there is no reason to be so upset about those two girls .
 They 're not going to affect our business .
 Plus , they have to live with themselves .
 And karma is a bitch .
 I mean , I littered once and look what happened to me .
 Hey , everybody .
 I 'm up to my nuts in bridal junk .
 [ bell dings ]
 There she is .
 The love of my life .
 The yin to my yang .
 The zing to my wang .
 Save that gold for the vows .
 I am Svetlana , Oleg 's cousin .
 Well , darling , it could be worse .
 You could be his sister .
 Svetty !
 And you must be Sophie .
 Yeah .
 No .
 But you haven 't even heard any ideas .
 Caroline .
 Sophie , why did you just say my name ?
 Oh , it 's Oleg 's and my safe word .
 Yeah .
 It means no .
 It 's the one word we both agreed we would never say during sex .
 Are you sure ?
 Because I give free oil change with every wedding .
 Caroline .
 All right , well , I 'll be in my booth .
 You know , this wedding planner thing is as crappy as the movie of the same name .
 Girls , I forgot to tell you , a man came by today with this letter for you .
 This reminds me of when I was a young , hot- shot courier .
 I was a young , hot- shot courier once , too .
 I used to deliver drugs to my mother at work on my tricycle .
 Oh , my God , Max , you 're not gonna believe this , but those two girls have issued a Cease and Desist order .
 Those bitches .
 What 's that ?
 They 're saying we have to stop selling our T- shirts .
 That 's what I told them we were going to do .
 They even copied this idea .
 We need to get a lawyer . How ?
 We can 't even afford on iTunes .
 Hey , do you think we could afford that lawyer on the subway billboards ?
 The one who has a gavel in one hand and a chicken in the other ?
 I think he just does
 What is going on here ?
 There 's food waiting in the window , periodicals strewn about .
 Someone 's on his periodical .
 Han , we just got served .
 At least someone in the diner has .
 You 're lucky your boss is so chill .
 Of course you 're chill , you 're one of Mr. Popper 's penguins .
 How about this ?
 We 'll do the jobs you already pay us for if you agree to pretend to be our lawyer .
 You have a suit , right ?
 Why would I pretend to be a lawyer ?
 You can 't even pretend to be waitresses .
 No one 's gonna believe Han 's our lawyer , anyway .
 He can 't pass the bar , he can barely see over one .
 That 's it !
 I 've had it with you two and your non- work ethic .
 And this area is for customers .
 I want these out of here !

 Uh- oh .
 Max ?
 I suppose I could dig up a suit if that could , somehow , make this boss striking his employee thing go away .
 Max , of course these girls go to Dalby Hall , all my archenemies did .
 I guess Lady Gaga won in the end , though .
 In other news , I kind of like this eye- patch .
 I know you do , you were pretending to be the pirate queen of the subway .
 Well , no one arrrrrgued with us .
 How long did the eye doctor say you have to keep it on ?
 And by eye doctor , I mean that first- year med student we gave the free dessert to .
 A few days , which is a bummer , ' cause only seeing half of how sad we are is kind of a blessing .
 How are we gonna find them ?
 Follow the scent of our decaying T- shirts business ?
 According to Instagram , they 're in the cafeteria , see ?
 Ashlin just posted a pic of a mini- pizza .
 # Thatpizzalife
 They have mini- pizzas here ?
 My high school didn 't even have heat .
 Sorry I 'm late .
 I had to pick up a suit at the Men 's Warehouse .
 Don 't you mean the Not Quite A Man 's Warehouse ?
 Han , I love your lawyer costume . So authentic .
 Only thing missing is the hole where your soul should be .
 Well , as I always say , if you 're going to do something ...
 Do it with your left hand so it will feel like someone else ?
 No , if you 're going to do something , do it right .
 Last Halloween , I went as Sprout from the Green Giant commercial and I even put pea pods over my pee- pee .
 You laugh , but I won $500 .
 Okay , I created my own Cease and Desist order .
 Where did you get this ?
 Same place Max printed out that fake ,
 " I don 't have herpe " doctor certificate .
 It works .
 And here 's your business card .
 Where ?
 Where is it ?
 I can 't see . Here .
 And Han , I hope you 're a better actor than Max .
 Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson is a better actor than Max .
 Mr. Lu Su ?
 That 's what you came up with ?
 Mr. Lu Su ?
 Well , you 're a lawyer , so the " Su " part is totally on point .
 But Lu Su ?
 No Asian was ever named that .
 Maybe not in this galaxy , but might I remind you of a Mr. Sulu .
 Oh , yeah .
 I mixed it up .
 Genius !
 Han , you don 't have to use the cards .
 I can make it work .
 Two Halloweens ago , I was an Ewok and turned an orange bath- towel into a turban .
 Second place . $250 .
 And next Halloween , you can wear that and goes as a lesbian minister .
 Okay , so the plan is , we go in there and calmly confront them with our attorney .
 I 'll do the talking .
 Han , you stand there and try to look smart . Ah .
 I 'm already Asian .
 So , done .
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 Wow , this brings me back .
 I had a seat at the popular table , the Debate Team table , the Student Council table , and the Waiting For Marriage table .
 But that table kind of fell apart when everybody got pregnant but me .
 I ate in the school parking lot with a wino .
 He was so nice to me , I thought he might be my dad .
 But then he never made a move on me , so I guess he wasn 't .
 ( Kemberly ) Attention everyone , attention .
 Yeah , attention everyone , attention .
 Ashlin and I are here today to sell our T- shirts and to talk about bullying and how it 's not cool .
 It 's so not cool .
 I was talking , Ash .
 Yeah , she was talking .
 Their charity is bullying ?
 That 's like Kanye West trying to raise money for laying low .
 A $3 donation will be made to our anti- bullying fund with each purchase of one of our super , super cute tees .
 Super , super cute tees .
 My super cute tee !
 Best idea I ever had .
 Right up there with the bong with a chin strap so you could be hands- free to change the channel .
 So buy a shirt right now and then we 'll be back later for the rest of the anti- bully talk .
 Yeah , buy them or my dad won 't pay for the lacrosse equipment this year .
 Let 's go .
 They are making a fortune on us .
 And if I 'm gonna get screwed , it better be by someone over 21
 Yeah , that sounds like a job with a two drink minimum .
 Han , don 't mess this up or you 'll be eating those glasses .
 Might I interest you in an anti- bullying pamphlet ?
 Might I interest you in a seat on my finger ?
 Hey , how did you two get in here ?
 The school pays guards out front to keep out the homeless .
 Yeah , well , jokes on you .
 ' Cause they just let us walk in .
 Hello , girls .
 You can " Cease and Desis " selling our T- shirts as of now .
 This is our attorney , Mr ...
 Lu Su .
 And he is holding our Cease and Desist to counter your Cease and Desist .
 Okay , well , first , your lawyer looks like a teacher on a Disney show .
 Is that a bad thing ?
 And if you have anything further to say , you can take it up with my lawyer .
 Her dad .
 And he 's real good .
 He got that CEO guy who admitted he killed his whole family out on a technicality .
 I forgot how mean girls can be .
 How ?
 I 'm your roommate .
 Thank you , Kemberly .
 Thank you , Ashlin .
 A little help .
 Hello , girls , you all look very nice .
 What is he doing ?
 Hopefully a tight ten and then he 'll bring up the headliner .
 This may be hard to believe , looking at me in this totally awesome suit , but I know a little something about being bullied .
 As a little child ...
 And as a slightly bigger adult .
 Seriously ?
 In the middle of his bullying speech , your bullying ?
 Kind of surprised even myself .
 I have someone who bullies me .
 Okay , let 's get out of here while I can .
 It 's not just the hitting and the name- calling .
 Although , not gonna lie , that 's a real bummer .
 You see , girls , the bad thing about being bullied is that every time it happens , it steals a little piece of who you are .
 And then , if it happens enough , little by little , you become just a little less of who you were meant to be .
 And that 's not cool .
 And these two girls up here , without knowing it , I 'm sure , stole a little piece of Max and Caroline .
 When they stole their little idea .
 And that 's so not cool .
 Yeah , that 's so not cool .
 Max , Caroline , we 'll stop making the shirts .
 Ash , I never said that .
 Ah , no , Kemberly . I did .
 And I liked you more before the lap- band .
 When you were still Kimberly with an " I. "
 [ gasping ]
 [ cheering ]
 Max , did Han just save us ?
 I wasn 't listening , I was putting mini- pizzas in my pocket .
 Girls , your shift started 40 minutes ago .
 What are you doing here so early ?
 Earl , good news .
 We are now the sole owners of all those cupcake T- shirts .
 And , literally , nothing else .
 Maybe I could rent a parrot and pick up some shifts at Long John Silver 's .
 Hey , girls .
 I 'm about to meet another wedding planner .
 And this one 's gonna be good !
 He 's gay .
 Sophie Kuchenski ?
 Yes , God !
 From the second I walked in here , I said to myself ,
 " That has to be her . " And I can see it .
 We 're going to make magic together .
 Yeah , what 's gay for no ?
 Okay .
 Wow , I think we just survived a " torgaydo "
 Where am I gonna find another gay wedding planner in New York now ?
 Just throw a tantrum in a Crate & Barrel , and five of them will come running .
 Hey , nice legal work today .
 You should be on the
 Yeah , from now on , I 'm calling you " Hanny Cochran " Okay .
 Next time you want to thank me , just send me an Edible Arrangement .
 I don 't know many times I have to drop that hint .
 But that 's just , like , a two- inch drop .
 Sorry .
 I can 't help myself .
 But , I 'm gonna to try .
 Because I know I was that bullie you were tallking about on that speech .
 What ?
 I was talking about the doorwoman in my building .
 I have to submit to a purple- nurple just to get my mail .
 There 's another woman ?
 Max , I think Han has a side bully .

 Well , I 'll just have to try harder .
 Because if anyone is gonna mercilessly nurple you into an early grave , it 's got to be me .
 I 'd like to think so , Max
 You 'd also like to ride in a car facing forwards .
 Back to normal .
