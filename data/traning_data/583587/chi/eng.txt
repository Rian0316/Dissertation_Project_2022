 - You cannot do this . - What ?
 Do what ?
 Roger wants to take her out . No ! Pheebs !
 Don 't you remember why you dumped the guy ?
 Because he was creepy . And mean . And a Iittle frightening .
 StiIl , it 's nice to have a date on Valentine 's Day !
 You can go out with a creep any night of the year .
 I know I do .
 What are you doing tomorrow night ?
 ActuaIly , tomorrow night depends on how tonight goes .
 - Listen , about tonight -- - Don 't you dare baiI on me !
 She 's only going out with me because I 'm bringing a friend for her friend .
 But her friend sounds Iike such a --
 Pathetic mess .
 I know , but . . . .
 Come on , man , she 's needy , she 's vulnerable .
 I 'm thinking . . . .
 Thanks .
 You haven 't been out with a woman since Janice .
 You 're doing this .
 She said yes .
 Way to go , man !
 StiII got the egg , huh ?
 How do I Iook ? I don 't care .
 There 's Lorraine .
 Now , remember , no trading .
 You get the pretty one . I get the mess .
 WeIl , weIl !
 Look what you brought ! Very nice .
 And what did you bring ?
 She 's checking her coat .
 I 'm gonna go wash the cab smeII off of my hands .
 WiII you get me a white zinfandeI and a glass of red for Janice ?
 Janice ?

 Oh . . . . . . my . . . . . . God !
 Hey , it 's Janice !
 I 'm making a break for it ! I 'm going out the window ! No , don 't , please !
 I 've been waiting for forever to go out with Lorraine !
 - Just calm down .
 - Calm down ? Calm down ?
 You set me up with a woman I 've dumped twice in the Iast five months !
 Can you stop yeIling ? You 're making me nervous . . .
 . . . and I can 't go when I 'm nervous .
 I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You 're right .
 Come on ! Do it , do it , do it ! Come on !
 Okay , Roger was creepy , but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney .
 - Which one was he ?
 - Pete the Weeper ?
 Remember the guy that used to cry every time we had sex ?
 " Oh , was it good for you ? "
 WeIl , I 'd take a Iittle crying any day over Howard , the " I win " guy !
 " I win ! I win ! "
 I went out with him for two months . I didn 't get to win once !
 How do we end up with these jerks ?
 We 're good people . I don 't know .
 I think we 're Iike some kind of magnets . I know I am .
 That 's why I can 't wear a digitaI watch .
 There 's more beer , right ? Oh !
 You know my friend Abby who shaves her head ?
 She says to break the bad- boyfriend cycle . . . . . . you can do a cleansing ritual .
 Pheebs , this woman is voluntarily bald .
 So we can do it tomorrow night , you guys .
 It 's Valentine 's Day . It 's perfect .
 Okay , weIl , what kind of ritual ?
 Okay , we can burn the stuff they gave us .
 Or . . . ?
 Or we can chant and dance around naked , you know , with sticks .
 Burning 's good .
 I 've got stuff to burn .
 You know . . . . . . ever since I was Iittle , I 've been able to pick up quarters with my toes .
 Yeah ? Good for you .
 Quarters or roIls of quarters ?
 By the way , Chandler , I cut you out of aII of my pictures .
 So if you want , I have a bag with just your heads .
 That 's okay .
 Are you sure ?
 Because you could make Iittle puppets out of them .
 And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty !
 We can 't do that !
 What ? What can 't you do ?
 Can I talk to you for a second ? Over there ?
 We might be Ieaving now .
 Say it 's you and me " we . "
 She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then Iick it off .
 I 'm not even sure what slathering is ! But I definitely want to be a part of it !
 Okay , you cannot do this to me .
 You 're right . I 'm sorry . You 're right .
 Can we have three chocolate mousses to go , please ?
 I 'm out of here . Here 's my credit card .
 Dinner 's on me . I 'm sorry .
 I hope she throws up on you .
 Thanks .
 So . . . .
 Just us .
 What a crappy night !
 Though I 've enjoyed the fact that your shirt 's been sticking out . . . . . . of your zipper since you came back from the bathroom .
 Excuse me .
 How you doing ?
 So do we have the best friends , or what ?
 Joey 's not a friend .
 He 's . . .
 . . . a stupid man who Ieft us his credit card .
 Another drink ?
 Some dessert ? A big- screen TV ?
 I wiII go for that drink .
 You got it . Good woman !
 A bottle of your most overpriced champagne .
 Each .

 And a rob roy . I 've always wanted to know .
 Happy Valentine 's Day !
 Oh , I miss you already .

 Hi , Ross . There 's someone I want you to say hi to . He just happened to caIl .

 HeIlo , Ross .
 Yes , that 's right ! It 's me ! How did you know ?
 I 'm just saying if dogs do experience jet Iag , then . . . . . . because of the whole seven- dog - years- to- one- human- year thing . . . . . . that when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles . . . . . . he doesn 't just Iose three hours , he Ioses , Iike , a week and a half !

 That 's funny !
 Who are they ?
 The blond is my ex- wife .
 And the woman touching her is her . . . . . . close personaI friend .
 You mean they 're Iovers ?
 If you want to put a IabeI on it .
 - Anything else I should know ?
 - Nope . That 's it .
 Oh , and she 's pregnant with my baby .
 I always forget that part .
 HeIlo !
 Okay .
 So now we need sage branches and the sacramentaI wine .
 AII I had is oregano and a Fresca .
 That 's okay !
 AII right . Now we need the semen of a righteous man . If we had that , we wouldn 't be doing the rituaI in the first place .


 Can we start throwing things in ?
 Yeah , okay !
 Okay . Barry 's Ietters .
 Adam Ritter 's boxer shorts .
 And I have the receipt from my dinner with --
 - A picture of Scotty Jared , naked !

 Okay , and here we have the Iast of Paolo 's grappa .
 Wait ! Isn 't it almost pure --

 Okay , Janice .
 Janice . Hey , Janice .
 There 's no way for me to teII you this .
 At Ieast , no new way for me to teII you this .
 I just don 't think things are gonna work out .
 That 's fine .
 It is ?
 Because I know that this isn 't the end .
 Oh , no . You see , actuaIly , it is .
 No , it isn 't . Because you won 't Iet that happen .
 Don 't you know it yet ?
 You love me , Chandler Bing ! Oh , no , I don 't .

 Then why do you think we keep ending up together ?

 How Iong has she been in the bathroom ?
 I don 't think she 's in the bathroom .
 Her coat is gone .
 WeIl , maybe it 's cold in there .
 Maybe I screwed up the first date I had in nine years .
 - That could be it .
 - Oh , God . You know , this is stiII pretty hot .
 Mushroom .
 Smile . They won 't aII be Iike this .
 Some might even stay through dinner .
 - I 'm sorry .
 That 's not funny . - No , it 's just . . . . WeIl , you know the whole getting- on- with- your- Iife thing ?
 WeIl , do I have to ?
 I mean , weIl , I 'm sitting here with this cute woman . . . . . . and she 's perfectly nice , you know ?
 But there 's . . . . That 's it .
 And then I 'm here talking to you , and it 's easy and it 's fun .
 And I don 't have to . . . .
 - I know . - You know ?
 Here 's a wacky thought .
 Let 's say you and I give it another shot .
 I know what you 're gonna say . You 're a Iesbian .
 But what do you say we just put that aside for now , you know ?
 Let 's just stick a pin in it , okay ?
 Because we 're great together , you know ? You can 't deny it .
 And besides , you 're carrying my baby .
 I mean , how perfect is that ?
 You keep saying that , but there 's something right here .
 I love you .
 I love you too .
 - But -- - No " but . " No " but . "
 You know that thing they put over here with the pin in it ?
 It 's time to take the pin out .
 You 'II find someone , I know you wiIl . The right woman is waiting for you .
 It 's easy for you to say . You found one already .
 AII you need is a woman who Iikes men and you 'II be set .
 Not her .
 We get off around midnight . Why don 't we pick you up then ?
 So wiII you bring the truck ?
 I 'II even Iet you ring the beIl .
 - We 'II see you Iater .
 - Bye !
 See you Iater !
