 But it 's dark out .
 That 's because you always sleep tiII noon , siIly .
 This is what nine Iooks Iike .
 I guess I 'II get washed up then .
 Watch that sunrise .
 I 'm getting tired of always sneaking around .
 Me too . What if we went away for the weekend ? No interruptions .
 We could be naked the entire time .
 AII weekend ? That 's a whole Iot of naked .
 I 'II say I have a conference and you can have a chef thing .
 I wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey !
 Okay . You know you 're not , though . - Let 's go .
 - Okay . Wait .
 What about Joey ?

 I 'm going to a culinary fair in Jersey this weekend .
 How weird ! Chandler just said he 's got a conference there . That 's funny .
 Seems Iike Chandler 's conference could 've been . . . . . . in Connecticut or Vermont .
 I 'm not in charge of where the conference is held .
 Do you want people to think it 's fake ? It 's a reaI conference .
 - Is RacheI here ? - No , she 's out shopping .
 - Damn ! - What 's going on ?
 I told Emily to come .
 And I just need to , you know , talk to RacheI about it .
 Wait a minute .
 When Emily comes , you won 't see RacheI anymore ?
 I 'm focusing on the " I get to see my wife " part . . . . . . and not on the part that makes me do this .
 So you 'II never be in a room together ?
 How wiII that even work ?
 I have no idea . I mean . . . .
 But I assure you , I wiII figure it out .
 It doesn 't seem Iike it 'II work .
 Hi , guys . What 's going on ?

 We 're flipping Monica 's mattress .
 So I 'm thinking , basicaIly , we pick it up , and then we flip it .
 That 's better than my way .
 Hey guys , would you flip mine too ?
 Oh , man .
 Oh , Iook ! A Ietter from my mom .
 So , Rach ?
 You know how Emily 's coming ?
 Oh , yeah . I know .
 Can you hear anything ?
 Yeah , somebody just said , " Can you hear anything ? "
 Hey , Joey 's ass .
 What are you doing ?
 Remember when they fought and broke up . . . . . . and we were stuck here aII night with no food ?
 When Ross said " Rachel " at the wedding , I figured it 'd happen again .
 So I hid this in here .
 Candy bars , crossword puzzles . . . .
 Mad Libs ! Mine !
 Condoms ?
 You don 't know how Iong we 'II be in here .
 We may have to re- populate the Earth .
 And condoms are the way to do that ?
 Anyway , it aII boils down to this .
 - The Iast time I talked to Emily -- - Oh , my God ! Our dog died ! - What ?
 - Oh , my God ! LaPooh , our dog !
 LaPooh 's stiII alive ?
 It says he was hit by an ice- cream truck and dragged for . . . . . . nineteen blocks !
 - Oh , my God . - Sweetie , we heard you crying .
 - Please don 't cry . - It 's LaPooh !
 I know , it 's LaPooh right now but it 'II get better .
 I can 't believe it ! We 're here !
 Chocolates on the piIlows ! I love that !
 You should Iive with Joey . Rolos everywhere .
 I 'II be right back .
 Oh , yes !
 Get in here . It 's a high- speed car chase on !
 We 're switching rooms .
 Oh , dear God ! They gave us glasses !
 The glasses have Iipstick on them .
 Who knows what else they didn 't change ?
 Sweetie . . . . . . I just want this weekend to be perfect .
 We can change rooms , can 't we ?
 Okay , but Iet 's do it now . Chopper Five just Iost its feed !
 You know how there was something I wanted to talk to you about ?
 Oh , yeah .
 I 'm trying to work things out with Emily .
 WeIl , there 's this . . . . . . one thing .
 Here goes .
 I made a promise that --
 - What ? - Your nose is bleeding .
 Oh , God !
 You 're bleeding .
 Not again .
 This happened when my grandfather died .
 Sorry .
 Gross .
 Okay . So I 'm sorry . What did you want to teII me ?
 Sorry . Sorry .
 I can 't see you anymore .
 I know , it 's ridiculous . I can 't see you , either .
 - I think you 'II Iike this room more . - Okay , great .
 They say he 's only got half a tank Ieft .
 Half a tank ? StiII Iots of high- speed chasing to do !
 - We 're switching rooms again . - What ? Why ?
 This has a garden view . We paid for an ocean view .
 Our Iast ocean- view room was unacceptable to you . Excuse me .
 Can I talk to you over here for just a second ?
 These clowns want to take us for a ride . I won 't Iet them .
 We 're not a couple of suckers .
 I hear you , Mugsy .
 AII these rooms are fine .
 Just pick one so I can watch the --
 Have a perfect , magicaI weekend together with you ?
 - This one I Iike . - Nothing .
 Nothing . It 's over . Damn it !
 This is regularly scheduled programming !
 Can we turn the TV off ?
 Do we reaIly want to spend the weekend Iike this ?
 Am I getting in the way of the room- switching fun ?
 Don 't blame me for tonight .
 Who should I blame ? The nice beIlman ?
 Or the idiot who thought he could drive . . . . . . from Albany to Canada on half a tank of gas ?
 Do not speak iII of the dead .
 We 're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together .
 What 's the matter ?
 I just want to watch a Iittle television .
 Jeez , relax , Mom .
 What did you say ?
 I said , " Jeez , relax , Mon . "
 I 've been wanting to teII you something and I just have to get it out .
 Okay . What 's up ?
 You know how you said to do whatever it takes to fix my marriage ?
 Yeah , I told you to give Emily whatever she wants .
 And while that was good advice , you should know that what she wants . . .
 . . . is for me not to see you anymore .
 That 's crazy ! You can 't do that . What are you going to teII her ?
 Oh , my God !
 You 've already agreed to this .
 It 's awful , I know .
 But I have to do this if I want my marriage to work .
 And I do . I have to make this marriage work . I have to .
 But the good thing is , we can stiII see each other untiI she gets here .
 Lucky me ! Oh , my God ! That is good news , Ross !
 That 's the best news I 've heard since LaPooh died !
 You have no idea what a nightmare this has been . This is so hard .
 Oh , yeah , reaIly ? Is it , Ross ?
 - Let me make this easier for you . - What are you doing ?
 - Storming out . - It 's your apartment .
 Yeah ? WeIl , that 's how mad I am !
 Damn Rolos ! You 're back !
 How was your conference ?
 It was terrible . I fought with my coIleagues for the entire time .
 Are you kidding with this ?
 So your weekend was a bust ?
 No , I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator .
 You 're back too .
 Could I talk to you for a second ?
 - How was your chef thing ? - It was awful .
 Some people don 't appreciate good food .
 Maybe the food tasted good at first . . . . . . but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea .
 How much was the room ? I 'II pay my half .
 Fine . $300 . $300 ?
 Just think of it as $25 per room .
 What are you guys woofing about ?
 Chandler stole a 20 from my purse !
 You know what ?
 Now that I think about it . . . . . . I constantly find myself without 20s , and you . . . . . . always have Iots .
 You should 've seen the Iook on her face .
 I don 't want RacheI to hate me . I don 't know what to do .
 - You want my advice ? - Yes . Please .
 - You won 't Iike it . - That 's okay .
 You got married too fast .
 - That 's not advice . - I told you .
 I 'm going to the bathroom .
 If anyone asked me to give up any of you , I couldn 't do it .
 Me neither .
 Maybe I could do it .
 I know you guys heard about me and Ross .
 But I 've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it .
 I don 't know if this faIls under that category . . . . . . but Ross is right back there .
 - That 's not Ross . - Not that guy .
 He does Iook Iike him , though .
 Ross is in the bathroom .
 Oh , my God ! It 's happening . It 's already started .
 I 'm Kip .
 Yeah , you 're not Kip .
 Do you even know who Kip is ?
 Who cares ? You 're Rachel .
 Who 's Kip ?
 My old roommate . We aII hung out together .
 Oh , that poor bastard .
 You told me the story . He and Monica dated .
 When they broke up , you aII promised you 'd stay his friend .
 And what happened ? He got phased out .
 - You won 't be phased out . - Of course , I am .
 It won 't happen to Ross . He 's your brother , your coIlege roommate .
 It was just a matter of time .
 I just assumed Phoebe would be the one to go .
 You Iive far away , you 're not related .
 You Iift right out .
 Hey , Mr. Bing .
 That hoteI you stayed at caIled .
 Someone Ieft an eyelash curler in your room .
 Yes , that was mine .
 I figured you met a girI and she Ieft it .
 That would have made more sense .
 I don 't even feeI Iike I know you anymore .
 AII right , I 'm just going to ask you this one time .
 Whatever you say , I 'II believe you .
 Were you or were you not . . . . . . on a gay cruise ?
 I 'm sorry about the whole " Iifting out " thing .
 You got to come with me .
 - Where ? - Wherever I go .
 You and me , we 'II start a new group . We 're the best ones .
 Okay , but try to get Joey too .
 Pheebs , do you mind if I speak to RacheI alone ?
 Sure .
 Bye , Ross .
 Forever .
 Why are you here ? Isn 't this against the rules ?
 I talked to Monica .
 Look , I 'm the one who made the choice .
 I 'm the one who 's making things change .
 So I should be the one to , you know , step back .
 No , no , it 's okay . ReaIly .
 Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving . . . . . . their coIlege roommates at reunions . . . . . . and Joey at Burger King .
 Is that better ?
 No , it 's not better .
 I stiII don 't get to see you .
 What would you do ? If you were me , what would you do ?
 First , I 'd have said the right name at my wedding .
 I can 't believe this .
 I know .
 I am so sorry .
 I know that too .
 Hey , Rach ?
 Sorry to interrupt , but Phoebe said you want to talk to me about a trip ?
 I just came over to drop off . . . . . . nothing .
 So that weekend kind of sucked .
 Yeah , it did .
 So I guess this is over ?
 You know , you and me . I mean , it had to end sometime .
 Why exactly ?
 Because of the weekend . We had a fight .
 Chandler , that 's crazy .
 If you always gave up after a fight . . . . . . you 'd never be with anyone Ionger than --
 This isn 't over ?
 You are so cute !
 No , no . It was a fight .
 You deaI with it and you move on . It 's nothing to freak out about .
 ReaIly ? Okay , great !
 Welcome to an adult relationship .
 We 're in a relationship ?
 I 'm afraid so .
 I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention .
 Saw him waiting for an elevator .
 Can I use your eyelash curler ? I Iost mine .
 It 's in the bathroom .
 Can I talk to you for a second ?
 Yes .
 Yes .
 You ?
 And you ?
 But you cannot teII anyone . No one knows .
 But how ? When ?
 - It happened in London . - In London !
 We didn 't want to make a big deaI out of it .
 But it is a big deal ! I have to teII someone ! You can 't .

 We just don 't want to deaI with teIling everyone .
 Please just promise you won 't teIl .
 AII right .
 Man , this is unbelievable !
 I mean , it 's great !
 But . . . .
 I know . It 's great !
 I don 't want to see that !
 We 're so stupid .
 Do you know what 's going on in there ? They 're trying to take Joey !
 " The most popular Phoebe in tennis is caIled the overhand Phoebe .
 If you win , slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say , 'Hi , Phoebe ! ' "
 That 's cute . We reaIly aII enjoyed it .
 - But it doesn 't count . - For what ?
 Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs .
 - I got to go . - Fun 's over .
 Wait , if we foIlow the rules . . . . . . it 's stiII fun and it means something .
 I 'm going to take off .
 Guys , rules are good !
 Rules help controI the fun .
