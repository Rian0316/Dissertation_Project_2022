 00 : 00 : 02, 084 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 879 I was unstoppable .
 I mean , I was ... I was on fire .
 It was like my mind and my body were totally connected ,
 like- like athletes must feel when they 're in the zone .
 Again , it was miniature golf .
 Admit it , you 're a little turned on .
 You can 't be this proud .
 Why not ?
 Because I beat you .
 Hey .
 Hi .
 Oh , good .
 You 're back .
 We have some exciting news .
 Okay .
 As you know , Amy and I have been together a long time , and a lot of things
 I never thought possible now seem possible .
 Okay ...
 After a careful evaluation of our relationship , we decided that the time was right to take a step forward .
 Okay .
 Do you want to say it ?
 Let 's say it together .
 BOTH :
 We 're getting a turtle !
 This is why I 've been saying we should keep champagne on ice .
 Sarcasm ?
 Yes .
 Okay .
 That was tricky , ' cause when it comes to alcohol , she generally means business .
 Well , we 're- we 're very happy for you .
 Yes .
 Thank you .
 Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us .
 No .
 It 's true .
 It means that we care so much about each other , there 's enough left over for an eight- ounce reptile .
 Why a turtle ?
 After much deliberation , we 've determined that a turtle is the ideal pet .
 They don 't shed fur , they don 't make noise ...
 For Halloween , we can dress him as a cobblestone .
 Yeah .
 And if he ever goes berserk , I know I can outrun him .
 Coincidentally , that 's also why I chose you as a roommate .
 Well , congratulations .
 Who would 've thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family ?
 Mm- hmm .

 Original Air Date on March 5 , 2015
 So , where 's your roommate tonight ?
 Well , I thought it was a little unfair that she 's always here , and you never get a chance to stay over , so ...
 I killed her .
 But remember our agreement ?
 You can joke about murdering people , but you have to say , " Just kidding . "
 And the more important thing to remember is that I 'd never hurt you .
 ( phone chimes )
 Oh , crap .
 I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient .
 That 's okay .
 I can come back later .
 No .
 No , don 't be silly .
 I won 't be gone long .
 Just stay here .
 Okay , cool .
 Oh , and you 're sure your roommate 's not gonna come back while I 'm here alone , right ?
 ' Cause that 'll be awkward .
 Oh , don 't worry .
 She 's in Palm Springs .
 Oh , good .
 Well , her torso is .
 Just kidding .
 I put her in a wood chipper .
 Oh , dear Lord .
 Oh , dear Lord .
 It 's okay .
 You made it .
 We 're fine .
 That was a lot of puppies .
 Let 's forget about them , and ... pick ourselves out a nice turtle .
 Yeah .
 Oh , how about this one up on the log ?
 Oh , I don 't know .
 He kind of looks like a jerk .
 How about this one ?
 Well , he 's barely moving .
 He looks half dead .
 I know .
 I like him , too .
 Hi , little guy .
 How 'd you like to come home with us ?
 You 'll be living with me because we don 't live in the same house .
 But that 's not your fault .
 Like you , we 're taking it ridiculously slow .
 You 'll stay with me when he 's at Comic- Con or away for work .
 Or if they accept Daddy 's application to live on Mars .
 What are you talking about ?
 Oh , there 's this company that 's attempting to establish a colony on Mars , and I applied to be among the first to go .
 What should we name him ?
 You know , I came in thinking " Seth , " but ... he kind of looks Italian .
 You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet , and couldn 't be bothered to tell me ?
 Would you have approved ?
 Of course not .
 Well , based on your reaction , it looks like I made the right choice .
 Isn 't that right , Giuseppe ?
 Hey , hey .
 Listen , I- I have a little confession to make .
 Aw , is this your first time ?
 No , I got you something for Valentine 's Day , and I was too embarrassed to give it to you .
 Well , why ?
 Well , 'cause I got it at the dirty store .
 You went to the dirty store without me ? !
 ( laughs )
 In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away .
 Well , get it !
 Get it for me !
 Yeah ?
 Yeah .
 Okay , uh , well , I hope it 's fun .
 I mean , it- it comes with paints , and- and it 's kind of creative and artistic .
 Okay , did you go to the dirty store or Michaels ?
 No , no .
 We cover ourselves in body paint , and then- then we get on this big canvas and do our thing .
 Whoa , that 's kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off .
 You 're making fun of me .
 Forget it .
 No !
 No , come on , I want to do it .
 Really ?
 Yeah , let 's you , me , and your very , very pale feet make some art .
 ( chuckles )
 Hey , when you got back to this store , I want to go with you .
 Okay , but it 's a drive -- the one I went to is in San Diego .
 How are the taxes going ?
 Okay .
 But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here .
 Those are business expenses .
 You can write those off .
 A $200 R2- D2 is a business expense ?
 Oh , Bernie , you 're gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited .
 ( cell phone rings )
 Hey , what 's up ?
 Eh , Emily ran back to the hospital , so I 'm just hanging out at her place .
 What are you , uh , what are you doing ?
 Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes .
 What are you , a little kid ?
 Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces , too ?
 She doesn 't have to -- I filled up on jelly beans .
 So , uh , what game are you ...
 Oh .
 Crap .
 What 's wrong ?
 I can 't get Emily 's nightstand to close .
 So ?
 She 's gonna know I was looking in it .
 Why were you looking in it ?
 Well , there 's a question
 I better have a good answer to before she gets back .
 Okay , calm down .
 There 's probably something jammed behind it .
 Just , uh , pull it out and see what 's there .
 Hang on .
 Oh ... no .
 Oh , no .
 Oh , God , no !
 You know what , you sound busy -- I 'm gonna let you go .
 Dude , the whole front came off .
 Now she 's gonna know I was snooping .
 What 's happening ?
 Raj was snooping through Emily 's drawers and broke one .
 Aw .
 I 'm gonna miss her .
 So what do you think ?
 ( sighs )
 I thought it 'd be a little more ... just more .
 I 'm not even sure why we were out of breath .
 Uh , I mean , d- did we move at all ?
 Maybe along the z- axis , but x and y are looking pretty sad .
 Okay , come on .
 We are not old boring people .
 We can do better than this .
 Uh , Th- that 's true .
 How late did we stay up last night ?
 Almost 1 : 00 a . m .
 Damn straight , almost 1 : 00 a . m .
 And we weren 't even watching TV .
 We were watching Netflix , like the kids do .

 Yeah , is it a comedy ?
 Is it a drama ?
 Nobody knows .
 Now , come on .
 We are gonna do this .
 Yeah .
 You get the paint , I 'll rest for 30- 40 minutes , and then we do this !
 I can 't believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home .
 No one told you to poke the turtle 's face .
 I was playing " Got Your Nose "
 That 's how you get children to like you .
 I 'm surprised you even care if he likes you , since you 're planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get .
 Ugh , this again .
 Amy , I 've already had one new hole torn in my body today .
 I don 't need another one .
 Sheldon , I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small , but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever .

 So you 're saying you wouldn 't leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet ?
 I would at least mention it before filling out the application .
 Huh , that 's exactly what Leonard , Wolowitz , Koothrappali ,
 Bernadette and Penny said .
 And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission , anyway ?
 You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite .
 First of all , this ... has only made me stronger .
 But beyond that , all I did was fill out an application .
 You know what ?
 Go to Mars , Sheldon .
 Is there anything I can do to cheer you up ?
 No .
 Forget it .
 What if I play the theme on my nose ?
 Please don 't . ( humming the theme )
 Yep , you 're mad .
 Okay , let me see the damage .
 KOOTHRAPPALl : Hang on .
 Well , I think you broke the dowels .
 You 're not gonna have time to glue it back on -- you 'll have to nail it .
 With what ?
 Does she have any pillows or wine glasses ?
 She does .
 Great .
 Neither of those .
 Try a hammer !
 Did that feel good ?
 You feel like a big man now ?
 I was going to make you red zinger , but since Mars is the red planet ,
 I went with peppermint .
 Why do you even want to do this ?
 Actually ... as part of the application ,
 I was required to make a short video answering that very question .
 You want to see it ?
 Can 't you just tell me ?
 But I made a video .
 I 'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper , and I 'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to ...
 ( echoing ) : go to Mars !
 I 'm exceedingly smart .
 I graduated college at 14 .
 While my brother was getting an STD
 I was getting a PhD .
 Penicillin can 't take this away .
 Being in close quarters , cleanliness is important and ... my hygiene is impeccable .
 In fact , animals don 't trust me because I smell like nothing .
 Yeah ... ( inhales )
 Literally nothing .
 During the seven- month space flight ,
 I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humor .
 Hey , Leonard ... is there any peanut brittle left in that can ?
 You mean this weirdly suspicious one ?
 Yes .
 Open it and check .
 I don 't get it .
 There 's actually peanut brittle in ...
 Please go to Mars .
 But on a more serious note :
 The most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe , as a scientist , it 's my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward .

 Now , I know that life on Mars will be difficult .
 But life here on Earth is no picnic .
 Also , picnics are no picnic .
 Where should we go for lunch ?
 Oh , I know , the ground .
 In conclusion , thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime .
 ( echoing ) :
 To Mars !
 Afterwards , Leonard blew his nose , and pie came out .
 LEONARD : Right there , right there ,
 Oh , God , that 's it !
 How did you get paint in your eye ?
 Because you wouldn 't let me wear safety goggles !
 ( sighs heavily ) This looks terrible .
 She- she 's gonna know .
 It 's fine .
 You just need two more nails .
 Okay , where should I put them ?
 In Emily 's eyes .
 You 're not helping .
 Well , maybe this is what you get for snooping .
 You know , it- it 's bad enough that I have to deal with this ...
 EMlLY : Raj ? I 'm back .
 ( door closes )
 Oh , no .
 Hey .
 Hi .
 ( stammering ) :
 How was the hospital ?
 Fine .
 What were you doing in there ?
 Uh ... w- well ...
 Okay , look , I- I don 't want to lie to you .
 I- I got curious , I was looking around ... and I broke the drawer on your night stand .

 You were looking in my night stand ?
 Yeah .
 So , the first time I leave you alone , you snoop on me ?
 You 've never snooped around my apartment ?
 No !
 Come on , think back .
 It would really help if you had !
 EMlLY :
 I can 't believe you don 't trust me !
 She sounds really mad .
 We should hang up .
 Yeah , we should .
 But we 're not going to , are we ?
 Not a chance .
 What happened to " snooping is wrong " ?
 Howard , you 're going to jail for tax fraud .
 Who cares ?
 Well , we did it .
 We sure did .
 I mean , I was on fire !
 I- I was in the zone , like an athlete .
 Sweetie , I beat you at this , too .
 So , where do we want to hang it ?
 What ?
 Are you kidding ?
 We 're not hanging it !
 But it 's an expression of our love .
 And our butts !
 Not hanging it !
 Seems a shame to throw it away .
 Yeah .
 ( gasps )
 We could give it to Sheldon , and tell him William Shatner painted it .

 God , I love you .
 I love you so much .
 I think I 'm gonna go home .
 Why ?
 I really don 't understand what 's happening here .
 You know , Sheldon , at any other time ,
 learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day .
 But a couple of hours ago , we were getting a turtle .
 And silly as it sounds ,
 I thought that meant something .
 Amy !
 Oh , why didn 't I give her Sleepy Time tea ?
 Amy , wait !
 Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me , too .
 Sure .
 Unless something better comes along .
 Do you want me to withdraw my application ?
 What I want is for us to be planning our future together .
 And in that future , are we on the same planet ?
 Yeah , because I 've seen people make the long- distance thing work .
 We 're on the same planet !
 Okay !
 Does that planet have to be Earth ?
 Are you asking me to go to Mars with you ?
 I am .
 Yeah , if I 'm going to a barren ,
 lifeless environment , where the chances of survival are slim to none ,
 I want you there with me .
 Why don 't we go back to the apartment , and fill out your application ?
 Okay .
 I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting .
 Oh , I know .
 We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars .
 We could be the first to watch on Mars .
 We could be the first to say " Good Lord , what on Mars are you talking about "
 You know , we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars .
 You just can 't keep it in your space pants , can you ?
 Think about it .
 If we had a family there , our kids would be Martians .
 They would , wouldn 't they ?
 We could give them cool Martian names .
 And we could teach them about Martian history .
 Like , who planted those flags ?
 And , uh , where did that copy of come from ?
 I guess we 'll have to make a new video together , as a couple .
 ( gasps ) Good idea .
 And since you 've had such a rough day ,
 I 'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard 's face .
 Thank you for forgiving me .
 It 's okay .
 At some point , we were bound to have our first fight .
 Well , it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust " doughy "
 The truth is you were right .
 And I was just angry at myself .
 Can I ask you one thing ?
 Of course .
 What ?
 Did you look in my closet ?
 No .
 Just the drawer .
 You promise you didn 't look in the closet ?
 I promise .
 Why , what 's in there ?
 Don 't worry about it .
 Good night .
