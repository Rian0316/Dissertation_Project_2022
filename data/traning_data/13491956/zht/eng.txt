 Wait , you 're Lori 's daughter , right ?

 Okay .
 Does your mom know you 're here ? Do you want to call her ?
 No , uh , she knows .
 - It 's okay . But I can ... I can just ...
 - Mm .
 No , no , no , no , no . Come on in . It 's okay .

 What 'd you guys get into and talk about at the lock- in ?
 Uh , nothing , really . Just , like , some games , I guess , and stuff . - Yeah .
 - Sounds like fun .
 You know , Alexa should be back soon .
 If you want to just wait up , her room is at the top of the stairs - on the left , okay ?
 - Okay .

 - Hey . - Hi . What are you doing here ?
 I ...
 I just ... I have to talk to you .
 [ Alexa ]
 Okay .
 [ exhales ]
 Sorry , could you just , um , close the door ?
 Thank you .
 [ door closes ]
 Okay .
 - Listen , I 'm really sorry . - No , no , no , no . - I 'm the one apologizing .
 You don 't have to apologize , okay ? - I got us in trouble for ... I am ...
 I 'm really messed up for what I did , and I should not have said what- what I said .
 And I- I 'm really sorry for that . And I ...
 I- I don 't want to give you , like , the wrong idea , because I- I know I 'm not gay .
 Like , I 'm 100 % positive that I 'm not .
 And- and I really don 't want to lead you on or whatever .
 But , like , you 're a Leo , right ?
 A- And I 'm a Libra . And there 's , like , zero compatibility there .
 Those are , like , the worst combination . So it just really wouldn 't work .
 And I took this quiz , and it , percentage- wise , turns out I 'm asexual . - So I- I ...
 - Katie , you ... No , no .
 I really just don 't want to give you the wrong idea .
 And that is ... what I wanted you to talk ...
 - I- I wanted to talk to you about . - Well , I don 't ... - So maybe I should just , like , go .
 - I don 't understand .
 Why did you kiss me ?
 Well , I- I wasn 't thinking in that moment , - and- and I wanted to , but I ...
 - Well , you wanted to ?
 Yeah , I wanted to , but I just wasn 't ... I- I wasn 't really thinking about ...
 Then that 's okay .
 If you wanted to .
 Well , did you want to ?
 Yeah .
 [ Katie ] Really ?
 Yes . [ chuckles ]
 Okay .
 Okay . [ chuckles ] [ chuckles softly ]
 Sorry that I 'm just , like , - standing here in your room , creepily . - [ chuckles ]
 It 's fine . I 'm pretty sure that my parents are probably making us breakfast right now . So ...
 We usually have pancakes every Saturday . [ chuckles ]
 Um , okay . Yeah , if ... - if you don 't mind .
 - No .
 [ chuckles ]
 - Will your parents mind ? - Nope . [ chuckles ]
 Okay , yeah . I just , like , probably have to , like , call my mom or text her really fast .
