 MORRlS : Mrs Owen 's expecting a lot of guests .
 And she chose you .
 Welcome to Soldier lsland . VERA :
 Mr Lombard , you seem to be underthe impression that I am a particular kind of woman .
 And I assure you that I am not .
 They 're the ten little soldiers .
 You know , from the poem .
 ACTOR : Ladies and gentlemen .
 - Who is that ?
 You are charged with the following indictments :
 Philip Lombard , that you did murder 21 men .
 What the hell are they playing at ?
 Malicious nonsense !
 Cyril ...
 I really tried to save him . I almost drowned .

 21 men .
 I 'm the only one telling the truth in a room full of liars .
 - ( Knocking ) - Who is it ?
 ( Choking ) MACARTHUR :
 We are cut off . Rats in a barrel .
 - Almonds .
 - Almonds be buggered .
 Cyanide .











 None of you moved them ?
 - No .
 - No .

 Was it you , Doctor ?
 No .

 How did Mrs Rogers die ?
 I have no idea .
 Did you give her something ?
 Yes , a mild sedative .
 - Did you give hertoo much ?
 - Miss Claythorne ... I warned you against becoming hysterical .
 It 's the poem .
 It 's the poem , don 't you see ?
 Ten little soldiers boys - one choked himself , one overslept himself , and then there were eight .
 There were ten ofthese and ten of us and nowthere 's eight .
 ( Door opens ) Oh , General ?

 General ? Did you move the figures ?
 What ?
 The figures , did you move the figures ?
 No , of course not . Perhaps it was you , Miss Claythorne .
 You discovered it .
 Of course it wasn 't me .
 Why would I do that ?
 To be the centre of attention .
 Do you crave it ?
 - Any kind of attention ?
 - What are you talking about ?
 Shall we just have breakfast ?
 - Mm .
 - Mm .
 ( Emily clears her throat ) It was dreadful news , about Mrs Rogers .
 ( Clears her throat ) She was a wonderful cook .
 Such a shame .
 This egg is four minutes precisely , is it ?
 Yes , madam .
 Rogers ... did you take away two ofthese figures ?
 - No , miss .
 - ( Sighs ) Condolences , Mr Rogers .
 When are you expecting Narracott ?
 Mid to late morning , sir .
 His timekeeping is somewhat erratic .

 Will that be all ?
 Yes , thank you , Rogers .
 Thank you very much .
 VERA : Tony Marston was young and strong .
 He didn 't die from some stimulant .
 Perhaps he was poisoned .
 And Mrs Rogers , perhaps she was given too much .
 What drugs do you have in your medical bag , Doctor ?
 Why did you even bring it ?
 You 're a guest . It 's not work .
 Actually , it is work .
 I was trying to maintain some sort of professional discretion .
 However ...
 Mrs Owen suffers from female neuroses .
 My speciality is women 's disorders .
 Mr Owen engaged me in a professional capacity to tend to his wife !
 Gave up on the surgery , then , Doctor ?
 People do not just die out of nowhere for no reason .
 They die because something was done to them by someone .
 - I 'm going to check your bag .
 - Don 't you dare !
 - What have you got to hide ?
 BLORE : How about I do it ?


 I 'm not being searched like some grubby criminal !
 EMlLY : What ifthe General goes with him ?

 He 's an honourable man .
 Fine ! But while you 're at it , you might want to search ...
 Judge Wargrave 's case as well .
 I knowwhere I 've seen you before . Chap who has the clinic beneath mine in Harley Street .
 He 's a cancer specialist .
 That 's where I saw you .
 If anyone has strong painkillers and sedatives in his case , it 's Judge Wargrave .

 Is that true , Judge ?
 I have had health problems , yes .
 Then that 's very cruel , Doctor .
 Don 't blame me .
 You pushed it .
 General , shall we ?
 ( Ticking )
 Just mild sedatives .
 ARMSTRONG : As I said .
 Bog standard .
 Nothing special .
 My surgery was a success .
 This - the house , the island - is meant to be my recuperation .
 Sea air , peace ... .. and rest .
 - Very sorry .
 I 'm very sorry .
 - Hm . - Well , there 's an end to it .
 - Like hell it is !
 Why shouldn 't she be searched ?
 Equal rights forwomen , hm ?
 Let 's see what you 've got .
 WARGRAVE :
 Dr Armstrong , control yourself , please .
 Who the hell do you think you are ?

 I 'm a doctor , you 're a secretary .
 Somebody moved them .
 They did !
 Someone did that .
 ( Door opens )

 Did you really kill all those men ?
 Yes , Miss Claythorne , I did kill all those men .
 And more .
 Why ?
 It seemed like a good idea at the time .
 They had something I wanted .
 In this case , it was diamonds .
 Worth more than a few lives .

 What about you ?

 What did you want ?
 I nearly drowned .
 I failed to save a little boy in my care .
 And there isn 't one minute of every day that I am not sorry for that .
 Why aren 't you ?
 I know what I am .
 I always knew it would catch up with me .
 And here it is .
 ( lnhales deeply )
 ( Shells exploding overhead )
 WOMAN : I love you , I love you , I love you .
 I think about you and you kissing me and your hands on me and in me and your mouth on my body and I cannot bear that you are not with me now .
 I wish ... I long ... I crave for you , my darling .
 And I feel so cruel to poor dear John .
 But the sun rises and sets in your eyes , Henry .

 I love you .
 I love you .
 I am yours .
 The men are all ready for the whistle , sir .
 Morale fairly good .
 ( Shells explode overhead )
 Here , er ... Iet me .
 Henry .
 You 've been a ... a great friend to my wife and l .
 ( Exhales )
 Perhaps you could call me John .
 ( Shells explode overhead )
 Thank you ... John .
 ( Gasps )
 ( Exhales heavily )
 Myself and Mrs Rogers were here for a week without seeing a soul apart from Narracott with the deliveries .
 Lombard .

 Where are you going ?
 We 're sat around waiting for Ulick Norman Owen .
 What if he 's been here all along ?
 Plenty of places he could be hiding .
 Wait for me .
 ( Breathes erratically )
 Please , please , please ... just fucking stop .
 Stop , stop , stop .
 Stop , stop .

 Now , this is ...
 This is barmy !
 No- one could hide down there .
 ( Gulls cry )

 Ever get the feeling you 're being hunted , Tubs ?
 Stop calling me that .
 I ain 't even fat . And , no , I don 't .

 Really ?
 Cos Mr Owen ... whoever he may be ... knows a lot about us .
 Well , not about me .
 Edward Landorwas a degenerate , he was a pansy .
 He fell down the steps into his cell .

 You never touched him ?
 I wouldn 't want to be near one ofthem dirty bastards .
 Come on , Tubs , keep up !
 ( Gulls cry )

 General ?
 Is your suitcase ready ?
 She died ... .. of Spanish influenza afterthe war .

 Who ?
 My wife Leslie .
 After all that ... she died ofthe Spanish flu .
 So many did .
 I should have just stepped aside like a gentleman and ... just let them be happy .
 Do come back to the house , General .
 You haven 't brought your case down yet and we want to get away as soon as Mr Narracott arrives .
 He 's not coming , Narracott , you know .
 No- one 's coming for us .
 We won 't be leaving the island .
 This is the end .
 It 's a reliefto come to the end , to knowthat it 's over .
 You won 't understand that yet but you will , in time .
 I think you 're quite mistaken .
 The boat will come and we 'll all be waiting for you .
 ( Exhales )
 ( Gulls crying )
 ( Shells booming )
 ( Voices whispering )
 ( Shellfire intensifies )
 ( Bombs exploding ) ( Gunfire and bullets whistling )
 Ah , Miss Claythorne .
 Good .
 Bring a couple of chairs , would you ?
 ( Chairs scraping )

 What 's going on ?
 It 's a bit early to be on the sauce .
 It 's been something of a morning .
 Hey , hey .
 Ssh .
 Bastard 's down there .
 I heard him .
 What bastard ?
 Owen .
 LOMBARD : I can hear him moving about .
 Marston 's room .
 ( Clattering )
 ( Rogers breathes heavily )

 What are you doing ?
 Camp bed .
 Well , we had to find somewhere to store it .

 Young men don 't look under beds .
 ARMSTRONG :
 Why do you need a camp bed ?
 What are you planning ?
 I can 't sleep in my room , can l ?
 My wife .
 No , obviously .
 Of course .
 I 've got to find somewhere else to set up .
 What for ?
 We 're all leaving ! Well , you might be .
 This is my job .
 I can 't go anywhere until my employer dismisses me .
 Your employer ?
 Your employer is insane !
 Be that as it may , I 've got nothing else to go to .
 All right , then , carry on , Rogers .

 Did you know he had a gun ?
 No .
 Do stop .
 Mr Narracott seems a sensible man .
 He 'll be here .
 I must say , I understand now why you teach in such a sub- standard establishment .
 I 'm just observing that most schools would not want to be associated with an inquest .
 I 'm not accusing you .
 There 's been enough ofthat already .
 Yes , there has .
 More than enough .
 Apart from the egregious Mr Lombard and the Rogers , who I find most dubious , and the depraved Mr Marston , it 's all nonsense .

 Everyone was simply doing their duty .
 As was l .
 As were you ?
 You didn 't say anything last night .
 It wasn 't for gentlemen 's ears .
 Beatrice Taylorwas my maid of all work .
 Foundling girl ... an unwanted .
 From the war , you know .
 I believed herto be a clean , decent , modest girl .
 I taught her needlework skills .
 We had quite the little home .
 But then she got herself into trouble .
 The family way .
 As her own loose mother had with her .
 She begged me for help .
 Naturally , and quite properly , I refused .
 ( Beatrice sobs )
 Miss Brent , please !

 I beg you !
 What happened to her ?
 She threw herself under a train .
 She killed herself ?
 Even made the local paper .
 And they turned it into some pot- boiling , sentimental tale .
 She asked you for help .
 If you had helped her ...
 It was the weakness in her character which drove her actions .
 Why should I be reproached ?
 Ask Rogers for some tea .
 Lemon , not milk .
 ARMSTRONG : It 's a wild goose chase , ifyou ask me .
 A grown man , hiding and sneaking about .
 It 's ridiculous . Marston was given cyanide , though .
 Wasn 't he , Tubs ?
 Cyanide ?
 I 'm pretty sure of it .
 I don 't know .
 You were convinced of it this morning .
 Claythorne forthe cyanide .
 I 'd put money on it .
 - She don 't seem the type .
 - She 's exactly the type .
 What about the old boy , the General ?
 Dangerous men come back from overthere , their noggins all scrambled .
 Let 's search everybody , then .
 God- bothering Miss Brent , let 's search Wargrave ...
 - The Judge ?
 - Mm .
 Well- known as a hanging judge .
 Infamous forthe black square . The story goes that he 'd watch every execution he 'd ordered .
 Tubs , you 've looked sideways at Armstrong all morning and now everyone 's fair game .
 - You suggested the Judge .
 - I was taking the piss .
 Mr Owen is on the island .
 And I 'm going to find him .
 You don 't want to pay attention to what he said .
 He 's just stirring the shit pot .
 And I can stir it right back .
 ( Wind rumbling )
 ( Gulls cry )
 ( Gulls continue to cry )
 ( Thunder rumbles )
 Oh .
 ( Men grunting )
 LOMBARD :
 Don 't look .
 Someone did this ?
 BLORE : Well , it weren 't no bleeding accident .
 It 's murder .
 He said no- one was coming for us .
 He said this was the end .
 Miss Claythorne ?
 " Eight little soldier boys travelling in Devon .
 One said he 'd stay there and then there were seven . "
 Count them , Judge .
 Count them .
 ( Thunder crashes )
 ( Wind howling )

 VERA :
 Cyril !

 Run !
 Find help , a boat !
 Run !

 Cyril !
 ( Cry echoes ) Cyril !
 Miss Claythorne !

 I just want to go !
 You 'll drown !
 Please !
 Please !
 Come inside . Come , come .
 I 've got you .
 Don 't worry , it 's all right .
 LOMBARD : I told you Owen was on the island .

 What made you so sure ?
 - lnstinct . - We 've got to be rational .
 Stick with procedure .
 Who is this Owen ?
 And Mrs Owen .
 I don 't think there even is a Mrs Owen .
 BLORE :
 We must all have something in common . - Someone who knows us all .

 EMlLY : How can that be possible ?
 I can imagine crossing paths with a doctor , a judge , but ... someone like Mr Lombard ?

 Well , we 've crossed paths now , haven 't we ?
 Mr Lombard , Blore tells me that you have a revolver .
 Oh , Tubs .
 - Why have you got a gun ?
 - He 's got a gun ?
 I carry it everywhere . And it was implied that I might need it .

 Implied ?
 By whom ?
 My client needs a good man who can handle situations .

 - Who 's your client ?
 - Mr Owen .
 Ulick Norman Owen .
 Never heard of him .
 But he has heard of you .
 Audrey , the box .
 It 's dangerous , then ?
 My client believes that it could become volatile .
 I see .
 And howwould Mr Owen wish me to proceed ?
 He leaves that to your discretion .
 - But forewarned is ...
 - Is forearmed .
 I understand .
 That 's who got in touch with me about the job with Mrs Owen .
 Isaac Morris in Soho .

 Soho ?
 Hm .
 WARGRAVE : I was invited here by the Owens , whom I 'd never heard of , to join a mutual friend ,

 Mrs Culmington .
 The perfect place to recover , it said .
 The envelope was postmarked London , Soho .
 A sink of depravity .
 A godless desert of vice .
 What brings you here , Miss Brent ?
 Mrs Owen wrote to me .
 She was interested in my work .
 The Moral Education of Girls ofthe lower orders .
 They have to be taught modesty and decency or society will be drowned in a rising tide of unwanted babies , all squalling to be fed .
 She wanted to contribute to my cause .

 Blore ?
 I got a letter ... from Ulick Norman Owen .
 He was impressed by my standing in the force .
 He said if I could see my way clear to spending some time keeping an eye out that he would recompense me generously .
 Keeping an eye out forwhat ?
 He said that someone was here underfalse pretences .
 He also supplied a list of guests .
 All ofyou - every one ofyou .
 What he didn 't say was that Lombard would have a gun .

 ARMSTRONG :
 Is it Mr Owen 's voice on the record ?
 - Does anybody recognise it ?
 - Are we forgetting the gun ?
 There 's a Fenian there with a bloody gun !
 - Don 't blaspheme .
 BLORE :
 Hand it over . Surrender yourweapon , Mr Lombard .
 - Not a chance .
 - I could make you .
 You can try .
 Wait . Is lsaac Morris Mr Owen ?
 No .
 I 'd have found that sweaty bucket of lard by now .
 EMlLY :
 Jews .
 Whereverthere 's a problem , there 's Jews at the bottom of it .
 - Something struck me .
 - ( Thunder rumbles ) I can 't think why I didn 't see it before .
 Ulick Norman Owen .
 Una Nancy Owen .
 Or ...
 U. N. OWEN ... .. is unknown . WARGRAVE :


 ( Thunder rumbles )
 It 's a riddle , perhaps .
 What does it mean ?
 It means that Mr Lombard is right to insist that the killer is on the island .
 And he 's getting very wet out there .
 The killer 's not out there .
 The killer is in here .
 It is one of us .
 We 've never met each other before now .
 Why ?
 How could I possibly be capable ?
 Oh , anyone is capable , Miss Brent .
 40 years on the criminal benches taught me that .
 Rogers .
 Oh , here we go again , lining up the next suspect .
 You mark my words - Rogers .
 He 's an oily bugger .
 Slinking around .
 EMlLY : Going back and forth during dinner .
 He could have put something in Mr Marston 's drink .
 I heard him tell Mrs Rogers to shut up .
 Well , she 's shut up now , isn 't she ?
 He 's the one moving the figures .
 But the General , the rest of us , that record , this house .
 Why ?
 Rogers - he 's got low cunning running through him
 Iike Brighton through a stick of rock .
 - We need to watch him .
 - Any faith I ever had in the Thin Blue Line evaporated the second I met you , Tubs .
 You call me that one more time , mate , one more time ...
 And you 'll what ?
 ( Wind howling outside )

 We are all being hunted .
 There 's someone else on this island .
 And when I find him , I 'm going to make him number 22 , with a bullet right there .
 - How could you say that ... so easily ? - Oh , God .


 I just open my mouth and it comes out .
 ( Door creaks open )
 I 'll see what can be done about supper .
 There 's some liver and kidneys .
 Perhaps a pie ... with some good gravy .
 That would be delicious , Rogers .
 Thank you . Thank you , Rogers .
 Well , I ain 't eating a mouthful of his pie .
 ( Sniffs )
 ( Thunder )
 ( Wind whistling )
 Oh , well , good night .
 ( Thunder cracks )
 Trust in God .
 But perhaps also ... we should lock our doors .
 ( Electricity fizzes )
 ( Muffled praying )
 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures .
 He leadeth me beside the still waters .
 ( Thunder cracks ) ( Door blows open and wind howls )
 ( Male voice recites poem )
 ( Crack of thunder )
 He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name 's sake .
 Yea , though I walk through ...
 BEATRlCE : .. the valley ofthe shadow of death ,
 I will fear no evil ... forthou art with me .
 .. I will fear no evil .
 I will fear no evil forthou art ...
 I will fear no evil forthou art with me .
 ( Thunder crashes )
 Get up !
 Get up !

 Get up !

 Get up !
 ( Gong resonating )
 - I was looking for him .
 - ( She vomits )
 I wanted a coffee .
 I looked ... and I found this .
 It wasn 't me .
 I just wanted a damn coffee .
 - It wasn 't me . - He 's been here all night .
 " Seven little soldiers chopping up sticks , one chopped himself in half and then there were six . "
 So she 's right .
 It is the poem .
 But he 's fucked , Mr Unknown Owen , because " Six little soldier boys played with a hive .
 A bumblebee stung one and then there were five . "
 And there is no hive here and there are no bees .
 What are you going to do now , Mr Unknown Owen ?
 You 're fucked !
 Now get dressed .
 We will all get dressed and I will make coffee .
 - Miss Brent , shall we ?
 - Yes .
 Shit .
 Shit the bed .
 We need to wrap him up or he 's going to go everywhere .
 ( Ticking )
 ( Approaching footsteps )
 Coffee .
 There 's no milk , I 'm afraid .
 Does this ... person ... .. mean to kill us all ?
 I believe so , yes .
 I 've lost a ball ofwool .
 I 'm quite ridiculously distressed about it .
 It 's only wool .
 ( Rumble ofthunder )
 ( Sighs )
 I 'm so very tired .
 Drink your coffee , Miss Brent .
 I 'll bring you a candle to see by .
 Thank you , dear .
 ( Crack ofthunder )
 ( Rain pattering on windows )
 I 'll make some more .
 Judge Wargrave , I feel I owe you an apology for exposing your illness in such an unforgiveable fashion .

 We 're all feeling a little ragged .
 Understandably .

 What 's your opinion ofthe others ?
 I haven 't really formed one . I don 't trust any ofthem .
 Blore .
 That bastard Lombard .
 Claythorne .
 Miss Brent and her religious mania .
 But you and I ... .. we have sharp minds .
 Actual intellects .
 We should stick together .
 Mm .
 Very well .

 Oh ...

 Here .
 Thank you . Dribbling down myself like a child .
 ( Thunder rumbling )

 Miss Claythorne 's making the coffee .
 She should be watched .
 ( Grunting )
 Right ...
 You do the stairs .
 I 'm going to wash the guts out ofthe wood store .
 ( Water splashes gently ) ( Crockery clinks )
 ( Door opens in adjoining room )

 Can l ?
 I rather enjoy domestictasks .
 They are soothing .
 Normal .
 Indeed .
 I 'll just be a moment .
 All right .
 ( Rain pattering on window )
 ( Hinges squeak )
 ( Gong resonating )
 VERA :
 Stung by a bee .
 - And then there were five .
 - ( Crack ofthunder )
 Well , I suppose , with no Rogers , I should think about lunch .
 I could eat a scabby horse .
 You 're actually hungry ?
 It was heavy work ... dealing with Rogers .
 And you 're the one who suggested lunch .
 Only because it 's what one does at this time of day .
 But I 'm not hungry . How could you be hungry ?
 Oi , you .
 Don 't go implying ... .. casting aspersions .

 I 've got nothing to do with this .
 I 've got nothing to do with any of it .
 Just because I said I was hungry ...
 I am .
 It doesn 't prove a single thing .
 I 'm going to get dressed .
 The whole morning , dragging Rogers around , clearing up guts , without so much as a cup oftea to wet my whistle ,
 - and you look at me like a ...
 - Calm down .
 You 've got some front , love .
 You got some right brass neck .
 LOMBARD : Don 't go downstairs on your own .
 Not with those two .

 - What , Wargrave and Armstrong ?
 - Mm- hm .
 You wait up here for me .
 LOMBARD :
 It was locked , which means there must be a master key .
 Rogers must have had a master key .
 - You two dealt with the body .
 - And you found it .

 Or did you ?
 You shrieking like a woman ... was that a bit of amateur dramatics ?
 I did nothing to Rogers .
 I didn 't take any master key .
 We don 't even know ifthere is one .
 And we only have yourword that the gun was stolen .
 - You could 've taken it .
 - Why steal my own gun ? I don 't knowwhy you 'd do anything , Lombard .
 I don 't knowwhy you killed Rogers
 - or Miss Brent or MacArthur .
 - I didn 't kill them .
 You would say that , wouldn 't you ?
 Just like you 'd say that your gun was stolen .
 You really are a first- class ... five- star , solid gold fucking moron .

 WARGRAVE :
 Please .
 The lady . Hm ? BLORE :
 Double bluff .

 What , Tubs ?
 Why you would steal your own gun .
 Armstrong 's got a point .
 It 's all riddles and games , smoke and mirrors .
 Double bluff .
 You were the last one down .
 The last one .
 Ages behind everyone else .
 What took you so long ?
 - I don 't care to say .
 LOMBARD : You killed Rogers .
 You took the master key . You went to bed .
 You made sure all of us were downstairs , got into my room and took my gun .
 You have my gun , you little prick .
 - For heaven 's sake .
 - I never killed Rogers and I ain 't got your key or your sodding gun .
 Then what took you so long ?
 If you weren 't stealing my gun , then why were you the last down ?
 I was in the bloody lavvy if you must know .
 Constipated !
 ( Laughter )
 Oh , yes .
 Laugh it up .
 It 's not funny .
 I was bound up something rotten .
 ( Laughter ) Sat there in a muck sweat .
 So it weren 't me .
 It could have been any of us .
 Any one of us could have had the key .
 Any one of us could have the gun .
 ( Clock ticking )
 It is the only way to be sure .
 BLORE : It 's not like you 've been singled out .
 We 're all getting the same .
 BLORE :
 No key .
 No gun .
 Well ... now you , Miss Claythorne .
 Of course .
 I 'm just being thorough .
 You like Uncle Hugo , don 't you ?
 VERA :
 I do . I 'm in love with him .
 I love him so much it hurts .
 Silly . Girls are silly .
 ( Chuckles )
 And I 'm going to marry him . I heard Mummy say he couldn 't afford to get married .
 Well , I 'll find a way , Cyril .
 - lfyou marry Uncle Hugo ...
 - When I marry Hugo . - .. will you be my aunt ?
 - I will .
 Aunt Vera .
 And what fun we 'll have . Christmas and birthdays and summer holidays .
 Picnics , parties , pony rides .

 How happy we 'll be when we have everything .
 ( Rain pattering on windows )

 ( Muffled shouting )
 ( Muffled scream )
 ( She gasps )
 ARMSTRONG :
 Why isn 't Lombard doing this ?
 Blore and I thought it a good idea to keep you two apart .
 Well , well , Miss Claythorne .
 Mr Lombard .
 Philip .
 Vera .
 ( Door opens nearby )
 Nothing .
 We 'll search the rest of the house .
 Every room .
 ( Cutlery rattling )
 ( Clattering )
 ( Thunder )
 ( Clock ticking )
 ( Clock chiming )

 BLORE :
 We 're in hell ... and we 're being punished forwhat we done .
 WARGRAVE :
 He refused the hood . He haunts me still .
 Look at them .
 There 's something going on between them .
 VERA : And someone has to come for us soon .
 They have to .
 BLORE :
 I reckon we 're being watched .
 - ( Yells ) - We are .
