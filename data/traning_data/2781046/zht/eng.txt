 00 : 00 : 01, 410 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 477 Mr Magnussen , please state your full name for the record . Miss me ? Charles Augustus Magnussen .
 Mr Magnussen , how would you describe your influence over the Prime Minister ?
 The British Prime Minister ?
 Any of the British Prime Ministers you have known .
 I never had the slightest influence over any of them .
 Why would I ?
 I notice you 've had seven meetings at Downing Street this year .
 Why ?
 Because I was invited .
 Can you recall the subjects under discussion ?
 Not without being more indiscreet than I believe is appropriate .
 Do you think it right that a newspaper proprietor , a private individual , and in fact a foreign national , should have such regular access to our Prime Minister ?
 I don 't think it 's wrong that a private individual should accept an invitation .

 However , you have my sincere apologies for being foreign .
 That 's not what I meant .

 That is not in any way ...
 Mr Magnussen , can you recall an occasion when your remarks could have influenced government policy ?


 Or the Prime Minister 's thinking in any way ?
 No .
 Are you sure ?




 I have an excellent memory .
 Your car is waiting outside ... See you tomorrow .
 May I join you ?
 I don 't think it 's appropriate .
 It isn 't . Mr Magnussen , outside the inquiry , we can have no contact , no communication at all .

 Please don 't do that .
 In 1982 , your husband corresponded with Helen Catherine Driscoll .
 That was before I knew him .
 The letters were lively , loving ... some would say explicit .
 And currently in my possession .
 Will you please move your hand ?
 " I long , my darling , to know the touch of your ... body . "
 I know what was in the letters .
 She was 15 .
 She looked older .
 Oh , she looked delicious . We have photographs too .
 The ones she sent him .
 Yum- yum .
 He was unaware of her age .
 He met her only once before the letters began .
 When he discovered the truth , he stopped immediately .
 Those are the facts .
 Facts are for history books . I work in news .
 Your hand is sweating .
 Always , I 'm afraid . I have a condition .
 It 's disgusting .
 I 'm used to it .
 The whole world is wet to my touch .
 I will call someone , I will have you removed .
 What is that ?
 Claire de la Lune ?
 A bit young for you , isn 't it ?
 You want to hit me now ? Could you , still ?
 Little old lady now .
 Perhaps you should settle for calling someone .
 Well , go on .
 No ? Because now there are consequences .
 I have the letters and therefore I have you .
 This is blackmail .
 Of course it isn 't blackmail . This is ... ownership .
 You do not own me .
 Claire de la Lune .
 It never tastes like it smells , does it ?
 Lady Smallwood 's bill is on me . See to it .
 Yes , Mr Magnussen .
 Oh , God !
 Oh !
 You all right , ma 'am ?
 Fine , yes .
 Magnussen !
 No- one stands up to him .
 No- one dares , no- one even tries .
 There isn 't a man or woman in England capable of stopping that disgusting creature ...
 Ma 'am ? Turn the car around .
 We 're going back into town .
 Turn around .
 Where are we going , ma 'am ?
 Baker Street .


 ' You 've seen a lot of injuries , then ? Violent deaths ? '
 ' Enough for a lifetime . ' ' Want to see some more ? '
 ' Oh , God , yes . '
 ' The game is on . '

 I know it 's early . Really , I 'm sorry .
 Is that Kate ?
 Yeah , it 's Kate .
 Invite her in ?
 Er , sorry , yes , do you want to come in , Kate ?
 Hey !
 It 's hard .
 There you go .
 It 's Isaac . Oh , your husband ?
 Son . Son , yeah . He 's gone missing again .
 Didn 't come home last night . The usual .
 He 's the drugs one , yeah ? Er , yeah , nicely put , John .
 But is it Sherlock Holmes you want ?
 Because I 've not seen him in ages .
 About a month . Who is Sherlock Holmes ?
 See , that does happen .
 There 's a place they all go to , him and his friends .
 They all do whatever they do .
 Shoot up , whatever you call it .
 Where is he ? It 's a house , it 's a dump .
 It 's practically falling down .
 No , the address ? Where , exactly ?
 Seriously ? Why not ?
 She 's not going to the police , someone 's got to get him .
 Why you ? I 'm being neighbourly .
 Since when ?
 Ha , since now . Since this exact minute .
 Why are you being so ... ? What ?
 I don 't know , what 's the matter with you ?
 There is NOTHlNG the matter with me .
 Imagine I said that without shouting . I 'm trying .
 No , you can 't come , you 're pregnant .
 You can 't go , I 'm pregnant !
 What is that ? !
 It 's a tyre lever . Why ?
 Cos there were loads of smackheads in there and one of them might need help with a tyre .
 If there 's any trouble , just go , I 'll be fine .
 John , John , John , John ...
 It is a tiny bit sexy .
 Yeah , I know .
 Hello ?
 What do you want ?
 Excuse me .
 Oh , no , you can 't come in here !
 I 'm looking for a friend . A very specific ... friend .
 I 'm not just browsing .
 You 've got to go . No- one 's allowed here .
 Isaac Whitney , you seen him ?
 I 'm asking you if you 've seen Isaac Whitney and now you 're showing me a knife .
 Is it a clue ?
 Are you doing a mime ? Go .
 Or I 'll cut you .
 Oh , not from there . Let me help .
 Now , concentrate . Isaac ... Whitney ?
 OK , you asked for it .
 Agh !
 Ohh ! Right . Are you concentrating yet ?
 You broke my arm !
 No , I sprained it .
 It feels squishy . Is it supposed to feel squishy ?
 Feel that ! Yeah , it 's a sprain .
 I 'm a doctor , I know how to sprain people .
 Now where is Isaac Whitney ?
 I don 't know ! Maybe upstairs .
 There you go . Wasn 't that easy ?
 No , it was really sore .
 Mental , you are !
 No , just used to a better class of criminal .
 Isaac ? Isaac Whitney ?
 Isaac ?
 Hello , mate . Sit up for me , sit up .
 Dr Watson ? Yep .
 Where am I ?
 Arse- end of the universe with the scum of the earth .
 Look at me . Have you come for me ?
 Do you think I know a lot of people here ?
 Hey , all right ? Oh , hello , John . Didn 't expect to see you here .
 Come for me too ?
 Hello , Isaac .
 Mrs Watson , can I , can I get in , please ?
 Yes , of course , get in . Where 's John ?
 They 're having a fight .
 Who is ? !
 For God sakes , John , I 'm on a case !
 A month . That 's all it took .
 One ! I 'm working .
 " Sherlock Holmes in a drug den . " How 's that going to look ? !
 I 'm undercover . No , you 're not !
 Well , I 'm not now !
 In , both of you , quickly !
 Please , can I come ? I think I 've got a broken arm .
 No , go away .
 No , let him . Why ? Yeah , just get in .
 It 's a sprain .
 Anyone else ? I mean , are we taking everybody home , are we ?
 All right , Shezza ?
 " Shezza " ? I WAS undercover !
 Seriously , Shezza , though ?
 We 're not going home , we 're going to Bart 's .
 I 'm calling Molly .
 Why ? Because Sherlock Holmes needs to pee in a jar .
 Well ? Is he clean ?
 Clean ?
 How dare you throw away the beautiful gifts you were born with !
 And how dare you betray the love of your friends !
 Say you 're sorry .
 Sorry your engagement 's over .
 Though I 'm fairly grateful for the lack of a ring .
 Stop it . Just stop it !
 If you were anywhere near this kind of thing again , you could have called , you could have talked to me .
 Please , do relax . This is all for a case .
 What kind of case would need you doing this ?
 I might as well ask you why you 've started cycling to work ?
 No , we 're not playing this game .
 Quite recently , I 'd say , you 're very determined about it .
 Not interested . I am .
 Ow ! Oh , sorry , you moved , but it is just a sprain .
 Yeah , somebody hit me . Huh ?
 Yeah , just some guy .
 Yeah , it was probably just an addict in need of a fix .
 Yes , I think in a way it was .
 Is it his shirt ?
 I 'm sorry ? Well , it 's the creases , isn 't it ?
 The two creases down the front .
 It 's been recently folded , but it 's not new .
 You must have dressed in a hurry this morning .
 So all your shirts must be kept like that .
 But why ?
 Maybe cos you cycle to work every morning , shower when you get there and then dress in the clothes you brought with you .
 You keep your shirts folded , ready to pack .
 Not bad .
 And I further deduce ... ... you 've only started recently because you 've got a bit of chafing .
 No , he 's always walked like that .
 Remind me , what 's your name again ?
 They call me the Wig .
 No , they don 't . Well , they ... they call me Wiggy . Nope .
 Bill . Bill Wiggins .
 Nice observational skills , Billy .
 Ah , finally !
 Finally what ?
 Good news ? Oh , excellent news , the best .
 There 's every chance that my drug habit might hit the newspapers .
 The game is on . Excuse me ... for a second .
 You 've heard of Charles Augustus Magnussen , of course ?
 Yeah . Owns some newspapers .
 Ones I don 't read .
 Hang on , weren 't there other people ?
 Mary 's taking the boys home , I 'm taking you , we did discuss it .
 People were talking , none of them were me , I must have filtered .
 I noticed . I have to filter out a lot of witless babble .
 I 've got Mrs Hudson on semi- permanent mute .



 What is my brother doing here ?
 So I 'll just pay , then , shall I ?
 He 's straightened the knocker .
 He always corrects it , it 's OCD , doesn 't even know he 's doing it .
 Why do you do that ?
 Do what ?
 Nothing .
 Well then , Sherlock , back on the sauce ?
 What are you doing here ?
 I phoned him . The siren call of old habits . How very like Uncle Rudy .
 Though in many ways , cross- dressing would have been a wiser path for you .
 You phoned him . Of course I bloody phoned him .
 Of course he bloody did .
 Now save me a little time - where should we be looking ?
 " We " ? Mr Holmes ?
 For God 's sake !
 Anderson ? ! Sorry , Sherlock , it 's for your own good .
 Oh , that 's him , isn 't it ? You said he 'd be taller .
 Some members of your little fan club . Do be polite .
 They 're entirely trustworthy and even willing to search through the toxic waste dump that you are pleased to call a flat .
 You 're a celebrity these days , Sherlock .
 You can 't afford a drug habit .
 - I do not have a drug habit . - Hey , what happened to my chair ?
 It was blocking my view to the kitchen .
 Well , it 's good to be missed !
 You were gone , I saw an opportunity .
 No , you saw the kitchen .
 What have you found so far ?
 Clearly , nothing . There 's nothing to find !
 Your bedroom door is shut . You haven 't been home all night .
 So , why would a man who has never knowingly closed a door without the direct orders of his mother bother to do so on this occasion ?
 OK , stop , just stop ! Point made .
 Jesus , Sherlock !
 I shall have to phone our parents , of course . In Oklahoma .
 It won 't be the first time that your substance abuse has wreaked havoc with their line dancing .
 This is not what you think . This is for a case .
 What case could possibly justify this ?
 Magnussen .
 Charles Augustus Magnussen .
 That name you think you may have just heard , you were mistaken .
 If you ever mention hearing that name in this room , in this context , I guarantee you , on behalf of the British Security Services , that materials will be found on your computer hard- drives , resulting in your immediate incarceration .

 Don 't reply , just look frightened and scuttle .
 I hope I won 't have to threaten you as well .
 Well , I think we 'd both find that embarrassing .
 Magnussen is not your business .
 Oh , you mean he 's yours ?
 You may consider him under my protection .
 I consider you under his thumb .
 If you go against Magnussen , then you will find yourself going against me .
 OK . I 'll let you know if I notice .
 Um , what was I going to say ? Oh , yeah .
 Bye- bye .
 Unwise , brother mine .
 Ohh !
 Ugh !
 Brother mine ... ... don 't appal me when I 'm high .
 Mycroft , don 't say another word , just go .
 He could snap you in two and right now ,
 I 'm slightly worried that he might .
 Don 't speak , just leave .
 Oh .
 Er , Magnussen ?
 What time is it ?
 About eight .
 I 'll be meeting him in three hours . I need a bath .
 It 's for a case , you say ? Yep .
 What sort of case ?
 Too big and dangerous for any sane individual to get involved in .
 You trying to put me off ?
 God , no .
 Trying to recruit you .
 And stay out of my bedroom .
 Oh , John , hi . How are you ?
 Janine ? Sorry , not dressed .
 Has everybody gone ? I heard shouting .
 Yes , they 're gone .
 God , look at the time . I 'll be late .
 It sounded like an argument . Was it Mike ? Mike ?
 Mike , yeah . His brother , Mike . They 're always fighting .
 Mycroft .
 Do people actually call him that ? Yeah .
 Huh !
 Oh , could you be a love and put some coffee on ?
 Sure , right , yeah .
 Thanks . Oh , how is Mary ? How 's married life ?
 She 's fine . We 're both fine . Yeah .
 Oh , it 's over there now . Where 's Sherl ?
 ( Sherl ! )
 Er , he 's just having a bath . I 'm sure he 'll be out in a minute .
 Oh , like he ever is ! Yeah .
 Morning . Room for a little one ?
 Morning .
 Ooh ! So , it 's just a guess , but you 've probably got some questions ?
 Yeah , one or two . Pretty much . Naturally .
 You have a girlfriend ? Yes , I have .
 Now , Magnussen . Magnussen is like a shark .
 It 's the only way I can describe him .
 Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London Aquarium , John ?
 Stood up close to the glass ?
 Those floating , flat faces , those dead eyes .
 That 's what he is .
 I 've dealt with murderers , psychopaths , terrorists , serial killers .
 None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen .
 Yes , you have ?
 Sorry , what ? You have a girlfriend ?
 What ? Yes , yes , I 'm going out with Janine .
 I thought that was fairly obvious . Yes . Well , yes .
 You ... You ...
 You are in a relationship ? Yes , I am .
 You and Janine ? Hmm . Yes , me and Janine .
 Care to elaborate ?
 Well , we 're in a good place .
 It 's , um ... very affirming . You got that from a book .
 Everyone got that from a book .
 OK , you two bad boys . Behave yourselves .
 You , Sherl , you 're going to have to tell me where you were last night .
 Working . Working ? Of course .
 I 'm the only one who really knows what you 're like , remember ?
 Well , don 't you go letting on .
 I might just , actually .
 I haven 't told Mary about this .
 I kind of wanted to surprise her .
 Yeah , I think you probably will .
 But we should have you two over for dinner , really soon .
 Yeah . My place though , not the scuzz- dump .
 Great , yeah .
 Dinner , yeah .
 I 'd better dash . It was brilliant to see you . You too .
 Have a lovely day . Call me later .
 I might do . I might call you .
 Unless I meet someone prettier .
 Solve me a crime , Sherlock Holmes .
 You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner , but he is so much more than that .
 He uses his power and wealth to gain information .
 The more he acquires , the greater his wealth and power .
 And I 'm not exaggerating when I say that he knows the critical pressure point on every person of note or influence in the whole of the Western World and probably beyond .
 He is the Napoleon of blackmail .
 And he has created an unassailable architecture of forbidden knowledge .
 Its name ... is Appledore .
 Dinner ? Sorry , what dinner ?
 Me and Mary coming for dinner with ... wine and ... sitting .
 Seriously ? I have just told you that the Western World is run from this house and you want to talk about dinner ?

 Fine . Talk about the house .
 It is the greatest repository of sensitive and dangerous information anywhere in the world , the Alexandrian Library of secrets and scandals and none of it is on a computer .
 He 's smart .
 Computers can be hacked .
 It 's all on hard copy , in vaults , underneath that house .
 And as long as it is , the personal freedom of anyone you 've ever met is a fantasy .
 That was the doorbell . Couldn 't you hear it ?
 It 's in the fridge . It kept ringing .
 Oh , that 's not a fault , Sherlock !
 Who is it ?
 Mr Holmes said you can go right up .


 Oh . Go ahead .
 Sir ?
 Can I have a moment ?
 He 's fine .
 Look , I ... Right . I should probably tell you ...
 OK , I ...
 There .
 Doesn 't mean I 'm not pleased to see you .
 I can vouch for this man . He is a doctor .
 If you know who I am , then you know who he is .
 Don 't you , Mr Magnussen ?
 I understood we were meeting at YOUR office .
 This is my office .


 Well , it is now .
 Mr Magnussen , I have been asked to intercede with you by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood on the matter of her husband 's letters .
 Some time ago you put pressure on her concerning those letters .
 She would like those letters back .
 Obviously , the letters no longer have any practical use to you , so with that in mind ...
 Something I said ?
 No , no . I was reading .



 There 's rather a lot .



 Redbeard ?
 Sorry . Sorry , you were probably talking .

 I ...
 I was trying to explain that I have been asked to act on behalf of ...
 Bathroom ? Along from the kitchen , sir .
 OK . I 've been asked to negotiate the return of those letters .
 I am aware you do not make copies of sensitive documents .
 Is it like the rest of the flat ?
 Sir ?
 The bathroom ? Yes , sir . Maybe not then .
 Am I acceptable to you as an intermediary ?
 Lady Elizabeth Smallwood ...
 I like her .
 Mr Magnussen , am I acceptable to you as an intermediary ?
 She 's English with a spine .
 Best thing about the English ... ... you 're so domesticated .
 All standing around , apologising ... ... keeping your little heads down .
 You can do what you like here .
 No- one 's ever going to stop you . A nation of herbivores .
 I have interests all over the world but ... everything starts in England .
 If it works here ... ... I try it in a real country .
 The United Kingdom ,
 Petri dish to the Western World .
 Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need those letters so ...
 I 'm keeping them .
 Goodbye .
 Anyway ... ... they 're funny .
 Jesus !
 Did you notice the one extraordinary thing he did ?
 There was a moment that kind of stuck in the mind , yeah .
 Exactly . When he showed us the letters .
 OK .
 So , he 's brought the letters to London , so no matter what he says , he 's ready to make a deal .
 Now , Magnussen only makes a deal once he 's established a person 's weaknesses , the pressure point , he calls it .
 So , clearly he believes I 'm a drug addict and no serious threat .
 And of course , because he 's in town tonight , the letters will be in his safe in his London office while he 's out to dinner with the Marketing Group of GB from seven till ten .
 How do you know his schedule ?
 Because I do .
 I 'll see you tonight . I 've got some shopping to do .
 What 's tonight ?
 I 'll text instructions . Yeah , I 'll text YOU if I 'm available .
 You are , I checked . Don 't bring a gun .
 Why would I bring a gun ? Or a knife or a tyre lever .
 Probably best not to do any arm- spraining , but we 'll see how the night goes .
 Are you just assuming I 'm coming along ?
 Time you got out of the house , John .
 You 've put on 7lbs since you married and the cycling isn 't doing it .
 It 's actually 4lbs . Mary and I think seven .
 See you later .
 And breaking news now .
 John Garvie MP has been arrested today on charges of corruption .
 This follows an investigation ...
 Magnussen 's office is on the top floor , just below his private flat .
 There are 14 layers of security between us and him , two of which aren 't even legal in this country .
 Want to know how we 're going to break in ?
 Is that what we 're doing ? Of course it 's what we 're doing .
 Magnussen 's private lift .
 Goes straight to his penthouse and office .
 Only he uses it and only his keycard calls the lift .
 If anyone else even tries , security is automatically informed .
 Standard keycard for the building .
 Nicked it yesterday . Only gets us as far as the canteen .
 If I was to use this card on that lift now , what happens ?
 Here we go then .
 Well , the alarms would go off and you 'd be dragged away by security .
 Exactly . Get taken to a small room somewhere and your head kicked in .
 Do we really need so much colour ? It passes the time .
 But if I do this ...
 If you press a keycard against your mobile phone for long enough , it corrupts the magnetic strip .
 The card stops working . It 's a common problem . Never put your keycard with your phone .
 What happens if I use the card now ?
 It still doesn 't work . But it doesn 't read as the wrong card now .
 It registers as corrupted .
 But if it 's corrupted , how do they know it 's not Magnussen ?
 Would they risk dragging him off ?
 Probably not . So , what do they do ?
 What do they have to do ?
 Check if it 's him or not . There 's a camera at eye height to the right of the door .




 A live picture of the card user is relayed directly to Magnussen 's personal staff in his office , the only people trusted to make a positive ID .






 At this hour , almost certainly his PA .
 So , how does that help us ?
 Human error .
 I 've been shopping .
 Here we go then .
 You realise you don 't exactly look like Magnussen ?
 Which in this case is a considerable advantage .
 Sherlock , you complete loon .
 What are you doing ? ! Hang on , was that ... ?
 Hi , Janine .
 Go on , let me in .
 I can 't . You know I can 't . Don 't be silly .
 Don 't make me do it out here .
 Not in front of everyone .
 Do what in front of everyone ?
 You see , as long as there 's people , there 's always a weak spot .
 That was Janine .
 Yes , of course it was .
 She 's Magnussen 's PA .
 That 's the whole point . Did you just get engaged to break into an office ?
 Stroke of luck meeting her at your wedding .
 Yeah .
 You can take some of the credit .
 Jesus ! Sherlock , she loves you .
 Yes . Like I said , human error .
 What are you going to do ?
 Well , not actually marry her , obviously .
 There 's only so far you can go .
 So , what will you tell her ?
 Well , I 'll tell her that our entire relationship was a ruse to break into her boss 's office .
 I imagine she 'll want to stop seeing me at that point , but you 're the expert on women .
 So , where did she go ?
 That 's a bit rude .
 I just proposed to her .
 Sherlock .
 Did she faint ?
 Do they really do that ? !
 It 's a blow to the head .
 She 's breathing .
 Janine ?
 Another in here .
 Security .
 Does he need help ?
 Ex- con .
 White supremacist by the tattoos , so who cares ?
 Stick with Janine .
 Janine , focus on my voice .
 Can you hear me ?

 Hey , they must still be here .
 So is Magnussen . His seat 's still warm .
 He should be at dinner , but he 's still in the building .
 Upstairs . We should call the police .
 During our own burglary ?
 You 're really not a natural at this , are you ?
 No , wait .
 Sssh .

 Perfume and not Janine 's .






 Claire de la Lune .
 Why do I know it ?
 Mary wears it .
 No , not Mary . Somebody else .
 Sherlock !
 What would your husband think ?
 Your lovely husband , upright and honourable , so English .
 What would he say to you now ?
 No , no !
 You 're doing this to protect him from the truth ?
 Well , is this the protection he would want ?
 Additionally , if you 're going to commit murder , you might consider changing your perfume , Lady Smallwood .
 Sorry . Who ?
 That 's ... not Lady Smallwood , Mr Holmes .






















































































 Is John with you ?
 He 's , um ... Is John here ?
 He 's downstairs .
 So , what do you do now ?
 Kill us both ? Mary , whatever he 's got on you , let me help .

 Oh , Sherlock , if you take one more step , I swear I will kill you .
 No , Mrs Watson ... you won 't .
 I 'm sorry , Sherlock .
 I truly am .
 Mary ?
 It 's not like it is in the movies .
 There 's not a great big spurt of blood and you go flying backwards .
 The impact isn 't spread over a wide area .
 It 's tightly focused so there 's little or no energy transfer .
 You stay still and the bullet pushes through .
 You 're almost certainly going to die , so we need to focus .
 I said , " Focus ! "
 It 's all well and clever having a mind palace , but you 've only three seconds of consciousness left to use it .
 So , come on .
 What 's going to kill you ? Blood loss .
 So , it 's all about one thing now - forwards or backwards ?
 Exactly .
 We need to decide which way you 're going to fall .
 One hole or two ?
 Sorry ? Is the bullet still inside you ?
 Or is there an exit wound ?
 It 'll depend on the gun .
 That one , I think .
 Or that one .
 Oh , for God 's sake , Sherlock . It doesn 't matter about the gun .
 Don 't be stupid .
 You always were so stupid .
 Such a disappointment .
 I 'm not stupid .
 You 're a very stupid little boy .
 Mummy and Daddy are very cross because it doesn 't matter about the gun .
 Why not ?
 You saw the whole room when you entered it .
 What was directly behind you when you were murdered ?
 I 've not been murdered YET .
 Balance of probability , little brother .
 If the bullet had passed through you , what would you have heard ?
 The mirror shattering .
 You didn 't . Therefore ... ?
 The bullet 's still inside me .
 So we need to take him down backwards .
 I agree . Sherlock , you need to fall on your back .
 Right now the bullet is the cork in a bottle .
 The bullet itself is blocking most of the blood flow .
 But any pressure or impact on the entrance wound could dislodge it .
 Plus , on your back , gravity 's working for us .
 Fall ... now .
 What the hell is that ? !
 What 's happening ? !
 You 're going into shock .
 It 's the next thing that 's going to kill you .
 What do I do ? Don 't go into shock , obviously .
 Must be something in this ridiculous memory palace of yours that can calm you down .
 Find it .
 The East Wind is coming , Sherlock .
 It 's coming to get you .

 Find it .
 Hello , Redbeard . Here , boy .
 Come on . Come to me .
 It 's OK . It 's all right .
 Come on . It 's me . It 's me .
 Come on .
 Good boy . Clever boy .
 Good boy . Hello , Redbeard . They 're putting me down too now .
 It 's no fun , is it ?
 Redbeard .
 That was shock . You 're going to feel the pain .
 There 's a hole ripped through you .
 Massive internal bleeding .
 You have to control the pain .
 Control . Control . Control .
 You ...
 You never felt pain , did you ?
 Why did you never feel pain ?
 You always feel it , Sherlock .
 But you don 't have to fear it !
 Pain ... ... heartbreak ... ... loss ... ... death ... ... it 's all good .


 It 's all good .
 Sherlock ! Sherlock . Can you hear me ?
 What happened ?
 He got shot .
 Jesus !
 Sherlock .
 Which service do you require ? ' ♪ It 's raining ♪ It 's pouring ♪ Sherlock is boring ♪ I 'm laughing ♪ I 'm crying ♪ Sherlock is dying . ♪ Oh , my !
 Who shot him ? ! ' Emergency .







 Sherlock !
 We 're losing you .
 Sherlock !
 Come on , Sherlock . Just die , why can 't you ?
 One little push and off you pop .
 You 're going to love being dead , Sherlock .
 No- one ever bothers you .
 Mrs Hudson will cry ... and Mummy and Daddy will cry ... and the woman will cry and John will cry buckets and buckets .
 It 's him that I worry about the most .
 That wife ! You 're letting him down , Sherlock .
 John Watson is definitely in danger .
 Oh , you 're not getting better , are you ?
 Was it something I said , huh ?
 Sherlock !
 Mary .
 Hey . He 's only bloody woken up .
 He 's pulled through . Really ? Yeah .
 Seriously ?
 You ... Mrs Watson , you 're in big trouble .
 Really ?
 Why ? His first word when he woke up ...
 " Mary . "
 You don 't tell him .
 Sherlock ?
 You don 't tell John .
 Bad girl .
 Bad , bad girl .
 Look at me ... ... and tell me you 're not going to tell him .


 I 'm buying a cottage .

 I 've made a lot of money out of you , mister .
 Nothing hits the spot like revenge with profits .
 You didn 't give those stories to Magnussen , did you ?
 God , no . One of his rivals .
 He was spitting .
 Hmm .
 Sherlock Holmes , you are a back- stabbing , heartless , manipulative bastard .
 And you , as it turns out , are a grasping , opportunistic , publicity- hungry , tabloid whore .
 So , we 're good then ?
 Yeah , of course . Where 's the cottage ?
 Sussex Downs . Nice .
 It 's gorgeous . There 's beehives , but I 'm getting rid of those .
 Oh , it hurts , does it ?
 Probably want to restart your morphine .
 I might have fiddled with the taps .
 How much more revenge are you going to need ?
 Just the occasional top- up . Dream come true for you , this place .

 They actually attach the drugs to you .
 Not good for working .
 You won 't be working for a while , Sherl .
 You lied to me .
 You lied and lied .
 I exploited the fact of our connection .
 When ?
 Just once would have been nice .
 Oh .
 I was waiting till we got married .
 That was never going to happen .
 Got to go .
 I 'm not supposed to keep you talking .
 And also , I have an interview with The One Show and I haven 't made it up yet .

 Just one thing ... you shouldn 't have lied to me .
 I know what kind of man you are , but we could have been friends .
 I 'll give your love to John and Mary .

 You don 't tell him .
 You don 't tell John .
 So ... ... Mary Watson ... ... who are you ?























































 Mary Watson .








 I don 't know how much sense you 'll get out of him .
 He 's drugged up , so he 's pretty much babbling .
 Oh , they won 't let you use that in here , you know ?
 No , I 'm not going to use the phone . I just want to take a video .
 Oh , Jesus !
 So , where would he go ?
 Oh , Christ knows !
 Try finding Sherlock in London .
 He 's got three known bolt- holes .
 Parliament Hill , Camden Lock and Dagmar Court .
 Five known bolt holes .
 There 's the blind greenhouse in Kew Gardens and the leaning tomb in Hampstead Cemetery .
 Just the spare bedroom .
 Well , my bedroom .
 We agreed he needs the space .
 Behind the clock face of Big Ben .
 I think he was probably joking .
 No , I don 't think so .
 Leinster Gardens . It 's his number one bolt hole . Top , top secret .
 He only knows about it cos he stalked him one night .
 Followed ! Followed , yeah .
 He knew who shot him .
 The bullet wound was here , so he was facing whoever it was .
 So , why not tell us ?
 Because he 's tracking them down himself .
 Or protecting them .
 Protecting the shooter , why ?
 Well , protecting someone then . But why would he care ?
 He 's Sherlock . Who would he bother protecting ?
 Call me if you hear anything . Don 't hold out on me , John .
 Call me , OK ? Yeah . Yeah , right .
 Good night then .
 Bye then .
 John , need a cuppa ?
 Mrs Hudson , why does Sherlock think that I 'll be moving back in here ?
 Oh , yes , he 's put your chair back again , hasn 't he ?
 That 's nice . It looks much better .
 John , what 's wrong ? Tell me . John ?
 That 's your phone , isn 't it ?
 It 's Sherlock , John . Sherlock .
 John , you have to answer it !

 Spare any change , love ?
 No . Oh , come on , love .
 Don 't be like all the rest .
 Rule one of looking for Sherlock Holmes , he finds you .
 You 're working for Sherlock now ?
 Keeps me off the streets , doesn 't it ? Well ... no .
 Where are you ? ' Can 't you see me ? '
 Well , what am I looking for ?
 ' The lie , the lie of Leinster Gardens , hidden in plain sight .
 ' Hardly anyone notices .
 People live here for years and never see it .
 ' But if you are what I think you are , it will take you less than a minute .
 ' The houses , Mary . Look at the houses . '
 How did you know I 'd come here ?
 ' I knew you 'd talk to the people no- one else would bother with . '
 Huh , I thought I was being clever . ' You 're always clever , Mary , I was relying on that .
 ' I planted the information for you to find . '
 Ohh ! ' 30 seconds . '
 But what am I looking at ?
 ' No door knobs , no letterbox .
 Painted windows . ' 23 and 24 Leinster Gardens .
 ' The empty houses .
 ' They were demolished years ago to make way for the London Underground ,
 ' a vent for the old steam trains .
 ' Only the very front section of the house remains . '
 ' It 's just a facade .
 ' Remind you of anyone , Mary ?
 ' A facade ?
 ' Sorry , I never could resist a touch of drama .
 ' Do come in .
 It 's a little cramped . '
 Do you own this place ? ' Hmm , I won it in a card game with the Clarence House Cannibal .
 ' Nearly cost me my kidneys , but fortunately I had a straight flush .
 ' Quite a gambler , that woman . '
 What do you want , Sherlock ?
 ' Mary Morstan was stillborn in October 1972 .
 ' Her gravestone is in Chiswick cemetery , where five years ago
 ' you acquired her name and date of birth , and thereafter her identity .
 ' That 's why you don 't have friends from before that date . '
 Need to work on your half of the church , Mary .
 Looking a bit thin . Oh , orphan 's lot . Friends , that 's all I have .
 ' It 's an old enough technique , known to the kinds of people
 ' who could recognise a skip code on sight ... '
 At first I thought it was just a Bible thing , spam , but it 's not .
 It 's a skip code . ' .. Have extraordinarily retentive memories . '
 How can you not remember which room ? You remember everything !
 I have to delete something !
 207 .
 You were very slow .
 ' How good a shot are you ? '
 How badly do you want to find out ?
 ' If I die here , my body would be found in a building
 ' with your face projected on the front of it .
 ' Even Scotland Yard could get somewhere with that .
 ' I want to know how good you are .
 ' Go on , show me .
 ' The doctor 's wife must be a little bit bored by now . '
 May I see ?
 Huh , it 's a dummy .
 Well , I suppose that was a fairly obvious trick .
 And yet , over a distance of six feet , you failed to make a kill shot .
 Enough to hospitalise me , not enough to kill me .
 That wasn 't a miss , that was surgery .
 I 'll take the case . What case ?
 Yours . Why didn 't you come to me in the first place ?
 Because John can 't ever know that I lied to him .
 It would break him and I would lose him forever .
 And Sherlock , I will never let that happen .
 Please , understand , there is nothing in this world I would not do to stop that happening .
 Sorry .
 Not that obvious a trick .
 Now talk and sort it out and do it quickly .
 " Hark !
 The Herald Angels Sing " Oh , dear God , it 's only two o 'clock .
 It 's been Christmas Day for at least a week now .
 How can it only be two o 'clock ? I 'm in agony .
 Mikey , is this your laptop ?
 Upon which depends the security of the free world , yes , and you 've got potatoes on it !
 You shouldn 't leave it lying around if it 's so important .
 Why are we doing this ? We never do this .
 We are here because Sherlock is home from hospital and we are all very happy .
 Am I happy too ? I haven 't checked .
 Behave , Mike !
 Mycroft is the name you gave me , if you could possibly struggle all the way to the end .
 Mrs Holmes .
 Oh , thank you , dear . I 'm not absolutely sure why you 're here .
 I invited him .
 I 'm his protege , Mrs Holmes .
 When he dies , I get all his stuff and his job .
 No . Oh , well , I help out a bit .
 Closer .
 If he does get murdered or something ...
 Probably stop talking now . OK .
 Lovely when you bring your friends round ( ! )
 Stop it , you . Somebody 's put a bullet in my boy .
 If I ever find out who , I shall turn absolutely monstrous .
 This was for Mary . I 'll be back in a minute .

 Ah . Mary . There you are .
 Cup of tea . If Father starts making little humming noises , just give him a little poke .
 That usually does it .
 Did you write this ?
 Oh , that silly old thing , you mustn 't read that .
 Mathematics must seem terribly fatuous now .
 No humming , you .
 Complete flake , my wife , but happens to be a genius .
 She was a mathematician ?
 Gave it all up for children .
 I could never bear to argue with her .
 I 'm something of a moron myself .
 But she 's ... unbelievably hot .
 Oh my God , you 're the sane one , aren 't you ?
 Aren 't you ?
 Oh .
 Sorry , I just , er ...
 Oh , you two need a moment ?
 If you don 't mind ?
 No , course not . I 'll go and see if I can help with ... something or another .

 Those two . They all right ?
 Well , you know , they 've had their ups and downs .
 Baker Street , now .
 John , Mary ...
 Oh , Sherlock , oh , good gracious , you look terrible !
 Get me some morphine from your kitchen , I 've run out .
 I don 't have any morphine . Then what exactly is the point of you ? !
 What is going on ?
 Bloody good question .
 The Watsons are about to have a domestic and fairly quickly I hope , because we 've got work to do .
 No , I have a better question - is everyone I have ever met a psychopath ?
 Yes .
 Good that we 've settled that . Now we ... SHUT UP !
 And stay shut up , because this is not funny .
 Not this time .
 I didn 't say it was funny .
 You .
 What have I ever done ? Hmm ?
 My whole life , to deserve you ?
 Everything .
 Sherlock , I 've told you , shut up .
 No , I mean it - seriously , everything .
 Everything you 've ever done , is what you did .
 Sherlock , one more word and you will not need morphine .
 You were a doctor who went to war .
 You 're a man who couldn 't stay in the suburbs for more than a month without storming a crack den , beating up a junkie .
 Your best friend is a sociopath , who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high .
 That 's me , by the way , hello .
 Even the landlady used to run a drug cartel .
 It was my husband 's cartel . I was just typing .
 And exotic dancing .
 Sherlock Holmes , if you 've been YouTubing ...
 John , you are addicted to a certain lifestyle .
 You are abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people , so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you fall in love with conforms to that pattern ?

 But she wasn 't supposed to be like that !
 Why is SHE like that ?
 Because you chose her .
 Why is everything always

 Oh , neighbours !
 John , listen . Be calm and answer me .
 What is she ?
 My lying wife ? No , what is she ?
 And the woman who is carrying my child , who has lied to me since the day I met her .
 No . Not in this flat , not in this room .
 Right here , right now , what is she ?
 OK .
 Your way .
 Always your way .
 Sit .
 Why ?
 Because that 's where they sit .
 The people who come in here with their stories .
 They 're the clients , that 's all you are now , Mary .
 You 're a client .
 This is where you sit and talk and this is where we sit and listen .
 Then we decide if we want you or not .
 So , are you OK ?
 Oh , are we doing conversation today ? It really is Christmas ( ! )
 Now ?
 Seriously , months of silence and we 're going to do this now ?
 A. G. R. A. , what 's that ?
 Er ... my initials .
 Everything about who I was is on there .
 If you love me , don 't read it in front of me .
 Why ?
 Because you won 't love me when you 've finished and I don 't want to see that happen .
 How much do you know already ?
 By your skill set , you are , or were , an intelligence agent .
 Your accent is currently English , but I suspect you are not .
 You 're on the run from something .
 You 've used your skills to disappear .
 Magnussen knows your secret , which is why you were going to kill him .
 And I assume you befriended Janine in order to get close to him .
 Oh , you can talk !
 Oh , look at you two , you should have got married .
 The stuff Magnussen has on me ,
 I would go to prison for the rest of my life .
 So you were going to kill him ?
 People like Magnussen should be killed , that 's why there are people like me .
 Perfect ! So that 's what you were , an assassin ?
 How could I not see that ?
 You did see that .
 And you married me .
 Because he 's right .
 It 's what you like .
 So , Mary , any documents that Magnussen has concerning yourself , you want extracted and returned .
 Why would you help me ?
 Because you saved my life .
 Sorry- sorry , what ?
 When I happened on you and Magnussen ... ... you had a problem .
 More specifically , you had a witness .
 What do you do now ?
 Kill both of us ?
 ' The solution , of course , was simple . Kill us both and leave . '
 However , sentiment got the better of you .
 ' One precisely calculated shot to incapacitate me ,
 ' in the hope that it would buy you more time to negotiate my silence . '
 Of course , you couldn 't shoot Magnussen .
 On the night both of us broke into the building , your own husband would become a suspect .
 So ...
 ' You calculated that Magnussen would use the fact of your involvement ... ' rather than sharing the information with the police , as is his MO .

 And then you left the way you came .
 Have I missed anything ?
 How did she save your life ?
 She phoned the ambulance .
 I phoned the ambulance .
 She phoned first .
 ' Emergency , which service do you require ? ' You didn 't find me for another five minutes .

 Left to you , I would have died .
 The average arrival time for a London ambulance is ...
 Did somebody call an ambulance ?
 Eight minutes . Did you bring any morphine ?
 I asked on the phone .
 We were told there was a shooting .
 There was , last week .
 But I believe I 'm bleeding internally , my pulse is very erratic , you may need to restart my heart on the way ...
 Jesus , Sherlock . Come on , Sherlock .
 Argh ! John , John , Magnussen is all that matters now .
 You can trust Mary - she saved my life .
 She shot you .
 Mixed messages , I grant you that ... Argh !
 Sherlock ! Sherlock ! Take him .
 Got him ? Yeah .
 So , have you read it ?
 Would you come here a moment ?
 No , tell me , have you ?
 Just ... Come here .
 No , I 'm fine .
 I 've thought long and hard about what I want to say to you .
 These are prepared words , Mary .
 I 've chosen these words with care .
 OK .
 The problems of your past are your business .
 The problems of your future ... are my privilege .
 It 's all I have to say , it 's all I need to know .
 No , I didn 't read it .
 You don 't even know my name .
 Is " Mary Watson " good enough for you ?
 Yes . Oh my God , yes .
 Then it 's good enough for me , too .
 All this does not mean that I 'm not still basically pissed off with you .
 Hmm , I know , I know .
 I am very pissed off , and it will come out now and then .
 I know , I know , I know .
 You can mow the sodding lawn from now on .
 I do mow the lawn . I do it loads .
 You really don 't .
 I choose the baby 's name .
 Not a chance . OK .
 I 'm glad you 've given up on the Magnussen business . Are you ?
 I 'm still curious , though . He 's hardly your usual kind of puzzle .
 Why do you hate him ?
 Because he attacks people who are different and preys on their secrets .
 Why don 't you ?
 He never causes too much damage to anyone important .
 He 's far too intelligent for that .
 He 's a businessman , that 's all .
 And occasionally useful to us .
 A necessary evil , not a dragon for you to slay .
 A dragon- slayer . Is that what you think of me ? No .
 It 's what you think of yourself .
 Are you two smoking ? ! No .
 It was Mycroft .
 I have , by the way , a job offer I should like you to decline .
 I decline your kind offer .
 I shall pass on your regrets .
 What was it ? Ml6 .
 They want to place you back into Eastern Europe .
 An undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in ,
 I think , about six months .
 Then why don 't you want me to take it ?
 It 's tempting , but on balance , you have more utility closer to home .
 Utility ! How do I have utility ?
 Here be dragons .
 This isn 't agreeing with me .
 I 'm going in . You need low tar . You still smoke like a beginner .
 Also ... ... your loss would break my heart .
 What the hell am I supposed to say to that ? !
 Merry Christmas ? You hate Christmas .
 Yes . Perhaps there was something in the punch .
 Clearly . Go and have some more .
 So you realise that Sherlock got us out here to see his mum and dad for a reason ?
 His lovely mum and dad , a fine example of married life , I get that .
 That is the thing with Sherlock , it 's always the unexpected .
 Oi . Oi ? Mary ?
 Jesus Christ ! Mary ?
 Sit down . Mary , can you hear me ?
 Don 't drink Mary 's tea .
 Or the punch .
 Sherlock ...
 Did you just drug my pregnant wife ? !
 Don 't worry , Wiggins is an excellent chemist .
 I calculated your wife 's dose myself .
 Won 't affect the little one .
 I 'll keep an eye on her .
 He 'll monitor their recovery .
 It 's more or less his day job . What the hell have you done ? !
 A deal with the devil .
 Shouldn 't you be in hospital ?
 I am in hospital .
 This is the canteen . Is it ? In my opinion , yes .
 Have a seat . Thank you .
 I 've been thinking about you .
 I 've been thinking about you . Really ?
 I want to see Appledore .
 Where you keep all the secrets , all the files , everything you 've got on everyone .
 I want you to invite me .
 What makes you think I 'd be so careless ?
 Oh , I think you 're a lot more careless than you let on .
 Am I ?
 It 's the dead- eyed stare that gives it away .
 Except it 's not dead- eyed , is it ?
 You 're reading .
 Portable Appledore .
 How does it work ?
 Built- in flash drive ?
 4G wireless ?
 They 're just ordinary spectacles .
 Yes , they are .




 You underestimate me , Mr Holmes .
 Impress me , then . Show me Appledore .
 Everything is available for a price .
 Are you making me an offer ?
 A Christmas present .
 And what are you giving me for Christmas , Mr Holmes ?
 My brother .
 Oh , Jesus !
 Sherlock , please tell me you haven 't just gone out of your mind .
 I 'd rather keep you guessing .
 Ah , there 's our lift .
 Coming ?
 Where ?
 You want your wife to be safe ? Of course I do .
 Good , because this is going to be incredibly dangerous .
 One false move and we 'll have betrayed the security of the United Kingdom and be in prison for high treason .
 Magnussen is the most dangerous man we 've ever encountered and the odds are comprehensively stacked against us .
 But it 's Christmas ! I feel the same .
 Oh , you mean it 's actually Christmas .
 Did you bring your gun , as I suggested ?
 Why would I bring my gun to your parents ' house for Christmas dinner ? !
 Is it in your coat ? Yes .
 Off we go , then . Where are we going ? Appledore .
 I would offer you a drink , but it 's very rare and expensive .
 Oh , it WAS you .
 Yes , of course .
 Very hard to find a pressure point on you , Mr Holmes .
 The drugs thing I never believed for a moment .
 Anyway , you wouldn 't care if it was exposed , would you ?
 But look how you care about John Watson .
 Your damsel in distress .
 You put me in a fire , for leverage ? !
 Oh , I would never let you burn , Dr Watson .
 I had people standing by . I 'm not a murderer .
 Unlike your wife .
 Let me explain how leverage works , Dr Watson .
 For those who understand these things ,
 Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful man in the country .
 Well , apart from me .
 Mycroft 's pressure point is his junkie detective brother , Sherlock .
 Sherlock 's pressure point is his best friend , John Watson .
 John Watson 's pressure point is his wife .
 I own John Watson 's wife , I own Mycroft .
 He 's what I 'm getting for Christmas .
 It 's an exchange , not a gift .
 Forgive me , but ...
 I already seem to have it .
 It 's password protected .
 In return for the password , you will give me any material in your possession pertaining to the woman I know as Mary Watson .
 Oh , she 's bad , that one . So many dead people .
 You should see what I 've seen . I don 't need to see it .
 You might enjoy it , though .
 I enjoy it .
 Then why don 't you show us ?
 Show you Appledore ? The secret vaults .
 Is that what you want ?
 I want everything you 've got on Mary .
 You know , I honestly expected something good .
 Oh , I think you 'll find the contents of that laptop ...
 Include a GPS locator .
 By now your brother will have noticed the theft and the security services will be converging on this house .
 Having arrived , they 'll find top- secret information in my hands and they have every justification to search my vaults .
 They will discover further information of this kind and I will be imprisoned .
 You would be exonerated and restored to your smelly little apartment to solve crimes with Mr and Mrs Psychopath .
 Mycroft has been looking for this opportunity for a long time .
 He 'll be a very , very proud big brother .
 The fact that you know it 's going to happen isn 't going to stop it .
 Then why am I smiling ?
 Ask me .
 Why are you smiling ?
 Because Sherlock Holmes has made one enormous mistake , which will destroy the lives of everyone he loves .
 And everything he holds dear .
 Let me show you the Appledore vaults .
 The entrance to my vaults .
 This is where I keep you all .
 OK , so where are the vaults , then ?
 Vaults ? What vaults ?
 There are no vaults beneath this building .
 They 're all in here .
 The Appledore vaults are my mind palace .
 You know about mind palaces , don 't you , Sherlock ?
 How to store information so you never forget it , by picturing it .
 I just sit here , I close my eyes and down I go to my vaults .
 I can go anywhere inside my vaults .
 My memories .
 I 'll look at the files on Mrs Watson .
 Hmm .
 Oh , this is one of my favourites .
 Oh , it 's so exciting .
 All those wet jobs for the ClA .
 Ooh , she 's gone a bit freelance now , bad girl .
 Oh , she 's so wicked .
 I can really see why you like her .
 You see ?
 So there are no documents , you don 't actually have anything here ?
 Oh , sometimes I send out for something , if I really need it , but mostly I just remember it all .
 I don 't understand .
 You should have that on a T- shirt . You just remember it all ?
 It 's all about knowledge , everything is .
 Knowing is owning .
 But if you just know it , then you don 't have proof .
 Proof ? What would I need proof for ?
 I 'm in news , you moron .
 I don 't have to prove it , I just have to print it .
 Speaking of news ...
 You 'll both be heavily featured tomorrow .
 Trying to sell state secrets to me .
 Tut tut .
 Let 's go outside . They 'll be here shortly .
 Can 't wait to see you arrested .
 Sherlock , do we have a plan ?
 Sherlock ?
 They 're taking their time , aren 't they ?
 I still don 't understand .
 And there 's the back of the T- shirt .
 You just know things - how does that work ?
 I just love your little soldier face . I 'd like to punch it .
 Bring it over here a minute .
 Come on . For Mary . Bring me your face .
 Lean forward a bit and stick your face out .
 Please .
 Now , can I flick it ?
 Look at me . Can I flick your face ?
 I just love doing this .
 I could do it all day . Well , it works like this , John .
 I know who Mary hurt and killed .
 I know where to find people who hate her .
 I know where they live , I know their phone numbers .
 All in my mind palace , all of it .
 I could phone them right now and tear your whole life down ... ... and I will , unless you let me flick your face .
 This is what I do to people .
 This is what I do to whole countries .
 Just because I know .
 Can I do your eye now ?
 See if you can keep it open , hmm ?
 Come on , for Mary . Keep it open .
 Sherlock ?
 Let him . I 'm sorry , just ... let him .
 Hmm ? Come on , eye open .
 It 's difficult , isn 't it ?
 Janine managed to once .
 She makes the funniest noises .
 Sherlock Holmes and John Watson , stand away from that man .
 Here we go , Mr Holmes .
 To clarify , Appledore 's vaults only exist in your mind , nowhere else , just there ?
 They 're not real , they never have been .
 Sherlock Holmes and John Watson , step away !
 It 's fine , they 're harmless .
 ' Target is not armed , I repeat target is not armed . '
 Sherlock , what do we do ?
 Nothing . There is nothing to be done .
 Oh , I 'm not a villain , I have no evil plan .
 I 'm a businessman , acquiring assets .
 You happen to be one of them .
 Sorry , no chance for you to be a hero this time , Mr Holmes .
 Sherlock Holmes and John Watson , stand away from that man .
 Do it now !
 Oh , do your research .
 I 'm not a hero , I 'm a high- functioning sociopath .
 Merry Christmas !
 ' Man down , man down . '
 Get away from me , John ! Stay well back !
 Christ , Sherlock !
 Don 't fire ! Do not fire on Sherlock Holmes !
 Do not fire !
 Oh Christ , Sherlock !
 Give my love to Mary .
 Tell her she 's safe now .
 Oh , Sherlock .
 What have you done ?
 As my colleague is fond of remarking , this country sometimes needs a blunt instrument .
 Equally , it sometimes needs a dagger , a scalpel wielded with precision and without remorse .
 There will always come a time when we need Sherlock Holmes .
 If this is some expression of familial sentiment ...
 Don 't be absurd .
 I am not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion .
 You know what happened to the other one .
 In any event , there is no prison in which we could incarcerate Sherlock without causing a riot on a daily basis .
 The alternative , however , would require your approval .
 Hardly merciful , Mr Holmes .
 Regrettably , Lady Smallwood , my brother is a murderer .
 You will look after him for me , won 't you ?
 Hmm .
 Don 't worry . I 'll keep him in trouble .
 That 's my girl .
 Since this is likely to be the last conversation I 'll have with John Watson , would you mind if we took a moment ?
 So here we are .
 William Sherlock Scott Holmes .
 Sorry ?
 That 's the whole of it . If you 're looking for baby names .
 No , we 've had a scan , we 're pretty sure it 's a girl .
 Oh . OK .
 Yeah .
 You know , actually , I can 't think of a single thing to say .
 No , neither can I.
 The game is over .
 The game is never over , John .
 But there may be some new players now .
 That 's OK , the East Wind takes us all in the end .
 What 's that ?
 It 's a story my brother told me when we were kids .
 The East Wind is a terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path .
 It seeks out the unworthy and plucks them from the earth .
 That was generally me .
 Nice ( ! ) He 's a rubbish big brother .
 So what about you , then ?
 Where are you actually going now ?
 Oh , some undercover work in Eastern Europe .
 For how long ?
 Six months , my brother estimates .
 He 's never wrong .
 And then what ?
 Who knows ?
 John , there 's something I should say , I 've meant to say always and I never have .
 Since it 's unlikely we 'll ever meet again , I might as well say it now .
 Sherlock is actually a girl 's name .
 It 's not .
 It was worth a try .
 We 're not naming our daughter after you .
 Oh , I think it could work .
 To the very best of times , John .
 ' Smith brings it inside . This looks good .
 ' Cassandra comes in for a shot . Ooh , he missed it ! '
 Oi , there 's something wrong with the telly .
 There 's something wrong with the telly , mate .
 Who 's that ?
 Did you miss me ? Did you miss me ?
 Did you miss me ? Did you miss me ? Did you miss me ?
 How is this possible ?
 We don 't know , but it 's on every screen in the country .
 Every screen simultaneously .
 Has the Prime Minister been told ?
 And Mycroft ?
 But that 's not possible . That is simply not possible .
 What 's happened ?
 Sir ? It 's your brother .
 Mycroft ?
 ' Hello , little brother . How 's the exile going ? '
 I 've only been gone four minutes .
 Well , I certainly hope you 've learnt your lesson .
 ' As it turns out , you 're needed . '
 Oh , for God 's sake , make up your mind !
 Who needs me this time ?
 ' Did you miss me ? Did you miss me ?
 Did you miss me ? Did you miss me ?
 ' Did you miss me ?
 Did you miss me ?
 Did you miss me ? Did you miss me ? '
 England .
 But he 's dead . I mean , you told me he was dead , Moriarty ?
 Absolutely . Blew his own brains out .
 So how can he be back ?
 Well if he is , he 'd better wrap up warm .
 There 's an East Wind coming .
