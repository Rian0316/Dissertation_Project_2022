 But you do usually come , though , right ?
 Yeah . I mean , with other guys .
 But not with me ?
 Well , this is quite a surprise .
 Who gave you these orgasms , then ?
 Tom Baker , Joe Fuchart , Ryan Bailey ...
 Okay , I get it . I get it .
 - What did they do different ? - I don 't know . Maybe do some research .

 [ DJ ] We have Dr. Jean Milburn here to talk about her new book ,

 She wrote this as a response to working on campus at Moordale Secondary , which got some pretty bad press recently following a chlamydia outbreak , and the performance of a so- called " sex musical . "
 [ DJ chuckles ]
 So , Dr. Milburn , tell us about the book .
 Well , I was shocked at the ineptitude of the SRE curriculums in schools .
 So I created this easy- to- read manual to help empower our teenagers , and their parents , as they become sexually active young adults .
 Sounds a bit racy .
 Well , if , by racy , you mean highly researched and completely essential to the health and well- being of our children , then , yes , I suppose it is .
 [ DJ ] A lot of people will be sitting at home thinking ,
 Thanks .

 [ Jean ]
 They 're not still going on about " Sex School , " are they ? Mm .
 It 's as if no one in this town 's had sex before . [ chuckles ]
 Okay , thanks for the tea , Joe !
 I better go .
 I don 't wanna be late for my first day .
 If you 're not gonna finish your tea , at least take your lunch .
 Oh .
 It 's a fancy sandwich . Cheese ham .
 - [ Maeve ]
 Wow .
 - Mm .
 Hm . Thank you . See you later .
 Have a nice day .
 - Bye . - [ Isaac ] Good luck !
 [ door closes ]
 Enough of the yearning looks , you pillock . Just tell her you like her already .
 [ car horn honks ]
 - Hi ! - [ Aimee ] Hi !
 Nice ride , Aimes .
 Thanks ! Mum thinks I 'm safer driving than getting the bus , so here we are .
 Okay .
 - [ goat bleats ]
 - [ Maeve ] Who 's this ?
 [ whispers ] Maeve , that 's Steve .
 No , Aimee , the goat .
 Oh ! She 's our commitment animal .
 Apparently , pets bring couples closer together .
 We didn 't think about who was gonna look after her when we 're at school , so ...
 - [ Aimee ] Yeah . Right !
 - [ car engine starting ]
 [ woman ]
 Whoa !
 [ screams ] [ grunts ]
 Hey !
 Sorry , love !
 - Aimes ? - [ Aimee ] You okay ?
 - [ woman ] No ! - Yeah .
 Let 's try that again , shall we ?
 Oatcake , what 's on your face ?
 It 's a mustache .
 I 've been growing it all summer , but somebody has been too busy having sex with their new boyfriend to notice .
 Uh , I was hoping it was a phase .
 And Adam and I aren 't having sex .
 We 're just doing hand jobs and stuff .
 Hand jobs is sex . Virginity is a construct .
 Yes ! Yes , I know !
 But I really want to go all the way !
 What is it you want to say to me ?
 I think you need to be careful . [ sighs ]
 And I think you need to make more of an effort with him .
 Okay . Okay , I will .
 Hey , I forgot to tell you . I saw Maeve the other day .
 Why are you telling me about Maeve ?
 - I thought you might wanna know ?
 - She hasn 't responded to my message .
 She 's made it abundantly clear she doesn 't want me in her life , so , no .
 I don 't need to know what Maeve is doing anymore .
 Well , I just ...
 Oh my God !
 - The fuck is that ?
 - [ both scream ]
 - [ Eric ] Adam , you fucking idiot !
 - [ Otis ] Fuck !
 Whoo !
 Ha ha !
 [ whimpers ]
 All right , New Kid ?
 What is that on your face ?
 [ funky music playing ]
 [ girl 1 ] What 's Adam Groff doing back ?
 I heard his mum bribed the school to let him back .
 And you know he 's gay now , right ?
 [ scoffs ]
 You okay ?
 Yeah , I 'm fine .
 [ funky music continues ]
 [ sighs ]
 Oatcake , you all right ?
 I 'm A- okay , Eric . I 'm fine . I 'm chillaxed !
 [ chuckles ] To the max !
 Okay then , Mr. Mustache .
 So you guys didn 't speak much over summer ?
 No . I haven 't heard from him since last term .
 - I always thought you two would make up .
 - We 're not fighting . We 're just not friends anymore .
 Why 's there a camera crew here ?
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 You 've grown ! [ chuckles ] Massive !
 Hey , hey , hey ! Whoa , whoa , girls ! Why is there a goat on campus ?
 She 's mine and Steve 's commitment animal .
 Right . You didn 't think of a hamster ?
 Or , um , a terrapin ?
 Or a worm farm ?
 How 's Eugene ? [ sighs ]
 I mean , long- distance is hard , but I think if we play our cards right , we 'll both end up at Oxford .
 Did I tell you he speaks six languages ?
 Yes .
 Here are some of the students currently attendingwhat has been dubbed
 [ journalist ]
 Oh , excuse me , young man , what can you tell us about last year 's chlamydia outbreak on campus ?
 [ whispers ] Please speak .

 [ sniffs ]
 Uh , hi . Hi .



 [ Eric chuckles ]
 Do you have an opinion , young man ?

 not a chlamydia outbreak . Your facts are wrong .
 - Otis , shh ! We 're on TV . - [ girl ]
 Yeah , shut up , Milburn !
 - Are you Dr. Jean Milburn 's son ? - Yes . Yes , he is that .
 Are the students of Moordale as depraved as your mother makes out in her new book ?
 I think my mum 's book is an honest insight into teenagers today , and people should probably read it before speculating .


 [ bell ringing ]
 It 's true . I do love an empty school .
 - But it 's nice to see the students . - Priceless .
 I used to teach geography before I became a headmaster .
 I 'm also very experienced in teaching history and ...
 Thanks for coming in , Mr. Groff . We will consider your application .
 Are you actually going to consider my application ?
 No .
 I 'm sorry . The controversy surrounding Moordale Secondary is too fresh .
 You 're also far too experienced for this role .
 This is the fifth teaching position that I 've applied for , and frankly , I 'm running out of options .
 It 's still a no .


 - [ music stops ]
 - [ mic feedback ] Good morning , Moordale !
 How is everyone feeling today ?
 Really good !
 I am your new head teacher , Mrs. Haddon , but you can call me Hope .
 [ whispers ] She 's cool . Teachers aren 't supposed to be cool .
 The first thing you need to know about me is that I used to be sitting where you are now .
 Literally .
 [ chuckles ]
 Yeah , I went to Moordale too .
 - I love her lipstick . It 's so bold . - Mm .
 [ Hope ] I 've achieved a lot since then .
 Two degrees , teaching positions at some of the country 's top institutions , and by 28 , I became the youngest head teacher in the UK .
 But the years I spent in this building were the best of my life .
 This school not only encouraged me to excel academically , but it truly allowed me to find my purpose .
 Which is why it 's been so hurtful to read some of the horrible things written about Moordale in the press .
 I don 't know what went wrong or how we ended up here , but I do know it changes today .

 I can promise you this .
 If you work hard and you take pride in your school ,
 I will get Moordale and your futures back on track .
 - [ girl ]
 Yeah !
 - Oh !
 - Wow ! - Come on , girl !
 [ Hope ] So let me hear you .
 Let 's get Moordale ...
 Back on track !
 Let 's get Moordale ...
 - I love her . - [ crowd ] Back on track !
 She 's like Joan of Arc , but cooler .
 - Back on track ! - Yes !
 [ music continues ]
 - Wow !
 - [ crowd cheering ]
 - [ Hope ] Thank you all !
 - Come on . To a great start and a great week . And oh !
 Can Otis Milburn and Maeve Wiley come to my office , please ?
 You get to meet her in the flesh .
 Maeve !
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 Hi , Jakob !
 You 're looking well .
 Oh , this ?
 [ chuckles ]
 Funny story .
 You impregnated me .
 Surprise !
 Oh shit .
 [ sighs ]
 [ car engine starting ]
 [ tools clanking ]
 Damn it ! Shit , shit , shit !
 How come you 're back in school ?
 I wanna learn some shit , don 't I ?
 You must be Jackson Marchetti , famed head boy .
 That would be me .
 Of course . Of course . Acting , swimming extraordinaire .
 I 'm re- enrolling . I think I need to take some kind of test .
 Ah , yes , Mr. Groff 's son .
 My receptionist has your paperwork .
 Hi , guys . You can go straight in .
 [ whimsical music continues ]
 Jackson , can I get you to come back a bit later ?
 It was really lovely to meet you .
 [ Hope ] I 've heard a lot about the two of you .
 Sit down .
 Don 't worry . You 're not in any trouble .
 An on- campus sex clinic for teenagers is rather entrepreneurial , in my opinion .
 Shows a lot of business savvy .
 Is it something you 're wanting to pursue ?
 N ... no . No . We don 't run the clinic anymore .
 [ inhales sharply ] We 've realized it wasn 't very ethical , and we ...
 We sort of stopped being friends . We grew apart .
 [ Hope ]
 Oh .
 That 's a shame .
 Anyway , I just wanted to say that Moordale is here to encourage your passions .
 It would be great if you could keep me in the loop of any further business endeavors you come up with in the future .
 [ Maeve chuckles ]
 That 's it .
 [ Otis sighs ] Okay . [ clears throat ]
 Thank you .
 [ Hope ] Oh , Otis ...
 Tell your mum I 'm really looking forward to reading her book .
 I will ... Yeah . Yeah .
 - I thought we were screwed . - [ chuckles ] Me too .
 [ Maeve chuckles ] - Shit . Well , thank God .
 - Yeah .
 [ Otis ] So why aren 't we friends anymore ?
 Nice beard .
 What 's your point ?
 Nothing .
 We 're just in different places .
 If that 's what you wanna call it .

 Bye , Otis .
 Maeve ? Yeah ?
 It 's called a mustache .
 Yeah , no shit .

 I 've , uh , never measured .

 - But you haven 't helped . - [ deep voice ]

 Milburn ! It 's only you .

 You are no such thing !
 - [ beeps ]
 - You left a gap in the market .
 - " Pubes are overrated " ? - Yeah .
 " To win the race , come on the face " ?
 Big- time .
 Are you just getting all your advice from porn ?
 Look , no offense , mate , but I 've had a lot more sex than you .
 Well , I 'm going to have to report you because this is dangerous and it 's wrong .
 [ phone chimes ]
 [ Ruby ] Shoot !
 [ Kyle scoffs ]
 What are you doing in here , anyway ?
 Nothing .
 [ suspenseful music playing ]
 [ Otis ]
 Kyle .
 [ murmuring ]
 [ Kyle grunts ]
 Ruby ! What are you doing here ?
 Well , well , well .
 Ruby Matthews is secretly shagging Otis Milburn .
 [ chuckles ] - Kyle ... - People are gonna love this !
 Kyle , wait ! Please don 't tell anyone about this .
 Then you can 't tell anyone about me being the Sex King .
 Unless you want everyone to know about your secret sex affair .
 [ chuckles ]
 Laters , losers .
 Well done .
 [ funky music playing ]
 Ruby ! Ruby ! Ruby , wait !
 I ... I have to tell somebody . He could hurt people !
 Otis , do you like having sex with me ?
 Mm .
 Do you like it when I touch you ?
 [ inhales ] Would you like it if I were to suddenly stop touching you forever ?
 No .
 - Then you will keep your mouth shut . - Mm .
 Remember , five feet behind me at all times .
 [ funky music continues ]
 [ music fades ]
 Someone else is giving out sex advice on campus .
 Who ?
 I can 't say .
 What do you mean , " You can 't say " ? We tell each other everything !
 You know it stays between me and you .
 Okay . Okay , fine .
 - It 's Kyle .
 - Hmm ?
 He 's charging people for advice and calling himself the Sex King .
 Look at my big tits !
 - I mean , we have to tell someone . - [ Otis ] We can 't .
 Why not ?
 Because if I do , he 's gonna tell people I 'm hooking up with Ruby .
 Sorry , what ?
 Look , I haven 't told you , but we 've been having casual sex all over summer .
 She wants it to be a secret , and we haven 't seen each other that much .
 [ laughing ]
 Are you kidding ?
 Hey , what 's that on your neck ?

 Oh my God !
 [ Eric gasping ]
 What ? How ? When ?
 Okay , okay , okay .
 So , it was Olivia 's party .
 You were supposed to come but decided to watch movies with Adam .


 But then ...
 - Milburn !
 - Oh !
 Oh .
 Hi , Ruby , what are you ?
 I 'm early 2000s Christina Aguilera . Very cool . I 'm macaroni cheese .
 - Shut up and have sex with me . - What are you sad about tonight ?
 I 'm a teenage girl , Otis . I 'm always sad .
 [ both moaning ]
 Wait . Why were you macaroni cheese ?
 That 's not the point , Eric !
 - Sorry . - I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you before .
 I think I 'm still figuring it out myself .
 You 're having casual sex with the most popular girl in school ?
 I know !
 - I 'm so proud of you ! - It 's amazing .
 - I 'm so proud of you ! - And there 's no strings .
 - So nobody gets hurt .
 - Mm .
 Wahey !
 Whoa !
 What you gonna do about Kyle ?
 I guess it 's not my responsibility anymore ?
 [ Kyle ]
 Ow !
 Oh !

 [ boy ]
 It does look bad .
 You got a problem ?
 [ splutters ] No , Adam . Sorry , Adam .
 [ all gasp ]
 What are you doing ?
 They ... they were talking about me .
 But that doesn 't mean you can hurt people , Adam .
 No , I ...
 I can 't do this again .
 What are you all looking at ?

 [ sighs ]
 [ man ] Hey , hey , little bro !
 How was the , uh , job interview ?
 Did you smash it ?
 Yeah , yes , it was great . Um , I start tomorrow .
 Thank fuck !
 Hey , tell me something .
 What 's an average teacher 's salary these days ?
 You know , ballpark . We were talking at work , and we haven 't got a clue .
 - Well , it starts ... - Mm .
 Taste that . Go on , it 's a protein shake .
 - How fucking good is that ? - [ coughs ] - Come on !
 Eh ?
 - [ phone chimes ]
 Oh shit . You remember James McBride ? He 's only gone and bought a yacht .
 Now the wife 's dropping fucking hints .
 Know what the secret to a happy marriage is ?
 I 'm not really the best person to answer that , Peter .
 Well , that and keeping the toilet seat down , but mostly fucking money ... [ exclaims ]
 [ Peter chuckles ]
 Money .
 I 'm so wired after court today ! I fucking destroyed the defendant .
 I mean , I just like ... [ pops lips ] ... dismembered them .
 [ grunts , snarls ]
 Come on . Quick game of squash , Chub- Chub ?
 Oink , oink .
 [ chuckles ]
 Nice day at school ?
 Yeah , it was all right . Your book is causing quite the stir .
 - Press there and everything . - Really ?
 - It 's not that controversial . - I know .
 Mm .
 Wanna watch a movie tonight ?
 How about
 - Or ... - [ phone chimes ] ?
 You choose .

 I 'm going out .
 Where ?
 I have homework with Eric . - I 'll be home later .
 - Right .
 Oh , Otis .
 I 've got a scan tomorrow . Will you come with me ?
 Please ?
 Sure .
 But you have to tell him , Mum .
 [ whispers ] I will .
 [ knocking at door ]
 Go away , Mum .
 You 're not wanking , are you ?
 Are you okay ?
 Do you wanna go and smash some shit ?
 Or we could talk instead ?
 I 'm ...
 I 'm not good at talking .
 When my mum died , I was angry all the time .
 My counselor told me to take my anger out on a pillow , so I punched my pillow every night for months .
 But in the end , it turned out that talking was the only thing that helped .
 What happened today ?
 I ... I don 't want people to think I 'm a pussy .
 - 'Cause you 're dating a guy ? - I 'm still a man .
 Yeah . Of course you 're still a man .
 [ sighs ]
 But you know , men don 't need to hit things , and men can date other men .
 - You need to tell Eric how you feel .
 - I don 't ...
 I don 't know how .
 Well , I think you should try .
 Ya pussy !
 [ chuckles ]
 Can we do the punching pillow thing first ?
 Absolutely . Bring it here .
 So what you have do is just take a deep breath in .
 - Mm- hmm .
 - Get yourself all pumped up .

 - Hello !

 - [ car horn honks ]
 - [ car horn honks ]
 - Shh .
 [ Otis grunts ]
 - [ Otis grunts , groans ] - Okay .
 [ both moaning ]
 [ Otis ]
 Oh !
 Ow !
 Ow , ow , ow !
 - Stop . - Careful of my hair .
 Okay , this isn 't working . Can 't we go to your house ? Or mine ?
 Houses are off- limits . It 's too risky .
 I get that you want us to be a secret , but it feels like you 're embarrassed to even be seen near me .
 I 'm a very private person , Otis .
 [ sighs ]
 I think you 're embarrassed .
 Okay , fine . I 'm embarrassed !
 I am hot and popular , and you are a badly- dressed stick man with a creepy mustache .
 You said you liked my mustache . And I was good at sex .
 You are good at sex , Otis , but that doesn 't mean I want to be seen in public with you .
 [ exhales ]
 Well , I don 't wanna be seen in public with someone who is mean and uses people for their good sex skills !
 I have more self- respect than that .
 We 're done .
 [ " Hour of Deepest Need " by Ezra Furman playing ] [ car engine starting ]

 I know , baby .

 [ beep ]
 Hi , Mum , it 's Maeve .
 Listen , I know you 're not speaking to me , but I really think we should talk .
 Call me back ?
 I miss you .
 [ Isaac ] Hey , Maeve .
 Can I talk to you about something ?
 Yeah .
 What 's wrong ?
 Mum still isn 't answering me .
 She hates me .
 You did the right thing , and don 't forget that .
 What do you wanna talk about ?
 I wanted to talk about the ...
 Um ...
 I wanted to talk about ...
 Breakfast .
 - [ chuckles ] - Raspberry or strawberry jam ?
 Uh , raspberry .
 Well , good news , we 've got neither .
 Mm .
 Very good , very good . I 'll be out in a second .
 [ clears throat ]
 [ Hope ]
 I basically just wanted to get to know you a bit , seeing as we 'll be working closely together .
 You know , I was once head girl here .
 I get the responsibility .
 Yeah , it 's fun .
 And challenging , I hope .
 [ Jackson ]
 Hm . The thing is , I 'm really wanting to inject some proper passion back into this place .
 To create an environment where everyone can excel , no matter what path they choose to go down .
 [ knocking at door , door opens ]
 Hope , the press are here for your interview .
 Thank you . I 'll be right there .
 I wanted to share with you the new school values .
 I 'm excited to hear your feedback when you get a chance .
 Hi !
 Oh , and , Jackson ,
 I 'm going to need you to take this role a bit more seriously than you have been .
 I 'm not really into the whole " cool guy " thing if you know what I mean .
 Not really .
 You will .
 She 's nuts .
 - Cal , it 's PE . Are you coming ? - Yeah , I 'll be right there .
 - Whoa !
 [ chuckles ] - Hey .
 - Oh .
 Oops .
 - Whoa !
 I 'm ... Okay , I 'm in your way , obviously .
 It 's okay .
 After you , good human .
 [ sighs ]
 - Hey . - Hey .
 I don 't like it when I hurt people .
 - Then don 't .
 - Yeah .
 I don 't know why I do it .
 I just get so angry , but ...
 I wanna change .
 Okay .

 [ indistinct chattering ]
 You 're a poofter now , Groff ?
 [ boys laughing ]
 Yeah , I am a bit of a poofter now .
 Is that all right with you ?
 Yeah , mate . I think it 's cool .
 Yeah , congrats , dude .
 You don 't need to congratulate someone on being gay .

 Dude , why are you naked ?
 Don 't look at my dick !

 No . No . Why did you say that ?

 [ Hendricks ] Right , fine . Go on .
 See , this is exactly why you shouldn 't be bringing livestock into school .
 - My mum 's looking after her tomorrow . - Good .
 Okay , this is the only goat you should be seeing in school .
 Uh , it 's a goatee .
 It 's my new look . Hands up who likes it .
 [ panting ]
 Oh God . Oh God .
 [ panting ]
 [ Dex groaning ]

 - What the f ... - [ Dex screaming ]
 [ Hendricks ] Fatty acids !
 - Okay ... - Sir , Dex Thompson 's naked !

 [ " Oh Yeah " by Yello continues ]

 - [ chanting ] - [ Dex ] Fuck !

 Why are you naked ?
 Dex ?
 - [ Dex ] I need to borrow this . - No , not my goat .
 Not my goat .
 - I 'll bring it back as soon as I can . - Don 't take her !
 - I 'll bring it back . - Please !
 - I 'm sorry .
 - Please !

 [ typing ]
 No . No , no , no !
 No , no , no , no !
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 I think I just lost all my work .
 Yeah , the computers are terrible . Maybe get a laptop .
 [ door opens , closes ]
 - Hey . Hey , have you seen Kyle ? - No .
 [ goat bleating ]
 [ Dex ] I should never have listened to the fucking Sex King !
 [ sniffles , exhales ]
 Dex , are you okay ?
 I should never have listened to the Sex King .
 Who 's the Sex King ?
 Kyle .
 [ Jean grunts ]
 Okay , okay , okay .
 [ groaning ]
 - [ gasps ] - [ Jakob ] Hey !
 Are you stalking me , woman ?
 No ! No , don 't be ridiculous .
 I just happened to be driving by this place where you work .
 You 've driven past 15 times ! I can see you out the window .
 What 's going on ?
 [ exhales sharply ]
 Can we talk ?
 - If you stop being scary .
 - [ sighs ]
 [ Jakob ] Yes .
 - Are you stepping out ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 Good .
 [ Otis ]
 how did we get here ?
 I was measuring my penis .
 Mm .
 I told him to do that . So what 're your stats , then ?
 I was interrupted .
 And I don 't wanna know . What if I do have a small penis , and I can never please a woman ?

 Maybe you can look at it for me and tell me if it 's small .
 - Yeah ! Sure . - No !
 No !
 No !
 No , nobody 's inspecting anything because penis size isn 't important .
 No !
 [ scoffs ]
 Only guys with small dicks say that .
 Dex , you shouldn 't compare the size of your dick to anyone else 's .
 It 's irrelevant and unhelpful .
 You 'd also be surprised how many guys have insecurities about the size of their penis and exaggerated views as to what other male genitals look like .
 It 's true . I wish mine was straighter .
 It sort of bends to the side a bit .
 It 's ... it 's wonky , you know ?
 It 's not wonky .
 It 's unique .
 [ chuckles ]
 Thanks , Milburn . That means a lot .
 Well , that 's very touching .
 Dex , why did you say you 'll never please a woman ?
 [ laughs ]
 He can 't make his girlfriend come during sex .
 What kind of sex ?
 You know , just normal fucking .
 Okay . Well , most women struggle to orgasm from penetration alone .
 - [ scoffs ] Really ?
 - Yeah .
 You heard of the clitoris ?
 Sure .
 Might be time to get acquainted with it . Ask your girlfriend what she likes .
 And remember that orgasm doesn 't have to be the main goal of sex .
 You can have fun and be creative .
 Could you clarify ?
 You have ten fingers and a tongue , Dex .
 Use your imagination .
 [ Kyle ]
 Wow .
 You guys are actually really good at giving out sex advice .
 Maybe keep this on the down- low ? Could be bad for my business .
 Hey . I 'm going to lost property , but thanks for the help .
 Oh !
 And , hey , Otis , I heard about you and Ruby .
 Don 't know how you pulled that off , but congrats .
 - You and Ruby are a thing .
 - [ splutters ] Well , we 're not anymore .
 We were for a bit , but it was casual , you know ?
 No feelings .
 No feelings . Sounds cool .
 Thanks for telling everyone , Kyle .
 Well , I didn 't tell anyone .
 [ chuckles ]
 But now everyone knows about you and Ruby , guess I can carry on being the Sex King .
 Au revoir , loser !
 It means exactly the opposite of that , Kyle !
 [ Jean ] I didn 't know whether I was going to keep it .
 I was confused , and
 I kept putting it off .
 Then I started writing my book .
 And I enjoyed every second of that , and I got immersed .
 - How could you keep this from me ?
 - I wanted to tell you , I did .
 I ... But the ...
 The longer I waited , the harder it got .
 I 'm having a baby ?
 [ exhales sharply ]
 I don 't want you to feel backed into a corner .
 I have decided to keep this baby , and I feel empowered by that choice , and ...
 I only need you to be involved if you feel it 's something that you would like .
 Do you want me to be involved ?
 Of course I do .
 But only if you want to be involved .
 [ scoffs ]
 I have a scan tonight at 4 : 30 .
 - At Moordale Community Hospital . You ... - Thank you .
 I really have to think about this .
 - Of course .
 - Yeah .
 [ Hope on video ] [ knocking at door ]
 - Come in .

 The clinic is still running in the old toilet block .
 Maeve and I have nothing to do with it , but it 's still happening , and it 's dangerous .
 Students shouldn 't be getting advice from students , but they still need help , so hopefully , you can provide the right service on campus .
 Thank you for telling me , Otis .
 [ funky music playing ]
 Miss Sands , I did type up my essay , but the school computer broke .
 - Can I get an extension ? - Okay . Don 't let it happen again .
 Oh , uh , Maeve , have a look at applying for that .
 You 're the perfect candidate .
 Adam , I marked your test this afternoon . Here 's your timetable .
 Ah !
 What set are you in ?
 Take a guess .
 Eric . Eric ! Everybody knows about me and Ruby .
 Did you tell anyone ?
 I accidentally told Adam .
 And I told Ola .
 - I told Lily . - And I told everyone .
 This was supposed to stay between me and you !
 What are you doing here ?
 I sold my first painting , so no beans on toast for us tonight .
 We are going out for pizza !
 Oh , well done . Always knew you would , genius .
 Apparently , you 're secretly sleeping with Otis Milburn . [ scoffs ]
 Ugh ! As if .
 It 's true .
 [ Maeve , Isaac laugh ]
 [ Maeve ] No , it 's really not . It 's really not .
 [ phone ringing ]
 [ Maeve ] Mum ? Hi , how are you ?

 [ disconnect tone ]
 [ scoffs ]
 - We have a friendly relationship . - Yeah , but not that friendly .
 [ moaning ]
 [ both panting ]
 I didn 't come , but that was so much better !
 [ mouthing ]
 [ indistinct chattering ]
 So now everyone knows anyway ,
 I was thinking we could keep seeing each other ?
 You know , because I like having sex with you .
 No more cars or toilets ?
 No , no more cars or toilets . ... [ crowd cheering ]

 [ excavator beeping ]
 - Thanks for the tip , Otis . - Did you tell her to do this ?
 It needed to end .
 So it 's really done , then .
 Yeah , it really is .
 [ all exclaiming ]
