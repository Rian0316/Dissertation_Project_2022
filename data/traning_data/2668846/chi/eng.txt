 00 : 00 : 02, 978 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 241 You 'll never believe what happened to me at work today .
 Hmm ?
 This old guy was choking on his food , and I saved his life . You 're kidding . Did you Heimlich him ?
 No .
 I said , " Oh , my God , I think that old guy 's choking , " and then one of the busboys Heimlich 'ed him .

 You 're a hero .
 Yeah , that the point of the story .
 Oh , yeah , speaking of work , do you know if you have Thursday night off ? Um , I think so .
 Why ? What do you mean , why ? It 's Valentine 's Day .
 Oh , right .
 Yeah , we can do something .
 You could be a little more into it .
 No , I 'm into it , I 'm into it .
 Just , there 's so much pressure to make the night special , and it never works out .
 Okay , well , this time it 's going to be different .
 Because I am like a romance ninja .
 You don 't see it coming , and then bam !
 Romance , watch out , hearts , kisses , love , ooh- ya !
 You know , sometimes I think I 've made you so much cooler than you used to be , and then you go and do that .

 So , in conclusion ,
 I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chilies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste .
 I concur , but you changed the subject .
 What are we doing for Valentine 's Day ? Oh , you caught that , did you ?

 Original Air Date on February 14 , 2013 ( quietly ) : Okay . Okay .

 Okay .
 Okay .
 Okay !

 Okay .

 ( sighs )
 Everything okay ?

 Bernie 's a little cranky since she 's been working , like , 17 hours a day .
 And I 've got a lot on my plate , too , because I 've been busting my tail playing Hey , Stuart , you got anything going on for Valentine 's Day ?
 Not really .
 Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white- knuckling it till morning .
 What do you got going on ?
 Oh , well , I was going to spend the night with my special little lady , but , uh , she got worms , and then I had to take her to the vet .
 There must be something we can do .
 Well , uh , how about you keep the store open late , and we throw a party for all the people who don 't have dates ?
 That actually sounds kind of nice .
 Yeah , the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself .
 That 's good .
 Or maybe something a little less " hand in the pants . "
 Oh , Alex , excellent .
 I have a research problem that I believe you can help with .
 Oh , Dr. Cooper , thank you .
 I 've been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work .
 Oh , no , no .
 That 's not going to happen , no .
 What I need you to do is find a Valentine 's gift for my girlfriend .
 You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you .
 Well , I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents .
 Now , here is ...
 Let 's see .
 This is ...

 This is about $2, 000 .
 Um , I think she likes monkeys and the color gray .
 Contribute to my work .
 ( laughs )
 Ah , kids say the darnedest things . Hey , you coming to lunch ?
 Yeah , one second . Come here .
 I want to show you something .
 What you looking at ?
 Well , I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine 's Day since she 's been such a pain in the ass .
 You can 't find a card that says that ? Check it out .
 I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart 1/ 1, 000 the size of a grain of sand .
 ( laughing ) :
 Oh , that 's cool .
 A micro- valentine for a microbiologist . From her micro- husband .

 That is amazing .
 How long did this take you ?
 Mmm , about 12 hours .
 I pulled an all- nighter .
 Oh , wow .
 Yeah , I know , it really took a bite out of my video game time . What are you and Penny doing ?
 Oh , I 'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner .
 Oh , that 's not bad , but as far as romance goes ,
 I think my gift hits it right out of ...
 Want to come to dinner with us ? Yes , please .

 Okay .
 Amy will be here shortly , expecting the perfect Valentine 's gift , so ... you 're up kid .
 Dazzle me .
 Go . Okay , I think I have some really great choices .
 I went on Amy 's Facebook page and read up on her interests .
 Now , see , I never would have thought to do that .
 Clearly , I made a good choice farming this out to you . But I am telling you , Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot .
 Anyway , my socks are on .
 Let 's knock them off .

 Well , um , I know she loves playing the harp , so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favorite songs .

 Now , Amy already has a real harp .
 And it can play any song . What are you trying to pull here ?
 No , I just thought it would be ...
 Next .
 Okay .
 Um , I know she 's a fan of
 Mmm . so I found ... this cool map that illustrates the character 's journey through England .

 I thought we could put it in a really nice frame .
 But she 's got Google Maps on her phone .
 I don 't know how to respond to that .
 Well , I hope it 's with a third good option , because these first two ... blah .
 Okay . Well , uh , luckily , I saved the best for last .
 Since Amy 's a neuroscientist ,
 I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramón y Cajal , the father of modern neuroscience , did lots of hand drawings of brain cells .
 And I managed to find this signed print .
 Wow .
 Oh , this is truly remarkable .
 Thank you .
 I think I 'll keep it for myself .

 What about your girlfriend ?
 It 's too late . I call dibs .

 This place is really beautiful . Wah ... romance ninja .
 ( laughing )
 Hey .
 Sorry we 're late .
 No problem . We just sat down .
 Mmm , would you like some wine ?
 Yeah , fill her up .

 I 'll tell you when to stop . Is everything okay ?
 Terrific . Couldn 't be better .
 Oh , bite me .

 Look , we can still have a nice night .
 Just tell me where it is .
 Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do , I 'd tell you .
 Uh , where what is ?
 She hid my Xbox like I 'm a child .
 Yeah , and my mom got me that for my birthday , so if you don 't give it back , I 'm telling .
 I 've been working late every night .
 All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry .
 But did he do it ? No .
 He just kept on playing that stupid game .
 You like pushing buttons so much , try pushing them on the washing machine .
 I said I 'm sorry .
 Sorry doesn 't clean my underpants , buddy .
 I told you , turn them inside out .
 And I told you to bite me .
 Trying to have a magical night here , guys .
 Oh , son of a bitch .
 What ? Nothing .
 Nothing .
 No , tell me .
 It 's just this guy I used to date .
 LEONARD :
 Oh .
 Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen , who 's here with him now . You 're kidding .
 And it looks like she lost a lot of weight , damn it .

 I know it 's not ideal , but don 't let them ruin our night . No , you 're totally right .
 She could be skinny ' cause she 's dying . That 's the spirit .
 You know what , screw them .
 Our night is going to be way more special than theirs . Yeah .
 Uh- oh .
 What ?
 Oh , you got to be kidding me .
 Oh , my God , yes . Of course I 'll marry you .
 ( applause )
 Two can play this game .
 Penny ...
 Get up . All right .


 It 's nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine 's Day can come here tonight and be together . Yeah , I 'm really looking forward to it .
 In fact , there 's no place I would rather be than here .
 Except on a date with anybody .
 Literally anybody .
 You know , you and I have so much fun hanging out .
 If you were a girl , all our problems would be solved .

 What ?
 Oh , yeah , think about it .
 We 'd hang out , we 'd read comic books , we 'd see movies .
 It 'd be like the best relationship ever .
 That does sound nice .
 Then I 'd take you home , slip off your little black dress and just pile- drive you into oblivion .
 What ?
 PENNY :
 Oh , I can 't believe he 's going to marry the girl he cheated on me with .
 Isn 't it kind of nice ? I mean , he was with the wrong person , and now he found the right person .
 What , so I 'm the person ?
 Maybe you want to be with Gretchen , too .
 They do look happy .
 Yeah , maybe tonight .
 But a year from now , he 'll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox .
 Well , he will . You know what ?
 Why don 't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine 's Day ?
 Yes , absolutely . ( clears throat )

 ( Penny scoffs )
 Now they 're doing that phony
 link- arm- drink thingy .
 I totally taught him that . I thought we were letting it go .
 We were ; it 's just ... it 's not fair , okay ?
 They 're bad people .
 It 's not supposed to end happy for them ; it 's supposed to end happy for me .
 Um ... it did end happy for you .
 You 're here with me .
 Yeah , yeah , I know .
 Okay , this is getting a little hard to not take personally .
 Oh , come on , don 't make this about you . Oh , I 'm not .
 It 's about you . Yeah , well , whatever , okay ?
 I told you , Valentine 's Day sucks .
 This one does , and you 're the reason why .
 What ?
 You know , compared to them ,
 I 'm feeling pretty good about us . Me , too .
 How about we blow off dessert , go home early ...
 I 'll do that laundry .
 Thank you . I love you . Love you , too .
 So where 'd you hide it ?
 Where you 'd never look .
 Damn it , it 's in the washing machine .


 Hello .
 Hello .
 Happy Valentine 's Day .
 Okay .

 Shall we go to dinner ? Hang on .
 As you know , I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts .
 Yes , and as you know , I planned to pretend to enjoy it .
 I 've been working on this facial expression all day .
 And I appreciate your effort , but upon contemplation ,
 I decided I was being selfish .
 So , I canceled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine 's Day .
 What is that ?
 By doing none of it -- no dinner , no romance , no gifts .
 We stay here , order a pizza and watch one of your beloved
 Star War Trek things . Really ? Well , that 's what you 'd love , isn 't it ?
 More than anything .
 Well , then ... that 's what we 're going to do .
 Well ... I don 't know what to say .
 This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone 's ever given me .
 And that 's including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today .
 I 'm your girlfriend . That 's my job .
 And I know gift- giving puts a lot of pressure on you , so whatever you got me , you can return .
 No .
 No , after everything you didn 't do for me tonight ,
 I want you to have it .
 What 's this ? Read it .
 " Sheldon Cooper ,
 Caltech University employee information " ?
 At the bottom . " In case of emergency , please contact ...
 Amy Farrah Fowler . "
 And there 's my phone number .
 This is the most beautiful gift you could 've ever given me .
 Well , I thought , if I have a stroke or a kidney stone , who would I want to share that with ?
 And you picked me .
 It 's like you said -- you 're my girlfriend . Oh , Sheldon .
 Yeah ...


 Okay .
 Stop ruining Valentine 's Day and order my pizza .

 Night .
 Yep .

 ( sighs ) ( door shuts )
 You know what ?
 That was pretty crappy of you .
 I mean , all I wanted to do was give you a great night , and it 's like you- you went out of your way to destroy it .
 Yeah , I know . I 'm a total bitch .
 I 'm not saying that . Well , I am .
 Fine , you win .
 You 're a bitch .
 Why couldn 't we just have a nice time ?
 I don 't know .
 ( sighs )
 Maybe 'cause things are going so well between us lately and I 've been really happy .

 Okay , you 're gonna have to make a lot more sense than that .
 Obviously , I have some commitment issues .
 Glaringly obvious . Go on .
 As long as things keep going great between us , you 'll keep asking me to marry you , and eventually I 'm gonna end up saying yes , and then we 're gonna be married forever , and the whole thing just freaks me out .
 ( sighs ) Okay .
 I know I propose a lot .

 So how about this ?
 I promise I will never ask you to marry me again .
 What ... what do you mean ? Are you breaking up with me ? No .
 No , no , no , no .
 But if someday you decide you want to get married , you have to propose to me .
 Really ? Yes .
 It 's all on you .
 But I got to tell you , when the time comes , I want the whole nine yards . I want you down on one knee , flowers .
 I want to be swept off my feet .
 Yeah , you got it .
 And I 'm cool with surprises .
 But nothing on a Jumbotron .
 I don 't want to cry on a big screen like that .

 Okay .
 You know what ?
 This might be the wine talking , but I have a very important question to ask you .
 You do ? Leonard Hofstadter ...
 Yes ?
 ... will you be my valentine ?
 Sorry . Maybe next year .
 I 'm just kidding !
 Romance ninja .
 Let 's have sex !
 Wah !

 ( music playing )
 Thank you , guys , for doing this .
 We 're glad you could make it .
 Usually I spend Valentine 's Day sad and alone .
 This year , I 'm just sad .

 What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy ?
 I know .
 I hate myself most of the time , but tonight 's the night I know everyone else does , too .
 I think you 're cool . Great .

 I got to tell you , we 've got to stop beating ourselves up like this .
 Excuse me , everybody . Can I have your attention , please ?
 ( music stops playing )

 We 're all here tonight because ... we have no one to be with .
 But ... that doesn 't make us mutants .
 The only mutants here are in these comic books .
 We 've got to stop defining our self- worth by whether or not we 're in a relationship .
 You know what I see when I look around ?
 I see a room full of great people .
 So let 's give ourselves a break .
 We are a community , and as long as we have each other , we 're never truly alone .
 ( sighs )
 That was cool .
 What you said .
 You really think so ?
 Yeah , I do . Thank you .

 Uh ...
 Would you like to , uh ... get a cup ... a cup of coffee or ... ?
 Okay .


 Later , losers !

 ( phone rings )
 Hello ?
 Another medical emergency ?
 What 's wrong with him now ?
 I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider .
 How exactly does a bump feel Asian ?
 Just put him on the phone .

 Sheldon , I am not driving over there again .
 Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumor that turned out to be an ice cream headache .
 Yes , I still want to be your emergency contact .
 Yes , you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumor .
 I 'm on my way .
 Brain tumor would explain a lot .
