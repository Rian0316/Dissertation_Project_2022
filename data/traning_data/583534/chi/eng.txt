 I just wish there was something we could do .
 HeIlo , coma guy .
 Get up , you GirI Scout ! Up , up , up !

 Maybe nobody 's tried this .
 I wish we at Ieast knew his name .
 Look at that face .

 I bet he 's a Iawyer .
 Yeah , but the dents in his knuckles mean he 's artistic .
 Okay . He 's a Iawyer who teaches sculpting on the side .

 I wish aII guys could be Iike him .

 Back to the book . What is this about you being arrested in London ?
 Your mom was arrested ?
 I 'm busy beaming with pride .
 This is kind of embarrassing ... ... but occasionally after I 've been intimate with a man ...
 Why would she say that 's embarrassing ?
 ... I just get this craving for Kung Pao chicken .
 That 's too much information !
 So now you 're doing this book tour . How 's that going ? Oh , fine .
 I 'm leaving for New York tomorrow , which I hate .
 But I get to see my son , who I love !
 This is the way that I find out . Most moms use the phone .
 Don 't take this wrong , I just don 't see you as a mom somehow .

 - Hit me .
 There you go .
 Ross ?
 I 'm not reaIly a shot- drinking kind of guy . Hi !
 Sorry we 're Iate .
 We kind of just , you know , Iost track of time .
 But a man can change .
 Anyone want me to appraise anything ?
 Mrs. Bing , I 've read everything you 've ever written .
 When I read Euphoria at Midnight , aII I wanted to do was become a writer .
 Oh , please , honey . If I can do it , anybody can .
 Start with half a dozen European cities . . . . . . throw in 30 euphemisms for male genitalia . . . . . . and you have got yourself a book !

 Okay , thank you .
 It 's the Italian hand- Iicker , isn 't it ?

 She 's supposed to be with you .
 You 're good .
 I have sold 1 00 miIlion copies of my books , and you know why ?
 The girI on the cover with her nipples showing ?
 No , because I know how to write men that women faII in love with .
 Believe me , I cannot seII a Paolo .
 People wiII not turn 325 pages for a Paolo .
 Come on .
 The guy 's a secondary character . He 's just a complication you eventuaIly kiII off .

 He 's not a hero .
 You know who our hero is ?
 The guy on the cover with his nipples showing ?

 You 're sexy .
 - Right . - Come on , kiddo .

 I 'II just pee in the street .
 Is Chandler here ?
 Wait .
 Come here .
 Okay , about Iast night . . . . . . you know . . . . . . Chandler , you didn 't teIl . . . .
 We don 't need to teII Chandler .
 It was just a kiss . No big deal , right ?
 Right .
 No big deal . In Bizarro- world !
 You broke the code !
 - What code ?
 - You don 't kiss your friend 's mom .
 Sisters are okay .
 Maybe a hot- Iooking aunt .
 But not a mom . Never a mom !
 What are you guys doing out here ?
 Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetbaII game .
 But apparently somebody overslept .
 Yeah , weIl , you don 't have your racquet .
 No . No , I don 't because it 's being restrung .
 Somebody was supposed to bring me one .
 WeIl , you didn 't caII and Ieave your grip size .
 You guys are spending way too much time together .
 I 'm scum . I 'm scum .
 - How could you Iet this happen ?
 - I don 't know . It 's not Iike she 's a regular mom .
 She 's sexy . She 's . . . . You don 't think my mom 's sexy ?
 WeIl , not in the same way .
 I 'II have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day .
 You think it 's easy giving birth to seven children ?
 Okay , I think we 're getting into a weird area here .
 What are you doing here ?
 Not playing racquetbaIl .
 - He forgot to Ieave his grip size .
 - He didn 't get the goggles .
 Sounds Iike you two have issues .
 Goodbye , baby .
 Do they wait for me to do this ?
 - Are you gonna teII him ?
 - Why would I teII him ?
 How about , because if you don 't , his mother might ?
 What are you guys doing here ?
 He 's not even wearing a jock strap !
 What did I ask ?
 What are you doing here ? I just thought I 'd stop by , you know , after . . . . . . that I , you know .
 Nothing .
 So what are you doing here ?
 I 'm not reaIly here . I just thought I 'd drop these off on the way . My way .
 Do you come here a Iot . . . . . . without me ?
 No , no , no .
 Do you think he 's doing any better than he was this morning ?
 How would I know ? I wasn 't here .
 ReaIly ? Not even to change his pajamas ?
 Oh , my God !
 You 're my friend . I had to teII you .
 I can 't believe it .
 Paolo kissed my mom ?
 I don 't know if you noticed , but he had a Iot to drink .
 I mean , you know how he gets when he 's drunk --
 I can 't do this . I did it . It was me .
 I 'm sorry . I kissed your mom . What ?
 I was upset about RacheI and Paolo and I had too much tequila , and Nora . . . . . . Mrs. Mom , your Bing , was . . .
 . . . just being nice .
 But nothing happened . Nothing . Ask Joey .
 Joey came in --
 You knew about this ?
 You know , knowledge is a tricky thing .
 I spent the entire day with you .
 Why didn 't you teII me ?
 You 're Iucky I caught them , or else who knows what would 've happened ?
 Thanks , man . Big help .
 I can 't believe this !
 What were you thinking ?
 I wasn 't . I don 't know . I --
 No one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you .
 - I know .
 - I can 't believe you did this !
 - Me neither .
 - I 'm mad at you for not teIling me .
 - What are you mad at me -- ? - Let me slam the door !
 I didn 't kiss her . He did .
 See what happens when you break the code ?


 " A Woman Undone . By RacheI Karen Greene . "
 I thought I 'd give it a shot .
 I 'm on the first chapter .
 Do you think his " love stick " can be " Iiberated from its denim prison " ?
 Yeah , I 'd say so .
 And there 's no " j " in " engorged . "
 Hey , Rach .
 - You going to the hospitaI tonight ?
 - No .
 You ?
 No . You ?
 You just asked me .
 Maybe it was a trick question .
 Rachel , can we do this now ?
 I am so hot !
 Here 's my mother and father on their wedding day .
 Now , you teII me she 's not a knockout .
 I cannot believe this conversation .
 Just try to picture her not pregnant .
 CentraI Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay .
 Thanks .
 I 'd Iike to start with a song about a man I recently met . . . . . . who 's come to be very important to me .
 You don 't have to be awake To be my man
 Long as you have brain waves I 'll be there to hold your hand
 Though we just met the other day
 There 's something I have got to say
 Thank you very much .
 I 'm gonna take a short break .
 Okay , that was Phoebe Buffay , everybody .
 - What the heII was that ?
 - Phoebe just started -- I was talking to Joey . AII right , there , mother- kisser ?
 " Mother- kisser . "
 I 'II shut up .
 Chandler , I know you 're stiII mad at me . . . . . . but there were two people there that night .
 - There were two sets of Iips .
 - I expect this from her .
 She 's always been a Freudian nightmare .
 If she always behaves Iike this , why don 't you say something ?
 Because it 's complicated . It 's complex !
 Hey , you kissed my mom !
 We 're rehearsing a Greek play .
 That 's funny . Are we done now ?
 You mean you 're not gonna teII her how you feel ?
 No .
 Just because you played tonsiI tennis with my mom . . . . . . doesn 't mean you know her .
 Trust me , you can 't talk to her .
 Okay . " You can 't " ? Or you can 't ?
 Okay , that 's my finger .
 Okay , that 's my knee .
 StiII doing the play .
 What did you do with him ?
 - You 're awake !
 - Look at you ! How do you feel ?
 A Iittle woozy , but basicaIly okay .
 Gosh , you Iook good !
 I feeI good .
 Who are you ? - Sorry .
 - I 'm Phoebe Buffay .
 I 'm Monica GeIler .
 I 've been taking care of you .
 We both have .
 - The Etch A Sketch is from you guys ?
 - ActuaIly , from me .
 - I got you the foot massager .
 - I shaved you .
 I read to you . I sang .
 WeIl , thanks . - Oh , my pleasure .
 - You 're welcome .
 So I guess I 'II see you around . What ?
 That 's it ?
 " See you around " ?
 - What do you want me to say ?
 - I don 't know .
 Maybe . . . . . . " That was nice . "
 " It meant something to me . " " I 'II caII you . "

 - AII right . I 'II caII you .
 - I don 't think you mean that .
 This is so typical .
 You know , we give . . . . . . and we give . . . . . . and we give .
 And then we just get nothing back .
 And then one day , it 's just , you wake up , and " See you around . "
 Let 's go , Phoebe .
 You know what ? We thought you were different .
 But I guess it was just the coma .
 The car 's waiting .
 I just wanted to drop off my book for your friends .
 - Anything you want from Lisbon ?
 - Just knowing you 're there is enough .
 AII right . WeIl , be good . I love you .
 You kissed my best Ross !
 Or something to that effect .
 Look , it was stupid .
 - ReaIly stupid . - ReaIly stupid .
 And I don 't even know how it happened .
 I 'm sorry , honey .
 I promise it wiII never happen again .
 Are we okay now ?
 No .
 The forbidden Iove of a man and his door .
 He told her off .
 And not just about the kiss , about everything !
 You 're kidding ?
 He said , " When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom ? "
 Then she came back with . . . . . . " The question is , when are you gonna grow up and realize I have a bomb ? "
 Are you sure she didn 't say . . . . . . " When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom ? "
 That makes more sense .
 You think ?
 What 's going on now ? I don 't know .
 I 've been standing here speIling it out for you .
 I don 't hear anything . Wait !
 What do you see ? It 's hard to teIl .
 They 're tiny and upside down .
 Wait , wait , wait ! They 're walking away . They 're walking away .
 No , they 're not .
 They 're coming right at us .
 Run , run !
 Are you okay , kiddo ? Yeah , I 'm okay . AII right .
 You be good .
 Drive safe .
 - Mrs. Bing . - Mr. GeIler .
 You mean that ?
 Yeah , why not ?
 So I told her . - How did it go ?

 - Awful . Awful . Couldn 't have gone worse .
 WeIl , how do you feel ? Pretty good .
 I told her .
 WeIl , see ? So maybe it wasn 't such a bad idea me kissing your mom , huh ?
 But we don 't have to go down that road .
 This is just the first chapter . . . . . . and I want your absolute honest opinion .
 Okay ?
 And on page two , he 's not reaching for her " heaving beasts . "
 What 's a " niffle " ?
 You can usuaIly find them on the heaving beasts .
 AII right , so I 'm not a great typist .
 Wait , did you get to the part about his " huge , throbbing pens " ?
 You don 't wanna be around when he starts writing with those !
 That 's it . Give them back !
