 do you think you can forgive me ?

 - I 'm sorry , mike .
 - Oh , you 're sleepwalking . I 'm sorry i ran you over , mike .
 i 'm sorry for what i 'm putting you through .
 If it for anyone but you , it wouldn 't be worth it .
 it 's rick 's place -- Totally went up in flames .




 Did i eat ... your ice cream ?
 Is that what you 're asking ?
 oh , i think it looks ... spiffy .
 I guess she 's pretty .
 I mean ... i didn 't really notice .



 Whatcha doing ? I am onesing for a cup of coffee ,
 But the stupid burner is acting up again .
 Need a little caffeine fix ?
 Big- Time .
 Too much booze last night . I 'm really draggin ' .
 The open bar is no longer your friend , huh ?
 Guess not .
 And i couldn 't resist . Is that where you were during bree 's acceptance speech --
 Doing free shots at the bar ? No . Uh ,
 I think that 's when i snuck out to the car to listen to the game .
 - You go alone ? - Well ,
 I would 've invited carlos , except ... obviously , he can 't really sneak around anymore , so ... yeah .
 I was thinkin ' ,
 If anyone asks about that fire at rick 's ,
 It 'd be good if you had someone to account for where you were .
 Why would it matter ? I didn 't start the fire .
 Right , right .
 It 'd be handy if y could prove them wrong , wouldn 't it ?
 You think i did it .

 One stupid brick , and now i 'm an arsonist ? No , no . Of course not .
 It 's just , If the police came here to ask us about the brick ,

 So you might wanna be ready . Listen to me , lynette .
 As mad as i have been at rick , I had absolutely nothing to do with this fire .
 We 're fine .
 Okay . - Good . - Uh- Huh .


 Desperate housewives 413 <Font color= " # ffff00" >capture : xxy





 Cense and registration , please .
 Well , what did i do ? I wasn 't speeding . There 's a construction zone back there .
 You failed to slow down . Are you sure ?
 I didn 't see a sign or anything . You wanna step out of the car , please ?
 You 're not gonna give me a ticket , are you ?
 My mom will kill me .
 Where do you go to school ? Fairview high .
 Pretty necklace .
 Oh , thanks .
 Listen , i 'm really sorry about the construction zone .
 I would have slowed down if i had seen the sign , i swear .
 I 'll tell you what .
 I 'll let you go with a warning .
 Just pay more attention next time , okay ?
 Thank you .
 That 's very nice of you .
 Thank you .

 That 's everything , i guess .
 Well , if you forgot something , you can just come back for it ,
 Or ... you could just not leave .
 Oh , that 's so sweet , but ... our house is livable again --
 The downstairs anyway -- And we have imposed long enough .
 Besides , mike is comingome tonight , And you 're gonna need the house to yourselves .
 Well , before you go , i just want to say that , um ... having you here these last few weeks --
 Susan , i 'm just going across the street . There 's no need to act like a silent movie heroine .
 I know .
 I just ... i can 't stop now . I broke the seal .
 Well , um , as much as i appreciate
 This naked display of emotion , You know how this sort of thing makes me uncomfortable .
 I can 't help it .
 My hormones are in overdrive .
 Didn 't you get that way when you were pregnant ? No .
 Never . Really ?
 Not even when you heard an acoustic guitar ?
 No . Never .
 Oh , i just can 't control myself like that .
 Oh , sure , you can . Whenever i feel my emotions getting the best of me ,
 I simply picture an empty box ,
 And then i picture myself putting the box away
 In a big , empty closet and closing the door .
 Then if i have time , i go back
 And open the box and
 Deal with the emotion ... in private , like a lady .
 Thanks .
 I 'm gonna try that .
 So you don 't think i act like a lady ?
 Prove me wrong , sweetie . Prove me wrong .
 All right .
 Come on , girl .
 Okay , carlos , here 's the harness .
 There you are !
 Oh , you must be roxy !
 Aren 't you the cutest thing ! Oh !
 Okay , not too close . It 's silk .
 Gaby , this is steve . He 's the head trainer at the dog school .
 Ah , nice to meet you .
 How much he enjoyed taking classes with roxy .
 Well , they make a great team .
 Well , i have got a million questions about this little lifesaver here .
 Okay , shoot . Okay , hypothetical situation --
 Carlos and i are sitting on the couch . I 'm doing my nails .
 He 's whining for the remote . How do i get roxy to fetch it for him ?
 She 's serious .
 Oh . Roxy doesn 't do that .
 Um , her job is to get carlos from point " a " to point " b "
 As safely as possible . I get that , but surely she 's trained to do other stuff ,
 You know , like find his keys or turn off the radio
 Or lick up his spills .
 Yeah , and after that , she can go solve crimes with shaggy and the gang .
 Don 't ve me i saw a collie on tv who could push a lawn mower .
 Do you have one of those ? Gaby , roxy 's fantastic .
 Really ? Well , for a dog who 's supposed to help us ,
 She sounds kind of limited .
 Sorry , but it 's true .

 Which you would know if you had bothered to show up to the spouses ' orientation . Well , i 'm sorry .
 I was on my hands and knees that day ,
 Scouring the bathroom floor Because you fused to pee like a girl .
 So ... any other questions ?
 No , it 's crystal clear .
 Carlos gets a new best friend ,
 And i get to check the sofa for ticks .
 Yay for gaby !
 Did i exaggerate ?
 Actually , you were kin
 Oh , it feels good to take a shower in my own house .
 At you doing ?
 In honor of you coming home , we are making your favorite meal -- Steak and mashed potatoes . Oh , that sounds great .
 For future reference ,
 My favorite is potatoes au gratin .
 Mmm . Since when ?
 Since always . Since i was 3 . Hmm .
 You could say " au gratin " when you were 3 ?
 Oh , it 's fine . Susan , mashed is great , too .

 It 's not your favorite ? What are you doing ?
 Excuse me .
 I have to put something in a box and stick it in the closet .

 Hormones .
 Oh . Got it . Pretty much anything sets her off these days .
 Uh , which is why
 I haven 't told her ... told her what ?
 Something wrong ?
 Well , when bree and orson were staying with us ,
 This weird thing happened .
 Oh , yeah . Naked orson ?
 I heard .
 Must have been quite a show . No , this was the next night .
 He was sleepwalking , and he said something kinda strange .
 But like i said , he was asleep , so it 's probably nothing .
 Julie , what 'd he say ? He said ...
 " i 'm sorry i ran over mike . "

 - What ? - It 's crazy , right ? Why would he say something like that ?
 He didn 't even know you when that happened .
 Yeah , you 're right . It 's crazy . Yeah , that 's what i figured .
 Okay , well , i 'm gonna go check on mom and make sure she 's okay .
 We don 't need any more drama in this house .
 Yeah , i agree .

 How 's the move going ?
 Need an extra pair of hands ?
 No , thanks .
 We 're almost done . Okay , well , i won 't get in your way then .
 Let me just run something by you .
 I got a call today from a couple
 Who loved our work on the founder 's ball .
 - Oh , how sweet . - Yes ,
 And they want to hire us to do their anniversary party .
 Hire us ? But we 're not a business .
 We could be . Think about it .
 We do the exact same thing we did at the ball , Only this time , we walk away with a big , fat check .
 Katherine , need i remind you we nearly came to blows over floral choices ?
 I think it 's ourcreative friction that makes us a great team .
 I think it 's our creative friction that nearly caused me to poison you .
 All right , look , bree , ??
 With adam out of the house , i really need the money . I sympathize .
 I do , but i have a new baby ,
 And it 's really more work than i care to take on right now . I understand .
 Guess i 'll just do it myself then .
 Excuse me ?
 Now did you take pictures of those table settings you designed ?
 Yeah , sure .
 You know , i don 't really think it 's fair
 That you should profit from something that i designed . You 're right .
 It would only be fair if i asked you to do this with me , Which i did , and you said no .
 So on we go . I hope you don 't mind if i serve your cinnamon apple crumble .
 That is a cherished recipe from my grandmother .
 Well , w it 's a cherished recipe from catering by katherine .
 Oh , i see what 's going on here .
 This is shameless emotional blackmail .
 And ?
 And ... it worked beautifully .
 I 'm in .


 No more doggy treats .
 She 's had enough .
 But she 's been so good . Yeah ?
 Well , when she learns how to make granite sparkle ,
 She can have more .
 I 'm giving her a treat . Carlos , i said no .


 That 's it . Those things are expensive ,
 And until your disability kicks in , we have to tighten our belts .
 So i guess that means you won 't be getting your hair done anymore .
 Carlos , remember what my fingers look like ?
 Just picture the middle one all by itself .
 Besides , you 're the one who married me for my looks .
 Well , i 'm blind now ,
 So as long as you use deodorant , i 'm good .
 Do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now ?
 Just because you 're blind , the world should suffer ? I 'm just saying , you know , $300 visits to mr . Francois --
 Carlos , i 'm getting my hair done ! End of discussion !
 What are you barking at ?
 You got your damn treat .
 You know , if we really want to save money ,
 You could cut down on those cuban cigars . Or ... here 's a thought .
 You could get a job . Why don 't you get a job ?
 Doing what ?
 Put flags on pencils and sell them at the airport .


 What is this about ? I don 't know . I guess she doesn 't like it when you smack me .
 Oh , so now i can 't hit my own husband in my own house ?
 Look , we can cut corners ??
 But i am not gonna skimp when it comes to my dog .
 Roxy , come .


 Hey , neighbor .
 Oh , mike .
 Hey . Welcome back . You 're looking well .
 Yeah , well , you know me . Indestructible .
 Yeah . What you looking for ?
 A hammer .
 We 're putting some of the pictures back up . This it ?
 Thanks , buddy .
 You got a minute ?
 Uh , actually , uh , bree 's waiting --
 Waiting for me . You said something to julie when you were sleepwalking .
 I did ? Yeah , and i need you to clear it up .

 Are you the guy that ran me over ?
 Mike ...

 i 'm so sorry .
 I 'm so ...




 no way .
 That mutt is not sleeping in our bed !
 She 's clean . It 's okay . No .
 No , it 's not .
 I read the pamphlet steve left . These dogs are not allowed on furniture . I know .
 I ... i just think it 's good for a dog to sleep with its master .
 It helps us bond .
 Well , if you ever want to bond with my boobs again , You 'll get her off ! You 're being selfish .
 We can put her at the foot of the bed .
 Carlos , no !
 She doesn 't like it when you yell at me , remember ?

 You 're right , baby . I 'm sorry . Let me try it this way .
 You listen to me , you blind son of a bitch .
 If you don 't get this mangy , 6- Nippled , cujo wannabe off my satin sheets ,
 You n 't just need a dog to get around .
 You 'll need a motorized wheelchair that you steer with your tongue .
 Really ?
 Carlos , i mean it .
 Who 's it gonna be -- Me or the dog ?



 Maternity lingerie -- Yeah , right . Why don 't they just call it what it really is ?
 A pup tent to hide your stretch marks .
 Oh , actually , if it 's okay ,
 I 'm really not in the mood right now . I 'm sorry .
 I understand .
 Thanks . You just don 't want to be crushed under the weight of a repulsive cow .
 - That is not it . - No , i get it .
 Really , i knew this day was coming .
 I just didn 't know it would be a day when i was so horny .
 Honey , i still find you incredibly sexy .
 It 's me . I. .. I just got a lot on my mind right now .
 Oh .
 What 's going on ?
 I found out something today .
 I didn 't want to tell you , but ... well , you can tell me anything .
 That 's what we talked about in all those sessions with the doctor .
 You 're right .
 But if i tell you ,
 You have to promise to let me handle this my own way .

 Who could that be at this hour ?

 Susan .
 What on earth ?

 - Do you understand ?
 - What are you talking about ?
 Do you hear me , orson ? ! Damn it .
 Susan , i -- I told you to let me handle this . Will someone please tell me ??
 So you don 't know that your husband tried to kill mike ?
 What ? Look , i explained this to mike .
 I panicked . I was trying --
 Trying to protect your mother ?
 I know . Who cares ?

 Susan , let 's go .
 And the worst part ... all this time , you pretended to be our friend .






 the bitch had to go .
 Roxy ... look what i 've got .
 Come on .
 Come on .
 Yes .
 Okay , let 's go .
 Let 's go , roxy . Let 's go , roxy .
 Let 's go .

 Hey there , dylan .
 Don 't you remember me ?

 Um , yeah , i remember .
 Would it be okay if i sat down ?
 I just want to have a little chat with you . Why ?
 Don 't worry .
 You 're not in trouble .
 Actually , i can 't stay .
 I 'm meeting my friend julie at the mall , so i --
 Look , i 'm -- I 'm not trying to scare you . I just ... i just want to talk .

 Talk about what ?
 How 's your mom doing ?
 You know my mom ? Oh , yeah .

 Look , a couple of days ago ,
 I saw a picture of you and kathy in the paper , And i did a background check ,
 And i found out that you 're living back at your aunt 's place .

 When you left yesterday , i was parked down the street .
 You followed me ?
 So when you pulled me over , - That was -- - I lied to you .
 You weren 't speeding . I 'm sorry .

 I just had to meet you .

 I 'm wayne davis .
 I 'm your father .


 Roxy , this way . Um , excuse me for a second . Uh , mrs .
 Solis , what are you doing here ?
 Hi .
 Uh , i 'm bringing roxy back .
 Uh , what ?
 Shame , isn 't it ?
 But she and carlos just did not get along .
 Really ?
 Well , sorry it didn 't work out . I gotta run .
 Tell carlos i 'll call him about another dog .
 Oh , well , actually , we found one .
 From where ? We 're the only guide dog school in the area .
 Well , that 's it . It 's not a dog .
 We got him a seeing ... eye ... monkey . He 's amazing .
 Not only can he call 9- 1- 1 , he can toast a bagel .
 Bye .


 Roxy , what the heck happened back there ?
 Roxy !
 Roxy ! Roxy , stop !
 Gaby , where were you ? Where 's roxy ?
 Oh , carlos , i 'm afraid i have some bad news .
 What ? At happened ?
 Well , you know how you like it when i read you the box scores ?
 When i went out to get the paper --
 Ly thinking of making you happy --
 Gaby , where 's my dog ?
 She ran away .
 When i opened the door , she saw a squirrel , and she took off . She 's gone ?
 Well , you gotta go find her .
 Where do you think i 've been ?
 There 's no sign of her anywhere . Yeah , i 'm sure you looked really , really hard .
 How dare you .
 I have looked from one end of town to the other ,
 And i 'm telling you , she 's nowhere to be found .

 But since you love her so much , i 'm gonna keep looking .
 Was that roxy ? I 'm not sure .
 Why don 't i go look ?
 No . It 's the scavo dog ... Oh , wow .
 I guess it 's true --
 Lose one sense , all the others get heightened .
 Okay , you get that .
 I 'm gonna go find your dog .
 Come on , you stupid mutt .
 Gaby , you still here ? Yeah , still no sign of roxy .
 But don 't worry .
 I 'm on the case .
 Hey . That was steve from the guide dog place .
 You want a piece of pie or somethin ' ?
 Yeah , i 'm not ngry either .


 I don 't know what to say to you . You don 't have to say anything .
 I 'm having a good time just looking at you .

 You have my nose .

 Bet you didn 't know that , right ? My mom says we left because you used to beat her .

 Is that true ?
 Yeah , i hit her a couple times . So you admit it ?
 What , did you think i was gonna lie and tell you that i was a great husband ?
 ' Cause i wasn 't .
 But you gotta know , there 's two sides to every story , And i swear to god , your mom gave as good as she got .



 I mean , you believe me , right ?
 I don 't know .

 You know what ?
 This was a mistake . I should go .
 Go ?
 We just got here . Look , i didn 't track you down to cause any problem I only wanted to make sure that your mom raised you properly ,
 And now i see that she did .
 I mean , you 're ... you 're spectacular .
 That 's what i needed ... to know that you 're okay and ... that a little part of you looks just like me .
 How can you just walk away ?
 ' Cause i 'm not the same jerk i used to be .

 But if your mom is still scared of me after all these years , uh ... no .
 I don 't want to upset her again .

 I don 't haveo tell her .


 What ? She doesn 't have to know that i saw you .
 Oh , that 's ...
 It 's just that i have so many questions , and ... i don 't think we 'd be hurting anybody
 If we just sat and talked for a while .
 And we 'd keep this from your mom ?

 Sure .
 Well ... okay .
 Darlin ' , bring me back that dessert menu .

 I wanna have a slice of pie with my daughter .

 Uh , i think we might be out of candles .
 I don 't think so . Check under the bar .


 Rick .

 How 's it goin ' ? " How 's it goin ' " ?
 It 's goin ' pretty bad .
 I didn 't mean to . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry -- Sorry for your troubles .
 Oh , that 's touching , man .
 Thanks .
 So did you just come here to bust my hump ,
 Or is there something i can help you with ?
 Actually , you can help me .
 You can help me figure out what the hell these were doing
 By the back door of my torched restaurant .


 How should i know ?
 So that 's how you 're gonna play this ?
 No candles here .
 I 'm -- I 'm gonna go check in the back . Great .
 Look , i can see you 're upset , pal ,
 But i 'm not the guy you 're looking for .
 You know i respect you ... hey , andrew .
 What do you need ?
 Uh , i 'm looking for candles ,
 And -- And that guy rick 's here .
 Oh , my god ! Stop it ! What are you doing ?
 Stop .
 Hey , easy . Easy .
 Just stop it !
 - Are you okay ?
 - Yeah .



 Andrew , do something ! Do something !
 Stop it !
 Stop !
 Oh , for god sakes , what is the matter with you ?
 What are you , 12 years old ?
 Stop it .
 Jeez .


 So when are you guys gonna finish grilling my husband ? It won 't be much longer , ma 'am .

 You know , in spite of everything that 's happened ,
 It 's really good to see you again .

 It makes me realize how much i miss you .
 If you insist on questioning my husband about a crime he didn 't commit ,
 You should at least have all the facts .
 Okay . You 've got my attention .
 Well , for starters , Mr. Coletti opened his restaurant
 To get back at me because i wouldn 't have an affair with him .

 So you 're saying your husband had two motives for setting the fire ?
 No . I am saying that if anyone had an ax to grind , it 's rk .
 Maybe he set the fire himself soe could blame my husband .
 I was at the gym .
 You can call my trainer . And tom was at the founder 's ball with me .
 We have witnesses that say he disappeared for a while .
 I told you , i was in the car listening to the basketball game .
 That 's true .
 I saw him .
 I was mad that he ditched me ,
 So i went to drag his ass back inside .
 But when i saw him shoutingt the radio , I decided i 'll just wait

 So unless there 's a law
 Again schoosing lebron james over your wife , I think we 're done here .

 All right .

 So that 's it ? Y- You 're just gonna let him go ?
 Look , we don 't have enough evidence to hold him , sir .
 Because his wife provided him an alibi ?
 Come on , man .
 Rick , look . You know me .
 If tom had done something like this ,
 Do you really think i would protect him ?


 Fine .



 You know , you didn 't have to make up that story for me .
 Didn 't i ? ' Cause it kinda seemed
 Like they had you against the ropes in there .
 Well , that would only be a problem if i were guilty ,
 And clearly , i 'm not , right ?

 God , you don 't believe me , do you ? Sure , i do .
 It must 've been some other random maniac
 With a grudge against rick who burned down his restaurant .
 So you 're calling me a liar ? That 's what you 're doing . You 're saying i lied .
 Well , it wouldn 't be you lied about the brick ,
 Yeah , just like i bought your story about never sleeping with rick .
 Excuse me ?
 - " Oh , look at me , rick . You know me , rick . " - Okay .
 God , i felt like telling you guys to get a room .
 Okay , you are angry , so i 'm gonna let that one pass ,

 Nothing happened between me and rick .
 Okay .
 I didn 't set that fire . You see ?
 I can talk slow , too .




 Carlos asked me to pick up some doggy treats for roxy .


 Oh , i think you were busy at the time ... kidnapping his guide dog .
 Classy , by the way .
 Don 't judge me . You don 't know this hound from hell .
 Or i give carlos a little smack , and she growls .
 Well , i have an idea .

 Thanks for the biscuits , edie . No , i 'm serious .
 There was always a certain ... sick charm
 To the way you used to abuse carlos .

 We 're fine . This is who we are .
 This is our relationship . Well , ur relationship has to change , gaby ,

 Not that much . Just his eyes . Mm , no .
 I know carlos .
 He 's proud .
 He 's gonna pretend that he can still go toe- To- Toe with you
 As if he was the same man that he always was .
 But he 's not , and he will never admit that .
 Are you done with your armchair analysis , 3- Divorce annie ?
 Sure .
 But if you 're not gonna treat carlos right ,
 There are plenty of other womenout t ???
 I think i proved that .



 Why don 't you come inside ?
 I can 't come out my front door every day and see that man .
 We have to move .
 Oh .
 Susan ... i know this is difficult ,
 But before you start putting up " for sale " signs , Let 's just take a step back .
 Take a step back from what ?
 He tried to murder you .
 I know what orson did was horrible , but ... i 've decided to forgive him .
 How can you do that ? He put you in a coma .
 I sat there day after day , wondering if you were gonna live .
 As far as i 'm concerned , orson can go to hell . Well , i 've talked to him . Trust me ,
 He 's already been there . Well , that 's not enough . He should pay for what he did .
 He should go to prison . And what , leave bree without a husband
 And benjamin without a dad ? You don 't want tha
 Look ... i 've done some pretty horrible things in my life ,
 But you forgave me
 Because you knew how much i regretted 'em . I really believe he 's sorry for what he did .

 I 've just got to .
 But ... i also understand if you can 't .






 How come daddy 's sleeping on the couch again ? Come here .
 Come on . Okay .
 Mommy and daddy are sort of ... fighting ,
 But we 're working through it . What are you fighting about ?
 Oh , something he did that made mommy really mad .


 Can we talk to you about something ? Yes , of course .
 The other day at the pizza place ... mm- Hmm ?
 We heard daddy say that man wanted to take you away from us .
 Oh , sweetie , i am so sorry .
 I bet that really scared you , didn 't it ? Yeah .
 So when you went to that party ,
 We got on our bikes and de down to his restaurant .
 You did what ?
 We just wanted him to go away .


 Oh , my god .



 Mike says i need to forgive orson ... susan -- And he 's right .
 I have to find a way to make peace with all of this . But you need to understand ,
 It 's gonna be one of the hardest things i 've ever done .
 And like most things in my life ,
 I probably won 't do it with much elegance or grace .
 So if i don 't come over to your house for coffee ... if i don 't smile when the two of you walk by ,
 Just please know that i still love you .
 And for forgiving orson ... just be patient .
 I 'll get there .
 I think it 's admirable that you wanna forgive orson ... because i can 't .






 Whatcha doin ' ?
 Working on the menu for the event that bree and i are catering .
 I have to stop now to ... pick up the invitations at the printer 's beforehey close .
 I can do that for you . - It 's okay , sweetie . - No , i want to .
 Maybe i could pick up some dinner for us on the way back .
 You know , mrs .
 Hoskins ' daughter became nice like this once ... right before she brought home a boy named slash .
 I 'm being nice because i 've been a pain lately , and ... with adam gone , we need to be a team . It 's just us now .
 What ?
 It 's just ... it 's like you turned into this lovely young woman
 When i wasn 't looking .
 Hey .
 We have to stop at the printer on the way to dinner . Whatever you say , sweetheart .





 well , what you 've you been doing ? ... some things disappear .
 Like , that happened to me like ...
