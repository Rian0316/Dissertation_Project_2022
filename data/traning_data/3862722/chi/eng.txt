 00 : 00 : 01, 649 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 088 Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine .
 And that , little lady , is pi to a thousand places .
 I 'd say I 'm sorry I asked , except I didn 't .
 Oh , look , it 's the that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote .
 Oh , let me see .
 I have mixed feelings about doing interviews .
 I like the part where I talk .
 I do not like the part where the other man talks .
 Sheldon , this article doesn 't mention Leonard at all .
 Well , that can 't be right .
 It only refers to " Dr. Cooper and his team . "
 Did you even talk about him ?
 All I did was answer a few questions about the theory .
 And then expressed my gratitude that doesn 't include any of those smelly perfume cards .
 Poor Leonard .
 Why ?
 The theory he came up with just got mentioned in
 He ought to be thrilled .
 He might not be .
 Oh , maybe you 're right .
 He is kind of a lump .
 Think about it .
 How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard 's team ?
 Oh , I 'd be incensed .
 So you see what I 'm getting at ?
 Squeaky wheel gets the grease ?
 No .
 Grass is always greener ?
 Try again .
 Well , I don 't know -- we 're all Groot ?
 Just tell me .
 Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are , and he was overlooked .
 He 's going to feel bad .
 But it wasn 't my fault .
 I didn 't exclude him .
 And I didn 't write the article .
 Remember that time you didn 't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it ?
 Oh , that kid !
 Poor Leonard .
 Exactly .
 For the record , that kid was a terrible choice .

 Original Air Date on March 12 , 2015

 Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom 's stuff .
 Of course .
 I know what it 's like having to go through a loved one 's possessions .
 My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna .
 But after he died , you know what we found ?
 A statue of Shiva .
 It may not be Crips and Bloods , okay ?
 But in India , it 's a thing .
 Well , it 'll be good that you 're there .
 Howard 's been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go .
 Well , it 's hard .
 A lot of Ma 's stuff brings back fond memories .
 Is that why you couldn 't get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets ?
 Yes .
 It reminds me of us eating out and her saying ,
 " Quick , nobody 's looking , fill your pockets with ketchup "
 Leonard ?
 Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill ?
 Yeah .
 Good , good .
 And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn 't .
 And I 'm okay with that .
 Actually , your name is on the electric bill .
 Oh , right .
 This is a disaster .
 I don 't even know what you 're talking about and I agree .
 Okay , I have to tell you something , but you 're not going to like it .
 What 's going on ?
 An article was just published in about our theory .
 Did they hate it ?
 No .
 No , they loved it .
 They , uh , couldn 't say enough nice things about it .
 So what 's the problem ?
 You know how the only has my name ...
 Sheldon !
 They didn 't mention you in the article .
 Only me .
 Really ?
 I know .
 It 's not fair .
 Let the anger go , buddy .
 You just ... you relax all your muscles .
 Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter .
 Let 's keep those tight .
 Uh , that- that 's not necessary .
 It is -- they 're what hold back the urine and the feces .
 Look , maybe- maybe you shouldn 't read it .
 It 'll only make you feel worse .
 " Cooper and his team " ?
 You should know I had nothing to do with that .
 Uh ... at least they 're talking about the theory .
 I mean , that 's what 's important .
 You know , you 're right .
 You know , it 's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider- Man .
 Yeah .
 Stan Lee may get all the credit , but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important .
 Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies .
 And- and he 's far richer .
 And he 's a household name , you know ?
 Whereas , you know , you say Ditko , and that sounds like a company that makes Dits .
 That 's not helping .
 Well , I 'd give more examples , but , well , everyone in your position 's so forgettable .
 Stuart , we 're here .
 It 's nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom 's house .
 Yeah , well , I tried putting him out on the curb , but nobody took him .
 Hey .
 Just so you know , the power 's out .
 What happened ?
 I called , they said a transformer blew .
 It 's the whole block .
 Should be fixed by tomorrow .
 Wait , when did it go out ?
 In the middle of the night .
 Oh , my God .
 Howie , what 's wrong ?
 It 's all defrosting .
 It 's okay .
 It 's just food .
 It 's not just food .
 This is the last food my mother ever made .
 This is her last brisket .
 This is her last meatloaf .
 This is her last ...
 I have no idea what this is , but ... it 's the last one .
 Everything okay ?
 No .
 All Ma 's food is gonna be ruined .
 Well , why don 't we take it home and put it in our freezer ?
 You don 't want to do that .
 Refreezing not only removes moisture , but it creates ice crystals in the fibers of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture .
 What ?
 I saw a teachable moment .
 I dropped some culinary science .
 What should we do ?
 I 'll tell you exactly what we 're gonna do .
 We 're gonna eat it .
 There 's , like , 20 pounds of food in there .
 All you said was I had to get rid of things .
 You didn 't say they couldn 't pass through my colon first .
 Howie ...
 Okay .
 Then how about this ?
 Let 's invite everyone over to dinner .
 It 'll be like Ma 's feeding us one last time .
 I love that .
 Me , too .
 Oh , look , we 've got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it .
 I mean , who even reads
 It 's kind of a big deal .
 If it 's such a big deal , how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule ?
 Can we please just stop talking about it ?
 I 'm sorry .
 What can I do ?
 Nothing , I 'm fine . ( sighs )
 No , no .
 I 'm gonna cheer you up .
 ( clears throat ) Here we go .
 What are we doing ?
 I am taking you shopping .
 Oh .
 My baby is sad , and I 'm gonna make him happy again .
 Look , I know shopping cheers you up , but it 's just not really my thing .
 Well , what about this helicopter you control with an iPad ?
 Does it have a camera in it ?
 It does have a camera in it .
 Baby 's listening .
 ( knocks ) SHELDON :
 Leonard ?
 ( knocks ) Leonard ?
 ( knocks ) Leonard ?
 What ?
 I spoke to the reporter at the magazine .
 What happened ?
 Did you tell him it was my idea ?
 I did .
 Thank you .
 What did he say ?
 He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist .
 Why did he think you 're the lead scientist ?
 It was my idea !
 You know , for an extra four bucks , I can have this thing here tomorrow .
 Well , I know it was your idea , but the reporter said he 's been following my work for a while , and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is 'cause my name is on it .

 You know what ?
 I did it .
 What 's four bucks ?
 If you 're trying to make me feel better , it 's not working .
 Well ... then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill ?
 No .
 Oh .
 That 's just as well .
 They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up .
 I ...
 ( knocks ) Leonard ?
 ( knocks ) Leonard ?
 ( knocks ) Leonard ?
 Also , Wolowitz invited us all to dinner , so ...
 I 'm ready whenever you are .
 All he had was an idea .
 Well , that is an important part .
 Oh , please !
 I have ideas all day long .
 Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people .
 A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge .
 Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy .
 Why won 't Doc prescribe him something ?
 We finally find out .
 But Leonard 's idea was good .
 Fine .
 Then Grumpy -- what 's he so grumpy about ?
 Maybe his girlfriend won 't take his side .
 I 'm the one who thought of it !
 Well , didn 't he do a lot of the work ?
 But now he 's happy to let people think he 's responsible for everything .
 And that 's why you get an iPad helicopter !
 Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does ?
 It 's not your fault .
 Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically ?
 Not your fault .
 Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn 't correct him ?
 Hey , look at that pretty bird .
 He always needs all the attention .
 He 's such a baby .
 I know , I know .
 I swear , he is never ever playing with my helicopter .
 Okay , I 'll start heating some of this stuff up .
 Thanks .
 Oh , man .
 This is the boutonniere from my high school prom ... ( chuckles ) ... a piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah .
 Did she throw anything away ?
 No .
 If I find my foreskin , I 'm gonna kill myself .
 Okay , so we 've got , um , three briskets , four meatloafs , one lasagna ...
 No , that 's noodle kugel .
 One Jewish lasagna ... ... two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each , and one giant container of matzah ball soup .

 Ma always kept it on hand , in case I got sick .
 She thought she could cure anything with her cooking .
 Even the time I got food poisoning .
 From her cooking .
 You okay ?
 Yeah , I 'm okay .
 Let 's get started .
 You got it .
 ( voice breaking ) : I 'm never gonna talk to her again .
 Should we tell everyone not to come ?
 No .
 I want to do this .
 Okay .
 Well , I 'll keep it together if you can .
 Okay . ( chuckles ) ( voice breaking ) :
 I 'm not making any promises !
 Glad you guys could make it .
 Of course .
 Wow , it looks really pretty in here .
 Yeah , turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood .
 So , Stuart , have you thought about what you 'd do if Howard sells the house ?
 And there goes the mood .
 Hi .
 Hello .
 Oh , and a special hello to Leonard , who needs to be mentioned by name .
 Subtle .
 But you got it , right ?
 Hey , guys .
 Hey . Hi .
 Hello .
 I just want everyone to know , uh , tonight 's not a sad occasion .
 Yeah , we just want to have the kind of dinner that we 've all had here so many times before .
 Good food , good friends , and sometime around midnight , heartburn that makes you pray for death .
 Do you need any help in the kitchen ?
 No , we got it .
 You guys make yourselves comfortable .
 All right , hey , you two , we 're here for Howard right now , okay ?
 Yes , so please behave yourselves .
 Fine .
 Of course .
 So I heard you two , uh , wrote a paper together .
 How 's that going ?
 This food is amazing .
 Mm , and not a vegetable in sight .
 That 's not true .
 We 've got tomatoes right here .
 All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight .
 Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon .
 Indeed .
 Penny , a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day .
 Oh , so it 's like
 Sheldon , is a daytime talk show hosted by women .
 Oh , I 'm aware .
 It features Whoopi Goldberg .
 She played Guinan on

 Penny , refers to
 Shut up .
 I would like to propose a salon topic .
 Ooh , please do , Rajesh .
 The lead in is a woman .
 Marvel has made " Tor " a female .
 Wait , who 's Tor ?
 You know , Tor , the God of " Tunder . "
 As I was saying , is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality ?
 Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now .
 It 's true .
 At the store , I had to put a seat on the toilet .
 We won 't know if there 's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work .
 I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor .
 PENNY : Okay , new salon topic .
 Salons -- dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes ?
 Discuss .
 I don 't believe it matters what the topic is .
 What 's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way .
 It 's all about the execution .
 Of course you 'd focus on that rather than the inspiration .
 Uh , new salon topic .
 What 's more important , an idea or its execution ?
 Oh , that 's fun .
 Yeah , good for you , Leonard .
 That 's a lovely little notion .
 Kind of like ,
 " I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago . "
 Yeah , now stand back while I invent the telephone .
 " Hello ?
 Oh , hold on . "
 Leonard , it 's your uncle .
 He says you just got burned .
 Sheldon .
 You guys .
 No , it 's okay .
 We 're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion .
 At least I am .
 Howard , what do you think ?
 Well , I guess , as an engineer , I lean towards execution .
 I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real .
 Well said , old chap .
 I thought eloquence had died ; here it stands before us .
 Starting today , it 'll go :
 Gettysburg Address ,
 " I have a dream " and what you just said .
 Oh , now he 's a genius ?
 All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering .
 Leonard , please .
 His mother just died .
 You 're being ridiculous .
 Yeah , so are you .
 Guys , if I wanted to hear people be bitchy ,
 I 'd go to my real salon .
 Leonard , lots of people could 've had that idea , but very few people could 've worked out the math the way I did .
 Lots of people also didn 't have that idea ,
 like everyone in the entire world except for me .
 Oh , well , apparently Leonard thinks he 's better than everyone in the whole world , including those fighting for our freedom .

 Yeah , well , I don 't know about you , but I support our boys overseas .
 And girls .
 Hey , you already ruined Thor ; give it a rest .
 So I 'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit ? !
 I didn 't hog anything .
 Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it .
 You want some of this ?
 I 'll give you some .
 BERNADETTE :
 Hey !
 Sheldon , Leonard , living room , right now !
 She said my name first ; that must kill you .
 BERNADETTE :
 I don 't know what you think you 're doing , but this is a very difficult time for my husband !
 We 're eating the last food his mother ever made , and you were gonna throw it at each other like children ? !
 Whatever it is you 're fighting about , put it aside , go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there 's no dessert for either of you !
 Look at me when I 'm talking to you !
 And don 't think ...
 You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom ?
 I don 't hear it .
 No , not at all .
 ( all groaning quietly )
 I don 't think I 've eaten that much in my entire life .
 It 's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years .
 Took that long to walk it off .
 You see , Penny , the Israelites were in the desert ...
 Shut up !
 So glad you two are done fighting .
 Right now , I 'm just trying to burp without throwing up .
 SHELDON :
 Hang on . mentioned the paper .
 What 'd they say ?
 Who cares ?
 Did they mention Leonard ?
 They did .
 ALL : Yay .
 Good news , I found more Tums .
 ALL :
 Yay !
