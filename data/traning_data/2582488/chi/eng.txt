 00 : 00 : 02, 661 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 074 Hey , will you steam my uniform next ? Yeah , w ...
 Interesting .
 Do you recall this conversation ?
 " Leonard , want to go halfsies on a steamer ? "
 " No , Sheldon , we don 't need a steamer . "
 Looks like that rumpled chicken 's come home to roost .
 Hi .
 Here are the make- up sponges you asked for .
 Oh , thanks , I thought I had more .
 Damn , you 've got more makeup than I do .
 You 've got better makeup than I do .
 Yeah , I 'm borrowing this . Hey , hey , hey , hey .
 This is my Comic- Con makeup .
 I love you , but there are some things a man doesn 't share with his girlfriend .
 That 's a wise policy .
 I once borrowed my sister 's makeup for a costume contest .
 Got a terrible case of pinkeye . Yeah , but luckily , I was going as a zombie .
 I won second place .
 I feel like you guys just went to Comic- Con. That was San Diego Comic- Con.
 This is Bakersfield Comic- Con.
 Is that better ?
 Well , it 's a lot smaller . It 's more about the comic books .
 The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood .
 So to answer your question , no , it 's not better .
 Well , then why are you going ?
 It 's a comic book convention .
 You know , it 's like pizza or particle accelerators , even the stinky one 's still pretty good .
 All right .
 Well , you guys have fun . I guess I 'll see you Sunday night . Yeah .
 Okay .
 Oh , hang on a second .
 Hold this .
 What was that for ?

 Oh , this is the best .
 You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday , you got a problem .
 You do it on the weekend , you got brunch .
 Sheldon doesn 't believe in brunch .
 He can 't stand being at a table where one person 's having an omelet and another person 's having a sandwich .
 He 's not exhausting at all .
 ( phone chirps )
 Oh .
 It 's Leonard . he says they 're on the road and headed for Bakersfield at " warp speed . "
 ( chuckles ) Maybe it 's the mimosa , but I 'm gonna give the kid an LOL .
 It 's cute how excited they are .
 You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention .
 When did Howard learn to sew ?
 When he was a little boy , every couple months , he would have to let his mom 's pants out .
 I don 't even understand why they go to these conventions .
 I know . The four of them work at a major university .
 They 're all super smart .
 How can they still be into something made for 12- year- olds ?
 I don 't mind it .
 I think Howie 's just in touch with his inner child .
 Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pajamas , sometimes it feels like I 'm touching his inner child .
 It 's probably because they were bullied growing up .
 In a world where you can 't fight back , superheroes provide meaningful wish- fulfillment .
 ( groans )
 Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids .
 Although , in my defense , if Danny Biffle didn 't want to eat a mouthful of dirt , he shouldn 't have shown up to school wearing a bow tie .
 I 've never even read a comic book .
 You guys ? Uh- uh . No .
 I mean , it 's such an important part of their lives .
 Maybe we should try reading some .
 Seriously ?
 The comic book store isn 't far from here .
 That is an amazing idea .
 Okay , how many of these have I had ?
 I think you should turn on the GPS .
 It is on .
 But the turn- by- turn voice option isn 't on .
 I know I 'd feel more safe if you turn on the turn- by- turn voice option .
 I love the turn- by- turn voice option . ( quietly ) :
 Has it really only been ten miles ?
 I 'm turning it on , but just to shut you up . Leonard , bear left and continue on Interstate 210 . SHELDON 'S VOlCE ( on GPS ) :
 Ooh , sounds like that fellow knows what he 's talking about .
 I 'd put on my listening ears if I were you .
 What did you do ?
 I found a hack online .
 I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS .
 That is so cool .
 Counterpoint , no , it 's not . SHELDON 'S VOlCE : Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles .
 Here 's an interesting fact about interstates .
 Really ?
 Shh , he said it 's interesting .
 Interstates are numbered as follows . Even- numbered routes run east and west , odd- numbered routes run north and south .
 Three- digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs .
 ( Sheldon mouthing with audio )
 Look , Leonard , there 's a bridge .
 Drive off it . You know , we 're not that far from Vazquez Rocks .
 Oh , they shot a lot of episodes out there .
 We 've got our costumes in the trunk .
 We could go there and have a little photo shoot .
 Great idea .
 I haven 't had a carbohydrate in two weeks . These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they 're gone .

 Yeah , that sounds fun .
 Oh , smashing .
 Now , Leonard , do you know how to get there ? No .
 Yeah , well luckily , someone in the car does .
 SHELDON 'S VOlCE :
 Recalculating . While we 're waiting , do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law ?
 The answer , coming up in 14 miles .
 None of you will get it .
 It 's Eisenhower .
 Why are they staring ?
 Who cares ?
 Just soak it in .
 Hello , boys .
 Oh , hey . Could you please stop staring ?
 They 're just girls .
 It 's nothing you haven 't seen in movies or in drawings .
 Hey , Stuart .
 Wh- What brings you guys here ?
 We were looking for a recommendation about comic books .
 Oh , well , I recommend you don 't open a store and sell them .
 No , we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much , so we thought we 'd give it a try .
 Oh , okay . What do you think you might be into ? Superhero , fantasy , graphic novels , manga --
 I swear I will turn a hose on you .
 What kind of comics do the guys like ?
 Um , a litt bit of everything .
 Mostly superhero stuff .
 All right , well , who 's the best superhero ? Shh !
 You can 't ask a question like that in here .
 Are you trying to start a rumble ?
 Well , what do you recommend ?
 Well , uh , let 's see . You 've got your basic clean- cut good guys --
 Superman , Spider- Man , Captain America . Then you have your darker anti- heroes -- your Batman , your Wolverine , Punisher .

 Ooh , I do love a bad boy .
 As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters .
 If I were you , I 'd go for number one .
 The artwork is sophisticated , it 's intelligently written , and it doesn 't objectify or stereotype women .
 Ooh , Thor !
 He 's hot .
 Yeah , he kind of is .
 And we 're blending , and we 're blending , and we 're done .
 KOOTHRAPPALl :
 I know Mr. Data isn 't supposed to smile , but here it comes .
 WOLOWlTZ :
 Come on , guys . Let 's do this .
 Yeah , I 'm sweating my bald cap off .
 So what 's our first pose going to be ?
 I say we begin with a classic fight scene .
 I 'll set the timer .
 Sheldon , how is that a fight pose ?
 Mr. Data 's weapon is his mind .
 I 'm wielding it .
 ( shutter clicks )
 Phasers on the Borg !
 ( shutter clicks )

 ( shutter clicks )
 Okay , what 's next ?
 Now let 's do some sexy glamour shots .
 I 'll set the mood . ( beat- boxing ) :
 Oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz ... oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz ... oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz , oontz .
 Yeah , nice one . Oontz , oontz , oontz .
 That 's right .
 Oontz , oontz , oontz .
 ( car door slams ) ( engine revving ) Oh , my God .
 Leonard , someone 's stealing your car !
 What ? Hey , hey !
 Come back here ! Stop !
 Stealing is against the law !
 I don 't believe this .
 Son of a bitch .
 I 'll call 911 . Wha ...
 Oh , no , my phone is in my other pants .
 Oh , so is mine . Mine , too .
 Anybody got any ideas ?
 Nope .
 The only thing left to do now is assign blame .
 Nice going .

 What kind of a person steals another person 's car in broad daylight ?
 What kind of person leaves his keys in the car ?
 I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali 's fault .
 You 're right .
 Nice going .
 Car .
 ( car approaches )


 What is wrong with people ?
 Why don 't they stop ?
 Maybe we 're better off .
 What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person ?
 Look at us , Sheldon . We 're the crazy people .
 Well , perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence .
 Good idea .
 Why don 't you get started on that ?
 Come on , let 's just start walking .
 There 's got to be a gas station or something nearby . What , you think just because you 're wearing a captain 's uniform , you 're in charge ?
 Yes .
 All right .


 Hmm , okay , I 'm done . How did you guys finish so fast ?
 I don 't know , there were a lot of pictures , and one page only had the word " brakkadoom ! "
 Yeah , well , I have street smarts .
 So , what 'd you guys think ?
 Well , there was a lot of action , Mmm . and the story moved along at a brisk pace .
 It was , overall ... what 's the word I 'm looking for ?
 Stupid ? So stupid .
 I don 't know how Leonard can get so caught up in this .
 It 's crazy ; they spend hours arguing about things that don 't even exist .
 What a waste of time .
 I know .
 A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up ? ( chuckles )
 I don 't think it 's heavy .
 It 's some sort of magic , so only Thor can lift it . That makes even less sense , I mean ...
 No , no , no , it doesn 't .
 Thor is a god .
 The hammer is his ; only he can use it .
 It 's like Sheldon and his toothbrush . Or his thin , beckoning lips .
 Okay , hang on , what if Thor 's hand is on the hammer ?
 I mean , if he 's touching it with his god magic , does that mean I could lift it ?
 No .
 Yes .
 Well , which is it ?
 Maybe we missed something .
 Let 's read it again .
 Okay .
 Yeah .
 ( sighs )
 You want some tea ?
 Good idea .
 I 'll help you .
 Wait , I thought we were reading .
 We are .
 We 're just , uh , giving you a head start .


 I wish my mom was here .
 We could all hang out in her shadow .
 Wool pants in the desert .
 I feel like I 've got poached testicles .
 Oh , you poor thing ; you 're sweating .
 That 's so much worse than having your car stolen .
 Insurance is gonna buy you a new car . It 's not gonna de- funk my junk .
 Gentlemen , a little less bellyaching .
 We 're Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective . Please , Sheldon , I am so not in the mood .
 Leonard , all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love .
 And look at us .
 At this moment , we are , in fact , a landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment , relying only on our wits , our fortitude ( car approaches ) and our moxie .
 As long as we have those things , nothing can stop ...
 MAN :
 Nerds !

 I hate this planet .

 It says right here on the hammer ,
 " Whoever holds this hammer , if he be worthy , shall possess the power of Thor . "
 Hold on , who decides who 's worthy ? Does the hammer decide ?
 Yes ! No !
 It can 't decide .
 It 's a hammer .
 You said it 's a magic hammer .
 Yeah , it can 't make decisions . If Harry Potter 's wand can make decisions , why can 't Thor 's hammer ?
 Okay , if you 're going to start comparing wands and hammers ,
 I can 't even take you seriously .

 Hello .
 Hello .
 Uh , four glasses of water , please .
 Anything for you guys ?
 Can I use your phone ?
 Our car got stolen .
 Why don 't you ask Scotty to beam you up ? ( laughter )
 Scotty was on the original series , and we 're
 So ... joke 's on you .
 We 're not with him .

 You can 't pick something up in outer space .
 In space , there is no up . Oh , yeah ?
 Then how does the sun come " up " every day ?
 Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts .


 Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall .
 Why don 't we go look at those ? Oh , great ! Yes !
 And then you will see .
 I am not wrong , because if we were in outer space , then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment .
 Yeah , that 's right , the slow reader used science . Suck on that .

 Was there anything valuable in the car ?
 Our clothes , our wallets , phones .
 And about $300 worth of makeup , so this thief could look like anyone right now .
 Makeup ? Sure .
 Uh , we 're going to the Comic- Con in Bakersfield .
 They have a big costume contest .
 It 's cooler than it sounds .
 I don 't know , sounds pretty cool .
 I- It is . It 's not just comic books .
 They 've got action figures , toys , a Tron- themed dance party ...
 Okay , he gets how cool it is .
 I think I have all I need here .
 You guys need me to call someone ? I 'm guessing your moms ?

 Thanks , but we 've got it covered .
 Okay , I just talked to my mom .

 She arranged for us to get a rental car .
 Great . We can still make it to Comic- Con.
 Are you kidding me ?
 After all we 've been through , I just want to go home .
 Don 't be like that .
 Come on , Howard , talk to him . I 'm with Leonard .
 I 'm done .
 Fine , then I guess it 's two against two .
 How do we decide ?
 Actually , it 's three against one .
 What ? ! What about the mission ? You said we were a real- life landing party .
 Yeah , well , we 're not .
 We 're an imaginary landing party who had real- life garbage thrown at us by real- life strangers who think we 're idiots .
 And to tell you the truth ,
 I 'm starting to feel like one . I want to go home now .
 Okay .
 Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise ?

 Get it ?
 Enterprise ?
 Screw you . That 's funny .

 Well , what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer ?
 Yeah ?
 Then by the transitive property of picking things up , Hulk picked up the hammer .
 No .
 Hulk picked up Thor , Thor picked up the hammer .
 Okay , hang on .
 If I go to a bar and pick up a guy , and he picks up a girl , and then we all leave together , did I pick up the girl ?
 Did that ever happen ?
 Hey , are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor ?


 Well , I say that 's the last time we ever go outside .
 AMY :
 Look , right here .
 Red Hulk is picking up Thor 's hammer
 ' cause Thor 's touching it . PENNY :
 No , it 's because they 're in space .
 BERNADETTE : He 's really just touching the strap . AMY :
 The strap is part of the hammer ! PENNY : No , it 's not !
 Are they actually arguing about comic books ?
 No , that can 't be right .
 Maybe " Thor 's Hammer " is a new color of nail polish .
 BERNADETTE :
 Then Red Hulk must be worthy .
 PENNY :
 How could Red Hulk be worthy ?
 BERNADETTE :
 You don 't know his life !
 There 's only one logical explanation .
 Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension ... where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature .
 If it 's an alternate dimension ... sounds like a job for a landing party .

 Captain , what are your orders ?
 I say we investigate .

 Wait .
 They might be hostile .

 Fine , but set them to stun .
 If we vaporize Penny ,
 I 'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again .



 SHELDON 'S VOlCE :
 President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room .
 Wow , that is interesting . You learn something new every day .

 Say , can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system ? SHELDON 'S VOlCE :
 Ooh , another quiz .
 Yes !
