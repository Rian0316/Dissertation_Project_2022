 Not at the moment , I 'm not .
 Are you ? No , it 's hard enough to get women to go out with me .
 Right . Yeah , I 've heard that about cute doctors .
 No , reaIly .
 I suppose it 's because I spend so much time , you know . . . . . . where I do .
 I try not to Iet work affect my personaI Iife .
 But it 's hard when , when you do . . . . . . what I do . It 's Iike . . . .

 This is so great !
 Do you wanna explain that ?
 I mean , when I was growing up , my dad Ieft . . . . . . and my mother died and my stepfather went to jail .
 I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one .
 And here 's this baby who has three whole parents . . . . . . who care so much that they fight over who gets to love it the most . . . . . . and it 's not even born yet !
 It 's just the Iuckiest baby in the whole world .
 I 'm sorry . You were fighting .
 Where are they ?
 - I 'm sure they 'II be here soon . - They wouldn 't miss this .
