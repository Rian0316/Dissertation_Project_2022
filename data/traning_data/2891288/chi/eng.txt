 00 : 00 : 02, 144 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 945 So , anyway , last night on video chat , I spent , like , 20 minutes just staring into Lucy 's eyes . Oh , that sounds romantic .
 It was until I realized the screen had frozen .
 Still one of my top three dates of all time .
 So , are we ever gonna hang out with this girl ?
 I 'd love that , but she 's not really comfortable around people .
 Yeah , I used to be uncomfortable around people , but then I learned a trick .
 I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from
 How 's that been working for you ?
 Oh , like a charm , unnamed crewman in a red shirt .
 Leonard , I may have gotten you a job . I have a job .
 SHELDON : Yes , he does .
 He caters to my every whim .
 No , in a couple of weeks , Stephen Hawking 's team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes .
 One of their experimental physicists dropped out , and I recommended you .
 Well , do you really think I have a shot ? Yeah , I 've worked with Hawking .
 I talked you up . He knows your research .
 I think this could happen . He knows -- Wow !
 Well , now , but do you think that 's a good idea ?
 Uh , you know
 Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition ? Hey , don 't discourage him .
 This is a fantastic opportunity . No one asked you , Uhura .

 Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid ? What do you think ?
 Great .
 I 've been doing some reading about vehicular safety .
 Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats ?
 Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat .
 Well , that 's the thing about factoids -- they 're interesting .

 I know what you 're doing .
 You don 't want me going on this research trip because you 're afraid to be alone . I 'm not afraid to be alone .
 On land .

 On the sea , it would be terrifying .
 Because of all the drowning . Sheldon .
 Who do you think would win in a fight -- you or a shark ? Fine , no more drowning talk .
 I 'll change the subject . Oh .

 Look , I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness .
 If I get the chance to do this , there is nothing you can say that 's going to stop me . Very well .

 Things between you and Penny have never been better .
 I hope four months apart doesn 't change anything . ( car stops )

 Original Air Date on May 16 , 2013 If you look carefully at Venus , you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by .
 Wow .
 Your friend was actually up there ? Yeah .
 He brought me back a T- shirt that said , " My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T- Shirt "
 Did he take the T- shirt to space ?
 Nope .
 It 's exactly as lousy as advertised . Speaking of friends , they have been asking to meet you .
 I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime ?
 I don 't know .
 How many are there ? Let 's see . Six .
 That 's pretty cool ; I have six friends !
 Kind of like Sinatra .
 Six strangers ?
 That 's a lot of pressure .
 Staring at me , asking me personal questions . Like , " What do you do " " Where are you from ? "
 " Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom ? " Okay , how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them ?
 Will you be there ?
 Of course .
 Well , that 's two . Three if you count me .
 Oh , this is getting out of hand .
 So , then , during my afternoon shift ,
 I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself .
 Oh , that 's awful .
 Not really . My shirt was soaking wet .
 I got , like , the biggest tip of my life .
 Oh .
 So , listen , do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water ?
 I thought I said that to you .
 Anyway , Stephen Hawking 's team is looking into that , and I 've been invited to join them .
 Wow , Hawking !
 Good for you ! Well , it is .
 Just -- you know , I 'd be gone for a while .
 Well , how long ?
 Three , four months . Whoa .
 When would you leave ?
 Couple weeks . ( gasps ) Wow .
 O- Okay , well , I 'll just come visit you .
 That 's the thing -- you can 't .
 I 'll be on a ship in the North Sea .
 On a ship ? Aren 't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard ?
 Uh , he 's not gonna be there .
 He 's just sending a team to research his theory .
 Oh , sure . Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub .
 Wow .
 Okay .
 Four months .
 Yeah .
 And I 'm a little worried because things between us have been so great , and I 'd hate to do anything that screws that up .
 Oh , sweetie , if you 're gonna screw things up , it 's gonna be while you 're here , not while you 're away .
 Oh .
 No .
 I mean , look , you have to go .
 It sounds like an amazing opportunity . And I 'm just basing that on how much I didn 't understand what you said about it .
 Okay .
 I 'll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning .
 ( sighs ) Okay . Good .
 I do have to ask you one favor .
 Sure .
 Sheldon 's nervous about me leaving .
 Just keep an eye on him while I 'm gone .
 Oh , I don 't know . Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish ?
 Well , flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one .
 ( laughs )
 Really , you guys do not need to throw me a going- away party .
 Are you kidding me ? How often can you say " Bon voyage " to somebody when they 're actually going on a

 Hello , Rajesh .
 ( imitating Koothrappali ) :
 Hello , Amy .
 Nice to see you .
 What can I say ?
 It 's funnier with the accent .
 There 's beer in the fridge .
 Anyway , you guys really don 't need to make a big deal .
 Leonard , you 're being selfish . We need to give you a proper send- off so we 'll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face .
 Sheldon , sweetie , shut up .
 BERNADETTE :
 You know , one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left .
 Bernadette , sweetie , shut up .
 Okay .
 ( sighs ) I have a request to make .
 And now he can talk . I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck 's going on in there .
 The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil .
 Anyway ,
 I- I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all , and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one .
 Oh , gee , I don 't know .
 My schedule 's a little busy .
 Actually , I was thinking Leonard .
 Oh . Thank you , Raj .
 I 'd be honored .
 What the hell ?
 I thought I was your best friend .
 You are , but you 've got kind of a big personality , with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger .
 PENNY :
 You know , maybe she 'd be more comfortable meeting a girl first .
 Good idea . Bernadette ?
 What the hell ? !
 Well , you 're very pretty .
 That could be intimidating to another woman .
 Oh , yeah .
 Hey , you don 't think I 'm pretty enough to scare your girlfriend ?
 Calm down , Bernie .
 You 're very scary .

 It should be me .
 Why ?
 So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain ?
 A , that was not a joke .
 That was a sincere request . And B , more importantly , I was the outsider to this group , and I know how frightening that can be .
 But you guys took me in and made me feel loved ,
 like I was family .

 Fine , I 'll do it .
 So , after I started dating Sheldon , I met Leonard , and then everybody else , and they 've all been so wonderful to me .

 That 's really nice to hear .
 Maybe next week , we could all get together .
 Oh , Lucy , you don 't have to answer that .
 Don 't put her on the spot . She hates that . Am I right ?
 Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot . Go ahead , tell her . Ignore him .
 He 's a little nervous 'cause he doesn 't think
 I understand the severity of your social anxiety .
 What the ... ? Are you crazy ?
 You can 't talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety .
 It makes them socially anxious !
 Excuse me , but I 'm a neurobiologist .
 I think I 'm a little more qualified than you to understand what 's not working in your girlfriend 's brain !
 Don 't call her my girlfriend .
 We haven 't discussed whether or not we 're girlfriend or boyfriend yet .
 Now that it 's out there ... ... are you my girlfriend ? By the way , if you say no ,
 I 'll never be happy again .
 Not to put you on the spot . I think I have to go to the bathroom .

 We might as well go ahead and eat .
 She 's not coming back anytime soon .


 This is ridiculous .
 We 're shopping for a party .
 This store doesn 't even have a party section .
 Yeah , it does , and here we are .
 You know , I have to say , Penny ,
 I don 't understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this .
 Well , I 'm his girlfriend ; of course I 'm gonna support him . Yeah , well , you 're his girlfriend for now .
 You know , maybe you 're not aware of this , but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other 's arms and britches .
 Honey , this is a big deal for Leonard , okay ?
 He gets to work with Stephen Hawking .
 Who , by the way , will not be on the boat .
 I checked it out . It 's not that big of an opportunity .
 And even if Hawking 's theories are correct , all they prove is where the universe came from , why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be .
 I mean , me ?
 I 'm interested in the big questions .
 Oh , my God , Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard .
 I 'm not jealous .
 I 'm just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me .
 Look , sweetie , this is a natural thing to feel , okay ?
 But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn 't take anything away from you .
 You know what ?
 Let me tell you a little story . Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory , and she wasn 't very good at her job .
 It was you .
 It wasn 't me .
 But she was also an actress , and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial .
 She got it . Look , I was so jealous .
 But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair ...
 You ripped out your own fake blonde hair . I ...
 looked her in the eye , smiled and said , " I 'm happy for you . "
 Because that 's what friends do .
 They lie so they don 't look petty .
 Yeah . How ?
 Like this .
 I am so happy for you . Wow .
 No wonder you didn 't get that toothpaste commercial .
 Hey .
 Hi .
 I want to apologize for Amy last night .
 She was completely out of line .

 Are you ... are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again ?
 Amy wasn 't the problem .
 Okay . I know .
 ( sighs )
 It was me . I- I pushed too hard . I 'm sorry .
 Thank you .
 You know , I- I 've been thinking that ... maybe meeting somebody one- on- one is too intense , so ...
 Friday night , my friends are having a party . A party ? A little one !
 It 's- it 's a farewell for Leonard , so all the attention will be on him .
 If you wear something brown and sit on the couch , they won 't even know you 're there .
 I 'm not sure .
 Oh , please ? Raj . Come on .
 Don 't make me beg .
 And I 'm from India , so I know how to do it .
 Okay .
 Y ...
 Thank you ! Th- This means a lot to me .
 My friends are like my family .
 Unless you don 't like them ; in which case , they 're dead to me .
 ( rock music playing quietly ) So , have you ever spent a long time on a boat before ? Yeah .
 Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland ?
 Yeah .
 I 'm proud of you , Leonard .
 Working out on the North Sea for months -- that 's really something .
 I know .
 As far as science goes , this is the adventure of a lifetime .
 ( chuckles ) Maybe your lifetime .
 I went to space .
 It 's not a competition .
 You 're right , you 're right .
 I 'm really proud of you , and ... I 'm gonna miss you when you 're gone .
 And space beats water .
 Rajesh , I thought Lucy was coming .
 She is .
 She 's just running a little late .
 You know how it is -- girls always fussing about their hair , their makeup .
 She 'll be here .
 Just give it a rest , okay ? ( music stops )
 Um , can I have your attention , everyone ?
 That 's , uh , B- flat , for those who don 't have perfect pitch .
 I would like to propose a toast to my best friend , Dr. Leonard Hofstadter .
 He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity , and I couldn 't be happier for him .

 Thank you , Sheldon .
 That must 've been very hard for you to say .
 Well , I mean it .
 I 'm really happy for you .
 And that 's how you get a toothpaste commercial .
 Cheers . Cheers . Cheers .
 It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard .
 Mm .
 Thank you .
 It must 've killed you when I went to space .

 Oh , no .
 Buddy , you okay ?
 Oh , man .
 What 's going on ?
 Uh , go ahead . Read it .
 " Raj , I can 't come to the party . " This is all just " too much for me .
 " I don 't think we should see
 " each other anymore .
 Sorry . Lucy . "
 Excuse me .
 Raj , I 'm so sorry .
 Me , too . ( sighs ) ( door closes )
 It did not kill me when you went to space .
 Monkeys went to space .

 ( sighs )
 Well , here we are .
 Yep .
 I 'm really gonna miss you .
 I 'm gonna miss you , too . Penny , we 're in the red zone .
 The white zone is for loading and unloading .
 We 're breaking the law .
 Okay , there 's no space in the white zone , so ...
 Anyway , we can e- mail , and I- I think the phone connections are pretty good .
 All right , you have to get out of the car right now .
 I 'm not going to jail for you . Would you just relax ?
 Oh , I see a space in the white zone .
 Quick , circle the airport .
 Did you bring enough inhalers ? Yeah .
 And , uh , extra Dramamine ?
 You remember what happened on It 's a Small World .
 I 'm covered . Okay .
 Oh , dear Lord , a police officer 's glancing in our direction . We 've been made .

 Calm down .
 I 'm getting out .
 I have something I want to give you . Oh , Leonard . It 's just a heart- shaped locket with a picture of
 Leonard 's face in it . He got it at the mall on clearance .
 Now move , move , move !
 I love you .
 I love you , too .

 Don 't worry , Officer .
 They just love each other .
 We 're not smuggling drugs .

 Raj , it 's Penny .
 Are you in there ? RAJ : Hang on .

 Hey . I 'm just coming back from the airport .
 I wanted to see how you 're doing .
 That 's- that 's very nice of you . Uh , come , come . Come on in .
 Can 't stay long .
 I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open .
 He 's gonna go through that activity book in , like , 30 seconds , so ...
 Are you okay ?
 No .
 Oh .
 I 'm so sorry . No . It 's my fault .
 You know , I finally found someone who was right for me , and I- I drove her away .
 Oh , Raj .
 Penny , I ...
 I miss her already . I know how you feel .
 I miss Leonard , too . What 's ... what is wrong with me ?

 Why- why can 't I ever have love ?
 You will .
 No , I ... I won 't .
 ( sobbing ) : I 'm- I 'm unlovable .
 ( sighs ) That 's just the booze talking .
 No , it 's not .
 I haven 't had a drink since last night .


 You 're talking to me . I am .
 ( gasps )
 And now I 'm crying for a whole different reason !
 Me , too !




 So I- I guess what I 'm saying is . I get where Lucy 's coming from . That 's great .
 Do you want some wine ?
 Uh , no , water 's fine .
 Anyhow , I- I 've been thinking about it a lot , and- and I totally see why Lucy did what she did .
 I pushed too hard . But you know what ?
 If I back off and give her enough space , maybe there 's still a future for us . Yeah , the funny thing about life is that , you know , sometimes ... ( quietly ) :
 Does he ever shut up ?
