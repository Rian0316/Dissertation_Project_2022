 Come on , Joey !
 I told you everything I knew Iast night .
 It 's not that big a deal . So they 're doing it .
 I cannot believe you would say that ! Sorry .
 Monica and Chandler are making Iove . No , I mean , come on .
 This is a huge deal ! I need more details .
 Who initiated the first kiss ? I don 't know .
 Is he romantic with her ?
 I don 't know .
 Are they in Iove ?
 I don 't know .
 You don 't know anything .
 I know one thing .
 They did it right there .

 Could I have a scone ?
 Want to hear some good news ?
 Someone I know is getting married .
 Weddings are happy occasions .
 Oh , it 's my ex- wife , Emily !
 Sorry , man . - Here 's your scone . - Thanks .
 Stupid British snack food !
 Did they teach you that in anger management ? You know what might help you deaI with it ?
 You two are in the past . You can 't be mad about the past .
 Are you stiII mad about , you know , the Louisiana Purchase ?
 Nobody 's mad about that .
 Exactly ! Because it 's in the past .
 Anybody going to eat that ?

 Look at us aII dressed up for the party . What are we celebrating ?
 We had a Iot of Iiquor Ieft over from Christmas .
 Our friends aren 't here . We can be a reaI couple .
 We don 't have to hide . I know . I can do this .
 And I can do this . We can 't do that .
 Hey , Bing !
 Who 's the pretty Iady , and what is she doing with you ?
 I asked myself that very question , sir . My boss , Doug .
 - This is Monica . - Hi . - This is my wife , Kara .
 - Nice to meet you .

 Did you hear about the new Iaw firm working for us ?
 Dewey , Cheatem & Howe .
 Let 's go drink our body weight .
 What was that ?
 That noise you made ?
 Oh , my work Iaugh .
 Your work Iaugh ? If you 're going to survive this party , come up with one too .
 AII right .
 Check me out .
 He says , " $30 , Father .
 Same as in town . "

 Everybody at work loved you Iast night . And they Iike me more just because I was with you .
 You repaired the damage from when they met Joey .
 Doug wants to play tennis .
 He never talks to me outside of work . Except for that time at that strip club .
 Strip church .
 - I 'II go find a racket . - I thought you had one .
 I used to , but then Joey thought it 'd be fun to go hit rocks . . . . . . at bigger rocks .
 Do you have a tennis racket ? I Ient it to Joey and I 've never gotten it back .
 Good Iuck with that .
 What 's up ?
 Why are you here ?
 I thought you had inventory .
 I do , but I decided I 'd take a Iong Iunch . . . . . . and spend some time with my friend , Monica .
 You know , I feeI Iike we don 't talk anymore .
 How are you ? What is new with you ?

 Not much . Work 's good .
 We don 't have to talk about work . Talk about anything .

 You know what ?
 Let 's talk about relationships .
 What 's going on ? Nothing .
 You go . There was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute .
 But I don 't anymore .
 That 's juicy .
 You know what ? I actuaIly do have a Iot of work to do .
 You 're sure there 's just not anything else ?
 I 'm sure .
 Is there something you want to talk to me about ?
 No !
 If there was , I wouldn 't teII you .


 Then what happened ?
 You 'II get your turn .
 - Hey , Pheebs .
 What 's going on ?
 - Nothing .
 This is not over .
 No , no , no !
 I was up aII night writing this nasty Ietter to Emily .
 It was perfect , and now it 's aII covered in . . . . ActuaIly , thanks !
 AII right ! Ready to go to the movies ?
 ActuaIly , I think I 'II skip it .
 ReaIly ? I 'II read my book .
 I just want to be alone right now . Sure you don 't want to ?
 Tom Hanks , Meg Ryan .
 They get maiI and stuff .
 That 's okay , Joe .
 Let 's go , Pheebs .





 Game !
 I got to teII you , that partner of yours is a reaI tiger .
 Are you aII right ?
 We 'II just get a Iittle sip of water .
 Am I on fire today or what ? Those birds are browned , basted and ready to be carved .
 Okay , easy , Martina .
 I think we should Iet them win the next game .
 I 'm sorry , I don 't understand what you just said . Let them win one .
 Are you crazy ?
 We own those two . Look at them ! He can 't even breathe , and she 's popping piIls .
 You 're not giving them a chance .
 They have rackets .
 We 'II make this the Iast game . Yes , sir .
 Put me out of my misery .
 Are you sure you never played pro ? Please Iet them win .
 I 'II take it down to 95 % , but that 's the best I can do .

 - Missed it !
 - I got it !

 Nice shot .


 I got it !
 Long !

 I can 't believe you Iet them win .
 WeIl , at Ieast you hid your feelings weII about it .
 I was frustrated .
 It 's my racket .
 Frustrated with you !
 If we hadn 't Iost , they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow .
 What bothers me . . . . . . is how different you act around them .
 The throwing the tennis games , the fake Iaugh . . . . . . the " See you Iater , Bing ! " " Not if I see you first , Doug ! "
 I don 't Iike " work Chandler . " The guy 's a suck- up .
 Because you said that . . . . . . I 'm not putting out tonight !


 Something 's wrong .
 My brother doesn 't stay out aII night . Maybe we should check the trash chute .
 Ross couldn 't fit down the trash chute . That 's right . He almost could .
 Which is exactly how I got stuck there .
 Oh , my God !
 Where the heII have you been ?
 Just , you know , out . Oh , out !
 God , I don 't know why we didn 't think to check there . What were you doing ?
 I went to a bar and then . . . . . . I just walked around for a while .
 You walked around aII night in the city by yourself ?
 He hooked up !
 He hooked up .
 I don 't have to answer your questions .
 I 'm a big boy . I can do what I want . He hooked up !
 TeII us about her !
 Ross , you Ieft your scarf --

 Hey , you guys .




 I know what you aII are thinking , but Chandler is in Yemen .
 I 'm a young woman .
 I have needs . I can 't wait forever .
 Yeah , that 's what I was thinking .
 So I 'm asking you , please just take a moment before you judge me . Nobody 's judging you .
 Mr. Right- place- at- the- right- time . . .
 . . . caII me .
 I know what you guys are going to say .
 You two would have very hairy children . I didn 't know you 'd say that .
 Ross ! Janice ? AII right .
 Hold on , hold on .
 This is Ross . He 's our friend . He obviously went crazy .
 He obviously Iost his mind .
 I didn 't Iose my mind , okay ?
 Janice and I have a Iot in common .
 We 've both been divorced .
 We both have kids . Are you going to see her again ?
 - Don 't put ideas in his head ! - I wiII see her . Damn it , Phoebe !


 I have to teII you something that I 've never admitted .
 In high school , I made out with James even though I knew you Iiked him .
 That feels so good to get off my chest .
 Okay , you go . My turn ? What are you talking about ?
 I know about you and Chandler .

 I overheard you on the phone the other day .
 You said , " I 'II teII RacheI I 'm doing Iaundry for a couple of hours . "
 And he said , " Laundry ?
 Is that my new nickname ? " And you said :
 " You know what your nickname is , Mr. Big . "
 You 're writing yourself a Iittle play there , Rach .

 Let me know how it turns out .
 I wouldn 't know because I got so freaked out I hung up the phone .
 WeIl , if you had kept Iistening . . . . . . you would have heard me caII him Mister . . . . . . Bigot .
 Mr. Bigot .
 He teIls the most racist jokes . AII right .
 So that 's it .
 There 's nothing going on between you and Chandler ? Me and Chandler ?

 Put your $20 down . First one to find the tasty treat wins , okay ?
 AII right , Iet 's get the contestants out of their isolation booths .
 And they 're off !
 Get your foot off my contestant ! Judge ?
 Judge rules no violation .
 It 's so weird to say this , but I just had a great date with Janice .
 - What ?
 - Are you serious ? I opened up to her about aII the stuff that 's been happening to me .
 I mean , I talked for hours .
 It is amazing . . . . . . to have someone give you such focused attention .
 You don 't need Janice for that . You 've got us . The duck gets the Nutter Butter !
 That 's not a Nutter Butter .
 That 's an old won ton !
 Judge rules . . . . . . Nutter Butter . Tough caIl .
 Seriously , I strongly believe that we should support President Clinton . . . . . . and her husband , BiIl .
 How do you Iike your coffee ?
 - None for me .
 - A Iittle sugar .
 I 'II have Monica stick her finger in it . That wiII sweeten it up .

 - That Iaugh doesn 't give you a headache ?
 - You get used to it . I don 't think that I can .
 This wiII be it for me on the work things .
 I Iaugh at my boss 's jokes . What 's the big deal ?
 I 'd rather not be with this work- weaseI guy . . . . . . when I can be with my boyfriend , who I actuaIly respect .
 I got to apologize for Kara 's coffee .
 I 'd feeI sorry for it in a fight .
 It 's not strong enough to defend itself .

 Hear what I said ? What ?
 It 's a joke .
 What 's the matter with you ?
 WeIl , I just didn 't think it was funny , sir .
 Excuse me ?
 - WeIl , I just -- - Honey ?
 I just don 't think you understood the joke .
 ReaIly ?
 I mean , it was reaIly funny . I just don 't think that you got it .
 You see , Kara 's coffee is weak- tasting .
 But what Doug did was imply that it was weak physicaIly .
 - You get it now , honey ? - I think I do !
 - Thank you , Monica .
 - I thought you could use the help .
 Coffee in a fight !

 You mind if I read my comic books in here ?
 Sure .
 Why ?
 Chandler and Monica are over there . It 's kind of hard to concentrate .
 She just caIled and said she was going to be working Iate .
 She keeps Iying to me . That 's it ! I 'm going over there and confronting them right now .

 AII right , so you 're teIling me that I have to teII racist jokes now ?
 I 'm just not very good at this .
 I 'm a terrible Iiar .
 I hate having to Iie to Rachel . - But we 're not ready to teII yet . - I know .
 Ever since high school , RacheI was the one person that I told everything to .
 I miss that so much now . She 's my best friend .


 Oh , my God , Rachel !
 What are you doing here ?
 WeIl , I actuaIly came over here to borrow this Iamp . . . . . . to Iook at my books . You know , see them a Iittle better .
 Okay , great .
 WeIl , what I was doing in Chandler 's room is that . . . . . . I was cleaning it .
 He pays me to clean it .
 What a great way to make some extra pocket money .
 When I said to you earlier that I was at work . . . . . . I 'm at my new work .
 Good enough .
 Right ?
 I 'II go Iook at my books .
 Go get back to my new job .

 Congratulations on your new job !


 Man , she is reaIly guIlible .


 - Here you go . - Thanks . - ActuaIly , I should get going .
 - You 're sure ? I can stay out as Iate as you want .
 I told you I 'm on sabbaticaI from work -- Yes , yes .
 You did . - Oh , man ! - What is wrong now ?
 This isn 't what I ordered . Man !
 Can 't anything go right in my Iife ? First , my marriage faIls apart , and then --
 I know !
 You Iose your apartment , you Iose your job . . . . . . your ex- wife gets married so fast ! And now the coffee !
 We need to talk .
 - Sometimes I feel -- - No , no , don 't .
 I 'm going to talk .
 I believe . . . . . . that the sun has set . . . . . . on our day in the sun .
 You 're a very sweet person , Ross .
 Unfortunately . . . . . . I just don 't think I can take another second of you whining !
 Let me make sure I 'm hearing this right .
 You 're ending this with me because . . . . . . I 'm too whiny ?
 So you 're saying . . . . . . I 've become so whiny . . . . . . that I. . . . . . annoy you . . .
 . . . Janice .
 WeIl , yeah ! Oh , my God !
 WiII you be okay ?
 I am now .

 I guess , that 's two out of three . . .
 . . . Joey !

 Dude , we got to talk .
 I want to teII you something before you heard it from someone else .
 I hope this isn 't too weird but . . .
 . . . I had a thing with Janice .


 You 're not mad ? Why would I be mad ?
 Because there 's certain rules about this kind of stuff .
 You don 't fooI around with your friends ' ex- girlfriends . . .
 . . . or possible girlfriends or girls they 're related to .
 I am mad .
 But you know , I 'm going to forgive you .
 Because that 's what friends do .
 They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said .
 Thank you .
 But I want you to remember . . . . . . that I forgave you .
 I also want you to remember that I Iet you Iive here rent- free .
 AII right .
 And I want you to remember that I gave you . . . . . . twenty- seven doIlars .
 No strings attached !
 If you can 't remember that . . . . . . we should write it down .
 Let 's write it down !
