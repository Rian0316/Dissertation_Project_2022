 00 : 00 : 14, 891 -- > 00 : 00 : 18, 076 This is nice , that we all get to eat together . Mm- hmm . Mm- hmm .
 Absolutely .
 Hmm .
 Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actual human conversation ?
 We can , but thanks to Steve Jobs , we don 't have to .
 Guys , guys , you 're never gonna believe this . What happened ?
 I just got a part on a TV show ! What ? That 's great !
 Congratulations ! Guys !
 Oh , yeah !
 Yay , Penny ! What 's the show ?

 Um , NC ... Il ... or , you know , NCSTD ...
 I don 't know , it 's- it 's the one with the letters and I 'm gonna be on it ! That 's amazing .
 Yeah . What 's your part ?
 Um , I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon .
 Ooh , Mark Harmon , he 's a dreamboat .
 So i- it 's just flirting ? Well , yeah . Why ?
 Uh , no reason .
 I just think it 's sexier when things are left to the imagination .

 Original Air Date on January 2 , 2014
 So I- I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman 's phone number .
 Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue ?
 I don 't see why not .
 If you 're really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth ,
 I could set you up with my mom .
 ( all but Sheldon laughing ) Why is that funny ?
 That 's just unhygienic .
 It 's a joke .
 I don 't think so .
 I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist .
 For example , uh , Wolowitz 's mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet ... or exercise , or both .
 See ?
 The twist is that people don 't usually change .
 ( laughs )
 Well , they don 't .
 Hey , guys , don 't forget , my episode 's on TV tomorrow night .
 We 'll be there . Can we bring anything ?
 Oh , that 's so sweet of you , but I was gonna steal food from here . You know ... my treat .
 Wait , if Howard 's mother is coming , then you should also steal marbles .
 ( laughs )
 Because she 's obese , and hippos are obese , and in the popular board game " Hungry Hungry Hippos , " they eat marbles .
 Maybe I need to dumb these down for you .
 Leonard , do you think I 'm funny ?
 No .


 Do you ?
 I think I 'm hysterical .
 I take it back .
 That was funny .
 The philosopher Henri Bergson says it 's funny when a human being behaves like an object .
 I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut .
 Oh , he didn 't perform stand- up comedy , he was a philosopher .
 You know , I think we 're zeroing in on your problem .
 Perhaps I 'll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy , which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time .
 Unless they 're German ,
 ' cause that 's a tough crowd .
 Are you set on people laughing you ?
 ' Cause if you 're cool with you ...

 I don 't get it .
 Raj , when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny 's thing tonight ,
 I didn 't think you meant Stuart .
 Really ?
 I never for a second thought it 'd be anything else .
 I almost met someone last night , but I blew it .
 I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself , but she was so cute I panicked and said , " Wouldn 't it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other 's butts ? "
 Well , Stuart 's cute in his own way .
 When I was a baby , my mother called me her little possum .
 Are possums cute ? Not at all .
 If you 're so intimidated by talking to attractive girls , maybe you should practice by talking to regular people .
 You mean like fatties and uggos ?
 Or maybe just stop talking .
 I 'm serious .
 Go to the mall , talk to anybody , practice -- that way , when you eventually do talk to a cute girl , it won 't be so scary .
 Or just keep dating the possum .
 TONY ( on TV ) :
 Parsa doesn 't have those kind of resources .
 McGEE :
 No , and that 's why he had Erin Pace rewire it ...
 I 'm so proud of you . We haven 't even gotten to my scene yet .
 I know , but you 're going to be a TV star and you haven 't left me yet .
 That takes guts .
 I don 't know about you , but I 'm very uncomfortable with all this .
 Why ?
 I 've never seen this show before and now I 'm starting with episode 246 ?
 It 's unnatural .
 Just think of the first 245 as the prequel .
 All right .
 Okay , shh .
 Guys , guys , this is it .
 I guess it 's you and me , kid .
 What are you doing ?
 I 'm trying to make peace .
 We 're good .
 Good . Really ? Because ...
 Are you kidding me ? ( TV shuts off ) What 's wrong ?
 Well ... the diner scene .
 Where 's my diner scene ?
 Well , don 't ask me . Until I see the prequel , I 'm lost .
 No , there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon , but i- it 's ... gone .
 What happened ? They must 've cut it .
 Oh , Penny ... I 'm ...
 I 'm sorry .
 That stinks . I 'm sure you were great .
 This doesn 't make any sense . I mean , I ... I thought I did a ... a really good job , I ...
 Excuse me .

 I 've been studying how to make people laugh . They say that comedy is tragedy plus time .

 Let 's tickle some ribs .
 No , Dad ,
 I don 't think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty .
 No , I don 't need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon 's ass .
 Daddy , I gotta go .
 I love you . Bye . How you doing ?
 Ugh , this is such a disaster .
 My parents had all my relatives over .
 They got one of those six- foot sandwiches , and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and ... ... now he 's missing and the sandwich is missing , and ...
 They 're probably in Mexico by now .
 So humiliating .
 You still got the part .
 That 's a huge accomplishment .
 Yeah , but this was supposed to be my break , okay ? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things .
 More auditions , more parts ...
 Now none of that 's gonna happen .
 Honey , you only had , like , three lines .
 That wasn 't gonna happen anyway .

 Unbelievable .
 Oh ... Come on ... no , that 's not what I meant . Then what did you mean ?
 I don 't ...
 Look , you know , words don 't always have to mean things .
 I think you meant that you don 't believe in me .
 Nope .
 Uh- uh ...
 I might not know what I- I meant , but I know that I didn 't mean that .
 Not this guy . Oh , no way .
 I want you , right now , to give me your 100 % honest opinion . Right .
 Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress ?
 Yes .
 So you think I 'll be on TV and in movies and win awards . Honestly ? Yes , honestly .
 I don 't .
 How could you say that ?
 I don 't know ...
 I got all confused when you said " honestly " .
 Oh !
 Look , do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful ?
 Of course I do .
 But isn 't Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented , just as beautiful ?
 All right , look ... we 'll come back to that . No , please .
 Don 't stop , go on .
 Tell me how I 'm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life .
 That is not what I said .
 Look , I think you 're really good . I truly do .
 But this is an incredibly hard thing that you 're shooting for . I mean , the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one .

 Wow , thank you .

 Should 've let Sheldon come .
 This is interesting .
 Apparently , a key component in some forms of humor is the element of surprise .
 Well , that makes sense .
 The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation , and patients with brain lesions on their ...
 Brain lesions !

 Sheldon , you scared me . That wasn 't funny . Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex .
 Okay , the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd .
 I mean , humor is a complex neurological ...
 ( laughing ) :
 Okay , that 's pretty good .
 Excellent .


 How about her ?
 No !
 No pretty girls !
 The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls .
 Fine . How about that old lady with the walker ?
 That depends .
 On any level , do you think she 's hot ? We 'll find somebody else .
 Kumquat ? I guess .
 Ointment ? Sure .
 Now , would you say ointment is more , equal to , or less funny than kumquat ?
 I don 't think I want to go out with you anymore .
 Will you please stop joking around ?
 I 'm trying to figure this out .
 Sheldon , how many words are you gonna go through ?
 All of them .
 You didn 't get your part cut . ( channel changes ) WOMAN :
 All right , baby , here 's the deal . And you didn 't get your part cut .
 ( rock music plays )
 Yep , bunch of old guys rocking out in a band , all with erectile dysfunction , you didn 't get your part cut !
 ( knocking on door )
 Hey .
 Can we talk ?
 We can , but the part of Penny might get cut .
 That was really crappy of me .
 What you 're trying to do hard , but people do make it , and I really do believe you could be one of them .
 Thank you .
 And ... to show you how much I believe in you ,
 I kind of got you an audition .
 Are you serious ? For what ?
 The new movie . What ? !
 How did you manage that ? !
 There 's this thing online , you put yourself on tape and just send it in -- anyone can do it .
 Come on Leonard , this is just a PR stunt . So ?
 Even if it is , you have a huge advantage because you 're an actual actress .
 Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds .
 Wolowitz sent his in two days ago .
 Really , let it go .
 Look , maybe it is a long shot , but sometimes long shots happen .
 Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star .
 He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide , but with the help of The Force , he ...
 Wow , I can feel you hating me right now .
 How about that lady in the sweat suit , speed- walking ? Yeah , she seems friendly and easy to ...
 Never mind , she 's gone .
 Yeah , maybe talking to people is too hard .
 We could go over to that department store , practice on the mannequins . I don 't know .
 They 're dressed very stylishly . They 're probably stuck- up .
 This is ridiculous .
 The next person that walks by , no matter who it is , they 're the one .

 We 're gonna die here .
 Hello .
 Hey . Where 's Sheldon ?
 He 's home trying to use science to determine the basis of humor .
 That 's interesting . It 's exhausting .
 Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock- knock joke that starts with ,
 " Knock- knock- knock , Amy , knock- knock- knock , Amy , knock- knock- knock , Amy " ?
 If you want him to stop , sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh .
 Fake a laugh ?
 Do you ever do that with me ?
 No , of course not . Well , I 'd be able to tell anyway .
 I don 't think you would .
 Please , I 've made plenty of girls laugh , sometimes just by asking them out .
 ( both laugh )
 ( laughter continues )

 Yeah ? Well , I fake my orgasms .
 Yes , how much for a hundred long- stemmed red roses ?
 Really ?
 How much for three ? Hey .
 Yeah , I 'll call you back .
 Look , I know you were just trying to help with your thing .
 I didn 't mean to call it idiotic .
 Well , I don 't think you called it idiotic . Oh .
 Sorry , I meant to .
 Anyway , um , I was just upset with myself .
 I wasn 't mad at you .
 I just feel like everything is falling apart . Come on .
 It 's okay .
 No , it 's not okay !
 Look at me , okay ? ! I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago , and I 'm still doing it .
 I can 't quit , because guess what ?
 I can 't do anything else . And I finally get my big break , and it goes away !
 I 'm such a mess .
 No , you 're not . Really ? !
 ' Cause this morning at Starbucks , a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg ! And it wasn 't the only one in there .


 Okay , listen to me , this is just a minor setback .
 No , it 's not , okay ? ! I 've been out here for , like , ten years !
 I 've nothing to show for it !
 Well , you have me .
 You 're right .
 I do have you .
 ( chuckles ) Mm ...
 Let 's get married .
 What ? ( grunts )
 Ooh !
 ( chuckles )
 Leonard Hofstadter ... will you marry me ?
 Um ... Did you seriously just say , " Um " ? !
 Look , you know I love you , but- but you 're- you 're drunk and sad and feeling lost ...
 Okay , so- so you don 't want to marry me ? !
 That is not what I said . No , forget it ! I take it back !
 Offer 's off the table ! Who 's in the mood to laugh ? !


 Really not a good time .
 But I used science to construct the perfect joke .
 I 'm gonna go .
 Penny , don 't . No , no , I just need to be alone .
 So , a sandwich , a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar .
 Where are you going ? To my room . Should I follow you ?
 No .
 Leonard , wait .
 What ?
 I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous .



 How about those guys on that bench over there ?
 They look pathetic .
 I bet we could talk to them .
 That 's a mirror .
 Oh , yeah .

 Hey , fellas , mall 's closing .
 Sorry . Yeah . Good night .
 Uh , excuse me .
 Yeah ?
 Uh , do- do you like being a mall security guard ?
 It 's all right . Okay , nice talking to you .
 Smooth ... !


 Can 't sleep ? No .
 Would you like to talk about it ?
 Penny proposed , and I didn 't say yes .
 Why not ?
 That 's a good question .
 Does that mean the relationship is over ?
 I don 't know . Why don 't you ask her ?
 Because I 'm afraid to know the answer .
 Well ...
 I 'm sorry .
 That 's it ? You 're not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment ?
 No .
 You 're my friend , and ... I 'm sorry .
 Did you just put a " kick me " sign on my back ?
 No .
 That wouldn 't be funny at all .


 Star Wars audition , take one ... starring Howard Joel Wolowitz , real- life astronaut .



 Vader is here ... now ... on this moon .
 I felt his presence . He 's come for me .
 He can feel when I 'm near ... How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when it 's empty ? !
 AMY :
 I 'm in the middle of something !
 So am I !
