 Lily Pad , you should get ready for school .
 I 'm not going .
 [ coughs ]
 Still feel sick .
 Well , it 's been three days .
 Ola 's called on the house phone again .
 Have you two had a fight ?
 No , we 're fine .
 [ inhales ] Well ,
 I 've got to go to work now .
 Hopefully , you 'll feel better tomorrow .
 [ Hugh , straining ]
 194 , 195 , 196 , 197 , 198 , 199 , 200 .

 Yeah !
 [ panting ]
 [ exclaims ]
 Can you change this bulb for me ?
 [ pants ] Sure .
 [ Hugh breathing heavily ]
 Thank you .
 [ grunts ]
 Ah .
 There you go .
 Bit sweaty . [ chuckles ]
 Sorry .
 I 'll jump in the shower .
 [ radio ]


 - [ phone chimes ]

 [ pensive music playing ]

 [ knocking at door ]
 Yeah ?
 Gotta get my jacket .
 We have our session with Dr. Cutton later today .
 I 'll think about it .
 Good luck with your TV interview .
 [ music continues ]
 Oh f ... [ exhales ]
 Hey .
 Hey .
 I 'm worried about Lily .
 She hasn 't spoken to me since everything that happened with Hope .
 - Could you go talk to her , please ? - I 'm not a therapist , Ola .
 I know , but she told me about how much you helped her with the vaginismus stuff .
 I think she really trusts you .
 I 'm not the right person to ask . Sorry .
 Could you please do up my buckle , Otis ?
 Really ?
 I thought we 'd grown out of the silent treatment phase .
 [ Jean ] Look ,
 I know that you 're both aware that Jakob and I are having some issues , but I want you to still feel that this is your family home and a safe space for you to talk about your feelings .
 Why is my dad not part of this conversation ?
 Your dad feels it 's better not to talk about these things with you guys .
 So you can 't even agree on how to tell us you might be splitting up ?
 Lots of couples have differing opinions on how to parent children .
 Maybe you should have thought about that before you decided to have a baby and make us all pretend to be a bizarre family !
 I 'm going to school !
 - [ door opens ]
 - I 'm sorry .
 - It 's all a bit of a mess . - [ door closes ]
 [ Jean exhales ]
 [ sighs ]
 Everything you do seems to turn into a mess , Mum .
 [ door opens , closes ]
 Through !
 And over ! Over ! Up !
 Yes !
 Well done !
 Yes !
 [ dog barks ]
 - Yeah !
 Good girl . Oh !
 - [ dog barks ]
 Didn 't know she could do that .
 Don 't forget , it 's your uncle Peter 's dinner party this evening .
 Oh , no . I 'm not going . Uncle Peter 's a dick .
 - Adam ! - I 'm just saying .
 You 're not with Dad anymore .
 I don 't know why you 're going .
 Okay . Yeah , you 're right .
 Peter is a bit of a dick .
 But I 'm just trying to ease the adjustment process .
 [ doorbell rings ]
 - Is your friend Eric back ? - Yep . Okay .
 - Bye . - Bye .
 Hey .
 [ Eric ]
 Hey !
 - How are you ? - Yeah , good .
 Yeah ?
 Ooh !
 My mum .
 Mm- hmm .
 Okay , let 's go .
 Hello , Maureen .
 [ laughing ]
 Okay .
 [ pensive music playing ]
 I missed you .
 - I missed you too . - Yeah ?
 Yeah .
 Come .
 Let 's go .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ sighs ]
 [ phone ringing ]
 Hello ?
 [ Erin ]
 - Mum ?

 Where are you ?
 - Mum , you need to bring Elsie ba ...
 - [ dial tone ]
 Have they found Elsie yet ?
 No .
 I think I know where my mum is though .
 [ sighs ]
 So you haven 't been replying to my texts .
 Yeah , well , I am quite annoyed at you right now .
 Fair enough . I would be too .
 Listen , we don 't have to talk about this when you 've got stuff to worry about .
 Okay , fine .
 But I just want you to know that I 'm confused about all of this .
 What am I supposed to say to that , Maeve ?
 If you 're not sure you wanna be with me , then it 's probably not right .
 - Isaac . - Look .
 I need to be with someone who 's sure about me because I think I deserve that .
 And even if you and I were able to work this out ,
 I would still be worried that you 'd regret not trying with Otis , and I can 't do that .
 So with respect ,
 I 'm taking my heart off the table .
 Good luck finding your mum .
 [ rousing instrumental music playing ]
 [ sighs ]
 - You both still wanna do this ? - Absolutely .
 - Yep . - Yes !
 Incoming .
 Happy Open Day !
 Are you prepped ?
 I 'm really looking forward to it .
 That 's good .
 - Eric ! You 're back ! Yes !
 - Hey !
 [ laughs ]
 I missed you ! How was Nigeria ? Tell me everything !
 Oh , it was good . The wedding was great , and my family was the best !
 What are you doing ?
 I 've run out of clean pants , and I 'm chafing real bad .
 [ Otis sighs ]
 - What is that ?
 - It 's my shame sign .
 I threw a poo out the coach window in France .
 Except it wasn 't me .
 It was Rahim .
 We 're kinda friends now .
 - You 're friends with Rahim ? - Kind of .
 Whoa , whoa , wow .
 Wow !
 Wow !
 What ? It 's itchy . You know how big my balls are .
 Okay , fine . But we are in public .
 Go to the bathroom and sort yourself out .
 - Fine . - Fine .
 You need to tell him about the thing .
 What thing ?
 - Hey !
 Sorry . Hi . Have you seen Aimee ?
 - Oh !
 - Hi . No . Maeve ?
 - Okay . Yeah ?
 I was gonna text you to apologize , but that felt pathetic .
 Can we maybe talk ?
 I don 't really have time right now . I think I found my mum , so ...
 - Do you need any help ? - It 's okay . I 'll let you know how it goes .
 [ mischievous music playing ]
 What are we apologizing for ?
 Okay , okay .
 So , in France , and please don 't freak out , but ...
 Maeve and I kissed .
 You okay ?
 I 'm actually speechless .
 What kind of kiss ? A peck- on- the- cheek kiss or a kiss- kiss ?
 [ splutters ] Um , it was a kiss- kiss .
 What happened after this kiss- kiss ?
 Are you guys a couple now ?
 No . I messed it all up again .
 She thinks I don 't care about anything now I don 't do the clinic .
 You think that 's true ?
 You don 't do the clinic anymore because you had your heart broken , and you couldn 't be around Maeve .
 I don 't think you stopped caring .
 I think you had to protect yourself .
 Please , tell me this was at least the best kiss of your entire life !
 - It was pretty amazing . - Aha ! I 'm so proud of you !
 Otis ! Can you help me out with something for the thing ?
 Our computer guy has dropped out , so we need a replacement .
 I thought of you 'cause you seem nerdy .
 - Yes . - Mm- hmm .
 - So , yeah . - Okay . Well , I was kinda hoping to stay out of this one .
 Um , what ? Of course you 'll help .
 I 'll help too .
 Thank you . Hey , be more Eric , okay ?
 Thank you .
 I agree with that , actually .
 What 's the thing ?
 [ mischievous music playing ]
 - Thought you were shutting down the stall .
 - It 's for the thing ! [ Steve ] They look great .
 - Aimee , have you got a sec ?
 - Thought we weren 't talking .
 I 've been an absolute arse .
 Me too . Steve , hold the cakes .
 [ Aimee sighs ]
 [ Maeve ] I 'm so sorry . You 're right .
 I 'm shit at asking for help , and I push people away .
 No . I should never have done what I did without asking first .
 I didn 't realize how hurtful it would be .
 Thing is , I need help now , and you 're the only person I can trust .
 Okay . What we doing ?
 Can you drive me to Lockwood- on- Sea ?
 Right . Steve , you 're in charge of vulvas from now on .
 If anyone asks , the wobbly bits aren 't mistakes because ...
 All vulvas are unique .
 Good lad .
 They better not be squished .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 He does these silly air punches like he 's Bruce Lee or something .
 [ laughs ]
 He bites his fork when he eats .
 It 's only been a few months .
 I shouldn 't be so irritated by him , should I ?
 Are there any positives ?
 We have lots of sex .
 Ooh .
 [ chuckles ]
 Well , a healthy sex life is important for many people .
 I know it won 't last though .
 There was a time that Michael and I couldn 't keep our hands off each other .
 And then it just stopped .
 Well , that doesn 't have to be inevitable .
 Oh , I 've been meaning to tell you that Michael stopped by the other day .
 He was returning something that belonged to me .
 We ended up having a chat . About what ?
 I think he 's struggling a bit and just needed someone to talk to .
 [ scoffs ]
 That 's a bit rich .
 Sorry .
 [ sighs ]
 It 's just ... Why wouldn 't he talk to me all those years ?
 And Adam 's exactly the same .
 [ sighs ]
 It 's just so lonely sometimes with all these men .
 [ Jean ] Well , Adam will talk to you when he 's ready .
 You know , I 'm not very good at letting Otis come to me .
 I admire your restraint .
 - Twenty minutes . - Thank you .
 Oh , that looks nice .
 We are making way for a brighter , cleaner future here at Sparkside Academy .
 You can fucking do this .
 [ woman ] The press are arriving .
 It 's Superman pose .
 It helps with nerves . There 's a TED Talk on it .
 - [ scoffs ]
 - [ clears throat , sniffles ] [ whimsical music continues ]
 Right .
 Making way for a brighter , cleaner future at Sparkside fucking Academy .
 Fuck .
 Yes .
 - Why are you wearing that ? - You told me to .
 Okay , take it off now .
 Yeah .
 - Hope ! It 's a good turnout . - Yes !
 Lots of prospective students , the press , and all our private investors , so , uh , no pressure at all .
 [ chuckles ]
 Right . Well , I 'll be interested to hear your feedback .
 Would you , um , just excuse me a second ?
 Mm . Yeah .
 Cal ?
 Come with me .
 [ Cal ] Get your hands off me !
 You have been told repeatedly to change your behavior , but you are clearly innately disobedient .
 [ scoffs ]
 The press would be interested to hear about the way I 've been discriminated against due to how I present .
 I 'm left with no choice but to keep you in here for the remainder of Open Day .
 - You 're in violation of my rights .
 - [ door rattling ]
 Let me go !
 - [ indistinct chattering ] - [ camera shutters clicking ]
 Well , this ... this is different .
 [ Colin ]
 Oh .
 [ Jackson ] So , yeah , all pretty self- explanatory .
 - Mm- hmm .
 - Um ...
 - Stop . - Okay .
 - Start . - Okay .
 - Dimmer . - Mm- hmm .
 - And do not press these red ...
 - This one ?
 - [ Jackson ] Yeah . Don 't press that .
 - Okay .
 - I 'll keep him ... - [ Eric ] Okay .
 - [ Jackson ] Yeah ? - [ Eric ]
 Yeah .
 I mean , I was imagining something more center stage , but this is cool .
 It 's likewe 're in innit ?
 Maybe I 'm George Clooney , and you 're Brad Pitt ?
 - No . - I 'm Brad Pitt . You 're George Clooney .
 - I 'm Andy García . If I 'm anyone . - Who 's Andy García ?
 Okay , well , I 'm gonna go while you boys hash that out .
 - Yeah . - I 'll see you both on the other side .
 - Thank you ! Don 't do that . - Yeah !
 Yeah .
 I think that Jackson is Rihanna in
 - Because of the bone structure and eyes .
 - I 've not seen it .
 - No ? - No .
 - Okay . - But fine .
 It was very good .
 - Ugh , this fucking fringe .
 - Aimee , can you please look at the road ?
 - Sorry . - Sorry .
 Right , come on . You and Otis kissed in France .
 What happened ?
 I don 't know . My head 's all over the place at the moment .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 - Things are over with Isaac as well . - Hmm .
 I feel bad about hurting his feelings .
 I 'm sorry , babes .
 Does this mean you and Otis might actually finally get together ?
 I don 't know .
 We 've changed a lot , so I don 't know if it would work out .
 I think you should just bloody go for it , love .
 It 's like Simone de Beauvoir says ,
 " From the hour you 're born , you begin to die . "
 I think it means " live for the day . "
 Yeah .
 Once I realized she wasn 't a lad called Simon , her writing started to make a lot more sense .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ pop music playing over stereo ]
 I shouldn 't have said that stuff about you and Steve .
 I didn 't mean it . I think you 're great together .
 No , you were right . It 's not working out .
 - I 'm sorry .
 - [ car horn honking ]
 - Can you please look at the road ? - Sorry .
 [ exhales ]
 - I love you , love . - I love you , love .
 - [ Aimee ] My concentration 's not great . - It 's all right .
 I 'm sure some of you probably had your reservations about coming here today .
 I don 't think anybody wants to send their child to a school that 's famous for STls and sex musicals .
 [ chuckles ]
 But I 'm here to assure prospective parents that these scandals are a thing of the past .
 And so it is my promise to you that if you should choose Sparkside Academy for your child , that they will receive their education on a safe
 Sex- free camp ... People fuck in the bushes !
 We will protect our youth at all costs .
 Now , let 's hear it from a shining example of Sparkside 's new ethos ,
 Vivienne Odusanya .
 [ cheering ]
 - Here we go .
 - Whoo !
 Come on , Viv !
 Thank you , Hope , for giving me the opportunity to speak today .
 Firstly , I 'd like to invite Jackson Marchetti onstage to reclaim his position as head boy .
 [ audience clapping , cheering ]
 Whoo !
 Thank you , Viv .
 Ah .
 It 's good to be back .
 We agree with Hope that students should feel protected whilst on campus .
 The students of Moordale Secondary would like to share some ideas
 listening to young people could make our new campus the safest place to study in the UK .
 We hope you enjoy .
 What the hell is going on ?
 [ audience cheering ]
 [ screen motor whirring ]
 - [ Otis ] It 's a very slow screen . - It is a slow screen .
 [ whirring stops ]
 And here we go .

 [ Jackson ]

 [ Vivienne ]

 How did you let this happen ?
 - I 'm going to stop the video . - Do it quickly . Don 't make a scene .

 - [ audience laughing ]
 [ Ruby ]
 Stop the video now !
 [ Anwar ]
 - That 's not gonna do anything .
 There 's nothing to see here .
 - Get out of my way ! - Eric !

 [ audience groaning ]
 [ Ruby ] Drop the plug .
 - [ Eric ] What ? - [ Otis ]
 Ruby ?
 - I said , drop it ! Ah !
 - [ grunts ]
 - [ Otis ] Ruby .
 Miss ! - [ Eric ] Miss !
 [ grunts ]
 - Oh my ... Is that ? - That 's a burn .
 Ow ! What are you doing ?
 [ Eric ] Yes , yes .
 Oh my God ! Wow !
 Ruby !
 [ video continues playing ]
 Right .
 - [ Eric ]
 Ru ...
 Ruby !
 - [ Ruby exclaiming ]
 [ Eric ] You cannot do that ! You mustn 't do that !
 [ audience groans ]
 [ screaming ]
 - [ Otis ]
 Ow !
 - [ Eric ] Oh God ! Jeez !
 [ Hope groans ]
 [ video continues playing ]

 That is very expensive perfume .
 - You 're incredible ! - I know .
 [ Connor ]

 What have you done ?
 [ sighs ] [ girl ]

 - [ Otis sighs ] - Now , was that Fleurs du Mal ?
 [ girls moaning ]
 - [ girl 2 ] Come on ! Come on !
 - [ Cal ]
 What the fuck ?
 - Oh , this school ... - [ girl 2 moaning ]



 [ Jackson ]

 [ audience applause , cheering ]
 [ audience chanting ] We are Sex School !
 - We are Sex School ! We are Sex School ! - [ breathes deeply ]
 We are Sex School ! We are Sex School !
 We are Sex School ! We are Sex School !
 We are Sex School ! We are Sex School !
 - We are Sex School ! - What ?
 We are Sex School ! We are Sex School ! We are Sex School !
 We are Sex School !
 We are Sex School !
 We are Sex School ! We are Sex School !
 Thank you ! Thank you all for listening .
 And now the choir will sing us out with our beautiful new school anthem .
 [ audience cheering ]










 Yeah ! Vulva cupcakes !
 - Fuck yeah !
 - I wanna hear ya ! -
 - What are we gonna do ?
 - That 's right .
 - Whoo !

 - [ music stops ]
 - [ all gasp ]
 Fuck !
 What ?
 [ audience murmuring ]
 Hey , Hope .
 [ audience screaming , cheering ]

 [ cheering ]

 - [ cheering continues ]
 - [ Colin ]
 Yeah ! You know it !
 Those are my kids !
 You 're my kids !
 Come on , Moordale !
 [ cheering echoing ]
 [ woman ] What 's wrong with schools teaching abstinence ?
 Well , schools that teach abstinence actually have a higher rate of teen pregnancies and STls than schools with comprehensive SRE programs .
 And when we give teens


 Let 's go live there now to our reporter on the ground .
 [ female reporter ] has evolved into something quite the opposite .




 Otis ?
 - Oh .
 - Ooh . Ow .
 [ groans ]
 These people will know . I can sense it .
 [ Maeve ] Okay .
 Hi !
 Have you seen a woman with blonde hair and green eyes ?
 Kinda looks like her , only older .
 - Oh .
 Thank you . - Okay . Thank you .
 [ phone ringing ]
 Maybe this was a stupid idea .
 She used to bring us here as kids all the time , usually when she was feeling guilty about something .
 At least you 've tried .
 [ Erin laughing ]
 [ indistinct chattering ] [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ Maeve ] Hi , Mum . Hi , Elsie !
 - [ Erin ] What you doing here ? - Should ask you the same .
 - Mummy 's taking me on a boat . - Fuck !
 Come on !
 - [ Eric ] This is amazing .
 - [ Otis ]
 Mm .
 You know this started with you , right ?
 - What do you mean ? - You and Maeve .
 The clinic thing . Getting everyone to talk about their problems .
 If it wasn 't for that , I don 't think vaginas would be getting drawn on a wall .
 Vulvas .
 You like helping people .
 It 's one of the reasons I love you so much .
 I know you 've been hurt , but I don 't think you should lose this part of yourself .
 It 's a very good part .
 - Thanks , man .
 - Mm- hmm .
 - I 've gotta go , actually .
 - Where ?
 Oh my God ! That clitoris is gorgeous !
 - Shall we get out of here ? - Yeah .
 - Mm- mm- mm .
 - There he is . [ phone ringing ]
 Uh ... [ clears throat ] Hello ?
 [ Peter ]

 No . No , that 's fine .
 Is the new boyfriend coming ?




 - Bye .
 [ growls ]

 - [ Jackson ] I can 't believe we did that ! - [ Cal ]
 Yeah .
 - [ chuckles ]
 I am so proud of you . - Oh , I 'm proud of you too .
 - Come on . I 'm feeling a bit left out here . - What ?
 Oh , I 'll see you guys tomorrow .
 - [ Jackson ] Yeah , see you later . - [ Cal ]
 See you , Viv .
 - [ both ]
 Hey .
 - [ both chuckle ]
 So , you wanna hang out ?
 Yeah .
 Okey dokey , let 's be having you .
 All aboard the Skylark !
 I 'm not due for eight weeks . [ groans ]
 - That 's it , darling .
 - [ sighs ]
 You 're the lady who used to do therapy at the school ?
 Yeah , that 's me .
 My daughter 's at Moordale . She 's going through a bit of a tough time .
 Quite worried about her , to be honest .
 I wish she had someone professional , like you , she could talk to on campus .
 Sorry . That 's the last thing you want to be thinking about .
 Oh , no , it 's good to be thinking about something else .
 [ groans ] Why 's she having a tough time ?
 Keep breathing . Um , well , she 's refusing to go to school .
 She 's always been a bit of an outsider .
 She 's obsessed with aliens and things like that .
 I don 't think people really get her .
 I don 't think I understand her sometimes .
 Well , I 'm sure you 're more alike than you think .
 [ groans ]
 Maybe try and find some common ground , something you can relate to in her world , and see if the conversation starts there .
 Ooh , oh shit ! Okay , blow out the candles with me , darling .
 - [ short , quick breathing ] - I 'll try Jakob again .
 [ Jakob ] It 's funny .
 She 's the one that wanted this meeting , but she 's the one that 's late .
 [ chuckles ]
 You mean , you wouldn 't choose to be here if it weren 't for Jean ?
 No . [ chuckles ]
 Well , perhaps we can use this time to talk specifically about your feelings , Jakob .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 I feel fine .
 You don 't seem fine . You seem angry .
 Well , she 's late .
 Can I ask you about your previous marriage ?
 [ splutters ]
 She ... she passed away .
 Yes , but I wonder , can you tell me a little bit about the relationship before she died ?
 We met young .
 [ sighs ]
 I loved her very much .
 And I think she loved me .
 But it was young love .
 Um , we were both very naive .
 And ... then things changed once we had our children .
 How did it change ?
 [ exhales ]
 She met someone else .
 I think she ... she wanted to leave me .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Then she got sick .
 It was all very confusing .
 Yes , I can imagine it must have been .
 But you stayed with her .
 Yeah . You don 't leave when someone is sick .
 And we made it work ...
 [ sighs ] ... until the end .
 When did you grieve ?
 When she died ,
 I ... broke down into pieces .
 Yes , but when did you grieve for what you lost when your wife had the affair ?
 It must be very hard to trust anyone properly again .
 Especially when you weren 't able to fully process the feelings that you had about your wife 's betrayal .
 Yeah , I have a problem with trust .
 But I want to try .
 [ emotional music continues ]
 [ romantic music playing in background ]
 Mm- mm .
 Too fast ?
 - Yeah , I 'd rather keep it off . - That 's cool .
 I mean on .
 [ chuckles ]
 - Sorry . - It 's fine .
 You really are so beautiful .
 Oh shit , that 's a gendered word .
 Pretend I didn 't say that .
 I 'd also still be into you if you weren 't beautiful ...
 Not that I don 't find you beautiful . I do think men can be beautiful .
 - Like a beautiful soul . Know what I mean ? - Jackson .
 [ chuckles ]
 Don 't worry about it . [ chuckles ]
 - Okay .
 - Mm .
 I really didn 't mean what I said .
 I 'm sorry .
 No , it 's ... it 's fine . It 's okay .
 Okay .
 I just feel like I fucked up .
 Should we just stop ?
 [ chuckles ]
 Um , yeah . I mean , you seem tense , and now I 'm tense too .
 Yeah .
 - We can try again another time . - Yeah .
 Yeah .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ exhales ]
 If this was going to become more serious , then you would be in a queer relationship .
 Is that okay with you ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I haven 't , like , got a problem with that ...
 Hm .
 ... at all .
 [ Cal chuckles ]
 Um ...
 [ breathes deeply ]
 - I have to go . - What ?
 Just ... I just gotta help my mum out with some stuff .
 - Oh yeah ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah .
 Okay .
 But I 'm ... Yeah , okay .
 - Bye . - Bye .
 [ scoffs ] What the fuck ?
 [ tuts ]
 [ thud ]
 Ugh !
 You don 't wanna do this , Mum . That 's why you called me .
 Don 't tell me what I wanna do .
 Who is that girl who keeps staring at us ?
 She 's freaking me out .
 It 's my best friend , Aimee .
 She gave me a ride here .
 - And what ? Is she undercover , is she ? - No .
 Thanks very much .
 How am I supposed to know ? You 're good at calling the police on me .
 - You have any idea how that fucked me up ?
 - You 've been fucked up about it ?
 - Try having your kid taken off you ! - Mum , I 'm 17 !
 - I should never have had to report you !
 - I know I wasn 't there for you , okay ?
 But it 's different with Elsie . I 'm gonna give her a better life .
 Mum , you can 't stay clean .
 It doesn 't make you a bad person .
 It 's just Elsie needs someone in her life who isn 't using .
 What , like Anna ?
 Can we go and see Anna ?
 Come on , Els , let 's go .
 Did you get onto that thing for smart kids in America ?
 - How 'd you know about that ?
 - That boy Isaac told me about it .
 Yeah , I did , but I can 't afford it .
 [ Elsie ] Mummy , I want to see Anna .
 Do you think Anna loves her ?
 Yeah , I do .
 Hey .
 You 're gonna stay with Maeve .
 - I wanna stay with you , Mummy . - It 's not very nice where I 'm going .
 It rains all the time , and there 's no chips !
 I love you .
 Oh , I love you too , darling .
 [ voice breaking ]
 You go back to Anna 's with Maeve , and I 'll visit .
 - [ Erin sobs ] Okay ? - Okay .
 Oh , I 'm a lucky mummy . Bye- bye , darling . Bye- bye .
 [ sobs ] Please just take her before I change my mind .
 Elsie , come here . Come give me a hug .
 [ Erin crying ]
 [ Elsie ] Bye , Mummy .
 [ emotional music playing ] [ sobs ]
 [ knocking at door ]
 Hey , Lily . It 's Otis .
 Can I come in ?
 We missed you today .
 And the school realized what Hope did to you guys was wrong .
 We all got together to fight for what we wanted Moordale to be like .
 It was kind of amazing .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 It also made me kind of sad ' cause , uh ...
 I 've realized I 've shut myself off recently .
 I stopped believing it was my place to try and help anyone .
 I got hurt last term .
 Badly .
 And I didn 't wanna do the clinic anymore .
 But that doesn 't mean
 I shouldn 't try and be a good friend .
 I saw you after Hope humiliated you .
 I didn 't even ask if you were all right .
 I should 've checked in .
 I 'm ...
 I 'm really sorry I didn 't .
 Ooh !
 [ exhales ]
 Why are you on the floor ?
 Do you want some alien stuff ?
 I 'm throwing it away .
 I 'm okay . Thanks .
 Ola said you guys aren 't speaking .
 We 're kind of fighting .
 I think she 's going through a tough time too .
 She 's really missing her mum .
 Maybe I 've been a bit distracted , but I 'm not ready to talk to her yet .
 I didn 't think we were friends .
 Well , I ...
 I know we don 't hang out much , but I think we like each other .
 Meh , you 're all right .
 I know what you mean about shutting off .
 I do that , too , when I 'm hurt or I feel like I don 't fit in .
 What do you do when you shut off ?
 Hm .
 Think about my stories .
 About alien planets and galaxies .
 I used to do it all the time when I was a kid , but ...
 I guess it 's just weird now that I 'm getting older .
 It 's really common for people to create rich fantasy worlds to escape into .
 It 's what most artists do .
 They are brave enough to show the weirdest , most vulnerable sides of themselves in their work .
 Which helps a lot of people not feel as alone .
 Thanks , Otis .
 But I don 't think I 'm an artist .
 I wouldn 't be so sure .
 And even if you do decide to not write about aliens anymore , you shouldn 't ever give someone the power to humiliate you .
 You 're great .
 Just the way you are .

 [ Eric laughing ]
 I don 't know if she 's gonna be ready for the competition .
 - It 's probably dumb . - Adam !
 It 's so great you 've entered at all .
 Your mum will be so proud .
 Hm .
 Well , I 've not invited my mum .
 So you only invited me ?
 Yeah . You 're the only one I want there .
 I 've been thinking that maybe we could try going out together .
 [ inhales ]
 Maybe somewhere a bit more gay ?
 [ clicks tongue ]
 Like a ... like a gay bar ?
 [ laughs ] Yeah .
 Or like , um , a club or something .
 [ Adam ]
 Mm .
 We could get dressed up . Could be fun .
 Mm .
 Uh ...
 I don 't think that would be my thing .
 - You like it when I put makeup on you . - Yeah , when we 're in my room .
 I don 't know if I 'm ready to do that with ... in front of people .
 I like it when it 's just you and me .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ pensive music playing ]
 I have to tell you something .
 I kissed someone else .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 In Nigeria .
 You what ?
 [ exhales ]
 It just happened . I 'm so sorry , Adam .
 I need to go and feed Madam , so ...
 [ sniffles , groans ]
 Madam ?
 [ clears throat ]
 [ Jean grunts in labor ]
 - [ grunts ] - [ Lily 's mother ]
 Amazing !
 You 're nearly there , Jean .
 Where the fuck is Jakob ?
 Keep breathing , Jean . You 're doing amazingly .
 - [ grunting ] - Amazing !
 [ Lily 's mother ] That 's it .
 That 's it .
 - [ door opens ]
 - [ grunts ]
 - [ Jean breathing heavily ] - [ Lily 's mother ]
 Brilliant .
 Why are there so many people ?
 When babies are a little early , they always like to have us all here .
 [ Peter ]
 I said , " I 'm injured in three places , " and the doctor says , " Well , don 't go there . "
 [ laughing ]
 [ phone chimes ]
 Ah , bummer !
 - Maureen says she can 't make it . - Aw .
 This salad 's delicious . Did you make it , Peter ?
 [ laughing ]
 No , I don 't have the time , unfortunately , to cook .
 That 's why God gave us caterers !
 [ laughter ]
 [ woman ] Very good .
 I made that one , actually .
 [ woman 2 ]
 Oh .
 Where 'd you get the recipe ?
 - I saw it on a television program .
 - Mm .
 But I added the feta and the parsley .
 I love a man who can cook .
 [ Peter ] I don 't think making a salad is exactly cooking , is it ?
 Putting a lot of leaves in a bowl .
 But wait till you taste the chocolate and beetroot cake for dessert .
 It 's to fucking die for and gluten- free .
 - Guilt- free .
 Huh ?
 - Mm .
 There is something sweet in there .
 I put honey in the dressing , and there 's also pomegranate seeds and ...
 Pomegran ... [ laughing ]
 Could somebody here give my little brother a job ?
 - He 's got too much time on his hands .
 - [ woman 3 laughs ]
 [ silverware clattering ]
 What you doing ?
 I 'm leaving .
 Why ? The grown- ups are in the middle of dinner .
 Because I can 't bear to waste another precious second of my life pretending to like you .
 You 're awful .
 Oh , that 's a wee bit dramatic , don 't you think , Michaela ?
 My name is Michael !
 And my life is a failure .
 My wife 's left , I 'm quite sure my son hates me , and I 'm unemployed .
 But I 'd rather all those things than be a pumped- up shit of a man like you .
 You 've been a shit since you were a child . I think you 'll be a shit until you die .
 Probably because our dad was the biggest shit of all .
 And you learned to bully me so he wouldn 't bully you .
 [ sighs ]
 And that is such a great shame .
 But I am too old for it to be my problem anymore .
 Goodbye , Peter .
 He , uh ... He 's ...
 I like this bowl .
 [ upbeat music playing ]
 [ sighs ]
 Hi . I got your messages . Where is she ?
 She 's in there .
 [ grunting ]
 [ Lily 's mother ] That 's it , darling .
 I need you to give me one last big push , Jean .
 - [ groans , grunts ] - [ Jakob ] Come on .
 Come on .
 Come on .
 [ screaming ]
 That 's it . You 've done it !
 - [ baby crying ]
 - [ panting ]
 - It 's a little girl !
 - [ Jean groans ]
 I 'm so sorry I was late .
 It 's a girl .
 - You did it !
 You did it !
 - [ baby crying ]
 She 's so tiny .
 So tiny .
 - You did so good .
 - [ breathes deeply ]
 - I feel strange . - What ?
 Something 's wrong .
 What ? Something 's wrong .
 [ monitor beeping rapidly ]
 What 's happening here ? What 's happening ?
 Can you please step outside ?
 [ tense music playing ]
 Thank you so much , Maeve .
 Come here .
 Will you stay again tonight ?
 You 've had a really shitty day .
 Yeah , that would be nice .
 I 'm just gonna say goodbye to my friend .
 Okay .
 Maeve , I know you don 't like emotional shit , but I 've been thinking about how you don 't really have a proper mum , and I wanted you to know that even though my mum has money , she 's also crap sometimes too .

 So I was thinking that maybe we could be each other 's mums .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Thanks , Mum .
 You 're welcome , Mum .
 [ knocking at door ]
 - Hi , Maureen .
 - Hi .
 I made a salad . I thought you and Adam might like it .
 Actually , that 's not true . I just wanted to see you .
 And I just wanted to say that I know I was hard to live with , that I 'm rigid , and I 'm uptight .
 I don 't know how to be spontaneous or anything close to happy .
 But I do want to change .
 I want to try to be the man that you want .
 Do you think we could talk ?
 I don 't want to talk .
 [ upbeat music playing ]

 - [ phone chimes ]

 [ pants ]
 Hi . Oh , it 's me again .
 Is Maeve here ?
 Yeah . Yeah , she 's in the back garden .
 [ lighter clicking ]
 Hey .
 Hi ! What are you doing here ?
 I , uh , I needed to talk to you .
 What 's ... what 's going on ?
 It was never about the clinic .
 I did the clinic to be close to you .
 And then you made me realize I 'm good at something , and I like helping people .
 And I thought you ignored my message , and it crushed my heart .
 I stopped doing the clinic because it reminded me of you .
 It sucked .
 ' Cause I wanna help people .
 I know this is only about money for you , but let 's just be a team again , please ?
 If I can 't be with you romantically , I still wanna see you every day .
 [ rain pattering ]
 Nothing feels right when you 're not around .
 It wasn 't just about the money for me .
 [ exhales ]
 I wanted to be close to you too .
 ... [ phone ringing ]
 ... [ thunder rumbling ]

 [ song fades ]
