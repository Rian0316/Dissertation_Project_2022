 Oh , come on !
 Hey , it 's your Thanksgiving too .
 You know , instead of watching football , you could help . We know .
 Hey , Rachel , you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles .
 No , Mon , you want to put them in concentric circles .
 I want to do this .

 Every year .
 The One With the Football

 To the ten , to the five . Touchdown , Giants !
 You know , for once I am gonna sit down and try to watch one of these things .
 Halftime .
 Who wants to throw the ball around ?
 - Get a little three- on- three going ?
 - That would be so much fun . - Can I play too ?
 - I 've never played football , like , ever .
 Great ! You can cover Chandler .
 No , no .
 I don 't really want to play . You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up .
 That 's not true .
 I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day .
 I wanted to start drinking in the morning . Don 't say I don 't have goals !
 Chandler , you have to start getting over her , all right ? If you play , you get some fresh air .
 Maybe it 'll take your mind off Janice .
 If you don 't play , everyone will be mad at you because the teams won 't be even .
 - Come on .
 - All right , I 'll play .
 But I don 't like you .
 - Let 's do it ! Ross ? - What ?
 Wanna play football ?
 Monica and I aren 't supposed to play football .
 Says who ?
 Your mom ? - Yeah .
 - Yes . " What do you mean ? "
 She asks her boyfriend ... ... really scared to hear the answer .
 Every Thanksgiving , we used to have a touch football game ... ... called the Geller Bowl .
 No , no , no .
 You say that proudly !
 Anyway , Ross and I were always captains .
 It got kind of competitive , and one year , Geller Bowl Vl ... ... I accidentally broke Ross ' nose .
 It was so not an accident .
 She saw I was about to tag her , so she threw ... ... her big fat grandma- arm elbow in my face ... ... and just kept running .
 To score the winning touchdown , by the way . You did not win the game .
 The touchdown didn 't count ... ... because of the spectacularly illegal , and savage , nose- breaking .
 I won the game .
 Oh , yeah ?
 Then how come you didn 't get the Geller Cup ? There was a Geller Cup ?
 Yes , it was the trophy you got if you won the game .
 But our dad said nobody won that game , and he was sick of our fighting .
 So he took the trophy ...

 ... threw it in the lake .
 And was the curse lifted ?

 Anyway ... ... that 's why Mom said we were not allowed to play football again .
 You know what ?
 I think we should play a game .
 I mean , come on .
 It 's been 12 years .
 Can I see you for a second ?


 - Wuss !
 - All right , we 're gonna play . Wait . How are we gonna get there ?
 Because my mom won 't let me cross the street .


 Pheebs , here you go .
 - Okay , let 's bring it in . - Wait .
 Honey , throw it to me ! Here you go .
 That almost hit me in the face !
 All right , we have to pick captains .
 And then Tennilles .
 Okay , so how do we decide that ?
 - Well , why don 't we just bunny up ?
 - What ?
 - Bunny !
 - Bunny !
 Okay , looks like Ross and I are captains .
 There must be a place in heaven for people who hung out with you in high school .
 Okay . So I bunnied first , which means I get to pick first .
 Joey .
 - Thank you . - Monica ! I 'm your best friend .
 Sweetie , don 't worry , you 'll get picked .
 Chandler .
 - Ross ! - Phoebe .

 Sweetie , now I pick you .
 You don 't pick me . You 're stuck with me !
 Okay . All right . So let 's see .
 Let 's play from the trash can to the light post , right ?
 Two- hand touch . We 'll kick off .
 All right , people , listen . I 've got exactly 28 minutes ... ... before I have to baste again .
 Wow , just like in the pros .
 Come on . Huddle up ! - All right , huddle up right over here !
 - Wait for me !
 Wait for me !
 Oh , cool !
 This is my first huddle . - Okay .
 - Okay . So what do you guys really think of Chandler ?
 - You know what you 're doing , right ?
 - Yeah . Joey 's going to catch it .
 - And you and I are going to block .
 - What 's block ?
 - I thought you knew what you were doing .
 - I thought you meant in life .
 Break !
 The ball is Janice .
 The ball is Janice .


 Son of a ... ! - Come on !
 - Sorry .
 I 'm sorry . You know what ?
 We 're just gonna throw it .
 I got it !
 Go , go , go !

 Score !
 Seven to nothing ! Okay , honey , just so that I 'm clear on this .
 You said in the huddle that if Joey caught the ball , you 'd be the one to stop him .
 Now , you didn 't .
 So is that like a football strategy ?
 Yeah , it was part of my plan to fall instantly behind .
 So ... Come on . Let 's go .
 Losers walk . Yeah ?
 Losers talk .
 No . No . No .
 Actually , losers rhyme .
 Forty- three .
 Seventy- four .
 - You wanna go shotgun ?
 - Yeah .
 - Hike . - One Mississippi , two Mississippi ...
 Over here ! Over here !
 I almost caught that one !
 Great .
 Now the score 's 7 to almost 7 .
 Okay .
 On this play , I want you to do a down- and- out to the right , okay ? - Break !
 - Wait . What am I gonna do ?
 You ? You go long . Well , how long ?
 - Until we start to look very small . - Okay . Break !
 - Hike .
 - One Mississippi , two Mississippi ... Switch !
 Switch ! Switch !



 Hey .
 Thanks for stopping our ball . You are playing American football ?
 Yeah . Wow ! You 're , like , from a whole other country !
 I 'm Dutch . Hi , I 'm Joey .
 I am Margha .
 I 'm sorry , Dutch . I didn 't get that last little bit .
 Hey , Joey , you wanna play football or ...
 Hi , I 'm Chandler . Hello , Chandler .
 Her name is Dutch and also Margha . Margha .
 - Margha . - Margha . Mar- hon .
 Margha .
 Yo , flirty boys .
 We 're in the middle of a game .
 Come on , guys ! Let 's go ! Come on .
 Second down ! - Hello ? It 's third down .
 - No , it 's not . It 's second . - Wow .
 - Wow what ?
 How it just amazes me that you 're still pulling stuff like this .
 - Pulling what ? It 's second down . - Okay , it 's second down .
 Take all the second downs you need .
 - I heard that . - Well , I said it loud .
 It is okay if I stay and watch ? I can 't go home just yet .
 My roommate is forshlocking a big American businessman .
 - Just sit right there . - Yeah , why don 't you stick around ?
 - Well , that went well . - I think so .
 You know , I was thinking about asking her for her number .
 Thanks , man , but it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself , you know ?
 No .
 I was thinking about for me .
 As part of that whole getting- over- Janice thing you talked about .
 Oh , yeah .
 That .
 If it means that much , I 'll let you have her .
 Thanks . Let me have her ?
 What do you mean ? If you didn 't , I wouldn 't have a shot ?
 I don 't like to say it out loud ... ... but yeah !
 Don 't feel bad , man . We all have our strengths .
 - You 're better with numbers and stuff .
 - Math ? You 're giving me math ?
 All right , you know what ?
 Forget about it .
 You go for the girl . We 'll see who gets her .

 Chandler , I want you to run a post- pattern to the left .
 And , sweetie ... Yeah , I know . Go long .
 You know , it 's like all I 'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle .
 Well , you wanna just stay out there ?
 Can I see that for a second ?
 - Okay .
 - Okay , let 's go . - I got Chandler !
 - Hike ! One Mississippi , two Mississippi , three Mississippi .
 Fumble !
 What the hell 's the matter with you ?
 This is my favorite jersey .
 Well , now you have two .
 Hey , I am good at math ! That 's it .
 I was still gonna let you have her .
 But now forget about it . Prepare to feel bad about yourself .
 Hey , well , I 've been preparing for that my entire life ! Or something about you that 's mean !
 All right . Come on , guys .
 Let 's go . Tie score .
 We 're running out of time . Forty- two , 38 , hike ! I got it !
 Oh , broken boobs !
 - Pheebs , run !
 - Run , Phoebe , run !
 Touchdown ! Touchdown !
 Hello , the buzzer buzzed . It doesn 't count . - After the snap .
 - Before the snap . - After . - Before .
 - Now , does it really matter ?
 - Yes !
 But I made a touchdown .
 It was my first touchdown .
 Pheebs , that 's great . Doesn 't count .
 - Does so count . - Cheater , cheater , compulsive eater .

 Oh , my God !
 You know what ? That 's fine . Maybe you haven 't grown up , but I have .
 - Oh , okay . - Dead leg !
 Okay , fine .
 You want to win by cheating , go ahead , all right . Phoebe , the touchdown does count . You win .
 No !
 I 'm not going to go through this again .
 I wanna beat you when you can 't blame ... ... it on the broken nose or the buzzer or the fact that you might have mono .
 All right .
 Let 's just call this tie score and it 's halftime .
 First , I don 't play with cheaters . And second of all , you know I had swollen glands !
 You know what ? I think you 'll play . Oh , really ?
 Why 's that ? Because the winner gets this .
 The Geller Cup !
 Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two- by- four ?
 Okay , good .
 Okay , where the hell did you get that ?
 When you went to the hospital for your nose ... ... I swam into the lake and fished it out .
 That cup is mine !
 No , it 's not .
 You want it , you 're gonna have to win it .
 All right .
 So are we not having dinner at all ?
 Hey , could you please set the timer , Margha ?
 Okay , Beefy .
 Come on , Phoebe , let 's go .
 Come on , it 's time to get serious .
 Huddle up .
 Joey , keep your head in the game .
 It 's hard , you know ?
 His huddle 's close to the Dutch girl . Look , if I take Chandler out of the running , will you be able to focus ?
 - What are you gonna do ? - Just make sure he catches the ball . - I 'll do the rest .
 - Okay .
 - Come on , you wuss ! - Okay , come on .
 - Go , Chan ... - I got it !
 Come on ! This way ! Hi !
 Look out !
 Tackled by a girl !
 Bet you don 't see that every day , do you ?
 What 's with the tackling ?
 What ? I just touched him and he went over .
 Okay .
 You wanna play rough ? We can play rough .
 Let 's get ready to rumble !













 - Go , go , go !
 - Get her !
 Get her !
 I love this game !
 Hey , where 'd you get that ?
 I went really long .
 Forty- two to 21 .
 Like the turkey , Ross is done !
 No surprise .
 You got to pick first , so you got the better team . You 're pathetic !
 Why can 't you just accept that we 're winning ... ... because I 'm better than you ?
 Oh , what a great argument .
 Exhaling !
 You know what ? I 'll prove it to you . I 'll trade you Joey for Rachel and I 'll still win the game .

 Oh , that 's great . There goes my last shred of self- esteem .
 What ?
 The guys against the girls ?
 See that 's ridiculous , Monica , because I 'm only down by three touchdowns .
 Oh , then bring it on ! Unless , of course , you 're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls .
 Fine .
 Fine .
 Rachel , you 're with Monica . Joey , you 're with me .
 I cannot believe you are trading me . You are going to lose .
 And you are going to lose .
 And ... Help me out . I 've never done this before .
 That 's good .
 Lose . Lose !
 Come on . Let 's see what it 's like to be on a winning team for a change .
 You 're gonna let me play ? All right , then ! The game is over ?
 We eat now ?
 The game 's not over . We 're switching teams .
 Yeah . Chandler finds me so intimidating that it 's better if we 're on the same team .
 All right .
 Okay , let 's play . Let 's go . Hold on a second , Joe .

 Where do Dutch people come from ?


 Well , the Pennsylvania Dutch come from Pennsylvania .
 And the other Dutch people ?
 They come from somewhere near the Netherlands , right ?
 Nice try .
 See the Netherlands is this make- believe place ... ... where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from . Oh , my .
 Enough with geography for the insane , okay .
 Let 's play some ball . - No .
 I 'm not playing with this guy now . - Fine with me .
 Okay , I 've had enough of this . Let 's just cut to the chase . Heidi , which of my boys do you like ?
 What are you doing ? What are you doing ?
 Which do I like ?
 Yeah , for dating , general merriment , taking back to your windmill ?
 Well , if I had to choose right now ... ... which , by the way , I find really weird ... ... I would have to say Chandler .
 Yes !
 Wait a minute .
 She obviously didn 't understand the question .
 Well , why don 't you have Captain Hook explain it to her ?
 I 'm sorry , Joey .
 That is my truth .
 You hear that ?
 That is her truth , Mr. I 'll- Let- You- Have- Her !
 I win !
 You suck !
 I rule all !
 Mini- wave in celebration of me !
 I am now thinking I would like to change my answer to no one .
 What ?
 I now find you shallow ... ... and a dork .
 Bye- bye . Nice going .
 You just saved yourself a couple months of sex .
 You know what ?
 It doesn 't matter , because she picked me .
 Me ! Now I get the dates ... ... and you stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready , Set , Cook !


 Save the breakthroughs for therapy .
 The clock is ticking .
 We have no time and we are losing to girls . We 're not gonna lose to girls . It 's 42 to 21 !
 This sucks !
 I was just up by that much !
 Look , let me put it this way .
 If we lose , they will never let us forget it . Okay , and worse than that , they 'll never let the women you date forget it .
 Hey ! Are we playing football , or what ?
 Come on , you hairy- backed Marys !
 We have to do this .
 We are playing for women everywhere .
 Okay , just think about every lousy date you ever had . Every guy who kept one eye on the TV while you were making out .
 Oh , my God !
 You dated someone with a glass eye too ? Come on , okay ?

 This is for all womankind .
 Let 's kill them ! Yeah !
 Kill them !
 All right , well , I want to kill them too .
 But they 're boys .
 You know , how are we gonna beat three boys ?
 We still have a minute and a half left , and we 're down by two points .
 Two points , ladies .

 Phoebe , you do a buttonhook again . Rachel , you go long . No , don 't make me go long .
 Use me . They never cover me .
 Honey , there 's a reason . Monica , I 'm not lame , okay ?
 I can do something .
 I can throw . - Let me throw .
 This is my game too . - Come on , Mon . Let her throw the ball .
 Rachel , sweep behind , I 'll pitch it to you .
 You throw it downfield to Phoebe .
 Thank you .
 - Break !
 - Break !
 - All right , here we go . - Okay .
 Thirty- two , 71 , hike !
 One Mississippi , two Mississippi , three Mississippi !


 Go , go , go !
 Mon , catch ! - I 'm so sorry . Are you okay ?
 - No , I 'm not okay !
 I 'm sorry .
 They were coming at me and I didn 't know what to do .
 Thirty seconds left on the timer .
 You are the loser !
 Okay , okay .
 So we get to take that stupid troll thing home . Come on ! Come on !
 Hurry ! We 're running out of time .
 - Huddle up !
 - Okay .
 Oh , this is our last huddle !
 All right , Phoebe , get open .
 Rachel ... ... go long . Okay .
 Break !




 I did it !
 Touchdown !
 We did it !
 You know ?
 Rachel , funny thing , actually .
 The end zone starts at that pole .
 So you 're 5 feet short .
 So ... ... we win !
 Yes , yes , yes !
 Wait , so explain something to me , though .
 If nobody tagged Rachel , then isn 't the play still going ?
 - Let me in , let me in !
 - No way !
 Let go !
 Let go ? !
 I 'm a tiny little woman !
 Guys , guys , come on .
 It 's Thanksgiving !
 It 's not important who wins or loses .
 The important thing is , the Dutch girl picked me !
 Me , not you !
 Holland loves Chandler !
 Thank you , Amsterdam !
 Good night !
 We should definitely play football more often .
 Maybe there 's , like , a league we could join or something .
 Isn 't there , like , a national football league ?
 Yes .
 Yes , there is .
 They play on Sundays and Monday nights .
 Oh , shoot !
 I work Monday nights .
 This stuffing is amazing .
 - Should we should bring them some ?
 - When they 're hungry , they 'll come in .
 - Let go !
 - No , you let go !
 How come it 's always us left on the field , holding the ball ?
 I don 't know .
 I guess the other people just don 't care enough .
 Hey , it 's starting to snow .
 - Give it to me !
 Let go !
 - Let it go !
 Come on !
 There was a time tonight that I started losing the feeling in my toes .
 - I know .
 - That 's when I realized ... ... there 's more important things than beating you at football .
 Things like feet .
 Yeah , I know .
 This thing has caused us too much pain and suffering .
 - Yeah .
 - It 's time .
 We 'll just call it a tie .
 - It 's a tie .
 - All right .
 Here .
 Okay .
 - Good night .
 - Good night .
 Pheebs , did you get it ?
 - Yeah , I got it .
 - Oh , great .
 Bring it up .
 There 's champagne in my apartment for the winners .
 - Ross !
 What are you doing down here ?
 - Nothing .
