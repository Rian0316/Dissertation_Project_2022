 Okay , it 's done .
 Look , guys , for the future ,
 I don 't mind killing the big spiders , But you have to at least try with the little ones .
 Penny , please .
 We 're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids .
 Sheldon , it 's not so bad .
 Not bad ? it 's horrible . I mean , you hear stories about this sort of thing , ?
 But you never think it 'll happen to you . So they steamed your dumplings . Get over it .
 New topic , please .
 All right , penny . ? Let me take this opportunity to point out
 That you are looking particularly ravishing today .
 Not with a thousand condoms , howard .
 So , there is a number .
 Okay , new topic , please .
 5A Hey , did you hear the people upstairs in 5a are moving out ? - ? - - No , shh- shh- shh ! - what ? !
 The people upstairs are moving out . No !
 The horror ...
 Why would you just say something like that ?
 No , no , no , no , no , no , no ...
 How else was I supposed to say it ?
 Slowly . like putting a new fish in a tank .
 You don 't just drop it in . You let the bag sit in the water a while .
 The horror ...
 Sheldon , I 'm sure it 's going to be fine . No , it 's not going to be fine .
 Change is never fine .
 They say it is , but it 's not . ?
 Okay , honey , did you even know the people that are moving out ?
 I never met them . That 's what made them perfect .
 There were no awkward " hellos " in the halls .
 There 's no clickety- clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors . ?
 They may as well have been a family of
 Cats just jumping around from drape to drape . Without that annoying ammonia urine smell .
 Well , I 'm sure the new people will be just as quiet .
 You can 't know that . How can you possibly know that ?
 You 're right , I can 't . you know what ?
 Anyone could rent that apartment now . an opera singer , the cast of stomp ...
 Yeah , a tap- dancing pirate with a wooden leg .
 Why are you making it worse ?
 I tried making it better . he wouldn 't go for it .
 You 're right ! that 's a great idea .
 - What ?
 - I 'll take the apartment upstairs . I can finally get away from my mother
 And we can all spend some more time together .
 If you catch my drift .
 The horror ...



 Hold on .
 You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we
 Break our backs helplping wolowitz move , and then he only need buy us a pizza ?
 I 'm sorry , that really is how it works .
 You ' tricking me .
 You tell me the truth , what do we get ?
 Raj , help me out here .
 PS3 [ ] You get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps3 .
 I knew it ! PS3 PS3 Ps3 , definitely ps3 .
 Who would pick a mountain bike ?

 ? Enough with the guilt , ma .
 We 'll still see each other .
 I 'll come over every night and have dinner with you .
 The hell you will !
 What am I running here , a fancy restaurant ?
 Does this look like olive garden ? !
 Okay , I get it , you 're angry .
 You don 't want to see your little bird leave the nest .
 " little bird " ? 30 ? You 're almost 30 !
 Fly , for god 's sake ! ?
 Fine , I 'll stay ! Ya happy , crazy lady ?
 I sure as hell hope so , because you 're ruining my life !
 Hey , penny ? it 's leonard . ?
 Good news , you can take your head out of the oven .

 I guess I won 't be needing this .

 Oh , no ...
 The new ones .
 They 're here .
 Stay calm . we don 't know anything about them yet .
 What are you doing ?
 I 'm checking for musical instruments .
 Does that sound like castanets to you ?
 The box says " kitchen . "
 So ? do cocaine smugglers write " cocaine " on the box ?
 Hello ? - - Hello . hello . - - - Hello . hello . hello .
 I 'm Alicia .
 I 'm moving in upstairs .
 That is so great . Oh , I 'm leonard .
 I live downstairs .
 Upstairs from here , but under you .
 Not under you per se , but under your apartment .
 That 's nice . Yeah , it is .
 If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate ...
 Hello .
 Hello .
 Hello .
 On a scale of one to ten
 How light of foot would you describe yourself With one being not cat- like at al
 And ten being freakishly feline ? " freakishly feline " ? Is that your answer or do you not understand the question ?
 We 'll come back to that one .
 Sheldon ... Hang on .
 Are you now or have you ever been a salsa
 Irish folk or break- dancer ? ? No . You 're making her uncomfortable .
 Oh , I 'm sorry .
 Well , if it helps you feel any better you 're doing very well so far . Next question, are you fertile ?
 What ? ! ? I 'm trying to determine whether crying
 Infants above my head are a possibility .
 I have no immediate plans . If that changes , let me know .
 And finally , area rugs , pro or con ? - - Pro ? alicia ? - - Yes ? welcome to the building .



 Thanks so much for helping me , leonard . ?
 Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help .
 Oh , hey , guys .
 Hey , penny . this is alicia , our new neighbor .
 Hi . Hi .
 I 'm helping .
 I can see . ?
 Alicia 's non- musical , childless and pro- rug .
 She 's still on probation , of course , but I like her .
 T Cool t- shirt . Oh , yeah , I don 't usually dress like this .
 I 'm going jogging .
 You don 't jog . I can start . ? True
 But the more likely explanation for your Attire is that you 're out of clean clothes again .
 Thank you , sheldon . You 're welcome , penny .
 Please , you look cute . ? I 'm dressed like a slob today , too .
 I think you look fantastic .
 This one 's a player , huh ? Oh , yeah , be careful .
 Thanks for the warning . okay . - - - I 'll see you around . - see ya .

 ?
 I 'm dressed like a slob today , too .
 Oh , mimicry . I enjoy mimicry .
 I 've been working on admiral ackbar from return of the jedi .
 " " it 's a trap . "
 You have to imagine me with a giant squid head .

 " " it 's a trap . "

 " " it 's a trap . "
 " " it 's a trap . "

 Come .
 Congratulations , I see you did your laundry . - - - Well , sort of . - how does one " sort of ... "
 I bought new clothes , okay ? Is leonard around ?
 He 's upstairs at Alicia 's . ? Oh . all right , that 's cool , no biggie . ?

 He said he 'd help me set up my printer , but I guess I can wait . ?
 What exactly is he doing up there ?
 In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me ,
 He is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo .
 Oh , they 're all up there , huh ? Hmm , typical .
 It 's axiomatically atypical .
 Up until recently , they did not know alicia , And had no encounters with her in a previous location .
 They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants , So your characterization of their behavior as " typical "
 Is demonstrably fallacious .
 Okay , now I see the giant squid head .

 Oh , great ! now , I have to start all over again .
 Yeah , I thought about renting this apartment ,
 But I 'm really more of a " downtown loft " kind of guy .
 Cool . so are you in a loft now ? Oh , actually ,
 I 'm , uh , living with a woman in altadena .
 Purely platonic . she 's also my maid . Sounds like a sweet deal .
 I won 't lie . it 's pretty dope .

 Hello ?
 Hey , I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift .
 That is so sweet . Come on in . let 's open it . great .
 Nice dress . ? Oh , this ?
 I 'm dressed like a slob today .
 The guys have been helping me set up my sound system .
 I 've never had such good- looking technical support .
 Oh , pish- posh .
 I don 't know , it means shucks . " shucks " means shucks . ?
 Let one go once in a while .
 - ? - - Hey , uh , penny , you want to hear something awesome ? - Yeah .
 Alicia is an actress , just like you .
 That is so awesome .
 Well , trying to be , but it 's so hard . Yeah , I know , tell me about it .
 I 've been out here three months , And all I 've gotten is a couple of national commercials
 And this recurring thing on a soap .
 That 's why I work at the cheesecake factory .
 I 'm holding out for the right part .

 ? DVD Alicia , what do you want as your default setting for dvds 5 . 1 5 . 1 dolby or dts ? Whatever you think is best , cutie .
 ...
 Well , dts has more low end , so ...
 Okay . ?
 Uh , hey , guys , guys , you will really appreciate this .
 I read the best science joke on the internet . Alicia , you won 't get it , but it 's right up their alley .
 Anyway , so ,
 This physicist goes into an ice cream parlor every week and orders an ice
 Cream sundae for himself , and then offers one ? To the empty stool sitting next to him .
 This goes on for a while
 Until the owner finally asks him what he 's doing .
 The man says , " well , I 'm a physicist , and quantum mechanics ...
 Teaches us " that it is possible For the matter above this stool " to
 Spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman MM Who might accept my offer and fall in love with me . "
 The owner then says , " well , lots of single , MM " beautiful women come in here ever day . " why don 't you buy an ice cream for one of them ,
 And they might fall in love with you ? "
 And the physicist says , " yeah , but what ? are the odds of that happening ? "

 It 's a little insulting , don 't you think ?
 How would I know ?
 I 'm not even sure I get it .
 Hey , leonard ?
 DVD If you 're done with the dvd player , can you set up my printer ?
 Uh , yeah , I 'd love to . Uh , hey , maybe when you 're done with her printer ,
 You could set up mine . ...
 You know , like you promised ... a week ago . Yeah , I 'll get to it -- don 't nag me .

 Hello there

 Who is it ?
 Oh hello , penny .
 It 's open -- come in .
 Sarcasm . Well , they 're all still up there .
 You think I can 't hear them ? Listen to that .
 Stomp , stomp , stomp .
 That 's wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one .
 I don 't even know why I care .
 I don 't care . All right , I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke ,
 But that 's all I care . You know , penny ,
 There 's something that Occurs in beehives you might find interesting .
 Occasionally , A new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power .
 When this happens , The old queen must either locate to a new hive or ?
 Engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains .
 ? What are you saying , that I 'm threatened by alicia ? That I 'm like the old queen of the hive
 And it 's just time for me to go ? I 'm just talking about bees .
 They 're on the discovery channel .
 What are you talking about ?
 Bees .

 I just got that physicist joke .
 Gee , penny , thanks for buying us dinner .
 Yeah , what 's the occasion ?
 No , no occasion -- just felt like getting some chinese chow for my peeps .
 Did you remember to ask for the chicken
 With broccoli to be diced , - - Not shredded ? Yes . - ? - Even though the menu description specifies shredded ?
 Yes . - - Brown rice , not white ? Yes . - You stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard ?

 Yes . - did you pick up the low- sodium soy sauce from the market ? yes .
 Good .

 See how it 's done , leonard ?

 So , what do we got going on tonight , huh ? Playing halo watching battlestar , drop some mentos in diet coke ?
 You want to watch battlestar ? ?
 What can I say ? I got my geek on , boys .
 ?
 No , no , pms is different .
 - - Oh , thank god you 're home . I need help . what 's wrong ? ? I just got a callback to audition ? <> ?
 For csi to play a hooker who gets killed .
 Oh , I 'd watch that .
 But my car is in the shop ,
 Okay , well , I 'll take you .
 Oh , you 're a lifesaver . I 'll run lines with you in the car . Great .
 And afterward , I 'll take you all out for chinese . ...
 Oh , actually , that 's okay . we already have ... ?
 Yum . starving .

 ... chinese food right here .
 They 're gone , penny .
 They can 't hear you .
 I cannot believe they 're letting her just use them like that .
 I mean , anything she wants , ?
 They go panting after her like trained dogs . You know that just last week , She had howard drive all the way to her
 Uncle 's house in orange county to pick up her tv ? ?
 You once had leonard and me
 Get your television from your ex- boyfriend .
 Apples and oranges here , sheldon .
 That girl is a user ? iceskating through the life on her looks ,
 Weak- willed men , getting auditions for stupid network shows . ?
 It just creams my corn .
 Taking advantage of innocent , ?
 - - !
 May I interject something here ? please . You got the wrong mustard .
 I got the part on csi . ?
 Oh , boy . <> Guess what ?
 Something wrong ? Uh , no . no , no , no , you know , congratulations .
 I think you 'll make a great hooker .
 Thank you .
 Hey , I got to ask you something .
 How much do physicists make ?
 Um , I don 't know .
 I don 't think a lot .
 Yeah , that 's what I figured . Well , got to run .
 The guys promised to set up my satellite dish
 And paint my bedroom . yay ! Um , hey , hey , can I talk to you about that for a second ? About what ?
 Well , you know , it 's just that leonard and howard and raj ,
 They aren 't like other guys .
 They 're special . Okay , they 're special ... and ?
 Oh , let 's see . how can I explain this ?
 Um , they don 't know how to use their shields .
 Shields ? Yeah , you know , like in star trek ,
 When you 're in battle and you raise the shields ?

 Where the hell 'd that come from ?
 ...
 Anyways , um , you know how guys like this are , so ...
 Please don 't take advantage of them . Who says I 'm taking advantage of them ?
 Come on . they 're doing everytng for you ,
 Because you 're leading them on . So I let them do stuff for me .
 They 're happy . I get stuff . Who cares ? ?
 And how 's it any different from what you do ?
 Excuse me ?
 I 've seen you around them . ?
 Are you pretending like you don 't do the exact same thing ?
 Okay , lady , you are way out of line .
 Oh , I 'm out of line ? ? Yeah , you 're out of line .
 Well , what are you going to do about it ... Bitch ?

 I like green lantern .
 I 'm just saying it 's pretty lame that
 He can be defeated by the color yellow .
 Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow . Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood .
 2B Great , so I can take them both out with a number- two pencil ?

 Oh , my god ! girl fight !
 What are you doing ? !
 I know you . you 're stupid enough to break it up .
