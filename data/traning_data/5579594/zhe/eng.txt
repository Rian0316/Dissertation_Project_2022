 Chuck :
 You can move the red five up .
 Man :
 Oh , yeah .
 Thank you , sir .
 Why do the cards have holes in them ?
 Oh .
 They 're , uh -- these are used cards from the casino .
 Once the casino pulls a deck of cards out of action , they drill a hole through them and sell 'em to the public .
 Just a buck or 2 .
 Look at that .
 I suppose that 's to prevent people from cheating with them . Yeah .
 Makes for a good souvenir .
 These are from caesars .
 Mm .
 I 've never been . Hmmm .

 Getting dark .
 I hate to say it , but I think it might be time to kill the lights .
 Oh , yes , sir . Of course .
 You sure I can 't make you a cup of tea ?
 I 'm fine , sir .
 Thank you .
 All right , then .











 Ohh .
 Just what I needed .
 Drink up , guys .
 Don 't need you fallin ' asleep .
 Hey , you take care of that battery ?
 It finally shit the bed , but we swapped it out a couple hours ago .
 Oh , yeah .
 Okay .
 How 'd it go ?
 No problem .
 Anyone see you ?
 Nah .
 Dead over there .
 A 'ight .
 Stay awake .

















 hello ? Jimmy : Oh , hey .
 Come on in .
 Hi . I 'm Francesca liddy . I 'm here for the interview .
 Oh .
 Jimmy mcgill .
 Hey , are you , uh , running early , or am I running late ?
 No , sorry .
 I 'm a little early .
 It 's not a problem .
 Never bad to be early ...
 Except in death and taxes and ... Some other things .
 Hey , can I ask you a question ?
 Sure .
 Does that look straight to you ?
 Uh ...
 I think there -- that -- that side --
 I think you 're a little crooked -- the bottom of the " m " there .

 Yeah .
 A little crooked .

 So , you 're coming off of seven years at the mvd ?
 I am , yeah .
 Here 's a question -- how come new Mexico doesn 't call it the dmv like every other state ?
 Well , that 's a great question .
 Uh , just like in Arizona , the motor vehicles division is part of the dot , a division , whereas , in most other states , the dmv , or department of motor vehicles is its own entity , so ...
 I don 't know if that answers the question , except to say that 's the government for you .
 You got that right .
 Well , I , for one , am not calling it the mvd -- dmv all the way .
 What do you think you learned the most working there ?
 Patience , diplomacy .
 Uh , you meet a- all sorts of people down there , a- and most are really great , really friendly , but you encounter some who are upset , belligerent .
 What about old folks ? Uh , you get your fair share of them ?
 Oh , lots of elderly drivers .
 After 75 , they need to take their test again , so if they don 't pass , you have to explain to them why their license isn 't being renewed , which is hard for them .
 What do you say then ?
 Do you ever ... Yell at them ? I mean , geezers , right ?
 How can you not ?
 No , i would never .
 No . Nor should you . That was a trick question .
 You passed with flying colors -- very good .
 Okay .
 Well , then , so , Jimmy and i have very different needs .
 His practice is mostly wills for senior citizens , while I 'm focused on a single client at the moment , mesa verde , with banking regulations that generate a ton of paperwork , so I 'm looking for someone with an eye for organization and detail .






 Well , dmv 's great for that -- tons of detail in those driver 's licenses .
 Jimmy :
 We did see hundreds of people every day , and you 'd never want to let a mistake slip through on their forms .
 You 'd just have a horrible cascade of problems . Sounds challenging .
 So , why the law ?
 I mean , why leave the dmv -- or mvd ?
 I have to imagine you 'll be giving up a good benefits package .
 Good healthcare and retirement plans , but ...
 There 's a bureaucracy to government work that ultimately became too frustrating .
 I guess what you 'd call it -- too much red tape .
 I just want to be somewhere i can make a difference . Well , that 's us .
 We 're all about making a difference .
 And I see here both word and excel -- you 're comfortable with ?
 Absolutely . Excel word ? Wow .
 Well , you had me at old people . Hey , here 's a question -- can you start today ?
 Can -- yes ?
 I , uh ...
 Fantastic . Now , can you --
 Can you just give us a second , Francesca ?
 Absolutely . I ... Of course .
 Um ... Thank you .
 Uh- huh .

 What are you doing ?
 What ?
 I like her .
 " Can you start today ? "
 Don 't you think we should see some more résumés --
 like , a lot more ?
 She is our first interview .
 We haven 't even checked her references .
 So we 'll check 'em .
 Kim , you 've been takin ' forever searching for a paralegal .
 We need help here .
 I haven 't found the right fit .
 Yeah , 'cause you 're searching for perfection , and perfection is the enemy of perfectly adequate .
 Oh , so that 's the bar here -- adequate ?
 She 's than adequate !
 She worked at the dmv .
 That 's like the fifth circle of hell .
 Look , she 's overqualified .
 I- if it doesn 't work out , we can fire her .
 It 's no big deal .
 Don 't you think someone with some actual legal experience would be better ?
 Look , I 've got a commercial airing in ... 11 minutes , so the phones are gonna be ringin ' off the hook and I need help .
 Can we give her a test run , please ?
 I got a good feeling about this .
 Come on , Kim .


 Now , getting these oldsters to call -- that 's half the battle , so they need to hear a friendly voice .
 Friendly ? Absolutely .
 Speak loudly and clearly , but , uh , be careful with the loud and clear ,
 ' cause it can come off as angry .
 Be folksy .
 Put a little sunshine in your voice .
 Got it . Okay . You need coffee or water ?
 You need to hit the head before things --
 Oh , there it goes .

 Mr. mcgill will take your call .

 You 're gonna go inside , buy a cup of coffee , a meal -- whatever -- and sit in a booth .
 Sometime in the next 10 to 15 minutes , a guy in an old green Chevy blazer is gonna pull into that parking lot .
 He 'll take a knapsack , and he 'll go inside .
 I need you to keep an eye on the knapsack .
 Let me know what he does with it .
 Does he take anything out of it ?
 Does he switch the bag with someone ?
 Does he leave something from the bag inside ? Jimmy : Right , right , right .
 I got it . Green Chevy blazer , black top . Yeah .
 What 's in the bag ?
 Is it money ? It 's got to be money .
 Drugs ?
 Is it drugs ? Something else ?
 Well , um , I 'm Guessing money . Tell me I 'm right .
 He is gonna be here any minute .
 Now , i need you inside .
 You gonna do the job or not ?
 Fine . I 'll do the job .
 You charmed me into it .

 He came in , like you said he would .
 He ordered the number three with potatoes and coffee , went bold with the extra salsa , and he paid cash out of his left front pocket .



 Uh , took his tray of food , sat in a booth on the east side of the restaurant , and put the knapsack on the floor .
 Where on the floor ?
 Under his seat , between his legs . Nobody touched it .
 He didn 't talk to anybody .
 He didn 't even at anybody .
 Finished his meal in five minutes , tops , and skedaddled -- didn 't leave anything behind .
 And you 're sure of that ?
 I literally checked the trash can . There was nothing in there but trash .

 So ... What 's our next move , huh ?
 Are we gonna follow this guy ?
 ' Cause you -- you got some real James Bond stuff in here .
 This car doesn 't have an ejector seat , does it ?
 I think we 're done for today .
 That 's it ? That 's it .

 I mean , i cleared my morning .
 What -- we 're not gonna do , like , uh , Tail him to a new location ?
 Or , I mean , we got to sit on him , at least .
 I -- thanks for your time .


 Hey , who 's got your back , huh ?
 Me -- that 's who .


 I 'll keep that in mind .

 Oh , Kim , the conference call with the Arizona regulator needs to be rescheduled .
 Thursday okay ?
 Oh , yeah , that 's fine .
 Okay .
 Francesca , have we got any more of those dietetic butter cookies ?
 I can check .
 Thanks .
 Mm- hmm .
 Welcome , folks !
 Hey , Ernie .
 What 's up ?


 Can 't you just come inside ?



 Sorry .
 Thanks .
 What are we doing out here ?
 I didn 't want to call you because then it would leave a phone record .
 I was gonna come in , but then I thought maybe Jimmy shouldn 't see me .
 So ...
 But you just called me .
 Oh .
 Guess I screwed up already .
 Ernie , screwed what up ?
 Why don 't you want to see Jimmy ?
 Well , it 's just ...
 I 'm not sure how to start .
 You can start by just telling me .

 Here 's the thing .
 I have some information , but I don 't want to get in trouble .
 Trouble with Jimmy ?
 No .
 With hhm .
 I think I 'm bound by confidentiality , maybe ?
 I 'm a little hazy on the legal points , but if I tell what I heard and not Jimmy directly ,

 like ...
 Like , we have a buffer , then legally , I 'm safe ?
 Ernie .
 What the hell are you talking about ?
 I 'm -- I 'm just worried about Jimmy .
 But if I tell him ...
 I don 't want to get in trouble , too .
 Tell Jimmy what ?
 Lily , I want to thank you for bringing your mom down .
 It was a delight to meet young lady .
 Oh . Thank you , Jimmy .
 And you tell your friends , even if they already have a will , it 's important to get it updated , just like you did .
 I 'll tell them .
 Now , you remember Francesca -- she 'll take care of you the rest of the way .
 All right , who 's next ? Mr. witchell .
 Mr. witchell , come on down !
 You 're the next contestant on " the price is right " !
 Jimmy , can I have a moment ?
 Excuse me , sir . Um , looks like everything is ... Apologies , Mr. witchell .
 Uh , I 'll just be a second , folks . Oh , my gosh .
 Have you guys had the soup over at cracker barrel today ?



 What ?
 What ? !
 Hey , come on . I got people out there .
 Hello .
 I can 't -- gimme a dollar .
 Give you a dollar ?
 Yeah , just hand me a dollar .
 Okay . C 'mon .
 All I got 's a $20 . Fine .
 Whatever .
 All right .
 I 'm your lawyer now .
 If anyone asks me what I know , we have confidentiality .
 Why do we need confidentiality ?
 Jimmy , what did you say to Chuck ?
 Oh .
 Here it comes .
 Howard , right ?
 Did Howard call ? R- relax .
 No .
 Let me explain , please .
 Please .
 Kim , let me set the stage for you , okay ?
 When I went to Chuck 's place last week , it was like the inside of a jiffy pop wrapper , all right ?

 There was mylar on the walls .
 There was mylar on the ceiling -- the ceiling .
 He thought his brain wasn 't working because of the mesa verde of it , and so I kinda told him that he was right about everything .
 I had to .
 He -- he -- Kim , he was broken .
 He was a broken man !
 I couldn 't leave him in crazy town like that !
 So I told him , you know , just to make him feel better , but it doesn 't matter what he says -- it doesn 't matter who he tells , because it 's my word against his !
 Jimmy , there 's a tape .
 What ?
 There is a tape recording of you talking to Chuck .
 What do you mean ?
 Who ? Who ?
 He -- he taped me ?
 How ? I don 't know how .
 He just did , okay ?
 Ernie told me . Ernie told you ?
 He said Chuck has a tape recorder wrapped in a space blanket in his desk drawer .
 Ernie was putting new batteries in it for Chuck , and the tape rolled for a few seconds , and he heard you -- your voice -- saying something about switching 1261 to 1216 .

 So , clearly , it was this confession of yours .


 He taped me ?






 Yes , Jimmy .

 But I 'm not sure what he can do with it ... ... legally , anyway .
 I 'm gonna have to do some research .
 He made that tape for a reason , and we just have to figure out why .

 Jimmy ?
 I gotta get back to it .
 The lobby 's full of clients .
 Okay .
 We 'll figure this out .
 Yeah .
 I know .
 Sorry for the delay , everyone !
 Mr. witchell , thank you for your Patience .
 I see you brought paperwork .

 I got to say , i would never have thought to collect bottle caps .
 Oh , it 's a wonderful hobby .
 What excites me is the hunt .
 I can imagine .
 Pleasure doing business with you , Mr. tiller .
 Why , thank you , Jimmy .
 All right , then . You drive safe .
 Oh , I do .

 Is that the last one , or we got any stragglers coming through ?
 Francesca : Last one .
 Well , hey , thanks , Francesca .
 You were great today .
 You , too .
 Those folks love you .
 Who doesn 't ?

 And that 's U. S. v. McKeever ?
 Right .
 No , it makes sense .
 You were a tremendous help , professor .
 Thanks for finding the time .
 You , too .
 Thanks again .
 Francesca , could you do me a favor ?
 Can you go through the mesa verde files in my office and pull all the ones labeled " cra evaluations " and sort them by date ?
 I need to make sure i have the most recent .
 Absolutely .
 Thank you .
 I 'll join you in a minute . Okay .

 So ...
 Just got off the phone with my old crim- pro professor .
 Oh , yeah ?
 What 'd he say ?
 Well , as we know , new Mexico is one- party consent , so Chuck had a right to make the recording .
 But you went to him worried for his mental health .
 You said the things you did to make him feel better , which
 Mitigates the admission of guilt , at the very least .
 We can poke holes in the custody , throw doubt the voice on the tape is even yours .
 Even failing that , its probative value doesn 't outweigh how prejudicial it is .
 I think we can get the whole thing bounced under 403 .
 Probably get it excluded outright . So , then ...
 Outside the courts , what can you do ?
 Play the tape for Kevin at mesa verde ?
 He hasn 't up to now . I 'd have heard something , for sure . And you know what ?
 I don 't think he 's going to .
 I don 't think Howard will let him near mesa verde with that tape .
 Howard knows it would make hhm look terrible .



 If Chuck has a plan for this tape ,
 I don 't know what it is .
 At this point , all we can do is wait for his move , then act accordingly .



 All right , then .
 Thanks .
 Sure .
 Oh , hey , what do you think ?
 Um , it 's " etude in blue " over " daydream harvest . "
 I wanted it to look like morning over the sandias . I like it .
 It looks nice .
 It doesn 't look like a stock- market crash ?
 No .
 It doesn 't look like a stock- market crash .
 It 's nice .
 Thanks .
 You okay ?
 Kim , I 'm good .









 Yeah .

 Howard , what are you doing here ?
 Chuck , do you have a second ?
 Did you -- you parked over on the next block ?
 Oh , yeah .
 Mm .
 Way over .
 Uh , phone .
 Keys .
 Hey , you have to hide them .

 Everything okay , sir ?
 Yes , thank you , David .
 Give us a moment .
 Yes , sir .

 What 's up ?
 Chuck ...
 This has been going on for eight days now , and really , no indication that it 's going to work .
 It will work .
 I think I 've been very patient , but the cost of these
 ' round- the- clock private investigators is ...
 Really starting to add up .
 Howard , this is our duty .
 As officers of the court , we have an ethical obligation to -- yes .
 My brother broke the law .
 We can 't just sit back and do nothing .
 I 'm not talking about doing nothing .
 I just want to ...
 Free up our minds and be open to alternate strategies , please .
 Meet me halfway here .

 I suppose -- I suppose we could limit the investigators to just nighttime hours .
 Nighttime .
 Yes .
 Jimmy will most likely break in while he thinks I 'm sleeping --
 I mean , I wouldn 't put anything past him .
 It just makes the most sense he 'll try to steal the tape under cover of darkness .
 You really think he 's going to do that ? I do , indeed .
 How can you be so sure ?
 Howard , I know my brother .
 Jimmy :
 Chuck !
 Chuck !
 Open the damn door , Chuck !
 Open the door , damn it ! Open it !
 Chuck ! Chuck : Jimmy , go away !
 Open the door ! Open it now ! I 'm not opening the door !
 I swear to god , Chuck ...
 I am not op -- Jimmy ! Jimmy !
 You taped me ? ! You asshole ! Jimmy !
 You pulled that heartstrings con job on me ? !
 You piece of shit !

 " Ohh , my brain used to work . I 'm sick .
 I don 't know what to do ! "
 Asshole !
 No wonder Rebecca left you !
 What took her so long ? !



 There it is !


 Oh , here we go .
 Here we go !
 Here we go !


 Oh !
 Is this it ?
 Is this it ? Is this it ?
 Huh ?
 For this , you destroyed our family ?
 You happy now ? !
 For what ? !
 For nothing !
 Is that all there is , Chuck ?
 It 's all the -- all there is ?
 Or 'd you make copies ?
 Huh , Chuck ?
 Huh ?
 You tell me , or I 'll burn this whole goddamn house to the ground !
 Jimmy !
 Jimmy !
 That 's enough !

 You need to step away . Howard ...
 You were a witness to what happened here ?
 I was .
 And you ?
 I 'm a witness .
