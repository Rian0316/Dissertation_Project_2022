 00 : 00 : 03, 691 -- > 00 : 00 : 06, 060 Max , guess what Han 's doing at the counter ?
 Well , I know it 's not towering over it .
 He 's creating signature drinks for the diner .
 I suggested any household poison over shaved ice .
 Han , this is a stupid idea .
 It was Earl 's .
 Then it 's genius .
 Yep , I 've been drinking all afternoon for free .
 Now , I 've used only top shelf liquor .
 Question :
 Who got it down for you ?
 First up : " The Max " .
 It 's just whiskey .
 On the rocks , like Max 's job .
 Whatever mine is , I want my rim salted .
 Of course you do .
 Earl 's is an Old Fashioned with everything .
 Pour me another me .
 I hate to say it , but I go down easy .
 " The Caroline " is Lemon Schnapps in a slightly frosty glass .
 Because of my cool , Grace Kelly kind of demeanor ?
 No , because they had a sale on Lemon Schnapps at Beverage Barn
 Oh , they don 't card there ?
 Okay , so what 's " The Han " ?
 A No Sex on the Beach ?
 Mine is a classic martini , shaken .
 Oh , like the first woman who saw you naked .
 Correction .
 Will see you naked .

 Max , guess what happened when you were running to the bathroom real quick , for two hours .
 You worked the cupcake window while I went to see The Statue of Liberty .
 Her head was being renovated .
 Everybody in this town is getting work done .
 I sold our last cupcake tee !
 We 've sold out more than Robert De Niro in the last 20 years of his career .
 Well , analyze this , Focker .

 I noticed we were running low last week , so I ordered more .
 How did I not notice those sooner ?
 Oh , probably because the last time I looked in there , there was a rat having sex with a cockroach .
 You know , they 're still dating .
 Really ?
 I thought it was a one time thing .
 Well , I guess once you go rat , you never go back .
 Thanks for ordering these , I 've just been so busy with Sophie 's wedding shower .
 Yeah , why are you working so hard ?
 It 's not a big deal .
 I threw my mother a shower once .
 No wait , I threw her in a shower once .
 Max , you really need to start making more of a fuss .
 It 's for Sophie , it means a lot to her , and she has a gun .
 Well , showers are stupid girl things that this guy wants no part of .
 Hey , girls !
 Look .
 I 'm advertising your cupcake business .
 You 're advertising something , but it 's not our cupcakes .
 I gave out free T- shirts to our building .
 I left one by everyone 's door .
 Two at Sophie 's , 16 at the Sanchez 's .
 So about six of the kids will have to share .
 Interesting .
 Now our shirts are available at both Rodney , the high- end Manhattan boutique , and an apartment building that always smells a little like gasoline .

 Well , please stop talking about things that aren 't me .
 Now girls , did you get the cake for my wedding shower tomorrow ?
 Oh , was I supposed to make a cake ?
 I 've literally done nothing for this shower .
 I haven 't even taken a bath .
 Oh , no , I 'm not getting my cake from here .
 No , this is my bridal shower .
 Yeah , I want to get something classic from Baskin Robbins that 's also a Dunkin ' Donuts .
 They mix those two now ?
 It 's a stoner 's dream come true .
 I tried to make our apartment look nice .
 I even moved a chair to cover a stain , but what was under the chair was so much worse .
 I guess what I 'm saying is , please don 't shoot us .
 Well , I don 't expect it to look that good .
 I mean , you can 't put a silk hat on a pig .
 And I know , 'cause I tried once .
 [ gags ]
 [ gags ]
 Max ! Oh , my God !

 What have you done ?
 I realized I don 't like a strawberry center .
 And I am not going to beat myself up about it .
 When I told you to get crepe paper streamers and decorate for the shower , I meant with pink , not black .
 It 's a wedding shower for Sophie , not a baby shower for Rosemary 's Baby .
 What ?
 I told you , I don 't do girl things .
 Like hang pink or sit when I pee .
 Which , coincidentally , I refer to as " hanging pink . "
 My God , what is that smell ?
 Something 's really gone bad here .
 Besides our lives .
 It 's the Polish food .
 I think one of those sausages is made of old flip- flops .
 [ knock at door ]
 Someone 's here already ?
 Are Polish people always early ?
 Is that a stereotype I don 't know about ?
 Oh my God !
 A wedding shower for me ?
 I mean , if I had known , I would have dressed !
 Sophie , you did know .
 I know .
 I came down early to practice some entrances .
 Now get ready for entrance number two .
 Are you ever ready for entrance number two ?
 [ knock at door ]
 Who is it ?
 [ fakes weeping ]
 Oh my God !
 I can 't believe it .
 Oh , it 's the day of my wedding shower .
 Could anything be more wonderful ?
 I was moved , I was surprised .
 I liked it better than the book .
 Now , come on in here and identify some of this
 Polish food so I can know what I 'm not eating tonight .
 Oh , no .
 I 'm not eating at my shower .
 I 'm pretending I have an eating disorder so everyone will think that I have it all .
 I think you 're going to be happy .
 I have lots of fun shower games , starting with " Who Knows The Most About Sophie ? "
 Oh , I 'll win that one .
 Yeah .
 And Sophie 's got to tinkle .
 See ?
 I 'm a shoo- in .
 Yeah . Oh .
 Oh , my gosh .
 Black toilet paper .
 Oh , nice touch , girls .
 Yeah , I love the mystery of not knowing when you 're done .
 [ knock at door ]
 ( Agent Drake ) FBl !
 Open up !
 The FBl ?
 I don 't think they RSVP 'd .
 Oh , that 's got to be for me .
 I didn 't do it .
 And just so you know , the statute of limitations is up on that Newark thing .
 I 'm not here to arrest you , miss .
 Great , it 's me .
 Max , I told you pirating movies was a real crime .
 Now I 'm going to jail for
 Someone should .
 I hear you , not the Christian Grey
 I 'd pictured .
 I 'm Agent Drake with the FBl .
 Nothing to get upset about , but there 's a man in your building who 's been holding three women hostage in his apartment for months .
 Yeah , that sounds about right .
 Now , one of the captives escaped today and alerted authorities .
 Oh , that must have been the lady I passed screaming in the hall .
 There is a fine line between " hostage " and " off your meds " in this building .
 What ?
 So , a SWAT team is going in for the other two still upstairs .
 But we need to evacuate the building first .
 So let 's go .
 All right , can I just put a few things away first .
 You know , because I want the place to look nice if there 's going to be police in here .
 Look , miss , whatever drugs you 're hiding in here ,
 I couldn 't care less .
 We need to get out now .
 You know , you 're just my type of guy .
 You don 't mind my drug use and you 're already here .
 Oh , yeah !
 You girls ordered a cop stripper for my bridal shower ?
 Oh , here comes the bride all right !
 Come on .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , see ?
 Look , he likes me .
 I cannot believe I live in this building with a man who would do something so awful .
 Also , cannot believe I live in this building .
 You know who I think it is ?
 Smells Like Cats But Has No Cats .
 Really ?
 He doesn 't seem like a go- getter .
 I think it 's Three Nipples No Nose .
 Three Nipples No Nose ?
 He 's a delight .
 Sophie , isn 't this upsetting ?
 It sure is .
 I couldn 't get that stripper cop to take his pants off .
 Hey , look , there 's some of my shower guests .
 Oh , look .
 And see ?
 That one 's my friend Natalya .
 The one I told you about .
 Yeah , there 's all that extra skin .
 Ew .
 You were not exaggerating .
 She was born with all that skin .
 She had a chip clip on her back all through high school .
 Yeah , I know that guy upstairs is a real bummer , but you know what would help ?
 If I could open my presents .
 Yeah .
 ( Sophie ) Oh , no !
 The fuzz isn 't letting them through !
 Oh , come on .
 No fair , they just let a guy in here a few minutes ago .
 Just 'cause your friends aren 't bomb- sniffing dogs , they can 't get in ?
 Boo !
 Hey , look , ladies , pass your presents up to the cops .
 Cops , pass my presents to me .
 Wait , Sophie , before you open them ,
 I really want to write down who got you what .
 And save that pretty ribbon , I 'm gonna make you a bow hat !
 Look at you .
 Making lemonade out of a maniac holding three innocent women hostage .
 ( Sophie ) Oh , a gift card .
 Oh , send it back .
 Sophie , we would 've taken that .
 I don 't know what is was for ,
 I just know that we would 've taken it .
 No , I 'm sending it back .
 I want a gift , not another errand .
 Oh , yeah , not in love with the paper , but ... well , I 'll wait till I open it to judge .
 ( Maria ) Hi .
 Excuse me .
 Excuse me ?
 I 'm Maria Alonso- Gonzalez .
 Could you ladies talk to Channel 2 about tonight 's disturbing discovery ?
 - No .
 - Yes .
 Just go with me and my business savvy .
 Yes , Maria Alonso- Gonzalez , we can answer a few questions .
 Were there any signs at all that something of this nature was going on in your building ?
 We just hope they bring this sick freak in our building to justice so that we can return to work at Max 's Homemade Cupcakes .
 ( Maria ) Get on the door .
 Here he comes .
 Who is it ?
 Who is this sick freak ?
 It 's not me .
 Is it ?
 I 'm not sure , what are the charges ?
 Different sick freak .
 Hey , Rula , Uma , Greta , look .
 ( Sophie ) This is him .
 This is the groom- to- be .
 Forget about the guy upstairs , this is the real maniac in the bedroom .
 [ gasping ]
 That 's him ?
 Beer Belly Gym Shorts ?
 - Never would 've guessed .
 - Oh , no .
 ( Caroline ) He 's wearing one of our shirts .
 Why ?
 Why ?
 Why is he wearing a medium ?
 Oh ...
 I mean , nobody 's gonna see that .
 ( Maria ) Police have just apprehended the suspect and the question on everyone 's mind is ,
 " What does Max 's Homemade Cupcakes have to do with this ? "
 We have no comment .
 Or future , or deodorant .
 So leave us alone !
 How did they find out we work in this dump , next door to the other dump ?
 As I 'm saying it , I realize our career is made up of two dumps .
 Sounds like our career has been drinking too much coffee .
 The story is all over the paper .
 They 're calling those ladies " The Cupcake Captives , " calling that guy " The Cupcake Captor , " and calling the whole thing " The Cupcake Catastrophe . "
 But you needn 't worry about it reflecting badly on your cupcake business .
 Oh , no .
 It 's even in the fashion section .
 There 's a picture of our shirts and it says ,
 " What not to wear , ever . "
 Okay .
 Everybody calm down .
 I 'm mostly talking to myself .
 The media is just going to do its thing .
 I 've been slandered in the headlines before .
 I was called " Ponzi Princess , " " Bankrupt Barbie . "
 Looking back , those were the best of times .
 Oh , hello .
 I was just about to take a tray of Max and Carolines out to my reporter friends .
 Sorry , you can give those Max and Carolines to this Max and Caroline .
 Hi , everybody .
 Oh , I 'm depressed .
 See , you can tell 'cause I 'm only wearing half my hair .
 Girls , I found this box outside your door .
 And I was hoping it was a shower present .
 Since those selfish hostage girls ruined my special day .
 Oh , man .
 I didn 't even get a freakin ' ribbon hat .
 Do you want the tube top I made out of the police tape ?
 I 'm calling it a tape top .
 Patent pending .
 Come on , you guys .
 This isn 't about us .
 We need to put this all in perspective .
 We 're all safe , and healthy , and ...
 Oh , my God , just when I can 't take anymore , here comes anymore .
 " We are returning the remainder of your t- shirt stock .
 " Our Rodney brand cannot be associated with a product
 " at the center of an ongoing criminal investigation .
 Consider our contract null and void . "
 This is so shocking .
 Max , you can read ?
 So you just didn 't want to tell people the specials .
 I can 't believe this .
 We waited so long for something to happen to our cupcake t- shirts .
 Why that guy ?
 And on the one day he chooses to not wear his " Pull my finger " shirt .
 ( Maria ) This is Maria Alonso- Gonzalez , reporting to you live ...
 Max , what are you doing ?
 They 'll see us . - from Max 's Homemade Cupcakes .
 - No they won 't ,
 Because all the cameras are on Han right now .
 Can you talk a little bit about the women behind Max 's Homemade Cupcakes ?
 Well , let 's just say Max and Caroline are allergic to work , much in the same way
 Dilbert is allergic to Mondays .
 [ laughs ]
 Moving on , Maria Alonso- Gonzalez , would you care to come into The Williamsburg Diner , 6355 Bedford Avenue , open 8 : 00 A. M. till 2 : 00 A. M. , for our signature drink :

 The Cupcake Captive Cosmo ?
 And for you gents , The Captive Cape Cod ?
 Hey , get these cupcakes out of the garbage .
 I need to make room for Han 's body .
 I 'm keeping the head as a warning to others who cross us .
 We need to take back our t- shirts ' image by setting up an interview with the news .
 And by " we , " I mean you .
 Look , if I learned one thing from my time on it 's that I can hop a fence in three seconds flat .
 If I learned two things , it 's that the camera makes me look guilty .
 Especially when it 's a security camera at Banana Republic .
 I can 't do it .
 The world can 't know that Caroline Channing is involved in another high- profile crime .
 And hasn 't kept up her nail maintenance , like , at all .
 Fine .
 Because if I learned three things from it 's that it 's best to surrender early and not naked .
 We really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us .
 If you really want to thank me , how about I get some pixels up over my grill ?
 I got some kids looking for me and they don 't need the help .
 We don 't have the capability to do that .
 This is live TV .
 How about one of those voice distorting machines ?
 You know , make my voice sound like a fat Transformer .
 Um , no .
 No problem .
 I 'll take care of that myself .
 Been in this sitch before .
 All right , in 3 , 2 ...
 Good evening .
 In Williamsburg ...
 Max , I 'm right here , if you need me .
 - I got this . - Now infamous in the shocking
 " Cupcake Captives " story .
 I 'm here with the owner , Max Black .
 [ distorted ] Hi , Maria .
 Max , how upset were you to see that Richard Griffin was Max 's Homemade Cupcakes ' biggest fan ?
 [ distorted ] I was really upset .
 Okay , hi .
 Stepping in .
 Max is clearly so upset by all this that she 's lost her mind .
 The one time I really needed her , anyway .
 Hi , Maria .
 How will your company 's reputation recover from doing business with a man who held three women in his apartment against their will ?
 Look , people do terrible things .
 And they do them wearing shirts .
 That doesn 't make the shirt evil .
 Now , if a shirt commits a crime , lock it up .
 You 'll get no argument from me .
 [ distorted ] Should I jump back in ?

 Okay , yeah .
 That 's all the time we have .
 - Thank you .
 - Mm- hmm .
 [ distorted ] Thank you .
 Caroline , thank you for trying to throw me a shower .
 I mean , we were never really friends or close .
 And yeah , I run away when I see you heading towards the mailboxes the same time as me ...
 Please stop thanking me .
 Hey .
 Want to come to our place ?
 Those pig feet haven 't gone bad .
 I guess .
 It 's hard to tell .
 Yeah .
 The best meat 's under the toe nails .
 Is it ?
 ( all ) Surprise .
 [ shouting ]
 Oh , my God , what 's all this ?
 Oh , no .
 I 'm so surprised .
 No , I really am this time .
 - So am I. - Me , too .
 Until this sausage , I thought the grossest thing
 I 'd ever eaten was kale .
 Oh , my God , I can 't believe it .
 Could anything be more wonderful ?
 [ laughs ]
 Max , I can 't believe you did all this .
 I thought you came home to do what you usually do when you get depressed .
 Get drunk and throw the finger at people from the stoop .
 No stoop .
 But I am drunk .
 You think I could 've done this sober ?
 I just figured , with everything around us being so black lately ,
 I thought we needed a little pink .
 You 're right .
 We did .
 ' Cause our t- shirt business is over .
 And we still have to pay off that bank loan .
 Now what ?
 We 'll figure something out .
 We always do .
 Hey , girls , come quick .
 We 're gonna play " Guess Sophie 's Favorite Sex Position " ( all ) Whoo !
 It 's on all fours , watching
 See ?
 I told you I was gonna win .
 And it just got black again .
 Yeah , real black .
 This is wet .
 Max , did you already eat this ?
 I told you I don 't like a strawberry centre .
 I am not gonna beat myself up about it .
