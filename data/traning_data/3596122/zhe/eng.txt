 --- That 's it for tonight . Time to count the tip jar .
 Hand condom . I can 't believe you .

 Using protection is so five years ago .
 This is Williamsburg .
 There 's a good chance even the dollars have herpes .
 Well , if those singles have herpes , they should just lie about it till they get married
 like everybody else does .
 Oh , good , you 're still open .
 Oh , yes , we are .
 What can I get you ?
 Everything in the register .
 Oh , my God .
 It 's a hipster hold- up .
 Hand it over .
 I have a gun .
 Well , I have a death wish so that 's not gonna work .
 Look , pal , we work at this cupcake window 2 : 00 to 4 : 00 , six nights a week , and that is after eight hours of slinging hash at the diner next door for lousy minimum wage , which a bunch of rich politicians out in --


 - help me out .
 - Washington .
 What she said -- don 't wanna raise .
 Then , we walk home to our illegal one bedroom apartment , get three hours of Nyquil induced sleep before we have to get back up and share a bowl of Spanish language cheerios .

 It 's the same thing but the " C " wears a sombrero .
 So , no , I am not about to give you our hard- earned money .
 And if you 're gonna shoot me , better aim good . ' cause if you miss , I will climb over this counter , tear off your head , and it 'll be our new tip jar .
 Yeah , I just robbed Pizza Pizza .
 Here 's a $20 .
 Have a good night .
 I have a way with people .



 Look , I just saw that our cupcake competition ,
 " Brooklyn Bitty Bites , " went out of business .
 Yup , it 's being changed into a medical marijuana store .
 I already have my hole- punch card .
 Buy four brownies and the fifth buzz is free .
 Brooklyn Bitty Bites bit it !
 Yeah !
 We won !
 Eat it , red haired lady and your asian daughter !
 Max , them going down right after the death of the cupcake giant , " Crumbs , " is scary .
 It 's like there 's a serial killer out there coming after cupcakes .
 Well , he should be easy to outrun ,
 ' cause that 'll be one fat Dexter .
 Seriously , we have a big problem .
 I 'm back !
 And there 's our little problem .
 Wow , you don 't usually see the ventriloquist 's dummy out of his suitcase alone .
 Hello , Earl .
 Hello , Caroline .
 Hello , reason I do two hours of phone therapy every Wednesday before work .
 So , did you all miss me ?
 You were gone ?
 ' Cause I swear I just saw you yesterday .
 Wait , maybe that was a cat .

 I was gone , people !
 To San Francisco for a convention .
 The restaurant and diner association .
 " Radass . "
 You were at something called " Radass " in San Francisco ?
 Are you sure it wasn 't " Redass " ?
 I am not gay .
 I 'm restaurant curious .
 I discovered an exciting new item for our menu .
 No way .
 No new menu additions .
 I already lie awake in bed worrying about how high the food bar is here .
 Pick up !
 Pulled pork .
 And it 's good 'cause before I pulled it ,
 I gave it a dry rub .
 It 's $4 toast . $4 toast ?
 That 's $5 more than our toast is worth .
 Delicious , homemade artisan bread .
 At first , I was reluctant to put something so big in my mouth .
 But the hot butter drizzling down my chin was my sticky reward .
 Han , that toast is trendy foodie food .
 It 'll die here , like my soul did .
 Our customers are just plain , normal people .
 Hey , everybody !
 And sophie .
 Guess what ?
 78 guys want me on Tinder .
 Oh , 79 !
 Now it 's 80 !
 How long have you been on Tinder ?
 Ten minutes !
 Oh , look , oh , my gosh !
 This guy 's a plumber .
 Are you kidding me ?
 Yes , that 's a match !
 And this guy isn 't even wearing a shirt !
 That 's another big yes !
 Oh , gosh , girls , I 'll be over here ,
 looking at boys in my booth .
 Hey , I know a girl who met her husband on tinder .
 No , wait , she saw her husband on tinder .
 Hey , are wheelchairs sexy ?
 I guess it depends on who 's in one .
 I say no .
 Hold the presses .
 I just got a new tweet from my gal ,
 Kim Kardashian .
 Oh , she just bought her some new boots in Manhattan .
 Kim Kardashian is epic .
 She was on the cover of Vogue .
 She 's on fire .
 So ?
 I 've been on fire .
 That 's the last time I try witchcraft for the free snacks .
 I love the Kardashians .
 They 're like the Kennedys but with bigger asses .
 Text me next time .
 This whole talking thing is insane .
 Hi !
 Who would I talk to about finding the owner of Max 's Homemade Cupcakes ?
 That 's Max .
 I 'm Caroline .
 We 're the owners of this store .
 And about four pairs of socks .
 Great .
 Wonderful .
 Such a cute shop .
 Would you be interested in having a popular --
 Yes . I didn 't finish my sentence .
 Sorry , I just haven 't heard the word " popular " in so long .
 Oh , yeah , she 's over .
 She 's the Blockbuster video of people .
 Would you be interested in having a popular reality show filmed here ?
 Y --
 I 'm so sorry .
 I have to take this .
 Just a minute .
 What ?
 Just say it already .
 Come on .
 Max , this is great .
 Think of the exposure .
 I wonder which reality show it is .
 Ooh , maybe 16 and Pregnant is doing a " where are they now " segment and they found me .
 Or that one about you , " Here comes honey boobless . "
 Do you have any idea who I am ?
 You just do what I say or you are out !
 Okay .
 Mommy loves you .
 Sorry , my baby 's Nigerian .
 I mean , if you 're gonna live here , learn the language .
 Jeez .

 So what are we thinking ?
 We 'd love it .
 We 're in .
 What show ?
 Keeping up with the Kardashians .
 Finally , God opens a door .
 And I 'm closing a window .
 Max !
 She 's overwhelmed .
 Big fan . Do you have a card ?
 And listen , text me .
 Don 't call .
 It freaks me out .
 Just give me one good reason why we shouldn 't keep up with the Kardashians .
 I 'll give you five good reasons .
 Kim , Kamber , Klondike ... and the little ones , Krispy and Kreme .
 Not even close .
 Fine .
 Kim , Kooky , Kool- aid , and the little ones , Kaptain and kangaroo .
 It 's Kim , Kourtney , Khloe , Kylie , and Kendall .
 That mother has some nerve , naming a kid who 's probably never even read a book " Kindle . "
 We need this .
 Everyone watches Keeping up with the Kardashians .
 It 's like Dancing with the Stars , but without the stars .
 So , Dancing with the Stars .
 Okay , tell me one good thing about this show that I hate ,
 ' cause I 've never seen it .
 Well , it 's all about this family and their struggle to ... keep up .
 Yeah , okay .
 I 've never seen it either .
 Sophie , thank you so much for letting us come up after work to watch your tv .
 Max turned our old one into a bong .
 That was another time I was on fire .
 Well , which episode do you want to watch ?
 " Kim gets a new hat . " or " Kylie cries at Coachella " ?
 Or " Khloe gets a bikini wax " ?
 Now that one 's a classic .
 How many of these do you have DVR 'd ?
 Well , I got 17 on this tv and 53 on the one in the bedroom .
 I like to go to sleep with the sound of Kim 's voice .
 It 's so comforting when she says ,
 " this is super awkward . "
 And you know , sometimes she arches her back when she says it , like this .
 " This is super awkward . "
 This is super awkward .
 You know , I bet you if I stayed in Poland , my sisters and I would have had our own show .
 It would 've been called , Keeping up with the Kachinskis .
 It 's too bad we all didn 't live to see 20 .
 It 's not cute .
 You know I need someone to make me laugh .
 Where 's kim ?
 Kim is always late .

 Stop !
 Enough !
 That 's it , we 're done .
 Hey , get the hell out !
 It 's morning !
 I know , I know , but we couldn 't stop watching them do nothing .
 This show is freaking genius !
 Is the blonde one crying ?
 Kris and Kim are in Vienna and someone stole Kris 's Bottega bag and her Chanel clutch with the matching pumps that she bought in Paris . Mm- hmm .



 All right , well , I have to go take my morning tinkle .
 But when I come back , I want you two to be out of here because I need that swing for my exercises .
 We have to do this show .
 It 'll be so great for our business .
 The only way we 'd get more exposure is if Orlando Bloom and Bieber bitchslapped each other in front of our shop .
 Who cares about our business ?
 I want that mother to adopt me !
 Her kid makes a sex tape , she turns it into millions .
 The only thing my mother ever did with my sex tape was copy it and give it to her boyfriend .
 I 'm so excited .
 Max , this is what I look like when I 'm happy .
 You 've never seen it .
 Please call me by my new name , Khlamydia Kardashian .
 Don 't say anything stupid like that .
 I won 't have to say anything .
 Kris will see me and recognize me as one of her own with my lips , my boobs , and my willingness to live in some place called calabasas .
 They 're here .
 My life changes now !
 This is what I look like happy .
 You 've never seen it .
 Hi , we are so , so excited about this .
 There has been a change .
 They 're not coming .
 It 's too far to walk in heels . See ?
 She might as well have been my real mom
 ' cause she just chose a heel over me .
 Hi , here I am to meet Kiki , my bff .
 And look at my new dress !
 Twinsies !
 They certainly are .
 Sorry , she 's not coming .
 We had to film them in jamba juice instead .
 Well , this is super awkward .
 Stupid Kardashians !
 Kim , Kankels , Krank , and the little ones , kegel and kickball ,
 You can kiss my keister .
 Max , stop it !
 I 'm trying to sleep .
 Well , sorry , but I 'm pissed and it 's 11 : 30 anyway .
 What 's going on ?
 Even one tweet from Kim would have exposed us to 22 million followers .
 Scientology doesn 't even have those numbers .
 - They screwed us .
 - I know .
 That is why I 'm making hate cupcakes for the Kardashians , see ?
 " Eat it , " " Bite me , "
 And these three ...
 " Get " " A " " Job . "
 Oh , and one for the mom that says , " I still love you , "
 Just in case .
 Now come on , get up .
 Your son needs to go out and take an 8- foot crap .
 No , I 'm done .
 If everyone 's done with cupcakes , so am I.
 I 'm done pretending that everything 's gonna work out .
 In our reality show , it 's not .
 Look , get up , or I will close this bed with you in it , and your new reality show will be true life :
 I live in a wall .
 I 'm not getting up . Ever .




 Max , stop , stop it !
 Stop it !
 Put me down !
 Put me down !

 What 's happening ?
 I can 't lift my head .
 Did I have a stroke ?
 No one has stroked in your bed since -- what is it , going on a year ? Calm down .




 Max .
 My hair is caught .
 My hair is caught !
 My hair is caught !
 Who are you yelling at ?
 The whole situation !
 Do something !
 Let me look .
 Oh yeah , it 's all caught up in the bed gears here .
 Oh my God , I have a bed with gears and my hair is caught in it !
 Ooh , nope .
 It 's really all stuck up in there .
 It 's so odd .
 I don 't know how a thing like this could happen .
 Uh , you put me up into the wall .
 And now I 'm trapped in a murphy bed
 like some welfare Rapunzel .
 Stop panicking , I 'll get a scissors .
 Oh , yeah , yeah !
 Get the scissors .
 Then plunge 'em into my heart
 ' cause I 'd rather die than cut my hair .
 Okay , Max , I think I have something that might work ,
 But you have to promise me that you will never bring this up again .
 What ?
 The fact that your head is stuck to your bed ?
 Sorry , that 's coming up again .
 Go into my nightstand and get my cinnamon- flavored make- up remover .
 You mean the lube ?

 Can we please call it make- up remover ?
 Please !
 I need us to do that .
 It 's almost empty .
 Man , you 've removed a lot of make- up .
 Stop it !
 Just squeeze some out and put it on the parts that we need to move .
 Yeah , I 'm familiar .


 Please tell me it 's working .
 I 'm trying , but ... I don 't think I can get your hair out .
 Good news is , I think we can fit a penis in there .
 Who could that be ?
 A rapist we 've done most of the work for .
 Oh , we were just talking about you .
 Max , you gotta help me with the bread for Han 's toast .
 I 've already burned ten of these .
 Turns out the only thing I can successfully bake is meth .
 Oleg , come to the bed .
 I need you !
 All right !
 Only took you four years , but I 'm here , baby .
 No , it 's not like that , Oleg .
 Just get over here !
 Okay .
 Hold this .
 Earl , what are you doing here ?
 Oleg called me when he couldn 't get Caroline to stop the screaming .
 Hi , Max .
 Earl gave me part of a brownie .
 Turns out , glaucoma and having hair stuck take the exact same prescription .
 Look !
 That 's right , you mothers !
 I did it !
 I made the perfect bread !
 You 're a chef who took 19 hours to make one loaf of bread .
 Stephen Hawking was more successful at the 100- yard dash .
 And you -- you are aware that I went all the way into Manhattan , cupcake- bombed Kim Kardashian 's hotel , and you 're still just laying here , right ?


 Didn 't you have to pee ?
 I held most of it in . This is crazy .
 You 've been here all day .
 Let 's just cut your damn hair already .
 I wouldn 't be me without my hair .
 I can 't live without it .
 Yes , you can .
 You have lived without money ,
 You 've lived without electricity ,
 You 've lived without plumbing .
 What do you think got me through it ?
 My hair .
 I 'd be like , " Lost all my money , the toilet 's clogged , still got my hair . "
 Darling , I don 't think those brownies are kicking in .
 I also have some lollipops .
 I hope you 're happy .
 I didn 't see anything through the peep- hole ,
 So I 'm guessing it 's Han .
 Ah , hello !
 I have an open diner and no diner staff !
 Han , look , I made perfect bread .
 It 's bigger than I 'm used to .
 Let me just take a minute and breathe .
 And I 'm sure I can take it all in .
 Well , if you need any help ,
 Caroline 's got some make- up remover .
 Kiki tweet , Kiki tweet , Kiki tweet !
 She 's saying " Kiki tweet " !
 How did he understand that ?
 Is he part dolphin ?
 Kim Kardashian tweeted a pic of my mean cupcakes and said , " Max 's Homemade Cupcakes # notcool . "
 Oh , my God , Kim Kardashian hates someone I know !
 That went out to 22 million people !
 - I 'm so sorry .
 - Why ?
 Do you know how many people can 't stand the Kardashians ?
 Our cupcake window will be packed !
 Cut me loose .
 Hey , Caroline , we 're finally about to scissor .
 Are you sure ?
 We got a business to run .
 Cut it , I 'll be fine .

 Yeah , you 're gonna need that lollipop .
 Yeah , I know , those Kardashians are the worst .
 That 's why I don 't keep up with them anymore .
 All right , Max .
 Okay , that 's it .
 Just one left .
 Not bad .
 And your hair 's not bad either .
 Yeah , now , after the emergency trip to that salon .
 When you got done with me ,
 I looked like a baby bird on chemo .
 I 'm sorry I had to use the last of our savings for my hair cut .
 - No , you 're not .
 - No , I am not , I love this .
 Hi , I 'm Kim .
 I just wanted to say sorry that we didn 't film here the other day .
 It almost hurts to look at her .
 I know how hard us girls really work to keep our businesses going ,
 So I 'll take a cupcake and I 'll totally tweet about it for real .
 Thank you so much .
 Here , here , here , here , here .
 We can 't break a $100 , and anyway , this is so on the house .
 Oh , thanks . Cute hair .
 Wait .
 Real quick ...
 Do you think your mother would adopt me ?
 This is super awkward . ---
