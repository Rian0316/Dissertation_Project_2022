 He loves these intimate spaces .
 It 's where he tries out all his new stuff .
 Le Jean 's a genius . He 's bringing them all to a climax .
 Holding off hitting that sweet spot as long as possible .
 They all worship him .
 You were awesome , babe . Bless ya , babes , bless ya , but , nah ...
 No , you smashed it . It wasn 't tight , you know what I mean ?
 It was . It was absolutely ...
 I was dropping beats all over the place , man .
 No , it was amazing , baby . I didn 't feel it , it was like ...
 - Yo . You the guy buying up all the clubs , right ?
 - Gary Harbinger .
 Gary is the owner of the Shimmers chain .
 Nice , man , nice . And you remember Kelly Sumner ?
 He 's been overseeing the legal side .
 My granddaughters are your biggest fans .
 They download all your records .
 Safe , man , safe . What about somedrinks , yeah ?
 Good idea , good idea . Yo , Darryl !
 Get these guys some , I don 't know , Jagermeisters or something like that .
 We 're making history tonight .
 Just to let you know your car 's here to take you to the helipad , OK ?
 Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . Guys , we have to wrap this up quick .
 Are you going somewhere ? Am I going some ... What , is this guy for real ?
 Le Jean plays a set at Pacha on Ibiza every Tuesday .
 - It 's a legendary night . - Everybody knows that , don 't they ?
 You want to attach my name to your clubs and you don 't know about my Pacha set ?
 Well , Marcus here handles the acts and the day- to- day business ...
 Whoa , whoa . See , haul up , haul up .
 See ...
 Are you ...
 Are you saying that what I do is an act ?
 Like , what , like I 'm some kind of mobile disco pig , available for weddings and Bar Mitzvahs ?
 Easy , big fella , easy .
 Do you know who I am ?
 Of course he does , Garry , of course he does , he 's just , er , he 's very protective of his image , yeah ?
 It 's a credibility issue .
 Yeah , it 's a credibility issue , it 's all about mystique as well .
 Did you see the people down there ? Did you see them ?
 They don 't come to one of my gigs cos they want to listen to music , man .
 It 's a pilgrimage , dread .
 And because I got that credibility , those people out there are my disciples , they worship at the decks of Le Jean .
 And that is what sells .
 Do you feel me ?
 I feel you .
 All right , look , I done schooling you , right ? Peace and love .
 Let 's get down to business , yeah ?
 One hundred grand in fifties , as you requested .
 It 's red . It 's my colour .
 Gentlemen , enjoy the drinks . Enjoy the company . Laters , yeah ?
 We should have stayed a bit longer .
 What , anything to do with the nearly naked girls ?
 We only booked them for an hour , someone should make sure they get home safely .
 The kid 's all heart . Thanks . Drinks are on us .
 - You Fisk ? - No , I 'm the Easter Bunny .
 You got something for me , or not ?
 My employer would look very favourably on the individual that put this guy out of business ... permanently .
 Can you do it ? - Won 't be easy .
 The five grand 's a down payment . There 's another 15 when it 's done .

 Cor , what 's that pong ?
 It smells like dead , wet dog in here .
 Edward .
 Hold your horses . I 'm nearly there .
 Oh , look , more bags . What , it 's not rancid enough in here ?
 You sure you got enough rubbish , Ed ?
 - It piles up , Sean . You 'd be amazed . - Surely this is a health hazard ?
 Yes , you 'd think so , wouldn 't you ?
 Erm , do you maybe want to explain what 's going on , Edward ?
 It 's a bloody outrage . That 's what 's going on . It 's a bloody scandal .
 The council has started fining you 200 quid for leaving your rubbish out over night .
 - Eh ? - See , they pick it up between eight and nine on a Tuesday morning .
 Before , you could leave your bags out on a Monday night .
 Now , some jobsworth environmental officer comes round and tells me I 've got to put them out just before they get here .
 - What do I pay me rates for ? - Well , take it out the back , then .
 There 's no access .
 Now I 've got to schlep it through the bar where there 's customers .
 Then this same inspector comes round and tells me I can 't take the rubbish through the bar during opening hours .
 So you can 't leave them out overnight or bring them through in the morning ?
 You 're a bit stuffed then , ain 't ya ?
 - Exactly . It 's a thingy- o - It 's a paradox ? - No .
 - No , a catch- 22 ? - No - Chinese puzzle ? - No .
 - A conundrum ? - No .
 - A mystery within a puzzle wrapped up in an enigma ? - Tell you what it is .
 It 's a downright flamin ' liberty , that 's what it is .
 - Ooh , I can feel a rant coming on . - Into the office then .
 Ed , when you 've finished moaning , can I have a full English ?
 Do you lot ever listen to a word I say ?
 Yeah , of course we do .
 Bags , bleedin ' councils , rates , by- laws , flamin ' liberties , eggs over easy , chunky toast , mug of tea , and three sugars .
 OK , everyone . Listen up .
 Michael Stone , aka Mickey Bricks .
 As some of you 'll know , Stone and his crew have been giving the fraud squad the run- around for years .
 I 've had a whisper that their next big scoop is on our patch .
 I 'm not having it .
 I want them shut down .
 Are fraud all right with this , guv ?
 I 'll talk them through it when Stone and his crew are locked up . I want round- the- clock surveillance .
 Albert Stroller . The Roper . Been grifting since the Boer War .
 He 's got contacts all over the city .
 Ash " Three Socks " Morgan . The Fixer .
 He knows more tricks than a cartful of monkeys .
 But this is where we start .
 Sean and Emma Kennedy .
 The newbies .
 Stroller found them making short cons on the street and brought them into the fold .
 He and Stone are training them up , moulding them into their own seedy image .
 These two are Stone 's soft underbelly .
 If we get to them , we can penetrate the inner circle , tear it apart .
 That 's how we get him .
 Read the file , get to know them , how they operate .
 Let 's show the third floor how it 's done .
 All right , come on , you heard the man .
 - Ma 'am . Didn 't see you there . - Who assigned you to this case ?
 My brief is to catch criminals and hit my crime target figures .
 I wasn 't aware that I had to have every case authorised before I launch an investigation .
 And does the fraud squad know you 're going after Stone ?
 The information I 've been given is that they 're planning a job ,
 I can 't to this stage determine whether it 's fraud or not .
 Don 't play games with me , lnspector .
 I 'm just an old- fashioned copper . Find the bad guys . Put 'em away .
 Some of us have to get our hands dirty .
 And that 's how you intend to conduct the case , is it ? Get dirty ?
 If I have to .
 I will not have this department brought into disrepute .
 Everything gets done by the book , the same book I 'll be throwing at you if I find out you 've been cutting corners .
 Yes , Ma 'am .
 I mean it , lnspector .
 You have to catch him with the cash in his hand .
 Any room for doubt and you 'll end up embarrassing us all .
 Oh , I 'll catch him , Ma 'am . I guarantee it .
 OK , so our new mark is Linda Runcorn .
 The story is that she 's the CEO of an online restaurant and hotel guide .
 It 's got a huge tourist readership , so it 's very influential .
 However , excellence is not the best way to guarantee a good review .
 The larger chains escape , but she tells the smaller hotels and family restaurants that if they don 't make it worth her while , she 'll put them out of business .
 - Worth her while by handing over cash ? - Precisely .
 The smaller hotels and restaurants survive on reputation .
 She operates on fear , and once she 's got hold of you , she bleeds you dry .
 Character traits ? A bully .
 She sucks up to the bigger chains , while bullying the smaller clients who can 't afford to fight back . Nasty .
 - What 's our way in ? - Her mum 's family , the Toppings .
 Had a bit of land and a noble line going back centuries , but they cut off her grandmother , Helen Topping , without a penny when she married a builder .
 Seems the family thought he was beneath her .
 But to this day , Linda wears a bracelet given to her by her Grandmother which bears the Topping family crest .
 So what 's the game ? An inheritance scam ?
 Yeah . We use a long- lost relative Linda 's never heard of .
 One of the Toppings . A maiden aunt who died without making a will ,
 leaving behind an estate which Linda is the sole heir to .
 Which just happens to be worth a small fortune . Exactly .
 Yeah , I 'm here . I 'll call you when I 'm done .
 - Miss Runcorn ? - Yes .
 Hello . I 'm Holly Patterson , Greyshot Genealogy .
 I was rather surprised to get your letter .
 - Oh ? - How did you find me ?
 - The voting register . - Did I ask for water ?
 For heaven 's sake , just put it down . We 'll call you when we want something .
 They fuss all over you , then when you actually want something , when you want to actually order something , they 're nowhere to be bloody seen .
 Quite .
 So , what 's this potentially exciting news exactly ?
 Well , every few months , the Treasury releases a list of estates that are intestate .
 - That means ... - People who died without leaving a will .
 Yes .
 Yes .
 You 're one of those bloody heir hunters , aren 't you ?
 Oh , well , we prefer probate investigators .
 All the same thing , like ambulance chasers .
 I can 't imagine what you found on my father 's side , they didn 't have two pennies to rub together .
 What is it ? A tin bath ?
 Well , actually , it 's a relative on your mother 's side .
 - Oh . My mother 's side ? - Yes , the Toppings ...
 Now , this is your great- aunt Irene .
 Irene Topping . Excuse me .
 Sorry , I just need to check this .
 She 's the sister of your maternal grandmother .
 Now , your great- aunt passed away .
 She was childless , she never married and she didn 't leave a will .
 So her estate passed to the next in line .
 - Which is you . - Me ? - Yes .
 It appears so .
 Well , I don 't suppose there 's anything to get too excited about .
 I never really believed all those rumours about my mother 's aristocratic family .
 The old bag probably left me a tatty old armchair and some cats .
 Well , she actually left you jewellery and property worth in the region of £4 . 7 million .
 And , as far as we can tell , you are the sole heir .
 Well , that 's different .
 I mean , obviously , I am devastated about poor old Great- Aunt Irene .
 But ... Sorry , did you say 4 . 7 million ?
 - I did . - O- M- G.
 Well , it was a pleasure to meet you .
 You 'll be hearing from us soon . Bye- bye .
 Yeah , it 's me . Done .
 - Hook , line and sinker . - OK , good . See you back here .
 Well ?
 Some old rubbish about an old aunt leaving her a fortune .
 All right , stay on it .
 Katherine Farmer .
 We haven 't seen you for a while .
 Still picking pockets ?
 No idea what you 're banging on about , mate .
 Really ?
 You going to tell me what I 'm doing here , or what ? You know this man ?
 Don 't ring any bells .
 Sean Kennedy . Never seen him before .
 Really ? Let me jog your memory .
 We found this with your stuff .
 That ain 't mine . Intent to supply Class- As .
 You can 't stitch me up like that . Can 't I ? I want to see a brief .
 This isn 't your first offence , is it , sweetheart ?
 It 's not going to be three months , out in a fortnight .
 You 'll do serious time for this . Now look at the picture again .
 Sean Kennedy .
 All right . I may have seen him knocking about .
 It was more than that , wasn 't it ?
 Used to run around together , get into scrapes .
 We was just kids .
 I don 't see him any more .
 What happened ? His sister put a stop to it ?
 Didn 't want a nasty little pilferer
 like you horning in on their double act ? It weren 't like that . Whatever .
 I think it 's time you and Sean got reacquainted .
 Why ? I 'm going fishing , and you 're my bait .
 Do I look like a maggot ? You 'll infiltrate this gang he 's joined and report back to me .
 No . I ain 't no grass .
 I see you 've had a little girl .
 What is she now ? Two ?
 Be a shame . Drug- dealing mum locked up , kid put into care ...
 You leave her out of this .
 She 's be a teenager when you got out .
 Wouldn 't even know you . She 'd be with a new mum .
 - You can 't do this . - I 'm a police officer , sweetheart ,
 I can pretty much do anything I want .
 Now , you do what I 'm telling you , or your brat will be in a foster home in time for her tea .
 What 's this here , a family crest ?
 The Topping family . We need an exact match .
 By tomorrow , you said ?
 - Can it be done ? - It 's not easy . You have to get the stone right .
 The shape and the clarity , and the way the light dances off the ...
 - Hmm . That 's odd . - Something wrong ?
 Not at all , but you might want to rethink a replica .
 - Why ? - Because if this is what I think it is , a replica won 't stand up to any serious scrutiny .

 It 's fine with the naked eye , but if she gets it authenticated ...
 What ?
 - What is it , Bob ? - Cushion- cut , 20- carat , azure stone .
 If I 'm not mistaken , we are looking at a 150- year- old Kashmir sapphire .
 Well , that sounds expensive .
 It 's hard to tell from a snap , but if this is the real thing , it could be 20- 30 grand .
 It won 't stand up to close scrutiny , but I 'll get you the replica by tomorrow , all right ?
 Cheers .
 Bloody hell . You spilled my shampoo , you clumsy ....
 Oh , I 'm so sorry . Watch the suit , will you ? It 's a nice one , then ?
 I said get your grubby mitts off my threads .
 Now tootle off back to your caravan . There 's a dear .
 Get me another bottle .
 She 's stolen my wallet . Stop that girl .
 Police . What you talking about ? I ain 't done nothing .
 Hey . What 's going on here ? City of London Police .
 - What seems to be the problem ? - This geezer is sexually harassing me .
 I wouldn 't touch you with a jack hammer , love .
 Both of you calm down . Sir , why don 't you explain to me what 's happened ?
 This grotty little chav stole my wallet .
 Do you want a smack , cheese breath ?
 I want her to turn out her pockets right now .
 I want my money back .
 And I want you to calm down . I 'm not going to warn you again , sir .
 Do as he says . Empty your pockets .
 - It 's not there . - Well , are you sure it 's missing , sir ?
 Yes . I keep it inside my jacket .
 Why don 't you check your other pockets ?
 I don 't see why , I don 't keep ...
 I think you owe this young lady an apology , don 't you ?
 - I 'm sure she ...
 - Oh , come on , then , apologise .
 Sir .
 - I 'm most terribly sorry . - Yeah , well , up yours , creep .
 No , seriously , did you see that guy 's face ?
 When I accused him of sexually harassing me ,
 I thought he was going to puke .
 What happened to you ?
 Kat Farmer used to be the best in the business .
 Used to be able to steal anything , and you got caught nicking a wallet .
 Come on , girl !
 Who says I wanted his wallet ?
 Whoa , nice .
 Shit .
 - You know , I never thought I 'd see you again . - Why 's that ?
 You 're in this fancy new crew now . I 'm still nicking watches .
 I might have moved on , but I haven 't changed .
 I 'll never forget what you did for me .
 Yeah , well , I ain 't a grass . I know .
 I was worried about you in there .
 It weren 't that bad . Regular meals every day . A roof over my head .
 It 's good that you were worried though .
 You ain 't done so bad for yourself , have you ? Well , you know ...
 I got a little girl now .
 What ?
 Yeah , she 'll be three next month .
 I can 't believe you 're a mum .
 Dad 's a bit of a waste of space though , I ain 't seen him in two years .
 I 'm sorry to hear that . Don 't be . Like I said , he 's a waste of space .
 Look , Sean , now you 're all sorted , I could really use a leg up .
 Uh ?
 There must be some little job I can do in that fancy crew of yours ?
 Sweep up ? Make the tea ?
 Stand there and look pretty ?
 Kat , it 's not really that ...
 I 'll get Mum to look after Laurel for a bit .
 Truth is , Sean , I 'm really skint .
 Oh . No . I don 't want your charity , you know me better than that .
 I want to work for it .
 Ash sent these over from the printers .
 These are fake title deeds to a 30- acre pile in Northumberland .
 Great .
 And documents showing all the debts still owed to the estate .
 Fantastic . Hey , guys .
 - Sean , what the hell are you ... ? - I see you 've brought company .
 All right ? I 'm Kat .
 Like your gaff . This all from grifting then ?
 - All right , Emms ? Long time no see .
 - Kat .
 - Wow . Look at you , all glammed up . - Look , she 's an old friend , OK ?
 I said she could help out with a job .
 She used to hang around with me and Emma back in the day .
 She just needs a leg up , that 's all .
 It 's one job , and I 'll pay her from my share .
 Are you serious ? I mean , I 'm sorry , this is nothing personal ...
 I can vouch for her and so can Emma .
 That aside , I owe her . She kept me from going to prison .
 - That was a long time ago , Sean . - That 's what I said .
 It makes no difference .
 I was 15 , and she could have seriously reduced her sentence if she 'd grassed me up , but she didn 't .
 You two , of all people , should respect that .
 How many of your old friends have turned up ?
 And we 've taken care of every single one of them .
 Kid 's got a point .
 - Emma ? - Oh , she 's a train crash .
 But she 's all right .
 OK . We 'll work her into the con .
 - Looks like she 's in , Guv . - All right . Stay on it .
 So tomorrow , Emma goes to see Linda and reveals the news about the debts owed on the estate .
 OK .
 But before she starts asking questions , show her the bracelet .
 Yeah , there might be an issue with that .
 An issue ?
 Seedy Bob says the sapphire on the bracelet might be a rare Kashmir sapphire , and very hard for Bob to forge .
 - So if she gets it authenticated ...
 - Yeah . They 'll spot it .
 What if we do a switch ?
 What , swap Linda 's bracelet for Seedy Bob 's replica ?
 Yeah . So she gets her own bracelet authenticated .
 What if she compares the two ?
 No , no , apparently , the replica will look the same to the naked eye .
 It 's only if she gets it examined that there 's a problem .
 Even if that 's true , it 's still a tricky manoeuvre .
 Not for Kat . She could easily swap the fake bracelet for the real one .
 Seriously , guys . It makes perfect sense . It 's what she specialises in .
 She could do that switch with her hands tied behind her back .
 Well , it is what I do . Kat can go along as Emma 's assistant ,
 Emma can distract Linda and Kat can move in for the kill .
 It makes sense .
 Lovely morning . It was .
 And there was me thinking this was the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
 Yeah , well , think again .
 So what have you got for me ?
 They 're conning some bird .
 Linda Runcorn . An inheritance scam , I know all that .
 Tell me something I don 't know .
 They 've got this fake bracelet that proves it 's legit , or something ...
 Except there 's a snag .
 They think that the sapphire in the bracelet might be from Kashmir .
 Could be worth a few quid . Maybe more than a few quid .
 So they 're worried this Linda might get it valued ?
 Yeah . They want me to help Emma do the switch .
 I nick the real one and put the fake one back on her wrist .
 So , Runcorn gets her own valued , thinks the whole thing 's kosher .
 All right . Do what they want for now .
 Keep reporting back to me . And one other thing .
 I want you to slip this in Emma Kennedy 's case . No way .
 They 've been all right by me so far . I 'm not doing that .
 OK , no ? If you don 't want to do it , that 's fine .
 - If you don 't feel like it . - I 've done what you asked .
 But we 're not finished , are we ?
 I make one call to Social Services , tell them you 've been arrested for dealing in Class- A drugs , they 'll pick your kid up within the hour .
 You want me off your back ? Then do as you 're told .
 At the end of this , you 'll never have to set eyes on me again .
 Well , here are the deeds to your aunt 's estate .
 And here 's a picture of the house in Northumberland .
 - It 's a nice gaff . - Yes . Thank you , Miss Hunter .
 I 've just got to tell you about a slight problem before we continue .
 Problem ?
 Well , as you can see from the house there , it 's a couple of centuries old , and a few years ago ,
 - it started suffering rom subsidence . - Nasty . My nan had that .
 Yes .
 Your great- aunt Irene , she had to get builders in , and apparently , now , they 're claiming that they haven 't been fully paid .
 Can I , er , get some water ? Hmm ?
 A glass of water .
 I 'm not being funny , but it feels like a family of badgers just moved in .
 - How much are they owed ? - Sorry ? These builders .
 - How much are they owed ? - Oh . Yes .
 Er , 100, 000 .
 One hundred grand ? For subsidence ?
 Well , it is a massive house . And very old .
 And as the builders are threatening court action , they will need to be paid before the transaction can be completed .
 Why ? Sorry ?
 I mean , why before ? Can 't the debts be absorbed by the estate ?
 Well , it could be , I suppose , but time is of the essence .
 The builders are threatening to force the estate into administration over these unpaid bills .
 You can 't imagine how complicated that would make things .
 The legal fees alone would treble what you owe the builders and it could mean that you wouldn 't see your inheritance for five years .
 I see . And you 're sure it 's my aunt ?
 Sorry , am I sure ? I 'm not going to suddenly find there 's been a mix- up ?
 Not if I 've done my job properly , no .
 I don 't remember having a Great- Aunt Irene .
 And I don 't want to fork out 100, 000 and then find out I 'm paying somebody else 's bloody bills .
 I am quite sure that it is your aunt .
 Actually , one of the items that she left was a sapphire bracelet , very much like the one you 're wearing .
 A bracelet ?
 Have you got it ?
 Yes . Show me . If you could ...
 It 's just somewhere down here ...
 Oh . Oh , my God . Oh , I 'm so sorry .
 It 's fine .
 I 'm always doing this .
 Mum says I could start World War ill , I 'm so accident prone .
 It 's fine . I can manage .
 Miss Hunter , why don 't you give Miss Runcorn the bracelet now ?
 Well , it certainly looks authentic .
 Yes , and it has the crest , and everything .
 I 'll have to get it authenticated .
 But if it 's all above board , I 'll sign the papers and pay the debts .
 That 's great . Great . You won 't regret it .
 You said we have to move quickly . Yes . How quickly ?
 Well , it would help if you paid the debts in cash .
 Cash ? I 'm not sure . They are builders .
 Well , if it 'll oil the wheels a little , then so be it .
 Great . Great .
 That was good work . Thank you .
 Leg it . Leg it .
 Kat .
 Can I help you , officer ?
 Oi .
 Guv .
 Put her in the car . That 's not mine .
 That 's not mine . I can walk there myself ...
 No .
 I don 't know what happened , they just came out of nowhere .
 How did she get drugs on her , Kat ?
 Emma doesn 't even do drugs .
 They weren 't mine , if that 's what you 're asking .
 I went with her , I did what you asked me to do , and then we went outside and ...
 Kat 's right . It 's not her fault . Something else must be going on .
 The cops must have planted the gear on Emma . I 'm so sorry , Sean ...
 She 's at the Barber Street station .
 She was arrested by Detective lnspector Fisk .
 Sid Fisk ? You know him ? Yeah , he 's bent as a nine bob note .
 This is how he operates . He frames people and then bangs them up .
 Well , it 's ridiculous .
 What does Fisk want with Emma ?
 This can 't be just about Emma . It 's about all of us .
 I 'm going to see her . On my own . Meet me at Eddie 's in an hour .
 Ahem ...
 Excuse me . Roger Wyles , senior partner , Wyles , Clark and Foster .
 I 'm representing Emma Kennedy .
 If I am delayed from seeing my client in any way whatsoever , there will be a serious complaint made to the IPCC .
 - Take this gentleman down to cell four , please . - Thank you .
 - Fisk . - 'Sir , Stone 's come to see her . '
 - Miss Kennedy . Roger Wyles . Your solicitor .
 - Yeah , of course .
 I have no idea what happened . It 's all right . It doesn 't makeany sense .
 It 's OK , it 's OK , we 'll work it out . How 's Sean ?
 He 's OK . Except he wants to drive a JCB into the building .
 Good plan . Needs fine tuning .
 Yep . I 'll get you out of here , OK ? I 'll think of something .
 - We won 't go further with the con on Linda , we 'll figure it out . - No .
 - Emma ... - No , I don 't want you to do that , right ?
 We 've come too far . When she gets the bracelet authenticated ...
 No , no , no , no , stop , stop . Think a minute .
 Look at what happened . Look at where you are .
 Yes . And it would feel a whole lot worse if it was all for nothing .
 We 've done the switch . We 've shown her the paperwork .
 All that 's left to do now is collect .
 It 'd be crazy to back out now .
 I 'll keep .
 He 's got some front coming in here , I 'll give him that .
 You want me to nick him , Guv ?
 - For what ? - Impersonating a brief ?
 Nah . I 'm going to make him an offer he can 't refuse .
 For the girl ?
 You 're learning , sergeant .
 I thought you wanted Bricks banged up . At all costs , you said .
 He will be .
 The thing is , he 's a clever boy , that 's why no- one 's got him in the past .
 You can 't beat him at his own game .
 So I 'll play him at mine .
 Nice and simple , no way out .
 When he accepts my offer and hands over the cash ,
 I 'll get him for attempting to bribe a police officer .
 Time 's up .
 Hello , Michael .
 Fancy a coffee ?
 She 's doing my nut in .
 Emma 's a tough cookie . She 'll be OK .
 She 's not going to be OK . Not unless we do something .
 Like what ? Boost her from the cop shop ?
 Let 's just wait until we hear what Michael says .
 Try not to think about it until we hear from him .
 - I sorted out the bin problem . - Not now , Ed .
 They 're refurbishing the block next door , so they 've got a skip , so I just bung the bags over the wall .
 It 's not permanent , but a bloke thinks it 'll be there six months .
 It 's not a great time , Eddie .
 Sorry , mate . I thought you might be interested , you know , as mates .
 Yeah , well , we just hit a bit of a bump in the road . Oh , right .
 Where 's Em ?
 - It 's Kat , isn 't it ? - Yeah , that 's right .
 So what are you , like , a new member of the crew , or what ?
 I 'm not helping here , am I ?
 Not really , but we 'll be OK , we 'll think of something .
 Yeah , mate , yeah , sure . Of course you will .
 Yeah , sure .
 Emma Kennedy had cocaine with a street value of five grand in her bag .
 She 's looking at intent to supply and a pretty hefty sentence .
 It 's funny how you know the exact value .
 Pay for it yourself , did you ?
 I 'm sure I don 't know what you 're suggesting , Michael .
 Do you know , I have a lot of respect for the police . I do .
 They have a job to do and I 'm fair game , and if they can catch me , then no hard feelings .
 But a bent cop ? Someone who 's not interested in catching criminals , just lining his own pocket .

 That 's got to be the lowest of the low .
 Spare me the honour amongst thieves bullshit , Stone .
 I couldn 't be less interested in what you think of me .
 Then what are you interested in ?
 They told me you were a bright boy . Spell it out for me .
 Fifty grand and the girl walks .
 - 50 grand cash . - Shouldn 't be too steep for you . The great Mickey Bricks .
 How do I know I can trust you ?
 You don 't .
 But as far as I can see , you don 't have much choice , do you ?
 You 've always got a choice .
 And my grandmother always told me , never make deals with fools or bent cops .
 You 're making a big mistake , Stone .
 How is she ? She 's a little shaken up , but she 's coping .
 - Is she angry with me ? - No , mostly , she 's angry with herself .
 I think we 've sat here like lemons for long enough .
 - Let 's go and help her . - I 'm working on it . - Not hard enough .
 - Sean .
 No , I 'm sorry , Albert , I just want to do something .
 This is what Fisk wants , us losing our focus .
 That 's why he planted the coke on Emma .
 We have to keep our heads in what we 're doing .
 Not get distracted .
 - Carry on with the con ? - Yes , all the ground work 's been done .
 We can wrap it up quickly .
 - We may even need the money to get Emma back . - He 's right .
 Now , we just have to be extra vigilant .
 Cover our backs every possible way .
 If Linda 's on , we can arrange a time and a place for the money exchange that we control .
 It 's what Emma wants us to do . She said that , did she ?
 Yes . She 's got Linda exactly where we want her .
 Agreed ?
 Yeah , agreed .
 Yeah .
 Sean ?
 Fine .
 Hello , Linda Runcorn ?
 My name is Sheldon Greyshot , Greyshot Genealogists .
 Yes , I 'm afraid Miss Patterson has been taken ill , so I 'll be dealing with your case from now on .
 We need you to sign some paperwork , at your earliest convenience .
 Are you going to let Emma go ? What 's it to you ?
 She 's my friend . You 're breaking my heart .
 Now , are you going to tell me what I need to know , or do you want to share a cell with her ?
 - They 're arranging a meet . - Which will be where ?
 I don 't know . They won 't tell me . They 've all clammed up .
 You nicking Emma has freaked them out .
 What about the woman ?
 Linda Runcorn . They must be telling her .
 Yeah , but she ain 't going to tell me , is she ?
 No , she isn 't .
 Detective lnspector Fisk . This is DS Loach .
 Can we come in ?
 Con men ?
 Did they suggest there were any outstanding charges on your aunt 's estate ?
 Mortgage payments , legal fees ?
 Yes .
 One hundred thousand for subsidence .
 I was about to give it to them as well . In cash .
 I don 't believe it .
 - So there 's no estate ? - No estate . No dead relative .
 - No nothing .
 - And I 'm afraid the bracelet they gave you ... - What about it ?
 Well , we 're going to have to take it with us .
 It 's evidence .
 I spoke to them yesterday .
 They said they were going to come and collect me later today .
 - Did they give you an address ? - No . I didn 't think to ask .
 - Did they say what time you were being picked up ? - Two o 'clock . - Great .
 - We 'd like you to keep that appointment . - Excuse me ?
 I want you to go along , sign the papers , and hand Michael Stone the money , just as planned .
 - Are you mad ? - It is essential that we catch him with the cash in his hand .
 - My cash ? - Yes . - Have you lost your mind ?
 There 'll be a team of police officers with us .
 We 'll be with you every step of the way . There 's no risk at all .
 No risk to you , no . It 's not your money , is it ?
 You don 't even know where they 're bloody taking me , do you ?
 No , but I can assure you ...
 And I can assure you the £100, 000 is going back into my bank .
 I 'm sorry , I don 't mind helping you catch these people , but I will not risk my life savings .
 And you have no right to ask me to do so .
 You 've got two minutes . Thanks .
 Sean , what are you doing here ?
 Fisk . - Her brother 's turned up .
 Look , you shouldn 't have come .
 Well , I had to . Nobody else is doing anything .
 Mickey 's acting like it 's just a little inconvenient hitch in his master plan .
 That 's just the way he deals with stuff .
 He doesn 't let his emotions get in the way .
 That 's because he doesn 't have any emotions .
 Oh , Sean , come on . Don 't be stupid .
 I 'm not being stupid , when are you going to realise you 're in trouble ?
 You have to trust Mickey , OK ? We both do .
 He 'll come up with something . He always does .
 Yeah ? What if he doesn 't this time ?
 Little family reunion , Seany ?
 Excuse me ?
 Detective lnspector Fisk . My pals call me Sid .
 How is Emma ?
 Still acting tough ?
 Are you the copper that set my sister up ?
 Yeah , I am . And I can make it stick too .
 I have this network of people , you see , all willing to state that they bought Class- A drugs from your big sister .
 Come on , then . Come on .
 I 'm not entirely sure how it would help your sister , but it might be fun all the same .
 Come on .
 No ? Smart boy .
 See , what I don 't understand is why Mickey wasn 't interested in the deal I offered him .
 - What deal ? - When he was here posing as her brief .
 - You spoke to Mickey ? - Like I said , I offered him a deal .
 Fifty grand and she walks .
 Didn 't seem too much , not for a big crew like your lot .
 He turned me down . You 're lying .
 Oh , what , he didn 't tell you ?
 I 'll get you fifty grand . Sorry , that deal 's closed .
 I 've got another one though . Yeah , and what 's that , then ?
 Linda Runcorn gets picked up at two o 'clock to finish a deal .
 I want to know where you 're taking her .
 Ten minutes after you tell me , I have Emma released .
 You have my word on that .
 If you don 't tell me , I 'll make sure she gets ten years . Minimum .
 Time to find out if blood 's thicker than money , Seany .
 Need some company ?
 I 'll have what he 's having . Sure .
 You worried about Emms ?
 Yeah , but she 'll be fine , we 've got out of worse scrapes than this .
 Yeah , you have .
 I used to love you and Emms , back in the day , always looking out for each other .
 I had a sister who hated my guts and a mum who was only happy when she was off her face .
 I never had that .
 You 've got your little girl now .
 Yeah . Mum 's better too .
 It 's funny how something so little can turn two people 's lives around .
 It 's hard though ...
 looking out for her , making sure she 's got what she needs , things that I never had .
 I 'm sure you 're a great mum .
 Well , I try my best .
 That 's the thing about family .
 You do whatever you have to to take care of them , keep them safe .
 Yeah , you do .
 And there ain 't nothing wrong with that , is there , Sean ?
 No , there isn 't .
 Inspector Fisk ? It 's Sean Kennedy .
 ' I 'll tell you what you want to know , but I need to see Emma 's free first . '
 You won 't regret this , kid .
 ' Yeah . I 'd better not . '
 You know what you have to do ?
 Just go along with everything until you turn up . Exactly .
 Afternoon . Hello .
 I need to speak to Mr Gayhorse .
 I 'm sorry , we don 't have anyone here by that name .
 I 'm Sheldon Greyshot . Who are you ?
 Oh . I 've got it down as ... Gayhorse . What does that look like to you ?
 Er ... Playhouse .
 Look , it 's Greyshot . It 's obviously a mistake .
 We don 't make mistakes . We can 't afford to .
 We 're from Her Majesty 's Treasury . My name is Farrow and this is Whitman .
 You 're investigating the estate of Marcus Hambury .
 Is there a problem . He 's wanted for tax evasion .
 As you know , any probate investigator 's at liberty to track down the heirs to intestate assets of the deceased , whatever their misdemeanours when living .
 Except in this case , the deceased is alive and well and living in Hove .
 Hove ? Yes , we 're afraid he might have faked his own death to avoid capture .
 So , we 'll need a room and all the documentation you have on the estate .
 Jennifer , get the Hambury file , will you ?
 And show these gentlemen to meeting room one .
 I 've two more associates coming . Please alert me when they arrive .
 Do give their names to the receptionist .
 Here for the Hambury meeting . Ah , yes , upstairs . Thank you .
 Fisk . It 's Sean .
 Miss Runcorn . Let me take you upstairs . We 're on the second floor .
 Get her out . I want to see her .
 You . Out .
 Get off me . Where are they ? Fordham Road .
 Second floor .
 You 've done the right thing , Seany .
 What have you done ? Sean ?
 - What did you do ? - What I had to .
 All units . All units .
 Fordham Road . Now .
 - Second floor ? - Up here . Is everything OK ?
 Michael Stone , I 'm arresting you on suspicion of probate fraud .
 Are you going to paint my portrait later ?
 Just making sure it 's real .
 What 's real ?
 That we just collared the biggest grifter in London red- handed .
 Oh , dear , not looking great , is it , Mickey ?
 Any advice from your grandmother on what to do when you 're caught bang to rights ?
 - Can we just get this over with ? - Should have trusted me .
 You should have accepted my deal when you had the chance .
 Then I wouldn 't have had to get your boy to betray you .
 - Sean ? - That 's right . He 's the one who told me where to find you .
 No , he ... Why would he do ... ?
 Emma 's freedom .
 So you see , I am a man of my word , after all .
 Make a deal with me , I stick to it .
 So ?
 What do you say , Michael ?
 One hundred grand and you can walk .
 One hundred ? It was 50 before .
 I double it for a big cheese like you .
 You see , someone offered me 20 grand to put you away , so I need the right incentive not to do that .
 You get me the cash , this will all just disappear .
 - How ? - I 'll do what I always do when I 'm paid to make a case go away .
 Pollute the evidence , a couple of schoolboy errors in the paperwork , and tell your brief what to look for .
 You 'll be out in an hour .
 That 's got to be worth a hundred grand .
 That 's just what I wanted to hear .
 What are you smiling about ?
 Ma 'am . This is Michael Stone ...
 - Mickey Bricks . - How are you , Michael ? I trust we 've made you comfortable ?
 Well , it 's certainly been interesting .
 Hard to get the staff these days .
 What 's going on here ?
 Michael and I had a little deal .
 You know about deals , don 't you , Sidney ? You 'll appreciate this one .
 It 's very nuanced .
 Michael was in no position to refuse this offer .
 I 've been brought in to clean up this department , by any means necessary .
 Starting with a certain diseased apple called Fisk .
 OK . So , what do you want from me ?
 Simply to do the thing you 're best at .
 You 're a bit stuffed then , ain 't ya ?
 Exactly . It 's a ... a thingy- o ... It 's a paradox ?
 No , no . No , a catch- 22 ?
 No . Chinese puzzle ?
 A conundrum ?
 No . A mystery within a puzzle wrapped up in an enigma ?
 So , what we going to do about Fisk ?
 Hang on . I know that face . He 's got something .
 Michael ? Don 't keep us in suspense .
 A mystery within a puzzle wrapped up in an enigma .
 We 're going to set Fisk a trap . One he 'll fall headfirst into .
 So , Linda Runcorn .
 The story is she 's the CEO of an online hotel and restaurant guide .
 It was a straightforward probate con , really .
 Albert look into the kind of extras you 'd have to pay on an estate like that .
 You know , bills for maintenance , loans to fix the roof , that sort of thing .
 So , what do you think ?
 Yeah , I can make that work .
 We got Jean Kirkpatrick , one of the best grifters north of the Watford Gap to help us out .
 We ensconced her in a Chelsea apartment and gave her a dossier briefing her on the character she was supposed to play for us .
 Linda .
 Nothing worse than a bent copper .
 Now remember , Fisk will have us under surveillance round the clock , so we play this for real .
 Old bag probably left me a tatty old armchair and some cats .
 Well , actually , she left jewellery .
 And property worth in the region of £4 . 7 million .
 We knew your team were watching us .
 No . There 's no way you would 've known I was tailing you . No way .
 Oh , we knew .
 We knew you were coming after us the moment you took our five grand .
 Your five grand ?
 The five grand 's a down payment , there 's another 15 when it 's done .
 The guy who paid you in the bar , Domino Derek , an old poker friend of Albert 's .
 All this . Why ?
 I 'm a good cop .
 - Excuse me ? - OK , I take the occasional backhander , but who doesn 't ?
 I 'm old school . Do you know how many villains I 've put away ?
 The ones who didn 't pay you ?
 So you call me a rotten apple , a disease that needs to be rooted out , then you do deals with con men ?
 That makes you the scab . The Judas .
 Coppers like you were extinct years ago .
 I 'm trying to do honest police work with both my hands tied behind my back .
 Honest ? Planting drugs on people . Taking bribes to let them go .
 We know you threatened Kat Farmer if she wouldn 't spy for you .
 That 's the trouble with being predictable , lnspector .
 It meant we could read you like a book .
 - Yeah . - Wainwright here .
 - I 've got something for you . - Thank you .
 You using Kat actually made our life easier .
 Really ? Well , delighted I could help .
 Emma ? Oh , she 's a train crash . But she 's all right .
 It meant we could feed you the information we wanted you to have more easily .
 What 's this , here ? A family crest ?
 The Topping family . We need it exactly the same .
 By tomorrow , you said ?
 Can it be done ?
 It 's not easy . You have to get the stone right .
 Sean and Emma Kennedy . The newbies .
 These two are Stone 's soft underbelly .
 If we get to them , we can penetrate the inner circle and tear it apart .
 That 's how we get him .
 We knew you were targeting Sean and Emma , so we played along .
 It 's Sean Kennedy .
 I 'll tell you what you want to know , but I need to see that Emma 's free first .
 - You won 't regret this , kid . - Yeah , I 'd better not .
 We told you the bracelet was valuable because we knew you couldn 't resist getting your hands on the extra cash we said it was worth .
 I 'm afraid the bracelet they gave you ...
 - What about it ? - Well , we 're going to have to take it with us .
 You stole a bracelet you thought was worth 50 grand , and used your own money to try and entrap us .
 You know what you have to do ?
 Just go along with everything until you turn up . Exactly .
 He 's dropped off the cash .
 Ash made up an identical package , with fake money and a recording device .
 All we had to do then was switch the envelopes and wait for you to arrest me .
 ' So ? What do you say , Michael ?
 ' One hundred grand and you can walk .
 ' A hundred ? It was 50 before .
 ' I double it for a big cheese like you .
 ' You see , someone offered me 20 grand to put you away ,
 ' so I need the right incentive not to do that .
 ' You get me the cash and this will all just disappear .
 ' How ? I 'll do what I always do when I 'm paid to make a case go away .
 ' Pollute the evidence , a couple of schoolboy errors in the paperwork
 ' and tell your brief what to look for . You 'll be out in an hour .
 ' That 's got to be worth a hundred grand . '
 I was doing my job .
 Sidney Fisk . I 'm arresting you on suspicion of corruption .
 Hang on a minute , I 'm not the villain , here .
 - I 'm not the scumbag . - You do not have to say anything .




 It 's OK , I know . Know what ?
 Everything .
 Fisk , what he made you do .
 It 's all right .
 No , it ain 't . Yes , it is , listen , we 've taken care of it .
 He won 't be bothering you again .
 You must think I 'm such a skank .
 No .
 He said he was going to ... I know .
 She 's all I 've got , Sean .
 Listen , this is about what Fisk did , not you ...
 I know more than anyone , people like us , where we 're from , you know , we take care of our own .
 So we 're all good . OK ?
 In fact ... In fact , we 're better than good .
 - What 's this ? - It 's your cut .
 What ?
 From the con we were working on , the bracelet switch .
 - But ...
 - It 's not charity , OK ? You earned it .
 Sean , I can 't take this .
 I don 't deserve it , not after what I did .
 Yes , you can .
 - I owe you .
 - Call it even .
 Mummy . Hello .
 Laurel , this is Sean , say hello .
 Hiya .
 Take care of yourself , Kat .
 You too , Seany ...
 Michael .
 Come to wave me off ?
 You took a hell of a risk carrying on with the con ...
 You should 've accepted Fisk 's offer in the pub .
 You could have ended it there and then . Well , I was having so much fun .
 You saw an opportunity to relieve Fisk of his cash and you took it .
 That 's what I do . That 's dirty money .
 Made from bribery and corruption , and by rights , it belongs to the Metropolitan Police .
 Yeah , maybe , but we 'll put it to much better use .
 What makes you think I won 't just arrest you for it ?
 You won 't do that . Won 't I ?
 Because then , you 'd have to explain to your superiors how you blackmailed a group of con artists into helping you catch a bent cop .
 Well , they did say by any means necessary .
 We could go and talk them through it now , if you like , you know , while I 'm still here ?
 Goodbye , Chief lnspector .
 Michael .
 This was a one- off . Starting now , the slate 's clean .
 I 'm the law enforcer and you 're the criminal .
 If I can catch you , I will .
 I wouldn 't have it any other way .
 - So , how was she about us keeping Fisk 's money ? - Fine .
 - Fine ? - Yeah , well , she moaned for a bit , then I convinced her it was for the best .

 How was Kat ?
 OK , yeah .
 Can we get back to normal now , please ?
 It didn 't feel right working for the police .
 Give me tinkers and tricksters , and gamblers and fraudsters any time .
 At least you know where you stand with them .
 Ain 't that the truth ?
