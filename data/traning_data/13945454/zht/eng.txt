 - Strawberry flavored .
 - I love berries .
 [ grunts , exhales ]
 [ moans ]
 [ giggling ]
 Can I put it in without a condom ?
 - Hmm ?
 - You know it feels so much better . Please ?
 Okay , okay , okay , okay . Just remember to pull out before you come .
 [ chuckles ] [ moaning ] - Mm- hmm . - Mm .
 Okay ?
 [ song pauses ]
 - Babe ? - Yeah ?
 [ both panting ]
 - Why do you look like Rocky Balboa ?
 - What do you mean ? ... [ both moaning ]
 - I 'm gonna come !
 - [ shouts ]
 Pull out ! Pull out ! Into the tissues .
 Not on the sheets , Malek !
 What the fuck ?
 - Okay .
 - [ moans ]

 [ whimsical music playing ]
 What are you looking at ?
 Your eyebrows look bad today .
 Mm , do you want to smooth 'em out for me ?
 Not particularly , no .
 [ inhales deeply ]
 Well , I was thinking maybe you could stay over tonight .
 Watch a movie .
 Maybe , uh ... [ clears throat ] ... you know ?
 - [ meows ]
 - No , thanks .
 - I 've gotta go home .
 - Oh .
 Ruby , are you sure everything 's all right ?
 Why do you keep asking me that ?
 Well , I have noticed you 're being meaner to me than usual .
 - Like you 're annoyed with me . - What would I be annoyed about ?
 I can 't give you a lift tomorrow , so I 'll just see you at school .
 - Okay ? - Okay .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ door opens ]
 [ door closes ]
 [ Maeve ] That 's really good . Is mine good ?
 [ Elsie ] Yeah , yours is really good .
 Maeve , would you like to stay for dinner ?
 No , thanks .
 - I 've gotta get up early tomorrow . - How come ?
 I have to finish this application for an overseas study thing , and I need to use a school computer , so ...
 Well , why don 't you use mine ?
 No , it 's okay .
 Honestly , it 's fine . Then you can stay for dinner too .
 [ Elsie humming ]
 Okay .
 [ typing ]
 [ sighs ]

 [ exhales ]
 [ computer chimes ]
 Thanks , Anna . I 'll see you and Elsie on Saturday .
 Weren 't you going on a school trip ?
 - Do you need help paying for it ? - No , thanks .
 I don 't need charity .
 Mum ?
 Mum , I can see you . What are you doing here ?
 So , what , you 're besties with her now , are you ?
 No , I 'm not besties with her .
 I 'm just visiting Elsie .
 - What are you doing here ? - Just going for a quick evening run .
 It 's not illegal , is it ?
 You only wear hats when you 're doing something dodgy .
 Fine .
 I walk past the house sometimes to know she 's safe .
 Elsie 's safe here . You don 't need to worry about that .
 That woman 's got a " dance like nobody 's watching " poster .
 She 's clearly a sociopath .
 Do you think Elsie misses me ?
 Course she does .
 You 're her mum .
 She just wants you to get better so you can be together all the time .
 Come on .
 [ sniffles ]
 So what 's happening with this Isaac ?
 I like him .
 It 's none of your business . Stop being so nosy .

 [ Maeve chuckles ]
 [ Dr. Cutton ] So , how has it been living together again ?
 It 's been good .
 No problems .
 Yes , it 's been good .
 We 've been , uh , settling into the new family situation .
 I think it 's a big adjustment for our kids .
 How ... how are they feeling about things ?
 [ sighs ]
 Well , Otis , who 's my son , has a girlfriend , and so he 's very much been asserting his independence from me , and I don 't see him very much anymore , which is a little painful , but I 'm trying to respect his boundaries .

 - And ...
 - [ sighs ]
 And Ola , who 's Jakob 's daughter ,
 I think she might be feeling uneasy around me and the new family setup .
 What is the situation with Ola 's own mother ?
 Oh , she 's dead .
 She ... she passed away a few years ago from cancer .
 And is this loss something you can both talk about openly ?
 [ Jean ] Yes .
 I think we 've talked about it , haven 't we ?
 Yeah , well , I ... I don 't like to dwell on the past too much , but yeah .
 [ exhales ] Well , then we don 't have to do it again , or ... [ both laugh ] Well , that went well ?
 Uh , yeah .
 You do know that therapy isn 't a one- session process , right ?
 - That some people go for years . - [ sighs ]
 Yeah , I 'm sure Dr. Cutton would love to have our money for years .
 - [ laughs ] - Wait . What are you saying ?
 Are you saying that therapy 's just a cynical money- making practice ?
 [ sighs ]
 I 'm not sure I believe in it .
 You don 't believe in therapy ?
 [ Jakob ] Come on .
 I 'm not saying you 're not very good at your job , but I 'm not sure that talking can fix everyone .
 What ? Did I make you upset ?
 You are entitled to your opinion .
 Oh .
 Thank you .
 My God .
 [ car engine starting ]
 ... [ phone chimes ]

 [ exhales ]

 [ exhales ]
 Shit !
 Oh , uh , what 's your favorite food ?
 Food . Uh , lasagne ?
 No , pizza . And fish and chips .
 I like peanut butter on toast , but not too toasted and without crusts .
 That 's incredibly unhelpful .
 Let 's just get takeaway , then .
 [ sighs ]
 [ Colin ] Got much planned for today , compadre ?
 Um ... [ sighs ]
 No . Not really .
 What about you ?
 Oh , I 'll be spending the day pretending I like teaching .
 [ laughs ]
 It 's good to be busy .
 Oh , is that the time ? I better skiddle- skaddle- doo .
 Hey , listen . Why don 't you , me , and Emily have dinner tonight ?
 You can pick up the ingredients today .
 How do you feel about Mexican ?
 I don 't cook .
 It comes in a packet , dude . We 'll cook it .
 You just gotta eat it .
 Okay ? We 're on .
 We 're on like Donkey Kong .
 [ chuckles ]
 Cool .
 Cheers !
 [ upbeat instrumental music playing ]
 [ Otis groans ]
 How come Ruby didn 't drive you in today ?
 I wanted to ride in with my best friend .
 Hmm ?
 You 've had a fight , haven 't you ?
 No . No , not had a fight exactly .
 What did you do ?
 Okay . Um , all right .
 So a few days ago , Ruby said , " I love you , " and I didn 't say it back .
 Oh my God !
 Well , what did you say ?
 I said ,
 " That 's nice . "
 [ laughs ]
 - Hey !
 Hey , hey !
 - Is that bad ?
 Very bad .
 Very , very bad .
 - [ laughs ]
 You said , " That 's nice " ? - Yeah .
 Yeah . Well , I couldn 't lie , Eric .
 And it 's not like I don 't really like her .
 I do , but love is a big word , and I don 't think I 've felt that way about anyone .
 Except Maeve .
 Yes , but that is over .
 I ... I don 't even know if I believe in love .
 It 's all just ... it 's all just a chemical reaction .
 Otis , you 're the most romantic person I know .
 Maybe you just don 't feel that way about Ruby yet , which is fine , but you have to tell her the what ?
 - The truth . - The truth .
 Because the longer you leave it , the more hurt she 'll be .
 Yeah ?
 - Yeah . - Yeah .
 - Yeah . - Come on !
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 I ...
 I was thinking that maybe if I got a B on the test this afternoon , that I might be able to move up a set .
 Fingers crossed , Adam .
 Okay . Um , all right . Come over .
 Uh , remember what I said about how sentences need full stops ?
 - Yeah ? - Yeah .
 Show me here where they would go .
 [ whimsical music continues ]
 [ screams ]
 - What 's happened to your face ? - What 's happened to your face ?
 - Nothing . - Nothing 's happened to my face either .
 Something 's happened to your face , mate .
 - Anwar , your face is hideous . - I know . I look like a crazy fucking mofo .
 - Well , should you go to hospital ? - No , I think it 's just stress hives .
 - What are you stressed about ? - [ shouts ] It 's hard being me .
 Okay ?
 - [ gasps ] - Ruby !
 Want me to carry your bag to SRE for you ?
 Maybe we can have a little chat .
 - You back in the game ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 Ooh la la . Ooh la la . Ooh la la .
 Are you sure that she said she loves you ?
 ' Cause it seems more like she hates you .
 [ Hope ] Attention , everyone .
 I 'm sure you 've read today 's news article with Dr. Jean Milburn .
 " After spending a length of time on the Moordale campus ,
 I realized there is a battle happening for the emotional and sexual health of our teenagers . "
 I don 't know about you , but I am sick of hearing our school 's name being dragged through the mud , which is why I 'm implementing a plan to put a stop to that .
 It starts with a new syilabus for SRE , which will now be called Growth and Development .
 And to put our parents ' and investors ' minds at ease ,
 I want you all to follow these new guidelines precisely .
 That means no one will diverge from the set topics , and no one will talk to students about their private lives .
 The students usually have quite a lot of personal questions .
 School is not a place for personal questions .
 Jobs were lost over inappropriate events that happened on this campus , and I want you all to be protected from that happening again .
 Understand ?
 I 'm off to pregnancy yoga .
 What are you doing ?
 [ exhales ]
 I 'm building a tree house .
 Okay . Why ?
 It will be fun for our baby to play in .
 I made one for my daughters when they were kids , and they loved it .
 It 's okay ?
 Sure .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ bell ringing ]
 [ Jackson ] Viv , wait up !
 - So you 're talking to me again ? - I was never not talking to you .
 I was wondering whether could talk to Hope about setting up something where people could talk about what they need on campus .
 - What kind of thing ? - [ chuckles ] A forum or something .
 People could talk about mental health or gender identity .
 This is how far you 'll go to get a girl .
 - What ? - Person .
 Do you even care about this , or are you trying to get into Cal 's pants ?
 Uh , okay . Look , you were right .
 I didn 't take head boy seriously , okay ? I didn 't care .
 But I wanna be better .
 Okay , um , I 'll think about it .
 All right .
 [ giggles ]
 I just read your story .
 It 's amazing .
 I can 't believe Glenoxi had sex with Starlanza after she ate her mother .
 She 's very complicated .
 Do you think I 've got a chance at winning ?
 Do you think 's the right place for it ?
 I already applied .
 Oh .
 Okay .
 It might not be to everyone 's taste , you know ?
 I think I 've got a pretty good shot .
 I told you , you have to have the perfect timing of the mushroom .
 - How are you getting the perfect timing ? - When you see the blue shell ...
 [ Eric ]
 Wow , Lily , you look normal .
 Your hair looks nice , Lily .
 Yeah , you 're almost pretty .
 What happened to your face ?
 I was giving you a compliment .
 Doesn 't mean we 're friends .
 Did my hair really look that weird before ?
 No .
 I thought it looked really cute .
 [ Viv ] Listen up , everyone .
 If you haven 't paid for the school trip , please see Hope today .
 Mmm .
 [ in bad French accent ] I cannot wait to eat baguettes with you !
 - [ chuckles ] What ? - I 'm being French .
 Oh , okay .
 Um , yeah , I 'm not gonna go on the school trip .
 - Why ? - 'Cause it 's too expensive .
 It 's not that much , is it ?
 It is expensive . My mum freaked out when she saw how much it was .
 - Really ?
 - Yeah .
 [ Viv claps ]
 For today 's SRE class , boys will be in this classroom and girls in this one .
 Can we please form two orderly lines , please ?
 Uh , where do I go ?
 Yeah , I don 't know .
 So Cal wants to know what line they should join .
 Boys in this classroom and girls in this one .
 But I 'm non- binary .
 - I ... I don 't know which line either .
 - Um , wait here . I will ask for you .
 What seems to be the problem ? Other than your uniform again .
 We don 't fit into the description of boy or girl , so where are we supposed to go ?
 You can both go in the girls ' line .
 But I 'm not a girl .
 They 'll be discussing female anatomy , which I 'm sure will be helpful for you .
 So we go to the vagina or penis line . Is that what you 're saying ?
 It 's okay . I ... I don 't wanna cause trouble .
 I 'll go with the girls .
 [ Hope ] Thank you . That 's very helpful .
 Is there anything else , Cal ?
 Mm- hmm .
 This is complete bullshit .
 Be careful , Jackson . Wouldn 't want to see you going down the wrong path .
 - [ VCR button clicks ] - Okay , guys .
 No questions , okay ?
 No questions .
 [ man in video grunts ]



 Sleep for me .

 I 'm here to tell you about how a night of sex ruined my life .
 Did me and my boyfriend use a condom ?
 Yes .
 Did it split ?
 Yes .
 Did my boyfriend tell me ?
 No .

 [ man in video ]

 Um , sir , this video is not talking about safe sex at all .
 It 's just shaming gay people .
 What do flying penises have to do with STls ?
 Remember , we 're not asking questions .
 We 're just watching the video , so ...
 - Why can 't we ask questions ?
 - That 's another question .
 They 're making valid points about this video , which isn 't informative .
 It 's just preaching abstinence and homophobia , which is dangerous , and we 're a bit old for flying penises .
 - Stop saying " penis " to me .
 - You can 't put this on and expect us ...
 Please , you 're disrupting the class .
 Get out .
 - Seriously ? - Yes , seriously .
 Go .
 He can 't say " penis " in sex ed , sir ?
 I 'm sorry , okay ?
 But I could lose my job if I let you all ask me questions .
 Just watch it , please .
 I believe teenagers shouldn 't have sex because sex will ruin your life .
 Forever .
 I went from having dreams to having a six- month- old baby that left me with a leaky bladder and a baggy vagina .
 Sorry , is the boys ' class being taught about pregnancy as well , or is it just us girls ?
 It 's just us , is it ?
 - Very progressive . - [ Hope ] Quiet , Maeve .
 After getting pregnant , I had no choice but to leave school .
 There are always choices .
 - Women do not have to have children . - [ Hope ] Enough !
 [ Maeve ] We shouldn 't be shamed for having sexual desires .
 You make sex sound terrifying , but it doesn 't have to be .
 It can be fun and beautiful and teach you things about yourself and your body .
 You should be telling us how to do that safely .
 Not telling us to refrain because it doesn 't fucking work .
 Okay . Out , now .
 Happily .
 [ door opens ]
 - [ woman ] Right .
 - [ door closes ]
 Now we 're going to watch a video of me giving birth , where you 'll see that I tore from my vagina to my arsehole .
 [ screaming in video ]
 [ gasping , groaning ]
 Oh , your poor vagina !
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 Aren 't you supposed to be in class ?
 Yeah , but my opinions on abstinence weren 't appreciated , so I got kicked out .
 Yeah , me too .
 We need to tell Hope she can 't be teaching this stuff . It 's backwards .
 - She 's not gonna listen .
 - We need to do something .
 Like what ?
 I dunno .
 Maybe we could help people like before .
 You mean take their money ?
 That wasn 't the only thing the clinic was about .
 What else was it about ?
 Anyway , I 'm not getting involved anymore .
 It 's not my problem .
 It 's not your problem ?
 Why ? Because you 're too cool ? You don 't need to care anymore ?
 You didn 't wanna do the clinic either .
 Yeah , you 're right . And now I remember why .
 I 'm going to the library .
 - Okay . Bye . - Bye .
 - Hey !
 - Hey .
 - I 've been looking all over for you .
 - Huh ?
 Uh , do you wanna talk about it ?
 - Nope .
 - [ Jackson chuckles ]
 Let 's get baked .
 Okay .
 Sometimes me and Malek don 't use a condom .
 He pulls out .
 I thought that if something went wrong , I would just get the morning- after pill .
 - That 's okay , right ?
 Yeah , that 's okay . - No , that 's not okay !
 We 've just watched a woman push something the size of a watermelon out of her vagina .
 Nothing 's okay .
 My rash could be syphilis , herpes , or HlV .
 - I think I 'm gonna die .
 - [ gasps ]
 Anwar !
 Okay , we must never have sex again .
 - Agreed . - Understood .
 [ Emily imitating bird call ]
 Um , I could get in trouble for this , but realistically , you 'll have sex again .
 What I just witnessed would make Helen Brook roll in her grave .
 So , for the love of God , please talk about contraception to a sexual health professional .
 There 's a sexual health clinic on Mayfield Road . Mayfield Road .
 Oh . Yeah , thanks .
 Bye .
 - Where the fuck is Mayfield Road ? - Who the fuck is Helen Brook ?
 I think she was an advocate for reproductive rights .
 Ruby , please can we talk ?
 Not now , Otis !
 I 've got to go and protect myself from your penis !
 - There 's a time and a place . - Yeah .
 [ soothing music playing ]
 [ farting ]
 [ short fart ]
 [ yoga teacher ] Okay , ladies .
 Let 's move onto our sides , using a bolster to support your beautiful , blooming bellies .
 [ farts ]
 [ yoga teacher ] Let 's breathe in ...
 And out .
 - [ soothing music swells ] - [ heartbeat pounding ]
 Taking a moment for ourselves .
 [ yoga teacher ]
 [ exhales ]
 Breathe in and out .
 [ yoga teacher ]
 [ music builds to crescendo ]
 Oh .
 [ breathing heavily ]
 You okay ?
 Jakob is building a tree house .
 Pardon ?
 Oh .
 He 's building a tree house for the baby , which is really lovely , right ?
 Yeah , that 's lovely .
 Then why am I feeling like I can 't breathe ?
 You 're just feeling panicky .
 It 's okay . It 's normal .
 I thought this was the right thing to do ... [ sighs ] ... for me , for the baby .
 I didn 't want to raise another child alone , and now I 'm feeling like I 'm losing control .
 And ... [ breathing heavily ]
 ... I think I 've made a really bad decision .
 What makes you think that ?
 Well , we have nothing in common , Maureen .
 Nothing . I mean ,
 I feel like I 'm having a baby with a stranger .
 [ exhales ]
 You know , Michael and I used to have a lot in common .
 Wanted the same things in life .
 Nice house , babies , a dog . [ chuckles ]
 But in the end , we had all those things ...
 But no connection .
 - Jakob adores you .
 - [ groans ]
 I know these changes are scary , but I think that counts for a lot .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 Thank you .
 [ " Stormy Weather " by Etta James playing ]
 I needed that .
 Shall we go back inside ?
 Do we have to ?
 - Stinks of farts in there . - [ chuckles ]
 At least they 're not my farts .
 [ clattering ]

 Sentences need full stops .
 [ exhales ] Sentences need full stops .
 [ boy ] Oi !
 Shut up !
 I 'm trying to concentrate .
 Here are your books , Rahim .
 And the , um ...
 And the poems you wrote me .
 Why did you keep them ?
 I don 't know .
 [ chuckles ]
 Just ...
 No one 's ever written me poetry before .
 I wanted to remember it .
 - Adam doesn 't write you poetry ? - Sorry ?
 [ laughing ]
 Sorry . No , it 's just , um ...
 No , Adam does not write me poetry .
 Well , that 's sad .
 Poetry is magic .
 Abracadabra .
 Heard you were talking about magic .
 [ chuckles ]
 No , we were talking about poetry . - Yeah .
 - Right .
 Eric doesn 't like poetry . That 's why he 's giving you your books back .
 I never said I didn 't like poetry .
 The poet Ariana Brown said about our various selves that they are " all names you wear in harmony . "
 " Until you can 't . "
 Was he taking the piss ?
 I don 't know .
 Why did you say I didn 't like poetry ?
 Well , I didn 't think that you did .
 - Why do you care what he thinks ? - I don 't .
 - Why are you getting upset about it ? - I ... We 're arguing again !
 I think it will be good for us to get some space when I 'm in Nigeria .
 - You wanna get away from me ? - Adam , you are so defensive !
 No , no , no . You just said that you wanna get away from me .
 How am I supposed to feel ?
 - I don 't have the energy to fight . - Fine .
 Don 't , then .

 - Hello , Hope . - Hi .
 I wanted to talk about what happened with the girls ' and boys ' lines .
 Okay .
 I think it made some students feel really uncomfortable .
 Well , I 'm not sure school is supposed to be comfortable .
 I think it 's supposed to be hard .
 And challenging .
 I agree 100 % .
 But I wonder if students might have space to be challenged if they felt we were listening to their concerns .
 Okay . What do you suggest ?
 I was thinking of setting up a student forum to hear direct feedback from students about what they wanna see implemented on campus .
 This shows great initiative , Vivienne .
 I 'll be interested to see what you discover .
 In the meantime ,
 I 'd like you to keep an eye on your peers during the trip .
 - So can I have your number , please ?
 - Yeah .
 I 'll text you .
 Okay .
 Great .
 [ door closes ]
 Okay .
 Ah , Maeve .
 Have you calmed down since your little outburst in Growth and Development ?
 Well , what was being taught is bollocks .
 That spirited energy would be better channeled into your education , especially if we 're going to find the funding for the GTlP .
 Sorry for saying bollocks .
 You wanted to see me about the trip ? I can 't go .
 Your fees have been paid .
 By who ?
 It was an anonymous payment .
 Okay .
 I 'm serious about the hair .
 Change it immediately .
 [ indistinct announcement over PA ]
 Oh , Michael .
 How are you ?
 [ chuckles nervously ]
 - I didn 't think you liked Mexican food . - I don 't .
 Not that I 've tried it .
 I 'm just shopping for dinner .
 My friend is cooking ...
 " Fa- jee- tas . "
 [ chuckles nervously ]
 Um ... [ splutters ] It 's pronounced " fajitas . "
 Oh .
 I think you might like them .
 How are you coping with everything ?
 Good .
 I 'm very , very excellent .
 How 's Adam ?
 Why don 't you ask him yourself ?
 I haven 't heard from him , so ...
 I think he 'd appreciate it if you reached out to him .
 You 're his father .
 It 's not too late to fix things , you know ?
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 The pull- out method can lead to unwanted pregnancy if your partner doesn 't pull out in time or sperm gets into your vagina .
 It also puts you at greater risk of getting or transmitting an STl .
 Is your boyfriend putting pressure on you not use a condom ?
 He says it makes it feel better for him .
 How does it feel for you ?
 Like I can 't enjoy the sex ' cause I 'm scared of getting pregnant .
 Well , that 's no good for anyone , is it ?
 - [ Olivia sighs ] - Now , tell me .
 [ nurse ] Do you engage in unprotected sex ?
 Every film I 've seen with a gay person ends with them having sex and dying of AlDS .
 I don 't wanna die . So , yeah , I always use a condom .
 So long as you and your partner , or partners , are practicing safer sex , getting tested regularly , you 're very unlikely to contract HlV .

 There 's a medication now called PrEP that protects people from contracting HlV if they are engaging in frequent casual sex in situations that might be putting them at high risk .
 And for those that do contract the virus , there 's medicines now that enable them to live a long and healthy life , even get to the stage where the virus is undetectable , which means it can 't be passed on to somebody else .

 So , I don 't think you 're gonna be dying for a while yet .
 Now have you changed your diet recently or used any new detergents ?
 No .
 What about new condoms or lube ?
 [ phone chimes ]

 Well , apparently , I 'm allergic to strawberry- flavored condoms . Mm- hmm .
 And my boyfriend 's a dickhead .
 You gonna dump him ?
 No . I still love him , annoyingly .
 Um , does he love you ?
 Yeah . Of course he does .
 Ruby Matthews . You can come in now .
 Otis doesn 't love me .
 What do you mean ?
 I told him that I loved him , and he didn 't say it back .
 What did he say ?
 He said , " That 's nice . "
 - [ Anwar ] What a dickhead . - Everyone loves you .
 I know . That 's why I 'm so confused .
 I think I 'm in the wrong place .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 I couldn 't decide which of your favorite meals to make , so I made them all .
 Well , Joe did , but , um ...
 I 'm really trying here .
 I can see that .
 These chips are cold .
 Well , you were late .
 Yeah , well , I was cutting my hair .
 New school rules .
 - Looks nice . - Thanks .
 I think Anna paid for my France trip without telling me .
 - So you 're going ? - I don 't need charity from anyone .
 Maeve , don 't be proud . Just go on the trip .
 Don 't tell me what to do .
 So you 're still angry at me , then ?
 That would be a lot easier ...
 Than liking me ?
 Yeah , than liking you .
 But you also fucked up .
 Why did you do it ?
 I was threatened .
 You just get me .
 Like , we 've both been through so much of the same shit .
 You understand me like nobody else does .
 I didn 't wanna give that up .
 Well , I feel the same .
 I 'm truly , truly sorry .
 Can ...
 Nothing .
 You wanna know what I can feel ?
 Yeah .
 [ Maeve chuckles ]
 Well , I can 't feel anything below my level of injury .
 Um ...
 If you put your hand on my chest , I 'll show you .
 - Okay . - I 'll tell you when .
 There you are .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 I can get hard .
 I just need a little help .
 Not that we 're gonna do that yet .
 So ...
 Would you be able to come or ...
 Yeah .
 Sort of , um ...
 When I get touched in the places that I can feel ...
 It can get a little intense .
 [ chuckles ]
 So ...
 Here ?
 Yeah .
 [ emotional music continues ]
 Please may I take your T- shirt off ?
 There you go . Just like magic .
 - Well , I feel somewhat exposed .
 - [ chuckles ]
 [ clears throat ]
 Now we 're equal .
 Well , where do you like to be touched ?
 [ chuckles ]
 Above the waist .

 - Please may I touch your ears ?
 - [ both chuckle ]
 Yeah .
 [ smoke detector beeping ]
 That would be the other lasagne .
 [ Maeve chuckles ]
 Um ...
 Thanks for inviting me over .
 I 've been wanting to talk because I know why you 're angry with me .
 And I wanted to say I 've been having an amazing time with you , and I do really like you .
 Mm , you like me ?
 Yeah .
 I like you a lot .
 But you don 't love me .
 I just have to say that in my own time .
 And I don 't feel that way right now .
 That 's not to say I won 't .
 I just don 't at the moment .
 I 've never said that to anyone .
 I 'm sorry .
 We haven 't been dating for that long and I don 't know if you actually e love me .
 I introduced you to my dad .
 I 've never introduced anyone to him before .
 Well , we could still keep hanging out like we are .
 [ scoffs ]
 You need to go .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Do you mean go just now or go for good ?
 For good .
 [ door opens , closes ]
 [ sniffles , whimpers ]
 [ kissing ]
 [ Olivia ] One sec .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 - [ groans ]
 Can 't I just pull out ? - Do you wanna have a baby with me ?
 No .
 I mean , not until I 've gone to uni and I 've got a job .
 Mm , yeah . Well , put a condom on , then .
 [ sighs ]
 [ phone chimes ]
 [ " What Cha Get " by Angel and the Mambokats playing ]
 Uh , I gotta go . I gotta go .
 Mm- mmm .
 Oh !
 This is incredible !
 Mm .
 The balance of flavors and the hint of fire .
 It 's so different !
 - How was your day , Michael ? - Bumped into Maureen .
 Mm .
 And she asked me how I was , and we spoke about Adam briefly .
 Mm .
 And then , just as she was leaving , she said something about it never being too late to fix things , and then she touched my arm .
 That 's major ! She wants you back !
 Colin , that 's not our business .
 Unless that 's something you want ?
 Mm . Well , you have to let her know before it 's too late .
 Make a gesture .
 Oh , send her a fruit basket .
 - She 's not in hospital , Colin .
