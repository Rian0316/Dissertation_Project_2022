 We are so in luck !
 Treeger said we could have all this cool stuff !
 Wait right there . Oh , no .
 I 'm paddling away .

 Really ? We got all this rusty crap for free ?
 This and a bunch of bubble wrap . And some of it is not even popped .
 Could we be more white trash ?
 The One with the Cuffs


 How desperate am l ?
 Good thing Chandler 's not here . He always wins at this game .
 I just told my mom I 'd cater her party .
 - How come ?
 - I need the money .
 It 'd be a great way to get rid of that last smidgen of self- respect .
 I think this is a good thing .
 Mom wouldn 't have hired you if you weren 't good .
 You don 't have to stick up for her . She can 't hear you .
 Do you have any juice ?
 Just pickle . Funny story .
 I bumped into Joanna yesterday . My boss , Joanna ?
 That must have been awkward .
 Actually , she asked me if I wanted a drink .
 You didn 't say yes to that , did you ?
 Hello , Rachel .

 Well , not at first .
 What is she doing here ?

 Last time you went out with her you said she was a dud !
 I judged her too quickly . This time , we took it to the next level .
 Last time I almost got fired . You must end it . You must end it now .
 It 's not an everyday occurrence !
 Usually I 'm in there by myself .
 Promise .
 - Rachel , aren 't you running late ?
 - No
 - You are if you pick me up a bagel .
 - Okay .
 Promise you will end this now .
 - I promise .
 I 'll end it . - Thank you .
 I hope you know what I 'm giving up .
 She 's not just the boss in your office . You know what I mean ?
 Sorry . I knew what he meant .
 How 's the hired help ?
 Doing great . Quiches are coming along .
 What 's this ? Blue nail polish ?
 I thought it was cute .
 It 's what your grandmother 's hands looked like when we found her .
 Let me ask you a question .
 Why did you hire me ?
 Richard raved about the food at his party ... ... but you were sleeping with him .
 Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was nice .
 I assume you didn 't sleep with anyone there .
 At least that would be something . Oh , my God !
 Did you hear that ?
 She hired me because she thinks I 'm good .
 I didn 't hear that .
 She didn 't hire me out of pity .
 It wasn 't so she could pick on me . She actually thinks I 'm good .
 And hey , it 's cool if you 're a lesbian .
 Good afternoon . Are you the decision- maker of the house ?
 Do you currently own a set of encyclopedias ?
 No , but try the classifieds . People sell everything in there .
 Actually , I 'm not buying . I 'm selling .
 Let me ask you one question .
 Do your friends ever have a conversation ... ... and you just nod along , not sure what they 're talking about ?
 I 'm telling you , it 's totally unconstitutional .
 I think he deserves a Nobel Prize .
 It was like the Algonquin kids ' table .
 Excuse me . I 'm sorry .
 You haven 't said anything for about two minutes .
 Are you at all interested ? Come on in .

 - That 's weird . - What ?
 Your nails .
 I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn 't give me grief about biting them .
 I meant , it 's weird that you only have nine now .
 Oh , my God !
 Wait a minute .
 I had them when I put
 Oh , my God ! It 's in the quiche ! - Oh , my God !
 - Okay , don 't panic .
 I 'll go buy you a new set of nails .
 No one will know , and you 'll look great !
 It 's because they 're going to eat That 's the problem .
 Honey , don 't bite your nails .
 Please don 't freak out .
 There 's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups .
 And there 's no way to know which one .
 And whoever finds it wins the prize !
 I 'm not freaking out .
 - Why are you laughing ? - Now your father owes me $5 .
 You bet I 'd lose a nail ?
 Don 't be silly . I just bet that I 'd need these .
 Frozen lasagnas ?
 You bet that I 'd screw up ?
 All that stuff about how I was good
 No , that was all true .
 This was just in case you " pulled a Monica . "
 You promised Dr. Weinberg you 'd never use that phrase .
 Come on . Have a sense of humor .
 You 're never able to laugh at yourself .
 That 's right .
 My mom has no faith in me ! That 's hilarious !
 I don 't get it . No .

 I have faith .
 No .
 You have lasagnas !
 The ruined quiches are ready !
 - I really don 't think we should be doing this .
 - Okay .
 It just doesn 't feel like we 're breaking up .
 No , we are . I 'm sad .
 Can you wait till tomorrow ? All right . Unbelievable !

 Thanks .
 That was my boss . I have to go .
 What are you doing ?
 - I 'm getting dressed .
 - Why ?
 When I walk outside naked , people throw garbage .
 Wait . I want to show you something .
 What is it ?
 Just a little gag gift somebody gave me .
 Put your hands together .
 You 're not the boss of me .
 Yeah , you are .

 Saucy !
 I 'll be back in two minutes .
 You 're going to leave me like this ?
 Knowing you 're here waiting for me . I think it 's exciting , don 't you ?
 If you don 't come back soon ... ... there 's pretty much nothing I can do about it !

 I brought you back a macaroon .
 Great . I 'll keep it in my butt with your nose .
 That 's weird . She locked the door .
 You know why ? She 's got the bonus list in there .
 I saw her working on it today .
 Swear you won 't tell .
 When Mark left , he gave me a key to her office .
 You want to see the list ?
 How are you ?
 Hello , Joanna office .
 I 'm sorry .
 I 'll be a little longer . - How little ?
 - A couple hours . This isn 't funny .
 Get back here now ! - I can 't ! - Why not ?
 I 'm in my boss ' car .
 - What ? - Tunnel !

 What ?
 Rachel , could I see you for a moment ?

 Okay , here 's the situation . The keys to the cuffs are on the door .
 Could you be a doll ... ... and grab them and scoot on over here and unlock me ?
 And on a totally separate subject , that 's a lovely pantsuit .
 You promised you would break up with her .
 I did break up with her !
 She just took it really , really well ! Jeopardizing my career never entered your mind ?
 It did enter my mind .
 But then something happened that made it shoot right out .
 You got yourself into those cuffs , you get yourself out .
 I can 't get myself right out of them .
 You must have me confused with the " Amazing Chandler " !
 Unlock me !
 She could be gone for hours , and I 'm cold and ....

 All right !
 This is it !
 Never see her again .
 Never !
 - Never come in here again .
 - Fine !
 Give me back my Walkman !
 I never borrowed it .
 Then I lost it . Buy me one !
 You got it !
 Here we go !
 Come on . This is great ! Does it hurt ?

 No , I always see guys do this when handcuffs are taken off .
 Hello , sweet pants ! Wait !
 What will you tell Joanna ?
 About what ?
 She 'll see you 're gone and know I let you out , and I 'll get fired !
 I 'll tell a lie ! I 'm good at lying !
 I actually did borrow your Walkman !
 She 'll know I have a key to her office .
 I 've got to lock you back up .
 I don 't think so .
 This is much better .
 Here 's somebody interesting .
 What do you know about Van Gogh ?
 - He cut off his ear . - And ?
 I 'm out .
 He painted that . That 's pretty nice .

 I thought he cut off his ear because he sucked .
 - What else you got in there ? - Let 's see ....
 - Where does the Pope live ? - ln the woods .
 Wait , that 's the joke answer .
 Actually , it 's Vatican City .
 Now , what do you know about vulcanized rubber ?
 Spock 's birth control .
 You need these books .
 This used to be your room ?
 You must have been in really good shape as a kid .
 I 'm such an idiot !
 I can 't believe I thought she could change .
 Who cares what your mom thinks ?
 So you " pulled a Monica . "
 I 'm glad that 's catching on .
 Why does that have to be a bad thing ? Just change what it means .
 Prove your mother wrong .
 You finish the job , and we 'll call that " pulling a Monica . "
 What ?
 If a kid gets straight A 's , his parents say , " You pulled a Monica . "
 A fireman saves a baby , and they go , " He pulled a Monica . "
 Someone hits a homer , and they say , " That one 's out of here . "
 Because some things don 't change . All right .
 I 'll go down there .
 I won 't serve the lasagna . I 'll serve what I make .
 My breasts are really strong .
 I have to get you locked back up . I 'm so going to lose my job !
 She 's very private about her office !
 Now I know why !
 You 're in trouble either way .
 If she sees me locked to this ... ... she 'll know you were here .
 You might as well let me go .
 - I 'll clean your bathroom for a month . - Still won 't be clean .
 All I want is my freedom .
 - Foot rubs for a month ! - Freedom !
 - I 'll put all your photos into albums ! - I want my freedom !
 Why won 't you hear me ! Sophie , help me !

 Sophie , sit !

 Would you just calm down ? !
 I 'm going to say this for the last time .
 Would you please just
 There 's a lot I didn 't know about vomit .
 In a minute . So what do you say ?

 You get the whole set of encyclopedias for $1200 .
 That works out to just 50 bucks a book . $1200 ?

 You think I have $1200 ?
 I 'm home during the day ... ... and I got patio furniture in my living room .
 There 's a few things you don 't get from book learning .
 Well , what can you swing ?
 How about zero down and zero a month for a long , long time ?
 You don 't have anything ?
 You want to see what I got ?
 I got a baby Tootsie Roll ... ... a movie stub , keys , a Kleenex ... ... a rock ... ... and an army man .


 Okay , I get the picture . Thanks for your time .
 And a fifty .
 These must be Chandler 's pants .
 For $50 you can get one book .
 What will it be ? A ? B ?
 C ?
 I 'll stick with the V.
 I want to see how this bad boy turns out .
 I will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts !
 I 'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning !
 - With extra pulp ? - Yeah .
 I 've got it !
 You don 't have it .
 I have so got it !
 There will be rumors about this . No way to stop it .
 Sophie , Monica and Phoebe know .
 - How do they know ? - I called them .
 When they ask me what I saw ... ... I can be very generous ... ... or very stingy .
 Go on .
 I can make you a legend .
 I can make you this generation 's Milton Berle .
 - And Milton Berle has - Not compared to you .
 They 're not even touching the lasagna .
 They love your casserole !
 It 's hard to believe a while ago this was just ingredients .
 Everyone seems to like your dish .
 And you ?
 I thought it was ... ... quite tasty .
 So if everyone liked it , and you liked it ... ... that would make this a success .
 Which would make you ....
 A bitch ?
 I meant " wrong , " but we can use your word .
 Yes , well , I was wrong .
 And I have to say ... ... you really impressed me today .
 You might even say that she " pulled a Monica . "
 She doesn 't know we switched it .
 And the next time you cater for me ... ... there will be nothing but ice in the freezer .
 That really means a lot .
 Mom , don 't bite your nails !
 Hello , Chandler .

 I love you . What 's going on ?

 No , he doesn 't !
 Two hours , that lasted . So did you break up with Joanna ?

 I think so .
 It 's good you got out , before she blew up like Vesuvius .
 The volcano ?
 Speaking of volcanoes , man , are they a violent igneous rock formation ! What ?
 Lava spewing , hot ash .
 Of course , some are dormant .
 Why are you talking about volcanoes all of a sudden ?
 We don 't have to .
 What do you want to talk about ? Vivisection ?
 The vas deferens ?
 The Vietnam War ?
 Did anyone see that documentary on the Korean War ?
 Korea 's a beautiful country .
 With such a sad history .
 Could there be more Kims ?
 - Who 's out there ? - Me !
 Good morning !
 Could you come in here , please ?
 They didn 't have poppyseed bagels ... ... so I have sesame Oh , my word !
 Sure !
 I 've had a slight office mishap .
 Could you get the key for me ?
 - lf you could .
 - Oh , I 'm sorry !
 You can tell your friend Chandler we 're definitely broken up this time !
