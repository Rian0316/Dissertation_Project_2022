 Max , did you pick up the tip from table two ?
 No , but I 'm pretty sure I picked up a staph infection .
 So they literally gave me their two cents worth .
 This is so embarrassing , even Abe Lincoln won 't make eye contact .
 Girls , I need you to do something for me .
 You know the rule : nothing for you , on you , near you , or in us .
 I 'm going to restroom .
 Keep eye on the kitchen .
 I have a four- minute egg and a five- minute date with the
 Hey , do you see what I see ?
 A fire ?
 No , a way out of this job .
 Lord Jesus , there 's a fire .
 You two gonna do anything about that ?
 ' Cause I 'm not .
 I don 't mess with fire or Presbyterians .
 Fire , fire !
 I smell fire !
 Well , don 't just stand there .
 Do something !
 We are .
 S 'mores !
 You 'd think you want this place to burn to the ground .
 You 'd think that .
 Caroline , do something .
 I 'm on it .
 Chocolate ?
 ( Caroline ) Han , not too close .
 You know you can never get the smell of Korean barbecue out of your clothes .
 [ shouting ]
 [ shouts weakly ]
 Either he put the fire out , or that little robot just had an orgasm .

 Welcome to The High dessert bar .
 I 'm the hostess slash quasi- manager .
 First day in , got a huge promosh .
 I hate to brag , but the word " dazzling " was used .
 Yeah , by you .
 Little to no power has really gone to your head .
 It has .
 She 's like the Putin of pastry .
 But doesn 't it feel good to not just be working at the diner ?
 I haven 't slipped on one used baby diaper all day .
 Speaking of babies ,
 look , there 's Han .
 That 's , like , the third time
 I caught him spying on us .
 Why would he stalk two of his worst employees ?
 I know .
 It 's like when you don 't want to find Waldo .
 Not seeing a hostess up in here .
 She meant quasi- manager .
 If Marty Scorsese walks in here , do you want him to seat himself ?
 He 'll be lost .
 Lost .
 Sorry , Joe , I was just over there giving Max ...
 Honey , I 'll download an audiobook if I want to hear a story .
 I want you to meet someone .
 Me too , and I 'm sure I will when the time is right and I 'm open to it .
 Kind of focusing on me right now .
 Stop .
 Learn to read faces .
 I 'm not talking about you .
 I 'm talking about him .
 [ with Irish accent ] Hello , pleasure to meet you .
 I 'm Nashit .
 Nashit 's an Indian name , and isn 't that an Irish accent I detect ?
 Or have I just lost consciousness from how white your teeth are ?
 Yes , it is .
 My father 's Indian .
 My mother 's Irish .
 He 's Irish .
 He 's Indian .
 He 's East meets West .
 He 's everything in a hot Irish coffee , boy band package .
 I found him on the street next to a dirty chair .
 Hi , I 'm Caroline , the hostess slash quasi- manager at The High .
 Are you high ?
 ' Cause that was a lot of talking .
 Who is this , and where can I get one ?
 This is Nashit , our new waiter .
 Oh , it 's lovely to meet you .
 [ gasps ]
 Can you say " magically delicious " ?
 I really want Nashit to work out .
 I like it when good- looking people succeed .
 Well , I guess that 's good news for me .
 Is it ?
 Hi , honey .
 ( Joe ) Have you met the new waiter ?
 I love him .
 He 's my favorite .
 If I did men , he would 've been done by now .
 Hmm , so you think you 're pretty .
 Well , I do too .
 Okay , Nashit , pay attention .
 These are the tables .
 This is the dessert bar .
 And these are my boobs .
 Max , be professional .
 These are my boobs , sir .
 Please , I have to make him a waiter .
 Fine , you make him a waiter , and I 'll just make him later .
 Here you go .
 This isn 't yours , is it ?
 No , because they already have dessert .
 Damn it .
 You asked for water , like , an hour ago , didn 't you ?
 I 'm so sorry .
 Oh , don 't you worry those lips .
 And what 's an hour when we have our whole lives ahead of us ?
 Max , I don 't know what I 'm gonna do .
 I stink as a waiter .
 This is desperate .
 Well , desperate times call for us making out .
 Hey , I have a question for you .
 Your skin is so creamy and white .
 You must have a little Irish in you .
 I 've had a lot of little Irishes in me .
 That 's meant to be dirty , right ?
 Well , I just mean that I think you 're quite beautiful .
 Oh , well , then I just mean we 're doing it .
 I did not think there was somebody who had a prettier nose or was worse than me waiting tables , but here we are .
 Nashit , there 's not a fork in the mix out there .
 Now , get out there and fork those women .
 Take it easy on him .
 I don 't want him to be all forked out by the time he gets to me .
 I 'm gonna have so much sex on my bed with Nashit that I 'm gonna need a new sheet .
 Aren 't you too old for him ?
 Yeah , but that test said mentally I 'm 14 , so we can totally do it .
 Well , I 'm off to Chinatown to have someone put needles in me .
 Oh , my God .
 I love your coat .
 You look gorgeous .
 I mean , the way it flows .
 Okay , so I can see you 're a kiss- ass , so here 's the thing .
 As my quasi- manager , or whatever nonsense you 're telling people ,
 I need you to tell Max and Nashit to cool it .
 There are no hookups here at The High .
 Done , and we can stop staying " quas " if we 're both on board with the manager thing .
 We 're not .
 The High is about fine pastry , not someone 's sordid love life .
 And in an ironic twist , I need you to kick my girlfriend 's hot ass out of here if she comes in .
 Here 's $100 .
 That 's $100 .
 Consider her hot ass out the door .
 We 're in a fight .
 She got drunk , stole my Black Card , and bought 90 people soup at Barney Greengrass , and the soup isn 't even good there .
 Do not take this as a no , because I want the money , but why can 't you just tell her yourself ?
 I can 't tell her myself .
 She 's younger than me , and everyone knows the mommy thing just isn 't sexy .
 Make sure she eats something and gets home safe .
 Caroline , I have a question for you .
 What do I do with the notes the women give me ?
 You 've gotten notes ?
 Just a few .
 [ gasps ]
 How could women be this desperate ?
 Max , this one 's from you .
 They 're mostly all from me , except the business card .
 I don 't need no damn card to let him know I 'm all business .
 Max , Joe just told me there are no hookups at The High , and judging from this very detailed picture you drew , that 's exactly what you 're planning .
 Oh , I was planning more .
 I just ran out of paper .
 We can 't lose these jobs .
 I have two $100 bills , and I 'm this close to pulling the trigger on an Amazon Prime account .
 Amazon Prime ?
 You have been driven mad with power .
 Fresh , flakey pastry .
 And speaking of flakes , there 's Joe 's flakey girlfriend .
 Can someone help me get my chair off my coat ?
 How did she get in here ?
 Probably floated in on a cloud of Valium .
 It 's go time , as in she 's got to go .
 You have a better chance moving an actual train wreck , but good luck .
 - Allie , hi , you ... - Shh .
 [ whispering ] Allie , hi .
 - You need ... - Sorry .
 But I am hungover , and I have a headache .
 Could I get a latte with a side of weed ?
 No , because this isn 't Amsterdam or Bill Maher 's house .
 Now , you need to leave .
 You know Joe doesn 't want you in here .
 Well , I 'm not leaving .
 My legs won 't move because my muscle relaxers just kicked in .
 John , can you do me a favor ?
 Walk Allie outside , and by that , I mean pick her up and carry her outside .
 I went to pastry school .
 I 'm not Shrek .
 Of course not .
 You 're much more Fiona .
 Girl , that 's good .
 I was gonna say the donkey , ' cause I have a fine ass .
 ( Allie ) Okay , fine .
 Driver , two stops .
 Barney 's and Fro- Yo .
 ( Max ) Earl , we 're late again .
 Did you keep us alive ?
 Max , I can barely keep myself alive .
 This morning , I had to jump- start my heart by putting my finger in the socket
 style .
 Oh , hello .
 So what did you girls do today ?
 I haven 't seen you since right here last night .
 Oh , really , Han ?
 ' Cause I swear I saw you lurking around outside The High .
 It was either you , or Pikachu is visiting New York .
 That one barely grazed me , because I 'm Korean , and Pikachu is Japanese .
 You don 't know anything about Pokemon .
 Han , you may not be Japanese , but in the future , you 're definitely gonna be poked by a Mon .
 And it was you .
 No , it was not .
 - Yeah , it was .
 - Wasn 't .
 - Was .
 - Wasn 't .
 - Wasn 't .
 - Was ... wasn 't .
 English is my second language .
 Admit it , you 're jealous we 're spending time with another restaurant .
 I am not jealous .
 - Are so .
 - Am not .
 - Am not .
 - Are so ... not .
 Oh , my God !
 Caroline , what the hell are you doing ?
 I 'm smelling a $100 bill .
 It 's from my other restaurant .
 It buys me nice things .
 Jealous ?
 I took you in when you had no one .
 Hi , can you help me ?
 I 'm looking for Max .
 Why , hello .
 Is it too late to be gay ?
 Nashit ?
 Oh , my God , he even looks good here in morgue light .
 We are so doing it .
 Caroline , you left your phone on the table at the restaurant .
 I confess , I used it as an excuse to come and see Max .
 This isn 't mine .
 It 's Joe 's girlfriend 's .
 I don 't have an iPhone 6 .
 I have an iPhone sick .
 D- O- I- N- G it !
 Max , why is Nashit here ?
 Because God owes me .
 You can 't seriously be into him .
 He looks like someone in a boy band .
 Yeah , and he 's going one direction ...
 Down there .
 But if you sleep with him , then Nashit is gonna hit the fan .
 How do you know you even like him ?
 You know what I like ?
 That we 're doing it .
 Hey , everybody !
 I just got hit by a cab , and , boy , am I in the mood for crab legs .
 The thing about you , baby ... you bounce back from a good pounding every single night .

 Wait a minute .
 That 's my booth .
 Oh , it 's lovely to meet you .
 What ?
 What the hell kind of accent is that ?
 I 'm from Ireland .
 What ?
 Max , you are not doing it .
 - Are .
 - Not .
 - Are .
 - Not .
 - Not .
 - Please , I went to Wharton .
 Look , we should go to your place when we do it so that Caroline won 't be there while we 're doing it .
 Lovely , but I just came to America two days ago .
 I have no place to go .
 In fact , I 've been sleeping on that dirty chair
 Joe spoke of .
 What ?
 Is he singing ?
 Oh , my God .
 He 's gorgeous and homeless ?
 That 's your dream guy .
 We are so doing it !
 Ugh , this is impossible .
 I feel like I 'm putting an Oscar dress on Precious .
 I 'm making up the couch for Nashit .
 That is so nice of you .
 He 's gonna need a place to crash after we have sex .
 No , that 's off the table .
 I can 't believe you invited him to stay here .
 And I can 't believe you refused to sleep at Starbucks tonight to give us some privacy .
 I mean , you like Nora Jones .
 [ whistling ]
 Max likey .
 - Max , listen .
 - No , you listen .
 I can 't afford candy , so he has got to be it .
 Thanks for the shower .
 Oh , no , his muscles point to his penis .
 [ knock at door ]
 Max , stop with the banging .
 I 'm not letting you out while you 're still in heat .
 ( Max ) It 's not me .
 I 'm making a list of ways to kill you !
 I feel like I 'm being a bother , and I think I 'm sleeping on a bong .
 [ knock at door ]
 ( Joe ) Open up .
 I know what 's going on in there .
 ( Caroline ) Oh , my God .
 That 's Joe .
 She must 've found out about you and Max hooking up .
 ( Nashit ) Oh , no .
 Max , Joe is here .
 You need to do that thing you do to scare people out of the hallway .
 What do we think , guard dog or little old lady with poor eyesight and loaded gun ?
 [ Max imitating dog barking ]
 Fine , I 'm going .
 This is why I never leave Manhattan .
 Hey , you need to get in the girls ' apartment ?
 I have a key .
 Find it here in my big bag .
 I know it 's in here somewhere .
 Well , I got the lip balm .
 I got ...
 Oh , look , I got the Holy Bible .
 I got ...
 Oh , look .
 Oh , the DirecTV remote .
 Oh , my God , I 'm losing estrogen .
 Max , you and Nashit go hide in your room , but no sex .
 You heard her , no sex , so everything but , and I mean everything , and I mean but .
 Oh , here it is .
 It 's right ...
 It was right under the cold cuts the whole time .
 ( Joe ) Caroline .
 Hey .
 Hi , Joe .
 Oh !
 Yeah .
 Ha !
 Yeah , the shorter hair makes sense now .
 ( Sophie ) Yeah .
 Good for you , Caroline .
 I hope you like long , boring stories .
 Okay , where 's Allie ?
 I know she 's here .
 I put a spy app on her phone , and I 'm not proud of it , but I 'm a jealous woman .
 Oh , her phone .
 I have it .
 She left it at The High when I threw her ass out today per your instructions .
 I don 't know how I thought this thing was gonna work out to begin with .
 We met at Coachella .
 We were both on Molly , this intensely hot
 Filipino girl .
 - Shh , shh .
 - I 'm hearing sexual sounds .
 And hints of secret shame coming from the bedroom .
 - Allie is here .
 - No , no one 's here .
 That 's just our white noise machine .
 I 'm shocked .
 You 're not even her type .
 Your lips are like two flair- pen marks .
 [ Nashit laughs ]
 That 's hot .
 Please don 't fire Nashit !
 The Dr. Seuss hats were my idea .

 We were playing
 I was Pop .
 I didn 't even know there was a boy in there .
 I only saw you .
 Okay , since there are no hookups at The High , if you don 't stop sleeping with him immediately , my new manager ... [ clicks tongue ]
 Caroline here is gonna have to kick his beautiful butt to the curb .
 But I was mid- doing- it !
 Honey , there 's a real funky smell in here .
 I got to get out of here .
 PS , this is where you live ?
 Take another $100 .
 Earl , hi .
 What kind of mood is Max in ?
 Pretty good .
 On the Max scale , she 's below slightly drunk but above punching a customer out .
 Oh , good .
 I was worried she 'd be mad at me
 ' cause I had to get rid of her boy toy .
 Caroline , I 'd put my hearing aids back in if I wanted to hear a story .
 Guess what I have for you in my purse .
 The tampon I asked for last week ?
 No , and again , so sorry about that .
 Really dropped that ball .
 Gummy worms .
 Yes , I took away your man candy , but I got you these , the hot ones that you like from the good candy store with the sneeze guards .
 [ gasps ]
 Fancy .
 And don 't worry about Nashit .
 I got him another job .
 Hot worm !
 Clean glasses coming through .
 Nice rack .
 Now I know why guys like saying that to me .
 There he is !
 There 's the new employee .
 ( Caroline ) Han , I can 't believe you would hire someone just 'cause Max asked you to .
 This has nothing to do with Max or you .
 The boy here said something to me that you two couldn 't understand .
 What 's that , sir ?
 That I was a hard worker ?
 That 's it !
 Yes !
 Manna from heaven .
 I actually have an employee who works .
 Jealous ?
 Now , this job , I can do .
 You know , growing up , I had five brothers and sisters , and since I was the least attractive ,
 I had to clean all the dishes .
 Meet you in the dish room , Nashit .
 Max , what are you doing ?
 There may not be hookups at The High , but there are hookups here at our lowest low , and we are doing it .
 Caroline likey .
