 It 's payday ! And I 'm not talking about the delicious
 Little treat with nuts .
 Han , not cool to brag about yourself .
 Here , Max , maybe you can use the money to buy a new attitude .
 " New attitude " ?
 Isn 't that the name of the boy band you 're in ?
 And Oleg , you 'll notice I docked your pay
 ' cause you didn 't even come in yesterday .
 I told you , I was working from home .
 There you go , Earl . Don 't spend it all in one place .
 You think you pay me enough to spend it in two places ?
 Oh , my God , this is less than it cost me to get here today .
 And I walked .
 I know .
 That 's all I made ?
 What is this , " 12 Years A Waitress " ?
 With you it 's more like " 12 Beers A Shift " .
 So many words , so little everything else .

 Man : Whoa !
 [ Caroline gasps ] Not the face !
 Not my beautiful face !
 Whoa . Whoa . Whoa .
 I warn you , I was in the Nutcracker Suite .
 - What 's that mean ?
 - This !
 [ groans ]
 Don 't worry Max , I handled it .
 Yeah , I just handled it too . That 's my booty call .
 Are you telling me you know him ?
 No , I don 't know him .
 He just comes over for sex on Tuesday nights .
 Do you need help up ?
 Not yet , I 'm still crying a little .
 Okay , up you go .
 Walk it off .
 [ groans ] Yeah , I bet that hurts .
 Nice going Caroline . You ruined the best part .
 Hi , I 'm Caroline , the roommate and prima ballerina .
 Sorry about your sugar plums .
 Sebastian .
 Ba- Ba- Ba ! No names ! No names !
 Uh , Caroline , you want a soda ?
 We have soda ?
 No , we don 't have soda !
 Why are you asking him his name ?
 He doesn 't wanna know my name and I don 't wanna know his .
 Hey , mind if I use your bathroom ?
 I need to check on the boys .
 See if they 're girls .
 How do you not know the name of the guy you 're intimate with ?
 " Intimate " ?
 Max , there are certain things you have to know
 About the guy you 're engaging in sexual congress with .
 Only you can make sex boring .
 Well , not too bad .
 One 's okay and the other one left on crutches .
 Later .
 Sebastian , wait .
 This is Max Black .
 Max , this is Sebastian .
 Nice to meet you , Max .
 Yeah , nice to meet you too .
 And you can just call me what you usually do .
 " Oh , God . "
 Hey is that a new shirt , Earl ?
 Why , yes it is , Max . I just got it in 1987 .
 [ text message ding ] Oh , great ! Look at this text .
 It 's from the guy whose sperm count you lowered .
 His name is Sebastian .
 Oh , he 's inviting you to come see him DJ .
 Oh , damn it ! I told you I didn 't wanna know anything
 About him , and now I know he 's a DJ .
 Which means he 's unemployed , so points for that .
 So what are you gonna text him back ?
 Nothing !
 The only back- and- forth I want from this guy
 Is on his back and for the fourth time .
 The best sex is secret sex .
 Then maybe don 't talk about it while I 'm eating .
 Well , I have a sexy secret .
 A crush on a girl .
 Oleg , we all know it 's me .
 That sweat- pant salute never lies .
 Not you . Don 't kid yourself .
 You couldn 't handle this beast in the sheets .
 I could totally handle you in the sheets , Oleg .
 What are you fighting for , Caroline ?
 Hey , everybody !
 All right , weather report :
 I just came back from a date and it 's raining losers out there .
 There 's my sexy , sexy , secret crush .
 Who , Sophie ? Not so secret .
 You two have already done it in every public space in Brooklyn .
 Yeah , and your apartment , twice .
 What ? We didn 't even wake you !
 Sophie , baby ,
 I 've been looking for the perfect woman
 And it turns out , what I want is in my own back door .
 Backyard .
 I think you 're both right .
 I hear your truck pull up .
 But I 'm not sure I wanna sign for your package anymore .
 I knew you were going to say that .
 So as a reminder , I 've created a Sizzle Reel
 Of our best sex .
 So it 's an STDVD ?
 It 's the extended version .
 Uncut , as you know .
 That 's it , cancel my brownie !
 Sizzle Reel ?
 I 'll watch it tonight while I eat my fajitas .
 [ text message dings ] Max , you just got another text from Sebastian .
 Who ?
 Please , can we go to the club to see him DJ , Max ?
 I wanna dance .
 The last time I shook my booty
 Was when we ran out of toilet paper .
 Max , thank you so much for taking me dancing .
 Well , you signed that paper that said if I did ,
 You 'd do the side work for the next six months .
 Are you sure this is the address
 Of the club Sebastian gave you ?
 Who ?
 Sebastian !
 This can 't be the address . It 's a Whole Foods .
 I know what it is .
 I can smell the cage- free body odor .
 Let 's just go in , ask someone if they know where the club is ,
 And maybe rip a grape off a stem . I 'm starving .
 Whole Foods , wow .
 Reminds me of when I was a whole person .
 Max , we can start looking for the club .
 All right , all right .
 I 'm gonna lay down some beats while you check out our beets .
 Organic !
 See ?
 This is why I didn 't want to know anything !
 You ask a guy his name and you find out
 He 's DJ 'ing next to radishes .
 And what kind of loser comes here to dance ?
 Woot ! Woot !
 Holla !
 And I don 't mean the kosher bread !
 Oh , no . How did you find me here ?
 Whole Foods is my sexy secret .
 You know what 's not a secret ?
 The organic Preparation H in that basket .
 Whole Foods is where I come to get my groove on .
 Why ? Is Chuck E. Cheese closed ?
 As much as I 'd love to see what else you 're gonna buy
 To rub on your butt , we 're leaving
 Before that DJ sees me .
 You mean DJ Fresh- and- Local ?
 The music be bumpin ' and we buyin ' pumpkin !
 Let 's go . I can 't believe I wore these for this .
 Wake up .
 It 's Tuesday , and the DJ didn 't come .
 Maybe he just drank too much .
 No ! He didn 't show at all .
 There 's no DJ Fresh- and- Local in my ones and twos .
 Well , what did you expect ?
 You ran out of there without even saying " hi " .
 We should 've stayed at the club .
 Stop calling it a club !
 He DJs at a supermarket ,
 Which is the lamest thing I 've ever seen ,
 Not counting the time
 You tried to bring back the phrase
 " Oh , no , you didn 't . "
 I 'm surprised at you .
 What if I judged you for some of your jobs ?
 Uh , bar- back slash captain of a shrimp boat
 In the Gulf of Mexico isn 't the bomb ?
 What about when you worked at the Gap ?
 Who told you about the Gap ?
 You , that time you were drunk , folding a sweater ,
 And you tried to help me " spring into summer "
 With cargo shorts .
 Fine ! I fell into the Gap . I needed the money .
 Maybe sebastian needs the money , too .
 Who ?
 [ knock at door ] And if you ever tell anyone about the Gap ,
 You will have a gap between your neck
 And where your head used to be .
 " Oh , no you didn 't . "
 Hey , I wasn 't sure if it was too late to come by
 But the Ouija board said , " Go ahead , the girls are up ! "
 You use that ?
 The only spirit I listen to is Two- Buck Chuck ,
 And he mostly tells me to take my top off .
 Yeah , Ouija helps me make all my big decisions .
 Like coming to America , adopting a Chinese orphan ,
 And leaving a Chinese orphan at the fire station .
 Those boards are creepy .
 You never know what you 're inviting in .
 I mean , what if we open a Hellmouth ?
 Aw , come on , girls , look around .
 I mean , you already have .
 Okay , now shh . Okay ...
 Ouija , should I take Oleg back ?
 Yes ?
 Oh , now , see , that is creepy
 Because I was shoving it to " no " .
 Do you want to get back with him ?
 Well , I 'm torn .
 And also , I don 't know what to do .
 [ dance music plays ] Throw your hands in the air like you just don 't kale .
 Max , I 'm proud of you for overlooking his job
 And giving this guy a chance .
 He 's making a DJ face . I 'm out .
 Oh , my God , Dylan .
 No , we can 't leave now .
 I just saw this girl , and she is the last person
 I want to see .
 What is the problem ?
 It 's Hilary Waldare .
 We went to Wharton together .
 So competitive with me .
 Loved it when I lost all my money .
 She even threw a party to celebrate
 And then had the nerve to invite me .
 Worst party ever , by the way .
 Uh , worse than being at a dance club
 That has a price club ?
 Max Black in the house of grain .
 And now he saw me .
 Well , I 'm gonna go hide before she sees me .
 I 'll be in Tom 's Shoes . Nobody 's ever over there .
 I 'm bustin ' out some free range electronic dance music .
 That 's right !
 I 'm bringing it in my own bag .
 Uh , okay , we good ?
 See you next Tuesday .
 Come on , stay . What 's your hurry ?
 I can 't watch any more people dance- shop .
 Max , come on . Get in front of me .
 See what you can do .
 Oh , you 're behind me this time . That 's new .
 All right , everybody ,
 Frisee , 'cause we got a special guest DJ in the hizzay !
 Who 's so hot it 's radicchio .
 Go on .
 Bob , I 'd like to bid $1 . 00 . $1 . 00 , Bob , $1 . 00 .
 Have your pets spayed or neutered .
 Speaking of neutered pets , here comes Han .
 Still counts as a DJ shout- out .
 Hey , why wait till Tuesday ?
 Why don 't I take a break and we can go in the back .
 I just need to find someone to cover me .
 Someone bogarted all the nut butter .
 How about half of someone ?
 Can I help you , miss ?
 Max ?
 What are you doing ?
 I 'm thirsty , broke , and they cut me off at the free lemonade .
 What are you doing ?
 Well , two dudes were getting it on
 In the family restroom , so ...
 Where 's Sebastian ?
 Who ?
 Oh , milk . Bottom shelf .
 What 's up ?
 You 're not doing it in the dairy case !
 Uh , no I 'm not , ' cause you won 't go away .
 Do you have to ruin sex everywhere ?
 Well , Max , if I wasn 't lactose intolerant
 Before , I am now .
 Oh , my God , Caroline Channing !
 Hi ! It 's Hilary Waldare .
 - Oh , my God ! Hi ! - Hi !
 I haven 't seen you since your party .
 Someone said you left crying . How are you ?
 I 'm great ! I mean , I 'm shopping at Whole Foods ,
 Buying some organic fuel that I 'll probably take
 A couple sips of in spin class and then throw away , so ...
 Oh , good , 'cause I heard you were still poor
 And that you were working as a waitress .
 A waitress ?
 That is insane .
 That is so insane it should be in an ice tub in an asylum .
 I 'm so glad you 're great , because when I saw you
 In those three- year- old Louboutins , I got worried .
 Also , you have an orange juice mustache .
 Oh . Where 's Max ?
 Milk .
 - Max , listen ... - Busy !
 Hilary 's still here .
 And she called me a waitress . How dare her .
 She humiliated me , and I didn 't even get
 A party this time . I 'm going home .
 ( store manager ) Hilary Waldare , report to register three .
 Oh , my God ! Did he just say ... ( store manager ) Hilary Waldare .
 Register three .
 He did ! Oh , my God !
 Max !
 Busy !
 What ? Do you wanna just join us ?
 Hilary Waldare works here , as a cashier !
 So I win !
 Everyone knows on the job humiliation chain ,
 It goes :
 Prostitute , hostess , waitress , cashier , Princess Jasmine in the Disney Electric Light Parade .
 What happened to not looking down
 On other people with crappy jobs ?
 Oh , please , this is real .
 Now if you 'll excuse me , I have got $14
 Burning a second hole in my pocket ,
 And I 'm gonna spend it here at register three .
 [ Sebastian moans ]
 Whoo !
 What , you couldn 't wait for me ?
 This goes out to Kelly in prepared foods .
 The Kelly with the cystic acne , not the Kelly with the bald spot .
 Now , where my Adele- heads at ?
 I 'm glad you have no line , ' cause I have an exclusive
 Private yoga class to get to ...
 Oh , Hilary !
 Yes , Caroline .
 I am a cashier .
 I 'm sorry , a what ?
 I 'm a cashier .
 Yeah , turns out things aren 't great .
 My husband left me for my dad .
 And they didn 't even cut me in on the lifetime movie rights .
 It 's on in January . Father is the bride .
 Let me just weigh your salad .
 Well , I 'm sure you 'll pull yourself together like I did . ' cause I 'm kind of killing it , life- wise .
 That 'll be $28 .
 There 's only $14 here . $28 for a salad ?
 Well , that 's dinosaur kale .
 Oh ! Mistake .
 Didn 't want the Dinosaur kale .
 Never liked dinosaurs and really don 't like them in my kale .
 Dinosaur kale gone .
 You 're just putting it on the counter ?
 Oh , I don 't usually shop for myself .
 Is that not how it 's done ?
 Caroline , do you not have enough money ?
 No , Hilary , I have enough money .
 I just don 't know why I have so many eggs .
 Here . You 're holding up the line .
 You obviously don 't have enough money
 To pay for your salad .
 Sad .
 I don 't know what you 're implying .
 Oh ! Here is my very successful business partner .
 Sorry it took so long . I couldn 't find my pants .
 I don 't know how they made it all the way to the loading dock .
 Face it Caroline , you came here to humiliate me
 And you can 't even afford that egg .
 On your face .
 Miss , did you drop this $20 bill ?
 Yes ! Yes I did !
 I dropped some money , too .
 Don 't push it .
 Thank you , sir . This is very kind of you
 And I really appreciate it .
 Anything for my favorite waitress .
 [ gasps ]
 Oh , I knew you were a waitress .
 Your store sucks !
 I just had sex in your dairy department .
 Keep the change .
 And buy your dad- husband a wedding gift .
 Okay , one more time .
 Ouija , should I be with Oleg ?
 15 out of 15 yeses .
 That 's still unclear .
 Sophie , this is silly .
 You know you two wanna get back together .
 Caroline , we already have the Ouija board .
 We don 't need another thing around here that 's flat
 And wrong all the time .
 Fine . Sophie , if it 's not me , after all I 've offered you , go .
 Ask the spirits who the man you are supposed to be with is .
 Ouija , please spell out the name of the man
 That I 'm supposed to be with .
 Oh , look , it 's moving .
 " V " , " A " , " N " ,
 This is what the world was like before the internet .
 " K " , " O " .
 " Vanko " .
 Vanko ? Yeah , that sounds cute .
 Yeah , I like it ... I 'm sorry , Oleg .
 The spirits have spoken .
 I 'm supposed to be with someone named Vanko .
 And they know the best .
 So you 're supposed to be with someone named Vanko ?
 Mm- hmm .
 " Vanko Oleg Golishevsky " ?
 I go by my middle name ' cause there were seven other
 Vankos in my family .
 But I didn 't even know that .
 Yeah , that means the Ouija is ...
 Oh , uh ...
 Ohh ... Yeah ...
 Oh , no , no , Vanko . No !
 I ... No , I ...
 We can ... You and I can get back together , okay ?
 But I just can 't be here right now .
 No , I mean , this is just too damn spooky !
 [ shrieks ]
 I can 't wait to tell my brothers Vanko and Vanko about this .
 Uh , uh , uh .
 Word on the street is , you 've been talking some smack about cashiers .
