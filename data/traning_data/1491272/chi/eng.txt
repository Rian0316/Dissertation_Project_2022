 You understand , right ? Sure , of course .
 As long as you 're happy , I 'm happy .
 ( sobbing )
 We were gonna take cooking lessons together and we were gonna go on camping trips together and then we were gonna sit around telling funny stories about our cooking lessons and our camping trips .
 I know , I know . ( sobbing
 So , has the boat sailed onex tonight or ...

 Whoa , what 's this ?
 Oh , boy .
 It 's just a little something that we got for you that used to belong to my favorite professor of all time .
 A fedora .

 I 'm Indiana Jones !
 I 'm Indiana Jones !
 That , my friend , is the Dominator 8000 , the best bullwhip on the market , according to my whip guy .
 Yeah , I have a whip guy .
 You know what we should do ? We should ...
 Finish ourd rinks , go out in the alley , and whip stuff .
 God , you just get me .
 Okay , I should get going . I got a date .
 Oh , are you still seeing that guy ? Uh , even better , seeing him naked .
 What !
 Oh ! I should go , too .
 I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night , and I don 't know , it 's weird .
 I already feel like seconds .

 Okay , Ted , you got first whip ! All right .
 ( imitating Clint Eastwood ) Hey , dummy .
 What did tell you about smoking in here ? Make him whip the habit !
 I 'so excited about this whip !
 I got whip fever ! Just whip him , Ted !
 Don 't even aim ! Just whip him ! I am so sorry .
 No , it 's just the whip 's not a toy , Ted .
 There 's such a thing as common sense , you know .
 Hey , you can whip me if you want .
 I will , some other time .

 Whoo !
 So , how long has this been going on ?
 ( sighs ) All summer . I knew it !
 I knew it ! I knew it !

 Whoa , hey . Whoa . Wow , no .
 Whoa ...
 Whoa , whoa , whoaLily .
 Girlfriend ?
 Slow your roll there , Lilypad . Yeah , yeah . You 've been together all summer .
 I dot get it . Okay , it 's like this .
 After we kissed , we sat down to have the talk .
 We should figure out what this is . Yes , we should .
 Or . Or ...
 Yes , we do .
 Or . Or ...
 Whoa !
 We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk . Yeah , the talk sucks .
 You have to , like , talk . ( groans ) And be all , " I don 't know .
 " It 's not that I don 't like you . " It 'sust that I haven 't had a girlfriend
 " in a really ng time . I hope it doesn 't make you mad . " ( groans ) Who needs it ?
 You needs it .
 Guys , you can 't just keep hooking up and not at least try and fire out what you mean to each other . Yeah , we knew you would say that .
 That 's why we kept it a secret .
 We , that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on . No , no , no .
 No . You need tdefine the relationship .
 You ne to have the talk . Or . Or ..
 ( Robin and Barney moaning )
 I know what you 're all thinking . " Who 's this cool peer of mine up in front the class ? "
 Well , I know the board says
 " Professor Mosby , " but to you I 'm Ted , huh ?
 Question .
 Awesome . Hit it . Yeah , here 's my question .
 " Ted , " who the hell do you think you are ? Yeah , " Ted . "
 We 're supposed to learn from you ? You failed as an architect . Well ...
 And if you 're a professor , where 's your h and your whip ?
 They 're at home . I didn 't think I 'd need ...
 And where are your pants ?
 ( laughter )
 Oh !
 ( gasps
 Oh , God . Barney , it was awful . I was teaching ...
 Shh , Ted , now 's not a good time .
 Whe do you keep your condoms ?
 Okay , look , mistake # 1 was taking that girl 's question .
 You don 't take questions on the first day . It shows weakness . Mistake # 2 was you should 've hit that .
 Dude , your pants were already off , u had a classroom full of people to cheer you on , and you n 't knock her up ' cause it 's a dream .
 Class dismissed .
 Mistake # 3 : dude , where was the hat ?
 Because if y 're not going to wear it , I 'm taking it back .
 I think what Barney 's saying is that definitions are important .
 You 're their teacher , not their friend .
 Exactly .
 If people don 't know their place , nobody 's happy . Amen .
 You have to make things clear .
 Run tell dat . Define the relationship .
 Yes ! No ! Lily , private convo time .

 Lily , can 't you just let us be happy ? You 're not happy .
 You just think you 're happy because you feel happy .
 And that 's not happy ?
 Of course not . You and Robin need to have the talk .
 Why ? Give me one good reason .
 I 'll give you 20 ...
 Wow , you can 't even think of one .
 Headlights . Deer .
 Lily , for the last time , things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be .
 Oh , hey , look , Brad 's here .
 I 've got two tickets to the Rangers/ Canucksame tomorrow night .
 I know you 're a hockey fan , so I was tnking ... Uh , oh , um ...
 Uh ...
 What do I have to do ?
 Put a gun to your head ? Buy you a six pack ?
 Oh , come on , Brad , that 's ... Wow , there 's really six of them .
 Uh , t , uh , I can 't .
 Why not ? You have a boyfriend ? No .
 No , no boyfriend .
 Great ! It 's a date . Hey , Barn .
 Hey , Brad ...


 You 're probably wondering why I 've been quiet all night .
 Um ... Damn it , Hordichuk ! You miss another gimme like that ,
 I 'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up ur beerhole ! Come on !
 Not really . The truth is ,
 I- I feel kind of weird being out with you .
 Oh , man . Is this the talk ? What ?
 No , this is good . Let 's get it all out of the way .
 Robin , I 'm looking for something serious .
 No , Brad , no , it 's ...
 But before we go any further , you should know something about my stuff below the belt .
 I was born a little different . God , no , uh ,
 Brad , no , um ... This iabout me and Barney .
 You and Barn ... Oh , oh , so you , you guys are ...
 Well , we- we- we don 't know what we are . I mean , my heart says " leap into it . "
 My brain says " it 's a bad idea . "
 Sounds like you guys need to have the talk .
 We 're not gonna have the talk !
 Would you just have the talk , okay ?
 It 's a five- minute conversation , and then you get to have sex afterwards .
 It 's great !
 Back me up , Ted . I don 't think the talk is necessary . What ? !
 Thank you , Ted . Because Robin is already his girlfriend .
 What ? !
 MacLaren 's Bar , four years ago ...
 How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend
 Simple : the rules for girls are the same as the rulesfor gremlin
 " Gremlins " ?
 Gremlins . Rule # 1 : never get them wet .
 In other words , don 't let her take a shower at your place .
 # 2 : keep them away from sunlight --
 And rule # never feed them after midnight .
 Meaning she doesn 't sleep over
 What about brunch ? Is brunch cool ? No , Ted . unch is not cool .

 Ok , new topic . How do I pick a tie ?

 I 've done all three of those things with Robin .
 Is she my girlfriend ?
 Just once , I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night .
 ANNOUNCER ( over intercom ) :
 Ladies and gentlemen , time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam ! CROWD ( chanting ) : Kiss !

 Kiss ! Kiss ! Kiss !
 Kiss ! Kiss ! Kiss !

 Hey , Bd .
 Brad , we can 't fight like this all night !
 We both got some good shots in .
 Let 's call a truce ! It 's oy , dude .
 I shouldn 't go kissing some other guy 's girlfriend .
 ( laughing ) Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , girlfriend ?
 He come on . That 's putting it a bit strongly .
 A bit strongly . She 's no Okay , yeah . A gifriend 's a bit much , Brad , okay ?
 ( both laughing )
 Okay , seriously .
 We 're at the point of physical violence . Now , will you ease have the talk ?
 Come on . That 's thing .
 I 'm always punching guys . Mm- hmm . Girls -- I 'll punch a baby .
 I don 't care .









 Hey , sorry I went little too far last night .
 Oh , look , we 've been over this .
 Unless I say " flugelhorn , " you haven 't gone too far .
 No , meant punching Brad . Oh , right .
 Look , don 't even worry about it . It 's ... oh . God .
 The doorknob 's broken off . We 're locked in here .
 Did , did you do this ? No . Flugelhorn .
 Did you do this ? No .
 Ted ? Ted , are you out there ?
 Ted 's not here , Robin .
 Lily , let us out of here .
 I 'd be glad to . Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk .



 Lily !
 Come on .
 Let us out !
 No .
 Sit down , define the relationship , write down that definition on a piece of paper , slip it under the door , and if I like what I read , you can go .
 We are not having the talk !
 Then you 'll die in there . You 're gonna lock us in here ? Well , guess what ?
 Maybe we 'll spend the whole day having sex !
 Well , guess what ?
 I brought Marshall with me , so maybe we 'll do the same .
 Hey , guys .


 Good morning .
 And I did .
 About 20 times .
 ' Sup , dudes ?
 Silence !
 This is Architecture 101 . I am Professor Mosby .
 But you can call me Ted . Professor Mosby .
 T- Dawg . Do not call me T- Dawg .
 Ner take questions on the first day .
 It shows weakness .
 Also , don 't look right here . ( Barney chuckles ) Okay , good luck .
 Byesies .

 Please save all your qstions until the end of the lecture .
 ( in high- pitched voice ) : Thank you ! Now ...





 I 'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mo but this isn 't Architecture 101 .
 This is Economics 305 .
 You 're in the wrong classroom .

 Here 's your ink- about- it for the day .
 Every single person in this room is already an architect .
 Architect ?
 Hmm .
 Ooh . " We 're just hanging out . "
 Just hanging out ?
 Not good enough .
 Not good enough !
 Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about ?
 Economics ? ( laughter ) No .
 No , no .
 Don 't laugh .
 He 's not ...
 He 's not entirely wrong .
 An architect must be economical in his use of space , so , well done .
 towards an A , huh ?
 " We 're seeing where things are going . " ( laughs )
 out of that bedroom . Not good enough .
 Not good eugh ! You -- why do you want to be an architect ?
 I don 't want to be an architect .
 Yes .
 Yes , exactly . It- It 's not something
 You dot have a choice , right ?
 None of you has a choice
 No questions !
 " We 're Barnman and Robin . "
 ( laughs )
 Oh , come on , you got to admit , that 's kind of funny , Lily .
 Not good enough . ( shouting ) :
 Not good enough !
 So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect , you 're wasting my time and yours .
 There 's the door
 You can go .

 Whoa . Whoa .
 Whoa .
 Whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait , wait , wait . Don 't- Don 't all leave !
 Architecture 's fun !
 Look !
 I brought a hacky sack !
 MAN :
 Sorry , I 'm late , everyone . My name is Professor Calzonetti . This is Economics 305 .
 You may return to your seats .
 ( Ted laughs )
 Uh , sorry , sir .
 This is , uh , Architecture 101 .
 Who invited their dad , right ? CALZONETTl :
 Young man , for the last 28 years ,
 Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14 , room 7 .
 Uh , yeah .
 Buddy , I 'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong .
 T- Dawg , you 're in the wrong room , bro .
 ( laughter ) Sorry .
 Coming through .
 Excuse me . Whoa .
 20 minutes late on your first day ? That 's rough .
 MARSHALL :
 Mm .
 Yeah , but here 's the funny thing .


 And it was kind of great . That 's awesome , Ted . MARSHALL :
 Yeah . Congratulations , buddy . Thanks .
 ROBlN :
 Nice job , Ted .
 BAEY :
 Hey , Ted , door five ! ( thump )
 Were you there ? Yeah , I got you , buddy .
 They still haven 't had the talk , huh ?
 I think I know how to speed things up ( sighs ) ( sniffing )
 Oh , not cool !
 Pancakes , fresh bacon .
 It is so yummy .
 Uh , dude , I 'm starving . Let 's ... Let 's just have the stupid talk .
 Come on . Fine .
 But how do these this even work ? What do we say ?
 ( Lily clears throat loudly )
 Huh .
 Where do you see this relationship going ?
 Oh , my God , that sounds so cheesy .
 ( laughin I know , right ?
 Totally . But , um ,

 I don 't know .
 I mean , it 's not like I don 't like you .
 I just haven 't had a girlfriend for a long time . I hope that doesn 't make you mad .
 Mad ?
 I feel the same way . I suck at relationshs .
 I mean , except with Ted .
 Man , he really got it right .
 I know it 's a cliche but he really ruined me for other men .

 BARNEY : Hmm .
 Maybe we should go back to being jt friends .
 Maybe . But , um ,
 I don 't want to stop having sex . Oh , good .
 Me , neither .
 Yeah . Friends isn 't gonna work . Nope .
 Oh , we 're not good at being friends . We 're nogood at being in a relationship .
 Wh are we good at ?
 I know something we 're good at . I don 't know .
 If we 're gonna do it again , I 'm gonna need some Gatorade , or ... No !
 No , t that .
 ( quietly ) : Lying . Okay , think about it .
 We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends .
 Why not just keep lying ?


 Really ? ROBlN :
 Yeah .
 Really .
 We sat down .
 We had the talk .
 Barney 's my boyfriend now .
 And Robin 's my girlfriend .
 I know it sounds nuts , but it feels good to say .
 We 're both afraid of commitment , but , the fact is , we also can 't live without each other .
 And if the alternative is not being together , then it 's worth taking this risk 'cause ... ... she 's awesome .
 And he 's awesome . He looks nice in a suit .
 She can handle her Scotch . He 's my boyfriend .
 And she 's my girlfriend .


 Oh !
 ( shoutg ) :
 Good enough !
 ( both laughing )
 We are good .
 She bought it .
 Hook , line , and sinker . are good .
 Oh , totally .
 Mm .
 So , you want to get some breakfast ?
 You know , brunch actuall does sound kind of good .
 Hmm . Well , lead the way , sweetie pie .
 Wow !
 Flugelhorn . Yeah , that felt wrong . Mm .
 Mm .
 ( laughs )


 You do realize they were lying , right ?
 No , Ted .
 They don 't realize they weren 't lying .


 Oh , hello .
 Hello .
 Good evening .
 Hello .
 Don 't get up .
 Didn 't we meet on a yacht ?
 Hello .
 What ? Oh , no !
 Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night ?
 Doesn 't feel very good , does it ?
