 DOOR CHlMES

 This way , Mrs Brompton .
 Thank you .

 To what do we owe the pleasure ?

 Well , it 's that time of year .

 Oh , the Daffodil Ball , I 've been counting the days .

 And who 's the lucky lass tonight ?
 Who can say at this point , Mrs Brompton .

 Ah , Jim , Jim , perfect timing .

 Ah , wallet !

 I 'm sorry , what am I paying for now ?

 It 's the Daffodil Ball tonight .
 All proceeds go towards the restoration of the steeple .

 It 's the highlight of the social calendar .
 There 'll be music , dancing , the frisson of a warm spring evening .

 Mr Farnon not in ?
 He 's yet to grace us with his presence .
 How about it , Mrs Hall , a ticket for you ?
 Just four , please .
 Four ?

 Yeah , need one for my date for the evening .
 Your date ?

 The day is young .
 Come on , Jim , no girl likes a cheapskate .

 Who 's the extra one for ?
 Who do you think ?
 Time waits for no man , Jim lad , and neither will Helen .
 Morning , Mrs Brompton .
 Diana - please .

 How can we be of service ?

 Daffodil Ball .

 If you 're not too busy I wondered if we might lure you on to the dance floor .

 Well , that depends what you 're using as bait .

 SHE GlGGLES
 Stop it .
 It would be our pleasure to support the cause .
 Tristan , money ?
 Yeah .

 " Our pleasure " really ?
 And , uh , Mrs Hall , would you mind showing Diana out ?
 Show her out ?

 We 'll have to scrape her off him first .

 This way .
 Swap .
 Thank you . Thank you , bye- bye ...


 What ?
 What , is it ?

 I mean , if you can 't see , then there 's really no hope for you , brother .

 If that woman were any more forward , she 'd be here yesterday .

 Nonsense , Diana 's happily married .
 Isn 't she ?

 Not any longer .
 Not for a year now .

 Well , she was probably just being friendly .
 You know , I heard he ran off with the housekeeper .
 I heard the gardener .

 How did you get on with Merrick last night ?
 I thought you were going to tag that on to the end of your list .
 Oh , James , you really can 't allow yourself to be so forgetful .

 The memory is a muscle that must be exercised .

 I 'll get up there right away .
 No , no , you 've got a busy surgery today .

 Here .

 Organised as ever .
 Why doesn 't Tristan stay and help out ?
 With both examination rooms in operation , we 'd get through them a lot quicker .

 I 'd like to keep Tristan under my wing for a while .

 He 's still got a lot to learn .

 Go on , go and get ready .

 Mr Farnon - postcard from Dorothy .
 Who 's the old Siegfried ?
 And why does she hope he gets out from time to time ?
 Sorry , I thought it were for me .

 I didn 't realise until it were too late .

 I 'm sure .
 HORN BLARES

 All right , all right , I 'm coming .

 No Rover ?
 Not today , it 's leaking oil everywhere .
 Do your tie up , man , we must present our very best self to our clients .
 You know , you could do far worse than Diana Brompton .
 I see you got another postcard from Dorothy .

 How 's Malta ?

 Hot and rocky .

 She 's looking forward to becoming a grandmother .
 Shame , I got the impression you were rather fond of her .

 Oh , hang on , hang on , slow down , slow down .
 Stop .

 Morning , Helen .
 All right , Triss , Siegfried .

 What can I do for you ?
 Oh , it 's not me , actually .

 Um , I think James wanted to see you about something .
 He 's at the house if you wanted to pop in .

 Right .

 Thanks .
 Bye .
 BOTH : Bye .


 Helen .
 Hello .
 Please , come in , come in .
 Come on through .

 There we are .
 OK , then ... .. how can I help ?

 I thought you wanted to see me .

 You did ?
 I mean , I do . Why wouldn 't I ?


 Of course I 'd like to see you ...

 Right .
 Only , I 've got to get back and put our carrots in , so , shall we ?
 Sorry , shall we what ?
 The reason you wanted to see me .

 I 'm not sure I understand - you came here .
 Because Tristan asked me to .

 Ah .
 He said you wanted to speak to me about something .

 I 'm sure he did .

 Well ...
 Triss and I are going to the Daffodil Ball .

 And I couldn 't be happier for you .

 Oh , no , no , he 's not ...
 Not together .

 I mean , well , we are but not ...
 James , it 's fine ... .. you have my blessings .

 See , because of that ... .. now I 'm not inviting you .

 I had a spare ticket but I 'll just have to give it to someone else .
 Probably for the best .

 I haven 't really been out since ... .. well ...

 No- one will care .

 We 'll go as a group , you , me , Triss ... .. whoever he manages to drag along .

 I 'm a terrible dancer , so that amusement alone is a good enough reason to come .

 I don 't know .

 DOOR CHlMES
 It 's my dog .

 He disappeared yesterday evening on one of our walks .

 I found him when I went back out again this morning , he must 've been in this trap all night .

 Well , bring him through .

 James !

 DOG WHlNES

 I need you !

 Don 't worry , go .

 We need to get him something for the pain and sedated right away .

 What 's his name ?
 It 's Rock .

 Mrs Hall , pass the cotton wool , please .
 You 'll be able to save him , won 't you ?
 I can 't tell .
 I won 't be able to tell you until I 've explored the wound .
 Who would do such a thing ?

 It 's monstrous .

 Oh , it looks a mess .
 I won 't know until I 'm right inside how bad it is .

 What I 'd do for an X- ray machine now .
 Doesn 't seem natural , being able to see your insides on the outside like that .

 They 're an incredible diagnostic tool .

 All right , he 's asleep .

 I don 't think the leg 's broken .

 We better hope there 's still some circulation to the paw .
 And if there 's not ?

 I 'm afraid he 'll lose the foot .
 Colonel , good morning .

 Now , then , Farnon , what 's all this about ?

 We were expecting you last night .
 Yeah , I 'm afraid , there was something of an administrative balls up .

 My colleague missed you off his list .
 Oh , and there I was believing I was one of your most valued clients .

 Oh , I 'm almost hurt .
 Rest assured , you have my undivided attention now .
 Bag please , Tristan .

 Yes , err , unfortunately , I 've had to find another dance partner .

 Sorry to say , too little , too late , old chap .
 Still , there 's , there 's nothing like a bit of healthy competition to keep you on your toes , hey , Farnon ?

 Indeed .
 George , what a qualified pleasure it is to see you .

 HE LAUGHS
 Now , now , chaps , we mustn 't squabble .
 I 'd hate to be the bone between a pair of scrapping dogs .
 If you 're finding yourself unable to cope ,

 I could always take a few more clients off your hands .

 I 'm perfectly capa ...
 More than capable , thank you .
 Oh , there 's no shame in admitting you can 't keep up .

 The years are rolling on .

 Ha- ha , the coup de grace .
 Until next time , Hubert .
 Rolling on ?
 You 're rolling on .

 He 's older than I am .
 Still , since you 've come all this way , there 's no harm in you casting an expert eye over her .

 I imagine there wouldn 't be a charge - on account of all the bother .

 No , of course not , Hubert ... .. anything for our most valued customer .

 I 've asked this morning 's clients to come back this afternoon .

 I don 't understand why Siegfried doesn 't let Tristan run surgery .

 If there were two of us , we wouldn 't have to send anyone away .

 Mr Farnon has his ways ... .. maddening as they might be .

 It 's best to let sleeping dogs lie .
 Mm .
 I 'm not sure I 'd describe Siegfried as a sleeping dog .

 Thanks .

 How 's he getting on ?
 I 'd like to be able to give Mr Hammond some good news .
 I don 't think the bone is broken .

 We need to hope it 's not infected .
 Seems like a nice chap .

 He does .
 He is .
 I better get a brew on before he wears a hole in the floor .

 I 'll do the best I can .
 102 . 5 .

 Stethoscope .
 Thank you , Tristan .

 Pandhi said her insides are blocked up , gave her some linseed oil to grease the wheels .

 Really ?
 Well , that 's one way of doing it , I suppose .
 And that 's not the treatment you 'd prescribe ?

 Well , we all have our different approaches , Colonel .
 And different degrees of success that go with them .
 COW MOOS
 Yes , I thought so .
 You 're struggling , aren 't you , old girl ?
 Stomach powders .
 Coming right up .

 I 'm afraid there 's definitely a blockage .

 It could be she 's had too much roughage and that 's bunged her up or there could be a wire or something else caught up inside .

 Well , it sounds serious .
 More common than you 'd think .
 Did Pandhi not mention the possibility ?

 I told my stock man to wait for you , Farnon .

 Lesson learned .
 We 'll start off with the powders to help her work it through and if that doesn 't shift it , I 'm afraid we 'll have to come back and operate .

 COW MOOS
 Mr Hammond ?
 Oh , noticed the timing 's off .
 Well , I put it forward every morning .

 Well , I could fix it for you , if you like ?
 Oh , I 've got used to it now .

 Sometimes I put it forward more than I should to get them out the house sooner .

 Well ... .. there speaks a woman wise to the world .

 Wise to the lot I 've been lumbered with , certainly .
 Sorry , I 've never been good at waiting for news ,

 I have to keep myself busy .

 You and me both .
 Mr Herriot is a wonderful vet .

 If you want any more milk , you just let me know .

 I will .
 I 'm sorry , in the rush , I didn 't catch your name .
 It 's ... .. Audrey .

 Gerald .
 Sugar , I forgot the sugar .

 I 'll just , um .

 No , no , I can leave that .

 And I 'll come back with your , uh ...

 .. with the , um ...
 Sugar .

 That 's the chap .

 What 's this ?
 It 's the list .
 The list , man .
 Don 't look like that , tell me what 's next . Oh .


 Mr Dinsdale .
 Ah , yes , sow , aural haematoma .

 See ?
 All up here .

 Why would you have Merrick written twice ?

 Well , I wouldn 't .
 Unless this was left in your pocket from last night .
 Which would suggest you were supposed to go to Merrick 's and not James ?

 What 're you doing ?

 We must present our best self for the clients , Siegfried .

 Morning .

 Oh , we thought it 'd be a grand adventure ... .. too young to know any better .

 You were in good company .
 I should never have been there in the first place ,
 I lied to the recruiting officer about my age .
 Oh , God , you were one of those ... .. king , country .

 The usual nonsense .

 You know , funny thing is ... .. I wouldn 't change it for the world .

 Even though it left me hobbling about .

 The struggle makes everything all the more worth it .
 I 'll keep telling myself that .
 Mr Hammond , you can come through .

 Thank you for the tea .
 We 've patched him up .

 I 'm worried there could be an infection , the wound must 've been open for some time .

 If it spreads , it could poison the blood stream .
 And then what ?

 There 's still a chance he could lose the leg .

 Hm , better that than his life .
 Leave him with us for a few days .

 Hey , you 'll be all right , Rock , lad .
 This nice gentleman and kind lady are going to take care of you .

 And Jess will keep him company .

 Will we be seeing you at the dance then ?
 God willing .

 So long as you fulfil your professional obligations first .
 And , by God , I naturally mean my brother .

 Them eggs will not collect themselves , you know .

 Should have kept her locked in the coal shed .
 Our little Buttercup 's in here .

 Now , that boil on her noggin 's even bigger than last time you were up .

 I didn 't have the correct instrument to complete the procedure .
 Here 's our little lass now .

 Holy Mary , Mother of God .
 Oh , yes , I can see from here the haematoma 's even more engorged .
 Ah , looks fit to burst .

 I thought about going in and having a go myself , like ... .. not for very long , mind .

 Yes , well , it 's becoming apparent to me now why you might have left your scalpel at home last time .

 Thankfully , I believe we have it here today .
 Mm .

 I don 't know why you 're handing that to me , we learn by doing , little brother .

 I imagine she 's called Buttercup because uh ... .. well , despite appearances , she 's a tender and sweet soul at heart ?

 Not as it goes .

 Nearly took me finger off once .

 If she gets hold of you , my advice is to play dead .

 Unless you think she might actually kill you , in which case , don 't ... .. play dead , I mean .



 Right .
 Siegfried ?
 Come now , Tristan .
 It 's alright to be frightened , for without fear , there cannot be courage .

 Ha , without courage , there can 't be pain .
 # I 'm called Little Buttercup
 # Dear Little Buttercup . #

 Try not to startle it !

 Forget the pig , you startled me !

 Good Buttercup .
 Good pig .

 BUTTERCUP GRUNTS
 Oh , God !

 BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

 Oh , ah .
 Mr Dinsdale , I fear we may have to return with anaesthetic to tame the beast before we operate .

 Oh , aye , when would that be then ?
 Oh , not until this evening .
 What ?

 No , Siegfried , we can 't come back .
 Look , we 're here now , I 'll do it now .

 He 's either very brave or very stupid .
 I believe it 's a heady mixture of both .

 No courage without fear .

 BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

 Good God !
 I admire your persistence but sometimes discretion is the better part of valour .

 He 's done it .

 I 'll be damned .
 I did ?
 I mean , yes , I did .

 Yes , well , you made a bit of meal of it but you got there in the end .

 Maybe I 'll , uh , see you later .
 Tristan , it 's this way .
 Frowning at it won 't change it .

 It 's from a friend of my mum 's .

 He owns a vet 's practice in Glasgow .
 Hm .

 They 've offered me a job .

 Well , I 'm not surprised .
 Who wouldn 't want you working for them ?

 Mum seems to have accepted it for me .
 Oh , dear .

 The practice is run by a man called Bill Weipers .

 He 's on the board at Glasgow Veterinary College .

 He employs modern methods and equipment .
 He has an immaculate practice , sterile examination rooms , nurses ,

 X- ray machine .
 And you got lumbered with us lot . well , it 's just a different ... .. very different way of working .



 If you ever have any ideas about how you might improve this place ,

 I 'm sure Mr Farnon would hear you out .

 If you catch him on a good day , perhaps .

 It 's more complicated than that , Dad 's struggling to get work .
 They 're really struggling to make ends meet .
 Well , they 'd want you to be happy .

 As a parent , that 's all you want for your children .

 It feels so selfish .
 They spent their life savings putting me through college , I owe it to them .

 How long have you got to decide ?

 I 've got a few months to work out if there 's something here worth staying for .

 Or someone ?
 Helen took the other one .
 How many cases have we got to get through this afternoon ?

 16 .

 We 'll use both examination rooms .

 While I 'm treating an animal in one ...

 I 'll settle the next one into the other room .

 Once I 've finished treatment , you show them out , settle up the bill .

 I 'll go straight through to deal with the next .
 Righto .

 Hello , there .
 Hello .
 Good afternoon .
 Mr Herriot .

 Afternoon .
 Hello .
 Right , Mrs Kirkby , with a rabbit .

 That 's me .

 Lovely .

 Miss Fearnly ?
 Yes , lovely .
 Would you like to come through ?
 Thank you , Mrs Jackson .

 Keep George warm by the fire , that 'll help speed up the waking process .

 Thank you , love .
 It 's Anne with Susie .
 I 'll be with you in a second .
 And don 't you look happy about it .

 Sorry , I 've been rushed off my feet .
 Hello , Susie .

 How 're you getting on with those pups of yours ?

 They 're all grand .

 First one you got out 's biggest of the lot .

 We named him James .

 I 'll have to come up and visit him .

 Don 't worry , Susie .
 Hey , we just need to check how you 're getting on .
 BELL RlNGS

 Excuse me .
 Come on through .
 Hi , Helen .
 Hi .
 You look ...

 It 's good to see you .

 Shall I come in ?
 Yes , of course .

 I 'm just finishing up , I won 't be long , I swear .
 She won 't mind waiting .

 Oh , hello .

 Tea ?
 I think so .
 Oh , you 've certainly put the weight back on .

 Sorry , Susie .

 That 's very rude of me , isn 't it ?
 You know , if ever you 're to get beyond smiling at the girl ... .. you might eventually have to do something about it .

 What happened to the other one ?
 What ?
 I thought we could chat .

 Um .. .. yeah , great , OK .

 The other one , the barmaid , Margaret ?
 Maggie ?
 I suppose she got sick of you .
 Yeah , the thing about Maggie and me is we 're like ships in the night .
 Travelling our own separate courses ... .. occasionally we ... .. crash into one another during stormy weather .



 Meanwhile , you happily flit ... .. courting one girl and then the next .

 First of all - no- one courts .
 Then what are they doing ?
 They date .

 We 're not Americans .

 The world 's changing .

 Not every evening spent in the company of a woman necessarily has to end in something particularly meaningful .

 In fact , most often it necessarily doesn 't .
 Then what 's the point of it all ?

 Fun .

 I understand that 's a very alien concept to you .

 I am fun , I 'm perfectly bloody fun .
 You certainly used to be .
 Now I don 't know what 's happened .
 What 's that supposed to mean ?
 You didn 't used to be like this .
 Like what ?

 Allowing Merrick to get a free ride ... .. letting Pandhi rattle you and ... .. don 't even get me started on the women .



 Well , I imagine the problem 's getting you to stop .

 There 's no spirit , the fight 's gone .
 I assure you , it has not .
 Really ?

 Cos in the not too distant past , you would 've tackled that sow without a moment 's hesitation , just to show people that you could .



 I 'm not saying you 're past it but ...
 You just did !
 Stuck in a rut maybe , one that I thought Dorothy had got you out of it but ...

 I 'm not in a rut , there is no bloody rut !
 Oh , I 'll get that for you .

 Bye .
 Bye .
 Good evening , good evening , Mrs Hall , Helen , a delight as ever .
 What happened to you ?

 Fight with a pig .

 Is it hard to believe I actually won ?
 Bring your muddy things down , don 't leave them festering on the floor .

 It 's been a long day .
 You must barely recognise me .
 Oh , I don 't know Siegfried ,
 I think you 've weathered rather well .
 You 're very kind .

 How 've you been ?

 You know , one foot in front of the other .
 Glad to hear it .

 There you are , James .
 About bloody time , poor Helen 's being bored silly waiting .

 I 'm fine , Mrs Hall 's been looking after me .
 I had an emergency case ,

 I 've been playing catch up all day .
 You should really learn to deal with these cases .

 No wonder we 're struggling to turn a profit .
 I would say , Siegfried , if Tristan were here today , there would 've been no need to send anyone away .

 I want him with me until he 's served some time under my supervision .

 He 's more than capable .

 Oh , see how they shower me with praise ?
 Perhaps this could wait for another time ?
 No , if James has got something he wants to get off his chest , I 'd like to hear it .

 If Tristan were able to practise on his own , we could take on more work .

 With the extra money , maybe we could change a few things around here .

 Change ?
 Why on earth would we want to change ?
 We could be working much more efficiently , half of our equipment is from the last century .

 So am I !
 Should we just toss me out as well ?
 I don 't think James means that .

 Of course I don 't .
 Siegfried , I learned more from you in a year than I did in all the time I spent at college .

 You flatter to deceive .

 It 's true ... .. he told me as much before .

 I just want to be able to offer the best care possible to our patients .
 Of course , as do I.
 You know I 'm always open to new ideas .
 HE CHUCKLES

 What ?

 I am .
 Did you know we were the first practice in whole of Yorkshire to have our own centrifuge for TB testing ?

 And I always put us forward for the trial of new medications .
 We are a forward looking practice .
 And I am one who always looks ahead , rather than behind - always .

 Semper progrediens !
 Always progressing .
 I know .

 Good .
 Well , that all seems settled then .

 Now , shouldn 't you be going before something or other turns into a pumpkin ?

 Semper progrediens !

 I believe he 's fighting the inevitable march of time .
 Oh , Lord help us .

 Go on , get on with you , I 've my book to read .
 James ... .. good luck .

 You sure you won 't come ?

 Oh , it 's not for me .

 Listen to that , Jess .
 Isn 't that wonderful ?
 You 'll be fine .
 Dorothy happen to mention when she 'll be returning ?
 She has no plans at the moment .

 Oh , and how do you feel about that ?
 How do I feel ?

 When you care about someone very much , you ...

 People have these things , feelings , emotions .
 Dorothy 's a good friend - nothing more .
 Understood .

 Well , then ...

 .. without fear ...

 There can be no courage .
 Once more unto the breach .

 Diana .

 Good evening .
 Good evening to you .

 You 're looking stunning .
 Thank you .
 How many do you think he 'll dance with tonight ?

 I 've a feeling that once she gets a hold of him ... .. she won 't be letting go .

 My mum used to make me go to tea dances with her .
 It used to be me and a room full of old ladies .
 Mum used to make me stand up in front of all of them and request songs from the singer .

 She didn 't ?
 I had to dance with her ... .. and all her friends .

 That 's why I find it the most embarrassing thing in the world to do .

 It 's probably why I 'm terrible at it .

 Oh , James , stop it .
 You 're just saying it to make me feel better .

 So , I apologise in advance for the absolute shambles this 'll inevitably be but would you like to dance ?



 I promise once people see me out there , no- one is going to be talking about your wedding with Hugh .

 You 'd really do that ?

 You 'd make a complete fool out of yourself for me ?
 Every single day .
 No Maggie tonight , then ?
 No , no , boyfriend .
 Her , not me .

 That were very clever of you , tricking that pig in to bursting its own bubble .

 There 'd be some who 'd mistake it for you running away .

 Yes , well , it often takes brains as well as brawn to solve these problems .

 Hm , I 'd settle for a pretty face .

 How about it , then ?
 Oh , sadly , Anabel , I 'm just not one of life 's dancers .
 Oh , that 's handy ... .. because I 'm not one for dancing either .

 Outstanding .
 I 've no idea what I 'm doing .
 Don 't worry , you 're doing fine .
 Ooh .
 Sorry .

 It 's alright , I 've got another one .

 Look , try and loosen up , let yourself go with it .
 That 's it , that 's better .

 Ooh !

 That 's a little too much .
 I was sorry to hear about you and your husband .

 Which was it , the housekeeper or the gardener ?
 Oh , I don 't hold for such tittle- tattle .
 Both , actually .
 I wouldn 't blame him if it was the gardener - he was quite the dish .
 There 's even one going round where I 've got old Len buried in the basement .

 That 's why no- one 's seen him for so long .

 I don 't mind that one so much , it keeps everybody on their toes .

 Farnon , we 've got ourselves a bit of a problem .
 Yes , Colonel , I believe we have .
 I was in the middle of a charming conversation with this young lady and I 've been rudely interrupted .

 I beg your pardon ?

 You can beg all you like , you 're not having it .

 Now , if you 'll excuse me .
 You see , Colonel , what did I tell you ?

 He 's lost it .

 I do apologise , Diana .

 Oh , no need .
 I love a bit of drama .

 Now hear this , Farnon , that cow is still unwell .

 You told me it needed an operation .

 If you 're not willing to come up and sort her ... .. well , I can always take my custom elsewhere .

 Custom suggests a transfer of money for services rendered .
 I put a lot of work your way .
 Because we 're the finest in the district .

 We 've three qualified vets and enough work to necessitate the expansion of our practice .

 We don 't have to fight like jackals over scraps left by others .

 If you really want the best possible care for your animals , you can call during our normal business hours .

 Otherwise , go with the reserve team .

 Good evening .

 Good evening ?
 I 'll give you good evening !
 That was very impressive .
 Thank you .

 Where are we going ?

 No idea , I always like to sweep out at the end of an argument .
 But since we 're on the move , might I suggest somewhere more salubrious ?
 The Renniston , perhaps ?
 Why not ?

 Sorry again about your toes .
 Oh , it was great .
 You were great .

 It 's been so long since ...
 I really needed that .
 I 'm glad .
 I 'll , er , I 'll fetch our drinks .
 Don 't forget to come up for air .
 Goodnight , Tristan .
 Helen , been awhile .
 How 've you been ?
 Yeah , not bad .
 You ?
 Oh , same as always ...
 What do you say then , lass , Fancy a turn around the floor ?

 Oh , Fernley , this is ...
 Hello .
 I 'm James Herriot .

 Right , nice .

 I 'm sorry .

 I didn 't mean to ...
 If you two are together , then .

 Us ?
 Oh , no , we 're not .
 Are we ?
 No , not at all .
 Only , we were known to have the odd dance in the past .

 We even won a show together .

 Go on , at least he won 't stand on your toes .

 Right .
 Really , no trouble .
 Enjoy yourself .
 Thanks , James .
 Idiot .
 Tea , Siegfried ?
 If you wouldn 't mind , Tristan , thank you , very kind .

 When .
 Bless you .
 Good evening ?
 Oh , very much so .
 How long 's this going to go on for ?
 What ?
 The inane expressions ... .. the smug sense of satisfaction .

 Mrs Hall , I would 've thought you 'd be glad to hear we enjoyed ourselves last night .

 Oh , it 's enough to put me off my breakfast .

 What about James ?

 Did he enjoy himself ?
 PHONE RlNGS

 Darrowby , two , two , nine , seven .

 One moment .
 Mr Farnon .
 Colonel Merrick .
 Yes , what , is it ?
 Oh , you do ?

 Yes , well , I 'll have to consult our appointment diary first .

 Three o 'clock ?

 Breakfast 's on the table .

 I 'll be there in a minute .

 SlEGFRlED :
 See you then .

 How 'd it go ?

 He 's doing all right , temperature 's down .
 The infection is starting to clear up .
 You can call Mr Hammond and tell him to pick him up later .

 That 's not what I meant .

 Oh , love .

 It 's alright .
 There are a lot of people Helen needs to catch up with .
 SlEGFRlED :
 Herriot !
 Tristan !

 I 'm literally three feet away from you .
 I don 't understand why you have to bellow .
 Don 't be such a sensitive Sidney .
 Here .

 I 've been keeping these back , one each .

 And what are these for ?
 You said you wanted us to modernise , James ?

 We 're about to give the good Colonel a show he 'll never forget .
 Morning , Colonel .
 No Pandhi today ?

 You 're our vet , Farnon , for now , at any rate .

 Well , I 'm glad we managed to squeeze you in .

 Yes , prepare the patient for the operation .

 COW MOOS
 Thank you .

 Right .
 This is where we go in .

 I hope you aren 't squeamish , it 's not for the faint hearted .

 I 've seen blood before , you needn 't worry , I shan 't faint .

 Now , you see the rumen exposed , the cow 's first stomach , you know they have four ?

 Hang on Farnon , that doesn 't look too clever .

 Um , yes , it 's probably just a bit of ruminal gas .
 Wouldn 't you say ?
 Aye , probably .
 James , could I borrow you for a second ?
 Farnon , what was it you said , the finest vet in the district ?

 You 're putting on a right show , now .
 Siegfried , do you not think the good Colonel could benefit from seeing some of your handiwork up close ?

 You know , you really are full of good ideas at the moment , James .
 Yes , Colonel , come in .

 Come in , that 's it .
 That 's it , a little closer .

 Scalpel , please .

 There we are .
 Thank you .
 Ready , Colonel ?
 Oh , get on with it , Farnon .

 Oh , oh .
 COLONEL MERRlCK :
 Absolutely ...
 That 's what the problem was .
 What do you make of that ?

 Farnon , what the ...
 It 's Mr Farnon ... .. and my bill will be in the post .

 Well , I thought that went rather well .
 Mm .
 Absolutely .
 Quite the show . Text book .


 COLONEL MERRlCK :
 God , absolutely covered in the stuff .
 You 'll have to keep him inside for a few days to keep the wound clean .

 But I 'm pleased with how the infection is clearing up .
 Well , we can 't thank you enough , Mr Herriot .
 No trouble at all .

 Mrs Hall will show you out .
 Come on , then , Rock , here we go .
 It looks like these two have become firm friends .
 Oh , we 'll be sorry to see him go .
 Won 't we , Jess ?
 I 'm sure they could see each other again .

 We could take them for a walk together .
 One of the men usually take Jess out .
 Ah , well , never mind .

 Maybe we 'll see you out and about , hey , Jess .

 When you grow tired of moving your clock forward ,
 let me know and I 'll come fix it .
 Lost time is never found again .

 Come on , Rock , let 's go .

 Oh , hold on .
 Oh , Helen , love , good to see you .
 Is James about ?

 In there .

 Come in .

 I 'm just clearing up , won 't be a second .
 Sorry we lost each other last night .
 Oh , it 's fine , don 't worry .
 It 's been so long since I caught up with everyone .
 I 've known most of them since we were kids .

 Oh , it 's all right , I understand .

 It was the same for me when I went home , seeing everyone again .
 It feels strange hearing you call somewhere else home .
 You belong here .

 This is your home .

 I looked for you last night , couldn 't find you ?

 I got dragged into a conversation outside with Gene Gilbert and Mr Summers .

 Once they get their teeth in , they 're hard to shake off .
 I would 've liked to have danced with you again .

 If your toes could take it .
 Last night were the first time in a long time that I 've felt like myself again ... .. and I was only there because of you .



 Everything all right with Miss Alderson ?
 Aye , grand .

 Everything 's grand .
