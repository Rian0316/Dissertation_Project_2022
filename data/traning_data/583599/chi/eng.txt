 Previously on privileged ...
 - hello , Mrs. Limoges .
 - Call me laurel .
 My daughter left me 2 grandchildren , rose and sage .
 Their grades are lousy . You want me to be their tutor ?
 How 's megan ? She settlin ' in , makin ' friends ?
 No , she already told me that she wasn 't ready to date .
 What does it matter ? You 're already dating her sister Lily .
 That girl totally just hit on you .
 What if I was your girlfriend ? Uh , well , you 're not .
 - You 're out with sage ? - No big deal . It is a big deal , Lily .
 She 's 16 years old .
 She 's not even allowed in a bar .
 I thought you were calling to be nice to me . I was !
 Www . 1000fr . com presents capture : frm @ sync : frs@ jordanmicle
 Persp√©phone , Faraway , Ellie , Ladybird . all right .
 Traduction :
 Close your eyes .
 Imagine you and me ... massaged on adjoining tables , scented oils burning as our stress melts away .
 What kind of scented oils ?
 Jasmine or sweet almond ?
 Whatever you like .
 Now , back to those adjoining tables .
 Well , I 'd vote sweet almond , ' cause jasmine makes me phlegmy . OK . Mood is officially killed .
 Sorry .
 Allergies .
 No , it 's OK .
 I just , you know , I was a little out of my comfort zone , getting all sexy , sexy on the phone , and then , all of a sudden , phlegm , and ... well , anyway ... can we go to the spa now ?
 I don 't think I can wait to this weekend .
 Neither can I , but we must have patience , grasshopper .
 Patience , schmatience .
 I have got a knot so deep in my neck , it 's almost a bone .
 I 've named it sage .
 I take it your job 's not getting any easier on you .
 Uh , let me put it to you this way .
 This is my first weekend off in almost 3 months .
 Ohh .
 Other line .
 Hold , please .
 Hey .
 Charlie , can I call you back ?
 I 'm on the other line with jacob .
 I just need 2 seconds .
 Uh , OK . Hold on .
 Hey . So that 's Charlie , and he needs to talk to me for a second . Well , I gotta get back to work anyway .
 But don 't forget to pack your bathing suit , unless you 're a skinny- dipper , which by the way , I 'm completely fine with .
 Glad to hear it . Not gonna happen , but ... I 'll call you later .
 Hey . Charlie . What 's up ?
 You never called me back about the white stripes tickets , and scotty needs to know if we still want them .
 Oh , crap , I totally forgot . What 's the date ? The 23rd .
 It 's my sister .
 Hold on . Hey , Lily . What 's up ?
 Finally .
 Have you not been getting any of my messages lately ? Yeah , I have .
 I 've just been really busy . - I 'm actually on the other line , so ...
 - I just wanted to apologize about what happened the other night with sage . I had no idea she was so young .
 - Uh- huh . - I mean , she did have an I. D. , but whatever .
 I 'm sorry , OK ?
 Yeah .
 Fine . Doesn 't sound fine . What do you want from me ?
 I hate to say it , but " I 'm sorry " means nothing coming from you . What ?
 I mean , you say , " I 'm sorry " , but then you do the same crap over and over again , so what 's the point ?
 The point is I 'm trying to be nice . Iook , I can 't talk right now . I gotta go .
 Hey . Rose , um ... sorry .
 Sister on the phone .
 Do you need anything ? No . I just left my books in here .
 Well , we could go over that last chapter together if you want . You know what ?
 Just come get me whenever . Yeah . OK .
 Bye . Megan , a word , please .
 I 'll see you in my office .
 - Hello .
 - You gonna leave me on hold forever ? Oh , Charlie , I 'm so sorry .
 I forgot all about you . - Yeah , I know . - You know what ?
 I 'm sorry .
 I can 't talk right now .
 Can I call you later ?
 Megan ...
 I 'm sorry , laurel .
 You wanted to talk to me ?
 As you know , I 've been called to a board meeting in St. Barts this upcoming weekend , very last minute .
 - Yeah .
 It sounds exciting . - Not exactly .
 A few business dinners , a lot of ego stroking . St. Barts may as well be St. Iouis . Oh .
 OK .
 In any case , my granddaughters are taking advantage of my absence by throwing a little pool party .
 They think I don 't know about it .
 But then I 'm sure you 're already aware of their plans . Uh , actually , I ...
 I wasn 't .
 That 's very disappointing , megan .
 First rule in business ... always be more prepared than your superiors .
 Excellent rule , and normally I would be all over it , but since I 'm also leaving this weekend , maybe the girls slipped it by me .
 First time off in 3 months .
 We discussed it last week . Yes , well , we also discussed how the job requires flexibility .
 It would be extremely helpful to me if you could stay and chaperone the *** .

 Of course . Um ...
 I 'll just make some calls .
 Wonderful .
 Just keep things under control .
 And , uh ... hopefully you can take next weekend off .


 OK , we 're up to 65 " hell , yeah" s , 12 " bummer , I 'm on my deathbed" s , and 2 " have not replied" s .
 Let me guess .
 Breckyn and jordanna .
 They seriously need to get over themselves .
 I don 't know .
 I feel kind of bad .
 This was an emergency situation , rose .
 We had no idea laurel was going out of town this weekend , and we definitely didn 't know everyone was gonna ditch their party for ours .
 OK , that , we knew . But whatevs . Work it out with your therapist , people .
 What 's going on ? Nothing .
 Just school stuff . School stuff or pool party stuff that I 'm not supposed to know about ?
 Marco told you . He is so fired . Stop firing people .
 Marco didn 't tell me .
 You girls are underestimating me .
 OK , this is an impenetrable force .
 I am all- knowing , all- seeing .
 Laurel found out . Yeah .
 The woman 's good . But come on . I mean , did you really think that you would get away with it ?
 She would find out eventually .
 Yeah , but by then , we would have already had the party , so who cares ?
 She 's not gonna make us cancel , is she ? No , but she is making me chaperone .
 Forget that . I 'd rather cancel . Please .
 I happen to be an excellent chaperone .
 In fact , I was a quasi- chaperone for a few of my own high school dances .
 I worked the punch bowl . It was a very popular station .

 Oh ... my God . I have to go have an aneurism right now .
 Don 't worry . I will be as invisible as humanly possible .
 Your friends won 't even know that I 'm there .
 No , I know . And don 't worry . This isn 't gonna be a high school party .
 Older people are coming . Actually will 's gonna be there .
 Excellent . Yeah , I 'll bring enough bengay for the both of us .
 That 's ... an arthritis ointment .
 Sorry .
 I just tuned out for a second . OK , I just thought of a really great idea .
 Megan , you have a guest downstairs .
 I do ?
 Is it a boy or a girl ?
 Hold on .
 Let me guess .
 It 's Charlie .
 Not really much for games , are you , rami ? Hold that thought .
 Hey .
 You have a butler . Well , not my own personal butler . He comes with the house .
 Did we have plans tonight ?
 No . Just figured it 's easier to catch you in person these days .
 You 're not so great with the phone .
 Oh , crap .
 I totally forgot to call you back .
 A few times , actually .
 Are you mad at me or something ? What ? No , no , no .
 No .
 Why would you think that ? You keep blowing me off ... our surfing lessons , the white stripes concert .
 Scotty gave the tickets away . It doesn 't matter , but seriously , are we not cool ?
 No .
 No , no .
 Of course we are .
 I 'm ...
 I 'm so sorry , Charlie .
 I have been completely wrapped up in my own world , which is no excuse , because you deserve better .
 No worries .
 I just wanted to ... you know , check in . That 's all . Uhh !
 This job is a complete black hole of time suckage .
 Did I tell you that I had to cancel my trip with jacob this weekend just to chaperone the girls ' pool party ?
 I didn 't even know about the trip .
 Well , it 's not happening .
 And of course I can 't bring jacob to the party , because no one knows that we 're dating , and , well , plus I think it would be weird for the girls to see their headmaster in a speedo .
 Oh , if the man wears a speedo , I cannot allow you to date him .
 Anyhoo , it is probably going to be a disaster .
 Luckily will is gonna be there , so hopefully he 'll be helpful . Why would will be there ?
 It 's a party . He 's a billionaire . Those things kinda go hand in hand .
 Well , listen , if you need help , I 'm around .
 No .
 Charlie , I cannot ask you to do that .
 No , I know you can 't . That 's why I 'm offering . It 's no big deal .
 - Really ? - Absolutely . It 'll be fun .
 Charlie , you are my hero . Oh , what would I do without you ?
 Well , she didn 't say I had to cancel my plans , but it was definitely implied .
 So why don 't you just imply that you 'll chaperone the party and not do it ?
 Technically not lying . Please don 't hate me . I feel terrible already .
 What about all the scented oils and the skinny- dipping ?
 Well , look at the bright side . There was never gonna be any skinny- dipping .
 - That 's what you thought .
 - Heh heh .
 Hey , rose . I guess that means you have to go . Yep .
 I 'll call you back . What 's up ?
 OK , OK , so I was thinking about the party , and I came up with this great idea , and I just wanted to run it by you .
 Are we talkin ' themes here ? Because I rock at themes .
 Actually , it 's ... it 's about the guest list .
 I wanted to add one more person . Oh . Oh , I 'm sure that 'll be fine .
 We have plenty of food .
 Ooh , but the thing is I want you to invite her .
 - Your sister Lily .
 - Heh heh . Yeah , right .
 And I hear Charles manson 's up for a parole pretty soon .
 Maybe he wants to catch some rays , too .
 Rose ...
 I 'm not gonna invite Lily . Why not ?
 Look , OK , I know that you two have your stuff to work out , but I mean , she 's still your sister , and I mean , you 're so ...
 I 'm so ... what ?
 You 're so mean to her .
 Iook , I 'm only saying this because you are so nice to everyone else .
 I mean , you are even nice to sage , who kind of wishes you were dead .
 No offense .
 None taken , but ... rose , I 'm not mean to Lily . You were kind of harsh on the phone .
 Well , yeah , but ... and plus you just compared her to a serial killer .
 OK , well , Charles manson was more of a cult leader , but ...
 I get your point .
 Rose , I 've given Lily a lot of chances .
 So give her one more .
 Why is this so important to you ?
 Because you 're my friend , and I just ...
 I want you to be happy .
 I am happy . Yeah , except for when you 're on the phone with your sister and your shoulders clench up past your ears and your voice gets all tight .

 Plus , I think you and me , we have a lot in common .
 You know , like how we both grew up without moms and ... well , even though you had a dad , he obviously wasn 't that great since you never talk to him .


 That 's true .
 So , OK , yeah , Lily , she 's kind of insane , but at least she 's trying .
 And you are always the one that tells me it 's the effort that counts .
 Well , OK .
 I 'll invite her . But I 'm warning you .
 Lily is a disaster . If you wanna invite the bull ... olay√©> baby .
 This is your China shop .
 Oh !
 - OK , good night . - Night .
 Hello . Welcome . Rose and sage are just right outside .
 Hi .
 Welcome .
 - Don 't forget to wear your sunscreen . - Where 's the pool ?
 Oh , uh , it 's just past the patio , across the lawn , and if you hit the ocean , you 've gone too far .
 Holy crap on a stick . Are you kidding me with this place ?
 I got blisters just coming up the driveway . Hey , Lily .
 I 'm glad you could make it . No problem .
 I was pretty surprised to get your message , actually .
 Wasn 't expecting it after you were such a bitch to me on the phone . Try and watch your language , Lily .
 This isn 't one of your biker bars .
 Tell me , does that high horse you sit on ever chafe your ass checks ?

 See ? That wasn 't so bad . Oh , I 'm so proud of you .
 Yay , me .


 Stop scowling , sage . You 'll get wrinkles . Marco , wait .
 You 're not even listening to me ... funny that .
 I see your lips moving , but I can 't hear anything .
 It 's not like anything 's going to happen ... you 're right on that account . I 've already spoken to laurel .
 - But she 's not even here , marco .
 - I have strict orders . No one under 21 drinks alcohol .
 Are you trying to ruin my party ?
 Because this is so unfair . Breckyn ! Jordanna !
 I 'm so glad you guys decided to come .
 Hi .
 Really miss this . Oh , we thought you were mad , but honest , we did not know that laurel was going out of town until last minute .

 Oh , it 's cool . My parents are on safari for another month . We 'll have our party next weekend .
 Oh . You might wanna wait on that a little bit .
 I mean , you wouldn 't want people talking about our party when they 're at your party , right ?
 Heh .
 Oh , look .
 There 's Alexander . Hey , what 's up , ladies ? - Hi .
 - Hi .
 I 'm gonna go say hi .
 Have fun , girls .

 Breckyn , are those new guccis ?
 Aren 't they awesome ? I got them in , like , 5 different colors . Yeah ?
 I have a pair , too . Oh , I meant to tell you .
 Perry called and said he 's going to be late .
 Weren 't you supposed to be goin ' out with the boyfriend this weekend ?
 Heh .
 I know .
 I just couldn 't bear the thought of not chaperoning a baker twins bash .
 And for the record , I wouldn 't call him my boyfriend . Really ?
 What would you call him ? Well , I 'm not really into labels .
 I mean , they aren 't really necessary , are they ?
 I would say that he 's someone whose ... company I enjoy , and it 's progressing nicely .
 You want me to help you with that ? Yes . Heh .
 Thank you .
 So , um , I invited Lily .
 She 's out by the pool . I hope that 's OK .
 Uh , well , yeah , OK .
 Why ... why wouldn 't that be OK ? Oh , I , um ...
 I just wasn 't sure , you know , where you were in the whole label- making process , so ... well , I 'd say that we 're progressing at a much more casual pace than you and jacob , but ... it 'll be good to see her .
 - Good . - Although I am , a little bit surprised .
 Aren 't you guys in a fight ?
 Perpetually .
 Yes , this is all part of my effort to evolve and become a better human being .
 - One more ? - Duty calls . So you just want me to just stick this somewhere in that flower ?
 - This one . - Yeah .
 Hair pinning really isn 't my thing .
 - Oh , no . - ***** hey !
 Sorry to interrupt , but we need a system to figure out who 's over 21 , because no one looks their age , and they 're all asking for drinks .
 I was supposed to be in the spa this weekend .
 Oh , uh , will , Charlie .
 Charlie , will .
 You boys entertain yourself .
 I have to go attend to the future felons of America .
 How you doin ' ?
 Heard a lot of good things about you .
 Yeah , I 've heard about you , too .
 You 're dating Lily , right ? I guess .
 Yeah , we hang out . No , I just couldn 't figure out what she was doing here , but now it makes sense .
 She 's here with you .
 Actually , no .
 Megan invited her . Right . Wait , seriously ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , she said somethin ' about wanting to evolve .
 Oh , no . I take it you don 't think that 's a good thing .
 No , I know it 's not a good thing . Well , I don 't know .
 I thought it was kind of cool . You don 't know them as well as I do .
 Trust me , the two of them aren 't going to evolve anytime soon . Well , if you say so .
 Anyway , it was good to meet you , Charlie .
 I tried to get the drinks , but ... but I told breckyn that she is a guest , and that I would carry 'em over .
 Okey- dokey , we have 3 virgin mojitos , 4 virgin margaritas , and a virgin vodka soda for you , sage , which is pretty much just soda .

 Enjoy .
 Let me know when you want your next round .

 Can someone please just drown her ? No one likes a virgin . Tequila , anyone ?
 - Whoo , yes .
 - Yeah .
 Oh , that flask is so cute .
 Alexander , what would we do without you ?
 - Cheers .
 - Cheers .


 What are you doing in here ?
 Relax . I 'm just looking for a beer .
 Well , the bar 's outside . But the line 's shorter in here . Give me a break , Lily .
 I didn 't invite you over here to get into another fight .
 Then why did you invite me ?
 Sorry .
 Marco just needed some more mint .

 Iook , Lily , I know I 've been hard on you lately .
 " Lately . "
 But I don 't want that to be our dynamic .
 You 're my sister , and I love you .
 I thought it would be nice to show you what I 've been up to for the past few weeks .
 You know , see where I 'm working .

 Want a tour of the house ? OK .
 Oh , my God , you did not .
 - I. c . , I am so glad you could make it . - I wouldn 't have missed it . Who 's that chick with tyler ?
 Ehh . I don 't know , but she 's a total flatso .
 I know , right ? She 's like a human pear .
 Because you 've always way too nice , I. c .
 - So mean .
 - What ?
 You wouldn 't last a day at cielo prep .
 I 'll catch up with you in a bit .

 So , here 's to amazing friends who throw amazing parties .
 Well , I 'll drink to that . Cheers .

 Oh , my God .
 - No way !
 - I know . I could fit my entire apartment - into one of their closets .
 - I know . Here 's what I don 't get . 9, 000 rooms in this house , and the two of them still decide to share ?
 Well , it 's not so weird when you know 'em .
 They 're really close . I guess . God .
 I moved into the garage just to get away from you .
 Yes , despite the asbestos problem .
 Yeah , but I thought it was a fake word you made up . - You did ?
 - I did .
 I thought you were using your fancy vocabulary just to try to freak me out .
 When I got that horrible cough that wouldn 't go away ... oh , yeah .
 I thought you were dying .
 I remember that . You were so nice to me that week .
 Lily ... remember how I used to bounce your mattress from the lower Bunk ?
 Yes , I do .
 I think that 's why I still get seasick .
 Oh , and remember those glow- in- the- dark stars ? Those little stickers you put on the ceiling .
 And you 'd make up those crazy- ass stories .
 Because you were afraid of the dark . You would make me talk to you until you fell asleep .
 I knew you were gonna be a writer , even then .
 I knew .
 So , um ... how did dad take it when he found out I was back ?
 I didn 't tell him .
 Really ?
 Look ...
 I get why you stopped talking to dad .
 He 's a total disaster .
 I just never knew why you stopped talking to me .
 Lily , I ...
 I never meant to shut you out .
 I just ... - *** - excuse me , miss Smith . Your assistance is needed down by the pool .
 - I should go .
 - No worries .
 Iook , I really ...
 I wanna talk to you about this , seriously .
 I 'm really glad you 're here , Lily .
 Go take care of rich people .



 I have to use the bathroom .
 You gonna watch me pee ?
 Here you go .

 Marco , your martinis are almost as good as your omelets .
 I aim to please .
 In fact , you should make a pitcher of these and set it aside for megan . I 'm sure she could use it .
 Megan 's not much of a drinker .
 Oh .
 Didn 't know that . Yep . Lily is .
 OK .
 Oh , I 'm just saying .
 - You know , there 's a ...
 - yeah , what are you sayin ' ?
 - Look at me squeezing limes .
 - Hey , look ,
 I 'm not trying to start anything . You just seem confused . That 's all .
 I mean , which one of the Smith sisters are you interested in ? Or do you like them both ?
 Wow .
 OK .
 Well , I like megan a lot as a friend , which is what we are , and I 'm pretty sure that that 's what you guys are .
 She 's my best friend . Excellent . Glad to hear it .
 So are you worried about her ?
 Should I be ? No .
 Because despite what you think , no one here is confused .
 Megan and I are friends . Lily and I are ... dating casually .
 Not that it 's any of your business , but we 're all pretty clear about the situation .
 In fact , the only one who seems confused right now is you .

 I 'll catch you later , marco .

 Shall I extract your foot from your mouth now , or you would like to keep it in there a bit longer ?
 OK , I don 't wanna jinx anything , but I think this could be our best party ever .
 Did you see megan and Lily ?
 They are totally bonding right now .
 I 'm gonna hurl .
 Uhh .
 I think Alexander put way too much tequila in my drink .
 I could get you some ice cubes .
 I think that helps with the pukey feeling .
 I don 't know .
 I 'm just so dizzy .
 What 's that ?
 What 's what ?
 OK , don 't freak out , but I think something bit you .
 You 've got a thingie on your cheek .
 Oh , my God .
 Oh , my God .
 Oh , my God .
 What is going on with my face ? !
 Look , don 't worry .
 A little makeup will cover it up , right ?
 Oh .
 Iook , if that doesn 't work , we can always put a hello kitty band- aid on it .
 Yeah , I 'll wear one , too .
 We 'll say it 's a theme .
 Oh , my God .
 There 's one on myneck , and it totally itches .
 Don 't itch .
 Don 't itch .
 Don 't itch .
 Oh , no .
 What ?
 Is there one on my back , too ?
 My tennis bracelet , it 's gone .
 They 're getting worse .
 Megan , we need you !
 Intercom .
 Freaks me out every time .
 OK , this looks a little weird .
 OK , a few things have happened that are kind of bad .
 First of all , I 'm dying .
 You 're what ?
 Oh .
 Those are just hives .
 How do you know ?
 Because I 've had them before , and it looks like a pretty mild allergic reaction .
 Good thing is you 're not swollen .
 What 'd you eat today ?
 Nothing .
 All have had today was carrot sticks .
 And buckets full of alcohol .
 Yeah , but I know I 'm not allergic to tequila , so that can 't be it .
 Who gave you tequila ?
 Oh , my God .
 Megan , we really need to focus on the big issues right now .
 Guess what !
 You girls drinking is a big issue !
 I can 't believe that you would go behind my back like this .
 OK , somebody stole my tennis bracelet .
 What ?
 It 's a diamond bracelet .
 - You don 't actually play tennis with it .
 I know what a tennis bracelet ... what do you mean someone stole it ?
 - Wait .
 I don 't know .
 It 's missing .
 I always put it in the same place , and it 's gone .
 I 'm telling you , it 's gotta be that new housekeeper .
 She 's totally shady .
 It 's not the new housekeeper .
 Damn it .
 We 'll discuss you girls drinking later .
 OK ?
 And I 'll have marco bring up some calamine lotion .
 - Wait !
 - What ?
 Is that gonna give me zits ?
 Charlie , get everyone 's drinks .
 - Are you serious ?
 - Someone 's spiking the punch , and I don 't have time here to figure out who can drink , nor is it my top priority , so all cups must be redeemed .
 OK , calm down .
 What happened ?
 What happened ?
 The girlare getting wasted .
 Sage 's face has exploded for reasons that I don 't yet understerstand .
 But right now , I 've gotta go kill Lily .
 - I 'll take care of the drinks .
 - Thank you .
 Iook , I don 't wanna make a scene .
 Just give back the bracelet and go .
 I 'm not gonna call the cops , and nobody has to know .
 Just give it back , OK ?
 - What are you ...
 - rose 's bracelet .
 I left you upstairs alone in their room , and you stole it .
 Ah , here 's the megan I know and love .
 Welcome back .
 I can 't believe you would do this to me .
 I didn 't do anything to you .
 Don 't walk away from me .
 Screw you .
 I 'm not gonna stay here and be attacked .
 I 'm not gonna let you steal from people that I care about .
 I love how you care about them !
 I 've tried to care about you , Lily , but you make it impossible .
 I go out of my way to be nice to you , to give you an opportunity .
 Opportunity ? !
 Yes , an opportunity to act like a grown- up , to prove that you could be a good sister .
 I don 't have to prove myself to you or to anyone else .
 Unlike you , I don 't give a crap what anybody here thinks of me .
 I mean , you 're so desperately trying to fit in , it 's pathetic .
 You wanna spend the rest of your life kissing ass and trying to make rich people like you ?
 - That 's your problem .
 - No .
 You 're my problem .
 You always have been , and you 're never gonna change .
 And you lie , and you cheat , and you steal , and you expect me to cover up for you .
 Well , I am done .
 I want you gone .
 I 'm leaving .
 Yeah , not just from this party , Lily .
 I want you out of my life .
 I want you out of my life forever .
 You 're being so lame .
 My au pair let 's me do it , like , all the time .
 Seriously .
 It 's just an ice tea .
 Really ? 'cause it smells like it 's from long Island .
 Ooh .
 You mean like the hamptons ?
 Sage ?
 Oh , my God .
 Iook at her face .
 This is so classic .
 Where 's my cell phone ?
 I have to take a picture .
 I 'm having an allergy attack .
 It 's no big deal .
 I love it .
 This is so much better than we even thought it would be .
 What are you talking about ?
 Yeah , what are you talking about ?
 OK , so don 't be mad , but we spiked your drink .
 You did what ? !
 Oh , you totally deserved it .
 You know you did .
 Wait .
 Wh ... what did you put in her drink ?
 Oh , it wasn 't anything bad , just some muscle relaxers I found in my mother 's medicine cabinet .
 Yeah .
 They were just supposed to make her mellow out .
 - Smile .
 - Oh , you bitches are so dead !
 Wow , wow , OK . *****
 ****
 ******* stop , stop !
 What 's going on here ?
 Don 't look at me .
 The girls have officially gone wild .
 What are you doing ?
 They tried to poison me !
 - Only because she stole our party .
 - Oh , whatever .
 Enough !
 Enough !
 The case of sage 's exploding face has officially been solved .
 Apparently betty and Veronica here thought it would be a good idea to put muscle relaxers in sage 's drink .
 Do you know how dangerous that is ?
 You girls could have killed her .
 - Sorry .
 - Sorry .
 I don 't understand this .
 I thought you guys were friends .
 - We are friends .
 - Yeah .
 Or hijack each other 's parties just because they can .
 You girls wanna know what a real friend is ?
 This guy right here .
 You think Charlie wanted to spend his Saturday monitoring your alcohol intake ?
 No .
 He had way better things to do , but he 's here because of me , and that 's what friendship is all about , ladies .
 It 's about being there for the other person when they need you most .
 It 's about loyalty .
 Kind of sounds like having a dog .
 It kinda does .
 You know what ?
 All right .
 Party 's over .
 - What ?
 - But it 's so early .
 We 'll do the picnic on the next time .
 Let 's go .
 Move it out .
 Come on .
 Let 's go .
 Ugh , you are being so lame .
 Nobody would have shut down our party .
 - Shut up , jordanna !
 - No , you shut up !
 Can you believe it ?
 Megan is sending everyone home .
 Who cares ?
 This party is a total disaster anyway .
 I don 't think it 's a total disaster .
 Yes , it is .
 I mean , your face looks like pizza , and I 've permanently destroyed megan and Lily 's relationship .
 They 're probably never even gonna speak to each other again .
 I 'm sorry .
 How is that your fault ?
 Because if I hadn 't told megan to invite Lily , none of this would have happened .
 Please .
 You didn 't know Lily was gonna turn out to be a criminal .
 I know .
 It was just a stupid bracelet .
 I got so crazy .
 You know , I would never let a piece of jewelry come between you and me .
 Well , that 's the difference between us and them .
 People like megan and Lily never had nice things , so when they finally get something shiny , they think it 's more important than their own family .
 Maybe .
 I never made such a big deal about it .
 I mean , look .
 I 've gote 11 other tennis bracelets , and I 'm always loaning 'em out , so it 's not like I need them .
 I mean , seriously half the time , I have no idea who has what .
 Oh , wait .
 Where are you going ?
 Doesn 't look like pizza .
 Good God , it 's chaos out there .
 Drinking alone ?
 - I 'm an idiot .
 - Oh , don 't be silly .
 I keep a bottle of cabernet under my pillow for those just- for- me nights .
 And the fact that I didn 't realize I 'm an idiot until now , makes me an even bigger idiot .
 OK .
 I guess marco won 't be getting his quiet time .
 What 's the matter , Charles ?
 I 'm her friend .
 And why is that a bad thing ?
 That 's all I am to her , and it 's all I 'll ever be .
 OK , so what are you doing about it ?
 Nothing .
 - I mean , she 's happy , right ?
 - Seems that way .
 Right .
 So ...
 I don 't wanna be the guy who messes with his friend 's relationship .
 But I also don 't wanna be the guy separating drunk 16- year- olds at some stupid pool party , hoping his friend will notice him .
 Right ?
 This is where you jump in and say , " no , it 's definitely gonna happen .
 Hang in there , buddy . "
 There 's nothing worse than unrequited love , except of course losing your hairline in your twenties waiting for that person to love you back .
 I missed my window , didn 't I ?
 Thanks for the talk , man .
 Megan !
 I need to talk to you .
 Rose , the party is over , and do not mess with me right now , because I am pissed off , and you don 't wanna mess with me when I 'm pissed off .
 OK , Lily didn 't steal the bracelet .
 What ?
 I j ...
 I just remembered that my friend precious really needed something to wear to the fire and ice ball , and look , she begged me to borrow it , and I ...
 I guess she never returned it .
 Are you kidding me ?
 How could you not remember something like that ?
 I don 't know .
 Just I have so many , I guess I lost track .
 Oh , my God .
 I can 't believe this .
 I know .
 I am so sorry .
 OK ?
 Just please ask Lily to come back here , and I really need to apologize .
 This is all my fault .
 Lily .
 Lily , please .
 What do you want ?
 Would you mind if I , uh , talked to my sister alone for a minute , please ?
 Yeah .
 Of course .
 Don 't go .
 I don 't wanna be alone with you right now .
 Iook , I 'm ...
 I just wanted to say that I 'm sorry for accusing you of taking the bracelet .
 Rose remembered that she loaned it to a friend , and I feel awful , and I don 't know why ...
 I was so quick to think that you took it .
 It 's obviously something that I need to work on , but I want you to know that , um ,
 I 'm embarrassed , and ...
 I 'm so , so sorry , and I just ...
 I just hope that you can forgive me .
 I 'd like to .
 But " I 'm sorry " means nothing coming from you .
 I was so excited that you invited me today .
 I actually thought that things might be different .
 But you 're never gonna stop judging me , and you know what ?
 I 'm over it .
 You want me out of your life , I 'm gone .
 I 'll meet you at the place , will .
 You must think I 'm a terrible person .
 I try not to judge when I don 't have all the details , but you were pretty hard on her out there .
 I mean , it 's obvious that your sister likes to act tough , but underneath , I think she 's pretty vulnerable .
 I ...
 I wish you were right , but I know my sister .
 Just look at what happened here today .
 Now , I may not know everything that went down with you guys in the past , but I saw this one from start to finish .
 This one 's all on you .
 Hey .
 You 're not leaving , too .
 Sorry .
 I gotta get goin ' .
 I 'm supposed to meet up with some friends from work .
 Don 't tell me you 're mad at me about the whole Lily thing , too .
 No , of course not .
 Really ?
 You don 't think I was too hard on her .
 It 's not like she hasn 't given you reason to be that way .
 Makes total sense you jumped to that conclusion .
 I would have done the same thing .
 Well , then stay .
 Hang out with me .
 We could do whatever you want .
 I really gotta get goin ' , megan .
 OK .
 Call me tomorrow ?
 Sure .
 Hey .
 How 'd it go with your sister ?
 Did you guys make up ?
 Not exactly .
 I think it 's gonna be a long time before she talks to me .
 Ah , I feel so bad .
 I made you invite her here today , and now everything 's ruined between you two forever .
 I ...
 No .
 No , you didn 't make me do anything , rose .
 Tried to tell her that .
 The damage between me and Lily goes a long way back it 's gonna take more than one party invitation to fix it , if it can ever be fixed .
 But it 's OK .
 How is that OK ?
 I mean , she 's the only family you talk to , and she hates you .
 Yeah .
 That may be true for now , but luckily I don 't depend on my sister for too much , which is why my friendships are so important to me .
 And after seeing the way that you and your friends treat each other ,
 I understand why that concept might be a little foreign to you .
 Heh .
 What are you talking about ?
 We love our friends .
 Yeah .
 I mean , breckyn and jo are the best .
 They tried to poison you .
 Agreed .
 They did go a little far this time ,
 - but they did apologize .
 - Yeah , and they felt really bad .
 I mean , that counts for a lot .
 Maybe this is all a little over my head , but for the record , I think it 's really sad that you girls don 't have friends that you could share everything with , that you can depend on , you know , for the big stuff .
 We don 't need our friends for that .
 That 's why we have each other .
 Yeah , exactly .
 Hmm .
 All right .
 I 'm gonna hit the hay .
 Good night , girls .
 Night , megan .
 Don 't forget to call precious .
 Hmm ?
 What for ?
 To get your bracelet back .
 Oh .
 Right .
 First thing tomorrow .
 Can I help ?
 Or can I go dig myself a ditch in the backyard and bury myself in it ?
 Don 't be silly .
 We have people here to dig the ditch for you .
 Why so gloomy , red ?
 I 'm not gloomy .
 I don 't know .
 It 's just ... it 's kind of tough having zero relationship with my sister and then seeing what it could be like .
 They 're really sweet with each other .
 Well , they have to be .
 Who else is gonna like them ?
 Megan .
 You have a guest waiting for you in your room .
 Don 't you wanna ask me if it 's a boy or a girl ?
 Not really , rami , but I appreciate the effort .
 Jasmine or sweet almond ?

 You know what ?
 Let 's just forget today ever happened .
 I 'm working on it .
 Tonight is all about drinking ourselves stupid .
 Please .
 I could drink your skinny ass under the table .
 - Oh , yeah ?
 - Mmm .
 You are so on .
