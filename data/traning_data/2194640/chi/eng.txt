 00 : 00 : 00, 847 -- > 00 : 00 : 02, 631 The Big Bang Theory ... OTHERS :
 We now pronounce you husband and wife !
 ( loud rumbling ) I love this part !
 Me , too !
 I have strongly mixed feelings !
 So , Howard 's really in space , huh ?
 Mm- hmm , International Space Station .
 250 miles that way .
 Right now , Howard 's staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god .
 Zeusowitz . SHELDON :
 I must admit , I can 't help but feel a twinge of envy .
 He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes .
 His dim , uncomprehending eyes .
 It 's like a cat in an airport carrying case .
 You know , it 's not exactly glamorous up there .
 The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other 's recycled urine .
 Must be nice .
 Nobody wants anything that comes out of
 ( sighs ) :
 I wonder what he 's doing right this very second .
 Mm , conducting experiments in zero gravity .
 Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos .
 Whatever it is , we know his life will never be the same .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 I can hear you the phone !
 Don 't be snippy .
 I 'm just excited to talk to my baby !
 I 'm excited to talk to you , too .
 So , what 's this about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl ? !
 How about calling her my wife ?
 Wives don 't take boys from their mothers .
 They do .
 That 's why we marry them !
 I just hope I 'm not dead from a broken heart before you get back .
 Ma , please .
 Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call . Good .
 They should know what a horrible son you are !
 Okay , Ma , great talking to you ! Gotta go !
 ( sighs )

 Original Air Date on September 27 , 2012

 This is so exciting .
 Soon , my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend .
 Hey , this is my natural hair color .
 Now .
 So , does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night ?
 Oh , yes .
 According to the Relationship Agreement , on the anniversary of our first date , he must take me to a nice dinner , ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy .
 That 's hot .
 You kids better use protection .
 How long does this stay on ?
 Just a couple of minutes . You 've really never done this before ?
 Once in high school , but I dozed off and woke up with second- degree chemical burns on my face .
 Oh , my gosh , that 's awful . The other kids make fun of you ?
 No , I had a cover story ; I told everyone it was herpes .
 So , how 's everything going with you and Leonard ?
 ( sighs ) : I don 't know , it 's still kind of weird .
 We haven 't really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex .
 Oh . Boo- hoo .
 If Sheldon proposed to me during sex , my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go .
 Leonard , where do you stand on the anthropic principle ?
 Interesting question . On the one hand , I always thought ...
 You don 't even know what it is , do you ?
 The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does , the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question .
 As I am doing so eloquently right now .
 I know what the anthropic principle is .
 Of course .
 I just explained it to you .
 Now , where do you stand on it ?
 Where do you stand on it ? Strongly pro .
 Then I believe that God created the world in six days , and on the seventh , he made you to annoy me .

 Hey , guys . Hey .
 Yeah , wait , Raj , where do you stand on the anthropic principle ?
 I 'm all for it . Attaboy !
 Well , hang on .
 Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don 't ? Oh , Leonard .
 Let 's not take a saw to the branch we 're sitting on , shall we ?
 Hey , uh , if you guys are free tonight , I heard about a spa where you soak your feet in a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them .
 I don 't need to tell you , in Los Angeles , sandal season is year round .
 Actually , I 'm hanging out with Penny .
 Oh , okay .
 Sounds like it 's me and you , Sheldon .
 How about we sic some guppies on those puppies ?
 As I 've stated before on numerous occasions , the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken , because the last words I would hear are :
 " Release the Kraken . "
 That never gets old .
 " Release the Kraken ! " Oh , chills .
 Besides , I 'm having dinner with Amy .
 Oh , okay .
 I 'll just go home and be alone . W- Which is cool .
 I eat alone , I sleep alone , I cry alone , so ...
 Cool . Darn .
 If you weren 't busy , I 'd ask you to join us . Really ?
 I can come ? Thanks !
 Sheldon , are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy ?
 Oh , absolutely .
 I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact , but nowhere is it specified that I can 't outsource that to an Indian .

 BERNADETTE :
 Howie ? Howie ?
 Hey , there 's my beautiful bride !
 Can you see me ?
 I can .
 How are you ? ( chuckles ) : I 'm amazing .
 I mean , this is even better than I dreamed .
 I look out the window , and ... it 's all so unbelievable .
 Good for you .
 I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom .
 Oh , yeah ?
 That 's nice . It was .
 Until I found out you never told her we 're not gonna live with her .
 Let 's talk about for a minute .
 Hey , look , this pen is floating .
 How crazy is that ?

 You said you told her , but you never did !
 Okay , okay , I know you 're upset , but ...
 let me share something I 've learned since I got here . You realize how small your problems are when you 're looking down on them from space .
 ( chuckles )
 Now , come on , that 's got to make you feel better .
 How clear is the image of me on that screen ?
 Pretty clear .
 Do I like I feel better ?
 I mean , it 's not , like , HD quality .
 Listen , mister , you 're gonna talk to your mother and you 're gonna fix this , or that thing I said
 I was gonna do to you the minute you got home , you can do to yourself . ( Russian accent ) :
 Like he 's been doing since he got here .
 Sheldon , this place is so romantic .
 Oh , I 'm glad you like it .
 Raj picked it out .
 Well , when you see him , tell him I say thank you .
 Tell him yourself .
 Yoo- hoo !
 Over here ! I don 't understand .
 What 's he doing here ?
 I invited him . On our date ?
 Sheldon , that 's not okay .
 Yes , it is .
 There 's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement .
 You found a loophole ?
 Sorry I started without you .
 I 'm a little nervous .
 It 's been a long time since I 've been on a date .
 I can 't believe I bleached my mustache for this .
 You should go to my girl .
 She 'll knock out those sideburns for free .

 You know , Amy , I don 't even think you and I have had a real conversation .
 Let 's use tonight to get to know each other a little better .
 You start .
 Go home .
 I don 't understand .
 Sheldon , how could you do this ?
 It 's our second anniversary . It 's your anniversary ? !
 Oh , my God , I had no idea .
 Amy , please , let me make this right .
 Thank you . My pleasure . Waiter ?
 A bottle of champagne and three glasses .
 Oh , boy , isn 't this romantic ?
 Oh , I hope that 's a rhetorical question , because I have no clue .

 This is great . What 's the occasion ?
 No occasion .
 You know , things have been a little weird between us , so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you .
 That is so sweet .
 I got all your favorites .
 Beer , wings , sliders . We can watch the football game .
 I even painted my stomach .
 " Go sports " ?
 Well ... in case you were in the mood for baseball ,
 I didn 't want to look ridiculous .
 This is awesome . I love it ! Good , I 'm glad .
 Gosh , I worked my ass off today .
 This is exactly what I needed .
 Great .
 Just relax and enjoy .
 Tonight is all about you . Ah , thank you !
 ( chuckles , sighs )
 So , where exactly are we in this relationship ?
 Oh , come on !
 I just told you I had a hard day . You 're right , I 'm sorry . Let 's watch the game .
 Great .
 ( sighs )
 I just know the longer we wait to talk about it , the weirder it gets .
 Sweetie , can I just be the girl tonight ?
 Absolutely . You 're the girl , I 'm the guy .
 Now , you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here .
 Thank you !
 ( knocking ) Oh , I 'll get it .
 Go sports !
 ( chuckles )
 Hello- lo- lo .
 What are you doing here ? I thought you were out th Sheldon and Amy .
 I was , but it 's their anniversary and I didn 't want to be a third wheel , so I figured I 'd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date .
 Well , it 's not really a great time .
 Penny and I have some things we need to talk about . No , we don 't !
 Come on in !
 Sweet !
 ( quietly ) :
 I can 't believe I shaved my stomach for this .
 Hey , Froot Loops .
 You got a phone call .
 Who is it ?
 A woman who says she 's your mother but sounds like your father .

 Hey , Ma .
 You know , we could see each other if you turn on the computer .
 I 'm not going near that fakakta thing .
 I 'll catch a computer virus !
 You can 't catch a computer virus .
 Oh , so now you 're an astronaut a doctor ? ( voice cracks ) :
 What do you want , Ma ?
 Your wife says you have something important to tell me . Okay , here it is .

 Bernadette and I are starting a life together and ...
 Oh , God ! You gonna leave me ! Ma ...
 It 's okay .
 Your father left me , you left me --
 I guess I 'm just the kind of person people like to leave .
 It 's not ... definite .
 I 'll talk to Bernadette .
 Don 't bother .
 I 'll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I 'm no trouble when I die .
 Stop it , Ma .
 I 'm sure I can get Bernie to come around . I knew it !
 I knew she was behind this !
 You listen to me , if you want to be a man , you can 't let a woman tell you what to do !
 Okay , okay .
 ( sighs ) I can 't believe these people won the Cold War .
 Now , can we please change the subject ?
 Fine .


 ( TV sports announcer talking )
 You know , I 'm growing to like American football .
 Yeah , it 's fun , isn 't it ?
 Well ... it 's not the balls- to- the- wall action of badminton or cricket , but hey ... what is ?
 All right , who 's ready for another beer ? I 'm good . No , thank you .
 Girls .
 ( sighs ) :
 I am having the nicest time .
 You guys are like family to me . You know that , right ?
 That 's great . Get out .
 What ?
 Why ?
 Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about .
 Oh ... pish on your issues !
 You guys are fine . Yes , you hit some bumps along the way .
 I mean , Penny , you 've always known how this man has felt about you , but you made him grovel for affection .
 Okay , hold on ... Now , don 't blame yourself . He was a groveler from way back .
 But the point is , the two of you got past it .
 And , Leonard , you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex ?
 That was some weak tea , dude .
 Some people might say it was romantic .
 Yeah , no .
 But yet , here you two are , still together .
 And that 's even after you and I had our crazy naked night . Okay ... That 's enough .
 I 'm just saying that after everything you 've been through , you get to look into each other 's eyes and say " I love you . "
 And that 's beautiful .
 Actually , to this day , she 's never really said it .
 Oh , Penny !
 That 's ridiculous !
 You know you love him !
 You look him in the eyes and you say it .
 Raj ...
 Oh , come on , you know you want to say it . Say it .
 Say you love him .
 Say it !
 I really thought she would say it .

 Have I ever told you you 're like a sexy praying mantis ?
 Every time you drink alcohol .
 You know what 's wonderful about the praying mantis ?
 They devour their mate .
 Your point being ?

 Dessert is served .
 I just had cobbler .
 You know what ?
 I 'm done with this .

 W- Where are you going ?
 I 'm leaving . You can 't leave . I need you .
 You do ?
 Yes . You 're my ride .
 Sheldon , you either say something meaningful and from the heart , or you and I are done .
 All right .
 Please .
 Amy ... when I look in your eyes and you 're looking back in mine , everything feels not quite normal , because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time .
 I feel excited and , at the same time , terrified .
 The truth is ,
 I don 't know what I feel , except ...
 I know what kind of man I want to be .
 Sheldon ... that was beautiful .
 I should hope so .
 That 's from the first Spider- Man movie .

 I 'll take it .
 Good .
 Now , I assume we 're splitting the check ?


 Hey , Stuart .
 Oh , hey .
 I was actually just about to close up .
 Oh , I 'm sorry .
 I 'll leave . No , no . It 's okay .
 Hang out . You sure ?
 Yeah , you 're my first customer today .
 All right . Great .
 I 'm , uh , having a nightcap .
 You want to join me ?
 What are you drinking ?
 Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug .
 I call it a sad- tini .
 Perfect for the night I 'm having .
 Thank you . Hmm . Nice not to drink alone .
 Amen to that .
 Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog 's water bowl .
 You 're kidding .
 She 's kind of a mean drunk , but what are you gonna do ?
 Cheers .
 Cheers .
 A little music ? Sure .
 ( soft Brazilian jazz playing )
 Mmm .
 Bossa nova .
 You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears . Mmm .
 Oh .
 Something about ...
 Latin music just makes me feel like
 I 'm on a white sand beach in Rio . Yeah .
 The sun , the waves , the beautiful bodies , tanned and glistening with sweat .
 ( Brazilian jazz continues )


 I should go .
 Yeah .
 Uh , thank you for the drink .
 No problem .
 ( sighs ) Hey , Stuart . Yeah ?
 Do you want to ... hang out tomorrow night , maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie ?
 Yeah , I- I 'd like to , but I 'm a little tight on funds .
 No problem .
 My treat .
 I 'll swing by after work .
 Okay .
 Okay .
 I could do worse .



 BERNADETTE :

 Hey , I 'm a grown man ; I 'm gonna live with my wife .
 My mother 's just gonna have to learn to make do on her own .
 Was she upset ?
 Who can tell ?
 She yells everything .
 She might have been upset .
 She might have been hungry .
 Thanks for fixing it . I love you .
 I love you , too .
 Sweet dreams .
 I 'll talk to you tomorrow ?
 Good night , Rocket Man .
 To infinity and beyond , baby .
 ( clicks tongue )
 Loops .
 You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife your mother .
 I know .
 What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth ?
 Oh , I 'm never going back .
