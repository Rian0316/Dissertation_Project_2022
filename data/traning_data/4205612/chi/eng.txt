 Okay , Max .
 How would you describe our apartment ?
 And I 've already ruled out worse than that girl- pit in
 Well , at least she had some silence once in a while .
 Look , no one 's gonna pay money to rent this dump .
 We haven 't in six months .
 Everyone else in Williamsburg is making money renting their crappy places on Airbnb .
 It 's all how you describe it .
 So let 's start lying .
 This is a fantastic idea and I really want to do this .
 First question : " Describe your neighborhood . "

 Run- down with a bunch of rats .
 Old- world charm .
 Pet- friendly .
 " What type of people live there ? "
 Junkies , whores , homeless .
 Actors .
 " Do you have a hot tub ? "
 Sometimes .
 " Gym ? "
 Two .
 Gay Jim upstairs , and straight Jim across the hall who 's only gay when he 's drunk .
 " When is your space available ?
 Always , sometimes , one time . "
 Oh , just like our sex lives .
 Always for me , sometimes out of boredom , and one time for you .

 Earl , guess what Max and I did .
 I know what you didn 't do .
 Clean this dessert carousel .
 There 's a Napoleon in here since Napoleon .
 We rented our apartment on Airbnb .
 You rented to Arabs ?
 Well , good luck getting it back .
 They tend to be a tad territorial .
 Airbnb is an agency that rents to out- of- towners and I 'm guessing local men cheating on their wives .
 Well , I did it .
 I know .
 When you were 18 with Prince Harry .
 Or so you say .
 We have three offers for our apartment .
 How ?
 Let me rephrase that .
 How !
 I found the perfect sales pitch .
 " Stay at the place where dreams die " ?
 " Have the authentic Williamsburg experience "
 Oh , you mean getting clumsily felt up by a guy who looks like he came from the gold rush ?
 Anyone can stay at a hotel .
 But how often can you say you went to New York and stayed at a " Brooklyn bohemian barn apartment with a live- in horse " ?
 Girl , you are good .
 So now we just have to pick who gets our apartment .
 A guy looking to get away from it all . that 's a suicide .
 You 're right . We lie , they lie .
 Um , a married couple looking to reconnect .
 Murder- suicide .
 And finally , a girls ' getaway weekend for some fashion model friends .
 A couple of chubby girls looking to murder some pints of Ben and Jerry 's .
 With maybe a sui- side of mac and cheese .
 Hey , everybody .
 Yeah , the temperature be droppin ' and the bitches be nippin ' .
 I need a hot chocolate .
 I 'm right here , Sophie .
 And I 'm right here , Earl .
 I mean , I get it , but bro code , man .
 Well , big news .
 I 'm going on a trip .
 Mushrooms or acid ?
 I 'm going to vermont !
 Oh , you 're gonna be gone ?
 Would you mind letting us stay upstairs at your place ?
 We 're renting out our apartment .
 You 're renting out that dump ?
 Oh , are they filming at your place ?
 [ coughing ]
 So when are these losers arriving ?
 They 're not losers .
 They 're just girls paying us to have a fun weekend
 In our apartment .
 What losers !
 [ knock at door ]
 Now that is a hand that 's scooped some ice cream .
 Hi , are you Caroline ?
 Oh , my God .
 They really are models .
 Hi , I 'm Lily .
 Oh shoot , now I 'm gay .
 Lily ? As in Lily Aldridge ?

 And I 'm Martha .
 Hunt ? Martha Hunt and Lily Aldridge ?


 Max , do you know who they are ?
 Sure do .
 This one is the girl that I leave this one for .
 No , Max , they 're all Victoria 's Secret models . Yeah , we all wanted to hang out in New York before we leave for London .
 We 're doing a fashion show there .
 I worked at the Victoria 's Secret at the mall for one day .
 Got fired for eating panda express over the thongs .
 This is Max . I 'm Caroline .
 I used to be rich .
 I just felt like I needed to say that .
 And these are our friends , Petra , Gabriella , and Rina .
 ( all three ) Hi .
 What are the odds you 're all named after Columbus 's ships .
 Come in . Welcome to " The Williamsburg Experience . "

 It 's bigger than it looks in the photo .
 Well , I shaved of a couple of inches for the photo .
 You know the drill .
 So why the hell are you staying here ?
 Is this training for when your looks run out ?
 Oh , look .
 The kitchen is so cute !
 Question :
 How do you walk the runway blind ?
 It 's just that we stay at the same Four Seasons all the time .
 Well , you will experience at least two seasons here ,
 ' cause the thermostat 's broken .
 It 's 40 outside and 100 in here .
 So as advertised , this is our sauna .
 And our bohemian barn 's right out that door .
 Just follow the temperature drop .
 Max , super models are staying at our apartment .
 It 's so exciting , I want to tell all my friends .
 I guess I just did .
 I see you met Chestnut .
 That 's his real mane , not extensions .
 Also per our ad , a charming skylight .
 In case you want to sit under the stars and have a little peace and quiet .
 Hey , girls !
 Come up already .
 I want to get to my college reunion . can you believe it 's been 10 years ?
 Wow , time sure does lie ...
 I mean , fly .
 ( Martha ) You talk to your neighbors ?
 I talked to my neighbor once and the next thing you know ,
 I have this long letter from Naomi Watts saying , " leave my husband alone . "
 So we 've known each other like five minutes already .
 Where 's my free bra ?
 I mean , all that 's left of this one is the frames .
 Trust me , it 's like a burlesque show under here .
 Sophie 's apartment is amazing .
 It looks like an Easter bunny banged a Golden Girl .
 That was some showerhead .
 I 'd marry it , but it 's already attached ... to the wall .
 Max ?
 Here !
 Oh , this bed is like being in the womb without all the second- hand smoke .
 Martha and Lily were super- sweet .
 So exciting to be back hanging with celebrities .
 Yeah , and maybe now you can get a new celebrity story .
 I was getting really tired of hearing how someone thought you were Gwyneth Paltrow from behind .
 Still flattering .
 [ laughter ]
 Laughter ?
 Coming from our apartment ?
 What do you think they 're laughing at ?
 Probably found our account balance on an ATM slip .
 I bet Martha said something funny .
 She 's hilarious .
 You know , for someone who 's so pretty , she never had to develop a personality .
 I 'm gonna go see .
 Max , give me a shove .
 This is good practice for the eventual cliff .
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 ( Lily ) Beers and wings .
 ( Martha ) Beers and wings .
 Now it 's a party .
 Max , you know how when it gets hot down there , we just sit , sweat , and point the fan at our junk ?
 They do it a little differently .
 They are dancing in their underwear , drinking beers .
 So ?
 The guy on the corner does that all the time .
 [ models toasting beers ]
 I can 't take my eyes off those beers .
 ( lily ) Hey !
 Hi , you guys .
 ( lily ) you wanna come down , and have some beers ,
 And cool off ?
 Be right down !
 Now I wish I had those wings , I could get down there faster .
 Okay .
 So what is this big news ?
 Did the health inspector find out that the imitation crab meat is cat ?
 Technically , it 's imitation cat , but that 's not what we 're announcing .
 I 'm here .
 And make this snappy .
 I 'm in the middle of something .
 Puberty ?
 I was on a call with to inform them that you still work here .
 No .
 And they didn 't believe it .
 Okay .
 We have some friends coming in for a meal and we don 't want you guys to embarrass us and overreact .
 Darlin ' , I don 't overreact .
 I 'm 70- something years old with a history of heart trouble .
 I keep it in check .
 Hey , Max !

 And I keep my heart pills in my pocket .
 Excuse me , much as I enjoy the view ,
 I really want that " 100th birthday " shout out from Al Roker .
 Yes , they 're Victoria 's Secret models and our friends .
 Last night we all stayed up late trashing Kate Moss .
 Models in my diner !
 Oh , no . I wore the wrong sweater vest .

 You also wore the wrong face , body , and personality .
 Max , let 's go say hi .
 How do I look ?
 Like a waitress .
 Damn it , it 's the waitress uniform , isn 't it ?
 What 's up , homies ?
 What 's up , homie ?
 I love my life again .
 Well , it 's been a whole day since we met , so where 's that free bra ?
 Max !
 What ?
 This one 's on it 's last legs .
 Last night I heard it coughing .
 Could also use some new underwear .
 Mine are running on fumes .
 I just texted David .
 He 's coming .
 This is going to be an amazing party .
 - Party ?
 - Yeah .
 We 're having some friends over .
 Cool .
 - Yeah ? - Yeah .

 And like Max said , " cool "
 Jeez , pull it back .
 You 're acting needier than Sofia Vergara on a red carpet .
 Big fan .
 Big , big fan .
 Compliments of the chef .
 My specialty , popsicles .
 I find they taste best when sucked slowly , using plenty of tongue , facing the kitchen .
 I can 't believe we 're not invited to the biggest party in our apartment since those ants found your jelly beans .
 Yoo- hoo !
 Hi , so we 're just up here hangin ' out .
 Doin ' our thang .
 ( Lily ) Oh , sorry , girl .
 Did we wake you ?
 Go back to sleep .
 " Go back to sleep " ?
 Why does she think we 're so lame ?
 Um , I don 't know .
 Maybe it 's 'cause you 're throwing around words
 like " yoo- hoo " and " thang , " like a mom bringing cheetos down to a slumber party .
 This is your fault .
 They were obsessed with us until you started asking for bras like some bra- less homeless person .
 We 're never gonna sleep with all that music .
 Check the drawer , Sophie must have ear plugs .
 I mean , she lives upstairs from you .
 I found plugs , but I don 't think they 're for your ears .
 It 's fine , we 'll just pop downstairs and say hello .
 Fashion 's my scene .
 Know what I 'm seeing ? That price tag .

 Oh , tuck it back in , I have to return it .
 Okay . Remember our deal .

 I got up and got dressed so you 're my slave for life .
 Oh , hi , girls .
 I thought you were the man with the Greek food .
 Wow , I have definitely got to start waxing my upper lip more .
 Sophie , why aren 't you in Vermont ?
 Oh , I lied .
 I didn 't go to vermont .
 I mean , it 's far and I 'm not a lesbian .
 No , I stayed in town to spy on Oleg .
 I mean , I know you girls think that I 'm perfect , but I have trust issues .
 Well then , whose apartment is that ?
 I 'm staying at Jim 's .
 Straight Jim 's or gay Jim 's ?
 Sophie , you forgot your purse .
 Oh , I think this is mine .
 Just kidding , it 's yours .
 What 's up , salt n ' pepa ?
 ( both ) Gay Jim 's .
 Oh , girls , please don 't tell Oleg that I 'm here .
 You know , I 've been following him around to see what he would do if I was not in town .
 And so far , you know , he 's been cool .
 But you know the old saying :
 " Cheat on me once , shame on you .
 Cheat on me twice , your balls are in a jar . "
 Oh , my God ! There 's a man standing in our doorway .

 I have a doorman again .
 Weird to see a man standing in our doorway without a warrant , an eviction notice , or a bible .
 Excuse me , this is our apartment .
 Yeah , we live here all the time .
 No biggie .
 No biggie , and no electricity , no lease- y .
 Hi , I 'm Caroline . This is Max .

 We live here .
 Not according to the list .
 Sir , look , we do live her . I have a key .
 The key is to be on the list , which you are not .
 Okay , I can prove we live here .
 Go over to the window , kick the side of radiator , a panel will open up .
 You 'll find a half- smoked joint and another half- smoked joint .
 Proving ...
 What ?
 That you 're a poor pot head ?
 This is crazy .
 I can 't believe I 'm begging to get into a place
 I 've been trying to get out of .
 It 's a very exclusive party .
 It 's a dump .
 I should know . I live here .

 ( Caroline ) This night couldn 't get any worse .
 Turn that light off .
 I 'm watching the Vctoria 's Secret super model party with my night vision goggles .
 And updating .
 Oleg , how did you get in here ?
 How do you think ?
 It 's my girlfriend 's apartment .
 I broke in .
 Yes , Oleg , it 's your girlfriend 's apartment where you 're sitting in the dark , watching models out the window with night vision goggles .
 Hey ! My pants are on !


 No , they are not !
 Not my fault .
 Five Victoria 's Secret super models downstairs ?
 They took themselves off .
 So what are you saying ?
 You 're the victim here ?
 What would Sophie say if she came home and saw you sitting here ?
 She 'd say , " stop hogging the goggles . "
 Oleg , let me just say this :
 Vermont is closer than you think .
 I don 't know where this argument is going , but I 'm going to that damn supermodel party .
 Oleg , it 's late , I 'm gonna lay this on the line for you .
 You 're no George Clooney .
 You 're not even George Costanza .
 These sheets are amazing and you are never gonna do better than Sophie .
 She is hot and clearly has no sense of smell .
 I love Sophie .
 I 'll go home .
 On second thought , I don 't trust myself to walk by your apartment .
 Better lock me in here .
 ( Lily ) Caroline !
 Max !
 Come down here !
 Hurry !
 I knew it !
 See , Max ?
 They 're begging us to come .
 I 'm back again .
 Are you coming ?
 Oh , let me think .
 Downstairs with an open bar or up here , alone , with Oleg in his tighty- not- that- whities ?
 Should we tie you up ?
 No , it 'll just make me hornier .
 I knew they wanted us to come to the party !
 How could they not ?
 Last night I taught Petra how to eat bread without tearing it into little pieces first .
 Don 't try it . I was a navy seal .

 You think you 're tough ?
 I lived in a refrigerator box for a month .
 With no top .
 Not the box . Me .
 ( Lily ) Max , Caroline , get in here !
 See we were invited . ' cause we 're " A " list .
 Hey !
 The toilet is clogged and I need you to take care of it , please .
 " A list " as in " a " janitor list .
 I don 't know what to do .
 Can one of you call the concierge ?
 Sure .
 Caroline !
 Wait , wait , wait ... you didn 't just call us down here 'cause the toilet 's clogged , did you ?
 No .
 Okay , good .
 The kitchen sink is backed up , too .
 But , toilet , I got this .
 I was almost born in one .
 Excuse me , excuse me , excuse me , excuse me .
 All right , everyone just calm down .
 No need to overreact .
 And there 's the pool we mentioned in our ad .
 Oh , boy .
 Yup , we got some floaters .
 Caroline , I 'm gonna need the plunger and a lobotomy .
 This happens with vintage toilets .
 Part of their old- world charm .
 We got some charm stuck on your loofah .
 Hey guys , remember last night how we just bit into that bread without chewing it ?
 Good times .
 I need that damn plunger , I don 't want to die this way .
 Got it , but it 's caught on something .
 [ grunts ]
 [ screaming ]
 What kind of a dump is this ?
 Hey ! You wanted the Williamsburg Experience , this is it !


 Good news , Martha . I have your flat iron

 looking pretty much back to normal .
 Oh , that 's good . Keep it .
 Again , sorry about your cashmere sweaters in here .
 But when we ran out of paper towels ,
 You did scream , " just use anything , make it stop . "
 And of course , we 'll pay to have them all dry cleaned .
 Oh , that 's nice . Keep them .

 Okay , we can leave .
 I am off the phone with my therapist .
 And it goes without saying , we won 't charge you guys for this weekend .
 No way . Here .
 You are taking this check and my therapist 's phone number .
 I do not know how you are standing up without him .
 What ? Come on , this is nothing .
 One month , the floor actually opened up and swallowed us .
 Yeah , we 've been through worse .
 Oh , it 's really cool the way you two support each other .
 Yup , we 're a pair of support hose .
 And speaking of support ...
 Here , Max .
 No way !
 Look , Caroline , it 's a bra- nanza !
 And , Caroline , since you don 't really need to wear a bra ...
 This apartment may be hell , but you are a real angel .
 Here .
 Aw , my own wings ?
 Thank you , guys .
 Hey , can I ask you something ?
 As long as it doesn 't have anything to do with rats .
 How come you didn 't invite us to the party ?
 What ? I thought Martha did .

 I thought Lily did .
 ( both ) Model moment !
 Pick- up , Caroline !
 Yup , I always knew you would die here .
 Pick- up , Max !
 Looking good , Max .
 After you drop that , have Caroline come back here and lock me in the walk- in till Sophie gets home .
 Max , I just realized we 're kind of the supermodels of waitressing .
 And I just realized my boobs aren 't always supposed to hit my side .
