 Hey , how 's my little astronautie hottie ?
 Okay , I guess .
 It 's just , being cooped up in this ... tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me .
 Well , hang in there .
 You just have a couple more days to go , and then you 'll be home .
 I know .
 I got to get back to work . I love you .
 Love you too .
 Hey , Bernie ?
 Before you go , can you do something for me ? What do you want me to do ?
 Okay , here it is .
 I really miss gravity .
 Can you drop something so I can watch it fall ?
 Really , you 're serious ?
 Okay .
 Oh , baby , you 're killing me .
 Ugh .
 Hey , Sheldon ? Hi . This came for you today .
 It 's from your mom .
 Oh !
 Thank you , Penny . Mm- hmm .
 Yeah , w ... here .
 For your troubles .
 Oh , boy , a whole dollar .
 Now , I can quit my paper route . So , what 's in it ?
 Mmm , doesn 't matter .
 Half the time , he just ends up playing with the box .
 Yeah , it 's journals and research papers I wrote as a child .
 Aw , how cute . Is this like a diary ?
 No , that 's my potty training journal .
 Really , your potty training journal ? Yeah .
 And forgive my crude penmanship .
 I didn 't start typing until I was six .
 " August 7 , 8 : 42 a . m . This is humiliating . What was wrong with diapers ? "
 ( giggles )
 There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape , color and consistency . Oh !
 Disgusting .
 No , what 's disgusting is he 's still keeping track .
 Why do you need all this stuff ... ? No , no , no , no ...
 Sorry !
 I am glad you asked .
 Oh !
 Yeah , are you familiar with the Higgs boson ?
 Of course , it is ... it 's been in the news .
 And it 's a very famous boson .
 Nice try .
 Now , in 1964 , Dr. Peter Higgs , accomplished self- promoter and physicist , he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson .
 Now , initially , the paper was rejected , but recently , he was proven right .
 And now he 's on the fast track to win a Nobel prize .
 Yeah , that 's basically what I said . Yeah ...
 The point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago , so that got me thinking , perhaps I 've already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize .
 I didn 't know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom- boom in the potty .
 You really think there 's some kind of scientific discovery in here ?
 Well , this box only covers my work through nursery school . There 's a good deal more to come .
 I didn 't really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time- suck known as " playing outdoors . "
 LEONARD :
 So , you 're going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff ? ( gasps ) That 's a good point .
 My time is much too valuable .
 You know , perhaps I should find someone to do it for me .
 You know , someone with a rudimentary understanding of science , but whose real talents lie in menial labor .
 Not gonna happen .
 Yeah , well , if I didn 't think you could handle it , I wouldn 't be asking .
 If you want help , just hire a grad student . Maybe I could do it .
 You , really ?
 You can assess the quality of my work ?
 Okay , um , here .
 I wrote this when I was five years old .
 " A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non- self contradictory set of abelion groups . "
 I 'm just a blonde monkey to you , aren 't I ?

 Original Air Date on October 11 , 2012 All right , Ms. Jenson .
 Uh , before we begin , may I offer you a refreshment ?
 Water , coffee , tea , a marijuana cigarette ?
 No , thanks .
 I 'm fine . Now , are you sure ?
 Everyone 's smoking them .
 I think they 're the best .
 I don 't do drugs .
 Excellent , yeah .
 That was a ruse .
 They 're not the best .
 Physics is the best .
 And by the way , coffee was also an unacceptable choice .
 All right , so I see here you 're from Des Moines , Iowa .
 Uh , you 're summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University . Oh , and two years ago , you had a persistent ear infection .

 I hope that didn 't cause any hearing loss .
 No , of course not . How did you know about that ?
 I did a comprehensive background check .
 Medical records , credit reports , criminal history .
 ( muffled ) :
 I trust you paid off those parking tickets .
 Yes , I did .
 Hearing unimpaired , good .
 Look , Dr. Cooper , I really want this position .
 It would be an incredible honor to work for a man of your brilliance .
 Flattery will not get you this job , Ms. Jenson .
 It 's not flattery if it 's the truth . Oh , well , thank you .
 Welcome aboard .

 You talk to Howard lately ?
 Uh , yeah , last night .
 He kept making me drop pencils for him .
 I got uncomfortable .
 Hey , Sheldon , hope you 're hungry .
 They 're serving macaroni and ... ( voice deepens ) : cheese .

 ( mocking ) :
 Smooth .
 Hi .
 Hello . Sheldon , aren 't you going to introduce us ?
 No .
 I have people for that now . You 're up .
 I 'm Alex , Dr. Cooper 's new assistant .
 Ah , congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul .
 I 'm Leonard .
 This is Raj . It 's nice to meet you .
 I 'm so excited to be working with Dr ...
 Yeah , please reserve chitchat for your breaks , Ms. Jenson .
 Yeah , FYl , there will be no breaks .
 I should probably get to work .
 She seems nice .
 Hey , you already got a girlfriend .
 I call dibs .
 All I said was , " She seems nice . "
 Yeah , well , I love her .
 ( phone rings ) Hey , I wasn 't expecting to hear from you today .

 Everything okay ?
 Uh , no , not really .
 What 's wrong ? Well , remember the ...
 Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home ?
 Uh- huh . It 's delayed .
 We 're gonna be here at least another week .
 Maybe ten days .
 It 's the Russians , so you don 't know .
 They left dogs up here in the '60s .
 Come on , Howard .
 No one 's leaving you up there .
 I don 't know how much longer I can take this . I can 't sleep , and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux .
 ( inhales )
 I 'm down to my last three Tums .
 You 're going to be fine .
 You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom .
 And they ran out of low- fat ice cream on day two . Just calm down and take a few deep breaths .

 Okay , okay .
 ( breathing deeply )
 What am I doing ?
 I 'm using up all the oxygen .
 If I die , promise you 'll never have sex with another man .

 Oh , yeah .
 I 'm a man- eater now .
 Okay , for the final touch , this is an eyelash curler .
 You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed .
 Oh , I don 't know .
 Looks like something used by Tinker Bell 's gynecologist .
 Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook , so ...

 Who are you calling ?
 I 'm going to video- chat Sheldon . Mmm . If my new look leads to phone sex ,
 I 'm going to have to ask you to leave the room . ALEX :
 Dr. Cooper 's office .
 Oh , hello . Who are you ?
 I 'm Alex , Dr. Cooper 's assistant .
 Can I help you ?
 I 'd like to speak to Sheldon . I 'm sorry .
 He 's asked me to hold all calls unless you 're Stephen Hawking , his mother or himself from the future .
 All right .
 Well , tell him Amy called . Last name ?
 He knows my last name . I 'm his girlfriend .
 We have a contract and everything .
 I 'll send you a PDF .
 All right , I will tell him you called .

 Hmm , that 's weird .
 What ?
 Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex .
 He didn 't mention that Alex was a girl .
 Maybe he didn 't notice . You 're right .
 I don 't have to worry about Sheldon .
 ( laughing ) :
 No , you do not .
 It 's her I have to worry about .
 Oh , Amy , really ?
 She is not going to come on to Sheldon .
 Oh , really ?
 Look at this face .
 How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it ?
 Well , for starters , at some point , that face starts talking .



 Amy , this is crazy . You have nothing to be suspicious about .
 I 'm not suspicious .
 I just want to stop in , say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant .
 Aha !

 Can we go now ?
 Hang on .



 What are you doing ?
 Isn 't it obvious ?
 I 'm spreading my scent to mark my territory .
 Come on , Amy . That is not gonna work .
 Really ?
 Because just before you became my best friend ,
 I did this all over your apartment .

 Has your , uh , assistant said anything about me ?
 In fact , she has .
 Uh , her exact words were , " What is that guy 's problem ? "
 I 'm in her head .
 Let the dance begin .
 Here 's your frozen yogurt , Dr. Cooper .
 This should be fun .
 Half chocolate , half vanilla , side by side , not swirled ?
 Yes . Half a teaspoon of sprinkles ?
 Rainbow , not chocolate . Two cherries ?
 One on top , one on the bottom .
 Stems removed ?
 Um ... top one , yes . I didn 't check the one on the bottom .
 Oh ... !

 I 'm so sorry , Dr. Cooper .
 It 's all right , Alex .
 I 'm not mad at you ; I 'm just disappointed .
 Wait , Alex .
 Do you want to join us ?
 Um ...
 Uh , Alex , a moment . I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter .
 Do you think it 's appropriate for her to sit with us , given her station ?
 Given her what ?
 If I 've learned anything from British television shows on PBS , it 's that servants dine downstairs with their own kind .
 What ? It 's a kindness , Leonard .
 Otherwise , you 're cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that 's just beyond their soot- stained fingertips .
 Oh , sure . Please join us .
 Oh , okay . Thank you .
 So , Alex , what 's the topic of your dissertation ? I 'm looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth 's L- Five Lagrange point .
 Oh , that happens to be
 Dr. Koothrappali 's field of expertise .
 You two have a lot to talk about .
 Is that true ?


 Is he all right ?
 No .
 But compared to your boss , he 's the poster boy for sanity .
 It 's okay , I 've been around scientists all my life .
 My dad 's an astronomer at SETl .
 Oh , SETl -- the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence .
 You should introduce him to Sheldon .
 The search is over .
 So , what kind of research are you doing ?
 High- energy lasers .
 Ooh .
 Military ?
 Not yet , but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away .
 ( both chuckle )
 You were right . I had nothing to worry about .
 That skank 's your problem , not mine .
 You 're very funny , Dr. Hofstadter .
 LEONARD :
 Thank you .
 Aah !
 Cherry stem !
 Cherry stem !
 ( coughing , gagging ) How you doing , Howie ?
 You feeling a little better ?
 Oh , a lot better , thanks .
 One sec .
 Listen close .
 I don 't have a lot of time .
 I need you to go to my house .
 In my bedroom , you 'll find a model rocket .
 I want you to take it and bring it back to your place .
 Okay ... Step two :
 Build a version roughly 14 stories high .
 Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me . ( whispers ) : I 'll leave the door unlocked .
 Howie , honey , maybe you should talk to someone ,
 let them know you 're having a little anxiety .
 No , no , I 'm fine . No anxiety ! ( quietly ) :
 We should probably talk in code .
 From now on , " frog " is me , " sandwich " means you and " lemon " means rocket .
 So , come on , sandwich , build me a lemon 'cause froggy wants to come home !
 Look at you , putting on a brave face .
 There 's nothing to be brave about .
 Everything 's fine .
 Really ?
 I don 't know how much you know about primate behavior , but Sheldon 's assistant was clearly courting Leonard .
 Were she a mandrill , she would have bent over and displayed her brightly colored hindquarters
 like a big red welcome mat .
 By the way , you try that at the junior prom , you get kicked out .
 Okay , maybe she flirting with him , but who cares ?
 Look , I don 't even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now .
 So says your prefrontal cortex .
 But meanwhile , the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard , it must be because he 's desirable .
 Well , of course he 's desirable . I mean , he 's great .
 He 's smart , he 's sweet , and , ooh , in the bedroom , whew , let me tell you , he tries .

 So it does bother you .
 Fine , it bothers me a little . No .
 You know what ?
 This is stupid .
 It doesn 't bother me .
 Okay , it bothers me .
 But only because she wouldn 't stop laughing . Leonard is not that funny .
 And there you have it ; prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust .
 If this were a boxing match , they might call it
 " The thrilla adjacent to the amygdala . "
 ( laughs )
 If you were a brain scientist , you would be busting a gut right now !

 So , how was work today ?
 Ah , it was all right , I guess .
 Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon .
 Caught Raj right in the eye .
 Oh !
 You 're kidding . No , Raj had to go to the nurse .
 Wow .
 Anything else ?
 Mmm , the nurse is a woman , so he couldn 't talk to her .
 She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt .

 Is that it ?
 Isn 't that enough ?
 It had the weaponized fruit and a puppet .
 What more do you want ?
 Oh , good , Leonard , you 're here .
 Science news .
 This will interest you .
 And , Penny , feel free to paint your nails . What do you got ?
 I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize .
 Behold . " Magnets : What Do They Stick To ? "
 If the answer is " metal , " it 's not exactly groundbreaking .
 The original title was " A Rederivation of Maxwell 's Equations Regarding Electromagnetism "
 I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch .
 Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis .
 Oh , it 's about time .
 I hated the old way .
 Hi .
 I 'm Penny .
 Alex .
 Uh , do you work with Dr. Hofstadter ? In a way .

 We 've kind of been involved in a five- year experiment .
 Oh . Well , you 're lucky .
 He seems very talented .
 And I 'm sure a lot of people want to work with him .
 Well , a lot of people can 't .
 Uh , hey .
 Where are we going ?
 My limbic system wants to take your pants off .


 She seems nice .
 Notice people on your own time .
 We 're working .



 Hey , Howie , how you feeling ?
 Better .
 Much better .
 The other astronauts held me down , gave me a shot . Oh ...
 Attention , people of Earth :
 Tonight , there will be moons in the sky .
 Howie , stop that .
 NASA 's watching this !
 Put your pants back on !
 Whee !
 Whee !
