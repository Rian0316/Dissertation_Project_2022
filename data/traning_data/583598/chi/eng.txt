 Aunt Silv , stop yeIling ! If you 'd told me vegetarian Iasagna . . . . . . I would 've made vegetarian Iasagna .
 The meat 's only every third Iayer . Maybe you could scrape .
 Ross , did you reaIly read aII these baby books ?
 You could plunk me down in any woman 's uterus , no compass . . . . . . and I could find my way out Iike that !
 This is cool . It says in some parts of the world people eat the placenta .
 And we 're done with the yogurt .
 Sorry .
 Aunt Silv , I did this as a favor . I am not a caterer . What do you want me to do with a dozen Iasagnas ?
 Nice talk , Aunt Silv . You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth ? Ross , Iisten .
 Do you know that right now your baby is only this big ?
 This is your baby . " Hi , Daddy . "
 HeIlo .
 " How come you don 't Iive with Mommy ? "
 " How come Mommy Iives with that other Iady ? "
 " What 's a Iesbian ? "
 Honey , you can say it . It 's Poconos . Poconos .
 It 's Iike " poke a nose . "
 Poke a nose .
 So did I hear " Poconos " ?
 My sister 's giving us her place for the weekend .
 First weekend away together .
 - Yeah , it 's a big step .
 - I know . It 's just a weekend .
 Big deal .
 Wasn 't this supposed to be just a fling ? Shouldn 't it be . . . . . . flung by now ?
 We are way past the " fling " thing . I 'm feeling things I 've only read about in DanieIle SteeI books .
 When I 'm with him , I 'm just totaIly , totaIly . . . .
 Nauseous . I 'm physicaIly nauseous . What am I supposed to do ?
 CaII Immigration ?
 I could caII Immigration .
 I love babies with their Iittle baby shoes . . . . . . and their Iittle baby toes and their Iittle hands . . . .
 You 're gonna have to stop that . . . . . . forever .
 Need a new table .
 You think ?
 - Come on in .
 - HeIlo .
 I brought the books . . . . . . and Monica sends her Iove along with this Iasagna .
 Great ! Is it vegetarian ? Because Susan doesn 't eat meat .
 I 'm pretty sure that it is .
 So I got the results of the amnio today .
 TeII me . Is everything . . . ?
 TotaIly and completely healthy .
 That 's great ! That is great ! When did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis ?

 That 's our friend Tanya .
 Of course , it 's your friend Tanya .
 Don 't you wanna know about the sex ?
 The sex ? I 'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together . But when you throw in Tanya . . . .
 The sex of the baby , Ross . You know it ?

 Do you want to know ?
 I don 't want to know . Absolutely not .
 I think you shouldn 't know untiI you Iook down there . . . . . . and see , " Oh , there it is . . . " . . . or isn 't .

 - HeIlo , Ross .
 - Susan .
 So ? So did you hear ?
 Yes , we did . Everything 's A- OK .
 Oh , that 's so cool ! It reaIly is . Do we know ?
 We certainly do . It 's going to be a --
 HeIlo ? A guy who doesn 't wanna know is standing here .
 WeIl , is it what we thought it would be ?

 What . . . ? What did we think it 'd be ?

 I don 't want to know . Don 't want to know . I should probably just go .
 - WeIl , thanks for the books .
 - No problem .

 Susan .
 Who should we caII first ? Your folks or Deb and Rhona ?

 Never mind . I don 't wanna know .
 So just because it was my table , I have to buy a new one ?
 That 's the rule .
 What rule ? There 's no rule . If anything , you owe me a table .
 How did you get that ?
 This piece of furniture was fine . . . . . . untiI your breakfast adventure with Angela Delveccio . You knew about that ?

 The impressions you made in the butter Ieft Iittle to the imagination .
 How about if we split it ?
 What do you mean , Iike , buy it together ?

 Do you think we 're ready for that ?
 Why not ?
 It 's a big commitment . What if one of us wants to move out ?
 - Are you moving out ?
 - I 'm not moving out .
 You 'd teII me if you were ?
 - It 's just , with my Iast roommate -- - I know aII about Kip .
 We bought a hibachi together , then he ran off and got married . . . . . . and things got ugly .
 Let me ask you something . Was Kip a better roommate than me ? Don 't do that .

 You 've got a couple changes in your schedule . Your 4 : 00 herbaI massage has been pushed back to 4 : 30 . And Ms. Summerfield canceled her 5 : 30 shiatsu .
 Thanks .
 Here comes your 3 : 00 . I don 't mean to sound unprofessional , but -- Yum !

 Paolo ! Hi ! What are you doing here ?
 RacheIla teII me you . . . . . . massage ?
 WeIl , RacheIla 's right .
 I don 't know what you said , so Iet 's start .
 I am . . . . . . being naked ?
 That 's your decision . Some people prefer to take off -- Being naked !
 I can 't believe you don 't want to know . I couldn 't not know . If the doctor knows , and CaroI knows , and Susan knows --
 And Monica knows .
 How could you ? I don 't even know .
 CaroI caIled to thank me for the Iasagna . I asked . She told me .
 So what 's it going to be ?
 Great ! Now he knows and I don 't know .
 I 'm sorry . I 'm excited about being an aunt .
 Or an uncle .


 Fine !
 What 's the matter ?
 Nothing ! I 'm sorry . I 'm just , I 'm out of sorts .
 Can we get some cappuccino over here ?
 Oh , right !
 That 's me !
 That table place closes at 7 . Come on .
 Fine .
 What is it ?
 You know Paolo ?
 I 'm familiar with his work .
 He made a move on me .
 - The store 'II be open tomorrow .
 - More coffee .
 What happened ?
 He came in for a massage . . . ... and everything was fine until ....
 My God !
 Are you sure ?
 Oh , yeah . I 'm sure .
 And aII of a sudden , his hands weren 't the problem anymore .
 Was it . . . ?
 Boy Scouts could 've camped under there .

 " Ooh , " what ? -- ma Thurman .
 - The actress !
 - Uma Thurman !
 Thanks , Rach .
 - What 'II you do ?
 - You have to teII her . You have to ! It 's your moraI obligation as a friend . . . . . . as a woman .
 It 's a feminist issue .
 Guys ?
 Guys ?
 You have to teII her .
 Feminist issue ? That 's where I went .
 She is gonna hate me !

 WiII you pick one ? Just pick one . Here , how about that one ?
 That 's patio furniture .
 So what ? Like people wiII come in and think , " Uh- oh , I 'm outside again . "
 Fine .
 What about the birds ?
 Birds just don 't say . . . . . . " HeIlo , sit here . I don 't know . Eat something . "
 You pick one .
 How about the Iadybugs ?
 So forget about the birds , but big red insects suggest fine dining ?
 Fine ! Do you want the birds ? Get the birds !
 Not Iike that , I won 't . Kip would 've Iiked the birds .


 Hi , Pheebs .
 Are you moving out ?
 No , these aren 't aII of my suitcases . This one 's Paolo 's .
 Rachel , can we talk for a sec ?

 Sure .
 Just for a sec , because Paolo 's on his way over .

 We haven 't known each other for that Iong a time . There are three things you should know about me .
 One , my friends are the most important thing in my Iife .
 Two , I never Iie .
 And three , I make the best oatmeaI raisin cookies in the world .
 Thanks , Pheebs .
 My God ! Why have I never tasted these before ?
 I don 't make them a Iot , because it 's not fair to the other cookies .
 You 're right . These are the best oatmeaI raisin cookies .
 Which proves that I never Iie .
 I guess you don 't .
 Paolo made a pass at me .
 So what do you think ?
 It 's the most beautifuI table I 've ever seen .
 I know .
 So wiII you balance the plates on these Iittle heads ?
 Who cares ? We 'II eat at the sink . Come on !
 Heads up , Ross . Score ! You suck !
 Are you okay ?
 I need some milk .
 I 've got milk .
 Here you go .
 Better ?

 I feeI so stupid ! I think about the other day with you guys . And I was aIl , " Oh , Paolo !
 He 's so great !
 He makes me feeI so -- "
 God ! I 'm so embarrassed !
 I 'm so embarrassed . I 'm the one he hit on .
 Phoebe , I pushed him on you . If I had never met him , this would never --
 - I 'm so sorry . - No , I 'm sorry .
 Wait ! - What are we sorry about ?
 - I don 't know . Right . He 's the pig .
 - Such a pig !
 - Oh , God , he 's such a pig !
 He 's Iike a big disgusting pig . . . . - Pig man !
 - Yes , good !
 But he was my pig man ! How did I not see this ?
 Oh , I know !
 Because . . . . . . he 's gorgeous . And he 's charming . And the way he Iooks at you --

 The end .
 God !
 Should I not have told you ?
 Trust me , it 's much better that I know .
 But I just Iiked it better before . It was better .
 I think she took it pretty weIl .
 Paolo 's over there right now , so . . . .
 We should go and see if she 's okay .
 Just one second . Score ! Game !
 Us !
 Come on .
 It Iooks Iike we kicked your butts .
 She kicked our butts . You could be on the Olympic " Standing There " team .
 Come on . Two on one .
 Why are you stiII here ? She just broke up with him . It 's time for you to swoop in .
 What , now ?
 Now is when you swoop .
 When Paolo walks out of there , you gotta be the first guy she sees .
 She 's got to know you 're everything he 's not .
 You 're Iike the anti- Paolo .
 My Catholic friend is right . She 's distraught .
 You 're there for her . You pick up the pieces , and then you usher in . . . . . . " The Age of Ross . "
 Hold it ! Ascolta !
 - How 's it going ?
 - Don 't stare . She finished throwing his clothes off the balcony . Now there 's just gesturing and arm- waving .
 That is either , " How could you ? " or " Enormous breasts ! "
 Here he comes .
 I am . . . . . . to say goodbye .
 Okay , bye- bye .
 I hate you for what you did to Rachel .
 But I stiII have five of these . . . . . . so heat it at 375 untiI the cheese bubbles .


 I just wanna teII you . . . . . . and I think I 'd speak for everyone when I say . . . . Just Iook at her .

 Guys , I think only one of us should go out there . . . - . . . so she 's not overwhelmed .
 - Right .
 And I reaIly think it should be me .

 You aII right ?
 I 've been better .
 Come here .
 Listen . . . . . . you deserve so much better than him .
 I mean , you . . . . . . you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you .

 What ?
 I 'm so sick of guys ! I don 't want to Iook at another guy . I don 't want to think about another guy .
 I don 't even want to be near another guy .

 Ross , you 're so great .
 - Are you aII right ? - Are you okay ?

 Medium . Any cookies Ieft ?

 See , Rach . . . . . . I don 't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer .
 What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process .
 I just need to be by myself for a while . I just gotta figure out what I want .
 See , because not aII guys out there are gonna be a Paolo .
 No , I know . I know . And I 'm sure your Iittle boy 's not gonna grow up to be one .
 What ? What ?
 I 'm having a boy ?
 No . In fact , you 're not having a boy .
 I 'm having a boy . Am I having a boy ?
 You 're having a boy !
 I 'm having a boy ! I 'm having a boy !
 - What ? - What is it ?
 I 'm having a boy !

 We already knew that !
 I 'm having a son .
 And that would be a shutdown !
 Shutout !
 Where you guys going ? Come on , one more game !
 It 's 2 : 30 in the morning .
 Get out !
 You guys are always hanging out in my apartment .
 Come on , I 'II only use my Ieft hand . Come on , wussies !
 AII right ! Okay ! I gotta go !
 I 'm going .
 And I 'm gone .
 One more game ?
