 00 : 00 : 02, 436 -- > 00 : 00 : 05, 671 Leonard , what time does your mom 's plane get in ?
 I don 't know -- some time tomorrow morning .
 Don 't you want to know for sure ?
 No need to .
 As soon as she flies into California airspace ,
 I 'll feel a disturbance in the Force .
 It 's so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award .
 Well , my mother 's been there for every honor I 've won since I beat out my twin sister for the " did it on the potty " trophy .

 How does this look ?
 Aw , it 's so nice .
 She 's gonna love it .
 Sure , his mom gets roses .
 When I want them , they 're a " bouquet of severed plant genitals . "
 You act like I didn 't get you that mushroom log on Valentine 's Day .
 He 's right .
 Roses die , but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years .
 You know , your mom 's never been too thrilled with our relationship .
 Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me .
 If you could run out and get a PhD , that might make her like you .
 Really ? It didn 't work for you .

 Do you think the moms will get along ?
 Uh , I don 't know .
 They 're pretty different .
 Maybe they 'll be best friends . One of them is brilliant , one is sweet and simple .

 Shelly , I 'm so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award . Oh , thank you , Mother .
 I tried to read your paper , but it was very hard for me to understand .
 Oh , it 's quite straightforward , actually .
 It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n- dimensional superfluid .
 Interesting .
 You can believe that , but God filling an ark with animals two- by- two is nonsense .
 What did they feed the lions , Mother ?
 The floating bodies of drowned sinners , of course .
 Listen , Leonard 's mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science .
 Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she 's here ?
 Are you ashamed of me ?
 Of course not .
 I love you .
 I 'm just embarrassed by the things you believe , do and say .
 Well , I love you , too . My little bowl of lion chow .

 So , have you and Penny set a wedding date ?
 No , we 're kind of taking it slow .
 I see .

 What does that mean ?
 You 've been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year .
 One has to wonder if there 's a problem .
 Are you having satisfactory intercourse ?
 Yes , Mother .

 Only satisfactory . I see .

 I change my answer . It- it 's amazing . It 's hot .
 We can barely keep our hands off each other .
 Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess .
 But then , you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex .
 See , this right here , what you 're doing , can you please not do that around Sheldon 's mom ?
 Why ?
 Are you attracted to her , too ?
 Of course not .
 She 's- she 's just a very sweet and God- fearing lady , and you have to be respectful of her beliefs .
 Leonard , I 'm an adult .
 I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life .
 Thank you . Where is she from again ?
 East Texas .
 Ugh .

 Hey , look who 's here .
 Oh , Dr. Hofstadter , it 's so good to see you again .
 Likewise .
 I read your paper ; it was very impressive .
 Oh , thank you .
 We just spent two hours in traffic .
 Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper ?
 Of course I did , but it 's a mother 's job to make sure her child 's self- esteem is not dependent on anyone 's approval .

 That 's so sweet , you think I have self- esteem .
 Dr. Hofstadter , I want you to meet my mother , Mary .
 So nice to meet you .
 Nice to meet you , too . How was your flight ?
 Very pleasant .
 And yours ?
 Lovely .
 Almost as if someone -- not saying who -- was watching over the plane .



 You 're kidding , right ?
 Subtle , Mom , real subtle .
 Stuart .
 Morning .
 We talked about this . I don 't mind you still living here , but we got to have some rules .
 And rule number one is pants .

 Hey , hey .
 ( clears throat )
 You must be very proud of your son . Oh , yes .
 He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court .
 He did ?
 Oh , you mean this son .
 Uh , sure , he 's terrific .
 Uh , Beverly , would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis ?
 Uh , you mean , hypothesis .
 I hypothesized it all by myself .
 Calm down , dear .
 Mary , I 'm curious .
 When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind ?
 Ooh , good question .
 Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper , boy genius .
 Well , I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed .
 Ooh , this is a good one .
 Now , the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy , he was always concerned with the well- being of others .

 And he didn 't think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity , so he was gonna power the entire town for free .
 ( stammers ) Tell her about the uranium !
 Tell her about the uranium .
 Oh , well !
 Oh , this is adorable .
 When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad ,
 I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends .
 Yeah .
 But I wasn 't .
 'Cause I didn 't have any friends .
 ( laughs ) : No .
 It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad !

 Sounds like Sheldon was a handful . Oh , he was a handful .
 I was a handful .
 You still are .

 Uh , Mom , hey , tell Mary the story about how I made a Van de Graaff generator out of our vacuum cleaner .

 All right .
 He broke the vacuum cleaner .

 ( video game sound effects playing )
 I mean , for a while , everything was vampires . Now it 's all zombies .
 I wonder what the next monster fad will be .
 We haven 't had a good invisible man in a while .
 Clearly , you 've never seen me try to talk to a woman .
 Guys .
 In the time you 've been sitting here playing video games ,
 I got the car washed , picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank .
 I put on pants .
 Kiss- ass .

 Okay , I don 't know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers , but it stops today .
 You guys are cleaning the kitchen , top to bottom .
 Hey , I don 't even live here .
 Yes or no , do you have clothes in my laundry right now ?
 I do .
 And some of it 's wool , so dry flat if possible .

 Oh , and here 's a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree .
 You don 't look very happy .
 Well , I had just begun puberty .
 ( sighs )
 It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life .
 Shelly does not like change .
 Oh , true .
 But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen .
 Hey , sorry , got caught up at work .
 Hi , Beverly !
 Hello . ( giggles )
 Oh , okay .
 ( chuckles )
 Sorry , I forgot .
 You remember my mother .
 Oh , yes . Hi , Mary !
 Good to see you again , dear .
 Ah , yeah , now that 's what I 'm talking about .
 So , Mom , you haven 't seen Penny since we got engaged .
 Oh , yeah , let me show you the ring . Oh , lovely .
 Must have been very expensive .
 Oh , no , not at all .
 No , we , uh , found a place online that , uh , repurposes diamond drill bits .
 We did not .
 That 's not true .
 Can I speak to you alone for a second ?
 Oh , sure .
 It came from Tiffany 's .
 ( chuckles ) You mean the box , right ?
 Keep walking !


 Really doesn 't matter to me how much he spent on the ring . I think .
 Did I misspeak about the ring ?
 Yes , and we 'll get back to that .
 But , uh , even with your mother here , you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom .
 You 're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers !
 Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as " super weaning " ?
 Yes , you are a super weaner !

 Well , now I have to correct you .
 A- As a bit of an elephant seal buff , the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup .
 So I believe the term you 're looking for is a double mother suckler .
 Yeah , you 're right . That is the term I 'm looking for .
 You are a dirty double mother suckler !

 Okay , well , now that we have the terminology straightened out . How dare you !


 We 're not in a rush . We 'll set a date when the time is right .
 It doesn 't matter , sweetie .
 The moment a man lays with a woman , they are married in the eyes of the Lord .
 Uch .

 " Uch " ?
 The bible is " uch " to you ?
 No , I 'm sorry .
 That was inappropriate .
 As a psychiatrist , I know how important people 's superstitions can be to them .


 You want to talk about superstitions ?
 Sheldon sent me the books you wrote -- all that nonsense about superegos and ids .
 What bull dropped that on the barn floor ?
 His name is Sigmund Freud .
 Hey , look at that ! You both believe in Jewish bearded guys .

 Stay out of this .
 Mm- hmm .
 At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion .
 All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama .

 It 's fascinating .
 How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you ?
 I know the answer . You 're not gonna like it .
 Try me .
 When I was pregnant with Shelly , I was driving to church , and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb- ass daddy .

 And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes .

 What is that supposed to mean ?
 It means ...
 I can 't believe we 're having this conversation .
 Well , do it some more .
 Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself .
 Why don 't we all stops hitting ourselves and talk about something safe , you know ,
 like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are .
 It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you ! Oh , don 't flatter yourself !
 She likes everybody better than she likes me !



 How old is this Jell- O ?
 Well , it 's carrots , so gonna say very .
 Sorry we have to do this .
 Bernadette 's not wrong .
 She does work hard around here .
 Yeah , maybe it 's a good thing if she stops babying you so much .
 She doesn 't baby me .
 I saw her pull you home in a wagon .
 For your information ,
 I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck .
 Face it , dude , Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to , and that was not a healthy relationship .
 You 're right . ( chuckles )
 It 's time for me to act like an adult in this marriage .
 Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash .

 Bernie , I made a mess !

 I 'm terribly sorry that I upset your mother .
 Oh , it 's all right . She 'll forgive you . She has to or she goes to hell .


 I can 't help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies .
 Well , you doled out affection as a reward for achievement -- a proven way to raise a child .
 Or train a rat . But look how well you turned out .
 I 'd feign modesty at this point , but who would believe me ?
 Still , you need to consider how successful Leonard 's brother and sister are .
 I suppose .
 While my brother and sister are mouth- breathing idiots .
 Do you suppose you would 've flourished more in a reward- based environment ?
 Perhaps .
 But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped- up hot dogs whenever I wanted , so who cares ?
 Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself ; I always had to earn it .
 Oh , Leonard ,
 I 'm sure she loves you very much .
 In her own cold godless way .
 Yeah , and you certainly don 't have to earn my love .
 Thank you .
 Of course , you already knew that when you bought me this princess- cut drill bit .
 That 's not what it is . I know , I know .
 ( imitates drill buzzing )
 When your mom gets back , I 'm gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her .
 Well , come on now , she did kind of start it . Doesn 't matter ; a good Christian would 've turned the other cheek .
 On the other hand , a good Texan would 've shot her , so ...

 I just kind of split the difference .
 Hey , who 's in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs ? Oh , me !
 Yeah , me , too !
 Coming up .
 I don 't really feel I deserve it .

 That was a big sticky mess , but ...
 I think I got it . Looks good . Yeah .
 Look at that .
 You cleaned it up all by yourself .
 Yes , I cleaned it up all by myself .
 Honestly , I don 't know why you complain so ... Okay , maybe I missed one spot .



 Just leave .
 I 'm so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet .
 Me , too . And I respect your right to your beliefs .
 And I will pray for you .

 Okay , Mom , let 's get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else .
 BEVERLY :
 One moment .
 There 's something I need to say to you .
 Oh , really ?
 That 's too bad .
 Leonard , I always made you earn my affection , but today I realize that there 's more than one way to raise a child .
 I taught her that !
 Therefore , I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I ... shower you with unconditional love . BEVERLY :


 Wow .
 When does that start ? So needy .



 Come to Mommy .
 It 's okay , go ahead .

 Oh , my son .
 Oh , my mother .
 Oh , my God .
