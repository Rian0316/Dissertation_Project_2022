 00 : 00 : 45, 640 -- > 00 : 00 : 46, 680 Oh .
 I say , this is ...
 Thought you 'd like it .
 Like it ? It 's magnificent .
 This means a lot , Siegfried .
 Thank you . Not at all .
 Not at all .
 Happy birthday .
 Yes , Happy birthday , Triss .
 Right , more tea .
 Oh , I 've ... .. one more present for you .
 You 're giving me my own list ?
 I have decided it 's time to let you stand on your own two feet .
 Oh . Right .
 So I 'll be going out on my own ?
 Well , to all intents and purposes . I thought James could come along , just in case .
 But it 'll be your show .
 That is if you think you can handle it ?
 Oh , yes , yes , absolutely .
 Excellent .
 Hang on does that say " Sebright Saunders " ?
 Are you sending me to the estate ? Uh- huh .
 They 've a number of horses need tooth filing .
 They 're valuable animals too , so make sure you 've got your wits about you .
 Of course .
 That bag won 't be much use to you empty .
 Right .
 Make sure you take a decent rasp .
 Will do .
 And a spare . Tristan ?
 Did you hear me ?
 Tristan ? !
 Good evening with Helen , were it ?
 It was , thanks .
 She 's a smashing lass .
 Have you had the chance to talk over Glasgow with her ?
 Not yet .
 I know . I 'll do it today .
 Candy 's in foal so I said I 'd go up and take a look .
 I 'll tell her about the job , then .
 Jacket .
 Are you sure you 've got tweezers ?
 Yes . Both sizes ? Yes , and yes .
 I actually do know what I 'm doing .
 Stop your fussing . You 'll make him nervous .
 Here ...
 Very smart .
 Every inch the professional .
 Yes , well , come on , don 't be keeping them waiting .
 So will Mrs Brompton be joining us at the Drovers for birthday drinks ?
 I think she 's planning to drop in briefly .
 Hope you told her to come before things get too rowdy .
 Oh , it 's just a few drinks .
 Please try not to get completely legless .
 I can assure you , I 'm planning a very civilised evening .
 Oh , yes ? It 's not like I 'm a student any more .
 Things have changed .
 In fact , I was half wondering if a little dinner might be more appropriate .
 I mean , it wouldn 't have to be anything fancy , but if it 's too much trouble .
 Oh , aye ?
 Birthday dinner for six at less than a day 's notice ?
 No , no , you 're right , it 's a stupid idea ...
 I 'm sure I can rustle something up .
 Oh , Mrs H , you 're an absolute star .
 That 's one word for it .
 And actually , if you could make it dinner for seven ...
 Oh , for the love of God ... I just thought I might want to invite a guest .
 And who exactly might you want to invite ?
 I don 't know yet , but the day is still young .
 Good luck , Tristan .
 He doesn 't need luck . He just needs to concentrate .
 ENGlNE WHlNES
 ENGlNE GRlNDS
 Right , cheerio .
 He 'll be fine . ' Course he will .
 Right , so , when we get to the estate , I 'll just introduce myself and explain that I 'll be dealing with the horses today .
 I 'm fairly sure they 'll know who you are , Triss .
 You 've been coming out to the farms half your life .
 Yes , as Siegfried 's little brother , maybe .
 But now I 'm here as a vet . It 's a whole different kettle of fish .
 You 're going to do fine .
 You know what he 's doing , don 't you ? He 's basically setting me up to fail .
 I don 't think that 's true .
 He 's giving me this big new chance .
 But he 's just waiting for me to mess it up .



 Where 's Farnon ?
 Right here .
 You what ?
 Tristan Farnon , Mr Monkham .
 Siegfried 's brother . And fully qualified vet .
 I 'll be taking care of the tooth rasping today .
 Mr Farnon always sees to the horses himself .
 Well , he 's asked me to deputise on this occasion .
 Aye . What you gonna be doing ?
 I 'm just here to observe .
 Right , well , I can 't say as I like it . But I haven 't got all day .
 So , let 's see what you 've got .
 This way .
 Right ...
 You wanted this ? Please .
 Poor Bonnie here had quite a sizeable lipoma on her ribcage .
 Oh .
 Benign , but , still , an ugly great mass .
 Luckily , I was able to remove it with remarkable ease .
 Let 's just , erm , lay her down on that blanket , while she comes round .
 Might take an hour or so .
 That 's the ticket .
 There we are .
 Yes . Very nice , though I say so myself , it should hardly leave a scar .
 DOG YELPS
 Should she be doing that ?
 Oh , it 's nothing to worry about , happens to some animals after an anaesthetic .
 It 's just the barbiturates leaving the system .
 Well , I 'm off to the butcher 's .
 If I can get a decent enough joint ,
 I might try my hand at a beef Wellington .
 Goodness , that 's rather elaborate .
 Well , I don 't want your young ladies thinking we don 't know how to entertain .
 I assume Mrs Brompton 's still joining us ?
 Yes , yes , she was delighted with the invitation .
 Well , in 't that nice .
 Right , well , as I 'm done , I think I 'll head out too .
 And see how Triss is getting on .
 You said he needs to stand on his own two feet .
 So let him .
 Just don 't let him rattle you .
 Absolutely . Just focus on the job in hand .
 HORSES NElGH LOUDLY
 Who 's that ?
 Oh , yes .
 Miss Margot Sebright Saunders .
 Might she be a suitable candidate ?
 Rather out of my league , I fear .
 Margot 's generally squired by minor gentry .
 You 're a man of means now .
 A respectable professional .
 She might see you in a whole new light .
 See ?
 You don 't want to miss out for a lack of confidence .
 Ah , you may have a point .
 Nothing ventured .
 It certainly worked for you and Helen .
 Well , it 's early days .
 I still have time to mess it up .
 Are you two coming ?
 Excellent .
 There 's another two need doing , across the yard .
 Right , let 's take a look , shall we ?
 Hope he 's not a kicker .
 Right , here we go , good lad .
 Ah yes , I can see there 's quite a sharp point just here .
 Should be able to file that off nicely .
 If you could just hold him steady ?
 Monkham ? Yes , Miss Margot .
 I want to ride out to Sennor Woods this afternoon .
 Will you see that my horse is ready ?
 Yes , Miss . Gosh . Are you an actual vet now , Tristan ?
 That 's right . Tristan Sebastian Farnon , MRCVS , at your service .
 Well , well done you .
 Yes , I 've got all the credentials . And the qualifications and the ...
 Wonderful .
 I 'm just going up to the house , but I 'll be back for him after lunch .
 Yes , Miss .
 Aye , I 'll let you get on , then . Jolly good .
 You 're doing grand .
 HORSE NElGHS LOUDLY Easy , boy .
 Good Lord , what 's going on out there ?
 That 'll be Satan .
 Oh , yes ?
 Aye . He 's another that needs raspin ' .
 DOG WHlMPERS
 " Oh , what can ail thee , dog- at- arms ,
 " Alone and palely loitering ? "
 There 's nothing physical that I can see .
 Just don 't like being by yourself , is that it ?
 Perhaps you could play with Jess . Are you sure she 's not sickening for something ?
 Not in the least , she 's perfectly healthy .
 Probably just wants a bit of company .
 And where are you off to ? Oh , I found a spare rasp for Tristan .
 He 'll be almost done , won 't he ?
 Still , better safe than sorry .
 DOG WHlMPERS
 If you 'd rather I ...
 No , of course not .
 In for a penny .
 Right . Let 's take a look at your teeth , then , shall we ?
 HORSE NElGHS LOUDLY
 That 's it , that 's it , old fella .
 Come on . Nothing to worry about , that 's it .
 I am just going to ...
 Ah !
 Are you all right , Triss ?
 Did he get you ?
 It 's fine .
 He barely made contact .
 You sure ?
 Uh- huh .
 He nearly broke my kneecap .
 Seriously , Jim . I thought I was going to pass out at one point .
 You should have let me take over .
 Oh , Siegfried would love that .
 " A man doesn 't stop work because of a bruise ,
 " cuts and scrapes come with the territory .
 " A good vet never puts his own comfort before that of the animal . "
 Caught you a good 'un , did he ?
 Er , yes , yes . It seems he did .
 Aye .
 Evil bugger .
 HE CHUCKLES
 Well , he seems positively delighted by the whole thing .
 They like to feel they 're getting their money 's worth .
 What ? So , the more pain and suffering , the better ?
 That 's Dales folk for you .
 They 're a sadistic bunch .
 Oh , I say , Mrs H , smells marvellous .
 It really does . Yes , well , it 's just bread and cheese for now .
 So hands off .
 You really didn 't need to do all of this .
 Your birthday only comes round once a year .
 Just eat up and then you can get out from under me feet .
 Siegfried not around ?
 Erm , no . He , err , he went out .

 Out where ?
 I think he , err , was hoping to catch up with you .
 Something about a spare rasp .
 Seriously ? So he said .
 Unbelievable .
 He went to check up on me , didn 't he ?
 DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES My apologies , Mrs Hall .
 You 're all right . Lunch is cold , anyway .
 Jolly good .
 I heard we missed you at the estate ?
 What ? Oh , yes . No matter .
 I just had a quick chat with Monkham .
 So , what did Mr Monkham have to say , then ?
 Not a great deal .
 He did say you should learn to move a bit quicker .
 You do have to watch yourself with those stallions .
 Yes .
 I know .
 Nothing else ?
 Should there have been ?
 No , no , not at all .
 PHONE RlNGS
 I 'll get it .
 You know , I 've been giving some thought to those suggestions you made about the improvements .
 Oh , yes ?
 We should sit down and start making some plans together .
 That 'd be great . Thank you , Siegfried .
 All down to money , of course .
 But I think it 's time .
 That was Dobson , his heifer 's in labour but it 's not progressing .
 I said we 'd head over to lend a hand .
 Right , oh .
 James , weren 't you going to check on the Alderson 's mare ?
 I was but it 's nothing that can 't wait . I can run by tomorrow . No , no .
 You should go this afternoon . We mustn 't let the Aldersons down .
 Tristan can manage at Dobson 's .
 Can 't you ?
 Yes , yes , shouldn 't be a problem .
 That 's settled , then .
 Except , how will I get there ?
 You 'll have to take the Rover .
 Oh , I , I think I 'd probably be better in the Vauxhall .
 James will need the Vauxhall .
 But still , the Rover 's your pride and joy .
 I can easily walk over to see Hardwick 's ewe .
 Besides , it 'll go with the new bag .
 Now , just mind the steering on the bends .
 Shut up .
 I 'm sure you can handle it .
 Right .
 See you later .
 James , when you 're done at the Alderson 's , perhaps you could call by and see how Triss is getting on ?
 HORN BEEPS
 Wrong way .
 That might not be a bad idea .
 Oh , and ... .. I hope it goes well with Helen .
 HORSE NElGHS
 Oh , hello again .
 Hello . Just on my way to my next call .
 Thought I 'd stop and see how he 's getting on .
 All right , there , boy ?
 NElGHS LOUDLY You know , I took extra special care with his teeth .
 Thanks .
 Is that your car ?
 Isn 't she a beauty ?
 It 's very smart .
 Well , I 'd best not keep this one waiting ...
 It 's my birthday today .
 Is it really ? Well , many happy returns .
 Yes , well , I mean , I don 't make a big thing of them as a rule , but I am actually having a small party , well , more of a dinner , a dinner party .
 Just a few close friends , erm ,
 Helen Alderson will be there , if you happen to be free .
 Oh , I haven 't seen Helen in an absolute age .
 I 'm sure she 'd be thrilled to see you .
 So what d 'you say ?
 All right , then .
 I 'll see you this evening .
 7 : 30 , or 8 : 00 , or just , you know , come whenever .
 See you !
 GEESE CRY
 Mr Dobson , I got here as fast as I could .
 Oh , aye ? You did the right thing calling .
 Has there been any progress ? Well , no .
 Not so 's you 'd notice .
 Then I shall begin with a thorough examination .
 I 'm afraid these things aren 't always as simple as they appear .
 I 'll lead the way , shall I ?
 Very good .
 Nice and steady .
 I 'll just check her ...
 Such efficiency . We aim to please .
 RlCHARD CLEARS THROAT Right .
 She 's all right , then ?
 Well , she 's a way to go , but , yes , mother and foal are both coming along very nicely .

 Heart- rate and .... .. temperature , all fine .
 In a few months ' time , you 'll have your very own pony .
 Lucky girl .
 Candy were our mam 's . Yeah , sort of like the next generation .
 I see .
 Besides , it 's just practical .
 It takes forever to walk up to the top field .
 ' Course , if you 'd let me drive the tractor ...
 Yeah , well , maybe 's when your feet reach the pedal 's , you can .
 Dad , I 've been tall enough for months and you know it .
 Aye , annoying enough , you 're right ...
 I 'm practically an adult , you know ...
 She will be soon , much as I hate to admit it .
 Come on , then .
 Thanks for coming up .
 Not at all .
 Do I need to bring anything this evening ?
 I don 't think so , Mrs Hall has it all in hand .
 I didn 't have Triss down as the dinner- party sort .
 Ah , well , this is a whole new Tristan we 're talking about .
 Speaking of which ... I should get going .
 I said I 'd check in on him .
 How 's he getting on ?
 Surprisingly well .
 Good for him .
 It 's good news for the rest of us , too .
 Now he 's out on calls , we can split the night shifts .
 Up in , erm , Glasgow , I only had to be on call once a week .
 I thought you liked being out in the Dales under the moonlight ?
 Oh , I do .
 It 's just , I quite like a full night 's sleep , too .
 It 's a good job you didn 't stay in Glasgow any longer , then , sounds like you 'd have gone soft .
 Yeah .
 You 're probably right .
 How you doing there , Tris ?
 Thought I 'd see if you needed a hand .
 Mr Dobson .
 I 'm managing as best I can at the moment .
 Although , the presentation does ... .. present some serious difficulties .
 Both legs are back .
 It 's got an incredibly long pelvis .
 It is long .
 Oh , God , here comes another !
 COW MOANS
 Erm , everything all right there , Tris ?
 I just need a moment .
 DOG WHlNES
 WHlNING STOPS
 Thank the Lord .
 DOG WAlLS For the love of ...

 What 's wrong with you , you daft ha 'p' orth ?
 Eh ?
 Hmm ?
 Oh , come on .
 Not nice , always being on your own , is it ?
 Mmm ? Come on .
 But you so much as sniff at my beef Wellington , you 'll be out in the shed .
 Tris , do you want me to ... ?
 You poor lad .
 What can I do ?
 Could you manage a sip of tea ?
 Yes .
 Seriously , you need to let me take over .
 I 've come too far to stop now , James .
 Can 't be much longer .
 You brave lad .
 You 've earned something much stronger than a tea after this .
 Yes !
 Oh , God .
 Here we go again .
 COW AND TRlSTAN GROAN
 Evening , Mrs Hall .
 Oh , don 't worry , I 'm early . I thought you might need a hand .
 Oh , you are good .
 Well , those napkins need going on the table .
 But take your coat off first .
 And will you call me Aud ?
 You 've known me long enough .
 I can 't believe what you 've pulled off here , Aud .
 If it were me , I 'd have told Tris he could have a cold buffet and count himself lucky .
 Oh , the cooking 's no trouble . It 's all the other madness .
 Siegfried up to his usual tricks , is he ?
 He 's being ... very nice .
 Oh . Even let Tristan drive the Rover .
 That 's not like him .
 Well , no . I think Tristan 's finding it quite unnerving .
 To be honest , we all are .
 James says Tris is doing well , though .
 So far , so good .
 He reckons it 'll mean you can make some changes around here .
 Seems so . I think he got used to the easy life in Glasgow .
 To be honest , I 'm half surprised ever came back .
 I think his mother was certainly keen for him to accept the permanent position .
 Did they offer him one ?
 Apparently .
 I don 't know all the details .
 Right .
 He didn 't say anything . Did he not ?
 Now , I think we 're just about ready .
 Though , with that blessed Labrador howling nonstop earlier ,
 I 'm just hoping I haven 't put peas in the blancmange .
 Good feeling , isn 't it ?
 It really is .
 First calf .
 And I didn 't mess it up .
 Thanks again , Mr Farnon .
 You take care now . Will do .
 HE STRAlNS Good evening , Mr Dobson .
 You 're sure you 'll be all right , driving with that shoulder ?
 We can easily leave the Rover and we could ...
 You bugger !
 You were putting that on ?
 You 've got to admit , it was an inspired performance .
 I 'll tell you something ,
 Siegfried is going to get a glowing report from Mr Dobson .
 Yeah , I suppose .
 Siegfried really is proud of you , you know .
 No , he 's not .
 But maybe after today , he might stop thinking I 'm a hopeless case .
 Helen , you 're here !
 Oh , happy birthday , Tris .
 James .
 Hello , there .
 Have you seen Siegfried ?
 He said something about a telephone call from Mr Dobson .
 Right .
 I 'd better go change .
 Everything OK ?
 Mmm- hmm .
 I should take these through .
 No , that 's very helpful , Mr Dobson .
 Thank you . Yes , and you .
 Siegfried .
 Everything all right ? Shouldn 't I be asking you that ?
 Right , yes .
 All good . One calf delivered safe and sound .
 As one would hope .
 DOORBELL Well , go on , then , get yourself dressed , you 've guests arriving .
 I just thought you might want to ...
 I 'll get it , shall I ?
 Yes . No , I should .
 Mrs Brompton , hello .
 Thank you .
 I do hope I 'm not too early .
 Not at all , you 're right on time .
 Diana .
 Siegfried .
 My , how dashing you look . Thank you .
 A spot of blue ruin , for when you boys huddle up with your port .
 No need for me and Mrs Hall to miss out . Don 't you agree ?
 Very kind of you , I 'm sure .
 Come in .
 DOORBELL So , where 's the birthday boy ?
 I hope , changing into less- odoriferous attire .
 Oh , Siegfried , you are dreadful .
 Good evening .
 Margot Sebright Saunders .
 Tristan did say to come at 7 : 30 ?
 Yes , of course .
 Please , do come in . Thank you .
 So lovely to finally meet you , Mrs Farnon .
 These are for you . No , I 'm not ...
 Siegfried , honestly .
 Is something you haven 't told me ?
 I 'm Mrs Hall , the housekeeper .
 Oh , I 'm so sorry .
 Erm , should I ... ?
 I 'll just put these in water .
 Margot , do come in .
 Now , then , ladies , if this amontillado is too dry for you ,
 I do have something sweeter .
 Oh , I think we 're sweet enough already , don 't you , Margot ?
 Oh , yes , absolutely !
 Helen , I believe you know Ms Sebright Saunders ?
 Helen ! So lovely to see you .
 Margot , how are you ? Oh , I 'm perfectly fine .
 But how are you ?
 I was simply devastated about you and Hugh .
 We all were .
 Oh , that 's very kind of you .
 I 'm so glad to see you out and about , despite everything .
 Right , here we are .
 Thank you .
 What 's all that about ?
 Hmm ?
 Oh , Margot was an old pal of Hugh 's .
 Family friends or what have you .
 You didn 't think to mention that before ?
 Has he said anything to you ?
 Who ? Siegfried .
 I know he 's spoken to Dobson on the phone .
 If he thinks I 've botched it somehow , why doesn 't he just say something ?
 If you 'd all like to come through , dinner is served .
 So , Margot , how 's that May mare of your father 's ?
 Will he be entering her on the northwest circuit ?
 I should think so .
 She 's showing excellent form .
 I look forward to seeing her in action .
 Well , she 'll be up against the Hulton 's new gelding .
 He 's having a pretty good season .
 Just a shame Hugh 's missing all the events .
 Who 's this ?
 Erm , Hugh Hulton .
 Oh . I keep telling him , should just come back from France .
 I 'm sure he 's having a fine old time .
 I doubt it . He said he felt too ashamed to show his face in Darrowby .
 Though what he 's got to be ashamed of , I really don 't know .
 Hugh has nothing to be ashamed of .
 But I had to be honest with him .
 The longer I let it go on , the worse it would have got for both of us .
 I agree . Far better to make a clean break .
 No point in prolonging the agony .
 I suppose not .
 You know , Mrs Hall , this soup is absolutely first- rate .
 ALL AGREE Best one yet , Mrs H. Oh , it were no bother at all .
 No , that 's going in the pantry ...
 GENERAL CHATTER
 Especially for you , Tris .
 Oh , good choice , James .
 GLASS CHlMES
 If I might have your attention for a moment , ladies and gentlemen .
 First of all , Mrs Hall , thank you for making such a delicious meal , beef of which Wellington would be proud .
 Hear , hear . Hear , hear .
 Now , as some of you know , today was not only my brother 's birthday , it was also his first day out on call as lead vet .
 Goodness !
 How exciting .
 Now , to say that I had my reservations ...
 Would be putting it mildly .
 And I admit I thought it prudent to keep a close eye on his progress throughout the day .
 Having said all that , to my surprise , and , dare I say it , delight , the reports of his work have been uniformly excellent .



 So , a toast .
 To Tristan .
 Many happy returns and my heartfelt congratulations .
 ALL : To Tristan .
 Well done .
 That was lovely .
 You sound almost like a proud father .
 Yes , well , I suppose in a way , that 's how I feel .
 DOG WHlNES Oh , no . Good heavens , what 's that ?
 Oh , it 's fine , she 'll calm down in a minute .
 It sounds like something 's in pain .
 I almost wonder if it might be a post- operative complication .
 It 's not a complication , she just doesn 't like being on her own .
 I 'll let her out as soon as we 've finished . I 'd be more than happy to take a look .
 I 've already examined her thoroughly , thank you .
 You know , the thing I 've realised today is , it doesn 't matter how good a vet you are , people only respect you once they see you putting in the hard graft .
 Well , no- one could fault you there , Tris .
 No . Because , at the end of the day , I 'm not afraid to go the extra mile , if that 's what it takes .
 You certainly went all out . If it 's sweat and tears they want , I 'll give it to them .

 If you 've done anything to embarrass this practice , Tristan ...
 No , no , not at all .
 I may have exaggerated the effort involved a little .
 No , really ?
 A few well- placed groans , some unnecessarily straining sinews and a final howl of pain .
 Goodness !
 A final what ?
 Ah , I may have got slightly carried away but it had the desired effect .
 What is wrong with you ?
 For God 's sake , after that fiasco with the chickens ?
 I thought you 'd finally come to your senses .
 And I have , absolutely ...
 I thought you 'd finally started to take responsibly for your actions .
 Complete responsibility , totally .
 But fair 's fair , old chap , you 're hardly averse to putting on a show yourself .
 I would never resort to playacting and tomfoolery .
 Oh , come off it . You and your purple powder ?
 Blinding the great unwashed with the magic of science .
 That is entirely different . I don 't see how .
 Because I know what I 'm doing . Yes , well , so do I.
 I seriously doubt that .
 Well , I 've got the qualifications to prove it .
 So you think .
 Wait , what ?
 Why don 't we all go through , everyone ?
 I can make us some drinks and see to that dog .
 Are you saying I didn 't pass ?
 You told me that I passed .
 You said categorically ...
 I know .
 I may have ... omitted one or two of the finer details .
 So , I didn 't pass .
 You narrowly missed the mark on one paper , parasitology .
 But really , in the great scheme of things , just a tiny , white lie .
 You 're not serious .
 You tried so hard and I knew how disappointed you 'd be , so I just ...
 I bent the truth a little .
 You let me think I was qualified when I wasn 't .
 And then you let me carry on showing off like a complete idiot .
 All this time , I 've been a total laughing stock .
 Oh , for God 's sake , you 'd already wasted so much time on those blasted exams , I thought you 'd be better off getting out there , getting your hands dirty , and I 've been proven right , haven 't I ?
 I don 't believe you .
 Even now , you can 't admit that you 're in the wrong .
 I don 't see that I am , necessarily .
 Oh , well , there 's a surprise .
 Well , thank you so much for dinner .
 It were very nice to meet you .
 Only , Tristan did say he would drive me home .
 Not to worry , I can give you a lift , Margot .
 That 's awfully kind of you .
 I 'm sorry about all this . Please , don 't apologise .
 We shall have to have that gin sometime .
 Helen .
 I 'm sorry .
 I appreciate now that it can 't have been easy for you either .
 It 's fine , Margot .
 Really .
 Well ... .. I hope you 'll both be very happy .
 Come on , Margot !
 Goodnight , ladies .
 You 're sure I can 't help you tidy up ?
 Oh , I think a discreet exit 's probably best .
 Thanks for this . Enjoy .
 I made you some blancmange .
 I 'm sticking to liquids , thanks all the same .
 Tris ... Did you know ?

 Why didn 't you tell me ?
 I 'm so sorry .
 I only found out later .
 And your brother 's intentions weren 't bad .
 Even if , perhaps , his methods were .
 Didn 't even buy the bag , did he ?
 He was still the one who paid for it .
 You have no idea how much he cares for you .
 And worries about you .
 It 's just hard for him ...
 Hard for him ?
 That 's rich .
 I am truly sorry .
 Siegfried 's outdone himself this time .
 I mean , I 'm sure he meant well ... But the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
 So , what will it mean for the practice if Tris isn 't stepping up ?
 Well , I suppose any modernisation will have to wait .
 Helen , there 's something to talk to you about .
 It 's about Glasgow . They offered you a job .
 How did you ... ?
 Audrey thought I knew .
 Right .
 I 'm so sorry , I 've been wanting to tell you .
 Are you considering it ?
 I see .
 It 's not ...
 The chap I was covering for is leaving , so they need to replace him and , well ,
 Bill told my mum and next thing I know , she told him I 'm taking the job .
 Right .
 And are you ?
 No , I ... I don 't know .
 I need to make a decision but whatever I decide ,
 I 'll be letting people down .
 Oh , James , why didn 't you say something ?
 I didn 't want you to feel like I was putting pressure on you .
 How do you mean ?
 Helen ... .. I want to be with you .
 And that means staying in Darrowby , and I love it here , I do .
 The place , the work , the people .
 But if I stay ...
 You 'll break your mother 's heart .
 They 've given up so much for me .
 I don 't know what I 'm going to do .
 Well then , we 'll just have to work something out , won 't we ?
 Stay for another brew .
 I 'd love to .
 But I better get back and check on Tris .
 DOOR OPENS
 Have the others turned in ?
 Are you all right ?
 Just dandy .
 I mean , I 've been publicly humiliated , shown up as a laughing stock ...
 Tris ... .. but I 'm exacting my revenge with a very fine malt .
 Is that Siegfried 's special bottle ?
 Certainly was .
 Here .
 Come on .
 Misery loves company and all that .
 Would it have made a difference if you 'd found out sooner ?
 What , that I 'm a complete failure ?
 Don 't know . Maybe ignorance was bliss .
 There are plenty of fine vets with no qualifications .
 You know you can do the work , that 's what matters .
 Come on .
 Where are we going ?
