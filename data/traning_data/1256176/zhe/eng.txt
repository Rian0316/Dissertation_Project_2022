 Translation koe and Joker


 This reminds me that you can not steak , after which the doctor said on cholesterol .
 This woman wants I live forever .

 Guilty !

 - I love you .
 - I love you too . - I love you more !
 - Get out , pestinha !


 - So , I see you at the bar ?
 - Barney , what the hell is that ?
 All right , is a long history .
 As I know , my father had to leave my mother when I was a child for presenter of " The Price is Right ! "
 - Oh , yeah !
 - Absolutely .
 He is your father !
 She had to create my brother and me alone .
 And the only dream she had , was that their children ended not alone as she was .
 So seven years ago , she was very sick .
 It seemed not could escape .
 Therefore decided realize the dream of her .
 Mom , this is Betty . We are engaged .
 I hired an actress to interpret my girlfriend Betty .
 The real name it is Margaret . It shows in the theater of Broadway one time or another .
 Wonderful actress . Was so to win a Tony .
 But as you know , there is much bureaucracy , then will not go into it .
 But has a problem .
 Betty has a small tendency to flee from the roadmap . See , Mom ?
 I found someone who makes me happy . - Just like you wanted .
 - This is wonderful .
 I live just one more just to take my grandchildren .
 I 'm pregnant !


 Then my mother improved . It was a miracle , but meant that
 I have to keep Betty around , and a child to climb interpret my son , Tyler .

 This is crazy .
 Did you even test to choose your child ?
 For a while I was the nanny the children of my neighbors .
 In one Christmas when my mother was drunk with Eggnog , I cheated with a bag of flowers and a mask of Chuck .
 But there came a day that I had to do tests on cast .
 4 , 8 , and 13 can stay .
 The rest is not required .
 He said that if I sleep with you , my son would take the role .
 It seems that I am better actor than his son . Bring them to 11hs .

 So that the role Tyler went to the Grant .
 What is the Grant me looks good actor . Really ?
 Look at this .
 Hey Tyler !
 Tyler ! Tyler !

 - Grant . - You ?
 See ?
 It is an amateur sitting there .
 You can call me crazy , but the actors were children much better in the 80s .
 Barney , it seems that their Mom kept the room of his childhood in the same the way they left .
 Yes , and by the way , beautiful poster of Karate Kid .
 Karate Kid is a great movie .
 It is the story of a young man the karate wonder , whose dream
 led him across the road to Karate Championship .
 Of course , unfortunately , it loses in the final round for that nerd .
 But he learns the beautiful lesson to accept defeat .
 Wait , when you watch Karate Kid , fan for that blonde boring ?
 No , I hope for that loser of New Jersey you hardly know what karate .
 When I watch Karate Kid I hope for the real karate kid .
 Johnny Lawrence . Connects , Lily .

 I just find where you know .
 I saw you showing Misdirection in the theater ,
 last fall . You were a revelation .

 - Really ?
 - Absolutely .
 Thank you , not was sure .
 The objective of Braxford , is alienating the public , of course .

 Sorry , here is a fan of him .

 You know even the theater that attends .
 The Miss .
 Theater grabbed my heart and never released .
 Every year I put up a piece for parents with other children .
 Wow , Santa , think we can leave this snow ?
 Cut , cut and cut !
 Ricky , Grandma and Grandpa come here in half an hour and is still using my words .


 Looks like I will have to manage and operate this thing .
 Give me the hat and go sit down . I always wanted to be actor , secretly .
 One of those dreams that flee from the hands , I think .
 If you like , you can give some tips of performance . - Really ?
 - I love . Okay .
 Rule of Practice 1 .
 Do not be afraid of ...
 At least someone is encouraged to act .
 I miss it .
 So you do not like interpret the son of Barney ?
 I hate .
 But the What can I do ?
 - I find another role .
 - I know what you mean .
 I am a news presenter .
 But I had to accept a job the presenter of a morning program which goes to air at 4 : 30 in the morning .
 I should be very well applicable to that time , you know ? I am almost 30 years .
 Ah , speaking seriously .
 You is still very beautiful . I love the plastic that made the nose .
 Never did the plastic nose .
 Yeah , me neither .
 I do not believe that not before we know it . I wish that Barney had a mother so sweet .
 Thank you , honey .
 The truth is I never went the best mother when he was young .
 Do not say that I have sure was great .
 No , I was half bitch . - Excuse me ?
 - Bitch , baby .
 A dirty whore .
 I am not proud of it .
 Although I had my fun .
 There is no greater pleasure than looking in the eyes of a man thinking
 " I do not know your name , or you know my , " but in the next 8 minutes we will put you break .

 Then go in opposite directions .
 Continue driving . Mother of Barney ?
 Laurette ?
 Anyway , this is everything in the past now .
 I did the best I could , but sometimes I wonder Barney is as came out so perfect .

 You must tell the truth to your mother , understand ?
 She is a sweet woman , sweet , caring , way too detailed , you deserve something better .
 No , no way . The fact kill her .
 I do not think lying to a a lady so loving .
 She reminds me my own mother .

 Okay ...
 - What ?
 - Baby ?
 Remember our votes when I said that we would be forever ?
 On the way back , she said , not forever , baby .
 The Marshall goes to heaven . - She was making a joke .
 - She hates me , Marshall .
 But okay , because ...
 Whatever . What ?

 What say ?
 Nothing , do what you want in the room of Barney 's New ?
 - In my carpet ?
 - The feeling is great , man .
 Hey Lily , is now learned something , is that sincerity is important when it comes to family .
 Whatever it is you feel for my mother , are together for 12 years , I think I can handle .


 - Really ? - Sure .
 Okay .
 I hate his mother .
 Guess what ?
 I hate you !

 Two minutes for the cookies get ready meat !
 Meat cake ?
 Tyler does not like !


 Grant , we talked about that millions of times . You can not have a stick .

 But it is funny .
 Grant , not afraid to climb another actor .
 Go decorate their speeches to the scene of the dinner . Wait .
 You wrote we have dinner ?
 Just a short script .
 Things will my mother happy .
 For example ?
 And I really thought
 Barney had forgotten that our anniversary .
 So I went to the backyard spitting fire ...
 Huge flames , when she is angry , which I love .
 See them there .
 Look them up !
 You can stop , good guy .
 Sure . Sorry .
 Continue .
 What is really a good relationship .
 So I left to the yard ... and had candles around corner .
 And a string quartet .
 - Believe that ?
 - Not a bit .
 And my little Ty- ty , you have done ?
 Funny story .
 Another night , that silly had a nightmare .
 And when he was telling us about which was , remember what I said ?


 Page four .
 Bones of dinosaur won life and came chasing me ?
 Thanks , man , I do not needed to sleep today . No . Tyler said :
 " My nightmare was you and Mom did not knew how much I loved those .
 So I came here to say it was this big . " - How cute !
 - How happy family and baby .
 I 'll get ice cream downstairs in the fridge and comeremos sundae in the kitchen .
 Wow , no error in that scene . - Bravo ! - No fills , Barney .

 You do not know how hard work for you .
 Grant , I love your story on the bones of dinosaur . Can you stop to talk about it ?


 - Go eat your sundae .
 - I can not .
 I am intolerant to lactose .
 Guess who is not ? Tyler !
 Tyler is in there and enjoy each bite .
 - Time of the ice cream !
 - Yummy !

 My God ! - Ted !
 - Tyler does not like .
 You will not have a stick .

 - I understand . - I understand .

 I follow . I. ..
 I was betrayed by my best friend .
 How could you do that , Ted ?
 Think of the poor of Tyler ... trying bravely hold the tears .
 All right , son . You can cry . Weep .
 I do not want Mom and Dad divorced .

 What has to say in his defense ?
 1 rule of action .
 Do not be afraid to improvise .
 It was I who betrayed you ... and you betrayed me ? How ?

 Rule of action 5 .
 Make a good story for your character .
 14 November 1998 . The night train to Monte Carlo .
 I was in the car , taking a few thousand of the Algerian dinar .
 When you seduced my bride , who is blind and found you were me .
 Good !
 What are you talking about ?
 Rule of action number eight :
 Do not be afraid to be aggressive .
 You know very well what I 'm talking about .
 No , I do not know .
 You know , yes !
 And , by God , hear you say :
 Mom , can you excuse us ?
 Sure .
 Have chocolate and butterscotch .
 Has several types of sprinkler and marshmallows .
 You lost your mind ?
 You were great !
 Almost become in character .
 Not trying interpret the Ted , but leaving the way of it .
 What with ?
 As I will explain this to my mother ?
 Perhaps it is time to count the truth , Barney .
 I do not know , no .
 Sometimes , honesty leads people to say bad things about a woman who always cared about me .
 Because I was the dwarf family .
 For the love of God , I only have 1 . 93 .

 - I said well you ? - He very well .
 Even in a job you hate , you still like of what it does . See ?


 Maybe so for you in his new job .
 - You think ? - I 'm sure .

 Thanks , Grant .
 You are very intelligent , you know ?

 Sorry , sorry .
 I thought I was rolling a climate .


 - Honey , you okay ?
 - Look , Mom ... must tell you something .
 Something I should have counted for a long time .
 Tyler is dying .
 And Betty said that when it is , it will depart .
 And that everything must happen soon . - My God !
 - Okay , no , no .
 None of this is true .
 The truth is ...

 The truth is that Tyler and Betty are actors ,
 I hired to pretend to be my family . What ?
 I thought that I had the life you want .
 I wanted it proud of me .
 I know that sounds crazy , and sorry for everything .
 - So , Betty is not your wife ?
 - No .
 Thank God !
 I do not like that woman . - Really ?

 - Yes And Tyler ...
 I know that his grandmother and should love him , but hate that kid .
 " Tyler does not like . "
 - What is this drug ? - Not ?
 And those false friends give me will die .
 I know !
 They are not horrible ?
 So , seriously , is not mad ?
 No , I 'm just confused .
 Why think you should do that ?
 Barney , I love him with or no perfect family .
 I love you , no matter what happens . - Really ?
 - Really .
 I am so relieved ! Because the truth is that I am as far away from marriage possible .
 My history with women to leave shocked .

 No matter . Still love him .
 Seriously , can not imagine things I did .
 When you had three years , I left with the babysitter
 I spent 3 weeks with round like a ball .
 Mom ! Just do me a favor .

 If you know someone special , not go as I did .
 Take a chance .
 Barney , the taxi arrived .


 I will try .

 I just wanted to say that if some day seem cold or hostile , sorry .
 - Who is she talking about ? - With my mother .
 Mean much to me if we could be closer .
 Take a deep breath , as if that will say now is difficult .
 - I love you .
 - I love you ...
 - Mother - Yes !
 Mother
 - Pretend that told me something .
 - Pretend that told me something .
 I mean , its really cool Party say that , Judy .
 You , too . Bye .

 Let me get this straight .
 You are telling me when you see " Karate Kid " ,
 - No fan for Daniel Son ? - No .
 For those twists in " Hard to Kill " ?
 Hans Gruber .
 International charming bandit .
 In the end , it is hard to kill . It is the character of the title .
 Sure .
