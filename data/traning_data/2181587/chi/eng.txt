 00 : 00 : 08, 531 -- > 00 : 00 : 10, 515 Hello .
 I 'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper , and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents :
 Fun with Flags .
 Over the next 52 weeks , you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology .
 Hang on , Dr. C.
 What 's vexillology ?

 Vexillology is the study of flags . Cool .
 I think I just learned something .
 Did you have fun doing it ?
 I 'll say .
 Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast , not unlike the only two- sided state flag --
 Oregon .
 Oh , look . Hello , Mr. Beaver .


 In future episodes , we 'll answer some burning questions :
 What 's the only non- rectangular flag ? What animal appears most often on flags ?
 What animal appears second most often on flags ?
 And more .
 Sweet !
 Why are you waving a white flag ?
 I 'm surrendering ... to fun .

 ( laughs )
 Now , today 's episode of Fun with Flags is not fun , but it is important .
 " Flags : you gotta know how to hold 'em , you gotta know how to fold 'em . "
 Let 's start by identifying the parts of our flag .
 This edge is the hoist , and it 's used to ...
 Excuse me , sorry , excuse me .
 Cut .
 Did you not see we are rolling ?
 Sorry . I 'm having dinner with Penny .
 I have to get out of here .
 And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here !
 ( sighs )
 You okay ?
 No , I 'm a little rattled .
 But like the flag over Fort Sumter , I 'm still here .
 And ... take two . Hello .
 I 'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper , and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents :
 Fun with Flags .
 Over the next 52 weeks , you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology .
 Hang on , Dr. Cooper .
 What 's vexillology ?
 Vexillology is ... why is there a face on that flag ?
 It 's Ferdinand T. Flag .
 I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers .
 Confound it !
 You 're right , it 's brilliant .
 Let 's take it from the top .
 ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ...
 Wait ! ♪ ♪ The Earth began to cool ♪ The autotrophs began to drool , Neanderthals developed tools ♪ ♪ We built the Wall ♪ ♪ ♪ Math , Science , History , unraveling the mystery ♪ ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪ ♪ ♪



 Original Air Date on January 26 , 2012
 That was a really nice dinner .
 I 'm glad you asked me out again .
 Me , too ; I missed you .
 You see me all the time .
 You sure you just don 't miss the sex ?
 Well , yeah , sex with you is pretty great .
 Have you ever tried it ?
 I have .
 You are not wrong .
 I just think if we 're gonna try dating again , we should take things slow .
 Oh , I can take it slow .
 Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school , Karen Berberick ?
 To this day she doesn 't know we were going out .
 Made it easier on her when I broke things off .
 Okay , well , maybe not slow .
 How about this , are you familiar with the typical development for computer software ?
 You know , just for fun , let 's say I 'm not .
 Before an application is released , they give it a trial run .
 W- We could do that .
 And if we hit a rough spot , instead of getting mad , just say , " Hey , we found a bug , " and we report it so it can be fixed .
 You mean like a beta test ?
 Well , technically , this would be an alpha test .
 A beta test requires people that weren 't involved in the development of the appli ...
 Seriously , do I not get credit for knowing beta test ?
 No , you should . Absolutely .
 That was me being pedantic .
 That 's our first bug .
 You reported it .
 I can fix that . See ?
 This is good .
 All right .
 Let 's give it a shot . Great .
 You keep a list , I 'll keep a list .
 At some point , we 'll exchange .
 Okay .
 - Good night , Leonard .
 - Night .
 Attaboy , Hofstadter .
 Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies .
 Hey , I 'm back . SHELDON :
 Cut .
 ( sighs ) Take 47 .
 Here 's an interesting fact about flags .
 I will take that action .
 The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence , a fact that wasn 't discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics .
 And thankfully , their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism .


 Let 's see the new phone .
 I stopped on the way to work .
 Hey , do you want to peel the plastic off with me ?
 Really ?
 Me ?
 That 's , like , the best part . Grab a corner .
 ( chuckles )
 Whoa , what 's your hurry , cowboy ?
 Savor the moment .
 Oh , yeah .
 Speaking of cowboys , do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag ?
 The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra .
 Oh , the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents :
 Fun with Flags is writing itself .
 Oh , let me try the voice recognition .
 Hey , I let you peel the plastic , don 't get greedy .
 ( chimes ) Hello ? ( chimes ) SlRI :
 Hello .
 ( chimes ) What 's your name ?
 ( chimes ) My name ?
 It 's Siri .
 ( chuckling ) Look at that .
 There 's finally a woman in your life you can talk to .
 ( chimes ) Are you single ?
 ( chimes ) I don 't have a marital status , if that 's what you 're asking .
 Yeah , you 're right , that 's too personal .
 We hardly know each other .
 ( chimes )
 How about a cup of coffee ?
 ( chimes ) I 've found six coffee shops .
 Three of them are fairly close to you .
 I will see you gentlemen later .
 ( exhales ) She is gonna break his heart .
 ( ethereal music plays on TV )
 For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space ,
 Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern- day London .

 Careful , it 's that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year 's Who Con.
 Uh , we 're not counting this as a date , are we ?
 Um , I 'm not sure , but I think the right answer here is " no . "
 Bug report :
 When a guy asks me to spend time with him , maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home , watching TV .
 Even
 Even SHELDON : All right , that 's it .
 ( snaps fingers ) Who Con -- you 're out .
 Okay , bug report taken .
 Next time I will have a better plan for our evening 's activity . Well , thank you .
 I 'll see you tomorrow .
 Oh , wait , here , almost forgot .
 Here . What 's this ?
 My bug report to you .
 Well , that 's quite a list you got there .
 It 's color coded . Oh .
 Uh , red means " fix right away . "
 Yellow is " eh , whenever you get a chance . "
 And green , is " I could probably learn to live with it . "
 There 's a key down here at the bottom .
 It 's neat , huh ?
 ( smacks lips )
 Yep .
 So , have a good night .
 ( smacks lips ) Yep .
 Look at that .
 Some day , we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard .
 What 's baffling me is what you could 've possibly put on the list .
 " Hair too golden " ?
 " Laugh too musical " ?

 " World too much a better place for her mere presence in it " ?
 How about " constantly talks with food in her mouth " ?
 Her heart 's full of love , no one cares what 's in her mouth .
 ( chimes ) So , Siri , what 's happening ?
 How are you ?
 ( chimes ) I am well . ( chimes ) What are you doing right now ?
 ( chimes ) What am I doing ?
 I 'm talking with you .
 ( chimes ) You have a beautiful voice .
 ( chimes ) Thank you , it 's nice to be appreciated .
 I bet it is .
 ( chimes ) Why don 't women like me ?
 ( chimes ) Let me check on that .
 How about a Web search for " Why don 't women like me ? " No need .
 I 've already done that .
 ( chimes ) Siri , do you have a last name ?
 ( chimes ) My name is Siri .
 Ah , one name .
 Like , uh , Cher , Madonna , Adele .
 All the women who rock me .
 ( chimes ) My name is Rajesh , but you can call me Raj .
 ( chimes ) Would you like me to call you Raj ?
 ( chimes ) I 'd like you to call me sexy .
 ( chimes ) From now on , I 'll call you sexy .
 Okay ?
 Okay !
 ( chimes ) Siri , I 'm in the mood for gelato .
 ( chimes ) I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato .
 Seven of them are fairly close to you .
 ( chimes ) Thank you , darling .
 ( chimes ) You are most certainly welcome , sexy .
 Well done , Dr. Koothrappali .
 I 'm sorry ?
 You 've taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine .
 Kudos .
 I haven 't bonded with it .
 Oh , no , of course .
 I understand .
 You 're afraid the world isn 't ready for your taboo love .
 Your secret 's safe with me .
 It 's just a phone .
 Cooper .
 Kripke .
 Heads up .
 Professor Rothman urinated in the particle physics wab again , so we 're going to move up his wetirement party .
 Fwiday , 5 : 00 -- pot wuck .
 Thanks , Barry .
 ( chimes ) Siri , remind me
 Friday morning to make my famous popovers .
 ( chimes ) All right , I 'll remind you .
 You got Siwi , huh ?
 Voice wecognition on that thing is terrible .
 Wook .
 ( chimes ) Siwi , can you wecommend a westauwant ?
 ( chimes ) SlRI : I 'm sorry , Bawwy .
 I don 't understand " wecommend a westauwant . "
 ( chimes ) Wisten to me .
 Not westauwant ; westauwant .
 ( chimes ) I don 't know what you mean by " not westauwant ; westauwant . "
 See ?
 Total cwap .
 You suck , Siwi .
 Hey , don 't talk to her like that . She 's a lady .
 Well , that wady took high- wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist .
 Waiter .
 PENNY :
 It 's open .
 Hey . You ready to go ?
 Yeah , hang on .
 Let me just finish this chapter .
 Can you finish it later ?
 No , I can 't .
 Reading books is a big part of my life now because , you know , we 'd have more fun things to talk about if I read more .
 Great . Good .
 Great .
 What are you reading ?

 They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that , don 't they ?
 All right .
 Look , just remember how this works .
 We don 't get mad about these things .
 Uh , speaking of which , I 've addressed your bug report on my date planning .
 Got a really fun evening for you .
 It 's kind of a surprise .
 All right . Terrific .
 Well , let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren 't so tall .
 We wouldn 't want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy .
 Thank you . Yeah .
 Oh .
 Here 's my list for you -- right there .
 ( clears throat )
 All right , fair enough .
 I certainly can be quieter when we kiss .
 I thought it was an expression of passion , but if it 's coming across as " juicy and weird , " who wants that ?
 Uh , uh ...
 I 'm sorry .
 Can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are " stupid " ?
 Na , never mind .
 It 's right here .
 Good timing .
 Dinner 's almost ready .
 Great .
 Oh , smells amazing in here .
 Oh , what are we eating ?
 Oh , an exotic little treat .
 I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck , and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers , two of which were fairly close to me .
 Her spontaneity is contagious .
 Who 's Siri ?
 Is he dating somebody new ?
 Yes .
 His phone .
 Oh .
 Is that cute or creepy ?
 Uh- huh .
 Can I pour you some wine ?
 I think you 'll enjoy it .
 The traditional choice with Peking duck is a sauvignon blanc , but Siri suggested an off- dry Riesling .

 I wasn 't sure , but I didn 't want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe 's .

 Now , what should we put Siri in for dinner ?
 Leopard , sparkles , or to paraphrase Coco Chanel , you can never go wrong with a little black case ?


 ( chimes ) Siri , play some smooth jazz .
 ( chimes ) Playing smooth jazz .
 ( Kenny G music playing )
 Oh , my God , Kenny G ? !
 This woman can read me like a book .
 I can 't believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria .
 ( whispering ) : I don 't know if I want to stay .
 ( gunfire )
 This is amazing . How did you even get this idea ?
 I called your dad .
 I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid .
 This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it .
 Okay , you 're kind of really great .
 You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest ?
 Okay , bug report .
 I just complimented you .
 You should take it and shut up .
 Right .
 Sorry , sorry .
 And stop apologizing all the time .
 Right .
 Sorry .
 All right , let 's shoot stuff .
 You want me to show you what to do ?
 I play a lot of
 I think I know how to handle a gat .
 Wow .
 You are cute when you get all gangsta .
 ( gunshot ) ( yells )
 ( yelling ) ( whining )
 Ooh !
 ( panting )
 So , I 've got a gunshot wound .
 That 's pretty bad- ass .
 No , you 've got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe .
 ( laughs )
 Hello ?
 They gave me a Band- Aid .
 Hospitals do not issue Band- Aids unless it is medically necessary .
 That is the law .
 ( laughs ) Well , thank you for a really cool evening .
 Thank you for hiding my socks at the emergency room .
 ( laughs ) Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand ?

 Things are looking good .
 So , are we still taking things slow ?
 Because a gunshot wound today , and last week , I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer .
 We don 't know how much time I have .
 Good night , you .

 First door on the left .
 Thank you .
 ( sighs )
 Dave , I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area .
 Four are fairly close to you .
 ( clearing his throat )
 Hello , sexy .
 What can I help you with ?
 If you 'd like to make love to me , just tell me .
 ( guttural utterances )
 I 'm sorry .
 I don 't understand ... ( guttural utterances )
 No !
