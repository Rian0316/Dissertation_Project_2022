 00 : 00 : 08, 600 -- > 00 : 00 : 10, 679 So , if we 're ready for signature ... ?
 You can absolutely guarantee it 'll be the final leg ? No question .

 Anything else would be in breach of contract .
 Who 's giving it to me ?
 - Excellent question , Phoebe !
 - Who 's giving it to her ?
 Er ... Anthony ?
 Erm ...
 Dame Kelly Holmes .
 Ooh ...
 I don 't know who she is .
 - She 's an olympic athlete .
 - I don 't care .
 I can have who I want , can 't I , mummy ?
 Daddy said !
 Well , darling ...
 Why can 't I ever have anything I want ?

 Well , it 's ... Do we have any other choices ?

 Erm ...
 Lord Coe .
 - No .
 - Sir Ian Botham ?
 - No .
 - Sir Ian Mckellen ?
 - No .

 - Justin Bieber .
 - Yes ?
 He 'll be fine .
 Marvellous .
 We 've brought along a replica so that Phoebe has plenty of time to prepare .

 So , you pick up from Justin , then it 's up the steps and Bob 's your Uncle .
 You 're a very lucky girl .
 Actually , it has nothing to do with luck .
 My daddy is very , very , very rich .

 She 's v proud of her father .
 And he says I can have whatever I want , because I 'm his princess .
 Yes , you are .
 So , all we need now is your sponsorship cheque .
 Of course .
 Good .
 Well , it 's been an absolute pleasure .
 How exciting !
 Lucinda will be completely sick .
 All she 's doing is a stupid dance .
 She 'll be one of hundreds , but I 'll be special .
 Yes , you will , poppet .
 So what happens now ?
 All the paperwork will come through in about a week or so - rehearsal dates , vip passes , details , etc .
 Just make sure you 've marked July 27th on your calendar .
 Abso- bloody- lutely !
 Say thank you , Phoebe .
 She 's highly strung .
 V creative .
 Oh , bless her .
 How 'd it go ?
 - Like taking candy from a baby .
 - Ah- ha .

 It 's funny how you enjoy some jobs more than others .
 Because some people are more deserving than others .
 - Makes it all the sweeter . - Yes , it does .
 Mind you ...
 A hundred grand ain 't to be sniffed at .
 No . It 's a lot of clothes .

 To tell you the truth , they had way too much money anyway .
 I mean , when you think about it , we 're a bit like Robin Hood .
 Yeah , well , we do take from the rich ...

 Only instead of giving it to the poor ... we buy clothes .
 Which isn 't quite as catchy .
 No - but we look great .

 You 've gotta love the Olympics .
 Apart from the fact they 're turning the east end into a chinless wonder 's paradise .
 So far , we 've sold 12 non- existent executive boxes and three olympic torch runs .
 She was such a brat .
 Yeah , no wonder the country is in the state it 's in .

 The way some people bring up their children .
 All I had at her age was a sherbet dib dab and a hula hoop .
 I used to beat you hands down every time .
 You bragging ?
 Snake hips Kennedy , they used to call me .

 Actually , he called himself that .
 Only cos I used to beat you .
 Yes , because I couldn 't get it off you , that 's why .
 All right , children - we 've made 100 grand , you can all have hoops .
 Sure that 's wise at Albert 's age ?
 He might do himself a mischief .
 Oh ? Well , I could teach you youngsters a thing or two .

 Yes , you could , Albert .
 I 've worked something out about you lot .
 You 're like big kids .
 Yeah ?

 I realised when you said you had a 100 grand so everyone could have hoops .
 Who in their right mind , if they had a £100, 000 , would even think about spending it on hoops ?
 What have you got against hoops , Eddie ?
 He 's hoopist . Could 've had a bad experience as a child .
 - Yeah , he got all tangled up ...
 - Couldn 't quite get the rhythm ...
 See ?
 You 're like big kids , messing about ...
 Are you making a point here , Ed , or just having a northern rant ?
 There is a point , actually .

 One of you did this to Rushie !

 Hang on .
 How do you know it was one of us ?
 Cos it happened last night , and you were the only ones in here .
 Right . Right ?
 So ?
 Who was it ?
 Well , whoever it was can 't draw , cos his moustache is rubbish .
 That 's his real one .

 You 've defiled him !
 Look at him !
 It 's not right , this !
 This man was poetry in shorts .
 Summat funny , Michael ?

 No .
 Sorry .
 Right , well - until one of you owns up , you 're barred .
 Eh ?
 Barred ? That 's a bit strong , innit Ed ? Especially as we 're your partners .

 I don 't mind all the banter and the general abuse , but this is going too far !
 All right , I think someone better own up .
 - What you looking at me for ?
 - Well , you 're the football nut .

 - Oi , oi , we 're not all hooligans .
 - Well , it wasn 't me .
 Right , well - you 're barred , all of you , till I find out who done it .
 I mean it !

 Let 's go .
 Well , go on .
 Come on .
 - Barred ?
 - Barred !
 I 'm serious , guys .
 It 's taken me years to teach Eddie how to make a proper breakfast .
 Yes - not to mention losing our office .

 Yeah , well , he 's got that scouse resolve .
 He won 't give up till one of us admits it .
 So go on .
 Who was it ?
 ( Albert coughs uneasily )
 - I 'm Spartacus .
 - You ? !

 - I did the ears .
 - I er ... I did the glasses .
 And the beard ?

 Ready for this ?
 Watch .
 ( They all giggle and mutter )
 ( Hide the pen . )
 See ... ?
 Well , that wasn 't very grown- up , was it ?
 Albert started it .
 - Hey , come on you snitch .
 - Oh , come on , don 't even start .
 All right , that 's enough , that 's enough .
 - We can worry about Eddie later .
 Albert 's got a new mark .
 - Oh , who ?
 It 's er .. Kind of personal .
 Ash , would you ... Help me out ?
 This is Dexter Gold .
 That 's not his real name , he changed it by deed poll four years ago .
 - What 's his real name ? - Dexter Pratt .
 Started up a " gold hard cash " website when the economy went into turmoil and he made a small fortune .
 Classy guy .
 Basically people who needed a few extra pounds saw his ads in the newspapers , sent their jewellery in , and he conned them by paying out a fraction of what it was worth .


 That is how I found him .
 ( Indistinct chatter )
 Excuse me for just for just a moment . Sorry .

 Madam ?
 ' Vivienne marchant hit hard times
 ' when her husband died three years ago . ' the worst thing is , I feel so stupid .
 Oh , no , no .
 There was a time , when if it was in a newspaper written in black and white , it was true !
 - Better days .
 - My George would be furious .
 He 'd have gone round there , given him what for .
 I 'm sure he would .
 Well , I tried !

 He just laughed at me .
 Said the conditions were written down .

 In small print , no doubt .
 It 's really good of you to help me , Albert .
 You can 't be too careful who you trust these days , my dear .
 After all , you only met me , what , three days ago ? The world isn 't what it was .

 I could be a con- man too .


 Oh , don 't be so daft !
 ( Dog growls quietly )
 She sent this piece of filth - listen to this - two 24 carat gold rings , a diamond brooch .

 60 years of memories .

 He sent her back £28 . 50 .
 - Bastard .
 - If we don 't take this bloke for every penny he 's got ,
 I 'll smack him in the mouth just for fun .
 Don 't worry , Ash , he 'll receive our full attention .
 Ah , yes , there is a bit of a problem .
 Isn 't there always ?
 Michael ?
 We checked him out and his gold hard cash business , it seems , is just a sideline .

 He was connected to the gold bullion robbery at Gatwick in 2008 and the Tottenham warehouse gold heist last year .
 He 's a fence ?
 He 's a middle man for stolen gold bullion .
 He uses his Gold Hard Cash business as a cover to melt it down and sell it on .
 What difference does it make if he 's a crook ?
 Well , he 's not just a crook , he 's one of the chaps .
 ♪ when the pimp 's in the crib drop it like it 's hot ♪ drop it like it 's hot ♪ drop it like it 's hot ♪ when the pigs try to give it you ♪ park it like it 's hot ♪ park it like it 's hot ♪ lf a ... get a attitude ♪ pop it like it 's hot pop it like it 's hot ♪ pop it like it 's hot ... ♪









 So , because of the circles he mixes in , we don 't want him coming after us .
 Or worse , telling one of his gangster friends he 's been conned and offering them a better deal if they take care of us .



 So , if we do this , we need to close it off when we 're done .
 - Agreed ?
 - Yeah .
 Yeah . Good .
 Then let 's find a way in .
 Bish bosh , job 's a good 'un .

 Write the cheque , send it to number one ,
 Winners Street , daddy 's bringing home the bacon .
 When I said this deal was 24 carat , was I right or was I wrong ?
 Hang on .
 Talk on your own time .
 You touch that bleedin ' phone again and I 'll shove it up your jacksy .
 So was I right or wrong ?
 No , don 't just laugh and say " yeah , " Peter , actually say the words ...
 Was I right or wrong ?
 Exactly , you get your deal sorted out before you spend your money .
 Capiche ?
 We 're middle men , not investors , when we get the deal , they get the deal , ok ?
 Now sod off and next time listen to me instead of that poxy business degree you wasted five years of your life on .
 Shania , get your arse over here .
 Me mug 's empty .
 Excuse me ?
 What have I told you ?
 Mug of tea , the minute I get in .
 Well , he likes his movies .
 - Movies ?
 - Yeah , I just hacked into his online DVD rentals account .
 He 's got 27 films in three weeks .
 Porn ?
 Strangely enough , no , they all look like war films . - War ?
 - Yeah .
 What does that say about him ?
 - That he likes to watch people being shot and blown up .
 - Nice .
 If he likes war movies ...
 What about this ?
 It looks like Gadaffi was trying to ship out some of his goodies while the yanks were taking pot shots at him and a couple of truck loads went missing .

 One of which was thought to be gold bullion .
 They think it 's a rogue army unit .
 So we use this as our back story ?
 Why not ?
 It fits his personality .
 It 's true , so it 'll check out , and it saves time having to set something up from scratch .
 Hi .
 How you doing ?
 - There you go .
 - Thanks , bye .
 Cheers .
 Honestly , he is so sexist , apparently every woman in flat shoes is a lesbian .
 No wonder he hasn 't got a girlfriend .

 Thing is , Baz , splitting up consignments ain 't doing us any favours , we need someone who can take the lot .

 I 'm seeing this German geezer later on , he says he can take whatever we 've got .
 I ain 't trying to pull a fast one , but a Troy ounce of gold was 875 quid when I woke up this morning .

 Now , unless you know something I don 't , why would I get less than that ?
 We 'll give you 875 for your domestic business , but we are aware that sometimes your sources are not always ...

 Legitimate ?
 So , if you want to use us but you don 't want us to ask , " where is it coming from ? "
 Then we like to pay a little less , ja ?
 Yeah , yeah .
 So , uh ... How much can you take ?
 We have no upper limit .
 - And payment ?
 - What 's your preference ?
 Cash .
 The money laundering laws are very stringent in Germany .

 - Bankers draft or direct transfers .
 - Agreed .
 We have a 2m euro ceiling on direct transfers .
 Looks like you 've found your UK supplier .
 You see , melting down trinkets sent in by wrinklies feeling the pinch ain 't going to build my new pool , is it , Barry ?
 Let 's be honest .
 And the dealers are squeezing all the margins , so ...
 The krauts have agreed to take whatever we can supply , no upper limit .
 So , bish bosh , open up the till , keep the change .
 So , when do we start , boss ?
 I told him I 'd send him his first shipment at the end of next week .
 There 's a couple of the lads planning jobs .
 A cargo terminal at Stansted and an arab bank in Kensington .
 But they 're a few weeks away , so , if there 's no hooky gold about ,
 let 's get a few more press ads running .
 Knitting magazines , something to terrify the bingo squad ,

 " recession to bite deep , fuel prices to soar .
 " The cost of cardigans and blue rinses to go through the roof .
 " What use is your wedding ring if you can 't turn the heating on ? "
 Maybe do a special offer for widows !

 I like what you did there , Baz . And then let 's start with the housewives , make 'em feel guilty about their kids not having the latest video games while they 're still dripping in gold . Yeah .






 Do some photos of kids ... Crying .
 Right , get on with it !
 I 'm on it , boss !
 Big push , Baz , ok ?
 Shania ?
 Sean , what have you got ?
 Well , according to his pa , he 's single , in between girlfriends , which is his usual state , he 's not a member of any clubs , only drinks champagne , preferably bollinger , hates dogs , women in flat shoes and bread- and- butter pudding .



 And his lucky number 's five .
 So ... supports Tottenham , never goes to live matches , his favourite singers are Michael Buble , Shirley Bassey and Madonna .

 His favourite film is saving private Ryan .
 Plays paintball on the weekend .

 Favourite colour 's gold .
 On the rare occasion he does go to a fancy dress party he goes as auric goldfinger , the bloke from the bond film , but no- one ever knows who he is .
 Oh , and he 's got a parrot named Goldie .


 Ok .
 Emma ?
 He 's listed as a director of 11 companies , all gold- related , with a combined turnover of £3m , so , I think we can say he 's above the poverty line .
 - Props ?
 - Everything 's in place , ready to go .
 And what about our bait ?
 Ah , our bait ... .. Looks a little something like ... .. This .
 Ooh ...

 Wow .
 Is that real ?
 Oh , yes .
 32 grand 's worth , give or take .
 It 's rented , so it has to go back in one piece when we 're done .
 That should get his attention .
 Oh ... he 's got a four o 'clock meeting out in the sticks .
 Then let 's bring him in .
 ( Music blares ) ( He sings tunelessly )
 ( Thud of an impact )
 Hngh ... ? !
 - Do you want to die ? - No .
 In about 15 seconds , six blokes are going to come out of the woods .
 They 'll kill me first , then shoot you just for fun .
 So , get in the car and drive .
 Now !
 He 's in .
 They jumped me on the way back from their so- called dealers .
 It must have been a setup .
 No , no , no , I flagged a ride .
 No , he 's a civilian , it 's all right .
 I 'll be back in an hour , you just sit tight .
 Ok , look , I 'm sorry to drag you into this , but I was up shit creek and you just happened to be there .
 You saved my life .
 I owe you one .
 Who was after you ?
 Greedy bastards , that 's who .
 But you got me out and that takes guts .
 You ever been in the forces ?
 No .
 I thought about the ta once .
 Oh , you should do it .
 Yeah ?
 Yeah .
 Is that what I think it was ?

 What if it was ?
 I heard you on the phone , about the dealer .
 - Am I going to have trouble with you , son ?
 - No , no . The thing is , that 's what I do .
 What ? I 'm a gold dealer .

 Yeah , yeah , course you are .
 Listen , thanks for the ride , sorry for the inconvenience .
 No !
 No , look , look .
 Here 's my card .
 If you got something to sell , I can find a buyer .
 You think it worked ?
 Well , that 's the thing about greed .
 It 's very predictable .
 Great .

 Sean , can you get us into his offices tomorrow morning ?
 Yeah , I 'll call Shania , my new best friend .
 Look , we 've got to do something about Eddie .
 Yeah , I said that .

 There we go .
 Enjoy .
 - We need to do something about Eddie .
 - I have an idea .
 Oh , yeah ? I 'm going to call in a favour .

 ( Phone rings )
 Hello , Eddie 's bar .
 - It 's Ian rush here .
 - 'What ? ' do me a favour , that 's pathetic .
 You don 't even sound like him .
 Hey , listen , I don 't know who you are , but you can tell that lot that I 'm not as stupid as they think I am , all right ?
 Ya f ...
 Nice try , but he didn 't believe us .
 Ok . Albert , Emma .
 See if you can work on him .
 Hey , why me ?
 I didn 't draw ears on his football hero !
 He 's got a soft spot for you .
 I 'm not sleeping with him just so Ash can have a fry up .
 - That 's your trouble , ems . You 're selfish . - Not funny .

 Just tell him it was Albert .
 He can apologise , end of .
 - Oh , but why me ?
 - Oh , Mickey then .
 We won 't tell him it was Mickey , cos he 'll make Mickey 's life a misery .
 Albert , tell him it was Sean .
 Hang on a minute !
 Sean , you 're the youngest .
 Well , if you grass me up , I 'm taking you all down with me .
 Aren 't we forgetting something here ?
 It is Eddie we 're talking about .
 Ash is right , I 'm sending two premier league grifters to deal with one barman , it shouldn 't be a contest .

 He 's really stubborn , though .
 You 'll think of something .
 Brass may be your best bet .
 It won 't be cheap but it will look the part once it 's melted down and moulded into blocks .

 Well , give us a ball park , Arnie .
 Five grand if I get it back , ten if I don 't .
 Done .
 Ok .
 What about this ?
 What do you need ?
 A different seal on it .
 Well , I 'll have to melt it down so I can stamp it .
 Can you do that ?
 If it 's made of metal , Mickey , I can do anything .
 ( Ash sniggers )
 Metal Mickey ?
 Never mind .
 What seal do you need on it ? This one .

 We 'll see you at 8 . 30 .
 - I don 't believe you .
 - It 's true .
 You wouldn 't do that , Albert , - you 're just protecting someone .

 - Eddie ! Why ask one of us to apologise if , when we do , you don 't believe us ?
 - You 're just taking me for a mug .
 - No , we 're not .
 What about the fella you got to phone up ?
 - The one pretending to be Ian rush ?
 - No , it actually was Ian rush .
 You 're doing it again , treating me like an idiot .
 Eddie , you 're impossible !
 - And you 're barred .
 - Would it help if I slept with you ?
 - No .
 - What ? !
 Sorry , I panicked just then , I meant to say yeah .
 Eddie !
 Listen , I know he did it and until he comes here in person , apologises and says in front of witnesses that liverpool FC are better than west ham , then you 're staying barred .
 It 's not happening .
 I mean , the flaming cheek of it , and I never did it .
 He 's convinced himself it was you and there 's no persuading him otherwise .
 Come on , Ash , man up . Take one for the team .

 No .
 It 'll take you 20 seconds , how hard can it be ?
 I ain 't done it .
 - You are as stubborn as each other .
 - I didn 't do anything !
 Think of Eddie 's breakfast .
 Yeah , he 's finally got his fried bread right .
 Crunchy crust , a bit soggy in the middle .
 No .
 I 'd rather starve .

 Thanks .
 His diary 's full but he 's got a gap in ten minutes ...
 Right .
 Morning .
 We set ?
 Yeah , if you lose it , I 'm stopping it out your wages .
 Wish me luck .
 You gave this to a friend of mine yesterday .
 ♪ oh , it feels so good ♪ to have you by my side on a Sunday morning ♪ let 's work together , baby , yeah . ♪

 Shania !
 Get yourself a cup of tea , love .

 You were kind enough to give him a lift .

 So what 's on your mind ?
 Oh , I think you know why I 'm here .
 Why don 't you spell it out for me ?

 We have some merchandise .
 We 're having trouble finding a buyer .
 Yeah , so I heard .
 That doesn 't mean you won 't have to pay a decent price .
 You 'll have to let the dog see the rabbit first .
 Libyan ?
 Problem ? Not for me .
 So you 're interested , then ?

 It 's what I do .
 I 'm a middle man .
 I find two parties , each wanting something the other has , and no way of coming together ...
 So , really , I 'm a facilitator .
 The bottom line is , I can find a buyer for that with one phone call .
 - Good .
 - As long as you and your boyfriend understand three things .
 I 'm assuming he is your boyfriend ?

 Yes , he is .

 That 's what I thought .
 - Where was I ?
 - Three things ?
 Yeah , right .
 I 'm not a mug , apart from the Libyan stamp , all that drama yesterday tells me it 's obviously nicked , and , er ...

 I read the newspapers like everybody else ...
 I know where this has come from , so the price I pay will have to reflect that .

 Second .
 My commission for negotiating this deal is 20 % at your end , non- negotiable .
 And third ?
 If you so much as think about turning me over ,
 I know people who can track you down and hurt you so much you 'll be begging them to finish you off .
 I 'll pass it on .

 Once we 've agreed a price , just let us know where they need to go .
 You mean there 's more than one ?
 Yes .
 So ... how many we talking about exactly ?
 A hundred .

 A hundred !
 All the same as that one ?
 You mean you 've got the whole lot ?
 You trying to tell me it was you ...
 If this is too big for you ...

 Oh , no ... it might take more than one phone call that 's all ...

 Can I see them ?
 I don 't know .
 My contacts don 't like being pissed about .
 If I don 't see the goods , I don 't pick up the phone .
 It 's your choice .

 The place where you dropped our mutual friend , two o 'clock this afternoon .
 Holy shit .
 I think we have a nibble .
 Shania !

 Get Heinz Zimmerman on the phone .

 Then put the kettle on .
 Will it stand up ?
 To what ? - Inspection .
 - 100 % .
 - Good .
 As long as you don 't get within six feet .

 This ain 't chicken feed , Heinz , we 're talking 100 kilos of 24 carat , this is a serious shipment .
 When 's it ready ?
 Well , we 'll need to melt it down and restamp , but I can ...
 I can do the paperwork ... The question is can you handle it ?

 You talk the talk buddy , it 's time to walk the walk .
 There 's three mill 's worth here , are you in or are you out ?
 ' Ok we have a deal , I 'll be there . ' good call , be in touch .
 ♪ yo , mic check , mic check ♪ yeah here you go nah , here , over here ♪ yeah , I heard he got that hot new thing ♪ oh- la- la- la .


 Yeah oh , yeah , yeah turn it over . ♪
 all right , babes ?
 Don 't move or I 'm gonna blow your brains out , do you hear me ?

 Eddie 's isn 't the only bar in London .
 Maybe we should just find somewhere else ?
 No , no , we 'll find a way to sort it .
 Sorry about that , but we can 't disclose our location .
 The British army have sent a special ops unit to find us .
 Oh , well , fair enough then !
 Oh , don 't mind him .
 He 's just not the trusting type .
 You all right then ?

 So , you think you can get us a deal ?
 Yes , I do . But it won 't be easy , as I told your lady friend here .
 - How much ?
 - Well , that 's hard to say .
 - What was I telling you ? - Relax .


 There 's 100 bars .

 I looked it up , they 're worth about 30 grand each .
 If you buy 'em from the bank of england , yeah , maybe ...
 But you won 't get anything near that , not for a shipment like this .

 You can 't move gold on without paperwork .
 You need to , er , melt it down , give it a new identity , feed it back into the system .
 That takes time and money .
 You talking to us about it not being easy ?
 Three months ago , we 'd just done a black ops stint in Libya , dodging yank cruise missiles and apache gun ships , smuggling rebel supporters out of tripoli before gaddafi got to them .
 Gaddafi got his secret police to move his stash of goodies before the rebels arrived .
 Artwork , cash ... gold .
 He died , we caught the gold truck on the road out of tripoli .
 And we ... Relieved them of it .
 Now we have not fought our way across half of Africa , carrying 100 kilos in gold bars and then smuggled them into the uk , just so some smarmy scumbag civilian can try to rip us off .

 Do you get me ?
 Back off , corporal .

 ( He laughs )
 Yes , sir .
 ( He continues laughing )
 How much ?
 I can get you half a million , transferred into any account , you like , anywhere in the world in 20 seconds .
 I 'd rather shoot him where he stands .
 You want to spend another two weeks in here ! ?
 We 've been screwed over twice now .
 You won 't get a better price , I guarantee it .
 He 's playing us .
 Half a million pounds is a lot of money .
 What about half a million , but no commission ?
 You make what you can when you move it on .
 - Commission is non- negotiable . - Yeah ? I say we negotiate .
 All right !
 Ok !
 - Forget the commission .
 Heart of gold , that 's my trouble .
 - When ?
 I need to verify the shipment first .
 I mean a sample , check the purity .
 What else ?
 Well , if it all checks out , I can get this done in 24 hours . Bish bosh !

 24 hours .
 Well ? Bloody hell , boss .
 - It 's top end , 24 carat .
 - And ?
 Well , it 's Libyan government seal , it 's about as kosher as it gets .
 What 's it worth ?
 Gold price this morning was up a bit , so ... just about £33, 500 ?
 So 100 bars ... ?

 Three million , three hundred thousand , and change .
 Hmm .
 - Grub 's up .
 - Great !
 The mark just called , everything 's set up for tomorrow .
 We 're just running through a few things .
 - Oh , right . Er , two COD , Albert .

 - Thank you .
 - And one for Mickey .
 Pie for me , haddock for ems ...
 - .. And a saveloy for Sean .
 - Saveloy !
 So , when did he phone ? About 20 minutes ago .

 It 'll be a pleasure to take his money .
 If this works , Albert was thinking of giving some money to Vivienne , you know , maybe send her on a cruise or something .
 Great idea .
 Don 't forget , we 've still got to sort Eddie out as well .
 Yes , we do . I 'm not apologising for something I didn 't do .
 - No , of course not , no- one would expect you to .
 - Sean had an idea .
 Mm , I mean , he wouldn 't believe me that it was Albert , but I reckon , if I try hard enough , I can convince him it was me .
 What , you 'd hold your hand up ?
 Yeah , if that 's what it takes to fix it then that 's what I have to do .
 Well , I think that 's brilliant , Sean .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it is .
 Only thing is , I 'm not sure what to say to him .
 - Just say sorry for scribbling on his photo .
 - Yeah , that 's fine .
 No , no , no , no , it was more than that , it was Ian rush .
 He 's football royalty for scousers .
 No , you 've got to say something like , erm ...
 I 'm sorry for defacing the photograph of the greatest footballer who ever lived .
 Sounds a bit over the top .
 Yeah , well he 's obsessed , I 'm telling you .
 What about the other thing , though ?
 That he wants us to say that liverpool is better than west ham ?
 No , no , that was just for Ash .

 I don 't even support west ham .
 - They were relegated !
 - Oi , they weren 't relegated in that way .

 So how many ways are there ?
 That 's what a lot of people think , you see , that west ham went down because they weren 't any good , but that 's not true .

 No , no , we just went in the championship for a rest , right ?
 To take a break before we launched our next assault on the premiership .
 - So should I say it or not ?
 - Well , Eddie is stubborn remember .
 Just tell him that liverpool are the greatest team on the planet .
 Yes , he would definitely go for that .
 And when he 's gone for that and shaken hands ,
 - give him a message from Ash .
 - Yeah ? What 's that ?
 That liverpool play like bunch of girls and west ham are the only proper team in Europe .
 That 's not going to help .
 It is true , honestly .

 All right ...
 Sean , it is very kind of you to do this , but let 's move on .
 Tomorrow , at nine , Emma sets up the mark .
 Ash , make sure the bars are in place .

 And remember , we need to make sure this guy believes that this is just a deal that 's gone wrong , not that he 's been conned .
 Ok ?
 So Albert and I will work out a way of blowing him out clean .
 Meet you at my car .
 I 'll see you there .
 You all right ?

 Well ?

 I assume it all checked out .
 Good as gold .
 So we have a deal ?
 When and where ?
 Under the motorway , same as last time .
 One hour .
 - You 'd better get on to your buyer .
 - All right .
 Shania !
 Get Heinz on the phone . Now !

 ( Phone rings )
 Heinz !
 Happy days , we 're on .
 Barry will bring you to the meeting point , stick behind us in my car .
 I 'll be there . Bring your cheque book .


 All right ?
 You ready ?
 Oh , yeah .
 Well , let 's get on with it then .
 Unless you want a 50- strong special ops unit dropping in to spoil the party .
 He 's setting us up !

 Whoa !
 Whoa ! No !
 No , they 're with me !

 No ! It 's all right !
 It 's all good !
 It 's good as gold .
 No , see , they 're with me .
 That 's my lad , Barry . He 's brought my buyer .
 See , I 'm the middle man , he 's the buyer .
 He pays me , I pay you , that 's how it works .
 Ok ?
 - What do you need ?
 - See the gold .
 Er , we need to see the goods .
 Sir ?
 You 'll like this , Heinz .
 I verified the gold .
 See ?
 Everyone 's happy !
 It 's all good .
 It 's just business , that 's all .
 Freeze ! Yo , back up !
 Tell him to back up !
 It 's ok !
 I 'm going to pay you now .

 ( He chuckles )
 ( Rumbling sound )
 They 're on to us !

 You nearly got us bloody killed .
 I hope our next delivery is not quite so eventful .
 Yeah , sorry about that , Heinz . But all 's well and all that , yeah ?

 Chin up !
 Auf wiedersehen !

 Right .
 Get back to the office , see how them ads are doing .
 Can 't I come back with you ?
 No you can 't , I 've got things to do .
 Look , there 's a bus stop over there .
 Sorry , sir .
 Closed .
 What do you mean it 's closed ?
 It 's one o 'clock !
 I 've got a bankers ' draft to cash .
 - The bank ceased trading at 11 . 30 this morning , sir .
 - What ! ?
 I 'm not sure of the details , sir , but the bank 's assets have been seized and all trading suspended .

 But ... but ... I 've got a ... I 've got a bankers draft !




 Here ! Look !
 It 's a bank draft !
 See !
 They have to pay it !
 Like I said , I 'm sorry , sir , but all trading has been suspended .
 - Bankers draft or direct transfers .
 - Agreed .
 Looks like you 've found your uk supplier .
 Good .
 This friend of mine got two tickets for the archery , he was hacked off - he didn 't know they did archery there .
 He said it would 've been all right , though .
 Excuse me for just a moment .
 Sure .

 Sorry .
 You talked the talk , it 's time to walk the walk .
 There 's three mill 's worth here , are you in or are you out ?
 Ok , we have a deal .
 I 'll take them all . Good call .
 Be in touch .

 I can do the paperwork , but can you handle it ?
 You 've talked the talk , it 's time to walk the walk .
 There 's three mill 's worth here , are you in or out ?
 Ok , we have a deal .
 - I 'll take them all .
 - Good call .
 Be in touch .
 As brilliant as ever you were .
 Thank you , Paul .
 Shania !
 Get Heinz on the phone .
 Now !
 ( Phone rings )
 Mm- hmm .
 ' Heinz ! Happy days !

 ' We 're on ! '
 I 'll be there .
 It 's all good . See ?
 Everyone 's happy !
 I 'd better get this melted back down .
 Ah , but ... not this one .
 You , eh ... You sure that 's the right one ?

 Thank you . For you guys , any time .


 I knew you were good but getting the army onside ? How did that work ?

 Can I ask why you 're selling ?
 There 's an army base half a mile away , they 're meant to do their manoeuvres in the next field .
 But they keep getting lost and ending up on my farm .
 Every Tuesday and Saturday at noon .
 Just like clockwork .
 ( Alarm bleeps )
 Trade secret .
 We could tell you but we 'd have to kill you .
 Fair enough .
 We had to change the seal but it 's all there .
 - It 's done . - All right ?

 - Let 's get rid of Heinz 's phone .
 Hi . This is for you .


 ( Phone rings )
 Hello ?
 Your cheque 's no good ! You nicked my gold !

 Who is that ?
 It 's Norman .
 ' Cock- a- doodle- doo . '
 ' hello ? ' ' hello ? ' ' hello ! ' ' hello ? ! '

 so Eddie 's all sorted ?
 Like it never happened .
 So what , you apologised , bigged up liverpool and he swallowed it ?
 Yeah .
 He didn 't mention my name ?
 Let 's just say it 's forgotten .

 Just like that ?
 I had to use charm , talk him round . But yeah , he 's sweet .

 So we can go back in ?
 - Whenever we like .
 - Well done , Sean .
 - Absolutely .
 - Thank you .
 ( Woman sobs )
 So what did you say to him exactly ?
 Well ...

 - It was Ash .
 - Knew it !
 So where is he then ?

 Come on , you know him .
 He 's a proud man .
 I want an apology .
 And he wants to apologise .
 He just can 't bring himself to do it face- to- face .
 So he gave me this .
 ' A message from Ash .
 ' I 'm sorry for defacing the photograph ' of the greatest footballer who ever lived .
 Ian rush . ' guys , what a lot of people think west ham went down cos they weren 't any good but that 's not true .

 We just went into the championship for a rest , right , to take a break before we launched our next assault on the premiership . No , no .




 So should I say it or not ?
 Tell him liverpool are the best team on the planet .

 He would definitely go for that .
 When he 's gone for that and you 've shaken hands , give him a message .
 Yeah ?
 What 's that ?
 Liverpool play like a bunch of girls and west ham are the only proper team in Europe .
 ' Liverpool are the only proper team in Europe . '
 ( brilliant ! )
 ' Let 's be honest .
 West ham went down because they weren 't good enough .
 ' Liverpool are the best team on the planet .
 ' West ham play like a load of girls ' and liverpool are the only proper team in Europe . '

 so we 're good ?
 Come here .
 I pretty much told him exactly what you told me to .
 I mean , I might not have got it word for word , but you know .
 But you gave him the gist ?
 Oh , yeah .
 Yeah , yeah .
 That is a very happy lady .
 So what did you tell her ?
 I told her I was an ombudsman and she 'd just been awarded damages .
 A very sweet thing for you to do .
 Well , thank you all for your help .
 Any time .
 And the good news is , we can go back to Eddie 's . Oh ?
 Yeah , Sean did the business .
 Well , what are we waiting for ?
 Guys !
 Good to see you , come on in .
 So we 're ok ? Eh ? All forgotten , not another word .


 Bottle of bubbly on ice , waiting for you .
 On the house .
 Thank you , Eddie ! Cheers , Eddie . It 's ok .


 Oh .

 All right , ed ?
 You 're a top man , Ash , you know that ?
 It 's not easy admitting you 're wrong .
 No , no , it can 't have been .
 - Takes a big man to step up to the plate .
 - Yes , it does .
 Any chance of you letting go now ?
 Sorry .
 Look , I know you don 't like any fuss but I just want you to know , that ...
 I respect you ... As a man .
 And I respect you too , ed . As a man .
 I know you do .
 I know you do .
 So that 's it then , yeah , water under the bridge , not another word ?
 Right .
 Right .
 Right , shall we open the bottle , or ? Yes , yes .
 ( Mickey laughs ) Ok , now .
 This ... ls to a golden future .
 Bet you never thought you 'd see me again .
 Back off , corporal .
 No , we didn 't .
 Only when you were taking me into the barn , I heard you talking .
 Eddie 's isn 't the only bar in London .
 Maybe we should just find somewhere else .
 No , no , we 'll find a way to sort it .
 It was a bit of a long shot , but ...
 Tell you the truth , I thought you 'd be long gone by now .

 The thing is ... .. That half a million quid broke me and someone 's got to pay .
 So ... What do you have in mind ?
 Ash :
 Relax .
 Look , I haven 't got any beef with you guys .
 Sorry ? Ok , you got my money , but that was business . I understand that .

 I got the gold , I gave it to Heinz , I took a hit .

 You kept to your end of the bargain , I 've got no complaints about that .
 But that kraut cheated me !
 He took my gold and he gave me a dodgy cheque , now I can 't find him .
 His office number 's unavailable and some nutcase has nicked his mobile .
 50 grand .
 Now , I know you lot were black ops in the army , so I thought who better to help me out .

 Black ops ? It 's ok . I know you can 't talk about it .


 But I know how it works .
 I know what you do .
 What 's that , then ?

 You get dropped behind enemy lines to take people out .
 Well , that 's what I want you to do to the German .
 I want you to track him down for me .
 His name is Heinz Zimmerman .
 I want you to find him , and I want you to ... Take care of him for me .
 " Take care of him ? "
 You know what I mean .
 Oh , yeah .
 Take care of him .
 There 's 50 grand there , there 'll be the same again when you bring him to me .

 Or show me a photo ... Of his cold , dead body .
 Do we have a deal ?
 Let me get this straight .

 If we find this Heinz Zimmerman , take care of him , and show you a photo of that , you 'll give us another 50 thousand ?
 That 's right .
 Then you 've got a deal .

 You know where to find me .
 Did that just happen ?
 Yes , it did .
 I thought we were in trouble for a minute .
 Not to worry , I 'm on it .
 Wait a minute .
 Ugh , did you have to put ketchup on this shirt ?
 With five grand , you can buy a new shirt .

 You have to look the part .
 Or dead to be precise .
 Ok , now , that . No . Hold that , hold that .


 That 's fantastic .
 I really missed you lot , you know .
 Yeah , well , we missed you too , ed .
 Did you ? Yeah .
 Just don 't hug me again .
 Here 's to west ham .
 Oh , cheers .
 Hang on a minute , you 're supposed to say , " here 's to liverpool . "

 What for ?
 Well , that 's not very nice , is it ?
 What 's the point in apologising if you behave like that ?
 But Sean apologised , I didn 't .
 Yes , you did .
 No , I didn 't do anything .
 What about the cd ?

 What cd ?
 ' Message from Ash .
 ' I 'm sorry for defacing the photograph ' of the greatest footballer who ever lived .

 Ian rush . '
 Ash ... This ... This can be easily explained .


 How about two dead bodies for the price of one .
 Only one of 'em will be real ... .. Cos I 'm going to kill you .
 Ash .
 Sean , just run .
 Don 't just stand there !
 Help me !
 Ash , don 't make me do something I 'm going to regret !
 Argh !
 That 's pretty tight .
 That 's pretty tight ! Ash !
