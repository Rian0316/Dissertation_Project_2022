 00 : 00 : 01, 002 -- > 00 : 00 : 02, 301 Previously on " the originals " ... Klaus : I assume i have the misfortune
 Of speaking to my mother .
 I have come to heal our family .
 I will undo everything that has been done ,
 Thereby giving you a new life .
 You should get out of here .
 My brother is not the forgiving kind .
 I 'm not afraid of him .
 I 'm about to get even with klaus , And you 're gonna help me .
 You 're the alpha .
 Our people are not meant to be slaves .
 You can free them .
 [ coughs ] ollie ?
 I want you to rejoin our family , Take the body of a mortal ,
 And we can all be happy again .
 Niklaus ... you 're not real .
 I am flesh and blood , your flesh and blood .
 You are my son .
 I brought him here to be the father you never had . You said you wanted elijah .
 He 's sleeping .
 When he wakes , he 'll make his own decision .
 You cannot catch me , elijah .
 You 're getting faster , klaus , But you 're not yet fast enough .
 Ha ha !
 Klaus ? Niklaus ?
 Elijah : There you are .
 [ thunder ]
 Do you understand ?
 One day , only a monster shall remain .
 [ elijah panting ]
 Klaus :
 I know you are locked in battle .
 Klaus , voice- over : However deep in your mind
 Our mother has set the stage , hear my voice .
 Our mother thinks she will win because she has left you alone ,
 But you are not alone .
 Let me in .
 Let me help end whatever torment she has forced upon you .
 Uh !
 Ah !
 Uh !
 Oh !
 What are you doing ?
 [ panting ]
 I 'm trying to enter elijah 's thoughts to wake him .
 Esther has locked me out .
 Is this rash a side effect
 Of the witchy acid trip he 's on ?
 I haven 't seen this since i was a child .
 Mikael would return home from battle
 More blindly temperamental than usual ,
 And our mother would use the petals
 Of a rare marelok orchid to put him to sleep .
 She would mend his mind with a spell
 And then wake him with the roots of the same plant .
 If she has access to it now ,
 Then maybe it also grows in the bayou .
 You stay here with your wolves
 And mind the fort .
 I 'd rather rip your mother 's head off .
 Steer clear of her .
 I mean it , hayley .
 She already got to you once .
 What would happen if elijah were to wake
 And find you a victim of her madness ?
 I won 't go after her .
 I promise .
 I 've learned a few things from your mother .
 I won 't go after her .
 I 'll go after everything that she loves .
 [ music playing ]
 [ footsteps ]
 I 'm so sorry , jack .
 This is bull , hayley .
 Crescent tradition says you have a funeral
 At dawn , and no one is here .
 That loyalty ...
 Loyalty is gone .
 We 're standing around moping over ollie 's body
 When there 's a war to be fought .
 I understand that you have to grieve , jack .
 You waited for me .
 So i 'll do the same for you ,
 But our people need their alpha .
 [ sniffles ]
 Marcel : Where 's your alpha ?
 Unavailable .
 So you brought junior varsity ?
 I 'm getting a little tired of you
 Using my place as a den for wayward wolves .
 Oh , it 's just that we were going to take down
 Finn mikaelson today , and considering
 How he treated your vampires , i assumed that you
 Would want in on the bloodbath .
 I 'm listening .
 Well , it 's not gonna be easy .
 He 's surrounded by a pack of juiced- up wolves .
 He doesn 't have a weakness .
 He does , actually ,
 And i have her on speed dial .
 He 's got a thing for cami .
 Klaus would go ballistic if we get cami involved in this .
 Klaus ain 't here , and cami , well ,
 She 's got this thing about people telling her
 What she can and can 't do .
 Trust you , of all people , understand .
 He hasn 't called .
 He thinks he 's protecting me ,
 But i don 't think i want to be protected .
 Truth be told , i don 't think
 I want to be around him anymore at all .
 Well , that 's a nice piece of progress .
 What 's on your mind ?
 I was wondering . I ...
 I know this is , like , horribly unprofessional ,
 But i was hoping i could get a new advisor .
 You aren 't finding our sessions productive ?
 No . No . That 's not it .
 They 've been great .
 You 're really getting to know me .
 I just ...
 I want to get to know you , too .
 Uh ...
 Right . Yes . Heh .
 Mortifyingly unprofessional .
 I 'm gonna go .
 Uh , camile ...
 Do you enjoy jazz ?
 [ chanting ]
 [ glass cracking ]
 Still at it ?
 [ glass shatters ]
 I 'm trying to repair the damage that you did
 To my delinking spell .
 Oh .
 The only reason i 'm still shacked up in this dump motel
 With you is for your freaky witch encyclopedia brain . Ok .
 Well , here 's a magical secret
 From the ancient legends of the romani psychics ...
 Sleep , davina .
 You 've been awake for days .
 Kind of hard to rest
 With a 1, 000- year- old psycho in the next bed .
 When you say that , i sound
 Like a bit of a creeper .
 Can you just stop ?
 Stop what , darling .
 Calling me darling and trying to be funny
 And ... All of that .
 Oh , well , most girls like this , but then
 You 're not like most girls , are you ?
 What i 'd like is for you to just stop messing around .
 Ok , davina . All right .
 I have been trying to charm you ,
 And your resistance is as impressive
 As it is baffling , but there are things
 That we can do , big things .
 I can 't share my secrets with you
 Unless we trust each other .
 I don 't care about your secrets , kaleb ... Kol .
 I don 't even know what to call you .
 Kol mikaelson ,
 And if you want to take down klaus
 Without your friends dying , well ,
 Then you 'd be a fool not to listen to me .
 Uh !
 Ooh ...
 Uh ... What 's happening ?
 That 's mother dearest calling me home .
 [ panting ]
 Well , you always did know how
 To leave a message , mother .
 If only all my sons were as respectful as you are .
 Kol will return home soon .
 Elijah will wake from his slumber believing
 The only way to salvage his humanity
 Is to rejoin our family , which is why
 It is time you bring camile in .
 Here . I 've spelled this to subdue her
 Without causing bodily harm .
 I thought we had more time .
 We don 't .
 Once klaus has been duly influenced
 By his father , we will need to act quickly .
 No . There 's no need for this .
 I can bring her in without it .
 Stop following me .
 I have no intention of taking esther 's bargain
 And no desire to be remade a mortal being .
 Now kindly piss off .
 I 'm in a hurry to help my real family .
 You seek the marelok orchid .
 How did you know that ?
 I saw you carry elijah home last night .
 Who do you think used to find the orchid
 For your mother to put mikael to sleep ?
 Without my help , you could search forever .
 My mother brought you back from the dead .
 My sense of strategy tells me it wasn 't
 To play a father- son game of hide- and- seek .
 You can storm off in a fit
 Of stubbornness if you like ,
 But i suggest you do so toward the west .
 [ classical music playing ]
 [ blues music playing ]
 [ music stops ] Ha ha !
 You have any fun with magic , or is it all
 Just angst and child sacrifice with you lot ?
 You were a witch before you were
 A vampire , right ? Yeah .
 None of my siblings have tapped into their power ,
 Little bit of a child prodigy .
 I loved it . I loved the power .
 I loved the rush ,
 And then when we turned , i lost it all ,
 Went through a bit of a dark period .
 1, 000 years ? Yeah .
 Well , i 'm a thrill seeker .
 Couldn 't get that from magic anymore ,
 So i looked elsewhere .
 Murder , mayhem .
 Youthful misadventures .
 I actually spent quite a lot of time with witches ,
 Learning from them , teaching them ,
 Trying to get back what my mother stole from me .
 Is that why she brought you back as a witch ?
 She felt like this body
 Would be the best for the task at hand ...
 Spying on the prettiest witch in town .
 Can 't believe your mom sent you here
 To flirt with me .
 No , no . She sent me to follow you .
 The flirting bit was me .
 [ classical music playing ]
 Cami said vincent wants to meet at preservation hall ,
 But he won 't be unprotected .
 There 'll be wolves positioned here and here .
 Can we keep this alley open ?
 Great . We 'll wait there
 And rip vincent 's head off .
 Nah . He 'll body jump .
 His head stays on .
 He 'll have a hard time answering our questions
 Without it .
 Sweet . It 's a big box of dusty , old junk . We 're saved .
 They 're dark objects my uncle left for me .
 I 've been cataloging them according to kieran 's notes .
 As far as i can tell , these can be used
 Against witches specifically .
 Kinky .
 I remember these . What ?
 100 years ago , the human faction
 Waged a war against the voodoo queens .
 They had a trader spell these manacles .
 You slap them on a witch ,
 They can 't do magic as long as they 're on .
 All right .
 Well , we 're not gonna get the handcuffs of doom on him
 While he 's surrounded by a werewolf entourage .
 We just lure him away . I can do that .
 Cami , if we do this , you 're the bait .
 Are you sure you 're ok with that ?
 Make it look convincing .
 The guy is really smart .
 Ansel : 1, 000 years estranged ,
 And you choose to walk in silence .
 Surely , you have questions for me .
 Just one .
 Is there a way to cure elijah
 Without having to listen to the pointless
 Ramblings of an old man ?
 I 'm afraid the price of my expertise
 Is conversation .
 You know , i used to tell myself that
 My real father must have had no idea i existed .
 Otherwise , he 'd never leave me to suffer under mikael .
 Esther forbade me from seeing you .
 So i waited , knowing that one day ,
 You would trigger your curse
 And need your real father ...
 But when that happened , mikael found me first .
 I fought him for you .
 Yes . Well , your grand declaration is just a few years too late .
 Now , you joke , but i know you 've
 Always felt a void in your life .
 I 've watched you from beyond for centuries .
 You 've traveled all corners of the world ,
 Seen monuments erected , feasted on the blood
 Of history 's most extraordinary men ,
 But you 've never found true peace .
 The only moments of joy in your life ,
 However fleeting , have been simple pleasures ...
 As you climbed the himalayas ,
 As you tended to your horses ,
 Quiet days teaching that boy shakespeare .
 Stop . I watched you paint .
 I watched you feel your unborn daughter 's kick .
 I said stop .
 A millennium of observing me ,
 Were your eyes closed as i slaughtered whole villages ,
 Fed my way through thousands of innocents ?
 Because ... let 's face it ...
 I have a tendency to play with my food .
 Have i made you proud , father ?
 Remind me to teach you how to send a text message .
 You were told to get the white oak stake days ago .
 We need it now ,
 Seeing as your father has risen .
 Mikael ?
 Back from the dead ?
 Enough . You kept it from me .
 Why , because of davina claire ?
 To protect your plan .
 She 's never gonna trust me if she thinks i 'm just
 A flying monkey to the wicked witch .
 I 've got it handled , mother .
 I want that stake , and i don 't care
 What you have to do to get it .
 Vervain . It 's everywhere .
 My relentless mother has set a trap .
 I 'll retrieve the marelok for you .
 At what cost ?
 Why don 't you use your vampire abilities
 To end your doubts ?
 Search my mind .
 You 'll see i 'm not allied with your mother .
 I have absolutely no interest
 In the inner workings of your brain .
 I 'm surprised at your cowardice .
 While you stand here in fear of me ,
 Your brother suffers further .
 Gather the orchids .
 What 'd your mother want from you ?
 She wants me to take that stake
 Out of your bag , give it to her
 So that you can 't kill klaus
 Before she gets her big , happy family .
 Is that why you called me here ?
 I 'm not my mother 's puppet .
 I want something different entirely .
 I want your blood . Relax , luv .
 I 'm not gonna take it . I 'm asking you nicely . Sure .
 I 'll just bleed for you
 Without any explanation at all .
 About 100 years ago ,
 This tomb used to be my playhouse .
 The witches i used to run with ,
 They used to make all kinds of magic in here ,
 That is , until i pissed the prettiest one off ,
 As i tend to do , and , well , she locked me out .
 So why do you need my blood ?
 Her name was mary- alice claire .
 Only a claire witch can open this tomb .
 Where 'd you get all this stuff ?
 Well , i was a vampire .
 I could get anything i wanted ,
 But i couldn 't practice witchcraft .
 So i charmed some witches , and i taught them
 A new kind of magic that i learned in arabia
 Called kemiya .
 We made items that allowed me to use magic
 Without doing magic .
 You taught them how to make dark objects .
 Yeah , and for a time ,
 They were scattered all around the city .
 I can 't for the life of me find out
 Where they are now , but ...
 I 've got the one that matters .
 What is it ?
 It 's not about what it is .
 It 's about what it could be .
 You want to take down klaus , right ?
 I 've wanted one thing for years ...
 To drive a dagger into his heart
 Like he 's done to me so many times .
 Those daggers don 't work on klaus .
 Smart girl .
 With a little practice and some trust ,
 We 'll fix it so this one will .
 We 'll put him in a box .
 Seeing as he won 't be entirely dead ,
 Your friends will be safe .
 So what do you say ?
 [ dixieland jazz music playing ] [ bell rings ]
 Thank you . This is amazing .
 I developed an appreciation
 For the music when i moved here .
 I never had a taste for it before .
 I see you 're still developing
 Your taste for beer .
 My mom said beer wasn 't ladylike .
 So i learned to love it as an act of rebellion .
 What about you ?
 Snobby mom , distant dad ? Let 's go .
 Well , my mother and i are quite close .
 She made so many sacrifices for us ,
 Now anything she asks seem negligible in comparison .
 [ cell phone rings ] Oh . Hold on .
 So sorry .
 Can you hold this ?
 Oh , i have to take this .
 A friend is covering my shift .
 I 'll be right back . I 'm so sorry .
 Cami :
 Aah !
 Aah !
 Aah !
 Aah !
 Aah !
 Hey !
 [ hayley whistles ]
 Klaus :
 I 've always seen a blade to have a very different use .
 Mikael taught you to kill , klaus ,
 But you were born to create .
 Power lies in embracing your true nature .
 You think i should accept my mother 's offer ,
 Sacrifice my vampirism .
 Then what , become a florist ?
 [ chuckles ]
 You wouldn 't be sacrificing anything .
 As a wolf , you could be king
 To an entire species .
 You would feel true peace .
 You would be a better father .
 I am no longer a father .
 In our animal form ,
 We feel everything more acutely .
 When you were a boy , after each full moon ,
 I would wake closer to your village ,
 Having been drawn to you in the night .
 Since i 've been back , each month when i turn ,
 I wake further from new orleans .
 I know the call of my own blood , klaus .
 I know your child is still alive .
 It was a wolf bite . Who broke rank ?
 I 'll knock some heads together and find out .
 I 'll know where camile is shortly .
 You 'll meet me there .
 Come alone
 Because your wolves can 't be trusted .
 [ beep ]
 [ beep ] Well , he bought it .
 His locator spell will bring him here
 Without the bodyguards .
 I always thought having a woman 's mouth
 On my neck would be more erotic .
 You 'll heal fast .
 Let 's get all these lights off .
 Here .
 We 're so going to hell for this .
 Ha ha ! Yeah . You get used to it .
 Hey , i know this probably isn 't your ideal friday night .
 I 'm sure you 'd rather be , like , doing pushups
 Or drinking beers with your bros or whatever .
 Eh , it 's not so bad .
 Cami : Ok . Tell me the plan one more time .
 Aiden is gonna get vincent to the altar ,
 And then i 'm gonna jump him .
 He 's powerful , though , so we only have
 A few seconds to get the shackles on him .
 Where 's marcel ?
 He 's looking for davina .
 He heard she was back in town .
 Overprotective dad stuff .
 If you want to call ripping kol mikaelson
 Into 1, 000 little pieces protective dad stuff ,
 Then , yeah , that 's it .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ snap ]
 [ music playing ]
 Kaleb :
 The hunters who forged the originals daggers
 To take out my family didn 't know that klaus
 Was part werewolf and vulnerable to silver .
 Now , it 's impossible to replicate
 The spell cast on the dagger ...
 Trust me , i 've tried ... but it 's not impossible
 To change the dagger itself .
 Now , kemiya allows witches to destroy
 One element to create another ,
 Say , changing silver to gold , for example .
 So you 've been hanging out with me this whole time
 Because you don 't have enough power on your own .
 Oh , kemiya is about chemistry .
 It 's about connection , and after what happened
 With the white oak stake ,
 I don 't think you could deny what we have .
 So , here , hold my hand .
 That 's a giant diamond .
 It 's a paragon diamond .
 They use them to conduct power .
 Is the hand holding really necessary ?
 I mean , we could make out ,
 But would that not be entirely distracting ?
 [ sighs ]
 All right . Follow my lead .
 Close your eyes .
 [ chanting ]
 [ both chanting ]
 Heh .
 [ gasps ]
 To replace the one i broke .
 We changed it .
 Oh , davina claire ,
 We 're gonna change everything .
 This will help elijah .
 Ansel ...
 I 'd be lying if i said your offer wasn 't appealing .
 I 've never known a parent to be a benevolent force .
 I think i would have liked to have been your son ,
 But a different path was chosen for me ,
 And i have for the past 1, 000 years
 Been son of mikael ... paranoid , vengeful ...
 And powerful enough to protect my daughter .
 I want to help you defend her .
 I believe you ,
 But love is what esther twists .
 She will take the best of your intentions ,
 And she will use them to get to my little girl .
 You waited too long
 Before you came to rescue me .
 I won 't make the same mistake with hope .
 No .
 No , klaus .
 I know you .
 You are not capable of this .
 That 's the first lie you 've told me .
 Uh !
 Oh ...
 It 's late . I should get going .
 Suppose you 'll be wanting
 To get back to marcel 's .
 I lied to him about you .
 Probably go back to the attic .
 Voluntarily returning to the jail cell
 Where they locked you up .
 You must have been lonely all that time .
 A witch needs a coven , even if it is just two .
 When can we work on the dagger ?
 Soon . We got some more work to do
 With each other first .
 You 're gonna like me , davina claire ,
 And i 'm gonna let you pretend a while
 That you don 't already .
 Well , i staked it out .
 Looks like a couple of oliver 's friends
 Wanting to avenge his death .
 Where 's cami ?
 She 's tied up near the altar .
 Hey , you know what ? You beeline for her .
 I 'll handle the rest of them , all right ?
 Aiden , your brother
 Was among the recruits that oliver rescued .
 Was he not ?
 [ thunder ]
 Oh , no .
 [ crack ]
 Camile ! Camile !
 First , i 'm gonna kick your ass ,
 And then i 'm gonna take my pack back .
 Your pack ?
 Last i checked , your pack
 Was blindly following me .
 Want to talk about following ?
 How do your mother 's boots taste , huh ?
 Ha ! What have you done with cami ?
 Oh ! Hybrids die by losing their head
 Or their heart .
 Given the choice , i 'm gonna take the organ
 That got you into this mess in the first place .
 [ chanting ]
 [ gagging ]
 Aagh !
 Huh !
 Aagh !
 [ clank clank ]
 [ sobs ]
 You would 've done the same thing to me , finn .
 [ chains rattle ] Hey , are you ok ?
 I 'm so sorry i made you wait .
 Your timing was pretty awesome , actually .
 Ha ha !
 [ elijah panting ]
 We were innocent once , elijah .
 We were innocent once , elijah .
 [ panting ]
 [ thunder ]
 This bloodlust was forced upon us
 By our parents ,
 Turning us from prey to predator .
 [ thunder ]
 We are the demons lurking in shadow .
 We are the savage villains
 In fairy tales told to children ,
 But not for my child , not for hope .
 In her story ,
 We are the knights in shining armor .
 Without you by my side , i don 't think i can
 Survive my own love for my daughter .
 I need you .
 I need you , brother .
 The monster in me can only be checked
 By the monster in you ,
 By the monster in you .
 Only together can we defeat our demons
 And save our family .
 [ thunder ]
 Hraagh !
 [ panting ]
 [ door opens and closes ]
 We put vincent in the back of josh 's car .
 Is aiden all right ?
 Mm , some ice and bourbon , he 'll be fine .
 How 'd you know where to find us ?
 I spent a lot of time tracking you when i was a wolf .
 Call it animal instinct .
 What do you mean ?
 Oh , ollie used to give me so much hell
 For waiting on you .
 Oh , girls came and went , but i always knew
 Someday you 'd come .
 See , our parents had been so sure
 That you and i could change things for the better .
 Jack , i think the girl that you were waiting on
 Was andrea labonair , mythic revolutionary .
 You got hayley marshall ,
 A knocked- up tomboy with a bad attitude .
 You got dealt a crappy hand .
 [ chuckles ] No . You 're right .
 You 're not the girl i waited for .
 You 're better .
 What is it ?
 I spent the day with my father ,
 My real father .
 Esther brought him back from the dead
 Believing he could convince me
 To renounce vampirism ,
 And the thought of what i could be
 Had i been raised by him ...
 I 'd have been nurtured .
 This was his .
 He knew about hope ...
 And i wanted to trust him .
 More than anything in the world , i wanted to ,
 But ...
 Uh ... I couldn 't be sure ,
 And i would never forgive myself
 If something happened to her
 Because of my selfish desire for a father .
 So i killed him .
 Without hesitation , i killed him .
 [ music playing ]
 You killed him for hope .
 Whatever innocence remains
 We must protect at any cost .
 [ sobs ]
 [ sobbing ]
 Yaah !
 Oh ...
 Sorry . We 're closed .
 That 's too bad .
 I hear you serve the best sazerac in town .
 Camile , isn 't it ?
 My sons have taken quite the liking to you .
 [ chanting ]
 How do you feel ?
 The worst has passed ...
 Though i suspect the nightmares
 Are far from over .
 Well , gather your strength .
 After the message i sent mother tonight ,
 I expect hellfire to rain down upon us imminently .
 We need to make a move before she strikes . Marcel :
 Actually , moves were made while you were sleeping .
 It 's good to see you vertical .
 Marcel and i each left a gift for you in the ballroom .
 You 're welcome .
 Kaleb : Kidnapping .
 It 's a rather unpleasant way to begin a family reunion .
 Well , wait until you see how we end it .
