 00 : 00 : 06, 560 -- > 00 : 00 : 07, 760 Howard Wolowitz . Hey , Howard .
 Dave Roeger here at NASA .
 We need to talk about your upcoming mission .
 Yes , yes , I 've been doing my push- ups .
 I 'm still stuck at nine , but ... ... that 's going all the way down with no one holding me .
 That 's great , uh , but that 's not why I called . We 've run into a bit of a snafu .
 Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test , so bottom line , mission 's been scrubbed .
 You 're kidding .
 So what does that mean ?
 Uh- huh .
 Uh- huh .
 Boy , I got to tell you , I 'm really disappointed .
 This was my dream ever since I was a little kid .
 Okay , well , uh , thanks for the call .
 Yep , you , too .
 Yes !
 Thank you !
 Oh !
 Oh ...
 I 'm not gonna die in space !
 I 'm gonna die the way God intended , in my late 50s , with a heart full of pastrami .

 Original Air Date on May 3 , 2012
 I 'm going to need a larger shirt .
 This one 's a little tight under the arms .
 Okay .
 Do you think maybe it 's tight because you 're wearing long underwear ?
 Yes , of course that 's why it 's tight .
 All right , let me rephrase the question .
 Why are you wearing long underwear ?
 You 're kidding .
 Shouldn 't the question be : why you ?
 No , it should be : why are you ?
 ( sighs ) Leonard , these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers .
 I don 't like my own sweat touching my skin , how do you think I feel about theirs ?
 Why don 't you slip this on ?
 Said the hangman offering a noose .
 Well , that wasn 't as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes , but it was right up there .
 Well , that 's it .
 My orders have been rescinded .
 I am officially " no go " to space .
 I 'm sorry , Howard , but I got to tell you ,
 I 'm a little relieved you 're not going .
 Why ?
 Come on , you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians .
 Yeah , so ?
 When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say , " Ooh , check out this Blu- ray player , it must be good , it was built in Russia " ?
 Well , their technology isn 't that bad .
 When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule , you free- fall from space at 500 miles per hour , and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground .


 And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture
 Rocky and Bullwinkle .
 All right , well , whatever .
 I wasn 't worried .
 You weren 't ?
 Let me explain the difference between you and me .
 You watch
 I live it .
 I don 't remember the episode of where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store . Oh , please .



 Make all the jokes you want , but there 's only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did .
 Ah , much better .
 You must be burning up .
 A little .
 But not more than your urethras will be after whatever 's in those pants swims up them .
 Well ... I cut quite the dashing , yet hygienic figure , don 't I ?
 I look like the Flash about to get married .
 Oh !
 A tissue !
 A tissue !
 Oh , good Lord !
 Uh , where 's he going ?
 He keeps emergency Purell in the car .
 Keys !
 Keys !
 Keys !
 Before I come in , you should know , I have gas . Hey , you .


 For the record , not your worst opening line .
 Check it out .
 It 's the gas I use in my free- electron laser to support high voltages .
 it also has an interesting secondary use .
 Here .
 Breathe this in .
 B- Before I do it , if you 're a cop you have tell me , right ?
 Just try it .
 Okay .
 What 's it supposed to ...
 Oh , my God , that 's so freaky !
 ♪ You 're a mean one ♪ ♪ Mr. Grinch . ♪


 Okay .
 Me , me , me .
 Ready ?
 Leonard , I am your father .
 I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life .
 Oh ...
 Mm .
 Hey ... you know how we 've been ... taking things slow ?
 Mm- hmm .
 Well , I 've been thinking , and ... maybe I 'm ready to ... take things a little ... faster .
 Oh ... great .
 Mm- hmm .
 And I promise , after waiting four months , fast is what you 're gonna get .
 You know , just- just one thing .
 Look , we 're in a really great place right now , and I don 't want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again .
 So we won 't let it get weird .
 Oh , and just a heads- up ... mm , since the last time you saw me naked , Okay .

 I got a Cookie Monster tattoo .

 The acceptable responses when you see it are " awesome " or nothing .
 What about ...
 Cookies !
 Amy ?
 Amy ?
 Amy ?
 7 : 00 , right on time .
 It 's not an accident .
 I waited outside your door for 20 minutes .
 Well , dinner 's almost ready .
 I must say ,
 I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment .
 As I mentioned , the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times , and later , the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale .
 You ask anyone , that 's a hot date .
 Tempting choices , but I have something special planned for tonight .
 What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones ?
 With our friends moving forward in their relationships ,
 I 've decided that we should make progress in ours as well .
 Oh , dear Lord .
 Two years ago , we didn 't even know each other , and now I 'm in your apartment after dark .
 How much faster can this thing go ?
 I had a feeling you 'd be reluctant , which is why I 'm going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks .
 Oh , you brain monkeys kill me .
 Dip away .
 I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame .
 And how do you propose to do that ?
 Uh , hope you 're not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control .
 Because there 's only one mind- expanding drug that this man enjoys , and that 's called school .
 Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up .
 In your case , to your mother , superheroes , et cetera .
 I 'm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me .
 Well , seems what 's on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock .
 We 'll see . Let 's start with a little romantic dinner music , shall we ?
 Super Mario Bros. theme ?
 Yes . I see what you 're doing .
 You 're attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game -- admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood ... ... but it won 't work .




 Fine .
 There 's no reason we still can 't have a lovely dinner .
 Why don 't you have a seat .
 Boink !
 Boink !
 May I offer you something to drink ?
 You know I don 't drink .
 Not even ... strawberry Quik ?
 I love strawberry Quik .
 It 's my favorite pink fluid , narrowly beating out Pepto- Bismol .
 Oh , I know .
 I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared ... for dinner .
 Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it !
 Just like your mommy used to make .
 Oh ... yummy , yummy !
 We should do this more often .
 Uh- oh .
 I 'm sorry .
 I did , I crossed a line .
 I didn 't mean to !
 Who says something like that right in the middle of sex ? !
 I don 't know , it just came out .
 People say weird things during sex all the time .
 Okay , well , they sure as hell don 't say that .
 It was the heat of the moment .
 No , the heat of the moment is , " Ooh , yeah , just like that , " not " will you marry me ? "
 I 'm sorry .
 Just- just give me another chance .
 Why , so you can crawl under the covers and go ,
 " Hey , baby , want to go look for houses in neighborhoods with good schools ? "
 Again , I 'm sorry .
 You know , with Howard and Bernadette getting married ,
 I got caught up in a little wedding fever .
 I take it back . You can 't take something like that back .
 I mean , what are we even supposed to do now ?
 Okay , at some point , we 'll look back and this is going to be a funny story .
 Why don 't we just start doing that now ?
 You 're kidding .
 No .
 Hey , do you remember ... ... that time when I proposed to you in bed ?
 And you were all , like , " What are doing ? "
 That was so funny .
 So funny .
 It 's not funny .
 Give it a minute .
 Is that a little smile I see there ?
 I should go .
 Hey , I was thinking .
 For our first dance at the wedding , what if we learn the final number from
 You 're kidding .
 No , come on .
 How cool would that be ?
 Me running into your arms ... you lifting me up into the air .
 Oh , you 're in a good mood .
 Yeah , well , why wouldn 't I be ?
 You know , I 'm marrying the girl of my dreams , and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon .
 Oh , hang on .
 Oh , it 's NASA .
 Wolowitz .
 Oh ! Hi , Dave .
 What 's up ?
 No kidding .
 Really ?
 Well , that 's ... great news .
 Great , great news .
 All right , I 'll watch my e- mail for the details .
 Okay , talk soon .
 What 's so great ?
 It looks like I 'm going into space after all .
 Oh , Howie , that 's wonderful !
 Uh- huh , wonderful .
 Yay ...
 What happened ?
 I thought they canceled your mission .
 Th- They did . But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station , so they 're putting me on an earlier launch .

 When ?
 A ... week from Friday .
 What ? We 're getting married that Sunday .
 You 're right !
 I- I can 't go to space .
 I have to get married , and no one can say that 's not a good reason .
 I 'll call him back .
 Wait .
 I don 't want to be the one who stands in your way .
 Well , too bad , you already did .
 It 's a done deal .
 Oh , well .
 But I forgive you .
 That 's not how I want to start our marriage , killing your dream ?
 No .
 We 'll have the wedding when you get back .
 But wh- what about all the plans and the guests ?
 We 'll call them .
 Although my dad 's gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits .
 You 're right , he is !
 Your dad 's gonna be furious .
 There 's no way he 's gonna let us postpone this wedding .
 Well , we tried .
 I 'll talk to him .
 He won 't say no to his little girl .
 No ! I- I should talk to him , man to man .

 But , Howie , my dad can be a bully .
 He 's gonna make you cancel your space flight .
 We can only hope ... that he doesn 't .
 Bishop to queen four ,
 level two . Check .
 Sheldon ... knight takes bishop .
 You all right ?
 I 'm fine .
 Are you ?
 You left your queen exposed from above , you trapped your knight in the corner , and you keep sighing and saying , " Why me ? "
 Very well .
 Can I ask you a question about women ?
 We got you that book last year .
 Wasn 't everything in there ? No , I 'm having a relationship problem with Amy .
 And by the way , that book gave me nightmares .
 Well , if it makes you feel any better ,
 I screwed things up pretty good with Penny .
 Look at us , Leonard ... engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol ' ladies .
 I guess we are .
 So , what 's going on ?
 Believe it or not ,
 Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy .
 I 'm sorry , that must be very difficult for you .
 It 's awful .
 This morning , she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day .
 It- It 's usually only open to children .
 She got them to make an exception .
 Shame on her . They let me blow the whistle , Leonard .
 She 's good .
 I know .
 it gets worse .
 Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times .
 You mean , like in bed or in the shower ?
 No ! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book ?
 For example , this morning ,
 I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum , when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy 's dandruff ...

 ... gently cascading down onto her pale , slightly hunched shoulders .
 What has that vixen done to me , Leonard ?
 And how do I make it stop ? Well , if you had a physical relationship ,
 I 'd say propose during sex .
 Turns out that 's a real mood killer .
 I assume we 're talking about you now ?
 Yeah .
 So , that 's how this works ?
 I complain , and then you complain , and no one offers any solutions ?
 Pretty much .
 Well , no wonder the women are winning .
 Mr. Rostenkowski , are you busy ?
 Oh , just looking at some old pictures .
 Come on in .
 Family pictures , or ... ?
 H- Holy crap , that 's a dead person .
 Last murder case before I retired . How many bodies do you see there ?
 Careful , it 's a trick question .
 I 'm not sure .
 Nah , you 'll never get it .
 It 's a fraction . How about that .
 Anyway , sir , I need to talk to you about something .

 Walnut ? No , thank you .
 I 'm allergic .
 Oh , sure .
 My partner used to have that .
 He 's dead now .
 From nuts ?
 Nah , his wife shot him .
 But she was nuts , so in a way ...
 Nice story .
 Anyway , the reason I wanted to talk to you is
 NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station .
 Yeah , so ?
 So ... the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter .
 Now , I know what you 're going to say -- I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I 've got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing .
 Well , message heard and understood .
 Mission canceled .
 Thank you .
 Where are you going ?
 I 'm sorry .
 May I be excused ?
 No , you may not .
 Let me tell you something .
 When I first met you ...
 You just gonna stand there ?
 I 'm sorry , I didn 't know , is this going to ...
 Well , I should sit ...
 May I be seat ...
 Well , I 'll just sit .
 When I first met you ,
 I didn 't like you .
 I 'm aware of that , sir .
 But then you and I had some time together .
 Uh- huh . It did not get better .
 Right , right .
 That silly Beatle haircut and ... you riding around on a red Vespa , and you 're still living at home with your mother .
 To be honest , I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me .
 But then I heard about your astronaut thing , and I realized
 I judged you too fast .
 Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl .
 Oh , I am .
 And just so you know , I 'd still be an astronaut , even if I didn 't go to space .
 I 've got an I. D. card and a NASA golf shirt .
 No , no , you got to go . You can 't turn down an opportunity like this .
 B- But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception ?
 You let me worry about that .
 You go up to that space station , and you make me proud .
 Um , okay .
 You got a problem with that ?
 All right , look , I 'm gonna level with you .
 I 'm terrified about going into space .
 What if I don 't make it back ?
 It 's gonna be okay , son .
 You really think so ?
 Of course .
 A pretty girl like Bernadette ... she 'll find a new guy .
 Hey .
 Hey .
 Off to work ? Yeah .
 Have a nice night .
 Okay , you , too .
 Penny , just , wait .
 I 've been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night .
 Yeah , I 've been thinking about it , too .
 I noticed you never answered me .
 You 're right .
 No .

 Uh , follow- up .
 Are we still dating ? Yep .
 Is it still weird ' cause I proposed ?
 Yep .
 I have a couple more quick questions .
 Do you want to call me from the car ?
 No !
 Think I played that pretty well .

 Hello , Leonard .
 What are you doing ?
 We 're playing doctor .
 style .
 I 'm in hell , Leonard .
 Don 't stop .
