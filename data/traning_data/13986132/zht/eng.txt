 ' Candita , I will love you until my dying day .
 Marry me ! ' "
 " But Candita didn 't wanna be owned by some rich , alien dude . "
 " So she said , ' I don 't love you , Lord Vanon , but I do want to have sex with you . ' "
 " Lord Vanon agreed to have sex with Candita and showed her his penis hands for the first time . "
 " She was repulsed , but she liked it . "

 - What 's with the cape , Lily ?
 It 's my nebula protector , obviously .
 Lily wrote another story .
 Sarah , why don 't you go and chat with the other girls ?
 I 'm going to have to confiscate this .
 And I need to speak to your parents .
 [ song continues ]
 Lily Pad ,
 Miss Talbot called . She was really upset .
 She said you 'd written a story .
 Something about hands looking like ...
 Penises ?
 She asked if everything was all right at home . It was embarrassing .
 The thing is , nice girls don 't really talk about all that
 S- E- X stuff .
 You know , it 's ... it 's just not really appropriate .
 I like writing stories .
 Well , maybe keep 'em to yourself . ...

 Mum ?
 Yeah ?
 Aimee 's here for her appointment .
 Oh shit . I completely forgot .
 - All right , I 'll be right down .
 - Okay .
 [ sighs ]
 [ exhales ]
 [ Aimee ]
 So this one has a longer labia , which is really common .
 This one 's all tucked in .
 With pubes , without pubes .
 This one 's more frilly .
 This one 's crooked , like mine , and this one , as you can see , is on its period .
 - I 'll go for the one with pubes . - Great choice !
 - Thank you . - Sorry , Aimee .
 I 'm a bit disorganized this morning .
 - Morning ! - Morning .
 - Vulva cupcake ?
 - [ Jean ]
 Ah .
 [ whimsical music continues ]
 Yeah .
 Thanks .
 [ sighs ]
 They must have had a fight .
 Wow .
 Look at all those tits .
 Yeah , I 'm reorganizing my vintage men 's magazine collection .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 Those are my favorites .
 Oh , they 're lovely .
 Anyway , how you doing today , Aimee ?
 Well ,
 I had a big fight with my best friend , Maeve , and I 'm feeling really sad about it .
 But also like I wanna punch her in the face .
 Why don 't we talk about it ?
 You seem quiet .
 I 'm just a bit tired .
 [ phone chimes ]
 [ emotional music playing ]
 What is it ?
 I just got into the Gifted & Talented program .
 - [ chuckles ] - I can 't believe it !
 I can .
 I knew you 'd get it .
 [ phone chimes ]

 - Hey , that 's amazing ! - Thank you .
 Try to enjoy it .
 Otherwise , I will have to tell a joke .
 Please don 't .
 - Knock , knock ... - No . Okay , I 'm going to school .
 I 'll see you later .

 My friends will be jealous of these gifts .
 Abeo is so generous .
 Me , I 'm always boasting about my son- in- law .
 The successful accountant in England .
 [ laughs ]
 What is she on about ? Dad 's not an accountant .
 I don 't know .
 I 'll get you some more .
 Ah- ah .
 Don 't worry , Mummy . I will get it .
 No , now it 's not often I get to wait on my grandson .
 - Oh !
 - [ speaking Yoruba ]
 - Hey !
 - Hey , my sister !
 Bebe . Emeka .
 [ tuts ]
 Hm .
 - He 's going to be at the wedding .
 - I haven 't seen him for years .
 - [ Beryl ] His business is doing so well ! - Who 's Emeka ?
 - I don 't know who he is . - And he 's still single , you know .
 - Stop gossiping , Beryl !
 - [ grandma laughs ]
 - Who 's Emeka ? - No one !
 Eh ?
 You were engaged !
 - Engaged ? - [ Beatrice ] Okay , girls .
 Time to start getting ready for the wedding !
 [ speaking Yoruba ]
 - Mm- hmm .
 - Hey ! Go !
 [ Beryl laughs ]
 - Grandma !
 - Yes .
 [ Aimee ]
 She said I was being unfair to Steve because I 'm too much of a people pleaser to break up with him .
 [ Aimee breathes deeply ]
 And how did that make you feel ?
 Like an idiot .
 Because she 's probably right .
 She didn 't have to say it in such a mean way .
 Why do you think she 's right ?
 ' Cause it 's true .
 I hate fights . I hate making people feel bad .
 So I just lie and tell them what they wanna hear , which is why I probably won 't break up with Steve , and why I had such awful friends for so many years .
 And why I smiled at that gross , stupid man on the bus and made him think he could rub his stupid dick on me .
 [ Aimee breathes deeply ] [ breathes deeply ]
 [ exhales ]
 Do you feel that if you hadn 't smiled at him , he wouldn 't have assaulted you ?
 I don 't know .
 Had you smiled at strangers before ?
 Had that led to them assaulting you ?
 Listen to me , Aimee .
 What that man did to you on the bus has nothing to do with your smile or your personality and is only about him .

 And it is absolutely not your fault .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Do you understand ?
 Okay .
 How do I get stronger ?
 Like you .
 Like Maeve .
 Oh , I bet you 're stronger than you think you are .
 The fact that you can say you feel angry because of the fight with Maeve , that 's a positive step towards feeling your full spectrum of emotions .
 But also , it 's not anybody 's place to tell you that you should or shouldn 't break up with your boyfriend .
 Yeah , I guess so .
 I mean , I did tell her to get over herself and be with Otis , but I think I have a point .
 They 're clearly in love .
 Yes , he 's been a bit of an arsehole , but he 's apologized a lot .
 And she isn 't the easiest person to get to know , so it 's kinda like ... [ whimsical music playing ]
 I probably shouldn 't have talked about Otis , should I ?
 How was he an arsehole ?
 Oh .
 Well , see you next time , Aimee .
 Thank you .
 - Oh , Aimee , can I grab a lift ? - [ Aimee ]
 Yeah ! - [ phone chimes ]

 Okay . And why did you not get married ?
 I met your father .
 - Okay , you met my father in the war ... - You look lovely .

 The musical was weird , but she 's actually into banging aliens !
 Hey , Lil , can we please talk ?
 What 's going on ? They published my story .
 Oh my God .
 Hope , um , I was wondering if I could talk to you about getting a gender- neutral changing room on campus ?
 I think it would really help the trans and queer students here .
 Cal , we can talk about whatever you like once you come to school wearing the correct uniform .
 How exactly would you define " correct " ?
 Layla , could you come here , please ?
 Layla is a perfect example of how you can express your identity and still abide by school rules .
 So Layla 's a good NB , and I 'm a bad one . Is that right ?
 [ inhales ]
 I don 't understand your slang .
 N- B.
 Like , nonbinary person .
 Layla , you can step back .
 Thank you .
 I think it 's interesting how you like to split us up .
 Layla and me , Jackson and Viv .
 Is there too much power in multiple otherness for you ?
 Like I said , come to me when you 're sticking to protocol .
 Can you believe Adam Groff threw poo out of the coach window ?
 I always knew he was deranged .
 [ gasps ] Oh my God , Mark !
 [ chuckles ] You scared me .
 Why are we in the paper again ?
 And why have I been fielding complaints from parents telling me their children went on a school trip which involved missing students and human feces ?
 - I 'll look into it .
 - Hm .
 I told our investors and the rest of the school board that you were going to turn the narrative around .
 Yes .
 And our upcoming open day will nip this in the bud .
 We 'll be announcing the rebrand to the press ...
 [ Mark ] A rebrand isn 't enough .
 You need to show them that this place has changed .
 If we don 't get the next round of money , we are screwed . Do you understand ?
 Yes . I will not let you down .
 Good . I 've got a meeting to get to .
 Of course .
 Of course you do .
 Thank you .
 Thank you so much for that encouraging pep talk .
 So supportive .

 - Gentle .

 - Hi . - Sorry , I can come back ...
 No , absolutely not .
 Um , how can I help you ?
 Um , okay , so I got onto the GTlP . - Oh .
 Well done .
 - Um ...
 So I was wondering if you 'd managed to get that funding we talked about .
 - I spoke to the school board .
 - Mm- hmm .
 And unfortunately , things are a bit tight at the moment .
 And so , they said no .
 [ inhales deeply ]
 Yeah .
 I 'm so sorry , Maeve .
 No , it 's fine .

 - Good .

 That 's amazing ! Oh , congrats , Maeve .
 Thanks . Don 't think I have the money to go , but , you know ...
 So ,
 I can tell you are ignoring my texts , which , under the circumstances , is quite a point of vulnerability .
 Yeah . I 'm sorry .
 Mm ...
 It 's just ... I just wasn 't expecting what happened between us to happen .
 - Yeah . - And , um ...

 I 've asked you all here to announce a new direction for your school .
 A fresh start .
 Moordale Secondary will soon be known as Sparkside Academy .
 [ students chattering ]
 I 'm sure you will have many questions , but our goals for Sparkside will be made clear at our upcoming open day .
 [ Hope ]
 We will also be inviting the press to show them that " Sex School " is a thing of the past .
 And speaking of press ,
 I 'm sure you 're all aware that our school once again made the news today .
 Take me now , Lord Vanon !
 [ students laughing ]
 Yes , it was very funny , wasn 't it ?
 However , the part where they called us an " institution full of sexual deviants " was not very funny at all .
 It seems that there are some students here who get a kick out of giving us a bad name .
 And it has to stop .
 So , Lily Iglehart , Cal Bowman , and Adam Groff , come to the stage , please .
 [ students whispering ]
 [ both mouthing ]
 [ Hope ] Take a seat , please .
 From now on , punishment will be dealt with differently on this campus .
 Will you read that out , please , Cal ?

 - This is fucked up !
 - Sit down , Jackson .

 I don 't think my story was dirty .
 Then why is everyone laughing at you ?
 [ whispering ]
 Read it .
 [ somber music playing ]
 " I wrote dirty and disgusting words which have brought shame on my peers . "
 Um , I can 't read that word .
 It says that you are unhygienic .
 Because what you did in France was filthy and put your peers at risk ...
 Enough !
 Sit down .
 It 's supposed to be school , not somewhere we should be afraid .
 Okay , you 're suspended .
 - What ? - [ Hope ] Leave .
 [ students ] What ?
 I said , leave !
 " I am unhygienic and put my peers at risk . "
 You will not be allowed your phones for the remainder of the week .
 No one is to speak to these students .
 And you will not be allowed to remove your sign until I say so .

 - What ?

 No .

 Have fun while you can .

 - What if you and Jimoh break up ?
 - Out !

 - Have you got a girlfriend , Eric ?
 - He hasn 't ... Eric doesn 't have time for girlfriends .

 - [ Maeve ] Hi . - [ Isaac ]
 Hi .
 - I wanted to make sure you 're okay . - [ Maeve ] Thank you .
 [ Anna ]
 You all right , Maeve ? - What 's he doing here ? - She needed a lift .
 That 's convenient .
 Well , I 'd better go inside and help , but thank you for dropping Maeve off .
 You know , I 'm gonna come help too .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ clattering ]
 [ woman ] Can you tell me about this morning ?
 [ Anna ] She seemed okay .
 - Her appeal for custody failed last month . - [ Otis whispers ] There you go .
 She 'd never been happy about the supervised visits . Thank you .
 She didn 't seem distracted ?
 Yes , did she seem on edge at all ?
 How about I ask the questions , boys ?
 Hm ?
 [ clears throat ] So , how did Erin seem this morning ?
 She wanted to take Elsie to the playground .
 I had never imagined ...
 Will my mum be in any trouble ?
 This is serious . She could face prison time when we find her .
 It 's gonna be all right .
 [ woman ]
 She used a cashpoint on Barrow Street at 10 : 17 a . m . , but that doesn 't give us any indication as to her whereabouts now .
 She 's probably left Moordale . Have you checked CCTV at the station ?
 Yeah , we have .
 - And what about buses ? - [ woman ] We thought about buses too .
 And you can tap her phone .
 Sorry , how are you both connected to the case again ?
 I 'm Maeve 's friend . He is her complicated love interest .
 You used to be her friend until you were an arsehole at that party .
 The only arsehole is the man who deleted my voice mail without telling her !
 Outside , both of you .
 - Outside . Yep .
 - Okay .
 [ Isaac ] Always popping up where people don 't want you .
 - Just go home , man ! - You ... you don 't know me .
 - Always making things worse . - What are you even doing ...
 Shut up ! The pair of you !
 My sister is missing . This is not an opportunity for you to swing your dicks around !
 Dunno how you can even think of choosing this guy over me .
 Choosing ? What are you talking about ?
 You 're so deluded !
 [ Isaac ] Oh right .
 Did something happen between you guys on the trip , then ?
 Yeah , yeah .
 But it doesn 't mean anything .
 I mean ... I do ... I don 't know what it means .
 Elsie 's missing . That 's all I care about right now .
 Well , good luck finding her , Maeve . Um ...
 Isaac , don 't go .
 [ Maeve ] Oh fuck .
 - Thanks , Otis . - I think I should stay and help .
 No , I don 't think you should . - You 'd make things worse !
 - What do you mean ?
 Since you stopped the clinic , you stopped caring about anyone but yourself .
 No , that 's not true .
 It ... it 's just not my responsibility .
 I think you should go .
 I don 't wanna see you anymore .
 Maeve .
 [ door closes ]
 [ Jean ] Jakob !
 Jakob !
 I think we need to work out what we 're going to tell the kids about why we 're sleeping in separate beds .
 I don 't think they need to know .
 It 's private between you and me .
 [ Jean ] Well , I disagree .
 Open dialogue is important with teenagers .
 Okay , you go ahead and tell them .
 [ distant clattering ]
 [ clattering ]
 I was just dropping off your book .
 [ Jakob continues hammering ] [ whimsical music playing ]
 Would you like to come in for a chat ?
 [ Jakob continues hammering ]
 Have a seat . [ sighs ]
 So , why did you decide to return my notebook ?
 I thought you should have it .
 So I assume it was also you who made the photocopies last term .
 Yes , it was .
 [ exhales ]
 And I 'm ashamed of my behavior .
 Um ...
 I keep reading the things Maureen said about me to you .
 And I think they 're all true .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 But I don 't know how to change .
 Come and voice your opinion at the Student Forum tonight .
 Thank you . Viv , listen , I 've had an idea .
 Let 's use the forum to ask people how they feel about Hope 's new values .
 If enough people don 't like what she 's doing , we can change things .
 - I can 't do that .
 - I don 't get it . Why are you trying to help her ? She 's bad news , Viv !
 Jackson , I 'm not an idiot , okay ? I need to get into a good university .
 It 's not just my dream . It 's important to my whole family .
 And I do not have the privilege to fuck up school .
 Viv , I know you 're not an idiot . You 're the smartest person I know .
 You 're kidding yourself if you think she cares about your dreams .
 [ announcement over PA ]
 Think about it .
 [ door closes ]
 I asked you to keep an eye on your peers during this trip .
 And then I hear rumors , and I 'm left feeling confused because when I asked you how the trip was going , you said ,
 " Great ! "
 So help me out here , Viv .
 I didn 't wanna get anyone into trouble .
 I ...
 - I felt in the middle .
 - Right .
 [ inhales ]
 When I first met you ,
 I thought ,
 " This girl 's going somewhere . "
 You know , " She 's driven . She 's focused . "
 But I don 't know how far you 're going to go if you can 't keep your head above the parapet .
 I 'm sorry . I ... I should have been honest .
 Don 't apologize to me .
 Apologize to yourself .
 I would hate to see you lose out on opportunities because of a need to play nice .
 It 's a very female trait , and it holds us back .
 It will not happen again .
 It better not .
 Oh , one more thing , Vivienne .
 I want you to make a presentation to the press and prospective students on our upcoming open day .
 Even after this ?
 Yes . You 're our head girl .
 And having a strong , smart , young woman of color leading the way shows how progressive we are as a school .
 So it 's about how it looks .
 Of course it is .
 Here 's the video and the slides for you to prepare with .
 Uh , will you be coming to the Student Forum ?
 Perhaps there 'll be some interesting ideas I can add to the presentation ?
 Why would I want to come and listen to a bunch of teenagers whinging on about their insignificant problems for an hour ?
 No , thank you .
 [ sighs ]
 I 've had quite enough of this navel- gazing , identity- obsessed hysteria for one day .
 The quicker you and your fragile , petty little peers realize that you 're not that special and that the real world doesn 't care about your supposed issues , the better .

 I 'd like to ask you about your childhood , Michael .
 Can you tell me about your mother ?
 She was quiet .
 And gentle .
 And she loved to cook .
 And she always smelled rather lovely ...
 Of shampoo .
 [ sentimental music playing ]
 And your father ?
 Dad . Well , he ...
 He was just different from my mum .
 [ laughing ]
 - Terrible , Dad , terrible . - You 're supposed to stop it .
 I think Michaela 's crying , Dad !
 What ?
 Why are you crying ?
 Stop it ! You 're a boy !
 Boys don 't cry .
 Hm .
 When was the last time you cried ?
 Can 't remember .
 [ sniffles ]
 Not even after your separation ?
 And what do you do that brings you pleasure ?
 Are you suggesting I ...
 Masturbate ?
 No .
 Believe it or not , Michael , I don 't think everything comes back to sex .
 [ chuckles ]
 What I 'm asking is , what do you do that makes you feel joy ?
 I don 't think I feel that emotion .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Very often , Michael , when children are bullied by a parent , they falsely learn that emotions are a sign of vulnerability , and so they shut them off .
 What I 'd like you to do is to find something that makes you happy .
 [ door opens ]
 Um , thank you .
 And I 'm sorry I said that thing about ...
 Masturbation .
 That 's really okay .
 However , in your case , Michael , masturbation might not be such a bad idea .
 [ Jean ] You okay ?
 What happened ?
 Oh , well , I just messed everything up . Again .
 ' Cause I am clearly incapable of forming healthy relationships with anyone .
 [ Otis sighs ]
 Is this about Maeve ?
 I 've never told you about Maeve .
 [ mischievous music playing ]
 Aimee mentioned , just briefly , in her session with me that you 'd had a romantic tension with someone called Maeve , and something happened at the party that you had here , and you fell out over something you said .
 Do you want to talk about it ?
 No , I don 't want to talk about it .
 Jealousy can make us act out of character and say things we don 't mean .
 - Was there another boy on the scene ? - You 're doing it ! Again !
 I can 't believe you had the audacity to tell me to stop giving out advice because I was being unethical .
 You are the most unethical woman in the world !
 - Why won 't you let me help you , Otis ? - Help me ?
 How could you possibly help me ?
 You push every man you come into contact with away .
 - You literally suck at relationships . - Where is this coming from , Otis ?
 You brought Jakob into my life .
 You make me live with Ola like a sister .
 And I like having them around . It feels normal , for once .
 But that 's over , isn 't it ?
 Yeah , that 's what I thought .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Shit .
 - [ Anna ] Thank you . - [ Maeve ]
 My pleasure .
 This is my fault . I should 've told you what my mum is like .
 Maeve , this is not your fault .
 You 're 17 . You shouldn 't have to deal with stuff like this anyway .
 It 's too much .
 [ car engine starting ]
 Will you stay tonight ?
 [ upbeat music playing ]
 [ indistinct chattering ]
 - Eric , what do you think of the wedding ?
 - Auntie Beryl !
 [ laughs ]
 It 's good ! It 's good , you know . I think ?
 - I don 't know . I 've not been to many . - Ah .
 You will go to more .
 [ both laugh ]
 [ Beryl sighs ]
 Hmm .
 Ah !
 See Emeka ?
 Mummy was heartbroken when Beatrice didn 't marry him .
 - Why ? - [ Beryl ]
 Hm .
 His family is good .
 Very wealthy !
 Ah !
 He would have given your mother the world . Uh , and what about my dad ?
 - Your father ?
 [ chuckles ] - Uh- huh .
 [ tuts ]
 He was a very local guy ! So bush !
 Hm .
 You see ? Mummy didn 't even think he had any prospects .
 Wow , wow .
 - But he 's proven us all wrong .
 - [ chuckles ]
 And he has made a name for himself in England .
 Mm .
 Ah !
 They barely gave me any stew !
 - Auntie .
 - [ speaking angrily in Yoruba ]
 Auntie !
 [ laughs ]
 [ upbeat music continues ]
 [ laughing ]

 [ music stops ]
 [ Ola ]
 Hey .
 I 'm so sorry she did this to you .
 I was happy not having any friends .
 And then you came along and made me feel like I wasn 't so strange after all , but it was just a lie .
 You told me not to submit my story because you said it was weird , and then you judged me .
 I was only trying to protect you .
 You shouldn 't be speaking to me .
 [ melancholy music playing ]
 Jackson ?
 - Hey .
 Um ...
 - Hey .
 Thanks for sticking up for me . What Hope did was complete bullshit .
 - I know . - And I think we should fight this .
 - All right . Let 's do it . - [ phone chimes ]

 My name 's Oba .
 Uh , I 'm Eric .
 You must go to a lot of these , then ?
 Oh . No , not really .
 The groom is my close friend .
 Ah .
 I 've always taken photographs as a hobby , and he 's a bit cheap .
 [ both laugh ]
 [ Oba ] It 's funny . I feel happy for them , but also a bit sad .
 Because I know I 'll never have this for myself .
 Do you know what I mean ?
 Ah ...
 I thought we weren 't supposed to talk about that here .
 There are lots of people like us here .
 We just have to speak quietly .
 I 'm going out after this if you want to meet them .
 Uh , no , no . I , uh ,
 I don 't think I can .
 Okay .

 - Hm .
 - [ door opens ]
 - What are you doing here ?
 - [ door closes ]
 I feel bad that you got suspended for me .
 I got suspended for my beliefs .
 I , uh ...
 I 'm trying to write a poem for Eric , and I thought you could help me .
 [ chuckles ]
 You want me to help you write a poem for my ex- boyfriend ?
 Forget it .
 [ sighs ]
 Let me see the poem .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 - " Eric , you make me smile ... " - Do you have to read it out loud ?
 [ sighs ]
 This is a bad poem .
 You need to write from your heart .
 Not overthink .
 You shouldn 't try to write poetry because I write it .
 I 'm not . I 'm ... I 'm ...
 I 'm writing it because Eric likes it .
 What about you ? What do you like ?
 I ...
 I , um , I like ...
 Dogs .
 I 'm a cat person .
 Of course you are .

 [ " Fall " by Davido playing ]
 [ Eric ] Oh ! Well , we 're out in Lagos , baby !

 Yeah , okay . Thank you . I 'll be right back .
 You ... What ?

 So I ... I just don 't know you that well , and I think I should probably go .
 [ Oba ] What ? We just got here .

 No , sorry , where did you go before ?
 I was checking escape routes .

 [ " Joro " by Wizkid playing ]
 How do you feel ?
 Like I 've come home .
 [ laughs ]
 [ song fades ]
 [ snoring ]
 [ whimsical music playing ] [ groans ]
 Oba ?
 Hm ?
 - [ Eric whispers ]
 Oba , wake up .
 - [ groans ]
 Oba , wake up . I ... I need to go home .
 My family will be worried .
 [ Oba ] Okay .
 It was nice to meet you .
 What do you mean , nice to meet me ?
 How am I supposed to get home ? We 're in Lagos !
 [ chuckles ]
 I 'm kidding .
 I 'll make sure you get home okay .
 Fine .
 [ both laugh ]
 Um ...
 Did we ...
 No .
 Cool .
 [ Oba chuckles ]
 [ chicken clucking ]
 Where were you ?
 I was worried !
 I was out with Oba .
 - He showed me some of Lagos . - Why didn 't you tell me ?
 Well , you were too busy flirting with your ex- fiancé .
 - [ scoffs ] Eric , that 's ... - No , Mum .
 I was so excited to come back here , you know ?
 And all we 've done since arriving is lie .
 Why 'd you tell everyone Dad is a successful accountant ?
 Your dad is an accountant . At least , he was when he lived here .
 No ... no , but he 's not back home .
 So ... [ scoffs ] ... why don 't you tell the truth ?
 - Are you ashamed of him ? - Not at all !
 [ sighs ]
 But my mother didn 't always approve of your father .
 It 's been easier to lie !
 [ Eric sighs ]
 Do you wish you married that Emeka guy instead of Dad ?
 [ laughs ]
 No ! That man is so vain !
 We were never the right fit .
 Not like your father . What do you mean ?
 Being with your dad , I always felt at peace .
 I don 't want to pretend , Mum .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Not here or anywhere .
 I love that you 're not afraid to be yourself , Eric .
 [ Eric sniffles ]
 Maybe one day I 'll get there too , hm ?
 - But it takes time . - [ sniffles ]
 [ sniffles ]
 I 'm sorry for scaring you , Mum .
 [ sniffles ]
 I 'll make you something to eat , hm ?
 [ Beatrice chuckles ]
 [ emotional music continues ]
 [ phone chimes ]
 [ pensive music playing ]



 Thank Abeo for my beautiful presents .
 - Tell him he must visit next time ! - [ Beatrice ] I will tell him .
 [ Eric chuckles ]
 - Oh , Eric !
 - Mm .
 You let me know when you get yourself a girlfriend .
 - Actually , Mummy , Eric is dating someone . - Mm- hmm .
 I told him not to tell you until he knew it was serious .
 Huh .
 Ah !
 - [ Eric chuckles ] - What is she like ?
 [ laughing ]
 - Uh ...
 - Mm- hmm .
 They don 't talk much , but they really love dogs .
 - Mm- hmm .
 - And , uh , they can be very kind .
 Mm- hmm .
 - And they make me laugh .
 - [ both laugh ]
 A lot .
 [ laughs ]
 And I think you 'd really like them .
 Laughter does wonders for the heart . They sound like a good choice .
 - Come on .
