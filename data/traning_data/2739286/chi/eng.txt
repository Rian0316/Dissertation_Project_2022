 00 : 00 : 04, 227 -- > 00 : 00 : 05, 511 What you doing ? You said clean up .
 I 'm cleaning up .
 You can 't just throw everything in the closet .
 Hey , you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it , but you can 't do both ; this isn 't sex .
 What if someone looks in there ? They 're just coming over for dinner .
 No one 's gonna look in the closet . Well , you don 't know that .
 What if someone 's looking for the bathroom and they open that door ?
 Could work out .
 For all we know , there 's a toilet in there somewhere . Fine .
 But after tonight , we need to get a handle on this mess . You know what we should do ?
 We should show the closet to Sheldon . Why ?
 ( scoffs ) Are you kidding ?
 He 's like a savant at organizing .
 Everything in his apartment has a label on it .
 Including his label maker , which has a label that says " Label Maker . "
 And if you look really close at that label maker label , you 'll see a label that says " Label . "
 He 's our guest ; we can 't just ask him to straighten our closet .
 No , we wouldn 't ask him .
 We 'd just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there .
 Hey , guys , come on in . Hi .
 Hi .
 Ooh , it smells good . Thanks .
 And , Sheldon , I know tonight 's the night you eat Thai food , so I went to the Asian market , got all the ingredients and made it from scratch .
 Oh , you shouldn 't have . Oh , it 's my pleasure .
 No , you really shouldn 't have .
 I brought my own .
 You stopped and got him takeout ? I had no choice .
 He kept kicking the back of my seat .
 Sheldon , I 've been cooking all day .
 Well ... now don 't you feel silly .

 These spring rolls are amazing .
 Good job , Bernadette .
 That 's the takeout that Sheldon brought .
 Oh , well , I 'm sure they wouldn 't have tasted nearly as good if I hadn 't tried your food first .
 Howard , did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by color ?
 Color 's fine .
 Wrong , they 'll be arranged seasonally .
 Sheldon , aren 't you gonna spend a little time with Amy ?
 Oh , it 's okay , I 'm used to it .
 The other day at Whole Foods , he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle .
 Yeah , and some thanks I got .
 The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami .
 His quirks just make you love him more .
 Someone please agree with me .
 Sheldon , come on .
 It 's getting late . Time to go .
 Oh , five more minutes .
 That 's what you said five minutes ago .
 Amy and Penny are already in the car . Let 's move it .
 How come I never get to do anything I want to do ?
 You know , if he really wants to stay and finish ,
 I can give him a ride home .
 Please , Leonard !
 He said it 's okay ! Sheldon , it 's --
 Wait , I can go home without you ? Bye !
 Howard , I have a few questions .
 I found three bowling pins .
 Now , do you juggle these , or are you missing seven ?
 Juggle .
 You health nuts kill me .
 ( gasps )
 Oh , my God , it 's beautiful !
 Look , he found the juggling pins I hid .
 Uh , just a couple more items .
 Howard , I found this letter from your dad in a box .
 Now , based on the content , it could either be filed ...
 Whoa , you opened this ?
 Well , I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia .
 Now , as I was saying , based on the content ...
 I couldn 't be less interested .

 Now , come on , I 'll take you home .
 Howard , don 't you want to know what 's in the letter ?
 If I wanted to know , I would 've opened it years ago . The closet looks great .
 Let 's get out of here . Wait , can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride ?
 Do whatever you want .
 Thanks . Oh .
 Great party .

 You know , when I first met Howard , he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say , " Oh , I sat in gum . "

 What is your point ?
 Well , it 's just kind of weird how grown up he is now .
 Happily married guy throwing dinner parties .
 Really ? You couldn 't just say that ?
 You had to tell the scrotum story ?
 Trying to paint a picture . Yeah , it was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table .
 Mm , you know , we could throw a dinner party , too .
 Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up .
 Sure .
 Just , when you say " dressed up , " you mean nice clothes , right ?
 Not , like , capes and tights and crap ?
 Yeah .
 Although ...
 No !

 Howie , you okay ?
 Yeah , I just ... couldn 't sleep .
 Told you you shouldn 't have espresso after dinner .
 I know the little cups make you feel big , but it 's not worth it .
 It 's this stupid letter . Did you read it ?
 No . You must be curious .
 Of course I 'm curious . I haven 't seen the man since , oh , I was a little kid .
 And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday ?
 What 's that about ?
 Why don 't you read it ?
 Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left .
 He abandoned me and my mother .
 Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything ?
 I get that . ( sighs )
 So , what do you want to do with it ?
 Something I should 've done a long time ago .

 Really ?
 Are you sure ?
 Yep .
 ( sighs )
 ( sighs )
 Feel better ?
 I do .
 ( smoke detector beeping )
 Great .
 Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that .
 I can 't believe he set it on fire .
 Yeah , just seeing that letter really freaked him out .
 And he was already having a tough day
 ' cause he accidentally wore my pants to work .
 I don 't know why was upset .
 They were bigger on him than me .
 Boy , I 'm really curious what 's in that letter .
 Me , too , but I guess now we 'll never know .
 Well , you said Sheldon read it . Why not ask him ?
 I can 't do that .
 What kind of wife would I be if I didn 't respect my husband 's privacy ?
 What if I ask Sheldon , you just happen to be in the room ?
 That works .
 Okay .
 ( sighs )
 Blech . Like cleaning out the entire building 's belly button .

 Hey , Sheldon .
 Oh , hello . What can I do for you ladies ?
 You have something we want .
 Oh , dear .
 My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city .
 No , we just want information . Oh .
 Oh , I 've got that in spades .
 Ravage me .
 We heard you read the letter from Howard 's father .
 I did . What did it say ?
 Yeah ... I can 't tell you that . I 'm bound by closet organizer / organizee confidentiality .

 Sheldon , that 's not a real thing .
 Well , neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend 's hand at the movies . You know . That doesn 't stop you from pawing at me
 like you 're a bear and I 'm a trash can full of sweets .
 Why do you even care ?
 Just tell us what it says .
 Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard .
 By happenstance , I came to know it .
 That doesn 't give me the right to disseminate it freely .
 Come on . Look , the letter was found in Bernadette 's closet .
 Doesn 't that count for something ?
 Are you pointing out that California is a community property state , and since Howard and Bernadette are married , the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses ?

 Yeah , obviously .
 Well played .
 Sometimes I don 't give you enough credit , Penny . Dude , you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party .
 Actually , all I did was invite you .
 Well , put your mind at ease .
 I 'm here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard 's dinner party 's ass .
 Now , the first thing we need is a theme .
 I 'm thinking ... ah , turn- of- the- century Moulin Rouge .
 I 'm thinking you need a testosterone patch .
 Penny and I just want to do something low- key . You know , cocktails ,
 light jazz music , hors d 'oeuvres .
 So your theme is " I saw a rerun of and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe 's " ?
 Hate to miss that . Hey , where have you been ?
 Oh , Leonard .
 If I was prone to sarcasm ,
 I 'd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten .
 ( exhales )
 I meant , " Golly , Sheldon , you 've been gone a long time . " Oh .
 Yeah , well , I was waylaid by Penny , Bernadette and Amy .
 They made me reveal confidential information about Howard 's father . What information ?
 I can 't tell you that . I am bound by closet organizer / organizee confidentiality .

 Well , come on , we won 't tell anyone .
 Sorry , badgering me won 't work .
 What you should have said is ,
 " It 's pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us . " Fine , then that .
 All right , I 'll tell you .
 My goodness , everyone 's on their game today .


 ( Latin jazz music playing ) This is really fun .
 Yeah , it 's nice to get dressed up once in a while .
 Yeah , and hors d 'oeuvres are delightful .
 As is the company .
 Aw .
 My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead .
 Hey , uh , listen , everybody .
 Before Howard gets here , let 's all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father . Of course . Sure .
 Absolutely .
 If I say yes , can we turn off that Latin orgy music ?
 Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs .
 Yeah , try doing it in heels . I am .
 ( chuckles )
 Wait .
 There 's something I have to tell you .
 What ?
 I know what was in your dad 's letter .
 Sheldon , I swear to God , I 'm gonna kill you !
 Hey !
 I made him tell us .
 What ? " Us " ? Who else knows ?
 I know .
 Me , too . Same here .
 Shame on all of you .
 You know , too . Couldn 't leave him with one friend , could you ?
 So everybody knows what 's in that letter except for me ?
 Yes , it 's six against one .
 Stand down , sir .
 How could you do this ?
 I 'm sorry . If you want , we could tell you .
 No , I don 't want to know !
 I mean ,
 I do , but ...
 I got to go .
 Used me as a human shield ?
 I panicked .
 He looked taller than usual .


 BERNADETTE :
 Howard ? In here .
 I 'm sorry .
 I should have left it alone .
 It 's okay .
 Sorry I ran off like that .
 What are you looking at ?
 Uh , pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid .
 That 's nice .
 I got to tell you , as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing , he did a hell of a job organizing this closet .
 Look at this .
 " Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever . "

 Check out nine- year- old Howie with cornrows .
 Neither race was happy to see me with those .

 Think you could take a break ?
 Why ? Got a little surprise for you .
 Come on . Oh , honey ...
 I am in no mood to have sex tonight .
 I 'll lay there if you absolutely have to have it , but ...
 Oh .
 What are you guys doing here ?
 When you left , you weren 't sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad 's letter , so we came up with kind of a cool solution .
 Oh , yeah , what 's that ?
 It 's simple , really .
 It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition .
 The- the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once .
 We were all thinking it , really .
 It was kind of the elephant in the room , so ...
 Anyway , um , I realize if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you , only one of which is true , and then we don 't tell you which one it is , you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence .


 Yeah .
 And I said if it wasn 't epistemic , we might as well not do it .

 Sit down , honey .
 Raj , you 're up .
 Okay , um ... ( clears throat )
 It was a card for your 18th birthday . Inside it said ,
 " Happy birthday , Howard . I love you .

 Dad . "
 Oh , and it was a Far Side card , the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane .
 Thinks it 's a fly .
 Silly frog .
 So funny . Sheldon . ( clears throat )
 It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One- Eyed Willy .
 Nice try .
 That 's the plot for
 Told you .
 Don 't . Amy .
 You didn 't know it , but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation .
 And he cried because he was so proud of you .
 Really ?
 Or that 's complete poppycock which Amy made up . It still could be the map .
 Penny .
 It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn 't who he said he was .
 Eventually , his other life caught up to him , and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave .
 I would like to change mine .
 The pirate 's name was Peg- Leg Antoine .
 Now it 's completely different from
 No , it 's not .
 Don 't . Okay , my turn .
 Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing , and that you should never throw it away like he did .
 Hmm . Bernadette .
 Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born .
 On the back he wrote ,
 " Howard , my son , my greatest gift . "
 ( sighs )
 You okay ?
 Yeah .
 I 'm terrific .
 So ... ?
 Which one do you think it is ... matey ?
 Actually , I don 't want to know .
 I ... want all of them to be true .
 Well , one of them is .
 That 's pretty cool .
 Thank you , guys .
 Hey , it 's still early .
 Why don 't we go back and have that party ? Yeah , cool .
 Okay ? Good .
 SHELDON :
 You know , surprisingly , uh , the letter from your father wasn 't the most interesting thing
 I read in the closet .
 Bernadette 's diary has some saucy passages .
 Sheldon , don 't you dare !
 Th- There 's nothing to worry about .
 Your secret 's safe with me .
 That 's more like it .
 Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review .
 ( Latin jazz music playing )


 Glad you 're feeling better . Me , too .
 If I 'd known we were gonna be dancing , would have worn my flats .
 This turned out pretty well , huh ?
 Yeah , I think so .
 ( chuckles ) I agree .
 That is , if you 've never been to or heard of a party before .
 If you 'd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place , you 'd be happy all the time .
 Uh , Penny ,
 I- I have a couple of questions about your closet .
 Is there any reason you 're keeping this dead goldfish ?
 Damn , I forgot to feed him .
 And that I had him .
 Well , now , did you also have a dog ?
 Because I found what appears to be a battery- operated chew toy .
 Party 's over !
 Party 's over !
