 This is what happens when you miss an episode of " Shameless . "
 Your entire life goes completely to shit .
 when I was in the ICU for the last month ?
 We were kind of hoping you were dead .
 - -
 What about finishing college ? - Is that off the table ?
 - I got a professor . Uh , he 's gonna help me find something ... a tech startup .
 It just might be a while before I get paid , you know ?
 This management thing is a pain in my ass . I 'm losing money .
 Tell you what . Pay yourself an extra 50¢ an hour , make up the difference .
 - An extra buck an hour . - Done .

 Nice stroller . Where 'd you get it ? -
 Dom won 't go down on me ' cause I 'm not circumcised .
 It has all this extra skin , and it kind of freaks me out .
 I can 't feel a thing . - Don 't worry . You will soon .
 I 'm meeting an old high school friend for dinner .
 - -
 Please tell me she has a dick .
 You have no balance sheet , no income or cash flow forecast .
 Our yield on gross revenues are shit .
 Are we seriously not gonna have sex ? ' Cause I kind of took a Viagra .
 Oh , yeah , just walk right by , ignore your father

 Hey , Hector ?
 Hi , it 's Fiona .
 Oh , shit . Hang on !
 Hi , you still there ?
 Sorry . Uh ...
 Can you work today ? Santos called in sick again .
 Yeah , I 'm tired of his bullshit , too .
 You can ?
 Oh , that 's great . Okay . I 'll see you at ten .
 I thought you were living at Caleb 's ? Caleb 's sleeping with a chick .
 - He 's bi ? - No dude is bi , all right ?
 You lick dick , you 're supposed to be gay .
 So you guys broke up ? Haven 't decided yet . Probably .
 God , I can 't believe he 's licking vag , too .
 All right , can you guys please stop talking about licking vag ?
 - You 're gonna give me a boner . - You sleep at all last night ?
 No , if I wake up with morning wood , it 'll pop my stitches .
 You 're 16 . How are you gonna not get wood for 72 hours ?
 Eyes on the prize , my brother .
 Yeah , which is ? A blowie from Dominique .
 The chick who made you cut your dick ? Yeah , man , no girl 's worth that .
 She didn 't make me . I wanted to . You guys just don 't understand true love .
 Uh , you know , it 's pretty cold out there . You better put on a turtleneck .
 Oh , oh ! Excuse you .
 Oh , you got to forgive Carl , his manners were in his foreskin .
 Uh , stop it !
 It just gives me the willies thinking about someone near my junk with a knife .
 Where is my vacuum cleaner ?
 - Upstairs probably . - Kev , grab our cleaning shit .
 What 's all that crap ? I 'm helping Fiona with the bills over at Patsy 's .
 Place is in a financial shitstorm . Yeah , the Alibi , too .
 Svetlana 's getting things in order , which makes me the house husband .
 I keep forgetting about the weird situation you got going on with the two wives .
 It 's not weird . It 's modern .
 You 're gonna have to draw me a Venn diagram to explain how that works .
 What 's up with mopey ? Ah , boy trouble .
 Girl trouble .
 I 'll draw you a Venn diagram to explain that , too .
 Where 's my vacuum ? What are you doing ?
 Uh , vacuum , hall closet . And I 'm getting rid of Frank 's shit .
 That fuckhead 's back in the house ? Yeah , nailed the door shut from the inside .
 - How 's he getting in and out ? - I don 't know . Window ?
 Ladder ?
 Get a restraining order on his ass .
 That would mean that I cared . And I don 't anymore .
 Aren 't you angry with him about destroying your future ?
 Did me a favor . Come on , help me bring his crap downstairs .
 Good morning , my wasted sperms .
 Frank , you 're walking . In a weird way , but you 're walking .
 - Why don 't you go away , Frank ?
 Is that any way to greet your soon to be ex- father ?
 Ex- father ? We would be so lucky .
 Filling out the paperwork to disinherit you abortion- should- have- beens .
 Disinherit ? Wow . So we don 't get that jelly jar ?
 - Or the three pieces of silverware you stole from the Ramada Inn ?
 Or the shame and the embarrassment ?
 Go ahead , joke all you like .
 But once my parental rights are terminated , you can no longer use the Gallagher family name .
 Hallelujah ! I 'm just gonna be like Cher and go by Fiona .
 Here 's your shit . I 'm taking my room back . And I 'm padlocking the house .
 Aw , you made me toast . Thanks .
 Buh- bye , got to go to work .
 You can 't get rid of me that easily .
 Has she talked to anybody about what happened at the wedding ?
 - Not to me . - Me neither .
 Tumors are repressed feelings , you know .
 - Come on . Liam , let 's go . - What ?
 He 's the only one that stands a fighting chance to become a real Gallagher .
 - No fucking way ! - Eh , you can 't just take him , Frank .
 Yes , I can . I 'm his father . And he is staying in the will .
 Aren 't you ?
 Do you think , in his own way , Frank 's actually a pretty good dad ?
 No . Jesus .
 - Well , look who it is ... Beauty and the Beast .
 I 'll leave it to you two to figure out who 's who .
 Too bad you 're walking again , Frank . I was praying for permanent paralysis .
 Where 'd you get the stroller , Debs ?
 The only thing Monica and I could afford to stroll you guys around in was a Kroger shopping cart .
 Hey , give me that ! It 's not yours . Well , apparently it 's not yours either .
 - Ugh . - Maureen Wilson .
 Looks like you already cleaned out the cash , Little Orphan Angry , so , uh ... I 'll take the platinum .
 You can 't do that , Frank !
 Should I call Ms. Wilson , let her know you found it ?
 Fine , take it . Careful , Liam .
 I used to think Frank would be a real dad someday , too .
 You and that little spic you sneezed out of the cavern you called your uterus better start looking for a new last name .
 I 'm disinheriting both of you and taking back the Gallagher name .
 Gladly .
 And while I 'm at it , Franny 's gonna go by her middle name from now on ... Harriet .
 Harry . So she has no more connection to you .
 Harry ! Well , that 's a perfect name for the diesel dyke she 's gonna grow up to be someday .
 Come on , kid . We got work to do .
 - Hey , Carl . Hey , bunch of us are going to the movies tonight . You want to come ?
 I told you , I can 't hang out with you for 72 hours .
 Thought that meant we just couldn 't fool around ?
 Even just being in your vicinity gives me a boner .
 That 's so sweet . Seriously , stop .
 Hey , freak fuck ! Heard you got a tranny operation .
 I only told a couple of people . Got your penis chopped off . Now you 're a lady .
 Not that you were that far off to begin with . See you around , Bruce Jenner .
 Hey , Bruce Jenner was the dude , so fuck you guys . Thanks for the compliment .
 Don 't listen to them . Okay , I think you 're manly for what you did .
 And when the 72 hours and one second is over ,
 I 'm gonna loosen your belt , then take off your pants ...
 - No . - Then your underwear .
 No , no , stop .
 - Then suck your lollipop . - I 'm serious . Oh , fuck .
 I thought you said I just couldn 't go near you ?
 Where are you going ? We have class .
 Doctor , clinic , now .
 That 's a burger well- done , with crispy fries , and a Denver omelet , extra ham .
 And let me get you a refill on these sodas . Yeah .
 We 'll get that cleared up for you in just a sec .
 - You get my order on 14 ? - Oh , yeah , I did . You 're two hours late .
 I called Melinda . Said it wasn 't busy .
 So you figured you 'd just come in whenever you felt like it ?
 I had laundry to do . Melinda was cool with it .
 I 'm glad you guys feel like you can just change my schedule whenever you want .
 What Sean always let us do . In case you haven 't noticed , Sean 's not here anymore .
 - Excuse me . - Yeah , that 's too bad .
 - Game Change , please hold .
 Phillip . Tito . - Senior intern .
 - Hey .
 Nice to meet you .
 All right , follow me , I 'll show you around .
 Uh , you can start by getting coffee for the Three Musketeers .
 - Who ? - The owners , Phillip .
 - Two million !
 This is , uh , Sarah , head of sales and marketing .
 Black coffee , extra hot , splash of 2 % .
 Jesse , I buy ad space on your stupid network every Sunday .
 Least you could do is cut me a deal for the playoffs .
 Joe , brains behind the operation and the VC guy . Raised the money to start this place .
 - He okay ? - Uh , new heated floors . - He gets cold .
 Green tea , steeped for three minutes , one Truvia .
 Gene . Tech .
 Four double shots of espresso before noon , wears a new pair of socks every day , throws out the old ones .
 You 'll help him put them on . He doesn 't like to take the goggles off .
 - Copy that . - Uh ...
 Sign is self- explanatory .
 Kitchen is yours , too . There 's a grocery list on the bulletin board .
 - Three million !
 All right ! Whoo !
 Hey , uh , listen , you get paid , you know , being the senior intern ?
 No , um , but last senior intern just got a job at Porsche marketing .
 100 grand a year , was only here eight months , so ...
 But you can get started with the coffee and the tea .
 - Yeah . - All right ?
 And , Phillip ? Um ... get me an iced soy latte .


 Buenos días .
 Frank Gallagher . My son , Liam .
 Looking for some workers to help with a home masonry project .
 Pick three guys with a strong physique and a dumb disposition .
 - You , you , you .
 You make me proud , my one and only son . Very proud .
 Uh , the supplies I need .

 - Frank fucking Gallagher . You got money for once , Frank ?
 Credit card .
 And could I get a $400 cash advance on that card ? And keep $100 for yourself .
 Whatever you say , Mrs. Wilson .
 Yo . How come you didn 't come home last night or answer my texts ?
 Busy .
 Care to elaborate ? I don 't know , ask Denise .
 Is that what this is about ? My high school girlfriend ? Your high school girlfriend who you fuck .
 Whoa , whoa , whoa . What are you talking about ? - I saw you with her last night .
 - You 're spying on me ? Yeah , 'cause I knew you 'd been cheating on me .
 I wasn 't cheating . So you didn 't fuck Denise , then ?
 Cheating would be if I sucked some guy 's cock , all right ?
 - So you didn 't sleep with her ? - I didn 't say that .
 - Well , I 'm confused . - How do you think I feel ? You 're the one calling me a cheater .
 You still haven 't answered the question . Did you or did you not fuck Denise ?
 - What 's the big deal ? - What 's the big deal ?
 - She 's an old friend . - Who you fuck !
 We 've been sleeping together since we were kids . Don 't make this into something more than it is .
 You 're taking your dick , you 're putting it into a vagina .
 And you 're telling me you 've never done that before ? No , I haven 't !
 - I 'm gay . - So am I !
 Sticking my dick in a friend 's vagina doesn 't make me not gay . Are you hearing this , Raul ?
 This is why I didn 't want to tell you ... Because I didn 't want you freaking out the way you are right now .
 Oh , gee , sorry .
 Hey , how should I react when you say you 've been screwing a woman ?
 I don 't know .
 Maybe by being more accepting of your partner 's normal , sexually fluid experiences , maybe by sharing some of your own .
 I don 't have anything to share .
 I 'm gay , all right ? 100 % gay .
 - No one 's 100 % anything . - Yeah , well , I am , all right ?
 So now this inexperienced vagina- fucker has got to get to work .
 Uh , you Trisha ? I am .
 It 's brand- new .
 How much did you want , again ?
 Like I said in the ad , at the store , it 's 2, 500 , but I can let it go for two .
 How about 1, 500 ? You 're haggling with me ?
 Isn 't that what Craigslist is all about ?
 It 's also about people advertising baby stuff , and when the pregnant lady shows up , they cut the baby out of her stomach .
 - You doing all right ? You 're sewing on my penis , you tell me .
 You don 't have a lot of undamaged skin left down here . Yeah , because you chopped it all off .
 I warned you this would be difficult . It 's harder than I thought to not get an erection .
 You can get through this , son . Just put your mind to it .
 I literally think about sex 70, 000 times a day . Have to find other things to focus on .
 Like what ?
 Hairy balls can work . Or your grandmother naked .
 I 've even had patients suggest to me that watching Ted Cruz on CSPAN is an effective measure for preventing an erection .
 Okay , guys , here 's your Snappy . - Snap , snap , snap , snap , snap .
 Here 's ... I don 't know what this is , but you guys like it , and here 's your tennis racket .

 All right , you guys play . Daddy 's got to clean this place up , all right ?
 Yevgeny , get that out of your mouth !
 What are you doing , man ? You 're gonna light yourself up like a Christmas tree .
 How 'd you get my phone ?
 How 'd you get my phone ? Come on , now .
 I got to move all these weights . I got to clean this place up .
 Okay , let me just take a break here for just a second .
 You know what ? I 'm gonna use you as my weights .
 - Don 't worry , Gemma . I 'll use you in my next set .
 - Whee ! - Whee !
 - Whee !
 Shit , you are heavy .
 * Happy birthday to you *
 * Happy birthday to you *
 * Happy birthday , dear Sherrie *
 * Happy birthday to you *
 Excuse me ?
 I 'm looking for Chad . Is he around ? Chad !
 Okay .
 Thank you .
 Actually , uh , sorry to bother you . I work at Patsy 's . I wanted to let Chad know ...
 Where ? Patsy 's ... Pies .
 Oh , yeah , the dump on Franklin . You know it .
 Uh , I 've been filling in as manager . I 'd like to quit , go back to waiting tables .
 That 's fine . Do whatever you want . Are you allowed to say that ?
 I mean , don 't you have to run it by Chad first ?
 Red velvet .
 I know it 's not your favorite , boss , but Sherrie wanted it for her birthday .
 Oh .
 - Hey . - Hi .
 Zoning board is on my ass . Where is that , uh , environmental impact study for the redevelopment project ?
 - Which one ? - The west side .
 I 'll call Fitz , tell him we need it ASAP .
 Oh , and this one . She works at that shithole over on Franklin .
 - Patsy 's . - Yeah , she wants to quit .
 - You do ? - Well , as manager .
 I want to go back to waiting tables .
 - We should just shut it down . - What ?
 Eh , it 's just ... it 's not worth the aggravation .
 - Well , you can 't close it . - Why not ?
 I depend upon it to feed my family . You just quit .
 That 's the problem with having a family . Well , I didn 't think it would lead to you closing it .
 Well , it 's on its last legs , anyway . We 're planning on redeveloping that whole block .
 You sure ? Remember what happened to that chicken place over on LaSalle ?
 Homeless guy started that kitchen fire to stay warm , burnt half the building down .
 If I stayed on as manager , would you keep it open ?
 Fine . Just don 't lose any money .
 Well , the only way to do that is to fire people . I mean , the old manager hired so many unreliable ...
 Did you hear what I said ? Just keep it afloat .
 Okay .
 Andale , gringos !
 Andale !
 Whoo . Nice wheels .
 Ah , thanks , I jacked it ... or it 's one of my boss 's cars .
 Sent me to get it detailed . Looks pretty clean already .
 Yeah , I was thinking about just wiping it down , pocketing the 100 bucks .
 I don 't have a lot of time , so I ordered for you . Sweet , thanks .
 So what 's up ? You sounded pretty freaked .
 I , uh ... confronted Caleb about that chick .
 He 's screwing her .
 I guess there 's something to be said for honesty , right ? Except he says it 's not cheating .
 How 'd he come up with that reasoning ? Says if it were a guy , then he 'd be cheating .
 I guess that kind of sort of makes sense .
 I 'd rather have my girlfriend sleeping with other chicks than some dude .
 - You ever fuck a guy before ? - Fuck , no .
 ' Cause you 're 100 % straight , right ? Absolutely .
 Yeah , well , Caleb 's trying to argue that no one 's 100 % anything .
 It 's cheater 's logic .
 Ever think about experimenting ? With a dude ? No .
 Think it makes you less ... worldly or some shit ?
 Why ? Are you thinking about experimenting with a chick ?
 No . I don 't know , maybe .
 So what would you do , right ?
 You 're with this chick , bombshell chick , you 're fooling around , you know ?
 Look down , you realize a guy had joined .
 He 's sucking your dick .
 How far along am I ?
 - So you 're like 93 % straight . - It 's like 96 % straight .
 All right .

 " Help wanted " ?
 Yeah , I got to cover the mornings when you need to do your laundry , right ?
 Girl , you got a target on your back .
 You 're the bitch who told me to stay home this morning .
 Let 's make things a little easier for us this time , Harry .
 We 'll steal the stroller someone wants instead of finding someone who wants the stroller we have .
 And now we wait and see what happens , Harry .
 Holy shit , Harry , we got an email already . It 's for the Bugaboo stroller .
 Hello , Melanie ? Hi , you contacted me about the Baby Bugaboo ?
 Yes , it 's still here ... I mean available . Uh , just one sec .
 Hi , sorry .
 Um ... where are you coming from ?
 Great , I 'm not too far from you .
 Why don 't we meet at the , uh , Trader Joe 's on Ontario ? Great , I 'll see you there in 30 minutes .
 Excuse me ?
 I saw the " help wanted " sign at the window . Uh- huh .
 Can I leave my résumé with you ? - Uh- huh .
 - Thanks . Uh- huh .
 Oh , fu ...
 Son of a bitch !
 Chugga- chugga , chugga- chugga , choo .
 Hey , Hully Gully , I just cleaned that floor , man .
 Man , what 're you laughing at ?
 Again with my clean floor .
 Here we go .
 Oh !
 No , you didn 't .
 No , you didn 't !
 Ah , screw this . Food fight !
 Animal crackers , flying in !
 - Oh !
 Oh !
 Work looks good , gentlemen . Gracias .
 Fiona 's gonna be mad . Mm , tough titties .
 Gallagher and Son would like to thank you for your efficiency .
 Uno momento .
 This is where we lowball the illegals .
 They got nothing over us after the work is done .
 Here we go , as promised , $50 each . You said 100 .
 How about we make it 75 , and I won 't have you deported ?
 - How about we make it 100 , and we won 't murder you and the little brown boy in your sleep ?
 You 've jogged my memory . It ... it was $100 each .
 I was in a coma . I- I was in the hospital . I was in a coma .
 I get ...
 Lucky you caught me . Was about to go home .
 I don 't feel so lucky right now .
 I can barely find any skin you haven 't torn to sew back together .
 Jesus !
 I did the best I could . Put on your pants .
 Carefully .
 If it happens again , you 're gonna be in trouble .
 I may have no choice but to turn that thing into a vagina .
 Hairy balls , son .
 Hairy balls .
 You got restaurant experience ? I 've been waiting tables since I was 13 .
 - Any felony convictions ? - Nope .
 Are you working right now ? The place I was at , Pelloni 's , closed down .
 Uh , it 's being turned into a Urban Outfitters .
 The owner here wanted to close this place down , too , but she 's giving me a shot to turn it around .
 Sounds cool . That is just the kind of enthusiasm that I 'm looking for .
 - When can you start ? - As soon as you want me to .
 That 's great . It 's minimum wage , plus shared tips .
 See you tomorrow at noon for training .
 Thank you so much , Miss Gallagher .
 - Hey , Olga ? - Yeah ? You 're fired .
 You can 't fire me .
 I 'm the only woman of color , and I will sue your ass .
 Excuse me , where 's the manager ? Hi , I saw your " help wanted " sign .
 You 're hired . Come back tomorrow at noon for training .
 Thank you .


 You 're making me so wet .
 Here , feel .
 Yeah , it 's like a rainforest ,
 like a Slip 'N Slide . Yeah .
 Lick my pussy . Okay .
 Mm- hmm .
 Oh , God !
 I could come right now ! I 'm not gonna . Come up here .
 Come up here .
 Oh .
 I want to come with you inside me .
 - Whenever you 're ready , okay ? - Oh , okay . - I 'll do that .



 -
 Why are you watching this crap ? To not get a boner .
 Is it working ? So far .
 Is your penis doing okay ? It 's all right .

 All right , I 'm gonna go take a shower . No , you 're not .
 Huh ? Go take a look for yourself .
 - Frank ? - I assume so .
 - The other side , too ? - Yep .

 - Hey , V. - Hey .
 Hey , can I get a beer and a water ?
 Thank you .
 Starting to remind me of him .
 Lip !
 Hey , buddy , hey .
 - Hey , hey , hey , hey . - Going on ?
 Don 't be talking to strangers , son .
 Frank , Liam can 't be in here .
 Drinking age in my country is four ... and a half .
 That half really makes a difference . Fine , he can stay .
 But no booze , and we charge the same for sodas
 Ah , extra ...
 - For sodas . - Oh .
 Don 't be corrupting my son with your interracial , bisexual funny business .
 What do you want , Frank ? Two Cokes .
 Never thought I 'd hear that come out of your mouth .
 Well , being a good role model for my progeny is an important job , Kermit , unlike the bad influences he 's had up to this point .
 Hey , buddy , hi . You doing okay ?
 - I 'm having fun with Frank . - Well , of course you are .
 Well , if you need anything , you know how to call , yeah ?
 Mm- hmm .
 All right .
 Hey , want to have some real fun tonight ?
 What do you say you and me get some female company for tonight ?
 You can have your pick of the litter .
 Now , the important criteria to look for is who 's DTF , who 's holding weed or coke , and who makes your wee- wee tingle .
 Now go get the one you want .
 Oh , it 's a tiny dude !
 - Whoa !
 I 've got a date .
 - A lovely choice .
 - Hello . - Hello .
 Care to join us , Dollface ? Sure .

 How do you deal with it ... The taste and the folds and the slime ?
 What , uh , cheese dick and a throat full of spooge , that 's better ?
 Give me a beer .
 God !
 Man , if I sucked some guy 's dick , I wouldn 't be half as dramatic as you 're being right now .
 You 're a better man than I.
 You at least feel more worldly ? Not at all .
 I think it had steam coming off of it . Should I just get you the Drano , then ?
 If I knew I could gargle it , dude , without dying , I 'd say yes .
 You are 100 % gay . I have PTSD .
 It 's all over my boobs , too .
 What the hell happened here ? Did we get robbed ?
 - Kev . - Wake up . Hey .
 Oh .
 Hey , sexy . Hey , beautiful .
 - What is going on ? - This place is a disaster .
 You were supposed to clean today . Oh , sorry , I know .
 I got too busy , but we had a great day .
 Oh , my ... Did you know Gemma can climb up on the couch all by herself ?
 Your only job was to clean today .
 Really ? I thought I was supposed to keep the kids alive , too .
 We were at work all day , busting our butts . Yeah , all we ask is to come home to a clean house .
 I was working all day , too . Doing what , having a food fight ?
 - Did you even shower ? - Make us dinner ?
 Oh , my God , I 'm not a maid . Why are you two riding my ass ? Because you sat on that ass all day doing nothing .
 Oh , that 's exactly what I did today . Nothing .
 I did a heaping shit pile of absolutely nothing !
 - Uh , $328 ... - Are you kidding ...
 - No , wait , no , no ! Come on , not the front door .
 We have a special entrance .
 Whoa !
 Got a plan ? Yeah , of course there 's a plan .
 Oh , shit .
 - Let 's just ... - Okay .
 - Ladies first . - Okay . Oh , boy .
 - I 'll give you a boost . - Okay .
 - Liam , come on . - Okay .
 - Don 't fall , okay ? - Okay .
 Are you sure this thing is safe ? - Well , we 'll find out soon .
 - Okay . Liam , grab my ankles .
 Okay . Oh , yeah . Thank you .
 Jesus . Whoa . Frank , I 'm sorry .
 Holy shit .
 I had no idea our floor was so slanted .
 Ugh , it 'd be nice to have a toothbrush and a change of clothes .
 Yeah , I need a shower . My ass is numb from this chair .
 This couch is pretty comfy .
 Still not mad at Frank , huh ? I refuse to let him have any of my energy .
 - Dibs on the kitchen bathroom ! - Oh !
 Oh , shit , you ...
 - Shit ! We got to get upstairs .
 Yeah , we can throw a stink bomb up there if Liam weren 't with him .
 Put bars up on the window .

 - Hurry up in there ! - I 'm using the sink .
 Holy shit . Dude , that is a mangled mess .
 - Oh , my God . - Ugh , fuck .
 It 's all bloody and raw , man . You shouldn 't have gotten that stupid circumcision , man .
 All right , well , I did , and there 's nothing I can do about it now , so fuck you guys .
 I already feel like enough of a freak being the only Gallagher who 's not circumcised .
 Thanks for making me feel worse about it .
 What the hell ?

 Hey , kids . See those ladies over there ?
 They 're gonna help us clean the house so we can spend more time playing together .

 Eh , what the hell ?
 Yeah .
 Main 's off , and the outside spigot 's open .
 All right , hand me the hacksaw . Thanks .
 Let 's see how long he lasts up there without water .
 This is so fun , Harry . We have such a great life now .
 Double stroller ?
 We could get a lot for that .
 Pretty soon we 'll be able to start saving up for college .
 - Oh , no , it 's okay .
 You don 't have to go to college if you don 't want to , Harry .
 Shit !
 That smell could knock a buzzard off a gut wagon .
 Hey , Dollface , we got to hose you down .
 You 're riper than a fat boy in a clown costume .
 - Hey ! - I 'm sorry .
 Liam ... coffee on the hot plate .
 Oh , God damn it . I ...
 I hope it was recently flushed .
 Two raptors circling the nest .


 Nest is secured .
 What 's in the box ? New uniforms .
 - Oh , those are so cute ! - Oh , hell , no .
 - I am not exposing my legs . - Oh , come on .
 You 'll make more tips .
 Nobody sees my spider veins except my gyno and the neighbor with the binoculars .
 Don 't have to work here anymore . Fine .
 Bunch of us are going to Melody Lounge after work .
 - You should come . - Is that a club ?
 It 'll be fun . I don 't have a change of clothes .
 - Of course you do . - Yeah , right .
 Come on , you look fine .
 Hey , bring Lip , too .
 You know , the Feds showed up at my internship today . Yeah , took a couple of servers .
 What for ? No idea .
 But those nerds are richer than balls .
 I texted Caleb . Told him to meet me at the loft after work .
 Gonna compare vagina stories ? That 's exactly what we 're gonna do .
 There 's Carl .


 I 'm coming !
 - Shh !
 Gonna wake up the damn babies .
 You must be from the topless- maid company .
 You 're quick .
 - Can I come in ? - Yes . Yes .
 Let me show you around . As you can see , the place is a mess .
 I 'm gonna need you to do the laundry , wash the dishes , clean the floors , vacuum , and dust the furniture .
 Sound good ? Okay !
 Wow . Sorry .
 This is happening .
 Those are spectacular .
 It 's amazing how you stuffed them in there and now they 're out in all their glory .
 Hallelujah .
 What 's happening to me ? We gave you a jumbo dose of Thorazine .
 My brain feels like cotton candy . And that 's the way you 're gonna feel for the next 72 hours .
 No way you get a boner on that shit .
 Don 't have to think about hairy balls anymore .
 What ?
 You guys are the best .
 Wendy , don 't get me wrong . I like what 's going on here , but are you gonna be doing any cleaning today ?
 Cleaning ?
 You didn 't bring any Lysol or ... or ammonia or a mop or anything .
 You thought a topless maid service actually did cleaning ?
 Yes . That 's cute .
 Here . My services are à la carte . Pick what you like .
 - Mop and glow . - That 's one of my specialties .
 I 'm sure it is .
 - Pipe cleaning . - Old dudes like that one .
 Brazilian floor wax .
 That 's not what you think it is . I have no idea what I think that is .
 Sham wow ?
 Hey , you finally decided to come home .
 Did you trick me into having sex with a woman ? What ?
 So that you wouldn 't feel bad about what you did ?
 Look , what are you talking about ? You made me feel like a freak 'cause I 'm only gay .
 How you feel is on you .
 I slept with some random chick 'cause of you . I didn 't force you to do anything .
 I can still taste her hairspray and her pubes and her vagisitis .
 You obviously picked the wrong woman .
 Don 't turn this around on me . You 're the weirdo , all right ? Not me .
 Because I like to have sex with women once in a while ?
 - It 's not normal . - It 's very normal .
 Not if you 're gay , it 's not . It 's disgusting .
 Then don 't do it anymore . And it 's a turnoff .
 Me ? I 'm the turnoff ?
 You sleep with women ... yeah .
 Then why are we even going out ? I keep asking myself the same thing .
 - Judgmental much ? - Vagina- fucker much ?
 When did you become such a baby ? When did you become such a bisexual ?
 So that 's it , then .
 Yeah , I guess so .
 - Have a nice life . - Already am .
 Kevin , what are you doing ? I got a great idea for a business .
 - Where are babies ? - Sleeping .
 - Monitor . - Is the house clean ?
 That is a great question , which is directly related to my new business plan .
 - So , no ? - You are correct .
 The topless maid that I hired was more of an escort ...
 - You hired a topless maid ? - Did you have sex with her ?
 Of course not . What else did you think a topless- maid service did , Kev ?
 I was focused on the maid part and not the topless part , which gave me this idea .
 - Nooks and Fannies ? - Yes .
 We are gonna start a maid service that is not only topless but also cleans ; we 'll corner the market .
 You expect me to clean someone else 's house ?
 Don 't have to . That 's the genius part .
 You two are the boobs of the operation . She 's gonna do the cleaning .
 I think these girls just invited me so I 'd bring you .
 Hey !
 Oh . He 's ... he 's cute .
 Wait , wait , wait . Stop , stop , stop , stop .
 - Hi , Lip . - Hey , hi .
 Hi .
 What are you drinking ? Uh , beer .
 Okay . You want something , girl ? Uh , a change of clothes .
 You guys look great .
 Have a shot . It 'll make you feel sexier .
 Uh , two Stellas and three shots of Jager , on my tab .
 I saw you checking me out during my interview . That obvious ?
 But I liked it .
 - Oh . - Thanks .
 Cheers , boss . Thanks .
 Cheers .
 Ugh !
 - Let 's dance . - Yeah .
 Just so you know ... I have a kid and a stupid ex- boyfriend , so I 'm not looking for anything serious .
 Yeah , well , uh , I just got expelled from college and did 30 days in rehab , so ...
 Then we 're a perfect match .
 - Hey . - Yeah .
 Is that Ariel 's boyfriend ?
 No . She just met him on Tinder . Going to the bathroom to bang .
 - You on Tinder ? - Uh- uh . - Mm .
 Not into the meaningless , random hookup ?
 Uh , no , I 'm more of a " one dysfunctional relationship into another " kind of girl .
 - I 'm taking a break . - This is why you need Tinder .
 Give me your phone .
 You 're a hot piece of ass . You should be boning on the regs .
 - Let 's get you a picture . - I don 't know .
 They always seem to get attached . Or maybe that 's me .
 You bragging about your golden vagina ? No , more like my golden ability to pick liars .
 Then don 't talk to them . Just swipe , fuck , leave .
 Ooh .
 You already have three matches . And Luke is at the bar across the street , ready to rumble .

 Mm- hmm .
 Oh .
 What the fuck ?
 Everybody , wake up .
 - What 's going on ? - That !
 No ! Oh . Oh !
 Oh , shit ! Fuck .
 Don 't say Papa never gave you a pet .
 - Hey .
 Ugh !
 V !
 V !
 Where are you ?
 - Ah , V !
 - Hi . - What the hell are you doing ?
 - Can V come out and play ? - It 's 2 a . m .
 My kids , my husband and wife are sleeping .
 You know that that sounds weird , right ? You 're drunk .
 And fucked . I just Tinder- fucked ... this guy .
 His name is , like , a J or an L or some other letter . I don 't care .
 Careless , mindless sex has set me free .
 Tell me more about it tomorrow . This guy was doing this ...
 What the fuck ? Did you just close the door in my face ?
 - I found a pickax . - What the hell you doing ?
 - Looking for demolition tools . - Fiona ?
 - There 's a shovel in here . - She 's asleep .
 It 's me !
 Hey , I brought you some coffee . I figured you might be hungover .
 I am . What time is it ?
 Not as early as you ringing my doorbell last night .
 - Huh ? - Don 't " huh " me .
 - Yo , Fi . - Huh ?
 Pickax , sledgehammer . Sledgehammer .
 I 'll see you upstairs . I 'll be up in a minute .
 We 're getting rid of Frank .
 Ow .
 Who was this random guy you hooked up with last night ?
 Key word in that sentence is " random . " I don 't know .
 Why you sleeping with random dudes , anyway ?
 Why am I not hooking up with random dudes ?
 Some sort of rebound thing from Sean ?
 I 'd have to care for it to be a Sean- rebound thing .
 Funny . You said the same thing about Frank .
 Ooh . Having a rebound thing with Frank ?
 No , dummy . Caring .
 You seriously think that I give a fuck about Sean or Frank ?
 It 's been weeks , and you haven 't talked at all about what happened on your wedding day .
 ' Cause there 's nothing to talk about ... so I 'm not gonna talk about it ... ever .
 Look , it 's harder than I thought .
 - What the fuck ?
 Aah !
 Five , four , three , two , one .
 Okay , well , the 72 hours is up .
