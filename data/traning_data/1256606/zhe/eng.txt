 METRO NEWS 1
 Is your favorite brand of dental floss poisoning your entire family ?
 Tune in at 11 : 00 for the shocking ... tooth .
 Okay , I officially hate my job .
 I 'm not a reporter , I 'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people .
 I 'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter . " Bogeyman with a teleprompter . "
 That 's hilarious !
 Great joke , Robin , great joke .
 Barney , no offense to Robin , but that wasn 't that funny .
 Are you kidding ? That was a great joke .
 It 's smart , funny beautiful , the whole package .
 It 's everything you 're afraid to let yourself want .
 In a joke .
 " Bogeyman with a teleprompter . "
 Classic .
 Okay , what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7 : 22 in the morning ?
 I could tell you knew something was up with me , and you 're right . But I can 't tell you what it is .
 I should tell you , but I can 't ! I have to .
 I never will !
 I 'm going to . Let 's just drop it .
 What 's up with you ?

 Barney , just say it .

 I think I 'm in love with Robin . Hey , Lily needs some gift ideas for Stella 's wedding shower .
 Does she like to cook ?
 Um ... actually , I don 't know .
 Oh , what 's her favorite color ?

 Don 't know that either .
 Well , does she have any hobbies ?
 Yes , she 's exactly the kind of person who would have hobbies .
 And interests , too .
 I am one lucky son of a bitch .
 Dude , you don 't know anything about the woman you 're marrying .
 What ? You 're crazy !
 I know plenty .
 What color are her eyes ?

 The color of the ocean after a storm .
 Which is ?

 Beautiful .
 I DON 'T BELlEVE IT .
 I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your sex swing again , but you 're in love ?
 That is so sweet !
 It 's not " sweet
 It 's like a disease .
 I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings .
 I caught feelings bad .
 I used protection and everything .
 Oh , Barney , you don 't
 " catch " feelings , you just have them . And they 're good . They 're terrible !
 I can 't eat , I can 't sleep .
 She 's all I think about .
 I close my eyes , I see Robin .
 I , I hear a song ; it reminds me of Robin .
 - Morning . - I sleep with that chick ,
 I 'm thinking about Robin .
 Okay , so I don 't know every single detail about Stella .
 What 's this really about ?
 Do you not like her or something ?
 No , Ted , I like Stella a lot .
 She 's a Mets fan . - Really ?
 - It 's just that everything with you guys has moved so fast .
 You 've only known each other a few months .
 Don 't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit ?
 Get to know each other better ?
 I 'll have a whole lifetime to get to know her better .
 Right now , I know the one thing that I have to : that I love her .
 You love her ?
 Barney , how can you be in love , and still be sleeping with anything that moves ?
 I 'm sorry , I don 't follow you . That 's like saying , " How can an ant carry
 " 20 times its body weight , but root beer floats are still delicious ? "
 Are the two even related ?
 Really ?
 Ow !
 Barney , you 're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin 's boyfriend .
 " Boyfriend " ?
 I don 't want to be Robin 's boyfriend .
 Well , what do you want , then ?
 I don 't know .
 I just want to be with her .
 All the time .
 I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine .
 I want to hold her hand and smell her hair .
 But I don 't want to be her stupid boyfriend .
 Barney , what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend .
 And a pretty clingy one at that . Look , Lily , are you going to help me out with this or not ?

 I 'm a kindergarten teacher .
 I see a confused , little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors ,
 I gotta help the poor , little bastard . But only if you stop sleeping around .

 Deal ? Deal .

 Coming up next , is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels ?
 Stay tuned for the full ... scoop .
 Really ?

 - Uh- huh ...
 - Mmm ...
 I know dudes think it 's girlie for a guy to cook , but us ladies ?
 We find it mighty sexy . - Really ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 You know , uh ... my grandma taught me how .
 - Oh , yeah , she did . - Yeah .
 I had a lot of time after school to watch her cook because
 I wasn 't good at sports . I 'm on fire right now .

 Delicious .
 What 's in this pesto ?
 Oh , you know , the usual : basil , garlic , olive oil , but can you guess my secret ingredient ?
 - Peanuts . - Yes .
 How did you know that ?



 - Okay , let me think .
 What else ?
 - You know what , sweetie ?
 I woke up so early and I had a really long day at work .
 And then there was that whole thing where you tried to kill me .
 Can we please just go to sleep ?
 No , I clearly need to know more about you .
 Let 's do firsts . Um , first kiss ?
 Dale Harris , second grade .
 Wait , you 're talking like peck on the cheek or a full- on passionate making out ?
 - Passionate making out . - Okay , yeah , Dale Harris , second grade .
 Uh , first time you had sex .
 - Dale Harris , second ...
 - Stop it .
 Billy Devito , sophomore year of college . Prude .
 Molly McKenzie , junior year of high school .
 Slut .
 Robin just needs to see this new see of you .
 - So just call her up ? - Just call her up .


 It 's ...
 Hi , Robin .
 She wasn 't there .
 I left a voice mail .
 You left a voice , but it wasn 't male .

 Barney , I don 't get it . You 've called a million girls a million times .
 Yeah , but those were just booty calls .
 On a booty call , you barely even have to talk .
 9 : 03 PM Hey , baby , it 's Barney .
 You busy tonight ?
 Sweet .
 See you in half an hour ?
 Can 't wait .
 12 : 22 AM
 Barney . Busy ? Sweet .
 3 : 00 AM



 Sweet .
 A question mark ?
 You got laid off a question mark ?
 Ow !
 Hey !
 It 's no worse than your super- obvious code words . Rhinoceros . We have to go .
 Great . Now we need a new code word .
 Ah , ah , it 's her , it 's Robin .
 What do I do ? No- no- no- no , aah !
 Robin ... great to hear from you .
 To what do I owe the pleasure ?
 You called , went , and hung up .
 What do you want ?
 Help me !
 Uh , just ask her something .

 How are you feeling today ? Fine .

 Something personal .

 At what age did you first get your period ?
 Did you just ask me about about my period ? No , I did not .


 Look , Barney , I 'm at work right now .
 Just ask her out .
 Um , Robin , I was wondering if ...
 Nothing . Gotta go . Bye .
 Ha !
 That was just a practical joke .
 I 'm not really in love with Robin .
 You should 've seen the look on your face .
 There 's cameras right there and there and there .
 Ah !
 What a legendary prank that we 're never going to speak of again . PM 19 : 47 : 00
 Gross .
 Uh , first movie you ever saw .

 I watched it recently with Lucy and I just thought ,
 What about you ?
 My dad took me to an old drive- in


 Ted , the only people in the universe who haven 't seen
 and that 's 'cause they lived them , Ted !
 You 've got to calm down .
 I told you .
 I told you you didn 't know this girl well enough .
 What if you show it to her and she doesn 't like it ?
 Dude , it 's just a movie .
 and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important .
 It 's like , it 's a test of how compatible you guys are .
 Marshall , it 's just a movie .

 121 AWESOME MlNUTES LATER
 Okay , if Stella doesn 't like this movie , - I can 't marry her .
 - No , you can 't . - You want to watch it again ?
 - Yes , I do .

 Wait , where are the boys ?
 I thought this was a group thing .
 Yeah , I lied .
 They 're not coming and I 'm about to leave .
 - Why ?
 - Because ... they 're not in love with Robin , and neither am I.
 I mean , she 's great and sweet .
 I 'm not going to pretend that I hen 't noticed her body , but this is off topic .
 Good luck . Wait , wait , I can 't do this .
 She 'll never take me seriously .
 - She thinks I 'm some womanizing idiot .
 - Hey .
 We both know you 're more than that .
 Okay , just show Robin the Barney I met the other day .
 You mean the insecure , touchy- feely she- male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted ?
 Hey , Ted hit that for over a year .
 Wish me luck .
 I just thought it 'd be fun to watch a movie tonight ,
 I figured why not ? No big deal . It 's pretty good .
 - Sounds like a plan .
 - Hmm .

 Hey , I 'm just gonna grab a beer .
 - You want one ?
 - Um ... the movie 's already started , so ...
 Yeah , it 's just some words flying through space . I mean , I 'm not going to read that anyway .
 Oh , my God
 Off to a bad start .
 What are you doing down there ?
 I 'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman .
 That 's what I 'm doing . Dude , what the hell are you doing , hiding behind the couch ?
 You need to get a job .

 I really do , don 't I ? Yeah .
 So , Robin . tell me about your day , and not just what happened , how you felt about what happened .
 What ? I 'm not looking to problem- solve ,
 I 'm just looking to listen .
 Why are you acting like this ?
 Like what ?
 You 're being super nice .
 It 's freaking me out .
 Be gross , be inappropriate .
 - Be Barney . - Uh ,
 I 'm being Barney , and I think tonight 's going to be de - wait for it - lightful .
 Delightful .
 Right .
 Hey , um , so I went to the chiropractor yesterday .
 That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour .
 Is insurance going to cover that ?
 Sometimes they don 't .
 That 's it ?
 Okay .
 Well , um , today I was at the dentist .
 That guy drilled me all day long .
 He drilled me hard .
 He filled all of my cavities .
 Come on , man . Well , your teeth look fantastic .
 Who are you ?

 What ?
 Nothing .
 You were staring at me .

 You look really beautiful tonight .
 You don 't look so bad yourself , mister .
 Yeah , great scene , great scene .

 George Lucas based the film 's structure
 Uh , he also owes a debt to Joseph Campbell 's work with comparative mythology .
 Yeah , Ted , I 'm losing wood over here .
 What 's going on ?
 Nothing .
 Wait , it 's really important to you that I like this movie , isn 't it ?
 No .
 Well, I 'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time .
 Go to your room and I will come get you when it 's over . - Stella .
 - Go .

 Should I leave , too ?
 What part , what part , what part ?


 Thanks .
 Nothing ? Not even a glance ?
 I mean , even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys .
 What the hell is wrong with you , Barney ?
 I don 't always want to be that guy .
 Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with .
 Now, tell me something about you that I don 't know yet .
 Seriously . Okay .
 Um ... there 's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me - completely legit world news , interviews with people who matter - uh , but I decided I 'm not going to apply .

 Why not ? Because I 'm a joke .
 I 'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel .
 Hey , we both know you 're more than that .
 Promise me you 'll apply . Barney , it 's not as easy ...
 Promise me you 'll apply .
 Okay .
 I promise .

 Okay , she 's up to the scene where Luke , Leia ,
 Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star 's trash compactor .


 Okay , we should have just heard ...


 ... but Stella didn 't make a peep .
 - I 'm gonna take a look . - All right .

 She 's not even watching .
 She 's texting .
 I 'll tell her you still want to be friends .
 I don 't believe this .
 I don 't believe this ; she knows this is important to me .
 She 's blatantly ...



 " Stop watching me , jackasses . "
 To taking chances .
 You know , Robin , there 's actually something I ,
 I do want to talk to you about . - Last call . - Of course it is .
 One more for the road ?
 Yeah , why not ?
 Hold that thought ?




 I will .

 I loved it .
 Yes !
 Yes , I am marrying a woman who is not only hot
 That 's the dream . Yes
 What was that ?
 I was high- fiving 15- Year- Old Me through the space - time continuum .

 We did it . We did it , you masturbating little bastard .
 Champagne for everybody .
 It was so good .
 - You hated it , didn 't you ?
 - Ugh , it 's so stupid .
 I mean , first of all , how do they understand that walking ... bear they hang around with all the time ?

 - Wookiee . - Yeah , he goes ...

 And they 're all like ,
 " That 's a good point , Bear , let 's try that . " Okay , he 's a Wookiee , and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear .
 Look , Stella , that is Ted 's favorite movie of all time .
 He watches it when he 's home sick with the flu .
 He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall .
 He ... he watches it on Christmas Eve .

 Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life ?

 I do .
 Well , then , Ted 's a lucky guy .

 Bear .
 - Hey .
 - Hey .
 So , here 's the deal .
 April , have ... you met Barney ?
 Hi , Barney .
 - Uh , hello .
 - April just finished her shift , and she 's looking to blow off some steam .
 - Ha . - Hmm . Would you excuse us for one sec ?
 What are you doing ?
 Well , you were so nice to me tonight ,
 I wanted to return the favor , wingwoman- style .
 So , as I was saying , April , Barney ... is the Yankees ' new second- baseman .
 And Barney , April asked if tomorrow , you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match .
 You can 't make this stuff up .
 So , you two kids have fun .
 So are you , uh , nervous about the game ?
 Yeah , I 'm nervous for the other team
 ' cause when I step up to that plate ...
 Look , April , I am not a New York Yankee .
 Any other night , I would probably try to convince you that I am , but I 'm not .
 I 'm just some guy who 's in love with the girl that just left , and she 's never going to feel the same way .
 So I 'm just going to go .
 And that was it . I 'm so sorry , Barney .

 But you can 't give up .
 You know , it may take some time , but once Robin really sees the new you ...
 Barney , um , when my family gets to Yankee Stadium , are the tickets under your name or mine ?
 My name , and tell your nephews to bring their mitts .
 They 're going to be in foul ball country .
 Come on .
 Okay , well , the Robin stuff was completely true .
 Damn it , Barney .
 I mean , for the last time , and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet .
 You have to choose right now .
 I choose bimbos . - What ? !
 - Hey , Lily , bimbos make me happy .
 Bimbos make me feel alive .
 Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man .
 This whole thing with Robin was just a fling , but at the end of the day , my heart belongs to bimbos .
 No , no , this is just a defense mechanism because you 're afraid of getting hurt .
 You 're just confused .
 Oh , I 'm not confused , Lily .
 You know who is confused ? Bimbos .

 They 're easily confused .
 It 's one of the thousand little things
 I love about them .
 I love their vacant , trusting stares ; their sluggish , unencumbered minds ; their unresolved daddy issues .
 I love them , Lily , and they love me .
 Bimbos have always been there for me , through thick and thin .
 Mostly thin . B - man don 't do thick crust .
 What up ?
 See you , Barney .
