 Woman over walkie- talkie :
 They 're coming up on vinton and 20th now ... Check over that way , would you ?

 Man over walkie- talkie :

 I 'm about 5 out .
 You see a guy in a corduroy coat go by ?
 Sir ?
 Sir .
 Young guy , dark hair , corduroy coat .

 How about it ?


 Hey , Nick .
 Come here .

 Wanna come on out here ?

 Go ahead and open your jacket for me .

 I 'm placing you under arrest , sir .
 Put your hands on your head , please .
 Nick , you want to grab those for me ?
 Nick :
 You got it .

 All right , let 's go .
 Nice job .
 Say nothing , you understand ? !

 Sam :
 Hey , gene . Raquel :
 Nice lunch ?
 Oh , yeah . Whatcha need ?
 Rolls about to come out .
 You got it .



 Jimmy :
 So , can I , uh , tell Howard you 're not quitting or retiring or whatever ?
 And can we take all this shit down off the walls ?
 I 'm gonna go call Howard .
 Jimmy .
 You do realize you just confessed to a felony ?
 I guess .
 But you feel better , right ?
 Besides , it 's your word against mine .
 Ohh !
 Ugh !

 Jimmy :
 Absolutely .
 Coming back .
 What 's it matter what I said , Howard ?
 Why you lookin ' a gift horse in the mouth ?
 He just -- yeah , well , whatever it was , he 's over it now , all right ?
 And by the way , you 're welcome .

 Well , Howard 's breathing again .
 You made him very happy .


 Jimmy !
 Jimmy , if you 're gonna help , a- at least use a little finesse , would you ?

 " Finesse " ? Whaddya ...
 Would -- quit yanking at it .
 You 're -- you 're pulling the varnish right off the walnut .
 Not pullin ' any varnish off the walnut .
 You most certainly are . Look .
 Look ! See ?
 Well , maybe you shoulda thought about the friggin ' walnut before you covered it in duct tape .
 I don 't need your help !
 I don 't recall ever asking for it .
 I 'm sorry , okay ?
 Finesse , fine .
 Show me .
 Demonstrate .
 Like this .
 Gently ... ... roll it with your thumbs .
 Left , and then right . See ?
 Alternate the thumbs , up and down .
 Get a nice , tight roll going .
 Chuck , i think you 're the one that needs a nice , tight roll .

 Come on .
 Show me .
 Gently .
 Gently .
 Left , then right .
 Left , right .
 I get it .
 Wax on , wax off .
 Mr. miyagi .
 " Karate kid . "
 Seriously ?

 Oh , my god .
 " The adventures of Mabel . "
 I- i haven 't thought about this in forever .
 You remember this , Chuck ? I do .
 Harry thurston peck .
 Yeah !
 Mabel goes into the mountain , and she meets the king of the brownies , and he gives her ...
 Some kind of super delicious jelly and ...

 Holy crap .
 1912 .
 Yeah .
 Belonged to grammie Davenport .
 She wrote her name in it .
 She was reading that to her schoolkids the year the Titanic went down .
 Damn .
 And mom read it to me .
 read it to you .
 You don 't remember .
 Yeah , yeah . I do , now that you say it .
 Yeah .
 What was I -- like 5 or 6 ?
 You had this weird night- light that you were so crazy about .
 It was , um ...
 It was daffy duck !
 It was some daffy duck rip- off with this weird red bill .
 Mouth . Oh , yeah , yeah , the bill . Yeah .
 Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah .
 And it used to get so hot , we thought it would burn the house down , but -- Right . ... You wouldn 't let anybody touch it .
 Yeah , that 's a -- you got a great memory , Chuck .
 That red bill and everything .
 Hey .
 What was the name of that little girl that lived , uh , three houses up from us ?
 She had , like , a pageboy haircut .
 Jimmy .
 And she was always in the dirt , always dirty .
 Jimmy !
 I liked her . She was always -- Jimmy .
 Don 't think I 'll ever forget what happened here today .

 And you pay .

 You didn 't mention my garden .
 Well , your garden is part of your backyard , so it 's automatically included in the property that goes to jenn .
 It comes with the house , mom .
 Well , I think you need to mention it by name in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks .
 Okay , we can do that .

 Let 's see .
 Garden .

 Hey , I 'm back .
 Oh , hi , ladies .
 Jimmy mcgill .
 Hey , Jimmy . We are almost done here . Great .
 Can I , uh ...
 We 're almost done .
 I 'll be with you in a minute .
 Oh .
 And mention my Lily pond .
 It 's in my garden .
 Lily pond .


 Kim :
 Okay , ladies . Jenn :
 Thanks so much for your help .
 Oh , you 're very welcome .
 Thank you both for being so patient .
 And , Mrs. aherne , if you or Margaret ever need anything from me -- anything at all -- you can call me day or night .

 This is Mrs. siemasko and her daughter jenn .
 I 'm sorry .
 I got my wires crossed a little .
 Uh ...
 Bye .
 Mrs. siemasko :
 Bye .
 Drive safe .
 Thank you . Okay , thank you .
 You are a superhero .
 I owe you big- time .


 So , how 's Chuck ?
 Crisis averted ... I guess .
 I mean , he 's back to being the same old Chuck , so ...
 Wanna talk about it ?
 Depends .
 It may or may not involve that thing you said you never , ever wanted to discuss .
 Um .
 Okay , then , thanks . I gotta get back to it .
 How 'bout we call it a day ?
 I 'll buy you some dinner .
 You 're kidding , right ?
 You realize how far behind I am ?
 Not to mention now I 've got eight entire wills to finish up .
 Whaddya talking about ?
 I 'll do the wills .
 No , you won 't .
 ' Course I will . Do the wills .
 They 're clients .
 They 're clients . You and I aren 't partners , remember ?
 Once I take these people on ,
 I can 't just reassign them to you .
 Aw , c 'mon .
 Why you getting all , like , legal on me , huh ?
 Who cares ?
 Look , I told every single one of them the situation -- that they 'd be getting me instead of you .
 I tried to talk them all into coming back another day .
 Six of 'em left . Maybe you 'll get those back .
 I mean , look , if this is about the money , I have -- it 's not about the money .
 You can keep the money .
 Don 't act like I this .
 Jesus , like I need more on my plate .

 Are you mad ?
 I 'm not mad .
 I 'm just , uh ... ... thinking about things .

 For 10 minutes today , Chuck didn 't hate me .
 I forgot what that felt like .

 Chuck :

 Jimmy :


 That 's the end of it .
 Howard ?
 That 's the end .
 Mm .

 Could you ... ?
 Oh , yeah .
 Well , now do you believe me ?
 I don 't even know where to begin .
 But yes , i believe you .
 Your brother is one world- class son of a bitch .
 No offense .
 I just -- I really wish you 'd told me about these plans of yours before you went out and did it .
 I know , Howard , and I regret misleading you .
 It 's just that a certain ... had to be established .
 I 'm not talking about the heart attack that you nearly gave me .
 Chuck , this tape -- I 'm not sure exactly what it accomplishes .
 Look , you know evidentiary rules better than I do , but a secretly recorded tape with a problematic chain of evidence ?

 You 're gonna have a helluva time getting that admitted .
 I agree .
 And if you somehow put it in front of a jury ,
 Jimmy 'd call a dozen audio experts , say that voice isn 't his , say the -- the tape had been edited .
 He would , indeed .
 Are you thinking about playing this for Kevin wachtell at mesa verde ?
 Because as much as I would love to , that ship has sailed .
 We 're never getting them back , regardless . Oh , I doubt we could even get in the door over there .
 Chuck , if that tape is useless in a court of law and no help in the court of public opinion , what 's the point ?
 Because I can 't think of a single use for it .
 can .



 hey , mister , we 're closin ' in 15 minutes .

 Call me a cab , will ya ?

 What about your vehicle ?
 Keep it .
 Man : Five j 's auto salvage .
 Broadway , uh , at -- at Bobby foster 's .
 Yeah , ehr -- ehr -- ehr -- how is it again ?
 Ehrmantraut . Yeah , ehrmantraut .
 Yeah .
 Just tell him to pull up to the gate and honk .
 Okay , yeah .
 Thanks .
 They 're on their way .
 Thank you .

 Now , you 're sure i can 't help you carry those to your car , Mrs. vankamp ?
 Don 't be a silly .
 I only hope I didn 't take too much of your time with all my dusty old photos .
 Goodness , no . Your -- your grandson 's wedding was gorgeous .
 When I come back ,
 I 'll show you my niece 's confirmation .
 Wait 'll you see the flowers !
 Ohh ! Roses .
 Uh- huh . Petunias , orchids .
 Yeah . They don 't smell , you know ?
 Well ... And baby 's breath and bachelor buttons .

 Okay .
 Lilies of the valley .
 Well , I 'll believe it when I see it .
 Daisies -- daisies don 't tell .
 Now I 've got something to look forward to . Okay . Okay , bye- bye .
 Bye . See ya !
 Uh , thank you for waiting so patiently .
 Who do we have next ?
 That 'd be me .

 Hello , hello .
 It 's so good to see you again .
 I escorted you and your clients onto my base .
 I treated you with hospitality and respect , and now i come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie .

 Captain , please . Why don 't -- sit down . Take a load off .
 Hey , I 'll get you a complimentary coffee or a soft drink ?
 And your so- called war hero , " fudge " talbott ? No such person -- never was .
 Granted , some artistic license may have been taken .
 You entered government property under false pretenses , sir . Whoa , whoa .
 I am no expert on your procedures and your protocols and whatnot , so if -- if we failed to cross a " t " or dot an " i , "
 I sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding .
 N- no , no , no , it 's not a misunderstanding !
 Just step back !
 B- big picture this , okay ? !
 It -- what damage was done ? !
 Hey , who was hurt , huh ?
 What was damaged ?
 The -- the base is still there , right ?
 The b- 52 is , i presume , still -- b- 29 .
 Huh ? B- 29 . Fifi 's a b- 29 .

 I don 't ...
 Oh , this is all just one big joke to you , huh ?
 You don 't like the commercial .
 No , no , I don 't , but this has nothing to do with the comm -- well , constructive criticism is always welcome .
 But I didn 't -- but you should realize that most people find it uplifting -- patriotic , even .
 No . You check your recruiting numbers .
 I- i- i -- i think you 're gonna see an uptick , and you know what ?
 If it turns out that fudge wasn 't actually in the war -- fudge is not a person .
 He in the war .
 Well , neither was tom cruise , and look what " top gun " did for you .
 You lied to me , you lied to my face , and I can 't let you get away with it .
 I- i think we just -- we 're just gonna have to agree to disagree , so , uh , can I get you that coffee to go or ... ?
 No , no .
 gonna tell what 's happening now .
 You 're gonna take that ad off the air .
 And if you play that ad one more time ,
 I 'm gonna go to the judge advocate , and we will take you down -- trespassing , false representation , stolen valor -- the whole nine yards .
 Seriously , for eight seconds of a TV commercial ?
 You take that ad down , or there 'll be hell to pay .
 That clear enough for you ?

 Make me .
 Yeah ? Yeah . Make you ?
 Yeah , let 's do this .
 You bring your commander down here , and I 'll explain to him how you let us on the base , red- carpet treatment .
 No , b- because you lied your way in . Not how i remember it .
 What happened -- and I 've got witnesses to back me up .
 Do you like being an air force captain , huh ?
 You think the United States wants to bring action against an old man in a wheelchair ? !
 He was standing on TV .
 He wasn 't even in a wheelchair ! Well , yeah .
 Well , periodically , he is .
 And when he shows up in court , you better believe he 'll be in a wheelchair !
 Right , because you 're an ambulance- chasing piece of shit ,
 ' cause you 're all the same -- you 're the same as all the others .
 Always on a high horse .
 Always trying to make me feel like I 'm --


 look , um , I 'm a lawyer , and this is what I do all day , every day , so h- how about this ?

 I- i won 't fly jet planes -- you , uh , stay out of court .
 Does that sound good ?
 You know , guys like you -- you think you 're so damn smart , and you think you don 't have to play straight with anybody .

 The wheel is gonna turn .
 It always does .


 " A lawyer you can trust . "
 My ass !
 Thank you for your service !



 3 : 30 in the morning ?
 Seriously ?
 You get me that ?
 I don 't know .
 It 's a real thing ?
 Yeah . Then , yeah .
 I know someone who can get it .
 How much ? What do I look like -- radioshack ?
 It 's gonna cost you whatever it costs me , plus my end . Well , let 's start with that .
 Normally , be about $500 , but seeing that this is an after- hours house call ,
 let 's make it a grand .



 Hey , how 's the pup ?
 Doing okay ?
 Yeah .
 She 's not being left alone all day , is she ?
 She 's got plenty of company .
 Good .
 Hey , uh , this is gonna take me a few days , so I 'll let you know .
 And next time ,
 let 's try to make business happen during business hours .

 Mm- hmm .
 Well , this will certainly help my Thursday powerpoint .
 Excellent .

 That 's a draft letter from Kevin to the Arizona regulator .
 I know he likes the personal touch .
 He 's gonna love it .
 Oh , I can 't believe you did all of this in three days .
 Am I reading this right -- did you get the rehearing moved up ?
 Yeah .
 Those are three possible dates , pending your and Kevin 's schedule .
 The soonest I could get is the 4th .
 You moved it up almost three weeks .
 I 'll give it another shot and see if I can do better .
 Are you kidding me ? Kevin 'll be popping champagne !


 I knew you were the right one for this .
 Well , I appreciate the opportunity .
 Yeah , you should have heard how that arrogant jerk spoke to me at the hearing .
 Right there , in front of Kevin , he accuses me of muddying the waters -- muddying ... The ... Waters .
 I mean , he 's the one who can 't even get the address right .
 Yeah , that 's -- wow .
 I know you have friends over at hhm , and they sure talk a good game , but come on .
 Guys like that , when crunch time comes , it 's always someone else 's fault .

 Paige ?
 I 'm sorry to interrupt .
 It 's almost 11 : 30 . Thanks , Greta .
 I 'll be right up .
 So , are we still on for lunch Tuesday ?
 Kim : Absolutely .
 And , Paige , thank you ... For everything .
 Paige :
 No , thank you for cleaning up that mess mcgill left behind .
 Actually , would you mind if I messenger that over tomorrow morning , first thing ?
 I 'd like to take one last look before we submit , just double- check a few things .
 Sure .
 So , tomorrow , first thing ?
 Absolutely .
 Thanks .
 I 'll see you , Paige .
 Okay , bye .
 [ Telephone ringing in distance ,


 How 's it coming in there ?
 Good !
 Don 't mean to rush ya .
 No , it 's okay .
 I 'm done .




 Half a rainbow ?
 Don 't you want to keep going till you do the whole thing ? No .
 If you 're done , I 'm done .
 You know , your clients seem to like that rainbow .
 Think they 're gonna miss it ?
 Wait till they see what 's going up next .
 They 're gonna love it .
 gonna love it . Yeah ?
 Should I be worried ?
 Nope .
 Whaddya say we get the hell outta here ?
 Sounds good .
 Mm .




 You ready ta hit it ?
 Sorry .
 I just need to check one thing .
 It 'll be two minutes , tops .






 Chuck :
 Ernesto .
 Morning , Mr. mcgill .
 They didn 't have fuji apples , so I got you honeycrisp .
 Hope that 's all right .
 I 'm sure it 'll be fine .
 Um , did you get the , uh ...
 Yeah .
 I got them .
 I went ahead and , um --
 I figured i should maybe ...


 I wrapped them up -- you know , for safety .
 That 's very thoughtful of you , but I need them now , so , if you ...
 You sure it 's okay ?
 It 's okay .

 Um .
 Yip .

 Perfect .
 Ah .
 Shit !
 Ahh .
 Ernesto , could you come in here , please ?



 Thought i could do this myself .
 Uh , would you mind , uh , changing the batteries ?
 Sure thing , Mr. mcgill .
 Yeah .
 Thanks .



 Jimmy :

 turn it off !
 Turn that off !
 Turn it off !
 Jimmy :
 Aah !
 You did not hear that !
 All right .
 Okay , Ernesto ...
 That 'sss my fault , not yours .
 Um , but now that you 've heard it , you need to understand something .
 You know about confidentiality , right ?
 As employees of Hamlin , Hamlin , mcgill , you and I are both bound by the strictures of client confidentiality -- by law , both of us -- by law .
 You understand what I 'm saying ?
 So I 'm not supposed to tell anyone ?
 That 's right , no matter who , no matter what reasons you think you might have , you must not -- you tell anyone .
 There could be terrible consequences -- life- changing consequences .

 And we don 't want you to get into trouble .
 If something were to happen to you because of this ,
 I 'd feel sick about it .
 Okay .
 Enough said .
 I guess ...
 I 'll go finish puttin ' away the groceries .
 Okay ?
 Thank you , Ernesto .








 Hmm .
