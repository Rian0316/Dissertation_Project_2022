 00 : 00 : 03, 023 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 864 Should you really be sitting in Sheldon 's spot ? ( groans )
 He 's in Texas . He 'll never know .
 I wouldn 't be so sure about that .
 Yeah , he has a very sensitive butt .
 Well , it 's true .
 Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up .
 Have you heard from Howard ?
 I did . His talk at NASA went great .
 Sheldon didn 't heckle him ?
 No , in fact , he was so well- behaved ,
 Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream .
 ( knocking on door )
 Hey , guys .
 Oh , hi . - Hi , Stewart . Hey , Stewart !
 How 's it going ? Good .
 Sheldon 's out of town , so we can do whatever we want .
 We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn 't like .
 Oh , how is it ?
 Disgusting . Do not tell him .
 What do you guys want to do tonight ?
 I don 't know .
 Well , I told Howie if I wasn 't busy , I 'd spend the night at his mom 's .
 So for God 's sake , think of something .
 ( Stuart coughing )
 Stuart ? Are you okay ?
 No , I don 't feel so ...
 Oh , Stuart ?
 Stuart ?
 Oh , my God , you guys need to do something !
 Stuart ?
 Calling 911 . Well , it 's too late .
 What do you mean it 's too late ?
 He 's been murdered by someone in this room .
 ( dramatic music plays ) Oh , my God .
 Oh , come on !
 Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner .
 I 'm leaving .
 You can 't leave .
 You 're a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom .
 ( dramatic music plays )
 I didn 't know his last name was Bloom . Yeah , it 's Bloom .
 Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night ?
 What do you think I was gonna do at home ?

 Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents ?
 " Lame characters with silly ac ... "
 What kind of actress are you ?

 You 're right , I 'm sorry .
 It ... sounds like fun .
 Thank you .
 That kind of actress . This sucks !

 Come on , guys .
 Raj put a lot of effort into this .
 And that 's great .
 It 's not sad , it 's great .
 I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight .
 Actually , you 're all just gonna be yourselves . Oh ... ugh .
 All right , if I 'm doing this ,
 I 'm playing to win , so just to be clear :
 If we 're ourselves , that means one of us killed Stuart ?
 Very good , Bernadette . You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi .
 What is that , like , the Indian Sherlock Holmes ?
 Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi ?
 According to Wikipedia , Sherlock Holmes came first .
 Great , everyone 's a Byomkesh Bakshi .
 Now ... here are some secret facts about each of you , including whether you are the murderer .
 Throughout the game , feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues .
 Got it .
 Hey ... who 's the murderer ?
 Any question but that .
 Sorry .
 Hey ... who 's the murderer ?
 Bernadette , can you not stand so close to me ?
 What do you care ?
 You 're dead .
 Suit yourself .
 But I can kind of ... see up your skirt .

 Thank you for my bobble head .
 Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech .
 It wasn 't easy .
 Was it Buzz ?
 We can 't show up to your mom 's empty- handed .
 We should bring something .
 I already am .
 I 'm bringing the gift of knowledge . Oh , boy .
 Despite what her Bible says , recent archeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament , they didn 't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later .
 I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie .
 But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful .


 So , what happens next ? I can 't tell you that .
 But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment .
 Ooh , I 'm gonna check the fridge , and see if there are any clues inside a beer .
 Hey , I- I found something .
 It looks like a little man with a briefcase . Oh , no , no .
 That 's Clarence Darrow .
 It 's from a game Sheldon made up called
 You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system .
 Well , unlike that , my games are much more fun .
 Okay , can I ask you something ? Why do you like making us do this stuff ?
 Well , I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India , and didn 't have any friends .
 I didn 't know you were fat .
 Yeah , I was ...
 I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school . Kids were mean .
 Cows may be sacred there , but it doesn 't help if you look like one .
 Anyway , I was pretty lonely , so I had to make up my own stories and games , and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that ... that I would play those games with them .
 That is so sweet .
 I 've seen old pictures of you .
 You were never a fat kid . No , I was svelte as a gazelle .
 A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling .
 ( dramatic music plays )

 Hey , what about this ? It looks like a receipt .
 What 's it for ? For a cup of coffee .
 But it 's dated 20 years from now .
 From the future ? !
 How fun and imaginative .
 So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart ?
 Correct .
 Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he 's just ripping off
 Does the smart- ass know that was actually ripped off from an script called
 by Harlan Ellison ?
 Oh , does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison , it was not ripped off from but was ripped off from another script he wrote called
 I 'm gonna need another clue .

 Okay ... give me the flowers and pie .
 But if we show up and you 're holding them , she 'll think they 're only from you .
 They are only from me .
 You said the gift of you was enough .
 Yes ... but now that I 've seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like , there 's no going back .
 Boy , I can 't wait to see the look on her face ...
 We 're leaving right now .
 What 's wrong ? Nothing . What ?
 Sheldon , tell me what 's going on !
 I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again .



 You ready to talk about it ?
 I 'm not nearly drunk enough . Okay .

 Do you have any idea what it 's like to see your mother ravaging someone ?
 Does a brisket count ?

 I 'm sorry , buddy , that 's rough .
 But didn 't she know we were coming ?
 No . I wanted to surprise her .
 What am I supposed to say to her after something like this ?
 Well , did she see you in the window ? No .
 Then don 't say anything . I have to .
 How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don 't tell her how disappointed I am , and that I 'll never forgive her ?
 Well , don 't do it on the phone .
 No , I 'm just going to tell her I 'm coming so she can give that Good Time Charlie the heave- ho .
 That 's some tough talk .
 I may need to cut you off . Yeah , maybe you better .
 I took a pretty big sip .
 Look , she 's a grown woman .
 And- and your dad 's been gone a long time .
 Maybe this is none of your business .
 I beg to differ .
 I used to live in those genitals .
 And if someone wants to move into my old room , I should at least get a vote .
 KOOTHRAPPALl :
 Okay , murder suspects ,
 Leonard has found the time machine the killer must 've used .
 You 're all inside it , and we hurtle through the very fabric of time .
 ( electronic sound effects playing )
 And welcome to 20 years in the future .
 Hey , you guys just time- traveled .
 Stop looking so bored .
 Well , my beer isn 't flat and my rack 's not saggy .
 So far , the future 's great .
 Hey , can I go to the bathroom ? Fine , just try not to look too alive .
 That 's my jam .

 So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart ? But why ?
 Perhaps this will help .
 Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue .
 Hey , I- I won the Nobel Prize in physiology .
 Then I used the money to buy Stuart 's comic book store , and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me .
 Not the worst idea .
 Hey , I 'm a famous actress living in London . Hmm !
 I 'm a professor at Stanford . Hmm ! So I guess you two are making it work long distance .
 KOOTHRAPPALl : Oh , no .
 In this game , as your careers both took off , you drifted apart .
 Kind of like how future me
 lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled , but still flexible , Madonna .
 What does your card say , Bernadette ? LEONARD : Eh , eh , eh , hang on .
 Do- do you think we 'd really drift apart if we both became successful ?
 Of course not .
 If I became a famous actress and had to move , you would just come with me . But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor ,
 I might not have that much choice in where I end up .
 Yeah , but if I become a successful actress , we wouldn 't need the money .
 Well , you don 't go into science for the money .
 Speak for yourself .
 Last month , my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome . Ka- ching , ya blinky chumps .
 So , wait , if my career took me somewhere else , you might not go ?
 Well ... ( sings dramatic stinger ) He started it .
 Okay , okay , guys -- new back stories .
 Uh , Penny and Leonard , you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York .
 Uh , you 're an actress , you 're a professor and you have three beautiful kids .
 Great . Really ?
 You think I 'm putting this body through three kids ?
 Okay , let 's do this .
 Good luck .
 You ...
 Aren 't you gonna come with me ?
 While you confront your mother about her sex life ?
 I 'd rather go back to that bar in ass- less chaps .

 Mother ?
 Mother .
 Mother ? Shelly !
 I 'm so glad you 're here !
 I saw you having naked sex .
 What are you talking about ?
 Earlier , I came here to surprise you .
 I looked in the window and I saw you with a man . Oh , Shelly , I 'm so sorry . Come in .
 Um ...
 Maybe we should sit down and talk about this .
 Can you recommend a surface you haven 't had coitus on ?

 That 's not funny .
 Maybe we should sit at the table .

 Well , I 'm sure that , uh , you ... have a lot of questions .
 Who was he ?
 His name is Ron . I met him at my prayer group .
 How long have you been involved with him ?
 A few months .
 And of those few months , how long have you been a demented sex pervert ?

 That is no way to speak to your mother .
 Perhaps not .
 But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life , and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen 's finest sofas .
 I will give you one opportunity , young man , to apologize .
 Or what ? Or I will send you to your room .
 That 's ridiculous .
 I am a grown man . I am a professional scientist .
 And I currently occupy the moral high ground .
 Go to your room .
 But I occupy the moral high ground .
 Go to your room .
 But I 'm a professional scientist .
 Go ... to your room !


 I 'm a grown man . Can we please get back to the game ?
 I- I- In a minute .
 I- I- I don 't understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science .
 Okay , if you do something cool in science , you might change the world .
 If I become a famous actress ...
 I 'm not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best .
 They just are . I 'm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff .
 Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out ?
 Actually , our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios , including career changes , financial instability , intelligent dog uprising ...
 FYl , we plan on selling out the human race hard .

 In 20 years , who knows what 'll happen with any of us ?
 I think you and Leonard will be together .
 You do ? Yeah .
 I think you 're the best couple I know . Aw . That 's so sweet .
 What the hell ? ! Excuse me ? Ah- da- da- da- da !
 Let the dead man talk . So , why do you think that ?
 Uh , well , I feel like you guys make each other better .
 Penny brought Leonard out of his shell .
 And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world .
 I don 't know .
 Together , you two kind of make one awesome person .
 Aw , Stuart .
 Now I feel bad for murdering you .
 Oh , come on !
 Penny did it !
 I win !
 Suck it , jackasses !

 ( knocking on door )
 Hey , can I come in ?
 Apparently any man is welcome in this house .
 Why not you ?
 I thought you were waiting in the car .
 That was an hour ago , Sheldon . A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long ,
 " For Sale " signs start to go up .

 I take it things didn 't go smoothly with your mom . No .
 I 'm not sure how we 're going to get past this .
 You know , I ...
 I sort of went through something
 like this myself .
 Howard , we 've all seen your mother naked . That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe .
 I 'm talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple years after my dad left .
 I didn 't know she did .
 Yeah , she was dating this guy , and I was kind of a jerk to her about it .
 What did you do ?
 Well , let 's just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El .
 Anyway , she broke up with him . And she 's basically been alone ever since .
 She never said it , but I always felt
 I was the reason why . I 'm sorry . Although , based on your story , you absolutely were the reason why .
 All I 'm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom 's happiness .
 You may have a point .
 I love my mother .
 Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel .
 And the healing begins .

 Hello .
 Hello .
 Are you ready to discuss this calmly , like adults ?
 I am .


 Shelly , I 'm sorry that you saw what you saw .
 I know that this is hard for you .
 I think what most upsets me about it , Mother , is the hypocrisy .
 Doesn 't this contradict all the religious rules you 've been espousing your whole life ?
 You 're right , it does , and it 's something that I 'm struggling with these days .
 Then why are you doing it ?
 Because I 'm not perfect , Shelly .
 And that man 's booty is .

 Well , this is confusing for me .
 But I don 't want to stand in the way of your happiness .
 So ...
 I 'll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance .
 That is very Christian of you .
 Mother , if you 're going to conduct your life in this fashion , then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman .
 You know , it 's not all sock hops , soda jerks and segregation anymore .
 How old do you think I am ?
 My point is that you 're going to need to be careful .
 You used to be protected by your pre- Enlightenment mythology , but now you 're going to need a stronger friend named latex .
 Are you having the sex talk with me ?
 Well , someone has to .
 Oh , dear Lord !
 Yeah , well ...
 No , don 't look to Him . He 's mad at you right now .



 Oh , come on , don 't pout .
 I 'm sorry I ruined your game .
 I 'm not pouting , I 'm brooding .
 Which is how sexy men pout .

 It actually was kind of fun .
 You 're just saying that .
 Yeah .
 I liked the time travel element .
 Thank you . I thought it was inspired . It was .
 By
 Well , I hope 20 years from now , we really are all still together and still friends . Definitely . Of course .
 Well , hey , how about this ?
 Whether we 're friends , not friends , scattered around the world , no matter what ,
 let 's all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8 : 00 p . m . and have dinner like we always do .
 PENNY :
 Aw !
 I love it .
 Okay ?
 Putting it in my phone right now .
 Yeah , me , too .
 My phone doesn 't have a calendar .

 It 's all right , I 'll just write it on my hand .
 And it 's done . Yup , we 're all in .
 All right , I 'll see you guys in 20 years .
 I knew it .
