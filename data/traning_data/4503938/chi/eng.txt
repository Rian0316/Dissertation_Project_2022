 00 : 00 : 03, 636 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 837 Miss ? I have to apologize .
 Well , not to me , but I 'm sure the Amish are pissed that you 're gaying up their look .
 I don 't have enough money for the tip .
 Weird .
 You survive the diner chili , and it 's the waitress that kills you !
 But I can tip another way .
 I 'm a psychic .
 So , uh , you already know where they 're gonna find your body .
 Oh , please .
 I die in a bridge collapse you have nothing to do with .
 I can tell you your future .
 Ha ! You 're wrong .
 I don 't have one .
 See the guy in the booth over there ?
 Jared " Leto Himself Go " ?

 He just offered to read my future as my tip !
 Ha !
 You don 't have one .
 Miss , let me read your palm .
 Sir , coming over here right now is not a good idea .
 We don 't like to be stiffed by strangers .
 In six months , maybe , but we 're not there yet .
 I 'm a legit psychic .
 I predicted long hair was coming back in time to have long hair when it did .
 Okay .
 You can read my palm .
 I could use some good news .
 I could also use some hand moisturizer ... sorry .
 I see two Ms ?
 You bitch !
 Have you been holding out on M& M 's ?
 Ooh !
 Is it the male model
 I 'm managing who 's also making it with Max ?
 Actually ...
 I see a small failure .
 I take it back .
 You are good !
 ( Peter Bjorn and John ) ♪ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ♪ [ cash register bell dings ]
 Subtitle sync and corrections by awaqeded for www . addic7ed . com . Here 's your chocolate lemon crumble .

 Sounds like it shouldn 't work together , but it does .
 It 's the Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga of desserts .
 Max , can I have just a wee bite ?
 A crumble of the crumble ?
 Caroline won 't let me eat anything because of my big photo shoot .
 [ sighs ]
 Hurry !
 No chewing , no enjoying .
 Just swallow .
 Spit that out !
 No !
 I said spit that out !
 You 're a model now !
 Shame on you !
 Bitch , he 's starving .
 He 's not eating , is he ?
 I don 't want the Stay Puft Marshmallow man showing up at my girlfriend 's photo shoot .
 I haven 't eaten anything since Tuesday !
 This morning , he tried to swallow his toothpaste , but I was right there to stop him .
 Good , honey .
 That kind of heartlessness is why I 've decided to make you the manager of our hot new location of the High .
 Oh , my God !
 This is so exciting !
 Someone 's finally realizing my full potential , and it 's not me !
 Will I be able to make Max head pastry chef ?
 And where is this new location ?
 Well , right now , everything 's under wraps the way my face was six months ago .
 But as manager , you can hire your own staff , and I 'll even let you poach Max .
 I 'll also tell you the new spot is amazing .
 It 's international .
 It 's a hub .
 I 'm talking major flagship .
 Honey , I get that you 're happy , but enough with the eye contact .
 No one can look me in the eye .
 I 'm the Medusa in Chanel .

 Max doesn 't let me look her in the eyes during sex either .
 I told you , eye contact 's extra .
 Max , did you hear that ?
 Major flagship !
 Uh , did someone just call me a major flag ?
 I think you did , and if I don 't get to go to the new place with you two ,
 I 'm telling HR .
 That 's Hector Rodriguez , my therapist .
 Would you be interested in coming to the new High as part of our team ?
 If you say " part of our team " again ,
 I 'll rethink the whole thing .
 I 'll take it .
 But I have to be upfront with Max .
 I don 't like it in the back .
 Which , by the way , is what I say to all my dates .
 Samesies !
 Well , this is great news .
 How about we celebrate with a piece of pie ?
 No !
 Earl , we have great news .
 Guess what it is .
 No , don 't .
 Okay , guess .
 No , don 't .
 Yes , guess , guess !
 Can we hurry this along ?
 My cousin is on today , and I wanna find out if he 's the father .
 ' Cause then I can stop paying child support .
 Sorry .
 She 's a little amped .
 She hasn 't had good news to share since we found out the washing machine in our basement takes buttons .

 Sure , you do .
 And I 'm playing center for the New York Knicks !
 Have you seen the Knicks lately ?
 He can only help .
 Well , according to my time card ,
 I 've been here for six hours already , so I 'm gonna head back and catch some Zs .
 The Mattress is all yours , Max .
 Hey , everybody .
 We weren 't expecting company .
 I came by to discuss wedding details with Oleg while we had intercourse .
 What is this , the Bunny Ranch ?
 Baby , I think these are yours .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Why , thank you , honey .
 Can we just make it a general rule that there 's no fornication in the diner ?
 Or in Han 's apartment , ever .
 Okay , Max and I have some really exciting news .
 Yeah , yeah .
 We know all about the buttons .
 Oleg !
 I think you crushed my seating arrangement !
 I 'd like to think so .
 So , back to us .
 How 'bout back to work ?
 Max and I ...
 Need to do some work !
 There .
 End of news .
 Where are you running off to so fast ?
 Is someone having a sale on smaller heads ?
 I 'm too small , I 'm too big ... pick one !
 Here 's our big news .
 You are looking at the manager and the head pastry chef of the brand- new High location .
 Actually , he 's looking at our kneecaps .
 Okay , so we 're going with too small .
 If you two quit the diner , how will I ever replace you ?
 Unless I hire ... literally anyone else !
 No , Han , we still have to work here at night .
 We have more debt than Jada Pinkett- Smith has excuses for Will not being home .
 But at the new High , we 're gonna be the big bosses calling all the shots .
 Yes , yes ... by day .
 But by night , you 'll be the coleslaw 's bitch .
 Don 't listen to him .
 Clearly , Han just resents our success .
 I know !
 Why can 't women ever just be happy for each other ?
 Wow , that is really hot .
 Yeah .
 The milder salsa 's right here .
 Listen ... oh !
 Do girls eat now ?
 Wow !
 Lena Dunham changed everything !
 Listen , which one of you is sleeping with the model ?
 I know one of you said you were , but I don 't listen when you talk .
 [ muffled ] She is .
 This is a massive ad campaign , and I don 't know how else to say this , but I need his penis to look bigger .
 Oh !
 Yeah ...
 It gets nervous when you shine a light on it .
 Sometimes I hear her coaxing it out of its crawl space with treats .
 Well , do something .
 I haven 't touched one since college , and even then it was just to look under it for my keys .
 Max , take him off set .
 Be professional .
 How professional can I be ?
 She 's asking me to fluff his nutter .
 Yo , Nash !
 Break time .
 So ...
 Marie .
 Did Joe tell you about my big new job promotion ?
 Of course she did .
 We 're lesbians .
 Talking is most of what we do .
 It 's why we rule daytime .
 ( Irish accent ) Eh ... pardon me .
 You , maybe .
 That coat ... never .
 I 'm lookin ' for someone .
 You also look like an extra from
 But this is a private shoot , as in we 're shooting someone 's privates .
 I 'm looking for me son .
 Okay , people !
 The groundhog 's outta the hole !
 Six more inches of winter .
 That 's him !
 That 's me boy !
 Ma ?
 Huh ?
 Ma , how did you know I was in New York ?
 Aw , no , you saw me in the window , didn 't ya ?
 You checked into " America " on Facebook , you bleedin ' idiot .
 I flew all the way and been lookin ' for you day and night in this dirty , God forsaken city for a week .
 I 'm takin ' you home .
 Ma 'am , Nash can make his own decisions .
 He 's a grown man .
 Yep .
 Thanks to my handiwork .
 He 's no grown man .
 He 's just now 18 .
 He 's got his prom next month !
 I can 't believe it !
 I had sex with a teenager !
 Who am I , Woody Allen ?
 Roman Polanski ?
 Pretty much any of your big- time '70s movie directors ?
 You had sex with me innocent child ?
 Uh , not so innocent .
 He made me blush a few times , and I have two positions named after me .
 Well , that 's that .
 You 've seen the last of big booby dirty girl here .
 I 'd object , but when you 're right , you 're right .
 But Ma , I like New York .
 People want to take pictures of me willy here .
 This is all me fault .
 I should have never let you watch that
 That 's great .
 I don 't have a model now .
 I 'm Seal .
 Wait until I tell Joe about this .
 How can you not know how old he is ?
 Uh ... what can I say ?
 We 're a typical couple !
 He lied about his age , and I pretended he was interesting .
 Okay , Max , when Joe gets here ,
 I 'm just gonna tell her that me managing an underage twink has nothing to do with me managing her restaurant which sells overpriced twink ... ies .

 Yeah .
 I 'm sure she 'll be professional about it all .
 Professional ?
 Yesterday , she slapped a woman in here for wearing cheap heels .
 I know .
 My face is still red .
 Here she is .
 Good morning , Joe !
 Hey , ladies .
 Well , obviously , you 're both fired .
 Obviously .
 Can I keep the hat ?
 You are not gonna want this back .
 My head sweats like a watermelon at a picnic .
 Please don 't fire us over the Nash situation .
 It was out of our hands .
 Actually , it was in her hands , and it was only 18 .
 You two embarrassed my girlfriend .
 And embarrassment in the lesbian community is worse than not owning a dog .
 It 's worse than dating Anne Heche .
 Oh , my God .
 We committed a Heche crime .
 How can we make it better ?
 Just get that kid back to the photo shoot tomorrow , and we 're back in business .
 And Max , next time , stay out of his barely legal business .
 Done .
 Don 't know how , but done .
 You won 't be sorry .
 Just get him back , ' cause I gotta tell ya ...
 Marie 's crying face ?
 Not for me .
 Well , coleslaw ... just when I thought I was out , you pulled me back in again .

 Max , don 't tell the coleslaw that .
 Don 't give it that power .
 My plan to get Nash back will work .
 We still have a bright , bright future .
 Yes !
 By day .
 Han !
 Do you want to spend another night in this coleslaw bucket ?
 And had I not been able to roll myself out to the street ,
 No .
 I might have suffocated !
 Nash and his mom will be here any minute , Max .
 Do you really need to expose 60 % of your boobs ?
 It 's not up to me .
 These girls have a life of their own .
 The right one just started a Fleetwood Mac cover band .
 You know how I know ?
 ' Cause when I take my bra off , it goes its own way .

 Do you really think you can get Nash 's mother to change her mind when they come in to pick up the rest of his stuff ?
 Yes , I do .
 Because she and I have a lot in common .
 I may not be Irish , but I 'm dirt poor , and I 'm living with someone who drinks way too much .
 ( Oleg ) Max , look .
 All those purple post- its are Sophie 's friends and family .
 My family 's nowhere to be seen !
 It 's like I 'm looking at the last U. S. census !
 Hey , girls .
 Come over here .
 We need your help with the seating chart .
 You know , planning a wedding is more work than waxing Oleg 's back during a full moon .
 Yeah .
 Sophie , I have my own issue right now .
 Then Max can help me with the chart while you go worry about your obviously thinning hair .
 Okay .
 Uh , full disclosure ... the last time someone asked me to help them with something ,
 I free- based half their beard off .
 [ chime ]
 I just got a text from Nash .
 He 's here ?
 I 'll go get him a kid 's menu .
 They 're not coming .
 His mom found the racy pictures I sent him .
 " Flying out of JFK tomorrow .
 Taking the morning Aer Lingus " ?
 A little morning " Aer Lingus " ?
 Isn 't that what got Max in trouble in the first place ?
 Okay , well , we just have to go to the airport and stop them .
 I 'll buy us plane tickets and then return them ,
 like I do with shoes or Tom Cruise does with wives .
 Jackets and shoes off !
 And make sure you check all your pockets .
 Don 't make me shut this airport down for a piece of gum .
 This line is longer than the movie
 What does TSA stand for ?
 " Time Stands A- still "
 That 's cute .
 Never heard that one before .
 Most people just go with " This Sucks Ass . "
 Max , please don 't yell out again .
 People get very jumpy in airports .
 Oh , what ?
 It 's not like I screamed , " I have a bomb "
 Miss , will you step over here , please ?
 Oh , I was kidding .
 I don 't have a bomb .
 But I have been known to ... be DA bomb .
 Max !
 Please , please , if we step away , we 'll lose our place in line .
 I know it sounds like we 're here to blow up a plane , but we 're really just here to stop an underage kid she had sex with from leaving the country .
 So I should just come over there now .
 You just been hand- picked to join the " I don 't trust you " dance party .
 Yep .
 May I see your tickets ?
 We 're allowed to be creative from the neck up . Nice day .
 I like your hair .
 Thanks .


 Ooh !
 You traveling to Paris .
 First- class .
 In those jeans ?
 You got first- class tickets to Paris ?
 Are you insane ?
 My fingers did it .
 It was rich girl cellular memory .
 And if we 're not going anywhere , why can 't we not go to Paris ?
 And why can 't we not go to the Louvre ?
 And why can 't we not stay in the penthouse
 Is it too late for me to say I don 't know her ?
 Ma 'am , are you carrying any explosives ?
 I had leftover Chipotle for breakfast .
 Does that count ?
 It does to whoever 's sitting next to you .
 ( woman , French accent ) Air France flight 113 will now begin boarding at gate 24 .
 Max !
 That 's our flight .
 ( bad French accent ) Air France , flight 113 .
 Ooh !
 I bet on the plane , they 'll have caviar and Bellinis .
 You know what won 't be on the plane ?
 Us !
 We 're not going !
 Have you been smoking the half joint
 I have hidden in my bra ?
 You have a joint ?
 Bank account ?
 Ha !
 You went through security with pot ?
 I went through third grade with pot .
 There he is .
 There 's Nash .
 I 'm sure his mom is asking if he can visit the cockpit and meet the pilot .
 Wow .
 He 's young .
 So young , Bruce Jenner has been a woman for most of his life .
 Nash !
 Please .
 You can 't go .
 Our entire lives depend on you finishing that photo shoot .
 Nash Terrence O 'Brien , you 're not going anywhere .
 Or I 'll take you over my knee right here .
 Well , he likes that .
 Well , you ...
 You are just loose as a goose , aren 't ya ?
 Again ... when you 're right , you 're right .
 Max , let me talk to Mrs. O 'Brien .
 Go up to the gate .
 Ask what movie they 're showing on their flight .
 Okay , but if they 're showing anything , and I mean from Mr. Adam Sandler ...

 I 'm getting on the plane too .
 Please .
 I 'm begging you .
 You don 't know me .
 I 'm a proud woman .
 The only other time I ever begged was to get off of P. Diddy 's yacht .
 I mean , a party shouldn 't be three days long .
 Miss , you can save your silly breath .
 I 'm taking him home .
 Would passenger Maeve O 'Brien please report to the gate desk ?
 Oh , Nash , maybe they 're bumping us up from the last coach row to the second to the last coach row !
 I knew I 'd be rewarded for not having any abortions in spite of me circumstances .
 Grab Nash ... let 's get out of here while I got her distracted .
 Max , you did that ?
 How ?
 I no longer have the half a joint in my bra .
 You bribed an airline employee with a joint ?
 Pain ?
 Oh , you really gotta stretch out for that .
 Max , this is kidnapping .
 Oh , he 's not that young .
 When I was his age ,
 I had already robbed three Blockbuster videos .
 What 's Blockbuster video ?
 Oh , my God , I screwed a baby .
 I 'm gonna text Joe and tell her we have Nash in our custody . Okay .
 No , I 'd better call .
 That text won 't play well at our trial .
 I 'm sorry I didn 't tell ya I was so young .
 But honestly , I didn 't think it mattered since you 're so immature .
 I know you are , but what am I ?
 Okay , so Joe was really impressed with the kidnapping , and she gave us our jobs back .
 But Nash , you 've been replaced .
 They found another model who wouldn 't give them any parent trouble ... a well- hung orphan .
 A well- hung orphan .
 Well , the Lord gives and the Lord takes .
 So what now ?
 Well , you go back to Ireland and brag to your friends about having sex with someone who once had sex with Axl Rose 's best friend 's son .


 Good- bye , Max .
 Later , Nash Potater .
 You know , I think I 'm gonna miss him .
 Especially since kids eat free at Quiznos before 6 : 00 .
 Ugh ! Let 's get out of here .
 The only good thing about airports is leaving them for someplace better .
 Max , next time we 're here , I 'm gonna take you to Paris .
 Well , first take me to the bathroom .
 I 've had to pee since our tram hit that pothole .
 Well , at least we 're gonna be working somewhere with class .
 I wonder where it is .
 Joe said it 's a real hub , flagship , international .
 Yeah .
 It 's gonna be international terminal 8 !
 What ?
 Here ?
 We 're working here ?
 I 've got to find out who I brutally murdered in a previous life and make it up to him or her .
 This sucks !
 The one place no one will give us a ride to work !
 ( female announcer ) Final boarding for Air France , flight 113 .
 Of course it is .
 Look at the bright side .
 These days , most planes don 't even make it to where they 're supposed to go .
 ( announcer ) Paging first- class passengers Caroline Channing and Max Black .
 Those rich bitches are so lucky !
