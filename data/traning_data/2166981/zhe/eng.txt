 00 : 00 : 00, 200 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 280 You know , one of the downsides to a life of crime is that occasionally you have to do business with people who are , um ...
 Well , for want of a better word , criminals .
 Like most things that end with you hanging upside down in a deserted warehouse , it started with a really good idea .
 " A Small Cat ln The Garden was painted by Pablo Picasso in 1903 ,
 " in what was known as his Blue Period .
 " It measures 12 inches by 11 inches and was stolen from a private collection
 " in the early hours of Sunday morning . " Mmmm ...
 Value ?

 - It 's been insured for 3 million .
 - Wow .
 " Police say the gang was clearly experienced and well informed . "
 - Meaning it was stolen to order . - No question .

 - Is Mad Dolly still around ?
 - My thoughts exactly .

 - Who ?
 - Dolly Hammond , she 's the best Picasso forger in London .
 She 's all right , but she 's just a bit ....
 She 's ... unique .
 Yeah , she 's a bit different , you know . - Insane .
 - Yeah .
 - Nice .
 She 's a lovely old bird really , but , erm ... she used to have the hots for Albie .
 Why would we need someone to forge a painting that 's already been stolen ?
 Well , because now its theft has already been reported ...
 Collectors will believe you if you tell 'em you 're trying to sell it .
 It 's brilliant !
 - Yes , it is .
 - Yes , it is .
 - As always .
 Well , potentially brilliant .
 Depending on who you try and sell the fake to .
 And here 's a little tip should you ever find yourself trying to flog a fake Picasso ...
 Don 't try and sell it to the bloke who the original was nicked from in the first place .
 Aye- aye .
 Here come the cavalry .
 Ash !
 Gently , Sean , gently !
 Oooh ...
 - Where 's Mickey ?
 - They pulled a gun on us .
 - Petre Sava 's men have taken him .
 - What happened ?
 Well , it 's a very long story , but the upshot is the original was nicked from him in the first place .
 He wasn 't happy at us telling him it was us who nicked it , and then trying to sell him a fake back instead of the real thing .

 This is not Picasso !
 This is not my painting !
 So Petre Sava is holding on to Mickey till we deliver the real Picasso back to him .
 We haven 't got the real one .
 No , I did mention that , and we argued for a bit , then he threatened a level of physical violence
 I wasn 't comfortable with , so I backed down .
 He 's given us six hours to find it .
 So what happens if we can 't find the real painting ?
 Oh , he was very specific about that . Mickey 's a dead man .
 sync and corrections by Bellows www . addic7ed . com
 So no- one 's got anything ?
 - But that 's impossible .
 - Well , it 's not a local crew . Someone would know if it was .
 By now the real painting could 've been shipped out of the country .
 Yeah , but , come on , it 's weird that no- one 's heard anything . Or if they have , they don 't want to share it .
 What about that Dolly the forger ? Would she know ?
 If she 's a Picasso freak , she might have heard something .
 I suppose ...
 - Yeah .
 Yeah , yeah , it 's worth a try .
 - Let 's do it .
 Can 't find a decent thief these days , they 're all gangsters , they 've got no class .
 - Not like you Albert . - Thank you , Dolly .
 I 'd string 'em all up .
 By the testicles .
 Leave them there for the crows to pick at .
 Feed what 's left to the pigs , like we used to .
 So you 've no idea who stole the Picasso , Dolly ?
 - What Picasso ?
 - A Small Cat ln The Garden .
 You 've had your copy , I 've already done it .
 No , no , I 'm talking about the real one .
 He 's cute .
 Dolly , the painting , have you any idea who nicked it ?
 How would I know that ?
 - Has no- one said anything to you ?
 - Who ? - Anyone .
 - Said what ?
 - About the painting .
 - What painting ?
 - The Picasso .
 - I don 't know who nicked it .
 - Well , that 's what I 'm asking , innit ?
 - I 've told you . Who are you ?



 Oh ...
 I 'm Emma .
 What are you doing in my house ?
 I 'm with Albert .
 This your floozy , is it ?
 No , no , no , no .
 You 're the only woman for me , Dolly .
 Ohhh !
 Aah ... unlucky .
 Dolly , do you know anything at all about the painting ?
 Anything that might help us find out who nicked it ?
 I mean , was there someone who really liked it ?
 A private collector ?
 Or did someone try and buy it before and failed ? Anything .
 I know where every Picasso in London is .
 I can smell them .
 Except this one .
 Dolly , look , is there any way you can track it down , you know ?
 I mean , what 's the word on the street ?
 Do I look like Huggy Bear ?
 Dolly !
 We need to find it .
 I 'll see what I can do , if ... .. he sings to me , and he snogs me .

 ♪ Hello Dolly , well , Hello Dolly ♪ It 's so nice to have you back where you belong ! ♪
 SHE LAUGHS
 Oh ...
 HE CLEARS HlS THROAT No .
 Forget it .
 It 's ... it 's not happening .
 Sean , think about Mickey .
 - ( Forget Mickey . ) - ( Do it . ) - I don 't want to ... - Do it .

 - Don 't want to !
 - Sean ...

 Well ?
 Erm ... well , I should know in a couple of hours .

 Now , just in case Dolly draws a blank , we 'd better cover all the angles .
 Albert , use your police contacts , see if they 've got any leads
 - on the robbery or any idea who it was .
 - Right .
 - Sean , take the car .
 See what else you can find out about Petre Sava .
 - OK .
 - What about us ?
 - You and me will go and see Cyclops .
 Now , art 's not really his thing , but he might have heard something .

 I 've got The Dogs Playing Snooker , if that 's any good to you ?
 It 's a classic .
 I used to have The Bird On The Tennis Court Scratching Her Bum , but it got stiletto damage in a domestic dispute .
 - Well , women don 't really get art , do they ?
 - Is that right ?
 Yeah , well- known fact .
 They 've got no patience for it .
 That 's why all the major artists are all men .
 Women would never be able to finish anything .
 They 'd be halfway through The Laughing Cavalier , then they 'd wander off and start colour- coding their shoe cupboard .
 Look , can we get back to the matter in hand ?
 - Which was ?
 - A Small Cat ln The Garden .
 - The stolen Picasso .
 - Oh , yeah .


 So who nicked it ?
 - Art 's not really my thing .
 - I said that , didn 't I ?
 - Yeah .
 - But I heard about it .
 - What ? - I said I heard about it .
 - No , no , no , what did you hear ?
 - That it was nicked .
 You want a chip ?
 - No .
 Thank you .
 - Any chance of a date ? - None .
 Sympathy shag ?
 Think of it as charity work , it 's been a while .
 Look , Cyclops , Mickey 's in trouble .
 Whatever you know , you need to tell me .
 - We haven 't haggled yet .
 - What ?
 You 're going to charge us ?
 ' Scuse me .
 This is still a capitalist society .
 I thought Mickey was your mate .
 Well , he 's more of an acquaintance , really .
 But that said , I 'm willing to make a discount .
 How much ?
 Call it a nifty .
 OK .
 I can 't tell if these things are related , but the day before the Picasso was nicked , a hardcore jock crew flew in .
 Scottish ?
 The McCrary brothers .
 They took over a house in Westbridge Grove .
 Now , all I know about ' em is that they nick to order , anything you like , usually upmarket .
 Paintings , cars , antiques ...
 I mean they could be here for something else , but ...
 It 's worth asking the question , innit ?
 OK .
 What do you think ?
 Well , we could knock on the door , say " Och , aye , the noo , " and ask 'em if they 've just nicked a Picasso .
 It 's direct .
 But as we don 't know who they are ,
 I think it 's a little bit foolhardy .
 Yeah , I know , that 's what I like about it .
 Ash ?
 DOOR BUZZER
 - 'Who is it ? '
 - It 's Ash Morgan , I need to talk to you about the Picasso you just nicked .
 - Have you lost your marbles ?
 - Yeah .
 We haven 't got much time .
 What 's the worst that could happen ?
 They could kill us !
 Yeah , well , then at least Mickey would know we died trying .

 - You 've got some bottle .
 - Yeah , well , needs must , and all of that .
 Well , in you come , then . That 's very kind , but if it 's all the same to you ,
 - we 'll stay out here . - Fair play .
 The trouble is , a very good friend of mine is being held by Petre Sava , the bloke you nicked the Picasso from .
 Now , it 's a long story , but now he thinks we got it .

 - And why would he think that ?
 - Because we told him we did . Yeah .
 We were trying to sell him a fake .
 - We 're grifters . - Yeah .
 It 's what we do .
 We read about the Picasso being nicked , so we had a copy made to sell to a private collector , one who wouldn 't ask too many questions .
 If they 'd read about it being stolen , they 'd believe it was real . Exactly .
 Trouble is , the collector we took it to , it was paid to Sava , who was the one you 'd nicked it from .
 Which he wasn 't very happy about , as you can imagine .
 It 's a beautiful story , and I 'm getting all misty- eyed , but what 's any this got to do with us ?
 Well , err ...
 If you give us the real Picasso , the one that you nicked from Sava , we can go and get our mate back .
 Well , let 's just say that we had this painting , not that I 'm saying that we do , you understand ...
 But he 's your friend , not ours .
 So what 's in it for us ?
 Well , to be honest , I haven 't thought that bit through .
 What do you want ?
 Don 't want anything .
 I tell you what , 20 grand and I 'll nick it straight back for you .
 You know , just for the sheer brass neck of you ,
 I 'm tempted to help you out .
 And I do love a grifter .
 Especially a pretty one .
 - But it 's already been moved on .
 - Where ?
 - Oh , I can 't tell you that .
 - You have to . - Ash , is it ?
 - Yeah .
 Ash .
 I can 't do it , son .
 We 've worked years to build up a reputation based on complete discretion .
 I can 't piss that up the wall for a couple of grifters .
 So my lips are sealed .
 All right , what about if I threatened to beat it out of you ?
 Then I would respect that .
 And me and my brother Neil here , would defend ourselves as best we could , by ripping your head from the rest of your body and eating it .
 Fair enough , just asking .
 You have a nice day .
 So , looks like we 're back to square one .
 - No , not exactly , now we know who stole it .
 - Yeah , but not who for .
 - We still don 't know where it is .
 - Any news from the Old Bill , Albert ?
 It seems we know more than they do .
 What if the McCrary brothers haven 't delivered it yet ?
 We could just watch the house and wait for them to make a move , right ?
 What if they 're delivering it tomorrow or next week ?
 We 've only got four hours left .
 What about Petre Sava ?
 Well , I did some digging about , like you said .
 Mickey was right about him being a high- end art collector .
 His private collection would rival most European galleries .
 The last we knew , he owned half a dozen nightclubs in London , so he was bound to be a bit dodgy .
 - Well , that 's a good thing .
 - Yeah . Until you find out how dodgy .


 - Human trafficking ... - Aah . - .. Class A drug distribution , and a protection racket that started in Romania , and has now spread over eight European cities .

 We need to get Mickey out of there .
 So what did you do with the black guy ?
 He 's in the boot of my car .
 - Can he breathe ?
 - Sure .
 At least I think so .
 If they don 't bring me my painting ... .. you think we should kill him , or just cut some bits off ?

 Or both ?
 Both is good .
 They don 't cut people up too much in the West , you know .
 They don 't kill them very much , either .
 They " beat up " .
 But if you just " beat up , " they get better , they find some friends , and then they come back .
 If you cut bits off and post them to their friends , this doesn 't happen .
 No .
 It 's more efficient .
 Exactly .
 So , both it is .
 You cut ... .. I kill .
 THUMPlNG
 - Where 's Mickey ?
 - He 's being held hostage by a Romanian gangster who won 't release him until we find a painting of a cat in a garden .
 Yeah , right , yeah .

 It was horrible .
 - So , did you actually have to ?
 - I don 't want to talk about it .
 Oh ...
 No , of course not .
 She took her teeth out .
 SNORTS
 So , did she say anything at all ?
 Take a deep breath , Sean .
 It might help to make the pictures go away .
 Petre Sava bought A Small Cat ln The Garden by Picasso at an auction in Kensington .
 He outbid a private collector called Matthew Fairchild , who 's an investment banker , and happens to be the father of Louise Fairchild , whose married name is Holmes .
 Should we know her ?
 No , but you might 've heard of her husband .
 - Harry Holmes !
 - The Harry Holmes ?
 ' Fraid so .
 It 's all right .
 It 's all right , calm down .
 Calm down .
 Now , I understand you 're not a grass ... .. and I admire that in a man , I really do .
 I need you to open up for me .
 One way ... or another .
 When Harry Holmes found out it was Petre Sava who beat his father- in- law to the painting ,
 - he wasn 't happy . It hurt his pride a bit .
 - I bet it did .
 I heard he was like a dog with two whatsits when he married into the upper classes .
 He 's always fancied hunting , shooting and fishing .
 So the painting 's about impressing
 - the new in- laws ?
 - Seems like it .
 Then maybe those in- laws are one of the reasons that Harry hasn 't got his own hands dirty in order to get the painting back .
 He paid the McCrary brothers to steal it for him instead .
 - That 's what Dolly said . - And you 're sure that wasn 't just pillow talk ?


 So on one side we 've got a violent Eastern European gangster , and on the other , a homicidal maniac ?
 - That 's about the strength of it .
 - So what shall we do ?
 Sensible thing would be call the Old Bill , tell 'em what happened and throw ourselves on their mercy .
 - We 're not going to do that , right ?
 - No .
 Which leaves us with one other option .
 Which is ?
 To steal the painting back from Harry Holmes .
 This is the home of Matthew Fairchild , father- in- law of Harry Holmes , who paid the McCrery brothers to steal the Picasso from Petre Sava .
 I still can 't believe you got it back .
 It 's family , innit ?
 I know someone who 's getting a special treat later .
 Now Fairchild 's already a collector , so the security is a bit nifty .
 - That 's comforting .
 - Yes , they got CCTV , weight sensor pads , motion detectors , heat imaging systems and laser webs .
 That 's if you can get past the two killer dogs in the grounds .
 I hate dogs .
 Luckily , although the system 's state of the art , it was designed by Fairchild himself .

 How does that help us ?
 Systems like this are only as good as their design , and he 's made a very common , but simple mistake .
 - Which is ?

 - Basically it 's a domestic system , and like most domestic alarm systems , it 's designed on the assumption that a theft would take place either when the place is empty or at night under cover of darkness .


 Which means when they 're home during the day , the alarms are switched off .
 - Exactly , Albert .
 - Because who would be stupid enough to break into a house in broad daylight when everyone 's at home ?
 ' OK , so this is all about timing .
 ' Everything on cue , like a ballet .
 ' Firstly , let 's make sure the dogs get their sleeping pills .
 ' They 'll last about 20 minutes . '
 Three , two , one .
 ' Dogs are asleep . I 'm moving into position . '

 Albert , you set ?
 Ready .
 Emma ?
 Sean ?
 Ready .
 - Ready . - 'OK . '
 Go !
 POLlCE SlREN APPROACHES
 Hello , madam . We 're investigating a stolen painting .
 What are you doing ?
 We need to search the property .
 What 's going on ?

 I don 't know .
 I 've got your number , fella !
 I 'll be straight onto the station !
 But I think we should get out of here .
 Yeah .
 I 'm with you .
 No , look !

 Don 't you tell me to calm down !
 All right , thanks , Nigel , don 't forget I owe you a big cigar .
 A good one ?
 Yeah , thanks , bye , bye .
 All right , the police have been tipped off , they 've seized the painting and they 've arrested Harry Holmes .
 - Is that good or bad ?
 - Well , it can 't be good , can it ?
 Wait !
 That 's exactly what it is .
 - How ?
 - If the police have it , Sava was the rightful owner .
 They 'll give him back the painting .
 - He 'll let Mickey go .
 - Job done .
 - Eduardo , refreshments , please .
 PHONE RlNGS
 Hello ?
 Yes , Nigel !
 I see .
 All right , thanks for taking the time to call me back , I appreciate it .
 - They 've released Harry Holmes .
 - That was quick !
 Well , they found the painting in the house and it was fake .
 - What ? ! - That ain 't possible .
 We know it was the original , he had it nicked from Sava , who bought it at the auction .
 He wouldn 't have angry enough to kidnap Mickey and hung Ash upside down if all he 'd lost a fake !
 So if the one Harry had was a fake , where 's the real one ?
 Drinks up .
 " Oh , thank you very much , Eddie " " It 's a pleasure to serve you ... "
 " Yeah , thank you very much "
 - Doesn 't make sense . - No .
 - Let 's think about this for a minute .
 We have to assume that the painting the McCrary brothers nicked from Petre Sava is the real Picasso .
 - But by the time it got to Harry Holmes and his father- in- law , it was a fake .
 - Agreed .
 - Exactly .
 - So they switched it ?
 - Yes , it can 't be anything else .
 - So if they passed on a fake to Harry , they must 've had another buyer for the real one .
 - Robbing bastards .
 - The McCrarys have the real painting ?
 That 's the only thing that makes sense .
 - They must have it ! - Or at least know where it is .
 - The gate 's wide open .
 - Oh , we 're too late !
 There 's no sign of life anywhere ...
 - No , they 're long gone .
 - Of course they are .
 If you 're just about to stitch up Harry Holmes , you 're not gonna hang around where he can find you .
 They must have moved out just after we saw them , right ?
 They could be back in Glasgow by now . - We 're screwed .
 - No , you mean Mickey is .
 Wait , wait .
 If you were going to give Harry Holmes a fake , you 're not going to risk him spotting it , are you ?
 I mean , it 'd have to be near- perfect .
 So - where would you go for a near- perfect copy of a Picasso ?
 - A girl 's got to earn a living !
 - But why didn 't you tell us , Dolly ?
 Well , I didn 't know there was a connection !
 It 's the flaming cat in the wotsit , the painting we was asking you about !
 Yeah , but I can 't keep track of everything ,
 I 'm not an accountant , I 'm an artist .
 All right , all right .
 So ... step by step , right ?
 You did the fake for the McCrarys , right ?
 - Maybe . - Dolly !
 Stop messing about !
 Are you going to let him speak to me like that ?
 Eh ?
 I thought what we had was special .
 We didn 't have anything !
 You touched my Mabel !
 - What ?
 - That- That is what she calls her ferret .
 - Ferret ?
 - Yes , she keeps it in the khazi .
 I don 't let just anyone touch my Mabel .
 Dolly !
 Yeah , yeah , all right , all right .
 I made the McCrarys a fake , and they said that they 'd got a buyer , but he was a muppet and he 'd never know the difference .
 Yeah , well , that " muppet " is Harry Holmes .
 Oh .
 That 's not good .
 No , it 's not , is it ?
 So I need you to tell me what the McCrarys were doing with the real Picasso .
 They did say something about a new buyer .
 Who ?
 I don 't know .
 - Did they say anything at all ?
 Mention any names ?
 - No .
 OK , right , well , the , er , the fake ... so , when you 'd finished it , did they collect it from here ?
 - No .
 - So how did you get it to them ?
 I had to parcel it up and send it in a cab .
 Right .
 Where to ?
 - I don 't remember . - Dolly !
 This is important .
 Look , it 's all this pressure !
 I can 't think straight with you all looking at me !
 - Would it help if we all just looked away ? - Yes .
 Except him .
 Oh , come on , Dolly !
 Oh .
 Oh !
 Maybe a gin might do it .
 It helps me to relax .
 What do we have with it ?
 More gin .
 - Go .
 - Thank you .
 It was a hotel .
 Good .
 Which one ?
 Up west .
 Name .
 Have another gin .
 - She 's no use to us if she passes out , is she ?
 - I am here , you know !
 I could , er ...
 I could book us a room while I was there .
 It was the Goodridge on the South Bank .
 See if they 've got a four- poster !
 Is he still alive ?
 HE GRUNTS IN PAlN
 Yes , boss .
 You know your friends have two hours to return with my painting .
 If they are late , we cut off something every ten minutes until they get here .
 If they are not here in two hours , we kill whatever is left .
 What do you think of that ?
 Do you want me to take his gag off ?
 So he can tell you what he thinks ?
 No , no .
 I 'm a people person , it was a rhetorical question ,
 I know what he thinks .
 You do ?
 He is thinking he hopes his friends come before we cut anything off .
 Oh .
 Then maybe he 's thinking about what we will cut off , and in what order .
 True ?
 - Do you think they 're still here ?
 - Albert , do you know the concierge ?
 - Yes . Anthony ...
 Excuse me for a moment .
 I thought Dolly sent the fake painting here .
 Yes , because the McCrary brothers needed a fake to give to Harry Holmes , not the real one .
 - So it means the real one could be here ?
 - There 's only one way to find out .

 All right .
 They 're staying overnight , they 've booked a car tomorrow morning to go to the airport .
 And right now , they 're in the bar .
 They don 't look like they 've got anything with them .
 - What room are they in , Albert ?
 - 624 .
 They 've seen me and Ems , so we 'll check the room , you keep an eye on 'em , give us a heads up if they move .
 All right .
 - We haven 't got a lot of time .
 - You go that way .
 - Yeah .
 CHATTER AND LAUGHTER
 It 's not here .
 I 'm making a real pig 's ear of this , aren 't I ?
 All those times Mickey 's bailed us out ,
 I can 't even find a painting .
 We 're gonna find it , it 's just a matter of time .
 Time we haven 't got .
 It 's less than an hour now .
 Know what ?
 I 'd rather get tooled up , go to Sava 's and take me chances .
 - You can 't do that .
 - Yeah , well , I can 't do this either .
 It 's a setback , but come on , you 're just as smart as Mickey .
 Right .
 The McCrary brothers are still downstairs .
 Let 's just go and try to talk to them again .
 We can get through this .
 Let 's go .
 Now , that 's clever .
 See ?
 I told you we 'd get it !
 Who the hell are you ?
 CHATTER AND LAUGHTER
 So let me get this straight .
 Sava is holding your mate until you bring him this . Yeah .
 And he doesn 't know it was me who nicked the painting ?
 He thinks it was you .
 HE CHUCKLES
 Sounds like you 're up shit creek and left the paddle at home , sunshine .
 And I have had a right result .
 Just tell me one thing .
 How did you know it was here ?
 We didn 't .
 We just found the McCrarys and hoped for the best .
 Yeah , well those two stitched me right up .
 Didn 't just sell me a moody painting , they made me look like a prat in front of my wife 's family .
 Where are they ?
 No idea , there was no- one in the room when we got here .
 All right , seems to me you two haven 't done me any harm , you 've got nothing I need , and you 've got enough to worry about .
 So get out .
 Go on , sling your hook before I change my mind .
 We can 't do that .
 - Oh , yeah ? - No .
 Without the painting , Petre Sava 's not gonna let our mate go .
 So , I don 't care who you are .
 I ain 't leaving without it .
 And that 's your final word ?
 Yeah , it is .
 No , don 't !
 HE GRUNTS IN PAlN
 Oohh ...
 Ash .
 That wasn 't very smart .
 So have we got a plan B ?
 Well , it 's more like plan A revisited .
 Eh ?
 Harry will take the painting back to his father- in- law 's like a hero .
 And we 've got a plan in place to steal it back from there .
 - Clever .
 - Yeah , more importantly , we need Harry back at the house pronto , and finding the McCrary boys will only slow him down .
 So let 's make sure he has to leave now .

 I 've been chasing ...
 Oh , no .
 Yeah , I 've got it .
 Yeah , the real one .
 The same place as you left me in half an hour .
 But if Mickey 's not there , the deal 's off . .. OK .
 Half hour .
 - Well ? - All set .
 We 'll meet back at the warehouse in half an hour .
 We give 'em the real painting , they give us Mickey .
 - But can we trust them ?
 - The honest truth is , Albert , I don 't know .
 What if Harry realises it was us ? - I don 't know that either .
 - But Ash , what happens if ...
 Let 's get Mickey back first , and worry about everything else later , yeah ?
 Sounds like a plan .
 Yeah , well , first , I need a drink .
 Set 'em up .
 There you are !
 Mad Dolly told us where to find you .
 Oh ?
 That was you at the hotel , wasn 't it ?
 Hotel ?
 I saw you leaving .
 Just passing , were you ?
 That 's right , yeah , we erm ...
 Well , we found out where you were and we thought we 'd try again , you know , to convince you to ...
 let us take the painting .
 That 's what I thought .
 So it was you guys that set off the alarm , was it ?
 - Yeah , yeah , we ...
 - What did I tell you ?
 That 's why we 're here , we wanted to say thank you !
 Eh ?
 Look , I don 't know why you hit the alarm when you did , but if you hadn 't , we 'd have just waltzed up there and found Harry Holmes in our room .
 Yeah , well , you know , don 't mention it .
 So what happened ?
 You found us and then you saw Harry and his goons there too , right ?
 That 's right , yeah . So ... we legged it .
 - Only we didn 't want to drop you in it , so ... - So we hit the alarm .

 Look .
 All I know is if it wasn 't for you guys we would be screwed .
 So , thank you .
 It 's a pleasure , I hope you 'd do the same for us .
 Oh , absolutely !
 Well , there you go .
 We 'd love to stay and have a beer with you , but we have a flight to catch .
 We 've got to get home and make a start on spending this .
 400 grand ... for the painting .
 The painting ?
 The Picasso .
 We sold Harry one of the duds Dolly made .
 - Yeah , I heard .
 That 's why he was looking for you .
 - Oh , no doubt .
 But we also had another buyer lined up for the real one .
 German guy .
 Wait .
 You said you sold " one of the duds " to Harry ?
 So you sold a dud to the German too ?
 No , no , he got the real thing .
 Bid the highest you see .
 No , we had Dolly make two duds .
 We sold one to Harry , and the other we were going to sell to some Aussie guy in the hotel bar , but he was a no show .
 Yeah , yeah , but you can 't have sold the real one , because Harry found it in your room .
 He would have been pretty disappointed when he got home .
 - Eh ?
 - Did the deal with the German guy this afternoon ,
 long before Harry found us .
 If he found a painting in our room , it was the other dud .
 Shit , I think we actually hung it up on the wall .
 We were leaving it as a wee present for the hotel .
 Look , like I said , we just came here to say thank you .
 Oh , by the way , how did , er ...
 How did things pan out with your friend ?
 Oh , well , we 're , er ... We 're still working on it .
 Well , good luck with that .
 Cheers .
 DOOR CLOSES
 So we stole another fake ?
 You told Sava we had half an hour .
 We 've got 15 minutes .
 So what do we do now ?
 Here you are , mate .
 CAR ENGlNE STARTS
 When you live outside the law , on the fringes of society , you 're always going to have days like this .
 What you might call a bad day in the office .
 Well , the thing is not to panic .
 Because people like this lot , they 're like dogs , they can smell fear .
 So the trick is to make them think you know something they don 't .
 That way they 'll generally hold off killing you while they try and work out what it is .
 You have brought my painting ?
 - You brought my friend ?
 - Painting first .
 Friend first or there 's no deal .
 I don 't think you 're in a position to negotiate , do you ?
 If you believe that , it could be the worst mistake you ever made .
 I see my friend ... you see your painting .
 Now your turn .
 Right .
 Who 's got my painting ?
 This is none of your business , Harry .
 Well , I 'm making it my business , Boris ,
 I 've been dancing around you lot for too long .
 My name is not Boris .
 It is when I 'm talking to you .
 - You know , calling me Boris is racist .
 - Tough .
 Er , excuse me , can we , er ...
 Can we get on with this , please ?
 What are you doing here ?
 What do you think I 'm flaming doing here ?
 I 've come to swap this painting ... for my mate .
 - That is my painting . - No .
 - My painting .
 I nicked it , fair and square .
 And now I 'm getting it back .
 That 's enough !
 - Who you shouting at ?
 - You !
 The pair of you !
 Have you never heard of honour amongst thieves ?
 Some kind of nodding appreciation amongst your peers ?
 You 're like a couple of five- year- olds .
 " Please , Miss , he 's nicked my painting . " It 's pathetic .
 - And I 've had it with both of you !
 - Get the painting .
 Ah , ah , ah !
 I 've had a gun shoved up me hooter , been hung upside down and kicked up in the air .
 I 've been threatened by at least three nationalities while running around half of London chasing some stupid picture of a cat in someone 's back garden that looks like it was done by a three- year- old on a sugar rush .
 I 've been lied to , cheated and generally abused just because me and my mate here were trying to earn an honest crust when Rasputin here went and kidnapped him .
 - Hey .
 Rasputin is worse than Boris .
 - I said , shut it !
 Now , I don 't know whose painting this is and , to be quite honest , I don 't give a flying toss !
 - I 've had a very bad day !
 - Do you know who you 're talking to ?
 Never mind who I 'm talking to .
 You ought to worry about who we are , son .
 We 're grifters .
 Yeah .
 This bloke over here .
 He 's sold the Eiffel Tower , the Palace Of Westminster and the Sydney Opera House .
 We broke banks , companies and political parties .
 We took on the mafia in Las Vegas and we made the London Special Branch look like the Keystone Cops .
 So never mind about you two threatening us !

 Now , I 'm threatening you !
 We 're going to make you our hobby .
 Spend sleepless nights working out how to take away everything from you , every penny .
 It won 't be just a sodding painting you have to worry about , you 'll be working out where you 're going to sleep at night .
 Because we 're going to pick you clean .
 We 'll strip every bit of flesh off the bone .
 Nice speech .
 I got just one question .
 Yeah , what 's that ?
 How are you lot going to do that , when you 're dead ?
 Very good .
 Now , give me my painting . No .
 No .
 You give me my painting .
 Some people never listen , do they ?
 I tell you what ... you can sort it out amongst yourselves .
 Get it round the side !
 Yeah , that 's it .
 Watch what you 're doing !
 Don 't damage it !
 You didn 't phone , you didn 't write .
 Sorry , mate , I 've been a bit tied up .
 Is that who I think it is ?
 Harry Holmes , yeah .
 Good job he turned up .
 Yeah , well ... I phoned him .
 - You phoned him ? - Yeah .
 So what do we do now ?
 IN SCOTTlSH ACCENT :
 Hello .
 Harry ?
 Would you be interested to know who the McCrary boys were working for when they double- crossed you ?
 Aye , I do know .
 Have you got a pen ?
 Just watch the painting , will ya ?
 They don 't seem to like each other very much .
 No , well , I er ... I phoned the other one 'an all .
 IN RUSSlAN ACCENT : Harry Holmes .
 Yes , he cheated a friend of mine .
 So when I found out he stole your painting ,
 I thought it right to call you .
 And I phoned the Old Bill in case it went pear- shaped .
 They 'll be here any minute .
 I 've got it !
 - Oh .
 - Is that the real Picasso ?
 Oh , no , no .
 No , that 's a fake .
 - Guys . Can I ...
 Can I ask a question ?
 - Yeah , yeah .
 - I mean , I don 't want to sound ungrateful or anything . - No , it 's OK .
 Wouldn 't it have been simpler to get the real painting ?
 SlRENS WAlL IN THE DlSTANCE
 It 's OK .
 Cheers , Ed .
 Thank you .
 So no- one 's looking for us ?
 No .
 No , you see , they both thought that the original was damaged in the fight at the warehouse .
 But neither Petre Sava nor Harry Holmes could afford to lose face .
 So the only way they could save face was to have a fake each .
 That way , they could both say they won and honour is restored .
 And they all get to live happily ever after .
 Down .
 Ah .
 Yeah , well , you know , happy as they can be .
 Perfect .
 It seems the only winners are the McCrary boys .
 Tell me about it .
 They just walked off with 400 grand .
 Whoa , they might get to go with all the money but we got something much more precious .
 - We got Mickey back .
 - Oh , yes , that 's true . - Yeah .
 Ah . Thanks , guys .
 - You can 't put a price on friendship .
 But if you could , it 'd be about 400 grand .
 Ignore him - he was beside himself when you were gone .
 He was taking all the blame , he was full of self- loathing .
 It was heartbreaking to watch . It was . Yeah , yeah .
 We may have not made any money , but apart from the odd bruise ,
 - everything turned out OK .
 - Yes , it did .
 Ash , I 've got to ask you , did you really lose it with those gangsters at the warehouse ?
 We hadn 't got a lot of options at that point , so I thought I 'd do a bit of Mickey waffle .
 Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah .
 - " Mickey waffle " ?
 - Yeah , you know that thing where you talk a lot but don 't actually say anything .
 Sorry , no , I do not " waffle " .
 - You do a bit .
 - When ?
 Usually when you know you 're wrong but you won 't admit it .
 I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , but that 's far from waffling , that 's just my way of presenting a reasoned argument .
 A way of putting forward the facts , which in the main , Ash ,
 I 'm sorry to say , is something you fail to do .
 You prefer to use emotional rhetoric littered with expletives to make your point .
 No , it 's true , it 's true .
 That was not " waffling " .
 I wish you 'd left me in the boot now .
 Well , it can be arranged . ED :
 I brought you tomorrow 's papers .
 - Oh , cheers .
 That was that Dolly bird again .
 I was going to give you a shout but you were waffling .
 - Cheers , Ed . I wasn 't waffling .
 - Course not .



 Erm ... this Dolly ... she sounds a bit of all right on the phone .
 What 's she like ?
 - Oh , now ... now ... she is special . - Yeah ?
 Is she a looker ?
 Oh ... definitely .
 - Is she a looker ?
 - Got a lovely set of teeth , hasn 't she , Sean ?
 - Amazing .
 Only we had a little bit of a chat .
 We got on like a house on fire .
 Think she was flirting a bit when she , er ... when she rang earlier , you know , she said she
 liked me accent and that so , er ... so you know ...
 - might have a crack at it like . - " It " ?
 Yeah , yeah , you don 't mind , do you ?
 I don 't want to tread on anyone 's toes . No .
 Good for you , you go for " it " .
 She 's invited me round for a drink .
 Yeah ?
 Edward .
 This is a match made in heaven .
 You think so ?
 - Absolutely .
 - You knock yourself out , son .
 Cheers , guys .
 I 'll let you know how I get on .
 - Do you think that was a bit cruel ? - Yeah .
 Probably .

 Oh , listen to this .
 It says here that a Mondrian was stolen from a gallery in Central London , and it 's valued at £2 . 3 million .
 Doesn 't Tucker still do fake Mondrians ?
 - It was a joke .
 - Yeah !

 - Should 've seen your faces .
 - Oi !
