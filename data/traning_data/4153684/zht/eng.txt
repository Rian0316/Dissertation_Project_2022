 00 : 00 : 02, 000 -- > 00 : 00 : 05, 536 Earl , I noticed you 're still alive . What 's your secret ?
 Well , it 's my positive attitude , a little bit of genetics , and knowing how to take care of your body .
 I use jojoba .
 What is that , like a lotion ?
 No , it 's a ho named Hoba .
 She comes over once a week .

 Max , you just got box delivered at home .
 I don 't want another box .
 I got my hands full with this one .
 I used to have so many packages delivered to my house , my dad had to buy Fedex just to save money .
 I remember a time before mail .
 You just didn 't get stuff .
 Nope . I don 't want that .
 It 's a delivery from my mother .
 The last thing she delivered was me , and I 'm still cleaning up that mess .
 Aren 't you at least curious what she sent ?
 Unless it 's a brand new childhood ,
 I 'm not interested .
 Here , Earl , hold Max 's box .
 But she 's like a daughter to me .
 Look , Caroline , I brought in my fish tank , which Max has been calling my olympic- size swimming pool .
 See , Han ? The world 's different above sea- level .
 Now , come over here and say hello .
 I 'm saying hello to fish now ?
 That 's where I 'm at ?
 You too , Max .
 I want my diner family to meet my fish family .
 I got an aunt that drinks like a fish .
 Maybe she 's in there .
 Oh , no , she 's in jail for vehicular manslaughter .
 Please enjoy my ecosystem of love .
 Never tap on the glass !
 Just look at that meaty paw of yours .
 It 's like an earthquake to them .
 Oh , there 's my prize .
 The royal blue tang fish . $500 .
 Han , I 'm not surprised you have to pay for blue tang , but $500 seems high .
 Hey Han , Ho Hoba 'll do it for 25 .
 Well , I hope your fish will be very happy here .
 I mean , no one else is , but who knows .
 Let 's go , Max .
 [ Speaking Ukrainian ]


 Did Oleg take Liam Neeson 's daughter ?
 I 'm breaking up with all my ladies so I can start up again with Sophie .
 And Oksana 's not taking it lying down , or bent over like she usually is .
 Well , I 'm sorry I never got to meet her .
 Just tell her that you and Sophie have decided to be ...
 What 's the ukrainian word for " monogamy"  ?
 There isn 't one .
 You 're either ugly or you 're sleeping with everyone .
 Uh- uh . No way .
 Leave it out here .
 Let the bomb- squad figure it out .
 Don 't you wanna know what she sent you ?
 Maybe there 's money in there .
 [ Obnoxious laughter ]
 So you 're just gonna leave it out in the hall
 like a room service tray ?
 Oh , my God , I used to have room service .
 Oh , my God , I used to have a room .
 Well , I don 't want it in the apartment .
 This is a place of positive energy and good vibes .
 [ Obnoxious laughter ]
 I 'm sending it back to her tomorrow .
 I will go to my shallow , unmarked grave not knowing what 's in that box .
 [ Knock at door ]
 Hey , Max , you got a box out here , and there 's a bear in it !
 Oh , my God .
 She kept that ?
 How did my mom ever keep that ?
 She can 't even keep her teeth .
 That 's what was in the box ?
 A Teddy Ruxpin doll ?
 Are you registered at mustybears . com ?
 Not a doll and not his name .
 I had it legally changed to T- Rux .
 I used the same lawyer my mom hired to declare me Native American so she didn 't have to pay for parking at the casino .
 For six months , I had to answer the phone ,
 Max proudfoot .
 You know , in Poland , we didn 't have dolls .
 Yeah , we just hired little gypsy kids and we carried them around .
 Yeah , mine was called Gurgio .
 Yeah , and I think , uh , he had a little bit of polio .
 Hey , didn 't those things talk ?
 They did if you had four C batteries .
 Wait , I think I have some .
 Yup , they came with this adorable teddy bear singing cassette , so of course ,
 I smashed that with a rock and made my own .
 Yeah , my Gurgio didn 't talk .
 I 'm not sure he had a tongue .
 But he used to squeeze me really tight .
 And then I found out later , he was 35 .
 You had four C batteries in your nightstand ?
 From what ?
 Do you wanna hear the bear talk or don 't you ?
 [ Phone rings ] Oh , I 'm sorry , girls .
 I gotta take this .
 It 's another guy that I 'm breaking it off with .
 I sure hope Oleg 's worth it .
 I just dumped a guy with multiple personalities .
 Yeah , and he took it okay , and not great , and pretty bad .
 There 's no note or anything .
 This box is really just a well of disappointment .
 Why would your mother send you this ?
 Why would she do anything ?
 Why would she bite our dog ?
 Why would she make out with our Jack O 'lantern ?
 I don 't know .
 Well , Max , she did send you your favorite toy after all these years .
 Maybe she 's trying to make amends .
 Oh , make amends ?
 She couldn 't even make me a sandwich .
 Okay , you ready ?
 I know you are , but what am I ?
 [ Laughing ] Oh , my God . Max , is that you ?
 Is that your little Max voice ?
 Careful , I 'm about to open up a can of whoop ass .
 It is you ! How old were you there ?
 Ten . " Whoop ass"  was kind of my thing .
 Still is .
 I mean , I guess I always knew you were a little kid once , but I couldn 't picture it till I heard that .
 Like I couldn 't picture me eating fruit from an Exxon station till I did that .
 So , are you two ready to order ?
 Oh , yeah . I 'll have the turkey club with fries .
 This is why you 're single , Rita .
 I 'm not single . I 'm married to your father .
 I love you , but stop pushing your lifestyle in my face .
 I 'll have the salad . Dressing on the side .
 Obvs .
 Obvs , obvs .
 Well , I 'm sending T- Rux back to my mother .
 He 's going right into this empty box
 I found in Han 's office .
 And Max , before you send it back ,
 I 'm gonna need those batteries .
 Oh , don 't worry , I have no desire to see you hugging the milkshake machine .
 Oh ... my ...
 God ! Is that a Teddy Ruxpin doll ?
 Rita , I want that !
 Your birthday just passed , Elliot .
 But my coming out party is coming up .
 What is that , like a queen- ceanera ?
 So bitchy . Love her .
 A vintage Teddy Ruxpin is worth like , $500 , and my mom works , so she has to buy my love .
 One more word , and I 'm taking away spa day .
 That 's harsh , honey .
 He 's obsessed with the '90s .
 But you weren 't even born .
 I know . I blame her .
 She couldn 't find a man till late in life .
 There go the pedicures .
 There go my sandals .
 As much as I love watching this guy 's not for sale .
 I 'm sending him back to my mother 's place , which , according to the Rhode Island Parole Office , is a cardboard shanty town outside of big lots .
 Well , here 's my card .
 And let 's face it , you look like you could use $500 .
 So bitchy . Love him !
 I was just offered $500 for T- Rux from Baby Anderson Cooper .
 He has cards ?
 I 'm jealous of a nine- year- old ?
 That 's where I 'm at ?
 Hey , as much as I would like that $500 , my mother doesn 't get to think this bear gets to make up for my childhood .
 She doesn 't get off that easy .
 Trust me , we shared a pullout couch for nine months .
 Girls , can I see you over here ?
 I can 't believe we have to talk to the fish again .
 I can 't believe Max hasn 't put Han in the tank yet .
 Max , Caroline , every night from now on ,
 I need you to move the skimmer along the top of the water and take out the floating matter .
 Han , you know I 'm off diner poop patrol for life after I had to clean the booth where the senior left ...
 Well , we 'll just call it an elderberry .
 Well , Caroline , Max said no , so you have to do it .
 Han , you 're kind of a baller around your fish .
 All right , I 'm gonna do this fast .
 Get in and get out .
 Same thing I do when that bird is in our shower .
 [ Bell dings ] Pick up , Max .
 Look , I 'm calling to tell you I met somebody else so I 'm breaking up with you .
 Now put your mother on . I 'm breaking up with her too .
 I can 't believe this .
 I 'm a Cabana Boy for fish .
 I guess now I can add " fish poop remover " to my resume next to " supreme court intern " .
 I feel like there was a fish in that last one .
 Yup .
 Oh , no , it 's the expensive one !
 That 's so me .
 I really didn 't expect to see you digging through garbage till you were 30 .
 Oh ! Ah ! Ugh !
 It 's still alive ! I need to keep her wet .
 Oh , covered in tuna , that 's gotta be traumatic for it .
 I feel like it went down the drain .
 It was an accident .
 I swear . I love fish . I would never hurt one .
 Unless you count eating sushi , 'cause then I 'm like
 Jack the Ripper .
 Caroline , are things going swimmingly ?
 Jack , he 's talking to you .
 Uh , oh , yeah . Swimmingly .
 Especially the blue one .
 He went in his little house .
 He doesn 't like to use the restroom in front of his friends .
 Yeah , we 're a lot alike .
 Thank you so much for seeing us so quickly .
 Sure , you guys can just wait in here .
 Elliot 's finishing up with his pilates .
 Do yourselves a favor .
 Tell him his core looks tight .
 Max , I 'm so sorry you have to sell T- Rux for the fish money because of me .
 Talked to the fist , because the face is pissed .
 I 'm getting attitude from a bear ?
 That 's where I 'm at ?
 I can 't believe all this stuff he has from the '90s .
 I can 't believe he has to have a party to come out .
 That kid came out , out .
 His umbilical cord is a Gucci belt .
 Oh ! These toys !
 This is like looking back at my childhood but , you know , a time before rainbows became political .
 [ Gasps ] Oh , my God .
 Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
 A my size Barbie !
 I had ten of these .
 Not to play with , they were used as decoys in case of a hostage situation .
 And now your whole life 's a hostage situation .
 Sorry I 'm late .
 My trainer , Gary , and I got derailed talking about
 Your core looks really good .
 I know , honey .
 Now while I get my check book , say hello to the Olsens .
 You got a lot of toys .
 When I was a girl your age , I only had this .
 I don 't suppose I could play with my size Barbie for a second .
 I feel like that 's a " No , bitch " .
 I 'm not ... I 'm not just talking about the toys .
 You got a pretty sweet set- up .
 That nice lady out there , giving you everything you want , taking care of you .
 She 's just a mom . Everyone has one .
 Not really . Some people just have bad ass bears .
 Max , are you sure about this ?
 This is the only thing you have from your childhood .
 Not true , I have a dent in my skull from a ball- peen hammer .
 The last time I change the channel during
 Can we fast forward this to me having the bear and you two leaving ?
 Okay , just take it , it doesn 't matter .
 No , Max . It does matter .
 We 're not selling this .
 He has enough toys .
 I mean , all I wanted to do was touch the life- size Barbie .
 Okay , I see what 's happening .
 I 've been down this road with the Beanie Babies .
 I 'll give you 600 for the bear .
 Sold .
 No , Max ! That 's your childhood .
 - 700 .
 - Sold ! No , Max !
 Caroline , my childhood is not worth $700 .
 The most my mother ever got for me was 40 bucks and a big gulp .
 But that 's " little you " in there , Max .
 And she 's priceless .
 And she 's about to erased and taped over by the soundtrack from

 Who am I ? Me , a year ago ?
 No . Can 't have her .
 Well , what are we gonna do now about the other child ?
 The one in the diner ?
 You think if he had that ability , he wouldn 't have used it yet ? Well , I guess he 's just gonna have to grow up .
 Grow up ?

 So what , no bear ?
 Oh , please ! You 'll have a bear in your life .
 Trust me .
 All right , Max .
 You 're gonna help me tell him , right ?
 You like giving him bad news .
 No , I like giving him bad news about how he 's short and has a big head .
 You know , fun bad news .
 Exciting news !
 I got the fishies a new house !
 I got it cheap . It was a foreclosure .
 Uh , Han , can we talk to you over there in the booth , the far booth ?
 I want to put in the new condo so Max will stop calling me a slum lord .
 Can it wait ?
 Oh , that can wait , I mean , those fish aren 't going anywhere .
 Except for the blue one , who 's definitely playing some kind of twisted game of hide and seek .
 Oh , yeah , he loves that little house .
 He 's going to love this one even more .
 Max , can you join me ?
 I 'm pretty busy waiting on tables right now .
 Okay , what 's going on ?
 Max has never waited on a table in her life .
 Max , I need you over here .
 I 'm just putting down this grilled cheese
 ' cause I don 't want it to get cold .
 Now I 'm freaking out !
 Max , don 't do this to me .
 I know where the bodies are buried , literally .
 I move them every six months .
 Well , what is it ?
 Han , sometimes in life , things happen that you don 't want to happen .
 Yes .
 And even though it 's hard , you know , you just have to face up to it .
 I suppose .
 Oh , dear God , this is rough .
 And , well ...
 Han , I don 't wanna have to tell you this ,
 I know this is the last thing you ever want to hear ...
 Oh , just say it !
 The tampon machine is broken again .
 Later , I 'll get my blindfold and fix it .
 Word of advice ?
 When you do finally kill me , you gotta work on your game face for the cops .
 Max , please .
 I can 't tell han I murdered his fish .
 I can 't .
 Well , I can 't tell him either .
 Oh , hell , I 'll tell him .
 I 'm a black man , everyone already assumes I did it .
 Thank you . Thank you so much .
 It 's just a fish . He 'll be fine .
 I 've decided I 'll give Blue the new house at its birthday party later .
 It 's the damn fish 's birthday ?
 I 'm out .
 And you 're all invited .
 Blue 's two years old today .
 They don 't usually live that long .
 No , they do not .
 That 's it , we can 't tell him .
 Even at Han 's age , which I am guessing is somewhere between 14 and 53 , some kids just aren 't ready to grow up .
 What are we gonna do ?
 We 're gonna run out and buy a new one .
 Where are we gonna get the money ?
 Oleg , you know how two years ago you offered me $1, 000 for a back rub ?
 Of course .
 Caroline will do it for $500 .
 Deal . One last hurrah .
 Over the clothes , above the waist , and I don 't know why , but you have to wear a condom .
 Yes , Father Dominic Rosello , please .
 Oh , he 's celebrating mass ?
 Oh yeah , could you just tell him that Sophie Kachinski is converting to monogamy ?
 And uh , she won 't be kneeling at his altar anymore .
 Oh , yeah , yeah , he 'll understand .
 Where 's Han and does he know ?
 No , but I can 't keep pretending I see that fish .
 I 'm a pot- head with a touch of glaucoma .
 I 'm seeing stuff that 's not there .
 Not seeing stuff that 's there ...
 It 's confusing .
 Okay . Come on , come on .
 Put it in , put it in , put it in .
 I have a whole new respect for every guy that 's ever gone out with you .
 Happy birthday , Blue !
 ( Han ) Happy birthday . Happy birthday , Blue .
 Where 's Blue ?
 I haven 't seen her all day .
 I just saw it .
 Yeah , it was definitely there .
 You 're not gonna give Blue that cupcake without a photo- op , are you ?
 Where 's your iPad ? I just saw it . Yeah , it was definitely there .
 Yeah , Han , go !
 You need a pic so you can post it on Facebook or Fishbook or whatever .
 Good idea . Here , hold this .
 Hey , Caroline , you look less flat .
 You finally get that boob job you needed ?
 I feel like the baggy broke .
 Yup , that 's what happens when you get the cheap implants .
 Oh , my God , there is definitely something moving around in my bra .
 Well , it 's good you can still recognize that feeling .
 It 's right ... Oh ! Oh !
 I touched it ! Gross !
 Someone , put your hand in my bra and help me .
 Why now ? Now that I 'm off the market !
 No , no , no , no , no , no .
 I 'm afraid I 'm gonna squish it and kill it again .
 Okay , just get up on the counter and drop it in the tank .
 What ?
 Get up on the counter , spread your legs , and just let it fall into the tank .
 You know what ?
 Forget the back rub . After this , we 're square .
 Okay , straddle the tank , pull out your uniform , and let it go .
 Now I owe you money .
 Just squat over the tank like you 're delivering a fish baby .
 I 'm delivering a fish baby ?
 This is where I 'm at ?
 Stop asking . That 's where you 're at .
 Okay , now that I saw , right ?
 Caroline , get down !
 It 's not that kind of party .
 Max , you 're really still gonna send T- Rux back ?
 After we got bullied by a kid with a Tiffani Amber Thiessen pillow ?
 Relax , T- Rux is right over there by the register .
 And by the way , he 's our first employee .
 Anytime we get a bone- head customer , he can say ,
 " Talk to the fist ... ( Both ) 'cause the face is pissed . "
 I 'm just sending my mother something to say thank you for everything she gave me when I was a child .
 Aww , what 's in there ?
 Nothing !
