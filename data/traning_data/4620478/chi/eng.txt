 No , I came out to tell you some big news .
 You also came out when you wore that sweater to work today .
 John Mayer wore this sweater in
 Tonight , we are trying family- style service .
 I thought family- style service was what I had to do with my uncle .
 Well , my family- style is more " potluck " ... heavy on the pot , not so heavy on the luck .
 Why would a family come here ?
 If I see a child in here , I 'm calling the police .
 It 's like seeing a dog locked in a hot car .
 Chicken cacciatore , family- style .
 Liver and onions , family- style .
 Spaghetti and meatballs , my family- style , which means the balls are kinda small , but the noodles are extra long .
 You bring out the food in large bowls and the customers serve themselves , as they 've been doing since I hired you two .
 Good idea , Han .
 The diner food does belong in a big bowl ... the toilet bowl .
 I don 't know what your uncle saw in you .

 Max , I just found something very upsetting on my phone .
 Another free U2 album ?
 Worse .
 And worse than an e- vite to a friend 's improv show .
 It 's an e- mail from the managing director of all The High restaurants saying he 's seen our sales and is disappointed with my performance .
 Duh- lete ...
 like I do with all the " disappointed in your performance " texts
 I get from guys after sex .
 Sorry , gents !
 My boobs make a promise my bad back can 't deliver .
 Those bad sales numbers are not our fault .
 Our unit 's out at the airport .
 Well , I 'm not taking ownership of this because my unit is not at the airport .
 It 's in my bed table drawer .
 I 'm the manager .
 It 's on me .
 As is this tartar stain .
 It just refuses to come out .
 You 'd think it 's parents were Baptist .
 [ bell rings ]
 Well , Manager , I need to get out of there early tomorrow to do Sophie 's wedding cake , and also because you 're annoying as a boss .
 Hey , everybody !
 Me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me , me ...
 I love being a bride .
 You don 't even have to pretend it 's about anyone else .
 Kinda like me , when I was rich .
 Pretty much every single day still .
 Good news , bad news .
 The good news is the rash is not spreading past my nuts .
 And that 's the good news .
 Bad news ... the wedding donkey we booked for the church service died .
 I 'll ask the obvious question .
 Did it have anything to do with the rash ?
 I mean , what are we gonna do ?
 It 's not a traditional Polish wedding without an ass walking down the aisle .
 I think Oleg 's got that covered .
 Girls , we need an ass , you have a horse ... same family , but not related ,
 like the Jolie- Pitt kids .
 No way .
 Chestnut is my baby .
 Well , the donkey was getting a thousand bucks .
 Baby 's gotta work .

 I found a secret pathway to the Cinnabon kitchen !
 Move , bitch !
 Really ? You too ?
 I just don 't get it .
 It 's an acquired taste , like crystal meth .

 Ugh .
 Great .
 My waiter 's gonna be late again .
 " Held up at the TSA line . "
 That 's what I get for hiring an airport waiter named Mohammed Machdinajihad .
 Oh , look , Ronnie , a new place .
 I see it , Bonnie , I 'm right next to you .
 Didn 't this used to be the bar we got wasted in before our flights ?
 I can 't remember .
 I was wasted .
 [ both laugh ]
 Welcome to The High ... the finest in high quality desserts .
 We also have yogurts , cappuccinos , lattes , coffee , herb teas , or smart waters .
 And did I mention we 're a Boingo Hotspot ?
 Take it down a notch .
 You 're selling it harder than Anne Hathaway on
 Oh , hi , I 'm not here to buy , just to look .
 On a diet ... since 1998 .
 Oh dear lord , those look amazing .
 - Can I just smell a piece ?
 - Bonnie , don 't .
 It 'll get you going , and then halfway to Paris ,
 I 'll find you in coach binging on a bag of Sun Chips .
 That 's my favorite thing about the job .
 [ both laughing ]
 Oh , Paris reminds me .
 I bought two first class tickets to Paris ... on three credit cards that will escalate 20 % over six years ... anyway ...

 I really need to return them .
 What 's the window on that with your airline ?
 A month ... about the same amount of time I have until this fake smile finally falls off my face .
 Lady , we 're flight attendants .
 If that smile falls off your face , you 're gonna have to get a job at Southwest .
 Why are you returning them ?
 You don 't like Paris ?
 Paris , but long story short ...
 Uh , I 'll make it short because she 's incapable and will throw in lots more of that fake French .
 Bought the tickets so that I could get to the gate to see a guy I was banging .
 I hear ya .
 I once hid in the luggage cart for 12 hours to do it with this cute guy who works at Customs here .
 Oh , right .
 Rick .
 What 's he doing now ?
 Me , every third Tuesday .
 [ laughing ]
 Ahh , don 't leave me hanging , ladies .
 If we hadn 't just read in our wine club ...
 Ah .
 I mean book club ...
 We 'd be real jealous of you gals .
 We always had a dream to open a shop at the airport .
 Well , whatever it is , just don 't open near a Cinnabon because failure smells a hell of a lot like cinnamon .
 ( female voice ) Final boarding call for flight 24 to Paris .
 Final boarding call .
 Final boarding call ?
 We better hurry .
 [ both laughing ]
 Wow , everything looks so much smaller in here than I remembered it .
 Like returning to your old high school ... or your old high school boyfriend 's penis .
 Not mine .
 I went to an urban high school .
 What 's that weird smell ?
 It 's been in here so long , its own photo was on the carton .
 Probably that milk .
 No , it 's over here .
 Really pungent .
 Yes !
 Mm ...
 I might owe you two some rent .
 Unless you wanna settle in weed .
 I always wanna settle in weed .
 In fact , I plan to retire there .
 Marijuana 's in the closet ?
 This is more shocking than Meredith Baxter- Birney .
 Look , I figured since you two abandoned the cupcake shop , this space was available .
 Also , I stopped asking permission for stuff when I turned 70 .
 We did not abandon it .
 We just haven 't paid attention to it in 3 months ,
 like me with any hair above my mid- thigh .
 Tell me about it .
 When you bend over in that skirt , it looks like you 're giving birth to Art Garfunkel .
 Me , me , me , me , me , me , me !
 Oh , good .
 Earl , you 're here .
 Yes , I am .
 Don 't tell any of my ex- wives .
 Earl , would you do me the honor and walk me down the aisle tomorrow night ?
 Sophie , sorry .
 I didn 't know your father was dead .
 Did he die upon meeting Oleg ?
 Oh , he 's not dead , but I 'm not getting upstaged by an iron lung .
 Well , Earl , how could you say no to such a heartfelt request ?
 I 'd be honored , Sophie .
 Like the wedding saying goes ,
 Something old , something new , something borrowed , and someone black .
 Oh , Caroline , look .
 Here are the pink ribbons for Chestnut .
 Chestnut has to be covered in girly ribbons ?
 I can 't do that to my boy .
 I 'll throw in another 50 .
 I guess there 's a reason " horse " sounds so much like " whore . "
 Now , we 're all gonna leave for the church at 6 : 00 , but I told Earl 4 : 00 ,

 Okay , now we have a real situation .

 Yes , it 's awful , but look on the bright side .

 No , those arrived .

 I cannot catch a break .
 Wow , this place is packed .
 Remember us ?
 Bonnie and Ronnie ?
 We knew you when .
 Hey , wait , uh , Ronnie , didn 't you say that you boned a guy in customs ?
 I have standards ... and he didn 't like me . That was Bonnie .



 To be clear , I did have sex with the customs guy , but not in customs .
 It was in one of those family bathrooms .
 Look , is there any way you could help us get a package out of customs ?
 Wait ...

 Oh , done !
