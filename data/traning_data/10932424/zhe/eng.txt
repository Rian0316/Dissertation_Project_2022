 What the hell 's going on ?

 Mom thinks that I 'm crazy .
 I thought we weren 't supposed to say stuff like that .


 Baby , there 's something I need to tell you .
 Dr. Sturgis is not in the kind of hospital you think he is .


 What kind of hospital is he in ?
 The psychiatric kind .
 And you think since he and I are both gifted , I 'm going to end up like him ?
 Oh , baby .
 See how valuable a little communication can be ? You do not take credit for this .

 ADULT SHELDON : You never know where scientific inspiration will strike .
 For Newton , it was under an apple tree .
 For Archimedes , it was sitting in a bathtub .
 For me , on this particular day , it had a " sweaty people eating meat " kind of vibe .
 Sheldon , do you really have to do that here ?
 If the management didn 't want me to solve unified field theory , why would they give me a crayon ?
 I told you to crack a window and leave him in the car .
 It occurred to me that Maxwell 's equations would achieve full symmetry by adding a magnetic monopole .
 I drew a ladybug .
 All right , y 'all .
 - Oh ...
 - Is it okay to set this down ?
 I 'm a little busy . Could you come back later ?
 Sheldon , I 'm hungry . Let 's just sit over there . No .
 We 're gonna eat together as a family .
 Instead of electricity , we 'll have magnetricity .
 [ WHlSPERS ] : It 's getting heavy .
 We 'll be right over here if you need us .
 Let 's go . Bye , ladybug .

 Baby , you need to eat something .
 But it looks like I can change the definitions of electric and magnetic fields and rotate the magnetic charge away mathematically to zero .
 Maybe some fried okra would help .
 Richard Feynman didn 't develop quantum electrodynamics by filling up on fried okra .
 Well , maybe that 's because his mama didn 't love him as much as I love you .
 ADULT SHELDON :
 Richard Feynman was Jewish .
 His mother didn 't give him fried okra .


 Ugh . What am I missing ?
 Wake me up one more time , and I will sneeze in your mittens .
 A big , wet , snotty one .

 Baby , what are you doing ?
 Working .

 Have you been out here all night ?
 No .
 Why , what time is it ?
 7 : 30 .
 Oh .
 Then yes .

 [ GRUNTlNG ]
 Son of a ...
 Dad , you busy ?
 Do I look like I 'm busy ? I can 't see what you look like .
 You 're under the sink . [ GRUNTS ]
 What do you want ?
 Would you teach me how to throw a baseball ?

 I don 't know , just seems fun .
 Sure , why not ?
 Great , I 'll get the gloves . Not now !

 So , what 's new ?
 I 'm worried about Sheldon .
 I said " new . "
 He 's not sleeping , he 's not eating .
 We went out for barbecue last night , and he didn 't touch a thing .
 He also started biting his nails .
 I 've never seen him do that before .
 Is he worried about something ?
 He 's fixated on some science problem .
 Well , I 'm sure he 'll solve it and then everything will go back to normal .
 I hope so .
 What 's going on with John ?
 Not much .
 We write letters back and forth .
 That 's romantic . Romantic if he were off to war , not in a mental hospital .
 Well , he 's at war with his inner demons .


 - You 're right- handed , yeah ?
 - You don 't know ? Okay , smartass , which one am I ?
 [ EXHALES ]
 I 'm right- handed .
 Put this on your left hand .
 You ever thrown a ball before ?
 Just rocks at Sheldon . Did you hit him ? Every time .
 So , we got something to work with .
 All right , since you 're right- handed , which I now know , you 're gonna bring your arm up and follow through like this .
 Okay .

 Nice .
 You might be a natural . I 'm not surprised .
 This is the arm I color with .
 [ WlNCES ]
 I wasn 't even aware I was chewing them .
 Baby , I think this math problem you 're working on is stressing you out .
 It makes sense . Einstein struggled with it for 30 years and never found a solution .

 Maybe if you stop thinking about it , it 'll just come to you .

 - No . I can 't stop .
 - Sheldon .
 If I stop , I 'll lose momentum . I 'll never solve it .
 I 'll be a failure . My life will be worthless .
 Okay , that 's it .
 You 're taking a break from science .
 Give me one good reason why I would do that .
 Where is Dr. Sturgis right now ?
 That 's a good reason .


 All right , remember , you need to look right where you want the ball to go .
 Where else would I look ?
 Well , in the last five minutes ,
 I saw you watch a butterfly , a squirrel and the ice cream truck .
 You looked at the ice cream truck , too .


 Which team has a big red " T " on their hat ?
 Texas Rangers .
 - Is that a team we like ? - Uh , yeah .
 Yeah , that 's who most people around here root for .
 Okay .
 And what 's something I could say about the Rangers ?
 You know , to sound cool .
 - Is this about a boy ? - No . All right , sorry .
 If you want , you could say , " Even though Nolan Ryan is old , the Rangers were still smart to get him . "

 That 's a real thing ?


 That 's a real thing .
 How old is Nolan Ryan ?
 My age .
 Ew .
 I 'm so used to thinking about science ,
 I 'm not sure how to make myself stop .
 As soon as I think about not thinking about it , I 'm thinking about it .
 Well , why don 't you just think about something else ?
 - Like what ? - I don 't know . Read a comic book ?
 How do you think the spider that bit Peter Parker got radioactive ?
 Science .
 How do you think Bruce Banner got exposed to gamma rays ?
 - Science . - All right . When the Green Goblin flies ...
 - I said all right . - Science .
 I know you don 't want to hear this , but I find prayer can bring incredible peace of mind .
 Come on , Mary , I 'm trying to help the kid .
 You just need a new hobby .
 Very well . What are yours ? Smoking , drinking and gambling .
 But we can find you something almost as fun .
 Let 's sweat again !
 Come on , everybody !
 MEEMAW : Come on , Sheldon .
 Let 's get that blood pumping .
 - I 'd rather not .
 - [ CHUCKLES ]
 Do it .
 A little exercise will help get your head out of your butt .
 [ CHEERlNG OVER TV ]
 RlCHARD SlMMONS :
 Get those hands going . Back to the front .
 What do you think ? I think I hate this .
 Well , you 're not thinking about science now , am I right ?
 I 'm thinking about how miserable I am .
 SlMMONS :
 Let 's get on that train .
 Can we ? Back to the front .
 Come on .
 Three .
 Yes .
 Four .
 Count them out for me ! Five .
 Uh- huh .

 B- 14 .
 B- 14 .
 What else you got ?


 Are you positive other people 's fingers haven 't been in this ?
 I made sure to get you a new one .
 - It doesn 't look new .
 - It 's new .
 Let her rip .


 I 'm still thinking about science .
 That 's okay .
 Just aim for the front pin .

 You and Missy looked like you were having fun today .
 Uh , yeah , we were .
 A little father- daughter bonding .
 [ CHUCKLES ]
 Yeah . It was nice . Hmm .
 You guys were out there for a while .
 What were you talking about ?
 Oh , you know , just ... life .
 Sure .
 Everything okay ? Everything 's fine .
 Nothing to worry about .
 You 're really not gonna tell me ?
 No .




 Hey there , Sheldon .
 What can I do for ya ?
 I 'm wondering if you have any books on stopping bad habits .
 A few .
 What habit are you trying to stop ?
 - Science . - Yowza .
 It 's not permanent .
 I 'm just looking to take a break .
 I 've heard that one before . What did you take a break from ?
 Happiness .
 Okay .
 I 've tried a few different activities , but whatever I do just leads me back to science .
 Well , let 's think about it .
 What 's the opposite of science ?
 Science is based in facts , and the opposite of facts is fiction .
 How about fantasy ?
 Magic and dragons .
 We have a whole section here .
 Ooh , that sounds intellectually bankrupt .
 I 'll give it a shot .

 Good news .
 I found a way to take a break from science . That 's great . What is it ?
 A fantasy book series called The Lord of the Rings .
 Well , it 's got " the Lord " in it .
 That 's something .



 That one had some zip on it .
 Zip 's a good thing , right ?
 Yes .
 So it looks like I know what I 'm doing ? Just like a pro .
 But like a lady pro ?
 Oh , yes .
 Very much .
 Is there anything else good I could say about the Rangers ?
 Uh , let 's see .
 Tell whoever 's interested that no one 's ever gonna touch Nolan Ryan 's strikeout record .

 ' Cause he strikes out all the time .
 [ CHUCKLES ] : No .
 Because he throws strikeouts all the time . Oh .
 Big difference .
 Dinner 's ready .
 Five more minutes ?
 She wants five more minutes with her ole dad .


 What are they doing out there ?
 They 're bonding . It 's great . Sheldon , how 's your book ?
 Nice pivot . SHELDON : Excellent .
 There 's a character named Gollum who was corrupted by the Ring of Power .
 Now he runs around naked and bites the heads off fish .
 MEEMAW :
 That 's called sushi .
 Which , by the way , I will die before I eat .
 Speaking of dying , when you do , can I have your car ?

 This can 't be right .
 [ GROANS ] What now ?
 In the letter that Gandalf leaves for Frodo at The Prancing Pony , he says that it 's Mid- year 's Day ,
 Shire year 1418 .
 However , in Appendix B , it says that Gandalf met Radagast on June 29 , which is impossible because ...
 Hey ! Next time , it 's my shoe . And I will put zip on it .

 " The man who lived in the town was tall . "
 Which word is the relative pronoun ?
 Sheldon .
 Have you read The Lord of the Rings ?
 Um , I have , but that 's not what we 're really doing right now .
 The relative pronoun is " who . " Now , did you notice that in Fellowship ,
 Elrond says that the foundations of Barad- dûr were made with the One Ring ?
 Let 's say sure .
 However , in Appendix B , " The Tale of Years , " it 's clear that Sauron began building Barad- dûr in Second Age 1000 , 600 years before the ring was forged .

 Georgie . Imagine living with this .
 An hour a day is enough .
 The timeline doesn 't make sense .
 I mean , it lists
 Samwise Gamgee 's birth year as both 2963 and 2980 .
 Maybe he lied about his age .
 - Why ?
 - I don 't know .
 Maybe he thinks his neck makes him look older than he is .
 But he 's only in his 30s . That 's young . Thank you .
 For a hobbit .
 For a human , that 's mommy- age .
 Thank you .
 When Frodo and Sam are riding through the Shire , the book says the moon went westward , but according to the calendar Tolkien created , there should have been no moon visible .
 But in the appendix , Tolkien covers himself by saying there may be mistranslations from the Red Book .

 Fictional Tolkien says that , but I can 't help wondering if real Tolkien , who wrote the book , made the mistake or if it was an intentional mistake made by the fictional Tolkien , who translated these real- world events from an original source .



 Oh , no .
 Is that how I sound to people ?
 Hey ! You want to throw the ball around ?
 [ CRYlNG ]
 No , go away .
 Did something happen at school ? I don 't want to talk about it .
 Okay .
 Well ...
 You change your mind , you know I 'm here for you .
 He likes someone else .



 I 'm sorry , sweetheart .
 She doesn 't even know who Nolan Ryan is .
 This guy sounds like an idiot .
 He 's not .
 He 's perfect . All right .

 Want me to get your mom ?
 No .
 You want me to beat this guy up ?
 No .
 [ SNlFFLES ]
 What can I do ?
 [ SNlFFLES ]

 Nice .

 How do you make it curve ?
 Well , that 's a little tricky .
 You ... you put two fingers on the seam .
 Right ?
 And then you flick your wrist . - Okay .
 - Yeah ?
 Here , try it .
 Two ...
 Oh , so there .
 There you go , right on the stitch there .
 Two fingers on it .
 - Then at the end , you flick your wrist .
 - Like that ?
 There you go . Give her a shot .

 Hey !
 How about that ?
 Right ?
 Just like a pro , I 'm telling you .
 Well , we 'll work on that , shall we ?
