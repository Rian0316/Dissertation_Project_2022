 Thank you , everyone , for staying late to learn our new iPad order system .
 We had no choice , you locked the door from the outside .
 Either way , we 're learning .
 Han , why would we update our order system when our uniforms are from the 1970 's and our paycheck is from the 1800s ?
 Let 's get to the tutorial .
 Max , you and I are going to role- play .
 All right , you can be the little bitch , and I 'll be me .
 I don 't need this lesson .
 I 'm very familiar with the touch screen .
 Let 's just say I put the " goo " in Google .
 I 'm going to pretend I 'm a customer , and order a hamburger .
 Hello , miss . I 'll have a hamburger .
 Certainly , miss .
 Would you like that with or without salmonella ?
 Han , I got my first lesson on the iPad from Steve Jobs , and now I 'm getting it from Han Jobs ?
 Caroline , don 't act like you know more about gadgets than me .
 Formerly rich doesn 't beat currently asian .
 Now , come on , everyone look at their iPads .
 What iPad ? I didn 't see an iPad .
 What ?
 No .
 Did somebody say something about an iPad ?
 What the hell is an iPad ?
 Where did they all go ?
 I 'm guessing eBay .
 I want them all back , especially mine .
 I 'm in a casual flirtation with a woman in Australia .
 She 's part aboriginal , but has a great personality .

 Here you go , Earl .
 Max , what 's wrong ? You seem happy .

 I 'm just still on a high from this $10, 000 bank loan
 I got last week .
 And from an almost certainly laced pot brownie I ate in 2004 .
 I can 't believe you and Caroline got a bank loan for your cupcake business , and not a single hostage was involved .
 Max , you don 't have $10, 000 .
 You don 't even have Netflix .
 This money is to pay a factory to make our cupcake T- shirts , and I 've whittled it down to three .
 Hello .
 Speaking of whittled .
 Someone used my printer , and I 'm guessing it 's Caroline ,
 ' cause it 's about business and not another one of Earl 's Angela Bassett collages .
 What can I say , man ? I 'm a Bassett hound .

 Oh , thanks , Han .
 These are the factories I 've been researching .
 We want our T- shirts to be American made .
 I have an American maid , and all she 's good at is eating my granola bars .
 Look , Max , I found one right here in Brooklyn .
 " American Ace .
 The founder , Ace Hardwick , is devoted to treating his workers well , " and not in a creepy way like that American Apparel guy .
 So you 're saying none of these workers have ever found an ace in their hole ?
 Look , I 've worked in a lot of factories .
 I know what goes on .
 I worked in a coat factory , which is why my lungs are coated in asbestos .
 I worked in an underwear factory , where I was underpaid for the fruits of my looms , and worst factory of all , the cheesecake factory .
 Oh .
 How about we do a walk- through tomorrow to make sure it 's up to snuff ?
 Well , if they have snuff , why are we waiting till tomorrow ?
 Hey , everybody !
 Hi , great news !
 I just got carded at Buffalo Wild Wings !
 Really ? I got carted out of there once .

 And more great news :
 I 'm starting my own new business .
 So girls , you know how you have that $10, 000 ?
 Well , I don 't want to clean you out ,
 But how do you feel about tossing me $9, 500 ?
 You two should invest . Sophie 's business is genius .

 You know how a bunch of ladies got their down- there- hair permanently lasered off ?
 Yeah , that 's when your waxer gives you a Michael Chiklis .
 Yeah .
 Well , Sophie 's offering a product that puts grass back on your field .

 That 's not a business . That 's nobody 's business .

 Yeah , I don 't do any of that stuff .
 I just throw a scrunchie on mine and go .
 Hey , there 's a need for this .
 Sometimes , in the fog , my plane gets lost without a landing strip .
 We 're out .
 Oh , don 't decide yet , girls .
 You haven 't even heard the cute , little name .
 " Sophie Kuchenksi 's Vagina Wigs ! "
 Yeah , we 're really out .
 Oh .
 But it 's a quality product , and it 's real hair imported from " Va- China . "
 Yeah , never been further out .
 And this is our main floor .
 Wow , this is amazing !
 I feel like we 're in the Willy Wonka Factory .
 I know , right ?
 The American Ace motto is " Work is fun " .
 Max was expecting a different kind of factory .
 More torture , less foosball .
 I know , right ? Not at American Ace .

 And what is your position here , Peggy ?
 Are you the " I know , right ? " person ?
 I know , right ?
 No , I 'm one of the owners . Also , I dye T- shirts .

 See , every employee gets a percentage of the company after six months , so the longer you stay , the more it grows .
 We 've been at the diner four years , and the only thing we 've seen grow is Oleg 's pants .
 I know , right ?
 Well , Ace is expecting you .
 Go ahead , go have fun !
 Hey , don 't be fooled by what 's on the surface .
 You look like you have money , but I know your underwear 's in shreds .
 Not shreds , Max , shred .
 Just one , it goes from front to back .
 Um , hi , should we just come in ? The door is open .

 Yep , always is .
 Doors create boundaries .
 Boundaries are a bummer .
 You know what else is a bummer ?
 Tall guys with small penises ?
 That you just missed the gelato and designer coffee cart .
 Espresso hazelnut praline ?
 We 're not here for gelato .
 We 're not not here for gelato .
 Awesome . It 's awesome to meet you .

 I 'm Ace Hardwick .
 Look , " Ace " , we 're not about to give you $10, 000 so you can take advantage of a sad , underage girl worker near the loading docks ' cause her boobs are crazy big and she needs a ride home .

 That 's a " for instance . "
 I 'm sorry ?
 See , Ace , Max has some trust issues
 When it comes to factories , so , we 're here today to ...
 You 're pretty much eating cardboard there .
 You want me to get you another ?
 You should see her with tuna cans .
 Hey , I see the prosciutto cart .
 Who wants imported ham ?
 Me !
 Well , we 're not not here for prosciutto .
 Hey , you know what 's cool ?
 Short guys with big penises ?
 You 're fun .
 Your business belongs here at American Ace .
 Come on , let 's go meet the family .
 That guy kind of creeps me out .
 On the plus side , I finally get to meet my family .
 I had this space designed for open energy and open conversation .
 What 's up , other owners ?
 What 's up , ace ?
 Our sales , by 400 % !
 Max , this is it . This is our factory .
 The employees look happy and successful .
 So did the members of 'N Sync .
 But behind the curtain , a veil of tears .
 Hey , Caroline , here 's the prosciutto cart .
 Thanks , Ace !
 I 'm just gonna get a quick five- minute chair massage .
 Enjoy .
 Come on , let 's slip out while Ace has got his head stuck in that chair 's ass .
 Hey , what 's up ?
 Welcome to American Ace . I 'm Rico .

 You 're , like , really , really , really pretty .
 Aw ... oh !
 So anyways , I 'm part owner , and I clean the bathroom .
 Hmm , quick question :
 Do you have a light cabernet ?
 Quicker question :
 Where 's the secret room with the toddler slaves ?
 What 's up ?
 I 'm Raul , part owner and security guard .
 Hey , you two want to grab a drink sometime ?
 Fridays after work , we all hang next door at Tortilla Flats .
 Tortilla Flat . Wasn 't that your stripper name ?

 You 're just jealous 'cause mine 's taller and thinks I 'm really , really , really pretty .
 Good luck with that tall guy scenario .
 Sorry we 're late , but we were busy with our other business , the one we care about .
 How can I be mad with that sincere , heartfelt apology ?
 Who wants to see our sample T- shirts ?
 I want to see it , but I want to see a lot of things .
 With these damn cataracts , the best I can do is look towards it and get a milky idea .
 Hey , girls !
 I want to show you some of my new styles for my " everybody 's merkin for the weekend " collection .
 Sophie , what 's a merkin ?
 It 's a vagina wig .
 Oh , that 's dirty .
 And Han , I 'm gonna need your input , because I 'm working on an asian line .
 Shouldn 't Han grow some hair on his before he starts tossing out advice ?
 Han , I need to know if I got the texture right , so come over here .
 Oh , yeah .
 Yeah , that feels nice . Ohh .

 Ohh .
 Yeah , nice and thick between my fingers .
 Oh , yeah .
 Slower .
 Slower still .
 This is like watching your gerbil hump a pencil .
 Not really sexual , but still grosses you out .
 Sophie , I- I think you should stop .
 I haven 't felt this sensation since third grade when madam Yi checked me for head lice .
 Remind me to pick up a " what 's happening to my body ? " book for Han tomorrow .
 Oh , girls , I 'll be over here , working on my African/ American line .
 Yeah , I can 't decide whether to call it a " Vag- afro "
 Or a " Pube- a gooding , Jr "
 Max , look . These shirts look amazing .
 Well , I guess I was wrong about the factory .
 Like I was wrong about you
 Making it through that first winter .
 Look , there 's a note in here .
 Oh , it 's probably from Rico . He 's obsessed with me .

 Yeah , it 's not from him .
 It says , " help us " .
 Underpaid workers are trapped in that factory , I knew it !
 Once again , I was fooled by ice cream .
 Yes , it 's a note that says , " help us , " but if there 's one thing I learned in business school , it 's if you don 't see it , it doesn 't exist .
 Look , as much as we want to , we can 't just look away .
 We need to talk to the workers .
 Call the guy , the one who thinks you 're pretty .
 I don 't know who you 're talking about .
 I only met a guy who thought
 I was really , really , really pretty .
 We can meet them at that Mexican place .
 Ooh , a Mexican place !
 I forgot about the Latina market !
 Girls , when you 're there , find out if they 'd be interested in some hair south of the border .
 Didn 't know if you ladies wanted beers or margaritas , so we got you beer- garitas .
 It 's five bucks , but you 're worth it .
 I love a girl with a healthy appetite .
 Well , you 're gonna be getting down on one knee before the end of the appetizers .
 So let 's just dive right in .
 How 's factory life treating you ?
 Give us the skinny ... which is what I hope you said when you ordered those beer- garitas ,
 ' cause I cannot be poor with a muffin top .
 You know , I don 't want to talk about work .
 Oh , are you saying you 're not allowed to talk about work ?
 Your words , we all heard you , Rico or Raul .
 Hey , tell me , what do you girls like to do ?
 Mm , I like to watch waiters make guacamole at my table .
 When 's that gonna happen ?
 - So about work ... - Yeah , okay .
 Hey , let 's go see what 's going on in beer- garitaville .
 What are we gonna do ? I can 't get any information out of Rico .

 He 's so preoccupied with how pretty , pretty , pretty I am .
 Oh , hi , Peggy . How are you ?
 Would you like to join us and talk about work ?
 Why don 't we talk about you two skanks gettin ' the hell outta here ?
 And I thought we were bad waitresses .
 This is Carmen . She works at the factory too .
 We 're BFFs , and she 's one of the owners , like me .
 Yeah , and she 's a 100 % owner of Rico , so Hands off .
 We see you two sittin ' over here
 like you 're God 's friggin ' gift .
 I know , right ?
 And not for nothing , but Rico 's pit bull doesn 't like other girls .
 I 'm guessing that 's his pit bull .
 And you , hands off Raul .
 We have a love that is deep and real , and when he finds out about it , it 's gonna be magic .
 Yup ... Exactly what I expected .
 Upstairs is Willy Wonka 's factory , and down here , they 're waterboarding Oompa Loompas .
 Yo , what 's up ?
 We just comin ' here to work in the dye room right there as per usual .
 Yeah , no biggie .
 What yous twos lookin ' at ?
 That was a really good accent .
 Thanks . I played Rizzo in Grease .
 Should have been Sandy , but I let the girl with the limp have it .
 Come on , we have to put these on and go into the dye room ,
 ' cause I 'm guessing that 's where it all goes down .
 The dye room , I 'm not surprised .
 I always knew we 'd dye together .
 Okay , we 'll just pretend to be working here ,
 like we do at the diner .
 Well , well , look who it is , stuck- up and stuck- up two :
 The legend returns .
 Max , we gotta go . My life can 't end wearing grey .

 What up , ladies ?
 Last night , you 're hanging with the homies , and today , boom , you just happen to be working here .
 That 's friggin ' convenient .
 I know , right ?
 Very friggin ' convenient .
 I know , right ?
 We just have to show them who 's boss .
 You know , like we do with the mouse who lives in our toaster .
 So , what , we 're gonna scream and then spray Windex at them ?
 Yo ! See this scar ?

 Knife fight with five catholic schoolgirls over a slushie .
 So unless you want some of what I gave Virginia , Stephanie , Laquetia , Latoya , and the one in the wheelchair , I 'd stay clear .
 This is just a misunderstanding .
 Rico 's not interested in me .
 Well , he seemed pretty into you last night .
 Huh , yeah , but that 's before she talked .
 Come on , we are not interested in your men at all .
 Not at all . I mean , come on .

 What 's that mean ?
 You 're saying something 's wrong with them ?
 No , she 's not saying that it 's just ...
 It 's just what ?
 We 're lovers .
 You two are lovers ? ' cause you don 't seem ...
 We don 't seem what ?
 Gay ?
 No . Hot enough .
 Well ...
 Not hot at all .
 I know , right ?
 Look busy , keep your eyes open .
 I think we 're in the belly of the beast .
 You talkin ' about me ?
 No .
 Max , what do you think 's behind that locked door ?
 I knew it ! Toddler slaves .
 Those kids are in horrible danger of becoming ... me .
 Come on , let 's go over there .
 What the ...
 You hit me !
 Sorry , so sorry .
 Accident !
 You throw like a girl .
 See , I knew it , you two aren 't gay .
 Yous are after our guys !
 No , I 'm not !
 Rico just thought I was really , really , really pretty .
 Oh , hell no !
 Leave my lover alone !
 Oh !
 It 's on !
 No ! No !

 It 's ... no , no , no , no , no !
 It 's not on .
 This is silly . We 're not after anyone .
 We 're here to help some of those work ...
 Oh , yeah .
 Now , it 's on !
 Oh ! I warn you !


 Oh , hell no !
 Back off , bitch !
 Who you calling bitch , bitch ?
 Honey ? You 're getting carried away .

 Now you 're really getting carried away .
 Oh , no ! Don 't put me in the dryer !

 I used to be rich , I 'm dry clean only !
 Oh !
 Oh !
 That was a big friggin ' mistake !
 Respect .
 You two are a lot tougher than those girls from Saint Bridget 's .
 Whoa , whoa , whoa !
 What 's happening ?
 We 're busting you . We know what 's happening here .
 What , profit sharing and healthcare ?
 We found a note in our box with " help us " scrawled on it .
 How do you explain that ?
 Did you read the back ?
 Heh heh heh . " help us ..
 " help you ... to your full potential at American Ace "
 We put one in every box we ship .
 I have got to start reading more than the first sentence of stuff .
 I 'm sorry , this is all my fault .
 I guess I just wanted to believe some kids were having a worse childhood than I was .
 Max , don 't feel bad .
 You thought someone needed help , and you cared , and that makes you a good person , and I 'm proud of you .
 I said I was sorry . You don 't have to be mean .

 Hey , everybody !
 I just got my first shipment of wigs .
 Sophie , why are you walking like that ?
 Well , I 'm not just the president ,
 I 'm also a client .
 Sophie , I think you dropped something ,
 Unless we have those giant Persian roaches again .
 Even a milky version of that was too much .
 You know , Max , maybe someday , someone like you will come into this Salmonella factory and rescue us .
 - What are you writing on those checks ?
 - " Help us " .
 We work here . The " help us " is implied .
