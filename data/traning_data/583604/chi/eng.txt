 What is it ?
 I can 't find anything to eat . Everything makes me nauseous .
 Being pregnant is no piece of cake . Oh , cake !
 Honey , I 'm sorry . What is that smeIl ?
 It 's coming from the bathroom .
 Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings . It 's me .
 Listen , there 's something in here I want to eat . What smeIls so good ?
 Is it the shampoo ?
 It 's guava . Wait .
 Is it my bologna sandwich ?

 I can 't believe it !
 The baby wants bologna . I can 't eat meat . Wait !
 Maybe it 's the pickle !

 What are you writing ?
 Joshua 's coming in , and since I don 't have the guts to ask him out . . . . . . I 'II seII him a coat and put this note in the pocket .
 " Joshua , give me a caII sometime . Guys Iike you . . . . . . never go out of style . "
 What did you throw away ?
 - Hi , guys .
 - What have you been up to ?
 We went to see a coIlection of Victorian doorknobs at the museum . Without me ?
 My uncle dragged us there , but it turned out to be interesting .
 They were so ornate and beautiful .
 Look at that . I don 't know about England , but here , you 're not supposed to take stuff .
 I got it from the gift shop .
 They have reaIly Iax security . It 's a joke .

 I 've got to be off .
 See you .
 You 're having a good time . She is amazing , and she 's so much fun .
 And you know what ? When I 'm with her , I 'm fun !
 I even signed up for helicopter classes .
 She 's Ieaving in two days . I don 't have to do it . In two days ?
 You must be bummed . She 's got to go back , but I 've been prepared for this .
 We knew we had two weeks together and then that 's it .
 That 's what aII my relationships are Iike .
 But in Ross ' case , they both know two weeks is it .
 Yeah , I know .
 I know ! The baby is totaIly craving meat .
 I made it a soy burger , so that it 'd think it was getting meat . And I got nauseous .
 Maybe that 's because soy burgers suck !
 Pregnancy is hard on your tummy .
 But you got that cooI pregnant- Iady glow .
 You throw up aII morning , you 'II have that glow too .


 - Here 's that trench coat you wanted .
 - Great .
 It 's comfortable .
 You could reaIly flash somebody in this .
 Don 't put your hands in the pockets untiI you are out of the store .
 Why not ?
 WeIl , because . . . . . . we get a Iot of --
 They ruin it for everybody . I know .
 I wore that sweater on a date Iast night .
 It was the first date since the divorce .
 Congratulations . So do you love her ?
 She 's nice , but it made me realize . . . . . . I 'm just not ready to be dating .

 That 's interesting .
 - What was that ? - Just an anti- theft device . Then what 's this ?
 You need that too , because a thief could just tear this up .
 We have to have a party in five minutes , so everybody canceI your plans .
 What 's going on ? We have to have a bon voyage party for Emily .
 But it 's actuaIly for Joshua .
 He said he 's not ready to date . So I had to invite him to a party .
 And now I have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him .
 As much as I 'd Iike to meet Josh and warn him . . .
 . . . Emily and I won 't be here .
 She 'II come by to say goodbye . I 've got a speciaI evening planned . Sorry .
 No party .
 Surprise !
 Surprise !
 No one 's thrown me a surprise party before . WeIl , it was aII Ross ' idea .
 You 're so sweet . And I 'm so surprised .

 You didn 't know ?


 Why are you here if Joshua 's over there ?
 I 'm trying to play hard- to- get . Quick !
 Say something funny .
 Like what ?
 What 's so funny ?
 " Like what ? "
 Now that 's a thinker . This playing- hard- to- get thing is not working .
 Hand me those cherries .


 - Care for a cherry ?
 - No , thanks .
 I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue .

 You okay ?
 AII right ? We should probably get going soon .
 But the party 's just getting started .
 We have to be at The Four Seasons for drinks in 1 5 minutes .
 Then The Plaza for dinner .
 Why did you plan a party at the same time ?
 ActuaIly , American surprise parties are very short .
 It 's usuaIly , " Surprise ! " Then , " My God , I 'm so surprised .
 Bye ! "
 But I 'm having such a great time .
 Your sister told me that you dressed up Iike old Iadies . . . . . . and hosted make- believe tea parties .
 Monica said that , did she ?
 Then what are you going to put on top of that ? A Iittle salami .

 What goes on top of the salami ? Pastrami .
 You 're a genius .
 Give me a hand with the zipper .

 Up ! - You changed ?
 - I just needed my Iucky dress .
 - Lucky means more cleavage ? - It does for me .


 Look at him ! He 's so cute . I just want to grab him and kiss him .
 How could I kiss him without him knowing I Iike him ?
 I know how you can get him . Take off your bra . - This scene in Footloose -- - Flashdance .
 - With that plumber girl ?
 - A welder .
 Were you , Iike , in the movie ?

 She takes off her bra under the shirt and puIls it out the sleeve .
 Very sexy .
 And classy . - Or you could use mistletoe .
 - It 's not Christmas .
 - Spin the bottle . - He 's not 1 1 .
 Thank you . It was so thoughtfuI of you .
 You 're Ieaving ? - We have something we have to get to . - I 'II take off too .
 You can 't Ieave yet . You have to stay . We 've got the whole big thing planned .
 What big thing ? Spin- The- Bottle works Iike this :
 I spin . Lands on Gunther , so I 'd kiss Gunther .
 Who wants to go first ?
 I 'II go .

 Welcome to America .


 Oh , my God !
 Two in a row ! Use your tongues now .
 AII right .
 What are the odds ?
 That 's enough !
 Let 's Iet someone else play .
 If you didn 't want to play , why 'd you come ? Okay , my turn !

 Look at that !
 Oh , my God .

 The baby just kicked ! If it kicked once , it 'II kick again !

 Everybody just remember where they were sitting .

 It was a bug .

 It doesn 't matter how much I 'm craving it .
 I 'II never eat meat .
 It 's cold- blooded murder .
 There 's a Phoebe on my sandwich ! What are you doing ?
 I can 't help it !
 I need the meat !
 The baby needs the meat .
 When you date , you don 't want to cheat unless it 's with someone reaIly hot .

 TotaIly . This is the same kind of deal .
 If you do something wrong . . .
 . . . do it right .

 FeeI better ?
 Yeah , but at what cost ?
 Six months , three meals a day ?
 I am going to eat Iike , you know , miIlions of cows .
 What if I even things out for you , meat- wise ?
 I eat a Iot of meat , right ?
 But suppose , untiI the baby 's born , I Iaid off it .
 No extra animals would die . You 'd be eating my animals .
 I can 't believe you 'd do that for me .
 Absolutely !
 I could be a vegetarian .
 There 's no meat in beer , right ?
 We can stiII make dinner if we skip the appetizers .

 We can 't go now . RacheI is going to put on a skit .
 Oh , my God !
 Have you Iost your mind ? I am finaIly thinking clearly .
 My Iucky dress wasn 't working .
 But for four years , this baby never missed .
 Wait , I can 't Iet --
 ActuaIly , I want to see what happens .
 Nice costume .
 WeIl , I wanted to give Emily a big American goodbye cheer .
 Ready .
 Give me an " E " ! Give me an " M " !
 Give me an " I " ! Give me an " L " !
 Give me a " Y " ! What do you get ?


 That 's me as a cheerleader ! I Ioosened a tooth .
 It 's no big deal . I have a dentist . I 'II put some ice on it .
 Excuse me .
 What do I do now ?
 I think you 're done .
 Time to take off the bra .


 That was reaIly great .
 But I got to take off .
 Take the bra off .
 Let 's go get your coat .
 Rachel 's my girlfriend .

 So this was reaIly fun . Yeah , it was reaI fun .


 You know , this bra . . .
 . . . is reaIly bothering me . This used to be my bedroom .

 A Iot of memories in here . Lot of memories .
 If these waIls could talk , they 'd say :
 " Want to hear some memories ? "

 Need a hand ?
 I got this aII under control .
 You reaIly don 't seem Iike you do .
 God ! Forget it !
 This is not how this was supposed to happen .
 What was supposed to happen ? Can you not Iook at me ?

 I thought that if I could get you here . . .
 . . . I could seduce you .

 I don 't wear suits to work .
 And I bought six of them from you .
 I 'm sorry .
 I thought you needed them .
 My point is , I kept coming back because I wanted to see you .
 Because I Iike you .
 You Iike me ?
 I mean , you 're beautifuI and smart and sophisticated .
 A Iot of this isn 't based on tonight . But you Iike me ?
 I can 't believe this . AII this time , I Iiked you and you Iiked me !
 No " but . " " But " is never good .
 Let 's Ieave it at " I Iike you and you Iike me . "
 - However -- - No , that 's a fancy " but . "
 My marriage , Iike , just ended .
 And I 'm reaIly not ready to get into anything yet .

 I 'm sorry . I just need a Iittle time .


 There you are . I was Iooking for you .
 Joshua 's gone , so you and Emily are free to go .
 It 's okay . She 's stiII in there enjoying her fake party .
 It 's too Iate to do the stuff I had planned . I 'm sorry .
 I ruined your evening .
 If it makes you feeI any better , I made a fooI of myself . Helps a Iittle .

 Is there room there for a pathetic Ioser ? Have a seat .
 I 'm so sorry .
 It 's okay . It was just a two- week thing anyway .
 I just didn 't want it to end this way .
 Or maybe you didn 't want it to end ?
 What do you mean ?
 You seem to reaIly Iike her . I reaIly do .
 What am I going to do ?
 We agreed it 'd be a two- week thing . No commitment .
 That girI just spent the entire evening talking to your friends . . . . . . asking to hear stories about you . . . . . . Iooking through Monica 's photo albums .
 You don 't do that if you 're just in it for two weeks .
 You think ?
 You 've got 1 4 hours untiI she has to be at the airport .
 And you 're sitting here in a haIlway . . . . . . with a 28- year- old cheerleader with a fat Iip .

 You 're right .


 What photo album was it ?
 It was you and a bunch of albino kids . Oh , my God !
 Those weren 't albino kids . That was computer camp !

 You 're a pathetic Ioser , right ?
 Sit !

 Oh , my God . Joshua .
 AII those things I said about not being ready --
 - They 're not true ?
 - They 're aII true .
 But . . . .
 I love that " but " .

 Do you want to go inside and get some coffee ?
 Every time .

 - What do you got there ?
 - Pastrami .
 - You know what goes good with that ?
 - Corned beef .
 I was going to say bologna .
 But that 's better . How about that smoked turkey ?
 Oh , mama !
 - When is the baby due ? - Six months .
 If a cow died of naturaI causes , I could have one of those , right ?
 Not if I get there first .
