 For " really fucking scary . " So sit there and learn .
 I 'm gonna get Fiona .
 She wouldn 't like this movie . This is gonna be our little secret .
 Hmm .

 I 'd trade my left nut for one more hour of sleep .
 - You 're gonna be late for school . - Hey ,
 I hope you 're hungry -- most important meal of the day .
 Carl , sit .
 House could use a spring clean . It 's November .
 It 's like in here . What 's with you guys ?
 Debbie , can you get your father up ?
 He 's out in the alley by the Chopiaks ' garbage cans . Help him to bed .
 Ian left for work early .
 Did you hear , I kicked Terry Milkovich 's ass ?
 Not the first time someone 's come in here fists first .
 Why don 't you go for a run ? When 's the last time you did that ?
 Got too much to do .
 Like ?
 Uh , make lunches , get Liam dressed , take him for his checkup .
 Made lunches already . I 'm here .
 Doesn 't all have to fall on you . I 'm doing better ,

 Carl . Carl Gallagher .
 Okay , if you 're not going to eat , I want your teeth brushed in two minutes .
 Come on , wear this . - You Febreze it first ?

 Why don 't you go for a run ?
 I remember when you used to run six miles before school every morning .
 She did . Steve , is Lip okay ?
 Got great news . Can I come over ? No .
 I 'm right outside the house . Of course you are .
 My wife is in love with another guy .
 - Congratulations ?
 - Marco . I 'm importing him to the States , I 'm gonna surprise her .
 Yeah , what 's her dad got to say about it ?
 Nothing can stand in the way of true love .
 He finds out , you 're going to be Hoffa 'd .
 He 'll remain blissfully in the dark down in Rio .
 Can I come in ? - 'Cause we got nothing else to work out .
 - Like what ? Like you still being married and harboring my brother ?
 He 's a truant , not a terrorist .
 Come on , Dad .
 Morning , Debs .
 Bring any coffee ? - Hmm , sorry .
 - Step up .
 Wife 's boyfriend ain 't here yet .
 So when he gets in , so do I ?
 Deal . Don 't make plans tonight .
 I 'm picking him up right now .
 I never said " Deal . "
 All right , Mandy , third try .
 Look , I 'm really bad at taking hints , so I 'll hit double digits if you don 't call me back .
 Look , I need you to get your dad to back off .
 Coming !
 Package . Signed for it .
 Oh , oh , y- you don 't have to get my mail .
 Oh , i- i- it 's the body pillow . I , I , I ordered it for Karen .
 Butane ? Crème brûlée .
 Father Pete 's bringing a guest over .
 Hospice ?
 Poor guy 's been living in the church basement .
 You , uh ... need a hand bringing the bed down ?
 Oh , no , no , no . I can , I can do it . I can help .

 Fuck .
 Hey .
 The skinheads again ?
 Mandy 's dad heard the news .
 You and Mickey ?
 Mandy -- pregnant .
 Oh .
 Well , congratulations . - I didn 't know you switched teams . - Yeah .
 Or was it just a late night -- - stuck it in the wrong Milkovich ?
 - He told Linda he 's gonna put my feet in that meat slicer , work his way up .
 Linda call the cops ? Think she wants the place firebombed ?
 Huh .
 Mandy say whose it is ?
 Won 't call me back .
 Try checking the school .
 Yeah , Linda assured me that if I leave the place how it is , then I 'm gonna be out of a job , and anyway , she 's not going to be there .
 She usually goes into hiding until her dad cools off .
 Spider hole in Tikrit ?
 Relatives on South Justine .
 Went by , but her aunt wouldn 't let me in .
 How 's the homeless shelter ?
 On the 14th floor of the Ritz , so not bad .
 Staying with Steve . Great view .
 - Skyline ? - That , too .
 Ah , right , Steve 's wife .
 Surprised you can still lift that arm .
 That 's gonna come out of my pay .
 Relax .
 Got to go meet Steve .
 Try not to knock up any more chicks while I 'm gone , all right ?

 Steve 's flying in the wife 's boyfriend ?
 Can 't say he hasn 't been working his elfin ass off , trying to win you back .
 Holy shit , bury the lead . Something you want to tell me ?
 My morning ritual -- get mounted by Kev , pee on a stick .
 He won 't leave for work without it . - Weeks now .
 - Jesus , these things - are expensive . - Tell me about it .
 Thought anything involving his dick and my honeypot would be the easy part .
 You worried ?
 Thought Kev had defective balls , but he got it checked out .
 Little swimmers could qualify for the Junior Olympics . When was the last time spread 'em ?
 For a doctor ?
 Been forever . Couldn 't be me .
 I 've had so many abortions , the next one 's free .
 Isn 't there a neglected child that needs you somewhere ?
 Thinking about taking the day off .
 Who 's running the asylum ? Monica .
 Seems like she 's doing better .
 Taking her meds ? She says so .
 I know it 's not gonna last , but maybe I can get a few good months - before she crashes . - You should go see Meg .
 Down at the club ?
 Didn 't she say she had something for you -- a regular job ?
 Yeah .
 That lady doctor still at the clinic -- Sausage Fingers ?
 Liam , you did such a great job with your ... shot .
 What did I promise ? Brave boys ... ... get a sucker .
 Frank ! I 'm back ! You up ?
 How about pancakes ? Hungry ?
 " Squirrel fund " ?
 Hello ...

 Snort or swallow ? Both !
 Oh , nine , four , three- eight ...
 So , when was Marco supposed to arrive ?
 Should be here by now .
 Oh , nine , four , three , eight , four ... four , one , six .
 There 's got to be an easier way to smuggle him in .
 A billion Chinese can 't be wrong .
 Man , how long is this gonna take ? Really ?
 Is there somewhere you need to be ?
 Yeah , Ian 's in some trouble . Here .
 Thought you wanted this . Quickest grand you ever made .
 What 's that , for the phone hacking ?
 Oh , buyer was thrilled , said you should moonlight for the NSA .
 Use it as a down payment on your own place .
 Why do that when I could have a rich father- in- law to leech off of like you ?
 Seriously , you want to be on your own , you got to start saving .
 Ricky , there 's no more containers in this aisle .
 10, 000 easy get lost at sea every year .
 Well , is it possible the container could have got put in a different lane ?
 Let me see that ?
 Yo , Steve , you sure these are fours ? They look like nines .
 Yo , Marco , bit of a problem .
 Uh , you want to call me back when you get this ?
 Marco !
 Marco !
 Yo , Marco !
 Marco !
 Marco !
 Marco !
 Fucking Raoul .
 12 hundred dollars for an ounce of coke .
 - For his shitty coke ?
 - Yeah . It 's like Drano going up your nose .
 Offered it for $1, 150 if I blew him .
 What else ... What else did you get ?
 Oh .
 Wheels ?
 It took six security guards to kick us out of there .
 It took three just to climb over the rail and get you away from that zebra .
 I thought it was a unicorn .
 I swear , I saw a ... What were we on ?
 Hit me . Oxy or ... Bennie ?
 - Bennie . - Bennie ? There you go .
 Why anyone
 - would go to the zoo sober ...
 - Hey . You having fun back there ?
 Where 's the Special K ?
 - I skipped it . - Skipped ... Why ?
 If I wanted to feel dead , I would take my meds .
 It was the one thing I asked for !
 You selfish bitch ! God ...
 Stop the car ! You 're fucking driving !
 - Get out ! - No !
 Then I 'm fucking getting out !
 This is just like you ! Excuse me for fucking sharing !
 Always your conditions ! I had to deal with Raoul .
 Oh , there it is . Trying to cut my nuts off .
 No ! Don 't you talk about cutting ! Not my fault your parents did a number on you .
 Oh , like the psychotic bitch who raised you
 - was Mother of the Year ! - May that psychotic bitch rest in peace !
 Fuck you ! Oh , yeah ? Well ... fuck you !
 Wait .
 Where you going ?
 Monica ?
 Monica ? ! Fuck ! Christ !
 Get the fuck back , Terry . I 've got a shotgun !
 Not Terry .
 Fuck you want ?
 Hi .
 I 'm- I 'm ... I 'm Lip , Mandy 's friend .
 - Mandy ain 't here . - Oh , yeah . I- I need to talk to her .
 No visitors .
 Could you just go inside - and tell her it 's me ?
 - Could you step back before I spray your organs all over my goddamn yard ?
 Now , fuck off !
 Mandy ?
 Look , you got to call your dad off , all right ?
 Get him to leave Ian alone !
 Just .
 Tell him the truth , you know , even if it mine .
 If your dad needs to kill someone , tell him he can come after me !
 I thought you had kids - to take care of . - The situation changed .
 Oh , I wish it had changed before I hired someone else .
 Got to give them the spiel .
 Hey , no nips , no lips , no handies . This isn 't a strip club .
 You still opening that new place ? Belle Epoque .
 More Gucci , less Axe Body Spray .
 - Is there anything for me there ? - I wish .
 I can do more than waitress . I 've bartended .
 We 're staffed up . Completely ?
 Just need someone to run the upper bar .
 Well , I can do that . Looking for someone who can promote a night .
 Well , I 'm getting my GED .
 Look , no one 's gonna pay 1, 000 bucks for a $20 bottle of vodka unless the service is impeccable .
 You ever managed ?
 Overseen inventory , budgeting ?
 Look , I got too much on my plate to baby- sit . - Sorry .
 - Worth a shot . Thanks .
 Deb ?
 Debbie ?
 Hi .
 How was school today ?
 Who 'd you steal it from ? We bought it . Come on , get in !
 Now !
 Come on !
 Where 's Frank ?
 Do you want to go shopping ?
 Oh , pretty girls day out !
 Sure . Come on , let 's go .
 Whoa ! I got it .
 Come on !
 Fucking NAFTA !
 Ah ...

 No . No .
 No .
 Ooh !
 Marco ?
 Where the fuck am I ? !

 I 've been trying to reach you .

 Take small breaths .
 Have anydea where you are ? Can you hear anything ?

 I 'm trying my best , Marco . Okay ?
 Ration your food , like those Chilean miners .
 Only needed a couple bites of tuna a day to survive .
 Hey , beautiful .
 Don 't pass that one up right there .
 Do a twirl .
 No .
 Hello .
 Marco ?
 Hey .
 Oh .
 Surprise .
 - Sheila , Ruben . - Oh .
 - Got shot by his pimp . - Ooh .
 - Infection in his spine .
 - Oh .
 - Hi . - Oh , he can 't hear you .
 - Oh .
 - Deaf since birth . Says that 's why he started sucking a crack pipe .
 I 'm proud to say young Ruben 's come to see the Lord does not accept excuses in exchange for first- class transportation upstairs .
 Been clean a year now .
 - Father , just a moment , please ? - Of course .
 He came to us three years ago during one of our winter nights for the homeless . - Yeah .
 - Hung on a lot longer than any of us expected . Saints be praised .
 No , that wasn 't what I ...
 Weust can 't afford to keep him any longer . - Oh .
 - State cutbacks . You 'll receive $50 a day for food and whatever else he needs , but let 's just say ,
 I 'm not going to be making any surprise visits .
 Father , I 've ...
 I 've ... done a terrible thing .
 I don 't ... recognize myself anymore .
 When I look in the mirror , it 's like another ... person is staring back at me , and I 'm ...
 I 'm just ... I 'm lost .
 Your purpose in life was to build a happy family , and you achieved that .
 And now , your husband 's passed , and your daughter 's ready to fly the nest , but you 're still needed .
 This is your purpose now .
 Hi , Ruben .
 I 'm Sheila .
 Okay , great . Yeah , this will be great .
 Hey , sweetheart , is everything okay ?
 Mandy 's dad came looking for me at school .
 Are you all right ?
 Managed to duck out before he saw me .
 What 's with the dolls ? Took Debbie shopping ; I missed her last birthday .
 And we couldn 't decide which doll to get , so we got them all !
 I 'll get the other load . There 's more ?
 Didn 't have the heart to tell her , I don 't play with dolls anymore .
 She practically filled the car .
 Car ?
 - You bought a car ? - Hey , how was your trigonometry midterm ?
 C- minus .
 Great , you passed ! I can kiss West Point good- bye .
 West Point ?
 I was hoping to get in , not that I 'll live long enough now to go .
 Well , if you know you want to be in the Army , why are you wasting your time with school ?
 Join up .
 What are we waiting for ?
 Happy birthday .
 Come on , let 's go .
 The ship 's called the It 's based out of Mexico . - Lip ?
 - Yup ? - Focus .
 - I am focusing on the nude woman getting a spray tan in your bedroom .
 She 's trying to lose her tan lines - before Marco gets here .
 - It 's a noble endeavor - I fully endorse .
 - And a complete waste of time if we do not track down Marco 's ship and find out where he is ; he is calling me in four hours .
 I need to give him good news .
 What , you didn 't telt her we lost him ?
 No .
 Well , it would be a shame if he didn 't make it , but , you know , naturally , I 'd step up ,
 - be there to comfort her . - All right , cut the shit , Lip ; I lose Marco , I lose Fiona .
 Okay , okay , okay .
 Um ...
 All right , so the ship
 - should be stopping to pick up extra cargo .
 - Where is it ? Uh , be in Cleveland tonight .
 Cleveland ! Cleveland ?
 Yeah , so take him to the Rock ' n Roll Hall of Fame , but now , do me a favor , get the fuck out of my way ?
 Thank you .
 Ever been outside of Chicago ?
 Army sent me all over the world .
 I ate a croissant outside the Eiffel Tower and pizza in Rome . So the other branches are here , too , huh ?
 Yes , ma 'am .
 And we 'll train you , too , so when you finish your service , you can secure a good- paying job back home .
 So , what 're they playing ? That looks fun .
 America 's Army 3 .
 We could use more bright , young men like you .
 How soon can I ship out ? Okay .
 So , U. S. citizen , right ?
 - Ever been convicted of a crime ? - Uh , no , sir .
 What year you graduate ?
 I 'm a junior .
 In high school ?
 Gonna have to come and see me when you got your diploma .
 What ? You 're turning him down ?
 He needs to be a high school graduate . - Why ?
 - The rules , ma 'am , I 'm sorry .
 - Fuck the rules . Sign him up .
 - Ma 'am , I 'm sorry , but it 's really ....
 He wants to serve his country !
 Finish school . - Let 's stay in touch .
 - Since when do you have to know trigonometry to get killed for your country ?
 You gonna send him out to do multiplication or kill towel heads ?
 - All right , Mom ...
 - Geez , no wonder you can 't win a fucking war . - All right , thanks for your time .
 - Because of shit heads like you that we 're all gonna be eating egg rolls and speaking slant- eye .
 Army too chicken shit ? Fuck you !
 We 're going to the Navy .
 Veronica , I got 20 minutes left in my break .
 That should give us enough time to go three times , easy . I just ate .
 Mmm , that 's okay . I 'll do all the work .
 - Maybe later .
 - Oh , come on , the best part about making a baby is , you get to have sex while we 're doing it .
 Not likely .
 What 're you talking about ? Making a baby .
 Baby , I told you , the ball doctor said - we 're good to go .
 - Talking about me . Went to the clinic today .
 Said me having kids -- " not likely . "
 PlD .
 Is that bad ?
 Bad enough .
 It 's gonna be okay , baby .
 Never really wanted them anyway .
 What ? What do you mean ?
 I like things the way they are . Why change ?
 - It 's what we wanted . - Not what I wanted .
 We talked about it .
 I was just telling you what you wanted to hear .
 Oh , so you were lying ?
 You calling me a liar ? Maybe if you lied about it .
 Maybe you were too busy thinking about what you wanted .
 Oh , so now you 're calling me selfish ?
 You know what , congratulations .
 You just got everything you wanted all along .
 Fuck , that hurt !
 All right , GED practice test next week , and remember knives count as weapons , so please leave them at home .
 I 'm looking at you , Miguel and Shontasia . Who ?
 Me ?
 Hi . - Fiona Gallagher , uh ... - Mm- hmm .
 Wondering if there 's anything more I should be doing .
 Only the second class .
 Anything I could be studying at home ?
 Why 'd you drop out of high school ?
 I didn 't have time .
 Mm- hmm ?
 Family thing .
 What are you going to do with your GED ?
 I was tossing around the idea of club restaurant managment , but I found out I 'm under qualified .
 I 'm afraid the GED only takes you so far nowadays .
 Didn 't mention that in your opening remarks .
 They encourage us not to .
 Guess I need to aim a little lower . Massage therapist ?
 You 're here because there 's a gap in your education , not your intelligence .
 You live near Daley College ?
 The JC ? They offer a range of business courses .
 They have scholarships , financial aid .
 You can take classes while holding down a full- time job .
 You have the time now ?
 I might , yeah .
 Don 't have to aim low .
 You 're only my second patient .
 My first one died . So , one for one .
 Aw .
 Do you , um ...
 Do you want me to ... to ... end your suffering ?
 You want me to ...
 You st say the word , and I 'll ...
 Yes ?
 Was that a yes ?
 Yeah , it was just hard to hear .
 Maybe if you plug the hole with your finger ?
 Okay , bit of a whistle . Maybe try the thumb .
 Hungry ? Oh , yes !
 I have something special .
 Yes , you just wait right there .
 Um , hey !
 Look what I have .
 Crème brûlée .
 Would you like some ?
 Okay .
 Let 's see .
 If I put this in your mouth , is it just gonna spill out that hole ?
 Monica !
 I 'm in here .
 I 'm replacing the shelf paper . It 's gonna look great in here .
 What ? Want to apologize ?
 For what ? For leaving me in fucking Indiana somewhere !
 I should 've hit you with the car .
 Walked ten , 15 miles .
 You must be tired . Froze my ass off .
 How about a bath ?
 I 'll run you a bath .
 And then after , we can do what we do best .
 We don 't have an eight ball . Not that .
 Sex ? A kid .
 Oh , Frank .
 Let 's do it ; who are we to deny the world another shining Gallagher star ?
 We had one kid on coke . - Debbie .
 - It was Carl . No , Carl was E.
 Thought Liam was E. Liam was acid .
 - Don 't you remember ? - Yeah .
 Christmas Eve , I got it from that bail- bond guy ?
 We had our own rave . Till the kids came downstairs asking for fucking gifts .
 But we 've never made a little rug rat on GHB .
 Aw ...
 Yeah . Yeah , let 's do it .
 Not in my room .
 Need to get shit- faced ; don 't want to do it alone .
 I 'll pour , you talk . I 'll get the cups .
 What do you want ? I have to cancel our date .
 - What date ? - I 'm sorry . Just keep tomorrow night free , okay ?
 I- I got to go .
 You find the ship ?
 Thank you .
 There 's nothing on it .
 I guess they unloaded it already . Where are the containers ?
 How the fuck should I know ?
 Fuck .
 Easy . Fuck .
 Is that Linda 's ?
 It already shot one Milkovich .
 Look , I think I got a way we can get rid of Mandy 's dad .
 Don 't even have to fire a bullet .
 He 's on parole , right ? Kidnapping and grand theft auto .
 All right , so what do you think the cops would do if they found one of those in his house ?
 Linda will know if we took it . Grammy 's 9mm ?
 He could get six years . Yeah , or life .
 Serial numbers aren 't scratched off .
 Gun 's bound to have racked up a body count . All we have to do is plant it .
 I got nothing to lose . Bombed the trig midterm .
 How bad ? I tried to enlist .
 - What ?
 - Monica took me .
 Figured Mandy 's dad couldn 't kill me in Kabul .
 Yeah , well , there 's plenty of fucking Muslims who could .
 Well , they all turned me down .
 The Army , the Navy , Marines , Air Force .
 Still got the Coast Guard .
 It 's my fucking funeral .
 Look , just ... lay low until tomorrow morning , okay ?
 Don 't forget the gun .
 On top of managing the upstairs bar , I could 've gotten my own night to promote .
 Why are we talking about a job you didn 't get ?
 - I really wanted it .
 - Don 't spend time thinking about things you can 't have .
 Doctor didn 't say it was impossible .
 Close to it .
 Since when do you take no for an answer ?
 Since when do you ?
 ♪ How can I just let you walk away ? ♪ ♪ Just let you leave without a trace ♪ ♪ When I stand here taking every breath ♪ ♪ With you , ooh . ♪

 Sheila , you 're the only one who really knew me at all .
 Wake up , baby , come on , Mommy needs your help .
 Where is Ian ?
 Come on , it 's going to be fun .
 Debbie , don 't forget your father .
 Thanks for letting me talk your ear off last night , Fi .
 I 'll tell her when she gets back .
 Where the hell did she go this early ?
 Hey , he 's still in there .
 - They leave a key anywhere ? - Door 's unlocked .
 - Who would be crazy enough to break in ? - Right .
 You bring Grammy 's gun ?
 Remember to wipe your prints off .
 There he is .
 Where should we plant it ?
 Maybe beside all the others .
 Jesus .
 It 's like bringing a joint to a crack house .
 What the fuck ?
 Huh ? !
 Gonna fucking waste - your Peter Pan ass . - Put it down .
 What the fuck you doing ? - Let him go .
 - The little shit broke in .
 - Wait , he 's not the dad . - He knows .
 The fuck I do . I told you whose it is .
 Let him go , Dad . This is between us .
 Your dad ?
 Another word and I 'll blow your brains all over the fucking linoleum .
 What are you doing down here ?
 I didn 't want to sleep in our bed without you .
 Your eyes are red .
 I couldn 't sleep .
 You ?
 I 'll go first . No , me .
 I called you a liar . Only 'cause I am .
 Said I didn 't want kids . I did .
 Yeah .
 You know , there are lots of kids who need a home .
 Fucked up foster kids like me ?
 Exactly . We could build up our own army like Wesley Snipes , take over the neighborhood .

 You know , no one said that we have to stop trying . Oh ...
 - Come here .
 - Whoo !
 I am going to slit your throat with a motherfucking can opener !
 I have no food .
 My fucking phone is dying , man .
 I am trying to find you ! Estefania , please !
 You were on your way to a Costco in Georgia but got rerouted .
 I don 't care , man , don 't fucking care .
 Listen , I just finish an hour conversation with my brother , and he 's dead 12 years .
 Get me out of here ! Will you give it a rest ? !
 Hello ?
 Fuck !
 You -- dead man .
 What are you doing ?
 What does it look like ? I 'm steam- cleaning the rug .
 I rented it from Jewel- Osco .
 When 's the last time you think this has been cleaned ?
 How many miles did you run ?
 Uh , four . You 'll be up to six in no time .
 Yeah , take a shower while there 's still hot water .
 Hey , Carl . Carl ?
 Hey , just want a second with Mandy , okay ?
 Will you need this ?
 I 'll see you later . Yep .
 So ...
 When 'd you get home ?
 Last night .
 Hmm .
 He drinks and mistakes me for Mom .
 Only once in a while . Not like it 's a big deal .
 Watch the fucking look on your face .
 A Gallagher looking down on me -- I don 't think so .
 Why 'd he think it was me ?
 He blacks out ... forgets .
 Lip better keep his mouth shut .
 He will .
 I just wish the whole thing would go away .
 We can make it .
 You got $600 lying around ? We can raise it .
 The money , not the baby .
 You 'd do that ?
 You 're my girlfriend .
 Anthony Bourdain ?
 Sanjay Gupta .
 Nancy Grace ! There 's got to be a missing white girl somewhere .
 Oh , Ruben , I 'm trying .
 No ? You don 't want TV , you don 't eat .
 Do you have a wish before you go , anything I can get you ?
 Yeah ?
 Oh , oh , I don 't , I- I 'm not sure what you mean .
 Oh ...
 Milk , eggs . Aw .
 Hey , bro . He can 't hear you .
 Is it getting cold out there ?
 Could use a shower .
 Oh , uh , that 's not a good idea .
 Hey , I ...
 Uh , okay , I 'll tell her .
 So I spent the last few months learning baby sign language .
 He says he hates crème brûlée .
 - Gives him the runs .
 - Oh , I noticed that . Is there anything he does like ?
 Uh , what do you want to eat ?
 Know how to make cake ?
 Strawberry shortcake . Strawberry shortcake ?
 Oh .
 No , he says , " Fuck that . "
 Vanilla cake with a shitload of Grand Marnier .
 Hey , you need to watch your language , bro .
 Uh , there 's one more thing before he kicks it .
 Uh ...
 Want to fuck .
 Hey , out of line , bro ! That 's a lady right there .
 What 'd he say ? He 's sorry .
 He 'll settle for something else .
 Oh .
 Put everything but the Cristal in the cooler .
 I want the job .
 Fiona ... You asked if I 've managed before .
 Yeah , a houseful of kids .
 Taught me how to smack with one hand while giving a pat on the back with the other .
 Inventory , budgeting .
 Go grocery shopping for a family of six with what 's in my pocket , then let 's talk .
 At some point , somebody saw that you were more than a cage dancer and they took a chance on you .
 I can do this .
 I got a pre- opening event tonight .
 Things move fast , got to keep up . I will .
 All right , let 's give it a shot .
 That 's what managers wear .
 Pick out your size . I got to go audition DJs .
 I 'm gonna kick ass , Meg .
 All right , I 'll see you at 9 : 00 .
 Okay , cool . Yeah , thanks , man .
 Kev says we 're all set - for the Alibi .
 - Why do we even have to do - this stupid fund- raiser ?
 - Mandy needs our help . Got more chocolate chip cookies .
 Every buck counts , right ? Who wants another batch ?
 Peanut butter , toffee ?
 Where is the tape ? Can 't find anything in this kitchen .
 When are we moving the furniture back ?
 Oh , Debbie , I love your poster .
 Who did you get your artistic talent from ?
 Who wants to sample a cookie ?
 Me .
 Uh , they 're for the fund- raiser .
 Blood sugar is dipping , trying to keep up with your mother . She is wearing me out .
 I 'm done with the flyer .

 Uh , it 's " fund- raiser , " not " fun razor . "
 Want 'em to show up , make 'em think someone 's getting cut .
 All right , make copies , man .
 Oh , I 'll take him .
 Come on , you and me , Carl . We can take the new car .
 Can 't get enough Carl and Mommy time .
 Do you need some new clothes ? We could stop at JCPenney .
 I can drive . Do you have a license ?
 Mom 's never going to shampoo the rug , is she ?
 Will you calm down , okay ?
 Just will you sit down and take a seat ?
 Okay , if I hear what you were saying , I 'm sure that it 's great , but can you see that I am trying my best ?
 You !
 Where have you been ? !
 I 'm not on fucking retainer .
 Okay , Marco 's disappeared . He 's on a truck somewhere , no idea where .
 That 's not good .
 Whoa , you know Portuguese ?
 Yeah , it 's like Italian .
 She says if you don 't find Marco alive , she 's gonna call her father .
 Okay .
 I hope you 're not wed to your eyes or your ... tongue .
 Or your dick .
 Here , hold this .
 No , no , no , no , no . Who are you calling ?
 I got a Teamster friend in local 710 .
 Yeah , yo , Tully .
 I 'm looking for a container one of your drivers is hauling .
 Uh- huh .
 Yeah , sure I can hold .
 Oh , shit , Carl . Carl . Come on .
 Switch places .
 Quick .
 Quick .
 Hi .
 You 're supposed to have your seatbelt on .
 Think these 'll match ? - Mm- hmm .
 - What are you looking up ? Nothing .
 It 's my computer . You don 't know how to do private browsing . I 'll check the history later .
 Richard Daley College ?
 Just seeing what 's out there .
 You got to get Lip back in high school first before you got any shot of getting him to college .
 Actually , it 's for me .
 I pass my GED next month , I can enroll for January .
 I could fit in two classes a day before I 'd have to be at the club .
 Study up on marketing , I could be promoting my own night before the end of the semester .
 Good for you , Fi . Why didn 't you just say so ?
 I thought you was looking at Kev dick pics .
 Hey , Gallagher . Seen Fiona ? I 've been looking for her .
 Why , what 's up ? Your mom 's down at the station .
 Bring bail money .
 Dying wish .
 How are we gonna feed it to him ?
 Oh .
 Think he wants another hit .
 He worked so hard to get clean .
 Sometimes it 's not worth holding out .
 Life 's too short . Why not just give in ?
 Christ .
 I 'm not here for your stash . I need bail money . I only have a grand .
 You have a grand ?
 - Where 's the Squirrel Fund ?
 - What the hell is a Squirrel Fund ?
 Empty your fucking pockets .
 You talk to your father that way ?
 Get the fucking key and get me out of here !
 I want my phone call !
 Get my lawyer , Rodney King your asses .
 Your brother was driving . He got a nasty bump , but he 'll be fine .
 I told my captain your mom was driving under the influence .
 You feel powerful locking me up ?
 She 's not making it easy .
 I 'm not invisible !
 Hey , buddy , you doing okay ?
 Do you hear me ? I 'm right here .
 I 'm right here . Here !
 What the fuck is this ?
 We 're raising money .
 For Mandy . $25 , all the well drinks you want .
 Hey , guys , you got ten minutes to sign up for the pool tournament , five dollar entry fee ; bragging rights are at stake .
 Hey , thanks for all your help , Kev .
 Yeah , too many Gallaghers in the world already .
 Lip , now you ?
 Instead of passing rubbers out at schools , they should be passing them out at your house .
 Hey , Debbie . Cookies ? Oh .
 We have dollar a cookie , buck 50 a brownie , 70 for the gun .
 Oh , hey , how 'd you get so many people here ?
 Told them the proceeds go to a great cause .
 It 's for a church retreat .
 Kids with cleft palates .
 Here .
 The NRA .
 The resistance against the Zionist occupation .
 Hmm .
 Hey , wow , you look great .
 Where 's Pele ?
 Florida , sunshine state .
 Heading to the airport , just wanted to stop by and ask for another rain check .
 Rain check ?
 Yeah . Tomorrow I 'm all yours , okay ?
 Who says I want you ?
 Where the fuck have you been ?
 Oh , what , you back for good or just visiting ?
 Just bailed Monica out of jail .
 What ? Why ?
 Cops and their fucking quotas , why do you think ?
 She let Carl play bumper cars with a Buick .
 Is he okay ? " Is he okay ? "
 What about your mother ? She birthed your ungrateful asses .
 I 'm late for a meeting .
 They said Carl 's gonna be fine , but it 's hard to tell because he 's - normally concussed more than he isn 't .
 - Well , don 't let him fall asleep .
 What , you 're AWOL this whole time , now you 're giving orders ?
 - I was around . - Really ?
 So you know Monica spent all the Squirrel Fund money ?
 You know what , I wouldn 't have even had the cash to bail her out if I didn 't return a bunch of dolls I found in Debbie 's room !
 The first rule you learn in this house , you hide the goddamn money .
 - She seemed better . - Look at this place .
 The sofa is in the kitchen .
 For fuck 's sake , she tried to get Ian to enlist .
 She what ?
 What did you think was gonna happen , Fiona ?
 Thought it might be different this time .
 Hm , well , how 'd that Kool- Aid taste going down ?
 Where is she ?
 You could 've gotten Carl killed !
 You tried to get Ian into the army ? !
 You promised me .
 Get out of bed !
 Get out of bed , Mom !
