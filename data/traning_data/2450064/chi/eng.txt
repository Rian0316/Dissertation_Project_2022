 00 : 00 : 02, 060 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 278 ( disco music playing ) Try to keep up , Howard !
 I 'm killing it !
 Yeah , I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now .
 Don 't worry , this is exactly how you look when you 're dancing in clubs .
 You 're welcome , ladies .
 Paradigm- shifting news , gentlemen ! ( music stops ) Dude !

 I was about to Bollywood this bitch .
 Earlier today , I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends .
 Moments ago , he accepted my request .
 Do you understand what that means ?
 That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying , ( imitating Stephen Hawking ) :
 " Damn it .
 I meant to click no . "
 I 'll walk you through it .
 The game is not called Words with Strangers . No , it 's not even called
 Words with Acquaintances . It is called
 Words with ...
 I 'm not finishing your sentence .
 You pulled the plug on my funk .
 Friends !
 It 's Words with Friends !
 Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are .
 Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide ;
 I 'll have everything I 've ever wanted since I was six years old .
 That 's really nice , Sheldon .
 I 'm happy for you . And I 'm happy for you , too .
 You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking .
 Enjoy it , boys .
 You may have peaked .
 Sheldon , I know Stephen Hawking .
 I worked with him .
 And if they ever come out with a game called
 Words with People You Once Worked with , you 'll be off to the races .

 Sheldon , I don 't think this actually means ... ( tablet chimes ) Hold that thought !
 Professor Hawking has made a move .
 Boy , oh , boy .
 Oh , it 's only a matter of time before we 're coming up with fun nicknames for each other .
 I 'll be Coop .
 He 'll be Wheels .
 If he 's okay with that . All right .

 Original Air Date on November 1 , 2012
 So , I was taking a shower this morning , and when I got out , I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be
 Howard 's mom 's underwear .
 I had to take another shower .
 It wasn 't enough .

 Nothing will ever be enough .
 I once looked in Sheldon 's underwear drawer .
 He yelled at me .
 But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away .
 There 's a book under here .
 Oh , I 'll get that .
 I got it .
 I got it .
 No , no , it 's ...
 Why do you have a history textbook ?
 It 's not a big deal . Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College .

 That 's great .
 I didn 't know you wanted to go back to school .
 It 's just one history class .
 Look , I didn 't finish college , so I thought I would give it a try .
 Not to mention , your acting career is going south like Sherman .
 Read about it in your book .
 Why would you be embarrassed to tell us ?
 No , I 'm not embarrassed .
 I just didn 't want anyone to know because I haven 't told Leonard yet .
 Why wouldn 't you tell Leonard ?
 Because it 's me going back to school , and he 's gonna be all " you can do it , " and " how can I help ? " and " I 'm so proud of you . "
 Ugh !
 I just can 't believe you could keep something like that from him .
 You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know .
 Really ?
 You can 't think of anyone weirder ?
 I can , ( whispers ) : but she 's sitting right there .
 Yes ! I play the word " quiver " with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points .
 That ought to let the air out of your tires , Hawking .
 Wow , my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn 't smell like tar .
 Everything really is coming up Amy .
 It is glorious . One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits .
 And I 'm spanking him so hard his grad students won 't be able to sit down .
 You know , when one male dominates another , his testosterone level rises .
 What 's your point ?
 It 's exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level .
 ( tablet chimes ) Ooh ! My friend Stephen just played the word " act " for 18 points .
 That 's right , I call him Stephen now .
 Because I checked , and he was not okay with Wheels . Oh , you could turn his " act " into " extract , " and it would be for double points .
 Amy .
 Why would you give me a word ?
 Now , if I play " extract " it would be cheating .
 Sorry . Although , I could play the completely unrelated and better word " extract "

 Ethical conundrum avoided .
 Thanks , brain .
 Spaghetti okay ?
 It 's crunchy .
 Just the way I like it .
 Yeah , I don 't think the water was really boiling .
 It 's great .
 I love it . ( chuckles )
 Okay , listen , there 's something I need to tell you .
 I 've been thinking about going back to school for a while now . So a couple months ago , I started taking a history class at the community college .
 Oh .
 That 's great ! Great , great , great !
 Why wait so long to tell me ?
 I don 't want you to make a big deal out of it .
 Why do you think I 'd be like that ?
 I get it , you 're taking one class . It 's nice .
 Maybe if it goes well , you take another , you enroll full- time . Ooh , be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four- year college .

 You 're making it a big deal . Sorry .
 Whatever .
 It 's all good .
 Anyway , that 's it .
 I just thought you should know .
 Am I allowed to ask how the class is going ?
 It 's really good .
 We 've been talking about the origins of slavery .
 Turn in my first paper tomorrow .
 Great topic . I can help with that . There are lots of different perspectives you can take : economic , sociological , political ...
 Hey , this is my paper .
 And my perspective is that slavery is bad .
 Oh , and my professor 's black , so I 'm pretty sure that 's the right answer .
 Can I take a look ?
 No , Leonard , this is my thing . Okay , I get it .
 Thank you . It 's like when I started doing chin- ups ;
 I didn 't want you to see until I could do one .
 FYl , really close .
 Thank you .
 Now behave yourself and eat your dinner .
 Maybe later , if you 're lucky , you get to sleep with a college girl .
 Really ? ' Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school , that never happened once .
 I think the next time I have to speak to a call center in India ,
 I 'm going to try using an American accent .

 Why ? Because when I use my regular voice ,
 I feel like I 'm making fun of them .

 That 's ridiculous .
 Not to mention , your American accent is terrible .
 Dude , my accent is brilliant . ( American accent ) : Hey , my snow- white American friends ,
 let 's put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we 're all obese .
 This is what you sound like . ( imitating Koothrappali ) :
 I think I 'm talking in an American accent , but it really sounds like
 I 'm wearing a set of giant dentures .
 Sheldon , do I really sound like that ?
 ( imitating Koothrappali ) :
 Tell him he sounds like that . Sheldon , you okay ?
 It 's been three days .
 Why hasn 't Stephen Hawking played a word ?
 The guy 's a genius .
 Maybe you weren 't challenging enough for him .
 Not challenging ?
 I was humiliating the man .
 I was thinking of writing a book called the Time I Made Stephen Hawking
 There 's the problem .
 You can 't beat Hawking like that .
 He hates to lose .
 Everyone knows the guy 's a big baby .
 I mean , forget the wheelchair , he should be in a stroller .

 Really ? One time when I was working with him , he said that Johnny Depp was in
 I told him he was wrong , but he kept insisting .
 So I looked it up online and showed him . Well , the next day , he had a pizza party , and everyone got invited but me .
 " Your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix . " And then he was all , ( imitating Stephen Hawking ) :

 Good Lord , what have I done ?
 ( American accent ) :
 Good Lord , what have I done ?
 Terrible .
 All right , hotshot , let 's hear your Indian . I can 't sit on that elephant , ass is on fire from eating all this curry . ( Indian accent ) :

 Okay , yeah , that 's pretty good .

 Please be good .
 Please be good .
 Uh- huh .
 Uh- huh .
 Okay .
 She writes like she cooks .
 Play . Play .
 Play .
 Play . Play .
 What are you doing ?
 Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking .
 Play . Play .
 Oh ...
 He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something .
 I did a bad thing .
 Does it affect me ? No . Then suffer in silence .
 Play . Play . Play .
 ( knocking ) Stephen Hawking ...
 Stephen Hawking ...
 Stephen Hawking .
 Penny started taking a class .
 She wrote a paper , she didn 't want me to read it ,
 I went behind her back and I read it anyway .
 Stephen Hawking hates me .
 I don 't know what to do .
 I mean , the paper 's terrible .
 But if I tell her , she 'll know that I read it and she 'll get really mad .
 I was beating him so bad , he doesn 't want to be friends anymore .
 Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking ?
 Is it possible we 're having two different conversations ? How would I know ?
 I 'm not listening to you . Hang on .

 Okay .
 Here 's what we 're gonna do .
 Chess clock . We each get five minutes to talk about our problems . We 'll take turns .
 Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend .
 Begin .
 I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends .
 He stopped playing .
 And now we 're not friends anymore .
 He 's probably busy .
 You 're worried about nothing .
 Give it a couple more days .
 I 'm sure he 'll play , and you 'll see that everything 's fine . My turn .
 I can 't let Penny hand in a bad paper , but how do I tell her it 's bad without letting her know that I read it ?
 Hmm . Beats me . Now ...
 I know Hawking 's not busy because I can see he 's playing other people right now .
 Maybe since you 're so good , he 's taking his time to meet the challenge .
 I want Penny to enjoy school ...
 Wolowitz told me he 's a big baby !
 But I didn 't know that , and I played " extract " for 82 points .
 It 's all Amy 's fault . She told me to play it .
 I have got to cut her loose .
 Sheldon , I wasn 't done talking .
 She hands in the paper tomorrow .
 I know I could help her .
 And she 's my girlfriend ...
 I- I should be allowed to help her . Why aren 't I allowed to help her ?
 Yeah , I hear you , brother .
 No .
 You need to give me some advice .
 Fine .
 Women , huh ? No ...

 Specific to my situation .
 Blonde women , huh ?
 Empathetic !
 It sucks to be you .
 I quit .
 Leonard , wait . No . I listened to your dumb thing .

 Leonard , come back .
 Leonard , come back .
 Leonard , come back .
 What ?
 Oh , of course , it only works on the weak- minded .

 ( singsongy ) :
 Good morning , sunshine .
 Leonard .
 It 's 8 : 00 a . m . It 's like the middle of the night .
 I know , but I have to go to work , and I made you breakfast .
 Oh , wow , that 's so sweet . Hey , what 's this ?
 Uh , before you open that , um , are you familiar with the story of " The Shoemaker and the Elves " ?
 Elves ?
 Come on , Leonard .
 - It 's too early for - No , no . Listen , um ...
 Once upon a time , there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night , elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him .
 And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning , he- he would be super happy , not mad at the elves
 Open it . Okay .
 ( clears throat ) " An examination of the economic , cultural , and political roots of slavery in the Old South :
 1619 to 1865 . "
 What the hell is this ?
 Don 't ask me . A little elf did it .
 So let me get this straight .
 You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me ?
 No , I assumed it would be good . Then I read it . What ? !
 No , I ...
 I mean , it was good .
 There were just a few things that needed a little polishing .
 W ... You changed every word . That 's not true .
 Uh ...
 " Slavery . "

 " 1619 , " your name at the top -- that 's all you .
 You are such an ass .
 This is exactly why I didn 't want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place .
 Please don 't be upset . I- I just ...
 I didn 't want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school .
 Right , because me being in school is so important to you .
 That way , you wouldn 't have to be dating someone who 's only a waitress .
 Oh , come on , you know that 's not true . Do I ?
 Listen to me .
 I need to do this on my own .
 If I fail , I fail .
 If I pass , I pass .
 Do you get it ? I 'm sorry . I was just trying to help .
 Yeah , well , next time don 't .
 Oh , and since you like stories so much , this is not " The Shoemaker and the Elves , " okay ?
 This is , " Give a man a fish , he eats it .
 " Teach a man to fish , he ... sells it or something . "
 Whatever , I don 't know !
 It 's just a lot better than what you did , you big jerk !
 ( door slams )
 You ever hear back from Hawking ?
 No .
 It would appear as if I 've lost him .
 Stupid brain .
 It 'll be okay .
 How can it be okay ?
 Stephen Hawking 's a genius and he talks like a robot . It 's everything I 've ever wanted in a friend .
 Yeah , but if he 's a sore loser , maybe you 're better off without him .
 You 're right .
 I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you .

 ( chime ) ( gasps ) He played !
 He played !
 Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again .
 He was okay with that nickname .
 So , now all you have to do is let him win . Yeah , way ahead of you .
 I will play the word " at " for two measly points , throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world .

 What are you waiting for ?
 Hit " send . "
 I can 't .
 Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest .
 So don 't do it . Oh , but I want to be Hawking 's friend . So do it .
 No , but if I do , I 'll be a phony , a sellout , a Hollywood poser .
 Then don 't do it .
 I won 't .
 This feels right .
 My mother always said , " To thine own self be true . "
 Good for you .
 ' Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat , so what does she know ?
 And send .


 Oh , hey . Haven 't heard from you in a couple days . You still mad at me ?
 Nope .
 I have no reason to ... " B " mad at you .
 Minus .
 ( chuckles )
 Wow .
 That 's right .
 On my paper .
 Not yours , mine , you punk- ass elf .
 I don 't know what to say .
 Hmm , how about , ( mockingly ) :
 " Gee , Penny , you 're smarter than I thought . " You may be the one in school ,
 " but I 'm the one who learned a lesson .
 I 'm so stupid , Penny .
 Duh ... "

 She sounds exactly like you !
 How 'd it go with Leonard ?
 ( sighs ) I don 't think he 'll be making that mistake again . Good .
 So ,
 I know this goes without saying , but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper ,
 I will beat you both with a bag of oranges .
 Got it . Understood . Now , ladies , we got a B- minus on this paper .
 I think if we put our heads together , on the next one we could get an " A. "
 Uh , but we got you a B- minus on purpose to make it believable .
 Believable ?
 You saying I 'm not smart ?
 No , no !
 You 're smart . That 's better .
 ( quietly ) :
 I feel like I 'm in high school again .
 Yeah , doing the prom queen 's homework so she 'll like us .
 I know .
 It 's finally working .

 ( phone rings )
 It 's Stephen Hawking .
 ( stutters ) Answer it .
 I want to hear .
 Professor Hawking , how nice of you to call .
 Hello .
 I really enjoyed our game , Dr. Cooper .
 Oh , me , too .
 Or should I say Dr. Loser ?
 Ha , ha , ha .

 Yes , congratulations .
 You won fair and square .
 Uh , very impressive , sir .
 Do you like brain teasers ?
 Oh , I love brain teasers .
 What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common ?
 They both suck .
 Neener neener .
