 00 : 00 : 02, 443 -- > 00 : 00 : 06, 496 Is anyone else troubled by the Spider- Man theme song ?
 Why would it trouble you ?
 It 's , like , your third favorite cartoon theme song .
 It is , right behind ♪ Do do- do do- do , Inspector Gadget ... ♪ ... and ♪ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ♪ ♪ Heroes in a half- shell
 WOLOWlTZ and KOOTHRAPPALl : ♪ Turtle power !
 However , the Spider- Man lyrics posit that " Spider- Man , Spider- Man does whatever a spider can . "
 Yeah , so ?
 I can think of many things Spider- Man can 't do that a spider can .
 One : crawl in your ear and die .
 Two : legally leave Guatemala without a passport .
 Three : have sex with a spider .
 Can we change the subject ?
 Spiders give me the jeebie- jeebies .
 It 's " heebie- jeebies . "
 I know , but that sounds anti- Semitic .
 Anyway , I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight .
 The theme : movies that killed their franchises . Oh .
 Like ( chuckles )

 I mean , you know a movie 's bad when my homegirl Sandy B. can 't save it .
 Penny 's working tonight ; I 'm in . Not me .
 I 'm having dinner with Bernadette and her parents . Fun .
 We know how much you love that .
 It 's torture .
 Especially with her dad .
 We have nothing in common .
 You know what I like to do when I 'm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station ?
 I bring up an interesting topic , like the difference between Spider- Man and spiders .
 Thanks , Sheldon .
 I 'll try that with my father- in- law .
 No , you can 't use that one . That 's mine .
 Uh , try this one for an ice- breaker .
 Uh , despite popular lore , there is no place in the continental United States , Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the center of the earth and come up in China .
 Great , thank you .
 Actually , you can 't have that one either . It 's too good . Sorry .
 What about you , Sheldon ? Do you have any plans tonight ?
 Sadly , yes . Amy 's taking me to a memorial service .
 It 's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent , so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave , he 'll never make his way back to China .
 That should lighten the mood .
 What can I say ?
 I put the " fun " in funeral . ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ... Wait ! ♪ ♪ The Earth began to cool ♪ The autotrophs began to drool , Neanderthals developed tools ♪ ♪ We built the Wall ♪ ♪ ♪ Math , Science , History , unraveling the mystery ♪ ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪ ♪ ♪
 Original Air Date on Decxember 6 , 2012 Amy .
 Amy .
 Oh , right , funeral .
 ( lower ) :
 Amy .

 Hello , Sheldon .
 I 'm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie , but you can wear a bathrobe ?
 I think I 'm too sick to go to the funeral . You 're sick ?
 You poor kid .
 Well , see ya . Sheldon , aren 't you gonna take care of me ?

 Me ? No .
 No , I 'm not that kind of doctor . But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick , the other must take care of them .
 Oh , I see the confusion .
 No , the intent behind that clause was to force to take care of when I 'm ill .
 When you 're feeling better , you 'll think that 's funny .

 Never mind .
 Good night , Sheldon .
 Amy . Amy .
 Amy .
 I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this .
 Additionally , you are my girlfriend , and I care about your well- being .
 Thank you , Sheldon .
 You 're welcome .
 Now let 's get this over with .
 ( sighs )
 So , how have you been ?
 Fine .
 Good . Fine is good .
 ( sighs )
 How you liking retirement ?
 It 's fine .

 I 'm sensing a theme .
 ( chuckles )
 You ever really think about the Spider- Man theme song ?
 How 's that dinner coming ?
 I just put it in . It 's gonna be a while .
 I like rare chicken .
 Let 's do this .
 You could die .
 Death by chicken .
 ( chuckles )
 That 's a pretty " fowl " way to go .
 Here 's another beer , honey .
 Thank you . So , Mrs. Rostenkowski , you took that trip to the Grand Canyon .
 How was it ?
 It was good .
 Had no idea you were the chatty one .
 ( thermometer beeps )
 102 . 2 . ( coughs )
 Exactly what it was half an hour ago .
 It 's like you 're not even trying to get better .
 Sheldon , you don 't get over the flu in half an hour .
 Well , not with that attitude . I have to say , I 'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking .

 I 'm sorry .
 I just want you to get better as soon as possible . And with that goal in mind , let me ask you a question .
 Do you believe in the placebo effect ?

 Of course I do .
 There have been many studies proving its validity . Great .
 Now , this may look like a Tic Tac ... ... but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath .
 Sheldon , this isn 't helping .
 Why don 't you just let me get some rest .
 How can you sleep ?
 I 'm not done making you feel better . I still have to put a cold rag on your head , sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest .
 Y- You want to rub something on my chest ?
 Yes .
 All over it .
 ( coughs )
 Maybe we should start with that .
 Now you 're being a responsible patient .
 Now , you may notice some tingling .
 Oh , I 'm counting on it .
 ( sighs ) :
 Oh .
 Okay , dig in .
 Hold up . Bless us , O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord .

 Amen .
 Took the words right out of my mouth .
 So , Dad , have you done any fishing lately ?
 I 'm going next weekend .
 Oh , you like to fish ? Yes .
 Sure .
 I can hear it in your voice .
 Oh , if he didn 't like it , he wouldn 't go . You know , I hadn 't thought of that .

 ( whispers ) :
 Help me . Hey , Dad , maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime .
 Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better .
 No , no .
 We know each other well enough .
 He 's been talking my ear off all night .
 Howie , I think you 'd have fun .
 Fine , you can tag along .
 Terrific .
 My two favorite fellas gone fishin ' .
 Well , hang on a second , Bernie .
 Next weekend , we have that thing .
 Whathing ?
 You know , the thing .
 Oh , that thing .
 No , I cancelled that thing .
 All right , it 's settled .
 You and I are going fishing .
 Great .
 ( quietly ) :
 Thanks for the help .
 I 've never even been fishing .
 This is gonna be a disaster . If you don 't want to look foolish doing something , you should practice .
 Do you know how many beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over ?
 I 'll give you a hint .
 You can see them here , here ... and here .
 Raj is probably right .
 You should get someone to give you some pointers .
 Do either of you guys know how to fish ?
 BOTH ( chuckle ) : No . But if you catch anything ,
 I know how to steam it in banana leaves . Come on , we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this .

 S 'up ?

 Step one : worms . Ew !
 Okay , right there , " ew " is one of the things you 're not gonna want to say in front of your father- in- law .
 It 's right up there with " icky " and " get it away . "
 Now pick one up .
 Really ?
 You 're gonna have to do it when you 're fishing .
 Okay .

 What are you waiting for ? I don 't know , for them to die of natural causes .
 Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook .
 Fine .
 ( clears throat )

 There .
 I 'm no expert , but I think the hook has to go through the worm .
 Fine .
 Sorry , Mr. Worm .
 Sherm .
 Sherm the Worm .
 Hey , don 't name him .
 Just jab a hook in his face .

 You got this , buddy .
 Yeah , come on , Howard .
 Hook that worm .
 You can do it .
 That 's great .
 Cheerleading -- way to man things up . " And the control group displayed
 " significantly fewer genetic abnormalities .
 " But , because of flaws in the experimental design
 " relating to environment and diet , they lived inconclusively ever after . "
 The end .
 That was great . Rub my chest again .
 ( knock at door ) No .
 I need to get you down for a nap .
 For some reason , that VapoRub gets you all fired up .

 How 's the poor thing ? Oh , I 'm hanging in there . Thanks for asking .
 Okay , Amy , I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab .
 This is proving really good for congestion , but there 's a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid , so if you take it -- happy thoughts .

 Uh , I 'm going to draw you a soothing bath .
 Where 's your bath thermometer ? I don 't have a bath thermometer .
 Fine .
 Then I 'm going to draw you a nerve- wracking bath of indeterminate temperature .
 This is a really good expectorant .
 Although some test subjects reported
 lactating uncontrollably when they heard music .
 ( quietly ) :
 Okay , okay , here 's the deal . I don 't need your medicine .
 I 'm not sick . I don 't understand .
 I got better two days ago .
 It 's just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me .
 So you 've just been lying to him ?
 See the stuff in my nose ? Rubber cement .
 I don 't mean to be judgy , but this is the kind of thing lunatics do .
 All right . I 'll tell him .
 Amy , would you be strong enough to bathe yourself , or do you need my help ?
 SHELDON :
 I 'll tell him tomorrow .
 Mama needs a bath .
 Now , let 's assume , by some miracle , you actually catch a fish .
 You 're going to have to know how to gut it .
 So , what you 're going to do is you 're going to take your knife , slice him right up the belly .
 ( gagging )
 You want me to stop ?
 No , I 'm fine . Keep going .
 All right .
 Now , you don 't want to cut too deep into its guts , or the blood will just squirt all over your face . ( gagging )
 Oh , my God .
 What is with you guys ?
 It 's not our fault .
 Our dads never did anything like this with us . What , never ? My dad was an anthropologist .
 The only father- son time he spent was with a 2, 000- year- old skeleton of an Etruscan boy .
 I hated that kid . Mine just took me to his gynecology office .
 I got so bored , I 'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice- skating .
 Yeah , well , my quality father- son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday .
 Yeah , okay , Howard wins .
 You know , maybe we didn 't have opportunities like this when we were growing up , but right now , there 's a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip .
 You 're right .
 I should do this . PENNY : Great .
 ( clears throat )
 Here you go .
 What you 're going to do is you 're going to stick your thumb down its throat , grab the guts and pull .
 Here we go .
 ( grunting )
 Oh , look , it 's a female .
 You can see all the eggs .
 ( gagging )
 ( singing along to stereo ) : ♪ I 'm walking on sunshine ♪ ♪ Whoa , oh ♪ And don 't it feel good ? ♪ ♪ Oh , yeah ♪ And don 't it feel good ? ♪ ( shuts off stereo )
 Oh , Sheldon , am I glad you 're back .
 Taking a turn for the worst .
 I think I 'm going to need another bath .
 I 'm surprised to hear that . See , the other day , I was concerned that you weren 't recovering , so while you were sleeping ,
 I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab .
 Oh ?
 I got the results back . Have you developed any of the following symptoms ?
 A growing nose , or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region ?
 Also known as full- blown " liar , liar , pants on fire . "
 All right , all right .
 But I really was sick at the beginning .
 It 's just been so nice having you take care of me .
 It hurts that you would lie to me , Amy .
 I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favor .
 I feel terrible I did this .
 It pains me to say it , but I think some form of penalty is in order , so as to discourage this type of behavior in the future .
 I suppose that 's fair .
 What do you suggest ?
 In a perfect world , I 'd lock you in a stockade in the public square .
 That probably requires a permit .
 I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next movie .
 Oh , that seems overly harsh .
 You gave in to a hun weakness . You didn 't kill a man .
 You know , it 's a tad old- school , but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey .
 Are you saying you want to spank me ?
 I don 't want to .
 But it looks like you left me no choice .
 That 's true .
 I 've been a very bad girl .
 Hi- ho , hi- ho , it 's off to fish we go .
 That 's what you 're wearing ?
 No good ?
 The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear . Maybe in cartoons .
 Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook .
 All right , let 's hit the road .
 I wouldn 't mind shooting some ducks in the morning .
 Wait , now we 're shooting things ? I like using a big shell .
 You can 't eat them afterwards , but it 's fun watching them blow up .
 Sir , I 'm flattered that you invited me , and I really want you to like me , but ...
 I don 't think this trip is the way to do it .
 And I can 't return these things if there 's chunks of duck all over them .
 So , why 'd you agree to come ?
 ' Cause Bernadette made me .
 I tried to back out , too .
 My wife said I had to go .
 Really ? Your wife makes you do stuff ? You 're a big , scary cop .
 You 're an astronaut , and your wife makes you do things , and she 's only four feet tall .
 So , what do we do now ?
 They expect us to go away for the weekend .
 Ah ... ( sighs )
 There 's an Indian casino near Palm Springs .
 You know how to shoot craps ?
 No , but I 'm not a stranger to dice games .
 I was the Temple Beth- El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion .
 Mazel tov .
 I 'll teach you how to play .
 Really ?
 Thank you , sir .
 Call me Mike .
 Okay . Oh , boy , we 're just married to a couple of ballbusters , huh , Mike ? ( laughing ) :

 That 's my wife and daughter you 're talking about .
 Great couple of gals .
 I wouldn 't go that far .

 Are you prepared to receive your punishment ?

 One second .
 I want to put on some music .
 Why ?
 I don 't want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me .
 ( R & B playing )
 Very well , then .
 Get over my knee . Let 's begin .


 Oh , my .
 Excuse me .
 You 're not supposed to be enjoying this .
 Then maybe you should spank me harder .
 Maybe I will .
 Ooh !
