 Hey , I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps ... ... into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking .
 We had that idea years ago .
 How come we never did anything with it ?
 Because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant and none of us wanted to walk back .
 I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea .
 You thought of it September 22nd , 2007 .
 Two days later , Penny moved in ... ... and so much blood rushed to your genitals your brain became a ghost town .
 That 's not what happened .
 I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating ...
 - ... the anniversary of Dr. Seuss ' death .
 - No one wants to hear it . Why , die ?
 Why did he die ?
 Old , told I was told he was old
 Penny is not the reason I didn 't pursue that idea .
 Oh , really ?
 Since meeting her , what have been your greatest accomplishments ?
 Easy . Sleeping with Penny .
 Getting Penny to go out with him after she dumped him .
 Tricking Penny into getting engaged .
 And a few weeks ago , he almost did a pull- up .
 I think someone owes me an apology .
 Well , don 't feel bad .
 I think we 've all been distracted since the girls entered our lives .
 - You admit Amy 's a distraction ?
 - Oh , very much so .
 Listen to this . This is from two days ago .
 " Hi . Hope you 're having a good day . "
 Who has time for this constant sexting ?
 Maybe we have lost our focus .
 It wouldn 't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas .
 Ooh . We could have one of those retreats .
 Like our own science retreat .
 - My cousin has a cabin out in the woods .
 - I 'm not going to a cabin in the woods .
 Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods ?
 - Then we 'll go to a hotel . - A hotel ? Did you see The Shining ?


 We could go up to Big Bear , get a house on the lake .
 Did you see The Lake House ?

 Nothing bad happens in The Lake House .
 Well , no , not to them . To me .
 Time- traveling mailbox .
 The only time that traveled was an hour and a half of my life down the toilet .
 - Fine .
 We 'll stay here and do it . - You didn 't suggest a beach house .
 - You would go to a beach house ?
 - Well , good Lord , no .
 Have you seen Jaws ?











 - Hey .
 - Hey .
 So the guys and I are talking about having a science retreat this weekend .
 I wanted to know if that 's okay . You and I talked about going to brunch .
 - Wanna go to Vegas this weekend ?
 - Of course I do .
 - Bernadette , girl 's weekend , Vegas .
 You in ? - Yeah .
 - Yes . I 'll check flights .
 - I 'll check hotels .
 I 'll check my underpants .
 I 'm so excited I think I peed .

 They seem okay with it .

 - Hey .
 - Hey .
 - I didn 't think you 'd make it . - Why not ?
 You have a steady girlfriend now .
 We assumed you 'd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit .

 For your information , Emily is working tonight .
 One would assume on getting out of the pit .
 Okay , let 's focus .
 The girls are gone , we have 48 hours , there are no distractions .
 - Let 's change the world . - Thinking caps on .
 - Here we go . - Ooh . This is exciting .
 We 're innovating . I feel like we 're in the Facebook movie .
 - Oh .
 I never saw that . - Really ?
 It 's wonderful .
 And I swear I 'm not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it .

 Yeah , I have it on Blu- ray .
 We should watch it .
 Cool .
 I 'll make the popcorn .
 Guys , in 30 seconds we went from " Let 's change the world " to " Let 's watch TV . "

 I 'm sorry , is that a no ?
 Leonard 's right . We 're here to focus .
 Didn 't we used to have a list of all our ideas ?
 I think I still have it .
 I did not get a clear answer .
 I 'm gonna set this down now .
 Ah .
 Here it is . Heh .
 Whoa .
 I haven 't looked at these in years .
 - " Robot girlfriend . "
 - Mmm .
 That was mine .
 " Robot prostitute . "
 Also mine . I 'm confused .
 Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute ?
 There 's just some things you don 't do with your robot girlfriend .

 Boy , when you met Bernadette , the field of robotics really took a hit .
 Okay , let 's just skip all the inventions you can have sex with .

 Here we go .
 - " Ergonomic heated seat cushion . " - It vibrates .
 Keep going .

 Know what ?
 Let 's just come up with something new .
 You know , a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction .
 The geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke .
 The Motorola flip phone , that came from Star Trek .
 And I have long suspected that the idea of an African- American president ... ... was stolen from the movie Deep Impact .

 Hey , the future they show in Back to the Future Il ... ... is only a year away .
 A lot of things in that movie haven 't been invented yet .
 How cool would it be if we could make one of those ?
 If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty 's hoverboard ... ... that would have universal application .
 It 's possible at absolute zero , but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions .
 - Oh , I have an idea .
 - I think I have the same one .
 We gottawatch Back to the Future Il .

 I 'll make the popcorn .
 - So where should we go first ?
 - Ooh .
 - There 's a cover band in the lounge .
 - Nah . - But they play Barry Manilow .
 - No .
 But they 're called Fairly Manilow .
 - Oh , okay . - Great .
 No .
 - Well , what do you wanna do ?
 - Well , we 're in Vegas .
 I wanna go downstairs , get a bucket of margaritas ... ... dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere .
 - What if we don 't wanna vomit ?
 - Oh , you will .
 That 's why they give you the bucket .
 - Uh- oh . It 's my boss .
 - What ?
 - They moved my field ride up to Monday .
 - What does that mean ?
 It means instead of having a week to study , I only have two days .
 - That sucks . - Can you start in the morning ?

 It 's kind of a lot .
 Let me do a little tonight and I 'll catch up with you later .
 - You sure ? - Yeah , it 's okay .
 Go ahead .
 - So , uh , now that Penny 's not coming ...
 Okay .
 - We 're not seeing Fairly Manilow .

 Okay , wait .
 Hold on .
 Pause .
 Something doesn 't make sense . Look .
 In 2015 , Biff steals the sports almanac ... ... and takes the time machine back to 1955 to give it to his younger self .
 But as soon as he does that , he changes the future ... ... so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015 ... ... not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in .
 This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again .

 If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac ... ... he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it .
 Because it wasn 't until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet .
 - Whoa . Is " placed " right ?
 - What do you mean ?
 Is " placed " the right tense for something that would have happened ... ... in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future ?

 " Had will have placed " ?
 That 's my boy .
 Okay , so it wasn 't until his 21 st birthday ... ... that Biff " had will have placed " his first bet and made his millions .
 That 's when he altered the timeline .
 Yeah , but he had will haven 't placed it .
 What ?
 Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine , this couldn 't be more simple .
 When Biff gets the almanac in 1955 , the alternate future he creates ... ... isn 't the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015 .

 Therefore , in the new timeline , Marty and Doc never brought the time ma ...
 Wait , is " brought " right ?


 Marty and Doc never " had have had brought " ? I don 't know , you did it to me .
 Yeah . I 'm going with it .
 Marty and Doc never " had have had " brought the time machine to 2015 .
 That means 2015 Biff ... ... could also not " had have had " brought the almanac to 1955 Biff .
 Therefore , the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac ... ... is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac .
 And not just never gets .
 Never have , never hasn 't , never had have hasn 't .

 He 's right .
 Also , what kind of name is Biff ?
 Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough .
 Biff .
 Oh , ho .
 That stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies .
 - Guys . - Do you know that the word " wiener " ... ... comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna , or " Wien " ?


 Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener ?
 Guys , what are we doing ?
 We sent the girls away so we could focus .
 I don 't think it worked .

 Maybe after this , you 'll be in the mood for some Manilow .
 I think after this , I 'll be dead .
 Look at us . Out while Penny 's in the room studying .
 I 'm proud of her . This is a great opportunity . It 's nice to see her take it seriously .
 It is .
 But enough about Penny , let 's talk about us .
 We 're looking good .
 - We are .
 Heh .
 - Better than good .
 I mean , look at you .
 Your body 's banging .
 - Amy . - Don 't " Amy " me .
 We 're always talking about how hot Penny is .
 Come on , scientist to scientist ... ... how big are those Hadron Colliders ?

 - You 're embarrassing me .
 - Oh , don 't be embarrassed . I 'll show you the divot in my spine .
 - What ?
 - No , no , it 's okay , I was born with it .
 If you put a double- A battery in there , it makes my leg kick .

 All right . Oh , this is already better .
 There are far fewer distractions in here .
 Plus this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work .
 So I 've been thinking about the hoverboards , and maybe we could use maglev technology .
 Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials , we could utilize quantum coupling .
 Oh , I wonder if anyone 's tried that . Go online and look it up .
 I can 't argue with him .
 It 's right there on the screen .
 Austria does look like a wiener .
 Heh .
 That 's nothing , dude .
 Go check out how hung Florida is .
 I 'm sure Mrs. Florida 's walking funny .
 Can we get back to work ?
 He 's right .
 Oh , here 's a thought .
 What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques ... ... to keep us from getting off topic ?
 - Like behavior modification ?
 - Exactly .
 Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play Ping- Pong ?
 That cannot be true .




 Hey , it was match point .
 Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment . Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic .
 Not getting to see who wins at pigeon Ping- Pong comes to mind .

 We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked .
 Not bad .
 You know , in medieval times ... ... idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold 's bridle .
 It 's an iron cage that 's locked around the head and pierces the tongue .
 If only we had one .
 Oh , I 'll check Amazon .

 Housekeeping .
 We got a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there .
 It was us the whole time .
 - Why 'd you tell her ?
 It was working .
 - Was it working ?
 Yeah .
 Oh .
 I 'm so sorry .
 You guys look like you 're having fun .
 We 're having the best time .
 Guess who won $100 playing craps .
 That 's a dollar .
 Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress . Hey , Penny , let 's go .
 We found a place that has Australian male strippers .
 We wanna see if they twirl their junk in the other direction .



 That sounds so great , but I have a little more studying to do .
 Ugh .
 Can you believe this nerd ?
 Do you wanna sit here being a loser ... ... or do you wanna watch me climb into an Australian man 's G- string ... ... like a baby kangaroo ?



 All right . Guys , look .
 I would love to go out , but I 've gotta get this done .
 Okay ?
 So have fun at the club .
 And if you get in trouble , find a policeman .
 And if he 's taking off his pants , he is not a real policeman .
 Okay , okay .
 This is obviously very important to her .
 Let 's just ...
 We 'll help her study so she can get done quicker . Here .
 Here , I 'm gonna quiz you . I 'm gonna quiz you .
 I got your notes .
 I got your notes . I got your notes .
 If you want these , they 're gonna be at the strip club .

 - Aren 't you gonna chase her ?
 - To the walk- in closet ? Sure .


 Okay , so we agree .
 Whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off .
 I can 't let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I 've been cheating on her .
 All right , now , one benefit of quantum coupling ...
 Question .
 Who decides if someone 's gone off topic ?
 I think it 'll be pretty clear . If not , we 'll take a vote . Oh , and also ...
 Ow !

 - We didn 't vote . - We didn 't have to .
 That was clearly a tangent . Now , come on .
 Back to work . If we 're leaning towards quantum coupling ...
 Ow ! Why ?
 You said quantum coupling .
 That made me think of the show Quantum Leap .
 That 's a tangent and it 's your fault .
 That 's ridiculous . I vote that is not a tangent .
 Yeah , thank you . And now I owe you one .

 Ow ! That was your fault .
 Hey !
 Oh , hoo- hoo . That is a lot of hair .
 Ow !
 And now I 'm gonna hear it from Jenny .
 Everyone , stop .
 This was a stupid idea .
 Negative reinforcement isn 't working . I think you mean " positive punishment . "
 Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus .
 It 's a common mistake .
 " Negative reinforcement " is really wrong ?
 It 's used incorrectly all the time . Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters .

 No way .
 Not Bill Murray .
 I 'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability .
 Huh . Bill Murray did get it wrong .
 - Jump to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man .
 - No .
 Leonard 's right . We can 't just jump ahead .
 We have to watch the whole movie .
 We keep procrastinating .
 We saw Back to the Future Il , pigeons playing Ping- Pong ... ... countries that looked like genitals ... ... and one guy whose genitals looked like Denmark .
 Yeah , sorry for clicking on that .
 It 's late .
 We 've wasted hours .
 Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight ?
 But we didn 't see them bust one ghost .
 So you 're saying we should stand here , in my lab , on a Saturday night ... ... and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop ?
 No . MAN When there 's something strange
 In the neighborhood
 Who you gonna call ?
 ALL Ghostbusters
 When there 's something weird ...
 It really does hold up .


 See ?
 Isn 't this better than a hotel room ?
 Yep .
 Shake that thing .
 Have you ever seen a body so fine ?
 We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class ... ... but none of them moved like that .



 Good morning .
 You wanna go to the pool ?
 Come on .
 You said it yourself .
 Only nerds and losers stay in the room .

 Wow , it 's bright out .
 Isn 't it bright ? I should probably close these curtains .
 Nah . Bye . Would you please close the drapes ?
 Okay .
