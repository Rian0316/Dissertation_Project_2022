 00 : 00 : 03, 641 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 988 What are you drawing over there ?
 A hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee- sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe .
 Oh , you silly doodlebug .
 You know , a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life- forms would probably not end well for us .
 It 's a Frisbee- sized wormhole , Leonard .
 You can block it with a Frisbee . Calm down .

 Do you expect me to build this ?
 I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin . Gentlemen .

 Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at 2 : 45 ? Really ?
 He probably just goes to the bathroom .
 Actually , no , he goes to the bathroom at 8 : 00 a . m . with optional follow- ups at 1 : 45 and 7 : 10 on high- fiber Fridays .
 It 's sad that you know that .
 Oh , that 's just the tip of the sadness iceberg .
 I 'm looking at his public calendar .
 2 : 45 to 3 : 05 , nothing .
 Yesterday , 2 : 45 to 3 : 05 , nothing . Last week , nothing .
 Last month , nothing .
 He never has anything booked during that time .
 20 minutes a day , completely unaccounted for .
 We should figure out where he goes .
 Ooh , this is exciting .
 Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties .
 Right , the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life ?
 Colonel Koothrapali in ten with the olive spread .

 Original Air Date on November 15 , 2012
 So , how was work today ? Well , I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection .
 That sounds like fun .
 Yeah , it was .
 Oh , good , I guessed right .
 ( phone chimes )
 Who you talking to ?
 Oh , just this guy I met at school .
 Oh , great .
 We 're still dating , right ? Relax .
 He 's just a friend .
 We 're doing an oral report together .
 He 's really nice .
 I 'm sorry , what was that ? I had a little stroke after " oral . "
 Would you stop ?
 ( phone chimes )
 Look , he just moved here from London , okay ?
 He doesn 't really know anybody . Oh , good , an English accent , the sexiest accent you can have .
 No .
 That 's not true .
 There 's French , there 's Italian .
 No , you 're right , it 's the best .
 Did you tell him you have a boyfriend ?
 It didn 't come up .
 Well , maybe you should tell him .
 What am I supposed to say ?
 Say , " Can 't talk right now . " Hanging with my boyfriend .
 England sucks , you suck , USA number one . "

 Fine . " Hanging with my boyfriend .
 Talk to you later . " Happy ?
 Yes .
 Thank you .
 Mm- hmm .
 ( phone chimes ) ( suppressed giggle )

 What did he say ?
 Nothing .
 What ?
 " Did your boyfriend make you type that ? "
 I hate this guy .
 Don 't be like that .
 Come on , trust me , he 's hitting on you .
 No , he 's not .
 We 're just friends . Look , is this gonna be a problem ?
 Because he 's supposed to come over tomorrow to work .
 Really ? Here ? ( sighs )
 If it makes you uncomfortable , I 'll switch partners , even though the thing 's due next week and everyone already has a partner and I 'll probably end up failing the class .
 That 'd be great .
 Thank you .
 2 : 44 , right on schedule .
 Hey , Sheldon .
 Oh , hello . Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow- in- the- dark bunny .

 Want to come with us ?
 No , thank you . Are you sure ?
 They turn off the lights , and it 's like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place . I 'm quite sure .
 Good day .
 Well , where are you going ?
 Where are you going ?
 We just told you .
 I just told you . No , you didn 't .
 Well , it 's your word against mine ; see you in court .
 Should we follow him ?
 I don 't know , I 'm torn .
 I want to know where he 's going , but now I kind of want to play with the bunny .
 Hi , guys .
 Hey , Alex , do you know where your boss just went ?
 No . Don 't you know his schedule ? All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find " quieter pants . "

 Come on .
 Boy , what I wouldn 't give to get her out of those pants ... and into something a little more stylish .
 ( door closes )
 This is where he goes ?
 What 's in there ?
 I think it 's an old storage room . What could he be doing in there every day for 20 minutes ?
 Well , he 's not doing 20- minute abs , because if he were , he would have way better abs .
 ( quietly ) :
 Can you hear anything ?
 Not yet .
 ( whispering ) :
 What are you doing ?
 I 'm listening .
 Can 't you face the other way and listen ?
 I can 't do anything right for you , can I ? What the hell is he up to ?
 He is kind of a weirdo .
 Maybe he 's got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there .
 Or Bill Gates .
 Or Stephen Hawking .
 Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking ?
 Howard , please , you can 't treat the man differently just because he 's disabled .
 That 's not okay .
 If you 're wondering why
 I 've been staring through the peephole ,
 I 'm trying to get a look at this guy who 's coming over to Penny 's .
 To be honest , I didn 't know you were here .
 It 's not a big deal . He 's just in her history class .
 They 're working on a project together .
 I don 't even know why I care .
 You know what , I don 't care . You think don 't care .
 This is silly .
 I have nothing to worry about .
 Oh , I don 't know . Statistically speaking ,
 I 'm sure you have something to worry about .
 What do you mean ?
 Well , if we assume your looks are average , right off the bat , 50 % of men on Earth are more attractive than you .
 That 's 1 . 5 billion handsome lads standing by , waiting to rain on your parade .
 Well , yeah , but this isn 't just about looks .
 I 'm way above average in a lot of other things .
 Not height , vision , athleticism , or ability to digest dairy products .
 I 'm talking about important things
 like emotional maturity .
 You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole . I liked it better when you thought I wasn 't here .
 I 'm not saying you don 't have attractive qualities .
 Your choice of friends is impeccable , you 're a good sleeper .
 And last but not least , you buy the grapes I like .
 You 're a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes .
 None of this matters . I trust that Penny cares about me , and nothing 's gonna happen with this guy .
 Well , unless of course he 's a skilled hypnotist .
 What ? While unlikely , it 's still a statistical possibility .
 She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it .
 Now you 're just being ridiculous .
 Am I ? The mind 's a mysterious thing , Leonard .
 He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she 's a chicken pecking for corn .
 Look at us , sneaking around in the middle of the night
 like a couple of cat burglars .
 I think we 're more like ninjas .
 I don 't want to be a ninja ; I want to be a cat burglar . Fine , I 'll be a ninja , you be a cat burglar .
 No , we both have to be the same thing .
 Okay , we 're ninjas .
 Thank you . But next time , we 'll be cat burglars .

 It 's locked .
 Are you sure ?
 Yes , I 'm sure . Now , you stand guard , I 'm going to ...
 It 's locked .
 Just keep an eye out .
 I 'll have this open in a minute .
 When did you learn how to pick locks ? When I was starting to do magic in junior high ,
 I thought I could be an escape artist
 like Harry Houdini .
 How did that work out ? Pretty good .
 I managed to escape friends , popularity , and every party thrown in a 12- mile radius .
 There . Ready ?
 Hold on , hold on . What ? Sheldon is a very smart man , and he obviously wants to keep this a secret .

 Yeah , so ? What if it 's booby- trapped ?
 Don 't worry , I 'm one step ahead of him .
 Great , what 's your pl ...
 Are we good ?
 ( sadly ) :
 Yeah .
 Huh .
 Forty- three . What the hell does that mean ?
 I don 't know .
 The solution to an equation ?
 Maybe . It 's a prime number .
 Encryption systems are built on prime numbers .
 What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt ?
 He 's always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty .
 It 's paprika .
 Really ?
 Well , okay , one mystery solved .
 MAN ( with English accent ) :
 Okay , good night . PENNY :
 Thanks , Cole .
 See you at school .
 COLE :
 See you .
 ( door closes )
 I 'll be right back .
 I thought you left a long time ago .

 What 's up ?
 Hey . You moving into the apartment on the fifth floor ?
 No , I was just visiting a friend .
 Oh , cool .
 That cute blonde on four ?
 Yeah . You know her ?
 I , well , I see her around . I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude .
 Really ?
 Yeah .
 He 's ganged up .
 She told me he 's a scientist .
 That 's the name of his gang .
 The Scientists .
 They are crazy .
 Well , thanks for the tip .
 No problem , brother .
 Stay frosty .
 We 're still dating , right ?


 Oh , hello , Dr. Hofstadter .
 Hey , Alex , and call me Leonard .
 Dr. Hofstadter is my father .
 And my mother .
 And my sister . And our cat .
 Although , I 'm pretty sure
 Dr. Boots Hofstadter 's degree was honorary .
 May I join you , Leonard ? Sure .
 Thanks . Hey , Alex , let me ask you something .
 My girlfriend knows this guy at school .
 He 's got an English accent .
 Ooh , I love English accents . Yeah , you all do .
 Anyway , I feel like he 's hitting on her .
 She says he 's just being nice and that I should trust her .
 It 's probably harmless .
 You know how it is . I 'm sure you get hit on all the time .
 Right . Because girls are always like ,
 " Ooh , that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms
 " and gets a lot of ear infections .
 I got to get me some of that . "
 I don 't know ,
 I bet it happens more than you realize .
 Trust me , it doesn 't . You sure ?
 You 're cute , you 're funny .
 Maybe you 're getting hit on , and you don 't even know it .
 Really ?
 I 'm pretty sure .
 ( laughing )
 Okay , I got to get back to work .
 Thanks for listening .
 No problem .
 Hope- hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way . ( laughing )
 Come on , we 're smart guys .
 We can figure this out . Forty- three .
 What is 43 ?
 Besides my mom 's neck size .
 It 's the atomic number for technetium .
 That stuff 's radioactive . Do you think he 's building a bomb ?
 It took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star ; I 'm not worried .
 Ooh , this could be something .
 43 is the number of calories in half a cup of fat- free yogurt .
 Why would you know that ?
 I 'm sorry .
 We can 't all eat whatever we want and still stay thin .
 Wait , in the isn 't 43 the answer to the question of life , the universe , and everything ?
 That 's 42 , dumb- ass .
 Hey , hey .
 Feelings .
 We should stop .
 I 'm exhausted .
 Yeah , me , too .
 We 've got more important things to do .
 Who cares what stupid 43 means ?
 Not me . Let 's go home .

 You want to get something to eat ?
 Sounds good .

 What the balls is 43 ? !
 I have to know !
 Hi .
 Hey , shouldn 't you be out with your gang , spray painting equations on the side of buildings ?
 Come on , I 'm sorry .
 I just can 't believe you don 't trust me . I do , of course I do .
 Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend , who , by the way , knew exactly who you were ?
 Really ?
 Your picture 's on my refrigerator .
 Oh .
 You know , I 'm really starting to not like this guy . What is your problem ?
 Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home ?
 I don 't know . It 's hard sometimes .
 Everywhere you go , guys hit on you , even if I 'm standing right there .
 And they 're all taller than me . Why is everyone taller than me ?
 You know what , this is all in my head .
 It 's my problem , not yours . Leonard , why do you always do this ? Listen to me , you 're the one I 'm with .
 You know I love you , so will you please relax because you 're driving me crazy .

 You know that 's the first time you ever said that you love me .
 Yeah .
 We 're just supposed to pretend it 's not a big deal ?
 That 's ... exactly what we 're gonna do because ... you 're about to make me cry , and we both know if I start crying , you 're gonna start crying .


 ( sniffling ) You 're right , you should go .
 ( crying ) :
 All right .

 She loves me .
 ( phone chimes )
 " Hey , it 's Alex .
 " Nice having coffee with you . " If you want to talk more , I 'm always available .
 Smiley face , smiley face . "
 What a friendly girl .


 Okay , picture 's up .
 Looks like the camera 's working .
 That 's good quality video . It better be .
 It 's the spare camera for the Mars rover .
 How did you get your hands on that ?
 Million dollar camera -- ten dollar lock .
 KOOTHRAPPALl :
 Oh , my God , here he comes .
 This is it .



 What the hell is that thing ?
 I don 't know . This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper . Experimental log .
 Wormhole generator test 44 .
 Wormhole generator test ? The first 43 parallel universes
 I 've checked proved to be empty .
 I see no reason to suspect universe number 44 will be any different .

 Oh , my God !
 Holy crap !
 ( screaming )

 Oh !
 It 's eating my face !
 Aah !
 It 's eating his face !
 ( screaming )
 I found your Webcam and replaced the video feed .
 You two should be ashamed of yourselves .
 Sheldon , we 're really sorry . Yeah , really sorry . Sorry ?
 You may not realize it , but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life .
 You know , understanding sarcasm , feigning interest in others , not talking about trains as much as I want to .
 It 's exhausting . Which is why , for 20 minutes a day ,
 I like to go down to that room , turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge .
 But what are you doing in there ? And what does 43 mean ?
 You don 't need to know , you don 't deserve to know , and you will never know .
 ( sighs )

 One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight ...
 Drat .
 I 'm never going to get to 43 again .
 One , two , three , four ...
 Rats .
