 00 : 00 : 03, 580 -- > 00 : 00 : 05, 780 Okay , everybody , gather 'round .
 Who knew it was " Bring your girlfriend to work " day ?
 She is not my girlfriend .
 Judy is a CPR doll , and the hardest- working girl in this diner .
 Oh , Han , you shouldn 't bring your sex doll out in public .
 This is not my girlfriend or a sex doll !
 Earl , come over .
 We 're going to use Judy to learn how to resuscitate .
 I have a " Do not resuscitate " clause , as in , I do not resuscitate others .
 Oleg .
 What 's up , Han ?
 Oh , hey , Judy .
 How do you know Judy ?
 With a torso like that , she gets around .
 Okay , I will demonstrate .
 Oh , no !
 Judy 's choking on something !
 Well , we know it 's not you .
 First you have to tilt the head back and clear the airway and blow .
 Oh , Max , I think we 're witnessing his first kiss .
 Fourth , thank you very much .
 Han , why are you wasting your time kissing her ?
 She doesn 't have any arms .
 Just go for it .



 What 's up , everybody ?
 Big day today .
 Not as big as Christmas , but still marks the arrival of someone very blessed : me .
 Yeah , we get it .
 You talk about your birthday more than
 Kanye West talks about Kanye West .
 Caroline , I thought you would be crying .
 Tears on your birthday have become as expected as an ex- Disney star going to rehab .
 Why would I be sad ?
 I have my health , a business that 's budding --
 Boobs that aren 't .
 I don 't believe in birthdays .
 You 're only as old as you feel .
 Which makes me nothing years old .
 Speaking of nothing ...
 Caroline , are we still on for Two Boots pizza tonight ?
 I 'm closing the diner early in honor of your birthday , and just not because the city has demanded to
 look into the black mold situation .
 Absolutely , Han .
 You can have one slice with two toppings or two slices with one topping , and my birthday cake is a free flan
 ' cause I flirted with the dishwasher .
 Caroline , sweetheart , if I was you ,
 I would just put my head through a plate glass window .
 Okay , everybody .
 I have two announcements , both good news .
 First , the guy who found the beak in his sandwich is not suing , and second , I 'm gonna pop the question to Sophie .
 Well , you 've already popped everything else .
 What do you think ?
 They say diamonds are a girl 's best friend .
 Oh , really ?
 I thought a girl 's best friend was someone just a little fatter than her .
 It was my grandma 's from Russia .
 I had my cousin Svela swallow it to bring it to America .
 She passed customs , then she passed this .
 Five , six rinses later , boom !
 Duty free .
 Well , I guess that 's better than getting it at Kay .
 Is Sophie expecting it ?
 Of course .
 She doesn 't like surprises since her family barn was torched by a mentally unstable farmhand .
 Hi , I have a delivery for Caroline Channing from Martin Channing .
 Oh , it 's a birthday gift from my daddy all the way from prison .
 Last year , he made me a macaroni art picture frame .
 I mean , the man once rented Miami for a friend 's bachelor party .
 Hey , that picture frame fed us for two days .
 Yeah , well , this thing is not pasta , and it 's too big to fit through the door .
 And so was I three months ago .
 No , really .
 My seat on an airplane used to be Row Three .
 There it is in the street .
 A condom full of hamburger meat ?
 Oh , my God .
 Is that a Lamborghini ?
 Wait .
 Is that my Lamborghini ?
 Yeah , it 's a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster .
 Prison arts and crafts has gotten pretty fancy .
 Well , it takes four years for these cars to be custom- made .
 This one was ordered in 2011 .
 That 's right , my father ordered this for me when he still had money .
 Correction :
 When he had everyone else 's money .
 All my father ever gave me was that one iffy chromosome .
 Well , here you go .
 It 's all yours . I 'm gonna walk home .
 It 's all about healthy choices .
 I got a car !
 We got a car !
 Damn , someone painted the Batmobile white .
 Can 't we have anything ?
 That 's a $450, 000 sports car .
 I know .
 Add a stackable washer/ dryer and a motor home , and it 's like Caroline won the Showcase Showdown .
 It goes from 0 to 100 in 2 . 9 seconds .
 And speaking of seconds ,
 I 'm getting seconds at Two Boots , and that rich bitch is paying .
 Back off , Tokyo Drift .
 This is our getaway car .
 And by that , I mean get away from it .
 You know , a car like this depreciates 50 % the minute you drive it off the lot .
 That 's why I drive my Toyota Yaris .

 Is P. Diddy here ?
 Wait a minute .
 Is it Ted Turner ?
 No one cool owns it .
 It 's Caroline 's .
 Now , this is the kind of car that I would say yes to anything in .
 Anything except tickets to Menopause The Musical .
 Oh , hey , Caroline .
 Nice car .
 I always liked you more than Max .
 You know that , right , girl ?
 Really ?
 ' Cause yesterday , I heard you yell to Max ,
 " Is Caroline turning 47 or 48 ?
 ' Cause she acts like she 's 65 . "
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I wanted to know what to write in your birthday card .
 Well , everyone away from the car .
 I just got off the phone with my dad .
 The car is being seized in the morning .
 Turns out they won 't let me keep my present .
 It 's just like my eighth birthday when they made me return Macaulay Culkin .
 They bought you a boy ?
 You were rich .
 Oh , boy , the car 's right here , and you can 't even use it .
 That 's like me having you two for waitresses .
 Caroline , can I ask you a favor ?
 You 're not using the car to propose to Sophie .
 You heard how much she liked it .
 And it 's a little bit classier than my original plan : dinner and a cock fight in Yonkers .
 Not that I 'm listening , but I 'm not gonna get proposed to at a gay bar .
 Great , now my gay bar idea is out also .
 No , Oleg .
 I can 't return the car with scratches , dents , or chlamydia .
 But we can still drive it , right ?
 I mean , I 've been on that cream for like a month .
 Max , what is the ninth rule of the Lamborghini Club ?
 No red drinks in the car .
 Here 's my number one rule :
 If you 're going to make me sleep in it ,
 I am going to drink in it .
 Well , just be careful .
 I only have one Clorox wipe that has to last till my next birthday , and it 's already lost a lot of its moisture .
 I don 't see why we have to just sit here .
 We can 't drive it .
 My dad said if anything happens to it , we 'll be responsible .
 What could possibly happen on a weed run to deep Tijuana ?
 You know , I wish this car never came , and I wish I never sat in it .
 It 's the same reason I don 't go to Barneys .
 I don 't like to be around things I can 't afford anymore .
 Same reason I don 't go to the 99 Cent Store .
 There 's a Nerf tennis set half on the floor , half in the bin , none of it going home with me .
 I was trying to be positive about my birthday this year , but , Max , if things hadn 't happened with my father , tonight would have been a magical birthday for me .
 Hey , there was some magic .
 I personally made five vodka Sprites disappear .
 Ta- da !
 I would 've got in the car and driven out to the Hamptons , and we 'd sit on the beach all night having lobster caught by one of the townies and drink champagne while taking duckface selfies till the sun came up .


 FYl , I 'm the townie in this scenario , and I hate all of you .
 Instead of doing any of that , I 'm having the worst birthday .
 I probably feel worse than Demi Moore did when she turned 50 .
 Yes , just go to sleep .
 You 'll feel better tomorrow when you wake up .
 I mean , if that guy with the switchblade doesn 't come back like he promised he would .
 Caroline .
 Caroline , wake up .
 We 're at the beach .
 I drove us out to the Hamptons .
 Happy birthday !
 We 're in the Hamptons ?
 We 're in the Hamptons ?
 How are we in the Hamptons ?
 How long have I been sleeping ?
 Three hours , give or take .
 You farted twice .
 How did I not wake up ?
 I know .
 It was pretty bad .
 After that last one , I thought we were going through Egg Town .
 Max , you did it again .
 You roofied me , didn 't you ?
 Of course I did .
 You were crying and babbling about the Hamptons , so I had to put you down .
 You promised you wouldn 't again .
 The last time , I was out for two days .
 Yeah , I really just needed to get through Game of Thrones without someone talking during the incest .
 What is wrong with you ?
 Have you got a pen and paper ?
 You knew I didn 't want to do this .
 You never want to do anything , so I did it for you .
 You took a $450, 000 car , a car we 're not even supposed to be touching , on a joyride to the Hamptons ?
 You wanted to be here .
 You are here .
 Just enjoy it .
 I can 't enjoy it .
 Scotty to the bridge .
 This is Captain Kirk .
 Scotty to the bridge .
 You drove over the dunes and onto the beach ?
 Not intentionally .
 I tried to stop it , but this car was like ,
 " Mm , no , girl . "
 Oh , my God .
 Did it get any scratches ?
 Max , get out of the car , and help me look for scratches .
 You said you were more fun in the Hamptons .
 Not true .
 Mr. Sulu , fire all phasers .
 No scratches .
 The Lamborghini is fine .
 But thanks to you , I 'm a Rent- A- Wreck .
 Come on , we have to get this car back .
 We will .
 Jeez , relax .
 We still have time .
 Look , you said you wanted to be here .
 You 're here , and we are not leaving till you do something beach- y ,
 like walk in the water or find a half- eaten lady from Jaws .
 No . No way .
 Let 's go .
 Just take off your shoes or something .
 No .
 Just take off your shoes and feel the sand .
 Max !
 Max , stop .
 I haven 't had a proper pedicure since Justin Timberlake released a single .
 There .
 Now move your foot around .
 No .
 No .
 No !
 No .

 Oh , yeah .
 That feels nice .
 The cold sand between my toes .
 But , Max , don 't look .
 That middle nail 's a horror show .
 Too late .
 I thought it was a pistachio for a second .
 Max , how much do you love the beach ?
 I don 't know .
 I 've never been to one .
 You 've never been to a beach ?
 No .
 What 's the point ?
 I don 't own a metal detector .
 Well , time 's up .
 But we just sat down .
 I know , but if we leave right now , we 'll still have enough time to blow through a McDonald 's drive- through
 like something from Back to the Future .
 Well , I 'm gonna write our names in the sand
 ' cause it was a really nice thing for you to drug me , kidnap me , and steal my car to get me out here .
 Hey , we 're friends .
 All right , I 'll just turn this baby around .
 Uh- oh .
 What 's " Uh- oh " ?
 What is " Uh- oh " ?
 Are we stuck in the sand ?
 You have correctly identified the meaning of " Uh- oh . "
 I love that we don 't need full sentences to communicate anymore .
 Try it again .
 Nope .
 I 've had less trouble getting out of athlete 's apartments .
 Well , you 're gonna have to get out and push .
 Why do I have to push ?
 Because you 're the one who drugged me , kidnapped me , and stole my car .
 Exactly .
 I 've already done the lion 's share of the work .
 And it 's our car .
 Fine , I 'll do it .
 Door 's up , Lieutenant Uhura .
 It stopped being funny when we got stuck .
 God , don 't worry .
 I got a 600- pound woman out of a booth at the diner with my bare hands .
 I 'm fearless .
 Toss her in neutral like I did with that lady .
 Sand and heels .
 Not a good combo .
 Not a good combo .
 Not a good combo .
 Oh , all right .
 All right .
 I 'm gonna floor it .
 On the count of three .
 One , two ...
 I got excited .
 I went early .
 If I had a dime for every time I heard that ,
 I could buy this car .
 All right , let 's try again .
 One , two ...
 Okay , that was on purpose .
 A little bit . I can 't believe it .
 I can 't believe that I can 't believe it , but I really can 't believe it .
 We are in very big trouble , and we 're not even in the good Hamptons .
 I was trying to do something nice .
 First time , last time .
 You know what you are ?
 You are reckless .
 You know , all this time ,
 I thought you were a ride- or- die kind of bitch .
 I am a ride- or- die kind of bitch .
 What 's a ride- or- die kind of bitch ?
 Are you Googling " Ride- or- die kind of bitch " ?
 I would be , but I only have two bars .
 Look , we have two options :
 Get the car out of the sand , or let the tide take us .
 Put a pin in that tide thing ,
 ' cause I like the sound of it .
 We barely have enough time to get this car back to the city , or we owe $450, 000 .
 And I only have $3 , and 2 of it 's in nickels .
 Now get in the car .
 You 're hoarding nickels , and I 'm walking out of the 99 Cent Store empty- handed ?
 Now I 'm mad .
 Get ready .
 What are you doing ?
 I 'm pushing us out of here .
 Because I 'm a ride- or- die kind of bitch !
 I think .
 Now hit it !
 What 'd you do ?
 Fart us out of the ditch ?
 Seriously , Caroline , step on it .
 No , Max .
 We can 't risk getting into an accident .
 What if it 's not fatal ?
 Driving a Lamborghini slow is like going to Red Lobster and not getting the Cheddar Bay biscuits .
 Come on , we got to enjoy this car while we can .
 - Hit the gas . - All right .
 I 'll take it up to the top of my age dating window .
 40 .
 And I 'll take it to the top of mine .
 80 !
 Let go .
 Have some fun .
 No , don 't push on my leg !
 Don 't push on my --

 Yes !
 Yes !
 Best birthday ever !
 Should we Thelma and Louise it ?
 You mean drive over a cliff ?
 No , I mean wear sunglasses and hold hands .
 They drive over a cliff ?
 I never saw the end .
 There they are .
 Did you girls get the car back in time this morning ?
 Yep , just in time , thanks to Caroline .
 She was ignoring speed limit signs
 like she does homeless people .
 A state trooper called my driving criminally negligent .
 I was so proud .
 I might 've even gotten emotional , but I had to talk our way out of the ticket , and I like to be professional when my shirt 's off .
 You didn 't get a ticket ?
 Yesterday , I got arrested for just walking into Whole Foods .
 I can 't believe I still have sand in my hair .
 If the only place you still have sand is in your hair , you 're lucky .
 I 'm about to make a pearl down there .
 Oh , hey , there , destitute Barbie .
 Sorry you lost the dream car .
 Anyway , I 'll be in my booth .
 Sophie , beautiful baby ...
 I 've narrowed down the site of my proposal to three options :
 A , the place we met ...
 B , the place we 've had sex most often ... or C , the place we 've had sex most recently .
 Wait a minute .
 Wait a minute .
 All three of those places are this booth !
 That 's right .
 Sophie Kachinsky ...
 He 's proposing at the diner ?
 What 's he gonna do ?
 Put an onion ring on it ?


 I love that .
 You know , I was planning on saying no and making you beg for a few hours , but ...
 I just love you too much .
 Aw , that 's so not as gross as normal .
 Now it is .
