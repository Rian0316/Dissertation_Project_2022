 kids, in the fall of 2008, i 've had a little problem
 All right , I got to get to Stella 's . Tonight 's the night , guys .
 I 've tried it before , I 've failed every time .
 This time , I am gonna do it .
 Tonight . . .
 I pick up a lesbian .
 Robin , I need your lipstick . Oh, man !
 Take pictures , all right ? bye Ted


 Oh, man !
 What 's up , Ted ?
 Hey , Matisse .
 Hey , T- Diddy !
 - You missed it .
 - Robin got that national anchor job .
 And we got a free bottle of champagne .
 Ah , but it 's empty now .
 Oh, man !

 Sorry , we couldn 't wait .
 It was getting cold . Oh, man !
 Hey , big guy .
 What 's up , G ? Are you okay ?
 Yeah , I 'm fine .
 It 's just . . . you know , I want to hang out with you guys .
 I want to hang out with my friends .
 I just feel like I 'm spending all my time on the train .
 Okay , how about this , why don 't you ask your friends to come out here sometime ?
 That 's a great idea .
 You want us to go to New Jersey ?
 Oh , that is rich . Why ?
 Well , for starters ,
 I don 't have any of my gold medallions anymore .
 I sold them when they went out of style 400 years ago . Lily ?
 Oh , sorry , Ted .
 I 'm a born and raised New Yorker .
 I 'm programmed to despise and loathe
 New Jersey and all that it stands for . Why am I telling you this ?
 You hate New Jersey more than anyone .
 What ? I don 't hate New Jersey .
 Why would you think that ?
 And then he cut in front of me .
 God , I hate line cutters more than I hate New Jersey . Well , that 's not true .
 There 's nothing I hate more than New Jersey .
 Right ?
 Hey , you want us to wait for you ? No , I might be awhile .
 I got a drop a massive New Jersey .
 Okay , so New Jersey 's not my favorite place .
 But once Stella and I get married and she and Lucy move in with me , I 'll never set foot in New Jersey again .
 Unless I 'm going to see a Giants game or flying out of Newark or God forbid , disposing of a body .
 Ted , if you murder me and bury me in New Jersey , I 'll haunt you forever .
 But if I murder you and bury you somewhere else ? Eh , I 'll leave you alone .
 I 'm sure you had your reasons .



 kids , your Aunt Robin was sick

 I 'm Robin Scherbatsky , and you 're watching . . .
 Etro News One at 11 : 00 .
 And again at 1 : 00 .

 So hurry up and get your votes in for New York 's cutest doggie .

 Four transit workers were electrocuTed when a subway train jumped the tracks .
 Stay tuned for the . . . shocking derails .
 Joel , people died .

 Tonight will be my last broadcast .
 I came to Metro News One as a little caterpillar .
 And for four years , this desk has been my cocoon .
 But tonight , I emerge an ambitious butterfly .
 Why does she sound like an idiot ? - Did she have a stroke ?
 - Yeah . A stroke of genius .
 This speech is really good .
 With one eye on the horizon , one eye on the truth , and one eye on all of you .
 You wrote it for her , didn 't you ?
 It 's a modified version of the speech I gave when I had to leave the swim team because of a chronic inner ear situation .
 I thought you were the towel boy .
 It 's part of the team .

 Okay , Stella couldn 't find a sitter , so we can 't go out .
 Instead . . . we 're all gonna hang out here and it 's gonna be just as awesome .
 Right , we got board games , we got movies .
 And I think there may be some beer out in the garage .
 Ted , this is pathetic . It 's Saturday night .
 We should be out at a bar . drinking alcohol .
 Now I know that that sounds depressing , 也近乎于悲哀的边缘 但这就是事实 bordering on tragic , but it 's just a fact .
 Yeah, and I want another crack at that chick , Doris .
 I know I can land that lesbian plane .
 No snakes on that plane .
 Okay , guys . Come on , you promised .
 Let 's just hang out here , try to have fun .
 I mean , we 're all together , friends hanging out .
 Isn 't that what really matters ?
 Okay , if we take the next train , we can be at MacLaren 's by 11 : 00 .
 We can be there by 10 : 00 .
 No , I have to change first .
 I am not walking into MacLaren 's smelling like New Jersey .
 You guys really hate it here , huh ?
 What ? ! No ! Stela . . .
 I get it , I mean , you guys are all New Yorkers .
 You need to go hang out at a bar .
 Well , you could just hang out at the coolest bar in the state , which is so close it will blow your mind .
 And boom goes the dynamite .
 The coolest bar in New Jersey .
 Yeah , it probably is .
 This is great ! We got darts .
 Half a ping- pong table . A fish bowl .
 Look what turned out to be an awesome night as promised .
 Maybe we can drop some Bac- O 's in here and make them fight .
 No , thanks . I don 't mess with fish bowls unless they have my two favorite fish -- the sucker fish and the blow fish .
 What up !
 For " blow fish " ?
 I don 't think so .
 Marshall . You 're better than that .
 Lily . Not good enough .
 Stella ?
 Sorry .
 I am not lowering this until someone gives me the respect of another person 's knuckles tapping against mine in a light but decisive manner .
 Pretty , pretty . . . Pretty , pretty . . . Pretty . . .
 Who 's a pretty baby ?
 Then know this . . .
 until it gets what it wants , nay , deserves , this fist will not yield .
 It . Will . Not .
 Yield .
 So who wants to play Scrabble ? Sure , whatever .
 Oh , heads up , the " X " tile is little hard to read because a couple years ago , it went all the way through my dog .
 You know , maybe we should get a dog again when you move in .
 When I what ? Oh , great .
 There 's Robin .
 I thought they were moving in with you .
 So did I.
 Oh , God , am I moving to New Jersey ? Hey , guys ,
 I bet that dog was really flying high after it swallowed a little " X. "
 Nailed it !
 Come on !
 I can 't live here . It wouldn 't be that bad .
 You could put a mini - fridge over there and maybe some knock hockey .
 Knock hockey .
 Nice one , Big Mon .
 I meant New Jersey in general , not this basement . She wants me to move here ?
 I don 't get it . We discussed this months ago .
 So I was thinking after the wedding , you and Lucy could move in here .
 Yeah , she could play out on the fire escape , maybe make friends with that guy who sleeps on that couch in the alley , ride her bike up and down Broadway .
 It 's a great idea , Ted .
 I don 't understand why you 'd want to live in New Jersey when you have a chance to live in Manhattan ?
 I thought having a rent- controlled apartment on the Upper West Side was half the reason she agreed to marry me .
 Really , I thought it was the whole reason . What is up ? !
 Robin , hey ! Looking good .
 Bump the Barnacle . Stella already told me not to .
 How was your first day ?
 - It wasn 't . - What ?
 It wasn 't my first day .
 I showed up and there were 20 other people .
 It turns out , I didn 't actually get the job .
 I only got an audition .
 What , how did that happen ?
 I don 't know . Because he told me that I got it .
 I got it ? ! I got it !
 And just to be clear , when I say " you got it , " I mean an audition .
 You got an audition .
 I don 't want there to be any confusion . You have an audition only .
 Not the job .
 Thank you ! Thank you !
 Okay , I 'm going to call - and beg Joel to give me my job back .
 - No ! You haTed that job .
 I don 't know , it wasn 't so bad .
 Robin , what did they make you call Tropical Storm Hector when it was raining cats and dogs ? A furricane .
 Hey , Ted .
 Rock me like a furricane .
 Thanks .
 Mean .
 Okay , yeah , it sucks , but what can I do ?
 I mean , I 'm not going to get that other job .
 You guys should have seen the other women at this audition .
 They all had more experience than me , were more ethnic than me .
 There was an African- American chick with blue eyes , how can I compete with that ?
 Mm , you can 't .
 No , you can compete with anyone .
 You 're Robin Scherbatsky . Confident .
 Strong . Tall .
 With crazy long legs that look great in shorts .
 I 'm calling Joel .
 No , Robin , if you call him right now , you will hate yourself .
 Look , I have slept with lots of women who afterwards told me off and stormed out .
 And sometimes they 'd pick up the phone and they 'd call me and then we 'd hook up again . And when we were finished ,
 I could see that look on their faces , that look that says they hate themselves and they wish they 'd never called .
 But if you could see that look . . .
 Actually , you can see that look , there 's a video . www- dot . . . No ! Stop , okay ?
 I won 't call . Don 't drink the beer !
 I just remembered when I bought it .
 It was right before I got pregnant with Lucy .
 Ted , would you mind running to PriceCo and picking some up ? Oh , and while you 're there , maybe you could sign up for a card .
 I mean , you 'll probably end up going there all the time .
 That 's the look .
 I hate it here . I would kill myself .
 Maybe New Jersey 's not that bad . Stella has a lawn . You could get a riding lawn mower .
 They sell them over there .
 I saw one with a cup holder .
 I saw a recliner with a built- in cup holder . I even saw a hammock with a cup holder .
 You live in New Jersey , you never have to hold a cup again .
 I don 't think I have as big a problem holding cups as you do .
 I will give you $100 to fist pump me .
 $200 . Just put it down , Barney .
 Your arm must be killing you by now .

 $10, 000 . Look , you 'll be right across the river .
 You 'll be in New York all the time . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah .
 Um , excuse me .
 You guys are from New York , right ?
 Yeah , we moved here from Manhattan .
 Do you ever get into the city ?
 All the time . See ?
 All the time .
 When was the last time you were there ?
 We just had dinner at O 'Rourke 's .
 That 's been closed for six years .
 It has been awhile .
 Funny , we don 't miss it .
 Well , I guess we 're New Jersey- ians now .
 Honey , look , dog shirts .
 I can 't do it .
 I 'm just going to tell Stella she and Lucy have to move into the city and that 's that .
 Okay , what do you guys think ? Beagle or Boston terrier ?

 Are those tears ?
 They 're awesome . . . manly pain tears .
 They 're not emotional .
 Okay , they 're a little bit emotional .
 Where 's Robin ?
 Oh , no .
 Hey , Shirley , it 's Robin calling for Joel . Robin , hang up the phone .
 Don 't do this . Sorry , I know , okay ?

 Hey , Joel , it 's Robin .
 So Madam Butterfly wants to come back to the cocoon .
 Yeah , look , I 'm sorry I said all that stuff .
 Well , you can stick your sorries in your sock drawer , ' cause you 've already been replaced .
 I 've got Brian in makeup and he couldn 't be more exciTed . I can 't do this .
 I can 't do this .
 Uh , okay , look , as much as I want to see college boy here wet himself on camera , if you can get here in time to read the 11 : 00 news , you can have your old job back .
 Okay , I have a half hour to make it to the studio . There 's no way you can make it to the city in a half hour .
 Robin , don 't do this .
 I know it 's scary to bet on yourself , but if you don 't , nobody else will .
 And I 'm not just saying that to get a fist bump . Although , come on , a fist bump would be great .
 But I really mean it . I am betting on myself .
 I am betting that i can make it there by 11 o 'clock
 - Hey , did you get the beer ?
 - Yeah , I got 144- pack . The rest is in the trunk .
 And did you sign up for the membership ?
 No .
 Why not ?
 There was a line for the photos . . . my hair 's a mess . . .
 I don 't want to move to New Jersey . What ?
 I can 't do it .
 And I can 't see any reason why you and Lucy shouldn 't move to New York .
 Well , my daughter goes to school here .
 All of her friends are here . I 've lived here my whole life .
 My whole family is here .
 This is my house .
 I 'm on the PTA .
 And as of June 1 , I 'm the deputy mayor .
 Yes , but my apartment is really close to the subway .
 Ted , we 're not moving , end of discussion . How can it be end of discussion if there 's never been a discussion ?
 This is part of being a parent .
 I can 't just uproot Lucy . People with kids move all the time .
 I think it would be really great for Lucy to grow up in the greatest city in the world .
 Oh , here we go --
 New York 's the greatest city in the whole wide world . It 's where dreams come true and pigeon poop tastes like tapioca .
 Want to know a little secret , Ted ?
 New Jersey is better than New York .
 Better than . . . ?
 You think . . . ? I. . . The Empire State Buil . . .
 H and H Bage . . .
 Lincoln Ce . . . Zabar 's . . .
 Papaya King . 纽约是 New York is the intellectual and cultural hub of the planet .
 New York is full of weirdoes , and snobs and mean people .
 Ted , do you know that once , an old lady actually called me a bitch and threw a cat in my face ? And you want to know if that happened in New Jersey ?
 Uh- uh , 86th and Lex , right in front of your beloved little Papaya King .
 Ted , people are nice in New Jersey . I mean it 's the kind of place where you know your neighbors .
 Hey , I know my neighbors .
 Oh , yeah ? Like who ?
 Right across the hall , I got . . .
 Clax . . . pa . . . mon . . .
 Claxpamon ?
 His name is Paxton .
 Love that dude .
 Sorry, in a hurry .
 Got to get to the front . Got to get off first . Whoa , don 't run over Matisse .
 Okay , so this is crazy .
 You can 't actually think that New Jersey is better than New York .
 New York has Broadway .
 We win right there . Oh , no , she did not .
 Knuckle up for safety . We have Atlantic City .
 Can 't beat the A. C.
 Pretty please ? No one has to know . New York has Greenwich Village .
 New Jersey has The Shore .
 Woody Allen .
 Oscar- winning chronicler of urban neuroses .
 Bump it ! - Bruce Springsteen .
 - Sinatra .
 He 's from Hoboken . . .
 New Jersey . Yeah , but what city is he singing about ?
 It 's not " Secaucus , Secaucus . "

 Come on . . .


 Look , Stella , I understand that coming from New Jersey you don 't picture yourself loving New York , but trust me , Marshall didn 't expect to , and now he wouldn 't think of living anywhere else .
 I hate New York !
 I 'm sorry , but it 's true .
 Okay , today I was walking around PriceCo .
 Have you ever been there ?
 It 's huge . All the stores in New York are so cramped .
 Every time I turn , I knock something over .
 I 'm like some huge monster that came out of the ocean to destroy bodegas .
 But , Marshall , you love New York .
 Yeah , I do , except that I hate it .
 I 'm too big for New York , okay ?
 I 'm always trying to fit into cramped little subway seats or duck under doorways that were built 150 years ago .
 Hey , guess what ?
 People are bigger now . Build bigger doorways . What the hell is the matter with you ?
 Small city , big man -- give it up .
 And it 's so loud , all the time .
 Yes , it 's the city that never sleeps . Well , guess what , I like to sleep .
 I 've been tired for eight years .
 Tired and scared with black and blue marks on my elbows from trying to fit through all these tiny elf doorways .
 New Jersey 's great .
 It 's got huge stores , and lawns and you never have to carry a cup again . Not for the rest of your life .
 I 'm not afraid to say it --
 I love New Jersey .
 I 'm just kidding .

 Look , Stella . . . I get it , okay ?
 I see what you 're saying .
 I guess . . . we could live in Brooklyn .
 You know what , Ted . . .
 live wherever you want .
 I don 't care .
 Awkward silence .
 Tap it .
 Oh , hey , Lucy .
 What are you doing up ? There was some loud noises in the basement .
 Sorry about that . Why don 't you got back to bed , sweetie .
 I can 't go to sleep without a story .
 Okay , I 'll just get your mom . . .
 Why don 't you read it to me ?

 Okay , come on .
 * You know she thrills me with all her charms *
 * When I 'm wrapped up in my baby 's arms *
 * My little girl gives me everything *
 * When I 'm walking down the street with you *
 I 'm moving here .
 Really ?
 Really . New Jersey wins .

 Oh !
 Oh , thank you ! Wait . . .

 Good evening , New York .
 Hey , look , she made it .
 Our top story tonight -- the newborn panda at the Central Park Zoo got its first tooth today .
 I guess that makes her a . . . molar bear .
 Molar bear .
 Molar bear .
 You know what ?
 I really am done . Good night , New York .

 Wow , she really quit .
 You think we had anything to do with that ?
 Yeah , I think we did .
 Nice job , Barney .
 Oh , my God !
 Thank you !
 Oh , that was killing my arm .
 My arm hasn 't been this sore since I was 13 years old and figured out how to lock a bathroom . Up top .

 Oh , no .

 What 's wrong ?
 Well , I officially didn 't get that job .
 I 'm so sorry .
 That 's okay .
 They , um , they offered me another one . Hey , that 's great . What are you going to be doing ?
 Foreign correspondent .
 I 'm moving to Japan
