 Stella ! Great to see you ! You , too .
 And Tony ! Hey .
 Hey !
 What a nice surprise .
 " What a nice surprise " ?
 No , a nice surprise would be if a safe fell from 40 stories and smushed them both .
 I mean , you didn 't let them have it ?
 No , we had a nice friendly chat , then they went their way and I went mine .
 Ted , you blew it .
 He blew it , right ?
 Well played , sir .
 Bravo . What ? !
 You see , Robin , Ted played it cool , which is exactly what he should have done .
 As a matter of fact , I 'd say on a scale ranging from ... ( sobbing ) :
 And I kept this sweater of yours ... ... and sometimes I just sit in the bathtub for hours just , you know , just sniffing it . ... all the way to ...
 This is my new fianc ? .
 She 's basically Stella , except she 's French and , as you can see , she 's got enormous cans .


 ( giggles ) ... I 'd say you nailed it .
 I 'll do you one better .
 You , sir , got Stella thinking .
 " Gosh , Ted seemed so cool today . Did I choose the wrong guy ? "
 Give it a week ; you 'll get her back . And her front .
 ( shudders ) : Oh .
 Oh , did you just feel that ?
 I think we just had a " what up " quake . TED :
 I don 't want her back . Or her front . I just want to move on .
 And this was an important step towards that .
 To moving on . ( all murmur )


 ( knocking on door ) ( harp glissando plays )
 I made a terrible mistake . I know .
 I 'm a better person than you are .
 You totally are .
 Let 's get back together and have way more sex than before . Deal !
 ( both moaning ) ( knocking on door )
 Hello , Ted .
 ( sighs )
 No , come in . It 's not weird at all .
 Ted , Teddy Ted Ted Ted .
 ( sighs )
 I knew it was wrong to steal somebody 's fianc ? .
 I mean , I grappled with it . I was up nights .
 And not for the good reason .
 Well , sometimes for the good reason .
 I mean , Stella and I hadn 't seen each other in five years , so , as you can imagine , the beginning , it was just fast and furious .
 Lamps breaking , furniture moving . You see this bald patch ?
 Yeah , Tony ...
 Anyway , we moved on .
 Me , Lucy , Stella -- we were gonna move to L. A.
 I was gonna become a screenwriter .
 Then we bumped into you , and you just looked so ... sad .
 Sad ? No . I- I think what you 're calling sad was actually a jovial nonchalance .
 Ted , you looked awful , okay ?
 Like a little dachshund puppy with a bad back that 's got to pull itself around on a cart .
 Why are you here ?
 Look , Ted ,
 I know I can come across pretty tough , but I can 't bear to have hurt someone the way I hurt you .
 I think fate put me on that corner to make this right .
 Obviously , I can 't fill that giant crater that Stella left in your heart .
 I 've been dating . Like , a lot .
 And then I heard you got fired .
 I transitioned into small business ownership . ( clears throat )
 It 's the backbone of the economy .
 No , it 's not . Ted , my family 's got a lot of money .
 And I want to use that money to make this right with you .
 Tony is rich ?
 Oh , Ted . Oh , Ted , tell me he wrote you a check .
 Tell me he wrote you a big , fat check .
 A check so big it doesn 't take its shirt off when it goes swimming .
 ( laughs ) Ha , that is a big , fat check .
 A check so big , if you had sex with it , you wouldn 't tell your buddies .
 That is a big , fat check .
 A check so big that when you sit next to it on an airplane , you find yourself wondering whether the check should have bought two seats .
 That ... Is a big , fat check ! Yeah !
 He didn 't write me a check .
 Ted , I want to offer you a job . A job ?
 Every year , my family gives a lot of money to Columbia University , so I got some pull .
 How would you like to design ...

 ... your very own curriculum as a professor of architecture .
 ( chuckles )
 Huh ?
 No , thanks .
 What do you mean , " No , thanks " ?
 Ted , you would be a great professor , okay ?
 You are knowledgeable , you 're a good talker , and when you need to , you can grow a very handsome neck beard .
 ( both laugh ) I 'm not gonna be a professor .
 Teaching architecture is what you do when your career has totally bottomed out and you need to pay the bills .
 ( all murmuring )
 Hey , hey , hey ! Small business owner . Backbone of the economy .
 I 'm not gonna take that job , all right ? I 'm gonna be just fine .
 New topic . Okay , new topic .
 I just got a $200 speeding ticket today .
 Oh , that sucks , dude . You couldn 't talk your way out of it ?
 You can 't talk your way out of a ticket .
 I 've done it . It was -- what was it ? -- it was 1998 .
 So where 's the fire ? There 's no fire .

 Actually , uh , you know , there is a fire at this barbecue I 'm headed to . Nothing special .
 Burgers , ribs .... brats .
 Son , do you have any idea how dangerous it is to be ...
 Did you say brats ? Yeah , brats .
 My mom marinates them in Belgian beer for two days . No big .
 Funny thing was , I could 've sworn that one of those thick , succulent , hickory- smoked brats had some writing on it .
 Weird . Anyways , what were you saying ?
 What- what did it say ? The brat ?
 It said " Property of Minnesota State Trooper Jorgensen . "
 You a ... you a brat man , Officer Jorgensen ?
 You going to this address ? Mm- hmm .
 Follow me and lean on the horn . We 're gonna be running some reds .
 Well , duh .
 I would 've done that , too , if I 'd have been going to a barbecue .
 Damn , I was .
 See , it 's all about sizing up your opponent .
 I could tell that the officer was a brat man because , well , he was out of breath just from walking to my car and he had mustard on his holster .
 Marshall Eriksen !
 Manipulating an officer of the law with your sausage . MARSHALL :
 Mm- hmm . That is very hot .
 You think I can 't talk my way out of a ticket ? !
 You think I can 't talk my way out of a ticket ?
 I am Barney Stinson , master of manipulation .
 If I can talk a stripper into paying me for a lap dance ,
 I think I can talk my way out of a ticket .
 Challenge accep -- Wait for it .
 ( chuckles )
 I don 't get it .
 Oh , " Ted . " " Accep- Ted . "
 I get it now . ( knocking on door )
 What now ? You want to be an architect ? Great .
 Guy I went to private school with wants a new house built .
 Job 's yours if you want it .
 Tony , look , I don 't need your help .
 Here 's what he 's offering you .
 That is a big , fat check .
 Showtime .
 License and registration .
 Oh , of course , Officer .
 Right away .
 Sir , this is a gift certificate for a custom- tailored Italian suit .
 So , we done here ? $375 !
 Ooh !
 ( chuckles ) :
 Oh . And he kept the gift certificates . Oh , man .
 I 'm gonna call Emilio and tell him to short- sheet him on the crotch .
 You are bad at this , dude .
 Oh , whatever , Robin .
 Like you 've ever talked your way out of a ticket .
 Are you kidding me ?
 Robin 's a pretty girl . Pretty girls don 't get tickets .
 I bet Robin 's been pulled over tons of times , never once gotten a ticket .
 That is outrageous !
 And factual .
 License and regis ... ( sobbing )
 Oh , honey . Oh , no , no , no , don 't cry .
 It 's okay . No ticket for you .
 Oh . Just , uh , go a little slower next time , okay ?
 Yeah . Okay .
 Thank you .
 Yeah !
 Excuse me . I think I left something in New Jersey .
 Hey ! How did your lunch go with the rich guy ?
 Well , uh , it started off great .
 celebrates the landscape without overpowering it . Mm .
 You know , when Frank Lloyd Wright designed Fallingwater in 1935 , there 's ...
 Yes , yes , that 's all fine .
 I 'm sure you 'll do a great job .
 What I 'm really worried about is the basement .
 Specifically the laundry room .
 The laundry room ?
 I require a laundry room of 15 feet by 15 feet , stain- proof ceramic tile from floor to ceiling .
 I 'm a man who likes to do his own laundry , and sometimes , it gets messy .
 Messy ? Messy .
 Steel chains will dangle from the ceiling at a height of nine feet .
 And that is where my laundry bags will hang for three days and three nights before I ... clean them .
 Uh , Ted , it- it kind of sounds like what this guy is asking you to design ...
 It 's a murder house . It is . It 's totally a murder house .
 You know , as a martial artist ,
 I 'm trained to trust my instincts , and my instincts are saying this ... feels very good .
 The steak is so rare .
 ( shudders )
 Right ? Right ? !
 One final concern : soundproofing .
 I tend to make a lot of racket when I launder .
 I 'll show you what I mean .
 I 'm gonna go to my laundry room , and you tell me if you can hear me .
 Tony ... does something feel off about this guy ?
 Yeah . Off the hook !
 Bro , you are nailing this .
 ( chain saw revving ) ( maniacal laughter )
 Ted , you can 't design a murder house ! I 'm not gonna design a murder house .
 Ted , you can 't design a murder house ! I 'm not gonna design a murder house !
 ( engine accelerating ) ( siren blips )
 Bring it .
 Officer , please , my wife is about to have a baby !
 Her water just broke ! Where 's your wife ?
 She took the other car .
 This is Italian leather , so ... I ...
 Oh , come ...
 I 'm sorry about that murder house thing .
 That was my bad . That 's on me . So , new plan .
 You , my friend , are gonna build the Statue of Liberty a husband .
 Now , I got some suction down at City Hall . Tony , stop it !
 I don 't want your help , okay ? You don 't have to do this .
 Yes , I do . Why ?
 Because ... when you were with Stella , I know how much I missed her .
 I can only imagine you feel the same way .
 ( laughs ) Okay , well , let me put your mind a
 I don 't want Stella back , okay ?
 She lied to me and left me at the altar .
 What kind of person does that ?
 I 'm better off without her .
 She 's all yours , buddy .
 There you go . Load off my mind .



 ( knocking on door )
 Stella ... Tony broke up with me .

 Wow . Okay , Tony broke up with you ?
 He said it was because of something you said .
 You got Tony to dump Stella ?
 I am very sorry , but I 'm going to have to insist that you bump this .
 Let 's , um , let 's talk out in the hall .
 It 'll be waiting .
 So , why are you here ?
 Look , Ted , this is about seven months too late , but here goes .
 I 've been in love with Tony since high school .
 We dated for a long time , but then I got pregnant , and I guess for two 19- year- olds it was just too much to handle , so we broke up .
 And for a long time I just focused on being a mother .
 I forgot about Tony .
 I forgot about ... the very idea of being in love .
 And then you came along and reminded me . And ...
 I loved you for that .
 I loved you so much , in fact , that it was just shy of enough .
 But I never stopped loving Tony .
 Take him back , honey . He 's sorry .
 No , that 's- that 's not ... that 's not what 's happening .
 Just go back inside , Mrs. Matsen .
 ( door closes )
 It was good seeing you , Stella .
 Can you talk to Tony ?
 What ?
 He 'd listen to you . You changed his mind . You could change it back .
 I know it 's an awful thing to ask ...
 Yeah , it 's an awful thing to ask .
 Well , I don 't know what else to do , okay ?
 I love him .
 Oh , you love him . So what , you 're- you 're appealing to the romantic in me ?
 Is that your strategy ?
 Because that guy 's gone .
 You can 't pull those strings anymore .
 They 're not attached to anything thanks to you .
 Go ahead , honey , kiss him !
 Go inside , Mrs. Matsen !
 Mrs. Matsen , go inside !
 Okay , you can do this . You can do this !

 License and regis ...
 License and registration .
 Excuse me ?
 I can only assume you need a license to have a face that beautiful .
 And that body ?
 with the proper authorities .
 Get out of the car . Why , am I under arrest ?
 No ... but you 're about to be under me .
 No . False . Did not happen .
 That 's a line from a porno . I 've seen that porno .
 Hell , I 've made that porno .
 When will you guys realize that the only difference between my real life and a porno is my real life has better lighting ?
 You 're lying .
 I am not lying !
 I swear on my mother .
 I swear on Goliath National Bank .
 I swear on my suits .
 I ... am ... not ... lying .

 Go ahead , honey , kiss him .
 Go inside , Mrs. Matsen !
 Mrs. Matsen , go inside !
 Is there anything I can do to make this better ?
 No .
 * Let 's go to the mall , everybody ! *
 Hello .
 Ted , it 's me ! It 's Barney It 's me !
 I need your help ! I 'm in big trouble !
 Whoa- whoa- whoa , slow down . What happened ?
 I 'm guessing something with the proper authorities .
 Get out of the car . Why , am I under arrest ?
 Yes , you are . I ran your plates .
 You 've had 15 moving violations in the last three days .
 Get out of the car .
 But no , my wife 's having a baby !
 I have a sausage with your name on it ! Out of the car now ! ( screaming )
 I need you to come to Brazzaville , New Jersey and bail me out .
 I 'm kind of in the middle of something .
 Hurry , Ted .
 You have no idea of the kind of the hardened criminals they 've got me in here with .
 Are we gonna get our spray paint back ?
 Save me , Ted !
 You want to do something for me ?
 I need a ride to New Jersey . Okay .
 You 'll pay for tolls , right ? I 'm kidding .

 Oh , by the way , Ted , how 's that girl you 've been seeing ?
 That super hot French chick with the big enormous boobs ?
 Oh , you mean Claudette ? She 's , uh , she 's fine .
 Man , she 's the hottest girl you have ever been with , Ted . Ever !
 Bye , Stella . Bye .
 Ted ...
 I 'm so sorry again about everything .
 For what it 's worth ...
 I 'll talk to Tony .
 Really ?
 I want you to be happy , Stella .
 I 'll talk to him .






 Okay , but just tell me this . Why Tony ?
 I mean , is it the money , the kung fu pajamas ? Like , what ... what is it ?
 He 's the one .
 The one .
 Yeah , I know it 's kinda sappy , but , yeah .
 Okay , I 'm gonna say something out loud that I 've been doing a pretty good job of not saying out loud lately .
 What you and Tony have -- what I thought for a second you and I had ... ... what I know that Marshall and Lily have ...
 I want that . I do .
 I keep waiting for it to happen and waiting for it to happen , and ...
 I guess I 'm just , um ...
 I 'm tired of waiting .
 And that is all I 'm going to say on that subject .
 You know , I once talked my way out of a speeding ticket ?
 Really ?
 I was heading upstate to my parents ' house doing , like , 90 on this country road , and I got pulled over .
 So this cop gets out of his car . He kind of swaggers on over and he 's , like , " Young lady , I have been waiting for you all day . "
 So I looked up at him and I said , " I 'm so sorry , Officer . I got here as fast as I could . "
 ( chuckles ) : For real ? ( laughs softly ) :
 No . It 's an old joke .
 I know that you 're tired of waiting , and you may have to wait a little while more , but she 's on her way , Ted .
 And she 's getting here as fast as she can .
 Bye , Stella .
 Good- bye , Ted . * If it ever ends
 * And somehow , you have shattered my defense *
 * And this is gonna hurt
 * If it ever starts
 * So promise you 'll be careful
 * With my heart
 She tracked me down two days later using a phone book .
 And that 's the last time I wrote my name in my undergarments .
 ( both chuckle )
 Hey . Hey , Lily ! Lily !
 You 're back !
 Barney , when you told me that peanut butter and jam joke ,
 I was completely disgusted .
 But I was in the shower this morning and it popped into my head and it actually made me laugh .
 Peanut butter .
 So I can see now how I may have overreacted .
 Marshall 's words , not mine .
 Well , it 's good to see you again , Lily . Thanks .
 So what have you been up to ?
 I 'm going to an amnesia ward with a bunch of photos of my children and a wedding ring .
 I 'm gonna find the hottest patient/ my wife , and we are going ...
 Okay , so that 's good enough for tonight .
 I gotta ease back into this . See you tomorrow !
