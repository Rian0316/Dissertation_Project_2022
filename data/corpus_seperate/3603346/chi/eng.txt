 Well , there was this girl .
 What did you do ?
 Nothing .
 Really , it was just kissing .
 All right .
 So , we 're still getting married ?
 Yes .
 Because we love each other .
 Yes .
 And it 's the happiest day of our life .
 Don 't push it .
 I need some time to take a step back and reevaluate our situation .
 Oh .
 Bye , Sheldon .
 Well , Gollum ... ... you 're an expert on rings .
 What do I do with this one ?

 So , what package are you thinking ?
 Mm , this one comes with music and flowers .
 Oh , they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet .
 Why would we want that ?
 ' Cause there 's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don 't believe they can land a short , nearsighted scientist .
 Let 's give them hope .
 Whatever .
 Put us on the Internet .
 I 've always wanted a wedding with a comment section .
 I- If you 're not into this , we can do it another time .
 No .
 No , I want to .
 Look , we 've put this off long enough .
 Let 's do it . Aw .
 That 's exactly what you said the first time we slept together .
 Oh , excuse me .
 Sheldon .
 Hey .
 Leonard , have you gotten married yet ?
 No .
 Why ?
 Good .
 Don 't do it !
 Why not ?
 Some important new information has come to light .
 Women are the worst .
 I thought it was paper cuts , but I was wrong .
 No piece of paper ever cut me this deep .
 What happened now ?
 Amy has ended our relationship .
 Oh , no .
 Seriously ?
 What 's going on ?
 Amy broke up with Sheldon .
 She did ?
 Is Penny crying ?
 No .
 No , of course not .
 They thrive on our suffering .
 Buddy , I- I 'm so sorry .
 Is there anything I can do ?
 Yes .
 If I ever talk about going out with a girl again , roll your eyes at me
 like I do to you when you say dumb things .
 Sheldon , uh , o- okay , just because you 're going through this with Amy doesn 't mean that all women are bad .
 Whatever .
 Hey , I just heard about you and Sheldon .
 Are you okay ?
 Not really .
 Can you come over ?
 Uh , actually I 'm in Vegas .
 Leonard and I are about to get married .
 Hold on .
 You 're getting married and you didn 't invite me ?
 Well , it was kind of a spur- of- the- moment thing .
 Wow .
 Hope I can catch the bouquet from here .
 Amy , don 't be like that .
 Why did I just hear Amy 's name ?
 Penny 's on the phone with her .
 Did she say anything about me ?
 Never mind .
 I don 't care .
 Well , if you care , you can find out and tell me .
 Just don 't be shocked when you find out that I don 't care .
 Okay , will you relax ?
 You 're not missing anything special .
 Hey .
 She 's upset .
 Look , it 's gonna be a great wedding .
 Look at you in your little suit .
 Amy 's upset ?
 Is it about me ?
 No , I think it 's because we 're eloping .
 Your marriage is causing her pain ?
 Yeah , great , I take it back .
 Go ahead and do it .

 Original Air Date on September 2


 Hello .
 Oh !
 What are you doing here ?
 When last we spoke , you said you needed time .
 Well , it 's only been 11 hours .
 trilogy was nearly 11 hours .
 I made you watch that , you said it was an eternity .
 Sheldon , when I 'm ready to talk , I 'll let you know .
 Very well .
 You seem to be headed somewhere .
 May I walk with you ?
 Sure .
 Boy , I 'm glad we 're going out again .
 We 're not back together .
 Why ?
 Is there someone else ?
 Just couldn 't wait for that first notch on your bedpost , could you ?
 If you must know ,
 I 'm going to Howard and Bernadette 's to watch the wedding .
 And who 's this guy you 're taking ?
 There 's no guy !
 Oh , you 're going to a wedding alone ?
 That 's sad .
 I 'm not gonna be alone .
 I 'll be with my friends .
 friends ?
 Well , I think you mean friends .
 And why wasn 't I invited to this ?
 Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward .
 We make everyone feel awkward .
 That 's our thing !
 They 're running a little behind .
 Should be pretty soon .
 Okay .
 Hey , if you 're hungry , there 's a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door .
 Thanks , but I don 't like glitter on my scrambled eggs .
 I don 't think the strippers prepare the meal , but okay .
 Look , it- it 's not how I pictured it either , but I 'm still glad we 're doing it .
 Me , too .
 You sure ?
 Yes .
 And you promise you 're okay with everything from the car ?
 Oh , my God , would you stop bringing it up ?
 You 're right .
 I 'm sorry .
 We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it .
 So what do you think ?
 Should we run next door and grab a bite ?
 What if they call our names ?
 Oh , don 't worry .
 They gave me this vibrating coaster .
 Oh , and the fairy tale continues .
 Thank you for doing this .
 Our pleasure .
 You feeling okay ?
 We were together for so long ,
 I honestly don 't know what I 'm feeling .
 Well , that 's understandable .
 You forgot .
 It 's called " happy . "
 Howard .
 I 'm not saying anything bad .
 Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon .
 I know what you 're going through .
 My- my last breakup was pretty tough .
 Oh .
 What was her name ?
 Hey , it 's a true story .
 I don 't need the third degree .
 For God 's sake , Sheldon , what are you doing ?
 I didn 't want to come in .
 I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable .
 So I 'll just stay out here and pretend that I don 't have to go to the bathroom .
 Howard , do something .
 I 'm on it .
 Sheldon , you being here might not be making things better .
 I see .
 And is that why everybody was invited but me ?
 They didn 't invite everybody but you .
 Bernadette invited me , and Stuart lives here .
 Who wants hot cinnamon rolls ?
 So , when you hear the music , that 's your cue .
 Any questions ?
 Oh , the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals .
 Where are the rose petals ? !
 We 're out !
 You know what ?
 It 's fine .
 We can use the potpourri from the bathroom !
 Really , we 're good .
 Yup , just want to get married .
 Yeah .
 Great .
 I 'll see you two up there .
 This is it .
 I know .
 I love you .
 I love you , too .
 Was that a yes or no on the potpourri ? !
 No , thank you !
 We 're good !
 Raj , you 're probably wondering why Amy and I aren 't showing any affection to one another .
 Didn 't even crack the top ten .
 Well , you should know that she recently broke up with me .
 I said I needed time to think .
 I 'm sure you guys will figure something out .
 You hear that ?
 Raj is devastated .
 Sheldon , shh .
 The wedding 's starting .
 I see what 's happening .
 Sides are forming .
 Well , if Bernadette 's on Amy 's team , I pick Howard .
 I 'm not taking sides .
 Fine , I guess I 'm stuck with Raj .
 Really ?
 At least you got picked .
 Before I go any further , have either of you prepared your own vows ?
 Yes .
 No .
 You wrote vows ?
 Yeah .
 Well , I don 't have any .
 You 're kind of making me look bad .
 It 's okay .
 I- I don 't have to say them .
 No , no , no , go ahead .
 I 'll come up with something mushy , you 'll cry , we got this .
 " Penny , we are made of particles
 " that have existed since the moment the universe began .
 " I like to think those atoms traveled
 " 14 billion years through time and space to create us , so that we could be together and make each other whole . "
 Wow .
 Penny ?
 Right .
 Um ... okay .
 Leonard , I mean , you 're not only the love of my life .
 I mean , you 're my best friend , and ... ... you 've got a friend in me .
 You got troubles .
 I got 'em , too .
 There isn 't anything I wouldn 't do for you .
 We stick together , and we can see it through ,
 ' cause ... you 've got a friend in me .
 Is that the song from
 He loves that movie .
 I do .
 Aw , that was beautiful .
 Yeah .
 I mean , not like our wedding beautiful .
 No , we totally won .
 Amy , I don 't understand , are we broken up or not ?
 It 's like you can 't make up your mind .
 It 's because you 're not giving me any space to think .
 Well , you should think fast , because men can sire offspring their entire lives , but those eggs you 're toting around have a sell- by date .
 You know what , Sheldon , you 've made this really easy .
 You 're immature , you 're selfish , you just insulted me to my face .
 I don 't need any more time to think .
 We 're broken up .
 Amy ...
 Will someone take me home ?
 Come on , I 'll give you a ride . ... symbolizes your eternal love .
 Yeah .
 I now pronounce you husband and wife .
 We did it !
 I 'm so glad you guys could watch !
 We 'll say it was beautiful in the comment section .
 No , no , no .
 Hang on .
 I believe I 'm supposed to carry you across the threshold .
 Can you ?
 Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV ?
 Okay , let 's do it .
 You gonna make it ?
 I 'm okay !
 Nicely done !
 Thank you .
 Finally , there 's a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn 't disappointed in me .
 Well , the night is still young .
 Everything all right ?
 Yeah .
 I guess .
 Just tell me .
 It 's just , when we were kissing ,
 I couldn 't help but picture you with that other girl .
 Oh , no .
 No , come on .
 I have a friend in you .
 You said so .
 You 're right .
 Just forget it .
 Yeah .
 Okay , listen .
 Uh ...
 If you 're imagining that it was sexy , it wasn 't .
 We- we were both drunk , and she smelled like an ashtray .
 The boat was moving a lot , so I chipped her tooth .
 Did you feel guilty ?
 No , she had dental insurance .
 Did you feel guilty after kissing her ?
 Yes .
 I felt guilty as soon as it happened .
 I feel guilty every time I see her .
 What do you mean , every time you see her ?
 What ... do I mean ?
 Boy , that 's a toughie .
 You still see her ?
 Well , no , not socially .
 But , you know , just at work .
 You work with her ? !
 How could you not tell me that ? !
 I wanted to tell you in the car , but you told me to stop talking !
 Oh , okay .
 So you 're saying this is my fault ?
 No , of course not .
 Okay , l- look , instead of fighting , why don 't we dim the lights , um , get naked and make a baby ?

 I was trying to lighten the mood .
 It 's not easy .
 You try it .
 Hello , Mother .
 Shelly !
 How 's my baby doing ?
 I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers .
 Unless you 're open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head .
 Oh , what 's going on ?
 She broke up with me .
 Oh , Shelly .
 No , I 'll be okay .
 But I think that I 'd like to send the ring back to you .
 Well , let 's not be hasty .
 Are you sure it 's over for good ?
 It 's over for me .
 I 'm done with women .
 Like when I swore off Pop Rocks .
 They both hurt you on purpose .
 You want to tell me what happened ?
 Are you going to say it 's all part of God 's plan ?
 Good chance .
 Then no , thank you .
 Well , honey , don 't send it back yet .
 Your sister 's married , and I 'm not letting your brother give my grandmother 's ring to that whore he 's dating .
 Wasn 't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute ?
 When your idiot brother redeems mankind , he can date whoever he wants .
 I know it hurts now , but it 's gonna get better .
 Yeah .
 Everything 's gonna be okay .
 You 've got so much to offer .
 Thank you .
 Any man would be lucky to have you .
 That 's true .
 I just hope I did the right thing .
 I 'm sure you did .
 Maybe that 's the problem -- you always do the right thing .
 Maybe it 's time to do the wrong thing .
 Like you 're doing right now ?
 Exactly .
 I asked you over and over if you were okay .
 Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren 't ?
 I thought I was okay , but it turns out I 'm not .
 Okay , listen , I may not have been entirely faithful , but you , you are not easy to lift !
 Wow !
 Well , marriage must agree with you .
 Well , you are just glowing .
 I 'm not glowing .
 I 'm upset .
 Well , whatever it is , it agrees with you .
 Knock , knock , knock , Penny ?
 Knock , knock , knock , Penny ?
 Knock , knock , knock , Penny ?
 What 's this ?
 Leonard told me what happened , so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage .
 Oh .
 That 's so sweet of you .
 Yeah .
 I know .
 Turns out , being sweet isn 't enough to keep a girl these days .
 I blame Madonna .

 I 'm sorry to hear about you and Amy .
 Well , I 'm sorry about Leonard .
 Thought I raised him better than that .
 You know , it 's bad enough what happened , but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university .
 He does ?
 Who is it ?
 Some girl named Mandy .
 Mandy Chao ?
 Yeah .
 Oh , you don 't need to worry about her .
 She 's brilliant and attractive .
 She can do way better than Leonard .
 That 's great .
 Wait a minute .
 I know this may sound farfetched , but I 'm on the market now .
 You know , if I dated Mandy , that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson .
 That 's ridiculous .
 Oh , you 're right .
 I could never be with a woman whose self- esteem was so low she 'd be with Leonard .
 I 'm with Leonard .
 Yeah , I know .
 Forever .
 Who would have believed these things would happen to us ?
 Right ?
 I can 't believe Amy actually went through with it .
 Hang on .
 You knew that she was going to end it with me ?
 Did you try and stop her ?
 I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy .
 Do what makes her happy ?
 She plays the harp and her car is paid for .
 How much happier can she be ?
 Okay , look , it 's not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend .
 I see .
 Well ...
 I think I 'll be going .
 Sheldon ... No , no , no , no .
 We are done here .
 Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me ?
 Sure .
 Thank you .
 And slam it hard , because I am pretty steamed .
 All right , Leonard , hang in there .
 Talk to you tomorrow .
 What happened ?
 They just got married .
 I don 't know .
 It 's a mess .
 They had a huge fight in Vegas .
 Think they 'll break up ?
 I don 't know .
 Sounds pretty bad .
 Penny 's back in her apartment all by herself .
 Really ?
 Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women ?
 Sure , let 's make it an even hundred .
 You would never kiss me and make me say " I love you " and then break up with me .
 I wouldn 't .
 And you know why ?
 ' Cause you 're a man .
 The champagne of genders .
 Well , I may be a man , but I think I 'm the one that screwed up on this one .
 Yeah , well , and you admit it , like a man .
 All you hear women say is ,
 " I 'll just have a salad . "
 You know ?
 " Where 's my lip gloss ? "
 " I think this element should be called radium . "
 That last one was Madame Curie .
 I figured that out .
 You know what ?
 She was kind of an honorary man .
 She had a penis made of science .
 Can 't believe I 'm spending my wedding night with you .
 Really ?
 I never imagined it any other way .
