 00 : 00 : 03, 126 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 619 WOLOWlTZ : So , how does this game work ?

 I just throw it , like a real ball ?
 Yeah , just nice and easy , right over the plate .
 All right .
 You suck , Wolowitz !
 What 's that about ?
 I 'm heckling you . It 's a beloved part of baseball .
 SHELDON :
 He 's right .
 And given that you 're probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade ,
 I 'm sure you do suck .
 Hi .
 What 's going on ?
 Baseball .
 Okay , this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play .
 He 's practicing .
 For what ?
 The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch , so guess who they called ?
 What , you ?
 Really ? !
 Well , a lot of people who weren 't available , but then me !
 That 's so cool !
 Congratulations .
 I guess that makes you the athlete of the group .
 Well , not just him !
 May I remind you that you 're talking to the seeker , beater , chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team .
 I know .
 Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn 't something you forget .
 C 'mon now , throw one .
 All right , here we go .
 You look like a jackass ! Cut it out !
 You 're hurting my feelings !
 Now you know why we 're not outside . ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ...

 Original Air Date on September 29 , 2014
 Did you enjoy my lecture ?
 No , and neither did our waiter .
 Well , if you 're going to serve Cornish game hen , you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it .

 It 's hard to argue with that .
 And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail .
 Hey , how was dinner ?
 Good , I had Cornish game hen .
 Oh , that poor waiter .
 Sheldon , how about tomorrow night we see a movie ?
 You guys are going out two nights in a row ?
 I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip , and I 'm contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement .
 That 's so hot .
 It 's better than hot , it 's binding .
 If you 're free tomorrow night ,
 I 'd love to have you join us on a double date . Aw ...
 You are aware that a double date doesn 't count as two dates .
 Oh .
 Well , then come or don 't .
 I don 't care .

 I can 't believe you 're sore .
 Hey , even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game .
 But they throw an actual ball .
 You were throwing air at a TV .
 For your information ,
 I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five .
 I 'm kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people .
 They 're doing Space Day and NASA asked me .
 I felt like I couldn 't say no .
 Okay .
 Well , if you want , I could help you practice .
 I played a lot of softball growing up .
 Thank you , that would be great .
 Great .
 And while we 're at it , maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound .

 What 's wrong with the way I run ?
 Oh , just kidding .
 Nothing .
 Sheldon , I 'm surprised you 'd choose to go to a pub .
 At our committee meeting ,
 Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park , but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon .
 I then suggested a pub . Yeah , which I was initially skeptical of until
 I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding .
 You don 't even like Yorkshire pudding .
 No , it 's yucky , but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy , yum- yum .
 After a lively debate , that proposal passed by a two- zero margin .
 Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive .
 ( quiet laugh )
 Ignore them , Amy .
 They 're just jealous because they 'll never have a relationship as good as ours .
 Isn 't this when he says " bazooka " or something ?
 I wasn 't making a joke , I was merely stating fact .
 Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours .
 You don 't honestly think that , do you ?
 Y ...
 Leonard , I assumed you knew .
 The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is : me and Amy ,
 Howard and Bernadette , Raj and his girlfriend ,
 Penny and Chardonnay , Penny and you .
 LEONARD : There isn 't any ranking .
 And if there were , we wouldn 't be at the bottom of it .
 Yeah , and actually , I drink Sauvignon Blanc .
 That 's the part you have a problem with ?
 Relax . AMY : There they go , fighting again .
 You 'd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc .

 So you never played baseball as a kid , not even Little League ?
 Well , I was going to , but the day of tryouts
 I found my dad 's collection .
 Threw my arm out .
 All right , the pitcher 's mound in Major League Baseball is 60 feet , six inches away from home plate .
 Great .
 You take this and say when to stop


 How much further ?
 Keep going .

 How about now ?
 I 'll let you know .

 Are you saying " stop " and we 're just too far away to hear you ?
 Okay , stop .

 Are you kidding me ? !
 That 's 60 feet .
 There 's no way this is 60 feet .
 I 'm looking at it .
 You realize this isn 't one of those times
 I want you to exaggerate how long something is .




 Okay , I got to ... I- I just ...
 I got to ask : what makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn 't ?
 For starters , we enjoy spending time together .

 So do we .
 And I 've seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things .
 It 's called parallel play .
 Yeah , toddlers do that .
 Not as well as we do . ( clicks tongue )

 You believe this guy ?
 He has to be the best at everything .
 So what ? Why do you even care ? Oh , listen to them .
 Not even married and the honeymoon 's over .
 Whatever .
 You can 't even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement .
 If you 've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract ,
 I 'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a " relationship agreement " called the U. S. Constitution .

 And it may not be cool to say so , but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today .
 It 's a good thing I 'm not wearing flag underwear right now , 'cause there 's about to be a fire .
 ( mouthing )
 Okay , it 's not that hard .
 You just look to where you want to throw it , step towards where you want to throw , and throw it .

 That 's your help ?
 That 's like saying , " Here 's how you fly a plane : " get in the airplane , know where you want to go and fly it . "

 Just throw the ball .
 Let 's see what we 're working with .

 Come on Howard , fire it in .

 Throw the damn ball !



 So when do you guys plan on getting married ?
 Uh , we 're not sure .
 But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I 'm not pregnant .
 May I have one of your fries ?
 Of course .
 Can I have a bite of your burger ?
 Absolutely not .
 Some perfect couple .
 He won 't even share his food with her .
 It has avocado on it .
 She 's allergic to avocado .
 Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die ?
 I 'm not jealous .
 I just think it 's silly for you to compare relationships
 like they 're something that can be quantified .
 Everything is quantifiable .
 That French fry ?
 A seven .
 Spider- Man ? A nine .
 The number nine -- oddly , only a four .
 How ridiculous is he ?
 A hundred .

 Sheldon , you 're just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion .
 No , I 'm not .
 French fries have three variables -- crispiness , saltiness and shape .
 Which is why a curly fry only gets a two . If I wanted curls for dinner , I 'd order a clown wig .
 Well , a relationship is more complicated than a French fry .
 Not according to the work of Berscheid , Snyder and Omoto .
 Oh , what did those rascals do now ?
 They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory , which predicts the stability of a couple based on behavior .
 Yeah , not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory .
 That 's pure Cooper .
 So , this is accurate ?
 It 's been around for 25 years , and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers .
 Well , kind of takes the romance out of relationships .
 Kind of ?
 It does it perfectly .
 Sheldon and I got an eight- point- two out of ten .

 Fine .
 We 'll take it right now .
 No , don 't . What ?
 Just don 't take it .
 Why not ?
 ' Cause it 's stupid . Who cares what number it is ?
 Come on .
 It 'll be fun .
 I said I don 't want you to .
 I 'm getting another drink .
 Sorry .
 I 'm gonna let you count this as two dates .
 They 're a lot of work .
 Think he 's getting any better ?

 Yup . WOLOWlTZ :
 That was a close one !
 Okay !
 Is it too late for him to cancel ?
 I think so .
 ( hollow , metallic bang )
 WOLOWlTZ :
 Heads up !
 Watch out !


 Are you mad at me ?
 No , stop being stupid . Um ... whew ?

 Is this about the test , or is this about us ?
 Look , I don 't need a score on a test to make me worry about something I 'm already worried about .
 What are you worried about ?
 ( scoffs )
 That we 're engaged and have nothing in common , and it scares me .
 Yeah , that scares me , too .
 It does ? Sometimes .
 Well , that 's not good !
 You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on !
 Okay , well , this might make you feel better .
 Uh , we 're both scared that our marriage will be a disaster , and so , that 's something that we have in common .
 Also , we both think I 'm not funny .
 ( quiet , nervous laugh )
 Huh ?
 See , you 're not laughing .
 ( Skype ringing )
 Hey , Froot Loops , what 's up ? Hey , Mike .
 Listen , NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game .
 You got any advice ?
 Yeah .
 Don 't do it .
 What else you up to ?
 Why shouldn 't I do it ?
 There 's no upside .
 If you do well , no one cares .
 And if you screw up , you 're an idiot on YouTube forever .

 But it 's for a good cause .
 What about all the kids that 'll be there ? That 's what I 'm telling you .
 Kids are the worst .
 My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose .
 Well , maybe I 'll do a good job .
 I don 't know .
 In space , you couldn 't even toss me a pen , and that was in zero gravity .

 Okay , thanks for the pep talk .
 Anytime , Froot Loops .
 Give your wife a hug for me .
 She 's so much cuter than you , I don 't know how you ever got her .
 ( Skype blips off )
 He 's so nice .

 Hey , sorry about that .
 No , we 're sorry .
 We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place .
 Why ? We won .
 You know , I say , next , we take on Koothrappali and his dog .
 Really give ourselves a challenge .
 I just want to say one more thing about this .
 Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we 're a bad couple .
 The answer is one simple test away .
 Hmm ? You know , it 's like when I thought there was a possum in my closet .
 Did I sit around wondering ?
 No , I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag .
 I killed his Chewbacca slippers .

 Let 's just take the test . No , no , no , I don 't want to .
 Oh , well , 'cause you know we 're gonna do bad .
 Because it doesn 't matter .
 I don 't care if we 're a ten or a two .
 Or a one .
 A one is possible .
 Marriage is scary .
 You 're scared , I 'm scared . But it doesn 't make me not want to do it .
 It- it just ... makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you .
 Leonard ...

 It would make me so happy if you said things like that .
 We got an eight- point- two .
 Trust me , you 're happy .

 Mm !
 I love how they put a waterfall at center field .
 It really ties the whole stadium together .
 Look at you , talking sports .

 This is fun , huh ? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch , have a hot dog , watch the game .
 Whoa .
 Nobody said anything about watching the game .
 Sheldon , what did you expect ?
 I expected to see Howard throw the baseball , finish my hot dog , and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey 's Soundsational Parade .
 I 'll tell you what .
 If we stay , I 'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead .
 Who 's the bobblehead of ?
 Does it matter ?
 No , as long as it bobbles .

 Howie , I am so proud of you .
 Thanks .
 I 'm proud of me , too .
 Mm- hmm .
 You ready ?
 Let 's do it .
 All right .
 Wish me luck .
 Go get 'em . Ladies and gentlemen , in honor of Space Day at Angel Stadium , the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz . ANNOUNCER ( over P. A. ) :


 ( applause , cheering and whooping )
 Thank you .
 Thank you . Can he really throw a ball ? On our Quidditch team , he ...
 Yeah , that 's a " no . "
 I have a message for the young people here today .
 When I was asked to throw the first pitch , a little voice in my head said I couldn 't do it .
 So , I practiced and practiced , and you know what ?
 That little voice ... ( laughs ) ... was right , but ... ... then I remembered that I 'm not an athlete .
 I 'm a scientist .
 So , today 's first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science .
 Ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls , I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover !
 ( applause and cheering ) ( whoops )
 And here 's the wind- up ... and the pitch !
 ( whirring )



 Why is it going so slow ? !
 ' Cause I 'm an idiot who didn 't think this through !
 Okay , new plan .
 We go to Disneyland , play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer 's Island , and then come back and see the end of the pitch .
 ( crowd booing )

 Okay , while we 're waiting for the ball to arrive , here 's some fun facts about Mars .
 KOOTHRAPPALl :
 You suck , Wolowitz !
 He makes a valid point !
 ( crowd booing )
 Okay , booing isn 't gonna make it go any faster !
