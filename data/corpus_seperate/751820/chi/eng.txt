 ( THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENT )
 ( FlNAL WHlSTLE BLOWS )
 - Coming for a drink in the board room , Jim ? - Thanks .

 Ah , well , better enjoy it while the club 's still here . - We 've always survived .
 - It 's different this time . - Tell him , Brian .
 - We 've had a meeting of the finance committee .
 Aston Wanderers will have to call in the Receiver ! - You mean bankrupt ?
 - The final whistle .
 - We need one- and- a- half million quid , Jim .
 - The government waste that every 30 seconds ! - Oh , I say !
 - You know what people are saying , Jim ?
 It 's no good having a Cabinet Minister for an MP .
 Better a local lad with time for his constituency . - That 's absurd ! - Why ?
 - There are advantages if an MP 's in the Cabinet .
 - We haven 't noticed them , have we , Harry ?
 - Such as ?
 - It reflects well on the constituency .
 It 's good to have powerful friends , influence in high places , a friend in need ...
 Listen , friend , what we need is one- and- a- half million quid !
 Ah .
 So will you use that influence to help us ?
 Well , when I said influence , I meant the indefinable sort , the intangible , subtle benefit of an input into broad general policy at its early stages while keeping constituency interests in mind .

 Do you mean no ?
 Well , anything I can do in a broad , general sense to further the cause , I will certainly ... ... er , do .
 If I can .
 But for a minister to pump one- and- a- half million into his local football club !
 He means no .
 But there 'd be lots of votes in it .
 You 'd be the hero of the constituency .
 " Jim Hacker , the man who saved Aston Wanderers ! " Safe seat for life !
 That might occur to the press . And the opposition . And the judge !
 If this club goes to the wall it 'll be a disaster .
 Look at our history !
 FA Cup winners , League Champions , first team into Europe .
 I know all that , but be fair .
 It 's a local matter , not a ministerial one .
 As chair of the Arts and Leisure Committee , can you help ? Me ?
 You 're joking .
 I spent half of yesterday trying to raise 711 quid to repoint the chimney on the art gallery .
 That miserable place ?
 Why not let it fall down ?
 I 'd love to , but if it fell on somebody , the Council 's liable .
 We own the bloody place ! And we keep getting offers for the site .
 Savefair Supermarkets were after it last month .
 Hold on , how much were they offering ?
 About two million quid , I think .
 If you sold the art gallery , you could save the football club . - There 'd have to be a planning enquiry .
 - Can we see it ?
 We 'll have to be quick .
 They close at five .

 - Hideous , isn 't it ?
 - It 's a Grade II listed building .
 Bernard , what is our political master up to with the Corn Exchange Art Gallery ?
 - Oh , er , how did you find out about that ?
 - Not from you , Bernard .
 An omission you may care to explain .
 - Surely it 's just a constituency matter ?
 - Surely not .
 Selling the gallery to Savefair Supermarkets and giving an interest- free loan to Aston Wanderers , he 's acting as an MP not a minister .
 It is the principle , Bernard .
 Have you thought what the effect would be if this happens ?
 - He 'd be very popular .
 - Exactly !

 Distressingly popular .
 Hideously popular . And then ?
 - The minister would be re- elected .
 - And that is not our top priority .
 In this department , it makes little difference who the minister is .
 But the point is , suppose other football clubs got into difficulties ?
 And what about greyhound racing ?
 Should dog tracks be subsidised as well as football clubs ?
 - Why not , if that 's what the people want ?
 - Bernard ... ... subsidy ... ... is for art , for culture .

 It is not to be given to what the people want !
 It is for what the people don 't want but ought to have !
 If they want something they 'll pay for it themselves !
 No , we subsidise education , enlightenment , spiritual uplift . Not the vulgar pastimes of ordinary people .
 It 's the thin end of the wedge .
 It must be stopped ! - Ah , Minister .

 - Humphrey . What 's the matter now ?

 Minister , I thought you 'd like early warning that there 's a reshuffle in the offing .
 ( HE GASPS )
 - You don 't mean ...
 You 're not suggesting ... - No , no , no , Minister .
 There is to be a departmental reorganisation .
 A real reshuffle . - We may get extra responsibilities .
 - Do we want them ?
 We want all responsibilities , Minister , if they mean extra staff and bigger budgets .
 It 's the breadth of our responsibilities that makes us important , makes YOU important , Minister .
 When you see vast buildings , huge staff and massive budgets , what do you conclude ?
 Bureaucracy ?

 No , Minister , you conclude that at the summit there are men of great stature and dignity who hold the world in their hands and tread the earth like princes .

 Yes , I see .
 So each new responsibility must be seized eagerly and each old one guarded jealously .
 - Entirely in your interests , of course , Minister .
 - Thank you for warning me , Humphrey . Thank you , Minister .
 Oh !
 By the way ...

 - About the Corn Exchange Art Gallery proposal .
 - What about it ?
 It 's the most imaginative scheme , novel idea ,
 - but I wonder if it might not be a little unwise ? - Why ?
 - A valuable civic amenity .
 - A monstrosity !
 A valuable civic monstrosity .
 - An important collection of British paintings . - Utterly unimportant .
 Second- rate 18th- century portraits , third- rate 19th- century landscapes , modern paintings the Tate wouldn 't even store .
 But an important representative collection of unimportant paintings .
 And a source of great spiritual uplift to passing citizenry . - They never go in !
 - But they know it 's there .
 The curator says they average 11 visitors a day !
 It 's a constituency matter .
 Nothing to do with Whitehall . What 's your interest ?
 - A question of principle .
 - Principle ?
 What you used to tell me politics was about .
 - What principle ?
 - The principle of taking money away from the arts and putting it into football .
 A football club is a commercial operation .
 There 's no cause for subsidy if it runs out of money . - Why not ? - Why not ?
 Yes .
 There 's no difference between subsidising football and art .
 Except more people are interested in football .
 - Our cultural heritage has to be preserved . - For whom ?
 For people like you , you mean , the educated middle classes .
 Why should others subsidise the pleasures of the middle- class few ?
 Theatre , opera , ballet !
 - Subsidising art is a middle- class rip- off .
 - Oh , Minister , how can you say such a thing ?
 Subsidy is about education , preserving the pinnacles of our civilisation .
 - Or hadn 't you noticed ?
 - Don 't patronise me .
 I believe in education .
 I 'm a graduate of the London School of Economics , remember .
 I 'm glad to learn that even the LSE is not totally opposed to education .
 Nothing wrong with subsidising sport . Sport is educational .
 We have sex education too .
 Should we subsidise sex ?
 Could we ?


 Let us choose what we subsidise by the extent of popular demand . - Nothing wrong with that .
 It 's democratic . - It 's the thin end of the wedge !
 What would happen to the Royal Opera House , the very summit of our cultural achievement ?
 Very good case in point .
 What do they do ?
 Mozart , Wagner , Verdi , Puccini .
 Germans and Italians , not our culture .
 Why should we subsidise the culture of the Axis powers ?
 Our European partners , Minister !
 The Royal Opera House gets nine- and- a- half million pounds of public money every year .
 And for what ?
 The public can 't afford Â£30 seats and if it could there aren 't enough of them .
 The vast majority of the audience consists of big business executives block- booked by the banks and oil companies and multinationals and people like you .
 The Royal Opera House is the establishment at play .
 Why should the working man pay for the gentry who can perfectly well afford their own seats ?
 Minister , I 'm quite frankly appalled . This is savagery , barbarism .
 That a Minister of the Crown should say such things , it 's the end of civilisation as we know it , - as well as being a gross distortion of the truth .
 - Distortion ?
 - Art cannot survive without public subsidy .
 - Did Shakespeare get a subsidy ?
 And films ?
 Films are art and educational .
 Why does the establishment ignore their subsidy ?
 Because people like you prefer opera .
 We should subsidise relevant art like films that the man in the street can enjoy .
 Precisely !
 They are commercial .

 Now , excuse me , I have to go early .
 I cannot continue with this appalling discussion . - Where are you going ?
 - Nowhere . Well , I 'm sorry .

 We must talk this through . I can 't .
 I have to dress .
 Dress ?
 Where are you going ?


 Since you insist , I am going to the Royal Opera House .
 Are you really ?

 Gala night , is it ?
 - Yes , it is , since you ask .
 - Lots of Permanent Secretaries going ?
 Some , no doubt .
 - Off you go , then .
 - Thank you .
 I don 't want to make you late for your works ' outing !
 That 's what it is , isn 't it ? What 's on tonight ?
 The Flying Dutchman .
 Another of our European partners !
 - G& T , lan ?
 - Thanks .
 Two G& Ts , please , large ones .
 And some of those smoked salmon sandwiches you have . Thank you very much .
 - So , how 's the environment ?
 - Bit smoky , isn 't it ?

 Oh , you mean my department ?
 Chaos , as usual .
 - What , the Secretary of State is trying to run it ?
 - I could cope with that .
 One of the junior ministers is trying to help him .
 Oh , Lord .
 Who ?
 - Giles Freeman , the Parli Sec .
 - Oh , Lord , him ?
 - Anyhow , what do you want to talk about ?
 - A planning enquiry .
 Important we get the right result .
 My planning inspectors are absolutely independent .
 - Absolutely .
 - No undue influence .
 No , no , I wouldn 't suggest it .
 But if it 's a question of giving certain informal guidelines ...
 - Putting the enquiry into perspective .
 - Yes , indeed .
 Explaining the background to facilitate an appreciation of the issues and implications .
 - That would be quite proper .
 - Splendid . - Ah .
 - Thank you very much .

 Er , right .
 Thank you very much .
 Cheers .
 So what do you want me to fix ?

 It 's an art gallery in the West Midlands .
 Proposed demolition of a Grade II listed building . - I 'm sure we can arrange that .
 Only too happy . - Splendid .
 We 're knocking them down all over the place .
 No , no , the proposal has to be rejected .
 Really ? Why ?
 If it goes through , they 'll use the proceeds to save the local football club from bankruptcy .

 - Humphrey ...
 - I know .
 If once you allow the principle of money being taken from the arts and given to ordinary people ... ... to enjoy themselves !

 - I agree .
 - Where will it end ? Exactly .


 - Where did this appalling idea come from ?
 - My lord and master .
 He 's getting very het up over the sweaty masses .
 - Didn 't you stop him ?
 What were you thinking of ?
 - It 's not me .
 It 's his constituency .
 Apparently he put it to a group of councillors last Saturday and they jumped at it .
 I 've always said we shouldn 't let him out at weekends !
 He only causes trouble .
 You realise where this could lead ?
 Today a Midlands art gallery goes to support the local football club , tomorrow the Royal Opera House grant goes to modernise Wembley Stadium .
 My point exactly .
 So I can trust you to keep an eye on the planning enquiry ?
 - Well , I can 't influence the inspector ...
 - 'Course not .
 But I 'll put someone on it who 's overdue for promotion .
 Good .
 You 'll give him a thorough briefing , won 't you ?
 Oh , I 'm sure he will see the real issue .
 Civilisation versus barbarism .
 We can 't have arts money going to popular sport . It 's simply subsidising self- indulgence .
 Exactly .

 Minister , before we go over today 's diary , there 's something I 'd like to suggest , if I may be so bold .
 - Be as bold as you like .
 - Well , I feel , and I say this with respect , you shouldn 't get too involved with this football club affair .
 That is bold , isn 't it ? It 's a constituency matter .
 Better for me to be " bold " than you to be stumped , Minister !
 Very droll .
 It 's axiomatic in Whitehall that even an MP , let alone a minister , should never take part in a planning enquiry in his own constituency .
 - Why not ?
 - Because of finely- balanced local issues .
 You 'll offend as many constituents as you 'll please .
 It 's especially dangerous if there 's a quango in the wings . No . Issues aren 't finely- balanced .
 Everyone 's on the same side , except a few wet , long- haired scruffy art lovers !

 We 'll take a look at your diary for this morning . Oh , fine .
 10 . 15 , Secretary General of the Arts Council , the biggest quango of all .
 10 . 45 , Historic Monuments Association , 11 . 00 , The National Trust .
 11 . 15 , Country Landowners Association , 11 . 30 , Council for Protection of Rural England ...
 - Rural England ?
 - There 's quite a lot of it out there !
 - Why are all these people coming to see me ?
 - The art gallery , Minister .
 It 's the arts and architecture mafia .
 - 11 . 45 , the Country Crafts and Folklore Council . - Who are they ?
 The raffia mafia .

 Influential people coming out of the woodwork .
 There 'll be letters in The Times , hostile articles in the Sundays , you 'll be called a vandal .
 They 'll orchestrate opposition in your constituency . Why did you put them in my diary ?
 I didn 't ask you to .
 What were you thinking ?
 - I was thinking of Sir Humphrey .
 He asked me to . - No .
 I 'm going to support this excellent scheme , come what may .

 As you will . May I just have your approval for this local government allowances amendment ?

 It 's a statutory instrument to go before the House .
 As Minister for Local Government , you need to authorise that revised paragraph 5 ,
 Number 2 regulation 1971 shall come into operation on March 18th , revoking regulation 7 of the local government allowances amendment regulations 1954b .
 What the hell 's all that mean ?
 There is an explanatory note .
 " These regulations make provision
 " for prescribing allowances payable to members of local authorities .
 " Explanatory note , regulation 3 of the local government allowances amendment ( 1971 )
 " ( the 1971 regulations )
 " Substituted a new regulation for regulation 3 of the 1954 regulations .
 " Regulation 3 of the local government allowances amendment regulations 1972 ,
 " ( the 1972 regulations ) further made amends regulation 3 of the 1954 regulations
 " by increasing the maximum rates of attendance and financial loss allowances . "
 - I haven 't the faintest ...
 - " Regulation 7 , 1982 ,
 " revoked both regulations 3 and 5 of the 1971 regulations ,
 " regulation 5 being a regulation revoking earlier spent regulations , " with effect from 1st April next .
 " These regulations preserve regulations 3 and 5 of the 1971 regulations
 " by revoking regulation 7 of the 1972 regulations . "
 That 's an explanatory note ?
 Yes , I think that 's all quite clear .
 Why must I listen to this piddling gobbledegook ?

 I thought it would be an opportune moment for you to ensure that as a result of your ministerial efforts , local councillors will get more for attending meetings .
 - Oh , is that what it means ? - Yes . Excellent .
 It is , as you say , opportune .
 - And may I make one further small suggestion ?
 - Be my guest .
 Sir Humphrey had a word with Sir lan Whitworth last night .
 - Lan Whitworth !
 - The Corn Exchange is a listed building , so one of his planning inspectors will conduct the enquiry .
 Sir Humphrey and Sir lan will give him some informal guidelines . How do you mean , " informal guidelines " ?
 Guidelines are perfectly proper .
 Everyone has guidelines for their work .
 I thought planning inspectors were impartial ?
 Oh , really , Minister !
 So they are .
 Railway trains are impartial too .
 But if you lay down the lines for them , that 's the way they go !
 - But that 's not fair !
 - It 's politics , Minister . What has Sir Humphrey got to do with politics ?
 He 's a civil servant .
 I 'm the one in politics !
 Yes , Minister , indeed you are !
 How do they intend to put pressure on this planning inspector ?
 Planning inspectors have an independent hierarchy .
 A vulnerable one is one anxious for promotion .
 How are planning inspectors chosen for an enquiry ? Could a minister interfere ?
 - Ministers are our lords and masters .
 - Good .
 The Parli Sec at the Department of the Environment is an old friend , Giles Freeman .
 Well , if Mr Freeman could arrange for an inspector who didn 't care about promotion , if , for instance , he 's about to retire , he 'll probably reach a verdict favouring the community rather than the department .


 Good !
 Get me Giles on the phone , would you ?
 His Private Secretary says he can meet you in the lobby after the vote this evening .

 Bernard , have you ever thought of going into politics ?

 - Oh , no , Minister .
 - Why not ?
 - I once looked it up in my thesaurus .
 - What did it say ?
 Manipulation , intrigue , wire- pulling , evasion , graft , rabble- rousing ...
 I 'd prefer to leave that to our lords and masters . I don 't think I have the necessary qualities .

 Don 't underestimate yourself , Bernard !
 Now it seems Hacker has got at Giles Freeman , the Parli Sec in my department , who insisted on appointing a different planning inspector to the one I chose !
 One who 'd be sympathetic to Hacker 's scheme . - This is rather worrying .
 - Worrying ? It 's desperate !
 There 's now every danger that the planning inspector could make up his own mind !
 There 's likely to be huge local support for the scheme . - But how can I help ?
 - I hoped you 'd have some ideas , Arnold .
 Wait a minute !
 I 've thought of something .
 When the departmental reorganisation occurs next week ... ... you could make Hacker Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts !
 - But isn 't he a complete philistine ? - Yes .
 But then the Industry Secretary is the idlest man in town .
 The Education Secretary is illiterate !
 The Employment Secretary is unemployable ! Quite .
 That 's good thinking , Humphrey .
 Hacker can hardly start out as Cabinet Minister for the arts by closing down an art gallery .
 - Exactly .
 - But it 's not a reshuffle , is it ?
 No , I simply meant reorganise .
 Move the arts and telecommunications into the purview of the DAA .
 Arts and television together ?
 What have they got to do with each other ?
 They 're complete opposites .
 Wouldn 't we be creating a monster department ?
 You 've already got local government as well .
 - Arts and local government go well together .
 - How so ?
 Well , the art of jiggery- pokery !
 You only just thought of this here and now , did you ?
 - Yes , why ?
 - Bit of an artist yourself , aren 't you ?
 Oh , Arnold !

 - Anything more , Bernard ? - Sir Humphrey wants a word before your meeting about Aston Wanderers .

 But I 'm unshakeable on that !
 It 's no good , Humphrey , my mind is made up .
 You might be interested in a new development , the government reshuffle .
 - You said it was just a reorganisation . - Not JUST a reorganisation .
 A reorganisation .

 I 'm delighted to tell you that it has brought us , brought YOU , new honour and importance .
 In addition to existing responsibilities , you will be Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts .
 I say , that 's rather good , isn 't it ! Hold on , how do you know before I do ?
 I just happened to be with the Cabinet Secretary shortly after the decision was taken .
 I see .
 Cabinet Minister with responsibility for the arts !
 - Well , well , well !
 - Yes , indeed . Anything more ?
 I 'm about to start a meeting .
 Oh , the meeting , yes .
 I do hope you 've considered the implications of your new appointment on the subject .
 - Rescuing a football club ?
 - No , no .
 I was wondering how it would look if as Minister responsible for the arts , your first act was to knock down an art gallery .

 It 's quite a decent little art gallery ...

 - Exactly .
 - Interesting building . - Grade II listed .
 - Minister , your meeting ...

 Oh , my God !
 What am I going to say ?
 - Councillors Wilkinson , Noble and Green .
 - Brian , good to see you .
 Pete ...
 Doug .
 Sir Humphrey Appleby , my Permanent Secretary .
 You mean he 's only a temp !

 It 's going great , Jim .
 We 've got all the political parties with us and the County Council .
 All we need is your approval for using the sale of the art gallery as a loan to the club .
 Well , I 'm afraid there 's a snag . - You said there weren 't any !
 - Well , there is .
 Well , it 's just that ...
 Well ...
 It appears ...
 Well , it seems ...

 Well , I should say it has emerged ...

 Sir Humphrey can explain better than me .
 It can 't be done , gentlemen . Er , the art gallery is ... It 's a trust .
 - Terms of the original bequest .
 - Yes , it 's a trust .
 We shall have to knock something else down !
 School , church , hospital ... There 's bound to be something !
 I can 't believe this .
 So I have to tell people back home you 've gone back on your word ?
 - It was your own idea !
 - It 's not me , it 's the law .
 Why didn 't you find out till now ?
 - Well ...
 - A- hem .

 Let me be absolutely frank with you .
 The truth is , it would be possible to push this through , just possible , - but it would take an awful long time .
 - OK , we 've spent enough .
 Trouble is , something else would have to go by the board .
 The thing that 's taking my time at the moment is forcing through councillors ' expenses and attendance allowances .
 I can 't put my personal weight behind both schemes .
 I suppose I could forget about the increased allowances for councillors and concentrate on the legal obstacles , the sale of the art gallery .
 - Tricky things , legal obstacles . - This is a particularly tricky one .
 At the end of the day , you might still fail .

 - Every possibility .
 - If that 's the way it is ... there 's a chance we might want to close Edgehill primary at the end of the year ...
 That site would fetch a couple of million , give or take .
 Well , there it is , then . No ill feelings to you . Good .
 And you 'll explain locally that we can 't overcome the legal obstacles ?
 ' Course we will .
 Carry on with the good work !

 Oh , Minister , a work of art .
 - If you 'll excuse me , I have to dress . - Another works ' outing ?


 - Er , Humphrey ... - Minister ?
 - As Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts ...
 - Hmm ?
 ... could I come too ?
 Yes , Minister ! http : // episode- heaven . rt . hu
