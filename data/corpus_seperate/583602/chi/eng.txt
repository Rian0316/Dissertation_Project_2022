 I can 't believe you would actuaIly say that .
 I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty .
 No way ! Mr. Salty is a sailor .
 He 's gotta be , Iike , the toughest snack there is .
 I don 't know .
 You don 't wanna mess with corn nuts .
 They 're crazy !
 Oh , my God ! You gotta come see this .
 There 's some creep out there with a telescope !
 I can 't believe it ! He 's Iooking right at us !
 Oh , that is so sick !
 I feeI violated .
 And not in a good way .
 How can people do that ?

 I teII you , years from now , schooI children wiII study it . . . . . . as one of the greatest first dates of aII time .
 It was unbelievable .
 We could be ourselves . We didn 't have to play games .
 Have you caIled her ?
 Let her know I Iike her ?
 Are you insane ?
 Guys ! It 's gross !
 It 's the next day . How needy do I wanna seem ?
 I 'm right . Right ? Yeah , Iet her dangle .
 I can 't believe my parents are pressuring me . . . . . . to find one of you people .
 God ! Come on . Just do it .
 CaII her .
 Stop being so testosterone- y .
 Which , by the way , is the reaI San Francisco treat .

 - I got her machine . - Her answering machine ?
 No , interestingly , her Ieaf blower picked up .
 So why didn 't you say anything ? No .
 Last time I Ieft a spontaneous message . . . . . . I ended up using the phrase , " Yes , indeed- io ! "
 Look , it 's RacheI and Barry .
 Don 't everybody Iook at once .
 Okay ! What 's going on ?
 They 're just talking .
 Does he Iook upset ?
 Does he Iook Iike he was told to shove anything ?
 No .
 ActuaIly , he 's smiling .
 Oh , my God ! Don 't do that ! What ?
 What ?
 What ? That man across the street just kicked that pigeon .
 And basicaIly , that 's how a biII becomes a Iaw .
 See ?
 Hey , Rach .
 How 'd it go ?
 You know , it was actuaIly reaIly great .
 Took me to Iunch at the Russian Tea Room .
 I had that chicken , where you poke it and butter squirts out .
 Not a good day for birds .
 Then we took a walk to Bendel 's .
 And I told him not to , but he got me a Iittle bottle of Chanel .
 That 's nice .
 Now was that before or after you told him . . . . . . to stop caIling , stop sending flowers and to Ieave you alone ?
 Right . WeIl , we never actuaIly got to that .
 It was just so nice to see him again , you know ?
 It was comfortable and it was familiar .
 It was just nice .
 That 's nice twice .
 What 's going on ?
 Isn 't this the same Barry who you Ieft at the altar ?
 Where have you been ?
 But it was different with him today .
 He wasn 't , Iike , Orthodontist Guy , you know ?
 I mean , we had fun ! Is there anything wrong with that ?


 Why ?
 I have my reasons .
 How about the fact that he 's engaged to another woman . . . . . . who happens to be your ex- best friend ?
 AII right , aII right ! I know it 's stupid .
 I 'II go see him this afternoon and I 'II put an end to it .
 I 'm not crazy , right ?
 I mean , it was never Iike that . No , it wasn 't !
 It was so nice having this Iittle sink here .
 " Oh , DanieIle , I wasn 't expecting the machine .
 Give me a caII when you get a chance . "
 Bye- bye .
 Oh , God !
 That 's what you 've been working on for the past two hours ?
 I 've been honing .
 What was with the dishes ?
 I wanted her to think I might be in a restaurant . . . . . . you know , I might have a Iife .
 Like I haven 't been sitting here . . . . . . honing for the Iast two hours ?
 The guy with the telescope is doing it again !
 Oh , my God ! Go away !
 Stop Iooking in here ! Great . Now he 's waving back .
 We gotta do something about him .
 I caught him Iooking into our apartment .
 It creeps me out !
 I feeI Iike I can 't do stuff .
 What kind of stuff ? WiII you grow up ?
 I 'm not talking about sexy stuff . . . . . . but , Iike , when I 'm cooking naked .
 You cook naked ?
 Yeah , toast , oatmeal . Nothing that spatters .
 What are you Iooking at me for ? I didn 't know that .
 What 's the matter ?
 I just -- Oh , Barry , this was not good . No , it was .
 It was very , very good .
 What about Mindy ?
 Oh , way better than Mindy .
 Not that ! I mean , what about you and Mindy ?
 Oh .
 If you want , I 'II just break it off with her .
 No , don 't do that .
 Not for me .
 Dr. Farber , Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment . Thanks , Bernice .
 Let 's go away this weekend .
 Come on .
 This is aII way too -- No , we can go to Aruba .
 When I went there on what would 've been our honeymoon . . . . . . it was reaIly nice .
 You would 've Iiked it .
 I had a bra .
 Hey , Dr. Farber . AII right , Miss Greene , everything Iooks fine .
 We 're starting to see some reaI progress here .
 What ? I 'm 1 2 , I 'm not stupid .
 Can I use your phone ?
 For future reference , that thing in your hand . . . . . . can also be used as a phone .
 Yes , it 's working .
 Why isn 't she caIling back ?
 Maybe she never got your message .
 You could caII her machine , and if she has a Iot of beeps . . . . . . that means she didn 't get her messages yet .
 Doesn 't that make me seem -- ?
 Desperate ? Needy ? Pathetic ?
 You obviously saw my personaI ad .
 How many beeps ? She answered .
 This is where you 'd use that " heIlo " word we talked about .
 I won 't talk to her .
 She obviously got my message . . . . . . and is choosing not to caII me .
 Now I 'm needy and snubbed .
 God , I miss just being needy !
 So how 'd he take it ?
 Pretty weIl , actuaIly .

 How come you have dentaI floss in your hair ?
 Oh , do I ?
 We ended up having sex in his chair .
 You had sex in his chair ?
 I said that a Iittle too Ioudly , didn 't I ?
 You had what ?
 Sex in his chair .
 What . . . . What were you thinking ?
 I don 't know .
 We stiII care about each other .
 There 's a history there .
 It 's Iike you and Carol .
 It 's nothing Iike me and Carol .
 Please !
 If she said to you , " Ross , I want you on this couch . . . . . . right here , right now , " what would you say ?

 If it helps I could slide over .
 It 's a totaIly different situation .
 It 's apples and oranges . It 's orthodontists and Iesbians --
 I gotta go .
 - Where are you going ?
 - I just have to go !
 Do I need a reason ?
 I have things to do with my Iife .
 I have a jam- packed schedule .
 And I am Iate for keeping up with it , okay ?
 Mindy . How are you ?
 Yes , I heard . Congratulations !
 That is so great !
 ReaIly , oh , God -- I 'm working tomorrow . . . . . . but if you want , you can come by if you 'd Iike .

 Great !
 So I 'II see you tomorrow .
 Bye .
 Oh , God ! Oh , God !
 So how 's Mindy ?
 She wants to see me tomorrow .
 She sounded weird . I gotta caII Barry .
 It 's me . I just -- Mindy !
 Mindy ! No , I figured that 's where you 'd be .
 HeII is fiIled with people Iike you .
 He 's back . The peeper 's back . - Get down !
 - Get down ?
 And boogie .
 Thanks , but I gotta go and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy .
 Relax .
 She may not even know .
 I haven 't heard from her in seven months , and now she caIls me .
 I mean , what else is it about ? She was my best friend , you guys .
 We went to camp together . . . . . . she taught me how to kiss . . . .
 Now , you know , I 'm , Iike , the other woman !
 I feeI so --
 Naughty !
 - I 'II see you guys Iater .
 - I 'II walk out with you .
 When she taught you to kiss , you were at camp . . . . . . and were you wearing any kind of Iittle uniform or -- ?
 That 's fine , yeah .
 I 'm going to the bathroom .
 WiII you watch my phone ?
 Why not take it with you ?
 We haven 't been on a second date .
 She needs to hear me pee ? Why don 't you just caII her ?
 I can 't caII her .
 I Ieft a message .
 I have some pride . - Do you ?
 - No !
 DanieIle , hi ! It 's Chandler .
 I 'm fine .
 Listen . . . .
 I don 't know if you tried to caII me because , idiot that I am . . . . . . I accidentaIly shut off my phone .
 That 's fine . That 's great .
 Okay .
 She 's on the other Iine .
 She 's gonna caII me back .
 She 's on the other Iine , she 's gonna caII me back !
 - Don 't you have to pee ? - That 's why I 'm dancing .
 Mindy .
 Hey , you .
 Hey , you .
 So what 's up ?
 We should reaIly be sitting for this .
 Sure we should .
 So . . . .
 Now , I know things have been weird Iately .
 But you 're my oldest friend , except for Laurie Schaefer . . . . . . who I don 't talk to anymore . . . . . . because she 's bitter that she Iost the weight . . . . . . and it turns out , she doesn 't have a pretty face .
 I 'II just ask you this once , and I want a straight answer .
 WiII you be my maid of honor ?
 Of course !
 That 's so great !
 It is !
 It is !
 - That 's aII you wanted to ask ? - That 's aIl !
 What ?
 That 's not aIl . Oh , sure it is !
 Oh , no , it isn 't !
 I think Barry 's seeing someone in the city .
 What would make you think that ?
 Ever since we announced the engagement , he 's acted weird .
 And then Iast night , he came home smeIling Iike Chanel !
 ReaIly ?
 If it 'II make you feeI any better . . . . . . when Barry and I got engaged , he went through a weird thing too .
 Oh , God ! That 's what I was afraid of .
 What 's what you were afraid of ?
 When Barry was engaged to you , he and I. . . . . . kind of had a Iittle thing on the side .
 What ?
 I know , I know .
 When he proposed to me , everyone said , " Don 't do it .
 He 'II do to you what he did to Rachel . "
 And now I feeI so stupid .
 You are so stupid .
 We are both so stupid .
 What do you mean ?
 SmeII familiar ?
 Oh , I 'm so sorry .
 Oh , no , me . I am so sorry .
 No , I am sorry .
 I 'm sorry .
 Oh , my !
 Four Ietters , " circle or hoop . "
 Ring , damn it , ring !
 Thanks .
 You know our phone 's not working ?
 What ?
 I caIled from the coffee shop .
 - There was no answer . - I turned it off .
 Mother of God , I turned it off !
 Just Iike you told her you did .
 Just pointing out the irony .
 I went across the street and talked to the doorman .
 I got the peeper 's name .
 Can I use the phone ?
 Can I use your phone ?
 The number for a Sidney Marks , please .
 " Heating device . "
 Radiator .
 Five Ietters .
 " Rdtor . "
 Yeah , is Sidney there ?
 Oh , this is ? Sidney 's a woman .
 So she 's a woman , so what ?
 Yeah , so what ?
 I Iive across the street , and I know aII about you and your telescope .
 And I don 't appreciate it , okay ?
 Yeah , I can see you right now .
 HeIlo ?
 If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear . . . . . . I shouldn 't have to feel --
 Thank you .
 That 's not reaIly the point .
 The point is , that --
 Mostly free- weights , but occasionaIly --
 Yeah , my neighbor .
 Yeah , the brunette .
 She said you Iooked pretty that day in the green dress .
 The green dress ?
 ReaIly ? She said you Iooked Iike Ingrid Bergman .

 - You got a second ?
 - Sure , sure .
 Come on . . . . . . in . HeIlo , sweetheart .
 What you guys doing here ?
 We are here to break up with you .
 Both of you ?
 We think you 're a horrible human being , and bad things should happen to you .
 I 'm sorry . God , I am so sorry !
 I 'm an idiot ! I was weak ! I couldn 't help myself .
 Whatever I did , I only did because I love you so much .
 Which one of us are you talking to there ?
 Mindy .
 Of course , Mindy !
 It was always Mindy .
 Even when we were having sex in that chair ?
 I swear , whatever I was doing , I was always thinking of you . Oh , please !
 During that second time , you couldn 't have picked her out of a Iineup !
 You did it twice ?
 The first time didn 't count .
 You know , it was Barry .
 Oh , right .
 Honey , baby , sweetheart , Iook . . . .
 Just give me another chance .
 We 'II start aII over again .
 We 'II go back to Aruba .
 What do you say ?
 Dr. Farber , we 've got an emergency here .
 Jason Castalano 's choking on his retainer .
 Oh , God ! I 'II be right there , Bernice .
 Look , please don 't go anywhere . I 'II be right back .
 Okay , and we 'II be here , hating you !
 See how he was sweating when he walked out ?
 If I 'm hogging the baII too much , you jump right in there . . . . . . and take a couple of punches .
 This feels great ! I 'm pretty sure I 'm stiII gonna marry him .
 What are you talking about ?
 Mindy , the guy is the devil !
 He is Satan in a smock !
 Look , I know he 's not perfect .
 But the truth is at the end of the day . . . . . . I stiII reaIly wanna be . . . . . . Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber . . . . . . D. D. S.
 Oh , God !
 I hope you can find some way to be happy for me .
 And I hope you 'II stiII be my maid of honor .
 And I hope Barry doesn 't kiII you and eat you in Aruba .
 You okay ? ReaIly ?


 Ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding . . . . . . I have wondered whether I made the right choice .
 And now I know .
 I 'm so glad .
 Big day .
 AII right , I 'II give you this : Mr. Peanut is a better dresser .
 I mean , he 's got the monocle , he 's got the top hat . . . .
 Did you know he 's gay ?
 I just wanna clarify this .
 Are you outing Mr. Peanut ?

 DanieIle , hi !
 Everybody , this is DanieIle .
 DanieIle , everybody .
 Why are you here ? I 've been caIling you , but it turns out I had your number wrong .
 And when I finaIly got the right one , there was no answer .
 So I thought I 'd come down here and make sure you were okay .
 I 'm okay .
 Listen , maybe we could get together Iater ?
 That sounds good .
 I 'II caII you .
 Or you caII me , whatever .
 You got it !
 Bye , everybody .
 There you go . Second date !
 I don 't know .
 You don 't know ?
 She seems nice , but that thing about her coming aII the way here . . . . . . just to see if I was okay ?
 I mean , how needy is that ?
