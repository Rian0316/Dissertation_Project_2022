 Hello , Mr. Hendricks .
 Morning , Ruby . Would you like some breakfast ?
 - You don 't have any nut milk ?
 - Mm- mm .
 Well , if I eat anything else before 10 : 00 a . m . , I 'll vom . So , no , thanks .
 I am very glad you feel comfortable staying the night with Otis .
 I want you both to feel that this is a safe space to explore your relationship .
 Oh , we 're just having casual sex . I would never date him . [ scoffs ]
 [ Jean farts ] Oh , I 'm so sorry . I was never this gassy with Otis .
 Doesn 't it feel kind of gross having something growing inside you ?
 No . Feels quite natural .
 That would make me claustrophobic .
 Well , that 's interesting . Why would you think that ?
 What if the father turns out to be a dickhead ?
 Then I have to see him until the day I die just because he impregnated me .

 Oh yeah . Otis was a bit babyish , so I changed it . [ chuckles ]
 Okay , let 's go .
 - So you 're getting back together ? - No .
 We 're gonna co- parent .

 May I ask what made you break off the relationship before ?
 Oh , it was a number of things .
 Jean kissed her ex- husband .

 I made a mistake that I apologized for .
 I found the sudden presence of a partner in my life , in my space , every day , difficult .
 Like , uh , my coins ... Loose change ... - ... everywhere . - ... everywhere .
 Annoying .
 - Mm- hmm .
 - Mm- hmm .
 [ Jean ] So he ended things .
 A decision that I completely respect .
 [ therapist ] Is it what you wanted ?
 No . I wanted to try again .
 Is that why you decided to keep this baby ?
 - No . Absolutely not . - No .
 [ Jean ] I had discovered I was pregnant quite late on .
 I really didn 't know what I was going to do .

 To be honest ,
 I don 't think I 'm ready to let go of being a full- time mum .
 I think I 'm good at it .
 And also , well , this may sound stupid , but
 I 'm 48 , and he 's had a vasectomy , so it just seemed ...
 Fated ?
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Yeah .
 Anyway ...
 Being an older parent is intimidating .
 I 've found that , and so ...
 I want Jakob to be involved in any way that he can .
 [ therapist ] Well ,
 I think you both still care about each other , but you weren 't dating for very long beforehand , so in some ways , you 're still strangers .
 You haven 't had time to build up that foundation of trust , which you are going to need to be co- parents .
 I 'm gonna give you some homework to help you move forwards .

 Okay . Maybe tomorrow ?
 Mm , yeah . Ooh , oh , tomorrow !
 What was that about ? I 'm seeing Elsie 's new foster family tonight .
 I know , I know , but he keeps trying to kiss and cuddle me .
 He doesn 't mean to put pressure on me , but sometimes he gets this hungry look in his eyes , and I just wanna scream , [ shouts ]
 " No , Steve , I don 't wanna have sex ! "
 [ laughter ]
 I used to really like sex , and I still wank a lot when I 'm on my own , but I don 't know .
 I just feel safer when I 'm by myself .
 How long has this been going on for ?
 Since the bus .
 You might need to talk to someone professional , Aimes .
 Do you think I can find someone like Otis 's mum ? She seemed nice .
 Yeah .
 [ Maeve ] Hi , Otis . Can I talk to you for a sec ?
 [ clears throat ] Ruby picked this out for me .
 I didn 't ask , but cool .
 We 're still casual , but I wanted to try something new .
 Casual doesn 't seem like you .
 Anyway , Aimee is still struggling after last term , and I 'm ...
 I 'm worried about her . She needs to talk to someone .
 I wondered maybe if she could talk to your mum ?
 - Sorry if it 's weird to ask . - No !
 No , Maeve , of course .
 - Really ? - Yeah , I 'll ... I 'll chat to her .
 Thanks .
 What did you mean , " Casual doesn 't seem like me " ?
 I don 't know , just the whole no- feelings thing .
 You used to care a lot .
 Things are easier when you don 't care .
 Nobody gets hurt .

 Hello . We need to talk , New Kid .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 Would you like some tea ?
 No , I don 't want any tea .
 I want you to stop talking shit to my boyfriend .
 Did you and Eric have a fight ?
 Yes .
 No .
 Sort of .
 You told him I 'm not properly gay , and now he 's angry because he thinks I don 't wanna have sex with him .
 I never said you 're not " properly gay . "
 I said I want Eric to be careful because you 've hurt him in the past , and I 'm worried .
 You should be talking to him about this , not me .
 Tried talking . Doesn 't come out right .
 What do you mean ?
 I don 't know how to say what I 'm thinking .
 All the words are there in my head .
 I just don 't know how to say the thing that I want to say .
 The more I think about it , the worse it gets .
 People are just looking at me , waiting for me to say something , so ...
 So I don 't say anything at all .
 People think I 'm scary or stupid .
 Why do you find it so hard ?
 I didn 't grow up in a naked family .
 What 's a naked family ?
 You know , those families where everyone walks around naked , talking about how they feel .
 Like you and your mum . Bet you 're naked all the time .
 We are not .
 Do you think your family ...
 I 'm not here to do your weird therapy thing .
 I just want you to stop talking about me to Eric . It 's none of your business .
 I will stay out of it .
 [ sighs ]
 Sometimes , it helps to write down what you want to say first .
 I 'm not good at writing .
 Or you can ask the other person to close their eyes whilst you talk to them .
 Sounds stupid .
 What I 'm saying is , it might help you think more clearly about what you want to say if you don 't feel observed .
 It 's just a suggestion .
 I 'm going now .
 You should wear your normal clothes again .
 That top makes your neck look very long .
 [ Jean exhales deeply ]
 - [ both panting ] - Oh , that was a bad idea .
 Yeah .
 [ exhales ]
 Probably was .
 [ both panting ]
 Well , Dr. Cutton is right .
 We do care about each other , and that can be confusing .
 But we 're adults , and ...
 We won 't let that happen again .
 I think we more than care for each other .
 What are you saying ?
 I think we should be a family .
 [ both panting ]
 But she also said that we barely know each other .
 I don 't care what the therapist said .
 I think we should be a family , Jean .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ music fades ]
 Are you still at school , Maeve ?
 Mm- hmm .
 I 'm in my final year .
 Well done , you . That 's a big achievement .
 Why ? Because Mum 's a junkie ?
 No , it 's a big achievement for anyone .
 [ Maeve ]
 Mm- hmm .
 And I understand you don 't have a lot of support at home .
 Are you in some kind of positivity cult ?
 No .
 It helps when the social workers come round .
 Uh- huh .
 You 've got a lot of books .
 [ Anna ] Yes , I teach literature part- time .
 You can never be lonely with the company of a good book .
 You can borrow that if you like .
 No , thanks .

 She should be here now . Does she run late often ?
 Sorry . My mum 's coming here ?
 Yeah , this is a family visit . - [ doorbell rings ] - I assumed you two would 've spoken .

 Rude ? I 'll tell you what 's rude . Calling the police on your own mother .
 That 's rude . Okay .
 I think I 'm gonna come back another day .
 Yeah , you do that . Nobody wants you here . Bye- bye .
 Bye .
 - I love you so much ! [ kisses ] - [ door opens , closes ]

 Mm .

 - Hi . - [ Joe snoring ]
 [ door closes ]
 Ah , don 't worry about him . He 's out like a light .
 - [ TV plays indistinctly ] - [ Joe continues snoring ]
 [ Maeve sighs ]
 How was Elsie 's new place ?
 I 'm not sure about the foster lady . She 's a bit of a know- it- all , but ...
 It was nice .
 Until my mum turned up and told me to get out , which was less nice .
 Shit .
 Yeah , it was pretty shit .
 Do you want a hug ? Mine are notoriously terrible , but still .
 Yeah , all right .
 - I 'm sure your mum will ... - No .
 [ shushes ]
 Let 's not talk about it . It is what it is .
 [ Joe snores , groans ]
 He 's disgusting .
 - Yeah . - [ Joe snorts ]
 - [ chuckles ] - I 'm related to that .
 [ inhales deeply ]
 [ TV continues indistinctly ]
 Wait .
 - Sorry . - I ...
 I 've gotta tell you something .
 Okay .
 The night that your mum and Elsie went with the police , that Otis guy came , and I didn 't tell you .
 Okay .
 He said that he wanted to talk to you and that he left a message on your phone , but you 'd ... you 'd gone to the shops .
 And ...
 I listened to the message .
 And I deleted it .
 Okay .
 What did the message say ?
 Um ...
 Something about him still having feelings for you and that he felt like he 'd messed things up .
 He said ,
 " Call me back if it wasn 't too late . "
 Can you say something , please ?
 Elsie left weeks ago .
 I ... I didn 't know how to tell you .
 It 's not an excuse , but ...
 I was angry at all the shit that you dealt with .
 I don 't think Otis understands it at all .
 The way that he treated you at that party .
 He said that you were a selfish person , and you are the least selfish person I know .
 So you went into my private property . I 'm a dick , I know , but ... [ sighs ]
 ... I was doing it because I was trying to protect you .
 You 're right .
 Otis doesn 't understand me .
 But neither do you .
 Because if you did , you 'd know that I don 't trust anyone .
 But I trusted you , and that was special ...
 And you 've messed it up .
 People make mistakes .
 - Like your mum . She ... - Don 't talk to me about my mum .
 Can 't believe I thought you were different .
 [ emotional music playing ]

 [ rock clatters ]
 [ sucking air through teeth ]
 [ whispers ] Come on .
 What do you wanna talk to me about ?
 I , uh ...
 [ splutters ] I 've ...
 Adam , it 's late ...
 I 'm sorry .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 I wanna tell you how I feel , but I don 't want you to look at me .
 Okay .
 I ... don 't want to have sex with you .
 I want you to have sex with me .
 I don 't understand what you 're saying , Adam .
 [ sighs ]
 I want you to put your dick in me .
 That 's how I would like to do it .
 Can you turn around , please ?
 I would love to put my dick in you .
 [ " Can I Sleep in Your Brain " by Ezra Furman playing ]

 - Adam .
 - Hm ?
 I think you should go before my parents see you stayed the night .
 [ Eric chuckles ]
 [ song ends ]
 [ Beatrice ] He has to work .
 Yes , I know . He works very hard .
 Mm- hmm .
 Eric ! Come in here !
 Your grandma 's on the phone .
 - Coming !
 - [ Beatrice chuckles ]
 - Yes , I know . - Who 's got my highlighter ? Who 's got it ?
 Your cousin Shukpo is getting married .
 Your grandmother wants us all to go to Nigeria for the wedding . Ooh ! Oh !
 [ laughs ]
 What about school ?
 - You 'll only be gone a week . - Okay ...
 Remember , she doesn 't know anything about Adam .
 - She 's too frail for that . - [ whispers ] Okay .
 Hello , Grandma ! How are you ?

 Michael .
 Colin .
 I need somewhere to stay for a bit .
 Sure , man .
 [ chuckles , clears throat ]
 [ whimsical music continues ]
 No , no . Nope , nope , nope , nope .
 [ exhales sharply ]
 [ sighs ]
 Hello , darling !
 - Good morning . - Have a seat . I made eggs .
 [ Otis chuckles ]
 What 's going on ? Last time you made eggs was when Dad left .
 [ tuts , sighs ]
 Jakob and I have done some talking .
 - And ... - Mm- hmm . ... we think it would be best for the new baby and ...
 For us , and for everyone , really , that we try and make this work properly .
 As a family .
 Which means ?
 That I want Jakob and Ola to move in with us .
 I know that 's a lot to take in , and if it doesn 't feel right for you , we 'll find another way , but ...
 I think it could be good .
 Okay .
 That 's it ?
 If this is what you wanna do , Mum , then , yeah , I 'm fine with it .
 I mean , I 'm not gonna be living at home forever .
 Thank you for being so adult .
 [ car horn honking ]
 [ soft chuckle ]
 [ sighs ]
 Mum , do you think I 'm a casual- relationships kinda guy ?
 I think you 're the sort of person who wants meaningful connection .
 But I also think that it 's good for you to try different types of relationships .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 There 's a friend of mine at school .
 She was sexually assaulted last term and needs some help .
 I said I 'd ask if you 'd speak with her . It 's fine if you can 't .
 I 'd be honored to speak with her .
 Thanks , Mum .

 [ sighs in relief ]
 Um , hello !
 Why are you wearing your homeless clothes again ?
 Because these are my clothes , Ruby !
 I don 't wanna have to change who I am in order to hang out with you .
 But if you 're really that embarrassed of me , I guess we have to call it quits .
 [ scoffs ]
 People don 't call it with me .
 They don 't have to if you always keep things casual .
 I would like to get to know you better if you 'd let me .
 Why ?
 Because I think you 're an interesting person .
 I mean , you 're terrifying ...
 But interesting .
 Do you mean you want to be my boyfriend ?
 Yeah , I guess so .

 I think I can probably make people think this jacket is cool .


 Miss ? Yeah ?
 - Can I ask you something ? - Of course .
 Okay .
 Uh ...
 Mm ...
 I would like to be better at school , and ... and maybe ...
 Not be in the bottom set anymore .
 Can you help me do that , please ?
 Why are you turned around ?
 It makes me think better .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 Okay . [ clears throat ] Sure , Adam .
 I can try and help you .
 But you must commit yourself . I don 't want to waste my time .
 Thanks , miss .
 [ upbeat music playing ]
 Why is he not wearing purple ?
 I think we should dress how we want to from now on .
 Still cool and expensive , obviously .
 Shut the front door .
 It 's my new look . I call it " Pimp on Fire . "
 - You look great , Anwar . - You look like you were dressed by a bin .
 Maeve .
 Hey , I spoke to my mum , and she 'll talk to Aimee .
 Thanks , Otis . I appreciate that .
 [ chuckles ]
 And me and Ruby aren 't casual anymore . We 're official .
 [ Ruby ]
 Hmm .
 [ sighs ]
 Got you an appointment with Jean Milburn . - It 's a good start .
 - That 's great !
 Yeah .
 What if she thinks I 'm wobbly in the brain ?
 She won 't think that , Aimes .
 - So what 's the news with Isaac ? - [ tuts ] Changed my mind about that .
 - Why ? - Because you were right .
 Don 't need a boy when I 've got you .
 Maeve , why is your nose ring still in ?
 Because I forgot to take it out . Sorry .
 Okay , hand it over .
 - Now ? - Yes , now .
 And don 't make me ask again .
 Might start to think you 're not as smart as people say you are .
 Hey !
 [ snaps fingers ]
 - Jackson Marchetti has a crush ? - Reduce it .
 Jackson , I just saw the wall isn 't painted .
 Yes , I wanted to talk to you about that .
 As head boy , I 'd like to put my case forward for saving the Wall of Cock .
 It 's a piece of school history and a form of artistic expression that , in my opinion , shouldn 't be censored .
 What do you think , Vivienne ?
 I think the wall should be painted .
 It 's vulgar , immature , and doesn 't represent the school in the right way .
 - Yeah , but ... - I agree .
 Would you like Jackson 's job ?
 - Sure , absolutely , yes . - Wait , what ?
 Fantastic . You start today .
 This will give you lots more time to focus on your artistic pursuits .
