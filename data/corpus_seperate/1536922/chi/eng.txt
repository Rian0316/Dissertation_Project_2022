 00 : 00 : 01, 924 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 642 How much time do we have ?
 Uh , t- minus five hours , 37 minutes
 To onset of meteor shower . Okay , our position is 34 . 48 degrees north , 118 . 31 west .

 That means the azimuth
 Should be ... 168 . 22 degrees relative to magnetic north
 With an elevation of 49 . 93 .
 Anything yet ?
 Uh , we have a signal , but there 's no frame lock .
 Ha . How about now ?
 - We did it . We have the west coast feed of HBO .
 Big deal . Every time I watch that show
 All right , let 's see what 's on the east coast feed .

 Not a great movie , But look at that beautiful desert .
 ( sighs ) Too bad Sheldon couldn 't come with us .
 Oh it 's just not the same without him . ( all laughing )

 Sheldon 's log . stardate 63345 . 3 While my colleagues are off Observing the Leonid meteor shower ,
 I have remained behind to complete my paper On the decays of highly excited massive string states .
 Although my research is going well
 I do miss the warmth of human companionship .

 Hahaha .









 And good evening to you , Siam Palace .
 This is Sheldon Cooper . Yeah , I 'm going to be dining alone this evening ,
 So I 'll be reducing my usual order .
 I 'd like to start with one quarter Of the assorted appetizers plate
 And , uh , one half of the golden treasure for two .
 Oh , for heaven 's sake In the mid- 18th century ,
 King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire
 Amongst the colonial powers of Europe
 In order to preserve his throne .
 Surely , you , his cultural desendant , Can handle pad thai and dumplings .
 Penny ( screaming ) : Sheldon help !
 I need to go -- but you keep in mind That my sharply worded comments On yelp . Com recently took down a local muffin store .

 Penny . Penny .
 Penny . Come in ! Hurry !
 ( water running ) Penny ?
 I 'm back here .
 Penny .
 Penny . Penny .
 Oh , for god 's sakes , I 'm in the bathroom !
 Shall I come back at a better time ? Get in here !
 Hurry !
 Don 't you dare knock .

 Hello . I slipped in the shower ,
 And I think I dislocated my shoulder .
 Not surprising .
 You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers To allow for purchase on a surface
 With a low coefficient of static friction .
 What ?
 Tubs are slippery .
 I know . I slipped .
 I have a series of whimsical duck stickers
 On the bottom of my tub .
 Yeah , okay , whatever . Will you just turn the water off and help me up ?
 They 're holding umbrellas . ( groans ) what ?
 The ducks in my tub . Uh- huh .
 They 're whimsical because ducks have neither the need for
 Nor the ability to use umbrellas . Oh , my god .
 I got to go to the emergency room .
 Well , assuming you 're correct that your right humerus
 Is no longer seated in the glenoid socket , I would certainly think so .
 Okay , can you drive me ? I don 't drive . Well , I can 't drive !
 Well , it seems we 've reached an impasse . Ow .
 I could call you a cab or an ambulance .
 No , no , no . I can 't wait that long . You got to help me , please .
 All right .
 Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper Ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress .
 No one 's saying that . Let 's go .
 Well , it does seem rather ironic
 That for want of 99- cent adhesive ducks , We both might die in a fiery car crash .
 I wish Penny didn 't for want didn 't have to work .
 She loves camping . Yeah , that would have been great . You and Penny having sex in the tent
 While I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus .
 Okay , the best I can tell ,
 There are eight other campsites nearby .
 Mostly science nerds like us , But just over yon ridge are two
 Not unattractive middle school teachers
 Who reek of desperation .
 Wow . Wonderful . How old are they ?
 Oh I don 't know . 50 , 55 . Oh , menopause .
 Nature 's birth control .
 Come on . You guys can 't be that hard up .
 I am . Yeah , me , too .
 Look -- they gave me homeade cookies of course , they did .
 That 's what grandmothers do .
 So , what are we waiting for ? ( chuckling ) : Relax .
 I said we 'd stop by a little later
 After they have their nap . Good idea . They 'll be refreshed .
 Cookie ? Yeah .
 Thank you .
 Not bad .
 Yeah , very tasty . Well , so tell me more about these teachers . Not much to tell .
 They had a VW Microbus And were wearing tie- dyed Grateful Dead shirts .
 Huh .
 Mmm . Good cookies .

 I see no organizational system in here whatsoever .
 Which panties do you wear on mondays ?
 I don 't need panties .
 I just need shorts and a shirt .
 My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants
 In case one is in an accident . One was already in an accident .
 That doesn 't mean one won 't be in another , Especially if I 'm driving .
 Clothes , Sheldon . I need clothes !
 Okay . Here . Seriously ?
 Those shorts with that top ?

 All right . No .
 No .
 Oh , that 's cute . We should have you checked for a concussion .
 ( sighs ) okay .
 Now , you got to help me put these on . All right .
 But don 't look . Don 't look ? I don 't want you to see me naked .
 Oh .
 Well , that 's understandable . You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking
 Is well established in heroic mythology .
 Uh , Lot and his wife , Perseus and Medusa , Orpheus and Eurydi ...
 Yeah , great . They always look . It never ends well .
 Ok , now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve .
 Ok .

 Is that my arm ?
 It doesn 't feel like an arm .
 Then , maybe you should let it go .
 All righty .




 Stars are pretty , aren 't they ?
 Up above the world so high ,
 Like little diamonds in the sky .
 That 's beautiful , dude .
 You should ... You should write that down
 Before someone steals it .
 - So , when do the meteors get here ?
 - The meteors don 't get here . The earth is moving into their path . I can feel it .
 I can feel the earth moving .
 It 's moving too fast .
 Raj , slow it down .

 Okay , how 's that ?
 Better .
 Thanks .
 Stars are pretty , aren 't they ? ( laughing )
 What 's so funny ?
 It 's your American accent . Everything you say sounds stupid . ( laughing )
 ( american accent ) : " stars are pretty , aren 't they ? " ( laughing )
 ( all laughing )
 For the record , I should let you know
 This is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle .
 You have your learner 's permit , right ? Yes , and I have logged
 A considerable number of hours on a simulator .
 - Good .
 - Didn 't work out well .
 All right , can we please go ? One moment . According to my driver 's ed book , a side mirror is properly adjusted

 When a portion of the is driver 's door handle Is visible in the lower right corner .
 There 's the handle .
 Oh , no , too far .
 Bringing it back . Optimized .
 Now , where is the switch
 To adjust the passenger side mirror ? It 's right there .
 Where is the passenger side mirror ?
 In a parking lot in Hollywood .
 - Now , can we please go ? - Yes . As soon as I adjust my seat .
 Whee !

 Oh , dear .
 I 'm going to have start again .


 If I could speak the language of rabbits ,
 They would be amazed , and I would be their king .

 I hate my name .
 It has " nerd " in it .
 Len- nerd .
 I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie .
 I would be kind to my rabbit subjects .
 At first .
 You know what 's a cool name ? Angelo .
 That has angel and jell- o in it .
 It was my Uncle Murray 's funeral .
 We were all back at my Aunt Barbara 's house . Our eyes locked over the pickled herring .
 We never meant for it to happen .
 One day , I hold a great ball for the President of France ,
 But the rabbits -- they hate me and don 't come .
 I am embarrassed , so I eat all the lettuce in the world And make them watch .
 People could call me Angie .
 ( Ã la Sylvester Stallone ) :
 Yo , angie , how 's it goin ' ?
 To this day , I can 't look at pickled herring without being arroused . That is a shame . oh !
 Cousin Jeanie .
 ( sighs )
 Could you please drive a little faster ?
 Oh , I think we 're going sufficiently fast . ( mechanical clunking )
 What 's that ? Nothing .
 The engine does that sometimes . It can 't be nothing .
 The check engine light is on . We need to find a service station . No .
 The light has been on since I bought the car . All the more reason
 To consult with a mechanic before it explodes .
 It 's not going to explode . Just keep driving .
 Warp speed ahead , Mr. Spock .
 He was the science officer , and I guarantee you that

 He would pull the ship over immediately .
 Oh , god , I 'm gonna lose the arm . Oh , oh , red light .
 Release accelerator And slowly apply ... the ... brake . Nailed it .
 While we have a moment , may I ask you a question ?
 What ? Why do you have the Chinese character for soup
 Tattooed on your right buttock ?
 It 's not soup . It 's courage .
 No , it isn 't .
 But I suppose it does take courage To demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup . How did you see it ?
 You said you wouldn 't look . Sorry .
 As I told you , the hero always peeks .

 Anything ? No . That was the last pudding cup .
 No ! What about Slim Jims ?

 That 's what he used to eat his pudding , remember ? Right ! That was so good !
 Sweety and meaty at the same time .
 Wait .
 Wait , wait .
 So you 're saying
 We 're out of food ?
 The only thing in here are blue ice packs .
 I know they 're poison , But they look like big , yummy otter pops .
 Oh , god , I am so hungry . Me , too .
 Check and see if we have any more pudding .

 All right , there 's no need to bark at me .
 According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk ,
 You 'll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack ,
 But appears to be well enough
 To play Doodle Jump on his iphone . We have to fill these out .
 " describe illness or injury . "
 I dislocated my shoulder . All right .
 And how did the accident occur ?
 You ready know that . " cause of accident . "
 " lack of adhesive ducks . "

 Okay , medical history .
 " Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes ? "
 No . Kidney disease ?
 No . Migraines ?
 Getting one . " Are you currently pregnant ? " no .
 Are you sure ?
 You look a bit puffy . Change migraine to yes .
 " When was your last menstrual period ? " Oh .
 Next question . I 'll put , " in progress . " Okay , moving to psychiatric disorders .
 " list all major behavioral diagnoses , " e . g .
 Depression , anxiety , etcetera . "
 Oh , my god , what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder ? ! " episodes of sub psychotic rage . "
 Ass . " possible tourette 's . "
 All right . " moles , lesions or other skin conditions . " " soup tattoo on right buttock . "
 Hey , Sheldon , Sheldon , look , I am scared and in a lot of pain .
 Could you please just take a break from being you and try being --
 I don 't know -- comforting ?
 I 'm sorry . There , there .
 Everything 's going to be fine .

 Sheldon 's here .

 Thanks .
 That 's much better .
 Oh , I 'm so hungry ! Will you shut up ?
 We 're all hungry . Okay , our objective is
 The boy scout campsite to the east . Easy target .
 Big doughy scout master , couple of cubs , most webelos . What kind of score we looking at ?
 Hot dogs , buns , s 'mores . I mean , it 's a freaking 7- 11 .
 Leonard : All right ,
 Everyone grab flashlights . Oh , my god , could it be ?
 Yes !
 My mother put an " I love you " brisket in my backpack . Quick , get forks . You don 't need forks .
 It 's so tender , it falls apart in your hands .
 He 's right .

 I feel like we 're forgetting something important .
 Me , too . But what ?
 Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots ?
 Yes !
 Yes !
 Now remember , you were given powerful pain medication
 And a muscle relaxer ,
 So , uh , don 't operate heavy machinery .
 Try not to choke on your own drool . Wait .
 You have To help me get into bed .
 ( laughs )
 Sheldon has to get me into bed . Bet you never thought I 'd say that .
 Yes .
 The charm of your drug addled candor knows no bounds .
 You know , people think you 're this weird robot man
 Who 's so annoying all the time , and you totally are .

 You 're so full of love ,
 And you can save a plant
 And get fat people out of the floaty chairs .
 That 's a fairly labored metaphor , but I apprecte the sentiment behind it .
 Sing " Soft Kitty " to me .
 " Soft Kitty " is for when you 're sick .
 You 're not sick .
 Injured and drugged is a kind of sick .



 âª soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur ... âª
 Wait , wait . Let 's sing it as a round .
 I 'll start .
 âª soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur ... âª
 I 'll start over .
 âª soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur
 Soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur . âª âª soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur ... âª âª happy kitty , sleepy kitty âª âª happy kitty , sleepy kitty âª âª happy kitty , âª purr , purr , purr âª âª purr , purr , purr . âª
 âª ... And the next morning when he woke up ,
 He rolled over and realized ... âª duh- duh- duh ! âª ... She was his cousin .
 ( laughter )
 That 's still not funny .
 ( mockingly ) :
 That 's still not funny .
 ( laughter )
 And she was my second cousin .
 And she was my second cousin .
 ( laughs ) You 're a real douche .
 Who cares ?
 You slept with your cousin .
