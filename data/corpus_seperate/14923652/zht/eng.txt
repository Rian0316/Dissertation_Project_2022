 [ Eric ]
 Hey .
 - Hey .
 - [ Eric ]
 What happened ?
 She hemorrhaged .
 Still in surgery , and the baby 's fine , but I haven 't seen her yet .
 - I 'm gonna get more tea . See you in a bit .
 - Okay .
 Is she okay ?
 Things are kinda tense at home .
 [ sighs ]
 My mum and I had a fight .
 What about ?
 Everything .
 And nothing .
 She tried to ask me about Maeve , and I told her that everything she does is a mess .
 I was horrible , and now I ...
 I just wish I could tell her all about her .
 Your mum will be fine .
 What if she 's not ?
 She 's Jean Milburn .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 She has to be .
 Come here .
 [ emotional music continues ]
 - Michael ?
 - Hm ?
 You need to go .
 Do I have to ?
 Should we tell Adam ?
 Michael , we 're getting a divorce .
 [ sighs ]
 This is all so confusing .
 Maybe you could come over to the flat later , and I 'll cook .
 We can talk through everything then .
 Okay .
 [ exhales ]
 Okay .
 [ emotional music continues ]


 [ phone chimes ]

 Is something up with you and Adam ?
 Otis , we 're not talking about my relationship problems now .
 [ chuckles ] Please .
 Just distract me .
 [ exhales ]
 I kissed someone else in Nigeria .
 I told Adam . I think we might be over .
 I wanted to tell you , too , but I just ...
 I was so ashamed , and I didn 't know how to .
 - Do you want it to be over ?
 - I don 't know .
 I feel like a bad person . I don 't even know why I did it .
 It just ...
 It made me feel free .
 You 're not a bad person .
 [ approaching footsteps ]
 - Is my mum okay ?
 - [ doctor ] It 's too early to say .
 But we should have more information for you soon .
 Would you like to meet your sister ?
 We can see the baby .
 [ Ola exhales ]
 Uh , I 'll wait here just in case there 's updates on your mum .
 [ monitors beeping ]
 Hi , guys .
 - [ inhales ]
 - [ Otis ]
 Wow .
 - You can open the hatch if you want . - Yeah ?
 - Yeah . - Can I touch her ?
 [ Jakob ] Yeah , you can touch her . Gently .
 Hello . [ chuckles ]
 - I 'm Otis . - Yeah .
 - [ door closes ] - Ola , you 've ...
 [ Jakob sighs ]
 [ Anna ] Morning .
 [ Maeve ] Morning .
 - [ Anna ] Brought you a cup of tea . - [ Maeve ]
 Oh , thank you .
 [ Anna ] You look happy .
 Is that anything to do with Otis ?
 Look at you . You can 't stop smiling .
 [ chuckles ]
 Do you know , I 'm not planning on having anybody else take this room .
 It 's free if you 'd like it .
 Elsie loves having you here .
 I 'd really like that .
 - Do I have to keep that shit on the wall ?
 - [ Anna laughs ]
 No . You can have whatever you want on the walls .
 Okay , good .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ phone chimes ]







 - Maeve ! - Good morning .
 Good ... Oh my ... Good morning !
 Oh my God !

 What are we gonna do today ?
 - [ Elsie giggles ]
 - Hmm ?
 Whoo !
 [ door closes ]
 [ Maureen ] Adam ?
 Oh , I 'm just popping to pick up some things for Jean Milburn .
 What 's this ?
 I , uh , I 'm competing with Madam tonight .
 I didn 't think you would wanna come .
 Of course I wanna be there .
 Is your friend Eric coming ?
 Uh , no . We ... we had a fight .
 Oh .
 Sorry to hear that .
 I really wish you 'd told me about this .
 People like to be asked to go to things .
 Makes them feel like you care .
 I will ask next time .
 [ door opens , closes ]
 - [ knocking at door ]
 - [ door opens ]
 - I 'm off for my run . - [ Jackson ]
 Okay .
 - Hey , Mum . - Hm ?
 Um , did you always know that you were a lesbian ?
 Why ?
 Oh , I just never asked before . It 's fine if you don 't wanna answer , I ...
 No , no , no , no .
 Um ...
 I actually didn 't connect with that part of myself until I met your mum .
 Oh , so it 's more about the person ?
 Well , I think I was in denial for a long time .
 I had a lot of shame .
 I mean , I always knew those feelings were there .
 I just didn 't know .
 Does that make sense ?
 Yeah .
 Yeah , I think so .
 Sorry you felt shame , Mum .
 Did you want to tell me something ?
 [ laughs ]
 I 'm not telling you that I 'm gay .
 - Well ... - Thanks though .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ chuckles ]
 Actually , can I join you for your run ?
 - Yes . - Yeah ?
 - If you remember where your trainers are .
 - [ chuckles ]
 - Come on , then ! - All right .
 [ door closes ]
 [ emotional music playing ]
 - [ knocking at door ]
 - [ door opens ]
 Oh , you 're dressed !
 Do you want a lift to school ?
 [ sighs ]
 [ Otis ] Did you guys decide on a name ?
 No .
 We couldn 't agree .
 [ Jakob chuckles ]
 - Did you pick Ola 's name ? - No .
 Her mother did .
 [ sighs ]
 It 'd be bad luck if my mum died .
 ' Cause your wife died . You 'd be cursed .
 - I don 't know why I said that . - It 's all right .
 It 's because you 're scared .
 [ exhales ]
 I 'm scared too .
 If something happens to my mum , I don 't wanna live with my dad .
 Otis ,
 I know I 'm not your father ... but I 'm not going anywhere .
 - You didn 't finish the tree house .
 - [ chuckles ] Yeah .
 Won 't be much time now ...
 - [ door opens ]
 - ... with this little one .
 Any news about my partner ?
 [ doctor ] They found the cause of the bleed , but they 're still operating .
 Gonna be all right .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 [ vehicle approaching ]
 [ car door closes ]
 - Hello , Aimee .
 - Oh , hi , Mrs. Groff .
 Oh , wait . Can I still call you that ?
 I heard you 're getting a divorce .
 Oh .
 Maureen is fine .
 I 'm here for an appointment with Dr. Milburn , but no one 's in .
 Oh , she went into labor .
 I 'm just picking up some stuff for her .
 Oh my God ! Maureen , babes , this is huge !
 [ Goat bleats ]
 Oh yeah , Mum couldn 't look after Goat today .
 [ bleating ]
 - Can I use the bathroom ?
 - Yeah , sure .
 I 'm dying for a poo .
 I 'm so anxious , I think it 's gonna be a sloppy one .
 Oh .
 [ music stops ]
 You know , I think I saw an alien once .
 It was when I was at nursing college , and I was coming back from the pub .
 Suddenly , there was this immensely bright , green light in the sky .
 It got closer and closer , and I could feel the hairs on my arms and neck standing up .
 Then it ... it just vanished .
 Were you drunk , Mum ?
 I have no idea what it was .
 Maybe you should still go to the Eighth thing later , love .
 I mean , you never know .
 I think it 's time I outgrew the alien thing .
 But thanks .
 Can you throw that stuff out for me ?
 I don 't need it anymore .
 - See you after school .
 - Okay .
 Bye .
 - Bye . - Bye .
 - Bye . - Bye .
 - Buh- bye .
 - [ gasps , screams ]
 Ooh !
 [ squealing ]
 Miss ?
 - Yes . - I , uh , I took your advice .
 About how everyone 's good at something .
 Hm .
 [ chuckles ]
 - Wait , is this tonight ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 Okay . I 'll try my best to be there .
 - Oh , hello . - Hi .
 You 're back early .
 Yeah , I got a call saying I could come back in , so ...
 How are you ?
 [ inhales ]
 Uh , Eric kissed someone else .
 You 're probably happy to hear that .
 I 'm actually not .
 Yeah , it feels shit .
 I hate him , which is annoying because I also love him .
 I know that feeling , yeah .
 What 's this ?
 I 'm competing in a thing where tiny dogs jump through hoops and shit .
 That 's really stupid , man .
 Charming .
 [ whimsical music playing ] [ boy ]
 Whoo !
 What 's going on ?
 She 's gone ! Her office is empty !
 Holy fuck !
 - Oh my God ! - [ Vivienne ] I don 't believe it .
 - [ Rahim ] Explains why they let me back . - She 's gone .
 - No loitering !
 [ laughs ] - [ gasps ]
 - Your face . What 's going on ? - Hope 's gone .
 - Huh ?
 - Yeah . Is someone gonna take over ?
 Maybe you should apply , sir .
 [ chuckles ]
 No , I 'm serious .
 Mm .
 Yeah .
 [ whimsical music continues ]
 [ music stops ]
 What do you want ?
 Um ...
 Oh , a KitKat . Always a KitKat .
 [ coins jingle ]
 - [ Eric ] Thank you , Sugar Daddy .
 - Mm- hmm .
 [ vending machine beeps ] [ motor whirring ]
 - Oh my God ! - No !
 [ Otis sighs ]
 Why does this always happen ?
 - Every time . Every time . - Innit ?
 Come on .
 Come on ! [ Eric ] Uh , I don 't think that 's helping .
 [ chuckles ]
 I can probably reach it . I have long arms . I can reach it .
 [ announcement over PA ]
 - Uh , don 't get stuck . - I can do it .
 - I don 't need a KitKat . - I can do it .
 Okay .
 - [ bang ]
 - Come on !
 Just ... I heard a man got trapped under a vending machine , and he died .
 [ sobs ] [ exhales ] [ sobs ] I can do it !
 Fuck !
 - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , mate .
 - [ Otis sobbing ]
 [ sniffles ] She can 't ... she can 't die .
 Oh no . Oh no , she won 't .
 She won 't . She can 't .
 Will you be long ? I just wanna get a packet of Hula Hoops .
 Excuse me ?
 Can you not see that we are very upset here ?
 - [ Otis ] It 's fine . - [ Eric ]
 Go away .
 Right now .
 - [ chuckles ] - [ Eric ] Get out of here !
 Now !
 Nonsense !
 Unbelievable .
 [ both laughing ]
 Jean is out of surgery .
 - [ Jackson ]
 Uh , why are you so happy ?
 - [ laughing ]
 Because Hope resigned , and Eugene is here .
 Uh- uh !
 [ laughing ]
 [ clears throat ]
 I 'm gonna go call Eugene .
 So ...
 I acted a bit like an idiot yesterday .
 Mm- hmm .
 [ chuckles ]
 I think your cishet brain maybe exploded a bit .
 [ chuckles ]
 You didn 't have to run away .
 - I freaked out .
 - Mm- hmm .
 [ bell ringing ]
 I have a free period later if you wanna talk about it .
 - Yes .
 - [ chuckles ] I 'll come find you , okay ?
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ music ends ]
 [ mischievous music playing ]
 Knickers .
 Three .
 Oh !
 [ exhales ]
 [ suspenseful music playing ]
 [ toilet flushing ]
 I wouldn 't go in there for a bit if I were you .
 - Oh .
 [ chuckles ] - No , seriously .
 Do you want to talk about why you 're feeling anxious ?
 Yeah .
 I need to break up with my boyfriend .
 He 's so lovely to me , but I 've changed so much , and I want to know who I am on my own .
 Mm .
 I don 't think I know that either .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 It 's so difficult to be alone .
 There are so many man jobs I don 't know how to do .
 Yeah ! Steve is so good at opening my crisps .
 Hm .
 Well , it probably will be hard , but if you feel you want to spend some time with yourself , you should take that opportunity .
 Your boyfriend will be all right .
 [ chuckles ]
 Can I ask you something ?
 You know Adam ?
 Well , obviously .
 - [ chuckles ]
 - Yeah .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Do you think he 's happy ?
 Oh , well , we don 't really talk .
 He doesn 't really have many friends , but he seems happier now he 's with Eric .
 Oh .
 Right . [ chuckles ]
 Toothbrush .
 - Okay . - [ both laugh ]
 Oh .
 - I think , then , I 've got everything . - Great . I 'll meet you outside .
 [ Maureen ] Okay .
 [ door opens ]
 - Oops . - What ?
 - I left the keys inside . - [ gasps ] Oh fuck !
 What ?
 Goat .
 There she is .
 Oh !
 - Hey . - Hello , darling .
 - Hey , Mum . - [ both chuckle ]
 - Do I have three eyes ? - No , no .
 No , you just have two .
 [ sighs ]
 Feels like I 've got three .
 - [ Otis ] Yeah .
 - Mmm .
 Oh , I 've got something to tell you .
 Very important .
 I 've been meaning to tell you for a very long time .
 Yeah ?
 [ inhales ]
 I am the king .
 [ inhales ]
 The king of what ?
 The King of Everything .
 [ laughs ]
 Isn 't that the best news you 've ever heard ?
 - Yeah , that 's pretty great .
 - Mm .
 I knew you 'd think so .
 - [ Jean sighs ]
 - [ chuckles ]
 Oh my God .
 - Why am I wearing this horrible dress ? - Mum . Mum , just ... just rest .
 - Just lie ... just lie down . - [ gasps ] Someone 's taken my knickers .
 - Has he taken my knickers ? - [ Jakob ] No .
 - Um ...
 - Did he take them ?
 Darling , I think he took my knickers .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ music fades ]
 My mum thinks she 's the king .
 What ?
 She 's high on anesthetic .
 She told me she 's the King of Everything .
 [ laughing ]
 [ exhales ]
 - Oh , I 'm really glad she 's okay , man . - Yeah .
 [ both chuckle ]
 You 've been an amazing friend , but you need to go talk to Adam now .
 Oh God ! [ sighs ]
 I don 't know what to say to him .
 Just tell him how you feel .
 ... the energy required to completely remove an electron from an atom of an element to form an ion .
 So , ionization energy . You 're all to know that formula for your exam on Monday .
 If you look in your textbooks on page 32 , you will see ...
 [ Erin ] Over here !
 You 're supposed to be on the run . [ Erin ] I know that .
 That 's why I 'm hiding .
 You should come in the bush with me .
 Mum , you need to disappear .
 I had to give you something .
 - What 's this ? - I want you to go do that America thing .
 - Where did you get it ? - It doesn 't matter . I sold some shit .
 - [ scoffs ] - I want you to go .
 It 's too late anyway .
 Supposed to leave tomorrow . I haven 't paid , so ...
 Well , call 'em up and charm 'em . Try not to sound so angry .
 I can 't .
 Yes , you can .
 Mum ...
 I 'm moving in with Anna .
 I feel really guilty , like I 've left you behind .
 No .
 You never left me behind .
 I left you behind .
 I was too young and stupid to have kids .
 I 've let you down over and over again .
 That 's why I need you to take this money and go to America .
 Or buy yourself something pretty for your new room .
 Now , I don 't wanna hear any more about it .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 - [ cries ]
 - [ Erin ]
 Oh .
 [ sniffles ]
 - [ Erin ] I gotta go .
 - [ patting Maeve 's back ]
 [ sniffles ]

 [ phone chimes ]

 [ sniffles ]
 So I thought about it a lot .
 I just don 't think I 'm queer .
 - I figured as much . - [ chuckles ]
 I thought you were all about breaking out of boxes .
 So what does it matter if I 'm queer or if I 'm not ?
 Because I 'm not a girl , and I 'm worried you still see me as one .
 Yeah , maybe I do .
 But I 'm open , like , I 'm ... willing to learn .
 [ Cal ] Here 's the thing .
 I 'm still figuring out so much shit about myself .
 I can 't carry you too .
 And I still wanna have fun when I can because I feel so heavy all the time .
 [ chuckles ]
 So , what does this mean ?
 It means that we can still be friends .
 [ both chuckle ]
 I don 't really have friends that I 've been with like that .
 There 's a first for everything .
 I do really like you .
 I really like you too .
 I 'm sorry that this isn 't gonna work out .
 [ announcement chimes ]

 [ emotional music playing ]
 [ Jackson chuckles ]

 Oh , Mark ! Hello .
 I was wondering whether you and I could have a conversation about the head teacher position .
 What do you want to know ?
 I would like to put myself forward for the job .
 I have worked at Moordale for seven years .
 - I have a good understanding ...
 - Sorry , uh ...
 - Emily . Yeah . - Emily .
 Emily .
 We 're not taking applications currently , but thanks .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 Can you sign your story ?
 [ girl ] Glenoxi 's my hero .


 No . No , no .
 I 'm the grown- up .
 [ mischievous music playing ]
 [ breathing anxiously ]
 Oh !
 [ gasps ] It 's open ! Go , Maureen !
 Go , Maureen ! Go , Maureen ! Go , Maureen !
 [ gasps ]
 Goat ?
 [ Maureen ] I think Goat might be a lesbian .
 [ Goat bleating ]
 [ Mark ]
 Following the coverage of yesterday 's events , our investors have pulled all of their funding from the school .
 [ students ] What ?
 So we have no choice but to sell Moordale Secondary to developers .
 [ students ] What ?
 [ Mark ]
 Now , I have been sent to tell you personally because , as sixth formers , this decision could have a dire effect on your futures .
 You will need to find educational alternatives to complete your schooling by the end of this term .
 - [ students groaning ]
 - [ boy ]
 This term ?
 Basically , you guys are fucked .
 [ students exclaiming ]
 Shit .
 That backfired .
 - What a waste of time . - Hey .
 Speaking up for what you believe in is never a waste of time .
 You did the right thing .
 Thanks , miss .
 I was not expecting that .
 [ Adam ]
 Listen , I , uh ... was wondering if you 'd read my poem .
 I wanna give it to Eric , but I think it 's still shit .
 Okay , I 'll read it for you .
 Um , they 're selling the school .
 What ? When ?
 - Adam , I 'm so sorry . I ... - Stop apologizing .
 Can we walk home together ?
 Yeah .
 [ pensive music playing ]
 I 'll give you a hand .
 Thanks .
 This woman bumped into me , and she didn 't even say sorry .
 Oh , it 's you .
 You have a bit of lipstick on your teeth .
 [ groans ]
 I 've had a shit 24 hours .
 Yeah , I heard .
 Would you like some KitKat ?
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 What the fuck ?
 [ toilet flushing ]
 Hey .
 - [ clears throat ]
 - [ water running ]
 Hey , are you following me ? Because you 're starting to freak me out .
 I ... I wanted to say sorry .
 [ water stops ]
 - For what ? - For not speaking up .
 That 's okay . You 'll speak up when you 're ready .
 Also , uh ,
 I need your help .
 - Delivery .
 - Oh .
 Maureen , thank you .
 It means a lot .
 She 's out of surgery .
 - Oh , thank goodness . - Yeah .
 I 'll pop in when she 's feeling stronger , but if there 's anything else I can do , anything , just ask .
 [ sighs ] Thank you .
 See you .

 [ phone chimes ]

 Hi , kid .
 How long you been sitting here ?
 I think I did this , Dad .
 What do you mean ?
 I think I made all this bad stuff happen to Jean .
 I said some really terrible things to her .
 I had some really horrible thoughts .
 Jean is awake .
 And she 's fine .
 - Okay . - Okay ?
 And we all have horrible thoughts sometimes .
 Doesn 't mean bad things will happen .
 Something bad did happen .
 [ Jakob sighs ]
 - Dad ? - Yeah ?
 [ kisses ]
 I 'm pleased that you 're happy with Jean and that you 're moving on .
 But I 'm also really worried you 'll like your new family more than me because I remind you of the pain .
 You remind me of joy .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Only joy .
 [ chuckles ]
 Okay ?
 Okay .
 [ Adam ] I 'm thinking that maybe we could pretend it didn 't happen .
 But it did happen .
 I messed up .
 Badly .
 I ... I can be okay with it . It was a stupid kiss .
 It didn 't mean anything . I can get over ...
 I don 't think it was just a stupid kiss , Adam .
 Did you ... did you sleep with this guy ?
 Is that ...
 No .
 That 's not what I mean .
 We only kissed , but it wasn 't stupid .
 It was something .
 You don 't feel bad ?
 Yes , I feel bad .
 I feel bad I hurt you .
 But you wouldn 't take it back ?
 No , I don 't think I would .
 - It felt easy with him .
 - Mm .
 [ sniffles ]
 And it feels hard with me .
 I just feel like I 'm ...
 I 'm ready to fly , and you 're just learning to walk .
 And I 've worked really hard to find myself , and I 'm beginning to lose who I am .
 We 're gonna break up , aren 't we ?
 - I think we have to . - Yeah .
 It 's not your fault .
 [ splutters ]
 We 're just going in different directions .
 - Adam , can we keep talking ?
 - Mm ...
 Uh ... [ inhales ]
 Don 't ... [ " I Get Along Without You Very Well " by Chet Baker playing ] ... have anything else to say .

 Oh .
 Sweet baby girl , you 've had a tough time of it .
 [ Jakob exhales ]
 Well , she 's definitely not a Thor .
 Oh , I don 't know .
 It might be growing on me .
 [ Jakob chuckles ]
 [ Jakob ] Look at that .
 I think she definitely wants to meet you .
 [ Jakob ] Yeah , come .
 [ exhales ]
 You can open the hatch .
 [ latch clicks ]
 [ exhales ]
 [ Ola ] Hello .
 [ emotional music playing ] [ exhales ]
 Maybe we should call her Joy .
 Joy .
 I like that .
 Me too .
 Did you know the school was gonna close ?
 [ Hope scoffs ] You all thought you were being so smart yesterday .
 But you 've only destroyed yourselves .
 I thought we made a pretty good case .
 You know , I 'm not much older than you , but my generation knew how to conduct themselves .
 We knew what was important .
 The issues we talked about have always been there .
 People just haven 't felt safe enough to raise them .
 That 's what 's changing .
 [ Hope ] Thank you .

 So what you gonna do now ?
 I 've been trying to get pregnant for three years .
 I 'm currently trying to start another round of IVF .
 Well , I hope it works out . It won 't . It won 't .
 You have no idea what it 's like to wake up to the feeling of failure every morning .
 [ sobs ]
 I 'm sorry . I 'm clearly having ... [ breathes deeply ] ... some kind of breakdown .
 How are you a failure ?
 Because my ... my body won 't ... won 't ...
 It doesn 't do the ... the one thing it 's supposed to do .
 The one thing I want it to do .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 [ Hope ] But you can 't have everything , I suppose .
 And dwelling on it makes me weak .
 [ Otis ] I don 't think you 're weak .
 I think saying you feel disappointed by something you want but maybe can 't have makes you honest .
 And admitting your vulnerabilities makes you courageous .
 [ Hope ] Yeah .
 [ sobs ] It 's very hard .
 [ shuddered breath ]
 [ sobs ] But thank you .
 - Darling ?
 - Hey .
 - Could you help me back to the room ? - Yeah .
 [ Hope clears throat ]
 Congratulations , Dr. Milburn .
 Thank you .
 [ audience clapping ]
 [ dog owner ] Come on !

 [ male announcer ]
 [ chuckles ]


 [ audience clapping ]
 I overheard some of your conversation with Hope .
 It was really beautiful how you navigated that .
 I know we 've had fights about it , darling , and I never want you to not pursue an interest in therapy .
 I just really want you to know the weight of the responsibility .
 I think I do .
 I can 't really explain why I love talking to people .
 It 's just ...
 Like a rush ?
 Yeah .
 A rush of connection .
 I didn 't mean what I said about all your relationships being a mess .
 I actually think you 're brave .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 I kind of thought you were gonna die , you know ?
 I realized I still ...
 I still behave
 like a child most of the time , and I pretend to be so grown- up .
 I still need you .
 I can 't not have a mum .
 You 're not a child .
 You 're a young man , and sometimes I find that difficult to accept .
 And I 'm sorry .
 And thank you for being so brave .
 You must be exhausted . Why don 't you go home and get some rest ?
 [ sniffles ]
 - Love you . - Mm , I love you too .
 There 's someone called Maeve , and she 's really important to me .
 I know I don 't really understand anything about love , but I think she 's my person .
 Oh , sweetheart . I don 't know if any of us understand much about love .
 I just know we feel it when we feel it .
 I can 't wait to meet her .
 [ laughing ]
 [ breathes deeply ]
 [ suspenseful music playing ]
 Oh shit .

 [ chuckles ]
 - [ knocking at door ]
 - [ door opens ]
 You okay ?
 Yeah .
 [ inhales ]
 There was someone I liked a lot , but it didn 't work out , so ...
 That sounds shit .
 [ chuckles ]
 Shall we have ice cream , talk about it ?
 [ chuckles ]
 [ Cal ] I did it for a while with Ace bandages . [ chuckles ]
 Until I nearly broke a rib .
 I didn 't realize they tighten over time , so they can restrict breathing severely .
 [ Cal chuckles ]
 - How are you doing , Layla ?
 - I 'm ... I 'm good .
 Wow !
 You 're glowing . - Truly ! Yeah .
 - [ laughs ]
 All right , so that binder is designed for safer chest compression .
 You might be tempted to wear two binders or wear a size smaller , but you shouldn 't .
 Okay .
 Yeah ?
 How does it feel ?
 [ laughs ]
 It feels so much better .
 [ Cal ] Yeah ?
 - Yeah .
 - I 'm so proud of you .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ dog barks ]

 And now competing for the first time , it 's Adam Groff and Madam the Cavapoo .
 [ audience clapping ]
 And through !
 [ Adam ] Over .
 And through ! And over !
 Good .
 [ Adam ]
 [ Adam ]
 [ Adam ]













 [ Adam ]
 Yes , Madam !
 Over !
 - Over ! Good girl . - [ barks ]
 - Oh .
 - Beautifully done !
 That 's my son .
 [ chuckles ] [ audience clapping ]
 [ song ends ]
 Hey . Just tried you .
 I was at the shops .
 You going somewhere ?
 [ sighs ] Yeah .
 Anna asked me to move in with her .
 - I acted like a dick , didn 't I ?
 - Yeah .
 You did , but , you know ...
 I 'm sorry .
 So you 're finally getting out of this place , then ?
 Congratulations .
 I still want you in my life if you do .
 - As friends , maybe . - Maybe .
 Probably . But let 's give it some time , yeah ?

 [ car horn honking ]
 Better go .
 I would offer to help you with your case , but , um , you 're on your own , I 'm afraid .
 [ chuckles ]
 That 's fair enough .
 See ya .
 On your way , sucker .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Time to announce the three winners of the toy dog agility runs .
 This is the one .
 In third place ,
 Kelly Fuller and Twinkle Twinkle .
 - She was very good though . - Yeah , she was .
 In second place ,
 Francesca Hull and Bark Wahlberg .
 [ dog barking ]
 [ dog barking ]
 First place goes to ...
 Okay .
 ... Frank Larson and Howard the Jug .
 [ dog barking ]
 And a special mention tonight goes to Adam Groff and Madam for one of the best debut performances we 've seen in a long time .
 Give 'em a round of applause .
 [ both whooping ]
 Hi .
 How 'd you know I was here ?
 I didn 't . It 's the Eighth tonight .
 This is where it 's supposed to happen .
 [ laughs ]
 - Why are you laughing ? - I thought this was a bit random .
 Oh , yeah .
 Why are you here ?
 This is my mum 's favorite place .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 I 'm sorry . I ... I didn 't realize how much you were missing your mum .
 I think we 've both been distracted .
 I 'm sorry I said that aliens weren 't real .
 I want to try and be more open- minded .
 It 's beautiful here .
 She really loved this view .
 I wish I could tell her about you .
 I know she 'd love you .
 - Oh , here he is .
 - Hm .
 [ Adam chuckles ] Is that Eric ?

 Uh , no , it was a ... friend .
 Um , Eric wasn 't my friend , Mum .
 He was my boyfriend .
 We broke up .
 Please don 't tell Dad I didn 't win a proper prize .
 Okay .
 Why ?
 He would just be disappointed .

 [ Otis ]
 Hey .
 Okay , what are you doing ?
 Well , you know , I wanted to finish it before they bring the baby home .
 - Aw .
 - You look amazing . - Thank you .
 - Uncle Eric ... ... is here .
 [ laughs ]
 I don 't know if I 'm dressed for DlY .
 How 'd it go with , um , Adam ?
 We broke up .
 - Oh , bro . - Yeah , it was horrible .
 [ chuckles ]
 Do you wanna talk about it ?
 No .
 - Let 's finish this tree house . - Yes !
 How ... What is this ?
 That 's a hammer .
 Five , four , three , two , one !
 [ all ]
 [ crowd groans ]
 Maybe it 'll happen next time .
 Do you wanna stay a bit longer ?
 No , it 's okay .
 [ Ola gasps ] Lily , look !
 - [ crowd exclaims ]
 - [ laughs ]
 - [ Aimee ] Maeve ? - Yeah ?
 What the hell is this ?
 My mum gave it to me for the trip to America .
 They booked me on a flight tomorrow , but I 'm not going .
 Uh , why ?
 Because things are good with Otis .
 I don 't wanna mess it up again , so ...
 Oh my God . Maeve Wiley , come here now .
 - Sit down .
 - [ chuckles ]
 - I 'm talking to you as your second mother .
 - Mm- hmm .
 If you decide to not go to America and make your disgustingly big brain even bigger ,
 I 'm gonna have to end our friendship .
 A bit harsh .
 If I was gonna miss out on an opportunity for a boy , what would you tell me ?
 Probably to screw your head back on .
 Exactly .
 [ both chuckle ]
 Don 't forget about me .
 [ Maeve ] Impossible .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 [ Aimee ] Right .
 We better get you packed , then . Again .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ sighs ]
 - [ Otis ] So no more Moordale .
 - [ Eric ]
 Mm .
 [ Otis ] What are we gonna do ?
 Well , as long as we 've got each other , we 'll be all right .
 [ Maeve ] Otis ?
 [ Otis chuckles ]
 [ Eric ] Come one , come on . Come on !
 [ Otis ]
 Hey .
 What are you doing here ?
 Mm , um ...
 [ breathes deeply ]
 Okay , um ... [ clears throat ]
 I 've changed my mind .
 About what ?
 America .
 I found the money , so I 'm going .
 Right .
 When ?
 Now .
 Wow .
 - Yeah .
 - Oh .
 You know you don 't need my help for the clinic , right ?
 It 's your gift .
 Yeah , and what about us ?
 [ emotional music playing ]
 We 'll see where we 're at when I 'm back .
 [ breathes deeply ]
 Proud of you .
 - I mean it .
 - [ chuckles ]
 - America ? - Yeah .
 So this is goodbye .
 No .
 No .
 It 's see you soon .
 [ Otis chuckles ]
 [ Otis sniffles ]
 Okay , cool . Wish me luck .
 Yeah .
 Bye , Eric .
 Bye , Maeve .
