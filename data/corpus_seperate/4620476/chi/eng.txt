 I 'll go check on your salads .
 Oleg , what 's the hold up with the salads ?
 I never made one before .
 My two favorite guys , Big Doug and Sancho , are ordering salads ?
 What happened to their usual BLTs ?
 Burgers , lasagna , and tacos ?
 They said they want to lose weight .
 And no matter what you order , it 's easier to throw up here than at home .
 I don 't get why nobody wants to be fat anymore .
 The fat seasons of Oprah were always the best .
 You 're right .
 Every other year of Oprah was the best years .
 What is this I hear about you blushing beauties on a diet ?
 Oh , we 're not blushing .
 We 're just still flushed from sitting down .
 And we 're trying to get in shape .
 Yeah , preferably a shape that doesn 't resemble a seasonal gourd .
 Plus my girlfriend wants me to slim down so we can sit on the same side of the plane when we travel .
 Well , Big Doug , you tell that lucky lady that I would rather date a man with boobs bigger than mine than a man who brings his own salad dressing to a restaurant .

 Pie me .
 Cherry , pumpkin , or coconut cream ?
 Yes .
 Max Black , bringing smiles to men 's faces since puberty .

 I just talked to this guy at ...
 I think it 's table three , I still don 't know the numbers .
 Anyway , he asked , " What 's new ? "
 And I told him we were opening a dessert bar at the airport tomorrow .
 Then I realized he was asking what kind of pot
 I was selling this week .
 Why are you telling people about us and the airport ?
 It 's like when you told everyone you thought you had HPV .
 That was a state- mandated kind of thing .
 Oh , look who it is ... the airport people .
 You guys putting together a little happy hour ?
 With the jocks at Southwest ?
 Or the " in crowd " at the Virgin Terminal ?
 You know who 's going to be a terminal virgin ?
 You can make all the death threats you want , but you know what will keep me alive ?
 The fact that you two work at the airport .
 Hey , everybody !
 Here comes the almost bride .
 Did you ever see a prettier almost bride ?
 I mean , you know , besides Jennifer Aniston .
 Sophie , it 's only one week till the wedding , so this is your last chance to take a run at me .
 Now you won 't be disappointed .
 I 'm still very sexually active for the first five minutes .
 Oh , Earl .
 If I took a run at you , you 'd go right through that wall like Wile E. Coyote .

 Hey , bridesmaid .
 Hey , Sophie .
 Hey , Oleg .
 You got a message from your brother in the Ukraine .
 Yoshinko called ?
 Yeah , hear this message .
 What was the message ?
 " Hey , Oleg , did you see last night 's Alf ? "
 Nah ...
 I don 't speak Ukrainian .
 I mean , what am I , a plumber in Queens ?
 No , so I brought the whole thing in .
 Here he is .
 Oleg ...
 Good- bye .
 What did he say ?
 He 's not coming .
 I understood a little
 ' cause I had a Russian Au pair growing up .
 You know , until she bleached my good jeans .
 Yoshinko can 't come to the wedding .
 He 's on a no- fly list , a no- drive list , and a no- walk list .
 He 's in jail .
 Oh , but he was gonna be your best man .
 I got a ham engraved for him .
 Don 't worry , baby , I 'll find someone .
 It could be anyone .
 He doesn 't even have to be the best or even good .
 I 'll have to lower my standards .
 Han , will you be my best man ?
 You said lower , not sub- basement .
 Well , Oleg , I 'll need to think about it .
 Yes .
 Great .
 So Han , you 're in charge of the bachelor party tomorrow .
 I want a night that will disgrace all involved .
 A night where no one can look each other in the eye at brunch the next day .
 Wow , Han .
 Bachelor party 's a big responsibility .
 Do you know any grown- ups who can buy you beer ?
 Max , hurry .
 The grand opening of this pink airport dungeon is in a few minutes .
 That TSA line took forever .
 The woman with all those nickels ?
 I haven 't seen that much change on a lady since Chaz Bono .
 Don 't worry ,
 I 'm making friends in the TSA .
 Judy , big gal , little beard ?
 Having lunch with her at the Wok N ' Roll near Malaysia Airlines .
 It 's pretty quiet over there these days .
 Hey , ladies .
 Opening day , I 'm so excited my nipples have been shooting daggers since I woke up .
 Seriously , I haven 't been this excited since my parents sent me to military school .
 God , does everything have to be fun when you 're gay ?
 If it isn 't , you 're not doing it right .
 I 'm just happy I get to be out front here .
 Finally , I won 't be stuffed in the back .
 I mean unless I run into a Republican senator in the men 's room .
 Come on , let 's open up .
 But DAT key though ?
 I love this job .
 Wait , should someone make a speech ?
 A speech ?
 If you want to hear my thoughts on opening this place ,
 I 'll just CC you on my suicide note .
 Fine , I 'll make a speech .
 To all the school janitors who told me I 'd never have my own giant set of keys , too big for any pocket , and that I wasn 't a good kisser ?

 They can all suck it .
 Yes !
 Rise , gate , rise !
 Ooh , you go , gate .
 Yes , I 'm drunk with power .
 Also , a little drunk .
 All right .
 Here they come .
 Yep .
 Any minute .
 Just our luck .
 The one day the airport isn 't crowded .
 Well , I guess I have time to go check my make- up in the men 's room .
 It 's Han .
 He wants us to come to Oleg 's bachelor party tonight .
 I 've gotten a call like this before , but usually it 's through a service that involves making some tassels spin in opposite directions .
 No way .
 You know I was planning on going home and crying tonight .
 Han is planning a party .
 You will cry there for sure .
 That 's true .
 I really can cry anywhere now .
 I guess I 've got that at least .
 I can 't believe I work at the airport , Max .
 Hey , would you feel better if you held my giant keys ?
 Hello ?
 Hello .
 Welcome , you 're our first customer .
 Do I get a prize ?
 Is it you ?
 I 'm on board now .
 I love this job .
 Welcome , everyone .
 I 'm your M. C. , Han Lee , gonna get the crazy party started here with some dirty , racy jokes .
 This is the deadest place I 've ever been to , and I once woke up in Heaven .
 Okay , here we go .
 What do a Rubik 's Cube and a penis have in common ?
 The more you play with it , the harder it gets .
 A Rubik 's Cube was a popular '80s toy .
 You suck !
 Next act .
 What do a walrus and a Tupperware have in common ?
 Hold on a minute .
 Something about a seal being tight ...
 Oh !
 I just got a text from Josh , the pilot .
 He says , " What 's up , you ? "
 Isn 't that cute ?
 Cute that he forgot your name ?
 It 's really been a long time for you , hasn 't it ?
 I took off my underwear last week and a coyote howled .
 Tough crowd .
 I 'm talking about you , Max .
 Oh come on , Han .
 Loosen up .
 Have a drink .
 A martini , an appletini , anything teeny .
 Nah , just do a vodka shot .
 If nothing else , the glass will look normal- sized in your hand and I 'll have a laugh .
 Can 't hurt .
 But it did .
 Thanks for the party , Han .
 What time is it starting ?
 I 've never been a best man .
 It 's a lot of pressure .
 Yeah , being a man would be hard for you .
 You 've never been one before .
 Let alone the best one .
 What 's in that , ground glass ?
 Ugh , this party is worse than the communist party .
 And they killed half my family .
 Oleg , don 't worry , I 'll get this party started .
 I 'm making a call to some girls I went to school with .
 The Slut Academy on Seventh .
 Commonly known as NYU .
 I 'm more concerned about my cousin .
 He has something I need .
 Soap ? Deodorant ?
 The toughest actin ' Tinactin ?
 Oh , there he is !
 Hey , hey .
 Mwah , mwah .
 Well , he didn 't bring the deodorant .
 Yuri , you made it .
 Are you the stripper ?
 Probably in a few years .
 Did you bring the papers ?
 The papers I need to get married ?
 And those little Ukrainian candies I love ?
 Bad news .
 The guy who made the fake papers got deported .
 They took the papers .
 I ate the candy .
 What 'd I miss ?
 Besides my chance to become something ?
 Are you the stripper ?
 Nyet .
 A compliment and an insult in just one word .
 Oh , no .
 Oh no , no , no , no , no .
 Did I mention " no " ?
 How can you say the word " no " but not understand it when women say it ?
 This is a disaster .
 And not the kind where I can loot .
 I needed those fake papers to renew my fake green card .
 Mine expires next month .
 Since when do you care about expiration dates ?
 You cook with eggs so old they fight back .
 Sophie will never believe that I 'm not marrying her just for a green card .
 She has major trust issues since one day , her father went out for pierogies and ... came back without pierogies .
 I 'm really enjoying the dance stylings of Camel and Toe up there .
 Everyone is having fun except Oleg .
 I haven 't seen him so much as put the " V " fingers in front of his mouth at any of these ladies .
 Ooh !
 Wouldn 't mind some over the sweater action with her .
 Hers or yours ?
 Max , I just did something I 've never done .
 Told a story about someone else ?
 No , I sent the pilot a boob pic .
 Girl , you nasty .
 I know .
 I am nasty !
 I just looked into the camera with my boobs out and hit send .
 Ah- ha , that 's awesome .
 Uh , circling back now , did you say you looked into the camera ?
 You didn 't put your face in it , did you ?
 Girl !
 You stupid .
 How else would he know it was me ?
 You never put your face in it .
 Didn 't I raise you better than this ?
 Well , at least you weren 't smiling in it .
 All right , what kind of smile ?
 A flirty smirk could work .
 A come- hither grin would be great .
 More like ...
 So you were in this ... pose with your yabbos out ?
 So you basically did a nude yogurt ad .
 Yeah , but like yogurt you want to have sex with , right ?
 Oh , my God .
 Sophie will be here any minute .
 When I called , she was washing her hair .
 She was going to put it back on her head and come .
 Just be honest with her .
 Sometimes the truth is ugly .
 But she knows that .
 She 's seen you naked .
 Well , still no text back so apparently not as ugly as this .
 What 's that about ?
 Are you selling real estate now ?
 Oh , wow .
 I mean , this party couldn 't get any sleazier unless you invited Robin Thicke .
 I 'm looking up at skanky whore city , but I trust you , Oleg .
 You do ?
 Yeah , why wouldn 't I ?
 Aside from my complicated past full of men that have lied to me .
 But you and I don 't have secrets from each other , right , Oleg ?
 Yeah , well , you see ...
 It is time for the traditional best man speech .
 So listen up , bitches .
 Ow , damn it .
 I am bleeding .
 Repeat , I am bleeding .
 I can 't believe this .
 There 's an app that burps when you shake your phone , but no app that unsends a boob pic ?
 Sophie .
 Oleg .
 What 's there to say about these two kids ?
 Oleg is a bad cook .
 Sophie , quite loud .
 But somehow , when they get together , magic .
 You suck , next act !
 Says the lady that works at the airport .
 And , Oleg , I 'm so glad Sophie is marrying you so now you can stay in the country .
 Oh , no .
 Uh ...
 You suck .
 Next act ?
 Yeah , I hear ya girl .
 I mean that last joke didn 't even have a punch line .
 Yeah , I mean , it was sort of sad .
 It was no joke .
 This is serious .
 It 's really serious .
 That boob pic is up in the Cloud now .
 My boob is in the Cloud , y 'all .
 Sophie , I didn 't know how to tell you .
 You wanted to marry me for a green card ?
 See , I thought you were marrying me for my bod .
 Or for my connections at The Container Store , or ...
 I mean , I taught you how to read !
 Sophie , I can explain .
 No , no , no .
 The wedding 's off .
 Oh , no .
 What the hell am I going to do with all those pigeons that I had painted wedding white ?
 Sophie , wait .
 Aww , well , look who it is .
 My dearly deported .
 I worked on that the whole way over .
 Sophie , I 'm not gonna be deported .
 I 'm gonna marry someone so I can stay in this country and win you back .
 I don 't care who my new bride is .
 Just upfront , it can 't be me .
 ' Cause everybody knows I 'm married to my work .
 And it can 't be me .
 It just can 't .
 They don 't even have to be the best or even good .
 Standards are out the window .
 Look , it 's a California Raisin .
 Ooh .
 Sunglasses and Advil .
 Last night was mad real .
 Han , will you marry me so I can stay in the country ?
 I 'll need to think about it .
 Yes .
 Apparently the only thing he won 't say yes to is health care .
 Oleg , I don 't believe you .
 This is just another trick to get me to do what you want me to do .
 Like when you kept " dropping " your ice cream into your lap .
 No trick .
 Sometimes love makes you do crazy , disgusting things .
 Like this .
 Come here , Han .
 And now I love this job , too !
 Thank God he picked Han .
 Wow , Sophie .
 Oleg must really love you .
 That had to be hard for him .
 And from what I can see , a little hard for Han , too .
 At our wedding , maybe two pumps of breath spray .
 Han , you 're not marrying Oleg .
 ' Cause Oleg 's marrying me .
 I believe you now .
 ' Cause you kissed Han , and Asian girls aren 't even your thing .
 Oh my God , Max , it 's my boob pic .
 Someone made it into a meme .
 A mammo meme ?
 You 're not supposed to need those 'til you 're 40 .
 My boob pic is gonna be hanging over me for the rest of my life .
 Oh , come on , your boob couldn 't hang over a pencil .
