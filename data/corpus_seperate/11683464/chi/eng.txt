 In the early days of the Internet , you couldn 't stream movies or summon Thai food to your doorstep .



 But ... if you were interested in text- based news about upcoming physics lectures , it was a great time to be alive .

 Holy moly .
 Dad .
 Dad !
 I 'm in the shower !
 It 's an emergency .
 Fine !
 Come in .
 Dad ?
 I thought you had to use the bathroom .
 At 7 : 23 in the morning ?
 Why do I print out schedules if you 're not going to read them ?
 Tell me what you want .
 What are we doing next weekend ?
 This ain 't sounding like an emergency .
 Stephen Hawking is giving a lecture , and I really need to go . It is .


 Can we talk about this when I 'm out of the shower ?
 Pick up the pace .
 According to the schedule that you don 't read , I 'm due in there in six minutes .




 So can we go ?
 ( SlGHS ) I don 't know .
 Go take a shower .
 I still have two minutes and 15 seconds .
 Let 's nail this down .
 Where 's the lecture ?
 And if the answer 's Dallas , we 're not going . Good news : It 's not Dallas .

 Where ? Pasadena , California .
 ( CHUCKLES ) : California ?
 That 's a lot further than Dallas .
 1, 232 miles further as the crow flies .
 But kudos to you for being up on your geography .
 There 's no way we 're going to California .
 If Stephen Hawking can make it there in a wheelchair ,
 I 'm sure we can manage .
 ( SlGHS ) : Sheldon , airplane tickets are expensive .
 Hotels are expensive .
 We can 't afford it .
 But his health is fragile .
 This might be my only chance to ever see him in person .
 I 'm sorry , buddy .
 I would like to discuss this further , but I only have ... 22 seconds to be in the shower , and buttons slow me down .
 Thisis the moment we lost that game .
 But one bad play doesn 't mean you give up .
 We had plenty of time to turn it around , but y 'all decided it was over .
 I don 't want to ever see that happen again .
 Next time something seems out of your reach , you do not quit .
 You just dig deeper .
 Does that mean if I find an affordable flight to California , we can go ?
 ( SlGHS ) ( DOOR OPENS ) Hi .
 Can I help you ?
 I 'm trying to find the cheapest flight to California for me and my father . Okay .
 Well , have a seat .
 You lookin ' to go to Disneyland ?
 The only ride I 'm interested in is the intellectual roller coaster of Stephen Hawking 's mind .
 And where is that located ?
 Well ... Stephen Hawking 's head .
 But that will be at Caltech in Pasadena .
 Got it . And , uh , when were you looking to fly ?
 Next weekend .
 Oh , wow , that 's pretty soon .
 Traveling last- minute can be pricey .
 Are there any discounts available ?
 Are you a member of any frequent- flyer programs ?
 No . I 've never flown before .
 Well , ways to keep the cost down are :
 Flying on weekdays , multiple layovers , or ...
 This probably doesn 't apply , but ...
 Airlines offer special fares if there 's been a death in the family .
 Interesting .
 May I use your phone ?
 ( PHONE RlNGS )
 Hello ?
 What else you got ?
 Hello ?
 See ya .
 Where you going ?
 Out with Jana .
 You 've been spending a lot of time with her lately .
 Is she your girlfriend ?
 Dad , can you make her stop ?
 Yeah , I could but I won 't .
 Also , I can 't .
 I just want to know what 's going on in your life .
 And if this girl is someone special to you , then she 's special to me .
 Come on .
 Mary , enough .
 What ?
 I want to know .
 Bye . If it helps , I don 't care .
 It does .
 Thank you .
 Why doesn 't he tell me anything ?
 When you were a teenager , did you tell your parents stuff ?
 Well , no .
 Then why do you expect him to ? ' Cause I 'm a cool , fun mom .
 ( SNlCKERS ) ( CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY ) Dad , good news .
 Airline tickets to California are more affordable than you think .
 Sheldon , we 're not going .
 What 's all this about ? Stephen Hawking is giving a lecture at Caltech .
 If we leave on Wednesday and are willing to make four layovers , in Boise , Denver , Albuquerque and Fargo , we can get there for only $95 each .
 I have a job ...
 I can 't just leave in the middle of the week .
 W- Well , then what about Mom ?
 Sorry , Shelly , we 're not in a position to do this .
 But Stephen Hawking 's my hero .
 Imagine if you got a chance to see Jesus or ...
 Dad got to meet the man who invented beer .
 ( SlGHS )
 Someone 's Underoos are in a knot .
 My Underoos are fitting just fine , thank you .
 Then why is there a stick up your butt ?
 Stop making inquiries about my bottom .
 But I enjoy it .
 Mom and Dad won 't take me to California to see Stephen Hawking .
 You thought they would take you to California ?
 Yes .
 They wouldn 't even buy me this book at the book fair .
 I had to get it at the library .
 There 's a booger on one of the pages .
 Well , I may never get another chance to see him in person .
 Suck it up . You always get everything you want .
 That 's not true .
 You got a computer .
 I 'm reading a booger book . Fine .
 How do you recommend I " suck it up " ?
 I don 't know , when you don 't get your way , shut up and move on .
 Is that what you do ?
 Yeah . And that 's why you don 't have a computer .
 ( SlGHS )
 Georgie is my son ...
 I have the right to know who he 's spending time with .
 You talking about Jana ?
 You know her ?
 Well , I don 't really knowher .
 I 've seen them hanging out together at Dale 's store a couple of times .
 She 's cute .
 Great . So you know even more than I do .
 ( CHUCKLES ) :
 Always have .
 ( SlGHS ) I don 't feel I 'm being out of line wanting to ... know how old this girl is or what church she goes to or her last name .
 Owens .
 ( EXHALES ) What ?
 Now you know .
 Unbelievable !
 Oh , geez , you worry about Sheldon not being normal , now you 're worried about Georgie beingnormal ...
 How did I raise such a turd ? I am not ... that word .
 If you can 't say the word , you might be the word .
 Hmm .
 ( CHUCKLES )
 Over the next few days , I tried to take my sister 's advice and " suck it up . "
 ADULT SHELDON :
 But how could I , when everything reminded me of Stephen Hawking ?
 ( IMlTATlNG ENGlNE REVVlNG )
 Hmm .
 ( GROANS ) AUTOMATED VOlCE :
 L- E- A- R- N.
 That is correct .
 Now spell ...
 Oh , dear !
 It 's actually a shampoo for ladies , but my hair just responds to it . GEORGE JR . :

 JANA :
 So , what are you doing Friday night ?
 GEORGE JR . : No plans . JANA :
 My parents are gonna be out of town .
 Really ?
 Wanna come over ?
 My parents won 't let me if your folks ain 't there .
 JANA :
 Okay .
 Uh , but I guess I don 't have to tell 'em .
 JANA : Cool . STURGlS :
 Okay , that 's it . Nothing was able to shake me from my doldrums , not even Dr. Sturgis 's jaunty new sweater- vest . ADULT SHELDON :


 Sheldon ?
 Yes ?
 You seem distracted .
 I really wanted to see Stephen Hawking speak at Caltech , but my parents can 't afford the trip .
 That 's too bad .
 Dr. H puts on a heck of a show .
 I believe it .
 Would it make you feel better to know this vest is reversible ?
 A little .
 Thanks .
 Wait . I may be able to help you with Hawking .
 Really ?
 This vest is not the only thing that 's full of surprises .
 Where ya goin ' ?
 Out .
 Out where ?
 Jana 's .
 Her parents gonna be there ?
 Yep . Okay .
 Let me just call and make sure . Owens . Owens .
 That 's her last name , right ?
 Owens ?
 Why are you being so weird ? I 'm not being weird .

 Are you ?
 No .
 Good .
 No one 's being weird .
 Don 't call 'em .
 Why not ?
 Why can 't you just trust me ?
 ( EXHALES )
 Because I know that you 're lying .
 What ?
 No , I 'm not . I heard you on the phone with Jana .
 You spied on me ?
 I didn 't mean to , but I 'm glad that I did , because you just lied to my face .
 You are not going anywhere .
 Try and stop me . You walk out that door , and your father gets involved .
 I don 't need this .
 ( DOOR SLAMS )
 Dang .

 Dad .
 You missed everything .
 What happened ?
 Georgie lied to Mom to be alone at Jana 's house , but Mom knew 'cause she listened in on his phone call .
 Oh , boy .
 Now he 's grounded and everyone 's mad .
 Not me .
 I 'm super happy .
 Well ... bye . Dad , the university offered to pay for us to go to California !
 They 're even putting us up in a hotel .
 You 're kidding .
 We 're going to California ?
 No , just me and Dad .

 That 's fair .
 I 'm so happy for you . ADULT SHELDON :
 Sometimes sarcasm was laid on so thick even I could detect it .
 Thanks ! ADULT SHELDON :
 This was not one of those times .
 I see .
 Well , no , that makes sense .
 Okay , John , thanks .
 Bye .
 Sheldon was right .
 They 're offerin ' to pay for the whole trip .
 Why ?
 Sturgis talked to his boss , and they really want to keep Sheldon goin ' to school there .
 I guess I could take him .
 Why you ?
 He asked me first .
 I 'm mad at Georgie right now .
 It 'd be good for us to have some space .
 So , you pick a fight with Georgie , and I don 't get to go to California ?
 ( HUFFS ) Fine , you can go .
 Thank you .
 Have fun managing Sheldon 's bathroom schedule in different time zones .
 Let me get a picture of my boys before their big trip .
 It 's smart to document this .
 Next time you see me , I 'll have been in the presence of Stephen Hawking .
 Smile .
 I 'd prefer to look serious .
 This may appear in a textbook someday .
 Say , " Stephen Hawking . "
 Stephen Hawking .
 Stephen Hawking . SHELDON :
 Aw , you made me smile .
 ( SPORTSCASTER SPEAKlNG INDlSTlNCTLY ON TV )
 Wash up for dinner .
 I ain 't eatin ' .
 Well , you 're not watchin ' TV .
 I can 't leave the house , and now I can 't watch TV .
 Yeah , it 's called being grounded .
 I can 't wait to move out .
 What was that ? !
 Next time , I 'll say it on the phone , so you can hear me .
 ( DOO- WOP MUSlC PLAYlNG ON RADlO )
 You keep frownin ' like that , you 're gonna get wrinkles
 like your meemaw .
 You look great .
 I know , I just wanted to hear you say it .
 What 's on your mind ?
 Sheldon always gets everything he wants .
 I guess he does .
 That 's not fair , huh ?
 No !
 On the other hand , he 's just going to some science lecture .
 I know , but he gets to go on a plane to California .
 Planes aren 't all that great .
 You can 't even smoke on 'em anymore .
 I tell you what , after practice today , you and me will do somethin ' fun .
 Can I have my first cigarette ?
 No !
 Can I get my ears pierced ?
 Your mom won 't like that .
 So , maybe .
 ( SlNGERS VOCALlZING ON RADlO )
 All right , 34A and B ...
 This is us .
 All right , you want the aisle or the window ?
 Which one is assigned to me ?
 It doesn 't matter , just pick one .
 Well , if I sit by the window , I can watch the takeoff and landing , but if I sit on the aisle ,
 I 'm closer to the bathroom .
 Here we go .
 Although if I 'm by the window , you 'll have to get up when I use the bathroom .
 But if I 'm not , I 'll have to get up when youuse the bathroom .
 Just pick one .
 It 's a tricky decision .
 My bladder 's smaller than yours ...
 Everything okay here ?
 About to be .
 Here !
 ( EXCLAlMS ) Aisle it is !
 ( CHUCKLES ) We 're good .
 Oh , okay .
 You want to help me with this ?
 No .
 Hey ! You 're the one who lied to me .
 Well , I 'm done talkin ' to you , so it 'll never happen again .
 ( KNOCKlNG )
 What ?
 I know you don 't want to talk , and that 's fine .
 You can just listen .
 ( SlGHS ) Life is hard enough if you make good decisions , but if you make bad ones , it gets even harder .
 Nothin ' was gonna happen with Jana .
 Georgie ...
 No ! You always assume the worst with me .
 I 'm sorry you were a perfect kid and I 'm just a screwup .
 You are not a screwup .
 ( SlGHS ) And I was not a perfect kid .
 Oh , what 'd you do , sleep through church one mornin ' ?
 For your information ...
 I used to skip class ... so that I could drink beer in my boyfriend 's truck .
 Dad had a truck back then ?
 Not talkin ' about your dad .
 Whoa .
 I also ... stole your meemaw 's car and crashed it into a ditch .

 Really ?
 With that boyfriend who wasn 't Dad ?
 Missin ' the point !
 If the point is you made some bad decisions and turned out fine , then why you being so hard on me ?
 Because some decisions you cannot walk away from and they will affect the rest of your life .
 If you 're talkin ' about Jana getting pregnant , she ain 't gonna .
 That is what I thought , and the next thing I know ,
 I 'm at the courthouse gettin ' married .
 You got married because you were pregnant ?
 Yes .
 So , I was a mistake ?
 No !
 No !
 ( GROANS ) You are a blessin ' .
 The mistake was lyin ' to my parents , so that I could spend the night at your dad 's house .
 And , you know , tequila . Ladies and gentlemen , this is your captain speaking .
 We 're expecting a smooth flight to Los Angeles .
 Before we take off , please direct your attention to the flight attendants as they review some important safety procedures .
 " Safety procedures " ?
 Oh , baby .
 FLlGHT ATTENDANT :
 Take a minute to locate the exit closest to you .
 The nearest exit could be behind you .
 Should the cabin experience sudden pressure loss , oxygen masks will drop down from above your seat ...
 Why would the cabin lose pressure ?
 It won 't . Place the mask over your mouth and nose ,
 like this , pull the strap to tighten it .
 If you are traveling with children , make sure that your own mask is on first before helping your child ...
 I don 't like this at all .
 It 's just a precaution . You know ... perfectly safe .
 FLlGHT ATTENDANT : In the unlikely event of a water landing and evacuation ... ( HEART BEATlNG ) ( ECHOlNG ) :
 Water landing , water landing , water landing ...
 I can 't do this .
 ( BUCKLE CLlCKlNG )
 Keep going , we 'll be right back .
 Uh , sir ? !
 Sheldon , come out of there !
 No ! At least open the door .
 Tell them I need to get off .
 FLlGHT ATTENDANT :
 Sir ? You both need to return to your seats .
 Just one second .
 Sir . Sir ...
 If you want to see Stephen Hawking , we have to sit down right now .
 It 's too dangerous .
 I can 't !
 It 's okay to be scared .
 Sir ?
 Th- That 's when you got to dig deep and be brave .
 ( POUNDlNG ON DOOR ) So , what do you say ?
 No , I 'm your terrified little boy !
 Okay .
 ( POUNDlNG ON DOOR ) Sir , please , they 're gonna call security !
 Just one more second .
 Mr. Spock !
 He flies around all the time in that spaceship .
 He 's not afraid , is he ?
 I 'm not Mr. Spock .
 No , but- but I 've seen you pretend to be him .
 Could you do that right now ?
 You be Spock , I 'll be Kirk .
 ( SlGHS ) Maybe .
 Okay , Mr. Spock .
 Your first order is to return to your seat .
 Aye , Captain .
 CAPTAlN : Flight attendants , prepare for takeoff .
 You okay , Mr. Spock ?
 Doing my best , sir .
 ( ENGlNES ROAR )
 The captain and Mr. Spock don 't hold hands .
 Sorry .
 Okay , maybe just this once .
 ( STAR TREKTHEME PLAYlNG )

 I think we 've been lied to about California .
 No one on this campus is tan at all .
 No , they are not .
 Imagine all the stimulating conversations that must go on at these tables .
 I bet .
 I can see myself going here one day .
 I think you 'd fit right in .
