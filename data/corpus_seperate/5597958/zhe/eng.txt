 [ Tires squeal , engine revs ]




 Dean :
 How many missing you have ?
 Six , all in the last 48 hours . They 're disappearing one by one .
 Okay , uh , let 's start with Libby Strauss .
 I understand that she was from out of town .
 Uh , she and a friend were visiting from Tucson .
 Libby was the first reported missing . But all the rest have been local ?

 All residents .
 You got any leads ?
 The only eyewitness I have is the friend .
 Not the most reliable source .
 Why is that ?
 She and Libby were on the last legs of their cannabis tasting tour .

 Have you had anything odd like this happen around here before ?

 [ Sighs ]
 27 years ago .
 About a dozen residents went missing .
 27 years before another 8 disappeared .
 All within the same time frame ?
 Couple days ? Same time of year , too .
 And how far back do the disappearances go ?
 That 's it . The town 's only been here since the '50s .
 It was all virgin forest till they found coal here .
 So then how do people explain the missing ?
 Mostly they don 't .
 People come and go in this town .
 I 've only been here two years , myself .
 There are some old- timers with their theories .
 Such as ?
 Town 's built on an Indian burial ground .
 Forest folk are pissed because we stole their coal . And what 's your take ? We 're a small town .
 People get bored , they get fed up , they leave .

 Once a few get free , it 's like a jail break .
 Encourages the others . Every 27 years like clockwork ?

 Honestly , I- I 'm just focused on the missing that I have right now .

 The thing that took Libby was naked and pale .
 Except for the eyes .
 I swear to God , they flashed green for a second .
 And it didn 't have any hair .
 Anywhere .
 It was shaped like a man .


 Or was it a woman ?
 Was it a man or a woman ?
 It didn 't have a ... A penis ? It didn 't have anything .

 What happened ?

 [ Hisses and growls ]
 [ Screams ] It wasn 't Libby .

 I don 't know what it was .
 The buzzing ... was coming from her body ?
 We heard the same sound right before that thing jumped out at us .

 Weed alone doesn 't conjure up that kind of scenario .

 Eh . Dude , that 's a new low , even for us .
 Well , something happened . You got the eyes , the buzzing .
 Yeah , I know you 're right .
 That can 't be a coincidence .
 Uh , here , I found this .
 The , uh , the sheriff who was here in '89 , Cochran .
 Those are his notes .
 There 's no mention of buzzing .
 But he seemed to be closing in on some of the missing , and then his notes , they just kind of abruptly stop .
 He take a flyer , too ?
 No .
 He remained sheriff for a few more months .
 He ended up resigning and , uh , then he fell off the radar . I asked around the station , but that was a few sheriffs ago .
 So ...
 Nothing ? The dispatcher said she thought he moved to Florida , but that was a dead end .
 Kind of like this case .
 Yeah . [ Telephone rings in distance ]
 Wait a second . [ Papers rustle ]
 Most of the witnesses in '89 and '62 , they 're all dead or they 've moved away , but there does seem to be one holdout from the '89 case .
 Etta Fraser .
 Let 's go talk to Etta . Your husband was one of the people who disappeared in 1989 .
 Oh , my second husband . Barely that . [ Chuckles ]
 Pete only stuck around a couple months .
 So he left voluntarily ? Oh .
 [ Chuckles ]
 Pete was volunteering himself all over the place .
 Right before he disappeared , people saw Pete diddling two different women separate occasions .
 You mean they actually saw him in the act ?
 What does " diddling " mean to you ?
 Uh , Pete was never a showman , but apparently , Doris Kagen and Missy Petersen brought out the hog in him .

 Doris and Melissa -- uh , Missy -- they disappeared that year , too .

 Oh , yeah . Surprise , surprise .
 I 'd bet my mortgage Pete ran off with one of 'em .
 But you reported him as missing .
 Well , he didn 't come home for three days .
 I thought he was dead in a ditch somewhere .
 We didn 't find out about the women for a long time after .

 I 'm going to stay with my sister a few weeks .
 For any reason ? You 're gonna think it 's real out there .
 Well , you 'd be surprised at the kind of crazy we hear .
 Well ... when Pete went missing , and we found out about the women , my grandma said that he " got the chitters . "
 According to her , once a generation around the spring equinox , people in town start going nuts , having orgies , copulating in the woods .


 And then they disappear , never to be heard from again .
 Well , that 's certainly one explanation for Pete .
 [ Chuckles ]
 I never really , um , believed what she said , but ... now people are disappearing again .

 She always said burn sage to protect yourself .
 Hmm . So why did she call it " the chitters " ?
 Oh , that was the word Gran used to describe the sound coming from the woods when the orgies were happening .
 Yeah , kind of a buzzing , rattling .
 Did your Gran ever mention something about , uh , green eyes ?
 Oh , yeah .
 Gran said that if you got the chitters , you get so revved up with lust that your eyes would shine like emeralds . ♪

 It 's a kind of cicada spirit .
 We couldn 't find any lore on 'em .
 They 're rare , at least in America .
 People think that they originated in Malaysia in the forests there .
 [ Door opens ]
 So what are they doing here ?
 What they always do .
 [ Door closes ] Every 27 years , they come up from underground , they mate like crazy for a few days .

 That generation dies off , and the whole cycle goes on repeat .
 So they 're reproducing ?
 But we 're -- we 're dealing with townsfolk here .
 I mean , they didn 't just crawl out of a hole a few days ago .
 This is what surfaces .
 Bisaan can 't reproduce on their own , so they take over a human body to do the deed .
 They enter through the mouth , like a hermit crab climbing into a shell .
 Only they don 't care that the shell 's not empty .
 Well , that explains Junkless .
 What about the buzzing ?
 It 's how they communicate .
 It 's a mating call .
