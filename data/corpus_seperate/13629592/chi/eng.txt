 I 've been accepted into the Garden Club .
 You shouldn 't be here .
 I was invited . I- I 'm the new member .
 No , we- we voted .
 Oh , dear .
 I am so terribly sorry for the mix- up .
 Rita deliberately humiliated me today .
 Is that Rita ?
 - Do you know her ? - What Rita did ...
 It 's not 'cause she hates you .
 - It 's 'cause she hates me .
 Good morning , it 's Dr. Rice .
 Are you aware you 're pregnant ?
 I 'm his girl .
 - Is that so ? - Yeah .
 You murdered 26 people ? !
 You 've got to stop this madness . Promise me .
 I think this is what Alma was
 - talking to me about . - Listen to her .
 Why are you so anxious to spend time with an old lady like me ?
 You 're a dame who doesn 't know how beautiful she is .
 Oh , Papa , you must be getting your strength back .
 I think he 's pointing at something .
 He couldn 't possibly .
 Is there something on the board ?
 Oh !
 Ah ! You can trust me with your secrets .
 You and Scooter .
 No one will hear a word about it from me .
 Threaten me again , and this will be your family .
 From the moment Alma Fillcot decided to join the Elysian Park Garden Club , she began to change .
 But her husband was completely oblivious to her stylish transformation .
 He had no idea she 'd begun to polish her nails .
 He had not noticed how elegantly she was wearing her hair .
 And he paid no attention to her new shade of lipstick .
 It was unfortunate .
 If Bertram had noticed these changes in Alma he might have been prepared for what happened next .
 Shall I take you straight to the clinic ? Yes , yes .
 I have an early appointment .
 Hmm . Very well .
 Since we have a moment , there is something that I would like to discuss .
 Well , what 's that ?
 - Your little hobby .
 - Ah .
 - Hmm .
 - That 's funny .
 ' Cause I 've been doing some thinking about that myself .
 You know , I regret some of the words that I 've hurled at you in the last few weeks .
 Sick , psychopathic , demented .
 You were only trying to alleviate the suffering of some people who were already dying .
 I see now that you 're a hero .
 I 'm con ... I 'm confused .
 I couldn 't comprehend it before because I didn 't know any of those people .
 But now I understand , because I 'm aware of someone who is desperately in need of the kind of help that only you can supply .



 Wh ...
 What are you saying ?
 There 's someone that you want me to ... Oh , yes .


 And you 'd be doing God 's work , my love . My hero .


 Who exactly are we talking about ?
 You know Rita Castillo ?
 She came to our house with the Garden Club ?
 Yes . Yes , I treat her cat . - Mm- hmm .
 - Is she ill ?
 Oh , no .
 No , but , um she has a husband .
 His name is Carlo and he 's in so much pain .
 Yes , Alma Fillcot had truly changed .
 But by the time her husband could see it it was too late .

 At the exact same moment
 Alma Fillcot was asking her husband to kill Carlo Castillo , his wife was doing some diabolical plotting of her own .
 Phone for you , Mrs. Castillo .
 - Hello ? - Hey , gorgeous .
 - It 's me . - It 's about time you called .
 How 'd your date go with you know who ?
 - Swell , if I do say so myself . - Good .
 Because I need you to screw her ... tonight .
 Tonight ?
 Carlo is starting to communicate .
 He even tried to warn Catherine about you .
 I need that compromising photo as soon as possible .
 She 's a church- going spinster .
 She 's not going put out on the second date .
 Well , then get her drunk . Tell her you love her .
 I don 't care how you do it , just ...
 Just , just make it happen .
 Goodbye .
 You ended that call awfully fast .
 Who was it ?
 Your secret lover ?
 For a woman who dresses like a nun , you certainly have a filthy mind .
 Hello ?
 Oh .
 It 's for you .
 - Hello ? - Hey , Catherine . It 's me .
 You got any plans tonight ?
 I thought maybe we could grab some dinner .
 It would be lovely to see you , but I 'm busy tonight .
 What about tomorrow night ?
 You can 't say no to that .
 It 's , uh ... my birthday ?
 Well ...
 I- I don 't want you to be alone on your birthday .
 So , shall we say 6 : 00 ?
 It 's a date .
 Are you serious ?
 You really want me to kill Carlo Castillo ?
 I- I want you to help him .
 Isn 't that the term you prefer ?
 Yes , and every time I 've used it , you 've corrected me .
 So , what 's changed ?
 Well , I saw him for myself .
 He can 't move or feed himself or bathe .
 When did you see him ?
 Last night , at Rita 's .
 Sounds like you two have grown close .
 Oh , yes .
 She 's become a good chum .
 Did she get you into the Garden Club ?
 Rita tried .
 The other ladies voted for Ada Coy .
 Ah , Alma .
 - I 'm so sorry . - It 's fine .
 I only wanted to get in so that I could make some new friends , and now I have .
 Rita 's really gone out of her way to be kind to me , even while dealing with a crippled husband .
 Did she come to you about this ?
 Why would she ?
 It 's not as if I go around advertising your services .
 So ... you 'll help him ?
 Alma .
 While I was away on my trip ,
 I had a bit of an epiphany .
 An epiphany ?
 I realized I 'd only been ending the suffering of others to ease my own pain .
 My actions were more selfish than merciful .
 So I vowed to never do it again .
 And you won 't .
 After you help Carlo , you 'll put away your trusty syringes forever .
 I 'm sorry , Alma . The answer is no .
 I should go .
 Bertram !
 We 're not done discussing this .
 Alma , my mind is made up .
 There 's nothing you can do to change it .
 Hey , Dee . Hey .
 Thanks for meeting me . Come here .
 I- Is something wrong ?
 Is everything all right ?
 You sounded so strange on the phone .
 Yeah .
 I 've gotten myself into a situation .
 Okay , well , we- we can go somewhere and we can
 - talk about it , right ? - Oh , I can 't .
 And I 'm really sorry to spring this on you .
 I , I like you so much .
 More than you know , but we can 't see each other anymore .
 Why not ?
 I can 't say .
 Did I do something ?
 Oh , God , no .
 This has nothing to do with you . I promise .
 Well , whatever it is , we- we can talk about it .
 Like we always do .
 You 're such a good guy , Vern .
 And I think you deserve all the happiness in the world .
 Wait , Dee .
 Dee !
 Oh , hello there .
 Hey , Grace .
 What a surprise .
 What is going on ?
 Oh , I just thought my garden could use a little spiffing up .
 Oh , yeah , well , I understand .
 New projects help us take our minds off our troubles .
 Oh . Well , that 's not the only new project I 'm working on .
 Hmm ?
 Believe you me . Tea ?
 I still don 't know why Rita treated you so badly .
 I asked all the ladies in the club if they knew something I didn 't .
 Any theories ?
 No .
 But she 's always been a very unhappy person . - Mm .
 - Not surprised ,
 - given who she 's married to . - What does that mean ?
 Apparently ,
 Carlo was something of an ogre .
 Before he had the stroke , he used to beat Rita .
 - That is just awful . - Mm- hmm .
 Please ... go on .
 Look at that .
 It 's been ages since you baked a cherry pie .
 Yes , well ,
 I wanted to do something special to apologize for this morning .
 Oh , when you asked me to help Carlo ?
 Yes .
 You see , I- I wasn 't completely honest with you .
 I held back some important details .
 That was wrong of me . I 'm sorry .
 What details are you referring to ?
 Well the truth is , I don 't care about Carlo at all .
 In fact , I think he deserves every bit of pain that he 's in .
 Well , if that 's the way you feel , why would you want me to hasten his death ?
 Because I care about Rita .
 Oh , Bertie .
 Carlo is an awful man .
 He used to beat her . Savagely .
 Rita wept when she spoke of his cruelty .
 That 's horrible .
 Thank God he can 't hurt her anymore .
 Yes , but now she has to take care of him .
 And can you imagine ?
 Being forced to nurse your tormentor ?
 She 's so unhappy .
 Drinking and neglecting her own health .
 I fear that she might die before Carlo does .
 That poor woman .
 But you could help her .
 Oh , Bertram .
 You want to . I know you do .
 You can 't ignore that kind of suffering .
 All I 'm asking for is one final act of mercy .
 Please .
 Save my friend .
 All right .
 I 'll do it .
 Oh ...
 Bless you , Bertie .
 You know what would be nice on this pie ?
 - Some ice cream . - Mm .
 - Sounds delicious . - Doesn 't it ?
 Mmm .
 Are you glad to be back ?
 You know I am .
 Ah , hey , look .
 It 's our old pal Mr. Murphy .
 Oh . I forgot there was a fire escape here .
 This is the perfect place for my photographer to hide .
 I hope he 's patient .
 It 's going to take a lot of booze during dinner to get Catherine back here for dessert .
 You may want to knock a few back yourself .
 You 'll have to be drunk to jump those old bones .
 She 's not so bad .
 Excuse me ?
 Oh , I thought she was an old pickle- puss at first , but once she lets her guard down , she 's actually got a really nice smile .
 And she 's only ... what ?
 Five years older than you ?
 You know this seduction doesn 't have to end in consummation .
 Aw , I thought that was the whole point .
 No . The photo is the point .
 Once Catherine is naked and on her back , you 'll have hit the high note .
 No need to sing the entire opera .
 You 're jealous .
 Of her ?
 Don 't be preposterous .
 You know , I have missed this old murphy bed .
 What do you say we rechristen it ? Why ?
 So I have nothing left in the tank for Catherine ?
 How devious do you think I am ?
 You 've been to the gym this morning , haven 't you ?
 Oh , what gave it away , the muscles ?
 No , the smell .
 You need a shower .
 Oh .
 Well , give me five .
 And- and keep the motor running .
 You the manager here ?
 I 'm looking for a guy who lived in 3B .
 I thought maybe he left a forwarding address where he can be reached .
 You talking about Scooter ?
 He moved back in this morning .
 He did ?
 Oh .
 Ah .
 Well , thanks .
 Oh , it 's you .
 Is Scooter here ?
 I thought you were done with him .
 Something 's happened .
 And it 's very important I speak to him .
 Please .
 Oh , my God . You 're pregnant .
 You can tell ?
 Oh , it 's all over your face .
 That and some fairly cheap makeup .
 Nice .
 Oh , before I forget , I have a message for you from my mom .
 You get all that ?
 Or do I need to repeat it ?
 You know what ?
 I 'll come back later when Scoot can talk .
 Are you , uh , sure you want to tell him ?
 How can I not ?
 It 's his baby .
 Well , what are you hoping for ?
 That he 'll tell you he loves you ?
 Because he doesn 't .
 And what if he decides to do the right thing and marry you ?
 You 'd have two infants to take care of instead of one .
 Scooter is not ready to be a father .
 Or a husband .
 Hell , he can barely cut it as a boyfriend .
 I do not want to marry Scooter .
 But I don 't got a lot of choices here .
 You 'll think of something .
 You 're too smart to let one stupid mistake ruin the rest of your life .
 Congrats .
 He 's all yours .
 Thank you .
 You know , if you need some money ...
 Who was that at the door ?
 Just a door- to- door salesman .
 What were they selling ?
 Nothing we need .
 Mmm .
 - Delicious .
 - Hmm . You made my cocoa just the way I like it .
 Thank you , my darling .
 You 're very welcome , Bertie .
 Say , how are you at housebreaking ?
 What 's that ?
 You know , picking locks and all that ?
 I think it 's best if you visit Carlo
 late at night when everyone 's asleep .
 But have you ever broken into a locked house before ?
 Well , I mean , usually , when I drop in on someone to help them , they just open the door .
 Unless they 're too ill to get up , and then I find a way in .
 You 're so clever .
 Now , it is a very , very big house .
 And so , I have made you a map .
 Oh .
 Many is the time I could have used one of these . Yes .
 So , Carlo 's room is here .
 Up the stairs , take a right .
 Last one on the left , not the right .
 - That 's Rita 's bedroom .
 - Right .
 Now , the front door is very , very solid , but if you come around the back , there are French doors that lead into the foyer .
 - Is that easier ? - Oh , much .
 Hmm .
 Now , will you have to break the glass ? No .
 No . I can 't leave any signs of forced entry .
 I 'd just be asking for an autopsy .
 And if the police did do an autopsy , would they find the drug that you use ?
 They 'd have to be looking for it .
 And they wouldn 't be unless they suspected foul play .
 - Hmm .
 - And it 's never happened .
 My record is spotless .
 26 deaths , each ruled to be by natural causes .
 - That 's quite an accomplishment . - Oh , thank you , darling .
 You know , it seems odd getting compliments for something I hid from you for many years .
 I think it 's good that I know these things .
 Makes our marriage stronger .
 Yes , it does .
 - Yes .
 Mmm .
 Mmm .
 You want me to photograph your lover screwing your stepdaughter ?
 If you try hard enough , you can make anything sound sordid .
 Boy , you are a piece of work .
 This is completely justified .
 That crone has had it in for me since day one .
 I have to fight back .
 By using your own gigolo as bait ?
 It 's not like he hasn 't cheated on me before .
 At least he won 't get this one pregnant .
 Pregnant ?
 Remember that large girl he was seeing ?
 She showed up at his place today to give him the bad news .
 The ... the waitress ?
 She 's having a baby ?
 I convinced her not to tell Scooter .
 She 's not so dumb that she can 't see he 'd make a lousy father .
 So , if you 're not going to take the photo , can you refer someone who will ?
 Did I say I wouldn 't do it ?
 You haven 't even made me an offer yet .
 Oh .
 So , your disgust can be overcome for the right price ?
 Some days money doesn 't mean a lot to me .
 Lucky for you , this isn 't one of them .
 That 's it . Open up and chew slowly .
 Catherine .
 Your friend from the dry cleaner is downstairs .
 Thanks .
 Do you want one more fry before I leave , Papa ?
 What 's wrong ?
 Are you full ?
 Why are you mad ?
 Because I 'm going out for dinner ?
 That 's silly .
 I need to start enjoying my life .
 You know , I 'm not 23 anymore .
 I 'll vouch for that .
 I won 't be too late .
 I 'll tuck you in when I come home . Hmm ?
 She 's going to have sex tonight .
 With a man you don 't approve of .
 If you hadn 't threatened to disinherit her ,
 I wouldn 't have anything to blackmail her with .
 But now I can scare her all the way back to Texas .
 And then it 's just you and me .
 Doesn 't that sound like fun ?
 I hear this is their best chianti .
 But why buy the whole bottle ?
 We won 't be able to drink it all .
 Oh , we got to try .
 It 's my birthday .
 That 's right .
 I almost forgot .
 - Oh , you got me a gift ? - Just a small token , really .
 Those are real diamonds .
 Catherine .
 This is too expensive . No .
 Didn 't cost me a cent .
 I bought them years ago for another man .
 Do you like them ?
 I love them .
 I 'm so glad .
 This is shaping up to be my best birthday ever .
 Oh .

 So I don 't get expensive gifts for Papa anymore because I know they 're going to end up going to Rita .
 Now , that 's your stepmother ?
 I guess you never liked her , huh ?
 Well , actually , we used to be friends , right when she and Papa got engaged .
 She was nice back then .
 But right after the wedding , that 's when Rita showed her true colors .
 - She wasn 't so nice anymore ?
 - Mm .
 No . You see ...
 Rita can be sweet as pie as long as she needs you , but once she no longer needs you ...
 You 're out on your ass .
 I should powder my nose .
 Excuse me .
 You want to hurry it up , Romeo ?
 It 's almost midnight .
 You must be the guy Rita hired to take the photo .
 And I hope I 'm doing my job half as well as you 're doing yours .
 Excuse me ?
 I 've been watching you work .
 If I didn 't already know the plan ,
 I 'd swear you had a yen for that broad .

 He left it for Catherine to find .
 Yeah .
 She told him she 'd check on him when she gets home tonight .
 I 'm just glad you found it first .
 What are we going to do ?
 Well , we need to keep him away from all lawyers and condiments .
 This is no joke .
 I 'm worried .
 Once we have the photo , Catherine will go back home .
 Trust me .
 She does not want to be disinherited .
 So , what if we get rid of her ?
 Carlo heard you with Scooter the night he fell .
 If he tells someone he wants a divorce ...
 And how 's he going to do that ?
 He can 't talk .
 For now .
 What if he gets his voice back ?
 Wh- What , what if he gets to a phone when one of us isn 't looking ?
 We might not know until a lawyer shows up with divorce papers .
 Then what ?
 Well , then I 'm screwed .
 Not just you .
 If you lose your home , I lose mine , too .
 Let 's not panic .
 Once Catherine is gone , it 'll just be the three of us in this house , and we can watch him like a hawk .
 Sedate him if we have to .
 Or
 We can kill him .
 Isabel .
 We 've gotten away with it before .
 Are you ready ?
 Why are you dressed like that ?
 Isn 't it obvious ?
 I 'm going with you .
 No , no . That wasn 't part of the plan .
 It 's far too risky .
 What 's risky is sending you into Rita 's house without a lookout .
 I won 't go inside .
 I 'll stay in the car and keep watch , just in case .
 Well , I suppose that 'll be all right .
 Now , don 't forget your coat .
 It 's chilly out .
 We can 't have you catching your death .
 What ?
 It 's just nice to know that you still worry about me .
 Makes me feel like we 're back to normal .
 Of course we 're back to normal .
 I think I saw your coat on a chair in the kitchen .
 - Go get it .
 - Yes .

 - Dee .
 I 've been meaning to call you .
 How are you doing ? Everything okay ?
 Not really . You got a minute ?
 Look around .
 I got all the time in the world .
 What 's up ?
 You remember last summer ?
 You told me about your predicament .
 Well ...
 It seems I 'm now in the same boat .
 No .
 Have you told your parents ?
 No .
 I 'm thinking maybe they won 't need to know .
 If I do what you did .
 Remember , I had no choice .
 My folks would have disowned me .
 And the guy I was seeing was married , so ...
 Tell me about the place you went .
 St. Anne 's ?
 It was nice .
 They took good care of me .
 What was it like ?
 When you gave birth ?
 The doctors gave me something for the pain , so it 's a bit hazy .
 I remember one of the nuns said not to look at the baby when it came out .
 That it would be too painful .
 But I looked anyway .
 It was a boy .
 He looked just like me . I think .
 They took him away so quick .
 Do you know what happened to him ?
 My little guy was adopted by a family in Utah .
 They got money , a big house with a yard .
 It makes me feel good knowing he traded up .
 Ever think about him ?
 What do you think ?
 But the good news is ,
 I graduate secretarial school in May , and my folks will be there to cheer me on .
 No . I made the right decision .
 It 's getting late .
 I should go .
 If you do decide to go to St. Anne 's , can I give you some advice ?
 Sure .
 Listen to the nuns .
 Don 't look at it .
 I 'm telling you , it 's the only way to protect yourself .
 You don 't think I 've thought about killing Carlo before ?
 I came this close to drowning him in the tub last month .
 Then why didn 't you ?
 It 's not worth the risk .
 I say it is .
 We shot Harry . Look how that paid off .
 Elysian Park is not Galveston .
 And Carlo 's not some violent brute no one will miss .
 I 'm not saying we shoot him .
 There are poisons we could buy .
 Something undetectable .
 Yeah , and if the police get suspicious ?
 Then we run , like before .
 - We change our names .
 - No . I don 't want to change my identity again .
 I 've spent the last ten years perfecting this one .
 Ooh , God .
 My head is spinning .
 Oh .
 You 're drunk .
 We 're not going to solve this tonight .
 We can talk about it tomorrow .
 Just promise me , no matter what happens , you won 't leave me .
 I promise . I won 't .
 Good .
 I love you , Isabel .
 I love you too , cousin .
 There 's still a light on upstairs .
 That 's Rita 's dressing room .
 Let 's hope she 's not a night owl .
 Are you hungry ?
 I brought us some snacks and cocoa .
 The taking of a human life is a grave and sacred task .
 It 's not a night at the drive- in .
 This isn 't frivolous .
 You know how you get when your blood sugar drops .
 Yes . I 'm sorry .
 I 'm a bit nervous about Carlo .
 I 'm just not sure what his reaction will be .
 He 'll probably be a bit scared .
 He might be a little bit startled at first .
 But , you know , you have such a warm smile .
 I 'm sure you 'll put him right at ease .
 Thank you , Alma .
 I 'm glad you 're here to tell me that .
 Me , too .
 Chocolate chip cookie ?
 Oh , go on then , just one .
 Yes .
 I had a lovely evening , Scooter .
 Oh , does it have to be over ?
 We could swing by my place for a nightcap .
 Oh , I had too much to drink already .
 I 'm not sure I can trust myself .
 Don 't you trust me ?
 Even less .
 It 's been wonderful , but I do think you need to take me home now .
 Ah ...
 Ah , hang on a sec . I ... I- I think
 - I left something at the table . - Okay .
 Change of plans .
 She wants me to take her home .
 Are you calling it off ?
 What am I supposed to do ?
 Drag her back to my place ?
 Rita expects a photo in the morning .
 How do you think she 'll react if we don 't deliver ?
 Oh , geez .
 Okay .
 Follow me back to Rita 's place .
 I 'll try to get something started there .
 It 's off . Rita 's light is off .
 Here we go . Wish me luck .
 When you get into Carlo 's room , just give me a signal
 Here .
 - through the window .
 - Why ?
 So I know that you made it upstairs safely .
 Just shine your flashlight out the window .
 - Oh .
 - All right ? Yeah , okay .
 Bye . Good luck .
 And if anything happens downstairs , let me know .
 How will I do that ?
 Honk the horn .
 We 're having quite an adventure , aren 't we ?
 Yes . We 're like Bonnie and Clyde .
 - But with cookies .
 - Yes .
 You 're awake .
 I 'm sorry to startle you .
 I 'm not sure if you 'll remember me .
 I 'm Dr. Fillcot .
 Your vet .
 What ?
 I know you 're in a great deal of pain .
 And I 'm here to relieve you of your suffering .
 Perhaps we 'll start with a sedative .
 Boy . How about that wind ?
 I think a storm is coming .
 My hair is frightful .
 Make yourself at home .
 I 'll only be a moment .
 Did you hear something ?
 You said , " Make yourself at home . "
 Scooter , really .
 I 'm old enough to be your mother .
 You 're never too old to have fun .
 Why do you want to have fun with me ?
 Let 's face it .
 I 'm not a great beauty .
 I 'm lonely , okay ?
 You seem like you 're lonely , too .
 Yes .
 I am lonely .
 And rich .
 If having money means you can 't trust anyone , that you can 't accept love when offered then what good is it ?
 There 's no need to be frightened .
 It 'll all be over so soon .
 I want your last moments to be serene .
 - And beautiful .
 Oh .
 Did the lightning startle you ?
 I 'm so sorry .
 So , you really like me ?
 Of course I do .
 You 're the nicest person I 've met in this town .
 I 'm not that nice .
 Come on .
 You 're a doll .
 You treat me like I 'm somebody , and the sweet way you take care of your dad .
 Oh , I hate my papa .
 Even more since I met you .
 You make me remember everything he took from me .
 When I still had something to offer .
 I know what it feels like to think you 've missed the boat .
 That it 's too late to get what you want .
 Maybe it is .
 Or maybe it isn 't .
 Bertram .
 Alma , what are you doing ?
 There are two people downstairs . I don 't know who they are .
 Why didn 't you honk the horn ?
 I did . You must just not have heard it . Oh .
 Is it done ?
 Yes , his suffering has ended .
 Which is more than can be said for mine .
 That old man grabbed me .
 Will you stop complaining .
 We need to get out of here . Come on .
 There were two people talking in the living room earlier .
 A man and a woman .
 Well , they 're not talking now .
 Are they there ?
 Shh .
 Maybe the wind will distract them .
 They don 't need any more distracting . Come on .

 Rise and shine , Papa .
 The clouds are gone .
 It 's a glorious day , Papa .
 Papa ?
 Papa !
 We have to talk .
 Yeah . Yeah , I 'd like to talk .
 I 'm ashamed of how I left things .
 Now , just forget about it .
 No , I have to explain .
 The truth is , I ...
 I 'm in so much trouble .
 And lately it 's felt like you 're my best friend in the world .
 So , I 'm back .
 Because I trust you to give me good advice .
 See , the ...
 The thing I couldn 't tell you was ...
 You 're pregnant .
 How ?
 I am a detective .
 Oh , Vern .
 What am I gonna do ?
 Here 's a thought .
 Marry me .
 What ?
 Look , if you 're just trying to be a good guy here ...
 No .
 That 's not what this is .
 But you 'd be raising another man 's baby .
 With the woman I love .
 Oh , Vern .
 Are you absolutely sure ?
 Oh , yeah .
 I 've given it a lot of thought .
 In fact ...
 I bought this for you last night .
 I hope it 's okay .
 Sorry for being so blunt .
 I probably should have had a fancy speech prepared . But ...
 But if you 'll have me ...
 I guess that 's a yes , huh ?
 Oh .
 That 's more than a yes .
 That 's a " you betcha . "
 Hello .
 Yes , hello .
 My name is Mary Booth .
 I live in your neighborhood .
 I drove by your home and saw the ambulance .
 I was concerned .
 Did something happen to Mr. Castillo ?
 Yes .
 My father died last night .
 Oh , no .
 Well , um ...
 This is just awful of me to ask , but do you know how he died ?
 What do you mean ?
 Well , I was in a café last week , and I overheard his wife Rita saying the most awful things about him and the money that she expected to inherit .
 Uh , " Any day now " was the phrase that she used .
 When you said that he 'd died , the hairs on the back of my neck just stood up .
 I ...
 Maybe it 's wrong of me , but I felt that I had to say something .
 No .
 It 's a good thing you called .
