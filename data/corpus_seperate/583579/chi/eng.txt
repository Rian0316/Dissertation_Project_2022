 This is just -- The One With the Blackout English Subtitles by GELULA & CO . , INC .






 This is so cool , you guys .
 The entire city 's blacked out .
 Mom says it 's Manhattan , Brooklyn and Queens . . . . . . and doesn 't know when it 'II be back on .
 You guys , this is big . Pants and a sweater .
 Why , Mom ? Who wiII I meet in a blackout ?
 Power- company guys ? Eligible Iooters ?
 Can we talk about this Iater ?

 Can I borrow the phone ?
 I wanna caII my apartment and check on my grandma .
 What 's my number ?
 I never caII me .
 Oh , my God ! It 's her .
 It 's that Victoria Secret model . Something Goodacre .
 Hi , Mom , it 's JiIl . She 's right . It 's Jill .
 Jill Goodacre .
 Oh , my God ! I am trapped in an A TM vestibule with Jill Goodacre .
 Is it a vestibule ?
 Maybe it 's an atrium ? Yeah , that is the part to focus on , you idiot .
 I 'm fine . I 'm just stuck at the bank in an ATM vestibule .
 Jill says vestibule ... ... I 'm going with vestibule .
 I 'm fine . No , I 'm not alone .
 I don 't know , some guy .
 Oh , some guy . I am some guy .
 Hey Jill , I saw you with some guy last night .
 Yes , he was some guy .
 Hey , everyone .
 Officiating at tonight 's blackout is Rabbi Tribbiani .
 Chandler 's old roommate was Jewish , and these are the only candles we have . . . . . . so happy Hanukkah !
 Look ! Ugly Naked Guy Iit a bunch of candles .
 That had to hurt !
 All right , all right !
 It 's been 1 4 Â½ minutes ... ... and you still haven 't said one word .
 Oh , God ! Do something !
 Just make contact . Smile !
 There you go .
 You 're definitely scaring her .
 Would you Iike to caII somebody ?
 Yeah , about 300 guys I went to high school with .
 Yeah , thanks .
 It 's me .
 It 's Chandler .
 Are you okay ? I 'm fine .
 I 'm stuck in an ATM vestibule . . . . . . with JiII Goodacre .
 What ?
 I 'm stuck . . . . . . in an ATM vestibule . . . . . . with JiII Goodacre .
 I have no idea what you said .
 Put Joey on the phone .
 What 's up , man ?
 I 'm stuck . . . . . . in an ATM vestibule . . . . . . with JiII Goodacre !
 Oh , my God !
 He 's trapped in an ATM vestibule with JiII Goodacre !
 Chandler , Iisten .
 Like that thought never entered my mind .
 Come on , somebody .
 I 'II go . I 'II go .
 Senior year of coIlege , on a pooI table .
 PooI table ? That 's my sister .
 My weirdest place would have to be . . . . . . the women 's room on the second floor of the New York City Public Library .
 Oh , my God ! What were you doing in a Iibrary ?
 Pheebs , what about you ?
 Milwaukee .
 Ross ?
 Disneyland , 1 989 . " It 's a smaII world after aIl . "
 No way !
 The ride broke down . . . . . . so CaroI and I went behind a couple of those mechanicaI Dutch children .
 They fixed the ride , and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom .
 Rachel ? I already went .
 - You did not go .
 - Yes , I did . TeII us . Come on .
 The weirdest place would have to be . . .
 . . . the foot of the bed .
 - Step back ! - We have a winner !
 I 've never had a relationship with that kind of passion .
 Where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park .
 It was the only thing to do there that didn 't have a Iine .
 Barry wouldn 't even kiss me on a miniature golf course .
 Come on .
 He said we were holding up the people behind us .
 And you didn 't marry him because . . . ?
 Do you think there are people that go through Iife . . . . . . never having that kind of . . . ?
 - Probably . - ReaIly ?
 I 'II teII you something .
 Passion is way overrated . - Yeah , right . - It is .
 EventuaIly , it kind of burns out .
 But hopefuIly what you 're Ieft with is trust and security and . . . .
 In my ex- wife 's case , Iesbianism .
 For aII those people who miss out on that passion thing . . . . . . there 's other good stuff .
 But I don 't think that 'II be you . You don 't ?

 I see big passion in your future .
 ReaIly ?
 - You do ? - I do .
 Ross , you 're so great .
 It 's never gonna happen .
 What ?
 You and Rachel .
 Why not ?
 Because you waited too Iong to make your move . . . . . . and now you 're in the " Friend Zone . "
 I 'm not in the Zone .
 No , Ross . You 're mayor of the Zone .
 Look , I 'm taking my time , aII right ?
 I 'm Iaying the groundwork .
 Every day I get a Iittle bit closer to . . . .
 Priesthood ! I 'm teIling you , she has no idea what you 're thinking .
 If you don 't ask her out soon , you 'II end up stuck in the Zone forever .
 I wiIl , I wiIl . I 'm waiting for the right moment .
 What ?
 What , now ?
 What 's messing you up ?
 The wine ? The candles ?
 The moonlight ?
 You gotta go up to her and say , " Look , Rachel , I think -- "
 - What are we shushing ?
 - We 're shushing . . . . . . because we 're trying to hear something .
 What ?
 Don 't you hear that ?
 See ?
 Would you Iike some gum ?
 Is it sugarless ?
 - Sorry , it 's not .
 - Then , no thanks .
 What the hell was that ?
 Mental note : If Jill Goodacre offers you gum , you take it .
 If she offers you mangled animal carcass , you take it !
 New York City has no power
 And the milk is getting sour
 But to me it is not scary
 ' Cause I stay away from dairy
 - Here goes . - You 'II do it ?
 - I 'II do it .
 - Want help ?
 You come out there , you 're a dead man .
 Good Iuck , man .
 Thanks .
 - Where you going ?
 - Outside . You can 't !
 Why not ?
 Because of the reason .
 That would be . . . ?
 I can 't teII you .
 What 's going on ?
 Listen . You gotta promise you 'II never , ever teII Ross that I told you .
 - About what ?
 - He 's planning your birthday party .
 Oh , my God ! I love him !
 You better act surprised .
 About what ? My surprise party .
 - What surprise party ? - Oh , stop it .
 Joey already told me .
 WeIl , he didn 't teII me .
 Don 't Iook at me . This is Ross ' thing .
 This is so typical .
 I 'm always the Iast to know everything .
 You are not .
 We teII you stuff . I was the Iast one to know when Chandler got bit by the peacock at the zoo .
 I was the Iast to know you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in .

 Looks Iike I was second to Iast .
 It 's so nice .
 I have a question .
 ActuaIly , it 's not so much a question . . . . . . it 's more of a generaI wondering . . . . -- ment .

 Here goes .
 WeIl , for a while now , I 've been wanting to . . . .
 Yes , that 's right .
 Look at that Iittle kitty !
 I 'm on the top of the world Looking down on creation
 And the only explanation I can find
 Is the love that I found Ever since you 've been around
 AII right , this is just Bactine . It won 't hurt .
 Sorry , that was wax .
 Poor Iittle Tootie 's scared .
 We should find his owner .
 Why not put " poor Iittle Tootie " in the haIl ?
 During a blackout ? She 'II get trampled .

 On second thought , gum would be perfection .
 Gum would be perfection ?
 Gum would be perfection .
 Could 've said , " Gum would be nice . " " I 'll have a stick . " But , no .
 For me , gum is perfection .
 I loathe myself !
 Oh , no , the MeIlons .
 They hate aII Iiving things , right ?
 We just found this cat . . . . . . and we 're Iooking for the owner .
 It 's mine .
 He seems to hate you .
 Are you sure ?
 It 's my cat . Give me my cat .
 Wait a minute . What 's his name ?
 Bob -- Buttons .
 Bob Buttons ? Bob Buttons .
 Here , Bob Buttons .
 You are a very bad man !
 You owe me a cat .
 Here , kitty , kitty , kitty .
 Where did you go , Iittle kitty , kitty ?

 Come on , Iucky sixes !
 Everybody , this is Paolo .
 Paolo , I want you to meet my friends .
 This is Monica . . .
 . . . and Joey . . .
 . . . and Ross .

 He doesn 't speak much English .
 Monopoly !
 Look at that !
 Where did Paolo come from ?
 Italy , I think . No , I mean tonight , in the building ?
 Suddenly into our Iives ?
 The cat turned out to be Paolo 's cat .
 Isn 't that funny ?
 That is funny .
 And RacheI keeps touching him .
 I Iooked aII over the building and I couldn 't find the kitty anywhere .
 I found him . It was Paolo 's cat .
 WeIl , there you go . Last to know again .
 And I 'm guessing , since nobody told me , this is Paolo ?
 Paolo , this is Phoebe .

 You betcha !
 All right . Okay . What next ?
 Blow a bubble . A bubble 's good . It 's got a boyish charm .
 It 's impish .
 Here we go .
 Nice going , imp ! It 's okay .
 All I need to do is ... ... reach over and put it back in my mouth .
 Good save !
 We 're back on track and I 'm ... ... chewing someone else 's gum .
 This is not my gum !
 Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! And now you 're choking .
 You aII right ?
 Oh , my God !
 You 're choking !
 Better ?
 Thank you .
 That was . . . .
 That was . . . . Perfection ?
 What 'd he say that was so funny ?
 I have absolutely no idea .
 That 's classic . My God , you guys !
 What am I doing ?
 This is so un- me !
 If you want , I 'II do it .
 I just wanna bite his bottom Iip .
 But I won 't .
 The first time he smiled at me . . . . . . those seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry .
 Did you rent mopeds ?
 Because I 've heard -- Oh , it 's not about that right now .
 I know it 's totaIly superficial , and we have nothing in common . . . . . . . and we don 't even speak the same Ianguage . . . . . . but God !

 Listen . . . .
 Listen , something you should know .
 RacheI and I are . . . . We 're kind of a thing .
 - Thing ? - Thing . Yes , thing .
 You have the sex ?
 TechnicaIly , the sex is not being had .
 But that 's . . . . That 's not the point .
 The point is that RacheI and I should be . . . . WeIl , RacheI and I should be together .
 And if you get in the . . . .
 In bed ?
 No , not where I was going .
 If you get in the way of us becoming a thing . . . . . . then I would be , weIl , very sad .
 So do you . . . ?

 You do know a Iittle English ? Little .
 Do you know the word crap- weasel ?

 That 's funny , you are a huge crap- weasel .

 Chandler , we 've been here for an hour doing this . Watch , it 's easy .
 Ready ?
 Now try it .
 You gotta whip it .
 Look , Iook ! The Iast candle 's about to burn out .
 1 0 , 9 , 8 , 7 . . . . . . minus 46 , minus 47 , minus 48 . . . .
 - Thank you . - Thanks .
 Kind of spooky without any Iights .
 Okay , guys , I have the definitive one .
 This isn 't the best time to bring it up . . . . . . but you have to throw a party for Monica .
 This has been fun .
 Thanks for Ietting me use your phone . . . . . . and for saving my Iife .
 Yes .
 WeIl , goodbye , Chandler .
 I had a great blackout .
 See you .
 I 'm account number 7 1 43457 .
 And I don 't know if you got any of that . . . . . . but I would reaIly Iike a copy of the tape .
