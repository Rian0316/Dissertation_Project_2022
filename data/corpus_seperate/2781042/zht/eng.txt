 00 : 00 : 07, 600 -- > 00 : 00 : 09, 200 They just walked out of there !




 Yeah , I know , I was sort of sitting next to you .
 The whole Waters family . They just walked right out of there ! Again , I was in the room .
 How do they always manage that ? ! They 're good .
 They 're greedy and they 'll do it again , and next time we 're going to catch them in the act .
 How ?



 No good ?
 They always know we 're coming . How do they always know ? !
 They 're good , they work at it .
 They 're never going to stop .
 Well , neither are we .



 Argh !



 Argh !
 Argh !
 AARGH !
 Oh !
 Greg ...
 In the act !
 It 's the only way we 're going to do this , in the act !
 COMPUTER BEEPS


 They 're still blocking it ? Yeah .
 Very efficiently hacked . They must be bloody pleased with themselves .
 They must be .
 Right then ?
 Ah , no !
 No , you 've got to make the arrest . This one 's yours , boss . You 've never called me boss before .
 Oh , well , look what happens when you 're good .
 You know how most days aren 't good days ? This is a good day .
 Not for the Waters family . TEXT ALERT
 OK , ten men on the roof , all exits covered .
 The bank 's closed , so we 've no hostages to worry about . TEXT ALERT Sorry , no , go on .
 Go on .
 Um , we 've got the tunnel entrance covered ...
 TEXT ALERT ... and Davies , Willow and Christie are heading up armed response on Mafeking Road .
 TEXT ALERT
 Sorry , I 'd better get this .
 It 's him , isn 't it ?






 I , I , I have to go .



 What ? ! You make the arrest . No way !
 Sorry , you 'll be fine .
 I 'm cool with this .
 Jones will get all the credit if you leave now , you know he will .
 Yeah , well , yeah , it doesn 't matter , I have to go .
 Back up !
 I need maximum back up ! Baker Street now !

 What 's going on ? !
 This is hard .
 What ? Really hard .
 Hardest thing I 've ever had to do .
 Do you know any funny stories about John ?

 What ? !
 I need anecdotes .
 Didn 't go to any trouble , did you ? SlRENS WAlL , HELlCOPTER HOVERS

 VlOLlN MUSlC

 Shut up , Mrs Hudson . I haven 't said a word .
 You 're formulating a question , it 's physically painful watching you think .
 I thought it was you playing . It was me playing . MUSlC STOPS
 I am composing .
 You were dancing .
 I was road- testing . You what ? Why are you here ?
 I 'm bringing you your morning tea .
 You 're not usually awake . You bring me tea in the morning ?
 Well , where do you think it came from ?
 I don 't know .
 I just thought it sort of happened . Your mother has a lot to answer for .
 Hmm , I know .
 I have a list . Mycroft has a file .
 So , it 's the big day then .
 What big day ?
 The wedding !
 John and Mary getting married .
 Two people who currently live together are about to attend church , have a party , go on a short holiday , then carry on living together .
 What 's big about that ?
 It changes people , marriage . Hmm , no it doesn 't .
 Well , you wouldn 't understand , cos you always live alone .
 Your husband was executed for double murder .
 You 're hardly an advert for companionship .
 Marriage changes you as a person in ways that you can 't imagine . As does lethal injection .
 My best friend , Margaret , she was my chief bridesmaid , we were going to be best friends forever , we always said that , but I hardly saw her after that .
 Aren 't there usually biscuits ?
 I 've run out . Have the shops ?
 She cried the whole day , saying , " Ooh , it 's the end of an era . "
 I 'm sure the shop on the corner is open . She was probably right , really .
 I remember she left early .
 I mean , who leaves a wedding early ? So sad . Hmm .
 Anyway , you 've got things to do . No , not really .
 I 've got plenty of time to get ready ... Biscuits ! Oh !
 I really am going to have a word with your mother .
 You can if you like , she understands very little .
 Right then .
 Into battle .
 CHURCH BELLS TOLL
 Congratulations !
 OK , hold it there , I want to get this shot of the newlyweds .
 Er , just the bride and groom , please . Sherlock ...
 Oh , sorry .
 OK , three , two , one , cheese .
 The famous Mr Holmes . I 'm very pleased to meet you . But no sex , OK ?
 Sorry ? ! You don 't have to look so scared , I 'm only messing .
 Bridesmaid , best man , it 's a bit traditional .
 Is it ?
 But not obligatory .
 If that 's the sort of thing you 're looking for , the man over there in blue is your best bet .
 Recently divorced doctor with a ginger cat ...
 A barn conversion and a history of erectile dysfunction .
 Reviewing that information , possibly not your best bet . Yeah , maybe not .
 Sorry , there was one more deduction there than I was expecting .
 Mr Holmes , you 're going to be incredibly useful .
 Hello .
 Lovely to meet you . How are you ?
 Beautiful , Mary . Thank you .
 Congratulations . David !
 Ah , ah , Mary . Congratulations , you look , um , very nice .
 Thanks . John , congratulations .
 You 're a lucky man . Thank you . Um , David , this is Sherlock .
 Hmm .
 Um , yeah , we 've um ... We 've met .
 So , what exactly are my duties as an usher ?
 Let 's talk about Mary first . Sorry , what ?
 Well , I think you know what .
 You went out with her for two years .
 Er , ages ago .
 We 're ...
 We 're just good friends now . Is that a fact ?
 Whenever she tweets , you respond within five minutes , regardless of time or current location , suggesting you have her on text alert .
 In your Facebook photographs of the happy couple ,
 Mary takes centre frame , whereas John is always partly or entirely excluded .
 Well , you can 't assume from that I 've still got some kind of interest in Mary ...
 You volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on on no less than three separate occasions .
 Do you have anything to say in your defence ?
 I think from now on , we 'll downgrade you to casual acquaintance .
 No more than three planned social encounters a year and always in John 's presence .
 I have your contact details .
 I will be monitoring .
 They 're right about you . You 're a bloody psychopath .
 High functioning sociopath , with your number .
 Um ...
 Hello .
 Darling .
 Thank you . You look fabulous . Thank you .
 Thanks for coming , thank you .

 Er , yes , well done in the service , Archie . He 's really come out of his shell .
 I don 't know how you did it .
 Um ...
 Basically it 's a cute smile to the bride 's side , cute smile to the groom 's side and then the rings .
 No . And you have to wear the outfit .
 No . You really do have to wear the outfit .
 What for ?
 Grown- ups like that sort of thing . Why ?
 I don 't know , I 'll ask one .
 You 're a detective . Yep . Have you solved any murders ?
 Sure , loads .
 Can I see ? Yeah , all right .

 COMPUTER BEEPS
 What 's all the stuff in his eye ? Maggots .
 Cool ! Hmm .
 He said you had some pictures for him , as a treat ? Er , yes , if he 's good .
 Beheadings .
 Lovely little village . Hmm ?
 What did you say ?
 Hold it .

 Nice .

 I 'm starving .
 Thanks . I had to lose so much weight to get into this dress .
 JOHN LAUGHS
 Hmm , he 's nice .
 Traces of two leading brands of deodorant , both advertised for their strength , suggestive of a chronic body odour problem , manifesting under stress .
 OK , done there .
 What about his friend ?
 Long- term relationship , compulsive cheat . Seriously ?
 Waterproof cover on his smart- phone .
 Yet his complexion doesn 't indicate outdoor work .
 It suggests he 's in the habit of taking his phone into the shower with him , which means he often receives texts and emails he 'd rather went unseen .
 Can I keep you ?
 Do you like solving crimes ?
 Do you have a vacancy ?
 So , Harry ?
 Er , no . No show . Darling , I 'm so sorry .
 Yeah , it was a bit of a punt asking her , I suppose .
 Still , free bar , wouldn 't have been a good mix . Oh .
 God , wow ! Is that ... ?
 He came .
 So that 's him , Major Sholto . Uh- huh .
 If they 're such good friends , why does he barely even mention him ?
 He mentions him all the time to me , never shuts up about him .
 About HlM ?
 Mm- hmm . Urgh !
 I chose this wine , it 's bloody awful ! Yes , but it 's definitely him that he talks about ?
 Mm- hmm .
 I 'm very , very , glad to see you , sir .
 I know you don 't really do this sort of thing .
 Well , I do for old friends , Watson .
 John .
 It 's good to see you . You too .
 Civilian life suiting you , then ? Er , er , yes . Well , I think so , sir .
 No more need for the trick cyclist ?
 No , I go now and then .
 Sort of a top- up .
 Therapy can be very helpful .
 Where are you living these days ?
 Oh , way out in the middle of nowhere . You wouldn 't know it . You look well ...
 I 've never even heard him say his name .
 Well , he 's almost a recluse , you know , since ... Yes . I didn 't think he 'd show up at all .
 John says he 's the most unsociable man he 's ever met .
 He is ? He 's the most unsociable ?
 Hmm .
 Ah , that 's why he 's bouncing around him like a puppy .
 Oh , Sherlock !
 Neither of us were the first , you know . Stop smiling .
 It 's my wedding day !
 Urgh !
 BANGlNG
 PHONE RlNGS
 Yes ?
 What , Sherlock ? Why are you out of breath ?
 Filing .
 Either I 've caught you in a compromising position or you 've been working out again .
 I favour the latter .
 What do you want ?
 I need your answer , Mycroft , as a matter of urgency . Answer ?
 Even at the eleventh hour , it 's not too late , you know .
 Oh , Lord !
 Cars can be ordered , private jets commandeered .
 Today .
 It 's today , isn 't it ?
 No , Sherlock , I will not be coming to the night- do , as you so poetically put it .
 What a shame .
 Mary and John will be extremely d ...
 Delighted not to have me hanging around . Oh , I don 't know .
 There should always be a spectre at the feast .
 So , this is it , then ? The big day .
 I suppose I 'll be seeing a lot more of you from now on . What do you mean ?
 Just like old times . No , I don 't understand .
 'Well , it 's the end of an era , isn 't it ? '
 John and Mary , domestic bliss .
 No , no , no .
 I prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new chapter .
 What ?
 Nothing .
 I know that silence .
 What ? Well , I 'd better let you get back to it .
 You have a big speech or something , don 't you ?
 What ?
 Cakes , karaoke , mingling . Mycroft ! This is what people do , Sherlock .
 They get married .
 I warned you , don 't get involved .
 Involved ?
 I 'm not involved . No ... John asked me to be his best man , how could I say no ?
 Absolutely . I 'm not involved .
 I believe you .
 Really , I do .
 Have a lovely day and do give the happy couple my best . I will .
 Oh , by the way , Sherlock , do you remember Redbeard ?
 I 'm not a child anymore , Mycroft . No , of course you 're not .
 Enjoy not getting involved , Sherlock .

 Pray silence for the best man . CHEERlNG AND APPLAUSE
 Ladies and gentlemen , family and friends , and ... um , others .

 Er ...
 A- also ...

 Greg ...
 Molly .
 I 've just had a thought .
 Is that a brain ?
 What if John asks Sherlock to be his best man ?
 Well , he will , won 't he ? He 's bound to . Exactly .
 So ?
 So , he 'll have to make a speech , in front of people .
 There 'll be actual people there , actually listening .
 Well , what 's the worst that could happen ?
 Helen- Louise probably wondered the same . Helen- Louise ?

 PHONE RlNGS
 Oh , hello dear .
 I was just thinking , if John does ask Sherlock ... What , the speech , dear ?
 No , it 'll be fine . It 's not just the speech , though , is it ?
 MRS HUDSON LAUGHS
 Oh , brilliant ! Mrs Hudson ? Hello , darling .
 Are you all right ?
 I was coming to see Sherlock and I thought you were ...
 No ...
 Possibly dying .
 Oh , sorry .
 What 's wrong ?
 The telegrams !
 Sorry , what ?
 Oh , sorry .
 Telegrams !
 Right , um ...
 First things first , telegrams . Well , they 're not actually telegrams , we just call them telegrams .
 I don 't know why .
 Wedding tradition .
 Because we don 't have enough of that already , apparently .
 " To Mr and Mrs Watson ,
 " so sorry I am unable to be with you on your special day .
 " Good luck and best wishes , Mike Stanford . " Aah . Aw .
 " To John and Mary , all good wishes for your special day , " " with love and many big ... "
 " Big squishy cuddles from Stella and Ted . "
 " Mary , lots of love ... "
 Yeah ?
 " Poppet .
 Oodles of love and heaps of good wishes from Cam . "
 " Wish your family could have seen this . "
 " Special day ... " " Very special day ... "
 " Love ... " " Love ... " " Love ... " " Love ... " " Love ... " Bit of a theme , you get the general gist .
 People are basically fond .
 QUlET LAUGHTER
 John Watson .
 My friend , John Watson .
 John ...
 When John first broached the subject of being best man , I was confused . Sherlock ?
 What was that noise downstairs ? Oh , it was Mrs Hudson laughing .
 Hmm , it sounded like she was torturing an owl .
 Yeah , well , it was laughter .
 Could have been both .
 Busy ?
 Oh , just occupying myself . Sometimes it 's so hard not smoking . Mind if I interrupt ?
 Be my guest .

 Tea ?
 Er ...
 So , er , the big question . Mm- hmm ?
 The best man .
 The best man ?
 What do you think ?
 Billy Kincaid . Sorry , what ?
 Billy Kincaid , the Camden Garrotter , best man I ever knew .
 Vast contributions to charity , never disclosed .
 Personally managed to save three hospitals from closure and ran the best and safest children 's homes in north England .
 Yes , every now and again there 'd be some garrotings , but stacking up the lives saved against the garrotings , on balance I 'd say he ...
 For my wedding . For me , I need a best man .
 Oh , right .
 Maybe not a garrotter . Gavin ?
 Who ? Gavin Lestrade ?
 He 's a man and good at it . It 's Greg .
 And he 's not my best friend . Oh , Mike Stanford , I see .
 Well , he 's nice .
 Um , though I 'm not sure how well he 'd cope with all ...
 No , Mike 's great , but HE 'S not my best friend .
 Look , Sherlock , this is the biggest and most important day of my life ... Well ...
 No , it is . It is .
 And I want to be up there with the two people that I love and care about most in the world .
 Yes .
 So Mary Morstan ... Yes .
 And ...

 ... you .

 I confess at first I didn 't realise he was asking me .
 When finally I understood , I expressed to him that I was both flattered and surprised .

 I explained to him that I 'd never expected this request and I was a little daunted in the face of it .
 Sherlock ...

 I nonetheless promised I would do my very best to accomplish a task which was , for me , as demanding and difficult as any I had ever contemplated .
 Additionally , I thanked him for the trust he placed in me and indicated that I was , in some ways , very close to being moved by it .
 No , it 's getting a bit scary now .
 It later transpired that I 'd said none of this out loud . LAUGHTER
 So , in fact ...

 You , you mean ... Yes .
 I 'm your ... best ...
 Man . .. friend ?
 Yeah , of course you are .
 Of course ...
 You 're my best friend .
 How was that ?
 Surprisingly OK .
 So you 'll have to make a speech , of course .
 Done that . Done that . Done that bit , done that bit .
 Done that bit .
 Hmm .
 I 'm afraid , John , I can 't congratulate you .
 All emotions , and in particular love , stand opposed to the pure , cold reason I hold above all things .
 A wedding is , in my considered opinion , nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world .
 Today we honour the deathwatch beetle that is the doom of our society , and in time , one feels certain , our entire species .

 But anyway , let 's talk about John . Please .
 If I burden myself with a little helpmate during my adventures , this is not out of sentiment or caprice , it is that he has many fine qualities of his own that he has overlooked in his obsession with me .
 Indeed , any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes , in truth , from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides .
 It is a fact , I believe , that brides tend to favour exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day .
 There is a certain analogy there , I feel .
 And contrast is , after all , God 's own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation .
 Or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot .
 MUTTERlNG
 The point I 'm trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant , rude , ignorant and all- round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet .
 I am dismissive of the virtuous , unaware of the beautiful and uncomprehending in the face of the happy .
 So if I didn 't understand I was being asked to be best man , it is because I never expected to be anybody 's best friend .
 And certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being
 I have ever had the good fortune of knowing . John , I am a ridiculous man .
 Redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship .
 But , as I am apparently your best friend ,
 I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion .
 Actually , now I can .

 Mary , when I say you deserve this man , it is the highest compliment of which I am capable .
 John , you have endured war and injury and tragic loss - so sorry again about that last one - so know this , today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved .

 In short , the two people who love you most in all this world .
 And I know I speak for Mary as well when I say , we will never let you down and we have a lifetime ahead to prove that .
 ( If I try and hug him , stop me . ) Certainly not .

 Ah , yes .
 Now onto some funny stories about John .
 What 's wrong ?
 What happened ?
 Why are you all doing that ? John ?
 Oh , Sherlock !
 Did I do it wrong ?
 No , you didn 't . Come here . APPLAUSE
 I haven 't finished yet .
 Yeah , I know , I know . So onto some funny stories now ...
 Can you wait till I sit down ?
 So , onto some funny stories about John .
 If you could all just cheer up a bit , that would be better . On we go .
 So for funny stories , one has to look no further than John 's blog .
 The record of our time together .
 Of course , he does tend to romanticise things a bit , but then , you know , he 's a romantic .
 We 've tackled some strange cases .
 The Hollow Client ...
 The Poison Giant ...

 Get down , John !

 We 've had some frustrating cases ...
 What is that ?
 A French decathlete found completely out of his mind , surrounded by 1, 812 matchboxes , all empty except this one .
 And what 's in that one ?

 Inexplicable .
 Touching cases ...
 She 's going to ring the doorbell . Oh , no .
 She 's changed her mind .
 Oh , she 's going to do it . No , she 's leaving . She 's leaving .
 Oh , she 's coming back . She 's a client , she 's boring .
 I 've seen those symptoms before .
 Hmm ?
 Oscillation on the pavement always means there 's a love affair .
 And of course I have to mention the elephant in the room ...
 ELEPHANT TRUMPETS
 But we want something very particular for this special day , don 't we ?

 The Bloody Guardsman ...

 Need to work on your half of the church , Mary , looking a bit thin .



 Oh , orphan 's lot .
 Friends , that 's all I have , lots of friends . Schedule the organ music to begin at precisely 11 : 48 ...
 But the rehearsal 's not for another two weeks , just calm down .
 Calm ? I am calm . I 'm extremely calm .
 Let 's get back to the reception , come on .
 John 's cousin , top table ?
 Hmm , hates you .
 Can 't even bear to think about you . Seriously ?
 Second class post , cheap card . Bought at a petrol station .
 Look at the stamp , three attempts at licking , she 's obviously unconsciously retaining saliva .
 Ah , let 's stick her by the bogs .
 Oh , yes .
 Who else hates me ?

 Oh , great , thanks .
 " Priceless painting nicked . "
 Looks interesting . Table four ... Done .
 " My husband is three people . "
 Table five ...
 Major James Sholto - who he ? John 's old commanding officer .
 I don 't think he 's coming .
 He 'll be there . Well , he needs to RSVP , then .
 He 'll be there . Oh . " My husband is three people . "
 It 's interesting .
 It says he has three distinct patterns of moles on his skin . Identical triplets , one in half a million births .
 Solved it without leaving the flat .
 Now , serviettes ... Swan or Sydney Opera House ? Where did you learn that ?
 Many skills are required in the field of criminal investigation ...
 Fibbing , Sherlock .
 I once broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact severity of a fold ...
 I 'm not John , I can tell when you 're fibbing .
 OK , I learnt it on YouTube . Opera House , please .
 Oh , hang on , I 'm buzzing . Hello ?
 Oh , hi , Beth .
 Yeah , yeah , I don 't see why not . Actually , if that 's Beth , it 's probably for me too , hang on .

 He knows we don 't have a friend called Beth , he 's going to figure out that it 's code .
 He 's YouTubing serviettes .
 He 's thorough . He 's terrified .
 Of course he 's not .
 When you 're scared of something you start wishing it sooner , just to get it all going .
 But why would he be scared that we 're getting married ?
 It 's not going to change anything , we 'll still do stuff .
 You need to prove it to him .
 I told you to find him a new case .
 I 'm trying .
 But you need to run him , OK ? Show him it 's still the good old days .

 That just sort of happened .
 Sherlock , um , mate ...
 I have ...
 I 've smelled 18 different perfumes ,
 I 've sampled nine different slices of cake , which all tasted identical .
 I like the bridesmaids in purple ...
 Lilac .
 Lilac .
 Um , there are no more decisions left to make .
 I don 't even understand the decisions that we have made . I 'm faking opinions , and it 's exhausting .
 So , please , before she comes back ... pick something .
 Anything .
 Pick one . Pick what ? A case .
 Your inbox is bursting . Just ... get me out of here .
 You want to go out on a case ?
 Now ? Please .
 Sherlock , for me .
 Don 't you worry about a thing , I 'll get you out of this .
 Oh .
 " Dear Mr Holmes , my name is Bainbridge . " " I 'm a Private in Her Majesty 's Household Guard . "
 " I 'm writing to you about a personal matter ... "
 " One I don 't care to bring before my superiors , "
 " it would sound so trivial . "
 " But I think someone 's stalking me . " " I 'm used to tourists , it 's part of the job , "
 " but this is different . "
 " Someone 's watching me . "

 " He 's taking pictures of me every day . "
 " I don 't want to mention it to the Major , but it 's really preying on my mind . "
 Uniform fetishist ?
 All the nice girls like a soldier . It 's " sailor " .
 And Bainbridge thinks his stalker is a bloke . Let 's go and investigate .
 Please . Elite guard .
 40 enlisted men and officers . Why this particular Grenadier ?
 Curious . Now you 're talking .

 OK .
 Bye !
 Er , we 're just going to ...
 I need , um , Sherlock to help me choose some er ... Ties .
 Socks .
 Why don 't we go with socks ? Yeah .
 I mean , you 've got to get the right ones .
 Exactly , to go with my ...
 Tie .
 Outfit .
 That 'll take a while , right ? Is my coat in there ?
 Yes .
 I 'm just going to take him out for a bit . Run him . I know .
 You said you 'd find him a case . Hmm . Coming , Sherlock ?
 Coming !
 Taxi !
 Company halt !
 Right turn !
 We 're here to see Private Stephen Bainbridge . He 's on duty right now , sir .
 But I 'll certainly let him know when he 's free .
 And when will that be ?
 Another hour .

 Do you think they give them classes ? Classes ?
 How to resist the temptation to scratch their behinds .
 Afferent neurons in the peripheral nervous system .
 Bum- itch .
 Oh .
 So why don 't you see him any more ? Who ?
 Your previous commander , Sholto . Previous commander ?
 I meant ex .
 " Previous " suggests that I currently have a commander .
 Which you don 't .
 Which I don 't .
 Of course you don 't .
 He was decorated , wasn 't he ? A war hero ? Not to everyone .
 He led a team of crows into battle .
 Crows ? New recruits .
 It 's standard procedure - break the new boys in .
 But it went wrong .
 They all died , he was the only survivor .
 The press and families gave him hell , he gets more death threats than you .
 Oh , I wouldn 't count on that .
 And why have you suddenly taken an interest in another human being ?
 I 'm " chatting " .

 I won 't be trying THAT again .
 Changing the subject completely ... you know it won 't alter anything , right , me and Mary getting married ?
 We 'll still be doing all this .
 Oh , good .
 If you were worried . I wasn 't worried .

 Hmm .
 The thing about Mary , she has completely turned my life around .

 Changed everything .

 But , for the record , over the last few years there are two people who have done that , and the other one is ... a complete dickhead .

 Can I ask what this is in connection with ?
 Private Bainbridge contacted us about a personal matter , sir .
 Nothing 's personal when it concerns my troops .
 What do you really want ?
 I 'm here on a legitimate enquiry .
 Are you press ?
 Digging for some bloody Royal story or something ? No , sir , I 'm Captain John Watson ,
 Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers .
 Retired .
 You could be a used- car salesman now , for all I know .
 Bainbridge ?
 Gentleman here to see you .

 Bainbridge !

 I know you , don 't I ?
 Hmm ?
 I 've seen you in the papers .
 You hang around with that detective , the one with the silly hat .
 What the hell does Bainbridge want with a detective ?
 I 'm afraid I 'm not at liberty to say . You 're not at liberty to say ?
 He 's a soldier in my regiment .
 I 'll be damned if he 's going to get up to cloak- and- dagger nonsense like this .
 Sir !
 Sir !
 What 's going on ?
 It 's Bainbridge , sir .
 He 's dead .

 My God ! Ah !
 No , let me take a look , sir , I 'm a doctor . What ?
 Sergeant , arrest this man !
 What ?
 No , no ! I 'm a doctor !
 Oh , you 're a doctor now too ?
 Sergeant . Let me examine him , please !
 Sir , caught this one snooping around .
 Is that what this is all about ?
 Distracting me , so that this man could get in here and kill Bainbridge ?
 Don 't be ... Kill him with what ?
 Where 's the weapon ?
 What ? Where 's the weapon ?
 Go on , search me - no weapon .
 Bainbridge was on parade , he came off duty five minutes ago .
 When 's this supposed to have happened ?
 You obviously stabbed him before he got into the shower .
 No .
 No ? ! He 's soaking wet and there 's shampoo in his hair .
 He got into the shower , then someone stabbed him .
 The cubicle was locked from the inside , sir .
 I had to break it open .
 You must have climbed over the top .
 But then I 'd be soaking wet too , wouldn 't I ?
 Major , please !
 I 'm John Watson , Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers , three years in Afghanistan , a veteran of Kandahar , Helmand and Bart 's bloody Hospital !
 Let me examine this body !

 Thank you .
 Suicide ?
 No .
 The weapon again , no knife .

 Now , there is a wound to the abdomen . Incredibly fine .
 Man stabbed to death , no murder weapon .
 Door locked from the inside .
 Only one way in or out of here .
 Sherlock ... Hmm ? He 's still breathing .
 Oh , my God !
 What do we do ?
 Give me your scarf . What ?
 Quickly , now !
 Call an ambulance ! What ? Call an ambulance , now !
 Do it !
 Nurse , press here , hard .
 Nurse ? Yeah , I 'm making do .
 Keep pressure on that wound .
 Stephen ? Stephen , stay with me .

 Private Bainbridge had just come off guard duty .
 He 'd stood there for hours , plenty of people watching , nothing apparently wrong .
 He came off duty and within minutes was nearly dead from a wound in his stomach , but there was no weapon .
 Where did it go ?
 Ladies and gentlemen , I invite you to consider this - a murderer who can walk through walls , a weapon that can vanish .
 But in all of this , there is only one element which can be said to be truly remarkable .

 Would anyone like to make a guess ?
 Come on , come on , there is actually an element of Q& A to all of this .
 Scotland Yard , have you got a theory ?
 Yeah , you , you 're a detective , broadly speaking .
 Got a theory ? Er , um , if the , er ...
 If the ... If the ...
 If the blade was propelled through the , erm ... ... grating in the air vent , maybe a ballista or a catapult , um ...
 Somebody tiny could crawl in there .
 So , yeah , we 're looking for a dwarf . Brilliant .
 Really ?
 No .
 Next ?
 ( He stabbed himself . ) Hello , who was that ?
 Tom ?

 Got a theory ?

 Attempted suicide , with a blade made of compacted blood and bone .
 Broke after piercing his abdomen ,
 like a meat ... dagger .
 A meat dagger ?
 Yes . ( Sit down . )

 No .
 There was one feature , and only one feature , of interest in the whole of this baffling case , and quite frankly it was the usual - John Watson .
 Who , while I was trying to solve a murder , instead saved a life .
 There are mysteries worth solving and stories worth telling .

 The best and bravest man I know and , on top of that , he actually knows how to do stuff .
 Except wedding planning and serviettes , he 's rubbish at those .
 Hmm .
 The case itself remains the most ingenious and brilliantly planned murder , or attempted murder ,
 I 've ever had the pleasure to encounter .
 The most perfect locked- room mystery of which I am aware .
 However , I 'm not just here to praise John ,
 I 'm also here to embarrass him , so let 's move on to ... No , wait ... How was it done ?
 How was what done ?
 The stabbing ?
 I 'm afraid I don 't know .
 I didn 't solve that one .
 It can happen sometimes , it 's very , very disappointing .
 Embarrassment leads me on to the stag night .
 Of course there 's hours of material here , but I 've cut it down to the really good bits .
 Murder scenes ?
 Locations of murders ?
 Hmm , pub crawl , themed . Yeah , but why can 't you just do Underground stations ?
 It lacks the personal touch .
 We 're going to go for a drink in every ...
 In every street where you 've found a corpse .
 Delightful ! Where do I come in ? Don 't want to get ill .
 That would ruin it , spoil the mood .
 You 're a graduate chemist , can 't you just work it out ?
 I lack the practical experience .
 Meaning you think I like a drink ?
 Occasionally .
 That I 'm a drunk . No ...
 No .
 You look ... well . I am .
 How 's ...

 Tom ?
 Not a sociopath . Still ?
 Good .
 And we 're having quite a lot of sex .

 OK .
 I want you to calculate John 's ideal intake , and mine , to remain in the sweet spot for the whole evening .
 Light- headed - good .

 Urinating in wardrobes - bad .
 Hmm .
 Two , erm ... beers , please . Pints ?
 443 . 7 millilitres .
 Ah .
 JOHN SlGHS
 HE CLEARS HlS THROAT What , are we on a schedule ?

 You 'll thank me .

 Cheers .
 Cheers .
 Over there .
 What ?
 Toilets - any second now you 're going to need ...
 Hang on , tell me after .
 I need the loo . Hmm , on schedule . Eh ?
 Nothing . Go !





 How long ?
 Sorry ?
 Your visit .
 Estimate approximate volume discharge ...



 Stop talking now .







 Oh , quick , one more . He mustn 't see .
 Here you go .
 Cheers .
 I know ash !
 Don 't tell me I don 't !

 All right , enough ! That 's ...
 Stand up . Ash .
 I know ash .
 I have an international reputation .
 Do you have an international reputation ?
 No , I don 't have an international reputation . No .
 And I can 't even remember what for .
 It 's crime ... something or other .
 Oh , what are you doing back ? I thought you were going to be up late .
 Ah , Hudders .
 What time is it ? You 've only been out two hours .







 Am I a vegetable ?
 You or the ... thing ... ?

 Pffrrrt ! Funny !
 Thank you .
 Come on .
 No , you 're not a vegetable .
 It 's your go .

 Erm ... am I human ? Sometimes .
 Can 't have sometimes .
 It has to be , um ...
 Yes , you 're human .
 Yes , I know , OK .
 And am I a man ? Yep . Tall ?

 Not as tall as people think . Hmm . Nice ?
 Ish .
 Clever ?
 I would say so .
 You would .
 Hmm , am I important ?
 To some people .
 Do people like me ?
 Erm , no they don 't .
 You tend to rub them up the wrong way .
 OK .
 Am I the current King of England ? JOHN LAUGHS
 You know we don 't have a King .
 Don 't we ?
 No . Your go .

 I don 't mind .
 Am I a woman ? SHERLOCK GUFFAWS
 What ?
 Yes .
 Am I ... pretty ?
 This ?

 Beauty is a construct based entirely on childhood impressions , influences and role models .


 Yeah , but am I a pretty lady ?

 I don 't know who you are , I don 't know who you 're supposed to be . You picked the name !
 But I picked it at random from the papers .
 You 're not really getting the hang of this game , are you , Sherlock ?
 So I am human , I 'm not as tall as people think I am .

 I 'm ...
 I 'm nice- ish , clever , important to some people .
 But I tend to rub them up the wrong way .
 Got it .
 Go on , then . I 'm you , aren 't I ?
 KNOCK AT DOOR Client !
 Hello .
 Hello .
 Come on . Which one of you is Sherlock Holmes ?

 I don 't ... a lot .
 I mean , I don 't date all that much .
 And he seemed nice , you know ?
 We seemed to automatically connect .
 We had one night , dinner , such interesting conversation .
 It was lovely . To be honest ,
 I 'd love to have gone further , but I thought , no , this is special ,
 let 's take it slowly .
 Exchanged numbers , he said he 'd get in touch and then ...

 Maybe he wasn 't quite as keen as I was , but I just thought at least he 'd call to say that we were finished .
 I went round there , to his flat , no trace of him .
 Mr Holmes , I honestly think
 I had dinner with a ghost .
 Mr Holmes ?

 With a ghost , Mr Holmes ! Boring , boring , boring .
 No ... fascinating .
 John .
 John !
 Wake up . I apologise about my ...
 You know ... Him . Rude .
 Rude !
 I checked with the landlord and the man who lived there died .
 Heart attack .
 And there we are having dinner one week on .
 And I found this thing online , a sort of chatroom thing , for girls who think they 're dating men from the spirit world .
 Don 't worry , I 'll find him in ten minutes . What 's your dog 's name ?
 Yeah , I 'm there if you want it ...
 John , wake up . Went to ...
 Yeah . The game is ... something .
 On ?
 Yeah , that , that .
 OK .

 Oh , it 's nice . Nice place .

 See anything ? Hmm ?
 Any clues , Mr Holmes ? Oh , errrm ...




















 I 'm just going to whip this out .
 You all right ?
 Hmm ? Yeah , he 's clueing . What ?
 He 's ...
 Hmm ?
 He 's clueing for looks .
 Mr Holmes ? HE SNORES
 Mr Holmes !
 I 'm calling the police . Oh , no ... Whoa , whoa , whoa !
 No , look , this is a famous detective , it 's Sherlock Holmes and his partner , John Hamish Watson .
 What do you think you 're doing ?
 Don 't compromise the integrity of the ...
 HE VOMlTS
 Crime scene .

 Yeah , that .

 CELL DOOR SLAMS OPEN Wakey- wakey !
 Oh , my God . Greg ...
 Is that Greg ?
 Get up .
 I 'm going to put you two in a taxi .
 I managed to square things with the desk sergeant .
 Ha !
 What a couple of lightweights - you couldn 't even make it to closing time !
 Can you whisper ? HE SHOUTS :
 Not really !

 Come on .

 Well , thanks for a ...
 You know ... an evening . It was awful .
 I was going to pretend , but ... it was , truly .
 Yeah .
 That woman , Tessa ...
 What ?
 Dated a ghost , most interesting case for months .
 What a wasted opportunity !
 OK .
 How are you feeling ?
 Hmm .
 It 's just like old times , having you back here .
 I thought I 'd make your favourite , one last time . Oh . Don 't sound so final about it ,
 I will be visiting , you know .
 Ooh , I 've heard that one before ! No , it 's different now , though , isn 't it ?
 It 's different to when we thought we 'd lost him .
 Well , marriage changes everything , John .
 Does it ? Yeah .
 You might not think it , but it does . It 's a different phase in your life .
 You meet knew people , cos you 're a couple , and then you just let your old friends slip away .
 It won 't be like that .
 Well , if you 've found the right one , the person that you click with , it 's the best thing in the world .
 Well , I have .
 I know I have . Oh , I 'm sure . She 's lovely .
 Yeah , I think so .
 What about you ? Me ?
 Did you think you 'd found the right one when you married Mr Hudson ?
 No .
 It was just a whirlwind thing for us . I knew it wouldn 't work , but I just got sort of swept along .

 Right . And then we moved to Florida .
 We had a fantastic time , but of course I didn 't know what he was up to .
 ( The drugs . ) Drugs ? !
 He was running , erm ... Oh , what do you call it ?
 Erm ...
 A ... cartel .
 And got in with a really bad crowd .
 Right .
 And then I found out about all the other women . I didn 't have a clue .
 So , when he was actually arrested for blowing someone 's head off , it was quite a relief , to be honest .
 Oh .
 It was purely physical between me and Frank . We couldn 't keep our hands off each other .
 I know , there was one night ...
 FAlNT FOOTSTEPS Oh , is that Sherlock ?
 Is it ?
 FAlNT FOOTSTEPS That 's Sherlock .

 Urgh ...







 There are going to be others .
 Others ?
 Victims , women .
 Most ghosts tend to haunt a single house . This ghost , however , is willing to commute .
 Look .
 Hmm ...
 Not you .
 Not you . Not you . Not you .
 Not you . Not you . Not you .
 Not you . Not you .
 Not you .
 Not you . Hmm ...
 Not you .
 Not you . Not you .
 Not you . Not you . Not you .
 Not you .
 Not you .
 Not you .
 Not you .
 Not you . Not you . Not you , you , you , or you , or you .
 Or not you , not you , not you , not you , not you , not you .
 Not you .

 Hi .
 Gail .

 Charlotte .
 Robyn .
 Vicky .

 How did you meet ?
 Came up to me in a pub .
 Same gym as me .
 We just got chatting on the bus .
 Online . Name ?
 Told you .
 His name .
 Oscar . Mike . Terry .
 Erm ...
 Love Monkey . Your place ? ALL :
 His place .
 Address ?
 THEY ALL GlVE DlFFERENT ADDRESSES
 Nothing happened .
 It was just ... very romantic .
 Four women in four nights .
 He must have something special . He was very charming .
 He listened . He was sweet .
 He had a lovely ...
 You OK ?
 You 've let your food go cold .
 Mrs Hudson will play hell . Not now , John .



 Sorry about that .


 He had a lovely manner .
 Different names , different addresses .
 Describe him .
 Short blonde hair .
 Dark hair . Long .
 Ginger . I like gingers .
 Couldn 't tell .
 He had a mask on .

 He 's stealing the identity of corpses , getting their names from the obituary columns .
 All single men .
 He 's using the dead man 's flat under the assumption it will be empty for a while .
 Free love nest .
 I feel sick . It 's gruesome .
 That 's awful .
 Clever ... Bastard !

 Hello , Tessa .
 Meanwhile , back to business .
 No- one wants to use a dead man 's home .
 At least not until it 's been cleared .
 So , he disguises himself .
 Steals the man 's home , steals his identity .
 But only for one night . Then he 's gone . He 's not a ghost , John .
 He 's a Mayfly . He lives for a day .
 So , what was it he was looking for ?
 Job ?
 Gardener . Cook .
 Private nurse . I do security work .
 Maid .
 Obvious .
 You all work for the same person .
 No , no , not the same employer . Damn ! Come on , we can do this .
 Ideal night out ?
 Clay- pigeon shooting .
 Line dancing . Pictures .
 Wine in front of the telly .
 Dungeon .

 Make- up ?
 Clarins . No7 .
 Maybelline .
 Nothing special . Whatever 's cheap .
 Perfume ?
 Chanel . Chanel .
 Chanel . Chanel .
 Estee Lauder .
 Ideal man ?
 George Clooney .
 Oh ... ! Home- loving .
 He 'd have to like cuddling .
 Caring .
 Ten things . One - someone who isn 't competitive with other men .
 Two - someone who isn 't constantly trying to define himself by his masculinity ...
 There 's a unifying factor , there has to be . None of you reported anything stolen .

 Security guard , gardener , cook , maid , private nurse . He 's romancing his way up a pecking order .
 Somebody 's pecking order .
 Come on , think . Unless ... Do you have a secret you 've never told anyone ?
 ALL : No .
 Gotcha !
 What do you mean ? Everyone has secrets and they all replied too quickly .
 Got to go . See you . No ...
 Wait ! Bye- bye . Wait !
 Sorry , sexy , some secrets have to stay secret .
 Enjoy the wedding .

 Why ?
 WHY would he date all of those women and not return their calls ?
 You 're missing the obvious , mate .
 Am I ? He 's a man .
 But why would he change his identity ?
 Maybe he 's married .

 Oh ...
 Married .
 Obvious , really .
 Our Mayfly Man was trying to escape the suffocating chains of domesticity and instead of endless nights in watching the telly or going to barbecues with the awful , dreadful , boring people he couldn 't stand , he used his wits , cleverness and powers of disguise to play the field .




 He was ...
 On second thoughts ,
 I probably should have told you about the elephant in the room .
 However , it does help to further illustrate how invaluable John is to me .
 I can read a crime scene the way he can understand a human being .
 I used to think that 's what made me special - quite frankly I still do .
 But a word to the wise , should any of you require the services of either of us ,
 I will solve your murder , but it takes John Watson to save your life .
 Trust me on that , I should know , he 's saved mine so many times and in so many ways .

 This blog is the story of two men and their , frankly , ridiculous adventures of murder , mystery and mayhem .
 But from now on , there 's a new story .
 A bigger adventure .
 Ladies and gentlemen , pray , charge your glasses and be upstanding .
 Today begin the adventures of Mary Elizabeth Watson and John Hamish Watson .
 The two reasons why every single one of us is ...
 What did you say ?
 You said ...
 " John Hamish Watson . " You said that .
 You said " Hamish . "
 This is a famous detective , it 's Sherlock Holmes and his partner , John Hamish Watson .
 How did you know ?
 How did YOU know his middle name ?
 He never tells anyone , he hates it .

 John " H " Watson ? Yep .

 Henry ?
 Shut up . Humphrey ?
 Shut up .
 SHOWER RUNS Higgins ?
 ' Go away ! '
 It took him years to confide in me .
 Oh ...
 That 's my birth certificate . Yep .

 And the woman - she knew .
 Hamish .
 HE CLEARS HlS THROAT
 John Hamish Watson , just if you were looking for baby names .
 God knows where she is .

 Out of my head , I am busy !
 There 's only one time that name 's been made public . Does it have to be on the invitation ?
 It 's your name .
 It 's traditional ...
 It 's funny ...
 ' Enjoy the wedding ... '
 Enjoy the wedding .
 The wedding .
 You knew about the wedding . More importantly , you 'd seen a wedding invitation .
 Now barely 100 people had seen that invitation .
 The Mayfly Man only saw five women .
 For one person to be in both groups ... could be a coincidence .
 Oh , Sherlock !
 What do we say about coincidences ?
 The universe is rarely so lazy .
 So , the balance of probability is ?
 Someone went to great lengths to find out something about this wedding .
 What great lengths ?
 They lied .
 Assumed false identities .
 Which suggests ?
 Criminal intent . Also suggests ?
 Intelligence , planning .
 Clearly .
 But more importantly ? The Mayfly Man .
 The Mayfly Man is ...
 Here today !
 Ooh , sorry . I ...
 Another glass , sir ?
 Thank you , yes , thank you .
 Yes . Something 's going to happen , right here .

 Now , where were we ?
 Could be any second .

 You have control of the room .
 Ah , yes .
 Raising glasses and standing up .
 Very good . Thank you . Don 't lose it .
 And down again .

 Ladies and gentlemen , people tell you not to milk a good speech .
 Get off early , leave 'em laughing .
 Wise advice I 'll certainly try to bear in mind . But for now ... part two !
 Part two is more action- based .
 I 'm going to walk around , shake things up a bit .
 Who 'd go to a wedding ?
 That 's the question .







 Who would bother to go to any lengths to get themselves to a wedding ?






















 Well , everyone .





 Weddings are great , love a wedding .






 What 's he doing ?
 Something 's wrong .






 And John 's great too .
 Haven 't said that enough , barely scratched the surface .
















 I could go on all night about the depth and complexity of his jumpers , and he can cook .









































 Does ... erm ... a thing .
 A thing with peas ... Once .







 Might not be peas , might not be him .
 But he 's got a great singing voice , or somebody does .






 Too many , too many , too many , too many !
















 Sorry , too many jokes about John .





















 Now ...
 Criminal intent . Where was I ? Ah , yes .
 Extraordinary lengths .
 Speech . Speech .
 Let 's talk about ...
 All of which is suggestive of ...
 Murder !
 Sorry , did I say murder ? I meant to say marriage .
 But , you know , they 're quite similar procedures , when you think about it .
 The participants tend to know each other and it 's over when one of them 's dead .
 In fairness , murder is a lot quicker though .
 Janine , what about this one ? Acceptably hot ?
 More importantly , his girlfriend 's wearing new uncomfortable underwear and hasn 't bothered to pick this thread off his jacket , or point out the grease smudge on his neck .

 He 's going home alone .
 Also he 's a comics and sci- fi geek , they 're always tremendously grateful , really put the hours in .
 Jeff , the gents . Loos now , please .
 Greg .
 The loos , please .
 Why ? Oh , I don 't know , maybe it 's your TURN .
 Yeah , actually , now you mention it .
 Sherlock , any chance of a ...

 An end date for this speech ? Got to cut the cake .
 Oh , ladies and gentlemen , can 't stand it when I finally get the chance to speak for once .
 Vatican cameos .
 What did he say ? What does that mean ?
 Battle stations , someone 's going to die .
 What ? !
 Narrow it down .
 Narrow it down .

 Narrow it down !









 Argh ! No , no !
 Not you !










 You .
 It 's always you . John Watson , you keep me right .
 What do I do ?
 You 've already done it .
 Don 't solve the murder .
 Save the life .
 Sorry , off piste a bit .
 Back now . Phew !
 Let 's play a game .
 Let 's play murder . Sherlock !
 Imagine someone 's going to get murdered at a wedding .
 Who exactly would you pick ?
 I think you 're a popular choice at the moment , dear .
 If someone could move Mrs Hudson 's glass just slightly out of reach , that would be lovely .
 More importantly , who could you only kill at a wedding ?
 Most people you can kill any old place . As a mental exercise ,
 I 've often planned the murder of friends and colleagues .
























 Now , John , I 'd poison . Sloppy eater , dead easy .
 I 've given him chemicals and compounds , that way he 's never even noticed .




















 He missed a whole Wednesday once , didn 't have a clue .













 Lestrade 's so easy to kill it 's a miracle no- one 's succumbed to the temptation .


















 I 've got keys to my brother 's house , I could break in and asphyxiate him , if the whim arose .









 He 's pissed , isn 't he ?




















 Ow !
 So , once again , who could you only kill here ?






 Clearly it 's a rare opportunity , so it 's someone who doesn 't get out much .



























 Someone for whom a planned social encounter known about months in advance is an exception .
















 Has to be a unique opportunity .









 And since killing someone in public is difficult , killing them in private isn 't an option .












 Someone who lives in an inaccessible or unknown location , then .




 Someone private perhaps , obsessed with personal security .
 Possibly someone under threat .

 Major James Sholto , who he ?
 I don 't think he 's coming . He 'll be there .
 Where are you living these days ?
 Oh , way out in the middle of nowhere .
 The press and families gave him hell . He gets more death threats than you .

 A recluse ?
 Small household staff .
 Job ? Gardener . Cook .
 Private nurse .
 Maid .
 High turnover for additional security .
 I do security work .
 Probably all signed confidentiality agreements .
 Do you have a secret you 've never told anyone ?
 ALL :
 No .
 There is another question that remains .
 Rather a big one , a huge one - how would you do it ?
 How do you kill someone in public ?
 There has to be a way .
 This has been planned .
 Mr Holmes ! Hello , Archie , what 's your theory ?
 Get this right and there 's a headless nun in it for you .
 The invisible man could do it .
 The who , what , why , when , where ?
 The invisible man with the invisible knife .
 The one who tried to kill the Guardsman .






 Bainbridge ?
 Bainbridge !


 ( Oh , not just planned - planned and rehearsed . )
 Ladies and gentlemen , there will now be a short interlude . The bride and groom ...

 ALL :
 The bride and groom .
 Major Sholto 's going to be murdered , I don 't know how or by whom , but it 's going to happen .
 Excuse me , coming through .
 Consulting . Stay here .
 Please be careful . Excuse me .
 Coming through .
 Excuse me .
 I 'm sorry , one more .
 Oops . I 'm so sorry . Thank you .

 How can you not remember which room ? You remember everything . I have to delete something !
 207 .
 Major Sholto ?
 Major Sholto ! Major Sholto !
 If someone 's about to make an attempt on my life , it won 't be the first time .
 I 'm ready . Major , let us in .
 Kick the door down . I really wouldn 't .
 I have a gun in my hand and a lifetime of unfortunate reflexes .
 You 're not safe in there .
 Whoever 's after you , we know a locked room doesn 't stop him .
 The invisible man with the invisible knife .
 I don 't know how he does it .
 I can 't stop him and that means he 'll do it again !
 Solve it , then !
 I 'm sorry ?
 You 're the famous Mr Holmes , solve the case , on you go .
 Tell me how he did it and I 'll open the door .
 Please , this is no time for games , just let us in , you 're in danger !
 So are you , so long as you 're here .
 Please , leave me .
 Despite my reputation , I really don 't approve of collateral damage .
 Solve it . Sorry ?
 Solve it and he 'll open the door , like he said .
 I couldn 't solve it before , how can I solve it now ?
 Because it matters now . What are you talking about ?
 Get your wife under control !
 She 's right . Oh , you 've changed ! No , she is .
 Shut up !
 You are not a puzzle- solver , you never have been .
 You 're a drama queen !
 Now , there 's a man in there about to die , the game is on - solve it !

 Bainbridge ?

 Bainbridge !

 Though in fairness , he 's a drama queen too . I know .
 Major Sholto , no- one 's coming to kill you .
 I 'm afraid you 've already been killed several hours ago .
 What did you say ?
 Don 't take off your belt .
 My belt ?
 His belt , yes .
 Bainbridge was stabbed hours before we even saw him , but it was through his belt .
 Tight belt , worn high on the waist .
 Very easy to push a small blade through the fabric and you wouldn 't even feel it .
 The belt would bind the flesh together when it was tied tight .
 Exactly .
 But when you took it off ... Delayed- action stabbing .
 All the time in the world to create an alibi .
 Major Sholto ? So ...

 I was to be killed by my uniform .
 How appropriate .
 He solved the case , Major , you 're supposed to open the door now .
 A deal is a deal .
 I 'm not even supposed to have this any more , they gave me special dispensation to keep it .
 I couldn 't imagine life out of this uniform .
 I suppose , given the circumstances , I don 't have to .

 When so many want you dead , it hardly seems good manners to argue .

 Whatever you 're doing in there , James , stop it , right now ! I will kick this door down !
 Mr Holmes , you and I are similar , I think .
 Yes , I think we are .
 There 's a proper time to die , isn 't there ?
 Of course there is .
 And one should embrace it when it comes .
 Like a soldier .
 Of course one should , but not at John 's wedding !

 We wouldn 't do that , would we , you and me ?
 We would never do that to John Watson .
 I 'm going to break it down .
 Wait , wait , wait , you won 't have to .

 I believe I am in need of medical attention . I believe I 'm your doctor .

 Pretty good .
 Just hold your nerve on your turning .
 Why do we have to rehearse ?
 Because we are about to dance together in public and your skills are appalling .
 SHE LAUGHS Wow , you 're a good teacher .
 Hmm .
 And you 're a brilliant dancer .
 Can I let you in on something , Janine ?
 Go on , then .
 I love dancing , I 've always loved it .
 Seriously ?
 Watch out .

 Oh !
 Never really comes up in crime work , but , you know , Oh , I wish you weren 't ... whatever it is you are . I live in hope of the right case .

 I know .
 Well , glad to see you 've pulled , Sherlock , what with murderers running riot at my wedding .
 One murderer ... One nearly murderer .
 Loves to exaggerate - you should try living with him .
 Sherlock .
 Got him for you .
 Ah , the photographer , excellent .
 Thank you . May I have a look at your camera ?
 Erm , what 's this about ?
 I was halfway home . You should have driven faster .
 Ah , yes .
 Yes ! Very good .
 Now you see ...
 Perfect . What is ? Are you going to tell us ?
 Try looking yourself .
 Look for what ?
 Is the murderer in these photographs ?
 It 's not what 's in the photographs , it 's what 's not in them .
 Not in any of them . Sherlock ?
 The showing- off thing , we 've discussed it before ...
 There is always a man at a wedding who is not in any photograph , who can go anywhere .
 And even carry an equipment bag around with him if he likes .
 And you never even see his face .
 You only ever see ...

 The camera .
 What are you doing ? What is this ?
 Jonathan Small , today 's substitute wedding photographer , known to us as the Mayfly Man .
 His brother was one of the raw recruits killed in that incursion .
 Johnny sought revenge on Sholto , worked his way through Sholto 's staff , found what he needed .
 An invitation to a wedding .
 The one time Sholto would have to be out in public .
 So he made his plan and rehearsed the murder , making sure of every last detail .
 Brilliant , ruthless , and almost certainly a monomaniac . Though , in fairness , his photographs are actually quite good .
 Everything you need is on that .
 You probably ought to arrest him or something .
 Do you always carry handcuffs ?
 Down , girl . Come on , quick .
 It 's not me you should be arresting , Mr Holmes .
 Oh , I don 't do the arresting , I just farm that out .
 Sholto , he 's the killer , not me .
 I should have killed him quicker .

 I shouldn 't have tried to be clever . You should have driven faster .

 Right .

 SOLO VlOLlN PLAYS

 APPLAUSE AND CHEERlNG
 Ladies and gentlemen , just one last thing before the evening begins properly .
 Apologies for earlier , a crisis arose and was dealt with .
 More importantly , however , today we saw two people make vows .
 I 've never made a vow in my life and after tonight I never will again .
 So , here in front of you all , my first and last vow .
 Mary and John , whatever it takes , whatever happens , from now on ,
 I swear I will always be there .
 Always .
 For all three of you . Erm ...
 Sorry , I mean ...
 I mean two of you . All two of you . Both of you , in fact .
 I just miscounted . Anyway , it 's time for dancing .
 Play the music again , please .
 Thank you . OK , everybody , just dance , don 't be shy .
 Dancing , please .
 Very good . Sorry , that was one more deduction than I was really expecting .
 Deduction ? Increased appetite ...
 I 'm starving . Change of taste perception .
 Oh , I chose this wine , but it 's bloody awful !
 You were sick this morning .
 You assumed it was just wedding nerves .
 You got angry with me when I mentioned it to you .
 All the signs are there .
 The signs ? The signs of three .
 What ?
 Mary , I think you should do a pregnancy test .
 Well , the statistics for the first trimester are ...
 Shut up !
 Just shut up .
 Sorry .
 How did he notice before me ?
 I 'm a bloody doctor . It 's your day off . It 's YOUR day off !
 Stop . Stop panicking .
 I 'm not panicking .
 I 'm pregnant , I 'm panicking ! Don 't panic .
 None of you panic .
 Absolutely no reason to panic .
 Oh , and you 'd know , of course ! Yes , I would .
 You 're already the best parents in the world ,
 look at all the practice you 've had .
 What practice ?
 Well , you 're hardly going to need me around now that you 've got a real baby on the way .
 Are you all right ?
 Yeah !
 Dance .
 Hmm ?
 Both of you now , go , dance .
 We can 't just stand here , people will wonder what we 're talking about .
