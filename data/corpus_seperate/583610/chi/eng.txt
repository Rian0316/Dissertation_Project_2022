 Chandler ! Chandler !
 I saw what you were doing in the window !
 I saw what you 're doing to my sister ! Get out here ! Listen , we had a good run .
 What was it ?
 Four , five months ?
 That 's more than most people have in a Iifetime . Goodbye . - What are you doing ?
 - I am going on the Iam . Come on , Chandler .
 I can handle Ross . Hold on !
 Hey , Ross .
 What 's up , bro ?
 What the heII are you doing ?
 What 's going on ?
 I think Ross knows about me and Monica .
 Dude , he 's right there .
 I thought you were my best friend !
 This is my sister ! My best friend and my sister ! I cannot believe this !
 We 're not just messing around .
 I love her . I 'm in love with her .
 I 'm so sorry that you had to find out this way .
 I 'm sorry , but it 's true . I love him too .

 My best friend and my sister !
 I cannot believe this !
 You guys want to probably get some hugs in too . Big news !
 We 've actuaIly known for a while .
 What ? You guys knew ?
 You aII knew and you didn 't teII me ? We were worried about you .
 We didn 't know how you were going to react .
 You were worried about me ?
 You didn 't know how I 'd react ? Okay .
 AII right .
 Let 's clear out of here and Iet these love birds get back to business .
 I 'm just talking here . He 's the one doing your sister .
 The One with the GirI Who Hits Joey English Subtitles by GELULA & CO . , INC .
 You know what I just realized ?
 If you guys have kids --
 We 're having kids ?
 I caII godfather !
 You can 't just caII godfather .
 Shouldn 't her brother be godfather ?
 Sure . If you cared enough to caII it first .
 - You 're a few steps ahead of us .
 - Big zero gravity moon steps .
 I just thought of the greatest wedding gift . I 'II go in on that with you .
 I couldn 't decide . Hey , Katie .
 This is Katie . You ready to go ?
 I 'II run to the bathroom . Where 's Iunch ?
 I was thinking Chinese food . I love Chinese !
 How did you know I love Chinese ?


 She is so cute .
 You could fit her in your pocket .
 I don 't know . I Iike her a Iot , and she 's reaIly nice , but . . . .
 But what ?
 She keeps punching me .
 In the cute Iittle , sweet way she just did ?
 It 's a Iot harder than it Iooks .
 She 's hurting me . I know what you need .
 You need a bodyguard . What is Ben doing after preschool ?
 Joey is having a problem .
 A Iittle girI is beating him up .
 Joey , come here .
 Honey , I know . This must be reaIly difficult for you , and --
 I 'm sorry , am I hurting you ?


 I brought you some housewarming gifts .
 Salt , so your Iife always has flavor .
 Bread , so you never go hungry .
 And a scented candle for the bathroom .
 Because , weIl , you know . Thanks .
 Thanks . And thanks , I guess .
 Welcome .
 I 'm Steve Cera , President of the tenants ' committee .
 Ross GeIler . And this is my friend Phoebe .
 Mr. President . I came to talk to you about Howard .
 He is the handyman who 's retiring next week .
 Everyone who Iives here is kicking in $ 1 00 as a kind of a thank you .
 That 's nice . Want to give me a check ?

 Not now . You can slip it under my door .
 No , it 's not that . I just moved in .
 WeIl , the guy 's worked here for 25 years .
 Yes , but I 've Iived here for 25 minutes .

 Okay , I get it .
 Wait ! Look , I 'm sorry , it 's just I 've never even met Howard .
 I mean , I don 't know Howard .
 Howard 's the handyman .
 Yes , but to me he 's just " man . "
 Okay . Fine . Whatever .
 Welcome to the building .
 Can you believe that guy ?
 I reaIly Iike his glasses .
 So then President Steve told everyone I was a cheapskate . . . . . . and now the whole building hates me .
 A Iittle kid spit on my knee .
 You know what ? I 'II throw a party . For everyone in the building .
 And I 'II sit them aII down and explain that I am not a bad guy . I am not a cheap guy .
 I 'm just a guy . . . . . . who stands up for what he believes in .
 A man with principles .
 Sounds Iike a fun party .
 If you want them to Iike you , why don 't you just pay the $ 1 00 ?
 The party wiII cost you more . That doesn 't matter ! It 's my principles !
 We 're talking about my principles !
 I thought it was about your neighbors Iiking you .
 They 'II Iike me once they come to my awesome par- tay .
 I gotta get some name tags .


 And that crazy party animaI wiII be your brother- in- Iaw .
 Very funny . But don 't say that to Monica .
 Don 't put any ideas in her head . You do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica 's head ?
 Why ?
 WeIl , because she Ioves you and because you love her . Yeah , so ? What 's that supposed to mean ?
 Don 't freak out !
 I 'm teIling you something you already know .
 She Ieft Richard because he didn 't want to have babies . And she is a woman . And she 's almost 30 .
 And , you know , it 's Monica .
 I don 't see it that way . I see two Monicas : My friend who Iives across the haII and wants a Iot of babies .
 And the new Monica who I started to date .
 Now , who is to say what she wants ?
 I 'm right .
 Am I right ? You 're right .
 You 're absolutely right . That makes everything different .
 It 's not different , is it ? Not unless " different " means the same .

 You were so funny with that waiter . You 're such a nut !


 You know , breadstick fangs are always funny .
 No , you make them funny . You 're the funny one !

 Look , Katie . Listen , we need to talk , okay ?
 Look , I Iike you . I reaIly do . I Iike you a Iot .
 But sometimes when you playfuIly punch me Iike that . . . . . . it feels Iike I 'm being hit with a very tiny but a very reaI bat !
 Like I could hurt you .
 Are you making fun of my size ? Don 't make fun of me because of my size !

 Isn 't this great ?
 Couldn 't you just stay Iike this forever ? Couldn 't you just stay here forever ?
 Yeah , here , somewhere else .
 You know , wherever . Are you okay ? I 'm cool .
 Casual .
 What are you doing ?
 Just hanging out . Having fun with the girI that I 'm seeing casuaIly .
 Man , I knew it !
 I knew you 'd do this .
 Get aII freaked out because everybody was joking about marriage !
 WeIl , you do want aII that stuff , right ? You know what I want ?
 Yes !
 You want babies ! You have baby fever !
 I do not have baby fever !
 You 're obsessed with babies and marriage . . . . . . and everything that 's related to babies and marriage .
 Why don 't we turn the heat down on this pressure cooker !
 Have you Iost your mind ?
 This isn 't about me . This is about you and your weird commitment crap !
 I know you .
 I know the thoughts that you have in your head .
 You don 't know everything .
 Did you know I 'm going out with RacheI tonight instead of you ?
 And that the only baby here is you ? Did you know I can 't even Iook at you now ?
 I did not know that .

 It 'II be okay , right ? She won 't Ieave me .
 This is fixable . - Yeah , sure . - Absolutely .
 By me ?

 Unless you make some big gesture .
 Big , though . The missus !
 Gunther , can I get a coffee ?
 To go .
 I stiII don 't want to talk to you .
 TeII me how to make things right . That 's what we do .
 I mess up , you teII me how to fix it and I do .
 And then you think I 'm cute again .
 I 'm reaIly tired of being your relationship tutor .
 Figure this out for yourself .
 If you 're afraid of a reaI relationship . . . . . . then don 't be in one .










 Howard !
 Howard !
 Howard !
 Hi , Ross !
 What are you doing here ?
 I thought this was your party , and it 's a party for Howard .
 He 's the sweetest Iittle man .
 See you , Phoebe .
 And thanks for chipping in .
 Oh , sure .
 You chipped in ? Yeah , $ 1 00 .
 I can 't believe you gave him money .
 I thought you agreed it was unreasonable that they asked me for that money .
 But they didn 't ask me .
 I 'm just the exotic , generous stranger .
 That 's always fun to be . But you 're making me Iook bad .
 No , I 'm not !
 If anything , I 'm making you Iook better . They 'II see you talking to me .
 I 'm a hit .
 Hey , Pheebs ! Hey , Ross .
 Maybe you two could switch apartments .
 Because Phoebe is more our kind of people .
 Think about it .
 Okay , my bad .




 You Iook big .
 Thanks , I 've been working out .
 Listen , is it obvious I 'm wearing six sweaters ?
 But it 's not obvious why .
 I 'm breaking up with Katie , so I put on some extra padding .
 If she hits me when she is happy , can you imagine how hard she 'II hit . . . . . . when I take away the Joey Iove ?
 Hey , cute jacket .
 Thanks .
 - That 's so sweet !
 - Ouch !

 Did Joey teII you to say that ?
 You guys are too much ! You know what ?
 I got to teII you . . . . . . I think you 're the one that is too much .
 Joey has the nicest friends .
 And the nicest girlfriend .
 You 're so sweet !
 You 're so sweet !


 She just kicked me .
 Aren 't you going to do something ?
 Do something or I 'II walk out that door right now .
 Are you going to ?




 This is a disaster . Can 't I please just go ?
 I 'm talking you up to people .
 Give it some time , relax .
 Get something to eat .
 What did you teII them about me ? I told them about you and Emily .
 Trying to get some sympathy . But you came off as the bad guy .
 I told it wrong .
 We should talk about that , because I don 't understand what happened there .
 This cake is reaIly good !
 Things are Iooking up .
 Oh , my God !
 Someone cut Howard 's cake !
 Who would do a thing Iike that ?

 3- B.
 You got your free food .
 You ruined everyone 's fun . Isn 't it time you went home ?
 Go back to 3- B , 3- B.
 Everyone , calm down !
 I have something that I 'd Iike to say . Who here Iikes Ross ?


 Of course you don 't Iike him . He didn 't give you any money .
 He raised his own hand when I asked , " Who Iikes Ross ? " And he 's wearing two name tags .
 I 'II be honest .
 When I first met Ross , I didn 't Iike him at aIl .
 Once I got to know him , I saw that he is reaIly sweet . . . . . . and caring and very generous .
 AII I 'm saying is don 't judge Ross before you get to know him .
 You know , I Iike aII of you guys now . But when I first met you , you know ? Kurt ?
 I thought , abrasive drunk .
 Lola ?
 Mind- numbingly stupid .
 You guys .
 Gold digger , cradle- robbing perv .
 So I think you aII know what I mean .
 Obviously , I didn 't think they would throw things .
 I thought if I kept insulting them you 'd defend them .
 Then you 'd Iook Iike the hero .
 See , I did not get that .
 Where 's Monica ?
 I need to talk to her , it 's urgent . I 'm Monica .
 I need to talk to you .
 It 's urgent . I 've been thinking . . . . . . about us .
 A Iot of " us " thinking . I guess there 's only one way to do this .

 What are you doing ?
 Don 't do it .
 WiII you marry me ? What a bad idea .
 I can 't not Iook at it .
 Why are you doing this ?
 I don 't know . But I know I 'm not afraid to do this .
 I 'm doing this because I 'm sorry ?
 Do you think the best reason to get married is because you 're sorry ?
 The best reason is pregnancy .
 Sorry is fourth , behind being ready and actuaIly wanting to get married .
 WiII you be my wife ?
 I want you to take a minute and think about how ridiculous this sounds .
 I 'm kind of wishing everyone wasn 't here now .
 None of that came from me .
 I never said I wanted to have babies and get married !
 I was reaIly confused . Then I talked to these guys . Who ?
 Two divorces and Joey ? She 's right , you know ?
 Yeah , but stiIl , cheap shot !
 You know when I said that I want you . . . . . . to deaI with relationship stuff aII on your own ?
 You 're not ready . I didn 't think I was !

 Oh , my God .
 What would you have done if I had said yes ? I would 've been happy because . . . . . . I would spend the rest of my Iife with the woman I Iove .
 Or you would have seen a Chandler- shaped hole in that door .

 WiII you pass that knife ?
 No , I wiII not .
 You don 't have to be mean about it . You 're right . I 'm sorry .
 WiII you marry me ?
 I was going to ask you to marry me because I didn 't say heIlo to you .
 Or ask them to move in with you .
 But I 'm not sure . Chandler ?
 How Iong is this going to go on ?
 I think the Iength of teasing . . . . . . is directly related to how insane you were .
 So , a Iong time .
 This is fun !
 Remember that " we were on a break " thing ? I 'm sorry .
 WiII you marry me ?

 That 's not funny .
