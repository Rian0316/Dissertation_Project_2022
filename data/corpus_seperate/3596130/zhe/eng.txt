 Damn you, walletnook . Com !
 Problem ?
 The online description was completely misleading .
 They said eight slots, plus removable id .
 To any rational person, that would mean room for nine cards , but they don 't tell you, the removable id takes up one slot .
 It 's a nightmare !
 Okay, now, do you really need the honorary justice league of america membership card ?
 It 's been in every wallet I 've owned since I was five .
 Why ?
 It says " keep this on your person at all times . "
 it 's right here under batman 's signature .
 And this is leonard and sheldon 's apartment .
 Guess whose parents just got broadband .
 Leonard, may I present, live from new delhi, dr . And mrs . V. M. Koothrappali .
 Hi ! Tilt up the camera up !
 I 'm looking at his crotch . Sorry, papa .
 Oh, that 's much better .
 - Hi . - Hi !
 And over here is sheldon .
 Hi ! He lives with leonard .
 Oh, that 's nice .
 Like haroon and tanvir . No, no . Not like haroon and tanvir .
 Such sweet young men .
 They just adopted the cutest little punjabi baby .
 No, we 're not like haroon and tanvir .
 So, are you boys academics like our son ?
 Yes .
 And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential ?
 - Oh, yes . - Not at all .
 Papa, please . Don 't start .
 It was just a question . He 's so sensitive . Okay, that 's my life .
 That 's my friends . Good to see you . Say good- bye .
 - Bye .
 - Bye .
 Wait !
 Wait ! Before you go, we have good news .
 Put the computer down and gather your friends .

 - What is it, papa ? - friends .

 Is it just me, or does web chatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless ?
 Rajesh, do you remember lalita gupta ?
 The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable ? Yes .
 Well, now she 's a dental student at usc , so we gave her your contact information .
 Why did you do that ? You 're 26 years old, rajesh . We want grandchildren .
 But, papa, I 'm not supposed ...
 lalita 's parents approved the match .
 If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season . A spring wedding ? It 's up to you, dear .
 We don 't want to meddle . If you don 't want to meddle, then why are you meddling ?
 If I may, your parents probably don 't consider this meddling .
 While arranged marriages are no longer the norm , indian parents continue to have a greater- than- average involvement in their children 's love lives .
 Why are you telling me about my own culture ?
 You seemed confused .
 Sorry, mumi, papa, but with all due respect ,
 - I really don 't want to ... - I 'm sorry, darling . We have to go .
 Doogie howser is on .
 Grandma !
 It 's doogie time !
 - Bye- bye !
 - Bye- bye !

 I don 't believe it .
 Neither do I. Doogie howser 's been off the air for like 20 years .

 Actually, I read somewhere that it 's one of the most popular programs in india .
 It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one 's children enter the medical profession .
 I bet you 're right .
 I bet they love scrubs .
 What 's not to love ? Excuse me !
 Hello ?
 My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger .
 What am I going to do ?
 I suggest you go through with it .
 What ?
 Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the 19th century .
 Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well .
 It 's the entire premise of fiddler on the roof .
 I 'm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show .
 Me too .
 Of course, it speaks to me culturally .
 Understandable, but there 's a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity .
 Let 's not forget it 's got some really catchy tunes . - oh, absolutely .
 - Yeah ! Okay, I know what I 'm going to do .
 What ? Find new friends .





 so who wants to rent fiddler ?
 No need, we have the special edition .
 Well, maybe we are like haroon and tanvir .










 this is dr . Sheldon cooper .
 Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the planetarium .

 Well, I 'm sorry, too, but there 's just no room for you in my wallet .
 I understand, but it was between you and the museum of natural history , and frankly, you don 't have dinosaurs .



 I 'll miss you, too .
 Bye- bye .
 Okay, I know you 're texting about me and I 'd really like you to stop .
 oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed .
 Hey, I thought you were finding new friends .
 I 've got some feelers out .
 In the meantime, listen to this .
 Hi, rajesh .
 This is lalita gupta .
 Uh, your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me .
 So, I 'm calling you and, uh, call me back .
 Bye . Can you believe how pushy she is ?

 So don 't call her .
 If I don 't call her, I won 't hear the end of it from my parents .
 So call her . How can I call her ?
 You know I can 't talk to women .
 I 'm done .
 Anybody else ?
 - Give me the phone .
 - Why ?
 Just give it to me .
 What are you doing ?
 Don 't worry . You 'll thank me .
 Hello, lalita ? Raj koothrappali here .

 Yes, it is good to talk to you, too .
 So what are you wearing ?
 Oh, not important .
 Uh, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet ?
 Friday works for me !
 I 'll call you with a time and place .
 But in the meantime, keep it real, babe .

 You may now thank me .
 For what ?
 Making me sound like a simpsons character ?
 Fine . Next time make your own date .
 I didn 't want to make this one !
 Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl . Great, then we 'll get married ,
 I won 't be able to talk to her and we 'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence .
 It worked for my parents .

 - hi, guys . - Oh, hey .
 I need some guinea pigs .
 Okay, there 's a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try .
 But if your research is going to have human applications , may I suggest white mice instead ?
 Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours .
 I swear to god, sheldon, one day ,
 I 'm going to get the hang of talking to you .
 His mom 's been saying that for years .

 What 's up ? Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bartending shift , so I need to practice mixing drinks .
 Oh, great .
 Well, the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition .
 With certain obvious exceptions .
 Suicide, for example .

 So, leonard, how about it ?

 You know, penny, we 'd love to help you , but raj is going through some stuff right now , and besides, he doesn 't drink, so ... really ?







 Um, raj is going through some stuff right now and he 'd like to take up drinking .


 Okay, here you go, leonard .
 One tequila sunrise . Thank you .
 You know, this drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container .
 Thank you .
 Okay, raj, what 'll it be ?

 Whatever you recommend .
 Uh, how about a grasshopper ?
 I make a mean grasshopper .
 Okay ?
 Good . Coming up . Sheldon, what are you going to have ?
 I 'll have a diet coke .
 Okay, can you please order a cocktail ?
 I need to practice mixing drinks .
 Fine .
 I 'll have a virgin cuba libre .
 That 's, um, rum and coke without the rum .
 Yes .
 - So ... coke .
 - Yes .
 And would you make it diet ?
 There 's a can in the fridge .
 A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge .
 Then swim to cuba .
 Bartenders are supposed to have people skills .
 Okay .
 Raj, here you go . All right . Who 's next ?
 I 'd like to try a slippery nipple .

 Okay, you 're cut off .
 Anybody need a refill ?
 Where did my life go, penny ?
 One day I 'm a carefree bachelor , and the next I 'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi .

 Are you talking to me ?
 Is there another penny here ?
 I had such plans .
 I had dreams . I was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astrophysics .
 But with a penis, of course .

 Amazing .
 Ever since I was a little boy , my father wanted me to be a gynecologist like him .
 How can I be a gynecologist ? I can barely look a woman in the eye !


 You know what ?
 I 'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer .
 It 's time for a showdown .
 Somebody give me a computer with a webcam !
 Okay, sweetie, I think that 's the grasshopper talking .
 And it 's about to tell my parents that
 I 'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with lalita gupta .
 Okay, calm down .
 Look, no one can make you get married .
 Why don 't you just meet this girl and see what happens ?
 Haven 't you been listening to me ?
 I cannot talk to women .
 Um, raj ... no, no, let 's see how long it takes him .

 Um, raj, honey, you say you can 't talk to women , but you 've been talking to me .
 And now we 'll never know .
 You 're right .
 I ... I am talking to you .
 Hello, penny, how are you ?
 I 'm fine .
 Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a lalita before I meet the grasshopper .

 It 's a sweet, green miracle .
 Okay, if you 're going to drink on this date , just promise me you won 't overdo it .
 Overdo what ?
 Happiness ? Freedom ?
 This warm glow inside of me that promises everything 's going to be all hunky- dunky ?
 Yeah, that .
 Why don 't you bring her to my restaurant while I 'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you .
 Okay . Wait a minute .

 What 's the plan here ?
 Let 's say he meets her, he likes her, they get married . What 's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life ?
 Worked for my parents .





 I can 't believe I 'm sitting here next to little lalita gupta .
 Well, you are .
 Little lalita .
 That 's fd of kinun to say .
 Little lalita, little lalita, little lalita .
 You should try it . Oh, it 's okay .
 You have lost so much weight .
 That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat .

 Do you remember ?
 Yes, I do . Of course you do .
 Who could forget being that fat ?
 Well, I 've been trying .
 So you 're a dental student .

 Mm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate ?
 Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but, then , there are far mo dreentists than air traffic controllers , so in pure numbers, you 're still winning .
 Yay, me .
 Do you have a drink that will make him less obnoxious ?
 Drinks do not work that way .
 I 'd say he 's doing fine . Look at her .
 The last girl my mom set me up with had a mustache and a vestigial tail .
 Sorry I 'm late .
 What happened ?
 Nothing .
 I just really didn 't want to come .
 Virgin diet cuba libre, please .
 Okay .
 In a tall glass with a lime wedge .
 Oh, I 'll wedge it right in there .
 So how 's koothrappali ... oh, my lord .
 What ?
 That 's princess panchali .
 I 'm pretty sure her name 's lalita .
 No, no, princess panchali, from the monkey and the princess .
 Oh, yeah .
 I tried to watch that online, but they wanted my credit card .
 It 's a children 's story .
 Oh, no, it isn 'T .
 When I was a little boy and got sick , which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me .
 It 's about an indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different .
 For some reason, I related to it quite strongly .
 I know the reason .
 We all know the reason .
 Sheldon, what are you getting at ?
 That woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess panchali in the book .
 How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life ?


 Every year at comic- con .
 Every day at disneyland .
 You can hire snow white to come to your house .
 Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid .
 Hey, guys .
 Isth is lalita gupta .
 Lalita, this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny .
 Isn 't it great ?
 She isn 't fat anymore .
 Forgive me, your highness, for I am but a monkey , and it is in my nature to climb
 I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair .
 I 'm sorry ?
 You are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess panchali .
 Oh, no kidding . Who ... who is that ?

 A beloved character from an indian folktale .
 Us indian or " come to our casino " indian ?
 You indian .
 The resemblance is remarkable .
 I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair .
 Well, thanks .
 I imagine you smell very nice, too .
 I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can .
 Really ? So do I.
 But you 're a dentist . He 's nuts .
 Don 't be insulting, rajesh .
 So, sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like .
 It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips .

 Oh, my .
 Back off, sheldon .
 What ?
 If you do not stop hitting on my lady , you will feel the full extent of my wrath .
 I 'm not hitting on her .
 And I am not your lady .
 And you have no wrath .
 You are my lady . Our parents said so .
 We are, for all intents and purposes, 100 % hooked up . Okay, let 's get something straight here .
 The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case .
 I certainly don 't need to be getting this old world crap from you .
 That 's exactly the kind of spirit with which princess panchali led the monkeys to freedom .
 Screw princess panchali .
 Hey, you can 't talk to me like that . But you 're not princess panchali .
 Luckily for you -- she could have you beheaded .
 Sheldon, are you hungry ?
 I could eat .
 Let 's go .
 What just happened ?
 Beats the hell out of me .
 I 'll tell you what happened . I just learned how to pick up indian chicks .
 What are we supposed to say to lalita 's parents ?
 I play golf with her father .
 I won 't be able to look at him .
 Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, papa .
 Oh, now you 're a funny man . This is not funny, mr . Funny man .
 Dr. And mrs . Koothrappali, in all fairness , it wasn 't entirely raj 's fault . This is a family matter, sheldon .
 I 'm leonard . Oh, sorry .
 You all look alike to us .
 But he 's right, papa .
 Listen to him .
 You !
 You are the one who ruined everything . Who is it ?
 We can 't see .
 Turn us .
 Turn us .
 Go ahead, tell my parents why they won 't have any grandchildren .
 How would I know ? Do you have a low sperm count ?
 This has nothing to do with my sperm count .
 You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren 't you, rajesh ?
 Yes, mumi .
 Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear tighty- whities .
 Can we please stop talking about my testicles ? Sheldon, tell them what you did .
 What did I do ?
 You left with his date . Friends don 't do that to each other .

 All right, noted .

 Sorry .
 Sorry ?
 That 's all you can say is sorry ? Take it, raj .
 It 's more than I 've ever gotten .
 And may I point out, she woavdn 't hule asked me to go with her if you hadn 't been drunk and boring .
 Drunk ?
 And boring -- her words .
 I knew it .
 He moves to america and he becomes an alcoholic .
 I 'm not an alcoholic .
 Then why were you drunk ?
 It was just this one time, papa, I swear .
 Are you in denial ? Do we have to come over and do an intervention ?

 Don 't embarrass him in front of his friends .
 All right . Carry us outside .
 We want to talk to you in private .
 - But, papa, please ...
 - now, rajesh !



 I have to go .


 Now, listen to me ... at least wait till I get into the hall .

 okay, well, good night .
 Hold on .
 What happened with you and lalita ?
 We ate, she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks -- nothing I didn 't already know -- and I came home .

 So you 're not going to see her again ?
 Why would I see her again ?
 I already have a dentist .

 I wonder who 's going to tell his parents they 're not having grandchildren ?

 To life, to life, l 'chaim
 I 'chaim, l 'chaim, to life
 life has a way of amusing us blessing and bruising us drink ,
 I 'chaim, to li ... fe .

 What 's gotten into him ? maybe a couple virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty . I don 't believe it .



 You didn 'T . Hey, you do your experiments .
 I do mine .
