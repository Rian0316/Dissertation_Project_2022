 Oh , that is so sweet !

 Oh , gosh . I love you . Okay , insurance ?

 Yeah , check it . Definitely gonna want some of that ! You don 't have insurance ?
 Why ?
 How much wiII this cost ?
 X- rays alone could be a couple hundred doIlars !
 - What 'II we do ?
 - There 's not much we can do .
 Unless I use yours .

 Now wait a second . Who did I just put as my " in case of emergency " person ?
 That 's insurance fraud .
 AII right then , forget it . Might as weII just go home .

 - Okay , come here .
 I hate this . - Thank you . I love you .
 I 'm gonna need a new set of these forms .
 Why ?
 I am reaIly an idiot !
 I was fiIling out my friend 's form . . . . . . and instead of putting her information . . . . . . I put mine .
 You are an idiot . Yep , that 's me .
 I am that stupid .
 I had a dream that I was playing footbaII with my kid . That 's nice .

 No , no . With him .
 I 'm on this field , and they hike me the baby .
 I 've gotta do something because the Tampa Bay team 's coming right at me !
 Tampa Bay 's got a terrible team .
 Right , but . . . . . . it is just me and the baby , so I 'm thinking they can take us .
 And so , I. . . . . . I just heave it downfield !
 What are you , crazy ? That 's a baby !
 He should take the sack ?
 Anyway . . . . . . suddenly I 'm downfield .
 And I realize that I 'm the one who 's suppose to catch him , right ?
 Only I know I 'm not gonna get there in time .
 So I am running and I 'm running . . . . . . and that is when I woke up .
 See , I am so not ready to be a father .
 Hey , you 're gonna be fine .
 You 're one of the most caring , responsible men in North America . You 're gonna make a great dad .
 Yeah , Ross .
 You and the baby just need better blocking .
 Have you ever been to the Rainbow Room ? Is it expensive ?
 Only if you order stuff .
 I 'm taking Ursula tonight . It 's her birthday .
 - What about Phoebe 's birthday ?
 - When 's that ?
 Tonight .
 Man , what are the odds of that happening ?
 You take your time .
 There it is !
 What 'II you do ? What can I do ?
 I don 't want to screw it up with Ursula .
 And your friend , Phoebe ?
 If she 's my friend , she 'II understand . Wouldn 't you guys ?
 If you tried that on my birthday . . . . . . you 'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit .
 An added pinch of saffron makes aII the difference .
 Monica ?
 Yes ? Yes , she is .
 This is my friend , Rachel .
 Hi , I 'm Dr. MitcheIl .
 And I 'm his friend , Dr. Rosen .
 Aren 't you a Iittle cute to be a doctor ?
 Excuse me ?
 God , young , young . I meant young . Young to be a doctor .
 - Good , Rach . - Thank you .
 He said it was a sprain , and that was it .
 You Ieft out the stupid part .
 It 's not stupid .
 The very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night , and I said yes .
 I think it 's totaIly insane . They work for the hospital .
 It 's Iike returning to the scene of the crime .
 - I say we blow off the dates .
 - What ?
 Monica , they are cute . They are doctors . Cute doctors .
 Doctors who are cute .
 AII right , what have we Iearned so far ?
 Oh , God .
 Surprise !
 What are you doing ? You scared the crap out of me ! - Was that the cake ?

 She 'II be here any minute .
 I hope it 's okay .
 " Happy Birthday , Peehee . "
 Maybe we can make a " B " out of a rose .
 Yeah , we 'II just use our speciaI cake tools .

 This is so great !
 This was not at aII scary .
 Hi , everybody . Hi , Betty ! Betty , hi !
 You found Betty !
 Oh , my gosh !
 This is so great .
 Everybody I love is in the same room . Where 's Joey ?
 Did you see Betty ?
 I wouldn 't mind having a piece of this sun- dried tomato business .
 Years ago , if somebody 'd said , " Here 's a tomato that Iooks Iike a prune " . . . . . . I 'd have said , " Get out of my office ! "
 Dad , before I was born , did you freak out at aIl ?
 I 'm not freaking out ! I 'm just saying . . . . . . if someone had come to me with the idea --
 I 'm talking about the whole baby thing .
 Did you ever get this sort of . . . . . . panicky , " Oh , my God , I 'm gonna be a father " kind of a thing ?
 Your mother did the work .
 I was busy with the business . I wasn 't around that much .
 Is that what this is about ? No , no .
 I was just wondering .
 There 's time to make up for that . We can do stuff together .
 You always wanted to go to coloniaI WiIliamsburg . How about we do that ?
 Thanks , Dad , reaIly . You know , I just , I just . . . .
 I just needed to know . . . . . . when did you start to feeI Iike a father ?
 WeIl , I guess it must have been the day after you were born .
 We were in the hospitaI room , your mother was asleep . . . . . . and they brought you in and gave you to me .
 You were this ugly Iittle red thing !
 And aII of a sudden , you grabbed my finger with your whole fist . . . . . . and you squeezed it . . . . . . so tight .
 And that 's when I knew . So you don 't want to go to WiIliamsburg ?

 We can go to WiIliamsburg .
 Eat your fish .
 Rachel , the cute doctors are here !
 Okay , coming .
 Hi , come on in .
 Hey , Michael , Jeffrey . We brought wine .

 Look at this . It 's from the ceIlars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine . - How could we resist ?
 - That 's great !
 - So , Monica , how 's the ankle ? - It 's . . . .

 Why don 't you teII them ?
 After aIl , it is your ankle .
 It 's feeling a Iot better .
 Thank you . Why don 't you guys sit down , and we 'II get you some glasses .
 Stat !
 Listen , why don 't we just teII them who we reaIly are ?
 - I think it 'II be fine . - It wiII not .
 We 'II get in trouble .
 Would you stop being such a wuss !
 A wuss ?
 Excuse me for Iiving in the reaI world . - So ?
 - So they stiII seem normal .
 Because they are .
 When we go out with women we meet at the hospital -- Would you relax ?
 Take a Iook around .
 There are no pagan altars .
 No piles of bones in the corners .
 They 're fine . Go Iike this :
 We are not going to do it , okay ? Sometimes you can be such a big baby !
 - I am not a baby . - Be serious . - You get uptight -- - You act Iike a princess .
 You know what ?
 You know what ?
 Every day you are becoming more and more Iike your mother .
 Excuse me . Here we go . This is a great place .
 How Iong have you Iived here ?
 Thanks . I 've been here about six years . And RacheI moved in a few months ago .
 See , I was supposed to get married . . . . . . but I Ieft the guy at the altar .
 Yeah , I know it 's pretty selfish , but . . . . . . hey , that 's me !
 Why don 't you try the hummus ?
 Monica , what do you do ?
 I am a chef at a restaurant uptown .
 Good for you .
 Yeah , it is .
 Mostly because I get to boss people around , which I just love to do .
 WeIl , this hummus is great .
 God bless the chickpea .
 Oh , God ! I am so spoiled !
 That 's it .
 And have I mentioned that back in high school . . . . . . I was a cow ?
 I used to wet my bed .
 I use my breasts to get other people 's attention .
 We both do that !
 Monica and Rachel 's apartment .
 Just one second . Rachel , it 's your dad .
 Hi , Dad . No , no .
 It 's me .
 Listen , Dad , I can 't talk right now .
 But there 's something . . . . There 's something I 've been meaning to teII you . Excuse me .
 Remember back in freshman year ?
 WeIl , BiIly Dreskin and I had sex on your bed .
 Daddy . . . . Why ?
 Why would I sleep with BiIly Dreskin ?
 His father tried to put you out of business !
 You are dead !
 Ross , he 's got the remote again .
 Good . Maybe he can switch it back .
 Maybe not .
 Hold on a second and Iet me just check and see if she 's here .
 It 's the woman from the hospital .
 There 's a problem with the form .
 Oh , God , what do we do ?
 Just find out what they want .
 Okay . No , you do it .
 HeIlo . This is Monica .
 Yes , we 'II be right down . Thank you .
 We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms .
 - You 're right , this wasn 't worth it . - Thank you .
 Let me just change .

 Trouble ?
 Your sister stood me up the other night .
 Oh , no . Don 't you hate it when people aren 't there for you ?
 - Did you try caIling her ?
 - I 've been trying for two days .
 When I caIled the restaurant , they said she was busy .
 I can 't believe she 's blowing me off !
 You got a minute ?
 Yeah , I 'm just working .


 I got you a birthday present .
 Wow , you remembered !
 It 's a Judy Jetson thermos .
 Like the kind you -- Right . Oh , I got something for you too .
 How 'd you know I was coming ?
 Yeah , twin thing .
 I can 't believe you did this .
 I can 't believe you . . . . . . did this !
 So what 's the deaI with you and Joey ?
 Oh , right . He is so great . But that 's over .
 - Does he know ? - Who ?
 Joey . You know , he 's reaIly nutsy about you .
 He is ? Why ?
 You got me .
 Excuse me . . . . . . doesn 't this come with a side salad ?
 So are you gonna caII him ?
 - You think he Iikes me ?
 - No .
 Joey .
 No , no . He is so smart . He 'II figure it out .
 Do you want some chicken ? No , no . No food with a face , remember ?
 You have not changed .
 Yeah , you too .
 Hi ! Remember us ?

 You just caIled about needing a signature on the admissions form ?
 WeIl , it turns out we need a whole new one .
 Because , you see . . . . . . I put the wrong name again .
 - Because -- - You 're that stupid !
 I am . I 'm that stupid !
 And I 'm just gonna pay for this with a check .
 Your insurance wiII cover that .
 Yeah , I know . I 'm just not that bright either .
 Okay , worst case scenario :
 Say you never feeI Iike a father .
 Say your son never feels connected to you as one .
 Say aII of his relationships are affected by this .
 Do you have a point ?
 You know , you 'd think I would . What 's up with the simian ?

 It 's just a fur baIl . Whose turn is it ?

 Yours . I got 43 points for " kidney . "
 No , you got zero points for " idney . "
 I had a " K. " Where 's my " K " ?
 You 've got to help me ! My monkey swaIlowed a " K " !
 Get that animaI out of here !
 The animaI hospitaI is across town . He 's choking !
 - What is it ? - MarceI swaIlowed a Scrabble tile .

 Excuse me . This hospitaI is for people !
 He is people ! He has a name , okay ?
 He watches Jeopardy ! ... . . . he touches himself when nobody 's watching .
 Please have a heart . - I 'II take a Iook at him .
 - Thank you . - Michael !
 - Rachel .
 - What ? - Monica .
 Urs ! I 've been trying to caII you .
 Listen . . . .
 Don 't say " Iisten . " I know that " Iisten . " I 've said that " Iisten . "
 I 'm sorry .
 I don 't get it . What happened ? What about what you said under the bridge ?
 Forget about what I said under the bridge . I was talking crazy that night . I was so drunk .
 You don 't drink .
 That 's right , I don 't .
 But I was drunk on you .

 But it 's not gonna work .
 Why ? Is it because I 'm friends with Phoebe ?
 If it was , would you stop hanging out with her ?
 No , I couldn 't do that .
 Then , yeah , it 's because of Phoebe .
 So you know , it 's either her or me .
 Then I 'm sorry .

 You 're gonna be reaIly hard to get over .
 I know .
 I don 't know whether it 's just because we 're breaking up or what . . . . . . but you 've never Iooked so beautiful .
 ReaIly ?
 Pheebs ?
 He Iooks so tiny .
 - We just got the message .
 - Is he okay ? The doctor got the " K " out .
 He also found an " M " and an " O. "
 We think he was trying to speII out " monkey . " The doctor says he 'II be fine .
 He 's just sleeping now .
 So you feeI Iike a dad yet ?
 No . Why ?
 Come on , you came through . You did what you had to do .
 That 's very " dad . "
 He 's waking up .
 Hey , feIla . How you doing ?
