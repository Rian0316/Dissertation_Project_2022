 00 : 00 : 02, 577 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 995 Hello , I 'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper . Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents :
 Fun with Flags .
 Before we get started , I 'd like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition .
 But I can 't .
 The only entry was from GameyGamer75 , and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks .
 Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise ,
 And to help me , I 'm pleased to introduce Internet personality , former star of
 and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in 1/ 16 scale -- set phasers to " fun " ... ... for my friend , Wil Wheaton .


 Hi , Sheldon .
 Thanks for having me . I 'm happy to be here .
 Cut . What 's wrong ?
 Sorry , Sheldon , you were brilliant as always .
 Wil , that was a little wooden .
 Wooden ?
 Don 't worry , it wasn 't terrible .
 Just , this time , try to say it the way people sound .
 And action . My friend , Wil Wheaton .
 Hi , Sheldon .
 Thanks for having me . I 'm excited to be here .
 So , Wil , what do you have for us first ?
 Well , this is an exciting one .
 This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets .
 Now what 's interesting about this flag ... Cut .

 What was wrong with that ?
 It 's called " Fun with Flags . " They 're not at half- mast , nobody died .
 Let 's try and keep it upbeat .
 Um , no offense , but I 've been acting since I was a kid .
 I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction . SHELDON : It 's true .
 In 1982 , Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in
 You moved me .
 You 'll have to forgive me .
 This is my first time directing , I just want it to be good . So do I.
 Great .
 So , this time let 's try more real boy , less Pinocchio .
 And action . And cut .
 You realize that I 'm doing this for free , right ?
 Yes .
 And so far , we 're still not getting our money 's worth .
 Let 's try it again .
 Everybody 's having fun .
 And action . So , Wil ...

 ... what do you have for us first ?
 Well , this is an one .
 This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets . Cut .
 Problem , first- time director ?
 SHELDON :
 Oh , none that I could see .
 I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do .
 I got goose bumps .
 He was overacting on purpose . Really ?
 He reminded me of a young William Shatner .
 Listen , Sheldon , I 'm really happy to do this for you , but not if she 's gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time .
 You gonna let him speak to me like that ?
 Well ... you 're my girlfriend and I don 't want you to be upset .
 Then again , Wil Wheaton 's my friend and I don 't want him to be upset . Hmm ...
 This is a sticky wicket .
 What do you think ?
 Can I speak to you for a second ?
 I 'll be right back .
 Feel free to play with yourself .
 I don 't care for your friend , he 's being rude to me . You need to ask him to leave .
 Amy , I can 't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave .
 He 's a minor celebrity .
 Once you explain who he is , many people recognize him .
 Fine .
 Then maybe I should go . Could you ?
 That would solve everything .
 You are the I 'll see you at dinner tonight ?
 You sure you wouldn 't rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton ?
 Come to think of it , I would !

 Original Air Date on November 8 , 2012 Every time we eat dinner here , your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes .

 Don 't take it personally .
 She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking .
 You ready to go ? Yeah , let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks .
 I don 't understand why you keep your stuff here when there 's plenty of room at home .
 What are you talking about ?
 All I have here is a few sweaters , books , bank stuff , computers , mail , collectibles , medicine and my electric body groomer .
 Ooh , there 's my plaid dickie .
 Oh , got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents .
 Can you believe it ?
 50 cents sounds right .
 Let 's go . You know , it 's kinda late .
 Why don 't we just spend the night here ?
 Because we don 't live here .
 I know . Do you ?
 You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment , but half the time we stay here .
 That 's not true .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Howard , I 'm doing laundry !
 You want me to put anything in for you ? !
 There 's some underwear in the hamper ! Oh , good !
 I got that new stain stick to try out !

 Thank you !
 I only put it on the list two weeks ago !
 Okay , I see what you 're getting at . How about this weekend I 'll box up all my things and move them to our place .

 Thank you .
 The lightsabers are gonna look great in the living room .
 Or in the closet .
 We can decide later .
 Howard , help !
 My hand 's stuck in the garbage disposal !
 Let go of whatever piece of food you 're holding ! MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Are you kidding ? !
 It 's a perfectly good chicken leg !

 Hey , look who 's out after dark , like a big boy .
 I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton .
 Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet .
 I thought you had plans with Amy .
 Yeah , I did , but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A- S- S.
 She got huffy and left , then Wil and I headed out to dinner .
 That place really did remind me of my hometown . Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet .
 Hold on .
 Wil and Amy had an argument ?
 Yes , quite the kerfuffle .
 Then Amy got mad and left ?
 Walked right out the door .
 And you ... ?
 Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price . The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yogurt machine .

 Right next to it !
 I was closer to it than I am to you right now . Buddy , I think Amy might be upset .

 Why 's that ? Because your friend was rude to her , and then you went to dinner with him .

 You 're just repeating what I said .
 It 's like living with a lactose- intolerant parrot .
 Trust me , call her .
 Fine .
 It 's a shame you didn 't go to dinner with us , because the buffet you 're about to enjoy only serves humble pie , a dessert much less tasty than frozen yogurt .
 I was this close .
 ( Skype ringing )
 What ?
 You 'll appreciate this .
 Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you 're mad at me .
 Tell him you 're not mad at me .
 Go ahead , set him straight .
 I 'm mad at you , Sheldon . Hmm .
 Eat one of your Luna bars .
 Very often when women think they 're angry , they 're really just hungry .
 I 'm not hungry .
 Your friend insulted me , and you didn 't do anything .
 Precisely , I didn 't do anything .
 Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math ?
 Keep going , buddy , you 're doing great .
 Sheldon , I 'm your girlfriend , and you should have taken my side . That 's it .
 End of story .
 Good night . Wow , Amy 's mad and Leonard was right .
 What a weird day .
 Hey .
 Sorry this took so long .
 But you used to work here , you know how it is .
 Kitchen slammed again ?
 No , I 'm a terrible waitress , remember ?
 So , is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow ? Now that you mention it ,
 I was thinking tomorrow might not be great .
 What 's your excuse this time ?
 No excuse .
 It 's just , you know , I 'm Jewish , and technically , we 're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath .
 So this one 's on God .
 That might be a little more convincing if you didn 't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger .
 My religion 's kinda loosey- goosey .
 Basically , as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don 't wear a cross , you 're good .

 Howie , you promised you 'd move .
 And I will . Yeah , right . I 'm obviously not going to live in my mother 's house for the rest of my life .
 I will .
 I 'm not a child .
 I 've seen her burp you . She did not burp me .
 She was patting me on the back , and I happened to burp .
 Don 't you have other tables you should be waiting on ?
 Yeah , but I told you , I 'm not good at my job .
 Bernadette , listen to me . He is never gonna leave .
 I 'm starting to think you 're right .
 All right , I 've had enough of this .
 I 'm a grown man , I have a successful career .
 For the love of God , I 've been to space !
 I will move out when I 'm ready , and I don 't need anyone badgering me into it !
 Wow , excuse me . That was just for her benefit .
 I 'll move tomorrow .
 I love you .
 Don 't leave me .
 Amy .
 Amy .
 Angry Amy .
 What ? I 've been thinking about what happened , and I hope this gift will make things better .
 DVDs ?
 Why would I want this ?
 First of all , you 're welcome .
 Furthermore , not being familiar with Wil Wheaton 's body of work , there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure .
 Get ready for 130 hours of " I told you so . "
 Fine .
 I 'll just tell you what happens .
 Episode one , " Encounter at Farpoint . "
 Fade in . The new heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV .
 Enter Wesley Crusher , played by my buddy ...

 She 's hooked .

 Wow .
 An end of an era .
 ( sighs )
 Boy , if these walls could talk .
 They 'd say , " Why does he touch himself so much ? "

 Yeah .
 I can 't believe I 'm not going to live here anymore .
 This has always been my bedroom .
 Right here is where my mom used to mark my height .
 Oh , yeah .
 Fifth grade .
 Sixth grade .
 Seventh grade . Eighth grade . Ninth grade .
 I remember when I was five , hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy .
 Had some Peanut M& M 'S , went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital .
 Came home , celebrated with a Snickers , went into my second anaphylactic shock .
 When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts ?
 Sometime around the third Almond Joy . Okay .
 You want to start loading this stuff into the truck ?
 Yeah , I guess . Hey , would you do me a favor ? Go on ahead .
 I just want one last moment alone in my old room .
 We 're not standing outside by the U- Haul while you fondle yourself .
 ( scoffs )
 Fine , let 's go .

 Hey . What brings you in ?
 Penny , if you wouldn 't mind , I 'd like to have a conversation about girls .
 I had a feeling we 'd have a talk like this sooner or later .
 Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places ?
 Penny , please ,
 I 'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma .
 And for the record , I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19 .
 And for the record ... ( vomiting noises )
 So what are you drinking ?
 Well , it 's been a rough day .
 I usually go chamomile tea , but I don 't think that 's going to cut it .
 You could have a Long Island Iced Tea .
 Will that calm my nerves ?
 It 's calmed the pants off me a couple of times . Sold .
 Oh .
 So , the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble ? The trouble isn 't with me , Penny , it 's with your gender .
 Someday , scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle .
 Yeah , Amy told me what happened .
 Look , just apologize .
 It 'll warm her twaddle . ( groans )
 It 's a Band- Aid at best . The core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other .
 Which is baffling because they 're both crazy about me .
 And I like them , which indicates they 're bright and interesting and/ or were on
 Honey , you can 't make people like each other .
 Not true .
 Leonard made me like you .
 And let me tell you , that was a hard row to hoe .
 Cheers , pal .
 Ooh . Boy , that is a treat that 's hard to beat .

 Get the Mad Hatter on the horn , I 'm having a tea party .


 You might want to pace yourself .
 I drink tea all the time .
 I think I know what I 'm doing .
 Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis .
 Look , Sheldon , your problem is not Wil Wheaton , okay ?
 Your problem is the way you treated Amy . ( slurps ) My problem is I 'm out of tea .
 Come on , someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it .
 I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk .
 Penny , please ,
 I think I 've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing .
 Sorry .
 On the other hand , that low- down polecat done wronged my woman .
 Welcome to Long Island , Tex .

 Amy deserves better .
 You know , when we buy the Planter 's deluxe mix , she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don 't have to look at them .
 She 's a unique blend of saint and squirrel .
 Yeah , that she is .
 Here you go . I 'm a callous egomaniac .
 She 's gonna leave me .
 No , she won 't .
 No , she won 't .
 I 'm great .
 ( exhales )
 Okay , I have now officially moved out of my mother 's house .
 You are now the only woman in my life who I 'll see naked in the bathroom .
 I know this wasn 't easy .
 You doing okay ?
 Oh , I 'm fine .
 It 's just her I 'm worried about .
 Aw , she 'll be okay . She 's a grown woman . I know .
 It 's just ever since my dad left ,
 I 've felt responsible for her .
 That 's a lot for a kid to deal with . She was just so sad all the time .
 Yeah , I was the only person who could cheer her up .
 Well , me and Ben and Jerry .
 She 's lucky you were there .
 You know , she 's why I first got into magic .
 I would do little shows for her , hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain , put on a top hat and cape .
 And part way through the act ,
 I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage .
 I can still remember the way she 'd smile .
 For a few minutes , she 'd ... forget how lonely she was .
 ( sighs ) Aw , crap .
 Let 's go .
 Where we going ?
 Grab a box . We 'll sleep at your mother 's place tonight .
 No , but I want to live here .
 Well , you should 've thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story .
 Can 't we talk about this ?
 No husband of mine is gonna break his mother 's heart !


 Wil Wheaton !
 Wil Wheaton ! Wait , how many was that ?

 Hey , Sheldon , what 's up ?
 Wouldn 't you like to know ? Have you been drinking ?
 Just tea .
 The best tea I 've ever had .
 Why are you here ?
 I 'll tell you .
 I 'm from Texas .
 Need I say more ?
 Yeah , actually , a little more would be helpful .
 You insulted my woman .
 I 'm here to defend her honor .
 Two !
 It was two .
 Wil Wheaton !
 Now prepare yourself for what may come .
 Oh , Sheldon , do you really think we 're gonna fight ?
 My fists are not up here because I 'm milking a giant invisible cow .
 They 're up to beat an apology out of you .
 Okay , I 'm sorry .
 Well , that was a long bus ride for not very much .
 Are you okay ?
 You 're asking a lot of questions , Wil Wheaton .
 As a matter of idle curiosity , which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting ?
 Never mind , I 'll choose .
 ( vomiting )
 You were so good in
 ( vomiting )
