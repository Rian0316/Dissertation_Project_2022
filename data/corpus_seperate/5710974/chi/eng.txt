 00 : 00 : 35, 200 -- > 00 : 00 : 36, 720 - Captain Daly .
 - Report .
 A non- federation vessel jumped straight out of white space right in front of us .

 - Valdack . - That can 't be .
 My data scan indicates a heavily armored Gorgan Dreadnought , vessel ID number 9864321 .
 Thank you , Dudani .
 Valdack must have hijacked it from the Fermi hub and tracked our position .

 - Tulaska , shield status ?
 - Shields 100 % . - Helmsman Packer ? - Captain .
 - Prime rear thrusters . - Rear thrusters primed .
 If that 's Valdack , he 'll rip us to shreds .
 Captain , we have to surrender .
 There 's no other way .
 Let 's not lose our heads , Lieutenant Walton .

 Shields at 68 % .
 Heavy damage reported , decks six through ten .
 Fires in med center and major rupture to cargo bay Alpha .
 We 've got no choice !
 Do you want me to open comms with Valdack 's craft , Captain ? Negative .
 - Shields at 54 % .
 - There 's no way out . - Captain , please . - Not now , Walton .
 Helmsman Packer , take us into that asteroid gas cluster .
 - Into the cluster ? - That 's suicide , sir .
 It is our only chance . That gas cluster is charged with ionized pyron particles .
 If our shields hold , we can use them to increase our photon intensity .
 Packer , increase thrusters .

 Shields at 43 % .
 It 'll tear the ship apart , Captain !
 Walton , you are a Space Fleet officer . Act accordingly .
 - Shields at 32 % .
 - Valdack 's not following .
 Packer , turn us around .
 - Tulaska , charge photon bolts .
 - Bolts charged , Captain .

 Fire !
 His hull 's breached , shields gone .
 He 's defenseless .
 - Lieutenant Lowry , open comms . - He 's already hailing us , Captain . On screen .
 Captain Daly , may you drown in the venom of 900 Tragorian snakes !
 You are defeated , Valdack .
 Return the plasmorthian crystal and we 'll cause you no more damage . You must think me a fool , Captain !
 I know the crystal 's capabilities , and I will die before I give it up !
 I gave you a chance , Valdack , showed you mercy .
 Reflect on that while you can . Close comms .
 - Tulaska , destroy his ship .
 - Yes , Captain .

 - That was incredible , Captain .
 - You saved our lives .
 I 'm so sorry I lost it back there , Captain .
 Not for the first time , Walton .
 And I should know by now never to doubt you .
 Please forgive me .
 At ease , Walton .
 Captain , sensors indicate an escape pod ejected from Valdack 's ship before detonation .
 He 's escaping with the crystal .
 You want me to plot a pursuit course , Captain ? No .
 We 'll let him go ... for now .
 - Great decision- making , Captain .
 - Three cheers for Captain Daly .
 - Hip hip . - Hooray !
 - Hip hip . - Hooray ! - Hip hip .
 - Hooray ! ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪
 God bless you , Captain .
 God bless you .

 Thirteenth floor .
 - Welcome to Callister .
 - Oh .
 Excuse me .
 Excuse me .


 Hey .



 Uh ...
 Elena , my pass doesn 't work . You must renew on first of each month .
 Yeah , I know that , but the first was on the weekend , so ...
 OK .

 Thank you . You 're welcome .
 Prepare to enter the most immersive gaming experience in years ,
 Infinity , from Callister Inc .
 - Morning , Mr. Daly . - Helmsman Packer .
 Huh ?
 Uh , I mean , Mr. Packer .
 Nate .
 OK .
 Are you making coffees ? Yeah .
 Do you think maybe you could make me one too ?
 Sure , sure .
 Uh , what do you want ?
 Just vanilla latte .
 Skim milk .
 Yeah , good call . 'Cause ...
 ... those are very , very big numbers .
 We might just have to hold you to that .
 Well , no , yes , of course .
 Sure .
 Yes .
 Oh , are you OK , man ?
 I guess you didn 't see my gym bag .
 Here .
 Come on .
 - I 'm sorry , bud .
 - OK .
 You left it ...
 You 're gonna do it for me and make it good .
 You know you are a god to me at least .

 Oh .
 The ladies ' bathroom is that way . The sign 's kind of confusing .
 You 're Robert Daly , right ?
 - Right .
 - Yeah , hi .
 I 'm Nanette , Nanette Cole .
 Um ...
 I started here today , coding on the update , and I just wanted to , uh , pass on my admiration to the person who actually designed Infinity .
 The procedural algorithm is amazing .
 It 's just some beautiful code . Thank you .
 That 's actually the reason that I wanted to work here .

 - You must be busy . I 'm so sorry . - No , no , it 's fine .
 - Sorry .
 - No .
 Well , just fangirling .
 Sorry .
 Um ...

 Ooh ... vintage .
 - Yeah , it 's Space Fleet .
 - Wow . It 's a TV show .
 Before your time . Before my time , actually .
 But it was ... visionary .
 Is this on , like , tape ? Yeah , I 've got the VHS , the DVD , Blu- ray .
 The whole thing .
 Seasons one to six . Netflix has it these days , but ...
 Aboard the spaceship USS Callister .
 - OK , yeah . - Mm- hmm .
 So -- OK , so Callister is like the , uh -- Yeah , when we set up the company , um ...
 I suggested we call it Callister as kind of a little tribute .
 Walton didn 't really get the reference , but he let me have that one .

 Mini- skirted damsels .
 A little cold for that in space .
 That is just what a Bargradian sand warrior would say .
 Bob , Christmas is closing in like a goddamn meteor .
 We 've got customers all over our balls waiting for the Infinity update . Tell me it 's gonna be up and running before the weekend .
 - Oh , I 'll ask Kabir -- - You 're CTO .
 Don 't ask anybody anything .
 You should be telling people things like I 'm telling you right now .
 - I 'll talk to him . - Good . - I 'm sorry .
 - OK .
 - Hello . - Hello .
 Sorry , I couldn 't find a good moment to ... Oh , you must be new .
 Uh ... I 'm James Walton . I run the company .
 - I -- - Well , we run the company , kind of .
 Bob here is the hardware , and I am the shiny front end .
 - I 'm Nanette Cole .
 - Which department ? - Engine architecture . - And it 's your first day ?
 Uh ...
 - Yeah . - Have you had the tour ?
 No , I ...
 Please , allow me .
 OK .
 It was so nice to meet you . Just a little bit .
 It 's a different environment I set up here .
 People call it a carefree environment .
 I call it " care- full . "
 - Interesting .
 - Not scary .


 Dudani ?

 Kabir ? Mm .
 Mr. Daly .
 Do you have the latest ETA on the update patch ?
 It 's just there 's still some runtime errors .
 Well , the thing is , we could have it ready by end of play today , but if we had time , we could alter the trading mechanics , tweak the critical hit system , but of course , that 'd add another week , maybe ten days or so .
 Mr. Daly ?
 - Yeah .
 Yeah , do all of that , thank you .
 - I 'll ...
 OK , we 're on it .









 Welcome back , Captain .
 Have you located Valdack 's position ?
 Not yet , but our sensors are scanning every star system between here and Valatros .
 So your answer is no ?

 Uh ...
 I 'm afraid so , sir .

 You ... are pathetic , Walton . What are you ?
 What 's that ?
 Pathetic .

 So Valdack 's out there somewhere and you village idiots are asleep at the wheel .
 You 're not just disgraceful , you 're disgusting , all of you .
 So can you do one thing ?
 Can you find Valdack ? I 'm not asking .

 I 'm telling you !
 Understand ? - Hmm ?
 - Yes .
 - Yes ?
 - Yes , Captain .
 Yeah .
 - Yes .
 - Aye , Captain .
 Huh ?
 Well , all right .
 Tulaska , check security protocols .
 If they 've expired , you 're in trouble .
 Yes , Captain .
 Dudani , recheck those probe results .
 - No room for errors . - Of course , Captain .
 - Helmsman Packer ? - Captain .
 Vanilla latte .
 - Skim milk . - At once .
 Walton .

 Exit game .

 Hi , Nanette . You feel like you have everything you need here ?
 Mm- hmm .
 - All right .
 That 's a nice sweater .
 - Oh .
 Thank you .
 Cashmere ?
 Mr. Daly , got that new ETA on the update patch .
 - New ETA ?
 - Yeah , it 's all good . But now we 're looking at December 24th for rollout .
 We don 't patch until Christmas Eve ?
 Well , yeah , I mean , with the alterations you approved .


 OK , OK .
 Thank you .
 OK .

 - Hi , Robert .
 - Hi . Um , I was just gonna fix a coffee .
 Do you want one ?
 - Sure . - OK .
 Um ... vanilla latte with skim milk .
 - Okey- dokes . - OK .
 Absolutely .

 Mm- hmm . Well , yes , they are great numbers .
 OK . Mm- hmm .
 Ta- ta . Total fucking shitwit .
 - Do you want coffee ?
 - Um , Brushed Suede . Thank you . So how are you settling in ?
 Are you settling in ?
 Uh , yeah , yeah . Everyone here is really friendly .
 And um ... it is not like my last job , thank God .
 - Yeah ? - It was a toxic workplace , you know .
 My boss was a major- league bully and ...
 - It 's not like here , like with Mr ...
 - Walton . - Yeah . - Oh , yeah .
 He 's a really good guy . He 's a bit of a player .
 Chuck a sandwich across the room , he 'll fuck it before it hits the ground , but he 's basically an all right bloke .
 OK .
 Well , there 's uh ... two bosses here anyway , so I guess --
 - Two how ?
 - Robert Daly .
 Oh !
 I mean , well , yeah , technically .
 Mr. Daly is actually the whole reason that I 'm here . - Really ? Interesting .
 - I mean ... Who wouldn 't wanna work under an incredible mind like that , you know ?
 His coding is ...
 It 's sublime . Do you have a thing for him ?
 Daly ? No , no .
 No . It 's not like that .
 It 's purely ... It 's professional .
 I like his code . Ah .
 Fucking hell , I was gonna say , you know , don 't be too nice to him ' cause he gets a bit starey . Mm .
 Wide berth , that 's my advice .
 Wide berth .
 - OK .
 - Yeah .
 Thank you .

 - There you go .
 - Thank you .



 - Bye . - No bye .
 I 'm coming .
 No .
 Suck a dick , Karl .
 Later , guys .




 Welcome to Callister .
 Thank you .
 You 're welcome .



 Goddamn it , Robert !
 - Christmas Eve . Really ? - Uh ...
 Not OK .

 Oh .

 Hello ?


 Oh , boy .
 It looks like there 's a new girl in the office .
 What 's your name , hon ?

 Come in . Let me fix you a drink .
 We have everything from Bengarian phlegm shots to uh ... ooh , distilled root blood from the Cangor quadrant .
 What 's your poison ?
 Some of this actually is poison , so don 't be shy . Am I dreaming ?

 Yeah , no , no , 'fraid not .
 - I remember dreaming . - Me too .
 But where am I ?
 This is the USS Callister , Space Fleet 's finest , exploring the furthest reaches of the known universe and beyond .
 We are its loyal space crew and now , apparently , so are you .
 Cheers . Your name ?
 Babe , what 's your name ? Nanette .
 We 've met . Maybe , in the real world . I wouldn 't have no way of knowing .
 - What do you mean ?
 - You 'd better sit down .
 No , I don 't ...
 I don 't wanna sit down .
 I wanna know what 's going on .
 You 're on board Robert Daly 's ship .
 Robert Daly , the CTO ?
 Here he 's Captain Daly , our fearless leader .
 Yeah , you 're seriously gonna need to sit the fuck down .
 - Uh ... - Welcome .
 You are um ... Hey , hey .
 You 're the intern from work , right ? Nate ? Packer .
 Nate Packer . Wait .
 So I 'm still just the intern out there ?
 Jesus .
 You 're um ... You 're ... You 're ...
 Dudani .
 Diagnostics .
 - Welcome . - Right .

 - You 're the receptionist , right ?
 - Elena . - Your skin is blue . - Weird blue alien skin , I know .
 It 's fucked up .
 Almost sort of racist . OK .
 Walt , fix her something , something she 'll recognize .
 Vodka . - Hey . So what 's it like out there now ?
 - What ?
 - What year is it ?
 - Don 't do her head in . - What ?
 - What year ?
 I ... saw you today .
 Ooh .
 Did you see me ? Did I look thin ?
 Hmm ? Like , wheatgrass yogurt thin ?
 Can we not pop her fucking mind ? Someone needs to be straight with me right now .
 OK .
 OK , listen . This is Infinity .
 That 's what we 're all inside .
 That 's where all of this exists .
 Infinity , the game ?
 Daly 's got his own modded version of Infinity , reskinned to look like his favorite TV show .
 - Space Thing ?
 Space Thing ?
 - Space Fleet .
 - Hence the groovy decor . - And this tasteful get- up .
 Infinity . That 's an online game , like a multiplayer deal . This ...
 This is his development build , sealed off so he can control it .
 He keeps it offline so the custom code he 's written can 't be detected and deleted .
 Mm .
 Yes , it 's a bubble universe , ruled by an asshole god .
 He ... put us in ... in here ?
 Mm- hmm .
 Drink your vodka .
 - How do we get out ?
 - No , really , drink it .
 Drink it .

 - You can 't leave . - What ?
 None of us can . - Because you 're not actually you .
 - What ?
 I know it 's mental , but you 're a copy of you .
 - A digital clone .
 - No . No , I am ... I 'm me .
 I am me .
 - I 'm me .
 - No , not the real you .
 Daly 's created an identical digital version of you , of all of us .
 From your DNA . He 'll have harvested it somehow .
 He told me he got mine from the rim of a smoothie cup .
 He retrieved Packer 's juices from the bathroom .
 Man , you have got to let that go . She does not need details .
 Basically he 's got a gizmo -- I theorize an advanced biometric DNA virtual clone .
 He 's got a fucking gizmo . That 's what I said .
 He fed your DNA in , he put you inside his computer and , bam , you pop up here like a Pop- Tart .
 Yeah , we 've all been through it .
 He brings us in for different reasons , shit we did in the office .
 I called him out for staring .
 I reset admin permissions on a test build for 14 minutes .
 Insufficient smiling .
 - I brought him the wrong sandwich . - OK , never mind the reasons .
 The point is that we 're stuck in Daly 's playground , and that 's all you need to know .
 This is a dream . Yeah , it has to be .
 It 's more like an eternal waking nightmare from which there is no escape .

 - No , no . No , no , no . No , no , no .
 - Oh , for fuck 's sake ,
 I 'm trying to break her in gently .
 The quicker she gets it , the easier it 'll be .
 Daddy 's home .
 He 'll be here any moment .
 No . I 'm gonna get out of here .
 Whoa , whoa , whoa ! You gotta stay on the bridge . He controls everything .
 - He does shit to make us cooperate . - Get off .
 - You have no idea . I 'm trying to help . - Just leave it .
 He 's gonna fuck us up if she doesn 't play ball .
 Yes , well , she 's gonna have to work it out for herself , like we all did .

 There 's gotta be a way out .
 Come on .

 Lieutenant Cole , welcome aboard .
 Crew , we have a new member of the team , Science Officer Nanette Cole .
 Please , take your post .
 I believe we 've finally managed to track Valdack to an uncharted planet .
 - No .
 - Take your post .
 That is an order . I 'm not doing this .
 The whole thing 's much better if you let yourself get into it .
 If you think that I 'm playing along with your Space Force bullshit ...
 - Space Fleet . - Whatever . - You can think again .
 - This is my ship .
 - I am your captain .
 An order is an order . - Then go fuck yourself . Sir .
 OK .
 So we 're doing it this way .
 Are you gonna throw a fireball ?
 Oh , dear .
 You can 't see .
 You can 't breathe . Unpleasant , isn 't it ?

 Do you submit ? You won 't die , you know .
 No one dies in here unless I want them to .
 I can keep you like this forever if I feel like it .
 Forever gasping for breath with a mouth that isn 't there .
 Do you submit ?
 Good girl .

 Lieutenant Cole , Valdack 's hideout .
 Triangulate the signal , please .

 It 's any button . They 're all the same .

 Well ? I 'm getting a signal from a class five planet .


 - Rannotch .
 - Rannoch . Rannoch B.
 Excellent .
 Dudani , prepare the transmat system .
 - Of course , Captain . - Walton , Packer , Lowry , with me .
 We 'll transport down to the planet , reclaim the crystal and bring Valdack to justice .

 Actually , Cole , you come too .
 Perfect opportunity for you to prove you 're more than a recommendation from Space Fleet .
 What do you say ?

 - Mr. Dudani , transport .
 - Aye aye , Captain .


 Breathable atmosphere .
 Scanning for plasmorthian traces .

 Crystal 's this way . Let 's go . - Nate .
 Hey , Nate . - Helmsman Packer , OK ?
 Call me Helmsman Packer . He hates it when we don 't use our proper titles .
 OK . You got a gun , so let 's take him out . - Then give it to me .
 - OK , one , our guns don 't even work .
 Only his does .
 And two , the motherfucker is invincible , OK ?
 Come on , let 's go .
 At least you 've got a gun .

 - Captain .
 - Shh .
 We meet again , Captain Daly !

 We 're trapped .
 Not advisable .
 My plasma grenade will turn you into screaming soup .
 He 's not going to kill us , Captain . He had the element of surprise .
 He 'd have done it when he had the chance . Haven 't worked out how to use the crystal , have you , Valdack ?
 It 's true , I require your Space Fleet knowledge .
 But it 's also true that you 're gonna give it to me !
 Don 't be so sure . - Jesus .
 I ... - Shh .
 Let 's see how your resolve holds up once you 're devoured one by one by my Arachnajax !
 - Holy shit .
 Oh , my God .
 - We 're all gonna die .

 Killing us won 't make us tell you how the crystal works , Valdack .
 We will never ...
 Hold on . I think my pizza 's here .
 Pause game .
 What 's happening ?
 You heard him .
 He paused the game .
 ' Cause he 's got a pizza delivery ... out there .

 Hold on .

 Watch out .
 He 'll be back soon .
 Ah . That 's good .
 This launcher 's heavy as shit .
 How you holding up ?
 You know , we 're existing .
 How you doing , Gillian ?

 Well , yeah .

 - Well , you look great . - Her name 's Gillian .
 - Did you lose weight ? - She was in marketing .
 Yeah , Daly turned her into ... that because she wouldn 't play along when he cloned her into here .
 This universe is littered with things like her , poor fuckers who stepped out of line .
 - Thank you .
 - Thanks .


 - Here comes Captain Dick .
 - Hey . Hey .
 Hey .
 I 'm gonna get you .
 I 'm gonna get you .
 Hey . Hey .

 If we die , the secret of the crystal dies with us , Valdack .
 Oh , my God . We are all gonna die ! - Valdack ?
 - What is it , Captain ? Final words ?

 Over there .
 A naked lady .
 Really ?


 Great plan , Captain .
 Unparalleled tactics , Captain .

 We 've fought many battles , haven 't we , Captain ? We have .
 And I 've been a good adversary for you , have I not ?
 Then please ...

 ... end it .
 Please .


 Killing in cold blood is against Space Fleet code .
 I wish I could help .

 Sorry , bud .

 Take him to the brig .
 - Dudani .
 - Captain .
 - Transport us aboard .
 - Yes , Captain . No more .
 It 's OK .
 - Hip hip .
 - Hooray ! - Hip hip . - Hooray !
 ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow For he 's a jolly fellow ♪ ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ And so say ... ♪ Oh , my fuck .
 That wasn 't very nice .


 Today I will show you mercy . - Great mercy- showing , Captain .
 - Shh ! Tomorrow you should reconsider your ... amenability .
 I may not be feeling so benevolent .

 Exit game . - Oh .
 Fucking hell . - This was tense .
 I don 't like tense .
 - Drink ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 So how was the mission ?
 Wasn 't too bad . Usual standoff storyline . - Ooh .
 Saw Gillian from marketing . Yeah . - Oh .
 There is no way that I am kissing that asshole .
 Then he 's just gonna get more and more pissed .
 - How about you kiss him , then ?
 - You get used to it . It 's -- There 's no tongues .
 If that 's any consolation , there 's never any tongues .
 - Doing tongues is not Space Fleet way . - Mm .
 It 's not like it can go beyond kissing anyway .
 What do you mean ? Oh .
 You haven 't noticed ?
 What are you doing ?
 Please .
 Please , don 't do that . Don 't ... Oh , my God .
 - Oh . Oh . Oh .
 - Yes .
 There 's no genitals in Space Fleet . This is a wholesome universe .
 He must have modified our code that way . Mm . We 're all the same .
 If you don 't believe me , take a look down there . We have tried grinding our mounds together out of sheer boredom .
 - No sensation at all .
 - Can 't even shit .
 Can 't even have the basic fucking pleasure of pushing out a shit .
 I miss taking shit . OK .
 Stealing my pussy is a red fucking line .
 - We are gonna get this bastard !
 - No . - Yeah . - We 've tried a million times .
 No way out .
 Walton .
 Come on , Walton . Like I said , he 's an asshole god .
 Mnh- mnh . Daly 's smart , but he 's not a god .

 He 's a coder .
 He is fallible .

 Kabir , what was that thing he was holding in his hand , that scanner thing ?
 His omnicorder , primary communications device . You said he kept his version of the game offline .
 But the omnicorder made contact with the outside world when the pizza came , so it 's gotta be connected to his home system at least .
 The omnicorder 's gone .
 It loads when he loads , and it goes when he goes , and that 's the only one .
 No .
 There has got to be a way to connect .
 You won 't hack it .
 I 've tried .
 I haven 't .


 Bingo .

 - Oh , that 's good .
 - Yeah . - This is part of Infinity 's front end . - Yeah .
 You can invite a friend with a custom message .
 - A message to outside ?
 - Just one .
 140 characters maximum .
 So who are you gonna contact ?


 Thirteenth floor .
 Welcome to Callister .
 - Hey , Elena .
 - Hi .








 - You need me buzz you in ?
 - What ?
 Uh , no , no , I --
 - I got that for you .
 - Oh .
 Thank you .
 After you .


 Um ... Mr. Daly , hi .
 Hi .
 Can I talk to you for a second ?
 Did you just send me an Infinity invite ?
 Wha ... No . It was really weird .
 It had a message attached . Something about people trapped in a game .
 Probably just a spambot .
 Firewall doesn 't always get them all . - Yeah .
 - I wouldn 't -- I wouldn 't worry about it .
 You didn 't open the link , did you ?
 Oh , God , no .
 - Maybe upgrade your security software .
 - All right .
 Have a good one .


 That 's the thing there .
 Oh , yeah .
 Could you please , please cut that shit out ?
 I 'm trying to make it like a hobby .
 Oh , that 's good .
 That is way too early .
 He 's only been at work a few hours .
 She got the message !
 I did . It 's me .
 That 's me or the cops most likely .
 Oh .
 We are getting out of here !

 What is Space Fleet ?
 I 'll tell you what it is .
 It is a belief system ... founded on the very best of human nature .
 It is a goal for us to strive towards for the betterment of the universe , for the betterment of life itself .
 And you assholes are fucking it up !
 I did it .
 I did .
 I did it . I sent the message .
 It was me .
 No one else was involved , I swear .
 I tried the carrot .
 Now meet the stick .
 No , this is gonna make you happy , Daly , 'cause you 're sick .
 And you need help .
 No , don 't , don 't !
 Captain . Captain , please .
 OK , look , she 's new .
 She 'll behave . We 'll all behave .
 Just let her off .
 Let her off this once .

 Please .

 OK .
 OK . OK .
 No !
 Daly , no !
 No , no , no , no !


 You know what makes me happy ? The look on your face right now .
 Dudani , Walton , Tulaska , take this thing to the brig with Valdack .
 Packer , find a barren planet we can dump her on .
 And you ... can just stay here and think about your attitude .
 Exit game .


 Update patch .

 The update patch .
 It 's there , there . - So what ?
 It 's a wormhole . - Unh- unh .
 That is the Christmas update patch preinstalling itself .
 The wormhole ... it 's just how the game is expressing the uplink .
 So ?
 Daly 's custom build is still connected to the internet .
 Some way .
 If this is another one of your plans , just stop before somebody else gets monsterfied .
 No , no , this ... this can work . We can 't get all- in access from the ship .
 He 'll have crippled permissions . Yes , but what if we fly into the wormhole ?
 - Like , on purpose ?
 - We 'd hit the system firewall .
 - Exactly . Yeah . - And have our rogue coding deleted .
 - Deleted as in ... ? - As in die . Whether it 's dying would depend on your position regarding sentient code --
 We would cease to exist , that 's true .
 But we 'd be free .
 We 'd be ... free .

 This is academic since we have no means of getting to the wormhole .
 There 's no way to pilot the damn thing without Daly here and he can stop us like that .
 What about if he 's logged in but on pause ?
 Like when his pizza came , he was just frozen there .
 Flying would be possible , but that wormhole 's a whole parsec away .
 We 'd never reach it before he got back . Unless we stalled him for longer .
 And that we do how ?
 If we can get Daly 's omnicorder , we can make a phone call , right ?
 Theoretically , yes , but --
 If we can get real me on the phone again , I , um ... I may have some leverage .
 - Leverage ? On yourself ?
 - Mm- hmm . - Like what ?
 - My PhotoCloud account .
 I know the password , obviously .
 There are some pretty ... interesting images on there that I should have deleted a while ago , but I didn 't .
 So , we can blackmail me .
 I 'm pretty sure that I 'd do anything to keep those photos from getting out . Must be pretty pictures .
 Look , if this is going to work , we all have to be in on it .
 OK ?
 Flying into certain death in a wormhole beats another 10, 000 years with Captain Ass .
 - I 'm in .
 - OK . Me too .
 Also me .
 Well , I am out .
 Daly won .
 Daly 's always won .
 We just have to get on with it ... ' cause we don 't have a chance . - Yes , we do .
 - Hmm ?
 We fly into the wormhole and we are extinct .
 We are gone .
 We are rid of his shit . Sounds peachy . What is with you ?

 Don 't you wanna fight back ?
 Why won 't you fight back ?
 Tommy . - Who is Tommy ? - He 's my son .
 He 's six years old , at least he was when I woke up in here .
 See , in the early days of this ship , it was just me and Daly .

 I was his pet project .
 He tried everything to break me , and I withstood it all ' cause I just thought there was still a chance I could get out and see my boy again .
 In a way , I was right , I did get to see him again .
 Just not the real him .
 Daly told me what happened .
 Back on the outside , the real me , uh ... brought Tommy to work one day , showed him around .
 He would 've loved seeing all those computers . He 's really into that stuff .
 Anyway , evidently ...
 Tommy had a lollipop that day .
 That 's all Daly needed .


 He copied him in here .
 It was Tommy all right .
 He was alike in every way .
 Dad !
 Daddy ...
 You know what he did to him ?

 Tommy !
 He took Tommy and he threw him out of the airlock . - Tommy ! - Daddy !
 - Right out into space .
 - Daddy ! No ! And he made me watch .
 Tommy !
 Have you ever seen an unsuited body compress in space ?
 They freeze ... and crack like a porcelain doll .

 I take my hat off to Daly .
 The detail in this place is exceptional .
 And he said he 'd do it again and again ,
 ' cause Daly 's still got Tommy 's DNA .
 He 's got all of our DNA . He keeps it in his bedroom in a fucking mini fridge by his desk .
 So I have to stay in line , because even if we die in here , he can bring us back .
 He can bring Tommy back whenever he wants .
 And God knows how he 'd take it out on him .
 God knows what he 'd do .
 So , you see , what choice do I have ?

 Walton .
 We are gonna get that fucking lollipop .
 But you gotta believe me .
 Can you do that ?
 Can you ?



 Good to see you at your position , Cole .

 Captain , you 've come at just the right time .
 I have ?
 I 'm picking up a distress signal from the surface of Skillane IV .
 Looks like a crashed shuttle .
 What should we do ?

 Space Fleet never turns its back on those who need our help .
 - Dudani , set a course for Skillane IV . - Aye aye , sir . We 'll send a search party .
 Packer , Tulaska -- Actually , Captain , I was thinking maybe you could take me alone .
 As science officer , I need to learn the ropes , and I could use your close attention .

 Good .
 Yes , good idea .


 Atmosphere 's good .
 Over there .

 From here , the shuttle appears to be deserted .
 We 'll scout the area , check for any life forms . Daly out .

 Cole , we should head out this way .
 Cole ...
 It 's kind of hot here , don 't you think ?
 Oh , my God .
 What are you doing , Cole ?
 The water looks so inviting , doesn 't it ?
 What are you talking about ?
 Come on , Robert .
 Ooh !
 Oh , the water is great .
 Swimming is a leisure activity .
 We 're on Space Fleet duty . You know what ?
 We could always say that I started drowning and you had to come in and rescue me .
 Yeah ?

 Oh , what about that ?
 Come on . Come on in .
 I ...
 Cole .
 - Come on . - Cole .
 Come on .
 Come on in , my big captain .

 OK .
 Come on .
 Are you gonna take all day ?
 OK .
 OK , I 'm coming in .

 OK , gotta patch it in .

 It worked . I 'm connected . - Gonna access her PhotoCloud account .
 - You remember that password ?
 Uppercase Y998 , lowercase gb7 , uppercase TY ampersand 4 .
 Secure choice .
 There are thousands of images .
 This could take a while .
 Boring life .

 Goddamn .
 That is ... gymnastic physique .
 It 's nice ... nice bedding .


 Oh .
 OK , should I keep scrolling ?
 Any of the last nine would do .

 Ow !
 - Thank you .
 - Pleasure . - Um , are you heading out for the night ?
 - Yes . Because it 's Christmas Eve and we 've got ten days off work to recover from it .
 Go home . - I will .
 I just have to finish -- - Yeah , whatever .
 Merry Christmas , loser .
 Yeah .
 OK , Merry Christmas .


 Oh , my God .
 Elliott , you fucking asshole .



 Nanette Cole , we 've hacked your PhotoCloud account and have control of the entire contents of your photo gallery .
 Who is this ? Um ...
 What do you want ?
 What we want is for you to do exactly as instructed or your entire gallery will be shared with your friends and your family .

 And PornHub .
 OK , yeah .
 I 'll do what you want , anything . I 'll do anything .
 Then listen carefully .
 We don 't have much time .
 Stand up , get your coat and follow our instructions .
 OK .
 - Where are we going ?
 - We 're just swimming .
 It 's nice , right ?
 - Yes . - Yeah .
 We should probably head back . Help !
 Something grabbed me , I think .
 No , it didn 't .
 I don 't think anything did .
 I 'm sorry . I think I imagined it .
 So stupid .
 That 's funny ...

 - That 's funny .
 - Yeah , it is funny .
 It 's funny .


 Easy , Cole .


 - All right , I 'm in position .
 - OK , we 're gonna hang up now . Make the phone call . Be sure to complete the rest of your mission .
 - I will .
 - You better .
 OK , I 'll send it back down .

 Oh !
 Hi .
 This is fucking crazy .


 Fenzi 's .
 Yes , I 'd like to order a pizza .
 Sure .
 What do you want ?

 Oop .
 I guess you 'd better get that .
 See who ...
 - Hold on .
 - Yeah .

 - It 's the door .
 - Oh , OK .
 Pause game .


 - Dudani , pick me up . - You got it . Stand by .
 Coming .



 - Hello ? - Uh , pizza . I didn 't order a pizza .
 OK , look , someone did , OK ?
 So do you want it or not ?
 Because ...
 I can 't take it back .

 What the hell am I doing ?
 All right !

 OK . That 's the signal .
 She 's got the DNA . All of it .
 Tommy too .
 Packer , we ready to fly ?
 Uh- huh .

 Well ?
 You 're supposed to say something like " engage " or " increase thrust . "
 Just fucking go . There you go .

 So I got it here in under ten .
 There 's supposed to be 30 in it for me . Yeah .
 What 's happening ?
 The door is closing . Hello ?
 Hello ? Hello ? Shit ...
 Come on , man .
 Hello ? Come on , man , you promised .

 Nice .
 Nice .
 Merry Christmas , asshole !

 Resume game .

 Resume game .

 Can 't we go any faster ?
 That dud disk isn 't gonna fool him forever .
 The update is gonna complete before long and that means bye- bye , wormhole .
 The only quicker route is through that asteroid belt there .
 - Let 's go that way . - No , it 's way too dense .
 If the ship broke up we wouldn 't die , we 'd just be left in space .
 Until Daly works out what 's happening .
 Then he 'll find us and he 'll fuck us over .

 Resume game .
 Lieutenant Cole , we should head ...
 Cole ?

 Daly to bridge .
 What 's going on ? - Shit . He has a backup disk .
 - Come in , bridge .
 No , don 't answer him .
 Dudani ?


 God damn it .
 The wormhole , it 's decreasing in size .
 Upload must be in the last few percent .
 Damn it , Packer , we are gonna have to go through the belt .
 Do you think that you can do that ?
 - Think I can try .
 - OK .

 - Ship 's computer on .
 - Computer , where 's the USS Callister ?
 USS Callister is on course .
 - On course for where ?
 - The wormhole .
 - What wormhole ?
 - The update vortex .
 Sons of bitches !
 Prepare for takeoff .





 I 've got a heat signature .
 Looks like a shuttle took off from Skillane IV .
 Oh , God , it 's Daly .


 Shields at 86 % .
 We 're taking a beating here !
 Incoming transmission .
 Hello ? Loyal trusty crew , come in .
 I know you can hear me .
 Whatever it is you think you 're going to do won 't work , but it is going to cost you !
 - Let 's go faster .
 - Already at maximum .
 Daly can 't touch us unless he makes it on board , and that 's shuttle 's a jalopy .
 - He won 't catch us in time .
 - I hope you 're right .
 Shields 58 % .

 If you thought what happened to you in the past was bad , that was nothing !
 What I 'm going to do to you is going to be goddamn fucking biblical ! I 'm literally going to turn your insides out .
 But I 'll keep you alive in tiny little jars and there you 'll stay until I 'm bored of you --
 - Why are we listening to this ?
 - Yes , fuck him !
 We 're at the edge of the belt .
 I think we 're gonna make it .

 - What was that ?
 - Primary drive . I 've lost all thrust .
 Engines not responding .
 We 're drifting here .
 USS Callister has lost engine power .
 I 'm coming to get you !
 Hello ! Is there any way that we can fix the engines ?

 That 's only feasible manually , by climbing inside the jet fader .
 So ... ? So you 'd burn to a crisp when the jet came on .
 - We 'd burn without dying .
 - So one of us needs to go . OK .
 One of us already has .
 Walton ?
 I 'm pretty sure I can fix this .
 Um , uh ... Walton , are you sure about this ?
 I 'm sure .
 Tulaska , can you patch me through to Daly ?
 Patching through .
 Hey , Daly , can you hear me ?
 - Walton ?
 - Robert ? Hey . - Walton , you 're going to pay for this .
 - Robert , listen . - I 'm going to bring Tommy back in . - Hey , Robert --
 God so help me , you are going to regret all of this so hard !
 Bob , I wanna talk to you here !
 I was thinking I should say ... sorry .
 Go on .
 You created Infinity .
 You 're a fucking genius .
 I exploited that .
 I treated you like a golden goose and I got fat on the profits , figuratively speaking .
 And I was thinking I should have appreciated you more , you know ?
 I should have treated you better .
 Yeah , yeah , I was thinking I should say all that .
 But you threw my son out of an airlock , so fuck you to death .


 Walton ?
 Walton ?

 We 've got power back .


 - Faster !
 - Speed already at maximum . I don 't care , whatever , just catch them !
 Wormhole almost closed .
 Daly 's gaining on us .
 - Keep her steady . Keep steady .
 - I 'm trying .
 Come on , come on .
 I hope we are going to die .


 Goddamn it !
 Damn it !
 Fuck !


 What happened ?
 The mod 's gone .
 Daly 's Space Fleet mod has been stripped away by the firewall . - OK , so ... this is good .
 - We 're still alive .
 Yeah , it only erased the Space Fleet mod .
 We 're not on Daly 's computer anymore . - We 're in the cloud .
 - Where is Daly ?
 Firewall 's deleted his rogue game code , and his controls were disabled .
 - You mean ... ? - He 's stuck there .
 Update complete .
 Wormhole closed .
 - Controls are disabled . - No .
 No . No , no , no !
 - Assholes !
 - Hey ! - Yeah ! What 's up ?
 - The brig unlocked itself . My Valdack outfit turned into this .
 More to the point , I 'm not a beetle thing anymore .
 I 've got my body back .
 I 've got my whole body back . I 'm guessing we all have .

 So what do we do now ?
 We 've got an infinite procedurally generated universe at our disposal .
 We can go anywhere .
 Holy mackerel .

 Incoming transmission .
 - It says Gamer691 .
 - That 's a player tag .
 Another ship , another player .
 We 're online . Um ...
 Hey , patch 'em through .
 - Um , hello . - Hey there .
 Uh , this is the crew of the USS Callister .
 Oh , man , are we glad to hear from --
 Yeah , Merry Christmas . So are we gonna blow each other or are we gonna trade ?
 Oh ... Hmm .
 Hello . Do you have anything to trade at all ?
 - No , uh -- - So why did you respond ?
 OK , just get the hell out of my quadrant or I 'll blast you to shit .
 - You got ten seconds .
 Ten ... - Oh , well , do ... do try .
 We 'll photon- bolt you up the perineum , you stupid little boy .
 - Scary . Nine .
 - Come on , then . - Yes , thank you , Shania .
 Um ... - Eight . - Nate ?

 - Yes , Captain ?
 Stick us in hyperwarp and let 's ... - Six . - ... fuck off somewhere .
 - Five .
 - Aye aye , Captain . - Really , Nanette is fine . - Four .
 - Aye aye , Nanette . - Three . Two .
 One !
 Uh- huh . You 'd better run .
 King of space right here .
