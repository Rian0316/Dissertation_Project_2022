 I have another child , Lynette .
 You didn 't wanna give me permission , remember ?
 Not to sleep with the woman who 's carrying our child !

 Do I know you ? - Orson Hodge , Susan 's dentist friend .



 Something awful happened






 Mama loves her baby .
 Does the baby love mama ?
 Mama !



 Oh !
 Baby , you gotta come down now . Mama 's in a hurry .
 Hurry !
 Hurry !
 If you don 't get back in your cage right now ,
 I 'm gonna have to leave you behind .
 Please !


 Alma ?
 Are you home ?
 Carolyn ?
 I 'm just looking for Alma .
 We had a coffee date this morning .
 She never showed .
 Uh , Alma left yesterday .
 Left ?
 We had a bit of a row . Oh .
 Harvey and I thought we heard some raised voices .
 So where 'd she go ? don 't know , but I wouldn 't worry about it .
 I 'm sure she 's fine .
 Orson , no !
 So if I hear from Alma , I 'll let her know that you dropped by .







 Here , you can have this .








 Welcome , welcome .
 Oh .
 Don 't worry about the water the floors are laminated .
 Here 's a flyer .
 And then the police found her severed fingers in the garage .
 And they never found Felicia 's body .
 I wouldn 't be surprised if someday you opened a cabinet , and ... hello !
 Karen , dear .
 Have you seen the marble backsplash ?
 Oh , I just must show it to you .
 Excuse us .
 What are you trying to do to me , you backstabbing cow ?
 They asked why the owner was selling .
 I told them that Paul young was in jail .
 They asked why .
 Conversation has a flow . Well , knock it off .

 I 've been trying to unload this house of horrors for months now , and you are not helping .
 Ah- ah- ah !
 Those are for potential buyers , you withered old mooch .
 Good luck trying to find one of those .
 Maybe you 'll have an easier time with the Applewhite house and that rec room in the basement .
 Get out .
 Get out .
 Get out , get out , get out ! do you have a moment ?
 Yes , yes , yes , yes .
 Is Kayla ready yet ?
 Honey , thank you for this .
 I know it 's a little weird , I mean , to send out a family Christmas photo with your husband 's love child , but it means a lot to her to feel included . no problem , she 's a great little girl .

 Okay ?
 All right , let 's do this .
 I am just going to , um , check the focus .
 Nora .
 Lynette .
 What are you doing there ?
 Well , it 's a family photo , right ?
 Tom , could I - could I - could I check your tie again ?
 She sat down so quickly , I didn 't know what to say .
 How about , " you 're in the frame , bitch . Move " ?

 No , I am sorry .
 How much of her crap do I have to put up with ?
 First , it 's the little drop- bys .
 Then she 's inviting herself to dinner three times a week .
 Now she wants to be in our Christmas photo ?
 I 'm sorry . No , that 's not happening .
 Hey , guys .
 Don 't fight .
 It 's the holidays .

 I would prefer if you weren 't in it .
 Okay .
 Kayla , honey , we gotta go .
 They 're kicking us out .
 We didn 't say that Kayla couldn 't be in the photo .
 Yeah , well , you know what ?

 It 's okay .
 I don 't have to be in the picture .
 Fine !
 Fine .
 No , absolutely fine .
 Put crazy at the end , and we can crop her out later .
 Fair enough . Fair enough .
 Hey , everything 's okay .
 It 's okay .
 Come on , guys . Come on back .

 Back to the Christmas spirit that I was looking for .
 Ten seconds !
 I think this is a little stiff .
 I have a really fun idea .
 Where are my crackers ?
 We 're out , but I got you a pickle .
 Pickles and soup ?
 Who eats that ?
 You know , that 's all I got .
 Ever heard of a store ?
 You did not just do that .
 I hate pickles . Pick it up .
 Doctor say I only get out of bed to pee .
 Better for baby , remember ?
 Don 't go .
 I need you to rub my feet .
 They 're sore , and doctor say - Oh , cut it out , Xiao- mei .
 The doctor didn 't say anything .
 About rubbing your chubby stumps .
 Rub 'em yourself .
 You treat me like dirt .
 Would you rather go live with Mr. Solis in a dingy one- bedroom apartment with no air conditioning and no cable , huh ?
 No , I didn 't think so .
 You are meanest person I know .

 You 've been in this country a year .
 Modify your nouns , damn it !

 I can 't wait for you to pop out that baby , because when you do ,
 I am putting you on the first plane back to shanghai , and you 're gonna be on all fours in a rice paddy before the epidural wears off !
 But you promised to get me apartment in Chinatown , so I can work for my friend in restaurant , start a new life .
 Tell it to my Chinese friend - sue me !
 You know , we do have people here in the hospital who could do that .
 But I like doing it . I think Mike would want me to .
 Oops .
 Oh .
 So have you got the results of his latest M. R. I. yet ?
 I 'm afraid there was no change . Oh .
 Well , how long until you can do another one ?
 I don 't want to tell you not to be optimistic , but -
 look , I know it 's been six months , but he could still come out of it , right ?
 I saw in the news there was this woman in Peru .
 She woke up after ten years .
 - There 's a reason that made the news . you might think I 'm naive , but I know he 's coming back to me .
 Susan - don 't say it .
 You just keep doing your job , and I 'll keep doing mine .
 Oops .
 That risotto was perfect .
 Just like you .
 Listen , I hope you saved room for dessert .
 I got us something special from a wonderful little bakery downtown . Oh !
 That is so adorable , but I don 't think I can eat another bite .
 Well , here , let me take half .
 What do you say , Bree ?
 Will you marry me ?
 a little sudden , isn 't it ?
 We 've only known each other six months , but I 've loved you every minute of it .
 But if you don 't share my feelings - No , no . Um ...
 I do .
 It 's just that , um , I can 't help being cautious .
 Since Rex , I haven 't been exactly lucky in love .
 I used to feel the same way .
 When Alma left me , I was shattered , but I realize now it was the luckiest day of my life because it meant I was free when I met you .
 Luck can change , Bree .
 Let me change yours .
 Yes .
 Yes ?






 Two ... three - oh , itch , itch , itch , itch , itch .
 Ooh !
 Itch , itch , itch .
 Do the nurses know you do this ?
 Oh , hey ! Um , you weren 't supposed to see that .
 Well , clearly .
 Now , you can buy my silence if you 'll have coffee with me .
 Oh , I would love to , but I think I 'm in a rush here .
 I 'm supposed to meet my girlfriends for lunch at 1 : 00 . Is it 1 : 00 yet ?
 Well , you tell me .
 I notice you 're always rushing into the hall to check the time , so I , um ...
 Well , I bought you this . Oh !
 Wow .
 I - I - I can 't accept this .
 This is too extravagant .
 Oh , no , it 's nothing .
 There was a guy on the sidewalk - had a bunch of them laid out on a blanket .
 If you look closely , it says " Folex . "

 Well , in that case , thank you for my cheap knockoff . Oh , my god .
 I 'm late .


 Hi !
 Hi , hi , hi . Hi !
 I 'm so sorry I 'm late .
 No , that 's fine .
 Wow , white gloves .
 What , are we having luncheon in the 1880s ?
 Well , it 's a very elegant club .
 You know , Orson 's been a member here for years .
 It 'll be even nicer when they finish the construction .
 So you were very mysterious on the phone .
 Why did you wanna have lunch ?
 Well , I wanted to invite you to a dinner that Orson and I are having this Saturday .
 So you asked us to a meal to announce another meal ? That 's so ...
 Bree of you . What 's the occasion ?
 Oh , um , no occasion .
 Just a little get- together .
 What are you being so coy about ?
 I 'm not being coy .
 She said coyly .
 If you don 't tell us , we 're not coming .
 Oh , all right .
 I wanted to wait and make a proper announcement , but ...
 Orson and I are engaged .
 Oh , my gosh !
 Oh , let me see !
 You move fast .
 I know it 's quick , but it just feels so right .
 Orson is just the most warm , wonderful , generous man .
 Oh , generous . That means he 's good in the sack .
 Actually , uh , no .
 We haven 't had sex yet .
 We 're waiting until we get married .
 Oh , my god . You 're serious ?
 Not even ...
 Whatever you 're alluding to , no . But - but you 're gonna get married .
 You wouldn 't buy a car without at least taking it for a little test drive .
 It 's not like you 've never slept with a guy you weren 't married to . True .
 Uh , I have in the past given myself away too freely .
 How charming of you to bring that up while I 'm announcing my engagement .
 But I like to think that I have learned from my mistakes .
 I 'm just gonna replay the look I had when I found out you hadn 't So the dinner is at 8 : 00 , and when we make the announcement , please , everybody , look surprised .
 Okay . No , don 't worry .


 Hey , sexy mama .
 So you invited Kayla to Parker 's birthday party , right ?
 Of course . And ?
 - And ?
 What did you tell Nora ?
 I told her that we were picking up Kayla for a quiet afternoon at home . You lied ?
 Yeah , you 're damn straight I lied .
 I will not have that lunatic ruining one more family gathering .
 But Kayla 's gonna , you know , tell Nora that we had a party , and I 'm just afraid that Nora 's gonna blow a gasket .
 What ?
 So what are you saying , you 're more afraid of Nora than you are of me ?
 Is - is that what you think
 I meant because that is so not what I meant .
 You scare the hell out of me , baby . Thank you .

 The coffee machine was broken , so I got us a couple of smoothies .
 They had strawberry and strawberry .
 Well , I hate strawberry , so give me the strawberry .
 Hi , Jane . but I wouldn 't mind having some real food sometime .
 May- maybe we could go to a restaurant .
 You mean , like , outside the hospital ?
 Yeah , you know , l- like a date .
 Oh , um ...
 There 's a lovely little bistro down the street .
 I 'm really , really sorry .
 that sounds , uh , just - that sounds great !
 I mean , I hope that 's okay . Yeah !
 Uh ...
 So , I was , um , I was thinking about how that sounded just now - the , uh , the- the date thing .
 I really sprang it on you out of nowhere .
 Yes , you did .
 Jane looked cold .
 Oh .
 Thanks .
 Look , we 're , um , we 're both in difficult situations .
 I 've been in mine a lot longer than you have , so , uh , if you 're not ready , I understand .
 If you ever be , uh , let- let me know .
 Wow , I am really hungry .
 Well , then let 's , um , let 's go to the blood bank and swipe some- some sugar cookies .
 Oh , uh , you might want to give Jane a sponge bath ' cause she had a little ... accident .



 Are you having a party ? Quiet , quiet , quiet , quiet !
 Shh !
 Yeah , no , no , of course not .
 In fact , we 're just having a quiet afternoon at home .
 Um , the kids are so bored .
 Tom and I were thinking of taking 'em out for ice cream .
 Well , would you tell Kayla that mommy called to check on her ?
 Oh , I will , I will , and I 'll see you tonight .
 Okay .
 Bye .
 You think she bought it ? No .
 I think she 'll be over here in ten minutes .
 Okay , let 's move ! Let 's move !
 I 've got 10 bucks here for the kid who can carry the most stuff , okay ?
 Hey , Gaby , it 's Lynette . Got a little emergency here .
 Is it okay if we use your backyard ?
 Great .
 Great .
 And we take complete responsibility for whatever the pony does .
 Hope you get this message soon .
 Oh !
 My only concern would be the neighborhood .
 We really need a quiet place for our retirement .
 Oh , are you kidding ?
 There 's no place in Fairview that 's more peaceful .
 Okay , guys , come on , come on , come on !
 Let me show you the media room .
 Okay , go on in . Got the balloons ?
 Good .
 Good . All right .
 Okay , all right , that 's it .
 Everybody 's in .
 Where 's the cake ?
 Oh , crap !
 Anybody home ?
 Hello ? Hey , Nora .
 Wow .
 We weren 't expecting you until 7 : 00 . So where 's Kayla ?
 I thought I told you .
 Tom took the kids to the movies . Unh- unh .
 You said ice cream . Uh- huh . After the movies .
 Movies , then ice cream -- an American tradition .
 So , is something wrong ?
 To be honest , I thought that you were lying and having a party . I guess I was wrong .
 Oh , apology accepted .
 Want me to walk you to your car ?

 Where did everybody go ?
 Nora , look , I am sorry I lied , but you know , you gave me no choice , and --
 Lynette , I want my daughter .
 Where 's the damn party ? No , I 'm not telling .
 Where 's the party ?
 No !
 No , no !
 If you want in , you 're gonna have to go through me .
 I want my kid , Lynette .
 Kayla !
 Kayla , come out here now !
 What is going on ?
 Well , first you have a party , and you don 't invite me , and then you lie about it , so now we 're leavin ' .
 Well , wait a minute .
 Hold on , hold on , hold on , hold on , Kayla .
 I 'm sorry . We 're -- we 're sorry .
 We -- we shouldn 't have done that .
 But look , Kayla is having such a good time .
 Why don 't we all just come on in and have some cake , and we can just -- Lynette , Lynette .
 We can just have fun .
 Could you excuse me for one second ?
 Lynette .
 Okay , okay , I know , but what else could I do ? I 'm just thinking of Kayla .
 I know you are , Tom , and I know you love her .
 Why else do you think I 'm willing to put up with all this for six months ?
 Why do you think I 'm willing to say to my college roommates ,
 " Yes , that 's my husband 's love child and her mother in our Christmas picture " ?
 Because I am your wife !
 You always come first with me .
 Do I still come first with you ?
 I guess I 'll see you later , Nora . Well ...
 I 'm taking Kayla .
 Well , that 's a shame .
 I 've gotta go hoist a piñata .
 Mommy , they have a piñata .
 Fine !
 I 'll be back at 7 : 00 .
 But there had better be a corner piece of cake waiting for me .
 Come on , Kayla . Go -- go have some fun . Go have some ...

 Thank you for that . Sure .
 I 'll be back in 20 minutes .
 Gonna go buy a piñata ?
 I sure am .
 Xiao- mei ?
 Come on out ! I have your lunch .
 Xiao- mei , your favorite soap is on .
 There 's a doctor fondling a patient on the operating table . You 're missing it !
 Xiao- mei ?
 Oh , I 'll have to examine you .
 Xiao- mei ?

 Hey , quick question .
 Have you , by any chance , seen Xiao- mei ?
 I can 't believe you lost our baby .
 I did not lose our baby . Stop saying that .
 I know exactly where it is -- inside some crazy Chinese woman who also stole half a chicken from my fridge .
 Hi !
 Hi .
 Liang , right ?
 Remember me ?
 Xiao- mei lives with me .
 You came over . We had lunch .
 You got some nerve showing your face here .
 Get out . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
 Hey !
 Uh , what happened to that famous Chinese hospitality ? Xiao- mei called me .
 She said you threatened to send her back to china to work as a slave in a rice paddy .
 I ...
 I may have mentioned deportation , but I didn 't think she 'd take it personally .
 Are you crazy ? It was banter .
 I mean , has this country come to the point where you can 't joke with the help ?
 You treat Xiao- mei like dirt .
 She 's just a poor , innocent girl trying to live the American dream , just like your ancestors .
 Oh , don 't give me that " we are the world " crap .
 That woman 's uterus is harboring a stolen baby .
 So if you know where she is , you better start talking , or else I 'm gonna get the health department down here and take a closer look at what you 're serving as Mu shu pork .

 Boy , those people just don 't have a sense of humor , do they ?
 I 'm telling you , at this number , it 's not gonna last long .
 Well , we like the neighborhood , but we 've heard that some odd things have gone on with this house .
 Complete fabrication .
 Malicious lies spread by jealous competitors .
 Now you 've gotta check out this storage .
 You 're not gonna believe what you can fit in here .

 And now the media room . Wow , you certainly devoured that ice cream .
 Can I get you anything else ?
 You tell me . Hmm .
 Orson ...
 Mmm . Mmm .
 Mmm .
 I thought we ...
 Orson . Mm ?
 Oh , I just assumed now that we 're engaged ...
 Well , does that change our core values ?
 No .
 But when I saw you standing in front of the freezer with a clingy silk dress , let 's just say , well , that challenged them .
 Well , I thought we agreed we wanted our wedding night to be perfect .
 Yes , but actors want opening night to be perfect .
 That 's why they rehearse .
 It 'll be better this way .
 Now ... can I get you some more ice cream ?
 Not in that dress .

 Hi .

 So I need to ask you something .
 Ian , you know , from across the hall -- You met him .
 Anyway ... he sort of asked me out ... on a date .
 I know you 're thrown .
 I was thrown , too .
 But he 's really nice , and ...
 I could sort of use someone to talk to ... who also talks back .

 the thing is ...
 I 'm sort of lonely ... and the past six months have been really hard on me .
 So what I need is ...
 I need to know that it 's okay with you if I go out with him .
 Because if it 's not , I won 't .
 In fact , I 'd like nothing better than for you to just wake up right now and tell me not to go out with him .
 Just wake up and tell me . Wake up .
 Please !

 All right .
 I 'll see you tomorrow .
 I love you .

 It is really just dinner .

 I 'm just dropping off Carlos , and then I 'll be by to pick her up . Okay , thanks , Edie .
 Xiao- mei 's fine .
 Crisis averted .
 No harm , no foul .
 How can you say that ?
 You endangered the life of our baby today .
 Don 't you dare give me that attitude .
 You have no idea what I 've been going through these past six months .
 I have had to wait hand and foot on your mistress .
 I mean , imagine if the day after you found out about John Rowland , you had to make his lunch and rub his feet .
 Yeah , well , John Rowland wasn 't carrying our kid .
 Forgive me for being concerned about our surrogate .
 Xiao- mei is going to be fine .
 Once that baby comes , her slate is wiped clean .
 She 's gonna walk away , go off and live American dream .
 I 'm gonna be stuck , a single mother raising a child alone , haggling with lawyers on who gets the kid at Christmas .
 Me ?
 My American dream is officially dead .
 I 'm sorry .
 Thank you .
 But just so you know , my dream hasn 't exactly --
 Okay , so we will see you Saturday , and please pretend to be surprised . Bye . You told someone else ?
 Bree , I thought the whole point of the party was to announce our engagement .
 I just can 't help it .
 I like telling people . Makes me feel ...
 I don 't know . makes me feel like I 'm starting over .
 It feels good .
 Feels good to me , too , though .
 Hmm .
 Ah , no hands .
 See ?
 Ahem .
 Hmm .
 Hmm .
 Oh , you don 't have to wash those .
 I already did that .
 Oh , I found some streaks , so I 'm wiping them down with undiluted red wine vinegar .
 I 've never heard of that .
 Oh , sure .
 For tougher spots , I use a 50- 50 mix of denatured alcohol and water .
 Ah .
 And for those really intractable stains -- I mean , we 're talking shower doors --
 I wipe on lacquer thinner with a towel .

 Bree ?
 Oh , Orson .
 Ohh !
 Uh ... excuse me .
 Hmm ?
 Did you lose something ?


 Oh ! Um , I don 't do that .
 Why not ?
 I 'm a republican .
 I 'm a libertarian .
 I believe in minimizing the role of the state and maximizing individual rights .
 But , Orson !
 Trust me .
 I know what I 'm doing .
 Okay .

 Aah !
 Oh , no !
 What , you didn 't just crack that veneer again , did you ?
 I have to go . Go ?
 Go where ?
 And then it was like something inside ruptured .
 Well , not so much a rupture as a spasm .
 Waves of this hot clutching .
 I think I might have had a small stroke .
 How severe were the pains ? Well , that 's the odd thing .
 I mean , there was no pain per se .
 In fact , it wasn 't entirely unpleasant .
 What were you doing at the time ?
 I was , uh , with my fiancé .
 We were lying down ... resting .
 I 'm gonna take a wild swing here .
 Were you having sex ?

 Sort of .
 Ms. Van De Kamp , I think you may have had an orgasm .
 No , no , no . I had orgasms before .
 Mm , how would you describe them ?
 Oh , you know , that warm sensation , that tingling feeling of relief when it 's over .
 No , no , this was much ...
 Better ? Yes .
 That 's 'cause it was an orgasm .
 Oh .
 Well , I 'll be darned .

 Hi .
 Can I help you ?
 Are you Bree Van De Kamp ?
 Yes , and you are ?
 Carolyn Bigsby .
 I was Orson 's neighbor .
 Oh , well , come on in .
 Let 's dry you off and get you a drink .
 I didn 't come here to celebrate .
 Carolyn .
 Engaged again ? That was quick work .
 Does she know you killed your wife ?
 My wife me .
 And no one ever heard from her again .
 Not me , not her family .
 Just dropped off the face of the earth .

 Orson , what is she talking about ?
 Didn 't tell you that part , did he ?
 All right , Carolyn , you 've made your little scene .
 You keep your hands off me . Don 't let him fool you .
 Get away from him now while you can .

 Please leave my house .
 Fine . Be a fool .
 Marry him .
 Just don 't be surprised when you go missing , too .

 I 'm sorry you had to endure that .
 Your wife ... disappeared ?
 I tried to find her .
 Her family claimed not to have heard from her .
 Personally , I think she was just trying to punish me . So ... are you still married ?
 No , I was granted a divorce on grounds of abandonment .
 Bree ... you can 't possibly think that --
 No , of course not .
 I love you .
 And I love you .

 Orson ...
 My hand .
 The buffet is open .
 Bree ...
