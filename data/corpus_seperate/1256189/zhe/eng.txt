 Downloaded From www . AllSubs . org I am not impressed with the talent in here tonight . And the more I drink , the less attractive they get .
 I 'm one scotch and soda away from the Cantina scene in
 What about those girls over there ? They 're hot . - They 're not hot .
 - Are you kidding ?
 I hated their guts the second I saw them .
 Which means they 're hot .
 In fact , I hated them almost as much as I hated Robin when I first met her .
 - You hated me ?
 - A lot . Barney , they 're hot .
 There is so much to teach you all .
 You have just become victims of ...
 " the Cheerleader Effect " .
 Glad you asked .
 The Cheerleader Effect is when group of women seems hot but only as a group .
 Just like with cheerleaders .
 They seem hot , but take each one of them individually ? Sled dogs .
 That 's insane .
 Take a good , hard look at each one of those girls .
 Individually .

 I don 't know .
 The one on the end is kind of cute .
 Yeah , she really is .
 And that , my friends , is " The Cheerleader Effect " .
 Also known as the Bridesmaid Paradox ,
 Sorority Girl Syndrome , and for a brief window in the mid - ' 90s , the Spice Girls Conspiracy .
 Scary Spice indeed .

 Barney Stinson .
 Okay .
 Got it .
 Great , we 'll be in touch .

 What ?
 Apparently , I 'm gonna be a dad .

 Synchro :
 ShalimarFox , Arrow
 You 're gonna be a dad ?
 How did this happen ?
 It was just some girl I hook up with a few weeks back .
 She 's not sure .
 She 's gonna go to the doctor in the morning .
 Maybe it 's a false alarm .
 Maybe she 's not pregnant .
 No part of Barney Stinson does anything less than 110 % .
 If one of my little Michael Phelpses got loose , he 's swimming for the gold .
 Oh , this is a nightmare .
 I don 't want kids . Who in their right mind would ever want kids ?


 Oh , come on .

 Did you lose a sock there , little dude ?

 That is without a doubt the cutest little thing I 've ever seen .
 There 's my little peanut .

 So , if we have a baby , do you think you could work fewer hours ?
 Doesn 't matter , he 's gonna be so cute , I 'm gonna eat him up on the first day .
 Okay . But what about money ?
 We 're still in a ton of debt .
 We 'll count our overdue bills on his teenie tiny fingers .
 Let 's have a baby .

 Oh , oh , right now ? Oh , okay .

 Scooch over . I TiVo 'd

 So , Robin , how 's the job and apartment search going ?
 You didn 't hear ?
 I 'm the lead anchor on CNN .
 And I got a penthouse overlooking Central Park made of gold .
 Get your head out of your ass , Marshall .

 So , Robin , would you mind crashing at Ted 's tomorrow night ?
 I 'm ... cooking Marshall a special dinner .
 Just dinner .
 That 's it .
 Nothing else . Fine .
 But you 'd better not be as uptight as these idiots about me shooting beer cans on the roof .
 " It hurt my ears .
 " The neighbors called the cops .
 You almost hit me . " Enjoy her , Ted .
 She 's in a real good place right now .


 God ?
 It 's me .
 Barney . What up ?


 I know we don 't talk much , though a lot of girls call out your name because of me .
 Awesome .
 But , God ...
 If you could get me out of this ,
 I swear I will never ever , ever , ever , ever , ever , ever ...

 Oh , hang on , bro .
 Go for Barney .

 Really ?


 Great news ! I 'm not a father !
 Congratulations , buddy .
 This is the happiest moment of my life , Marshall .
 The way I feel about not having kids ?
 I never knew I could love something this much .
 That 's why I 'm creating a holiday .
 From now on , today will be known as " Not a Father 's Day . "
 - You 're creating a holiday ? - Why not ?
 Everyone else gets a day : mothers , fathers , bastilles .
 Why can 't there be a day for people who are single and like it that way ?
 Now you just sound like the chubby girl on Valentine 's Day .
 - Hello , Stinson . - Hey , Nolan .
 How are the kids ?


 You ready for tonight , Eriksen ? Big merger .
 That 's between me and my wife , sir .
 The meeting with Mr. Li .
 Tonight . I thought that was a breakfast meeting .



 It is . Breakfast in China .
 We 're teleconferencing with the Chinese . I 'm counting on you , kid .



 - Marshall ?
 - Hey , babe .
 - It 's breakfast time in China .
 - Yeah , it is .
 Not a euphemism .
 Look , I ... - Wait , what would that even mean ?

 - I don 't know , hot buns , spicy pork ?
 There 's something there . You 're not coming home tonight , are you ?


 Are you shaking your head " no " ?

 I thought so .
 Thank you , guys , for coming over so fast .
 Are you all right ?
 You sounded upset on the phone .
 Marshall and I made this big decision to have ... dinner .
 And I thought
 I was ready to have ... dinner .
 Is it too early for us to have ... dinner ?
 But then he called and canceled , and it got me thinking .
 I had an early lunch , so I 'm ready for dinner .
 - Dinner is a baby !
 - Lily , that 's horrible !
 No , no , I need you guys to figure something out for me .
 What ?
 Are Marshall and I ready to have a baby ?


 So , are Marshall and I ready to have a baby or not ?
 Lily , we can 't make this decision for you .
 It 's huge . You know what else is huge ?
 Marshall 's head . That thing 's the size of a late August watermelon .

 Marshall 's baby coming through there ?

 - What does Marshall think ?
 - Probably a lot in that 1950s space helmet of a head he 's walking around with .
 Marshall really excited .
 But I think he only sees what 's cute about having a baby , not what 's hard about it .

 Thanks so much for inviting us over .
 I have not talked to another adult in ,
 like , weeks . Besides my husband .
 But " It 's your turn to change him " and " Make him shut up " really doesn 't count as conversation .
 Sorry , I 'm rambling .
 I haven 't gotten laid in seven months . I just did it again !
 Sleep deprivation !
 Oh , wait , I 'm not crying , am I ?
 I usually am . I don 't mean to complain .
 Now I feel bad !

 There 's my little peanut ! Oh , I love you so much !
 I 'm going to be as strung out as Charlotte .
 Worse actually . At least her husband works from home .

 I mean , he 's a pot dealer , but he 's a very involved parent .
 - Marshall will be a great dad .
 - Marshall 's always at the office , and I 'm afraid that if we have a baby now , all the work will fall on me .
 You 're just panicking and focusing on the downside .
 I think Lily 's just being realistic .
 See , this is good .
 This is why I called you guys both over here . Ted , you 're pro kids .
 Robin , you 're against .
 Counselors , opening statements .
 Okay , I know you 're afraid that you 're not ready .
 But no one ever thinks they 're ready .
 You just have to take the leap . Parenthood will come naturally .
 Of course you think it comes naturally .
 - You 're basically a dad already .
 - You 're a total dad .
 - What are you talking about ?
 - Ted , think about it .

 Shredded tweet !


 Shredded tweet !

 I 'm not angry .
 I 'm just disappointed . - She did it !
 - Shut up !

 Hi , I 'm Lori .
 I 'll be your waitress this evening . Hi , Lori , I 'm Ted .
 I 'll be your customer this evening .
 Hey , Lori , before you go , tell me , what do you get when you cross a canary with a lawn mower ?
 No hints .
 She 's right .
 You maybe single and childless , but you 're totally a dorky dad .
 I don 't think I like your tone , young lady .
 Not a Father 's Day is a hit !
 Laraby and Finklestein are helping me celebrate .
 Check it . " World 's Greatest Not A Dad " mugs .

 There 's ...
 " Who 's Not Your Daddy ? " t- shirts .
 Both available at Not- A- Father 's- Day . com .
 Check out the greeting cards .

 " Your Porsche Carrera rules the freeway , Here 's wishing you " an all night three- way . Happy Not a Father 's Day . "
 Check out the illustration .


 It appears to be some sort of Asian hooker .
 Because on Not a Father 's Day , you get a Thai you 'd actually wear .
 Wordplay five !
 She 's really kicking your ass here .
 Your only hope is to go negative .
 Okay .
 I 'll tell you why my opponent is saying all this .
 Three words : scared of ...
 - babies . - What ?
 That is crazy . - I am not . - Yeah ?

 She is so cute !
 Do you want to hold her ?


 - Are you letting that baby sniff you ?

 - I don 't want to get bitten .




 - Talking baby commercial ?
 - Talking baby commercial . But you 're not like that .
 You love kids and they love you .
 Yes , I 'm loveable , pretty and wise , but is it enough ?
 Look , it all comes down to one word : " you " .
 Are you ready to put your own dreams on the back burner ?
 Grad school , teaching art at the college level ?
 Look , you need to focus on Project Lily before you can start Project Baby .
 If you don 't , you 'll always regret it . And that wouldn 't be fair to you or the baby .

 What 's that ?
 It 's Jeremy 's sock .
 I 'm having a baby .
 But what about all the things I just said ?
 But , but sock .
 But what about Marshall working all the time ?
 - But sock .
 - But , but Project Lily !
 Little fishies on it .
 We made all of these arguments , and a sock is what makes your decision for you ?
 I guess that was the sock- out punch , huh , Robin ?
 Shut up , Dad .
 You shut up , baby hater .
 Babies are scary , okay ?
 They have giant eyes .
 And then , come on , the soft spot ?
 If there 's gonna be a self- destruct button , at least hide it somewhere it won 't accidentally get pressed .
 Where 's Lily ?

 - Did you drink any of this ?
 - Not a drop .
 Me , neither .
 Meeting in five minutes .
 You 'd better bring your A- game for Mr. Li .
 That guy haunts my nightmares .
 Anyway , have fun out there , kid .

 Put a baby in me , Marshall . I 'm ready .

 - Lily , what are you doing here ?
 - I 'm ready .
 Tonight 's the night .
 Put your melon- headed spawn in my belly .
 What ? Come on , right now .
 Baby me .
 I 'm ready . Oh , hey , look . The guys in the next building are waving at me .



 Hello , gentlemen !
 We 're going to make a baby !
 I can 't believe we lost her .
 This is exactly why I 'm never having kids .
 You can 't let them out of your sight for even a second .
 I can 't find my file .
 I pulled out " A " through " G. "
 They just sit there with their stupid bottles .
 They cry .

 They spit up .
 And that 's why kids suck .
 It is a good thing we broke up .
 I forgot how totally psycho you are
 - on the kids thing . - I 'm psycho ?
 Any time you even hear the word " kids , " you get two little lactation stains on your shirt .
 Thank God you 're not a mom . You are such an ice queen .
 Any baby nursing from you would get brain freeze .
 Don 't paint me as some sort of a freak for wanting to remain independent .
 There are normal people out there who don 't want to have kids .
 Brother , lay your hand on this box of condoms and repeat after me .
 I , state the fake name you give to women .
 I , Johnny Banana .
 Vow to always choose wet T- shirts over wet diapers .
 - Vow to always ...
 - Yeah , you 're in great company there .
 I 'm gonna look for Lily in the bathroom .
 While I 'm in there , I 'll grab you a tampon .
 When you 're done shaking off at the urinal , maybe you could ask the wizard to give you a heart .
 Great .
 You know what ? Maybe I should find somewhere else
 - to stay this weekend . - No argument here .
 - Fine . - Great .
 Welcome to our fraternity of non- paternity .
 He is one of us .
 Gentlemen , Mr. Li , if you would all please open to page 5 of your merger documents .
 I think the ...

 - What is it , Eriksen ?
 - Nothing .
 I just think that you look ... very nice today .

 What are you looking at ?
 I am looking at the future ... of our two companies , and it looks very ... naked .

 Would you excuse me just for a brief second ?


 You guys didn 't have to ...
 It 's a picture of me with no kids .
 And there 's macaroni glued on the frame .
 Guys , I love it .
 Lily 's not in there . Your phone rang .
 I answered it . I hope you don 't mind .
 Marshall 's got Lily . She 's fine .
 Oh , thank God .

 What ?
 When I was putting your phone back , and I found something in your bag .
 I have a permit for that . And the other thing was a gift .

 This .
 You stole Jeremy 's sock .
 No , I didn 't .
 I don 't know how that got in there .
 It must 've fallen in . Weird ! - " Fallen in " ?
 - Or Lily put it in there as a joke .


 That bitch be drunk . I took it .

 It 's just ... so cute . Sock .

 Robin Scherbatsky , are you warming to the idea of having children ?
 I don 't know .
 Maybe someday . When I 'm , like , 70 .
 Science will catch up .
 Look , I 'm just ...
 I 'm confused lately . I 'm unemployed . I 'm living on a couch .
 It 's been a rough couple of months for both of us .

 I have a spare bedroom .
 Why don 't you stay with me while you look for a place ?
 - Really ?
 - Yeah . Thanks , Ted .
 I already have some leads , so it 'll be one week , two weeks tops .

 I 'm bored .
 Let 's go dancing . Let 's rob a liquor store !

 We 're not going anywhere .
 Whenever we go somewhere when you 're drunk , you always fall asleep as soon as we get in the ...

 We 're going dancing !
 We 're gonna party all night long !
 Can you circle the block a couple times just to make sure she 's really down ?
 Sure thing .
 Latest Not A Father 's Day brainstorm : a pregnancy test , but instead of a little , blue line , there 's a little blue Barney going like this .

 Barney , Not A Father 's Day is lame .
 It 's a holiday for losers .
 What are you ... talking about ?
 That 's a great group of bros .


 - It 's the Cheerleader Effect .
 - No , Ted . That only works for chicks .
 Take a good look at each one of those guys individually .

 These geniuses are not childless by choice , my friend . - Good night , Barney . - Good night .

 Sock .
 - Do I smell chocolate chip pancakes ?
 - No , you smell " Chocolate chip
 I 'm sorry I was such a drunk idiot " pancakes . Is there any " Wish I hadn 't puked on your shirt " bacon ?
 There sure is .
 Baby ...
 I 'm so sorry about last night .
 I know I was a mess .
 I just started freaking out about whether we 're ready to be parents .
 But you took such good care of me .
 I know you 're gonna be - a great dad .
 - I don 't want to be a dad right now .
 What ?
 Last night , it was just ... between balancing work and drunk Baby Lily , it was too much .
 I 'm just getting started at this job , I 'm working such long hours , I mean ...
 Look , I love you .
 And I absolutely want to have kids someday .
 I just ... I want to be ready for it .
 Me , too .

 Whenever we are ready ,
 I know you 're going to be amazing .
 You , too .
 Do you want to go have completely protected sex right now ?
 I do . Do you want to finish your bacon first ?

 You are the perfect woman .
