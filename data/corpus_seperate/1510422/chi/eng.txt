 Ted ?
 Ted ?
 Jen ?
 Jen ?
 It 's nice to meet you .

 It 's nice to meet you , too .

 Do you want to ... ?
 Yeah .



 Guess who just got four tickets
 Why ?
 No , I said , " Guess who ? "
 I heard you .
 Yeah , um , isn 't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship ? What ?
 No , what are you talking about ? It can be our first double date as couples ! And plus , it sounds awesome !
 Is the original Chewbacca going to be there ?
 Peter Mayhew , in the fur .
 Who 's with me ?
 Hey , do you think they 'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there ?
 I mean , even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful .
 We 're not going to the " Origins of Chewbacca " exhibit , Marshall . It 's in Houston this year .
 Everyone knows that .
 I just wanted to get rid of the girls . Where are you taking me , Barney ?

 Wait a second .
 The " Origins of Chewbacca " exhibit 's in Montreal this year . Everyone knows that .
 Where are you taking me ?
 My guy in the DA 's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection . But we 're still stopping for chili dogs first .
 Stop the cab .
 Where are you taking me ?
 ( techno dance music playing )
 Barney , why are we here ?
 Marshall , now that Robin and I are together ,
 I 've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily . Thanks , man .
 You 're a terrible couple .
 Lily has taken all the man out of you .
 I used to think that 's just every relationship .
 But what I 've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time .
 Okay , right . So , if Robin knew that you were here , she would be completely fine with it ? Are you kidding ?
 She 'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10 : 30 Jell- O show .
 BT- Dub , I called ahead -- it 's lime .
 So , Jen , what do you do ?
 I 'm between jobs -- banking crisis .
 I 'm between jobs -- Internet bubble burst .
 Makes me realize I should go into something more stable ... like banking . So what about you ?
 I 'm an architect .
 Hopefully , one day ,
 I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that is Manhattan 's skyline . I teach aritecture .
 Get 50 % off
 Married ! What is wrong with you ?
 You 're just looking .
 It 's like fantasizing about other women . It 's harmless .
 What .
 Don 't tell me you don 't fantasize about other women . I do !
 It 's just not that easy .
 False .
 I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck 's mudflaps . Took me less than a mile .
 Not everyone is you , okay , Barney ?
 Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that ...

 ( hiccups )
 Bad news .
 Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that 's apparently medical illegitimate . What ? !
 How could this be ? !
 Beats me , but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have .
 It 's time , baby .
 I will never love again .
 No , Marshall , you must .
 And after an appropriate number of years , you should find someone else .
 Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time .
 And plow her like a cornfield .
 And so , Marshall , to honor Lily , you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield .

 Delivery for Marshall Eriksen .
 Where do I sign ?

 And then watch out , because it is on !
 That is the saddest thing I 've ever heard .
 Dude , Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies . It 's all I know , okay ?
 I can 't , I can 't help it . I accept your invitation .
 Marshall Eriksen , from this day forward ,
 I will be the wingman of your mind .
 Now , focus on the next dancer . Put Lily completely out of your mind .
 Gentlemen , say hello J- J- J- Jasmine .

 Barney ?
 Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like ... ?
 Ted , we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily ! Yeah , I can 't talk right now .
 I 'm speechless , too . Everything 's as perky as we 've always imagined !
 Stop looking at her .
 Uh , look , I got to go .
 Take a picture . Oh , I will .
 But first , I 'm going to make Marshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife 's tatas .
 I 'll kill you !
 Sorry about that . So , any thoughts on food ?
 Yeah , do you wanna share the oysters ? I would love to share the oysters .
 Good .
 'Cause if you didn 't ... ... that would be mighty shellfish .
 Wow , that 's bad . That 's why it 's funny !

 We 've been on this date before .
 We 've been on this exact blind date before . In this exact same restaurant .
 Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I don 't think that blind date went too well .
 Me neither . I remember thinking that you were a little snobby .
 Wait , you ...
 You dress ur cats up in weird costumes . They 're not weird . See , you 're being snobby again .
 Oh , my God . Do you realize what this means ?
 Since our first date , we 've done a complete lap of all the single people in New York only to end up back here , with each other .
 Whoa . We 're going to die alone , aren 't we ?
 Well , you 've got your cats . ( chuckles )
 This is insane .
 Wait , I got to ask . Why did you think I was snobby ?
 Okay ... yeah , we were sitting over there ... ( laughs )
 Wait ...
 Main Lobster .
 They spelled " Maine " without the " e . " Good to know we 're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters , right ?
 Tonight , the role of pound- and- a- half lobster will be played by ...
 I get it , Ted .
 Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty .
 Huh . I had no idea .
 Okay , well , what about me ?
 Aside from the cats , how did I come across ?
 That 's right -- the check .
 The check came and , of course , I was going to pay , but you didn 't do the check dance .
 ( lilting orchestral melody plays )
 Guys want to wave the girl off and , you know , look like a big shot .
 Huh . I had no idea . This is good .
 We 're learning stuff . You know what we should do ?
 We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates .
 ' Cause let 's be honest -- we are scaring people off , Jen .
 We really are . Okay , I 'm in .
 Great . Where 'd we go next ? I think we went to MacLaren 's .
 Okay .

 Hey , I didn 't really talk about my cats that much , did I ? And then , there 's Tabby- gail Adams , the jester of the group .
 Tone down the kitty talk .
 Check . You will not believe who we saw tonight .
 Dude , um ... We saw the third doppelganger !
 ( gasps )


 Hey , hey , hey , hey !





 Ladies , meet Stripper Lily .
 Oh ! Okay .
 Yeah , I couldn 't get her face in it .
 But she looks just like you . So you went to a strip club ?
 Busted .
 And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me ?
 Okay , babe , look , before you get mad , let me ...
 Awesome ! I bet the guys were going crazy .
 Oh , I bet they wanted to touch her so bad .
 But all you can do is look , unless you go into the back room , but honey , you got to pay for that .
 So ... Strip club .
 Marshall made me go .
 All right , so what did I do wrong next ?
 Let me have it . I 'here to learn .
 Well , I kept telling you I was cold , but you didn 't offer me your jacket . It 's a little brisk out tonight , huh ?
 Not really . Really ?
 I can 't feel my fingers . I 'm pretty impervious to stuff like that .
 I couldn 't admit I was cold .
 I didn 't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex- boyfriend who you wouldn 't stop talking about .
 After a day of fighting fires ,
 Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his ' 68 Camo . That or bare- knuck boxing , which he learned in the Marine Corps .
 I had an aunt in the Coast Guard .
 Okay , so no talking about the ex .
 Not even about his shockingly small wiener ?
 See ? Why didn 't you lead off with that ?
 Was there a shower on stage ?
 Sometimes there 's a shower on stage .
 I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas .
 See , Marshall ?
 We got to have a bros ' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it . I 'm not cool with it .
 Because they understand that it 's healthy for us to do that from time to time .
 It 's disgusting . Because it 's harmless .
 Did one of your whores tell you that ?
 And , Lil , Marshall shouldn 't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy .
 Trouble ? What trouble ? It 's , no , it 's nothing .
 Marshall , tell her . We 're all friends here .
 No , we 're not .
 Sometimes I think about other women . Okay , it happens
 But even when I do , I feel so guilty that I- I have to imagine you ... passing away first ,
 You 're ... you 're just my life , baby .
 And I love you . You kill me first ? !
 I mean , fantasize about other girls all you want , but could you maybe not murder me ? !
 Murder ? ! No ! I , baby- no .
 You develop a chronic illness ! I spare no expense for your care !
 We 're , like , this close to a cure . Remember ? Oh , yeah !
 I do remember .
 We went in here for a drink with your friends . Who I loved ...
 Or hated , depending on whether you 're still friends with them . You loved them .
 They 're family , Ted .
 Let 's go in and see what they remember .
 And they are my best friends , so don 't be surprised if they suddenly " can 't think" of anything I do wrong .
 Did he juggle ?
 Bad puns ?
 Mmm .
 Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check
 Oh , let 's not forget the menu typo gold mine .
 Keep pannin ' that river , buddy . Well , it is a lot cheaper than buying a coom .
 Oh !
 Actually you know what it was ?
 I remember him coming across as kind of a player . Me ?
 Ted ? Ted ? Yeah .
 We were all sitting over there ...
 And here 's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains .
 You got the Joker , the Riddler , Mr. Freeze ...
 Wh about Cat Woman ?
 Yeah , that would 've been good .
 Psst ! Ted !
 Nice .
 Wait , wait , wait , no , no , no !
 I member that . Psst , Ted .

 Nice .
 We were checking out Moustache Marshall . Ah . Ah .
 Gosh , I thought you were such a jerk .
 I 'm so sorry . Yeah , well , it 's nice to know " past me " wasn 't a total jackass , huh ?
 " Present you " isn 't so bad , either .
 Thank you very much .
 You got it .
 Yes . Oh , yeah !
 I remember this . ... and there 's the Chrysler Building .
 And the Empire State Building .
 And at 12 : 00 , a rotund couple going at it against the glass .
 Aww ... That 's kind of sweet .
 Oh , look . Snack break .
 Good for them .
 Letting a guy eat pizza off your back , that 's love .
 So , um ...
 I know this wasn 't the best first date of all time , but , uh , I 'm glad we stuck it out .
 Me , too .

 That was really great .
 Wh ...
 What went wrong ? I remember now .

 Wow .
 Yeah .
 So would you maybe , um ... want to go out again ? Yeah , I , I would . Will you call me ?
 Absolutely . Promise ?
 Promise .
 I have been so busy .
 Good night , Ted .

 Hello ?
 Jen , I sorry .
 Look , I know I 'm seven years late with this call , but I was an idiot back then .
 You saw the goatee .
 The truth is ,
 I had a great time tonight , and I 'd love to see you again .
 Ted , there are two kinds of guys .
 The guys that you want to call you , who don 't ; and the guys you don 't want to call you , who always do .
 And somehow , right now , you 're both .
 Baby ...
 You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty ,
 I wish that I could , but I 've been doing this for so long ,
 I 'm all confused about death and sex . It 's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery , I 'm sportin ' a partial .
 All right , we got to fix this .
 Okay , when
 Stripper Lily gets out here , you have my permission to fantasize about her .
 And since she 's basically me , maybe you won 't feel guilty . Thanks , baby .
 I 'm- I 'm so lucky I have you . And stripper you .
 Bring out Stripper Lily !
 You know , I don 't come here that much .
 Hey , Barney .
 He 's the usual and I 'll send over the other usual as soon as she 's done stretching .
 Hmm ... Thank you , kindly stranger .
 Ladies and gentlemen ...
 Oh , hey , Barney . Didn 't see you come in .
 I 'll load up some AC/ DC for you , buddy .
 Ladies and gentlemen , please put your hands together for Jasmine .

 I am hot !
 Ye .
 Oh , crawl for it , stripper me . I is awesome .
 Baby , can I get another hundred ? That was a hundred ? Wow , she crawls fast .

 Look , Jen , I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted , but that guy 's a lost cause .
 He 's 24 .
 He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp .
 And he has no idea what a great girl he 's missing out on . But I 've learned a lot since then .
 I 've learned a lot tonight .
 The only thing that we 've learned is that , seven years ago , it was mistake for us to go out .
 And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight . No , it wasn 't .
 I had a great time tonight .
 And seven years ago , if you think about it , we didn 't miss by that much .
 If a couple things had gone a little bit differently ... who knows what would have happened ?









 Wow .
 Wow .
 You are the best .
 My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn 't care less . I do care , Barney .
 Look , we 're dating now , okay ? That changes things .
 We have to have a serious talk about this . Just the best . Hey .
 Girlfriend trouble ?
 I wish I could help , but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double .
 So if you need me , I 'll be getting grinded like some pepper , in the Champagne room .
 Just the best .
 ... now what ?
 I just remembered why I didn 't call you .
 Why ?
 I can 't believe I 'm gonna screw this up again , but , um ...
 I like finding typos in menus .
 What ?
 And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth ...
 I 'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes .
 Now that you mention it ... I 'm never going to stop talking about my cats .
 They 're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day .
 Shouldn 't we hold out for the person who doesn 't just tolerate our little quirks , but actually kind of likes them ?
 Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other , seven years from now ?
 Oh , dear God , I hope that don 't happen .
 Well ... good luck out there , Jen .
 You too , Ted .
 You 'll find your shellfish lady .

 And I swear , it was only , like , 30 % pity .

 Hey , Lil .
 Looks like , uh , Jasmine 's having a hard time getting out of those boots .
 What did you say , buddy ? Lily ?
 Who ? Oh , yes ...
 I am this Lily . We married long time .
 May I have monies for shopping ?
 Lily ! www . addic7ed . com
