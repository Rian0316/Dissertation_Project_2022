 Max , thanks for agreeing to get in the spirit and do holiday cupcakes .
 So much better than last year when you go so drunk you turned the 12 days of Christmas into the 12 steps of Christmas .
 Yeah , well , I finally gave in .
 Christmas is like herpes .
 No matter what you do , it 's gonna flare up once a year .
 Oh , you made Feliz Navidad cupcake .
 I 'm muy proud of you .
 And I think we 're going to make muy mucho moolah when Manuel comes manana .
 You 're the only person I know who seems whiter speaking Spanish .
 Feliz Navidad for our Spanish speaking friends .
 And for kids raised like me , Feliz " He 's- not- your- dad . "
 And then , " Joy To The World " for the normals , and for the hipsters , " Joint To The World . "
 For the kids , " Frosty The Snowman . "
 And for you , " Frosty With No Man . "
 Well , I didn 't see Jack Frost nipping at your nips either .
 Oh , here , this one 's my favorite ,
 " Santa Claus Is Coming " --
 Max , stop right there .
 No , that was it .
 He 's coming .



 Earl , change please .
 " Earl , change please . "
 A phrase I heard from both my ex- wives .
 Wow , you have more Christmas cards than Oscar Pistorius had excuses .
 What can I say , Max ?
 I spread a lot of goodwill .
 It 's also where I get all of my shirts .
 Here you go .
 Have a nice holiday .
 My two kids love this time of year .
 And next Christmas , there will be three .
 It 's a boy .
 My husband was so happy when I called him in Afghanistan .
 Man , this time of year people are easier than a fat girl in a tube top .
 Oh , great .
 We can use this money to order more of our cupcake T- shirts .
 No , we are using that to buy people Christmas gifts .
 I was really looking forward to giving someone something that wouldn 't require the follow- up penicillin shot .
 We need more shirts .
 These are really selling .
 The guy at table four said it 's the perfect gift for a girl you 're not in love with , just strictly banging .
 He bought three .
 I happen to know for a fact that everyone here 's getting us stuff .
 Han came in with a small package today and also he was carrying a gift bag .
 We 'll find some money for the gifts .
 People aren 't expecting anything big .
 Happy holidays .
 People just got the nothing big they were expecting .
 Gather , please .
 I have a very special gift for all my diner employees .
 Health insurance ?
 Come on , it 's Christmastime , not crazy time .
 It 's art .
 It 's a one of a kind silk screen .
 I did it by hand .
 I figured that 's how you always have to do it .
 Han , it 's the diner .
 This is amazing .
 Open the door .
 I put something behind it that reminds me of each of you .
 Mine has Sophie .
 Mine has a saxophone .
 Mine has a cupcake .
 Mine has a chainsaw .
 Hey , everybody !
 Holiday shopping tip :
 Fill a Starbucks cup with vodka .
 Also good for waitressing .
 Sophie , were you Christmas shopping ?
 Oh , you know I was !
 Power strips !
 Oh good .
 You got surge protectors .
 Wow , that 's the first time protection 's ever been used in your apartment .
 Well , my Christmas village needs 75, 000 watts .
 And that 's just to work my candy cane helicopter .
 Sophie 's been so busy with the Polish Society Decorating Contest .
 We haven 't had sex in days .
 Well , I got to beat my nemesis , Felka Bobenski .
 She wins every year .
 She 's like the Modern Family of Christmas decorations
 You know who 's having a blue Christmas this year ?
 My balls .
 I love this city at the holidays .
 Yeah , the urine 's all frozen so you can 't really smell it .
 Manhattan is the best place to buy quality Christmas gifts .
 We have 40 bucks .
 Now , where are those duffel bags full of stolen electronics sold for half the price by Nairobi refugees ?
 Well , we better find them soon or I 'm going to give up and go to Radio Shack
 like everyone else who goes to Radio Shack .
 Oh my God , Max .
 My childhood bank .
 You had a childhood bank ?
 I didn 't even have a childhood .
 Come on , let 's go .
 I stop in every few months to get caught on the security cameras , so people will think I 'm still in the mix .
 Trying to get caught on security cameras ?
 Whoa , we are different .
 Yeah , we 'll just go in and while we 're in here , well , I don 't know , ask for a business loan .
 We are not getting a business loan !
 You tricked me into coming to the city .
 At least knock me out and put me in the trunk like a person .
 Okay , I hear you .
 No loan .
 But can we at least go in there so I can get a hit off some vault fumes and a complimentary Christmas cocoa ?
 Yeah , I want one too .
 It 's so cold out here my bra is suing my nipples for assault .
 I 'd say we ask for $15, 000 .
 So close I almost smelled a 100 .
 What is with you ?
 If I wanted you to keep lying to me ,
 I 'd date you .
 Max , we need more capital so we can buy our shirts in bulk , and then , if we work even harder , we can double our profit .

 Okay , we won 't pass even the credit check .
 According to my Social Security number ,
 I died in a boat explosion years ago .
 This is the time to apply .
 Bankers have more guilt at Christmastime because of It 's A Wonderful Life .
 And also 'cause they 're Jewish .
 I 'm the one with the business degree , and you have to trust me on this .
 You know what ?
 You 're right .
 You 're the business genius .
 What do I know ?
 Let 's go get that loan .
 Thank you !
 Yeah , I should have known that was too good to be true .
 Max , come on .
 The bank 's there .
 Our shirt 's in here .
 Let 's just go in , show them , and apply for that loan .
 - Please !
 - No .
 - Please !
 - No .
 - Please !
 - No .
 And that right there was a little something called " us asking for a bank loan . "
 Now let 's go .
 I 'm not leaving here until you tell me what the underlying issue is .
 I 'm not in love with you anymore .
 Max , be serious .
 This whole T- shirt was your idea .
 What 's the real problem ?
 That 's the problem .
 Those shirts were my idea and nothing that comes from me is worth $15, 000 .
 Aside from that baby I sold on E- baby .
 Max , I know these T- shirts are a money- maker .
 Oh , I have a money- maker and that 's not it .
 I can prove it .
 Look , this is Rodney , my childhood over- priced clothing store .
 If I had known we were going on the childhood tour today ,
 I would have worn more comfortable shoes and stayed home .
 See the shirt on the mannequin ?
 At least $200 .
 And there 's no reason we can 't sell ours for just as much .
 I 'll show you .
 Follow me .
 Oh , okay , I will .
 But not on Instagram ,
 ' cause you 're out of control .
 This place is fancy and I 've been to the new Port Authority in Newark .
 Just trust me , okay ?
 You need to jump on those Wang pumps or like Ben Affleck , they will be " Gone , girl . "

 Let me do the talking .
 I speak his language .
 And what language is that ?
 Portu- gays ?
 Hello , ladies .
 Welcome to Rodney .
 I 'm Barry .
 Doing a little holiday shopping ?
 We 're not allowed to say Christmas .
 As a matter of fact , we 're doing a little holiday selling .
 Oh , you 're " selling . "
 Got it .
 Molly ?
 Coke ?
 Not that I 'm interested .
 I 've been clean since Fire Island 2010 .
 And 2012 .
 It must be hard to not be high and be you .
 Because it 's hard for me to just be near you and not be high .
 Yeah , you get it , girl .
 Actually , we wanted to see if you 'd be interested in selling one of our fabulous graphic t- shirts .
 Oh , n- n- n- n- n- n- n- n- n- n -- all sorts of " no " , Okay ?
 As much as I love a fez , a caftan , and a teenage boy , this isn 't Morocco .
 That 's a really long and boring version of " No . "
 It 's like you just did " No !
 The One Woman Show . "
 Here 's our T- shirt --
 Look .
 I 'll tell you two what I said to a young Marc Jacobs .
 Stop offering , I 'm off the junk .
 Merry Holiday .
 I 'll show Mary a holiday .
 Our shirts are just as good as these .
 He just needs to see it .
 Here , hold this .
 What are you ?
 American Psycho ?
 As soon as someone says " No " to you , you start dismembering women .
 I can 't get her shirt off .
 Tell her she can spend the night and you 'll buy her a waffle in the morning .
 Okay , hand me our shirt .
 I think this is gonna be big for us .
 You also think Michael Buble rocks .
 Oh , I have to hurry .
 Barry is coming .
 Barry is coming .
 I 'm guessing mostly with strangers .
 Seriously ?
 Seriously ?
 Ser- I- ous- ly ?
 So cute .
 And look on the back , " Cream Filled . "
 Funny .
 People will think I have a personality .
 Barry , put this with my other stuff .
 How much ?
 300 .
 Forget the sober story .
 That guy is high .
 I 'll take ten .
 They 'll make great Hanukkah gifts for my friends who don 't hate their arms .
 All our shirts just got bought by a rich dead lady .
 I 'll need 30 more by Friday .
 Yes , I 'm still holding .
 I need to place a rush t- shirt order .
 No , no , no , no , no .
 Don 't put me on hold again .
 I 've been through seven rounds of
 Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer .
 And she just got run over again .
 Now that we have all this crazy gay t- shirt money ,
 I think we should up the prices on these gifts .
 So we agree , we 're getting Earl a car .
 Sophie is getting the country house with the lake she 's always wanted .
 Max , Rodney is selling our shirts for 300 , but we only get 25 of that .
 And you can 't buy a house for $750 .
 It 's not Detroit .
 Yes , hi , hi , hi .
 Finally a person .
 I need 50 T- shirts by Friday .
 But your business card says you guarantee next- day delivery .
 Oh , you can 't " Guarantee " that guarantee ?
 Okay , now Oleg .
 What do you get a man who has nothing , but shows you everything ?
 What do you mean " Is there anything else you can help me with ? " when did you help me at all ?
 And I 'm beginning to think if Grandma works for you , she didn 't get run over by that reindeer , she threw herself under a sleigh .
 So , Sophie 's getting a Snapple .
 Like last year .
 Max , we can 't give up .
 We can do them ourselves .
 We just need someone else to do them .
 Come on , let 's go .
 There are customers who have been here since Robin Thicke was relevant .
 There are customers who have been here
 Wait a minute , Han .
 You silk- screened all those beautiful cards .
 You have an artistic side .
 Yeah , but no backside .
 And a front side that shouldn 't be allowed outside .
 Why is this taking so long ?
 You did all those Christmas cards .
 Aren 't small creatures supposed to be fast ?
 Truth be told , those were supposed to be ready last year .
 But , what was the rush ?
 You two weren 't going anywhere .
 Han , just a simple " Yes " or " No " .
 No judgment .
 Have you had sex with this machine ?
 The only thing worse than you two working for me is me working for you .
 You haven 't even given me water .
 Water is for closers .
 By " closers , " I mean people who actually make clothes .
 Who 's that ?
 Han , did you call Child Protective Service on us ?
 ' Cause those bruises could be from anyone .
 Han , you 've only made one shirt in two hours .
 Do you want one Citizen Kane or 30 Here Comes the Booms ?
 And it 's a masterpiece .
 Guys , I need your help .
 Sophie 's right behind me and needs some cheering up .
 I haven 't seen her this depressed since she woke up mid- coitus last night .
 Hi .
 Hi .
 Hi , girls .
 Merry Christmas .
 Quick question : if I were to turn on that oven and close all the windows , would I die ?
 Nope .
 Otherwise I wouldn 't be standing here next to Kim Jong- Only- Done- One .
 Sophie , what 's the problem ?
 Tell Han while he gets back to work .
 And Han , pick up the pace or I 'm going to start the pinching again .
 I 'm gonna lose the Christmas decorating contest .
 Oh , I have nothing to live for .
 Oh , Caroline , this is probably how you feel every day .
 Sophie 's competition made a live- action
 North Pole workshop in front of her house .
 Well , all I got upstairs is a light- up nativity and $25, 000 worth of Target Christmas decorations .
 She blew five fuses last night .
 I never thought I 'd be jealous of a fuse .
 Sophie , we really can 't get into this now .
 We are way behind with these T- shirts .
 And these T- shirts are a once in a lifetime chance for us to go to a new place with our business .
 Oh yeah , I hear you , girls .
 I mean , what am I doing here sitting worrying about some silly contest ?
 It 's Christmas .
 Come on everybody .
 We should all be helping the girls .
 Really ?
 That would be so amazing .
 Sure !
 And you wouldn 't even have to pay me back by letting me use your barn and your horse tomorrow night for a live nativity scene , which you would all have to be in .
 Or something like that .
 I think we just had a seasonal shake- down .
 Han 's doing the last one .
 We 're gonna make it .
 I can 't believe you 're in such a good mood with that beard .
 Last week when you found those two chin hairs , you weren 't so chipper .
 I 'm just so happy I have new clothes .
 Okay , final shirt .
 Then I get you two out of my angel hair .
 Han , you know , if it weren 't for you , we would have never gotten this done .
 You really are a little angel .
 But I 'm still surprised you weren 't cast as the baby .
 Yeah , you are .
 Oh , I was asked , but I declined .
 I spent ten year getting out of diapers .
 I 'm not getting back in .
 Han , for your Christmas gift ,
 I 'll pretend I never heard that .
 Places everybody .
 The judges are coming .
 I 'm ready .
 Joseph 's ready .
 Cabbage Patch Christ is ready .
 Come on !
 What 's with the cleavage ?
 I know .
 She 's like the Not- So- Virgin Mary .
 Angel , Shepherd , Lady with the beard , come on , get in the stable .
 Stable ?
 The way we look it should be an " Unstable . "
 Everybody ready ?
 I 'm going to open the barn door .
 Yeah , I think your barn door 's already a little open .
 Okay now , who am I again ?
 Voltron ?
 I 'm not gonna lie .
 One of the wise men might have smoked some " Myrrh- ijuana . "
 That was a very nice Christmas gift , Max .
 Thanks , Earl .
 By the way , Sophie , the barn and us dressed like idiots ?
 That 's your Christmas gift .
 Oh , and hey , bang Oleg later .
 Oleg , that 's your gift .
 How did you know ?
 Before they come in , let 's just take a moment to look around and really let in the true spirit of Christmas .
 I don 't remember writing you a monologue .
 Shut up !
 Get your ass over by the horse .
 Come on , Han .
 Hit the music .
 All right , everybody ,
 look holy .
 Best I can do is my underwear .
 Oh , crap !
 Oh , that 's right , Felka .
 I 'm the freakin ' mother of God .
 We won !
 I 'm so happy we won .
 We won !
 We Won !
 Okay , show 's over .
 Dump the kid , I 'll be upstairs .
 Max , take care of Cabbage Patch Christ .
 Here , Han .
 You got a buddy your own size .
 Thank you so much , Barry .
 And remember , I want 50 more shirts after the first of the year when I 'm back from rehab .
 ' Cause ladies , I am planning a very white Christmas .
 Max , this is amazing !
 Do you know what just happened in there ?
 Yeah , I stole some dope- ass fingerless gloves .
 We 're in business with them now .
 You have to bring those back .
 I got them for you .
 Okay .
 This is like a Christmas miracle .
 Our shirts are being sold in the most exclusive bitchy boutique in Manhattan and they want more , lots more .
 Hey , let 's go into your childhood bank .
 I need to take an adult pee .
 Okay , but this isn 't home , so remember , put the seat down when you 're done .
 And while we 're in there , we can apply for that loan .
 No , no , no , no , no .
 We can 't .
 Now I 'm afraid .
 Come on , what 's the real issue here ?
 We just had this amazing success .
 And it looks like things are going our way , and if we go in there , it could all be ruined .
 You know what would ruin our lives even more ?
 If we don 't get that loan and have to spend hours with Han standing under us trying to finish those shirts .
 Well , that 's a real " Nightmare Before Christmas . "
 Let 's go .
 Good , cause I 'm starting to pee a little .
 He gave us a loan !
 Is everyone who works on the street high ?
 I can 't believe it .
 It didn 't go bad .
 I 'm getting everything I want .
 Walk on the outside of the sidewalk .
 I 'm gonna get hit by a bus .
 I mean , how could he give us a loan ?
 I didn 't even have to flash my boobs .
 Then why did you do it ?
 I don 't know .
 They were making it rain .
 I felt obliged .
 Max , do you have a dollar ?
 I don 't know .
 Do you have change for 10, 000 ?
 Yeah , here .
 For what ?
 For those less fortunate
 Anne Hathaway 's here ?
 Oh , my God .
 Look !
 Look !
 Whoa , no way !
 No way !
 Max , I have chills .
 Well , it is snowing and there 's no fingers on those gloves .
 I love these .
 I 'm sorry I didn 't get you anything .
 I 'm just not a thief .
 What do you mean you didn 't get me anything ?
 You got me everything .
 Look .
