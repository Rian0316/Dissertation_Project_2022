 Hey , Maisy . Are you having an affair with my husband ?

 Very good to be back .
 - What 's that ?
 I 'm on house arrest . It 's a condition of my bail .
 How will you work ?
 - I can 't . I can 't do anything .

 Lord , that 's Angela .
 I 'm afraid you 're mistaken .
 My wife 's name was Mary Alice .
 I 'm such an idiot ! And you 're such a liar !
 Oh , and apparently a killer !


 Ida !
 Ida Greenberg , that is not your paper !
 Throw me a 20 , and I 'll hook you up with free porn .

 Get the hell out of my life !

 Does your husband know how many men pay for the privilege of sleeping in this bed ?
 There 's not a lot of sleeping going on .
 Not if I 'm doing my job right .
 So , how do you want to get started ?
 With these . Well ! That 's gonna cost you extra .
 Maisy Gibbons , you 're under arrest for solicitation .
 What ? Please don 't place your hands on the bed .
 I 'm sorry , I have to ask you to leave .
 Now . Hey ! Get off me !
 This is entrapment !
 - Right . You all are making a gigantic mistake .
 Yeah . Hey fellows , there 's one for your memoirs .
 Hey ! Come on , lady ! - No !
 Don 't you touch me !
 Get your hands off me !
 - Take it easy , Ms Gibbons .



 Take it easy now .
 - Don 't you put me in here !

 Tish ? Hey . You are not going to believe this .
 Maisy Gibbons was arrested .
 - You cannot be serious .
 Did you hear about Maisy ?
 Maisy Gibbons running in handcuffs ?
 I 'd have killed to see that ! Stay put , I 'll be right back .
 Ladies , please calm down now .
 This is just a precaution .
 If you 'll just take a flier , we can work together --
 Hey guys .
 What 's going on ?
 Oh , there 's been an outbreak of head lice .
 Head lice ?
 These fliers detail all important information concerning the situation , including the recommended delousing combs .
 Delousing ? Did they have to make it sound so disgusting ?
 Does anybody know where it started ?
 I 'm sorry , that 's confidential .
 Barcliffe maintains a strict " no blame " policy .
 Guys , over here !
 Parents have a right to know who brought this into our school !
 Please calm down , Ma 'am .
 Our position is there 's nothing to be gained by pointing fingers .
 To identify the child who initiated the outbreak might result in him/ her being subjected to ridicule .
 I -- excuse me .
 If you 'll just take a flier --
 Stop scratching !
 Stop !
 Let 's go ! Hey ! Stop scratching !
 See you later .
 - Bye !
 What the hell --
 Gabrielle ! - What ?
 Gabrielle ! I think we got a problem here . I can 't hear you .
 - I think we got a problem .
 The water 's backing up here .
 - What ?
 Is that sewage ? Yeah , that 's sewage .
 Mike , the suspense is killing us .
 Why don 't you tell us the bad news .
 Your outtake pipe is completely corroded . That 's why it collapsed .
 We 'll have to tear it out , re- pipe the whole system .
 And how much will this cost ?
 I 'll do it at cost , but you 're still looking at 6- 7 grand minimum .
 OK -- Well , we 'll let you know .
 If money is an issue -- Oh , no , no . It 's not the money .
 It 's just -- We were trying to prioritize some little things we need to do around the house .
 And do you consider sewage backing up in the house a priority ?
 It 's definitely on the shortlist .
 Right .
 I was surprised you called me .
 - Why ?
 Well , ever since my arrest nobody here wants to have to do with me .
 Innocent until proven guilty , my man .
 I hope he 's more innocent than you .
 Hey , it 's Lynette . I know you 're down about Mike , but you gotta come to poker .
 It 'll be worth it .
 I got dirt on Maisy Gibbons . Hey Susan , it 's me .
 I really wish you 'd return my calls .
 We need to talk .
 I know I messed things up --
 You OK ?
 Hi .
 I can stay home if you want .
 No .
 I know how much you were looking forward to this weekend with your dad .
 I 'm fine .
 You don 't look fine . Well -- a little sad .
 Mike and I were just a fling .
 And not even a full fling .
 Sort of a borderline fling .
 Mom , anyone can see how much you loved him .
 I also loved junk food , and I gave that up and survived .
 There 's your father .
 Go have fun . Last chance .
 You sure ?
 - I 'm sure .
 Now go !
 You 'll find someone else , Mom .
 Someone great .
 I know .
 What 's wrong , Rex ?
 Didn 't you enjoy your golf game with Dr Wallace ?
 I didn 't play . Still feeling sluggish .
 Still ? Did you talk to him about that ?
 Of course . He doesn 't understand why the medication isn 't working .
 He asked me to come for a checkup tomorrow .
 Tish is making her round .
 She must have some juicy new anecdote .
 Get here over here .
 I could use a funny story today .
 Tish !
 Tish ! I can tell by that look on your face you 've got something good .
 Come on , don 't be selfish !
 First off -- you 're not friends with Maisy Gibbons , are you ?
 No . Thank god , because this is too good :
 Maisy was arrested .
 While Harold was at work , she was having sex with men in her house for money .
 Can you imagine ?
 No , I can 't . That 's not even the best part .
 Word is , she had a little black book with all her clients ' names .
 So -- you think that 'll get out ? Of course . These things always do .
 Nancy , wait up .
 I can 't wait till I tell you this --
 You heard your funny story , Rex .
 Why aren 't you laughing ?

 I 'll get it .
 Hello ?
 Hi Tammy .
 - Can we see one of the bugs ?
 Yeah , here . See ? It 's this little white thing .
 It looks like a sesame seed .
 It 's cool .
 There 's lots more where that came from .
 I 'm so sorry .
 You must be so disappointed .
 But we 'll get all the boys together once Topher is back on his feet .
 What did Tammy want ?
 She 's cancelling Topher 's birthday party on Sunday .
 He 's come down with the measles .
 Measles , huh ? - Yeah . What ?
 Tammy Brandon spent a fortune on Topher 's birthday .
 She 'd call in specialists from Switzerland before she 'd let it be cancelled .
 Why would Tammy lie to us ? Because she saw Porter scratching his head .
 They all did . Now word 's getting around .
 Why is everything a conspiracy theory with you ?
 Lots of kids get lice .
 Not a big deal . Well , it is for the rich B- I- T- C- H- es at Barcliffe Academy .
 It 's been one day , and they were disinvited to a birthday party .
 Rumours start flying , these boys can kiss camp- outs and pool parties goodbye .
 Uh- oh .
 - Not so cool now , huh ?
 It 's all here .
 Appraisal , title search , escrow documents .
 I 'm sorry I changed my mind , but this isn 't a good time to sell the house .
 Zack 's going through a lot . He wants to finish high school before we 're moving .
 Forget this part of the business .
 I expect to get screwed over . Now where is your house key ?
 I must have left it at home .
 I 'll bring it by tonight .
 No one will be here .
 Zack 's on a school trip , and I 'm going to Mt Pleasant on business today .
 Just drop it by tomorrow .
 Or , I could just keep it .
 What ?
 It 's a joke , Paul .
 I know your wife 's dead and all , but -- it 's been six months !
 Lighten up !
 Hello .
 - Felicia .
 Oh , hi , Felicia .
 Edie , I found this in my sister 's things .
 It has your name on it .
 Aw , my necklace !
 I 've lent this to Martha 3 months ago .
 She said it went down the drain !
 I miss how we used to steal things from one another .
 So Felicia , I heard they have a suspect in your sister 's murder ?
 Mike Delfino ?
 Oh , he didn 't kill her .
 But they found her jewelry in his garage .
 But his fingerprints were not on the evidence .
 That just means he wore gloves .
 So he 's smart enough to use gloves , but he leaves her blood- spattered jewelry lying around for anyone to find ?
 Please ! Is that what you do if you kill someone ?
 I don 't know what goes through the mind of a murderer .
 I 'm just saying I wouldn 't trust him if I were you .
 Evie . That is lovely .
 Is it an antique ?
 Yeah , I think so .
 I know a story you would love . It specializes in antique jewelry .
 It 's in Salt Lake City . Have you ever been there ?
 No , I try to steer clear of Utah .
 It 's a little too -- conservative for me .
 Too bad .
 Have you ever been , Paul ?
 No .
 It 's lovely . I used to live there .
 When I was a nurse . You should definitely go sometime .
 Bye .


 Sorry .
 That 's OK . I was just about to give a Maisy Gibbons update .
 Guys , we should be ashamed for reveling in that woman 's misery .
 That being said , Edie , please continue .
 Well .
 I hear from a very reliable source that Maisy will cut a deal with the prosecution .
 Apparently , she has some high- profile johns and the DA is looking for a second term .
 I don 't get it .
 I don 't get who would pay Maisy for sex .
 Obviously someone who is not getting it at home .
 The upshot is : Maisy will turn over her little black book with all her clients ' names .
 Really ?
 Yep .
 Can you imagine the fallout when this goes public ?
 Blood on the walls .
 I 'm all in .
 - I 'll call .


 Bree ? - What just happened ?
 Stakes were raised .
 - Yes , yes , they were ...
 I 've called .

 I can 't believe how lucky you were today .
 - Luck had nothing to do with it .
 I had crappy cards , I was bluffing the entire time .
 - Really ?
 Wow , you 're good . That 's the only nice thing I could say about my first husband : he told me how to bluff .

 He played poker ?
 - No , he was lousy in bed .
 I had to fake a lot of orgasms .
 You don 't have to respond .
 - Thank you .

 So where was Susan today ?
 - I 'm not sure .
 Wow , Tom must be great in bed .
 - Huh ?
 Obviously you have no idea how to bluff .
 - OK .
 She 's going through something she prefers to keep private .
 She 's upset with Mike , isn 't she ?
 Come on , I 'll find out sooner or later !
 She 's devastated about the breakup and hasn 't left the house in days .
 - Why didn 't you just tell me that ?
 Because it 's personal ; it 's something she would only want me to tell her friends .
 I 'm Susan 's friend .
 What ?
 I don 't hate her .
 Edie , if you want me to share stuff with you , start to be more supportive with Susan .
 OK . How ? - What do friends do ?
 They call ; they 're sympathetic ; they ask about the pain the other one is going through ; and then -- they listen .

 But what if you want to be supportive but just can 't stand listening to people bitch ?
 Then it 's good to know how to bluff .
 Congratulations !
 - Thank you !
 Thank you !
 It 's very exciting .
 I really think you deserve this award .
 God , I have to go to the bathroom again .
 - Go to Bree 's .
 Been to Bree 's twice today .
 - Then go to Susan 's .
 I hate Susan 's . She has all these weird scented candles . Her house reeks of apricot .
 Hose !
 What about Lynette 's ?
 - I don 't want to go to anybody 's house anymore .
 I 'm tired of knocking on doors , making up excuses why we haven 't fixed our plumbing .
 Why are you yelling at me ?
 - Because it 's your fault .
 My fault ?
 - If you hadn 't gotten yourself indicted , we would have pipes .
 I got indicted trying to make enough money to keep you happy .
 In case you hadn 't noticed , you 're a little materialistic .
 I 'm materialistic ? When the Johnsons bought their new 7 series , you traded in your car for something better .
 - Who ended up driving it ?
 I don 't have time to fight .
 I have laundry to do .

 Nurse Abigail ? - Mrs Scavo , right ? The twins ' mother ?


 I just wanted to tell you that the boys are now uh -- lice- free .
 - Good to hear .
 I just can 't figure out how it happened .
 They get a bath every night . Trust me .
 It 's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day .
 - I believe you .
 I keep thinking maybe it was the petting zoo I took them to last week .
 That llama was really iffy .
 - Mrs Scavo , it doesn 't work that way .
 Lice only spread from human to human .
 Even the cleanest kid can get it if he gets too close to the wrong kid .
 - Really ? Yes .
 So don 't be so hard on yourself , uh ? - I guess . Still I feel a little guilty .

 After all , my kids started an entire lice outbreak .
 Look , your kids didn 't start it .
 - They didn 't ?

 No ! I know that Patient Zero was another little boy . It 's his 4th time with this problem .

 Oh ! There 's a load off my mind .
 Well , thank you .
 So which kid is it ?
 - I can 't tell you .
 You know we have a " no blame " policy .
 We have to protect the children .
 You 'll understand . - Of course .
 No , I don 't . You have to give me a name .
 - Mrs Scavo ...
 Here 's the thing : acting like parents won 't assign blame is like pretending they don 't keep score at PW League games .

 It 's human nature .
 If you don 't give the mob someone to blame , they pick a scapegoat .
 I can 't let my boys be the scapegoats . - Please don 't put me in this position .
 We 've already been uninvited from a birthday party , a really big one with a bouncy house and a hot dog stand and a clown ... I 'm begging you .


 I wish I could help you .

 For god 's sake , and a magician !
 Tammy Brandon went all out .
 Tammy Brandon ?
 Topher 's mother ? - Yes .

 Now isn 't that interesting ? Have a seat .


 You gotta be kidding me .
 Hello Maisy .
 Stuff like this is why I love you .
 What brings you here ?

 I need a favor .
 - I thought as much .
 I heard there is a little black book with the name of your clients in it .
 There is .

 I was wondering if perhaps you could remove Rex 's name .

 Wow , that 's a big favor . Those muffins better be really good .
 I have some money I have been putting aside for emergencies .
 It can be yours if you just ...

 Keep my mouth shut ?
 Continue to be discreet .
 Gosh .
 I don 't know .
 I don 't think it 's asking much .
 Just remove one little name .
 But if I do it for you , I have to do it for all the other wives .
 That wouldn 't be fair , now would it ?

 Maisy ! Please ! We used to be good friends !
 Where were you when Harold lost his job a year ago ?
 Did you stop by to offer your help ?
 Did you bring a big basket of baked goods when we couldn 't even pay our bills ?
 If you did , those displays of friendship must have slipped my mind .
 Maisy , I didn 't mention your financial troubles because I thought it would embarass you .
 - Yes , but it would have been much better than silence .
 I have $14, 000 in that account .
 It can all be yours .
 I 'm not interested .

 But you do get credit for one thing : you came to visit me .
 Even if it was for an ulteriour motive .
 None of the girls in the club even bothered .
 I 've been abandoned .
 I guess that happens when you become the town whore .

 Oh sweetie , they didn 't abandon you because you 're a whore ; but because you weren 't all that nice to begin with .

 Who is it ?
 - It 's Edie ! - Edie , not now , I 'm busy .

 - I decided my life is way too complicated , so I 'm simplifying . Hi !
 - Or just come on in .
 What are you doing ?

 I 'm getting rid of the clutter .
 - Ooo .

 I was on vacation . It made sense at the time .
 OK , not to be rude , but is there a reason you 're here ?
 I feel bad about what you 're going through with Mike .
 Don 't worry , I won 't date him .
 - Doesn 't matter any more .
 Don 't get me wrong : I still have every intention of sleeping with him .
 Some mountains are meant to be climbed .
 I need to learn to keep my doors locked .

 How long have you been sitting here ?
 - I don 't know , 5 minutes , give or take 3 hours ...
 That 's it . Get up .
 Get dressed . - Why ?


 Because you 're coming with me .
 It 's time to get wasted .
 Happy hour started 45 minutes ago .
 Why would I go anywhere with you ?
 Because that 's what normal women do when they get depressed .
 They put on short skirts , they go to bars with their girlfriends , maybe have one too many , and make out with some strange man in the back of a dark alley .

 Wow .
 - Oh come on . It 'll be fun ! I swear .
 Come on !


 Why do you even care ? - I never said I cared . It 's just --
 I guess I know what it 's like to have your heart stomped on .
 OK .
 Give me a minute to change my clothes .
 And don 't forget to do something with that skanky hair .
 You 're a little scary with them .
 Aah , look at him .
 - Not my type .

 I know the pickings are slim , but isn 't there someone you 're attracted to ?
 I hate them all .
 Look at them leering at us . So damn cocky , like they know they have the upper hand .
 What ?
 We have the upper hand . Without us they have nothing .
 Maybe 15 years ago , not anymore .
 Now we 're just lonely and desperate , and they know it .
 They just sit there ?? weigh their pumps ?? .
 Waiting for us to take any crumb they 're willing to throw our way .
 I don 't want crumbs , I want Mike !
 Hi !
 I 'm gonna spending the whole night with her , so I 'll be needing a lot more of these .

 I 'm sorry .
 It 's just so hard to find a guy like Mike . I know in my heart he didn 't kill Mrs Hoover .
 OK , let 's say Mike 's a peach and he didn 't kill Martha .

 Who did ?
 - Obviously a bad guy , somebody really awful .


 Somebody like -- Paul Young .
 - Paul ?
 -- Are you serious ? I 'm telling you , he 's hiding something .
 He clams up everytime we try to ask about Mary Alice .
 And when we found out about Dina ...
 - Dina . Who 's Dina ?
 Paul and Mary Alice had a baby that died !
 You 're kidding .
 - Zach killed her .
 Holy crap , who told you that ?
 - Paul ! He said it was an accident , but
 I think that 's why Mary Alice was being blackmailed .
 Mary Alice was being blackmailed ?
 Yeah . The girls and I found a threatening note in her stuff .
 What the hell kind of street do we live on ?
 - I don 't know .
 Come to think of it : the other day Paul was talking with Felicia , and he was working overtime to make Mike sound guilty .
 See ? Shifting blame onto someone else , that 's classic criminal behavior ! I tell you , he 's up to no good .

 Zach and Paul are out of town .
 Maybe we could sneak into their house and do some snooping .
 I have the key . - Oh my god !
 Yes , we should do that !
 I was just kidding . - No , Edie , this is our chance .
 We should just go in for 10 minutes . - That 's breaking and entering .
 Martha Huber was your best friend .
 If we could find out who really killed her wouldn 't that be worth the risk ?
 Have a nice evening .
 - Thank you .
 Serena , hi ! How are you ?
 I talked to Dr Wallace today .
 - Oh ?
 He still has no idea why the medication isn 't working .
 He told me he 's thinking of running more tests .
 I told him I 'm thinking about getting a 2nd opinion .
 Rex !
 This might sound silly , but are people staring at us ?
 Yeah .
 What 's going on ?
 - I could be wrong , but I suspect that Maisy Gibbons ' client list has been released .

 you think they 're laughing at us ? - No , I think they 're laughing at you .
 I think they feel sorry for me , which is just as mortifying .
 What are we going to do ?
 Oh -- we act like nothing is happening , and when we finish eating , we will walk out of here with all the dignity we can muster .
 Please , let 's go now .
 - Oh no . I refuse to give them that satisfaction .
 Open your menu !
 Everybody 's staring ! Bree , it 's humiliating !
 You should have thought about that before you left a personal check on Maisy Gibbon 's nightstand .
 You stay here if you want to , I 'm leaving .
 Rex , if you walk out of this restaurant , I will scream .
 - I will scream about your cruelty , then I will scream about your infidelity , and to make sure it really hurts I will scream about your distasteful sexual habits . Bree ...


 If you want to know what true humiliation is , take just one step .
 So , what are you having ?
 The veal looks good .
 What are we looking for , exactly ?
 An embroidered pillow that says " I killed Martha Huber " ?
 You know , just something suspicious .
 Mmmh , smells expensive .

 Do you believe in evil , Edie ? - Of course I do .
 I work in real estate .

 I 'm serious . There 's something about this house that is so cold and creepy .

 You couldn 't tell when Mary Alice was alive .
 She brought so much warmth and light .
 Now there 's something ...
 I could just taste it . Can 't you sense it ?
 The only thing I sense is that you had too much to drink .
 Something happened in this house .
 Something so awful we can 't even imagine it .
 Oh ! Son of a bitch !
 Are you OK ?
 I just stubbed my toe .
 Oh my god , Angela !
 - Huh ?
 Angela ! That 's what Mary Alice used to call herself !
 What are you talking about ?
 We heard it on this tape that Bree stole from her therapist .
 It 's a long story , I 'll tell you later .
 We gotta put this in .

 What was that ? - I think it 's Paul .

 You said he was gone .
 - I guess I was wrong .

 Hurry !
 - I gotta get the tape !
 - Hide !
 - Paul !
 Edie !
 God , you scared me ! I 'm sorry .
 I see you made it back from Mt Pleasant . Yes .
 What are you doing here ?
 I came by to bring you your key .
 I was about to leave you a note .
 You 're returning my key at 11 . 30 at night ?
 What the hell 's going on here ?
 You 're right . We 're too old to be playing games .
 What ?
 My note was going to tell you that I -- I wasn 't kidding this afternoon .
 I really would like to keep a key to your place , to use if the -- mood strikes me .

 You 've been drinking .
 - Just enough to get up the courage to tell you how I feel about you .

 Obviously you 're uncomfortable about this .
 I 'm really sorry if I embarrassed you .

 Here 's your key .
 I 'll see you around .
 Edie , I -- I 'm not embarrassed . If anything --
 I 'm flattered .
 Susan ?
 Talk to me !
 - Mike , it 's not a good time , I 'm a little drunk and a little freaked out .
 Why didn 't you return my messages ?
 We 're broken up !
 I thought I made that pretty clear .
 Come on , can we work this out ?
 You lied to me !
 - When ?
 When did I lie to you ? The police showed me your rap sheet .
 You killed a man .
 You can 't believe I 'm some cold- blooded killer .
 Of course not , but I also didn 't believe Carl would cheat on me , or that Mary Alice would kill herself .
 Let 's face it , Mike , blind faith is not my friend .
 I was going to tell you , there just wasn 't a right moment .
 See , that 's a lie too !
 There were plenty of right moments .
 Everytime we went out for pizza , you could have said " Oh , by the way , I once killed a man . "
 Or when you said , " Hey , let 's go jogging , " you could have said ,
 " By the way , I once killed a man . "
 Everytime we went to the movies and the hero shot the bad guy , you could have turned to me and said , " By the way , I did that once . "
 You didn 't ! Do you want to hear what happened or not ?

 It doesn 't matter because I will never believe anything you say ever again .
 At least you can believe that .
 Occupied !
 Carlos , I have to go ! - Well , you 're gonna have to wait .
 Why should I have to wait ?
 It 's my porta- potty .
 What do you mean it 's yours ? - I 'm the one who stole it !
 Babe , I 'm sorry .
 You 're just gonna have to wait .

 Thank you very much , Bree . Seeing your tile has helped me make my decision .
 Next time I remodel I 'm using limestone .
 Gabrielle , is everything OK ?
 - Sure , why ?

 It 's just that you 've been acting kind of odd lately .
 - In what way ?

 You 're coming up with excuses to use everyone 's bathroom , and 2 days ago Mr Kalli saw you and Carlos in your backyard , doing the laundry in your jacuzzi .
 Well , there 's a simple explanation for that . I --

 Are you two having some sort of money trouble ?
 Gabby , it 's OK if you are .
 - Is that so ?
 - Yes , and to tell you the truth , I 'm a little insulted .
 I 'm a good friend . Why would you feel that you have to hide that from me ?
 I don 't know , probably for the same reason you didn 't tell me Rex was one of Maisy 's clients .
 That is obviously different .

 Why ?
 Because it happened to you ?

 Bree , this is how I see it :
 Good friends support each other after they 've been humiliated . Great friends pretend nothing happened in the first place .
 Well , then -- good luck on your remodel .
 - And please tell Rex I said hello .
 Hey Tammy .
 Lynnette !
 I see Topher has made a speedy recovery !
 Can we go playing ?
 - Sure , boys , have fun . Wow , let 's go play in the buzz house !
 All right , you caught me .
 I lied .
 But you have some nerve crushing a 6 year old 's birthday party .
 Just so you know , I got Topher a set of bongo drums .
 I know you 'll love them as much as he will .
 Charlie , come on out ! I don 't want you to play with the Scavo boys .
 Mona , please , I 'm sure they 're clean .
 You are not ruining my party .
 Porter , Prustin , out out , let 's go .
 - No , not quite yet .

 Boys , keep bouncing . That 's right .
 Oh , by the way , I spoke to nurse Abigail . I know who Patient Zero is .
 - All right , that 's it kids , get out . Go !
 How could you do that ?

 Look , this party meant everything to Topher .
 I couldn 't risk people not showing up . He would be devastated .
 I had to do something . - And the best you could come up with was letting my kids take the fault ?
 Hey , I hardly had to say anything .
 People were already suspicious .
 Oh please . - It 's true .
 Your boys aren 't the cleanest kids on the planet .
 That was not a smart thing to say .
 Where are you going ?
 - I 'm telling the truth to every mother out there , then I 'll take back the bongos .
 Wait !
 OK , I was wrong , I admit it . I am really really sorry .
 Too little too late .

 OK , I 'll tell everyone that I was wrong .
 That your kids aren 't the ones .
 Please , I 'm begging you !
 Well , why are you standing there ?
 Get to it .

 Bree , hi !
 What 's up ?
 Well , I have been doing some thinking .
 Rex and I have been members of the Fairview country club for years , and lately it seems to have lost some exclusivity , so I decided not to renew our membership .
 I 'd rather see the money go to someone I care about .
 Oh Bree , I can 't take that .
 Gabby , this is the way I see it : Good friends offer to help in a crisis .
 Great friends don 't take no for an answer .
 We 'll pay you back every cent , I promise .
 Take your time .
