 00 : 00 : 02, 696 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 011 Who wants the last dumpling ? Ooh , me !
 Penny , a moment .
 We just had Thai food .
 In that culture , the last morsel is called the " greng jie " piece , and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group .
 Thank you all for this high honor .
 I 've seen pictures of your mother ; keep eating .
 All right , honey , if we 're gonna make the movie , we should go .
 This may be hard for you to hear , but when I say " honey , " I mean my fiancée .
 Yeah , well , now it means her .
 It 's okay if he wants to come . Fine . But next time , we get a sitter .


 All right , I got to go to work .
 I 'll walk down with you .
 Wait .
 Which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia , the movie theater or The Cheesecake Factory ?
 Neither of them are close .
 Oh , well , then I guess it doesn 't matter which one of you drives me .
 Let 's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me .
 All right , this four- letter word describes either a printer 's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt .
 Okay , I 'm not driving him .
 Penny , don 't give up , you can get this .
 Aren 't you going with Sheldon ?
 No , I have no interest in model trains , stores that sell them , nor their heartbreaking clientele .
 Oh .
 Well , I have some work to do , so ...
 I can 't imagine that would disturb me . Carry on .
 Okay .
 Wouldn 't you be more comfortable at home ?
 Not really , no .
 All righty then .
 Guess I 'll just get started .
 Leonard , please .
 I don 't need the running commentary .

 Original Air Date on September 29 , 2011
 ( sighs softly )

 - Amy ?
 - Yo .

 You okay ?
 Oh , sure .
 I thought you were reading .
 I was .
 Now I 'm thinking about what I read .
 You all right , Leonard ?
 You seem very uncomfortable .
 I- I 'm fine .
 Should I go ? I 've been told sometimes I overstay my welcome .
 Wha ... who told you that ?
 Well , most recently my gynecologist .
 Well , you stay as long as you 'd like .
 I 'm glad to hear you say that , because I 'm having a wonderful time .
 ( chuckles )
 I said the same thing to my gynecologist .
 What are you going to get at the train store , Sheldon ?
 Oh , I 'm not buying anything .
 They 're having a lecture .
 " H- O gauge railroading . Half the size of O- gauge , but twice the fun . "
 Very controversial topic .
 Which side do you come down on ?
 I 'll let you know after tonight . Unlike some people , I 'm going in with an open mind .
 Who am I kidding ?
 Of course we all know it 's O- gauge or no gauge .
 Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains ?
 That 's pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother 's house .
 First of all , they 're not tricks , they 're illusions .
 And ... secondly , when we get married , they 're all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes .
 Why would I keep clothes at your mother 's house ?
 Well , don 't think of it that way . Once we move in , it 'll be our house .
 Is she moving out ?
 Why would she move out ?
 It 's her house .
 Hang on .
 You seriously think I 'm going to live with your mother ?
 Howard , I think I can help here . Yes , Bernadette , that 's exactly what he thinks .
 Why not ?
 It 's a great house , plenty of room , and if we have kids , Mom 's there to help .
 You know , en she tells " The Three Little Pigs " story , she actually has hair on her chinny- chin- chin .
 I 'm not gonna live with your mother . Not now , not ever .
 Wow , someone obviously has some mommy issues .
 Raj , take me home .
 Don 't listen to her .
 Go to the movie theater .
 Take me home now . Movie theater !
 ( groans )
 Okay , everybody calm down .
 There is a simple solution here .
 Raj , take me to the train store , and then I don 't care what you people do .
 How was your shower ?
 It was good , good .
 Just out of curiosity , what time do you usually go to bed ?
 Oh , I 'm up all night .
 I 'm like a possum .
 Boy , you were not liked in high school , were you ?
 Not really . - Is that my yearbook ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 " Dear Leonard , you 're really good at science .
 Maybe one day you 'll come up with a cure for being a dork . "
 Well , it wasn 't spray- painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase , I can tell you that .
 If it makes you feel any better , the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother .
 - Aw .
 - " Dear Amy ,
 " Self- respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun .
 Love , Mom . "
 Well , you can add Jerry 's Junction to the list of train stores
 Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again .
 Rough night , Casey Jones ?
 You don 't know the half of it .
 It was billed as a lively give- and- take on the merits of model train sizes .
 But it was actually a setup to intimidate weak- minded spineless rubes into buying H- O starter sets .
 What 's in the bag ?
 I don 't want to talk about it . But it 's not a spine , I 'll tell you that .
 Well , I had a delightful evening , Leonard .
 We should do this again sometime .
 Ah , sure .
 That 'd be nice .
 Glad to hear it .
 I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday .
 They 're kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department .
 Wouldn 't you rather bring Sheldon ? I would , but the last wedding we went to was a disaster .
 He behaved like a child the entire time .
 Not my fault .
 You said there 'd be other scientists there my age .

 Doesn 't matter .
 You 're out , he 's in .
 No date to the prom , two dates to a wedding .
 Hmm , how times change .
 ( singsongy ) : Ha- ha , you have to go to a wedding .
 ( doorbell rings )
 WOLOWlTZ : I 'll get it !
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Could you get it ? !
 I just said I 'm getting it !
 Fine , I 'll get it !
 I got it !
 Oh , hi .
 Hey .
 I don 't want to fight .
 I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living- with- your- mom stuff on me .
 Yeah , well , I 'm sorry I didn 't run it by you first .
 I don 't know who you 're talking to , but in or out !
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 We don 't need bugs !
 The bugs only come here because you 're their queen !
 Listen , how about this .
 Before we make any kind of decision about where we live , we have a trial run .
 Stay here for a weekend , see what it 's like .
 And your mom would be okay with that ?
 Sure she would . Hey , if she 's willing to give the milk away for free , who am I to say no ? ! Ma , do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend ? !
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :


 See ?
 She 's good with it . Frankly , after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy , a girl is a big relief ! MRS. WOLOWlTZ :


 All these years , I 've been so wrong .
 The tinier the train , the more concentrated the fun .


 You 're a brain scientist .
 Can you explain to me why a brilliant man
 likes playing with toy trains ?
 Not without cutting his head open , no .

 How about making my eyes like Cleopatra ?
 Really ?
 For a wedding ? Perhaps you 're right .
 My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain " hello sailor " quality to them .
 Ready .
 Aw .
 So handsome . Like James Bond .
 He 's better than James Bond , because he 's tinier .
 I got you this to give to me .
 Oh , sweetie , guests don 't normally wear corsages to a wedding .
 That 's more of a prom thing .
 I never went to my prom .
 My mom paid my cousin to take me , but he just used the money to buy drugs .
 Put the corsage on her .
 When you 're done copping a feel , that goes on my wrist .
 ( high- pitched ) :
 All aboard !
 Woo- woo ! ( normal voice ) :
 It 's official .
 I 'm an H- O trainiac .

 So , dinner went nice .
 Yeah . Yeah , I guess .
 Does your mother always cut your meat for you ?
 Only when it 's fatty .
 Well , don 't be jealous , babe .
 Someday you 'll get to cut it for me . MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Bernadette !
 I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it !
 I 'm okay , Mrs. Wolowitz . MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 You sure ? ! I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth !
 Hey , Ma , how about a little privacy ? !
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Oh , I know what that means !
 Hubba- hubba !
 Oh , God .
 Relax , it 'll be fine .
 Okay . MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Let me know when you 're done canoodling !
 Mommy needs a foot rub !
 ♪ ♪


 Would you like to dance ?
 No , thank you . I 'm really not much of a dancer .
 You 're not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist , either .
 I 'm sorry .
 The bride and groom seem happy .
 AMY : Why shouldn 't they be ?
 They have a feverish night of socially- approved copulation ahead of them .
 In some cultures , we 'd stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm .
 That sounds like a late night , and I have work in the morning , so ...
 Leonard , you may not have noticed , but I am being a delight here .
 And you 're not holding up your end of the evening .
 Oh , sorry .
 This wedding just reminds me of my kinda- sorta girlfriend 9, 000 miles away .
 I have a kinda- sorta boyfriend who 's playing with a model train right now , you don 't hear me bitching about it .
 Leonard , a word of advice -- moody self- obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you .

 I 'm not moody .
 I 'm fun . You have any evidence to support that statement ?
 Well , hey , I 'm just as much fun as you are .
 Are you willing to draw a mustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker ? Really ?

 I am .
 Okay , fine , what do you suggest ? ♪ ♪
 We just had a lovely meal , the band ... is on fire ... and you 're sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup .
 Why don 't we head out on the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields .
 Once again , I- I 'm really not much of a dancer .
 Don 't worry ...
 I 'll lead .
 ( " The Chicken Dance " playing )
 ( imitating lightsaber )

 Howard ?
 ( imitates lightsaber turning off )
 Ready for bed ? No .
 I need to brush my teeth , but your moth 's been in the bathroom for , like , an hour .
 Oh .
 Yeah , she sometimes has problems doing her business .
 Hang on .
 Ma , give up ! Tonight 's not your night !
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 You don 't know that ! I just sat down !
 WOLOWlTZ : Come on , take a break !
 Bernadette needs to brush her teeth !
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 She can come in and brush her teeth ! I 'm not embarrassed !
 Problem solved .
 No , it 's not .
 I 'm not going in there .
 Oh , come on , honey .
 She 's just sitting in there reading a magazine .
 You can 't see anything . I go in all the time .
 ( chuckles )

 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Ha !
 The eagle has landed ! ( toilet flushing )
 And we have splashdown .
 ( clears throat )
 Wait here , I 'm gonna go light a candle .
 And then we make passionate love .

 There we go , last floor .
 I just can 't figure out what happened .
 I put my left leg in , I took my left leg out ,
 I put my left leg in , and something just snapped .
 The hokey pokey is a young man 's game .
 ( chuckles ) I did have a great time .
 Thank you for reminding me it 's okay to have fun once in a while .
 You 're welcome .
 And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin .
 I excel at spatial reasoning , and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely .

 Well , okay . Again , thank you .
 And again , you 're welcome .

 Want to come in ?
 No , thanks . I 'm gonna head home . ' Kay .
 Well , good night .
 Good night .


 Ames , hi .
 How was the wedding ? Great .
 Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me .
 Come in , let 's talk .
 Do you want a glass of wine ?
 Wine is one of the reasons I 'm in this fix .
 That and this dang pelvis .
 Okay , I 'm sorry , what exactly happened ?
 The inevitable -- he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend , while I was charming , supportive and , let 's face it , in this dress , the perfect combination of Madonna and whore .

 Oh , God , did he make a move on you ?
 No , but it 's only a matter of time . How could I have not seen this coming ?
 Now I 'm gonna have to break the little sad sack 's heart .
 - Yeah , I 'm sure he 'll be okay .
 - Oh , Penny , much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man ,
 Leonard just doesn 't get my motor running .

 So , um , what are you gonna do ?
 Do you want me to talk to Leonard , let him down easy ?
 No . I 'll let him have tonight .
 Then in the morning ,
 I 'll send him an e- mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland .
 I mean , frankly , you 've got a better shot than he does .


 Leonard .
 Check it out .
 I bought an N- gauge locomotive .
 Half the size of H- O.
 Look , it fits in my mouth .
 Sounds like you had a night .
 ( muffled ) :
 I did . - How was yours ? - Not bad .
 I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would .
 What exact do you mean by that ?
 Well , it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time .
 Although , truth be told , my groin 's a little worse for wear .
 Ow !
 Why did you do that ?
 To send a message : she is not for you .
 What ?
 Not for you !


 Good morning , handsome .
 Morning , Mom .
 It 's me .
 Yes , it is , and you 're so pretty in the morning .
 Your mom and I made you breakfast .
 ( laughs ) Oh , wow .
 So you guys are getting along ?
 Yeah , I guess .
 We 're very different people , Howard , so communication 's a little tricky .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Does he like the pancakes ? !
 He didn 't try them yet !
 Is there any butter ?
 - It 's butter- flavored syrup .
 - Oh . MRS. WOLOWlTZ : So , what 's the word ? !
 He wants butter !
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 It 's butter- flavored syrup !
 I just told him that !


 I don 't need any butter .
 If you want butter , I 'll get you butter .
 Well , I guess I 'll cut these by myself .
