 00 : 00 : 01, 715 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 267 Okay , now holding sides of hearth in position , lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs .
 Look at that , I built a fireplace with my own two hands .
 You 're so butch .
 Aw , I got a little paper cut .
 Of course you did .
 Your hands are softer than veal .
 Oh , before I forget , Saturday I 'm planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys . Really ?
 That 's how you 're gonna spend your Saturday night ? Oh , come on , I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore .
 Oh , you poor thing .
 Is having a real- life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games ?
 Little bit , yeah .
 Oh , great !
 I 've always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons . Yeah , oh , I 'm sorry .
 I should 've mentioned this earlier .
 You 're not invited .
 Why not ?
 Amy , from time to time , we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves .
 By rolling dice and playing make- believe with little figurines ? Yeah , like a bunch of savages .

 BERNADETTE :
 Saturday night ?
 But I 've been working late all week .
 That was gonna be our night . But I have to go .
 We play as a group .
 If- if I 'm not there , then everyone will blame you . They 'll be all , " Bernadette ruined everything .
 She 's the worst . "
 So , you see ?
 ( chuckles )
 I have to play Dungeons and Dragons ... for the marriage .
 You 're an idiot .
 I 'm your idiot .
 Forever .
 So , listen , I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake , and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park , but Leonard 's talking about a big D and D game at his place .
 Saturday night just went from crazy to epic ! Woo- hoo ! ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ... Wait ! ♪ ♪ The Earth began to cool ♪ The autotrophs began to drool , Neanderthals developed tools ♪ ♪ We built the Wall ♪ ♪ ♪ Math , Science , History , unraveling the mystery ♪ ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪ ♪ ♪
 Original Air Date on December 13 , 2012
 All right , Sheldon , to start our quest , you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you .
 A Christmas gift ?
 You know I don 't enjoy Christmas .
 What 's wrong with Christmas ? Oh , where to begin ?
 Trees indoors .
 Overuse of the words " ' tis " and " ' twas . " And the absurd custom of one stocking .
 Everyone knows socks belong in pas .
 Who uses one sock ?
 Pirate with a peg leg ?
 ( chuckles )
 Actually that helps , thank you . Would you just look inside ?
 ( groans ) Oh , a scroll .
 I like scrolls . They 're my third favorite system of transmitting the written word .
 After stone tablets and skywriting .
 " You have all been summoned to join " a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure .
 " Your quest begins " in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred . "
 ( gasps ) I like where this is heading .
 " Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres . "
 Oh , that 's a saucy twist . " That leader 's name : Santa Claus "
 No , no , no ! It 's actually , " Ho , ho , ho , " but you 'll get the hang of it .
 Thought it 'd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme .
 Fun ? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is
 like making a sandwich of grape jelly , the best- tasting jelly , and petroleum jelly , the worst- tasting jelly .
 Okay , here we go . " You find yourselves
 " in the smoking remains of Santa 's village .
 Clearly , a great battle has taken place . " Oh , man , the first monster I see ,
 I 'm gonna sneak up behind him , whip out my wand , and shoot my magic all over his ass .
 Do you hear yourself when you say these things ?
 LEONARD : Okay , there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow .
 Sheldon , what do you do ?
 I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says , " Get a load of this guy . "
 Fine .
 Howard , what do you do ? I follow the ogre tracks , checking for secret doors along the way .
 ( dice rolls on table ) And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor .
 Okay , guys , let 's make a plan : spell casters in the back , warriors in the front ...
 No , screw that noise , I 'm going in .
 Hang on , Santa , I 'm coming for you !
 Okay , you run into a room full of weapons , hit a trip wire ... ( dice rolls on table ) ... a cannon blows your face off , you die , you 're out of the game .
 But ... a canon ?
 Am I really out of the game ?
 Lucky .
 Okay , come on , moving on . Wait , doesn 't anyone have a roof resurrection ?
 Because if you 've got one , I need it bad .
 Get in here with your rod and give it to me .
 Okay , you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud .
 ( knock on door )
 Hey , guys .
 I don 't mean to interrupt your little game , but I thought you 'd like to see what you 're missing out on .
 So ... ( clears throat ) Bernadette ?
 ( music plays from phone )
 Bernadette 's wearing leopard- print pumps and a rack- tastic red dress from Forever 21 .
 And there 's Amy , showing all kinds of ankle .
 In an outfit I 'm assuming is from Forever 63 .
 And I , myself ... ... am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty .
 I know they 're making a rhetorical point ,
 I just don 't know what it is . See you , boys .
 We are going drinking . Uh , wait , can I come with you ?
 My character died . Sorry , Raj , it 's girls ' night out .
 Maybe another time .
 ( door closes )
 Okay ...
 Come on .
 Ooh !
 Girls ' night , girls ' night !
 ( whoops )
 How does he not hear that ?
 So , what 's the plan ?
 Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk , luring strange men into the bathroom , and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses ?
 No ! No !
 Geez , who 's Forever 63 now ?
 Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table ?
 Don 't worry .
 It 's my treat .
 Thanks . Wow !
 You should come to girls ' night more often .
 And not just because if you weren 't here , this would be a can of Pabst . My pleasure ; nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady .
 Just ask my dog .
 My vet says if I give her any more foie gras , she 's going to die of gout .
 Hey , let 's help Raj meet a girl tonight .
 No , no , no , I 'm fine . Okay , wait , are we talking one- night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship ?
 Let 's get him laid !
 Stop it .
 You 're ruining girls ' night .
 Raj , you 're a great guy , you 're in a bar full of single women ; let us help you .
 Yeah , you 're a real catch . I know you 're shy , but that doesn 't mean you shouldn 't have someone wonderful in your life .
 That 's sweet of you .
 But what can you do to help ? We 'll nose around , see if we can find a nice girl , and then introduce you .
 Okay .
 Well , a couple of things . Don 't tell them I come from money .
 I want them to love me for me .
 They must be insanely hot .
 Like , nines or tens .
 Nines or tens ?
 Okay , an eight is acceptable if she 's willing to bring another eight to the hot tub . Bottom line : you 'll take any woman who 'll have you , right ?
 In a New Delhi minute .
 I don 't remember you buying these miniatures in my store .
 Oh , uh , yeah . I got 'em on Amazon .
 Sure .
 I get it . Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend ?
 I know , but when I shop online , I can do it on the toilet .
 Have you seen my store ?
 The whole place is a toilet .
 C- Can we please move this along ?
 Yeah , sorry . Uh , you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest .
 What do you do ? And , Howard , do not say , ( mimicking ) :
 " I feel up the large chest . " Excuse me , I 'm a married man now .
 I wasn 't going to say anything so juvenile .
 Great . What do you do ? I walk up to the large chest , bury my face in it and go ( motorboat noises ) .
 I open the chest .
 It 's locked , but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in .
 That 's not good .
 My character and I both have claustrophobia . Glowing letters appear on the chest that read ,
 " If squashed to death you wish not to be , sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory . "
 Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav ?
 Walls are getting closer .
 Oh , boy , happy place , happy place . Wait , Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia .

 You 're ten seconds away from getting crushed ! Nine , eight ...
 What are we supposed to do ? ... seven , six ...
 Wait , wait . Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol .
 Never heard of it .
 Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy . ... three , two ...
 Somebody sing the damn song ! ♪ Good King Wenceslas looked out ♪ ♪ On the feast of Stephen ♪ When the snow lay ' round about ♪ ♪ Deep and crisp and even
 The walls are getting slower . ♪ Brightly shone the moon that night ♪ ♪ Though the frost was cru- el ♪ ♪ When a poor man came in sight ♪ ♪ Gath 'ring winter fu- el
 The walls stop !
 You 're safe !
 That was amazing , Sheldon .
 How did you know that ?
 It was simple . I combined a well- known , historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents ,
 Mee- Maw and Pop- Pop , singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high- energy particle accelerator out of Legos .
 Okay , continuing our quest . W- W- Wait .
 There 's still four more verses .
 You don 't sing a song and not finish it . ♪ Hither , page , and stand by me ♪ ♪ If thou know 'st it , telling ♪ ♪ Yonder peasant , who is he ? ♪ Where and what his dwelling ? ♪ Brightly shone the moon that night , though the frost ... ♪



 Looks like he 's doing pretty good .
 Of course he is . Look , that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend .
 She 's angry , she 's drunk , and her favorite movie is
 I mean ...
 That is some low- hanging fruit .
 Oh , here he comes . So , how 'd it go ?
 Great .
 I bought her a couple of drinks , and she gave me her e- mail address . Ooh !
 " Jennifer@ not- even- if- you- were - the- last- guy- on- earth . loser "
 What ?
 I 'm sorry , Raj . Why can 't I find someone ?
 I 'm smart , I 've got a cool job , and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can 't .
 Oh , honey , it 's not you , it 's them .
 No , it 's not .
 She was too beautiful for me .
 Why would you say that ? It 's true .
 I 'm always attracted to women I can 't have .
 I do it all the time .
 I did the same thing with the two of you .
 The two of them ? I don 't understand .
 Well , uh , there was a time when I had a thing for Penny , and I thought she was into me , too , because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me .
 But apparently I misread those signals .
 And you liked Bernadette also ?
 That was before Penny .
 I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends ' girlfriends at a time .
 I 'm very old- fashioned that way .
 So at , uh , some point , you probably had a thing for me , too .
 No , not really .
 Oh , come on , Raj , not even a little bit ?
 Not that I can think of .
 Think harder .
 Nope .
 I guess the heart wants what the heart wants .
 Or in this case , doesn 't .
 I mean , at all .
 What ?
 ♪ Ye who now will bless the poor ♪ ♪ Shall yourselves find blessing ♪ ♪ Ba- da- bum .
 Done ?
 I think the word you 're looking for is " bravo . "
 Okay , you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen .
 Melted snowmen ? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water ?
 I don 't know .
 What 's the difference ? It 's a game of the imagination , Leonard . Paint a picture .
 Fine .
 You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen .
 There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water .
 ( stutters ) What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes ?
 You see those , too .
 Oh , it 's like I 'm really there .
 I gotta tell you , this- this is the most holiday fun I 've had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool .
 Good story .
 What are you drinking there ?
 Little eggnog ? Yes .
 What , is there a problem ?
 No , it 's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage .
 Pretty Christmasy . Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink ?

 Eggs are available all year 'round .
 I 've been known to enjoy this poolside . Come on , Sheldon .
 You know all the Christmas stories , and the carols , you 've got an eggnog mustache going on there .
 Just admit it . You 're getting a little Yuletide spirit .
 Oh , don 't be silly . Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry .
 Why is this so important to you ?
 Honestly , because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I 'm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now .
 What was so bad about them ? I grew up in a house full of crazy academics .
 Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies , we had to leave him a research paper .
 And in the morning , you could tell he 'd been there because the paper would be graded .
 No wonder you love Christmas .
 That sounds amazing .
 It wasn 't amazing .
 I got a C- minus four years in a row .
 Yeah , I 'm familiar with your work .
 C- minus was your gift .

 Amy , I 'm really sorry .
 I didn 't mean to upset you .
 It 's fine . I 'm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice .
 I didn 't have my first kiss till I was 22 , and the guy only did it so I 'd give him back his insulin .
 Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants .
 Forget it .
 I don 't expect you guys to understand . I understand .
 In seventh grade , I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar .
 She said if I came near her , she would break the bottle and cut me .
 You think that 's bad ?
 In college , I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on .

 Sometimes I get so lonely ,
 I sit on my left hand until it goes numb , then I put it in my right hand and pretend
 I 'm holding hands with another person .
 I do that , too .
 Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel .
 And I let it .
 It 's kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone .
 It is , isn 't it ?
 But you 're not alone anymore . Now you 've got Sheldon .
 I do .
 And don 't worry , someday you 'll have somebody , too .
 Thank you .
 I hope she 's half as lovely and amazing as you are .
 Thank you , Rajesh .
 He wants me , I 'm good .
 We can go now .
 Damn it .
 What ?
 Now that I know she doesn 't like me ,
 I 'm kind of into her . All right .
 I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge .
 Great .
 Let 's do it .

 The drawbridge is lowering .
 ( bell rings three times ) ( playing " Jingle Bells " )

 My carpal tunnel 's acting up .
 Play through the pain !
 ( playing " Jingle Bells " )

 You did it ! The drawbridge is down .
 You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room .
 And in the corner , chained to the wall , you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus .
 He says , " Ho , ho , help me . "
 Yes , we found Santa !
 Christmas is saved ! Don 't ever tell my mother I said that .
 I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him .
 But first , I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard .
 Wait , what are you doing ? You can 't talk ; you 're paralyzed .
 I get right up in Santa 's big , fat face and say ...
 Well , well , well , jolly old Saint Nick , we meet again .
 Yeah , I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston , Texas , when I was five years old , isn 't that right ?
 Uh , okay .
 My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas .
 And I told you " my Pop- Pop , " because that was the year my grandfather died .
 I missed him and I wanted him back .
 This is weird , right ?
 Pop- Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science .
 But you didn 't bring him back , did you ? Instead , I got Lincoln Logs .
 Well , you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs , but Pop- Pop ain 't one of 'em .
 And now you 're here asking me for something -- to save you .
 Well , sorry , Mr. Kringle , but today 's not your day .
 I 'm leaving you here to rot , and I hope the ogres feast on your bones .
 I take the skeleton key , and I toss it into the chasm , and on the way out , I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly !
 Okay .
 So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed , Santa 's dead , and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend .

 Santa ?
 Oh , hello , Sheldon .
 You should be asleep . Well , then , you shouldn 't have jingle bells on your boots .
 Oh ...
 I 've been wanting to talk to you . I 'm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy .
 I- I can do a lot of magical things , but unfortunately bringing your Pop- Pop back isn 't one of them .
 I understand .
 But I- I do have something special for you .
 Close your eyes .
 Oh , I hope it 's a train .
 Oh , it 's better than a train .
 Two trains ?
 Better .
 I 'm getting three trains .
 Okay , open 'em .

 This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres !
 Wait , uh , uh , hang on .
 I- In my defense ...
 Ho , ho , ho , ya big dork !
