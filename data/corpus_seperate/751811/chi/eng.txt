 The car 's only just got back from the Palace . Any moment now , then .

 So who was on the phone ?
 Frank Wiesel .
 He 's coming right over .

 Yes , I 've got a bit of a headache ...
 I will ring you back . I 'm waiting fora rather important call ... bye bye .
 Alderman Spottiswood .
 I wish people wouldn 't ring to congratulate me .
 I 'm waiting forthe call .
 It 's as if you 're about to enterthe Ministry .
 Yes , but which Ministry , that 's the point .
 Itwas a joke !
 Oh , I see .
 - Are you very tense ?
 - No , I 'm not .
 A politician 's wife is not allowed to . A happy carefree politician 's wife .
 - What are you looking for ?
 - A cigarette .
 Try the cigarette box .
 - It 's empty .
 - Take a librium . I can 't find it , that 's why I 'm looking fora cigarette .

 Oh , Jim , I 've had it .
 Would you pop out and get some ?
 Sorry , I daren 't leave the phone .
 If the PM wants you to be in the cabinet , he 'll phone back .
 Oryou can phone back . I ran the campaign against the PM forthe leadership .
 - If I 'm out , well , who knows .
 - I could take a message .

 There it is .
 Hello ... yes , speaking ...
 Oh , it 's you Michael ...
 I haven 't had a call , have you ?
 Bill 's had a call ?
 What 's he got ?
 Europe ?
 - Bill 's got Europe .
 - Lucky Europe . - Does Bill speak French ?
 - He can hardly speak English .
 I 'll call you back if I hear anything .
 Right ...
 Bye .

 Fingers crossed .
 Hello ...
 Yes , speaking ...
 The Gas Board .
 Good Lord man , thatwas weeks ago .
 I 'm waiting fora rather important call ...
 Look , there happened to be a general election yesterday ...
 You voted forthe otherside , did you ?
 How did you get to the polling booth on the right day ?
 With two assistants , three return visits forspare parts ?
 Look , Mr. Franklin ...
 Frankly Franklin , I don 't care if the heating system collapses in ruins .
 I 've got to get off this phone , goodbye .
 They won 't come now . If I get ConsumerAffairs , they 'll come .

 Hello ?
 Hello ?
 Hello ? Darling , thatwas the front doorbell .

 It 'll be Frank .

 - Martin 's got the Foreign Office .
 - Has he ?
 Jack 's got Health and Fred 's got Energy .
 - Has anyone got Brains ?
 - Do you mean Education ?
 No , I knowwhat I mean .
 - What 's left ?
 What have I got ?
 - Rhythm ?
 Frank , I have heard absolutely nothing , not that it 's surprising .
 My whole career is going down the drain because the PM is unable to reach me on the telephone .
 You get it , darling .

 - Hello .
 - Hello , this is the BBC .
 Would Mr. Hacker like to be interviewed on the PM program ?

 - PM ?
 - PM ?

 Jim Hackerhere ...

 Yes .
 Any time you like .
 Could we interview you ?
 I 'd been hoping you 'd call .
 What job do you think you 're likely to get ?

 I beg yourpardon ?

 What job do you think you 're likely to get ?
 That 's foryou to tell me .
 - What ? - Well , it 's not up to me to say .

 That 's forthe PM to say .
 You 're the PM 's office ... Oh , I see .
 The BBC PM office !
 How silly , what a silly mistake , Yes ... yes .
 Good bye .
 I did try and tell you .
 You answerthe bloody thing .
 Hello ...
 Mrs. Hackerspeaking .
 Oh , congratulations , " Prime Minister " .
 It 's Annie here .
 Give me that phone .
 Hello ...
 Yes ...
 Prime Minister .
 Yes , of course ...
 Yes , I ...
 Righto .
 I 'll be on the next train .
 Top tip forAdministrative Affairs is Jim Hacker .
 Kenneth , isn 't he on the young side fora Cabinet post ?
 Yes , well , he 's in his late forties .
 But it 's certainly a jump up forhim .
 On the otherhand , this department 's been a bit of a political graveyard recently .
 A furthergroup of Cabinet appointments has nowbeen announced from Number Ten .
 The Ministry of Administrative Affairs goes toJim Hacker , the formerShadow Minister forAgricultura .
 - Good afternoon , Minister .
 - Good afternoon .
 Bernard Wooley , Principal Private Secretary .
 Mr. Lloyd Pritchard , Assistant Private Secretary .
 - This is my political adviser ...
 - Oh yes , of course , Mr. Weasel .
 Wiesel .

 I was the Minister 's Principal Private Secretary in the last goverment .

 However if you ...
 - I 'm sure you 'll be just the thing .
 - Thank you , Minister , howkind .
 - Where are we all going to ?
 - You are going to youroffice .

 What about Frank ?
 - Where 's Frank ?
 - He 's being taken care of .
 - Would you wait here ?
 - This is the Waiting Room .
 - Precisely , sir .
 - I 'm Jim Hacker 's adviser .
 He has a whole department to advise him .
 - He needs me .
 - Of course .
 But until he sends foryou , please , wait .

 A sherry Minister ?
 Jim .
 Oh Gin .
 No , no , Jim , Jim .
 Call me Jim .

 I would preferto call you Minister , Minister .
 Minister , Minister ?
 Oh quite , quite .
 I see what you mean . Do I have to call you Private Secretary , Private Secretary ?

 - No .
 Do call me Bernard .
 - Thank you , Bernard .
 You 're mostwelcome .
 Yourhealth , Minister .

 Well what now ?
 Allowme to present Sir Humphrey Appleby ,
 Permanent UnderSecretary of State and Head of the D. A. A.
 - Hello , Sir Humphrey .
 - Hello , and welcome .
 - Thank you .
 - I believe you know each other . Yes , we did cross swords in the Public Accounts Committee .

 I wouldn 't say that .
 You came up with all the questions .
 Opposition 's about asking questions .
 And Government 's about not answering them .
 You answered mine .
 I 'm glad you thought so .
 Good luck .
 - Who else is in this Department ?
 - I am the Permanent UnderSecretary known as the Permanent Secretary .
 Wolley is your Principal Private Secretary .
 And I too have a Principal Private Secretary .
 Directly responsible to me are 10 Deputy Secretaries 87 UnderSecretaries , and 219 Assistant Secretaries .
 Responsible to the PPS are Parliamentary Private Secretaries .
 The PM will be appointing two Parliamentary UnderSecretaries , and you will appoint yourown Parliamentary Private Secretary .
 Can they all type ?
 None of us can type .
 Mrs. McKay types .
 She is the Secretary .
 Pity we could have opened an agency .
 - Very droll , sir .
 - Yes , very very amusing .
 - I suppose they all say that .
 - Certainly not , Minister .
 Not quite all .
 Right , now then , to business .
 Forgive me if I 'm a bit blunt , but that 's the sort of chap I am ...
 Frankly , this depart ...
 This chair 's a bit ...
 We can change it , Minister .
 We can change the furniture , decor , office routine ...
 - Yourwish is ourcommand .
 - I 'd like a new chair .
 Hate swivel chairs .
 Two kinds of chairs to go with the two kinds of Minister .
 One sort folds up instantly , the othersort goes round and round in circles .
 Now , frankly this Department has got to cut a great swathe through all this stuffy Whitehall bureaucracy .
 We 're going to throw open the windows ,
 let in a bit of fresh air , cut through all the red tape , streamline this creaking old bureaucratic machine .
 - You mean a clean sweep ?
 - A clean sweep . Fartoo many people just sitting behind desks .
 Not like us , of course .
 Butwe 've got to get rid of all those people .
 - Get rid of them ?
 - " Redeploy them " .
 Yes . Good Lord no , I don 't mean put them out of work .
 Open Government , that 's what my partybelieves in , thatwas the main plank of ourmanifesto .
 Taking the nation into ourconfidence .
 Nowhow does that strike you ?
 Do sit down .
 Just as you said in the House on May 2nd last year , and again on November 23rd , and in The Observer and in The Daily Mail , and as yourmanifesto made clear .

 You know about that ?
 Please , have a look at these proposals .
 These are the ways to implement this policy and proposals fora white paper foryourapproval .
 The white papermight be called " Open Government " .
 - You mean it 's all been ...
 - Taken care of , Minister . - Who did all this ?
 - The old bureaucratic machine .
 No , quite seriously . We are seized of the need forreform .
 - And we have taken it on board .
 - I 'm rathersurprised .
 I expected to have to fight you with this .
 People do have funny ideas about the Civil Service . We 're just here to implement yourpolicies .

 " Proposals forshortening approval procedures in planning appeals " ?
 Hansard Volume 497 , page 1102 , Column B.
 Quote " Mr. Hacker :
 Is the Ministeraware that planning procedures make building a bungalow in the 20th century slowerthan building a cathedral in the 12th century ?
 Opposition laughter and Government cries of shame " .
 - They didn 't actually cry shame .
 - Quite so , Minister .
 - Right , I think that 's it then ?
 - There are two more things ...
 This is yourdiary fornextweek , Minister .
 My diary ?
 You didn 't know I was coming .
 Norwho 'd win the election .
 - There 'd be a Minister , Minister .
 - Don 't start that again . Even though we didn 't know itwould be you .
 Her Majesty does like the business of government to continue even when there are no politicians around .
 - Bit difficult surely ?
 - Yes ... and no .
 It 's a busy week .
 Nine cabinet committees , the Annual dinner of the Law Institute .
 You will have to make a speech .
 Deputation from the British ComputerAssociation .
 Opening the National Union of Public Employers meeting .
 - Anotherspeech ...
 - Wait a minute ...
 - What about all the otherthings ?
 - What otherthings ?
 I 'm on fourpolicy committees forthe party . You won 'twant to be putting partybefore country .
 No , no , of course not .
 I 'll just fetch yourboxes , Minister .

 Boxes ? Already .
 The last Ministerhad some work throughout the campaign , but I fear ... well , it 's not forme to criticise ...
 - What do you mean ?
 - It 's a harsh thing to say . Some of the boxes actually came back with the work not done .
 If you complete the first four by Saturday , yourdriverwill deliver the othertwo .

 Villa 's at home to Liverpool .
 And I 've got a surgery on Saturday .
 If we minimise it , you need only take the majorpolicy decisions .
 No , no .
 No . No .
 I take all the decisions round here .
 Now then what time shall I come in on Monday ?
 You 'll catch the 7 . 45 train from New Street , and yourdriver will meet you at Euston .
 If I could just put in these draft proposals .
 And here , this is yourkey , Minister .
 Out of my way .
 I 've had enough of this .
 - You can 't go in there .
 - Just try and stop me .
 - Jim , what 's going on ?
 - Frank , where 've you been ?
 - Stuck in the waiting room .
 - We are in private conference .
 - Then I should be here , too .
 - Calm down , Frank . Humphrey , Frank has got to have an office ofhis own .

 - Certainly , if you insist .
 - I do insist . I do think we have some spare office space in Walthamstow .

 - Walthamstow ?
 - Yes , it 's surprising .
 The Government owns property all over London .
 - I don 'twant to be there .
 - It 's in a very nice part . Walthamstow 's a very nice place so I gather .

 - I need an office here .
 - Why 's that ?
 Yes , I agree with Frank .
 Bernard , we must find an office here for Mr. Weasel .
 Wiesel . Copies of all the papers that come to me go to Frank .


 - All ? - All .
 It shall be done .
 All the appropriate papers .

 How 's yournew Minister , Humphrey ?
 Learning the rules very quicklyfora newboy .
 - How 's yournew Cabinet ?
 - No problem .
 Similarto the last one .
 Arnold , I hearthe American Ambassador 's been spending a lot of time with the PM .
 - Yes .
 - Defence ortrade ?
 Both .
 The aerospace systems contract ?
 Ssh .
 Don 'twant the cabinet to hearabout it yet .
 This aerospace thingumy would be rathera coup forthe PM , wouldn 't it ?
 Yes , now the new PM will take the credit .
 Sorry to intrude SirArnold , Sir Humphrey , if you could just OK the Minister 's speech ,
 I can get it straight to the House .
 Yes , of course .
 Like to join us ? Oh , thank you , so long as I 'm not too long .
 Get yourself a cup of coffee .
 So itwould be rather an embarrassment to the PM , wouldn 't it ? if a hypothetical Ministerwere to rock the Anglo American boat ?
 Grave embarrassment .
 How grave ?
 Man overboard , I should think .
 Enough to cut short a promising new Ministerial career ?
 No question .
 Pull up a chair , Bernard ...
 And tell us what you think of ournew Minister .
 Well absolutelyfine . Yes , we 'll have him housetrained in no time .
 He swallowed the whole diary , and I gatherhe did his boxes like a lamb lastweekend ?

 Yes . Yes he did . We must head him off this Open Government nonsense .
 We were calling the White Paper " Open Government " .
 Always dispose of the difficult bit in the title .
 Does less harm there than in the text .
 The less you intend to do about something , the more you have to talk about it .
 What 's wrong with open government ?
 Why shouldn 't the public know more about what 's going on ?
 Are you serious ?
 Well , I mean it 's the Minister 's policy , afterall .
 It 's a contradiction in terms .
 You can be open oryou can have government . But surely the citizens of a democracy have a right to know .

 No . They have a right to be ignorant .
 Knowledge only means complicity and guilt .
 Ignorance has a certain dignity .
 But if the Ministerwants ...
 You don 't just give people what they want , if it 's not good forthem .
 Do you give brandy to an alcoholic ?
 Thatway people don 't know what you are doing wrong .

 I am the Minister 's Private Secretary , and ifhe wants ...
 You must not help him to make a fool ofhimself .
 Look at the Ministers we 've had .
 They would have been a laughing stock had it not been forthe most rigid secrecy about theirdoings .
 What do you propose to do ?
 - Can you keep a secret ?
 - Of course .
 So can I.
 Excuse me , I have to make a phone call .
 Well , I 'd betterbe getting this back to the Minister .

 Martin .
 Has the weasel had a copy of the invoice forthe new American addressing machines ?
 I thought you said it was sensitive .
 So it is .
 Get it to him today . Oh , and Martin , let him find it nearthe bottom of the pile .

 Jim , Jim .
 - Yes .
 - Look what I 've found .
 We 've got them by the short and curlies .
 We 've got Sir Humphrey Bloody Appleby and Mr. Toffee Nosed Snooty Wolley just where we want them .

 See this ?
 This innocent- looking piece of paper .
 Political dynamite .
 Calm down .
 What are you talking about ? This is an invoice for 1 . 000 computervideo display terminals .
 At 10 . 000 pounds each , that is , ten milion pounds .
 So ? Made by the Pittsburgh Manufacturing Corporation Inc . ,
 - Imported from America ?
 - I know .
 Butwe make computerperipherals in this country .
 - In my constituency .
 - I know !
 - What about unemployment ?
 - I know !
 This must be stopped .
 - Sir Humphrey to see ... oh sorry .
 - Oh no . No , come in .
 I want to see you both , come on .
 Sir Humphrey , take a seat .
 Thank you , Minister .
 Now then , Frank here has just discovered this contract forthe import of ten million pound 's worth of video display terminals , from America .
 May I see ?

 Oh yes . Forthe whole Civil Service in Whitehall .
 - But they 're not British .
 - That is true .
 - We make them in this country .
 - Not of the same quality .
 Betterquality .
 In my constituency . - We were advised ...
 - This contract must be stopped .
 It 's beyond my power .
 This can only be cancelled by the Treasury .
 Why 's that ?
 Would be a majorpolicy change forthe Civil Service to cancel contracts , especially with overseas suppliers .
 If you 'd like to take it up with the Cabinet .
 How am I to face my constituency party ?
 Why need they know ?
 Why need anybody know ?
 We can see that it nevergets out .
 - Open Government .
 - That 's right . - It must be published .

 - That 's right .

 Why ?
 Well ... er ...
 - Why , Frank ?
 - The manifesto . And yourpredecessor will look like a traitor .
 - Two unanswerable reasons .
 - You didn 't bargain forthis !
 You 're not suggesting that the Ministershould make a positive reference to this confidential transaction in a speech ?
 Speech .
 That 's it .
 Jim , what about the speech to the Union of office Employees ?
 I 'll tell them about this scandalous contract .
 And we 'll release it to the press today .
 - Who 's running the country now ?
 - Well ... yes . - You object ?
 - It might be regrettable ,
 - if we upset the Americans .
 - The Americans .
 It 's time they lose theircommercial complacency . We must think of the British poor , not the American rich !

 If that is yourexpress wish , the Departmentwill back you , up to the hilt .
 That is my express wish . I 'd bettercirculate the speech forclearance .

 It does not involve any otherdepartment .
 Open Government demands thatwe include ourcolleagues , as well as ourfriends in Fleet Street .
 - Oh yes , that 's fairenough .
 - I 'm not sure .
 Thank you .
 And Humphrey ...
 See that goes straight to the press . We shall serve yourbest interests .

 Thank you .

 Now then ...
 Let me see .
 We 've made a pledge to the people about open government .
 So let 's have some .
 I have discovered that the previous government signed a contract to import office equipment
 - foruse by the Civil Service ...
 - Bureaucracy ! Used by the Civil Service bureaucracy .
 So , we are being fobbed off with second rate American junk by smart Aleck salesmen from Pittsburgh while British factories stand empty and British workmen queue up forthe dole .

 - Unemployment benefit .
 - The dole , Bernard .
 " Much as I personally value the friendship of ourgreat cousins from across the sea " .

 - Minister , something 's come up .
 - Yes ?
 - A minute from the PM 's Office .
 - I 'm prettybusy .
 - You ought to read this .
 - What does it say ?
 The PM is planning a visit to Washington fora valuable Anglo American defence trade agreement .
 Its importance cannot be overestimated .
 Fine .
 Has my speech gone to the press ?
 I presume so , as you requested . I 'm sorry , but all hell 's just broken loose at NumberTen .
 They 're asking why yourspeech didn 't obtain clearance .
 - What did you say ?
 - I mentioned open government . But it seemed to make things worse .
 The PM wants to see you in the House , right away .

 What 's going to happen ?
 The Prime Ministergiveth and he taketh away .
 Blessed be the name of the Prime Minister .


 Hello , Vic ...
 Sir Humphrey Appleby , Vic Gould , ourChiefWhip .
 You really are a pain in the arse .
 The PM 's going up the wall .
 Hitting the roof . You can 't go around making speeches like that .
 It 's Open Government .
 - Shut up , Weasel .
 - Wiesel ! But Open Governmentwas the main plank in ourmanifesto .
 - The PM believes in it too .
 - Open , yes .
 But not gaping . In politics you have to say things with tact , you berk !
 And when to say nothing at all .
 - How long you been a Minister ?
 - Week and half . You will appear in the Guinness book of records .
 I can see the headlines already .
 " Cabinet split on U. S. Trade .
 Hacker leads revolt against Prime Minister .
 That 's what you want , is it ?

 Ah , SirArnold , what news ?
 That speech is causing the PM some distress .
 Has it been released to the Press ?
 Well , the Ministergave express instructions fornoon .
 - Isn 't that right ?
 - I 'm appalled at you , Humphrey .
 How could you let the Minister put himself in this position ?
 We believe in open government .
 We want to open the windows .
 Isn 't that right , Minister ?
 It 's good party stuff , but it puts the PM in a very difficult situation .
 What about Open Government ?
 This seems to be the closed season foropen government .
 Do you want to give thought to a draft letterof resignation ?

 Just in case ...

 Can 'twe hush it up ?
 - Hush it up ?
 - Yes , hush it up .

 You mean ... suppress it ?
 Yes , I suppose I do .
 You mean thatwithin the framework of the guidelines about open goverment that you have laid down , you 're suggesting we should adopt a more flexible posture ?
 Am I ?
 Oh yes .
 Yes .
 About the press release ...
 A development could precipitate a reappraisal of ourposition .
 We forgot the interdepartmental clearance procedure .
 The supplementary stop order came into effect .
 So , yourspeech hasn 't gone to the Press .
 It 's only gone to the PM 's Private Office and the Duty Officerhad no instructions to pass it out
 - without clearance .
 - But how come ? The fault is entirely mine , Minister .
 The holding up of press releases dates back to before open government , and I unaccountably omitted to rescind it .
 - I hope you forgive this lapse .
 - Well , yes , of course . - That 's quite all right .
 - Thank you , Minister .
 Afterall , we all make mistakes .
 Yes , Minister .
