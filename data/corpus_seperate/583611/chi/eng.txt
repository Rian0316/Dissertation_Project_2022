 Sorry I 'm Iate . Did I miss anything ?
 Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos in his mouth . Fifteen ?
 Your personaI best !

 Where were you ?
 On a date .
 I met this girI on a train going to a museum upstate . - Which museum ?
 - How 'd you meet her ? No . Answer his .
 We were at the back of the train .
 I sat near the door so she 'd have to pass by me . . . . . . if she wanted to switch cars .
 She was totaIly at my mercy .
 Were you so Iate because you were burying this woman ? I 'm Iate because she Iives in Poughkeepsie .
 She seems great , but she 's two and a half hours away .
 How can she be great if she 's from Poughkeepsie ?
 That joke would have kiIled in Albany . Done ! I did it .
 Who 's stupid now ?

 Look !
 They 're Iighting the big Christmas tree tonight .
 That paper is two weeks old .
 Who keeps Ieaving old newspapers in the trash ?
 I reaIly wanted to take Kathy to this .
 At Ieast you have somebody to miss stuff with .
 I hate being alone this time of year .
 Next it 's Valentine 's Day . . . . . . then my birthday , then bang !
 Then they 're Iighting that damn tree again .
 I want somebody !
 You know , I want a man ! It doesn 't even have to be a big relationship .
 Just a fling ! I didn 't think girls ever just wanted a fling .
 Let me teII you , it 's been a Iong time since I 've been flung .
 I know what I 'm giving you for Christmas .
 There are nice guys in my office .
 Want me to set you up ?
 I 've been single a Iong time . Why haven 't you offered before ?
 I have a girlfriend . I 'm happy .
 I no Ionger go out of my way to stop others from being happy .
 No accountants .
 And no one from " Iegal . " I don 't Iike boring jobs .
 And Ross was what ? A Iion tamer ?

 What 's wrong , Mon ? Everybody at work stiII hates me .
 I was making headway .
 Everyone was smiling at me , and then I get off work . . . . . . and find out they wrote this on my chef 's hat .

 Maybe they meant to write " Quiet , Bitch . "
 What 's the matter ? Fine !
 Just trying to be nice . I haven 't been picked on this much since kindergarten .
 And they brought in someone from junior high to do the see- saw with me .
 They 're trying to make me quit .
 If it were any other job , I would .
 But I 've waited for this my whole Iife . Wait , you 're the boss .
 YeII at them . Or fire them !
 I would love to , but I can 't . I 'm not good at confrontation . You know what you can do ?
 I read about this director , Orson WeIles . . . . . . who , at the beginning , would hire somebody just to fire them .
 Then they would aII know who was boss .
 I 'm not doing anything .
 Why not fire me ? It 's a good idea .
 Can you waiter ? Good enough to get fired .

 AII right . You 're hired !
 That 's why I got fired Iast week !
 Does Orson WeIles direct commercials ?




 I say , Drew ?
 Are you seeing anybody right now ?
 I 'm not asking for me . I 'm not gay .
 I 'm not asking you out . I 'm not gay . I didn 't think you were gay .
 I do now .
 My friend , Rachel , wants to be set up . I just got out of a big relationship .
 I 'm not Iooking to get serious . That 's okay . A fling might be aII right with her .
 Is this " Hot Rachel " that you took to the Christmas Party ?
 By the way , that is her fuII name . Wow ! I 'm free for her .
 Wait , I didn 't say I wasn 't free .
 Let 's talk it over at the Ranger game . Hold on .
 I just got a box of Cubans . I 'II bring them by your office at five .
 That 's a Iittle Iater than I usuaIly stay , but sure .
 Before the game , we could enjoy some eight- year- old BasiI Haydens .
 I don 't know what that is , but Iet 's !

 I 'm writing a holiday song for everyone .
 Do you want to hear it ?
 Happy Hanukkah , Monica
 May your Christmas be snowy , Joey
 Happy New Year , Chandler and Ross
 Spin the dreidel , Rachel Pheebs , that 's great !
 But you know , RacheI doesn 't rhyme with dreidel .
 I know , but it 's so hard .
 Nothing rhymes with your stupid name !
 What are you talking about ? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel :
 Bagel , mail , jail , bail , cable .
 Maypole . AII good . Thanks .
 Do you , maybe , have a nickname that 's easier to rhyme ? Didn 't your dad used to caII you " Pumpkin " ?
 But did he ever caII you " Budolph " ?
 HeIlo , children .
 Have I got the 50 guys for you !
 I showed them your picture . Guys are throwing themselves at me and giving me stuff .
 - Knicks tonight ? - Where are the seats ? Wherever !
 I 've got 20 .
 WiII I Iike any of these guys ?
 You know , I 'm going to . . . . . . play the field a Iittle bit more .
 Guys are signing over their 401 Ks to me .
 You work with robots ?

 One guy , Patrick , you 'II Iike him .
 He 's nice , funny and a swimmer . I Iike swimmers ' bodies .
 His dad made the magnetic strip on credit cards .
 I Iike credit cards !
 I 'm not bad at this !
 - What does he do ? - He works in fine foods .
 - You have a fine foods division ?
 - It 's a big company . . . . Now , wait a second . You make food and robots ?
 No , the robots just work for them .
 AII right , I 'm going to work . Does anybody have a problem with that ?
 Yeah , Iady . I do !
 I got a problem !
 I 'II give you a problem ! What wiII you do ?
 Fire me ?
 You bet your ass I 'II fire you !
 See you Iater . I should go .
 I 've got a date .
 With who ?
 You know the girI who Iives in Poughkeepsie ?
 Not her .
 This is someone else .
 I can 't decide between the two .
 The one from Poughkeepsie , though two hours away , is pretty . . . . . . reaIly smart and a Iot of fun . But this other girl , she Iives right uptown .

 She 's just as pretty .
 I guess she 's smart .
 She 's not fun .
 If she 's no fun , why date her at aIl ? I want to give her a chance . She Iives so close .
 And , at the end of the date , she said something that . . . . . . if she was kidding , was very funny .
 If she wasn 't kidding , she 's not fun .
 She 's stupid and racist .
 How was your first day at the restaurant ?
 Damn !

 What happened to your fancy jacket ? They baked it .
 I can 't take this anymore . - I 'm going to fire you tonight . - You got it .
 What are you doing ?
 You 're stiII on fire there . I think you got it !
 Chandler , you have the best taste in men .
 Like father , Iike son .
 Patrick and I had such a great time Iast night !
 This could , maybe , get serious .
 I thought you weren 't Iooking for serious .
 Just a fling ?
 WeIl , you know , possibly .

 You didn 't teII him that , though , right ?
 You told this guy that I was Iooking for a fling ?
 - You don 't teII him that ! - Why not ? I 'd be thriIled if some hot girl --
 I see .
 You teIling him I want a fling and me putting out . . . . . . he 's so going to get the wrong idea !
 Joey , could you pass the cheese ?
 I 'd prefer you didn 't caII me Joey .
 I thought it might be fun to try out a cooI nickname .
 Hey , Dragon ! Here 's your tips from Monday and Tuesday .
 There 's $300 in this one .
 People get generous around the holidays .
 And it never hurts to wear tight trousers .
 Could the waiters Iisten to the specials ?
 There 's Chilean sea bass with a mango relish -- Why is nobody writing these ? We can remember them .
 Because you 'II make up fake specials and make me cook them ? Sure , that too .
 Forget the specials for a minute .
 Here 's the thing . . . .
 For the Iast two weeks I have . . .
 . . . tried hard to create a positive atmosphere .
 Can 't hear you !
 Positive atmosphere . But I 've had it up to here .
 From now on , it is going to be my way . . . . . . or the highway .
 AII right ?
 Does anybody have a problem with that ?


 Hey , new guy .
 I said , does anybody have a problem with that ?
 No , ma 'am .
 He has a name . It 's Dragon .
 You want to know your name ?
 Check your hat . We did the hat , right ?
 - What the heII just happened ?
 - I am so sorry .
 I was going to do it .
 But I was standing there with $327 in one hand . . . . . . and $238 in the other .
 And I was thinking . . . . . . it 's been a Iong time since I had . . . . . . $327 plus $238 !
 We had a deal !
 It 's why you 're here . I 've got to fire you !
 And I got to pay rent !
 How about you don 't fire me . Instead , I stay . I gain their trust .
 They 'II Iisten to the nice things I say about you .
 What nice things ?
 Nothing yet .
 They hate you , and I want to fit in . Happy Hannukah , Chandler and Monica Merry , merry --
 You know what , Pheebs ? I 'm not Jewish so . . . .
 Ross doesn 't decorate his tree with floss . . . . . . but he 's not complaining .

 Bad dream ?
 I wasn 't sleeping .
 What was Phoebe 's song about ?
 It 's the one with the cat .
 I got to go . I 've got another date .
 Did you pick one yet ? It turns out the one from uptown was making a joke .
 It was a different joke .
 It wasn 't that funny . So I 'm stiII torn . You don 't Iike the one from uptown .
 And you 're exhausted from dating Poughkeepsie .
 Just end them both !
 Go to Poughkeepsie and break up with her . Then break up with uptown .
 By the time you get home , you 're done !
 You 're right .
 Thank you .
 I had a similar problem when I Iived in Prague .
 - Prague ?
 - So much you don 't know .

 Patrick just ended things with me .
 Did you or didn 't you teII him I wanted a serious relationship ?
 I did ! I absolutely did !
 You idiot ! I 'm sure you 're right . But why ?
 You don 't teII a guy that you want a serious relationship .
 Now you scared him away !
 I am sorry .
 I am so sorry . You should never be aIlowed to talk to people !
 I know , I know !
 Now I 'm right back where I started .
 This sucks !
 Being alone sucks ! You 'II meet somebody .
 You 're a great catch !
 When I told those guys about you , I didn 't have to Iie once .
 ReaIly ?

 You graduated magna cum Iaude , right ?
 It doesn 't matter .
 I got tickets to the Ranger game .
 You want to come with me ?
 Cute guys in Iittle shorts ? Sure .
 ActuaIly , it 's a hockey team .
 Angry Canadians with no teeth .
 That sounds fun too .
 Thank you .
 Have you ever been with a woman ?
 What is the matter with you ?
 There is no good time to ask that question .

 The station is Poughkeepsie .
 Poughkeepsie !
 Ross ?
 Wake up !

 I need more swordfish .
 - Can you get me more swordfish ?
 - I don 't speak English . You just did .
 I don 't know what to teII you .
 Fine .


 Very funny . Let me out , please .
 Come on , I 'm cold !
 And covered in marinara sauce !
 Let me out !
 You found that handle , did you ?
 - It 's not funny .
 - WeIl , that 's not true . I 'm a good person .
 And I 'm a good chef .
 And I don 't deserve to have marinara sauce aII over me !
 If you want me to quit this bad then -- Chef GeIler ?
 You know that speech you made ? I got a problem with it ! - You do ?
 - You bet I do !
 I just wasn 't Iistening then , that 's aIl .
 If you want a problem , I 'II give you a problem !
 What are you going to do ? Fire me ? You bet I 'II fire you !
 Get out of my kitchen !
 Get out !
 AII right .
 Anybody else got a problem ?
 How about you , chuckles ? You think this is funny now ?
 What if I dance covered in sauce ?
 You think it 's funny ?
 No , it 's reaIly good .
 Take those salads to table four .
 And you , get the swordfish !
 And you !
 Get a haircut !
 Last stop , Montreal . The stop is Montreal !

 What ?

 I bet myself that you had beautifuI eyes .
 Now that I see them , I win !

 We 're at my stop . Would you Iike to have coffee ?
 Are we reaIly in Montreal ?
 Yes , we are . So coffee ? Coffee sounds great .
 Wait . So you Iive in Montreal ?
 No , but it 's only a two- hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia .
 I should have thought about my wife and kids . . . . . . before I talked back to Chef GeIler .
 It wiII be a Iean Christmas at the Dragon house this year .

 Enough !
 Lean , Iean , Iean !
 Went to the store Sat on Santa 's lap
