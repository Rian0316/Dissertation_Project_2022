 Studio stand by .
 We 'll talk about cuts in government extravagance , aren 'twe ?
 We 'll get to that if we 've got time afterthe National Data Base .
 I don 't think people are really interested in the Data Base .
 It 's so trivial .
 VTrunning .
 - What 's the matter ?
 - You look a bit too pink .
 We can 't have that , whatwould the Daily Telegraph say ?
 All those questions about " are we creating a police state ? "
 - We can do without those .
 - Jim , you knowme .
 I don 't give out my questions in advance .
 Dead silence , please .
 Ten seconds ...

 Good evening . Is Big Brotherwatching you ?
 To be more precise , the Government is building up a dossieron you .
 It 's called by the harmless name of" National Integrated Data Base " .
 At the press of a button any civil servant can inspect just about every detail of your life yourtax , yourmedical record , periods of unemployment , children 's school records , and that civil servant may happen to be yourneighbour .


 There 's been mounting concern overthis powerful , even totalitarian weapon that the computerrevolution has put into the Government 's hand .
 And the man who wields the weapon is the Minister forAdministrative Affairs , the Right Honourable James Hacker .
 Now , Minister , are we laying the foundations of a police state ?
 You know , I 'm glad you asked me that question .
 Well , Minister , could we have the answer ?
 Well , yes of course , I 'm about to give it to you , if I may .
 As I said , I 'm glad you asked me that question .
 Because ... it 's a question a lot of people are asking .

 And why ? Because a lot of people want to know the answerto it .
 And let 's be quite clearabout this without beating about the bush , the plain fact of the matter is that it 's a very important question indeed and people have a right to know .

 But Minister , we haven 't yet had the answer .
 I 'm sorry , whatwas the question ?
 Now look , supposing I annoy you in this interview , how do I know you won 't go back to youroffice , press a button and call up my tax records , my hospital records , my police record ...




 Oh no . No . No .
 Bob , that 's not the way we do things in this country .
 What 's the Data Base for if it 's not to check up on people ?
 You know , that 's a very interesting question .
 It 's forstoring information so as to speed up government business so thatwe need not take on an enormous influx of clerical staff .
 Computers are big business and are good news .
 But , Minister , if you put information into the machine , you 'll eventually take information out of the machine .
 Not necessarily .
 So , you 're going to spend 25 million pounds accumulating information and neveruse it ?
 No .
 Yes .
 No . Well , there will be safeguards .


 Such as ? Close in on him , Two .
 Bob 's got him on the run .
 One minute 45 , studio . We 'll be looking at a whole range of possibilities .
 And of course , it 's a complex and highly technical matter .
 Rome wasn 't built in a day .

 It 's underreview . And of course , these things take time .
 Minister , am I talking to the formereditorof Reform orto a Civil Service spokesman ?
 We haven 't talked about the safeguards I 've introduced .
 And there 's my newbureaucratic watchdog office , for instance .
 It does look as if we 'll need a whole pack of watchdogs before long .
 But thank you very much . Right , hold it there while we check the tape .
 - How did it go ?
 - Well , I thought ... First class .
 - Very good indeed .
 - I thought I waffled a bit . Oh no , you stonewalled superbly , Minister .


 Time fora drink ?
 About the safeguards I 've introduced .
 My newbureaucratic watchdog office , for instance .
 It sounds as if we 'll need a pack of watchdogs before very long .
 But thank you very much .
 In next week 's topic ...
 - Howwas I ?
 - Splendid , Minister .
 Very dignified .
 Very suitable .
 Yes , Sir Humphrey , I congratulate you .
 Jim is nowperfectly house trained .
 He does exactly what you tell him .
 - If you 'll excuse me , Mr. Weasel .
 - Weisel .
 You say everything the Civil Service programmes you to say .
 What are you a man ora mouth ?
 Very amusing , Frank .
 It might be hard fora Political Advisorto understand this , but I am merely a Civil Servant ,
 I simply do as I am instructed by my master .
 If the Minister 's a woman what do you call her ?
 Yes , that 's rather interesting .
 We sought an answer when I was Principal Private Secretary and Dr. Edith Summerskill , as she then was , was appointed Minister in 1947 .

 I didn 't quite like to refer to heras my Mistress .
 - Whatwas the answer ?
 - We 're still waiting for it . It 's underreview , is it ?
 Rome wasn 't built in a day .
 - These things take time .
 - I must be going .
 - Me too .
 - May I remind you we meet tomorrowmorning at Paddington at 8 ?
 - Where are we going ?
 - Swansea , Minister . You 're addressing the Conference of Municipal Treasurers .

 Oh , yes . You 're due in Newcastle to address the by election meeting .

 - So I am .
 - You can 't do both .
 - I can 't do both .
 - That 's a Civil Service junket .
 - The by election 's important .
 - It 's important . The Conference is in yourdiary .
 They expect you in Swansea .
 They expects you in Newcastle .
 - How come he 's double booked ?
 - How come I 'm double booked ? Well , largely because nobody told me about Newcastle .

 - Why didn 't you tell him ?
 - Why didn 't you ?
 I can 't remembereverything . Frank , I think I 'd bettergo to Swansea .
 - Is that a decision ?
 - Yes , that 's final .
 The P. M. Expects you to go to Newcastle .

 The P. M ? I think I 'd bettergo to Newcastle , Bernard .
 - Is that a decision , Jim ?
 - Yes , that 's final .
 - Now I 'm going home .
 - Is that a decision ?
 No , quite seriously ... I think you 've made the wrong decision .
 Yourvisit to Swansea 's been announced .
 - You can 't get out of it .
 - Oh , Lord ! Find a way of getting me from Swansea to Newcastle .
 Car , train , helicopter , anything .
 I 'll have to do both . And now I 'm going home , and that is final !
 - Finallyfinal ?
 - Absolutelyfinally . If you could do all yourboxes tonight .
 There 's all the M& A Committee papers and all the letters .
 And if you 're a good boy , you 'll get a sweetie .
 Good .

 Hello , darling . - Thanks , George .

 Goodnight .
 - Goodnight , sir .
 - Hello , darling .
 - Hello .

 Leaving me at last ?
 It 's ouranniversary tomorrow , have you forgotten ?
 No , of course I haven 't forgotten .
 We 're going to Paris .
 Oh , my God !
 - You had forgotten .
 - No , I hadn 't . No , it 's just that I ...

 I didn 't ...
 I 'm double ...
 - I 'm going to Swansea tomorrow .
 - Swansea ?
 And Newcastle .
 I don 'twant to go there formy anniversary .
 No .
 Not you . Just me .
 - Cancel them !
 - I can 't .

 What are you doing ?

 Cancel them !
 We booked this three months ago .
 - I can 't .
 - Then I 'll go to Paris without you .
 Hello , Bernard ...
 Yes , it 's me ...
 I 'm going to have to cancel tomorrow . Swansea and Newcastle .
 It 's my wife 's wedding anniversary tomorrow ...
 It 's yours too ! Yeah , and mine too actually .

 Yes , it is .
 Coincidence ?
 Don 't be silly . Anyway , I 'm going to Paris tomorrow and that 's final .
 Yes , I said that before , but this time is final !
 You 'll just have to cope as best as you can .
 Yes ? Yes ... definitely ...
 Yes ...
 Is that clear ?
 Right !
 We 're going to Paris . No , I 'm going to Swansea and Newcastle .
 - See me on TV tonight ?
 - I saw somebody who looked like you .
 - What 's that meant to mean ?
 - Nothing . Frank says I 've become a Civil Service mouthpiece .



 - Yes .
 - What do you mean , yes ?
 - Well ... yes .
 - You mean you agree ?
 - Of course .
 - What do you mean , of course ? You could have hired and actor to say it all foryou .
 And why not just sign your letters with a rubberstamp ?
 Orget an Assistant Principal to sign them foryou .
 They write them anyway . Assistant Principals do notwrite my letters !
 UnderSecretaries do that .
 I rest my case , my lord . - You think I 've become a puppet ?

 - Yes , I do . Get Miss Piggy to do yourjob .

 She 's prettier .
 I don 't knowwhat to do .
 I 'm just swamped by the work . Oh , Annie , I 'm so depressed .
 As we 're not going to Paris ,
 let 's at least go out fora quiet little dinnertonight .
 No , I can 't . Bernard 's told me to get through three boxes .

 What do you mean , Bernard 's told you ?
 When you edited " Reform " you were quite different .
 You went in , you told people what to do , and you got what you wanted !
 Eitheryou get them by the throat orthey get you by the throat !
 Howmany articles did you tearup in those days ?
 - Dozens .
 - And howmany official papers ?
 - I 'm not allowed to !
 - Not allowed to ? Darling , you 're the Minister , you can do anything you like .
 No , Humphrey , I 've decided that Frank was right .
 And Bob McKenzie too . The National Data Base has got to be organised differently .

 Yes , Minister .
 We want all possible built in safeguards .
 - Yes , Minister .
 - Right away .
 What precisely do you mean , right away ?
 I mean right away .
 I see , you mean right away ?
 - Got it in one , Humphrey .
 - Well , Minister ... We are still in the early months of this Government .

 And there 's an awful lot to get ...
 The Data Base rules have got to be changed .
 Now ! - But you can 't , Minister .
 - Yes , I can , I 'm the Minister .
 Yes , indeed you are , Minister . And quite an excellent Ministerat that .
 Nevermind the soft soap , Humphrey .
 I want all citizens to have a right to see theirown files and I want legislation to make unauthorised access , illegal .
 - Very well .
 It shall be done .
 - Good .
 But the legislation necessary to give the public the right to take legal action is extremely complicated and would take considerable time to draft , promulgate and enact .
 Legislation isn 't necessaryfora citizen to see his own files , is it ?
 - No ...
 - Then , we 'll startwith that .
 I suppose we could manage that slightly quicker , but there 's an awful lot of administrative problems as well .
 This must have been examined before . The Data Base has been in preparation foryears .
 There must have been discussions about it .
 - Yes , indeed .
 - What conclusions were reached ?

 Humphrey , what conclusions were reached ?
 What did my predecessor want to do about it ?
 Humphrey , can you hearme ?
 My lips are sealed .

 I beg yourpardon ? I am not at liberty to reveal previous plans , Minister .


 Why not ?
 Would you like everything that you have said in this office to be revealed subsequently to one of youropponents ?

 I see . No . We cannot give youropponents political ammunition against you .
 But Tom Sargent was my predecessor .
 It isn 't a party political mattersurely ?
 It 's a matterof principle .
 It justwouldn 't be ...
 I see and we don 'twant to do anything thatwouldn 't be ...
 No .

 - Oh , excuse me , Minister .
 - Yes , Bernard ?
 A slight problem , Minister .
 Because of the adverse ... not entirelyfavourable press reaction to your interview , the otherChannel wants you fortheirprogramme .


 - Say no .
 - No ?
 - Yes , no .
 - Yes no ? - Yes , say no !

 That 's final .
 - If that 's what you want .
 But they would go ahead with the item and nobody would be there to state yourcase .
 No ?
 Okay , yes .
 No , okay , yes ...
 - Oh , I see what you mean .
 - Yes .
 Finallyfinal ?
 Thank you , Bernard .

 What am I going to tell them about safeguards .
 Humphrey ?
 Perhaps you could remind them , Minister , that Rome wasn 't built in a day ?

 Tom .
 - Oh , my dearfellow .
 - Mind if I join you ?
 No , of course not .
 Well , how are you enjoying being in opposition ?
 How are you enjoying being in Government ?
 Well , not as much as I expected , actually .
 - Well , not at the moment .
 - Humphrey got you undercontrol ?
 It 's so hard to get things done .
 - Did you manage to get things done ?
 - Oh , almost nothing . When I did cotton on to his technique , there was the election .
 - Technique ?
 - Stalling technique .
 - Stalling technique ?
 - It comes in five stages . First , he 'll tell you there 's lots of things to be getting on with .
 - He told me that this morning .
 - Quite . Then , if you still persist , he 'll say something like
 " Ah , yes , Minister , I quite appreciate the intention , certainly something ought to be done , but are you sure this is the rightway to achieve it ? " .
 I must make a note of this .
 Now , if you are still undeterred , he will shift his ground .
 He will shift from telling you how to do it to when you should do it .
 I mean , he 'll say , " Now , Minister , this is not the right time , forall sorts of reasons " .

 - And Ministers settle forthat ?
 - Well , lots do .
 And if you don 't , he 'll say that the policy" has run into difficulties " .
 - Such as ? - Technical , political , legal ...
 Legal are the best sort .
 He can make those totally incomprehensible .
 And with any luck , this technique will have lasted forthree years and you 'll be at the final stage when he says :
 " We 're getting very close to the next general election .
 Are you sure you can get this policy through ? "
 Howhas it taken three years ?
 Sir Humphrey will do absolutely nothing unless you chase him .
 And you 've got fartoo much to do . You see , it 's what they call " creative inertia " .

 What 's the policy you 're trying to get through anyway ?
 I 'm trying to make this National Integrated Data Base a bit less of a Big Brother .
 Oh , is that what it is ?
 - He 's told you it 's all quite new ?
 - Well , yes .
 My dearfellow , we spent years on that . We had a White Paper when they called election .
 I 've done it all .
 - And administrative problems ?
 - I 've solved them .
 And you couldn 't see any of the previous papers ?
 No wonder .
 He 's wiped the slate clean .

 D 'you knowwhat his next move 's gonna be ?
 - No .
 - Howmany boxes have you got ?
 - Three ?
 Four ? - Five .
 Did he tell you not to worry about the fifth one ?
 - Yes .
 - Right .
 I 'll take a bet .
 You will find at the bottom of the fifth box a memo which explains exactly why any newmoves on the Data Base must be delayed .
 If you don 't find it , he won 't do anotherblind thing , but in six month 's time he 'll say that he has told you all about it .
 Tom , you were in office foryears .
 You know all the Civil Service tricks .
 Not all , old boy .
 Just a fewhundred .
 And how do you make them do something they don 'twant to do ?
 My dearfellow , if I knew that I wouldn 't be in Opposition .
 But I don 't get it .
 Tom 's the opposition .
 Why did he tell you all this ?
 - The Opposition aren 't the opposition .
 - Of course not . Silly of me .
 - They are called that .
 - They 're the opposition in exile . The Civil Service are the Opposition in residence .
 Now then , bottom of the fifth box , Tom said .
 But you can 't really do anything .
 Oh , can 't I ? Tom 's given me all his papers on the Data Base .
 Three year 's worth !
 Marvellous !
 Found it .
 It had slipped into an 80 page report on Welfare procedures .
 " Safeguards still underdiscussion ... programme not finalised ... nothing precipitate ... failing instructions to the contrary , propose await developments " .


 Typical ! - Ring Humphrey and tell him .
 - I 'll see him first thing .
 - Ring him now !
 - It 's two o 'clock .
 - He 'll be fast asleep .
 - Exactly !

 Annie .
 Why should he be asleep and you 're still working ?
 He 's had you on the run .
 Now it 's yourturn . I couldn 't do that .

 What 's his number ?
 Itwas in the fifth box , you couldn 't have got to it earlier .
 True .


 Yes ? Humphrey , sorry to ring you so late .

 I didn 't interrupt you in the middle of dinner , did I ?
 No , we finished dinner some while ago .
 - Oh , good .
 - What 's the time ?
 Er , two a . m . - Good God , what 's the crisis ?


 - No . No crisis .
 I 'm going through my boxes , and I knew you 'd still be hard at it .
 Oh , yes , yes , yes , yes .
 Nose to the grindstone . Well , I 've just come across this Data Base paper .
 Oh , you 've found ... you 've read it !
 Thought I 'd bettertell you I 'm not happy with it .
 You 'll welcome an opportunity to work on something else .
 - You didn 't mind my calling you ?
 - No .
 Not at all Minister .
 Always a pleasure to hearfrom you .
 I meant to tell him to see me about it before Cabinet .
 Don 't ring him now . You 're right , it is a bit late .
 Give him anotherten minutes .
 If you could be fairly quick .
 - He does have Cabinet at 10 .
 - I can be very quick . The word " No " is one of the shortest in the language .
 Sorry to be so late .
 Lots of reading to do this morning .
 Good morning , Bernard .
 Thank you , George .
 Now , Humphrey , the Data Base .
 Have you drafted yoursafeguards ?
 Well , Minister , I quite appreciate your intention and fully agree that there is need forsafeguards , but is this
 - the rightway to achieve it ?
 - Well , it 's my way .
 One .
 That 's my decision , anyway .
 Well this is not really the time forall sorts of reasons .
 Two .
 It 's the perfect time .
 Safeguards should be developed alongside systems , that 's common sense .
 We tried all this before and we ran into all sorts of difficulties .
 Three .

 Such as ? - Well , technical , for instance .


 - No . No problems .
 We can use the same basicfile interrogation programme as the U. S. State Dept .
 And the Swedish Ministry of the Interior .
 No problems there . Yes , but there are also formidable administrative problems .
 And all departments are affected .
 - An interdepartmental committee ...
 - No .
 No . No , Humphrey . You 'll find that the existing security procedures are adequate .

 This is simply an extension .
 Anything more ?
 - Well , yes , Minister .
 - Legal problems , forexample ?
 - Yes , Minister .
 - Good , good .
 - Do we have the legal power ?
 - I 'll answer it .
 We have . All personnel affected are bound by theirstaff agreements .
 Yes , but Minister , there will be a need forextra staffing .
 Will you be able to get it through the parliamentary party ?
 Yes , I 'm quite sure .
 Anything further ?
 I don 't think so .
 We can go ahead then .
 You 're very silent .
 You don 't seem to realise the amount of work that 's involved .
 Haven 't you examined safeguards before ?
 Underanothergovernment ? I remembersome written answers to parliamentary questions .

 Well , in the first place as we 've agreed that question is not ...
 In the second place , if there had been investigations , which there haven 't ornot necessarily , orl am not at liberty to say whetherthere have , there would have been a project team , which , had it existed , on which I cannot comment , which would nowhave disbanded if it had existed and the members returned to do theirdepartments , if indeed there had been any such members .





 Ornot as the case may be .
 - Quite so , Minister .
 - I want these safeguards made available immediately .
 - Minister , it is not possible .
 - It is .
 - It isn 't . - It is .
 - It isn 't .
 - It is . - It isn 't .
 - 'Tis , 'tis , 'tis , 'tis , 'tis , 'tis .
 Just to remind you , you have Cabinet at 10 . 00 , the Anglo American Society at one , and the " World in Focus " interview , this evening .

 - Can 't you get me out of the lunch ?
 - It 's been announced .
 I see ...
 I suppose I ...
 - What 's that you just said ?
 - We can 't get out of it .
 It 's been announced , it 's in the programme .
 Thank you , Bernard . Thank you very much .

 Forwhat , Minister ?
 Foreverything , Bernard .

 And our Man on the Spot tonight is the Right HonourableJim Hacker ,
 MinisterforAdministrative Affairs , the man at the heart of the Big Brothercomputercontroversy .
 He 's talking to Godfrey Finch .
 Minister , as you know there 's been an outcry this week about the dossierthat the Civil Service bureaucracy has apparently been building up on every citizen in this country .
 Now , it 's rumoured that this is not in fact , yourown policy , that you 'd like to have safeguards forthe individual citizen , but that you are being totally frustrated at every stage of the game by the Civil Service machine .

 You know , Godfrey , there 's a lot of nonsence talked about the Civil Service .
 It 's a marvellous , efficient , professional organisation , capable of enormous energy and speed .
 It 's staffed by a lot of talented , dedicated people who do everything in theirpower to help the Government make it 's policies into law .
 Well , thank you forthe commercial , Minister .
 Perhaps we can start the programme now ?
 The fact of the matter is that the Civil Service and I are in complete accord overthis whole business and I 'm happy to announce that we 're nowready to put ourproposals into publication .
 In fact , tonight I can say that from Septemberthe first , every citizen of the U. K. Will have the absolute right to inspect his personal file and check any information that he has eversupplied to the Government .


 Secondly , no civil servant will be allowed to examine personal files from anotherdepartment , without written authorityfrom a Minister .
 And I shall be announcing in the House next week legislation enabling citizens to take legal action against any civil servant who gains unauthorised access to his file .
 Encouraging , Minister .
 Why did you not say so first , and put people 's minds at rest ?
 I didn 't believe that the Civil Service could meet ourdeadlines .
 But they 've convinced me that they can .
 And , in fact , my Permanent Secretary has staked his reputation on it .
 And if not , heads will roll ...
 Anyway , Assistant Heads .
 Thank you very much , Minister .
 - It can 't be done .
 - It 's been announced on TV .
 Bernard , what did you make of our Minister 's performance ?
 Well , I ... I think it 's check mate , Sir Humphrey .

 See me on the box last night , Humphrey ?
 Of course , Minister .
 Howwas I ?
 Good ?
 A most remarkable performance , Minister , if I may say so .
 - You may , you may .
 - Thank you , Minister .
 We have been working very hard all night , and I 'm happy to be able to tell you thatwe have come up with some draft proposals which would enable you to achieve yourdesired objectives by the stated dates .


 Well done .
 I told the nation how splendid you were and I was right .
 - I had every confidence in you .
 - Quite so , Minister .
 You must have had quite a night . - Yes , Minister , quite a night !
 - Let 's see yourproposals .
 Here they are .
 And here are mine .

 You have specific proposals too ?
 Oh , indeed I have .
 Now , Humphrey , you read out what you 've got on safeguards , and I 'll read out what I 've got and we 'll see how they compare .

 " Personal data 1A :
 Safeguards must be applied with reference to ...
 Two criteria . The need to know and the right to know .
 1A1 .

 The need to know only those officials ... forwhom the information was submitted may be deemed , prime facie , to have a need to know .
 We seem to be of the same mind , Humphrey .
 Indeed , Minister .

 Where did those proposals come from ?

 Minister ?
 Can you hearme ?
 Where did those proposals come from ?
 Humphrey , my lips are sealed .
