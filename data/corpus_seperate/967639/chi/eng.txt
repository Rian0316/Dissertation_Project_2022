 My back . I threw it out .
 Jeez , are you crying ?
 Just a little .

 Remember my little boy ?
 I didn 't know your son was coming for a visit .
 His father just dumped him here for four weeks .

 Have you not noticed ? I 'm a catch .
 I have noticed , and I 'm throwing you back .


 Will you be my wife ?
 Yes !
 God , I 'm so nervous .
 Don 't be .
 They 're going to adore you as much as I do .
 Oh , thanks . I needed to hear to that .
 Ah ! Darling ... thorns .
 Oh ! Uh , I 'm so sorry .



 Oh ! Here they come .

 - Father . - My dear boy .
 This is my fianc\ xE9e Susan .
 These are my parents , Graham and Dahlia .
 Delighted .
 You weren 't exaggerating . She 's a vision , Ian .
 Oh , it 's so great to finally meet both of you .
 Oh , this is for you .
 Be careful , mother !
 Thorns .
 I just didn 't want Susan to ... you 're right . Ian , I know how to hold a rose .
 Yes , of cour -- of course .
 Sorry .
 Anyone hungry ?
 Yes .
 So one puts the meat atop the burning coals , oh , how wonderfully primal .
 Yes , I 'll feel like some gloriously rough- hewn cowgirl enjoying her ... uh , what 's the word ?
 " Vittles " ?
 No , that can 't be right .
 No , it is . It 's vittles .
 Yes .
 So , um , can I get you something to drink ?
 I 'd adore just a thimble of gin .
 Oh , no , you stay , darling .
 I- I- I can manage .
 Well , it seems to be going rather well ...
 Touch wood .
 Were you worried ?
 Oh , you know , introducing one 's fianc\ xE9e to one 's parents is always a bit fraught .
 Oh , well , you don 't have to tell me .
 The first time I met Dahlia 's parents was a complete disaster .
 We were at tea ... and there was this plate of small cakes .
 And I -- as I offered one to her mother , I tipped the plate , and plop ! a scone fell right into Her Ladyship 's teacup .
 Ouch ! Ha !
 Earl Grey everywhere !
 On the cloth , her mother 's skirt ... you must have been mortified .
 Oh , I was . It was an absolute debacle .
 Um , guys ?
 Uh ... don 't worry .
 She 's all right .





 I can 't believe you bought another bustier .
 I know .
 I should never shop for lingerie when I 'm horny .
 It 's like buying groceries when you 're hungry .
 In a slump , huh ?
 How long 's it been ?
 About three weeks , and I am dying .
 You know , I 'm this close to seducing my gardener .
 Been there , done that .
 Mmm , that scrumptious teenager of yours .
 - Hey , do you think -- - He 's married .
 Mm , damn .
 How about that Victor Lang ?
 - Have you two ... - No . God , no .
 As a matter of fact , I think I ' m dumping him after dinner tonight .
 Why ?
 He 's rich . He 's gorgeous .
 He 's probably gonna be mayor .
 I mean , what more do youant ?
 I don 't know . He 's just too ... arrogant .
 He acts like I 'm some trophy he 's already won .
 It 's infuriating .
 Yeah , that 's awful .
 Can I do him ?
 Oh , stop it .
 You cannot be that hard up .
 Did I mention my gardener 's 62 ?
 What the hell is this ?
 Oh , my God !
 No !
 Hey , hey , hey !
 Hey , hey , hey !
 Honey , where 's your uniform ?
 Oh , crap . I left it at home again .
 Yeah , um , I figured you would ... again .
 That 's why ...
 I pulled an extra one from the back .
 Oh . Thanks .
 - Are you sure it 's the right - - Yep , your size .
 Listen ...
 I was thinking , wouldn 't it be better if the staff wore a uniform , and you and I wore regular clothes ?
 That 's way it 's like , " Hi . Welcome to Scavo 's .
 We 're the Scavos . "
 Yeah , but I like wearing the uniform , and when you don 't , it looks like we all work for you .
 Oh , good point .
 Okay , here 's another good point -- I hate orange .
 Since when ?
 Since always .
 You know my closet .
 Surely you 've noticed I don 't own anything orange .
 - No , I hadn 't really -- - Orange says , " Beware . Something bad 's gonna happen . "
 That 's why they use it for life vests and traffic cones and convicts .
 - Lynette -- - Also , it washes me out completely .
 You 're wearing the uniform .
 Are you speaking as my husband or as my boss ?
 Definitely your boss .
 Your husband -- too damn scared of you .
 As well he should be .

 Pass it to me , Carlos !

 - Hi ! - Hey .
 Did you see that , Edie ?
 Kid 's looking good , huh ?
 Mmm , looking real good .
 Can we play another game ?
 No , it 's lunchtime .
 You go wash up .
 - Bye , Carlos . - Bye .
 Oh , you have been so great with Travers .
 Let me take you out for steak tonight .
 You don 't have to pay me back .
 I 'm having more fun than he is .
 Well , then ...
 We 'll just have to arrange for another playdate .
 Anytime .
 Look who 's back .
 Yes . Let 's try this again , shall we ?
 - Dahlia , I am so sorry about the -- - Please , not another word .
 Chiffon at a barbecue ?
 I was asking to be immolated .
 A drink with dinner , mother ?
 Oh , God , yes .
 Oh , not that chair . That 's the wobbler .
 I 'm saving up for a new set .
 Here , sit here .
 Ian tells us you have a young daughter .
 Won 't she be joining us ?
 Julie ? Uh , no , she 's at her father 's this weekend .
 Oh . Is something wrong ?
 Oh , it 's just that Ian told us that your husband had been gone for years .
 We assumed you were a widow .
 Oh ! no , Karl 's alive and kicking ... sadly .
 So you 're a ... divorc\ xE9e ?
 What happened ?
 Did he beat you ?
 Uh , no . Of -- of course not .
 She had ample grounds , mother .
 Karl was a shameless womanizer .
 So it was just adultery .
 Just adultery ?
 To my way of thinking , men are , by nature , weak .
 I think Graham will back me up on that .
 Really , Dahlia .
 If you want your marriage to last ... when your husband strays , you extract some suitable penance ... and get on with it .

 Punish the sin , but love the sinner .
 Yeah , well , with Karl , I was more ,
 " Divorce the ass and seize the assets . "
 So you better watch out .
 Betrayal makes me vengeful .
 Well , that 's good to know .
 Yes , it certainly is .
 Apparently , the water heater in the attic had burst .
 Everything is ruined -- my clothes , my shoes , dresses . Why are you smiling ?
 Well , we have different perspectives .
 You see ruined clothes , and I see a woman who could suddenly use a rich boyfriend .
 You will never be my boyfriend .
 Gaby , how much longer are you gonna pretend you 're not crazy about me ? Not much longer .
 This is our last date .
 Hmm , didn 't you say it was our last date on our last date ? I mean it this time .
 Yeah ?
 Well , do me a favor -- mean it next time .
 I 'm getting an award tomorrow at the rotary club . Bor- ing .
 Come on , I want my date to be the most beautiful woman in the room .
 Is that supposed to flatter me ?
 Only if you 've never seen the women of the rotary club .
 Oh , shut up and get me a sweater . Have you even noticed how cold I am ?
 Noticed ?
 It 's made my whole evening .

 Sweater -- now .
 How about a nice , uh , cashmere cardigan ?
 Oh , my God ! What ?
 Look at this !
 There 's Lacroix and Ungaro and vintage Gaultier .
 Yeah , I don 't really know much about fashion .
 Shh ! they can hear you . Oh , my God !
 There 's another rack back here !
 This all your ex- wife 's stuff ? Yeah .
 She 's storing it here until her new house is ready .
 Oh , my God !
 She wears my size !
 It 's amazing .
 Nobody wears my size . Well , I guess I have a type .
 And normally that would creep me out , except it means that I can borrow this one- of- a- kind undari for our date !
 Whoa , whoa , whoa .
 Heel , girl .
 - This belongs to my ex . - So ?
 I don 't think she 'd appreciate me loaning her clothes to my girlfriend .
 Okay , ( a ) I 'm not your girlfriend , and ( b ) she 's not gonna find out unless you tell her .
 Come on !
 A dress this gorgeous is meant to be seen .
 Every day it hangs in the closet , an angel loses its wings .
 Well , that 's very cute , but , uh , the answer 's still no . Come on .
 Let 's go .
 Gaby .
 I just wanted a moment to say good- bye .
 So in the next scene , the guy wakes up , and the girl -- Julia Roberts , Sandra Bullock , one of those -- is standing there holding a tray of pancakes .
 What happens then ? I keep telling you , I don 't remember .
 What 's the difference ?
 It 's just some stupid movie I saw .
 Yet every time you remember it , you feel sad or upset .
 I think something happened at that movie or just afterwards . Who did you see it with ?
 Well , it 's obviously some chick flick ... so probably Susan .
 Well , why not ask her about it ?
 Maybe she can tell you what happened .
 No .
 No , I don 't want to bother her .
 She just got engaged .
 Mike , this therapy isn 't just about recovering your memories . It 's about you getting closure .
 Now the emotions you 're feeling won 't be resolved until you know whathey 're about .
 I don 't know . Come on .
 Talk to Susan . What could it hurt ?

 That 's awesome .
 I love model airplanes . - So you 'll help me put it together ?
 - Sure . I 'll see you tomorrow after school .
 Can you come at 7 : 00 instead ?
 Why so late ?
 Mom says I can 't play till I finish my homework .
 Bye . He 's coming .
 So can I stay up and watch my show now ?
 You can stay up as late as you want , champ .
 Tomorrow ... you are going to have an early night .
 your father 's been up there 20 minutes . - Are you sure he 's ok ?
 - He 's fine . He always lies down after dinner .
 He says it helps his digestion .
 Relax . It 's going very well . I set your mother on fire .
 And you 've been relentlessly charming ever since .
 Trust me , when she looks back at tonight , she won 't even remember the fire .
 But she may remember this . Oh , my God !
 I 'm so sorry ! Are you all right ? Yes , I 'm perfectly fine .
 At least this blouse made it through dinner .
 Let me get you a towel .
 Hello ! Oh , I hope you don 't mind .
 Dahlia has a birthday coming up , and I saw this hanging there , and I thought , " A robe !
 Well , there 's a notion . "
 So I just tried it on ... to get a sense of the drape .
 Were you also thinking of getting her a lace bra ?
 Oh , dear God !
 Please don 't mention this to any of my family .
 Just take the robe off .
 And whatever you have on underneath ... consider that yours .
 Be reasonable , dear . I 'm only trying to protect you . From Susan ?
 Well , she doesn 't care about my money .
 She 's never asked me for a cent .
 Your logic is as wobbly as the dining room chairs she can 't affordo replace .
 I love Susan , and I won 't ask heto do this .
 Oh , hello .
 Mother 's fine . I- I found her a sweater .
 - So , uh , what won 't you ask me ? - Nothing .
 I was wondering if you 'd object to signing a document that says should you and Ian part ways , you 'll accept a cash settlement and not go after the money he inherits from us .
 You mean a prenup ?
 Please try to understand .
 Our country estate has been in our family for generations .
 We want it preserved for the children we hope Ian will have , not lost in some pricey divorce .
 Well , who 's getting divorced ?
 I 'm in this for keeps .
 I 'm sure you said the same to your first husband before you bolted with all you could carry .
 - Okay , hey -- - Mother , Susan is not signing anything .
 Fine .
 Then we 'll leave it all to your brother .
 Oh , do you think Nigel 's going to give you a grandson ?
 He 's an alcoholic homosexual .
 With a castle at stake , he can learn a new skill . Okay , stop this .
 We invited you here to celebrate our engagement .
 Now I 'm divorced , and Ian 's disinherited ? Hello .
 - Have I missed anything ?
 - We 'll be going soon .
 Please , don 't be offended .
 All of us go into marriage convinced that everything will be perfect .
 God knows I did .
 And then one day , I found a bill for some expensive lingerie -- bustiers , peignoirs -- none of it in my size .
 Certainly opened my eyes .
 But I- I 'm not like my father .
 Trust him , he 's not .
 I 'm sorry , Ian .
 Hey , guys . Uh , hey , Mrs. Scavo .
 I 'm -- I 'm sorry . We were just taking a quick break .
 We 'll -- we 'll get back to work . No .
 No , don 't be silly .
 Who am I -- Tom ?
 I 'm one of you guys .
 Sit down .
 Hey ... you know what we could use ?
 A good old- fashioned bitch session , get some stuff off our chests . So what 's bugging you guys ?
 Okay , I 'll go first . How do we feel about these uniforms ?
 A little ... " eh " ?
 they 're okay .
 But , hey , why -- why do we have to pool our tips ?
 Why can 't we just keep what we earn ?
 Good point , good point .
 But right now we 're talking about these ugly- ass uniforms .
 You know what bugs me ?
 No health benefits .
 I 'm kind of worried about this mole that I found --
 Focus , people !
 The subject is shirts . It 's killing morale . - Well , I kinda like 'em .
 - Really , kim ? ' Cause ...
 I heard one of your customers say that when Hallowe 'en comes around , we should stick a candle in your mouth .
 See ? Morale .
 You guys need to stand up for yourselves .
 It 's your right -- no , it 's your obligation to go to management and demand new shirts .
 And if management doesn 't like it , you tell him he can go screw ! Okay , okay .
 Break 's over , people .
 I 'm gonna go find Tom and talk . Oh !
 Good .
 I can 't believe you tried to undermine me like this . Well , you gave me no choice .
 It 's just a uniform .
 Why can 't you wear it ?
 - Because I need to win one , Tom .
 - What ?
 You keep ordering me around and disagreeing with me and overruling me , and I 'm sick of it .
 We have to do things my way at least every once in a while .
 This was the deal , Lynette .
 You agreed . I 'm in charge here .
 You 're in charge at home . Except we 're never home .
 We live here .
 Our marriage happens here .

 Okay , you know what ?
 We can 't talk about this now . We open in ten minutes .
 - Maybe later we can -- - later I 'll be asleep , and then I will be back here before you wake up .
 We gotta deal with this now .
 Okay , all right ... we 're gonna deal with this now .
 I 'm gonna get ready for the dinner rush , and you 're gonna wear the damn uniform .

 - No .
 - What ? I 'm going home .
 You 're walking out on me ?

 I told you orange meant something bad was gonna happen .
 Hi .
 Remember me ?
 I had dinner here the other night .
 Anyway , I was driving through your neighborhood after having ,
 like , three iced teas , and I really have to go to the bathroom .
 Do you mind ?
 you and I are gonna be so happy together .
 I feel 10 pounds lighter .
 Thank you .
 Hey , you got a minute ?
 I , uh , I need your help with something .
 - I should probably get these inside .
 - Please , I ... I need to ask you about a movie .

 And so the last part I remember , the girl is putting these raw pancakes in front of him , and then something else funny happened .
 I don 't remember .
 It was just a stupid chick flick . Mike , it wasn 't a movie .
 That was us . - What ?
 - Yeah .
 That was the first night that we spent together . I wanted to surprise you .
 With raw pancakes ?
 Well , they weren 't all raw .
 I was trying to spell " Mike , " and the " M " was goopy , but the " ike " was delicious .
 You loved it . I did , huh ?
 Actually , no , it was gross .
 But you were really sweet .
 You just gave me a lot of kisses and said not to worry ,
 I 'd get a lot of chances to make you pancakes 'cause ...
 ' cause I was planning on spending the rest of ... my mornings with you .

 You remember . Yeah .

 I should go 'cause , um , Ian 's parents are here .
 It 's nice to see you .
 Thank you both for coming .
 You know , I- I know I 've said it ten times , but you look fantastic .
 And my offer still stands .
 You do not have to pay for my dress .
 Come on .
 You only needed it for my luncheon , and it looks like it cost a bundle . Trust me , it was a steal .
 I 'm gonna go powder my nose , and then you can start showing me off .

 Heads- up -- I just saw your ex- wife . Ugh , what is she doing here ?
 Some friend of hers is getting a plaque , too .
 You want to duck out after your speech ?
 Are you kidding ?
 I can 't wait till she gets a good , long look at Gaby .

 Hey .
 Hello . I love your dress .
 Thanks . It 's one- of- a- kind , isn 't it ?
 Yeah , couture .
 Mm . Undari ?
 Wow , good eye .
 Well , I do have an unfair advantage .
 I bought it . - So you 're , uh ...
 - Uh- huh . Well , first , let me just say you have amazing taste .
 If we had met in any other context , we would so get along .
 I left those clothes with Victor so he could store them , not loan them to his sluts .
 Okay , you 're mad , so I 'm just gonna blow right by that slut crack . I want my dress back now .
 Okay , let 's be reasonable .
 You can 't wear two dresses to one lunch .
 It 's not like I have a spare in the car .
 Not my problem .
 Give me back the dress . Go ahead .
 Yell all you want .
 You can 't force me to take off this dress .
 This is pepper spray .
 In three seconds , your eyeballs will be on fire .
 Could you help me with the clasp ?

 Hello , Samantha .
 I heard you were ... Isn 't that Gaby 's dress ?
 Gaby ?
 You in there ? Hey , Victor .
 Uh , you 're probably wondering why I 've been in here so long .
 Funny story -- I ran into your ex- wife . Yeah , she , uh , brought me up to speed .

 Okay , it 's time for bed , Travers . But I wanna show Carlos my new turtle .
 Oh . Right .
 I 'm tired . That 's okay , buddy . I gotta get going anyway .
 Hey , you haven 't even finished your wine .
 Sorry , early day tomorrow . Come on , kiddo .
 I 'll tuck you in .

 Sleep tight , Travers . Oh , no ! I 'm such a klutz .
 I think I broke it . Nah , nah , it 's just a flap .
 I can fix that .
 Uh , Edie ?
 Yeah ?
 I can 't see what I 'm doing here .
 Oh . I 'm sorry .
 Maybe I should watch so that if it breaks again , I can fix it .
 Okay , um , so this hinge needs to go in at this angle ... so that the flap works .
 Mmm . See ?
 God , you 're so mechanical .
 Edie , what are you doing ?
 Learning about flaps .
 Nah , I think you 're coming on to me .
 Maybe .
 Okay , Edie , no .
 Come on . We 're close friends , and I don 't want to ruinhat .
 Oh , we 're not that close .
 Let 's just do it and see where it goes .
 Okay , you know what ? It wouldn 't go anywhere .
 Why not ?
 Mm , 'cause ...
 I 'm looking for a girl who wants to settle down and be in a serious relationship , and you 're not that type .
 Oh ?
 What type am I ?
 You 're ... the fun type , who likes to dress sexy and go out and meet new people , and then go out the next night and meet another ... new people .
 You think I 'm promiscuous ?
 I 'm just saying , for a house on a cul- de- sac , this place sees a lot of traffic .
 Just because I 'm popular doesn 't mean that I 'm incapable of a lasting commitment .
 Look , you can 't even commit to your kid .
 He 's here for a month , and you keep dumping him on neighbors so you can go shopping .
 That is , when you 're not using him for sex bait .

 Get out of my house .
 Tom , it 's me again . You should 've been home 30 minutes ago . I know .
 You 're still mad .
 I am , to so why don 't you come home and we can be mad together ?
 See you soon . so what kind of orange is this shirt ?
 Like a salmon or a coral ?
 Oh , cheese doodle .
 Exactly , and I 'm supposed to wear that every damn day .
 Oh , please . It 's not that bad .
 I once worked at this fish- and- ch place .
 I had to wear an eye patch and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder .
 " Would you like to hear arrr specials ? "
 Why don 't you just tell Tom to pick another color ?
 This isn 't about the shirt anymore .
 This is about us working together .
 Every day it 's a battle .
 It 's hurting our marriage .
 You know what ?
 I 'll just tell Tom I need to step back .
 You mean quit ? Yeah .
 We could hire a manager or something .
 Wow .
 How do you think Tom 's gonna feel about that ?
 Well , once he decides to stop hiding , I can ask him . You know what ?
 I 'm tired of waiting . I 'm gonna go down there and I 'm gonna talk to him .
 See you guys later .

 So I guess this means we 're babysitting the kids , huh ? Guess so .
 I 'm an idiot . Would you guys mind ...
 We got it .
 Just go .
 Tom !
 Come on ! I know you 're still here .
 You realize what time it is ?
 I know ! You 're mad .
 But you just ... you can 't avoid me all night .
 Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , Tom .
 Tommy ...
 Okay , okay , you 're breathing .
 That 's good .

 Hello ?
 Hi .
 There 's something wrong , yeah , with my husband . I don 't -- I don 't know .
 He 's unconscious . 357 Hawthorne Place .
 Okay , could you please hurry ?
 Thank you .
 Yes .
 Listen to me .
 I forbid you to die .
 If you leave me with a mortgage and a restaurant and five kids ,
 I swear I will track you into the deepest pit of hell and make you pay . Do you hear me ?
 Come on , baby ...
 Oh , please .
 So that 's it ?
 He threw out his back ? Oh , thank God .
 I 'm guessing he passed out from the pain . Mm .
 But I wanna be clear . A ruptured disc is very serious .
 He 'll need surgery .
 It 'll be a while before he 's back on his feet .
 How much of a while ? We , three months .
 Three months ?
 Even then , he 'll need to go easy .
 What sort of work does he do ?
 We run a restaurant . Mm .
 He shouldn 't go back for four or five months .
 Restaurant work is very stressful .
 Yeah , it is .

 - What 's that ?
 - Oh , it 's the prenup my parents want you to sign . And you brought it to bed ?
 Okay , romance tip number one --
 Sorry . I just can 't get that off my mind .
 I keep thinking , why all this ungodly fuss ?
 Susan 's not in this for money and heirlooms .
 Thank you . I don 't want your family 's stuff .
 What am I gonna do with half a castle ?
 Exactly .
 - So why not just sign it ?
 - Huh ?
 Well , I mean , looking at it rationally , what 's the difference between making the promise you just made to me and making the same promise on paper ?
 Um ... well , the difference is huge .
 I mean , one way you 're trusting me , and ... and the other way , you 're trying to make it official .
 But isn 't that what marriage is -- making your love official ?
 Ian , do you really want to start our life together making me feel like ...
 I 'm on probation ?
 You know that I trust you .
 This isn 't about my fears .
 It 's about my parents . Really ?
 I think it 's about someone else .
 He just wanted me to help him remember something .
 Who ? Mike .
 I saw you watching us .
 We were just talking .
 I never thought anything else .

 Okay , I 'll sign it .
 W- well ... at least read it first .
 I don 't need to . I trust you .

 Oh .
 Hi , Mike .
 So tell me .
 I 've been dying to know .
 Did you talk to Susan ? Could she remember what the movie was ?

 Actually ... no .
 Ah , well , hang in there . We 'll figure it out .
 It 's just a matter of time before everything starts coming back .
 Here , have a seat .
 Uh , listen , you 've been really helpful the last few months , but I think I 'm done here .
 Mike , I- I know this can be a frustrating process .
 But if you give up now , there are so many memories that could be lost to you . Yeah , I 'm okay with that .

 Oh , my God .
 How many did you take ?
 Sorry . I wanted options .
 Stop judging me . I was hopped up on couture .
 Hey , you know , it 's not funny . Samantha called her lawyer .
 What ? Yeah . Over a dress ?
 God , what a bitch . Hey !
 Don 't call her that .
 She threatened me with mace and then slugged you .
 Now you 're on her side ? Gaby , I didn 't marry an angry woman .
 I just divorced one .
 What happened ? Did you have some little mistress on the side ?
 Worse . I treated her like she was the mistress .
 I set her up in a nice house , I gave her an allowance ... and then I- I came and went as I pleased .
 She was always there when I needed her , but if she needed me , well ... and if she wasn 't happy , she could always go out and buy a nice new dress .
 You saw the closet , so you know just how happy she was .
 What ?
 I 've known you for two weeks , and this is the first glimpse of a guy I could actually like .
 A clueless , emotionally stunted workaholic ?
 A guy who can admit he screwed up , one who 's not trying to impress me every second of the day with how perfect and charming he is .
 I wouldn 't mind seeing more of that guy .
 Well , his schedule 's wide open .
 How about dinner tomorrow night ?
 I 'd love to .
 Although , what am I gonna wear now ?
 Doesn 't matter .
 ' Cause I 'm just gonna talk you out of it .
 Look who 's back -- Mr. Cocky .
 He never leaves for long , does he , that guy ?

 Are there any points you 'd like to discuss before you sign ? I 'd like you to say , " We don 't need this .
 We trust you . " But you don 't , so , uh , I 'll sign it .
 And once I do , I am going to earn your trust by being a good wife to Ian .
 Well , we 're sure you will be .
 Um , sign all three copies , please .
 I mean it .
 I am going to be loving and faithful and above all , honest . There 'll be no secrets with Ian .

 I 'll tell him everything .
 Well , we applaud your candor .
 What I 'm trying to say is , there 'll be no topic that I need to ... skirt ,
 No issue that I won 't ... address .
 I won 't conceal my true thoughts under garments of secrecy .
 Good for you .
 Now if you 'll just sign --
 Oh , for God 's sakes , Dahlia .
 Anyone can see she 's not a fortune hunter .
 Graham , what are you doing ? She is willing to sign .
 Which proves she can be trusted .
 I 'm sure you 'll be a good wife to Ian .
 You can count on it .

 I 'm sorry , Carlos .

 Thanks for the flowers .
 You 're welcome . come on .
 You know , about Travers -- you can see him if you want .
 - He misses you . - I miss him , too .
 Oh , and just so you know , he 's at a sleepover , so I didn 't leave him alone with a six- pack and some matches .
 Look , Edie , um ...
 - What I said about you the other day was - - Dead- on .
 You nailed me , Carlos .
 Maybe not the way that I wanted you to , but still ... but I had no right to judge you .
 Besides , the guys , the clothes , the partying -- that 's you .
 I mean , that 's the Edie that we love .
 Well , I 'm glad you love her , because I 'm getting pretty tired of her . - Come on .
 - I 'm a 40- year- old party girl .
 Do you think that I don 't know that my days are numbered ?
 Yeah ... I don 't know what you want me to say here .
 Don 't say anything .
 Just ... stop seeing the person that I 've been and start seeing the person I could be .
 Look at me , not the Edie that I show the world .
 In fact ... let 's lose her .
 Forget the blouse that she wears because she knows it shows off her cleavage . Uh , Edie , what are you doing ?
 And the skirt ... that 's so short , because she knows that guys love long legs .
 And the heels ... the ones that make her legs look even longer .
 Edie , please .
 Forget the bra that holds her breasts a little higher than they are on their own these days .

 And the panties ... the ones that hide the scar from my c- section .

 This is it .
 Hi , Carlos .
 I 'm Edie .
 I might not be the woman that you thought I was under all of that ... but I 'm real , and I 'm here .
 And I 'm asking for a chance .
 Oh .
 Hey , Andrew .
 Aw , thanks . He 's gonna be okay .
