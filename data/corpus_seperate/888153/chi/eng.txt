 yes , i 'm unbelievable . close your mouths . ( lette ) he 's a bachelor who lives with his invalid sister . ( lynette ) our neighbor is a pedophile . you can 't sit on this , lynette .




 he cheated on alma , broke her heart for his precious monique . monique polier ?

 ( man ) the man 's a plumber . i 'll take those .




 hey , did you hear about the new guy that just moved in ? unh- unh . well , get a load of this ... apparently , the perv 's got all this weird stuff in his basement . no , seriously . it 's like this big kiddie trap full of toys .






 ( deep voice ) ho , ho , ho !
 look who 's here !
 merry christmas , everybody ! merry christmas !
 now , kids , who 's been good this year ?

 what am i gonna do with this fire truck ? joey , get back here .
 what 's going on ?
 ( normal voice ) i 'm not sure .
 ( woman ) let 's go , girls .
 art , maybe we should go .






 oh ! you have to kiss me . it 's the law .
 ( chuckles ) mmm .
 while you 're in a good mood , i thought i 'd spring something on you . my parents are coming to town . your parents ? really ? and i wondered if you might be free to join us for dinner saturday .

 absolutely . uh , so i assume this means they know about me ? but of course . and they know about me as in ... ( british accent ) " mum , dad , bloody good ns . i 've got melf a smashing new girlfriend . "

 ( laughs ) that 's adorable . please don 't do it in front of them .
 ( normal voice ) right . so , um , do you want me but it 's a -- it 's a 4- hour layover and they 're going to be exhausted , and i thought we might have a more enjoyable time if they came here and -- and you made dinner for them .

 okay , i guess it 's time we have the conversation .
 ian ... haven 't you ever wondered why i 've never cooked for you ? ????? no , i wish . my cooking ... is not good . well , my parents won 't be expecting a gourmet meal . will they be expecting stomach cramps , acid reflux , night sweats ?





 ( laughs ) come on , you can 't be that bad .
 that i make them a home- cooked meal ? well , it 's just that they 're very old- fashioned hearth- and- home types , and they might wonder why -- why you didn 't make the effort .
 oh , but it 's okay . you -- you -- you 'll win them over ... eventually .
 okay , i 'll give it a shot .
 ( laughs ) thank you .
 now nothing elaborate . just a simple roast and , uh , and something appropriate to go with it . right ...
 like an ambulance . **

 little miss snowflake glides . she doesn 't stomp . is that better ? getting there , sweetie .
 ( under breath ) if she was a horse , we 'd have to shoot her .
 ( under breath ) poor thing , she tries so hard .
 ( normal voice ) yeah , she 's a trooper . let 's dump her .
 ( normal voice ) what ? ! why ? pageant consultants are judged on the strength of their roster . you know , we can 't afford to bounce every nose- picking no- talent , but we can definitely lose the one who 's dragging us down , and that 's amy .
 ( under breath ) we can 't do that ! her mother died last year . yes , i know , i know , and it 's tragic , but we are running a business . amy is sucking up all of our time , and we should be focusing on sherri . she actually has a shot at winning .

 how will i tell her family ? we 'll do it together . we 'll be very diplomatic . are you sure about this ? the poor kid 's been through the wringer and -- amy ! for god sakes ,

 little miss snowflake does not scratch down there !
 ( sighs ) well , then again , her mother died a year ago . how long is she gonna milk it ?
 ahh ... mother hodge , i have your breakfast . just put it over there . i 'll pick through it later .

 what are you watching ? home movies . aw . it 's fun looking back at the past , isn 't it ? well , it 's one way to kill time while you 're waiting for death .

 we also have cable .
 have you decided what you 're gonna do about orson ? decided ? yes . have you called a lawyer yet ? i don 't think that 's any of your concern . i don 't mean to pry , but i think you 're a good christian woman , and you deserve better than my son . well , i will take that under advisement . if you give him a chance , he 'll draw you back in . it 's whahe does . just walk away . it 's not that easy . i love him .








 you 'll get over it . i did .



 well , believe merita , he scares me , too .
 you know what ? we should have a meeting , get all the moms together and figure out what to do about this guy .
 yeah , saturday , your house . sounds good . ( pounding on car ) ( pounding )
 hey , rita , i gotta go .
 sorry , i can 't talk now . i have somewhere to go . well , my brother doesn 't . the youth center just fired him . are you happy ?

 i 'm not sad . he shouldn 't be around kids . i saw those pictures . those boys were on his swim team . he was proud of them . turning that into something dirty says more about you than him . you can defend him all you want . i know what i know . ar engine starts ) did you know my brother got spit on athe hardware store yesterday , that they refused to serve us at the diner , that our tire got slashed at the church parking lot ?




 ( exhales deeply ) i am not a well woman . i don 't need this stress .
 well ... i am sorry that happened . have you considered even for a moment that you could be wrong , that you misinterpreted what you saw , over nothing ?

 i have kids , okay ? better safe than sorry .

 so i 'm cooking dinner for ian 's parents tomorrow night , and it 's the first time i 'm meeting them , so i sort of wanna impress them . and yet you 're cooking ? ! well , that 's the thing . uh , so i was hoping -- you know , if you 're not too busy ... oh , no , no , these things practically build themselves . thank you . you are a lifesaver . actually ... i could probably use the distraction .






 oh ?
 ( sighs ) i asked orson to move out last night .
 oh , come on ! why would you bury your toolbox in the woods ? i knew the cops were looking for it , and i panicked . i was just trying to buy myself me time . well , you may have bought yourself 20 to life ! oh , let the guy enjoy his breakfast . stay out of this , carlos . mike , i want you to look at me . yeah , you look me in the eye and you swear to me that you didn 't kill anybody . how many times do i have to tell you ? i can 't remember . um , guys .








 bree , you have got to go to the police with all of this . i can 't . not yet . i- i need some time to think . his wife goes missing , then his mistress turns up dead . what is there to think about ?

 ( bree sighs ) i know it sounds suspicious , but in my heart of hearts , i just can 't believe that orson could do such a thing . sweetie , we all wanna believe the best of the people we care about , but you cannot let your feelings for a man blind you to cold hard facts .

 what in the world ?
 oh , my god !
 what 's going on ? they just arrested mike for murder . what ? ! they 're saying he killed that woman othe news , that monique person .

 oh , thank god !
 i can 't believe we 're gonna break that little girl 's heart . do not wimp out on me here . we gotta do what 's best for the business . what if the father yells at me ? then i will jump in and defend you . okay , but if you do , try and be diplomatic . i 'm always diplomatic . now just get in there , you spineless 'mo .





 excuse me , mr . pearce ?
 i 'm so glad you could come today . this is my partner gabrielle .
 pleasure to meet you .
 ( laughs )
 ( vern ) shall we ?
 so , uh , what did you wanna talk to me about ? is there a problem with amy ? not a problem , per se . we 're just a little concerned that she might not have the , um ... temperament for pageant competitions . and what does that mean ? well , when it comes to performing , she 's not exactly ...




 well , she tends to be -- feel free to jump in . i have no idea where you 're going with this .
 well , as gaby and i discussed , amy has certain limitations and her odds of winning are slim . vern !
 ( scoffs ) he is so competitive . i constantly have to remind him they 're just kids .
 ( chuckles ) when did you lose the joy ? oh , i think you know . wait , i 'm -- i 'm confused . are you -- are you dumping amy ? of course not , bill . can i call you bill ?



 ( chuckles ) it 's just , we feel that amy would benefit from some private coaching . maybe i could come to your house ? say , friday , 5 : 00 ?
 sure .
 ( laughs ) yeah , i guess . great ! it 's a date .
 ( laughs ) maybe i should come , too . after the harsh things you said about amy ? i don 't think so .
 ( laughs )
 i 'm gonna need a good lawyer and that may take a lile research . uh- huh . and whoever takes my case will need a retainer , so if you don 't mind , i promise i 'll pay you back . oh , okay . and makeure he knows about my wrench . apparently , they tested it ??????


 what 's wrong ?
 i don 't know if you picked up on this , mike , but ... i haven 't been happy .
 no , i didn 't pick up on it . well , i wanted to tell you this weeks ago and i wish that i had , because now i know you 're gonna think that i 'm breaking up with you over this whole blood on the ax thing . wrench . whatever . but believe me , that 's not it .



 it 's jus .. we are moving too fast .
 what are you trying to say ? well , may -- maybe we should just ... take a break . you know ... date other people .
 you 're telling me this on the day i 'm put in a men 's prison ?
 well , i said the timing was bad .
 i am sorry . i ... i really am .
 ( whispers ) i just can 't do this .
 they told me somebody was coming , but i did not expect it to be you . is edie getting you a good lawyer ?
 ( chuckles ) i doubt it . she dumped me today . what ? why ? still ... it 's tacky .


 ( chuckles ) well , okay then , uh ... i- i 'll help get you out . uh ... what 's your bail ?

 a million dollars . oh .
 ( laughs ) you don 't have to help me , susan .
 i want to .
 aren 't you gonna ask ?
 what ? if i killed that woman ?
 i don 't have to . i know you didn 't .
 i wish i was that sure .
 i ... i have these flashes where i see her face , so i must 've known her . and if i did , maybe something happened . maybe i got angry , maybe -- there 's an explanation f this , and we 're gonna figure it out .

 n 't worry about a thing .
 miss gabrielle ! when are you gonna come outside and watch me ? oh , um , the grass , honey , and my allergies ... go ahead and practice . i 'll watch you from here .

 are you sure i can 't help with anything ? ah , i 've been a single dad for a while now . i got the nner thing down . mmm , i 've got the restaurant thing down . i can 't bring myself to cook for one . not that i ever cooked for two .


 ( chuckles ) well , no restaurant tonight . you are having dinner with us . oh , that 's sweet . it 's the least i can do to thank you for helping amy . oh . it 's nothing .



 yeah , she 's a special girl .
 so ... how is it for you , being single again ? oh , honestly ? um ... mm- hmm . i hate it . it 's like i 've forgotten how to date . me , too . you know , i even let a friend of mine talk me into one of those speed dating things . how was it ? mmm , i didn 't even go in . i just sat in this hotel lobby . i watched all these







 lonely , desperate single people filing in , and then it hit me -- i 'm one of them .

 i know what you mean .
 did you see that ? it spun three times and then i caught it . um ... you didn 't see . yeah , i- i 'm sorry , sweetie . i- i was distracting gabrielle . oh , no , no , it 's totally my fault . i 'm sorry , sweetie . go outside and do it again . i promise this time we 're gonna watch .





 ( knock on door )
 come in .
 ( door closes ) hey . wow , oh , those are gorgeous . well , i , uh , i figured you 'd be too busy cooking to manage a centerpiece .
 well , you , uh , you may not be a good cook but you 're -- you 're certainly a tidy one . don 't worry . dinner 's all taken care of . we 're having ... well , that 's very ambitious of you , and , uh , when will bree be done making it ?

 5 : 30 .
 ( chuckles ) but i am rewarming it all by myself .
 oh , what 's , uh , what 's all this ? um , mike was arrest for murder . my god . i- i mean , of course he 's totally innocent . i 'm just trying to help him find a lawyer . oh . shouldn 't , um , shouldn 't his girlfriend be doing that ? yeah . edie dumped him . hmm .





 okay , i know how this looks , but i just feel bad . he 's just a friend now .
 ( sighs ) yes . yes , a friend you sat by for six months , hoping he 'd wake up and ravish you again . so stop worrying .
 ( lowered voice ) orson , it 's me again . please call . we need to talk .
 ( sighs ) i 'll do the chips . you deal . you got it .
 guys , why has it been so long since we 've played poker ? i really need this . oh , me , too . there 's nothing more relaxing than an afternoon of finger food and girl talk . hi , ladies !
 ( lynette ) hey ! how you doing ?
 ( sighs ) so did you tell the police that you think orson killed monique ? what ? ! no , i did not , and i don 't plan to . but mike is in jail , and you said yourself you thought orson did it . i said i had concerns , concerns that have disappeared now that mike has been arrested . what are you saying ? you think mike is guilty ? hey , why don 't we start that girl talk ? i 'll get the ball rolling . anybody have a yeastnfection ?






 they found monique 's blood on the wrench that mike was trying to dispose of . you don 't think that 's worth telling the cops orson was slipping it to the dead chick ? mike is innocent . i know that in my heart . we all have convictions , susan . i believe mike 's last one was for manslaughter . okay , okay , we 've all made some excellent points and blown off a little steam . whoo !





 let 's play some cards .
 if you 're so sure that orson is innocent , why don 't we go through his things ? where 's his desk ? at his office . and what did you think you 'd find there anyway ? i don 't know . a blackmail letter , a necklace made of teeth ? we 're not gonna play cards , are we ? nope . well , i am certainly not playing with a woman that is willing to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband . well , needless to say , i won 't be cooking dinner for ian 's parents . fine . i 'll cook myself . good . let me know if there are any survivors . and if you take orson back , you do the same .









 ( exhales deeply )
 ( bree ) well , that was incredibly awkward . i 'm sorry you both had to sit through it .
 was it me ? was i out of line ?

 hey , come on in . you 're just in time . thanks so much , rita . i think it 's such a good idea that we all get together and talk and ... oh , we decided to stage a protest in front of art 's house . a protest ? mm- hmm . rita , i want the word " pedophile " to really stand out . do we have any glitter ? say " molester . " it sounds scarier . i 'm sorry . i- i- i thought we were all gonna talk about how to keep an eye on this guy . we 're past talking . the guy 's a menace . well , that 's what we think , but we don 't exactly have proof . the youth center just fired him . how much proof to you need ? but , see , the only reason they fired him is because people were gossiping , and the only reason they 're gossipg is because of what i told mrs . mccluskey . yeah , and you told me to spread the word . so -- so that people could watch their kids and be vigilant . so you wanna wait until he actually molests one of our kids ? whose side are you on , lynette ? knock it off , gert . remember , if it weren 't for lynette , we never would 've found out about this cre . she 's our hero .























 ( door opens ) ( door closes )
 ( susan sighs )

 ( amy ) bye- bye , daddy .
 ( bill ) see you , sweetie . have fun . mwah . so i was , uh , i was thinking you -- you wanna grab a cup of coffee or something after class ? i 'd love to grab a cup of coffee ... or something .

 ( laughs )

 ( sighs ) amy , you are so lucky to have such a nice dad . yeah , i know .

 leave him alone . excuse me ? you heard me . i don 't want you dating him .

 oh , sweetheart .
 i have a feeling i know what this is about . no u don" t i think you do miss your mommy , and it feels funny seeing your daddy be nice to somebody else . but believe me , i 'm not trying to replace your mom .
 well , i am , and i have someone all picked out .
 what ? i want my dad to marry sherri 's mom .
 sherri from class ? we 're best friends , and we have it all planned out . our parents are gonna get married , and then we 'll be real sisters . what about your dad ? ??? my mom died . all my dad wants is for me to be happy .



 now get in there and teach me how to work the runway . that 's what we 're paying you for , right ?

 ( turns off television ) ( orson sighs )
 ( bree ) orson ?

 ( orson ) bree ? orson . why haven 't you returned any of my calls ? i was afraid you were calling to ask me for a divorce .
 ( sighs ) no , i wasn 't .
 they arrested mike for the murder of monique polier . they did ? the other night , you wanted a chance to explain everything . well , here it is , and i want it all . if i find out you 've left anything out , then i will ask for that divorce .


 okay .

 ( sighs )
 you must really wanna win this pageant . more than anything . aw . well , i think dedication should be rewarded , so i have a little surprise for you . what is it ? well , you know how the pageant starts with a big opening number ? this year , all the contestants are gonna dance in pairs , and i 've arranged for yoto dance with your best friend amy !





 what 's wrong , sweetie ? well ... amy sucks .

 well , i thought you two were practically sisters ? we are ... but she still sucks . and first impressions are everything . you said so yourself . well , that 's true -- and this is the opening number . if the judges see me tripping all over that klutz , there 's no way i 'm gonna win . that 's a good point . now i wish i hadn 't told amy . you already told her ? ! she was so excited .







 ( sighs ) well , she 's your best friend . why don 't you just tell her the truth ? she 'll understand . what if she doesn 't ? well , friends come and go ... but a crown is forever .



 i never loved alma . my mother pushed us together , and ... i was stupid enough to get her pregnant . you had a child ? alma miscarried a month after the wedding .

 i was trapped . well , you could 've left her . mother wouldn 't hear of it . divorce is a sin .

 so i stayedin the marriage , hoping i would come to feel what i was supposed to , but i never did . so i resigned myself to a life without love .
 and then i met monique .

 it was wrong . i didn 't care .
 i loved her more than i 'd loved anyone ... till you . so why couldn 't you tell me this ? because you told me about rex , how he cheated on you , how hurt you were . bree , i needed you to feel safe with me .


 ( bree ) well , you haven 't done a very good job . handling the truth would have been a hundred times easier than dealing with all the doubt and suspicion .
 ( orson speaking indistinctly )
 so you stayed in a loveless marriage because of your mother ? i know how it sounds .
 but after my father died , she s all i had . his death caused me so much pain .
 ( orson speaking indistinctly ) i would 've done anything for her .
 ( bree speaks indistinctly ) ( orson speaks indistinctly ) she saw that weakness , and she ran with it .
 ( orson speaking indistinctly ) you -- you 've got no idea how manipulative she can be .
 she ruins lives .

 now i 've told you everything .
 what happens now ?
 well ... first you pack up your things and come home , and then ... we toss your mother out on her evil ass . god , i love you .


 hi ! i 'm sorry i 'm late . where are your folks ? they 're not coming . their plane was snowed in at o 'hare . oh . well , that 's too bad . well , no harm done then , huh ? you 're 40 minutes late . but they 're not here . you didn 't know that . and where 's dinner ? uh ... bree and i sort of had a fight . um ... look , i 'm awfuy sorry that i 'm late . i- i had an emergency . did this emergency have anything to do with mike ?










 i 'm pretty sure that bree 's husband murdered the woman the cops think mike killed . i went to his office -- oh , for god sakes , susan . no , no , i found evidence . look . orson was committed to a mental institution for over a year . i mean , doesn 't that suggest he 's some sort of -- i don 't care !


 tonight meant a great deal to me , and you blew it off .
 i said i was sorryian .

 i have to help mike . i 'm all he 's got .
 actually , you 're wrong . he 's got me . what ? tomorrow , i 'll hire the best lawyer in town to defend him , and i 'll pay every cent of his bill .
 you would do that for mike ? yes , on one condition ...

 you can 't see him anymore .
 why ? if you start visiting him , being a friend to him , he 'll fall in love with you again . then you 'll have to decide whose heart to break , his or mine .
 as jealous ultimatums go , that 's very flattering , but i don 't think that 's necessary . mike and i are done . then you should have no problem accepting my generous offer .
 you would really get him the best lawyer in town ? an absolute piranha .
 do we have a deal ?

 well , okay then .

 you know , mike barely remembers me . what makes you so sure he would fall in love with me again ?
 what a perfectly asinine question . how could he not ?

 ( all shouting at once ) ( shouting continues ) god , i was only in the house 15 minutes . are there more of them now ? yep .
 ( shouting continues ) go ahead , say it . i know you want to . this is all your fault . you should 've listened to me . i know , but be fair . there is no way i could 've anticipated this . you tell people frankenstein 's on the loose ,


 i 'm putting the kids to bed early . i don 't want 'em to see this .
 ( siren wailing ) is that an ambulance ?

 ( amy ) i can 't believe you 're doing this ! ??? god , i hate you ! i hate you !
 don 't ever talk to me again !

 hi . bill ? i was wondering , do you have plans saturday night ?
 ( crowd speaking indistinctly ) excuse me . i 'm sorry . what -- excuse me , can you -- can you tell me what happened ? ma 'am , i need you to step back . okay . we 're brinng in a female , late 30s . and get crash ca ready . she 's in cardiac arrest .



 there he is . there he is .
 ( crowd speaking indistinctly ) ( all shouting at once ) stop it ! stop it ! you can 't do this to people ! have you lost your minds ? ! well , excuse us for wanting to feel safe in our own homes . well , that 's my home , and i don 't feel very safe right now . please , please , all of you , just leave this street . please , i beg of you . go ! just get off my street , please ! wait , wait ! art , wait , i 'm sor -- ( shouting continues ) i 'm sorry .









 you 're an idiot to take him back . i am no longer interested in your opinion . i thought i made that clear . where are you sending me ? oh , we 've rented you a condo in a lovely retirement community . it 's our christmas gift to you . so you 're exiling me ? cutting me off from my new grandcldren ? that 's our gift to them .






 it 's over , mother . i told her everything . oh , i doubt that very much . you still have secrets , my boy . so do you , mother , and if you want them kept , you 'll keep mine .



 it 's me . i have some bad news . she 's taking him back . meet me on the corner in an hour . we need to deal with this .

 i heard about rebecca on the news .
 if there 's anything i can do to help , i ... uh , with the funeral arrangements or , uh ... help you call relatives ... wow .
 you must be feeling really guilty . oh ! of course ! i- i- i feel just terrible . i- i mean , if you knew , if you could just know i 'm -- how sorry i am .

 hey .
 you know , in a weird way ... i should thank you .
 my sister was ... a really wonderful person .
 she always saw the best in me .
 but there were things she couldn 't see ... or chose not to , god love her .

 what do you mean ? i think you know .
 see , i always knew that i had to take care of rebecca , so i could never let myself ... slip and do something that would hurt her .
 but now ...
 ( exhales deeply ) i 'm free ...
 ( whispers ) and all because of you .

 you -- you can 't stay here . oh , don 't worry . i 'm already packed .
 where are you going ? why , you gonna write ?

 well ... ( sniffles ) good- bye , lynette .
