 You look cute in bubbles . You 're just all liquored up .

 Hey , it 's me .
 I 'm coming in .
 I 've had a very long , hard day .
 [ UNCUT ] - You 're home early .
 - Yeah , my date threw up .
 Want some chicken ?
 No , thanks . No chicken .
 Bye- bye .
 You sure ?
 Some extra- crispy , dirty rice ? For the last time , no ! Get out , Joey !
 All right .
 Are you okay ? He wouldn 't leave .
 He kept asking me if I wanted chicken .
 Chicken ? I could eat some chicken .

 Could I get a three- piece , some coleslaw , some beans and a Coke ? Diet Coke . The One With All the Kissing






 - Morning , Pheebs .
 - I have to tell you this story .
 I was coming over and this cabdriver ... Was his name Angus ?
 What ?
 He was a cabdriver we had in London .

 All right . Anyway ...
 What was that pub he took us to ? The Wheat Sheaf !
 And they had that beer ... Boddington 's !
 Pheebs was going to tell a story .
 So he had a really funny hat .
 I don 't want to talk about it .
 - Hey . - Hey , Ross !
 Boddington 's ! Oh , man !
 I 'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys .
 They have them at the British pub by the Trade Center .
 Later ! Shouldn 't Rachel be back ?
 Her plane got delayed . But she should be here by now .
 So you talked to her ?
 Did she sound mad ?
 No . But she likes me .
 You abandoned her on a plane to Greece .
 I did not " abandon " Rachel .
 Okay ? Emily showed up at the airport . I had to go after her .
 I did what I had to do .
 She 's my wife .
 Rachel is my wife .
 Emily ! Emily is my wife .
 Man , what is that ?
 You haven 't heard from Emily ?
 Not since I lost her at the airport .
 I can 't believe she can outrun you .
 Hey ! She 's fast , okay ?
 You think you can beat me ? Let 's go ! Outside !
 [ UNCUT ] - I 'm sorry . I 'm just a little ...
 - Slow ?
 [ UNCUT ]
 Oh , you want some ? !
 [ UNCUT ]
 Okay , get the shoes on ! Let 's go , man ! [ UNCUT ]
 It 's cool , okay ? [ UNCUT ]
 You 're the fastest ! - Hi !
 - Oh , my God , Rachel ! Rach , I am so sorry .
 I am so , so sorry . Come on .
 You just did what you had to do .
 That 's it ? You 're not mad ? It must 've been terrible .
 Terrible ?
 Hell , I was in Greece !
 There was a nice hotel , nice beach , met the nice people .
 It 's not too shabby for Rachel . So , what , that 's it ?
 We 're cool . Totally cool .
 Thanks , Rach . You 're the best . Oh , no .
 You 're the best .
 Oh , I got to go to the flower store .
 No one will tell me where Emily is ... ... so I 'm sending 72 long- stemmed , red roses to her parents ' house .
 One for each day I 've known and loved her .
 That should get her talking . When you make out the card , be sure to make it out to " Emily . "

 It 's good that you had such a good time in Greece .
 What ? I didn 't have a good time in Greece ! Ross abandoned me !

 I couldn 't get a plane out . I had to stay in their suite !
 People came up to me going , " Mrs. Geller !
 Why are you cry ? "
 I mean , it was so humiliating !
 I felt like such an idiot ! It 's all my fault .
 You know why ? Because I make very bad decisions .
 Oh , that 's not true .
 Yes , it is true . I went after Ross in stupid London !
 London is stupid ! Stupid ! [ UNCUT ]
 I put on a cheerleading outfit to seduce Joshua .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Then I lost him because I asked him to marry me after four dates .
 [ UNCUT ]
 And then I went to Greece on somebody else 's honeymoon . Okay ?
 [ UNCUT ]
 Do those sound like very good decisions to you ?
 [ UNCUT ] I like your little braid .
 [ UNCUT ]
 I just shouldn 't be allowed to make decisions anymore .
 Phoebe , you were right .
 I should 've never gone to London . From now on , you make all my decisions for me .
 Oh , no .
 I did that for someone once .
 I 'm not comfortable having that power over someone 's life . I 'll do it .
 Fine .
 Monica , you are now in charge of my love life . Okay . I got to go to work .



 And Rachel , great to have you back .


 Always a pleasure .

 Rachel ?
 Sweetie , look .
 Here 's a cute picture of you and Joey . He 's married .
 Ross is married . I still can 't believe it .
 Honey , sweetie , by the edges .
 I 'll just have to accept it .
 I mean , it 's my fault . Edges !
 Fingers ! Smudgy ! Oh , my God !

 That 's okay .
 I know that you 're very upset right now .
 I know that wasn 't about me .
 I bet it was about her a little .
 If you 'd stop thinking about Ross ... ... you 'd notice there are great guys everywhere .
 Look . Gunther .
 He 's nice .
 He 's cute .
 Yeah . I guess Gunther is ...
 What about that guy over there ?
 That 's the guy you flirted with at the counter . - Oh , I don 't know .
 I don 't know .
 - You 're going to talk to him .
 I make your decisions , and I say you 're going to talk to him .
 All right . You 're the boss .
 I got to do what you tell me .
 Say that to him , and you 're golden .

 Hey , Pheebs .
 We got our pictures back from London .
 Here 's all of us at the Tower of London ...
 Here we all are .
 There 's Ross and Joey and you and ...
 And me .
 We 've been talking about London too much .
 Sorry , it 's just because I couldn 't be there . All I get to do now is pregnant stuff .
 It bums me out . - I 'm sorry .
 - Sorry .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Know what I like to do ?
 It sounds a little corny ...
 [ UNCUT ] ... but sometimes when I 'm bummed out , I like to just close my eyes ...
 [ UNCUT ] ... and think about what a wonderful gift life is .

 [ UNCUT ] See ?
 - What happened ?
 - A little of this , a little of that . I got myself a date tomorrow . See ?
 Didn 't I tell you ?
 You 're getting over Ross already .
 Get out .





 What took so long ? I got caught up at work .
 But I 'm quitting tomorrow .


 So thanks for having me over .





 See you , man .
 What the hell was that ?
 Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London .
 That 's not European .
 It felt French .

 [ UNCUT ]
 Come here and give me a little sugar .


 I really had a good time .
 Yeah , me too .

 I guess this is it .
 Unless you want to come inside ?
 Wait a minute . You know what ? I can 't decide this .
 Okay . Just hold on a second .


 Where 's Monica ?
 I have to ask her something .
 Doing her laundry .
 What 's that ?
 It came in the mail today . It 's 72 long- stemmed red roses .
 One for each day I 've known and loved Emily ... ... cut up into mulch .

 Honey , that 's awful .
 It 's not so bad .
 Monica 's going to make potpourri .
 I think I 'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while .
 It 's not raining . I can 't catch a break !
 You 're not going anywhere .
 Sit right here . I 'll make you some tea and we 'll talk this out . All right ?
 Hey , Dave .
 I need to take a rain check .
 My roommate is really sick . Okay . Bye !
 Honey , listen .
 I know things seem so bad ... ... and that they won 't get any ...
 Could I talk to you ?
 I dropped some socks .

 What is the matter with you ?
 Do you want to fall into the trap ?
 You did not drop any socks ! I saw Dave , and he said you blew him off !
 You listen to me ! I 'm calling the shots ! I say you leave Ross and go get Dave .
 What are you doing ?
 Well , ultimately I was trying , you know , I wanted ... ... to tell him that I 'm still in love with him .
 What ? You cannot tell him that ! Why ?
 Why not ? People love to hear that !
 [ UNCUT ] Come on , I love you . [ UNCUT ]
 - Wasn 't that nice ?
 - No .
 I make the decisions and I say no ! No , you don 't make my decisions , because ... ... you 're fired .
 You know what ?
 You can 't fire me .
 I make your decisions , and I say I 'm not fired !
 Ha !
 Well ...


 Come on , let me in ! Having some trouble ?
 Rachel locked the door .
 I 'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Ross , there 's something I wanna talk to you about .
 [ UNCUT ]
 - I just need to ... - Rachel , open this door !
 [ UNCUT ]
 - What , is it locked ?
 - She 's fine .
 Listen ... [ UNCUT ] Rachel , I can do this all night if I have to !
 [ UNCUT ]
 - You want me to get that ?
 - No .
 Just let her do her thing ...
 [ UNCUT ] ... and we 'll do our thing .
 Because I really need to tell you ...

 Thank you .
 Rachel ? Can I talk to you outside for a sec ?

 We really need to talk . Well , then talk . Okay , I will .

 Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do ?
 What thing ?

 Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons .
 Which I think is a really stupid idea . It 's dangerous .
 She won 't get what she wants .
 And who knows who she might end up hurting ?

 Monica 's right . Swing dancing can be tricky .
 I have to use the phone . I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily .
 My God ! Think of the massacre . I 'm going to do it .
 I know you think I 'm crazy .
 But before you tell him , try to find one person ... ... who thinks it 's a good idea .
 I bet you can 't . Please ?
 All right .
 Fine .
 Joey ! I 'm in !
 All right . Good deal .

 [ UNCUT ]
 - Hi . - Hey , Rach .
 [ UNCUT ] - Did you find anyone who agrees with you ?
 - No . [ UNCUT ] But you know what ?
 I think I need a male point of view .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Joey . [ UNCUT ] - You 're a man .
 - You got that right . [ UNCUT ]
 Do you think it would be a good idea if I told Ross that I was still in love with him ?
 [ UNCUT ] Nope .
 - Pheebs !
 - Hey , Pheebs .
 - Pheebs ? - Yeah .
 You know how you were saying you didn 't get to go to London ... ... and you were feeling left out ?
 Well , we all felt really bad about that ... ... so we decided to take a little trip together !
 Oh , that 's so nice !
 How great ! Where 's the trip ?
 Well , we thought we would all go to a picnic ... ... in Central Park !
 Central Park ? All of us .
 All day .
 That sucks ! That 's not a trip !
 I just came from there . What 'll we high- five about at the stupid park ?
 It 's right by my house .
 All right !
 I 'm going home to bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea .
 Hold on a sec there , Mr. Kissy .
 I wanted to talk to you about ... ... this whole new European thing you 've got going on .
 And I need to say it makes me very uncomfortable ... ... and I just , you know , just stop it !
 Just bringing some culture to the group .
 That 's fine . Just don 't bring it in my mouth . It makes me want to puke .

 Hey , everybody !
 Pheebs is here ! - Phoebe ! Woo !
 - Okay . Woo !
 Hi ! Pheebs , we decided that the picnic idea was a little ... It didn 't have any ...
 Well , it blew .
 We thought that this afternoon we 'd all go away for the whole weekend ... ... to Atlantic City . Atlantic City ! Oh , that 's a great plan !
 Whose plan was that ?
 Mine !
 - Wait .
 It was my plan .
 - No ... ... I said we needed a new plan .
 And I came up with Atlantic City .
 Which is the new plan .
 Why don 't we all meet upstairs in an hour .
 I 'm going to go pack .
 I 'm going to go pack my ass off . [ UNCUT ]
 Well , I think I 'm gonna grab some coffee because my ass is already packed .

 Let 's go .
 You know what ? I 'll meet you in a minute .
 Rachel , you didn 't find anyone , so you can 't tell him .
 You know what ? That doesn 't matter .
 Do you know how painful it is to tell someone you love them ... ... and not have them say it back ?
 I don 't care .
 I can 't watch .


 What you reading ? Paper . Yeah ?
 What 's it about ?
 Events from around the globe .
 There 's something I have to talk to you about .
 Everyone 's saying I shouldn 't . But I think they 're wrong . People can be wrong .
 Once at work ... ... I thought carbon dating is fossilized ...
 I 'm really trying to tell you something here . Go ahead .
 I think I 'm just going to say it . I 'm just going to say it .

 I 'm still in love with you , Ross .


 I 'm not sure what to do with that right now .

 What ? Was that a joke ?
 Because it 's mean .

 I 'm so dead serious ! I 'm totally serious ! Why are you laughing ?
 Because I just heard it !
 I heard it . And it 's ridiculous !
 I mean ...
 You 're married !
 You 're married , and it 's just ridiculous !
 When I said it , I sort of floated up out of my body .
 And then I heard myself say it , and then the floating Rachel ...
 I was like , " You are such an idiot ! "
 - Well , I am married .
 - I know .
 Though I haven 't spoken to her since the wedding .
 I 'm sorry . That 's not funny .
 Actually , it kind of is .
 My wife won 't return my calls .

 I don 't know where my wife is .

 " Hey , Ross ! Where 's the missus ? "
 " Don 't know ! "
 Oh , God !
 You know what ? Could you forget I told you this ?
 Well , I kind of have to .
 Because the thing is ...
 The thing is , you know , that you 're married to Emily .
 That is what the thing is .
 Oh , God .
 Things won 't be weird between us , right ?
 Was that stupid ?
 Me telling you that ?
 I 'm glad you did .
 If nothing else ... ... it 's always great when someone tells you they love you .
 That 's what I said !
 - Thank you for being so nice .
 - No .
 Thank you for ...
 Thank you .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Oh , God .
 I 'm just glad I didn 't give you the cassette I made of all of our songs .
 [ UNCUT ]
 - What songs ?
 - Oh , you know :
 [ UNCUT ]
 - " With or Without You . "
 - Oh , yeah .
 [ UNCUT ]
 - " Everybody Hurts . "
 - Oh , yeah .
 [ UNCUT ]
 - " Rhiannon . "
 - Why " Rhiannon " ?
 [ UNCUT ]
 Come on , you remember !
 In the living room ?
 [ UNCUT ]
 On Monica 's laundry ?
 [ UNCUT ]
 Not me .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Really .
 [ UNCUT ]
 So , what happened ?
 [ UNCUT ]
 Well , it was really hard ...
 [ UNCUT ] ... but I 'm glad I did it .
 [ UNCUT ]
 So was I right or wrong ?
 [ UNCUT ]
 - Oh , come on , honey , does it really matter ?
 - No .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Yes .
 I need it for my score book .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Diary .
 - Okay , let 's go !
 - Yeah , Atlantic City !
 Come on !
 Atlantic City , baby !
 Let 's roll some bones .
 Hey , Joey !
 High- five for rolling bones .
 Pheebs , you 're leaking .
 Oh , my God !
 Your water broke !
 Oh , okay .
 Well , don 't worry .
 I call shotgun .
 Pheebs , we have to take you to the hospital now .
 [ UNCUT ]
 Okay .
 Well , there 's probably one on the way to Atlantic City .
 Pheebs , the babies are coming now .
 Honey !
 High- five !
 The babies are coming !
 Remember when my water broke ?
 I can 't believe Phoebe 's going to have her babies !
 I know .
 It 's beautiful and amazing .
 I can 't believe I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left the room .
 It 's too bad they didn 't see us having sex .
 Do you know anything about women ?
 - It 's all right .
 - Okay .
