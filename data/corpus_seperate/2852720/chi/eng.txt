 Vegas !
 The ladies are away , the boys will play . Anything can happen .
 It 's gonna get crazy .
 Dungeons & Dragons !

 I got a brand- new bikini , so drinks at the pool are on these .
 I got a sexy new tube top that says " Come hither " and a can of pepper spray that says " Close enough , Jack . "
 I got some old underwear I 'm gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert .
 I 'm sorry , why old ?
 ' Cause last time I saw him , I threw new ones and it got me nothing .
 I 've got a brand- new seven piece set of polyhedral dice .
 ( sniffs ) Hello , new dice smell .
 I 've got my helm of lordly might , my boots of speed , and if things get too exciting , my inhaler of asthma .
 I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him .
 And I had a sensible salad for lunch , so I can eat all the pizza I want .
 Come on , are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls , or are we gonna play D & D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls ? !

 Original Air Date on May 9 , 2013
 I 'm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight . Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros .
 Isn 't every conversation you two have awkward ?
 Eh ? Painfully so . We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes , you can just hang up .
 So into her .
 Ready whenever you guys are .
 Yeah , yeah , we 'll be right there .
 Yeah , Leonard ... Yeah ? I 'm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you .

 Oh , that 's nice .
 But relax , sometimes change is good . Uh , you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock , but you wound up liking him .


 Oh , please .
 Every time the topic of change comes up , you throw Zachary Quinto in my face .
 I 'm upset the mailman has a new haircut :
 Zachary Quinto .
 I 'm upset that daylight saving time started :
 Zachary Quinto .
 I 'm upset daylight saving time ended : Zachary Quinto . I 'm saying this for the last time :
 Zachary Quinto was a weird , wonderful , unrepeatable event .
 So stop using him against me .
 Okay , here we go . You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest .
 Before you is a oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage .
 He says , ( imitating Nicholas Cage ) :
 " Travel with caution .
 " These woods are home to the bones
 " of many a fallen ... ( shouts ) : hero ! "
 See , Howard 's just as good a dungeon master as I am .
 As good ? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard , four- eyes .
 KOOTHRAPPALl :
 Hey , come on , guys , focus .
 Um , uh ...
 Oh , mighty Nicolas Cage tree , we thank you for your warning , but we are brave warriors , and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal .
 ( cell phone chimes )
 Oh , Lucy 's free after all .
 See ya .
 Hey , hey , hey , you can 't leave .
 We just started .
 You 're right , I should finish the game .
 I take my plus- one long sword , stab myself in the face with it .
 I 'm dead , I 've got a date with a girl .
 Bye .
 We 'll be fine , watch .
 ( clears throat ) Suddenly , a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali 's bloody corpse , and says , ( imitating Koothrappali ) :
 " Don 't worry , buddies ,
 " Ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest . " ( imitating Nicholas Cage ) : " Well , I 'm just
 " a tree , but if I were you , I 'd listen to your ( shouts ) : ghost friend ! "
 Go on , give him your lunch money .
 I 'm very happy you were able to hang out tonight .
 Me , too .
 Not that it 's up to you to make me happy .
 Uh , well , unless you find neediness sexy . In which case , you 're about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet .

 Can I tell you something ?
 I was so nervous about seeing you , before I left my apartment , I put roll- on antiperspirant all over my body .
 Really ? Yeah . If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head , you 'll know why .
 I , uh , I 'm sorry to put you through that .
 Oh , it 's okay .
 I 've been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared .
 What else have you been thinking about doing ?
 Well , let 's see . I 'd love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don 't like bangs .
 I like your bangs .
 Oh , thanks , I like 'em , too .

 What else ?
 Mm ... it 's kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door- to- door .
 Mm , yeah .
 Those are both toughies . I know .
 I have a two- year subscription to
 I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way .
 Uh ... it does .
 ( makes creaking door sound )
 He does sound effects , too !
 Hey , I always did sound effects .
 A- A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon .
 ( makes flapping sound ) Uh , uh , they attack a nearby unicorn .
 ( moaning ) ( makes flapping sound )
 Okay , well , I have a sound effect for those sound effects .
 ( blows raspberries )
 Guess who !
 What are you doing back ? That 's an excellent question .
 Amy ?
 Uh , well ... when we were going through security ,
 I got pulled out of line for a pat- down . The , uh ,
 TSA agent got a little handsy ... I may have broken her nose with my elbow .
 Long story short , she 's on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone .
 I 'm sorry .
 I feel like such an idiot .
 Oh , it 's not so bad .
 You lost money , you 're filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger .
 I mean , that 's Vegas , you nailed it . You guys enjoy your evening .
 I 'm gonna go before I ruin anybody else 's weekend .
 That 's my girl .
 LEONARD : No , no . Amy , wait .
 Uh , uh , I know it 's not the night you had in mind , but why don 't you guys stay and play with us ?
 It 'll be fun . It would -- fun ?
 Yeah , okay , three weeks ago , you bought crunchy peanut butter , but now you want the girls to play D & D -- do you have a drug problem ?
 What 's the big deal ?
 Raj bailed , so we could use some extra players . Well , I 've just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before .

 Oh , don 't worry , sweetie .
 No one has . So , what do you say ?
 I 'll leave it up to the dungeon master .
 ( chuckles ) Yeah , a ... satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says , ( imitating Al Pacino ) :


 " You 're playing D & D.
 " You 're playing D & D.
 " This whole ... is playing D & D. "

 Okay , who wants a drink ?
 Yeah , we -- now , Penny , we don 't consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons .
 It impairs our judgment .
 Oh , this isn 't alcohol .
 It 's a magic potion that makes me like you .

 Double potion , please . Okay , here we go .
 You find yourselves face- to- face with two hulking ogres .
 ( deep voice ) :
 " What are you doing " in our dungeon ?
 You shall die ! "
 Okay , literal goose bumps .
 Look .
 What do you do ? I draw my broadsword .
 I ready my quarter- staff . I drink my potion .
 I say we attack the big one .
 PENNY : You know what ? Give me the dice , I want to roll .
 Well , the dungeon master 's supposed to roll .
 Yeah , well I 'm supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet .
 Now give it . All right , what do I need ?

 Uh , 15 or higher . 15 's the point , the point is 15 .
 Give the little lady some room , here it is , coming out .
 Sixteen ! Yes !
 ( cheering )
 Oh , please tell me we 're playing for money .
 Oh , even better than money .
 You gained experience points .
 More potion , please .
 Yeah .

 How are your crab cakes ?
 Kind of funky . That 's great .
 It is ? Does " funky " mean something different in India ?
 No , no .
 Uh , you 've always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant ; here 's your chance .
 Mm . It 's okay . I just won 't eat 'em .
 Don 't be ridiculous . Waiter ?
 Everything all right ?
 Uh ... yeah .
 Everything all right with you ?
 Yes .
 ' Kay , thanks , bye .
 Hold on .
 Isn 't there something else you wanted to tell him ? N- No , it- it 's fine .
 Uh ...
 He 's from a different country ; he doesn 't understand our ways .
 Don 't be silly .
 Just tell him .
 I have to go to the bathroom .
 And it 's not because the crab cakes are funky . So you 're okay here ?
 Uh , yeah , sorry .
 She 's just a little shy .
 The- the first time we met , she was so nervous , she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me .
 Uh- oh .
 Hey , Raj .
 Funny story .
 Come on , mama wants a pair of dead ogres !
 17 ! The larger ogre is dead ! ( cheering )
 The- the other ogre says , " You killed my brother .
 Now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined . "
 That is amazing .
 He made me care about the ogre !
 All right , Amy , there 's one ogre left .
 Take him out !
 Okay .
 Pretend he 's that TSA agent .
 Come on .


 Nineteen ! ( cheering )
 Yes !
 This is turning out to be even better than Vegas !
 ( laughs ) No , it 's not !

 Lucy ?
 Oh , hey .
 Long time no see .
 You don 't know me very well , but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company , it chips away at my masculinity .
 I 'm sorry . Why would you leave like that ?
 You were pushing me ; I clearly didn 't want to send my food back , and you tried to make me do it anyway .
 Okay , if I upset you , then why didn 't you just say something ?
 Well , how can I tell you I 'm upset if I can 't tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead 's my best feature ?
 It 's scary . Yeah , well , I like you a lot , and that 's scary for me .
 Mostly because you 're a proven flight risk .
 How could you like me a lot ?
 Well , uh , for one thing , you have bigger emotional problems than I do , and I find that very attractive in a woman !
 I- I don 't know .
 I just ... ( sighs )
 I think you 're wonderful .

 I 'm sweating out of my head .
 The dragon falls from the sky , crashing into the volcano !
 ( cheering ) But wait ! He 's not dead .
 He crawls out , spreads his wings and prepares to attack .
 Yeah , uh , wait ! Doesn 't he say something first ?
 You know , maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity ?
 Fine . ( imitating Christopher Walken ) : " You 'd think , after all these years ,
 " I 'd know not to fly over volcanoes .
 I 'm a freaking idiot . " The dragon 's Christopher Walken !

 That 's perfect .
 All right , Amy , it 's your turn .
 We need one more hit . Finish him off !
 Here we go . Fifteen ?
 It 's a hit .
 The dragon collapses to the ground ! ( cheering ) Wait .
 Wait .
 And says ... ( imitating Christopher Walken ) : " Mother ?
 " Is that you ?
 Your little boy is coming home . "
 Oh , I don 't know about you guys , but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight .
 This may be the potion talking , but you are one fine- ass dungeon master .
 Oh , yeah ? Well , when we get home , I 'm gonna take you on a whole different adventure .
 SHELDON :
 Another quest by Wolowitz ? Count me in .
 Sheldon , they 're talking about sex .
 Oh , then I 'm out .
 Ooh ! I have an idea .
 Since it 's not happening anytime soon , why don 't your character and your character do it in the game ?
 Ooh !
 Come on , back me up here .
 Oh . Ooh ! Ooh !
 Okay , I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy .
 Oo ...
 Sorry , I thought you were gonna do that ...
 The love spell takes effect .
 When Sheldon looks at Amy , she is the most beautiful half- orc he 's ever seen , and he 's overcome with a desire to rip her armor off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts .
 When Amy sees Sheldon , he looks ... well , just like Sheldon , 'cause apparently she 's into that .
 What do you do ?
 I don 't like this .

 You see what happens when you let girls play D & D ?
 ( knocks ) SHELDON : Amy .
 ( knocks ) Amy . ( knocks )
 Amy . What ?
 I 've never knocked on my own door before .
 That was a wild ride .
 You don 't have to come in here and cheer me up . Thank you .
 Would you go tell everyone else that ?
 Because they sure think otherwise . I 'll tell you what they think .
 They think our relationship is a joke .
 Well , I don 't think our relationship is a joke .
 I think
 " a horse goes into a bar , bartender says , ' Why the long face ? ' " That 's a joke .
 It 's a good one , too , because a horse has a long face .
 Sheldon , are we ever going to have an intimate relationship ?
 Oh , my .
 That 's an uncomfortable topic .
 Amy ... fore I met you ,
 I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone .
 And now ?
 And now what ?
 Do you have any interest now ?
 I have not ruled it out .
 Wow . Talk dirty to me .
 I know it doesn 't seem like it to you , but , for me , what we have is extremely intimate .
 I guess I know that .
 It 's just ... part of me wants more .
 More ?
 I mean , look at us .
 It 's only been three years ; here we are in bed together .


 Come on .
 Let 's go back out there . Y ... Well , no .
 Hold on .
 My Elven magic- user and your half- orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them .
 We wouldn 't really be playing the game right if we didn 't see that through .
 Okay .
 I believe that , uh , we just killed a dragon . While the others pillage the corpse ,
 I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armor .
 It comes off .
 Oh .
 What do you do ?
 I ... ... kiss you ... on the lips .
 I kiss you back on the ... ... lips as well .
 Your turn .
 I ... remove your armor .
 What do you do ?
 I ... erotically caress your ... ... nose .
 Keep rolling .



 Hey , you guys have been in there for a while .
 You doing okay ? SHELDON : We 're fine , thank you .
 Okay , we just want to say , we feel really bad about ...
 AMY :
 Go away !
 Sheldon is nibbling on my ... ( die rolls ) 14 !
 Yes !
