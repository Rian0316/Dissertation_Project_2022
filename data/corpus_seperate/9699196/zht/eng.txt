 [ " Itty Bitty Pretty One " by Screamin ' Jay Hawkins playing ] [ panting ] - I think we should have sex .
 - We are having sex .
 Oh , you mean up the ...
 - Like , sex .
 - Yeah .
 What are you doing ?
 Waiting for you to ... put it in .
 Oh , did you already douche ?
 I mean , unless you 're cool with it maybe being a bit messy .
 Uh , no .
 Of course I already douched .
 ' Cause I like to be clean .
 Speaking of clean , I ...
 I 'm gonna go wash my hands .
 ' Cause that 's how clean I am .
 [ music stops abruptly ]

 [ exhales forcefully ]
 [ phone ringing ]
 - [ exhales ]
 - [ phone ringing ]
 Sorry , I should ... Hello .
 [ deadpan ] Help !
 I 've been mugged .
 Come now . It 's an emergency .
 Hold on . Wait . No , slow down .
 Don 't move , I 'll be right there .
 So , Olivia 's been mugged .
 Sorry . I 've gotta go .
 Rain check ?
 Yeah , of course . I hope she 's okay .
 You know , people think you 're mean , but you 're actually so sweet .
 [ laughs ]
 Okay , thanks . All right , see you , bye .






 [ snorting ]
 [ inhales ] [ exhales ]

 Come on .
 You need to spit .
 Can you get me a mirror , please ?

 Oh , I see .
 - Yeah . - Yeah ?
 - Yeah . - All good ?
 - Thank you . - Perfect .
 Oh , you 're a twat .
 It 's looking good .
 So when can he get back to training ?
 Shouldn 't I wait , Mum ? It 's literally just come off .
 [ doctor ] You 'll be fine .
 Take it slow , obviously , but it 's important to build your strength up .
 You can start training again this week .
 Maybe tomorrow evening ?
 - Thanks for taking her , Cynthia . - That 's all right , love .
 Jonathan 's always wanted a sibling .
 Your mum 's holding down that job then ?
 Wonders never cease .
 Yeah , she 's enjoying it , I think .
 Okay .
 See you later . Be good .
 [ cat purring ]
 - Bye . - Bye .
 Do you want to hang out later ?
 I 've got plans .
 - Ooh , and what are your plans ? - Haven 't decided yet .
 Great . I 'm looking forward to hanging out later then .
 [ Otis ] Oh , I still can 't believe she called me " uptight . "
 - Seriously . - Well , you do over- analyze stuff . - Oh !
 Oh , so you agree with her ? - No ! No !
 Well , you are a bit rigid at times , don 't you think ?
 I 'm not rigid . I am ...
 I 'm totally chill .
 - Okay . - In fact , I 'm going to show you both just how chill I am .

 I 'm going to have a small gathering of friends at my house tonight .
 - A party ? - No , a small gathering .
 And I 'm gonna cook a roast chicken .
 Don 't cook a roast chicken . Cooking a roast chicken is not chill .
 Okay ? Who are you going to invite ? You don 't have any friends .
 - Yes , I do . - Who ?
 I have you and ...
 - Lily . - Lily ? Is Lily your friend ?
 Yes , she is . I helped her vagina open up .
 - But don 't repeat that , it 's confidential . - Clients are not friends , Otis .
 Fine . You invite Rahim and some of your Swing Band friends .
 I 'll invite you and Lily , and we can have a totally spontaneous , super- small , chill gathering at my house tonight .
 Without a chicken ?
 Without a chicken .
 Hey , Lily . How are you doing ?
 I have to be somewhere else .
 [ Ola exhales sharply ]
 Otis , you can 't be mad at both of them .
 I can . Maeve ruined my relationship ,
 - and Ola broke up with me , so ...
 - Uh , that 's a little extreme .
 - You should invite Maeve to your party .
 - No , it 's a small gathering .
 Uh , you can have a couple of drinks , clear the air . I know you want to .
 - I do not want her there . - [ Eric groans in frustration ]
 I feel bad about Maeve .
 We spoke about this , Steve .
 She was too much of a risk and she doesn 't take this seriously . At least Paulina is reliable .
 I can hear you .
 Hey , Viv . I loved that meme you sent me last night .
 - It was hilarious . - I know . Cats playing Scrabble , gets me every time .

 [ Viv laughs ]
 Polly .
 Prawn cocktail ?
 No .
 I can 't deal with the smell of fish before lunch .
 - Anyway , how long until the heat ?
 - Um ...
 We have 25 minutes of free time before the minibus leaves .
 - Great . I might go and do some push- ups .
 - Okay . I 'll get on with some practice .
 I am going to go to the bathroom .
 Polly , I can smell it from here .
 [ Eric ]
 Okay . Party at Otis Milburn 's tonight .
 - But it 's a Thursday . - BYO booze .
 We can 't be hungover at rehearsals .
 Hi .
 Um , party at Otis Milburn 's tonight .
 It 's a Thursday .
 - Thursday 's the new Friday . - No , Wednesday is the new Saturday .
 - Everybody knows that . - Can I come to the party ?
 No , Rahim . I 've disgraced us .
 I didn 't realize you were going , Rahim . Uh , where 's Otis 's house then ?
 Uh , 43 Ashford Street .
 BYO booze .
 Bye . Your hair is majestic .
 You 're not actually going to a party on a Thursday , are you ?
 Thursdays are the new Fridays , Olivia . Get with the program .
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 My boyfriend wants to have anal sex .
 I told him I 've done it before , but I haven 't , and I 'm freaking out .
 Okay , well , um ... what exactly are you afraid of ?
 I don 't know how to douche .
 I 've looked it up online . Every website says something different .
 Listen to me , I cannot , under any circumstances , shit myself .
 Let me do some research , and I 'll get back to you .
 Also , I 'm having a small gathering of friends at my house tonight ,
 - if you 'd like to come ... - What the fuck 's a " small gathering " ?
 [ stammering ] It 's ... a small group ...
 - Be quick with the research , yeah ?
 - [ Eric ] Hey . Hey , guys .
 Um ...
 - weird question .
 - Uh- huh .
 What do you know about anal douching ?
 Um , not much to be honest , Otis . I know about this , I 'll teach you .
 - Hi , Claire .
 - Hey .

 - [ door slams open ]
 - [ groaning ]
 - [ Paulina ] Oh , my God ! Oh , my God !
 - [ diarrhea squelching ]
 Hello ?
 [ loud groan ]
 Are you okay in there ?
 [ groaning ]
 It was the prawn cocktail sandwich . [ Paulina ]
 We need you back . Paulina 's got food poisoning ,
 - and she wasn 't very good anyway . - It 's true , you were so much better .
 She always said " pacific " instead of " specific , " and didn 't know marsupials have pouches .
 Okay , fine . Please will you come back ?
 But you can 't go rogue , okay ?
 [ phone ringing ]
 Jean speaking .

 - Hello , Michelle .



 Well , firstly , my research is confidential and secondly , Remi is grossly mistaken .
 I will not be writing with him again .

 Because he is a colossal twat .
 [ knocking at door ]
 - Oh , hello , Ola . - Hi .
 Have a seat .
 So , Dad told me you guys aren 't seeing each other anymore .
 Well , at least ... it might make it easier for you and Otis now .
 Oh , we broke up too .
 Oh , I 'm so sorry .
 He didn 't tell you ?
 Well , he doesn 't tell me much these days , and ...
 Well , sometimes I wonder if it would 've been easier if I 'd had a girl .
 Girls can be pretty annoying too .
 [ sighs ]
 You know , if you ever need to talk to a woman about anything ...
 [ sighs ]
 What would you do if you really liked someone , and you were so sure they liked you too , but all of a sudden they 're acting like they find you completely revolting ?
 Douching is not essential if you eat a lot of fiber and empty your bowels regularly .
 - Huh .
 - Hmm .
 If you 've never douched before , it might be best to start with a simple bulb , like that .
 So , water in the bulb ... [ Rahim continues ]
 If I 'm not cooking a roast chicken , what are people going to eat ?
 Crisps .
 Otis , just crisps . ... for as long as you can , sit on the toilet ... and release .
 - What about dips ? - No dips .
 - But my guac is ...
 - Just listen to Rahim . ... and protective mucus in your anus .
 - Boys ! - Hey !
 Let 's see the hand .
 - Glad to have you back , Marchetti . - Cheers , man .
 Sir , my cast came off this morning and I 'm back training this week .
 Amazing news . Congratulations .
 So , I 'm not gonna be able to make dress rehearsals tomorrow night .
 Jackson , this is show business , all right ?
 Not no- show business . Just rearrange training .
 It 's my mum , sir . She wants me back in the pool as soon as possible .
 I 'm sure she 'll understand . It 's great to have more than one passion .
 Talk to her , okay ?
 [ Rahim ] Squat , don 't rush , push it in , compress the bulb .
 - [ door opens ] - Pull to take it out .
 What 's going on ?
 I 'm teaching Otis how to douche .
 - But we 're leaving , actually . - Yeah . Yeah , sorry .
 [ Mr. Hendricks ]
 Okay .
 [ laughs ]
 Thank you .



 Squeeze , hold , release .
 - I 'll pick you up at your house . - I can meet you at the party .
 - Small gathering . - Yeah , but I wanna see where you live .
 Okay .
 [ chuckles ]
 What 's the matter ?
 I 've just never had anyone meet my family before .
 I still think that you should invite her .
 No .
 - What ... - No . I 'll see you later .
 I don 't want to see any roast chicken !
 Hey , Maeve . [ chuckles ]
 Um , I think you should come to Otis 's party tonight .
 - I didn 't get an invite . - But I know he wants you there .
 - [ sighs ] - I think that you two really need to talk .
 He didn 't mean what he said in the text .
 Please ? Just talk to him .
 I 'll think about it , okay ?
 Okay .
 [ sighs ]
 See you later . Bye .
 [ whispering ]
 Okay .
 What are you ...
 Okay , what are you doing , Mum ? What are you doing ?
 [ normal ]
 Ooh !
 - Otis . - Mum .
 - Are you okay ? - Yeah . I 'm just , uh ...
 - I was waiting for you to get back . - Oh .
 I 'm thinking of having some friends over tonight .
 Oh .
 - A party ? - No .
 Just a gathering .
 Um ...
 But I was thinking maybe if you could not be there ?
 Oh . Oh , I see . Uh , yeah .
 It 's not personal .
 - No . - It 's just ...
 - Of course not . - You know ?
 You 're asserting your independence from your primary care giver .
 It 's perfectly normal .
 I will make myself scarce .
 - Otis ? - Yeah ?
 You know you can talk to me about anything ?
 [ " Betrayal Takes Two " by Richard Hell and the Voidoids playing ]
 Yeah , I know .
 - Bye , darling .
 - See ya .
 - [ locker closes loudly ]

 What are you doing tonight ?
 Remember , whoever wins this heat gets a place in the televised finals , where all your friends , families , and university recruiters will get a chance to see your giant brains in widescreen high definition .
 Maeve , you are not a lone wolf . We play as a team today .
 A winning team .
 Okay .
 I talked to Coach earlier .
 They said there 's every chance you could be back on track for the Nationals .
 Obviously , we 'll take it slowly , but ...
 Well , maybe Jackson doesn 't want to talk about swimming right now .
 You mean don 't want to talk about it .
 Uh , that 's not what I said .
 - It 's what you 're implying . - Everything 's fine , okay ?
 I 'm fine , the hand 's fine , everything is fine . Let 's just drop it , okay ?
 [ knock at door ]
 I 'll get it .
 Lovely to meet you , Mrs. Effiong .
 - [ Eric ]
 Ooh .
 - [ laughs ]
 - Eric , who is your friend ? - I 'm Eric 's boyfriend .
 Oh .
 - Lovely to meet you ... - Rahim .
 Rahim .
 Eric , why didn 't you say you had a boyfriend ?
 - Would you like to come in ... - No , no , no !
 Mum , we 're in a rush , and we need to go now .
 Don 't be late . It 's a Thursday .
 - Your family know you 're gay , right ? - Yeah .
 [ scoffs ]
 I came out when I was 13 .
 So , why don 't you tell your parents about me then ?
 Well , we 're just not a very talkative family .
 Come on . We 're gonna be late .
 - We 're gonna be late ? - Yeah , we 're gonna be late .
 - Yeah . - Yeah , late .
 [ host ]
 Last question , and for a place in the final , according to the Department of Health , what is the most common drug used in the UK ?
 - [ buzz ] - Ibuprofen .
 - Incorrect . - [ groans ]
 Fuck .
 Quiz Heads , over to you .
 I think it 's marijuana .
 It 's not a legal drug . It 's paracetamol , trust me .
 [ coughs ] Weed .
 The answer is ... paracetamol .
 And the Moordale Quiz Heads are through to the final .
 [ crowd cheering ]
 - Yes ! Get in ! - Come on !
 Well done .
 I definitely would have said weed .
 Have you ever done magic mushrooms ?
 I 'm not sure I should answer that .
 When the others arrive , I 'll put out the rest of the snacks .
 Maybe we can play some charades .
 So , did Eric invite you ?
 I heard there was a big party at your house .
 I thought I might get to hang out with your mum .
 Oh , God .
 [ sighs ]
 [ doorbell chimes ]
 That must be Eric .
 I told him to bring a cheese board .
 [ sniffs ]
 - [ Otis ] Hi , Debbie . Hi .
 - You all right ?
 [ Otis ] Oh , yeah .
 Okay , um ...
 Oh , um ...
 Excuse me , um ...
 What ?
 Oh , God !
 [ woman ] I can 't believe it .
 [ woman 2 ] Who 's gonna be there ?
 [ woman ] Well , I hope Jamie and Joel .
 [ laughing ]
 - Who even told you about Otis 's party ? - Trom- boner .
 [ scanner beeps ]
 Adam ?
 Didn 't you get expelled ?
 [ whispering ] I heard he has a huge dick .
 [ normal ] Thanks , Adam .
 [ girls laughing ]
 [ door opens , closes ]
 [ door opens ]
 - Hi , my babies . - Hi , Mum .
 You been crying ?
 Huh ?
 Allergies .
 [ chuckles ]
 These bloody plants are trying to kill me , I think .
 Good job they 're pretty , eh ?
 How was school ?
 I got back on the quiz team .
 And we 're going to the finals .
 Oh .
 [ clears throat ] And I have two tickets for family .
 And it would mean a lot if you could be there .
 - Yeah , of course I 'll be there .
 - Cool .
 Why are you all dressed up ?
 I 'm going to a party .
 Who 's the boy then ?
 No , there 's no boy , Mum .
 - I 'll see you later . - What 's his name ?
 Stop it ! There 's no boy .
 - Bye , Els .
 - [ kissing ]
 Mmm .
 [ chuckling ] Stop !
 Bye .
 - I thought you were busy tonight . - I am .
 - I 'm going to a party . - Can I come ?
 No .
 You don 't know what you 're missing .
 I 'm really fun at parties , people can 't get enough of me .
 - I thought we were friends now .
 - What ?
 What made you think that ?
 I 'm not spending another night stuck inside with my brother .
 Seriously , my brain 's a precious commodity , and it 's slowly dying from boredom .
 Don 't let it die , Maeve .
 Please ? Please ?
 Oh , my God . Okay , fine !
 - Do I have time to change my shirt ?
 - No .
 Also , all of our brains are slowly dying .
 You 're not unique .
 Oh , my goodness . I 'm terrible at making decisions .
 I usually just have what Michael 's having .
 [ chuckles ] I mean ,
 I used to have what Michael was having .
 Well , do what I do sometimes : close your eyes and point .
 - [ laughs ] Okay . - It works .
 What can I get you ?
 I 'll have a three- legged monkey , please .
 - [ laughs ]
 - [ Maureen ]
 Oh !
 - And you ? - I 'll have one of those too .
 - [ Jean ] Thank you .
 - [ chuckles ]
 Yes , being on your own will get easier , I promise .
 Before you know it , you 'll be wondering how you ever shared the TV remote .
 I hope so .
 How 's your ... man friend ?
 Um ... we split up , actually .
 Oh , I 'm sorry . What happened ?
 [ sighs ]
 I think I realized I 'd become too independent for relationships . Hmm .
 I sometimes get worried that I 'm going to end up
 - like my poor old Auntie Gladys . - What happened to her ?
 She choked to death on a microwave dinner .
 - What ? - Nobody found her for two weeks .
 [ gasps ] Really ?
 [ laughing ]
 - Thank you . - Thank you .
 Well , here 's to Auntie Gladys then . To Auntie Gladys .

 - Excuse me . - Hey !
 - Eric ? Hi ! I am going to kill you .
 - Hey .
 Why ? I didn 't invite this many people .
 - Is Ola here ? - Why would Ola be here ?
 - We have broken up . - Okay .
 I thought the whole point of this was for you to show Ola that you 're chill .
 - Should I get you both drinks ? - Yeah .
 Yeah , Otis needs a drink . Okay , dude .
 Dude ... this is the closest to cool in sixth form you 're ever gonna get .
 Enjoy it , okay ?
 En- joy- ment .
 - Here it is . - Thank you .
 Chin- chin .
 Ooh .
 Wow , wow , wow , wow , wow , wow , wow .
 [ exhales nervously ]

 [ Isaac ]
 Well , this isn 't exactly disability- friendly , is it ?
 - Yeah , well you wanted to come .
 - And you didn 't think about these stairs versus wheelchair situation .
 I 'm sorry .
 - Let 's just go home . - I 'm not going home .
 I 'm here to par- tay .
 But that does mean you 're gonna have to carry me down these stairs .
 - Are you joking ? - Does it look like I 'm joking ?
 Hello , kind sir .
 Would you be so generous as to escort me and my chair down these ridiculous steps ?
 - I just had a cast taken off , so I can 't .
 - No , it 's fine .
 [ Isaac ] I 'm sensing a hint of tension here .
 Did you guys used to go out or something ?
 - So , who broke whose heart ?
 - Shut up , Isaac .
 Boys .
 - Could you give us a hand getting ...
 - Isaac . - ... Isaac a lift downstairs , please ? - Sure .
 - Enjoy the party , Isaac . - Grab a corner , boys . One , two ...
 So , I 'm assuming it was you who was the breaker of hearts then .
 Okay , we 're done here .
 Hey , Jackson ! Are you looking forward to the dress rehearsal tomorrow ?
 - Oh , man . You ...
 - Mate , he 's not doing that gay Shakespeare shit .
 Look , he 's back in the pool .
 Ruby is looking banging tonight .
 You could never .
 Fuck off , Marchetti .
 [ Viv ] Dex is here .
 - Um , hi . - I don 't have time for " hi " .
 I know I need to go talk to him , but I don 't know how .
 Well , just go up to him and say , " Hey , Dex , " and ask him about his day or a game that he likes or another nerdy- type thing you lot like talking about .
 Then you keep chatting and see where the night takes you . Easy .
 Be yourself , all right ? And you 'll be fine .
 I just realized that your cast is gone . That 's great news .
 Yeah , back to prison for me .
 I 'm joking . Go and get your man .
 - Is that Maeve ? Why is Maeve here ? - I kind of invited her .
 - What ? - You guys need to talk .
 I 'm not talking to her . She can talk to me .
 Who is that guy ?
 - No idea .
 - This isn 't really my scene , to be honest .
 What 's your scene then ? Uh ...
 I don 't know . Reading a book somewhere alone .
 People need people .
 Is that another NA motivational quote by any chance ?
 No , more of a core value , actually .
 Who 's the intense starey guy ?
 That 's Otis .
 It 's his party . Things are a bit weird between us right now .
 - Is he your boyfriend ? - No .
 But you wanted him to be your boyfriend ?
 - You 're not actually psychic , you know .
 - But I 'm pretty close , right ?
 Don 't tell me , you didn 't think he would be my type .
 No , I think he 's exactly your type .
 I bet he 's funny and charming in a sweet , non- threatening way .
 In fact , he looks a little bit like me , but less interesting , which means I must really , really be your type then .
 Shut up !
 - [ Aimee ] Hiya . - Hiya .
 - This is my friend , Isaac . - Hiya , Isaac .
 - Why are you in a wheelchair ? - [ Maeve ] Babes , no .
 - You 're not supposed ... - It 's fine .
 It was a horrendous incident involving the wind .
 Fuck off .
 Forty- three quintillion possible combinations , but in theory , it can be solved in just 20 moves .
 Interesting .
 Uh , Viv , can I ask you something ?
 Which is your favorite color ?
 Oh , probably seafoam green .
 No , on the cube ?
 Sometimes when I 'm in the supermarket ...
 - Mm . - ... I like looking at people ...
 Mm . ... and imagine having sex with them .
 Oh .
 Last week ,
 I had this fantasy about the man who teaches my Zumba class .
 And then , what ... So what was the fantasy ?
 I was on the dance floor ... and he was standing up at the bar .
 - We caught eyes .
 - Oh .
 And then , all of a sudden , we 're having rampant sex at the back of the dance floor .
 - Oh , we should go dancing . - It was only a fantasy .
 No , I know but let 's go dancing .
 - Yeah . - Yeah .
 - Let 's go dancing . - Let 's go dancing .
 Dancing .
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 I didn 't know you were having a party .
 - You didn 't invite me . - Oh , hi , Ola .
 It was very spontaneous .
 Just ... casual . It was a chill decision .
 - You know . - You said you wanted me to come and pick up some stuff .

 Yes , I ... Yeah , so ... [ burps ]
 You left a T- shirt .
 [ burps ] And a ... mug with our faces on it that you bought me .
 I don 't want it anymore .
 Okay .
 - And some tools . Your dad left tools . - [ Ola ]
 Okay .
 It 's upstairs .
 - [ Anwar ] About that research . - [ exclaims ]
 Nick wants to go home and have sex because your party 's pathetic , and I cannot have an unclean arsehole , okay ?
 - Sure . I spoke with Rahim about it . - You told Rahim ?
 I did not tell Rahim about you , okay ?
 I am a very professional .
 Rahim said ...
 Rahim said ...
 Rahim said ...
 You squat .
 You squat .
 [ retching ]
 And release .
 I think you should go .
 - I live here . - I don 't care .
 Okay .
 I 'm gonna get another drink . This one has sick in it .

 Arsehole .
 [ toilet flushing ]
 - Why do you keep avoiding me ? - I 'm not .
 Listen ,
 I 'm sorry about the kiss thing . I didn 't mean to upset you .
 Can we just go back to the way we were before ?
 I don 't think we can be friends anymore .
 It 's too confusing .
 Wait ! Lily , can we just talk ?
 Lily !
 Marchetti , I 'm gonna smash you in practice this week .
 [ breathing rapidly ]
 Oh , fuck .
 Ooh .
 [ sighs ] [ rapid breathing continues ]
 There you are . You need to rescue me from Dex .
 What you doing ?
 I did it to myself .
 I put my hand under the weight because I wanted it to stop , and then it did stop and it felt amazing , but now ... it 's starting again , and it feels like my head 's about to explode if it doesn 't stop .
 I just need it to stop , like ... [ exhales forcefully ]
 - What to stop ? - This fucking pressure .
 [ sighs ]
 It 's okay .
 But you can 't keep on hurting yourself .
 What are you gonna say happened this time ?
 That I got into a fight .
 But I didn 't do it , so ...
 And I 'm not gonna do it , right ? I know it was dumb , so ...
 Sorry , I don 't know why I 'm telling you all this .
 You need to tell your parents what you did .
 Don 't be stupid . They would never understand .
 I 'm not being stupid .
 Statistically , people that self- harm are nine times more likely to attempt taking their own lives .
 You need to get professional help .
 I don 't need professional help .
 I just need to tell them that I 'm not doing what they want anymore .
 You self- harm , Jackson .
 - And the statistics show ...
 - I don 't care about your fucking statistics , Viv !
 What is wrong with you ?
 [ Jackson scoffs ]
 You say you don 't have any friends because you 're busy , but it 's actually because you 're a fucking robot .
 Thanks a lot , Jackson .
 That 's good to know .
 [ door opens ]
 [ door closes ]
 Fuck .
 [ upbeat music playing ]
 Is this helping you get over him ?
 [ " Theme From S Express " by S 'Express playing ]
 Oh , my God , Steve . This is our song .
 - We don 't have a song . - Oh , maybe it was me and Kyle 's song .
 But still , it 's a great song .

 - Hey . - Hey .
 Are you alright ?
 - Dude , I ... I think you 've had enough . - Eric ...
 No .
 Him . Do you think that 's her boyfriend ?
 I ... I don 't know , Otis .
 [ Eric ] Otis , that 's straight vodka .
 Jackson . You came .
 I didn 't think you would come to my party . I was gonna cook a chicken , but I didn 't .
 Or did I ?
 Why do you hate me ?
 You do know Maeve broke up with me because she 's in love with you , right ?
 And you 're still not with her .
 Enjoy the clean up , yeah ?
 Hey !
 I 'm Otis . Some people call me O- Town .
 - No , they don 't . - I 'm sure they do .
 Maeve and I aren 't really speaking , but I can talk to you .
 And we can dance ' cause dancing isn 't talking .
 Ah .
 Ah .
 You want some vodka ?
 Ah- ha .
 You want some ?
 Hey !
 [ music slows , distorts ]
 [ music plays normally ]

 - Aimee .
 - Don 't touch me , Steve . I don 't like you touching me anymore .
 - But I 'm your boyfriend . - I ... I don 't ...
 I don 't think I want a boyfriend . I 'm sorry .
 [ " Freed From Desire " by Gala playing ]
















 Woo !
 [ distant chatter , laughter ] [ " Don 't Go " by Yazoo playing ] [ indistinct chatter ]
 [ Eric ] Drunk Otis is a monster .
 He 's a monster . Demonic .
 Hey , Mr. Squat and Release ... [ chuckles ]
 ... how come you haven 't asked me to go all the way ?
 I don 't want to put any pressure on you .
 Whenever you 're ready .
 [ Eric laughs ]

 What is he doing here ?
 I don 't know .

 I 'm sorry . I 'll be right back .
 [ Anwar ] Hey , can I talk to you ?
 It 's really awkward , but I 've been told you know about it already .
 So ... you see , I need to know how to ... douche .
 Why can 't you talk to your boyfriend about this ?
 Look , I 'm ready to lose my virginity , but it 's embarrassing .
 If you are not ready to talk about douching with your boyfriend , you 're definitely not ready to have his cock in your arse .
 Wait !
 You stopped coming to the window .
 Yeah , I did .
 What did I do wrong ?
 You bullied me for years , Adam .
 You made me feel unsafe for years .
 You were one of the main reasons I wasn 't kind to myself .
 And I 'm supposed to believe that you 've suddenly changed ?
 You 're full of shame , man , and I can 't be in that place anymore .
 I 've had to work really hard to love myself , and I won 't go back
 - to hiding things about me again .
 - I 'm scared .
 And I think I 'm bisexual .
 Are you all right ?
 You can 't even hold my hand .
 - Rahim can hold my hand . - I feel like everyone hates me .
 Well , it 's kind of hard to like someone who doesn 't like themselves .
 [ sighs ]
 [ girl moaning ]
 Found it .
 [ both moaning ]
 [ Ola ] Hey , Otis .
 Otis .
 I 've got my stuff , I 'm leaving .
 Okay . Bye , Ola .
 You invited her but not me .
 No , I didn 't invite her . Eric invited her without my knowledge .
 I didn 't want her here at all .
 I think I 'm going to go too .
 Maeve , Ola . Stay , please . Please stay .
 I have something to tell you . I have something to tell both of you .
 I 'm gonna tell everyone because ...
 I can .
 [ grunts ]
 Sorry , Connor .
 Excuse me , everyone ! Everyone , come and look at me .
 I have an announcement to make .
 Can we turn the music down ? Um , I wanna say something ...
 - [ music quietens ] - to my party guests .
 Um , so , this is Ola .
 I don 't know if you know her .
 She 's well , quite little and ... and funny , and interesting , and pretty , and she was my girlfriend until she told me I can 't see Maeve anymore .
 Now , we all know Maeve . Scary Maeve .
 You know , she 's not actually scary . She 's just pretending .
 - Anyway ...
 - [ laughs ]
 Maeve told me that she liked me , okay ?
 And I like Maeve .
 I like Maeve a lot , a lot more than I liked Ola .
 - Otis . Otis , get off ...
 - But I was trying to be a good boyfriend , so I said to Maeve , " Sorry , I can 't see you anymore . "
 And then , Ola dumped me .
 Yeah , it 's confusing . I was confused .
 But I thought probably a good thing
 ' cause I just really wanted to be with Maeve .
 And I didn 't really want to be with Ola , and then I realized
 Maeve Wiley just likes playing with people 's feelings , and she doesn 't care about anyone else .
 Like , she brought this ... man with her .
 I don 't know , probably just here to make me jealous .
 - Definitely didn 't work .
 - [ whispers ] It definitely did .
 [ Otis ] All in all ,
 I think she 's probably the most selfish person I 've ever met .
 And I think it 's good that I 'm not going out with either of them because I think I deserve a whole lot more .
 Thank you for coming . Good night .
 Not good night . Stay , enjoy yourselves .
 Music on , please !
 [ music starts ]
 You 're welcome to him .
 - What is her problem ? - You 're an arsehole .
 Hey !
 [ " Good Love 6- 9- 9- 6- 9 " by Isaac Hayes playing ]
 Eh- oooh !
 [ Nick ] Shall we go , An ?
 Uh , you know what ? I think I 'm gonna stay for a bit , actually .
 Okay , alright .
 [ sighs ] Hey , um ...
 I hope I didn 't put any pressure on you about having sex .
 We don 't have to do anything you don 't want to do .
 No , yeah , I know . Thanks .
 Right . Well , I 'll see you later .
 Okay . See you .
 Nick ?
 I do want to have sex with you .
 I 've just never done it before .
 And I don 't know how to douche .
 [ chuckles ]
 You should have said .
 Anwar , I didn 't know how to do any of that stuff either .
 I 'll show you if you want ?
 - Okay . - Okay ?
 - Yeah . - All right .
 Let 's go .
 [ muttering angrily ]
 [ grunting ]
 Jesus .
 - What are you doing here ? - I didn 't want to go home .
 Why 'd you throw your shoe at me ?
 I 'm angry .
 Do you wanna go smash some shit ?
 Yeah , all right . [ timer dings ]

 - [ Maeve ]
 I can 't wait around . - [ Isaac ] But you 'll have to ...
 - [ Maeve ] Fuck 's sake . - [ Isaac ]
 Sorry .
 Very generous of you .

 [ Isaac ] Pirouetting .
 Lovely .
 [ chuckles ]
 Okay .
 What really happened ?
 No wind , or youths , or Afghan dogs this time .
 All right .
 - Um ...
 Yeah , I was ten .
 - Mm- hmm . Joe and I were still living with our parents .
 They would send us out so they could get high .
 Anyway , on this particular day , I dared Joe to climb up this massive tree , and he chickened out halfway up .
 So , of course , I wanted to prove that I was braver and get all the way up to the top , which I did .
 And then I fell .
 That 's it . That 's the story .
 Do you blame your parents ?
 No .
 I sometimes blame them for not sticking with the parenting thing , though .
 Yeah , that bit kind of sucked .
 Okay , well , I 've got one for you .
 Behold . I was eight .
 My mum didn 't take me to school .
 She used to sleep a lot back then .
 I tried to make myself beans on toast .
 My brother had to call an ambulance .
 Must 've been some hot beans .
 [ laughs ]
 Yeah .
 Anyway , that 's mine .
 That Otis guy wouldn 't understand this shit .
 He wouldn 't get it . It 's not in his little world .
 - Otis has got family problems too . - That 's different .
 If you grow up knowing the people who are meant to make sure you survive just left you ... it leaves a lot of scars .
 But those scars make you special .
 And you and I are properly special .
 And for the record , I 'm sorry about what I said about your mum .
 I think I was just jealous that someone came back for you .
 - Now , off to bed , you . - [ laughs ] Okay .
 - Wake the neighbors up though .
 - [ laughs ]
 - Thanks for tonight , it was fun .
 - Yeah .
 - Bye . - Hurry along now .

 - [ Isaac ] Fare thee well .
 - Hmm .


 Oh , hello .
 This is actually pretty good .
 How was it with the boy ?
 Anti- climactic .
 I think I wanna concentrate on myself for a while .
 That 's my girl .
 You 're too smart to go chasing silly boys around .
 That was where things went wrong for me .
 You want to wait until they 're men . They 've got a bit of something about 'em .
 [ laughing ]
 That 's good advice , Mum .
 - Don 't put your boots on the sofa .
 - All right .
 Now , where was I ?
 [ laughing ]
 [ Roz ] Jackson ,
 - come in here . - Sorry !
 I know I 'm past curfew .
 I had to tell them .
 [ panting ]
 - You sure you 're ready ? - Yeah , I 'm ready .
 [ gasps ]
 Are you drunk ?
 A little bit .
 I went dancing with Jean Milburn .
 It was fun .
 Take me back , Maureen .
 We 've talked about this .
 What 's she been telling you about me ?
 Nothing I didn 't already know .
 Good night , Michael .
 [ door closes ]
 Great party , Mrs. Milburn .
 Where 's Otis ?
 Pfft .
