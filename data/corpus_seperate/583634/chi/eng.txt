 - That girl totally winked at me ! - She did not wink at you .
 You always think somebody 's winking at you .
 The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy
 I have to say " Tupelo Honey " by Van Morrison . No way !
 The most romantic song ever was " The Way We Were . "
 I think the one that Elton John wrote for that guy on Who 's the Boss ? What song was that , Pheebs ?
 Hold me close Young Tony Danza

 - Hi , Monica .
 - Hi , Mon .
 Hey , Mon . Oh , my God !
 - Has she slept at all ?
 - No . - It 's been three nights in a row .
 - She finally stopped crying yesterday .
 But then she found one of Richard 's cigar butts on the terrace ...
 Okay , that explains it .
 I got a call at 2 in the morning ... ... and all I could hear was this squeaky sound .
 So I thought : " It 's , like , a mouse or a possum . "
 Then I realized , like :
 " Okay , where would a mouse or a possum get the money to make the phone call ? "
 - Morning .
 - Morning .
 You made pancakes ?
 Yeah , like there 's any way I could ever do that .
 Monica and Rachel had syrup
 Now I can get my man to cheer up
 - Good morning , Joey .
 - Good morning .
 Someone 's wearing grumpy pants .
 It 's gotta be you , man . I 'm wearing smarty- pants .
 Okay , here we go :
 One , two ... ... and here 's my chance to give you a third one .
 - Joey ? - No , no .
 I 'll just have juice .
 Why don 't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me ?
 Oh , I wish .
 You have that report to finish , and I 've gotta go see my lawyer .
 I can 't believe I date a girl who 's getting divorced . I 'm such a grownup .
 Joey ! Hey !
 Go to your room !
 Chandler ! Hey !
 Up yours ! I gotta go , I gotta go .
 Not without a kiss . Maybe I won 't kiss you so you 'll stay . Kiss her .

 Kiss her !
 I 'll see you later , sweetie .
 Bye , Joey .
 Bye- bye , Janice . So when are you dumping her ?
 Nope . Not this time .
 Come on , quit yanking me . I 'm not yanking you .
 - This is Janice .
 - Yeah , I know .
 She makes me happy .
 Okay .
 All right .
 You look me in the eye and tell me , without blinking ... ... that you 're not breaking up with her .
 No blinking . I 'm not breaking up with her !



 God , look what I found in the drain !
 What ?
 It 's some of Richard 's hair ! What do I do with this ? Getting it away from me would be job one .
 It 's weird , but I don 't want to throw this away .
 I mean , this is all I have left of him .
 Gross ... ... drain hair .

 Cool !
 It looks like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal .
 God , what is wrong with me ?
 - You need to get some sleep .
 - I need to get some Richard .

 You broke up with him for a reason .
 I know .
 I know . I 'm just so tired of missing him .
 I 'm tired of wondering why he hasn 't called .
 Why hasn 't he called ?
 Maybe because you told him not to ?
 What are you , the Memory Woman ? They 're not breaking up ! Chandler and Janice ?
 They 're not breaking up !
 He didn 't blink or anything ! I 'm not surprised .
 Have you seen them together ? - They 're really cute .
 - " Cute " ? This is Janice ! You remember Janice ?
 Yes , I remember .
 She 's annoying .
 But you know what ?
 She 's his girlfriend now .
 I mean , what can we do ?
 There you go !
 That 's the spirit I 'm looking for !
 " What can we do ? "
 All right , who 's first , huh ?
 Ross ?
 I think Chandler 's our friend , and Janice makes him happy .
 So I say we all be adult about it and accept her .
 We 'll call that " Plan B , " all right ?
 Come on , people ! We need some inspiration . Okay , all right .
 You want a plan ?
 Here we go :
 So , Ross , you go in through the air duct and disable the alarm , okay ?
 Then the rest of us will rappel down ropes .
 We 're in and out in 10 minutes and disappear into the night .
 Huh ?




 Honey ... ... I was wondering ...
 Do you still have that Navy uniform ?
 No , I had to return it to the costume place .
 I think I have an old band uniform from high school .
 You remember not having sex in high school , right ?
 - Well , honey , what about you ?
 - What ?
 Do you have any fun , you know , fantasy- type things ?
 No .
 Come on .
 You gotta have one . Nope .
 - Ross . You know what ? - What ?
 If you tell me , I might do it .


 Did you ever see Return of the Jedi ?


 Do you remember the scene ... ... with Jabba the Hutt ?
 He was this really fat worm guy .
 Wow .
 Men and women really are different .
 No . No . No .
 See , Jabba had as his prisoner ... ... Princess Leia .

 Princess Leia was wearing ... ... this gold bikini thing .
 It was pretty cool .
 So are you saying that you would like me ... ... to dress up like Princess Leia ... ... in a gold bikini ?

 Okay .
 Princess Leia and the gold bikini ?
 Every guy our age loved that .
 Really ?
 It 's huge !
 That 's the moment when she stopped being a princess ... ... and she became , like , you know , a woman .
 - Did you ever do the Leia thing ?
 - Oh , yeah .
 Really ?
 That great , huh ?
 No , it 's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate .


 See you .
 - Hey .
 - Hi , you guys !
 Look who I found standing outside the Szechuan Dragon ... ... staring at a parking meter .




 - Why aren 't you at work ?
 - Oh , they sent me home . Why ?
 Because I don 't work at the Szechuan Dragon .
 - You really need to get some sleep . - I know I do . - Guess what ?
 They published my paper . - Really ? " Statistical Deviations in the Carbon Dating ... ... of Fossilized Algae :
 History or Mystery ? "
 Rach , look !

 Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me ?
 There he is !


 - Wheel ! - Of ! Fortune !
 This guy 's so stupid .
 It 's Count Rushmore !
 You know , you should really go on this show .
 Listen , I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight .
 - What do you say ?
 - I say I am there ! Cool !
 - Is Ross going too ? - No . Janice .
 Janice ?
 Because I just feel bad for Ross , you know ? We always go together .
 We 're , like , the Three Hockey- teers , you know ?
 I may be way out on a limb here , but do you have a problem with Janice ?
 No ! Yes ...
 Oh , God , how do I say this ?

 You know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
 That girl that I hate ?
 She drives me crazy .
 Look , I don 't hate Janice . She 's just a lot to take , you know ?
 - Well , there you go .
 - Come on , don 't look at me like that .
 She used to drive you nuts before too , remember ?
 I 'm crazy about her now . I think this could be the real thing .
 Capital R , capital T !
 Don 't worry , those are the right letters .
 Look , what do you want me to say ?
 - I want you to say that you like her ! - I can 't .
 - Like her ! - No .
 So you 're not even gonna try ? What 's the point ?
 It 's like this chemical thing , you know ?
 Every time she starts laughing , I just wanna ... ... pull my arm off just so I have something to throw at her .
 Thanks for trying .
 Oh , and by the way , there is no Count Rushmore !
 Yeah ? Then who 's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain ?


 How could you have told her ? I didn 't think it would be that big a deal !
 She didn 't think it would be that big a deal ! Who are you talking to when you do that ?
 Look , that was supposed to be a private , personal thing between us .
 Phoebe is my girlfriend , okay ?
 We tell each other everything . I mean , come on !
 Guys do the same thing .
 What about all that locker- room stuff ? That 's different .
 That 's like , who dated a stripper ? Or who did it on the back of the Staten Island ferry ?
 - Both of those Joey ?
 - Yeah . But you don 't talk about your girlfriend ... ... and the intimate stuff you do with her .

 - Not even with your best friend ? - No . That is so sad .
 You 're missing out on so much .
 I mean , the bonding and the sharing ... ... and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are .
 So , what , you tell each other everything ?
 Pretty much .
 Did you talk about the night of five times ?

 Do you tell people about the night of five times ?
 Honey , that was with Carol . I know , but it 's still worth mentioning , I think .

 Relax every muscle in your body .
 Listen to the plinky- plunky music .
 Okay , now close your eyes ... ... and think of a happy place .
 Tell me your happy place .
 Richard 's living room , drinking wine . No , no , no . Not a Richard thing .
 Just put down the glass and get out .
 I 'm sorry , but that 's my happy place .
 Okay , fine .
 Use my happy place . Just don 't move anything in there . I 'll try not to .
 Okay .
 All right , so , you 're in a meadow ... ... millions of stars in the sky ...
 You think breaking up was a mistake ? There are no questions in the happy place .
 Okay .
 Just the warm breeze ... ... and the moonlight flowing through the trees .
 I 'll bet he 's over me . I 'll bet he 's fine .
 Betting and wagering of any kind are not permitted in the happy place .
 There 's just , you know , the lovely waterfalls ... ... and the trickling fountains ... ... and the calming sounds of the babbling brook .
 Okay , this isn 't working . I 'm still awake , and now I have to pee .
 Guess who !

 Janice . Hi . You just missed Chandler ... ... but won 't you come in before you go ?

 So I hear ... ... you hate me !
 I never said " hate . "
 I was very careful about that .
 A little birdie told me you wanted to rip your arm off and throw it at me .
 And you got " hate " from that ?
 You 're taking a big leap there . All right , fine , fine , fine !
 We have got to do something about our little situation here .
 So this is my idea .
 You and me spending some quality time together .
 - But what does that ... ?
 - For Chandler ! Okay .
 I 'm in . Okay ! This is what we 'll call it :
 Joey and Janice 's Day of Fun ! Does it have to be a whole day ?

 Yes , because that 's how long it takes to love me .
 Yeah , I know .
 I sleep in the next room .

 So do you guys all hate Janice too ?
 You hate Janice now ?
 Joey 's gonna be so relieved .

 Oh , my God .
 Oh , my God .
 Well , look , everybody . It 's Weepy :
 " The Mime that Cares Too Much . "
 Then I went down to the post office ... ... and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard ... ... about the Civil War .
 He loved the Civil War .

 Monica , do you want us to take you home ?

 Or maybe to a galaxy far , far away .



 Women tell each other everything ! Did you know that ?
 No , Chandler , everything .
 Like stuff you like . Stuff she likes . Technique .
 Stamina . Girth .
 Girth ?
 Why ? Why ? Why ?
 Why ?
 Why would they do this ?
 Rachel says sharing 's great and supposedly ... ... you know , we ought to be doing it .
 Do you wanna ?
 We 're not gonna talk about girth , are we ?
 - Okay .
 - Yeah ?
 All right , you go first .
 Okay .
 Okay , I 'll go first .
 So the other night ... ... Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies ... ... and I happened to describe a particular ... ... Star Wars thing ...
 - Princess Leia and the gold bikini . - Yes !
 I know ! Well , that was easy .
 - Okay , you go .
 - Okay .
 You know when you 're in bed with a woman ...

 ... and fooling around ... ... and you get all these mental images in your brain ?
 Like Elle MacPherson or the girl at the Xerox place ?
 - With the bellybutton ring ? - I know . And then all of a sudden , your mom pops into your head .
 And you 're like , " Mom , get out of here ! "
 But after that , you can 't think of anything else . And you can 't stop what you 're doing .
 So it 's kind of like you 're ... ... you know ... ... you know ...
 You don 't know !
 Your mom ?
 You 're telling me about your mom ? What is the matter with you ?
 - You said ...
 - I said " share , " not " scare " ! Go sit over there !

 We 're back !
 What are you guys doing together ?
 Joey and Janice 's Day of Fun !
 Really ? We went to a Mets game . We got Chinese food .
 And , you know , I love this woman .
 You have got competition , buddy .
 I just came by to give you a kiss .
 I have to go pick up the baby .
 So I 'll see you later , sweetheart . You too , Chandler .



 - You still can 't stand her , can you ?
 - I 'm sorry , man .
 I tried ! I really did !
 I appreciate you giving it a shot .
 But , you know , the good thing ... ... is that we spent the whole day together and I survived .
 And what 's even more amazing , so did she . It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium .
 - I guess that 's something .
 - Oh , man , that 's huge ! Now I know I can stand to be around her .
 Which means I get to hang out with you .
 Which is kind of the whole point anyway .

 Oh , hey !
 We stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross .

 Oh , God .
 If it makes you feel any better , I do it too .
 - Really ?
 - Oh , yeah !
 I always picture your mom when I 'm having sex .
 April 12 , 1861 .
 The United States garrison at Fort Sumter was fired upon .
 It is now under bombardment by ...
 Dad !
 What are you doing here ?
 It 's your mother 's bridge night , so I came into the city for a Moni- cuddle .
 Since when did you start smoking cigars ?
 I don 't .
 I just like the smell of them .
 So , what are you really doing here ?
 I just wanted to make sure that you 're okay . Why wouldn 't I be okay ?
 I saw Richard .
 So how you doing ? I 'm fine . I 'm just a little tired , but I 'm okay .
 - How 's Richard doing ?
 - You don 't wanna know . No , I really , really do .
 Well , he 's doing terrible !
 Really ?
 Worse than when he broke up with Barbara .
 - You 're not just saying that , are you ?
 - No , the man is a mess !
 - Was he crying ?
 - No .
 Do you think he was waiting till after you left , so he could cry ?
 Maybe .
 I think so .
 Honey , relationships are hard .
 Like with your mom and me .
 You know , after we graduated from college , we broke up for a while .
 It seems her father , your grandfather ... ... wanted her to travel around Europe like he did .
 Of course , he got to do it on Uncle Sam 's nickel ... ... because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time .
 However ...
 Okay , here we go .
 I am Jabba 's prisoner .
 And you ... ... have a really weird look on your face .
 What ?
 Honey , what is it ?
 Did I get the hair wrong ?
 Did you just picture it differently ?
 What ?
 No , no .
 It 's not you .
 It 's ...
 What is it ?
 Come on , sweetie .
 You 're , like , freaking me out here .
 I hate Chandler .
 The bastard ruined my life !
