 00 : 00 : 10, 153 -- > 00 : 00 : 12, 154 Clarify something for me .
 Isn 't the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions ?
 An opportunity to consider important issues of the day ? It is .
 You just kind of put a damper on things when you said , " The next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death . "
 Well , we could argue about who said what all night long , but to set things back on course ,
 I will propose a new topic of conversation . Great .
 What is the best number ? By the way , there 's only one correct answer .
 5, 318, 008 ?
 Wrong .
 The best number is 73 . You 're probably wondering why .
 No .
 Uh- uh .
 We 're good .
 73 is the 21st prime number .
 Its mirror , 37 , is the 12th , and its mirror , 21 , is the product of multiplying -- hang on to your hats -- seven and three .
 Eh ?
 Eh ?
 Did I lie ? We get it .
 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers . Chuck Norris wishes .


 In binary , 73 is a palindrome : " one- zero- zero- one- zero- zero- one " which backwards is " one- zero - zero- one- zero- zero- one " -- exactly the same .
 All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is : " Sirron Kcuhc . "
 Just for the record , when you enter 5, 318, 008 on a calculator , upside- down it spells " boobies "
 Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn 't want to eat with us tonight ? Yeah , I get it now .
 I love your little heart locket , Bernadette .
 Oh , thanks . Howard gave it to me .
 It 's the cutest thing .
 Every time I have dinner with his mom , the next day I get jewelry .
 Did you know that the iconic Valentine 's heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart , but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over ?

 Oh , so I spent seventh grade dotting my I 's with little asses ? Cool .
 Hey , Penny , how 's it going ?
 Hey , Zack , what are you doing here ?
 My dad 's company prints the menus for this place .
 I 'm just dropping off some new ones laminated .
 Makes 'em easier to clean if people throw up on 'em .
 Guess how I got the idea ?
 Yeah , I got it , I got it .
 Uh , Zack , these are my friends Bernadette and Amy .
 - Hi . - Hey . Hoo .

 Okay , well , it was good to see you .
 Yeah , you , too . He 's really cute . How do you know him ?
 Oh , we went out a couple of times .
 I 'm often flummoxed by current slang .
 Does " went out " mean " had intercourse " ?
 Yes . No , no .
 But in this case , yes .
 Interesting . And was it not satisfactory ?
 No , it was great .
 He just didn 't really challenge me on an intellectual level .
 Couldn 't you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR ?
 Wouldn 't help .
 Zack can 't even spell NPR . It 's what I do with Howard .

 I 'm much smarter than he is .
 But it 's important to protect his manhood .
 Hoo .
 What 's the matter ?
 I 'm suddenly feeling flushed .
 My heart rate is elevated , my palms are clammy , my mouth is dry .
 In addition , I keep involuntarily saying " hoo . " Oh , we know what 's causing that , don 't we ?
 It 's no mystery .
 I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden- onset Tourette 's syndrome .

 Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab ?
 No .
 What happened ?
 They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit .
 Did he get superpowers ?
 No , he got five stitches and a tetanus shot .
 Oh .
 Well , that 's disappointing . Why ?
 Well , you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab , you kind of want to turn into a superhero .
 Yeah , but who 'd want to become Rat- Man ?
 Who wouldn 't ?
 You could zip through a maze in nothing flat , squeeze through really small holes , and shut down restaurants in a single bound .
 And the best part is , if I were Rat- Man , you could be my sidekick , Mouse Boy .

 Mouse Boy ?
 You don 't like " Mouse Boy " ?
 How about " Kid Vermin " ?
 First of all , if we had superpowers , I wouldn 't be the sidekick . You 'd be the sidekick .
 Rat- Man is nobody 's sidekick .
 Leonard , settle this .
 Of the two of us , who 's the obvious sidekick ?
 Yeah , Leonard , who ?
 12 years after high school , and I 'm still at the nerd table .
 Aren 't you slicing that man 's brain a little too thin ?

 It 's too thin if I were making a foot- long brain sandwich at Quiznos .
 For examination under a two - photon microscope , it 's fine .
 Well , you 're the expert .
 If the correct way to do it is the wrong way , then I yield . Very well .
 If you die and donate your body to science ,
 I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon . Thank you .
 Now , if you 'll excuse me ,
 I have to take my temperature .
 Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity ?
 I did that one summer . Ah , youth .
 No , I experienced some distressing symptoms last night , so I 'm checking my vital signs every hour .
 I 'd be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis .
 Oh , that sounds like fun . All right .
 What were the symptoms ?
 Elevated heart rate , moist palms , dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing .
 Localized to what region ?
 Ears and genitalia .
 Interesting .
 Not body parts that usually team up .

 What about environmental factors ?
 Describe the scene for me .
 I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette , drinking water -- carbonated as it was a special occasion .
 Penny 's friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said " hoo . "
 Who ? Zack . Then why did you ask ?
 Ask what ? Who .
 Zack .
 All right , let 's start over .
 What did you say when Zack walked in ?
 " Hoo . " Zack .
 Why do you keep saying " Zack " ? Because you keep saying " who . "
 I 'm not saying " hoo " now .
 I said " hoo " last night .
 And the answer was Zack , correct ? There was no question .
 I simply said " hoo . "
 All right , I think I have enough to go on .
 Possible explanations for your symptoms are , in descending order of likelihood : hyperthyroidism , premature menopause , hosting an alien parasite or -- and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases -- sexual arousal .


 Where would I have picked up an alien parasite ?
 There you are . Oh , hey . Let me ask you a question .
 What are you most afraid of ?
 I don 't know . Um ...
 Nuclear war . Accidentally being buried alive .
 Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you 're going to die .
 And then you do .
 No .
 Something very specific that we both know you ,
 Rajesh Koothrappali , are terrified of .
 Well , type two diabetes runs in my family . The thought of losing a toe ... Spiders !
 You 're afraid of spiders !
 What the heck is this ?
 A jar with a big spider in it , of course .
 Bravery test .
 First one to take his hand out is the sidekick .
 Are you crazy ?
 Perhaps .
 Are you scared ?
 No . But it 's a stupid test .
 Oh , really ?
 What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider ?
 Oh , yeah ?
 What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked ?

 Oh , come on . That 's never gonna happen .
 Put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick .
 All right , I will . How did you get so brave all of a sudden ?
 It 's easy . The spider 's crawling up your arm .


 Get it off !
 Get it off !
 Please , Raj !
 Please . Oh !
 My blood work shows thyroid function normal .
 Cortisol levels normal .
 How about your follicle- stimulating hormone levels ?
 Sheldon , I am not going through menopause .
 Are you sure ?
 You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy .
 I think we need to face the cold , hard truth :
 I was sexually aroused by Penny 's friend Zack .
 Hang on .
 I don 't know that we 've given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake .
 Let 's look at this logically . I have a stomach ; I get hungry . I have genitals ; I have the potential for sexual arousal .
 A cross we all must bear .
 You know , in difficult moments like this ,
 I often turn to a force greater than myself .
 Religion ? Star Trek . Did you see

 No .
 Don 't .
 It 's terrible .
 However ... in it , we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half , he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar .
 Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction ?
 " Cheap science fiction " ? What are you doing ?
 Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment .
 Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy ?
 I hadn 't considered that . Give me a moment .
 All right , I 've considered it . And ?
 I reject it .
 You reject it because you don 't feel jealousy , or because you are suppressing jealousy ?
 I think I 'll eat my lunch at home .
 That 's not your lunch , Sheldon ; those are the cadaver brain specimens .
 Oh .
 As they were incorrectly sliced , you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi .
 Hello .
 Hey .
 Isn 't tomorrow your usual laundry night ?
 The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener .
 If this one under - or over- softens ,
 I 'll need time to make things right .
 That 's thinking ahead . The alternative would be to think backwards .
 That 's just remembering .
 So how 's Amy ?
 Amy 's changed . I might have to let her go .
 Oh , no . Why ?
 I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect , like me .
 But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges .
 Like you . Just going to skip over that insult .
 What insult ? Yeah .
 That 's why I 'm going to skip over it .
 Are you saying that Amy is ... oh , what 's the scientific word ...
 Forget science .
 She 's horny .
 Oh ! Okay . Wow .
 It 's simple biology .
 There 's nothing I can do about it .
 Are you sure ?
 What are you suggesting ?
 I 'm suggesting there might be something you could do about ... Amy 's urges ?

 It 's illegal to spay a human being . Yeah .
 That 's not what I had in mind .
 Oh . Oh !
 You mean ... something could do . Exactly .
 Well , I was hoping to avoid this .
 But I might as well get it over with .
 Thank you , Penny .
 I 'll let you know what happens .
 Oh , Amy , you lucky girl .
 Yes .
 This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper .
 Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbor Penny ?
 Sorry to bother you .
 Hello .
 I 'm looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbor Penny .
 Coitus .
 It means intercourse .
 And I have a feeling I 'm speaking to the right Zack . This is Sheldon Cooper . Fine .
 Shelly .
 Yes , that does sound like a girl 's name .
 No , it doesn 't bother me . Yes , " Smelly Shelly " does bother me .
 Let me tell you why I 'm calling .
 I 'd like to know if you 'd be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler .
 Amy Farrah Fowler .
 Yes , that a girl 's name .
 Good grief . It 's like trying to talk to a dolphin .
 Really ?
 This is going to decide who 's the hero and who 's the sidekick ?


 You got a better idea ?
 Every idea is better than this idea .
 Ding !
 Wait .
 What the hell is " ding " ?
 It 's a bell .
 I don 't think this kind of wrestling has a bell . Fine . How do you want to start ?
 I say , uh , how about one , two , three , go ?
 One- two- three- go ? That 's for babies .
 Okay , how about , uh ...
 On your mark , get set , go ? That 's for a footrace .
 If you want to race , we have to go outside .
 No , it 's chilly outside .
 Didn 't bring my jacket .
 Oh , for crying out loud .
 What kind of superhero needs a jacket ?
 What kind of superhero says , " Dibs on the red tights ! Dibs on the red tights ! "
 All right , how about this ? Ready , wrestle . Wait .
 Are we starting now ?
 Or is that what you 're going to say when we do start , or ... We 're starting now ! Don 't yell at me !


 Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night .
 None come to mind .
 Look at this stamp .
 On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter ?
 I 'm sure it 'll wash off . Little comfort tonight .
 I look like a Hell 's Angel . There 's Zack .
 Are you sure this is what you want to do ?
 It 's not what I want to do ; it 's what I have to do .
 Go , Amy Farrah Fowler . Follow your endocrine system .
 Thank you , Sheldon .
 You 're a good friend .
 Please don 't drag this out .
 This is never going to come off .
 Excuse me ?
 Zack , I am Amy Farrah Fowler .
 We met the other night .
 I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge .
 Until I met you , my decisions were founded in logic and reason .
 And yet here I stand before you , 130 pounds of raging estrogen ,
 longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare 's metaphorical beast with two backs .
 My gluteus what ?
 On the other hand , as I look at the blank , ape- like expression on your face ,
 I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar .
 Good- bye , Zack . Bye . Hoo .

 That should hold me for a while .



 I 'm legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11 .
 I 'd be a regular ninja by now if my mom could 've arranged a carpool . Oh , yeah ?
 Well , I 've been taking Pilates class at the rec center , and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar . Oh , yeah ? Won 't matter , you 're going down !
 No , uh- uh , you 're going down !
 If anybody 's going to go down , it 's going to be you .
 Fellas . It 's been 30 minutes .
 Nobody 's touched each other .
 I 'm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect .
 As am I.
 What are you doing ? An experiment .
 Nope . Nothing .
 Never mind .



 You realize you can 't win .
 I prefer to think that I can 't lose .
 You 're wrong .
 It 's only a matter of time before you fall into Rat- Man 's rat trap .
 You pathetic fool !
 If there were a rat- catcher , wouldn 't it catch Rat- Man ?
 Just because I didn 't express myself well doesn 't mean my underlying point was invalid !
 You bloviating buffoon !
 You narcissistic nincompoop !
 You crimson coward !
 Oh , Leonard , wake up , you 're missing some very excellent superhero quips .
