 I didn 't charge you for the fries , 'cause I ate them .
 [ drone propellers whirring ]
 [ gasps ]
 Max , look out !
 The diner water bugs are getting really big .
 Relax , it 's the diner 's new surveillance drone .
 God , you empty the register five or ten times , suddenly there 's no trust .
 So to be clear , we 're out of soap but we have a drone ?
 I hate that Han 's just sitting in back , watching us , working his little joy stick .
 Please , no one 's getting any joy out of Han 's little stick .
 This is so annoying .
 It 's following me .
 Well , with a butt that flat , it 's the only black thing that 's ever going to follow you .
 Ugh , there 's another drone out here ?
 I just killed one in the kitchen with a fly swatter .
 Go .
 I mean , if I wanted to be spied on ,
 I 'd change my name to Achmed , and buy a condo near the airport .
 Whatever happened to buying a painting of an old sea captain , drilling out the eye holes , and hiding behind it ?
 Not cool , Han .
 And the worst part is , it 's moving around so much ,
 I can 't find my good angle .
 Not cool and not Han .
 I stole this while he was explaining to me why a 77- year- old man , on minimum wage , doesn 't need health care .
 Earl , that is awesome .
 Not really .
 I need that health care .
 No , that you stole that .
 We need to do something that will make Han never want to spy on us again .
 Oleg , open your pants .
 Earl , fly that camera in there .
 But first , take off your underwear .
 Underwear ?
 Come on .
 What am I , five ?
 Inches ?
 Oleg , aren 't you at all worried about Earl 's cataracts ?
 Best case scenario , I get a little manscaping .
 Worst case , I 've been meaning to get circumcised .

 Max , I 'm writing out the check for our bank loan , and I 'm not quite sure what our balance is because here under " withdrawal " you just wrote , " yeah " .
 Well , if you don 't like that , you 're really not going to like the picture I drew under " deposits . "
 I saw it .
 Max , zeroes are not balls , they 're not boobs , and they 're not googly eyes .
 They 're just zeroes .
 Says you .
 I 'll go check our balance at the ATM .
 Even though the last guy who touched it had a cold sore so big ,
 I charged him for a party of two .
 You are not going to get anything from that machine . Don 't worry .


 Especially cash .
 Hey , everybody .
 Oh , yeah .
 Somebody better make me some eggs because I 've been on a juice cleanse for three hours , and I 'm dizzy .
 I mean , they call it a fast , but it sure does go slow . Yeah .


 I was on a three weeks fast , once .
 Then I realized my mother wasn 't coming home .
 So I made a sandwich .
 Oleg and my wedding is coming up and we 're trying to eat clean .
 Yeah , baby , 'cause you know we 're eating dirty on the honeymoon .
 [ screaming ]
 Oh , dear God , what ?
 Another used condom in the receipt slot ?
 - Worse .
 - What ?
 Stuff that should be in a condom but isn 't ?
 We 're below zero .
 Oh , well , I better go , y 'all .
 A white woman screaming anywhere in my vicinity never turns out well .
 This is a disaster .
 I 've been at zero , but I 've never had less than zero .
 Oh , don 't say that , Caroline .
 I mean , you 're forgetting about your dating options .
 We have less than zero money and no way of paying off our bank loan .
 Oh , my God .
 It happened .
 I 'm working class .
 Hey .
 I 've waited tables with you for four years and there 's no way you could call what you do working .
 Cupcakes !
 Buy cupcakes .
 Buy cupcakes !
 Stop .
 You look more desperate than Justin Bieber in that Calvin Klein ad .
 You don 't understand the seriousness of this bank situation .
 You don 't understand the rules of
 The loan just keeps escalating and escalating until they close us down .
 Cupcakes !
 Buy cupcakes !
 Buy cupcakes !
 Buy cupcakes !
 Oh , Pay- dirt .
 Look .
 Here comes a big , fat frat house guy .
 Hey , bitches .
 Remember me ?
 Big Mary .
 That 's my name .
 Don 't wear it out .
 John , we haven 't seen you since pastry school .
 Hey , for old times ' sake , want to buy a cupcake ?
 A dozen ?
 The shop ?
 So I came because I may know of a way for Max to make some extra money .
 Whatever it is , she 'll do it .
 That was my yearbook quote .
 I just got hired at a new restaurant that 's opening under the High Line Park in Manhattan , and they are looking for another day pastry chef .

 I only have a year of pastry school and I was stoned for , like , a year of that .
 I don 't know if I have the skills .
 [ chuckles ] Oh , girl , you don 't .
 But the manager , Joe , wants only pretty people .
 And what you lack in pastry , you more than make up for in pretty .
 She 'll do it .
 You 'll do it , Max .
 And John will be there to help back you up with his pastry skills .
 And 'cause I 'm pretty .
 I don 't belong in a place like that .
 It 's called " The High . "
 Sounds right .
 Give me the deets .
 Well , good night girls .
 Sorry about your bank balance .
 But I trust you 'll both lapse into denial fairly soon , as always .
 Hello .
 Who was she ?
 Hold me closer , tiny dancer .
 Oh ...
 Han 's not gay .
 You forgot the " yet . "
 Max , maybe button up a button or two .
 It 's a dessert bar .
 Not a strip bar .
 Hey , I need this job , and once this Joe guy takes one look at these puff pastries , he might cut me some slack when he sees my other " not so puff " pastries .

 And you 're comfortable with that ?
 Yup .
 Like I guess you 're comfortable applying for a waitress job on just the merits of your waitress skills .
 Should I keep going ?
 Why ?
 I 'm here .
 I 'll take those applications .
 Hurry , ladies .
 If I was looking for pretty and slow , I 'd hire Nick Jonas .
 Max , let 's get out of here .
 She reminds me of this nightmare
 I 'm going to have for the rest of my life .
 Relax , she 's just his guard dog .
 It 's Joe guy we have to impress .
 No thank you .
 No thank you .
 And how dare you ?
 Oh , I 'm sorry , the restaurant doesn 't open until tomorrow .
 Actually , no .
 Hi .
 I 'm here to apply for a waitress job .
 At your age ?
 I 'm 27 !
 And ?
 Max , I can 't breathe .
 And I 'm here to apply for a pastry chef .
 Also 27 , but I 've looked this old since I was 6 .
 For a while , I thought I had that Benjamin Button 's disease .
 I 'll take the pastry chef first .
 Why don 't you sit over there and wait .
 I won 't be long , because frankly , you don 't have the time .
 Thank you .
 I 'll be over there .
 Applying for Social Security .
 So where did you go to pastry school , and why aren 't you working now ?
 Manhattan School Of Pastry , and I am working .
 I have my own cupcake shop in Brooklyn .
 Oh , it 's almost over .
 This interview ?
 Great . No .
 Not the interview .
 Brooklyn .
 Brooklyn 's almost over .
 Also , cupcakes .
 Cool .
 I will tell them .
 Wish I knew that before they all got their belly buttons pierced trying to stay cool .
 Oh , great .
 A sense of humor .
 Customers love that .
 I don 't , but they do .
 So , um , where 's this Joe guy who 's doing the hiring ?
 There is no " Joe guy " .
 I 'm Joe . Spelled , J- O- E- D- T- H.
 The D- T- H is silent .
 As am I , because I want this job .
 Well , I guess I can put these away then .
 That was your plan ?
 To expose your breasts and seduce your way into this job ?
 You say that like it 's a bad thing .
 Okay .
 Well , bye .
 Sit , sit .
 If you really can bake , this position might be perfect for you .
 Also , you have that edgy ,
 " I don 't give a crap " attitude .
 Customers love that .
 I don 't , but they do .
 Actually , Joe , silent D- T- H , I can bake .
 But how well ?
 My girlfriend and I are obsessed with French pastry .
 Oh .
 Girlfriend as in " girlfriend , " or as in two ladies of a certain age at a Cineplex splitting one thing of popcorn ?
 Everything you just said offended me .
 Yeah , that 's my brand .
 And the fact that you didn 't cry about splitting a popcorn makes me think it 's the first kind of girlfriend .
 How are your macaroons ?
 Uh ... oh .
 Mm .
 My macaroons ?
 Great .
 A little bit of French heaven .
 What is your name ?
 Max .
 M- a- x .
 [ clicks teeth ] Nothing is silent .
 Ever .
 So I gather .
 Okay .
 Why don 't you go fill out an application , Max .
 And you can put those away again .
 I 'm really not into big- breasted women .
 Girl , you got this .
 First day .
 Are you nervous , girl ?
 Nervous is telling your elderly Mormon parents that you 're gay after your three older siblings already came out . Please .



 I have no idea what most of these desserts are .
 I haven 't felt this lost since the finale of
 Max , can you see any of the Barney 's price tags on these ?
 Uh , I think there 's one bunching up inside the back of your pants .
 No , that 's the underwear I 'm also returning .
 Here she comes .
 Hi , ladies .
 This is Naomi , the dessert bar hostess .
 Go , Naomi , go .
 Gorgeous , but as dumb as whoever is the hot new idiot right now .
 Let me take a look at you .
 Good- bye .
 Already ?
 Those pearls .
 They have to go .
 Really ?
 It 's just , well ,
 I 'm kind of emotionally attached to them .
 Well , honey , I love my half- blind French bulldog , but I don 't wear her around my neck .
 Max , let me take a look .
 Love it .
 Fabulous .
 Well done .
 Hi , Joe .
 Big day .
 I 'm so excited .
 Why don 't you be excited in the back , doll ?
 I want Max up front now .
 All my life , people have been telling me not to come out .
 Why should here be any different ?
 Ladies , I just got word that the food critic may make a surprise visit this afternoon .
 Everything has to be perfect ... the service , the desserts , the precarious balance of my meds .
 Nothing can go wrong .
 Naomi .
 Fetch .
 " Welcome to The High " .
 " Hi .
 Welcome to The High " .
 " Welcome to The High " .
 Stop saying high .
 It reminds me I 'm not .
 Wait , Max , you 're not high ?
 Like , not high at all ?
 No .
 I didn 't want to screw today up .
 What the hell is wrong with you ?
 You can 't change who you are today .
 The is coming .
 How will you cope ?
 I mean , when 's the last time you weren 't high ?
 My birth .
 But I was really drunk .
 I had just had a bottle of wine .
 Well , my mother had .
 I have to go wait on those customers .
 Do what you can to get with the program .
 I mean , get off the program .
 You can 't bake not baked .
 Big Mary ?
 John ?
 Why not try my new name ?
 Quasimodo .
 Do you have any weed ?
 Do I have any weed ?
 Let me check my hump .
 Nope .
 No weed .
 Thanks , Rico .
 I didn 't want to ask due to the city- wide ban on racial profiling .
 This dish room is cleaner than Chris Christie 's plate after lunch . Wow .


 Max , I need two lavender macaroons .
 - Where are they ?
 - I 'm working on them .
 Well , good .
 I 'm so proud of you .
 This is so
 Here are the lavender macaroons .
 See ?
 Even just holding this , I 'm better .
 Now we just have to hope nothing goes wrong .
 ( Sophie ) Surprise !
 We all came to support you .
 ( Caroline ) Well , that 's it .
 The food critic may be in the same room as Han , Earl , Oleg , and Sophie .
 We 're dead .
 Time of death , 11 : 30 .
 I believe it 's more like 4 : 20 .
 Oh , Caroline , I love your new place .
 It 's so fresh and pretty .
 It kind of looks like a douche commercial .
 You 're right , baby .
 It looks exactly like a douche commercial .
 Okay .
 Can we stop saying " douche " in the fancy pastry shop ?
 I agree .
 Not appropriate .
 Caroline , darling , slip my phone number to that fine Nubian princess .
 And tell her not to be fooled by my bad hip .
 I can still gently rock her world .
 Okay , guys , what are you doing here and how quickly can you leave ?
 Real nice .
 After we came all this way to just order only desserts that Max knows how to make and to say nice things about you as a waitress .
 Oh , you 'd do that for me ?
 Hell no , I can 't pull that off .
 If I could act , I 'd sell the restaurant and get cast in two- line roles as the doctor on any network television show .
 Sophie 's the actress .
 And trust me , she 's got quite a repertoire .
 In bed , I call her Meryl Sheets .
 Do it , baby .
 [ Southern Belle accent ] Oh , what a lovely place .
 That 's the accent she uses when we play
 " 12 Years A Sex Slave . "
 Lovely , be right back .
 Oh , and , welcome to The High .
 ( Joedth ) What 's going on with that table ?
 Is there a European circus in town ?
 A circus ?
 Well , I wouldn 't know .
 I really have no idea who they are .
 That didn 't require an answer .
 It was just one of my dead- on observations .
 Just get rid of them .
 Tell them we 've run out of funnel cakes .
 Well , I 'm feeling like my old self .
 Joe just told me to lose Han , Earl , Oleg , and Sophie .
 How am I supposed to lose that many people ?
 I 'm not air traffic control .
 You are acting like they don 't know how to act in a fancy place .
 [ Sophie , yelling ]
 Girls , look !
 Oleg 's wearing his napkin as a party hat .
 [ Sophie laughing ]
 Here 's your dessert .
 Bon appetite .
 Max , I can 't believe you just made that .
 Neither can I.
 And what did you say to Oleg and Sophie ?
 It 's been an hour , and I haven 't seen any over- the- table penetration .
 I just told them to be on their best behavior , and they 're fine with it .
 Excuse me , Max .
 Yes , hi .
 May I go tinkle ?
 Or is that against the law here at Guantanamo Dessert Bay ?
 I 'm gonna go have sex in the ladies room .
 Unless you two prudes have a problem with that , too .
 Excuse me .
 Can I get a latte and a red wine ?
 [ clears throat ]
 ' Cause I got a Vicodin stuck in my throat .
 Oh , my God .
 Who could be that messed up in the middle of the afternoon ?
 Uh , my new best friend .
 I better get rid of her before Joe or that critic walks in .
 You keep doing good things by accident .
 Hi , can I get a ...
 You sure can .
 Anywhere but here .
 ( woman ) Oh , no .
 Spinning 's not good for me right now .
 ( Joedth ) What is she doing here ?
 Leaving .
 You never saw her .
 - Wait ...
 - Joe , I got this .
 My bestie at school was totally hooked on prescription pills for , like , a week .
 Hey , hi , you .
 Excuse me .
 Where is Max ?
 She 's in the back for a sec .
 So ...
 We meet again .
 Sir , do you need something in the back ?
 Yes , Caroline said she 'd bring me a napkin , but I could get Time Warner on the phone faster than that .
 Just ask Max .
 She covers for Caroline all the time at the diner .
 Max ?
 Ooh .
 Drama at The High .
 Han , that 's my new boss .
 Stop talking .
 Also , stop collecting stickers .
 You 're a grown- up .
 Okay , I threw that drug addict out .
 That drug addict is my girlfriend .
 More drama at The High .
 And Caroline , we have a problem .
 You called Allie a drug addict .
 Oh , is that her name ?
 Allie ?
 So cute .
 Even lovelier .
 And according to that very small man , you 're also a terrible waitress .
 But I had no idea you two were together .
 I would have thought a powerful ...
 Stop .
 Now .
 Joe , look , we really need these jobs .
 We made a bad decision with our bakery business , and we have a big bank loan that we can 't pay .
 Honesty .
 Good .
 People respond to honesty .
 I don 't , but they do .
 Max , you have potential here .
 Caroline , you 're fired as a waitress .
 Are you sure ?
 Stop !
 There 's nothing in there to save you .
 Well , if she 's fired , I 'm fired , too .
 Oh , relax , Norma Rae .
 She 's fired as a waitress , but she 's hired as a hostess .
 I am ?
 Why ?
 Because you 're pretty , you flashed a boob , and you took more control of Allie in five minutes than anybody 's been able to do in her three rehab stints .
 And that , lady , is a New York City hostess .
 Well , girls , I struck out .
 Bill Cosby has ruined it for all black men over 70 who are just trying to buy a gal a drink .
 Max , how do you like that ?
 I 'm the hostess .
 I got a promotion !
 I don 't think a hostess is a promo ...
 It is , Max , 'cause with a less- than- zero bank balance , it has to be .
 It 's all I have left .
