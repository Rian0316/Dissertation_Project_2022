 [ in English ] What the fuck ?

 What the fuck ?
 I ... I 'm sorry .
 My boyfriend referred to my vagina as a " lady flower . "
 Dump him immediately .
 [ song continues playing ]

 Ah , merci .
 [ Emily ] We are at Beaumont- Hamel , a preserved battlefield of the Somme .
 British troops suffered over 19, 000 fatalities here on their first day , making it one of the bloodiest days in British Army history .
 Mr. Hendricks .
 Thank you , Miss Sands . Now , some rules .
 [ in high- pitched voice ] " Rules ? But you 're the fun one . "
 [ in normal voice ] I know , Ruby , I am , but from now on , no more Mr. Nice Guy .
 Okay , so Miss Sands will now divide you into groups .
 Did you hear about Ruby ?
 I know . Can you imagine getting dumped by Otis Milburn ?
 [ Colin ] During that time , I want your full uniforms on .
 The entire time .
 I don 't wanna see any loose ties . We 're representing the school today , guys .
 - So that means no drama . - Otis , these guys .
 - No , miss , he can 't be in our group . - He 's a twat .
 It 's fine , miss .
 It 's the least I could do . After all , I did break his heart .
 Oh , that would make a lot more sense , actually .
 Uh , miss , will I get to hold a gun ?
 [ Emily ] No . You 've already asked .
 You won 't get to hold a bomb either .
 [ Eric humming ]
 Eric , no .
 - You cannot wear that . - Why not ? It 's just my tracksuit .
 You don 't want to draw attention to yourself in Nigeria .
 It 's dangerous for you . It 's not like here .
 What do you mean for me , Mum ?
 You know what I mean .
 Go and change now .
 Come on ! I want everyone packed in the next half an hour !
 [ emotional music playing ]
 [ Steve ] I wish I was in your group . I don 't know those guys .
 You 'll be okay . And it 's good to make new friends .
 Now , off you go , you silly sausage .
 I know this is bad , but Steve is making me feel so arachnophobic .
 Do you mean claustrophobic ?
 Arachnophobic means you 're scared of spiders .
 Oh ! No , I love spiders .
 - I love their hairy legs . - [ chuckles ]
 - How many people died here , do you think ? - [ phone chimes ]
 A lot .
 - [ Aimee ] What were they fighting over ?
 - [ Maeve ] That 's a good question . How 's your new best pal , Hope ?

 - She 's just checking in .
 - She 's just using you .
 Well , I 'm using her too . That 's how you get ahead in life .
 - Okay . If you 're cool with that . - I am .
 - [ Cal ] It . Marchetti !
 - [ Jackson ]
 Oh !
 - Your country needs you .
 - [ laughs ]
 - Hey , Viv . - [ Viv ] Hey , Cal .
 Come to the student forum and talk about the uniform thing .
 - You clearly feel strongly about it .
 - Oh , thank you , but no thank you .
 Other students would benefit from the issue being raised .
 Well , then they can raise it .
 Race you to the top . Three , two , one , go !
 - [ phone chimes ]
 - [ scoffs ]


 Ruby , can we talk ?
 Don 't look at her . Don 't speak to her . Don 't breathe .
 - I 'm trying to apologize . - Stop talking . It 's triggering for Ruby .
 [ soulful song playing ]

 [ Jean ] Jakob , I 'll wait for you in the car .
 Yeah , yeah , coming .
 [ song ends ]
 Hi , I 'm Hope Haddon . I 'm here to see Dr. O 'Dern .
 Jean Milburn .
 Yes .
 I 'm Hope .
 - New head teacher at Moordale . - Yes . I know who you are .
 You must be exhausted .
 New hit book and a baby on the way .
 Yes , it is a bit full- on at the minute , but I like to keep busy .
 How are you enjoying the transition to Moordale ?
 A lot of things needed addressing , as I 'm sure you 're aware .
 You deal with some of it in your book .
 Oh , you 've read it .
 I skimmed .
 It 's an interesting take , but we have different perspectives when it comes to teaching children .
 Yes . I 've seen your new SRE curriculum .
 It looks a lot like you 're advocating abstinence to me .
 It isn 't so much about abstinence as it is about restraint , which I think is an important attribute , particularly for teenagers who should be focusing on their education .
 Unfortunately , restraint doesn 't mix very well with raging hormones .
 I think that 's giving teenagers less credit than they 're due .
 Sorry . I gave you the wrong form .
 This one 's for the older mummies .
 - It was lovely to meet you . - Yes .
 [ Jean ] If you 're open to discussing this further ,
 I 'd be very interested in telling you more about my perspective .
 [ chuckles ] Okay . I 'll see if I can find some time .
 [ chuckles ] Fantastic .
 [ Steve ] A bit awkward , isn 't it ?
 I 'm currently with your ex- girlfriend , and , you know , you stole Rahim 's boyfriend .
 That 's what I mean by awkward , you know ?
 I thought if I said it out loud , it 'd make it less tense , but it didn 't .
 I dated Aimee as well .
 Should we check out these trenches ?
 I , uh , I didn 't steal your boyfriend .
 That 's exactly what you did .
 - [ Kyle ] I really liked Aimee , you know ? - [ Steve ]
 Oh yeah ?
 She was really nice . And a total fuck machine .
 - You 're a lucky guy . - That 's so inappropriate .
 - Shrooms ? - No , thanks .
 [ Jackson ] Why did you say no to Viv about the uniform thing ?
 What 's the point ? Not like it would change anything .
 - Well , you could try . Maybe Hope might ...
 - Dude .
 Let 's just have fun . Okay ?
 - Yeah ? - Yeah .
 Mushrooms , anybody ?
 - Oh .
 Ooh !
 - Oh .
 What do you reckon ?
 - Okay . - [ Steve ]
 Hey , guys ! I found a bunker .
 [ Viv ] What would you like me to bring up at the student forum ?
 Well , I think we should have free pads and tampons at school .
 Mm- hmm .
 See , that is a great idea .
 Could you take a picture of me with this guy ?
 Yeah , sure .
 [ phone chimes ]
 Who 's Eugene , and what does he wanna do with your sweet crevice ?
 He 's my boyfriend , and , um , we 've been sexting .
 Apparently , his fantasy is medieval maidens .
 - Hm . - And he calls his dick a sheath .
 Yes , and my vagina a lady flower . Gives me the ick .
 But you like fantasy stuff .
 I love me some Dungeons and Dragons when it 's a game , not when I 'm DTF .
 Maybe you should try and get into it . You might be surprised .
 Ola didn 't know about alien role- play . Now she fucking loves it .
 Okay . Well , I guess I can try .
 I 'll help you . I 'm basically an erotica genius .
 " Men slept 12 to a bunker in four- hour shifts . "

 " So that meant getting a good meal meant you might be killed the next day . "
 It says , " During World War I , 250, 000 boys under 18 were recruited . "
 Same age as us .
 Crazy to think people used to have to go to war .
 Some still do . We 're just lucky .
 [ recorded voice speaking French ]
 What are we supposed to be looking at ? It 's basically a fucking junkyard .
 Why couldn 't we have gone to the Eiffel Tower ?
 Better for selfies .
 I think we 're supposed to imagine what it was like here back then .
 - [ Otis ] Did you hear something , Olivia ? - Must have been the wind or a war ghost .
 - What are you looking at ? - Yeah . Stop it .
 She hates you .
 Thank you for the support , but I can deal with this by myself .
 [ Ruby ]
 Hm ?
 I do feel awful , Ruby .
 I didn 't want to hurt you , and I feel worse thinking that you hate me .
 I don 't hate you , Otis .
 It 'd be so much easier if I did .
 I just can 't be around you at the moment , okay ?
 I ...
 I get it . I 'm glad you don 't hate me .
 All right . Come on , let 's go . [ whistles ] [ in French ]
 Come on ! [ in English ]
 Is that it ? We 've only been here half an hour .
 France is so shit .
 [ Aimee ] What 's a conscientious objector ?
 It was when men refused to go to war because it went against their beliefs .
 Wow .
 I wanna stand up for what I believe in more .
 - Like you in SRE the other day . - [ Maeve chuckles ]
 I 'd never be brave enough to do something like that .
 You could definitely do that , Aimee .
 [ clears throat ] I , um , hooked up with Isaac the other day .
 - What ? Get in ! - [ chuckles ]
 - What was it like ? - It was good .
 Yeah . We just get each other .
 Think I 'm gonna give it a proper go with him .
 You do know Otis and Ruby broke up .
 Yeah , I heard .
 What about it ?
 - Oh , I just thought maybe ... - Maybe what ?
 Well , I ...
 - I thought you guys might ... - I said I wanna give it a go with Isaac .
 What Otis does isn 't my business anymore .
 Okay . Cool .
 I 'm so happy for you .
 - Thanks , mate . - [ phone chimes ]

 - Oh , fuck off , Anna . - What 's going on with Anna ?
 She paid for this trip without asking . It 's pissed me off .
 She didn 't pay for it . I did .
 What do you mean ?
 You said you couldn 't afford it , so I asked my mum to pay .
 - I knew you wouldn 't take the money .
 - Why did you do that ?
 It 's no big deal . I wanted you to come .
 You don 't have to pay me back . Money doesn 't matter to me .
 It does to me .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 We should get on the coach .
 " I want to remove your codpiece and release your beautiful sheath , then let you make love to me in a glen full of bluebells where you will water my hidden peach with your prince 's tongue . "
 No , I 'm not gonna send that . It 's just not me .
 Thank you though .
 You keep thinking about the student forum .
 Some people have no imaginations , I guess .
 Lil , I wouldn 't mind if we had sex without the alien stuff sometimes .
 I 've been meaning to say something . I didn 't know how to .
 Why ?
 I didn 't wanna make you feel weird .
 No . Why don 't you wanna do the alien stuff ? I thought you liked it .
 I do sometimes . Sometimes it 's a little bit strange .
 - I 'm gonna get on the bus . - [ Colin ] Let 's go !
 - Aw , Lil ! - [ Colin in French ] Let 's go !
 [ in English ] We 're off to another cemetery , and I am pumped .
 I mean , I 'm moderately excited , and I will be monitoring your behavior .
 Shit , we 're running 15 minutes late !
 - Are we ? - Yeah .
 Terry , I will give you 20 euros if you can get us back on schedule .
 - Done . - Great .
 Come on , Quentin , for fuck 's sake ! What , do you wanna marry France ?
 Jesus !
 [ Colin ] Terry !

 You wanna get Kyle to swap seats ? He can sit with Steve .
 No , thanks . I 'm fine .
 They were too young to die , Maeve .
 Some of them were our age .
 Mm- hmm .

 [ PA announcement chime ] [ doctor ] Okay , Hope .
 So , seeing as it 's only been six weeks since your last round of IVF treatment ,
 I 'm going to advise waiting a little longer before trying again .
 I 'd rather not wait too long .
 Have you thought about other options , such as adoption ?
 I 've been asked this before .
 I 've thought about it , and I am not ready to stop trying to have my own child yet .
 Can I ask about how this is affecting your relationship with your husband ?
 - Infertility treatments can cause strain ... - We 're fine .
 He couldn 't make it today because of work .
 When can I book another round ?
 I 'm not prepared to offer you another round yet .
 I 'll have to talk to another doctor , then .
 You can see Dr. Ennis when he 's back from holiday next week , but I think he 'll tell you the same thing .
 I want a second opinion .

 Everything looks normal .
 You don 't wanna know the sex . Have you changed your mind ?
 No , thanks .
 I 'd rather wait .
 [ doctor ] Many older mothers make that choice .
 They want to focus on getting through the pregnancy safely .
 Now , you are aware there 's a higher chance of miscarriage , genetic abnormalities , fetal growth ...
 Yes . I 've been reminded of the risks many times . Thank you .
 I didn 't go into this lightly .
 Yes . Modern science is allowing women like yourself to have babies older and older now .

 You don 't sound as if you approve .
 Well , it 's easy to forget that being an elderly parent can have a negative effect on your children 's lives .
 Do you have children , Doctor ?
 - Uh , yeah , two .
 - Hm .
 And do you think having a king- sized arsehole for a father had a negative impact on their lives too ?
 I want to talk to your superior .
 [ indistinct chattering ]
 Is it true you don 't wank anymore ?
 What are you talking about ?
 Everyone says that Eric broke your heart , so now you can 't wank anymore .
 Please stop speaking .
 If I don 't wank every day , my balls go blue .
 I don 't need to know that .
 Excuse me .

 You going for a wank ?
 No , I 'm not going for a wank .
 [ Ola ] I don 't know why you 're taking it personally .
 I 'm embarrassed .
 I 've been dressing up as an alien , and you 've been thinking it 's strange .
 Not strange .

 Is everyone okay ? What the hell happened ?
 Something hit that car .
 I think It was a bat ! I hope it 's not dead .
 [ Jean ] A doctor should not be putting his opinions about my pregnancy on me .
 - It 's completely inappropriate . -
 It 's patriarchy in action , in fact .
 Dissecting a woman 's choices in the cruelest manner .
 - And in a hospital ! - Hey , what 's happening ?
 I just had the most horrible experience with a doctor , and I am making a formal complaint .
 Sorry . We are upset .
 No , we are not upset .

 And my anger is appropriate .
 - Can you help us ? Thank you . - Let me call my supervisor .

 - It 's not you , Jackson . - I poo all the time .
 - [ Colin ] Someone own up , please . - I 'm just a tube .

 - I blocked the toilet . I was embarrassed ... - I also poo sometimes .
 Oh God , don 't we all ?
 What is this , Spartacus ?
 Maybe it was my poo . Maybe it 's Miss Sands ' poo .
 - [ boy ] What ? - She 's more than capable .
 We don 't have time for that now .
 Adam , clean this up . I don 't care how .
 Okay ?
 Thank you , Adam Groff , for owning up to doing this huge poo and undermining my authority .
 Thank you . Cheers , buddy .

 I can 't decide to be a baker just 'cause I like toast .
 [ tearfully ] That 's a fucking mean thing to say .
 Yeah , well , sorry , but it 's true .
 I wanted to do something nice . That 's all .
 You never accept help from anyone , ever , ' cause you 're too proud .
 I wanted to do a nice thing .
 - I don 't need nice things . - Because you 're above it all and strong ?
 You act like you don 't give a shit about anyone .
 It 's to keep people out .
 You 've done it to Otis , and you 're doing it to me !
 - I don 't keep everyone out . - You do .
 No , I don 't .
 You 're probably gonna do the same to Isaac and end up hurting everyone .
 You 're one to talk . Look how you treat Steve .
 You act like he 's got the plague every time he 's around you .
 He 's so confused because you 're too much of a people pleaser to break up with him !
 You talked about being brave .
 That would be brave .
 I 'll pay you back somehow .
 I don 't wanna talk about this anymore .
 - [ sobs ]
 - [ car engine starting ]
 [ Ola ] Have you replied to Eugene ?
 No . It 's ... it 's too awkward . I think I 'm just gonna break up with him .
 My mum always used to say ,
 " If you love someone , it 's better to bend a bit than break . "
 That 's if you really like them , obviously .
 It must be hard not having her around . She sounds really smart .
 Yeah , she was .
 It 's a little bit confusing at the moment because my dad 's having a new baby , and Lilly doesn 't really seem to understand why it 's difficult .
 My aunt died last year , and I thought the sadness would pass , but it never really goes away , only gets smaller .
 Maybe Lily 's never experienced that .
 Why don 't you try telling Eugene what you 'd like him to sext you instead ? [ Colin ]
 Let 's go ! What 's that ?
 - Really ? - It might work .

 - No . I left all my stuff on the coach .

 Okay . It just got a lot worse .
 - [ whimsical music playing ] - [ Otis whimpers ]
 Jean , haven 't seen you for a while .
 [ splutters ] Why 'd you stop calling me ?
 Holy fucking shit ! Wow !
 [ splutters ] That 's ... You 're ...
 I didn 't think you could ... that , like , older women could ...
 - Just say congratulations , Dan . - Congratulations ! Congratulations .
 Shit . It 's not mine , is it ?
 No , it 's mine , actually .
 [ chuckles ] Oh , that 's great , dude . That 's great .
 Well done .
 Phew !
 We need to go , actually . Goodbye .
 Right , yeah . No , I 've gotta go see the doctor myself .
 I 've got a weird chafing thing going on with my ball sack .
 I think it 's my motorbike , but it 's really ...

 [ Jakob sighs ]
 You used to sleep with this man ?
 He 's so much younger than you .
 I used to sleep with a lot of men . And some of them were younger than me .
 This makes me think .
 What does it make you think ?
 Is the baby even mine ?
 - What ? - He seemed to think it was his .
 - Don 't be ridiculous . He ... - Well , he did .
 I found this at home .
 What ?
 [ scoffs ]
 That could be anyone 's .
 It 's probably Remy 's from years ago .
 Why didn 't you talk to me about it ?
 Because you 're pregnant , and I didn 't wanna cause any stress .
 But then I see this motorcycle man , and you seem to have contacted him quite recently .
 And then I remember you 've been kissing your ex- husband and ...
 - Jakob ! - It just makes me think , okay ?
 Look , I have had a lot of casual sex in my life .
 I can 't change that . In fact , I wouldn 't want to .
 But if you don 't trust me , then this just isn 't going to work .
 [ exhales ]
 I don 't trust you .
 [ exhales ]
 I can 't believe this is happening .
 - How about a paternity test ?
 - [ scoffs ]
 Yeah . Yeah .
 Okay .
 If that 's what you want .
 [ sighs ]
 And what do we do in the meantime ?
 Are we still even together ?
 I don 't know .
 [ Colin ] Okay , party people .
 - [ " Pump Up the Jam " playing ] - This is for real .
 Who remembers this ? Anyone ? Here we go .
 Ready ?
 Whoa .
 Come on !
 No ?
 I 'm sorry I made you feel embarrassed .
 I don 't think the alien stuff is silly , but it 's not real .
 I 'd like to be a bit more grounded and in the moment with you .
 Aliens are definitely real .
 There are potentially endless galaxies and planets and universes out there , and you actually think we 're the only life that exists ?
 I think it 's better to focus on the life that we have on Earth .
 I can 't believe you don 't think aliens are real .
 I can 't believe you do .

 [ Otis ] It 's getting dark .
 It 's gonna be cold once it 's dark .
 I only got a B in French , so if we find someone to help , how do we know they 're actually a kind stranger and not some psychopath ?
 [ Otis breathing heavily ]
 What are we gonna eat ?
 I 'm hungry all the time !
 [ sighs ]
 I 'm panicking . Are you panicking ?
 No . We 're not gonna starve to death .
 I don 't think you 're taking this seriously enough .
 We could die .
 We 're not gonna die .
 Someone will drive past . We can use their phone .
 It 's gonna be fine .
 We should hitchhike or just walk to a nearby town .
 I think we should stay here .
 [ pants , whimpers ]
 Okay , this is bad .
 This is very bad .
 Okay . How ... how do you say " help " in French ?
 How do I say " help " ?
 [ chuckles ]
 [ Otis grunts ]
 [ in French ] Help !
 I am help !
 [ in English ] Why are you laughing ?
 - Sorry . You 're funny when you 're stressed .
 - Well , you 're not helping .
 [ Otis in French ] I am help !
 [ Maeve chuckles ]
 Something you wanna say ?
 I think poetry 's dumb .
 Why ?
 It 's just long words that don 't make any sense .
 Maybe you 're not listening .
 I have written a poem about you .
 [ Rahim clears throat ]
 " I shed blood over what ? "
 - You fell over ... Right . - " A rectangle man so unremarkable . "
 " A boring horse . "
 " Its blah- blah eyes never open , never closed . "
 " His head shape so average . "
 That 's actually quite good .
 I think I was wrong though .
 You 're not as unremarkable as I thought .
 [ whimsical music playing ]






 Hm .
 Mm- hmm .
 Even if you don 't do the forum , maybe you should still talk to Hope about the changing room thing .
 [ Jackson ]
 I don 't like Hope , but it 's important to you , so I think we should make her listen .
 What do you think ?
 [ inhales sharply ]
 - [ exhales sharply ] - Okay , well , I think ...

 You made me realize that I do .
 Okay .
 - We 'll make her listen .
 - Yes !

 You are beautiful .

 Um , I 'm sorry , Jackson . I don 't ... [ chuckles ]
 I don 't think I can do this .
 - Okay . No , that 's cool . - Sorry .


 Can you pass this to Maeve ?
 Babe , are you not attracted to me anymore ?
 I won 't be upset .
 Of course I 'll be upset . I just need to know if you wanna be with me .
 Course I wanna be with you .
 Maeve 's not here .
 Maeve ? Maeve ?
 Where 's Maeve ?
 She 's definitely not here .
 Maeve Wiley 's not on the coach .
 That can 't be right . I did a head count .
 Maeve ? - Maeve ? Maeve ?
 - Maeve !
 Maeve !
 [ man 2 ] Who is Maeve ?
 Who are you ?
 [ in German ] I 'm Albert .
 - [ in English ] Oh ... - Colin Ray Hendricks .
 Terry , turn the coach around !
 Maeve ?
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ yawning ]
 Why did you and Ruby break up ?
 Um ,
 I didn 't like her as much as she liked me .
 - It 's true . I know . - [ chuckles ]
 What about you ?
 How 's it going with that Isaac guy ?
 " That Isaac guy . "
 [ chuckles ] Yeah , things are good .
 I like him .
 [ Maeve ]
 Hm .
 I know you left me a voice mail .
 [ Otis chuckles ]
 Can we not , uh , talk about that ?
 It 's embarrassing enough you 've ignored me for months . [ chuckles nervously ]
 Or pretend it didn 't happen .
 I never got it .
 [ emotional music playing ]
 Isaac deleted it .
 What do you mean , " deleted " ?
 [ clears throat ] He was trying to protect me , apparently .
 He fucked up . It 's a whole thing .
 So you ... you never heard it ?
 Nope .
 [ Otis breathes deeply ]
 How long have you known ?
 I don 't know . Couple weeks .
 And you didn 't say anything ?
 No .
 You acted like a complete dick to me last term .
 You don 't get let off the hook ' cause you call up once and say I 'm sorry .
 That 's exactly how apologies work , Maeve .
 He shouldn 't have deleted it .
 No , he shouldn 't have .
 But he did , and here we are .
 [ Maeve sighs ]
 What did it say ?
 The voice mail ?
 Doesn 't matter .
 It was ages ago .
 Matters to me .
 It was something like ,
 " Hi , Maeve . "
 " I 'm watching you on TV right now . "
 " And I wanted to let you know how proud I am of you . "
 [ " The Breeze/ My Baby Cries " by Bill Callahan playing ]
 " And about how you saying you had feelings for me was all I ever wanted to hear . "
 " ' Cause it 's always been you . "
 " I love you . "
 Anyway , it was stupid .

 Did you mean it ?


 Did you mean it ?
 Of course I meant it .
 I can 't ...
 I can 't do this .
 [ Otis ] Okay .
 I understand .
 [ Otis moans ]
 I don 't ... I don 't wanna lose you again .
 [ both breathe heavily ]
 This is confusing me . I 'm confused .
 Ruby , don 't look .
 [ Colin ]
 Ah !
 Milburn . You 're here too . We had no idea you were missing .
 So sorry .
 Come on , guys , on the coach . On the coach !
 [ both sigh in relief ]
 - [ both chuckle ] - Oh my ...
 - [ students cheer ]
 - Woo- hoo !
 We 're the worst teachers .
 [ laughs ]
 - But we are good in a crisis . - Yeah .
 And we make the most incredible team .
 Don 't you think ?
 [ exhales ]
 What are you doing ?
 Emily Swati Sands ...
 Will you marry me ?
 Of course not . We 've been dating less than a year .
 But ...
 I have been thinking that maybe we could move in together .
 Really ?
 [ chuckles ] Yeah .
 But where will Michael live ?
 He 's a grown man . He 'll be fine .
 Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
 [ cheering ]
 Save your applause .
 We are not getting married , but we are moving in together !
 [ Colin ] Yes !
 [ laughs ]
 Can we please go home ?
 Uh , miss , I 'm ready for my presentation .
 Oh , we 're not doing that till we get back to school , Kyle .
 [ mic feedback ]
 All right , listen up , everyone . I 've had an epiphany on this trip .
 We 're all gonna die .
 - Kyle , sit down . - [ Kyle ] Life is so short .
 We might not be dead yet , like those poor , young soldiers , but one day we will be .
 So , my point is ...
 Where 'd he get that ? That 's a soldier 's hat . Stolen property !
 [ Kyle ]
 Oh .
 I 've forgotten what my point is , but how cool is my hat ?
 It 's not cool , Kyle .
 Oh yeah .
 Um ...
 My ... my point is that we should try and live in the moment because we don 't have long .
 So , if you love someone , you should tell 'em that you love 'em .
 Tell 'em now .
 Because it might be too late .
 Life is fragile .
 So , in the spirit of spreading the love ,
 I got a little gift for everyone .
 These are called magic mushrooms . - Whoa , whoa , whoa !
 - So ...
 [ Emily ] Kyle , sit down !
 Sit down , Kyle .
 You have to spoil it . You were doing so well , Kyle .
 Let 's just forget that happened , all right ?
 I know this trip has been hard for some of you .
 But we 're only half an hour away from the White Cliffs of Dover .
 So , let 's fix up , tidy up our uniforms , and get our general shit together .
 Yeah ?
 Cheers .
 Lights , please , Terry .
 [ " When I Live My Dream " by David Bowie playing ] [ phone chimes ]

 Fucking love you .
 Baba ghanoush . [ grunts ]
 [ Colin ]
 Hey , hey , hey !
 Come on .
 - [ phone chimes ]
 - [ song ends ]
 - Hey , do you want a lift ? - Uh , no , thanks .
 [ Colin ] Please don 't tell . Maeve ?
 Maeve .
 Yeah ?
 We should talk about what happened .
 [ clears throat ] Is it okay if we don 't tonight ?
 I need to sort my head out .
 That 's okay .
 [ sentimental music playing ]
 - [ both sigh ]
 - [ Maeve ]
 Hm .
 Cal .
 Are we okay ?
 Yeah , yeah . We 're totally fine . I 'll see you on Monday .
 How 'd it go ?
 It was ... 100 % peachy .
 Yeah .

 [ car horns honking ]
 [ phone chimes ] [ cheering ]
 [ cheering continues ]
 Oh , Grandma ! Grandma !
 Come on .
 [ aunt ] Eric ! Eric !
 - Hey , Auntie ! Auntie !
 - Eric ! [ music fades ]
