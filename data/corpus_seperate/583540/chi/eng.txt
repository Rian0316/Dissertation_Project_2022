 - Where 's Mon ?
 - She 's at home . . . . . . putting up decorations for Rachel 's birthday party tonight . - You 're not helping ?
 - I tried . . . . . . but apparently singing " I WiII Survive " in a helium voice , not helping .
 - Hey , guys . - Hey .

 Don 't say that Ioud .
 Gunther 's gonna want to hug me . Good news , everyone .
 We finaIly found a nanny . - This is MoIly . MoIly , Chandler , Joey .
 - Hi .
 Somebody 's getting a Iittle fussy .
 You 're damn right I am . I 've been waiting for a cookie for seven minutes .
 Okay . You know what , I 'm just gonna take her outside .
 - No , you stay . I 'II do it . - Okay .
 Thank you .
 - Nice to meet you guys .
 - Yeah , you too .
 - Wow , MoIly 's just great . - Yeah .
 Yes , bravo on the hot nanny .
 - What ? You reaIly think she 's hot ? - Are you kidding ?
 If I wasn 't married , she 'd be rejecting me right now .
 Joey ? How do you think she 's doing ?

 Am I the only one that doesn 't think she 's hot ? Ross ?
 - I mean , she 's not unattractive , but . . .
 - Right . . . . but hot ? Thank you . Now that Rachel 's gone ?
 So hot , I cried myself to sleep Iast night .

 The One With Phoebe 's Rats
 Hey , Mike , what 's the capitaI of Peru ? - Lima . - No .
 It starts with a V and ends with an X.
 And hopefuIly with a T- O in the middle .
 You know , come to think of it , the capitaI of Peru is " Vtox . "
 - Oh , God ! - What ? Okay .
 I don 't want to freak you out or anything . . . . . . but I just saw a rat in your cupboard . Oh , yeah . No , that 's Bob .

 WeIl , he 's your pet rat ? WeIl , not so much a pet as , you know , an occasionaI visitor . . . . . . who I put food out for .
 Kind of Iike Santa .
 Except Santa doesn 't poop on the plate of cookies .
 You can 't keep a rat in your apartment . They 're unsanitary .
 I mean , they transmit Ieptospirosis and hantavirus .
 - What are those ? - I don 't know . . . . . . but they don 't sound Iike spa treatments .
 - You have to get rid of it . - Okay , fine .
 If it means that much to you , I 'II get rid of Bob . Thank you .
 It 's so weird you think he 's so gross , yet you 're wiIling to eat his crackers .




 - HeIlo . - HeIlo . Gavin , I just want to say thank you again . . . . . . for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation .
 I reaIly owe you an apology .
 - For what ?
 - When we first met , you know . . . . . . I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious . Is this your first apology ?
 No , I just mean , you know , first impressions don 't mean anything .
 And I think you 're a reaIly good guy . And I 'm sorry that I misjudged you . - Morning .
 - HeIlo . But you know what ?
 Hey , new day , new Ieaf .
 I am just reaIly , reaIly happy -- Obviously , Heather 's ass has something more important to say . . . . . . so I 'II just wait tiII it 's finished . I 'm sorry .

 - What ?
 - I was giving you an apology . . . . . . and you were totaIly checking her out . I wasn 't . I 'm in fashion .
 I was Iooking at her skirt . Or was it pants ? I didn 't reaIly see what happened below the ass area .
 Wow , you are reaIly . . . . You 're reaIly a creep .
 What do you care if I was Iooking at her ? Are you jealous ? Oh , yeah .
 I 'm jealous . " Oh , Gavin . Please , please Iook at my ass . "
 Stop Iooking at my ass !
 I mean , I just think you are totaIly inappropriate . Okay ?
 This is a work environment .
 She 's your subordinate .
 But it was okay when you slept with your old assistant , Tag ?
 That is totaIly different for two reasons . One :
 I didn 't know that you knew that . And two :
 I wasn 't some creep staring at his ass .
 We had a . . . . We had a deep , meaningfuI relationship .
 What was Tag 's Iast name ?
 It was . . . .
 Oh , my God . He didn 't -- He didn 't -- He didn 't have a Iast name .
 It was just Tag , you know , Iike Cher or . . . . . . you know , Moses .
 But it was a deep , meaningfuI relationship .
 You know what ? My first impression of you was absolutely right . You are arrogant .
 You are pompous . Morgan ! Morgan !
 - Tag 's Iast name was Morgan ! - It was Jones .
 What are you , his boyfriend ?
 - Man , I wish I had a nanny Iike you .
 - You mean when you were a baby ?
 Sure .
 Would you stop staring at her ?
 I wasn 't staring . I was Ieering .
 What 's the big deaI with her ?
 Maybe she 's attractive in an obvious kind of way . Yeah , obvious beauty 's the worst . You know , when it 's right there in your face .
 Me , I Iike to have to work to find someone attractive .
 Makes me feeI Iike I earned it . Looks Iike Joey 's doing aII right with her .
 Hey , that was nice of you guys to back off . . . . . . and Iet Joey get the girI for once . Yeah .


 - I 'm gonna take her to the apartment . - Okay . I 'II be home right after work .
 - Okay . - Okay , bye , Emma . I love you .
 - Bye . - Bye .
 They 've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk . It 's not so good . I think it 's sweet .
 Bye , Emma !

 Hey , Iisten , Joey .
 About MoIly , I would reaIly prefer if you didn 't go after her .
 - Why not ? - It took months to find a good nanny .
 And I wouldn 't want anything to , you know , drive her away .
 So you think I 'm just gonna sleep with her . . . . . . and never caII her again , and things are gonna get uncomfortable ?
 Yeah , that sounds about right .
 Come on , there are plenty of other women out there .
 Just forget about her , okay ?
 She 's off- Iimits . Oh , man !
 What 'd you have to go and say that for ?
 Now that you told me I can 't have her , makes me want her even more ! - What are you , a child ? - Yes !
 Look , Joey , come on now . For me , please .
 Just try to focus your sexuaI energy on someone else .
 Fine .

 Take me home .

 - Hey , Mikey .
 - Hey , Pheeb . - What are you doing ? - Setting rattraps .
 - To kiII Bob ? - No . No , to test his neck strength .
 No , I don 't want to kiII him .
 I thought we were gonna capture him . . . . . . and , you know , set him free in the countryside . . . . . . where he could meet a friendly possum . . . . . . and a wisecracking owl .
 - Okay , okay .
 I 'II throw away the traps .
 - AII right , I 'II find Bob . I 'II get him .
 Bob ?
 Bob ?
 Robert ?
 Wait , I think I hear him .
 Oh , my God ! Bob had babies !
 Bob 's a mom !
 We 'II have to think of a new name .
 I don 't know , I kind of Iike " Bob " for a girl .
 No , no . I mean , I 'm not sure that we --
 Oh , my God .
 We kiIled Bob ? WeIl , maybe it wasn 't Bob . Maybe it was a mouse .
 Susie ?
 What 's up ?
 Seriously , dude .
 Three years ago .
 Listen , can you do me a favor ? I 'm gonna be out today .
 Can you keep an eye on Joey . . . . . . make sure nothing happens between him and MoIly ? - You don 't trust him ?
 - WeIl , no .
 Some woman who sounded a Iot Iike Joey caIled earlier . . . . . . and asked for her daughter , the " hot nanny . "
 Is this your Iong- term plan , for me to run interference ? Because I could get a job any day now .
 You do appear right on the cusp of something .
 Look , come on , man .
 I 'm sure he 'II Iose interest in a week or two . . . . . . but for now , could you please just do this for me ?
 Fine , but don 't blame me if it doesn 't work .
 Because you know once Joey sets his mind on something . . . . . . more often than not , he 's going to have sex with it .
 WeIl , I mean , we 've gotta do something . Okay ? Nannies Iike her don 't grow on trees .
 - Picturing that tree ? - I am , yes .


 Where you going , Joe ?
 For a walk .
 You mind if I join you ? ActuaIly , I 'd rather be alone .
 You know , I reaIly need to organize my thoughts .
 Your thoughts ?
 Plural ?
 AII right , fine .
 I only have one thought .
 It 's about the hot nanny ! I gotta see her ! - I 'm afraid I can 't Iet you do that , Joe .
 - Now you 're saying I can 't see her ?
 You 're kiIling me !
 She 's forbidden fruit !
 It 's Iike , Iike . . . . . . Iike she 's the princess and I 'm the stable boy .
 Why are you doing this , huh ?
 Did Ross teII you not to Iet me go over there ?
 Yes , as a matter of fact , he did . So I can 't Iet you go .
 Interesting . Now there are obstacles .
 Hot nanny and me against the world !
 This is the stuff great novels are made of .
 - Great novels ? - Fine . Mediocre porn .
 - Gavin MitcheIl 's office . - RacheI Greene 's office . Give me that phone .
 HeIlo , this is RacheI Greene .
 How can I help you ?
 Okay then .
 I 'II pass you back to your son .
 Hey , Mom . No , that 's just my secretary .
 Excuse me , Gavin .
 I have a question I need to ask you .
 Mom , I 'II caII you Iater .
 Yeah .
 - If you Iike Iooking at butts so much . . . . . . why don 't you just go Iook in a mirror ?
 - Yes ?
 Thank God you finaIly said that .
 I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago .
 - Man , I reaIly bug you .
 Don 't I ? - Oh , no . Please . . . . . . I don 't care about you enough to bug me .
 In fact , from now on , I 'm going to take the high road . . . . . . and I 'm going to be very , very nice to you , you mama 's boy . . . . . . starting right now .
 - Hey , Rach .
 - Hi . - Ready for your birthday Iunch ?
 - I am . But first , Monica , I would Iike to introduce you . . . . . . to my very talented coIleague and more importantly . . . . . . my wonderfuI friend , Gavin MitcheIl .

 - Pleased to meet you . - Pleased to meet you . Are you coming to Rachel 's party ?
 Oh , no , no , no , no . Gavin can 't .
 He already has plans . . . . . . most Iikely with his mother .
 I don 't mind . I 'II canceI them . I would never miss my secretary 's birthday .
 Why did you invite him ?
 I can 't stand that guy !
 - You were being so nice to him .
 - I was faking it .
 Can 't you teII when I 'm being fake ? Hey , Mr. PhiIlips .
 Nice suit . Right there . That was so fake !



 I stiII can 't believe you invited Gavin .
 He is just the Iast person I want to see .
 You 're welcome for the party . I 'm glad you 're having a good time .
 I hope he doesn 't show up . Of course he won 't , the guy hates me .
 - Does he ?
 - What ?
 Maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he Iikes you .
 It 's Iike in first grade when Skippy Lange would push me . . . . . . because he secretly had a crush on me .
 Monica , you think Skippy Iiked you ?
 Honey , aII those boys had a bet to see if he could knock you over .
 - She 's out .
 I 'm gonna take her home .
 - Okay .
 Thank you . Bye , sweetheart .

 Do you see what aII the guys see in her ?
 Wouldn 't kick her out of bed .
 No more vodka for me .
 Hey , Rach .
 So can I sing " Happy Birthday " to you now ?
 - Yeah , sure . - AII right .
 See you Iater . Hey , Rach . Somebody got you shoes .
 Give me ! - Wow .
 Wow . Oh , my God ! - Careful !
 Careful !
 These are my rat babies !
 Yeah . We have rat babies now .
 You brought rats to my birthday party ?
 So this is what a stroke feels Iike .
 WeIl , I had to bring them . We kiIled their mother .
 They 're our responsibility now .
 You know , they require constant care . You should know that , you 're a mother .
 Are you comparing my daughter to a rat ?
 No . Seven rats .
 We should take them home .
 We need to feed them .
 You 're gonna Ieave my party to take care of a box of rats ?
 WeIl , I 'm sorry , Rachel , but I 'm not Iike you . Okay ? Not everyone can afford help .

 Hey , where the heII are Joey and MoIly ?
 I asked you to watch them . I 'm sorry . I got a Iittle preoccupied .
 Look , we have to stop them before something happens .
 Right behind you , big guy . So you see , MoIly , what people don 't understand . . . . . . is that acting is a discipline .
 It takes a Iot of hard work .
 - So where 'd you study ?
 - I didn 't go to coIlege . - No , where 'd you study acting ?
 - MoIly , people don 't study acting .

 MoIly , do you mind giving us just a minute ? - Sure . I 'II go check on Emma .
 - Thanks .
 WiII the stable boy never get the princess ?
 What do you think you were gonna do , have sex with her here on my couch ? No .
 The Ieather sticks to my ass . This isn 't fair .
 What makes you think I 'm gonna sleep with her . . . . . . and then blow her off , huh ?
 Can 't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actuaIly Iike her . . . . . . and might want something real ?

 Look , the truth is , I haven 't felt this way about anyone since Rachel .
 Okay ? I didn 't think I could ever love again . - Come on !
 - Joe ! Hi .
 Is MoIly here ?
 Yeah , yeah . Come on in . MoIly ?
 - Hey . Guys , this is Tabitha . - Hey .
 - I 'II see you tomorrow . - Okay .


 WeIl , Joey , I guess we have no problem .
 It 's Iike my favorite fairy tale come true .
 The princess , the stable boy and the Iesbian .

 Okay .
 Okay , you start preparing the formula . . . . . . and I 'II start changing the box .
 And then we gotta put them straight to bed .
 When did we become one of those couples . . . . . . whose Iives revolve around their rats ?
 WeIl , you know what ? They 're our responsibility now .
 Okay , fine .
 These rats are our responsibility . What happens when they mate and there are hundreds ?
 Mate ?
 They 're aII brothers and sisters .
 Yeah , not such a problem with rats . No , they 're more of a " love the one you 're with " kind of animal . No .
 ReaIly ?
 Oh , my -- Get off your sister ! Oh , my God .
 What are we gonna do ? The -- We have seven rats .
 So , what if each of them has seven rats . . . . . . and then each of those has seven rats ? That 's Iike . . . .
 That 's math I can 't even do ! What are we gonna do ?
 WeIl , I know this is gonna sound crazy . . . . . . but we could not Iet the box of rats ruin our Iives .
 Yeah , okay .
 I guess you 're right .
 AII right , so we should just give them away .
 But to nice families with children and reduced- fat Wheat Thins .
 Those were Bob 's favorites .
 It 's gonna be okay . - You must think I 'm crazy .
 - No , I think you 're sweet .
 Good . This is just so hard . It 's hard for me to Iet them go .
 I guess it just brings back memories , you know . . . . . . from when I gave birth to my brother 's triplets and I had to give them up .

 I haven 't told you about that yet , have I ?


 Thanks for the party , honey . Should I help you clean up ? No way .
 You had your party . Now I have mine .
 - Is everything aII right ?
 - I just get bummed . . . . . . when my birthday 's over .
 WeIl , at Ieast you have one thing to be happy about .
 That jerk , Gavin , from your office didn 't show up .
 Yeah , I hate him . We weren 't talking about you .
 We were . . . . No . No way to recover .
 No .
 Okay .
 - Fun party .
 - WeIl , it was . And you would have seen it if you didn 't show up at . . . . 9 : 30 ? !
 God !
 This party was Iame .
 Again , you 're welcome !
 - Look , I 'II just give you this and go .
 - You bought me a present . Why ?
 Let me explain how birthday parties usuaIly work .
 There are presents . . . . . . and a cake , perhaps a fourth or fifth person .
 Okay , I. . . .
 I got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you .
 WeIl , okay . WeIl , that 's very nice .
 And you wrote a card . - " From Gavin . " - I reaIly mean it .

 It 's beautiful . If you don 't mind . . . ?
 Let me .
 WeIl , what do you know , it fits .
 See , Gavin . You 're capable of being a nice guy .
 Why do you give me such a hard time ?
 I 'm not sure .
 WeIl , Monica seems to think it 's because you have feelings for me .
 I do have feelings for you .
 - You do ?
 - Yes . I feeI that you 're a Iittle annoying . See , why ?
 Gavin , why ?
 Right when I 'm about to change my opinion of you , you go and you --

 And you do that .










 Hey .
 Listen , I think I Ieft something here . WeIl , somebody Ieft this .
 Is this yours ?
 No , but I Iike it . No , I think I Ieft one of my rat babies .
 WeIl , no .
 I haven 't seen it , but if I do , I 'II Iet you know .
 Rat baby ! Rat baby ! Rat baby !
 Rat baby ! Maybe that 's him .
