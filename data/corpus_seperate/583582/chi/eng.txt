 - I 'm sorry ! - Oh , my God ! That 's it !
 You just barge in here and you don 't knock ?
 You have no respect for my privacy ? - Rachel , wait ! - No , you wait !
 Can I just say one thing ? What ? !
 What ?
 That 's a relatively open weave and I can stiII see your . . . . . . nippular area .
 The One With the Boobies



 English Subtitles by GELULA & CO . , INC .

 Honey , honey . . . . . . teII them the story about your patient . . . . . . who thinks things are other things .
 Like when the phone rings and she takes a shower . . . .
 That 's pretty much it .
 But you teII it reaIly weIl , sweetie . Thanks .
 Now go away so we can talk about you .
 Okay . I 'II miss you .
 Isn 't he great ?
 He 's so cute . And he Iikes you so much .
 I know . I know .
 He 's so sweet .
 And so complicated , you know ?
 And for a shrink , he 's not too shrinky .
 You know ? Think you 'II do it on his couch ?
 I don 't know . That 's a Iittle weird .
 It 's vinyl . . . .
 You guys want anything else ?
 - Could I have -- - We 're aII out .
 Anybody else ? Did I miss something ?
 No , she 's stiII upset because I saw her boobies .
 What were you doing seeing her boobies ? It was an accident .
 I wasn 't across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts .
 Can we change the subject , please ?
 Because , heIlo ?
 These aren 't her " boobies . " These are her breasts .
 Pheebs , I was hoping for more of a change .
 I don 't know why you 're embarrassed .
 They were very nice boobies .
 " Nice " ? They were " nice " ? That 's it ?
 I mean , mittens are " nice . "
 Rock , hard place . . . . . . me .
 You 're so funny !
 He 's reaIly funny !
 I wouldn 't want to be there when the Iaughter stops .
 Back up there , sparky .
 What did you mean by that ?
 It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues . . . . . . that you use your humor to keep people at a distance .
 I mean , I just met you .
 I don 't know you from Adam .
 Only child , right ?
 Parents divorced before you hit puberty .
 How did you know ? It 's textbook .
 Hey , you guys .
 You aII know my dad , right ?
 - How Iong are you in the city ?
 - Two days . I got a job midtown .
 I 'm better off staying with the kid . . . . . . than going back and forth on the ferry .
 I don 't know this one .
 This is my friend Roger .
 - Good to meet you .
 - You too . What happened to the puppet guy ? Dad !
 Excuse me . So , Ross , how 's the wife ?
 0 for 2 , huh ?
 Chandler , quick , say something funny !
 Gotta go . I miss you too .
 I love you , but it 's getting Iate now --
 Let me say hi . Hey , Ma !
 Listen , I made the appointment with Dr. Bassida and --
 Excuse me ?
 Did you know this isn 't Ma ?
 Her name 's Ronni . She 's a pet mortician .
 Sure .
 So how Iong have you been . . . .
 Remember when you were a kid , we 'd go see the big ships in the navy yard ?
 Since then ?
 No , it 's only been six years .
 I wanted to give you a nice memory . . . . . . so you 'd know I wasn 't always such a terrible guy .
 Joe , have you ever been in Iove ?
 I don 't know . Then you haven 't .
 You 're burning your tomatoes .
 You 're one to talk .
 Your dad 's in Iove , bigtime .
 And the worst part is , it 's with two different women .
 Oh , man ! Please teII me one of them is Ma .
 Of course one of them 's Ma .
 What 's the matter with you ?
 It 's Iike if you woke up one day and found out . . . . . . your dad was Ieading this double Iife .
 He 's Iike actuaIly some spy working for the ClA .
 That 'd be cool !
 This blows !
 I know .
 Why can 't parents just stay parents ?
 Why do they have to become people ? Why do they have --
 Why . . . . . . can 't you stop staring at my breasts ?
 What ?
 What ?
 Didn 't you get a good enough Iook the other day ?
 We 're aII adults here .
 There 's only one way to resolve this .
 Since you saw her boobies . . . . . . you 're gonna have to show her your pee- pee .
 You know , I don 't see that happening .
 Come on . He 's right .
 Tit for tat .
 WeII I 'm not showing you my tat !
 - It 's Phoebe . - And Rog !
 Come on up .
 Oh , good ! Rog is here !
 - What 's the matter with Rog ?
 - Nothing . It 's a Iittle thing .
 I hate that guy !
 What ? So he was a Iittle analytical .
 That 's what he does . Come on , he 's not that bad .
 That 's where you 're wrong !
 Why would I marry her . . . . . . if I thought on any IeveI that she was a Iesbian ?
 I don 't know .
 Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail .
 Why ? Why would I ? Why ?
 I don 't know . Maybe Iow self- esteem ?
 Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling .
 Wait ! Go back to that " sibling " thing .
 WeIl , I don 't know .
 It 's conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage . . . . . . so the sibling would be Iess of a failure in the parents ' eyes .
 That 's ridiculous !
 I don 't feeI guilty for her failures .
 - So you think I 'm a failure ?
 - Isn 't he good ? That 's not what I was saying .
 I thought you were on my side . . . . . . but maybe you were sucking up to Mom and Dad . . . . . . so they 'd favor you .
 I married a Iesbian to make you Iook good !
 You 're right .
 I mean , you 're right !
 It wasn 't just the Weebles , but it was the Weeble Play Palace . . .
 . . . and the Weeble 's Cruise Ship . . . . . . which had this Iittle Iifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in .
 That 's tough , tough stuff .
 Pheebs , if we 're gonna catch that movie , we gotta go .
 FeeI better , okay ?
 We 're gonna be Iate , sweetie .
 Thanks for everything , Mon .
 No problem . It was great seeing you again .
 Mon , easy on those cookies , okay ?
 Remember , they 're just food . . . . . . they 're not Iove .
 I hate that guy !
 Good night , you guys .
 Oh , Iook ! It 's the woman we ordered .
 Can we help you ?
 No , thanks . I 'm just waiting for Joey Tribbiani .
 I 'm Joey Tribbiani .
 Oh , no , not you . Big Joey .
 Oh , my God ! You 're so much cuter than your pictures .
 I 'm Ronni .
 Cheese nip ?
 Joey 's having an embolism . . . . . . but I 'd go for a nip .
 Most people , when their pets pass on . . . . . . want them Iaid out Iike they 're sleeping .
 OccasionaIly you get a person who wants them in a pose .
 Like chasing their tail .
 Or jumping to catch a Frisbee .
 Joey , if I go first , I want to be Iooking for my keys .
 That 's a good one !
 Hey , Dad . Ronni 's here .
 HeIlo , babe !
 What are you doing here ?
 You Ieft your hair at my place .
 I thought you 'd need it for your meeting .
 Thank you .
 So ! Who 's up for a big game of Kerplunk ?
 Look , I. . . . I shouldn 't have come .
 I gotta go . I 'II miss the Iast train .
 I don 't want you taking that thing this Iate .
 Where am I gonna stay ?
 Here ?
 We 'II go to a hotel .
 We 'II go to a hotel .
 - No , you won 't . - No , we won 't .
 If you go to a hotel , you 'II be doing stuff .
 I want you right here , where I can keep an eye on you .
 You 're gonna keep an eye on us ?
 Right , mister !
 I don 't care how old you are , while you 're here . . . . . . you 're gonna Iive by my rules .
 And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend .
 Wow , he 's strict .
 Dad , you 'II be in my room .
 Ronni , you can stay in Chandler 's room .
 Thanks .
 You 're a good kid .
 Come on . I 'II show you to my room .
 That sounds weird when it 's not foIlowed by , " No , thanks , it 's Iate ! "
 This is just for tonight . Starting tomorrow , you gotta change .
 - Six years is Iong enough !
 - What kind of change ? - Break up with Ronni -- - I can 't !
 Then come clean with Ma ! This is not right !
 I don 't wanna hear it !
 Now go to my room !
 Hey , kickie !
 What are you doing ? Trying to get comfortable .
 - I can 't sleep in my underwear . - WeIl , you 're gonna .
 I 've been thinking . . . . . . about how I 'm always seeing girls on top of girls . . . .
 Are they end- to- end , or taIl , Iike pancakes ?
 You know what I mean .
 How I date aII these women .
 I always figured , when the right one comes along . . . . . . I 'II be able to be a standup guy and go the distance .
 Now I 'm Iooking at my Dad thinking --
 You 're not him , you 're you .
 When they wanted you to go into your father 's business , did you cave ?
 You chose the out- of- work- actor business .
 That wasn 't easy , but you did it .
 And I believe that when the right woman comes along . . . . . . you 'II have the guts to say :
 " No thanks , I 'm married . "
 You reaIly think so ?
 I reaIly do .
 - Thanks , Chandler . - Get off !
 May I help you ?
 Joey said I could use your shower since Chandler 's in ours .
 Who are you ? Oh , I 'm Ronni . Ronni Rapalono .
 The mistress ?
 - Come on in . - Thanks .
 I 'm Rachel .
 Bathroom 's up there .
 Say , Ronni . . . . How Iong has Chandler been in the shower ?
 Like five minutes . Perfect .
 Fasten your seat belts . . . . . . it 's pee- pee time !
 Hey , Mr. Trib .
 Good morning , dear .
 Chandler Bing , it 's time to see your thing .
 - What 's with you ?
 - I thought it was Chandler !
 You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing !
 Sorry , my thing was in there with me .

 How 's it going ?
 Good . Roger 's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys .
 What 's going on ? Nothing .
 It 's just that . . . . It 's Roger .
 There 's something about --
 BasicaIly , we just feeI that he 's . . . .
 We hate that guy !
 We hate him ! We 're sorry , Pheebs .
 Don 't you think maybe it 's just that he 's so perceptive . . . . . . that it freaked you out ?
 - No , I hate him ! - No , we hate him ! I 'm sorry .
 Ma ! What are you doing here ?
 I came to give you this . . . . . . and this !
 Big ring !
 Why did you fiII your father 's head with that garbage . . . . . . about making things right ?
 Things were fine the way they were !
 There 's chicken in there . Put it away .
 For God 's sake , Joey ! ReaIly .
 Hold on . You knew ?
 Of course I knew .
 What do you think ? Your father is no James Bond .
 You should have heard his cover stories .
 " I 'm sleeping over at my accountant 's . "
 I mean , what is that ? Please !
 So then , how could you -- ? Do you remember how your father used to be ?
 Always yeIling .
 Nothing made him happy .
 Not that wood shop , not those stupid Iittle ships in the bottle .
 Now he 's happy . I mean , it 's nice . He has a hobby .
 Ma , I don 't mean to be disrespectful , but . . . . . . what the heII are you saying ?
 - I mean , what about you ? - Me ? I 'm fine .
 Look , honey . . . . . . in an ideaI world . . . . . . there 'd be no her and your father would Iook Iike Sting .
 And I 'II teII you something else :
 Ever since that poodle- stuffer came along . . . . . . he 's been so ashamed of himself that he 's been more attentive .
 He 's been more Ioving . It 's Iike every day is our anniversary .
 I 'm happy for you . . . ?
 WeIl , don 't be !
 Because now everything 's screwed up .
 I just want it the way it was .
 Ma , I 'm sorry .
 I just did what I thought you 'd want .
 I know you did , cookie .
 I know you did .
 So teII me . . . . Did you see her ?
 You 're ten times prettier than she is .
 That 's sweet .
 Could I take her ?
 With this ring , no contest !
 - What 's wrong , sweetie ? - Nothing . . . .
 What 's wrong ? Come on .
 It 's nothing .
 I 'm fine . It 's just -- It 's my friends .
 They have a Iiking problem with you . . . . . . in that . . . . . . they don 't .

 They don 't ? But you know . . . . . . they don 't see aII of the wonderfulness that I see .
 They don 't see aII the good stuff and aII the sweet stuff .
 They think you 're a Iittle . . . . What ?
 Intense and creepy .
 But I don 't . Me , Phoebe .
 I 'm not at aII surprised they feeI that way .
 You 're not ? That 's why you 're so great .
 ActuaIly , it 's quite typicaI behavior . . . . . . when you have this kind of dysfunctionaI group dynamic .
 You know , this kind of codependent . . . . . . emotionaIly stunted . . . . . . sitting in your stupid coffeehouse , with your stupid big cups . . . . . . which , I 'm sorry , might as weII have nipples on them .

 And you 're aII Iike , " Oh , define me ! Define me !
 Love me ! I need Iove ! "
 So you talked to your dad ?
 He 's gonna keep cheating on Ma , Iike she wanted .
 Ma 's gonna keep pretending she doesn 't know .
 And my sister Tina can 't see her husband anymore . . . . . . because he got a restraining order .
 Which has nothing to do with it , except that I found out today .
 Things have changed here on Walton 's mountain .
 So Joey , are you okay ?
 Yeah , I guess . It 's just -- You know , they 're parents .
 After a certain point , you gotta Iet go .
 Even if you know better . . . . . . you gotta Iet them make their own mistakes .
 And just think . . . . . . in a few years , we 'II turn into them .
 Oh , please !
 If I turn into my parents , I 'II either be an alcoholic blond . . . . . . chasing after 20- year- old boys . . . . . . or I 'II end up Iike my mom !
 How 's it going ?
 Okay , except I broke up with Roger .
 Yeah , right ! What happened ?
 I don 't know . I mean . . . .
 He 's a good person . . . . . . and he can be reaIly sweet .
 And in some ways , I think he is so right for me .
 It 's just . . . . I hate that guy !
 What 's going on ?
 Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express .
 Next stop , RacheI Greene .
 Joey , what the heII were you doing ?
 Sorry , wrong boobies !
 HeIlo , Joey !
 HeIlo , dear !
