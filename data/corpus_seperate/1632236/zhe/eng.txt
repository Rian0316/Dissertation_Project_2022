 00 : 00 : 01, 613 -- > 00 : 00 : 05, 883 My new book takes on a grand question :
 Is our universe the only universe ?
 You see , there 's a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos .
 In Reality , I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader .
 Hysterical .
 I 'm glad you talked me into this . We work so hard , sometimes , it 's nice to goof off
 - and do something silly .
 - Agreed .
 Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd .
 You may actually believe you 're in a comedy club .
 You can think about Heisenberg 's " Uncertainty Principle " much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants , where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B , and if you order the first dish in column A , you can 't order the corresponding dish in column B.


 That 's sort of like the " Uncertainly Principle . " ♪ Ba- dum- bump . ♪
 Say , I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette .
 Really , Amy ?
 Gossip ?
 I 'm disappointed in you .
 Now , now .
 Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups .
 Forgive my language , but " poppycock . "
 What if he 's right ?
 And by not participating in gossip , society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish ?

 Fine .
 In the parlance of the urban music scene ,
 " What 's the 4- 1- 1 " ?
 Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard . I believe our nation 's tuna cans are safe .
 Excuse me .
 Dr. Greene , question ?
 Yes ?
 You 've dedicated your life 's work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas .
 Yes , in part .
 Have you ever considered trying to do something useful ?

 Perhaps , reading to the elderly ? Excuse me ?
 Yeah , but not your books ; something they might enjoy .
 I kid , of course . Big fan .

 - Nice shot .
 - Thank you .
 My father taught me archery as a child .
 It 's odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon .
 - Perfect .
 - I know .
 What an elf I would have made .
 Whoo .
 What do you think you 're doing ?
 Shooting at a target ?
 With what ?
 - An arrow .
 - Really ?
 I didn 't see you draw one from your quiver .
 I 'm not going to do that , Sheldon .
 Leonard , the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience .
 We have to do our part , too .
 That was uncalled for , but ... I 'll play along ...
 Ow !

 I had an unusual experience with Amy last night . Really ?
 How could you tell ?
 She was attempting to engage me in gossip . - Mm . You don 't say .
 - Yes .
 I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie .
 So , what 's the gossip ?
 Oh , please , I was just pointing it out .
 I have no desire to engage in the activity .
 Fine , don 't tell me .
 All right , get this .
 Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard . Oh ...
 That 's too bad .
 I wonder what happened .
 Mm , it 's hard to say .
 I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents ' marriage implode .
 In that case , the woman dives into religion , while the man dives into a bottle- blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures .

 Oop !
 Out of arrows .

 Boy , you sure get your money 's worth out of these games .
 - Priya , can I come in ? - Sure .

 Oh , God . What ?
 It 's okay .
 You didn 't know .
 I 'll take care of it .
 What- what did I do ?
 Sheldon doesn 't allow flossing that close to the mirror .
 You 're kidding .
 It 's a splatter thing .
 There 's a little piece of tape on the floor you 're supposed to stand behind .
 - That 's madness .
 - I know . There 's a big inspection coming up , and I don 't want to lose my TV privileges . Just do it .




 You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement , one of these days .
 Mm , I don 't know .
 I get a lawyer , he gets a lawyer ...
 It 's just easier to stand behind the tape .
 Oh , by the way , a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend .
 - Does that sound like fun ?
 - Yeah !
 Dodgers are baseball , right ?
 You 'll need to explain the game to me . Mm , it 's complicated .
 But as I remember it , the essentials are
 " get chosen last , get hit by the ball , cry , go home . "
 Well , regardless , I 've got four tickets . And I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard .
 She 's really interesting , and I bet I can get used to him .
 Well , it might not be a great idea - to invite those two .
 - Why not ?
 Don 't tell anybody I told you , but I heard she might be breaking up with him .
 Oh ... too bad ...
 Although I do know one person for whom that 's good news .
 Really ? Who ?
 My brother .
 He 's got a big crush on Bernadette .

 What ?
 You 're kidding !
 No .
 I found poems he wrote about her .
 Very disturbing .
 " Oh , Bernadette , please play my clarinet . "
 - Wow , that 's hard to believe . - Yes .
 And for years , everyone in my family was convinced that was the clarinet enthusiast .
 Hmm .
 What 's that piece of tape ?
 Oh , that one doesn 't apply to you .
 You sit .
 - Hey !
 - Hey !
 How 's it going ?
 Not too bad .
 Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette ?
 ' Course I heard about it .
 How did you hear about it ?
 I heard about it from Sheldon .
 - He got it from Amy .
 - Oh , damn it .
 I told Amy that in the strictest confidence .
 Boy , some people are such blabbermouths .
 Well , whatever .
 I 'm sure Bernadette can do better .
 Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred- pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom ?
 You are kidding .
 Raj likes Bernadette ?
 I didn 't say Raj .
 Who said

 Okay , give .
 How do you know ? Did he tell you ?
 - No .
 - Well , then who ?
 I can 't say ...
 Priya told you .
 What a little gossip .
 You know , not an attractive quality in a woman , Leonard .
 Not judging , just my opinion .
 Well , The point is , if this got out , it would destroy Howard and Raj 's friendship .
 You don 't have to worry .
 Unlike Amy and Priya , I know how to keep a secret .
 You 're the one who told Amy in the first place . In confidence !

 Hello , Mummy .
 Hello , Daddy .
 How are you ?
 We 're very rich in a very poor country .
 So , all in all , can 't complain .
 So , Priya , how are enjoying staying with your brother ?
 It 's fine .
 But if I 'm going to stay in Los Angeles much longer ,
 I think I should get my own place .
 Why ?
 Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable ?
 Rajesh , why aren 't you making your sister comfortable ?
 I am making her comfortable .
 Besides , she 's not sleeping here half the time anyw ...
 What ?
 Where are you sleeping , Priya ?
 It 's a figure of speech , Daddy .
 It means I- I work late .
 Please tell me you 're not dating an American . I knew this would happen .
 Rajesh , are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy ?
 Now , hold on .
 If she is dating an American , that 's not a bad way to go .
 He 's Jewish .
 Those chaps are very successful , and they don 't drink a lot .
 It- It doesn 't matter .
 Howard has a girlfriend .
 - For now . - What does that mean ?
 I 'll tell you later .
 Is something going on with him and Bernadette ?
 - Who 's Bernadette ?
 - Doesn 't sound Jewish .
 You can 't tell by that .
 Winona Ryder is Jewish .
 Okay , we 're getting off the subject .
 Rajesh , I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome .
 Thank you , Daddy .
 Don 't worry .
 Everything I have , I share with her .
 Including my friend Leon ...
 Good night , Mummy .
 Good night , Daddy .
 Oh , my God , I think you broke my toe !
 You should have kept your mouth shut . Fair enough .
 Now , what 's up with Clarinet ... ?
 Bernadette !

 I 've been thinking about Dr. Greene 's efforts to make science palatable for the masses .
 Oh , yeah ?
 What about it ?
 That 's all .
 I 've just been thinking about it .

 Now , I 'm thinking about fractal equations .
 Now I 'm thinking about the origin of the phrase " train of thought . "
 Now I 'm thinking about trains .
 Are you listening to this guy ? Hmm ? Oh , I 'm sorry .

 I was somewhere else .
 Lucky bastard .
 Now I 'm thinking about Jell- O.
 So what 's up ?
 It 's a Bernadette thing .
 Oh , no .
 I hope everything 's okay .
 Whatever it is , we 're here for you . You can tell us anything .
 Yeah .
 Good or devastating .

 I 'm gonna ask her to marry me . - Marry you ? - What ?
 - Yeah .
 I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question .
 - Oh , I 'd wait .
 - No rush , no rush .
 Oh , great .
 It 's my cousin David about the ring .
 Hey , David , what 'd you find ?
 Sure , a half a caret 's fine .
 Her freakishly small hands make anything look big .
 It 's one of the reasons I love her .
 Man , he 's going to be blindsided . I know .
 It 'll be awful .
 Why are you smiling ? Yeah , Raj , why ?
 Uh , a smile means something different in my country .
 You know , tears of joy , smile of sadness . India 's a goofy place .
 Oh , I 'm back to trains .
 Woo- woo .
 Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction ?
 - No .
 - Fascinating work .
 I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes .
 Have you learned anything ? Yes .
 He looks much cooler than the non- smoking monkeys .
 Although it 's not much of a contest .
 The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate .

 If you don 't mind , I 'd like to stop listening to you and start talking .
 By all means .
 Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette .
 I don 't understand . The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup .
 I know .
 The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating , soul- crushing rejection .
 Everyone was set a- twitter .
 Although oddly , no one tweeted .
 It 's not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends .
 Are you familiar with meme theory ?
 I 'm familiar with everything , but go on .
 Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host .
 I 'm no stranger to memetic epidemiology .
 At Johnson Elementary School , the phrase " Shelly Cooper 's a smelly pooper " spread like wildfire .
 I should think so .
 That 's gold .
 Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me .
 How might we examine this more closely ?
 Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation ?
 It 's one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don 't find repellent .
 We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip .
 And a second non- tantalizing piece to use as a control .
 Then we 'll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory , algebraic gossip and epidemiology .
 Look at you , getting me to engage in the social sciences .
 You 're a vixen , Amy Farrah Fowler .

 Oh , hey , Amy .
 What 's up ?
 Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse .
 In other news , I 'm thinking of starting an herb garden .
 Mum 's the word .
 Gotta go .


 Oh , hey , Raj , what are you doing here ?
 I just felt like drinking alone ... because I 'm deep and dark .
 Uh- huh . So , uh , Howard 's not here ?
 No .
 It 's just one of those times when it 's just you and me .
 Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke .

 Do you remember that ?
 Yeah .
 Me , too . Good times .

 Alright , 16 wants to order appetizers .
 - Oh , thanks .
 - This was nice .


 What the hell are you doing ?
 Howard is your best friend , and that is his girlfriend . You should be ashamed of yourself .
 I was when I came in , but it 's amazing what liquor does to guilt .
 Besides what you might not know is ...
 Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard .
 Well , I know that . How do you know that ? My sister told me .
 Oh , that gossipy bitch !
 No offense .
 None taken .
 You should hear how she talks about you .

 Okay , listen , just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems , does not mean you should be here sniffing around .
 What can I do ?
 I can 't stop thinking about her .
 All right , try thinking about this ...
 Sheldon and Amy had sex .
 Shut your ass !

 Yeah , it 's true .
 Amy told me .
 How did that even happen ?
 Did they know that 's what they were doing when they were doing it ?
 I- I guess they just figured it out at some point .
 Wow . I can 't believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid .
 - Hey .
 - Hey .
 Hope you 're hungry .
 Interesting .
 A friendly sentiment in this country , cruel taunt in the Sudan .
 It 's a lesson in context .
 Will Amy be joining us for dinner ? Yes , I believe so .
 Good , good .
 Everything ... okay between you two ?

 Yes .
 Why do you ask ?
 No reason .
 I was just talking to Raj , and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days .
 Did he mean as if she 'd been out in the sun , tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock ?
 No .
 That 's not what he meant .
 Well , we may never know .
 As my mother would say , the Asians are an inscrutable folk .
 Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have work to do .
 Yeah , you do . You dog , you .


 Did you get that ?
 Every word . Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda .

 This is moving faster than we thought .
 Agreed .
 It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared .
 I must say , Amy , pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction .
 Slow down , Sheldon .
 I 'm not quite there yet .

 - Pass the soy sauce .
 - Sure .
 Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you .
 The meme has reached full penetration .
 Pun intended ?
 No . Happy accident .

 This is remarkable .
 Took less than 24 hours .
 I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance .
 Interesting .
 So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a " blow by blow , " as it were .
 Pun intended ?
 I 'm sorry . What pun ?

 Not important .
 I described your lovemaking as " aloof , but effective . "
 I wish you hadn 't done that .
 That 's going to make me a chick magnet , and I 'm so busy as it is .
 Hey , everybody ,
 I got something I want to ask Bernadette , and I can 't think of a better time than when I 'm with all my friends .
 Oh , hold on , Howard .
 There 's lots of better times .
 Leonard , please . The man is talking .
 Let him get it out , and let the chips fall where they may .
 Thank you .
 Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski ...
 Oh , God . What 's happening ?
 I know things haven 't been perfect with us , and we 've had our problems , but I just have to tell you , from the moment I ...
 Howard , let me just stop you right here .
 This is it .
 Yes .
 Yes , what ?
 Yes , I will marry you . - You will ?
 - You will ? I will .

 I will !
 Oh , I love you so much .
 Oh , I love you , too .
 Congratulations !
 Oh , it 's so exciting .

 I wonder what changed her mind .
 Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love .
 As good an explanation as any .
 That 's great ...

 Oh , hey , Amy .
 Bernadette just texted me .
 Howard proposed ?
 Yes , not important .
 Just stopped by to let you know I 'm getting orthotics .
 Also , I 'm carrying Sheldon 's baby .
 Mum 's the word .



 You 're pregnant ? !
 Is there anything on there about orthotics ? == Corrected by www . addicted . com ==
 Wow .
