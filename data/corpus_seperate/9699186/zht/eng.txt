 00 : 00 : 06, 960 -- > 00 : 00 : 09, 960 What are you learning in that class ? Your fingers are all wrong .
 You 're so picky , Mum .
 If you 're going to do something , do it well .
 [ knock at door ]
 Who 's that ?
 Um , it 's my dance partner . We 're having extra rehearsals together .
 - I already told you . - Yes , but I ...
 Don 't stop and talk .
 Remember , she thinks your parents are Indian .
 [ door closes ]
 Hi , Mrs. Hanan , it 's nice to meet you .
 Keep an eye on her little finger .
 [ Olivia ] Mum !
 - [ Olivia laughing ]

 [ Olivia continues laughing ]

 [ moaning ]
 [ Olivia ]
 Brr ... [ moans ]
 I 'm gonna cum . I 'm gonna cum .
 [ moaning loudly ]
 [ Olivia moaning ]
 [ gasps , exhales ]
 [ Malek ] Liv , you 're crazy .

 You just did it again .
 I 'm sorry .
 [ " Happy Talk " by Captain Sensible playing ]
 [ music continues through headphones ] [ music continues normally ]
 [ music continues muffled in background ]
 What have you done that for ?
 I took it to the car wash two days ago .
 - [ squelch ]
 - Oh , for God 's sake , Adam !
 You left the bloody window open ! [ incoming text alert ]

 Arseholes .

 [ exhales angrily ]

 Sorry .

 [ music slows down ]
 - What you doing ?
 - [ man panting ]
 He 's wanking on me !
 [ passengers whispering ]
 Can I get off the bus , please ?
 - [ woman ] Watch it with the cake .
 - Sorry .
 - Can I get off the bus , please ? - [ driver ]
 You all right , love ? Yeah , I just need to get off the bus , please .
 [ " Happy Talk " playing slowly ]
 [ music playing normally ]
 He jizzed on me .
 What the shit is this ?
 It 's my magician 's hankie .
 You 're not a fucking magician , Jeffrey .
 - Maeve . - Yeah ?
 You know what today is , don 't you ?
 Rent day .
 Oh , yeah , Uh , I 'll get that to you later today .
 Oh .
 [ Cynthia ] Such a sweet boy .
 Apparently , it was a terrible incident .
 He was attacked ... by a gang of youths .
 [ Jeffrey ] Shouldn 't be so nosy , Cynthia .
 Magic that hankie to the bin , Jeffrey .
 Twat .
 - [ Maureen ] Michael . - What ?
 He trying .
 [ sighs ]
 [ sighs ]
 - Sorry , Dad .
 - [ dog whimpering ]
 I 've got you a trial shift at Brown 's this evening at eight .
 He 's doing me a favor so do not be late .
 [ car engine starting ]
 Why are you wearing a scarf ?
 - Is that for Rahim ? - No .
 - No . I just like scarves , okay ? - Uh- huh .
 - Dude , why is your mum still here ? - I don 't know .
 - She lives here , apparently . - Hello , Eric .
 - Hello , darling .
 - Don 't address me at school , Mum .
 Oh , don 't forget dinner tonight .
 It 's okay , that 's it . You can go back to pretending I don 't exist .
 What 's dinner tonight ?
 Dinner tonight is me , my mum , Ola , and Jakob all getting to know each other like a big happy family .
 I can 't believe you finally get a girlfriend and she 's basically your sister .
 [ laughing ]
 LOLs . LOLs .
 Oh , you don 't think anyone will tell your mum about the whole sex clinic thing though , do you ?
 ' Cause that 'll be awkward .
 Innit ?
 [ Eric ] Everyone 's gonna talk to your mum ?
 No one will talk to my mum about anything ...
 - Yeah , especially not ... - Good morning , Eric .
 - Morning , Rahim . [ chuckles ] - I like your scarf .
 Oh , this ? Forgot I had it on .
 Could I ask you something ? [ Eric ]
 Yeah .
 Hmm .
 - [ clears throat ] - Oh , yeah .
 Um ...
 All right , yeah , I 'll just go inside .
 - Yeah , okay . Cool . - Okay .
 [ Rahim ]
 Um ...
 I was wondering if you would like to go out with me sometime ?
 What ? Like , on ... on a date ?
 Yeah . Maybe tonight ?
 Y- Yes , sure .
 Cool , I 'll be there .
 Cool , um , you decide what we do ,
 ' cause I don 't know what 's cool to do in this town .
 [ Jackson ]
 Ooh .
 - You auditioning for the play ? - [ scoffs ] Yeah , I 'm going up for Juliet .
 Who 's that ?
 I 'm joking . Someone just gave it to me . It 's stupid .
 [ " Prove It " by Lee Harvey playing ]

 [ exhales ]
 [ Jean ] Oh , come in . Take a seat .
 Remember , this is a completely safe place to share .
 I 'm sorry , this used to be the history classroom .
 Bye then .
 [ door closes ]
 [ bell ringing ]
 Shit .
 [ clears throat ]
 Lily , hi . Uh , question .
 Did you just ... You didn 't tell my mum about the whole , you know , my ...
 Being a sex wizard ?
 Yeah .
 No . It didn 't come up .
 - What are you looking at ? - [ gasps ] My mum .
 [ clears throat ]
 - It 's my mum . - Wow , she 's really getting to you .
 I don 't trust her .
 So dinner tonight 's gonna be interesting .
 We don 't have to go .
 How about we tell them we 're not going ?
 [ sighs ] Come on .
 At least they 're trying to make it less weird .
 If it gets too much , we can just go to your room and play
 - Okay . - Okay ?
 - Yes , okay . Um ...
 - Awesome .
 [ Ola ] I 'll see you later .
 - I need to see Otis . - Okay .
 Uh , no , we don 't do discounts .
 It 's all I 've got until I get my pocket money .
 You have a sex problem , but you still get pocket money ?
 - [ mumbles ] - Well , we 're not a charity , okay ?
 So come back with the cash , and I 'll book you in .
 [ Otis ] New client ?
 No .
 [ clears throat ] Got a couple tomorrow though .
 Look , um ...
 I think my mum being on campus might be bad for business .
 - I think you 're being paranoid . - You don 't know my mum , all right ?
 She says she 's just doing research .
 Before you know it , she 's in everyone 's head .
 Okay . We 'll keep an eye on it .
 [ Aimee ] Happy birthday ! I baked a cake !
 - Why didn 't you say it was your birthday ? - Because I hate birthdays .
 No one hates birthdays , Maeve .
 Why celebrate the day I got pushed out of some random vagina against my will ?
 [ chuckles ]
 Think of all those gems of nihilistic wisdom the world would be missing if you hadn 't been born .
 Happy birthday , oh , joyous one .
 Just tell him you like him , already .
 So , what do you wanna do for your birthday ?
 Nothing .
 What happened to this cake , exactly ?
 Oh , it didn 't look so bad before , but then I was on the bus , and a guy wanked on my leg , and I got a bit of a shock , and I smushed the cake .
 What ?
 Do you think it 'll stain ?
 I love these jeans .
 You ... you have to report it .
 It 's fine , they were only cheap .
 No , you 've been assaulted .
 I think he was just lonely , or not right in the head or something , which is weird ' cause he was quite handsome .
 Aimes , this is serious .
 It 's silly . I 'm fine , honestly .
 Okay . I know what I want to do for my birthday .
 I want us to go to the police .
 Where did you take Ola on your first date ?
 Um ... we didn 't really go on any dates .
 [ clears throat ]
 Just started hanging out .
 What do you mean ?
 You know , like playing video games , talking , eating cereal .
 Otis , that 's what you and me do .
 Yes , except I don 't kiss you .
 I think French people like to go on proper dates .
 - Where should I take him ? [ sighs ] - Okay , just don 't stress .
 Just as long as you guys are together , I don 't think it matters .
 I don 't even know why I 'm asking you .
 You 've never even been on a date .
 [ phone playing game sounds ]
 [ deep male voice on phone ]

 How are your chats with the students going ?
 Seems a little quiet .
 It 's ... still early .
 Hmm .
 I wanted to reiterate that you have not been employed at Moordale as a counselor .
 Yes .
 You 've made that more than clear .
 I 'm only speaking to the students about the curriculum .
 If they ever come to speak to you , that is .
 Welcome !
 Hi , I 'm here to talk about SRE stuff .
 Yes , of course you are .
 Please , have a seat , and ... could you possibly just close the door on your way out , Mr. Groff ?
 Thank you !
 Right .
 What 's your name ?
 Malek Amir .
 Malek Amir . Nice to meet you , Malek .
 I don 't have to pay for this , do I ?
 No .
 Right , so ... what do you feel the SRE curriculum is currently missing ?
 Okay , so a friend of mine is dating a girl who keeps putting a pillow over his face when they have sex .
 Would the curriculum cover that , maybe ?
 Interesting .
 Adding fetish to the curriculum could be a ... a real asset .
 Fetish ?
 Yes , there are hundreds of sexual fetishes , actually , and , lo and behold , they often start during puberty .
 Well , you know , covering a person 's face during sex could be anything from a desire to engage in , well , breath play , or even encasement fantasy , or sometimes , although very rare , ghost fetish .


 - Ghost fetish ? - Yeah .
 When one covers another 's face because they secretly have a desire to engage in sexual activity with a spirit or a ghost .
 So my girlfriend 's insane .
 I thought you said it was your friend 's girlfriend ?
 I 've gotta go .
 Fascinating .
 Wow . Who knew ?
 Do you wanna fuck a ghost ?
 What ?
 Well , whatever your face- covering fetish is , you need to sort it out , because it 's weird and it 's scary and it 's just making me feel just very unsafe .
 [ sighs ]
 [ phone ringing ] [ woman ] I 'll get a form for you to fill in .
 See , she 's got a proper problem .
 You 've got a proper problem .
 Pothole on the high street .
 Bloody council .
 Come on , let 's go .
 It 's basically like he sneezed on me or something .
 He came on you , Aimee . Yeah ?
 Yeah .
 Cum is kind of like a penis having a sneeze .
 Ugh ! That means when you swallow someone 's cum , it 's like eating their snot .
 [ woman ] Take a seat , we 'll be with you in a bit .
 - Hi there , how can I help you ?
 - Hi .
 [ clears throat ]
 [ stammers ] This is my friend Aimee .
 She got sexually assaulted on the bus .
 I got jizz on my jeans .
 I mean , we 're probably wasting your time .
 You 're not wasting anyone 's time , all right ?
 Do you need to call somebody ?
 Shit , do I need a lawyer ? Am I gonna get arrested ?
 No , sorry . I just meant , like , your mum or someone .
 Oh , God , no . She 'll just make it into a drama .
 Right . Take a seat , fill out one of these forms , and an officer will be with you in a minute .

 - Thank you .
 - Uh , you forgot your cake .
 Oh . - Is it someone 's birthday ? - Yeah , mine .
 Oh ,
 That means " merry Christmas . "
 - Really ? - Yeah .
 Hmm .
 [ mumbles indistinctly ]
 Men are so weird .
 I think he 's cute .
 Why do people always think old men are cute ?
 How do you know he hasn 't jizzed on someone on a bus before ?
 I meant the lizard .
 What 's going on ?
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 So ... this year 's school production of is not only gonna be a play , but also ... drum roll , please ... [ imitating a drum roll ] [ grunts ] ... a musical , yo !
 [ Colin ]

 Huh ?
 Who 's pumped ? Who 's pumped ? I 'm pumped .
 Yeah ?
 It will be written and assistant- directed by Swing Band 's very own Lily Iglehart , and auditions will be held bright and early tomorrow morning .
 Now , I 've got a really special feeling about this one , guys .
 It 's a chance for everyone to really find their place ... and shine .
 Hey , you forgot your audition speech .
 What is this I see ?
 Jackson Marchetti auditioning for the lowly school play ?
 Will wonders never cease ?
 I don 't really understand Shakespeare , sir , it doesn 't make sense .
 Well , that 's the beauty of will . i . am- bic pentameter .
 Okay , thanks .
 [ Maureen ] Hello .
 Uh , not history .
 Oh , no , I 'm Michael 's wife , Maureen .
 Oh . Sorry . Jean .
 Sex ed- ish .
 Hello .
 It 's Mr. Groff 's dinner . I drop it in on Wednesdays .
 He works late , marking .
 - How are you getting along ? - Good .
 Good , yeah . Think I 'm getting the hang of it .
 Yes .
 Michael used to come home on the verge of tears most nights during his first term as headmaster .
 Oh , don 't tell him I said that .
 Anyway , glad you 're toughing it out .
 Thank you .
 I ... was wondering whether ...
 Yes , what is it ?
 [ nervously chuckles ]
 I was wondering whether ... you could tell me where you got that shade of lipstick from ?
 [ stammers ]
 It 's fabulous .
 [ chuckles ]
 Well , I don 't remember .
 But next time you 're here , why don 't you pop in and I 'll let you know ?
 Great .
 - Well , I better get Mr. Grumpy his food . - Yes .
 It 's nice to meet you , Jean .
 Nice to meet you too , Maureen .
 Do you wanna hang at mine before your date ?
 I can 't . I haven 't decided what I 'm gonna wear . What should I wear ?
 - Wow . How the tables have turned . - Oh , Otis ,
 I don 't have time for this conversation .
 I have to go home and try on everything I own .
 Well , maybe just lose the scarf .
 Maybe lose your virginity ?
 [ gasps ] Olivia , Jesus !
 You could have killed yourself .
 Thanks to your mum , my boyfriend thinks I wanna kill him .
 Why ?
 Because I sometimes do this thing , okay , where I cover his face with a pillow just when I cum and now your mum thinks I have a fetish .
 - Which you don 't ? - I have an ugly cum face , okay ?
 I 've seen it in the mirror before . It 's bad .
 I look like a python swallowing an egg , and Malek always looks perfect .
 Well ... that 's normal to feel observed and vulnerable when you 're having sex .
 And he probably feels just as silly sometimes , too .
 We ... we might think we look stupid or unappealing , but sex isn 't always perfect and it should be about feeling good , not looking pretty .
 It 's a privilege to see your partner like that .
 So maybe you and your boyfriend need to work on your trust , so you can show him yourself fully , like , all the bits .
 Even the bits you think might be ugly ,
 ' cause I bet he doesn 't think they are at all .
 And ... there 's something I think might help .
 I got a B plus in algebra .
 You know that 's not very impressive ?
 - [ blows raspberry ] - So , do you want to do your English or maths homework today ?
 Well ...
 actually , I was thinking of auditioning for the school play , but I don 't understand Shakespeare , and I wondered if you could help me .
 - Not my remit . Maths or English . - Come on .
 Look , I 'd never have got a B plus in algebra if it wasn 't for you .
 And I 'm sure you 've got some Shakespeare tricks up your sleeve ?
 Please .
 You 're not cute .
 [ Jackson chuckles ]
 Why do you wanna audition anyway ?
 Well , I 'm taking your advice and getting a backup plan .
 When I played Joseph in my primary school Nativity , people said I was very believable .
 - Of course you played Joseph . - Come on .
 Please . You 're a tutoring genius .
 Fine .
 - But this is a one- time thing . - Yeah .
 Read me the speech .
 - Now ? - Yeah .
 All right .
 All right .
 " It is my lady , oh , it is my love ,
 - " oh , that she knew she wor ... " - Why are you reading it
 - like it 's a shopping list ? - Because it makes no sense .
 It 's poetry .
 Once you 've got the rhythm , the words take on meaning .
 So , each line has ten syilables , made up of five heartbeats .
 Ba- boom , ba- boom , ba- boom , ba- boom , ba- boom .
 You try .
 [ clears throat ]
 " Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief . "
 So you 've got the rhythm and the words .
 Now you need the emotion .
 This speech is about love .
 So , try thinking of someone who makes you feel a lot when you say it .
 Ooh .
 [ laughs ]
 Hope I get my jeans back .
 Do you really want them back , though ?
 Yeah , they 're the perfect bootleg , Maeve . You don 't find that very often .
 It 's true .
 - Do you think they 're watching us ? - Yeah , probably .
 [ chuckles , farts ]
 - Oh ! - No .
 - Aimee . - I 'm sorry , I 'm really nervous .
 [ knock at door ]
 [ door opens ]
 That wasn 't me .
 Sorry , I fart when I 'm scared .
 Okay .
 All right ...
 Thanks for the jeans , Aimee .
 Where were we ?
 So ... fair hair , clean- shaven , five feet eight or nine ... and a blue jacket .
 It was kind of aqua .
 And was he already on the bus ?
 Yeah .
 I think so .
 He might have got on at the second stop .
 Well , it 's really important to know what stop he got on at so we can get as clear a picture as possible .
 So you said you remember smiling at him .
 Was that after the first stop or the second ?
 Sorry , what 's that got to do with anything ?
 Are you saying she shouldn 't have smiled at him ?
 Charges like this are really hard to convict , and if we do actually catch the guy , the questions are gonna get harder .
 Can I have my jeans back , please ?
 I 'm gonna go . I 'm sorry to make a fuss .
 Aimes , um ... [ clears throat ]
 [ whispers ] ... what if he does this to someone else ? I know you can do this .
 Please ?
 - You 're doing brilliantly , Aimee .
 - [ Maeve ] Yeah .
 Just take your time .
 Try to remember .
 He was already on the bus .
 How was your day at school , Ola ?
 Good .
 How was your day at school , Mum ?
 Having fun hanging out with all my peers ?
 It was very good , thank you .
 [ sniffs ]
 [ groans , chewing loudly ]
 - Dad .
 - Hmm ?
 - Stop . - Oh , sorry .
 I eat like a pig sometimes .
 [ clears throat ]
 I 've been alone for too many years .
 Hmm .
 [ sniffs ]
 My mum 's been single a long time too . She doesn 't eat like that .
 [ Jean ] Otis !
 [ Jakob ]
 Um ... this is delicious .
 Mmm .
 You don 't eat this ?
 Otis doesn 't like fat .
 Oh , really ?
 - Ah , um ...
 - Can I have it , then ?
 Do you have any more ? No .
 Thank you .
 Fat is the best bits .
 Oh .
 It 's bad for your heart .
 Really ? It 's not a proven fact .
 Well , I disagree .
 [ smacking lips ] I 'm okay with that .
 Right .
 Why don 't we all take a deep breath and tell each other exactly how we 're feeling ?
 Let 's start by saying the first words that come into our minds .
 Okay , I 'll start . Annoyed .
 Immature .
 Selfish . Uncomfortable .
 Invasion .
 Overly sensitive . [ Otis ] That 's two words , Mum .
 Monopoly .
 Why don 't we all play Monopoly instead ?
 You guys ready ? Give you a lift .
 Is the lizard going to jail ?
 No , his owner has Alzheimer 's .
 Forgets why he 's here and then he forgets to take this dude home .
 Should we get some dinner , Neil , and then we 'll drop these two on the way ?

 Oh , don 't worry .
 No need for a payment .
 Um , enjoy your stay at my hotel .
 I 'm paying you , it 's just I will have to remortgage .
 No , you don 't have to . I have so much money , I don 't need more .
 Okay , that 's not how the game works .
 I 'm not breaking the rules . Four hundred pounds , please .
 I said it 's fine .
 I said it 's not fine .
 I don 't want it .
 I want you to have it .
 Well , if we 're playing by the rules , you owe me £600 .
 Six hundred .
 Mmm ...
 - I think you 're bankrupt . - Fuck , I know I 'm bankrupt !
 Right , I 'll make some tea .
 [ exclaims in frustration ]
 Why ? Why do we think this is a normal situation ?
 Ola is my girlfriend , you are not my dad , and this is not a fucking family .
 You shouldn 't swear at your mother .
 Thank you , Jakob , but I don 't need help parenting my child .
 [ Jakob ] Okay . I think I should go home .
 Let you guys sort things out .
 [ Jakob sighs ]
 He 's always ... He 's here all the time , and I ...
 I 'll see you at school .
 [ door closes ]
 I want you to go and apologize to Jakob first thing in the morning .
 Sure , I mean , I 'm not gonna have to go anywhere , considering he practically lives here .
 I understand that you 're angry .
 But I 'm happy with Jakob .
 Why can 't you be happy for me ?
 No , you 're pretending to be happy , Mum .
 You 're not the relationship type .
 Stop kidding yourself .
 Or maybe you 're just not as independent as you thought .
 Go to your room !
 I 'm 16 .
 Fine !
 Well , then I 'll go to mine !
 [ door opens , closes ]
 Hey .
 [ chuckles ]
 You found it okay then ?
 Yeah . This town is very small , so , yeah .
 Cool .
 [ chuckles ]
 [ muffled ] Where did you get this cake ?
 Demand your money back .
 Aimee made it .
 Oh , sorry , Aimee . I 'm just not used to some of the flavors .
 Mmm , it 's okay , it 's my first cake .
 I 'm gonna be a baker when I leave school .
 Sounds like a good plan .
 Uh , you having a birthday party ?
 [ scoffs ] No . She hates birthdays .
 [ female officer ] Why ? Birthdays are great .
 Aren 't you doing something nice with your fella ?
 I don 't have a boyfriend .
 She is in love with a boy though .
 She 's just too afraid to tell him how she feels , which is stupid because he clearly loves her back .
 Shut up , Aimee , you don 't know that .
 I think you should tell him how you feel . What have you got to lose ?
 Uh , um , sorry .
 I actually ordered the special , the fishy something ?
 Vichyssoise , it 's a chilled soup .
 Steak 's on the way .
 Cool , great .
 Mmm .
 Mm- hmm .
 Hm- hmm .
 Hm- hmm .
 - How 's your soup ? - Um- hmm .
 It 's cold .
 It 's cold , Rahim .
 [ both laughing ]
 Hmm .
 Have you eaten here before ?
 Um , my mum and dad came here for their wedding anniversary , so ...
 I thought it would be nice .
 Let 's go somewhere else .
 - Where ? - Take me where you feel happy .
 Uh , but ... Well , we haven 't paid . Who cares ?
 You cannot live in fear .
 [ door opens ]
 - [ waitress ]
 Oi !
 - [ Eric ] Huh ? Yes , yeah .
 This is for you , that is from me .
 [ register beeps ]

 So , you just run the scanner over the barcode , like so .
 - [ dog barks ]
 - [ scanner beeps ]
 - Ah .
 - [ dog barks ]
 Jessie 's a rescue .
 - She 's not trained , so don 't let her out . - [ dog whimpers ] She 'll just run off .
 [ scanner beeps ]
 Okay . You show me now .
 [ video game sounds ]
 [ chuckles ]
 No way . I 'm not doing that , I 'm really not .
 No , Rahim , come on , it 'll be fun .
 No , I 'm very bad at dancing . I 'm not doing that .
 Look , you said take you somewhere that makes me feel happy .
 Do it for me ?

 [ Eric ] You ready ?
 Okay .
 Uh ...
 Back , forward , back ...
 [ Eric vocalizes to tune of " What Is Love ? " ]
 [ both laughing ]

 You got this .
 [ both laughing ]

 Ah !
 - You see , you 're basically Beyoncé . - Woo !
 - That was fun . - No , you smashed it .
 Honestly , you smashed it , Rahim , watch ...
 You just kissed me .
 Yes , Eric Effiong , I did .
 Let 's do this dance thing again , all right ?
 Yeah ?
 Give me the money . Thank you .
 [ exclaiming excitedly ]
 It 's a good game . It 's good .
 How is this going to stop you from trying to kill me with a pillow ?
 We have to see each other at our ugliest .
 Do you still wanna have sex with me ?
 Yeah .
 Do you still wanna have sex with me ?
 Definitely .
 [ both laughing ]
 Ahh .
 This is me .
 Do you wanna come in and see where I live ?
 Yes .
 [ both laughing ]
 It 's sexy here , right ? I live above a shop .

 - [ coins jingle on floor ]
 [ door bell rings ]

 When did you get back ?
 None of your business , Tromboner .
 Do you guys know each other ?
 We used to go to school together .
 Um ...
 Do you know what ?
 Um ... it 's a bit late , and I need to get home , sorry .
 Okay . - You can see it another time .
 - Mm- hmm .
 Thank you for a beautiful night .
 [ Eric ]
 Oh , sorry .
 [ Rahim ] Okay .
 [ Eric ] Bye .

 [ Sofia ] Jackson ?
 [ Neil ] Is this where you live ?
 [ Aimee ] Yeah , this is me .
 It 's nice .
 You 'll let me know when I can have my jeans back ?
 [ Neil ] Absolutely . Thanks , Aimee .
 Sorry for ruining your birthday .
 Weirdly , one of the best birthdays I 've had in a long time .
 - All right , bye ! - [ female officer ] Bye .
 - [ Mrs. Gibbs ] Aimee- maimee ! - Night , Mum !
 No , no , how was your day ?
 Come in ! Come in .
 Come in and talk to me .
 Oh , why are you wearing those trousers ?
 They 're not flattering at all .
 ' Cause I lost my jeans .
 How did you lose your jeans ?
 Well , I was on the bus ...
 and actually , I 'm not really sure .
 What about I make you a cheese toastie ? And you can fill me in on all the goss .
 I always like to know who 's kissing who , and ...
 I 'm quite tired .
 Oh .
 What about we watch a movie ?
 You know , something with , um , Ryan Gosling .
 He 's so handsome .
 Or is it Ryan Reynolds ?
 Which Ryan do I like ? Gosling .
 - I think I 'm gonna go to bed .
 - Oh .
 Love you , Mum .
 All right , love .
 [ sobs ]
 [ gags ]
 [ knock at door ]
 Happy birthday .
 What happened to your face ?
 I told him I had other kids . It didn 't go down too well .
 Have .
 You have other kids .
 You 're saving my life , Froggy .
 Yeah , you can come in , but we 're not gonna pretend everything 's okay ,
 ' cause it 's not .
 Got it .
 Come on , darling .
 I came to apologize to your dad .
 Hmm .
 Okay . I 'll go get him .
 - [ Ola ] Dad ...
 - Mm- hmm .
 [ Ola ] He just wants to talk to you .
 [ sniffs ]
 - Hi . - Hi .
 My mum wanted me to come and apologize .
 So , I 'm sorry .
 Well , there 's no need to , but thanks .
 I already have a dad .
 I understand that .
 It 's all right .
 [ Ola ] Hey , you ready for school ?
 Yep . I guess .
 Thank you . You have a good day now .
 - See you , Dad . - Bye- bye .
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 [ driver ] Everything all right ?
 Sorry , wrong bus .
 [ sighs ]
 " Oh , Romeo , Romeo , wherefore art thou Romeo ? "
 Deny thy father and refuse thy name , or if thou will not , be but sworn my love ,
 " and I 'll no longer be a Capulet . "
 Okay . Thank you , Florence .
 I haven 't got to the good bit yet .
 Juliet thinks she 's in love and then she dies . We get the gist .
 Next .
 [ Colin ]
 Ahh !
 Jackson !
 This is gonna be a train wreck .
 [ Colin ] Uh , please ...
 " Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , " who is already sick and pale with grief , that thou , her maid , art far more fair than she .
 Be not her maid , for she is envious ... [ whispers ]
 I think we 've found our Romeo . ... is sick and green .
 And none but fools do wear it .
 " Cast it off . "
 - How was the family dinner ?
 - Oh , God , disastrous .
 How did your date go ?
 We ... kissed .
 - You kissed ? - We kissed , man !
 - Actually ? - How sick is that ?
 - Yes ! We kissed ! - Oh , Eric .
 Can I walk you to lunch ?
 Yes . Yes .
 - Yeah . - Okay .
 Hmm .
 [ sighs ]
 [ clears throat ]
 Hey .
 Hi .
 - Maybe your mum is gonna be a problem . - Yup .
 How was the rest of your birthday ?
 Unexpected .
