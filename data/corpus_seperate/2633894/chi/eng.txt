 00 : 00 : 02, 631 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 915 I don 't know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long . These are great .
 I just started number six .
 That 's a good one .
 Dumbledore dies in that one .
 Yeah , I know , I didn 't see it coming , either .
 Why would you say that ?
 You brought up the subject .
 I contributed an interesting fact on that subject .
 It 's called the art of conversation .
 Okay , your turn .
 That was a huge spoiler .
 Good . What is wrong with you ?
 If I did that , you 'd bitch about it for weeks . Oh , really , Leonard ?
 Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits ?
 Hissy fits ?
 have hissy fits ?
 Yes , and I have a theory why .
 Because of your lactose intolerance , you switched over to soy milk .
 Soy contains estrogen- mimicking compounds .
 I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman .
 You are unbelievable .
 I don 't know why I put up with you .
 You 're controlling , you 're irritating ...
 There you go again -- nag , nag , nag .
 You 're only proving my point , little lady .
 You know what ?
 Screw you , Sheldon .
 You are the most annoying person I have ever met . What ? I 'm annoying ?
 You criticize my behavior all the time .
 " Sheldon , don 't talk about your bowel movements over breakfast . "
 " Sheldon , when the president of the university " is giving a eulogy at a funeral , don 't yawn and point at your watch . "
 " Sheldon , don 't throw away my shirts
 ' cause you think they 're ugly . "
 You 're impossible . That 's it .
 I don 't ...
 I don 't have to put up with this .
 Actually , I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do .
 Aw .
 Here 's what I think of your roommate agreement .
 ( gasps )
 You pick that up right now .
 No .
 Roommate agreement , section 27 , paragraph 5 :
 The roommate agreement , like the American flag , cannot touch the ground .
 I don 't care .
 I don 't have to do anything you say because ...
 I don 't think I want to live here anymore .
 Where are you going ?
 To live with Penny and not you , you crazy bastard .
 Crazy bastard ?
 Yes .
 Leonard , wait . What ?
 Dobby the elf dies in book seven . ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ... Wait ! ♪ ♪ The Earth began to cool ♪ The autotrophs began to drool , Neanderthals developed tools ♪ ♪ We built the Wall ♪ ♪ ♪ Math , Science , History , unraveling the mystery ♪ ♪ That all started with a big bang ♪ ♪ ♪
 Original Air Date on February 7 , 2013 Here you go .
 Great . Come on in .
 What , you don 't say thank you ? It 's my suitcase .
 I lent it to you two years ago . Well , then , I should tell you
 I broke the wheel and the handle .
 So , is everyone from Bernadette 's company going to Vegas ?
 No , just me , her and a couple of the big wigs .
 It 's part of a bonus she got .
 Cool . Did she discover a cure for something ?
 Not exactly .
 They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage .

 Is there a good anal leakage ?
 Anyway , it was Bernie 's idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation .
 ( chuckles )
 Way to make lemonade .
 You know , from around the corner where fudge is made .
 Hey , I got a favor to ask .
 Sure . My mom 's been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her .
 Dumped her ?
 What , did he use a forklift ?
 ( laughing )

 Sorry .
 There 's nothing funny about morbid obesity . She 's huge .
 It was funny . ( laughing )
 Anyway , I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she 's doing okay .
 Dude , I 'm a single man .
 Saturday night is my party night . Really ?
 What do you got going on ? I don 't know , maybe drive down to Hollywood , hit a few hot spots , see if I can get lucky .
 Okay , tell me if this sounds familiar .
 ( clears throat )
 You pay $15 to park , you stand on the sidewalk for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer 20 bucks to let you in .
 You push your way to the bar , where you drink an $18 cosmopolitan , then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together .
 Your children , grandchildren .
 Meanwhile , she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote
 Then you give up on anyone ever loving you , go to Marie Callender 's , buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot .
 What time should I be at your mother 's ?
 I told her around 7 : 00 .
 I swear , that man is the most egotistical , insufferable human being I have ever met .
 Yeah , but you two make such a cute couple .
 Like Burt and Ernie .
 You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers .
 Well , I 've had it . I am done . I can 't ...
 I can 't live with him for one more minute .
 Wow . Where are you going to go ?
 I was thinking here with you .
 Oh .
 That a problem ?
 No , not at all .
 No , it 's- it 's great . It 's terrific . I ...
 You know , I just can 't help feel bad about Sheldon .
 I mean ... how 's he going to get by without you ?
 Ernie .
 He 's got Amy now .
 Yeah , he does , but it 's not the same .
 Why ? Um ...
 Well , um , all right .
 You- you know how in Ron didn 't abandon Harry just because
 Harry started dating Ron 's sister ?
 Harry and Ginny get together ?

 Sorry .
 Spoiler alert .
 My point is , as much as I want to live with you ,
 I can 't do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you .
 Please , the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy , his- his stooge , his doormat .
 Well , you know what they say : if it ain 't broke ...
 Wow .
 It sounds to me like you don 't want us to live together .
 No . No , no , I do . I do .
 It 's just ...
 I mean , it 's a really big step .
 Is it ? We 're together all the time .
 Financially , it makes great sense .
 Can you think of one reason why we shouldn 't do this ? Well ... um ...
 I 'm just a little thirsty .
 Yeah .

 I got nothing .
 Great . I 'll go get my stuff .
 ( laughs nervously ) Yeah .
 Okay , all right , don 't freak out .
 You can make this work . Oh , could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom ?
 I take of medicine .
 Oh , please let some of it be Xanax .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Are you ready for dessert ?
 ( grunts )
 No , thank you , Mrs. Wolowitz . As it is , I 'm going to have to carry my stomach out of here
 like I 'm a fireman rescuing an infant .
 Oh , please .
 You 're a tall glass of brown water .
 Have dessert .
 Well , I- I really couldn 't .
 But , uh , I 've had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you 've had removed from your body over the years .
 Didn 't know you could have a cyst inside another cyst . The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls .
 Well , if you have to go , how about I put a little doggie bag together for you ?
 That would be lovely .
 Thank you .
 ( Mrs. Wolowitz sobbing )
 Mrs. Wolowitz , uh ... are you okay ?
 Don 't mind me .
 I just cry when I 'm lonely and have nothing to live for .
 I , uh ...
 I suppose I could stay for some dessert . Great .
 You like chocolate chip cheesecake ?
 Sure .
 I 'll make one .
 One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure .
 That 's Leonard 's .
 Children 's toy . One
 phaser .
 That 's Leonard 's .
 Children 's toy . One collector 's edition Longclaw sword .
 Oh ...
 Leonard and I bought that together .
 That 's a bit of an ethical conundrum .
 Eh , I 'll keep it .
 So , uh , what 's your plan moving forward ? Uh , suppose I 'll have to find and cultivate a new roommate .

 What a task that will be .
 Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in ?
 No .
 Oh , it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule .
 He would just go whenever the mood struck him .
 Like a dog- boy .
 Exactly .
 What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways ?
 That would be ideal . If a person like that existed ,
 I would sign on , no further questions asked . Great .
 Here I am !

 Wait .
 Here who is where ?
 Me .
 Aren 't I your perfect roommate ? Um ...
 Think about it , Sheldon .
 I 'm not a stranger , we 're intellectually compatible ,
 I 'm willing to chauffeur you around town , and your personality quirks , which others find abhorrent or rage- inducing ,
 I find cute as a button .
 What do you think ?
 Um ... Tell me one reason why this isn 't a fantastic idea .
 Um ...
 See ? You can 't .
 I 'm gonna go see if Leonard 's room is big enough for my water bed .
 Um ...
 Good buddy Leonard .
 Good buddy Leonard .
 Good buddy Leonard .
 What do you want ?
 Hey , good buddy .
 So , uh , I was just talking to Amy , and she made me realize that this little dust- up between you and me is much ado about nothing .
 Is that so ? Yes .
 All is forgiven , so come back home .
 I 'll make you some soy hot chocolate , and then I 'll you tell you about our exciting new devil- may- care bathroom policy .

 Cut to the chase , Sheldon .
 Okay . Amy 's decided she wants to move in with me , so I need you to come back home , you lovable scamp .
 That 's a lot of product .
 Hey . What 's going on ? Oh , get this :
 Suddenly , Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him .
 Really ?
 Interesting . Well , too late , pal .
 I 'm not going anywhere .
 Penny and I are very happy living together .
 Isn 't that right ?
 It 's like the happiness won 't ever leave the apartment .
 Leonard , please . You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn 't ready for .
 Yes !
 That is a real thing .
 And it doesn 't mean you don 't care about each other ; it just means things are moving at a pace you 're not comfortable with , and that 's fine .
 Well , if he doesn 't want to live with her , then he should tell her how he feels .
 Well , maybe he doesn 't know how to say it without hurting her feelings .
 Feelings ?
 What am I , a hippie at a love- in ? No . The problem is , she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn 't refute .

 That is the worst , isn 't it ? Yes .
 I 'm sorry , Sheldon . I can 't help you . Oh , spoiler alert :
 This door 's about to slam in your face .
 Oh , there you are .
 When do I get a key to our apartment ?
 Um ...
 ( phone ringing )



 Hello ?
 Hey .
 How 'd it go last night with my mom ?
 Okay , I guess .
 What time did you leave ?
 ( yawns )
 Actually , I 'm still here .
 What ? You spent the night ?
 Yeah .
 Uh ... after dinner , we watched a rerun of and then she opened a bottle of , uh , cream sherry , and the next thing I know , she was tucking me into your bed .
 You wore my pajamas ?
 Mm- hmm . How do you sleep in these things ?
 Silk pajamas on satin sheets ? I slid out of the bed , like , three times .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Rajesh !
 You up ?
 You ready for breakfast ?
 Oh , boy . Breakfast . Okay , Raj , listen to me .
 You need to get out of there .
 But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes .
 If you don 't leave now , she 'll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life .
 Oh , Howard , stop .
 Trust me , you 're not Jewish .
 That 's how they get you .
 You 're being silly .
 I can leave whenever I want .
 Oh , really ?
 Where are your clothes and your shoes ?
 They 're on the chair , right over ...
 Oy vey .
 Hello , home wrecker .
 What did I do ?
 You gave Leonard somewhere to go . Thanks to you , Amy 's out buying his and hers bath towels .
 Like I 'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it .
 Okay . Listen , the truth is
 I don 't want him living with me .
 Great .
 Kick him out . Break his heart .
 Everybody wins .
 No , I don 't want to break his heart . I love him .
 This is just happening too fast .
 You think this is fast ? It 's just a matter of time before I see Amy 's leg stubble in my shower .

 Yeah , and I 've seen those legs .
 You might want to get some Drano .
 Hold on .
 If you don 't want to live with Leonard , why don 't you just tell him ?
 Well , you know how he is .
 He 's sensitive and emotional .
 That 's because he drinks too much soy milk .
 Well , I don 't know what else we can do but tell them the truth .
 I suppose there 's no choice but to face the crying , angry accusations and the high- pitched wails of despair .
 Yeah .
 And who knows how Amy will react .


 Here 's some more ice .
 Oh , thanks .
 What were we thinking ?
 We should have just done it the regular way .
 Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy .
 Honestly , if I could bend that far , what would I need with you ?
 If you could bend that far , you 'd be doing us both a favor .
 ( phone ringing )

 Hey , Raj . What 's up ?
 You were right !
 I can 't get out of here !
 You 're still at my mother 's ? I 'm trapped .
 My clothes have been in the laundry all day , and she hid my keys .
 I think they might be in her bra , because she jingles when she walks .
 What do I do ?
 Hey , you wanted a woman in your life . Now you got one .
 Come on , Howard , help me .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Rajesh , I ran you a bath .
 Oh , my God . She 's not gonna bathe me , is she ?
 Gee , I wish I could tell you no .

 All right , well , thanks again for helping me out .
 But , Howard ...
 Should we go back and rescue him ?
 It 's too late .
 We 'll see him at his Bar Mitzvah .
 Here you go .
 I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to .
 Is it kung pao chicken ?
 Yes .
 Brown rice , not white rice ?
 Yes .
 Spicy mustard from the Korean deli ?
 Yes . I did good , right ? ( sadly ) :
 Yes .
 Amy , are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship ?
 No . Yeah , why would you ?
 Oh , and , uh , check this out .
 I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us .

 " Hello . This is Sheldon . " " And this is Amy . "
 " We 're not home right now . " " ' Cause we out dropping science , son . " BOTH :

 " Leave a message . "

 Beep .
 ( laughs )
 You can 't live here .
 What ? Why ?
 Is it the message ?
 I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn 't break in .
 No .
 It 's not the message .
 Well , what is it , then ?
 I did everything just the way you like it . You did .
 Then what the hell , Sheldon ? !
 We have been going out for over two years , and I have been nothing but patient with you !
 I watch your dopey space movies .
 I signed your ridiculous contract .
 I even stopped wearing lip gloss ' cause you said it made my mouth look too slippery .
 I am the best girlfriend you 're ever gonna have .
 You give me one good reason why I can 't live here .
 It 's Penny 's fault .
 What ?
 She doesn 't want to live with Leonard , so he has to come live here again .
 She 's the snake in our garden .
 She 's the reason we can 't be happy .
 Hey , Ames . Yeah .
 " Hey , Ames , " nothing .
 I was all set to move in with Sheldon , and now I hear I can 't 'cause you don 't want to live with Leonard .
 LEONARD :
 What ?
 Sheldon , what did you say ?
 I said the truth . You don 't want to live with Leonard , and you know it .
 Since when don 't you want to live with me ?
 Oh , don 't get all huffy .
 You 're the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready .
 Yeah , I think we should talk about that .
 And since you love the truth so much , why don 't you tell Amy you don 't want to live with her instead of blaming it on me ?
 I thought we were talking about the other thing .
 You 're a coward . Well , the evidence does support that .
 Come on , Amy , let 's go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are .
 You know what would show them ?
 I should move in here with you .
 Um ...
 ( door closes )


 Do you want to ... catch up on some
 Okay .
 Have you seen the one where Lori dies ?

 No .
 Or maybe she doesn 't .
 Let 's find out .

 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Where you going ?
 No !
