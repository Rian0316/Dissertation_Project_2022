 00 : 00 : 01, 556 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 391 All right , I 'm ready for my next question .
 In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets , who wins the Second World War ?
 Uganda . Defend .
 Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses .
 A Central African power block is formed , colonizing North Africa and Europe .
 When war breaks out , no one can afford the luxury of a rhino .
 Kenya withers , Uganda triumphs .
 Correct . My turn .
 In a world where a piano is a weapon , not a musical instrument , on what does Scott Joplin play " The Maple Leaf Rag " ?
 Tuned bayonets .
 Defend . Isn 't it obvious ? You 're right .
 My apologies .
 What the hell are you guys playing ?
 It 's a game we invented .
 It 's called Counterfactuals .
 We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other .
 It 's fun for ages eight to 80 . Join us .
 All right . I like a good brainteaser . Give it a whirl .
 You 're in luck ; this is an easy one .
 In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver , what food is no longer consumed ?
 Uh ... a BLT where the " B " stands for beaver ? I don 't know .
 Leonard , be serious . We 're playing a game here .
 I can figure this out .
 Let 's see . Um , well , beavers eat tree bark .
 The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon . So , I 'll say cinnamon .
 Incorrect . Obviously , the answer is cheese Danish .
 What ?
 In a world ruled by a giant beaver , mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord .
 The low- lying city of Copenhagen is flooded .
 Thousands die . Devastated , the Danes never invent their namesake pastry .
 How does one miss that ?
 This is ridiculous . You 're just making stuff up .
 Is he always like this when he loses ?
 Oh , yes . You should 've been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008 .
 You bumped the table and you know it .
 Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities .
 We 'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide .
 I 'm going to my room .
 Very good , Leonard . But next time , don 't tell us where you 're hiding .

 Did you guys see the paper in on supersolids ?
 It 's pretty interesting . This guy 's working from a hypothesis where ...
 Spoiler alert ! Spoiler alert . What ?
 Don 't ruin it for me , man .
 I printed out a PDF to read on the potty .
 On the potty ? What are you , five ?
 It 's a potty . What do you call it ? Toilet .
 That 's a little vulgar for the dinner table , don 't you think ?
 Oh , and " potty " is okay ?
 " Potty " is innocent . " Potty " is adorable .
 What do you do in the potty , wee- wee ?
 If I don 't have to boom- boom .
 Greetings . You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler .
 Nice to see you . Hello .
 Sorry we 're late .
 I must take responsibility . I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies .
 Aha . Okay .
 I believe she 's experiencing her menses .
 Actually , I 'm not .
 In order to avoid surprises , I wear them all the time .
 Aha . Okay .
 " Toilet 's " sounding pretty good now , huh ?
 Hey , look , it 's Shamy .
 Shamy ?
 A juvenile amalgamation of our names .
 Sheldon , Amy -- Shamy .
 Oh . I don 't like that . Don 't do that .
 All righty . What 's new ?
 Well , just recently , I learned that you refer to us as Shamy , and I don 't like that .
 I got it . But what I was going for was , you know , how 's your life ?
 Like everybody else 's .
 Subject to entropy , decay and eventual death .
 Thank you for asking . Why is she not taking our order ?
 I should 've warned you , one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here .
 Really ? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently .
 It 's how they lure you in .
 I believe it 's called " bait and switch . "
 Okay , I 'm just gonna walk away , ' cause ... I don 't want to be here .
 So , this is nice .
 First time we 've all gotten together to eat .
 You 're right , he 's a festival of humdrum chitchat .
 Okay , that 's all I got . Howard , you 're up .
 Um ... tell us about your work , Amy .
 I doubt you 'd understand .
 Sheldon tells me you only have a master 's degree .
 Raj , do you have any questions for Amy ?
 I 'm curious as to why we 're not eating alone .
 They can 't function without me .
 I 'm the social glue that holds this little group together .
 You 're welcome .
 Listen , can I talk to you about your girlfriend ?
 She 's not my girlfriend .
 She 's a girl and she 's my friend , but there 's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva .
 Got it .
 Although , for the record , on one occasion , she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth .
 It 's an action we both regret to this day . Uh- huh .
 Anyway , I 'm not sure she 's the best fit for our little -- how should we call it -- rebel alliance .
 Oh , I never identified with the rebel alliance .
 Despite their tendency to build Death Stars , I 've always been more of an empire man .
 Yeah , not my point .
 I know what your point is . You 're intimidated by Amy 's intellect .
 To that I say , buck up .
 Okay , let me just get right to it .
 Amy is judgmental , sanctimonious and frankly ... just obnoxious .
 So ?
 So we already have you for all that .
 Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy ?
 No , no , of course not . Just have your relationship someplace else .
 May I point out that for eight long months ,
 I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off- key country music caterwauling , the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room , and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore .

 Suffered in silence ?
 Yes .
 And I 'd thank you to do the same .
 Reall -- Silence ? !
 Ah .
 Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water .
 Where are the Rocky Mountains , anyway ?
 Philadelphia .
 Really ? I thought they were out West someplace .
 Think about it , Raj . Where did the movie take place ?
 Philadelphia .
 Okay , now I get it .
 So this is the plan ? From now on , we 're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy ?
 I 'm very comfortable here .
 Penny , dear , why don 't you shoot another silver bullet my way ?
 Get one yourself .
 Ooh , somebody 's been taking bitchy pills .
 God , he 's an ass when he drinks .
 Oh , he 's an ass when he doesn 't . You just don 't hear it .
 Think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years .
 Well , if that 's the case , Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place .
 I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon .
 I did . Well , what 'd he say ?
 Well , he pointed out that he kinda sorta had to ... put up with you .
 Kinda sorta had to ?
 I didn 't agree with him . Well , you defended me , right ?
 I tried , but ... ... he made a fairly well- reasoned argument .
 You 're not doing that right .
 What ? Gimme .
 No .
 Trust me . No !
 I do this for my mom all the time .
 See ?
 With the grain .
 Wow , that is better .
 And someday , when you have varicose veins , I 'll show you how to massage them .
 Oh , God , never again .
 I assume by " never again , " you mean never again will you drink all of Penny 's beer , then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s , a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of
 I was homesick .
 The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills .
 That 's very offensive .
 Yeah , we all thought so .
 Oh , no . What ?
 It 's John and Yoko .
 More like Yoko and Yoko . Greetings .
 Hey .
 I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I 'm doing .
 It 's very impressive , for theoretical work .
 Do I detect a hint of condescension ?
 I 'm sorry , was I being too subtle ?
 I meant compared to the real- world applications of neurobiology , theoretical physics is -- what 's the word I 'm looking for ? -- hmm , cute .
 Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist
 like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke- Maxwell or Dirac ?
 I 'm stating it outright .
 Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke- Maxwell .
 You take that back .
 Absolutely not .
 My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing , which is required for all cognitive reasoning , including scientific inquiry , making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi .
 That means it 's better than his research , and by extension , of course , yours .
 I 'm sorry , I 'm- I 'm still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell , so ...
 Excuse me , but a grand unified theory , insofar as it explains everything , will ipso facto explain neurobiology .
 Yes , but if I 'm successful ,
 I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory , and therefore , subsume your conclusions under my paradigm .
 That 's the rankest psychologism , and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s !
 We appear to have reached an impasse .
 I agree .
 I move our relationship terminate immediately .
 Seconded .
 There being no objections ...
 Uh- uh . ... the motion carries .
 Good day , Amy Farrah Fowler .
 Good day , Sheldon Cooper .
 Women , huh ?
 Can 't live with them , can 't successfully refute their hypotheses .
 Amen to that .
 Hey , Sheldon .
 Hello .
 I hear you broke up with Amy .
 A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend .
 She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend .
 Wow . That 's like the worst country song ever .
 So , how are you doing ?
 Regarding what ?
 Amy .
 I don 't follow .
 Well , breakups -- or whatever the hell this is -- can be tough .
 Penny , I assure you , I 'm fine .
 My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual ,
 There were no emotional bonds , the severing of which would cause me any discomfort .
 The relationship simply outlived its utility , and I 'm continuing on with my life as before .
 Okay . Good .
 Now , if you 'll excuse me , I 'm off to buy a pussycat .
 I gotta tell you guys , I 'm a little worried about Sheldon .
 We 're all a little worried about Sheldon .
 No , I mean since the Shamy hit a reef .
 Oh , I thought you were just making a generalization :
 " You know , I 'm worried about Sheldon
 " someday setting off a low- yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell- O. "
 What does " hit a reef " mean ?
 Uh , went splitsville .
 Pardon ?
 Turned to boom- boom .
 Ah .
 I think Sheldon really misses Amy .
 You should lend him your copy of
 He got a cat to keep him company .
 You 're kidding .
 He takes it everywhere : to bed , to the bathroom .
 He takes the kitty to the potty ?
 I thought we discussed the P- word .
 Don 't try to change me , dude . I am what I am .
 Oh , gentlemen .
 Aren 't you going to introduce us to your little friend ?
 Hey .
 My apologies .
 Raj , Howard , I 'd like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer .
 Hello . Hi .
 Now , if you 'll excuse me , the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk .
 Okay , I get it . We 're worried about Sheldon .
 Yeah .
 Hey .
 Oh , no . Robert Oppenheimer was lonely .
 So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project ? but he 's so zazzy .



 Okay , we need to talk .
 About what ?
 Cats , Sheldon .
 You 're clearly upset about Amy being gone , and you 're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats .
 Clowder . What ?
 A group of cats is a clowder .
 Or a glaring .
 Okay , yeah , fine . It 's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one .
 Terrific .
 My point is , you need to face up to what you 're feeling with this breakup .
 It wasn 't a breakup .
 A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend .
 Okay , I got it , I got it ; she 's not your girlfriend .
 Now listen to me .
 I know about loneliness .
 I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff .
 When I broke up with Penny , I got back into my cello , I built a bunch of model rockets ,
 I got those weightlifting gloves and that five- pound dumbbell .
 You didn 't break up , she dumped you .
 She didn 't dump me .
 It was mutual !
 I was there . She dumped you .
 Okay , fine .
 Live with cats . Be like my Aunt Nancy .
 She had dozens of them .
 And do you know what happened after she died ? They ate her .
 You don 't have to sell me on cats , Leonard . I 'm already a fan .
 All right , fellas , who 's in the mood for Fancy Feast ?
 Well , that 's not fancy at all .
 Hi , Mrs. Cooper . Thanks for coming .
 Where is he ? He 's in his bedroom .
 Now , when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl , you meant an actual girl , not something you kids whipped up in a lab ?
 No , she 's real .
 Did they sin ?
 No , no , it 's not like that .
 It 's , uh ...
 I don 't know what it 's like .
 But there is something I should prepare you for .
 Oh , relax , Leonard , I have raised that boy .
 I 've seen him at his best , I 've seen him at his worst .
 There 's nothing he can do that 'll surprise me .
 Hold on to that thought .
 Come in .
 Surprise .
 Mom , what an unexpected pleasure .
 My , my , that 's a powerful smell .
 I 'd like you to meet Oppenheimer , Frisch , Panofsky , Feynman , Weisskopf ...
 Yeah , I get it . You got a lot of cats and you gave 'em cute Jewish names .
 What are you doing here ?
 Leonard called .
 And he said that you were pining for a young lady .
 Oh , that 's preposterous .
 I 'm not pining over anyone .
 Oh , lambchop , we can quibble what to call it , but I think we can both agree it 's creepy .
 I do not agree .
 Cats make wonderful companions .
 They don 't argue or question my intellectual authority , and this little guy here ,
 I think you 'll find to be quite zazzy .
 You should have called sooner .
 Shelly ! Dinner 's ready !
 Coming !
 No cats ! Aw ...
 What is she doing here ?
 I called her .
 Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me .
 As a neurobiologist , I was curious .
 Well , rest assured , I am in full possession of my faculties .
 25 cats !
 Oh , God bless you , dear .
 Sheldon , sit down . Let 's talk .
 All right , but you 're not fooling me .
 Whenever you say we have to talk , it means you want me to listen .
 Then stop talking . Yes , ma 'am .
 Now , the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is .
 And after chatting a bit , I have to say that while she is a unique young woman , you two are definitely not suited for each other .
 That 's a peculiar conclusion .
 By any standard , Amy is more similar to me than anyone I 've ever met .
 Oh , I 'm sorry , Shelly , I can 't see it .
 Well , whether you see it or not is irrelevant .
 I can 't see subatomic particles , but nevertheless , they 're there .
 Excellent point .
 A physics point .
 Touché .
 Well , putting aside the pig Latin , it 's a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn 't have to end it for you .
 Amy , after consideration , I believe we may have acted rashly .
 I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences .
 I 'll agree to that only if you 'll stipulate that 80 % of our difficulties were caused by you .
 I 'll go as high as 40 .
 Sixty- five . Done .
 You understand that moving forward , we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you ?
 I do .
 I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating .
 Would you like to see my cats ?
 I would . I love cats . They 're the epitome of indifference .
 Ah , then you may find Zazzles a little cloying .
 I saw what you did there .
 He thinks he 's such a smarty pants . He 's no different from any man .
 You tell 'em not to do something , that 's all they want to do .
 If I hadn 't told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand , we 'd still be calling him Edward .
 Now , don 't you move .
 I 'll bring over all the food .
 No , no , no , I can do it .
 Well , isn 't that sweet ?
 Thank you , Amy .
 Here 's your cat .
 And here 's your $20 . Next !
 Thank you , Amy .
 Here 's your cat .
 And here 's your $20 .
