 Are you chewing gum ?
 You never chew gum .
 You shouldn 't chew gum in here .
 Nobody cares if I chew gum , ted .
 Are you chewing gum ?
 Yes , she is . She 's chewing gum .
 Ooh , can I have a piece ?
 Of course ! Great .
 Thank you .
 Okay , let 's chew some gum
 And get you guys all checked in .
 Ms. Aldrin , how many keys will you need ?
 Two , please .
 My husband 's getting in later .
 Excellent , and mr . Mosby ?
 Uh , just one , please .
 Oh , oh , I- I see .
 Oh .
 Well , hang in there .
 You 'll find somebody .
 Thank you , front desk stranger .
 I 'm sorry , we just ... We just don 't get a lot of singles here .
 I mean , look at this place .
 It 's so romantic .
 Countless babies conceived within these walls .
 And one ... Grisly murder .
 Now , are you sure that you wouldn 't
 Feel more comfortable staying at a motel ?
 What ? No , look .
 I 'm not some miserable , lonely person .
 Tell him , lily .
 It 's a tough weekend for him .
 Bro .
 We 're here for a wedding .
 Ouch . And he used to date the bride . Ooh , mama .
 And he 's the best man . Devastating .
 Could you please just check us in ?
 Oh , your rooms aren 't gonna be ready for hours .
 But in the meantime ,
 Ms. Aldrin , I definitely think
 You and your husband should check out the lighthouse .
 It 's a beautiful view of the bay -- so romantic .
 Oh , wow . Here 's the channel guide
 For the tv .
 Don 't listen to him , ted .
 ( phone ringing ) you are not alone .
 In fact , this whole weekend ,
 It is going to be nothing but me and ...
 Marshall !
 Oh , thank god , you 're on your way .
 If I had to be here alone , I would kill myself .

 Marshall missed his flight .
 He might not get here tonight .
 He might not get here at all .
 We ...
 Only have a few of these left .
 Hi ...
 Linus . Here 's how this goes down .
 If I 'm going to make it through this weekend without my husband ,
 I need you to hook a lady up .
 Any time you see me without a drink in my hand ,
 You put a drink in my hand .
 Are you my guy , linus ?
 So you want the kennedy package ?
 Bingo .
 ( phone rings ) go for barney .
 Ah . Thank you linus .
 Barney , before you get too upset ,
 There 's another flight that leaves in five minutes .
 You 're getting on it .
 I 'm gonna try . There is no try !
 You 're getting on that plane .
 Hey , growth spurt .
 If there is only one seat left on this plane ,
 I will fight you for it .
 And I 'm a biter .
 Marshall , whoever that is , grab her carry- on
 And throw it into a restricted area .
 I 'm serious . Do it .
 Do it now . What ?
 No .
 Barney , are you ... ? No , I 'm not gonna ...
 That 's ...
 No . There is no " what , no , barney , are you ,
 No I 'm not gonna , that 's no ! "
 This is a holiday weekend .
 You 're not gonna get to new york by being nice .
 So you 're gonna have to lose the whole midwestern
 Aw- shucksy- doodles thing ...
 Shucksy doodles ? ... And act like a new yorker .
 A pushy , obnoxious , knock- the- other- guy- down -
 And- take- his- hot- dog resident of the greatest city on earth !
 No can do , barney .
 I 'm from minnesota ,
 Where there 's plenty of hot dogs for everyone .
 Perhaps even too many .
 But listen , I 'm gonna get to new york
 Without being a jerk .
 Just get to new york !
 I 'll get to new york ! Nobody 's getting to new york .
 Not this weekend anyway .
 There 's a big storm rolling up the east coast .
 All the airports are closing .
 My advice is rent a car and drive .
 But you better hurry . They 're gonna run out of cars soon . ( groans )
 Okay , listen .
 If we 're both going to new york ,
 Why don 't we rent a car , split the drive ?
 That seems like a reasonable plan .
 Can I help you with that diaper bag ?
 Sure . Thank you .
 Oh , it 's ...
 Have a nice bus ride , pumpkin head !
 ( panting )
 Hey , lady .
 Yeah , you just threw away your ticket
 To a really great road trip .
 I 'm sorry , I can 't hear you .
 You 're all the way back there ,
 And I 'm all the way up here .
 ( laughing ) oh , you can hear me .
 Get ready to be driving the jealous- mobile
 Because our car is gonna have games ,
 Snacks , a james patterson audio book
 My mother describes as " cluttering her glove box . "
 Your car ? I 'll be in pittsburgh before you get your car .
 We 'll see about that .
 And if you 're going to new york , you 're not gonna want
 To go through pittsburgh . 94 backs up around allentown ,
 So you 're gonna want to stick on 80 .
 Jerk face !
 Come on , universe .
 I 'm a nice guy .
 Send me a miracle .
 Narrator :

 Okay , people , let 's move it along .
 What do you want ? You want a car ? You got a car .
 Beat it . What kind of car do you want ?
 Too slow , you get a minivan .
 Next . Ah , midsize sedan .
 Incoming .
 Next . Yes ! You want a gas option ?
 Nobody wants a gas option .
 Get out of here .
 Next . Hello . I need a car .
 You 've got it . That 's all of them .
 We 're all out of cars , everybody .
 Wait , no !
 You let this guy beat you ?
 Ma 'am , it 's not a race .
 That right there is why you lost .
 Maybe this is your fault .
 Did you ever think of that ?
 Maybe if you had just been
 A little bit nicer , then you would be
 The one driving this lovely ...
 What kind of car is it ?
 Narrator :


 2006 monstrosity . ¶ monstrosity ¶ 'cause global warming 's not real . ¶

 Oh , no , not a monstrosity .
 I 'll take it . I can 't drive that .
 I can . Give me the monstrosity .
 Do you have anything else ?
 I 'll take the monstrosity . There 's nothing else .
 Give me the keys , old man ! It 's just so freaking huge !
 Well , actually it 's a monstrosity sport ,
 So it 's a little smaller . ¶ monstrosity sport ¶ it 's still freaking huge .

 Fine .
 I 'll take it . But I 'm also gonna need a baby seat .
 We 're all out of baby seats .
 Get out of here . Oh , my god -- what am I gonna do ?
 I don 't care .
 ( groans ) Can I make a suggestion ?
 I rent the car ,
 Then I go buy the car seat , come back here ,
 Pick you guys up , and then the three of us
 Drive to new york together .
 ( laughs quietly )
 Let me get this straight .
 So , you 're gonna rent the car ,
 Go and get a baby seat for my son ,
 And then drive all the way back here to pick me up .
 That 's right .
 Well , then you 're gonna need some cash . Here .
 Hundred bucks ought to cover it .
 So , we 'll see you soon .
 You got it , michael ! Marshall .
 Doesn 't matter now , does it ?
 Remember this day , marvin .
 Not only is this the day that we either saw prince
 Or a ... A really flamboyantly dressed greyhound ,
 It 's also the day that your dad chose not to be a jerk ...
 And put his trust in humanity .
 Just watch where it gets us .
 Shucksy- doodles !
 Narrator :

 But let 's back up a little bit .
 And now the true tale of the stinson curse .
 Barney :
 ( russian accent ) : What a wonderful night at the opera .
 Wouldn 't you agree , comrade barnovski ?
 ( russian accent ) : I would indeed , comrade jamesokoff .
 But you know what made it truly wonderful ?
 Being here with my wife ...
 The beet in my borscht , the fur on my hat ,
 The only person I 've ever been attracted to , ever .
 I feel the same way about kyle ...
 My plutonic friend from work . ( clattering )
 Is it just me , or did that feel like we hit an old gypsy woman ?
 Yep . Old gypsy woman .
 Good call , barnovski . Oh , well , she 's just a peasant .
 Home , smirnoff .
 Wait , she 's saying somethink ! ( low , deep moan )
 Hornier .
 Hornier .
 Hornier ?
 Sonobovich !
 Did she just put a curse on us ?
 Eh , nonsense , brother .
 Okay , let 's go , smirnoff .
 Smirnoff ?
 Homina , hominovich .
 Mmm , Smirnoff , I would climb you like the kremlin wall .
 What 's happening to me ?
 Don 't you see ? You 're getting hornier , brother ,
 Just like the old gypsy woman said !
 Oh , hello there .
 ( chuckles ) ever had a white russian ?
 Barney :




 That is , until my brother james
 Met his husband tom .
 The day they got married , they lifted the curse forever ,
 Freeing me from the shackles
 Of having sex with lots of different women .
 Although , sometimes
 Robin and I still use the shackles .
 Bondage five !
 Whoa . I can 't , I can 't ,
 I can 't .
 ( phone rings ) go for barney ! Ah .
 Thank you , linus .
 This is worse than I thought .
 I know . Showtime , no hbo ?
 James : No .
 Tom and I are getting divorced .
 What ? Ted :
 What ? That 's why you look extra handsome .
 I do get extra hot when I 'm single .
 Your skin looks amazing .
 Looks amazing .
 I know . So ... So what happened ?
 Why- why 'd you guys break up ? Well , the thing to remember
 Is that when something like this happens ,
 It 's nobody 's fault .
 You cheated on him . Repeatedly .
 I thought about keeping it quiet ,
 But then I realized , wouldn 't my family want me
 To be honest with them about news this big ?
 Oh , can I just say five things ?
 What is the matter with -- sorry , six -- you ? !
 Ooh ! What ? !
 I 'm- I 'm sorry about you and tom ,
 But you can 't just drop a bombshell like this
 So close to someone 's wedding .
 You broke the curse . You and tom
 Are the only couple
 That makes barney believe in marriage .
 ( chuckles ) really ? The only couple ?
 I mean , no one else comes to mind ?
 Been together 17 years ?
 She 's a spunky redhead , he 's got calves
 That launched a thousand lady boners ?
 Barney : Hey , sorry about that .
 Hey , did you guys know
 That Sunday is james ' and tom 's anniversary ?
 How cool is that ?
 We 're anniversary bros !
 Every year , we should go out and celebrate ...
 Just the two of us .
 Listen , bro , you ...
 I know , I know , " please , barney ,
 You don 't have to get us an anniversary gift this year . "
 You get them an anniversary gift ?
 Why shouldn 't I ? They 're the one couple
 That makes me believe marriage is possible .
 I mean , I 'm sitting right here .
 Thank you , linus .
 James : Barney , the thing is ...
 Cover your ears and hum " the battle hymn of the republic . "
 Why ?
 It 's for the bride .
 Oh , it 's for ... ( humming )
 Okay , listen , james ,
 My cousin vince is a mountie .
 His girlfriend is back home , but he gets gay at weddings .
 He 's yours . I am giving you vince .
 Just please , don 't tell barney .
 If he finds out that the only
 Successful marriage in his life is over ...
 I hate everyone at this table . ... It 'll spook him .
 I don 't want him getting spooked .
 Robin , have some faith .
 Do you really think what you and barney have is that fragile ?
 I don 't want to find out .
 Fine .
 Thanks , baby .
 No sweat .
 Mmm ... So , james , seriously , where 's tom ?
 He can 't make the wedding .
 He had his wisdom teeth out .
 Ugh ! On top of a divorce ?
 That is rough .
 Uh- oh .
 What is she talking about ?
 Tom and I are getting a divorce .
 Excuse me .
 Vince ... Off the table .
 What was that ?
 I don 't know .
 It just came out . That 's it . It 's barely even noon .
 You 're cut off .
 Thank you , linus .
 Thank you , linus .
 Thank you , linus .
 Thank you , linus .
 Thank you , linus .
 Okay , but after that one , you 're cut off !
 No ! No , you are not doing this . Step away from the desk .
 What are you talking about ?
 You just found out about james and tom ,
 And it totally freaked you out , and now you 're asking this guy
 To point you in the direction
 Of the nearest , dirtiest strip club .
 Oh , well , that- that 's a tough one .
 Uh , the nearest one that 's- that 's kind of dirty
 Is the sand box ,
 But the , uh ... The dirtiest one that 's nearby
 Is the crab shed .
 Dude .
 Sorry . Uh , but hey , if- if you do go ,
 Maybe you could take ted .
 I 'm really worried about that kid .
 No , robin , I am not going to a strip club .
 Especially right now .
 Could you imagine the day shift at the crab shed ?
 Robin ...
 I came to the desk to get this .
 Is that the key to our room ?
 It 's the key to james 's room .
 Oh , my .
 What is that ?
 It 's an erotic cake .
 I wanted to surprise them for their anniversary .
 Is that ...
 Is that james and tom ? Mmm , caramel marzipan , chocolate marzipan .
 I love chocolate marzipan .
 So does tom . Used to anyway .
 This is , uh , absolutely the , uh ... The weirdest thing
 Anyone has ever done for their sibling .
 I love you so much .
 You thought I was gonna freak out .
 Well , I mean , a gypsy cursed your family
 To become hornier and do awesome guitar solos .
 Can you blame me ?
 Look , am I bummed about james and tom getting a divorce ?
 Obviously . But I don 't need them
 To make me believe in true love anymore .
 I 've got you for that now .
 Mmm .
 Oh , man , now I gotta figure out what to do with all this stuff .
 Well , before we do that ...
 Um , would it be all right if I nibbled
 On your brother 's ding dong ?
 How about we nibble
 On my brother 's ding dong together ?
 I 'd like that .
 Narrator : So , they cleaned all that stuff



 Just so we 're clear , I pick the music .
 Of course .
 Say it .
 Say , " daphne picks the music . "
 Daphne picks the music .
 And you pay for gas .
 Are you kidding ?
 Do you have any idea How much gas this thing takes ?
 ( engine revs ) no , no , okay !
 Okay , I pay for gas .
 Good . Now , get in .
 It 's a long ride to phoenix .
 Say what ?
 ( laughs ) I 'm just kidding .
 Oh , this is gonna be fun .
 This must be the singles table .
 ( chuckles ) guess it is .
 Well , it 's kind of nice to be asking this question
 Instead of answering it for a change :
 How are you doing ?
 I don 't know .
 I 'm trying to be happy for my brother ,
 But , uh ... I guess a person
 Has a different perspective on weddings
 When he knows what 's down there at the end of the aisle .
 It 's not all champagne and frosting .
 Mr. Stinson , your room is ready .
 And , ted ...
 She 's right around the corner .
 Thank you , curtis .
 I feel it , too .
 No , no , no , the- the housekeeper .
 She 's in the room that 's right around the corner from yours .
 Oh .
 So another hour , tops . Sure .
 Okay , see you later , ted .
 You 're not giving up , james .
 And neither am I. ( footsteps approach )
 Ted :
 Hey , beautiful . Hi .
 God , you look great .
 What ? Come on .
 You do !
 I 've been in a car all morning .
 I just ate a croissant crumb that I found in my bra .
 I 'm disgusting .
 Yeah , I saw you do that . And it was super hot .
 Come here . ( chuckles ) you come here .
 Come here . No , you come here . Come here .
 Hey , you want to hear something funny ?
 Mm- hmm .
 One year ago today , almost to the minute ,
 I was sitting at this very table
 Right in that seat .
 Oh , yeah . I can see it .
 Nursing your gin and tonic with three extra limes ,
 Doing the crossword ,
 Probably being all showboat- y about it .
 I wasn 't being showboat- y about it . " vesuvius . " boo- yah !
 Oh , wait , that doesn 't fit .
 The point is , one year ago today ,
 I made a promise to myself right at this table .
 The mother : What was the promise ?
 Both teds : I 'm coming back , and I 'm bringing you .
 Wait a second .
 Hold it . One year ago today , you hadn 't even met me .
 I know , but I knew I would .
 And now it 's a year later .
 And here I am .
 Here you are .
 Love in your eyes ,
 Baked goods in your undergarments .
 Yeah .
 You picked a real winner , mosby .
 I did .
 Okay , seriously , what the crap
 Is taking so long with these rooms ?
 It was like this last year .
 I 'll be right back .
 I 'll be right here .
 Sorry that took so long .
 Please ...
 Try to enjoy your stay .
 I will .
 Try to .
 I will enjoy my stay .
 Try .
 Not gonna try .
 Just ... Just gonna do it .
 Good for you .
 Not good for me .
 No , just- just neutral for me .
 Attaboy . No , at not a boy .
 It gets better .
 I am fine , curtis . Okay ?
 I enjoy and appreciate the happiness of other people
 Whether I am in a relationship or not .
 Okay ? Curtis ?
 So just- just ...
 Just go ahead and give me my one key
 Because I am fine .
 Oh , come on !
 I need another drink . Captioned by
