 00 : 00 : 04, 130 -- > 00 : 00 : 07, 080 Hey , do me a favor and take table seven .
 You mean the one with my 118- pound rock- hard stud of a fiancé who 's prone to canker sores and pinkeye ?
 Nah , I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex- boyfriend and his gorgeous , successful and sophisticated girlfriend , who makes me feel like a toothless Okie .
 Do you want me to spill hot soup on her ?
 Oh , please -- you 're not that kind of person .
 I know .
 But if she orders something low- fat
 I 'll totally give her the full- fat version .
 Uh , that 's my water .
 What ?
 My water . You 're drinking it .
 D- Dear Lord !
 Have you been drinking it ? Yes .
 It 's my water .
 Well , that 's it then .
 I 'm dead .
 Here we go ... I 'm sorry , do I really need to connect the dots for you ?
 The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home , sweet home .
 Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend .
 Hey !
 That 's my sister and my country you 're talking about .
 Leonard may have defiled one , but I won 't have you talking smack about the other .
 You guys ready to order ?
 Yes , I 'd like a seven- day course of penicillin , some , uh , syrup of ipecac -- to induce vomiting -- and a mint .
 I don 't understand .
 He drank from Leonard 's glass .
 " He drank from Leonard 's glass " -- the words they 'll be carving into my tombstone .
 That 's actually my napkin .
 Oh , this is a nightmare !
 Where are you going ?
 To the bar , to sterilize my mouth with alcohol .
 Gang way ! Dead man walking !

 All right . Here you go .
 Two lemonades , one iced tea and a root beer for Priya .
 - Is it diet ?
 - That 's what you ordered .
 Thank you .
 Hey , have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet ?
 Yeah .
 We 're thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean .
 Nothing soothes those pre- wedding jitters
 like the thought of falling and drowning .
 What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married ?
 He hasn 't told her yet .
 He 's waiting for the right time .
 I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy .
 Howard , you 've got to tell your mother .
 Hey , have you told your parents you 're dating this short glass of skim milk here ?
 Uh ... that 's different .
 First of all , we 're not engaged ; and second , Indian parents are very protective of their children .
 Right , right , whereas Jewish mothers take a casual , la- di- da approach to their sons .
 I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit .
 - You all right ? - Fine .
 Thank you for asking .
 I love you so much .
 Fire demon .
 Ooh , fire demon .
 Sheldon 's turning up the heat ...
 Troll master .
 Howard pulls one out from under the bridge .
 Check it !
 Nice !
 Water nymph .
 Oh , yeah , she 's got puddles in all the right places .
 Could you please play the game without commenting on every card ?
 Sorry .
 Walking tree .
 Last one .
 I 'm taking a stroll and I 'm sporting wood .
 Okay , the has landed .
 What 's going on ?
 Bernadette and my mother are having a get- to- know- you lunch at the Old Town Deli .
 Oh , that sounds lovely .
 Hope so .
 Of course , if history is any indication , my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl .
 Have you met Bernadette 's parents ?
 You mean Adolf and Eva ?

 Not yet .
 One goose step at a time .
 Sheldon , that 's my water .
 Oh , dear Lord !
 That 's not your water .
 I know .
 Where 's the mouthwash ? !
 " Where " indeed .
 Ma , I 'm home !
 Where are you ?
 I 'm in the toilet !
 So , how 'd it go ? !
 Too soon to say !
 I 'm not done yet !
 No , I mean lunch , today , with Bernadette !
 Oh ! I had a pastrami sandwich .
 She had eggplant lasagna .
 Like that 's what a person orders in a Jewish deli .
 Besides food , did you get along ?
 Did you talk ?
 Oh , sure !
 Did you know she 's going to school to become a microbiologist ? !
 No , she never mentioned it .
 I bet she did and you didn 't listen !
 Yeah , that 's probably it . So , what do you think ?
 Do you like her ? She 's great , huh ?
 She 's a lovely girl !
 Cute as a button !
 That 's good to hear , ' cause I 've got some news .
 I hope it 's good news , because I 've got nothing but disappointment in here !
 Bernadette and I are getting married .
 Ma ?
 You too busy bearing down ?
 Ma ?
 Oh , my God , Ma ? Ma ? Ma ?
 Stand back , I 'm gonna break the door down !
 Son of a bitch ! Ma , help !
 Hey .
 Hello .
 Haven 't seen you in a while .
 How 's it going ?
 Oh , other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system -- hunky- dory .

 Did I say something amusing ?
 I don 't know , maybe , I have no idea what you said .
 So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all ?
 My mirth . Classic .
 Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought ?
 It 's not a big deal , Sheldon .
 It 's just , ever since Leonard 's been dating Raj 's sister , I 've had to keep my distance .
 I don 't get to hear all your jibber- jabber .
 Jibber- jabber ? !
 I don 't jibber- jabber .
 What are you doing at work these days ?
 Oh , I 'm working on time- dependent backgrounds in string theory , specifically quantum field theory in " d- dimensional " de Sitter space .

 Okay , come on , even you have to admit that 's jibber- jabber .
 Interesting , do you know where the phrase " jibber- jabber " comes from ?
 Oh , my God , you 're about to jibber- jabber about jibber- jabber .
 Howard and his mother are at the hospital .
 - Come on , we gotta go . - Oh , my God !
 What happened ? I don 't know , I just got a text . Come on , hurry .
 Okay .
 Sheldon , let 's go !
 To a hospital ? !
 Full of sick people ? !
 Oh , I don 't think so .
 Okay , well , your friend and his mother are there , we 're going .
 I can 't .
 Oh , don 't tell me you 're afraid of germs .
 Not all germs .
 Just the ones that will kill me .
 It 's the same way I 'm not afraid of all steak knives -- just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax .
 Fine , I 'll tell Howard you didn 't come because you 're more concerned about your own well- being than his .
 I would think he would know that .
 Okay , you know what ? You are unbelievable .
 You buy all these superhero T- shirts , but when it 's time for you to step up and do the right thing , you just hide in the laundry room .

 Fine , I 'll go .
 Just for the record , my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital .
 She went in to visit my Uncle Roger , caught something and bit the dust a week later .
 The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother 's mantel .
 So I knocked down the bathroom door , picked up my poor unconscious mother , carried her to the car , and drove like a madman to the emergency room .

 You 're a real hero , Howard .
 No , I did what any son would do .
 Hang on a second -- you picked up your mother ?
 Her own legs are barely able to do that .
 I was filled with adrenaline .
 It happens to be how women lift cars off babies .
 Yeah , I 'm saying , it 'd be easier to lift a car .
 What can I tell you ?
 After I found the courage to put her pants back on , I was unstoppable .
 So , how is she ?
 They 're running tests -- I don 't know .
 It may have been a heart attack or heart- attack- like event .
 What 's the difference ?
 A heart- attack- like event is an event that 's like a heart attack .
 Thanks for clearing that up .
 Regardless , coronary problems are eminently treatable .
 What 's more likely going to kill Howard 's mother are the antibiotic- resistant super- bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital .
 Okay , you 're not helping .
 Disagree .
 Go sit over there .
 I 'll sit over there -- it looks cleaner .
 Is there a history of heart disease in your family ?
 My family is the history of heart disease .
 There 's a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this :
 So it 's probably genetic .
 Well , maybe .
 Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her . What ?
 It 's not important .
 Come on , Howard , I 'm going to be your wife .
 You can share anything with me .
 You 'd think that . But no .
 You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack ?
 You can 't take that personally .
 How else is she supposed to take it ?
 What you 've got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left ,
 I 've been the whole world to my mother .
 I mean , she 'd be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can 't .
 You mean sexual intercourse ?
 Well , when you say it like that you make it sound creepy .
 What happened ?
 Howard 's mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can 't .
 Bernie , wait !
 I 'll give you $1, 000 if you 'll drive me home .
 Nice of you to come for Howard .
 Well , he 's my friend . It 's what you do .
 I 'm sorry , did I miss something ?
 It 's just so weird .
 Howard Wolowitz is my friend .
 You know , once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose .
 That 's a little easier to believe than he 's your friend .
 Yeah , tell me about it .
 You know , my brother had a group of friends like this in India .
 They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers .
 You mean when he was little .
 Not as little as you 'd want him to be .
 You know , this stuff is horrible .
 You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee ?
 Sure .
 We 're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee . You want anything ?
 I 'm fine .
 That 's nice that they 're getting along .
 Your girlfriend and your ex- girlfriend are hanging out together ?
 Oh , yeah , that can only be good for you .
 What are you talking about ?
 One of them broke up with you .
 Do you really want her telling the other one why ?
 I don 't care .
 I don 't have anything to hide .
 Good , good .
 Then you have nothing to worry about .
 No , I do not .
 You are a mean little man .
 You 'd think it 'd be because my parents didn 't love me , but actually they loved me a great deal .
 Bernie , it 's not you .
 She 's just set in her ways .
 How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother ?
 It 's the circle of life , sweetie .
 One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you .
 Howard , I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home .
 What 's wrong with the bathroom here ?
 Pneumococcus , streptococcus , staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses .
 Sheldon , my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancée is grief- stricken over putting her there .
 I 'm not taking you home .
 Will you at least go with me to the restroom here , so you can open the door and flush the urinal ?
 No !
 This might be a good time to point out , Howard , that friendship requires a certain give and take .
 Hold the door .
 Mr. Wolowitz ? - Is she okay ?
 - It wasn 't a heart attack .
 She 's awake , she 's resting comfortably -- we 're still running a few tests .
 Can I see her ?
 Actually , she said , and I quote , she 'd " like to see the little Catholic girl first . "
 Me ?
 Why me ?
 Jews have been asking that for centuries .
 There 's no real good answer .
 Okay , well , wish me luck .
 Don 't worry , you 'll be fine .
 Let 's just hide Mr. Cross .
 If it touches her , it burns .
 You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother ? Yeah .
 Why don 't I write you a prescription for Xanax .
 Finally .


 Oh , what fresh hell is this ?
 Wait , you can 't leave here , you 've been exposed .
 No , I haven 't .
 It 's all good .
 You want to talk about crazy mothers ,
 Leonard 's mom wouldn 't give him any sort of approval growing up .
 Oh , the poor thing .
 It makes him desperate to please women .
 That 's why the foreplay goes on and on .
 It does , doesn 't it ?
 It 's like he 's trying to win a prize .
 A word of advice -- don 't doze off .
 You will never hear the end of it .
 Help me !
 Come back !
 Penny !
 There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly , but ...
 Like what ?
 Every once in a while , before we 'd go to bed ,
 I 'd put on a little show for her .
 What do you mean " a show " ?
 Well , you know , the way I took my clothes off .
 Like , to music ?
 I 'd look pretty stupid if there was no music .
 So you 'd do a striptease ?
 I wasn 't swinging around a pole .
 Good , good .
 There was one time I put body glitter on .
 Well , I don 't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that .
 No , she wouldn 't .
 Your big problem is me telling her .
 You really are a mean little man .
 Oh , God , that 's so true .
 I know , right ?
 Hey , what took you guys so long ?
 Oh , we were just chatting . That 's nice .
 What about ?
 We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack .
 That 's funny . Yeah .
 What if she wasn 't kidding ? It doesn 't matter .
 I 'm the king of foreplay .
 Hey , how 'd it go ?
 You 're a putz .
 You know what that means ? Yeah .
 Do you ?
 Your mother just taught it to me .
 She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay .
 And are you ?
 No , because I 'm engaged to a putz .
 You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack .
 Well , based on the available evid --
 Shut up !
 She said I 'm a wonderful girl and that you 're lucky to have me .
 Where are you going ?
 To the toilet !
 Is that okay with you ? !
 Is it just me , or does she sound sexy when she 's angry ?
 Mountain Elf .
 He takes the elf from off the shelf .
 Hell Hounds .
 Hell Hounds -- who let the Satanic dogs out ? Who ?
 Who- who ?
 Colossal Serpent .
 I got a colossal serpent right here .
 Must you ?
 Sorry , I 'm just trying to cheer my buddy up .
 Rotting Zombie .
 Sheldon 's new Facebook photo .
 Zandor , Wizard of the North . Ha !
 I win .
 If you skip the part about being under a two- week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease -- absolutely .
