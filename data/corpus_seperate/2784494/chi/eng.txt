 00 : 00 : 02, 484 -- > 00 : 00 : 05, 286 I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies .
 Instead , it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again .
 We thought my 90- year- old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state , but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong .
 My point is , immortality is not only a possibility , it is real .
 Only if you 're this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm .
 If I could keep my Gmail account ,
 I 'd be okay with that .
 - Hello , fellas . - Hey . Remember when we were trying to figure out what that smell coming from Professor Tupperman 's office was ?
 Yeah ?
 Turns out it was Tupperman .
 Dead at his desk for two weeks . Oh , my God . That 's terrible .
 In lieu of flowers , the department chair is asking that everyone donate a bottle of Febreze .
 If we 're going to change the topic from jellyfish ,
 I 'd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle .
 Show a little compassion -- a man died . And turned into a puddle of goo .
 Now , we can either sit around and cry over spilt professor , or ... we can rejoice in the knowledge that a tenured position has just opened up .
 I choose to do the latter .
 Excuse me , the whole tenure system is ridiculous .
 A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent .
 If we really want science to advance , people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid .
 Well , I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure .
 If you need my nose , you 'll find it firmly lodged up the rectum of the tenure committee .
 You Ph. D 's gonna go suck up like Kripke ? No .
 I mean , I 'll apply , but I 'm not gonna stoop to playing politics . Yeah , me neither .
 It should be about the work .
 And if I can 't get tenure ,
 I 'd like to see you or Sheldon get it .
 Raj , don 't dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that .
 Excuse me , but I think I 'm just as qualified as you are . ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ...

 Original Air Date on April 4 , 2013 So " tenured " means a job for life ?
 Yup .
 And you can 't get fired even if you 're bad at it ?
 Mm , not really . Wow , sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory .
 While I disagree with the premise of tenure , if they gave it to me , it wouldn 't diminish my output .
 You know , I 'm like the sun .
 Can 't turn this off .
 Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well ?
 Mm- hmm . Do they know they don 't stand a chance
 ' cause you 're so great ?
 Well put .
 You know , I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend- girlfriend thing , but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running .
 It would be nice to have the increased income .
 Stop taking money from my parents .
 Money from family does come with strings attached .
 You have no idea . They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers ?

 No . " Rajesh , if you want a warm butt , you 're gonna have to pay for it yourself . "
 Well , maybe I will , old man !
 I think that 's enough wine for now .
 I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech .
 She 'd be proud , huh ? Oh , very .
 Assuming she takes my call .
 My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact .
 I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow .
 Or a chainsaw .
 Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out ... buy a house ... get married ... start a family .
 Yeah , or ... the chainsaw .
 And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant !
 And you know what will be on that elephant 's back ?
 A seat warmer .
 " No , Father , you may not have a ride ! " I 'm gonna make some coffee .
 So , who do you have to schmooze to get this deal ?
 I 'm not gonna schmooze anybody .
 I 'm gonna let my work speak for itself .
 That 's great .
 That shows a lot of integrity .
 Thank you .
 I 'm a naive idiot , right ?
 Oh , good , you heard me .
 You know , if you really want tenure , maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision .
 Sheldon Cooper does not do " cozy . "
 You don 't say . But I suppose it wouldn 't hurt to know who 's on the committee .
 Let 's see ...
 Oh , Janine Davis .
 Oh , dear .
 Is that a problem ? Well ...
 Yeah , even you .
 You 're a slave .
 I 'm a what ?
 I 'm not sure ; it could go either way .
 Hey .
 Mrs. Davis . Hey . Hey .
 Dr. Hofstadter . Yeah .
 Just thought I 'd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season .
 Good for you .
 Eh .
 Not that you need it .
 I bet you look great in a swimsuit .

 Thank you .
 I 've got what my father used to call " furniture disease . "
 My chest is falling into my drawers .
 I 'm not , uh , familiar with this model .
 How do I make it start ?
 You push start .
 Right .

 This one might be broken .
 You have to move . Got it .
 Oh .
 There .
 Oh , yeah !
 Yeah , now I 'm it .
 Oh , this is great .
 I could do this for the rest of my life .
 Hey , speaking ... speaking of things you do for the rest of your life ... uh , did I read that you 're on that- that tenure committee ?
 Yep .
 I got to get a home gym . Well , I 'm sure you have a lot of good applicants , I just wanted to say hi and ...
 let you know that I 'll be ... throwing my hat in the ... ... ring .
 All right , I 'll keep an eye out for that . Yeah .
 Hey , Hofstadter .
 Funny seeing you here for the first time in ... ever .
 Go ... away .
 Janine the Machine , let 's do this !
 Hey , Barry .
 Well , look at that .
 Burned a whole calorie . I guess you got here early to burn off that banana bread I baked you .

 Yeah , it was delicious .
 Thank you . No , my pleasure .
 Oh , if you ... if you like banana bread ...
 I 've got a- a great recipe . The trick is in ... in fresh ground ...
 I 'll e- mail it to you .
 All right , I 'm warm .
 Ready to kick it up a notch ?
 Let 's go .
 That 's enough cardio for me .
 I 'm just ... gonna stretch out before I hit the weights .
 You okay ?
 Call someone !
 Good day , Mrs. Davis .
 This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department . Don 't be alarmed ,
 I 'm not really in space .
 Anyhoo ...
 I 'd like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself , so sit back , relax and enjoy the following 90- minute video .
 Oh , come on .



 Mrs. Davis ?
 Mrs. Davis ? Mrs. Davis ?
 Mrs. Davis ?
 God , they 're everywhere .
 Come in .
 Dr. Cooper , how can I help you ?
 Yes , hello . I 'm fine . Um ...
 I understand you may have a bad impression of me , so I bought you a gift .
 Uh , Dr. Cooper , that 's not necessary .
 It 's too late .
 Get ready to like me .

 The tragic history of slavery in America .
 Fun for the whole family .
 Why would you think this is an appropriate gift ?
 Um ...
 Well ...
 You are black , right ?
 This meeting has come to an end .
 Because you want to start watching it right now .
 Copy that .
 Let 's see .
 Up next on the tenure committee is ...
 Professor Wu .
 Well , get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan .


 Gentlemen .
 Where have you been ? Nurse 's office .
 Asthma attack ? Asthma , heart -- some kind of attack .
 I 'm fine , though .
 You guys going to Professor Tupperman 's memorial ?
 I don 't know . Probably not .
 Barely knew him .
 Yeah , you wouldn 't want to look
 like you guys are brown- nosing the tenure committee , who will all be there .
 Oh , yeah , that 's what I was hoping for -- meerkats .

 I won 't be able to make our date night this Thursday , so ... bad news for you .
 You better have a good excuse this time , because " trimming Q- tips to fit your ears right " is obvious nonsense .
 First of all , when you say things like that , people think you 're crazy .
 Second , the reason I 'm cancelling is because
 I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman .
 It sounds like a long and tedious evening .
 Eh , it will be .
 Honestly , if I must endure a long and tedious evening ,
 I 'd rather it be with you on date night .
 But I have no choice .
 The tenure committee 's going to be there . Oh !
 Well , in that case , perhaps I should come along .
 Well , now that I think about it , that would be most helpful .
 Of course it would .
 I 'm well- versed in academic politics , and as a respected scientist ,
 I can only raise your stock as a candidate . Actually , I meant you could drive me .
 But if it makes you happy , that other stuff , too .

 Do anything interesting today ?
 Oh , not really . I was out shopping with Amy .
 She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing .
 Wait -- Sheldon 's going to be there ?
 We all promised we weren 't going to go .
 Oh , what a jerk . I know .
 I was hoping to go without anyone finding out .
 Well , since Amy 's going , do you want me there ?
 You know , to support you ?
 Oh ... that 's nice , but it- it 's just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I 'm not sure how much help you 'd be .
 Okay .
 I 'm just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that .

 Thanks , that would be great help .
 Oh , yeah .
 No .
 You realize you might kill some of them .
 Oh , then you can get tenure .

 Come on , Daddy .
 All the other scientists have seat warmers .
 This is so humiliating .
 I 've got to get tenure .
 Okay , l- let 's meet halfway .
 How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week ?
 Looks like we 're both going to be living like animals .

 Let 's go over our emotional responses one last time .
 Okay .
 Professor Tupperman is dead , and that makes us ... ? Sad .
 The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn 't make us cranky and claustrophobic .
 It makes us ... ?
 Glad .
 Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of was ... ?
 Bad . However ...
 No . Fine . Bad .
 Unbelievable .
 You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee .
 You 're here . Excuse me .
 I 'm here to pay my respects to Professor ...
 Tupperware , or whatever his name is .
 So am I.
 His passing makes me feel ... bad .
 Well , well , well , Sheldon , fancy meeting you here .
 I guess the train store in Glendale wasn 't having a cotillion after all .
 And you -- you said you weren 't coming here , either .
 I have a thick accent . You don 't know what I said .
 I 'd like to know why Penny 's here .
 I 'm here to support my man , just like you .
 What are you going to do ?
 Take people 's drink orders and get them wrong ?
 Do it .

 What ? Did she do it yet ?
 She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard 's cause .
 Well , that 's a fine how- do- you- do .
 Don 't just stand there .
 Take your breasts out .
 Ooh , meerkat fight !
 You 're all wasting your time .
 Sheldon is the most qualified for the job , and no amount of gravity- defying bosom 's going to change that .
 Seriously , is that tape ?
 Like , how are they staying up like that ? Way to hit 'em with both barrels .
 You two should be ashamed of yourselves .
 Using women to advance your cause with sexuality , and whatever Amy plans on doing .

 Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit ?
 Yes !
 Okay , because that was not clear .
 Sheldon !
 What ?
 That was ambiguous .
 Well , now it 's biguous .
 What are you gonna do about it ?
 Um ... You could talk some smack about his mother . Well , yes , of course , he wouldn 't like that at all .
 Last night ,
 I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother .

 Okay , okay . Guys , what are we doing here ?
 I don 't know what you 're doing , but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj 's mother for a dollar .
 Oh , you do what you want , but I don 't want to lose my friends over tenure .
 Friends are forever . So is tenure . Walk !
 I 'm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself .
 You 're right .
 This is beneath me .
 Like your mother was last night .
 How about it , Sheldon ? What do you think I should do ?
 Well , you 'll always be an academic success , but ...
 I seriously question whether you 'll make any more friends .

 I don 't want any more , but let 's go .
 Are you kidding ?
 I would " wove " to baby- sit for you .
 I could not ask you to do that .
 Nonsense .
 Children " wove " me .
 Something about me just makes them " waugh " and " waugh . "



 No .
 We cannot lose to that jerk .
 Yeah , screw it .
 I 'm going in .
 You ...
 Wait .
 Hold on .
 I believe " Screw it , I 'm going in " is what I said to your mother last night .
 Don 't worry , I didn 't really say that .
 I- I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off- putting .
 Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance .

 Mrs. Davis ?
 Mrs. Davis ?
 Mrs. Davis ? I know you 're in there .
 I saw your car in the parking lot .
 What ? I just found out that you recommended myself ,
 Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure .
 Well , despite your quirks , the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields .
 I don 't know what you mean by " quirks , " but , um ... ... I do want to express my gratitude .
 You didn 't bring another gift , did you ?
 No , no .
 No , I learned my lesson . I understand that was inappropriate .
 Good .
 Anyway , thank you .
 You 're welcome .

 I 'm gonna pretend that didn 't happen .
 Yeah , right on , sister .
