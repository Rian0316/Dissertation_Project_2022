 My brother -- he 's got a big crush on Bernadette .
 You 're moving back to India ?
 What 's going on ? ( laughs )
 It 's- It 's not what it looks like .
 What does it look like ?
 It 's not what it looks like .
 It 's not what it looks like .
 What are you grinding about ?
 Penny 's brain teaser this morning .
 She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom .
 She is disheveled , and Raj is dressed only in a sheet . The sole clue :
 " It 's not what it looks like . "
 Just let it go , Sheldon .
 If I could , I would , but I can 't , so I shan 't .
 Now , knowing Penny , the obvious answer is , they engaged in coitus .
 But ... since that 's what it looked like , we can rule that out .

 Let 's put on our thinking cap , shall we ?
 Raj is from India , a tropical country .
 Third World hygiene .
 Parasitic infections are common , such as pinworms . Mm- hmm .
 The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep , and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air .
 Yes , just like that .
 Penny could have been inspecting Raj 's anal region for parasites . Oh , boy .
 That 's a true blue friend .
 They slept together , Sherlock .
 No , you weren 't listening .
 She said it 's what it looks like .
 She lied .
 Oh .
 Don 't I look silly sitting here wearing this ?

 Original Air Date on September 22 , 2011
 Hey .
 Hey .
 Hey .
 Hey .
 Leonard , is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head ?

 No , I 'm fine with it .
 That sounds like sarcasm , but I 'm going to disregard it , because I have an agenda -- paintball .
 Specifically , the interdepartmental tournament this weekend .
 In order to function better as a fighting unit ,
 I thought we should establish a chain of command .
 Now , it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you , but the question remains , by how much ?
 Now , I don 't see me as some four- star general , back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defense .

 But I also can 't be Sergeant Cooper , because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe .
 This might take some thought .
 As you were .
 What the hell is wrong with you ?
 Yeah , how could you do that ?
 - What is it to you ?
 - I got his back .
 Yeah , right .
 You 're just jealous because it turns out I 'm Penny 's number two choice after Leonard .
 Hey , if I wasn 't engaged to Bernadette , that totally could have been me .
 Sheldon would have been before you , and he might not even have genitals ! Please .


 Why do you care so much ?
 You 're dating my sister , and Penny and I are in love .
 BOTH :
 What ? ! Gentlemen , if I may interject ,
 I 've decided my rank will be captain .
 If it 's good enough for Kirk , Crunch and Kangaroo , it 's good enough for me .
 You 're not in love with Penny .
 Yes , I am . The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love .
 Who ?
 He 's the Hindu version of Cupid , but way better , because he rides a giant parrot .
 Raj , come on .
 You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you .
 A month ago , you were writing poems about his fiancée .
 I 'm sorry .
 What ? !
 Rubbish .
 He 's talking rubbish .
 " Oh , Bernadette , please play my clarinet . "
 That could have been about anyone .
 Besides , you have nothing to worry about , because now I 'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny .
 For the record , I do have genitals .
 They 're functional and aesthetically pleasing .
 ( groans )
 Well .
 ( knocking ) Oh .
 Coming .
 Yup , that 's good . Wine glasses have handles .
 Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake .
 Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you 've had a few .
 You heard what I did ?
 Well , I heard you did .
 ( grunts )
 Oh , my God ,
 I screwed up everything .
 I hurt Leonard .
 I hurt Raj . I mean , what is wrong with me ?
 I feel like two totally different people --
 Dr. Jekyil and Mrs. Whore .



 Don 't be so hard on yourself .
 Do you know the story of Catherine the Great ?
 No .
 She ruled Russia in the late 1700s , and one night , when she was feeling particularly randy , she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse .


 I 'm ...
 I 'm sorry .
 What does this have to do with me ?
 She engaged in interspecies hanky- panky , and people still call her " Great . "
 I 'm sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy .
 ( knocking ) ( sighs )
 You jerk face !
 What did you tell Howard ? !
 Did you say there was something going on between us ?
 Because he thinks there is ! He 's completely freaking out !
 Please , come in .
 - What the hell is wrong with you ? !
 - Well ... You were always so nice to me , I thought maybe you liked me .
 I 'm nice to everyone !
 I 'm sorry .
 Damn right , you 're sorry !
 And you tell Howard there 's never been anything between us !
 - I will . Hey , Bernadette ?
 - What ? !
 Do you think I have a shot with Penny ?
 Of course you do .
 You 're a cutie pie !
 Any girl would be lucky to have you !
 You know , I 've done this before .
 In kindergarten ,
 I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess , but by the time my class got out there , he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb .
 So what did I do ?
 Hung upside down from the monkey bars ,
 let all the boys see my underpants .
 You can 't blame yourself .
 When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy , promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine .
 We neurobiologists refer to this as the " skank reflex . "
 You know what ?
 Let 's get out of here .
 Where are we going ?
 Somewhere where no one 's seen me naked .
 We may have to drive awhile .
 ( clears throat )
 Subtlety isn 't her strong suit , is it ?
 Can I stay at your place for a few nights ?
 Really ?
 A best friend sleepover ?
 Yay .
 Yeah , sure .
 Yay !
 We 'll make popcorn , stay up all night and I 'll teach you my secret language , Op.
 - Sounds great .
 - Nope .
 Sounds " Gop Rop E A Top . "
 - Yeah , I 'm gonna go pack a bag . - No , you 're not .
 You 're gonna " Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop . "
 Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball ?
 Who said that ?
 Leonard , I can hear your voice , but I can 't see you .
 I 'm not in the mood , Sheldon .
 Oh , there you are !
 Leonard ,
 I know you 're upset about recent events , and
 I have someone here to help .
 I don 't want to talk to Amy .
 No , it 's not Amy .
 Hello , dear .
 You called my mother ?
 Oh , Leonard , is it really necessary to caption the obvious ?
 He 's been like that since he was a toddler .
 " Look , Mommy -- a butterfly . "
 Maddening .
 What 's going on ?
 What do you want ?
 Sheldon informed me that you 're experiencing an emotional upheaval , and I 'm here to help .
 That 's so nice .
 And we 're back to the obvious .
 Now , what 's up ?
 Well , uh ... okay .
 Um ... I don 't want to get back together with Penny .
 We tried it , it was crazy , it didn 't work , but I can 't deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj .
 And then I find out that Raj 's sister Priya , who I 've been going out with for eight months , is moving back to India .
 So I 'm just completely confused and alone .
 I understand .
 Got any advice ?
 Yes . Buck up .

 Excuse me .
 You 're a world- renowned expert in parenting and child development , and all you 've got is " Buck up " ?
 Sorry .
 Buck up , sissy pants .
 Thanks , Mother . I feel much better .

 If you need any more help from me , my books are available on Amazon .
 Logging off .
 ... ninety- nine , one hundred .
 It 's like a waterfall of liquid gold .
 My turn .

 ( sighs ) You know , I don 't even know what the point of me staying in L. A. is .
 I haven 't gotten a single acting job since I moved out here .
 The closest I came was last month ,
 I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial .
 Oh , I could so see you being the face of hemorrhoids .
 I know , right ? ( sighs )
 Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska .
 No , I can 't let you do that .
 Why not ? ( knock on door )
 For the first time ever ,
 I have a thriving social life .
 And no pressure , but it kind of lives and dies with you .

 Hi , Amy . Can I talk to Penny ?
 A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door ?
 I wish I could tell 13- year- old me " it does get better . "
 How did you know I was here ?
 It 's all over her Facebook page .


 I 'll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer .
 Thanks .
 No problem .
 Try and keep it in your pants , okay ?

 So , hi .
 What 's up ? I was wondering if you 're free Friday .
 They 're having a Totally ' 80s Night at the Greek .
 Hall & Oates , Katrina and the Waves and three- fifths of Kajagoogoo .
 ( chuckles ) :
 Oh . Gee , that 's really sweet , but the thing is ...
 Aw , there 's a thing .
 Look , honey , I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night .
 We should 've never slept together . It 's what ruins friendships .
 You can 't ruin a friendship with sex .
 That 's like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles .

 Come here . Just listen to me .
 I want to go back to the way we were before .
 You know , friends .
 No sprinkles .
 Oh .
 All right .
 Thank you .
 ( sighs ) Well , uh ... ( clears throat ) as your friend , you might like to know that , um ...
 we didn 't have sex in the conventional sense .

 Oh , God .
 Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me ?
 No , no .
 After we got undressed and jumped in bed , you- you asked if I had protection .
 Oh , you did , didn 't you ?
 Of course . I 'm always packing .
 Anyway , um , I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and ...
 that was all she wrote .


 So , we didn 't actually ...
 I did .
 It was beautiful .
 Oh !
 Penny , please , please promise me you won 't tell anybody about this .
 Of course I won 't . No , I won 't . Oh , good .
 ( exhales )
 Um , can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly ?
 Kind of a " Candle in the Wind " deal ?
 Sure . Cool .
 Can I say it fell apart because you were all , " I want to have your babies " and I was like , " I 'm too rock and roll to be tied down " ?
 No .
 Can I say I ruined you for white men ?
 Also no .
 Okay , just the candle thing .
 Yeah . Cool .
 All right ... friend . Hmm .
 I 'll see you around .
 Okay .
 Raj , wait .
 Thank you for being my friend .
 Penny ? Mm- hmm ?
 It 's getting beautiful again .
 All right , this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle .
 I don 't see anything . Give it a second to load .
 Whenever you 're ready , AT& T !
 Okay , here we go .
 This is us here .
 To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department .
 According to their Twitter feed , they 're out of sunblock , which means they 'll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma .
 That 's our edge .
 All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge , the rock- worshipping pasty- faced bastards won 't know what hit them !
 All right , let 's move out .
 Hang on , Sheldon .
 How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India ?
 Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancée .
 Screw you .
 That was a beautifully written penis metaphor .
 You know what , guys , I 'm not in the mood for paintball .
 What do you say we just bag it ?
 - Fine with me . - Sure , whatever .
 You can 't quit .
 That 's a court - martial offense .
 That 's punishable by ...
 You can 't quit .
 Sorry , Sheldon , it 's just not a good time for playing games .
 This is a game to you ?
 Uh , was the Battle of Antietam a game ?
 Huh ?
 Was the sack of Rome a game ?
 Yes , no and no .
 Wait . I just want you all to know that I forgive you .
 This mutiny isn 't your fault , it 's mine .
 I haven 't earned these bars .

 Although what I lack in leadership , apparently I more than make up for in sewing .
 Let it go , Sheldon .
 I 'll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home .
 No .
 Jamba Juice is for heroes . And that 's what we 're going to be .

 What are you doing ? Following in the footsteps of Kirk , Crunch and Kangaroo .
 ( people shouting in distance )
 Geology isn 't a real science !
 ( paintball guns popping )
 ( popping ceases )
 Damn those sons of bitches !
 Let 's get 'em !
 Eat paint !
 ( yelling )

 If there 's ever a Church of Sheldon , this will be when it started .
 ( paintball guns popping )
 Ow !
 I 'd like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory ,
 Captain Sheldon Cooper .
 Hear , hear . Hear , hear .
 Excuse me . It 's Sheldon Cooper .
 With my last breath ,
 I awarded myself a battlefield promotion .
 It 's kind of a big deal .
 ( knock on door )
 Hi .
 You guys have a minute ?
 Uh , yeah , sure .
 Okay .
 Um ... ( clears throat )
 Well , I already talked to Raj , but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for , you know , everything .
 Please , Penny , let me . ( clears throat )
 We 've decided to let our crazy , wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you 're feeling blue or you 're in the shower .

 Hey , what you doing , Quick Draw ?


 Sorry . Go on .
 ( clears throat )
 Anyways , I wanted you guys all to know that I 've been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion
 I have to stop kidding myself .
 I suck at acting .
 It 's time for me to move back to Nebraska .
 You 're leaving ?
 Yeah . What are you going to do in Nebraska ?
 I don 't know , maybe teach acting .
 ( cell phone ringing )
 Oh , sorry . Hold on . Hello ?
 Penny , listen , I hope you 're not doing this 'cause of you and me , because I have a girlfriend , and you 're a single woman ...

 Shh !
 It 's my agent , it 's my agent . You 're kidding .

 Oh , my gosh .
 I can 't believe it !
 Really ? !
 Oh , I 'm so excited ! Thank you !
 Thank you so much .
 Okay , bye .
 I got the hemorrhoid commercial !
 I start Monday !

 What about Nebraska ? Oh , hell with Nebraska .
 I 'm gonna be a star !
 ( door closes )

 Have you ever thought of teaching physics ?


 Ready to ride ?
 I don 't think so , Mom .
 Not today .
 Oh , sweetie .
 Hemorrhoids acting up again ?
 You don 't know the half of it .
 Oh , yes , I do . Try a dab of this .
 " Rose- scented Preparation- H for women ? "
 Now , the " H " is for " her . "


 I 'm proud of you .
 Shh ! Here comes my joke .
 How you doing ?
 Sittin ' pretty .
