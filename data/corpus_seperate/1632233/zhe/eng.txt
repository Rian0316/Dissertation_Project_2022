 Morning .
 ( exhales ) - Sleep okay ?
 - Um uh .
 Great !
 Hey , can I ask you something ?
 Sure .
 Last night , me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra .
 Was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive ?
 Yes .
 Just because you 're in bed with an India woman you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual .
 Hey , if you can find a book called " Weird Sex with White Boys "
 I 'd be okay with that .
 ( laughing )
 No , no , you know you have such beautiful eyes .
 Have you ever thought about getting contacts ?
 I tried in the seventh grade .
 I could never get used to them .
 Oh . That 's too bad .
 Yeah . If I had contacts , I would have been the coolest
 Debate Club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case .
 If you had them on now , you could see what we 're going to do next .
 That- That 's okay .
 I can infer from context .
 Hey , Raj , you wanna see a new magic trick I been working on ?
 Eh , Howard .
 If I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice .
 Is working on magic tricks , really how you want to spend your time ?
 Uh , granted , you 're just an engineer , but ...
 That doesn 't mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that that may get you a " thank you " in someone else 's Nobel Prize acceptance speech .
 Is the trick making him disappear ?
 Sure , let 's see it .
 Here . Shuffle these .
 Okay .
 Now spread them out on the table . Face down .
 Pick one . Look at it .
 Okay .
 Now remember your card . Put it back in the deck .
 Is it any wonder he doesn 't have a doctorate ?
 Now remind me , what 's your birthday ?
 October sixth .
 Okay , October is the tenth month .
 So 10 -- one plus zero is one plus six is seven .
 Turn over the seventh card .
 How about that !
 But , is that your card ?
 Yes . It is .
 Very cool !
 Oh it 's not cool .
 It 's a childish trick , designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons .
 How 'd you do it ?
 A magician never reveals his secrets .
 But surely a future Nobel Prize winner can figure it out .
 Fine .
 Give me a second .
 You ever notice when he thinks real hard it smells like bacon ?
 - Oh hey ! - Sorry !
 Oop !





 Check it out .
 I just got contacts .

 One , two , three , four , five .
 No way .
 That 's your card , right ?
 Seven of clubs !
 That is amazing !
 It 's not amazing .
 All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet .
 Oh , really ?
 So how did I do it ?
 I don 't care how you did it .
 I have more important things to think about .
 Clearly , the cards are marked .
 I thought you had more important things to think about .
 I do .
 You just happened to have caught me on a break .
 Oh , let me see those cards .
 Big deal .
 Not knowing is part of the fun .
 " Not knowing is part of the fun . "
 Was that the motto of your community college ?
 Hey , guys , what do you think ?
 Priya took me clothes shopping .
 Hey , you look great .
 Good for you , Priya .
 I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were ...
 Well , you look great .
 Thank you .
 Lets go hang everything up .
 Yeah , good .
 New contacts .
 I should have done this years ago .
 So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis ?
 I 'm not going out with him .
 He can sleep with whoever he wants .
 Yeah , I was talking to Raj .
 Oopsy .
 This deck is rigged in some fashion . Fine .
 Get another deck and I 'll do the trick with that .
 So you 're saying this is a regulation deck ?
 I 'm saying believe in magic , you muggle .
 You know , well , I 'm happy Leonard 's found someone .
 Not that anybody asked .
 How many uniforms do you have ?
 Just two : everyday and dress .
 Uh- huh .
 Listen , we need to talk about something .
 Oh , my God , you 're breaking up with me !
 Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me ?
 That is so cruel !
 Leonard , I 'm not breaking up with you .
 Oh , okay .
 So , what 's up ?
 It 's a little weird , your ex- girlfriend hanging out here all the time .
 I know .
 I usually never see my ex- girlfriends , unless their hard drives crash .
 I 'm just saying , how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex- boyfriend ?
 Um , not great , I guess .
 But Penny and I are just friends .
 I don 't care .
 This is a woman you have slept with .
 If you want her around , then I have to wonder if maybe you 're not ready to move on .
 No , no- no- no , I 'm ready !
 I gave up the gift of sight for you .
 If that 's not moving on , what is ?
 You need to cut the cord with Penny .
 Oh ... okay .
 You don 't sound very confident .
 No , no , I 'm confident .
 Its not like I 'm unfamiliar with the " get lost " conversation .
 Although , this will be the first time I 'll be the one saying it .
 Thank you .
 I appreciate it .
 Sure .
 Oh , God , you smell so good .
 Of course , that could just be my other senses getting stronger .
 Hypothetically , if I had access to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform , would you wear it ?
 Leonard , it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe .
 Can we not discuss it ?
 I 'm sorry .
 Never mind .
 And was your card the jack of diamonds ?
 Oh , unbelievable !
 Know how he did it yet ?
 Um ...
 Aw , he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can 't figure out how I got his nose .
 You know , I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed .
 Like , ooh , look !
 The pencil 's rubber !
 Hey , I think I know how you did the card trick .
 Oh , please , if I don 't know , you don 't know .
 That 's axiomatic .
 Come here .
 You 're right .
 Not too bad for someone who doesn 't know what " axiomatic " means .
 Oh , hi .
 Hey , you .
 What happened with the contacts ?
 One of them 's upstairs .
 The other one sort of slipped back into my skull .
 Hey , is that one of the new shirts Priya got you ?
 Yeah .
 You don 't wanna wash that . No ?
 No , that 's silk .
 Seriously , what would you do without me ? Yeah .
 ( chuckles )
 You know , I gotta tell you , I think you got a real winner with Priya .
 Yeah , me , too .
 She seems really sweet .
 Believe me , you do not want to take that for granted .
 There are a lot of bitches out there .
 Yeah , bitches are the worst .
 All right , I 'll see you later .
 Uh , Penny , there 's something I have to tell you .
 What ?
 Okay , uh , how do I put this ?
 Um ... are you familiar with Darwin 's observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands ?
 Did they make a movie about it ? No .
 Then no .
 All right , well , anyway , Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source , eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else .
 Okay .
 So what do you think we can learn from that behavior that we can apply to our own lives ?
 Uh , a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush ?
 Sure , that has birds in it .
 It 's fun talking to you , Leonard ; I always learn stuff .
 I 'm sorry , but I 'm gonna count that .
 PRlYA : Do you really have to wear that in bed ?
 Yeah .
 The doctor didn 't want me to rub my eye during the night .
 It was either this or one of those giant neck cones .
 So did you get to talk to Penny ?
 Oh , yes .
 Indeed , I did .
 And ?
 She completely understood everything I said .
 Case closed .
 Was she upset ?
 Maybe , but that 's not my problem .
 She 's not my girlfriend , you are .
 I hope you weren 't cruel to her .
 Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die , or is that just nature 's way ?
 ( knocking ) SHELDON : Leonard ?
 ( knocking ) Leonard ?
 Leonard ? What ? !
 I think I figured out Wolowitz 's magic trick , and I need you to pick a card .
 I am not opening that door , Sheldon !
 As you wish .
 Pick a card , put it back , and prepare to be amazed .
 Did you pick one ?
 Yep .
 Is this your card ?
 Nope .
 Drat .
 Is this your card ?
 No .
 I 'll be right back .
 Pick a card , Sheldon .
 Now look at it , and put it back in the deck .
 Now do you remember your card ?
 Of course I do , I have an eidetic memory .
 My apologies .
 Now shuffle the cards .
 Shuffling .
 Wait here .
 Processing image , cross- referencing ...
 Whatcha doin ' ?
 I 'm reverse engineering Wolowitz 's magic trick .
 What 's up with the infrared cameras ?
 I 'm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one 's been touched .
 By the way , if you hope to have children ,
 I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers .
 Your testicles look a tad warm .
 Holy crap , are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ?
 Yes .
 I 'm using their Cray supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns .
 Sheldon , that computer is used for national defense .
 Hacking into it is a federal crime .
 Relax , we 're not under attack right now .
 Okay , I 'm leaving before the black helicopters get here .
 And is this my card ?
 Rats !
 I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer .
 Where am I going to find uranium- 235 this time of night ?
 Come on , CraigsList .
 Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant ?
 It 's okay , I like Indian food .
 Or as you probably call it back home , " food . " ( chuckles )
 Why didn 't you wear your contacts ?
 Don 't you like them ?
 No , no , I do .
 It 's just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time .
 You know ... ( clears throat ) ... my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles .
 Does that mean you 'd relocate here permanently ? Maybe .
 What do you think ?
 I love it .
 That 's great ! ( knocking )
 Hi !
 Hi !
 Just hang on .
 ( chuckles ) Small world .
 You did talk to her , didn 't you ?
 Of course , I did .
 I talked and talked and talked .
 Hey !
 Look at Leonard in his fancy- ass grownup clothes .
 Way to go , Priya .
 For once , he doesn 't look
 like a mannequin in the boys ' department .
 ( chuckles ) Hey , did he tell you I saved the silk shirt ?
 No , he did not .
 He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear .
 That 's our Lenny , huh ? ( laughs )
 Yes , that 's our Lenny .
 So how 's the food here ?
 Oh , wow , that is really , really good . Oh , I 'm sorry .
 You guys are on a date .
 We can hang out anytime . Have fun .
 Bye .
 Good night .

 Oh , that 's , hot , hot , hot , hot ! Whoo !
 It really sneaks up on ya , huh ?
 All right , I gotta go .
 It is pretty spicy .
 Oh , I 've been meaning to tell you ,
 I figured out your magic trick .
 Really ?
 Oh , yes .
 In fact , I improved upon it .
 I 'd love to see that .
 How about you , Raj ?
 Beefaroni a show ?
 How do you turn that down ?
 All right .
 ( clears throat )
 Pick a card .
 Okay .
 Bippity- boppity- boo . ( beeps )
 What 's with the wand and the beep ?
 The wand is called showmanship , and the beep is none of your business .
 ( text alert tone sounds )
 Oh !
 Excuse me .
 I 'm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick .
 Oh , look , my dry cleaning 's ready .
 And your card was the five of spades .
 Ta- da .
 These cards have barcodes on them .
 The wand is a reader .
 It 's transmitting to your phone .
 I said , " ta- da . "
 Show 's over .
 That 's pathetic .
 Let me show you how a real magician does it .
 Raj , take a card .
 Don 't let me see it .
 Okay .
 Three of clubs .
 Son of a gun , you 're blowing my mind !
 Bippity- boppity- boo- yah !
 That does it .
 I 'm getting uranium .
 You ever gonna tell him ?
 Maybe .
 When it stops being fun .
 So never .
 Oh , hey , I was just on my way to work .
 Oh , okay , its not important .
 It can wait .
 No , it 's all right .
 Walk me down .
 So , what 's up ?
 Uh , I kind of have a problem
 I was hoping you could help me with .
 Sure , anything .
 Move out .
 What ?
 Not far .
 Hey , if you ever wanna start a family ,
 La Cañada has some great schools .
 Okay , I 'm not moving anywhere .
 What the hell is this all about ?
 Why does it have to be about anything ?
 Can 't a fella ask his buddy to relocate , no questions asked ?
 Oh , for God 's sake , Leonard , this is about Priya , isn 't it ?
 She doesn 't want me hanging out with you . Yes .
 There , I said it .
 Okay , look .
 I happen to like your girlfriend .
 And she likes you .
 No , she doesn 't .
 Not really , no .
 It doesn 't matter .
 Look , I promise from now on
 I will keep my distance from you .
 Well , now , hold on .
 What kind of distance are we talking about ?
 Because we are neighbors .
 I mean , I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment .
 You can hear my toilet flush ?
 I don 't listen for it , but it 's nice to know everything 's okay with your plumbing .
 The building 's plumbing .
 Leonard , I get it .
 You 're in a new relationship now .
 And I 'm happy for you .
 So why don 't we just shake hands and part friends ?
 Well , now hold on .
 How about this ?
 How about we still hang out , but on the down- low ?
 Are you really that kind of guy ?
 No .
 I actually felt kinda silly just saying " on the down- low . "
 Good- bye , Leonard .
 Penny , wait .
 Ah !
 Damn contacts .
 Incoming .
 - Hi !
 - Hey !
 Hello .
 Why so glum , chum ?
 Apparently , you can 't hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother .

 Oh , that 's too bad .
 Figure out the magic trick yet ?
 ( mocking ) : Figure out the magic trick yet ?
 Want me to tell you how to do it ?
 No .
 Ill show you one more time .
 Raj ?
 Hang on .
 This time do it with me , so I can make sure there 's no monkey business .
 All right .
 Two of hearts .
 I hate you .
 Yeah , he 's gonna win the Nobel Prize .
