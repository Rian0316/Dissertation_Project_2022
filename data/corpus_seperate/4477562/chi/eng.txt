 00 : 00 : 02, 168 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 702 Oleg , the people at Table Two want to know what 's in the veggie burger .
 No .
 They don 't .
 Eh .
 That 's fine .
 They wanted refills , so I 'm probably not gonna go back there anyway .
 Where 's Max ?
 This plate has been here so long , the salmon is turning into Salmonella .
 She took a break with the new dishwasher .
 Max , I thought you slipped out the back .
 He did for a minute , but I popped him back in .
 This just in , work is so much more fun when you 're sleeping with a co- worker .
 Max , that was good .
 It was five Hail Marys good .
 I think we made these dishes dirtier .
 Max , he 's cute , but how can you even stay hard with that accent ?
 " Come here , Max .
 I wanna hump ya a wee bit " .
 What can I say , I always had a thing for the guy on the box of Lucky Charms .

 Hey , everybody .
 Look , I got me a Fitbit . 13 , 14 , 15 ...
 Only 200, 000 more steps before I get a bit more fit for my wedding .
 That 's impressive .
 I couldn 't even make it through 12 steps .
 Hey , Max .
 How 's my maid of honor ?
 Hey , Caroline .
 How 's my run- of- the- mill wedding guest ?
 I 'm doing great . Did that sound convincing ?
 ' Cause I 've been practicing it in the bathroom mirror for an hour every morning .
 I know , I 've got to stop sitting on the toilet while you do that .
 Max , let 's talk bridesmaid dresses .
 I don 't care , I 'll wear anything .
 I wore a Greyhound Bus driver 's uniform to my prom .
 I was coming straight from work .
 Well , I have decided to wear
 Grandma Kuchenski 's wedding gown .
 Yeah , all of the women in my family wore it .
 Everyone except aunts Svetti and Letti ,
 ' cause , well , they 're attached at the abdomen .
 There she is .
 The hot sauce for my Huevos Mancheros .
 Hey , Sophie , baby , I got you what you want . Oleg , no one wants Hepatitis .
 It 's official .
 Our wedding 's gonna be in
 Oleg , how are you gonna be in
 tends to be picky and you tend to be more " picky your nose . "
 You know , my second wedding made
 ' Cause my first wife showed up and shot me in the leg . [ phone dings ]
 That 's Vlanka , my sister . She 's my other bridesmaid .
 Yeah , we 're not that close , but I feel bad for her
 ' cause she 's one of those adults with freckles .

 Max , you 're going to be in
 In Times , wearing God knows what Sophie will pick .
 I mean , she has a drawer full of diamond tiaras for the gym .

 Hello , what are you two talking about ?
 Deciding which tables to ignore ?
 We 're talking about Sophie 's taste .
 Oh , bitch , please .
 Come on .
 My morning fiber cookie has better taste than Sophie .
 Girls , Vlanka 's out . She has an attitude and freckles .
 Yeah . I mean , that 's too far .
 So , Caroline , congratulations !
 You 're my new bridesmaid !


 Okay , I found a bridesmaid 's dress that I like .
 But the only way we can afford it is if I sell you to that Armenian guy on Craigslist .
 No way .
 I get sick of hummus after four bites .
 Max , we have to take charge of this .
 Because whatever bridesmaid 's dress Sophie picks is like a Tyler Perry movie .
 I don 't have to see it to know it 's gonna be awful .


 We 'll find something classy , and beautiful , and just shove it down her throat .
 Who 's shoving what down whom ?
 And if you don 't have a story , I do .
 John , Max and I got roped into being bridesmaids . Stop . You had me at rope .
 You lost me at bridesmaids .
 I 'll be at the hostess stand , looking at dresses and silently wishing for an asteroid to wipe us off the planet .
 If wishes made things happen , we 'd been in the middle of a zombie apocalypse right now .
 Hey , girls .
 My dress just arrived from Poland and I 'm bustin ' for you to see it .
 See it while I eat one of your $14 puddings .
 Sophie , I 've been looking at color choices , and how would you feel about us in a nude ?
 Max could go nude but you don 't have the rack to pull it off .
 Does anyone have a knife ?


 Max , why do you have a switchblade to work in a dessert bar ?
 My mother always told me to carry protection .
 Wait 'til you see Grandma Kuchenski 's dress . They don 't make them like they used to .
 You know , forced gypsy labor is illegal now .
 Here we go . - Oh . - Uh ...
 Sophie , was your grandma the Crypt Keeper ?


 What 's going on out here ?
 What 's all that white powder in the air ?
 I 'm trying to run a restaurant , not an 80 's disco .
 Oh , put a sock in it .
 I 'm buying one of your freaking overpriced puddings .

 I 'd get mad but I 'm mildly attracted to you right now . Just mildly ?

 I mean , now I 'm getting mad .
 Sorry . Wedding drama .
 Her dress just fell completely to pieces ...
 like I 'm assuming I 'll do in the near future .
 Whatever you need anything bridal , go to Rosenfeld 's in Brooklyn .
 That 's where I got my dress when I was broke and straight .
 So you weren 't always into women ?
 Of course I was .
 Except those three years in Scientology .
 Well , it looks like the three of us are going to go dress shopping now .
 Yeah . And you know , I got to go wash my hands
 ' cause they 're covered in old lady DNA .

 Well , that 's that .
 Shopping with Sophie is like when I worked in a Thai massage parlor .
 We are going down .

 Not if we go before Sophie and hide every ugly bridesmaid 's dress that Sophie would like .
 If she can 't see them , she can 't make us wear them .
 How did you come up with that so fast ?
 It 's the same plan I used in 2010 when I was a bridesmaid for Chelsea Clinton .
 Bad dress and then her father followed me into the coat room .

 Oh , wow .
 Look at this place . It reminds me of that movie .
 -
 - No ,
 I don 't know what you 're worried about , Caroline .
 I think they 're all quite lovely .
 Nash , please .
 You 're a poor person from Ireland .
 I 'll ask your opinion when I need to know where to go to get free leg braces .
 You were right , Max .
 She can be a real " B " sometimes .
 I 'm sorry , but I don 't even know why he 's here .
 Bonin ' O 'Brien here ... is gonna distract the sales lady while we hide the ugly dresses .
 Hello , ladies .
 Same plan .
 Who 's the lucky bride ?
 Or should I say , who 's the lucky cradle robber ?
 Don 't mind me . It 's just my crazy sense of humor .
 Oh , the ladies here love it .
 The call me " Crazy Carl . "
 [ raspy voice ]
 " Did you hear what Crazy Carl said ? "
 They just love it .
 I 'm Caroline .
 This is Max and he isn 't the groom .
 No , no , no .
 He 's single and gay .
 Yes . So gay , he got kicked out of One Direction .


 Why don 't you two walk off somewhere and share poignant coming- out stories .
 Go .
 - But Max -- - Oh , you heard the women , go .
 Can do .
 Ladies , look around , we 'll be back ... in about a month .
 Tahiti anyone ?
 I 'm just Crazy Carl . The ladies love it .

 Bridesmaid 's dresses should be called what they are .
 Really expensive donations to Goodwill .
 Is this one bad ? No .
 That 's a Vera Wang .
 But this is a very wrong .
 Hide it .
 Ew .
 And it 's evil twin .
 Oh , I didn 't know hazmat suits came with feathers .
 Oh my God .
 This the worst thing I 've ever seen .
 And I 've seen a prostitute change her tampon on the sidewalk .
 Who are you calling a prostitute ?

 This , we 've got to hide . I can 't get this dress off .
 Just tell it you work at Google and you 're thinking of settling down .
 Lift it up . Lift it up . Dump it back there .
 Stop !
 You put Butterscotch Betty down .
 Oh , we were just looking for a price tag .
 I know what 's going on here .
 You 're hiding the good dresses to make sure no one else can get them at our annual half- off sale tomorrow .
 Yeah , that 's what we 're doing .
 We 're hiding the good dresses .
 In fact , I just caught another Sneaky Sue .
 Oh , I 'm Sophie .
 Oh , wow , wow , wow .
 Oh , look at the color . That 's not color .
 That 's radiation .
 That dress is a one of a kind .
 Meaning there 's only one ? No , we have two .

 And I have two bridesmaids !
 I love it when life works out perfect like this .

 [ indistinct chatter ]
 ( Public address announcement ) Ladies , our half off sale will begin in a minute .
 Look at this place .
 There are more desperate women crammed in here than the splash zone at a Kenny Chesney concert .
 I know .
 It 's like Black Friday at Walmart And like Black Friday , hopefully someone will trample me .

 Cause thanks to these dresses , my life is over .
 Max , did you hear me ? My life is over . You said that when the Chinese food place forgot the duck sauce .


 Well , I 'm sorry , but I had a whole other scenario planned for my return to
 " Entrepreneur rises from the ashes . "
 Now , I 'm just going to be in
 looking like a stupid ash . Shoot , girl , just push on through .
 I 'm pushing , girl .
 I am pushing . ( both ) Excuse us .
 Excuse us .
 Excuse us .
 Just go , girl .
 I don 't want anybody else to get those two yellow dresses .
 Max , did you hear that ?
 Someone has worst taste than Sophie .
 Now we just have to hang back here and let them get to those dresses first . Yay !
 My life is good again .
 Max , Caroline , up here .
 What was that , like , a second ? I saved you a space upfront .
 Come on .
 Well , it 's over . As soon as they cut that ribbon ,
 Sophie 's going to Marshawn Lynch everyone who gets in the way of us and those dresses .
 There 's only one way out of this .
 And you called it earlier .
 You have to let them trample you .
 I 'm serious .
 I 'm not about to be trampled on purpose .
 See if you still feel that way after I say these next few words :
 " Pictured from left , Caroline Channing . "
 Try to fend off any heels you see heading for my eyes .
 Attention , ladies . As you see , I have the big scissors , which can only mean it 's time ... to trim some nose hairs !

 [ laughter ]
 That Carl is crazy .
 The annual bridal sale ... - is now ... - Max , hold my hand .
 Open !
 [ all shouting ]



 Ladies , ladies , one at a time .
 Oh !
 Well , I may be limping down the aisle , but at least I won 't be limping in something Swiffer might sell to dust off ceiling fans .
 [ woman screaming ]
 Oh , my God , girl ! here she comes !
 Here she comes .
 My girl , Rhonda , had that dress first .
 Oh , your girl is gonna have to pry it out of my cold , dead hands .
 Hey , Max , Caroline !
 Try it on !
 Follow me to the changing room .


 ( Caroline ) I 'm never coming out in this dress , I 'm scared .
 ( Max ) So on the count of one , two ...
 Maybe it 's not that bad .


 ( both ) It 's bad . Okay .
 So you 're telling me ,
 Versace got murdered , but no one 's taken out whoever made these ? I know .
 I feel like Tweety Bird is gonna sue us for copyright infringement .

 I feel like we should have giant toilet paper rolls under here .

 Well , maybe we 'll like these better when we 're out of this bright light .
 Max , we are the bright light .
 Ladies , you forgot the matching hats .
 There 's more ?
 Oh , if anyone finds a Xanax , it 's mine .
 It was knocked out of my hand by two women duking it out over a chintz mermaid dress .
 Oh , now it looks good .

 There 's Xanax on the loose and I 'm just standing here ?
 At least if I was high , I 'd have an excuse to be wearing this .
 Here pilly , pilly .
 Here pilly , pilly , pilly .
 Girl , for real , you look like straight up crap in that dress .
 For real .
 You white girls can 't pull that color off . That 's a waste of poppin ' lemon yellow .
 I know . I am way too white for this .
 She 's also too white to say " turnt up " all the time , but that hasn 't stopped her .
 This dress was not my choice .
 I hate everything about it . This is a disaster . This is " Dressageddon . "
 Yeah , but in a good way .
 You two don 't want to wear the dresses .
 You don 't have to .
 But I thought you wanted us to match the balloons and the ducks .
 Max , she said we don 't have to wear the dress .
 Don 't question her !
 That 's like questioning a prison guard when he says you 're free to go .
 Sophie , are you sure you don 't care ?
 Oh , yeah .
 Sure .
 Yeah , they 're all yours , Destiny 's Child .





 This is ten pounds of ugly junk .
 Reminds me of this bartender , Pete , I used to date .
 Come to think of it , that made me gag , too . Okay .
 Done . [ woman crying ]
 Listen , crying in a women 's dressing room ?
 Whoever it is , girl , big butts are in .
 [ crying continues ] That 's Sophie 's cry .
 I know , 'cause I hear it through the vent when she watches
 Sophie ?
 ( Sophie ) No .
 Are you okay ?
 ( Sophie ) It 's not me , but I 'm okay .
 [ sobbing continues ]
 Sophie , why are you crying ? When I heard what you said about the dresses ...
 It 's just --
 It 's almost , kind of like , you think I have bad taste or something .
 No .
 Caroline thinks you have great taste .
 She does ?
 Well , then she should say so . Now .


 Well , Sophie , I think you have your own unique style .
 And I think ... that I didn 't hear the words " great " or " taste . "
 Sophie , what do you even care what I think ?
 Just say it !
 Sophie , I think you have great taste .

 You do ?
 [ Sophie laughs ]
 Then , what are we doing sitting here ?
 Let 's go and get those dresses back !
 Come on .
 Help me !



 Those other girls already took them .
 What ?
 Well , at least we don 't have to wear those ugly , yellow bridesmaid dresses at the wedding .
 Yup .
 Now , you only have to wear ugly , yellow dresses here , every night .
 This is the best thing that 's happened to me since I realized that weird mole on my arm was just a Grape- Nut and not cancer .

 Girls , great news .
 You stuffed Han in the microwave and you 're ready to hit power ?
 Come on . We 've tried .
 You know he doesn 't fit .
 The one thing he 's too big for .
 No , I got Ilia Jorbich to be our wedding photographer .
 He 's the best photographer at
 Well , he 's the only one who still has both arms .
 Wait , it 's the
 All this time , I 've been thinking it was

 This is much more exclusive .
 You can only get it in two places .
 Poland and the deli in New Jersey that sells missiles .
 This is amazing .
 My comeback in has been preserved .
 Max , I 'm gonna go ahead and smile . My life is good again .
 Don 't smile yet , ' cause Sophie told me that because you said she had such good taste , she 's designing our dresses herself .

 What was that , like a second ?
 You just went from the best of times to Yup .
