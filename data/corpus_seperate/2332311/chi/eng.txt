 00 : 00 : 12, 242 -- > 00 : 00 : 15, 460 I wish you could all be inside my head .
 The conversation is sparkling .
 Fine , I 'll tell you .
 A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species , fungi and algae .
 If you could merge with another species , what species would you pick and why ? Hint :
 There is a right answer .
 None of you will get it .
 Okay , I 'd pick swan because , uh , the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck
 I 've always dreamed of having .
 Wrong . Leonard ?
 Horse , but mostly just for the height .
 A little bit for the genital girth .
 Wrong , and let 's keep it clean , shall we ?
 Kangaroo , uh , I 'd be Kanga- Jew .
 The first of my people to dunk a basketball .
 Also instead of just living in your mother 's house , you could actually live inside her body .
 Clever , but also wrong . No , the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself .
 That way , you 'd be human , fungus , and algae . Triple threat . Like three- bean salad .
 Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful .
 All right , picture this : a beautiful outdoor concert .
 Now , as a human , I appreciate Beethoven .
 As a fungus , I have a terrific view , growing out of a towering maple tree .
 And no thank you , expensive concessions . Because as an algae , I 'll just snack on this sunlight .
 - He got us again . - No , he didn 't .
 Anyway , if it 's okay with you , we should talk about Howard 's bachelor party . Oh , oh .
 Seems like a bit of a letdown after our lichen conversation , but ... What do you know , you 're half swan .
 I 've been doing some research on strippers . One agency I spoke to , said I could get us a great price if we 're flexible on age range and number of limbs .

 Sounds like loads of fun , but I promised Bernadette no strippers . You don 't want strippers ?
 You 're the king of strippers . The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you .
 What can I tell ya -- I 'm not into that stuff anymore . Good for you , Howard .
 I 'm proud of you .
 And still , you 're the first one of use to get married . We have to do something special .
 You know Germans have an interesting pre- wedding custom --
 Well , it 's probably not for me .
 Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley . They 've got that wine train . Boo , wine !
 But yay , trains . I 'm in .
 Anyway , it 's a beautiful time of year . Uh , you travel through the vineyards . There 's a tasting on board .
 And all the wildflowers are in bloom . Magic .
 Look at that , in 30 seconds , we went from hiring women to being them .

 Original Air Date on April 26 , 2012
 So , I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight .
 Yeah , just going to a restaurant , get some steaks , and scotch .
 Nothing to worry about . Why should I worry ? Well , I don 't know .
 It 's a bachelor party . There could be strippers . Wouldn 't that make you a little jealous ?
 Oh , come on Leonard , it 's you . What 's going to happen ?
 I mean , even if there was a stripper , all you 'd do is avoid eye- contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework .
 Hey , I am a young man in his sexual prime . Under the right conditions , I- I- I am capable of just , really crazy stuff . Really ?
 What is the craziest thing you 've ever done with a woman ?
 And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count . Oh , come on . That 's got to count .
 There was a really strong undertow , we could have died .
 Well , have fun tonight .
 Oh , I will . There is no telling what might happen .
 Yeah , there is .
 You know , there 's nothing wrong helping some woman 's kid get through their S. A. T. ' s .
 Hey , I got to hand it to Raj , He found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party .
 It 's not bad . Unless you compare it to a train ; then it stinks .
 Are you drinking whiskey ? Indeed .
 If I 'm to participate in the social convention that is the stag night , then I must embrace all its components : including tobacco , swear words , and yes , alcohol .
 Jeepers ! That 's yucky .
 Whoa , it 's a little early to start dropping J- bombs , don 't you think ?
 Hey , you guys . Oh , hey , Wil . Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard .
 Well , it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei 's house .
 I 'm confused . I thought since our reconciliation , I was your friend in this group .
 Oh , I 'm friends with Howard too . Oh !
 I guess you 're just friends with anybody .
 Aah !
 Hey , uh , Leonard ... things are a little tight at the comic book store .
 I might need some help covering my share of the check .
 Oh , yeah , no worries .
 And maybe a few bucks for the valet . Oh , all right .
 And gas money to get home .
 Yeah , sure . Great . You know what ?
 This is my grandfather 's watch . Oh .
 18- carat gold , got it in Europe during the war . Wow , that 's very nice .
 Mm- hmm . 100 bucks and it 's yours .
 Hey , everybody !
 The bachelor boy has arrived ! ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he 's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪
 Yes , yes , yes . He 's a jolly good fellow . What time do the strippers arrive ?
 Actually , Barry , we 're not going to have strippers tonight .
 Ah , then what the frig did I get 200 dollars in singles out for ?
 You want to buy a watch ?
 This is Maid of Honor Amy Farrah Fowler , bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day .
 Let 's check in with a beautiful , radiant young woman , and her friend who 's about to get married .
 Ladies , can you tell us what you 're doing ?
 Um , these are gift bags we 're going to put in the hotel rooms of our out- of- town guests .
 This is a map of Pasadena . This is a list of local restaurants .
 And then , for Howie 's relatives , we have antihistamines , antacids , and medicine for diarrhea and constipation .
 Yeah , we labeled them " stop and go . "
 All right , pivoting to the big question :
 Bernadette , on your wedding night you 'll be consummating your marriage .
 What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife ?
 Amy , please .
 Keeping in mind that whoever 's on top may set the tone for the marriage .
 Okay , show 's over .
 Hey , they may conceive a child on their wedding night . Don 't you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened ?
 I don 't care . Ask her things like " Are you going to take Howard 's name ? "
 Not " Who 's going to sit on who . "
 I 've actually been thinking I 'm going to hyphenate :
 Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski- Wolowitz . Nice .
 You know , you should totally get
 Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski- Wolowitz . com before someone snaps it up .
 Howard already took care of it .
 Plus , he set up our beautiful wedding Web site with cute little facts about our family histories .
 Do you know , for a while in Poland , my family and his family were neighbors . Oh , that 's cool .
 No , it 's not . I 'll explain it to you later .
 May I have your attention , please ?
 We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz . Hear ! Hear !
 And , apparently , Wil Wheaton 's best friend .
 Sheldon ...
 Talk to the hand .
 Does anyone have any words they 'd like to say about our man of the evening ? I do .

 As is the tradition , I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humor at Howard 's expense .
 Prepare to have your ribs tickled ...
 Howard ... I always thought you 'd be the last one of us to ever get married , because you are so short and unappealing . Am I right ?

 Let 's see here .
 Oh , seriously though , Howard , you 're actually one of the most intelligent people I know .
 And that 's a zinger , because you 're not .
 I 've always thought that you 'd make someone a fine husband someday .
 Assuming you 'd be able to get the parts , and develop the engineering skills to assemble them , which I don 't see as likely .
 Hacha !
 Okay ...
 Let me see here .
 Okay , kidding aside --
 Howard , you are a good friend . And I wish you nothing but happiness . Bazinga , I don 't !

 Sheldon ...
 Doubleazinga ! I do !
 Good luck following that .
 So , Howard Wolowitz tying the knot . Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind .
 He was a wild one . Well , I guess we all kind of were .
 I remember this one time , I was with this girl at the beach .
 We were in the ocean and we started making out . I know , it was crazy .
 I wasn 't even wearing my Aquasocks .
 Then ...
 Nobody cares , Hofstadter .
 Wrap it up . Right .
 To Howard .
 To Howard .
 I totally had sex in the ocean .
 Okay , I 'll go . Howard , when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together ,
 I can 't help but get a little choked up . I mean ... look at you .
 You have everything . Look at me .
 I 'm 37 .
 I sleep in the back of a comic book store , and I have the bone density of an 80- year- old man .
 To Howard .
 Yeah , to Howard . Yes ...
 - Um , uh , who 's next ?
 - I 'll go .
 Howard , I 'm gonna say something to you that everybody 's thinking but no one has the courage to say out loud .
 When you invite a man to a bachelor party , the implication is , there will be strippers .
 Maybe not completely nude , but at least pasties and G- strings . That 's not unreasonable . - Hear , hear .
 - Hear , hear .
 Okay , uh , anybody else ? Huh ?
 No ?
 Okay , it all comes down to me , the best man .
 Ooh !
 This grasshopper is kicking my ass- hopper .
 Okay , okay , when I first came to this country , I- I didn 't know how to behave or how to dress , or what was cool ...
 I was pretty lonely .
 But then I met Howard , and suddenly , my life changed , because we could be lonely together .
 This man became my whole world .
 Yeah , nice speech , Francine .
 I 'm not done , but thank you .
 I think back .... ... to all the good times we had , like , uh , when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets .
 I told him I 'm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin .
 She was my second cousin .
 And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually . Ba- da- bazinga !
 Oh ... oh , yeah , and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle .
 Of all the " Howard humping hookers " stories , that one 's my favorite !
 Okay , buddy , that 's it . Sit down .
 Oh , oh , what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic- con ?
 Don 't remember . Please sit down .
 The only threesome I 've ever had in my life , and I 'm proud to say it was with this man right here .
 Oh , please shut up .
 Oh , oh , don 't get me wrong , nothing happened with me and Howard .
 There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us .
 Oh , Internet , this is so going all over you .
 Jeepers , I 'm drunk .
 Thank you for picking us up . There 's a warning , right there , on the scotch bottle .
 You cannot be operatin ' heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this , laddie !
 Funny . You boys have a nice time ?
 Yeah , it was great .
 Low- key , like I promised . No hanky- panky , no strippers . Just the guys telling jokes .
 That 's nice .
 How about you ? Did you have a fun night ?
 Yeah , we , uh , made gift bags , had wine , and then went online and saw this .
 Of all the " Howard humping hookers " stories , that one 's my favorite .
 You know , we 're not that far from my apartment . If you stop the car , I can walk from here .
 You ain 't goin ' anywhere , Threeway .
 Bernadette , listen ... You lied to me .
 You said you told me about all the girls you 've been with , but you never mentioned your cousin , the prostitute or Raj !
 Seriously , you don 't even have to stop the car .
 Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat- roll into the street .
 Okay , just to set the record straight , I didn 't hire the prostitute , she was a gift from him .
 Shame on you , Raj . That is not how we treat women in this country .
 Don 't you try and blame this on him .
 - Thank you , Bernadette . - Zip it , pervert !
 I don 't know what I 'm going to do .
 I 'm supposed to marry Howard in a couple weeks and I 'm not sure I even know who the man is anymore .
 I 'm curious what 's bothering you most : the borderline incest , the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children 's cartoon ?
 Amy , remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn 't ?
 Right .
 - And that was ...
 - Not .
 When I first met Howard , he seemed so innocent to me , just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother .
 Well , if that 's what you like , I 'll take you to the comic book store -- the place is full of 'em .
 Wait a minute . You set me up with Howard . Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into ?

 Well , a little . You hear stuff ...
 Why didn 't you tell me
 Well , I was gonna , but I didn 't think it would go past the first date .
 Then , when it did , I thought for sure it wouldn 't go past you meeting his mother .
 Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together . I mean , the warning signs were there -- this is really on you .
 God ! I thought you were my friend .
 I don 't think that was helpful .
 Hi , Bernie , it 's me again . Please call me back .
 Dude , I am so sorry .
 It 's not your fault , it 's mine . I did all that stuff , not you .
 Actually , you did do one of them together .
 Here .
 What is this ? You 're upset .
 The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage . No , but what is it ?
 Chicken broth . It seemed culturally appropriate .
 Also , there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it 's been bothering me for the last eight years ...
 So , as they say , two birds .
 I don 't know what my next move is .
 Well , Howard , I don 't know much about women ...
 - Yeah ? - No , uh , that , that 's it .
 I don 't know much about women .
 Raj , you got anything ?
 I 've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic- Con.
 I 'm not calling the girl from Comic- con .
 All right . More Sailor Moon for me .
 I just threw up the bachelor party .
 Please come out , Bernadette . Let 's talk through this .
 No , leave me alone .
 Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine . Do you have a cousin who you find attractive ?
 Amy .
 Hey , you introduced him to the sleazebag . I 'm just trying to clean up your mess .
 Oh , hi .
 Hi .
 I need to talk to Bernadette .
 Well , I don 't think she wants to talk to anyone right now .
 All right , well , could you at least give her a message ?
 Yeah , sure , I guess .
 Tell her I 'm really sorry . And if she doesn 't want to marry me , I get it .
 But what I really want her to know is the guy that she 's disgusted by , is the guy that I 'm disgusted by , too .
 But that guy doesn 't exist anymore ; he 's gone . And the reason is because of her .
 So , if this relationship is over ,
 let her know that she made me a better man , and tell her thank you .
 Oh , my God , Howard . That 's the most beautiful thing I 've ever heard . And it came out of you .
 Howie ?
 Penny has a message for you .
 I heard . Your voice , not unlike your mother 's , travels through walls .
 Do you want me to go ?
 No . Come here .
 I 'm still really mad at you . I get that .
 Is there anything else about your past I should know ?
 Couple things , but , you know , most of them happened overseas . I 'll tell you later .
 Okay .
 So , is the wedding still on ?
 Yeah , the wedding 's still on .
 Oh , thank God . I 'm still a maid of honor !
 Oh , what the hell .
 This is kind of hot .
 Hello .
 What 's with the robe ? I 'm gonna have sex with you right here , right now , on that washing machine .
 No , you 're not . Come on , please .
 If you want to do something , you can help me fold this sheet .
 Folding a sheet in my underwear , still pretty crazy .
