 It 's such a great house . Thanks .
 Of course , you 'll qualify for a VA loan , you lucky son of a gun .
 Sounds like a pretty fair trade for risking his life for his country .
 So , uh , you ever killed anyone ?
 Well , Nick , my first time downrange , I started as a gunner in Ramadi .
 After BRC , I got deployed with 1st Recon to find a terror cell so deeply embedded with civilians that we couldn 't tell the difference , so what do you think ?
 Excuse us .
 Was that really necessary ?
 Who asks that to somebody they just met ?
 Oh .
 You ready to head out ? Spence , it 's not even dark .
 The plan was to stay an hour . We can 't miss the fireworks .
 I 'll look bad in front of my boss . All right , sundown 's at 2100 hours .
 Leave at 2120 ?
 Fine .
 Uh , the kids are out of sparklers , so I 'm gonna make a quick run with Nick .
 I 'll go with you .
 I 'll be five minutes . Okay ?
