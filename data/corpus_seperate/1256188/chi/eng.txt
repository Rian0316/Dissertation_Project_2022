 Kids , the day you get married is supposed To bethe happiest day of your life ,
 The perfect ending to a perfect love story .
 My wedding -- at least my first wedding -- Didn 't go so well .
 It 's funny looking back on it now .
 I was so sure stella was the one .
 And when she left me , I was so devastated .
 But you guys got me through it .
 And now the painful part 's over .
 I 've come out the other side a little bit stronger . You know , i ...
 I hardly even think about her anymore .
 That 's what time does , I guess .
 Ted , the wedding was yesterday .
 It 's been 24 hours .
 I know . And this is me , moving on .
 A great new chapter Of my life began today , And we 're gonna celebrate .
 Right now , we need two things . We need kool , and we need the gang .
 It 's jukebox time , huh ?
 I look at that young man Popping and locking his way over to the jukebox ,
 And I think to myself , You know ...
 Maybe stella made the right call .
 Ow , pain .
 How is he dancing right now ?
 He should ... he should be smashing up Stella 's car with a sledgehammer .
 Hypothetical .
 Ted isn 't pretending to be happy .
 Ted really is happy .
 He never wanted to get married In the first place .
 Ted just pulled off The greatest train dodge since stand by me .
 Well , not the first kid , but the other kids .
 No , he is in bad shape .
 What 's up ?
 Really bad shape .
 And we need to be there for him .
 But as much as my friend really want to be there for me ,
 I was ... by all the appearances ... Fine .
 Hey, buddy Want to hang out ?
 Guys , I 'm fine .
 Hey , pal , you want to have a catch ?
 I 'm fine .
 Hey , kiddo .
 Barney , I 'm fine .
 This is not necessary , And it 's actually kind of weird .
 No offense , ladies .
 I did not realize you 'd be home .
 Ladies , to the stairwell .



 Finally , after two weeks , The inevitable emotions boiled over .
 Hey , you guys want to get some dinner ?
 Oh , shut up .
 I 'm sorry , sweetie .
 It 's just , ted , You 've been through something traumatic ,
 And we 're trying to be there for you
 As friends , but you 're not letting us , And it 's pissing us off , you selfish bitch .
 Sorry .
 Look , we 're just worried That you 're not dealing with this whole stella thing .
 Do you remember when lily left me ?
 You remember how I held in my feelings ?
 I ... Miss ... Her so much .
 Yeah , dude , you were a rock .
 Well , I should have been even worse , okay ?
 I should have gotten mad .
 I should have taken your advice And set all of lily 's stuff on fire .
 Oh , nice -- thanks , ted .
 But I didn 't , and I think that that 's why It took me so long to get better .
 So , now , ted ...
 I want you to explode .
 Release the berserker . Okay , ready ?
 Now ! I 'm good .
 No .
 Guys , get off his back . He 's happy .
 Listen , if ted were married right now , He 'd be married ,
 He 'd be living in new jersey , And he 'd be married .
 He 's fine . Now , let 's eat . How about flat michael 's ?
 No , that 's 44th and lex . Can 't do it .
 Why not ?
 It 's too close to stella 's gym . Might run into her .
 Anywhere else , though .
 Okay , um , how about hurley 's ?
 Right between stella 's office and her dry cleaners . No , sir .
 Well , what about meatloaf charlie 's ?
 Two blocks from stella 's mother 's hairdressers .
 Well , geez , ted , is there anywhere In manhattan we can go to dinner ?
 Of course . Check this out .
 What you got there , ted ?
 A little reference map I made for myself .
 A new york guide to places you might run into stella zinman .
 Red areas Are places to avoid .
 White areas are safe .
 Blue is water .
 That is just ridiculous . Well , water is blue .
 You can 't live that way .
 She leaves you at the altar , And you 're the one avoiding her ?
 Yes , I 'm avoiding her . What 's the big deal ?
 That 's how we do it .
 Who 's we , gutless weenies ?
 Uh , no , " we " is people from the great state of ohio .
 When life gives us pain , We buckeyes take that pain and we push it down .
 And if the pain starts To come up again , We push more pain down on top of it .
 Why confront something when you can avoid it , right ?
 All I have to do Is never see stella again , And I 'll live a long , happy life .
 Now , who wants to get something to eat ?
 Oh , somebody just told me About a tapas place that 's in the white zone .
 Great . Let 's go there .
 You ready to order ?
 Uh , not quite yet .
 Oh , can we get some of those almonds for the table ?
 Certainly .
 Nice call , lily . This place looks great .
 Who told you about it ?
 You know , I don 't remember .
 What ? i just remembered ...
 Oh , my god , oh , my god .
 Okay , okay , just be cool .
 We 're just gonna have to deal with this .
 Everyone ... Follow my lead .
 Oh , you 're kidding . Is he serious ?
 I am not getting under thisable .
 I 'd maybe get under that table .
 She 's turning around .
 Think , think , think .
 Everyone , just stay here . I 'm gonna go take a look .
 Marshall , go take a look .
 And will you need utensils ?
 No , I 'm just going straight home .
 She 's placing an order to go .
 Did she seem happy ? Did she say anything about me ?
 I don 't even care .
 Where are those almonds ?
 Gosh , where would ted 's nuts be ?
 Hey , why don 't you check the vise in stella 's garage .
 Go yell at her .
 Ted , you may be from ohio , But you live in new york now .
 We don 't push down our feelings in new york .
 We take our feelings and we shove them In somebody else 's face !
 Oh , spare me , lily .
 You 'd be doing the same thing If you were in this situation .
 Thats out of rageous .
 There is not a person on earth I would hide under a table from .
 Oh , really , not a single person ?
 Not even ... Gasser ?
 How dare you mention that name to me .
 Who 's gasser ?
 He 's the last person I 'd want to see walk through that door .
 Michael sasser .
 He 's a guy I went to high school with .
 Michael sat next to me in freshman biology .
 He had been a bit of a loser all through middle school ,
 But the summer before ninth grade , He grew 12 inches and joined the baseball team .
 He was right on the precipice Of becoming one of the cool kids .
 Until one day ...
 Oh , lily , we 've all been there .
 When you 've ripped one , it 's not pretty .
 What did you do ?
 Are you kidding ? This was ninth grade .
 I only had one choice .
 Oh , my god , sasser . Fart much ?
 No , it wasn 't me .
 It was her . Oh , as if , sasser . More like gasser .
 Gasser ! Gasser ! Gasser !
 No . Gasser ! Gasser !
 Gasser !
 Gasser !
 I 'm on the baseball team .
 I- i 'm cool . Gasser !
 Gasser ! The nickname gasser stuck .
 He got teased so much , Eventually he had to change schools .
 Kids are awesome .
 I 've always felt awful about that .
 But if gasser -- michael -- Walked in right now , as hard as it would be ,
 I would go up to gasser -- michael -- And I would resolve things between us .
 Right , clear the air , as it were .
 Oh , man .
 Those don 't come around often .
 Y 'all are welcome .
 Hey , are you guys okay ?
 Oh , yeah . We 're just gonna be eating down here if that 's okay .
 Well , here 's your almonds .
 Oh , thanks ... You guys have any specials today ?
 Ted , this is ludicrous .
 Ted , I am a person who ...
 Well , let 's just face it .
 There are a lot of people I don 't want to see --
 People of the " chicks I banged " persuasion --
 But if any of them were to walk in here ,
 I would stand up , And I would look them right in the eye .
 Some of them for the very first time .
 Really , you wouldn 't hide from anyone ?
 Not even , say ... Becca delucci ?
 You son of a bitch .
 Who 's becca delucci ?
 Do you mind ?
 So , who is becca delucci ?
 Becca is just this girl who lives upstate .
 I used to visit her now and again .
 Mm- hmm , where exactly upstate , barney ?
 Bedford hills federal penitentiary .
 And yes , the visits were of a conjugal nature .
 No way , really ?
 Really . And what I had with becca was a perfect relationship .
 She was only allowed , by law , to call me once a week .
 If she ever got clingy , The armed guards stopped her .
 And I never had to pay for dinner .
 Well , that 's not true .
 I pay taxes . Then again , I guess we all paid for dinner . Thanks a lot , guys .
 Anyway , the last time I visited , I kind of screwed things up .
 I know it 's hard , baby , But I 'm in a prison , too .
 A prison of my own heart .
 Is that room ready yet or what ? Can we ... ? Tick- tock .
 Barney , you 're the only thing That 's keeping me going here .
 That 's what I 'm here for , baby . I 'm your rock . I 'm ...
 Oh , my god .
 Hello , strange .
 Barney stinson , attorney at law .
 Let 's talk about getting you off .
 Oh , hell , no !
 Now I get letters from becca and she 's all ,
 " i 'm coming to get you the day I get out of here .
 I 'm gonna hang your eyes from my rearview mirror . "
 Women , huh ?
 See ? You 're scared of becca . Lily 's scared of gasser .
 We 're staying under the table .
 We don 't have to .
 Stella 's gone . Oh , my gosh .
 There , all done , And that 's how we do it ohio style .
 Problem showed up . We avoided it .
 It went away . Now we can enjoy our meal in peace and ...
 She 's back .
 Ted , we all think that you need -- Wait , where 's barney ?
 Ted , We all think that you need to go talk to her .
 I don 't . What ?
 Yeah , if t last person I wanted to see Walked through the door , I wouldn 't say a damn word .
 Really ? And who 's that ?
 My father .
 You guys , that other table is off the hook .
 What are we talking about ?
 Robin 's dad .
 I haven 't spoken to him in three years And I don 't intend to start now .
 Why ?
 It goes back to the day I was born .
 You give me my son now . Push .
 Oh , no ... Oh , no .
 He wanted a son And the fact that I was a girl didn 't change his plan .
 What do you mean ?
 My full legal name is robin charles scherbatsky , jr .
 And it only gets worse from there .
 When I was eight , he took me hunting for the first time .
 I don 't want to shoot a deer .
 Nonsense , r . J. Shooting deer Is the noblest of pursuits .
 But they 're cute .
 You said the same thing about our rabbits .
 Remember how delicious they were ?
 Over the years , as my body developed ...
 Whoa , hold on a sec .
 Sorry , go on .
 It became harder and harder for him to pretend I was a boy .
 The lowest moment came when I turned 14 .
 My peewee hockey team had just won the squamish invitational
 And everyone came back to my house to celebrate .
 You lads availed yourself splendidly Out there on the ice .
 Splendidly .
 You go on outside .
 I 'll come back with an assortment Of soft drinks and american pretzels .
 I can 't believe You missed that last empty- netter , you hoser .
 You 're the hoser .
 No , you 're the hoser .
 What are you doing ?
 You 're teammates , hockey players .
 Teammates don 't kiss !
 Hockey players don 't kiss !
 Oh , my god . I have no son .
 Oh , you poor thing .
 To have to grow up in canada With america right there .
 That ... Sucks about your dad , robin , But congratulations on that game .
 And kyle and I weren 't even doing anything serious .
 We only went to the blue line .
 The blue line ?
 Yeah , you know how when you 're a kid , You put everything into hockey terms ?
 The blue line is kissing ; the red line is getting naked ;
 And I think " in the crease " speaks for itself .
 Anyway , after that , My relationship with my dad pretty much went north .
 I moved in with my mom , Grew my hair out , became a canadian pop star .
 You know , normal teen stuff .
 Don 't you think it would feel better To talk to him about all this ?
 No , that 's the point . It wouldn 't solve anything .
 It 's in the past . It 's done .
 I mean , what would I even say to him ? " i wish you hadn 't raised me as a boy " ? " i wish you hadn 't taught me how to hunt
 " and fish and smoke cigars and drink scotch
 " because that 's not what girls do . " and you know the reason I throw like a girl , dad , Is because I am a girl . "
 Wow , you held onto that for a long time , huh ?
 Yeah .
 It really messed you up .
 Yeah . That sucks .
 I 'm sorry . That 's hot .
 And then I realized ...
 All of my friends were haunted , But there was a difference between my ghost and theirs .
 It wasn 't too late for me .
 I 'm gonna go talk to her .
 She 's gone . I 'm going after her .
 Whoo . Go , go .
 There she goes !

 Okay , I see her . She 's two cabs ahead on the right .
 Just stay with her , okay ?
 Finally . Finally , you 're doing this .
 You 're going to confront her .
 Yes , I am going to confront her . Yeah .
 This is so exciting . Totally .
 What are you going to say ?
 I 'm gonna say , " stella , I 'm sorry things didn 't work out . "
 Ay , caramba . No !
 Yes . We 're going to talk about this like adults .
 She can tell me her side and ...
 I 'm going to listen . Probably
 Should have done a little more of that before .
 Driver , can you run us into the nearest lamppost ?
 Everyone , buckle up . Not you , ted .
 Ted , ted , You got to get mad right now .
 Come on . Dig deep .
 Dude , come on . This isn 't about me waving my arms , Stamping my feet , and getting really mad .
 This is about stella and i Finally communicating .
 I mean , clearly , that was ...
 Stella hated star wars .
 She lied to you . Search your feelings , ted .
 You know it to be true . Well , that 's her business .
 Come on , ted .
 She left you at the altar .
 I don 't understand !
 Ted , in the name of all that is sacred ...
 Wait , wait , wait ! Where is she going ?
 Her cab just missed the turn for the lincoln tunnel .
 Why would anybody Buy takeout food And bring it all the way back to new jersey anyway ?
 Maybe she 's going to her office .
 No .
 The waiter asked her , " will you need utensils ? "
 And then she said , " nah , I 'm just going straight home . "
 But if she 's going home , why are we still heading ... ? Oh , my god .
 Tony lives downtown . " home " is tony 's apartment .
 She was going to make me move to new jersey And then she moves into the city with tony ? !
 Son of a bitch ! Finally .
 Finally , buddy .
 I am so angry right now ! I know , and I love it !
 Yeah , that is awesome !
 Sir , we 'd be happy to cover The cost of that window crank .
 I love angry ted !
 So do i !
 Get it out , baby . Let it out .
 Oh ... She 's stopping .
 Oh , it is on . It is on !
 Yes , ted . Go get her , buddy !
 Go get rid of your demons !
 My leg is asleep !
 Okay , wa- wa- wait .
 Wait , hold on . Lily , What are you doing ?
 All right , hold on .
 Look , ted , It 's great that you 're angry right now .
 It sure is . Yes . Yeah !
 And that you 're finally dealing With this , but you only get one shot here .
 Let 's just take a beat and , And think about what you 're going to say .
 Oh , I know exactly what I 'm gonna say .
 You picked the wrong guy . Ted .
 You picked the wrong guy .
 You made a really , really , really bad choice .
 What were you thinking ?
 That guy ? Are you kidding me ?
 Have you learned nothing in the last eight years ?
 You 're just gonna regret this . You know that , right ?
 You are going to regret this , And now there is nothing you can do about it Because it 's too late .
 All you can do now is go up there And start your crappy , disappointing life
 That will never be nearly as happy As the one you could have had with me .
 Good- bye .
 Ted , wait .
 Look , stella , I am not here to win you back .
 I am here Because I need to know that you know You made the biggest mistake of your life .
 I know .
 Good .
 That 's what I 'm gonna say . Oh ...
 Cold- blooded .
 Yeah , that 's good . Go say that .
 Thanks .
 So I got out of the cab , ready to say all of that stuff , Ready to explode , but then ...
 Mommy ! H- h- hey . Hey .
 It all just went away .
 And that was it .
 In that moment , I wasn 't angry anymore .
 I could see stella was meant to be with tony .
 Kids , you may think your only choices Are to swallow your anger Or throw it in someone 's face . there is a third option
 You can just let it go ,
 And only when you do that is it really gone , And you can move forward .
 And that , kids , was the perfect ending to a perfect love story .
 It just wasn 't mine .
 Mine was still out there waiting for me .
