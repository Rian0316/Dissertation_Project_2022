 Well , we 've covered football and grandkids ...
 Maybe we 've run out of stuff to talk about .
 We forgot about your ex- husband . The one you 're dating .

 Well , I know not to piss him off during a hailstorm .
 Well , did he tell you that I was naked when he locked me out ?
 What were you doing naked with a golf club in a hailstorm ?
 Ah , you know , it was the '70s .
 I was just calling to let you know I read your paper .
 The masses for your neutrinos are impossible .
 I completely rewrote the whole thing from scratch .
 I know credits are usually listed alphabetically , but I 'm completely fine with my name going second .
 I 'm not putting your name on it in any way . - Grant Linkletter .
 - Dr. Sturgis has stolen my work and is using it in his own paper .
 How dare you accuse me of plagiarism !
 I don 't want to see you in my class anymore .
 I see , Dr. Sturgis .
 Yes , that is unforgivable behavior .
 Okay .
 Bye .
 Did he apologize ? No . He is very upset with you .
 Well , I 'm upset with him .
 That doesn 't excuse you from trying to get him in trouble by calling Dr. Linkletter .
 Who else was I supposed to tattle to ?
 I doubt his mother 's still alive .
 Sheldon , I understand why you 're upset , but you still owe him an apology .
 Then you don 't understand .
 Well , for now , it sounds like you two could use a little quiet time .
 Fine .
 I 'll switch over to Dr. Linkletter 's class . He 's a foot taller than Sturgis and can reach more of the chalkboard .
 What I meant was ... maybe it 's time to take a break from your college classes .


 What ?
 Why ? I 've gotten straight As .
 I know you 're smart enough for college .
 I 'm just not sure you 're mature enough .
 Well , it appears you 've backed me into a corner .
 I would throw a tantrum right now , but that would just prove your point .
 Where are you going ?
 To play with my trains .
 Which may sound immature , but it 's a hobby many old men enjoy .







 I 'm the only cheerleader you should be looking at .
 Oh .
 Hi .
 Oh , I was trying to find you .
 - Just wanted to wish you a good game . - Thank you . - I 'm gonna be cheering for you .
 - Great .
 Unless I catch you looking at someone else .
 Then you 'll regret it .

 I 'm not kidding .

 Hi , George .
 Oh , hey , Ms. Hutchins .
 I don 't think I 've ever seen you at a game before .
 Well , uh , it 's Friday , and I promised my therapist
 - I 'd try one new thing a week .
 - And you picked football .
 Good for you . I don 't suppose Sheldon 's here ?
 Nah , he doesn 't much care for outdoor sports .
 Or sports .
 Or the outdoors .
 I was hoping I 'd have someone to sit with . - Ah , sorry .
 - That 's okay .
 It was my fault for letting myself feel hope .
 You 're welcome to watch from the sidelines .
 Watching life go by from the sidelines is kind of my thing .
 Thanks .
 Hey , heads up !


 Oh , my God .
 Are you okay ?
 I don 't think so .
 Call an ambulance .
 Don 't worry , we 're gonna get you taken care of .
 If I die , tell my therapist I hate him .
 And who says you have to be mature to go to college ?
 I 've seen Animal House . - You have ?
 - Well , I 've seen the poster .
 Those people are not college material .
 Moon Pie , I know you don 't like to hear this , but there are some things in life that can only be learned in time .

 So you must have learned them all , huh ?
 Get out of my house .
 Hang in there .
 I 'm hangin ' .
 Hey , this will be quite a story to tell your grandkids , huh ?
 I live alone . I 'm single .
 I don 't think grandkids are in the picture .
 Oh . Well , I ... I got a wife , kids .
 It 's ...
 It 's overrated .
 And then my mother said
 I wasn 't mature enough for college .
 Can you believe that ?
 Absolutely .
 So you 're on their side , too ?
 I 'm Vietnamese .
 In my culture , until your parents die ,
 - you 're basically a baby .
 - Really ?
 My grandmother still treats my dad like a child .
 At dinner , he can 't sit until she sits , and he can 't speak until he 's spoken to .
 Well , I 'm glad I 'm not Vietnamese .
 It 's not as fun as I make it look .
 Mm .
 Well , you can 't bring her home to an empty apartment .
 Bring her here , and we 'll look after her until she 's back on her feet .
 - You sure ? - Of course . We 'll set her up in Georgie 's room .
 Thanks , Mare .
 See you in a bit .
 Hey , George .
 It 's real nice of you , taking care of her like this .
 Well , it was kinda my fault .
 Kinda ?
 It was all your fault . Bye .
 Hey . Hey .
 How 'd we do ?
 - You didn 't miss anything .
 - That bad ?
 I can safely say you saw the best hit of the night .
 Whew .
 How 's she doing ?
 Well , not bad .
 Could be worse .
 A little whiplash , couple of bruised ribs , broken arm ... and collarbone .
 But that 's it .
 Pretty funny how you jumped out of the way and let her get clobbered .
 I did not jump out of the way !
 Oh , yeah , you did .
 They got you on tape .
 Okay , fine .
 But that was pure instinct .
 Besides , she shouldn 't have been standing on the sidelines .
 Why was she there ?
 I told her she could . Oh , man , you must feel terrible .
 Yeah , of course I do .
 I mean , it 's all on you .
 You done ?
 Oh- ho- ho , baby , I 'm just getting started .

 Oh , you poor dear . Come on in .
 Thanks .
 I hope I 'm not putting you out .
 Of course not . Hi , Sheldon .

 Can you believe my mother said I can 't go to college ?

 So you just put her in my room without consulting me ?
 Consulting you ?
 Who cares what you think ?
 Well , I ain 't gonna sleep on the couch .
 It 's just for a few nights until she can take care of herself .
 Can I at least stay at Meemaw 's ?
 If you promise not to come back .
 Why you got to be so mean to me ?
 It just feels right .
 And then after Dr. Sturgis incorporated my math , he refused to give me a coauthor credit .
 Sheldon , she doesn 't want to hear about that .
 It 's okay .
 So , when your bones broke , did you hear a crunch ?
 No . - Did my dad have to give you mouth- to- mouth ?
 - No .
 I don 't know how my mom kisses him .

 Next up , we have this rose ..
 Who buys this crap ?
 Me , after three beers .
 I mean , look at this damn thing .
 What was I thinking ?
 Can I ask you a personal question ?
 You 're not in my will . It 's about my girlfriend .
 Uh- oh .
 Uh , nothing bad .
 It 's just , I 've been seeing Jana for a while now , and I like her fine ... but it feels like she 's getting more serious than I want to be .

 Georgie , until you 're married , you are not tied down to anybody .
 You just go ahead and do whatever you want .
 Play the field . Have some fun .
 Interesting . That 's what Dale said , too .
 Oh , did he ?
 Yeah .
 My boyfriend ?
 Yeah .
 If I don 't go to college , what am I supposed to do ?
 Spend all my days in high school ?
 How sad is that ?
 Pretty sad .
 You always did get me .
 Sounds like you 're feeling misunderstood .
 I am ... by Dr. Sturgis , my mother , and possibly the entire Vietnamese culture .
 Do you understand that I 'm in a little bit of pain right now ?
 Oh , I 'm sorry . I should be exhibiting compassion .
 Aw . Wait , I can do better . Aw .
 Nailed it .
 It 's time for your pain pill . Be careful .
 You could become addicted and lose your job .
 Which is all you have .
 Get out of here .
 Thank you .
 You- you comfortable ?
 Can I get you anything else ?
 No .
 I- I 'm okay .
 You 've been so kind to welcome me into your home .
 Well , it 's the least we could do .
 It 's so nice to be around a family like this .
 I 've been alone for ... so long .
 Honestly , if it weren 't for the cats , I 'd have no one .
 Oh , wait . The cats ! I abandoned Edgar and Allan .
 Edgar and Allan ? Poe ran away .
 Would you please go feed them and tell them I love them ?
 Uh ... any chance this could wait till morning ?
 I guess .
 Where you off to ?
 Cats !
 So you think he 's seeing somebody else ?
 I don 't think I should be talking about this . - He 's my boss .
 - Well , he 's my boyfriend , so spill it .
 It 's weird when old people say " boyfriend " .
 Fine . My lover .
 Well , that 's worse .
 Then talk ! The only woman I 've really seen him with
 - is his ex- wife .
 - Oh , yeah , but he hates her .
 Don 't seem like it .
 What do you mean by that ?
 - They seem friendly .
 - How friendly ?
 - I don 't know . He 's nice to her .
 - How nice ? ! Do you mind ?
 I 'm trying to watch this .
 Now look at this little guy ...






 Son of a bitch !
 Here !
 Edgar !
 Or Allan .
 Whichever the hell one you are .
 They ever leave the store together ?
 Can I please just go to bed ?
 Just answer the damn question .
 I feel like I 'm gonna get fired for this .
 Georgie , don 't worry .
 Anything you say is gonna stay right here .
 But you lie all the time .
 I learned to lie from you .
 See what a special bond we have ?
 Now answer the damn question !


 Why were you gone for so long ?
 I don 't want to talk about it .


 - Whoa .
 - What 's that ?
 It 's a ghost detector that came in my cereal box .
 It 's just a piece of paper .
 Then why did it move in my hand ?
 From perspiration . Or ghosts .
 Mornin ' . Did you check on Ms. Hutchins ?
 Is she still alive ?
 Of course she is .
 Why ?
 No reason .
 I 'm gonna go eat my breakfast with her .
 Sheldon , just let her rest .
 It 's okay .
 She enjoys my company .
 Also , she understands what I 'm going through with Dr. Sturgis .
 Excuse me .
 I am just trying to help you grow up to be a functional adult .
 Me ?
 This one 's looking for cereal ghosts .
 Looking for and found 'em .
 I don 't care . You are not ready for college .
 If it were up to you , I 'd still be in grade school .
 If you think this is mature behavior , it isn 't !
 Being a mom 's hard , isn 't it ?
 Sometimes .
 If you ever want to talk about it ,
 I 'm here for you .
 Ooh , it 's moving again .
 You 're so lucky .
 You 're gonna have to walk me through that .
 Well , you don 't have anyone in your house telling you what you can or can 't do .
 Right , Sheldon .
 I don 't have anyone . I just said that .
 Are you becoming a drug addict already ?
 Mornin ' .
 Got you some Shipley 's Do- Nuts and coffee .
 What happened to your face ?
 Oh .
 Uh ... either Edgar or Allan .
 Oh , that was Edgar . He can be a rascal .

 Good mornin ' .
 Mornin ' .
 Did you sleep good ?
 Yeah .
 Want some pancakes ?
 Sure .
 Just one more question about Dale .
 Bye .



 There we go .
 Nice little bite- size pieces .
 Thanks , George , but I- I think I can manage .
 No , no .
 My pleasure .
 He feels so guilty , he 'll do anything you ask him .
 - That 's enough from you .
 - He bought me an Easy- Bake Oven when he closed the car door on my thumb .
 Unlike my mother , who feels no guilt after hurting her children .
 How dare you .
 I am trying to keep you safe until such a time as you can make adult decisions .
 - I can make them now .
 - Hey , hey . We have a guest .
 Let 's pretend like we like each other .
 Mare , do your grace thing . ♪ I love the melody ... ♪
 You okay with Mexican ?
 Oh , yeah . Terrific .
 All right . Now , I got Tums in the glovebox for the ride home .
 Great . So , you talk to June lately ?

 Uh , not in a couple of days .
 Why ?
 Oh , no reason .
 I was just kind of thinking about calling her myself .
 I mean , if you 're okay with that .
 You want to call my ex- wife , go ahead .
 Call her .
 Well , I wouldn 't want you to feel uncomfortable . Yeah , you would .
 Yeah , I would .
 I think it 's nice that y 'all get along as well as you do .
 Mm- hmm .
 Where are we going with this ?
 Oh , just nothing . Makin ' conversation .
 Okay . You sleeping with her ?
 Lord , no .
 She 's my ex- wife . Come on .
 Oh , my gosh , what kind of sicko sleeps with their ex- wife ?
 Where is this coming from ?
 Are you jealous ?
 No .
 I 'd just like to know , you know , what kind of relationship we 're in .
 I mean , are we seeing other people or what ?
 Connie Tucker , are you asking me to go steady ?
 You know what I 'm asking , jackass . All right , all right , all right .
 You listen to me .
 Now , I 'm 72 years old . Do you think I have enough stamina to go playing around with other women ?
 You saying the only reason you 're seeing me is you 're too old and tired to see anybody else ?
 Give me the Tums .



 I could kiss you forever .
 Uh , that 's kind of a long time .
 You got somewhere else to be ?
 No .
 It 's just that , eventually , we 're gonna get hungry .
 Why do I keep getting the feeling you 're not into this ?
 Oh , I am into this .
 But ?
 I mean , we 're real young , and who knows what 's gonna happen ?
 I know .
 And you should , too .
 Don 't feel bad .
 I don 't know lots of stuff . So , as long as we 're on the subject , are you seeing anybody else ?

 No .
 How about that nutty professor ?
 We 're just friends .
 Yeah , well , that 's what June and I are ... just friends .
 So what are we ?
 I don 't know .
 What do you want to call it ?
 I guess , a ... committed relationship .
 Mm .
 Works for me .
 - Okay . - Hmm .
 It 's settled .


 Connie .
 This relationship is suffocating me .
 What 'd I say ?
 I 'm not enough for you . I didn 't say that .
 Just be honest .
 You want to date other girls .
 I don 't want to date other girls instead of you , just ... in addition to you .
 Drop dead .



 Okay , but I 'm gonna follow you and make sure you get home safe !
 Do whatever you want .
 If you walk to Dairy Queen , I 'll buy you a Blizzard .
 Want me to turn on some music ?


 Well , this is just delicious , Mary .
 Thank you .
 Bite- sized enough for you ?
 Oh .
 Perfect .
 How long do I have to sit here and sulk before someone asks me what 's wrong ?
 Maybe people are tired of hearing about it .
 Ms. Hutchins , would you care to chime in ?
 Oh , I- I don 't want to get in the middle of a family issue , but ...
 I will say that I once had a falling out with someone very close to me .
 What happened ? We ended up parting ways on bad terms .
 I- I still regret it .
 But you were right and they were wrong ?
 You know what , it doesn 't feel like it matters anymore .
 And not a day goes by that I don 't miss them .
 Perhaps I do owe Dr. Sturgis an apology .
 I was talking about your mother .
 I 'll circle back to her .
 Thank you .
 I can 't believe you got through to him .
 Happy to help .
 So , who was the person you had the fight with ?
 It was my cat , Poe .
 She ran away when I switched to dry food .
 It was cheaper .

 - Good night , baby .
 - Night , Mama .
 I 'm really sorry , Mom .
 I forgive you .
 But just because you straightened things out with Dr. Sturgis doesn 't mean you 're going back to college .
 - Yes , it does .
 - No , it doesn 't .
 I hope you know you 're jeopardizing our relationship .
 I will take that risk .
 Good night .

 You know I 'll eventually wear you down .
 We 'll see . I 'm pretty tough .

 I eventually wore her down .
 There 's just so much of me anybody can take .

 In local news , Friday night 's football game was marred by a brutal injury , when football coach George Cooper saved himself at the expense of beloved school librarian Cheryl Hutchins .
 Oh , no . We warn you , the following footage is hard to watch .
 Well , then , don 't show it .
 Let 's see it again in slow motion .
 This is not news .
