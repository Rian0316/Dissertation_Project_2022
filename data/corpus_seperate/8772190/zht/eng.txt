 00 : 00 : 00, 001 -- > 00 : 00 : 02, 568 What Salamanca is planning ?
 I don 't want to lie to my client .
 You 're talking about the fridge guy ?
 I mean all my clients .
 Your friend , um ...
 " Krazy- 8 " ?
 Has he ever been inside before ?
 He 'll keep his mouth shut .
 Mm- hmm .
 Mr. Varga , long time no see .
 Get in .

 Okay .
 ♪ Y mi para un hombre enamorado ♪ ♪ Da- da- da ♪ ♪ Paca paca paca paca en mi caballo ♪ ♪ Paca paca paca paca en mi caballo ♪



 Can I talk ?
 I- I- I 'll talk . I have a feeling I know what this is about .
 J- Just to get the ball rolling , please keep in mind that whatever happened between Mr. Varga and myself ,

 I 'm hoping that it 's just water under the bridge .
 ' Cause after all was said and done , you did walk out a free man .
 I mean , you weren 't even in custody for a full day .
 And I admit it was a tad bumpy getting there , but the path to justice is rarely smooth .
 So I 'm hoping that , in the end , you know , the final result speaks for itself .
 You had business with my cousin , Tuco .
 Tuco ?
 Ohh . Oh , sure , sure , yeah . A- And I see the family resemblance .
 Your cousin makes quite an impression .
 You know , he ... he has a huge heart and a ... a serious passion for justice .
 He 's got a temper , huh ?
 I hadn 't noticed . Uh .
 How is your lovely Abuelita ?

 You know , Tuco told me about you .
 You 're the guy with the mouth .

 Yeah .
 Those guys at the house ... what 'd they call her ?
 " Bizznatch " .
 " Bizznatch " .
 Yeah , right .
 You know , the Tuco I know ... he woulda skinned 'em alive and let the buzzards eat their eyeballs .
 But there you were . You go , " Blah , blah , blah " , and they walk out of there .
 I mean , it 's amazing , really !
 They wheeled out , actually .

 So , Ignacio and I , we got something you can do for us .
 Really ?
 Yeah . We got a legal problem . A le ...
 A legal problem ?
 Alright , fantastic .
 I 'm so ...
 Just , for a minute there ,
 I thought I was gonna be swallowing condoms filled with heroin .
 No .
 Maybe later . We have a guy sitting in MDC .
 Picked up two days ago .
 Uh , picked up for what ?
 Yeah , we 'll get to that .
 We need our friend to tell the cops some things .
 Some important things . Important things . Gotcha .
 We want him to say exactly what we tell him ... no more , no less .
 But the cops can 't know it 's coming from us .
 So we send you in there , you tell him how to do it , and they can 't listen .
 Attorney- client confidentiality .
 Yeah , that .
 Uh .
 It 's flattering . Uh .
 Can I offer this ?
 Listen , I guarantee there are five of these in MDC right now .
 You know , drop phones inside someone 's prison wallet , if you know what I 'm talking about .
 Anyway , you talk directly to your guy .
 Cut out the middle man .
 It works better if you 're in there with him .
 You 're the guy for this .
 That 's just ... That 's ... terrific .
 That 's the only word for it . Um .
 In good conscience , I think I have to s ... warn you that my ... my rates have gone up .
 Uh , so going this way could be expensive .
 Ex ...
 How expensive ?
 Expensive . It 's ... I mean ...
 - Yeah ?
 - Yeah .
 Um . Oh , gee , well , it 's a full day of my time . And prep work , transportation , rush fees ...
 Uh , do the math .
 It 's like seven thousand ... eight ... nine hundred ... and twenty five dollars .
 Yeah .
 Yeah . $7, 925 ? Uh- huh .

 Uh , it 's ... it 's the going rate , so ...
 Sure .

 For your trouble , let 's make it $8, 000 .
 Well .
 Okay , then .
 Another .

 I don 't know , Mike .
 How 'bout you call it a night ?
 And I 'll get you a cab .
 Put 'em in the register and pour me another .



 - Hey .
 - Yeah .
 You see that ?
 You want to do something for me ?
 Take it down .
 What ?
 Right there .
 The ...
 The third from the bottom .
 I dunno , Mike . Customers send these in .
 It 's a tradition .
 Take it down .
 Sorry , Mike .
 Take it down .
 I think you 've had enough .
 Take it .
 Down .
 Now .
 Please .


 Oh , my God .
 You know that 's my sister , y 'all .
 Let 's ...
 Hey , she is spicy , yo . That 's what I 'm saying .
 Yeah .
 I 'm trying to holla at her . - Oh . - Mm .
 Check this one out .
 Alright , y 'all . Let 's play .
 Hey , Gramps !
 Where ya going ?
 Yo , got 20 bucks you could lend me ? Ah .
 Don 't be scared .
 I ain 't gonna bite . Oh .
 I got a lot more than 20 bucks , asshole .
 - Hey , yo , Gramps can throw down .
 Okay .
 - Yo , we got a live one , bro .
 You gonna let ol ' cue ball there talk to you like that ? !
 Hold up , Gramps .

 So ?
 Good .


 Hey .
 Hey .



 You done ?
 Just about .
 Thanks .



 Everything good ?
 Yeah .
 I 'm sort of celebrating , actually .
 Celebrating what ?
 I just realized
 I have all pro bono clients tomorrow , all day .
 No Mesa Verde .
 Well , alright .
 To justice .
 Yeah .

 What about you ?
 Well ...
 I met ... some interesting people and had a few ... ups and downs .
 But you know what ?
 Financially speaking ,
 Saul Goodman just had his best day yet .
 Ka- ching !

 Huh .
 Good for Saul .
 I 'd better prep for tomorrow .
 Right .
 Go get 'em , tiger .
 iGol !

 Numilifor is not for everyone .
 Call your doctor if you have unusual aches and pains .
 - Sorry .
 - Side effects , including constip ...
 What are you doing ?
 I have to take it apart to clean it .



 Hey .
 Hey .
 Leave this alone .
 Leave it alone .
 Check this out .

 Did you order food ?
 Mnh- mnh .



 Yeah ?
 - Ignacio ?
 - What ?
 I want to see Ignacio .
 Who is this ?
 His father .


 Um .


 Hi .
 Amber , this is my father .

 Nice to meet you .
 Oh , yeah , me too .
 Um .
 'Scuse me .








 Mm .




 No .
















 Papa , no .
 No .









 Nice to meet you , young lady .




 Kim , something 's come up with Tucumcari .
 - Not now , Stef .
 - I wouldn 't bother you with it , but ...
 - I asked you to handle it .
 - We are , but there 's ... Stef , this is not the time .
 Alright ?


 Okay . Okay .
 Ms. Wexler , I 've reviewed your motion to dismiss and the state 's one- page response .
 Your argument is well- reasoned , however , I 'm denying the motion .
 Your Honor , I 'd like to remind you that this was essentially nothing more than a family dispute . - My client was ...
 - Yeah , I 'm gonna stop you right there .
 This is not your client 's first negative interaction with the victim , which shows a pattern of behavior .
 And as such , I still agree with the state that this matter is worth the court 's time .
 - Your Honor , my ... - Jury selection begins June 16th .
 I 'm sorry this didn 't go our way .
 Going in , we all knew getting the case dismissed would be a long shot .
 The judge seemed kinda mad . Yeah .
 She can come off that way , but she 's actually very fair .
 So now the prosecution will come back to us with a more realistic plea bargain , but if we don 't like what they have to offer ,
 I believe we 'll win at trial . What does that mean ?
 We 'll have a chance to explain what really happened in front of a jury of regular people .
 Look , you were trying to do a good thing , and I think they 'll see that .
 Just keep the faith , okay ? I 'm sorry . I 'll ...
 I 'll be right back . It 's Rich .
 This is the second time he 's called .
 Hey , Rich . I 'm confused .
 I thought you 'd be on your way to Tucumcari by now .
 - Uh , Rich ... - I just got off with Kevin Wachtell .
 He wants you there right now to straighten this out , hands on .
 Well , I 'm flattered , but my clients need me .
 I have a full day of appearances here .
 Well , all I can tell you ... he 's called twice in 40 minutes .
 I promise you , Tucumcari 's under control .
 The associates are more than capable . Help me understand .
 It 's not like you 're in the middle of a murder trial .
 Rich , this ... this is just Kevin being Kevin . Now , don 't get me wrong ...
 I respect your devotion to your pro bono clients .
 But Mesa Verde keeps the lights on .
 Can we agree on that ?
 Of course .
 We 've all been here .
 Once in a while , you have to give a little to get a little , you know ?
 Mm- hmm . Viola 's already briefed Stef and Gary .
 They 'll take your afternoon cases and get continuances if necessary .
 So get yourself down there , stat .
 Alright .
 I 'm on my way .

 Who the hell 're you ?
 Shhh !
 Now , thank you , Officer .
 We 'll let you know when we 're done .
 Sit .
 Who are you ?


 I 'm your new lawyer .
 - I didn 't call no lawyer .
 - No , you didn 't . Lalo did .
 I didn 't say anything to no one .
 - I kept my mouth shut . - I know , I know .
 Don 't worry , kid .
 I 'm nothin ' but good news for you .
 Alright , we have a lot to go over here .
 How are you at memorization ?






 Scuse me .
 Hey , Myrna .
 How 's the boy ?
 He 's good , Hank . He 's , what , uh , third base ?
 - Catcher . - Catcher . Hey , Steve .
 Looking good , Myrna .
 Lemme ask you something ... does Blanca throw stuff out on the exact day it expires ?
 - Like what ? - Anything .
 Uh , milk , ketchup , soy sauce .
 As the clock literally strikes midnight ,
 Marie hands me a full Hefty bag and pushes me out to the trash cans .
 I mean , you know , most of it 's still good .
 What the hell ?
 Food banks don 't take expired food .
 Oh , thanks for that , Ann Landers .
 Once I found an old can of , uh , vanilla frosting .
 I ate that .
 I 'm still here .
 You what ?
 Hey , we were talking about expired food .
 I thought it was relevant .
 Let 's get this circle jerk over with .


 Alrighty .
 Domingo Molina .
 Picked up for possession of half ounce of street grade gak .
 That 's dealing weight .
 Keeps his mouth shut for the first two nights he 's in here and now has an epiphany and wants to talk .
 Okay . Wow me .
 Make my tiny eyes grow wide with delight .
 What if I know where there 's half a million in drug money ?
 What if ?
 What .
 If ?
 If that 's true , things could go well for you . My partner 's right .
 That kind of information can lead to good things .
 Gimme the deets .
 Where the drugs come from , who the money goes to , the name of your boss and who you report to .
 For starters .
 Okay .

 The dealers kick up the cash , right ?
 But they don 't go face to face with the big guys .
 So ... they leave it in different spots .
 - Dead drops . - Yeah .
 Sounds like a big operation .
 Hello !
 Hey ! Oho ! Silence !
 Were you talking to them ?
 Were you talking to my client without his lawyer present ?
 And you are ... ? Saul Goodman . I 'm Mr. Molina 's attorney .
 And you 're in violation of his constitutional rights .
 Saul . Saul .
 Good . Man . Really ?
 Come on .
 That 's your name ? - Listen , Officer ...
 - Uh , uh . Special agent . Oh , the DEA ?
 Oh , I see . Okay . The Feds .
 Well , what , they don 't teach the Constitution at Quantico these days ? Yeah . Quantico is FBl .
 I don 't care .
 The DEA , FBl , Department of Sanitation . It 's time for you two gentlemen to vacate the premises .
 There 's the door . Shoo , shoo . Go away .
 Uh , your client waived his right to an attorney .
 Whoa , he most certainly did not .
 Yeah , I did . Zip it . Okay ?
 Nobody 's talking to you . Uh , well , he wants to talk to us .
 He ... He 's confused . Okay ?
 He was dropped on his head as a child .
 - I wanna talk .
 - No , you don 't !
 - Yeah . I do . - Sounds like he does .
 You just , uh , one ... one moment .
 Come ...
 Come here .
 Just come here .
 Do you know ... and we just discussed this , okay ?
 You don 't talk to ...
 I 'm doing my job !
 Which is protecting you from you ! I 'm talkin ' whether you like it or not ! You 're killing me here , man !

 Okay . Look .
 My client is making what I believe to be a grave error . Also showing a heartbreaking lack of faith in his attorney .
 And I 'm not gonna lie , it hurts .
 He insists on dealing , so let 's talk turkey .
 You know what ?
 We 're not interested .
 I feel like my chain is being jerked .
 And not in a good way , if you know what I 'm saying .
 There 's no half mil . Never was .
 - Yep .
 Bullshit .
 I called it , Gomey . Remember ?
 - You did .
 - Hold on , guys .
 Hold on .
 - Think I 'm gonna blow this Popsicle stand .
 - Wait a second .
 - You gentlemen have a great afternoon .
 - Hold up , guys , one second .
 - Hey , hey , have a good day . We 're done in here !
 Guys , um , uh .
 Uh , what if we say it 's contingent ?
 Contingent ?
 On what ?
 Results .
 Mr. Molina will stay in custody while you verify his very specific , limited information .
 And what if what he tells us doesn 't pan out ?
 Oh , well , then he just stays here . I mean , we 're back where we started .
 But if his information leads to something ...
 Arrests .
 Uh ...
 What ?
 If his information leads to arrests ...
 Well , yeah .
 Well , if his information leads to arrests , then ... the charges go away .
 Okay ?
 Now , how can you say no to that ?
 That is a win- win for you guys .


 Give us another minute .
 Okay .
 Okay , Domingo .
 Start talking . Go head .
 Like I said , the dealers kick up the cash .
 I don 't know who picks it up .
 All I know is that there are these three dead drops - they run on Thursday nights and ... - Hold on .
 What ?
 What ? ! Look , I know how this goes , alright ?
 My guy talks to you , you squeeze him out like a sponge , then you dump him back on the street .
 Word gets out that he 's a fink , he ends up bleeding out in front of his mother 's house .
 - What ?
 No .
 - It 's not gonna happen , okay ?
 Do you hear what I 'm saying ?
 My client is not leaving here with a target on his back .

 Fine .
 We 'll take care of him . Assuming this isn 't one big jag off .
 It 'll look like he got out because his lawyer 's a genius .
 Okay . And he 's ... he 's not just anyone 's C. I. , either .
 Alright ?
 You don 't pass him around like a venereal disease .
 He 's your personal C. I.
 So , he gets picked up , he calls me , I call you .
 It gets taken care of .
 No questions asked .
 Okay , but it 's contingent .
 Sure . And this better be worth it .
 Yeah .
 Okay . So , like I said , there are these three dead drops .
 The first one 's under a bridge up by Chavez Road , over Hillsdale Street .
 The second one 's in an empty rail yard off Waldren in a train shed .
 There 's a ...


 Oh , thank God .
 - Is he home ?
 - Yeah , he never seems to leave .
 A word of warning .
 He 's very unpleasant .
 Got it .

 Mr. Acker , I think you 're home !
 My name is Kim Wexler , and I 'd really like to talk to you !



 Mr. Acker .
 Hello .
 Thanks for speaking with me .
 I think there 's been a misunderstanding , and it 's in everyone 's best interests if we straighten it out .
 May I come in ?
 Stay right where you 're at .

 Okay .

 As I understand it , you and your family have been here since 1974 .
 You built this lovely house , but you never actually owned the land it was on .
 It was leased to you by a local company , Deerview Investment Properties . For a hundred years .
 I got 70 left . That 's correct .
 However , and I know this may be difficult to wrap your head around , your lease stipulates that the property owner can buy you out at any time for fair market value plus $5, 000 .

 I know $5, 000 isn 't nearly as much as it used to be back in 1974 , and ... and we do understand how ... inconvenient this must be , so , as a gesture of goodwill ,

 Mesa Verde has just increased your buy- out to $18, 000 . $18, 000 ?
 That 's right .
 Well , nobody 's ever explained it to me like that before . $18, 000 .
 That 's a lot of money .
 I bet you , with that , I could buy a big old mansion and a swimming pool .
 Mr. Acker , we know it 's not enough to ...
 Hey , do me a favor , will ya ?
 I 'm gonna spread my legs out like this , and , uh , just to finish it off , why don 't you give me a swift kick in the balls ?
 That 's not necessary . You people are all the same .
 You 're soulless money grubbers . Please , Mr. Acker , how about we just discuss this ... civil ?
 Adverse possession means this is my land .
 You made that argument in court , and the judge ruled against you .
 Yeah , and nobody could change my mind , so they sent you out .
 You 're the big guns ? With a ponytail ?
 Oh , you 're just like all the rest of 'em , coming out here in your fancy suit , bring your minions with you , driving them black , shiny German cars .
 And you think you can talk to me
 like I 'm brain damaged ?
 N. O ! No !
 That big bank thinks it 's gonna build a call center , so ... you go around throwing people out of their homes .
 Well , not this house , sweetheart !
 Alright . I can see you 've made up your mind .
 Have a good day .
 And I can see you .
 You 're one of those people that , uh , give a little money to charity every month so you can make up for all the bad that you 've done .
 You go to a soup kitchen once a year on Thanksgiving . That makes you feel a whole lot better about yourself .
 Makes you feel like one of the best rich people .
 Oh , I don 't know how in the world you sleep at night .


 Listen to me .
 You do not get to make up your own rules .
 Put on your big boy pants and face reality ... no one is mistreating you here .
 We were trying to meet you halfway ... well , that 's over .
 The $18, 000 ? Guess what ?
 It 's off the table . Tomorrow you come to your senses ? You 'll get $10, 000 .
 And you know what happens after that ?
 The sheriff comes out and kicks you outta here and you get nothing .
 Why should you get to drag this out for seven months while all of your neighbors , every single one of them , played by the rules ? !
 And do you ... do you ... do you think you 're special ?
 A contract means something . It 's the law , and it 's enforceable !
 Deal with it !
 That was amazing .
 Great job .
 I didn 't solve anything .
 Mm .
 You ended it .
 That 's what we needed .


 Whoo- hoo !
 You hear that ?
 I replaced the carburetor .
 She 's running like a racehorse , man .
 It 's a fine vehicle .
 That 's a thing of beauty . Yeah ? What do you drive ?
 An Esteem . A what ?
 A Suzuki Esteem .
 It 's an import . Huh .
 So ... ? Yeah , so , it went just like you wanted .
 Assuming the dead drops are a real thing , the feds are going to be on them . - Feds ? - Yeah .
 DEA .
 There 's a matched pair of 'em , and they 're into this with a vengeance .
 I mean , think feeding time in the lion cage .
 And , um they 're gunning for arrests .
 Okay .
 Oh , and ... your guy is now a confidential informant .
 What do you mean ... like a rat ? No , he 's not a rat .
 No . I mean , well , if he 's a rat , he 's your rat , so ...
 Uh , put it this way ... you now have a hotline to the DEA .
 And not just now ... anytime .
 So that 's a good thing , right ?
 But the deal is , at some point , you might hear that Domingo is a snitch .
 Y- You gotta know he 's not . And what do you care ?
 Well , all due respect , you 're paying me , but he 's my client .
 I 'd like to keep him alive .

 And , uh , one more thing .
 Um , you 're gonna have to find a different attorney for future endeavors ,
 ' cause my schedule is just very , very tight .
 You 'll make time .
 Ah .




 Who exactly did I just set up ?
 You don 't want to know .
 I mean , if there 's gonna be blowback ,
 I don 't want to be in the middle of it .
 It 's not about what you want .
 When you 're in , you 're in .





 And Martinez ?
 We got a continuance .
 Good . Davenport ?
 The judge read your motion and dismissed .
 Yes .
 Oh , and I got a continuance on Russo .
 His hearing 's scheduled for Thursday morning , right ? Yep . Viola put it in your calendar .
 Good , What about Ingram ?
 He didn 't show . Did you call all three numbers ? I called the first one .
 You have to call all three . The bottom number is his aunt .
 - She usually knows where he is . - I 'm sorry .
 I got a continuance .
 That 's okay .
 Call his aunt and make sure he 's alright and ask how I can get in touch with him before his next hearing .
 And if she doesn 't know , call the Rescue Mission Shelter on 2nd .
 That 's his backup .
 Will do .
 Alright .
 Uh .
 Good job , Stef .
 Thanks , Kim .
 Get home safe .
 Yep .
 Have a good evening .



 Mr. Acker ?
 It 's Kim Wexler again .
 I 'd really like another word with you .

 Mr. Acker ?



 Mr. Acker ?
 I 'm sorry I- I , uh , entered your property .
 I 'd really like to talk to you .



 Hi .
 Can we start over ?
 Say what you came to say .
 I went to a real estate office .
 I found some houses I think you might like .
 There are some really nice options in your price range .
 This one 's on half an acre .
 And , uh , this one ... is older , but it has a really good view .
 And the neighborhood 's pretty .
 I know moving 's a big deal . I 'd like to help you out with that myself , if that 's alright with you .
 I can take off any day this week .
 And I 'll pay for it out of my own pocket . Uh .
 Oh .
 This one has three bedrooms .
 I know you don 't want to move , but w- whatever house you choose will be yours .
 You 'll own it , and the land , forever .



 You 're right . I can 't pretend to understand what you 're going through .
 I 've never owned a house .
 My family never owned one , either .
 We never owned ... anything . When I was little , my mother used to shake me awake in the middle of the night , yelling it was time to go .
 She was always one step ahead of the landlord .
 I 'd throw my things in a cardboard box and run outside in my pajamas and bare feet .
 Sometimes , it was so cold , my t ... my toes turned blue .
 If we 'd have had a house ,
 I never would 've wanted to leave .
 You 'll say anything to get what you want , won 't you ?




 When was this ?
 Today .
 Do you have the agents ' names ?
 The lawyer 's got 'em .

 What are you doing ?
 Shutting it down . Put it away .
 You want to leave the money for the feds ?
 Um .
 If there 's no money in those dead drops ,
 Lalo will know someone talked .
 The dead drops remain .
