 Well , our new outdoor seating area is about as popular as Paula Deen at an NBA game .

 How much longer do we have to be out here ?
 We are cold .
 So , so cold .
 I can see my breath .
 And my boys are up by my rib cage .
 I can smell his breath .
 And my boys are up by where my boys used to be .
 And these customers aren 't helping .
 How could we have thought a strong Han presence would make it more popular ?
 Max , in hindsight , it feels like us not springing for those heat lamps was a bad call .
 Uh , you think ?
 Guys , I just peed a little to keep warm .
 Well , I peed a little
 ' cause I had no choice .
 Great , they 're stuck to the bench .
 Go get the windshield scraper .

 Ooh , " Stars .
 They 're just like us . "
 Well , if they 're just like us , where 's the picture of them turning their underwear inside out ?
 Caroline left it in the men 's room .
 And as I said that out loud ,
 I realized that I must have been in the ladies ' room .
 I can 't see , Max .
 Max , I 've got some exciting news !
 Eh , I vowed I 'd never get excited about anything again after that last Indiana Jones .
 I found us two discount heat lamps on Sherry 's list .
 It 's like Craigslist , but without the high probability of being murdered by a deranged medical student .
 And about those lamps ?
 Uh , no .
 We can 't worry about our outdoor business .
 We barely have an indoor business .
 And we never will , with that attitude .
 I 'm gonna ask you one more time : please listen to those Tony Robbins tapes we found in the garbage .
 Well , girls , tomorrow 's the day I 've been looking forward to for three years .
 You 're getting your teeth cleaned ?
 Sorry , that 's what 's we 've been looking forward to .
 I 'm moving in with Sophie .
 From now on , the booty call is coming from inside the house .
 I couldn 't help but overhear .
 From way back there ?
 Your ears should give a pep talk to the other parts of your body .
 And , Oleg , if you need any help with the move , might I offer my services ?
 My trainer Skylar says I 'm getting ripped .
 Yeah , ripped off by Skylar .
 Thanks , Han .
 And as a bit of a payback ,
 I 'll wash my hands back here tonight .
 See you later , neighbors .
 Oleg 's moving in ?
 This is the worst thing that 's ever happened to me .
 And I lost $2 billion .
 What is the problem ?
 This is all good news .
 Sophie an Oleg are in love .
 Yeah !
 And they 'll be in love on our stairs , in our hallway , and on every surface of the laundry room .

 What do you know about love anyway , Christian Single ?
 I know Jesus has a girl for me .
 He has to .
 I 'm $400 deep into that damn website .
 Look , we just make a pact that no matter what happens upstairs , or on the stairs or in the laundry room , we don 't invite it into our apartment .

 Hey , everybody !
 Oh !
 Brr ! It 's raining cats and goats out there .
 Don 't you mean " cats and dogs " ?
 Oh , it 's so nice to be corrected as you walk in the door .
 Hey , baby .
 Can you believe in 24 hours we 'll be living in sin ?
 Oh , don 't worry .
 My parents don 't know .
 I 'm having a dinner party tomorrow night to celebrate .
 And also because I have 15 pounds of beef that 's about to go bad .
 So , Max , Caroline , are you in ?
 Actually , Sophie , we 're busy ...
 We 'll be there .
 If there 's beef involved , I 'm involved .
 What happened to the pact we just made ?
 I hate to tell you this ... if it comes down to you or beef ,
 I 'm always going beef .
 That was Sherry from Sherry 's list .
 She makes you call her that .
 She said she 's consider charging us $150 if we pick up the heat lamps themselves .
 And I 'm charging you with three counts of interrupting this " Baby in a Faulty High Chair " video .
 Someone fell in real life !
 You told me you had it .
 I said I didn 't have it .
 It 's Oleg and Han moving in .
 Get away from the door !
 Han will see your feet under the door .
 They 're right at his eye level .
 This is like a horror movie ...
 Saw ill .
 Because when Han bent over ,
 I saw 3 inches of his crack .
 So you saw his whole crack ?
 Step away !
 Open the door , Max .
 I 'm about to kill Han , and I know you 're gonna want to see that .
 Damn it !
 He 's right .
 Cute outfit , Han .
 Like one of those male strippers from " No Thunder From Down Under . "
 This is so heavy .
 Oleg , what do you have in here ?
 Socks !
 Really , Han ,
 It 's like your arms are only there for decoration .
 To be fair , Oleg 's socks probably have some pretty heavy loads in them .
 Oleg , what is all your junk doing out here ?
 Do I actually smell girls screaming ?
 I bring things up , Sophie says " No , "
 I bring them right back down .
 Is there no elevator up in this bitch ?
 Oleg , you forgot your painting , and this one 's a definite " No . "
 Sophie , I haven 't gotten a " Yes " yet , aside from the quickie we had up against the bathroom sink .
 Not such a quickie .
 They locked me out and I had to eat my lunch in the truck .
 Then what was the point of me renting a moving truck ?
 I mean , besides the rough sex we had up against the sides ?
 They locked me outside on the side of the road for that one .
 Okay , well , we have to go back in .
 See you tonight at the beef- a- thon .
 No , Oleg .
 Maybe I 'm being unfair .
 I mean , you have all this stuff that you like , and they have an apartment .
 Put it in there .
 Sophie !
 I 'll see you at 8 : 00 !
 So what do you say , girls ?
 Absolutely not ...
 Yes .
 Max , there 's a method to my madness .
 Oleg , will you excuse us a second ?
 And maybe help Han with that box .
 In those shorts , I can actually see a hernia happening .
 I thought we weren 't getting involved !
 If we help Oleg out , he 'll let us use the moving truck to pick up our heat lamps .
 I already said " No " to those .
 But we just talked about it !
 I wasn 't listening !
 That baby fell face- down into mashed potatoes .
 But you said " Yes " to the dinner party , so if you get your meat , I get my heat .
 Just because you rhyme doesn 't make it okay .
 And I 'm pretty sure that 's what Rihanna said to Chris Brown .
 Where are we meeting this chick with the heat lamps ?
 I haven 't gone this far for something I didn 't want since Planned Parenthood moved to New Jersey .
 Hello !
 I 'm getting truck sick back here .
 You 're a worse driver than people assume I am .
 Come on !
 Come on !
 We 're gonna be late to dinner !
 Would any of you be interested in playing rock- paper- scissors for a seat up front ?
 No !
 Girls , can I ask you a relationship question ?
 No !
 And besides , what would we know about relationships ?
 That 's like asking Donald Trump for the name of a good hairstylist .
 I mean , what 's the deal with her ?
 She asks me to move in , and then won 't even let me have my painting ?
 I mean , Sophie already bought the cow .
 She might as well let the cow 's crap in .
 So you 're saying I 'm right .
 No , no , but I do think ...
 No , you don 't think , or your mouth wouldn 't be moving right now .
 I 'm just saying , he has the right to move some of his stuff into Sophie 's apartment and out of ours .
 Speaking of his stuff , there 's something in a box back here is humming , and ... oh , it stopped .
 Oh , it started again .
 That 's my lifelike mouth with authentic jaw action .
 Oleg , watch the road !
 The last words I hear can 't be " lifelike mouth . "
 Everything looks very nice , Sophie .
 Yeah , see ,
 I 'm not gonna talk until the other guests arrive .
 I got to save my hostess sparkle for the real guests .
 Hey , baby .
 Where the hell have you been ?
 That was a pretty loud sparkle .
 It 's my fault we 're late , Sophie ...
 It 's okay .
 Just sit down .
 Don 't you want to know what I was ...
 No , really .
 I got a pot roast over here that 's a hell of a lot more interesting .
 Max , thank God you 're here .
 There was so much awkward silence ,
 I pretended I got a phone call from a banana .
 I 'm gonna take a quick shower .
 Oh , Oleg , Dinner is ready .
 You don 't have time to run down to the " Y " now .
 No , I meant I would shower here .
 Here ...
 In my bathroom ?
 Uh ...
 Yeah .
 I live here now .
 Oh , yeah .
 That 's right .
 Imagine that .
 Hey , Oleg , why don 't you just come over here and sit next to Earl ?
 Because he 's old and I 'm sure his smeller is shot .
 Sophie , you really must write a " how to entertain " book .
 Here we go :
 Grandma Chinkski 's pot roast .
 This looks amazing .
 I love a root vegetable in the winter .
 Can it ever just be about me ?
 ♪ Beef , beef , beef ♪ ♪ B- beef , b- beef , beef ♪
 What ?
 That 's my beef song .
 I 'd like to make a toast to Sophie .
 Oh , that 's sweet .
 But not with that glass .
 That 's Grandma Chinski 's crystal .
 Baby , I was in the middle of a toast .
 Oh , I 'm sorry , but ... those are my favorite thing !
 Grandma Chinski traded two of my slow cousins for those .
 Well , you know , it 's funny .
 I have a favorite thing too .
 In fact , why don 't I just go and get it ?
 I can 't believe it .
 I 'm about to meet Lon Anderson !

 Can someone help me lift up my fork ?
 My arms are still sore from the move .
 Open up .
 Someone else has to feed Han .
 He just licked my pinky .
 Earl , what are you doing over there ?
 Just hanging out with R& B sensation ,
 Mary J. - juana .
 Oh , good .
 So you 're in the right mind- set to hand- feed a 30- year- old man .
 Oh , no , no , no , no , no .
 I think that 's Polish for " No . "
 Uh- huh .
 Yes , Sophie .
 It 's my painting .
 Excuse me ... our painting .
 And it 's going up on our wall .
 Is it me , or is this party tense as hell ?
 I don 't think Sophie and Oleg are gonna make it .
 Uh- oh .
 Am I talking out loud right now ?
 I told you , I don 't want that thing in here .
 I don 't understand .
 It 's just a painting .
 What 's so bad about it ?
 Oh , my God .
 Nice , huh ?
 I did it myself .
 It 's a paint- by- numbers .
 You mean it 's a Putin- by- numbers .
 Why are his nipples so big ?
 They don 't seem that big to me .
 Oh , I am too high for this .
 I 'm not high enough .
 In my culture , big nipples mean power and wealth .
 In our culture , big nipples means ,
 " Wears a t- shirt in the pool . "
 There .
 I like it .
 Adds a certain something to the room .
 Every wall needs nipples .
 So a guy knows where to look .
 Thank you for telling me to do this , Caroline .
 She did ?
 I 'd get up and run , but my legs are like taffy .
 Seriously , you told him to hang that thing up ?
 In fairness , I had not seen the painting when I suggested something like that .
 I mean , I get it .
 It 's gorgeous .
 But it doesn 't go with the décor .
 What ?
 Is it throwing off this gorgeous outdoor- indoor swing ?
 I 'll cut you with the carving knife !
 Nobody is cutting anyone .
 Especially not me .
 Do you never learn ?
 Just put some beef in your napkin like I did , and let 's get out of here .
 Sophie , you asked me to move in . Guess what ?
 I moved in .
 Yes , I asked you to move in , but not with big weird- nipple Putin .
 Well , how big are nipples supposed to be ?
 ' Cause ... never mind .
 And what 's your problem anyway ?
 I gave you a drawer .
 This !
 This is my drawer .
 What good is this ?
 I can 't even get one of my ball gags in there .
 You asked for a drawer , I gave you a drawer !
 And who needs 12 ball gags anyway ?
 Oh , so now you don 't like ball gags ?
 Who are you , lady ?
 I 'll tell you who I am ...
 I 'm the lady who 's " Putin " this is the trash !
 You trash that , I 'll trash this .
 Oh , no .
 Oh , you think you 're gonna break one of Grandma Chinski 's glasses ?
 No , if anyone 's gonna break one , it 's gonna be me !
 This reminds me of the first half of my second marriage , and the second half of my third marriage .
 Sophie , I 'm done .
 And as you said to me on our first date ,
 " I don 't know how much more of this I can take . "
 Fun party .
 Not awkward at all .
 I should get going though .
 Got to be up early for ... what 's a thing ?
 Church ?
 ♪ Beef , beef , beef ♪ ♪ B- beef , beef , beef , beef ♪

 Sorry about that dinner party last night .
 It kind of got away from me a little bit .
 But I really appreciate you getting up early and helping me move Oleg 's stuff back .
 I just actually feel like this is a little bit my fault ...
 Seriously !
 Can it ever just be about me ?
 Hey , um , where are we taking his stuff anyway ?
 I don 't think Goodwill will take a love seat that 's actually covered in love .
 Well , I was thinking , you know , since Oleg and I really did have something special ,
 I was thinking I would just take his stuff and dump it down by the river .
 Okay , I 'm just gonna say it ...
 Sophie , would it kill you to just let Oleg hang the damn painting ?
 So what , you just park the truck in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway ?
 Do you never learn ?
 I almost ate Rent- A- Truck floor mat .
 Caroline , you get this straight ...
 Oleg was wrong .
 And those nipples were way too big .
 This is awkward .
 You 're in the truck ?
 No , you 're in my apartment .
 I think something hit us .
 You guys just need some couples therapy .
 I 'll mediate it , since I 've had therapy myself .
 Not as a couple , but hopefully someday .
 I 'm just sitting here waiting for the tow truck to come .
 How 's your neck , Max ?
 Not so bad .
 The second car that hit us kind of knocked what the first car knocked out of place back in place .
 I 'll start .
 This woman is a fraud and a liar .
 Okay , well , we need a little more Oprah , a little less Jerry Springer .
 Hey , don 't dis Springer .
 They have great snacks in the green room .
 You were on Jerry Springer ?
 Yeah , I was on " I hate my roommate and I don 't know how to tell her . "
 Oleg and I are not gonna talk this thing out .
 If you want to waste your time , go teach in an inner city high school .
 You know what ?
 Even better ...
 I 'll do the talking for Oleg .
 Oh , then , Max ... you be me , okay , Max ?
 Oh ...
 I don 't know if ...
 Do you want the rest of the beef , or not ?
 This guy is a bum , and the painting has to go .
 It 's stupid .
 Really , really good , Max , but next time just arch your back a little , and , yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay , you be me .
 No , I don 't feel like getting a threatening erection right now .
 But I will say , anytime people move in together , it 's a compromise .
 Look at Max ... when I needed a place to stay , she let me have my horse .
 Let me just say ... and I brought this up on Springer ...
 I only let you in because of the horse .
 And I finally stopped putting up a fight and let Max walk around naked .
 When did that happen ?
 Tomorrow .
 Oh , Oleg ,
 I wouldn 't want you to give up walking around naked .
 I mean , as long as you don 't sit down on anything white .
 Makes sense .
 Nobody likes a chocolate starfish on an ottoman .
 Point , Sophie .
 Ha !
 I 'm winning , everybody !
 Well , it 's therapy .
 There are no winners and losers .
 Sounds like something a loser would say .
 You know , Oleg , this isn 't about that silly little painting .
 It 's just , uh , a lot of change in a short amount of time ...
 I 'm so scared .
 Sophie ,
 I don 't care about my stuff , as long as I have you .
 What did we just do ?
 We had them apart , and now we just put them back together .
 You did that .
 You don 't know when to butt out .
 Jerry 's words .
