 00 : 00 : 01, 568 -- > 00 : 00 : 02, 634 Earl , can I borrow your paper ?
 I want to check my horoscope to see if I 'll still be a whore in the future .
 All right , who wants to go first ?
 Ooh , do me . Do me .
 Do me .
 Can we have one night at the dinner that doesn 't end with you yelling that at a woman ?
 All right , I 'll go .
 " Gemini , The Twins , " and they 're both doing fine , so let 's move on .
 Han , what sign are you ?
 I 'm guessing the 40- year- old Virgo .
 Max , you don 't need that paper .
 I 'll tell you what 's in your future ...
 Using my name as a reference at Chipotle .
 You guys really believe in that crap ?
 They just tell you what you want to hear .
 " You will be rich .
 You will be famous . "
 You 'd think I 'd buy a newspaper if it said ,
 " you will be a 75- year- old cashier " ?

 Okay , ready to open ?
 Never have been , never will be . Let 's do this .
 Wait . We have to do our business affirmation .
 Please , God , don 't let us be murdered in here .
 All right , let 's open 'em up .

 - Oh , hell no . - Max . Hang on .
 I wasn 't done . Oh , hell no !
 Oh , she 's yarn- bombing that bike .

 It 's whimsical .
 It 's new . It 's stupid .
 Graffiti , I get .
 I see , " die , bitch . Die , " on a wall ,
 I think , " okay , this gentleman wanted to get that off his chest . " but this yarn- ival is pathetic .
 Yo , yarnie .
 I have a name .
 It 's Guinevere .
 Yep , that checks out .
 What 's happening over here ?
 Why are you molesting that poor bike ?
 Well ...
 I am beautifying the city one living , glorious work of art at a time .
 And tips are always appreciated .
 [ Scoffs ]
 Here 's a tip :
 Go back to school and learn a trade before daddy 's money runs out .
 Well , I never ...
 Worked a day in your life , we know . You think this is artwork ?
 Artwork is a Garfield mug , sweetheart .
 You got Garfield in a hammock , saying , " I 'm not overweight . I 'm under- tall , "
 I 'll build you a gallery right here .

 Look , you should move on .
 My friend doesn 't want you ... How shall I put this ?
 Taking a giant knit in front of our shop .
 What is the problem ?
 It is not even your bike .
 It 's been chained here for , like , four months .
 Oh , yeah ?
 Maybe it is our bike , and we use it for deliveries and to trap nerds .
 Peace out , ganja beer , before I knit you a noose .
 Max , that was a great idea .
 What , that she go back to school ? I know .
 At least a couple night classes , right ?
 Get around some people .
 She 's a lost cause .
 Let 's move on .
 I 'm talking about us doing deliveries . Why do we never deliver ?
 Speak for yourself .
 I 've delivered .
 Seriously , Max , those delivery services ...
 Eat24 , Grubhub ... do big business .
 No one wants to go out now .
 People are so lazy .
 I don 't really feel like it .
 Seriously , Max , all we have to do is slap a delivery charge on that product , and suddenly , a $5 cupcake is bringing in more money .
 And do you know what more money means ?
 No .
 How would I know that ?
 Okay , question :
 Which of these goes better with no pants ?
 I don 't know . They 're both timeless ...
 As in , there 's no time you should wear those .
 You can 't be objective .
 You 're like a kid in a candy store . I 'll ask Max .
 Uh , well , the red one kind of matches your rash .
 I think we have a winner .
 So why are you trying out the fancy mesh tonight ?
 Well , even though Sophie and I are getting back together , we wanted to make it special and hold off on the sexual part of the relationship until tonight .


 - That is so sweet . - I know .
 I haven 't even masturbated since right before I came in here .
 So , Chestnut , I was buying some rolling papers at the Bodega , and I hope this is cool , but I said they were for you .
 Max , I have good news and bad news .
 The bad news is , this is the only good news I 've had in three years .
 And the good news is ...
 You found yourself a new apartment ?
 Don 't toy with me , woman .
 Speak plainly and clearly .
 Did you find a new apartment ?
 Close your eyes . I 'll give you a hint . Last time I was told to close my eyes ,
 I woke up in a bikini on a garbage barge .
 P. S. , closest I ever got to a vacation .
 [ Horn honking ]
 Oh , you 're dating a clown ?
 Please , you know I would have told you if I was dating someone who had a car .
 Look , it 's the abandoned bike from in front of the shop .
 It was the bike from the front of the shop .
 Now it looks like a contestant on
 We 're gonna use it to make deliveries .
 I already signed us up for three delivery services .
 Still crazy smart . Waste of time .
 Amazon 's got drones , and we 've got one gay bike .
 I don 't want to do deliveries .
 I got this . You bake , I 'll bike .
 And while you bike , I 'll get baked .
 I 'm just gonna knock out these three " delivs " and I 'll met you at the cupcake shop .
 - " Delivs " ? - You like " delivs " ?
 It 's an " abbreve " I made up for " deliveries . " You like " abbreve " ?
 It 's an " AB " I made up for " abbreviation . "
 I 'm gonna make this short .
 Get out . Hey , everybody .
 Sophie , what do you think ?
 Aw , good for you , Caroline .
 I 've been saying that you should hop on something pink and ride it since I met you .
 [ Horn honking ] Ah , Max , I 'm so glad you 're alone ,
 ' cause I need some girl talk .
 Okay , but the last time I did girl talk ,
 I got $3 for the first minute and $1 for each additional minute .
 No , it 's about Oleg .
 Last night , he was unable to ...
 Oh , what 's a nice way to say this ?
 He couldn 't get his soldier to stand at attention , and his penis wouldn 't work either .
 Well , uh , have you tried buying a magazine or something ?
 They usually have advice on sex stuff and how to hate your body .
 Max ...
 You don 't think it could be me , do you ?
 No way , Sophie .
 You are hot .
 Ah .
 The first time Oleg saw you , his soldier not only saluted .
 It exploded .
 You 're right .
 I am hot . It 's all him .
 Remember when I said you didn 't have to do deliveries ?
 You 're gonna have to do deliveries , ' cause I only went two blocks , and I 'm sweating like Shia Lebeouf at a dui checkpoint .


 Okay , you deliver . I 'll open the window .
 But first , business affirmation .
 Please , God , don 't let us get pistol- whipped in here .
 It 's either that Guinevere or spider- man came out .

 Caroline , can I talk to you about a private matter , by which I mean the matter is my privates .
 Okay , but hurry , Oleg .
 I 'm in the middle of a dream catcher situation , and it 's a nightmare .
 And why me ?
 ' Cause I trust and respect you and I feel like you know your way around a limp penis .
 Maybe .
 I talked to my therapist ...
 Roy , you know , down at the Starbucks .
 He told me it 's all mental .
 We didn 't get much further than that .
 He spilled a grande mochaccino on his sandals .
 You 're probably just scared .
 Intimacy is so hard for some guys , it 's not hard for some guys .
 Yeah , that 's all over my head .
 Oh , no , Max forgot the order slips . Oleg , I 'm sure it 'll all work out .
 Good luck getting your penne al dente .
 Again , over my head .


 Max , what are you doing ?
 What are you doing ?
 What am I doing ?
 Well , I think I 'm watching you shove our delivery bike into the back of an uber car .
 Well , this is uber- awkward .
 Come on , come on . In or out .
 All right , Caroline , this is Milesh , with a " K. " he doesn 't go to the airport , and he once drove some of Maroon 5 ...

 So Maroon 3 .
 No , stop . Caroline .
 If you want me to deliver the cupcakes , I can 't use the bike , I have to use the car . Why ?
 Oh , my God , are you pregnant ?
 You ask me that every day , and almost every day I say no .
 Look , I want to tell you , but it 's a secret .
 And you can 't tell anybody .
 Do you seriously think I would ever tell anyone anything about this life ?
 Right .
 I don 't know how to ride a bike , okay ?
 You don 't know how to ride a bike ?
 Max doesn 't know how to ride a bike ?
 Damn it , Caroline !
 [ Laughing ] Max doesn 't know how to ride a bike .
 Oh , happy day . I finally have something over her .
 There is a God , and he 's laughing at her too .

 Lordy , this is harder to watch than Jim Carrey in a drama .
 [ Laughing ]

 [ Knock at door ]
 Max , are you up ?
 What 's that smell ? Did you bring home Greek food ? No , that 's me .
 That 's how you smell after you ride a bike all over Williamsburg delivering 14 orders of cupcakes , and I do not wish to smell like this again , so you have to learn how to ride that bike , all right ?


 Who do you think you are busting in here smelling like hummus but having no hummus ?
 What is the problem ?
 Didn 't your mother ever teach you how to ride a bike ?
 No , my mother was too busy being the town bike .
 Well , then I 'll teach you .
 Nope . Never getting on a bike . It 's one of my three " nevers . "
 Yes , well , your first " never " was ,
 " never having a blonde roommate . "
 You are chipping away at me piece by piece , lady .
 I 'm not going anywhere until you tell me what 's going on .
 I 'd sit on your bed , but that 's your third " never . "
 [ sighs ]
 When I was little , there was this kid , Tommy Doonan .
 Nice kid , solid hopscotcher .
 Used to give me his fruit roll- up at lunch every day .
 Max , did he give you these fruit roll- ups , or did you take them ?
 Don 't interrupt .
 One day , Tommy Doonan got a new bike .
 He was out front with this nice , older man who looked just like him .
 You mean his dad ?
 Mm , is that what they call them ?
 I assumed it was a predator .
 So anyway , I was making fun of him
 ' cause he seemed happy .
 I thought that was our thing .
 And he started showing off , doing wheelies and stuff , to put me in my place , but then he flipped up over the handlebars and came down hard on his face .

 Sad , but not worth me having baklava pits .
 Well , wait .
 After I stopped laughing and the man picked him up and hugged him predator- style ,
 I saw Tommy 's teeth had busted through his cheek .
 To put it plainly , his mouth was on the outside of his face .
 Ew , that 's like something out of a horror movie ,
 like or or ... well , that 's probably enough .
 Every time I see a bike , I think of his little face and his little teeth chomping out the side of it .
 He had to eat apples like this ...
 [ Babbling ]
 Max , you are not responsible for that .
 Yeah , I know , and 1 out of the 12 jurors agreed .
 Thank you , number six .
 Anyway , it freaked me out , so good night .
 No , Max .
 It is not going to work that way .
 You 're learning how to ride a bike .
 I 'm already on one painful cycle .
 I don 't want to get on another one .
 Max , I have access to tootsie rolls , and if you get on a bike , I will give you four .
 What am I , a chimp ?
 - Five .
 - Let 's go .


 Don 't look so smug , chestnut .
 You don 't know how to ride a bike either .
 Come on , Max , just out here in the alley .
 Oh , hell no ! - What ? - She 's been back here too .
 - Who ?
 - Guine- queer .
 There 's so much yarn- bombing , it 's like craft- ganistan .
 Max , let it go .
 Stay focused .
 Get on the bike .
 No .
 I don 't want to eat apples out of the side of my face .
 Come on .
 Let me teach you . - Nope . - Want a tootsie ?
 You know I do .
 I mean , you taught me how to be poor .
 Eh , you 're getting really good at it .
 Come on .
 You know what they say about riding a bike .
 It 's like riding a bike .
 See ? It 's fun , see ? Whee !
 Whee , whee , whee , whee , whee !
 Whee ! You got a real pretty mouth , Caroline .

 Can 't wait to see it on the side of your face .
 At least just get on the bike .
 You don 't even have to go anywhere yet .
 - Nope . - Want a tootsie ? You know I do .
 Go .
 [ Groans and scoffs ] What is this bar doing here ?
 I have no use for a bar that can 't get me drunk .
 Okay , walk the bike over there and lean against the car to get your balance .
 Just check and make sure there 's no one around .
 Why do you care ?
 The only people out here this late would be rapists , murderers , and freaks ...
 [ Chuckles ] You know , your peeps .
 ( Max ) What the ...
 Hey , girls . Sophie ?
 What are you doing in that car alone ?
 Oh , a dark alley at 3 : 00 A. M. ?
 Has money gotten that tight ?
 Yes , but that 's not why we 're out here .
 I 'm teaching Max how to ride a bike , and it 's pretty hard . Oh , yeah , I wish I had that problem .
 I 'm dancing with a rope in here .
 We 're trying some exotic , new locales for our lovemaking .
 It 's exotic because this isn 't even our car .
 ( Sophie ) Oh , uh ...
 We better hurry before that rabbi comes back . Maybe try barking at it again .
 There was some movement earlier .
 [ Sophie barking ]
 Come on , Caroline , teach me how to ride this thing .
 I got to get away from Temple Gross Shalom as fast as possible .
 Okay , I 'm gonna get behind you and hold on to your seat .
 Not without three long island iced teas and one , " your butt looks good in those jeans . "
 - Tootsie ?
 - Yeah .
 Max , don 't look .
 Yarn- bombing ? ( Han ) Hey , Max .
 ( Max ) Han ?
 I 'm just riding my bike to the bike store to buy more bikes .
 Is that Han or
 Lance Armstrong 's runaway testicle ?
 Sorry , couldn 't hear you . I was too busy knowing how to ride a bike .
 Damn it !
 Now I got to do this .
 You know how quickly society will crumble around us if Han starts feeling like he can freely tease me ?

 - You sure ?
 - Yep .
 Making fun of Han is one of my two free sources of entertainment .
 The other one is located right above this bar .
 Okay , I 'll keep my Hand on the seat , and then when you 're ready , tell me , and I 'll let you go .
 Okay , but don 't let go until I say so .
 Okay , let go .
 Already did .
 I 'm riding a bike ? Max , look out ! Pothole !
 [ Groaning ]
 There goes my other free source of entertainment .
 Tootsie ?
 Yes , obviously !


 [ Bell rings ] Table ten . Pick up , Max .

 Yeah , be right there .
 Like , you know , in a month .
 Uh , Max , how you doing ? I heard about your vag- accident .
 Look , if you need to see a doctor , my cousin in Florida is a good one , but then again , the bumpy bus ride might kill you .
 No , no , it 'll be fine , Earl . I 'm icing it .
 I just have to keep it cold .


 We 're out of Ginger ale .
 I think you mean the Ginger ale is out of you .
 Max , let me get that for you .
 I feel like it was kind of my fault .
 Kind of ? Was Lincoln 's death kind of John wilkes booth 's fault ?
 [ Bell rings ]
 Pick up , Caroline . How 'd it go with Sophie ?
 Were you able to do the thing , you know , the man does while the woman makes shopping lists in her head ?
 Shh . Come on .
 I don 't want anyone to know I can 't get it up .
 Oleg can 't get it up ?
 [ Laughing ] OMG .
 Oleg can 't get it up .
 [ Laughing ]
 Best week ever .
 Hey , everybody !
 What 's up ?
 Not your boyfriend .
 [ Laughing ]
 If anyone needs me , I 'll be outside riding my bike with an erection .

 Oh , no , no , no , no .
 He didn 't hear it from me . I only told two people ...
 Max and my manicurist , Ming Wa .
 And you don 't have to worry about her because she doesn 't care about anything except loving some guy named long time .

 Sophie , baby , this is hard .
 Yeah , maybe we better not try to be serious .
 I mean , the real truth is ,
 I only like you for your penis anyway .
 Say that again .
 What , that I only like you for your penis ?
 One more time .
 Well , what , that I don 't have any real feelings for you ?
 That it 's completely sexual and I only like you for your big , stupid penis ?
 I 'm back , baby .
 Sophie , can I see you in the kitchen ? And we better hurry .
 I 'm making three- minute eggs .
 Cancel my eggs .


 I would 've so left during that whole conversation , but I 'm holding a can of Dr. Pepper between my legs .
 What ? He 's a doctor . He 's seen it .
 Well , I think we 're pretty much even .
 Your legs are a little sore , and I 'll never have children .
 So I guess what I 'm saying is thanks .
 So you really don 't want to get back on the bike ?
 You 're just gonna give up ?
 I bet even Tommy Doonan got back on the bike .
 Whatever happened to him ?
 I caught up with him on Facebook .
 Well , more like really- messed- up- face- book . He 's happily married .
 I bet right now he 's driving his car ,
 looking straight ahead , and smiling at his wife in the seat next to him .
 So that 's it for deliveries ?
 Oh , you can deliver wherever and whenever you want , but there is no way I am ever getting on that bike again .
 Max , look .
 Guinevere . Oh , hell no !
 She yarn- bombed our darn barn ! You two should 've tipped .
 I 'm an artist .
 Eat my stitches , bitches .
 [ Gasps ]
 That was not whimsical at all .
 Give me the damn bike .
 Knit 's about to hit the fan . [ Can thuds ]
 Max , you 're doing it .
 What happened to your fear of bikes ? I guess the only thing stronger is my hatred of that nerd !
