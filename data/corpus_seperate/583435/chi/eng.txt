 Great . Great . Just give me a sec to change film .
 Okay . I know I 'm not supposed to know , but I do and I am so excited for you .
 - Why ? What 's going on ? - Monica 's pregnant .
 Oh , my God ! Is that why you guys had to get married ?
 - Guys , I 'm not pregnant ! - Ah , slow swimmers ?
 What ?
 What do you mean ? You 're not pregnant ? - You didn 't tell anybody I was , did you ?
 - No . I 'll be right back .
 Now why don 't we get a shot of Monica and the bloody soldier ?
 Oh , about that . Joey , you have to change before the party . I can 't .
 I don 't have any other clothes .
 Find some . Please ! Anything that doesn 't say , " I died tragically in France . "
 Then why don 't we see the bride and the groom , and the bridesmaids ?
 Hey , Mon ? Why did you tell the guys that you weren 't pregnant ? Because I 'm not .
 We found your test in the trash . If you 're not pregnant ...
 ... it 's because I am .
 What are you talking about ? Yes . Ahem .
 I am with child .
 And I didn 't wanna say anything because it 's your day . - I didn 't wanna steal your thunder .
 - So you told people I was pregnant ?
 Does this look like a conversation I wanna remember ?
 - Who 's the father ? - Yeah . I can 't say .
 - Why ? - Why not ? I can 't say because he 's famous .
 Oh , my God , who is it ?
 Come on , you have to tell us . Okay , okay .
 It 's James Brolin .
 James Brolin is the father of my baby . As in , Barbra Streisand 's husband , James Brolin ?
 What ? He never said that to me .


 Monica , if you can step away , we 'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids .
 How about just the bridesmaids ? I am the groom . I was told it was kind of a big deal .
 - It is .
 - Yeah .
 - Oh , my God ! - Thank you for doing that . I just can 't deal with this just quite yet .
 - So instead you told me Monica was pregnant ? - You did , I just didn 't disagree .
 - Sneaky ! - Yeah .
 - Smile , ladies ! - Ohh .
 - By the way , James Brolin ? - Ugh . I know .
 I could only think of two names : Him and Ed Begley Jr . And then ...
 I remembered he 's gay , so ...
 - Ed Begley Jr . Is not gay . - Really ?
 Thank you very much . Ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure ... ... to introduce to you for the first time :
 Mr. And Mrs. Chandler Bing !
 - Before we go out there , I got a present for you . - I 'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket .
 - No . - No ? - I 've been taking dancing lessons .
 - What ?
 Yeah , for the last 6 weeks . I wanted this to be a moment you 'd never forget .
 Aww . That is so sweet !
 So would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife ? - Yes .
 - Okay .
 - What 's the matter ? - These new shoes are all slippery .
 - Are you going to be able to do this ? - Not well .
 Well , the good news is I don 't think anyone 's looking at us .
 - So you ready to talk about it ? - No .
 Now ?
 No .
 Okay , we 'll talk about something else . - Thank you . - Who 's the father ?
 Uh .
 Look , honey , I haven 't told him yet ... ... so until I do , I don 't think I should tell anybody else . Yeah .
 That 's fine . That 's fair . Is it Tag ?
 Ugh .
 Phoebe !
 - Okay . I 'm sorry , I 'll stop . - Okay .
 Is it Ross ?
 It 's Ross , isn 't it ?
 - Oh , my God , it 's Joey ! - Honey , stop it , okay ?
 I 'm not going to tell you until I tell him . Ah- ha !
 At least we know it 's a him .
 Oh , sweet lord . I 'm sorry , okay ?
 I went down to the gift shop , and it was either this or a bathrobe .
 Look , what 's more important ? The way I 'm dressed or me being with you today ?
 Honey , I 'm not even going to pretend I was listening . Hey ! Hey .
 Hi .
 I 'm Ross . I don 't believe we 've met . I 'm Monica 's older brother .
 - Hi , I 'm Mona from her restaurant . - Oh .
 Hello , " Mona from her restaurant . "
 Mona . What a beautiful name . You think so ?
 I always kind of hated it .
 - Aw , come on ! Mona Lisa ? - Uh- huh .
 Mona ... ... Klegglachen ?
 The famous botanist . Huh ?
 Oh , no . She 's ... Well , she 's dead now .
 But supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world .
 - Really ?
 - Yeah .
 - Well , see , I never knew about her . - Linda Klegglachen ...
 So , what table are you at ? Oh , heh , me too .
 Good . There will be someone who likes my name .
 Yes , there will .
 Guess what , Molly Gilbert . You 've just been bumped up to table one .
 And if it 's all right with you , I 'm gonna take your place at table six .
 Martin Klegglachen !
 That 's better . Just bend your arms a little more . There you go .
 Look straight ahead . Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it .
 Chandler , darling . Look , my date has finally arrived . I 'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips .
 - Congratulations . - Thanks .
 Dennis is a dear old friend . And a fantastic lover .
 Bravo , Dennis , thanks for pleasing my mother so .
 I 'm so sorry I missed the ceremony . I was stuck at auditions .
 Dennis is directing a new Broadway show .
 Hi , I don 't believe we 've met . Joey Tribbiani .
 - Dennis Phillips .
 - Wow . I 've admired your work for years . You 've done some amazing stuff .
 Thank you . Excuse me , I 'll get myself a drink .
 I 'll be back in a moment .
 Dennis Phillips ! That 's great ! How did you guys meet ?
 Well , you know , it 's a funny story .
 Funny " ha- ha , " or funny " boom , uh- oh ! "
 Thank you very much . Now if everyone will please take their seats , dinner will be served .
 Hey .
 - Uh , I thought you were at table six . See , before , when you showed it to me , you held it that way ... ... which was misleading . - Uh , no .
 Nine .
 Ohh .


 Well ...
 I 'll ... um ...
 Hello .
 Chandler ! Will you see if your mom can give my résumé to Dennis Phillips ?
 Because if I can get into a Broadway show , I would 've done it all :
 Film , television and theater . The only thing left would be radio , and that 's just for ugly people .
 - What size shoes do you wear ? - Uh , eleven . Eleven and a half .
 Great .
 My shoes are giving me a problem on the dance floor . - Can I borrow the boots from your costume ?
 - I don 't know where I left those , so ...
 - Those aren 't eleven and a half . - Okay , fine , I 'm a 7 !
 All right , I have surprisingly small feet . But the rest of me is good ! I 'll show you !
 - Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant ? - Let 's not talk about that now .
 - This is so huge . - Sure , but as big as your wedding ?
 Of course not . Nothing is . - Wow .
 Between me and you ? - Yeah . In this day and age , how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant ?
 Hey , sometimes you can do everything right , wear what you 're supposed to ... ... and one of those little guys just gets through .
 - How ? - I don 't know , maybe they have tools .
 Well , I talked to her , and she 's definitely gonna have this baby .
 She 's gonna raise it on her own .
 Well , maybe that 's really brave .
 I just hope she realizes how hard it 's gonna be .
 Maybe she hasn 't really thought it through that much .
 There 's a lot to think about .
 How is she gonna handle this financially ? How is she gonna juggle work ?
 Does she realize she 's not gonna have a date again for the next 18 years ?
 I don 't know . Are you okay ?
 Mm- hm .
 I 'm just thinking about Phoebe . Poor , knocked- up Phoebe .
 - Champagne ? - Oh , yes . Thank you very much .
 Whew .
 That 's actually how the French drink it .
 Well , I just got off the phone with my lover , James Brolin . - Really ?
 - Yes . And apparently , he is married to some singer .
 But he said he 'd leave her for me . So I said , " Are you sure ? "
 - And James Brolin said ... - Rachel 's the one who 's pregnant ?
 What ?
 Why bother ? How do you feel ?
 I don 't know how I feel . This is all happening so fast .
 I have to make all these decisions that I don 't want to make . Mm ! Oh !
 Someone take this away from me ! - Calm down . Maybe you 're not pregnant .
 - What ?
 When I got pregnant with the triplets , I took the test three times . Yes .
 Maybe it 's a false- positive . Are you sure you peed on the stick right ?
 How many ways are there to do that ?
 I 'm just saying , don 't freak out until you 're 100 percent sure .
 I 'll take it again at home .
 You gotta take it now , as a present to me . Okay .
 Thank you .
 - I 'll run out and get you one . - Aw , you girls are so great .
 Wait a minute . Who 's the father ?
 - She won 't tell us . - Come on ! It 's my wedding .
 That could be my present .
 - Hey !
 I just gave you peeing on a stick . - See , this is why you register .
 It was the chair again , okay ? I 'm not doing it ! It was ...
 Look , I don 't . You know what ?
 - Hi .
 - Hi .
 - Would you like to dance ? - Sure . - Yeah .
 - Oh , great .
 - Dr. Geller ? - I wasn 't farting !
 Uh , a little game from our table . - Yes ?
 - Dr. Geller , will you dance with me ? Oh . Um ...
 Maybe later . I 'm about to dance with this lady . Okay .
 Ooooh .
 Unless this lady wouldn 't mind letting you go first .
 I 'd be happy to . You are very sweet . Ohh .
 Yes , I am .
 In fact , why don 't we try it my special way . You can dance on my feet . - Sure .
 - Yeah ?
 Hop on .
 - Is the pretty lady looking ? - Uh- huh . Keep dancing .
 And the world will never know . - Hey !
 Did you talk to Dennis ? - Yes . I told him how talented you were .
 - I told him all about Days ofour Lives . - No , you don 't tell a Broadway guy that !
 - Now he thinks I 'm just a soap actor . - But you 're not just a soap actor .
 You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet . Hey .
 - Thank you . - No , thank you , Miranda .
 - Melinda . - All right .
 - How cute was that ? - Oh ! Were you watching ?
 - Can I go next ? - Uh ...
 Of course you can . Hop on . Okay .
 But I get to hop on after her .
 - I am so gonna score ! - What ?
 I like your bow .
 I 'd like to propose a toast to Monica and Chandler ... ... the greatest couple in the world , and my best friends .
 When I first found out they were getting married , I was a little angry . I was like , " Why , God ?
 How can you take them away from me ? ! "
 But then I thought back over our memories together .
 Some happy memories .
 Then there were some sad memories .
 I 'm sorry .
 And some scared memories . Whoa !
 Huh ?
 And then I realized I 'll always be their friend .
 Their friend who can speak in many dialects ... ... has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity .
 Oh ...
 To the happy couple .
 - That was nice . - Can we do it again ?
 No , no .
 - So is it my turn ? - I 'm next . Oh !
 - That 's okay , you can dance with her first . - Are you sure ?
 Okay .
 - So what 's your name ? - Gert .
 That 's pretty .
 Come on .
 Whoa !
 Whoa !
 What are you doing , Gert ?
 Dancing on your feet like the other girls did it .
 Okay . Hop on , Gert .
 - Why aren 't you moving your feet ? - I 'm trying .
 Faster ! You 're not going fast enough !
 Maybe I should stand on your feet !
 So did you happen to catch my toast up there ?
 Oh , my God . That was for my benefit ? Well , I like to think there was something for everyone .
 - I know you 're casting for this new show . - Look , Joey , I don 't think you 're right for it .
 See , that 's where you 're wrong . Whatever it is , I can do it .
 - And if you didn 't see it up there , just try me . - It 's an all- Chinese cast .
 Can you be Chinese ? - I 'm not proud of this , but ...
 - Oh , my God . No , please ! Don 't !
 - Ready to get back on the dance floor ? - Did it turn into sand ?
 - Come on , I love this song . You 'll be fine . - No , I won 't .
 Do you know why I took all those lessons ?
 For the first time , I didn 't want you to be embarrassed ... ... to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot . Aww .
 Sweetie , you could never embarrass me . Okay , you could easily embarrass me .
 But it doesn 't matter . Right ?
 I married you . So I 'm gonna dance on my wedding night with my husband . Come on !
 - Just try not to move your feet at all . - Oh .
 There you go .
 - Chandler , I 'm gonna have you arrested . - Why ? You stole my moves .
 - How much longer ? - Thirty seconds . Thirty seconds .
 Okay .
 Did I miss it ?
 Rachel , I want you to know ... ... that if it 's positive , we ...
 - I know . I know . - You do ?
 Okay .
 It 's time .
 No !
 - Go ahead , Rach . - Oh , wait . You know what ?
 I can 't look at it .
 I can 't look at it . Somebody else tell me . - Okay .
 - Okay .
 It 's negative .
 - What ? - It 's negative .
 Oh .
 Well , there you go . Whew !
 That is ... That is really great , great news .
 Because the whole ... ... not being ready , the financial aspects , all that ...
 This is so just the way it was supposed to be .
 Well then , great .
 God . This is so stupid .
 How can I be upset over something I never had ?
 It 's negative ? No , it 's positive .
 - What ? - It 's not negative , it 's positive .
 - Are you sure ? - Yeah , I lied before . Oh !
 Oh , my God !
 - Now you know how you really feel about it . - Oh ! That 's a risky little game .
 Are you really gonna do this ? Yeah .
 I 'm gonna have a baby .
 I 'm gonna have a baby !
 - With who ? - No , it 's still not the time .
 I just didn 't see the fast song coming . Shh . Don 't try to talk .
 We 'll get you up to your room , soak your feet . You 'll be okay . - Oh , thank you .
 - That is so sweet ! - Yeah . - No , I mean it .
 There 's so few genuinely nice guys out there . Tell me about it .
 I feel like I 'm holding down the fort all by myself . - It 's Joey , right ?
 - Yeah .
 Wait a minute ! No ! I 'm the nice one !
 I 'm the one that danced with the kids all night .
 How small are your feet ?
