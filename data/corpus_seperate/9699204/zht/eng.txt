 - Hello , Kermit .
 Nice legs .
 - [ boys laugh ]
 Have you got green pubes , Kermit ?
 What is that ?
 - [ boy 2 ] Oh , she is such a freak . - [ boy 3 ]
 She 's a creep .
 You should be careful dressing like that .
 And you should be careful perpetuating old- fashioned patriarchal ideology .
 It 'll make it difficult for people to like you .
 [ boys ]
 Hey !
 Come on , Kermit , show us your pubes !
 You 're a bitch !
 Yeah , I am .
 Mmm .
 Come on then .

 That 's it .

 - Good morning . - Ah !
 Why are you in my bed ?
 If you tell anyone about this , I 'll destroy your life .
 Did we have sex ?
 Of course we had sex , Otis .
 I 'm not here because I enjoy your company .
 But I can 't find the condom .
 We had sex without a condom ?
 - No , I 'm pretty sure we used one . - Well , where is it ?
 I don 't know , it 's vanished .
 Mmm ...
 You don 't think your vagina swallowed it , do you ?
 - I heard about the girl ... - I can 't believe I had sex with you .
 Okay , Ruby , we definitely used a condom , right ?
 Yes . I 'm , like , 99 percent certain .
 Oh !
 [ retches ]
 - Sorry . - [ Jean ] Otis !
 Come down .
 [ bottles clinking ]
 [ approaching footsteps on stairs ]
 Hello .
 - I 'm Ruby . - Hello , Ruby .
 I covet your pant suits .
 Oh .
 - Thank you . This one 's ... - I was just being polite .
 I 've gotta get to school .
 [ whispering ] You said a small gathering !
 - [ door opens , closes ]
 - It was only supposed to be ten people , but Eric invited a whole load more and suddenly 150 strangers were in the house .
 - [ loudly ] A hundred and fifty strangers ? - It was not my intention .
 Otis !
 I 'm not hearing a lot of responsibility being taken here .
 I have clients coming this afternoon and my house is trashed !
 Oh , it 's too loud , and I 'm late , and my head hurts , and I- I- I ...
 I will help you clean later .
 - Later ? - Yes .
 Later ? Otis !
 - Uh ...
 - [ door opens ]
 [ door closes ]
 See you , cheeky chops . Love you .
 - [ Joe ] Are you spying again ? - I don 't trust her .
 - Who , Body Slammer ? - No , her mum .
 What 's she doing there ?
 Joe , have a look , would you ?
 I can 't see .
 I don 't know , she 's watching TV .
 I knew she was up to something .
 Oh , yeah . Quick , call the police , our neighbor 's watching
 [ gulps ]
 Oh !
 Oh !
 Ah !
 Hey !
 How are you feeling , Casanova ?
 Why is the world so bright ?
 Because you got very drunk , offended your unrequited love and ex- girlfriend , puked on yourself , and danced really badly in front of most of the people at this school .
 [ laughs ]
 - Eric .
 - Mm- hmm .
 - I had sex with Ruby . - What ?
 - [ groans ] - Are you sure you had sex ?
 Well , she definitely thinks we had sex . The details are hazy .
 I feel really strange .
 I feel like I 'm either having an unusually long panic attack or I 'm just very , very thirsty ... or both .
 - [ groans ] - Okay , calm down and listen to me .
 Probably wasn 't the romantic forest glade fantasy - you imagined with Maeve .
 - I did not imagine that .
 But you are not a virgin anymore ! What ?
 - That 's exciting , right ? - It 's not .
 - Sex has consequences . - Well , it 's not like you 're gonna father
 Ruby 's evil spawn .
 [ laughs ]
 You did use a condom , right ?
 Right ?
 Otis , I have noticed that you 've not answered my question .
 Oh , my God .
 Hi , Maeve .
 [ clears throat ]
 I 'm really sorry about last night .
 - I said ... - I heard you shagged Ruby , dude .
 Who knew Sex Kid was such a player !
 [ boys laugh ]
 Congratulations .
 That was withering .
 [ girl ] Oh , no , no , no !
 I 'm embarrassed !
 - [ boy ] Mate , have you seen this ?
 - [ girl 2 ] What 's happening ?
 [ laughing ]
 I was drunk .
 - Yes , yes , you were , mate . - Seriously !
 I can 't believe you told Dr. Milburn I had crabs .
 - I said you might have one crab . - Holy shit .
 Miss Sands loves doing dirty talk with Mr. Hendricks .
 - Amazing . - [ girl 3 ] That is amazing .
 What did Jean do ?
 Your mum said I was normal .
 She lied .
 " Connor Pearson admits to masturbating up to 17 times a day ,
 - which is borderline obsessive . " - I 'm a monster !
 This is bad , very bad .
 How could Jean leave her notes lying around ?
 Well , I have to go anyway .
 I 've got Swing Band practice .
 Seventeen times ?
 Dirty , dirty pig .
 [ crying ]
 What on earth ?
 [ girl ] I thought it was confidential !
 I promise you we will get to the bottom of this .
 Jackson , wait !
 - I had to tell them . - We 're not friends , Viv .
 You said some pretty horrible things to me too , you know ?
 Fine . We were never friends in the first place .
 Aimes , you 're covered in mud .
 Yeah . I am .
 - Can we talk ?
 - Not right now , Steve . I 'm late for gym .
 Aimes , guess what ?
 - Otis had sex with Ruby last right .
 - I 'm sure it didn 't mean anything .
 Are you okay ?
 Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm sure he didn 't mean it . He was really drunk .
 Yeah .
 Yeah .

 Hello , Jean speaking .
 [ Mr. Groff ]
 There 's been an incident .
 - Just be here at 4 : 00 p . m .
 I 'll be there .
 Shit ! Guys , come and take a look at this .
 [ girl ]
 Oh , my God !
 No dillydallying , girls .
 It wasn 't me .
 - It was not me . - I wouldn 't have the time .
 Someone is in very serious trouble .
 [ dog barks ]
 Ah .
 You 're on time . That 's odd .
 I have an errand to run , so will you be all right with Jessie ?
 - Uh , yeah , I like dogs . - Are you sure ?

 She 's very annoying . You know , she can 't even sit .

 Oh , yes . I feel your pain .

 [ sighs ]
 Otis ! Otis !
 Uh ... [ sighs ]
 - What ?
 - Shh .
 Okay , so ... you know how I said I was 99 percent sure about the condom ?
 - Yes . - It 's more like 96 . 5 .
 The details are a bit hazy and I think I remember putting it in the bin , but I can 't be sure .
 Okay . What should we do ?
 [ bell ringing ]
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 - Shall we go play - Oh , I can 't .
 I 've got to go to a service at my church tonight .
 - Is church boring ? - No .
 It 's actually quite fun , you know .
 There 's singing , there 's plantain , and if you 're lucky , sometimes this auntie called Gloria
 - starts speaking in tongues . - Cool .
 - Can I come with you ? - You don 't want to come to my service .
 I think it will be interesting , unless you don 't want me to .
 No ! Okay , sure .
 But , um ... [ laughs ] ... I have to be a bit different there .
 Like , a bit more serious , if you get what I mean .
 Yeah . That 's okay .
 - You sure ? - Yeah .
 Let 's go to church .
 [ laughs ]
 [ Jackson ] What are you doing here ?
 We 've made an appointment with your counselor .
 - Can 't we do this another time ? - No , we 're doing it now .
 Get in .
 Get in the car .
 Well , well .
 Here we are . I don 't like keeping you after school , girls , but this is serious .

 I had nothing to do with this , and it 'll look really bad on my school CV ,
 - so may I go home , please ? - No , you may not .
 Somebody in this room thought it would be funny to write something very cruel about me on that mirror .
 We 're going to sit here until they admit it was them .
 No one has anything to say ?
 Fine .
 You will circle every " A " in the paper until one of you owns up .
 - That 's not very productive , miss . - Neither is slut- shaming your teacher .
 Get circling , girls . I 'll be back to check on you .
 Have you ever done this before ?
 No ! What are you trying to say ? You slept with me too , you know .
 I know , I 'm not trying to say anything .
 Look , I 'm not having your pale , unusually long children , okay ?
 - So just go in and get it already . - Me ?
 I can 't be seen buying the morning after pill , Otis .
 People will talk .
 Go on . Go on .
 [ Roz ] It 's important to tell Dr. Aiken everything .
 You might need to up your meds . You are taking them ?
 [ Sofia ] Your mum just asked you a question .
 Yes . I 'm taking them .
 Well , why didn 't you answer her then ?
 [ loud pop ]
 - [ Roz ] Shit . Oh , God .
 I think it 's a flat .
 - [ Sofia ]
 Brilliant , we 're gonna be late .
 - [ Roz ] I can 't control it , can I ? - [ Sofia ]
 You drive too fast .
 [ Roz ] I don 't need this right now .
 So , who 's changed a tire before ?
 It wouldn 't be good for my hand .
 Brilliant .

 Very sensitive sinuses .
 [ register beeping ]
 [ muffled ] And can I get the morning after pill , please ?
 - Excuse me ? - [ slurred ] The morning after pill ?
 - I can 't hear you . - [ slurred ] The morning after pill .
 - I still can 't hear you . - [ loudly ] The morning after pill .
 I can 't sell it to you .
 - Why not ? - You don 't have a vagina , sir .
 [ door chimes ]
 It 's not ... It 's nasal spray .
 - You need to buy it in person .
 - [ door chimes ]
 What ? Why ?
 Ugh !
 This is so humiliating .
 It 's not humiliating .
 Okay ? I mean , stuff like this happens all the time .
 Condoms break , or people forget to use them , or they just go missing .
 It 's nothing to be ashamed of .
 I also want you to know if you are pregnant and chose to keep the baby , I 'll quit school , get a job and provide for you both .
 [ door chimes ]
 - When did you last have sex ? - Last night .
 - Obviously .
 - Did you use contraception ?
 Yes .
 - I think so .
 - [ Otis ]
 The prophylactic 's missing .
 Sorry , I 'm not here .
 - When was your last period ? - Two weeks ago .
 Have you taken the emergency contraceptive pill before ?
 No . Why do people keep asking me that ? I 'm not a slut .
 Does anyone in your immediate family have any health problems ?
 My dad has MS. He was diagnosed last year . It 's quite bad .
 So , can I have the pill or not ?
 That 'll be £25 .
 It 's his penis , he 's paying for it .
 I am .
 I am ?
 - Please don 't tell anyone I was here . - I 've no idea who you are .
 That 's impossible . Everyone knows who I am .
 [ register beeping ]
 Mm .
 - Right , you 've gotta be kidding me . - Look , I 'm just saying , if you push it in first ...
 - [ Sofia ] Mind your hand out of the way . - Oh , just push it in first , and then ...
 [ Sofia ] Oh , my God . This is stupid .
 I 'm calling them .
 - I said we don 't have to . - This is so typical of you .
 Why can 't you just admit you can 't do it ?
 I can do it .
 Well , if you can do it then why isn 't it done ?
 [ laughs ]
 And why are you laughing ?
 Because you both just need to get a divorce .
 Why would you say that ?
 Because it 's true .
 You fight all the time .
 You 're so angry at mum , but you pretend that you 're not .
 And you 're so scared
 I won 't love you like a biological mum that you just spend most of your time pushing us both away .
 I just think we 'd all be a lot happier if you just get a divorce .
 Yeah , I 'll go get her .
 Mum !

 [ Aimee ]
 I 'm finished too .
 I think you 're supposed to circle all the " A " s ,
 - not just the singular ones . - You 're so dumb sometimes , Aimee .
 - Olivia , do you want this pen in your eye ? - [ Viv ] You guys are such clichés .
 Except for you , Lily . You 're genuinely weird .
 - Thanks . - What category are you in , Pythagoras ,
 - other than freak ? - The really , really intelligent one .
 Oh , really ? [ blows raspberry ]
 Olivia , Mr. Groff wants to see you .
 - [ Viv and Maeve ]
 Ooh !
 - Shut up .
 Anyone have anything to admit ?
 - You can circle the " I " s next .
 - Please , Miss Sands . This is pointless .
 Okay , you want a challenge ?
 You can spend the rest of detention preparing a presentation on what binds you together as women .
 One or all of you wanted to tear a fellow female down , now you can spend some time thinking about what you have in common instead .
 - You are joking , right ? - No , I 'm not .
 You have two hours to enlighten me .
 Unless you want a month of detentions instead ?
 I 'd like you to know we take these issues very seriously indeed .
 [ Mr. Groff ]
 Olivia , come in .
 Were you aware that Malek had received sex advice from Miss Milburn ?
 Malek Amir talked about his girlfriend wanting to incorporate ...
 - fetish ...
 - Those are my private notes , and they 're not meant to be read by anybody else .
 And I 'm sorry , but I don 't know how they were misplaced .
 Olivia , do you know how old your boyfriend is ?
 He 's ... He 's 16 .
 Fifteen .
 - Fifteen ? - Yeah , I skipped a year in primary school .
 - What do you mean " fetish " ? - Amir is not an Indian surname .
 We are Iranian .
 - Iranian . - You 're 15 ?
 You could go to prison for statutory rape ! This is very serious .
 - [ man ] Iranian ? - Fifteen ?
 What the fuck , Malek ?
 Okay , Mum ... [ muffled arguing ]
 - [ man speaking indistinctly ] - We are not going to press charges .
 But how could you give sex advice to children ? It 's despicable .
 I didn 't give sex advice .
 I answered a question about a possible fetish .
 And I gave the correct information concerning that subject .
 - I ... I didn 't tell them to do anything ... - You shouldn 't have been talking to 15- year- olds about fetish at all .
 This is not what you were employed to do .
 And I made that very clear .
 - Yes , but my report ...
 - Is no longer welcome on campus and nor are you .
 [ mouthing ]
 [ indistinct arguing ]
 - Back to detention , Olivia .
 - For God sake !
 Can we talk about how exactly my private notes got distributed around your campus ?
 I have no idea .
 I could just tell them it was Sex Kid who gave us the actual advice .
 I 'm sorry , what ?
 You know , Otis . His advice was super strange , but it worked .
 But he charges a lot for it though , which sucks .
 Well , that 's why I came to you because you 're free .
 This is so stupid .
 Well , we have to come up with something if we want to go home .
 - Does anybody like fantasy gaming ? - I do .
 - I love
 - Oh , I 'm more into dressing up as Ripley from
 I don 't get cosplay .
 - What about shopping ? - I hate shopping .
 - Me too .
 - Can 't we just pretend we 're all into shopping or cosplay ?
 That would be cheating .
 We could try a mind map .
 [ approaching footsteps ]
 - [ Viv ] What did Groff want ?
 - I might be going to prison because apparently , my boyfriend 's 15 .
 - Anybody else also into younger men ?
 - [ Olivia ]
 What are we doing ?
 - Figuring out what we have in common . - ... things we all like .
 - Are you all right ? - Yeah , are you ?
 - Yeah , I 'm great . - Great .
 It 's going well then .
 Ugh .
 [ moaning ]
 [ horn honks ]
 How long have you got ?
 I gave them an impossible assignment about female solidarity ,
 - they won 't finish for ages . - You 're so evil .
 Say it again .
 You 're so evil .
 Mmm .
 [ moaning ]
 - [ panting ]
 - [ bagpipes wheeze ]
 [ vocalizing ]
 The church is very beautiful , Mrs. Effiong . It 's not what I thought .
 - Do you attend the mosque ? - Anthea . You can 't ask that .
 Sorry , Rahim . Just ignore my sister .
 - I thought you were Muslim . - Anthea .
 Eric , I don 't think your sister means to be rude .
 - I just wanted to know . - Just ... You don 't have to answer that .
 No , it 's okay . My family 's atheist .
 What 's an atheist ?
 It 's someone who believes that there is no God .
 Okay ? Shall we be quiet now ?
 We can 't touch each other in church .
 Don 't come over here .
 I don 't want to talk to you right now ,
 - hence why I walked away . - It 's ridiculous , Mum .
 [ sighs ] I just ... I need a moment alone , Jackson .
 I 'm not going anywhere until we talk , so ...
 That was the most hurtful thing you could possibly say to me .
 Yeah , I know .
 - That 's why I said it .
 - [ scoffs ]
 - I didn 't mean it , I was just angry . - No , you did mean it .
 - I didn 't mean to make you cry , Mum .
 [ sighs ]
 I 've just always been so afraid that you would say I wasn 't your real mum , and now you 've actually said it , I 'm almost relieved .
 - Of course you 're my real mum . - But you didn 't come through me .
 - So ?
 - That 's why I was so happy when you said you wanted to swim because that 's my passion , something we could do together .
 I thought it was because you couldn 't compete anymore ... and you were living your dream through me .
 Well , maybe there 's a bit of truth in that .
 - I did enjoy it ... a lot .
 - I genuinely thought you enjoyed it .
 Do you know what I enjoyed most about swimming when I was a kid ?
 Spending time with you .
 You were my hero , Mum .
 When we were together , I felt like I could do anything .
 [ chuckles ]
 Why did you have to grow up ?
 - I don 't want to swim anymore . - I know .
 It just doesn 't make me happy .
 But it 's got nothing to do with our relationship , okay ?
 You 've gotta let me figure out who I am and what else I like to do on my own .
 But you 'll always , always ... be my real mum .
 [ Sofia sniffs ]
 [ sighs ]
 I got a part in the school play .
 - What ? - Yeah .
 Playing Romeo .
 [ laughs ]
 - Well , you were very believable as Joseph .
 - [ both laugh ]
 - [ Jessie barks ] - Jessie . No .
 [ barks ]
 - Sit .
 - [ barks ]
 [ barking continues ]
 [ Jessie barks ]
 [ barking continues ]
 [ whimpers ]
 Wait .
 Wait .
 [ Jessie whimpers ]
 - Sit .
 - [ whimpers ]
 Here you are .
 [ door opens ]
 [ clears throat ]
 How are you you , New Kid ?
 Since when do you ask questions ?
 I 'm trying to work on my small talk .
 How is he ?
 [ scanner beeps ]
 Eric ?
 He 's confused .
 I don 't know what 's going on between the two of you , but if you hurt him , I 'll ...
 I 'll mess you up .
 I don 't want to hurt him anymore .
 Then don 't .
 I said fucking diet .
 [ piano music playing ]
 [ man ]
 Hallelujah !
 Jesus is with you .
 Jesus is with you .

 Jesus is with you .
 Thank you , Pastor . [ chuckles ]
 - Welcome . - Thank you .
 Jesus is with you .
 Oh , sorry . I don 't believe in Jesus .
 [ chuckles ]
 Jesus is with you .
 I hope I didn 't offend him .
 - No . - [ man ] Hallelujah !
 [ pastor ] Hallelujah !
 You did give me consent , right ? I 'm kind of worried you didn 't .
 Yes , Otis . I definitely said yes .
 When I 'm sad , I make out with nerdy boys .
 It was 100 percent intentional .
 Why nerdy boys ?
 Because they think they 're in love with me , which feels amazing , until they get clingy and want to show me all their things .
 I don 't think I 'm in love with you .
 Sure you don 't .
 Was I ... Was I okay at the sex bit ?
 - It was kind of my first time . - You 're a virgin ?
 Well , I was .
 You weren 't great , but you weren 't terrible .
 You kept asking me if I was okay .
 - It 's important to check in . - It was every ten seconds .
 Were you sad because of your dad ?
 Yeah , a bit .
 He had to quit his job , and my mum 's really stressed about it .
 But mainly I was upset because I over- plucked my left eyebrow , and I 'd just got them symmetrical .
 They look very even to me .
 Thank you for checking in . A lot of guys don 't .
 There must be something we all like .
 - Chocolate ? - Yes .
 No .
 Let 's just tell Miss Sands that we resent being grouped together and forced to bond on the basis of our gender .
 Or I could pretend I like chocolate .
 I know you are comfortable with being dishonest , but I 'm not .
 What 's that supposed to mean ?
 You pretend to be all radical and feminist , when you 're just a girl who goes around stabbing other girls in the back .
 - It 's not true . - So , you didn 't try
 - and steal my boyfriend then ? - Can we not fight ?
 Shut up . It just got interesting .
 I didn 't try and steal your boyfriend , Ola . I had to tell him how I felt .
 You didn 't have to , Maeve .
 You chose to . Did you even like Otis ?
 Or did you just want to win ? You 're a snake .
 [ Maeve ] Yeah ? At least I don 't pretend to be so sweet and nice all the time .
 [ Maeve and Ola ] You don 't know anything about me !
 Stop fighting over a stupid boy !
 Aimes , why are you crying ?
 [ breathing shakily ]
 Because I can 't get on the bus .
 [ Maeve ] Oh , Aimes . It 's okay .
 It 's okay .
 [ sighs ]
 Um , can I come and see you ?
 I ... I 'm ...
 I didn 't know who else to talk to .
 You can all stop looking at me now .
 So you can 't get on the bus because you think that man 's gonna be on it again ?
 [ Viv ]
 No .
 It 's more that he had this really kind face .
 I remember because he smiled at me , and he didn 't look like some wanking psycho killer .
 So it 's , like , if he could do something like that , then anyone could .
 I always felt safe before , and now I don 't .
 - Probably sounds stupid . - It doesn 't sound stupid .
 I was groped at the train station last year .

 [ laughing ]

 So , I sometimes feel funny in crowds too .
 It was like they thought my body was theirs or something .
 Yeah , like we 're public property .
 A few years ago , some boys were catcalling me .

 because fuck them .
 Good . Why should you have to change your behavior because of what they did ?
 [ Maeve ] Exactly .
 I used to go to the local swimming pool all the time when I was a kid .

 [ laughing ]
 I told my mum about it , and she wouldn 't let me go back anymore .
 It 's sad because the pool was my favorite place to go .
 - That 's so unfair .
 - I guess , but statistically , two thirds of girls experience unwanted sexual tension or contact in public spaces before the age of 21 .
 So , it 's not unusual .
 Why are some men so obsessed with getting their dicks out ?
 Sometimes I go on Chat Roulette , and there are so many flaccid penises on there .


 I think if I had an extra arm growing in between my legs ,
 - I might want to show everyone too . - [ Maeve ] Yeah .
 - Maybe it 's a power thing . - Yeah .
 I think the man on the bus liked that I was afraid .
 A man followed me home from work about a year ago .


 He ran off when he saw my dad , which made me angry because I don 't want to be dependent on another man to protect me .
 - I 'm sorry that happened to you . - You too .
 Thank you .
 At least we can go home now .
 Dicks .
 [ chuckles ]
 - I 'll tell you who loves ginger nuts .
 - Yeah ? - Eric Clapton . - Really ?
 - Absolutely loves them . - Are you joking ?
 Stop !

 [ stammers ] I only did it 'cause I love you , and I found out you love him .
 He can 't offer you what I can , miss .
 I have an innate appreciation for older women , and I can roll a joint into the shape of a swan .
 That is problematic on so many levels , but I must say the lipstick was an ingenious touch .
 - You really think so ? - It 's not happening , Kyle . Okay ?
 Follow me .
 - I love you . - [ Mr. Hendricks ]
 Now !
 [ Adam ] Sit .
 - Stand . - I don 't believe it .
 Sit .
 [ whimpers ]
 It 's a miracle .
 Ha !
 You 're a smart boy . Why aren 't you in school ?
 I 'm no good at school .
 Yes , well , you carry on like this , you 're looking at employee of the month .
 Huh ?
 I 'm going to go to the movies tonight , so you can lock up for me .
 I 'm going to go and get ready .
 [ door opens , closes ]
 Girls ...
 I 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .
 We 've found the culprit . You may go home now .
 I 'm very sorry for wasting your time .
 [ Viv ] Well , great . I knew it .
 Oh , out of curiosity , what did you come up with ?
 What binds you together ?
 Other than non- consensual penises , miss , not much .
 - Are you gonna be okay ? - I think so .
 I don 't feel sad , I just feel angry .
 I know something that might help .
 [ Rahim ] I like your family . They 're sweet .
 What do you mean " sweet " ?
 The way they believe in all that God stuff .
 They think it 's real .
 I believe in it too .
 Yeah , but not properly .
 - You pretend to keep the peace , right ? - No .
 No , I believe in God , Rahim .
 How can you believe in a god that doesn 't think you should exist ?
 Okay , this is awkward .
 No , my family had to leave their country because of religion .
 It just doesn 't make any sense to me .
 - I didn 't know that . - It 's okay .
 It 's our differences that make me love you .
 We 'll agree to disagree .
 Love ?
 Does that freak you out ?
 No , no , no . Uh ...
 I ... I love you too .
 - I think my heart stopped for a moment .
 - [ laughs ]
 Let 's go .
 I just cannot believe he 's been taking all that money from all those other students .
 I feel like I don 't know him at all , like ...
 like I 've got a stranger living in my house .
 I think we can 't ever truly know these creatures that we created .
 - Well , perhaps you 're right . - Talk to him .
 That 's all you can do .
 Hey .
 Want to get something to eat after this ... with me ?
 I 'm afraid I can 't do that , Jean .
 It was one stupid kiss .
 You really can 't forgive me ?
 You know ...
 I may not be as intellectual as your ex- husband , but I do know my boundaries .
 I can 't go through that kind of pain again .
 I 'm not sure if I could get up .
 - My girls need me . - Mm .
 Mm .
 You 're not ready for the kind of intimacy I 'm looking for .
 Understood .
 Goodbye , Jakob .
 Yeah .

 - [ knocking at door ] Come in .
 - Dinner is in ten minutes . - Okay .
 [ mother sighs ]
 Your thoughts are very loud , Mum .
 - That boy is not right for you . - You don 't think any boy 's right for me .
 It 's not him , it 's you .
 You act like a different person when you 're around him ,
 like you 're trying to be something that you 're not .
 He doesn 't make you sparkle .
 What do I do ?
 Think about something that makes you really , really angry , and then smash it as hard as you can .
 Mmm .
 I 'm angry that I 'm not very good at baking cakes .
 - Yes ! - Woo !
 - Come on . - [ Maeve ] Go on , Aimee !
 I 'm angry that Steve keeps trying so hard to make things better , but he doesn 't understand .
 - Yes ! Come on ! - Woo !
 I 'm angry that a horrible man ruined my best jeans and nobody did anything , and now , I can 't get on the fucking bus !
 - Yeah ! - [ Aimee ] Yes !
 - This is amazing !
 - Woo !
 - Gonna keep smashing stuff ! - Yeah !
 - Yes ! - Give it to them !

 I did try and steal him .
 - I 'm sorry .
 - I did like him ... but I kind of wanted to beat you too .
 Let 's get you home .
 Wanna walk me home ?
 Yeah .
 Hey , Mum .
 Are you all right ? I heard about what happened .
 Otis .
 Have you been giving sex advice to students at school for money ?
 What are you talking about ?
 - Tell me the truth .
 - I am .
 [ sighs ]
 You look just like your father when you lie .
 - Let 's talk about this rationally . - I can 't talk to you right now .
 Mum .
 Oh , shit !
 I didn 't think you wanted to be my friend anymore .

 - I don 't smell like a vanilla pod . - Yeah , you do .

 [ sighs ] All right , 007 , enough .
 God .

 - Hi , Mum . - Fucking arsehole .
 What you doing ?
 - I had to pop back ... - Isaac told me he saw you yesterday .
 I got fired . I didn 't know how to tell you . Um ...
 I felt so ashamed .
 But ... I am looking for something else .
 - Are you using again ? - No , I am not .
 I swear on my life . I swear on your life , on Elsie 's life .
 I 'm clean .
 Please believe me .
 I believe you .
 [ clears throat ]
 Lie to me one more time , and you 're out .
 [ door opens ]
 [ door slams ]
 [ " Seventeen " by Sharon Van Etten playing ]
 What are you doing here ?
 Getting the bus .
 We 're all getting the bus .
 - [ driver ] Are you getting on or what ? - [ Maeve ]
 Give her a minute .
 [ whispering ] It 's just a stupid bus .
 It 's just a stupid bus .
