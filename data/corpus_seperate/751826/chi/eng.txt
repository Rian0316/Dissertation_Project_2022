 What time is he coming ?
 Any time . Should be here now .

 - Perhaps something 's happened to him .
 - You think he 's missed his bus ?
 No , no , no .
 I mean something may have ... happened .
 Who is he , exactly ?

 All I know is he 's an army officer with something to tell me he wouldn 't divulge on the phone .
 - It 's probably nothing . - Perhaps .

 Remember Churchill , the wilderness years ?
 He found out about our military inadequacy from army officers .
 So while he was in the wilderness he could leak stories to the press and embarrass the government .
 I could do that !
 But you 're IN the government .
 Oh , yes !
 ( DOORBELL )
 I 'll get it .
 - Major Saunders ? - Yes , sir .

 Come in .
 Follow me .
 - It 's all right . My wife , Annie . - Good evening .

 - Drink ?
 - Thanks .

 - Scotch ? - Thanks .

 - Sit down . - Thanks .

 - No need to keep thanking me . - Thanks . I mean , sorry .


 - No need to apologise , either . - Sorry . I mean , thanks .


 - Shall I go and let you talk in private ? - Please stay , if that 's OK with you .

 - Yes . No secrets from Annie .
 I tell her everything .
 - Several times , usually !
 - So , is this highly confidential ? - It is , rather , yes .

 - Shall I turn on the radio ?
 - Is there something good on ?
 - In case we 're being bugged . - Oh .
 Is that likely ?

 - Who 's in charge of bugging politicians ?
 - Ah ...
 Yes , come to think of it , I am .
 That 's all right , then .
 Could I say that what I 'm about to tell you I 'm telling you on a personal basis ?

 Fine ... What do you mean , exactly ?
 I 'm telling you personally and not as Minister for Administrative Affairs .
 - But I am Minister of Administrative Affairs .
 - But I 'm not telling you in that role .
 - I 'm telling you as a journalist .
 - Journalist ? I thought you were an army officer ?

 - No , YOU 'RE a journalist . - I 'm a minister .

 But what were you before you became a minister ?
 Your starter for ten , no conferring !
 I get your drift .
 You 're telling me what you 're telling me , though I don 't know yet what you 're telling me , as the former editor of " Reform " .
 Yes . You were a very fine editor .

 - I wouldn 't say that . - You 've often said that !

 But how do I prevent myself , as a minister , from knowing what you 'll tell me as a former editor ?
 I can 't prevent the minister from knowing .
 - He means it 's a question of hats . - Yes .

 I 'm not wearing my ministerial hat tonight , but I ought to warn you , if I need to be told what you tell me , I shan 't hesitate in my duty to keep myself informed !

 Fine .
 Now , who 's in charge of selling British weapons to foreigners ?
 - Bzzz . Hacker , LSE . - Shut up , Annie .


 You wrote an article in " Reform " about the sale of British weapons to undesirable foreigners .
 Yes , it was called " The Dreadful Trade " .
 Perfectly patriotic to manufacture arms for our own defence or our allies ' .
 Although not all our allies are very commendable .
 But we must not sell weapons to bolster the regimes of foreign despots , Nazi dictators ...
 - Or terrorists . - Terroris ...
 Terrorists ?

 Terrorists . As I told you , I 've recently returned from Rome .

 - NATO , wasn 't it ? - A military delegation to NATO .

 While I was there , they showed me something they 'd captured in a raid on a terrorist HQ .
 It was a computerised bomb detonator .
 Very new , very secret , and very lethal .
 - Who showed it to you ? - I can 't possibly say .
 It 's a confidence .
 I see . Computerised bomb detonator ?


 You set it to calculate the weight of the victim , speed of his car , so you 're sure to get him , and you can reprogram it remotely , by radio , after setting it .
 Gosh . I don 't associate Italians with that sort of technology !

 - It wasn 't made in Italy . It was made here .
 - Made in Britain ?

 Under a Ministry of Defence contract and paid for by the British taxpayer .
 - And used by Italian terrorists ? - Yes .

 - Where did they get them ? - That 's what I want to know .

 You haven 't told anybody else ?
 If I make an official report , I have to disclose my sources .
 But if I tell someone near the top of government ...
 Er , AT the top , actually .
 Yes ... that secret British equipment was being supplied to Italian terrorists ,
 - then he would , er ... - Absolutely .

 What would he ?
 Find out how it 's being done .
 The investigation would have to start in Britain at the top level .
 Fine .
 But you told me you were telling me on a personal level .
 Yes , but now you know personally , if not officially , you can use your personal knowledge to start official investigations to get official confirmation of personal suspicions so what you now know personally , but not officially , you will then know officially as well as personally .



 You 're not related to Sir Humphrey Appleby by any chance ?
 - Who ? - Never mind !

 - I felt I had to tell someone . - Absolutely .

 Well , now I know , personally .
 Marvellous .
 Going to do something about it , aren 't you ?
 - Absolutely , indeed I am .
 - Right away ?

 Right away .
 What are you going to do ?
 I 'm going to think about what you 've told me . Right away .

 - And then ?
 - Then I will consider various courses of action .
 - Without delay . - You 'll take action without delay .

 - I will consider taking action without delay .
 - Are you related to Sir Humphrey Appleby ?

 - Like another drink ? - No , I must be off .

 - Can I rely on you to tackle this shocking matter ?
 - Indeed you can .
 - Goodbye . - Goodnight .

 - Goodnight , Major . - Goodnight , sir .

 - What do you think ?
 - You 'll do something ?

 I certainly will , if it 's right .
 But I can 't believe it 's true .
 Could it happen ?

 Couldn 't . Could it ?


 It 's not just that it shouldn 't . It couldn 't .
 And if it could , it wouldn 't .
 Would it ?
 You ARE related to Sir Humphrey Appleby !
 Humphrey , I must talk to you about something which concerns me deeply .
 Really profoundly important .
 The amendment to the order on stock control in government establishments ?
 The procedure for renewal of local authority leaseholds in development areas ?
 No , what concerns me is a great issue really of life and death .
 Shouldn 't that wait till after work ?

 - It is work . - Really ? Please go on .

 How do British armaments manufacturers sell their arms to foreigners ?
 You get an export licence from the Department of Trade .
 Private firms can sell their arms abroad ?
 - Companies and government agencies .
 - To whom ?
 - Foreign governments , usually .
 - Is that all ?
 Well , sometimes you can sell to an arms dealer , third party .
 A man in Manchester buys on behalf of a party in the Channel Islands with contacts in Luxembourg ...
 There 's no real control over who the arms go to in the end ?
 Indeed there is .
 The dealer has to provide an end user certificate which is a signature acceptable to the government that the ultimate customer is an approved user .
 Is that a real guarantee ?
 Would you be surprised if a British aircraft carrier turned up in the Central African Republic ?
 I , for one , Minister , would be very surprised .
 It 's 1, 000 miles inland !
 You know what I mean .
 What about smaller weapons ?
 It 's officially impossible .
 Stringent security , rigorous inspections , meticulous scrutiny .
 You mean it 's all a facade ?
 Ah .
 - I think this conversation should end here .
 - No , it 's as I thought .
 A confidential source has disclosed to me that British arms are being sold to Italian terrorists .
 I see . May I ask who this confidential source was ?

 Humphrey , I said it was confidential .
 Sorry . I naturally assumed that meant you were going to tell me .

 - You don 't seem worried .
 - It happens all the time . It 's not our problem .
 So does robbery with violence .
 Does that worry you ?

 No , Minister . Home Office problem .

 Humphrey , we 're letting terrorists have murderous weapons !
 - WE 'RE not . - Well , who is ?

 Who knows ?
 Department of Trade ? Ministry of Defence ?
 Foreign Office ?
 We , Humphrey , the British government .
 Innocent lives set at risk by British arms in the hands of terrorists .
 Only Italian lives , not British lives , Minister .
 - Could be British tourists abroad . - Tourists ? Foreign Office problem .

 - Humphrey , we have to do something .
 - With respect , we have to do nothing .
 - What do you mean ?
 - The sale of arms abroad is one area of government we do not examine too closely .
 - I have to , now I know . - Say you don 't know .
 - Are you suggesting I lie ?
 - Not you , Minister , no .
 - Well , who should lie ? - Sleeping dogs , Minister .

 - I 'm going to raise this . - No , I beg you .

 A rule of government is never look into anything you don 't have to , never start an enquiry unless you know what its findings will be .
 I can 't believe this ! We 're talking about good and evil .

 - Church of England problem . - No , Humphrey !

 - Our problem . We are discussing right and wrong .
 - I 'm not .
 It 's misuse of government time .

 - Selling arms to terrorists is wrong .
 - Either you sell arms or you don 't .
 If you sell them , they end up with people who can afford them .
 But not terrorists ?
 I suppose we could put a government health warning on the rifle butts !
 " This gun can seriously damage your health . "
 You may take this lightly , but we cannot close our eyes to something as morally wrong as this .
 If you insist on discussing moral issues , something is either morally wrong or it isn 't .
 It can 't be slightly morally wrong .
 - Don 't quibble . - Government isn 't about morality .

 - Really ? What is it about ? - Stability .
 Keeping things going .

 Preventing anarchy . Stopping society falling to bits . Still being here tomorrow .

 - What for ?
 - I beg your pardon ?
 What is the purpose of government if not for doing good ?
 Government isn 't about good and evil . It 's about order or chaos .

 It 's in order for Italian terrorists to get British bombs ?
 - You don 't care ? - It 's not my job to care .
 That 's what politicians are for . My job is to carry out policy .

 - Even if you think it 's wrong ?
 - Almost all government policy is wrong , but ... .. frightfully well carried out !
 Have you ever known a civil servant resign on a matter of principle ?
 I should think not ! What an appalling suggestion !

 For the first time , I fully understand that you are purely committed to means and not ends !
 As far as I 'm concerned , and all my colleagues , there is no difference between means and ends .
 If you believe that , Humphrey , you will go to hell .
 Minister , I had no idea you had a theological bent .
 - You are a moral vacuum . - If you say so , Minister .

 - Time for your lunch appointment . - You 're keeping very quiet , Bernard .

 - What would you do about all this ? - I would keep very quiet .

 - So may we drop the matter of arms sales ?
 - No , we may not !
 I 'm going to tell the Prime Minister personally .
 Make an appointment , Bernard .
 This is the sort of thing he wants to know about .
 I assure you , this is the sort of thing he wants NOT to know about .
 We shall see about that .
 Indeed we will .
 What 's the matter , Bernard ?
 - Nothing really , Sir Humphrey . - You look unhappy .

 - I was wondering if the minister was right .
 - Very unlikely . What about ?


 About ends and means .
 Will I end up as a moral vacuum , too ?

 Oh , I hope so , Bernard .
 If you work hard enough .
 Makes me feel rather downcast .
 If it 's our job to carry out government policies , shouldn 't we believe in them ?
 Oh , what an extraordinary idea !
 - Why ? - Bernard ...

 I have served 11 governments in the past 30 years .
 If I 'd believed in all their policies ,
 I 'd have been passionately committed to keeping out of the Common Market , and passionately committed to joining it .
 I 'd have been utterly convinced of the rightness of nationalising steel and of denationalising it and renationalising it .
 Capital punishment ?
 I 'd have been a fervent retentionist and an ardent abolitionist .
 I 'd have been a Keynesian and a Friedmanite , a grammar school preserver and destroyer , a nationalisation freak and a privatisation maniac , but above all , I would have been a stark- staring raving schizophrenic !

 So what do we believe in ?
 At this moment , Bernard , we believe in stopping the minister from informing the Prime Minister .
 - But why ?
 - Because once the Prime Minister knows there will have to be an enquiry , like Watergate .
 The investigation of a trivial break- in led to one ghastly revelation after another and finally the downfall of a president .
 The golden rule is don 't lift lids off cans of worms .
 - No , Sir Humphrey . - Everything is connected to everything else .

 - Who said that ?
 - The Cabinet Secretary ?
 Nearly right . Actually , it was Lenin .

 How do you stop a Cabinet Minister talking to a Prime Minister ?
 - Interesting question . You tell me .
 - I don 't know .

 Work it out . You 're supposed to be a high- flier .

 Or are you really a low- flier supported by occasional gusts of wind ?
 Well , YOU can 't stop the minister seeing the PM , can you ?
 - I can 't . - Nor can the private office at No .
 10 .

 - Correct . - It has to be someone high up in government .

 - Getting warmer . - Someone close to the PM .

 Someone who can frighten the minister ...
 - The Chief Whip ?
 - Excellent , you 've learnt a lot .
 - So , how do you crack the whip ?
 - I 'm sorry ?

 How do you mobilise the Chief Whip ?
 The minister 's asked me to phone the PM 's private office for an appointment , so if you had a word with the Cabinet Secretary , and he had a word with the diary secretary , and they all had a word with the Whip 's office ... .. then when the minister arrived , the Whip could meet him and say the PM is busy and asked him to have a word with the minister instead .




 Excellent , Bernard .
 You should have taken a degree in engineering !
 - What are you doing ? - You wanted the Cabinet Secretary .
 Now , do you , as the minister 's private secretary , feel obliged to tell the minister of this conversation ? I do , indeed .



 What conversation ?
 Well done , Bernard . You 'll be a moral vacuum yet !


 Ah , Jim .
 My dear chap , how nice to see you .
 - Vic , I was hoping to see the Prime Minister .
 - Yes .
 The PM 's rather busy today . Asked me to see you instead .

 Vic , it 's not a matter for the Chief Whip .
 The PM asked me to have a preliminary conversation and write a background note .
 - Save time later .
 - Oh .
 Well , I 've been given some pretty dramatic information .
 Go on .
 The Italian Red Terrorists are being supplied with top secret bomb detonators made in this country , in a government factory .
 - And you feel you should tell the PM ?
 - Yes , the PM 's head of security .
 I don 't think it 's anything to burden the PM with . Let 's hold it over .

 - Forget all about it ? - That 's my recommendation .

 I 'm sorry , Vic , I can 't accept it . The PM must be told .

 - If the PM is told , there 'd have to be an enquiry . - Exactly .
 Perhaps revealing other undesirable - even hostile - governments
 - had been supplied with British- made arms .
 - Seriously ?

 Perhaps . It might be highly embarrassing to our Cabinet colleagues -
 Foreign Secretary , Defence Secretary , Trade Secretary , and to the PM personally .
 Doing the right thing might be embarrassing sometimes , but that 's no reason for not doing it .
 You know we already sell arms to Syria , Chile , Iran ?
 - It 's officially approved . - You like what they do with them ?

 Well , obviously not entirely .
 - Either you 're in the arms business or you 're not !
 - If being in it means arming terrorists ,
 - we should be out , it 's immoral . - Oh , great !

 Great !
 Is it moral to put 100, 000 British workers out of a job ?
 And exports , two billion a year gone , for starters .
 And votes ?
 Where do you think the government places those weapons contracts ?
 - In marginal constituencies , obviously . - Exactly .

 All I 'm saying is that now that I know , the Prime Minister must be told .
 - Why ?
 - Why ?
 Just because you 've caught something nasty , why do you have to breathe over everyone ?
 Are you happy in the Cabinet ?
 - Yes , of course I am !
 - Do you want to stay in it ?

 ( HE GULPS )
 Well , then ?
 Sorry , Vic , but there is such a thing as duty .
 - Sometimes one must follow one 's conscience .
 - For God 's sake .
 Must you flash about your petty little conscience ?
 Don 't you think anybody else has got one ?

 - Have you no conscience for the government ?
 - Of course !
 The PM is on the verge of signing an international anti- terrorist agreement .
 - I didn 't know . - There 's a lot you don 't know .

 Can 't you see it 's essential to deal with major policy rather than a few arms exporters and terrorists ?
 Yes , I suppose it is just a couple of terrorist groups .
 - Can 't kill that many people , can they ? - Suppose not !

 And you want to blow it all in a fit of moral self- indulgence !
 After all , with the PM thinking about you as the next Foreign Secretary ...
 Do you mean that ?
 Good Lord !
 So if you want to martyr yourself , go ahead and press for an enquiry .
 Feel free to jeopardise everything we 've worked for all these years .
 Obviously it 's appalling if Italian terrorists are getting hold of British weapons , but there is such a thing as loyalty , the common purpose . No , no .



 I suppose one must see these things in a proper perspective .
 - If it was the Ministry of Defence , Board of Trade .
 - Ministry of Defence , Board of Trade problem .
 Foreign Office problem . I can see that now .

 So we can hold it over for the time being ?
 - Don 't want to upset and embarrass the PM !
 - Absolutely not . Definitely not . No .


 Sorry I mentioned it .
 Good man !
 So I thought on balance it was best to leave it at that .
 Let sleeping dogs lie ...
 In the wider interest .
 As a loyal member of the government .
 - Nothing to be gained . Opening a can of worms .
 - The major said they were terrorists .
 Yes , well ...
 - We bombed Dresden . We 're all terrorists .

 - No .
 I mean metaphorically .
 You should meet the Chief Whip . He certainly is !

 - Someone in Britain 's giving bombs to murderers .
 - Selling , not giving .
 - That makes it OK ? - Be serious , Annie .

 An investigation might uncover all sorts .
 I see .
 Investigate if you can catch one criminal , but not if you might catch lots !
 If they 're your Cabinet colleagues , you 're right !
 Government is a very complex business , Annie .
 There are so many conflicting considerations .
 - Whether to do the right thing or wrong thing .
 - Exactly . No ...


 What do you suggest I do ?
 - Take a moral stand .
 - How ?

 - Threaten resignation . - They 'd accept it !

 Then where would I be ?
 If I 'm gone , I 'm not in a position to do any good any more .
 - You 're not doing good now .
 - Resignation may be a sop to our consciences , but it won 't stop terrorists getting British bombs .
 - It might if you tell what you know .
 - What do I know ?

 I 've no hard facts .
 I know it 's going on because nobody 's denied it , but that 's not proof .
 Can 't you see ? I 'm in a real fix .

 I don 't think you realise just how real a fix you 're in .
 This letter arrived today .
 From Major Saunders .
 " Dear Mr Hacker .
 Thank you for seeing me . " Such a relief to have told you about the supply of British weapons to Italian terrorists .
 " I know you will act upon this information as you promised
 " and I look forward to seeing some action taken . "
 You see ?
 What will you do when Major Saunders tells the world he told you about it and you did nothing ?
 - It 's a photocopy . He 's got the original .
 - It was recorded delivery , so you did get it .
 I 'm trapped !
 Completely trapped !
 I can 't tell the PM , I can 't NOT tell the PM .
 - I see .
 - Might we not use the Rhodesia Solution ?

 Bernard , you excel yourself !
 Of course , Minister , the Rhodesia Solution !
 - What 's that ? - Oil sanctions .

 A member of the government was told about sanction- busting .
 - What did he do ? - Told the PM .

 - And ? - He told the PM in a way the PM didn 't hear him . Oh .
 Do you mean I should mumble it in the Division Lobby ?
 - No , Minister , you write a note .
 - Very faint pencil ?

 - Please , be practical . - It 's awfully obvious .
 - Write a note susceptible of misinterpretation .
 - Oh , I see ! " Dear Prime Minister I believe Italian Red Terrorists
 " have secret British bomb- making equipment . " How do you misinterpret that ?

 You can 't . So you don 't write that .

 You use a more circumspect style with no mention of bombs or terrorists .
 - Isn 't that what it 's all about ?
 - Bernard , write this down . " My attention has been drawn to information which suggests possible irregularities under ... "
 Section 1 of the Import , Export and Customs Powers Defence Act 1939c .
 Thank you , Bernard .
 You then suggest that somebody else should do something about it . " Evidence suggests there may be a case for further investigation
 " to establish whether enquiries should be put in hand . "
 Then you smudge it all over . " Nevertheless , it should be stressed that available information is limited
 " and facts could be difficult to establish with any certainty . " - I see .
 - If there 's an enquiry , you 'd be in the clear and everybody would understand the busy PM might not have grasped the implications .
 - They certainly would ! That 's most unclear .
 - Thank you , Minister !

 You arrange for the letter to arrive at No .
 10 on the day the PM has an overseas summit !
 So there is also doubt about whether it was the PM or the acting PM who read the note .
 It 's seen as a breakdown in communication everyone 's cleared and can get on with things .
 - Including the Red Terrorists ! - Exactly ... Bernard !


 I 'll tell you about government .
 You must always try to do the right thing .
 But you must never let anybody catch you trying to do it because doing right 's wrong .
 Right ?

 - Haven 't you had enough , darling ? - There 's still some left in the bottle .

 No , the thing about government is principle .
 And the principle is you mustn 't rock the boat ... .. because if you do , all the little consciences will fall out .
 And you must all hang together .
 Because if you don 't hang together , you 'll all be hanged separately .
 I 'm hanged if I 'll be hanged !
 You know ... politics is about helping others .
 Even if that means helping terrorists .
 Terrorists are others , aren 't they ? Not us , are they ?

 No .
 And you must always follow your conscience , but you must know where you 're going .
 So you can 't follow your conscience .
 ' Cause it may not be going the same way that you are .
 Empty ... Like me .

 - I 'm a moral vacuum . - Cheer up , darling !

 Nothing good comes out of Whitehall . You did what you could .
 - You don 't really mean that .
 - I do .

 - I 'm just like Humphrey and the rest . - That 's not true !

 He 's lost his sense of right and wrong . You 've still got yours .

 - Have l ? - It 's just that you don 't use it much .
 You 're a sort of whisky priest , you at least know when you 've done the wrong thing .
 - Whisky priest ? - That 's right .

 Good .
 - Let 's open another bottle . - We haven 't got one .

 That 's what you think !
 Who said nothing good ever came out of Whitehall ?
 - You want one ? - Yes , Minister .
