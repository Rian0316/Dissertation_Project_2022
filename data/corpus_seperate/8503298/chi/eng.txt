 Maybe I can make up for it by buying you a drink ?
 Sure .

 Get your asses on the dance floor .

 Karl .
 - Hey , Theo .

 However long , it feels longer .
 Is Daisy parking the car ?
 Oh , uh ...
 Me and Daisy , no , we 're not together anymore .
 Oh , God , I 'm sorry .
 No , no , no .
 It 's ... it 's cool , really , we broke up , like , a year ago .
 No clue .
 He ...
 I 'm not on Facebook , so ...
 I can be a dumbass about these things .
 No . Really , it 's all good .
 We 're still friends . Better friends , actually . It 's all very adult .
 - Well , come in , come in .
 - All right .
 - Danny 's out back . - OK .
 [ meat sizzling ] We 're not gonna punch , we 're not gonna kick . OK ?
 - I 'm sorry .
 - Oh , God .
 [ woman ]
 OK , go play , no fighting .
 Goddamn it . Come on .
 Can 't beat a little home cooking .
 [ Karl laughs ] - Hey , man . - What 's going on ?
 Oh , wow , handshake ?
 What am I , like , infected or something ?
 Fuck you .
 [ laughs ] Come on , get in here , man .
 Ah , that 's better , let it out , buddy , let it out .
 You 're still an asshole , I see .
 Happy birthday .
 Oh , wow . When did you start using gift bags ?
 The store did that .
 You gonna open it ?


 Newest instalment . Came out just yesterday .
 I was in the store ,
 I saw it and ...
 Oh , man . [ laughs ]
 This takes me back .
 It says here you need one of those VR add- ons .
 - I don 't have one of those .
 - Yes , you do .
 - No .
 - Eh ...
 No .
 No , come on , man .
 No .
 It 's your birthday , just take the damn thing , would you ?
 Seriously , you gonna flip the fuck out .
 I tried it out in the store .
 They demoed it for me .
 Five minutes blew my mind to confetti .
 - Thanks , man .
 - It 's all good .
 That your one ?
 No , that 's Maxwell .
 [ Simon ] Maxwell . Guys , guys .
 Tyler 's friend from school .
 - You want a beer , man ?
 - Finally he saves me .
 Yes .
 Thank you .
 [ girl ]
 Mommy , Mommy , Mommy , I 've been playing with Katie .
 [ woman ] Theo , are we using the plastic cups ?
 Theo 's looking good .
 Uh- huh .
 Good to see at least one of you still has a gym membership .
 Oh , really ?
 Seriously , man .
 You 're walking around like a fucking Frankenstein movie .
 Look , since my knee went , I haven 't been able to work out , all right ?
 I 'm not using that as an excuse .
 I 'm just ... - No , no , no , of course not .
 - Hey , fuck you , all right ?
 I can afford to let things slide .
 I 'm settled .
 I thank God I don 't have to be out there on the dating scene .
 Always on sale . Fucking bullshit .
 It is like a second job . Gotta keep up with those younger dudes .
 You gotta do a thousand crunches a day ?
 - Only 50 each morning .
 - Fifty in the morning ?
 Mm- hmm . You wax your ballsack ?
 I 'm sure as shit those young dudes do .
 You wax your ball ... You nasty .
 Till it 's gleaming like an eight ball .
 [ both laugh ] Just to stay in the game .
 - I pity you , really .
 - Yeah .
 Well ...
 You wanna know where I 'm going after I leave here ?
 Shit , getting your taint waxed too ?
 Meeting Mariella .
 - Mariella . - She does backing vocals .
 What , for the school band ? How old is she ?
 Twenty- nine .
 No , 28 .
 See .
 Here she is again .
 - Yeah .
 - [ shushes ]
 - You wanna share that with the class ?
 - Mm- mm .
 - You lucky man .
 - I am , me .
 What are you doing ?
 What are you doing ?
 [ laughs ]
 - Tyler asleep ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 Had to read that damn Macaroo book again before he 'd let me put out the light .
 " Macaroo found a shoe ... "
 " And put it in a tree . "
 Macaroo 's got no respect for his environment , that 's all I 'm saying .
 - I can do that .
 - No , I 'm fine .
 Mm- mm .
 It 's your birthday , come on .
 - Thank you .
 - [ grunts ]
 OK .
 You know , you should 've told me that Karl and Daisy broke up .
 - Did he say who broke up with who ? - I didn 't ask .
 I always said that those two were not good news together .
 So long since I saw him last .
 - Had to be last year 's birthday , I think .
 - In the flesh , a whole year ?
 Him and the girl on his phone , is that serious ?
 I didn 't ask .
 Guys suck at talking .
 How long have you two known each other ?
 You don 't actually get to talk at these things , though , do you ?
 I mean , beyond surface bullshit .
 Or parent talk .
 There 's a lot of that these days .
 Y 'all should hang out more .
 Yeah , well , you know , work .
 And we 're parents .
 He 's downtown with the label and we 're out here .
 We should have him over for dinner .
 You could make your chili .
 Sure .

 You gotta put the knives in sharp edge down .

 - I know .
 Check out the Rodman look on this guy .
 How are you ?
 Yeah ?
 Rodman ?
 Dennis Rodman .
 - He used to be a ball player , right ?
 - Right .
 The hair .
 Got it .
 The app says we need to do it within the hour .
 It 's peak fertility .
 I 'm kind of beat but I guess that we should .
 You not into it ?
 I just ate so much , I don 't know if I can .
 - It 's best to save it up , though , right ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 Mind if I go to sleep ?
 No .
 [ Theo groans ]
 I love you , baby .
 Love you , too .

 [ both chuckle ]
 Shit .
 [ TV chimes ]

 - Hey , man .
 - Hey , you still awake ? You wanna game ?
 Maybe not tonight . I was ...
 Come on , what are you playing ?
 Something goddamn boring is what I 'm guessing .
 All right , you got me .
 All right , so grab the experiencer disc I got you , put it on and jump in .

 You 're gonna freak .
 You 're gonna shit your pelvis through your asshole .
 - OK . What do I do ?
 - All right , they showed me in the store .
 - You put the game chip in .
 - Done .
 Now grab the disc doohickey and stick it upside your head .
 - Left or right side ?


 - OK . Now hold down the sync button on the controller .
 Nothing 's happening .
 We haven 't chosen our fighters yet .
 So , I am ...
 [ game ]
 OK , so where 's my guy ?
 - [ game ]
 - Damn .
 All right , Lance , let 's go .
 OK , you have to brace yourself .
 Brace myself . Come on .
 - You ready ?
 - Yeah , I 'm ready .
 Three , two ... - one .

 [ Danny ]
 Whoa !
 [ Danny ] Oh , my God .
 [ Danny ]
 Whoa !
 [ Danny 's voice melds into Lance ] This is crazy .
 - What the fuck ... ?
 - Yo , Danny .
 Said you gotta brace yourself .
 Karl ?
 Crazy shit , huh ?
 Like , I feel solid .
 You think your chest is impressive ?
 Check this shit out .
 [ Karl as Roxette ]

 - This is just ... - I know , right ?
 How 's the knee ?
 Pretty good .
 - [ Roxette grunts ]
 - [ Lance chuckles ]
 Man , in here , you can do so much shit you can 't do out there .
 [ roars ]
 OK , enough of the Captain Acrobat shit .
 - You ready to fight ? - I 'm ready .

 [ Danny as Lance ] Whoa . Hold on a minute .
 Is this going to hurt ?
 " The game emulates all physical sensations . "
 Is that a yes or a no ?
 It does .
 [ both grunt ]
 Peace out .
 I 'm gonna fuck you up .
 Thunder punch .
 Windmill wipe- out .
 [ laughs ]
 That the best you can do , man ?
 Jesus Christ .
 Don 't worry , it resets . No harm done .
 That 's messed up .
 [ game ]
 - Hold on .
 Shit , I 'm rusty .
 I can 't remember what moves this guy can do .
 It 's like riding a bike .
 - See ? Nice block .
 - Thanks .
 Hyperstrike !
 That 's double .
 Tornado fury .

 [ beeping ] That 's my cab .
 - Good night , little man .
 - Good night . - Take care of Daddy for me , OK ?

 Depends on traffic , I guess . Have fun , OK ?

 Hey . I can 't play long , I ...
 Oh , sure , me too . [ Danny ]

 Last time we played , I was drunk , man , from the party .
 Me , too .
 Cool .
 OK .
 Be good to have a serious game , you know ?
 Serious game .

 Here we go .
 About to kick your ass , motherfucker .
 Yeah ?
 You 're gonna try .

 [ Roxette shouts ]
 - Come on , come on ! Please , please ! - Stop it !
 No !
 I 'm going .

 Can you hear me ?
 Yes .
 Can you hear me now ?
 You 're the driver , right ?
 Yeah , I 'm outside of the Taphouse .

 So , guess that 's us gay now .
 That 's a joke .
 Huh .
 Don 't feel like a gay thing .

 What ?
 You 're supposed to be in bed . I 'm thirsty .

 Yes what ?
 - Yes , thank you .

 - [ Tyler ]
 Hey , Mom .
 - [ Theo ]
 Hey there , little man .
 - Looks like you can use one of these .
 - Mm- hmm .
 Feels like a dog died in my damn head .
 [ both chuckle ]
 You weren 't supposed to drink .
 I figured my period was late . And I hoped it was .
 And then it came on while I was out , so .
 I just said fuck it .
 I 'm sorry .
 Next time .
 Nose kiss .

 [ Roxette grunts ]
 I 'm sorry , baby .
 I 'm just tired , OK ?
 [ horns honking ]
 [ Karl as Roxette ]
 OK , I know when you 're thinking .
 What 's up ?
 How does it feel ?
 I mean , like , for you , being in a woman 's body while ...
 Crazy .
 It 's crazy .
 I mean , it 's different .
 Like ... the physical feeling of it ?
 It 's more sort of ...
 satisfying .
 I can 't really explain it .
 Like , one 's a guitar solo , the other 's a whole fucking orchestra .
 But the tune 's basically the same .
 Different tempos , though .
 Yeah , I think you 've run that analogy to the ground .
 Fuck you .

 I 'd like you to push my feet down . Listen here , mister .
 Listen here .

 - Hey . - Hi .
 Can I , uh ...
 Should I not ?
 I was just gonna ask if I could buy you a drink .
 - I 'm sorry .
 - Oh , God . - Yeah .
 - I 'm so sorry .
 Don 't be .
 - No , seriously .
 - Seriously .
 [ both laugh ]
 I 'll leave you alone .
 Mm- hmm .
 Sorry .
 Hey .
 - [ waiter ] It 's all good ? - It was great , thank you .
 Your dessert 's on the way .
 That was good .
 Hmm .
 - Mm- hmm .
 - [ Theo chuckles ]
 You know the thing about you ?
 Sometimes you just sort of go away .
 - What do you mean ? - I mean , you shrivel away .
 You go inside .
 Leave me on the outside .
 Are you in there ?
 [ exhales ]
 Of course I am .
 OK . So then , what 's up ?
 Nothing .
 We haven 't done it in weeks .
 I 've been tired .
 - We 're meant to be trying again .
 - We are trying again . No .
 Won 't get pregnant if you don 't fuck me , Danny .
 Jesus .
 It 's not that I don 't want to .
 I said I 've been tired .
 I 'm sorry ... but is something going on ?
 Something going on ? That 's what I said .
 Nothing is going on .
 Then what is it ?
 - Is it me ?
 - No . - You don 't touch me anymore .
 - Theo . You don 't even kiss me .
 There is none of the small stuff .
 Squeeze my shoulder .
 A hand on my back as you pass me in the kitchen .
 - Theo . - Not even that .
 Do you want me any more ?
 I 'll always want you . No .
 You know what I mean , I mean , me . This . This .
 I know that I 'm not what I was .
 My body is not what it was since Tyler .
 Don 't say that .
 Are you seeing someone ?
 No .
 No .
 So why don 't you want me ? You always used to want me .
 [ breathes shakily ]

 It 's boring , I get that .
 Family life ?
 Shit , I find it boring .
 But I am loyal .
 I 'm loyal to our family . I 'm loyal to you .
 God knows if I wanted , I could go out and do whatever .
 You think I haven 't made sacrifices ?
 I haven 't denied things for myself ?
 A guy at the bar earlier tried hitting on me .
 Half of me wanted him to , just for some excitement , some fucking passion .
 But that is what you do .
 It 's part of being in a partnership , you shut the door on all that shit .
 You shut it out because you have committed .
 It 's what a commitment is .
 Oh , God . If something 's going on , I just ...
 I just want to know .
 I 'll deal with it how I deal with it .
 I just have to know .
 Nothing is going on .
 I promise .
 I swear .
 [ waiter ] One chocolate bombe .
 And two spoons .
 Enjoy .
 - [ Karl grunts ] - [ Mariella ]
 That 's it .
 That 's good .
 Sorry .
 I 'm not gonna get there .
 You 're worrying about your work again ?
 I think so .
 OK .
 Mind if I finish myself off ?
 Mm .

 [ phone vibrates ]

 [ phone rings ]
 Hold on . Excuse me , I gotta take this .

 Hello .
 Hey .
 Whoa , what do you mean ? It means I can 't do it anymore .
 It 's not fair to Theo .
 [ haltingly ] But it 's not cheating .
 It 's not real . It 's like ... porn or something .


 - I gotta think of Theo .

 we don 't have to completely cut it off .
 What about , like , first Sunday of each month ?
 - No . - Just now and then .
 Karl , it has to stop .
 Clean break .
 Come on . This is good . This is good .
 You know it is .
 Look , I gotta go .
 - I 'm sorry .

 - Goodbye .



 [ Danny ] I gotta get past you , you ready ?
 Go .
 [ Danny ]
 All right .
 [ Danny ]
 You win .

 [ phone chimes ]
 [ Danny ] And he is down .
 - Macaroo found that shoe again , huh ?
 - And put it in a tree .
 Happy birthday .
 - Oh !
 - Sorry it 's not much . I couldn 't get out .
 - It 's exactly what I wanted .
 - [ laughs ] Thank you .
 That smells good .
 It 's the sort of red- meat caveman food you like .
 - Yeah . That 's a hell of a serving size .
 - Yeah . You having your hunger pangs again ?
 - There 's three of us eating tonight .
 - I know , that 's what I said . I mean , three adults .
 I invited Karl over .
 Surprise .
 Karl ?
 Yeah , well , last year you said you hardly got to see him .
 You didn 't get to speak to him at that barbecue we had .
 So I emailed him last week .
 And what did he say ?
 He said he was looking forward to it .
 [ doorbell buzzes ]
 Speak of the devil .

 [ Theo ]

 He had a point , though , because we were loud . [ Danny ]
 Mm- hmm .
 Baby , you remember the time that you got that molly and you insisted that we all take it ?
 I had to go to work the next day .
 - [ Karl laughs ]
 - Lord .
 We were young , I guess .
 Well .
 Hennessey and dessert is as crazy as it gets now .
 Speaking of dessert , it 's almost ready .
 What the fuck are you doing ?
 - Just eating .
 - That 's not what I mean , OK ?
 Why the fuck did you come ?
 She asked me to come . What do you want me to say ?
 - An excuse . - Such as what ?
 Such as anything .
 What am I ? Your ex- wife or something ?
 Look , it 's too strange , OK ?
 It 's just too fucking strange .
 I 'll tell you what 's strange .
 Nothing matches it , does it ?
 I tried replacing it , man .
 I tried .
 I tried fucking the computer- controlled characters . - It 's bullshit .
 - Shut up . It 's like a rubber doll .
 Not programmed for any sex stuff . They just sort of lie there .
 I tried it with real players .
 Other folks controlling Lance .
 There was this one guy from Holland .
 He was kind of halfway OK as long as I didn 't think about this accent .
 But it didn 't get me .
 It didn 't get me , not like when we 're in there .
 You and me .
 Stop it .
 I tried everything .
 I 've gone in there as guy players , girl players , multi- player gangbangs , you name it .
 You know , I even fucked Tundra , the polar bear character .
 I fucked a polar bear and I still couldn 't get you out of my mind .
 I can 't help you .
 You want to fuck Roxi again .
 - I don 't . - You do .
 - Just ... - The best sex of my life .
 Best of yours too . Fucking transcendent . You know it was .
 Think about it .
 Think about her .
 Roxi .
 Holding her , her warm skin against yours .
 - Please . - Her tight wet pussy .
 - Fuck , man .
 - She 'll be in there at midnight .
 Just come on in one last time . You know you want to . One last time .

 What y 'all doing ?
 [ chuckles ]
 - Bullshit .
 - Bullshit , yeah . That looks good .
 Baby , your plate .
 - Is that your tiramisu ?
 - Mm- hmm .
 You know it .
 World famous .
 Good to see you .
 Happy birthday , man .
 It was good to see you .
 Yeah , you , too .
 Lord , hug each other .
 Guys can be so awkward .
 Midnight .
 - Bye . - Good night .
 [ Danny sighs ]
 [ Roxette grunts ]
 I love this .
 I love you .
 No .
 No .
 No . No !
 - I don 't know where that came from .
 - Where the fuck does this go ?
 [ shouts ]
 You 're feeling it , too .
 Just say it .
 Say it .
 What the fuck do you want ?
 Where does this end ?
 Who says it has to end ?
 Huh ?
 [ shouts ]
 - You remember the Year Club ?
 - Danny . The old club , the Year .
 Of course I do , why ?
 Car lot out back .
 Meet me there in 30 minutes .
 Exit game .

 - OK . - We 're not gonna fight .
 We 're gonna kiss .
 Kiss ?
 Like ... kiss .
 It 's the only way . We gotta know .
 Know ...
 If there are fireworks , then , OK , bam , it 's an " us " thing , whatever .
 At least we 've got a foothold on it .
 So let 's just fucking kiss .
 OK .
 I said OK . I 'm working up to it .
 - You want me to start ? - I don 't know .
 Yeah .
 OK .
 You ready ?
 Just fucking kiss me , man .
 Nope .
 Not a damn thing .
 No , me neither .
 Huh .
 So that settles it .
 You know it 's different in the game . No .
 You got to get that shit out of your head .
 - It ain 't coming out . - No .
 - It 's burrowed right in there .
 - No , fuck you . Burrowed right in there , man .
 - I know it , you know it . - Hey . Hey .
 It 's buried in there , huh ?
 - Maybe we can get rid of it like that . - Don 't push me , man .
 - You a big man ? What you gonna do ?
 - Don 't push me . What you gonna do ?
 OK .
 Stop .
 Stop !
 Stop !
