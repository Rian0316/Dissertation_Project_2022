 00 : 01 : 14, 734 -- > 00 : 01 : 16, 561 Sorry about the hiccup , folks .






















 Won 't be long .


 You got five minutes .

 Howdy , folks !
 Can someone tell me if Mrs. Alma May Urbano is on board ?
 Alma May Urbano ?
 There you are !
 Hello , dear .
 Very good to meet you .
 My name 's Jimmy .
 I tried to visit you at Sandpiper , but they wouldn 't allow me to .
 Hey , you know what ?
 It doesn 't matter .
 I saw your bus broken down .
 Here you are ! Lucky me !
 Do you prefer to be called
 Mrs. Urbano or Alma May or just plain Alma ?
 My last name is McGill , but you can call me Jimmy .
 Hey , everyone .
 My name 's Jimmy McGill ,
 I 'm an attorney at law . But ... Don 't mind me .
 Just talk amongst yourselves .
 Now , Alma May , do you recall responding to a mailer from my law firm ,
 Davis & Main of Santa Fe , New Mexico ?
 I ... I don 't know .
 We were looking to help any Sandpiper residents who may have been overcharged for basic goods and services .
 Now , does that ring a bell ?
 Oh !
 Maybe .
 Was it yellow ?
 It 's canary yellow .
 I picked that color myself !
 Well , ma 'am , I 'm here to make sure you get your money back .
 What 're you talking about ?
 Who took Alma May 's money ?
 Uh , well , that 's a very good question .
 And thank you for asking , Mister ...
 Amos . Amos Lydecker .
 Mr. Lydecker , Jimmy McGill .
 Now , nobody took anybody 's money , exactly .
 It 's not like the Sandpiper people , you know , put on a ski mask and mugged Alma May here at gunpoint .
 Okay ?
 So , I want you to put that mental image right out of your head .
 See , what we 're talking about here is more of a ...
 It 's just a discrepancy .
 It 's just a little thing .
 It 's fairly innocent .
 But , we need to fix it .
 You follow me ?
 Well , put it this way .
 Alma May , let 's say you 're out on a date with your boyfriend .
 You do have a boyfriend , right ?
 Ah ! You don 't ?
 Come on !
 Alma May 's holding out on me .
 Do you have a nephew ?
 Nephew ? Oh , yes .
 Steve .
 Okay , Steve , is he a good guy ?
 Yes , very good .
 Okay .

 So let 's say you and Steve go out to dinner at , well , Birdie 's .
 That 's where you 're all headed today , right ?
 All right .
 So , both of you have a great meal .
 Chicken fried steak and green beans , and it 's all perfect .
 Here comes the check ...
 " Hey , wait a dog- gone , 24 bucks for a side of buttermilk biscuits ? "
 - That doesn 't sound right now , does it ? - No . No , it does not .
 It sounds like something got added up wrong .
 Well naturally , you send your nephew , Steve , to talk to the manager .
 And naturally , the manager corrects the mistake .
 And what 's more , he gives you a coupon for a free meal next time you come in .
 How about that !
 Well , that same kind of thing is what happened at Sandpiper Crossing .
 And nothing makes me sadder than to see people of the Greatest Generation , people like my own Nana and Bobo , getting overcharged by some great big company .

 Even if it was an accident .
 Now , I know that the good people at Sandpiper want to make this right .
 Sooner or later . But you know what ?
 Well , sometimes , it 's just easier if you get your nephew , Steve , to go take care of it for you .
 And that 's how I want you to think of me .
 Georgiana .
 Hey there , Georgie Girl .
 Thank you . Oh !
 It 's all there , everything I need .
 Thank you so much .
 Enjoy your lunch .
 Alma May .
 You did it . Thank you so much .
 Thank you .
 Thank you , Henry .
 All right .
 Hey , Sue ... Okay .
 Beautiful penmanship !
 A lost art ...

 Schweikart and Cokely are pursuing an aggressive strategy , but looking at the relevant case law ,





 I don 't think it 's going to play with this magistrate judge .
 I 've read over a dozen of her rulings , all of which have sided with the plaintiff on cases like this .




 I 've included a memo to that effect in today 's materials , which you can peruse at your leisure .




 Thanks , Erin .


 How about we move on to client outreach ?

 Jimmy ?
 You still with us ?
 Uh ... I 'm going to save you from having to brag .
 Over 200 new Sandpiper clients signed over the past three weeks .
 Well done , Jimmy .
 Thank you .
 Thanks , Cliff .
 Uh , right now , we 're in the process of mapping out the entire Southwest , targeting the largest Sandpiper facilities first .
 Phoenix , Colorado Springs , Fort Worth , Provo .
 That 's just for starters . Ideally , my goal , another 200 by the end of the month .
 With this many folks , we have an excellent shot at a solid batch of plaintiffs for the classes in each district .

 Excellent . Look forward to the next report .
 On to a stickier wicket , coordinating actions .
 Um , sorry . Before we move on .
 I 'd like to go back to client outreach , just for a moment .
 Looking over these numbers , here . Really astonishing results , Jimmy .

 Incredible .
 Your last trip to Amarillo , you came back with 22 new clients ?
 Twenty- four .
 Twenty- four .
 I 'm confused . Um , how many people out there actually responded to our direct mailer ?

 One .
 Hmm .
 Oh , right , yeah .
 A Mars Alma May Urbano .
 But you got 24 new clients from this one response ?
 That is ...
 Wow ! Well , you 're welcome .
 I mean , what , is there a problem ?
 Well , might not some parties , the opposing counsel for example , see this differential and conclude that there may have been some solicitation involved ?


 I did not solicit . I 'm just wondering how you account for your success .
 Because it will definitely raise eyebrows over at Schweikart and Cokely .
 I 'm sorry , but it will .
 Particularly in a case involving seniors for whom the ethical guidelines on solicitation were virtually created by the ABA .
 Chuck , I 'm sure that ...
 Jimmy , if you could clear this up that would be helpful .
 I went to Amarillo to confer with the client and to make sure that we had a solid good- faith basis for our case there .
 Overall .
 As many of you are aware , I 've visited more than my share of retirement homes .
 These are close- knit communities .
 Let me tell you , word gets around real fast .
 Dorothy in Phase 2 gets a new Rascal Scooter , well , it 's big news .
 So these other 23 residents , they approached you ?
 Cliff , they heard the scuttlebutt before I crossed state lines .
 And I certainly didn 't have to go knockin ' on any doors .
 And is it any surprise that they wanna speak with the guy who was there to show them they may have money coming their way ?
 I gotta tell ya , with all that in mind , I should 've done better .
 Makes sense .
 Howard ?

 Chuck ?
 We good to move on ?
 And , Chuck , not incidentally , it is absolutely vital that we dot our I 's and cross our T 's here .
 Invaluable .
 So , thank you . The price of excellence is eternal vigilance .
 Indeed .
 Coordination .
 I believe that 's where we left off . That 's right .
 Brian , this is your thing , so why don 't you take this ?
 Sure .
 Considering the dimensions of these cases , taken together and individually , it makes sense to designate someone to handle the scheduling .
 What I 'm proposing is that we create a small team at D& M dedicated specifically to coordinating all elements of the individual actions .
 We 'll loop in HHM when anything ...
 Brian . I 'm sorry .
 Excuse me for interrupting .
 I just want to say that I take Chuck 's point .
 I do .
 I mean , this is like a " wife of Caesar " type thing .
 There can 't even be a hint of solicitation , so I 'm gonna pull back .
 No more meet- and- greets at Sandpiper facilities .
 I 'll find another way to proceed .
 Well , Jimmy , we 'll leave that up to you .
 You know , client outreach is your department .
 Uh , where was I ?
 Okay , right .
 If we have a more consolidated nerve center here in New Mexico , where the ...
 Hey , Kim , where can I get a copy of that Neiderman deposition ?
 I 've got an extra Neiderman , Jimmy .
 You can have one of mine .
 Oh , wow , thanks , Erin .
 No worries .
 Shoot .
 Where did I put that ?
 Thanks that 's ...
 Man , can you believe Chuck in there ?
 I mean , Jesus .
 Solicitation ?
 Let me tell you , when we were building this case ,
 I was chasing down eighty- year- old mall walkers .
 That was solicitation !
 But did he say " boo " ?
 Bullshit , he did !
 What happened in Texas ?
 Nothing .
 I did my job .
 You didn 't do a song and dance in the day room for the old- timers ?
 No !
 No .
 Not in the day room .
 Jimmy , you know solicitation can get you disbarred .
 This matters .
 Well , here 's what I think matters , twenty- four senior citizens now have representation .
 Before I went they didn 't even know they were getting ripped off .
 Now they have us in their corner .
 How is that not a win ?
 You said in there you 'd find another way .
 Did you mean it ?
 Sure .
 Absolutely .

 Look , I ...
 I need you to understand something very critical here .
 Shoot .
 I put myself on the line to get you this job .
 Okay .
 I thought it was because I 'm sensational with old people .
 Yeah , and who do you think told them that ?
 So what you threw me a bone ?
 No . Asshole .
 You know I believe in you .
 But then I made my beliefs known to them .
 Now everything you do reflects back on me . With Howard .
 Because ultimately , I talked him into going out on a limb for you , too .
 Do you understand ?
 It 's , it 's my word . It 's my judgment .
 Yeah .
 You and I both know you can do this job .
 But please , you just have to do it right .
 Well ...
 You wanna make sure you put in the batteries the right way . Or it won 't work .
 Then you close him up .
 And ...
 I think ... I think you 're good to go , young lady .
 Why don 't you give his foot a squeeze ?
 He 's funny !
 Oh , darling ...
 I think I 'll name you ...
 Mr. Snuggles .
 Are you hungry ?
 I 'm gonna get you some mashed potatoes .
 That should get you through to next month .
 Mike , thank you .
 But you shouldn 't feel that you need to ...
 Too late .
 Something up ?
 Feels like something 's up .
 No .
 It 's ...
 I didn 't get much sleep .
 My head 's ... I 'm sorry .
 You tell me it 's none of my business , I 'll drop it .
 I don 't want you to worry .
 Not the worrying kind .
 Last two nights , I heard gunshots .
 First night , they were maybe a block or two over .
 Woke me up .
 My first thought was firecrackers ,
 I mean , that 's what I assumed at the time .
 But then last night ... There 's no mistaking it . There was three of them .
 They were quick .
 Pop , pop , pop Closer .
 It was like they were right outside the house .
 You call the cops ?
 Yeah .
 Took 'em over an hour to get here , then they looked around for a whole two minutes .
 But by then , of course , there was nothing to see .
 I 'm staying here tonight . No , Mike .
 No , that 's not necessary .
 It is not a problem .
 I 'll take the couch .
 Mike , you asked , so I answered .
 Please , don 't make me sorry I told you .
 Kaylee , come , hmm ?
 Get your supper .
 What about Colorado Springs ?
 Um ...
 Two hundred and eighty- three residents , and ... We sent out 283 mailers .
 Yeah , and how many response cards came back ?
 Zero .
 Zero ?
 Son of a bitch .
 Dana , Toni .
 Have a good one .
 You too , Mr. Main .
 Cliff , uh , can I have a second ?
 What 's up ? Uh , it 's those Sandpiper mailers .
 We should be getting responses of like 12 to 15 % .
 But we 're getting ones and twos .
 In Colorado Springs , zero .
 Wow !
 How can that be ?
 I 'm thinking it 's the staff .
 They 're tossing the mailers before they can reach the residents .
 Maybe they got told to do it by the Sandpiper front office .
 Which would be actionable as hell .
 If we could prove it .
 Big " if . "
 And to do so would take more manpower than I can spare .
 For now , let 's just stick with getting those client numbers up .
 Guess you 'd better think of another way .
 I think I got it .
 TV commercial .
 Highly targeted .
 Let me tell you , at Sandpiper , the trains run on time .
 Mussolini would be proud .

 Every one I 've visited so far , same exact schedule .
 10 : 00 a . m . , water aerobics , 2 : 00 p . m . , line dancing .
 So on , and so forth .
 They always leave 3 : 00 p . m . to 4 : 00 p . m . free .
 Why ?
 It 's been in syndication since , like , the 1850s .
 And let me tell you , when that thing comes on ?
 It draws the blue- hairs like moths to a bug zapper .
 3 : 14 p . m . , end of the first act cliff- hanger .
 First commercial up , Davis & Main .
 Guaranteed eyeballs . Lots of 'em .
 There 's nothing Sandpiper can do about that .
 We ran a commercial a few years back , another class action case .
 Kind of a new thing for us .
 It 's not exactly my go- to , but generally speaking , I 'm open to it .
 We will talk next week .
 Great !
 Safe travels .






 I remember they worked real hard to get that just right .
 To get what just right ?
 Oh , the swirl .
 They wanted it kind of nebulous , but not too nebulous .
 Then there was the issue of the speed .
 I remember there were a lot of meetings about that .
 I 'll bet .


 Cliff signed off on this ?
 The partners were very happy .
 What do you think ?
 I think ...
 Whatever happened to showmanship ?
 Yo . Check it out .
 Ricola !
 Ricola ! Hey !
 Would you two ass- clowns act like the professionals your parents are paying for you to become ?
 This happens to be very valuable .
 Yeah ?
 What is it ?
 This one is the Alpine Shepherd Boy . It 's for her nephew .
 So , come on .
 Join me . Production meeting .
 Bring it in .
 All right .
 Now look , teamwork makes the dream work .
 Together , we can make something , dare I say it , bravura .
 And this is a golden opportunity , especially for you guys ,
 ' cause it 's gonna play all around the Southwest .
 So , who knows what it could lead to ?
 Better lead to 100 bucks each .
 What is it with you and money ?
 Saving up for a VX2000 . Hey ! Pop quiz .
 What do we three have in common with the greats ?
 Welles , Fellini , Bergman .
 The biggies .
 What ?
 All three of them , to a man , worked in the highly lucrative , creatively rewarding field , of advertising .
 And tonight , we join them .
 This is heady stuff , right ?
 Okay .
 So , pay attention .
 We open on granny , and she is rocking .
 So she 's back and forth ...
 Just very back and forth .
 And then , very slowly and smoothly , the camera , uh ...
 Moves towards ... Dolly ?
 A dolly .
 Good , yeah .
 You see a dolly here ?
 You guys didn 't bring a dolly ?
 Nope . No dolly .
 You didn 't ask for a dolly . Gotta ask , dude .
 Dolly 's extra .
 It 's true .
 Okay . No dolly .
 Um .
 We will improvise then .
 Stay with me .
 She 's rocking , she 's shivering , she 's clutching at a tattered shawl .
 They turned the heat off on her , these evil bastards .
 She 's cold and hungry , she 's friendless .
 This is heart- rending stuff , man .
 Okay .
 It 's a one- er . And it 's shot in glorious black and white .
 We can do that , right ?
 Yeah .
 So , that 's it ?
 Old lady in a chair ?
 That 's your commercial ?
 Does anybody like you ?
 I 'm ready for my close- up , Mr. McGill !














 Morning .
 Hey , honey , what 's happening ?
 What 's wrong ?
 What happened ?
 Where 's Kaylee ?
 She 's at school .
 She 's fine , she doesn 't know about it .
 Are you all right ?
 Let me show you .
 It 's up , it 's up there .
 You see it ?
 It 's right up there .
 You see that ?
 You see the shape of it ?

 You do see it , right ?
 I see it .

 What time did you hear the shots ?
 2 : 13 this morning .
 I looked at the clock .
 It was three of them , It was exactly like last time .
 And you didn 't call the police ? Or did you ?
 No . I ...
 What 's the point ?

 Um ...
 I 'm thinking outside the box , but ...
 Do you think maybe it 's possible that you dreamed it ? It happens sometimes .
 I didn 't dream it , Mike , because I didn 't sleep a wink last night .
 That came from a bullet .
 I mean , it must have , it wasn 't there before last night , I promise you that .
 And I , I don 't know what to ...
 Okay .
 Okay .
 Jesus .
 I mean , I was here .
 I was here and you weren 't .
 I believe you .
 I believe you .
 All right .
 That 's it .
 We 're getting you and Kaylee out of this house .
 End of story .
 You ever wonder about these things ?
 What things ? This .
 Like , what 's the story with these ?
 Who was it who first said , " Hey , I know , a big bowl of balls ! "
 I don 't know .
 They came with the place .
 No shit .
 They 're in every corporate apartment in the world .
 They 're like the Gideon Bible . Hey .
 Don 't be jealous of my big bowl of balls .
 It 's unbecoming .
 Why do they all have to have empty vases ?
 Well , it 's the law .
 Plus , it 's a metaphor .
 I gotta say , I will miss the nail salon 's vibrating chairs .
 For you , I can make any chair in this place vibrate .
 You ready for this ?
 Okay , here it goes .
 You 're 86 years old , you 're a resident of Sandpiper , Colorado Springs .
 You just finished your afternoon snack , lime Jell- O.
 Lime . Got it .
 You 're in the day room , you 're watching your favorite TV program .
 And what 's this ?
 There 's been another murder in Cabot Cove ?
 No ! Yes !
 The sheriff is in over his head .
 And once again , Jessica Fletcher has to put aside the novel she 's been writing , and assist law enforcement .
 Shocker !
 The killer left behind a cryptogram . And commercial .









 That 's not a real tear is it ?
 It 's Visine .



 Well ?
 You made that ?
 With some film students ?
 I directed .
 It looks professional .
 And ?
 And if I were an 86- year- old Sandpiper resident ,
 I 'd be dialing .
 Yes !
 Up top .
 And all made in accordance with the rules and regulations of the American Bar Association .
 Good .
 I can 't believe Davis & Main went for it .
 Well , I 'm in charge of the department .
 Yeah , but still you know ... Cliff Main was fine with this .
 Why wouldn 't he be ?
 No , it 's ... No , It 's fantastic !
 Let 's celebrate .
 I 'm getting more wine .
 You want some ?
 Absolutely .



 Colorado Springs , Colorado .
 Yeah , I 'd like the number for KKTV Channel 11 .
 Omar !
 What 's the cut- off for FedEx ?
 I need to get a package out Oh .
 Uh , yes , can you connect me to your ad sales department ?
 Thanks .
 Gums look good . No recession .
 Tongue looks good , too .
 Eyes are clear . This little lady 's in fine fettle .
 I could have one of the girls trim her nails , if you like .
 No .
 Some other time .
 What do you got for me ?
 Bodyguard job . 200 bucks .
 What else ?
 For you , that 's the best fit I 've got .
 I know a loan shark , always needs enforcement and recovery .
 Pays good and it 's steady work .
 Most of the time , we 're just talking intimidation . Strictly verbal .
 " Most of the time . "
 I 'm not breaking legs .
 What else ?
 Look , we discussed this .
 You want next- level pay , you gotta do next- level work . I respect where you 're coming from on this thing ,
 I do .
 But that 's just how it goes .
 All right .
 She 's gonna need a DHPP shot . In six months . We 'll send you a reminder card .
 Until then .
 Give me the bodyguard job .
 For 200 ?
 I 'll call you with the where and the when .
 So everybody knows to ...
 They know .
 Every line starting with 7700 has been re- routed to the bullpen .
 Plus your office . All the assistants know to keep them open .
 So if you 're on a call and another call comes in , the call doesn 't go to an answering machine , right ?
 Because , very important , old people don 't like talking to robots .
 If I 'm on a call and another call comes in , they 'll roll over to Maida .
 After that , Iris will get the next one , and then Julian , and then Barbara and Yvon .
 Yeah . Right on down the line . Good .
 Let 's make that the plan , then .
 Oh , so ...
 What time do you have ?
 Uh , quarter after .
 It should be running now , right ?
 Is there anything else ?
 No , thanks .
 It 's ...
 I 'll just be in my office .
 Come on .
 Come on .
 Come on , Colorado Springs ...
 Come on .
 Good afternoon , Davis & Main .
 Attorneys at law . How may we help you ?
 Yes , ma 'am .
 Yes , ma 'am , that is unfortunate .
 Now , to get your case started , may I ask for a name and a number for one of our attorneys to reach you ?
 Good afternoon , Davis & Main , attorneys at law .
 How may we help you ?
 Good afternoon , Davis & Main , attorneys at law .
 Yes , sir . That is correct . Good afternoon , Davis & Main .
 One of our attorneys ...
 Good afternoon , Davis & Main ... ... one of our attorneys get back to you .
 Give me one second ,
 - I 'm just going to take down ... - Yes . That is correct ...
 And you 're currently a resident at the Colorado Springs facility ?
 Good afternoon , Davis & Main ... Yes , ma 'am .
 We 'll be happy to send an information packet right out to you .
 May I ask , are you currently a resident of the Sandpiper Crossing facility ?



 Bingo .
 I 'll just need a name and a phone number .
 Yeah ?

 Yeah ?


 I asked , the guy wouldn 't tell me .
 But whatever it is , it 's serious money .
 And the guy , he specifically asked for you .
 And who 's the guy ?



 " We 're going down and fast . "
 Check this out , this is a good part .
 So do they all die ?
 Tell me that much . Shh , shh , shh , shh !
 Does Rock Hudson run ' em into an iceberg ?
 Is this before or after he did Shut up . Watch the movie .


 What is this weird fascination you have with stories of men trapped on the North Pole ?
 is on the North Pole .
 takes place on the South Pole .
 They literally could not be any more different .
 My Dad loves this one .
 Yeah , him and Howard Hughes . I know , right ?
 Can 't get two finer reviews than that .



 Mmm- mmm .
 It 's the boss .
 At this hour ? Yeah .
 Well , it 's never too late for congratulations .
 Cliff !
 Jesus , you 're still at the office ? Yeah .
 And , oh , my God , let me tell you , the response has been ...
 You ran a commercial without ever showing it to me ?
 Without first consulting me and my partners ?
 Did you actually think that was going to fly ?

 The day after it aired ! I only ran it once .
 Just in one small market .
 It was kind of an experiment , all right kind of under the radar .
 And in all fairness , you did tell me client outreach was my department .

 This commercial , I take it my firm 's name is mentioned ?
 Yes .
 Yeah . Jesus .
 Howard said you were a little eccentric .
 He didn 't tell me you were a goddamn arsonist !
 Cliff , to be fair , I don 't think ...
 Uh ...
 I apologize if there was any misreading of the situation on my part .
 But there 's a very positive headline here .
 We got 103 phone calls today .
 Off a measly $700 ad buy !
 Now , that kind of return on investment , you can 't ...
 Tomorrow morning .
 8 : 00 . My office , with the partners .
 And we want to see this thing .
 Cliff , when you see this , I know you 'll ...

 Yeah , Cliff .
 Thank you .
 Yeah , you too .
 Okay .
 See ya .

 Golden Boy .
 That 's me .
 So , what 'd I miss ?
 Anything blow up yet ?

 Feeling cautious ?
 You going to tell me what we 're doing here ?
 I 've got a problem .
 Okay .
 This problem ,
 I can 't solve it myself .
 This problem , is it a who or a what ?
 There 's a guy .
 I need him to go away .
