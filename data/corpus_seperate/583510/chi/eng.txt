 Joey cried Iast night .
 Thank you . We were playing poker .
 There was chocolate on the 3 .
 It Iooked Iike an 8 . God , you should 've seen him .
 " Read them and weep ! "
 And then he did .
 Now , how come you guys have never played poker with us ?
 What is that ? Some guy thing ? Like some kind of sexist guy thing ?
 Like it 's poker , so only guys can play ?
 Women are welcome to play .
 Then what is it ? Some kind of , Iike , some kind of , you know . . . . AII right , what is it ?
 There just aren 't any women in our game .
 We just don 't happen to know any women that know how to play poker .
 Please ! That is such a Iame excuse . It 's a typicaI guy response .
 Do you know how to play ? No .
 But you could teach us .
 No .
 Okay , so now we draw cards . I wouldn 't need any , because I have a straight .
 - Oh , good for you !
 - Congratulations ! Pheebs , how many do you want ?
 I just need two .
 The 1 0 of spades and the 6 of clubs . Pheebs , you can 't do that .
 I 've got the 1 0 of spades .
 Here . Thanks .
 See , you can 't do that .
 I don 't need them . I 'm going for 4s .
 Oh , you 're . . . .
 Here we go . We 've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites .
 What are you doing ? This is a poker game .
 You can 't serve food with more than one syIlable .
 It 's got to be Iike chips or dip or pretz -- At this point , the dealer --
 We got it .
 Let 's play for real . High stakes ! Big bucks !
 You sure ? Phoebe just threw away two jacks . . . . . . because they didn 't Iook happy . But I 'm ready .
 So just deal .
 Everybody , Iast minute Iesson !
 Joey . . . . Three . . . . . . eight ! Eight , three .
 AII right !
 Damn it , damn it , damn it ! I see .
 So then you were Iying . - About what ?
 - About how good your cards were . I was bluffing .

 And what is " bluffing " ?
 Is it not another word for Iying ?
 Sorry to break up this party . . . . . . but I 've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow .
 Rach , we 've got to settle .
 Settle what ?
 The Jamestown colony of Virginia .
 You see , King George is giving us the Iand , so . . . . The game , Rachel .
 You owe us money for the game .
 Oh , right !
 Guys , it 's their first time . Why don 't we forget about the money ?
 HeIl , no ! We 'II pay .
 Okay , Monica , I had another answer aII ready .
 And you know what ? - We want a rematch .
 - That 's fine with me . Could use the money .
 So you get your ya- yas by taking money from your friends .
 And I get my ya- yas from Ikea .
 You have to put them together yourself , but they cost Iess .
 Look , Rachel , this is poker . I play to win . In order for me to win , others have to Iose .
 If you 're gonna play poker with me , don 't expect me to be nice . Because once those cards are dealt . . . .

 I 'm not a nice guy .
 AII right , boys . Let 's eat .
 Did you get that from the " I Love Rachel " pizzeria ? Are you stiII on that ?
 Come on .
 What was with that Black Bart speech ? " When I play poker , I 'm not a nice guy " ! You 're way off , pal .
 I don 't think so .
 See , Ross , because I think you love her !
 I might have had feelings for her at one time . Not anymore . I just -- Marcel !
 Where are you going with that disk ?
 You are not putting that on again .
 If you press that button , you are in very , very big trouble .
 You believe what a jerk Ross was being ?
 Yeah , I know . He can get reaIly competitive .
 What ?
 " HeIlo , Kettle , this is Monica . You 're black ! "
 Please ! I am not as bad as Ross .
 I beg to differ .
 The Pictionary incident ?
 That was not an incident . I was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand . - I got an interview !

 - You 're kidding ! Where ?
 Saks Fifth Avenue !
 It 's Iike the mother ship is caIling you home .
 What 's the job ?
 Assistant buyer ! I would be shopping . . . . . . for a Iiving !
 That 's Aunt Iris .
 This woman 's been playing poker since she was 5 .
 You 've got to Iisten to every word she says .
 - Is Tony RandaII dead ?
 - I don 't think so .
 He may be now . I think I hit him with my car .
 - My God ! ReaIly ?
 - No , that 's bluffing ! Lesson one ! Let me teII you something .
 Everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap ! - Nice earrings .
 - Thank you . Girls , sit down !
 Aunt Iris , this is Phoebe , and that 's Rachel --
 Listen , I am parked at a meter . Let 's do it .
 Ross , could we please , please , Iisten to anything else ?
 AII right .
 I 'm gonna pay for that tonight .
 Guys , guess what , guess what ?
 The fifth dentist caved , and now they aII recommend Trident ?
 No , the interview ! She loved me .
 She absolutely loved me . We talked for two and a half hours .
 We have the same taste in clothes . And I went to camp with her cousin .
 And the job is perfect ! I can do this weIl !
 That 's great ! God !
 And she told the funniest story .
 Great , you 'II teII us and we 'II Iaugh ! Let 's play poker !
 Listen , we talked about it . . . . . . and if you don 't want to play , we completely understand .
 We can play some other game . Like . . . . . . Pictionary ? Very funny .
 We 'd give poker another try .
 ShaII we , Iadies ?
 Yes , I think we should .
 Rach , do you want me to shuffle those ?
 That 's okay , I 'm gonna give it a go .

 So Pheebs owes 7 . 50 . Monica , you owe $ 1 0 . 00 . And , Rachel , you owe 1 5 big ones !
 Thanks for teaching us " Crossed- eyed Mary . " We gotta play that other way .
 Here 's my 7 . 50 , but you should know that this money is cursed .
 - What ?
 - I cursed it !
 So now bad things wiII happen to he who spends it .
 I 'II take it . Bad things happen to me anyway . This way , I can break them up with a movie .
 So that just Ieaves the big Greene poker machine , who owes 1 5 .
 It 's so typical :
 " I 'm a man ! I have a penis ! I have to win money to exert my power over women ! "
 You know , this isn 't over . We wiII play you again .
 And we wiII win and you wiII Iose . And you wiII beg and we wiII Iaugh .
 And we wiII take every Iast dime you have . And you wiII hate yourselves forever !
 Kind of stepped on my point there , Monica !
 Wanna hand over your money now ?
 That way , we don 't have to go through the formality of playing .
 No , that 's fine . We 'II see who has the Iast Iaugh , monkey boy . Are we done with the chit chat ?
 Ready for serious poker ?
 You guys , Iook ! The one- eyed Jack foIlows me wherever I go . Right , okay .
 Serious poker .
 Excuse me . Where are you going ?
 To the bathroom .
 Do you wanna go to the bathroom or play poker ?
 I wanna go to the bathroom .
 WeIl , I 'm gonna order a pizza .
 I 'm waiting to hear from that job . The store closes at 9 . You can eat then .
 That 's fine . I 'II just have a Tic Tac to hold me over .
