 God , I love seeing you laugh .
 Oh , well , it 's been a long time Since I 've been in the mood to . Thank you .
 <I>Persistence paid off</ I> <I>for Susan 's new friend . </ I>
 You 're gonna leave me out here in the middle of nowhere ?
 <I>And Bree began to regret</ I> <I>what she had done . </ I>
 <I>Orson Hodge dreamed</ I> <I>of the perfect honeymoon . </ I>
 <I>Indeed , he 'd begun planning it</ I> <I>the moment Bree Van De Kamp</ I> <I>agreed to marry him . </ I>
 <I>They 'd start by flying</ I> <I>first class</ I> <I>to an exclusive 5- star hotel</ I> <I>where they 'd spend</ I> <I>their days by the pool</ I> <I>and their nights making love . </ I>

 <I>And when they returned home, </ I> <I>their perfect honeymoon</ I> <I>would continue ...
 Forever . </ I>
 Mrs. Hodge ?
 Yes , Mr. Hodge ?
 Do you have any idea how happy we 're going to be ?
 I don 't need to be any happier than I am already at this very second .
 Oh , my goodness , there 's only 15 minutes before our plane .
 If you want that latte , you should go now .
 Yeah , that 's a good idea . <I> ... short of heart- wrenching . </ I>
 <I>The population of homeless</ I> <I>teenagers continues to climb . </ I>
 <I>This is Andrew . </ I>
 <I>Andrew , what is it like</ I> <I>to live on the streets ? </ I>
 <I>It 's not so bad . </ I>
 <I>I mean , you know, </ I> <I>sometimes people give you food . </ I>
 <I>You can find a lot</ I> <I>in dumpsters . </ I>
 <I>Uh , I- I mean, </ I> <I>just last night, </ I>
 <I>I found almost a whole bucket of chicken</ I> <I>that had hardly been touched . </ I>
 <I>Andrew told me</ I> <I>his heart- wrenching story -- </ I> <I>an alcoholic mother, </ I> <I>a ther murdered by the woman 's boyfriend</ I> <I>and a childhood shattered</ I> <I>the day his mother abandoned him</ I> <I>on the side of the road . </ I>

 I 'll tell you one thing .
 Some people just should never be allowed to have children .
 Darling , I got an extra one just in case you ...
 Bree , what 's the matter ?
 A reporter just did a story on homeless teens , and my son was one of them .
 Oh , my god .
 Well , we 'll call child welfare the minute we get to the resort .
 Orson , you can 't imagine that we 're still going !
 Well , darling , the tickets are nonrefundable .
 My son is eating out of dumpsters !
 Well , yes , but think how much better you 'll be able to deal with this crisis after a nice , relaxing --
 Orson !
 My child is in trouble .
 Don 't make me choose between the two of you , because believe me , you will lose .
 Now please , get your ass in gear .
 <I>It was at this moment</ I> <I>that Orson realized</ I> <I>their honeymoon was over ... </ I> <I>in more ways than one . </ I>
 <I>It was a holiday weekend</ I> <I>on Wisteria Lane, </ I> <I>and everyone was packing</ I> <I>their bags, </ I> <I>hoping to get away</ I> <I>from it all . </ I>
 - No , no , all right , good- bye , good- bye ! - No , no !
 This is so ... unfair . no , no ! what 's unfair is that we 're slowly running out of money , and you 've barely even looked for a job . you 're gonna have a good time , all right ?
 I love you . Good- bye ! <I>Lynette was getting away</ I> <I>from growing tension in her marriage . </ I>
 You can call it blackmail , Carlos , but the court calls it " spousal support , " so unless I get a check by monday , your shower buddies from jail will be throwing you a " welcome back " party .
 <I>Gabrielle was getting away</ I> <I>from an increasingly bitter divorce . </ I>
 Hi .
 I 'm ready .
 So that 's my number , in case there 's any change in mike 's condition .
 I 'm going to the mountains with a friend .
 And , uh , just in case you were wondering , it 's strictly platonic .
 He wasn 't wondering .
 <I>Susan was getting away</ I> <I>from mounting guilt . </ I>
 So you can 't tell me anything about my son 's whereabouts ?
 <I>And then there was Bree, </ I> <I>who had just learned</ I> <I>there are some problems ... </ I>
 - Fine ! <I> - You can 't run away from . </ I>
 Some reporter .
 All she could tell me was what neighborhood they found him in .
 They don 't have any contact information , no phone number , no address .
 Well , dear , if he had an address , he wouldn 't be homeless .
 This really blows .
 I am this close to becoming homecoming queen , and now I 'm gonna be that creepy girl whose brother 's a pathetic street junkie .
 You know , you could ** a little compassion .
 Your brother is out there on the streets , struggling to survive .
 And whose fault is that ?
 Oh , she 's right . This is all my fault .
 You can 't blame yourself .
 No parent can stop a child who 's determined to run away .
 He didn 't run away .
 I kicked him out .
 You what ?
 I left him on the roadside with some money and his clothes .
 I didn 't tell you because I was afraid of what you 'd think of me .
 You did what you had to do .
 I just wish you 'd said something sooner .
 Don 't you know there 's nothing you can 't tell me ?
 I don 't want there to be any secrets between us .
 There won 't be , not anymore .
 You know , Andrew is not the only one having a rough year .
 I 'm the one whose boyfriend got shot right in front of her .
 We 'll talk in the car .
 Don 't you love this ?
 Oh , god bless Tom for taking the kids camping this weekend .
 This is exactly what we needed , especially after everything I 've been through lately .
 I 'm all about relaxing and rejuvenating --
 Gaby ? yeah ?
 Could you be all about shutting up ?
 - Oh , I 'm sorry . - Thanks .
 Please don 't tell me you brought your cell phone .
 Oh , I 'm sorry .
 It 's just -- I 'm waiting for Carlos ' lawyer to call .
 This whole spousal support thing 's gotten ugly .
 Hello ?
 Oh , hi , Tom !
 No ! No , no , no .
 No ! Yeah ! Yeah , she 's right here .
 Hang on .
 Did you say something ?
 Hey .
 Honey , I know it is your weekend away , but it 's my damn back .
 I threw it out again .
 So ? So I can -- I can barely sit up . The kids are running wild .
 I ... I need you to come up here .
 Well , why don 't you take a muscle relaxant ?
 Honey , I 've already taken two . They 're not making a dent .
 Well , why don 't you give them to the kids ?
 Ugh , Lynette !
 Please don 't -- <I>please</ I> don 't do this to me .
 Parker , for the last time , put down the damn ax !
 Oh , all right . Yeah , yeah .
 I will be there as soon as I can .
 God , I hate my life .
 I know .
 I wouldn 't trade with you for anything .
 Oh , wow , look at the view .
 Oh !
 Don 't you just love when the leaves change color ?
 Well , that 's why I suggested this , so -- so we could hang out for the weekend and ... and enjoy the , um ... *****
 Yep , the scenery 's great .
 So , um ... maybe I should unpack .
 Where should I do that ?
 Well , there are -- there are two bedrooms .
 One -- one is mine ... and there 's a guest room .
 Oh !
 A guest room . That -- well , that 's handy .
 Yeah .
 Uh , unless , of course , you -- you 'd like to sleep in my room .
 In which case , I would take the guest room .
 Oh ! I ... uh , no , no !
 I- I should take the guest room because I am the guest .
 Yeah , well , it 's , uh , it 's up the stairs at the end of the hall .
 Okay .
 Susan , I , um ...
 I think I have <I>your</ I> suitcase .
 Yeah , and I think I have yours .
 So , did you , um , did you happen to see the , um --
 Yeah .
 - And did you notice ... - Hard to miss .
 - Well , I 'm just going to , um ...
 - ... hide pathetically in your room ?
 Me , too .
 Hey , Lynette .
 What are you doing here ?
 Kayla called , and she told me about Tom 's back .
 And my car got impounded again , so I thought that I 'd hitch a ride with you .
 Hitch ?
 You mean , like , we 're gonna be driving in the car together ?
 Well , you could strap me to the front bumper , but , uh , yeah , I 'd be more comfortable inside .
 Uh , it 's like an 8- hour drive .
 So ?
 Um , how far is the impound lot ?
 Because , you know , I could just drive you over there and --
 What 's your problem , Lynette ?
 I don 't have a problem . I just don 't think we both need to go up there .
 I can grab Kayla and bring her back .
 Oh , I see your plan --
 You just wanna go charging up there on your white horse and save everyone , and then I get to be the rotten mother who didn 't give a rat 's ass and stayed home eating bonbons .
 No .
 <I> - Due to Lynette 's sudden departure ... </ I>
 - Thank you . <I>Gabrielle was forced</ I> <I>to spend the last night of her spa vacation alone, </ I> <I>but she didn 't mind . </ I>

 <I>In fact , she looked forward</ I> <I>to a quiet dinner alone with her thoughts . </ I>
 <I>unfortunately for Gabrielle, </ I> <I>her thoughts quickly turned</ I> <I>to her impending divorce</ I> <I>and the empty house</ I> <I>she 'd soon return to, </ I> <I>and she began to resent</ I> <I>the happy couples she was seeing ... </ I> <I>everywhere . </ I>


 What is this , freakin ' Noah 's Ark ? !
 I guess it really <I>is</ I> a small world .
 Who 's there ?
 I can 't see you .
 Can you see me now ?
 How much , baby ?
 Excuse me , Ma 'am ?
 I mean ...
 Miss , I 'm looking for someone .
 Uh , his name is Andrew .
 Have you seen him ? Hard to say , boo . I see a lot of lost boys his age .
 Good- looking one , though .
 Someone special ? Yes , very , and I 'm worried sick about im .
 You might try the soup kitchen at st . malachi 's on third .
 - Oh , thank you , miss ...
 - Gates .
 Pearly Gates -- ' Cause you can 't get to heaven without going through me .
 How very saucy .
 Great plano .
 Do you play ? Oh , no , I 'm a -- I 'm a bit rusty .
 Jane loved to sing , so I 'd play for her , but since the accident ...
 Right .
 So ...
 Brandy , a roaring fire -- what could be more romantic ?
 Well , I can think of -- of something .
 Wow , my heart is pounding .
 Uh , is that a bad thing ? Consider the alternative .
 Your heart is beating even faster than mine .
 I guess I 'm excited . It has been a while .
 Me , too .
 So was that , uh , okay ?
 It was bloody fantastic .
 Of course , it 's a bit different than what I 'm used to .
 Different ?
 Well , I- I was with the same woman for a long time .
 Oh , yeah .
 But , I mean , you kissed other girls before that , right ?
 Sure , but most of them were 12 .
 As was I.
 I met one at a school dance , and after we started dating , well , I -- well , I never looked at anyone else .
 Are you saying that Jane is the only woman you ever ...
 Oh , God , I <I>so</ I> didn 't want to tell you that .
 Why not ? I think that 's adorable .
 Well , I don 't want to be adorable . I want to be dashing and worldly and ...
 Oh , Ian . It 's okay .
 Some people have a lot of lovers , and some just a few .
 It doesn 't matter .
 Well , see -- seeing as it doesn 't matter , where -- where do you fall on that spectrum ?
 You know , how -- how many men have you been with ?
 - Ian . - Oh , I 'm sorry . That -- that was rude .
 I withdraw the question .
 It 's not that it 's rude .
 It 's just immaterial . I mean , it 's just a number . It doesn 't mean anything .
 - Seeing as it doesn 't mean anything -- - Ian !
 Well , you know my number .
 It 's only fair . Is it -- is it more than three ?
 Nine .
 Please tell me you were answering in german .
 Nine lovers is not a lot ! Nine lovers does not make me a slut !
 Why are you getting upset ?
 Because it was really 11 , and I knocked off two , and you 're still judging me .
 I 'm not judging you . It 's just ... did you work in the recording industry ?
 Okay , just so you know , 11 is not a lot for a woman my age .
 How old are you ?
 What is this , the Gallup poll ? !
 - Where -- where are you going ? - To bed , <I>alone . </ I>
 You know , it 's something that I 've always wanted to try , but I 've just never gotten around to .
 So they liked the landscaping I did here so much that they hired my company to do whole sinclair hotel chain .
 Your company ? You have a company now ?
 Oh , my gosh , when I met you , all you had was a bike .
 Well , not only that , the , uh , Gardening Channel 's approached me about hosting my own show .
 I mean , we 're still in the talking stages , but ...
 What ?
 Nothing .
 I just ... I can 't get over how mature and confident you are .
 You 've really changed .
 Thanks . I was hoping you 'd notice .
 So I guess , uh , there 's no chance of getting you over to the house to pick the dead leaves off my ficus .
 Yeah , you know , I 'm -- I 'm kind of past that .
 Besides , I don 't think Mr. Solis would approve .
 Actually , we 're getting a divorce .
 Um , I 'm -- I 'm really sorry to hear that .
 Really ? Then why are you smiling ?
 I don 't know .
 Why are you ?
 Gabrielle ...
 It 's really great to see you .
 Gabrielle .
 I think that 's the first time you 've ever called me that .
 Well , um ...
 I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay .
 I intend to .
 Your cuppy thing is full .
 Do you mind if I put this in your glove compartment ? Yeah , I do mind .
 I mind deeply . Jeez- a- marooni .
 I 'll just get rid of 'em .
 Oh , that 's ... delightful . That 's delightful .
 Maybe it 'll just soak up the cream soda you spilled .
 Why do you <I>always</ I> pick on me ?
 It 's like your new favorite game is " finding fault with Nora . "
 No , my favorite game is counting all the things I 'm <I>dying</ I> to say to you , but I don 't .
 Like ...
 " Pipe down , you annoying nut job . "
 I 'd never say that . You think I 'm crazy .
 No !
 You 're colorful -- colorful in a way that might respond to medication .
 Well , you know ... there 's levels of crazy , Lynette .
 I mean , there are people like me who just have a big personality .
 Then there are the kind of people who do things like this . - Aah !
 Oh , my God ! Knock it off ! - What is the matter with you ? !
 What is wrong with you ? What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Oh , lighten up .
 Come on , it was a joke . No , well , it wasn 't funny .
 If you wanna kill yourself , fine , - but don 't take me with you .
 - Ooh , you 'd like that , wouldn 't ya ?
 You 'd really like that , if I killed myself .
 That is not what I 'm saying .
 But if you did , I 'd find a way to carry on .
 Pull over . - Oh , lighten up .
 It 's a joke . - Pull the car over . - Nah .
 - Pull it over ! - Pull over , or I will jump out of this car .
 - All right , all right , all right , all right . I 'm pulling over !
 Jeez ! What the hell are you doing ? !
 Hitching my way ... to the campsite !
 Nora !
 You can 't be serious ! Shut up !
 Just get out of my face !
 I 'm not talking to you !
 All right , now look , you 've gone from crazy to stupid . This guy could be dangerous .
 Well , then , it 's your lucky day , huh , Lynette ?
 Shut up ! See ?
 This is what you do .
 You just manipulate .
 You wormed your way into my family .
 You conned your way into coming on this trip with me , and now you wanna force me into saving you .
 Well , forget it ! You wanna go , <I>go . </ I>
 No , I 've tried that . It wasn 't enough power .
 Yeah , I 'm way ahead of you . All right , here it goes .

 Ah , it worked ! I 'm a genius .
 Oh , hi .
 Um , I 'm looking for Edie . She 's out .
 - Ugh , God , where is everyone tonight ?
 - Anything I can do ?
 No , not unless you can fix a fuse box .
 My science fair project blew the power out .
 Oh , what 's your project ?
 Oh , uh , it 's complicated .
 You think I 'm too dumb to understand your little science project ? It 's not little .
 I finished third in the state twice .
 Now can you fix the fuse box or not ?
 Most houses built after 1990 are wired through a circuit breaker . You didn 't blow a fuse .
 You tripped a breaker .
 Not to challenge a 2- time state science fair almost- champion or anything .
 Let me grab a flashlight .
 Maybe you could also grab a shirt ... and some pants .
 Pants would be nice .
 Susan , can I come in ?
 I 'm with a client . Take a number .
 Susan , please .
 Everything I said came out of my -- my own insecurity and fear that I -- that I might ... well , I might disappoint you .
 I was gonna stay mad at you another hour , but your damn accent gets me every time .
 Blimey , you -- you don 't say ?
 Don 't push it .
 Oh , no , I- I don 't mean to break the flow , but I- I just , um ...
 Look , I know that I 'm only your second lover ever , and that -- I- I know that means a lot , and I just don 't want it to mean .. too much .
 I 'm not following you . What do you want it to mean ?
 I mean , the last time you did this , it turned into a lifetime commitment , and I -- I 'm just -- I 'm not ready for that .
 You think I am ?
 Well , I assure you , I 'm as capable of having meaningless sex as you are .
 I have never had meaningless sex .
 So you were -- you were passionately in love and deeply committed to all 11 of your conquests ?
 Don 't judge me , Mr. Virgin ... plus one !
 Okay , okay , we -- we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot again .
 Susan ...
 Cheerio ? Bob 's your uncle ?
 Get out .
 - Can 't we at least talk ? - Why ?
 You know , every time we do , we just get angry .
 Well , we 're still getting to know each other , and that 's good .
 You -- you 've learned I 'm a tad insecure ,
 And I 've learn -- well , you 're just a wee bit touchy . Okay , Ian , you know what ?
 This is -- this is not happening .
 I am just ** ing ep ** , and you can just drive me home in the morning .
 Uh , excuse me . I 'm looking for my son . Have you seen him ?
 Have you seen him ?
 Excuse me , young man . Have you seen this boy ?
 Andrew !
 Oh , my God , thank god ! What are you doing here ?
 Looking for you .
 How did you get that bruise ?
 - It 's none of your business . - Andrew , please !
 Shouldn 't you be at home , taking care of your new husband ? How did you find out that --
 I read it in the paper -- you know , the one I sleep under .
 Andrew , you have every right to be angry with me , but if you knew how sorry I am -- if you came here sucking after forgiveness , you came to the wrong place .
 Andrew , please , can 't we just talk about this ? I 'm your mother , for God 's sakes !
 You 're my son .
 No , <I>you</ I> dumped your son at a gas station seven months ago .
 I 'm somebody else now .
 Andrew .
 Andrew !
 Andrew , please !
 Andrew !
 What happened to your ride ?
 The guy grabbed my boob , so I hit him over the head with his bong , and I got out .
 Look , I 'm sorry I freaked out there before .
 It 's just , when you made that crack about suicide , it just ... kind of hit home .
 Oh , my god , Nora .
 Did you actually ...
 Well , I 'm ... I 'm very sorry . I had no idea .
 But your life is better now , right ?
 You have a beautiful daughter , and you have that fun job at the ... pancake house .
 Oh , yeah , my life 's better . Yeah .
 But it 's not <I>your</ I> life .
 Your life 's <I>perfect . </ I> Excuse me ?
 Did you smoke that bong before you beat the guy with it ?
 It 's just , you have it all . You have the kids . You have the career .
 You have a husband .
 You 're Supermom .
 And you think that 's easy ? Okay , I have a good life .
 Yes , yes , I am <I>very</ I> lucky , but I work 12 hours a day , and then I come home to what seems like 33 children and husban who resents to get a job .
 And believe me , there is not a Supermom out there who wouldn 't trade in her cape for a chance to read a book and get a massage by a man who has the decency to leave when it 's over .
 Okay , sorry I brought it up .
 I 'm sorry I said that about Tom . He 's doing his best to find a job .
 Well , you know , maybe he 'd try a little harder if he didn 't hate advertising so much .
 He doesn 't hate advertising .
 Last week , when he came to pick up Kayla , and he 'd just come from some crappy interview , he said that he 'd hated the ad game for , like , freakin ' ever and would like to bag the whole thing .
 He said that to you ?
 He 's never told me that .
 He 's probably afraid to .
 Why would he be afraid ?
 Probably because you 're the kind of woman who , when someone says they wanna kill themselves , you say , " go ahead . "
 - You sure you don 't want to come in ? - No , I 'm good .
 Uh , you really should see what I 'm doing , you know , for next time .
 Okay , here 's the tripped switch .
 So first , you move it to " off " ... to reset , then you press it ... to " on . "
 - That 's it ? - Yeah .
 You didn 't have to come all the way over here to do that .
 You could 've just explained it to me .
 Yeah , I guess I could 've .
 Well ... hello there . Edie !
 Hi . Oh , sorry .
 Uh , he was just -- he was helping me get the lights back on .
 I- I overloaded my circuits .
 I can see that .
 Yeah , so she 's doing some big science project , and she needed <I>me</ I> to explain how electricity works .
 I think that 's called " irony . "
 Julie , where 's your mom ? She 's on a trip .
 Do you need something ?
 Yeah , back when I could stand her , I loaned her my cd player . I need it .
 Oh , she took it to the hospital for mike .
 Oh , God .
 This Florence Nightingale act is really chapping my ass .
 Hey , science guy , I have an experiment for you .
 Go home , mix ounces of gin , a splash of vermouth , and see if it improves my mood when I drink it .
 Julie , sweetie ... you 're a good girl .
 Do yourself a favor and stay away from my nephew . Oh !
 Trust me , I have no interest in swaggering , muscle- bound juvenile delinquents .
 Honey ... that 's what every good girl says just before she becomes a bad girl .
 Trust me , I know .
 Except now when we 're done ,
 I don 't have to proofread your essay on " Ethan Frome . "
 And I don 't have to jump out of a window . That 's a nice change . - Yeah .
 Hey , how about I order up a bottle of Dom ?
 Ooh , I like Rich John !
 Hello ? Oh ! Uh , hi .
 Nothing , uh , you know , just , uh , room service and a movie .
 What ?
 Really ? You 're -- you 're kidding . Uh , no !
 I 'm -- I 'm thrilled .
 It 's , uh , room 424 .
 Me , too . Bye .
 - You gotta get out of here . - What ?
 My fiancée 's on her way up . Oh ! - Your fiancée ?
 - She was supposed to come tomorrow .
 Guess she decided to surprise me . Get dressed !
 Uh , you -- you 're <I>engaged ? </ I> To who ? ! Her name 's Tammy .
 Where 's your other shoe ? !
 How could you do this to me ?
 I would never have let you seduce me if I knew you were getting married .
 Well , you didn 't have any problem sleeping with me when <I>you</ I> were married !
 You knew about Carlos ! My cheating was upfront and honest .
 Look , Gaby , we don 't have time for this . Get moving .
 No , I 'm not going anywhere . In fact , I wanna meet the blushing bride .
 Listen to me , okay ?
 Her name is Tammy Sinclair , as in Sinclair Hotels , as in her father owns this whole damn chain .
 So if she catches you in here , I am totally screwed .
 Poodle !
 Look at you , surprising me . - Oh , I missed you .
 - I missed you , too .
 Ugh , this room blows .
 Daddy was supposed to hook us up with a suite .
 You know , you 're right .
 Why don 't we go down to the front desk and demand one ? - Come on .
 - Oh , no . They 're all booked .
 They call this a closet ?
 Where am I supposed to put all my stuff ?
 You know , I could really use a drink . Why don 't we go down to the bar ?
 I 'm wiped . I just wanna stay in .
 Didn 't you unpack yet ?
 No , um , actually , the -- the zipper is stuck , um , but they have a guy at the hotel that can fix it .
 You know I should -- I should probably go ahead and take it down to the lobby .
 Now ?
 I 'm horny .
 So am I ... but I will be a lot hornier ... once I get rid of this suitcase .
 Poodle ?
 Where did this diamond watch come from ?
 Oh , shoot , um ...
 That 's what you get for surprising me .
 I didn 't get a chance to wrap it .
 You like it ?
 I love it !
 - I 'm never taking it off ! - Son of a bitch !
 Come here , you !
 John ?
 John , where are you , damn it ?
 Don 't laugh . I saved a bundle on airfare .
 Susan , I 'm so --

 Your azaleas are breathtaking . Thank you .
 Ahem .
 You should be very proud of them .
 Yeah , it 's nice to know that I can raise some things correctly .
 Darlin ' , be patient .
 Andrew will come around .
 No , I don 't think he will .
 I failed him .
 I think you 're being too hard on yourself .
 And you 're not being hard enough .
 Stop saying that what I did was understandable .
 I 'm a mother who abandoned her child .
 That 's ... unnatural . Bree , it 's hot .
 You 're tired . Why don 't you come inside ?
 Because there is a bottle of Chardonnay in the refrigerator , and right now this little chore is the only thing that 's keeping me from going inside and drinking the whole damn thing .
 Well ... the azaleas really are lovely .
 Yes , they are , aren 't they ?
 Hi .
 Look , I 'm sorry .
 Here 's your watch .
 I guess I 'll just buy Tammy a new one .
 Don 't you mean her daddy will buy her a new one and just launder the money through you ?
 I don 't blame you for being angry .
 All right , I should 've told you the truth from the start .
 But when I saw you there in the moonlight , it took me right back to when we were together .
 Me , too .
 Do you wanna sit down ?
 You know , you 're pretty hard to stay mad at .
 Good ,
 ' cause I really didn 't want this to end badly .
 Who says it has to end ?
 What are you talking about ?
 Well , I 'm single now , and I thought we could maybe ... Gaby ...
 I 'm getting married .
 Sure , and I was married when we got together .
 Right , but <I>that</ I> is not how I 'm gonna be married .
 Well , that 's what I thought , but trust me , marriage is hard .
 I know that , but ...
 I love Tammy , and I don 't wanna screw it up .
 ' Cause enough of those screwups and ... you just end up alone .
 Yeah , that can happen .
 Good- bye , Gabrielle .
 Um , hey , mister , uh , could you spare a buck or 2 ?
 I 'm -- I 'm really hungry .
 Hey , thanks !
 I 'll give you $50 more , if you let me buy you lunch .
 Fries and a large root beer .
 What am I gonna have to do to earn this ?
 I told you , I just wanna talk to you .
 - You another reporter ? - No .
 You a youth pastor ? You trying to save my soul ?
 Oh , you make it sound like a challenge .
 No , I just wanna understand you , Andrew .
 Wait , how did you know my name ?
 You 're him , aren 't you ? You 're , uh ...
 The new husband .
 Orson .
 You know , I wouldn 't talk to her . What makes her think I 'll listen to you ?
 Your mother doesn 't know I 'm here .
 All right , <I>Dad . </ I>
 What do you wanna talk about , <I>Dad ? </ I>
 I wanna know how you survive out here . What do you do for money ?
 I ask . People give it to me .
 That 's it ?
 What -- what do you wanna know ?
 Have -- have I done stuff for money that I 'm not proud of ?
 Yeah , sure , but you figured that out as soon I asked you what the $50 was for .
 But , uh ...
 Don 't -- don 't tell my mom .
 Or -- or you know what ? Do . Who cares ?
 Well , I think part of you wants me to tell her because you know how much it would hurt her .
 I mean , that 's why you 're out here , isn 't it ? To punish her .
 When will you have punished her enough , Andrew ?
 When you turn to drugs to numb the pain , or you catch a disease you 'll never be rid of ?
 Don 't pretend to care about me , all right ?
 I do care about you , because Bree cares about you , because we 're more alike than you think .
 I know about rage .
 I know how it eats you up .
 But rage goes away , and when it does , you 're just left with the mess you 've made .
 Thanks for lunch .
 You change your mind , you know where to find us .
 How 's your back ?
 If I don 't breathe , great .
 God , it has been so long since my back has acted up .
 Then wham , out of the blue , I 'm crying by a tree stump .
 Well , you 're under a lot of stress .
 You got a new kid in the family . You 're job hunting .
 Ugh . Are we gonna fight about that again ? 'Cause if so ,
 I 'm gonna need those last four muscle relaxants .
 No , I don 't wanna fight .
 In fact , I was thinking ... if you can 't find something you like in advertising , maybe you should cast a wider net .
 Meaning what ?
 You 're a bright guy . Isn 't there anything else you might wanna do ?
 I 'd like to play bass for Aerosmith .
 Okay , let 's call that the backup plan .
 But , seriously , don 't you have some road not taken , some dream you never got around to ?
 I don 't know . Maybe .
 Maybe ?
 You have kids and ... you lose track of that stuff .
 I don 't know .
 You get married .
 Well , think about it , okay ?
 Cause whatever you wanna do , I 'm in your corner .
 Man , did I luck out marrying you .
 Tell me something I don 't know .
 Hi , Mike .
 It 's Edie .
 I 'm sorry that I haven 't come by to visit .
 Pretty rough luck , huh ?
 Anyway , I 'm , um ... here to pick up my cd player .
 So ...
 Well , I hope you feel better soon .
 Damn !
 And that 's <I>with</ I> the coma .
 <I>We all carry something with us . </ I>
 <I>Of course , it 's nice</ I> <I>if we travel with someone</ I> <I>who can help lighten the load . </ I>
 <I>But usually it 's easier</ I> <I>to just drop what we 've been carrying</ I> <I>so we can get home</ I> <I>that much sooner ... </ I>
 <I>assuming , of course, </ I> <I>there will be someone there</ I> <I>to greet us when we arrive . </ I>
 <I>Why do we clutch</ I> <I>at this baggage</ I> <I>even when we 're desperate</ I> <I>to move on ? </ I>
 <I>Because we all know</ I> <I>there 's a chance</ I> <I>we might let go too soon . </ I> sync : ytet- cflily ydy . com edit : ixquic
