 00 : 00 : 02, 950 -- > 00 : 00 : 06, 285 ( Max ) Ah , it 's like I 'm back in my mother 's womb . Only , there 's food here .
 ( Caroline ) Ugh , those e- cigs are so stupid .
 I mean , smoking real cigarettes kills you , but smoking fake ones makes me want to kill you .
 They 're not smoking .
 They 're vaping .
 ( Max ) Uh- oh .
 He just passed it to her .
 Someone 's getting date vaped .
 I just figured out the new phones .
 Now I 've got to figure out how to smoke ?
 If I wanted to learn everything all over again ,
 I would have had a stroke .
 ( Max ) Hey guys , sorry , but you 're not allowed to do that in here .
 And I 'm not talking about your outfits .
 I 'll get to those when I bring the check .
 Relax , it 's not a cigarette .
 It has a battery .
 Yeah , so does my vibrator , but ... can 't use that in here either .
 [ bell dinging ] I didn 't approve that rule .

 Well , I think we ordered too many of our cupcake tees .
 There are more unworn shirts here than in Matthew MacConaughey 's closet .
 Hey , girls . Look at me .
 I got my Sunday bra on ' cause I just came from church .
 Was it my church ?
 The Church of Latter- Day Sluts ?
 Oleg and I are looking for one to get married in .
 And it 's got to have a wheelchair ramp
 ' cause I 've got a lot of cousins who were born without leg bones .
 I 'm so excited for you , Sophie .
 You deserve all the happiness in the world .
 I mean , so do I , but that 's obviously not happening .
 Are you done with your pity- party ?
 ' Cause I got to speak to Max .
 Max , do you want to be my maid of honor ?
 I would rather be eaten alive by a rabbit .
 Which would take a long time and be a lot less embarrassing .
 And Sophie , you don 't really want me to be your maid of honor .
 That 's right .
 I don 't .
 So why are we even talking about it ?
 Sophie , as honored as I am that you asked , it 's just not really my thing , you know , man ?
 Is this really not your thing ?
 It 's nobody 's thing .
 You just do it 'cause you 're supposed to ,
 like bleaching your teeth or your anus .
 Thank God I 'm off the list ,
 ' cause that bridesmaid spa day is gonna be rough .
 Look , I 'm sorry , it 's just , I was a maid of honor in fifth grade when my mom married her cult leader .
 And then she was my maid of honor when I married him a week later .
 So I 'm kind of maid- of- honored out .
 Maybe I 'll get one of my old sorority sisters to be my bridesmaid .
 I 'm gonna go home and find out which one is still thin enough to fly commercial .
 All right , where are we gonna store all these shirts ?
 It 's already too crowded in here with all the cupcakes , shame , and failure .
 We 'll sell some of these at the cupcake window , 20 of these are already going to that fancy boutique in Manhattan , and the rest , maybe we 'll get lucky and find a gay little league team .

 Oh , I know !
 Let 's get drunk .
 That 's your solution to everything .
 Seriously .
 We need to just take some to that new bar where idiots pay $20 for a drink .
 Drunk and stupid , that 's our target audience .
 And also , the special skills I 've listed on my resume .
 So you 're saying we 're gonna stoop so low as to sell T- shirts out of a duffle bag in a bar ?
 Yeah , we 're there .
 How much do you think this pays ?
 ' Cause I can do that .
 Yes , you can .
 All you need is a stepladder and boobs .
 Feel like the
 bar .
 Keep your eyes peeled for Whoopi Goldberg in a crazy hat .
 I can 't believe I 'm selling T- shirts out of a duffle bag in the future , too .
 Yeah .
 I fully support mixing business and pleasure .
 Best sex I ever had was with my boss at a Panera Bread .
 I thought you said the best sex you ever had was with a dude with six fingers .
 Same guy .
 Man , could he make a sandwich crazy fast . Hi .
 Want to buy a cool tee for your girlfriend ?
 Let me see if my girlfriend wants a tee .
 You want a tee , honey ?
 ( Max ) Hey !
 Hey !
 Not so fast .
 They say " cream filled " on the back .
 Huh , boys ?
 Anything ?
 Wow , gays aren 't fun in the future .
 Hey .
 Jesus comes back in the future . So what 's in the bag ?

 I 've never met a girl at a bar with actual baggage .
 That 's funny because you mean like emotional .
 You 're really beautiful .
 Mmm .
 You weren 't nearly this hot in the book .
 So can I get you ladies a drink ?
 Sure , you could jut change this water into wine .
 Can you , like , do this for me , just , like , once ?
 Drinks on me .
 Oh , lucky them .
 I haven 't heard I 'm beautiful from a non- homeless person in months .
 Well , with that hair , the jury 's still out .
 Hey , can I kiss you ?
 I suppose a peck wouldn 't ...
 Say what ?
 - I 'm James . - I 'm wet .
 Because my arm was sitting in water on the bar .
 That was so hot , Max .
 I have , like , this animal attraction to him .
 What animal ?
 The Horny Nerd ?
 Look , I 'll leave .
 You stay and do your thing .
 - But we came together .
 - Yeah , I know you guys did .
 It happened , like , the second he kissed you .
 I don 't do this .
 I just met him .
 Look , Caroline .
 I haven 't read the Bible .
 But I know that when Jesus returns , you must follow him back to his apartment .
 Let go ...
 let God ... get to third base .
 Max , where 's Caroline ?
 I haven 't seen her all day .
 But I 'm guessing she 's in heaven .
 [ footsteps approaching ]
 I 'm here , I 'm here .
 Nope , she 's in hell .
 Walk of shame , party of one .
 Girl .
 Gir- irl !
 Tell me everything that happened .
 Leave out no details .
 It was insane .
 I mean , like , so hot .
 Like the Caribbean or our shower that one time .
 [ screaming ]
 What are you two celebrating ?
 I know it isn 't a job well done .
 We are celebrating the release of the new
 trailer online .
 Seriously ?
 [ giddy laughter ]
 Max , we did everything .
 We ...
 Oleg , can you give us some privacy ?
 What ?
 I can 't be in the ladies ' room .
 I can 't be in the kitchen .
 So did you ...
 No .
 Well , did you ...
 No !
 Well , did you at least ...
 Oh , God , no !
 Well , what did you do ?
 Water a plant together ?
 We had sex .
 Last night and today .
 That 's a big thing for me .
 And , yes , it was .
 Yes .
 That was obvious in the bar .
 Skinny jeans are just boner X- rays .
 Oh , no .
 Oh , no .
 What , rat in the slaw again ?
 My rings .
 I left them at his place .
 I have to get them back .
 They 're half my belongings .
 So just text him and say , " Yo , I left my rings , nice wiener " " 100 " emoji , send .
 Max , I can 't text a guy first .
 It 's bad enough I have a Groupon for intimacy oil .
 Look , worst- case scenario , the McRib is gone for good .
 Second worst- case scenario , we can always implement the two- week rule .
 The two- week rule ?
 Wait , isn 't that how long you have to eat Pad Thai before it becomes bad Thai ?
 No , you really have to read my book .
 It means if he doesn 't text for two weeks , you can break in and get your stuff .
 All that fancy school and you didn 't learn nothing .
 Two weeks and nothing .
 I really thought he 'd text .
 I also thought should have won the Oscar .
 Still got it .
 Come on .
 [ grunts ]
 Wait , before I lose the rest of my self- esteem ...
 Tell that to the wall you 're currently straddling .
 Let me just check my phone one more time to see if he ...
 Nope .
 Self- esteem gone .
 I 'm afraid to jump .
 Jump , whore , jump !
 I sound like my mom teaching me how to swim .
 [ grunting ]
 I did it .
 I did it .
 That was , like , two feet .
 I 've snorted lines longer .
 All right .
 Just another Tuesday .
 Going all in Jesus ' backyard . There .
 That 's his bedroom window .
 I know 'cause we had to close it , since I 'm kind of loud .
 Oh , what are you like during sex ?
 What do I do if he 's home ?
 Do you want me to kill him fast , or do you want him to suffer ?
 And by that , I mean , do you want me to hold him while you ask him why he didn 't call ?
 He 's not home .
 According to this Instagram , he 's at Chipotle talking to a guy with a parrot on his shoulder .
 He had no time to pop off a text to me .
 Oh , it 's stuck and I can 't fit my boobs through there .
 I can barely fit them through the Holland Tunnel .
 Fine .
 I 'm going in .
 Finally , having no boobs pays off .
 Lift my legs up .
 Okay , but your legs in the air kind of got you here to begin with .
 - Uh- oh .
 - What oh ?
 I don 't remember him having a floral duvet .
 Or a bedside toilet .
 [ barking ]
 [ growling ]
 Or a dog .
 Pull me out !
 Pull me out !
 You 've got to read my book .
 I have a whole chapter on pulling out .
 [ whimpering ]
 No , no , no , no , no !
 Oh , stop licking me .


 Someone 's coming .
 Someone 's coming or getting licked ?
 Maybe you are in the right apartment .
 [ screaming ]
 Get out of my house !
 Get out of my house !
 No , no .
 This is a big mistake .
 Ben , call the cops !
 We got another crack addict here !
 We don 't have crack here !
 We don 't have crack here !
 And tell your friends !
 [ police sirens blaring ]
 If these match the prints found at an Arby 's break- in in '07 , it 's purely coincidental .
 I can 't believe this is happening to me .
 My life is over .
 Look at the camera .
 I 'm so humiliated .
 And turn to the side .
 Ma 'am , this isn 't " Vogue :
 Behind Bars . "
 Sorry , Officer , she 's a virgin .
 Me , myself , spent some time in the juvie system up in Providence .
 You know a family court judge named Shelly ?
 No .
 Go .
 Oh !
 Officer , hold .
 Thanks , but stay away during the full- body cavity search .
 Proceed .
 You think ?
 So you girls broke into an old lady 's house , got halfway through the window , and stole absolutely nothing .
 Glad I am protecting the city from you .
 I mean , ISlS who , right ?
 All right .
 Let 's go .
 If he had just texted me , none of this would be happening .
 I wouldn 't be in prison , I 'd be home .
 My other prison .
 Uh , wait , if who had texted you ?
 Thanks for asking .
 This guy I slept with didn 't text me for two weeks after we had sex , and I left my rings at his place , so I ...
 You did the two- week rule ?
 Yeah .
 But she got the wrong apartment because , knowing her , her eyes were closed the whole time .
 Well , why didn 't you say so ?
 We got a two- week rule over here !
 Stay right over here .
 We 'll get you out soon .
 I left my billy club at the Captain 's house .
 He 's got three more days .
 See ?
 See ?
 It 's gonna be fine .
 We 'll just chill here for an hour .
 It 's like an edgier Lens Crafters .
 What am I gonna tell my father ?
 A prisoned prison call ?
 I can 't be here .
 I can 't be here !
 No ! No ! Come back !

 We were good !
 [ alarm buzzing loudly ]
 Dumb move .
 Dumber than me and the Captain .
 Let me guess , our glasses won 't be ready in an hour .
 I can 't believe you got us arrested in jail .
 Where are we going ?
 I mean , besides nowhere in life .
 You girls lost your get- out- of- jail- free card .
 You 're gonna have to get someone to bail you out .
 You 're going in the holding cell .
 Yo !
 Fresh meat !
 Sorry , I have a reputation to uphold .
 [ Caroline whimpers ]
 Max , I 'm scared .
 I got this .
 Yo !
 She 's already my bitch !
 So she can 't be anyone else 's .
 Sorry .
 Hold my belt .
 - What ?
 - Do it !
 ( Max ) 'Sup , 'sup ?
 Cool , cool .
 50 women , 1 toilet ?
 It 's like backstage at
 Max , I can 't handle this .
 I can 't handle this .
 I couldn 't even watch
 Relax .
 This is play- jail .
 It 's not like we 're doing real time .
 Just put on your game face .
 I don 't have a game face .
 Unless the game is " I Give Up , My Life Is Over , " then this will do .
 Well , do something , because that 's about to get wiped off your face by the bruiser covered in tattoos making her way to us right now .
 Hey !
 You guys signing up for the talent show ?
 Excuse me ?
 Yeah .
 Some of us have been in here for days , due to prison overcrowding .
 So the guards let us put on a show .
 As long as nobody dies .
 Wow , prison has changed .
 Maybe I have a Norman Rockwell idea of prison , but , uh , what happened to shanking a snitch in the food line ?
 Oh , a talent show , that 's not scary at all .
 You know , I won my yacht club talent show three years in a row , in the 10 to 13 division .
 That 's crazy !
 I 'm looking at 10 to 13 for grand theft auto .
 Where are my manners ?
 I 'm Tanaya .
 I 'm Max .
 This is Caroline .
 But you can call us by our gang names ,
 White Lightning and The Blade .
 Sophie , I need you to bail me and Caroline out jail .
 We got charged with breaking and entering , which is also what Caroline let a guy do to her , and that 's why we 're here .
 Oh , jeez , Max .
 I mean , that 's a tough call .
 I mean , I don 't know if I can .
 Yeah , it 's really not my thing .
 You know , man ?
 I get it .
 I deserved that .
 I said no to you , so you 're saying no to me .
 Like the old saying , " Tit for bigger tat . "
 Yeah .
 Hmm .
 All right , let 's see .
 Uh , I would bail my maid of honor out of jail .
 Fine .
 Fine .
 I 'll be your maid of honor .
 I 'll buy you penis straws , and those glasses where the nose is a penis .
 Yeah !
 And the penis- shaped pasta ?
 I 'll do it all .
 I can handle the slammer , but Caroline doesn 't stand a chance .
 I saw a woman looking at her
 like she was a cartoon pork chop .
 Okay .
 Well , I 'll see you soon .
 And watch your back .
 Oh , you know what ?
 It 's a ladies ' prison , so watch your front .
 Is this your card ?
 No .
 Yes !
 Yes , that 's my card .
 Amazing .
 Okay .
 What 'd I miss ?
 The magic show and the improv troupe .
 They asked the audience for a word .
 I said , " Help . "
 Sophie 's coming down with bail money , as soon as her turkey is out of the oven .
 So 4 , 4 1/ 2 hours , depending on the stuffing .
 Thank God .
 Wait .
 Bail for both of us , right ?
 That wasn 't her original offer .
 But after some negotiating , we got there .
 What did you have to do to ...
 Max , you didn 't agree to ...
 Yup .
 Picture me in something low- cut and peach .
 A slutty peach .
 You 'd do that for me ?
 I 'm touched and shocked .
 I thought you 'd have forgotten me , had sex with the door guard , and been halfway across the parking lot by now .
 Yeah , well , he wasn 't into me , so ...
 Walk of shame , party of two .
 Girls , I heard you got locked up .
 Yup .
 We have to do 30 hours of community service .
 And Caroline won six minutes of privacy on the toilet in the talent show .
 Well , not so private .
 I had to tinkle while a woman in work boots made heavy eye- contact .
 I went to prison once for being at the wrong place at the wrong time .
 Meaning , I was down south .
 Look who 's back from the big house .
 Every house is a big house for you , Han .
 Watch your step , ex- con , or I 'll get the to haul you back in for impersonating a waitress .
 I can 't believe I 'm saying this , but I missed this place .
 When I was up in the pen , doing time with my girl , Tanaya ...
 Well , orange you the new black ?
 So , did you two have fun in ladies ' prison ?
 And tell me , is it anything like the 17 XXX movies I have with that title ?
 Okay , so I lost two of my best rings .
 So I 'm out $11 .
 I realized I 'm tougher than I thought .
 I sang in prison .
 I had a one- night stand .
 I 'm practically Johnny Cash .
 Well , Johnny No Cash .
