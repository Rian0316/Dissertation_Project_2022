 It means a lot to her to feel included .
 ( Susan ) He sort of asked me out .
 It 's okay with you if I go out with him ? -
 Once that baby comes , I 'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone . -
 Will you marry me ?

 Does she know you killed your wife ? -
 Get away from him now while you can .

 Well , I think a 10- foot train is great , but a shorter one would be just as nice , and you wouldn 't have to worry about people tripping on it .
 Personally , I love smoked rabbit , but for a sure crowd- pleaser , you can 't beat chicken .
 Uh , sure , who doesn 't love a string quartet ?
 But if you got a band , maybe people could dance , as opposed to sway .

 So what do you think ?
 Well , um ...
 I 'm not sure that I 've ever seen this shade of green before .
 Yeah , don 't you think it 'll be gorgeous with my coloring ?
 Yes , it would look perfect .
 For someone with your coloring .
 I mean , I was lucky to find these -- not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks .
 Then why the rush ?
 Yeah , Bree , I 'd have thought of you as a person who wants time to plan .
 Well , Orson and I talked about it , and we just feel , at our age -- it 's silly to wait .
 And with your help , I 'm sure we can get it all done .
 - Well , we are happy ...
 Oh , uh , that reminds me .
 I have to get a copy of the seating chart for you .
 Gaby , you are in charge of the centerpieces .
 And don 't worry , Susan . I will think of a job for you .
 How about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist ? Here 's a job .
 Susan , we don 't know that !
 All we have is some crazy woman 's accusations .
 His wife vanished , and he didn 't even tell Bree .
 How much more proof do you need ?
 He says he 's innocent . She believes him .
 If we say we don 't , she 'll just end up hating us .
 Well , I 'm sorry .
 I cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life ! ( Bree ) ahem !
 And what mistake would that be ?
 Well ... um ... honestly ...
 These dresses are hideous .
 **


 ( Carlos ) you want what ? !
 You heard me .
 And I want the bedroom stereo .
 I want the marble console and that painting of St. Augustine .
 You don 't even know who he is .
 I know he matches the drapes . - People , can we focus here ?
 And I want my pearl necklace back .
 Don 't think I didn 't notice that you swiped it .
 - That was my Mamá 's
 I think it belongs in family .
 - There was a time I belonged in your family , and you got over that .
 Stop eating my fries ! - I 'm hungry .
 You know what the doctor said .
 You should see his cholesterol .
 This man bleeds baking grease .
 - Enough !
 You two are gonna have to find a way to deal with each other , because you are about to bring a child into this world .
 And divorced or not , once that child arrives , you will be bound together for as long as you live .
 Well , in that case ...
 Have some more fries .
 I 'll pick Kayla up on Sunday .
 Whenever .
 Just go .
 You and Turk have a great time .
 Oh , trust me , we will .
 The man is a jackhammer .
 - Ah .
 Bye , Tom . Bye .
 See you Sunday !
 Where is goin ' ?
 She and Turk are going down to the river for the weekend . That 's Turk ?
 That 's the new boyfriend ?
 Unh- unh , no .
 Hey , hey , hey , Tom , please .
 I don 't want my daughter hanging around with a guy like that .
 You haven 't even met him .
 He could be the sweetest man in the world . ( squeals ) Ha ha !
 Ooh .
 More importantly , ever since he entered the picture , squeaky Fromme is never around .
 It has been bliss .
 I haven 't made this face ... in a week .
 If you ruin this , so help me , I will hurt you .
 Just look at him . look at him , please .
 I swear , that is a child 's skull hanging from his rearview mirror .
 Doesn 't that concern you ?
 No , I 'm good .
 Could be a monkey .
 Uh , I think I will have the ...
 Mesclun salad .
 That 's it ? That 's all you 're having ?
 ( whispering ) well , all the food is very expensive .
 You don 't need to whisper .
 The waiter knows they 're robbing us blind .
 You can have whatever you want .
 In that case , I 'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles . Is that okay ?
 Yeah , that 's fine .
 I 'll just have Jane moved to the V. A. hospital . - Oh , my god .
 I 'm kidding .
 It 's fine .
 I 'll have what she 's having .
 Of course . Thank you .
 God , I love seeing you laugh .
 Oh , well , it 's been a long time since I 've been in the mood to .
 - Thank you .
 Oh , dear god !
 Did I squeeze too hard ?
 No , it 's my wife 's parents .
 Oh !
 Oh , wow !
 Oh , is this gonna be awkward ?
 No , no , no , not unless , of course , they see us .
 ( man ) Ian ? - Awkward .
 Jeff , Renee , what a delightful surprise .
 ( chuckles )
 It 's so good to see you , dear .
 Hello . I 'm Renee , and this my husband Jeff .
 Susan Mayer .
 Uh , doctor ...
 Dr. Susan Mayer -- she 's new To Jane 's neurology team .
 Oh !
 I just assumed you worked In Ian 's publishing house .
 Well , yes , and how -- how nice that would 've been , huh ?
 Um , but , no , no , I 'm a ... a brain specialist .
 Well , Dr. Mayer , maybe I can ask you , our daughter 's most recent E. E. G. showed brain spikes , but it didn 't change the score on the Glasgow scale .
 Why is that ?
 What an excellent question .
 And this is the , uh ... spinal cord . - Uh- huh .
 And it , of course , attaches to the brain .
 You don 't have to dumb it down for us , doctor .
 We 've been dealing with Jane 's condition for years . Oh , good .
 Um , well , then let 's -- let 's get technical .
 Uh , let 's give Dr. Mayer the night off .
 She was in surgery for ten hours today performing a craniotomy .
 That 's exactly the procedure Jane had .
 How 'd it go ?
 Uh , well , it just -- Wow !
 I hear my -- my phone vibrating .
 Um , hello , uh , Dr. Mayer . Yeah , what ?
 You say that his brain shut off ?
 Oh , well , I 'll be right there . Um , stat .
 I 'm sorry .
 ( chuckles nervously ) duty calls .

 Orson ?
 I moved the furniture back !
 Good lord , Bree , not again .

 Don 't you want our first dance to be perfect ?
 There 'll be 200 people staring at us .
 You know , Bree ... since that incident at our engagement party , there 's been a lot of dark talk about me .
 Well , I don 't pay attention to gossip .
 I 'm just saying I would understand if you had second thoughts about marrying a man who 's under a cloud .
 Well , no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman .
 Strangers may talk , but I know the truth .
 Really ?
 Men have lied to me before .
 Believe me , that 'll never happen again .
 So you trust me completely ?
 Clearly , I do .
 The body is unusually well- preserved because it was buried in clay .
 Do we have a cause of death ?
 Blunt force trauma to the head .
 I want you to pull all the missing persons reports , cross- check against her height , age and weight .
 I 'm also running a DNA panel since we won 't be able to use her dental records .
 Why not ?
 Whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth .
 Nora ?
 What are you doing back ?
 Are you okay ?
 Shut the door !
 Okay .
 I don 't want Kayla to find me like this . What 's wrong ?
 Turk and I had a fight .
 What ? No !
 No , no , no !
 What happened ?
 What happened is , Turk is an ass !
 On the way to the river , we stopped off at this bar .
 And we were playing pool , and I got a little bitchy with one of the waitresses .
 Who cares , right ? I mean , who cares ?
 It 's a bar , and we all do it , right ? - R- right .
 So he tells me to watch my mouth .
 And I 'm like , whoa !
 Get a load of Mr. Two Strikes trying to tell me how to act in public .
 And then he called me a whore . We 're done .
 Okay , whoa ! Whoa !
 Take a deep breath .
 You don 't break up with a guy because in a weak moment he calls you a whore .
 And then on the way out , he threatened to hit me . Okay , but he didn 't .
 He didn 't . And , you know , until --
 Oh , jeez , Lynette , whose side are you on ? !
 I 'm on the side of love .
 You guys seem like such a perfect couple .
 I know .
 I just -- I- I ...
 You know , you don 't wanna Throw that all away
 ' cause of a fight with no hitting . ( sniffles loudly )
 No . it 's over .

 I just got off the phone with Turk 's parole officer , and I was like , " guess who ain 't in Nevada no more ? " Click .
 ( sobbing )
 I think I 'm gonna have to stay here tonight .
 ( rattling in distance ) ( door opens in distance ) ( rustling in bushes ) ( loud rattling )
 ( grunting )
 Freeze !

 Austin ?
 Hey , aunt Edie .
 Anyway ...
 Mom just got back from her cruise to Jamaica with new boobs and a 24- year- old cabin boy .
 - Ooh .
 Needless to say , me and Mr. " can I get you some more hot towels ? " -- we didn 't exactly hit it off .
 So after I broke his nose , I , uh , figured it was a great time to come visit my favorite aunt .
 Your mom always did have lousy taste in men .
 So , uh , I figured I 'd crash here for the night . Then hitch down to Mexico -- hang out , party .
 Yeah , I 'm thinking , like , no way in hell .
 You 're gonna stay here with me until things blow over with your mom , okay ? Cool . Thanks .


 Oh , wait , you 're 18 , right ? Well , that 's what my ID says .
 Yeah , mine , too .

 Hey , you are supposed to be on bed rest ! I 'm bored . - Well , why don 't you try putting on a pair of pants ?
 That should kill a couple of hours . ( doorbell rings )
 Hey , babe .
 Hey , what is she doing out of bed ?
 That can 't be good for her . Or the stairs .
 What do you want ?
 The mediator was right .
 A month from now we 're not just gonna be Carlos and Gaby .
 We 're gonna be Mom and Dad , and I don 't wanna be at war with the mother of my child , so , here .
 Your mamá 's pearls ?
 Carlos ...

 thank you . And ?
 And what ?
 Wouldn 't you like to make some reciprocal gesture ?
 Fine .
 You can come to Bree 's wedding reception as my guest .
 Thanks .
 Where is it ? Here .
 Here ? You 're throwing the ... reception ?
 Yeah , it 's our wedding present to Bree .
 So I give you a priceless family heirloom , and in return , you invite me to a party at my house that I 'm paying for ?
 Well , what kind of gesture did you have in mind ? ( scoffs )
 Mmm .
 Things I 'll do for jewelry .
 Susan , I am sorry . Mayer ?
 Panic .
 Pure panic .
 Here .
 These are for ruining our first date .
 Shh ! Not in front of Mike !
 Oh , look , Mike , Ian brought you flowers .
 I 'll just go put them in some water .
 Look , I- I was just trying to protect Jane 's parents . Oh , please .
 - They still haven 't accepted the fact that -- that Jane isn 't going to wake up .
 If they knew that we were on a date , that I was trying to move on , well , it would devastate them . That 's a really lovely excuse , but it isn 't the whole story , is it ?
 - Excuse me ?
 A part of you feels that you 're cheating on her .
 - No !
 Well , perhaps a small part , but that -- that doesn 't mean -- it 's all right , ' cause I feel guilty , too .
 That -- that 's why we should just stop is right now , because it 's all way too complicated , and I- I think we 'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends .
 Well , I- I don 't think I can do that . the -- the truth is ,
 I haven 't thought of you as just a friend for some time now .
 Maybe I shouldn 't have let myself feel that way , but -- but I have . And I can 't go back .
 I 'm sorry .
 Well , if we can 't be friends ... then I guess we 'll be nothing .




 ( decreases volume )
 Hey , leave that alone .
 Sorry , I was just ... turning it down .
 What , you 're not a music fan ?
 Sure , it 's just , um ...
 Got anything where a pimp isn 't beating his ho ?
 ( chuckles )
 I 'm Austin , Edie Britt 's nephew . Oh . ( chuckles )
 I 'm Julie , Susan Mayer 's daughter .
 Anyway , um , I was trying to do my homework , so ... On a Saturday ?
 Well , make sure and take regular breaks and stop for a sensible dinner .
 Just keep it down .
 You had it really loud .
 That 's how I like it .
 How do you like it ?
 You know what ?
 You 're not that hot .
 Hey , whatcha doing ?
 Oh , I 'm working on a seating chart -- mwah !
 For Bree 's wedding .
 Nora ? Who invited her ?
 We need to find her another boyfriend , and weddings are crawling with single men . I did .

 Hey , I hope you 're not seating her next to any of friends .
 - Hey , sacrifices must be made , Tom .
 No , Jerry Rawlings ! Not Jerry Rawlings !
 - She gets her psycho hooks into Jerry Rawlings , he will never speak to me again . Yes !

 Oh , there are other urologists in the world .
 Go back to that other guy .
 - The one with the cold hands ?
 Oh , it 's once a year .
 Suck it up . - Get a grip , Lynette .
 " Get a grip " ? !
 I am hanging on for dear life here .
 are the one that brought little problem into our family ,
 And the only thing I should be hearing from you is , " How can I help ? "
 I am also putting Steve Hanson at her table , so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy .
 Get a grip .
 ( cans rattling )
 ( chuckles )
 Hi .
 My name is Susan Mayer .
 Your neighbor told me I could find you here .
 Yeah ?
 - Well , I was at my friend Bree 's engagement party the other night -- you know , when you came in and you did that whole
 " Orson killed his wife " thing ? I was just wondering if you could elaborate .
 He killed her .
 What else do you need to know ?
 Well , what makes you so sure ?
 Do you have any proof ? Look , I can 't talk now .
 I get off at 6 : 00 .
 My friend is marrying that man in two hours . Please ?
 Okay , I- I need , um , $10 in unrolled pennies , and I need to see you count it ,
 ' cause last time you stiffed me .

 After Alma disappeared , the police came and searched the house . The police ? What did they find ?

 Nothing . And that 's bad why ?
 Don 't you get it ? When the police showed up ,
 Orson had scrubbed every inch of the place clean with bleach .
 No fingerprints , no skin cells , no DNA . It was like Alma had never existed .
 Who cleans a house like that unless he has something to hide ?

 So when I left the bank ,
 I called the detective that worked the case , and he said that the only reason Orson was never charged , was because they never found the body .
 - So he was an actual suspect ?
 He was the suspect . - Oh , my God !
 What are we gonna do ? Well , you know what we have to do .
 That was close .
 The florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet , but not to worry .
 Crisis averted .
 Bree ... we have to talk .

 Ah , Reverend .
 Any word from the bridal party ? They 're still in the bride 's room .
 You know women .
 They 're probably in there fussing about mascara and blush .
 He did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid !
 I said it was a theory . The point is ,
 Alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances .
 I don 't have time for this . I 'm getting married now . This is your day .
 You can push the ceremony back an hour .
 Now get that detective on the phone , talk things out with Orson .
 I can 't talk to Orson .
 It 's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding .
 You know what 's really bad luck ? Marrying a wife- killer .
 If the three of you don 't drop this right now ,
 I will never forgive you .
 Bree , we are just doing this because we love you .
 But ... if you can honestly tell us that you don 't have the slightest doubt ...
 None whatsoever .

 Hmm .
 ( Mendelssohn 's " wedding march " playing )
 Dearly beloved , we are gathered here together in the sight of god to join this man and woman in holy -- - Excuse me ?
 Could you give us just a second ?
 Is something wrong ?
 - I just need a moment .
 ( guests murmuring )
 Before we do this ,
 There 's something I need to ask you . - What ? Did you kill your wife ?

 Susan talked to that Carolyn woman .
 Why didn 't you tell me that the police searched her house ?
 Because it 's embarrassing , and they didn 't find anything .
 Is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly ?
 When I 'm upset , I clean .

 For God 's sake , Bree ,
 I swear to you I did not kill my wife .

 Okay .

 Proceed .
 Dearly beloved , we are gathered here together in the sight of God to join this man and woman in holy matrimony , which is an honorable estate ...


 Hey !
 Look at you , miss popular ! so are you having a good time over there ?
 and I don 't know what idiot stuck me at that table , but every guy over there is just a boring stiff .
 All of them ? What about ... Jerry ?
 Jerry 's fun .
 You mean Mr. Fatty Hair Plugs ?
 Oh , yeah , he 's a blast .
 ( imitates gunshot ) Um , how about Steve ? You know what ?
 I hear his family has money .
 Well , then maybe they could all chip in and buy him some deodorant .
 I 'm through with those losers . I 'm gonna stay right here with you .
 Are you gonna eat that ?

 ( gasps ) Hey , look at you !
 ( sighs ) God , I hate wearing a tux .
 On my way in , Bree 's aunt fern asked me to park the car .
 She 's got glaucoma . To her , you 're nothing but a Hispanic blur . ( chuckles )
 Let me fix your tie .
 Hey , you 're wearing mamá 's pearls .
 Yeah .


 Oh !
 Hey , Julie !
 Have you met my nephew Austin ?
 Yeah , we 've met .
 I just didn 't recognize him with his shirt on .


 She couldn 't take her eyes off my abs .
 I felt violated .


 Hi , Edie .
 Nice party , huh ?
 It was .

 Perfect .
 Well , it 's nice to see you two getting along again .
 We 've sort of turned a corner . - Really ? Does that mean you 're gonna be getting back together ?
 Maybe . - God , no !

 Wow , is that shrimp ?
 What would make you think I would even consider taking you back ?
 Well , you invited me to be your date . " Guest , " Carlos . I said " guest . "
 - Come on , you 've been flirting with me since I came in --
 " Here , baby , let me fix your tie . " I mean , for a woman who 's not interested , you sure are sending some mixed signals .
 You want a clear signal ?
 How 's this ?
 ( band playing jazz music )
 Ian !
 - Susan !
 What are you doing here ?
 Well , my -- my cousin is -- is Dr. Hodges ' dental hygienist , and her husband -- he -- he couldn 't join us since he 'd come down with a spot of impetigo , so she called me , knowing how much I love a good garter toss , and so --

 Ian .

 Yes , I- I 'm such a terrible liar .
 I mean , impetigo -- where did that come from ? Hmm .
 So what are you really doing here ? ( sighs ) Look ...
 I can 't stop thinking about us , about how great we could be together , and I think you 're making a mistake .
 Ian -- Susan , please don 't go .
 Can 't we at least talk about this ?
 I can 't , 'cause I have ... bridesmaid stuff .
 Hi there .
 I just wanted to say you 're doing a great job ...
 Tad . ( chuckles )
 That 's , um , that 's such a masculine name .
 My boyfriend seems to like it .
 Okay , here 's the drill . My ex is here , and I wanna piss him off , so just act like you 're all hot for me , and there 's a 100 buck tip in it for you .

 - Right .
 Uh , so should I ... cup your boob ?
 - No , I 'll drive .
 ( laughing loudly )
 Oh !
 Tequila , straight .
 Hey , are there any decent single women at this wedding ?
 Not that I 've seen . Ah , damn it .
 Not a one .
 Hey , Carlos .
 You should come over to our table .
 That 's where all the hotties are .
 Hey , everyone !
 I 'd say it is time that we get Bree and Orson up here for their first dance as a married couple .
 Ladies and Gentlemen ,
 I give you Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge !

 Orson , you look so serious .
 I 'm trying to remember my steps .

 You 're upset , aren 't you ?
 You 're still thinking about what I said at the church .
 Which part , darling -- the " I do " part , or the " Did you kill your wife ? " part ?


 I 'm sorry , but I had to ask .
 That 's my point . You had to ask .

 ( up- tempo jazz music playing ) ( squealing )
 You are gonna rot in hell for this .
 Hey , I just brought two lost souls together .
 Okay , how about this ?
 He cheated on my friend . he deserves every bit of ( singsong voice ) " crazy " she 's gonna rain down on him .

 Hell ... rot ... you .
 ( slow jazz music playing )
 What are they doing ?
 Rounding second and heading for third .
 Uh- oh . Carlos !
 Oh , hey , Gaby .
 Look , I made a new friend .
 Yes , I 've been watching you make your new friend , and it 's disgusting !
 - Do you mind ? We 're trying to dance here .
 Who the hell are you , anyway , and why the hell are you at this wedding ? !
 This is not gonna end well .
 They 're just two random people who met at a wedding . Can 't pin it on me .
 It was
 Lynette Scavo , I wanna talk to you !

 I 'll see you at home . What are you thinking ?
 I didn 't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends .
 Oh , no , you just wanted me to watch while you sucked the zits off some teenage waiter !
 That 's it .
 I take my invitation back . You are no longer welcome in my house .
 Fine , I 'll go !
 Just give me back the pearls . No !
 - Gaby . Carlos , no ! - They were my mamá" s !
 No ! ( gasps )
 Now look what you 've done !
 Mrs. Solis ! No , Carlos !
 - Hey , give me that !
 Give me those ! - Pardon me .
 Excuse me . Get away ! Those are mine !
 No , the hell they are ! Mrs. Solis ?
 Not now , Xiao- mei ! Mrs. Solis !
 Oh , for Goddess ' sakes , what ? !

 ( liquid splashes ) ( guests gasp ) ( woman ) Are you kidding ?
 I think maybe it 's time . And I wish you both a lifetime of happiness .
 ( rim shot , applause ) Wow .
 That was beautiful , aunt fern .
 Thank you .
 Hey , they mopped up all the amniotic fluid ,
 So we should feel safe ... Start the conga line !
 ( piano starts playing ) Actually , I 'd -- I 'd like to say a few words .
 ( piano stops playing )
 Bree , Orson , your love is an inspiration to us all .
 That 's very sweet . - Hmm .
 How do you know him ? I thought he was on your side .
 - Mnh- mnh .
 Well , I know this is a second wedding for both of you , and I think you 're jolly brave .
 So often , people find excuses not to fall in love again .
 They 're -- they 're afraid .
 But it 's rare to find somebody that you connect with , so when you do , you have to follow your heart .
 Bree , Orson ,
 I salute you .
 all right , let 's get the music cranking and the --
 Wait , actually , Tom , could you just hang on a second ?
 Uh , I- I also would like to say a few words .
 To Bree and Orson , uh , yes , what could be better than a second love ?
 And this time you enter into it a little older , little wiser , but also -- and this is key -- uh ... with a bit of caution .

 Because ... while love can be spontaneous and wonderful , it can also be selfish .
 And sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away .

 uh ...
 I -- Not you two .
 I mean , you two crazy kids are great . ( laughs )
 Congrats , yeah .
 Well , then , let 's -- Hang on .
 I 'd like to respond to that toast .
 Bree , Orson , sometimes walking away seem the best choice .
 It 's -- it 's certainly the safest .
 But ... but what do you do when you find someone who makes you feel joy when you thought you never would again ?
 Do you -- do you just let them go ?
 No .
 No , I can 't do that .

 ( microphone feedback squeaks ) You -- you wanna ...
 No .
 I 'm good .
 All right then , let 's dance ! **
 Well , I thought you might need a change of clothes .
 You 're still mad at me , huh ?
 What were you thinking , setting Carlos up with Skank ? !
 I 'm sorry . I was desperate .
 I had a little too much to drink .
 And you divorcing Carlos ...
 No , Lynette , Carlos will never be fair game .
 You know the rules . You 're right .
 You are right .
 You 're right . I 'm so sorry .
 It 's just ... what ?
 I 'm so unhappy .
 Ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives ,
 I- I can 't even work up a smile .
 And the more she pushes , the more I resent Tom --
 Tom , for something he did 12 years ago .
 And I 'm afraid if I can 't fix ... this , that ... the anger is just gonna fester until ...
 Lynette , listen to me --
 You and Tom will survive this .
 No , seriously , Gaby ,
 I am tired of pretending to smile .
 You and Tom ... will survive this .
 Yeah ? How can you be so sure ?
 Because some marriages were built to last ... and some aren 't .

 Trust me , I know the difference .

 ( applause ) ( both chuckle )
 I 'm looking for Bree van de Kamp .
 Right over there .
 Could you excuse me for just a minute ?
 Mm- hmm .
 Orson , congratulations .
 Excuse me .
 Are you Mrs. van de Kamp ? It 's Hodge now .
 Yes , I 'm terribly sorry to barge in like this , but we need your husband to come down to the morgue .
 We may have found his wife 's body .

 ( grunting )
 Push , Xiao- mei .
 Push .
 ( groaning )
 Okay , okay .
 Deep breaths now .
 You 're getting close . It 's time !
 I can 't believe this is happening !
 I think I 'm gonna cry .
 Carlos , I am so sorry about the --
 Yeah , I -- me , too . Me , too . I was way out of line .
 I forgive you .
 It 's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this .
 ( grunting ) Okay , I can see the head now .
 Oh , get the camera ! Get the camera !
 ( grunting )
 Oh !
 ( Gaby ) Oh , my God !
 ( baby crying )
 Oh , man ,
 I gotta get the color fixed on this thing .

 How could this have happened ? What kind of half- ass fertility clinic are you running ?
 Uh , prior to implantation , our embryo was accidentally switched with another client 's .
 So if we got theirs and they got ours , then -- then it 's possible ...
 No , I 'm afraid your embryo didn 't take .
 Again , on behalf of the clinic , I am so sorry .
 It 's rare , but these things do happen .
 - Excuse me . You screw up our lives , and the best you can do is ,
 " That 's the way the cookie crumbles " ? !
 And who is this guy ? Why is he writing down everything I say ?
 - This is Mr. Darby , our attorney .
 We thought it wise to have him present .
 Do you know what else would 've been wise ?
 Sticking the right baby in the right belly !
 Mrs. Solis , please .

 That 's not Alma .

 Are you sure ?
 Absolutely .
 Thank God .

 Carolyn .
 What is she doing here ? You didn 't honestly think they 'd take your word for it , did you ?

 It 's not her .

 Well , that 's it then .
 Sorry for wasting your time . This means nothing .
 I 'm telling you , that man is as guilty as sin !
 We know what you think .
 Now would you please leave us alone ?
 He 's a cold- blooded killer .
 He 's kind and decent , and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again .
 Now please go .

 You deserve him .

 Darling , I am so sorry you had to endure that .
 Are you all right ? I 'm fine .
 Let 's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened .
 - All right .
 Monique .

 Well ... Yeah .
