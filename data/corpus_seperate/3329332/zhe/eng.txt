 00 : 00 : 00, 000 -- > 00 : 00 : 01, 915 Previously on " The Originals " ... some sort of community , then what 's the point ?
 Kill each other and get it all over with .
 I 'm invested in protecting the people of this city , and to do that , I need the key .
 I had Josh lift it for me .
 Off my uncle .
 My brother taught me this code 15 years ago .
 You 're Klaus ' father ?
 - I need you . - What can I do ?
 You can bring me back to life . werewolves from the curse .
 What do I have to do ?
 I need to know what stone it housed .
 A ring of empowerment , something to control this curse .
 What kind of spell ?
 A spell of my mother 's .
 All I ask is that the child is kept safe .
 Our daughter should be raised by her parents in our family home . us to kill Klaus ' child .
 Whatever it is you got coming with the wolves , just know that I 'm gonna fight for my guys ,
 I 'm gonna fight for my city , and I will fight until I am dead .
 I would expect nothing less .

 for a bag of rocks .
 We 'll be in the quarter by dawn . Sure the hybrid will do his part ?
 Hayley will make sure of that .
 Yeah .
 I forgot your fianc√©e has got him wrapped around her finger .
 You know , Ollie , I love you like a brother , but if you don 't lay off Hayley , we 're gonna have a problem .
 Pay attention , Romeo .

 All right .
 Relax .
 We ain 't done anything .

 Evening , officers .
 Step out of the car , both of you .
 What 's this about ? do what the man says ...
 Before things take a nasty turn .

 Have I told you that you 're awesome ?
 Because you are , along with the sun , daylight rings ...
 That guy jogging in the tank top .
 Josh , now that you have a ring ,
 I think you need to leave town .
 Whoa , wait .
 We 're breaking up ?
 I 'm serious .
 Yeah . I know .
 Serious is kind of your default setting , which is why you need me around to lighten you up .
 Ergo , not leaving .

 Hey ...
 You ok ?
 Just witch stuff .
 Marcel came to me yesterday .
 He wanted a cloaking spell .
 He 's gonna make a move against Klaus , a big move .
 Wow .
 Ok .
 Guess he forgot to call me .
 Rude .
 Well , did you help him ?
 Yes , because I don 't want him to get killed , but if Klaus finds out ...
 Hey , look .
 If Marcel has got a plan , maybe Klaus will buy a clue , realize he 's a negative on the popularity chart , and go into vampire retirement .
 I hear Palm Springs is nice .

 Klaus isn 't the only thing we need to be afraid of . Look .
 If there 's a war coming , promise me you 'll go before you get caught up in it .

 Your mother 's spell is as complicated as it is elegant . She was clearly a very gifted witch .
 Is this the bit here ?
 Hey , like I said , it 's complicated .
 She bound protection magic to black kyanite stones .
 A werewolf with the stones is free from turning on a full moon . And what of the improvements ?
 This spell will enhance speed , strength , and agility .
 There should be something in there about fangs .
 It 's what my mother used on us when she turned us into vampires .
 Not just fangs .
 You said you want venom so the bite is still lethal to vampires .
 Hmm .
 Here .
 Should make a nice gift .
 I 'm sure Hayley will be thrilled .
 Oh , not just Hayley .
 You 'll be making quite a few of these .
 Let 's call it an even hundred .
 That 's not the deal I made with Elijah . Well , you 're dealing with me now ...
 And I am offering considerably more .
 You think because I sleep with you , I 'm suddenly at your beck and call . Because you sleep with me , luv ,
 I will protect you from those who might do you harm , including my brother .
 Because I need you , however ,
 I 'm prepared to offer something more valuable than my protection .
 Which is what ?
 My mother 's grimoire , from which I took these spells .
 You see , Elijah is offering you a mere peek at its pages , but I will grant it to you as a gift if you pledge your loyalty to me , beginning with the creation of those rings .
 This has been your plan all along .
 You want to build a werewolf army , and you 're using me to do it .
 Sweetheart , I 'm not the enemy . Nor are the wolves .
 Your abusive coven expects you to sacrifice yourself for the last of the harvest girls .

 Do this one favor for me , and you need never fear anyone ever again .

 Folks , you need to leave now .
 Hey , what are you ... to be nice about this .
 Hey ...
 Who the hell do you think you are ?
 I am the new owner of this gumbo shack .
 Ink is not dry on the contract yet , but I can tell you , I got it cheap .
 Business is not what is used to be since Sophie Deveraux kicked the bucket .

 Look .
 I don 't want any trouble .
 I don 't really care what you want .
 Let 's talk about what I want .
 Right . My uncle 's key .
 You said you were gonna use it to protect the innocents of the city .

 Seems pretty ironic , given your line of work .
 I 'm a legitimate businesswoman who 's never been convicted of a crime , and , as leader of the human faction , that key is mine .
 I gave you time to mourn .
 Now time is up .
 Message received .
 Let me just go find that key I don 't have .
 My family has been in New Orleans for a long time , Cami , even longer than yours , and we 've learned it 's a very hard city to get by in if you don 't have any friends .

 I 'd like to be your friend .
 So I 'm gonna give you until tomorrow , and after that , I won 't be so friendly .
 Uh !
 Uh !
 Uh !
 Uh !
 Leave him alone !
 We 'll leave your boy alone when you tell us what Klaus is up to . How the hell should I know what he is up to ?
 See , I know you 've been meeting him .
 The stones in your duffel bag , it 's black kyanite .
 It 's pretty rare .
 I also know enough about witchcraft to recognize the ingredients of a spell .
 So you gonna make me ask again ?
 Ok .

 with having two werewolf hostages ?
 You really only need one . think you 're a bunch of badasses , but back in '25 , I wiped out a whole bloodline of Guerrera werewolves .
 They were a lot tougher than you .

 You let him go , I will tell you about the stones , about Klaus ...
 Whatever .
 Gah !
 All right .
 All right .
 A deal is a deal , but since nirvana here is gonna turn into a wolf in about 8 hours , D. , drop his ass off way out in the bayou .

 Will I at least get to kill this fool ?
 No .
 I got a better idea .

 Yes , brother ?
 What is it ?
 It appears our wolves have gone astray , brother .
 They should 've been back hours ago .
 We need to find them . Well , that might be a bit tricky .
 You see , we 've located their car on a back road in the middle of nowhere .
 I suspect they 've been shanghaied .
 And you didn 't feel the need to share this information ?
 It was my intention to present you with the problem only after I 'd found an appropriate solution .
 Well , do enlighten us .
 I 'm closing in on it as we speak .
 The only person who would be bold enough to snatch my wolf allies is the one who has the most to lose .
 Marcel .
 No .
 He 'll kill them . that Marcel has procured a cloaking spell .
 The only witch who will aid Marcel is Davina .
 I just need to get one last bit of leverage before I pay her a visit ...

 And there it is .
 Hello , Joshua .
 Agh ...
 Davina ...
 Uh ! Josh ?
 I 'm sorry . What happened ?
 Joshua went and got himself a werewolf bite .
 Well , a hybrid bite , technically , but it will kill him just the same .
 Why are you doing this ?
 I blame you .
 After all my overtures of friendship , you once again sided with Marcel , forcing me to do horrible things to someone you care about .
 I 'm not without mercy , Davina .
 I can cure him , but you have to cooperate and tell me where to find Marcel .
 Why , so you can kill him , too ?
 Marcel chose his path .
 Seems unfair that Josh should have to suffer for it .
 Davina ...
 He 's at a warehouse at the docks ...
 Thierry 's place . You see ?
 That wasn 't so hard , now , was it ?
 What about Josh ?
 Well , he 'll live another 24 hours or so . I may need you , and Joshua serves as wonderful leverage .
 The next time I ask a question , answer quicker .
 I didn 't realize my uncle even had this place until a read about it in his will .
 This building has been in my family for decades .
 You uncle helped us raise the funds to restore it after Katrina .
 I figured he 'd kept this room for extra space .
 Anyway , I didn 't ask any questions .
 You know , Father K. , he was as good as they come .
 Sorry for your loss .
 Um ...
 Do you mind if I go in alone ?

 Here 's to buried treasure .
 Hello .

 Elijah should 've called by now .
 Worrying isn 't going to help .
 You should sit down , try to keep calm .
 What are you now , magician- slash- zen life coach ?
 The treatment of pregnant women has advanced remarkably since I was a nurse , but even I know high blood pressure is bad for you and your baby , especially now that you 're so close to term .
 I hate this .
 I feel completely useless .
 Don 't you get it ?
 You 're the point of all this .
 Klaus and Elijah running all over town , it 's all for you .
 I 'm a bit envious .
 Great . Lucky me .
 Is there anything I can get you ?
 How about a moonlight ring ?
 The spell can 't be performed until the full moon reaches its apex , and , of course , I need the stones , which will be here soon enough .
 Have a little faith .
 Accolades to Marcel .
 He did quite a dance across the bridge of your nose .
 Where is he now ?
 Nowhere to be found ...
 Although he did leave us a delightful parting gift .
 What about the stones ?
 I don 't know .
 Untie me . I 'll help you find them .
 Sit still .
 You 'll be freed as soon as it 's safe .
 Our focus should be the stones .
 Considering Jackson is competition for Hayley 's affection , I think you 'd agree .
 Over the course of the last millennium , his capacity for tact is somewhat diminished .
 Oh , that 's typical , isn 't it ?
 Marcel fills a room with dynamite , and yet I 'm the tactless one .
 I recognize these explosives from the attack on the bayou .
 Could you remind me again why you believed that Marcel was innocent ?
 Remind me to ask him before I pull out his innards .
 Ah . Ok .
 Exercise extreme caution in this general area .
 Bit of a mess .
 Impeccable timing .
 What 's going on ?
 He 's a little tied up right now .
 Could we call you back ? Oh , that doesn 't bode well .
 Jackson ; Are you trying to kill us ?
 Elijah , tell me what 's going on now .


 Thank God you 're alive .
 Ok .
 Thanks for asking .
 What about the stones ?
 Scattered across the bed of the Mississippi , I imagine .
 He knows an empowered werewolf army would mean the end of vampires in New Orleans .
 The explosion is his way of saying he means to prevent that , for all the good it 'll do him .
 Well , it did him pretty damn well , didn 't it ?
 I will find a way to fix it .
 No , Jack . You 're hurt , and no one is blaming you .
 I 'm blaming you .
 Those stones will be hard to replace .
 Fortunately , I always have a backup plan .
 She 's a gangster .
 I see her more as a means to procuring rare items at short notice .
 Greetings , Ms. Correa .
 I see you 've brought company .
 These are my brothers .
 I always include them in delicate business matters .
 Fellas , meet Mr. Mikaelson .
 Please , call me Klaus .
 All my friends do .
 I don 't know if I 'd call us friends , but if you and Marcel are planning on having a little throwdown ,
 I 'd prefer my family to be on the same side as the inevitable Victor .
 Then you have what I asked for . Not enough for an army at such short notice , but it 's start .
 Strange , I wasn 't aware that she was familiar with our plan .
 My price for doing business is full disclosure .
 Your brother complied .
 How does the human faction expect to benefit from all this ?
 I only want to solidify our allegiance to the ruling class .
 It 's good for business . your capacity for reason .
 Sadly , they don 't .
 Marcel is being especially vindictive .
 I 'm worried he might come after me or my family just for meeting with you .
 It might be in our best interests if we combine our efforts .
 So be it .
 The more bodies we have to defend the compound , the better .
 Let 's get started , shall we ?

 There .
 Thank you .
 Don 't thank me .
 It was Elijah who vamped your ass to safety . Yeah .
 He really seems to care about you .
 It 's complicated .
 I think that 's the understatement of the year .
 Look .
 I got to go , get back to the bayou before the moon rises , so ...
 Jackson , this will be the last time .
 After tonight , you 'll never have to turn again ...
 No more pain , no more hiding in the bayou , I promise .
 You know , Klaus isn 't doing this out of the kindness of his heart . He 's doing it for you , Hayley .
 You 're the one who 's gonna change everything for us .
 Seems I owe you yet again .
 I understand he risked his life to save his friend .
 He 's a good man .
 Yes . He is .
 Elijah , there is something that I need to tell you .
 My family wanted me ...
 I was supposed to be betrothed to Jackson .
 I wanted to tell you sooner .
 I just didn 't know how .
 It 's this insane custom .
 No . You don 't need to explain anything .
 I understand the need to make sacrifices for one 's family .
 Oh , come on , Elijah .
 For once in your immortal life , can you just not be so noble ?
 What would you have me do ?
 I just told you that I 'm betrothed according to some backwater arrangement by people that I never knew .
 Tell me that you think betrothals are stupid .
 Tell me that I have a choice .
 You will always have a choice .
 I trust you are ready .
 The last ingredient is personal .
 As this spell is designed to control transformation ,
 I need the blood of a werewolf who doesn 't turn on a full moon .
 My first thought was Hayley because of the pregnancy .
 Out of the question .
 I 'd just as soon limit the mother of my unborn child to the side effects of your witchery .
 I am half wolf .
 I control my form .
 Use my blood .
 If you fail to uphold your end of the deal , the consequences for you will be apocalyptic .
 You say the most romantic things .
 I appreciate you all coming .
 It 's been a while .
 By now , you 've heard what 's going on . Klaus found a way to make werewolves lethal to us 24/ 7 .
 The fireworks at the docks , that was me trying to spoil his plan .
 He 's moving forward , anyway .
 He 's got as witch , he 's got a spell , and if he pulls this off , in one night , we go from hunter to prey .
 Now , I know what some of y 'all are thinking .
 " We stood against Klaus before , and we failed . "
 Uh- uh .
 That 's on me .
 I failed .
 I called off the attack because I thought it was the only way to save lives , but make no mistake .
 If we don 't stand against him now , our lives aren 't worth a damn , anyway .
 Yeah .
 Wise man said , " if you know yourself and know your enemy " , then you don 't need to fear the outcome of battle . "
 I know myself , I know my friends , and I know my enemy .
 I know his strengths , I know his pride , and I know his house , every nook and cranny .
 We 're gonna go there tonight hard and fast all at once from every angle .
 We kill their witch , destroy her spell book , and get the hell out ...
 Yeah ! Yeah !
 And as for Klaus , he 'll be coming for me , and that 's exactly what I want .
 I 'll lead him away .
 I just need the rest of you to get past Elijah and do what needs to be done .
 So that 's the plan .
 I need to know right now , who 's with me ?
 Yeah !
 Yeah !
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 My people say Marcel is on the move and he 's bringing friends .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse . Get Hayley to safety .

 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Come with me .
 No .
 Someone needs to watch her .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse . You should help Klaus .
 My brothers and their security detail won 't be much against a vampire army .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 I 'll stay with Hayley .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Go , Elijah ...
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 And don 't hold back .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .

 I thought this lot would 've learned their lesson .
 Well , they 're not exactly renowned for their genius .
 So where 's the ringleader of this circus ...
 Too afraid to show his face ?
 I 'm gonna offer you one last chance to pack your stuff and get the hell out of my town . men to rush to their deaths again ?

 Every vampire in the quarter came out .
 They want their city back , no surrender this time .
 You 're gonna have to kill us all .
 Ok .
 I think I 'll start with you .
 Fine .
 Come get me .
 If you don 't kill him , I will .
 He 's mine . This won 't take long .
 Gentlemen ...
 Shall we ?
 Raah !
 Raah !

 Not bad , but not nearly good enough .

 How pathetic you 've become .
 Explosives , Marcellus , really ?
 I should 've know it was you who detonated those bombs in the bayou .
 The docks , that was me .
 I got the detonators from Francesca .
 Why don 't you ask her about the bayou bombing ? Lies and distractions .
 I never went after Hayley .
 I 'm not a monster , Klaus .
 I 'm not you .



 My family has been in New Orleans for a long time .


 Take him down now !

 Ms. Correa , we need to go .
 Your brothers are already heading out the back .
 Not yet .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .
 Matera et lunare tua virtuse .


 The stones are finished .
 I 've done my part . Now it 's up to you .
 I 'll get them to the bayou .
 Actually , she was talking to me .
 What the hell is this ?
 Call it a side deal .
 Point is , I 'm taking the stones .
 Are you out of your mind ?
 You think that humans can go up against Klaus ?
 No .
 I don 't , but I 'm not human .

 I 'm like you , Hayley , and now I 'm gonna take back my town .
 Like hell , you are .


 Don 't look so dour , Genevieve .
 We both got what we wanted .


 Marcellus , how well your name fits you ,
 little warrior , though ultimately one of no consequence .

 My name is Marcel .

 Is there no end to your defiance ?
 You summoned Mikael , turned Rebekah against me , tried to bury me in your garden , and yet you always fail .
 What is there left to do but put you out of your misery ?
 Raah !

 Hayley , I 've called 6 times .
 Call me back .
 You said you wanted to know if I learned anything about Francesca Correa . Her family is descended from a werewolf bloodline .

 We 've spent two generations living a lie , and now our time ...
 Our time has come .
 You know what do to .
 Aagh !
 Ahh !
 Uh !
 Uh !
 Uh !
 Yeah .
 Agh !
 Raah !

 Are we done ?
 Saved me the trouble of killing all these vampires myself .
 Rrgh !
 Raah !
 Aagh ! Argh ! Rrgh !
 Agh !
 Aah !
 Run !
 Kill as many of them as you can .
 Aagh !
 Aah !
 Raah !
 Aah !
 I 'm sorry , mate , but I 'm a bit famished .
 No .
 No !
 Aah !
 Raagh !
 Arr ...
 Oh ... Uh ...
 Ha !
 You look awful .
 Why aren 't I healing ? What have you done to me ?
 You were the one that wanted me to cast the spell .
 So I made your stones by linking their power to your blood , and now each full moon whenever a werewolf uses their power to keep from turning , they will be drawing from your strength and causing you pain .

 After all I offered you , you will betray me ?
 Look me in the eyes , Nik .
 Were you ever planning to give me your mother 's grimoire ?
 Did you care about me , even for a moment ?
 I suppose you 'll never know .

 Francesca kept her end of the deal .
 There is , after all , honor among thieves , even if they are werewolves , and as for you , the great irony is , in wanting to take the city , you 've lost everything ...
 Your sister Rebekah , your adopted son Marcel ...
 And now even your child and her mother will suffer , all because of your greed .
 Raah !
 Aagh !
 I will kill you .
 As weak as you are ?
 Doubtful .
 Aah !
 Josh , please drink this .
 Oh , man .
 Just hang on , please .

 No !
 Surely , you 're not surprised .
 Deep down , you knew Niklaus would leave Joshua to die .
 Why are you still here ?
 I haven 't much time left , but then , neither does your friend .
 I can heal him .
 I 'll find a way . Even if you could , how long till it happens again ?
 As long as Niklaus remains in New Orleans , you and your loved ones will continue to suffer his torment .
 I am the only man in history who 's been able to drive him off , to bring him fear and pain .
 If your friend needs Klaus ' blood to survive ,
 I 've been known to spill a fair share of it .
 You 'll help me save Josh ?
 I do have personal reasons for wanting Niklaus to suffer , but , yes , I 'd like nothing more than you help you .

 And all I have to do is raise you from the dead .
 A small price to pay to cure your friend and live a life free of a monster .
 Think , Davina . There still exists a weapon that can kill Klaus .
 Bring back the one being who has the strength to use it .


 Who were you talking to ?
 Doesn 't matter .
 I 'm gonna fix you .


 It 's done . A deal is a deal .

 You said the bombing was gonna be minor , no casualties .
 All I wanted to do was rally the crescents against the vampires .
 And isn 't that exactly what happened ?
 People died ... My people , my pack !
 Your pack ? That 's funny ...
 Because it looked to me like they were ready to follow Hayley , but now , thanks to me , we have control of the very thing that will inspire loyalty from both the crescents and the Guerreras ...
 The means to make our people even more powerful .
 The only thing I had to trade away was the one person who could 've challenged us .
 Poor Hayley . It is a shame .
 The witches drive a hard bargain , but every revolution requires sacrifice .
 This city will belong to the wolves again .
 All we have to do ...
 Is take it .



 No .
 No .
 No , no , no , no , no . No .

 No .
 No . No .
 No .
 No , no , no !
 Marcel ...
 Marcel , I 'm sorry .
 Uh . Uh !
 Uh ! Uh ...

 Oh , my God , Marcel , I 've been trying to find someone , anyone .
 What 's happening ?
 You need to get out of here .
 My guys have been bitten by wolves .
 They 'll get sick and then blood- crazy .
 We need to find Klaus . His blood can heal you .

 Where is she ?

 Where 's Hayley ? He doesn 't have her . Please .
 I know you don 't trust him , but you know I wouldn 't lie .
 He doesn 't have her .
 Someone does .

 Where 's my brother ?
 I left him in the street .
 He was gonna kill me , and then he got jacked up by some witch 's spell .
 Genevieve .



 Get her down on the floor .
 We should take her to the city of the dead . We won 't make it .
 The baby is coming now . No . It 's too soon .
 Aah !
 Apparently not .
 The plan was to induce her when the sacrifice was ready .
 I had to subdue her , and the trauma caused a placental abruption .
 So the baby is coming , and we 'll just have to adapt .
 You need to be calm , Hayley .
 Why are you doing this to me ? To be reborn , we must sacrifice .
 What the hell does that mean , you psychotic , little bitch ?
 The ancestors demand an offering in exchange for power .
 And you child will be a fine offering .
 No . No .
 You will not take my baby . I will kill all of you .
 No , you won 't , and neither will Klaus or Elijah .
 When your baby is born , we will offer it up to those who came before us .
 I 'm sorry , Hayley , but this is the way it had to be .
 No .
 No !
 No !
 No !
 Aah !
 Arrgh !
 Raagh !
