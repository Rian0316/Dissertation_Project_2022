 This is both strike one and strike two .
 Howard can 't just stick you in doc review because of something I did .
 I told you this would happen .
 I screwed up !
 That came from a bullet !
 That 's it , we 're getting you and Kaylee out of this house .
 Wallet !
 Let go !
 That all you got ?
 What did I do that was so wrong ?
 You 're like an alcoholic who refuses to admit he 's got a problem .
 Come on down , chuck !
 Roll around in the dirt with me !
 - Wonderful . - ‭Are the leeks too overpowering ?
 Not at all .
 That 's as good ‭as the one we had in Florence .
 - All right , don 't humor me . ‭ - I 'm not .
 How was rehearsal ?
 Did what 's- her- name behave herself ?
 She takes the whole section for granted .
 I 'm debating ‭whether to say something .
 I think you should , absolutely .
 Don 't keep it inside .
 Ready for the chiffonade ?
 Yeah . Thanks .
 And after all , if she 's compromising the work ...
 Mm . Well , it 's debatable .
 I mean , the Schubert is coming along nicely .
 It 's more about morale .
 Morale can affect quality .
 God knows the hoops that Howard jumps through
 - just to keep the troops humming . - ‭Well , true .
 You deserve a medal for this .
 Please . It 's no big deal .
 Your soy- ginger marinade ?
 Well , I found a citrus one that looked good , so I thought I would try that .
 Well , anyway , you are a trouper .
 I apologize in advance .
 Let 's just say he 's ... something of an acquired taste .
 Oh , how bad can he be ?
 Well , just in case , let 's have a high sign .
 How about ‭the old Carol Burnett thing ?
 Oh , where she pulls her earlobe ?
 Exactly .
 You do this , and I 'll say I have briefs to read ,
 - and we 'll get rid of him . - All right . Whatever you want .
 You know why she did that -- Carol Burnett ?
 It 's a great story .
 It was a signal to her grandmother , who had raised her , as --
 Seriously ?
 He 's early .
 You 're a doll .
 Holy shit . Look at this place .
 Hey , Jimmy , thanks for coming .
 Bring it on in here .
 Hey ! ‭Little taste of home for you .
 Had to look all over town to find a place that had it . ‭Didn 't have time to wrap it .
 Well , thanks .
 You 're good .
 Yeah .
 I 'm looking for a place .
 Been staying at the Ramada .
 And thanks for the help , by the way .
 I 've found a few that I like .
 This one place , ‭the beachcomber , has a pool .
 And since the Mcgill clan is whiter ‭than a pack of albino rats ... ‭ ... I figure I better start working on my tan .
 So , seriously considering that option .
 I strongly suggest sunscreen .
 We 're up about 5, 000 feet here .
 You 'll fry .
 Excellent point . Sunscreen -- check .
 So ... A violinist ?
 And according to Chuck , a crazy talented one at that .
 Mm . ‭I mean , wow .
 Well , Chuck is very gracious .
 She 's being modest .
 Rebecca is widely respected amongst her peers . ‭Yo- yo Ma came to our wedding .

 That 's , um ...
 Right on , man .
 About the wedding , um ,
 I 've been meaning ‭to apologize ... about that .
 - I am truly sorry I wasn 't ... - No worries , please .
 So , tell us about your first week at Hamlin , Hamlin , Mcgill .
 It was great .
 I mean , they got me working in the mailroom , which you gotta start somewhere .
 I learned how to use the Xerox machine , which is surprisingly complicated .
 I mean , press a button , a piece of paper spits out --
 Not anymore . ‭Mm .
 Thing 's practically a computer .
 It 's like goddamn space shuttle .
 It 's got , like , double- sided printing , automatic stapling , you know ?
 Met some nice folks -- guys and gals .
 Well , gal -- singular , actually .
 Learned everyone 's name , and I licked a ton of stamps .
 My tongue is like hamburger meat -- I mean , seriously .
 Yeah ?
 I got -- thing 's raw as hell .
 Then I found out ‭there 's a sponge for that .
 Oops ! Rookie mistake .
 Well , it sounds like you had a very productive week .
 Yeah , it was really great .
 Hey , guys , um ...
 Um , I want to thank you for having me over .
 This is , like , the best meal I 've had in a decade .
 I mean , the fish is perfection , and the , uh ...
 Risotto .
 Risotto .
 Thank you . That 's very kind .
 Well , you 're a wonderful chef , you know ?
 Aside from being super talented with the ...
 You got a good one , Chuck -- I mean , lucky , lucky man . ‭Well , ‭cheers to that .
 Pardon me .
 All right .
 What 's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a lawyer on a motorcycle ?
 The vacuum cleaner ‭has the dirt bag on the inside .

 Aha , lawyer jokes .
 I 've only been in the mailroom a week , and I 've heard maybe a hundred .
 Yeah . ‭It all comes ‭from a place of affection .
 Sure . Of course .
 What do you get when you cross the Godfather with a lawyer ?
 An offer you can 't understand .
 Very clever .
 Never heard that one .
 And believe me --
 I have nothing but the utmost respect for your profession .
 I mean , ‭it 's the pillar of -- oh !
 Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt ?
 Because deep down , ‭they 're really good people .
 Uh , w- what do you call a lawyer with an IQ of 60 ?
 " Your honor . "
 What 's the difference between a tick and a lawyer ?
 Oh , no .
 The tick falls off when you 're dead ! Bam !

 Love that one .
 You like that ? Just joking .
 I want you to know ‭how seriously I take my job .
 I 'm , uh , grateful for the -- oh .
 How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb ?
 Classic setup here .
 Three -- one to climb the ladder , one to shake it ,
 And one ‭to sue the ladder company .
 Comedy gold .
 - I 'm here all night ! - More . Go , go .
 Okay . Okay , okay , okay .
 Dessert , anyone ?
 We have a homemade blueberry crumble with vanilla ice cream .
 Yeah , blueberry crumble -- sounds terrific .
 I love a fruit- based , uh , blueberry --
 - Wait . I think I know one . - Oh , bring it on .
 Yeah , yeah .
 Um , what do lawyers and sperm have in common ?
 Oh , just ... ‭Um .
 3 million -- no , wait .
 Um , 1 in 3 million ...
 - have a chance ‭of becoming a human being . - Of becoming a human being .
 Love that one .
 Well , that went well , don 't you think ?
 Sure . Thanks again .
 I don 't know ‭what you were worried about .
 Jimmy 's great .
 Yeah . No , he 's ...
 Yeah .
 So , what 's going on tomorrow ?
 Well , I 've got the ‭Gernstetter deposition at 10 : 00 ,
 Back- to- back partner meetings after lunch .
 It shouldn 't be a late one .
 Thought any more about what 's- her- name ?
 It 's your reputation , too , you know ?
 Well , we start the Tchaikovsky on monday , so I 'll see what kind of mood she 's in when we wrap .
 Smart .
 What do you call 25 attorneys buried up to their chins in cement ?
 - Not enough cement . - ‭What ?





 Hello .

 You 've reached the voicemail of Kim Wexler .
 Please leave me a message , and I 'll get back to you as soon as I can .
 It 's me again .
 Look , I think I found something that could help get you outta there .
 I 'm gonna make things right .
 Call me , would you ?
 Hi .
 Sorry . I didn 't mean to sneak up on you .
 - I just thought everyone was gone . ‭ - Nope .
 I 'm here late most nights .
 By the way , ‭i noticed in your office ...
 You threw away a soda can .
 You 're going through my trash ?
 No .
 I was just dropping off papers at lunchtime , and I happened to notice it in your trash can .
 I fished it out , so it 's fine .
 Office cans ‭are for recyclable paper -- there 's a separate big can in the kitchen for plastic , glass , and aluminum .
 We take our ecological footprint pretty seriously here . okay , so , the big can is where I should throw my empty Scotch bottles .
 No , I- I get it .
 Go green .
 Good . Was there anything else ?
 Yeah , one quick thing .
 I have the brief you gave Cliff this morning -- the plaintiff 's opposition to the defendant 's motion ?
 I have a few notes .
 I think they 're pretty clear , but it 's probably easier if we just go over them together .
 Jesus . Th- those are Cliff 's ?
 No , they 're my notes .
 I 'd love go to over them now , if you have a minute .
 It looks worse than it is .
 It 's -- it 's just that we have a particular house style .
 Okay , no offense ,
 But , uh , you 're a second- year associate , right ?
 - Yep . ‭ - And I came in as a fourth- year .
 That 's right .
 So , why is a second- year giving notes to a fourth- year ?
 Well , like I said , I know the house style .
 Does Cliff have you babysitting me ?
 No .
 This is just one associate helping another .
 Like here , ‭the Roman numeral headings -- we use all caps for those .
 And you indented them , which is perfectly fine , but Cliff likes them centered .
 Oh , and before I forget , we put two spaces after a period on all our documents .
 I know it seems like a minor thing , but really looks so much cleaner on the page .
 You went a tad overboard with the quotations .
 It 's okay to present a quote from a controlling legal opinion , but when you use too many , it disrupts ‭the flow of your argument , and it gives the impression you don 't know how to write an argument of your own . ‭And I 'm sure you do , so ... ‭You have a tendency to overuse the words " Clearly " and " Obviously . "




 Again , it 's a matter of personal opinion --
 I really appreciate this , Erin ,
 But , uh , ‭I was just on my way out .
 So , if we could continue this first thing tomorrow morning ...
 Well , I was thinking we should just get 'er done now .
 No time like the present .
 Sure .
 Let 's roll up our sleeves and apply a little elbow grease .
 Great !
 So , I 'm gonna get my favorite pen , and I will see you momentarily .
 You got it .
 Uh , Miss Wexler ?
 You can call me Kim .
 Kim , it 's 20 to midnight .
 Are you asking me if you can leave ?
 Guys , I 'm not your supervisor .
 Don 't stick around on my account .
 You coming , Kim ?
 Right behind you .
 Just finishing up this last one .

 Again , thanks .
 Hey , Gesualdo , could you skip vacuuming tonight , please ?
 Five minutes -- just give me five minutes .
 Here 's how we 're gonna handle this travesty of justice .
 Wexler vs. Hamlin , Hamlin , Mcgill --
 You want me to sue my own firm ?
 Filing 's all typed up . It 's ready to go .
 This is not my area of expertise , all right ?
 So , first order of business -- we get a great employment- law attorney .
 Show 'em we mean business .
 ‭Come on .
 Hey , look at you . ‭
 Okay , you 're here at midnight in this glorified cellblock busting your ass -- for what ?
 It has nothing to do with your performance .
 You 're being mistreated .
 Chuck is punishing you to get to me .
 This is extortion , pure and simple .
 No , that 's Howard , ‭who has an image to uphold .
 He did the same thing after the Kettleman fiasco , and Chuck was nowhere in sight .
 I 'm telling you -- Chuck is behind this .
 No , you are behind this .
 I told you this would happen , and now I 'm paying the price .
 I shoulda known better .
 So now I 'm keeping my head down , and I 'm getting through this .
 And I 'm most certainly not suing HHM .
 - Kim - Even if I won , who would hire me ?
 That would be career suicide .
 All right .
 Then I quit Davis & Main .
 What does that accomplish ?
 It 's the only way to get you outta dutch because this is about Chuck , whether you want to believe it or not .
 I give him what he wants -- he lets up on you .
 My knight in shining armor .
 That is some sacrifice --
 Quitng a job that you 've been trying to tank since day one .
 That 's not true .
 I dig myself out of this hole .
 You do your job , Jimmy .
 Prove you can go one week -- hell , one day -- without breaking the rules of the New Mexico Bar Association or pissing off your boss .
 And don 't insult my intelligence by saying you are doing any of this for me .
 You don 't save me .
 I save me .
 Just please go .

 Hey , is Erin in yet ?
 God damn pixie ninja .
 I owe you a big apology .
 I have a medical condition --
 Gerd , ‭gastroesophageal reflux disease .
 I know -- it 's a mouthful , right ?
 It affects ‭the lower esophageal sphincter .
 I took a risk yesterday at lunch with some onion rings , and last night --
 Are we doing this or not ?
 You bet .
 Hey , Jerry . It 's Kim Wexler .
 How 's things with the alumni group ?
 Top 50 ?
 Go , UNM law !
 Hey , wondering if you 've heard that Santa Fe place is looking for new outside counsel .
 They should really be considering
 Hamlin , Hamlin , Mcgill . We --
 Must 've just been a rumor .
 Yeah , let 's grab a drink soon .
 You too . Okay , bye .
 Hey , uh , I remember you mentioned your brother worked in Intel 's legal department .
 I 'm an attorney at Hamlin , Hamlin , Mcgill .
 Would you happen to know if Intel is happy with their legal representation ?
 That 's -- that 's flattering , but I 'm seeing someone at the moment , so ... you know what ?
 Just call the main number , and they 'll find me .
 Yeah , no , we had drinks a few days ago .
 And she said you had a friend who ...
 Oh , so they already settled .
 I heard you ended up at harvard law .
 Yeah , yeah , she was my roommate .
 Listen , uh , I 'an attorney at Hamlin , Hamlin , Mcgill .
 We 're actually known for teaming with other firms on large contracts .
 Schweikart ?
 Sure . Yeah , I know them well . It 's a great firm .
 We met at that ABA mixer last year .
 Yep , bourbon shots .
 That was me . well , congrats on landing that Honeywell contract --
 Huge amount of work .
 You , too .
 - How was your lunch ? - ‭Good .
 What 'd you have ? ‭Uh , turkey wrap .
 How 's the place ?
 It 's great .
 It 's safe , quiet .
 They allow dogs .
 I can 't ask for more than that .
 I can 't get Kaylee out of the pool .
 By the end of the day , she 's a prune . ‭I 'm glad she 's enjoying it .
 Hey , I better get her dinner started soon .
 Go to the restaurant .
 No , it 's too expensive . I have groceries in the room .
 Oh , don 't worry about that .
 - Take her out . ‭ - Thanks , Mike .
 She misses you .
 Do you think you might come by later ?
 Oh , not yet .
 I don 't want her to see me lookin like this .
 How bad was it ?
 Well , I can tell ya the next car I get 's gonna have airbags .
 Well , ‭whenever you feel you 're ready .
 Ah , it 's okay . ‭It looks worse than it is .
 You give Kaylee a kiss for me .
 I will .
 All right . Bye , darlin .
 Hold up .
 What the hell happened to you ?
 I get it -- the first rule of fight club , right ?
 Uh , let me introduce you .
 This is my babysitter , Erin .
 Erin , this is my grandpa , Mike .
 Nice to meet you .
 Thanks , Tim .
 Good seein you , Jimmy .
 Listen , this clerk and I go way back .
 We 're like this .
 But she needs a little finessing , so can I handle it ?
 Yeah , sure .
 Surprise !
 Bet you never thought you 'd see me again .
 I need a summary judgment hearing with Michaelis for Bray v. O 'Connell ,
 And I 'm hopin for Thursday at 10 : 00 , before he , uh ...
 Don 't have it .
 Thursday at noon , perhaps ?
 Nope .
 Thursday at 2 : 00 -- now , that 's my final --
 You 're pretty .
 Will you be my new mommy ?
 What are you doing ? !
 - What ? ‭ - That 's a bribe .
 It 's a gift .
 That 's how it works here -- grease the wheels of justice .
 - Give me -- - That 's not how it works .
 You submit the paperwork , and you get a date -- period .
 What don 't you understand about finessing ?
 I apologize for my colleague .
 She 's new .
 Is there any possible way we could still get Thursday ?
 I 'll give you 2 : 30 Thursday .
 The 14th .
 That 's next month .
 We 'll take it .
 So , does this go ‭on my official stasi report ?
 I 'm not trying to get you in trouble --
 I 'm trying to keep you out of it .
 I 'm gonna hit the men 's room .
 The men 's room .
 Hey , how you doing , Bill ?
 How am I doing ? How are you ?
 Oh , you know , hanging in .
 Yeah , word on the street is you 're over at Davis & Main now .
 You lucky son of a bitch .
 Ah , you know , dancing with the devil .
 So , how are things ‭at the district attorney 's --
 Davis & main !
 Man , that must be sweet !
 Give you a car ?
 Bet they gave you a car .
 Yeah . They gave me a car .
 - What kind ? - ‭It 's a --
 No , don 't tell me . I don 't want to know .
 I bet it 's German . Is it German ?
 Yeah , it 's German .
 Uh , the cup holder 's actually --
 You have a sick office ?
 I bet you have a sick office .
 Pretty sick .
 It 's got a little fireplace .
 Fireplace ?
 I 'd kill my mother for a fireplace .
 Hell , I 'd kill her for a window .
 You , uh , you have an assistant , right ?
 Don 't tell me -- is she hot ?
 She 's hot , right ?
 She is a bright young man named omar .
 Omar .
 Hey , you got a little something on your , uh ...
 That 's vomit ... Again .
 The worst part --
 Could 've come ‭from two different defendants .
 Scumbags . They 're all scumbags .
 Oh , my god . Where you living ? They put you up ?
 It 's a corporate apartment . It 's just --
 Ah , no , don 't tell me .
 Christ .
 Ah , damn it . I gotta run .
 I 'm putting away ‭some brain- dead suck wad ... who tried to rob a library .
 Good seeing you , Bill .
 Have a great day .
 Lucky bastard .
 Hello . Hi .
 It 's Kim Wexler .
 I did leave a message , and I was just ...
 Yes , ma 'am .
 Sorry to bother you .
 Hi . This is Kim Wexler .
 I was looking for Carolyn Lipitz .
 No , not his secretary . I 'm an attorney .
 Yes , I did -- I got your number from Chris .
 Sure . I will let them know .
 Okay . Nope , got it .
 Totally understand .
 This is Kim Wexler from Hamlin Hamlin & Mcgill .
 Actually -- hey -- can I just --
 Would you tell him I 'll call him right back ?
 Okay . Just let me know when is a good time .
 Got it .
 Okay . Thanks for your time .
 Hi , Claudia .
 It 's Kim Wexler .
 I 'll let him know .
 This is Kim Wexler .
 I was looking for a Jillian Kogan .
 I met you last year at an ABA mixer .
 You know I have a fear of heights .
 Keep coming every summer .
 All right , just give me a call . Great .
 Kim wexler . I did call yesterday .
 Okay . I totally get it .
 Kim wexler . Hey . How are you , Paige ?
 You did ?
 That 's -- that 's so nice to hear .
 I thought we hit it off , as well .
 Really ?
 I --
 I , uh , I- I couldn 't be more thrilled .
 It -- I mean , the firm and I.
 Absolutely . I 'll tell him right now .
 I 'm sure we can get something on the books tomorrow --
 Day after , at the latest .
 Thank you , Paige .
 Me , too . Okay , bye .
 Yes !
 - There she is . ‭ - Hi .
 - Hi . - ‭Paige , so good to see you .
 You , too .
 Kim , this is Kevin Wachtell , our C. E. O.
 Kim Wexler . ‭Great to meet you , Kevin .
 And you .
 Uh , Paige , Kevin , this is Howard Hamlin , our senior partner .
 - Pleasure . - ‭Likewise .
 We 're thrilled ‭to have you folks here .
 Kevin , true story -- when I was 7 years old , my very first bank account was at Mesa Verde , if you ‭can believe it .
 I can . Mine was , too , back when my dad ran the place .
 I can remember ‭the cover of my first passbook .
 - It was a silhouette of a ... - Cowboy .
 Cowboy on horseback , yes , standing next to a cactus .
 I loved that cowboy .
 Far as I was concerned , I was saving up for that horse .
 What the heck else is money good for when you 're 7 years old ?
 So , we have ‭a little presentation for you in our conference room , along with some snacks and a soymilk latte with your name on it .
 This one -- she 's a keeper .
 Shall we ?
 Let 's do it .
 Well , I think that ‭couldn 't have gone any better .
 - Pleasure to meet you . - ‭Fantastic . I 'll see you soon .
 Thanks for setting this up . Talk to you soon .
 Lovely to meet you , Paige .
 Congratulations .
 Right back at you .
 I 'll circle back with Paige , get the ball rolling , start talking strategy , you know ?
 Maybe ... put together a list of staff associates we can put on this .
 I 'll put Francis on that .
 You 've got enough on your plate in doc review .
 Coming .
 Catch you at a bad time ?
 Not at all . Come in .
 I hear clinking .
 Does that mean ‭we have something to celebrate ?
 We sure do .
 What are we drinking to ?
 Got a juicy one for you .
 - Mesa Verde ? - ‭On retainer .
 Oh , even better .
 Congratulations .
 One of your golf- course conquests ?
 Kim Wexler brought them in .
 Fourth- year associate snags a quarter of a million in billings ?
 She 's probably having a couple of drinks herself .
 She 's out of the doghouse , I assume ?
 We 'll see .
 Interstate expansion -- it 's a complex case .
 That 's two , maybe three regulatory commissions we 'll be dealing with
 Months of work for HHM , maybe years .
 Good morning , Rudolpho .
 Good morning , Mr. McGill .
 Oh , sorry .
 I didn 't know anyone was here .
 Just dropping off some Sandpiper stuff .
 You 're in early .
 More like late .
 Well , regardless of the hour , good to see you here .
 Yeah , ‭I 'm trying something new .
 I 'm coming in , working until 9 : 00 .
 It 's easier before the place opens , without all the lights and the phones ringing .
 How about some coffee ?
 No , thank you .
 W- would you mind making me some ?
 I apologize .
 It 's just I- I can 't do it myself , what with the electricity .
 - Sure . ‭ - No sugar .
 Just a splash of soy milk .
 I think we have it .
 Kim ?
 Um , make two cups .
 Well , I guess it 's true what they say --
 The early bird gets the worm , which is good if you like worms .
 May I ask you a question ?
 Of course .
 Do I have a future at this firm ?
 We have a lot in common , you and I.
 My brother left you holding the bag .
 If it makes you feel any better , you 're not the first person to go out on a limb for him .
 I made the same mistake over and over again .
 And now Howard has ...
 And he blames you .
 It 's a damned mess .
 Jimmy ever tell you anything about our father ?
 Not much , no .
 My dad -- our dad -- he was -- well ... the personification of good .
 I 'm not sure he could even see sin in any form ,
 like he was born without the gene .
 He ran a little corner store in Cicero -- cigarettes behind the counter , penny candy -- nothing special , ‭but it kept food on the table .
 And the neighborhood loved dad .
 He knew everybody 's name , what was going on in their lives .
 This little corner -- he made it better .
 I was named after him .
 Before that , he 'd worked for a lot of people over the years , and his dream was to be his own boss -- put everything he had into that place .
 I was away at college when he put Jimmy to work there .
 Jimmy grew up in that store , watching our father .
 But dad was not the world 's greatest businessman , and eventually , ‭he ran into money troubles .
 I , um , ‭had a clerkship at the time , but I came home to help him get his books in order , set the ship straight .
 Now , I 'm no accountant , but I discovered $14, 000 was just gone .
 Vanished over the years .
 Turns out Jimmy had pilfered it in dribs and drabs -- just took it out of the till .
 My dad wouldn 't hear it .
 Nope . Not his Jimmy .
 He ended up having to sell .
 Six months later , he was dead .
 At the funeral , ‭no one cried harder than Jimmy .
 My brother is not a bad person .
 He has a good heart .
 It 's just ...
 ... he can 't help himself .
 And everyone 's left picking up the pieces .
 Is there any coffee left ?
 No , I got it .
 I 'll talk to Howard , pour a little oil on troubled waters .
 You 're being wasted down in doc review .
 Good job with Mesa Verde .

 Mind if I join you ?
 Hi .
 What can I get you ?
 Coffee -- black .
 Coming right up .
 He really did a number on you .
 Sorry . I know you ?
 The young man who did that to you .
 He 's my nephew -- ‭hothead , always has been .
 Kid thinks he 's a boxer .
 He should have shown you respect .
 I apologize to you on behalf of my family .
 Apology accepted .
 And you know what ?
 He should go to jail -- best thing for him .
 Teach him respect for his elders .
 But ... not for eight years --
 less , much less .
 You see what I 'm getting at ?
 Not really .
 The gun charge -- that 's 8 years he 's going away , maybe 10 .
 Aggravated assault , the gun , plus he got your wallet .
 That 's right .
 I would like for you to tell the police that the gun was yours .
 Would you ?
 You 're both ‭a little hot under the collar about whether ‭you bumped his car or not .
 But there was a scuffle , and , uh , he got your gun .
 My gun ?
 Your gun from your pocket -- he got it , and that 's how his prints got on it .
 And then I 'd be subject to the gun charge .
 You 're an ex- cop .
 They 'll go easy on you .
 So you 're a psychic .
 I 'll even twist Tuco 's ear , make him apologize .
 And he serves for battery -- nothing else .
 I 'm looking for the best possible outcome for everybody .
 And for your trouble ... you take home $5, 000 .
 Think about it .
