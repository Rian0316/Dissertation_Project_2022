 I 'm Max . I 'll be your waitress ,

 ' cause they don 't do background checks here .
 Oh , you 'll be our waitress .
 I never guessed that based on the uniform and name tag that says " Max . "
 You know I make , like , $3 , right ?
 I realize that 's a lot of money in the 1920s where you two are from .
 Here , open this and bring us two clean glasses .
 Sure , Not- so- great Gatsby .
 Hey , OJ and Nicole .
 Rude snobs at table ten . You know what that means .

 Wine swap ?
 Let 's roll .
 Hey , Oleg , I need one of those $2 merlots you get from your cousin with the hole in his neck .
 Caroline , price check .
 Oh ! Chateau Pavie , 2008 .
 Very expensive .
 But , hey , we deserve it .
 Here , better let it breathe .
 It was in my gym bag .
 Not a problem .
 This vintage pairs well with jockstrap .
 Do you think waitresses did this to me when I had money ?
 Only if you had an attitude .
 ( both ) So that 's a yes .
 I can 't remember if this reminds me of an old heist movie I saw on an old heist
 I actually participated in .
 I know . We 're like Ocean 's 7/ 11 .

 All we 're missing is a tiny asian guy who can fit into small boxes .
 Hello .
 Table ten is looking for their wine .
 Oh , not a problem .
 Coming right up .
 What did you do ?
 Why is she smiling ?
 Are my pants on fire again ?
 ( Peter Bjorn and John ) ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪ ( Cash register bell dings ) ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

 [ Metal clanks , mouse squeaks ]
 Oh , yeah , take that , sucker !
 [ mouse squeaking ]
 Max , when I said we need to move the cupcakes ,
 I didn 't mean through the air at a rodent 's head .
 Hey , he ran up the window , so it 's kind of a stand- your- ground situation .
 [ metal clanks , mouse squeaks ] Okay , we 're on a time- out .
 He 's eating my ammo .
 Max , business is down again , and the only phrase I 've said more than that is ,
 " Please , god , take me in my sleep . "
 I mean , it 's clear .
 Not getting ahead .
 Oh , is that what your mood is about ?
 You 're not getting any ahead ?
 ' Cause I can take care of that with one call .
 You are not hooking me up with that guy who 's listed in your phone as " Oral Redenbacher . "
 Max , this is our future .
 We need to get serious about making money .
 Absolutely .
 Let 's leave early .
 Leave early ?
 Who are we , congress ?
 Do you think other business got successful by leaving early ?
 No , they did it by hiring illegals and moving their bank accounts offshore .
 We can 't leave early .
 The sign says " open till 2 : 00 A. M. "
 Well , I 'm open to getting a new sign that says " closed . "
 I mean , are we supposed to just hang around here and wait for whatever nut jobs are trolling around town ?
 Hi , girls .
 Guess what Oleg and I are going to do that will probably give me Hep C.
 A three way with Tommy Lee ?
 No , silly . We 're getting matching tattoos .

 We want something that represents our relationship .
 So maybe two butterflies doing the nasty during " CSl :
 Miami . "
 Wow , you two , his and her tats .
 Romantic and will help identify the bodies .
 Sure , you know , matching tattoos are the deepest expression of commitment .
 Well , matching tattoos and pooping in front of each other .
 I 'm not gonna do it in front of my man .
 I poop at McDonald 's 'cause I 'm a lady .
 Thanks for the cupcake .
 We really have to start charging her .
 Charge her with what , first- degree man- settling ?
 Max , as I was saying , it 's time to get serious about the business .
 Absolutely .
 Let 's leave early .
 Last night after 1 : 00 , we made only $15 , right ? $14 . 63 . What ?



 What ?
 Math is my thing .
 Would you roll your eyes if you were standing across from Eminem and he started rapping ?
 Uh , yes .
 I 'd be all , " Dude , you 're 60 .
 Sit on a porch swing . "
 Okay , look , here is $15 .
 That 'll cover what we 'll probably make .
 I 'm leaving .
 You 're just gonna leave me here ?
 Yup , I 'm leaving as soon as I get my change back from that $14 . 63 .
 Fine , just tell me how much that is .
 Or maybe sooner .
 This is a very big day for me .
 Why , because of this totally out- of- the- blue order we got to do cupcakes for this business seminar ?
 No , the first time I 've entered a Sheridan through a door .
 Usually it 's by window or freight elevator .
 And one time , I rolled in under some girl 's quinceañera dress .
 The seminar 's about to start .
 I have unclaimed name tags for Pamela , Ellen ...
 What kind of losers would come to this ?
 Max , Caroline .
 I wouldn 't call us losers .
 Are you here ?
 Okay , so there is no cupcake order .
 I signed us up for this seminar .
 I carried cupcakes on a subway for nothing ?
 The annoying woman next to me talked the whole time .
 I was sitting next to you , Max .
 Look , I knew you wouldn 't come otherwise , and you need to be here .
 This is a business intervention .
 It 's not an intervention .
 Max , your behavior lately has affected me in the following ways .
 I can 't believe this .
 At least in my other interventions I was drunk .
 We need to do this seminar .
 Gordon Kepper is a genius .
 He 's gonna give our business a real bump .
 Guys giving me a bump is why they threw me that second intervention .
 Let 's go .
 Oh , mm , okay .
 See you .
 So this is your new thing , Max ?
 You 're just gonna walk out on me ?
 Actually , it 's an old thing .
 In fact , it 's kind of a family tradition .
 I learned from my father , whoever he is .
 Come on .
 It 's just two days .
 Two days ?
 No way .
 No freaking way .
 There 's a buffet and a dessert bar .
 Ooh , okay .
 Wait here , I 'll go pay .
 I brought some cash .
 And they 'll take an expired target gift card , right ?
 Oh , we are not paying .
 Here .
 Here , Pamela .
 Follow Ellen to the freight elevator .
 No way , Max .
 We are not sneaking in .
 How much is this thing ? $1, 000 .
 We 're sneaking in , Ellen .
 Now , you all are here today not only to find out what you are as a business but to find out who you are .
 I 'm a lady hoping there 's macaroni and cheese at that buffet .
 Who are you is your brand , and saying that a brand is simply a name is like saying Abraham Lincoln is simply a name , or Mahatma Gandhi , God .

 Who does this guy think he is ?
 I 'm sure you 're wondering , " Who does this guy think he is ? "
 Okay , that was weird .
 Or maybe this seems weird .
 I 've got chills .
 When it comes to business , people come up to me all the time .
 They say , " Gordon , business is hard , but I do what I can . " and they shrug .
 Now , is that the right attitude ?
 - ( all ) No .
 - Yes .
 To those people , I say , " don 't do what you can .
 Can what you do . "
 Don 't do what you can .
 Can what you do !
 Get it ?
 Do you get it ?
 - ( all ) Yes .
 - No .
 - You did not get it .
 - Shh .
 All right , everybody , reach under your chairs and pick up what you find there .
 Hope it 's a way out of here .
 Koosh balls ?
 Inside those cans , you will find the key to success in your business .
 Not unless the key is Rosie O 'Donnell 's career before her buzz cut .
 Truth .
 That 's the big secret to business .
 If people buy what you 're saying , they will buy what you 're selling .
 Max , stay alert . This could go to cult like that .

 I like to think of those things you 're holding as my truth balls .
 Screw this . Let 's get to the meatballs .

 Anytime in the next two days , one of you is up here selling you something that you feel is just bull ,
 Then toss it ...
 Max !
 I mean , Ellen !
 Yeah , baby .
 That is what I 'm talking about .
 Whoever threw that is not afraid to really go for it , and that will go a long way toward success in business .

 All right , cool , but is it a long way to the buffet ?
 ' Cause I am starving .
 Okay , everyone .
 Consider these small groups you 've broken into as little think tanks .
 I need you to work together and bring out your very best .
 [ snores ] Max !

 Don 't blame me .
 Blame the heavy cream at the fettuccini bar .
 Alfredo must be Italian for " roofie . "
 So , Ellen , tell us what you have , and I 'll tell you what we think .
 Oh , Ellen .
 That 's you .
 Oh , oh , yes , yes , that 's me .
 I 'm Ellen . Definitely an Ellen .

 See , I dance .
 Okay .
 Okay . Okay , now it 's weird .

 So , Ellen ...
 Let 's hear your B. B. B ....
 Your brilliant business brand .
 Uh ... [ chuckles ]
 [ stammers ] I- I don 't do the talking .
 Pamela does the talking .
 - Pam ?
 - Thanks , Ellen .
 Hello , everyone , my name is Pam Panning , and what my partner , Ellen , was trying to say is , we making very beautiful artisan cupcakes .
 Yeah , but they 're still cool .
 I never said they weren 't cool .
 Yeah , mm , maybe they just didn 't sound cool coming out of your face .
 I 'm sorry , but at least actual words are better than , " uh , uh- uh , uh ... "
 Ladies , hold .
 Sometimes in business partners ' ships will sail in two different directions , so you two need to find out if you 're gonna continue to sail apart or if you 're gonna change course and reconvene at the port of mutual understanding .


 Well , we can 't sail too far apart
 ' cause I 'm definitely gonna have to explain what you just said to her .
 I got it .
 I 'm a boat , and I 'm trying to get away from you .
 Sounds right to me .
 Think it over .
 Talk it over with your first mate .
 [ snickers ]
 Come back tomorrow and tell me who your business is , and I 'll help guide you toward that purpose .
 And remember , you can 't purpose without ...
 - Puss . - Okay , wow .

 Gordon , her boat 's kind of in shallow water right now , but we 're gonna go away , get it together , and come back and blow you away .
 And you can 't spell " blow you away " without ...
 Our ship 's leaving .
 Oh , hello .
 Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner .
 Can I get you anything , like a work ethic ?
 Han , this is adorable , but we 're busy .
 We 're pitching our business brand tomorrow , and Max and I need to get on the same page .
 Yeah , we don 't want to work here the rest of our lives .
 Well , now we 're all on the same page .
 Han , just give us ten minutes .
 Then we 'll get to work .
 Well , I 've waited four years .
 What 's another ten minutes ?
 Max , I have to say I was a little thrown by that thing you said today .
 What , that the best sex I 've ever had was alone on the Tilt- A- Whirl ?
 No , why would that throw me ? You say that every day .

 No , that thing about me not sounding cool .
 Why would that throw you ? I say it every day .

 Yes , but not about the business .
 So what was it ?
 The word " artisan " ?
 Okay , first of all , it sounds like fart- isan , as in , " a fart is in this room right now . "
 Somebody finally called you out on it , Caroline .
 So I was thinking our slogan could be ,
 " Max 's Homemade Cupcakes . Sugar and spice . "

 I 'd rather go with Fart- isan .
 Really , Beavis ?
 What does your business partner Butthead think ?
 Our business isn 't working .
 Well , guess who is working .
 Me , the damn owner .
 Why are you surprised ?
 You know how many cupcakes were not selling .
 I mean , you 're secretly eating at least six a night to make me think we 're selling more .
 Also 'cause I 'm sad .
 Look , I know you went to Wharton and all , but ...
 Wait ...
 What 's happening ?
 Is this a business intervention on me ?
 From someone who pronounces the word business " bidness " ?
 Why are you giving me the big eye- painting face ?
 You knew the business wasn 't working .
 Well , I don 't hear you coming up with any ideas .
 That 's 'cause you don 't listen .
 Remember when I said we should stop making all these flowery cupcakes and just make ones that say mean things
 like " eat it " and " lick me " ?
 Your big business plan is cupcakes that say " eat it " and " lick me " ?
 And other funny things like " loser " or " eat your feelings . "
 Hmm , why not just shoot people in the face when they come to the window ?
 And I thought the back of our T- shirt could just say , " cream filled . "
 So funny if , like , a hot girl was wearing it .
 And even funnier if it was a fat guy .
 Okay , maybe like Gordon said , our partner ships are going in different directions .
 My sugar and spice ship is going one way , and your mean and ugly booze cruise is going another .
 So how about tomorrow , I 'll sail my ship , and you can sail yours , Ellen .
 Done .
 And , Pam , I know you think your ship don 't sink , but it does .
 So , Hannah , Todd , go .
 Tell us , who is your business ?
 We make guitar case suitcases .
 Yeah , they 're suitcases that look like guitar cases so you can look cool at the airport .
 So far , no truth balls .
 That means we believe you 're telling some truth of who you are .
 Business is always ...
 Okay then .
 So what , their big idea is just throwing your crap in a guitar case ?
 Well , it 's no fart- isan cupcake .
 Todd , Hannah , did you get together with our graphic artist to help create a logo ?
 Yes , we did .
 We stayed up all night , and to be honest , it got kind of weird .
 That 's our logo , and our company 's called " I 'm With the Band . "
 Back off !
 She just got out of rehab .
 Business is not for the faint of heart or coke addicts .
 Next up , we 've got Ellen and Pam .
 Let 's give 'em some love .
 Max , you 're really not gonna go up there and sell your idea as a business plan .
 Yup , and I feel pretty good about it .
 Okay , well , then I hope you enjoy lots of balls in your face .
 If I didn 't at Burning Man ,
 I doubt I will here . Gordon , hi .
 As you predicted , today we 'll be presenting our brands separately .
 Okay , looks like we have us a brand off , folks .
 This is exciting .
 I am feeling it !
 Ellen , I know you 're not used to being alone .
 Neither was I , hence wife number three .
 Don 't rush .
 Take some time to get yourself centered . Yo , yo , yo !
 What 's happening , Sheridan !
 Ellen in the house .
 Let me hear some noise . Yeah . Oh !
 All right , all right .
 We got some haters .
 That 's cool .
 Ellen , did you design a logo ?
 Sure did .
 Show it , player .
 George , she 's talking to you .
 ( Gordon ) Oh , good impact .
 Boom , cupcake business .
 But , um ...
 Where 's the name of your business ?
 Oh , I didn 't want one .
 I just wanted it to be cool .
 So let me get this correct .
 You want to make T- shirts for your business with no business connection .
 Okay .
 This is your journey , but it might end here .
 No , no , no , see , it 's a cupcake , and we sell cupcakes , so that 's the " bidness . "
 Okay , you know what ? Screw this !
 That t- shirt is way cool , and if you can 't see it , this seminar is so not worth the $1, 000 I paid .
 Peace out .
 [ feedback whines ]
 In business , we call that a meltdown .
 It happens .
 So why don 't we bring up Ellen 's former partner Pam .
 Let 's give Pam a round of applause .
 Max , I don 't have to go up there .
 Come on , we can just leave .
 Oh , look who wants to pack up their guitar suitcase and go .
 You know what ?
 I was only leaving 'cause you failed .
 I believe in my ideas .
 Good afternoon . Hello , hi .
 I represent Max 's Homemade Cupcakes .
 ( Gordon ) I 'm gonna stop you right there .
 Why Max 's cupcakes ?
 Why not Ellen 's or Pam 's ?
 Well , um ...
 Max was ...
 Max is this very special person and the inspiration behind our whole business .
 Got it .
 So Max is an emotional touchstone for you and your business .
 Yes . Valid .
 Go on .
 Great .
 So the logo ...
 George .
 This is our current company logo ,
 And I feel it works just fine .
 I mean , if it ain 't broke , don 't fix it , right ?
 Okay .
 Well , the cupcake shows a mix of sweet imagery because we 're two girls trying to retro- repurpose the phrase
 " sugar and spice and everything nice . " Hey , hey !
 Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey !
 Leave Pam alone !
 I 'm fine , Ellen .
 They can 't shut me down , because I believe in us and our special brand of artisan cupcakes .
 Why ?
 Give me !
 Eat it , you losers !
 Eat it , eat it !
 I see the truth balls have stopped .
 It looks like " eat it , eat it , you losers , " might just be your brand .
 You two are a combination of sugar and spice and things not so nice .
 Speaking of truth , I need you to pay Sandra for the seminar .
 As much as I admire your pluck , 12 trips to the pasta bar aren 't free .
 - Come on , Pam . - Yeah , let 's go , Ellen .
 I 'm Ellen .
 Guess what I have under my coat .
 Well , I know it 's not a boob reduction . What do you think ?
 Cool , huh ?
 Aw , man , somebody already makes that ?
 Oh , bummer .
 This is like when I thought I invented chip- wiches . Should 've known .
 I was eating one at the time .
 No , Max , this is your shirt .
 I got the rendering from the seminar and had it made that .
 We can make anything in under an hour .
 You know , that place under the bridge near the underage bar where you got under arrest .
 [ gasps ] No way . Oh , no way .
 That 's hot .
 I know , and a girl at the place asked me where she could get one .
 Really ?
 Kind of in love with myself right now .
 Hey , what made you change your mind about the T- shirts ?
 Well , one of the things I learned at Wharton is that success depends on staying open to a better idea , even if it 's not yours .
 - Aw .
 - And here .
 I thought you 'd rather a black one .
 On Tinder and in life .
