 MaiI caIl ! RacheI Greene , bunk seven .
 Thank you .
 Oh , cool ! A free sample of coffee .
 Oh , good , because where else would we get any ?
 Oh , right .

 Great . What is it ?
 Country club newsletter .
 My mother sends me the engagement notices for inspiration .
 Oh , my God !
 Oh , my God ! It 's Barry and Mindy !
 - Barry , who you almost -- ?
 - Barry , who I almost -- - And Mindy , your maid of -- - Mindy , my maid of --
 Let me see .
 That 's Mindy ?
 Wow ! She is pretty .
 Lucky . . .
 . . . to have had a friend Iike you .
 Marcel , bring me the rice . Come on , bring me the rice .
 Good boy . Give me the rice .
 Thank you .
 Good boy . He 's mastered the difference between " bring me the " . . . . . . and " pee in the . "
 " Bring me the " and -- Rach ?
 Oh , I 'm sorry . This is so stupid !
 I mean , I gave Barry up , right ?
 I should be happy for them .
 I am . I 'm happy for them .
 ReaIly ?
 I guess it would be different if I were with somebody .
 Whoa , what . . . . What happened to " Forget relationships !
 I 'm done with men " ?
 The whole penis embargo ?
 I don 't know .
 I guess it 's not about " no guys . "
 It 's about the " right guy , " you know ?
 With Barry . . . . . . it was safe and it was easy , but there was no heat .
 With Paolo , aII there was , was heat .
 And I mean , it was just this raw , animal , sexual --
 Right , right ! I got it . I was there .
 But do you think you can ever have both ?
 Someone that 's your best friend . . . . . . but then also can make your toes curl .
 Yes , I do .
 I reaIly do .
 In fact , it 's funny .
 Often , someone who you wouldn 't think could . . . . . . curI your toes . . . . . . might just be the one who -- -- gets interrupted .
 Hey , guys , how was the movie ?
 - Wonderful ! - It was so good !
 - Suck fest . - TotaI chick flick .
 I 'm sorry it wasn 't one of those movies with , Iike , guns and bombs . . . . . . and buses going reaIly fast !
 I don 't need violence to enjoy a movie . . . . . . as Iong as there 's a Iittle nudity .
 There was nudity .
 I meant female nudity .
 I don 't need to see Lou Grant frolicking .
 Hugh ! Hugh Grant !
 AII right , I 've got to go .
 Come on , Marcel . Come on !
 We 're gonna go take a bath .
 Yes , we are , aren 't we ? They 're stiII just friends , right ?
 And I wiII see you tomorrow .
 Right . You 're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel 's .
 Hang on . Does Aunt Monica get a say in this ?
 Please , Aunt Monica , please ?
 Oh , unclench . You won 't even be here .
 I can 't believe we 're having this discussion .
 I agree .
 I 'm , Iike , in disbelief . If it was gonna happen with Rachel . . . . . . wouldn 't it have happened already ?

 She said she 's Iooking for a relationship . . . . . . with someone exactly Iike me .
 She said that ?
 WeIl , I added the " exactly Iike me " part .
 But she said she 's Iooking for someone .
 And someone wiII be there tonight . " Tonight " tonight ?
 It 's perfect .
 It 'II just be the two of us .
 She spent aII day taking care of my monkey .
 I can 't remember the Iast time a girI took care of my monkey .
 Anyway , I figured after work , I 'd go pick up a bottle of wine . . . . . . go over there and try to woo her .
 You know what you should do ?
 Take her back to the 1 890s when that phrase was Iast used .
 If you keep this up ... ... you 'll be finished by the weekend .
 Now , the one in the feathered boa , that 's Dr. Francis .
 Now , she used to be a man .
 Look . See , there 's Raven .
 We hate her .
 We 're glad she 's dying .
 And then -- What ?
 Marcel ! Are you playing with Monica 's shoes ?
 You 're not supposed to --
 Marcel , did you poo in the shoe ?
 Oh , Marcel ! Bad monkey ! Oh , God !
 Sorry , Barry . A Iittle engagement gift .
 I 'm sure you didn 't register for that .
 Who died ? Who died ?
 RoII him over !
 Come on , roII him over ! WeIl , we know it wasn 't Dexter , right , Marcel ? Because --
 Marcel ?
 - How could you Iose him ? - I don 't know !
 We were watching TV , then he pooped in Monica 's shoe . . . .
 Wait . He pooped in my shoe ?
 Which one ? I don 't know . The Ieft one !
 Which ones ?
 Those Iittle clunky Amish things you think go with everything .
 Why is the air in here so negative ?
 RacheI Iost Marcel .
 Oh , no ! How ?
 - He pooped in my shoe .
 - Which one ? Those cute black ones I wear aII the time .
 No , which one ? The right or Ieft ?
 Because the Ieft one is Iucky .
 Come on ! What am I gonna do ? AII right .
 You 're a monkey . . . . . . you 're Ioose in the city .
 Where do you go ?
 It 's his first time out , so he 'II do some of the touristy things .
 I 'II go to Cats .
 You go to the Russian Tea Room .
 Oh , my God !
 Come on , you guys ! He 'II be home any minute . He 'II kiII me !
 Search the building .
 You take the first and second floor .
 We 'II take third and fourth .
 What am I gonna do ?
 You stay here and just wait by the phone .
 Spray LysoI in my shoe and wait for Ross to kiII you .
 Does anybody want to trade ?
 What do you want ?
 Mr. Heckles , our friend Iost a monkey .
 Have you seen it ?
 I Ieft a Belgian waffle out here .
 Did you take it ?
 Why 'd you Ieave it in the haIl ?
 I wasn 't ready for it .
 The monkey , have you seen a monkey ?
 I saw Regis Philbin once .
 Thank you , Mr. Heckles .
 You owe me a waffle .
 He 's a black capuchin monkey with a white face . . . . . . with Russian dressing and pickles on the side .
 Thanks .
 How did it go today ? Oh , great !
 It went great . ReaIly great .
 Is that wine ?
 You want some ? Oh , I would love some .
 But you know what ? Let 's not drink it here .
 I feeI crazy .
 Do you want to go to Newark ?

 But before we go to the murder capitaI of the Northeast . . . . . . I kind of wanted to run something by you . We could .


 You know how we were talking before . . . . . . about relationships and stuff . . . .
 - Oh , God , Ross , I cannot do this !
 - Okay , quick and painful .
 Oh , God ! Okay , aII right . AII right , okay .
 Please don 't hate me .
 What ? What ? You know Marcel ?

 I kind of Iost him .
 I can 't believe this .
 AII I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment !
 I know . I 'm sorry .
 I guess it 's partiaIly my fault .
 I shouldn 't have asked you to start off with a monkey .
 I should have started you off with a pencil .
 I 'm doing everything I can .
 I 've got everybody Iooking for him and I got --
 - Who is it ? - Animal Control .
 - I 've even got AnimaI Control .
 - You caIled AnimaI Control ?
 Why ? Do you not Iike them ?
 MarceI is an iIlegaI exotic animal .
 I 'm not aIlowed to have him .
 If they find him , they 'II take him away from me .
 WeIl , now , see , you never ever told us that .
 Because I never expected you to invite them to the apartment !
 Hi ! Thanks for coming .
 Somebody caIled about a monkey ?
 You know what ? That was a complete misunderstanding .
 We thought we had a monkey , but we didn 't .
 - It turned out it was a hat .
 - Cat !
 We checked the third floor .
 No one 's seen Marcel . My uncle Marcel .
 Is that who the monkey 's named after ?
 Possession of an iIlegaI exotic is punishable . . . . . . by two years in prison and confiscation of the animal .
 Oh , my God ! You 'd put that poor Iittle creature in jail ?
 Remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first ?
 Yes , but there isn 't always time .
 I 'm sure there 's some friendly way to reconcile this .
 Have a seat .
 We haven 't been introduced . I 'm Monica GeIler .
 Oh , my God , you are !
 And you 're RacheI Greene !
 Luisa Gianetti ! Lincoln High ?
 I sat behind you guys in homeroom .
 Luisa ! Oh , my God !
 Monica ! It 's Luisa !
 Luisa ! From homeroom !
 You have no idea who I am , do you ?
 Not at aIl .
 WeIl , maybe that 's because you spent four years ignoring me .
 Would it have been so hard to say , " Morning , Luisa " . . . . . . or " Nice overaIls " ?
 Oh , I 'm so sorry ! It 's not so much you .
 You were fat . You had your own problems .
 But you . What a bitch !
 What ?
 You know what ?
 Be that as it may .
 Could you help us out here on that monkey thing for old times ' sake ? Go , Bobcats !
 I could .
 But I won 't . If I find that monkey , he 's mine .
 Sorry .
 Marcel ? Marcel ?
 Hi , can I help you ?
 We 're kind of having an emergency , and we were Iooking for something .
 - A monkey .
 - Yes , have you seen any ?
 No , I haven 't seen a monkey .
 Can you fix radiators ?
 Sure ! Did you try turning the knob back the other way ?
 Of course ! Oh . Then , no .
 Taste this daiquiri . Is there too much rum ?
 Just a second .
 Hope you find your monkey .
 Oh , no , wait !
 We may not know about radiators , per se . . . . . . but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu .
 Weren 't we in the middle of something ?
 But these women are very hot and they need our help .
 And they 're very hot !
 We can 't , aII right ?
 We 're sorry . You have no idea how sorry .
 But we promised to find this monkey .
 He 's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel .
 So if we could get pictures of you , it 'd help us out .
 From now on , you don 't get to talk to other people .


 - Oh , my God ! - What ? !
 Something just brushed up against my right Ieg .
 Oh , it 's okay . It was just my Ieft Ieg .
 Look , Phoebe !
 Oh , Marcel !
 Come here ! Step aside , Iadies .
 - What are you gonna do ?
 - Just a smaII tranquilizer .
 Run , Marcel ! Run , Marcel !
 Damn !
 Are you okay ?
 I think so .
 Oh , gosh !
 We 've been aII over the neighborhood !
 He 's gone ! He 's just gone !
 - You don 't know that .
 - Come on ! It 's cold , it 's dark .
 He doesn 't know the ViIlage !
 And now I have a broken foot .
 Oh , my --
 I have no monkey and a broken foot . Thank you very much !
 I 've said I 'm sorry , Iike , a miIlion times .
 What do you want me to do ?
 You want me to break my foot too ?
 Here , I 'II break my foot right now . Oh , my God ! There , are you happy now ?
 Yeah , now that you kicked the sign . . . . . . I don 't miss MarceI anymore !
 It 's not Iike I did this on purpose .
 No , this is just vintage Rachel .
 Things just sort of happen around you !
 You 're off in " RacheI Land , " doing your " RacheI Thing " . . . . . . oblivious to people 's monkeys or to people 's feelings and --
 I don 't even want to hear it !
 Forget it , okay ?
 What ? What ?
 Hey , banana man !
 Oh , this is so intense !
 One side of my butt is totaIly asleep and the other side has no idea .
 Hi ! Did you order some bananas ?
 - What about it ?
 - Give me my monkey back ! I don 't have a monkey .
 - Then what 's with aII the bananas ? - Potassium .
 Okay , where is he ?
 Where is he ?

 What have you done to him ?
 That 's my monkey . That 's Patty the monkey .
 Are you insane ?
 Come here , Marcel .
 Come here , Patty .
 Come here , Marcel . Come here , Patty . Here , monkey .
 Here , monkey .
 Gotcha !
 - Give me my monkey back ! - That 's my monkey .
 Take this up with the judge .
 That 's not my monkey .
 Just the dress is mine . You can send it back whenever .
 AII right , I want my monkey !
 Oh , come on , Luisa . Sorry , prom queen .
 You had to be a bitch in school , you couldn 't have been fat .
 In high school , I was the prom queen . . . . . . and the homecoming queen and the class president and you . . . . . . were also there .
 If you take this monkey , I 'II Iose . . . . . . one of the most important people in my Iife .
 You can hate me if you want , but please do not punish him .
 Luisa , you have a chance to be the bigger person here .
 Take it !

 Then I 'II caII your supervisor and teII her . . . . . . you shot my friend in the ass with a dart !
 It 'II be nice to get this off , won 't it ?
 Or we can Ieave it on for now .
 That 's fine .
 With the right pair of pumps , that would be a great Iittle outfit .
 Listen . . . . I 'm sorry I was so hard on you before --
 No , come on . It was my fault .
 I almost Iost your -- But you got him back .
 You were great .
 We stiII have that bottle of wine .
 Are you in the mood for . . . . . . something grape ?
 - Sure , that would be good .
 - AII right .
 The neighbors must be vacuuming .
 WeIl , as Iong as we 're . . . . . . here . . . . . . and not on the subject . . . .
 I was thinking about . . . . . . how mad we got at each other before .
 And I was thinking maybe it was partiaIly because of how we --
 - Rachel ? - Barry ?
 I can 't .
 I can 't do it . I can 't marry Mindy .
 I 'm stiII in love with you .
 We have got to start Iocking that door !
 This is me in The Sound of Music .
 You see the von Trapp kids ?
 Because I 'm in front of them .
 I thought that was an alp .
 High schooI was not my favorite time .
 I don 't know . I loved high school .
 It was just Iike four years of parties and dating and sex and --
 WeIl , I went to boarding schooI with 400 boys .
 Any sex I had would 've involved a major Iifestyle choice .
 Doesn 't it seem Iike a miIlion years ago ?
 My butt cheek is waking up !
