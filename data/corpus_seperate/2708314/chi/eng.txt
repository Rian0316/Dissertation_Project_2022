 00 : 00 : 01, 807 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 008 Look , I know you guys don 't want to do this , but we have no choice . So , you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with . I got " whine . "
 I got the " b word . "
 Yeah , well , it 's in our contract to serve on a university committee . And frankly , this is one I believe in .
 Okay , here we go .
 Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences .
 Come on , if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff ,
 I wouldn 't have spent so much of my 20s in the shower .
 If you ask me , this whole thing is a waste of our time . Helping women ?
 Yeah , helping anyone .
 People should take care of themselves .
 Oh , like yesterday , when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners , the pharmacy and the post office ?
 I 'm not saying people can 't use tools .
 Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam .
 You don 't think it 's worthwhile to try to get more women working in science . I think that 's incredibly sexist of you .
 I believe in a gender- blind society
 like in where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals .
 You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive , but a black lady still answered the space phone ?
 Oh , I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura .

 Howard 's disturbing recollections aside , I don 't appreciate being forced to do banal committee work . Yes , I know , you 're too smart for this .
 Exactly .
 It 's like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito .
 Got it .
 All right , I 'm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer- review process , is for papers to be submitted under gender- neutral names .
 Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith .
 I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials , so as not to be pre- judged .
 J. K. Rowling , uh , D. C. Fontana .
 Van Nuys pole- dancer D. D. Melons .

 All right , I think we 've really helped women today . Let 's fire up the old Xbox .
 Guys , please don 't make this a school project where I 'm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch .
 No , we 're not .
 This time you 're the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch .
 So , you think I 'm one of the smarter kids ? No , you 're a tool I was using to make my point .

 Guys , our topic is " Encouraging Women in Science . "
 Can you at least play a less sexist game
 How is it sexist ?
 My character wields a battle axe as well as any man . Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30 .
 And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins .
 Mother , warrior- princess , franchise owner --
 I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town .
 Sheldon , you 're always saying how much smarter you are than me .
 Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science . All your ideas address the issue at a university level .

 By then it 's too late .
 You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences .
 That 's actually good .
 Why didn 't I think of that ?
 Some people are otters , some people are rocks .
 I wonder if there 's a way we could give the idea a trial run .
 Maybe I could call my old middle school , see if we can talk to some of the female students .
 That 's great -- try to set up something for the three of us to go over there .
 Oh , hold on . While I 'm comfortable speaking about science ,
 I 'm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren .
 Better Google it .
 What exactly are you looking up ? " How do I get 12- year- old girls excited . "

 No !
 No !
 Thanks again for letting me crash " girls ' night . "
 Are you kidding ? You brought fancy wine and made fondue .
 I 've slept with guys for less .

 It 's a joke .
 Based on real events . Anyway , I was hoping I could , uh , pick your brains a little .
 I 'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date .
 Well , evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady in the face of danger , so I recommend an unsafe environment .
 Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks ... picnic near a lunatic asylum ... a wine tasting on Skid Row .
 Eh , Lucy has some , uh , social anxiety issues .
 Maybe we could start with something simpler .
 Why don 't you take her to Disneyland ?
 You go on Space Mountain , you 're in the dark , she 's holding onto you .
 Yeah , but you just have to remember , that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end , so make sure you got your clothes back on .
 It 's a joke .
 Based on real events .
 Mm , Disneyland ? I don 't know . With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around , just reminds me too much of India .

 I haven 't been to Disneyland since I was a kid .
 We should definitely go one weekend .
 Weekends are too crowded .
 So , blow off work , go on a weekday .
 Hooky ?
 I 've never played hooky in my life .
 My mom said that 's how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music . It 's more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34- year- old guy named Luther .

 Joke ?
 I can laugh about it now .

 So , what do you say ?
 This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland ?
 I 'm in .
 Me , too . KOOTHRAPPALl : Excuse me ,
 I thought we were trying to solve my problem ?
 Oh , yeah , right .
 Wait , what was your problem again ?
 I am a man who can 't talk to women , trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can 't be around other people .
 Yeah , that 's a toughie .
 Let 's think .
 Hmm .
 We doing just Disney or California Adventure , too ?
 It 's nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students .
 Well , they 're actually pretty excited .
 I 'm their most famous alum . ( chuckles )
 If you don 't count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes .
 This must feel pretty good for you , coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut .
 Yeah , last time I was here , I was just a scrawny little nerd .
 And now you 're also an astronaut .
 So many memories . I mean , how many times in these hallways was I tripped , punched and spit on ?

 Oh , look , here 's my old locker .
 I have a masters in engineering and I still can 't figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there .
 Hey . What ?
 Nothing .
 ( chuckling )
 Smart . We don 't want any problems .
 I can 't believe I ditched work for Disneyland .
 What did you tell your boss ?
 Oh , I was very clever , I did it in stages . At 7 : 00 last night ,
 I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood . At 9 : 30 ,
 I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird . At 11 : 30 , I called and said
 I was throwing up like a fire hose . At 12 : 45 , I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds , and now I 'm going to Disneyland .

 Penny , what did you say ?
 I work at the Cheesecake Factory ,
 I said " bye . "
 So , what are we gonna do first ?
 I don 't know about you guys , but I 'm gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover .
 Ooh , that sounds like fun .
 You 're kidding , right ?
 We 're not just gonna get drunk and go on rides ?
 Come on , do it with us .
 ( sighs ) All right , whatever . How does it work ? Okay , so , you pick your princess --
 Sleeping Beauty , Snow White Cinderella -- they give you hair , makeup , the works .
 Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella .
 Oh , I want to be Cinderella , too . Yeah . ( Amy chuckling )
 We can 't all be Cinderella .

 Then how do we decide ?
 Well , it 's simple .
 This was my idea .
 I 'm driving . I 'm Cinderella .
 You bitches got a problem with that , we could stop the car right now .
 ( whispering ) :
 Excuse me , I 'm meeting a girl here .
 It 's kind of our first date . ( whispering ) :
 In a library ? She and I are both a little awkward in social situations , so this seemed like a good idea .
 People say I 'm a little awkward , too .
 May I join you ?
 No , you can 't join us .
 Just go- go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from .

 You can do better .
 Oh , we 're eating here ?
 We 're having a texting date ?

 KOOTHRAPPALl :

 Okay , who 's ready for some science ?
 Me , too .
 Okay , I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter .
 I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real- life astronaut Howard Wolowitz , and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be .
 How cool , you ask ? Well , how about negative 273 degrees ,
 ' cause that 's the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value .
 Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it ?
 What ?

 All right ! So now let 's bring out theoretical physicist
 Dr. Sheldon Cooper .

 Hello , female children . Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist .
 Polish- born , French- educated Madame Curie .
 Codiscoverer of radioactivity , she was a hero of science ... until her hair fell out ; her vomit and stool became filled with blood ... and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery .
 With a little hard work ,
 I see no reason why that can 't happen to any of you .
 Are we done ?
 Can we go ?

 The thing to remember is you can go to outer space , too .
 I mean , look at me . I went to this very school .
 Those desks you 're sitting in ,
 I was once superglued to one of them .
 Did you go to the moon ?
 No , but I did go to the International Space Station .
 Did you fly the rocket ?
 No , but I was in the rocket .
 I didn 't actually ...
 So you just flew around ?
 That 's kind of like my uncle .
 He 's a flight attendant .

 No ... ( chuckles ) I 'm an American hero .
 Your uncle brings people nuts , okay ?
 Boy , we are learning a lot here , huh ? Thank you , astronaut Howard . ( clears throat )
 Um , I am what 's called an experimental physicist , which is super- fun , because I get to test theories and work with lasers .
 Yes ?
 How did you decide to become a scientist ?
 Uh , excellent question . Um , I suppose I 've always been into science , you know ...
 My mother and father are scientists , so I was kind of led in that direction .
 Eh , pushed might be a better way to describe it .
 To be honest with you guys , when I was your age ,
 I wanted to be a rap star .
 Like Snoop Dogg , but with a healthy respect for the police .

 Yeah , no , sure , you laugh . Just like my mother did .
 After I confided , I was derided and chided , my moms and I collided .
 She said my dreams were misguided .

 That 's just a little freestyle .

 I never wanted to play the cello .
 How do you meet girls playing the cello ?
 " Hey , you want to come over to my house
 " and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee ? "
 Quick , pull the fire alarm .
 Let 's get out of here . Uh , hello again .
 Um , yeah , I don 't know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences , but it 's clear you young women here , today , have been .
 While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time , it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science , and , uh , I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now .


 Uh , Dr. Rostenkowski , Dr. Fowler , are you there ? AMY : We 're here .
 Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women .
 It 's our pleasure .
 I 'm Dr. Fowler , and I 'm a neuroscientist .
 And I 'm Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz , and I 'm a microbiologist .
 The world of science needs more women , but from a young age , we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds .
 That 's true .
 Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be .
 Unless you want to be Cinderella .
 Come at me .
 See what happens .
 KOOTHRAPALl :
 My battery 's dying , so I 'm just gonna talk .
 Thanks for today .
 I 've been trying to do more things that scare me , and coming here was definitely one of them .
 But it was also really nice .
 So thanks , and , um ,
 I 'm gonna go . Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good- bye ?

 You know , if that 's okay .
 Okay .
 Panic attack !
 Maybe next time .
 I 'm counting that as foreplay .



 Bernie ,
 I 'm home .
 You have fun today ?
 Yes , and I have a surprise for you .
 Please be Cinderella .
 Please be Cinderella .
 Well , hello , Prince Charming .
 Milady .


 ( knocking on door , door opens )
 Hey , how was your ... what ?
 I can explain .
 I played hooky with the girls , then we all went to Disneyland and got ... What are you doing ? Disneyland .
 Go on , I 'm listening .
 Sheldon , all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up .
 Heard you the first time .
