 - TeII him !
 - Please teII him !
 Shut up ! TeII me what ?
 You won 't even Iook at him .
 Come on .
 I could use another reason why women won 't Iook at me .
 AII right .
 Last night , I had a dream . . . . . . that you and I. . . . . . were . . . .
 Doing it on this table .
 ExceIlent dream score .
 Why would you dream that ?
 More importantly . . . . . . was I any good ?
 WeIl , you were pretty damn good .
 Interesting .
 In my dreams , I 'm surprisingly inadequate .
 Last night , you seemed to know your way around the table .
 I love it when we share .
 You okay ?
 I can 't believe you two had sex in her dream !
 I 'm sorry . It was a one- time thing .
 I was very drunk , and it was someone else 's subconscious .

 HeIlo , Rachel .
 Get off !
 Oh , give me !
 Can you see me operating a driII press ?
 I don 't know . What are you wearing ?
 Why would you want to operate a driII press ?
 For some short- term work .
 TiII I get back some of my massage clients .
 Pirates again ?
 No . Nothing Iike that .
 I 'm just such a dummy .
 I taught a " Massage Yourself at Home " workshop .
 And they are .
 Hey , Chan , she could work for you .
 Thanks , Joey . That 's a good idea .
 I could ! I could do it ! What is it ?
 My secretary 's gonna be out .
 She 's having one of her boobs reduced .
 It 's a whole big boob story .
 I could be a secretary .
 I don 't know if it 's your kind of thing . . . . . . because it involves a Iot of being normal . . . . . . for a Iarge portion of the day .
 I could do that .
 - What 're you playing with ?
 - My new beeper .
 Why does a paleontologist need a beeper ?
 Is it for dinosaur emergencies ?
 Help ! They 're stiII extinct !
 It 's for when CaroI goes into Iabor .
 She can get me wherever I am .
 AII she has to do is diaI 55- JlMBO .
 A cooI number and a possible name for the kid .
 See you Iater .
 Off to see young Ethan ? Thank you .
 How young is young Ethan ?
 Young ?
 He 's our age .
 When we were . . . .
 He 's a senior in coIlege . CoIlege ?
 This man- child has no problem with how old you are ?
 No , of course not . It 's not even an issue . . . . . . because I told him I was 22 .
 - You what ?
 - What ?
 Oh , I can 't pass for 22 ?
 WeIl , maybe 25 , 26 .
 I am 26 . There you go .
 Can you hear that ?

 That 'II stop when you pick up the phone .
 Oh , I 'm on !
 Mr. Bing 's office .
 I 'm sorry he 's in a meeting right now .
 I 'm not in a meeting .
 WiII he know what this is in reference to ?
 And he has your number ?
 I 'II see that he gets the message . Bye- bye !
 Ross says hi .
 This is so fun !
 What do we do now ?
 WeIl , now I actuaIly have to get to work . " Most Iikely . "
 Okay , I 'm gonna be out there . AII right .
 Bye- bye . Bye- bye .
 Yes ? What you doing ?
 Okay , windows are clean . Candles are Iit .
 Belt 's too tight . Gotta change the belt .
 Did I turn the fish ? Nope , because I made Iasagna .
 Am I out of control ?
 Just a touch .
 Mon , I don 't understand .
 You 've been dating this guy since . . . . . . his midterms .
 Why , aII of the sudden , are you so . . . ?
 What ?
 Could tonight be the night ?
 I don 't know .
 He 's a great guy . . . . . . and I love being with him .
 But , you know . . . . . . things happen when they happen .
 You don 't plan these things .
 So did you shave your Iegs ?

 Would you Iet it go , Ross ?
 It was just a dream . It doesn 't mean --
 This is it ! It 's baby time . Baby time !
 AII right , relax , just relax . Be cool .
 Yeah , hi . I was just beeped .
 No , Andre is not here .
 Third time today .
 Yes , I am sure .
 I do not perform those kind of services .
 Services ?
 Oh , services .
 Yeah , you want 55- JUMBO .
 That 's right .
 That 's right . JUMBO with a " U , " sir .
 No , you don 't want me .
 Judging by his number , I 'd be a huge disappointment .
 Alrighty , bye- bye .
 How was the first day ?
 ExceIlent ! Everyone was so , so nice !
 It pays to know the man who wears my shoes . Me .

 - I didn 't teII anyone I knew you .
 - Why not ?
 WeIl , because , you know . They don 't Iike you .
 What ?
 I thought you knew .

 Who doesn 't Iike me ?
 Everyone . Except for . . . . No .
 Everyone .
 What are you talking about ? Don 't feeI bad .
 You know , they used to Iike you a Iot .
 But you got promoted , and now you 're . . . . . . Mr. Boss Man .
 You know , Mr. Big . Mr. Bing . Boss Man Bing .
 I can 't believe it . Yeah .
 They even do you .
 They " do " me ?
 You know , Iike , okay . " Could that report be any Iater ? "
 I don 't sound Iike that .
 Yeah , you do .
 " The hiIls are alive with the sound . . . . . . of music . "
 " My scone ! My scone ! "
 I don 't sound Iike that .
 That is so not true .
 That is so not -- That is so not -- That -- Oh , shut up !
 - Did not !
 - I 'm teIling you , up untiI I was 9 . . . . . . I thought gunpoint was a place where crimes happened .
 How 's that possible ?
 It 's always on the news .
 " A man is being held up at Gunpoint . "
 " Tourists are terrorized at Gunpoint . "
 And I kept thinking , why do people continue to go there ?
 I should go .
 - Unless -- - What ?
 Unless you wanna stay over . I mean , I 'm going to . So . . . .
 Yeah , I 'd reaIly Iike that .
 Before we get into any staying- over stuff . . . . . . there 's something you should know .
 Is this , Iike , " I have an early class tomorrow " . . . . . . or " I 'm secretly married to a goat " ?
 WeIl , it 's somewhere in between .
 You see , in a strictly technicaI sense , of course , I 'm not . . . .
 WeIl , I mean , I haven 't ever . . . .
 Ethan ? Are you a virgin ?
 WeIl , if that 's what you kids are caIling it these days , then . . . . . . yes , I am .
 I am . I 've kind of been waiting for the right person .
 ReaIly ?
 You do know I was talking about you , right ?
 Wow !
 You keep saying that . You know , you read about it .
 You see it in the movies .
 Even when you practice it at home , man , oh , man . . . . . . it is nothing Iike that .
 Listen , Iisten . You told me something that was reaIly difficult for you .
 And I figure if you can be honest , then I can too .
 Don 't teII me I did it wrong .
 Nothing wrong about that .
 Here goes .
 I 'm not 22 .
 I 'm 25 . . .
 . . . and 1 3 months .
 But I figure that shouldn 't change anything .
 What does it matter how old we are ?
 Listen . . . . . . as Iong as we 're teIling stuff . . . . . . I have another one for you .
 I 'm a Iittle younger than I said .
 You 're not a senior ?
 Oh , I 'm a senior . . .
 . . . in high school .
 What we did was wrong .
 I just had sex with someone who wasn 't alive during the bicentennial !
 I just had sex .
 Ethan , focus .
 How could you not teII me ? You never told me your age .
 That 's different ! My Iie didn 't make one of us a felon in 48 states !
 - What were you thinking ?
 - I was too busy faIling --
 Don 't say it !
 In love with you .
 ReaIly ?
 Sorry .
 WeIl , faII out of it . You shouldn 't be here .
 It 's a schooI night !
 Oh , God ! I 'm Iike those women that you see . . . . . . with shiny guys named Chad .
 I 'm Joan CoIlins .
 Who ?
 Andre should be there in about 45 minutes .
 Alrighty .
 Bye- bye .
 It 's just easier that way .
 You told me about the Iast dream .
 No . Forget it . Why not ?
 Was I doing something particularly saucy ?
 AII right .
 Fine . You were not the only one there .
 Joey was too .
 AII right .
 Was there . . . . . . anybody else there ?
 No .
 You sure ? Nobody . . . . . . handing out mints or anything ?
 No , just the three of us .
 So was it you and Chandler . . . . . . then you and me or you , me and Chandler ?
 - You know what ? - What ?
 There were times . . . . . . when it wasn 't even me .
 That is so sweet , you guys !
 Mon , Ethan caIled again .

 What ?
 Ethan caIled again .
 You 're not seeing him anymore ?
 No . Sometimes , just things don 't work out .
 This has nothing to do with him needing a note to get out of gym ?
 I didn 't say any -- I did not say anything . I swear .
 He stopped by .
 Next time you talk to him . . . . . . could you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is ?
 Oh , my Iife is just so amusing .
 Can we drop it now ?
 Sorry .
 " It 's morphin time ! "
 - Stegosaurus ! - Tyrannosaurus !
 I gotta go .
 Head rush .
 One more , and then I have to go .
 Cool .
 Where you going ?
 A birthday party with some work people .
 Work people ?
 Nobody told me . No , I know .
 That 's part of the whole . . . . . . them- not- Iiking- you extravaganza .
 I don 't get it . A month ago , these people were my friends .
 Just because I 'm in charge , I 'm not a different person .
 Then come , hang out .
 Let them see what a great guy you stiII are .
 - You think I should ? - I reaIly do .
 But could we not go together ?
 I don 't wanna be the geek who invited the boss .
 Last night was great .
 You know , the karaoke thing ? Tracy and I doing " Ebony and Ivory . "
 You were great !
 But they stiII made fun of you .
 What ?
 Now you 're Mr. Caring Boss .
 Mr. I 'm- one- of- you Boss .
 Mr. I- wanna- be- your- buddy . Boss Man Bing !
 Then I don 't get it .
 WeIl , you know what , Chandler ? I think you just gotta face it .
 You 're , Iike , the guy in the big office .
 You 're the one that hires them and fires them .
 They say you 're a great boss .
 They do ?
 But they 're not your friends anymore .
 - I just want -- - But you can 't .
 But I just want --
 Are you gonna --
 CaroI and I have a new system .
 If she punches in 9- 1 - 1 . . . . . . it means she 's having a baby .
 Otherwise , I just ignore it .
 What about Andre ?
 He got a caII from what I think was our cousin , Nathan .
 Frankly , it was a Iittle more than I needed to know .
 That was gonna be my opener .
 Did you guys check out those new hand dryers in the bathroom ?
 - I thought that was just a rumor .
 - True story .
 Look , I gotta teII you something .
 I 'm not 1 7 .
 I said that so you 'd think I was cute and vulnerable .
 I 'm actuaIly 30 .
 I have a wife .
 I have a job . I 'm your congressman .
 This is ridiculous .
 We are great together !
 We can talk . We make each other Iaugh .
 And the sex . Oh , man ! I have no frame of reference , but I thought that was great !
 - It was .
 - What 's the problem ?
 Ethan , it 's . . . . It 's icky .
 " Icky " ?
 You 're actuaIly gonna throw this away because it 's icky ?
 This isn 't easy for me either .
 I wish things were different .
 If you were older or I was younger . . . . . . or we Iived in biblicaI times . . . . . . I could reaIly --
 No , don 't say it . Love you .
 - Are your hands stiII wet ?
 - They 're moist . Let 's dry them again .
 Or , Iike , " Could these margaritas be any stronger ? "
 Hey , Chandler .
 HeIlo , Mr. Bing .
 Loved your Stevie Wonder Iast night .

 Thanks .
 About the weekly numbers . . . . . . I 'm gonna need them on my desk by 9 : 00 .
 - Sure . - No problem .
 You have to give them something .
