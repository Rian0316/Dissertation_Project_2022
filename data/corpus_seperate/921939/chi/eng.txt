 I would love her like she is my own !
 I just can 't believe that Orson could do such a thing .
 His wife goes missing and his mistress turns up dead ?

 Oh , thank God ! -
 I am not playing with a woman that is willing to let Mike take the fall for her psycho husband .

 I 'll hire the best lawyer in town , on one condition -- you can 't see him anymore .

 Hello , Alma .







 Mama loves her baby .
 Does the baby love mama ?


 If you don 't get back in your cage right now ,
 I 'm gonna have to leave you behind . Please !
 Going somewhere ?
 I 'm staying at a motel tonight .
 Why ?
 I don 't have time to discuss it . I 'm late for the bus .
 All right .
 I 'm going away because ...
 I know you 're having an affair .
 Ah . I see .
 Aren 't you even gonna deny it ?
 On the contrary . I wanna shout it from the rooftops !
 For the first time in my life , I 'm actually in love .
 How can you say that to me ? I 'm your wife !
 We both know why we got married , and it had nothing to do with affection .
 So you don 't care if I go ?
 No .
 Wait !
 This isn 't what 's supposed to happen ! You should be begging me to stay with you .
 I deserve to be happy , Alma . So do you .
 And we 're clearly not gonna find that together .
 Orson , no !

 Bree Hodge ? I 'm Alma Hodge .
 I believe we have someone in common .




 Bree let her son move back in .
 You 're kidding . When ? Yesterday .
 I 'm so disappointed in her . well , the police did arrest Mike .
 I mean , I know you think he 's innocent , but surely you can understand why Bree 's feelings have changed .
 Well , mine haven 't , and I know something that Bree probably doesn 't .
 When Orson was 17 , he spent time in a mental institution .
 How did you find that out ?
 I snuck into his office and rifled through his things .
 Of course you did .
 But that doesn 't prove he had anything to do with Monique 's murder .
 No , but it 's a piece of the puzzle .

 And when you combine that with the fact that his first fe went missing ...
 So you 're Alma .
 Where have you been all this time ?
 In Canada . My aunt lives there .
 Well , you should 've told someone . People thought you were dead .
 Some even thought that Orson killed you .
 Well , that 's sort of what I wanted them to think .
 That 's why I left my bird behind and only took cash , so they couldn 't trace me through my credit cards .
 So you deliberately framed Orson ?
 I 'm not saying it was my finest hour .
 But you have to understand , Orson hurt me very badly .
 He cheated on me .
 Yes , I know -- with Monique polier .
 And I thought , if I disappeared , she 'd get scared and leave him , like he left me .
 Isn 't jealousy awful ?
 So why have you come back ?
 I found this fantastic therapist .
 He told me that by holding on to my anger
 I was really just hurting myself , which was hard to deny .
 I mean , hello , I 'm here in Winnipeg with a deaf aunt and no credit .
 So I thought , it 's time to make amends .
 Darling ?
 Mrs McLean canceled , so ...
 I 'm free for lunch .
 Um , actually , we have a guest .
 Hello , Orson .
 Oh , hello ...
 So ... what is it with you and redheads ?

 I- I hope you don 't mind me springing this picnic on you .
 I figured it 'd be more fun than some stuffy restaurant .
 Are you kidding ?
 What could be more romantic ?
 Back off , you son of a bitch !
 more wine ?
 Yes , keep it coming .
 Hello ?
 Hey , who 's the dork ?
 Carlos ? What 's with that cap ?
 " Extra ! Extra ! Read all about it ! "
 Where the hell are you ?
 What are you doing at Mike 's house ?
 - I live here .
 What do you mean you live there ? Since when ?
 Gaby , my car 's been in the driveway for three weeks . Even you can 't be that self- absorbed .
 Well , as you can see , I have more pleasant thing to focus on .
 So when you gonna tell Jimmy Olsen there that you hate picnics ?
 I 'm gonna hang up now .
 So where were we ?
 Your ex- husband moved in across the street ?
 What 's that gonna be like ?
 Yeah ? ! Are you gonna kiss him ?
 That 's right , Carlos . we had some problems with raccoons getting into the trash . so why don 't you just put a lid on it ?
 okay , they 're here . Now listen , stand up .
 Kayla has been through a lot , so when she walks in the door ,
 I want you to make her feel welcome , okay ? Give her a hug and be really nice .
 I 'm giving her my room . How much nicer do I have to be ?
 Well , nicer than that , or she 's gonna get alyour toys , too .
 Hey , hey , hey ! Hi !
 Look who I found wandering around the airport .
 Oh ! Hi , Kayla ! We missed you !
 We 're so glad you 're here .

 Okay , boys .
 Good . Yeah , okay . So give her some room .
 Hey , wow , look , are those presents for Kayla ?
 Yes , they are .
 Hey , look at that . Preston gave you a harmonica . Isn 't that cool ?
 Oh . " Harriet the spy . " Sounds mysterious .
 Thanks .
 And what did you get for Porter ?
 A video game , but I get to play it whenever I want .
 Porter !
 I -- you know what ? I got you something , too .
 This ... is Nellie .
 My grandma gave her to me when I was little , and I was hoping you could take care of her for me .
 Thanks .
 Hey , honey , why don 't you take your stuff and go upstairs and , uh , get ready for lunch , okay ?
 And I 'll make some chili .
 Okay , daddy .
 Honey ... that was so sweet ... to give her your doll .
 Oh .
 She didn 't seem that knocked out by it .
 Well , just give her some time .
 She 'll -- she 'll come around . It 's a tough adjustment .
 Okay .
 I must say , Bree , I don 't know when I 've tasted such moist pound cake .
 Sour cream .
 Ah .
 So whatever happened to my parrot ?
 I set it free .
 Mmm !
 Orson , they don 't fair well in the wild .
 You should 've -- - For God 's sake , Alma , who cares about the damn bird ?
 You set me up .
 Why don 't I wrap up a piece of this pound cake for you to enjoy later ?
 Do you have any idea what you put me through ? You almost ruined my life .
 You 've rebounded nicely . Bree 's lovely .
 Don 't change the subject .
 You put me through a lot , too , Orson , but I forgave you .
 Can 't we just put this behind us ?
 And that 's all you 've come back for -- closure ?
 Of course .
 What else ?
 I 'm out of lipstick . Can I borrow yours ?
 Sure .
 Cherry berry ?
 - Austin likes the way it tastes .
 Oh , I did not need to know that .
 So , um , where you going ?
 Down to the jailhouse to talk to Mike .
 But didn 't you tell Ian you wouldn 't see him anymore ?
 Yeah . But somebody 's gotta tell him about his new lawyer .
 Otherwise , the guy 's gonna show up , and he 's gonna go , " who the hell is he ? "
 Ian gets that .
 Besides ... why would it be a big deal ?
 Mike and I are over .
 I was just wondering , ' cause , you know ,
 You 're putting on lipstick to go to a prison .
 Thank you for clearing things up .
 Oh , well , it was the least I could do .
 Orson , I 'm truly sorry for the pain I 've caused , and if there 's anything else I can do ...
 Actually , there is .
 I 'd love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend .
 There are some friends that I 'm just ... dying for you to meet .
 You got me a lawyer ?
 Yeah , and he is fantastic .
 You cannot believe the scum he has gotten off .

 But , you know , if you were , you 'd be sitting pretty .
 I 'm paying you back -- every penny .
 Oh , well , you know , we 'll figure that out later .
 I- I can 't believe that
 I just listened to all that stuff Edie told me about you , and it turns out you 're the only one standing by me .
 You 're a good friend , Susan .
 Um , yeah , about that ...
 It 's Ian .
 He 's not crazy about me spending time with my ex .
 Even an ex who doesn 't remember dating you ?
 I remember , and I guess that 's enough for him .
 I 'm sorry .
 Well , I , uh , can 't say that I blame him .
 Take care of yourself , Mike .
 You too , Susan .
 Dinner 's ready !
 Kayla , I made your favorite :
 Tacos !
 Here you go .
 Where 's my daddy ? Oh .
 Sorry , sweetheart , he 's working late , trying to get the restaurant ready .
 Oh , lovely , Parker . Go wash your hands . - Phooey !
 Kayla , where are you going ?
 To watch TV .
 Oh , sweetie , we don 't watch TV during dinner .
 But my show is on !
 Well , I 'm sorry . Those are the rules .
 My Mommie let me .
 What ?
 Just this once .
 Oh .
 OK , OK . I know what you 're thinking .
 But Kayla is going through a hard time . Come and sit down .
 Letting her watch TV is like me letting you eat ice cream when you 're sick .
 But she 's not sick !
 Well , that 's true , but she 's sad .
 I 'm sad . I can watch TV ?
 Eat your tacos .
 Whoa , whoa ! Sit your butts down !
 It 's not fair .
 I don 't care ! We have rules !
 Well , she gets to .
 She is special . Now sit down !
 Come on .
 Does she get dessert , too ? Of course they do .
 What an amazing documentary , huh ?
 You know , I read the director shot over 400 hours of film .
 Really ? I only counted half at .
 I get it . You pick the next one .
 Okay . Mmm .
 Look at you ! Who knew you were such a romantic ?
 Actually , I ... I didn 't send them .
 You didn 't ?
 So , uh , who 's making me look bad ?
 Uh , there 's no signature .
 Sorry . This is kind of awkward .
 No , I- I don 't care who worships you from afar , as long as I get to do it up close .
 Oh .

 That 's sweet that you 're not ... jealous .
 Carlos would 've hit the roof if some guy sent me ...
 Would you excuse me a minute ?
 Nice try , Carlos . Huh ?
 - Oh , don 't act innocent . You know you sent me these flowers .
 why would I get you flowers ?
 To sabotage my new relationship .
 Oh , with picnic boy ? What do I care if you go out with him ?
 Oh , you care . First , you move across the street .
 And then , earlier today , I catch you spying on me --
 I was not spying . I was mocking you .
 You need to move on , Carlos . I have moved on !
 You 're the one talking to your ex during the middle of a date .
 Is he that boring ?
 Bill is not boring .
 He is vibrant ...
 Hmm .
 And -- and sexy .
 And yet here you are .
 She threw your doll in the trash ?
 No .
 First , she ripped off its arms , stuffed it with chili . she threw it in the trash .
 So what did you do ?
 Nothing .
 And this is after you let her watch TV during dinner ?
 Well , I didn 't know what else to do .
 I 'm trying to win over a little girl who clearly doesn 't want a new mother .
 Well , I guess giving her special treatment isn 't gonna solve anything .
 You know what might solve something ?
 Hmm ?
 If you were home once in a while . You 're the one she listens to .
 I am trying to open up a restaurant . Our life savings is riding on this thing .
 I know , I know . I know .
 You know what ?
 I don 't want you to be afraid to take a firm hand with Kayla .
 She 's part of our family now , and ... you know what that means .
 Yeah .
 I should treat her as badly as I treat my own children .
 Exactly .
 Uh ...
 Sorry . Um ...
 I 'm not sure I 'm ... ready for that yet .
 That 's cool .
 You can 't blame me for trying , though .
 Austin , you know I want to . It 's just ...
 - Hey , don 't sweat it .
 All right , if you 're not ready , you 're not ready .
 So he didn 't pressure you at all ? What a great guy .
 I know . I 'm so lucky . Underneath all that bad boy posturing , he 's ... a real gentleman .
 Wow , you 're not only virgin .
 You think like one .
 Beat it , eavesdropper .
 No , wait . Um ...
 What did you mean by that ?
 Well , uh ... guys need sex .
 All right ?
 It 's basic science . So if he 's not getting it from you , he 'll end up getting it somewhere else .
 You 're a moron . Not all guys pressure girls for sex .
 Yeah , gay guys don 't .
 But Austin 's not gay , not even after three beers .
 Don 't ask .
 So what 's your point ?
 If a guy has to wait too long to see you naked , he 'll end up seeing you as a friend .
 Again ... science .
 Don 't listen to him . You hold on to your virginity .
 If Austin won 't wait , then he doesn 't deserve you .
 I just don 't wanna lose him .
 It 's better than losing your self- respect .
 Take it from a girl who 's known at school as " Little Miss Van De Tramp . "
 I thought you made that up .
 Only 'cause it was nicer than the other names they were calling me .
 I really appreciate you donating this stuff . Anything for a good cause .
 Everyone at the shelter 's gonna be so excited .
 - Yeah .
 I mean , to you and me , these are just a bunch of old clothes .
 But to a homeless woman ...
 It 's a chance for her to feel pretty again . You okay ?
 What ?
 I asked if you 're okay . You seem kind of distracted .
 I ... am fine .
 Yes , I just remembered today 's my mother 's birthday .

 Can we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter ? Yeah .

 Detective Ridley , my name is Susan Mayer ,
 And I 'm calling to " drop a dime " on someone . That 's the expression , right ? Yes , ma 'am .
 You 've got the lingo down pat . Good .
 Uh ...
 His name is Orson Hodge , and he had an affair with the woman that you think Mike Delfino killed . Monique Polier ?
 Are you sure ? Because mr . Hodge saw her body in the morgue .
 He acted like he didn 't know her .
 Well , he does , and so he 's pretending he didn 't . That 's suspicious , right ? Well , um .
 Oh , uh , can you hold on ?
 Hello ?
 Susan . Hi .
 It 's Bree . Bree ?
 Uh ... Hi . Can you hold on a second ?
 It 's Orson 's wife .
 She can 't know I called you . Then how about you don 't tell her ?
 - Right .
 Sorry .
 Uh , I 'm just new to this whole snitch thing .
 Hold on , okay ?
 Bree , hi . Sorry about that .
 Damn telemarketer . So what can I do for you ?
 I just feel really awful about our fight , and I- I think it 's time for an apology .
 Oh .
 Bree , I am relieved .
 Would you join Orson and me for dinner tomorrow night ? Oh , uh ...
 Sure . Good .
 I 'll see you at 8 : 00 . Bree ...
 I just want you to know that no matter what , your friendship means the world to me .
 Oh , Susan , you know , I feel exactly --
 It 's me again .
 You should also know that Orson spent a year in an asylum .
 Hi .
 Can I help you ? Hi .
 Uh , I received some flowers from your shop yesterday , and the card didn 't say who they were from .
 Can you check ?
 The name is Solis . Sure , sure .
 Just give me a sec here . Solis ?
 Yeah .

 Solis ... Solis ...
 Huh . This is odd .
 The buyer asked to remain anonymous .
 Really ?
 Uh , well , the flowers were so beautiful , I 'd like to know who to thank .

 Sorry .
 I have to honor their request . Why ? They 're just flowers .
 They 're not government secrets .

 If you don 't mind , I 'm busy . Well , okay , wait , wait , wait , let me explain .
 What 's to explain ?
 A pretty girl gets flowers .
 I work in a flower shop . I 've never gotten any freakin ' flowers !
 So stop your whining about who sent them and just be glad he did .
 Uh , you 're right , and I am so sorry for taking up so much of your time .
 Sorry for doing this . Hey !
 What the hell are you doing ? hey , hey , hey !
 I 'm gonna make it up to you , okay ?
 Once I 'm done , I 'll send you flowers .

 Hey !
 You won 't get away with this ! I know where you live !
 - Yeah ? Well , stop by .
 We 'll hot tub .
 Hey , mister , help ! She locked me in here !
 Gaby ?

 This is totally her fault .
 I mean , I simply asked her if Carlos sent me the flowers , and she refused to show me the order slip .
 Are you still hung up on that ?
 For God 's sake .
 - No ! Wait ! I just need a couple more minutes .
 I need to know the truth .
 - What truth is that , huh ?
 That you 're still obsessed with your ex- husband ?
 What ? !
 No , 's obsessed with
 You just imprisoned a florist to find out if he sent you roses .
 Okay , I see what you mean . Here .
 I 'm done . Let 's go .
 Actually ...
 I think I 'm done , too .

 I 'm sorry . It 's okay .
 I 'm probably not ready to date .

 Thanks . and just so you know , I ready to date .
 All right , let 's hit it .
 Now come on , Kayla . I haven 't finished my ice cream .
 - Well , I 'm sorry , but we got to go .
 I have a dinner party I have to get to . They got to finish their ice cream .

 Well , they , uh , you know , wolfed it down like kids are supposed to . So ... hurry it up .

 Kayla , I 'm not fooling around . We -- we 're going .

 Mm- hmm . Okay . Boys , go to the car .
 I 'll be out in a minute .
 Go .
 Listen , sweetheart , I don 't blame you for being angry .
 Your mom 's gone , and you 're stuck with me .
 But ...
 the last thing she said to me was ,
 " promise you 'll take care of Kayla , " and I am going to .
 But you 're gonna have to help me , okay ?
 We can leave when I 'm done .
 Okay , let 's go . Hey , whoa !
 Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Okay . What the hell are you doing ? !
 Stop , stop ! Stop screaming !
 Stop ! Leave me alone !
 You 're not my mommy !

 Oh .
 Guys , how would you like to eat dinner in front of the television for a whole week ?
 What are you guys doing here ?
 Kayla , stop screaming ! You 're hurting my ears !
 Get in the car !
 - Aah !
 Come on !
 We 're going home ! - Aah !
 Get your seat belt on !
 Kids -- they 're always roughhousing .
 Why 'd you stop ?
 Well , uh , it 's getting late . I got your blouse unbuttoned .
 That 's usually when we call it a night .

 Do you wanna call it a night ? What , do you wanna grab a pizza or something ?

 I wanna do what ... You wanna do . Well ...
 You know what I wanna do .
 Well , okay . Are you sure ?

 Yeah , I 'm sure .
 You can always spot the new guys by the way they pick through their food .
 So what did you do when you thought no one was looking ?
 Cops say I killed a woman . But you didn 't , right ?

 Actually , I have no idea .
 Got pretty banged up in an accident .
 Last two years are blank .
 Well , that 's a fresh approach .
 Not sure the jury 's gonna swallow it . It 's the truth .

 I believe you .
 OK .
 Mrs McCluskey 's downstairs , and we will be right across the street if you need us . OK , daddy .

 You know , I heard what happened with Lynette today .
 Hey , she is doing her best . Why are you being so hard on her ?
 ' Cause it 's her fault my mommy died .
 No .
 No , honey , it 's not . Mom only went to that store
 Because Lynette was trying to steal me . No . That is not true .
 Look , honey , it is way more complicated than that .
 I know you miss your mommy . And she loved you very much . But guess what :
 Lynette loves you too .

 That 's why you gotta give her a chance . Can you do that for me ?

 OK .
 I 'll be good . That 's my girl !

 But I 'm never gonna love her .
 And you can 't make me .
 Well , you 've won . What did I win ?

 Bill and I split up . Can 't say I 'm surprised .
 He wasn 't right for you .
 I know .
 So just admit you sent the flowers .
 I didn 't .
 Carlos , just tell me . I won 't be mad .
 I promise . gaby , if I was gonna send you flowers ,
 I wouldn 't send you pink roses .
 I 'd send you white orchids , because I know they 're your favorite .

 And if I wanted to cheer you up -- sunflowers .
 And for the flu ... blue irises .

 I hate that you know me so well , and it took so long for that to happen .
 Now I have to start over again with somebody else .
 Yeah .
 That 's what dating 's for .
 I know , and it sucks .
 I mean , you saw me .
 I went on a picnic and ate pudding out of a can . It was horrible .

 well , if it makes you feel any better , I got dragged to the ballet the other night .

 so you dating .
 That 's why you 've been lifting weights and jogging .
 Well , if you wanna bag the big game , gotta work on the guns .
 I 'll give you this --
 You 're gonna be a tough act to follow , Carlos .
 Back at ya , babe .
 I 'm so sorry to keep you waiting , but I don 't want to introduce you until all my guests are here .
 - I don 't mind .
 By the way , um , when my friends ask you what happened -- and they will --
 I don 't think it 's necessary to go into all that unpleasantness about Orson and Monique .
 All they need to know is that you 're back and we 're on good terms . And Orson didn 't kill me .
 And Orson didn 't kill you .
 Oh , okay , just one minute . That 'll be Susan .
 Hi .
 I brought you a Bundt cake . Don 't worry . I didn 't make it .
 Oh , you didn 't have to do that .
 - I was really touched .
 It was so big of you .
 Well , when you 're wrong , you 're wrong .
 Now that we 're all assembled , I 'd like to introduce the guest of honor .
 I hope you 'll all be as delighted to meet her as I was . You can come in now .

 Everyone , this is Alma Hodge . Orson 's first wife .
 Oh , about that apology ... Any time you 're ready .

 So you have been in Canada this entire time ?
 Well , my aunt Agnes has a place in Winnipeg .
 I hadn 't planned on staying so long , but I needed the time to find myself .
 - It would 've been nice if someone could have found you .
 There was a whole lot of drama around here .
 - Yes , I heard .
 People actually thought Orson had done away with me ?
 Amazing , isn 't it , where some people 's minds will go ?
 Well , you gotta hand it to her . Just when you think
 Bree 's thrown every conceivable theme party , she hosts a " Shame on you for thinking my husband killed someone " dinner .
 - So Alma 's alive . Big deal . We still don 't know what went down between Orson and Monique .
 Susan , please .
 We look stupid enough for suspecting him . Just let it go .

 It may be a little late for that . Detective Ridley .
 Can I help you ?
 Yes . I 'd like to speak to your husband .

 Oh , well , I 'm afraid he 's not here , but I will be happy to tell him that you came by .
 who is it , darling ?
 excuse us .
 Can 't this wait ? We 're having a dinner party . hello , dr .
 Hodge . Detective Ridley .
 We need you to come with us .
 We have some questions about that Jane Doe we showed you in the morgue .
 - Why do you think I 'd know anything about her ? well , you having an affair with her when she died .
 Oh , where did you hear that ?
 Susan ?
 I didn 't know they were gonna come tonight .
 Uh , I 'm happy to answer any questions that you might have . My apologies .
 Please , stay . Enjoy the dessert .

 I don 't believe this . You called the police ?
 Well , obviously , you weren 't going to .
 They needed to know that that dead woman was Orson 's mistress .
 I told you that in confidence . - Did you seriously think
 I could sit on information that would exonerate Mike ?
 I mean , if you had seen his face in jail the other day ... The other day ?
 You -- you saw Mike ? Yeah .
 I 've just to tell him about the lawyer .
 I that Mike is innocent . Right , just like you knew she was dead .

 I thought we had an agreement . We do .
 Can we talk about this later ? When ?
 After your next conjugal visit ?
 Ian .
 Wait !
 Boy , when it comes to Mike , there 's no one you won 't betray . Excuse me ?
 Hey , guys ...
 Please leave my house .
 Bree ! - You heard me .
 Get out !
 Okay , Bree , I know you 're angry , but for the sake of our friendship --
 Oh , make no mistake , our friendship is over .
 Okay . You go ... Okay .

 So , Winnipeg ... must get pretty cold up there .
 I 'm just getting my coat . - Ian , please , I just lost one of my best friends .
 I can 't lose you , too .
 - You said that you wouldn 't see him again .
 But you had to know that I would go one more time to just explain everything .
 - Actually , no , I didn 't .
 Well , that 's just crazy !
 Why are you acting like a crazy person ?
 Because you 've already left me once for this -- this guy !
 Things are different now ! I- I love you ! You -- you don 't have to worry about that anymore .
 If we 're gonna make this relationship work , then you have to trust me , and why are you smiling at me ?
 You just said that you love me . - Yeah ? So ?
 Well , you 've never said that before .
 - Yes , I have . No .
 I- I- I would 've remembered .
 Well , I 'm saying it now .
 I love you . Do you have a problem with that ?
 - No , ma 'am .
 You -- you -- you can 't kiss me now .
 I 'm yelling at you .
 Well , I 'm listening .
 Well ... don 't -- don 't think that you can get out of this , you know , by just ...
 Oh , God . Oh , yeah , uh , oh , yeah , right -- right there .
 Oh , right there .
 Look , I think we should stop doing this .
 I know it 's my idea , but it just doesn 't feel right anymore .
 You slept with Julie . It 's no big deal .
 Well , it is to her , and I don 't want to see her get hurt . Me , either .

 so let 's just not tell her .
 there 's no place in fairview that 's more peaceful . All the floors are hardwood .
 Oh , there are brand- new appliances .
 And the gardens are ... well , they 're beautiful .

 So ... what do you think ?
 I 'll take it . Really ?
 That 's terrific !
 I 'll draw up the papers in the morning .

 If you don 't mind me asking , why were you so interested in this particular street ?
 I 've been moving around a lot in the last few months , and I need a place where I can really settle down .
 You know what I mean ?
 I wanna live in a place where people still have some sense of moral value and where friendships are good and strong and last forever .

 That 's what I 'm looking for .
 Then I think Wisteria Lane is the place for you . Good .
 More than anything , I just want to fit in .
