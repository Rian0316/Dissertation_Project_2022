 We can 't be accused of wasting money ?
 - Absolutely . - We are taking the smallest possible delegation ?


 - Absolutely .
 Pared to the bone .
 - Who are all those people ?
 - Our delegation . - You said it 'd been pared to the bone .

 - So it has ?
 - Who are they ?
 A small delegation from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office .
 - But this is a DAA mission . - Yes , well , we are going abroad .

 Foreign policy is at stake .
 We 're going to ratify a contract for one of the biggest export orders Britain 's ever obtained .
 That was negotiated by British Electronic Systems .
 Who are all these civil servants ?
 There 's a delegation from the Department of Trade and one from Industry .
 There 's a group from Energy .
 We are going to an oil sheikdom .
 There 's a Deputy Secretary leading a team from the Cabinet Office .
 There 's a group from the Central Office of Information , there 's our DAA team .
 Press secretaries , private secretaries , liaison secretaries .
 The legal department who did the contract , those who supervised it .
 - Pared to the bone ?
 - To the bone .
 If we 'd met in Middlesbrough , we 'd have only taken seven people .
 Well , Teesside is perhaps not quite so diplomatically significant as Kumran .
 - Teesside returns four MPs .
 - Kumran controls Shell and BP .
 - What are you doing here ? - Purely my sense of duty- free .

 Duty- free ?
 Er ... duty , free from any personal consideration .
 - Look through this .
 - What is it ?
 - It 's the final communiqué .
 - The final ... ? !
 You can 't write it before the meeting !
 On the contrary , you can 't write it AFTER the meeting .
 We had to get agreement from other departments , the EEC , Washington , the Kumrani Embassy .
 - You can 't do that in the desert .
 - It may bear no relation to what we say .
 No communiqué ever bears any relation to what you say .
 - Then why have one ?
 - It gets you past the press corps .
 The journalists need to justify their huge expenses for a futile non- event .
 - Non- event ?
 - Oh , a brilliant triumph for you , Minister .
 Which is why it 's a futile non- event for the press .
 They 'd like me to get drunk at the reception .
 Yes . Not much hope of that .
 Kumran is dry .
 Yeah .
 Well , of course , it is in the middle of the desert .
 - You mean ... Islamic law ?
 - Alas , yes .
 - We can get a drink at the British Embassy ?
 - Yes . But the reception and the dinner are at the palace .

 Five hours of orange juice .
 Five hours ?
 Without a single drinky ?
 Why did you let me come on this trip ?
 What are we going to do ?
 Hip flasks ?
 No , much too risky .
 We have to grin and bear it .
 Why don 't we set up a security communications room next door to the reception ?
 You know , emergency telephones , telex lines to Downing Street .
 Then we could fill it with booze brought in from the Embassy .
 - Minister !
 - Liven up the orange juice !
 That is a ... stroke of genius !
 - Could it be done ? - Such a room would need a major crisis .

 - Five hours on orange juice is a major crisis .
 - The pound is under pressure .
 - Could you arrange it ?
 - I think I can guarantee enthusiastic support .
 Most awfully generous of you to present me with this very splendid gift .
 Oops ! - It is a great pleasure to commemorate this day .
 - It 's so beautiful !
 A magnificent example of 17th- century Islamic art .
 - What was it originally ? - A rosewater jar .

 - I see . For ... er ... rosewater , presumably ?
 - Quite so .
 Minister , there 's an urgent call for you in the communications room . A Mr Haig .
 General Haig ?
 No , MR Haig . You know , with the dimples .


 Yes , yes . Do excuse me .
 Most important .
 - I believe there 's a message from Mr Haig .
 - Yes , Minister .
 - I 'm the only woman here . - Special dispensation .

 They 've made you an honorary man for the evening .
 - This will look wonderful on our hall table . - Mrs Hacker , I 'm not sure if ...
 - If what ? - It 's a gift to the minister .
 It 's his hall , too .
 - I don 't think you 'll be allowed to keep it .
 - Why ever not ?
 It could be thought , if it were valuable , it could influence some ministers .
 Not your minister , that is , my minister , our minister .
 Your husband , as it were .
 As it is , in fact . I mean , he is .
 I mean ...
 Well , some ministers ...
 - Bernard .
 - Sorry .
 - Are you saying we have to give it back ?
 - No , that 'd be an insult .
 - We can 't give it back . What do I do ? - It becomes government property .

 - It 's put in a basement in Whitehall .
 - You sure we can 't keep it ?
 - Not if it 's worth more than £50 .
 - How do we find out ?
 - You get a valuation .
 - Could you get a valuation ?
 Wouldn 't it be wonderful if it was less than £50 ? Because it 's awfully pretty .
 Well , I ...
 - I suppose I could try . - Oh , Bernard , you are wonderful !

 What would we do without you ?
 Bernard .
 Wanted in the communications room .
 A Mr John Walker .
 - Johnnie Walker ? - Yes , from the Scotch Office ...
 Sorry .
 - Scottish Office .
 - Isn 't there a message for me ?
 Yes , of course .
 Bernard will get it for you if you give him your glass .
 If you ... ... give him your glass , he 'll get you some more orange juice .
 - Is Humphrey here yet ? - Yes , he 's just over here .

 Excuse me .
 Ahem . Excuse me .
 - Minister .
 - What on earth ... ? !
 Traditional Foreign Office courtesy to our Arab hosts , isn 't that right ?
 Spot on , Humphrey .
 Isn 't that right , Your Royal Highness ?
 Yes , we regard it as a warm and gracious compliment .
 May I present our minister ?
 This is Prince Mohammed .
 - How do you do ? - Pleased to meet you , Your Excellency .

 Excellency !
 I say , if you 'll excuse me , I just must have a quick word with Sir Humphrey .
 I can 't believe my eyes !
 What are you here as ?
 Ali Baba ?
 - Minister , when in Rome ... - We are not in Rome .
 You look ridiculous !
 I suppose if we were in the Fiji Islands , you 'd wear a grass skirt !
 The Foreign Office view , as Arabs are sensitive , is we should show them whose side we 're on .
 It may come as a surprise to the Foreign Office , but you 're supposed to be on OUR side !
 - Bernard , any messages ? - Well , there is one for Sir Humphrey .

 - Oh , good .
 - The Soviet Embassy on the line .
 Mr Smirnoff .
 Sorry .
 So sorry .
 Isn 't there one for me ?
 There was a message from the Embassy , the school - a delegation of Teachers .
 Ah , I must go and greet the Teachers ... ... before the Bells goes ... bell goes !
 You 're receiving a great many very urgent messages .
 - Yes , yes , we are , aren 't we ?
 - Excuse me .
 Your Royal Highness , could I present Mr Pennington ?
 - Excuse me .
 - Yes , of course , Your Highness .
 Excuse me , but I could not help overhearing your conversation about valuing the gift .
 - Perhaps I can help .
 - That would be ...
 - Do you have any idea how much ?
 - Of course .
 An original 17th- century rosewater jar is very valuable .
 - Oh , dear .
 - You are not pleased ?
 Yes and no . If it 's valuable , the minister won 't be allowed to keep it .

 - I was rather hoping it wasn 't .
 - Ah .
 Well , as I was saying , an original 17th- century rosewater jar is very valuable , but this copy , though excellently done , is not of the same order .
 Oh , good .
 About how much ?
 - I would be interested to hear your guess . - Oh .
 Er ... well , a little under ... £50 ?
 Brilliant ! Quite a connoisseur !

 - And you would sign a valuation certificate ?
 - But of course .
 - Your English customs are very strange .
 - Oh , why ?
 You are so strict about a gift , yet your electronics company pays our finance minister a million dollars to secure this contract .
 Is this not strange ?
 - You ... You don 't mean ...
 - Of course .
 I work for the minister .
 I got my share .
 - What for ?
 - For keeping my mouth shut .
 L- I see . Would you excuse me for a moment ?

 Minister , can I have a private word with Sir Humphrey ?
 You may speak freely , Bernie .
 Yes ... Oh , there was a message for you in the communications room .
 - The VAT man , your 69 returns .
 - What ? ! - VAT 69 .
 - Oh .
 Ah ! Yes ... thanks .
 I 'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that the minister has had almost as many urgent messages as he can take .
 - I 've found out the most terrible thing .
 - Dear me .
 This contract was obtained by bribery .
 Of course .
 All contracts in Kumran are obtained by bribery .
 Everybody knows that .
 It 's all right , as long as nobody knows .
 - Shouldn 't we tell the minister ?
 - Certainly not .
 - But if everybody knows .
 - Everybody else .
 We do not let a minister know what everybody else knows .
 Highness , how very nice to see you .
 Ah , Lawrence of Arabia , you 're wanted in the communications room .
 Oh , good .
 Er , who is it ?
 Napoleon !
 " It is alleged in Le Monde that the recent British contract with Kumran
 " was won by bribery . "
 - Do you hear this , Humphrey ?
 - Yes , indeed .
 " It 's part of a hideous web of corruption woven by Western industrial countries
 " and Third World governments that forms a blot of our modern civilisation . "
 - Webs don 't form blots , Minister .
 - What ?
 Well , spiders don 't have any ink , you see .
 Only cuttlefish .
 - Spiders don 't ... ! What are you talking about ?
 - I know ...
 - Thank you , Bernard . - Isn 't this terrible ?
 Baseless accusations !
 Oh , yes , yes , terrible .
 Backsheesh , palm- greasing !
 Good God , we 're British !
 Absolutely , Minister !
 It 's not like the FT to print a story like this unless there 's something behind it .
 - Is there something behind it , Humphrey ?
 - I think the sports news is behind it .
 - I want to know the truth , Humphrey .
 - I don 't think you do .
 - Will you answer a direct question ? - I strongly advise you not to ask one .
 - Why ?
 - It might provoke a direct answer .
 It never has yet .
 What do YOU know about this ?
 Tell me !
 Oh , well , I ... er ... Er , that is ... there was .
 Someone did .
 - A lot of gossip , that 's all .
 Rumour , hearsay .
 - Bernard ?
 - One Kumrani did tell me he 'd received ...
 - Hearsay , Minister .
 - Hearsay ? - Yes , Bernard heard him say it .

 Are you telling me that the contract was won by bribery ?
 I do wish you wouldn 't use words like bribery .
 What would you like me to say ?
 Slush funds , sweeteners , brown envelopes ?
 These are extremely crude and unworthy expressions for what is no more than creative negotiation .
 It is general practice .
 You do realise what you 're saying ? I ratified that contract in good faith !
 In that press communiqué , I announced a British success won in a fair fight !
 Mm , yes , I did wonder about that bit .
 - Now you 're telling me it was got by bribery .
 - No . - Oh , it was not got by bribery ? - That is not what I said .
 - What did you say ?
 - That I 'm not telling you it was got by bribery .
 - How would you describe these payments ?
 - How does the contract describe them ?
 Oh , well , that 's quite simple .
 Retainers , personal donations , special discounts .
 Miscellaneous outgoings , agents ' fees , political contributions , management expenses .
 How are these payments made ?
 Anything from a numbered Swiss account to a fistful of used oncers slipped under the door of the gents ' .
 - Do you realise how shocking this is ? - That is a narrow and parochial view .

 In other parts of the world , they see things differently .
 - Sin is not a branch of geography .
 - But it is .
 In developing countries , the size of the extra contractual payment shows how serious you are .
 It 's like a publisher 's advance to an author .
 Whoever pays the biggest advance expects the biggest sales .
 - I don 't believe it ! - ( BUZZER )
 Is corruption government policy ?
 No , no , Minister ! It could never be government policy !

 That is unthinkable ! Only government practice .

 That was the press office .
 The papers want a statement about the bribery allegation .
 What am I going to say ?
 The press office can devise something convincing and meaningless .
 That 's what they 're paid for .
 - You 're a cynic , Humphrey . - Cynic .

 A cynic is what an idealist calls a realist .
 I 'll tell the truth .
 After all , I knew nothing of this .
 Why should I back something I never approved ?
 But this contract means thousands of British jobs , millions of export dollars !
 Surely you won 't throw all that away because of a technical irregularity ?
 - It 's not a technical irregularity , it is corruption !
 - No .
 Merely a few uncontracted pre- payments .
 I don 't expect you to understand , but government is not just a question of fixing and manipulating .
 - There is a moral dimension . - Of , yes , of course , the moral dimension .
 It is never out of my thoughts .
 So if questions are asked in the press , I shall announce an inquiry .
 Splendid idea . I shall be happy to conduct it .

 No , no , no , no , no .
 No , not an internal inquiry , a REAL inquiry .
 - You can 't be serious !
 - A real inquiry .
 - I beg you ...
 - Humphrey ... the moral dimension .
 ( DOORBELL )
 - Good evening , Mrs Hacker .
 - Bernard , come in .
 - Thank you .
 - Is that you , Bernard ?
 - Yes , Minister .
 - Shan 't be a moment .
 - There 's that jar from Kumran .
 - A friend of mine was frightfully interested in it .
 - Really ? - Jenny Goodwin from The Guardian .

 - The Guardian ?
 - She asked where it came from .
 - A journalist ? - Yes .
 Well , The Guardian , anyway .
 - She asked what it was worth . I said £50 .
 - You said £50 .
 - Funnily enough , she thought it was genuine .
 - She thought it was genuine ?
 - Bernard , you sound like an answering machine .
 - Oh , I 'm sorry .
 She wanted to ring Kumran 's Embassy to ask what it was worth .
 To ask what it was worth .
 - So what did you say ?
 - I said , by all means .
 It is only a copy , isn 't it ?
 Well ... so far as I 'm ... ... so I 'm lead to ...
 Good gracious , is that the time ?
 - Bernard . - Sorry , the minister will be a few minutes late .
 - I 'll come back .
 - Actually , I wonder if I could have a word .
 Yes .
 - I said yes .
 - Yes , I know .
 You see ...
 Something the matter , Bernard ?
 Come on , out with it .
 Did you send the minister to the wrong dinner ?
 Give him the wrong speech ?
 Show him some papers we didn 't mean him to see ?
 Worse ?
 Much worse ?
 Sit down .
 Well ... tell me about it .
 You know that jar the minister was given in Kumran ?
 - Well , the minister 's wife ... liked it .
 - I expect she did .
 Then , when I explained the rules to her , she looked ... terribly sad .
 They always do .
 She said wouldn 't it be marvellous if it wasn 't worth more than £50 and she sort of ... looked at me .
 But , my dear Bernard , a 17th- century vase !
 Yes , I know , but there was this terribly nice Kumrani businessman and we had a ... a ... a ... conversation and he valued it as a copy , not as an original - £49 . 95p .
 - You believed him .
 - He said he was an expert .
 He spoke Arabic awfully well ... and so I accepted his valuation in good faith .
 After all , Islam is a jolly good faith .
 You took a grave personal risk .
 You 're lucky nobody 's asked questions .
 A journalist saw it in the minister 's house and asked a lot of questions .
 Mrs Hacker said it was a copy , but the press are so ... horribly suspicious about things .
 - Despicable ! - So ... what shall I do ?

 The minister must be told .
 Sorry to keep you .
 - That 's all right .
 Have you read my submission ?
 - I did , and it won 't do .
 I won 't be accused of sweeping bribery under the carpet .
 If questions are asked , I will announce an independent inquiry chaired by a QC .
 You can 't ! That contract is worth £340 million !

 Get thee behind me , Humphrey !
 The moral dimension .
 Minister , if there is an inquiry , other things may come out , too .
 Such as ?
 I 'm afraid Bernard ... has something to tell you .
 Well ?
 - Well ?
 - You know that jar the Kumranis gave you ?
 Yes , it 's at the flat now .
 Most attractive .
 I told Mrs Hacker she could keep it , as it was valued for less than £50 .
 The valuer was awfully nice and I told him Mrs Hacker liked it a lot , but he may have been just , well , being helpful .
 It 's all right , Bernard .
 No one will ever know . Jolly enterprising of you .

 Mrs Hacker told me a journalist was asking questions .
 - Journalist ? !
 - Can I just see that valuation ?
 Hmm .
 The Treasury isn 't too happy about valuations written on the backs of menus .
 It is a very good menu .
 What is it worth ?
 - If it 's a copy , what the valuation says .
 - And if it 's ... genuine ?
 About £5, 000 .
 Oh , my God , I kept it !
 Bill from the press office wants to talk to you .
 I 'm trying to deal with this problem you 've landed me with !
 - That 's what he wants to talk to you about .
 - Well ? The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is in a state .
 Mrs Hacker has told The Guardian that valuable 17th- century thing presented to you by Kumran was a copy .
 The Guardian phoned the Kumrani Embassy for their comments .
 The Kumran government are incensed at the suggestion they insulted Britain by giving you a worthless gift .
 It 's building up into the biggest diplomatic incident since " Death of a Princess " .
 There 's a reporter from The Guardian demanding to see you right away .
 Ahem .
 Yes , Bernard ?
 - Minister ... what are you ... - Bernard , my duty is clear .

 - I have no choice .
 - No choice ?
 No choice .
 I didn 't ask you to lie to my wife about the value of that gift .
 - No , but ...
 - I realise you acted from the purest motives .
 But there can be no excuse for falsifying a document .
 - But I ...
 - Let me continue .
 I cannot have it said that I asked you to do this .
 No more can I have it said that I connived at bribery and corruption .
 Enough is enough .
 If this journalist asks me straight questions on either of these subjects ... ... I shall have to give her straight answers .
 The moral dimension .
 Minister , I agree with you .
 I see now that there is a moral dimension to everything .
 Will you tell the press about the communications room or shall I ?
 What ? !
 You know , all the Scotch in Kumran .
 You mean to tell me that ... if I say ... ... then you will ... tell ... ... and drop me in the ...


 In the moral dimension .
 - This is different !
 It 's not the same thing !
 - Why ?
 - Drinking , it 's not corruption . - No , it 's just deceit .
 - Deceit ?
 - We have deceived the Kumranis .

 Tormented by the knowledge that we violated their sacred Islamic law in their own country .
 Sooner or later , we 'll have to own up and admit that it was all your idea .
 - It wasn 't ! - ( BOTH ) It was !

 It wasn 't ... was it ?
 Is it 50 lashes or 100 ?
 I must ask you to meet this journalist .
 - Oh , yes , all right .
 What am I going to say ?
 - I suggest attack is the best form of defence .
 Attack , attack , yes . Good thinking , Humphrey .
 Yes , got it .
 Miss Jenny Goodwin from The Guardian .
 Do come in . Sit down , Jenny .
 I may call you Jenny , may I not ?
 - If you like .
 - Now , what seems to be the trouble ?
 Two things . Both of them rather worrying to the public .

 The first is a story that was in the French press .
 It 's about corruption in BES - getting the Kumrani contract .
 - Complete nonsense !
 - They quoted reports of payments to officials .
 Really , this is absolutely typical .
 A British company slogs its guts out to win orders , create jobs !
 What does it get from the media ?
 A smear campaign !
 - If they won by bribery ...
 - There was no bribery .
 I had a full inquiry .
 - All these payments have been identified .
 - What as ?
 - Commission fees , administrative overheads .
 - Operative costs , managerial surcharges .
 Expenses , miscellaneous outgoings .
 We have looked into every brown envelope ... ... every ... ... every account book and everything is completely in order .

 - I see . - May I say one thing ?


 Allegations of this nature are symptomatic of a very sick society for which the media shares the blame !
 - The media ?
 - Why are you putting thousands of jobs at risk ?
 I 'll call on the Press Council to censure the press for its lack of professionalism in running this story .
 The Council and the House of Commons must be concerned about the standards which have applied in this disgraceful matter .
 Pressure will be brought to bear to make sure that this gutter press reporting is not repeated .
 I see .
 Ahem . Well , there is this other question .
 It 's about the rosewater jar apparently presented to you in Kumran .
 - Yes ? - I saw it in your flat , actually .

 - Yes , we 're keeping it there , temporarily .
 - Temporarily ?
 - Yes , it 's very valuable .
 - Mrs Hacker said it was an imitation .
 Burglars , girl , burglars !
 And you 've gossip ! That 's until we can get rid of it .

 - Get rid of it ?
 - I 'll present it to our local museum this weekend .
 I can 't hold onto it , you know .
 It 's government property .
 Now ... what was your question ?
 No ... er ... that 's all right , actually .
 Um ... I ...
 No , no , no , that 's fine .
 - Nothing more ? - No , no , that 's all .

 Well , good of you to drop in .
 - Thank you , Minister .
 - Goodbye , Jenny .
 Superb , Minister .
 - Thank you , Minister .
 - Oh , well , it was nothing .
 We must stick by one 's friends , eh , Humphrey ?
 Eh , Bernard ?
 Loyalty .
 ( BOTH ) Yes , Minister . http : // episode- heaven . rt . hu
