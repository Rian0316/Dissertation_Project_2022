 Hi ! Uh , Ola , is this my Titanic record ?

 Yeah , it 's great !
 [ chuckles ] Yeah . Well , the thing is , some of my records are quite rare .
 - I like to keep them in their place . - Dad , where 's my biology book ?
 [ Jakob in Swedish ] How would I know ?
 [ in English ] What were you saying ?
 Well , I was wondering whether maybe you could ask before taking my stuff .
 [ Jakob in Swedish ] Where 's my toothbrush ?
 [ in English ] In your washbag !
 Yeah , yeah . I 'll ask you next time .
 [ squeals ] Okay , this is scratched ! This is scratched !
 - No ! - Ola , this is a limited edition !
 Oh my gosh ! Calm down !
 - [ Otis ]
 Fuck me !
 - [ goat bleating ]
 [ Otis shouting indistinctly ]
 I 'm dropping Goat off at my auntie 's after this .
 [ Jean ] It 's not a problem , Aimee .
 And I want you to know that this is a safe space for you to share , and we can go as slowly as you want us to .
 [ Ola ] I told you . In your washbag !
 Will you excuse me just one minute ?
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 - [ Jean sighs ]
 - Um ...
 It 's okay .
 [ Otis ] It comes with a sleeve . A cover and a sleeve .
 There it is ! - Give it to me . Fuck !
 - [ Ola ]
 I 'm doing it .
 [ Otis ] You don 't take care of anything !
 There 's dust . You don 't have a case for the record player .
 [ Jakob in Swedish ] Ola ! Why do you need five shampoos ?
 - [ Otis in English ] It 's in here ! - What 's the big deal ?
 You took my property without asking !
 - You 're so anally retentive !
 - And you don 't understand boundaries !
 - She 's taken the Titanic without asking ! - He 's being over the top ...
 And I 'm sure you can both work it out
 like the responsible young adults that you apparently are !
 Quietly !
 [ Jakob shouts indistinctly in Swedish ] [ in English ] Get out !
 - [ Jakob continues shouting ] - Jakob , I have a client downstairs !
 Found it .
 Can everyone please keep it quiet while I 'm working ?
 It 's too loud !
 Ooh , ooh .
 [ whimsical music continues ] [ approaching footsteps ]
 Um , my vagina doesn 't look like this .
 One of my lip bits is longer than the other .
 Well , it 's just an educational model .
 The external part is called the vulva , and the lip bits you 're talking about are called the labia , and they come in all different shapes , sizes , and colors .
 There 's a fascinating website I could direct you to that highlights the wide variety of different vulvas if you 're interested ?
 - Yeah . - Great .
 Do you want to have a seat again ?
 [ sighs ]
 [ exhales ]
 Let 's try that again .
 Do you feel comfortable telling me a little bit about why you 're here ?
 Last term , I was sexually assaulted .
 And I thought that I was getting over it , but I don 't think I am .
 I used to like my body , and I used to like having sex , but ever since it happened , I don 't like the way my body feels .
 I don 't like looking at it .
 I don 't like my boyfriend touching it anymore .
 That must be difficult for you , Aimee .
 Do you think you could tell me a little bit more about the assault ?
 I was going to school , and everything felt normal .
 And then
 I got on the bus ...
 [ shuddered breath ] and there was this man .
 Sorry , I just find it hard to talk about it sometimes .
 It 's okay . We don 't have to talk about anything you don 't want to .
 I just wanna be the old me again .
 Well , you may never be the old you , Aimee , but that 's okay .
 As human beings , we are constantly changing and developing .
 And by processing this trauma , you may gain clarity on the event itself , and we can move you towards healing the relationship with your body again .

 Would you like that ?
 Yeah , I 'd like that .
 [ goat bleating ]

 Sorry .

 Hey .
 - Good morning . - [ Ola ] Morning .
 [ car horn honking ]
 Otis , do you think Ruby could give Ola a ride to school too ?
 I 'm not cool enough to be hanging around with the Untouchable King and Queen .
 Well , I hope that 's not true , Otis .
 I 'm meeting Lily anyway .
 I was thinking we could all hang out later , together ?
 - I 've got a date . I can 't . - I 'm busy too .

 I can 't have sex again .

 [ Ola ] You have no idea how annoying Otis is .
 It 's like he 's never shared a space with anyone before .
 [ sighs ]
 And they do things so differently there .
 Everything . Everything is so controlled . This is it !
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ Lily ] Where 'd it go ?
 It ... it was here , I swear .
 Maybe someone did it as a hoax .
 [ funky music playing ]
 [ indistinct chattering ]
 Good morning , Hope .
 I 've had ideas about how I can use my time as head girl in the most productive way .
 - Cool , hit me . - Great . I wanna create a Moordale newsletter run by students .
 I 've been researching how we can make the campus more green by using solar panels and tree planting .
 I wanna set up an environmental student board on campus .
 I read a study that said yoga during break time creates more efficiency , so free yoga classes alongside food- education classes .
 - And I think ... - That is fantastic .
 I want to set up a meeting to talk it through properly .
 In the meantime , I need you to make sure all your peers are wearing their uniforms correctly .
 Absolutely , will do .
 Okay . Any problems , you send them to me .
 - Hey . - Hey .
 [ Cal ] Hey , Jackson .
 Whoa , whoa ! Fuck .
 Falling at my feet now ?
 [ exhales ]
 [ Cal ] Man , you look kind of screwed , dude .
 Yeah , um ... [ coughs ]
 Everything got really fuzzy for a second .
 Did you forget to eat breakfast ?
 Breakfast is my favorite food .
 [ chuckles ]
 Okay , but is breakfast a food or a meal ?
 [ scoffs ]
 Thanks .
 Every time I see you , I feel like I 've known you for ages .
 [ chuckles ]
 I think that 's the dizzy spell talking .
 [ chuckles ] Come on , up you get .
 Hi ! Sorry . You 're in the wrong uniform .
 What is wrong about it ?
 It 's the boys ' uniform .
 It 's way too big for you .
 - I think it 's a comfortable fit .
 - I 'm following new guidelines .
 - You can let this one slide . - Sorry , I can 't .
 - You 'll have to talk to Hope about it .
 - Oh !
 Well , that 'll be fun .
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 Why did you do that ?
 I 'm not gonna disobey rules because you have a crush .
 I don 't have a crush . That 's not the point .
 Unlike you , I 'm taking head girl seriously .
 [ scoffs ]
 You can be so cutthroat sometimes , Viv .
 [ indistinct chattering ]
 I do not do fake wool .
 This blazer is itchy as fuck .

 - Yeah . - She didn 't mean you .
 - Hi , Ruby . - Hey .

 Come on . It 's not that bad .
 I kinda like it .
 [ Ruby ] OT !
 - Um , yeah . - See you .
 Okay , um , I 'm going to need you to make an effort tonight .
 - Okay .
 - I need you to talk , open up a bit .
 Okay , I understand .

 Hi , Rahim .
 I would like my books back .
 Pablo Neruda , Maya Angelou .
 Sure , I 'll bring them in for you .
 I 'd also like you to return the poems I wrote for you , that is , if you haven 't destroyed them .
 I still have the poems , yes .
 I burnt everything you ever gave me in a small , controlled fire , so ...
 Okay , I will get you your poems .
 - Thank you . Thank you . - Thank you .
 - You have confiture on your tie .
 - Hm ?

 Hi . How was therapy ? Oh , it was amazing !
 Do you know most women 's vulvas don 't look like they do on PornHub ?
 I thought mine was a bit ugly because it 's not all tucked in , but it 's dead normal .
 You should read by Emily Nagoski . It 's a great book .
 - I 'll lend it to you . - Okay .
 You look nice , babe .
 Is everything okay ?
 I feel like we barely see each other at the moment .
 Aw , everything 's fine .
 Just really busy with my baking .
 Good morning , Moordale .
 Don 't you all look smart ?

 - Yes . Come on in . Shut the door , please .

 Cal , you can go and put these on .
 [ Cal grunts ]
 I 'm not wearing a skirt .
 Fine .
 You don 't want to wear a skirt , that 's up to you .
 I 'm a feminist .
 I understand .
 But you will wear a uniform that fits you .
 No baggy trousers hanging around your ankles .
 - I actually ... - I think I 'm being more than fair .
 Lily , your hair and makeup is fun , but it 's not appropriate for school .
 Maeve , this isn 't a campus for Cookie Monsters .
 - Are you referring to my hair ? - I am .
 Ola , only school badges allowed , I 'm afraid .
 It 's my LGBTQlA+ badge .
 It 's important to me .
 Of course it is , but I hope that your values aren 't so fragile that a little badge is all that supports them .
 Remove it .
 Lily , am I right in thinking that you wrote the musical last term ?
 What did your parents think of it ?
 They didn 't really get it .
 Hm .
 Well , enjoy the VoVos .
 Back to class .
 [ whimsical music continues ]
 Oh , Maeve ?
 Miss Sands tells me you 're interested in applying for the Gifted & Talented program in the States .
 Uh , no , I can 't afford it .
 I want opportunities in this school to be for everyone , no matter their background , so I 'm going to see what I can do about getting some funding , so you better get that application in as soon as you can .

 Okay .
 I will .
 - Thank you .
 - Yep .
 And I mean it about the hair .
 [ phone beeps ]
 Thank you . Hope will see you now .

 - [ girls laughing ] - God , what is with that weird crop top ?
 [ girl ]
 Shut it !

 [ lock rattling ]
 Maeve 's changed the locks .
 Yeah , I can see that .
 The thing is , I think I left my passport in there and it needs renewing .
 - Have you got a spare key ?
 - No , sorry , I don 't .
 Why don 't you come wait inside until Maeve gets back ?
 I can offer you a tea , but you 'll have to make it yourself .
 - My brother 's out . - It looks just like her , don 't it ?
 How have you done that ?
 - You never .
 - Mm .
 Well , you 're very talented .
 You 've even captured her angry eyebrows .
 She feels awful .
 Talks about it all the time .
 She was just worried about Elsie ...
 Well , it 's not really any of your business , is it ?
 Sorry .
 Would you like me to paint your portrait ?
 - I couldn 't afford anything like that . - It 's fine .
 I like to practice , and I think you got a great face .
 I did once get asked to be a hair model .
 Just some academy wanting to experiment on people , but still , nice to be asked .
 Okay , then .
 Where 'd you want me ?
 Just in the corner where the light 's good , actually , would be great .
 I 'm not stripping off !
 [ bell ringing ]
 [ Otis ] Maeve ?
 Did you , uh , did you call me earlier ?
 Hm ?
 Oh yeah , I did ! But it was an accident .
 Oh , okay .
 - What do you think of the whole ... - Actually , Otis , I need to talk to you ...
 What are you doing here , cock biter ?
 Don 't call her that , please .
 Your girlfriend 's charming .
 - What did you wanna talk about ? - Don 't worry about it .
 [ Ruby exhales ]
 - So 6 : 30 tonight , yeah ? - Yeah .
 Well , I was thinking I could meet you at yours at six , walk in together ?
 No , it 's fine . I 'll just meet you at the restaurant .
 Okay , bye .
 But you 're still taking me home now , right ?
 - Wanna do homework later ? - Not really .
 - Why you being so weird ?
 - Oh , um , because you stole my job , Viv .
 I don 't understand why you 're pretending you cared about being head boy when you didn 't .
 This is an amazing opportunity for me .
 Well , I hope it 's worth it .
 Yo !
 - Hey . No more dizzy spells , then ? - [ scoffs ]
 No .
 You wanna hang out with me ?
 Yeah .

 Isaac , tell Maeve I need to get my passport from the caravan , and tell her I 'm having my picture done because you said I had a nice face .
 [ Isaac ] I think she heard you .
 We 'll be a bit longer , I think , while the light 's good .
 Why don 't you come get your passport once you 're done ?
 Isaac , tell Maeve I 'll come get my passport once I 'm done here .
 - Have you got that ?
 - Yeah .

 Excuse me , Jean . I was wondering whether you had any tampons ?
 Sorry to be awkward . I just got my period , and I 've run out .
 No , it 's not awkward at all . I think I 've got some up in my bedroom .
 - Your dad has very good taste .
 - Those were my mum 's , actually .
 She loved everything with peonies .
 This must be an especially hard transition for you , Ola , and I want you to know that you can talk to me about it at any time .
 Okay .
 Did you get pregnant on purpose to trap my dad ?
 No !
 Of course not .
 You really hurt him last time .
 He didn 't get out of bed for weeks .
 [ sighs , tuts ]
 He 's been through so much .
 I 'm not gonna let it happen again .
 - I really care for your dad .
 - Then why did you hurt him before ?
 [ Otis ] Ola , have you used my razor ?
 - It 's blunt and covered in hair . - Yeah . I couldn 't find mine , sorry .
 Great . Guess I have to start labeling my shit .
 - Otis , that 's very ungenerous of you . - We 're not real siblings , Mum .
 It 's okay . He 's going to have a real half- sibling soon .
 So maybe he 'll be less of an arsehole to them .
 Yeah , I 've gotta go .

 Yes , right .

 Why did you go all woozy today ?
 It 's anxiety .
 I 've always had it , but it 's been pretty bad recently .
 Mm- hmm .
 I think now I 'm not swimming , I haven 't got a routine .
 I get triggered by the most random stuff .
 It 's okay . I have anxiety , too , so I get it .
 - What was the trigger this time ? - Just school .
 I was thinking if I don 't swim anymore and I 'm not head boy , and I 'm not very good at acting , then who the hell am I ?
 Like , maybe I don 't care about anything enough .
 Whoa . You 're 17 . You don 't have to have it figured out .
 [ exhales sharply ]
 This is not the message the world is giving me .

 Isn 't it illegal to be gay in Nigeria ?
 Yeah , it is , but no one knows I am there , so ...
 [ Adam ] I didn 't know it was illegal .
 - Yeah , it 's no big deal .
 - It sounds like a big deal .
 Can we talk about it later ?
 Adam , how is your dad ?
 Uh , I don 't know . I haven 't seen him for a while .
 My parents are separated .
 Yeah . Yeah , I heard , sorry .
 Well , my mum 's having a baby with Ola 's dad , which is kind of weird because we used to date , and now we 're like actual siblings .
 Maybe don 't tell people that .
 Pretty weird , dude .
 How do you feel about it ?
 New family , baby , and stuff ?
 It 's a big adjustment
 ' cause I 'm an only child , but I 'm trying to be more adult .
 Yeah , I think Ola 's finding it hard too .
 After her mum died and her sister 's gone off to university , it 's just been her and her dad , so ... [ sniffs ] ... maybe you can help each other out .
 - Did I say the wrong thing ? - [ Otis ] No .
 That was very astute , actually .

 Hello , hello , hello , hi !
 That was fun . Are you guys going back to Ruby 's now ?
 I 've never actually been to Ruby 's house .
 Really ? But you guys have been seeing each other for a while .
 Anyway , this was nice .
 Adam , text me once you 've watched the spin- off , yeah ?
 - Buh- bye .
 - Oh !
 Oh , uh , bye . Okay .
 I think we were walking in the same direction , but ...
 Yeah .

 Ooh !
 Oh , do you wanna feel the baby kick ?
 - Really ? - Yeah , right there .
 Oh .

 Oh .
 It 's stopped . It was so strong though .
 Oh .
 Maybe it 's gone back to sleep .
 What do you think about Thor ?
 As what ?
 A name , if it 's a boy .
 [ both laughing ]
 Why do you laugh ?
 [ Jakob laughs ]
 I don 't know .
 - Thor ? - Yeah .
 - Thor ? - Thor .
 That 's the name of the superhero with the pumped- up muscles .
 A bit silly , isn 't it ?
 It was my father 's name .
 [ gasps ]
 It 's a very common name in Sweden .
 No big deal .
 [ Jakob sighs ]
 I 'm sorry .
 Yes , I can think about
 Thor , sure .
 Thor Nyman .
 That 's a strong boy 's name , huh ?
 Why does a boy 's name need to be strong ?
 Well , you said yourself , the kick was strong .
 Yes , but the baby can be any sex and have a strong kick .
 And why do you just assume the baby 's going to have your surname ?
 [ chuckles ] It ain 't gonna be Milburn ' cause that 's your ex- husband 's name .
 No , but it could be my maiden name , which is Franklin .
 You gonna change your name back to Franklin ?
 I don 't know !
 Probably not , but I haven 't thought about it yet .
 Well , then it makes more sense if the baby 's a Nyman .
 It 's easier to stick to traditions , I think .
 [ Jakob laughs ]
 I 'm actually surprised that you think like this , Jakob .
 It 's so old- fashioned .
 I mean , next you 'll be telling me that you vote Conservative .
 I don 't vote .
 What do you mean , you don 't vote ?
 - Never have . - You don 't vote ?
 I think this would look good in our bedroom .
 I think that would look good back in the box .
 [ laughs ]
 You 're funny .
 [ laughs ]
 I 'll be okay from here , so ...
 How come you never invite me to your house ?
 I don 't " never invite " you ... [ chuckles ]
 [ scoffs ]
 My house is shit , okay ?
 People assume I live in a big , fancy house , but I don 't , okay ?
 So I don 't invite people over .
 Ever ?

 - Well , I 'd like to see it .
 - [ sighs ]

 Oh , fine !
 Would you like to see my house ?
 Why , yes , I would .
 So annoying sometimes , Otis .
 [ Adam ] I don 't think you should go to Nigeria .
 [ Eric ] Why ?
 [ Adam ] It 's dangerous to be gay there .
 It 's dangerous to be gay anywhere .
 It 's a part of me . I wanna go .

 - [ man ]
 Oh !
 - [ Otis grunts ] - Sorry , mate .
 [ sniffs ]
 Ah !
 [ Ruby ] Where 's Mum ?
 Can 't waste a Hobnob .
 [ inhales sharply ]
 Oh , your mum got called in for a cover shift at the hospital .
 Why didn 't you call me ? I could 've come back .
 I didn 't wanna ruin your date .
 Speaking of , do I finally get to meet the famous Otis ?
 Otis , my dad , Roland .
 Dad , Otis . Hello !
 Hi . It 's nice to meet you .
 Okay , you 've met now , so thanks for helping .
 Off you go .
 [ Roland ] Go ? But he just got here .
 Otis , stay for a bit .
 Let 's ... let 's hang .
 No , Dad !
 Please don 't say hang .
 Don 't worry . I 'll put on my dressing gown .
 - How about that ? - That sounds great .
 [ doorbell ringing ]
 That 'll be my weed dealer .
 [ exhales sharply ]
 [ whimsical music playing ]
 [ Jackson ] Did the uniform really not fit , or do you just not wanna wear it ?
 Shit , sorry . Was that rude of me ?
 [ Cal ] No , it 's fine .
 Uh ...
 Wasn 't the right fit for me .
 I don 't like clothes clinging to my body , but I don 't really have a choice .
 A lot of people don 't really get it .
 Who doesn 't get it ?
 The whole world , Jackson .
 I used to get changed in the abandoned toilet block so the idiot popular girls wouldn 't say shit about my body .
 Other queer kids would change there too .
 It was more comfortable , but it 's gone now , so ...
 That 's so messed up .
 - Yeah . - Do you want me to talk to Hope about it ?
 Thanks , but I can fight my own battles .
 - You 're not head boy anymore , remember ? - Oh shit . Yeah , I forgot .
 [ both laugh ]
 [ Jackson chuckles ]
 [ Jackson ] This is the first time I 've felt calm in so long .
 [ Cal ] Yeah . It 's quite nice , right ?
 [ emotional music playing ]
 [ dog barking ]
 Going on holiday , Mum ?
 No ! I need it for my appeal to get Elsie back , which I wouldn 't have to do if it wasn 't for you !

 For God 's sake . Mum , please .
 Okay , I know I 've hurt you . I was just doing what I thought was right .
 I didn 't want Elsie to get hurt like Sean and I did
 ' cause you have an illness .
 - What ? - You do ! I 'm sorry !
 I know it 's not your fault , and I know you 're trying , but you haven 't beaten it yet .
 You might not for a really long time .
 That doesn 't mean I won 't always love you .
 ' Cause I 'll always love you , Mum .
 Even if you hate me .
 Tell Isaac I 'll be back in a couple of days for my painting .
 [ sighs ]
 [ " Never My Love " by the Association playing ]
 [ Roland ] My fingers aren 't nimble anymore .
 [ chuckles ]
 Why don 't you stick around for a smoke ?
 [ Jeffrey ] Sure . Need a break from the old ball- and- chain .
 Dad started smoking last year because it helps with the pain , but we couldn 't get it on prescription , which is bullshit . [ exhales sharply ]
 Do you want a puff , Rubes ?
 No , Dad . Who 's gonna help you when you fall out of bed again ?
 - Otis ? - I 'm fine , thank you .
 You are such an irresponsible parent !
 [ scoffs ]
 Young people .
 [ inhales ] They 're so clean- cut these days .
 [ Jeffrey ] Ah , yes . Thank you , Roland .
 [ groans ]
 You got trouble at home , Jeffrey ?
 Yeah , there was an incident .
 Our cat Jonathan died , and now Cynthia wants to ...
 Sorry , kids . ... have sex all the time .
 It 's constant .
 I 'm not as young as I used to be .
 None of us are as young as we used to be , but you gotta enjoy it while you still can
 [ Roland ]
 ' cause ... [ chuckles ] ... life 's a bitch .
 It gets us all in the end .
 Dad , don 't say that .
 Rubes doesn 't like it when I 'm being nihilistic .
 I 'm sorry , darlin ' .
 I 'll rein it in .
 She 's such a good girl , so kind to me and her mum .
 Which is why it 's nice to see her happy since she 's been dating you .
 [ chuckles ]
 Always going on about you .
 [ chuckles ]
 Otis this , and Otis that .
 Oh my God , Dad ! Shut up !
 What ? It 's normal !
 I used to be like that about your mum when we first met .
 Yeah , I used to be like that about Cynthia too .
 [ sighs ]
 To be young .
 Yeah , it was so nice to be young .
 [ Roland snoring ]
 [ Jeffrey chuckling ]
 Your dad 's such a lightweight .
 - [ Roland snoring ]
 - [ Ruby groans ]
 [ Jeffrey chuckles ]
 [ Otis , Jeffrey grunt ]
 [ Roland snores ]
 [ Ruby sighs ]
 - Do you wanna stay over ? - Thank you , but I should get home .
 I should probably get home too .
 Sorry about your cat .
 Thanks . Yeah , he was a great cat .
 A change in libido is a common side- effect of grief .
 For some people , it 's a coping strategy .
 Cynthia and me could never have kids .
 She really wanted them , but they just never stuck , you know .
 So Jonathan was kinda like her son .
 Thought she 'd fall apart without him but been the opposite .
 She hasn 't even cried .
 Grief hits people in different ways .
 Maybe that 's why she wants to be intimate with you all the time , to avoid feeling the sadness .
 Yeah , maybe .
 Hey , you 're kinda like an old man in a kid 's body . [ chuckles ]
 [ Otis chuckles ]
 Yeah , I get that a lot .

 [ knocking at door ]
 [ Maeve ] Mum said you 've painted me ?
 Yeah .
 I was gonna give it to you when we were still friends , but , um ...
 Well , it would be a bit creepy now .
 Can I see it ?
 Yeah . It 's , uh , just under those .
 Okay .
 This looks nothing like me .
 - Mum 's is pretty good though .
 - Yeah , the props were her idea .
 Thank you for getting her to stay .
 I didn 't do anything .
 [ Maeve clears throat ]
 I wanted to say that I do know you , by the way .
 You said I didn 't , but
 I do .
 I know you still cut the crusts off your toast .
 That you bite your nails when you 're nervous , sometimes when you 're feeling shy .
 That you could run intellectual rings around anybody , but you don 't because you 're basically a very good person .
 Which is why you give me a hard time , more than anyone else I 've ever met , because you know that 's what 's gonna make me feel seen .
 Every time I 'm around you , all my cells are fizzy and alive , and everything feels hopeful .

 I just wish that I could take back what I did because ...
 I 'm afraid I 'm not gonna have you in my life anymore .
 You 'll always be in my life .
 But if you ever lie to me again , I will cut your ball sack off .
 Okay ?
 Noted .
 See you at breakfast .
 [ sentimental music playing ]
 All right ?
 - What took you so long , lover boy ?
 - Fucking hell !
 Cynthia , stop !
 I can 't keep having sex with you .
 I 'm really tired !
 And I think we need to talk about Jonathan .
 I don 't think that I can .
 Why not , love ?
 [ inhales , sobs ] Because ...
 Because it 's too painful .
 - I know , Cynth .
 - [ crying ]
 - I know .
 - [ crying ]

 [ acoustic guitar music playing ] ... [ chuckles ]

 Minneapolis- ah !
 [ phone buzzing ]
 [ singer vocalizing ]
 [ door opens , closes ]
 Hey .
 - Hey . How was your night ? - [ song ends ]
 [ chuckles ]
 It was fun . It was a bit odd but nice .
 Did you know Adam watches the Kardashians ?
 No , but it doesn 't surprise me .
 [ Ola chuckles ]
 Hey , I am sorry about earlier .
 I 'm an only child .
 I 'm not very good at sharing my space , but I am working on it .
 I know this must be hard for you , too , so you can borrow my records whenever .
 Thanks , Otis . That means a lot .
 So , um , you and Ruby are getting pretty serious , then ?
 Maybe .
 [ " Tender " by Blur playing ] [ phone beeps ]

 [ phone ringing ]
 [ sighs ]
 - Hey .
 - [ Ruby ] My dad was embarrassing tonight .
 I 'm so sorry about that .


 Yeah , he is kind of great , isn 't he ?
 [ breathes deeply ]
 Anyway , thanks for helping me out . You 're the best .

 I 'm glad .
 Okay .
 Night , then , Otis .

 I love you .
 Oh .
 That 's nice .
 Good night , then . [ splutters ]
