 00 : 00 : 03, 765 -- > 00 : 00 : 06, 065 Oh , this is amazing . I wish I had a playhouse like this when I was a kid .
 I mean , my dad did buy the house next door for us to play in . Really ? You never had a playhouse ?
 No .

 I 'm gonna hook up the garden hose , so it has running water .
 Why does it need running water ?
 Same reason it 's got electricity : Bernadette and I both work , and we 're overcompensating .
 This reminds me of a traditional Amish barn raising .
 With everyone pitching in .
 How exactly are you pitching in ?
 I don 't hear anyone else giving facts about traditional Amish barn raising .
 The rest of us are pitching in with hammers and nails .
 Well , facts are my nails , and my voice is the hammer which pounds them through the wood of your skull .
 Well , that is how it feels .
 Hey , uh , can you pass me that drill ?
 Yeah , fun fact about Amish barn raising -- they don 't use any power tools .
 - Amy , make him stop . - No .
 If he tires himself out now , he 'll sleep better tonight .
 Hey , Howie , can you give me a hand ?
 I need to get some work done , and the kids are climbing all over me .
 You know what ? I 'll watch them . - You sure ?
 - But I was just about to tell everyone why they 're called Pennsylvania Dutch when they really hail from Germany .
 Yep .
 Thanks .
 So , what do you think ? Pretty cool , huh ?
 And when our kids outgrow it , we can Airbnb it to other people 's babies .
 Funny .
 You all right ? Sorry , I haven 't had a second to myself .
 So let me just go back inside , finish my report , brush my teeth , change out of my pajamas , make a sandwich , and then I 'll come out here and laugh at your joke .
 Ooh .
 As long as you 're making sandwiches ...
 You can laugh at that one later , too .
 All right , I 've kept you in suspense long enough .
 " Dutch " is a bastardization of the word " Deutsch , " meaning German .
 What 's German for " annoying " ?

 President Siebert , you wanted to see me ? Hey .
 There 's my guy !
 You sound like my wife just before she asked me to go to Coachella .
 No , this is gonna be way more fun than Coachella .
 More fun than heatstroke ?
 Good luck .
 So , there are some funds left in the general administrative grant , and I need somebody to decide how we should disburse them .
 Really ?
 W- Wow , what an honor .
 Thank you . So how do I decide who gets the money ?
 How do you decide anything ? Think about it with your brain , and then say it with your mouth .
 Yeah , right , sure .
 Uh , so , after I decide , do I then submit it to you for approval , or ... ?
 No . You decide , you approve , and then you pride yourself on a job well done .
 That 's a lot of responsibility .
 Well , if I didn 't think you were up to the task , you wouldn 't have been fifth on my list .
 Thank you .
 I- I 'll get started right away . And I look forward to hearing nothing about it .
 I will keep you posted .
 Hey , thank you guys again for helping out yesterday .
 - No problem . - That was really fun . - It fun .
 But I am sore . You didn 't lift a finger .
 No , but I narrated the entire event , and I am paying for it today .
 - Gentlemen .
 - Hey . - Hi . Leonard , do I detect a little swagger in your step ?
 Mm , possibly . Well , stop . It doesn 't suit you .
 - What 's going on ?
 - Well , Siebert put me in charge of handing out the last bit of the administrative funds , and I have sole discretion .

 Ooh !
 Looks like Christmas came early .
 First thing on my list is a golden umbrella , ' cause Leonard 's gonna make it rain !
 Uh , hold on , I 'm not just gonna hand out money .
 There 's a procedure you need to follow .
 I believe he 's referring to the traditional " kissing of the buttocks . "
 Should we form a line , or just do it like we 're bobbing for apples ?
 Cute , but President Siebert trusted me with this , and I 'm taking it seriously .
 If you have a legitimate request , you can submit it to me in writing , and I 'll evaluate it based on its merits .
 Sure , sure . Is " Jet Ski " one word or two ?
 Hofstadter !
 Heard Siebert put you in charge of the administrative fund .
 Can 't think of a better guy for the job .
 I think he 's done this before .
 Leonard , I know you and I have a ... oh , troubled history , but I hope that when I make my request you 'll give me a fair shot .
 Of course .
 See ? That 's why I like about this guy : integrity .
 Bring it in !
 I just put something in your pocket .
 It 's good at El Pollo Locos .
 Halley , leave your brother 's dirty diaper alone .
 Put that down . That is not a hat . That is not a hat !
 Oh !
 - Okay . Everybody in the sink .
 - Oh .
 Bad news , Howie . I 'm gonna be stuck at work for a while .
 Oh , that 's terrible . Hang in there .
 I 'll be home as soon as I can .
 Ah ...
 He deserves better .
 No , I 'm going to reconsider . Your request was denied .
 I don 't care if it helps you think ; you don 't need a koi pond in your office .
 Well , you should have thought about that you bought the koi !
 Wow .
 That was a little rough . Well , I have to be .
 Everyone assumes I 'm just gonna give them whatever they want .
 Hmm . But you 're not , are you ?
 No , I 'm not . I mean , look at this .
 An espresso machine ? I don 't think so . Denied !
 Wow , I really like this side of you .
 Really ? Yeah , just so decisive .
 Well , check this out . A standing desk . Denied !
 Oh !
 If you want to stand , do it on your own time , 'cause I 'm the boss .
 Yeah , you are .
 - Hello . - Hey . - Hey .
 Leonard , I just wanted to congratulate you on how well you are managing this grant money .
 - What do you want ? Nothing .
 I just came by to pay you a compliment . Nice try . The answer 's no .
 To what ? I 'm not asking you for anything . All I need for my job is right here .
 Hmm ? This is my office . Which makes for a great commute .
 Home , work , home .
 I 'm still working -- I 'm just working from home .
 You know , if it 's that easy , then why does Leonard have to drive you to work every day ?
 Because I like the frozen yogurt machine in the cafeteria .
 Ooh , I suppose I could use a frozen yogurt machine ...
 Denied !
 Oh , you should have seen him -- denying things left and right . It was so sexy .
 ' Course , I made a request he did deny .
 Uh- huh .
 Are you listening to me ? Yeah , sure . You slept with your husband .
 What is going on with you ?
 It 's not a big thing .
 Have you ever told Leonard a little white lie ? Mm .
 Well , he thinks I 've seen every one of the movies , but I 've really only seen the one with the gold robot .
 - That could be any of them . - Exactly .
 I 've been telling Howie that I 've had to work late the past couple nights , but really ,
 I 've just been hiding out in Howie 's playhouse .
 Does that make me awful ? Awful ? No .
 Uh , strange ? Yes .
 Sad ? A little , yes .
 It 's just that work 's been crazy , and the minute I get home , I have two kids hanging on me , and sometimes I don 't want babies pulling my hair and pinching my belly fat .
 That 'd be a good slogan for a condom company .
 I love my kids , but that hour to myself just makes me feel human again .
 So , you go home and sit alone in a toy house in the backyard ?
 Yeah !
 Oh , Dr. Hofstadter , did you have a chance to look over my proposal ?
 - I did , and your research is fascinating .
 I had no idea that crows were that smart . Do they really hold grudges ?
 They do . One of them escaped from my behavioral study a year ago .
 I can 't prove it 's him , but something craps on my car every day .
 Well , l- look , I only have enough money to fund one request , but your project is definitely in the running .
 Okay , but , uh , when do you think you might make a decision ? Because I have to upgrade their cages before they learn how to open the locks .
 When I came in to my lab this morning , they suddenly got silent .
 I think they 're planning something .
 Um , soon .
 I 've narrowed it down to three projects .
 Ooh , is mine one of them ? Actually , yeah .
 The software in the telescope room hasn 't been upgraded in years , and it seems like it might be time .
 Whoa , whoa , whoa !
 So you 're just gonna give the money to your friend ? I smell a rat .
 I work with rats , too . That might be me .
 I 'm not just giving it to my friend , Barry . Your proposal is also in the mix .
 Wait , so those are the three ? You 're not even considering mine ?
 Why , because they 're PhDs and I 'm just an engineer ?
 No , because they wrote detailed proposals , and you sent a YouTube clip of the guy from saying , " Show me the money ! "
 All right , Hofstadter , what 's it gonna be ? Which project are you gonna pick ?
 Yeah , come on , Leonard . - Tell us now .
 - But , remember , crows aren 't the only ones who can hold a grudge .
 Look , all three of your proposals have a lot of merit .
 I just want to make sure I 'm making the right decision .
 I can tell you 're stressed . If it helps , I withdraw my proposal . It doesn 't help .
 Fine . Then I 'm back in the mix .
 Show me the money !
 Okay , I- I just -- I need everyone to back off .
 I 'm in charge here , and I 'll decide when I 'm ready to decide .
 When will that be ? A day , a week . I don 't know !
 - Where are you going ? - I don 't know that either !
 Ooh . Someone 's making decisions .
 I 'm reviewing these proposals . Yeah . 'Cause you 're the boss man , telling people what 's what .
 I like it .
 It 's just so hard ! All- all three of these proposals have merit .
 How do I choose ? Well , not with that voice .
 There has got to be a right decision based on empirical evidence .
 Look , I made pros and cons lists , and then I came up with three different scoring systems to determine the best project .
 I just don 't know what scoring system to use .
 So I 'm working on a meta- scoring system to score the scoring systems , but the math is really complicated .
 You want me to walk you through it ?
 - Cheers .
 - Cheers .
 Turn that off . Are you trying to get us caught ?
 Oh .
 So , I 've narrowed it down to three worthwhile projects , but I only have the money to fund one of them .
 Lucky for you , I have a solution .
 I can 't wait .
 You free up more money and I fund all of them .
 Mm , no .
 Or -- hear me out -- yes .
 That way , e- everybody 's happy . You can 't make everybody happy .
 - I think I can .
 - You can 't . - Well , actually ... - You 're making me unhappy .
 Okay , what would you do ?
 I 'd find some sap and put him in charge so I wouldn 't have to be the bad guy .
 That 's a really good id -- Oh .
 Whatcha doin ' ?
 You scared me .
 I 'll ask again .
 What- cha doin ' ?
 Nothing . Really ?
 You and Bernadette aren 't doing stuff without me ?
 What ? No ! Why would you even say that ?
 You know how your talent is getting just drunk enough to have a good time without being hungover the next day ?
 Thank you .
 Well , mine is knowing when I 'm being excluded .
 So spill . I 'm- I 'm just running some errands .
 Yeah ?
 With a bag full of wine ? I ...
 Got to stay hydrated .
 Try again . Okay , look , I 'm sorry .
 We did not mean to leave you out .
 Bernadette has been feeling fried at home , so we ended up hanging out in Halley 's playhouse .
 All right ?
 Like a secret club ?
 No !
 Just , like , a place to spend time that we don 't tell anyone else about .
 And what would be a shorter way of saying that ?
 Secret club .
 Well , you really hurt my feelings .
 What can I do to make it up to you ?
 I 'm in a secret club !
 Shh !
 Is there some sort of humiliating initiation ? ' Cause I would literally do anything .
 Leonard , you 've been losing to me in three- dimensional chess for many years .
 You know what would be neat ?
 If this was some sort of long con and one day you say , " Let 's make this interesting , " put money on it , and reveal that you actually know what you 're doing .
 A very long con indeed . Checkmate .
 Sorry . I 'm distracted .
 Ooh , aren 't you the hustler .
 No matter who I give the funds to , someone is gonna be upset with me .
 Do you really care if people are angry at you ? - Of course .
 - Interesting .
 Why don 't you go to the store and get me some tapioca pudding or I 'm gonna be angry at you .
 No .
 So it comes and goes ?
 How do you not care what people think of you ? It 's easy .
 I mean , not " beating you at chess " easy , but what is ?
 Wait , you can make this decision .
 You don 't care if you upset people . You can pick for me .
 I certainly could . - Oh , great .
 - But I won 't .
 I think this is a learning opportunity for you .
 Sheldon , come on . Oh , I 'm sorry . Did I upset you ?
 - Yes . - Ask me how I feel about that .
 So where does Leonard think you are ? Oh , I told him I was at yoga .
 Well , you are stretching the truth . Yeah .
 Where does Sheldon think are ?
 Oh , Sheldon 's kind of like a dog -- he doesn 't really think about me when I 'm gone , but he 's so happy when I show up .
 Ooh . Who wants an Easy- Bake quesadilla ?
 Me ! Ooh , hot .
 Shh .
 Thanks for letting me come over and hang .
 So Leonard still hasn 't made a decision yet ? No .
 And I 've really been laying on the guilt . Did you break out the sad eyes ?
 You mean these bad boys ?
 What do we do ? We 're just gonna have to wait till they go back inside .
 Okay , okay . Can we very quietly open that second bottle of ...
 Hey , don 't freak out , but I think there 's someone in your playhouse . Oh .
 Yeah , that 's just Bernadette .
 She 's been hiding out in there all week . Really ?
 Why ?
 I don 't know .
 She 's been a little overwhelmed at work . And , frankly , me and the kids are a lot . She just ... needs some downtime .
 And you just pretend like you don 't know ?
 Sure . That 's how marriage works . Three years ago ...
 I told her I got life insurance , and I totally didn 't .
 Someday , she 's gonna find out .
 I 'm gonna say ,
 " Ha- ha ! I know you 've been hiding in the playhouse . "
 Why don 't you just get the life insurance ? Whose side are you on ?

 Can you hear what they 're saying ? Shh , I 'm trying .
 Huh .
 Sounds like Penny 's in there , too .
 Seriously , Leonard , you didn 't pick my project ? I 'm sorry , Raj . - Did you go with Crow Lady ?
 - No . You gave the money to Kripke ?
 I did not . Wait , I 'm confused .
 I thought there were only three projects in contention . There were .
 But , at the last minute , someone submitted an application for a pretty cool europium- doped laser , and they made a very compelling case .
 What was the case ? Oh , that it was me and I wanted it .
 You- you can 't do that .
 You can 't just fund your own project .
 Uh , it turns out I can , and I did . Interesting .
 What about not wanting everybody to be mad at you ?
 Well , I realized that , no matter what decision I made , people were gonna be mad at me .
 And this way , I get a laser .
 That is the most selfish thing you 've ever done . I 'm proud of you .

 - And I don 't care .
 - Yes , you do . Yeah , I do .

 The europium laser is so cool .
 It has a four- level f- f transition which provides for high power output , and its quantum efficiency is off the charts .
 What are you going to use it for ? I have no idea .
 Leonard , there 's a crow on your roof .
 I see it .
 Is that one of Dr. Lee 's crows ?
 It has a tag on its leg .
 Don 't make any sudden moves .
 Smart . Let 's stand perfectly still and ...
 He 's the one you want !
