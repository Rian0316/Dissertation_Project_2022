 00 : 00 : 00, 031 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 139 Previously on AMC 's " Better Call Saul " ... I 'm curious about your strategy .
 I don 't intend to take it easy on your brother
 - just because he 's a lawyer .
 - Of course not .
 The PPD was Chuck 's idea .
 - What are you gonna do ?
 - He just wants my law license .
 I 'm not gonna let you fight this on your own .
 - My watch .
 - Allow me .
 Hector 's your competition .
 It 's not in my interest for him to die at this time .
 You want to disrupt his supply line .
 I would not stand in your way .







 Ah .



 Ah .















 Ah .


 Sì , señor .

 Ah .




 Whoa .








 ¿ Eh ?


 Ahhhh .











 Whoa .

 Ahhh .








 Guau .








 Mm .







 Mm ?





























 Pop ?
 Hey , honey .
 Almost didn 't recognize the number .
 I 'm sorry .
 They changed my hours up at work .
 I 'm still gettin ' used to it .
 How are you two ?
 We 're great .
 Did it go okay ?
 Yeah , yeah , thanks to those movers you got .
 All I had to do was watch .
 And , Pop , this house ...
 It 's good ?
 It 's great .
 Kaylee loves her new school .
 The neighborhood 's friendly .
 We feel safe .
 That 's good .
 Mike , I don 't know how to thank you .
 Well , you don 't have to .
 I 'm just glad you 're enjoying it .
 Do you want to come over for dinner ?
 Tonight ? Sure .
 I 'm making lasagna . There 'll be plenty .

 Well , that 's very sweet , but I don 't want to put you out .
 Pop- pop , come over !
 There 's someone here who wants to see you .







 Ice cream !
 Oh , is she snoozing ?
 Close .
 Ice cream ?
 I shoulda let well enough alone .
 Well , I can 't understand it .
 According to the map , we were supposed to be taking a shortcut .
 I 'm good . - You sure ?
 - Yeah .
 I 'll have his .
 Oh , I don 't think so .
 Maybe we can get a lift .




 Hey !
 What 's the matter ?
 There 's some guys hanging around the truck .
 Air Raid Wardens ? No , these is funny- lookin ' guys .
 What do you mean " funny- lookin ' " ?
 I mean funny- lookin ' , like fish .
 Who are you kidding ?
 What do you mean " like fish " ?
 - They got scales .
 - Hey .
 - Where ?
 - All over 'em !
 You okay ?
 Oh , yeah , I 'm ...
 I 'm fine .
 They 're off a flyin ' saucer , off a sputnik . Ohh , look !
 They 've seen us !
 Let 's get outta here !
 They 're from outer space .
 They 're off a flying saucer !


 Receipt .





 Eh .
 Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos .
 May I take your order ?
 ¿ Tu jefe esta aquí ?
 Ah ...
 ¿ Donde esta ?
 Uh , men 's room is over there on the left , sir .
 Cabrón , I need to see your boss .
 Okay . Well , I 'm ...
 I 'm the assistant manager .
 The manager 's actually not here today .
 Not the manager ... the boss .
 - You mean Mr. Fring ?
 - Mr. Fring .
 O- okay , well , he 's not here at the moment .
 Uh , I 'm sure I could help you with whatever you need .
 I need Fring .
 Well , like I said , he 's not here , uh , and I don 't really know when he 'll be back .
 I can ... I can take a message .

 I 'll wait .

 You ... you don 't have to do that .
 I 'd be happy to take a message .
 Uh , I 'm sure Mr. Fring wouldn 't want to keep you waiting .

 Uh , okay , sir , if you ... if you don 't mind , there are oth ... there are other customers .
 Uh , s- sorry about that .
 Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos .
 Uh , may I take your order ?
 Yeah , can I get a 12- piece bucket , uh , with jumbo fries ... and , uh ...
 - You said the 12- piece ?
 - Yeah , the 12- piece .
 - Uh- huh .
 - Okay .
 Uh , excuse me , sir .
 You can 't light that in here .
 Sir !
 There 's no smoking on the premises .
 Please , sir , look ... look at the signs .
 No fumar .

 You can 't .
 That 's ... it 's a ... it 's a health- code violation .


 - Uh , sir , it 's employees only .
 - We have to go , okay ? Let 's go .

 Sir !

 Sir !



 Sir , you 're not allowed back here .


 Gus Fring is a pillar of our local business community , and not just for underwriting our travel raffle , but for making the best damn chicken in town !
 - Gus .
 - Thank you .
 Thank you .
 Well , uh , gentlemen , ladies , uh , I- I hope to never need your services ...
 I mean , no offense , but ... if I ever did , it 's good to know that ...







 Yes ?
 I 'll be right there .


 I want you all to go home now .
 You will be compensated for your full shifts .
 Normal schedule tomorrow .
 Go now .
 We are closed for today .


 Mr. Fring , y- you sure you want to be left with these guys ?
 I 'm fine , Lyle .
 - You go home .
 - Should I call someone ?
 No .
 That will not be necessarily .
 Truly .
 Are you sure ?
 Please do as I ask .
 I 'll see you tomorrow .







 He 's waiting in the office .
 I know where he is .
 Don Hector .
 Took you long enough .


 Don Hector , mine is a cartel business , but it is mine .
 And it is legitimate .
 My employees are civilians .
 Your actions here today have endangered them , my interests , and those of the cartel .
 I am the cartel .
 And from now on , you are my mule .
 You are going to bring my product north .
 Mierda .
 Ah .

 I understand that your supply line has been compromised , and this is most unfortunate .
 However , my trucks are already at maximum capacity .
 Make room .
 Don Hector , you must understand that I answer to Juan Bolsa .
 You want to cry to Bolsa , cry to Bolsa .
 Or , hell , Eladio .

 Adding more product will threaten the reliability of the entire operation .
 May I ask ... did Don Eladio approve this ?
 I approve this .


 You 're doin ' it .

 You gonna let me out of here ?
 Hello ?
 Tell him we 're square . What ?
 No .




 Excuse me , everyone .
 Could you all please take a moment and join me out here ?
 Please , come .
 Come , come , come .



 I would , uh ,
 I would like to apologize to each and every one of you who , yesterday , had to endure the behavior of those men .
 It was unacceptable .
 Despite the difficult circumstances , you all acquitted yourselves impeccably .
 That said , if any of you wish to seek counseling due to lingering trauma , speak with me privately , and it will be arranged .
 Also , you will all be receiving 24 hours of overtime , as I am sure , in one way or another , each of you brought this incident home with you .
 Uh , yes , Lyle ?
 Mr. Fring , uh ... who were those guys ?
 Well , some of you know , that many years ago ,
 I opened my first Los Pollos Hermanos in Michoacán .
 Shortly thereafter , those same men showed up .
 They wanted money . And I- I am ...
 I 'm ashamed to say that I paid them .
 You see , in that place , at that time , if I wished to conduct my business ...
 I had no choice . but yesterday ...
 yesterday , they came here .
 Here .
 They intimidated my customers .
 They threatened my employees .
 And , again , they wanted money .
 Now , my friends , I- I must confess that I almost gave them what they wanted .
 But then , I thought , " No .
 " No .
 " This is America . "
 Here , the righteous have no reason to fear .
 Here , those men have no power .
 And when they saw that I had no fear of them , they ran like the cowards they are .
 Back across the border . They will not return .
 We will move on from this .
 My friends ,
 I promise you ... that together , we will prosper .
 All right .



 Yes , hi .
 I 'm still here .
 Really ? Uh , are you sure ? Sure .
 Gotcha .
 Sorry for bothering you .
 Hi .
 I 'm calling because we had an appointment with you guys for ,
 I think , Wednesday ?
 I 'll be honest with you ...
 I can barely read my own darn handwriting .
 My mistake .
 Okay .
 Have a nice day .

 Hello . I 'm calling to confirm an appointment for Charles McGill .
 Yes , it 's 215 San Cristobal Road ...
 McGill , with an " M. "
 A door ?
 Oh .
 Okay .
 I thought it was you guys .
 Guess I was wrong .
 Thanks , anyway .

 Hi !
 I 'm calling about an appointment for Charles McGill .
 Well , that 's why I 'm calling .
 I think it 's for this week , but ...
 Good thing my head 's attached to my neck , right ?
 San Cristobal ... that 's right .
 Yes , that 's it !
 2 : 30 tomorrow .
 Great !
 So , uh , we 're gonna need to cancel that .
 Yeah .
 I will .
 Thank you . Bye .

 Ohh , poor Frisky .
 Mm .
 Pomeranians can be difficult ... all that hair .
 I know .
 So , Mrs. Vallance , does Thursday 11 : 30 work ?
 That 's right .
 No .
 Really ?
 Martin 's Handyman and Repair ... 2 : 30 tomorrow .
 Thank you .
 How many calls did that take ?
 I lost track .
 Is that it ?
 Yeah . I 'm nearly done .
 I 'm just giving it a remorse pass .
 Well , remorse is important .



 " Destroyed property . "
 Hmm .
 I 'd try ...
 " damaged " the victim 's property instead of " destroyed " property .
 - See if you can 't get away with that .
 - Yeah .

 Boom . Oh . That 's nice .

 I mean it , by the way .
 What ?
 Thank you .
 Seriously .
 You 're welcome seriously .
 - I better get back to it .
 - Yeah .
 Are you ... ?
 You 're absolutely sure you got the right guy for this ?
 Oh , uh , the crème de la crème .






 Martin 's Repair ?
 - Yeah .
 Mr. McGill ?
 - Good afternoon .
 If you don 't mind wiping your shoes ?
 It 's this way .
 Mind ... mind the step here .

 Uh , as you 'll see , the frame is boarded over , but the , uh , the door itself is intact .
 The damage is mainly to the doorjamb and the casing .
 There 's another step up here .


 - Ohh . - Mm- hmm .

 - Break- in ?
 - That 's right .
 Went after your copper wire , from the look of it .
 There was a time ... remember ?
 When we could leave our doors unlocked .
 I certainly do .
 Well ...
 Where do I plug in ? You don 't .
 - No ?
 - No .
 Didn 't you ...
 I believe my assistant was very clear with your dispatcher ... no electricity , due to a condition that was explained in some detail .


 No problem .
 Good thing I charged my battery .
 I 'd be going at it like Fred Flintstone , otherwise .

 I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I understood there would be no power tools of any kind .
 What ?
 A screwdriver and a hammer ?
 Turns a morning job into two days with me , myself , and Bengay .
 But ... it 's your call .

 I suppose ...
 Very well , if ...




 You seem to be making fast work of it .
 That 's good .
 That 's good .
 Um , okay , what I 'll do , I think , is , uh ...





 Very good .
 Oh , yeah .
 Nice .
 Great .
 Yep , nice .
 At some point , we should probably discuss the rule of thirds , but , otherwise , these , uh ...
 Oh , wow .
 Yep .
 A gas lantern sitting on a stack of friggin ' Financial Times .
 Now , that tells the whole story .
 These are museum quality .
 You , my friend , are the Ansel Adams of covert photography .
 And that other thing ?



 How 'd you get it ?
 Address book on his desk .
 Right .
 So ... what 'dya think of him ?
 I mean , speak freely .
 You couldn 't possibly offend me .
 He 's a bit of a prick , right ?

 Nothing ?
 Seriously ? All right .
 Can 't even dish the dirt with this guy .
 Isn 't our business concluded ?
 Yeah , even Steven .
 - I mean , you did fix the door , right ?
 - Yeah .
 Y- you did a reasonably good job of it ? - Because , otherwise , he 'll be ...
 - He won 't be grumbling to anyone . That 's all I 'm asking .
 I did it right .
 Thank you .
 Nice to fix something for once .
 Hell , if that 's how you feel ,
 I got a leaky toilet back at the office .
 All right .
 If you ever need anything from my end ...
 Hasta luego .







 May we talk ?
 You can park it over there .


 You sent back the payment we agreed upon .
 What I did , I didn 't do for you .
 The man .
 The one killed for helping the truck driver .
 If I may make an observation ...
 Perhaps you are trying to correct something which cannot be corrected .
 It 's not the kind of thing I want to take money for .
 But the fact remains that your actions benefited me more than you can know .
 That 's your business .
 I 'm just glad to have Salamanca out of my head .

 Well , perhaps , in the future ... you will consider working for me .

 Could be .
 That 'd depend on the work .

 Would you care to know why ...
 I stopped you from killing Hector ?
 Like you said ... it wasn 't in your interest .
 A bullet to the head would have been far too humane .



 Jimmy .
 Howard .

 Jimmy .

 Howard .
 - Kim .
 - Chuck .
 Kim .




 Good afternoon .
 Oh !
 Good .
 Mr. McGill , does this work for you ?
 It 'll have to do .
 Thank you .
 I assume everyone left their cellphones and so on at reception .
 Yes , indeed .
 And you 'll let me know if you need a break or anything else ? I will .
 Thank you , Ms. Hay .
 You know ...
 I was actually speaking to my husband about your condition .
 Oh , yes ? I had an aunt .
 She 's no longer with us .
 She went to church every Sunday , but when the boys ' choir sang , she would absolutely have to leave .

 Something about the frequency of their voices really did a number on her .
 - Well , that is a shame .
 - Indeed .
 All right .
 Let 's get down to it .
 We are here to finalize the Pre- Prosecution Diversion for James Morgan McGill .
 Representing the divertee , Ms. Kimberly Wexler .
 Mr. James McGill has signed a contract waiving his rights to a speedy trial and presentment of his case within the statute of limitations .
 The terms of the deal are for you , James , to report to your Pre- Prosecution Service Officer at the Albuquerque District Attorney 's Office on the second Monday of every month for the next 12 months .



 Community service hours will be assigned .
 You must maintain lawful employment .
 Must only associate with law- abiding citizens .
 Your client understands that , if he violates the terms of the agreement or is arrested for any infraction , the crimes to which he has confessed here will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law , in addition to any new charges ?
 He understands .
 And I must inform you , Mr. McGill , as an officer of the court and member of the bar , your confession will be referred to the New Mexico Bar Association .

 Okay .
 I have your statement here .
 Has everyone had a chance to read it ?
 Comments ?
 Thoughts ? Actually , page 2 , he " damaged the victim 's property . "

 Would it not be more accurate to say
 " destroyed a cassette tape " ?
 I 'm sorry .
 Wasn 't the cassette tape his property ? - Of course it was .
 - Then it seems entirely accurate to say he damaged the victim 's property .
 Why be vague ? And " damaged " doesn 't reflect its irrevocable condition ...
 Fine . " Damaged property belonging to the victim . "
 It was a cassette tape .
 That 's what it was ... not a teacup , not a chair ...
 - a cassette tape .
 - Yeah .
 How about " destroyed item of personal property " ?
 All right .
 Uh , we 'd suggest " destroyed item of personal property . "
 Ms. Wexler ?
 Works for us .
 Shall I change it , or ... ?
 If you would .

 " Destroyed item ...
 " of personal property . "
 There .
 Can you initial it , please ?
 " JMM . " Initialed .
 Charles , was there anything else you found wanting in your brother 's statement ?

 No . We 're satisfied .
 Thank you .
 All right .
 So , we 're all set .
 No , not all set , Mr. McGill .
 Your brother may be satisfied , but I am not .
 The confession you 've written is adequate , but , frankly , I- I sense a lack of remorse .
 And I , for one , would like to hear an apology .
 Charles deserves at least that much .

 Uh ... - Now ?
 - Yes , Mr. McGill , now .
 Okay .
 I was wrong .
 Mr. McGill , could you at least look your brother in the eye ?



 Chuck ...

 I 'm very sorry .
 I lost my temper , and I did some things ... so many things that I regret .
 I shouldn 't have broken down your door .
 Doesn 't matter how I was provoked .
 I- I shouldn 't have done that .
 There 's no excuse for that .
 Or for the things that I said .
 I regret it all , all of it more than you can imagine , because ...
 ' cause you 're my brother , and no one should treat his own brother like that .
 Not ever .
 Okay ?
 All right , then .
 On to the matter of restitution . Mr. McGill , according to your agreement , you have two weeks to pay your brother back .
 I would like to pay up now , if I may .
 You may .
 The amount is $321 .
 Uh , Ms. Hay .
 I 'm sorry .
 That figure doesn 't represent a full accounting .
 Oh , no ?
 I believe the correct amount is $323 . 98 .
 That includes the cassette tape ... which was destroyed .
 Thank you . $323 . 98 , including the cassette tape . Good .











 What do you say we get you home ?
 Howard .
 Chuck .
 I 'm putting you both on notice regarding the bar hearing .
 The first thing , I 'm filing a motion to suppress that tape .
 The tape that Jimmy destroyed , you mean ?
 How about we stop with the games ? There 's no way there isn 't a duplicate .
 Really ?
 Of course there is .
 You knew Jimmy was gonna break in . You wanted him to .
 There 's no way you were gonna let him destroy the only copy of that tape , so you made a duplicate ...
 - it 's the first thing you did .
 - Kim ... this is not how we do discovery .
 Actually , Jimmy destroyed the duplicate .
 Ah , it 's fine , Howard .
 The original is under lock and key , and in due time , it will be put into evidence for your review .
 So , of course , file whatever motions you 'd like .
 - It 's your privilege .
 - I will . Count on it .
 But , Kim , you should be aware ... because I believe this will be your first disciplinary hearing ... uh , the Bar Association 's standard of proof is far more lenient than what you 're used to .

 Motions aside , that tape will be played .


 - Chuck .
 - Yeah .
 See you , Kim .






 Well ?
 What ?
 Bingo .
