 00 : 00 : 00, 231 -- > 00 : 00 : 03, 132 For those of you who are too fucking busy , here 's what happened last week on
 Karen , when do you want me to come back in ? ! Never !
 That girl that you 're with ,

 And from that point on , you won 't be able to hold the job very long because you 'll know the truth , that you never lived up to your potential .
 I 'm gonna give the baby up for adoption .
 How mucho we get for the baby ?
 I introduce you to a pool of parents that want to adopt .
 So you 're a broker ? I 'm gay !
 You 're the one that 's pretending to date Mandy
 Not doing this . Doing what ?
 Figure out that chick who 's sitting on my sofa wearing your wedding ring , and then we 'll talk .
 Just don 't give up on me .
 You doing anything this afternoon ? We need a coach .
 Fiona go to the games ? Never misses one . Call me " Coach . "
 Who 's your friend ?
 Heard you can help me . Need an alibi . How much ? $1, 500 .
 What are you doing ?
 Sending cash to my sons .
 That will make Frank very happy .
 Frank gets none .
 You and Monica are over , Frank .
 Me and Monica are getting married .
 She 's still married to me !
 I have never , ever had any intention of getting back together with you , Frank . Expelled ?
 You win .
 School or leave ! What are you doing ?
 I 'm not going back to school , so I guess it means I 'm leaving . Good- bye , Sheila .
 Good- bye , Peg .
 Frank , your mother 's passed .
 Mom died !

 Lip ?
 Debbie ? ♪ No one likes to be a fool ♪
 ♪ Calling down on the telephone ♪ Lip ?
 Good morning , sweetheart .
 Mom ? ♪ Across the city , across the sea . ♪
 We don 't have any money . Mimosa ?
 Hello ? What ?
 When ? Okay .
 Well , well , how much is that gonna cost ?
 I- I have to call you back with an answer .
 Thank you .
 Grammy died ? Honey , I am so sorry .
 She was my mother . I 'm the one who 's hurting here .
 That was the Cook County Hospital Morgue .
 You need to claim her body or they 're gonna cremate her .
 I am done running around trying to please that woman .
 Grammy died ?
 Debbie !
 Oh , Liam , look at you , my little Brown Bear .
 Look how big you are !
 How long is she staying ? Only forever and a day .
 My camo pants still in the dryer ?
 Ian ! It 's Ian .
 Hell is she doing here ?
 I asked your mother to come home .
 Oh , wait , you live here now , too ?
 I made breakfast . Yeah , no , thanks .
 Your mom spent a lot of time making that breakfast ! Sit down , eat it !
 This is bullshit . Ian , wait .
 I 'm gonna wash his mouth out with soap .
 You can wash mine out . I wanna fart bubbles .
 Carlie ! Mom ?
 You 're so big ! Come on , baby . I made you breakfast .
 Sit do and eat .
 Where 's Lip ?
 My mom showed up today . She just came out of nowhere .
 She staying ?
 Never does .
 Lip playing hooky today ?
 He , uh , dropped out of school . So Fiona gave him the boot .
 I think he 's staying with Karen .
 You know , you kill it in one spot , pops up in another .
 You okay ? Yeah .
 How 's , uh , Mickey holding up in juvie ?
 Called me a fuck- twat , so he seems okay .
 You should visit him .
 Yeah , he 's a little pissed at me for something . Thinks I pussied out .
 Did you ? Kinda .
 You 're lucky your mom 's dd . Yeah .
 So weird to have someone here , and then they 're just ... gone .
 I know . What happens to their soul ?
 Maybe it 's like what happened to Karen in utero .
 She was a twin , and then she just absorbed the other one .
 Whoa . You mean , like , maybe Peggy 's soul got absorbed by us ?
 Maybe .
 Rats !
 It says in order to have a hospice license , I have to get a nursing degree .
 University of River Phoenix . It 's all online .
 Seen the ads on TV .
 Huh .
 Hey !
 Hi !
 Karen ...
 I know it 's your choice , but I just want to go on record as saying I think you should consider keeping the baby .
 And Jody .
 No offense , Lip . None taken .
 Since Frank bailed , can I dump his Speed Stick and English Leather and put my stuff back in the medicine cabinet ?
 Oh , sweetheart , you know , both of you come sit down .
 Sweetie ... ur grandmother 's passing has taken quite a toll on Frank .
 He just needs some time alone .
 Mom , he packed a duffle bag and left .
 Sometimes when people
 love each other very much , they need time apart , so when they come back together , their love is even stronger .
 Okay , Mom . Thanks for the talk , Mrs. Jackson .
 Sure .
 Karen ... is Lip gonna stay overnight again tonight ?
 I told you , he 's just a friend . Needs a place to stay .
 Lip is very nice , but I hope you see what a catch Jody is .
 Jody 's an idiot . Give it time .
 " Then the window draws full upon your mind .
 There , beyond the sway of curtains , men walk . " Maya Angelou said that .
 I 'm pretty sure she wasn 't talking about Jody , but thanks , Mom .
 Okay .
 Are you really gonna do this every morning ?
 Do what ? Show up , try to woo me ?
 I 'm looking for Lip .
 Uh- huh .
 What , I can 't be friends with your brother ? No , you can 't .
 Are we gonna have a funeral ? No .
 Who died ? Grammy .
 Wow .
 I 'm sorry , guys .
 A funeral requires a body , and your father hasn 't picked her up yet .
 So she 's just laying somewhere all alone ?
 Uh , we could have a memorial . I mean , you don 't need a body for that .
 I spy doughnuts !
 Hey , check it out , Steve . It 's a bloody butthole .
 Awesome , dude !
 School . Let 's go .
 Lunch ? Shit !
 We already had that for breakfast .
 You know , sometimes astronauts would have breakfast .
 Lip never came back after he blew out of here .
 Check at Karen 's . Karen 's ? Isn 't she married ?
 Aren 't you ? Technicality .
 Good- bye .
 Oh , such sweet sorrow .
 You gonna drive us ? Absolutely .
 No , he 's not . I mean it , Steve .
 Stop coming around .
 Who was that ?
 Are you still gonna be here when we get home from school ?
 Absolutely . I told you so .
 Shut up ! You didn 't believe her either .
 You know what I think ? I think we should paint your room a new color today .
 Here . Go now !
 Have fun at school !
 Hey ... I got this .
 So , where is Lip ? Really ?
 That 's what you want to ask me ? Should 've known .
 He 's always been your favorite .
 That is not true , Fiona .
 Oh , that 's right . You 're your favorite .
 So , uh ... Bob throw you out , or you walk out on her , too ?
 Your father came to me . He needed me .
 Told me you needed me , too .
 He lied . We don 't .
 I 'm sorry . I 'm here now . I want to try and start over .
 Will you let me ?
 Lip dropped out of school .
 I told him , back in school or he couldn 't live here .
 You threw him out ? He left .
 He 's family , Fiona .
 Lip chose to leave this family . That sound familiar ?
 Look at my two girls , together in the kitchen .
 I don 't know which one of you is prettier .
 I don 't have time for this . I got to get Liam dressed .
 Where you taking him ? He comes to work with me .
 No , that 's silly . Leave him home .
 His mother .
 Come on , let me prove to you that I can take care of him , please .
 You 're gonna be me all day ? Absolutely .
 You 're not going to ave with him ? Run off and join the circus or some crazy shit like that ?
 I just want to take care of my baby , Fiona .
 Thank you .
 Ooh , we 're going to have so much fun , my little Brown Bear .
 Uh , milk and water from the sippy cup .

 Got it .
 And he 's got to drink it from a big boy cup .
 I 'm going to drink a beer from a big boy cup .
 Want to watch ?
 Yeah .
 You know , I saw Choady sneaking out when we came in .
 My mom lets him in when I 'm not home .
 It 's like having a wet Labrador .
 Fucking clueless .
 So ... how long are you planning on staying ?
 What , you mean here ?
 Mom wants to know . Says I have to charge you rent .
 Your mom wants me to pay rent ?
 Well , how much ? $100 a week .
 What aunt dead daddy 's insurance money ?
 My check 's tied up at the claims department .
 I could stay in the basement .
 Could knock $20 off , but ... still going have to charge you .
 Fuck you , Karen .
 Isn 't that how we got into this mess ?
 You know what ? And fuck me going on any more of the adoption interviews .
 You know , good luck signing off on an adoption without the biological father 's signature .
 I 'll get Frank to go with me .
 Might not even have to cut him in .
 ♪ Till you walked out the door ♪ ♪ And I 've seen that face before ♪ ♪ Now I 'll always wonder why ... ♪
 I 'm always pleasantly surprised we don 't find dead hookers cut up in the toilets .
 There 's still time .
 Where 's Liam ?
 Monica dumped Bob and showed up on our doorstep to play house .
 She insisted on watching Liam today .
 He 's probably got his tongue in an outlet by now .
 Oh , shit . I 'm sorry .
 First thing she did was bu my balls for kicking Lip out .
 You didn 't kick him out .
 Feel like I might have , giving him an ultimatum .
 I miss him .
 Especially with Monica home .
 Lip usually has my back in that fight .
 See , this is the kind of shit I 'm afraid of happening if Kev and I have a kid or two .
 Little fuckers gang up on you .
 I 've seen this movie before .
 Monica comes home long enough to reunite with Frank , gets knocked up with another kid , then splits .
 Not this time .
 Not gonna let her ruin Debbie and Carl 's lives , too .
 Trash can 's a foot away , people . Why you got to be such nasty pigs ?
 Human nature .
 Given the choice , people usually do the wrong thing .
 Can 't take it anymore .
 I 'm going to run home , check on Liam before we hit the ground floor .
 Not a lot of trust in Monica .
 Might be nice to have some time for an actual life while she 's around .
 Ain 't you just the queen of silver linings ?
 Live a little while you can .
 Ugh .
 What ? Hey , where 'd you disappear to ?
 I didn 't know I had to report to you , but if you must know , school .
 Right .
 Look . I 'm sorry about that shit that happened earlier .
 Give me the rest of the day to find a new place to stay ?
 Fine .
 And , um ...
 I want to go on the rest of the adoption meetings with you , all right ?
 You know , I- I 'd kind of like to have a say in where this kid might end up .
 Well , go if you fucking want to go , but I don 't need help or handouts from anyone .
 Hey , Ron . I need to talk to you .
 What the hell are you doing here ?
 My wife 's inside .
 Thing is , I 'm kind of pregnant , and it 's yours . I want to get an abortion , but I can 't afford it , and I can 't apply for a credit card 'cause I 'm not 18 . What ?


 Hang on .
 We had fun , though , didn 't we ?
 Sometimes , when I see the word " hospice " on the screen , I pronounce it
 " ho spice " in my head . Isn 't that silly ?
 Sometimes I do that with " butt ... ermilk . "
 But ... " ermilk 's " not really a word .
 Did you just hear what you just said ?
 You said , " Buttermilk 's not really a word . "
 Oh .
 I did .
 Did you hear that ?
 Been hearing a lot of weird noises the last few days .
 So have I.
 Don 't think I 'm crazy , but sometimes I think
 Eddie 's spirit is still in this house .
 Eddie ?
 Eddie ?
 Mom had a huge chunk of cash lying around before she kicked it . Aah !
 How much ? 75 large .
 Oh , God ! I think it 's at Sheila 's .
 Get it . Hmm ? Get it , and give it to me .
 Yeah ? Okay . Yeah .
 Give it to me .
 Oh !
 Jesus Christ ! Really ? In the kitchen ?
 I thought you were working , honey .
 - Where 's Liam ? - He 's sleeping !
 And I will remind you this is our house and we can make love in any room we want to .
 Your kids eat off that table !
 Let 's fuck in her room next .
 Give it to me !
 Give it to me !

 I know that shit , bitch . That 's a cat !
 You ordering shit off the TV again ?
 Just a little bit of this , honey . Just a little bit of this !
 Hey , I 'll see you after work . All right .
 Bitch Karen 's trying to make me pay rent .
 Can you believe that shit ?
 Hey , you want to play a quick game before my shift ?
 What , you got it ? Hell , yeah , I got it .
 I waited in line .
 Hey , um ... cool if I stay at your place a couple days ?
 Shit , yeah .
 Kevin . Kitchen .
 Lip is not staying with us .
 We are not getting in the middle of this Gallagher shit storm .
 You guys are taking Fiona 's side on this ?
 Fiona will have our asses for harboring her fugitive .
 What if we adopt Lip as our own ?
 Wouldn 't that change everything ?
 Damn . Calm down .
 Go home Lip .
 I 'm sorry , dude . You can 't stay here .
 Well , what the fuck , man ?
 Yeah , well , thanks for all your help , Kev .
 Your taxes done or your liquor commission test taken or you get your tongue stuck to a frozen pole , all right ?
 I like to wash her late in the day .
 In the sun , the water can dry too fast and leave spots .
 Good to know .
 She send you ? No .
 She doesn 't know I 'm here .
 She needs you , Bob .
 You 're the best thing that ever happened to her .
 I don 't want shit to do with that bitch anymore .
 Especially now that her snatch is on that nasty old Irish cock of Frank 's .
 Pass .
 You don 't love her ?
 Love ain 't got nothing to do with it .
 Living with Monica was like living with a black hole .
 Drained my spirit and my bank account .
 Bitch spent all my money on meditation retreats and unfinished , half- assed home renovations !
 Thank the good Lord Frank showed up when he did .
 Frank came looking for her ?
 Crying like a little bitch about his dead mama .
 Shit , they 're pathetic -- both of them !
 Monica 's your problem now .
 Presenting His and Her Lordship , Frank and Monica Gallagher !
 Holy shit .
 About time . You still got an open tab running , bitch . Kate !
 How are you , baby ?
 Better without your bad influence .
 Oh , please , give me a break .
 Hey , Monica . Hi , Gus !
 Wow .
 New tattoo ? Yeah , yeah . Good one , huh ?
 Oh , Kev ! You remembered .
 Irish Car Bomb . How could I forget ?
 I 'll have one of those , too , K- Ball . You can 't handle an Irishar Bomb .
 You look good , Moni . You back on your meds ?
 Ah , hell , no . That crap makes me all foggy and gets me fat .
 Besides , I am not bipolar .
 Give me a dollar .

 All right . It 's all yours , pal .
 Shh .
 Mom hid the money in here somewhere .
 Be vewy quiet .
 I 'm hunting wabbits .
 Just the house ... settling .
 Wind .
 It 's ... the wind settling the house .
 Shh !
 Shh !
 Karen ? Smells like Bengay in here .
 Karen ?
 Look inside the cushions .
 Mom was always a big cushion hider .
 Okay .
 Nope .
 Go . What ?
 No ! No , no , no ! Wait , wait , wait .
 Eddie ? Is that you ?
 I don 't know exactly what it is ... that you want ...
 But I 'm ... I 'm here to talk .
 Can you talk , Eddie ?
 Well , that 's a silly question , isn 't ?
 ' Cause , if you couldn 't , you wouldn 't be able to tell me .
 Huh ? !
 Hey , Professor , you got a minute ?
 Got a classroom full of freshmen staring at a Smart Board .
 Just wondering if you , uh , had any work for me .
 Work after school ?
 Uh , no , I , uh ... I- I dropped out . I got a baby on the way .
 Was wondering if you could hook me up as a TA or something .
 You can 't do shit without a diploma .
 Well , tell them I 'm an idiot savant or something .
 I 'll tell them you 're an idiot .
 When don 't you call me when you graduate with a 4 . 5 GPA ?
 Wow , so , uh , under the liberal beard lives an uptight bourgeois prick .
 You think I like being a soothsayer and watching you live out your fate ?
 Congratulations -- you 're a high school dropout with a pregnant girlfriend .
 And the only thing that 's missing for you is a job at Mickey D 's .
 And if you work really hard , you might get your picture with the dead eyes in the employee of the month frame over the cash register .
 Huh ? That would be fun , wouldn 't it ?
 Go back to school .
 Good boy . Yum .
 What 's this ?
 There 's no more room in this world for another Gallagher .
 Birth control -- you either hop on the Ortho bandwagon or leave .
 It 's okay to take it with your shrink meds . I checked .
 That the same speech you gave Lip ?
 Same speech , different outcome .
 Thanks . No biggie .
 If they haven 't shut down our Planned Parenthood yet , we can make you an appointment to get your own RX .
 No . Thanks for everything .
 For taking care of my kids , my house , my husband .
 We all did it .
 No . You did it , Fi .
 And I know what a huge sacrifice it must have been .
 And I can probably never make it up to you , but I want to try .
 Thanks .
 So the whole ...
 Bob thing was just a phase or what ?
 You sure you 're not going to need these ?
 Mmm . Not lately , but who knows ?
 What about the guy who came by yesterday ?
 Steve .
 I remember him . He 's cute .
 I would totally hit that .
 Ew .
 Mom ! No , I 'm not gonna .
 Better not . I 'm already up against a hot Brazilian .
 He 's got a girlfriend ? Wife .
 Fiona !
 Oh , you 're going to judge me ?
 So ... how we gonna get rid of her ?
 Yeah .
 She 's gone ! She 's gone !
 Oh , this is nice . Estefania 's dad .
 Huh .
 Now , you realize you guys basically have the same name , right ?
 Look , I can get you back in my sister 's lap if you let me stay here for a bit .
 How long you need to stay ?
 Just till I 'm back on my feet .
 Well , always saw myself living with a Gallagher .
 Just always thought it would be Fiona .
 Listen , you put me up for a bit , it 'll piss her off so much she 'll be back at your doorstep in a heartbeat .
 Listen -- maybe , in exchange for staying here , you can help me out .
 Putting together a pretty big deal .
 I- I don 't know .
 Last time I helped you out with a deal , I ended handcuffed to a bench .
 You know how to hack a voice mail ?
 Probably . For the right price .
 Hi .
 Oh . Right . Remember me ?
 Uh , Lip .
 Oh , that 's ...
 There 's a robe in the bathroom .
 You can use the robe .
 Jesus .
 Oh , bye- bye . Okay .
 Shit , man , I got to be somewhere . You got a key ?
 Uh , I 'll leave one for you at the front desk .
 Here . I 'll , uh , do my best , Mr. Murdoch .
 Hearing from you was a wonderful surprise .
 Oh . I thought we 'd lost you for good .
 Well , my recently- deceased husband was born again . Mm- hmm .
 So we went to that church with all the guitars and the minister with the Hawaiian shirt .
 Well , I 'm just so glad that you accepted my invitation .
 Actually , there was a favor I wanted to ask . Mm- hmm .
 Someone else home ?
 No .
 Do you believe in evil spirits , Father ?
 I believe people can become harassed by evil spirits as a result of evil actions .
 Hmm . Until they repent , those spirits linger .
 Well , any idea how one might cast them out of one 's house before one opens a hospice business ?
 Well , in Matthew 5 : 22 , Jesus says that we need to repent ... Mm- hmm . Forgive and love .
 Is there someone you need to forgive ?
 Anything you need to repent ?
 Relax .

 Go into the light !
 Nothing comes to mind . But I 'll pray on it .
 Jody ! My man !
 Hey , Frank .
 You just missed lunch .
 Just getting something from the Kash and Grab .
 Headed there myself .
 Really sorry about your mom , man . Must be tough .
 It is . There 's so much I still want to say to her .
 So many questions .
 She loved you , Frank . Just didn 't know how to say it .
 Yes . I know that now .
 Also know she was sitting on a pretty big pile of money .
 Wanted me to act as an executor of her will .
 Any idea where she kept the cash ?
 In the cushions . I knew it .
 But then she divided it up .
 Gave Sheila a grand to say thanks and had me mail the rest .
 What ? Mail it ?
 Where ? To who ? Whom .
 What ? To whom .
 To whom the fuck did she mail the fucking money ? !
 They were all Gallagher names .
 It was , uh , Wyatt , Clayton , I think . My fucking brothers ? !
 Where were they at the bitter end ? ! Holding her hand ? !
 No , that was -- That bitch !
 Shit !
 Talk to you later .
 Fuck ! Goddamn it !
 Oh , shit . Carl , I might 've shrunk your jersey .
 Oh , hi . I thought you were Carl .
 Mom ? This is Little Hank .
 That 's your mom ? Hey , handsome .
 Made some cookies .
 Did you pick up Grammy 's body yet ?
 No , not yet , honey . It 's expensive .
 I have some money . No .
 Look at you .
 Like living with a slutty Doris Day .
 Did you have any luck finding it ?
 Nope . No ? Not even in her box of horrors .
 Mom sent it to my brothers
 Deb , I made you a matching cheer outfit ! It 's up on your bed .
 Grammy 's body ? Not too cute in a cheer outfit .
 Where is she ? They 've got her on ice , honey .
 There 's no rush .
 Heard a girl 's mom 's the best way to tell how a girl 's gonna look .
 You 're gonna be a fucking fox , man .
 Hey , sweetie . I made some cookies .
 Oh , so now we 're , like , square for you abandoning us and everything .
 Hey . Are you coming with us to Carl 's game ?
 Yeah , I 'm going to Carl 's game .
 I always go to Carl 's games , ' cause I actually give a shit .
 Ian Clayton Gallagher , I told you , do not talk to your mother like that .
 You haven 't even claimed your mom 's body from the morgue and you want to tell me how to treat mine ?
 He 's got a point .
 Your dad told me about the kid in the store .
 You must be sad having someone you care about in jail .
 But you should never feel ashamed about what and who you are .
 I 'm not .
 Well , when I was with Roberta , I was proud .
 No , it wasn 't a perfect relationship , but we were never ashamed .
 Maybe you should have been .
 So how about , after Carl 's game , I take you out ?
 Cheer you up .
 Maybe .
 Less ogling , more hacking .
 Jesus , I 'm in the voice mailbox .
 I just need to figure out how to copy the messages without people being able to tell they were ever listened to .
 You want to tell me what this is all about ?
 Less you know , the better .
 Now I 'm off to lead a pack of tiny , testosteroned animals to victory .
 Gonna warm 'em up and give 'em my best speech about hearts and eyes or some shit .
 I don 't know . Where go ? Uh , the game .
 Football . I go .
 Uh , Lip , you mind bringing Este later ? What do you think ?
 Uh , Lip will bring you later . You go Lip .
 Ah , yes ! I come on Lip .

 Hut ! Go , go , go !

 Lip !
 Lip ! Come on , honey , sit down .
 Come on , sit with us !
 What , I 'm off the boat for one minute and there 's a fucking mutiny ?
 Yeah , well no one told you to get out of the boat .
 Actually , you did . Hey , Lip , don 't be mad at Fiona .
 Come on . Hey , Monica , shut up .
 You know what , like most of my life , this has nothing to do with you .
 I sit ? What ? Yeah , sit .
 Wherever 's fine . Oh , you babysitting now ?
 Roommate .
 You 're living at Steve 's ?
 Yeah , no curfews , no ultimatums , no befriending the enemy behind my back .
 Come on . She just showed up .
 What was I supposed to do ?
 Oh , really ? Oh , you 're just gonna storm off like a baby ? !
 Too bad there 's no door you can slam !
 Your son 's a real prick .
 Hut !
 That 's what I 'm talking about ! Yeah !
 Yes ! All right , nice effort out there , D 'Shawn .
 Just try throwing the ball to someone on your own team next time .
 Lip 's living with you ?
 He was sleeping on the El . Kid had nowhere else to go .
 They 're ten . Have them run the ball , for Christ 's sake .
 You 're going out .
 You 're going out . Go , go , go , go , go , go !
 So , my friend Flying Crow ...
 Yeah ? ... said smudging is a surefire way to get rid of evil spirits in a house .
 Be gone , spirits .
 In the name of our Savior Jesus Christ , we ask that you leave .
 And you don 't want to piss him off , so just go , okay ?
 I really am so sorry about all of this with Karen .
 Her throwing you out . I- I feel so responsible for her behavior .
 Don 't .
 It 's not your fault she 's going through a hard time .
 Yes , but even so , you deserve better .
 You 're a good man , Jody .
 We should pray on it .
 Yeah .
 Why don 't you get your own fries ?
 ' Cause I want to eat yours .
 So , I was minding my own business , listening in on Estefania 's phone call .
 Turns out she 's totally in love with some other guy .
 You know , she 's playing Steve .
 So ? So you think I should tell him about it ?
 What 's in it for you if you do ?
 It 's not about me .
 Exactly . If there 's no money involved , don 't get other people 's sh on your shoes .
 So you 're saying if I was rich , then you 'd consider keeping the kid with me ?
 How rich ?
 Because if you were that rich , there 's no way you 'd think you still wanted this kid .
 You might think you do now , but in the long run ?
 Hi . Hi .
 I 'm Alana . This is Jeff .
 Sorry I got started without you guys .
 Have to keep the little guy fed .
 So , you 're 17 ?
 Oh , yeah , we both are .
 So , what do you drive ? Your cars ?
 Um , I drive a Lexus and Alana 's got a Volvo .
 Two cars . You guys are flush .
 Uh , is Lip here ?
 Oh , no . Lip no home .
 Nice surprise .
 Throw him out . What ?
 He needs to be in school .
 I 'm not his father , and more importantly , you 're not his mother .
 Yeah . If I was , I would 've beaten him black and blue with a wooden spoon .
 You don 't always have to be responsible for everyone , Fiona .
 Excuse me ?
 Monica 's back .
 Enjoy it . Take the GED . Read a book .
 Fuck you .
 Truth ?
 I took in the bear cub looking to rile the adult female .
 Hoping she 'd charge over here .
 Dangerous . She might rip your head off .
 Hasn 't yet .
 Truth ? I 'm here to see Estefania .
 Really ?
 Hey , Este , Fiona wants to take you out tonight .
 Huh ?
 Uh , drinking . Dancing . Fiona .
 Ah !
 You 're such an asshole .
 Enemies closer , right ?
 He can 't stay here .
 Promise me you 'll kick him out .
 Ah , Lip .
 What the hell was that about ? You .
 Me and Bob used to come here .
 It 's a great mix of gay , lesbian , bi and some cool breeders .
 It 's , uh , a little weird being ut " with you .
 No shame , baby . See ?
 But don 't even think about coming out at school .
 Somebody in that neighborhood will knife you , for sure .
 Think I 'll get carded ?
 Nah . You 're the bread and butter here .
 They need fresh meat to keep the old guys coming in .
 Ooh . 3 : 00 . That guy is totally checking you out .
 You 're kidding , right ?

 Does Fiona talk about me ?
 What , you 're gonna break your happy home with Estefania ?
 I 'm not in love with her , but I shit myself every time
 I think about what her dad would do if I dumped her .
 That 's goo 'cause she doesn 't love you either .

 Are you fucking kidding me ?
 No , I heard them on the phone . Pretty hot and heavy .
 Sneaky bitch .
 She 's such a fucking bitch .
 I mean , how do you put up with her ?
 You ... Estefania ?
 No , fucking Fiona . You know what ? she was right to kick you out of the house .
 You should be in school .
 Yeah , well , maybe I 'll enroll again in May .
 Just in time to take your wife to prom .
 Okay . Uh , I 'm gonna change . Uh , my- my clothes .
 Okay .

 Okay .
 Why don 't you just donate her to science ?
 Don 't want her !
 Listen , please , don 't throw her away .
 I- I ... how much would it cost to bury her ?
 That much ? I 'm just so wasted right now .
 Could we talk about this tomorrow ?
 Please ? Thank you .
 My mother , even dead , she 's a pain in the ass .
 Hey ! Hi , you guys !
 Wha ...
 Hey , hey . Who is this ? Uh , that is Steve 's wife .
 Oh , the Brazilian ! We brought doughnuts and a bucket of chicken . Hi !

 This is not okay .
 Oh , come on .

 Vodka , lemonade , blender .
 Everybody , shut up .
 Hey !
 Debbie would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about Grammy Gallagher .
 Well , I guess what I 'm gonna say is that Grammy will be missed .
 And if she 's watching right now , I want her to know that we love her .
 To Grammy . Grammy !

 Don 't be mad .
