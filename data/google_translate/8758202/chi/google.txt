‎ I 'm so mad at her
‎ She didn 't tell me I thought I knew
‎ I don 't know
‎ The last time I spoke to her she was so happy‎ and like that she died
‎ I don 't know why she did this
‎ I asked myself countless times why she was like this
‎ Is it because of a guy or her class‎ or the state of the world?
‎ Or because of me? because of something I did?
‎ I racked my brains but no answer nothing
‎ She 's dead and can 't tell things so. . . ‎ This will never stop. . . ‎ The need to know
‎ never stop

‎ Say the thing that broke me

‎ This is the first time I say
‎ It 's hard to please everyone
‎ - You did a great job‎ - Really?
‎ yes
‎ Scared to go there for the first time?
‎ Frankly I don 't know
‎ you . . .
‎ While I was here‎ You haven 't spoken yet I mean because . . .
‎ I just haven 't found the right moment

‎ Armed Response Team on Standby
‎ That 's her son
‎Chris Christopher‎ He moved in after she died
‎ It 's been a few months anyway
‎ - Is he alone? ‎ - not sociable towards him
‎ Drive to work every morning‎ He probably works somewhere in London
‎ What happened to him?
‎ The suspect has been identified‎ as Christopher Gihani
‎ good
‎ He seems to live in the house of his deceased mother
‎ Lots of overdue bills‎ House to be repossessed
‎ What information was found about the suspect?
‎ - Formerly a teacher‎ - So he is a teacher?
‎ He used to be a teacher
‎ Teach IT
‎ He has been registered as unemployed for two years
‎ - How is his record? ‎ - we checked
‎ He has no criminal record
‎ The only record is that he was a victim ‎ There was a traffic accident on November 2015
‎ Drunk driver hits him directly
‎ Two deaths including drunk driver
‎ - Good job Najma‎ - Sir
‎ A teacher with a real gun?
‎ not impossible but unlikely‎ sir
‎ is the FBI
‎ What?
‎ is an FBI emergency number
‎ I 'm Chief Superintendent Grace
‎ Hello Chief Superintendent
‎ I 'm Ernisto Cruz from the FBI
‎ Excuse me, what 's going on?
‎ We are working with Fragmented companies in Silicon Valley
‎ They are also answering the call
‎ Are they online too?
‎ yes hello i am shard wu penelope
‎ Don from Legal and Sanelle from Analytics‎ with me
‎ I 'm David Gilkes‎ ‎ Negotiation Expert
‎ Listen to Ms. Wu as we identify the suspect
‎ Christopher McGeehany‎ Former school teacher
‎ 3 3 years old he has a fragmented profile
‎ yes
‎ Okay first Christopher is on hold‎ but we can hear what 's going on over there‎ so we 'll share the live feed with you guys
‎ - Is it? Very helpful‎ - other than that
‎ We thought we could share data about him‎ to assist the police‎ negotiation but first‎ you might share with us‎ what you think he is doing
‎ Likely to be blackmail regardless of the target
‎ - Is it your company . . . ‎ - We are the target
‎ - What did you say? ‎ - We are looking for information on Christopher
‎ We do a group query‎ to classify him as high IQ, low income
‎ These people are usually angry
‎ Check with us‎ as an entity‎ if he ever expressed hostility to the shards‎ but nothing on his socials
‎ In fact for a long time‎ no activity at all
‎ Entire account is dormant
‎ I don 't see how this has anything to do with this case
‎ But then we got in touch with the guys from the ride-hailing company‎
‎ - ok‎ - the taxi that picks up Jayden‎ registered under Omama Simbaru

‎ I think you 'll all agree with a name like this‎ It doesn 't match Mr. Gehani
‎ yes
‎ It turned out to be a compromised account
‎ It is possible that people trading Chris on the dark web may have obtained the account this way
‎ Can you understand what I 'm saying?
‎ He has been covering his tracks

‎ We asked Hitchhiker to share his account activity‎ For weeks he seemed to only accept
‎ Jobs outside The Shard 's London branch
‎ He parked the car every day and waited, until someone in the building called the car. . . .

‎ This is his whole plan
‎ I mean it 's a well-planned crime
‎ I have a hard time believing he never got noticed before
‎ He has no criminal record
‎ I mean he was the victim . . .
‎ 2015 Car Accidents
‎His fiancee died in that crash‎ Did you know about it?
‎ (DUI victim dies two months later)
‎ don 't know
‎ but you know
‎ There are previous posts in his network‎ ​​condolences, condolences in fact‎ Chris no longer uses this account since then‎ Does not interact with friends
‎ Even those friends who express condolences
‎ - You investigated very carefully‎ - Well I don 't think this case has anything to do with money
‎ - David‎ - go on
‎ Chris is about the same age as Ball
‎ Right? Both have geek backgrounds‎ - Computers. . . ‎ - David. . .
‎ Maybe Chris also thinks it has something to do with money
‎ But the point is status
‎ Ball was rich and powerful‎ and respected
‎ What does Christopher have?
‎ He has no money to open a rental and loses his fiancée
‎ and his mother
‎ What if Christopher thinks he wants everything Ball has?
‎ But the point is really to get Ball 's attention
‎ What if this was the case?
‎ Will this help you convince him to get out of the car?
‎ It would help if he would listen to me

‎ Christopher!

‎ hello christopher
‎ Christopher My name is David Gilkes
‎ I 'm David okay?
‎ Can you see me waving in the park?
‎ The guy in the cheap suit
‎ Listen to a lot of cops here frankly ‎ They are just doing their due diligence ‎ But I think they 're worried that you 're going to hurt yourself

‎ Are you a negotiator?
‎ My name is David
‎ Thanks David Are you a negotiator?
‎ That 's what some people call me‎ But I 'm really just . . .
‎ I 've read about Negotiators
‎ You pretend to be my friend‎ Then you slowly try to convince me to surrender
‎ Chris you 're obviously smart I don 't want to bullshit . . .
‎ If wisdom doesn 't work‎ ​​You 'll let me keep talking on the phone
‎ Speak long enough‎ so that one of the snipers can aim for the head
‎ Right David?
‎ - We try to . . . ‎ - Don 't!
‎ we . . . ‎ you fuck me
‎ Hang up I 'm waiting for Billy Ball
‎ Okay, you 're the guy in the cheap suit, right? ‎ That 's what you said?
‎ - Yes‎ - That 's how good things go
‎ I will count to one hundred
‎ - Chris . . . ‎ - ok I 'll count to fifty
‎ If I don 't see you in the car, get out
‎ I 'll shoot him in the head!
‎ - Chris doesn 't have to be like this‎ - 1, 2
‎ - Harris, are you aiming? ‎ - three

‎ - Don 't move‎ - I 'm sorry I got a cramp
‎ damn
‎ I got a call from the UK police‎ He refused to speak to the negotiator

‎ Agent Cruz‎ Can we chat alone for a while?

‎ good

‎ - We gotta tell Billy what happened‎ - Billy isn 't here, okay?
‎ I can 't just call him like this
‎ Where is he?
‎He 's on a ten-day silent vacation‎ Six days have passed
‎ - Silent Vacation‎ - Only Himself
‎ Complete isolation by not talking to anyone
‎ He 's had a tech detox weekend in various places‎ But ten days?
‎ I 'm very reluctant to interfere with this
‎ But you know where he is, right?
‎ He doesn 't know but of course I know
‎ ( Furnace Creek Valley, Utah)
‎ Mr. Ball?
‎ Anyone?
‎ Anyone?
‎ Mr. Ball?

‎ I 'm very . . . ‎ sorry to bother you‎ but you need to know if something goes wrong
‎ A man in the UK has taken one of our intern hostages and threatened to kill him
‎ unless I can talk to you
‎ So good!

‎ He almost ran into us and then... . ‎ He crashed into that field over there
‎ That 's when he showed his gun

‎ (emergency calls only) ‎ (shard app) ‎ (please enter Chris Gihani 's passcode)
‎ - He just logged in now ‎ - What is he doing?
‎ He seems to be reading the posts of bystanders at the scene
‎ How old are you?
‎ 2 2 years old

‎ Do you have a girlfriend?
‎ or boyfriend partner whatever
‎ Currently none



‎ you know . . . ‎ they might be lenient if you surrender
‎ Can 't do it


‎ This is my last day
‎ This is my last day
‎ This is my last day
‎ - I want to talk to that person‎ - It is not wise to do so
‎ Legally and personally‎ I strongly advise you not to do this
‎ What would you do if he asked you for a million dollars?
‎ I 'll tell him it 's okay
‎ - We can 't give money . . . ‎ - I don 't mean to give him money
‎ I mean buy us more time
‎ As soon as any transfer is mentioned . . .
‎ God fuck the money!
‎ damn
‎ With all due respect, Mr. Ball, as far as we know, this man intends to kill the hostage as soon as he speaks to you.
‎ I don 't think so

‎ I think for this we can 't trust feelings

‎ Maybe that 's part of the problem
‎ I want to talk to him
‎ They also have a news cart

‎ My mom would freak out
‎ She 's always worried about me. . .
‎ Your mother has nothing to worry about
