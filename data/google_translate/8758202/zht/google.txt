‎ suddenly
‎ One of her roommates called me
‎ Said to have found her body in the bathroom
‎ I 'm so pissed
‎ I 'm so crazy about her
‎ Didn 't tell me, I thought I knew
‎ I don 't know
‎ I talked to her for the last time‎ She was still very happy, but she ended it like this
‎ I don 't know why she killed herself
‎ I asked myself eight million times
‎ Because boys and schoolwork are dissatisfied with the status quo of the world
‎ Or because of me? Am I doing something wrong?
‎ I keep thinking about these things in my head‎ But there is no answer, nothing
‎ But there is no she can ask‎ So this need to know feeling . . . ‎ will never end
‎ The day does not end

‎ I dated a man I met from a dating app 4 months ago
‎ Halfway through the appetizer‎ I told him about Christine

‎ I 'm Division Chief Grace
‎ Hi Division Chief
‎ I 'm Ernisto Cruz from the FBI
‎ Yes, what 's the matter?
‎ We 're in touch with Silicon Valley 's private Trane
‎ They are also on the phone
‎ Are they online too?
‎ Yes, Hi I 'm Penelope Wu of Private Trane
‎ and Dunn from Legal‎ and Chanel from Analytics
‎ I 'm David Geeks, Negotiation Expert
‎ Ms. Wu, we have identified the suspect
‎ Christopher Gilhaine‎ Former school teacher
‎ 33 years old, private Trane user
‎ yes
‎ Let 's start with Christopher 's waiting on the phone, but we can hear what 's going on on his side, so we 'll share the real-time update with you.
‎ - Is it? That 's useful‎ - other than that . . .
‎ I would like to share the data we have obtained from him‎ to help with the negotiation on your side‎ But first . . . ‎ Maybe you can share‎ What is your judgment on his intentions?
‎ 80% of extortion, regardless of target . . .
‎ - Is it your company . . . ‎ ‎ exactly
‎ - What did you transcribe? ‎ ‎ We are investigating Christopher 's background
‎ He belongs to the high-IQ, low-income group
‎ usually an angry person
‎ Yes, we checked‎ to see if he has expressed hostility to the private Trane company‎ but there is no sign of it on his social network
‎ In fact, he hasn 't used social networks for a long time
‎ Entire account is silent
‎ I don 't see the connection
‎ But then we asked the downwind rider
‎ - Yes‎ - Car loaded into Jayden‎ The registered owner is Omama Simbalu

‎ I think you 'd agree with a name like that‎ I don 't quite get along with Mr. Gilhaney
‎ That 's right
‎ It turned out to be a compromised account
‎ Someone would buy and sell these kinds of accounts on the dark web‎ Chris probably got it
‎ Do you understand what I 'm saying?
‎ He is annihilating evidence

‎ So let 's ride a ride‎ Share his account activity‎ Seems like it 's been weeks‎ where he accepts rides
‎ Exclusively for private outside Trane London offices
‎ Just stop there every day‎ and wait until someone in the building calls a car
‎ This is something he had planned for a long time.
‎ This is a sophisticated crime
‎ I 'm surprised he never got the attention of the police
‎ He has no criminal record at all
‎ He was the victim . . .
‎ 2015 Car Accidents
‎ That car accident took his fiancée 's life‎ Did you know?
‎ (DUI victim dies two months later)
‎ don 't know
‎ But you know
‎ There are historical posts on his social network‎, tributes, memorials‎ Actually, Chris closed himself at this time‎ and did not communicate with friends.
‎ Even those who offer condolences
‎ - You guys did your homework ‎ - Well, I don 't think it 's about the money
‎ ‎ David . . . ‎ ‎ continued
‎ Chris is about the same age as Ball
‎ Right? Also all tech background‎ - Computer. . . ‎ - David. . .
‎ Maybe even Chris thinks it 's for the money
‎ But it 's for status
‎ Ball was rich and powerful‎ Respected
‎ What does Christopher have?
‎ He is poor, he drives a bad car, and he just lost his fiancée
‎ and his mother
‎What if Christopher thinks he 's going to have everything Ball has?
‎ But just to get Ball 's attention
‎ What if that was the case?
‎ Does this help you convince him to get out of the car?
‎ If he will listen to me, yes

‎ Christopher

‎ Hi Christopher
‎ Christopher, I 'm David Geeks
‎ I 'm David, okay?
‎ You can see me in the cop car ‎ That 's the guy waving the arm
‎ The one in the cheap suit
‎Listen, there are a lot of cops out there, and to be honest, they 're just doing their jobs, but I think they 're worried that you 're going to hurt yourself . . .

‎ Are you a negotiator?
‎ I am David
‎ Thanks, David, are you a negotiator?
‎Some people call me that‎ but I 'm just . . .
‎ I 've read the presentations of the negotiators
‎ You pretend to be my friend‎ and slowly try to convince me to surrender
‎ Chris, you 're obviously a smart guy‎ so I won 't talk about it . . .
‎ If gentle persuasion doesn 't work‎ ​​you 'll use the phone to distract me
‎ until your snipers‎ have a good chance of blowing my head
‎ Right, David?
‎ - Let 's try . . . ‎ - Don 't . . .
‎ we . . . you go away
‎ Hang up, I 'm waiting for Billy Ball
‎ Well, the one in the cheap suit is you‎ did you say that?
‎ ‎ Yes‎ - ok, so just do it
‎ I will count to one hundred

‎ This is my last day
‎ - I 'm going to talk to that person‎ - that 's not a good idea
‎ For law or for personal use, I strongly oppose you doing that
‎ What if he asks for a million dollars?
‎ I would say give it to him
‎ - We can 't give money to . . . ‎ - I don 't really want to give him money
‎ I mean it buys us more time
‎ Just the mention of paying ransoms . . .

‎ Let 's go see my mom
‎ My mother is sick, we will go to see her‎ I drive Tan Shan back to our apartment
‎ she fell asleep
‎ She was tired, I took her home
‎ Boring on the road
‎ Driving is boring
‎ I get bored every ten seconds‎ and then . . . ‎ I hit a main road
‎ very quiet street
‎ My phone lights up, I pick it up and see
‎ Just take a look
‎ It 's just a small notification saying‎ I leave a message to someone 's photo, and the other person likes it
‎ I just glanced at it
‎ It 's over at once


‎ She took two months to die
‎ I 've been watching her from the hospital bed
‎ not useful
‎ The person in the other car also died

‎ He DUI
‎ Everyone blames him, saying he did it
‎ Everyone takes pity on me, Mr. Tragedy
‎ including her parents
‎ At her funeral, her mother was still comforting me
‎ Damn
‎ What can I tell her?
‎ No one wants to hear their daughter die. . . ‎ because I 'm fucking looking down at my phone
‎ Then everyone . . . ‎ wanted me to go to grief counseling
‎ say it
‎ say how you feel
‎ ( Psychological team is present to develop dialogue strategies)
‎ And what I thought was
‎ I can 't express how I feel
‎ (recommended as follows: )
‎ Because I feel like I killed her
‎ I killed her
‎ it 's me

‎ I killed her for looking at a picture of a dog . . . ‎
‎ I killed her . . .
‎ (One, let him know you 're listening)
‎ I heard
‎ What?
‎ I said . . .
‎ I heard
‎ Of course you heard it
‎ (two, express empathy)
‎ - You sound painful‎ - What the fuck
‎ Can you speak like a human?
‎ If you say listen to me, then listen carefully
‎ I 'm sorry. . .
‎ They gave me bad advice, and they also pointed out what to say
‎ - What to say? heck‎ - that is to say
‎ I rely on, I . . .
‎ I don 't know what to say to you
‎ okay?
‎ This is the truth
‎ I don 't know what to say‎ I don 't know what you want me to say
‎ I know because of me
‎ I 'm driving, it 's my fault
‎ I never told anyone‎ Because what 's the use of saying it? ‎ Or write it down . . . ‎ Leave a suicide note and shoot yourself?
‎ But what 's the use of that?
‎ but I want to say‎ I can tell you
‎ If I could get you to listen to me
‎ This is what you made
‎ I heard you did it on purpose

‎ When I started doing it‎ it was the same
‎ But I don 't know . . . ‎ Then it totally changed the tone
‎ is a step by step to become what it is now
‎ They said: 'Bill, keep optimizing the program to keep people sticking'

‎ You don 't have to do that
‎ Chris, you don 't have to be like that
‎ I killed her and can 't live on
