 - Hiya . - Hi .
 God , that was so fast . I didn 't realize you 'd be parked right here .
 - Yeah , just dropped somebody off .
 - Oh , it 's my lucky day then .
 [ woman ] I 'm going to Old Street ... Oh , you 've got the details .
 So you work in that place ?
 Hmm ?
 - Sorry , miles away , I didn 't catch that .
 - [ chuckles ] Is that where you work , where I picked you up ?
 At Smithereen ? No .
 Just visiting .
 I mean , I wish I worked there .
 The facilities they 've got in there , they 've got their own spa . It 's madness .
 That 's Billy Bauer money for you .
 Anyway .

 My daughter 's name was Kristin
 Krissie .
 Twenty years old . She was at university .
 She killed herself , took her own life , whatever you wanna call it , 18 months ago now .
 And it was out of the blue .
 One of her flatmates called me .
 They 'd found her in the bathroom .
 And I 'm furious with her !
 I 'm so fucking angry with her for not telling me .
 I thought I knew , I ...
 [ sobs softly ] I didn 't know .
 Last time I spoke , she was happy ... and just like that , she ended everything .
 [ sniffs ] And I don 't know why she did it .
 I 've asked myself why a million times .
 Was it over some boy or her course or the state of the world or me ?
 Was it something I did ?
 Round and round in my head but there 's no answer , there 's nothing .
 She 's not here to say , so ... it 's never gonna stop , this ... needing to know .
 It 's never gonna stop .
 [ vending machine clattering ]
 Talk about nerve- racking .
 [ chuckles ]
 That was my first time speaking .
 I mean , in front of everyone . Tough crowd .
 Oh , you did really well . - Really ?
 - Yeah .
 First time , though , shit scary , isn 't it ?
 Well , to be honest , I don 't know .
 Have you ...
 You haven 't spoken while I 've been here . I mean , is it ...
 I just haven 't found the right moment yet .
 Waiting for the right moment .
 - Anyway .
 - Hey , um , do you fancy a drink ?
 Oh , I 've got a bit of a long day tomorrow . Come on .
 Might die tomorrow .
 [ chuckles ] Joke .
 [ woman ]
 Oh , God . Oh , my God .
 [ groans ]
 Oh , my God .
 I needed that .
 [ breathing heavily ]
 It 's okay .
 It 's okay .
 - I wanna make you cum , too .
 - In a bit maybe .
 - Just need a bit ... bit of a breather .
 - It 's been ages .
 Can 't even remember the last time .
 - Sorry , do you mind if I ... ?
 - No , no , no .
 I know these things are undignified .
 Went on a date about four months back with a guy off an app .
 Halfway through the starter , I tell him about Kristin .
 He reacted like I said I 'd got cancer .
 That 's her .
 Ah .
 Her flatmate sent that to me . It was in her room .
 [ phone beeps , vibrates ]
 Shit . Okay , give me a minute .
 I 'm trying to get into Kristin 's Persona account .


 I try logging in every day .
 It gives you three wrong guesses , then locks you out for hours .
 Every time I think of a guess , I write it in here .
 This week I 'm into places we went on holiday .
 I 'm her mum .
 You 'd think they 'd give me the password to my own daughter 's account , but , no .
 Violates their privacy policy .
 They 'll memorialize it if you prove you 're next of kin .
 Makes it sort of sepia with a tribute photo , but that deletes the inbox .
 I just want the inbox .
 I don 't know , see if there 's a reason , an answer .
 I don 't know what I want . Okay .
 Right .


 [ sighs ]
 Okay .
 Well , there 's tomorrow .

 I 'm on my way now .

 Uh- huh .
 My first- class check- in San Francisco flight 's not for another three hours , so there should be time .
 Yeah , yeah , I 'm hopping in the car now .
 Okay .
 Okay , bye .
 Uh , uh , airport , yeah ? Terminal Three .
 - Do you work in that place ?
 - Smithereen ? Yeah .
 [ phone vibrates ]
 The sat nav 's showing an accident coming up .
 Do you mind if I follow an alternate route it 's showing me ?
 It 's actually quicker than the normal way .
 - Uh , yeah , that 's fine .

 Is this about money ?

 - What are you doing ? - What did you say ?
 - What did you say ? - I 'm just an intern .
 With a suit , the luggage , the ... suitcase ? Why are you going to the airport ?
 It 's outfits . Clothes are in there for Vanessa .
 - Who the fuck is Vanessa ? - Vanessa Lampton .
 She 's an exec at Smithereen .
 Her stylist told me that I need to go to Heathrow .
 She 's got a bunch of outfits and she 's gotta pick one . That 's my job , man .
 I 'm just an intern .
 So why are you dressed like that ?
 That 's a suit . - You 're wearing a fucking suit .
 - It 's my first week .
 Oh , fuck !
 Fuck !
 Fuck !
 Okay .
 - Fuck ! - Fuck !
 Modern fucking companies !
 Everyone looks so fucking young !
 How is anybody looking in supposed to have a sense of the fucking hierarchy ? !
 Jesus Christ !
 Half of you cunts coming out of the building are dressed like fucking gap- year students .
 I mean , what ... ? Fuck !
 Children .
 The whole Smithereen building is a box full of fucking children getting their fingers everywhere .
 Beep , beep , beep , beep , beep ... Wiping your shit .
 Your fucking app shit up on everybody 's phone .
 Everywhere you look , people are hooked on the things !
 It 's like chain- smoking .
 Did you make a lot of cash out of that , did you ? And you lot are hooked on them as well .
 Every single person that comes out of that building 's going ...
 People don 't even look up anymore . The sky could turn fucking purple and you cunts wouldn 't notice for a month .

 You didn 't look up and look where that got you , sitting in the back like that .
 An intern . Why didn 't you dress like a fucking intern ? !
 Jesus !
 All right , work with it , work with it . Work with ...
 Fuck .
 - Stop ! Stop ! - Don 't kill me .

 I won 't run . - Move . Shut up !
 - Get in . Get in the car .
 - Please !
 - Get in the car . - No , no ! - Don 't put me ...
 - Get in !
 - Look , I can 't go in there . - Get in , get in .
 I can 't go in there . I 've got claustrophobia , man .
 I 'm claustrophobic .
 Please , please , please ! - Get in .
 - Please don 't put me in there .
 Just get in .

 It looked like someone with a bag on their head .

 No , let 's check it out .
 Just get fucking down !

 - He 's probably in America or ...
 Look , how do I ...
 I don 't know Billy Bauer .
 I know , I know you don 't know him , but you 'll know someone who knows someone who knows him .
 - From your company . - I 've only been there one week .
 I don 't even know anyone 's name .
 Okay , so who 's the highest- ranking person that you do know ?
 Uh , Hannah .
 Yeah , Hannah Kent in HR .
 She 's sort of in charge of me .
 Okay . Okay .

 - What ?
 - Have you got her number in your phone ? - Uh , yeah .

 So can I have it ?

 - What 's her number ?
 - Um , I don 't know . I 'd tell you , I 'd totally tell you if I knew it .
 Would Hannah recognize your voice on the phone ?
 - Yeah , probably , yeah .
 - Right , so you could call reception or the front desk or whatever , ask for Hannah ?
 I don 't know . I 've never had to do that yet .
 - That 's okay . - But I don 't have my phone .
 I 've got one . I 've got one .
 Don 't fucking try anything .
 I 'm not gonna try anything .

 - Who needs to speak to Billy Bauer ?
 The man does , the gunman .
 Okay , Jaden , I don 't know what you 're talking about .
 Can you slow down ? I don 't understand what ...
 - Look , I 'm ... - Listen carefully .
 I 've got a gun . I 've got your employee .
 And I 'm going to shoot him unless you get me Billy Bauer on the phone right now .
 I 'm serious .
 The police are here . They 're looking at me .
 I 'm stuck here , I 've got a fucking gun . There 's not much time .
 I didn 't want to do it like this but I need to speak to Bauer now .
 Okay .
 Is this a joke ?
 - No . - No !

 I think he just took a photo .
 [ phone chimes ]

 Yes .

 - Yes .
 Don 't hurt him .

 I just wanna speak with Billy Bauer on ... on the phone .

 I can try to .
 Can you stay on the line ?

 Here comes the hotstepper .
 - Get a cordon going . - Come on , lads .
 - Did you get a look at the hostage yet ?
 - Yeah . Hood 's off , he 's in the back . Early twenties , by the looks of him .
 - This is David Gilkes , negotiator .
 - Either of you speak to the suspect ?
 For like a second when he pulled the gun .
 - He seem pissed up ? On something ? - No , just angry .
 Let 's cut back on the razzmatazz .
 I know it 's tense but we 're not risking a shit storm
 like the whole Stretton thing with poor old Mr. Starter Pistol .
 - Ma 'am , I ... - Yes , I know but he was unarmed and it was less than a month ago .
 Memories aren 't that short yet .
 So no critical shot unless there 's absolutely no choice .
 - Okay ? - Ma 'am .
 - Your lace is undone .
 - Ma 'am , they 've ID 'd the car .
 It 's registered to an Eleanor Kathleen Gillhaney , sixty- seven years old , listed under an address in Ewelme .
 - That 's , what , couple of miles from here ?
 - Yeah .
 - I know Ewelme .
 - Okay , you two go and give it a knock . - See if she 's okay .
 - Yes , ma 'am .
 Ma 'am , I 'm gonna get these cars out of the way .
 Right .
 [ camera clicks ]
 Pen , we have to tell Billy what 's happening .
 [ sighs ]
 If this thing ends in a shoot- out , he should at least be aware of the situation .
 - Got a hit . - He could start making other demands .
 - One moment , Don . What is it ?
 - Okay , the cell he 's calling from , I ran it through everything and got a match .
 It 's registered as a two- step verification number on this account .
 Pull out whatever we can get on this guy . He 's still on hold , right ?
 Got him listening to a playlist .

 Billy Bauer .
 You know , he 's not gonna pay a ransom on me .
 He doesn 't even know who I am .

 - Do they know if it 's a terror thing yet ? - No one knows anything .
 You should just go home .
 - Timeline 's going nuts .
 - Let 's see .

 - Ma 'am .
 We know who the hostage is . He 's from Smithereen .
 - The social whatever company ?
 - Yeah . They contacted the Met to say one of their interns is being held at gunpoint .

 Jaden Tommins .
 The gunman sent a photo .
 Shit .
 He 'd been sent on an errand .
 They booked a cab through the Hitcher app .
 He 's not in a cab now .
 Call Hitcher , get what we can on the driver .
 - We got the number that sent that photo ?
 - Yep . Run the call data through intel .
 What did he say to them ? - Did he give a name ?
 - He wouldn 't tell them anything but he did say he needs to speak to Billy Bauer on the phone .
 Billy Bauer as in Billy Bauer ?
 [ " Can 't Take My Eyes Off You " playing on phone ] - [ Penelope ]
 - I 'm here .


 That 's right . So have you got Billy Bauer on the line ?
 - Sorry .
 Uh , yes . We 're doing everything we can .
 May I speak to Jaden ?
 - He 's fine .
 - I just need to check he 's okay .
 - Tell them you 're okay .
 - Uh , I 'm okay .
 There . So you 'd better hurry up and get Billy Bauer on the phone .

 - That 's not my problem .
 Well , meantime could you maybe outline what this is regarding ?

 Sure , it 's just ...
 I 'm actually the COO . Okay . And ?

 Just fucking get Billy Bauer on the phone right now . I 'm not fucking around here .


 - I 'm sorry , of course , I apologize .
 I 'm gonna put you back on hold . I promise you we are working on it .
 Don 't be long !
 [ exhales ]
 Well , he 's not stable .
 Oh , in what way , Don ? Jesus Christ .
 I don 't think that music helped him any .
 But I switched the line so now while he 's hearing that , we can listen in to see what 's happening at his end .

 - On his own ? - Yeah , keeps to himself .
 Drives to work each morning , think he works somewhere in London .
 Has something happened to him ?
 Got a positive ID on the suspect . Name 's Christopher Gillhaney .
 Okay .


 What have you got on the suspect ?
 Former teacher .

 - Well , he was a teacher . IT .

 - How 's his record ?

 Only place he shows up is as a victim
 Drunk driver plowed right into him .
 Two dead , including the drunk .
 - Okay , good work , Najma .
 Teacher with a real gun ?
 - Not impossible , but not likely .
 - Ma 'am , it 's the FBl .
 - What ?
 - It 's the FBl . Urgent call .
 Chief Superintendent Grace .
 Hi , Chief Superintendent .
 This is Ernesto Cruz from the FBl .
 Right . Sorry , what 's this regarding ?
 We 're liaising with Smithereen , Silicon Valley .
 They 're also on this call .
 What , they 're on the line as well ?
 Yes , hi , this is Penelope Wu from Smithereen .
 With me is Don from legal and Shonelle from analytics .
 Uh , David Gilkes , negotiator .
 Listen , Ms. Wu , we 've identified the suspect .
 thirty- three years old .
 He has a Smithereen profile .

 but we are able to listen in to his end of the line so we 'll share live feed of that with you guys .
 Yeah . That 's useful .
 perhaps you could share with us your perception of what he 's doing .
 Probably extortion , whether it 's targeted at your company is something we don 't ...
 Oh , it 's targeted .
 - Sorry ?
 Group- wise we 'd slot him into high intellect , low income .
 Often angry people .
 if he 'd ever expressed hostile sentiments towards Smithereen as an entity but nothing shows up on his social .
 In fact , there 's been nothing there at all for some time .

 - I don 't see how this is relevant .

 is registered to an Omar Masimbalu .
 - Right .

 - No .

 People trade them on the dark web . Seems likely Chris got a hold of it that way .
 You appreciate what I 'm saying ?
 - He 's been covering his tracks .

 he 'd been only accepting jobs specifically outside the Smithereen London address .

 Just parked up each day waiting until he got a job from someone



 His record 's totally clean .
 - I mean , he was the victim in ...

 He lost his fiancée in that crash . Were you aware of that ?

 No .
 But you are .
 condolences , memorials , and that 's when Chris disengages , in fact , not interacting with friends even though he 's expressing grief .

 You 've done your homework . Okay , I 'm thinking this isn 't about money .
 - [ Grace ] - Go on .
 Chris is about the same age as Bauer , right ?
 They 've both got geeky backgrounds , computers .
 - David . - Maybe even Chris thinks it 's about money but it 's actually about status .

 Bauer 's got money , power , respect .



 What if Christopher thinks he wants what Bauer 's got ?
 [ chuckles ] But really , it 's just about getting his attention .
 What if that 's what 's going on ?
 Is that gonna help you talk him out of that car ?
 If he 'll listen to me , yeah .
 [ loudspeaker feedback ]
 [ David , through loudspeaker ]
 Christopher !
 Hello , Christopher ?
 Christopher , my name is David Gilkes .
 I 'm David , okay ?
 If you can see me , I 'm the berk waving his arm in the air , okay ?
 The one in the cheap suit .
 Listen , there 's a whole load of police here and to be honest , they 're just doing their jobs but I think they 're worried you 're gonna hurt yourself or someone else .

 I don 't think you will , Christopher , but I 'm not sure that they think that .
 You know how they get .
 [ phone chimes , vibrates ]
 - Chris , that 's me calling you , Chris .
 - Oh , leave me alone .
 I just wanna talk to you for a moment .
 [ Grace ]
 No clear shot yet .
 Hostage is directly behind the gunman .
 [ phone chimes ]
 Can you shut up , please ?
 [ Grace ] , can you hand me that ?

 - [ Chris ]
 - My name is David ...
 Thanks for that , David . Are you the negotiator ?
 Well , some people call me that , but really I 'm just a ...
 I 've read up about negotiators .
 You 'll pretend to be my friend and then you 'll slowly try to convince me to give myself up .
 Chris , you 're obviously a smart guy so I won 't bullsh ...
 And if gentle persuasion doesn 't work , you 'll keep me distracted on the phone
 long enough for one of your snipers to get a good head shot .
 Is that right , David ?
 Well , look , let 's just try to ...
 No , no , let 's just you fuck off .
 Get off the line . I 'm waiting for Billy Bauer .
 Okay , you 're the guy in the cheap suit , yeah ? - That 's what you said ?
 - Yeah . Uh- huh . Okay , so here 's what 's gonna happen .
 I 'm gonna count to a hundred .
 - Chris .
 And if I don 't see you get in your car and fuck off right away ,
 I 'll blow his fucking head off !
 - One , two ...

 - No , if I shoot , I 'll kill them both . - four , five ...
 - six , seven , eight , nine ...
 - He 's bluffing .
 David , we can 't risk it . You know we can 't .
 I will blow his fucking head off .

 Agent Cruz , could you give us a moment please ?
 Sure .
 Yep .

 We have to tell Billy what 's happening . Billy 's not here , okay ?
 I can 't just call him up .
 Where is he ?
 He 's six days into a ten- day silent retreat .
 - A silent retreat ?
 - Just him alone , not speaking to anyone , total isolation .
 He 's done tech detox weekends here and there , but ten days .
 And I 'm very reluctant to step into that .
 But you do know where he is , right ?
 Well , he doesn 't know it but of course I do .

 Mr. Bauer ?
 Hello ?
 Hello ?
 Mr. Bauer ?
 [ knocks gently ]
 I 'm so sorry to interrupt but there 's a situation you need to know about .
 Someone in the United Kingdom has taken one of our interns hostage and they 're threatening to kill him unless they can speak to you on the phone .

 Oh , fuck .
 [ helicopter overhead , radio comms ]
 And he nearly hit us and then , he just crashed into that field over there .
 That 's when they shouted , " Gun . "
 Stay back , ladies and gents .
 [ " Can 't Take My Eyes Off You " playing ]
 - [ computer chimes ] - He just logged in . Like , right now .
 What 's he doing ? Looks like he 's looking at posts from bystanders at the scene .
 How old are you ?
 Twenty- two .

 Have you got a girlfriend ?
 - Or a boyfriend ? Partner ?
 Whatever ? - Not at the moment .

 - I wanna talk to the guy . - [ Penelope ]
 Legally and personally , I strongly advise against that .
 What do you do if he asks for a million dollars ?

 - We cannot give money ...
 I 'm talking about buying us some more time .
 The moment any kind of transaction gets mentioned ...
 Jesus , fuck the fucking money !
 Holy shit !
 To be blunt , Mr. Bauer , for all we know , this guy 's planning on executing the hostage the moment he has you on the line .
 I don 't get that feeling .
 [ sighs ]
 I don 't think we can trust feelings on this .
 [ chuckles ]
 Well , maybe that 's part of the problem .
 I wanna talk to him .
 They 've got a news van as well .
 [ sighs ]
 My mum will be terrified .
 She worries about me all the time and this is ...
 Your mum 's got nothing to worry about .
 - Yes , she does , she ... - It 's not real .
 The gun , it 's not real .
 - What ?

 - Fuck ! - [ man ] Stand by , stand by .
 [ Grace ] We don 't wanna spook him . We want him getting bored .
 Ma 'am . It 's not real .
 - What ?
 - His gun , he 's just told Jaden it 's not real , it 's a replica . Guys , I 've just been told the gun 's not real .
 The gun 's not real .
 We heard that at our end . Oh , thank God .
 Thank God .
 We 'll deal with him now , if you 'll excuse me .
 Thank you .
 - Simon , I 'll need a vest . - Ma 'am ?
 Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey !
 Don 't move . Don 't try to get out .
 I 've got the child lock on and they 've got real guns out there .
 We start struggling about , they could hit either one of us .
 Billy , this is a live feed from the gunman 's cell .

 - Okay , uh ...

 - Jesus . Okay .
 - [ Jaden ] - [ Chris ]


 Looks like the gun is not real .


 - What did he say ? - Well , it 's not a real gun .
 [ indistinct radio comms ]
 [ " Can 't Take My Eyes Off You " playing ]
 Uh , someone 's coming , someone 's coming .
 What the fuck ... ?

 The gun is real !
 Get back ! Get back ! - The gun is real !
 - Got a clear view for critical shot .
 - Get back over there ! - Chris , we need to stop this now .
 It 'll stop when I speak to Billy Bauer ! - Then it 'll stop !
 - He 's in America .
 They can 't contact him yet .
 Fuck off . They must have told him by now . You 're just biding time .
 No one 's biding time . We 're taking this all very seriously .
 Now why don 't you let Jade ... [ gunshot ]
 - Shot authorized .
 - [ gunshot ]
 - [ yells ]
 - Ah !
 Fuck ! Can 't see .
 No clear view for a critical shot .
 [ male officer ] Everyone back behind cover , now .
 You 're okay . You 're okay .
 You are listening in , so listen to this .




 I 'm fucking doing it .
 That 's final .
 Okay ? It 's final .
 [ breathes heavily ]
 I lied about the gun .
 I 'm sorry .
 - Pen ?
 Pen , are you still there ?

 Put me through . Put me through to this guy .
 Sir , you ... you can 't do that .
 Excuse me , please don 't tell me what I can and can 't do , okay ?
 - Pen , cut him off .
 - Billy ...
 [ Cruz ]
 I suggest you do not engage with this individual .
 - Cut him off now !
 - Bill , don 't ... [ phone beeps ]
 [ dial tone drones ]
 All right , Pen , give me his number .
 - Bill .



 Bill , I 'm not gonna give you that .
 Did everyone catch the same disease today ?
 I didn 't ask you .

 Uh ...
 My laptop in there ?
 - Yeah .
 - And a sat link ? - Yes .
 Fuck it . I 'll get it myself .
 - Peace .
 Bill .
 Uh , what did Penelope say ? Can you make a note for me ?
 Christopher Michael Gillhaney .
 - Christopher Michael Gillhaney .
 - UK , user since '08 , didn 't log on for 18 months .
 Uh- huh .
 Sorry , what 's your name ?
 Tipi .
 Hi , I 'm Billy .
 Oh .
 [ chuckles softly ]
 Tipi , really the only good thing about my position is every once in a while I get to invoke ...
 God- mode .
 [ helicopter overhead ]
 [ phone rings , vibrates ]


 [ Billy ]

 Yeah , I 'm here .
 It 's me .



 - I did . I did , yeah .
 I do .
 Okay , well , uh ... you got me on the line .
 Tell you what , why don 't you let our guy Jaden there go and , uh ...

 - If I let him go , you 'll hang up .
 - I 'm not gonna hang up , Christopher .
 - I 'm listening .
 Let 's just not ... blow up , okay ?
 Let 's just , you know , be calm
 I just told you . I want you to listen to me .

 - I 'm listening .
 There 's no one else here .
 Okay , Chris ?
 It 's just ... it 's you and me .

 - Chris ?

 I 've rehearsed this though , and I just ...


 You run Smithereen .
 Uh- huh . Since 2008 .

 - Okay .


 I was the whole cliché , you know , first thing I saw in the morning , last thing I saw at night .
 Tamsin was ...
 [ sobbing softly ]


 Tamsin was the same . She was my fiancée .
 Three years ago ...
 I was driving home with her .
 We 'd been visiting my mum .
 My mum was sick and we 'd been visiting my mum and I was driving Tamsin back to our flat .
 She was asleep .




 - [ phone vibrates ]


 There 's this little notification thing saying someone liked a comment that I made about some photo of theirs .
 I just glanced at it , you know .
 That 's all the time it took .
 [ crash , glass shattering ]
 [ metal groans , tires screech ]
 It took her two months to die .
 I was at her bedside .
 It was no use .
 The man in the other car died , too .
 [ Chris sobs ]


 Everyone felt sorry for me . Mr. Tragic .
 Even her parents .
 At her funeral , you know , her mum was comforting me .
 Her fucking mum .
 What could I say to her ?
 Nobody wants to hear that their daughter 's dead because I was looking at me fucking phone .

 - [ whispers ] It 's Pen .





 Because how I feel is that I fucking killed her .
 I killed her .
 [ sobs ]
 Me .
 I killed her over a fucking ... dog photo .
 I killed her over that .

 I hear you .
 What ?


 Of course you fucking hear me .

 You sound like you 're in a lot of pain . Oh , Jesus fucking Christ !
 Speak like a fucking human being !
 You said you hear me so fucking hear me .
 I 'm sorry . Okay ?
 I 'm sorry . They gave me bullshit advice . - Fucking talking points .
 - I know .
 Fuck ! I 'm ...
 I don 't know what to say to you .
 Okay ?
 That 's the truth .
 I don 't know what to say . I don 't know what you want me to say .
 I know it was me .
 It was me . I was driving . It was my fault .
 or I could write it all down and leave a ... a note , shoot myself , but what good would that do ?

 But I thought I could tell you .
 If I could get you to listen .

 I heard that that you make these things that way .
 Addictive .

 Well , job done .
 Bit of user feedback for you there .
 Maybe factor that into your next update . [ sniffs ]
 I 'm so sorry about your girl .
 Truly . I 'm , uh ...
 It wasn 't supposed to be like this .
 Our whole platform , I swear to God .
 It was ... like , it was one thing when I started it and then it just ...
 I don 't know , it just became this whole other fucking thing .


 Until it was more like a crack pipe .
 It was like some kind of fucking Vegas casino where ...
 And we 'd sealed off all the fucking doors . They 've got a department ...
 All they do is tweak it like that on purpose .
 They 've got dopamine targets and there 's nothing I can do to stop it .
 I started it .
 There 's nothing I can do to fucking stop it .
 I 'm like some kind of ... fucking bullshit front- man now .
 I swear to God , I 've been on this retreat , supposed to be for ten days ...
 After , like , day two ,
 - Hey .
 - Hey . Shut up !
 - No way I 'm ...

 Beat yourself up or fucking run a victory lap , I don 't care .
 I just wanted to say my piece .

 Chris ... you gonna let our guy go ?
 - Of course I am .

 I 'm going to . I always was , all along .
 And now I 'm out of here .
 - as in ...

 - No . No , what ?
 Don 't ...
 You don 't have to do that .

 I can 't stay here , not after what I did to her .
 - I have to .
 You don 't have to waste your life .
 [ laughs ]
 It is wasted .
 [ Chris breathes shakily ]
 If there 's anything that I can do , Chris ,
 There 's gotta be something that I can do , even if it 's something small .
 There 's gotta be one small thing that I can do for you .


 [ breathes deeply ]
 Do you know the guy who owns Persona ?
 Yeah , I know Curtis .
 Sure .
 [ phone rings ]
 - Hello ?
 Speaking .


 You have ?
 He 's spoken to him .
 I 'm gonna let you go now , Jaden .
 Okay ?
 Thanks .
 You can get up .
 Careful , careful .
 No sudden movements now .
 We don 't wanna spook them , okay ?
 Hold out your wrists .
 He 's cutting him free .
 I 'm sorry for putting you through all of this .
 - It 's okay .
 - [ chuckles ]
 Come on , come on , what 's taking ...
 Don 't kill yourself , man .
 Seriously , my uncle killed hisself and it fucked my whole family up .
 My mum 's still a mess .
 I 'll go out there right now and then I 'll tell all of them , I 'll tell them that you didn 't hurt me .
 That 's very good of you . That 's very kind of you .
 But I don 't wanna be here anymore .
 I won 't do it until you 're away from the car .
 - Seriously , you don 't wanna do this ...
 - I know you mean well , but , please , just please get out of the car .
 Please .
 Oh , I can 't get out the car , you left the child lock on .
 [ coughs ]
 Oh , no , no , no .
 Please , don 't . - Just leave me to it .
 - You don 't have to do this !
 They 're struggling . Have you got a clear shot ?
 Affirmative .
 Shot authorized .

 [ whispers ]
 Fuck .

 - [ gunshot ]
 - [ Chris yelling ]
 [ gasping ]
 - [ Jaden ]
 Fuck .
 - [ grunts ]
 - Just drop it , man !
 - No .
 Target missed .
 Authorized .
