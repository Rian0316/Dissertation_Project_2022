‎ Before you know it, she will influence everyone 's thoughts
‎ Okay, we 'll pay more attention
‎ Happy Birthday!
‎ I baked a cake!
‎ - Why didn 't you say today is your birthday? ‎ - because I hate birthdays
‎ Nobody Hates Birthday Maeve
‎ On this day someone gave birth to me without my consent‎ Why should I celebrate?
‎ Think of these nihilistic wisdom
‎ If you weren 't born the world would be flawed
‎ happy birthday wish you a happy day
‎ Just tell him you like him
‎ What do you want to do on your birthday?
‎ not wanting to do anything
‎ What the hell happened to this cake?

‎ What?
‎ Do you think it will leave stains?
‎ I love these jeans
‎ You must report this
‎ It 's okay just a bargain
‎ No you were molested
‎ I think he 's just lonely‎ or having a problem with his head‎ It 's weird because he 's handsome
‎ Aimee this is serious
‎ It 's silly to be honest, I 'm fine
‎ Well I know what I want to do on my birthday
‎ Let 's go to the police station
‎ Where did you take Euler on your first date?
‎ We didn 't really date

‎ Just start hanging out together
‎ What does it mean?
‎ such as playing video games, chatting, eating cereal
‎ Otis that 's what you and I do

‎ Okay
‎ What 's your name?
‎ Malik Amir
‎ Malik Amir is happy to meet Malik
‎ I don 't have to pay for it, do I?
‎ no
‎ Ok so. . . ‎ What do you think is missing from the Sex and Relationships Education Course?
‎ It 's like I have a friend‎ who was dating a girl‎ who was covering his face with a pillow while they were in bed‎
‎ Can the course cover this?
‎ interesting
‎ It can be useful to include fetishes in the curriculum
Love habit?
‎ Yes there are literally hundreds of sex fetishes‎ You 'd never think of them‎ They usually start in adolescence
‎ Covering someone 's face during sex‎ may be a desire to engage in‎ choking or claustrophobic fantasies
‎ Although rare it can sometimes be
Love demon habit
‎ - Ghost fetish? ‎ - hmm
‎ A person covers someone else 's face‎ because they secretly want to have sex with a ghost or ghost
‎ So my girlfriend is crazy
‎ Didn 't you mean your friend 's girlfriend?
‎ I have to go
‎ so funny
‎ wow
‎ You wanna fuck ghosts?
‎ What?
‎ Whatever your face covering is‎ you have to deal with it‎ because it 's weird and scary‎ and makes me feel very unsafe

‎ Ok, I 'll take a form for you to fill out
‎ See this is the real trouble
‎ You 're in real trouble
‎ Potholes on the street Damn Council
‎ come on let 's go
‎ Basically‎ like he sneezed at me
‎ He came on you, Aimee?
‎ Yes
‎ Ejaculation is like sneezing on a penis
‎ Although this means that when you swallow someone 's semen‎ it is like eating someone 's snot
‎ please take a seat with us
‎ Hello, what are you doing?
‎ hi

‎ This is my friend Aimee
‎ She was molested on the bus
‎ I have cum on my jeans
‎ We may be wasting your time
‎ You didn 't waste anyone 's time, okay?
‎ Do you need to call someone?
‎ Do I need a lawyer? I 'm about to be arrested?
‎ no sorry i mean your mom or something
‎ Oh my god, she 'll make a fuss
‎ Alright please sit down and fill out these forms
‎ A police officer will come to you right away
‎ thank you
‎ you forgot the cake
‎ - Does anyone have a birthday? ‎ - Well my birthday

‎ I think it 's so cute
‎ Why do people always think old men are cute?
‎ How do you know‎

‎ This year 's school production of Romeo and Juliet ‎ is not just a play, but . . . ‎ Please hit the drums

‎ A musical!

‎ Who is excited?
‎ I 'm excited, okay?
‎ Lily Egghart of The Swingers‎ will be writing and assistant director‎ Auditions will be held tomorrow morning
‎ Guys, I really have a special feeling about this now.
‎ Everyone can take this opportunity to find their place‎ and shine
‎ Hey you forgot your audition lines
‎ What did I see?
‎Jackson Marchetti‎ Audition for low-level school drama?
‎ Are miracles endless?
‎ Actually, I don 't understand Mr. Shakespeare. It 's a book from heaven
‎ Well that 's the beauty of William 's Iambic
‎ ok thank you
‎ hello
‎ History lessons are not here
‎ No I 'm Michael 's wife Maureen
‎ I 'm sorry I 'm a rare sex educator

‎ hello
‎ This is Principal Grove 's dinner‎ I 'll deliver it on Wednesday
‎ He has to mark homework and work late
‎ - How are you getting along? ‎ - very good
‎ good yes i think i got the hang of it
‎ Yes
‎ When Michael was headmistress in his first term‎ he would come home crying most nights
‎ Don 't tell him I said it
‎ Anyway, glad you made it through
‎ thank you
‎ I don 't know if you can . . .
‎ Say what?

‎ Don 't know if you can . . . ‎ tell me that color of lipstick‎ where did you get it?

‎ so beautiful

‎ I don 't remember
‎ but next time you come ‎ you can come to me‎ I will tell you
‎ great
‎ - I 'd better bring Mr. Grumpy a meal‎ - ok
‎ Nice to meet you Jane
‎ each other Maureen
‎ Would you like to play at my house before the date?
‎ No I haven 't decided what to wear. What should I wear?
‎ - Wow what a major transformation‎ - Otis
‎ I don 't have time to say this I have to go home
‎ try all clothes on
‎ Maybe you should take off the scarf
‎ Maybe it 's time for you
‎ Olivia OMG!
‎ You almost lost your life
‎ Thanks to your mom my boyfriend thinks I want to kill him
‎ Why?
‎ Because I 'm like this sometimes‎ Well when I orgasm‎ I 'll put a pillow over his face‎ Now your mom thinks I have a fetish
‎ - Don 't you? ‎ - My face is ugly when I orgasm
‎ I 've seen it in the mirror before
‎ I 'm like a python swallowing an egg‎ and Malik is always perfect
‎ Well. . . ‎ Feeling spied on and vulnerable when sleeping‎ This is normal
‎ He may also feel stupid sometimes
‎ We may think we‎ look silly or unattractive‎ but sex is not always perfect‎ It should be about feeling good
‎ instead of looking beautiful
‎ Seeing a sexual partner as it was at the time is a privilege
‎ So you and your boyfriend‎ may need to develop trust in each other‎ so that you can fully present yourself in front of him‎ Your bits and pieces
‎ Even if you think it 's ugly
‎ Because he sure doesn 't think that way
‎ And. . . ‎ I think there is one thing that might work
‎ I got a B plus in my algebra
‎ You know it 's not a big deal, right?
‎ So you want to do your English or math homework today?
‎ Well . . .
‎ Actually I 'm thinking of auditioning for a drama at school‎ but I don 't know much about Shakespeare‎ I wonder if you can help me
‎ - not in my purview Math or English‎ - please
‎ Listen if it wasn 't for you‎ I would never get a B plus in my algebra
‎ You must have a good idea about Shakespeare, right?
‎ please
‎ You are not cute

‎ Why on earth did you want to audition?
‎ I followed your advice to find an alternative plan
‎ I played Joseph in my school 's ‎ Nativity play ‎ and people said I was real
‎ - Because you played Joseph‎ - please
‎ please
‎ You are a tutoring genius
‎ okay
‎ - but only this time‎ - hmm
‎ Read the lines to me
‎ - Now? ‎ - hmm
‎ okay
‎ okay
‎ ' That 's my crush, that 's my love
‎ - Oh wish she knew . . . ' ‎ - how do you seem to be reading
‎ - Like a shopping list? ‎ - because it 's like a book from heaven
‎ this is poetry
‎ Only when you master the rhythm, words are meaningful
‎ Each line has ten syllables containing five heartbeats
‎ Plop. . .
‎ you try

‎ 'Rise up, beautiful sun, drive away the jealous moon, she 's pale with anger'
‎ You have mastered the rhythm and words
‎ Emotions are needed now
‎ This line focuses on love
‎ So. . . ‎ When you say your lines, try to think of someone who makes you feel very


‎ Wish I could get my jeans back
‎ Do you really want to come back?
‎ Well, it 's the perfect bootleg Maeve‎ Rarely seen on the market
‎ That 's right
‎ - Do you think they are looking at us? ‎ - Well maybe

‎ - Oh! ‎ - No
‎ - Aimee‎ - I 'm sorry I 'm nervous


‎ I didn 't put it
‎ I 'm sorry I fart when I 'm scared
‎ it 's fine
‎ Well . . .

‎ So. . . ‎ Blonde, clean face‎ 1 m7 3 to 1 m7 5 . . . ‎ in blue coat
‎ is aqua blue
‎ Was he already on the bus when you got in?
‎ Yes
‎ I think yes
‎ he may be on the second stop
‎ It is very important to know at which stop he is getting on‎ so that we can try to make the situation as clear as possible
‎ You said you remember smiling at him
‎ Is that after the first or second stop?
‎ Sorry what does that matter?
‎ Are you saying she shouldn 't smile at him?
‎ This kind of charge is hard to convict‎ If we do catch the guy‎ The questions will be tougher
‎ Can you give me the jeans back?
‎ I 'm leaving, sorry I made a fuss
‎ Aimee . . .
‎ What if he does this to others?
‎ I know you can
‎ please?
‎ You did a great job Aimee
‎ Yes
‎ take your time
‎ try to think
‎ He was already in the car
