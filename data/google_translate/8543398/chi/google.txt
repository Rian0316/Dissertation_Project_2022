Wait a minute and play again?
Okay

clothing

This isn 't my first date to be taken to the hospital
I once ate undercooked chicken and it burned to 40 degrees and had hallucinations
Then you should get used to it

Fives. . .

I 'll take your blood pressure
OK
Let me see

The operation went well and the doctor is satisfied
Great
Median nerve damage is less likely to heal

You may have a dry mouth and a sore throat due to anesthesia Remember to drink plenty of water
i will stare at him
All right
- thank you - ok

How soon can I be discharged from the hospital?
not too long
about six hours

That. . .
listen to me, you go first
That . . . six hours is a bit long
Rob, come on, of course I 'm staying
In other words, you will stay

You don 't come to the hospital at all

And we 're still dating

completely forgot
more and more abstract
Possibly drug related
What happened to the other drug?
i have panic disorder

The word 'disorder' is used incorrectly
For some, it 's like a storm
But to me, it 's more like fog coming
I would . . . shut down the entire NPC and be completely socially unavailable
- I was going to tell you, but...
- I know
I won 't say such a thing unless I have to.
That 's right
Anyway - you look calm now - thanks


If you weren 't there, I 'd be terrified
Have a funny message?
Currently 87 likes, 17 comments
famous
I didn 't mention your name, to reassure you
What are you going to call me?
How about 'Martini Lovers'?
I like 'Martini Lovers'
A bit of decadent spy feeling will be equated with me from now on
get it
You should date a martini lover
'Rob' is too ordinary
Yasmine and . . .
Rob
Maybe just repack Rob
brand new rob
Can 't believe old Rob got this far
Passersby will look at you, look at me and think 'No way, they can 't be a couple'
That 's your own fantasy
That 's when I ask myself 'Do I look nervous?
'Worried this will make me look more nervous?
'Does she think I 'm a big otaku?'
Everyone is like that, Rob.
But it hits me too hard
So I don 't have much energy left to actually experience it
See what I mean?



Looks like there will be scars
is a souvenir
Better than getting your name tattooed on your arm
a guy did it for me
Why am I not surprised at all? Ex-boyfriend?

- do you mind? - no, please


Is it number one?
I 'm Dalla, not a savage


It feels like our relationship is turning around over the years

How to say?
People usually try to look my best but you 've seen my weakest side
fear, bloodshed
- Nude - that 's right
My worst fear came true
It 's not that bad, my bike accident must have been a shit.
Because then I just remember waking up in the ambulance with my face so swollen
- No way - the doctor said
They 'll cut a small incision in my head and put my cheekbones back in with a small spoon
Yeah, it sounds like it 's fine
Just as I was going through the anesthesia, the doctor said that the operation might not be successful.
Well, are there any other options?
Another option is to put a piece of steel in it
Right
But to do this kind of surgery the doctor has to cut my head open from left ear to right ear
- Tear the face off . . .
- All right, stop talking!
when they tell me this
my panic attacks the whole big attack
Then the anesthesia kicked in and I went to Wonderland
Yes, but everyone will react the same way
maybe
As it turns out, plan A was a success
but still scary
I can 't see which side you 're hurting on
very good
Which side?
here
Doctor is great
thanks

Damn
The Last of the Mohigans
My dad used to take that before he died
I am sorry

That is. . .
Cause of death?
didn 't help
Has he been ill for a long time?
Do you really want to hear this story?
The short version is that he has a severe brain hemorrhage
What about the full version?
It 's my 30th birthday
We had a big party with a bunch of family and friends
I didn 't climb into my boyfriend 's bed until about six o 'clock
The next morning my dad made breakfast and brought it to my mom in bed
She told me afterwards that they had sex and she took a shower and he slept
When she came out, his face collapsed and his speech was slurred
She called an ambulance, but it was too late
I stayed by his side the whole time in the hospital
I still remember the nurse bathing him and I went out for a walk
After washing, I looked at him through the curtain
He was naked and full of tubes, but the picture was beautiful
Like Michelangelo 's 'Santa' statue
Anyway, he died an hour later


- Are you sure you won 't eat something? - I can 't eat yet
I 'll just drink some water
- I 'll get it - No, it 's alright
I 'll get it, I can
- you sure? - Sure


Hello





Don 't ask me to get you another drink
Reasonable
Have you ever wondered what would happen if you were disabled?

Look, I just think about this kind of shit
What about you?
i will be bad
drowning in anger and self-pity
will definitely become an alcoholic
You mean the hardest kind?
Wow, it hurts more than my wound
sorry
Just say it
I 'll spend years fighting pointless lawsuits
Why are you talking so hard about yourself?
As long as a woman shows kindness to me
I 'll make her regret it right away
How to say?
I 'll deliberately misunderstand that she 's interested in me. If she doesn 't follow up, I 'll go crazy
Live like a big otaku
I don 't know you very well but it doesn 't sound like something you would do
Anyway, thank God this injury will be better for you and me
So what do you think would happen if I was disabled?
you will be super inspiring
- what about now? - of course
You will adjust yourself quickly
Dedicated to advocacy work
Join the Paralympic Archery Team
TED will come to you to speak, and beauty companies will come to you to shoot commercials
Okay, you 're going a little too far
Really, you 'll completely subvert 21st century standards of beauty
you are too exaggerated
I 'm on drugs

thanks
I didn 't know you smoked
In fact, I don 't smoke, it 's super evil
May I ask you a serious question?
OK
What happened to you and your ex-boyfriend?
We suddenly became very close before we knew each other long enough
Isn 't it nice sometimes?
This question is hard to answer
I am a difficult person to get along with

Your impression of me may be a little off
How to say?
Well, let 's take tonight
I stayed with you all night like a big hero, right?
- Well this one . . .
- I seem very considerate to everyone on the Internet
But what can I do? Going to a nightclub and seeing you tomorrow?
you have to say that . . .
I 'm a little too concerned about what other people think
Why are you talking so hard about yourself?
It 's not easy to admit, but you 've been giving me your heart
Everyone loves attention, Yasmine
Yes, but 8 7 likes let me down
OK
I want your neighbors to see me from the window and want me
I hope the nurse thinks I 'm the funniest girl he 's ever seen
Why do I want a stranger to fall in love with me?
So what? don 't hurt
It 's a control
As long as you know for yourself . . .
What do you think of the guys staring at me
That 's out of your control
I can, I did
What?
Well, my friends and I used to do this kind of thing in the subway station

We 'll race to get the most men 's attention on the escalator
How to do it?

eye contact

a smile
that 's it
I actually noticed
My ex-boyfriend noticed it too
He will show me
I 'll justify myself and convince him that he thinks too much
I 'm super bad

you are right
I 'm really good at dating but it 's really hard to get along for a long time
So we decided to calm down

To understanding
When did this happen?
a few weeks ago

I am sorry
no, it 's okay
after all
We didn 't talk about anything serious
are chatting
Serious enough about this

Did it go smoothly?

All right, I brought you some clothes and put them in the closet
thank you




How does my home look?
Like a murder crime scene





coffee
thanks
Danish or rolls?

- either - the rule is that you must answer
then danish
thanks
beautiful picture
Yes
I 'm surprised you can 't resist uploading on IG
I think so too, but unfortunately the phone is dead
I have to say . . .
I fantasize about you spending the night at my house and we 'll have breakfast together
It 's a little bit different from what I imagined
still possible
really? Even after tonight?
Please don 't have a panic attack

shot
Then again, it feels so good
don 't you think? so good

Come on, respect your beautiful new life

my new home, my mother
I 'll help you clean up
Would you like to help me move out?

Can I take a seat here?
OK
But I might have to lie flat
May I?

Can you get it for me?
- ok - thank you

- you are. . .
- I think. . .
- I 'll help you - can you? I have no idea
Thank you, so kind
Okay


Can I say a few words?

i really appreciate you

I mean it
I know we just met and there was nothing between us
I know you just ended a relationship and I 'm probably not a good match either
But I just want to say that it all means a lot to me anyway
Seriously, even if we don 't see each other again or you stay for a long time or something else could happen all this . . .
Yasmin, are you asleep?

What?
How much have you heard?
Rob, why do you keep talking?
I don 't know, sorry
never mind
