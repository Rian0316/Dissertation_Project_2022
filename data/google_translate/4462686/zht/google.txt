this is perfect
Besides . . . the proofreader murmurs we have to save money now
Once we have a steady income timeline, Menglong will drive to Geronimo every night for dinner
- Before that . . . - Exactly
Let 's make this wish come true together
Later, the director of Shenshan Xiaoxin muttered

Put your resignation letter in Howard 's office tonight
It 's officially informing him on his turf
You call Mesa Verde and the other clients tomorrow morning when he 's having a good time golfing
pull them over
Gotta start before him
- no - what not
you must act now
If you waited the 'right way' to tell Howard in person he would say 'resign' before you said the word
Just reaching out to Mesa Verde is enough Jimmy thanks for the advice but the point is
You are your lawyer and I am mine
I need the right way for me





Hi Kim, can I make a long story short?
I 'm a little busy
Of course thank you for taking the time to see me
I only need to take a few minutes
good what

Howard, can we speak in your office?
please
Thanks again for taking the time
You don 't have to beat around the bush
I probably know what you 're here for
The latest American drama download
Then you choose to go to Swekat and Cokeley
- what- i heard
grapevine
I don 't go to other law firms
I want to stand on my own
I 'm going to try an individual lawyer


I. . .

I realize this is what I should do
? The same week that Jimmy left Davis Main, you decided to leave us
This can 't be a coincidence
no
We will split the cost
Shared office but two people work independently
In every way . . . very smart
Howard
I want you to know that I value my time here
I am grateful for everything you and the law firm have done for me especially paying my tuition I am going to write a check to pay off the rest of the loan
Just need the accountant to give me the exact amount
Don 't take it as a gift
I do not know what to say
Thank you
you deserved
To be honest, I 'm a little envious
really why?
New beginning
I remember when I just graduated from law school
I have seriously considered listing my own business
- really - yes
I 'm ready to break into the world and change the world
Dad convinced me
Want me to join the business here and add an 'H' to the firm 's name
all is well
Kim I want to tell you that I always put pressure on you because I think you can keep pushing yourself
good luck
thanks



Help me call Kevin Wachtel at Mesa Verde Bank
Cancel all arrangements for this morning
I 'll call


Excuse me
Excuse me
Hi Peggy I 'm Kim
Hello
I would like to confirm the lunch scheduled for noon on Monday
Great, is Kevin coming too?
OK
I have something new to tell you before we meet













I am not a safe choice
Safe choice is Hamlyn McGill Associates
But I think I was the right choice
why
Are the suits you 're wearing now store-bought ready-to-wear?
don 't tell me this looks like
I wouldn 't ask if it was just like the store bought.
So why would you choose to make it to order?

Because that 's what suits you best
Every stitch and every thread is for you
Either you go suit the suit or it suits you
What if I wanted an entire warehouse of suits?
Need a lot of people to sew
How does a tailor accomplish this task alone?
I fully understand your bank 's need for expansion
Mesa Verde, as my sole client, must take all my energy
But if I can 't do it
I won 't take it
I won 't waste your time
and my time




Here you go, Kim, we 're in there
Just in time, I 'm looking at the house
- Kim this is Steve - hello
Steve is the intermediary here
- hello my name is Kim - nice to meet you
- Kim- is everything okay?

How
I think it 's a dentist 's office
The two dentists ' offices are the same size, and the furnishings are symmetrical
Come
The other is right next door, the two are next to each other
right here
But sharing a hall and a reception area is quite equal
and very efficient

There are also soundproof walls to isolate the sound of drills, screams, etc.
And this place is awesome
I think it 's here

gold
Yeah, it 's very soundproofed
steve can we be alone
fine
I go out and make a few calls
you speak slowly
Didn 't lunch go well?
Did Mesa Verde reject you?


I can 't figure it out
This is representative of good . . .
jimmy i got it
- You 've got Mesa Verde Bank. - Great.
Haven 't signed the official documents yet but the lunch is very
Very smooth
The situation was a bit dangerous, but Peggy helped me a lot by speaking for me
Once he was relieved... .
great high five
I 've prepared answers to every question and concern and I haven 't spoken ill of Hamlin McGill Associates at all, but I 'm passionate
And private service for sure because of that - of course - yeah

After all, how did they end up at Hamlyn McGill Associates in the first place?

It wasn 't because of me when we walked out of the restaurant
Peggy gave me a thumbs up when Kevin couldn 't see
Not an ordinary stick
is two
two double barrel guns
bang bang like this
I knew it
- I knew you could - really . . .
That 's great

What 's up
I love seeing you the way you are
Are we going to keep these chairs?
Are you saying you like this office?
let 's do it

no problem
just do it



Ernesto door unlocked
as usual

Ernesto
it 's me Chuck
Is Howard Ernesto with you?
no only me
I 've been waiting for the file for an hour
We 're going to file a case soon.
i know Chuck
There is a good chance that we . . .
We may be losing Mesa Verde Bank
lost we just took them
why are they going to find someone
Go to Kim Wexler

she resigned
Kim resigned
Howard

where is she going
Is Rich Swekat there?
or Reeves and Green
It 's not a job-hopping
she 's going it alone
what
This is really . . .
How is she going to do it alone?
Why would she go it alone
no reason
As for how she 's going to join forces with Jimmy

Did Kim and my brother become partners?
he is svengali
The characters in the novel Tribby use hypnotism to control the heroine
This guy is a hypnotist
Anyway About Mesa Verde Bank
I 'm going to gamble
Chuck
- Mesa Verde Bank - I 'm listening
I got a chance to meet Kevin Wachtel
he arrives in the afternoon
But I don 't know which laws to follow
So if you have any arguments, let me know now
I only have an hour
Chuck
I really need your help
Chuck

are you OK
I also go to the meeting
Maybe it 's not good for Chuck
I can
I will persevere with willpower
And I 'm better
I know but . . . think about our message
I know to be professional and not crazy
I 'm going to the meeting, turn on the lights for me
Everyone has a cell phone
everything works fine

I 'll make it through


please come in
here they are
OK



Hello everyone
- sorry for being late - hello
Not exactly none we just sat down
Kevin Watchtel Paige Novick
This is Charles McGill. Just call me Chuck.
nice to meet you Kevin Page
Very happy to see you

Thank you both for coming
do not worry
Please come here not to listen to my bragging about HHM
I guess you 've had enough
Howard 's hard sell to the law firm, I think you 've heard enough.
It 's not hard selling, it 's just hospitality
I even got them cookies
I remember the cookies were delicious
I 'm here today to reassure you
Kim Wexler is indeed the right man to handle the Mesa Verde business
choose her wisely
She 's young and bright and has a bright future
Let 's face it Howard
she is the future
Old people like us are outdated
It 's a sad view
sad but true

Banking Law . . . Requires Passion
Need the next generation of rising rookies to inject fresh blood into it
really wake it up
I tell you how boring I am
I pass the time by reading FEC and ISO reports
yes i can prove it
I want to try to keep up with the trend
Rules are changing all the time
After the accident of Enron and WorldCom, the government was extra vigilant
Now even the most unintentional mistakes can have devastating consequences
You need a young and keen eye to grasp these trends
When you 've been in the field for over a decade it can become a little bit . . .
- stale - stale
you 're going to be stale
You forget about things like the Community Reinvestment Act
Banks like Mesa Verde that want to open new branches must demonstrate a healthy portfolio that complies with the bill
joking of course
I 'm sure you 've all done this well
The Rigg-Neal Interstate Banking and Branch Benefit Act is a mouthful
boring
But if you break the law, you could end up with years of lawsuits
By the way, if this happens to you without us, but of course not
Howard has someone at the Fed who can help with these things
one or two
And SEC Interpretation of Sarao Act Section 302


Be careful and you can save hundreds of thousands
they know howard
Feel sorry
When a person reaches a certain age, he will become a little verbose, always talking about some details
What I 'm trying to say is that your bank is in reliable hands
I understand what you 're trying to say really
but i will say
I have a lot of confidence in Ms. Wexler
you should be so
she was on our team
she taught us
Couldn 't find a better fit than Kim Wexler
But no matter how good she is, Mesa Verde 's business is too heavy to do alone
I will not handle your future expansion alone
So you should reconsider leaving it to a professional team like us
- It 's a pleasure to meet you - any time
We are always at your disposal
nice to meet you Paige
thank you too
see you gentlemen

Chuckna . . .

it 's awesome
you are amazing
Really . . . Chuck

send me home

Ernie
hold on



We still want to thank you for hosting the Major
what a joke it 's my pleasure
Make a small exception for war heroes
thank you very much
Major Talbot 's grandson is only in town for one more day and it 's great that they can share the experience with him
This will be an experience you will never forget
Are you excited?
yeah very excited

no i . . . i 'm their lawyer
Help if you can, so I called you
glad to serve you
that 's her
Gentlemen, this is the last in-service B 2 9 Super Flying Fortress in the world.

Major Theodore 'Fudge' Talbot
His mom would send him fondant heart packs during the war he would distribute to his friends
That 's true, folks
- yeah- yeah
Sir, this must have brought back your memory.

He said 'too much'
I must say Major Talbot is my pleasure
Thank you for serving the country

He said 'you 're welcome'
I really envy you
You must have heard his story
any good stories
- mostly about bombing - about bombing
such as war
Did he fly over the Himalayas or from India?

are you alright do you want water
good

I forgot his water
I can go back to the office and get him a bottle
is it okay
Captain Gummy said he was going back to the office
Can I get you some water, sir?


ok great
Don 't worry, he 's alright
i 'll be back soon
get up
don 't tell you anything
Just stand in front and go to the nose of the plane.
Where the hell did you get this guy
Can 't you find a real war hero
You think it 's so easy to find this guy owes me
I defend him when he has no money
- defend him what - how
Do you want to be a lawyer when you grow up
fixed that . . .
Masturbating in public
utter nonsense
alright, lower your voice
you have no right to speak
good start
hurry up
good hands on hips
Okay, be strong and proud
Shoot the bomber bomber is the point to shoot it
I 'm filming the damn bomber
Can 't you put this guy in front of the flag?
why don 't you come here
Because the production level is high and the performance is required
Is it filming?
- yes it 's filming - it 's filming
good to start mirroring
Start
you are the greatest generation
you fought nazis
beat the Japanese
- what- I hit the Japanese
I beat the Japanese
This plane was used in the Pacific theater to fight Japan
why don 't you shut up and follow the directions
Japanese who don 't smoke within 100 feet
well
you fought all the dirty Axis powers
You group of brothers united to save the world
you are a big hero
a bit past
Just show a little
good very good
Patriotism runs in your blood
look up
Saw a bald eagle soaring into the sky
The death
- what 's the matter - you guys keep shooting
Close-up and wide-angle shots are fine. Just take a good angle.
back to square one
back to square jelly
fudge look here fudge
what 's the matter ernie
Jimmy, I 'm with your brother, he 's not doing well

how bad is bad
He . . . I can 't tell, just keeps shaking
I 've never seen him like this
Keep telling me not to go to the doctor
let me guess
he went to the office
yes and
He had an important meeting today
ok you do this
wrap him in a space blanket
He 's already wrapped
another coat
Get him some tea, or better yet, hot chicken soup
Slow cooker
do not boil
So you don 't have to go to the doctor?
Just like that, he 'll get through without a doctor.
Chuck will be fine
damn i gotta go
rhubarb rhubarb
fool, that 's a code
put him in a wheelchair

What about the oxygen tube in your nose?
quick
sir
don 't bother you
do you mind if we take a picture with you
it means a lot to us
take pictures, he loves to take pictures
come give me the camera
- I 'll shoot - give you water
- Thank you very much
- thank you - no problem
OK push you over
turn around
everyone stand
Lol
eggplant





are you ready to sign?
how
Mesa Verde Bank ran away
- what- I persuaded him before
I thought I was convinced

what happened
They continue to work with Hamlin McGill Associates
Paige said they went over for a polite meeting this afternoon, anyway she thought Kevin had changed his mind.
- Was Howard persuaded? - No
Chuck




jimmy i have to ask
do you still want to do this

Did you say rent an office?
all of these
I think we might have to slow down and take it easy . . . think about it
etc
- Nothing has changed- Nothing has changed?
We 're about to sign a very expensive lease, but a lot of money is gone
That 's what a team is all about

This kind of thing happens all the time, you help me, I help you

There will be big clients like Mesa Verde

do you still want to continue











Yoshimai ...
I did exactly what you said and he didn 't get better
You did a great job Ernie
thanks

I 'll take over
He said he wanted me to stay
It 's okay, I 'm here
Next time you see Howard, tell him you 're going to get a big raise

Chuck Brothers

Hammer mill high-quality paper about 9 kg, 500 sheets and solid glue

*Still weird this week* *Undone meets people* *Mining information is like pulling teeth*
*One face, one number*
*and the pseudonym she uses*
*maybe this is pretty good*
*Then why don 't you do it*
*Then why don 't you do it*
*What 's the harm in having a lot of fun* *Whether you like it or not* *Never put on a bad face*
*Don 't know it 's your best result*
*Then why don 't you do it*
*Then why don 't you do it*
*Then why don 't you do it*
*Then why don 't you do it*

* rob a bank* * you may get nothing* * and then be brought to justice*
*Then why don 't you why don 't you why don 't you *
*why not do it*
*why not do it*





he got up
good afternoon
Is it afternoon?
What about Ernesto?
He should stay with me
Don 't blame Ernie
He spent the best part of the day admiring your Baked Potatoes [Tinfoil Wrapped]
I let him go home to sleep

are you hungry
Do you want anything but cookies?
no i 'm fine

When my stomach doesn 't hurt, I 'll make myself something to eat
Being outside for so long really hurts you
You have to do it, don 't you?
Can 't watch Kim poach Mesa Verde Bank
Gotta take it away from her
I didn 't take anything
we just keep the principal
You and Howard haven 't even heard of this bank that Kim brought it to you


I 'm going to take a shower and have a bunch of work to do
if you wanna fight jimmy
I 'm not in the mood to argue with you

Good rice

Thank you for staying with me
We have an unresolved grudge, but if we switch
I want you to know that I will treat you the same


great job
have you done this before
I haven 't done anything like that, but we learned grades in school
what score?
1/2 inch 1/8 inch 1/16 inch


You know what I have to admit I wasn 't as smart as you when I was your age
Maybe your teacher didn 't teach well enough
possible
can i drill
you promised
yes i promise
ok come here
Wear this when working with heavy tools
why don 't you wear
Because grandpa is an adult, he will become stupid when he grows up
ok put it on
OK
This is heavy so I 'll take it when I say press the trigger, will you press it?
put your hand up
all right?
Ready
ready to press

Well done

at home
we are behind


what is this doing
we 're making a special hose
The special hose, I see.
I made a mark every three quarters of an inch and grandpa put a piece of wood under it so it wouldn 't scratch the table
Then we drill holes at the marked number


I 'm going to make a drip irrigation pipe for the rhododendrons outside
Okay, grandpa 's gotta do the work himself, we gotta go
But we 're not done yet
it 's okay i 'll do it
Little princess, you have helped me a lot

I 've already made an appointment for lunch
- Pushed - Can 't push
can you stop touching me
do you think you 're playing the osteopath?
don 't get excited
walter you are no longer my husband nor my boss
I will never work for you again
If you 're content with being an editor and a reporter, things won 't be like this, but you won 't.
You ruined it all by marrying me
I 'm not satisfied, that 's the marriage I asked for.
It 's almost like two years in a row, you 're throwing love at me all day until I let go
'Ah Walter'
And I proposed to you when I was drunk that night
If you 're a gentleman you should forget about that night but you don 't
how dare you
Your eyesight is not as good as before
You used to throw more than this
hello yes what 's the matter sweeney
