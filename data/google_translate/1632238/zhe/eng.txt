 00 : 00 : 04, 491 -- > 00 : 00 : 07, 260 AMY : I must say , Penny , this is great fun . PENNY :
 Glad you 're enjoying yourself .
 Until I met you and Bernadette , my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination .
 AMY :
 Now they have a delightful social aspect .
 Amy , you must 've been in the bathroom with other women before .
 ( toilet flushes ) Of course I have .
 But they were strangers and seemed off- put when I engaged in friendly stall- to- stall chit- chat .
 Some women don 't like to get chummy when their panties are down .
 You okay in there , bestie ?
 PENNY :
 I 'm fine ...
 The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness ; the inability to pass uri ...
 PENNY : Yeah , I said I 'm fine . Stop talking to me .
 She always this crabby when she urinates ?
 We 're really not that close .
 Screw it .
 I 'll go later .
 And I 'll be right by your side .

 Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard ?
 Oh , that 's nice . No , it 's not .
 It 's a strategic maneuver .
 Leonard 's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette 's loyalty to you and the group .
 That bitch is crafty .
 - You think ?
 - Of course .
 How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests ?
 By going after its weakest member .
 Well , what makes me the weakest member ?
 Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny- tiny body . You wouldn 't last a minute on the Serengeti .
 Okay , Amy , you 're being silly .
 I 'm not concerned about who hangs out with who .
 And I certainly don 't have a problem with Leonard 's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup .
 Ooh , these are cute .
 Of course if I buy them ,
 I 'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple .
 It doesn 't matter .
 I 'm going to tell her we can 't make it .
 Oh , no . You to go .
 I don 't understand .
 I thought I was a teeny- tiny wildebeest .
 You are -- with hair that smells like strawberries .
 And we 're going to use that to our advantage .
 Wait . What are you talking about ?
 By accepting the invitation , Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp .
 She could ferret out Priya 's tactics , identify her weaknesses and feed her false information , such as :
 Leonard 's no stranger to back- alley cockfights .
 I don 't know .
 I 'm not a very good liar .
 They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school .
 Don 't worry . I 'll teach you .
 I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl .
 Okay , I don 't know you people .
 I 'm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card .
 How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom ?
 I don 't want anything in my ample bosom .
 Come on , Strawberries .
 Take one for the team . ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ...

 Original Air Date on May 5 , 2011 - Okay , see you later .

 - Good news . I finally have a handle on my idea for three- person chess .
 That is good news .
 Bye . Uh , do you know how I solved the balanced center combat- area problem ?
 Five words : transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation .
 That ... that 's brilliant .
 It 's what I do .
 But wait , there 's more . I also invented two new chess pieces .
 The serpent ... and the old woman .
 Okay , now I have to ask .
 What do they do ?
 When the serpent slithers to an opposing player 's piece , that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves .
 ( slight groan )
 All right .
 Unless ... it gets to the old woman in time , in which case she sucks out the poison , turning her into the Grand Empress :
 a piece combining the power of the knight , queen and serpent .
 Elegant .
 That 's because it 's simple .
 Okay , well , I look forward to playing with you .
 And ...
 And what ? And a third person .
 It 's three- person chess .
 I must say , ever since you started having regular intercourse , your mind has lost its keen edge .
 You should reflect on that .
 Excuse me , but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life .
 Yes , and he never unified gravity with the other forces .
 If he hadn 't been such a hound dog , we 'd all have time machines .
 Got it .
 Bye .
 You know I 'm right .
 I think he 's getting worse .
 Oh , my metatarsal are barking .

 - You okay ?
 - Yeah , yeah .
 I 'm just breaking in some new shoes .
 - Very pretty .
 - Thank you . Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent ?
 Hadn 't really thought about it .
 Look .
 Uh , sure .
 Very ... prominent .
 Please , Leonard , don 't leer , you have a girlfriend .

 - Sorry . - So , are you off to dinner with Priya , Howard and Bernadette ?


 Yeah . How did you know ?
 I heard it at the mall , when I was shopping with my girlfriends ,
 ' cause , you know , that 's kind of my life now .

 Have a good night . Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away .
 - Hey , you .
 - Hi .

 Hey , Raj , will you be joining us for dinner ?
 The lonely guy and the two happy couples ?
 I 'd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers .
 Oh , would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself ?
 I have to feel sorry for myself .
 I 'm the only one who cares .
 Just like I 'm the only one who 'll have sex with me .
 Really ?
 In front of your sister ?
 We shared a room growing up .
 This is not news to me .
 Excuse me .
 I 'm going to go wander the streets alone .
 Invisible , unwanted and unloved ; a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart .
 I forgot my windbreaker .
 It 's chilly .
 I don 't understand .
 Is this a way to break in new shoes ?
 No .
 Once these puppies touch the ground they 're mine , and I 'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off .
 ( cell phone chimes )
 Pretty , pretty , pretty . Good news : the wildebeest is in the curry .
 The what ?
 Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard .
 Message received . Commence operation " Priya Wouldn 't Wanna Be- ya . "

 Hey .
 Seriously ? Didn 't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school ?

 I wish .
 A clique requires friends .
 - I didn 't have any .
 - None ?
 I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor .
 It was nice until his wife called me a and made me stop .
 ( cell phone chimes ) Hang on .
 It 's the wildebeest . Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career .
 W- What the hell did she say ?
 She thinks it 's cool you 're following your dream , no matter what .
 That bitch !
 How do you want to handle it ?
 Um , okay .
 Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I 'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie .
 Got it .
 Is it going to be in 3- D ?
 What ? I don 't know .
 It doesn 't matter .
 I 'm gonna say 3- D.
 That 'll let her know the studio has faith in it .
 You 're kidding .
 3- D ?
 That 's what I hear .
 Then the studio must have real faith in it .
 Wonder why she didn 't me .
 Have you been spending time with your ex- girlfriend ?
 No ... Then why are you surprised she didn 't tell you ?
 Well , it 's not as much " surprised " as ( stammering ) you know ... uh ... the other thing .
 What other thing ?
 ( stammering ) Well , if you ... uh ...
 I don 't ... oh ...
 What 's the word I 'm looking for ?
 I 'm not going to help you . This is hilarious .

 She 's also dating an astronaut .
 Wow .
 That 's very impressive .
 Yeah .
 But Leonard 's impressive , too .
 Thank you .
 " Befuddled . "
 The word I was looking for was " befuddled . "
 Knight to old woman ... six- and- a- third .
 Brilliant move .
 Thank you .
 ( knocking on door )
 Will the two of you excuse me ?
 I need a hug .
 Sorry , I have company .
 Come on , Sheldon , open the door .
 I don 't want to hug you .
 I don 't want to hug you , either . I was just feeling blue .
 Blue , as in depressed .
 Well , not so much depressed as lonely .
 I don 't know what color lonely is .
 - What ?
 - Red is angry ; yellow is frightened ; green is jealous ; and blue is depressed .
 Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely .
 Nothing rhymes with orange .
 It 's probably lonely .

 All right . Come in .
 You look positively orange with loneliness .
 No , I don 't see that catching on at all .
 What are you doing ?
 I 'm working on my three- person chess game .
 Oh , cool .
 Can I play ?
 It 's three- person chess .
 Did you bring a friend ?
 No .
 Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can 't play three- person chess .
 Can you believe this guy ?
 Social protocol does , however , require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need .
 No , thank you .
 I 'm fine .
 It 's not optional .
 We 're out of tea .
 I hope you like bouillon .
 I , uh , I guess you 're probably wondering what 's got me down .
 Actually , I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece .
 How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey -- the king 's feeble- minded but well- meaning cousin ?
 I 'm going to be 30 years old , and I have no one in my life to love me .
 I 'm such a basket case , I can 't even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body .
 The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves , there 's a one- in- five chance he 'll kill himself .
 Sheldon , listen to me .
 I have a big decision to make , and I 'm scared .
 Yellow . Go ahead .
 A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they 're testing .
 He says it 's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder .
 Fascinating .
 What 's in it ? I 'm not sure .
 Some sort of beta- blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows .
 I like cows .
 That 's not the point .
 It was its own point .
 Go on . I 'm a scientist .
 My ability to think is my bread and butter .
 I 'm afraid if I take this , I might lose that special , unique something that makes me so successful in my field .
 Rajesh , I 've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years .
 My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs .
 Okay , I 'm still trying to work this out .
 How did Penny meet an astronaut ?
 I don 't know .
 The regular way people meet astronauts .
 Most of those guys live in Texas .
 Obviously , this one doesn 't .
 Okay .
 Leonard lives here . Priya 's from India .

 People meet , Howard .
 God !
 Fine .
 You 've met lots of astronauts , and I 've never grilled you about that .
 I 'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy .
 I 'm not grilling you ; I was just curious .
 I still can 't get over the fact that she got a big movie part .
 Not that I care what my ex- girlfriend 's up to , 'cause I don 't .
 Maybe that 's where she met the astronaut , all right ?
 What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie ?
 I 'm sorry .
 He 's a consultant .
 I thought the movie was about 18th- century Vienna .
 He can 't have a hobby ? !
 Excuse me , I have to pee .
 Or is that implausible , as well ? !
 It 's nice to have another couple to hang with , isn 't it ?
 All right , guys , you have to go back .
 I can 't afford you .
 ( high- pitched ) :
 No , don 't send us away ; we love you . ( normal voice ) :
 I love you , too , but you cost more than my rent . ( high- pitched ) :
 But , Penny , you look so good in us .
 Damn it , the shoes are right .
 Good golly , Penny , your whimsy is boundless .
 ( phone ringing )
 What do you got for me , wildebeest ?
 I think they 're on to me .
 The story 's starting to fall apart .
 Calm down . Everything 's going to be okay .
 We may have to kill her . Bernadette , I 'm putting you on speakerphone .

 Where are you now ?
 In the bathroom .
 Oh , look at this , another one of our classic bathroom gabfests .
 What 's the problem ?
 They 're just asking me all sorts of questions I can 't answer .
 Just change the subject .
 I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya 's parents .
 What ? !
 They said something about going there this summer .
 What , are they getting engaged ?
 I don 't know .
 I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy 's stupid astronaut story !
 What astronaut story ?
 You texted me Penny 's dating an astronaut .
 I texted " architect . " That 's amusing .
 Auto- correct must 've changed it .
 Yeah , it 's hysterical .
 All right , look , just forget about the astronaut .
 Architect .
 Where would you have met an astronaut ?
 Look , just find out what 's up with this trip to India .
 I don 't want to do this anymore ! Don 't you quit on us !
 ( knocking ) WOLOWlTZ : Bernie , you okay ?
 It was an architect !

 Thank you for coming with me , Sheldon .
 You 're a good friend . I 'm glad you think so .
 That 's what I strive to emulate . Okay , let 's see if this drug works .

 Can I help you ?
 Forgive me for staring , but you 're very beautiful .

 Thank you .
 That 's a great accent .
 Where are you from ?
 India . Oh , cool .
 I 've always wanted to go there .
 It 's a beautiful country .
 You 'd love it . May I join you ?
 Uh , okay , sure .
 Why not ?
 My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali , and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper .
 Hi .
 There 's no need to interact with me .
 I 'm just here to observe .
 What 's he observing ?
 We 're scientists . We observe everything .
 Here , go buy yourself a scone .
 All right .

 - And what is your name ? - Angela .
 Oh , derived from the word " angel . " Appropriate .
 You 're cute .
 I 'd like to buy a scone .
 Oh , I 'm sorry , we 're out .
 We have muffins . They sound delicious , but this money is earmarked for scones .

 ANGELA :
 What are you doing ? !
 Oh , just getting comfortable .
 So how long have you lived in Los Angeles ?
 I ...
 They were out of scones .
 Sheldon , I 'm talking to someone .
 You 're being rude .
 I 'll bet you 're an actress . If not , you should be .
 You have a very expressive face .
 Oh , my God . Wait , where are you going ?
 We were doing so well .
 She never even got to see my penis .
 Ta- da !

 Who wants some more coffee ?
 Thanks , yeah .
 Sure .
 Let me help you .
 Nice to see that the gals are getting along .
 " Gals " ?
 Who are you , Fred Flintstone ?
 This trip to India sounds fun .
 Yeah , I think it will be .
 Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard ?
 A little .
 They 're very old- fashioned . Well , I wouldn 't worry about it .
 It 's not like you guys are getting engaged , right ?
 ( chuckles )
 Oh , God , no .
 We 're not there yet .
 Not engaged .
 Very interesting .
 I have to tinkle .
 You 've been in there a lot tonight . Are you okay ? Yes .
 Are you writing a book ?
 Why are you getting upset ?
 I 'm not upset . Maybe you 're upset .
 What 's up with you ?

 Bernadette ?
 I can 't do this anymore !
 I 'm a good girl !
 I went to Catholic school ! Okay , well , it 's getting late .
 This was terrific .
 You win .
 Bernie ?
 I think the word you 're looking for is " befuddled . "

 My catapult flings my bishop to Howard 's Queen 's Gorilla two .
 Nice . Okay , rook to transporter pad .
 And he comes out at ... ... Leonard 's Queen 's Bishop five- and- a- third .
 Check on Leonard .
 Hang on .
 When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart ?
 When it 's done charging . Or you land on the time machine .
 Obviously .
 Oh , oh ... Beekeeper to King 12 .
 I capture your pope and release the swarm .
 Checkmate on Sheldon .
 I knew I should 've given my pope the jet pack .
 Hey , I 've got winners .
