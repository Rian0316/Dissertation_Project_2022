 00 : 00 : 00, 013 -- > 00 : 00 : 01, 697 The Big Bang Theory : Guess who I found at LAX . My baby sister Priya .
 It 's really nice to see you again , Leonard .
 Yeah , it 's good to see you , too .
 Here you go . Thanks .


 You slept with my sister ? !
 Yeah . This is a terrible betrayal of my trust !

 Would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart , and she kinda stomped on it ? !
 How hard did she stomp ?
 Very hard . Okay , I 'm good .


 ( giggles )
 What 's so funny ?
 Nothing .
 Just thinking about the noises people make during sex .
 I do sometimes get a bit carried away , don 't I ?
 ( chuckles ) It 's cute .
 You sound a little like a drunken monkey .
 Ooh- ooh- ooh- ooh !
 You know it 's meant as a compliment . That 's how I take it .
 ( sighs ) This is perfect .
 I hope this moment never ends .
 Me , too . ( both sigh )

 Well , gotta go .
 Oh !

 Already ?
 Why don 't you stay over ?
 I 'd love to , but you know my mother needs me in the morning .

 I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself . It 's not just the wig .
 It 's pinning her hair up , drawing on her eyebrows .
 It 's a two- person job .

 It 's just , when you leave right after we make love , it makes me feel ... cheap .
 Oh , honey , I 'm sorry .
 What can I do ? Stay .
 Okay .

 ( sighs )
 Like , what , another five , ten minutes ? Go home .
 Your call .

 Howard ... have you ever considered us living together ? Boy , I don 't know .
 You , me , Ma living under the same roof ?
 No , I mean just you and me .
 You can move in here , or we can find a place .
 I 've got a better solution . What ?
 We wait for my mom 's heart to explode from all the salt she eats .
 Then we just stick her in the ground , flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom . Great .
 Look at us planning a future together !

 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Who 's there ? !
 Are you a sex criminal ? !

 Sex criminals don 't have keys , Ma ! Where were you so late ? !
 I was out with Bernadette !
 I know what that means !
 I watch
 I hope to God you used a condom !
 I 'm not having this conversation with you , Ma !
 God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases ! Nobody has a disease !
 I hope not !
 I share a toilet with you !
 Is that what you want ? !
 To give your mother herbies ? !
 That 's it ! I don 't have to take this !
 Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning !

 Who 's there ? !
 Are you a sex criminal ? !
 I 'm still leaving !
 I just forgot my Claritin !

 Original Air Date on February 17 , 2011
 Hey , what 's up ?
 I need a place to crash . Uh , sure .
 Why ?
 Big fight with my mother .
 Still arguing over which is the best ?
 No , we agreed they all have their merits .
 This was about Bernadette .
 What 's going on ?
 Howard 's gonna sleep here tonight .
 He had a fight with his mother .
 Did you offer him a hot beverage ?

 No .
 Leonard , social protocol states when a friend is upset , you offer them a hot beverage , such as tea .
 Tea does sound nice .
 You heard the man , Leonard .
 ( snaps fingers )
 And while you 're at it , I 'm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest , so make me cocoa .

 Point of inquiry , given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend , why didn 't you seek refuge under his roof ?
 There 's no room . His sister is staying with him .
 Wait , wait .
 What ?
 Cocoa , Leonard . Focus .
 I 'm down in the dumps here .
 Priya 's in town ?
 Yeah , some work thing .
 Anyway , my mother seems to think that Bernadette ...
 Hold on . When did Priya get here ?
 I don 't know . A couple of days ago .
 The thing is , Bernadette doesn 't like that I have to take care of my mother , and my mother doesn 't trust Bernadette ...
 Yeah , that 's a real pickle .
 Bye . ( door closes )

 Don 't worry .
 As your tertiary friend , I am prepared to step in and comfort you . That 's not really necessary .
 No , no .
 I 'll finish making the tea , while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever 's troubling you .
 Thanks .
 That 's what tertiary friends are for .

 KOOTHRAPPALl :
 Who is it ?
 It 's Leonard .
 You can 't come in .
 I just want to talk to her .
 I forbid it . Open the door , Rajesh .
 You heard me .
 I forbidded it .
 " Forbidded " it ?
 " Forbaded " it ?
 Get out of the way .
 What are you doing here ? What are doing here ?
 I have business in Los Angeles .
 Why didn 't you call ?
 Clearly , she was sending you a message to take a hike , Mike .
 I 'm sorry .
 I thought about calling , ♪but I just wasn 't sure if seeing you was such a good idea .
 I know . Last time I came on too strong .
 Can we talk in private ? No !
 Sure .

 It 's completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private .
 If you insist on talking , you must do it on the couch !
 All right , you may talk in the bedroom , but I want this door to remain open !
 All right , just this once you may close the door .
 But keep in mind I 'll be right out here monitoring the situation !

 Oh , damn it .
 Leonard , when you get this message , call me .

 Priya , this is your brother . When you get this , tell Leonard to check his voicemail .
 Would you be sleeping over again this evening ?
 Because you 're welcome to .
 That 's very nice of you , but I made other plans .
 Well , just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend , I stand at the ready .
 Hi , Howard . Hi , Sheldon . Hello .
 Hey .
 Why are you holding hands ?
 I forbid you to hold hands .
 Rajesh , you know Leonard and I spent the night together .
 Yeah , but you were just sleeping , because I forboded you to have sex .
 The word is " forbade "
 You sure ? That doesn 't sound right .
 Listen , Rajesh , Leonard and I have decided to see each other again , and you don 't get to tell me who I can and can 't have a relationship with .
 Actually , he can .
 The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters .
 If a woman 's father is not around , the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family , in this case , Raj .
 The code also states that if she disobeys , she will be reborn
 " in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases . "
 If true , that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard .
 There it is , Priya .
 We 're Indian .
 We believe this stuff .
 I think it also says that if you eat beef , you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine .
 Some of it makes sense , some of it 's crazy .
 My point is , you can 't go out with Leonard .
 Who can 't go out with Leonard ? My sister .
 Penny , this is Raj 's sister , Priya .
 It 's very nice to meet you .
 Oh , yeah , you , too .
 Priya , if you 're experiencing any tension or awkwardness , it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to -- if I may quote Howard -- " do the dance with no pants . "


 Sheldon !
 Really ?
 Hey , Bernadette , can I talk to you for a second ?
 Sure .
 Penny , you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover .
 Would you please tell my sister why ?
 Listen , my mom 's going to Palm Springs to visit her sister .
 That 's two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning .
 Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses , in which case I 'll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier .
 That 's it ?
 That 's your big solution to all of our problems ? If your mom 's nose holds up , we get two nights together ?
 Isn 't that great ?
 No , it 's not great .
 You need to make a choice . Me or your mother .
 Uh ...
 Wrong answer .
 No , wait .
 You didn 't let me finish .
 I 'm listening .
 Uh ... ( groans )
 I came as quickly as I could . Okay .
 Why ?
 To comfort you , of course .
 Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh 's sister .
 So I high- tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart .
 Amy , I 'm fine .
 You don 't have to be strong for me .
 Now let 's talk about Priya , that man- stealing bitch .
 What ?
 In situations like this , best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman .
 ( yowls )
 Really , I am not upset about Leonard and Priya . Oh . Then perhaps you don 't understand what 's going on .
 Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate .
 Arguably much more suitable than you .
 Oh .
 Well , good for him . Hey , what do you mean , " more suitable " ?
 Well , granted , Penny , your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious .
 But Priya is highly educated , she 's an accomplished professional , and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex .
 Whereas you , on the other hand , are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows .
 Yeah . Okay , I got it .
 I got it .
 So ... what is all that stuff ?
 This is a portable electroencephalogram .
 I 'm doing research on emotions and brain activity .
 So when you start crying , I can see which region of the brain is activated .
 Then I 'm going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries .
 Cool , huh ?

 ( knocking at door )
 I choose you .
 Really ? Yep .
 I moved out of my mother 's house .
 Cord is cut .
 I 'm all yours .
 What did she say when you told her ?
 I don 't know . She hasn 't responded to my email yet .
 This is so great .
 I love you , Howard .
 I love you , too .
 So what 's for dinner ?

 Well , I don 't really have much of anything in the house .
 That 's fine .
 Why don 't we go fool around in our bedroom ?
 And then you can go shopping .

 I thought maybe after we eat , we could see an early movie . I 'd love that . I love the way you say ,
 " I 'd love that . "
 She says it the same way I do .
 " I 'd love that . "
 Everybody in India says it that way .
 It 's not a big deal .
 Rajesh , don 't be a child .
 I 'm not being a child .
 Leonard , I swear to God , if your sister ever comes to town ,
 I shall have my way with her . My sister 's 38 and married .
 All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter .

 Ooh , I thought I smelled pizza .
 That 's remarkable .
 If pepperoni were an explosive substance , you could replace German shepherds at our nation 's airports .
 Hi . Penny , right ?
 Oh , yes .
 H- Hi .
 I 'm sorry .
 I didn 't know you had company .
 I don 't want to impose .
 No , no . It 's not an imposition .
 At this point , in our ecosystem , you are akin to the plover , a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles .

 Please , fly into our open maw , and have at it .
 If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator ,
 I wouldn 't have to take that .
 Hi , bestie . Hi .
 So , um , Priya , you 're a lawyer , right ?
 I know . Pretty boring , huh ?
 Oh , come on .
 It 's not boring at all .
 She 's currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology .
 Hmm ? Thank you , Leonard .
 That doesn 't make it sound boring at all .
 ( Leonard chattering excitedly ) So , how you holding up ?
 I 'm fine .
 Oh , who are you kidding ? She 's breathtaking .

 So , Penny ,
 Leonard tells me you 're an actress . That must be pretty exciting .
 Oh , yeah , yeah . It 's real great .
 Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition
 I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial .
 Turned out to be porn .
 Did you get the part ?

 I didn 't do the audition .
 Given the state of your career , can you really afford to be picky ?

 I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge .
 I loved it . We did
 Oh , wow .
 I love Taming of the Shrew .
 I did a paper on it in high school .
 " Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ?
 In his tail . " " In his tongue " " Whose tongue ? "
 " Yours , if you talk of tails , and so farewell . "
 " What , with my tongue in your tail ? "
 ( both laughing )
 I 'm regretting my earlier cattiness .
 She is an absolute delight .

 Wow .

 Wow , indeed .
 I can 't believe we 're finally living together .
 Yeah . You know what would make this moment perfect ?
 What ?
 A little snack .
 You got any string cheese ?
 No .
 I- I might have some cheddar .
 Not as good .
 You can 't make strings with it .
 Remind me to put it on your shopping list .
 Okay . You have hypo- allergenic detergent ?
 No .
 Better put it on the list .
 If you wash my underwear with regular soap ,
 I get little red bumps on my
 Wait a second .
 I 'm doing your laundry ? Well , honey , it 's not gonna do itself .
 Oh , before I forget , tomorrow morning , you 're driving me to the dentist .
 I have to take you ?
 You don 't have to take me .
 You get to take me . Wait a minute .
 Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist ?
 It 's not weird .
 There 's lots of kids there with their moms .
 I can 't believe this .
 What ?
 It 's fun .
 If I have no cavities , afterwards , we go out for a treat .
 All right , Howard , let 's get something straight right now .
 I 'm not going to be your mother .
 Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Where did that come from ?


 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Who 's that ? !
 Is it a sex criminal ? !
 Nobody wants to do that to you , Ma !
 Where were you ? !
 Didn 't you read my email ? !
 You know I can 't turn on that computer !
 I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter !
 Thank you ! Remember to floss after .
 We have the dentist in the morning !
 Oh , hey .
 What 's up ?
 I just wanted to check in on you .
 Why ?
 It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one 's best friend finds herself replaced by a smart , beautiful woman with the smoldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger .

 I already told you , I 'm okay with it .
 I mean , if anything , I 'm quite pleased that Leonard has found someone ( sobbing ) : that makes him so happy .
 It 's okay , it 's okay .
 Thank you .
 Now , let 's get these electrodes attached and see what 's going on in that pretty little noggin of yours .
 Okay .

 ( knocking at door )
 I smell Chinese food . It 's actually Thai .
 You 're slipping .
 Are Leonard and Priya here ?
 They went to Catalina for the weekend .
 Oh . Where 's Raj ?
 At home , forbidding it .
 How about Howard ?
 I 'm given to understand his mother grounded him for running away .
 Oh , okay . Well , I guess it 's just the two of us , huh ?
 Actually , it 's the three of us .
 AMY ( on computer ) :
 What up , bestie ?
 Good news .
 Thanks to you , I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry
 like a disgraced televangelist .
 Great .
 So , you feeling better ?
 Not really .
 Sheldon , you have a guest who 's upset .
 Right . I 'll make tea .
 - Sweetie , it 's okay .
 I don 't want tea . It 's not optional . - I 'm sorry .
