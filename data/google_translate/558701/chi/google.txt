Some secrets have been discovered
After my mom died I started to remember what happened to Dana
Who is Dana? What are you doing here?
Some secrets are about to be revealed
It 's possible that one of these people had an affair with her
It 's okay, I 'll keep watching her
And some secrets
Jordana Geist does it all
What 's your secret? Shared
Is this an ADD drug?
Competitive
Meaning varies from person to person Competing in Suburbia means catching up with Joneses
And competing at Wisteria Lane means taking on Bree Van D e K amp
Everyone knows that Bree 's lawn is the most beautiful in this neighborhood
No one dares to challenge this position No one that means except Martha Huber
In comparison, her craftsmanship is much inferior, no matter how well-kept and watered she is
what a generous fertilization
The grass over the fence is greener than this

Hi Victor, how is your day?
Jogging again?
I can 't breathe
Do you need me to give you some water?

V i c t o r ?
V i c t o r ?
do not worry
The day I went to call an ambulance, Huber finally found a chance to turn the competition around

Help !
Can anyone help!

Oh what happened?
He passed out on your lawn
Hit 9 1 1!
Yes Huber knows how to compete and be careful if you want to win

Everything You Can Do Season 1 Episode 7
When I was alive my friends and I got together once a month this was S tere A lan 's book club
We find the questions of literary characters so fascinating, how they deal with adversity and how to deal with illicit relationships
endure conflict within the family
Planning a romantic pursuit
My friends lost interest in fiction after I died
What do you think?
Their own problems are enough trouble I find Madame B ovary very inspiring

Inspirational ?
She took arsenic and committed suicide
real ?
you haven 't read it yet?
I read 50 pages
Am I the only one who has finished reading this book ?
I watched the movie and it was great
sorry ladies but
What 's a book club for if we all don 't read?
More wine? Then oh R eba E mmaand L aurie ,
Can you guys help me in the kitchen?
of course can
I 'll be right over
God I can 't wait to send them away listen
Lynette said you found Zach in a rehab
Julie slipped in and talked to him
Did he say anything about his mother 's suicide?
Time was running out. He didn 't say anything mysterious. He said it had something to do with a guy named Dana.
Then there is no chance to say
Who the hell is Dana? That 's the most mysterious part I think Dana has to do with something Mary Alice is trying to hide
Someone discovered Mary Alice 's secret
Then send her this note
Who is that person?
Letter paper is 17 gauge faux parchment 100% cotton
It is produced by Cypress Office
They have stores in 12 cities including the city where you live
I took the postmark and asked the local post office
Then what? Then it turns out that the threat is likely to be a neighbor you know, a milkman,
Plumber, Caddy
Caddy ?
Mr. Young sometimes the evil will drive a pickup truck to me I have had this experience I once hunted down a mother of a child she desperately threw her daughter on the ground
on parade floats
FBI blocks half of guardians who come to school
Did you catch her? Mr. Young
My employer didn 't hire me to catch her wow darling
It looks flawless here
thanks
hey listen
I have an excellent idea for our new Smudge-Free Wipe
Great. Do you need me to help you?
no i can
Thank you
All right
But the problem is as long as I make my suggestion at the meeting
Hennessy always contradicts me in front of colleagues
Well I invited my colleagues and their wives so I could communicate with them at home I thought maybe we could have a formal dinner at six so we could sit together
When will this formal dinner be held?
uh the day after tomorrow
- Oh, I know I know
I know it 's too sudden I just
What do you think? How can I throw a formal dinner party without any preparation?
I didn 't know Bree V an D e K amp always did this
What did you just say?
wow sorry i didn 't mean that
I mean that 's it, I 'll call to cancel
don 't worry about it
no no we can do it
real ?
yes it 's good for your career i 'm still planning
oh dear thank you so much
you know what i owe you i promise
I 'll buy you some extremely beautiful things
Luckily for Tom Lynette has a recipe for success unfortunately
She forgot the recipe for the secret


- hello- it 's me
Don 't look back, my mother-in-law can see you
I hate that she keeps spying on us
See you at the motel in an hour?
J o h n ?
uh, i have an arrangement
do you want to cancel ?
i 'm going to the movies with Danielle
Sounds like going on a date
Yes
I 'm not used to seeing you with other girls
I 'm not used to seeing you have a husband
I think we all have to learn to adapt
Don 't even try to make up for me with some dirty words
Hey ?

Mr and Mrs V an D e K amp Yesterday your son wanted to please his friend
banging a freshman 's head on the cabinet
Is it the son of the Johnsons?
yes your son broke his nose
Your son is about to be expelled under the principle of severe punishment
Are you going to ruin his future for this little destructive act of his?
Rex, it 's called attacking Mrs. Stark, obviously what Andrew did was very bad.
But I have two words for him her mom and I are facing serious marital problems
What 's the deal with these two? Our marriage is falling apart
So Andrew 's behavior is a bit abnormal and he has reason to be angry
If A ndrew is angry because you moved out
Then maybe he should bang your head against the cabinet
I just think we need to take responsibility for this too
A ndrew is also responsible for blaming his actions on our problems
Besides, our problem is not serious and can 't help him
Our problem is serious
Mrs. Stark, come back to this issue when you think it 's appropriate
Bree I found a lawyer
You 'll get the divorce papers later today
Did you find a lawyer?
Yes
And he 's a great lawyer, he better be strong because if we 're both over
You don 't even want to have a penny in your name
take it all
Maybe we can detain him
Mom, you 're overdressed
i know i want to look sexy
I told Mike I want him to get you home by eleven o 'clock
Well, how about twelve o 'clock?
Well it can 't be too late you know what I 'm worried about
Do you have protection measures?
oh god
we can 't talk about this
Maybe because I like to be your only child
Are you finished?
I 'm always thinking I might give my first night before your second sex
ok you can go now
Yeah
What do you think? Too formal?
yes what do you want to say ?
It 's 80 degrees outside and you 're wearing wool

Hi Mike
hello E die
wow your fancy dress
It looks very nice
I almost didn 't recognize you
Oh this one? I have a date with Mike now

we had a kiss
for reference only
oh i love the coat great choice Susan really sorry i have to cancel the appointment
i have one
uninvited guest
connected
oh excuse me, my name is Kendra
I am Susan
I 'm going to pick up my luggage in the car
I know it looks misleading but there 's nothing between us
Kendra is just an old friend
old friend yes you know
Yeah, I know
No actually I don 't know old friend you mean the one who rescued you when you were drowning by your college classmate bowling buddy ?

it 's hard to explain
Can you make it clearer?
Mike I 'm going upstairs to take a shower
I promise to explain to you later
you look amazing
Where are Mike 's towels?
thanks
Hi!
How is your date ?
Mike needs to schedule another time because of the hot girl with the suitcase?
Oh that hit you too hard
for reference only
I want to move out of this place asap I will try my best
oh that 's fine
You do realize that you have to disclose the fact that your wife committed suicide in this room ?
Yes ?
oh yes the law sucks
People are still afraid of suicide
can 't blame them
I feel creepy standing here
Is there a way to keep it private?
Revised records? Yes you could say she shot in the living room
Then climb out and die
I 'm just saying that
oh i have to go i will call you tomorrow
E die and so on
Paul knows he can do anything to get a deal E die
But now he realizes she can do more than that
Hi Danielle
Hi Mrs Solis oh Danielle
Remember when you said you wanted to be a model?
Do you remember? Seems like I said it last summer
Yes, the summer training of the Percik modelling school has started
Would you like me to sponsor you?
me? oh my god this is one of the best modeling schools
Would you like to sponsor me? Of course I would
I really want to go to New York
Oh I 'd really like to help you get there too
Hi Jordana
Hi Lynette, how are you?
You look tired. Is everything okay?
I 'm actually preparing dinner for tomorrow night -- six people
Sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have any ADD meds the kids take to get me through?

T i n a !
don 't push your sister
Damn Lynette
I 'm not in good shape
i need energy
My sister E laine and her kids flew in to see me this week
Oh that 's great I wish my sister would come to see me often
Yeah, it 's nice to have a sister
Yes
It only takes three or four slices. I 'm really cornered.
Yes, not enough energy is really troublesome
Wish I could help you
I won 't forget Jordana about this
What do you mean? You mean when the kids get together
Don 't bring Tina because we 're not home
What 's up ?
You all know me and your mom have a bit of a bad day
After much deliberation we decided it would be better to get a divorce but no matter what the problem is with your dad
won 't change the fact that we love you
I have a question
ask, baby, you can ask
can i live with daddy
I mean mom, let 's face it, we 're driving each other crazy
Danielle would you prefer to live with your dad too?
I don 't mind who I live with as long as I have my own bathroom uh all that uh
This wine is giving me a headache
You found these after six weeks in the suburbs ?
There are more than 300 families in this place
It takes time to find them all
Dad said the last time he saw you you wanted to quit your job
yes i changed my mind
It 's a huge waste of your time and my dad 's money
Are you afraid that the old man will spend your inheritance early?
This joke is not funny
What 's the Mike question here?
There 's no way my dad could go check that ghost alone
If you quit he has to admit it 's over
let me pull my dad back
If I quit he 'll hire someone else
If you tell him there 's nothing to check here, he won 't
i can 't do that
What if your girlfriend finds out you 're not that sweet plumber neighbor?
you 're lying to her Mike
oh give you this
ok this one keeps the temperature of the crab meat
It 's too much work to shell these little things but it 's worth it
Are you shelling yourself?
I don 't want to talk too much but are you doing too much?
because you look so tired
I 'll be fine, just have some coffee
Thank you
oh my gosh look at this embroidery
Where did this come from?
Paul Young 's Sale
D a n a
Wow
Dana is a baby

yes it will go with you to the Percik modelling school
I pay the full fee
Are you serious? Can I really go to New York?
wait wait what modeling school
My new career Mrs. Solis funded
Oh now? When are you going to tell me?
What she just told me I think is a good idea
Do you two know what he 's doing?
He wants you to be on his side He wants to buy your love
Oh for god 's sake don 't be so extreme
Cars? Modeling school?
You should discuss these gifts with me first
Sorry kids but we can 't take this
Dad, you can 't let her do this
Bree We just told the kids we 're getting a divorce shouldn 't it be nicer to them?
I said no
do you know ?
They are my children too I give what I want
you go
- thank you dad- great!
You offered to sponsor Danielle to go to modeling school?
what ?
uh yes no uh

Then how does she know?
Gabrielle, did you fund her?
I just wanted to do a favor
So why on earth are you doing this in New York?
This is her dream Don 't you want to make her happy?
Do not
Speaking of dreams, I hope you keep your ridiculous idea to yourself
B r e e
J o h n
John ! You are jealous of Danielle so you want to get her to New York ?
I 'm not jealous just don 't like to share with others
You know what? I quit that garden and everything
oh don 't do that
What 's the point if we can 't be together?
sometime here, sometime there
I don 't want us to end up unhappy like this

Suburban Open House ?
This is too vulgar, you should restrain yourself
I 've never had a chance to enter this house on the street
God wish it didn 't happen
I 'll take you out for a drink tonight
There 's a cowboy bar called S addle R anch you need to check out
why ?
This is the last place someone saw your sister
Susan, why are you here?
I just wanted to say goodbye to Mary Alice 's house
before someone moved in
Oh
it sounds reasonable
what did you say? don 't do that
we all know why you 're here
You guessed it, they have an illicit relationship
absolutely true
You don 't know what you 're talking about they 're just friends, do you think so?
I overheard them saying they 're going to S addle Ranch tonight
drink and dance
So what about friends?
oh god i really wanna slap you to wake you up
You just said where are they going tonight?
I don 't know why I came here listening to you
Apparently they had nothing before
Where are you going? bathroom and go home
I don 't want Mike to see me here
It 's only been ten minutes
she may be waiting
Oh don 't end like this, you can 't beat her
this is not competition
the devil believe it
good evening E die
Whatever you want but I solemnly declare
I hope you can win him why are you on my side?
I think it 's easier to take Mike from you than from her
she looks funny
Eat some formic acid, it 's not that kind of pain
just a business banquet
Very important
ok ok
Let 's just go
G abrielle would be better off here
All right
See you in a few hours
take care of Carlos

I saw E die hiding behind
Are you kidding, she 's here too?
Yes
Yes she said 'the jig started' and she went to ride the bull
Oh she said you two came together
Oh yes
uh i just thought she was gone
Are you following me? What?
no i just came here with E die
we just love riding that bull
you ride a bull
yes yes so exciting
Forget it, Susan, let me rest, please let me rest
I didn 't follow you even though I did
That 's also because you 're too secretive about Kendra
Kendra and I are just friends
I 'm here to ride a bull
Oh !
We have another bull riding!

Oh no
i just say
Oh woo!
ok i 'll ride the bull

A ndrew you promised me to live with your mother
That 's why I gave you the car
Daddy she chased me away she threw all my stuff on the lawn
ridiculous
I 'll call her to settle this
go home
no dad why?
Now I can live with you without guilt
would be great like two bachelors living together
what? son it can 't be
Why? A ndrew
These months have been very difficult for me
I have to do a lot by myself
I can 't handle it if you live with me
I 'm sorry I don 't care okay?
I 'm not going back there
I don 't think you have a choice
but dad
uh-huh
Oh

Heath ? yes it 's me
Do you still have your fake ID?
Yeah I got my mom 's cold ass when I got home I think I 'll feel better when I 'm drunk
I know that 's enough
he was shocked
'It 's a movement, MPs, it 's not an election but you 've already voted,' he said.
That 's it
i like that
oh dessert looks amazing
Lynette do you need help?
I can, no problem, good Scavo
let 's hear what your genius thinks ok
uh ok the biggest problem with smudgeless wipes is the lack of visibility
we need to put ads where women go
such as large chain stores
Pictures of Smudge-Free Wipe Ads in Every Mom 's Cart

Interesting, do you know how it could be better?
dry cleaning bag
what? listen to me
Put a large smudge-free wipe between a woman and her cardigan
I promise you guys can get her attention baby baby it 's awesome
I 'm halfway through, oh I 'm on point with her
I should pay attention to this
These clean bags will hang in our closets forever
It 's like constant advertising
exactly
You know we might be able to do that but listen to me first
Did you know Lynette this is a brilliant idea
Can we do this nationwide?
Why not start at the very top of the funnel
and then distribute
B oomboomboom . . . Concentrated penetration oh do you know how to do it better? Like this
When Lynette is getting everyone 's attention
Susan is trying to avoid people 's eyes
Is everyone looking at me?
Just some vulgar watchers
Oh god why didn 't I just get knocked out?
Want a beer ?
of course yes
oh oh oh

ah ah ah
Susan this is Kendra
you have introduced
No this is Kendra we have been friends for years
She just came to see me and I 'm leaving tomorrow
it is true
I have no plans for this man anyway
be right back
Sorry to misunderstand me, how long have you been together?
you ruined our first date
Before this, we just looked at each other
That sounds miserable, I know
No, I think it 's better to slow down
Is there a particular reason you 're being smart about it?
Mike is a great man really
But you should W isteria Lane
There 's a reason
I brought some ice cubes
for you
thanks

very interesting thank you
goodbye
Oh

That guy driving fast just hit her
Do you have a cell phone ?

hit 9 1 1
When Juanita was on the brink of life and death
Lynette and Tom are arguing
I just got involved
Your participation is limited to making dinner
instead of criticizing my idea
Oh maybe you need a better idea
sorry sorry i didn 't mean that
no no we all know you had a better career than me before you had kids

You never let me forget that it 's not fair you always compete with me
Take tonight for example, you 're still competing
T om I 'm really sorry tonight
But these days if I 'm competing with someone else it 's just Bree V an D e K amps
Her perfect kitchen obedient child throws a party and everything is in order
I 'd love to catch up with her but I can 't Lynette it 's not what I expected
when you bring your colleagues
I remembered the world that I left behind
where i 'm a winner people always try to catch me
I can 't go back I can 't win now
I 'm stuck in the middle and it really hurts me
Cough, cough, cough, you said that
I think the dinner you prepared today is amazing
I 'm so shocked I don 't know how you ripped it all together
Oh
whether you believe it or not
Everyone who knows you thinks you are an excellent wife and mother
no no
Yes
especially me
thanks

nothing i 'm tired
turn around and wait i want to see you
I 'm fine really
Whoa, what 's going on outside?

But whether friendly competition
or life and death duel cheers the result is always the same
there are winners
there are losers

But the trick is to know what kind of competition to enter.
Victory comes at a price
