In the spring of 1891 when I returned from a brief sabbatical when I returned to Baker Street
Back to Baker Street fromashortholidayinth espringof 1 8 9 1 ,
I have only seen Sherlock Holmes a few times. I hadseenlittleof Holmesforsometime.
I learned from the newspaper that he was employed by the French government I sawinthepapersthattheh adbeenengaged to undertake a very important case bytheFrenchgovernmentuponamatterofsupremeimporta nce
But beyond what I expected, but I couldhardlyforeseetha titwouldhave this would have such dire consequences soviolentaconsequence. Now I must tell I tlieswithmenowtotellf orthefirsttime
In that fateful year happened whattookplacebetween Mr. r.
S herlock H olmes between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty and Professor M oriarity in thatfateful year .

Ah, Mrs. Hudson, is Mr. Holmes back?
A h ,   M r s .   H u d s o n   h a s   M r .

Just after his visitor left justafterhisvisitorle ft.

They also quarreled a few times about Theyhadwords . I didn 't like the look of the man. I didn 't like the lookofhim , notatall I didn 't .
H ehadafacelike , like thewrathof God
Worse than the wrath of the devil orshould I saythedevil.

To celebrate the return of Mr. Holmes? tocelebrate Mr. Holmes ' return? Why not?
W h y   n o t ?
Very good Verygood .
Thank you Mrs Hudson Thankyou , Mrs. Hudson .
I later learned that Mr. Sherlock Holmes had escaped three attempts on his life that very day from a premeditated attempt to kill him that day.
But while I waited for him to come home Butas I waitedforhimtoreappea r
In my eyes, Baker Street is as peaceful and quiet as ever.


Sherlock Holmes, you . . .
H o l m e s   y o u . . .
Wait, wait, wait, wait.


What is this Whatisit?
The air gun is actually a very special air gun Airguns , aratherspecialairguni nfact .

Can Watson give me a match?
W a t s o n ,   m i g h t   I   h a v e   a   m a t c h ?

Holmes, you 're hurt. Holmes, you  ' rehurt. Scratches, nothing, nothing to signify.


You don 't look good Sherlock Holmes Youdon  ' tlookwell H olmes .
I 've been a little bit nervous lately. I havebeensomewhatpress edbutlate. What 's wrong? Howpressed?
Since I can 't leave this room before darkW ellas I amunabletoleavethisro omuntilafterdark

Do you remember when I left Baker Street at the beginning of the year Youwillrecallthatitwas acoldmorningearlyinth eyear It was a cold morning when I lastleft Baker Street
I had no idea where I was and who my client was. I hadnoideawhere I wasgoingorwhomyclient was .
All I know is it 's very important A ll I knewwasthatitwasimpor tant
And it happened abroad andbroad . My destination is the Louvre and the museum in Paris, M ydestinationwasthemus eumandthe Louvewasin Paris

I finally kind of understand the reason for this caution Yes , now I begin to understand the elicacy of thematter .
The Louvre is closed every Monday for maintenance.
The Mona Lisa is not hanging in its place
