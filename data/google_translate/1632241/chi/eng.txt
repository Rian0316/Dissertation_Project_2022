 00 : 00 : 01, 460 -- > 00 : 00 : 04, 028 I 'm telling you , if xenon emits ultraviolet light , then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong .
 Yes , well , if we lived in a world where slow- moving xenon produced light , then you 'd be correct .
 Also , pigs would fly , my derriere would produce cotton candy , and would be a timeless classic .
 Oh , you 're so arrogant .
 If you were a superhero , your name would be Captain Arrogant .
 And you know what your superpower would be ?
 Arrogance .
 You 're wrong again .
 If my superpower were arrogance , my name would be Dr. Arroganto .
 I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together .
 Yeah , it 's like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice .
 Has it occurred to you you 're missing the big picture ?
 If you look at neutron scattering data ...
 Oh , Penny ? Penny ? What 's up ?
 Nothing . I just wanted to make Raj stop talking .
 No , no , no . He won . Suck it up .
 Well , I 'd ask you guys if you want dessert , but I know Sheldon doesn 't eat dessert on Tuesdays .
 And even if Raj wanted something , he couldn 't tell me .
 Howard won 't order anything , but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake .
 And Leonard 's lactose intolerant , so he can 't eat anything here without his intestines blowing up
 like a balloon animal .
 Hang on a second . I could have the fruit platter .
 You want the fruit platter ?
 Does it have melon on it ?
 Yeah . No , I can 't eat melon .
 Oh , Howard , heads up . Your ex- girlfriend just came in for her shift .
 When was the last time you saw her ?
 Oh , not since we broke up . Wow .
 How am I going to play this ?
 Sophisticated and relaxed ?
 Friendly , noncommittal ? Cold and distant ?
 Hi , guys . Hey .

 Original Air Date on October 14 , 2010
 So , my dear , we meet again .
 Hello , Howard .
 I 've missed you .
 I 've missed you , Katee Sackhoff .
 One question .
 Anything .
 Why am I wearing my flight suit in bed ?
 Why are in bed with
 If we start to question this , it all falls apart .
 Sorry .
 Oh , ravish me , Howard .
 My loins ache for you .
 Okay , if you insist . Howard , have you seen my girdle ? ! MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 No , Ma !
 I can 't find it , and I 'm late for my Weight Watchers meeting !
 Maybe it committed suicide ! Leave me alone ! Now , where were we ?
 I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth .
 Bernadette ? !
 What are you doing here ?
 Well , if I had to guess , I 'd say I 'm here because you saw me earlier this evening , and you 're still hung up on me .
 No , I 'm not .
 Clearly you are .
 Otherwise , based on past experience , we 'd be done by now .
 Okay , I 'm a little confused here . GEORGE TAKEl : Oh , my .
 Can I help ?
 Not that kind of confused . What 's George Takei doing here ?
 Howard , do you have latent homosexual tendencies ?
 No , of course not .
 So you say .
 Yet , here I am .

 George , let me ask you something .
 How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon ? It 's difficult .
 You try and stretch as an actor -- do Strindberg , O 'Neill , but all they want is , " Course laid in , Captain . "
 Tell me about it .
 It 's frackin ' frustrating . Wait .
 Katee , why are you leaving ? She 's leaving because you really want to be with me .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Howard , I found my girdle ! It was in the dryer ! Great , Ma !
 I think it shrunk !
 I 'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here !
 And with that mental picture , I think we 're done for the evening .
 You know , you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette . I did a stupid thing .
 Yeah , I guessed that .
 It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now .
 That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy .
 Oh , my God .
 You ran over a hobo . No .
 Stop asking . All right , fine .
 So you want to get back together with her , but you 're too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did .
 In a nutshell .
 Okay .
 Well , how about this ?
 Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn 't know it 's you .
 Now , you see , I don 't know if you 're kidding or not . You 're being unreasonable .
 Why can 't I have a desk ? !
 Our collaboration is a work of the mind .
 We don 't need desks .
 You have a desk . Correct .
 But I can 't have one .
 You 're two for two .
 Why can 't he have a desk , Sheldon ?
 Oh , Lord , will this day never end ?
 As I 've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali , whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it 's convenient , there 's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture .
 Oh , but there 's money for a drawer full of Red Vines , a marshmallow shooting rifle , and a super executive ant farm with glow- in- the- dark sand ?
 Yes . Okay , what if he buys his own desk ?
 Yeah , what if I buy my own desk ?
 That 's ridiculous . Why ?
 Because ...
 Yes ?
 It 's my office .
 Sheldon .
 All right , all right . He can buy his own desk .
 And I can put it in your office ?
 Well , you really want to dot the I 's and cross the T 's , don 't you ?
 Why would you want a glow- in- the- dark ant farm ?
 They do some of their best work at night .
 Ah , it 's okay .

 Penny ?
 Penny ?
 Penny ?

 Penny ?

 Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me ?
 Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it . I just have a question .
 Does Bernadette ever talk about me ?
 Oh , absolutely .
 She does ? Yeah , sure . Just yesterday , she asked ,
 " Why is Howard hiding under the table ? "
 She saw that , huh ?
 Oh , no , not at first .
 Right after I pointed it out .
 Let me ask you something else .
 Is she seeing anybody ?
 Oh , not that I know of .
 Hey , while we 're on the subject , why did you guys break up anyway ?
 Oh , I 'd rather not say .
 Howard , if you want my help , I 've got to know what happened .
 But it 's embarrassing ...
 Yeah , that 's what I 'm counting on . Spill . Okay .
 Well , you know Um , the online game ?
 Sure .
 Well , did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other ? Oh , God .
 I think I see where this is going .
 Her name was Glissinda the Troll .
 Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber- nasty under the Bridge of Souls .
 Oh , you 're right .
 That is so embarrassing . Would you talk to her ?
 Bernadette or the troll ?
 Bernadette .
 She was so mad at me , she wouldn 't even listen to my side of the story .
 Well , what was your side ? Well , for all we know ,
 Glissinda the Troll wasn 't even a real woman .
 I mean , she could 've been a 50- year- old truck driver in New Jersey . Really ?
 And that didn 't make her feel better ?
 Will you talk to her , see if there 's any chance at all we could get back together ?
 Oh , gee , Howard , I really don 't want to get in the middle of this . No . Why would you ?
 I 'm just another lonely nerd , living with his mother , trying to find any scrap of happiness he can .
 You know , maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11 . Okay , I will think about it .
 You know , I 've always blamed myself for him leaving .
 I always thought it was because I wasn 't the son he wanted . Yeah , I said I 'd think about it .
 I wasn 't athletic , yeah , I was kind of sickly ...
 Okay , fine .
 Look , look , I 'm calling her now ! See ? !
 Thank you .

 So anyway , Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette , and she did , and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee .
 One question .
 Yeah ?
 Why on earth are you telling me all this ? I don 't know .
 Sometimes your movements are so lifelike ,
 I forget you 're not a real boy .
 You said I could buy a desk .
 This isn 't a This is a ...
 Brobdingnagian monstrosity .
 Is that the American idiom for " giant , big- ass desk " ?
 It 's actually British .
 Can you say it again for me ? Brobdingnagian .
 One more time ?
 Brobdingnagian .
 Now three times fast ?
 Brobdingnagian , Brobdingna ...

 How did you even get it in here ?
 That 's for me , Ramon , Julio , Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out .
 All right , you 've made your point .
 A fine prank , very amusing .
 Now get it out . No .
 Yes . Yes .
 No .
 Yes !
 I have three brothers and two sisters , Sheldon -- I can do this all day .
 All right , if you 're not going to remove it ,
 I 'll remove it for you . Knock yourself out .

 Help me move my desk .
 No .
 Yes .
 No .
 Yes . No .
 It 's too Brobdingnagian .
 Why do you even want this here ?
 Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose .
 Well , seeing as its purpose was to piss you off ,
 I 'd say it 's spot- on .
 All right , I see what 's going on .
 This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit- for- tat exchanges .
 Well titted .
 Thank you . Stand by for my upcoming tat .
 Hey , Sheldon ? Yes ? No .
 See what I did there ?
 I turned it around .

 Sorry ,
 I had to clock out .
 Oh , no , that 's okay .
 How have you been ?
 Okay .
 You know , busy , schoolwork . I took a scuba- diving course over the summer , but it turns out I 'm terrified of the ocean . You ?
 Same .

 Too bad .
 You wouldn 't know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit , boy 's large ?
 Yeah , forget it .
 Not important .
 So , are you seeing anyone ? Well , to be honest , I ...
 Hey , how are we doing over here ? Can I get you something to drink ?
 Not for me , thanks .
 I 'm okay . Are you gonna want to order food ?
 Maybe later . Okay .
 So , are you seeing anybody ?
 No .
 That 's what I told him when he asked me .
 I hope that 's not out of line . No , it 's fine .
 Penny , can we have a little privacy ? Oh .
 I 'm sorry .
 What about you , have you been seeing anybody ?
 Well , you know how it is with guys . I mean , we have needs and ...
 So you 've been seeing other girls ?
 Well , not real girls .
 Does that mean slutty trolls ?
 You know , you look thirsty . I brought you some iced tea .
 Thank you .
 It 's passion fruit , new on the menu . I know . I work here .
 Oh , sorry . Yeah , you 're right .
 Doy . So , Howard , yay or nay ?
 Isn 't there somewhere else you can be ? Not where I can hear you guys .

 Okay , fine .
 I 'll admit , there are dark , sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones .
 The only reason I go there , the only reason I 've ever gone there is because I don 't have a real woman in my life .
 You happy ? Yeah , that 'll hold me for a while .
 Howard , you did have a real woman .
 I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll 's brains out .
 Yeah , but we weren 't ...
 I- I mean , you and I never ... Had sex ?
 Yeah . Well , whose fault was that ?
 Complimentary nachos !
 You enjoy .
 Never had sex ? Wow .
 What do you mean , whose fault was that ?
 Well , we could 've been having sex , but you never made the move .
 I didn 't think you wanted me to make the move .
 Howard , a girl doesn 't go out with a man like you , with your looks , your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she 's not expecting him to eventually make the move .
 Really ? Really .
 Son of a bitch .
 Hey , this is a little awkward , but my manager says
 I can 't actually give nachos away . So ... just take that when you 're ready .
 Yeah , we had a really great talk , and we 're gonna start seeing each other again .
 Oh , congratulations .
 Have you broken it to the troll yet ?
 Did Penny tell you about that ? No . Steve Patterson told me .
 The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management ?
 Yeah . How 'd he know about it ?
 He 's Glissinda the troll .
 Sorry , dude , the thermostat 's on my side of the room , so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music !
 I 'll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella- ridden parakeet !
 Oh , too bad ! Sheldon 's pathologically afraid of birds !
 Hey , look , Sheldon !
 Birdie , birdie , birdie ! That 's it !
 Prepare for marshmallow death ! Eat flaming Nerf !


 So anyway ...
 That 's great news about you and Bernadette . Yeah .
 I think I 'm gonna take her to miniature golf . Ah .
 Well , I guess for you guys that 's like regular golf .
 Short jokes ? Really ?
 You 're , like , a quarter of an inch taller than me .
 Yeah , and don 't you forget it .
 I had a good time .
 Me , too .
 Kiss her good night .

 All right , now a little tongue .
 GEORGE TAKEl :
 Hold on there .
 We 've only just rekindled the romance .
 Let 's not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva .
 Don 't listen to him .
 She wants it .
 Tongue . La , la , la , la , la .

 See ?
 Now make the move . Mm- mmm .
 Too soon .
 Trust me , she 's ready .
 Make the move .
 No , no , no .
 A lady wants to be wooed , courted slowly .
 How would know ?
 I read .
 Listen to me , Howard , it 's time .
 Make the move , now . Mm !
 What are you doing ?
 You said ... well , the " move , " remember ?
 Oh , not We 're starting a new relationship . I need to get to know you again .
 No , you don 't .
 It 's
 The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants .
 Be patient ; we 'll get there .

 Told you .

 Oh , God , what 's that smell ?
 Oh- ho- hoo !
 Yes ?
 What are you doing in there ?
 I 'm making hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gas .
 Just a little experiment in pest control .
 It 's not gonna work , dude ; I grew up in India -- an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street , and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement .
 Well , we 'll just see how long you can hold out .
 Well , we 'll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon - apple- scented aroma therapy candles .
 Didn 't you say you 're making hydrogen sulfide gas ? Yes .
 Isn 't that flammable ? Highly .
 Oh , dear .


 This is not over .
