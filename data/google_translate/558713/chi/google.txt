0 0 : 0 0 : 0 2 , 0 4 2 - -&gt; 0 0 : 0 0 : 0 2 , 9 1 8 Grandma is here (in life) . . . this is a postnuptial agreement
i won 't sign
- Ah! - Sign!
Stop! You hurt me!
Mrs Solis, why are you here?
(You can 't turn back time)
If you don 't know, you have to do it yourself
The clue is still related to D ierdre
I 'm not going to put money in the coffin
I 'll use it to help you clean up the mess
(It can 't make a person back to the way they were before)
A ndrew just told me he might be gay
( every morning )
(When Lynette Scavo picks up the trash)
(She 'll indulge herself in some daydreaming)
(It repeats bit by bit in my dream every day)
( one day her annoying neighbor K aren M c C luskey )
(will suddenly fall to the ground and die)
(Then a lovely Swede will buy her house)
(Lives in with two adorable twin girls)
(From then on, the friendship between the two families will last forever)
(And the happiest moment was when two little girls married her son)
(The wedding is very grand)
(And the Scavo family doesn 't have to pay a penny)
(Yes, Lynette enjoys little daydreams very much)
(But, McCluskey always has a way)
(bring her back to real life)
Hey Hey
Why did you steal my trash can?
The garbage truck came two days ago
The litter box hasn 't been moved since
I thought you didn 't want it
oh you are so cute
fine, give them to me
Too bad we had to see those horrible colors
you painted the house
We don 't have to look from your trash can
E itqutte , you want to talk about what makes a good neighbor ?
Why don 't you go get a gardener first
To deal with that mess you call lawn?
I have limited fixed income
oh maybe you should consider
move to a cheaper place
such as nursing homes
- Damn it - How 's the Germans doing, eh?
you know -
oh oh
Mrs. McCluskey--
Mrs. McCluskey, are you all right?
I 'll open the door
mrs m c luskey
(At that moment, Lynette is facing)
(an interesting option)
(She knows she will hate herself every morning from now on)
(Lynette made the right decision)
Lynette, where are they taking me?
You 're going to the hospital, Mrs. McCluskey.
you will be fine
I don 't want to go to the hospital alone, come and join me
oh they are well trained
And I still have in my fridge . . . barbecue
please, i 'm afraid
ok, i 'll go with you
- ok, i 'm up - thanks
If I 'm going to die, I don 't want to be with strangers
you will not die
How can you be so sure?
(Of course, Lynette didn 't give her an answer)
(how could she tell her neighbors)
( Some too good dreams can 't come true? )

(A journey where it 's best to have someone by your side)
(But sometimes we lose our partner along the way)
(From now on, there are only miserable winds and rains left in the journey)
N o a h
I never knew you were religious
What happened to the rose garden?
They found D ierdre
what ?
Her body was stuffed into a toy box
Can you believe it ?
A child 's toy box
she was dismembered
Oh my God
The police recognized her through a dental match
She 's been dead for 15 years
I 've been looking for her
And she 's gone
I am very sad
I can only bury my child
I 'm here, um. . .
I want to know what kind of tombstone to give her
Now you don 't have to do it
you should go home
i want to talk to one of the cops
Policemen ?
let him investigate your neighbor 's death
He 'll give you the file on the Dierdre case
They seem to have some clues
I have no idea
I think we might be doing it wrong
We 've made a decision, we 've got to abide by it
Ours is we 'll keep him here for another three weeks
What 's the worst case scenario?
Our son said he might be gay
And there are more than 200 boys in the camp
Now, I can tell you what would happen if we left him
But I 'm a lady
So I don 't say those words
You know, I bet our worries are superfluous
It 's probably just talk
That 's right, so we 're going to take him home
We 're taking him to a Christian counseling office
It 's not going to be forever
whatever he did
He is our son and we love him
Why are you telling me this?
Because apparently he 's gay
drive you crazy
I may be crazy
But that didn 't change my love for him
I said we need to calm down
I can be as calm as you
very good
I 'm glad you 're back
A ndrew . . . even if you were a murderer, I still love you
Mom, the line isn 't leaving
Oh, for St. Peter 's sake
mother
What? The kids are lining up
Oh dear, Hector teaches dancing here
in the community center
I also take private classes
oh, i think so too
Mom, what?
Could you please not flirt with the ice cream seller?
why not ?
Except he 's an ice cream seller
Do you need any more reason?
I call this: life goes on
You just broke up with Morty two weeks ago
can you pretend
Mourning your relationship?
Oh, you like to dwell on the past too much
You should come out and enjoy life
I know what we have to do tonight
we can find a club and pick some handsome guys
- Mom- oh, that 's great
I would say I 'm only 4 2 and you 're 2 8
What 's up ?
oh yes
Mrs. McCluskey, have you come back from the hospital?
It 's just a little bit more overdraft on the medicine
One pill, I have the strength to open the jar
And four pills would kill me
you 'll know soon
I 'm glad you 're all right
this
my way of thanking
Thank you for not letting me die on the lawn
Oh, Mrs. McCluskey, you don 't have to--
Take it, this is the real Tiffany
It 's been in my house for years
I don 't know what to say
This - - this is amazing thank you
I 'd love to invite you into the house, but--
oh i just wanted to tell you what the doctor said to me
Looks like the least of my problems is arthritis
Look, I have a skin disease--
I thought it was just a skin disease
The result could be more serious
Do you know what you are doing?
please-- i can 't sleep in that kennel anymore
i want bed
Well, you can go to a hotel
Because you won 't be coming back
How many times do you want me to say sorry?
Obviously, not enough
i don 't like what i do
I admit, I 'm too much
do you want to go to bed ?
you know how
I 'm not going to tear up that postnuptial agreement.
why not ?
Because only then can I be sure
You were here when I left prison
Well, I wish you a happy stay in the hotel
great
I 'll cancel all your credit cards tomorrow
what ?
I will also cancel all your bank cards
So how do I use the money?
Maybe when you know how comfortable you are here
you 'll treat me with respect
You want my respect? Then tear up the postnuptial agreement
give me the pillow
And there 's--
If you hurt me again, I 'll kill you
If you dare to get out of the wall
i will kill you too
Baby you are so passionate
Do we regret not having sex?
I feel like I 'm dying
Do you want me to open the window?
No, I 'm talking about my life
Oh, you don 't want me to continue?
no, no, continue
So how?
My marriage to Carlos
very unhappy
I feel like I have nowhere to go
This is driving me crazy
my life is messing up
In the past I always had second hand preparations
But now I feel like I have nothing
How about me? Can I do your second-hand preparation?
Damn, John, what are our new rules?
Don 't pretend we have a future
thanks
You can 't go out and live?
No, if I leave, I 'm done
If I stay, life will be a mess
And then he has it all, and that 's terrifying
He cancelled all my credit cards
I married him, but I have no money to shop
That 's the scariest thing in the world
I am sorry
I suddenly found
I am not interested today
I 'm leaving
Wait a moment
what is this ?
you should have good stuff
If Mr. Solis can 't give you this, I will
With your student credit card ?
I have my own job
- You mow the lawn - I make a lot of money
You know, I have twenty families, and I 'm just a little bit short
can work in a country club
i can 't take your card
no you can
I will give it back to you
If you insist, but you really don 't have to
Mrs. Solis . . . can take care of you . . .
is my dream
Well, I never would
Get in the way of a man 's dreams
hmmm
to the supermarket
I 'm going to buy dry cleaner
hmm i don 't know
Porter is going to the dentist at 4pm
So the car has to wait until tomorrow
ok i love you too, bye
hi ok i brought you black pears
I picked it from a tree in the backyard, but I don 't like it
but your family seems to like it
That can be made into dessert
Thank you so much, Mrs. McCluskey
let 's get started
Oh, well, I 'm afraid not now
I 'm getting ready to go out, I have a bunch of things to do
Oh that 's great, my car is still being repaired
I can take a way
I 'm going to the pharmacy anyway
no, i can 't, sorry
But I - I still have a lot to do
Maybe you can drop me off later, I can go to the pharmacy tomorrow
Mrs. McCluskey, I don 't have time all day tomorrow
Oh. Interesting, you didn 't even give me two minutes
But you took my lamp righteously
oh, for god 's sake, look
you should take this back
I - I don 't have a place to put it
But that 's how I thank you for saving my life
I know, and it 's pretty
Yes, but I just--
Save it, Lynette, I know it all
Oh my God
Susie , this is Tim
sorry we scared you
Oh, um, it 's alright, I--
I thought you were asleep
It 's quarter past twelve
Oh Susie, you should come tonight
I met Tim at the island bar
He introduced me to a crazy wine--
dirty volcano
Oh
Then we danced
He also soaked me
Sophie is so soft
umm, can i talk to you
speak alone?
Oh of course
Susan is your daughter ?
Yes
no, it 's not possible
no she is
no she is
Well, I get it, she looks young
Oh
The man has magic fingers
What the hell are you doing? I have a teenage daughter at home
You can 't just take the strange man you met in the bar
Take it home in the middle of the night
we just had some fun
What 's the big deal ?
I know you 're trying to forget Morty
but you shouldn 't
can you go out
Let that man go home?
You know how gloomy I used to be
Why can 't you support me a little?
I have enough support
no, you didn 't, you didn 't at all
Now Tim is my guest
I let him go home and he came home
If he doesn 't disappear within five minutes
I 'll go tell him
your real age
Tim , I 'm tired, it 's time to say goodbye
D e l f i n o
Um
You must be Sullivan
Profile of N oah 's daughter
Yeah, he said you got a clue
Yes, of course, we found some clues
Is there a problem ?
hey i don 't know
I 'm putting an encrypted police file
to a murderer and drug dealer
Are you saying there is a problem?
thanks
Is our judicial system like this?
Let people like you swagger down the street
And without scruples?
I was in jail
Not far, you scumbag
I 'm glad we can meet
Looks like I 'm no longer a murder suspect
it 's all thanks to you
I don 't want to look too uneducated
But out of curiosity--
How much does it cost to buy off a murder sheriff now ?
Thanks again
hey, Delfion . . . one more thing
Now, the file is misplaced, understand?
As long as I can get a little more clues
one less cop to be killed on the street
For God 's sake. . .
Don 't drip blood on documents
ma 'am, sorry
Your credit card has been suspended
what ?
Oh no, it 's a new credit card
I was just shopping with it
try again
Madam, I tried three times, and I called the bank
Now, can you use another card?
of course can
Can you come back later?
- hello? - it 's me
I 've been trying to call you but your phone stays off
Because I 'm in a lovely restaurant
Having a lovely lunch, but I don 't have the money to pay the bill
Have you ordered your food already?
I have eaten well
The credit card company called my mom
They say I 'm spending money
- I bought shoes - I don 't know that
Then my mom asked a bunch of questions
I just said my card was stolen
So she cancelled the card
Why are they calling your parents? That 's your account
they are co-signers
Look, if you could explain to the receptionist--
How to explain, my boyfriend 's mom
Cancelled the credit card?
Do you still have a choice?
Either you return the shoes and get the money back
Return the shoes?
It 's unreasonable when you go crazy
嗯, Taita
How are you going to pay the bill?
good afternoon, your neighbor has a package
Karen McCluskey, can you sign?
Isn 't she home? She never goes out
no answer
All right
thanks
Let me be more direct--
You can play tennis, you know all kinds of wine
can speak Chinese
Do all the men in the world want you to die?
Ha ha ha ha
I 'm not that great
I plucked a grey hair from my chest this morning
Haha, I don 't know, I only saw your back
Seriously, nice to chat with you
you, um... .
Really, you made my day happy
I wonder if you would like to meet again sometime . . .
Well, SAM, to tell you the truth
I 'm still dating someone
I just don 't want to deceive you
It 's okay, TINA
By the way . . . this meal is my request
Oh no, how does this work
oh you 're welcome
It 's my pleasure
This is sure to turn into a disaster
it would be nice
ANDREW darling, hurry up, dinner is ready
It 's like we set a trap for him
This is for his good. you will understand
smells good
What do we all eat?
I made homemade bratwurst with sweet and sour cabbage
This is the recipe I found in an old German cookbook
I 'll open the door
Honey, please pour the wine
Isn 't DANIELLE at Wendy 's tonight?
That 's right
Then, why did Mom prepare four seats?
uh, i 'm asking who else is coming for dinner
ANDREW . . . you remember Father SIKES
oh no
Well, Father, please take a seat
I 'm going to prepare a drink
ANDREW . . . long time no see
Yeah, yeah, it 's been a long time
Need a little water? Available with and without bubbles
oh, with bubbles, thank you
So. . .
your mother told me you started
Have a 'sex' interest in boys
I don 't think I need any alcohol
no . . . . . . it 's all for me
over the years
Many young people come to our institution
They hate themselves for some unnatural desire
In a few months, they will find their inner peace
and miraculous peace
Oh
All it takes is a little faith
and desire for change
I 'm sorry, but I, I really don 't want to
Don 't want to discuss my sex life
Well, that 's really not good
because we have to talk
BREE, please don 't do this, let the child speak for himself. please continue
Well, I appreciate your help
I 'm grateful, but I don 't hate myself
so i 'm fine
Boy, I know what adolescence is like
This is a very easy age to get lost
i am not lost
i know who i am
Well . . . if when you want to talk
My door is always open for you
Father, I don 't mean to criticize you, but . . . . . .
Sounds like you 're giving up
We can 't force him to go back to the normal way
He does want to choose another journey
Then, what should we do then
Just stand by and watch him start dating guys?
By the way, the correct word is not 'gay man'
but 'sodomy'
- We 're still enjoying dinner - so?
Then please at least wait until dessert
Calling our son a 'sodomy' again
You can sit around so leisurely, I can 't do it
Hit you up for suggesting a dinner start like this
I knew this dinner was a bad idea
Well, at least I want to do something
please don 't be unhappy
I 'm not happy because there is an obvious problem here
And you all turn a blind eye
In my opinion, as long as ANDREW is happy
Whatever he becomes, our job is to support him
Your father is a pervert
B R E E
He made me whip him, and I did
No wonder you 're so abnormal, look at your parents
Excuse me
what a fun night
You know what, we really should be here a few more times
hey hey good news
I know why you 're so mad at me
i 'm not angry with you
Oh yeah, you 're pissed
but i don 't blame you
Men always turn around me
And I just-- I get so much joy
Had a great time while . . . . . .
What have I done? I totally ignore your feelings
i hate myself too
Mom, I don 't hate you
Well, anyway
from now on
I 'll get you involved in my good deeds
- Good thing? - Hmmm
Your mother did a good job
what have you been doing?
You and I are going on a double date tonight
what ?
TIM has a friend of the box factory
I think the four of us can play together
Have a drink, have a snack, and . . . . . .
no
哦, SUSIE
mom, i 'm sorry
I 'm not in the mood to play these days
SUSIE darling, please I can 't just cancel now
Of course you can
Just give them a call and tell them not to come
-   T I M   -   嗨 ，   S U S I E
this - this is my friend LAMONT
I brought some mint wine
I think she 'll be alright
She never leaves the parcel outside
I mean, how many times has she thrown our mail away?
Just because we didn 't put it away right away
Well, maybe five times
I can 't figure it out, TOM
I wonder if something will happen to her
Well, then go see her
Then if I 'm wrong, I have to
Listen to two hours of nonsense about bunion
then don 't look at her
If six months later, people were on the stairs in the basement
Found her mummified body
What should I tell the children?
'Oh yes, I let Mrs Mc CLUSKEY die'
Yeah, as if the kids still miss her?
Do they still miss
She handed out those dry cleaners coupons for halloween
T O M
Listen, honey, what more can I say?
You are not going, you are not going
So, um, good luck
Honey, I think you 're a little bit annoying now
hi dear, look at my new shoes
Look how beautiful this is?
honey, i want to watch the game
I am sorry
How can you buy new shoes?
Shhh, we 'll talk later, you 're going to watch the game
no, i want to ask
You don 't have any money, so what 's going on?
Oh, you should have heard
Girls meet boys, boys buy things for girls
The girl left happily
what have you done ?
You know what I forgot how generous a man can be
I also forgot that I had so many options -- so many men
What the hell are you talking about?
I don 't need your credit card, CARLOS
I don 't need your money either
But if we want our marriage to last
i need your respect
I won 't tear up that agreement.
No, you will. because if you don 't
I 'll put on my new shoes and leave this house
you are threatening me
No, I 'm just reminding you
i am a beautiful woman
And beautiful women are never alone
Don 't-- I 'm so ticklish
So, um, children 's books, right?
do not! Itchy!
I hope you understand how lucky you are
Not everyone knows their happiness
yeah, it 's worth it
Would you like to sit next to me?
Do not
I 'm really ticklish, hahaha!
Don 't do this!
What 's up ?
For God 's sake, TIM, she 's ticklish!
How many times are you going to listen to her?
oh, that 's a lot of fun
Come on, let 's change a CD
Mom, don 't you think it 's a little late?
come on
you haven 't finished your drink
a perfect night, a perfect ending
good night then
it 's really fun
Also, LAMONT, good luck with your new invention
Well, it 's just 11:30
i want to go to a nightclub
I know there 's a nice place right across the state line
- let 's go - we 're all going to have a good time
Mom, hold back!
You 're not going to get into the car with them both alone, are you?
you don 't know them very well
I see people 's intuition is very clever
always smart, SUSIE, you know
You 've been married four times
Yeah, but it 's the same person twice
mother
SUSIE, please, you 're embarrassing me
Oh, am I embarrassing you?
Yes, I have endured
I 've been trying all night
so you don 't seem so stubborn
And you refuse my help
That, what you call help
Just let TIM do it to you?
hey! you can 't talk to your mother like that
she is a good lady
TIM, can you just leave it alone?
Yeah, take care of yourself
Hey, what 's the matter with you, man?
dude, you 're having a big fight with her mother
This annoys me too. come on, SUSIE
we go inside
'Let 's go in'? LAMONT, save it
You don 't even want to get anything
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
why did you do this ?
I just-- just wanted to do something good
Stop acting like this night is just to help me, okay?
You want to have fun on your own date
And that LAMONT also wants to find a partner
- It 's not true! - Oh yes, it 's true
Well, that 's right, it 's true
i want to have fun on a date
Is there anything you can 't do?
You know how sad I 've been since I broke up with Morty
Yes, I know that 's why I 'm so neurotic
Did you know that the biggest difference between me and you is that . . . . . .
You will be sad but you will keep going
And I . . . just sad
I know you are sad
no, mom, i 'm not sad
I 'm not stubborn either
I 'm haggard, but you think I need it
just a little aspirin
MORTY is just one of your many men
But MIKE . . . he 's the only one for me
Why don 't you understand?
I 'm LYNETTE, anyone?
Mrs. Mc CLUSKEY ?
Mrs. Mc CLUSKEY, how are you?
How did you get in?
Well, Mrs. MULLINS has a spare key
Why don 't you open the door?
'Cause I hope you 'll leave
Are you still taking your arthritis medicine?
I do not need it anymore
Sometimes the pain goes away on its own
Well, uh, is that why you can 't open the door?
your hands ?
Mrs. Mc CLUSKEY, do you have anyone
Can someone help you -- a relative, or a friend?
I 'm very good
Alright alright
before you go . . .
Open these up, will you? And-- take these pills out again
OK
And don 't touch those pills with your hands
God knows what your ghosts have touched
I don 't want to get pink eye.
You 're such a stubborn old man, you know?
uh, that 's absurd
How can they give you the caps that keep the kids from opening the bottles?
First thing in the morning, I 'll take you to the pharmacy
get you some new pill bottles
Don 't sell my favor, you don 't like me
I don 't want you to do so much for me just because you feel obligated
Let me tell you, half of life is obligation
You don 't want to go to your husband 's company
Christmas party, but you went
you don 't want to sell candy
So your kids can buy piccolo, but you do it anyway
You attended your third cousin 's wedding
you pack the dry cleaning
This is life - it is duty
And you are my duty now
So tomorrow morning, I 'll pick you up
Then we go to the pharmacy
Ah, I am touched by your unmistakable sympathy
we don 't have to be friends
but we are two humans
live on the same land
we can at least try
help each other occasionally
do you know?
i 'm taking this
OK
see you tomorrow morning
9 : 0 0 pick me up
ANDREW, come here. i want you to see this
Um, what are you looking at?
I 'm looking at your childhood photos
look at that one
How old was I then?
only four weeks old
I didn 't tell you before, but when I gave birth to you
Something unexpected happened
The umbilical cord wraps around your neck
you stopped breathing
The room suddenly became very quiet
I know you 're in danger
So I calmly said to the doctor
do not worry about me
to save your life
when i said i would die for you
That 's not a joke
I was serious
Um. . .
I 'm going for a sandwich
ANDREW , please, go and talk to Father SIKES
Oh, for God 's sake--
He can guide you, that will help
Mom, I don 't need any help, I 'm fine
Why are you so entangled in this matter?
Because if you can 't change your current situation
you won 't be able to go to heaven
You, um . . . you- - you think I can 't go to heaven?
Yes
but i need you there
I would be lonely without you
Well . . . then I think I 'll just go and talk to Father SIKES
Oh ANDREW , thank you so much
You don 't know how important this is to me
oh my-- my god
Um, are you all right?
oh no, i just fell down the stairs
I 'm fine, what 's the matter?
Susan still loves you
oh, um. . . ok
You see, now is not the time to talk about this
she misses you
SOPHIE , I just discovered
someone close to me died
I really need to figure out what to do
So I don 't have time to think about SUSAN right now
She was very, very unhappy, if you could--
I really can 't
I am sorry
I swear to God what I say here today
Never leak
So. . .
What do you want to say?
Is such that- -
I lied to my parents
i 'm not gay
you are not ?
not really
Look, I 'm full of thoughts
Just get out of that damn training camp
So I lied to my parents
I also told them I was worried
feel for others
And . . . they did as I said
They are like tools
Excuse me, I was just trying to figure out--
Are you a homosexual?
look. . .
I love vanilla ice cream, understand?
but every now and then
I would also like to taste the chocolate
Do you know what I mean ?
yes, but god would want you to only like vanilla
i don 't believe in god
You do not believe ?
sorry no
You know what, your mother is going to be heartbroken
You pray so hard that you can change
Well, that 's good news
I 'll change - - change drastically
I - I don 't quite understand
You know what my mom said to me last night?
She said she didn 't think I was going to heaven
Can you believe it ?
I 'm sure she didn 't mean to hurt your feelings
But the only way to heaven
is to repent of the sins you have committed
when she told me that
I suddenly understood how to get back to her
from now on
I want to be a good boy
I 'm going to eat those vegetables
I - I want to get good grades
I will answer her with 'yes, ma 'am' and 'no, ma 'am'
I want her to believe
God gave her a little angel
until one day
when she least expects it
i will do something bad
bad enough to shake her faith
I mean, really destroy her
Until that day . . .
I can go to heaven
(Yes, life is like a journey)
(A journey where it 's best to have someone by your side)
(Of course, that partner can be anyone)
Mrs Mc CLUSKEY !
I 'm going to be late for the doctor
(probably a neighbor across the street. . . )
I 'm here, don 't rush
Give
No more postnuptial agreements
(or the man by the pillow)
(Possibly a mother with good intentions at heart . . . )
Thank you for your help, Father
thank you, BREE
(or a malicious child)
very thought provoking
(despite our goodwill)
(but some of us still lose partners along the way)
(From now on, there are only miserable winds and rains left in the journey)
( look )
