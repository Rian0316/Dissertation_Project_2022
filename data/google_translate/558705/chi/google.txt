we can 't tolerate them anymore

She got a pistol to kill herself
Why are you keeping it?
Many, many questions were raised
How are you?
I think he must be hiding something
Many clues have been found
What do you want to hire me for?
Someone gave this to my wife I want to know who
Do you have the time?
I found this at Eddie 's
I found this under the bed
This is not mine
Speaking of a load of dirty laundry
Every community will have a woman like Albert F rom Every woman like Mrs F rom
there will be a cat
Every time she goes on a trip, she arranges for her friend to look after her beloved cat
And this time she had to arrange for her neighbor, Susan Mayer
Mrs F rom loves Susan but her common sense tells her that when bad luck befalls Susan Mayer
Drinking cold water will clog your teeth
Bad things keep happening
Anything extraordinary happens from ordinary places to extraordinary occasions

When she waved goodbye to Susan, she worried that Susan 's bad luck would continue
Its cat will also be infected with misfortune
Mr. Visker

it 's time for dinner

very strange
Cats can open drawers by themselves, can they?
Could it be that you opened it yourself in the morning?
absolutely impossible
Whoa, did someone break in?
Mr. V isker?

It 's time for Susan time to turn

News of the mysterious intruder spreads through the community like wildfire
That night we all came together to confront the fact that the whole community is becoming increasingly dangerous
Mrs Art Greenberd said someone peeked through the window as soon as she took a shower
Bob Fisk says an anonymous government agency is listening in on their phone
Hellen Vail said a group of local youths kept harassing her
There are three reasons why . . . . . . that night they decided to ask Officer Tompson to help them and give them safety advice
You have the opportunity to monitor them You can sign up for day or night surveillance
I know this may seem exaggerated but regular precautions can control even a premeditated crime
Any other questions?
Well then, be careful
In fact, I do have a question
Do you have the time?
Sure, can I help?
I 've met intruders and found evidence
Proof?
I think it 's left after the trespasser did the crime I haven 't touched it
Why don 't you bring this to the police department to investigate?
I tried but they didn 't pay attention Apparently From home nothing was missing
I 'm sorry they did
They are so unprofessional
thanks

So you think it 's really worth paying attention to?
yes i promise i will handle it
great, bye

you two
Stop hitting and go to bed
I 'm not sleepy yet
you need to go upstairs
hey we want to play for a while

give me, give me
go up, go, go
goodbye




Why don 't you sit with Mike tonight?
I thought you guys would be a couple
I started to think so too
But there are many ominous signs
The sign I see is that sexy police officer
He 's been staring at you all night
Did you notice?
Baby, believe me when he looked at me, I noticed
I really appreciate you staying and helping me
oh don 't say that
I was going to organize the party myself but the kids are going on a trip and camping stuff is thrown all over the place
You 're so kind, now that I 'm talking about this, I have something else I 'd like your help with
Both of your kids went to the Bargerla A cademy, didn 't they?
Yes
We need to get them to enroll there too
But we didn 't even get a chance to interview
You want me to recommend you your twins?
yes you can tell them
how well these two kids are doing
Are you trying to make me lie?

yes i think i made it clear
Well, Cliff and I are respected, but if I lie, our reputation is ruined
Yes, but we don 't go to school until they graduate
you won 't have any more children
What are you worried about?
But I 'll still have grandchildren. It doesn 't matter to you, does it?
no, it really matters






They quarreled again
It 's the second time this week
Not at all when Mary Alice was alive
What an unfortunate family!
Some families don 't fight but that doesn 't mean they 're happy
The next day when the whole community is patrolling for potential burglars
Gabrielle meets an uninvited trespasser in her home
S olis mom
What are you doing here?
I came to see my son and daughter-in-law
See what he looks like?
Does Carlos know you 're coming?
I don 't know, he likes surprises
come over, Gabrielle, come over
Family should hug more
whether she likes him or not
wow what a beautiful boat
30 feet tall?
3 2
That 's great, sure to drive
feel like flying
Bargerla A cademy has a lot of great classes I want to introduce to you
That 's great
great
If we decide to take your child
The Scavos, honestly your children have a very ordinary educational background but Van D e K amp mentioned that they are twins?
Yes, true identical twins
You can 't tell them apart
Bargerla A cademy has its own research school
Twins would be interesting material
yes they are very unique
even has its own twin secret language
Is it, Tom?
yes very amazing
Not too amazing, they have high IQs
They haggle and argue with each other
Excuse me, he 's just giving a random example
Please say, Mr. Lens
i want to meet the twins
Any idea why? I 'm going to put them on the Master-me list
Excellent
thank you so much
What is the Master-me list?
I observe them
Observed?
See how they play with other kids how they react to authority, that 's it


very good
great
Hi
H i
Are the kids ready?
Almost there, they will be sent to the station
nice i miss them
Did you hear about someone breaking into Mrs. From 's house one night?
heard
As if nothing was taken
That doesn 't mean there 's no danger
may want to sexually assault
Want to violate Mrs From?
That 's too tasteless.
R ex , that 's not the point
The point is that I don 't feel safe and I want you to stay at night
You can get an A in everything
you are almighty
If someone breaks in you 'll break in to protect me
Reex, you 're all gone, leaving me alone at home
For the first time in 17 years
Honey, I know it sounds hard but marriage counselors don 't work anymore
You should learn to get used to living alone
Well, that does sound sad
what are you doing?
This is for kids to eat while traveling
Come on, I 've been living in a motel
eat badly
Honey, Marriage Counselors Are Not Working Now
You need to get used to your poor cooking
hi beauty
I stopped by to tell you that I have sent your evidence to the police laboratory
Yeah? That 's great
I think it will work out
very good
oh sorry
It does not matter

I 'll call you if you allow
You are a really nice and interesting person
But I might not agree
you have boyfriend?
Yes, so to speak
You can say that?
It 's hard to explain, only I understand
907A , there are cases
I 'll be there soon
I have to go
Apparently a hostage incident
Wow
Did you really reject me?
My self-esteem is hard to accept
I am sorry
I 'm going to rescue the hostages and let the criminals compromise
If you can 't save it, you should blame yourself
Blame yourself?
It 's hard to rescue a hostage if you don 't feel good about yourself
I 'm dead anyway
ok i 'll go out with you
Great, I 'll call you
Now that you 're on a date, can you tell me what happened to 907A?
Someone 's TV is broken
low-level lie
i call you


(French) I want to practice yoga
Mom, just a moment, I 'll be right there
Do you need to practice now?
my mom is here
She showed up at my house without any notice
she is family
She doesn 't need an invite, anyway
it 's the rule
Mom, you surprised me
I drove 2000 miles just to chat here
She asked me what am I doing here?
she is very unhappy
uh-huh?
I gave her everything she wanted but the result is the same I feel like we 're drifting further and further apart
I 'm starting to think maybe, maybe . . . . . you think she 's cheating on you?
I think so
We can discuss your problems but don 't look like this

do you have proof?
no, just a feeling
I also feel like your dad has an affair with that waitress I guessed it right
trust your feelings
what should I do?
you don 't have to do anything
I 'll handle it
thank you mom
I 'm sorry I hit you but we have to be strong and face the problem and don 't cry
we have to find a solution
As residents here struggle to take steps to guard against trespassers
She 's working on a plan to send the kids to Bargerla A cademy
You two, get up, hurry up
We have a plan today
hurry up


mother
come on, baby

Go, go, go, that 's it, kids

Mom, I 'm tired
hey, i can still see that bunker isn 't deep enough
Are your children always this slack?
They are always shy at first
see how focused they are
he likes this course

(See you at the motel)
Mom, I 'll be back soon
i go to the store
Gabrielle, I 'm going with you
I 'm going to buy something too
No, no, I don 't go to the supermarket
i 'm going to the laundry
I also have some clothes to wash
I 'll be back in a while
I 'm going to make a mask
I have a face too
Hi Mike
Hi, how are you doing?
just came over to say hello
Hello?
Do you remember that cop at the community party?
He agreed to help me with Mrs. From 's evidence.
Yeah? Is there a situation?
or trespasser crime
The strange thing is that the cop wants to ask me out
Oh?
I agreed
I 'm just curious what you think
Do you need my permission to go out on a date?
No, I just want to hear your opinion
I have no opinion
good, good, good, thank you
Susan, wait, sorry

My life is complicated now, really
you don 't have to explain
S u s a n
It 's complicated, I get it
Paul？ Paul
Oh, hello, Zack, sorry, it doesn 't matter if the door is open, come in



Is your father at home?
We are planning a patrol today
He 's out of town again
Oh, then I 'll prepare it myself
Oh this place is so clean
my mom likes clean
she will be proud of you
What happened to your wiper?
after my mother died
I use it to clear blood
Oh
I 'll tell my dad you 've been here
OK
Zack, do you have friends for dinner?
Do you shop a lot?
yeah, so?

The woman who shopped often because she had nothing better to do
What do you want to say?
What if you have children?
Then I 'm just saying that kids make your life meaningful
you 're too busy taking care of them you don 't have time to think if you 're happy
you know why i don 't like you
I invite you to go shopping and you try to beat me
you didn 't invite me
I came by myself
you 've been looking at your watch
Do you want to go somewhere else?
no!
I don 't like always the kids turning
I love my life now
very fulfilling
I 'm sorry, my daughter-in-law
very fulfilling
Did he let you down?
I told him someone asked me out
Wish Mike was jealous but he didn 't say anything
Did you look into his eyes?
you have to look into his eyes
I looked carefully for a long time but nothing happened

Oh, thanks
How is their school going?

you go on to say
Wow
The Mike thing really makes me sad
How much do you like him?
It 's my fault, maybe just imagining
I have nothing to do with this man
Men love to flirt with others
I 've seen flirts make me think he 's friendly, trustworthy, honest
This has already happened. He smiled at me three times. We went to pick out wedding items.
i 'm just a mess
But to be fair, it 's your choice
I chose Carol
We 've been dating for a few months and I 've filled the gap
And then got married and it was a disaster
Do you think Mike is a man like Carol?
I have no idea
What is it that my life is complicated
I can 't do anything sitting here
You are late, what are you doing?
I screwed up, I got into From 's house
Almost got caught What is a handicap?
Someone found my tool by accident
Is something wrong?
This is the suburbs, no big deal
But the police checked it out, including me
It 's a bit difficult to start now
How sweet the sun, how happy they laughed
you really let me down
When it comes to light, you disappear
But you 're going to be repairing the neighbor 's plumbing until this time.
The longer I 'm here, the more I feel like I 'm doing something wrong
the neighbors are nice
My money doesn 't think so

thanks
stop screwing up
I 'll go get some drinks
Do you want it?
listen, don 't get mad at me
I waited for you there for almost three hours
I spent my month 's money for that room
It was not my fault
my mom keeps staring at me
Yeah, so why are you here now?
she 's sitting there watching her mexican soap opera
The innocent daughter seduces the fleeing De espreto
I sneaked away
Didn 't let the old woman know I was gone
Don 't do that, I 'm sorry
Did you say it? I wanted to reject you
oh you must be kidding
You know I 'm starting to think maybe I should find someone my age
john , young girls are not for you
I don 't think the problem is just that
I think so
Why do you want to go back to the life you didn 't want to live
I have no idea
maybe you 're tired of me
no, i really want to be with you
let 's stop arguing
G a b r i e l l e
Damn, that virgin is over so soon?
i want you so much
when can i see you again
Tomorrow we will meet in front of the store
What about that woman?
Don 't worry, I 'll find a way
G a b r i e l l e ， G a b r i e l l e
coming
sponsor? They want us to sponsor?
Obviously we 're competing with another family
Generous sponsorship will surely make our kids beat them
How generous? $5000
we don 't have that much money
I told them that too
So what should we do?
Certainly not public schools. Let 's move to another district.
we can 't move anymore
Time to try homeschooling
I know you will say this
This has many advantages
They will be better when they grow up
But you gotta be with them all day until they grow up
Darling, sometimes you have to make a sacrifice
especially for children
Why do you push them all to me and you get away with it
you can take care of them
I 've never eaten this before
it 's for christmas
I 'll try to make it before the festival
So in case something goes wrong
I still have time
you must love christmas
You decorate such a beautiful Christmas tree by yourself
I 'm obsessed with festivals
I always decorate the best Christmas tree
My mom and I always come to decorate the Christmas tree
Christmas will be very different this year
Z ack , my mother died when i was very young
she was in a car accident
Oh
In fact, just before Christmas
Our family is singing and the dog is barking because everyone in our family is humming
That scene was like a bolt from the blue
My mom crossed the street to get a neighbor 's gift
And then was crushed to the bone
Wow
My family went to the hospital and only I stayed at home because I was young
I look out the window
I saw my mother 's blood on the street and no one was there to clean it up I picked up tools to wash the blood away
when cleaning up
I feel much better
I 've never said this before
That 's the most meaningful one you 've never told anyone?
Yes, you are right
I have one too, kind of a secret, really
I know why my mom committed suicide
you know?
Yes, some bad things I did
Zack, what did you do?
Zack, baby
No, I shouldn 't have said that
I 'm sorry, I, I . . . . . .
Z ack , I won 't tell your dad
No, I just can 't . . . . .
Zack, it 's okay
Can 't believe Zack told you this
What else did he say?
He also said that Mary Alice committed suicide
because of what he did
Did you not ask more?
I tried but he got nervous
He started shaking, then left
It 's getting weirder
we should call the police
do you know? We don 't have that note anymore
We gave it to Paul
So to make a breakthrough, let Zack talk a little bit more
girls, you don 't know
That poor child is terrified
God lets women influence men
There will be a way but how?
I have no idea
How do you usually deal with R ex?
Hi Zackry
Are you free for dinner tonight?
Can
Because you put me in the holiday mood last night I made turkey, potatoes and eggnog
Have you tried that traditional eggnog?
never tasted
You 'll love it, it 's very tasty


Guys, can you guys... . . . .



Mommy mommy
he 's hitting me, mom
Mommy mommy
Gabrielle, you bought me enough
don 't buy any more
Mom, you 're too old-fashioned
Need to try new clothes

try this, go for it, wear it
So olis, how are you doing?
this is too tight
This is slimming and you will look amazing
Gabrielle, this is not for me
i can 't breathe
maybe i 'm wrong
Change your clothes and I 'll go to the bookstore
Gabrielle, etc.
I will go with you
No no, just a little while
wait, i 'm going with you
wait, Gabrielle, wait

Madam, can I see your bag?
I 'm in a hurry
very punctual
I 'm telling you I don 't know how this top got into my bag
security guard!
Well, you keep this damn top
I 'm going to find my wife
Do not touch me
How dare you do this to me!
Madam, you want to come with us
G a b r i e l l e ！
Hello
hello it 's me
Hi Reex, what happened?
I was about to have dinner at the motel when I remembered
Would you like to have dinner with me?
Mrs. V an D e K amp
do you know? I found my mom 's Christmas stuff
Oh, I was just about to tell you
I 'm really sorry, something very important happened and I have to cancel our dinner
real?
we meet again next time
We 'll have a holiday dinner too, I promise, bye
I think of a man K elly H osteter
She used to spit on my new shoes
K e l l y   H o s t e t e r
Kelly Hosteter, look, she 's broke
Unfortunate, I mean I expected it
Oh, we had a great time together
Yeah, time flies so fast
When do you work?
The watch says 20 minutes, but I say no
Great job!
Oh, thanks
dear, you are reading a homeschooling book
Yeah, it can give me some good advice

Great, what have you learned?
We all agree that one person in the family should stay at home and take care of the children while the other person goes out and earns a living
I suddenly remembered that I earned more than you when I worked
What did you say?
Just now you talked about sacrifice and I suddenly realized that I 've made a lot of sacrifices in the past 6 years
I gave up my career
If you need to sacrifice
I think it 's your turn
you mean? so if i go back to work you stay home with the kids
I can 't be with the kids as a whole
i 'm going crazy
aha
hey, i get it, homeschooling doesn 't work
So where are we going to get the donation money?

How to do? How to do? How to do?
Homeschooling doesn 't work She looks in despair at the horizon on the photo Suddenly there is a solution
into her sight
Oh no
Mmmm!
He 's going to propose to you
don 't promise him
But what if I like him?
hey i thought this was sent to the lab
Well, you got caught
What does that mean?
Listen, Susan, no police department or lab would take the time to check this
This is not a high priority case
Why didn 't you tell me directly?
I was just kidding
It 's no big deal, right?
It 's okay if this is the first time you lied, but no
alright, I got it
You want me to beg you, look at me
i beg your pardon

Don 't be like this, don 't be mad at this little thing
I know what kind of person you are
You and Carol are of the same type
It 's over between us, it 's over for both of you
Oh come on, my queen
What are you going to do? It 's not safe here
I 'd rather look for opportunities on the street, thanks
How would I choose this type of girl?
Excuse me, I 'm lost
You better get really lost
this is my place
yeah very nice location i am sorry to disturb you while you are working
Can you tell me where there is a payphone?
I have change, $5
There must be something wrong with my income
That 's right, all right, thank you
Hey, do you want to use my phone?
i 'll wait for you
Thank you so much, you saved me
sorry baby
Oh, it 's okay, you 're busy
Oh, don 't answer the phone, help
Pick up the phone, Julie
thank god don 't ask any questions
Find someone to pick me up back I 'm at N inteen F oster C orner
Hello Baby
Thanks, no, I want to take a break
Hurry up, please
I am sorry
I got a call, someone broke into my house?
Your neighbors force their way into your home and move things inside
We sent people to investigate what we think . . . . . . .
We encounter a lot of this
But this time is different
let me be straightforward
He cut down one of my Christmas trees
I 'm afraid so
Zack, why are you doing this?
I have no idea
Please remove the handcuffs
We 've confirmed it was him who broke through the window
It 's nothing to argue about
All right

Z a c k ？
How are you?
fine
So how was your date?
I can 't believe July asked you to come
she will die soon
come on in
where is your prince?
that cop lied to me
I don 't want to say this again
I 'll just ask
Yes, apparently there is a top in her bag
I don 't know, Carlos,
People get confused when they get old
She probably thought she paid
No, no, it 's alright
ok i will tell her goodbye
Solis mom, Carlos says he can 't come back for dinner
just the two of us
Want something to eat?
I 'm not hungry
Okay, then I 'm leaving
Don 't go, we need to talk
this is important, please take a seat

I married Solis when I was 16
He started beating me a few months after we got married
I was young then and didn 't know what to do
I don 't know what to do either
He got so bad I even begged God to let me die but God gave me a reason to live
C a r l o s ！
Ah, he 's a very sweet kid
My husband doesn 't deserve to be a father at all
he never hugs him
He yelled at him for no reason
So olis came home drunk one night when Carlos was four years old and he beat Carlos hard
Something in me exploded out of nowhere
All of a sudden I found a way to make myself strong I found a way to make Solis never dare to touch me and Carlos again
how did you do that?
If you have a brave heart God will give you the solution
Carlos said his dad ran off with the waitress
Well, that 's what I told him
All moms know how to protect their kids but some take it more seriously than others
I don 't know why you told me this?
i think you know
uh, i know it 's my fault, sorry i didn 't stop you from going out with him
It 's none of your business, I 'm not angry
It 's my own business
It does not matter
I 'm angry because I like you so much but I really don 't know anything about you
Oh, what do you want to know?
your favorite food?
Mexico food
your favorite sport?
football favorite band
K a r s i t e l o
He 's a singer, not a band
he 's a member of a band
What do you think about me?
Excuse me, are you serious?








Mrs. V an D e K amp
Hi Zack, I want to come see if you guys are okay?
no problem
you sure?
Yes
Well then, see you tomorrow
i 'm fine
Zack people instinctively look for intruders
prevent others from breaking in from the outside
But there are always people who force their way into our lives just like those we invite into our circles

But the most annoying thing is the people who are standing on the outside and peeping in, people you can 't really get to know.
