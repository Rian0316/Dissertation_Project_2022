 We can 't economise in accommodation ?
 ( WOMAN ) 'Fraid not , Minister . - Data- processing equipment ?
 - Not possible .
 - The further education budget ?
 - Sadly , it can 't be .
 At least the universities won 't cost us as much , with overseas students paying fees covering education costs .
 - Unless you make exceptions ... ?
 - No , sorry , no exceptions .
 At least , that 's one saving . - Minister , it 's ...
 - Yes , of course .
 That 's all , I 'm afraid .
 Meeting over .
 - Thank you - Thank you .
 Before Sir Humphrey comes , Number 10 asked you to approve recommendations for the honours list .
 That 's the eighth time you 've asked .
 Are honours the most serious concern of this department ?
 They are to the people on the list .
 Some haven 't slept for days !
 What are they worried about ?
 Ministers never veto honours .
 It 's possible .
 They 're worried about the delay . How do people know they 're listed ?
 It 's marked " Strictly Confidential " .
 Oh , Minister ...
 Silly of me .
 If they 'd put some of that effort into cutting expenditure ...
 How can I make people want economies in the same way they want OBEs and KCBs ?
 I 've been thinking ...
 No , no , no .
 - What ?
 - No , no , nothing ...
 Spit it out . It 's not my place , and I couldn 't possibly recommend it ...
 Suppose you were to refuse to recommend any honours for civil servants who hadn 't cut their budgets by 5 % ... ?
 - Bernard !
 - Sorry , Minister ...
 No , Bernard !
 It 's brilliant !

 It 's the answer .
 It 's the only hold we have over the civil servants .
 I can 't stop their pay rises or their promotions .
 I don 't even write their reports , but I can withhold their honours !
 - Well done .
 - You thought of it , Minister . - No , no , you thought of it .
 - No , you thought of it .
 Please !
 Just a touch , please .
 Thank you very much . Splendid dinner .
 I always enjoy my visits here .
 I 'm afraid this could be your last .
 Why ?
 Did I pass the port the wrong way ?
 - Tell him , Bursar .
 - The college 's going to the wall . It 's your new policy of charging overseas students full rates .
 Other Oxford colleges can cope , but we 've always had many overseas students here at Baillie .
 You simply charge them a full fee , no problem .
 Unless they can 't pay £4, 000 a year .
 They won 't come . I 've been all over the USA , selling them the idea of an Oxford education .
 Africa is crawling with British professors frantically trying to flog sociology courses to the natives .
 And India and the Middle East .
 Competition is cut- throat .
 Why not fill up vacancies with British undergraduates ?
 I don 't think that 's awfully funny , Humphrey .
 - I wasn 't trying to be funny .
 - Anything but home students !
 - Why ?
 - We only get 500 a head for them .
 We 'd have to take 400 to replace a mere 50 foreigners .
 The staff/ student ratio would go from 1 : 10 to 1 : 34 .
 We 'd have classrooms , dormitories ...
 like Wormwood Scrubs ! Or the University of Sussex !
 The Master thinks the pictures may fetch £20- 30, 000 .
 The pictures and silver together might just pay the mortgage interest .
 Dear , oh , dear !
 Or we could get the Government to treat us as an exception .
 Interestingly , Humphrey , it seems to be your Minister who has the authority .

 How might one persuade a Minister of the importance of Baillie College ?
 Why not get him down to a High Table dinner ?
 Is he of the intellectual calibre to understand our case ?
 Oh , yes !
 It 's intelligible to anyone with the intellectual calibre of Winnie the Pooh !
 Quite !
 And Hacker is of the intellectual calibre of Winnie the Pooh ?
 Oh , yes !
 On his day .
 - Morning , Minister .
 - Morning , Humphrey .
 Two things , Minister . Firstly , the departmental recommendations for the honours list .
 - The honours list again !
 - Yes , Minister . - Let 's leave that for the moment .
 - We can 't leave it , Minister .
 - It 's getting near the five weeks .
 - Five weeks ? All recipients are notified five weeks before .
 It gives them time to refuse .
 When did a civil servant last refuse an honour ? !
 Somebody in the Treasury refused a knighthood .
 - When ? - I think it was 1496 .

 - Why ?
 - He 'd already got one . - If you 've approved the list ...

 - Humphrey ... ... did you know that 20 % of honours go to civil servants ?
 A fitting tribute to their devotion to duty .
 That 's what they get paid for . The rest of us have to do something special to get an honour .
 They work for years with the mentally handicapped to get an MBE .
 Your knighthoods simply come up with the rations .
 Minister , her Majesty 's civil servants spend their lives working for a modest wage and at the end retire into obscurity .
 Honours are a small reward for a lifetime of loyal , self- effacing discretion and devoted service to the nation .
 - " A modest wage " ?
 - Alas , yes . You get over £30, 000 a year !
 - That 's £7, 000 more than I get .
 - But still relatively modest .
 Relative to whom ?
 Elizabeth Taylor , for example . You are not relative to Elizabeth Taylor .
 There are important differences .
 Indeed , yes .
 She didn 't get a first at Oxford .
 And retire into obscurity ? ! You take a massive pension and become directors of oil companies .
 But very obscure directors .
 You 're in no danger of the sack .
 In industry , you get the boot .
 In the civil service , if you screw up , I get the boot !
 - Very droll , Minister .
 The list ...
 - No , Humphrey . I 'll not approve any honour to any civil servant who hasn 't earned it .
 - What do you mean , " earned it " ?
 - I mean " earned it " . - Done something to deserve it .
 - But that 's unheard of !
 My new policy is to withhold all honours from civil servants who do not make a cut in their budgets of 5 % per year .
 Your silence indicates approval ?
 It does not !
 Where did you get that preposterous idea ?
 It ...
 ... just came to me .
 - It 's ridiculous !
 Unheard of !
 The whole idea is ...
 It 's ... It strikes at the very roots of ...
 It 's the beginning of the end !
 The thin end of the wedge !
 A Bennite solution !
 What next ?
 Abolition of the monarchy ?
 Don 't be absurd . The system has worked so well in the past .
 It hasn 't .
 - Give it a fair trial . - I thought you might say that ...
 The Most Noble Order of the Garter was founded in 1348 by Edward ill .
 It 's at the end of its trial period now .
 Minister , if you block honours pending economies , you might create a dangerous precedent .
 If we do the right thing now , we 'll have to do the right thing next time ?
 - Nothing would get done at all !
 - On the contrary .
 - Many things must be done , but ... ... nothing done for the first time !
 No , Minister ! I 'm fully seized of your aims , and I 'll try to put them into practice .
 To that end ,
 I recommend we set up a committee with broad terms of reference , so we 're in a position to think through the various implications and decide based on long- term considerations rather than rush prematurely into precipitate and ill- conceived actions which might have unforeseen repercussions .



 You mean " no " ?
 I mean , as far as one can see , in the fullness of time ...
 No , no , no , Humphrey .
 You know me :
 Action now !
 ( MUTTERS ) Action now . Nobody in their right mind can want honours .
 They encourage sycophancy , snobbery , jealousy , and civil servants shouldn 't get them all !
 - But Minister ...
 - No , no !
 I 'm sorry .
 I have decided .
 - Your other point ?
 - Other point ?
 - You had two .
 - Did I ? Yes , I 'm sorry .
 The shock !
 Yesterday , I had representations from Baillie College , Oxford .
 Grants for overseas students ...
 They 'll lose millions a year .
 They must just take more British students .
 Nothing would please them more , but you see ... ... Baillie has many foreign students , and there could be repercussions at the schools of tropical medicine , international law , and the Arabic department may have to close down .


 We can 't educate foreigners at the taxpayer 's expense .
 Not just foreigners .
 If the diplomatic service had nowhere to immerse its recruits , the results could be catastrophic , with a pro- Israeli Foreign Office !
 What would happen to our oil policy ?
 Its recruits must go elsewhere .
 Where else would they learn Arabic ?
 Arabia ?
 Baillie College has an outstanding record .
 - It 's filled our jails for years .
 - Jails ?
 Yes . The letters " JB " are the finest honour in the Commonwealth .
 - " JB " ?
 - " Jailed by the British " .
 Gandhi , Nkrumah , Makarios ,
 Ben- Gurion , Kenyatta , Nehru , Mugabe .
 The list of leaders is endless and contains several of our students .
 " Our students " ?
 Humphrey ... which college did you go to ?
 That is quite beside the point .
 I like being beside the point .
 Humour me , Humphrey .
 Which college did you go to ?
 Was it Baillie , by any strange coincidence ?
 It so happens ...
 I am a Baillie man , but that has nothing to do with it !
 No , of course not .
 Perish the thought .
 Naughty .
 Yes ?
 The division , Minister . That rather settles it .

 No more time .
 Am I voting " aye " or " no " ?
 - " No " .
 It 's a ...
 - I don 't want to know what it is .
 I don 't want to go through the wrong door .
 ( KNOCK AT DOOR )


 Arnold ?
 Humphrey !
 Do sit down . Hope you don 't mind my dragging you here .
 - No , please .
 - I was worried about your Minister .
 Linking honours to economies .
 That ?
 A lot of nonsense .
 Good .
 You mean it 's not true ? Not exactly .
 That is , he did just mention it .
 - But ...
 - But what ? I can 't find any effective arguments against it .
 - It 's the thin end of the wedge .
 - That 's what I said .
 - A Bennite solution .
 - I said that .
 - Where will it end ?
 - That 's what I said .
 No , it 's intolerable , but ... ... irresistible .
 I 'm not reprimanding you , I don 't know the facts well enough .
 I 'd like your assurance that he won 't be putting it into practice .
 I certainly hope he won 't . I 'm not sure that hopes are good enough .
 If he applied it to your department , the contagion would spread !
 Every department ! - Presumably , we can count on you ?

 - I shall certainly try .
 - But ... it 's rather tricky .
 - You know what you 're doing .
 This could cause people to reflect on your soundness .
 I 've no doubts about you myself , but ...
 - I thought a chat would be useful .
 - Absolutely .
 Thank you . By the way , I had our college master on the phone .
 - He said you dined at Baillie .
 - Right !
 I assured them your Minister would treat them as a special case .

 Yes ...
 Yes ... I 've got the Minister coming to a benefactors ' dinner .
 Good .
 Sound man . I must be getting over to Number 10 .
 Thanks for dropping in .
 Pleasure ... ... Arnold .
 Sir Humphrey saw the Cabinet Secretary and got the most frightful wigging .
 Really tore him off a strip because of your economies- honours scheme .
 - Your scheme . - We 've been through all that .
 Sorry .
 My scheme .
 Why wig someone as high up as Humphrey ?
 Normally , it 's civilised , but this time it was no- holds- barred .
 Sir Arnold said he wasn 't actually reprimanding him .
 - Bad as that , was it ?
 - Yes . He suggested some people might not think he was sound .
 - A real punch- up !
 - Indeed .
 What has Sir Arnold to fear ?
 He has all the honours he could want .
 - He has his " G " .
 - " G " ? - You get your " G " after your " K " .
 - You speak in riddles .
 First you get the CMG , then the KCMG and the GCMG , the Command of the Order of St Michael and St George ,
 Knight Grand Cross of St George . In the service , CMG stands for " Call Me God " .
 And KCMG for " Kindly Call Me God " .
 And GCMG ?
 " God Calls Me God " .
 Why should Sir Arnold worry ?
 He has his full quota of honours .
 Nowhere near !
 There 's a peerage , the CH , the OM , the Knight of the Thistle ...
 Knight of the Thistle ?
 Who for ? - Scotsmen and donkeys ? !
 - There 's a distinction .
 You haven 't met the Scottish Nationalists !
 - How do they award the Thistle ?
 - A committee sits on it .
 Does Humphrey think I 'll change university policy over High Table dinner ?
 I believe Baillie College give a very good dinner , Minister .
 - How much further ?
 - A few minutes .
 The M40 's good .
 So 's the M4 ...
 Why did we get two really good roads to Oxford before any to Southampton or Dover or any of the ports ?
 Nearly all our Permanent Secretaries went to Oxford , Minister , and most Oxford colleges give very good dinners .
 - The Cabinet allow that ?
 - Certainly not .
 They said no motorway to take civil servants to Oxford , unless there was one to take Ministers hunting in the shires .
 That 's why the M1 stopped in Leicestershire !
 Oh , come !

 What about the M11 just completed ?
 Doesn 't Cambridge give as good dinners ?
 Yes , of course , but it 's been years since Transport had a Permanent Secretary from Cambridge .
 ( CHATTER )
 For a college on the edge of bankruptcy , not a bad dinner !
 The Fitzwalter Dinner is paid for by endowment , a great 16th- century benefactor .
 Most nights we eat Mother 's Pride and processed cheese .
 You need a 20th- century benefactor .
 - Interesting you should say that .
 - Why ? Benefactors are few and far between .
 Isaac Wolfson is only the second man to have a college named after him
 - at Oxford and Cambridge .
 - Who 's the first ?
 Jesus .
 - Jesus ?
 - Jesus ...
 Christ .
 Some of our most revered benefactors are men who saved the college from the depredations of Government .
 Their names are remembered and hallowed for centuries .
 - It 's a sort of immortality .
 - Really ?
 What did these benefactors do ?
 Take Sir William de Vere , his coat of arms are there and in chapel .
 He diverted the baronial army away from Baillie in the 15th century .
 He had the soldiers billetted at St George 's College .
 - I didn 't know there was a St George 's .
 - There isn 't . Not since that .
 Then , there 's George Monkton , whom Monkton Quad 's named after .
 He stopped Cromwell melting all the college silver down to pay for his army .
 He told them the silver was better quality at Trinity , Cambridge !
 Now , it looks like there 'll be no college left to remember .
 Unless we can solve the problem of overseas students .
 ( MURMURS OF AGREEMENT )
 Well , of course , one would like to ... ... help oneself .
 Er ... help one 's friends .
 Help the college .
 - Nothing to do with the honour .
 - Of course not !
 Ignoble thought . The Minister believes it 's a politician 's duty to help others .
 ( SLURRlNG ) Absolutely .
 Name of the game . That 's why we go into politics , to help others .
 I 'm an idealist , nothing to do with the honour .
 Most of the honour comes after you 're dead .
 Not much satisfaction from having your name on the silver sconce when you 're six feet under !
 Incidentally , Master , to change the subject completely ... ... when do you award your honorary doctorates ?
 The ceremony 's not for a few months , but we have to decide in two weeks .
 - Doctorate ?
 - Aren 't they decided ? There is one Doctorate of Law still to be decided .
 We 're wondering whether it should go to a judge or someone in Government .
 ( SLURS ) Judge ? !
 You don 't want to make a judge a Doctor of Law !
 The politicians make the laws and pass the laws .
 If it wasn 't for politicians , the judges wouldn 't be able to judge .
 There 'd be no laws to judge !
 - Yes , indeed .
 Queues of unemployed judges ... ... in silly wigs ! - Quite ! They 'd have nothing to do .


 It 's all right for judges .
 They don 't have to suck up to TV producers , lie to journalists .
 They don 't have to pretend to like their Cabinet colleagues .
 I 'll tell you something else ... ... if judges had to put up with some of my colleagues , they 'd bring capital punishment back tomorrow !
 Bloody good job , too !
 I 'll tell you another thing ... ... I can 't send him to prison .
 Can 't send him to prison .
 If I were a judge , I could whiz old Humpy off to the Scrubs .
 Feet wouldn 't touch .
 Clang bang !
 See you in three years .
 One third remission for good conduct .
 I can 't do that !
 I have to listen to him .
 Oh , God !
 On and on and on !
 Some of his sentences are longer than Judge Jeffreys ' !
 No , no , no . Politicians are much more deserving .
 You don 't want to give your doctory honourates to judges .
 Definitely not ! Beautifully argued , Minister .
 I see now ... we shouldn 't give it to a judge .
 - You put the case most expertly .
 - Almost like a Doctor of Law .
 I can see you there now in the Sheldonian , standing there in those magnificent crimson robes , receiving your doctorate in front of an assembly of eminent scholars .
 ( HUMPHREY ) Wonderful .
 ( MASTER ) Marvellous . How funny you should say that .
 I was just thinking the same thing .

 Morning , Minister .
 Morning , Bernard . Most enjoyable dinner last night .
 I wonder if we could have a private chat .
 Forgive us , Bernard .
 Minister ... ... the master of Baillie has asked me to enquire whether you 'd accept an honorary doctorate of law .
 Me ?
 Good heavens !
 - It 's ... not an offer .
 - No , of course not . Of course , in view of your well- known hostility to honours ...
 Don 't be silly .
 This is quite different .
 Not entirely , Minister .
 It 's a matter of accepting it without doing anything to deserve it , as you might put it in your refreshingly blunt fashion .
 I 'm a Cabinet Minister ! - Isn 't that what you 're paid for ?

 - Yes , but ...
 No !
 Yes , but ...
 I can 't refuse a vote of confidence in the Government , not just oneself .
 No , quite .
 As I say , it 's not certain , it 's ...
 ( HUMPHREY HUMS TO HlMSELF )
 Humphrey , to change the subject completely ,
 I 'd like to do what I can for Baillie in this overseas students business .
 Oh , good !
 But wouldn 't I need a pretext ... a reason ?
 No , Minister , no problem . The Palace has been under pressure from certain African leaders .
 We can 't embarrass the Palace , so we 'll redesignate Baillie as a Commonwealth Education Centre .
 But where am I to find the money ?
 I 'm set on 5 % cuts across the board . If that 's achieved , anything 's possible .
 - The committee are waiting .
 - Very well , show them in .
 I suppose we could achieve the cuts in this department , if the absurd idea of linking honours to cuts were to be shelved .
 - I see .
 - Yes ...
 ( HUMPHREY ) Thank you , Bernard .
 ( HACKER ) Morning . Now , minutes of the previous meeting ?
 Matters arising :
 Accommodation .
 Oh , yes !
 I 'm happy to be able to tell you that we have found a 5 % cut , by selling an office in High Wycombe .
 - Oh , really ?
 - Yes .
 - Yes , very good .
 - Yes .
 Stationery acquisition ? We 've discovered a new stock control system to reduce expenditure .

 - By how much ?
 - About 5 % , wasn 't it ?
 Excellent !
 Parks and Forestry ? If we delay the new computers , we can make a saving .

 - By how much ?
 - Yes ... ?
 - About 5 % .
 - Yes , about 5 % .
 - Really ? - That cuts data processing , too .


 - By ... ?
 - By ...
 By about 5 % . - This is most satisfying .

 - Yes .
 Incidentally , while I think of it , have you finished with the list for the honours secretary ?
 Yes , Humphrey .
 No problem there .
 Bernard will give it to you .
 - Thank you , Bernard .
 - All right , Humphrey ? Yes , Doctor ... er , Minister . http : // episode- heaven . rt . hu
