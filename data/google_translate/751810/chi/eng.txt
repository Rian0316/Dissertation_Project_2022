 00 : 00 : 47, 267 -- > 00 : 00 : 50, 226 What time is the Minister recording this broadcast ?


 Two p . m . , Sir Humphrey .
 Can 't you stop him referring to the Solihull project ?
 - There 's not a hope .
 - Oh , God .
 " It 's a shining example of collaboration between government and industry " .
 - How could he think that ?
 - You told him itwas .
 Can a 74 million building project in the middle of a city , be swept underthe carpet ?
 - We 'll use the Official Secrets - A secret ?
 It 's so huge . It 's a big secret , Bernard .
 But you can 't use the Official Secrets Act with something everybody knows about ?
 The Official Secrets Act is not to protect secrets , but officials .
 Why haven 't you allowed me to show the Solihull Report to the Minister , tell him the truth ?
 He hasn 't asked .
 Why bothera Minister ifhe doesn 'twant to know ?
 But how could he ask ifhe doesn 't know ?
 Quite so .
 It 's not that I 'm questioning yourjudgement but ...
 - But ?
 - But why ?
 Because , Bernard , the Solihull Report contained a paragraph casting doubt on the financial soundness of Michael Bradley and Sloane Enterprises Ltd .
 And the report 's foresight had some insight in the light ofhindsight ?
 What ?
 If it said that Michael Bradley was going to go bust ?
 Please , Bernard , watch your language .
 The point is that , by the time the Report came out , I was so ... orratherthe Department was so committed to Bradley that it seemed worth taking the risk to see the project through .
 If the Ministerknows this partnerwas going bust , he wouldn 't make a broadcast about it .
 Ministers should neverknow more than they need to know .
 Then they can 't tell anyone .
 Like secret agents .
 They could be captured and tortured .
 By terrorists ?
 By the BBC , Bernard .
 The bank doesn 't know whetherornot to foreclose .
 I 'll dine with Sir Desmond Glazebrook , theirChairman .
 We might manage to cook something up .
 Why don 't you go to a restaurant ?
 Anyway , in the meantime , come what may , the Ministermust not refer to the Solihull Project on the air .
 Sir Humphrey , this is a bit of a coverup , isn 't it ?
 Certainly not .
 It is responsible discretion exercised in the national interest to prevent unnecessary disclosure of eminently justifiable procedures in which untimely revelation could severely impairpublic confidence .


 Oh , I see .
 It 's like Watergate ?
 Bernard !
 If you wish to leave the Service and become a BBC interviewer ,
 - you have only to apply .
 - I 'm sorry , but ...
 Howwas Watergate different exactly ?
 Watergate happened in America , Bernard !
 Oh yes , yes .
 I see .
 - Good morning , Minister .
 - Good morning . Morning , Bernard .
 Sorry I 'm late . Put them on the desk , George .
 I don 'twant to be late at Broadcasting House .
 What 's the broadcast all about ?
 NATO , wasn 't it ? No , partherships in industry .
 Oh , yes .
 I knew itwas something like that .
 - Who else is in it ?
 - It 's all in there . An Employer and a Trades Unionist .

 Joe Morgan ?
 Wasn 't he the TUC representative on the Solihull project ?
 Er , Minister ...

 Yes , Humphrey ?
 You are not proposing to refer to the Solihull project on the air ?
 Yes .
 It 's a shining example of cooperation between the Government and industry .
 But I would be much happier if itwere omitted .
 Why ?
 Don 't you think it 's ratherpremature ?
 Certainly not .
 Building started months ago . Exactly . Ratherout of date , in fact .

 Premature and out of date ?
 Well , untimely .
 Would it be uninteresting to the general public ?
 No .
 It 's something that 's going on . - Extremely interesting .

 - Yes . Quite so .
 So interesting that there is a danger that it might obscure yourmain point , perhaps .
 What is my main point ?

 Bernard , what 's the Minister 's main point ?
 Private projects are more socially responsible with government money , and government projects are more efficientwith private investment .
 You see ?
 It underlines my main point . You really are a wet blanket .
 Just go about stirring up apathy .
 Minister , I must seriously advise you with all the earnestness at my command , not to referto the Solihull Project on the air .

 Why ?
 - What ?
 - I said , why ?
 - Why ?
 - Why ?
 Well , Minister ...
 Are you planning to take the credit forthis yourself ?
 At the European Convention of Government administration .
 Yourspeech will make very good reading .
 Well , a fewfacts of life .
 Politicians are responsible ultimately to the people , and we get the credit .
 Not Civil Servants . I would be happyforyou to have the " credit " forthis project .
 But , I must beg , beseech and implore you not today .
 No , it 's no good . I 'm not going to fall for it .
 I 'm going to get all the political capital of this .
 I know a good thing when I see one .
 - Please , do listen to ...
 - No . No . No .
 - Minister , p ...
 - No , Humpy .

 - What ?
 - What ?
 If it had been up to me , I 'd help out like a shot .
 Quite so .
 It 's not the bank 's fault if some idiot Minister gets into bed with a kid , who runs with the money .
 That Ministerwasn 't entirely to blame .
 There were extenuating circumstances .
 This Bradley chap looked very sound at the time .
 But you wouldn 't have done a damn fool thing like that .
 Would you ?
 When it looked like Bradley wanted a loan thatwas one thing .
 But nowhe can 't pay his bills .
 Well , he is unlikely to fulfil his financial undertakings to Her Majesty 's Government .
 Can 't pay his bills , you mean . And Her Majesty 's Government 's undertakings go down with him .
 Yes .
 Unless a reputable bank were to take overthe contract from Bradley with a view to participating in a project which Her Majesty 's Government is determined to make profitable .

 Quite so .
 More Sancerre for Her Majesty 's Government ?
 Well , like I say , it 's up to my Board .
 Could go eitherway , quite frankly .
 - Could go eitherway .
 - I see .
 Incidentally , to change the subject completely , you rememberthe new Ministry Copartnership
 Commission you mentioned ?
 Indeed .
 The Chairmanship hasn 't been filled yet ?

 - Not yet , Desmond .
 - Because if itwere to be ... should one be offered ... not forthe money , I mean , what 's 8, 000 a year ?
 160 a week .
 Part time .
 Quite .
 But itwould be a fascinating ...
 Has anything been decided , informally ?
 You 're looking around fora couple of quangos , and I can tell you , in complete confidence , that yourname is on the shortlist .


 On the shortlist ?
 Quangos can 't suddenly be in short supply , can they ?
 There 's report in today 's Telegraph .
 " The Quango Jungle :
 There are still around 8, 000 paid appointments within the gift of Ministers to Quasi Autonomous NGOs ,
 - at five million pounds a year " .
 - You 'll have two orthree spare .
 There 's certainly a lot of them around , the point is finding one that is appropriate .
 There has to be some reason to appoint you .

 What about the Advisory Committee of Dental Establishments ?
 - Know anything about teeth ?
 - I 'm a banker .
 And that rules out the Milk Marketing Board , too .
 Right . How about the Dumping at Sea Representations Panel ?
 - Do you live nearthe sea ?
 - Knightsbridge .
 Just behind Harrods .
 Not nearenough .
 That more or less rules out the Clyde River Purification Board too .
 - Rump steak ?
 - That 's forme .
 Meat Marketing Board .
 Know anything about meat ?
 I eat it . Not enough .
 It rules out the Meat and Liverstock Commission .
 - Doversole .
 Sir ?
 - White Fish Authority ?
 Potatoes ?
 Potato Marketing Board ?
 The Governors of the National Vegetable Research Station ?
 The National Biological Standards Board ?
 Is that my salad .
 Thank you , Robert .
 The Arable Crops and Forage Board ?
 The Food and Drink Training Board ?
 Some French mustard , please ?
 What about the Food Additives and Contaminants committee ?
 I know very little about any of those .
 - Well , what do you know about ?
 - Nothing . Nothing really .
 I 'm a banker .
 This is not easy .

 The Fire Services Examinations Board ?


 St. John 's Ambulance ?
 - French mustard , sir .
 - Thank you .
 What about the Plant Varieties and Seeds Tribunal ?
 Dammit , Humphrey , I 'm a banker .
 Thank you .
 There must be some minority group that you can represent .
 Bankers .
 You see , the ideal quango appointee is a black , Welsh , disabled woman Trade Unionist .
 We 're all looking around forone of them .
 - You don 't happen to know any ?
 - No .
 No .
 Well ... It all boils down to the Industry Copartnership Commission .
 I 'd find that quite acceptable .
 Well , it is within the gift of my Minister .
 And you need only put in appearances twice a month .
 Lots of papers ?
 Yes , but itwouldn 't be awfully necessary to read them .
 I wouldn 't have anything to say at the meetings .
 Splendid . You 're just the chap I 'm looking for .
 Broadcasting House , please .
 Sorry to keep you , George .
 When you drop me , please take Mr. Wooly on to the House .
 Why Humphrey wants to stop me mentioning the Solihull Project on the air ?
 Didn 't you think he gave 6 or 7 convincing reasons ?
 No .
 Did you ? I think he knows what he 's doing .
 Sure he does .
 I only wish I knew what he was doing .
 I 'm sure if Sir Humphrey advises something , then , whateverhe does advise is advisable .
 - What do you advise ?
 - It 's not forme to advise , but I would advise you that you would be well advised to follow Sir Humphrey 's advice .
 Why ?
 Well , it 's just that ... certain projects have certain aspects which , with sensitive handling , given reasonable discretion , when events permit , there is no prima facie reason why , with appropriate give and take , if if all goes well , in the fullness of time , when the moment is ripe , er ...



 You 're blathering .
 - Yes , Minister .
 - Why are you blathering ?
 It 's my job , Minister .
 An example of this is going on up in Solihull now .
 Government money and private investment working together in a real partnership .
 Claptrap . And it 's symbolic of the way this Government is working .

 I 've taken a personal interest in the Solihull Project because ...
 Not justwords , it is actually there in bricks and mortar .
 A concrete example , if I may put it like that , of the fact that ourprinciples really work .
 Thank you , Minister .
 One lastword , Mr. Conway ?
 There 's nothing wrong with the principle of partnership ...
 Provided that there 's no interference in management decisions from the State orthe workforce .
 Thank you , Mr. Conway .
 Joe Morgan ? Dear , oh dear , oh dear .
 We all know that Mr. Conway is talking out of date capitalist claptrap .
 If partnership is to mean anything , it must mean an equal partnership between unions , government and industry .
 - In that order .
 - Afinal word , Minister ? - There 's no need to be offensive .
 - Gentlemen , please . We 're all in agreement .
 We 've shown that if we can work together we can forge a new Britain .
 And it 's a pleasure to talk to two of the principal forgers ... principal participants .
 Thank you .
 James Hacker , Minister forAdministrative Affairs , was talking with George Conway , from the Construction Federation , and Joe Morgan , from the Commercial and Administrative Workers Union .

 Splendid .
 Thank you all .
 Jean will take you to Hospitality . - Was it really all right ?
 - First class .
 Most interesting , Minister .

 Can we edit that awful Hacker waffle down to two and a half ?
 Leave the Solihull bit .
 - Joe , see you later .
 - Yes , George . I hope you won 't mind my mentioning it ,

 Mr. Harker , but could you put a word in formy members ' claim for a special Birmingham allowance ?
 I don 't think I can conduct Trade Union negotiations in a BBC studio .
 And that 's a matter forthe Employment ...
 - But a word from you ...
 - No , I 'm sorry . We 'd have a Manchesterallowance , Plymouth allowance ,
 Chipping Sodbury allowance ...
 Afterthis broadcast people might ask about the Solihull project , wanting to knowmore about it .
 I hope they do . But as we know , there are some things betternot found out .
 I 'm sure we understand one another .

 Do we ?
 Something in youreye ?
 - Just a gleam .
 - What ? Oh , come off it , Hacker .
 We 've got you by the short and curlies .
 And I 'm asking 10 % below London allowance , and we 'll settle for 30 % below .
 Give you the credit forbeating us down .
 No allowance . You 'd better resign youself to that .
 I 'm not the one who will have to resign .
 - What are you talking about ?
 - The Solihull Project . I could hardly believe you took all the credit for it .

 Great courage , of course , but whateverpossessed you ?
 " Cannons to the right ofhim , Cannons to the left ofhim ,
 Into the Valley of death rode Mr. Hacker " .

 How did it go , sir ?
 Oh , very well .
 Very well . I was talking about government industry cooperation .
 There 's a very interesting project in the Midlands .
 I don 't suppose you 'd have heard about it , but it 's very interesting if you know the background .
 You don 't mean the Solihull Project , sir ?
 Yes .
 You have heard about it .
 - What are you laughing about ?
 - Nothing , sir .
 - What have you heard ?
 - Nothing really , sir .
 It 's a shining example of collaboration between government and industry .

 What do you know about all this ?
 37 journeys between the Ministry and Mr. Michael Bradley 's office , 44 Farringdon Street , and 129 Birmingham Road , Solihull .

 37 journeys ?
 Who with ? Yourpredecessor , sir , and Sir Humphrey , mostly .
 Very cheerful they were , on the first few trips .
 They kept talking about shining examples of successful collaboration and such like .
 Then the gloom started to come down .
 - Gloom ?
 - Well , no not gloom .
 More like desperation , really .
 Desperation ?
 What about ? You know the background , sir .
 Well , yes , yes ...
 Any bit of the background you were thinking of ?
 No .
 When something 's fishy , it 's just fishy , isn 't it ?
 You don 't knowwhich bit the smell 's coming from .
 - Fishy ? - Well , I don 't really know .
 Forall I know , Mr. Bradley may be quite kosher , despite everything Sir Humphrey said about him .
 You knowmore about all that than I do .
 I 'm just the driver .
 Quite .
 Quite . I 'm just the Minister .
 An allowance for Morgan 's union is out of the question .
 But howwas the broadcast ?
 Well , all right , I think .
 You think ?
 I talked about the Solihull Project .
 And then I had second thoughts .
 Any particularreason ?
 No ...
 Humphrey , is everything all right about the Solihull Project ?
 Yes , Minister . The building works proceed satisfactorily .
 No , no , no , that 's not what I meant .
 - Is something going on ?
 - Building is going on .
 No , no , Humphrey .
 Something 's up , isn 't it ?
 - Yes indeed , Minister .
 - What ? The 1st floor is up , and the 2nd flooralmost up .
 I 'm talking about the whole basis of the thing .
 Oh , I see . - What can you tell me about ?
 - As I understand it ...
 The basis is an aggregate of gravel and cement on six feet ofbest builders rubble .
 You know I am talking about the finance .
 Ourcontractwith the construction company you mean ?
 The stage payments are in accordance with all the usual ...
 Humphrey !
 What is it that I don 't know ? - What precisely do you mean ?
 - I don 't know .
 That 's just it , I don 't know because I can 't find what questions to ask you , and I don 't knowwhat to ask you because I don 't know .
 What is it that I don 't know ?
 Minister , I don 't know what you don 't know .
 It could be almost anything .
 - Your 're keeping something from me .
 - Yes indeed .
 It is the Department 's duty to protect the Minister from the great tide of irrelevant information that beats against the walls of this Department .
 There is something about the Solihull Project that I know I don 't know and I know you know .
 I know Bernard knows .
 Joe Morgan knows . My own driverknows more than I do .
 Only poorJoe Soap who has to tell the public about it hasn 't got a clue as to what 's going on .

 Will you answer a simple question ?
 Certainly , Minister .
 What is it ? I don 't know !
 If you tell me , I 'll ask it !
 Well ...
 - Yes , Frank ?
 - Ourmeeting . - About my quango paper .

 - Come on in . - You 've read Frank 's paper ?
 - Yes indeed , Minister . What did you think about ending the ministerial patronage ?
 All those thousands of jobs forthe boys .
 Most original and imaginative .
 You liked it ?
 Those are two of Humphrey 's most damning criticisms .
 Itwould be a very popular political move .
 Hand the quango appointments overto Parliament .
 The best men forthe job instead of old chums , partyhacks .
 It should be legislated .
 - It is a novel proposal ...
 - That 's the otherkiller .
 But when a system is working smoothly ...
 Smoothly ! Look at this !
 Proposal forChairman of the new Industrial Coparthership Commission ,
 Sir Desmond Glazebrook , I ask you !
 He 's neverbeen in industry , and he 's said unpleasant things about this government .
 Is that a smoothly operating system ?
 - He would be an excellent ...
 - He 's a blithering idiot ! - Yes , but an excellent Chairman .
 - I 'm sorry , Humphrey . I am not going to appoint Sir Desmond Glazebrook .

 - Minister , you must .
 - No , no , no ... - Please , Minister ...
 - No way .
 No Glazebrook .
 Overmy dead body .
 Right ? Minister , before you make yourfinal decision
 I think perhaps you ought to see this .
 " Report on the Solihull Project " .
 Why is it top secret ?
 " 7 . 5 million pounds ... probably bankrupt proceedings ... inminent collapse of project " ... well ...

 Imminent collapse of project !
 Why didn 't you tell me ?
 I am conscious of the heavy burdens of youroffice .
 But this 'll be all overthe front pages .
 It 's a public scandal , a disaster .
 It 's ...
 - It 's appalling ...
 - Jim . It is dated before the election .
 You 're in the clear .
 Yes , but unfortunately underthe convention of Ministerial responsability , the blame must fall ...
 - Everyone will know itwasn 't Jim .
 - Quite so .
 The principle of democratic accountability requires the occasional human sacrifice .
 When the pack is baying forblood ...
 - Isn 't that right ?
 - He 'll point to the dates ... Oh , a lesserman might try to wriggle out of it .
 But there is only one honourable course open .
 As the Minister is well aware .
 Frank might have a point ?
 Only today you have publicly identified yourself with the success of the project .
 The broadcast !
 When 's it going out ?
 It 's due fortransmission about now .
 Get on to the BBC at once . - Stop it !
 - Stop what ?
 Oh yes ... I wish you luck but you know what the BBC are like .
 This is a crisis , this is a scandal ...
 If you were to put it like that , they might ...
 - Might what ? - Move it to peak listening time .

 Any luck ?
 Aperfect example of what can be done is going on up in Solihull .
 Government money and private investment in real partnership to me , symbolic of everything this Government is working for .
 I 've taken a great personal interest in the Solihull project .
 It 's not just words , it 's actually there in bricks and mortar ...
 " Symbolic of everything this Government is working for " .
 How could you let me say all those things ?
 Minister , I can only advise .
 I did advise .
 I advised most strongly . But when the adviser 's advice is unheeded ...
 All right , all right .
 Advise me now .
 Certainly , Minister .
 It is possible that the bank may take over the contract from Bradley and Sloane Enterprises Ltd .
 And all will be well . - The bank !
 Fine !
 Well ... - The bank , however , is hesitant .
 But it so happens that the Director in charge is to retire next year and he 's anxious to find anotherappointment ... a chairmanship of a quango , for instance .

 Give him one !
 Give him that one you were reserving forthat idiot
 Sir Desmond Glazebrook .
 Who is the Director ?
 Desmond Glazebrook .
 He 's not a bad chap , really .
 He 's always attacking the government .
 It does us good sometimes to appoint ouropponents .
 It 's democratic , statesmanlike .
 Yes , that 's a very good appointment .
 - But you can 't .
 - Do shut up , Frank !
 Anybody else know about this ?
 Apart from ourselves and the bank and Michael Bradley , the Union representative .
 Joe Morgan !
 Of course . That 's whatwas behind his special Birmingham allowance claim .
 - Blackmail .
 - Quite so , Minister . Humphrey , I 've been thinking .
 Desmond Glazebrook will need some support .
 A Deputy Chairman , someone with real experience of Industry .
 An excellent thought .
 Is there anyone you could advise me would be appropriate ?
 ATrade Unionist , forexample ?
 What about Joe Morgan , Minister ?
 Joe Morgan !
 What an excellent idea .
 Well done . It takes two to quango , Minister .
 Get on to them both immediately .
 This is what 's wrong with the system !
 It 's jobs forthe boys , quid pro quo corruption .
 What about my quango abolition paper ?
 Very good , Frank . Original and imaginative .

 - Novel .
 - Novel .

 I 'm serious about it .
 What are you going to do ?
 You 're not going to suppress it .
 I 'll get it adopted as party policy .
 If the Press were to get hold of this ...
 Yes , if the Press were to get hold of this .
 - What a story !
 - Frank , I 've been wondering .
 Have you everthought of serving on a quango ?
 You 're not corrupting me .
 No , no , of course not .
 But perhaps betterthan abolishing the entire system would be to make itwork .
 Humphrey and I were thinking , if we were to set up a special commission to investigate and report on the composition and activities of all quangos , that might be the answer .


 The answer !
 Itwould have to be very senior , mostly Privy Councillors .
 But itwould need too some very able people who have studied quangos and knew the abuses of the system .
 And in the light of yourknowledge and concern ,
 Humphrey suggested yourname .
 - Didn 't you , Humphrey ?
 - Mr. Weisel , I said . You 're not going to change my opinions .
 - There is such a thing as integrity .
 - Of course .
 Youropinions and your integrity would make you such a valuable member of this quango .
 Mind you , itwould be very hard work .
 Service to this SuperQuango would involve you in some very arduous foreign travel , to see how these matters are managed in other important government centres .

 Japan , Australia ,
 California , the West Indies ...
 - Tahiti ...
 - Tahiti .
 Yes , thatwould be fairly arduous .
 Dreadful .
 Dreadful .
 But serving the public 's what it 's all about , isn 't it ?
 - Absolutely ...
 - Serving the public .
 Serving the public .

 And my quango paper ?
 Invaluable , take itwith you .
 I 'll keep a copy , if I may , on the files .
 With the Solihull Report .
 Yes , Minister .
