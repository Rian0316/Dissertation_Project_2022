 Eerie but awesome look- alikes
 ( spits )


 ( cheering )



 We agree there 's no sense in having a baby until we 've seen all five doppelgangers , right ?
 Yeah , of course .
 Stands to reason .
 Okay , so , when we finally see Barney 's doppelganger , that 's the universe telling us it 's go time .
 And that 's when we 'll start trying . Deal ?
 Deal .

 Baby , were we serious about the whole Fifth Doppelganger thing ?
 I mean , having a baby is a pretty big thing to leave up to the universe .
 Yeah , I know it 's crazy .
 It 's just so much easier to let the universe decide .
 Why do you ask ?
 Boom !
 Universed !
 Oh , my God ! Wait , wait , wait , hold on .
 That could easily be Barney pulling some scam to meet chicks .
 I 'm one step ahead of you .
 Go for Barney .
 Barney , hey .
 It 's Marshall .
 So you are at work ?
 You 're not -- I don 't know -- driving a cab , wearing a wig .
 Yes , I 'm at work .
 That 's the sound of my stapler .
 That 's the sound of my three- hole punch .
 And this is the sound of me filing my corporate guidelines on sexual harassment . ( shredder buzzes )
 What is up ? !
 Got to go , Big Chief .
 Barney 's at work .
 That- that was The Fifth Doppelganger .
 Marshall Eriksen ... put a baby in my belly .
 I can 't wait to tell the gang .
 This is one of those moments you dream about .
 " Guys ...
 " Lily and I ... are having unprotected sex . "
 Ooh , I just got the chills .
 We 're not gonna say anything .
 What ?
 Why ?
 Marshall , if we tell them , we 're basically inviting them into the most private , intimate moment of our lives .
 You guys banging ? ( Marshall and Lily scream )
 Keep going ; I 'm not even here .
 But just for the record , having a baby : huge mistake .
 Now , show me what you got .
 Uncle Teddy 's here ! ( Marshall and Lily scream )
 Quick question :
 How you guys gonna handle the whole Santa thing ?
 I 'm thinking , just be honest .
 ( chuckles ) :
 Ah , hell . I 'll dress up .
 This just in ... ( Marshall and Lily scream ) is what Marshall Eriksen is about to say to his wife as he attempts to impregnate her .
 Chopper 12 is live on the scene with " Baby Watch :
 2010 . "
 ( helicopter hovering ) ( wind blustering )
 Okay , fine .
 I won 't tell anybody about the baby thing .
 Hey , guys .
 Hey .
 Guys ...
 We saw The Fifth Doppelganger !
 ( gasps ) Whoa !
 Amazing ! That is awesome !
 Mm- hmm .
 Ooh , freaky .
 A brunette Barney .
 I know .
 Say what you will about the guy , but Barney seems right as a blond . Well , that 's true .
 Not every dude can pull that off the blond look .
 I don 't know about that .
 What ?
 Oh , that summer I was lifeguarding at the Chagrin Falls Country Club ,
 I was lathering a little lemon juice into the old mop , playing with some natural highlights .
 Let 's just say there were a few senior citizens who pretended to drown on my watch .
 And sadly , one who did .
 Anyway , I 'd look good blond .




 TED :
 What are we all thinking about ?


 A bunch of people emphatically MARSHALL :


 Yes , we 'd all like some nachos .
 I love you , buddy , but there 's absolutely no way that you could pull off blond .
 It- it just wouldn 't look right .
 Yeah , seriously , Ted , don 't go blond .
 ( bangs table ) I 'm going blond !
 No !
 No !
 That is not the outcome we were hoping for !


 So , that 's why Monty and I vow never to do drugs .
 Because drugs are bad .
 Right , Monty ?
 We , sure , man- made chemical stuff .
 But things that grow in nature -- they 're okay to try , like , once or twice .
 Not looking for gray areas here , Monty .
 I don 't think it 's right to lie to the kids , Moo- Moo .
 So ... what are you saying ?
 I 've experimented with drugs . ( gasps )
 Mmm .
 Hmm , what was that for ?
 Before I met you , I 'd given up on everything .
 Relationships , career , pants . ( both chuckle )
 But you made me want to try again .
 I love you for that . Oh .
 Huh ?
 Ooh .
 ( chuckles )
 Oh , I see .
 Mmm .
 ( chuckles )
 Hi .
 Hey , hi .
 Sorry .
 Um , you don 't know me , but I just wanted to say thank you .
 You 're actually a very important person in my life .
 Important ?
 More like legendary .
 Marshall , it 's me !
 Barney !


 Wow , this is just very sudden .
 Sure , I can get you an answer by tomorrow .
 Okay .
 Thanks .
 ( sighs softly )
 Ted , something big has just happened , and you 're the most sensible person I know .
 I need to talk to you right now .
 You know what , it can wait .
 No , go ahead .
 I 'm listening .
 Okay , well , the executive producer from WNKW happened to see our show the other morning and loved me .
 They offered me the lead anchor job , starting next week .
 Wow , that 's great !
 It is great .
 But , um , here 's the catch .
 WNKW is in ... ( dryer whirring )
 H- Helen , kill the dryer !
 ( dryer stops )
 Is in Chicago .
 But you were The Fifth Doppelganger .
 How- how can you be you ?
 I called you , Barney ; We had a whole conversation !
 Ah , yes , I know what happened .
 See , people at work have this very strange expectation that I , well , work . ( scoffs )
 I know , I know .


 What is up ? !
 Got to go , Big Chief .
 How can it be a recording ?
 You called me Big Chief , my special workplace nickname .
 Oh , buddy .
 ( exhales forcefully )
 Hey , hey .
 Come on , Big Chief .
 Don 't .
 Just don 't .
 Why does this have to happen now ?
 I mean , just when things are going so great with Don . ( sighs ) It 's the never- ending battle of my life :
 Career versus romance .
 ( laughs ) :
 " Never- ending battle " ?
 Career has been trouncing romance for years .
 It 's like the Globetrotters versus the Generals .
 Career 's sinking hook shots from half court ,
 Romance is just a bunch of slow white guys who couldn 't make it in the Italian league .
 ( sighs )
 Ted , I 'm lost .
 What should I do ?
 Okay , you seriously need to talk to Don about this .
 I 'm just too confused to put this on Don .
 I need to leave him out of it until I figure out what I want . That makes sense .
 Yeah .
 And I 'm sorry I can 't give you better advice on this .
 The truth is , it 's impossible for me to be objective about you moving away .
 Mm .
 Did you get a manicure ?
 No , I didn 't get a ...
 He sure did .
 Flo !
 Why are you brunette and driving a cab ? Oh , that .
 You know how it 's my dream to have sex with at least one woman from every country on the planet ?
 Sure . Wow .

 You 're doing surprisingly well in the Baltics . Mm- hmm .
 So , I figure , what 's the quickest way to get around the world in 180 lays ?
 Lease a cab and wait outside the U. N. building for hot foreign chicks .

 Chicks don 't want to bang cab drivers .
 Chicks do not want to bang cab drivers !
 And I put a lot of work into this one . I can 't believe this .
 Now I got to tell Lily The Fifth Doppelganger is a fake .
 So ?
 What does she care ?
 Lily decided that once we spotted your doppelganger , we 'd start trying to have kids .
 Kids ? !
 No !
 Uh- uh !
 The rule is : no kids until you 're at least 45 !
 Do you ever read my blog ? !
 It 's gotten a lot better .
 I 'm ready to be a dad , you know ?
 But Lily needs some sign from the universe .
 And now it could be years . I 'm sorry , buddy .
 That 'll be $37 . 50 .


 The universe has spoken .
 Marshall Eriksen , let 's make a baby .
 I ...
 Okay .
 ( both moaning )
 Hey .
 Hey .
 ( laughing hysterically )
 Hang on , hang on , hang on .
 I heard you were doing this , so I worked on some stuff .
 Uh , hey , uh , I 'm planning a " White Wedding . "
 Tell me , Billy Idol , is it a nice day for that ?
 ( chuckles )
 Some other Billy Idol ones .
 Um , if anyone 's looking for the real Slim Shady , he 's right here . That one 's only okay .
 Robin , why aren 't you getting in on this ?
 Okay , first of all , I 'm getting tons of compliments .
 Second of all , tell him .
 He 's not getting tons of compliments .
 No , the other thing . ROBlN :
 Oh .
 I might move to Chicago next week .
 Mm , um , hey , baby . Hmm ?
 Not for nothing or nothing , but we 'd still be doing this even if we hadn 't seen Doppelganger Barney , right ?
 Ooh , but we did see him , which means the universe -- in all its infinite wisdom -- is telling you to stick me and stick me real good .
 I can 't .
 I can 't in good conscience stick you .
 ( sighs ) I know what 's bothering you .
 Really ?
 The cabbages didn 't look enough like Barney .
 Well , that 's just not true . No !
 Time- out !
 This is a group decision !
 You can 't just move to Chicago unless we all say it 's okay .
 Barney , I think this has to be Robin 's ...
 Stay out of this , Brigitte Nielsen
 We need Marshall and Lily .
 That cabbie was like a foot shorter than Barney !
 He was the exact same size !
 And you know what ?
 I think he was Asian .
 Yeah , that guy was like a tiny , graying Asian man
 Wl- with a soul patch and a potbelly .
 Have you completely forgotten what Barney looks like ? ! You guys banging ?
 ( Marshall and Lily scream )
 Why are you in our bedroom ? ( both scream )

 ( both scream ) Why is Ellen DeGeneres in our bedroom ?
 ( both chuckling ) Hey , this is working !
 Wait a minute .
 Candles ...
 Flowers ...
 Oh , I guess Marshall " forgot " to tell you .
 The Fifth Doppelganger ... was me .
 What ?
 Wait , and you knew about this ?
 You lied to me ?
 By omission , and it 's only because this whole " leave it to the universe " thing of yours is insane , Lily .
 Baby , you ... Lily , we need to be in control of our own ...
 Guys , guys !
 We 're forgetting what 's really important here .
 Ted 's blond . ( all chuckling )
 Guys , I am pulling this off .
 Now , Robin has something important to tell you .
 He 's not pulling it off .
 No , the other thing .
 He got a manicure .
 The other thing .
 I got a job offer in Chicago .
 Whoa .
 That 's why we all came down here -- to try and talk Robin out of making a huge ...
 Actually , I- I 've , I 've already made a decision .
 ( sighs ) Guys , I gotta take it .
 I can 't believe we 're losing Robin .



 Oh , and by the way , this was a huge mistake .
 I 'm changing my hair back . Smart .

 Told ya .
 Not at all awesome .
 Hey .
 Hey .
 Hey . So , I just got off the phone with Chicago .
 Yes , I have made a decision .
 Um ...
 I appreciate the offer , but I can 't take the job .
 Thanks .
 I 'm staying .
 Damn straight ! Yay !
 ( all exclaiming )
 Robin !
 Hey , Lily , tell me something .
 When you saw actual Barney driving that cab , and you thought he was a petite , potbellied Asian man ?
 I know .
 Weird , right ?
 It 's not weird .
 It means you 're not ready .
 And I 'm ...
 I 'm sorry that I tried to rush things .
 Our baby can wait for the real Doppelganger Barney .
 Oh ...
 Mm .
 Mm .
 ( mimics Monty ) :
 Hey , Moo- Moo . Monty made you thin- crust pizza just the way you like it !

 Hi .
 Mmm ...
 You okay ?
 Robin , you 're not gonna believe this .
 I got offered the lead anchor job at WNKW in Chicago .
 Oh .
 Um , what 'd you say ?
 I said yes .
 I 've been waiting years for a shot like this .
 Barney ?
 I am simple street performer from Estonia .
 ( Estonian accent ) :
 Who is this Barney ?
 Oh , he 's just this guy we know who has , like , a really lame blog .
 I hear it 's getting better .
 I mean , wha- what is " blog " ?
 It 's just something that was cool , like , eight years ago .
 Still cool .
 Still sounds pretty cool , man .
 What 's your name ?
 Kristof .
 Kristof what ?

 Kristof ...
 Doppelganger .
 Really ?
 Yep .
 You 're gonna go with the last name ( mimics accent ) :
 " Doppelganger " ?
 That 's my name , man .
 Bro ...
 Robin , wait .
 Please try to understand .
 I gotta get out of here .
 Wait . Put yourself in my shoes .
 Can you imagine what it 's like to have the phone ring , and it 's your dream job on the other end ?
 Yes ...
 I can . ( voice breaking ) :
 Good luck in Chicago , Don .
 Barney , why are you doing this ?
 ( grunts )
 Wait a minute .
 Could it , could it be that Barney Stinson actually wants us to have kids ?
 Who is this Barney ? !
 Take American chill pill !
 Well , let me tell you about him .
 He talks a big game about how no one should ever have kids before they 're at least 45 .
 I would be interested in reading some of these opinions in blog form .
 But I think I know what happened .
 Yesterday , Barney thought he had to say good- bye to someone he truly loves .
 And it got him thinking ...
 Maybe it wouldn 't be the worst thing if a baby joined our little group .
 Babies ...
 Mm .
 And someday , he 's gonna make the best uncle in the world .
 Because this Barney ...
 He 's family to us .
 ( Eastern- European accent ) : Excuse me .
 I heard you 're from Estonia .
 So am I.
 Excuse me one moment .

 And I am street performer like you .
 Ay- yi- yi- yi !
 ( knocking )
 Hey .
 Say yes to this .
 Okay . ( voice breaking ) :
 Can I move back in ?
 ( sniffling )
 Yes .
 But , Ted , am I just the biggest idiot in the world ?
 Look , think about all of us five years ago when we first met you .




 And last year , he fell in love .


 Now she 's one of my closest friends .
 And you ?
 over your career , but today you did .
 Looks like I 'm getting dumber .
 No , ( sighs ) just more courageous .
 Look , we 've all been searching for The Five Doppelgangers , right ? Mm .
 But eventually , over time , we all become our own doppelgangers .
 You know , these ... these completely different people who just happen to look like us .
 " Five Years Ago Robin " ?
 That girl , she was pretty great .
 But Doppelganger Robin ?
 She 's amazing .
 We 've , um , we 've had a lot to drink ...
 I don 't care .
 ( snickering ) What ?
 ( laughing ) Oh . Oh , yeah .
 I forgot I 'm blond .
 I have blond hair .



 Oh , my God ! Yes !
 You 're here !
 This is fantastic ! Baby , simmer .
 Your husband 's right there .

 Guys , follow me !
 Guys , look !
 The Fifth Doppelganger !
 Uh , Lily ?
 That dude looks noth ... MARSHALL :
 Guys ...
 Go with it .

 It 's uncanny .
 Right ?
 Just like Barney .
 Amazing .
 It 's like looking in the mirror .

 So , um , does this mean ... ?
 Marshall Eriksen ... put a baby in my belly .
 Mm ...
