Recap
I just saw my son in a homeless report
Oh my God !
Orson found A ndrew . . .
Did I do something disgraceful for the money?
Yes, that 's right, the prodigal son comes home
Mike fell into a coma . . .
What 's more romantic?
Maybe we . . . and Susan is in another man 's arms . . . in a blink of an eye
E die B ritt was the first to find Mike awake
When she made sure Mike was awake...
M i k e ?


E die decided to hurry up and tell everyone the good news
Emergency situations !
Emergency situations !
my friend just woke up from a coma
Then the news spreads
Mike 's doctor, Craig, was busy treating another patient when he got the news
C raig immediately called aunt I da I da who was busy knitting and told Lynette S cavo who was busy watering the grass Lynettescavo told Tom who was busy playing CS
Tom texted his friend Carlos, who was busy planning a divorce
Carlos told his soon-to-be ex-wife Gabrielle and Gabrielle was planning a divorce
In this way, the news of Mike 's recovery has been spread and disrupted everyone 's normal life. . . everyone. . . except for Susan Mayer
She 's doing something . . . something she 'll regret soon Edward Sibley is the founder of the town of Fairview

Before he was a smuggler . . . a lover . . . and a horse thief
Of course no one remembers Edward 's past
Because his history has been rewritten . . . and all this Breehodge knows best
Are you going to lie to everyone?
I don 't think it 's called lying . . . just making up a little story explaining where you went
I can 't say you sleep in a ragged cardboard box on the side of the road every day, right?
Then why am I going to this historical exhibition?
It 's just a boring game at school
Danielle can 't win again
she never won anything
Is it uncomfortable to eat with a plate?
If you want to be more comfortable, you can go straight to the garbage
This is a family event everyone should go
Danielle stop hurting your brother give him an excuse
I know
Say he was involved in a priestly group and had to lock him up and educate him
Well, then our family 's name must have started.
Why don 't we come and celebrate?
Not as good as . . . said he went to drama camp
His acting interest is often reflected in life, so don 't give up and make a joke with us
Yeah he 's always been like that
Why can 't I tell you the truth?
I made a mistake and got kicked out of the house by you I lived on the street and now I 'm back
We gotta think of a name for this camp
Tie sale is on!
Famous designer 2 for a dollar!
Do you like this barbell?
Make a price, I want to be generous
The customer I was waiting for came
I bought this for 5 bucks
Carlos, have you seen my flyer?
Why do you even sell my clothes and sports equipment?
I can 't sell my own things if I 'm short of money, right?
Those are my fancy pants!
my CD!
Omg! Blankets from my childhood
This is knitted by my mother!
I 'm sad to sell it
But I heard that you have to pay alimony I don 't have enough
I have already done my best
I got a few deals but I can 't make anything like before
Am I to be blamed?
Everyone, pay attention to the following 20 minutes to give away golf clubs with any purchase
Gaby, I 'm very polite now, if you 're still like this, don 't blame me for turning my face away
Baby if these are 30% off . . .
Everyone turns their face and doesn 't recognize anyone!
Cashmere gloves are on sale!
Parker, why aren 't you wearing tracksuits?
The game starts in 1 hour
I 'm not going
what ?
i hate baseball
Dad said I can go without it
Your dad should tell me first so I can prove him wrong
we have to go
But my technique is too bad!
everyone said so
That 's why they pretended to let me in
not fake
Every team needs a backup right long base catcher
let 's practice
let 's try again
very simple
Ready to stare at the ball and swing?
you will make it
Parker must first open his eyes
How can you hit the ball with your eyes closed?
you threw it too fast
throw slower
It 's going to be bowling
What are you doing ?
I tell you what we don 't do - - give up
Did you change your mind again?
No
Lynette I told him he could stop playing baseball
5 games left this season
Say it, do it
Lynette he doesn 't like this and can 't you see he 's not very skilled?
this is not important
The key is to develop a bad habit of retreating when faced with difficulties
It 's just kids baseball
they kill time before eating
Why is what you see so important?
Tom this is called parenting
learn from me
Note that this time it 's a curveball
Again, keep your eyes open
Is it really okay for us to stay another day?
let me think about it
What excuse did I use yesterday?
We 've worked too hard, let 's relax
no, that 's for thursday
More fresh air?
used tuesday
With Julie to spend more time with her dad
so smart !
Looks like we 'll be fine if we want to live until Christmas
Did you know . . . sometimes when you laugh . . . make me feel . . .
What? What do you want to say?
Makes me think I might be in love with you
I don 't mean 'love' like a student
the kind of love for fireworks or school bells
It 's that kind of . . . as if . . a joke I suddenly heard during a boring job
The feeling of touching you when you 're hurt The feeling of suddenly hearing a whistle at a dead party
do you mind . . ?
I 've been a little flabbergasted
Me too
I think I can eat it myself
You said that yesterday and the wound opened like jelly
you heard the doctor say
You 'll have to take a few weeks off before you can move around
I just want to go home now
Your home has moved to the hospital
The whole street wants to see you
Bree also made a peach pie for you
Is it the one with the red hair?
Yes
Husband is a doctor . . .
called Rex
Reex is dead
what ?
when did it happen ?
About a year and a half ago .
what ?
Really you attended his funeral
Are you kidding me? It 's impossible
I saw him before the accident
M i k e . . .
What year is it now ?
2 0 0 4
What 's up ?
This is called memory regression loss
caused by trauma to the front of the brain
You say he lost his memory for 2 years ?
Is it abnormal?
Patients usually only lose memory for a few weeks
Maybe he 's hurt more than he thought
So can he get his memory back?
Maybe at least part of it
Of course you can also help him recover
How to do it ?
Show him some item photo letters . . .
Help him recall what he has forgotten
I think I can help him fill in some gaps
Did you know that Burnham Fox is looking for a new director?
P.R? How do you think I 'm going to work at P.R?
Good team with short hours and high pay . . .
What the hell am I thinking?
Wife, haven 't we talked about that I can pursue my dreams?
I 'm just talking
Change the batter!
Is he on?
Come on Parker!
Keep your eyes on the ball!

Great shot! Is he just a kid?

do not do that

Great shot! That 's impolite
Parker hits a shot and that 's it!
Just one ball!
Can 't blame your son for being the best pitcher in the league
Who 's kid is he like a machine?
N i c k y   A b b o t t
he is my neighbor
That kid 's arms are as strong as a 13 year old

Three strikes out!
again ?
I 'm going to buy him an ice cream
son is alright
You will be the winner next time!
What else do you know about this kid named Nicky?
50 cents less
I have the money
I 'll pay for that kid

thanks
Aren 't you Parker Scavo 's mother?
That 's right
Come
let 's chat

Um. . .
Are your hands a little tight?
I heard that your dad lost his job
it 's so bad
That 's right, the pocket money is gone.
No way !
Children must have pocket money
Otherwise, how can I buy what I want?
like this marshmallow
It tastes like heaven, right?
i have an idea
we can help each other
My son 's batting level sucks
everyone knows

Have you seen this?
Carlos what are you doing here?
Except staring at my property
I have some news to tell you personally I want to see your reaction
I don 't want to fight with you anymore
real ?

Thank you
Now that you see my expression, you can go now
wait, what else?
Now that I 've given you all the money, I 'll save some expenses like paying the rent
Fortunately, the lawyer said that I have every right to do so. . .
baby i 'm back
Wait! You can 't live here!
This is what I expected
Change the batter!

nice shot !
The ball is too slow
His arms must be dead. Yeah already throwing so many fastballs . . .
Come on Parker!
You can do it!
nice shot !

Oh my God !

- Mr. F aladi- what 's the matter?
Thank you so much for making Danielle interested in history
I 've never seen her so serious
To tell you the truth, she 's my best student
It 's great to hear that A ndrew is back
Where has he been during this time? Drama Camp -- a well-known drama camp

do i know you
It 's the car with the reclining seats.
please let me
Isn 't that Dr. Keck?
You know him ?
Well we . . .
met at a drama camp
my God
you mean . . .
That 's right . . .
once 'performed' for him
Are you OK ?
i 'll be fine
I 'm very good
H o w a r d   k e c k ?
Are you sure? He 's a very prestigious man in the society
Actually they are all like that
What did you and Andrew say at the exhibition today?
nothing
I 'm going to make a cup of hot cocoa
Do you want it? Orson I saw what the two of you whispered after Dr. Keck left

What happened ?
Well I promised A ndrew not to tell but I don 't want to keep a secret from you
Don 't say I told you
OK
what exactly is it ?
how to say ?
When Andrew was on the streets he not only begged for money
Sometimes he . . .
He 'll figure it out
very good
I mean don 't want him to have no sense of working to make money what I 'm trying to say is . . . someone hired him to do some
not very glamorous things
physical activity?
I 'm afraid not
Orson don 't scare me
Did he do anything bad?
no !
not a bad thing
People will do it and I will do it with you
It 's just that I won 't pay you
I think you need some hot cocoa
We can 't just judge A ndrew like this
He didn 't care about anything
i will never forgive myself
It 's all my fault for him
Bree, don 't blame yourself, the important thing is that he came home well
How does Dr. Keck have anything to do with these things?
Are you giving Andrew a cure?
In fact I think he 's an A ndrew client
H o w a r d   K e c k ? !
this is ridiculous
He has a wife and daughter
He was also on Tom Scavo 's bowling team.
Apparently he does more than that
It 's a nightmare, an absolute nightmare, don 't move that pie
for mike
M i k e ?
D e l f i n o ?
yes i left you two messages
Did you not check your voicemail?
he woke up

Who is it? Is it Sharla Banning?
I won 't say who this person is
I just wanted to ask if you know a husband is unfaithful would you tell his wife?

I would if he was unfaithful his family could get sick because of it
That 's what I thought too
That 's how B unny Connors got sick
She told me it was because she was wearing someone else 's swimsuit
Not her kind of pubic lice


Poor B unny is always in trouble
It 's not an infection, it 's a plastic surgery problem
Do you all think I should tell this man 's wife?
I don 't think women always want to know if their husbands are loyal but resent the person who told them
So if Tom betrayed me, would you hide it from me?
right !
But I 'll hire someone to teach him a lesson
you are so considerate

Bree I 'm sorry you should go with the flow even though it 's not easy

Gaby . . . you and Carlos got back together?

Why do you ask that?

excuse me
What are you doing?
I told you I have friends here
IM thirsty !
this is my kitchen
hi ladies !
Put on your pants for God 's sake!
I thought too but someone threw my pants out of the dryer before they were dry!
this is what you deserve
what are you talking about ?
- Don 't admit it! You urinated in my shampoo - what?!
The cap is loose I know how dirty you are
Is it ?
I wouldn 't put it in the shampoo if I had to
I 'll sprinkle it in your mouthwash soup and coffee!
goodbye

To answer your previous question, we didn 't get back together

i like this music
What is it about? Sex regrets and cigarettes

cigarette ?
I guess it 's a french song
they know this
I want to go to France one day

Do you want to go next month?
you are serious ?
Of course I 'll go on a business trip with me
I an I just recently took a week off
I can 't find an excuse to take another leave
you will find a way
It turns out that neither of us are sane people
Um. . .
Well
You gotta promise me we won 't be in a hotel all day
dear this is paris
You can have sex wherever you want
Didn 't you say that no one would look for it here?
I don 't know who was lucky enough to call in.
don 't pick up
It 's Julie, I have to pick it up
Hello? What 's the matter?

I can 't hear you . . . can you say that again?
poor signal
what ?
gosh
What happened ?
Mike woke up
Julie when was he . . .
J u l i e ?   J u l i e !
Damn it!
gosh

Oh my God !
I. . .
I have to go
i have to get out of here
ok of course
uh . . . you 're sitting on my bra

What does the coach say?
What more do you think he can say?
Parker was removed
It 's not fair! It 's not his fault!
It doesn 't matter that his mother bribes an 8 year old pitcher
By the way, he was also delisted
How can it be
What the hell are you thinking? I just want to help my son regain his confidence

With a $50 bill ?
Honey if you listen to me and let parker quit nothing will happen
I 'm sorry I can 't make my son a backslider
It 's really a bit more for me to think that there are two people in the family.
What do you mean? You said you supported me in giving up advertising to pursue my ideals
But it 's clear to me that you regret it
that is not real !
So what do you mean by that Burnham Fox job? I think since you haven 't figured out how to make your dreams come true, it 's good to make money now

I have dreams too
This home is one of them
It 's like I don 't... .
Are you arguing? No!
No excitement from us because you won 't have to play baseball anymore


Wouldn 't that be nice?
But I can 't stop now
what ?
until I get better
you are right mom
I just need more practice
Come on let 's practice!
I 'm waiting for you outside!
What 's the next item in your godchild 's handbook?
I an can you hurry up?
I 'm already very fast!
We should have been on our way 10 minutes ago
It 's not as simple as checking out of a hotel
The door has to be locked and I have to turn off the gas
Can 't you do these things later?
A little later? Wait until the raccoons make their home here?
Of course, they were the ones who were laughed at when the gas exploded.
Mike is awake now!
He 'll lie there wondering where I 've gone
yes i understand you are in a hurry
just give me a minute
I believe you will hurry up if Jane wakes up
This bikini photo was taken from the pool dance you took for me
You should tell me I 'm a little dewy
S u s a n   M a y e r
Do you recognize her?
Yes
She is very pretty
yes it 's nice in this photo
Is there a date on this?
The nurse said she came to see me often
Are we close?
you just woke up
Can we talk about S ysan after you recover a little stamina ?
why ?
gosh
I hate to tell you . . .
- if you don 't want to . . .
- That bitch treats you like cow dung
She tricked you into running away with other men
You and her have broken up twice
Then why does she still come to see me?
She 's a bit annoying, and I 'm worried she 's running and shutting off your oxygen or something

But don 't worry
She 's on good terms with others, and she should still be happy in the mountains now.
She told the nurse she loved me
Don 't forget about Susan
she 's a liar

Are you waiting to meet Mike Delfino ?
Yes
I am . . . one of his neighbors
Someone has come to see him now. I 'll come next time.
Well don 't be surprised if he doesn 't know you
He has severe amnesia
real ?
Oh that 's too bad
Are you sure you 're not going in?
Miss B ritt is always here and she doesn 't mind
No, I 've waited so long, it 's okay to wait

G a b y !


Hey Carlos what 's up?
My key won 't open the door
That 's probably because I changed the lock
- Gaby ! - Couldn 't be safer
You may break in at any time if you are not careful

Hello, is it 9-1-1?
Someone broke into my house
Can you tell them to bring a gun when they come, maybe a mexican
i told you i was her husband
I bought this house for her. My name is on the deed.
Ma 'am if he 's your husband there must be a government record
I can find out soon
Okay but our divorce got tangled up and he moved back in
Everybody knows the wife should live in the house and the husband moves to the apartment he hates
This is the American way to call my lawyer
It 's perfectly legal, she knows
She just wants to fuck me
I understand
You won 't believe what my wife did when I got divorced

Wow you can 't shield him!
Police are not allowed to be protective
i pay you
T ed did you see it?
This lady just attacked me
just take a photo
T ed does this hurt?

Get your hands off!
The police have gone wild!

it 's all my fault
Why punish Parker?
Sorry Ms Scavo
rules are rules
I can 't get him back on the team, just one more game.
The other kids he 'll screw up will laugh at him he 'll quit again
See it 's good for everyone
I hope I can help but . . .
Can 't you break the rules once, please?
Did you know the team needs some new helmets?
Are you asking for a bribe?
Haven 't you done this?
I 'm going to get the checkbook
Hello Vera
I made you some umm cream cookies you like
you are so sweet
Come in for a cup of tea
have not seen you for a long time
there 's a lot to talk about
Yes
Yes

I know how painful it is for you
It 's also not easy for me to think about the role of A ndrew in it
Why are you telling me this?
I think you should want to know
why ?
so you can do something

Do you think I 'm a fool?
Lived with a man for 27 years and didn 't know what he did? I always assumed Howard had some...
The way to vent has an unknown friend
I have no idea
I don 't care to find out
But thank you for such a vivid description of my husband 's behavior
I 'm very sorry
- I just feel like if it were me I would . . .
- you 'll want to know
yes definitely want to know
Then I 'm going to say sorry because I know a secret in your family
What? Actually it 's no secret
My daughter told me it 's a well-known secret in the cheerleaders
What is it?
In fact Danielle slept with her history teacher

Where has my demeanor gone?
I should send some cookies too
Attention batters!
Are we not celebrity parents?
Sitting in the audience waiting for our son to fail and then we can escape a bribery scandal
Bribe twice
Gotta count the helmet
one hit
You know what I don 't think you 're a coward
very good
you don 't blame me?
Do not
A bad shot! Well there might be a little why ?
You should follow your dreams and I 've dedicated the rest of my life to advertising
Missing two hits
Maybe I want to write a book or you know how to start my own magazine but I thought 'no I can 't'
I have a family to support this job would be great
Two bad shots! Most of the time
do you know ?
I want to try the Burnham Fox job
Don 't even think about it!
You have to pursue your dreams and I will support you 99%
That 's all I want



How on earth did he do it?!
they cheered for him
He will never quit again!
How are we going to tell him?
Run! Run!


I don 't know dude doesn 't look bad
Maybe the rest of the season won 't compare
Oops
hey but you know what? that 's a good revelation
of course


i posted bail
we can go


- Gaby - Don 't talk to me
be happy
You were only in there for an hour
The whole thing is hilarious, you know

Alright Gaby !
We 've been fighting for months
we 're in a truce, okay?
You and I both know we 'll be reconciled eventually
wow you are crazy
The not really crazy thing is to just leave the three years together like that
I mean why can 't we say how we really feel?

Okay, let me say it first
i still love you
That 's too bad because I don 't love you
yeah that 's right
I do not love you
And it 's been a long time since I didn 't love
that 's a lie
You just said it to hurt me
No if I really wanted to hurt you I 'd tell you what happened last week
I slept with John R owland last week


Carlos what are you doing?
C a r l o s !
what are you doing? !
C a r l o s !
You can 't leave me in such a deserted place!
C a r l o s !
d a n i e l l e !

Danielle is your history teacher and he 's 35 years old!
Robert says age is just a number
How dare you leave this room!
You can 't separate the two of us! ! I love him and he loves me too!

Forget it mom
I 'm tired of feeling like the worst mom in the world
you are not the worst
And grandma, I 'm just trying so hard to be a good example

I did everything I could to teach you the difference between right and wrong
Why is it useless at all?
it works
I mean we know the difference between right and wrong
Why do we deliberately choose the wrong one?
Sometimes it looks more pleasant when you force a child to go one way or the other
you are horrible
yeah i know
I condemn irresponsible parenting

You know we never talked about you . . .
what happened when you left
I just want you to know that you can tell me anything you want
thanks
not now
Okay ?

I 'll come back later to get my bag

It 's not my fault you weren 't there
What?
I am not wrong
- I know how you feel - how could you possibly know how I feel
For six months I prayed every day for him to wake up and you made me give up on him
I didn 't force you yeah it wasn 't intentional but it turned out like this
Your sweet and charming British accent
That 's why when my prayers come true I lie naked in someone else 's arms hundreds of miles away
It wasn 't supposed to happen You could say it wasn 't what you wanted Say you felt guilty Say it wasn 't the right time But . . .
But you can 't say this shouldn 't have happened!
Because you are . . . meeting you was the best thing I 've been through all these years
I an I 'm sorry
I know how you feel
But he 's Mike
is my Mike

ok then you should go

thanks


oh god
you woke up hello Susan
Oh my God !
It 's great to still hear your voice
They say you always come here yeah! yeah I come almost every day
I can 't tell you how much I regret not being by your side when you wake up
Where have you been ?


i 'm in the suburbs
but i 'm back now
OK

What 's wrong with you...
Are you happy to see me here?
To be honest I don 't remember you
What?
I remember moving to fairview and meeting a lot of people I don 't remember after that
The doctor said it was a traumatic brain injury

but you 'll be fine
I 'll help you remember everything
If you don 't mind I 'm a little tired
OK

to you . . . you go to sleep
I 'll come back tomorrow
J

i need treatment
Let 's talk next week

All right

We all have reasons to rewrite history
Sometimes we need to find excuses for ourselves
Drama camp is awesome hmm i mean no one cares about you
Sometimes we want to hurt those who have hurt us
Tell Carlos he can take the album, she says it has no emotional value for her
Sometimes we just don 't want to embarrass ourselves
I don 't know where these words come from
No Parker quit baseball because he sprained his foot
Of course sometimes rewriting history is just another way to lie
Poor Howard had to work late today
Of course he did it all for his family
But what exactly is history . . .
you said i dated susan for a long time
Do you think I love her?
Is it just a series of lies?
I don 't think I really . . . really don 't think so
