0 0 : 0 0 : 0 2 , 5 0 0 - -&gt; 0 0 : 0 0 : 0 4 , 4 0 0 JOHN , you 're just a doll You and I - have no future
Remember the days of working 60 hours a week?
(I can 't take it back)
you will never find any
I 'd rather find someone in DIERDRE than me
Did you shoot yourself?
Very unconvincing, right?
- (The consequences have already happened) - Mom!
You don 't want to take her away from me
go out
I want you to see something
They said they found it in Mike 's garage
Is that blood?
( BREEVANDEKAMP believe )
(old-fashioned values)
(such as respect for God . . . )
( emphasis on family . . . )
( and love for the motherland )
(In fact, BREE is too obsessed with his own values)
so that whenever she faces someone whose values ​​differ from hers
she 's always shocked
This is not mine
You promise not to betray me again, REX
you guaranteed
Can we stop yelling at each other?
i feel bad today
I want you to leave this house!
BREE , look at me
This is not mine
Okay, so, whose ?
There 's no way it just magically popped up in my laundry basket
It seems that I 'm not the only one in this family
people who use this
Do not
Feel sorry
ANDREW IS A CHILD
He 's 16 years old, that 's not uncommon
darling, you must talk to him
What to say to him?
Tell him we found his condom
tell him to ban that . . .
I can totally tell him we think he 's too young
But I don 't think this will have any effect
Well, we can at least search his room
If you find this thing, it will be confiscated
What can be done in that case?
If we take his condoms, maybe--
He 's a teenage boy, let 's take his 'little brother'
He still tries to have sex
But we can 't put this back in his room
I mean, that 's like
We 're acquiescing him to immature sex
BREE , let me put it another way
Do you want to be a grandma?
(Yes, BREE believes in old-fashioned values)
(But she also believes... )
(and regret it later)
(Not as safe as beforehand)

(In the suburbs, every morning comes)
(all accompanied by a series of lies)
(Small innocuous lies not intended to hurt others . . . )
Good morning, Mrs. Petchel, you look so beautiful
(but to make life better)
(they tell these lies to protect themselves)
(and their reputation)
oh god this is unbelievable
That was the last time I used online banking
Of course, every now and then, someday
Someone will decide to tell the truth
He was shot?
How could you not tell us about this?
He felt embarrassed and said it was an accident
Oh, don 't look at me like that, sometimes there are surprises
We know you want to trust MIKE
But we found a dead woman 's jewelry in his garage
Is it? We can 't be sure yet
What we know is
LYNETTE 'S CHILDREN FOUND THAT
So you mean the twins killed MARTHA?
I don 't think so
I mean
MIKE can 't be a murderer
He 's a good guy, I know him
I mean, he 's-- he 's Mike
To be honest, I don 't think Mike did it either.
But if we don 't report
We are suspected of withholding evidence
Know what I think? If he 's innocent
then things will be clear soon
But we 'll do whatever you want us to do
ok, call
So should I just call 9 1 1?
- It 's not an emergency either - it 's a murder
And it didn 't happen recently. I think it 's better not to take up other people 's phone time.
Can you hurry up?

Hi
my mom could come back anytime
If she sees you here, she 'll go crazy
oh i just wanted to deliver this myself
i 'm preparing a party
You know she doesn 't want us to meet again
you should come
I-- I did it all for you
I 'll try to talk to my mom, okay?
But you really should go
Hi Mrs SOLIS
Excuse me, do we know each other?
I 'm JUSTIN - - JOHN 's roommate
I 've been waiting for you for a long time
Really? Why?
i want to do you a favor
What are you busy with?
JOHN says
You have no money for a gardener now
I told him I would love to . . .
Free service
Do you want to mow my lawn for free?
mow lawn, water flowers
And pruning
I can do anything JOHN does for you
You are very kind, but I don 't want you to do it
why ?
Because my husband is often at home these days
If it 's time for pruning, he can do it
this is a beautiful yard
I 'm sure it needs some extra care
I 'm honored, but no, thank you
Mrs SOLIS, please
Did I tell you why my husband is often at home?
he is under house arrest
Oh ?
He is angry with the government now
I was looking for someone to vent my anger
hi guys ?
This isn 't a hockey rink. Can you play outside?
Hi dear. How are you today ?
I didn 't get promoted to deputy director
Oh TOM , I feel so sorry for you
I really can 't understand
I am PETERSON 's best man
T I M   D U G G A N
Biggest braggart in this office
How can I be promoted to deputy director before me?
I thought you liked TIMDUGGAN
I like him. Just. . .
I don 't know. I just--
I really hope to get promoted
Hey kids, can you go outside and have the STANLEY Cup Final?
Did you tell Mr. Peterson that you wanted the job?
I 've been working in that firm for 8 1/2 years
DUGGAN has been here for less than 2 years
I don 't want to beg
I 'm not asking you to beg
Sometimes you have to take the initiative to stand up
Must see your opportunity and seize it
No one respects the shy
There are many styles of leadership
Mine is quiet but effective
Take that racket outside!
Whatever suits you
S U S A N
Hi sweetie. Where have you been?
I called you twice. Are you avoiding me?
Don 't be silly. Why would I do that?
No, I 'm just busy shopping for groceries
Two days? There must be a lot of inventory, right?
Shall we have dinner together tonight?
Well. . .
Have dinner together tonight? Uh . . .
Are you OK ?
Can you get some of these things?
Back to the station is good!
you have the right to remain silent
Anything you say can be
As evidence of Chen Tang
You have the right to a lawyer
If you cannot afford attorney fees
A lawyer will be assigned to you
I heard people say--
ZACHYOUNG will have a pool party on Saturday
He sent out a bunch of formal invitations
It 's all beautiful fonts
I wonder why he didn 't spray them with beauty lotion
What 's wrong with beautiful invitations?
Mom, it was a pool party
Why can 't he just hand out flyers in the neighborhood?
Because he doesn 't know how to be cool by nature?
So, um, are you going?
hmm maybe
I mean, LISA and JUSTIN - -
Some guys thought it would be fun to be able to swim
We can go away anytime
If that party was as boring as we thought
Um, is Lisa your friend who has a pierced belly button?
Yes
The two of you have been together a lot lately
isn 't it?
I think so
oh, um, ANDREW
I want you to be home before 11pm on Saturday night
11 o 'clock ?
Mom, that 's not even a campus event
BREE , curfew won 't work
You may be able to give up all your responsibilities as a parent
but I can not
What exactly is going on ?
Is it something to do with the condom you left in my room?
In fact, yes
Let 's be clear, if you get Lisa pregnant
you 're going to marry her
ANDREW , it 's not funny
Mom, believe me- - this is hilarious
Mainly because that condom is not mine
You 're a jerk, you know
Obviously we need to talk
I 'm still a virgin if that 's what you wanna know
very good
But why on earth do you need a condom?
Because I 'm planning to have sex with someone else
And I don 't want to get pregnant
DANIELLE , you are the president of the ascetic club
I don 't want to run for re-election
J O H N
JOHNROWLAND ? I thought you broke up with him
no, he dumped me
You know why? Because I won 't have sex
If he 's that kind of boy, just take this opportunity to leave him
Mom, every boy in my school is like that
in addition. . .
JOHN 's case is different
I love him
oh baby
It 's not that you have sex with a boy
In exchange for his love for you
maybe i 'm stupid
So what? It 's just sex
Baby, I 'm thinking of your happiness
I understand what it feels like to be young
that urge
But I waited until after marriage
So did your dad, so much better than you are now
But Dad still betrayed you in the end
yes, um. . .
since he moved back
you 've always been miserable
why do you say that?
The wall between our bedrooms is paper thin
I heard a lot of things that maybe shouldn 't
Oh
you see mom, i love you so much
But you really are the least qualified
someone who advises others on sex and pleasure
Have you seen these?
Another five overdue notices
don 't worry, i can handle it
How do you deal with it?
Can I finish the sandwich first?
Have you looked at our most recent checking account number?
we are broke
And soon we 'll have to pay the mortgage
- We still have property taxes - - - GABBY, it 's alright
No, we have serious problems
Your non-worry attitude is driving me crazy
You see, things will get better
- When? - I don 't know when
But we are the lucky ones, we will be lucky again
what is that ?
is a weeder
We have a new gardener today
And it 's free
- THIS BOY IS JOHN 'S FRIEND - CARLOS - -
And he said he would like to take care of the lawn for free
Can you believe it ?
we are lucky
you succeeded !
Yeah, DUGGAN !
Come on, man!
Great! Hi guys nice to see you again
Hi
Don 't be gloomy. You 're going to play soon
Oh, not like that
This is my 'hate TIMDUGGAN' expression
Oh !
DUGGAN successfully hit

Look at that bastard who steals other people 's work and has a good time
GGAN is performing his famous
Chasing the quick steps of a vanity bastard
I forgot how funny it is when you hold a grudge
Oh look, he 's rushing to the extra base
It 's like rushing into additional business areas
Hit hard for underappreciated all-rounder TOMSCAVO
Oh !
DUGGAN is down!
DUGGAN is down!
That must be painful
The vanity chasing guy got hit
It seems that this time he
Out of the blue, that TIMDUGGAN
T O M . . .
Oh no, you see I 'm sure he 's just making a fuss
Oh my god
isn 't it?
It 's just a pool party, everyone will be there
I said 'no'
what do you think
Build a boy no-go zone around me until I 'm 18?
In a few more years you 'll be able to date boys
just can 't be with that boy
Why do you hate ZACH?
I don 't hate ZACH
I just think he 's a little crazy
Mom, I 've heard people say you 're crazy
I 'm crazy cute and he 's crazy
S U S A N   M A Y E R ?
Yes
I am COPELAND detective
I 'm in charge of investigating the MARTHAHUBER murders
I want to talk to you about MIKEDELFINO
Do you remember on the 7th of last month
Have you seen Mr. Delfino?
Is number 7 important?
we believe
MARTHAHUBER was murdered that night
The last time someone saw her
It 's around 9 at the grocery store
Then she didn 't go
Next day appointment at the dentist 's office
What day of the week is that?
Sunday
oh my gosh yes
Yes Yes
Yes, I- I was with Mike that night
- Are you sure? - Yes
Yes, that night meant a lot to our relationship
that was our first time
Your first time . . .
Done
they have sex for the first time
- JULIE ! - That 's true
- How did you know that? - I 'm not clueless.
I found men 's gym shorts in my clothes basket
Oh, don 't write that down
Oh, but that 's good. You can leave MIKE alone
he is innocent
If what you told me is true
It 's true. The next morning
She made pancakes in the shape of little hearts
really, little love
Oh my god
JUSTIN, what are you doing here?
Well, I finished the hedge
What else does Mr. SOLIS want me to do?
I don 't know, he 's not here
He has a meeting with his lawyer
Then I think we 're alone together
no, that means i 'm alone
you are leaving
I 'm in no hurry
Come on, maybe we can stay together for a little while
i don 't think so
bring it on
If you get to know me, you 'll find me interesting
all my friends say
I have no interest in being one of your friends
leave my bedroom
Please, Mrs. SOLIS, be more obedient
you shouldn 't do that
you know how easy it is for me
call my husband and tell him
Did you just try to do what you wanted to do?
not like
I told your husband it was so easy for you and JOHN
I- I 'm sorry, Mrs. SOLIS
But you have to be nice to me . . .
at least once
M I K E !
Are you OK ?
uh, yes, yes, I 'm a little embarrassed
I must be the talk of the neighbors
no, really not, no
Guess what--
I gave you an alibi
I told the police we . . .
We were together the night Mrs. Huber was killed
And I 'll never forget that night
So you don 't think I killed Mrs. Huber
no, no, of course not
I never thought you would kill anyone
Even though I am not your alibi and in fact I am
I, um... .
I 'm going to take a shower
Prison is dirty
I 'll call you later, okay?
OK. When ?
later
ok i have something
Let 's deal with it, okay?
OK
Mrs. VANDEKAMP
hello john
sorry i 'm not invited
Do you have the time ?
Of course
So. . .
Is there anything I can do for you?
I 'll tell you
My daughter is going to give you her first
I want you to do me a favor
don 't accept her
- hi- hi
How is the situation with TIM?
He has three tubes in him
But it 's alright
thank goodness
Of course, it 's not all good news
He will be out of work for 4 to 4 and a half months . . .
Oh
what ?
The company still needs to expand, so I think
They need someone to replace a smart guy like me
stand up and take the burden
Are you going for a promotion at TIMDUGGAN?
no. i already got it
You should see what I did today
I rushed straight into Peterson 's office
tell him
If he gets promoted to DUGGAN, he 'll be a fool
You call your boss an idiot?
Yes
In retrospect, it was quite an adventure.
But you know what, he still gave me that job
oh god! that 's great
darling, this is me
I 'm the winner I got the whole west coast--
Oh, my-- what?
What? The entire west coast?
I thought you were after a position at headquarters
No, no, no. I will have an office starting in Seattle all the way to Los Angeles
I- I told you
no
you have not
All right
So there will be some more travel, but--
More travel ?
TOM , you 're only at home half the time now
And now your workload is doubling?
darling, please, don 't spoil this
I 'm sorry, but you should talk to me
I talked, you told me not to be shy
to come forward
I thought it was a HQ position
ok, i 'm going to take a shower
wait a minute
I know what it means to you
no you don 't know
No, you don 't know, I 'm 41 years old
If I can 't be deputy director now
never can
This is my profession, this-- this is important to me
Mine too, but I 'm here, aren 't I?
I 'm taking this job
she said you broke up with her
because she refuses to have sex with you
oh. um. . .
Well, the fact is this--
I said that, but it was just an excuse
I mean, the truth is... .
i don 't like her that much
real ?
She was always so proud that she never did that
So I thought, hey, that 's my way out
but she likes you
Don 't get me wrong, she 's a good girl
the fact is. . .
I have someone else
Oh
Is your relationship stable?
not at all
we used to see each other often
But this other lady-- girl--
she dumped me
Oh I see
I 'll talk to DANIELLE
do not worry- -
I will reject him tenderly
Well, actually, I hope you 're not gentle
what ?
I know my daughter, she 's a stalwart
unless you make it clear to her
Otherwise, she will always think that there is still hope
ok i 'll make it clear
most. . .
be cruel
Decided to pamper your teeth, huh?
I 'll be dead in a year
I have more important things than my waistline
to worry
So. . .
Which woman do they think you killed?
MARTHAHUBER A local nosy
I thought she was just killed by accident
But it 's no coincidence that her jewelry is in your garage.
Did you kill her?
Do not
But whoever framed me, he did a great job
The police are here to check on me
you 're close to something
Even so, I don 't think
I mean people leave traces
And one of those traces would point to DIERDRE
The person who framed you must know this
yeah, maybe
But if I 'm locked in, there 's no point
i have money, mike
One of the perks of being rich
is a sense of security
Know that you can solve everything with money
I don 't want to take money to the coffin
I will use it to protect you
Mrs. SOLIS
hello justin
Hi. What are you doing here?
I 'm coming to talk to your roommate
J O H N ?
I- I thought you guys didn 't talk anymore
Now we have something to talk about--
about you
I
yes. i 'm going to tell him you tried
blackmail me into bed with you
I don 't know how he will react
Mrs. SOLIS--
you can 't talk to john about that
oh i can
And I will, you useless crap
Listen to me, Mrs. SOLIS, I 'm sorry
I 'm sorry, I didn 't want to hold you
Then why did you do that?
i really need to sleep with you
why ?
because. . .
i may be gay
Oh
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Hi !
Daddy! Daddy!
dad !
How are you guys? What 's the matter?
Oh, we 're out for burgers
kids know
you won 't be back before bedtime
So we decided to give the new deputy director a 'surprise attack'
you see
I finally have an office with windows
Yeah, it 's all about windows
hi guys
Hi, who wants to sit in a swivel chair ?
me !
come, come this way. come on
Come on, guys. Are you ready?
Dad, that 's great!
Hold on tight! Hold on tight!
To see the new executive ?
Oh
You understand
Can I tell you a little secret?
Of course
DAN wants to leave promotion to TIMDUGGAN
and I persuaded him
Give Tom a chance
real ?
uh-huh
TOM is an uncompromising workaholic
He desperately wanted this opportunity
Yes, he is
What 's the matter? Aren 't you happy for this promotion?
( LYNETTE realizes )
(She better lie to the boss 's wife . . . )
very happy, of course
thanks
(if her words weren 't so convincing)
Of course
I mean, I 'll miss him
been running around
he can make more money
But he will also miss the birthday celebration
baseball game
Baby 's first few steps . . .
There must be gains and losses
Right ?
I just hope one day
TOM doesn 't look back and regret being away from home too long
Well, I better get there before they break anything
ok see you later
Are you feigning these feelings?
I have a good brother and we are always together
kill time
but nothing special
Only recently, I started slowly
I have feelings for him and I don 't know what to do
Oh
Yeah, so I thought if I slept with someone like you
I can be sure
Don 't worry about it anymore
But why me? You are a handsome boy
Why not 'try the car' with your peers?
Girls gossiping too much
if i do that with someone
And the result... .
I can not
Then everyone in the school knows
i think i can trust you
because you have a husband
I think what you 're saying also makes sense, from . . .
an odd angle
My good brother and I, we are together
It 's been a while, and . . .
I kept telling myself the whole time
That doesn 't mean anything, you know what I mean?
I think I 've been lying to myself
We all refuse to admit something
But you can finally face reality
I think that 's brave
thanks
I should be going
hmm, just wanted to let you know
I never told Mr. SOLIS about you and John
I may be gay, but I 'm not a jerk
How do you feel?
doesn 't seem to
you must be gay
Hi
Hi. Sorry to disturb you at night, Miss MAYER
but i hope you can
Come with me to the police station
Just to answer a few more questions
now? yes- sorry
My-- my daughter and I are going to a movie tonight
mother. . .
We can go another day. I 'm fine
Um. . .
- let me go get my bag - ok
Are you sure you don 't have to go today?
Yes
I won 't be back too late
okay bye
Bye-Bye
You said MIKE 7 was around 10 o 'clock that night
come to your house
Um. . .
Should I say to the camera or...
No, no. Just- - just say it to me
ok. um, ok
He came here at about 10 o 'clock
Do you know what 's the difference between MIKE and MARTHAHUBER?
do not know
Did you know that Mike was shot recently?
Yes
on valentine 's day
Do you know why he was shot?
The gun fell off while he was cleaning it
Miss MAYER, pardon me
I 've been using guns for years
I 've never seen a gun fire when it hits the ground
Someone must have pulled the trigger
i don 't know
Did you know there was a case of trespassing on his house?
Occurs 3 blocks from your house on PINE Street
- The day before Valentine 's Day? - I don 't know.
The bullet hit the intruder 's stomach
Where is Mike 's wound?
stomach
do you love him ?
what ?
What does that matter--
It 's just that sometimes people do stupid things
when they fell in love
I should know. I 've been married four times
tell me the truth
He wasn 't with you that night, was he?
He wants you to lie for him, doesn 't he?
no, he 's with me
Also, Mike didn 't kill anyone, I 'm pretty sure
M I K E   D E L F I N O   - -
Convicted in 1987
Served five and a half years in prison for drug smuggling
and manslaughter
Would you like a cup of coffee? I 'm going to pour a cup
Is she covering up the truth for her boyfriend?
no, she 's just an idiot
I don 't think there 's anyone in the pool yet
Do you want to go swimming ?
Please. I just spent about an hour blow-drying my hair
good luck, man
We- - we 'll see you later, okay?
Okay
Hi
Ha, hi, I have a surprise for you
Looking for a place to talk?
yes we should talk
hi. you made it
ANDREW came too. I thought he wouldn 't come
Yeah, he brought a bunch of friends
They 're like a bunch of idiots
to shock the media
But I don 't mind because you 're here
we will be very happy
come on, man. let 's go
D A N I E L L E
Do not touch me !
hope you can swim
Can you take it easy?
That 's cool, man. Look- - it floats
Are you okay? Take it easy. It 's a party
You are the protagonist of the party, aren 't you?
isn 't it?
I think so
Great, then show it
Come on. Howl twice and listen
Come on, you 're the master. Should put in a little bit
howl twice


forget it
Are you OK ?
Why should I mind?
he is insignificant
If I want to get rid of him, I can do it
What 's the meaning ?
I know where my mom keeps the gun
That 's not fun, ZACH
It might be interesting if you think about it
J U L I E
Hi DANIELLE
Are you OK ?
i just want to go home
Can we go?
Of course
J U L I E
I send DANIELLE home
Are you still back?
Not coming back
Oh
What will happen to the parents?
verbose, haha
Peterson called me into his office today
real ?
Yeah, he, um... .
He changed his mind and planned to . . .
Leave that promotion to DUGGAN
Oh
That- - that- - that 's okay
I 'm very happy, really
I don 't want to work that long
You also know my distaste for flying
it makes my back uncomfortable
And, god, that extra stress
In 10 years, I 'll end up like TIMDUGGAN, so . . .
yeah, of course
So - - it 's over
you will be the deputy director in the future
near future
You know what, it really doesn 't matter, honestly
I, um... .
I 'm really glad it ended this way
oh god you scared me
How are things going?
' great
I 'm ashamed and shocked
S U S A N   - -
how could be ?
Omg-- 'SUSAN, do you trust me?' 'Yes, of course I trust you' Oh, I 'm such an idiot

you 're a big liar
Oh, looks, still a killer and a drug dealer
You have a pretty good 'personal ad' there
SUSAN , I came to WISTERIALANE - -
Shut up! Shut up, MIKE! Stop talking
if you keep talking
you can occupy my heart
And I just don 't want to
Let you get close to my heart again . . .
never
J U L I E ?
mom needs a hug
J U L I E ?
Is JULIE there?
J U L I E   M A Y E R ?
I don 't know. There 's basically no one in there
J U L I E   A L E X A N D R A   M A Y E R !
Oh, JULIE, ZACH, this is ridiculous!
You can 't hold your breath forever!
Oh !
Oh, you better stay down there
Never come up for a breath if you dare to stick your head out
I will pinch you in the dark!
Is my daughter down there?
I 'm not - - I 'm not gay
I - - ok
I-- I 'm sorry
I- -
I 'll leave that here
oh! i 'm fine
Very good. You--


you - - you see - - no. bye
Sold the house. Are you crazy?
CARLOS , we can 't afford this house
But if our lawyers can get the Justice Department
unfreeze my account, then--
So what? Ha? That 's it, CARLOS
We 've got a bunch of fiat bills and you 've lost all your customers
Even with our savings, we 're done
but- -
this is our house
darling, i know
I love this place too
It 's just-- I think we 'd better face reality
I never thought I would be so poor at this age
CARLOS , you know
I 've been bankrupt many times in my life
But I 've never been poor
Because poverty is just an idea in the mind
and now
You and I are just . . .
Lack of funds ?
Completely correct
I think we can find an apartment
restart
Who knows?
it might even be fun
Once we make a comeback . . .
we 'll buy a house as big as this
bigger
I gave my wife a dog for her birthday
A stray dog ​​in an animal shelter
This is one of the cheapest gifts I gave her
But she loves it, and I 'm a genius, right?
Then I found out it had a weird blood disease
Now I 'm spending $600 a month on dog medicine
I 'm a genius for this mongrel, right?
Oh, don 't make fun of yourself, you 've done something nice
make your wife happy
Now. . .
Let 's talk about who 's going to make you happy
(yes, in the suburbs, a new day arrives)
(always accompanied by a series of lies)
(And the worst of them are the ones we use to fool ourselves)
(before we fall asleep)
(we whisper in the dark)
( tell myself. . . )
( we are very happy )
( or. . . )
( he is happy )
( we can change )
(or he will change his mind)
