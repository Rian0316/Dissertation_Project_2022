‎ New site?
‎ Whose turf are you taking?
‎ first
‎ motorcycle gang
‎ Locomotive gang?
‎ Biker?
‎ So you 're going with a group
‎ American Motorcyclist declares war?
‎ This is your plan

‎ Mr. Eladio
‎ These gangs are divided
‎ Let 's sow discord first
‎ Break it down
‎ So you are a businessman
‎ Ignashovaga
‎ What do you want? ‎ - What do I want? ‎ - yes

‎ respect
‎ I want to make my own decisions‎ Do things on my own terms
‎ I don 't want others to dare to play with me
‎ I don 't want to be nervous
‎ You don 't want to be nervous?
‎ Then you 're in the wrong business, friend
‎ you 'll be fine





‎ Really? ‎ really

‎ How do you know?
‎ I asked my people
‎ - Lalo is in Mexico and he 's going to stay there‎ - but you say he 'll probably be on the phone . . .

‎ - Your people? Did he know again? ‎ - He won 't tell me, but he knows
‎ - You believe him? ‎ - yes
‎ So we 're safe?
‎ yes

‎ gosh
‎ my gosh
‎ great
‎ Great, right?
‎ So what 's the problem? it 's over


‎ this time
‎ There will be no next time

‎ Maybe we should check out and go home
‎ My luggage is packed, so is yours‎ Please check again

‎ All paid for tonight
‎ Don 't want to do massages?

‎ Served with Golden Lace Fries with Truffle Salt'
‎ Truffle Salt
‎ I 'm hungry, Jimmy‎ There 's nothing to eat at home anyway, so‎ why not?

‎ I met Howard in court today
‎ Yes? ‎ What did he say to me? A bowling ball crashed his car
‎ A prostitute harassed him at lunch

‎ First off, those things happened to us . . .
‎ Before we get married? ‎ yes

‎ Do you know why Hanlin told me that?

‎ for my own good

‎ When I was waiting for him to come on a white horse?
‎ Actually. . . ‎ all for himself
‎ always for him
‎ This person loves himself
‎ Really need to destroy his prestige
‎ so
‎ What 's next?

‎ You ruined his car‎ and ruined his reputation, so . . .
‎ I think the next one might be
‎ his hair
‎ Right? Suppose . . .
‎ I 'm just brainstorming ‎ but suppose we drug him
‎ When he passed out‎ we took out the old electric razor‎ and shaved him bald
‎ Neil‎ What? ‎ This is an old trick

‎ Sneak into his country club‎ Put Nair cream in his shampoo
‎ When he goes to take a shower...
‎ - hair loss, like‎ - yes
‎ or. . .
‎ We poured a big bucket of chlorine into his pool‎ - and it . . . ‎ - dyed his hair and brows white
‎ Yes, and eyebrows


‎ or
‎ Or we break into his house
‎ Replace all soft toilet rolls‎ with single-layer ones
‎ Hit him directly in the sore spot
‎ Or, whatever tanning agent he uses‎ we switch to sunscreen
‎ He was lying in the tanning machine‎ and it was a waste of time‎ or

‎ or

‎ Or what?
‎ We would never do it, but . . .
‎ Absolutely nothing?

‎ If . . .

‎ What if Howard did something bad?
‎ Like killing the waiter who creamed his cauliflower?
‎ No, I mean really bad things
‎ like inappropriate behavior
‎ Such as misappropriation of funds, or . . .
‎ bribing witnesses etc.
‎ Do you know what this means for the Sandpiper Cross?
‎ Such a large class action? ‎ Possibly the whole fiasco

‎ Cliff Mayne will be furious ‎ He will settle out of court
‎ Reconcile immediately

‎ Will he?
‎ Yes, how much effort do you think they put into that case‎

‎ Nearly two years, right?
‎ In case of breaking the game now, they won 't get a cent, so
‎ Any conditions for Sandpiper Cross? Cliff Mayne will accept it
‎ I 've tried everything I can to reconcile Sandpiper Cross
‎ Yes, but your approach is wrong
‎ I 'm sorry, but that 's the way to go

‎ This is not playing tricks on those old people
‎ If Sandpiper Cross reconciled now, they might get a 15, 20 less
‎ but they can get their money while they can
‎ Lawyers also make money‎ Lawyers make money too
‎ How much mutual funds will you share? ‎ We will share 20% of the mutual funds
‎ I just . . .
‎ - When I didn 't say that, okay? ‎ - good

‎ Being a night owl again today? Are you not sleeping?
‎ Yes, don 't sleep tonight
‎Yeah, I don 't sleep much either
‎ About an hour or two
‎ is enough

‎ this time
‎ I can think
‎ I get the best ideas when everyone is sleeping‎

‎ Some people say it 's a curse‎ I like it
‎ I dare not say that
‎ I 'd rather get some sleep‎ but here we are



‎ Do you have a stronger drink?
‎ That 's about it‎ The glass bottle at the bottom of the bar‎ That 's a good thing‎ Two wine glasses








‎ Back, I thought you were lost
‎ Have you ever drunk Louis XIII? ‎ I don 't think so‎ then you earned it




‎ To sleep and those who need it
‎ Respect for sleep

‎ What are you doing?
‎ These idiots have no respect!
‎ Shiloh!
‎ What 's the matter, asshole?






‎ In the kitchen


‎ Shiloh!
‎ Every time!
‎ Shiloh! come in for me! ‎ Silo
‎ What 's the matter, boss?
‎ - What are you doing? Smoking again? ‎ - Boss, I really don 't have
‎ Silo
‎ Don 't lie to me, don 't blame Miguel‎ I 've had enough of these lies
‎ Boss, I swear to God‎ I have a lighter, you see? not me!






























‎ go in and see where it comes out

‎ What do you see?
‎ It 's a straight road, at least 100 meters
‎ I saw his blood, he didn 't run far. ‎ What sound?
‎ Is that him?






‎ What do you want to add? ‎ A little bit of everything
‎ Or leave out the mint chocolate chips
‎ I set my alarm for 6 o 'clock‎ because we 're checking out and getting home before work

‎ That 's a full two and a half hours.‎ No problem.


‎ What would you do?
‎ I don 't know, what would you do?
‎ I 'll Hire Swaka 's Daisy
‎ Rehiring HHM 's Bruce
‎ I and Viola
‎ I will rent an office in the courthouse‎ Smallest and worst office
‎ Start taking public welfare cases
‎ For the common man‎ Legal representation usually found only in millionaires
‎ I was going to say, let 's buy a house
‎ I 'm sorry, yes
‎ We can do both
‎ As far as I know‎ Sandpiper Cross is willing to give 26 million
‎ One third is 8.5 million
‎ - Its two achievements are . . . ‎ - around two million



‎ But it won 't happen
‎ please, Kim
‎ We 're not talking about bar tricks, we 're talking about scorched earth


‎ we had to hurt him
‎ and seriously injured
‎ To force a group of lawyers to run away‎ Howard is bound to do . . . . ‎ The unforgivable
‎ In the end, he may be able to become a lawyer again.
‎He shouldn 't have ended like this‎ Who knows if we 'll make it?

‎ Well, maybe we 'll make it ‎ but we won 't

‎ We 're talking about career setbacks
‎ A lawyer 's career thwarted
‎ I know, you can help a lot of people‎ I understand, but . . .
‎ Kim, do this . . . ‎ not your style
‎ okay? you will not accept
‎ you calm down and think back ‎ it will not be accepted
‎ Won 't I?





‎ I 'm going to take a shower so I don 't have to wash in the morning
‎ Kim, are you kidding me?















‎ have a middleman
‎ I don 't know who hired us‎ It doesn 't matter
‎ I know


‎ you have to call them‎ and tell them that the process is hard
‎ But mission accomplished
‎ I 'll help you
