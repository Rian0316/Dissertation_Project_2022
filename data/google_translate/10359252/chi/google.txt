in an upscale nightclub
he 's taking you out
in public
Isn 't Rob taking her to the club tonight?
Do you really think I 'll sit back and watch?
Listen, did you move any files while you were in my office earlier?
I know exactly what you shouldn 't touch
I can only work overtime and redo it
Would you like to go to a nightclub with me tonight
Rob let me dove
I like music
- I used to play the piano - do you still play?
my husband doesn 't like me playing the piano
dear your husband is dead
Don 't you think it 's time to stop listening to him?
Dear
Maybe we can do it in your bed when Mr. Grove moves out
He 's not leaving until after my daughter 's wedding
etc
That 's another two months.
She gave me her hand in the marriage hall
- Carl - I will never let go

Damn it
i got fired
Not at all surprising
- Salmonie - I will divorce Carl one day.
but i will never hate him
then what do I do
Have fun in the dining car
The dining car is provided by the company
we 'll figure it out
I don 't have to worry about Duke anymore
He doesn 't text me anymore
what is he
- is he crazy? - kinda
He always said I was stealing food behind his back
Come to Venice with us tomorrow
- gosh - is tomorrow for real?
- Are you going to Venice - I don 't know yet
I asked you before if you were in love with her
Jade is the only easy thing in my life
live with us
stay with us
you just got home
Deadly Woman Season 1 Episode 4
The purpose of an autopsy is to provide clear information
how the victim died
Was it shot to death?
was stabbed to death
still poisoned
It 's easy to understand how a person is killed
It is unclear why he was killed in a few words
But it all starts with a choice
Maybe decided to have an affair
plan to hide a secret from a lover
Or pact to put a stranger to bed
Yes people make all sorts of questionable choices
Of course, that 's what makes me work
The waitress looked at me strangely
you are indoors and wear sunglasses at night
- She seems to recognize me - I don 't even recognize you
Although we 've made love ten times
- be quieter - be calm
Nobody here recognizes you
show me your eyes
I have a present for you
Jewelry?
unnecessary
this is a swatch watch
and waterproof
So don 't worry, I 'm crying with joy
i want to do something special
This is our first date
I mean outside the dining car
It 's not a date, is it?
Why doesn 't it count as we still have food on the table
It 's not even food
It 's hard to be your boyfriend
Boy friend
another word you don 't like
It 's just that I wouldn 't describe you that way
what do you want to call me
- your lover - why do you have to have a job title
Why don 't you just call Tommy?
do you want to wear it
why wear
Because it 's a gift I let you wear it
Oh my god
What 's up
Did I embarrass you?

boo sit down
I 'm sorry I 'll buy you one next time
gifts you would wear on a date with me
like a ski mask
Tommy
I now how to do
do you need anything else
Omg don 't need the food here it sucks
Give you an opinion, he 's too young for you
what does sheila need
My family ran out of food and my kids started protesting hysterically
maybe i can find you a jar of peanut butter
they don 't deserve to eat
What are these skates for?
It 's good looking, this is when Rob and I dated for the first time
bought for me
He took me to the happy hour ice rink
what do you turn them out now
I 'm going ice skating with April later today
- that waiter - yes
We went to the Andy Warhol show last week
Next week she 's teaching me to surf
Can you imagine me going surfing
Wasn 't your plan to gain that girl 's trust and convince her to end the affair?
i 'm doing it
are you sure because it sounds like
You two are getting closer
Maybe a little
April people are nice
she 's very free
You don 't know how happy we are together
she sounds good
For a girl who sleeps with your husband
I know it 's weird but I like her
I can 't help it
What 's wrong with being friends with her?
nothing
As long as you don 't forget that she is also your enemy
Well, let 's just say 'she 's our love'

too blatant
Okay then our 'special friend'
That sounds like I 'm a little retarded
Well she 's the third party in our trio
nausea
Since Jade wants to live with us, we 'll have to find a way to introduce her
Why not say she is our family
I like this
Lovely
Wait
Jade, is that Duke 's car?
damn
Wait, is that scary ex-boyfriend Duke?
you tell him you live here
no i didn 't tell anyone
God, he got out of the car
fuck fuck fuck
ok ok ok ok
ok ok ok
Don 't worry it 'll be alright
- I 'll deal with it- What do you mean by wait?
I 'll go talk to him
- Be straightforward like a man - No Eli
don 't go to Iraq . . .

it 's not good, okay?
Is there a problem
i 'm looking for my girlfriend
someone told me she was here
who is your girlfriend
Jade
Jade
Jade Jade . . . which Jade
she 's in front of that window
Jed, yes
- I 'm going to talk to her - well the question is
She 's not available now so...
I think she is free
All right
Depend on
ok listen
I don 't want to do it with you, okay?
yes you don 't want to
what do you think you are doing
You 're already that gun buddy
You must be Duke, the second felon
It 's all felonies, right?
If I call the police and see you attacking someone for the third time, I think you 're going to strike out.
You shouldn 't want to do this to avoid going to jail again
Tell Jade I 'll contact her
you don 't have to come out
I 'm in control
- Honey this is teamwork - I know
thank you so much
I 'm scared to death


you are my hero
Jade I 'm not your hero
I just want to keep you safe
The Carl Groves invite you to share the wedding of their daughters Amy Lim and Brad Jenkins We should invite the Prescott family to their wedding
do you have to
I can 't stand them either, but they spent 10,000 bucks in the gallery last year
Put them on the pending list
Another pending Amy is coming in an hour
We all promised her that the guest list would be drawn up by then.
How about the . . . the Randalls?
Absolutely not I despise them
When did this happen
We attended their son 's wedding just a month ago
We sent candy trays but never got a thank you card
- That 's too careful - that 's it
How hard can it be to write a thank you card?
i mean you
What 's wrong with you
what 'what 's wrong'
You 've been sullen since you came back last night
what else can happen
Is it because of my broken fingernail?
Is it because my husband slept with a man?
It can 't be because of this
ok don 't tell me
Listen we 've prepaid for 400 guests wedding catering
If we don 't finalize the guest list, Brad 's family will bring in more hillbillies from Oklahoma. The whole wedding will be a square dance.
Are there really square dance parties in Oklahoma?
At least in musicals
Refers to the American musical of the same name 'Oklahoma'
Act Two, Scene One
How did I not see your sexuality in the first place?
what
Amy, you 're early
We haven 't quite finalized the guest list yet
Brad sleeps with his ex girlfriend
The wedding is canceled and I want wine
Yuu 's point
just had a great time
I just want to say that every day with you is like an adventure
We did have a good time, didn 't we?
to be frank
I do feel a little lonely in LA
I understand how you feel
It 's nice to have a girlfriend who really treats you
It 's getting late, I should go back
Wait a minute, do you think there 's still time to take another risk?
- should be - ok
Apple
what the hell do you have
come and taste a piece
Brownie what an adventure
I added a special ingredient
- what is - grass
Pulled from your lawn?
no i mean flying leaves
you know marijuana
You mean 'marijuana' in 'marijuana cigarettes'

listen it 's not a big deal
a lot of people are taking it
Criminals also make music
Please do not get angry
How could you be such a good girl?
it was rob 's idea
your married man
Yes
I never imagined
Take into account your previous description of him
He 's really old-fashioned
I think he 's just trying to find a way to relax

listen I didn 't mean to offend you
I 'm fine, just a little bit out of my expectation
So we 're reconciled again, right?
Great I 'm going to put these up
- Hold on - what 's the matter
I 'll try it anyway
- But how did you find out? - I 've been suspicious for a while now.
Then Brad finally admits he 's been lying to me about Cindy since we got engaged
I know quite a few bitches named 'Cindy'
Did I mention she 's fat? 140 pounds
140lbs where did he find her carnival
It 's not even noon dear
my fianc√© fucked a fat woman
Can I get some comfort?
Feel sorry
So he 's been with Cindy since his engagement?
no i didn 't say that
I was dumbfounded
he 's been lying
That 's what they shot on the weekend you took me to Hawaii
Wait, that was two years ago.
Were you engaged to Brad at the time?
Not yet, but we 're on it
Split and combine
I admit that Brad hadn 't proposed yet, but we both knew he was going to do that.
that is
at least i know
Maybe you should have told him
I can 't believe you speak for Brad
I just wanted to say that the situation may not be so black and white
Brad is a good man you might consider forgiving him
forgive
God, you really married the wrong person
I 'm going back to my room
Honey I know you 're pissed but when you blow on the bottle brad wins

I don 't seem to feel anything
Takes a while to work
I wish I could recognize that feeling
I don 't want to be high and miss that feeling
trust me you will notice
By the way, would you like to order some Chinese food while listening to music?
Aren 't you going to have dinner with your married man tonight?
That is tomorrow and tonight Rob has an arrangement with his wife
what
I don 't know it 's been planned for weeks
Looks like he 's going to have dinner with his boss or something
Wednesday
today is wednesday
Yes what 's the matter
I 'm going to feed my neighbor 's cat on Monday

poor kitten
I should be going
Damn my other skate
- Under your arm - yeah
Thank you for the cannabis treats
fine
where did you go
We should be leaving in 5 minutes
I know I know
are you going ice skating

Come on, we have to go
A few things first
He likes to be called Hal outside the office
His wife 's name is Vivian
Vivian
Dale and Gretchen Clark will also be there
he is tall she has brown hair
Pamla and Joe are the old couple
Myron Paul will go too, he 's the short one
Myron is short
The guest of honor tonight is Mr. Tashiro from Japan
His features should be obvious
why
are you kidding
Of course
Duke please, I 've apologized dozens of times.
what i beg you
please don 't hurt it
Duke Duke please
what 's wrong with you
it 's just a child
Duke
Hey
- God - what happened to Jade
Duke is going to kill the teapot
tea jar
it 's our dog he said if i don 't go see him
he kills it
oh my god
- He can 't do that, can he? - Legally speaking?
I 'm really not sure
He wouldn 't really hurt his dog would he?
He was jailed for nearly suffocating his accountant
My dad is also an accountant
i have to go
i love that dog
Jade this is too dangerous
I don 't care if I have to save the teapot
ok ok but you can 't go alone i 'll go with you - ok - ok


- thank you thank you - all right


what about me
I mean it 's better for two to go with three, right?
yeah ok
Well

If it 's Brad calling, say I 'm not there
hello good morning brad
I 'm not here
That 's right actually Amy . . .
ok you heard
very good
Listen I really can 't say Brad
you know what a woman is like
I understand
you do not say
stop chatting with him
If you don 't really want to say it, you can only say it worse
no i know it 's absurd but . . .
give me the phone
ok i 'm going to the gallery
I wish I could start my day with a kiss

Go and ask the gardener for a kiss
I won 't make the same mistake twice

- Tommy - I didn 't sleep all night thinking about our date
I was so pissed but I shouldn 't have just left - I 'm really sorry - are you crazy

You can 't come to my house with flowers
I didn 't come in until Carl left.
He 's not the only one who can see you coming in
- You have to go now - but you at least take the flowers
- No - if you don 't even accept a small gift
So what do we hope for in the future?
- We have no future - are you breaking up with me?
That 's right, we 're done, let 's go

Tommy Hart
Amy
I haven 't seen you since last Christmas
Yeah, haven 't seen it in a while
hi what are these flowers for
Of course it 's for you
How did you know I was here
what a good question
I called Naomi and told her the wedding was canceled and she told Tommy the bad news
Then he brought you this beautiful bouquet
so sweet
You are welcome
Tommy you really have to go
Amy and I have a lot to do today
I put these in your room
nice to see you amy
Tommy, are you alright tonight?
I don 't know if you 've dated recently, but I really need someone to cheer me on tonight
I was in a relationship but she recently broke up with me
Amy, you can 't go out tonight
We have to tell everyone that the wedding has been cancelled.
So a lot of phone calls
I 'll call again tomorrow
See you at Herbert at 7pm then
we can comfort each other
that 's good
goodbye mrs grove
Amy, what the hell are you thinking?
I was thinking I could go and have a vengeance with Tommy Hart
this . . . you can 't do that
He 's not your type
I know he 's a little young but someone has to teach him
So you told me it 's going to take four hours
right
Really eye-opening
That 's the quick version
here they come
We 're going to send someone to find you.
- I 'm sorry Beth Ann was slow to dress.- Yes
I remember
my wife vivian
Nice to meet you Beth Ann
Meet Gretchen and Dale Clarkson
- And Pamla and Joe Kensington - hi
where is myron
Myron can 't come
This is the guest of honor
This is the young and promising executive I told you about
- Robert Stanton - Sir I am honored
I have heard a lot of compliments on your work
Hope it didn 't live up to your expectations
So Myron isn 't here
Yes
dinner is ready
- can we start? - thank goodness
thanks i 'm starving
What is your name
Beth Ann
You must be Tashiro
Yes
you are right
too obvious
I put location cards for everyone
Mr. Tashiro, sit in the middle
thanks
Beth Ann, have you found your location card?
Dear
sorry i 'm looking at swans
How do you like it
The best thing I 've ever seen
It 's so sweet you can notice
Most people can 't see
Rob, did you see this?
So beautiful
put it on your lap
I don 't want to unfold it, it took a long time to fold it
Nevermind Beth Ann
It 's definitely not that difficult
how do you know
Don 't you fold at all our dinner parties, honey?
so simple?
If I try it, it can be folded.
I bet you can 't
sounds like a challenge
no no she is not challenging you
Stack a swan I bet you won 't
All right
She 's so aggressive, so I 'll accompany her
will be fun for sure
Come on, how do I get started?
I want to flatten first
Smart
I was right when I first folded the trick.
- I 'm not going to help you - all right
blah blah blah blah...
All right
don 't you quit
It 's not that easy, is it?
Okay, I 'll definitely be able to fold it this time.
my fork fell on the ground dear
can you help me pick it up
Row
what 's wrong with you
you look like drunk
Yes
That 's probably because of the flying leaves
flying leaves
it 's marijuana
I had some before dinner
where did you get the marijuana from
What 's up
can 't i just relax
- we 'll talk about this later - fine
Then you can tell me where you got your marijuana from
what
That 's right
I know what you 've been up to lately
All right
impossible
I give up
come and let me help you
Thanks, dear
more like a duck
here it is
Duke 's is at the end of the road
Okay
let 's go
why are you talking like that
how to speak
like a low budget action movie actor
what i don 't have
ok everybody don 't go away
arrive
what is the plan
I 'll knock on the door
I confronted Duke after he opened the door
Can 't confront Duke is a violent criminal
Are you crazy
you brought a hammer
I call this a 'backup plan'
Is this your backup plan to seriously hurt others?
If he hits me first it 's not a crime
He will definitely hit you first
good good good when we got tangled Jade quickly came in and got the dog and we ran away
Darling, this plan is stupid
It hurts but okay you say
This is my plan Duke opens
I gave him a huge check for a dog
Good Duke is always in the pocket
OK if you want to be the kind of guy who solves all problems with money

i want very much
go Jed
Duke
Oh my God
Oh my God
my god is a teapot
baby baby it 's alright
Mom is here
I guess Duke isn 't home
no no impossible
He is absolutely absolutely at home
He doesn 't go to work until five o 'clock
Hurry up Duke open the door
All right
Apparently he 's not at home
Let 's write him a note saying you 've been here and you 're willing to pay him a fortune for a dog
why do we leave it here?
yes it 's temporary
my pen is in the car wait
I do not like this
I know but what else can we do
You don 't understand if something happens to my dog
i 'm going crazy
- ok ok - please please
start the car
what the hell
start the car now
Jade

you are all dead
Mom, did you see my car keys?
I 'm going to be late to see Tommy
Feel sorry
I swear I put it in my coat
what the hell
I 'm going on a date and you 're inviting Aunt Kay to the wedding
it doesn 't make sense at all
I know she 's boring but at least she 'll send a gravy boat
I won 't get married, okay?
I 'm going to have sex with Tommy Hart
if i can find the key
yes dear if
did you hide my keys
Yes
You 'll thank me for sitting down when you 've calmed down
not my key
not in my wallet
I said not there
hold the key, you let me walk
You can 't walk out of the driveway in these heels
I know you 're not happy but if you sleep with Tommy you 'll lose Brad forever
I know this is what I want
But you love him and he loves you too
The wedding hall was booked and the money was paid to the caterer. Your wedding dress is beautiful
What 's the matter with you on Brad 's side
who influenced you
- hello - is that him
it 's you who blame you
sure yes sorry what we are talking about
Amy decides to get revenge on Brad by seducing Tommy Hart
Tommy, he 's too young for you
Is he 17 years old?
He 's mature at 18
but that 's not the point
The lady you promised promised Brad to us and the Biltmore
you 're too good to talk about promises
You and your dad divorced and your second husband also left. Now Carl is sleeping in the guest room. I think you and him are about to break up.
listen
I love Brad but I don 't know if I can trust him I don 't want to be the next you
Married three times at the age of forty
Your keys are in the fridge
let 's go
Amy Amy you are right
Your mom and I do deal with some issues and I 'm not a perfect husband either and maybe neither will Brad
But love always takes risks
I know it 's easy for you to think that love like this won 't last long
so why not end it now but
Opportunities for love don 't come every day
Think carefully before making a decision

Tommy is waiting for me
go go go me
I hope you enjoyed your meal
Do you find my moving speech useful?
The effect is beyond expectations
i have to make a call
baby
I bring the tea jar up there to be comfortable and quiet
Well it 's been a stressful day
What you did today is the best thing anyone else has done for me
- trivial matter - no, it doesn 't matter



damn
Please hide this from him
Okay thank you
let 's go tea jar
so nice
It 's a good day
Yes
I mean we got the dog back didn 't we?
Well I know we broke the law a little bit
It 's you who broke the law more than a little
made me an accomplice
Okay but you see how happy Jade is, don 't you?
- I think it 's worth it - You 're right
The smile on Jade 's face is more than enough to offset the tragedy of my possible disbarment
I 'm sorry I had to do something
No, you don 't have to, I have a plan
yes i have it too
And my plan worked
that 's not the point
No, no, the point is that I finally did something right
you can 't be happy for me
Why should I be happy
For the past two years I 've been that pathetic Eli who couldn 't even finish the script and couldn 't pay the bills I know

you 're disappointed in me and guess what
I 'm disappointed in myself too
- Eli, you 're not pathetic at all - are you?
Because this morning I can 't even protect my own home
I still need my wife to save me
'Cause I thought he 'd beat you up
he might
But your intervention hurts me even more
- i just wanted to help - i know
But sometimes baby
I just need a win
you know what i just want to feel like a man
good enough to save the dog
you 're right
pretty good today
Thank you
I didn 't lock the door
Okay, call the police

listen buddy let me explain first
Do not
come down you bitch
Jade Jade
Jade
Where is she
You made me break my leg you crazy woman
If you mess with my family again, I 'll break your other leg
- is it delicious? - delicious
- what about yours - very nice
Good
So you 're going to college in the fall?
- School of Art - yeah
you like to draw
So cute
Um
what to do
sorry to interrupt your date hello tommy
mrs grove
what are you doing mom
I 'm looking for you
what to do
I brought someone
Brad wants to talk to you
I 'm having dinner
Tommy doesn 't mind, do you mind?
do not mind
- Salmony - don 't look at me
people will see
OK
I have something to tell you
Listen, I 'm dating Amy to make you jealous
It 's silly to do this, I 'm just hurt
because i like you
I was thinking if we formally defined our relationship then I 'd know how you feel about me but you 're not interested so I 'd give up
you can watch me now
I must like you to wear this ugly crying thing
Yo, it looks like the wedding will be held again as scheduled.
obviously yes
Back to our topic are you free on friday
some lady
don 't call me madam
some lover
Call me Mrs.
Thank you again for inviting us everything is great
we 're glad you came
I can 't remember the last time we laughed
you can really liven up the atmosphere
Hope to see you soon
you are lucky robert
hope you understand this
I know
- Good night
so how did you know
Heck I left marijuana in my pocket right?
Yes
That 's right
I knew something was wrong
You 've been weird the past few weeks
Then why do you smoke
for revenge
All right
I do not blame you
I am sorry
My wild ride is over
there will be no next time
- i have a question - what
why you want to try smoking marijuana
I thought it would be fun to break the rules
does this sound stupid
One point
My life feels like that stupid swan napkin
rigid tight crease sharp edges
People are envious but I work hard
so tiring
Of course
We all forgot to have fun in life
fun
I 'm content with laughing occasionally
I want to hear you laugh again
I 'm willing to break all the rules for this
I 'm starting to realize that you 're not the good girl I thought you were
Yes, sir
i 'm a rebellious girl
OK
we gotta do something tonight
crazy thing
crazy and funny
what can we do
I 'm so excited
Rob
we are too loud
Are you not a rebellious girl?
you are right
Mortuary If you visit your local mortuary you will find those who made the wrong choice
good man corpse
Some recklessly engage in extramarital affairs
Some recruit violent strangers into their homes
Others hide dark secrets from their lovers
Yes, it was the choice that made them die
But more importantly, murder
