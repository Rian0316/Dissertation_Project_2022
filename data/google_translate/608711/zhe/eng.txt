 Where 's Danny ?
 I don 't know . He disappeared just after we took off .
 Here he is .
 Right , listen , it 's been fun , hasn 't it ?
 All right and I 'm going to call you just like I promised I said I would .
 How 's your head ?
 That 's all right , I 'll call engineering .
 I 'll get that soap dispenser ... moved down a little bit . It 's dangerous , could have your eye out .
 Okay , got to go .
 Big kiss .
 There it is , go on .
 - Finished ?
 - Yeah , just having a flashback .
 - Ash , get us a car .
 - Right .
 So that 's where you disappeared to ?
 Well , there 's something about trolley dollies . It must be all that makeup .
 - Three hours ?
 - Oh , no .
 No , the last two , I was flying the plane .



 - Nice place .
 - Start as you mean to go on .
 Mick ?
 Look I don 't care if he does know the Chancellor ... the price is still nine million , non- negotiable .
 Hold .
 Yes ?
 There seems to be some confusion over the reservation .
 - There wasn 't one .
 - Janet ?
 Well , I called this morning to confirm .
 I 'm sure it was just an oversight .
 Our reservations clerk is new .
 So new in fact , she forgot to swipe your credit card .
 And you are ?
 I 'm the manager .
 - Yes , Nigel ?
 - Yes .
 Nigel , I will see to it right away .
 Well , if I could just take it --
 Excuse me . Yes , I 'm still here .
 Yes , and the price is still the same . Would you hold please ?
 Thank you for dealing with this matter personally , I will get right on it .
 Right .
 - Thank you .
 - No problem .
 Okay , let 's do what we do best .

 Let me get this straight .
 What you 're telling me is ... you 're going to take my 100, 000 in cash ... do your little share scam thing ... then bring me back half a million , in five days , is that right ?
 Guaranteed . But we 'll have to be quick .
 Crown Offshore find out that we 've manipulated their stock ... we 'll be dead in the water .
 Come on , think about it , Howard .
 A guaranteed minimum return of 500 % , no risk , no fuss .
 - It sounds fantastic .
 - It is .
 Your competitors will be sick when they find out ... how much money you 've made on the deal .
 And you 're willing to let me in ?
 First name on my list .
 Half a mil , one hit .
 - No questions asked .
 - I 've got a question .
 Shoot .
 Where on my forehead does it say cash dispenser ?
 - I 'm not with you .
 - Really ?
 Let me spell it out for you , as you 're clearly not the sharpest tool in the box .
 You tell me about this great deal you have .
 Guy on the inside , guaranteed returns , blah , blah , blah .
 I give you a grand , you give me four back . You with me so far ?
 I 'll take that as a yes . So now I 'm three grand up .
 Thank you very much , by the way .
 You 're three grand down , but you 're hoping that 's a good investment .
 Why ? Because giving me three grand should convince me to give you more .
 Let 's call it bait .
 You all right ?
 You look a bit peaky . Can I get you a drink or something ?
 No ? So .
 Now I give you a suitcase full of money , cash of course .
 After all , I can trust you , can 't I ?
 You 've already made me money .
 Only this time ... you disappear .
 Simple . Imaginative .
 What could go wrong ?
 Okay , that 's it . Deal 's off .
 Clear you don 't trust me .
 I suggest we call it a day .
 But my money 's here .
 No , I 'll find someone who appreciates what I 'm offering .
 I appreciate it , really I do . Please . Please take my money .
 Do your magic thing one more time .
 Okay , look , you 're £3, 000 to the good .
 Let 's just leave things as they are .
 No , let 's not .
 Give this to the police .
 Oh , no .
 What kind of welcome 's that ?
 The kind you get when you disappear without paying your tab .
 We thought you 'd be pleased to see us .
 My accountant said I should bar you until you pay up .
 - You 've got an accountant ?
 - Yes .
 So , you 're all barred .
 Okay , Eddie , if that 's the way you feel about it .
 - How about one last drink ?
 - For old times ' sake .
 Okay , one drink .
 Cheers , Eddie , bring them over .
 And put them on our tab .
 We got a lottery winner here .
 If you beat the odds of fourteen million- to- one ... you deserve to keep your money .
 Telecommunications boss gets golden handshake .
 Sorry .
 Hello ?
 Alice , Alice , Alice !
 God , yeah . Yeah , of course I remember .
 Yeah , mine is , too , it 's killing me .
 I can 't talk right now , sweetheart , ' cause I 'm , you know , I 'm just about to ....
 I 'm just about to go into theater .
 Yeah , all right , I 'll definitely call you back . Definitely .
 All right , goodbye .
 Bye .
 You 're a very sick man , Danny .
 Look at me , surrounded by angels .
 All right , this is your last drink , then you 're all barred .
 You really should work on your customer service , Edward .
 - You 're almost there .
 - I save that for paying customers .
 I suppose you 've heard about Harry .
 - Who ?
 - Harry Holmes , one of your lot , ain 't he ?
 - Old- time grifter .
 - Yeah , he 's one of the best .
 What happened , Harry .
 Seems he was taken for 30, 000 a few years back .
 He remembered the sequence .
 So he took you for the convincer , and then turned you in ?
 How much ?
 3, 000 .
 This is what I don 't get , right .
 Why didn 't he just pocket your three grand and , you know , let you walk away ?
 He loved it , you know ?
 Telling me how clever he was .
 Taped every conversation we had , then made a full statement .
 So who is he ?
 A young high flier called Howard Jennings .
 He 's a property broker . He finds land for the major developers to build on .
 Nasty piece of work .
 I really thought I had him .
 He 's obsessive , always one step ahead , has files on all his opponents .
 Checks everything out , nothing left to chance .
 A rival company snatched a large parcel of land ... from under his nose last month .
 Took a nine iron to his own desk .
 It 's like he needs a course in anger management .
 Made worse when they discovered a cache of old Roman coins during excavation .
 Worth a fortune , apparently .
 Made him a laughingstock .
 Sounds like it couldn 't happen to a nicer bloke .
 - Do you need anything ? - No .
 Thanks , Mickey , but I 'm fine .
 I appreciate you coming , though . Know it couldn 't have been easy .
 Mick , did you have to dress like that when you were inside ?
 - Drop it , Danny .
 - It was a joke .
 - A bad one .
 - Sorry , Mick , no offense .
 None taken .
 Listen , right , listen up .
 I say we take this Jennings bloke .
 - We can 't .
 - Why not ?
 - Tell him , Ash .
 - Well , he 's clued up .
 When some realize they 've been conned , they get obsessed by it .
 You know , research the subject .
 And if he knows enough to take convincer money off a good grifter like Harry ... that 's what he 's done .
 Which means they can 't be taken again .
 First rule of the con ... always stay one step ahead of the mark .
 Hang on a minute .
 I thought the first rule of the con was you can 't cheat an honest man .
 - It 's that , too .
 - Yeah , can he do that , Albert ?
 Can he just change the first rule when he wants ?
 You can 't con someone who knows when they 're being conned .
 You 're saying , this bloke 's too clever for us ?
 No , I 'm saying we play percentages .
 And if the mark knows the plays , it leaves us nowhere to go .
 Excuse me .
 No , idiot .
 Hello , gorgeous girl .
 Yes , I 'm with a patient .
 Who ?
 One of the passengers , that 's right .
 Yeah , it 's the turbulence in the air .... Sickness , nightmare .
 All right , yeah , I 'll call you , of course . Bye .
 Look .
 What 's the one thing you 've said to me more than anything else ?
 Apart from " Shut up , Danny . "
 Listen , now , everyone has a way in , all right , everyone 's got a weakness .
 Maybe he 's the exception that proves the rule .
 Maybe he 's not , okay ?
 A mark is a mark is a mark ... is a mark .
 All right , look , there 's no point doing all this Kung Fu , Grassyhopper stuff ...
 Mickey , with me , if you 're not going to let me put it to the test .
 Danny , the long con is a science .
 It 's about reason , covering all the angles , leaving nothing to chance .
 Yeah .
 But it 's also about having the bottle to go for it .
 Look any idiot can go for it .
 But a con artist takes the mark 's money ... and he doesn 't even know he 's been conned .
 Yeah , okay .
 But isn 't it also about gut instinct ?
 What 's Albert call it ?
 What do you call it , Albert ? Grift sense ?
 Most of all it 's about not taking unnecessary risks .
 All right . Let 's put it out . Let 's ask the others .
 Leave me out of it .
 Just pretend I 'm not here , all right ?
 Thanks a lot . Okay . Let 's let Albert decide .
 Well , on the surface , granted ... trying to con Jennings is a bad idea .
 But there 's another challenge here .
 Two styles of grifting .
 One reasoned , well thought out , as Mickey says , covering all the angles .
 The other more intuitive ... daring , relying on one 's ability to think on their feet .
 Which is the best ? Hard to say .
 They each have merits of their own .
 See ? I got merits .
 Of course , the true con has elements of both .
 That 's it , then , what Albert says . It 's a challenge .
 What ?
 We take the con . If it works , I win , and if it don 't , you do .
 - You don 't think that 's a little childish ? - No , Mickey .
 No , I don 't . Okay ?
 50p ?
 - What ?
 - 50p says that I can take him .
 - 50p .
 - Yeah , cash .
 To con the un- connable mark .
 Of course , if you 're too much of a girly wuss , Mickey ... a little bit too frightened to take the bet , we 'll just leave it right there .
 Okay , superstar . You have got yourself a bet .
 So we 're actually going to do this ?
 Well , it looks like it . Yeah .
 Tell them it 's non- negotiable .
 I want this loser sent down for whatever the maximum sentence is .
 He played the game , he lost . He pays the bill . End of .
 Very simple , just think .
 Think it through .
 Look , Danny .
 Why do you always have to go out on a limb , hey ?
 I just hear myself saying it , Ash , and then ... that 's it . I don 't know .
 Anyway , I 'm in it now .
 Need any help ?
 Me , no .
 No , thanks . No , I 've got it all sussed .
 I 'm just really , you know , going through those fine details .
 Details ?
 I know what you 're thinking .
 Do you ?
 You 're thinking the most important thing ... is to keep him away from the police , right ?
 Most marks don 't report a con ... because they think they 've done something illegal ... or better still , they don 't know they 've been conned in the first place .
 Yeah , that 's right .
 With Jennings , his reputation is the biggest thing .
 He has to be seen as top dog .
 Brilliant !
 Brilliant .
 It is .... Wow !
 That 's like you 're in my head .
 You 're probably thinking of a way to make him look stupid ... if he did go to the police , right ?
 Right .
 Something that might ruin his reputation , that sort of thing ?
 You know what ? That is really , really clever .
 Yeah , I scare myself sometimes .
 Okay , I 've got it ! Right , listen up .
 Briefing back here , one hour . Don 't be late . Thank you .
 Let 's make it two .
 You see , whatever we do has to be so outrageous ... that even if he knows he 's being conned , he ain 't going to go to the police ... because he 's going to look a prat .
 Right , I got the idea from Harry .
 You remember he said this Jennings bloke was miffed ...
 ' cause that other company found all them gold coins .
 - Yeah , and ?

 - And ... we sell him a piece of land ... but we make him believe there 's something under it .
 Such as ?
 I read about this museum exhibition --
 - You read something ?
 - Yes , thank you , Stacie . I can read .
 Thank you .
 Actually , Irish John told me about it .
 Right . The Jubilee collection .
 Gold artifacts dating back to the Bronze Age , found ... when they were extending the Jubilee line into the East End .
 Yeah , I heard about that .
 What they couldn 't work out was where all the gold came from .
 It suggested that the Bronze Age inhabitants ... of what would eventually become London ...
 - had a plentiful supply -- - Thank you , I was just about to say that .
 Hold on . Why couldn 't the gold have come from somewhere else ?
 There are more likely sites in the Mendips or Wales , but ... as the M4 wasn 't built for the next 5, 000 years , chances are it was mined locally .
 - Gold mine scam -- - Hello , thank you .
 - This is my con .
 - Wait a sec .
 We 're going to sell this guy a gold mine ?
 In Central London ?
 Why not ?
 This is going to be the easiest 50 pence I 've ever earned .
 Okay , yeah , all right . But don 't spend your money just yet ...
 ' cause that is the whole point .
 The more outrageous it is , the less ... he 's going to see it coming .
 Well , there 's a twisted logic in there somewhere .
 No , he 's got a point .
 You know , I mean ... who 'd be stupid enough to try and sell a fake gold mine ... in the middle of London ?
 There you go .
 Harry told me Jennings reads The Telegraph .
 So we mock up a copy for him .
 Now he must know about the collection , but let 's remind him .
 Phase two , the land itself .
 Ash has found us a place .
 15, 000 square feet , less than a mile from where the artifacts were found .
 Run as an old rag and bone yard for years .
 Now the old guy -- Thank you very much . The old man is retiring , so he 's willing to sell it to us .
 The agreement is we pay when we find a buyer .
 Okay , I say we sell it to Howard for twice what the land 's worth .
 We 'll pack the old boy off on holiday to Bognor Regis ... so he 's going to be out of our hair for two weeks .
 How do we convince the mark about the gold ?
 All we got to do is plant the seed .
 Just enough to get him to take a soil test ... and then get a gold expert in for evaluation .
 And he , of course , will be one of us .
 What do you think ?
 If it had any more holes , you could strain tea with it .
 Let 's be honest , mate , you 're just frightened of losing the bet .
 Okay .
 So what 's first ?
 - Ash , what about the office ?
 - We 'll be set up in a couple of days .
 Right . Then that leaves nothing more than for me to reel him in .
 - What ?
 - Problem ?
 Yes , Albert 's the roper .
 That 's how this works , we all do our own jobs .
 Albert ropes , Stacie 's the banker ...
 Ash is our fixer , and you and I play the inside .
 I know that , okay , and no offense , Albert , but we can 't do this one by the book .
 If Jennings knows all the moves , we 've got to invent new ones .
 No roper steering him to the inside man , no convincer .
 I 'm just going to dive straight in .
 Whoosh .
 Whoosh ?
 Trust me , he won 't know what 's hit him .
 What do you think ?
 It 's a disaster waiting to happen .
 Tell me I 'm wrong .
 I can 't .
 I think we should keep an eye on him .
 All right .
 Wish me luck .
 Wait , I 'll come with you .
 You don 't make life easy for yourself , do you , Danny ?
 It 'll work , Albert , all right . It will work , just trust me on it .
 - Anything is possible .
 - What , you think I 'm out of my depth ?
 Use that talent of yours and surprise us all .
 And remember , your first meeting with a mark is crucial .
 If you get off on the wrong foot ...
 - you 're beat from the start .
 - Right .
 Cold read him , learn everything you can ... before you say a word .
 Cold what ?
 You do know about cold reading ?
 Oh , cold reading . I know about cold reading . Yeah .
 Well , how about a little refresher course ?
 If we 've got time , I mean .... Yes , please .
 It 's really very simple . Follow me .
 What do you see ?
 Okay , right .
 - A bloke .
 - More specific .
 You 've got to convince him that you 're like- minded , like two peas in a pod ... that you could be his friend .
 Now to do that , you need to know who he is .
 To become a chameleon .
 Chameleon ?
 His name ... is Mark . Okay .


 All right , okay , seriously .
 Well he 's ... - he 's divorced ?
 - There you go .
 Maybe he 's not , though .
 He 's on a business trip . Could be here on the pull .
 - Not enough cologne .
 - Okay .
 What else ?
 Divorced . He sees his children on the weekends , at fast food restaurants .
 He has to pay a fortune for the maintenance and that 's left him ... tired and stressed .
 He probably didn 't cook before he left home .
 Consequently he 's lost weight recently .
 No way . I 'm not having that .
 Look at his socks . See ? Children .
 And his nails . See the stress ?
 His skin .
 That 's the fast food , yeah ?
 Okay , I 'm having all of this , but how you telling me he 's lost weight ?
 Look at his belt .
 See the line . He 's pulled it in a notch .
 Mark , how are you ?
 Have you lost weight recently ?
 How are your lovely children ?
 Thanks .
 She 's still got the hots for you .
 Is that so ?
 What , like you didn 't know ?
 This is the best crew I 've ever had , and I intend to keep it that way .
 And you think hooking up with Stacie would spoil that ?
 I know hooking up with Stacie would spoil that .
 Maybe you 'd better tell her .
 Guys , it 's all about staying one step ahead of the competition .
 - You see what you want and you just -- - Go for it .
 It 's not " go for it , " Nick . It 's " get it . "
 Yes , I mean , that 's what I meant .
 That site I had in Islington .
 83- year- old tenant blocking the deal .
 She wouldn 't move because she was worried her little cat ... wouldn 't find its way home .
 That 's wrinklies for you .
 So I ran over the cat , she signed within a fortnight .
 See what you want , grab it by the balls .
 Off you go .
 Glass of shampoo , squire .
 Oh , God , scenery 's nice , isn 't it ?
 Anyone tried to pull yet ?
 Nick was just about to try his luck , but he bottled it .
 I told you , she 's probably waiting for someone .
 Well , there is only one way to find out .
 50 quid says that I pull it .
 Okay , you 're on .
 - Yeah ?
 - Yeah .
 All right . Wish me luck .
 Not a chance .
 Hi .
 I 'm a bit nervous , listen , don 't worry I 'm not trying to pull you .
 My boyfriend would kill me . That 's a joke . All right .
 Seriously , it 's my mom 's birthday , and I love her , I adore her .
 I suppose what I 'm really looking for is a bit of womanly advice .
 Now , don 't cry .
 I had a girlfriend and I loved her but she dumped me on holiday .
 That 's all right , thank you .
 He seems to be doing all right to me .
 Could 've been you .
 - Fifty , weren 't it ?
 - Pay the man , Nicholas .
 You know what I always say , Nichol- ass ?
 You see what you want , you grab it by the balls .
 Tell you what , why don 't I buy you all a drink ?
 No thanks .
 We have to be getting back .
 - Howard ?
 - I think I 'll stay for one more .
 - See you back at the office , then .
 - Yeah , see you .
 I hate a bad loser , don 't you ?
 Absolutely . Howard Jennings .
 Paul Carrington .
 He loved it , you know ?
 Telling me how clever he was .
 Taped every conversation we had , then made a full statement .
 I really thought I had him .
 Let 's just leave things as they are .
 No . Let 's not .
 So , what do you do ?
 Property .
 - Property ?
 - Development , mostly .
 I find the land , you know , the boss flogs it to the highest bidder .
 - What 's the name of the company ?
 - Cityrise . You heard of it ?
 - No .
 - Based in Manchester .
 Just opened a London office .
 - And how 's business ?
 - It 's okay .
 So who do you work for , then ?
 I work for me .
 Now that is my dream .
 Tell old Golden Balls where to stick his job .
 Golden Balls ?
 You 'll know him soon enough . Going to blow away the competition , he says .
 Really ?
 Biggest in London in three years , he reckons .
 Anyway , it is time I was off .
 Listen , Howard .
 Can we do this again ?
 Yeah , maybe .
 Give my secretary a call .
 Shame .
 How you fixed for tomorrow ?
 Really , I 'm very busy . Nice to meet you though , Paul .
 I tell you what . Why don 't you swing over now ?
 Check out the new offices ? You can say hello to Golden Balls while you 're there .
 - Yeah , all right .
 - Great .
 I 'll just ring my secretary , tell her I 'm on my way .
 - Dorothy .
 - Dorothy ?
 No .
 - We 're not set up . We said tomorrow .
 - I was losing him ....
 - We have to go now . - Danny !
 There 's not enough time .
 Dorothy .
 Can you hear me ?
 - The line 's very .... - Danny .
 Okay , let 's go .
 Excuse me .
 Can I help you ?
 Don 't tempt me , darling .
 We 've come to give the second floor a once over .
 I thought you weren 't starting till tomorrow .
 Tomorrow ? Look .
 You ever done any painting and decorating , sweetheart ?
 - A bit .
 - Right , you ever heard of prepping ?
 - Well , I ....
 - God bless .
 I tell you what , you can come upstairs with us ... and give us both a hand , if you like .
 - I bet you 'd look great in a pair of overalls .
 - I 'm sure you 'll manage .
 He 's with me . Hold all my calls . Thank you .
 Right , this is the boss 's floor , more or less ...
 and here 's his office .
 - You 're late .
 - Yeah , sorry , business lunch .
 - I brought someone back with me .
 - Yeah , who ?
 This is my boss Martin Stuart .
 Martin this is ....
 Howard Jennings .
 So , you 're Jennings ?
 You 've heard of me , then ?
 James Harrison is due here in 10 minutes , we 'll need his portfolio .
 Well , I 'll go and dig it out then , shall I ?
 You 're about all I have heard since I 've been down here .
 That 's because this is my city .
 There 's not a patch of undeveloped land in London that I don 't know about ... and have first refusal on .
 If that 's true , I guess I 'll be out of a job soon .
 You said it .
 Is that what you 've come to tell me ?
 Pretty much .
 Actually , I doubt we 're in competition .
 You buy and sell land , so do I.
 Yes , but mine 's more specialized .
 Specialized ?
 So if you 'll excuse me , I do have some work to be getting on with .
 I 'll get Paul to show you out .
 ... Harrison 's file on my desk now .
 Show Jennings out .
 Howard .
 - Well , it was a pleasure meeting you .
 - Yeah , next time make an appointment .
 You should be ashamed of yourself .
 How did it go ?
 It was a piece of cake .
 - We weren 't even set up .
 - What ?
 - He brought the mark back with him .
 - I had a chance and I grabbed it .
 What if we couldn 't have got set up in time ?
 Mickey , I had faith in you , didn 't I ?
 - Where 're your socks ?
 - Here 's one of them .
 Sorry , Danny , but it does seem a bit messy .
 Messy ?
 Usually we have it all worked out . You know , a proper plan .
 Listen , gang . Listen up . We have got a plan .
 Okay , we 've got a plan . All up here .
 You 've no idea how frightening that is , have you ?
 You just got to trust me , haven 't you ?
 What next , then ?
 Well , I 'm working on that one .
 What 's the first thing the mark would do ?
 Well , he 'd ....
 What would you do ?
 Right . Don 't tell me .
 You can almost hear the cogs turning .
 Research Cityrise . Ash , please set up a web site .
 I was just about to say that .
 Ash , go and search the thing .
 I was just about to say that , Mickey .
 All right , troops , everyone listen up .
 Tomorrow . Ash , get the yard ready .
 Stacie , I want you down the museum . Albert , you 're our gold expert .
 - Mickey , get yourself off to the bank .
 - What for ?
 Get your 50p out .
 Do you ever have the feeling we 've created a monster ?
 All the time .
 Right .
 How far away ?
 Remarkable examples , aren 't they ?
 Do you work here ?
 I 'm in charge of the Bronze Age .
 Well , not the Bronze Age as such , I mean , that 's a period of time .
 That would make me a queen , and a time traveler , at that .
 No , I 'm actually in charge of the artifacts that hail from the period .
 And these are my crowning glory .
 One of the great mysteries of London .
 It seems a bit far- fetched , that there 's a gold mine in London somewhere .
 No , not really .
 The landscape was very different 6, 000 years ago , after all .
 No , it 's perfectly feasible .
 In actual fact , we have a professor of geology here in the museum ... who 's writing a paper on it .
 Really ?
 Where do I find this professor ?
 I 'm a philanthropist , I invest in scientific studies .
 In that case , I 'm sure he 'd be happy to talk to you .
 Let me write down his number .
 It says here the original mine would be worth millions .
 Indeed .
 I doubt what you see here represents even 1 % of what was actually there .
 Of course , the site has almost certainly been built on by now , so ... we 'll never know , will we ?
 I 've written my number on the other side .
 Enjoy the rest of your visit .
 The Saxon village reconstruction is excellent .
 You don 't think Danny 's going to pull this off , do you ?
 No .
 But you 're letting him try anyway ?
 He thinks what we do is easy . Won 't hurt to bring him down a peg or two .
 And win the bet in the process ?
 To the victor the spoils .
 Hello ?
 According to my notes , Howard ....
 May I call you Howard ?
 Yes .
 It 's widely believed that most gold deposits , particularly ... of the volcanic and sedimentary variety ... were formed from circulating ground waters ... driven up by magma .


 But , of course , it could also be expelled from the magma itself as it cooled .
 - And this could happen in London , right ?
 - Oh , yes .
 No reason not , although geologically speaking ...
 - conditions aren 't ideal .
 - But is it possible ?
 Oh , yes , there are certain residues ... that have been around for thousands of years .
 And how could you find out if you thought you had land with gold in it ?
 A multitude of ways , mostly by a simple soil test .
 Soil test ?
 So I could bring you some soil ... and you could tell from that whether there was gold underground ?
 No , I have to have further tests for that .
 But I could determine that the possibility was there .
 How accurately ?
 It depends on the size of the deposit .
 80 , 90 % , possibly .
 You hold such a piece of land ?
 No , not yet .
 But if I did , would you be prepared to do this test for me ?
 Yes , of course . If the Museum has no objection ...
 I 'd be happy to help .
 What you talking about ? I don 't need all this . I don 't need all this .
 Yes .
 Just do it , all right , do it .
 Cute , isn 't it ?
 All right , mate , how you doing ? What 's up ?
 Basically , Nick doesn 't know it yet , but he 's leaving us .
 So his job 's up for grabs . I just thought you might be interested .
 50K a year , double that with your commission ... nice car , relocation allowance .
 Lovely . Yeah , I am listening .
 Only trouble is I 'm just not sure you 're right for it .
 I 'm not sure I want to work for you .
 Don 't take offense , Paul .
 It 's more about what kind of deals you 're used to handling .
 I mean , with Martin , what 's the biggest deal you 're doing ?
 Do I look like a Muppet ?
 - Pardon ?
 - You 're just trying to nick all our clients .
 All right , well .
 You can 't blame a chap for trying , can you ?
 Okay , look , just talk me through one of your deals .
 I mean ....
 Martin was talking about one the other day .
 What was it ?
 The Jubilee deal ?
 - You know about that ?
 - A little . So what is it ?
 All I know ... all I know , is that we 've been hired to buy a parcel of land ... regardless of price .

 - By who ?
 - That I don 't know .
 Martin 's very secretive about it .
 Which usually means that he wants to take all the credit .
 Do you know where the land is ?
 It 's owned by an old rag and bone merchant .
 We 've offered him twice what it 's worth in cash , but he ain 't having any of it .
 Cash ?
 Yes , he hates banks .
 It 's a shithole .
 That 's what I don 't get . I mean , look at it .
 Barely going to get two houses in there , are you ?
 I mean , it ain 't that far from the Jubilee line , granted .
 But , I don 't know , the boss seems very keen to pay way over the odds for it .
 Right , can you get me in to see the owner ?
 What 's in it for me ?
 The job we discussed earlier .
 No .
 Look .
 I don 't know what you 're up to , all right .
 I don 't know , I don 't care .
 But , you cut me in and then maybe , you know ... maybe I 'll suddenly start thinking about it .
 I like you , Paul , you remind me of me .
 So ?
 Yeah , you 've got yourself a deal . Set up a meeting .
 ... all I know , is that we 've been hired to buy a parcel of land ... regardless of price .
 ... regardless of price .
 - Got to you the other day , didn 't it ?
 - What ?
 - Going to see Harry in prison .
 - Yeah , a little .
 In which case , you 've got a problem .
 You know this is going to go pear shaped , don 't you ?
 The kid 's gone off 100 miles an hour .
 Little or no groundwork , no convincer , no Plan B.
 Come on , give him credit , he 's played it well so far .
 Come on , Mick . You know as well as I do .
 There 's a huge gulf between setting up a long con ... and actually walking away clean .
 I know .
 Which means you 've got a decision to make .
 Which is ?
 If it 's going down the pan , do you bail him out ?
 Or do you let him fail , to teach him a lesson and win the bet ?
 Even if that means you going back to prison .
 Hello .
 Howard .
 Yeah , the land 's worth 210 .
 I think Martin 's latest offer was 420 .
 Yeah . 450 should do it .
 Okay .
 What time ?
 Yeah , that 's fine , I 'll be there .
 All right , bye .
 We 're on .
 Hello ?
 Mr. Jennings . Yes , hi .
 At 10 : 30 .
 And the address ?
 Right . I 'll be there . Bye .
 Hello ? Howard ? Okay , sure .
 No problem .
 And the address ? Fine .
 That 's weird .
 Why does he want everyone there ?
 Well , I told you , didn 't I ? He 's a control freak .
 Okay . No problem .
 Ash . Go get set up .
 Better get your 50p ready .
 - Right , you set ?
 - Yeah .
 Okay , 10 minutes .
 This doesn 't feel good .
 It 's Danny 's call .
 Howard .
 How are you ?
 Thought I 'd better bring some security . There 's a lot of money in here .
 All right , lads , welcome .
 Here he is , Colin .
 This is the man I was telling you about . Mr. Jennings .
 This is Colin Nash .
 I 'm pleased to meet you , Mr. Nash .
 You look like a man who 's prepared to drive a hard bargain .
 Yeah , rats .
 - Really ?
 - I ain 't got long .
 A man after my own heart .
 He tells me you 're willing to beat the other bloke 's offer .
 Indeed , yes , there 's a contract here .
 And the money 's in here . In cash .
 I understand you don 't like banks .
 No , leeches .
 I couldn 't agree more .
 So how much you got in there , then ? £450, 000 .
 It 's time .
 Be careful .
 So , do we have a deal ?
 Absolutely . Just one condition .
 That I carry out a soil test .
 Soil test ?
 It 's company policy .
 Thank you for coming .
 - I 'm not exactly sure why I 'm here .
 - Who are they ?
 They 'll be carrying out the tests .
 No one said nothing about no soil test .
 No soil test , no deal .
 Yeah , well hurry up , then , like I said ...
 I ain 't got all day .
 I 've got everything I need here , it wouldn 't take long .
 In your own time .
 I don 't get it .
 What exactly are you looking for ?
 You 'll see .
 Well ?
 Are you sure ?
 Definite traces of gold .
 It 's my belief there was an underground stream here at some point ... skirting the main source and bringing the particles up to the surface .
 See ?
 Excellent .
 - So do we have a deal ?
 - It would seem so .
 Just one more bridge to cross and then we can sign .
 What bridge ?
 Okay .
 Howard , if you 're messing me about , I 'll go .
 The thing is , Paul ... it occurred to me this might all be part of some elaborate con .
 - Con ?
 - Surely you 've heard of a confidence trick .
 For example , say you were all part of the same gang ?
 How would I know ?
 I haven 't met any of you until this week .
 So for me to part with a briefcase full of cash ... to people I 've known for less than a week ... would be pretty stupid , wouldn 't it ?
 And I 'm not .
 Stupid , that is .
 So I thought I 'd better get some insurance .
 You see , the Professor has just told me there are gold deposits here .
 Gold ?
 That 's right , yes , your boss was very secretive , wasn 't he ?
 Although you knew where the land was and how much he 'd offered .
 So now I do my own tests .
 And if they don 't find anything ... five minutes after you 've assured me there was gold ... then I 'd have to assume you were about to con me .
 No one leave .
 When they don 't find gold , I 've got a feeling he 's going to be very pissed off .
 So if you tell me which way you 're going to run ...
 I can make sure we don 't bump into each other .
 Shit .
 - I really hope Danny 's got a Plan B. - And C.
 What 's all this , then ?
 Won 't take long .
 - Vermin .
 - Are you quite finished ?
 Have to burn them .
 Hey , what the bloody hell 's all this ?
 Do you know I thought you might make an appearance .
 Paul ?
 This is my deal .
 - You have no idea what you 're doing .
 - Look .
 Mr. Jennings has topped your offer , it 's been accepted .
 Get over it .
 You 're fired .
 You just happened to be passing , I take it ?
 No . I wasn 't just passing . Dorothy told me he was here .
 We 've done the deal .
 I 'm here to make another offer .
 Mr. Nash , now , I have another offer that I really think you should consider .
 Boss .
 Okay .
 We 're screwed .
 I take it he got Albert to do a test first .
 How did you know that ?
 That 's the only way he 'll know for certain if it 's a con .
 So what are we going to do ?
 Looks like you 've got yourself a deal , Mr. Nash .
 If you could sign there .
 Thank you very much , Mr. Nash .
 Looks like you 've been pipped at the post , Golden Balls .
 Sorry about all that other stuff , but you never know who to trust .
 Paul , about the job . I 've decided to keep Nick on after all .
 Sorry .
 Can someone explain to me what just happened ?
 - He found gold .
 - How ?
 Well I guess the Jubilee site had to be somewhere .
 But that means this place could be worth millions ... and we just flogged it to him for a poxy 450K .
 You win some , you lose some .
 That was intense .
 Let 's get out of here .
 I just still don 't get it .
 It would have been a terrible , terrible thing .
 But .... Strangely ....
 My sex life would have been a terrible thing .
 Do you know I could get used to this .
 A quiet Danny .
 Silence is golden .
 Having a good laugh , are you ?
 Everybody having a good laugh ?
 Okay , where 's my 50p ? And I want a letter .
 - A letter ?
 - Yes , I want a letter signed by you ... apologizing for underestimating me and stating uncategorically ... that I 'm the better grifter .
 You lot can witness it . Eddie , paper on the bar , squire . Thank you .
 I 'd happily do that , Danny . If you 'd won the bet .
 - Did we sell the land or not ?
 - Yes .
 - Yeah , is the money in the case or not ?
 - Yes .
 Yeah , then pay up .
 No , but the bet was which is the best style ... your unstructured , undisciplined , fly- by- the- seat- of- your- pants ...
 let 's- all- go- to- jail madness masquerading as a long con ... or my professional , reasoned , covering - all- the- angles , never- get- caught style .
 Bollocks .
 - And that 's your argument , is it ?
 - No , my argument is the con worked ...
 - and you should pay up .
 - But the con was falling apart .
 We still got paid .
 But only because I was watching your back .
 - What ?
 - Tell him Ash .
 No , you leave me out of this .
 You hadn 't covered all the angles , so I had to do it for you .
 How did you do that ? I didn 't hear you say a word .
 I didn 't have to .
 - You remember Ash firing his gun ?
 - Yeah .
 He didn 't actually shoot anything .
 - All right , so the rat died of a heart attack .
 - Actually ... it was one I prepared earlier .
 - What do you mean ?
 - He simply fired into the ground .
 Why ?
 Because he 'd filled the cartridges with gold .
 All he had to do was aim at the spot where the sample was about to be taken ... and fire , peppering the soil with gold .
 - So there weren 't any gold ?
 - No .
 Only what we put there .
 Sorry , only what I put there to cover your ass .
 Experience , science , Danny .
 Covering all the angles .
 Not going off half- cocked .
 So I win the bet .
 Yeah , well ....
 Whatever .
 Call it a draw , all right ?
 No , now wait a minute ... if I hadn 't bailed you out , the whole thing would have gone pear shaped .
 If it weren 't for me , we wouldn 't have been there in the first place .
 - You owe me 50p . Pay up .
 - No , no you pay up .
 - But I won .
 - No , you didn 't win .
 You didn 't win . We made a case full of money because of me .
 No , because of me , you mean .
 - What about the web site ?
 - I was going to do that .
 I arranged for Albert to give you a lesson in cold reading .
 What , cold reading ? I knew that stuff already .
 No , you did not .
 Looks like it 's going to be a long night .
 Yes , shall we leave them to it ?
 Why don 't you just admit it , I beat you fair and square ?
 Why don 't you just admit it , all right ?
 You were going to walk away , I made us a case full of money .
 - I do hate sore losers .
 - Do you ?
 Double or quits .
 - What ?
 - I 've got this great idea .
 - Oh , no .
 - No , bear with me . Pigeons .
 - Pigeons ?
 - Pigeons , yeah .
 Pigeons . I read all about them . They 're worth a fortune .
 Can you paint a pigeon ?
 - I 'm not even listening . - No .
 'Cause you know I 'm right .
 Shut up , Danny .
