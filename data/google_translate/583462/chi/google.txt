Handsome guy, how are you?

Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent light
How good can I be?
ask you a question
You don 't currently have a date, do you?
I met someone who is perfect for you
Perfection may be an issue
If you speak of mutual independence or self-destruction . . .
Want a date on Saturday?
Of course, please
He 's handsome and funny, he . . .
he ?
Oops, I thought . . .
You are a promising young man
Okay, Shirley, I 'm going to the toilet to flush myself
goodbye

I 'm not in the mood to eat noodles after listening
Isn 't that absurd? Can you believe she would think that way?
When I first saw you, I thought you were you. Do you really think so?

Yeah, but then you 've been staring at my boobs at Phoebe 's birthday party I guess you 're not
That 's what you thought when you first saw me? I was

Director: James Burrow
- i don 't think - me too
Although Susan in college thought so
What are you kidding?
Did you tell her I wasn 't? No
No, because I want to date her too
I told her you and Bernie were a couple
Because he likes her too
This is simply amazing
what is the reason ?
I have no idea
because you 're smart and funny
Ross is also smart and funny
Have you ever thought about him? Yes
Why exactly?
I can 't even tell
But you just have that tune
That 's right
Tune? Well said
I 'm also worried that you can 't see it
Rachel, it 's Paul calling from Rome.
God, calling from Rome

(Italian)
Great, he 's calling from Rome and so can I
I 'm going to Rome
Monica, it 's from your dad
Can you make a long story short?
i 'm on the phone with rome

Dad, what 's the matter?
Oh my God
Ross, it 's grandma
how are you ?

How is her condition?
The doctor said only a few hours left
Mom, are you okay? Me? I 'm okay
nice to see you here
What 's wrong with your hair? What?
It looks a little different. Nothing has changed.

Maybe that 's why
she is unbelievable
relax
Looks like we 're gonna have to stay here for a while
Inevitably have to talk about your boyfriend and work
my God
It 's disgusting that she has moldy coins in her purse
Do you know what I like?
her artificial bag of candy
she always steals from the restaurant
Not just a restaurant, our home too
Mrs Grey
she looks so small

I know at least she has grandpa and aunt to accompany her now
goodbye, grandma
goodbye grandma
Ross
Nurse
What 's wrong?
The nurse said she was dead, but it wasn 't
what? she 's not dead yet
she 's alive, she 's back
what happened ?
- she may be dead - she may be dead ?
we also want to know
I 'll go in and see
It 's almost impossible for this to happen
she passed away
i have to know
is my hair ?
yes, it 's your hair
you have gay hair
How is she?
twice
twice ?
how are you ?
Can 't tell, it 's so weird
I know she 's gone but I feel like . . .
Maybe it 's because she hasn 't
no, she died
we checked
many times
Maybe people don 't really die
After my mom died, I sometimes felt like she was by my side
And Dai, my best friend from middle school got hit by lightning while playing mini golf
I always feel a strong 'telepathy' with that yellow pencil
i miss her so much
Come, Fei, do you want it?
Thank you, you 're welcome, I just cut it this morning
I don 't believe this set
death is death
When it dies, it becomes food for worms
Chandler looks like a gay ?
I don 't know who this person is but it 's definitely not Debbie
I thought it was going to be a sealed coffin
That doesn 't mean she can 't look decent
Do you think you can go in, kid? Of course you can

my braces
I 'm thinking about when I go, Dad
listen to me
I 'm going to be buried at sea when I go
what ?
I want to be buried at sea
It seems interesting
define it
You 'll have a great time that day
You will be on the boat with lunch . . .
And then throwing your corpse into the sea is fun
Everyone thinks they know me
They all say that Jack is too immutable
Maybe they 'll say sea burial when I die, huh?
They 'd probably say that
hope so
Beauty
- I 'm sorry about yesterday - don 't worry
Trust me, apparently others have made the same mistake


- Do you think it 's my fault? - I can 't tell.
You just have that tune, yeah

It 's a pity because you and Rolle would have been on good terms.
Rolle? Rolle of the Accounting Department
Do you think we are a good match?
why not? he 's handsome
he 's not like Brian

Is Brian . . ?
The point is if you want to pair me up I hope you 'll pick him
I don 't think you 're good enough for Brian
I am sorry
Do you think I am unworthy of him?
because i deserve him
Trust me
I really don 't deserve it
this one ?
no
I 've shown you every dress
Unless you want her to wear lemon yellow trousers and fuchsia forever
No matter what we choose, she 'll say we 're wrong
That 's right, choose purple.
Good choice, I 'm coming out
Wait, I 'm still short of shoes
How is this pair?
This is a pair of sun shoes
Will everyone dress more formally where she goes?
Can I find shoes with thinner heels?
I can 't find fuchsia evening shoes
But a pair of silver shoes might be suitable
No, it has to be purple
Unless we find another suit no, wait
Let me see
Maybe later
gosh
Are you all right, kid?
It 's alright, just grandma 's stuff
How are you? Are you ready?
Mom called me this morning and told me not to tie my hair
Did you know that my ears are not my prettiest part?
sometimes i think it is
Sorry, I 'm late
I can 't find my 'ear ring'
you mean your earrings ?
What did I just say?
Are you wearing this pair?
Yes, Paul sent it from Italy
We don 't sell shoes here?
Good morning, are you ready to go?
Don 't we all look better when we 're neatly dressed?
humanlike
The ceremony just now was simple and grand, wasn 't it?

come here, heart
It 's time for you to use a night cream
What 's up ?

nothing, your coat is noisy
Look, Giants vs. Cowboys

Do you watch football at the funeral ?
No, the game hasn 't started
I 'm going to watch the game at the reception
you are a bad person
no, paul gave me new shoes
Hope it 's not broken
Are you OK ?
what a beautiful day
what? i mean the weather

yes, air, trees
Even though grandma is dead it 's like . . .
Ross, are you okay? Ross...
i 'm fine
It 's just that my worst nightmare has finally come true
don 't worry i just see if you have muscle cramps
What 's up ?
One of your belts perforated
is spasm
come on kid
I use this all the time when I bruise
Mom, thank you
Sorry, my name is Andora Dorothy 's daughter
My name is Chandler and I don 't know who Dorothy is
see who shows up
how do you feel ?
Feel much better. . .


those pills really work
Yes, not the first two but the later two
i love you all
You are the best i love my sister

I love Philip

Chandler, I love you
Listen, if you want to be gay, be gay
I do not care
you 're right
Rachel
i love you
Do you know who I love the most? I don 't know
you
I do not understand
what is that ?
I have a hard hearing
How much is the ratio?
Giants lead 17-14
3 minutes left in the third quarter
great
Phil, can you get me a biscuit?
Your grandma must not like it
Of course, this is her funeral
What I heard was 'Why don 't I have ham in syrup?'
or 'I don 't buy enough flowers'
If I buy too much she will say
'Why spend so much money I don 't need to spend when I die'
Tone like grandma
Know what it 's like to live with someone who criticizes your every word?
I can imagine
Tell you that I will be a positive and optimistic person
what a miracle
mom, tell me
If you could do it all over again, would you tell her if she was here at this time?
tell her what?
how she drives you crazy picky about everything like your hair

I don 't understand what you 're talking about
Don 't you think telling the truth will improve the situation?
do not think so
I think some things are better not to say
Home and everything
some more wine, my dear.

You look so pretty in these earrings
thanks, you gave me
Actually it 's grandma
so sad
sadder than before
Who is this bare ass?
that person is me
look at that little thing
Yes, that 's my little brother

Can you be more mature?
who are those people ?
But I 've been asked
The one in the middle is grandma
Let me see
Me and you guys at Joe 's house in Java
Monica you look exactly like your grandma
How old was she then?
1 9 3 9 years ... 39 years
24 or 25 years old
They seem to be having a good time
watch . . . bare-ass Monica
Let me see
no, it 's me

I 'm trying new things
Lowe
Chandler
How is the accounting department?
just a mess
And you ?
very good
I don 't know how Shirley told you about me
But I 'm not (gay).

I know, that 's what I told her
real ?
Can you see it?
Nine out of ten
We have some kind of . . . radar
So you think I don 't have that kind of tune
Speaking on behalf of gay men, I have to say no
By the way, your friend Brian, he is
he is ?
And you don 't deserve him
I don 't deserve him
i can get goin if i want
hello Brian
the end of the play
thanks for watching
