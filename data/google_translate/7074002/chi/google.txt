'Breaking Lawyer' Season 4 Episode 3



Then say if I told you to switch hands on this thing
Each of us can get at least 4,000 yuan
This guy 's name is Happy Ronin
Simple and easy to find
I got it at the pawnshop on Fourth Avenue for twenty bucks but he has a cousin named Bavarian Boy
Almost the same umbrella, the same look as him
That stuff is worth the money
You should know the whereabouts of the Bavarian boy
I do know he 's eating ashes on a shelf in an office in San Mateo God knows how long he 's been there
They don 't know his worth
It 's not a Bavarian boy for them
They think it 's just broken stuff from grandmothers
I 'm sorry to throw it away
Then you 'll use the place I 'm talking about
Not as defensive as you say
no camera or anything
There 's an alarm on the door, and I should be able to handle it. After that, you 'll pick a lock.
go to the shelf
Then use the ronin to tune the boy
Up to five minutes to refill? Gentlemen
ok thanks Fran
thank you so cute
- isn 't it - yes, the food is coming to Mike
They can 't find the package.
When they see the shelf, they just think it 's a piece of shit they 've seen for years
You can 't catch us by reselling these things without a number.
You 're sending Price or the other gangsters to Dallas next week. There 's a collector 's fair going on there.
those people want hummel
when they see what we bring
sure to be eye-popping
they will spend big
By then we will be five or five
perfect right?
We coaxed an old lady who liked figurines into a happy mood
then make a fortune
do something good
how did you find this precious doll

does it matter
The people in the office messed with you and misunderstood you.

You got the point wrong
It 's not worth it, it 's not worth it
no you will pick it up

don 't do why
Not suitable for me
not for you

Am I missing something?
Is it difficult to drop the bag?

I don 't think it 's for you either

I 'm sorry about your brother
Thank you, are you really not with me?

For us to draft a contract for the target bank
The goal is when performing due diligence
get the contract ready
Do I need to start drafting the contract after this talk is over?
thank you
I 'll write the first draft and you 'll proofread
Well you have the final say
I think so
I found an opportunity while researching a competitor
They don 't have market share but . . .
And that 's important, there 's a rush over there on Walker Ridge.
I agree
They stumbled when the market adjusted
They are vulnerable and they know it
We take this into consideration as we prepare our plans . . .

Very happy to see you
I heard you came to say hello Look at you like a chick with a broken wing
It doesn 't matter, it doesn 't hurt, it 's just annoying.

Hello Viola Kevin Wachtel welcome to join
Nice to meet you
Kim I want to say
My condolences on Charles McGill
Everyone knows that I had a holiday with him
But he shouldn 't end up like this
I have to ask if James is okay
he 's coming out
He and his family are really grateful
The flowers you brought for the funeral would be nice
Kevin, we 're going to talk to the board at noon today.
Discuss Kim 's proposal together so . . .
No, no, I won 't delay you.

there 's one more thing
won 't take too long
Kim, you gotta go see those models
Model



Stunning
look at
This building has a full glass side on a north-facing lot
They say it saves energy
I am excited
Is this Salt Lake City?
Provo built it, might as well build it in Salt Lake City
and
- Cheyenne, Wyoming - Yes
And here is North Platte, Nebraska.
These two you already know this building is going to be built in Ogden, Utah
This one is on the Tucumcari side
And a couple of new Sedonas
Pueblo, Colorado, did you know it 's just the tip of the iceberg?
I still want to build it in Las Vegas after that.
Reno, Nevada
Lubbock Amarillo, Texas
San Antonio El Paso
Then we 'll move into Bend, Oregon, Boise, Pacific Northwest
Eugene Salem all the way to Portland
This is pretty special Denver

We 're going to plant a few trees on the west side

Is there anything wrong with Kim?
Not too much to see
Expanding so fast

Applying for a Federal Franchise
Yeah, we 're really building a business
Your hard work has paid off
gold is what it means
I 'll send it to you today for the record
Yes, ok
when will you give me the manuscript
You decide




Actually you were right
You try to write one first and then I read it again
no problem
I started writing after I took you home
Don 't take me home and take me to court, okay?

I didn 't know you were going to court today
That way I 'll be prepared in advance. I 'm not going to court.
- you 're not in court - there 's nothing to prepare, don 't worry
yes no
No, no, that dog can 't

I did a deal with him yeah
over and over again
just once
That 's right


I guess it 's not clear
- he didn 't say - what happened
he doesn 't believe
Is it that he doesn 't believe it or you are not committed enough to call me
this won 't work
The key is not to directly contact
Just give me your phone

take it
hey i 'm the one who intends
I have a question for you do you pull gold
The answer is yes or no do you pull gold?
can 't be, that 's fine
Because unless there 's a big nugget now
going through your bowels
You won 't be able to make such easy money anymore
How often can you pick a yale pin lock
Okay, you can make four thousand in eight minutes
It takes ten minutes for you to pick your nose
No one will trouble you after you go in and out
how does it sound

within half an hour
no problem

Look I don 't want to teach you how to do things but



Okay, Mr. McGill is all done. Thank you very much. See you next time. Hope she gets better soon.
sorry for letting go

Alright, not dead
you 're awake

And this handsome bald guy is O negative blood
All right
I can 't get that bullet out of your shoulder.
Metal detectors may be triggered in the future
gave you a broad-spectrum antibiotic
come see the situation
normal pulse
Now the sniff test says you should
Not being shot through the gut is only possible
I can 't fully guarantee that there are no cuts on it
If you miss it later
You 're going to suffer the worst infection of your life
It hurts to death, not to mention you will lose your life
so i advise you
Find a doctor who can do imaging
In other words, a doctor who doesn 't practice behind a garage
before that
keep dry and clean
Change bandages daily . . .
will you be alright

very good

Also, let me explain one more thing
I don 't want to see you again after I leave here
never want to
I 've had enough of this shit about drug cartels, hear?

















it 's me
can we talk
i just wanna go home
ok thank you
I just want to say
sorry to make you angry
I didn 't mean to make you sad
I was thinking
Baby that 's the best quality
So what do you want?
You say I 'm too flippant
don 't care about others
But that 's a very, very expensive vacuum
Suction is always so strong
So just because I bought you a present
so i can only sleep in the office linnett
linnett damn





Hello, are you still delivering food now?

Just a large portion of cheese

Two Garden Dressings and One Garlic Tomato Dressing





how are things
listen listen
What 's up with the guy in the office?
He 's here for the night, buddy, come pick me up or else... you come pick me up
Now if you take out that book that comes with
Instruction Manual
You will see a table divided into four pieces
I call it the time management matrix
The key words here are 'importance' and 'urgency'
Importance basically comes from yourself
Importance is that your value system is best based on principles
Importance is your task . . .
Importance . . .
- Your Core Strategy - Compete . . .
to achieve the primary goal . . .
- Urgency . . . - . . . and plans to implement the strategy
The urgency comes from the surrounding environment . . .
pressure on you
It 's getting closer in front of your eyes
And it 's also common that it can go deep . . .


















son of a bitch



- Urgent looking. . . - Omg need a quick response
You need to discern what 's really important in life
so I. . .
stop stop stop
no no
hey, nothing 's wrong
stop soon stop

I didn 't say it was easy
The car is great
I don 't know how you did it
At least it worked, right?

Hey
People in Salamanga were attacked

Yesterday on their way back with the goods
do you know who did it?

Varga was still breathing but he didn 't see his face
- someone knows about our business - it 's possible
This attack is like
Hector 's truck a few months ago
And they know that people in Salamanga are not vegetarian

If you feel like we 're exposed . . .
Load up the car, let 's wait and see

Do not ship until you are sure

How long will the goods last

no more than a week

This is a problem

Find a local supplier on your side

Mr Juan pardon my offense

He made it clear that I came to think of Eladio 's way.

Mr Flynn
I didn 't know you were coming
Hope it didn 't bother you
no no
I 'm just making gadgets
what is that
Technical stuff is boring oh no
Well
Did you know that salt dissolves in water?
If stirring or heating the water
dissolves more salt than it should
without precipitation
I 'm trying to create a solvent like that
It just contains benzodiazepine precursor compounds
sounds great
If it works, it would be awesome


yes i tested your sample







Purity between 39 and 58 percent
Except for this one it 's about sixty-seven
That 's pretty good, so you 'd better call a chemist
Check his or her 'cooker' for contamination that can easily be avoided
Many thanks Gail
this information is very useful
I won 't disturb you
Mr Flynn
I don 't want to slander others
but i have to tell you
These samples are not good
In fact
not even good
basically garbage
I can do better than this
- Gail - much purer than that
I can make more than a kilo here
No one knows how many days it will be made
I don 't want to disturb your research work
This is my research work
please this is what i should do
I will not let you down
you must not
But I 'm afraid I can 't agree not for now.
You have a greater mission and we 'll see you soon Gayle bye Mr. Flynn

Look what the old guy said
Well see for yourself
don 't go it 's okay
You also want to know what he wrote
yes if you can

no date
Okay, let 's start
'Dear Jimmy
Over the years for our relationship
I have a lot of words to say
instead of letting . . .
Let these unspoken thoughts go away with me
I 'd rather write them down for you
I hope you don 't twist the meaning of my words
accept them correctly'

start a new line
'I still remember clearly
The day you came home from the hospital
You can 't imagine the joy on your mother 's face
Frankly I 've never seen
She looks as happy as that day
You brought an unprecedented light into her life
I 'm happy about it'
start a new line
'We always disagree
I guess it will be the same in the future
But nothing can change
The fact that we are brothers and blood relatives even though we are completely different people I still want you to know how much I admire
What you 've accomplished over the last few years, you 've grown up with my opportunity to put you in the mailroom
Became an important member of the law firm family and despite your past problems I am still proud that you are my brother'

'I admire your energy and resilience from the bottom of my heart
I used to worry about whether you could make a living in this world
But I don 't worry anymore I 'm pretty sure now whatever the future holds
You will all be successful I hope when you read this letter you remember me not just your brother
And someone who will always support you'
Signed 'Chuck', don 't tell me this guy can really write letters
Feel sorry
- No I didn 't mean to . . . - It 's okay it 's okay this letter is well written No . . .
leave me alone
gold
