 And ?
 What if I told you , you could turn this into 4 grand ?
 For each of us .
 Minimum .
 This little fella , he 's called the " Merry Wanderer . " He 's not much to look at , he 's easy to find . I got this one at a pawnshop for 20 bucks .
 But he has a cousin called " Bavarian Boy . "
 Almost identical .
 Same umbrella , same swagger .
 That one is worth a boatload .
 And I gather you know where to find a " Bavarian Boy . " I do indeed .
 He 's gathering dust on a shelf in an office up on San Mateo . He 's been there for God knows how long .
 They have no idea what they got .
 To them , it 's not " Bavarian Boy , " it 's " some junk Grandma gave me ... ... I feel too guilty to get rid of . "
 That 's where you come in . This place , they 're not exactly what you call " security- conscious . "
 There 's no cameras whatsoever .
 There 's an alarm on the door that I could probably bridge .
 And past that , you just pick a lock , walk over to the shelf ... ... swap this Wanderer for that Boy , and it 's five minutes , max .
 Warm- up , gentlemen ?
 Yeah , thanks , Fran . JlMMY :
 Oh , thanks . - Heh . That 's cute .
 Isn 't it , though ? FRAN : Yeah .
 Have your food up in a jiff , Mike .
 MlKE : Mmm .
 Look , they 're not even gonna know it 's gone .
 They look at the shelf , they see the same dumb tchotchke ... ... they 've been looking at for years .
 There 's no serial number .
 These things are practically untraceable .
 You send Pryce or some other schlub to Dallas ...
 Next week , they have a collectibles expo .
 Those people are hungry for Hummels .
 Their eyes are gonna pop when they see what we brung them .
 And they will pay through the nose , which we will split fifty- fifty . So it 's perfect , right ?
 We make some nice Hummel- loving lady happy ... ... and we make a bundle .
 Let 's do something beautiful here .
 And how did you come across this valuable wunderkind ?
 - What difference does it make ?
 - The guys in the office cross you ?
 Done you wrong ? Heh .
 What ?
 You 're , uh , missing the point .
 It 's free money . You walk by a 20 on the sidewalk ?
 No , you pick it up .


 - Pass . - What ? Why ?
 It 's not for me .
 Not for you ?
 Is there some problem I 'm not seeing , like , with the swap or something ?
 Plan 's fine , as far as it goes .
 It 's just not for me .
 And I don 't think it should be for you either .
 I 'm sorry about your brother .
 Yeah , thanks .
 You 're really not gonna do this ?
 Sorry .
 FRAN : Eggs , easy .
 MlKE :
 Thanks , Fran . - Can I get you anything else ?
 - No , I 'm good .
 FRAN :
 Sure I can 't get you anything ?
 - No , I 'm not hungry . Thanks .

 All right .
 I , um ...
 If you don 't want easy money , that 's your business .
 I just thought I 'd give you first crack at a golden opportunity .

 And , uh , thanks again for the lift .
 It 's outside your job description , I know . VlOLA :
 It 's no problem . So the acquisitions ?
 Yes .
 We 'll need to draft contracts for the target banks .
 The idea is to have the agreements ready to go while doing due diligence .
 You want me to start cracking on a draft when we 're done ?
 No , but thank you .

 Lubbock , Texas .
 Amarillo , San Antonio , El Paso .
 Then we 'll get up to the Pacific Northwest .
 Boise . Bend , Oregon .
 Eugene , Salem , all the way up to Portland . Now , this one is real special .

 Denver . See here ? We 're gonna add more trees on the west side .
 That 'll be great .
 And then , maybe , uh ... ... a bench or two on the outside .

 No .
 No , no , no .
