The sound of R&amp;B music
ooh
Mary Alice : We all worship heroes for a variety of reasons
Sometimes it 's because of their bravery and sometimes it 's because they take risks
sometimes because of their kindness

Susan I know you 're there we need to talk

this is crazy

I know
What the police tell you is true
I did kill
But there 's one thing they didn 't say
I killed for you Susan
Susan if I can 't have you neither can anyone else
To shut up
knocking
Susan are you at home?
knocking
Susan, your car is still there, I know you 're in there
i wish we could talk
Susan maybe you should wait until I 'm gone
Well I know you don 't want to see me now
but i owe you an explanation
But the answer is there all you want to know about my past
why would i do that
the answer is there
HIP - HOP Music

Hi

what are you doing ?
Well. . .
We 're forming gangs to discuss current events
hey seriously listen if you guys just parked across the street
I 'll let you go
Why don 't you pretend we stopped?

get out of the car




Hey-hey !
Hey stop!
Hey Hey !

It 's hard to believe he 's graduating in two months. He got kicked out of school.
You know it 's lucky that the traffic cop didn 't file a lawsuit
So what should we do?
glad you asked that

what are these ?
These are the brochures for youth correctional institutions
When did you get these things?
It 's been in a drawer for months
I have a feeling we 'll need Bree . . .

I have no idea
Must admit we need help if we can 't discipline A ndrew
We 're going to get someone else to do it for you You really want to take our son
Sent to a detention center?
Oh don 't be so exaggerated
I mean some places here look interesting watching Camp Hennessy
' Camp Hennessy teaches kids how to respect authority and regulations
It 's like a summer camp.' This prison is surrounded by a power grid
must admit
This method is very effective in teaching them how to follow the rules
How about this one? This one is perfect for Andrew
Lots of fresh air and open space on a farm in Montana
Everyday lessons are about anger management
i don 't like this
Okay what about this one?
This is reasonable in the desert
The barracks are a bit shabby but the recidivism rate is extremely low
Bree no
I won 't send my son away
Is it okay to you? He wasn 't openly rude to you
He doesn 't challenge you every day
he doesn 't hate you
Shall I come and talk to him? I 'm going to have a heart-to-heart conversation with him. It 's a bit traditional.
Talk about what you want
I 'm going to check out that place with the power grid
Listen to the children and you will hear the story of the Midnight March
holding up the lantern
on the arch of a northern church steeple
One by land and one by sea
I 'll be on the opposite coast

oh hi i want to meet your mom
I 'm Lynette Scavo
Hi Lynette I 'm Alisa S tevens
oh sorry i thought
It 's alright, I can read lips
Oh
But many times gestures are easier to understand
I don 't want to misunderstand or be misunderstood
I am Lily
oh hi nice to meet you Lily
Hi mom that 's my son Matt
My twins always talk about Matt
We should set a time to play together
great
Let 's have dinner together
Great
Here comes the Englishman! Here comes the Englishman! Catch him!


It 's better for adults to get together
Baby they let go
we caught their pigtails
Who has let go?
D.A. I talked to those lawyers
they asked for a lighter punishment
Is that good news?
That means they compromised
they think they can 't win
ended
oh god dear we can keep this house
no we have to sell the house
I have to pay the attorney 's fees. You just said they asked for a lighter sentence.
Yes but we do not accept
let me down
darling . . . that means i will be in jail for eight months
I think that 's reasonable
Considering that you are indeed guilty
You said you 'd be fine with selling the house
But back then I didn 't know I could keep the house after a few months in prison
the phone is ringing

what ?
no i 'm her daughter-in-law
from the hospital?
Is that mom?

Well. . .
thanks

G abrielle ? sorry Carlos
Some people think that evaluating a person
according to the way they live
Some think it 's based on how they left
I would like to use Lexington rosewood with gold leaf
with pink velvet inside
And it 's hand-embedded
If there is a flood or earthquake
At least know which is her
Don 't you think it 's a bit over the top? My mom uses the best
Baby these burial companies want
Let 's overspend to make big money
What did you say? I said your mother is a very rational person
These fancy things make her uncomfortable
maybe with a wood finish she would like it

what? you never liked mom
It 's hard to like someone who always hates you

She always thinks you 're not worth marrying
And always mention in front of me that she loves you
She treats me like trash
God bless her soul rest in peace I was burying my mother
Now is not the time to save money
Carlos we don 't have that much money now
We 're going to make her funeral match her identity
She was born humble and poor
she is a queen

What did Mike say when he sent you this letter?
This explains everything
Is that right? I didn 't open it
why don 't you watch? i can 't
you are better than me
I can 't wait to tear it apart with my teeth
Don 't you want to know what he wrote?
Think but what if this is just some far-fetched story?
You should first assume why it is ?
Think about how good men are at telling lies
You shouldn 't give them time and pens
Ha ha
car horn
Hi E die would you mind going there again?
I have some ideas for the main guard
Oh Bill wait a minute

This is my new partner and we 're almost dating
Didn 't you say you 'd never mix business with pleasure again?
No I mean never mix pleasure with commitment anymore
That 's right, Susan, what do you do with this letter? Could you please open it sooner?
have you opened

no no i won 't watch
I don 't trust Mike anymore if there is no trust
i 'm going in
tear it up and throw it in the trash
Why wait? Why not tear it now?
i don 't want uh

she is reading that letter
While Carlos was arranging how to bury his mother
Gabrielle is about to find out if she took that secret to the grave Hello I 'm Gabrielle S olis Are you Nurse Heisel? Are you Nurse HEISEL?
yes hello when you call to say you are coming over
I have packed all my personal belongings
The Juanita So olis that your husband brought here is used here
I think that 's why you 're here
You thought too much but you got it wrong
Mistaken ?
My husband and I still don 't know
How did Juanita So olis go?
How did it go?
Did she die peacefully in bed?
yes it 's usually like that
I said I 'm pretty sure it 's usually like that
very sure
I don 't know for sure
because I wasn 't there
Oh
Is anyone with her?
like a nurse anyone

no
she is alone


thank you very much
That 's all I need to know
Oh Mrs Solis!
you throw that away


so terrible

this should be yours
Yes
I 've been looking for this
thanks
You can 't imagine where I found it
These little things attract bare feet the most
and car tires

Since you 're neither lame nor bleeding . . .
It 's only temporary and you need to go and fix the tires
Thank you I will seriously say this is not safe
maybe only 20 to 30 miles
ok i promise i will go
hey listen . . .
I 'm going to have lunch
Would you like to go with me?
lunch ?
yes lunch
are you asking me out?
It 's a bit inappropriate to say that going out to Mexican food and canning soda is a date.
But I think so
Aren 't you dating E die?
We 're going to a place together, not a date
oh how? i pay
I 'm asking Mike 's
Relationships sound a bit complicated
I just can 't figure it out
my current emotional state
I 'm in a mess right now
I don 't know if I can
Develop a new relationship, I mean still sane at this point
I 'm talking about just mexican food for once
Ha ha
sorry ok i get it

You need time to think and heal
yes that 's it
okay then
I 'll check again tomorrow

this is so delicious
I don 't know how you have time for anything else with these four little guys?
This is the kind of hospitality for first-time guests
Usually we eat chicken feet
and macaroni
have you? hey shut up
Tom Do you work in advertising?
Um
I worked for Simon &amp; Scott for five years
I just started working at Simon &amp; Scott
Ha ha
i hate these people
Ha ha
we need to talk
Who are you and . . . you know . . .
They 're going to talk all night
Alisa likes to talk about Alisa
Lynette also likes to talk about Lynette
I don 't believe
You and your husband seem to be in a solid relationship
we have a problem
We are undergoing a marriage diagnosis
Oh yeah? Would you like a steak?
It was her idea and it was unpleasant to be with her again

I look at the clock she always criticizes me
I don 't think you should talk to her about Alisa
so. . .
It doesn 't matter she can 't hear it anyway.
i want some more potatoes
he really said that
When she was still sitting there?
It 's really ugly, he still doesn 't want to shut up
I can 't believe I just played tennis with them
Baby I didn 't know he was a jerk
she is great
Look what she taught me
This means 'I love you'
Great, what should I do?

What 's the meaning ?
Obviously she should know
should not
It 's between Dennis and Alisa
How can I ignore it?
Hear what he says 'she can 't hear anyway'
Lynette you are getting involved
to something that has nothing to do with you
what ?
If it were me, it would be fine
Are you saying I 'm not skilled enough?
You know? If he said that when we were playing
I 'll pull him aside
and say 'that 's not good'
You say I 'm not skilled enough?


ah ah ah


A ndrew throw this garbage out
OK
Go now not five hours later
i go i go god
I 'm meeting Justin at the mall tonight
i need 40 bucks
no
what ?
You don 't have any pocket money anymore

Okay, I 'm not going to take out the trash

A ndrew what do you want? torture me
Come on though I can take it
I think I 've always wanted to be able to make you happy
You 've been unhappy and I don 't know how to help you
You can start by getting out of my way
no now we 're going to talk
I said get out of my way



Next time you touch your mother like this
I 'll throw you out of this wall
have you understood ?



Oh E die wait I have something to ask you
I can 't stop I need to keep my heart rate high
I just wanted to ask you what you would think if I went out with Bill

what ?
Uh Bill ask me out
Bill my Bill ?
Is such that
He doesn 't think he 's your Bill
He said the last time I went out with you was a one-time act
That 's what he said when he asked me out
I told him I thought you were dating him
So you didn 't promise him
No promise, I want to ask you first
wow you are so kind
Can I ?
Can 't E die
E die Why can 't I ?
Because I saw him first
Ha ha
so low class
You asked for my permission and I said no
That 's all
You know technically I don 't need your consent

i want to like you
You just don 't let E die . . .
Su usan you know i tried
I try to forget your past mistakes
your clumsy
your hypocrisy
and your hair
But you always find a way to piss me off
He just wanted to buy me a Mexican
Susan please let me like you
All right
I 'm not going out with him
I mean obviously you have feelings for him
NO, I have not
Really do not have
why ?
If you can 't have him, neither can anyone else?
do you understand ?
Now you think like my friend soul song
soul song
what sound is this!
You have to endure because their mourning is better than anyone else 's
soul song
How much did that horse and cart cost us?
do you care?
become poor? kinda
looking forward to the priest


E die is really hard to accept
Not every man on earth is hers
If I want to go out with Bill I can go
I don 't think you like him at all
she doesn 't like it either
If she doesn 't like why can 't I like it
I 'm going to mourn now



What 's wrong? Why slow down?
because it 's coming


what is that ?
its owner can 't afford the repairs
It 's a great deal
Cellar? You bought your mother a cellar?
Be quiet, everyone is looking at you
Is that right? I can 't participate in this
no
G a b r i e l l e
Don 't be impulsive like a child


Are we going to follow them?
I don 't know maybe it 's part of the ceremony
go to hell carlos


We 're going with the coffin
please come here

unacceptable
The only reason I agree to sell the house
Yeah I thought I 'd have a decent little apartment
Now I don 't even have this

What do you want me to do?
agree to that misdemeanor request
what ?
your sin
Why am I being punished?
Take responsibility like a man!
G abrielle you are ridiculous
I 'm ridiculous?
I just want to be treated the same as your dead mother
G abrielle don 't do it
At least she 's got a roof over her head

1 5 flat




Oh in bounds?
Ha ha ha ha
very good reason
God Alisa you 're just deaf and not blind

It 's the last ball, tell him
i 'm waiting
If you think she 's bad at tennis, try her cooking. Worse
1 5 to 3 0
I am sorry
i should tell you
My tennis is much better than cooking





Hi
it was fun you played well
thanks
she 's playing smart actually



What 's the matter with you? What?
Do you have bottled water there?
I have an electrolyte problem when I sweat
she is your wife
How can you say that to her?
I come to tell you holy Alisa
what to say with a smile on your face
' Move Ass Dennis '
'Cute pants Dennis'
'Clean Your Ears Dennis'
Ok enough if between you and your wife
What 's the problem tell her we 're getting a marital diagnosis
Yes
What 's the use of a marital diagnosis if you dump all your dissatisfaction on a stranger? If you 're dissatisfied with your marriage, do something and don 't just complain
Because frankly I don 't want to hear it
Hey, let 's exchange playmates
OK
thanks
me and you together

Hi
Hi
you should fix
This should . . .
you have to fix
thanks i know i 'm going
it 's my top priority
Oh
It 's hard work

you want a glass of water
Or are you looking for an excuse to come in and chat?
hehe sounds good
How about tomorrow ?
I said I 'd come over to confirm the time
Bill uh . . .
I have my own reasons
Am I annoying?
oh no no
no you not at all
it 's OK
Thank you for thinking so
maybe the word 'dating'
hold me back
I just want to hang out together
just something to eat and drink
no strings attached




ok i go out with you
Great I know it 's nice to have a little place
you 'll love it


what are you doing ?
Make an emergency list for you
What would you do if the roof leaked
or power outage
why ?
sigh
I receive a request for a lighter punishment
you can keep the house

I buried my mother with respect
I don 't spare every penny I spend
I caused it
Our current situation
I didn 't respect you then
that 's unfair
you are so brave
but conditional


i need you to promise me
You were here when I came out
That 's ridiculous
I 'm not going anywhere
i need you to promise me
Be loyal to me when I 'm gone
Of course
Gabrielle I 'm not a fool
you are so beautiful
i know what you need
I am a very jealous and possessive man
I need to hear from you
I promise you
Great
We 're going to see the lawyer tomorrow morning
I love you

I love you too

you know
I will always remember your promise



What happened ?
Is grandma dead?
it 's fine without her
Listen to A ndrew . . .
baby we know
You 've been unhappy with your rebellious behavior
smoking violence . . . that 's not you
We feel you need some time
to think about your life goals
What kind of person do you want to be, what are you talking about?

a local penitentiary
Specifically designed for young people like you
those who lose their way
You must be kidding, they emphasize discipline and responsibility
These two are exactly what you need
Hope you 're only there for a few weeks
stop being funny
I 'm not going to any juvenile correctional facility.
We are ready
I 'm sorry baby you don 't have a choice



Get your hands off !
A ndrew A ndrew
These guys will help you get dressed
Then drive you to camp
we can take over now
wait wait mom wait
- Don 't do this, I 'm wrong Mom, don 't do this- It 'll be alright I promise baby

I know it was your idea you little . . .
R ex stop
baby. . .
no matter what you say or do
i have always loved you
let 's go hurry up


why hug me?
because you are here
Be by my side to accompany me through hard times
You don 't know what it means to me R ex
long time i
I don 't feel like I have a real partner
you really helped me a lot
Especially on a horrible morning like this




the bell rang
Hi Alisa Hi Lily how are you ?
can i talk to you ?
Of course kids
stay here
good mom
How are you ?
Dennis left me
what ?
Dennis left me
why ?
You made him do it, you fool
- I 'm sorry what did you say? - You told my husband about our marriage
it 's none of your business
A lisa wait I don 't understand
speak slowly
sigh



Dennis said you yelled at him
Because he speaks ill of me behind my back
Yes
he said you told him
Marriage counselors don 't work
yes but i mean . . .
How can you tell someone not to go to a marriage counselor?
I didn 't want you guys . . .
yes we have a lot of questions
financial, emotional, sexual
But we 've been solving
Alisa come here

Are you sure you want to . . .
Say these things in front of your daughter?
Now you are teaching me how to educate my daughter? Lily let 's go back
Uh

A l i s a . . .
sorry if i cause trouble
I just want to help
Why? Why do you want to help?
Because oh because I 'm deaf? Not because your husband is a jerk


So you ride a white horse
to save me?
do you know ?
I don 't need to be rescued understand?
I don 't need to be rescued



bitch
uh she said . . . oh thank you i know what she just said


I mean the first second we were making out in the car
Then we were in the hospital
The doctor took a bullet out of him
when i started dating mike
He looks normal, you know?
they always do
Would you like some nachos?
I mean obviously I don 't want to read that letter
In a sense you just want everything to pass, right?
Do you mind without the peppers?
I can 't eat spicy food, I 'm not talking nonsense
just really complicated
A lot about Mike you don 't know

This surprised me

E d i e
your head says
You went out with a very hot girl
Apparently someone has an eye problem
are you following us?
it 's not hard
I 'm just following the smell of betrayal
We have a pact, Susan no no
i want to say
you made me do it
I try to protect our already fragile friendship
Am I related to this?
never again
i will always hate you
you are fired
E d i e
You fired me for having dinner with Susan?
yes before this
Date her and she 's already punishing you enough
keep it



I should have told her it was you who threw in your arms
you 're lonely and begged me to have dinner i pity you that 's why you came
Sounds like my fault
you can 't blame me
I didn 't fire you ok why didn 't you tell me
I 'll go crazy if I go out with you E die
Slow down, you 're driving too fast
It 's between you and E die
I just got sucked in
You must have been telling yourself
What 's the meaning ?
you weren 't involved
That 's not what you 're directing
You spend an hour gossiping about your ex-boyfriend
even if he has a criminal record
Possibly murdered your neighbor
No, he did not
E die tell you not to go out with me
Did you listen? Not because you saw the potential consequences
you don 't stop
ok let 's just hang out
Because I 'm a charismatic easy-going businessman
It 's you chasing my deserving friend


You didn 't repair the tires, did you?
I wanted to fix it
sigh
I guess I did cause it all just a little bit




Tom am I a bad person?



Why not ask that?
I have no idea
I think
Only bad people break other people 's marriages and offend disabled people
I tried to warn you
Yes
Why do I still do it?
This urge makes me
did something wrong
Baby you 're just defending your friend
It 's a big help for her
at least you tried
I adore you for that oh don 't say that
hi you know
I let Dennis speak ill of his wife
'Cause I 'm afraid of self-defeating You know that 's not right
you let him know
it 's me
I 'm never afraid of self-defeating
hey baby i mean you have a strong sense of justice
You are not afraid to act by principle
I adore you for this
Do you know what I adore you?
you try to compliment me
You could have said 'I told you not to do that'


You just wanted to say 'I told you not to do that' didn 't you?
you can never prove

Thank you for coming Mrs Solis
I think you 've seen Nurse Heisel
yes hello

Nurse Heisel loves your mother-in-law
That 's why I let her come here
First of all I want you to understand taking into account our commitment and the trust our patients place in us
cry
OK
Since you said that
It is clearly possible that I emphasized 'may'
We have trouble crying in our caregiving session
I assure you our personnel
Standards are the highest in the industry
But we are human after all
cry
How are you, baby?
Nurse Heisel, why don 't you go out?
I am sorry
uh-huh



We are all sharing your grief
Apparently so
We hope to alleviate later
the pain your family is suffering
we will provide a little
financial compensation
Of course you and your husband still have
the right to sue
financial compensation
Do you want to buy us ?
We don 't want this to go to court
We want this to be seen as an oversight in our care

And so
okay then


Mr. Hartley
I have a hypothetical legal question for you
i want to buy lottery tickets i . . .
haha yes i know it 's weird
I just suddenly like this
If I get hit all of a sudden
I don 't know, maybe $1.6 million
Can the government take it away?
Like taking other things?

I think so too
these bastards
So
lottery lottery if Carlos goes to jail
Will the government still take that money?
assumed
I see
we can keep the house
Hi
Oh I 'm just in the little shop
Do you want to buy lottery tickets?
Thank you Mr Hartley
When will Carlos and I go to D.A. 's office tomorrow?
OK
Mary Alice : We all worship heroes for a variety of reasons
Sometimes it 's because they take risks


sometimes because of their bravery
open mouth
sometimes because of their kindness
I love you

But the vast majority
Because more or less we all dream of being rescued

Of course if the hero we were looking for doesn 't show up
Sometimes we have to save ourselves
