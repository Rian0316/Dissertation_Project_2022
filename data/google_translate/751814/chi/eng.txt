 The main news this Thursday pm is the big government re- shuffle .
 I have with me , to discuss his new empire , the Minister for Administrative Affairs , the Right Honourable James Hacker .
 It 's been said that you are now Mr Town Hall as well as Mr Whitehall . Well , it 's very flattering of you to put it that way .
 It wasn 't me who put it that way , it was the Daily Mirror .
 I just wanted to confirm that you are now this country 's chief bureaucrat .
 That 's nonsense .
 This government believes in reducing bureaucracy .
 Figures I have here say that your department 's staff has risen by 10 % .
 - Certainly not . - What figure do you have ?
 I believe the figure is much more like 9 . 97 .
 Well , it has been suggested that your department is less interested in reducing bureaucracy than in increasing it .
 Well , yes , but that 's because we 've had to take on more staff in order to reduce staff .
 - I beg your pardon ?
 - It 's common sense .
 We need more doctors to cure more patients , more firemen to extinguish more fires .
 How will you extinguish local government bureaucracy ?
 It 's a challenge I 'm looking forward to .
 Would you agree there 's even more bureaucratic waste there than in Whitehall ?
 - Yes , that 's what makes it a challenge .
 - How will you meet the challenge ?
 It 's far too early to give detailed proposals .
 I 've just come here direct from Number 10 .
 From number 9 . 97 , perhaps !
 The broad strategy is to cut ruthlessly at waste while leaving essential services intact .
 That 's what your predecessor said .
 Did he fail ? Let me finish .
 Because we must be absolutely clear and I 'm going to be quite frank with you .
 The fact is that , at the end of the day , it is the right , the duty , of the elected government in the House of Commons to ensure government policy , the policies on which we were elected and for which we have a mandate , the policies for which the people voted , are the policies which , finally , when the national cake has been divided up ...




 And may I remind you we , as a nation , don 't have unlimited wealth ?
 We can 't pay ourselves more than we earn . ... are the policies ...

 I 'm sorry , what was the question again ?
 I was just asking you whether you would agree that your predecessor had failed .
 Certainly not . On the contrary .
 It 's just that this job is an enormous ...
 - Challenge ?
 - Exactly !


 Incidentally , I heard your chap on the radio yesterday , Humpy . - Mm ? - Mm .
 He sounded as if he wanted to DO things about your new local government remit .
 He kept calling it a challenge .
 - Congratulations . - Very kind .
 You may soon be even more important than Arnold !
 - Yes , I expect ...
 Er , no , no , no , no , no .
 - I do want to be quite clear about this .
 I 'd never have given you local government if I 'd thought you 'd let Hacker do anything .
 - He won 't be able to . Nobody else has .
 - That 's not the point , Humpy .
 We 've found in the past that all local government reforms rebound on us .
 When anybody finds a way of saving money or cutting staff in local government , it works for Whitehall just as well .
 Yes , but local government is extravagant , overstaffed , incompetent , whereas we ...

 - Exactly so .
 - I know my duty , Arnold .
 If he needs something to keep him busy , you know what to do ?
 Get him to look into civil defence .

 - Civil defence ?
 You mean fallout shelters ? - Yes .
 Governments long ago decided civil defence was not a serious issue .
 Merely a desperate one !
 It 's best left to those whose incompetence can be relied upon .
 Local authorities !
 But the highest duty of government is to protect its citizens .
 Presumably that 's why they leave it to the borough councils !
 Thank you , gentlemen .
 Can I have a word about a proposal I worked out before we were transferred to this department ?
 - And you are ?
 - I am ... what ?
 - Yes , you are what ?
 - What ? - What ?

 - I am Dr Cartwright .
 If I may put it another way , what are you ?

 I 'm C of E.
 The Minister means , what function do you perform in the department ?
 - Don 't you know ?
 - Yes , I know , but the Minister wants to know . I 'm a professional economist .
 Director of Local Administration Statistics .
 You ran the Local Authority Directorate before we took over .
 Dear me , no . Sir Gordon Reid was the Permanent Secretary .
 I 'm just Under- Secretary rank .
 I fear I shall rise no higher .
 - Why not ? - Alas , I 'm an expert .

 - On what ?
 - On the whole thing . - It 's all in here .
 - What 's this all about ?
 Controlling council expenditure .
 I 'm proposing that all council officials responsible for a new project
 list their criteria for failure before getting the go- ahead .
 - What do you mean ?
 - It 's a basic scientific approach .
 You must establish a method of measuring the success or failure of an experiment .
 When it 's completed , you know if it 's succeeded or failed .
 A proposer states " This scheme would fail if it lasts longer than this
 " or costs more than that , if it employs more staff than these " or fails to meet pre- set standards . "
 - Fantastic ! You could never make it work .
 - 'Course you can .
 It 's all in there .
 This is my top priority reading .
 Why hasn 't it been done before ?
 I can 't understand .
 I put it up several times and it was always welcomed most warmly .
 - But there was always something more urgent on .
 - Well , you 've come to the right place this time .
 Thank you , Minister .

 This is marvellous , isn 't it , Bernard ?
 Isn 't it , Bernard ?
 Oh , yes .
 Well , it 's ... er ...
 That is , it 's ... um ... very well presented .
 - Humphrey will be fascinated .
 - He 's on his way here . - He 'll give his views .
 - What are you saying ?
 Yes , well , as I say , I think that he 'll think that it 's beautifully ... typed .

 - Ah , Minister .
 - Ah , Humphrey , come in . - Sit down .
 - Thank you , Minister .
 Now , local authorities .
 What are we going to do ?
 Minister , this new remit gives you more influence , more Cabinet seniority .
 But do not let it give you any more work or worry . That would be foolishness .
 We 've got to stop this appalling waste and extravagance .
 Why ?
 - Why ?
 - Yes , why ?
 Well , it 's my job .
 We 're the government .
 We were elected to govern .
 Oh , really , Minister .
 Surely you won 't tamper with the democratic rights of freely- elected local representatives ?
 Well ... no , of course not .
 But local government isn 't democratic .
 Local democracy 's a farce ! Most people don 't know who their councillor is .
 They never vote in a local election .
 Those who do regard it as a popularity poll for the government here .
 Local councillors are accountable to nobody .
 They 're public- spirited citizens selflessly sacrificing their spare time .
 - Ever met any ?
 - When there was no alternative .
 They 're either busybodies on an ego trip or in it for what they can get out of it .
 Perhaps they ought to be in the House of Commons .
 Er , I mean , to see how a proper legislative assembly behaves .
 - I 'm going to get a grip on them .
 I have a plan . - You have a plan ?


 Yes .
 I 'm going to insist that any local official who puts up a plan costing more than ... ... say ... Â£10, 000 must accompany it with failure standards .
 - With what ? !
 - With a statement saying he will have failed if his project does not achieve certain ... pre- set results ... ... or exceeds ... fixed time or staff or budget limits .


 Where did you get the idea for this dangerous nonsense ?
 From someone ... in the department .
 I have warned you before about the danger of speaking to people in the department !
 I implore you to stay out of the minefield of local government .
 It is a political graveyard .
 Excuse me , Sir Humphrey , you cannot have a graveyard in a minefield because all the corpses would ... powww !

 - You got me this job , you said .
 - But I didn 't expect you to do anything .
 I mean , you 've never done anything before !
 - Humphrey , I am deaf to your complaints .
 - Please , I beg you ...
 No , no , no , no , Humphrey .
 I want specific proposals straight away .
 And immediate plans for their implementation by local government .
 What 's the fuss about ?
 I 'm only proposing failure standards for local government , not Whitehall .
 - Though come to think of it ...
 - If you insist on interfering in local government , may I make a suggestion that could prove a vote winner ?
 Humphrey , I want to hear no more about ...

 Vote winner ?
 An area of local government that needs urgent attention .
 - What ? - Civil defence .


 You mean fallout shelters ?
 Surely they 're just a joke .
 Precisely , Minister .
 At the moment , they are a joke .
 Local authorities are dragging their feet , but the highest duty of any government is to protect its citizens .
 Some think building shelters makes nuclear war more likely .
 If you have the weapons , you need the shelters .
 - Sometimes wonder why we need the weapons .
 - Minister , you 're not a unilateralist ?
 - Well ... I sometimes wonder .
 - Then you must resign from the government !
 Ah , no , no , no , no , no , no .
 I 'm not THAT unilateralist .
 - America will protect us from the Russians .
 - Who 's talking about the Russians ?
 - Well , the independent deterrent .
 - It 's to protect us against the French ! The French ?

 - But that 's astounding !
 - Why ?
 - Well , they 're our allies , our partners .
 - They are NOW .
 But they 've been our enemies for most of the past 900 years .
 If they 've got the bomb , we must have the bomb !
 If it 's for the French , of course , that 's different .
 Makes a lot of sense . - Yes . Can 't trust the Frogs .
 - You can say that again !
 There is increasing public concern about the bomb .
 If I were to be seen to be doing something about it ...
 I see what you mean .
 Ludovic Kennedy is preparing a BBC documentary on civil defence
 likely to be critical of the current situation .
 If you were seen to be taking decisive measures ...
 Right , yes .
 I always handle Ludo so frightfully well .
 - Right , well , where do we start ?
 - Just a suggestion .
 The London Borough of Thames Marsh spends less on civil defence than any other authority .
 Hm . A ministerial visit , do you think ?
 That 's Ben Stanley 's borough - the one with the wispy moustache , who the press all hate .
 Good point .
 Get onto it straight away .
 Get Bill to make sure the press knows about this visit .
 Tell them I lie awake at night worrying about the defenceless citizens of Thames Marsh .
 Do you , Minister ?
 Well , I will now .
 What makes you think you can come swanning down here from Whitehall and tell us how to run our borough ?
 I 'm not swanning down from Whitehall .
 I 'm asking you why you 've done less than any other borough to protect the people who elected you ?
 - Simple . We can 't find the money .
 - Why don 't you try looking for it ?
 Oh , that 's great !
 Stop school meals , buy no textbooks ?
 - Turn OAPs out into the cold ?
 - I can tell you where to find it .
 - You can ? - Yes .
 Tell him , Dr Cartwright .

 Scrap the plans for the new exhibition centre with the artificial ski slope and jacuzzi pool .
 Close the Feminist Drama Centre , the council 's weekly newspaper and magazine and the Welfare Rights Research Department .
 You can halve the members ' entertainments allowance , sell the Mayor 's second Daimler , postpone the building of the new town hall , and cancel the 20 councillors ' tourism fact- finding mission to Jamaica .


 And close the Gay Bereavement Centre .
 That 'll save Â£21 millions on capital account and Â£750, 000 a year on revenue account .
 Revenue account .
 - That 's just stupid !
 - Why ?
 Well , it 's depriving the disadvantaged of indispensable services !
 - Jacuzzi pools ?
 - I don 't care if we can afford a shelter .
 This is a unilateralist borough .
 We do not believe in nuclear war .
 I don 't believe in it either , but the provision of shelters is government policy .
 It is not Thames Marsh policy .
 Thames Marsh has no quarrel with the USSR .
 It 's not just the USSR we 're frightened of .
 It could be the Fre ...


 - The who ?
 - The ... frigging Chinese !

 If the Russians do invade us , I suppose they 'll say , " Hold on , we 're not at war with Thames Marsh .
 Right , comrades , let 's annex Chelsea instead . "
 Excuse me , Minister .
 I think you may be interested in ...

 Mr Stanley , it appears that you would not be called upon to make the supreme sacrifice .
 - What do you mean ?
 - Is there a shelter under the town hall ?
 Well , is there ?
 - We didn 't build it ! - You maintain it .

 - It 's only a small one .
 - And there is a place in it for you ?
 I was persuaded , with deep reluctance , that my preservation was a necessity in the interests of the ratepayers of Thames Marsh .
 And what provision have you made for other essential persons ?
 Doctors , nurses , firemen .
 People who might be almost as important as councillors .
 One of them 's a chemist !
 Great .
 Nothing like aspirin for the nuclear holocaust .
 Your chap had quite a publicity triumph down at Thames Marsh , didn 't he ?
 - Oh , yes , tremendous .
 - You don 't sound appropriately happy for him .
 - Trouble is he thinks he 's achieved something .
 - Splendid .
 Life is so much easier when ministers think they 've achieved something .
 Stops them fretting . No tantrums .
 Now he wants to introduce his next idea .
 A minister with two ideas .
 I can 't remember when we last had one of those .
 Oh , it 's not his own .
 He wants to introduce failure standards on all council contracts over Â£10, 000 and make a named official responsible .
 - Humphrey ! - I know .
 Cartwright 's idiot scheme !
 I thought Gordon had squashed it .
 He 's come over to us now .
 Slipped the scheme to the minister privately , under plain cover !
 It 'll be us next .
 Once you specify in advance what a project 's supposed to achieve and whose responsibility it is to see that it does , the entire system collapses .
 You 're into the squalid world of professional management .
 I know . I 've tried to explain to him .
 I have pointed out that his new responsibilities were for enjoying , not exercising .
 I don 't know .
 We move our officials round every 2 or 3 years to stop this personal responsibility nonsense .
 If this happened , we 'd be posting everybody once a fortnight .
 He must be stopped .
 What 's his next little publicity trip ?
 Well , tomorrow he 's living his little triumph over again .
 He 's recording a TV interview with Ludovic Kennedy .
 A documentary on civil defence .
 Supposing he had a dossier on the curious ways in which local councillors spend their civil defence budgets .
 - How would that help ?
 - I 've got an idea .
 Perhaps you ought to become a minister !
 Um ... just a joke , Arnold .
 Stand by , studio .
 We 're about to record .
 A change for a minister to be given a chance to talk about something that 's a success .
 Is this a change of policy ? ... 2 ... 1 . Most unusual for the BBC .


 You 've been claiming recently that in your dealings with local authority , you 've been making progress as regards civil defence .

 Surely this has been more in the field of publicity than any achievement ?
 No , no , no , no , Ludo .
 Authorities are being made to face up to these issues because of the interest we have generated .
 You 're agreeing .
 Your success has been a publicity success .
 Well , yes , but things are changing .
 - Well , what about Thames Marsh ?
 - Ah , Thames Marsh . Good example .
 As I said in the press , they have one shelter .
 A place in it is reserved for Ben Stanley , council leader , who refuses to build shelters for others .
 Don 't you think that 's hypocritical ?
 Surely it 's reasonable to expect that one of our elected representatives should survive .
 - Who is to govern otherwise ?
 - In the event of a nuclear holocaust - and , of course , we all pray that such a thing will never happen - there are perhaps more important people than mere politicians .
 Doctors , nurses , ambulance men , and so on .
 All people who run essential services .
 Correct me if I 'm wrong , but is it not a fact that the PM and Home Secretary have places reserved for them in government fallout shelters ?
 That is completely different .
 How ?
 Well , there has to be someone to ... run the ... you know .
 Minister , you 're saying political leaders should give up their places for doctors and nurses .
 Have you put this idea to the PM and the Home Secretary ?
 I think we ought to be careful not to trivialise what is a very serious issue , Ludovic .
 I 'll give you another example .
 I know of a borough which sent councillors , at the ratepayers ' expensive , to California to look at shelters .
 But they couldn 't do anything about it because they 'd spent the entire civil defence budget for three whole years on the trip !
 - How shocking .
 - Shocking .

 Thank you , Minister .
 By the way , how did the recording go ?
 Well , I got into a bit of bother over Ben Stanley 's bunker .
 I said politicians weren 't as important as doctors and so on .
 Did you ?
 Then he said " What about the PM 's place in the government shelter ? "

 - And what did you say ? - I got out of it .
 Quite cleverly , actually .
 I 'm not too sure how happy the PM will be about it .
 Then I recovered with a marvellous story about some councillors who went to California to look at shelters and spent three entire years of the civil defence budget on the jaunt !

 - May I ask where that came from ?
 - Yes .
 Where did that come from ?
 From the Civil Defence Directorate .
 They knew you were doing the interview .
 Oh , well .
 Anyway , Minister , I 'm sure you know what you 're doing .
 Humphrey ... you only say that when I 've made an appalling cock- up .
 You do know the borough in question contains the PM 's constituency ... ... and that the PM 's election agent was the councillor who led the delegation ?


 - That was just a joke , wasn 't it ?
 - Number 10 have been trying to keep it quiet .
 - Oh , well , truth will out .
 - No , no , no ! No , no , no , it mustn 't out .
 It might look like a personal attack .
 You know what the PM 's like about loyalty .
 This interview must not go out .
 Well , unfortunately , I haven 't the time , I must be going .
 Humphrey , I ... I ... I ...
 I 'm ordering you , Humphrey .
 - Alas , your orders are calling me away .
 - What do you mean ?
 Your scheme for imposing failure standards on local councils is very complex .
 You asked for proposals straight away .
 It 's taking every moment of my time .
 Much as I would like to help .
 However ... if implementing failure standards were not quite so urgent ...
 You mean , you can stop this broadcast ?
 Now , Minister , we cannot censor the BBC , but I happen to be lunching with the BBC 's Director of Policy .
 - Perhaps you 'd care to join us .
 - But if we can 't censor them ...
 We could persuade them to withdraw programmes voluntarily once they realise that transmission is not in the public interest .
 Well , it 's not in MY interest ... and I represent the public , so it 's not in the public interest .

 That 's a novel argument .
 We haven 't tried that on them before .
 Have we ?

 The BBC cannot give in to government pressure . - Let 's leave that on one side ...
 - No , no ! Let 's leave that on one side , shall we ?

 Please , Minister .
 Frank , could I raise something else ?

 There is considerable disquiet about the BBC 's attitude and hostility towards the government .
 - But that 's absurd .
 - Is it ?
 They 've been documenting instances of bias in BBC current affairs .
 Favourable news stories not reported .
 Oh , yes .
 Excessive publicity for other countries ' cases against Britain .
 Especially our Common Market enemies ... ... um ... partners .
 Oh , yes .
 Jokes against the Prime Minister .
 Unnecessary publicity for anti- government demonstrations .
 And ministers ' programme suggestions not accepted .
 - I had no room in my case for the others .
 - I 'm sure we have answers to all these .
 The BBC 's always got answers .
 Silly ones . Yes , of course .
 I thought it fair to warn you that questions are being asked .
 - What sort of questions ?
 - Well , for example , were Parliament to be televised , whether it shouldn 't be entrusted to ITV .
 - You can 't be serious ?
 - And whether the BBC administration is making the cuts in jobs and premises that we 've endured in government .
 Should a select committee scrutinise BBC expenditure ?
 - That would be an intolerable intrusion .
 - Well , of course .
 Then there 's this extraordinary matter of boxes at Ascot , Wimbledon , Lords , Covent Garden .
 Ah , yes , those are a technical requirement for the production and engineering staff .
 Reports from the Inland Revenue suggest that the production and engineering staff are all holding champagne glasses .
 And are all accompanied by their wives or ... ... ladies of ... equal distinction .

 And all bear a remarkable similarity to governors , directors and executives of the Corporation , and their friends .
 Oh , I say , you 've come out very well .

 It is possible we can contain all this criticism , provided the files don 't get any larger .
 I 've urged my minister that there 's no need to take up the civil defence issue formally .
 But ... But you must see my position .


 - The BBC can 't give in to government pressure . - We wouldn 't want them to . - Wouldn 't we ?
 - No , of course not .
 The minister 's interview with Ludovic Kennedy did contain factual errors .
 Factual errors ? That 's different .
 The BBC couldn 't give in to government pressure .
 - Absolutely not .
 - But we set great store by factual accuracy .
 Some of the information might well be out of date by the time ...
 Out of date ? Ah , now , that 's serious .
 Obviously , the BBC couldn 't give in to government pressure .
 - Oh , indeed not .
 - But we can 't transmit out- of- date material .
 And since the recording , I realised that I made one or two slips that might have security implications .
 - Such as ? - He can 't tell you what they are .


 - Why not ?
 - Security . Can 't be too careful about security .

 If the defence of the realm is at stake , we must be responsible .
 Obviously , the BBC couldn 't give in to government pressure , but security - you can 't be too careful .
 - Can 't be too careful . - Can 't be too careful .
 If there are inaccuracies and security worries , the BBC wouldn 't want to put the interview out .
 - Precisely .
 - That puts a different complexion on it .
 Transmission would not be in the public 's interest , but I must make one thing absolutely clear .
 There can be absolutely no question of the BBC ever giving in to government pressure .
 Oh , good news , Minister .
 The BBC have decided not to send out your interview with Ludovic Kennedy .
 - Really ? - They felt that was the responsible course .
 - Well done . - Oh , it was nothing .
 Yet , you know , I can 't help feeling that I was trapped into saying those things that might 've embarrassed the PM .

 - Surely not ?
 - Yes .
 - I think I was dropped right in it .
 - How could you think such a ridiculous thought ?
 Why is it ridiculous to imagine that he would 've tried to trap me ?
 Who ?
 Ludovic Kennedy .
 Oh , Ludovic Kennedy tried to trap you .
 Yes , well , I 'm sure he did .
 - Deceitful crowd , the media .
 Underhand . - No , thoroughly deceitful .
 By the way , I think it might be wise to lay off the local councils .
 Oh , yes ?
 After all , councillors are responsible , sensible people on the whole .
 - And they are democratically elected . - Democratically elected .
 Central government must be frightfully careful before it tells them how to do their jobs .
 Frightfully careful .
 And the failure standards ?
 Well , I think the same applies ... don 't you ?
 Yes , Minister .
