Coming to our studio to discuss his new empire are I havewithme , todiscusshisnewempire , the Honourable James Hacker , the Minister for Administrative Affairs , the Minister for A dministrative A ffairs , James Hacker .
It is said that you are now Town Hall and Whitehall Reds
You are too much. Well, it  ' sveryflatteringofyout oputitthatway .
I 'm not talking about Mr. Huck, I 'm talking about I twasn 'tmewhoputitthatway, I twasthe Dally Mirror, as the Daily Mirror said. I just want to confirm that you are now the biggest bureaucrat in our country.

Nonsense This administration has made it its mission to shrink the bureaucracy T hat  ' snonsense .
T h i s   g o v e r n m e n t   b e l i e v e s   i n   r e d u c i n g   b u r e a u c r a c y .   我 手 头 的 数 据   F i g u r e s   I   h a v e   h e r e   s a y
Say your department employees are up 10% thatyourdepartment ' sstaffhasrisenby 10%.
What about your data? Certainly not. What figuredoyouhave?
I believe it 's 9.97% at most
Increase instead of decrease bureaucracy inreducing bureaucracy thanincreasingit .
In order to finally lay off the inordertoreduestaff .
How do you say this? The truth is simple I begyourpardon ? it  ' scommonsense .
If you want to treat more patients, you need to ask more doctors W eneedmoredoctorstocur emorepatents ,
To put out more fire requires more firemen morefirementoextingui shmorefires . So how do you eliminate local bureaucracy ?
H o w   w i l l   y o u   e x t i n g u i s h   l o c a l   g o v e r n m e n t   b u r e a u c r a c y ?
It 's hard so go up to it I t  ' sachallenge I  ' mlookingforwardto . You don 't agree with the bureaucracy there W ouldyouagreethere  ' sevenmorebureaucratic waste
Worse than Whitehall? therethanin W hitehall?
Yes , that  ' swhatmakesitachalleng e .
So how are you going to face adversity? How willyoumeethechall enge ?
It is too early to talk about detailed plans at the moment I t  ' sfartooearlytogivedet ailedproposals
I just came from 10 Downing Street I  ' vejustcome here directf rom Number 10 . Could it be 9 . 9 7 ?
F romnumber 9 . 9 7 , perhaps !
without affecting the core functions whileleavingessential servicesintact . your ex said the same thing you mean he failed ?
T h a t ' s   w h a t   y o u r   p r e d e c e s s o r   s a i d .
D idhefall ? Please listen to me because this point must be shown Letmefinish .
I also want to make it clear to you and I  ' mgongtobequitefrankwi thyou . In fact all in all our rights and our obligations Thefactisthat , attheendoftheday , I tistheright , theduty , our elected government oftheelectedgovernmen tintheHouseofC ommons
is to defend government policy policy elected us toensuregovernmentpol icyonwhichwewereelected
We have a heavy responsibility and for which we haveaman date ,
also the policies for which the people voted, the policies for which the people voted,
Policies are the same in the end arethepolicieswhich, finally,
Divide the national cake . . . whenthenationalcakeha sbeendividedup . .
Our salary cannot exceed income We can  ' tpayourselvesmorethan wearn .
And the policies . . . . . arethepolicies . . .
Excuse me to ask again?
I  ' msorry , whatwasthequestionaga in ? Mr. Huck I ask if you agree I wasjustaskingyouwheth eryouwouldagree
your ex failed thatyourpredecessorha dfailed.
Of course not quite the opposite Certainly not . Onthecontrary . Precisely because this work requires great effort . . .
I t ' s   j u s t   t h a t   t h i s   j o b   I s   a n   e n o r m o u s . . .

Up against the odds? It 's the C hallenge?
