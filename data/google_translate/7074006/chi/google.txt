I 've heard of a case that feels like a good fit for you
Interested? Of course
It 's not convenient for me to give you all the details right now
But I can give you the general framework
There 's a young woman in her early 20s
I 'm pregnant with my first baby.
very healthy she developed complications
Then go to the hospital to prepare for delivery
But something went wrong with the anesthesia and she vomited into her own oxygen mask
breathing stops
baby born safely
But the young mum suffered severe brain damage
She fell into a coma with a mask on
The family was naturally hit hard
They are bankrupt so they have no way to pay for this young lady 's medical bills
The hospital refused to take responsibility and they hired
The most expensive law firm in China This is the plot of 'The Great Trial'
is not that right
because only in movies
Such a once-in-a-lifetime classic case
Do you know what case I 'm going to try next?
A cleaner urinated on his boss and the next
A woman stabbed her boyfriend for a grilled cheese sandwich
The real world is like that Ms. Wexler
There won 't be a big case to save bankruptcy lawyers
Don 't feel like you 're the first to fish in my court
People who want to rediscover their love for the law are not
You 're still doing the Mesa Verde business honestly
Make a lot of money
donate to charity
Speaking of which, our public defenders have been overworked
so watch out
Next time I see you in my courtroom, I 'm going to let you do it.

I think he needs friends
Every time I see him he gets worse
Henry is fine - you talked to him - no need

That guy tells a different story every time, doesn 't he?

Surrender, fool
Surrender if you want to come out alive
You 're out of bullets, surrender.






We wiped out Espinosa and they were all dead
What about the Salamanga brothers?
Marco got shot, but he 'll make it through
They went back south and waited for things to settle down
It 's because of the territory, right?
Salamanga family who killed Espinosa
Espinosa 's territory is vacant
The cartel can 't give it to the Salamanga family
So I think they 'll give you the territory

Stacey today I got up and took a shower Kelly got up on her own
Then get yourself ready for school just an ordinary morning
I made French toast for breakfast and we talked about what she made for the science fair
Toothbrush with automatic toothpaste I took her to school and then to work
Then I realized something
I don 't know why I realized then but
I didn 't think about Marty all morning
not once

when i was french toast
Why didn 't I remember it was his favorite
I think of Marty every time I make breakfast
but not today
more than a few minutes
I haven 't thought of him for hours
If I could not think about him for a few hours then
So why can 't it be all day?
Why can 't it be a whole week I mean if I forget his voice
What if I completely forget him I know I can 't it 's impossible but
i don 't know i just i don 't know
thank you Stacey you 're not alone really
The process can be painful
But if you ask me I think it 's improved a lot of people in this room
I 've had the same feeling you said I know I had I 've been trying to get that feeling
to live in this moment
I know it 's going to be what Judy wants but it 's hard
a working colleague
