Greek interpreter
I have known Sherlock Holmes for a long time During mylongandintimat eacquaintance
Intimate with S herlock H olmes , but never heard him speak of his family I  ' dneverheardhim refer to his relations , and seldom heard him speak of his early life andhardlyevertohisown earlylife .
He 's so taciturn I sometimes Becauseofthisreticence,I sometimesfoundmyselfI think he 's a lonely eccentricregardinghimasanisola tedphenomenon lacks sympathy asdeficientinhumansym pathy
But also with extraordinary wisdom ashewaspre - eminentinintelligence . I started to think he was an orphan I  ' dcometobelievethathew asanorphan
No relatives are alive withnorelativesliving . But one day I am amazed by Butoneday , tomyverygreatsurprise ,
He actually talked to me about his family hebegantotalktomeabou thisfamily .
She is the sister of the French artist Barnet whowasasisterof B ernais , the F rechartist . This artistic ingredient in the blood T heartintheblood
Easily the most peculiar form of inheritance isliabletotakethestra ngestforms.
For example my brother Mycroft Forexample , mybrother , Mycroft .
Your brother Yourbrother ?
I never knew you had a brother I didn  ' tknowyouhadabrother ?
Oh yes Oh, yes. And I can assure you that A nd I canassureyou, he has more amazing hepossessesafargreate rfaculty than me
Observation and reasoning abilities of observation and deduction than I do .
Holmes, I know that you are a modest man
Haha Ha - ha . My dear Watson M ydear Watson ,
I can 't agree with you I cannotagreewiththose humility as a virtue thatrankmodestyamongt hevirtues.
To the logician Tothelegation, everything should be as it should be, everything should besee nexactlyasitis.
A man who underestimates himself A ndtounderestimateone  ' sself is as much as exaggerating his own talents isasmuchadeparturefromthetruth will only lead him to deviate from the truth astoexaggerateone  'sownability .
All I Said About My Brother What I havejusttoldyouaboutm ybrother
All are accurate and true istheexactandliteralt ruth. Well of course I believe what you say Well, naturally, I don 'tdoubtyourword. But if England really has another Butifthereisanotherman in England
A man with such singular power s ,
then why the police public howisitthatneitherthe policenorthepublic
I haven 't even heard of him? haveeverheardofhim , letalonemyself ?
He is well known in his own circles He  ' sverywell knowninhisow ncircles .
What circle? W herethen ? The Diogenes Club The Diagones C lub .
That is the strangest club in London I tistheoddestclubin London ,
And my brother is one of the weirdest people out there and mybrotheroneoftheo ddestmen .

You must really want to meet him I supposeyouwishtomeeth im ?
That is of course Well, ofcourse I do,
Although I just want to confirm the existence of such a person evenifit  ' sjusttoprovethatheexi sts .
Then in the afternoon you can get the answer Thenyoushall , thisafternoon .
He came across a very peculiar case, Hehascomeacrossthemost singularproblem,
And thought I would be interested whichhethinksmightint erestme . But why didn 't Mycroft Butwhydoes M ycroftnotuse solve the case by his own superior reasoning abilities? hisgreatpowersfordete ctivework ?
If the art of detectives was only if I ftheartofthedetective began to reason in an armchair and ended inreasoningfr omanarmchair ,
My brother is going to be the greatest detective that everlived mybrotherwouldbethegr eatestcriminalagent in history.
The detective business I depend on for a living Whatistomeameansoflive lihood
For him it was mere interest istohimthemeresthobby ofadilettante.
He has neither the ambition nor the energy B uthehasnoambitionandn oenergy .
What is his profession? Whatishisprofession , then ?
He has an amazing talent for numbers. Hehasanextraordinaryfa cultyforfigures . He helps the government department Heauditsthebooks

So what kind of people are the members of this club, Butwhatarethequalifica tions? for the Diogenes C lub?
My brother is one of the founders of mybrotherisoneofthefo undingmembers .
It accommodates the most isolated I tcontainsthemostunsoc iable in town
and the least sociable they never talk andclubfulmenintimewh ospeaknotaword
Even casual glances from others will dodge andshuneventhemerestg lance.
All right, let 's go in Now, letusenter.
