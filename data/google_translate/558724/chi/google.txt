He won 't let us be friends
Who says he has to know how I spend my spare time?
Gabrielle made a discovery . . .
I 'm pregnant and it 's all your fault!

You hired your ex girlfriend and you didn 't tell me for three months?
Susan decides on a date . . .
Can you help me solve the problem?
I think I could be when Sophie Bremmer was young
She is incurable for romance
And she 's naive and hopeless, that 's why she got married four times
The first time that man likes to gamble
The second time the man likes to drink
The third time that man likes another man
The fourth time that man was the object of her second marriage
Yes, Sophia is tired of heartbreak
She decided she would never marry again
However this night . . .
Sophie ! Someone came to visit her
S o p h i e !
Morty ? What are you doing ?
I want to talk to Sophie
Now ?
you 're drunk ?
A little bit
How are you, Susie ?
I 'm going to talk to her . . . to Sophie
Are you crazy? It 's one o 'clock in the morning
she fell asleep
i asked her to marry me
what ?
i thought i would be happy
The restaurant starts to make a profit
I bought a new car and my cholesterol started to drop but without her
nothing is happy
Morty , I don 't think it 's possible
she has a new life
Why don 't you sit down? I 'll call a taxi for you
S o p h i e
Your doctor told you not to drink alcohol
Sometimes you need wine to give you courage


Is this ring from Dolores?
You gave her the ring of your deceased wife ?
It 's a 3 carat diamond I don 't think she would mind someone
wore this ring
Soph, will you agree?
Ok really?
really? yes
but i want you to be more formal
You know. . .
here
Sophie, can you give me the honor of being my wife?
Sophie Bremmer still romantic hopeless . . .
But it 's a little different tomorrow we 'll replace this with the ring I want I want a diamond bigger than the Dolores
She is no longer naive

Marriage is a Simple Concept
It 's a contract between two people that keeps them together for the rest of their lives. Hope they can live happily ever after
Sadly, some contracts . . . are destined to be broken
I haven 't touched your birth control pill
yes? yes

look
Someone ripped it apart and glued it on
This may be fake from the manufacturer
You can also see the glue primer
I tell you, I haven 't moved
Carlos , don 't take me for a fool
You 've been wanting a baby for months
Who else will ?
I do not
Wait a moment
What 's up ?
mother
Confidence
possible
You buy it every six months, right?
so ?
I told her before the accident that I wanted a baby
She said she 'd do it
I thought she would tell you
baby, i 'm so sorry
that bitch
Can not believe it
I love her
But sometimes I also think she goes too far
I mean she 's very controlling sometimes
Crawling out of the grave and messing up my life
Gosh, she 's so nice. Where are you going?
I 'm going to feel sick right away
When I feel like throwing up, I want to stand by your mother 's grave
Honey, I 'll be back later tonight
Peteson wants us to go for a drink
fine
I have something to tell you?
Did you know? Your car squad has arrived
let 's go, it 's alright
Lynette, what 's the matter? It 's alright
OK
only- -

We haven 't had sex for ten days. We used to be nine days the longest, are you sure?
don 't we have it wednesday night?
We were just about to do you fall asleep
So why are you so worried?
If you want, we 'll do it tonight
Casual
No, we 've been abstinent for ten days
we do tonight
Don 't worry about anything, okay?
Damn? I forgot my briefcase
Can you tell them I 'm coming?
Of course Lynette


Tom is almost ready?
he just went to get the briefcase
I 'm sorry it 's okay

good morning dear, bye bye
goodbye i know
I know
thank you for keeping me
I will miss you both so much
Without you, the house would be empty
Can 't you two stay a little longer?
Do not
They want to start their new life quickly
We don 't want to keep these two crazy boys goodbye, Morty
goodbye
listen, i hope
I hope it 's all right, but your mom told me something about you
your affair with the plumber across the street
she said ?
Yes
don 't give up on him
I mean if I gave up I wouldn 't be with such a lovely lady now
Did she tell you that he was in prison for manslaughter?
she skipped that part
I don 't think she told you he was a drug dealer
I can 't remember
i went there
I told him how much you love him
What are you thinking about?
What did he say?
What did he say?
I think I went at a bad time
someone just died
real ?
he needs a shoulder to cry
Can I give you another hug?
I can not hold it in
George , you gotta try this
A little messy, but . . .
I can not wait anymore
Fennel seeds? It tastes so good
I am not sure
Is it a crime to eat something so delicious isn 't it interesting, taste the food on the plate

Open the mind to new senses ?
R ex hates chef 's cooking
He likes to stay at home with a plate of noodles and a beer
How about marinara sauce?
This is the best sauce I 've ever tasted
I 've had better, but in Italy you 've been to Italy ?


before the child is born
We had a very happy few years there
I think it 's because it 's easier to be happy then
I don 't know why you say that
i can 't drink anymore
Maybe we should go to Italy?
Isn 't it interesting?
Go to those museums and churches
have some carefree days
George , I can 't travel with you
I 'm married, people gossip
sorry it 's a bad idea, you 're right
don 't think about it
I want you to try these clams
I bet they are as good as marinara sauce
OK
you are so right
Such delicious food is a crime
She might actually go to your house with F lonse
ok kids
It 's 7 o 'clock, it 's time to go to bed
let 's go
Why do we have to go to bed so early?
Honey, I told you that Dad and I have a special meeting tonight
hurry up
I love you all


Today is the tenth day
Honey, wait a minute and let me see what the company has to offer

What are you thinking
I 'm wondering what that smells like
Oh
It must be the baby 's saliva.
There
make it more convenient for you
I 'm coming

What 's up ?
So the flavor is really strong?
is a little thick
It 's a natural pattern for babies to spit up
Do you want me to change into a H azmat suit or do you want to ?
I just love that you 're clean and wearing some sexy clothes
I don 't have any clean sexy clothes
Not crayon marks on every garment
Okay, okay, I said I 'm sorry
You make me feel like I just got off the fishing boat for God 's sake
darling, i said i 'm sorry
just, you know
We just want women, you know, put a little effort into something
All right
Can we start kissing again?
Can you try again?
OK
ok go away
mother !
mother
Susan Mayer hired you
I know
She decided to take a closer look at your life so you 're lucky to call me and ask for help
She found me in the phone book, what should I do?
go
Get the kids out of here
It 's ridiculous, my son doesn 't want to move
He 's hard to shake
I can leave her in the air for a while
very good
OK, then
Tell me what exactly you want this woman to believe is true
She was born Angela when she was a teenager
she changed her name to Mary Alice
The application said she was named after a relative she had never spoken to
Here is her birth certificate and her legal name change application
What happened to Dana?
Here 's another kid 's record
A girlD ana Marie Young
Died at 18 months, apparently from a fall from a height
it 's all true . . .
what he said is true
How could I be so wrong?
I have to do some comparisons
Of course
before you go
I want you to check the other guy 's background
Here 's a plumber I know
Did you get my message?
I didn 't call you back because I wanted to talk to you alone
You can tell me anything, Mrs Solis
I can handle it
I 'm pregnant, the baby could be yours
I can 't even get enough money to buy a bike
How can I raise a child?
We don 't know if the baby is yours yet, relax
I didn 't come to see you go crazy
Then why are you here?
I 'm sure you 'll let me protect you who 's going to embarrass me?
Carlos and your parents ?
John , something like this will ruin you
So be careful to keep secrets
There 's no reason for this to ruin us both
Thank you
Forget it I should be wearing a condom
yes that would help
You hired a private detective? I don 't believe Mike
I want to know what happened
came suddenly
Open it
Okay
Are you ready? Get started
stop
what ?
All right
If you find something really bad try to give me a good sign first
OK
I have good news . . . and bad news
give me the bad news first
The guy Mike killed . . . was a cop oh my god
Oh my God
All right
tell me the good news
no
what ?
You asked me to give you a good omen first, I tried my best
forget it
I 'll see it myself
Can 't believe what?
I know her
what happened ?
You two have to keep going, don 't you?
D eirder died
It doesn 't matter who killed it, let it go
It 's not that easy, Kendra what?
My sister hates you - - hates you both
she said
That 's because she said it when she was on drugs
All right
those drugs
De eirdre shamed the whole family She rejected all our love head on
She knows we love her, she just doesn 't care
Did you love her?
I want to know what are you guys planning
we 're just talking casually
I do not believe you
then don 't ask anything
I don 't want a new cardiologist Lee has been experimenting for weeks
Well, by now, he should already know where your problem is.
Dear, we live in a community with them
What do you want me to tell Helen?
All I know is that I 'm feeling worse and worse I have something to do

I 'm going to talk to E die about Bree, we 're going to be late

For a while, I just need to... .
a square
E d i e
I saw you in the restaurant yesterday
i saw you too
dirty, dirty
Can you say that again ?
that guy
the one you spoon fed
Not too bad, but a little too short for me
But again, it wasn 't me who slept with him.
That 's what I 'm worried about
me and george are just friends
I didn 't say anything about you, I know
R ex clinging wife is a whore
It 's time to pay the price, you 're totally wrong
that man is a pharmacist
You can have an affair with anyone you choose a pharmacist ?
you 're a republican
I didn 't cheat with anyone
George and I just talk
He was very good at listening to me telling him about my hopes and dreams and what was in my heart -
nothing more
You have to believe me
I believe you
thanks
I 'm glad you figured it all out
I know it looks weird, but I don 't want you to think I 'm cheating on my husband
but you are
what ?
Bree , okay
You put your heart 's dream
Your hopes, your thoughts tell this man ?
Except for sex, it sounds like you 're pretty close and this man isn 't your husband
I mean everyone needs someone else to listen
Why can 't you tell Reex?
We are not at home, please leave a message hello? ZACH?
It 's me FELICATILMAN.
I really enjoyed your visit and haven 't seen you in a while
I hope you are all right
ZACH is a little uncomfortable
Oh, PAUL.
And I don 't think it 's good. He stays at your house all the time.
i made some hot cocoa
how do you feel?
I 've been sick for two days
Do you think I should see a doctor?
maybe just a cold
We will keep an eye on your symptoms
It 's the house, ZACH. I feel it.
We live here, it 's bad for our health
I told you
i don 't move
It 's for your own good, you can 't run around like this
do what you do now
For example, go to SUSANMAYER 's kitchen
people will understand
Haven 't you been new here?
Somewhere in the country?
you will meet new friends
maybe meet another girl
Can you sleep now?
We 'll talk about moving tomorrow
Mary Alice : Lack of passion in marriage becomes a very unpleasant reality for LYNETTE
Then one day, she stumbled upon the best way to fight reality . . . just a little fantasy.
Of course, all the fantasies in the world won 't do you any good if no one shows up to appreciate it
I 'm so sorry to send you like this, TOM .
you didn 't send me
You 've been flying all day, why stay in a hotel?
I just hope you don 't mind me sleeping on the sofa
Sofa should be fine
Hey, HONEY .
Why don 't you let the maid do it?
Hahaha. Not funny at all, TOM.
Oh yes, GARY is taking a shower
He asked if you could, bring him a clean bath towel and your short horse whip haha
C O M E   O N .
I 'm glad you find my shame so funny
HONEY , you 're wearing this French maid outfit
I mean, please, what are you thinking?
I 'm thinking our marriage is in trouble for one of us and something needs to be done to save it
Whoa, when did our marriage get into trouble?
OK, is it a big problem that we haven 't had sex in a while? Sometimes it 's like that

Oh ─ ─ it 's ANNABEL . How ironic
How does ANNABEL relate to our conversation?
 'Cause she 's coming every morning now to remind you that I 'm not
nothing
Her fantasy, TOM - -
The beauties you work with every day have manicured nails, designer clothes
I . . . is reality. lol
Undressed wife 's clothes smell uninteresting
OK, that 's probably the dumbest thing you 've ever said
I used to be that fantasy
Once upon a time I didn 't need a maid outfit because I knew I could handle you
Even in a smelly T-shirt
Obviously . . . it 's not like that anymore
I don 't know what to say if I have a way to fix it
I will for sure. You just tell me what to do, I 'll do it
Nothing to fix, haha
We 've all changed, that 's what I mean

are you ready?
You should go. You don 't want ANNABEL waiting

Be careful, you 'll make the baby 's heart hurt
I don 't think it 's spicy enough
My hormones are killing my taste buds
you gotta watch your food soon you have to
I 'm going to be a fat woman, just as a tribute to your mother
JOHN , what are you doing?
I thought about it for a long time, about that baby
real? Why? ?
Because it 's probably mine
If so, I 'm going to do something right
do not. do not. do not
No one expects you to do the right thing!
Yeah, I kind of feel like you 're trying to trick me
So I went straight to Mr. SOLIS
What? Are you crazy? He 's going to kill us both
He and I are going to settle this man 's business quietly
This is the best way for the baby
J O H N .
Do you want him or me? OKAY.
you win
wait here

don 't come out
Why?
Because I 'm coming in, haha ​​really?
Look, pregnant women 's desires are strong
ok ok, i 'll go get my makeup done
be right back
OK .
You sit, haha ​​sit. Haha
i play some music

CARLOS is currently unavailable.
you are lying
JOHN , what are you doing
- Mr. SOLIS?! - Shhh! stop
Mr. SOLIS, open the door! what are you doing? JOHN!

J O H N !
please get out of the way
what are you doing
- Get out of the way! - Stop, JOHN - - No!
Mr. SOLIS - - Ah! Omg!
Oh my god, it 's so hot!
sorry, it 's just chili juice
It feels like sulfuric acid!
Really? I 've always found it tasteless
- Mr. SOLIS?!
-   J O H N !
Mr. SOLIS, come out! I want to talk to you!
JOHN , shut up. JOHN , shut your mouth
listen to me
You can never be a baby 's dad
No matter what the paternity test says, it 's CARLOS 's child
How can you say that?
Because CARLOS has it all, JOHN .
He will give the baby everything
piano lessons, summer camps, and . . . . . . - - the best colleges
He can raise the baby the way the baby should be raised and you can 't
It has nothing to do with money, OKAY ?
It 's about what 's best for your baby
If you want the best for your baby, you have to help me
OKAY ? Help me make sure my baby doesn 't grow up as poor as me
Why are you so slow, hello, JOHN .
How did you come?
Well, he--
JUSTIN is thinking about rearranging the hydrangea
He wants me to come and see and ask my opinion
your friend - - is a good boy
But he 's not half as good as you as a gardener
you should come back to work for us
I mean, you 're almost like family.
Thank you, Mr. SOLIS
ZACH , are you there?

I have to do this. I know you will forgive me

Hey
Hey
The sons are asleep
sleepy
OK. Where 's PENNY?
Sounds like sleep
Okay
Okay, wait till this stops and come to my bedroom TOM, you-- what is this?
wait until it stops
ok, i 'm in

Omg! Ha ha ha ha
You want to fantasize? I 'll give you some fantasies
Oh come here, woman.
P R E P A R E   T O   B E   B O A R D E D .
Also, please hurry up
This thing is so tense
Ha ha
I still like it
ok. turn the lights off. lol no
Confidence
do not turn off the lights
- Please. - do not want
- Please. - No, no, no. Oh! Meow!
door open
Oh, Paul, it 's you
i 'm so happy
I have something for you to see
where is my son
He 's still sleeping upstairs because of those tranquilizers you gave him
I don 't know what you think you 're doing but I 'm taking my son with me
I 'm not like my sister, Paul
Don 't mess with me.
MARTHA has a diary
Documenting every monotonous thing in her monotonous life
Categorize carefully
Including her finding out that you and your wife stole a baby
A baby named DANA
I 'm sorry these copies are hard to read
I hid the original in a safe place
It seems like a reasonable precaution because MARTHA was killed by you
Want to try a cookie?
do it yourself
Now, I have a suggestion . . . . .
These are nothing but an empty, lonely woman 's fantasy that proves nothing at all
The only reason the police haven 't caught you
that they have no reason to doubt you but once they find out
MARTHA blackmailed ANGELA - -
No, it 's MARYALICE - -
What do you want?
same as you
You want to get out of here, change your name and start over in a faraway place
If you 're so sure why don 't you give me away?
Because ZACH will never forgive me
And it 's important that we both help each other because now he 's going to start living with me
What?
Your luggage is packed
You 'll be a fugitive in no time
Do you want your son to live this life?
Every night in a different city
Do not
you can be a better father
I can 't leave him
You stole him so he can live a better life
It 's a noble move, PAUL - - really
It 's time for you to be noble again
Can I at least say goodbye to him?
Did you allow me to say goodbye to MARTHA?
Hello
I am looking for KENDRATAYLOR .
sorry, you have to leave
you don 't understand
Look, I can 't just leave
please get back to the car
Look, BOB, let me try to explain
Please explain in the car
Look, the thing is - - this could be... my last chance to figure out why I can 't be with the man I love
- Madam- - - BOB, I can 't explain it to you
how important this is to me
So I 'm going into that room and you 'll allow me
Do you know why?
 'Cause in that huge chest behind that uniform that could crush me like a fly
have a heart
a heart that believes in love
go back to the car
It 's not my fault that you don 't have love in your life
S U S A N ?
Hello KENDRA . Apart from these evidences
these things that are put in front of me
I don 't think the story is over
Sounds stupid right?
No, no, of course not.
Unfortunately, that 's the whole story.
But MIKE 's lawyers think it 's self-defense if that 's the case--
DELFINO sold black carbon heroin to my daughter
He killed the cop who tried to get him found guilty and punished
This is the end of the story Dad--
she should hear the truth
no matter how bad
I 'm so sorry, Ms. MAYER. I 'm really sorry

I appreciate you talking to me
What does this mean?
If she knew the truth, she 'd go back to him
She would persuade him to give up his job.
I can 't take this risk
I 'm out of time
Come on, get past that corner
we have to talk
What do you think, REX? I chose green,
In this way, GABRIELLE is a good match for both boys and girls
very beautiful what 's wrong?
you 've been gloomy all day
Feel sorry
I 'm just worried about the test results
I 'm going to lose my mind if I don 't figure out where I am right now
oh dear
You must be tired of listening to me complain, no, no

I think we should talk
In fact, I don 't think we communicate enough
right
Why don 't we do things together anymore? like husband and wife
Well, I think you get better as soon as you get sick
we should go on vacation
to travel, to an interesting place
Remember the last time we went to Italy?
remember little by little
Don 't you remember those beautiful foods?
And the gorgeous scenery and--
I just remember sweating like a fat pig and hoping I won 't spend all my savings hahaha
Where do you want to go?
it doesn 't matter
you decide
Kendra : MIKE did not deal drugs?
DIERDRE
Mike , he quit early
But DIERDRE can 't quit. . . or doesn 't want to quit. I don 't know
But, she lost control and kept going in and out of prison
One day, an undercover cop caught her on drugs
He forced her to trade her body for freedom
Look, Mike finds out what he 's trying to stop
He burst into the middle of the two and he--
The cop pointed the gun at him
Mike fights him
they hit the balcony
Mike was the only one who came back
It 's self-defense
Yes
Mike went to jail to save my sister
but he didn 't
I know he 's a good guy
I know
Thank you
Mary Alice : The oath is simple, really.
People swear to be together forever no matter what the circumstances . . . rich or poor. . .
sick or not . .
Be proud of each other, cherish each other. . .
give up everything else . . .
until death separates us.
Yes, the oath is simple
It 's hard to find someone who is worthy of the oath
But if we can find it, we 'll live happily ever after
