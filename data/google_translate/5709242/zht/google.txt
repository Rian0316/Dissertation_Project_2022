Josh Peters left it for me
He got into a fight with me in crafting class

what a jerk
'What an asshole'

I still live with her in Syracuse

Sometimes he doesn 't even recognize who I am when he looks at me

my mom and i even . . .
I don 't know how to talk to her
I 'm not that close to her
I don 't know what to start with
That 's why I 'm leaving That 's why I started this trip Just to get away
Make as many memories as possible while I can
I know I have to talk to her after all I have to . . .
But don 't talk like that I just...
i will handle it
I 'll take care of it when I get back I 'll . . .

'Recruit Thrill Seekers'

Well, four-star pay is a big deal. Not bad.
Recruiting thrill-seekers Saito Gaming Team Berkshire, UK is a bit far from the city
is some kind of playtest
To a man named Saito . . .

Saito Tour . . .
- Saito Games - Saito Games That 's Right
That 's a big company
- really big - really
horror game

you have heard. . .
Which one of them came out with 'The Phantom of Harlech'
'The Phantom of Harlem'
I was in seventh grade at my buddy David Ludwig 's
played in the basement
That is Saito Sho is his company
Saito Sho is afraid of him
- He 's a genius and super mysterious. - Okay.
They are working on a new project
Invested a lot of money, unprecedented breakthrough, but no one knows what it is
if i do well
Maybe I can get you an exclusive interview with Xiang
How about 'Xiang Ji', you should take a picture, seriously, if you can take it
anything they are working on
That 's a lot more money than a four-star salary, okay?
where is this place



Mr. Copper
Halleck Phantom
Just call me Cooper
sorry mr cooper
just call me Cooper
If that 's the case, just call me Katie


- follow me - ok
- I 'll get my luggage - Laffer will take care of it

This way

I feel like I 'm about to meet Dumbledore.
Hoping for a Gryffindor, I 'm taking your phone
and other tools that can send and receive signals
- A little paranoid.- Be careful sailing the boat
ok for you

You are so suspicious

really white
I guess it says
Do I agree to have a kidney taken?
It 's actually a standard nondisclosure agreement and a disclaimer or something.
All right
It 's important to tell you
we need a minor surgery

Sorry for the playtest?
It 's not permanent and we won 't take your kidney
- I promise - well less damage than piercing

Sonia

what to do


- it 's alright - it 's alright
We study an interactive augmented reality system
- just like virtual reality - adding layers to reality

All right


- what is that - we call this mushroom

- like in Mario Bros. - so to speak
Do you have the appropriate qualifications?
I haven 't killed anyone so far
OK
Okay

All right
- That 's it - I told you I 'm great


don 't worry it 's not permanent

All right
Is this some kind of memory test or something?
- We 'll know when the time comes. - Okay.
You may have a slight tingling sensation at first startup okay?

Starts at 5:38
- are you ready - ready sir

almost done
Mom calls
I thought I turned it off




Done and you feel alright
great
- looking at the round pad - ok



This . . . what did you see

picture. . .

like a gopher in a video game
- isn 't it more delicate now - yes
That 's right

- now - fuck
fuck it right there . . .
It 's right there . . . I can . . .

It 's not really just a consciousness projection
- you can see it I can 't - you can 't see it


All right
hit it
Just hit it





Well it 's like whack-a-mole
I 've played it countless times

Okay

let 's get started


where are you coming from
no no
Do not





ok don 't come out
All right
Surrender
Have a good time, have a good time, you are so cute

ok bye bye bye
- Is that so - I 'm afraid so

Are these gophers two-dimensional or three-dimensional?
three-dimensional no no no
Super 3D is like . . .
- this is just a partial test demo - just a demo
I think you should go further
Test the full experience of our research
Of course it will give you more money if you want to play
hmmmm
i play i play

This is Saito Sho


Are you the new volunteer tester?
this is awesome
I would say that gopher game is super fun
super fun


- interesting- interesting
just be interesting
good game
your heart beat faster
- you 'll laugh - yeah
yeah or scream harleck phantom

I 've always liked making players jump
If you are scared, you will jump when you are scared
- you 'll feel great afterwards - yes you 'll be radiant
why


Because of the adrenaline rush - that 's right - yeah
But mostly because you 're still alive
You faced your deepest fears in a safe environment
It 's the release of fear that sets you free
yeah so right
what we are currently researching
is the most personal horror survival game ever made

sharp
Use your own thinking to scare you
That . . . sounds crazy
can 't wait
I am uploading the neural network package
Neural Network Package Neural Network
You should improve the name. This name is too outdated.
I 'm joking about a good name
This is cutting edge smart software that learns and adapts as it runs it monitors your brain activity
Deduce the way that scares you the most
Then adjust to your experience
- Are you ready - Alright Star Trek meme send me go get it ready to launch
please close your eyes
- It 's now 6:17 pm - ok
uploading
May Fourth
three two one

how do you feel




good everything is fine
stand up slowly

Are you ready to play the game


Isn 't this the house of The Phantom of Harlem?
It 's part of the estate, it 's actually the gatekeeper 's hut, but that 's the prototype
We copied the furnishings and scanned the construction for the game
so cool

how to play the game what should i do
you don 't have to do anything
you just stay here alone
See how long you can hold on before you 're too scared to hold on
I just need to stay here
Then you 'll get paid and I 'll be watching you in the control room
There are cameras everywhere, no stealing
and this

- ok what 's this - it 's headphones
put in the ear
So we can be in touch anytime
That 's cool - if I talk to you you can hear - yeah
awesome
Nothing you see can really hurt you
It 's all audio-visual and virtual, as good as whack-a-mole
But if it gets too intense we can pull you out anytime
- call off the experiment - ok
Can you think of any safe words
easy-to-remember words in distress
what about the word 'stop'
- 'stop' when you choose well - good
Okay, let you enjoy the night alone
- Okay - I 'll get back to you in a moment
feel free
take it easy


Halleck . . . Phantom




Is it true is it true it is really dead



Cooper
- can you hear - clear
I see you 've begun to borrow alcohol to strengthen your courage.

- But the wine is probably non-alcoholic. - That sucks.

we need you to clear your mind
ok that makes sense

This is so beautifully crafted
yes woodworking is exquisite


- This is what I drew - perfect score for observation

All right




- annoying- what 's wrong
I just forgot I didn 't have my phone I kept going to get it forgot it wasn 't in my pocket
And there 's no TV here so . . .
- Welcome back to the 19th century - Hmm
No TV No Internet No Wi-Fi
yeah no wonder people see the mess
Probably just out of boredom
This is the dominant theory to explain haunting
Hallucinations occur when the brain is less stimulated
The fewer distractions, the easier it is for people to see ghosts
It 's great to know this

but they have literature to read
Really sweet collection of short stories
gosh
I don 't even remember when was the last time I read a book
Think about people who used to read books on purpose
Crow
Yeah, it 's crazy why?
- I don 't think I . . . - be quiet
I gotta immerse myself in this old-fashioned activity to concentrate
Feel sorry


I mean your heart rate just picked up
Of course it will, because there 's a huge spider here
you saw a spider
- you can 't see it - can 't see
don 't climb over


Oni
A strong man like you is afraid of spiders
i just don 't like them
- it soon found out that you are afraid of spiders - jeez
it 's looking for weaknesses
The death
asshole
Great


All right
All right
More real than whack-a-mole
Really awesome image processing done well
fine
Really boring




- what 's the matter - just
it 's okay no problem
I 'm looking at the painting and there 's a . . . not a light on the painting
Here . . .
can you advance the lens


Then you can see what I 'm talking about
- Cooper . . . - Now there is a . . .
there 's someone in the window that 's not...
All right

Now he 's gone and there 's no one in the window
This. . .

Well there is . . .
The pipe is leaking


I knew it was a leaking pipe
Oni

Hold


All right

you scared me
what did you see
there 's a creepy guy
oh my god . . .

oh my god


He 's kind of like Josh Peters
- Josie Peters you are Josie Peters - what
You 're Josie Peters from high school, someone I knew in high school, the system for building
may be mining some of your memory
Is Josie Peters the one you fear
He 's a bully I 'm not afraid I 'm not afraid of him but he 's a bully and
Omg some Israeli martial arts lessons
i 'm ready
it 's ready


God of Destruction
I 'm going to have a drink and fight
I want to pour you some too, but you probably won 't be able to drink it, so

see you later peters
This non-alcoholic drink is awesome
I 'm no expert but it 's delicious
I was in a vineyard when I went to France
One of their grape stomping festivals has wine
That wine is delicious, I 'm sure
you 're rambling
- What is rambling - ramble
incoherent
is this the problem
People talk more when they are afraid
Helps compensate for fear
- It 's also a cover-up - right?
Similar to when you turn on the TV late at night the sound can make you less lonely
even if you are alone
You can 't scare my Katie
Pity
Is there a refrigerator here?
some snacks in the closet
OK
let me see
found it
Ginger Shortbread

Check it out, that 's it
All right. . .
He must be behind me when I close, right?
yes that 's it

I knew suddenly scary was out of date


Hold
gosh
- what the fuck is that - what did you see?
Oni
One of the dead ...
hard to describe
big spider
There 's a face dick sticking out of the mouth
yes . . . peters peters in it
like peters
Combination of spiders
Katie is this yours or me
it 's all you
I 'm so fucked up
Heck you 're so disgusting
Hey
sorry can you say it again
Hello Katie
Damn Katie
Just say something when you 're online again
I 'm not afraid it 's just... boring
is that you



come in to fix the earphones? that 's a good idea
coming

Hold


bring it on
you are in danger
Sonia

It 's just like that, it 's unbelievable
It 's amazing. I 'm totally obsessed with it.
I really . . .
You look so real, you look exactly like her
real
It 's a pity you 're not




- Cooper, what are you doing - wait a minute
- Cooper, you 're in danger. - Don 't talk, I have to think.
you 're so fucking real you 're so real

- Cooper you - you are Sonia and you are really here
- are you really here - i am really here
- jeez - we have to go - you have to listen to me - how did you get here do you remember the picture you sent me
I did some research and found out that Sho Saito got an item last year
Computer human brain interface patent
How could you be real I don 't . . .
Well fuck me no . . . they brought you here
You are really the ones who brought you here
They are trying to make me want to be beautiful
I see it 's part of the test
His patent was rejected outright
People say it 's crazy and dangerous
Really? how much do they pay you?
Seriously because you 're acting so well now
what did they feed you sorry i thought you were fake
But now I know you 're real
I 'm such a bad master
I 've got a non-alcoholic drink, maybe a drink will set the mood

Cooper I want to take you . . .
let 's go into the kitchen
- Cooper- Sonya, take it easy
Stop making trouble, you were seen through by me, stop pretending
Cooper has other secrets. Five people went missing last year.

all passengers
All registered on that broken gig app
oh my god it 's crazy whatever they 're doing to you what they 're doing to you
It 's all dangerous. We have to leave Cooper right now.

ok ok ok
- If what you say is true - Cooper
- so how did you find me - what
how do you know where i am
This is a game company I checked the address
Really
No how did you find it here
- i tracked you - tracked me
Just use the 'find a friend' function to check the satellite location of your phone. 'find a friend' was rounded up by you, but they took my phone
And the phone is in a building miles away
It 's revealing
That 's right
It is said that women 's IQ crushes men 's singularity.
i just wanted to say
I think you could have made the story a little better to be interesting . . .
ok don 't be angry
Have you ever wondered how your bank account got hacked
what are you doing
- I copied your card while you were asleep - okay
Put the knife down, what are you doing with the knife?
It 's me who brought this job to your attention
Sonia, put the knife down, okay? It 's not fun.
You should have called your mom Cooper
- But you contacted me - Sonia
I brought you here again
- listen to me - like breadcrumbs leading the way
Put down the knife and stop acting
Seriously put the knife down Sonya
This is no fucking fun. Put the knife away...
I 'm not here for the knife, I 've had enough, okay?
I go
I go
what the hell


I go

I went

stop

oh my god i feel it
I got stabbed in the arm
- On my shoulder - Cooper, who did you see?
- fuck. . . sonia- who
Sonia is a girl I know
her mother stabbed me
- She also got a knife - you won 't hurt Cooper
- no no no I can touch her - that 's impossible
she . . i got stabbed i don 't know
Nothing you see touches or hurts you
Just pure audiovisual virtual
- I won 't feel any body.- How come I don 't feel any body during exercise?
Cooper, you need to calm down, I feel it, okay?
I feel her arms and body temperature
I also felt her stab me in the shoulder
- it can 't be - my god
- That 's impossible, Cooper. - It 's true.
It should be impossible to feel
- unless - my god unless something
I don 't know that the neural network maybe through some mechanism
- Created somatosensory perception - I go
- but this has never been done before - oh my god
I tell you to stop the game now
I quit, get me out
Stop, stop, did you hear the safety word?
- ok let 's figure it out - oh my god
No, I 'll dig this thing out now
Cooper, don 't pull it out yourself
It is very dangerous to remove the device yourself
stop you will die
calm down
Is that Xiang?
Is it Xiang? What did he say? What did he say?
Alright Cooper, we 're going to start the exit process.
That 's great
we need you to obey
Go to the access point
The access point is great where is this broken access point

- I 'm going to go upstairs please. - Last floor.
- trust me - all right

Turn left on the top floor
- which door - the room at the end
What 's up

There 's something bad in there, I can feel it
- like . . . - what
personal shit
I can feel this thing in my head poking Cooper to open the door
Probably my mother maybe . . . dead
- your mother - hanging from the beam
- your mother 's not in there - you can 't control it
it 's in my head it knows
- it knows - knows what
know what happened between me and my mom
Cooper, I promise your mother isn 't in there
- open the door - oh my god
Only then can I pick you up and listen to me
ok ok
No matter what 's in the room it won 't hurt you
But I can 't get you out unless you open the door. Cooper
please open the door quickly
open open


All right
Okay, I 'm in the room, where 's the access point?
Access Point
- no access point at all - what
I 'm teasing you Cooper
I let you climb here just to see if you 'll break down
unconditional obedience to orders
- we did it - no no no
Katie don 't do this Katie please let me out
What the hell is Katie letting me out?
what are you gonna do what are you gonna do to me
- why did you do that - you thought you 'd see your mother
- fuck- what does she look like
your mother can you describe her appearance
her hair color or something
she
she is tall and thin
- where did you grow up - she . . .
Your Favorite Band 's Favorite Ice Cream Flavors
the name of the girl who stabbed you
You can 't remember it all, can you?
don 't you think it 's strange
it took my memory away
Strictly speaking, it covers
look in the mirror behind you
do you still recognize yourself
do you know who the person in the mirror is

Soon you 'll be nothing like your father

They shouldn 't have been inserted so deeply
straight through your brain
Take control of a large area I can 't stop
I can 't take it out I can 't stop it
But I don 't know who I am
i don 't know who i am

i don 't know who i am i forgot
