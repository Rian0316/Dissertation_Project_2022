That 's Saito Shoyu, that 's his company

Apparently they are working on a new program
Investing large sums of money, unprecedented innovation, but keeping it secret
Maybe if I get it right I can give you exclusive access to Xiangyu

White (Saito Games)

It 's actually a standard nondisclosure agreement.
Okay
It is important that you understand that minor surgery will be involved

Sorry, does the game need it?
Not forever We won 't steal your kidneys, I promise
It 's almost like having your ear pierced' Confidential Information
The brain downloads the game, the duration expires . . . '

what the hell?
(What the hell is there a medical procedure?)

What we 're developing is an augmented reality system

Okay

- The one in 'Super Mario Bros'? - you can say that
- Are you qualified to do such a thing? - I haven 't killed anyone yet
Is it ok?
Okay

finished

yes, that 's right

Damn it, it 's there . . . can I touch it?



It 's not real, it 's some kind of psychological reflex
- You can see it, I can 't - can 't you?
Yes. . .

All right
hit it hard
Hit it hard? Okay





Well, it 's like a game of whack-a-mole
I 've played it a million times, ok

Okay

come up


Where are you coming from?


where did you go?

ok, don 't come up
ok, received
so much fun . . . you are so cute

- Okay, bye, gone? - I 'm afraid so

Are gophers flat or upright . . .
Stereoscopic not . . . stereo, super stereo, like . . .

I think you should experience the full version of the system we are developing
Of course the pay is higher, if you are interested
Yes . . I am interested . . .

This is Saito Shoyu

This is really great, hello . . .
I want to say that the whole game is super fun
Super fun


fun? fun is good
It 's good to play games, the heartbeat will be faster


- also smiles - yes
yes, or... .
Scream (Haleck Ghost)

I always like to make players jump
frightened, jumping up when scared
- It 'll feel good after that - yeah
you will shine
Why?


because of the adrenaline rush
- yes- that is
But mostly because you 're still alive
You face your deepest fears in a safe environment
This is the release of fear, it will free you
Yes, that 's right, what we 're working on right now
The most personal survival thriller game ever made
great
Use your own thoughts to scare you
Sounds . . . crazy
can 't wait
- I 'm uploading via network packets - neural network packets . . .

It might take a while to understand that it 's all 90 's stuff
Just kidding, the name is well made
This is state-of-the-art smart software that learns quickly and adapts to monitor your brain activity
Try to find out what scares you the most
Then adjust your experience accordingly
- Are you ready? - Okay - let 's go, okay, you 're ready - close your eyes

- The current time is 6:17pm - ok
Uploading 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

how do you feel?




- Feeling fine, normal - Okay, stand up slowly

Ready to start playing?


- Isn 't this the 'Haleck Ghost' house? - This is part of the entire estate
It 's actually the gamekeeper 's house, but that 's right, that 's the model
Scan the structure according to the game replication pattern
very cool. . .

what game is this? What should I do?
You don 't have to do anything just stay here alone
see how long you can last until you 're too scared to go on
So I just stay here? Got money?
I 'll be watching from the back control room
There are cameras everywhere, no stealing silverware
and this

- what is this? - walkie-talkie
Yes, once we put it on, we can stay connected the whole time
so cool
I can talk to you, will you hear? marvelous
Nothing you see can hurt you
It 's all audio-visual effects like whack-a-mole
very good
But if the effect is too severe, we can get you out at any time
- stop experimenting - ok
Do you have any security code in mind?
Words that are easy to remember under stress?
- How about 'stop'? - good choice, then 'stop'


Okay, so let 's enjoy tonight
- ok- you 'll hear me later
- Make this your home. - Okay, don 't be too hard on yourself.


Halleck Ghost




is this real? yes, really dead . . .



- Cooper- hello
- Can you hear me? - clear
I 've been thinking about drinking to be brave.
- but those wines don 't contain alcohol - that sucks

- we need you to stay awake - makes sense

This technology is really superb, amazing first-class woodworking

- that 's right here - amazing observation

everything is right




- Damn - what 's wrong?
I just forgot I didn 't have my phone
Still looking, I forgot not in my pocket
no tv here
Welcome to the 19th century without TV, internet and wireless
No wonder they 're seeing dirty stuff, maybe it 's hallucinations
This is the heck of a major theory
The mind will be confused when there is no external stimulus
The fewer distractions, the more ghosts people see. Really useful information.

But there are books to read
It 's kind
Omg, I can 't remember when was the last time I read a book
( ' Crow' )
Thinking that people in the past would still pick up books to read
I know, it 's crazy, why?
- You know, I feel like I 'm . . .
- Okay
I want to retro, just concentrate
Excuse me


Can I say your heart is beating faster?
Yes, it should, because there is an oversized spider
Did you see a spider?
- You didn 't see that? - no
don 't . . . come over . . .


- Damn- a tough guy like you is afraid of spiders?
I just don 't like spiders
The system quickly finds out that you have arachnophobia and it 's spying on your weaknesses
damn
go to hell
Long live


Okay
That 's right
It 's a lot more real than a game of whack-a-mole
Great, the image is very realistic
good, yes
Well, that 's not scary enough




What 's up?
Just . . . nothing . . . seems to have . . .


No, there 's a light on
exist. . .
Can you pull the lens here? So you know what I 'm talking about


- Cooper- now has . . .
There 's a person in the window, no . . .


He 's gone now, the window is gone now
This is. . .

yes, yes. . .
It 's just a leaking water pipe


I knew it was a leaking pipe
dying
damn


Okay

you scared me . . .
- what did you see? - spooky weirdo
Incredible . . .

oh my god



He looks just like Josh Peters
- You are Josh Peters . . .
- what? You are Josh Peters from high school, my friend from high school
The system may mine some of your private memories
Was Josh Peters the guy you dreaded in high school?
He 's a bully, I 'm not afraid of him. . . I 'm not afraid of him, but he 's a bully. . .
Gosh, if I get a few more Israeli close-quarters classes I 'll be ready . . .
I 'll be ready


Kalima

I want some wine, I 'll give it to you but I don 't think you can drink it
See you later, Peters
This non-alcoholic beer is delicious
I 'm no expert, but this is good stuff
I 've been to France and lived in a vineyard
They have a wine . . . from the stomping festival
That wine is really good, I know
you 're rambling
- What is gossiping? - talkative
small talk
Is this a problem?
Some people talk more when they are afraid
able to compensate for fear
- Can also hide fear - can it?
Sounds like turning on the TV late at night will make you feel less lonely
even if you are alone
You can 't scare me, Katie
it 's a pity
- Is there a refrigerator or something here? - There are some snacks in the cupboard
Okay, the pawn point will point to . . .
Hello 's
ok, gingerbread cookies

I 'll take a look, that 's it

If I close the door, he will show up in the back, right?
Yes, that 's the rule

I 've known for a long time that sudden shocks are no longer...

damn
gosh
- What the hell is that? - what did you see?
enough bullshit
one . . .
hard to explain
A big human-faced spider with its mouth sticking out
It 's . . Peters is in it . . .
like a fusion of peters and spiders
God, Katie, are you kidding or am I hallucinating?
I think it 's your hallucination
My super messed up god damn it
Damn, you 're disgusting enough
Sorry, can you say that again?

Katie, are you there?
Damn, Katie
Anyway . . . just say it when you 're on the line
You know I 'm not afraid, just bored
Is that you?



Want to fix the headphones? this might be a good idea
right

damn


open soon
you are in danger
Sonia?

That 's right, it 's amazing
It 's a great set, I admire it
I. . .
you look so real
You look like she 's awesome
just . . . it 's a pity you 're not



- etc. . .
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Cooper, you 're in danger - be quiet . . . I need to think
you are super real . . .

- Cooper, you . . .
- Sonia, you 're really here
- Are you really here now? - I 'm real, I 'm really here
We have to leave, you have to listen to me how are you here? Do you remember that photo you sent me?
I looked into it and apparently Saito Shoyu applied last year
A patent for a computer-brain interaction system
How can you be real? I don 't... well, damn...
The you they brought you here is real, they brought you here

They want to mess with me, it 's a clever trick . . .
I see, this is part of the test
His patent was rejected on the spot and they said it was crazy and dangerous

Yeah? How much do they pay you?
Really, because you played Cooper so well, did they give you anything?
sorry i thought you were fake
But now I know you 're real I didn 't treat you well
I have some non-alcoholic drinks that might help us relax a bit

Cooper, what I want to do is . . .
- Let 's go to the kitchen and talk - Cooper
Sonia, take it easy, okay?
Give it up, you are showing off, stop acting
Listen, Cooper, it 's not over, five people went missing last year
It 's all tourists, they 're all registered in that stupid engineering style
Yeah? That 's horrible no matter what they 're doing to you or what they 've done to you
It 's all dangerous, we really need to go, Cooper

Okay. . .
- if what you say is true . . .
- Cooper
- So how did you find me? - what?
How did you know about this place?
This is the game company, I found the address
Yeah?
no . . . how did you find me here? this place
I follow you - you follow me? - Yes, using your phone 's satellite positioning
'Find My Friends' feature . . . seems to make sense but they take my phone
And that place is about 1. 5 km from here
That 's a good move, Brilliant.
Stop saying that women are smarter than men. 'Odd' is wrong
listen, i just said
You should be able to come up with better stories
Can be funny, or . . . ok. . . don 't get mad

Have you ever wondered why your bank account was hacked?
what are you doing?
I copy your credit card while you sleep
OK, put the knife down, what are you doing with the knife?
I deliberately let you find this job
Sonia, put down that damn knife, okay? it 's not funny
You should call your mother, Cooper

- But you called me - Sonia
I lead you here
- do you know? - Breadcrumb path
Put down the knife, stop right now
Well, seriously, put the knife down, Sonia
Not funny
put the knife down
That 's not what I 'm here for. I 'm not playing anymore, okay?
damn
damn
What are you doing?


damn
damn

hateful

stop
stop

damn
damn

damn





Cooper

- Katie Cooper, what happened?
What just happened?
What 's wrong? we keep talking
- you haven 't answered - you said i wouldn 't feel anything

- Damn, she 's gone - who 's gone?
God, I feel it
There 's a knife in my arm
- Into my shoulder - Cooper, who 's been there?
- Damn, Sonia - who?
Sonia, she 's the damn girl I know. . . she stabbed me
- She 's got a knife - nothing can hurt you, Cooper
- no . . . she 's real - no, she can 't be
She . . . I was stabbed, I know
Nothing you see can hurt you or even touch you
This is purely audiovisual
- No physical perception - Damn, obviously there is
- Cooper, you have to be calm - I know, because I feel it, understand?
I touch her arm, it 's hot I feel her thrust into my shoulder
- it can 't be - my god
- It 's impossible, Cooper- It 's possible. . .
Entity perception should not happen
- Unless. . . - God, unless what?
I don 't know, a neural network might find out
- some way of replicating physical experience - dammit
- but this is the first time - oh my god
OK, you know what? stop this game
I 'm quitting, get me out of here right now . . . safety code damn stop
- ok . . . we 'll deal with that - oh my god
No, I 'm about to quit this shit
Cooper, don 't try to take it out on your own
Self-removal is extremely dangerous
stop, it could kill you, keep calm

Is that Saito?
Is that Saito? what did he say. . .
- Okay, Cooper - what did he say? we 're going to start dismantling
good news
we want you to follow the instructions
- Arrive at the meeting point - ok
Meeting point? Great, where 's the damn rendezvous?

- Damn, and stairs? please - one more floor up
- trust me - good

top left turn
- OK, which door? - the bottom room
What 's wrong?

There must be something behind the door, I can feel it
- like . . .
- Like what? some personal worst memories
Like . . . I don 't know, but I can feel it digging into my brain
Cooper, open the door
must be my mom
- I don 't know, dead - your mother?
- hanging from the boom and rocking - your mother 's not in it
It 's not something you can control
It 's in my head, it all knows . . .
- it knows - what does it know?
It knows I have a crush on my mom
Cooper, I assure you she 's not in there
- now go open the door - oh my god
It 's the only way I can get you out of here Listen to me
well . . . damn
Nothing inside can hurt you
But I can 't get you out unless you open the door, Cooper
- Could you open the door, please? - bring it on. . .

Okay
Okay . . . I 'm in the room, where 's the meeting point?
Meeting point?
- No rendezvous - what?
I 'm kidding you, Cooper
I just want to see if we 've made you miserable enough
Can follow instructions without objection
- Seems to be a success - no . . .
Katie, please . . . let me out
Katie, let me out, please, what are you doing?
What are you going to do? what are you doing to me?
- Why are you doing this? - you thought you 'd meet your mother
- Damn- what does she look like?
Your mother, can you describe what she looks like?
her hair color?
Is she tall, short, fat, thin?
where did you grow up?
Which band do you like best? What 's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
What 's the name of the girl who stabbed you?
You don 't know these things, do you? Don 't you think it 's weird?
- It 's stealing my memory - Reshaping, strictly speaking
- Damn - look in the mirror behind you
Do you recognize yourself?
Do you know who you are looking at?

You 'll be nothing soon You 'll be like your dad



- To shut up. . .
- Are you afraid of this?
- To shut up. . .
- you are following in his footsteps
To shut up. . .
- you 're not going anywhere - shut up . . .
You should call your mom, she 's yours
- you dumped her - no . . .
get out of my head
- get out of my head now - stop talking to her
Get out of my head now . . .
Get out of my head now

Get out of my head now Cooper, I 'm going to shut down, okay? I just need to connect
get out of my head
get out of my head . . .
where am i?
Who are you?
- Who are you? - I can 't stop

I don 't know who I am, so I 'm going home
The data of this interface spreads like roots and they stick deeper than expected
Get into the brain, take over the whole area I can 't stop it
I can 't take it out, I can 't stop it
But I don 't know who I am
i don 't know who i am

i don 't know who i am
On behalf of the Saito Games team, I would like to express my deepest apologies to you

Do not. . .
stop . . .
stop . . . don 't. . .
do not want. . .
stop . . .
damn
Just a second
Either he is super sensitive to the system or the software effect is too strong
Jump from 0 to 1 8 0 0 0 in 5 milliseconds
Sorry, the experience was stronger than expected, Mr. Cooper
hope you can forgive us

All luggage is under the front seat now please turn off all electronics and collect
as they may interfere with flight and communication systems

mom?

mom?

i have to call him



Why is Cooper leaving?
- I. . .
- Mom, here I am

- I 'm right here, Mom- I have to call Cooper
I have to call to make sure he 's safe
I have to call him . . .

mom?


mom. . .
(Mom calls)
mom. . .
(Mom calls) - What happened? - His phone rang - didn 't you take it? - Yes, but . . .
- Signal harassment- I know I 'm off
maybe he did something when i left the room
A momentary negligence, the next is not an example
This dial-in signal must have interfered with all the synapses on his brain, all of a sudden, all of a sudden and dead, like this
You say he shouted, what did he shout?
mom
- write it down - yes
(Cubrey Field Test Time: 0.04 seconds) (Failure Reason: Cell Phone Signal Interference) (Observation)
(Has called 'Mom')
