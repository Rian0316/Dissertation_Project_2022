 [ school bell rings ]

 [ woman ] Hey , you gonna try out ?
 [ car horn honks ]
 [ laughter ]

 [ laughter ]
 - So how was school ?
 - Uh , OK , I guess .
 [ man ] Those guys back there , friends of yours ?
 Uh , I don 't know , they kind of haven 't spoken to me yet .
 It 'll get better , OK ?
 You 're still the new kid , you just need a little time to settle in .
 Everyone will be so friendly , it 's such a good neighborhood .
 It is a good neighborhood .
 Like you would know .
 You spend all your time in your dungeon , working on your ground- breaking mousetrap alternative .
 - [ man ] Oh , hey ... - [ music in earphones ]
 [ song echoing , fading out ]
 [ On TV ] [ muffled music continues ] [ man sighs ]








 Yes .


 - I see you singing along .
 - [ applause ]
 - What 's up ? We got Ashley O in the house .
 - [ audience cheers ]

 -
 -

 Yeah , you know , they 're kind of in my mind while I 'm sleeping and so when I wake up I have to really quickly write it down
 ' cause I don 't want it to just disappear .

 [ Busy ]
 [ Ashley O ]

 Now , your aunt , she 's kind of the source of a lot of your confidence , right ?
 - Like she 's your mentor .
 - [ Ashley O ] Yeah , you know , she 's taken care of me my whole life and she 's my manager .

 [ whispers ] Mention the doll .
 Actually , the reason I 'm here is ...


 Watch .


 - [ Busy ]

 - [ Busy ] - [ Ashley Too ]

 [ Busy laughs ]
 [ Ashley O ]




 The commercial , yeah , I think we 're ready to run that now .
 Fire it up .
 Let 's do it .
 [ man ]
 - [ girl ]

 [ man ]


 Jesus Christ .
 [ Ashley Too ]
 [ man ]
 I was thinking this one for Instagram .
 Yeah , you always pick a good one .
 [ Ashley 's aunt ] They love Ashley Too on social .
 [ distant cheering ]
 - [ rock music plays in club ] - [ excited chatter ]


 [ plays piano ]





 Sorry , didn 't mean to interrupt .
 It 's a nice tune .
 The lyrics are kind of a departure .
 It 's nothing , it 's just a stream of consciousness kind of thing .
 [ exhales ]
 Hey , Ashley , everything OK ?
 Yeah , I 'm fine .
 - You taking your meds ?
 - Yeah , you don 't have to worry about me .
 OK .
 [ chuckles ]
 - Alright , see you at breakfast .
 - See you .
 I 'll ask Amaya to make those eggs you like .
 [ Ashley O ] Thank you .
 [ country music plays on radio ]
 Dad , can I get an Ashley Too ?
 Sorry , a what ?
 An Ashley Too .
 - It 's some dorky Ashley O doll .
 - It 's not a doll .
 - An imaginary friend .
 - For my birthday , please .
 I 'll think about it .
 It 's on Wednesday .
 What is ?
 Her birthday .
 I knew that .
 Oh , my God . [ gasps ]
 Oh , my God .
 [ laughs ]
 - Thank you so much . - [ dad ] You 're welcome .
 [ girl ] It 's so exciting .
 [ laughs ]
 - Ashley , wake up .
 - [ doll chimes ]

 - Uh ...
 Rachel .

 - You , too .
 Oh , my God , I 'm such a huge fan .


 - I 'm 15 today .


 [ Rachel chuckles ] Thank you .

 Just Jack , she 's over there .
 - Hi , fuck face .

 Just ignore her , Ashley .



 Um ... Well , my dad 's Kevin .
 My mom was called Genevieve .
 Everyone called her Gen.
 She died a couple of years back .


 That 's very kind .

 Uh , into as in ... ?

 Oh , well , um , since we moved ,
 I ... don 't exactly have many friends .


 Uh ...
 A little later , maybe .

 Sure .
 [ music plays ]
 [ chuckles ]
 Ashley , stop .
 - Jack . - [ Jack ] You know I hate that shit .
 - [ Rachel ] Leave her alone . - Her ?
 It 's my birthday , I wanna listen , put your headphones on .
 Whatever .
 [ Rachel ] Sorry about that , Ashley .

 - Sure .
 - [ music plays ]


 So , like , where did the inspiration for " On A Roll " come from ?


 - Of course .


 That 's so cool .
 OK , be back in a moment , just gonna run to the bathroom .

 Miss you .
 [ plucks strings to muffled music on headphones ]
 [ rock music plays ]
 [ music stops ]

 I wasn 't playing for you .

 Not your kind of music .

 - You wouldn 't have heard of it .

 OK .
 Pixies , Sonic Youth , Idles , Savages .

 [ scoffs ]
 More like vintage .
 My mom was super into them , so ...

 Ashley , go to sleep .
 - [ muffled rock music ]
 - [ plucks guitar ]
 I mean I know I 'm talking about next year , but I ... [ sighs ] [ Catherine ] Guys , I 'm at a loss .

 I 've got tour venues earmarked , marketing spend locked in .
 We 're talking sunk costs .
 Ashley Toos haven 't recouped yet , the current sales cycle is starting to dampen , and we are way behind on the next album .
 Behind as in ... ?
 [ Catherine ] As in " I don 't have a single song yet " behind .
 So Ashley hasn 't written anything for the next album ?
 [ Catherine ] Nothing usable .
 Well , if she 's feeling under- creative , there are some mild hallucinogens I can recommend , all organic .

 Munk , the current meds you 've got her on don 't seem to be working .
 You 've seen her , she 's unpredictable .
 The other day I walk in and she 's writing some obtuse bullshit twenty people are gonna relate to and no one is gonna buy .
 She 's Ashley O , not Leonard fucking Cohen .
 She doesn 't understand how fragile all this is .
 You think I should up the dose ?
 [ Catherine ] I don 't know what to do .
 I think I do .
 Go on .
 [ Ashley O hums ]
 [ music plays indoors ]


 - -

 [ laughs ]
 [ Ashley Too ]
 Oh , come on , I dance like a doofus .

 Yeah , yeah , so special no one knows I exist .

 There 's this , um , talent contest at my school next week , singing and dancing .

 Ahh , I don 't know , I don 't think I 'm good enough .

 OK , OK , I 'll do it .
 Um , you gotta help me practice .

 OK .
 One more time .

 - - [ Ashley Too ]

 - - - â™ª - It could be cut short , like this short .
 - [ Ashley Too ] - Yes .
 -
 [ Ashley Too ]
 Did you catch clown disease ?
 What is that shit ?
 It 's just make- up .
 Ashley helped me with it .
 It looks beautiful , sweetheart .
 Are you ready to go ?
 I can do anything if I just believe in myself . [ whispers ] I can do anything if I just believe in myself .
 [ crowd chants ]
 Ashley !
 Ashley !
 Ashley !
 Ashley !
 We got a situation .
 What is it ?
 [ knock on door ]
 - [ Catherine ]
 Ash , honey ?
 - [ knock on door ]
 Are you OK , Ashley ?
 Ashley , can you hear me ?
 Oh , thank God , I thought you were ...
 What happened to your face ?
 Trying out a new look .
 Well , I don 't know that ...
 It might not go with your hair .
 Ashley .
 I heard there was a problem with the costume .
 You don 't like it ? This looks so good on you , every night .
 It feels like I 'm wearing somebody else 's skin .
 Ashley .
 Look .
 You 've got 20, 000 fans out there , waiting to see the you they love .
 Their folks bought them tickets .
 They 're so excited , they 've been waiting for this for months .
 Don 't let them down .

 Knock 'em dead .
 Get makeup in there , now .
 [ exhales ]
 [ audience cheers ]
 [ applause ]
 [ woman ] That was Lenny and Charlie .
 OK , next up , a late entry .
 Dancing to " On A Roll " by Ashley O , it 's Rachel Goggins .
 [ applause ]
 [ music plays ]

 Do you have any idea how long it takes a rodent to die when it 's eaten the poisoned bait in one of these ?
 Your pest control policy needs a serious overhaul , my friend .
 - Man , I 'm just the janitor .
 - [ music continues ]

 - - [ gasps ]
 [ gasping ]
 [ scattered applause ]
 [ cries ]
 I 'm so stupid .
 I messed it all up .
 I 'm sure it wasn 't that bad .
 I let Ashley Too down .
 [ footsteps approaching ]
 Bear put a camera in her dressing room like you asked .
 You 'll want to see this .
 [ Catherine ] What 's she doing ?
 [ Munk ] She 's been stockpiling the meds .
 Also ... there 's this .
 [ pills rattle ]

 [ Kevin ]
 You got your things , uh , for where we 're going , where are we going ?
 [ Rachel ] Yes , I have my swim cap , Dad .
 [ car engine starts ]

 [ exhales ]
 - Where 's Ashley ?
 - I tossed her out .
 Huh ? !
 - Garbage truck came , so I tossed her out .
 - [ Rachel ] What ?
 - [ Jack ] She wasn 't good for you . - Dad !
 - You 're better off without it . - Dad !
 [ Kevin ] I 'm in the middle of something .
 - Jack threw Ashley Too away .
 - It was an intervention .
 That thing was poison .
 You 're gonna buy her a new one .
 Ashley was filling her head with crap .
 She 's the only person who is actually nice to me .
 - She 's not a person .
 - She 's my friend . - Merchandise .
 - Girls , calm down please . - [ Rachel ]
 You 're jealous . - Of a doll ?
 She 's not a doll and she knows me better than you do .
 - I 'm your sister . - You hardly even talk to me .
 - [ Jack ] Bullshit . - Ever since Mom died .
 You shut up .
 It 's true , ever since she died , all you do is mope around with that stupid guitar , which you 're probably no good at
 ' cause you 're too scared to play in front of anyone .
 Yeah , well , at least I 'm not some cookie- cutter cutesy doodle , all because a dolly told me to do it .
 [ imitates Ashley Too ] Hi , I 'm Ashley Too , I 'm your only friend .
 Kiss my feet , kiss my ass ! - I hate you .
 - I hate you , too .
 [ rock music plays on headphones ]
 Gave the kitchen the night off .
 I thought we could have take out , like the old days .
 Sure .
 [ Catherine ] It 's La Mamas .
 I 'll hit the gym extra hard tomorrow .
 No , it 's good to see you enjoying your food .
 I look after you , don 't I ?
 Hm .
 - You 're my manager , so .
 - But you 'd tell me if anything was wrong ?
 I 've been telling you that something is wrong ... for a while .
 [ sighs ]
 It 's getting so hard just to keep doing this .
 - I really wanna do ... - You wanna change your material , I know .

 I hear you .
 I do .
 I 'm sorry , I know how you feel .
 I know what I 'm like , Ashley , I know .
 You feel like I ... don 't listen ,
 like I have too much control over your image , your look , your persona .
 Yeah .
 You don 't trust Dr. Munk .
 You don 't trust me .
 No , it 's ...
 You feel trapped here .
 You feel ... desperate to break away .
 Where did you get that ?
 And , oh , you think you know how .
 What was the plan ?
 OD ?
 Make me look bad ?
 Do you know me at all ?
 Catherine , that 's evidence against you , against Munk .
 All of it .
 I know everything .
 I know precisely what you know .
 There is a wealth of information on this thing .
 You do seem preoccupied with contract law .
 You know , I could have saved you some clicks .
 Your contract 's watertight , it doesn 't expire until you turn 25 .
 Not anymore , not now that you broke laws , Catherine .
 The illegal meds , that puts you in breach , which means that I get an instant break .
 - You eat the rest , I 'm fucking sick . - Sit down , you little ingrate .
 What the fuck did you just call me ?
 Do you know how old I was when your parents died ?
 22 years old .
 Twenty- two , younger than you , but I took you in .
 - It 's my fucking fault . - It 's not your fault .
 But you never once asked me what that was like for me .
 Do you have any idea what I had to give up ? Do you have any conception of that at all ?
 Did you ever wonder ...
 Do you ever look around the fucking house and see where we fucking live because it means I 've worked hard .
 Oh , this is because of you ?
 - Where we live is because of you ?
 - Yes .
 And while you sang your little song and you danced your little dance ...
 Fuck , Catherine .
 Who stood , making sure the lights stay on you ? You can go fuck yourself a thousand fucking times , Catherine ,
 I fucking hate you .
 I fucking hate you .
 - Sit down . - No .
 Because I don 't have to listen to you anymore .
 But you will sit down .
 No , I won 't .
 Yes , you will .
 Do you know what would happen if you did OD on these things ?
 I checked with Dr. Munk .
 You wouldn 't die , you 'd just wind up in a kind of chemical coma .
 At least that 's the theory .
 I powdered your pill stash and put it in your food .
 [ breathes heavily ]
 But don 't worry , your career is gonna hold up just fine .
 Ashley .
 [ distorted ] Go to sleep .
 [ news reporter ]


 [ Kevin ]
 Yes !

 OK ...
 - So , are you ready ?
 - Hm- mm .
 [ Kevin whispers ] Go , Harry .
 [ electrical crackling ]
 [ mouse squeaks ]
 Yes !
 Yes .
 Is it OK ?
 He 's totally fine .
 He 's just stunned , just be out for about 25 minutes .
 Enough time for the homeowner to scoop him up and get him out .
 Is it dead ?
 I need to work on that voltage .

 [ news reporter ]




 So , you lied ?
 I 'm sorry .
 Ra ...
 [ Ashley Too ]



 Ashley , go to sleep .
 [ doll chimes ]
 I 'm sorry .
 [ Jack ] Rachel .
 [ news reporter ]

 I talk to my Ashley Too every day and I swear , when I told her what had happened to the real Ashley ,
 Ashley Too freaked out .
 Uh- uh .
 - [ nurse ]
 I work here .
 - Private session . - [ nurse ]
 No , my shift started ... - Walk away .
 - My shift started ... - Walk away .
 Well , she 's stable .
 That 's actually the creative center .
 A whole lot of activity here .
 We only need ten songs .
 One album , that 's it .
 [ Munk ] It might take a while , her thinking is likely to be disordered .
 [ Catherine ] That gives us time to finesse her replacement .
 Start the body scan .


 [ woman on TV ]
 - - Are you done with that ?
 [ woman on TV ]
 Hey , do you want any ice cream ?
 Dad left enough in the freezer for the whole week .
 [ music in earphones ]
 It 's chocolate fudge brownie .
 Your favorite .
 [ woman on TV ]
 - If you change your mind . - [ TV ]


 Welcome back , still to come , Tusk makes a boo boo on a British TV show and we 'll have the latest on the reboot .

 [ music in earphones ]








 [ Todd ]
 [ washing cycle starts ]
 [ exhales ]
 But incredibly , Ashley 's music career didn 't end there , thanks to a remarkable technological leap .
 We discovered that although we couldn 't communicate with Ashley , we could read her brainwaves
 - using a temporal interceptor . - [ beeps ]
 [ Todd ]
 Music . She was still composing music in her head , in her dreams .
 [ Todd ]

 - [ laptop chimes ] - [ Jackson ] That 's a G- sharp ,
 - that 's an A ... - [ chiming ]
 Another G- sharp .
 It was beautiful .
 It was beautiful .
 [ monitor beeps ] And I just knew there had to be someway to get this out to her fans .
 That 's what she would want .
 [ Todd ]

 [ Catherine ]


 [ Todd ]
 [ Ashley 's voice vocalizing ]
 - So that 's a computer singing ? - Mm- hmm .
 [ Catherine ] Just like the real thing .
 Sorry , it 's so beautiful .

 [ Todd ]
 [ electric crackling ]
 [ garbled sounds ]
 [ garbled ]
 - [ Rachel ]
 Ashley ?
 -
 - Ashley ? -
 Did you turn it back on ? - I didn 't .
 - [ Jack ]
 What 's up with her ? - [ Rachel ] Ashley .
 - [ garbled speech ]
 - [ Jack ] What 's going on ?
 I don 't know .
 - [ both gasp ]
 - Oh !
 [ garbled speech and singing ]
 - [ Jack ] God , what is wrong with her ?
 - I don 't know .

 [ voice falters , fades away ]
 [ Jack ] Oh , my God .
 - Do you know how to use it ?
 - Um ...
 No .
 [ Rachel ] Oh , it 's on .
 What is that ?
 - That ? - [ Rachel ] Yeah .
 I don 't know .
 I don 't think that 's normally there .
 - [ Rachel ]
 So should you do that ? - I have no clue .
 Fuck it .
 [ screams ]
 Oh , my God .


 - Just take it out .
 [ groans ]

 [ laughs ]


 Are you OK ?


 - Limiter ?



 [ sighs ]
 So , you 're really Ashley O ?

 Really , really ?

 - Oh , my God , I 'm such a huge fan . - Rachel , come on , this is bullshit .





 - Alright .
 - I 'm gonna put the limiter back on . -
 - No , leave her alone . -
 Alright , Jesus .
 - Promise . - Promise .
 [ Ashley Too sighs ]
 Fuck .



 [ groans ] [ whispers ]
 You realize that 's not the real Ashley .
 - She says she is .
 - Ashley O doesn 't talk like that .

 No , you don 't , you say things like , " Believe in yourself , you can do anything . "


 - No .
 - Sure .
 [ monitor beeps ]
 [ Catherine ] The investors are going to be there at three .
 - Everything gonna be ready in time ? - Of course .
 [ Catherine ] You said you extracted a song from her overnight . Is that it ?
 [ Jackson ] Yeah , I 've stabilized it and got it playable .
 But it 's not too friendly .
 Let 's hear it .

 Another fucking rage dream .
 Slow it down , see if it 's salvageable .
 Pitch shift ?
 - - Increase the positivity .

 - [ music stops ]
 - OK , we can work with that .
 [ beeping ]
 Oh , quit whining .
 [ beeping stops ]

 [ Ashley Too ]

 That 's horrible .

 - We have to help her . - How ?
 - We could tell someone . - - [ Jack ]
 Like who ? - The cops .
 [ Jack ] We 're just gonna walk into a police station and say that a doll told us that Ashley 's aunt is a monster .

 Show them the brain thing on the computer .
 They 're cops , Rachel , they 're not Google .
 They 're not gonna know what it means .
 - Well , there 's gotta be something . -





 -
 - Yes , of course , anything .
 Hey , we don 't even know where she lives .
 - That 's miles away . - We 'll take you .
 No , we will not .
 Jack .


 - Oh !
 [ gasps ] - [ Ashley Too groans ]


 - Sorry .

 [ grunts ]
 [ sighs ]





 We 're not helping her .
 We are not .
 [ Ashley Too clears throat ]

 Don 't scratch the cup holder . Dad will flip if he knows we took his van .
 I 'm not scratching the cup holder .
 [ horn honks ]
 [ tires screech ]
 Jack ! [ whimpers ]

 - Shut up .
 - I think so .
 Hey , I can do anything if I just believe in myself .

 Ashley , go to sleep .
 Shit .
 Ladies and gentlemen , thank you for joining us today as we introduce you to a brand- new , yet strangely familiar , superstar .
 It 's a fucking sign- up .
 [ sighs ]
 [ Rachel ] So now what ?
 - I guess we just throw her over the gate .

 No , the deal was that we drive you here , and we 've done that .

 - [ Jack ] We 're not driving in there ... - We have brought her this far .
 - No .
 Oh , the gates are open . - Jack , Jack , let 's go , come on .
 - No , no .
 - Come on , let 's go .


 Oh , my God , oh , my God .
 Oh , shit , shit .
 [ both scream ]

 [ Jack ] Well , what now ?
 What 's the next phase of your brilliant plan ?
 [ doorbell rings ]
 - What the hell do I even say ? - [ Ashley Too ]

 [ Jack ] Oh , my God , he 's huge .
 Goggin 's Mouse Service .
 How did you get through the gate ?
 It was open .
 Look , I have an appointment for 11 : 30 to deal with your rodent infestation .
 No , you got the wrong place .
 It was 10030 Bushwick Drive , right ?
 Look , we don 't have a rodent problem .
 The lady of the house said it was super urgent .
 We don 't have another appointment for about three weeks .
 [ exhales ]
 - Make it quick . - OK , thanks .
 Oh , hey , would it be alright if my little sister tagged along ?
 Hi .
 Your sister ?
 Well , well , what do we have here ?
 A kitchen .
 Yes , and mice love kitchens .
 Have you ever seen
 It 's a whole lot more accurate than people would think .
 - Excuse me , sir , may I use the bathroom ? - [ Bear ]
 I 'll take you there .
 You can 't just walk around .
 Actually , I 'm gonna need your help in here , mister .
 Bear , they call me Bear .
 Well , I 'm gonna need your help in here , Mr. Bear .
 - What for ?
 - Observation . Uh , I really need to go .
 - Down the hall , turn left .
 - [ Rachel ] Thank you .
 Excuse me , sir .
 Has this bread box been certified ?
 Certified how ?
 The state requires them to be certified because the crumbs , they attract rodents .
 I 've never heard of that .
 Well , they forgot to tell people .

 [ monitor beeps ]

 - It 's really her .
 -

 Yep , you 're definitely gonna wanna take a look down here .
 There 's , uh ... clear signs of mouse activity .
 [ Bear ] I don 't see anything .
 [ Jack ]
 Mm- hmm .
 [ Ashley Too ]
 [ exhales ]

 [ strains ]
 [ prolonged monitor beep ]
 - What did you do ? -
 [ alert sounds ]
 [ Munk ] The fuck is that ?

 [ Munk ]
 - Yeah ? - [ Munk ]

 OK . I 'll check it out .
 - Wait . - What ?
 - [ electrical crackling ]
 - [ thud ]
 [ Jack whimpers ]
 Dad , please tell me you turned down the voltage .
 [ Rachel cries ]
 You killed her .


 [ Jack ] What happened ?
 She killed her .


 You were never gonna look for evidence , were you ?
 You just come in here and you pull the plug .

 No , no , we wouldn 't have .
 Rachel . - We gotta go . - I 'm so sorry .
 [ gasps ]
 Oh , shit .
 - [ whirring ]
 - [ Jack ]
 Holy fuck .
 [ Ashley O grunts ]
 - [ Rachel ] Ashley .
 - [ grunts ]
 Oh , my gosh .
 I 'm such a huge fan .
 [ Munk ] Bear ?
 [ Jack ] Oh , my God . There 's someone coming .
 Come on !
 Bear ?
 Bear ?
 [ shivers ]
 [ unsteady breathing ]
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 [ Catherine ] And then it 's " It isn 't a dream , it 's reality , but enough from me , " yadda , yadda , yadda , then it 's ...

 And then it 's showtime .
 [ phone rings ]
 Munk .
 [ whispers ] I got it . Why are you interrupting me ?
 - [ unsteady breathing ] - [ Munk ] She 's up .
 - Who 's up ? - [ Munk ]

 [ Catherine ]
 [ Munk ] Looks like the dream box had a power outage .
 The good news is the restraint system works . No .
 We need her alive , at least until they sign the papers .
 Put her back under .
 Of course .
 [ sobs ]
 Please , I 'm begging you , please don 't do this to me , please .
 [ grunts ]
 - Fuck !
 [ sobs ] - [ Munk ]
 Shhh .
 - Please , no , no .
 - It 's OK .
 Please .
 [ whimpers ]
 Leave her alone .
 [ shouts ]
 Leave her alone .
 [ groans ]
 [ Munk grunts ]
 [ groans ]
 [ sobs ] Help me .
 [ Ashley O ]
 Get these things off me .
 It 's not opening .
 [ Rachel ] It 's too strong .
 Stop moving .

 - What ?
 - [ Ashley O whimpers ]
 - [ whirring ]
 - [ pants ] [ Jack ] OK , come on .
 [ Rachel ] Come on , come on . Here we go .
 Who are you guys ?
 I 'm Rachel and like I said , I 'm a huge fan .
 [ Ashley Too ]
 Why is that thing talking like that ?
 All real ?

 I can 't believe there 's two of you .
 That thing isn 't all of me .
 I 'm all of me .


 - - You have to shut up .

 Aunt Catherine , oh , my God , we have to stop her .

 [ indistinct chatter ]

 Are you ready ?
 [ announcer ]
 - - [ applause ]

 - - Hi . - - [ applause ]
 Ladies and gentlemen , welcome and thank you for joining us as we introduce you to a brand- new , yet strangely familiar , superstar .
 - Come on , to the car .
 - Uh- uh .
 - What ? No , no , no , come on . - Uh- uh .
 You 'll be fine . Come on , let 's go .
 Get in .
 Come on .
 [ tires screech ]
 Fuck .
 I don 't need to tell you that in an age of streaming content ,
 live tours are now by far the most lucrative aspect of the music industry .
 But for the past six months , Ashley , of course , has been sadly unable to participate ... until today .
 Ladies and gentlemen , we are proud to introduce you to Ashley Eternal .
 [ audience cheers ]
 - Isn 't she great ?
 - [ intermittent whooping ]
 Ashley Eternal is the most accurate and versatile holographic performer in history .
 Photo- realistic and fully controllable , right down to instant costume changes .
 [ murmuring ]
 [ all gasp ]
 - Oh , my God . - Jack , do you know the way to the stadium ?
 - No . - I do .
 They do .
 Wait , that 's not all .
 Ashley is also fully scalable .
 And when I say , " scalable , " I mean
 [ audience exclaims ]
 [ Catherine ] No more squinting from half a mile away .
 Now the entire audience gets a front row seat , no matter how big the venue .
 Finally , an act that will make the live audience put down their damn phones ,
 look up , and gasp in awe .
 - You have to jump the light . - I 'm not jumping a red .
 - Go . - No . OK .
 [ horn honks ]
 I 'm so sorry , I 'm sorry .
 [ siren sounds ]
 - Shit , it 's the cops .
 - I 'm never gonna get my license .
 And there 's more .
 Ashley Eternal is streamable .
 She can appear in thousands of locations simultaneously .
 Imagine an entire nationwide tour , all taking place on the same night .
 Never exhausted , never sick , always pitch perfect , bringing her A- game .
 It 's not a dream , it 's reality .
 But that 's enough from me .
 Let 's give it up for Ashley Eternal .
 [ cheering ]

 - - Give it up .
 -
 - [ siren wails ]
 - Right up there , see . - Well , how do I get in ?
 - [ both Ashleys ] There 's a door round back .
 - OK , one at a time , please .
 I 've played this place a million times . -
 - What 'd you think about the acoustics ?
 - - Right ?
 - Guys , do I just drive through ? - Uh- huh .
 This is so cool .
 [ cheering ]
 [ feedback ]
 [ siren wails ]
 Get out of the vehicle , now .
 Come out with your hands up or we open fire !
 [ pants ]
 I don 't wanna die . I don 't wanna die .
 I don 't wanna die . [ policeman ] Get out of the vehicle now .
 [ Catherine ] I don 't wanna die . I don 't wanna die .
 I don 't wanna die . I don 't wanna die .
 I don 't wanna die .
 [ audience murmurs ]
 [ gasps ]
 Oh , fuck it .
 [ rock drum intro plays ] [ audience cheers ]
 [ " Head like a Hole " playing ]
 Alright , everybody , I wrote this next one about my shitty aunt .
