Plus you 've got so much gear
At least pay the church.
- This is a donation - please
We are inexperienced but very enthusiastic
let us help you
you direct our work



All right
You can be responsible for putting these packages
How about dumping it all into a trolley?
Your word is responsible for filling the bucket with water and pouring it in bit by bit while he stirs with the hoe
- Understood - ok
am i ready is there anything i need to do

I think it 's enough for the three of us
Are you kidding me?
It 's not a big project

hello you are here
This is your covert operation
I didn 't say I 'm good at none of these things and we all agree
Oh I know that 's why I 'm here
i want to hire you again
What 's hiring you to be my bodyguard this time?

Conditions are the same as before
I don 't want to make the mistake of last time
you don 't want to make a mistake again
Then don 't mix it up
Just the troublesome thing you 're doing right now
But I 'm already mixed in
I don 't have that. It 's Nacho Barga.



What 's up with him
he broke into my house
Just sit at my house and wait for me to come in
How could he evade my security system?
I still don 't know how to do it
He just needs to unplug your phone line
that 's it
what does he want
Pills okay not
Empty L capsule shell
- L Capsules - That 's right, like nitroglycerin
He 'll pay me a fortune
far more than their price
but
I 'm afraid if I don 't get it or if I get it
I have no idea
tell him you can 't get this
I 've already ordered it. The package will arrive in two days. He knows.
then make up an excuse
Well $3000
- I 'll give you $3000 - I 'm not interested
Find a way yourself
but
do not do














uh, frankly
when you told me about the disciplinary hearing
I must admit I had concerns
So you know I did my due diligence
I read the transcript
read it all
just crazy
everything you did to charles
You and James made him fall into the trap perfectly
you beat him
Oh my God
I still can 't believe this is true
I 'm not crazy I know it 's 1 2 1 6 after Magna Carta
Magna Carta
awesome job
You think this kind of cheating is bad
who would say that
on page 5
There is a breakdown of the loan-to-deposit ratio for each region you can see
If Mesa Verde is not prepared to violate Section 109
increase the number of loans
This must have gone wrong. We 're doing well in Arizona. That 's right, but the FDIC requirements in Utah are different.

Is it really that high?
I thought Arizona was only 79%
Again, Arizona does.
But Utah has a higher loan-to-deposit ratio
I think we 'll check this again
Numbers are a bit outrageous Numbers are okay
If you want to check you can revisit the review guide here

Are you going to check again or can we continue?



Need not
Of course you say 96% then it 's 96%
We 're going to increase the number of loans, of course, can we look at the fixed mortgage rate part again?
Because we absolutely have to keep an eye on it
- Paige, I 'm sorry to do that - that part
very unprofessional
I didn 't mean to talk to you Kim that 's okay
It 's alright it 's alright no I 'm sorry I can 't find any excuse to say that to you



I know how hard you work for these
Please I really forgot about this
you should too
ok




In my opinion everything we do
We just ruined a patient

Fixed Mortgage Rate
I remember it was on the third page
- yes - that 's right
At the top is a comparison of acquisitions if you want to see the big picture









- come on in - ok
go hurry hurry hurry








go in
- let 's go - I 'm trying
It doesn 't sound like the car is in very good condition
please


- I think there is something wrong with your internal combustion engine - no problem
You fail to drive, you don 't even know what you 're talking about
We 're all paid whether we 're there or not.
- maybe we should take the bus - shh please
it will start ok
Yes, there is a real problem with the internal combustion engine.
He ran out of electricity you ran out of electricity can you please stop talking
things you don 't know
- there 's a bus we can do - shhh
give me a minute to think


Listen, let 's take the bus, okay?







Film related staff

I 'm really worried about the younger generation
Mr. McGill, we have a problem
them
hey two are you ready
Our first show is all set. Can I help you with the rehearsal?
we don 't want to do this to you but
- We reconsidered - yes
I know you 're just nervous, it 's stage phobia
tell you we have the inscription card
And because of the great post-editing
we 'll make you look like
James Garner and Mariette Hartley
not like this
only
Seems a bit too expensive for what it will bring and this my friend this is your fault
Because it 's about brand awareness
From now on when people think of guitars
They 'll think 'Abq in harmony'
When they think of piano they think of 'ABQ in tune' drum xylophone than hanging there
Beautiful Rich Blackmore Cheaper
The whole town will think of 'The Harmony ABQ'
Yeah, but what about the playtime?
I mean 'Murder Machine' keeps rerunning - please - please hey grandmothers like to buy
Doyle Lawson 's song as a gift
And it 's school recital season so
Where do the kids go to buy a recorder?
We don 't sell recorders then synthesizers, but the point is
Those checks from Social Security always have a place to spend.
Hey since we 're gonna do it today
I can offer the same set of programs but
50% off
listen
I 'm sorry but we can 't do this
listen i know you wanna do it i know
50% off
Yeah we know but we just don 't
Sure



free
I can shoot for you for free
free
You will advertise for us for free
I 'll shoot a commercial for you guys and I 'll make it air
But when you see how popular it is
And you will surely see it and then we will shoot the others at the normal price
Well now how can you refuse me
- I mean that 's what he said - I don 't think we can say no
the best








You 'll wait until the bus, Mr. McGill
not me
You guys go to the editing room I just need to sit down



Mr. McGill
no i can 't do this
It 's fine
No it 's your own earned it
But you keep losing money
wait and see
will be alright

All right



I 'm finally in a good mood
Drag Alan 's pile of boxes out of the closet
It took me 8 years
I washed all Alan 's clothes one last time
before sending them all to Goodwell.
I cry when I do the laundry I cry when I fold my clothes
crying when taking clothes off
But once these things are done
I think
it 's a good thing
But I left his uniform and I can 't bear to give it away omg he won 't forgive me if I give away the uniform too

But I think it 's okay to keep one thing, right?
I mean
People can reuse other clothes but
I don 't know what they would do with the old uniform
I just can 't remember how much homework I had when Kylie was her age
Seems like it 's nothing to her but
Most of it is just homework to kill time Some of us actually talked to the school board
And they agreed it 's all yours
Let me tell you this coffee is not very good
I guess they sensed if you faced this
- It means being able to face everything - probably
I 'm stronger than I thought
do you mind if i ask
I don 't mean to ask anything but
let me guess
You still have a construction job you need my help with
Do not
But I 'll be the first to call you if I need to
Well you can ask
You said you kept your husband 's uniform
Is it work clothes?
work clothes
you mean police uniform
alan is a navy
retired when he died
I 'm very sorry
The group has heard my story several times.
That 's what we 're here for

Forehead
Alan loves to hike
We even opened an outdoor supply store
I am responsible for online orders in the store
Later
8 years ago
He went to Kira National Forest
never came back they found our car but not him
I have no idea
Did he slip or have a heart attack?
I don 't know if I meet someone who doesn 't look good to him.
Even after all these years, I still don 't know

I wish it wasn 't that important but it does matter




Hello

He took 3 and he was a fool

Yeah he wants everyone to know what a big tycoon he is
I won every dollar he won
We 're here to meet a
celebrities who donate to charities
Kevin Constner, I 'm going upstairs to that corner

what you don 't look like kevin constner
I look exactly like him
People always come and say they like my million-dollar arm
No, there will never be such a thing

This guy is such an asshole go get me a real drink
It 's so hard he needs to calm down
what a cheap drink

we do
We 're going to sell him one for $5000
worthless credit card
you do
Talk to him with your eyes
You just need this to make him think you 're interested in him
I 'll play a good drunk guy and he 'll think I 'm a loser
I 'll try to take you away
he 'll stick to it
Tell him you can 't leave me not yet
Make him feel that you 're going to throw me in a way he 's gonna want to step in
He 'll get you drunk
Then you take my wallet and pick up that card
how to do this

We 're not really going to do that, are we?
Let 's just talk

Yeah, just talking


What 's up

nothing
there must be something wrong
I 've been wondering if there is another way

other way
Chuck, are you talking about him, Kim, he 's cornering us?
- We 've done what we 're supposed to do - but Rebecca

Everything that happened was his fault
everything
Let the past go
he 's not worth it
that 's it


Really? Thanks
Have a good night




how about that
I promise we can use him
Invest in some of Gisele St. Clair 's land in South Africa
yeah definitely 0 , 0 , 0 , personnel , time black screen mining rights are all his









Really
He called me for some obvious reason
Listen, I 'm not here to rob him
He has that thing, right?
tell me your plan
What does it have to do with you
I know it 's all for Salamanca nitro pills
Your boss has a heart problem
You already know why you ask
how do you change

Hector hid the pills in his coat pocket
I 'll change it when he hangs up the coat
After getting him
That 's how he died
Lots of eyes on Salamanca
How are you going to stop them if you do?
find out that you did it

Are you trying to tell me not to do this?
I 'm not trying to tell you anything just want to make sure you know what you 're getting
I 'm not trying to provoke anything, I 'm already involved
I do not have any choice

Hector wants to take advantage of my dad 's business
My dad is a straight guy, he won 't be involved
That means he 's going to the police
then be killed
I won 't let this happen
It 'll be worse if you get caught You think I don 't know who I 'm fighting
I don 't know




What are you doing


than Salamanca
There are a lot of people to worry about
If you insist on doing this
If the pills are successfully replaced without being killed, they will be replaced again.
In exchange why anyone who wants to play the drug abacus won 't succeed
They 'll look at these pills if you do
just replace them

so you want to come with me
Do you have money
good before this

I want you to do one more thing



what
Okay Miss Valco can see you now
second door




hello come in
ok hello i have called several times
about a problem I want to solve
do you have a policy number
Can you look up my name, McGill?


Charles McGill of Hamline McGill Associates
no that 's my brother
Forehead
I 'm Jimmy James McGill Freelance
found it
Looks like you 've already paid for this year
This is where the problem lies
I 'll make a long story short after a series of unfortunate events
My attorney license has been suspended
yes i see it here
Well then I hope I can get a refund while I 'm not a lawyer
It 's fair, right?
I 'm sorry Mr. McGill can 't
We do not refund unused professional negligence insurance
but this is
That 's a lot of money you can get out of thin air.
I understand it looks like this but if one of your customers decides
file a lawsuit against you
you can get insurance
That 's the problem with my customers, they all like me
so they will never sue me
I am quite popular
I can see
But it 's company policy
What about suspension of insurance?
So if someone tried to sue me, of course they wouldn 't
then we
continue to benefit from insurance
I understand your situation is true but there are rules that do not allow us to terminate or start the insurance period
sorry to inform you
next year when your licence is reinstated
due to suspension
How much will your insurance premiums go up?
Forehead
It looks like it 's going up about 150%
gosh


Mr. McGill



I
mr mcgill i 'm sorry
I wish we could help you but we can 't
Feel sorry
