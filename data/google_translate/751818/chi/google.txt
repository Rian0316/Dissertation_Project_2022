You still look worried about Bernard Youstilllookworried , Bernard .
Well yes Well . . . yes .
I mean of course we want to save money I mean, surelywewanttosavemon ey.
Bernard, you know very well Bernard, Youknowperfectlywell The Civil Service must have there hastobesomeway some way to measure success in the Civil Service.
British L eyland measure their success is how much profit by the size of theirprofi ts , or more accurately or , tobemoreaccurate ,
They measure failure by how much they measure their failure reby the size of their loss ses .
But we don 't make a profit and we don 't lose We edon  ' thaveprofitsandlosses .
The number of employees and the size of the budget are measured by the sizeofourstaffan dourbudget. To put it plainly Bernard Bydefinition, Bernard,
A big department is more successful than a small department abigdepartmentismores uccessfulthanasmallon e .
Are you saying that A reyousaying that thenor thwest Regional Controller is doing a fool to save so much money? boobed by savingsomuchm oney ? Of course no one told him to do that Well , ofcourse .

We have to make sure it 's business as usual. We emustjustensurethatit doesn 'tchangeanything.
But they are the people 's representatives Buttheyarethepeople ' srepresentatives, the result of democratic elections democraticallychosen. MPs are not the people 's choice MP  'saren ' tchosenbythepeople,
It 's theirrechosenbytheirl ocalparty determined by their local party. It consists of 35 men in sloppy raincoats35 meningrubbyraincoats

But the cabinet members come from the best of themA ndthegovernmentaresel ectedfromthebestofthem.Bernard,
There are only 630 MPs thereare only 630 MP 's.
A party with more than 300 seats forms the cabinet I foneparty has justover 300 itformsagovernment .
Of these 300 people, 100 are stubborn and old. Ofthat 300, onehundredaretoooldan dtoosilly, and 100 scumbags onehundredtooyoungand toocallow The remaining 100 members of the House of Commons which leaves just about a hundred MP 's
