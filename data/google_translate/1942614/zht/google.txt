Maybe soon I will have one too
The first sentence of the sixth column on the fifth page, why do you have to wear the photo of the hat
- The Bachelor John Watson - What kind of hat is that?
The Bachelor, what are they implying?
Is this a hat? Why does it have brim on both sides?
This is a deerstalker hat
He usually has - Bachelor John Watson - how to use this hat to hunt deer and play with it
It is confirmed that John Watson is a bachelor
- Hunting Frisbee - this is too much
- we 've got to be careful. - there 's still a canopy on it.
hooded brim this is the hooded hat john
what do you mean be careful
I mean it 's not a deerstalker hat anymore it 's a Sherlock Holmes hat
That means you 're no longer a private investigator

Moriarty Crown Stealing Goes to Court 10
It 's you
Heart water Sherlock
You entered the wrong toilet
- I 'm a huge fan of you - obviously
I read your case and have been chasing
will you sign my shirt
There are two types of my fans

Have the skills to catch me before the next murder is the first
- The second one - take a taxi and come to my house

guess what i am
indentation
pocket
ink
- neither - is it?
you are not a fan at all
The indentation on your forearm is from the edge of the table
You should have typed in a hurry. The deadline is under pressure.
that 's it
You have ink marks on your wrists blouse pockets bulge
- It 's a bit revealing. - That stain was on purpose.
You want to see if I 'm as good as others say
ink for newspaper printing
But it 's your finger smeared with your index finger
As a reporter you are less likely to get ink in a newspaper office
You put it there to test me
I 'm starting to like you
I wrote the title for you The Truth Under Sherlock Holmes
Kitty
nice to meet you riley
No, I 'll help you out of this question.
no i do not give interviews
no i don 't need the money
Are you and John Watson just soulmates?
Can I make a note on this issue as well
There are all kinds of gossip about you in the press
Sooner or later you will need someone on your side
Someone who helps you clear up rumors
do you think you can do this kind of work
I 'm smart you can trust me completely
smart, investigative reporter
good look at me say what you see
If you 're talented you don 't need an interview at all you can just read everything you want
Can 't I do it?
I see you looking for your first career scoop to get editor attention
You wore an expensive short skirt and changed the hem twice
This is the only fancy dress you have
You have no money to maintain your nails regularly
I saw a man with a strong desire
What I see is not smart and certainly not reliable
I 'll give you a five-word quote
you make me sick
- Criminal Advisor - Yes
can you explain the testimony in detail
Kims Moriarty is hired
- he 's a businessman - yes
But not the kind of service that helps you fix the heating
Not for helping you load bombs or plotting assassinations.
I 'm guessing he 'd do a good job fixing the boiler though.
Would you describe him as . . .
- Bootstrap - what
You can 't do that, you 're a lead witness
He would object and the judge would support Mr. Holmes
ask me what I think ask me how to describe him
What do I think of him, haven 't they taught you?
Mr. Holmes, without your help, the court will go on like this
How would you describe this person what his personality is like
error one
Kimus Moriarty is not a person at all
he is a spider
The spider in the center of the web There are thousands of threads in this criminal web and he works on each one
know everything
- Then you know . . . - don 't ask that question
- This question sucks - Mr. Holmes
How long have I known him? It 's really not a good question.
Seen twice for a total of five minutes
I pointed a gun at him and he wanted to blow me up
Seems like we 're on the phone
Attorney Sorel, do you really think this guy is an expert?
He and the defendant met for five minutes
I can see through a person in two minutes, five minutes is enough
- Mr. Holmes that 's up to the jury - yeah
merchant
teacher
having an affair
teacher
Married
librarian
A librarian, two teachers, two people with a lot of work pressure, they should be financial people
The jury president is a foreign trained medical secretary - because of her shorthand - Mr. Holmes

Seven married, two are having an affair with each other
They just ran out of afternoon tea. Do you want to know who ate the wafers?
Mr. Holmes
You 're being summoned to answer lawyer Sorel 's question, not to show you how smart you are
Please answer the question concisely
Otherwise you are in contempt of court
Show off for a while, can you die?
What did I say to tell you not to be clever
I don 't mean to turn off the faucet.
- how- what how
Haven 't you been there the whole time?
Like you said, he 's been very calm against the back of his chair.
Moriarty wasn 't going to defend himself at all
Bank of England Tower of London Bentonville Prison
Three of the safest places in the country Moriarty broke into six weeks ago and no one knows how or why
- we only know . . . - he was detained
- don 't - what
- That look- what- you 're showing that look again
I can 't see myself
my face
Yes and you have a 'we all know what 's going on' look
- Exactly - I don 't know that 's why I hate your expression
If Moriarty wanted the crown, he could just take it
He wants to let the prisoners go, they 've already been released, why is he still in prison?
because he wants to be locked up
It 's part of his plan
Cressier lawyer please bring first witness to court
Your Honor, we have no witnesses
I do not understand
Aren 't you the defense?
But my client did not provide any evidence
Defendant 's statement
Jurors Kims Moriarty charged with multiple attempted thefts
He will be jailed for years if convicted, but his legal team
without providing any evidence
It 's unusual to come and defend him, but in fairness I give the jury a verdict
you must convict him
guilty
you must convict him
Court is open
only six minutes
To be honest, it took so long
Too many people queuing for the toilet
Let the jury declare your unanimous verdict
Not guilty, they actually acquit him
Moriarty acquitted without defense
Sherlock
are you listening? he 's out
You know he 's going to find you Xia . . .

People usually knock on the door first
But I don 't think you 're ordinary
the water just opened
Bach will be shocked
- can you sit - please
Did you know that before Bach died he heard his son play his work?
The boy won 't play until it 's over
The dying man jumped out of bed and ran to the piano and played the whole piece
Can 't stand the unfinished movement
You too, that 's why you came here
Honestly, you 're so happy
What is the verdict?
I 'm back to make waves again
Every fairy tale needs an old-school villain
you need me or you ain 't shit
'Cause we 're alike, but you 're more boring than me
you are on the side of justice
Of course you control the jury
What is it that I can break into 12 hotel rooms in the Tower of London
Wired net
Each room has a private TV screen
Everyone has their own weaknesses
If you want your lovely kids to be safe just do as I say have someone you want to protect
a piece of cake
what are you going to do
ruin me
This is the last puzzle of this puzzle
do you think what is it?
what is the last case
I told you but did you listen carefully
How hard is it for you to say 'I don 't know'
- I don 't know - very smart, very smart
Speaking of being smart, have you told your little ones?
Say what
- Why did I break into those places and come back empty-handed- no
- but you understand - of course
Say it then
You yourself know what I 'm talking about
no i want you to prove you know
- take nothing because you don 't need - ok
you don 't have to take anything anymore
good for what
Because there 's nothing in the Tower of England and Bentonville prison quite like the key in your hand that lets you break into them
I can open any door anywhere with just a few lines of computer code
Any private bank account is bullshit, it 's all mine
There 's no more secrets, I 've got the secrets
nuclear weapon code
I can blow up NATO at will
The world is locked up in a room where the key is the king
Darling, you should see me wearing the crown
You are using interrogation to publicize yourself and show the world your ability
you helped me too
Clients can be more Liberal government intelligence organization terrorist organization
they all want me
In a blink of an eye, I 've become a millionaire
If you can get into any bank what do you care about the highest bidder
I don 't care, I just love watching them steal their heads
'Dad loves me the most' Mortal is so cute
You have John anyway
I should find a live-in boyfriend too.
- why are you doing this - sure fun
you don 't really want money or power
for what
I want to solve that problem
our problem
final puzzle
It 's about to start Sherlock 's fall
But don 't be afraid that falling is the same as flying, but the end is only death
i don 't like riddles
learn to like
Because I owe you a fall Sherlock
I owe you
Moriarty acquitted in stunning verdict in Central Court

Diogenes Club
Excuse me, I 'm looking for Mycroft Holmes
ask if he is there
can 't you hear me
ok does anyone know
Who knows . . . where Mycroft Holmes was told me to wait for him here
no one cares about me
Am I transparent can you see me
Thank you two people for calling me to Mycroft Holmes
what a plane
Tradition Well John Tradition defines us
What kind of tradition is it not allowed to speak?
Can 't even say 'pass me the candy'?
Most of the foreign affairs department and half of the government and parliament have tea together. This is good for everyone. Believe me
We don 't want a repeat of 1972
bloody sunday event
- But here you can talk - look at this
very interesting
They 're going to break the news on Saturday
I 'm curious where she got this information from
Do you know a guy named Brooke?
Maybe alumni
sherlock alumni
But that 's not why I called you here
- who is this - don 't you know?
- Don 't know - Haven 't seen him
He was just two homes away from you when he moved to Baker Street.
I was about to visit my neighbor
I think it 's okay
Soleimani Albanian professional killer
Live within 20 feet of your home
The location is very good, it 's very convenient to take the subway
- John - what does this have to do with me
Dechenko Ludmilla

- I think I 've seen her - Russian killer
live opposite your house
All right
I kinda see what you mean
In fact, the four top international assassins all moved to the vicinity of 2 2 1 B
Is there anything you want to tell me? Should I move?

It 's not hard to guess what they have in common
Do you think Moriarty arranged it?
He told Sherlock that he would definitely come back
If this was Moriarty 's masterpiece, we 'd be dead
If it wasn 't Moriarty, who was it?
Why don 't you talk to Sherlock if you 're so worried?
God stop talking
There 's so much between us John
old account resentment
stole his smurf or broke his mobile suit
finish watching
We all know what 's going to happen John
Moriarty won 't give up, he vows to kill his only rival
So you asked me to babysit your brother because he won 't accept your help
Hope it won 't bother you too much
- borrowed - sorry
Sherlock is having a strange thing . . .
what happened
- Kidnapping - Ambassador Rufus Bloor
isn 't he in Washington
not him but his child
Max and Claudette are seven and nine years old
- Their luxury boarding school in St Airdez-Surrey
School holiday, other boarders go home
Only a few children stay at school, including them
Two children are missing, the ambassador personally named you
Hero of Reichenbach

It 's nice to work on a case with a celebrity.
should be able to let you go soon thanks

- It 's all right. - Miss Mackenzie is the housekeeper. Be gentle.
Miss Mackenzie, you are in charge of student safety, but someone broke in easily last night.
Are you an idiot drunk or an accomplice quickly answer me right away

Doors and windows are closed
No one including me was in their room last night
you gotta believe me
I believe I just wanted you to hurry up
Miss Mackenzie needs a pocket to breathe
Six thousand yuan per semester is still not enough to guarantee the safety of children
You said the other kids have gone on vacation
Only the two of them still live on this floor
No sign of forced entry at all
The intruder must be hiding somewhere
Grimm 's Fairy Tales
take me to my brother 's room
The little boy sleeps here every night
Staring at the only light coming in from the hallway
He will recognize the shape and silhouette of every person who walks up to the door
so what
That way if someone he hasn 't seen walks up to the door and knows it 's an intruder, maybe he can see the outline of the weapon
what would he do
What would he have done if he hadn 't screamed for help in those precious seconds before they broke in
This little boy is this little boy he read so many spy novels what would he do
leave any mark
call anderson
help us flax oil
It 's useless, can 't help us find the kidnappers
very good Anderson
- yeah- yeah, that 's a good idiot look
look at the floor
He left a footprint for us
Why is the boy forced to walk in front of them because of tiptoe?
uneasy performance
Someone pointed a gun to his head
The girl was pulled and walked sideways beside him
his arms around her neck
That 's it, we don 't know where they 're going next
still useless
It 's useless for Anderson.
Just let us know his shoe size, height, footwork and pace
Did you have fun
happy now
Maybe it 's better not to laugh, after all, there are children who are tied up
How did he dodge the monitors if the doors were locked?
He came in when the door was unlocked
But how can that kind of school let strangers come and go at will
Anyone can go in and out of any place as long as the time is right. Yesterday was the end of the period.
Parents, drivers, staff everywhere
If there is a stranger among them, who will notice
he waits
Just find a good place to hide
St Bartholomew 's Hospital
Jasmine
hello i 'm going out
- No you 're not going out - I have a lunch date
- Cancel, let 's have lunch together- what
I need your help
It 's about one of your ex-boyfriends and we 're tracking him down
He 's been a little bit tricky lately
- Did Moriarty do it? - Of course he
Actually Kim isn 't really my boyfriend. We 've only dated three times. I haven 't dated him anymore.

Yeah and then he went and stole the crown and the scepter and broke into the Bank of England
Also organized an escape from Bentonville Prison to maintain law and order I suggest you
Don 't find a boyfriend in the future, Jasmine
Those greasy stains in John 's kidnapper 's footprints
will help us find Moriarty
All the chemicals on his shoes are preserved
The sole is like a passport
If we 're lucky we can track down all his recent whereabouts
that needs analysis
is sexual
- thank you john - it 's jasmine
Yes
chalk
asphalt
brick dust
plant
I owe you
Glycerol molecule
Glycerol Glycerol Propane 1 , 2 , 3 Triol 3 Hydroxy Functional Group
What is it
What do you mean when you say 'I owe you'
You just said 'I owe you'
You 've been chanting these words just now
nothing to remember
You 're a bit like my dad, he 's dead oh no sorry
Jasmine, please don 't feel compelled to strike up a conversation with me, it 's really not your forte
He was always happy in the days before he died, but not when he thought no one saw him
- I was sad to see him once- Jasmine
You 're sad when you think he can 't see you
are you okay don 't say you are okay
Because I know what that expression means
I thought it was sad when no one looked at you
- You can see me - I don 't count against you
I just wanted to say that if I can do anything you need me to do I 'll help you
It 's not me I mean I mean anything I can do if you need me
But what will I need you to do
nothing i don 't know
Actually you can just say thank you
then thank you
I 'm going to buy some chips to eat
what do you want to eat
Forget it, I know you don 't eat
- In fact, or I . . . - I know you don 't eat

Sherlock
That envelope in the box - and another - what

Someone put it on our doorstep today, you see
lo and behold, the exact same seal
- Breadcrumbs - I 'll put them there when I get back
traces of breadcrumbs
The hardcover fairy tale book
Grimm 's Fairy Tales
Two children were led into the woods by their evil father and they followed the crumbs to the candy store
It 's the story of 'Candy House'
What kind of kidnapper left a clue
The kidnapper who likes to brag, he sees it all as a game
The exact words he told me while sitting in our apartment were
Every fairy tale needs an old-school villain
The fifth substance is part of a fairy tale
- The witch 's house - what
Glycerol molecule
Polyglycerol ricinoleate
is polyglycerol ricinoleate
- what is that - it 's for making chocolate
This was faxed an hour ago
Come on, they 're dying, what did you find out?
We 're going to find a place in town where these five things intersect
chalky asphalt brick dust plant
what chocolate is this I think we 're looking for an abandoned candy factory
We need to narrow down the candy factory with asphalt.
No, it 's too general to be more specific.
chalky chalky clay so narrow the geographic area
brick dust
Fifties bricks at building site
There are thousands of construction sites in London
- I sent someone out to find it - I have it too
The homeless information network is much more agile than the police and doesn 't mind taking bribes
John
Rhododendron Pentu meets the requirements
Chalk Brick Dust Plant Chocolate Adeston
- Addston - what
Abandoned factory building a mile from the river and park meets all the requirements


Okay, go over there
Do not miss
Everyone please spread out

They just went out and they 're still here
candy paper
What did he feed you Hansel and Gretel

- mercury - what
Mercury smeared on candy paper is poisonous
the more they eat
will kill them
But one is not enough to kill
If ingested in sufficient amounts it will eventually kill them
He doesn 't need to come to the execution himself
Remote control kills he can stay thousands of miles away
The more hungry they eat, the sooner they die. It 's beautiful.

- Take control - over here
I 'll take care of him don 't worry
Okay, all the professionals have asked.
If you want to go in, ask yourself
Remember she was frightened and only seven so if you could . . .
- Don 't be too Sherlocky. - Yes, it might be better.
Claudette I
Don 't do this, I know you 're scared
- Claudette listens - go out


- It doesn 't make sense. - The child is overly frightened.
Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper somewhere
did she say anything
didn 't say a word
- Where 's the boy - still in a coma
still in intensive care
don 't take it to heart
I want to scream every time I see you coming in
To be honest, many people feel the same
let 's go
You 've found those kids just by footprints
It 's amazing thank you
incredible

- how are you - thinking
I 'll take this car, wait for the next one
- why- you can talk
'Is this chocolate' 'We 're looking for an abandoned candy factory'
' go out '

Is there a problem

Hello
Are you ready to hear the story?
This is the story of the boastful knight
A footprint that 's all his clues
a footprint
Yeah, you know what he 's capable of
Baker Street Crime Scene Investigation Specialist
But our people can 't do it
so we need him he is better
This is just an explanation
Is there any other explanation?
The proud knight is the bravest and wisest of the knights of the round table
But the other knights were getting tired of his stories about how heroic he was in extolling his dragon-slaying feats
Soon they began to wonder if the boastful jazz story was true.
Only he can find the evidence
no no
The girl screamed heartbreakingly when she saw him she 'd never seen him unless she 'd seen him before
what are you trying to say
You know what I 'm trying to say you just don 't want to believe it
So all the knights went and said to King Arthur
'I don 't believe in the story of the boastful knight'
'He 's a big liar' 'It 's all the stories he makes up that make him look amazing'
You don 't really think he did it, do you?
I think we have to consider the possibility
Later even the king became suspicious
But the ultimate problem with the boastful knight is not this
Do not
It 's not his final question
the story is over
parking
parking
That is how the matter
what is that
no money
careful
thanks
Sherlock
it 's him
Mycroft, Soleimani or something, showed me his file
He 's an Albanian gangster who lives only two houses away from us.
- He was killed for shaking my hand - what does that mean?
He saved my life but can 't touch me why
There are four killers living in front of our house
They didn 't come to kill me
They must save my life
I have what they all want
but if any of them approach me
others will kill him
Select the network you want to use Select the network you want to use from the list below Enter the network password if necessary All attention is on me

What is so important to you?
I have to ask about the dust removal status
Want precise details where was swept last week
I cleaned your carpet on tuesday
not here we 're looking for this room
Any traces of dust being wiped away can return anything but dust will not
Dust is hard evidence
what is he doing
Find the cameras, we 're being watched
what camera is here?
I 'm wearing pajamas
- No detective - what 's wrong

- my answer is no- I didn 't ask anything.
you want to take me to the police station
Don 't bother you to ask
Sherlock
- Because of that scream - yeah
who said donovan must be donovan
Am I implicated in kidnapping
Moriarty is smart
He planted the seeds of doubt in her mind
That feeling lingers
hard to resist
You can 't kill an idea, can you?
as long as it takes root here
will you come with me
His next move is a picture
Moriarty 's Game
First the screams of the child and then the picture of me being taken for questioning
He wants to destroy me bit by bit
It 's a game Lestrade and I don 't wanna play
Say hello to Sergeant Donovan for me
- they will decide - what decision
Are you coming back with a warrant to arrest me?
do you think so
This is standard procedure
You should go with him others will think . . .
I don 't care what other people think
But you don 't want them to think you 're stupid or made a mistake
It 's not that they are stupid, they made a mistake
Sherlock, I don 't want the world to think you 're . . .
what i thought
fraud
- you 're right to worry about them - what
- You 're worried they 're right about me - no
That 's why you 're irritable
You can 't help but think they might be right
- you 're afraid you 've been deceived - I didn 't
Moriarty is playing with your mind too
Can 't you see what 's going on?
No I know the real you
one hundred percent
Who would keep pretending to be such a nuisance
- Sherlock Holmes - yes sir
the guy who 's been in the media

I thought he was a private detective
- he is - we 've been consulting him all the time do you mean
We didn 't let him get involved in a confidential case, did we?
There are one or two
Maybe twenty or thirty
what
I 'm not the only one doing this Gregson . . .
To shut up

An amateur detective has access to all kinds of classified information
Now he 's still a suspect in a case
- With all due respect - you idiot Lestrade
go get him now
go catch him
now you 're happy
What if it wasn 't just this case?
What if he was playing with us every time?
There 's still someone in the police station guarding us, it 's Lestrade.
He said they were coming
All the police officers you 've embarrassed
They 're all lining up to torture you. That 's a lot of people.

sorry for bothering you
Someone sent a package I forgot to mark it as perishable
I had to sign
The name is funny, it 's German, like a fairy tale
burnt
What does it mean
- Police - I 'll open the door
Sherlock
- Sorry Mrs Hudson - we need to talk
Don 't just break in like that
Do you have an arrest warrant?
stay out of john

be polite
Sherlock Holmes I am now arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping
- It 's okay John - he didn 't resist
No how could it be okay this is ridiculous
Now take him downstairs
you really shouldn 't
Don 't get in the way of business or I 'll arrest you with me
Are you satisfied
I already said
- When we first met - Forget it
He will not be satisfied with solving cases
One day he will cross the line
Think for yourself who would kidnap kids just to show off by getting them back
- Donovan - sir
- Has anyone caught it - yes sir
It 's weird to look at him if I say
This vigilante is usually like this
what are you looking at
how are you sir
- come with me - yes
Apparently punching the Chief Superintendent is illegal.

that 's not very smart
No one 's coming to bail us now
I prefer to run away boldly now
- All units to zone 2 7 - what
All units to 2

Ladies and gentlemen, would you please get down?
- better get down now - do as he says
Remind you guys that he took the gun, I 'm the one you know
my hostage
The hostage is right, this can have
This can have
What should we do now
Run as a fugitive as Moriarty wishes
catch him Lestrade
hold my hand
I 'm sure I 'm going to be gossiped now.
- the gun dropped - leave it alone
Sherlock and more
We have to coordinate
go to the right go to your right
Everyone prefers to have it and that 's the genius of it
A lie that is more popular than the truth
My deduction is deceiving
Everyone is comfortable Sherlock is nothing special
Mycroft he can help us
Now is not a good time to play family cards
Sherlock
I knew I couldn 't escape the police if someone came
That man isn 't a cop, it 's our new neighbor on Baker Street
Let 's see if he can give us the answer
where are we going
We 're going to rush to the front of that bus


what do you want from me
tell me
he 's in your apartment
- who - Moriarty
what did you put
- program code - that 's it
he sells it publicly
Procedure for breaking into the Tower of London
He moved his hands and feet when he came
it can turn things around
It 's the key to break any system right now in our apartment
So he left that message telling everyone where to 'find Sherlock'
we have to go back to the apartment to find it
The Criminal Investigation Bureau is there
why frame it for you
Another crooked idea that ruined my reputation and now I 'm the biggest suspect in those crimes
have you seen this
Large explosion
Sherlock 's Shocking Truth Close Friend Richard Brooker Completely Confesss a Guy Named Richard Brooker
who is this person
Is it too late to make a statement
Congrats on 'The Truth About Sherlock Holmes'
Exclusivity everyone wants and you got it pretty
I gave you a chance
I wanted to be on your side, remember?
you rejected me so . . .
Then there was a big surprise and someone broke the news
It really came true. Who is Brooke?

Tell me, Kitty is the devil to believe the phone call.
No doubt meeting in the cafe, meeting in the hotel room, talking to the interviewer
How could you believe him
A guy who came out with a chalice
How did he convince you
Honey, I can 't buy ground coffee, so I bought the regular one
You said they couldn 't find it here You said I was safe here
you are safe
Richard, I 'm a witness, they won 't hurt you in front of a witness
This is your whistleblower
Moriarty is Richard Brook
He 's Richard Brook, Moriarty doesn 't exist
never this person
- what nonsense are you talking about - take a closer look at him

who Richard Brooks Sherlock hired to play Moriarty
Dr. Watson, I know you 're a good man. Don 't hurt me.
No you 're Moriarty, he 's Moriarty
we met remember you wanna blow me up

sorry Sorry
He paid me to hire me and I need work
I 'm an actor and I 'm unemployed
Sherlock, you better explain what I don 't understand at all.
let me explain it in black and white
It 's all solid evidence here
Sherlock is a liar, he planned all the crimes
You made up what Kims Moriarty called an old enemy.
In fact, all the crimes were planned by him
The most powerful is to create a crime master out of thin air
- This is bullshit. - ask him
He 's here to ask him
- tell him Richard - come on, he was in court
That 's right, you paid him to take the blame
Guaranteed to get a jury
Not a West End character but I guess it 's a lot of money
But not enough or he won 't break the news
I 'm sorry sincerely sorry
That 's the story you 're going to publish
The final conclusion is that Moriarty is just an actor
Behind the scenes
I have evidence and evidence to show them . . .
Kitty show them
Okay, take it out and I 'll take a look
I 've been on TV, it 's a kids channel
I tell stories
Richard Brooke
Award-winning actor in popular medical drama
I tell stories on DVD
Richard Brook CV
tell him
Anyway, that 's it, don 't hide it
Tell them what to say and say and hide

don 't touch me you don 't want to touch me
have you had enough
don 't hurt me don 't let him come
let him go

No, no, he has backup
Did you know Sherlock Holmes
I can see through you now, you make me sick
can he really do it
Completely change your identity to smear you as a criminal
He has complete control over my situation
To sell a big lie and wrap it in the truth to look impeccable
It 's just your family
He spent a day planting seeds of doubt in people 's heads
One more thing to end this game is...
Sherlock
I 'm going to do something
- can i help with anything - no i have to do it alone

You said it wrong before, you know?
you do count
You always count, I always believe in you
But you 're also right
I do have something
What 's wrong with you
jasmine i may be dying
what do you need
If I 'm not what you think I am
Not even what I think it is
would you still help me
what do you need
you
She really did a lot of homework, Miss Riley. Only those closest to Sherlock know this.

Have you looked at your brother 's address book recently?
There are only two names you and I and Moriarty didn 't get it from me
- John - what 's the matter, what 's your relationship?
Do you guys go out for coffee once in a while with Kim
Your own brother, you told this madman the story of his life
I didn 't plan to . . . I didn 't even think about it. . .
You just wanted to tell me about this
'Take care of him because I made a mistake'
how did you know him
We know people like him, we 're in control
But Kims Moriarty has an unprecedented criminal mind and the ultimate weapon
code
Just a few lines of program can be unblocked
You kidnapped him just to get the code
We interrogated him for weeks
- What happened? - He didn 't cooperate.
He just sat and stared into the dark
The only thing that can get him to speak is . . .
I can let him talk just a little bit
But. . .
In return you revealed Sherlock 's story to him
So this big lie Sherlock is a liar and people will believe it because the rest is true
Moriarty tried to destroy Sherlock and you gave him the most powerful weapon
John
I 'm very sorry
forget it
tell him
i got your text message
Program code is the crux of the problem Find it out and use it
Beat him the Moriarty way
what do you mean by using
He used to make up a fake identity, we can also tamper with records and destroy Richard Brook.
Push Kim Moriarty back
The day he was acquitted he hid the code somewhere in 2 2 1 B

- what has he touched - an apple and that 's it
- did he write anything - no

h Come and play h  h  h Xia Fu on the roof of Butts Hospital
By the way hhhhhhhhhh brought something you might want back

it 's me
what
What 's the matter, is she alright?

No, okay, I 'll be right here
- what 's the matter - are paramedics
Mrs Hudson was shot
what happened
Maybe it 's those killer gods you brought in
She can 't, Sherlock, let 's go
you go i 'm busy

- busy- thinking I need to think
Do you need . . . you don 't care about her at all?
The last time someone touched her, you almost killed him
- she 's my landlord - she 's dying
you are so cold blooded
damn you just stay here as you like
I only have loneliness for company loneliness can protect me
It 's friends who don 't protect us
hhh I 'm waiting for you Oh Kim Mo






All right
finally meet
Just the two of us Sherlock
Our Questions Ultimate Questions
alive
boring
immutable
I 've been looking for fun my whole life You used to be so fun now it 's not fun because I beat you
do you know
It 's too simple after all
boring
I can only go back and play with ordinary people and in the end you are just an ordinary person like them
All right
Are you starting to wonder if I 'm real
Did you play me too?
Richard Brooke
No one sees the bright spot in it but you do
- of course - that 's good
Richard Brook 's German is Reichenbach
- The case that made me famous- just thought it was funny
Good, you can see it
rhythm of numbers
Every beat is 1 and the rest are 0
binary code
So those killers are going to save me
The code is hidden in my body and in my mind
Hack any system with just a few lines of code
I say to those clients that the last one is a coward
But now I know that I can use this modification record
I can kill Richard Brook and get Kim Moriarty back
no no no this is too simple
too easy
No code idiots at all
Those numbers don 't make any sense, they don 't make any sense
Don 't you really think you can hack the world 's systems with just a few lines of code?
I 'm so disappointed, ordinary man Sherlock
- But that rhythm - is Bach 's Concerto No. 1 Thank you
- So how did you . . . - hack into the bank
Is there a prison in the Tower of London?
Broad daylight robbery only requires accomplices
The fun begins
I know you 'll take the bait and that 's your weakness
you always think things smart
Can our game be over? The last scene
Luckily you picked a tall building and that worked well
what to do
yeah of course
suicide
The genius detective is a liar
I read in the newspaper it must be true
my favorite newspaper
And fairy tales
I especially like dark fairy tales
God, John, you scared me to death. Are the cops alright?
Sherlock is done.
Oh my God
taxi
Taxi, wait, I 'm a policeman, right?
thanks man thank you so much
I can prove that you faked that fake identity
Just kill yourself
jump
for me
Are you alright?
you are crazy
did you just know
All right
I 'll give you some more motivation
if you don 't dance your friend will die
- John - not just John but
- Mrs Hudson - and
- Lestrade - Three bullets, three killers, three dead
No one can stop them unless they see you jumping off the building
Arrest me, torture me, do whatever you want with me, but nothing can stop them from pulling the trigger
Your only three friends in this world are dead
- Unless- I kill myself and make your story
You have to admit it 's more appealing
- I died infamously - of course that 's the point

You have an audience now
please
dance
I told you the end of the story
Only you dead killer will stop
I definitely wouldn 't do it
can you give me some time
leave me alone
please
of course can
what
why are you laughing
what do you know
you won 't do it
So there is still a way to make the killer stop with a code code or a number
If I had you I wouldn 't have to die

Do you think you can get me to order them to stop?
- Do you think you can do it - Of course


- You think so too - Sherlock, your brother and the whole government can 't force me to do things I don 't want to do.
yes but i 'm not my brother remember
I am you
ready to do anything
ready to destroy everything
Get ready to do what ordinary people can 't
do you want to meet me in hell
Then I will accompany
Do not
you talk too much
Not at all
you are ordinary
You are an ordinary person and you are on the side of justice
I may be on the side of justice but that doesn 't mean I 'm the same as them
not to you
I understand
you are not ordinary
no
you are me
you are me
Thanks Sherlock Holmes
Thank you
God bless you
As long as I 'm alive you can save your friends and you 'll have a way out
good luck then
Do not

yes sir thanks bye
Hey
- John - Sherlock, are you all right?
Turn around and walk back I 'm here
do as i say
I beg you
where
stop there
- Sherlock - Alright look up I 'm on the roof
gosh
I can 't come down so that 's all we can talk about
What 's up
i want to apologize
it 's all true
what
Everything they said about me I created Moriarty
why do you say that
I 'm a fake
- Sherlock - everything in the papers is true
I want you to tell Lestrade
tell mrs hudson and jasmine
Tell everyone who believes in you that I made Moriarty for myself
Okay shut up Sherlock
When we first met - you knew everything about my sister - no one could be so smart

you can
i investigated you
I checked everything about you before we met just to impress you
It 's just a trick
don 't say it

don 't stand there don 't move
- don 't move - okay
look at me
- please can you do this for me - what

This call is my last word
People do it
leave a last word
What the hell did you leave behind?
- goodbye john - no no no
Sherlock
Sherlock
Sherlock
I 'm a doctor, let me go, let me go
He is my friend, my friend, please
please let me . . .
Oh, God
Do not
it 's not true
Fake genius commits suicide
What did you want to say - but didn 't say - uh

Say it now
Sorry, I can not do it
all those things those scientific instruments
I have it all in a box and don 't know what to do
I think it 's better to donate to the school.
do you want. . .
I can 't go back right now, I need to slow down
i 'm so angry
it 's okay john it 's nothing weird
He makes everyone angry
sherlock holmes
Look at the marks he left on my desk and the noise
- Shooting at 1:30 a.m. - yeah
And put the damn specimen in my freezer
- how can you put corpses where you eat - yeah
Fighting and messing up the walls
Listen, I 'm actually not that angry, okay?
ok i 'll leave you alone

you once told me
You 're not a hero I once thought you weren 't human but I 'm going to tell you that you are . . .
I know . . .
The best . . . the most human
No one can make me believe that everything you say to me is lying to me
that 's it
I 'm so lonely I owe you a lot
But please, please, one more thing, one thing, one miracle, Sherlock, for me, please don 't . . . don 't die
Can it be just for me
don 't do this to me
