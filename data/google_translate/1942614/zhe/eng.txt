 Why today ?
 Do you want to hear me say it ?
 18 months since our last appointment .
 You read the papers ?
 Sometimes ...
 And you watch telly ?
 You know why I 'm here .
 I 'm here because ...
 What happened , John ?
 Sherl ...
 You need to get it out .
 Sherlock Holmes ... .. is dead . My best friend ...


 Sherlock 2x03 " The Reichenbach Fall " Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd Falls Of The Reichenbach .
 Turner 's masterpiece .
 Thankfully recovered , owing to the prodigious talent of Mr Sherlock Holmes .

 A small token of our gratitude .
 Diamond cufflinks ...
 All my cuffs have buttons .
 He means thank you .
 Do I ?
 Just say it .
 Thank you .
 Hang on .


 Back together with my family , after my terrifying ordeal .
 And we have one person to thank for my deliverance ...
 Sherlock Holmes .
 Tie pin .
 I don 't wear ties .
 Shhh .


 Peter Ricoletti ...
 Number one on Interpol 's most wanted list since 1982 .
 We got him , and there 's one person we have to thank for giving us the decisive leads .
 With all his customary diplomacy and tact .
 Sarcasm .
 Yes .
 We all chipped in .
 Oh ...
 Put the hat on .
 Put the hat on .
 Yes , Sherlock , put it on .
 Just get it over with .
 " Boffin ! "
 " Boffin Sherlock Holmes ! "
 Everybody gets one .
 One what ?
 Tabloid nickname .
 SuBo , Nasty Nick . I 'll probably get one soon .
 Page five , column six , first sentence .
 Why is it always the hat photograph ? !
 " Bachelor John Watson . " What kind of hat is it ?
 What are they implying ? !
 Is it a cap ?
 Why has it got two fronts ?
 It 's a deerstalker .
 " Frequently seen in the company of bachelor John Watson . " What are you going to do , throw it ?

 " Confirmed bachelor John Watson . "
 A death frisbee !
 This is too much , we need to be more careful .
 It 's got flaps .
 Ear flaps , it 's an ear hat , John .
 What do you mean , more careful ?
 I mean , this isn 't a deerstalker now , it 's a Sherlock Holmes hat .
 I mean , you 're not exactly a private detective any more .
 You 're this far from famous .
 Oh , it 'll pass .
 It better pass .
 The press will turn , Sherlock , they always turn and they 'll turn on you .
 It really bothers you . What ?
 What people say .
 Yes .
 About me ? why would it upset YOU ?
 Just try to keep a low profile .
 Find yourself a little case this week .
 Stay out of the news .


 That 's your phone .
 Hmm , it keeps doing that .
 So , did you just talk to him for a really long time ?
 Oh , Henry Fishguard never committed suicide .
 Bow Street runners missed everything .
 Pressing case , is it ?
 They 're all pressing until they 're solved .
 Put your key back please . Thank you .

 Excuse me , sir .
 Any metal objects , keys , mobile phones ?
 You can go through .
 Thank you .
 Fancy a cuppa then , mate ?
 Yeah , why not ?
 Gilts at seven .
 Dutch Telecoms in free- fall .
 Thank you , Harvey .

 What are you saying ?
 Refuse them all parole and bring back the rope ?
 Let 's begin .
 This is an emergency .
 Please leave .
 Sir , I 'm going to have to ask you to leave .
 Sir , there 's been a break- in .
 Not our division .
 You 'll want it .
 The vault !

 Hacked into the Tower of bloody London 's security ? !
 How ? !
 Tell them we 're on our way ! There 's been another one , another break- in .
 Bank of England !
 Sir !
 Security 's down , sir .
 It 's failing .
 What is it now ?
 Pentonville Prison .
 Oh no !
 No rush .
 I 'll get it , shall I ?
 Here .
 Not now , I 'm busy .
 Sherlock ...
 Not now ! He 's back .

 That glass is tougher than anything .
 Not tougher than crystallised carbon .
 He used a diamond .





 # Oh , sinnerman , where you gonna run to ?
 # Sinnerman , where you gonna run to ?
 # Where you gonna run to ?
 # All on that day
 # Well , I run to the rock ... #
 Ready ? Yes .

 Stand back .
 Stand back .
 Mr Holmes . Mr Holmes .
 Let them through .
 Thank you .
 Get in .
 # Oh , Lord ... # Please help me , Lord
 # Don 't you see me praying
 # Don 't you see me down here praying
 # But the Lord said
 # Go to the devil The Lord said
 # Go to the devil
 # He said Go to the devil
 # All on that day
 # So I ran to the devil
 # He was waiting ... #
 Remember ... Yes .
 Remember ... Yes .
 Remember what they told you .
 Don 't try to be clever .
 No .
 Please , keep it simple and brief .
 God forbid the star witness at the trial should appear intelligent .
 Intelligent , fine .
 Let 's give " smart- arse " a wide berth .
 I 'll just be myself . Are you listening to me ?

 Today , outside the Old Bailey ...
 This is the trial of the century ...
 The trial of James Moriarty ...
 James Moriarty , earlier today accused of ... .. attempting to steal the Crown Jewels .
 At the Old Bailey we have Reichenbach hero Sherlock Holmes ...
 Would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket ?
 Thanks .
 # It was boiling , I ran to the sea
 # It was boiling I ran to the sea ... #
 Crown v Moriarty , please proceed to Court 10 .
 You 're him .

 Wrong toilet .
 I 'm a big fan . Evidently .
 I read your cases , follow them all .
 Sign my shirt , would you ?
 There are two types of fans .
 Oh ?
 Catch me before I kill again , Type A. Uh- huh .
 What 's Type B ?
 Your bedroom 's just a taxi ride away .
 Hmm .
 Guess which one I am ?



 Neither . Really ?
 No , you 're not a fan at all .
 Those marks on your forearm , edge of a desk .
 You 've been typing in a hurry , probably , pressure on , facing a deadline .
 That all ?
 There 's an ink smudge on your wrist , a bulge in your jacket pocket .
 Bit of a giveaway ?
 The smudge is deliberate , to see if I 'm as good as they say I am .
 Hmm .
 Oil- based , used in newspaper print .
 But drawn on with an index finger , your finger . Hmm .
 Journalist .
 Unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press .
 You put that there to test me .
 Wow ! I 'm liking you .
 I 'd make a great feature , " Sherlock Holmes , the man beneath the hat " .
 Kitty ...
 Riley .
 Pleased to meet you .
 I 'm saving you the job of asking .
 I won 't give you an interview .
 No , I don 't want the money .
 You and John Watson , just platonic ?
 Can I put you down for a " no " there as well
 There 's all sorts of gossip in the press about you .
 Sooner or later , you 're going to need someone on your side .
 Someone to set the record straight .
 You think you 're the girl for that job , do you ?
 I 'm smart and you can trust me ... .. totally .
 Smart ?
 OK , investigative journalist .
 Good .
 Well , look at me and tell me what you see .
 If you 're that skilful , you don 't need an interview , you can just read what you need .
 No ?
 OK , my turn .
 I see someone who 's waiting for their first scoop , so their editor will notice them .
 You 're wearing an expensive skirt , that 's been rehemmed twice .
 Only posh skirt you 've got .
 Your nails , you can 't afford to do them that often .
 I see someone who 's hungry ,
 I don 't see smart .
 I don 't see trustworthy .
 I 'll give you a quote . if you like .
 Three little words .
 You repel me .
 " A consulting criminal . " Yes .
 Your words .
 Can you expand on that answer ?
 James Moriarty is for hire .
 A tradesman ? Yes .
 But not the sort who 'd fix your heating ?
 No , the sort who 'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination .
 But I 'm sure he 'd make a decent job of your boiler .
 Would you describe him as ...
 Leading .
 What ?
 You 're leading the witness .
 He 'll object and the judge 'll uphold .
 Mr Holmes . Ask me how , HOW would I describe him ?
 What opinion have I formed of him ?
 Do they not teach you this ? Mr Holmes , we are fine without your help .
 HOW would you describe this man , his character ?
 First mistake .
 James Moriarty isn 't a man at all .
 He 's a spider .
 A spider at the centre of a web , a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances .

 And how long ... ? No , no .
 Don 't , don 't do that .
 That 's really not a good question . Mr Holmes !
 How long have I known him ?
 Not your best line of enquiry .
 We met twice , five minutes in total .
 I pulled a gun , he tried to blow me up .
 I felt we had a special something .
 Miss Sorrel , are you seriously claiming this man is an expert ?
 After knowing the accused for just five minutes ?
 Two minutes would have made me an expert , five was ample .
 Mr Holmes , that 's a matter for the jury . Oh , really ?







 One librarian , two teachers , two high- pressure jobs , probably the City .
 The foreman 's a medical secretary , trained abroad , judging by her shorthand .
 Mr Holmes ?
 Seven are married , two are having an affair with each other .
 Oh , they 've just had tea and biscuits .
 Would you like to know who ate the wafer ? Mr Holmes !
 You 've been called here to answer Miss Sorrel 's questions , not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess .
 Keep your answers brief and to the point .
 Anything else will be treated as contempt .
 Do you think you could survive for just a few minutes ...
 What did I say ?
 I said don 't get clever .
 I can 't just turn it on and off like a tap .
 Well ? Well , what ?
 You were there for the whole thing , up in the gallery , start to finish .
 Like you said it would be - sat on his backside , never even stirred .
 Moriarty is not mounting any defence .
 Bank of England , Tower of London , Pentonville .
 Three of the most secure places in the country and six weeks ago , Moriarty breaks in , no- one knows how or why .
 All we know is ... He ended up in custody .
 Don 't do that . Do what ?
 The look .
 Look ?
 You 're doing the look again .
 Well , I can 't see it , can I ?
 It 's my face .
 Yes and you 're doing a " We both know what 's really going on here " face .
 We do .
 No , I don 't , which is why I find the face so annoying .
 If Moriarty wanted the jewels , he 'd have them .
 If he wanted the prisoners freed , they 'd be on the streets .
 The reason he 's still in a prison cell is cos he chose to be there .
 Somehow this is part of his scheme .
 Mr Crayhill , can we have your first witness ?
 Your Honour , we 're not calling any witnesses .
 I don 't follow .
 You 've entered a plea of not guilty .
 Nevertheless , my client is offering no evidence .
 The defence ... rests .
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury , James Moriarty stands accused ... of several counts of attempted burglary .
 Crimes which , if he 's found guilty , will elicit a very long custodial sentence , and yet ... his legal team ... has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea .

 I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly .
 You must find him guilty .
 Guilty .
 You must find him guilty .
 They 're coming back .
 That 's six minutes .
 Surprised it took them that long , to be honest .
 There 's a queue for the loo !
 Have you reached a verdict on which you all agree ?
 Not guilty , they found him not guilty .
 No defence and Moriarty 's walked free .
 Sherlock ?
 Are you listening ?
 He 's out , you know he 'll be coming after you .
 Sherl ...
 Most people knock .
 But then , you 're not most people , I suppose .
 Kettle 's just boiled .
 Johann Sebastian would be appalled .
 May I ? Please .

 You know when he was on his deathbed , Bach , he heard his son at the piano playing one of his ... pieces .
 The boy stopped before he got to the end .
 The dying man jumped out of bed , ran to the piano and finished it .
 Couldn 't cope with an unfinished melody .
 Neither can you , that 's why you 've come .
 Be honest , you 're a tiny bit pleased .
 What , with the verdict ?
 With me , back on the streets .
 Every fairy tale needs a good old- fashioned villain .
 You need me or you 're nothing .
 Because we 're just alike , you and I , except you 're boring .
 You 're on the side of the angels .
 You got to the jury , of course .
 I got into the Tower of London , you think I can 't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms ?
 Cable network .
 Every hotel bedroom has a personalised TV screen .
 And every person has their pressure point .
 Someone that they want to protect from harm .
 Easy peasy .
 So how are you going to do it ?
 Burn me ?
 Ah , that 's the problem , the final problem .
 Have you worked out what it is yet ?
 What 's the final problem ?
 I did tell you ... but did you listen ?
 How hard do you find it , having to say " I don 't know " ?
 I don 't know .
 Oh , that 's clever , very clever , awfully clever .
 Speaking of clever , have you told your little friends yet ?
 Told them what ?
 Why I broke into all those places and never took anything ? No .
 But you understand ?
 Obviously .
 Off you go , then .
 Tell you what you already know ?
 No , prove that you know it .
 You didn 't take anything because you don 't need to . Good .
 You 'll never need to take anything ever again .
 Very good , because ?
 Because nothing in the Bank of England , the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match the value of the key that could get you into all three .
 I can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code .
 No such thing as a private bank account now , they 're all mine .
 No such thing as secrecy , I OWN secrecy .
 Nuclear codes ?
 I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order .
 In a world of locked rooms , the man with the key is king .
 And honey , you should see me in a crown .
 You were advertising all through the trial , you were showing the world what you can do .
 And you were helping .
 Big client list - rogue governments , intelligence communities , terrorist cells .
 They all want me .
 Suddenly , I 'm Mr Sex .
 If you can break any bank , what do you care about the highest bidder ?
 I don 't , I just like to watch them all competing .
 " Daddy loves me the best . " Aren 't ordinary people adorable ?
 Well , you know , you 've got John .
 I should get myself a live- in one .
 Why are you doing all of this ?
 It must be so funny .
 You don 't want money or power , not really .
 What is it all for ?
 I want to solve the problem .
 Our problem .
 The final problem .
 It 's going to start very soon , Sherlock ... the fall .
 But don 't be scared , falling is just like flying , except there 's a more permanent destination .
 Never liked riddles .
 Learn to .
 Because I owe you a fall , Sherlock .
 I ... owe ... you .












 Er , excuse me , I 'm looking for Mycroft Holmes ?
 Would you happen to know if he 's around at all ?
 Can you not hear me ?
 Yes , all right . Anyone ?
 Anyone at all know ... where Mycroft Holmes is , I 've been asked to meet him here ?

 No takers , right .
 Am I invisible , can you actually see me ?
 Ah , thanks , gents .
 I 've been asked to meet Mycroft Holmes .
 What the hell ? !
 Tradition , John , our traditions define us .
 So total silence is traditional , is it ?
 You can 't even say pass the sugar ?
 Three- quarters of the diplomatic service and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley , it 's for the best , believe me .
 We don 't want a repeat of ... 1972 .

 But we can talk in here .
 You read this stuff ?
 Caught my eye . Mm- hm .
 Saturday , they 're doing a big expose .
 I 'd love to know where she got her information .
 Someone called Brook . Recognise the name ?
 School friend , maybe ?
 Of Sherlock 's ?
 But that 's not why I asked you here .
 Who 's that ?
 Don 't know ? No .
 Never seen his face before ?
 Um ...
 He 's taken a flat in Baker Street , two doors down from you .
 Hm , I was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours .
 I 'm not sure you 'll want to .
 Sulejmani , Albanian hit squad , expertly trained killer ,
 living less than 20 feet from your front door .
 Well , it 's a great location .
 Jubilee line 's handy .
 John ... What 's it got to do with me ?
 Dyachenko . Ludmila .
 Oh ...
 Actually , I think I have seen her .
 Russian killer .
 She 's taken the flat opposite .
 OK .
 I 'm sensing a pattern here .
 In fact , four top international assassins relocate to within spitting distance of 221b .
 Anything you 'd care to share with me ?
 I 'm moving ?
 It 's not hard to guess the common denominator , is it ?
 You think this is Moriarty ?
 He promised Sherlock he 'd come back .
 If this was Moriarty , we 'd be dead already .
 If not Moriarty , then who ?
 Why don 't you talk to Sherlock , if you 're so concerned about him ?
 Oh , God , don 't tell me .
 Too much history between us , John .
 Old scores , resentments .
 Nicked all his Smurfs ?
 Broke his Action Man ?
 Finished .
 We both know what 's coming , John .
 Moriarty is obsessed , he 's sworn to destroy his only rival .
 So you want me to watch out for your brother because he won 't accept your help ?
 If it 's not too much trouble ?
 Excuse me . Sorry .

 Sherlock , something weird ...
 What 's going on ?
 Kidnapping . Rufus Bruhl .
 The ambassador to the US .
 He 's in Washington , isn 't he ?
 Not him , his children .
 Max and Claudette , age seven and nine .
 They 're at St Aldates .
 Posh boarding place in Surrey .
 School broke up , the boarders went home .
 A few kids remained , including those two .
 The kids have vanished .
 The ambassador 's asked for you personally .
 The Reichenbach hero .
 Isn 't it great to be working with a celebrity ?
 We shouldn 't need to keep you for much longer .
 Thank you .
 It 's all right .
 Miss Mackenzie , House Mistress . Go easy .
 Miss Mackenzie , you 're in charge of pupil welfare , yet you left this place wide open last night .
 What are you , an idiot , a drunk or a criminal ? !
 Quickly , tell me !
 All the doors and windows were properly bolted .
 No- one , not even me , went into their room last night .
 You have to believe me !
 I do , I just wanted you to speak quickly .
 Miss Mackenzie will need to breath into a bag now .
 Six grand a term , you 'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you .
 You said the other kids had all left on their holidays .
 They were the only two sleeping on this floor .
 There 's absolutely no sign of a break- in .
 The intruder must have been hidden inside some place .

 Show me where the brother slept .
 The boy sleeps there every night .
 Gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor .
 He 'd recognise every shape , every outline , the silhouette of everyone who came to the door .
 OK , so ?
 So if someone approaches the door who he doesn 't recognise , an intruder , maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon .
 What would he do ?
 In the precious few seconds before they came into the room , how would he use them if not to cry out ?
 This little boy , this particular little boy , who reads all of those spy books , what would he do ?
 He 'd leave a sign ?
 Get Anderson !
 Linseed oil .
 Not much use , it doesn 't lead us to the kidnapper .
 Brilliant , Anderson . Really ?
 Yes , brilliant impression of an idiot .
 Floor .
 He ... made a trail for us . The boy was made to walk ahead of them .
 On what , tiptoe ?
 Indicates anxiety .
 Gun held to his head .
 The girl was pulled beside him , dragged sideways .
 He had his left arm cradled about her neck .
 That 's the end of it , we don 't know where they went from here .
 Tells us nothing after all .
 You 're right , Anderson , nothing .
 Except his shoe size , his height , his gait , his walking pace .
 Having fun ?
 Starting to .
 Maybe don 't do the smiling . Kidnapped children ?

 How could he get past the CCTV ? If all the doors were locked .
 He walked in when they weren 't locked .
 But a stranger can 't just walk into a school like that .
 Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment .
 Yesterday , end of term , parents milling around , chauffeurs , staff .
 What 's one more stranger among that lot ?
 He was waiting for them .
 All he had to do was find a place to hide .

 Molly !
 Hello , I 'm just going out .
 No , you 're not .
 I 've got a lunch date .
 Cancel it , have lunch with me .
 What ?
 I need your help .
 One of your old boyfriends , we 're tracking him down .
 He 's been naughty .
 Moriarty ?
 Of course it 's Moriarty !
 Jim wasn 't my boyfriend , we went out three times .
 I ended it .
 Then he stole the Crown Jewels , broke into the
 Bank of England and organised a prison break .
 For the sake of law and order , I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship , Molly .
 Oil , John .
 The oil in the kidnapper 's footprint .
 It 'll lead us to Moriarty .
 All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved .
 The sole of the shoe is like a passport .
 If we 're lucky , we 'll see everything he 's been up to .
 I need that analysis .
 Alkaline .
 Thank you , John .
 Molly .
 Yes .




 I ... O ... U.
 Glycerol molecule .

 What are you ?
 What did you mean , IOU ?
 You said IOU .
 You were muttering it while you were working .
 Nothing , mental note .
 You 're a bit like my dad . He 's dead .
 No , sorry .
 Molly , please don 't feel the need to make conversation , it 's really not your area .
 When he was dying , he was always cheerful , he was lovely , except when he thought no- one could see .
 I saw him once , he looked sad . Molly .

 You look sad , when you think he can 't see you .
 Are you OK ?
 And don 't just say you are , because I know what that means ,
 looking sad when you think no- one can see you .
 You can see me .
 I don 't count .
 What I 'm trying to say is , that if there 's anything I can do , anything you need , anything at all , you can have me .
 No , I just mean , I mean , if there 's anything you need , it 's fine .
 But what can I need from you ?
 Nothing .
 I don 't know .
 You could probably say thank you , actually .
 Thank you ?
 I 'm just going to go and get some crisps .
 Do you want anything ?
 It 's OK , I know you don 't .
 Well , actually , maybe I 'll ...
 I know you don 't .
 Sherlock ? Hmm ?
 This envelope that was in her trunk , there 's another one .
 What ?
 On our doorstep . Found it today .
 Yes , and look at that .
 Look at that , exactly the same seal .
 Breadcrumbs . Uh- huh .
 It was there when I got back .
 A little trace of breadcrumbs .
 Hardback copy of Fairy Tales .

 Two children led into the forest by a wicked father , follow a little trail of breadcrumbs .
 That 's Hansel and Gretel .
 What sort of kidnapper leaves clues ?
 The sort that likes to boast , that thinks it 's a game .
 He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me ...
 " All fairy tales need a good old- fashioned villain . "
 The fifth substance , it 's part of the tale .
 The witch 's house .
 What ?
 The glycerol molecule .
 PGPR ! What 's that ?

 It 's used in making chocolate .
 This fax arrived an hour ago .
 What have you got for us ?
 We need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect .
 Chalk , asphalt , brick dust , vegetation . What - chocolate ? !
 I think we 're looking for a disused sweet factory .
 We need to narrow that down .
 A sweet factory with asphalt ? No , too general .
 Something more specific .
 Chalk , chalky clay .
 That 's a far thinner band of geology .
 Brick dust ?
 Building site .
 Bricks from the 1950s .
 There 's thousands of building sites in London .
 I 've got people out looking .
 So have I !
 Homeless network , faster than the police , far more relaxed about taking bribes .
 John .
 Rhododendron ponticum .
 Matches .
 Addlestone .
 What ?
 A mile of disused factories between the river and the park , matches everything .
 Right , come on .
 Come on !
 OK , you look over there .
 Look everywhere .
 OK , spread out , please , spread out .
 Quietly , quietly !
 This was alight moments ago .
 They 're still here !
 Sweet wrappers ?
 What 's he been feeding you ?
 Hansel and Gretel .
 Ugh !
 Mercury . What ?
 The papers , they 're painted with mercury , lethal .
 The more they ate ...
 It was killing them .
 But it 's not enough to kill them on its own .
 Taken in large enough quantities , eventually it would kill them .
 He didn 't need to be there for the execution .
 Murder by remote control , he could be 1, 000 miles away .
 The hungrier they got , the more they ate , the faster they died .
 Neat .
 Sherlock .
 Over here !
 I 've got him , don 't worry .
 Right then , the professionals are finished .
 If the amateurs want to go in and have their turn .
 Now remember , she 's in shock and she 's just seven years old , so , anything you can do to ...
 Not be myself ?
 Yeah , might be helpful .
 Claudette , I ...
 No , no , I know it 's been hard for you .
 Claudette , listen to me .
 Out .
 Get out !
 Makes no sense . Kid 's traumatised .
 Something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper .
 What 's she said ?
 Hasn 't uttered another syilable .
 And the boy ? No , he 's unconscious .
 He 's still in intensive care .
 Don 't let it get to you ,
 I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room .
 In fact , so do most people .
 Come on .
 Brilliant work you did finding those kids from just a footprint , it 's really amazing .
 Thank you .
 Unbelievable .
 Ah .
 You OK ? Thinking .

 This is my cab , you get the next one .
 Why ?
 You might talk .
 ' Is this chocolate ? ' 'We 're looking for a disused sweet factory . '
 ' Get out ! '
 ' Aaaargh ! '
 Problem ?
 ' .. this stunning evening wear set from us at London Taxi Shopping .
 Can you turn this off , please ?
 'The set comprises of a beautiful ... '
 Can you turn this off ? !
 ' Accompanied by four spangly diamond bracelets ... '
 Hello .
 Are you ready for the story ?
 This is the story of Sir Boast- a- lot .
 A footprint , it 's all he had .
 A footprint .
 Yeah , well , you know what he 's like .
 CSI Baker Street .
 Well , our boys couldn 't have done it .
 Well , that 's why we need him , he 's better .
 That 's one explanation .
 And what 's the other ?
 Sir Boast- a- lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the round table .
 But soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories about how brave he was and how many dragons he 'd slain .
 And soon they began to wonder , " Are Sir Boast- a- lot 's stories even true ? "
 Only he could have found that evidence .
 Oh , no .
 The girl screams her head off when she sees him - a man she has never seen before , unless she had seen him before .
 What 's your point ?
 You know what it is , you just don 't want to think about it .
 So , all of the knights went to King Arthur and said ,
 " I don 't believe Sir Boast- a- lot 's stories .
 " He 's just a big old liar who makes things up to make himself look good . "
 You 're not seriously suggesting he 's involved , are you ?
 We have to entertain the possibility .
 And then , even the King began to wonder .
 But that wasn 't the end of Sir Boast- a- lot 's problem .
 No .
 That wasn 't the final problem .
 The end .
 Stop the cab .
 Stop the cab !
 What was that ? !
 What was that ?
 No charge .
 Watch out !
 Thank you .
 Sherlock !
 That is him . It 's him .
 Sulejmani or something , Mycroft showed me his file .
 He 's a big Albanian gangster , lives two doors down from us .
 He died because I shook his hand .
 What ?
 He saved my life , but he couldn 't touch me .
 Why ?
 Four assassins living right on our doorstep .
 They haven 't come here to kill me .
 They have to keep me alive .
 I 've got something that all of them want .
 But if one of them approaches me ...
 The others kill them before they can get it .
 All of the attention is focused on me .
 There 's a surveillance web closing in on us right now .
 So what have you got that 's so important ?
 I need to ask about the dusting .
 Precise details , in the last week , what 's been cleaned ?
 Tuesday , I did your lino .
 No , this room , this is where we 'll find it .
 Any break in the dust line .
 You can put back anything but dust . Dust is eloquent .
 What 's he on about ?
 Cameras , we 're being watched .
 What ? ! Cameras ?
 Here ?
 I 'm in my nightie !
 No , Inspector .
 Why ?
 The answer 's no .
 You 've not heard the question !
 You want to take me to the station .
 Saving you the trouble of asking .
 Sherlock .
 The scream ?
 Yeah .
 Who was it ? Donovan ?
 I bet it was Donovan .
 " Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping ? "
 Ha ha , Moriarty is smart .
 He planted that doubt in her head .
 That little nagging sensation .
 You 're going to have to be strong to resist .
 You can 't kill an idea , can you ?
 Not once it 's made a home ... there .
 Will you come ?
 One photograph , that 's his next move .
 Moriarty 's game .
 First the scream , then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning .
 He wants to destroy me inch by inch .
 It is a game , Lestrade , and not one I 'm willing to play .
 Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan .
 They 'll be deciding .
 Deciding ?
 Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me .
 You think ?
 Standard procedure .
 You should have gone with him .
 People 'll think ...
 I don 't care what people think .
 You 'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong .
 No , that would just make them stupid or wrong .
 Sherlock , I don 't want the world believing you 're ...
 That I am what ?
 A fraud .
 You 're worried they 're right . What ?
 That they 're right about me .
 No .
 That 's why you 're upset .
 You can 't entertain the possibility they may be right .
 You 're afraid you 've been taken in .
 I 'm not .
 Moriarty is playing with your mind , too .
 Can 't you SEE what 's going on ? !
 No , I know you for real .
 100 percent ?
 Well , nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time .
 Sherlock Holmes ? Yes , sir .
 That bloke that 's been in the press ?
 Mm- hm .
 I thought he was some sort of private eye . He is .
 We 've been consulting with him , that 's what you 're telling me ?
 Not used him on any proper cases though , have we ?
 Well , one or two .
 Or 20 or 30 .
 What ? !
 I 'm not the only senior officer who did this .
 Gregson ...
 Shut up !
 An amateur detective given access to all sorts of classified information .
 And now he 's a suspect in a case .
 With all due respect ... You 're a bloody idiot , Lestrade !
 Now go and fetch him in , right now .
 Do it !
 Proud of yourselves ?
 Well , what if it 's not just this case ?
 What if he 's done this to us every single time ?
 So , still got some friends on the force .
 It 's Lestrade .
 Says they 're all coming over here now .
 Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs .
 Every officer you 've ever made feel like a tit , which is a lot of people .
 Yoo- hoo .
 Oh , sorry , am I interrupting ?
 Some chap delivered a parcel , I forgot , marked perishable .
 I had to sign for it .
 Funny name , German , like the fairy tales .
 Burnt to a crisp .
 What does it mean ?
 ' Police ! ' I 'll go .
 ' Sherlock .
 ' Excuse me , Mrs Hudson .
 We need to talk to you .
 ' You can 't just barge in like that ! '
 - 'Have you got a warrant ?
 - Have you ? '
 ' Leave it , John .
 ' Eh ?
 Manners ! '
 Sherlock Holmes , I 'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping .
 It 's OK , John .
 He 's not resisting .
 No , it 's not all right , this is ridiculous .
 Get him downstairs now .
 You don 't have to do this .
 Don 't try to interfere or I shall arrest you too .
 You done ?
 I said it . Hmm ?
 First time we met .
 Don 't bother .
 Solving crimes won 't be enough .
 One day he 'll cross the line .
 Now ask yourself , what sort of man would kidnap those kids just so he can impress us all by finding them ?
 Donovan ?
 Sir ?
 Got our man ?
 Er , yes , sir .
 Looked a bit of a weirdo , if you ask me .
 Often are , these vigilante types .
 What are you looking at ?
 Are you all right , sir ?
 Joining me ? Yeah .
 Well , apparently it 's against the law to chin the Chief Superintendent .
 Hmm .
 Bit awkward this .
 There 's no- one to bail us .
 I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape .
 ' All units to 27 . ' What ?
 ' All units to 2 ... '
 Aah !
 Ladies and gentlemen , will you all please get on your knees ?
 NOW would be good ! Do as he says !

 Just so you 're aware , the gun is his idea , I 'm just a ... you know .
 My hostage .
 Hostage , yes , that works .
 That works .
 So what now ?
 Doing what Moriarty wants , becoming a fugitive . Run !

 Get after him , Lestrade !
 Take my hand .
 Now people will definitely talk .
 The gun ! Leave it !

 Sherlock , wait !
 We 're going to need to coordinate .
 Go to your right . Huh ?
 Go to your right .
 Everybody wants to believe it , that 's what makes it so clever .
 A lie that 's preferable to the truth .
 My deductions were a sham .
 No- one feels inadequate , Sherlock 's an ordinary man .
 Mycroft , he could help us .
 Big family reconciliation , now 's not really the moment .
 Sherlock ... we 're being followed .
 I knew we couldn 't outrun the police .
 That 's not the police , it 's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street .
 Let 's see if he can give us some answers .
 Where are we going ?
 We 're going to jump in front of that bus .
 Oof !
 Oh ...
 Tell me what you want from me .
 Tell me !
 He left it at your flat .
 Who ? Moriarty .
 What ?
 The computer key code . Of course .
 He 's selling it .
 The programme he used to break into the Tower .
 He planted it when he came around .
 It 's a game- changer .
 It 's a key , it can break into any system and it 's sitting in our flat right now .
 That 's why he left that message , telling everyone where to come , " Get Sherlock ! "
 We need to get back into the flat and search .
 ClD will be camped out .
 Why plant it on you ?
 It 's another subtle way of smearing my name , now I 'm best pals with all those criminals .
 Yeah , well , have you seen this ?
 A kiss- and- tell .
 Some bloke called Rich Brook .
 Who is he ?
 Too late to go on the record ?
 Congratulations , " The Truth About Sherlock Holmes . "
 The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it . Bravo !
 I gave you your opportunity .
 I wanted to be on your side , remember ?
 You turned me down , so ...
 Then lo and behold , someone spills all the beans .
 How utterly convenient .
 Who is Brook ?
 Oh , come on , Kitty , no- one trusts the voice at the end of a phone .
 All those little meetings in cafes , those sessions in the hotel room when he gabbled into your Dictaphone .
 How do you know that you can trust him ?
 A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets .
 What were his credentials ?
 Darling , they didn 't have any ground coffee , so I just got normal .
 You said that they wouldn 't find me here , you said that I 'd be safe here .
 You are safe .
 Richard , I 'm a witness , they wouldn 't harm you in front of witnesses .
 So that 's your source ?
 Moriarty is Richard Brook ?
 Of course he 's Richard Brook , there is no Moriarty .
 There never has been .
 What are you talking about ?
 Look him up .
 Rich Brook , an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty .
 Dr Watson , I know you 're a good man , don 't , don 't , don 't hurt me .
 No , you are Moriarty !
 He 's Moriarty !
 We 've met , remember ?
 You were going to blow me up !
 I 'm sorry .
 I 'm sorry .
 He paid me , I needed the work .
 I 'm an actor , I was out of work .
 Sherlock , you 'd better explain , because I am not getting this .
 I 'll be doing the explaining , in print .
 It 's all here , conclusive proof .
 You invented James Moriarty , your nemesis . Invented him ? !
 Mm- hm .
 He invented all the crimes , actually .
 And to cap it all , he made up a master villain .
 Don 't be ridiculous !
 Ask him .
 He 's right here .
 Just ask him .
 Tell him , Richard .
 For God 's sake , this man was on trial !
 Yes , and you paid him to take the rap .
 Promised you 'd rig the jury .
 Not exactly a West End role , but I 'll bet the money was good .
 But not so good he didn 't want to sell his story .
 I am sorry . I am .
 I am sorry .
 So this is the story you 're going to publish ?
 The big conclusion of it all , Moriarty 's an actor ?
 He knows I am .
 I have proof .
 Show them ...
 Kitty , show them something .
 Yeah , show me something .
 I 'm on TV .
 I 'm on kids ' TV .
 I 'm the story- teller .


 I 'm the story- teller .
 It 's on DVD .

 Just tell him .
 It 's all coming out .
 It 's all over .
 Just tell them . Just tell them .
 Tell them !
 It 's all over now !
 No !
 Don 't you touch me !
 Don 't you lay a finger on me !
 Stop it now !
 Don 't hurt me !
 Don 't let him get away !
 Leave him alone !
 No , no , no .
 He 'll have back- up .
 Do you know what , Sherlock Holmes ?
 I look at you know and I can read you ... and you repel me .
 Can he do that ?
 Completely change his identity , make you the criminal ?
 He 's got my whole life story .
 That 's what you do when you sell a big lie , you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable .
 It 'll be your word against his .
 He 's been sowing doubt into people 's minds for 24 hours .
 There 's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game and that ...
 Sherlock ?
 There 's something I need to do .
 What ?
 Can I help ?
 No , on my own .
 You 're wrong , you know ?
 You do count .
 You 've always counted and I 've always trusted you .
 But you were right .
 I 'm not OK .
 Tell me what 's wrong .
 Molly , I think I 'm going to die .
 If I wasn 't everything that you think I am , everything that I think I am ... .. would you still want to help me ? What do you need ?



 What do you need ?
 You .
 She has really done her homework , Miss Riley , and it 's things that only someone close to Sherlock could know .
 Ah .
 Have you seen your brother 's address book lately ?
 Two names - yours and mine ... and Moriarty didn 't get this stuff from me .
 John ... So how does it work , your relationship ?
 Do you go out for a coffee now and then , you and Jim ?
 Your own brother and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac .
 I never intend ... I never dreamt ...
 This ... this is what you were trying to tell me , isn 't it ?
 " Watch his back because I 've made a mistake . "
 How did you meet him ?
 People like him , we know about them , we watch them .
 But James Moriarty ... .. the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen , and , in his pocket , the ultimate weapon .
 The key code .
 A few lines of computer code that can unlock any door .
 And you abducted him to try and find the key code ?
 Interrogated him for weeks .
 And ?
 He wouldn 't play along .
 He just sat there staring into the darkness .
 The only thing that made him open up ...
 I could get him to talk , just a little .
 But ...
 In return you had to offer him Sherlock 's life story .
 So , one big lie ... .. Sherlock 's a fraud , and people will swallow it because the rest of it 's true .
 Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed , right , and you have given him the perfect ammunition .
 John .
 I 'm sorry .
 Oh , please !
 Tell him , would you ?
 I got your message .
 The computer code is the key to this .
 We find it , we can use it .
 Use it ?
 He used it to create a false identity so we can break into the records and destroy Richard Brook .
 Bring back Jim Moriarty again .
 Somewhere in 221b , somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden .
 Uh- huh .
 What did he touch ?
 An apple , nothing else .
 Did he write anything down ?
 No .


 Oh .
 Yeah , speaking .
 What ?
 What happened ?
 Is she OK ?
 Oh , my God !
 Right , yes , I 'm coming .
 What is it ? Paramedics .
 Mrs Hudson 's been shot .
 How ?
 Probably one of the killers you managed to attract .
 Jesus !
 She 's dying , Sherlock .
 Let 's go .
 You go .
 I 'm busy .
 Busy ? !
 Thinking .
 I need to think .
 You need to ... ?
 Doesn 't she mean anything to you ?
 You once half- killed a man because he laid a finger on her .
 She 's my landlady .
 She 's dying ... you machine !
 Sod this . Sod this !
 You stay here if you want , on your own .
 Alone is what I have .
 Alone protects me .
 No , friends protect people .

 # I 've been kicked around since I was born
 # But now it 's all right , it 's OK
 # You can look the other way
 # We can try to understand
 # The New York Times ' effect on man
 # Whether you 're a brother or whether you 're a mother
 # You 're stayin ' alive ... #
 Well ... here we are at last .
 You and me , Sherlock .
 And our problem - the final problem .
 Staying alive !
 It 's so boring , isn 't it ?
 It 's just staying .
 All my life I 've been searching for distractions and you were the best distraction and now I don 't even have you because I 've beaten you .
 And you know what ?
 In the end , it was easy .
 It was easy .
 Now I 've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people , and it turns out you 're ordinary , just like all of them .
 Ah , well .
 Did you almost start to wonder if I was real ?
 Did I nearly get you ?
 Richard Brook .
 Nobody seems to get the joke , but you do .
 Of course .
 Attaboy .
 Richard Brook in German is Reichenbach .
 The case that made my name .
 Just trying to have some fun .
 Good .
 You got that too .
 Beats like digits .
 Every beat is a one , every rest is a zero .
 Binary code .
 That 's why all those assassins tried to save my life .
 It was hidden on me , hidden inside my head .
 A few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system .
 Told all my clients , last one to Sherlock is a sissy .
 But now that it 's up here , I can use it to alter all the records .
 I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty .
 No , no , no , no , no .
 This is too easy .
 This is too easy .
 There is no key , doofus !
 Those digits are meaningless .
 They 're utterly meaningless .
 You don 't really think a couple of lines of computer code are going to crash the world around our ears ?
 I 'm disappointed in you , ordinary Sherlock .
 But the rhythm ... Partita no 1 !
 Thank you , Johann Sebastian Bach .
 But then how did you ... ?
 How did I break into the bank , to the Tower , to the prison ?
 Daylight robbery !
 All it takes is some willing participants .

 I knew you 'd fall for it .
 That 's your weakness .
 You always want everything to be clever .
 Shall we finish the game ?
 One final act .
 Glad you chose a tall building .
 Nice way to do it .
 Do it ?
 Do what ?
 Yes , of course .
 My suicide .
 Genius detective proved to be a fraud .
 I read it in the paper so it must be true .
 I love newspapers .
 Fairy tales .
 And pretty grim ones too .
 Oh , God , John , you made me jump .
 Is everything OK with the police ?
 Has Sherlock sorted it all out ?
 Oh , my God .
 Taxi !
 Taxi ! No , no , no .
 Police ... sort of !
 Thanks , mate .
 Thanks a lot !
 I can prove that you created an entirely false identity .
 Oh , just kill yourself .
 It 's a lot less effort .
 Go on .
 For me .
 Please !
 You 're insane .
 You 're just getting that now ?
 Wo- wo- wo !
 OK .
 Let me give you a little extra incentive .
 Your friends will die if you don 't .
 John ? Not just John .
 Everyone .

 Mrs Hudson ?
 Everyone .
 Lestrade ?
 Three bullets , three gunmen , three victims .
 There 's no stopping them now ... .. unless my people see you jump .
 You can have me arrested , you can torture me , you can do anything you like with me , but nothing 's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger .
 Your only three friends in the world will die unless ...
 Unless I kill myself and complete your story .
 You 've got to admit , that 's sexier .
 And I die in disgrace .
 Of course .
 That 's the point of this .
 Oh .
 You 've got an audience now .
 Off you pop .
 Go on .
 I told you how this ends .
 Your death is the only thing that 's going to call off the killers .
 I 'm certainly not going to do it .
 Would you give me one moment , please ?
 One moment of privacy .
 Please .
 Of course .
 What ? !
 What is it ?
 What did I miss ?
 You 're not going to do it .
 So the killers can be called off , then there 's a recall code or a word or a number .
 I don 't have to die if I 've got you .
 Oh !
 You think you can make me stop the order ?
 You think you can make me do that ?
 Yes .
 So do you .
 Sherlock , your big brother and all the King 's horses couldn 't make me do a thing I didn 't want to .
 Yes , but I 'm not my brother , remember ?
 I am you .
 Prepared to do anything .
 Prepared to burn .
 Prepared to do what ordinary people won 't do .
 You want me to shake hands with you in hell ?
 I shall not disappoint you .
 Nah .
 You talk big .
 Nah .
 You 're ordinary .
 You 're ordinary .
 You 're on the side of the angels .
 Oh , I may be on the side of the angels , but don 't think for one second that I am one of them .
 No ... .. you 're not .
 I see .
 You 're not ordinary .
 No .
 You 're me .
 You 're me .
 Thank you ... .. Sherlock Holmes .
 Thank you .
 Bless you .
 As long as I 'm alive , you can save your friends , you 've got a way out .
 Well , good luck with that .

 No .
 Yes , sir .
 Thank you .
 Bye .
 Hello ? John .
 Hey , Sherlock .
 Are you OK ?
 Turn around and walk back the way you came .
 I 'm coming in .
 Just do as I ask !
 Please .
 Where ?
 Stop there .
 Sherlock ? OK , look up .
 I 'm on the rooftop .
 Oh , God .
 I ... I can 't come down , so we 'll just have to do it like this .
 What 's going on ?
 An apology .
 It 's all true .
 What ?
 Everything they said about me . I invented Moriarty .

 Why are you saying this ?
 I 'm a fake .
 Sherlock ... The newspapers were right all along .
 I want you to tell Lestrade ,
 I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly .
 In fact , tell anyone who will listen to you ... .. that I created Moriarty for my own purposes .
 OK , shut up Sherlock .
 Shut up .
 The first time we met ... the first time we met , you knew all about my sister , right ?
 Nobody could be that clever .
 You could .
 I researched you .
 Before we met , I discovered everything that I could to impress you .
 It 's a trick .
 Just a magic trick .
 No .
 All right , stop it now .
 No .
 Stay exactly where you are .
 Don 't move .
 All right .
 Keep your eyes fixed on me .
 Please , will you do this for me ?
 Do what ?
 This phone call , it 's ... .. it 's my note .
 It 's what people do , don 't they ?
 Leave a note ?
 Leave a note when ?
 Goodbye , John . No .
 Don 't ...

 Sherlock !
 Sherlock .
 Sherlock ... Sherlock .
 I 'm a doctor , let me come through .
 Let me come through , please .
 He 's my friend . He 's my friend ...
 Please .

 Please , let me just ...
 Oh , Jesus !
 No .
 God , no .

 There 's stuff that you wanted to say ... .. but didn 't say it .
 Yeah .
 Say it now .
 Sorry , I can 't .
 There 's all the stuff .
 All the science equipment .
 I left it all in boxes .
 I don 't know what needs doing .
 I thought I 'd take it to a school .
 Would you ... ?
 I can 't go back to the flat again , not at the moment .
 I 'm angry .
 It 's OK , John .
 There 's nothing unusual in that .
 That 's the way he made everyone feel .
 All the marks on my table and the noise , firing guns at half past one in the morning ... Yeah . .. bloody specimens in my fridge . Imagine , keeping bodies where there 's food .




 Yes .
 And the fighting !
 Drove me up the wall with all his carryings- on .
 Listen , I 'm not actually that angry , OK ?
 OK .
 I 'll leave you alone to , you know ...
 Erm ...
 Hmm . You ... you told me once ... .. that you weren 't a hero .
 Erm , there were times I didn 't even think you were human , but let me tell you this , you were ... the best man ... the most human ... human being that I 've ever known and no- one will ever convince me that you told me a lie , so ... .. there .




 I was so alone ... .. and I owe you so much .
 But , please , there 's just one more thing , one more thing , one more miracle , Sherlock , for me , don 't be ... .. dead .
 Would you do that just for me ?
 Just stop it . Stop this .
