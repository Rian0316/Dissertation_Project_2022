and a gay cable worker ?
I didn 't know he was gay
I didn 't know Justin was gay the answer to every question
Gabby , she committed suicide
Something must have happened all we have to do is watch
there 's a woman inside
She was stuffed in the end, all the secrets
Do you know where Paul Young is?
I know the answer to where he goes back will be revealed on Tuesday night
Someone has been threatening Mary Alice ?
Mary Alice , ? What exactly did you do ?
My name is Mary Alice Young Before I died, my life was full of love, laughter, friendship, and sadness
secret
The secret comes from fifteen years ago was that my name or Angela Forrest my life was full of despair
Every morning, whenever I make breakfast for my husband
I can feel the despair
can you stop by the supermarket today
Great, I 've run out of shaving cream
Busy, it 's the afternoon
Double deals on Friday
If you go on a Friday, you 'll save a lot of money even at night, when I 'm at work
what a lovely wall calendar
Did you get it from nearby ?
No, that 's from Airview
I have a relative there
Does it have a idyllic mood?
Angela , you can give me one every day

Every day is grey and meaningless
suddenly one night
Hi ANGELA ? The colors are lit up
D E I R D R E .
What are you doing here?
I need money
De eirdre , for you
You 're on drugs again, aren 't you?
No, I just, um. . .
I just want to get some food for my kids and others
If the baby is hungry, we can go to the supermarket and I will buy something to eat
I can buy things for my own kids, okay?
be quiet, i can 't think anymore
See the watch yet? It 's worth a lot
I 'll sell it to you for fifty bucks
she won 't give you money
Do not you mind ?
Angela , only you still treat me as a person
please don 't reject me
I am sorry
I sold you the child
what ?
I heard I know you can 't have children and it hurts you
I think you should go
no i was thinking about D ana
you will give him a wonderful home
ok? he 'll be happier
quiet, quiet
Dear
How much money do you have at home?
She has a ten-month-old baby. Where 's the baby?
I don 't know if we saw a child
We certainly won 't let him
Sitting alone in the middle of an abandoned house If something happens to the child, I 'll find you
let me work
We have a police officer at the bedside of the drug addict
If she wakes up we 'll let her tell us where she put the baby
I hope you have a great time at F airview
thank you we had a great time
wave goodbye to ZACH
Wave
We became the happiest family
Until that night . . .
Three years later . . .
When someone knocks on the door . . .
Despair comes again
C L O S E D   C A P T I O N I N G   S P O N S O R E D   B Y   F O R D .
S I X   A L L - N E V E H I C L E S ,   E A C H   B U I L T   F O R   T H E   R O A D   A H E A D .
It 's five o 'clock in the morning in Wisteria Lane and when the phone rang everyone knew something was wrong
From the first ring of the phone
Hey ?
After all, there is such an unwritten rule in the community.
Hello? Don 't hang up your neighbors in the middle of the night . . . unless you have bad news
Hello? So they all came here without combing their hair, with their faces turned upside down
They are here because . . .
After so many years . . .
BREE . They 're not just neighbors anymore
What are you doing here?
We heard that Rex had a heart attack. How is he?
Um. . .
He 's stabilized, but they 're getting a pacemaker so they 're going to operate on him
How did you know?
Danielle 's call
How are you doing ?
We were arguing when he had a heart attack and I felt so guilty I should have brought him here sooner
Honey, the doctors here are the best
He 's still so young, he 'll recover
I 'm sure you don 't have to worry about anything
do you know ?
I 'm so glad you guys are here I 'm so glad I 've been trying to be strong
If you keep comforting me
Will you lose courage?
then we don 't say anything
thanks
Let 's talk about unimportant things
Oh, I know. Hmm. . .
I found Huber 's diary in Mike 's stuff
I think she knows some secrets about Mary Alice and keeps threatening her
yes he will
Z A C H A R Y !
come back soon
Your father said to leave for a while
He said he wanted me to take care of you
I 'll be fine by myself, I 'm not a child anymore
I know you 're not a kid anymore I think we should discuss it
i 'm really fine
Why are you asking for trouble When can you come home with me?
let me do this
it 's my honour
Shut up! You 're a lunatic?
Can you leave me alone for a while? You 're not my mother!
I said I 'm fine
Don 't be like my mother, bring me home
I wish things could be that easy Z achary even for you it 's not easy
your father is not coming back
He said he would
he lied to you
I wanted to tell you, but your father discussed it with me and he decided not to come back
Now, pick up your bag and we 'll go home
I won 't let you be a child
What did you do to my dad?
Ahhh! Tell me!
Mrs Applewhile ?
whats the matter ?
Hi. I 'm E die B ritt

Sell ​​the house to your real estate agent ?
oh yes hi !
Hi !
I 've always been curious to see you
real ?
i never get over the phone
sold the house
You are so amazing, you bought a house without looking at it
Not exactly, we 've seen the advert and that 's exactly what we 're looking for
This is my son Matthew
nice to meet you, ma 'am
Please call me EDIE.
The title 'Mrs.' is more suitable for older women
say she
You can call her 'Mrs.' anytime you want
So do you two think everything is fine?
Because we still have a routine profile of a real estate agent that we haven 't done yet.
everything is fine
Oh dear, then the contract is delivered
Now let me teach you where water leaks when it rains
EDIE , this house is very nice
But it 's really nice of you to drop by
All right
this is my name card
call me anytime
goodbye
The people here are friendly
Yes
Yes, they are
MIKE, hi dear, hope you are doing well with the work at hand
uh, I hope you don 't get mad but I found Mrs. Huber 's diary in your truck and, well, I couldn 't help but read it, so I looked
And then, uh, I got all the ins and outs of the whole blackmail
Please give me a call back and let 's talk
love you goodbye
I 've never heard back and I 'm a little worried about you
A few of us girls discussed it and, well, we guessed if PAULYOUNG killed Mrs. Huber if it was him
Then maybe the murderer of your ex-girlfriend is also him
Looks like we really need to talk, please call me back
i love you goodbye
I think the only purpose of having a cell phone is to be able to find you when someone wants to talk to you
How can our relationship survive if you don 't communicate with me?
MIKE, call me back, I 'm serious!
love you goodbye
I apologize for the last message
Well, we can take that as some words of concern
I just really want to talk to you, and...
can you wait? I have a call to answer
Hey?
hey it 's me
Oh my gosh, where have you been?
uh, the phone reception here is very bad, I just got your message
Well, I 'm sorry for that message just now
I 'm just, um... .
Too upset?
Yeah, just think that 's too disturbing
Hmm. . . how did you get MARTHAHUBER 's diary?
Oh, well, it was given to me by her sister, Mrs. TILMAN
She helped me with my investigation
I think we should really give that diary to the police
uh yes
Yes, of course that is true?
Of course, really
Once I 'm done with the work at hand we 'll meet the detective what 's the name of it... umm Copeland
very good
This is good
Okay, so, I 'll see you in a few hours?
OK
But hurry up, okay?
I have a hunch that Paul Young is the key to this whole mystery
Well, don 't jump to conclusions
What are you doing here?
I 'm here to testify against you in court
- Can you untie him? - yes, ma 'am
I don 't want to serve him dressing
Thank you for doing this, GABBY
And beat up another gay man?
really embarrassing
Yes, uh, CARLOS, generally beating someone up is not allowed
So why did you change your mind?
Well, I 'm going to be your baby 's mom and that means a lot of responsibilities and less time for myself
So if I save you from this trouble - and you 're going to reciprocate accordingly - ok

If the baby starts crying in the middle of the night, you have to get up and take care of it without a word
Meeting with the doctor--
You drive, I don 't want to put a small seat on my Maserati
OK
The bottle is also your responsibility
i.e. cleaning, sanitizing, and milking
That way, I can live a decent life and I 'll hate you less
ok, that 's it
So we have an agreement?
see you in court
Hey, GABBY ?
Are we breastfeeding?
oh dear it 's up to you if you have it too
Can I buy my own pizza?
You can, as long as you can afford it

Wow! Awesome 19 out of 19, 19 out of 19

Look at PENNY and wait for me here, okay?
T O M
Good! Headed in!
20 points out
TOM what are you doing?
How do I look when I 'm playing air hockey?
KEVIN , it 's your turn
It 's only noon, shouldn 't you be working?
no i quit
don 't you
have
Yesterday I told PETERSON he could hold on
You 're not hitting KEVIN at all
fight
Can you talk to me?
I do not understand
What? Your name is Peterson 's wife
promise he won 't lift me
So he greatly promoted ANNABEL and I resigned
What else do you not understand?
All right
All right
Can we go home and talk, please?
No, no, come on! underdogs
Are you going to . . . play games here all day?
Haha no, I 'm going to get some ice cream and then I 'm going to the lake and maybe rent a boat
Do whatever you want, oh my god!
in!
TOM goes home to LYNETTE
Go home before I say something I 'll regret
ok you
You can get your bike back when you score in the next round
What are you thinking ?
I 'm just um. . . thinking about the spring cleaning
you haven 't done it yet
No, I have to clear the drain and also, under the refrigerator
I just can 't tell you how long it 's been since I changed the pads
We 'll be married when your surgery is over.
How did you find out?
Look, you don 't think I 'm paying attention after so many years
but i am
Do you know why I saved it until the end?
Do not
Because it reminds me of Aunt Fern 3 6 3 0 0 : 1 6 : 2 3 , 1 3 4 - -&gt; 0 0 : 1 6 : 2 6 , 8 3 3 The day we got married I told him how happy I was
She told me to remember even the worst of times that the best is yet to come
i think of you and the kids
And our life, how right is she?
They want me to have surgery
I know
Just in case I have to say something
REX you don 't have to say anything
I 'm sorry . . . for all the things I 've done
Separation . . . it doesn 't matter

Can we be evened out from now on?
All right
thanks
With these data records . . . you will survive the surgery
How are you so sure?
Because I told you - - the best is yet to come
See you on Sunday then don 't forget to feed BONGO
oh thanks i will do it now
Get in the car, sweetheart
I need to talk to your mother quickly
You 're going to continue living in sin with a plumber/ex?
It 's funny how you mentioned sin
I would like to categorize it this way, adultery is a sin, right?
I don 't like that man around JULIE
He is a good man
MIKE is fine, Dad
He cared so much about us and I liked that he was around me too
don 't mess up
did you hear your daughter
he 's just a plumber
Be good, BONGO or I 'll let you go to bed hungry
Hello Ms. MAYER
please sit down
I 'll go get some water
I don 't think so
don 't respond
I know you are there, SUSAN.
i can see you
If you don 't want to talk to me
At least politely hide
ok, but don 't let her in
EDIE , what a pleasant surprise
Are you there for Mike?
No, what 's wrong with him having a big case?
Can I come in? Why?
I want to inform all my neighbors that FELICATILMAN was attacked
real ?
in YOUNG 's house
They just took her away in an ambulance and I was terrified
My workers haven 't arrived at the construction site yet
I was there alone, so do you think maybe I could come in for a while? Patience—what?

get out
God you 're such a bitch
why ?
I want Mrs. TILMAN to tell me the truth about my father
she did
what did she say ?
Delfino took my father and killed him
Now I 'm going to kill Mr. Delfino
Court, this whole mess was caused by my loneliness
My marriage has been a little strained since CARLOS was convicted--
No one has been convicted Mrs SOLIS
It 's just a grand jury hearing oh no no I mean another crime
Oh
ok go on
He was under house arrest but he 's a jealous man and every time I leave the house he 's kind of crazy
He knows how a man sees me and I didn 't appease him
I . . wrongly made him think I had an affair
Also, before CARLOS was put under house arrest, he was always working, not with me at all
I think maybe if he thinks I 'm having an affair he 'll realize he loves me
I know it sounds stupid
I 'm just- -
Is there a conclusion? My conclusion is that CARLOS is an angry jealous barbarian 4 6 4 0 0 : 2 2 : 4 1 , 8 0 1 - -&gt; 0 0 : 2 2 : 4 3 , 5 0 0 but not a gay attacker

Okay, I 've heard enough, a lawyer please come here
I gotta be honest, I don 't think we have a hate crime
I just let you know you typed the wrong person
Don 't you think it 's weird? You only have a lawn on Wisteria Street and need to mow three times a week
You are dead
You are dead, you are dead!
Aha! CARLOS!
D E A D !
[Spanish]
For God 's sake people stop him
stop !
Be in order!
I am going to kill you !
Who did it - - I 'm going to kill you!
order !
Ladies and gentlemen please sit down
orderly

I don 't want to justify anything
I don 't know what you think about MARTHAHUBER but she ruins people 's lives . . . just for fun
she ruined my family
It 's nothing to do with her
I do not understand
go
Remember the first time we tested you and your potassium level was a little high
Yes, you want me to stop eating bananas
But we continued to do tests, and it continued to rise
We 've done the whole set of tests now your kidney function is intact
must be in something you eat
let me see
These numbers can 't be right
Who prepares your meal ?
B R E E .
I understand you have some marital problems
etc- -
Wasn 't there a salad incident?
She put onions when she knew you were allergic
it was just an accident
The potassium in your body must come from somewhere
go out
R E X   - -
seriously
go out
leave the chart
I want to see
How are you doing today?
In fact, very good
Hahahaha I probably had the best day in a long time
Look, I 'm not asking you to resign
no
no no no
No you just TMD guaranteed me not going anywhere in the next 20 years
I do not know what to say
I heard the phrase 'please forgive me' is very popular
yes i 'm sorry i 'm sorry i 'm sorry
i don 't wanna hurt you
I just want to protect our family
If you get promoted, we 'll never see you again
you will travel all day
LYNETTELYNETTELYNETTE you are right
You 're right
You 're right, that promotion would destroy us so it 's better
What 's the meaning ?
That means I can rest
oh yes
I think you 'll be fine for a while
No, not for a while, but from now on
I 'm going to be a stay-at-home dad
what ?
Ah what? It 's up to you to make money for the time being
TOM , this is really . . . . . . crazy
Why? why this is crazy
You and I both know that you 're pretty good in advertising and you keep telling me how hard it is to be a mom
Yes, it 's hard work, but I love it and I 've been doing it for 6 years and I 'm not complaining all the time
fair enough
Fair enough, but honestly . . .
Behind the scenes . . . you miss the advertising world, don 't you?
I mean, you miss those pressures and deadlines and that -- that passionate lunch
Did I said wrong thing ?
Maybe-- maybe? Want to clean up those dirty socks so that?
We 're talking about this seriously before we make rash decisions
I have made a decision
? To return to work
At least I can get you something to eat, ZACH?
Then get a bottle of soda, thank you

I want to say, I think you 're doing something wrong
Mike won 't kill anyone
I mean . . . it might just be a misunderstanding
It 's not a misunderstanding. Listen, I know you 're troubled
But these are true What do you think your mom wants you to do? Maybe don 't let me do it
very true
Because she wants you to grow up normally, you 've been through too much
you lost your mother
You still have the guilt of what happened to your sister--
I never had a sister
Honey, I know about DANA
Why are you so stupid?
I am DANA
my mom takes in some homeless people
They adopted me and changed my name
They 've lied to my whole life
Everyone is lying to me!
My mom, my dad Ms. TILMAN, and even JULIE
Do you understand how hurtful that is?!
Look, ZACH . . .
I know you 're upset right now
Let 's just-- just sit down and talk
Why?! That? Can you lie to me too?!
don 't say anymore hello ?
BREE , I am DR .
CRAIG . I  ' MATTHEHOSPITAL , I am in the hospital
ANDI ' MAFRAIDIHAVESOMEBADNE WS . I 'm afraid I have some bad news
O H ?
REX died ten minutes ago
But his surgery -- not until tomorrow morning
I know. It 's just that he hasn 't started doing it yet
I am very sorry. We tried our best
B R E E
Yes, of course you tried your best
thank you very much for your call
It 's been a long way behind my back You can do what you want
you still have some time to go
Are you sure you know what you are doing?
Have you really killed someone before?
Of course
OH.
Until you 're really tired of walking, let 's get things sorted out here
Actually I don 't expect you to approve
But at least you have to be polite to me and tell me why we are here?
you know DIERDRE
Yes
And I know what you did to her
She 's just a sad girl with a lot of problems she 's got some trouble, some crazy, selfish BUTYOUTELLME but you tell me
What did she do to incur death?
Incur the evil hands of people like you
this thing is complicated
It 's, um. . . as complicated as they say
My husband has shared my secret . . .
Would you like to have some red Luo, ZACHARY?
The secret is to protect I 'm dead
put it here
We had to fence the backyard before the pool was finished
I know
I am serious
? Be aware that children can easily fall into the water
hello ANGELA
? Have a good job that hides your whereabouts
I 've spent a lot of my father 's money looking for you
Congratulations you found us
? Know that I never told the police what happened
don 't you?
They 'll take DANA away to nurse--
Or worse give him to my father so I kept our little secret
Well . . . we appreciate it
Anyway, I guess you can see that I 'm reformed
yes you are cute
I 'm not the same person coming back here ANGELA
I live in a nice place now
? Can 't take him
Just because I didn 't tell the police before
doesn 't mean now i can 't do it
ZACH is our son
his name is Dana
is he not?
- please calm down - you guys are always so puffed up like you 're back in the hospital
Looking down on our poor degenerate pretend you wanna help when you really wanna feel noble
? is a self-righteous bitch
You always do, don 't you? Go to hell
what are you doing? show me your arm
- I said I changed it! - Calm down let 's all calm down
? What are you going to do there?
i 'm looking for my baby i 'm taking him home
PAUL , stop her
DEIRDRE, contract
Sit down and take your hands off !
we nurtured him we were his parents
come on
- Ah! - PAUL!
do not worry
I will give him a warm home
Do not !
哦 ,   M A R Y   A L I C E . . .
What have you done?
mother ?
It 's okay, Zach
Mom wants to borrow your toy box
you go to sleep, okay?
what should we do ?
Did you mention they 're cementing the swimming pool tomorrow?
are you kidding me
They 'll never find her we put her in here
she can 't get in
Then we 're going to put her in
What are you doing? Look for traces of injections
DEIRDRE has a child ?
Hurry up, stop this
Looking back and staring at the world staring at these people behind me makes me feel so strange that everyone is so brave and determined
But so desperate
Desperately wanting to go out to work
But I 'm not willing to lose something because I go out and work together
Desperate to get everything you want
Even if she doesn 't know what she wants
Desperate to make life perfect
Although she realizes that life is never perfect
Desperate for a better future
There is a way to get rid of her past
I 'm not just watching, I 'm cheering for these amazing women
I really hope they all get what they want but I know that not all of them are happy - = Eden Forum http://www.ydy.com=- Honors- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Subtitles in this forum are only for translation and learning purposes.
