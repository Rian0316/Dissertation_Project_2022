I didn 't order a cake, you take it back to the cake shop

(Said it was sent by Mindy to you)



I 'll put cake in your ass
Mindy called me




- what is this? What about Mindy? - I just handed things over to you as instructed
- Mindy called you here? - no
- Just now you said 'Minty' - they asked me to say that



give me in

What do you mean? Did Mindy order the cake?

- I don 't know, they ordered it - they? Who are you calling them?


- There 's a group of people - who are they?
the person on the phone
They asked me to bring the cake and it was sent to my phone
- I 'll do as they say - Calm down
Breathe through your nose . . . okay?
Great, show me what their message says
- show me the content - ok, here it is
- I should. . .
- Shut up and give it to me


How is this going?

They passed on to me and I did as they instructed
Why? Why are you doing this?


Is it them?

( can I go now? )


( no)
(Take a photo for him)



- The other person asked me to take a photo- God

Okay. . .
The other party wants us to follow their orders
Then everything will be fine, okay? damn

They say we want to work together
- What are we going to do? - Deliver the cake somewhere
The other party sends the address, map coordinates, etc.
- We 're going to drive a car - a car? what kind of car?

I don 't know, the other party just said the car was parked outside
Just pass me the license plate, that 's all I know
Why should we both be together?

Let me put on my shoes first, okay?
(follow him with the package)
What did the other party say?
They said: 'Take the package and follow him'
Okay

Well, the other party said the key is in the back. . . Found it






Listen, maybe it 's up to you to drive. Can you drive?
- I just had a drink - I can 't . . . I can drive
But still studying, failed the exam
Okay
you are responsible for the navigation
Do you have navigation software in your phone?
have
Here, enter this location
On a suburban street, it should be in the town of High Wycombe
The other party wants us to arrive at 2 o 'clock, and we are in a hurry

I guess they should have a handle on you so they can threaten you?

My secret is . . .
Did you see lace panties in my house?
I was waiting for a prostitute
Call girls, prostitutes, whatever you call them
I 'm a family guy and that 's fine
just life is boring
When I was young, I would... .
I don 't get it either, I just want girls in their twenties
I should miss the past, I don 't know
I joined this site out of curiosity just to see what 's in there
I chat with Mindy, at least I think her name is Mindy

She sent me pictures, and I sent back a few
A photo taken with a cell phone, holding my lower body
All kinds of pornographic photos, now it 's all in their hands
Not only the photos, but the agreed place and time of the chat
And the other side of the conversation I bargained with said it was all in their hands
All information is stored on the hard disk, just like auditing
Damn, damn, I 'm such an idiot
If this scandal spreads, my wife will definitely leave the house
And the baby, she 'll take it
I 'm sure she 'll take the baby and win the case
win custody
I don 't want to lose the baby, I tell you
impossible, absolutely impossible


they filmed me
- Candid filming of you . . .
- Through the camera lens of my computer
- What are they filming you for? - You know, filming me doing that kind of thing
- Sex? - No, you know
Handjob? Handjobs like watching porn?
everyone does it

- Even the Pope - they 're going to pass on the video
to everyone around me
- Damn, asshole - what? What 's wrong?
- How long has that beacon been? - what lights
Whose car it is, this car is out of gas


soon
Unleaded gasoline. . .
hateful

We all have the same capitalization

Just asked poor Hector to help with the guessing night meal
Usually a mess
I have to hurry up and take this kid to the station
His train is coming . . . we should go
- Going to Cans Road Station? - right
Can you drop me a ride?
Will it pass through Mayer Street anyway?
You can get there by bus, but usually take a detour
- Actually, we were in a hurry.
I 'll just jump out of the car and you don 't need to slow down, okay?


- ok, no problem, let 's go - great, thanks
i sit in the back seat



Be careful not to crush the box

How is Penny doing? The last time I saw her seemed to be on sports day

she 's fine
- Is she still planning to go back to work? - right. . .


(We see where you are) (Wrong direction)
- How old is Taeo? - seven years old
(We see where you are)
He 's so funny in the play, wearing a big hat
That 's right, he 's having fun (you 're going in the wrong direction)
By the way, Anna is having a pajama party.
Casey should have mentioned it to you
With six nine-year-old girls at home, I must be crazy
(Three unread, turn back)



Kenny, where are you going?


- Sorry, what did you say? - are you going home or . . .

- He 's taking the train to Birmingham- yeah

(arrive within 20 minutes)
I grew up elsewhere, in London I grew up in London
(otherwise pass it on)
Are your parents Hector 's family or Penny 's family?



someone is going to cross the road . . .


Sorry, he has to get on the train

(About 9.5 km, arrives in 5 minutes)


we 'll catch up, don 't worry
under this channel
- what? Is it this one? - Exactly. . .




Are you sure it 's here?
'Look what 's in the cake'
Let 's see what 's in the cake

look inside the cake
should mean inside

i touched it

What is this for?


my god




- 'Give you 5 minutes to decide' - decide what?

- 'Who is the driver' - 'Who is the robber'
(Union Bank)


- we can not. . .
- I 'm a driver
Just now you said you can 't drive, I 'll be the driver
I 'm right here, the car won 't turn off
we can 't do that . . .
So how do we handle this? Kenny - I don 't do . . .
- listen to me - i don 't do it . . .
- shut up and listen to me
Put on your hat and sunglasses, no one will recognize you
- You could be Kevin Bacon, this is the first point - I . . .
Shut up, the second point staff are all trained in robbery
- I do not want it. . .
- All trained to hand over cash
No need to quarrel, I 've seen in the documentary that the other party won 't resist, it seems easy
not easy at all
I know it 's not easy but what options do we have?
If this gets out, I will lose my child
i can swear to god
If it comes true I 'll stand in the kitchen and stab my neck with a bread knife
- I was just looking at the pictures . . .
- Handjob to the camera? They only have this handle?
Your handsome face, fuzzy hands, and radiant bodily fluids?

If you put it on social networking sites, your mother will be very happy
Your friends will watch you do this
Female colleagues in the workplace will call you a pervert porno
Make fun of your orgasm and use the photo as your desktop background
Not just weeks, but years
Those pictures put on search engines like a gypsy curse
And the internet has no antidote, it will never go away
It will ruin your reputation, it will be an indelible stain
If it were me, I 'd hang myself and break my neck if I had a chance

They just want money so go in and grab it
- you 'll drive away - I won 't drive away
I 'll stay here, the car won 't turn off



I can 't do it . . .
- you can do it . . .
- I can 't do it . . .
- you can - i can 't
We 're running out of time, Kenny


- it 's not true . . .
- you can do it


cheer up, please calm down
- To shut up. . .
- Okay

do you have a bag?
And glasses, breathe through your nose



hand over the money



hand over the money
- Got it, all right- a lot of money, I want a lot of money
Want to use your bag?



I 'm going to give you the money, okay?



Someone just stood there with a cell phone and scared me half to death
- Did you get the money? - got it




faster
The speed limit is 65km Do you want to be stopped by the police for speeding?


- Terrible- Damn




is the police


- go quickly - shut up

wait a minute . . .
hurry up
be ready soon



we 're all right
To pass the message on to them? Tell them we got the money



- The other party said to send the money somewhere - where?



right here
That 's right

bring it on
'Final Instruction'

'drive away and destroy'

to destroy this car
'You handle it alone'
Why only you handle it?
(An unread letter, bring the money to the designated location)
(Two unread, you go alone)

i have to send the money there
Why? Why am I responsible for sending money?
who knows
(Three unread, act now)
so. . .
You better hurry up, right?
you 've been holding on for so long
Just take the money and it 's over, you 'll be fine


Kenny, listen to me, I 'm sorry about what happened just now
I yelled at you, scolded you
I 'm actually a good guy, I swear if the situation... . .
when things are normal
take care, okay?



ok . . . . . . . . .

The other party asked me to start the drone first



Okay
Did you bring the bonus?
- bonus? - bonuses for fights

How could there be a fight?
- They didn 't tell you? - no
We 're going to fight or they 'll blow things out
winner can take the money


we have to fight
I mean they 're looking at us

What are the rules? How do we know when it 's over?
How to judge winning or losing?
I don 't know your situation, but if it spreads, my life will be ruined
completely ruined



What do you have in their hands?

I just looked at the pictures and I saw one or two pictures
Yes
yeah . . . i just looked at the pictures too

How old is the person in the photo?
How young are you?


That 's right
Me too
(open now)
(until one party dies)



dude . . . don 't do that, please
please
please
