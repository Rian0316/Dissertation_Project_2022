Somewhere out of town near High Wycombe
They made us arrive before two o 'clock on a tight schedule

They must have some handle on you
Threats to publish it

As for what I am... .
You also saw that room with lace panties
I 'm actually waiting for a whore
Call girls now have various names
I have a family that 's fine
people get bored sometimes
I liked when I was young . . .
I can 't justify myself
I just wanna fuck a young girl in her 20s
To commemorate the past, I can 't tell
I signed up for a website and I am curious
Just wanted to see what 's up there
I talked to Mindy at least I thought her name was Mindy

She sent me some pictures and I responded with some
Phone selfie holding my own dick
Everything you can think of, they 've got it all
Not only photo chat history including all the time and place etc.
I haggled there and they said they got it all
Drain all the information from the hard drive like an auditor
Damn bastard I 'm such a big idiot
If that information leaks out my wife will leave me
She 'll take the kids too
I have no doubt that she will take them
And she 'll win the case
she will get custody
I told you I must never lose my children
no no absolutely no

they photographed me
- photographed you . . . - via my computer camera
- photographed you what - yes it is
do that
- Have sex? - No way. . . .
You know
Do you jerk off to watch porn?

Everybody does it

The goddamn pope probably does that too.
they 're going to send it around
to send to everyone

- how long has the light been on - what light

'5 Minute Decision' to decide what

- 'who drives' - 'who robs'
National Union Bank


no no
- we can 't we . . . - I drive

You say you can 't drive then I 'll drive
I 'm just here waiting for it to turn off

we can 't we . . .
So what are we going to do Kenny - I won 't . . . - listen to me
- I won 't . . . - shut up and listen

No one can recognize you with a hat and sunglasses
you could be anyone this is the first point
Shut up, point 2, bank staff trained when robbery happens

I will not. . .
They are trained to hand over cash
No resistance I 've seen it in the documentary There will be no resistance It seems simple
it 's not easy
I know it 's not easy
But what else can we do
If this leaks out I will lose my baby
I swear to god if that ever happened
I 'll be in the kitchen looking for a bread cutter to pierce my throat
I just looked at some pictures . . .
Then there was a plane shot under the camera and they all filmed it, right?
Your hot little face and fuzzy fists come all over the place

Your mom will be so happy it 's on Facebook
What else is there on twitter and her friends on twitter, everyone will see you doing that
Plus the unit 's dead bastard calls you 'Squirt Little Prince'
laugh at your orgasm and make it your computer desktop
It 's not a matter of a few weeks and no one will forget it for years
A photo can be searched on Google like the curse of the gypsies
Things on the Internet can 't be fixed and will never go away
It 'll be forever stained with your name
If that happened to me I would kill myself
Break my neck at every chance

They just want money so go in and do it
- you 'll drive away - i won 't do that
I 'll sit here and the car won 't turn off


I can 't do it
- You can do it, you can do it - I can 't really can 't
- You can - I can 't
we 're out of time kenny



it 's not real it 's not real
what you can do


hold on to the perk point
shut up shut up shut up shut up
All right


do you have a bag
glasses breathing through the nose



give me money



give me money
Okay
i want a lot of money
can i use your bag



can i give it back to you now



There 's a guy standing over there on the phone and freaking me out
- did you get it - yes




drive faster
Speed ​​limit 4 0 Do you want to be caught speeding


- shit- fuck
wait here when the red light is on


There are sirens
Do not talk
wait here when the red light is on
- let 's go - shut up

etc
quick
good soon



we 're all right
We should text them and tell them we got the money



- they say we have to send the money somewhere - what



right here
Yes

coming
'Final Instructions'
'Drive the car away and destroy it'
destroy the car
'You do it yourself'
why yourself
send the money to that point
go by oneself

I have to send the money over there
why why should i go
who the fuck knows
go immediately
So. . .
you better go, right?
You 've come this far, haven 't you?
Just put it there and you 're done
you 'll be fine


listen to me kenny
what happened just now . . . i 'm sorry
Yelling at you and swearing at you
I 'm actually not a bad person I swear as long as...
everything is normal
are you taking care



wait a minute

They told me I gotta let it fly first



All right
did you get the bonus
- What is the bonus - for the duel

duel
- didn 't they tell you - no we have to duel

Otherwise, they will publish all the materials they have.
Winner gets bonus


we have to do this
I mean
what are they looking at

What kind of duel do we know when it 's over?
How is it a win?
I don 't know what 's your situation

If mine leaks, it 's over
I 'm fucking done



What did they get hold of you?

I just saw a few pictures
Nothing else, I just looked at a picture or two
Yes
Well, I just saw a few pictures

How old is the person in the photo
Many


That 's right
Me too
let 's play
let 's play
beat to death



listen buddy don 't beg you like that
I beg you
I beg you
