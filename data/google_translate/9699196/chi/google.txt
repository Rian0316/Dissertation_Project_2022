‎Wait!
‎ You don 't come to the window anymore
‎ Yes
‎ Where did I go wrong?
‎ You 've been bullying me Adam for years
‎ You 've made me feel insecure for years
‎ I used to not be able to treat myself well‎ You are one of the main reasons
‎ Should I believe you suddenly changed?
‎ You 've filled me with shame buddy‎ I can 't go on like this
‎ I have a hard time learning to love myself

‎ And I like Maeve
‎ Compared to Euler‎ I prefer Maeve
‎ - Otis . . . down. . . ‎ - but I want to be a good boyfriend
‎ So I said to Maeve: ‎ 'I 'm sorry but I can 't see you again'
‎ Then Euler dumped me
‎ hmmm confusing i 'm confused
‎ But I thought ‎ Maybe it 's a good thing because . . .
‎ I really want to be with Maeve
‎ I didn 't really want to be with Euler‎ Then I realized
‎ Maeve Wiley just loves to play with other people 's feelings‎ She doesn 't care
‎ Like she brought this . . . man with him
‎ I can 't tell, maybe just to make me jealous
‎ - absolutely useless‎ - absolutely useful
‎ All in all

‎ I was eight years old
‎ My mom didn 't send me to school
‎ She was sleeping a lot
‎ I tried making my own baked bean toast
‎ My brother had to call an ambulance
‎ The beans must be hot

‎ Yes
‎ Anyway, this is my story
‎ The guy named Otis won 't understand
‎ He won 't understand this little world that doesn 't belong to him
‎ - Otis has his own family problems too ‎ - That 's different
‎ Growing up if you knew that the person who was supposed to make sure you were alive left you . . . ‎ it will leave a lot of scars
‎ But these scars make a difference
‎ You and I are different
‎ I 'm sorry I shouldn 't have said that to your mother
‎ I guess I 'm just jealous that someone came back to you
‎ - ok go to sleep ‎ - ok
‎ But wake up the neighbors

‎ Thank you for all the fun you did tonight

‎ goodbye
‎ go away
‎ A d i ó s
‎ take care



‎ hello
‎ This book is actually pretty good
‎ How was it with that boy?
‎ very boring
‎ I feel like I need to focus on myself for a while
‎ This is my daughter
‎ You are very smart and won 't chase the stupid boy around you
‎ That 's how I went astray
‎ Wait until they become men
‎ Then they will shine

‎ This advice is good mom
‎ Don 't put your shoes on the sofa
‎ ok‎ ok
‎ Where did I see?

‎ Jackson
‎ - come in‎ - sorry!
‎ I know I 'm past curfew
‎ I have to tell them

‎ Are you drunk?

‎ We talked about it
‎ What did she tell you about me?
‎ There 's nothing I don 't know
