 Why hast thou forsaken me , O deity whose existence I doubt ? Here .
 Breathe into this bag .
 What 's going on ?
 They stole everything , Leonard !
 Everything . Are you the roommate ?
 Yeah , Leonard Hofstadter .
 What happened ?
 Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery .
 Oh , my God , what did they get ?
 What didn 't they get ?
 They got my enchanted weapons , my vicious gladiator armor , my wand of untainted power , and all my gold !

 You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account ?
 What choice did I have ?
 The mighty Sheldor , level 85 blood elf , hero of the Eastern kingdoms , has been picked clean , like a carcass in the desert sun .
 Plus , the FBI hung up on me .
 Into the bag .
 They took my battle ostrich !
 Oh , no , not Glenn ! Yes !
 Glenn !
 The only bird I ever loved .
 Good luck , fellas .
 Oh .
 Well , thank you , officer . Wait a minute !

 You 're not going to do anything ?
 Mr. Cooper , there 's nothing ...
 Dr. Cooper .
 Seriously ?
 Not the kind with access to drugs .
 Fine . Dr. Cooper .
 I 'm sorry for your loss , but the Pasadena Police Department doesn 't have jurisdiction in ...

 Pandora .

 World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth .
 Goodness gracious , how are you allowed to carry a gun ?
 Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex- cop ?
 What ?
 Wh ... you know , one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules , and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice ?

 No .
 Thank you , officer .

 I 'm really sorry , Sheldon .
 What kind of world do we live in , where a man would take another man 's battle ostrich ?
 I don 't know .
 This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity .
 It is time to cry havoc , and let slip the dogs of war .
 I 'm on it .

 Hi , Mrs. Wolowitz .
 Is , is Howard there ?

 Okay , thanks .
 That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath .

 See if Raj is done with Pilates .

 Three thousand hours .
 Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse , collecting weapons and gold .
 It 's almost as if it was a huge waste of time .
 Whoever did this knew what they were doing .
 He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes , transferred all your stuff , and didn 't leave a digital fingerprint .
 There isn 't enough chamomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart .

 Hold on .
 I 'm talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him , he 'll help us track down your things .
 Can we trust him ?
 I should say so ; He appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family .
 Whoa !
 Somebody 's auctioning off a jeweled ostrich bridle ! No .
 Glenn 's was leather .
 He was a simple ostrich .
 Is !
 Is , I haven 't given up hope .

 Hey . Hey , Penny .
 We 're kind of in the middle of a crisis , here . Oh , I know .
 Bernadette told me .
 Sorry , Sheldon .
 I know that game meant a lot to you .
 What ... " that game " ?
 Excuse me , Penny , but Doodle Jump is a game .
 Angry Birds is a game .
 World of Warcraft is a massively multi- player online role- playing ... all right , technically it 's a game .
 Bad news , the Nigerian prince may be a fraud .
 Okay , well , anyways , I brought you a day- old cheesecake to cheer you up !
 Stale pastry is hollow succor to a man who is bereft of ostrich .
 Just say " thank you . "
 I thought I just did . All right .
 See you later .
 Oh ! Hello .
 Oh , hi ! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon .

 He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that 's useful in a make- believe place .
 I don 't know what that means .
 Yeah , well , sadly , I do .
 Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach ?
 Can you believe that ?
 I feel like I 'm supposed to say " that bitch , " but I don 't have enough information .
 I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place .
 And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste ,
 I had to carry him to the water .
 I took Howard to the beach once .
 He almost burst into flames like a vampire .
 So what 's the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material ?
 I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend . I think you 're on .
 Oh .
 That bitch !
 Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream ?
 Ah , here 's the alcohol and drug peer pressure
 Mother warned me about .
 I was starting to think it was never going to happen .
 Yes , please .
 You guys should 've seen Leonard when I first met him . There was no eye contact .
 He was either looking up at the ceiling , or down at his shoes .
 I 'm drunk .

 You know , for the first couple of months , whenever I would take off my bra , he would giggle and say , " Oh , boy , my breast friends ! "
 Well , if it makes you feel any better , I 'm never speaking to Priya again .
 No , don 't do that .
 No reason to be mean to her .
 This may be the alcohol talking ... but I believe there is .
 Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University ?
 No , but I can name all the Kardashians .
 Primates , such as ourselves , have a natural instinct to ostracize ill- mannered members of the troop .
 Bernadette 's urge to shun , scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard- wired into her DNA .
 I don 't have an urge to fling my waste .
 Believe me , it 's there , we all have it .
 Hit me with some more booze , and I 'll show you .
 All right , here we are ... this is the tavern where all the black- market weapon trades go down .
 I don 't think my character should be in a place like this .
 Everyone 's undressing her with their eyes .
 Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up .

 Okay , what exactly are we looking for ?
 Redheaded troll , goes by the name of Glumly .
 According to the message boards , if you want to move stolen goods and it 's after school hours , he 's your guy .
 Leonard , is this going to take much longer ?
 I thought we were going to spend some time together . Uh , we are .
 In the meantime , you 're welcome to whip up a quick character and join us .
 Seriously ?
 Well , you have to put in a credit card number , but it 's fun .
 Maybe I should just go home .
 Our troll just walked in ! I got him !
 We got him . We 're almost done .
 So , how do you guys want to play this ?
 Be ruthless .
 You tell him if he doesn 't start talking , we 'll register a complaint with his Internet service provider .

 He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming .
 I don 't care ! I 'm losin ' it , man !
 Why don 't we play this smart ?
 Try a little " good goblin , bad goblin . "
 Oh , dear Lord .
 Nah , I think we have to be more subtle .
 Okay , I see where this is going .
 Fine , I 'll have sex with him .
 That 's not where it was going .
 Good , because I would hate that .
 Leonard , you 're busy ... let 's talk tomorrow .
 Oh , wait . Hang on . Are you upset ?
 No , no , I think it 's sexy to date a boy trapped in a man 's body .
 Good , good . I 'll tell you what happens .


 Well , well , well .
 Look who it is . Okay , be nice .
 Hello . Hi . We 're just heading out for a drink .
 Because I do that now .

 Count your blessings you 're not a Tanzanian chimp .
 What ?
 Don 't listen to her ... she 's had a lot of ice cream .
 Do you want to join us ?
 Oh , thank you , but I have work to do .
 Four women walk down the stairs ... how many reach the lobby ?

 Did your sister say anything when you got home last night ?
 Oh , no , don 't put me in the middle of this . I 'm not going to be your go- between .
 Come on , help me out .
 Am I in trouble ?
 There 's no reason to worry .
 That 's a relief .
 I 'm sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights
 Skyping with their ex- boyfriend Sanjay .
 Good news , gentlemen ...
 I found our hacker .
 What ? Really ? Yeah .
 No one can hide from me , not Waldo , not Carmen San Diego , not even topless Natalie Portman .


 I 've never said these words before , but good job , Howard !
 Thanks .
 Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki , 2711
 Ocean View Road ,
 Carlsbad , California .
 The name and the address drip with evil .
 What else do we know about him ? Why , quite a bit , actually .
 I 'll bet he 's some loser who lives with his parents .

 Yes , he does live with his parents .
 Here 's a Google Earth shot of their house .
 Excellent ! It 's in a cul- de- sac . We can box him in .
 Hold on , you 're thinking of going there ?
 Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away .
 Fine .
 You walk up to the house , knock on the door and demand your stuff back .
 What if he says no ?
 I don 't know if you 've been following the news , Leonard , but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture .

 No one 's getting tortured .
 Fine , we 'll abide by the Geneva Convention .
 But ask yourself this , in the course of our lives , how much lunch money has been taken from us ?
 How many kites ?
 How many Scooby- Doo Trapper Keepers ?
 I totally had one of those .
 Of course you did . It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work .
 But the bullies took it from us .
 Well , no more .
 Tonight , we take back our dignity , our birthright and our pride .
 What do you say ? Who 's with me ?


 I have a hip- hop aerobics class at 5 : 00 ; could we go after ? Sure .
 Also , tonight 's the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of

 If we could leave at 8 : 00 , we 'd still be able to regain our birthright at 10 : 00 , 10 : 30 latest .
 Fine .
 Leonard ?
 Oh , geez , I- I don 't know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row .
 Oh , come on , man .
 Bros before ...

 my sister .
 Aw , screw it .
 I 'm in .
 Me , too . And me .


 One moment .

 I 'm hell- bent on catching a cyber criminal , not the common cold .

 I 'm sorry , I thought this delay was
 I am . She 's just bleaching her mustache .

 Check it out .
 Hey , Ma !
 " Before and After ! "
 Four words , 17 letters , two N 's , one V !
 " Fanny pack of wolves ! "

 That 's incredible .

 Uh- oh , that 's Priya .
 Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool , dude .
 Hit the ...
 Hey , sweetie .
 Yeah , I 'm sorry .
 I 'm gonna be working late .
 Yeah , I- I miss you , too .
 Okay , sure , I 'll call you when I get home .
 Okay , bye- bye . Very nice .
 You lie to my sister .
 That 's the nicest thing he does to your sister .

 Oh , guess who .
 Cover for me .
 Hello , Priya .
 What 's up ?
 How would I know if Leonard 's at work or not ?
 Don 't be suspicious .
 Look , if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue , you 're going to have to believe whatever wild- eyed , cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you .

 Okay ?
 Yeah , bye- bye .
 You owe me .
 New puzzle , Ma !
 " Same name " ! One N , two D 's , three O 's !
 Whoopi and Rube Goldberg !
 That 's uncanny . I know .
 It 's her superpower .
 Well , that and jiggling her arm fat .

 I can 't believe we 're going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy .
 Yeah , we 're kind of bad- asses , aren 't we ?
 Totally .
 Hey , how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning ?
 Sea World is better .
 It has Shamu , who is literally tons of fun .
 But for the moment , let 's stay focused on Todd Zarnecki . Yeah , we 're coming for you , Todd Zarnecki .
 And for the record , Legoland is more interactive .
 I almost feel sorry for the poor fool , sitting in his split- level suburban ranch , unaware that a vengeful horde is barreling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour .

 Ease up there , lead foot .
 You trying to get us killed ?
 I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music .
 This says " Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix . "
 It 's a re- writable CD .
 Just put it in .
 Beyonce ? Really ?
 She 's curvy and she owns it .
 I like that .

 Oh , yeah , I 'm feeling it . We are winged fury !
 Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit .

 Next time we go to kick someone 's ass , we take the train .
 I always prefer the train .
 Sheldon , let 's go .
 Coming .

 Why did you bring that ?
 No weapon strikes more fear into a man 's heart than a Klingon bat 'leth .
 Okay , let 's get clear on something .
 We 're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way .
 No one 's bat 'lething anybody .
 So my blade shall not taste blood tonight ?
 No .
 Well , now I just feel silly holding it .
 Come on . Can I at least kick down the door ?
 You 're welcome to try , but the other day , it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box .

 Who is it ?
 Your doom !
 Don 't say " your doom . "
 Who opens the door for their doom ?
 Good point .
 Basket of puppies .

 What ?

 Sheldon ?

 Are you Todd Zarnecki ? Yeah . Who are you ?
 I am Sheldor of Azeroth .
 I want my things back .
 I don 't think so . Let me see that .
 Careful .
 That 's a collectible .
 I know .
 I 've always wanted one .
 Well , he 's even more cunning than we thought .
 You know , the joke 's on him .
 Without the certificate of authenticity , that bat 'leth is worthless .
 Yeah , he walked right into our trap .
 Legoland seems like a hollow dream now .

 What 's the matter ? Something 's wrong .
 I 'm not getting any gas .


 Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines ? Of course . 19th- century technology .
 Very basic .
 Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine ?
 No . No . Not a clue .
 Well , we 'd better call somebody to come pick us up .
 It 'd be swell if they had a train .

 Thank you , Penny .
 No problem .
 So , Leonard ,
 I think it 's interesting you didn 't call your girlfriend to come get you .
 Uh , I kind of told her I was working .
 So you lied to her .
 Also interesting .
 Yeah , she doesn 't really understand the whole Warcraft adventure- role- playing thing .
 Well , doesn 't matter if she gets it , as long as she 's pretty .
 This one 's funny , Leonard .
 How come you couldn 't make it work with her ?
 So did you at least get Sheldon 's fake stuff back ?
 No . We failed in our noble quest .

 How come ?
 Todd Zarnecki was mean .
 All right . Hang on .
 What are you doing ?
 I 'm gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska .
 Oh .
 Beyonce .

 This ain 't no Beyonce .

 Now what ?
 Give my friend his stuff back .
 I don 't know what you 're talking about .
 Well , then , good news .
 Today 's the day a girl 's finally going to touch you in your little special place .

 Now give him his stuff back . Okay .
 We did it !
 I said , " we . "
 Oh , hold the door .
 Oh , hi . Hi .
 Going to see Leonard ?
 Yes .
 How have you been ?
 Fine .
 You ?
 Very well , thank you .
