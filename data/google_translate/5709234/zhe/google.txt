Many years ago in the early 20th century, M anyyearsago, I 'mtalkingearly 20thcentury, most soldiers didn 't even shoot mostsoldiersdidn 'tevenfiretheirweapons.

The brigadier general walked the line with a stick. The brigadier, he  'dwalk the linewithastic k he would whip his soldiers to shoot and he  ' dwhackhismeninorderto getthemtoshoot.
Even in World War II when E venin W orld War II , inafirefight , only 1 5 % to 2 0 % of people would shoot only 1 5 % , 2 0 % ofthemenwouldpullthet rigger .
The fate of the world hangs by a thread. Only 15% of the world atsta ke shot and only 15% ofthemfired.
