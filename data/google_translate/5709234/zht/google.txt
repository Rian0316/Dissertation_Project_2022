wake up everyone
Get up Streep



Are you awake - certainly not dreaming - collection
What happened to the village last night?
a village about three miles east of here
Reports say someone broke into a food barn and stole things

Locals think it 's a cockroach
Cockroaches set off in five minutes
it seems
You 're about to hit a cockroach with a real gun for the first time.

I asked Streep to give you a little advice in case you have a head-to-head encounter with a cockroach for the first time today.

If one were so close to you
Don 't be scared to pee your pants
That just irritates them - I try to - try to ignore Lena

He 's so bad, he 's the only one in the world
Can pee pants and spill out
- go to your village girl - village girl
Yeah hunting is my innate ability
some people are gifted
Set off





ok you can talk now





Must be cockroaches
Cockroaches, you see them
did you see it

i didn 't see i heard
It 's a mess here
they must have done it
craving cookies

- for you - they touched the food

we have to destroy everything that 's left
no one will eat

We can get you a replacement


They destroyed the cooler, disassembled it and took the parts
cooler they stole cooler parts

where did they go


The footprints in the soil went there
Pan Heideko


Pan Heideko
Is Heidekana 's last name?


Don 't let them come again and beg you to stop them
Okay

my kids are scared
i will i promise



Streep


our friends think
The cockroaches went to Pan Heideko 's house.
He 's the local religious eccentric Anderson Hagrid
stay here and help them burn the food
Let them calm and tell them to rest assured that the rest of the people visit Hedeco

Ask a few questions and do a search if there are cockroaches let them know we 're ready to go

Someone complained about him months ago
Locals say he let cockroaches through his turf
leave them food
Or maybe it 's just local villagers talking nonsense so...



How many cockroaches are left
Thousands or hundreds
How many millions are there in my hometown?
They 're back in just two years
And here are the hillbillies who give them leftovers
No wonder it took so long to destroy them
But how could anyone be stupid enough to help cockroaches?

If you look at the group view, you can see the structure diagram.

Akinwal, Konkoch, you go and search the outhouse.
Every time you search for a room, take your time
Streepleyman, you are with me and leonard
we go in from here
Lena and I go talk to Heideco about the rest of your house search.
Okay



The ideal result is not to shoot
Except for cockroaches
Except for cockroaches






Good morning, Sir
No need I speak your language
Okay
- what do you want to do - just want to talk
aren 't we talking
Let 's go in and talk more cordially

Check upstairs room



Relax I 'm not your enemy

where are they
who is where

There is a group in the village
scared and angry man
Cockroaches broke into the food bin
stolen supplies
do you know

Do not
It 's not just about stealing

The rest of the food must also be destroyed
- No one will eat it - Streep makes it worse for everyone

With a cross on the wall, you have principles
You think all life is sacred I understand
I agree that all life is sacred
So you have to protect even the cockroaches, right?
It 's not their fault they did that
not what they think


I understand we all understand



They have bad things in their blood to be like that They carry diseases
Sickness doesn 't care about the sanctity of life and who else has to suffer If it 's within five, ten, twenty years
Can 't get rid of cockroaches
There will be children born like that
Then they will reproduce



Found this endless cycle of pain
The disease could have been avoided
Damn cockroach nest



You go search there and I check the stairs for every cockroach you saved today
God knows how many people will suffer and despair tomorrow
You can 't treat them like people
I can understand your emotions but it 's wrong
Humans still want to survive
we gotta get rid of them
that is the truth
sacrifices must be made







what to do








give me a hand





Hold











* even humiliate me *
*I still care about you* *Walk around with you* *Even if I belittle me*

*I 'm still waiting for you too*
Xiao Lai
Please let 's listen all the way back to the base
Does Mr. Sunday School recite the scriptures?
Just plug your ears
ok or i press mute forever
put down the gun


Killing a cockroach sympathizer counts as one kill, right?
he is a civilian
you kill civilians
will have a lifelong uneasy conscience, Streep
can you stop being so prudish
'Cause I 'm kidding he 's not you
Looks like you both believed it, didn 't you?
All right
burn here


Are you OK
fine




- I heard you killed one- two
slow two

I solved one with a knife
oh my god
- Pretty cool. - Yeah, you Terminator
God, he killed two on the first mission
you lucky bastard

This bastard has a dream
Happy tonight





I love you









Miss Sharpshooter
disrespectful bastard

Ryman Overall Accuracy
ruthless you are the god of death
I won 't let the cockroaches run away next time
you 're still upset about that
I 've been tracking deer since I was a kid, never giving up halfway
I hate the feeling of being run away by them Ryman Overall Accuracy
awesome
If the beast ran into the forest
May escape to the border and disappear completely
nothing to you
you killed two
But I haven 't had it in a long time
This girl is worried
Come on, Lai
Did you sleep well last night

hmm okay
Is it just that?
If I kill two at a time
I would like to have an hour orgasm
ok shut up

All right
Overall Knininger Accuracy
That 's it

Overall Knininger Accuracy

are you all right mate
It 's okay, I might be tired
Looks like you had a great time last night




firm and pure
firm and pure



- Streep, are you all right? - All right


I can 't tell

I feel something is wrong
Not sick or anything but...
report to the infirmary


Diagnose
What do you see
a cube
- Are you spinning? - Yes


- now - a tree
- like an apple tree - click on those apples


all hit
do you mean you have a headache
yes but for a short time
Not serious just . . . everything looks ok
Your groupview implant shows no signs of malfunctioning or dropped calls
Physically you are in very good shape
You might have some side effects when you 're just out of a fight at the farmhouse

there 's something that glows

- by the cockroaches - by the cockroaches
- like a flashlight - the flashlight is like


I am not sure as well
Seriously, you 're alright
Blood fluid normal
All right

Maybe you should talk to Arquette
Who is Arquette


You are Kninanshe
koniango everybody calls me streep
why do they call you that
I think it 's hard to pronounce 'Keninanga'

- you 're so funny - thank you
Take a break, baby, sit down


You recently got your first kill
two cockroaches
It 's the first time it 's been working
probably


talk about
what about the kill?
in a farmhouse
There 's a secret room or something
We went in and found them inside
The first is the conditioned reflex to kill with one shot.

Well it 's like training
yes like that


- The second one - he 's tangled with me on the ground
he is a man

So it 's a short fight
Struggling to keep him on top of me
I can 't reach my rifle but stab him
stab it, stab it
How do you feel about this . . .
- what it feels like - emotional

no feelings
It 's all coming so fast I 'm just defending myself
I guess I just feel relieved
It 's normal to just breathe a sigh of relief and have other feelings
even a moment of joy
Probably
i don 't know i thought maybe i would . . .
I can 't tell - do you feel anything else - like like . . .
Regret
something but i don 't feel that way

So again you 'll do it

Of course
then why are you here
I have no idea
i don 't feel well
There seems to be something wrong with my groupview
But your implant passed all diagnoses
- it 's no problem - well they say no problem
I can 't say well either I just...


think it 's wrong
but no problem
Yes

you did a great job
you should be proud
ok
it will be pass away
sleep well tonight
have a good sleep


fuck me
















you are clumsy
It seems that Heideke did not have a long trial.

They all recruited him and said a stronghold.
where cockroaches are looking for food
Well
It 's a residential complex that 's been vacant since the war.
not far from here
Control wants us to scout there before returning to base.
can you hurry


We should really burn the whole forest, right?
Let those cockroaches have nowhere to run



ok see that
That solar panel is cleaner than the others
some cables
Must be cockroaches stealing electricity
why here
God knows

All right
i have to report




Control I 'm Medina Confirmed there are signs of activity in the cockroach housing complex

Seems to have been cleaned recently and some cables

- Are you all right? - Smell the grass

we don 't usually smell anything
- Have you ever noticed - never noticed that
Request for action plan
I didn 't understand, please repeat

Control told us to retreat and wait for the letter . . .
Oh shit

Medina

Xiao Lai Xiao Lai fast

- sober up - no






Are you guys okay

hurry up




Hold

Give
I do not need


you can see me for real

Of course I can see you
Didn 't you see cockroaches?
you are not a cockroach
Cockroaches are very...
isn 't it normal?
Cockroaches can 't talk

you just can 't hear us
what are you talking about
your implants your army implants crowd vision system
They put it in your head to help you fight
it will make you see us differently
One of us named Luca
is making a machine
capable of flashing it is said to interfere with your implants
you are a cockroach

But I 've seen cockroaches
I 've seen them they 're like... .
- animals - not monsters I 've seen them
That 's what the implants let you see




fuck the villagers

locals they are not soldiers
There 's no crowd-view in their heads
but they are afraid of cockroaches
- they hate that stuff - everybody hates us that what they see

What kind of cockroaches did those civilians see?
is what you see now
They still hate us because they 've been so brainwashed



It all started ten years ago after the war with DNA screening
Followed by registration of emergency measures
Soon everyone is calling us filthy brutes
all media tv computer
They say we are sick
Problems with our blood
They say our blood can 't last
we can 't survive

My name was Katarina
he is alec
Now we 're just cockroaches


but now
now you see me

now you see me



Xiao Lai

not good



give me a reason not to kill you
Not really Xiao Lai
what 's wrong with you

neither is true

go to hell
get up against the wall


stand up
do you want me in
It 's okay, I can just talk to him like this

thanks brilly



Streep
we owe you an apology
We couldn 't find a fault with your crowdview implant
I brought you a cup of coffee

Equipment you find in a farmhouse
The one you mentioned to the doctor

Is it this one
We also found it in the old neighborhood that you and Ryman searched
Looks like it was reverse engineered from some parts of our drone

Here the light can send a code
Like a virus invading your crowdview implant trying to shut it down from the inside
let me tell you
These Cockroaches Are More Creative Than We Think
The whole thing is a lie
I understand why you say that
cockroach
They look just like us
Of course

That 's why they 're dangerous
But we are a truly compassionate species
We don 't really want to kill each other and that 's a good thing
But not when you want to destroy your enemies to secure your future
come and sit down

I don 't know how much history you learned in school
Many years ago in the early 20th century most soldiers didn 't even fire a gun
Or even shoot
They also just shoot empty guns at the enemy 's head
they do it on purpose
British Army in World War I
The brigadier general walks the line with a stick and he beats his soldiers to shoot
Even in World War II, only 15% to 20% of people would shoot
The fate of the world hangs by a thread
Only 15% of people shoot what this tells you what this tells me
The war could have ended sooner
If the army could cheer up then

So we made improvements, more efficient training, better tuning
Then the Vietnam War broke out
Fire percentage increased to 85%
A hail of bullets but the kill rate is still low
And most of the soldiers who really killed people had psychological problems after returning.
It wasn 't until the birth of groupview that there was a turning point
Group vision
is the ultimate military weapon
provide you with information
Aim at the target for communication, adjust the mentality
If you aim at a monster
It 's much easier to shoot, right?
not only visual
Control your other senses
you can 't hear the scream
no smell of blood
they are all human
Do you know what 's in their DNA?
high cancer rate
Muscular Dystrophy Multiple Sclerosis
mental retardation syndrome
abnormal criminal tendency
It 's all screened there.
Do you want the next generation to be like this?
Don 't feel bad for doing your duty
The villagers can 't do it
People in the country can 't do it
they don 't have crowdview
It 's the group view that lets you do it
you
you are protecting the bloodline
And it 's an honor my friend
no glory at all
just kill
- Lies and Kills - No one lied to you
you always knew
what are you saying
You agreed to implant crowdview
Accept settings are the same for every soldier
We can 't just implant it to project a dream
Your brain will reject
you have to accept
that 's what you do




have you read the terms and conditions
that 's long
what is this
Your licensed video was taken when you signed the contract six months ago
Basically it means that you agree to implant crowdview and activate

- I didn 't do this - you did
- like hypnosis - okay
You will also agree that you will not know
in this state
understand? you don 't recall this conversation
kinda funny dude
turn off
To confirm authorization
- off - please press your fingerprint there
- here - yes please

pretty fun

i didn 't do that

- I don 't remember - as he said

- I know you 're pissed - fuck your mother


what happened
We control what you see Streep
- I can 't see anything - because we turned it off

get my eyes back to normal
Let me tell you about your choice
get my eyes back to normal
listen to me about your choice
Option 1 agree to reset your groupview
All the memories of these days
Including this conversation will be erased
impossible
Option two is imprisonment
- I suggest you think about it- Go to your mom groupview is your friend
without it
You will remember everything you did
I don 't want this crap
never again
Okay

So
Maybe it 's time for you to see life without group viewing


what happened

where am I
Heideco Farm three days ago


I recorded Streep
We can show everything you 've done






no no
please don 't shoot
please don 't shoot
- please, please - no no
don 't stop
don 't beg you
stop begging you


no no



Do not






fuck off

Do not
you will see
feel everything
do you want this
Locked in a cell alone, keeps recirculating this memory





we can erase it for you
This conversation is also
everything
but you have to agree

as long as you agree with Streep
everything will be erased

as long as you agree
Welcome home
