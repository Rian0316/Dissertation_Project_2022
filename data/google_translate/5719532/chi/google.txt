Gym Member Kimberly Wexler



Ken Kitatani
hello gold

Of course Ernie
What 's up
mr mcgill fired me
- what happened - i don 't . . .
It does not matter
I am. . .
how is jimmy
I feel bad like my fault
I didn 't expect it to be like this
what 's wrong with jimmy





- McGill? - Yes



it 's your turn



Now is the case CR - 2 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 8 1

James McGill
Yes Your Honor
Usually you are not like this
Mr. McGill
I don 't want this either
you went through a lot yesterday
OK
Mr. McGill, you are charged with a fourth-degree felony charge of forcibly breaking into another 's home.
Eighteen months in prison, $5,000 fine and misdemeanor assault
Up to six months in prison and a $500 fine
There is also a misdemeanor criminal damage to property punishable by up to six months in prison and a $500 fine
The victim is . . .
your brother charles
Really
I think this is the time for you to file a defense
Yes Your Honor
I want to plead not guilty
Court approves defendant 's plea of ​​not guilty
mr mcgill do you have a lawyer now
There Judge Kim Wexler
I will represent Mr. McGill in this case
very timely
Please put Ms. Wexler on the record as attorney for the defendant
Your Honor, I want to represent myself
I strongly advise against it Mr McGill
You know what others say about those who represent themselves
I know but as you know
I have defended people in multiple criminal cases
Your Honor, can I talk to my client?
It doesn 't look like he 's your client

Mr. McGill, would you like to meet this
Can you talk to someone who could be your lawyer?
No, Your Honor, I have made up my mind
- I want to represent myself - Your Honor . . .
He is not your client, Ms. Wexler
I 'm sorry I have to go to the next step
The two of you can work this out privately.
I 'm sorry I was going to call you but I think I should tell you in person
Mr. McGill
Let 's take a look at the bail issue
You have no prior convictions and no arrest warrants
where are you currently working as a lawyer
I haven 't seen you in court in a while
old age law
very noble
Hope you can get back to your old business soon
Consider your rapport with the community
I see no reason to refuse bail I set bail at $2,500





i screwed up
Chuck played me again
that tape
Did he let Ernie hear it on purpose?
Because he knew Ernie . . . didn 't say he meant to tell me about it I 'd go to his house and try to destroy the tape or steal it or something
Howard is there and there 's a private detective waiting for me
Lost my mind, ran into the house, Chuck made me go round and round
And I was so stupid to fall into his trap
idiot

I 'm very sorry
I 'm so stupid that I didn 't call you and I 'm sorry
But there 's a reason I didn 't call you
 'Cause it 's my mess
is it my fault
I 'm responsible for tidying up
I know you want to help
Of course you want because you are a nice person
But you can 't keep up with Mesa Verde.
And I can 't . . .
won 't let you carry it
We worked so hard not to let Chuck 's damn revenge plan threaten the future we 're building
I will not allow him to jeopardize our cause
no i will handle it
Myself Jimmy McGill himself
OK
you gotta let me do it myself

All right
thanks


I . . . finished

I just retouched the bottom edge
A little bit
is it okay


Of course
looks great
can you take me to my car
Of course, no problem
Let me tell you it 's not usually like this here
Of course
I don 't think so




good, very good




how long has he had a fever
three days
Okay
There is no problem with the heart and lungs, there is no redness in the throat, it should not be a streptococcal infection
If you ask your mother, will she let you eat it?

very good
bye


Who else
Stomach cramps, sinusitis, and possibly a sprained ankle
What about the American guy who wants revenge?
see him next
Mr. Clark
doctor is ready
What can I do to help Mr. Clark today?
Our mutual acquaintance should have called beforehand
He told me what I wanted but didn 't say much
ok i need a package this big


How many grams
so big

Clinic
Voluntary Clinic








Hey
Hey
Is this seat occupied?


what 's the situation

Last night at the detention center
I 've met a few elderly trustees?

come one



do this thing
big misunderstanding
absolutely impossible
Who wants to make trouble, I don 't want to

Whichever lucky guy in the D.A. 's office came across
can understand
It 's a felony, right?
It 's actually . . . eat it
A classic case of excessive accusation with no intention of offending

I 'm happy to negotiate civilly I 'm always ready for a deal
call me monty hall
Host of the Making a Deal game show
So you 're ready to sign a plea deal, Monty
If a favorable plea agreement
I 'm not perfect
I am also willing to take responsibility in a way that is satisfactory to myself and the country

ok good luck
'Good luck' means 'I hope you are well' or 'I accept your challenge'
i hope hello
deal with them properly they may agree
'they' are not you
sue your case
no man not me

You 've never had any luck, have you?
- Wrong timing - No conflict of interest
conflict of interest
I expected this
We 've worked together so many times it 's impossible for the boss to put me in charge of this case

Not Erickson
Neither in the Albuquerque office
we all know you Jimmy

- who is that - i don 't know
They brought a man from Belem
call the sea
what 's the sea
I don 't know how the boss described her as 'tough but fair'



I have to go



good luck

Burgers are getting cold

do you want to eat
Really
too much trans fat
That 's the best fat

Did they let you keep that car?
- What - Davis Main
Did they let you keep that German car?
Really sorry










US-Mexico border


Ms Hai

- Mr. McGill - please call me Chuck
Please come in through the front door
They said let me put things in the letterbox
Yes, trouble, put all the batteries in

did your brother ever have the keys to this house
The recent troubles were there before
He helped me buy groceries
but we fought
Now I 've hired someone specifically to do this for me
Did you take away your brother 's keys after you hired someone?
i changed the lock
Going back to this conflict, am I going to figure out the details? Did he attack you?

no not like that
He forced me into a closet
does he have a weapon
I just said he used a poker to pry open my desk
but he would never use it against me
Do you feel personally threatened?
My brother has a lot of problems but he still has limits
So are you willing to testify even if he is your family
unfortunately yes
if we continue
I will ask you to testify under oath
I have handled cases involving family members before
Victims in it end up unwilling to cooperate with us
this won 't happen
i want to know your strategy
Well . . . as a lawyer
I think there should be a higher standard
I 'm not going to show mercy to your brother just because he 's also a lawyer
it 's of course
The point of contention will revolve around the felony of breaking into another 's home
Your brother will try to defend a misdemeanor but I will insist on a felony charge
This means that there may be a trial

Now I want to ask
your physical condition
Are you able to appear in court in your current state?
personally
I appreciate you coming to my house today to accommodate me but don 't worry
Just make some small adjustments
I can still stay out for a while and it won 't bother the court.
Then I 'll start working on it
unless you have other considerations
I 'm just. . .
i was just thinking
Jimmy has a good heart
I believe
It 's not making excuses for what he did
but he is my brother
I know him. . .
He gets excited easily and can 't control his temper
I understand but it 's not as simple as losing a temper
I will not justify his actions
But I wonder if there is a better solution
for all









icy gift



What do you think is going on, maybe the hunter fired the gun?

Probably

is a hunter




US-Mexico border














drug discovery





kneel down









God, how long has this cigarette been out?
I found it in the glove box
want me to guess
Maybe I bought it when all the doors are still matching



The Assistant District Attorney gave me a plea deal today
and then
Not what I expected
is it a bad thing

only. . .
Different
She gave me a pre-litigation transfer
Pleas without trial and with no criminal record
Really
pre-litigation transfer

That 's great Jimmy
This is my best result, right?
Yes
what does she want you to confess to
All forcible entry felony
Minor assault and property damage
I didn 't do anything to him but they still listed personal attacks
not the worst
It doesn 't matter as long as they don 't sue you, right?
Can you do it all year long
Don 't let Victor with the 'K' in the middle come out and do things
no problem giselle
Besides, if I 'm not obedient, I 'll have to go to jail immediately.

already lucky
She certainly doesn 't want to make trouble like a trial.
I guess so

Jimmy this is good news
Chuck must be pissed
You make a big difference
In fact the pre-litigation transfer was Chuck 's idea
Depend on
Yes
what is he playing

There is a condition for pretrial transfer. My written confession must be immediately turned over to the New Mexico Bar Association.
your written felony confession
To me I thought he wanted me to go to jail
Actually, he just wanted to revoke my lawyer 's license.

what are you going to do

I knew the bar was a problem
So I was going to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor, at most, get a reprimand and maybe a temporary suspension, but . . .
Admit felony disbarment

yeah if i lose the trial
Then I still have to face the bar and possibly even jail time
he trapped me
you can give it a go
Disciplinary committee will consider mitigating circumstances
Don 't Chuck know the Bar Association owner
Chuck 's credit for those people 's careers
He and his cronies will join forces against me
I fight alone
- You are not alone - Kim
don 't do that Jimmy
you need me
You can 't defend yourself
You and I both know
I won 't let you face this battle alone
- are you sure - sure
because i don 't . . .

why would you want to . . .

please
just for this guy
does it worth
Let 's call this the sunk cost fallacy.

what should I do now
Now
We 'll take the pre-litigation transfer and give Chuck some color.
