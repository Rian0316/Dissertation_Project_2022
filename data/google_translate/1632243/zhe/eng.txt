 Problem ? This is the worst cobbler I 've ever eaten .
 It tastes like it 's made of actual ground- up shoemaker .
 Amusing . A play on the two meanings of " cobbler . "


 Hey , guys .
 Guess who I found at LAX ?
 My baby sister Priya .
 Excuse me , I object .
 You propose a guessing game , yet you don 't give me enough time to guess .
 For the record , I was going to say :
 " Your sister Priya . " Oh , Sheldon .
 You haven 't changed a bit , have you ?
 Why would I change ?
 The hope has been that you 'd eventually bend to public opinion .
 So , Priya , what brings you back to L. A. ?
 I have a one- day layover on my way to Toronto .
 Corporate merger . Can you believe it ?
 Little Priya 's one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India .
 Given that when we met her , she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company , it 's actually extremely plausible .
 And your poll numbers just keep dropping .
 I want to catch up with all of you , but first I really must visit the loo .
 I 'm going , too ; I 'll show you where it is .
 All right , this goes without saying , but I 'm just going to say it anyway .
 Hands off my sister .
 Why would I touch her ?
 She 's covered with airplane germs .
 I 'm so not talking to you .
 I 'm talking to him . Hey .
 I 've got a girlfriend now .
 Oh , please .
 My sister 's much hotter than your girlfriend , and you know it .
 Let 's just agree they 're both hot .
 But dude , that 's my sister you 're talking about !
 Okay , forget who 's hotter .
 The first time Priya came to L. A. , Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship and to you that neither of us would hit on her .
 Did you pinky- swear ?

 Yes .
 Okay , then .
 Cobbler . I 'm still laughing .

 It 's really nice to see you again , Leonard .
 Yeah . It 's good to see you , too .
 Here you go .
 Thanks .


 Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !

 So you got any special plans with your sister ? Oh , not really .
 Just hang out .
 I always tell people , " If you have only one day in Los Angeles , make it a train day . "
 Train day ?
 The fun starts with brunch at Carney 's in Studio City , a hotdog stand in a converted railroad dining car .
 Next stop , Travel Town , an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines , cars , and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s .
 And , finally , we 're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood , for dinner at- that 's right - the Hollywood Carney 's ,
 I don 't think we 're going to do that .
 Well , then apparently you hate fun .
 Priya 's not back yet ? Well , I guess that 's not unusual .
 Women , men , the whole sitting- standing deal .
 So what are we talking about ? Uh , my plans with Priya .
 He rejected Train Day .
 Did you make it clear that it 's two different train cars turned into hotdog stands ?
 Abundantly .
 I guess he just hates fun .
 That 's what I said !
 Okay , so ... what 's new with you guys ? I have a girlfriend now .
 Hey , good for you !
 Yeah , I just want to put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction .
 Happy ?
 So , Priya , what are your plans while you 're here ? I don 't know .
 I just have the one day .
 Do you like trains ?
 Not particularly .
 You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight .
 " You are in a forest .
 " There is quicksand to the west , a path leads to the east . "
 Go east .
 " An iron gate blocks your way . "
 Open gate .
 " It 's locked . "
 Hmm .
 Well , so much for that .
 It 's getting pretty late .
 How come you 're still up ?
 I found an emulator online that lets you play classic text- based computer games from the 1980s .
 It runs on the world 's most powerful graphics chip : imagination . That 's pretty cool . Oh , yes .


 You 've really got to get out more .
 Go north . " You can 't go that way . "
 Go west .
 " A troll blocks your passage . "
 Okay .
 Fasten your seatbelts .

 Kill troll . " With what ? "
 With sword .
 " You don 't have the sword . "
 Good golly , it 's as if it 's actually happening to me .
 Raj finally went to bed .
 Sheldon 's still up .
 You said he goes to bed at 9 : 00 .
 Yeah , he does , but he got caught up in a computer game and ...
 Hit troll with axe !
 My , this is one tough troll . Can 't you get rid of him ?
 If the past is any indication , no .
 Leonard , I 'm trapped in quicksand !
 The axe is dragging me down ! Drop axe !
 Drop axe , brilliant !
 Give me a minute .
 Sheldon . Hold on .
 Trying to figure out how to get the bucket , so I can carry the mud past the dragon .
 Sheldon , you need to work in the morning . I know !
 Well , then bed , mister !
 Five more minutes !
 Really ?
 You 're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar ?
 You know what happens when you yawn in public .
 Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula .
 You don 't want that , do you ?
 No .
 But it 's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated .
 Who was at the door ?
 Uh , building manager .
 They have to fix a pipe , so the water 'll be off tomorrow from noon to 2 : 00 .
 That 's unacceptable . We 're supposed to be given written notice .
 Well , no , it doesn 't matter - we 'll be at work .
 What if I spill tomato soup on my shirt , and have to come home to change , only to find there 's no water for an enzyme soak ?
 Bifurcated uvula , Sheldon !
 I 'll have the chicken noodle . Good night !

 We 're going to have to be very quiet .
 I know how to get the bucket !
 I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it .
 Let 's see .
 Go north . " You are in a forest . "
 Go north .
 " You are in a forest . "
 Go north .
 " You are in a forest . " Oh dear , I believe I 'm lost .
 Well , I 'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow . No , no , no !
 You just took a wrong turn .
 You just need to map it out .
 Come on , I 'll help you .
 So you stopped at the stream , and you turned north three times ?
 Yes . You 're right .
 You 're lost .
 Good luck .

 Oh !
 Leonard .
 Wake up . Huh ?
 Wh - Sorry .
 For what ?
 When I 'm in bed with a girl , it 's just - it 's my go- to response . I don 't know .


 It 's 6 : 00 .
 I have to get back to Raj 's before he wakes up and realizes I 'm gone .
 Oh .
 Right .
 Sure .
 I wish you could stay in L. A. a while longer .
 Mmm , me , too . You know , I was thinking :
 There are some great research facilities in India .
 Where are you going with this , Leonard ?
 Well , I 'm just saying , you know , I don 't have any real ties here , so if I were to move to New Delhi , we could , you know - go out .
 Leonard , didn 't we have this conversation five years ago ?
 Well , yes , but ... things have changed .
 You know , you 're older , I 'm older -
 Look , no more superhero bed sheets .
 Sweetheart , just because we have fun when I come to town doesn 't mean
 I want to have a serious relationship . It doesn 't ?
 Mm- mm .
 And besides , I could never bring a white boy home to my parents .
 They 'd have a cow .
 Which is a much bigger deal in India .
 I 'm not that white .
 My great- great- grandmother was half Cherokee .
 I know that 's not the right kind of Indian , but it is something . You 're funny .
 Leonard ?

 What ? I heard a woman laughing .
 Oh , uh , yeah .
 I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman .
 Oh !
 Well , good job .
 Quite convincing .
 I smell perfume .
 Air freshener .
 And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck ? Rash . That 's a bad rash .

 My sympathies .
 I 'm no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis .
 Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection ?
 Uh , yeah , yeah , that sounds great . Very well .
 I 'm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch .
 Okay , he 's in the bathroom . Let 's go .

 Do you prefer ointment or cream ?
 Cream .
 With or without a numbing agent ?
 Without .
 Really , Leonard ?
 There are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis .
 Fine .
 With .
 Prescription or non- prescription strength ?
 Use your best judgment .
 Well , I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC .
 It 's usually indicated for acutely inflamed hemorrhoids , but it also goes nicely with non- mucosal body parts .
 Sounds great . Excellent choice .

 Okay , hurry , hurry , hurry .
 Come on , come on , come on .
 Priya ?
 Good morning , Sheldon .
 For shame , Leonard , for shame . And to think ,
 I was ready to waste the last of my good hemorrhoid cream on you .
 Making pretty good time , huh ?
 Is that really what you want to talk about , Leonard ?
 No .
 What do you want to talk about ?
 Please don 't tell anyone
 I spent the night with Raj 's sister .
 There it is .
 What if someone asks ?
 No one 's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj 's sister .
 Perhaps , but they might ask me something else .
 Like what ?
 Like
 " Has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently ? "
 Priya and I are both adults .
 I didn 't betray Raj .
 In fact , you did , but I was referring to Howard .
 What are you talking about ?
 April 12 , 2005 .
 Bob 's Big Boy , Toluca Lake .
 Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time .
 She was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob 's Super Big Boy hamburger .
 In order to preserve your friendship , you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her .
 I had a patty melt .
 Okay , fine , I betrayed Howard .
 And Raj .
 All right , and Raj .
 And me .
 You ?
 Violation of the Roommate Agreement 's overnight guest notification clause .
 Okay , fine , I - I 'm a horrible human being .
 I 'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena .
 You 're far too short to be Darth Vader .
 At best you might be a turncoat Ewok .
 My point is :
 Priya 's gone and it would be much better if no one else found out about us .
 You mean you want me to keep a secret ?
 Yes .
 You know I can 't keep a secret .
 You can if you try .
 Think about it this way : um , if I were Batman and you were Alfred , you 'd keep that secret , right ?
 Why do you get to be Batman ?
 Because Batman has the secret .
 Alfred has secrets , too .
 Like what ?
 Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl .
 Which I 've now just told to Batman .
 See , I cannot keep a secret .
 Ta- dah !
 What ?
 Ta- dah .
 It 's short for ... ♪ Da- da- da- da ! ♪
 Kind of busy here , Sheldon .
 I know , that 's why I shortened it .
 What do you want ?
 I came to go over your alibi for last night .
 What alibi ?
 You 've asked me to lie on your behalf , and as you know ,
 I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonesty , so I 've provided you with an ironclad alibi .
 You couldn 't have spent last night with Priya because you were with another woman .
 Oh , I 'm so sure I 'm gonna regret this , but who was I with ?
 The fun- loving and morally loose Miss Maggie McGarry .
 Oh , God .
 You met her at Pasadena 's most popular Irish watering hole ,
 Lucky Baldwin 's , where Maggie spends her nights tending bar with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams .
 " Leonard , call me if you are interested in coitus .
 Sincerely , Maggie McGarry . "
 And if anyone were to actually call that number , they will hear this .
 Top of the morning to you .
 You 've reached Maggie McGarry .
 Leave a message after the wee little beep .
 It 's pretty convincing , huh ?
 That wasn 't even a real person .
 And here is the clincher : a lock of Maggie 's flaming auburn hair .
 Where 'd you get that ?
 From an orangutan in the primate lab .
 An orangutan ?
 Well , no one 's going to run a DNA test on it , Leonard .
 Honestly , you overthink everything .
 Sheldon , I don 't need an alibi .
 Nobody 's going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip .
 Thank you .
 Now , don 't worry , everything is going to be fine . Hey .

 Hey , Leonard , will you please tell Howard my sister has never been attracted to him ?
 Come on , Raj , how am I supposed to know who she is attracted to or was attracted to or who she might be attracted to in the future ?
 And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation .
 Because I , too , know absolutely nothing about Priya 's preferences in male companionship .
 And with that , I will re- zip my lip .
 Hey , so what did you guys think
 I didn 't see it .
 Didn 't see it ?
 What were you doing ?
 Uh , I was out .

 Yeah , I , uh , went for a drink .
 Really , you ?
 Where , w- where 'd you go ?
 To , uh ...
 Lucky Baldwin 's .
 Oh , I 've heard of that place .
 Isn 't that Pasadena 's favorite Irish watering hole ?
 Yes .
 Did you meet anyone interesting there , perhaps a promiscuous , redheaded barmaid ?
 As a matter of fact ...
 I - I- I- I- I can 't , I can 't ,
 I can 't do it .
 Sure you can , you 're doing fine , it 's very believable .
 I 'm sorry , Raj , but the truth is ,
 I was with Priya last night .
 Don 't listen to him .
 He 's still light- headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system .
 What were you doing with Priya ?
 I believe they engaged in coitus , but more importantly , if Leonard had not abandoned his story , would you have found it plausible ?
 You slept with my sister ? !
 Yeah .
 How could you ?
 We had a pact .
 Excuse me , I think " How could you ?
 She 's my sister " takes precedence over a five- year- old pinky swear .
 May I point out , in a parallel universe , your friends are saying
 " Maggie McGarry - she sounds lovely . "
 Look , I- I admit it , I may have crossed a line here , but come on , Raj , your sister is a grown woman , and to her , I 'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate .
 I don 't believe it .
 This is a terrible betrayal of my trust .
 No , w- w- would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart , and she kind of stomped on it ?
 How hard did she stomp ?
 Very hard .
 Okay , I 'm good .
 Well , Raj ,
 I just want to say that I 'd never betray your trust .
 Unlike Leonard , I respect you .
 Really ?
 Mm- hmm .
 Was it out of respect that you didn 't tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal ?
 Dude , I put that thing on my face !
 I think a more amusing violation of Raj 's trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving .
 Hey , I didn 't see you giving back your Snoopy snow cone maker .
 That was all a lie ?
 This year 's gifts are already wrapped .
 And as long as we 're talking about betraying our friends , how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard 's food ?
 Well , excuse me .
 That was not a betrayal .
 That was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting " mothy . "
 You put moths in my food ? !
 For science .
 I can 't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth .
 Well , I can 't believe you used Sheldon 's toothbrush .
 You used my toothbrush ?
 Not the brush part , just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums .
 Okay , I- I think it 's safe to say that we 've all done some things we 're not particularly proud of .
 But come on , we 're friends .
 Friends overlook each other 's minor lapses .
 For the record , Howard , I 'm sorry that I broke our pact .
 Thank you .
 And I 'm sorry about your phone and Thanksgiving .
 And while we 're at it , you don 't have to wash our clothes on the Fourth of July .
 As long as we 're apologizing ,
 Sheldon , I 'm , I 'm sorry I used your toothbrush .
 And I 'm sorry ... but that behavior is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated .
 We are no longer friends .
 I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving .
 With real puffing smoke ?
 Yes .
 All right .
 But I 'm watching you .
 Hey , you 've got Snoopy out .
 Can I have a snow cone ?
 Well , sure .
 This is pretty good .
 What flavor is this ?
 Guess .
 Papaya ?
 No . Guava ?
 You 're so close .
 I give up .
 Mango caterpillar .
 What are you doing ? !
 You said you liked it .
