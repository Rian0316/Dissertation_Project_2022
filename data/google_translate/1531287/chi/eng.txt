 Okay , this is ridiculous .
 I can 't believe those two are still bagpiping . I know .
 It 's been six hours .
 Must be that tantric bagpiping that Sting is into .
 She keeps yelling out for him to play the bagpipes harder , but it sounds like he 's bagpiping her pretty hard .
 There 's a glass of water in my bedroom You have neighbors !
 Shut the bagpipes up !

 Ted , I hate to have to be the one to tell you this .
 Marshall and Lily are getting a divorce . No , they 're not .
 Just listen to what I witnessed yesterday .
 Baby , you mind washing that ?
 No problem .
 I should go .
 She makes him wash his dishes right away , Ted .
 I give 'em two , maybe , three weeks tops .
 Barney , that 's not a big deal .
 And it 's certainly not a big enough deal for you to be holding my hands . They 're in big trouble , Ted .
 I see what 's going on .
 You , my friend , are suffering from a little known condition --
 " little known " because I just made it up -- called New Relationship Smugness .
 You and Robin are in the honeymoon phase . Everything 's perfect .
 Every song on the radio 's about you .
 Every other couple sucks .
 Enjoy it .
 N. R. S. doesn 't last forever .
 It does when you 're this awesome .
 Hey , check it out .
 Robin and I have been keeping a tally of how many beds we 've done it in . We 're up to 83- and- a- half .
 A half ?
 19 century ottoman in an antique shop .
 Hey .
 Hey , what 'up ?
 Hey , tiger . How ya holding up ?
 Do you need a hug ?
 You want to talk about yesterday ? Safe space .
 Barney thinks Lily asking you to wash your dishes right away is a sign your marriage is crumbling .
 What ?
 Why ?
 Lily likes a clean sink , so I do the dishes right away ; what 's the big deal ?
 I 'll tell you what the big deal is .
 You know how I was always the best at being single ? No . No .
 Well , now I am the best at relationships .
 Even better than you and Lily . Aw , look at you .
 Had a girlfriend for five minutes , you think you can play with the big boys -- adorable .
 Son ...
 I 've been in a relationship since you had a ponytail and were playing Dave Matthews on your mama 's Casio .
 I 'm a good boyfriend in my sleep .
 I can rock a killer foot rub with one hand and brew a kick- ass pot of chamomile in the other that would make you weep .
 Hell ,
 I 've forgotten more about microwaving fat- free popcorn and watching
 Sandra Bullock movies than you 'll ever know , but thanks for your concern , rook .
 Mashall , let me ask you one question .
 Sure .
 Do you mind if there is sink full of dirty dishes ? Not really .
 Then it 's Lily 's problem , not yours .
 Yeah , but if I said that to her , it would only lead to a fight , so ... Oh .
 You fight . See , Robin and I never fight .
 Of course you do .
 No .
 And here 's the secret : evy time it looks like we 're about to get into a fight ...
 Um , why is there a bag of panties labeled " April 2008 " in your closet ?
 So any time you think you might have a fight you just get up and leave ? 100 % effective .
 Can 't fight if you 're not there . at 's what Gandhi taught us .
 Boy , that 'not true .

 I can 't believe that Robin puts up with that . Oh , don 't worry .
 She 's got a great way to avoid fights , too .
 Um , are ties machine washable ?
 No , they most ceainly are not . Why ? What is in your hand ?
 Oh , my God , what 's in your hand ? !

 Okay , so you walk away . Robin gets naked . Those are the two stupidest ways to handle conflict I 've ever heard .
 Actually , the naked thing ain 't ba
 That felt kind of weird .
 Okay , call me crazy . a problem comes up , Lily and I actually talk about it .
 There are so many great things to do withhe human mouth . Why waste it on talking ?
 But if you insist , here 's what I would say about the dishes if I were Lily 's husband .
 Barney , you 're home !

 Get to the point !
 All right .
 Thanks , doll .

 Sweetie , are you going to wash that ?
 I 'm glad you bring that up . No .
 And here 's why .

 Lily , I know you don 't like a dirty sink . But does that make it my job to keep it clean ?
 I mean , if one day
 I lookp at the living room ceiling and ink , " Hey , I 'd like a replica of the Sistine Chal up there . " would it be your job to paint it ?
 Well , no . Of course not .
 So , baby , by the same logic , if you don 't like looking at a sink full of dishes , Exactly !


 Wow .
 Thanks for explaining that .
 I get so confused . That 's because you 're a woman .
 I don 't even know why we 're laughing !
 Of course you don 't .

 You 're kidding me with this . Hang on , Ted .
 Let 's ar the man out .
 Once I have her attention , it 's time to bring out the big guns .
 Look , I love you .
 But , baby , with the little energy I have left after work ,
 I want to shower you with love , not wash some silly dishes .
 You 're right . I 'll do the dishes .
 Right after I do this .
 Oh , yeah .
 Now turn around .
 Fi . Oh , yeah .
 Are you going to hit him or should I ?
 He 's right .
 No , he 's not .
 Marshall , lookt me .
 Do not get drawn into Barney Stinson 's circus tent of funhouse mirrors and flawed logic . This is exactly how you got the earring back in '03 .
 Hey , that earring looked cool .
 It did look cool , didn 't it ?
 Marsil , stay with me !
 Barney is wrong .
 No , he isn 't .
 I hate doing my dishes right away .
 You just said you don 't mind !
 I hate it , Ted ! I hate it with a boundless , burning fury !
 I ha it , I hate it , I hate it !
 You 're welcome .
 Hey , guys . Hey . Oh , good .
 There you are .
 You 'll tell me the truth .
 Barney says that you two never fight .
 Huh . I guess that 's true . Told ya .
 No way .
 I love you both , but you are the two most emotionally ill- equipped individuals in the history of relationships .
 You two must have had at least one fight .
 You know what ? We did . Aha !
 ROBlN : Mm- hmm .
 There was one small dispute about which one of us was morawesome .
 Speaking of which , I am so gla we 're going skiing this weekend .
 I need a break .
 The upstairs neighbors are driving me crazy .
 Yeah , it 's bad . m gonna say something to them .
 Thanyou . Great .
 Okay , we all have our assignments r the weekend .
 Ted , you 're going to stand up to your neighbors . Marshall , you 're going to stand up to Lily .
 And Robin , I 'm gonna need yo in sort of a crouched position on the bear- skin rug at our ski chalet .
 Ready ? Break !
 Bye , guys . Bye .
 Have fun .
 Barney .
 With his crazy , well - thought- out theories that probably would work . Marsil , I 'm just gonna say this one more time .
 It 's a bad ide
 I think it could work . Okay , two more times .
 It 's a bad idea . Listen , Barney lays out some logical points
 Lily is a reasonable woman .
 I think th if I explain it to her , she 'llet it and I 'll get my way .
 Uh , no .
 She 'll get mad , and yoll get in a huge fight . Slap bet ? ap bet .

 Baby , could youwa sh your dishes ?
 Lily , I 'm glad that you bring that up .
 Can I stay here tonight ?

 The ski bunnies are back !
 ( both laughing ) Hey , guys .
 ( smooching loudly ) How was your trip ?
 So perfect .
 We just spent the whole weekend cuddling by the re .
 No black diamonds , but a lot of red hearts .
 Aw ... Okay , I 'm gonna go unpack .
 Hey , you . Yeah ?

 Oh , man . What the hell has gotten into you two ?
 When did you become so nauseating ?
 Isn 't it great to finally see her fulfilled emotionally , spiritually and sexually ?
 Um , I dated her for a year .
 Yeah .
 Anyway , w was your weekend ?
 Terrible , and it 's all your fault , okay ?
 I took your stup advice !
 Baby , could you wash your dishes ?
 Lily , I 'm glad th you bring that up .
 No , and here is why ...

 Okay .
 So , it 's like this , okay ?
 Yeah , sure .
 You wa me to go ahead and wash my dish .
 But maybe ...
 I nt you ... to pai the ceiling , right ?
 Like , maybe I should say , " Okay , yeah .
 I 'll wash my dish
 " if you get up the and just -- you paint naked babies on the ceiling . "
 You know ? It just like ...
 I don 't know what happened .
 I 'm a lawyer .
 I argue for a living , but when it comes to Lily , I just get all . flustered .
 How could you not ?
 I an , the girl 's all eyes and boobs .
 What happened to the " I 'm tired after my draining day , showering you with love " argument ?
 I should have written that down .
 Look , Lily , I ...
 I make more money than you .
 Excuse me ? !
 Dance for me .
 Oh , Marshall . Dude .
 It all made so much sense when you said it , but when I said it , iturned into a fight .
 And ce Lily and I start fighting , the fight starts to mutate and multly .

 So you 're saying that you shouldn 't have to wash dishes because you work harder than me ?
 Okay , that 's not what I 'm saying -- but it 's true .

 I am molding the future leaders of tomorrow .
 I can 't believe you 'd rather be killed ...

 If you need to go in t middle of the night , either turn the bathroom light on or sit down .
 My mother does not hate you .
 She is neutral about you .

 I just don need to hear it , especially at night .
 ( gravelly voice ) : Danny 's not here , Mrs. Torrance .
 Please don 't do that .
 Man , Ly fights dirty .
 She 's small but vicious like aadger that your brother 's caught and starved for ve days and then put in your sleeng bag .
 I should just go home and apologize . No .
 What you need is a surge . Fight harder .
 Picture it , Marshall , never having to wash another dish as long as you live , yet all the dishes aralways clean .
 Why , this would take all thanxiety out of snacking .
 No more holding open your shirt to form a makeshift bowl for yo salty treats .
 That world is yours , Marshall . dip it in some ranch dressing , enjoy .
 Yes , right .
 No ! rney 's stupid ideas are what got you into this quagmire .
 There 's noxit strategy .
 Just wash your stupid dishes . No ! Those dishes are my manhood !
 And I want to leave my manhood dirty in the sink , caked with ketchup and pasta ...
 What are you eating ? ... then damn it , that 's my rit !
 I 'll wash my manhood when I 'mood and ready !
 Where was he not sitting ?
 Hey , Barnstormer .
 He Ro- Ro . Ooh ! Okay , now you have adorable nicknames ?
 Seriously , what 's going on with your two ?
 Nothing . We 're just happy .
 It 's like Gandhi said , " A smile don 't cost nothing , gar . "
 Mm- hmm . I 'm not sure you know whGandhi is .
 So , um , Ted , did you talk to our neighbors ?
 Yes , yeah , I did .
 I went up therready to set them straight .

 They 're old ?
 Really old .
 So what did you do ?
 Well , didn 't have the heart to tell them to stop , because , well , good for them .
 So I just weomed them to the building , had a hard candy , nodded politely at some racist comments and then left .


 I don 't care if the dishes aren 't done .
 Okay , if you care , you do it . Great .
 Then I don 't care if you have an orgasm .
 If you care , you do it .
 I went 18 years without the touch of a woman . can do it again .
 You might have to .


 I don 't know what to do .
 Lily and I have never had a fight this long . It 's like I don 't even exist .
 On Sunday morning , she made pancake , Ted .
 Pancake and bacon strip . It 's your own fault .
 You took relationship advice from Barney .
 Well , maybe Barney has it all figured out .
 He and Ro- Ro are the best couple now .
 Lily and I have been dethroned .
 You know what , I 'm not buying i
 All that cutesy , lovey- dovey crap , that 's not them .
 And I know for a factthat Robin hates ni
 Thanks , Robbsy- wobbsy .
 Yeah , I dot do nicknames .
 Finished with the sports page , Sherbs ?
 Seriously , stop .
 Hey , Robin , it 's T- Mose .
 Yeah , I don 't like them on you either .
 Well , she obviously likes them now .
 And , come on somebody had to put an end to T- Mose .
 No , T- Mose w awesome . I 'm thinking of bringing it back .
 Bagpiping sounds a little different today .
 It 's all echo- y . Yeah . They 're in the bathroom .
 I think they 're bagpiping on the shower chair .
 , hey , Ted .
 How are Marshall and Lily ?
 I worry about those two , I really do .
 You and your big , giant heart .
 Okay , enough . The jig is up .
 Ted , whatever do you mean ?
 Who 's this guy ? We 'll get to that .
 You see , I knew something was wrong . u two were too happy , too shiny , too nickname- y .
 Didn 't add up . You two never fight ?
 Horse apples .
 You fight all ... the . time .
 How would you know that ?
 Who the hell is Phil ?
 Your downstairs neighbor .
 Hi .
 I 'm Phil . 12- B.


 So Phil tells me that Ro- Ro and the Barnstormer have been fighting ... a lot . Care to explain ?

 Okay .
 Everything was going great .
 Our no- fighting techniques were working perfectly until we went on thatki trip last weekend .
 So I showed Marshall that Lily 's argument was bananas and now he 'll never have to wash another dish .
 High two .
 That 's terrible advice . You agree with Lily ?
 You ...







 This no- fighting thing is over , huh ?
 I think so .
 How could you possibly agree with Lily ? ! I can 't believe that you made Lily get in a fight about this !
 She 's shortethan him !
 And it didn 't end there . We 've been fighting ever since .
 All those fightse kept not having -- they all came back around .
 The tie Robin murdered . The tiny camera I foundin th
 That 's how a quarterback sts sharp .
 Monday morning , he sits on a bag of ic and studies the game tape . Barney for the millionth time ...
 You don 't get to be as good as I am ... using football analogies ... without reviewingthe fundamentals and studying technique ! does not make it any less creepy .
 Whoo , yeah !
 I knew it !
 I knew you guys were acting too cute and perfect !
 Look , we were just sick of everyone pointing out how crappy a relationships we both are .
 Yeah , it was sort of nice to be the perfect couplefor a TED :
 I knew you were lying .
 You got to wake up pretty early to slip one by the T- Mose .
 Stop it .
 LlLY ( singsong voice ) : Marshall , dinner 's ready .
 Did you -- did you make any for me ?
 No , but it 's your favorite .


 ( sighing ) :
 Hey .
 We need your advice .






 I 'll wash my dishes right away from now until the day I die .
 I don 't care when you wash the dishes .
 But if it 's something chse- based like a nice ziti , at least soak it , okay ?
 Of course , baby .
 Oh , I love you .
 I love you , too .
 ROBlN :
 See ?
 Right there , how did you just do that ?
 How 'd you just fix everything ? I don 't know .
 I guess sometimes you just have to set your ego aside .
 Yeah .
 An- And remember at the love that you have for that other person is way more important than winning .

 More important than winning
 Stop , op it . Seriously , what 's the secret ?
 Okay , look , the honeymoon period may be over , but now you can get into the real stuff .
 And honestly , that 's the best part .
 Good night . So what do we do now ?
 I guess we got to start talking more and get into the real stuff .
 Yeah . Or there 's a bench in the elevator . Ooh , that 's better .
 Mm- hmm . Hey , swhat if we 're not the best couple in the world ?
 Totally .
 It 's not a competition . No . We win !
 Best couple in the world !
 Whoo , yeah !
 Guess what ?
 These glasses are plastic .
 So we can just throw them away .
 That means no dirty dishes in the sink .
 Mm , you 're dirty .
 Maybe I shouldeave you in the sink .
