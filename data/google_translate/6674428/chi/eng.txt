 00 : 00 : 04, 137 -- > 00 : 00 : 05, 870 What- what are you doing ?
 The light is red so I came to a stop .
 You 're in a stolen cop car with a dead hooker in the trunk .
 You don 't have to obey traffic laws .
 I know I don 't have to .
 The fun is choosing to .
 Hey . Missed you guys at the faculty mixer .
 Ah , you should have been there ; dessert was bananas .
 Sorry , that was misleading .
 The dessert was pie , but the pie was bananas .
 Actually , the pie was cherry , but the taste of the pie was ... bananas .
 Those mixers are such a waste of university money .
 If they spent less money on frivolous nonsense and more money on science , we 'd all be better off .
 You 're a theoretical physicist .
 What more do you need than an office and a whiteboard ?
 Someday , my new formulas on entropy decrease due to quantum decoherence will need to be tested and that will require funding .
 Your theories are pretty abstract .
 I wouldn 't even know how to design an experiment to prove them .
 Says the experimental physicist .
 Well , I know a place the university can make some cuts .
 Bye , Leonard .
 One second , one second .
 He 's got a point .
 In order to corroborate your string theory research , you 'd have to create a black hole .
 Wouldn 't that destroy the Earth ?
 Perhaps , but we 'd all go to the grave knowing I was right .
 I guess you could create a contained microscopic black hole .
 Huh . Interesting .
 Welcome back , Leonard .
 Sorry , you 're out .
 What did I do ?
 Exactly .

 Ooh , this one 's pretty .
 My mother wouldn 't approve ; shows too much clavicle .
 Mm .
 She calls it " the bosom 's welcome mat . "
 I can 't wait to get drunk and pick a fight with her at your wedding .
 It 's just so hard to tell what will look good on me .
 No . This is just to give you ideas .
 You know , do- do you want something simple and elegant ?
 I mean , do you want a train ?
 Ooh , we 're talking about trains .
 Not the kind of trains you like .
 Oh , I like all kinds of trains ... steam , diesel , coal , elevated , bullet .
 I defy you to name a train that I don 't like .
 The kind on the back of a wedding dress ?
 I did not see that coming . Good job .
 But while we 're on the subject of fashion ,
 I 'm asking the university for some funding tomorrow .
 What should I wear ?
 Well , I 've got a push- up bra I can loan you that always gets me free drinks .
 Mm .
 How much money are you asking for ? $500 million .
 Then I 'd go no bra .
 What do you need that kind of money for ?
 I have figured out an experimental design that may corroborate my latest thinking on string theory .
 I just need 2, 148 high- power lasers to compress 20 micrograms of gold into a small enough volume to make a microscopic black hole .
 Just nod .
 Mmm .
 Sheldon , they 're not gonna give you half a billion dollars .
 I mean , they won 't even give me that much and I keep promising I can make people 's brains " grow younger . "
 Can you ?
 No . Shh .
 But I need it .
 It 's the only way to settle the contradictions between gravity and quantum mechanics .
 Well , it 's too much money , you can 't ask for that all at once .
 Well , what if I ask for it in six easy installments of $83, 333, 333 . 33 ?
 Okay . What if you asked for $20 million ?
 I 'm sorry , I 'm trying to do science , not hire Lady Gaga to come to my birthday .
 Do you even know who Lady Gaga is ?
 Presumably , the wife of Lord Gaga .
 Sheldon , you know , Penny 's got a point .
 Sometimes when you want something big from someone , you- you got to be careful not to scare them away , you know ?
 You got to start small and- and build up slowly , even if it takes eight years .
 Eight long years .
 That 's oddly specific .
 Have you ever done that ?
 Nope .
 So with this level of high- power laser array , we would actually be able to solve the black hole information paradox once and for all .
 That 's impressive , and how much funding were you looking for ? $20 million .






 Really ?
 You think you can build that for $20 million ?
 Not a chance .
 I 'm sorry , then why are you asking me for it ?
 Because once you 've spent $20 million , you 're much more likely to give me an additional 50 .
 So actually , what you 're saying is with $70 million , you can build this .
 I can see why you 'd think that , but no .
 You can 't go to the board of trustees and say you gave Sheldon Cooper $70 million and have nothing to show for it .
 The only way you 'd be able to save face is to double down .
 No .
 So 140 ?
 And then double again .
 280 ?
 And then ... good news ... not quite double again .
 So , uh , what do you say ?
 We have a deal ?
 He said no ?
 No . That 's only a two letter word .
 You 're gonna have to double down .
 Well , I 'm sorry , Sheldon , but this sort of thing happens .
 Higgs had to wait almost 50 years before they built a collider big enough to prove his theory .
 50 years ?
 But I want to play with it now .
 You just have to wait for science to catch up or technology to get cheaper .
 Think about , uh , DVD players ... they used to cost , like , a thousand dollars , but just the other day I used one to smash a bug .
 Yeah , you- you just have to be patient .
 But what if while I 'm being patient , someone more relentless than me badgers their university into giving them money ?
 If there 's someone more relentless than you ,
 I 'd like to meet them .
 I would not .
 I 'm not waiting for the university to come around .
 I 'll find another way to raise the money .
 Ooh , if it 's one of those booths where we can throw a pie at you ,
 I 'm in for , like , 20 bucks .
 40 bucks if I can throw a DVD player .
 Would you like some champagne ?
 Oh , thank you .
 - Thanks . - Sure .
 This is nice .
 What ? Helping Amy find a dress or day drinking ?
 It 's just nice , okay ?
 What do you think ?
 Amy , oh , my God .
 You look so beautiful .
 I feel beautiful .
 And look : both clavicles .
 Take that , Mom .
 You know what they say : if you got 'em , flaunt 'em .
 Is it possible that the very first dress is dress ?
 Oh , don 't be silly .
 You can 't buy the first dress you try on .
 That 'd be like marrying the first guy that you ...
 You can 't buy the first dress you try on .
 Little finger sandwiches , too .
 This place is amazing .
 Interesting thing about finger sandwiches : you put enough of them together , you got a sandwich .
 Uh , guys , we have a problem .
 - Are you okay ? - What 's wrong ?
 I look amazing in all of these dresses !
 Wow . Look at your waist .
 Where you been hiding that thing ?
 Bernadette , stop .
 Penny , you say something nice now .
 Boy , you know , when Sheldon sees you in that dress , he 's gonna want to methodically take it off , fold it up , carefully place it in a storage box ,
 label it , and then ravish you .
 Should I try on some more ?
 Are you having fun ?
 Am I having fun being beautiful ?
 Of course I am !
 Great . Keep going .
 This is it .
 This is the one .
 Do you love it ?
 Do you ?
 I do .
 Wow .
 Also , wow .
 - Hello , Leonard . - Hi .
 Are you doing anything ?
 I 'm just sitting here at my desk typing on my computer for nothing .
 No .
 That was my guess , but I didn 't want to assume .
 Can you help me shoot my Kickstarter video ?
 Do you really think people are gonna give you half a billion dollars ?
 Of course not , but if I can raise enough seed money to show that I 'm serious , I should be able to attract some major investors .
 And look at the cool incentives I 'm offering .
 " For $50, 000 , I will examine your diet and create a customized bathroom schedule . "
 That 's fitting -- 50 grand down the toilet .
 Well , how about this ?
 For $100, 000 , I will design the flag of your house or apartment .
 And for $1 million ,
 I will come over and tell you what 's wrong with you .
 Aw , and all these years , I 've been getting that for free .
 Don 't be smug , Leonard .
 That 's one of the things that 's wrong with you .
 Well , that was a successful trip .
 Yes .
 Amy found a dress that she liked .
 She sure did .
 She found a dress that looked like ...
 like it made her happy .
 She- she did look happy .
 I mean , her face was just glowing , so ...
 Yeah , we should make sure the photographer knows to just really ... get in there .
 Mm .
 So we agree it 's awful ?
 That dress should be set on fire !
 Should we say something ?
 No , we can 't .
 But don 't you think she brought us with her
 ' cause she wants our honest opinion ?
 No one wants that .
 I do .
 No , ya don 't .
 I don 't want her to look back and think she made some awful mistake .
 You mean like your dumb Cookie Monster tattoo ?
 See ? Was that fun ?
 Someone 's gonna say something .
 It should be us now instead of everyone at her wedding .
 Okay , but as long as we do it gently .
 And together .
 Well , what about my dress ?
 Don 't you like it ?
 - I don 't . - It 's beautiful .
 Hey , Stuart , I 'd like to sell some comic books .
 Oh . Well , I know all about that .
 Step one is flunk out of art school .
 Well , why are you selling 'em ?
 The university is refusing to fund my experiment , so I need to raise money and do it on my own .
 Ah . How much do you need ?
 For a start , I 'm trying to raise $500, 000 .
 Well , I hope you have that rare printed on the skin of actual Superman .
 I know you 're making a joke , but I really do have some valuable issues in here .
 And this is just the first box of many .
 All right , let 's see what you got .
 Huh . Is this a complete run of Todd McFarlane 's
 Yes .
 Ooh , look at this .
 number one ,
 Len Wein 's relaunch of the franchise .
 Yeah . I know what it is .
 I 'm the one who bought it , bagged it , boarded it and taped it shut while wearing white cotton gloves .
 Okay , well , you know ,
 I 'm gonna have to open it to assess its condition .
 Just be gentle .
 It 's never felt the touch of a man before .
 You don 't seem like you really want to sell these .
 Of course I don 't want to sell these .
 These are all important to me , but not as important as science , and if this is the sacrifice I need to make , then so be it .
 Okay . Uh , why don 't you leave these here with me , and I 'll- I 'll price ' em out for you .

 Is it okay if I stand here and watch ?
 Sure .
 If anyone asks , tell them I was brave .
 Hey , I can 't believe you just threw me under the bus .
 I know , right ? That was crazy .
 Well ...
 Do you know how that makes me look ?
 - Uh , that 's an easy one -- bad . - Well ...
 Why didn 't you tell her that you didn 't like the dress , either ?
 I mean , what happened to our united front ?
 I 'm sorry . Is this your first day being a girl ?
 Ooh , did your mom pack your lunch ?
 Of course not .
 Do you know how much it costs to pack a tuna fish sandwich in dry ice and overnight it from Texas ?
 Well , I do , and my mother says it 's too expensive .
 I like tuna fish .
 Do you want it ? I 'll sell it to you for $5, 000 .
 How 's the fundraising going ?
 Oh , that depends . Raj , was that a " yes " ?
 No .
 It 's going badly .
 How much have you raised ?
 Well , with my Kickstarter campaign , selling my collectibles , and the money in my bank account , about $65, 000 .
 Wow . That 's a lot .
 Yeah , not enough .
 It 's so frustrating that science should be held hostage to the almighty dollar .
 Well , don 't give up . You 'll find that money somewhere .
 - You really think so ?
 - No , but it 's good that he has a hobby .
 You ever thought of going to Vegas ?
 Can you be more specific ?
 Vegas ?
 Oh , you mean gambling . Mm .
 Oh . Well , that 's not the worst idea .
 Um , it the worst idea , and I 'm including the year that Raj wore nothing but tracksuits .
 Ordinary people can 't beat a casino , but mathematicians and scientists , they do it all the time .
 Yeah , a group of students from MlT took Las Vegas for millions , and that 's MlT .
 Howard went there .
 Come on , Sheldon .
 I 'll give you a ride out to the desert right now .
 No one is going to Vegas .
 No , we weren 't gonna make it to Vegas .
 Hi . Do you have a minute ?
 Is what I 'm wearing okay , or should I go change first ?
 Depends .
 Look , I 'm sorry .
 I never should have said I didn 't like your dress .
 It 's your wedding , and all that matters is that you feel beautiful .
 Thank you .
 So , are ... are we good ?
 No , we 're not good .
 You ruined my dress .
 Well , why ? I just said you should wear it .
 Well , I can 't wear it now . I mean , I know you hate it .
 That 's all I 'm gonna be thinking about .
 No , I don 't hate it .
 I asked if you liked it , and you said no .
 There is a lot of room between " don 't like " and " hate . "
 You know , it 's- it 's where you find rice pudding and jazz .
 Anyway , who cares what I think ?
 I do .
 You 're the- the coolest , prettiest , best- dressed person in my life .
 Okay , that would be flattering , except I know all the people in your life .
 Look , Amy ,
 I don 't know what to say .
 I think I got stuck on the fact that it 's not a dress I would choose , but it shouldn 't be .
 You know , it 's your dress .
 I mean , hey , would you marry Leonard ?
 Ew .
 Okay , a simple " no " would have been fine , but ... you see my point .
 That we 're different people ?
 Yes , and from now on , I am gonna remember that this wedding is all about you .
 I appreciate that .
 You 're a good maid of honor .
 It 's Bernadette . Hello ?
 I feel bad about hanging Penny out to dry .
 The truth is , I don 't like the dress , either .
 Are you kidding me ?
 Now Bernadette doesn 't like the dress ?
 Oh , she is the worst .
 Anyone seen Sheldon ?
 Last time I saw Sheldon was this morning .
 Careful . Don 't say his name a third time .
 You don 't think he actually went to Las Vegas , do you ?
 Five red .
 This is it .
 - Is everything okay , sir ? - Oh . Hi .
 It 's better than okay .
 I am a physicist , and I have been observing this wheel for hours and running a chi- square analysis , which is how I know that the ball is far more likely to land on 32 , 17 or five .


 So if you could hold off on replacing this wheel ,
 I 'd like to make several large bets .
 Well , good for you . Pelican .
 What 's pelican ?
 - Sir , would you come with us ? - Oh , no .
 I have to place my bet first . This is for science .
 - 17 black . - No ! No !
 Oh , guess who 's no longer allowed to set foot in ... ?
 Wow !
 You look beautiful .
 Really ?
 ' Cause I was gonna return it .
 Why would you return it ?
 You look like a pile of swans .
 I 'm so glad you like it ... because ... it 's gonna be my wedding dress .
 I can 't wait to marry you .
 Why do you smell like smoke ?
 I was in Vegas .
 Vegas ?
 I 'm sorry . Vegas .
