 You know who 's got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe ? Whoever has to give She- Hulk a bikini wax .
 You want to talk brave , how about Captain America 's undocumented Mexican gardener ?
 He 's not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after the thing ?
 As usual , you 're all wrong .
 The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives wolverine his prostate exam .
 How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from wolverine ?
 Now you just being silly .
 Wolverine 's never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer .

 Hello .
 Yes , the elevator 's out of order£¬ you 'll have to use the stairs .
 Of course you can .
 Pizza dates back to the 16th century , while the first elevator was not installed until 1852 .
 That means that for over 300 years , people carried pizzas up stairs .
 Be part of that proud tradition .
 I 'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food .

 Do you think they gave wolverine an Adamantium prostate ? That 's a stupid question .
 We 're having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes .
 There are no stupid questions .

 Yes ?
 Oh , um , is Penny here ?
 You 're Leonard , right ?
 Yeah .
 Damn , it 's good to finally meet you , son .
 Okay , I think a bit of context here might help .
 Oh , hey , Leonard . I see you met my dad .
 Oh , good .
 Context .
 Come on in , buddy .
 Take a load off .
 Oh , gee , dad , Leonard can 't stay .
 He just dropped by to say hello .
 Thanks for stopping by , sweetie . I 'll see you later .


 Bye .

 That was odd .
 * Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state *
 * Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ...
 Wait ! *
 * The earth began to cool *
 * The autotrophs began to drool , neanderthals developed tools *
 * We built the wall , we built the pyramids *
 * Math , science , history , unraveling the mystery *
 * That all started with a big bang *
 * Bang ! *
 Are you sure you have enough comics ?
 You 're going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours , and by my estimate , you 've only selected seven hours of reading material .
 That 's even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms
 like " Bamf ! " and " Snikt ! "
 Is that racist ?
 It feels racist .

 Don 't be oversensitive .
 He 's calling you illiterate , not your race .
 Oh , okay .
 Good .
 I don 't need more comics .
 Howard 's gonna stop by , we 're gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly .
 I don 't care for novelty editions of Monopoly .
 I prefer the classics regular and Klingon .
 Actually , Indian Monopoly 's just like regular , except the money 's in Rupees , instead of hotels you build call centers , and when you pick a chance card , you might die of dysentery .

 Just FYl , that was racist .

 You 'll never guess what just happened .
 You went out in the hallway ,
 Stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5, 000 years into the future , where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine , and now you 're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins ?





 No .
 Aw .

 Penny kissed me .
 Well , who would ever guess that ?
 What ... what kind of a kiss ?
 A big kiss . On the mouth .
 Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip ?
 That happens with me and my mom all the time .
 She introduced me to her father , kissed me and then shut the door in my face .
 Maybe she was trying to send you a message .
 You think ? Yeah . " This man is not my father .
 I 'm being held hostage .
 So I 'm going to do something insane in the hopes that you 'll call 911 . "
 Penny kissing me is not insane .
 She used to kiss me all the time .
 Einstein defined insanity as " doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . "
 By that standard ,
 Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs .
 I 'm just saying , it felt like it may have meant something .
 Ah , this takes me back .
 Leonard obsessing about Penny .
 I mean , don 't get me wrong , I love your new stuff , but once in a while it 's nice to hear the hits .
 Ooh , ooh !
 Do " Our babies will be smart and beautiful . " That one always makes me laugh .
 Why do I bother talking to you people ?
 If it 'll make you feel better , we rarely listen .
 Hey , can I talk to you out here for a sec ?
 Yeah , sure .
 I 'm starting to think we 're never going to see that pizza .
 So you 're probably wondering what that was all about .
 What , uh , the kissing and everything ?
 Nah , women do that to me all the time .
 Yeah , okay .
 The thing is , I kind of told my father we got back together again .
 What ? Why ?
 Well , you 're the first guy he 's ever really approved of , you know ?
 You 're a scientist who went to college and you don 't have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or ... or a baby .
 What kind of guys did you used to go out with ?
 Just guys .
 Anyway , when I told him we split up , he was heartbroken , and he kept bugging me :
 " How 's Leonard ? why can 't you get back together with Leonard ?
 I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself . "
 So to get him off my back ,
 I told him we worked things out .
 Really ?

 How ... how 'd we manage that ?
 What ?
 I mean , did you apologize ?
 Did you have to woo me ?
 Get over yourself .
 I whistled , you came running .
 Yeah , no , I don 't think so .
 Okay , why are you arguing about this ?
 I 'm just saying , if we fake got back together , that 's totally not how it fake happened .
 Oh ... Okay , whatever . Will you please just play along until my dad leaves ?

 Hold on , you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham playacting and kissing ?
 Hold on , you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham playacting and kissing ?
 Cause I 'm good with that .
 Penny , you out here ?

 Come on , honey , not in front of my dad .
 Relax , I 've seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider .
 See ?
 He doesn 't mind .
 So , Leonard , I 'm taking your gal out for a steak dinner , you want to join us ?
 Oh , dad , that 's nice , but Leonard has to work .
 Right , Leonard ? Uh , I do , I have to work .
 But I 'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father , 'cause , you know , just the kind of boyfriend I am .
 Oh .
 Come here , you .

 C- 7 .
 Miss . How could that be a miss ?
 C- 6 was a hit , c- 8 was a hit .
 Part of your starship has to be on c- 7 .
 Not if it has a hole in the middle .
 What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle ?
 A romulan battle bagel ?

 Knock- knock .
 Oh , great , you made it . Come on in .
 I invited her .
 So where 's the telescope ?
 It 's in hawaii , but Raj controls it from here .
 He 's hoping to see epsilon eridani dim , which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it .
 So we just sit and stare at the screen , waiting for something to happen ?
 I did it with you when we rented " The Notebook " .

 Yes , Gena Rowlands is a treasure . You 'd better open up that bottle of wine or I 'm gonna end up with swimmer 's ear .

 Excuse me .
 I can 't be drinking , I 'm about to make an important scientific discovery here .
 What ? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine .

 How do you know that ? Well , he was Italian .
 It 's a reasonable assumption .
 Dude , can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype ?
 Oh , I ... I 'm sorry , Galileo drank diet sprite .
 Look , you 're my best friend , she 's my girlfriend , you should bond .
 You know , like you and my mom did .
 Your mom creeps the hell out of me .
 Yes , but she 's stopped calling you slumdog millionaire .
 I do appreciate that .
 Here we go .
 I 'd like to propose a toast .
 To science and friendship .
 Hold on .
 Wait .
 No , it 's okay , go ahead .
 What ? Oh , I was working with
 Penicillin- resistant gonorrhea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands .

 Thanks for the steak , Wyatt .
 My pleasure .
 It 's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny 's that knows how to use a napkin .
 So not funny , dad .
 Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with ,
 This ... this fella Donnie .
 Oh , will you please let it go ?
 Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government .
 A lot of people are doing that . Oh , see ?
 Yeah , but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom 's Camry .
 Yeah , that 's great .
 It 's a funny story . Moving on .
 And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the olympics .

 What was his name , sweetheart ?
 Curtis , and I 'm pretty sure he was joking .
 I don 't know .
 That petition looked real to me .
 Yeah , okay , I think this ends the ex- boyfriend portion of our evening .
 Well , I 'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper .
 Thanks , wyatt .
 I 'm a keeper .

 Leonard , you want to come in for a nightcap ?
 Oh , gee , dad , he 'd love to , but Leonard has to work in the morning .
 Maybe I could go in a little late .
 No , no , no , you can 't .
 Your career is far too important .
 Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won 't let him have any fun , am I right , Leonard ?
 Don 't I know it .

 Well , good night , son .
 Good night , Wyatt .
 Oh , good night , honey .
 Good night .
 I love you .

 Love you , too .

 Oh , friggety- frak .
 Not this again .

 Three , four , five ... pass go , get 2, 000 Rupees ... Six , seven .
 Whoops . Can 't go any further .

 There 's a sacred cow in my way .
 Bernadette , please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes .
 It won 't help .
 Once he finds a joke he likes , he sticks with it .
 Yeah .
 Like his haircut material .
 Oh , right .
 Did you get your hair cut ?
 " No .
 I got them all cut . "
 Which is still so funny .
 And when you go to a Chinese restaurant , he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie .
 Right .
 " Help , I 'm a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory . "

 Okay , I think that 's enough about me . He 's right .
 Let 's make fun of his mother .
 " Howard , come rub my feet !
 My corns are killing me ! "
 " Howard , help me out of the tub ! I 'm stuck again ! "

 Coming .

 Hey , lovebug .
 Shut up .
 You know what I 've been doing for the last hour ?
 Mm , dreamily doodling " Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter " in a notebook ?
 Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are .
 You got to admit , I am ...
 I 'm delightful .

 Why are you making this so difficult ? It 's not difficult for me .
 I 'm having fun .
 Leonard .
 What do you want me to do ?
 You started this .
 Do you want to go over and tell him we 're broken up ?
 - No . - Well , then , what do you want ?

 I don 't know .
 Don 't you think that 's something you should have figured out before you stomped over here ?
 Maybe .
 Leonard , Penny , excellent .
 I 'd like to say I 'm very happy that you 're back together , and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere , I will .
 In the meantime ,
 I 'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address
 Penny 's annoying personal habits .
 Oh , my God .
 - What personal habits ?
 - I have a list .
 FYl , overuse of the phrase " oh , my god " is number 12 .
 Okay , Sheldon , you don 't have to do this - because Leonard and I are not ... - Ba- ba- ba- ba .
 Are you sure you want to include him in this ?
 Include me in what ?
 Is there a plot afoot ?
 I 'll have no truck with plots .

 No , you 're right .
 No , there 's ...
 There 's no plots , no trucks , no feet . So what other annoying habits shall we discuss ?
 Uh , we don 't discuss anything .
 Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement .
 As such , he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines .
 - Fines ?
 - Yes .
 If Penny 's going to be spending nights here again , you 'll need to set up an escrow account .
 Sign here .

 Hello , Hawaii .
 This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena .
 I 'd like you to reposition the telescope , please .
 Scarlett Johansson 's house !
 I 'm kidding , Hawaii .
 Mahalo .
 Whoo !

 It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine .
 Well , live and learn .
 So , Raj , do you think this planet you 're looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life ?
 Maybe .
 If it did , I 'd be famous .
 I 'd be on the cover of magazines .
 And then , instead of living alone in my tiny apartment , I 'd have a big mansion .
 That sounds great .
 It is .
 If you like wandering around a big , empty house with no one to love you .

 - We 'd come visit you .
 - No , you wouldn 't .
 You 'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame .
 My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler .
 And the little people I hired to be my living chess set .
 He 's taking a turn to the dark side , isn 't he ? Hold on . He could come back .

 Oh , what 's the point of everything ?
 Nope . He 's gone .

 You know it 's been more than a year since i 've even kissed a girl ?
 What about that hookup at Comic- Con you told me about ?
 Oh , grow up .
 I was lying .
 I lie all the time .
 Nobody wants to kiss me .
 Oh , you poor , poor thing .
 Raj , you have to know you 're a wonderful man . There are a lot of girls out there who 'll want to kiss you .
 Where ?
 You just have to look .

 No !
 Well , this was fun .
 Oh !
 I think I got a nibble .
 Oh , be careful .
 Give him some line .

 Okay , now reel him in .
 Oh , look at that baby . They 're really biting , huh ?
 Yeah .
 They do that when you set it on easy .

 Oh , that 's me .

 Hello .
 Oh , hi , sweetie .
 Yeah , I got up early and didn 't want to wake you , so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back .
 Guess what ...
 We 're fishing . Yeah .
 Right here on his couch .
 Hey , baby .
 I love you !
 That 's Leonard says he loves you .

 What ?
 I see .
 The whole thing 's bull squirt , huh ?
 Well , that 's very disappointing .
 Bye .

 Oh , hey .
 There 's been something I 've been meaning to tell you .
 I can 't believe you would lie to me like that . Just for the record , I did not want to be a part of this .
 I 'll get to you in a minute .
 No hurry .
 That my own daughter thinks I don 't love her enough
 To support her no matter what choices she makes ...
 Well , that hurts me deeply .
 - I 'm sorry , daddy ... - Let me finish .
 Oh .
 I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes .
 Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri ?
 And the pee stick in your bathroom
 Is to check for diabetes ?
 You know , I 'm sorry .
 You 're a grown woman , and I respect your right
 To make your own decisions , but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them .
 You 're right .
 Look , from now on , I will tell you the truth .
 Thank you .
 Now , why don 't you go and put some clothes on and we 'll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport .
 - Now you . - Daddy , he had nothing to do ...
 - Keep walking .
 - Okay .

 Please , please , please don 't give up on her . What ?
 I can 't go back to the skateboard idiots , the white rappers and all those
 Sweaty dumb- asses with their backwards hats .
 Gee , I don 't know if it 's in the cards , sir . Then , stack the deck .
 Cheat . Lie .
 I don 't care .
 I want grandkids before I die , and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels .

 I 'll give it a shot .
 Thank you .
 Now I 'm going to do something here to help you along .
 - Excuse me ? - Just don 't panic .
 Now , get your sorry , lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again !
 Oh , the reverse psychology thing .
 I see . That 's very clever .
 Don 't yap .
 Just get out .

 I 'll friend you on Facebook .

 Oh , there you are .
 Just so you know , I was up all night , but I have finally completed
 The Penny- specific section of the new roommate agreement .
 Yeah , well , not necessary .
 We broke up again .

 Do you even think about other people , leonard ? Do you ?

 - Hey .
 - Oh , how 'd it go last night ? Oh , you know .
 Same old , same old .
 Looked through a telescope , saw some stars .
 Big whoop . Really ?

 You waited months for time with that telescope .
 What happened ? Why ? You writing a book ?



 I 'm going to propose a hypothesis . Last night , Raj accidentally made contact
 With an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government
 To keep it a secret . Nothing happened .
 Can we please just change the subject ?
 That sounds rehearsed .
 We are not alone .
 Hey .
 - Hey .
 - Hello .
 - Hey .
 - Hey .
 You get to play with raj 's big telescope last night ? Whoa .
 Where did that come from ?
 He never touched my telescope .
 Way to go shutting up .
 I did shut up . Now you shut up .
 - Fine .
 - Thank you .


 How come you didn 't call me this morning ?
