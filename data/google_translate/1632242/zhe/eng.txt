 00 : 00 : 03, 628 -- > 00 : 00 : 05, 582 All I 'm saying is , if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie , they could probably just make an actual Hulk .
 That is apt and amusing .
 I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler .
 She 'll appreciate the witticism .
 Thank you .
 It 'll also help improve her initial impression of you .
 So what 's going on with you two ?
 Well , the status is as it always was .
 She 's a girl . She 's a friend .
 She is not my -- please forgive me for doing this --
 " girlfriend . "
 Right , right .
 So you 're still just texting and emailing ?
 You don 't feel any need to hang out with her , you know -- be in the same room ?
 Leonard , you are my best friend .
 I 've known you for seven years , and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you .
 Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler .
 Got it .
 I sense judgment on your part .
 No , no .
 Maybe a little .
 May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy .
 Jealousy ? What do I have to be jealous of ?
 I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female .
 You have none .
 Oh , right .
 That .
 Jealousy is an ugly green- eyed monster -- not unlike the Hulk -- who , by the way , also has a girlfriend .
 In this iteration , Jennifer Connelly , whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in a feel- good romp if there ever was one .

 I 'm not jealous .
 Leonard not jealous .

 You know , it just occurred to me , if there are an infinite number of parallel universes , in one of them , there 's probably a Sheldon who doesn 't believe parallel universes exist .
 Probably .
 What 's your point ? No point .
 It 's just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle .
 What makes you chuckle , Leonard ?
 Hmm , recently ? Not much .
 Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair- bond with a woman , and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity ?


 Um ... Shut up .
 You know , when my grandfather died , and Meemaw was alone , my mom arranged for her to visit a center three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people .

 It 's very nice .
 They discuss current events , play bridge , get a hot meal .
 That sounds lovely .
 It is if you like bridge .
 Do you like bridge , Leonard ?
 Sheldon , I 'm just not dating someone right now .
 I don 't need to go to a senior center .
 Meemaw resisted at first , but now she loves it . Fine .
 If I don 't meet someone soon , you can put me in a home .
 It 's not a home . It 's a senior center .
 We 'd never put Meemaw in a home !
 Hey , guys .
 Hey . Hey .
 All right , I 'll bow to social pressure :
 Hey !
 Excuse me .
 That 's my girlfriend , Bernadette . I assigned her her own ringtone --
 " Bernadette , " by The Four Tops .
 Hello , Bernadette .
 When I call him , his phone plays " Brown Eyed Girl . "
 Which , now that
 I think about it , is not so good .
 You realize he 's just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend , and we don 't .
 You mean , don 't .
 You have a girlfriend ?
 How could you have a girlfriend ?
 You can 't even speak to women .
 Two words -- deaf chick .
 It doesn 't matter if I can 't talk , because she can 't hear me .
 What ?
 That 's what she said .

 Great .
 You have a girlfriend , Howard 's got a girlfriend , Sheldon 's got a girl ...
 No , no , no , no ! ... who 's a friend .
 Thank you .
 What about you , Stuart ?
 You have a girlfriend yet ?
 Oh , yeah . Yeah .
 I met her at Comic- Con , the one place in the world where saying " I own a comic bookstore " is an actual pickup line .

 Oh . Well , good for you .
 Not really . She 's horrible .
 When she wants to have sex , she puts on her plus- size Wonder Woman costume and shouts ,
 " Who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane ? "
 Why don 't you just break up with her ?
 No , no , I can 't . Why not ?
 ' Cause then I 'd be alone ,
 like you .
 Dude , why don 't you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz ?
 Because I don 't need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends .
 I 'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own .
 Oh , Leonard , you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women 's correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free .

 You 're saying I couldn 't get laid in a women 's prison with a handful of pardons .
 Are you going to let me tell the story or not ?
 Leonard ?
 Are you sleeping ?
 No . Are you ill ?
 No .
 Are you still depressed because you 're alone , and no one loves you ?
 I don 't know .
 Maybe .
 I want you to know that I 'm genuinely concerned about your well- being .
 Thank you . You 're welcome .
 But it 's still no reason to have your feet in my spot .
 May I offer an observation ?
 What the hell ?
 How long has she been here ? Since we got home from the comic bookstore .
 That was two hours ago .
 As per your suggestion , we 're hanging out .
 Quite frankly , I don 't see what all the hoopla 's about .
 Go on , Amy .
 From a neurobiological standpoint , Leonard , you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone- based stink of desperation .

 Did you know that , Leonard ?
 No . I did .
 I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns .
 Have you tried a bar or tavern ?
 No , I 'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar .
 Wise decision .
 You see , Amy , success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height , strength , attractiveness , the ability to hold one 's liquor and throw darts -- separately or together .
 Leonard has none of these attributes , right , Leonard ?

 Right .
 That 's not true of all bars . Juice bars , for example .
 Oh ! Good point , Amy .
 Yeah , building on your premise ,
 Leonard could frequent sushi bars , salad bars , oyster bars , the Apple Genius Bar ...
 What are you doing ? Keep going .
 I 'm listening .
 That was rude .
 He does it all the time .
 He 's a cornucopia of social awkwardness .
 Cornucopia .
 What a mellifluous word .
 Let 's make that our word of the day .
 Agreed .
 And we 'll use mellifluous tomorrow .
 Well , I have to void my bladder . It was nice spending this time with you .
 Wait .
 I have a request .
 Yes ?
 I 'd like you to meet my mother .
 I see .
 Can I get back to you on that ?
 Certainly . Good night .
 Good night .
 Leonard , Leonard , Leonard , Leonard , Leonard ,
 Leonard , Leonard , Leonard , Leonard , Leonard ,
 Leonard , Leonard , Leonard , Leonard , Leonard ,
 Leonard , Leonard ,
 Leonard , Leonard ...
 Yeah , what ?
 Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother .
 Yeah .
 So ?
 What does that mean ?
 Well , you know how you 're always saying that Amy is a girl who 's your friend , and not your girlfriend ?
 Uh- huh .
 You can 't say that anymore .
 Wait .
 What ?
 Look , she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level .
 I don 't want the next level .
 I like this level . Fix it for me !
 Me ?
 Well , how am I supposed to fix it ?
 Simple ! You want a girlfriend ,
 Amy wants to be someone 's girlfriend .
 Take her off my hands .
 I give you my blessing . That is insane .
 You 're right . It would never work .
 Amy finds you tedious .
 Okay , good luck .
 Wait !
 What am I supposed to do ?
 Well , have you considered telling her how you feel ?
 Leonard , I 'm a physicist , not a hippie .
 All right , well , let me see if I can explain your situation using physics .
 What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis ?
 Screwed .

 There you go .
 Amy 's right .
 He is tedious .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ : Howard , get the door !
 You know I 'm doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy !
 Why can 't you get it ?
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 I 'm like an upside- down volcano here .
 Oh , hey .
 I hope you didn 't hear that .
 The volcano thing ?
 No . What 's with the T- shirt ?
 You working at the Apple store now ?
 No , it 's just something I threw on .
 I know all your shirts .
 That 's not one of them ...
 You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women , weren 't you ?
 Yeah .
 Turns out , they guard the iPods , but they don 't guard the shirts .
 So , how 'd it go ?
 It was going well .
 I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode .
 The manager got suspicious , and , well , long story short , they really do have a little jail in the mall .
 Just FYl , don 't try to go back with a fake mustache .
 I mean , they may not really be geniuses , but they see right through that .
 I want to invoke the girlfriend pact , Howard . You that desperate ?
 No , I just ...
 I want what you have . You know , I want a woman in my life .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Holy Moses , how much liquid can be in one tokus ?
 To be clear , I meant like Bernadette , not your mother . Yeah , I know what you mean .

 Well , I 'm off to meet Bernadette 's friend .
 How do I look ?
 As if one of the plants from duplicated you in every way , only with an absurd amount of hair gel .
 What are you working on ?
 I 'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can 't find me and compel me to meet her mother .
 Ah .
 You 're going off the grid .
 Exactly .
 The old Unabomber approach . Kudos .

 Thank you .
 I 've also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e- mail address .
 What if she just comes over ?
 She 'll get lost .
 We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles .
 We now live at 311 Los Robles .
 You changed the address on the building ? What about mail ?
 Oh , no worries -- I explained my predicament to our letter carrier .
 He was sympathetic .
 His exact words were :
 " Got your back , Jack .
 Bitches be crazy . "
 Who is it ?
 Amy Farrah Fowler .
 Darn !
 She found me !
 She 's been here before .
 The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan .
 Now , get my back , Jack . What do you want to do ?
 Tell her I 'm not here .
 Okay , where are you ? I don 't know .
 You 'll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence , keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details .
 Hi , Amy .
 Sheldon 's not here .
 All right .
 Way to go on the details .
 Thanks again for doing this , Bernadette .
 Oh , I take pacts very seriously .
 One time at my lab , a petri dish of genetically modified super- virus went missing .
 That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold .
 Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold ?
 We never did .
 That would be a terrible , terrible thing .
 Hi .
 Sorry I 'm late -- I was at the gym .
 Spin class -- worked up quite a sweat .
 Joy , this is Leonard . Leonard , this is Joy . Hi .
 Hi .
 You don 't look like a genius .
 Go ahead , say something smart . Uh ...
 Aah ! Time 's up .
 Just kidding .
 First thing you need to know about me :
 I 'm hilarious .
 Yeah .
 So , Bernadette tells me she knows you from self- defense classes ?
 Yeah .
 Israeli Krav Maga . Lots of fun .
 Basically , a hundred different ways to rip a guy 's nuts off .
 Wow .
 Wouldn 't think there 'd be that many .
 Number 42 !
 Whoa !
 Isn 't she a pip ?
 Proxima Centauri 's the nearest star .
 The celestial bodies that follow are
 Alpha Centauri A , Toli ,
 Barnard 's Star ,
 Wolf 359 ...
 Lalande 21185 ,
 Sirius A , Sirius B ,
 BL- Ceti , UV- Ceti ,

 Ross 248 ...
 Epsilon Eridani ,
 Lac- 9352 ,
 Ross 128 ,
 Procyon A ...
 Oh , darn , that 's wrong !
 EZ Aquarii A ,
 EZ Aquarii B ,
 EZ Aquarii C ,
 Procyon A.
 Those are the stars that are nearest to me .
 Tra- la- la and fiddle- dee- dee .
 Oh , dear .
 They really do be crazy .
 This lobster 's good on the way down and the way up .
 Should be -- it 's $30 a pound .
 Hey , this is a date , right ?
 Yep , it is . 73 !
 Whoa !
 Excuse me , I have to go to the little girls ' room ... and take a wicked whiz .
 I 'll go with you .
 Fair warning -- I had the asparagus .
 My pea is gonna stink up the place .
 I think she likes you .
 EZ Aquarii B ...
 EZ Aquarii C ...
 Excuse me , madam .
 Sheldon ? Rats !
 I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother .
 No misunderstanding .
 I 've learned what that request actually means , and I don 't want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis .
 In what way are you screwed ?
 All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she 'll be satisfied that I 'm in a relationship .
 So we 'd be perpetrating a ruse ?
 Precisely .
 And you haven 't fallen hopelessly in love with me ?
 Don 't be absurd .
 I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships .
 Amy Farrah Fowler , that 's the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me .
 I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy- slash- friend- slash - girl- slash- friend status .
 Of course .
 Would you like to join me for Chinese food ?
 Sheldon , please , you 're suffocating me .
 My apologies .
 Good night , Amy . Good night , Sheldon .
 Come on , just give her a chance .
 Maybe she 'll grow on you .
 Or maybe she 'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off .
 There are still 93 ways she hasn 't tried yet .
 Look , H- Howard , I appreciate the effort , but this is , like , the worst date of my life .
 Seriously ?
 I was once robbed by a pre- op transsexual I met on J- Date , and that didn 't even crack my top ten .
 I guess the difference is , I have some self- respect .
 Not that I 've ever seen .
 It 's relatively new .
 I just know that
 I 'm not gonna spend time with someone I don 't like simply to have a girlfriend .
 I 'm okay on my own .
 Good news -- I made lots of room for dessert .
 Look , uh , Joy , it was nice to meet you , but ...
 Yeah , you , too . Hey , you got anything for next weekend ?
 I need a date for my cousin 's wedding . You 're asking me out ?
 Yeah .
 And it 's an open bar , so I 'll probably be giving it away .
 I look forward to it .
 MRS. FOWLER It 's nice to meet you , too , Sheldon .
 I honestly didn 't believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend .
 I assure you I am quite real and I 'm having regular intercourse with your daughter .
 What ? Oh , yes .
 We 're like wild animals in heat .
 It 's a wonder neither of us has been hurt .
 Amy ... what is he saying ? You wanted me to have a boyfriend , Mother .
 Well , here he is .
 Have to sign off now .
 My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins .
 Oh , yes , it 's time for me to make love to your daughter 's vagina .
 Thank you , Sheldon , that went very well .
 Agreed .
 Amy , I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship .
 Bazinga .
 Bedtime .
 Please show yourself out .
