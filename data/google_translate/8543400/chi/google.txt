You are smart, beautiful, educated, and kind. You turn 21 today.
Anyone would be proud to be your father, but your father is none other than

it 's me
Can 't believe I 'm so lucky
Happy 21st Birthday Jing Taimi
Thanks, Dad, but you don 't have to be so exaggerated.
Made me so embarrassed in front of Maddie
no, i like it, go on
Forgive me, Maddie
Baby girl is not every 21st birthday
OK




May your first year of adulthood lead you on the road to become the amazing woman you were destined to be
I love you, Taimi
I 'm going to vomit if you keep talking.
And I 'm an adult at 18, Dad, really!
You just turned 21, right, Maddie?
Yes, three months ago
I hope your dad doesn 't embarrass you with this sentimental old man
- why? - he didn 't

It 's my 21st birthday
The way I celebrate my dad won 't necessarily agree
But it 's not bad, because he 's not there
I 'm so used to not having a dad
I don 't even think of him that often
We should use standard CBT . . .
Until someone reminded me of him - all the time - in theory . . .
This guy
His sweater is forever in crumbs
His sideburns are adorned with a little grey hair
The top of his hair is a little thin
But he 's also handsome
like some actor playing dad in a retirement society ad
. . . it depends on it
Basically he 's a super dad
His only problem is that his belly is not big enough
The so-called perfect dad state, his stomach needs to touch his knees
I thought of a way
I 'm going to bake cookies and put them in the pantry, pass on


Chocolate Chip or Oatmeal
I knew he would choose chocolate chips
I just know it

He looks like Dad. It 's just a dinner, right?

I used every excuse to stay outside his office
Of course he loves classical music
like all confident robotic geniuses
I 'm looking for a reason to come into his office
look at his desk, his library
Maybe he even put a potted plant?
Photos from the past?
Hello?

Hi, what 's the matter?
it 's about music
- Is it too loud? - no
just curious whose music
Yo-Yo Ma
Bach Suite for Cello Unaccompanied
do you like it?
like very much
OK
I want a cup of coffee with some milk
- hi- hi
You made those chocolate chip cookies
was discovered
I ate it all and made me fat, Madeleine

Only my dad can call me by my full name
People usually call me Maddie
do you love coffee? I love coffee too
Do you love duck meat?
Who doesn 't love duck meat?
Do you want to have dinner together another day?

The company has a senior engineer who studies artificial intelligence

What an underwater drone that can collect ocean data, measure salinity, carbon content, and other geniuses

sounds cool
I 'm having dinner with him tonight
- Sounds super weird- No, it 's nothing

- How to say? - He 's almost 30 years older than me
It doesn 't stop them
I do, but he 's really super old
He 's exactly like my dad, even tastes like
Do you still smell him?

I sent the papers to his desk I leaned against him and smelled the faint smell of an old man
same as my dad
There 's something like this, old man 's taste
to check
they will make more benzothiazole and nonanal
Nonanal?
a metabolite
real or fake

He still smells of anti-gastric calcium tablets
he may have digestive problems

Could it be because of this that I won 't get fat, I don 't know
So what 's up tonight? Where are you having dinner?
his home
Does he cook? That 's dating!
not dating
Then why are you ironing?
I iron clothes every day
Since when?
from now on
Well, Maddie, say what you want
Anyway don 't go to bed if it 's not a date or it will become a . . . date

- Let 's just say it 's not a date- Okay

it was a date
But it 's a date with my dad
listen to his question
Madeleine, do you like to travel?
What dreams do you have for your future self?
Why have you been in the R&amp;D department?
It 's just a question my dad would ask.
You always look like that in meetings
It 's like watching the human comedy in front of you and taking notes on the novel you wrote
You are an observer, always watching everything
Like right now, I 'm watching you cook
I 'm glad you came
I 'm not sure if you will come
come, try this stew
It should be dense and a little tasteful, blow it

be careful


very dense
That 's definitely a date
go home after dessert
take it easy
Peter?
here

hey come here
I want you to hear this
Schumann wrote to his wife before he went mad
He smells of wine and tangerine and has a solid taste

His sheets are grey
He 's the grey sheet
I 'm all fluttering
very nice
I knew you would like it

Can you play golf?
No, what 's wrong?
You have little greens on top of your socks
Have it?
yes, you see

frighten you
wait a minute, don 't litter
- why? - i like your socks
I 'm more comfortable
How can you be more comfortable?



tell me stories
What kind of story?
my childhood story
You were little . . . I didn 't know you at that time
Yes, but what if you knew each other?
I 'm playing with you, it 's just a game
OK, what game?
Just . . . you pretend to be my dad
your dad? I pretend to be your dad?
you want to play
What about your real dad?
Died when I was 11
Unfortunately
Then you want me to . . .
Nope, don 't if you think it 's weird
- Forget it- it 's a little weird

Forget it, stop playing
long long ago
do not do that
there is a little girl
She has big blue eyes and short blond hair and her name is Madeleine

Okay, stop talking, please, it 's embarrassing
I drank too much, a whole super idiot
What happened?
I celebrated her birthday with a friend last week and her dad was there and he said a lot of 'I 'm so proud of you'
'You are a wonderful young woman
'You will make your dreams come true
'Everything will be fine'
I 'm totally overwhelmed
No one ever said that to me
After that, I went crazy
I am sorry
Will not
hey i get it
you understand?
how come?
because i 'm a dad
real or fake?

several?
two
How old are you?
They are bigger than you

gosh
let 's go
My genius and I maintained a friendly but distant relationship for the next few weeks

I 'm surprised I miss him so much
Luckily I still have his golf socks
I took my socks home the night of the stew
I found that these socks make me sleep better
My genius did say that night that he understood me
'It 's okay, I understand'
he said so
maybe i need to meet him again

You look so sad, why don 't you smile?
You look better when you smile
I have no obligation to make you look good, this big brother
It 's my business whether to laugh or not
So it 's not bad for you to be ugly?
Can 't you watch the road well and drive quietly?
There 's no need for that tone, I just want to express kindness
careful!


My Uber driver kindly arranged a crash for me and I knew exactly who I wanted to call

Officer, can she go?
I want to take her to the emergency room for a checkup
Emergency? no need
You may have a concussion, better get checked
Just listen to your dad this time, you can go
Thank you, officer, let 's go
It 's nice to see you, even in this situation
thank you for coming
I 'm glad you called me
I 'm surprised but happy
I miss you
Me too

I don 't really need an MRI
I didn 't touch my head
But Peter showed me full of fatherly love and I felt obligated to quell his fears
And the MRI doesn 't hurt at all.
- Are you claustrophobic? - Super, I panic in small spaces

I 'm here with you
can you grab my feet?
Of course, I 'll hold your feet all the way
If my toes are tucked in, it means I 'm scared, okay?
Well, if your toes curl up I 'll know you 're scared
I 'll rub your toes and let you know it 'll be alright

everything will be ok
I love that MRI
That was the best 45 minutes of my life
The next two or three weeks my genius will help me with all my problems big and small
- to you - thank you
He 's like a dream dad
Is it your poo stuck in there?
do you believe it?
can 't believe, can 't believe
- he 's awesome- really
I want too
you yourself
get it

My genius and I started dating weekend out
Somehow he just knew what to do
this goat . . .

- Sounds like a human - oh my god, that 's too exaggerated

I pretended to be weak
To ask Peter to buy me marshmallows
Even for me, it 's too much
He also gave me a sea lion doll
Grandpa! Grandpa!

Let 's go
Why are you pulling me away?
Let 's go there to see the monkeys
Are you hiding from that kid?
what are you talking about?

Wow, it 's Jonathan Yeh! Hello!
How did you come to the zoo? Didn 't call to tell us
Yeah, it 's weird for me to come here, I didn 't expect it
I 'm Maddie, Peter 's colleague
I 'm Leslie
leslie is my daughter

Are you going to work on Sunday too?
Yeah, super inhuman
The company is pushing too hard, it 's ruthless
So you guys decided to come to the zoo to rest, wow
Wonderful!
- it 's full of weird - yeah

you have a sea lion
yes, that 's right
can i hold it?
I love him
Well, my dear, it 's time to pay back
do not want! I do not want
No need to pay it back, just give it to him
It 's okay, right?

Right?
Yes, of course, send it to you
- say thank you - thank you

Listen, I have to go back to work at the company
Well, say goodbye to Grandpa, Jonathan
Grandpa high fives

OK, see you another day, Jonathan
Let 's have brunch next Saturday, right? Or are you going to work?

see you then
Okay
- break off, boy - break
- Break- I 'm going to see the alligator


Crocodile. . .




I love everything just now
really?
i thought you . . .
I thought you wouldn 't like the 'Grandpa' part
What are you kidding? I love that part
I love everything just now
Except for stealing my sea lion
I 've named him Mr. Sea Lion.

I am sorry

OMG! So beautiful
- The colors are beautiful - come on

- So stylish, right? - you need a good coat
You will catch a cold when you wear it now
this one i can
do you want it?
This one costs $395
So do you want it?
Can 't believe I own this coat
i love it
- Come on, do me a favor - what?
- come, come - what?
listen to me, put your hat on
Oh my god
you are so cute
what the fuck are you doing?
how? are you angry?
- How was that just now? - a kiss
I thought there was something between us I thought you liked me
- Not the kind of like - Really?
- I 'm surprised. . .
- You are 30 years older than me
Are you going to use your age to attack me now?
You seduced me for weeks, Madeleine
- I? seduce you? - right
I 've been hinting at you
imply what? What have you been implying to me?

Use words and attitudes to imply that you are careful not to hurt you I am not that kind of you
What are you thinking about?
Can you calm down? Do you look like you 're completely irresponsible?
In bed with me?
- That 's a snuggle - you call that a snuggle?
You 're pressing your chest against me, don 't tell me you don 't
OMG! I didn 't do it on purpose or what would I do with them?
They 're just ahead, I don 't mean it at all
What kind of snuggle is that?
father and daughter
'Father and daughter kind'?
So I 'm your dad?
we discussed this topic
You should grow up, this is not healthy
Is it healthy to have someone 40 years younger than you?
40 years old? Where did 40 years old come from?
I just accepted the gorgeous coat from me, so the hostility is too heavy
very good
Can 't believe you reduced our relationship to a cold blooded deal
What 's the matter, put your coat on the bed?
What are you kidding?
Is this a deal?
- what are you doing? - no, take it
- do not do that. . .
- pay you back
I 'm sorry, I said something I shouldn 't have said
I want you to take this coat
It 's not a deal, of course not
- you 're freezing, put it on - don 't
I don 't want to touch this coat again to your coat
So, can you wear mine?
The situation is a little out of control
I didn 't mean that, I just...

I feel so stupid, okay?
stupid me
You buy a coat for me, of course not because you are nice
Not because I need it, not because . . . not because you want to take care of me
How could I think that would be enough for you?
I don 't know, Madeleine, in your experience...
Is this enough for a man?
I have no idea
I. . .
I have no experience with men
I don 't know what it 's like to have a man who takes care of himself unconditionally
That 's because your expectations are too high if you really think you can maintain a platonic relationship
I mean, what does he get out of it?
I
all me
other than sex
Are you sure you don 't want to sleep with the old man?
I 'm not interested in him, please, Taimi
You said it was weird
It 's weird, but who cares?
good and bad
And the small light in the house is broken and needs someone to fix it
Can you really not give him another chance?
I close my eyes and try to feel comfortable having sex with my genius

I work hard

Comfortable? Like it?
You are super hot, you...
don 't talk, okay?
But I can 't imagine sleeping with him
I just don 't have that desire for him
I decided to let go of my genius completely

Madeleine
What 's up?
Is it convenient to go out and talk?

What 's up?
I have something important to tell you
omg i got fired
- what? - I got fired, you want me to leave the company
- right? right? - Wait a moment. . .

Usually this is the case
i trouble you
You try to get me out of your sight and I 'll get a bad performance appraisal company and I 'll find out I 've been printing stuff
then fried me
listen, no such thing
really?
real
Both of us are responsible
I don 't blame you all
won 't try to get you away
okay?
listen
I 'm talking to you because I want to . . .
tell you . . .
I 'm leaving
What?
I 'm leaving
i want to take a break
What? so suddenly?
I happened to have the opportunity to arrange a vacation
Because of me?
right
- I 'm sorry, I never . . .
- don 't be sorry
don 't be sorry
- I never . . .
- I know

This got me thinking a lot
I think. . .

are you crying?
Wouldn 't it be weird to cry at your age?
Why can 't I cry? Why can 't I have emotions?
Just because I 'm old?
The idea that adults won 't get hurt is bullshit
Everyone is the same, try to figure it out
I am really sorry
I have something to tell you and I want you to listen carefully, Madeleine
OK
I want you to know that . . .
you are a great girl
Smart
smart and pretty
You will surely achieve . . . the dream you set your mind to fulfill
You have grown into a fine young woman
You are the daughter every father dreams of having
I 'm very, very proud of you, Madeleine

At that moment, something changed
Watch my genius go away
I feel relieved and my heart is torn
His words have transformative power
Suddenly, I finally grew up
Wait a moment!
