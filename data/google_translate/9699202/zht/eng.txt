 [ " Skinhead Moonstomp " by Symarip playing ]

 - Ow ! Sorry ! Sorry .
 - Oh !
 Uh ...
 Did I do something wrong ?
 No .
 It 's not you , it 's me . I have something called vaginismus .
 My vagina 's like a Venus flytrap .
 If it makes you feel any better , I 've got one hairy nipple .
 Can you cure it , the vaginismus ?
 Apparently , if I 'm patient ,
 I 'll eventually be able to get the big one in , but for now , I can just get little Thumbelina up there .
 Do you know why you have it ?
 I think it 's because I put too much pressure on myself .
 So , you can 't even wank then ?
 No , I do . [ laughs ] I do .
 I just keep to the outside .
 For some reason , if I 'm touching myself , then I 'm okay .
 I have an idea .
 [ both moaning ]
 [ moaning continues ]
 [ moaning ]
 I 'm coming !
 [ both panting ]
 [ laughing ]


 [ grunts ]
 [ sighs ]
 Good morning .
 Good morning .
 You know , Dad 's still in the UK .
 He 's on his book tour .
 Can we talk about this , please ?
 Are you going to admit that you lied ?
 [ scoffs ]
 Then I guess we have nothing to talk about .
 [ Otis ] Withholding of information is not technically a lie .
 And implementing an avoidance strategy will only suppress your negative emotions towards me , not make them dissipate .
 Oh , you 're going to therapize me . Go ahead .
 Have a seat .
 Show me your skills .
 I 'm all ears .
 I think your overreaction to this situation stems from your deep- rooted fear of rejection .
 You 've rejected Jakob , now you 're rejecting me .
 You didn 't exactly accept Jakob .
 In fact , you made it incredibly difficult for us .
 So , is your son 's inability to form an attachment with your ex- boyfriend the real reason you 're so angry ?
 No .
 I 'm angry because my son is involved in a highly unethical underground operation on school campus .
 And he is refusing to take ownership for the severity of his actions .
 Fine . Okay , yes , I spoke to people at school .
 I gave out some advice .
 You can 't arrest me for talking to people .
 You don 't invoice for a casual conversation .
 It 's wrong , Otis .
 Well , I don 't think it is .
 I don 't understand , Mum .
 We usually just talk these things through and everything 's fine .
 Why are you still so upset with me ?
 Because I thought I was raising you to be a man who took responsibility for his actions .
 And because , as the primary carer in your life ,
 I always get your worst .
 And I 'm tired of it .
 It 's not my fault Dad left .
 You 're going to be late .
 Are you still coming to see Eric 's play tonight ?
 I 'm not exactly welcome on campus at the minute .
 [ sniffs ]
 You shouldn 't let them bully you .
 [ door opens , closes ]
 [ sobbing ]
 Oh .
 Ow .
 [ humming ]
 Oh , I 've packed some clean clothes and a couple of dinners for your father .
 Would you drop them over at school ? Please ?
 For me .
 - Did you tell him about me getting fired ?
 - No .
 But someone probably will .
 Might be best to mention it .
 You 'll find something you 're really good at soon .
 No . No , no , no , no .
 Oh , oh , okay . No , no , no , no . Not today .
 Not today .
 - Okay ?
 - [ door opens ]
 - Where have you been ? - I was outside having a fag .
 Okay , well , you can 't leave her on her own because she 's three .
 Ugh , she 's fine .
 Oh , my God . There you go .
 Actually , I need you to take her after school .
 I 've got a job interview .
 Well , I can 't , can I ? I 've got the NSQC finals .
 - I thought you were coming . - Oh , shit . I totally forgot .
 [ chuckles ]
 I can 't make it . Will they video it ?
 Yeah , it 's on telly . That 's the whole point .
 It 's fine . Um , it 's stupid anyway . I 'll take her to Cynthia 's .
 Everything 's dirty . Why haven 't you washed her clothes ?
 Just put her in her fairy costume .
 Okay , fairy costume ! Yeah !
 Here we go .
 Well done . That 's it .
 - [ Elsie ]
 Uh- oh .
 - [ Maeve ]
 Uh- oh .
 Well , don 't you look fancy .
 Come on then .
 [ Elsie babbles ]
 - [ Maeve ] Be good . - She reminds me of you as a kid .
 Always making trouble .
 - Why am I in trouble ? - You 're not in trouble , Jeffrey .
 I said Maeve used to cause trouble when she was little .
 You pissed on our doorstep once .
 Sorry .
 Well , your mum was never around to look after you , was she ?
 But that 's all changed now , hasn 't it ? Thank God .
 - Yeah . - Yeah .
 Bye , Els .
 You need to de- wax your ears , Jeffrey .
 [ whispers ] Twat .
 Isaac , Body Slammer 's here .
 I think my mum is using again .
 Don 't say I told you so .
 I wouldn 't dream of it .
 I need you to do me a favor .
 - Hey . - Hey .
 - When will I see you play this ?
 - Oh , well , if you come to the musical tonight , I 'm in the band .
 - I thought it was a play .
 - No .
 Uh ...

 [ Rahim ]
 This poster is very ugly .
 Don 't you think it looks like they 're in a forest full of dicks ?
 [ laughs ]
 I hate musicals . No ! You can 't hate musicals .
 People who hate musicals have no soul .
 - What about - I liked it .
 Uh- huh .
 - Until they started singing . - Oh , my gosh .
 Okay , well , you don 't have to come tonight .
 No , it 's okay .
 I 'll see it for you .
 Okay .
 - But please , I was a true lush and my ... - Stop it , Quentin .
 We have been over this . You are not Romeo ,
 - you will never be my Romeo . - Oh , enough , Quentin .
 You 're always there , all right ? Just fuck off !
 Okay , guys , this is it . Opening night .
 Woo !
 This is what we 've been working for . Hugo , stay off the drugs .
 Florence , pick up some props .
 - I 'm getting into character , sir .
 - You can get into character whilst helping Jackson with the octopus arms .
 Are you nervous about tonight ?
 Nerves are for amateurs .
 [ bell ringing ]
 Hey .
 - Are you going to the play tonight ? - Oh , yeah . Maybe after the finals .
 I forgot that was today . Good luck .
 How do I get you to not be angry at me anymore ?
 I 'm not angry , Otis . I 'm disappointed .
 [ indistinct comment ]
 Hey .
 I didn 't think you 'd wanna speak to me again .
 I don 't think you should drink alcohol for a really long time .
 - I didn 't mean to hurt you .
 - Well , you did .
 But it 's okay .
 Why do I always end up pissing everyone off ?
 I think you 're always trying so hard to be a good guy that you end up not being a good guy .
 Like you 're afraid you 'll turn into your dad or something .
 I think you might be right .
 Thank you .
 For what ? Where are you going ?
 [ Miss Sands ] Remember , guys , today is about having fun .
 Cube away , Dex !
 But it 's also really important that we win .
 This is not a drill , guys . This is the endgame .
 Understood ?
 Wait . I made these for you . Oh .
 Thanks , Aimes .
 - What 's with the rogue " R " ?
 - I had an extra cupcake .
 Oh , thanks .
 It 's a picture of your face when it 's concentrating .
 Good luck . See you there .
 Is she trying to tell me something ?
 Yeah , I think she 's saying , " I still love you , Steve , but I need some more time . "
 - [ knock at door ]
 - [ door opens ]
 Mum said to call if you want anything else .
 - All right , bye . - How is your mother ?
 Do you think she misses me ?
 I don 't know , Dad .
 I think Madam misses you though .
 [ chuckles ]
 I was thinking I could come back to school .
 I know I 've missed out on a lot , but I want to find something I 'm good at .
 I don 't want to work in that shop forever .
 [ sighs ]
 Well , you haven 't been fired yet .
 Wonders never cease .
 - Mm- hmm .
 - Let 's see , shall we ?
 Adam , you can go now .
 Adam ! Get out !
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 Hi , Adam .
 How are you ?
 My mum 's divorcing my dad , so he 's sleeping in the school .
 Yeah , everyone kind of knows . [ chuckles ]
 I got fired from my job .
 Yeah . [ chuckles ] Rahim told me .
 Sorry , man .
 Still play the French horn ?
 I didn 't think you knew what it was .
 [ laughs ]
 Trombone sounded funny .
 - [ man ] Eric , we 're starting . - [ chuckles ]
 It 's the final rehearsal for the musical tonight .
 [ bell ringing ]
 You should come . I mean ,
 - I 'm sure musicals aren 't your ting , but ... - Is it like
 Because that was very sad .
 Yeah . Uh ... [ laughs ] It 's a bit like
 It ... kind of looks like they 're snogging in a forest full of dicks .
 [ Eric ] That 's exactly what I said !
 [ Eric , laughing ] It 's a forest full of dicks , man !
 - It 's full of dicks ! - It 's just mad .
 [ Eric laughing ]
 - I , uh ... I better go . - [ Eric chuckles ]
 Yeah .
 Um ...
 I didn 't mean what I said at the party ... about people not liking you .
 I ...
 I 'm very easy to not like .
 [ sighs ]
 I , uh ...
 I understand that I hurt you .
 Okay .
 I just wanted you to know that .
 [ doctor ]
 Well , I 've been feeling very tired and sort of heavy .
 And I 've had this intermittent tight ... feeling around my chest .
 And , um , have there been any big life changes recently ?
 I 've , um , had some trouble at work , and , uh , well , my teenage son is ...
 Well , yes .
 Well , he 's a teenager .
 And things ended with a man I was seeing but , you know , just ordinary , manageable life stuff .
 When did you break up with your partner ?
 Uh , he wasn 't my partner , and I didn 't break up with him .
 I ... Well , I might have pushed him away .
 Um ...
 And then I realized my mistake , and ...
 I tried to make it right , but apparently , it was too late .
 Oh .
 There 's the feeling .
 And did this pain start when this man broke things off with you ?
 I mean , I 'd ... Yes , I might have noticed the symptoms around that time , but ... [ inhales deeply ]
 ... perimenopause causes surges in adrenaline , right ? And ...
 I think you might be suffering from a broken heart .
 Well , that 's ridiculous .
 I 'm a sex and relationship therapist , I 'm sure I 'd know if I was ... suffering from a broken heart .
 And I 've been a GP for over 20 years and not long ago ,
 I was hospitalized for a kidney infection I didn 't think I had .
 Right .
 Let 's get some tests done and put your mind at ease .
 in his innate masculinity .
 [ Remi ]
 How do we reclaim that pride ?
 I believe it starts with taking ownership of ourselves .
 How can we ever begin a romantic relationship without first owning our own emotions ?
 The answer is ... we can 't .
 The first rule of owning oneself is to live in the moment and practice the power of intention . "
 Thank you .
 This guy is so full of shit .

 Thanks .
 - Hi . Name ? - Ben .
 Ben .
 - There you go . Hi , what 's your name ? - Hey , Dad .
 Otis , uh , shouldn 't you be in school ?
 Yeah , I was , um ... I was hoping we could talk about something .
 Yeah , of course . Just take a seat for half an hour . Yeah .
 - Could I grab a photograph , Dr. Milburn ? - Yes . Of course .
 - [ girl ] Brilliant , thank you . - [ Remi ]
 Thank you .
 [ man 2 ] Hi , Remi . That was fantastic .
 Good job .
 Thank you very much .
 Hey .
 [ camera shutter clicks ]
 Hey , Erin . Erin , have you seen my pet rabbit ? It 's gone missing .
 - No , I 've not seen him . - It 's a her , actually .
 Did you know that female rabbits are called does , and ...
 - male rabbits are called bucks ? - No , didn 't know that .
 - Yeah . It 's all in this book called ...
 - I 'm in a bit of a rush .
 [ sighs ]
 I just came back to get my cigarettes . I 'm sorry , babe .
 - It 's a really good book . - That 's weird .
 I could have swore I locked that .
 Fuck .

 Now ...
 Hope you find your rabbit .
 Thank you kindly .
 They 're here .
 That 's Holly Crankshaw , their team captain .
 She already won this competition when she was 14 .

 [ phone chimes ]
 All right . Let 's go .

 Yeah , hello . Hi , um ...
 I need to report a child at risk .
 Yeah .
 Her parent is using drugs , and she 's unfit to care for her .
 - We 're on in five minutes , Maeve .
 - Yeah , I 'll be there in a sec .
 Yeah .
 Yeah , it 's my mother .
 [ sniffs ]
 The release of Dr. Milburn 's notes was quite serious .
 I can assure you we have the situation completely under control .
 Ms. Milburn has been removed from campus , and our students are no longer at risk .
 She was on campus to help us protect our students .
 You managed to somehow make a dire situation worse .
 That was an unfortunate blip .
 We are still a school that prides itself on excellence .
 But ... [ clears throat ] ... our best and brightest students are competing at the NSQC finals today , and you must stay for the first performance of
 tonight .
 It 's going to be quite an event .
 Is it just me , or does that forest look like it 's full of penises ?

 [ quiz master ]
 Good afternoon and welcome to the grand live final of the National Student Quiz Championship .
 On my left , we have three- time previous champions , it 's the Knowledge Knights .
 [ audience cheering ]
 And on my right , fierce competitors and wild cards , it 's the Quiz Heads .
 [ audience cheering ]
 Let 's get straight down to it with a round on Art History .
 So , question one ...
 [ Remi ] Here you go , one lemonade .
 So ... what 's this all about then , son ?
 More girl trouble ?
 Why did you leave ... when I was a kid ?
 Oh , your ... your mother and I were unhappy , and ...
 Not why did you leave Mum , why did you leave me ?
 What 's this really about ?
 This is what this is really about , Dad .
 I thought everything was Mum 's fault .
 That she was the reason I feel ... confused .
 But at least she 's there for me .
 Where were you ?
 Well , I- I had to move to America for work ...
 No , you moved to America for yourself .
 Dad , please just stop lying .
 Hey , I have a feeling there might be some ... some inner conflict going on here .
 Yes , I feel angry ... all the time , and I 'm trying to find out what kind of man I want to be , which is really hard when my dad has been absent for most of my life .
 Did you not like me as much as you thought you would ?
 Of course I like you . I just ...
 Then how could you leave me ?
 [ sighs ]
 Because I 'm an arsehole .
 I 'm sure there are multiple ways of diagnosing my personality , but the chief ingredient is arsehole .
 How do I not become an arsehole ?
 Just try and stay honest .
 ' Cause once you start lying , it 's ... it 's very hard to stop .
 You know , when you 're young ... you think that everybody out there really ... really gets you .
 But , you know , actually , only a handful of them do .
 All the people who like you , despite your faults .
 And then if you discard them , they will never come back .
 So , when you meet those people ... you should just hold on to them .
 Really , really tightly .
 And don 't let them go .
 [ Remi sighs ]
 And whatever else you do , never read this fucking book .
 Hi , sorry . Could you ... could you sign my book ?
 - Yeah . - [ man ] Oh , great .
 Thanks .
 - What 's your name ? - Pete .
 Pete . Hi , Pete .
 - Here you go . - Thank you . Big fan .

 [ quiz master on TV ]
 Hey , Maeve .
 I know you can 't answer this right now because I 'm watching you on live TV .
 But I wanted you to know how proud of you I am .
 And how unbelievably stupid I 've been .
 - Is your uncle here ? - Yusef .
 I know you like my boyfriend .
 You make him laugh .
 He doesn 't laugh like that with me .
 [ approaching footsteps ]
 See you later , Yusef .
 She 's still sitting . You taught her well .
 If you give me my job back , I can teach her other things .
 How to give a high- five or do a sexy wink .
 Please , I know I made a mistake . It won 't happen again .
 [ Ola ] Hello .
 Hi .
 - Why 're you dressed like a very small man ? - Oh , I 'm going to my school musical .
 Can I have my pay ?
 - What are you doing here ?
 - Trying to get my job back .
 I want to go back to school , but my dad can 't find out I was fired .
 What happened to the shop wasn 't Adam 's fault .
 The key wasn 't working last time I used it .
 I forgot to tell you . It was my fault .
 If you 're gonna fire him , you 're gonna have to fire me too .
 This is true ?
 - Yeah . - Yeah .
 Well , then you 're both fired .
 Go on , get out of my shop . Go !
 [ Ola sighs ]
 Why did you do that ?
 Because I love you , dude .
 Well , I know that I 'm bisexual , but I don 't like you like that .
 I thought you were a lesbian now or into kitchen stuff - or some shit ?
 - No , Adam , you idiot .
 You 're my friend . I love you like a friend .
 Are you okay ?
 No one 's ever said I was their friend before .
 [ Ola gasps ]
 You can put me down now .
 - Five hundred and sixty kilometers .
 - Is the right answer .
 In which city is the world 's busiest airport ?
 - Atlanta , Georgia , USA . - Correct .
 Which country is home to two cities that have a population of over one million , but whose names are anagrams of one another ?
 - [ bell rings ]
 - [ inaudible answer ]
 - [ whispers ]
 It 's Japan . - [ quiz master ] No conferring .
 [ mouthing ]
 [ buzzer ] I 'm sorry .
 I 'm going to have to dock you five points and pass the question over to the Knowledge Knights .
 [ buzzer ]
 - Japan . - Can you name the two cities ?
 Tokyo and Kyoto .
 Is absolutely right , and that 's the end of this round .
 We 'll see you after these messages .
 [ audience cheering ]
 [ sighs ]
 They 're destroying us .
 Uh , maybe we should just give up .
 We 're not giving up . We came here to win .
 And if we 're not gonna win , at least we 're gonna fight .
 Do you understand me ? Like , we are the Quiz Heads , and we are exceptional .
 And more important than that , we 're a team .
 So , if we 're gonna go down , we 're gonna go down together .
 Sorry , you kind of turned into there .
 - I love that film . - Pull yourself together , Steve .
 And all of you , play to your strengths .
 - What are we ? - [ all ] The Quiz Heads .
 The Quiz Heads .

 [ doctor ] Turns out you were right , you 're perimenopausal .
 You 're also pregnant .
 What ?
 Well , that 's impossible . Well , you are .
 But he had a vasectomy .
 Stranger things have happened .
 You 're pregnant , Jean .
 [ sobs ]

 Well , that makes the whole heartbreak thing so much more complicated .
 Mm .

 A sound a cat makes .
 I 'm afraid I can 't accept that , Knowledge Knights , no .
 Mu , M- U , is ?
 Population parameter .
 In statistics , a parameter is any summary number , such as an average or a percentage , that describes an entire population .
 I would have accepted a population parameter .
 That is absolutely the full and correct answer .
 And with that incredible recovery , I can announce that our NSQC UK champions of the year , with a score of 89 to 88 are ...
 - the Quiz Heads ! - Yes !
 [ audience screaming , cheering ]
 Whoa !
 Congratulations .
 Thank you .
 Didn 't think you could make it .
 I can get another job interview , I wasn 't gonna miss this .
 - Mum , listen , I need to ... - No . No , come on .
 I 'll treat you to a strawberry milkshake on the way home . Come on .
 - Maybe we could hang out tonight ? - Yeah , that 'd be great .
 I don 't think I want to have sex yet .
 We don 't have to have sex ever again , I just miss talking to you .
 It 's gonna be so cringe .
 - Hey , Viv . Are you coming too ? - Where ?
 To watch Jackson Marchetti make an absolute tit of himself .
 That 's not funny .
 - [ sighs ]
 Come on . He 's an idiot jock . - He 's not an idiot .
 He 's trying something new that he might not be very good at , which is brave .
 Whereas you do one thing really well , and you never shut up about it .
 [ chuckles ] If you 're referring to my Rubik 's cube , I don 't just do it well ,
 - I 'm actually the 28th best ... - We know , Dex , we know .
 We do kind of know , man .
 - Half an hour until curtain , guys . - Five , six , seven , eight .
 Elbow , elbow , up , down , twist , twist , up , down , and pop it , and pop it .
 Not at me , I 'm faculty .
 You got a problem , Quentin ?
 I 'm surprised you came , Ms. Milburn .
 I still have a child at the school , Mr. Groff .
 I 'm here as a parent .
 I 'm so proud of you , Froggy .
 - Don 't say that . - No , I 'm serious .
 I know I 've messed up so much , and missed so many things , but I 'm never losing you again .
 What 's going on ?
 We 're with Social Services .
 There 's been a report of drug use in the presence of a minor .
 Who reported it ? Did you do this ?
 I didn 't know they were coming .
 Someone 's reported something , haven 't they ? And it 's bullshit .
 It 's not bullshit , Mum .
 You did this ?
 I know you 've been using again , so don 't lie .
 She 's not safe .
 I slipped ... once .
 It was a mistake .
 I 'm in a program , they can help me .
 - You can 't take my kid .
 - We 're not taking her anywhere , we need to look inside the caravan if that 's all right .
 - Stay away from my caravan ! - I 'm sure we can sort this out ,
 - but we need to have a look inside . - Mum !
 We 'll have to call the police if you make a scene .
 - Let them look inside ... - Stay the fuck away from me !
 Don 't touch me !
 How could you ?
 How could you do this to me ?
 Here . [ laughs ]
 Here .
 You take her things .
 You say you 're not going to take her ... but you 're lying .
 You 're fucking lying .
 There 's a hostile resident not cooperating .
 We need assistance .
 - I don 't know if I need a bow tie . - You look very nice .
 Nice suit .
 Yeah , she 's all dressed up for her new girlfriend .
 Shut up , Dad .
 Well , what 's the problem ? I thought you were broken up with him .
 Yeah , I 'm kind of dating Lily now .
 I didn 't want to make it awkward .
 It 's not awkward .
 That 's ... That 's great .
 Young people are strange , so , come on .
 Actually , could I have a ...
 I wanted to apologize properly for making things difficult between you and my mum .
 I found not being her number one priority harder than I expected .
 It was very immature of me .
 Sorry for being an arsehole .
 Yeah ... you are a bit of an arsehole .
 But you 're also a good man , Otis .
 Do you think so ?
 I know so .
 Shall we ?

 - Hey . You okay ? - Yeah .

 The most important thing is you 're doing something you enjoy .
 Maybe you 're not nervous at all . Maybe you 're just super- duper pumped .
 Okay ?
 Doosh , doosh .

 Mum ...
 Mum , please talk to me . Come on .
 I will never forgive you .
 Never .
 Come on , darling .
 - You look nice , Mum . - Something new I 'm trying .
 Is everything all right at school ?
 How was your father ?
 Not good .
 Maybe we could ...
 let him come back ?
 Oh , darling .
 Your father needed to fight for us a very long time ago .
 What do you mean ?
 [ sighs ]
 When you love a person , there 's always a tiny part of you that 's terrified that one day you 're gonna lose them .
 And I think that your father 's so scared of that emotion that ... he stops himself feeling anything at all .
 But you have to let the people you love know that you love them , even if it causes you a great deal of pain .
 Why ?
 It sounds awful .
 Because you 're alive .
 I have to go .
 [ boy ]
 See ... where he comes .
 So please you , step aside .
 I 'll know his grievance or be much denied .
 Come , madam . Let 's away .
 - Shit . - [ boy ] Good morrow , cousin !
 Fuck .
 Good morrow , cousin !
 Colin , does anyone have eyes on Jackson ?
 - Jackson , that 's your cue . - [ Quentin ] I 'll go back on .
 I know all the lines .
 Shut the fuck up , Quentin , you piece of shit . Jesus Christ .
 - [ boy ] Good morrow , cousin ! - Get on stage , now !
 And remember , you 're not nervous , you 're just excited .
 Go ! Sir !
 [ audience murmuring ]
 - What 's wrong with him ? - I don 't know .
 Get on with it !
 [ laughter ]

 Good morrow , cousin !
 [ whispering ] Is the day so young ?

 Is the day so young ?
 Is the day so young ?
 Is the day so young ?

 - Remember the heartbeats . - What sadness lengthens Romeo 's hours ?
 Uh , I am out of her favor , where I am in love .
 Alas , she is too fair , too wise . Does thou not laugh ?
 - Good Romeo , forget to think of her ! - Oh , teach me how
 - I should forget to think . Her beauty is ... - Peace !

 Stop the show ! Stop ! The show is over .
 Why are the Groffs ruining my show ? Colin . Colin .
 - [ woman ] But we are enjoying it ! - [ woman 2 ]
 Yeah .
 You 're enjoying this filth !
 Well , it 's supposed to be funny , sir .
 You ... have all been corrupted ... - by this woman !
 - [ audience gasps ]
 She 's giving sex advice to your children , filling their heads with dangerous nonsense .
 No , that 's not entirely true .
 She was explicitly told she was not here as a counselor .
 I had no idea she 'd be so unprofessional .
 - Mr. Groff . - Okay . She wasn 't giving out sex advice .
 I was .
 And I shouldn 't have been ' cause I 'm 16 years old , and ... well , I 've only had sex once .
 Wasn 't even very good , apparently , but ...
 But my mum was here to listen to your problems and give you the advice that the school should have been giving anyway .
 What ?
 My mum is an excellent therapist , and she cares about people .
 She only wants what 's best for them .
 Which is why she 's also such an amazing parent .
 [ Mr. Groff laughs ]
 Well , that 's ridiculous .
 She reassured me that my labia is a normal length .
 And she really helped me accept myself . It 's changed my life .
 I fucked some warm fruit and she said I wasn 't weird .
 They 're children , for God 's sake !
 They don 't know what they want .
 - This is all your fault .
 - Mr. Groff .
 I need to see you outside .
 Immediately .
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 It 's completely ruined .
 It was meant to be perfect .
 Well , I think it was perfect .
 Have you completely lost your mind ?
 - That woman is ... - That woman nothing , Michael .
 [ sighs ]
 I know your wife has left you , and you 've been sleeping at the school .
 You 're clearly not coping very well , and you need to take some time off .
 I 'm fine .
 It 's not a request . You will take leave as of today .

 [ Otis ]
 Are you around to talk about it later ?
 Yeah .
 If you want to get back together with Jakob , I 'm cool with it .
 No more annoying only- child behavior .
 I promise .
 - Hey , Dex , have you seen Maeve ?
 - No , she didn 't come .

 Adam . This is my mum and my sisters .
 Lovely to meet you , Adam .
 - Hey . - Lovely to meet you .
 Uh ...
 - I 'll be right back . - All right .
 [ laughing ]
 That was so brave . Thank you .
 You have to pop around for dinner sometime .
 - Oh , yeah . - I 'll cook you some jollof rice .

 Rahim . - Rahim , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know he ...
 - Don 't apologize . It makes it worse .
 Be careful .
 He can hold your hand , but I 'm not sure he can catch you .

 [ Jackson ] I think you might be one of the most intelligent people I 've ever met .

 I definitely am .
 I was thinking it would be good to start making some friends .
 Maybe waiting until university was a bit extreme .
 Well , you still have a friend .
 That 's if you 'll still have me .
 Oh , I miss hanging out with you , man .
 A lot .
 Please can we be friends again ?
 Okay .
 Let 's be mates .
 Move that .
 [ laughs ]
 I missed you .
 [ Jackson ]
 Hmm .
 I missed you too .
 - [ Bev ] What happened with your parents ? - I 'm back in therapy .
 But it 's where I need to be , so ... [ gasps ]
 [ chuckles ]


 I think I might be ready for a hug .
 ♪

 - [ crying ]
 Enter .
 You did the right thing .
 I still feel like a piece of shit .
 Do you want to come in ? I 'll make you an omelet .
 Or you 'll make it and I 'll watch .
 [ chuckles ]
 Yeah .
 [ Maeve sighs ]
 You don 't even have milk .
 Do I look like someone who regularly pops to the shops ?
 Okay , I 'll go get some stuff .
 [ Maeve sniffs ]
 [ Isaac ] Oh , and get crisps .
 Oi !
 Maeve 's not there .
 Oh .
 Do you know when she 'll be back ?
 Can 't be sure .
 [ sighs ]
 Could you let her know that I was here ?
 And ... tell her to check her messages .
 Will do .
 Okay . Thanks .

 [ Otis ]







 It 's always been you .
 I love you , Maeve .
