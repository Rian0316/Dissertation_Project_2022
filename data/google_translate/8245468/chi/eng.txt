 You remember Mrs. Hernandez from the dry cleaners ' ?
 Of course . How you doing , Mrs. Hernandez ?
 I 'm fine , thank you .
 Mrs. Hernandez , this is Santiago , the boy I was telling you about .
 Mrs. Hernandez , we were wondering , though , if you could ask some questions of Santiago for us .
 His favorite snacks .
 - His favorite movies . - Favorite toys .
 Okay . Speaking Spanish .
 Hola .
 Ask him if he knows how to throw a changeup .
 He crossed the border with his father and sister .
 They were looking for asylum , but they got separated .
 And now he doesn 't know where they are .
 Hmm .
 Wait , he has family here ?
 They come here 'cause they 're afraid to be killed .
 [ Kev ] Well , he 's ours now .
 We signed the paperwork .
 And I love him .
 We can 't keep this kid .
 Yes , we can . He has an amazing arm .
 He has a family .
 [ sighs ]
 Mmm . Damn .
 These are tasty .
 All we ever had at my house was trail mix and oranges .
 Can I have another beer ?
 Yeah , sure .
 Damn . Why are these warm ?
 One ? It 's supposed to be at five .
 What the fuck ?
 You know , I got the GPS out of this thing , but it still won 't work .
 Hmm . Wait , hold on a second .
 - What 's up ?
 - Their website says that if you recharge the scooters ,
 - they 'll pay you . - How much ?
 Uh , between five and 20 a scooter ?
 - Per scooter ? - What ?
 - Holy shit . - All you gotta do is sign up .
 And find a bunch of them bitches , though .
 I can help you .
 How you two doing ?
 Fine .
 Yeah ?
 How 'bout you ? How you doing ?
 Great .
 Uh- huh .
 Okay .
 Hey , could I talk to you upstairs ?
 I 'll be right back .
 All right , what do you want , Frank ?
 Kelly seems nice .
 A little sad .
 Yeah , well , she 's not sad .
 No , no , no , no , no , no .
 I recognize that vacant stare .
 I 've known a lot of women , Carl .
 And that woman is not getting what she wants in bed .
 Shut up , Frank .
 You know what it is . She wants sex .
 Ten times a day .
 Not fucking snack time .
 Act like a Gallagher , for the love of God .
 Okay , I can have sex anytime , anywhere .
 Oh , bullshit .
 I got 20 bucks that says you can 't go in that bathroom ...
 That 's a hundred .
 Holy crap .
 Well , 20 of it says you can 't go in that bathroom right now and rub one out in under three minutes .
 I 'm trying to help you .
 If that woman downstairs yells , " Jump , " you better answer , " How hard ? "
 Make it a hundred .
 No . The bet 's 20 .
 No , wait . Fine . Fine .
 Fine . Okay . Fine .
 It 's all right . Jesus Christ .
 A hundred .
 What the fuck is that ?
 I gotta have proof .
 You want me to come in there with you and watch ?

 Remember the time we walked in on Aunt Ginger and saw her tits ?
 [ Carl ] Hey , Frank . Shut the fuck up .
 Were they something ?
 Been watching this thing on the , uh , nature channel about hippopotamuses , their balls ...
 - All right , all right . - That 's just cheating .

 Huh .
 So what do you think ?
 I mean , this could work , right ?
 You know , when you said basement ,
 I was like , " The only people who live in basements " are serial killers or 14- year- olds . "
 This is way worse .
 Smells like something died down here .
 Oh , yeah . Lots of things died down here .
 Were they babies ?
 No . Dogs .
 Ah .

 Was this also a homeless encampment ?
 Kinda .
 Okay , was Silence of the Lambs filmed down here ?

 Come on , I 'll show you .
 Come on .
 Finally .
 The chance to have what everyone else has .
 Children .
 You 've given me that , Frank .
 I don 't know that I can ever thank you enough .
 Should we say a little prayer ?
 That 's a great idea .
 I 'll do it , since I was Catholic .
 - [ clears throat ]
 - Mm .
 Heavenly Father , sweet Mary , that donkey , little drummer boy , as my swimmers swim through the valley of the shadow of death , may they fear no evil .


 May my rod and my staff have power and glory forever and ever , amen .

 Thank you .
 You guys have got to start living like grown- ups , and that starts in the bathroom .
 [ Tami ]
 All right .
 Okay . All right .
 Okay , okay , okay .
 So you 've got , uh , a bottle of dishwashing liquid in the shower and a bar of soap with five different colors of pubes on it .

 Wait , you guys can 't all share one bar of soap .
 No , no , I don 't .
 That 's why I have the dishwashing liquid .
 Is that why you always smell like lemons ?
 Yeah , I like lemons .

 Once you 're in your 20s , you should have at least two bath towels that match .

 Hi .
 Um , I asked for no dressing .

 Yeah , this dressing contains mayonnaise , and I 'm allergic to eggs .
 I 'm allergic to people with allergies .
 You don 't hear me whining .

 Excuse me ?
 I 'd like to speak to the manager .
 Okay .

 You wanted to speak to the manager ?
 What seems to be the problem ?
 - You 're the manager ? - Mm- hmm .
 - Well , you 're rude . - Okay .

 And I 'm never coming back .
 Okay , 'cause what I could really use are some more customers who are allergic to food .
 Bye .
 [ Tami ] This is alive .
 [ Lip ] Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . Let me see .
 - What are you doing ? - Sterilizing it .
 Just a minute . Kills the bacteria .
 No , you guys . That 's a myth .
 It actually creates super bacteria , which is even more dangerous .
 Oh , you see , we 're a bit more worried about super- tweaky meth freaks , so ...
 Okay , well , sponges are , like , five for a dollar , so you shouldn 't have a maintenance plan for your sponge .
 When it gets dirty , just throw it away .
 [ Debbie ] Gotcha .
 Do you guys reuse your Q- tips ?
 No , don 't answer that .
 Also , there 's one more thing .
 - What is this ? - It 's a box of clean underwear .
 Yeah , we share our underwear .
 I don 't have time to fold . Do you , Debs ?
 - Nope . - Oh .
 Okay .
 All right , I 'm a little surprised I have to say this , but you guys should each have your own underwear .
 Why do you give a shit ?
 No one 's asking you to stay here .
 You can go .
 We had a mom once .
 She didn 't stick around .
 Okay , sorry .
 I was just making a suggestion .
 So was I.
 Hey , I thought I was the angry one .
 - What are you doing ? - Vampire power .
 Appliances use electricity just from being plugged in .
 So that 's why I 'm going to make sure shit stays unplugged from now on .
 - [ Tami ] That 's smart . - [ Lip ]
 Whoa , watch out .
 - Whoa , Jesus . - What 's up ?

 [ Debbie ] God , you guys , seriously .
 We do not need this fan plugged in .
 I could fly a fucking kite in here .
 What ... what the hell is going on ?
 So for every one of these we recharge , we make , like , 15 bucks .
 So we 're gonna go out every single day , collect 'em , and recharge 'em .
 Mm- hmm .
