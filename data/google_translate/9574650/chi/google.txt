Nineteen
I thought it was the worst day of my life
you are like a princess
but it 's worse
i was sentenced to social service
It 's better than going back to school
Life isn 't easy after something like this
like you 're a bad celebrity
you become someone else
even to myself
But you can 't go back to the way you used to be
My mom seems to suffer more than me
Please Tony don 't leave me!
I kicked Tony away
it 's not true
Mom got really annoyed after that.
She started talking to herself as a third person
I think Gwen needs some sleep
OK
We are no longer fit to live there
that house that town
So we left with our two little twins
It has been sold)
It means can 't graduate but mom says it 's ok
you can graduate later
or find a job
or marry a rich man
Feel sorry
We went to live with my aunt Leigh
She 's mom 's half-sister
she opened a cafe
she doesn 't trust deodorant
because she had breast cancer
I like her
She said we could stay with her as long as possible
We have been here for over a year
She probably didn 't expect us to live this long
It 's good to have other people talking to mom
good for me
Makes it easier for me to not have problems
To be honest I 'm fine
I don 't feel anything anymore
didn 't feel good
like a superpower
Lee gave me a job
Mainly it should be to give me something to do
That 's called irony
See if Marvin can make me a banana boat
you fucking . . .
What would you like to do?
Is this your real name?
you know it 's real name
Billy is Leigh 's adopted son
bullshit
he is a good boy
All right
work is boring
But I did meet Todd there
Hello
He teaches kids to canoe
He is also very assertive
Know Finland?
doesn 't actually exist
It 's a place made up by the Soviets during the Cold War.
right
Is this a date?
Calculate
very good
He 's kind of like a dog
kind of cute
He kisses well too
My aunt has a cottage by the lake
OK
It 's okay to have sex
no big deal
I told him everything
Oh shit
right
Do you like to eat Mexican sizzling chicken?
he understands
Do you want to get married?
Think fuck it! sure
yeah fuck it!
Mom is excited about wedding
she 's totally devoted
- Why do you want to do it again? - What honey?
Tomorrow 's wedding dress fits perfectly
It used to fit better
Now
perfect
married young
is one of the most deviant things one can do this year
Mom used the money from Tony 's divorce to give me a wedding
It 's also quite unconventional
I am very happy
It 's the first time in a long time that I 'm really happy
Received email with bullets in it should be a threat
But even my name is spelled wrong
It 's not easy to be scared by this guy
And apparently don 't even know where I live
Cafe)
Excuse me
Have you thought about suicide?
what? - I mean there is no service charge included?
don 't worry
- no need to look for it - thank you
Do you know whose car it is?
I do not know what happened?
don 't know nothing
I used to find anyone looking at me
But now I 'm not sure
I 'm probably suspicious
- I 'll go to the office - ok
(closed)
Why!
what the hell?
Who are you?
God!
(James)
It 's an appropriate ending
The doomed love story
perfect tragedy
Then I didn 't die
While waiting for court, the police are watching me 24/7
do you want to eat?
don 't eat
Do you mind if I eat?
do not mind
Where is Alyssa?
I 'm not allowed to meet Alyssa
completely invisible
But I keep thinking about her
hello james
The test results came out and I want to talk to you
Want your dad to come?
My dad 's reaction to me being shot is to eat or cry
These two things often happen at the same time
sorry james
don 't need him
Okay
OK
You also know this information about James . . .
The bullet caused a lot of damage
She talked about my hurt
talk about complications
Said it would take a long time
There is still a long way ahead
But in many ways
James you are very lucky
i don 't feel lucky
OK
I feel like I 've been punished
maybe i deserve it
James?
I haven 't met Alyssa 's mom before
At first she looked nice
are you OK?
i 'm fine
- Want some yogurt? - no thanks
- How is Alyssa? - you have to break up with her
what? - It 's your fault, right?
Of course you didn 't mean what happened.
But you ruined her life and ruined everything
I am sorry
What can you give her?
Just like this?
no offense
It 's hard not to be offended
Will you be able to walk in the future?
it should be OK
They say you 're going to jail, right?
I have no idea
Probably
If you love her you should let her go
like in that song
I don 't know what song she 's talking about
But I feel like she might be right
you can write her a letter
i don 't want to write
She wants to go on with her life, it 's not good to have you by her side
I am sorry
But it is so
I 've been avoiding the truth
The harder you write, the better
You know she 's stubborn
I have stamps
I feel like Alyssa got the letter
because she never contacted me again
The good thing is that after a few surgeries
I was able to start learning to walk again
(Circular Criminal Court)
In the end I didn 't go to jail
good!
The jury finds me self-defense to save others
acquitted me of murder
That video definitely helped
do not move!
But still got me suspended for several other misdemeanors.
My dad buys a new car and I want to give him some money
but he doesn 't
It 's funny how people lie out of good intentions
This car drives better
after i almost died
Dad signs up for online parenting class
He started talking about his feelings
I really think it 's valuable for us to come out together
right
I am proud of you
thanks
I think we should do more activities together
OK
Bowling seems like a bit of a sleight of hand
Because it 's only recently that I can walk again
Great, right?
Good!
all hit!
But then it wasn 't me who had to worry
I never went home again
I can 't even walk across the driveway
there is so much sadness
thanks
strange to say
This bullet gave me new purpose in life
I have another reason to see Alyssa
go see if she 's okay
see her again
Hello
coffee shop)
very strange
a person is very important to you long time no see
Once you see it, you can even breathe easier
i want to find her
But then I thought it would be okay to just look at her
guard her
because you have to be wary of others
I haven 't been like this before
All I have left is Alyssa
Oh shit
Who are you?
God!
Hello
fucking
