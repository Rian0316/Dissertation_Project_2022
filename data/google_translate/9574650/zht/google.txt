19 years old this year
I used to think my life was at a low ebb
you are like a princess
But it 's worse than the low tide
I 've been sentenced to social service for what I did
It 's a trivial matter compared to going back to school
It 's not easy to go back after these things
Like becoming a notorious star
become another person
Even myself feel that way
But you can 't change back to the way you used to be
My mom felt worse when she found out about it
Tony, please don 't leave me!
I kicked Tony away
certainly not
My mom got a little pissed after that
She started referring to herself in the third person
Seems like Gwen needs some sleep
OK
We can 't stand living there
Whether it 's that house or that town
So we decided to move
I 'll miss the final exam, but my mom says it 's okay
You can study later
find a job
or marry a rich man
Let 's go live with my aunt, Allie
mom 's stepsister
she runs a coffee shop
She doesn 't believe in deodorants because of breast cancer
I quite like her
She said we could stay at her house as long as we wanted
We have lived here for over a year
She probably didn 't expect it to take so long
Mum has a partner to talk to.
At least don 't bother me
make it easier for me to let go
In fact, I am also very good
I don 't feel anything anymore
It 's good not to feel
like a superpower
Ali gave me a job
I think I have something to do
You may find this ironic
See if Marvin can get me a plate of banana splits, you motherfucker . . .
what do you want to eat?
Is that your real name?
you know yes
Billy is Ali 's adopted son
hard to hear
he is a good boy
Oh
work is boring
But I met Todd there.
Hello
He specializes in teaching children canoeing
And quite opinionated
Have you ever heard of Finland?
In fact, that place doesn 't exist, it 's just the old Russians
fabricated place during the cold war
yes
Is this a date?
Forget it
cool
He 's kind of like a puppy
It 's a compliment
He 's also a good kisser
My aunt has a cottage by the lake
Cool
Turns out the sex was pretty good
It is nothing special
I told him everything
wow
right
Do you like Mexican grilled chicken?
he understands me
Would you like to get married?
Okay, what 's wrong with it?
That 's right, take care of it
My mom is so excited about the wedding
she 's very involved in it
- Why should we try again? What 's up? baby
Tomorrow is the wedding, just make sure the dress fits
It fit well before
Now
perfect
Getting married at a young age is a modern day
most rebellious behavior
Mom uses alimony from Tony to pay for the wedding
Also quite abnormal
and i am happy
After so many years, I can finally feel happy
Getting a bullet in the mail should feel threatened
But when the other party can 't even spell your name
I don 't feel threatened
Besides, they don 't even know where you live
Excuse me
Have you ever thought about suicide?
what? - I asked: 'Are you going to pay for the service?'
no, no
- no more change - thanks
Do you know who owns that car?
I do not know what happened?
nothing, just ask
I used to be very good at seeing other people 's prying eyes
But I 'm not so sure now
Maybe I 'm thinking
- I 'll be at the office - ok
(closed)
what the hell?
Who are you?
gosh
That 's a perfect ending
a doomed love
perfect tragedy
And I 'm not dead
I was under police surveillance 24 hours before I was scheduled to appear in court.
do you want to eat?
do not want
Can I eat that?
Casual
What about Alyssa?
Alyssa and I were forbidden to see each other
Not even seeing each other
But I often think of her
hello james
I got a medical report to tell you
Do you need to call your dad?
My dad 's reaction to me being shot was to cry and eat
crying while eating
sorry james
no, it 's okay
Okay
Um
James, as you know, on the information side . . .
The bullet did a lot of damage to me
She talks about my hurt
Complications
takes time to recover
and the long road ahead
But no matter what
James, you are very lucky too
i 'm not lucky
All right
feel like i 'm being punished
maybe i deserve it
James?
I never met Alyssa 's mom
She was fine at first
Are you OK?
not bad
- Do you want to eat yogurt? No thanks
- How is Alyssa? - you 're breaking up with her
what? - It 's all your fault, right?
I know you didn 't mean to, but...
You ruined her life, you screwed everything up
I am sorry
What can you give her?
Look at you like this . . .
no offense
It 's actually hard to think she 's not offending me
Will you still be able to walk in the future?
it should be OK
They say you 're going to jail later, right?
I have no idea
Probably
If you love her, let it go
like that song
I don 't know what song she 's talking about
But it feels like she 's right
can you write her a letter
i don 't want to write
But she needs to forget about you, and you 'll only ruin her
sorry
But it 's true
The truth is something I 've always wanted to ignore
The more unsympathetic the better
You know how stubborn she is
I have stamps
Alyssa should have received that letter
Because I haven 't heard from her anymore
On the bright side, after multiple surgeries
I can walk slowly again
(Royal Court)
And I don 't have to go to jail in the end
Won!
The jury agrees that I only act to protect others
acquitted of murder
Those videos definitely helped a lot
do not move!
But I 'm on probation for other misdemeanors
I want to help my dad buy a new car
But he won 't let me do it
It 's funny how people tell white lies
This car drives fine
After I get out of hell
Dad signed up for the Online Good Parenting Course
He starts to express his feelings
I take our time together very seriously
Um
I am proud of you
thank you
We should spend more time together
Okay
Bowling is actually a bit of a challenge
After all, my legs have only recently recovered.
Super fun, right?
cool!
All down!
But in the end, it 's not me that I should be worried about
I never came home again
I don 't even want to walk to the driveway
There 's so much sadness there
thanks
Accidentally
This bullet brought new meaning to my life
An excuse to meet Alyssa
see how she 's doing
goodbye her
Hello
really weird
The person who holds a place in your heart but has not seen it for a long time
When you see her, you feel relieved
I want to go and chat with her
But I found that watching her beside me was enough
secretly protect her
Because life has to be vigilant
And I 've never been
There 's only Alyssa left in my life
Oops
Oops
Really bad
Who are you?
gosh
Hi
don 't you fucking
