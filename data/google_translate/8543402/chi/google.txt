I don 't see the point
Expensive and time consuming, useless at all
If you don 't get stiff in yoga class, who 's going to keep taking it?
Oh my god
please, that 's an awkward laugh
How about this
So far, I 've had enough
Okay, that 's it, I 've had enough

- why don 't we . . .
- do not want


half year ago

From this moment on, the couple has only one goal
hatch their eggs
This clumsy ballet step has to be practiced countless times
The couple 's partnership ends here
All the hard work was in vain
Now there is no reason to stay, they slowly walk back to the sea
Other couples also lost their eggs

As for . . .
I went out and called the kid

Exhausted mother penguin is leaving
It has to eat as soon as possible or it will die
Hey, are you all right?
you missed the last 20 minutes
In the end, the snow was dyed black by penguin poop

I just feel a little...
I really don 't want to . . .
no, the ending is good
- that 's fine - yeah
Even if the ending is bad, I will only feel that 'the scene must stink'
Are you going?
Okay
- Are you all right? - fine
Are we like that?
Who are we?
Like a penguin couple?
To keep our children together?
What? No, we . . .
you didn 't see the end
I 've always had the feeling that we 'll be done when they leave and the kids leave the house
That 's too ugly
No, that 's not bad at all
totally very reasonable
In case we no longer have enough in common to fill so many days and nights, so many nights
We 're gonna spend it together, just the two of us
No kids around?
Well, we 're going on a cruise or something.
Taking a cruise for 40 years?

Why not?
OK, so what are we going to talk about?
What?
go all out
He 's an actor, so he 's all narcissistic and childish
When he works, everything is run for him
Someone to take care of him, someone to brush his hair, someone to help him prepare breakfast, lunch and snacks, someone to help him prepare dinner
When it 's cold, someone wraps him in a coat and delivers hot food and she tells me so...

First of all I 'm definitely grateful for all this and then they do it because I 'm on set
Can 't get home for lunch
They comb my hair because that 's their job
Omg, I have to justify this
What are you upset about now?
Because, what else do you want from me? Comb your character 's hair yourself?
'Hi, sorry, can I brush my own hair? Although that 's your job' but I don 't want to make my wife angry'
i 'm not angry
I 'm just stating that you 've been privileged your whole life
You are used to being asked about your needs and then getting your needs met You are therefore emotionally and mentally immature
How to say? What do you want from me?
nothing
What about when Dennis isn 't working?
i will take care of the children
Yes, he will take care of the children
He takes good care of the child
Maybe you should... .
But he needs attention when he 's not at work, totally unconfident and super boring
that 's not the case
Well, even a little bit
I don 't think it affects my relationship with my family
I didn 't say it would affect
And when I 'm on vacation, she 'll throw a bunch of housework on me to make sure I 'm doing my part.
I take all the bills
I know very well that when I work, people seem to disappear
I 'm not there often, I know but I feel like she 's silently writing it down in her heart
every minute of my absence
Then check carefully and actuarially measure every household matter, and get a fair one.
never been fair
Do you make time for each other?
which aspect?
Like, do you have date nights?
- yes- yes


- what will you do? - come here
Is this your date night?
- Yeah, we 'll go to the movies later- yeah
Sometimes, if you 're not too tired
Maybe try something other than counseling?
Fun, easy everyday things
common hobbies etc.

Can you suggest something?
For example, some couples I tutor like to take drawing lessons
Yeah, I don 't really want to... .
You mean nude sketching? I really . . .
Not necessarily nude sketches
I can draw fruits, bottles and jars, etc. I think
Some couples go to dance lessons
- learn how to . . . - my god
- It 's too cheesy.- Seems like a lot of fun

Do you have any hobbies?
- I play tennis - food, cooking

- how? - Cooking is not your hobby
He doesn 't need a hobby his job is his hobby
Since Dennis says cooking is his hobby . . .
not
Cooking is my hobby, Sarah
Well, then my hobby is going to the toilet
nice
Make time for each other to do one thing together, anything is fine
All right
okay


ok don 't do that
Don 't how? Don 't score?
No, we haven 't even started the game yet
Don 't miss the ball, so I can 't hit it back
I just play ball, how do I know if you can play or not?
gosh, ok
Come to the game, you serve first
OK, so be it
If the ball hits twice, deduct 1 point. If the ball hits before hitting the ground, add 1 point. The first to score 20 points wins.
What? No, we play regular games
I don 't know how the rules are fair to me to play a regular game?
Come on, it must be fun, Dennis tennis
I don 't want to play Dennis, I want to play regular tennis
then i lose
who cares? Play to play, not to win or lose
Yeah

All right
Okay, do you want to try to serve well?
It 's better for us to play well
I don 't think sticking to the rules is fun
No, it 's fun to play by following the rules
Yeah, it 's not like your opponent keeps telling you how to play
- Gosh, alright - I doubt Billie Jenkin
Who would you call Chris Evans to release water during the game?


Like it, come on! bring it on
what happened again? where are you going?
Sarah? where are you going?
go home
Her name is Chris Evert, Chris Evert
No Chris Evans, idiot
Someone must be calling that name
Sarah!
Why can 't I go to dance class?
Is it that scary to learn to dance with me?

listen to me
What are you talking about now? you are saying . . .
Wait a minute, are you going to smoke this?
There will be fake cigarettes
yeah . . . i know that stuff
OK, continue
Okay
Complain about the deal you fucked
- Some bitch doesn 't want to . . .
- cheap
bitch, fucks

someone who doesn 't want to buy from you
some woman you want to have sex with . . .
Okay, hold on, great, really great

But you 're playing a man much older than you, right?
So keep your voice down
See what I mean? be calm

How is it? what does that mean?
But it 's a drama club performance
that 's not the point
you are awesome
Forget it, sorry, go on, again
listen to me
What are you talking about now? you are saying . . .
The bitch you killed?
Some bastard who wants to buy land?
He 's awesome. Someone who doesn 't want to buy from you?
Some woman you want to marry?
Drop me the coffee!
Only experts are qualified to drink coffee
Do you think I 'm joking with you?
i 'm not joking with you

I found this great place I have a little feral cat in my room that 's it
That 's it
ok, the vanilla is ready
I 'm going to take it out
Hope it doesn 't have stems in it, it doesn 't look bad
Hey
ok, next... .
What will the preview be like?

Very good, not bad response

What program?
I don 't know, I fell asleep
what time is it?
- I don 't know, 1:00, 1:30 - Omg
How was the party?
it 's fun, yeah


some people?

You don 't know, just the usual bastards
But it 's fun
I want to drink water, do you want it?





Out of bounds!
- No difference, you hit. - Of course there is a difference
That 's just intuition or reflex or something
you are out of bounds
no, not counting
Good catch, two points

Damn, it hurts
is out of bounds
Want to go to the movies? Will it be too tired?
I didn 't sleep well last night, I 'm a little tired, sorry
It does not matter

Just so embarrassing
what why?
Why? You didn 't introduce me to hang me across the street . . .
What are you doing? Did I embarrass you?
What? No la!
I don 't remember the guy 's name so I can 't introduce you
I know that guy 's name, he 's Ted Allen
Not him, another I don 't remember another guy 's name
So what? a little shoulder
Don 't make me stand there like a fool just because you don 't want to ask someone to remind you of his name
I want to meet Ted Allen
you just met him

Your ball, Nancy, is beautiful!

15 to 40! oh yeah
Okay, the one who hits the ball to the lighthouse gets three points
No, we 'll fight... .
three points
dad!
Oops, Nancy, go pick up the ball
pick it up yourself
Jack, go pick it up

i don 't want to play at all
You haven 't done anything at all this time
- go pick up the ball - you didn 't move
close your beak
hey, i don 't like it, it 's not good


Are you OK?
Do I look like I 'm alright? she hit my dick
Nancy, that 's not right, you know?

Why are you hitting his dick?
I didn 't mean to smash his dick, I meant to smash his testicles
ok, nice
Can we keep playing, please? screwed up are you happy?
That 's awesome, Dennis
It 's full of fun
- Does anyone feel bored? I 'm so bored - really, super fun
Only you want to play regular tennis
- thanks a lot, shut up - before you hit someone 's dick . . .
Okay, please don 't keep saying the word 'chicken' in public, okay?

You can 't make your deal you can 't make any shit

you are a fart
So man, get out of here, you 're lost
Trading resources are weak
Weak trading resources?
Damn, you said that trading resources are weak?
It 's you who is weak, I 've been doing this for 15 years
- What is your name? - Fuck you, that 's my name
Wonder why, sir?
'Cause you 're here tonight in a Hyundai
I drive an $80,000 BMW
that 's my name
Your name is not good enough, you can 't play this grown-up game
If you can 't figure it out, go home and cry to your wife
Only one thing counts in this world
Have the other party sign on the dotted line
Do you hear me, fucking scum?


she can 't


I forgot that line, but...
no one found
Yeah, but I 'm stuck, have you found anything? stayed too long
- No, no one found - I found
You fell asleep, close your beak for me
You shouldn 't look at the sleeping audience
should look at your rival actor
- she 's right - you shouldn 't be there
- That 's right - not suitable for children
I 'm so bored
- put me to sleep - all right
- Shut up - You just shut up
No wonder she is so serious, you are so serious!
- sorry to bother you - that 's ok
I saw you act today, you act so well
- thank you - you are so kind, thank you

Can I take a picture?
Not so good, but thank you
No, not with him, with him
Excuse me, I 'm your big fan
I love 'Breakthrough'
- Will you continue acting? - thanks
No, the filming will continue
But my character story ended last season, so . . .
No, why?
You and Alison really are the most engaging screen companions for me
- I 'm super supportive of them - I feel the same way
This pair is really attractive and the audience loves it
Thomas ' character they have to figure out a way to get him back . . .
We understand that after this story develops, the audience wants a new plot


That 's right
what 's that feeling . . .
What are you doing?
- sorry, I. . .
- Our family is eating
- Sarah . . .
- I 'm sorry, don 't be sorry, it 's me

Why don 't you say 'Excuse me, I 'm having dinner with my family'?
just drop it
Having said that, you are indeed his fan base
Usually he 's embarrassed that his fans are all single old women over 50 but it 's been a long time since no one has a crush on him so he can only do it
very sorry
ok, that, let 's go
- Are we leaving? - Yeah, we 're leaving
let 's go, jack

very sorry
I am married
I am 47 years old

So far, I 've had enough
Okay, that 's it, I 've had enough



I can. . .

Of course
Now what?
I don 't know, go home
the problem is i 'm a little hungry
I want something to eat
then go eat
I really thought we were going to grow old together
I really thought but I hate myself with you right now
I find myself staring at you sometimes waiting for you to make mistakes
that is. . .
when you seem simpler
I 'm jealous of you, I . . .
I 'm jealous of your life and your achievements
It 's more interesting than mine
I know you have your troubles too but it feels like it 's the little things I have to worry about all the heavy things and you just stand by
You let me take that role because I 'm good at it
Maybe I don 't want to be good at those, you know?
Maybe I never wanted to take on that role
Maybe you haven 't cared enough about me to ask if I want to
I think you 're pushing me far
keep pushing me far away from your life and fun and . . .
You never invited me to your party or premiere or . . .
I always think I must not love, I always think
'They are super jerk and I must not love' I know very well . . . '
I feel like you 're cutting me and the fun in your life because you know that if you see me in it you 'll realize that 's where I 'm supposed to be
you have to feel guilty
You don 't let me in your life, Dennis, so when I say we don 't have anything in common, don 't dress surprised, it 's all your fault

I am sorry
If I could turn back time and make a change, I 'd love to, but I can 't
No, you 're right
You are right, I am sorry for you
I 'm really sorry
OK
thanks
i 'm a big idiot
childish
if i don 't pay attention
It could be super miserable in five years
i really don 't want to
How is the soup?
I have no taste at all
Don 't know, hot?

i want something to eat
What do you two want to eat tonight?
please give me a hamburger
Medium rare, fries for salad, right?
Yes, no, yes, medium rare but I want fries
fries
Where is the kid going tonight?
at home
I like your kids
Thank you, you are so kind
Seriously, I like them
I don 't like kids, but I like them

You don 't believe her?
I don 't believe it, other kids
