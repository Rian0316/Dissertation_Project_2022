 00 : 00 : 01, 716 -- > 00 : 00 : 02, 883 ( water running ) Leonard , are you in the shower ? I can 't hear you !
 I 'm in the shower !
 I asked if you were in the shower , but that 's moot now !
 What ? Moot !
 Rendered unimportant by recent events !
 I can 't hear you !
 I 'm in the shower !
 I have to skip the chitchat .
 Emergency .
 What kind of emergency ?
 Mathematical -- 32- ounce banana smoothie , 16- ounce bladder .
 You might not want to do that .
 I assure you I do .
 Sheldon , I 'm not alone in here .
 What ? !
 Hello , Sheldon .
 What are you doing in there ?
 She can 't be in here !
 We were in here first ; can 't be in here .
 According to the roommate agreement , paragraph nine , subsection B ,
 " The right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure . "
 And believe me , I am experiencing a majeure force .
 Come on , you can 't wait two minutes ?
 Oh , Leonard , let the man pee .

 Penny ?
 Penny ?
 Penny ?
 What ? Move .
 Move . Move !

 ( laughing )
 Dr. Leonard Hofstadter , you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement .
 Do you waive reading of the charges ?
 Yeah , fine .
 Hang on . No .
 My client does not waive reading of the charges .
 LEONARD : Oh .
 Cool .
 I 've got a lawyer .
 And I 've seen her naked .
 ( chuckles )
 Proceed .
 Very well .
 ( clears throat )
 " Count the first :
 " On or about the 28th day of April ,
 " the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought
 " deny access to the shared bathroom " in a time of emergency , to wit , my back teeth were floating .


 " Count the second : the accused exceeded " the agreed upon occupancy of the shower ,
 " to wit , one , unless we are under attack by water- soluble aliens . "

 Can I see the roommate agreement ? Um , it 's fairly technical .
 I think I can handle it .
 Top of her class , Cambridge University .
 Licensed to practice law in three countries and your face .

 All right , based on a cursory reading , it doesn 't look like you have much of a case , Sheldon .
 Do so , do so .
 Oh , I 'm afraid not .
 Section seven here , on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations , is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency .
 Oh , that 's ridiculous !
 A bathroom emergency is self- explanatory .
 Is it ?
 If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair , could he barge in while you were showering ?
 Irrelevant . Leonard doesn 't trim his nose hair .
 He thinks because he 's short nobody can see up there .

 My point is , Sheldon , the legal principle is , ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it , in this case , Leonard .
 So much for count one . But ...
 There 's no buts , Sheldon ; that 's how the law works .
 Schooled !

 As for the shower capacity issue ,
 I cite addendum J.
 " When Sheldon showers second , any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water . "
 I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue .
 Superceded !

 This isn 't over .
 No offense , but shower sex with you is now the best thing that 's happened today .

 Mmm , Greek food on pizza night ?
 This is the most delightfully cruel thing we 've done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail .
 ( laughs ) Seriously ?
 ( imitating mechanical voice ) :
 I wish to discuss your theories of black holes . ( laughter )
 Meet me at the Randy 's Donut by the airport at 2 : 00 a . m .
 What is that you 're eating ? Tonight is pizza night .
 I 'd like to refer that to my attorney .
 According to what I see here , Thursday nights are Franconi 's pizza night .
 Yes , and when Franconi 's went out of business , we switched to Graziano 's .
 That 's interesting .
 Can you just switch restaurants like that , Priya ?
 A good question , Howard . Turns out you can 't .
 According to the document you drew up , Sheldon , the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60- day comment period .
 Were those criteria met ?

 No . Opa !
 Opa ! Opa !


 This is Greek food ? Leonard , you hate Greek food .
 Not as much as you .

 Fine .
 I 'm nothing if not adaptable .
 I got you the lamb kabob . Thank you .

 If you think about it , Greek food isn 't that far from Italian food .
 They share a spice palette .

 And what a civilization is the Greeks ' !
 They gave us science , democracy , and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat .
 Penny ?
 Penny ?
 Penny ?
 Hey . What 's up ?
 The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb .
 Congratulations .
 Pizza night will now be at your apartment .
 Order one .
 Oh , I 'm sorry , honey ,
 I 'm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner .
 But you 're welcome to tag along .
 A girls ' night ?
 Oh , I don 't know if I 'm up for an evening talking about rainbows , unicorns and menstrual cramps .
 Okay , suit yourself .
 We 'll probably be trashing Priya a little .
 Shotgun .
 Okay , I 'd like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls ' night out .
 Fair warning -- we can get ca- razy . Yeah .
 Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons .
 Really , Amy ?
 Tobacco and alcohol ?
 Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time ?

 Why did you bring him ?
 He 's harshing my buzz .
 I felt sorry for him .
 Priya 's giving him a hard time .
 Ooh , the Priya bashing 's starting early .
 Yay !
 Okay , what 's up with those pantsuits ?
 I need some context . Pantsuits suck .
 And that opens her up to justifiable ridicule for wearing them .
 Good one , Bernadette .
 See ?
 Ca- razy .

 Whee ... !
 ( laughing )
 You smell like baby powder . It 's talc .
 But as that 's a primary ingredient of baby powder ,
 I understand your confusion .
 Oh , I 'm not confused at all .
 You 're like a sexy toddler .
 I don 't know how to process that . I do .
 ♪ Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree ♪ ♪ K- I- S- S- S- S- I- N- G. ♪
 That 's too many S 's for " kissing . " Not if they 're doing it for a long time .
 Sheldon ... have you ever kissed a girl ?
 Other than my mother , my sister and my Mee- Maw , no . But in the interest of full disclosure ,
 I was once on a bus and had to give mouth- to- mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion .
 Every year I get a Christmas card from her , signed with far too many X 's and O 's .
 That doesn 't count .
 Aren 't you even a little curious ?
 Yeah , you 're a scientist -- where is the curiosity ?
 I 'm available for experimentation .

 Thank you . Not necessary .
 We know everything there is to know about kissing .
 It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles .
 Oh , blah , blah , blah .
 Give me some sugar , bestie .
 ( laughs )
 I 'm certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice .
 Hey , I know -- let 's take Sheldon dancing . Ooh , I totally want to see Sheldon dance .
 I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate .
 No , thank you , but for the record ,
 I 'm an excellent dancer .
 Proficient in the rumba , waltz and cha- cha .
 Really ?
 I don 't see why that 's surprising .
 I excel at so many things .
 You 've had my sourdough bread .
 Did you take dance lessons ?
 Against my will .
 In the South , preadolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion , which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna .

 Oh , we are so taking you dancing .
 No , you most certainly are not .
 Well , what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree ?

 I saved a nun 's life . Why am I being punished ?

 ( Sheldon grunts , Penny squeals )
 Take us someplace we can waltz . Where you can what ? Waltz .
 It 's a social dance from Austria choreographed to a three- four time signature .
 ( hums " The Blue Danube " ) ( speaks Korean )
 ( dispatcher replies in Korean ) ( speaks Korean , hums " The Blue Danube " )
 Oh , waltz . ( dispatcher speaks Korean )
 Here we go .
 ♪ I kissed a girl and I liked it ♪ ♪ I hope my boyfriend don 't mind ... ♪
 What happened to you ?

 ( waltz playing )
 Shake it baby , shake it ! Sheldon !
 Care to dance ?
 Oh , I 'm sorry , I 'm engaged .
 How about you ?
 Oh , what the hell .
 ( chuckles ) Ooh !
 How come if we 're the smart people , we don 't do this every night ?
 What 's 16 times 14 ?
 My burps taste like cranberry juice .

 And there 's your answer . Would you like to come in for a nightcap ?
 If you 're referring to the beverage , you know I don 't drink .
 If you 're referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle , I have one .
 I have Yoo- hoo .
 It 's hard to say no to Yoo- hoo .
 The name literally beckons .

 Make yourself comfortable .
 Thank you .
 Is someone smoking ?
 Oh , that 's just Ricky .

 You own a smoking monkey ? Don 't be silly .
 He 's one of the animals in my department 's nicotine addiction study .
 What 's he doing here ?
 I 'm giving him emphysema .
 The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable .
 Remarkable .
 Aren 't you worried about secondhand smoke ?
 A little .
 The real danger is him biting my face off while I 'm sleeping .

 ( coughs ) Is he deliberately blowing smoke at me ? Yeah .
 He 's kind of an ass .

 Thank you .
 May I share something with you that 's troubling me ?
 Of course .
 What 's rattling around that big bulbous head of yours ?
 Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard , making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me .
 And you want me to kill her ?
 Done . No , of course not .

 I trained Ricky how to smoke . I can train him to shoot a poison dart .
 No jury would convict us ' cause people love monkeys .
 I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild ... but I really need to talk to smart Amy now .

 ( chattering )
 Excuse me .
 Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma ?
 No .
 What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory ?
 Well , when challenged , monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing , assault and a stylized penile display .
 That 's a little outside my comfort zone . You 're being too literal .
 My point is , he would not meekly surrender to the rules , and neither should you .
 Are you suggesting I play dirty ?
 Yes , dirty .
 Dirty ... dirty ... dirty .
 Which brings me to our next order of business .
 Fascinating .
 I hope you don 't take what I 'm about to do as a comment on what we just did .

 ( Amy retching )
 ( retching continues )
 Who 's to say you shouldn 't be dissecting our brains ?
 You really are an ass . ( retching continues )
 Morning , Sheldon . Oh , good , you 're up .
 I 've written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly .
 I 'd like you to sign it .
 Why would I want to do that ?
 Excellent question .
 Do you remember what happened to the alien , played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin , in the episode " Let That Be Your Last Battlefield " ?
 Uh , Captain Kirk activated the self- destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the and kill them both unless he gave in ?
 Affirmative .
 Computer , this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper .
 ( computer beeps )
 Activate self- destruct sequence . Code 1- 1- A- 2- B.
 FEMALE COMPUTER VOlCE :
 Self- destruct sequence activated .
 What are you gonna do , Sheldon , blow up the apartment ?
 That was my first thought , but all my cool stuff is here .
 So what happens when it counts down ?
 Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds , this computer will send an e- mail to your parents in India saying that you 're in a secret relationship with the whiter- than- Marshmallow- Fluff

 Leonard Hofstadter .
 Oh , my God .
 What 's the big deal ?
 Trust me , it 's a big deal .
 They 're gonna find out about me eventually , right ?
 Yeah , of course , just not today .
 20 seconds .
 Are you ashamed of me ? Of course not .
 Then why can 't we tell your parents ?
 Please , don 't push this .
 He does that all the time , doesn 't he ?
 15 . Okay , fine , Sheldon , you win .
 Turn it off .
 No , he 's bluffing .
 I never bluff .
 Ten .
 It 's blackmail ! Nine .
 We give up .
 Eight .
 This is ridiculous .
 It 's a laptop with a full charge .
 Honestly , what do you see in him ?
 Give him what he wants or we 're done .
 Three . Really ? Two .
 Okay , I 'll sign it !
 FEMALE COMPUTER VOlCE :
 Self- destruct sequence aborted .
 You may have gone to Cambridge , but I 'm an honorary graduate of Starfleet Academy .

 ( Skype alert rings )
 Good morning , Amy .
 It most assuredly is not .
 Are you experiencing dehydration , headache , nausea and shame ?
 Yes .
 I also found a Korean man 's business card tucked into my cleavage .
 What happened last night ?
 Ah , memory impairment ; the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle .
 Sheldon ?
 All right .
 Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home , you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes , following which you passed out on your bathroom floor .

 I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow , set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy ... ... and I left .

 Okay .
 Don 't really know where we go from here .
 I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked .
 Terrific .
 Thank you .
 ( monkey chittering )
 They were out of menthols !
 Get off my back !

 Not easy living with a temperamental little primate . LEONARD : Come on , Priya , just admit I embarrass you !
 You 're preaching to the choir , sister .
