anyone will remember
It 's all in the computer, the computer remembers it
data will be converted into scores
It 's hard to say, it 's actually kind of stupid.
I just want to watch the game, you 're just afraid of losing twenty bucks
If you want me to gamble, then gamble
Why should we bother with these superfluous things?
Trust me you will eventually... . .




He 's not in a coma, but he 's not responding. The signs are stable. They 're controlling his blood pressure.
But whether he 'll wake up and understand what 's going on, we don 't know.
this doesn 't work
Gustavo, he 's being treated very well here
Even the best hospitals can hardly do better
Even if he was treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital
would be any different
probably will
or nothing at all
but in the end
finally
I can 't think of anything better for him
Doesn 't he deserve what he 's doing now?
What happens to him, I have the final say
No one 's turn to say

finally got up
Want freshly squeezed orange juice?
Great, Vit C

I don 't think so
Maybe it 's impossible to say

And the healing power of leftover bacon from my breakfast sandwich
Well I believed it and I made coffee
Add some cinnamon to taste
Try something different you 're up early

not not at all
I 'm the one who quarrelled with you, without me anyway
- sorry- just about to get up, I have a bunch of interviews
I want to seize the opportunity to go south first
There is an interview for the office director in Povardera
Then head north to Argodones
There are many places to run
Jimmy, you can slow down
Now no one 's going to complain that you don 't have a stable job


what are you waiting for
I don 't want to keep thinking about work
We need another paycheck too
Besides, this is your office now
I don 't want to distract you
- but you won 't distract me - that 's right
So I 'm going out looking for a job

Myself
dad
it 's over


keep it
no one will come






child
So when will you be done?
i figured out a way






















You see that 's Alma
On the left is Mr. Ollieve 's aunt and uncle
They started this company about fifty years ago - awesome - yeah
The other is Frank Kirk
one of the early maintenance workers
They must be relying on him that 's a thermal fax machine
Requires special coated paper
to print the finished product
You know well I used to work in the mailroom
Interact frequently with maintenance workers
They like to talk about their own business
Yeah, it 's a bunch of lonely people
This special bestseller
made us famous
- that 's a 6 5 0 0 color machine - yeah this is awesome, have you ever seen how awesome it is?
It only takes fifteen seconds to print a sheet I used to use it when I was in Chicago
This machine is too useful
So much so that counterfeiters use it to print counterfeit five-dollar bills
what
- Yeah - that 's not right
- Yeah - look here
You have a lot of decorations here, right?
Mr Neff is keen to sponsor children
bowling fun we did well in the nineties
But the kids don 't seem to be interested anymore
Yeah this generation recognizes sandbags and video games
who said no

Hummel Terracotta Figures
to those that are Alma 's
She likes to collect little toys Will God rest her in peace
I know a woman who 's also visiting the wall full of rubbish
I have to throw them all in the trash
But not yet motivated
Mr. Neff, this is James McGill. Just call me Jimmy. Nice to see you, Jimmy. Come over here.

please sit
Henry told you what kind of person we 're looking for
he told me
Salesmen running from office to office
Can accept countless closed doors
Just one mission to upgrade their old copiers to your latest model
Do you think you have this ability?
Easier said than done
I would love to try
I gotta say Jimmy knows copiers well
Yes
So


It says you were a lawyer before
until not long ago
What happened
Do you know why God created the viper before he created the lawyer? He needs practice
- 'needs practice' - yeah that 's the only lawyer joke I know
Because the rest is real
I know you 're looking for someone with sales experience I really don 't have one
In addition to my lawyer experience
A lawyer 's job is to sell
I have to sell to judges, to juries, and sometimes I have to sell to clients
Convince them to accept the best deal and give up the bad option
But every moment of every day I 'm persuading
are promoting
I understand what you mean
We have a lot of high priced products
Customers tend to refuse
My soul animal is a monster lizard
I won 't let go once I catch my prey
i like i like
You 're right Jimmy
I see why Henry wants me to see you
thank you for coming
No problem, you 're welcome
we need to discuss
Results in about a week
- Great - I 'll let you know when
- thank you - you 're welcome
Great









what 's the matter
I 'll finish soon
Of course Jimmy
what do you think listen i know
You need to take some time to consider these candidates
But can we decide now
We all know there is a saying called opportunity cost.
The time you look for the right person is the time I can work for you
Of course, there are a lot of people out there than me
Experienced salesmen but how many of them can come and apply in the next week?
Are they worth the wait again maybe it 's worth it maybe but I can say
None of them are better than me
No one is more familiar with your products
I used to work in the mailroom
I know the importance of copiers, deadlines, urgent changes, and I 'm all there
I 'm clearing paper jams I 'm clearing ink from the axles trying to figure out where the vertical lines on the paper are coming from
I bow down
The tie is misplaced, the hands are covered in ink, and the line of assistants are waiting outside the door, all worried about losing their jobs
If they can 't get the file within five minutes
I know I know copiers better than anyone
is the heart of any business
Copier failures cause delays
will cause losses
can lead to employee dissatisfaction
Will affect the office environment, business activities will be half-dead
But once you use your brand new machine
a healthy and strong heartbeat
bang bang bang bang
This is good business
bang bang bang bang
It 's a successful business
That 's what we 're selling



Wait a while






I do not need. . .
It 's pretty exciting and the passion this gentleman has . . .
You imagine the effect of sending him out
yes
Jimmy welcome to the team
Really
- That 's right - congratulations
We got Audrey from HR to help you onboard
fill out the documents
I hope you will be ready by today
Does that work? Yes, it gets you to work. What are you waiting for?
But you were going to spend some time
think again
As a result, I came in and made a generous statement.
got the job
yeah that 's it
are you crazy

you don 't know me at all
I just walked in from the street
You two are like two cats
I came in and waved a shiny thing
You screamed in excitement
no due diligence
no background checks
didn 't directly hire a nice talker
I might be a serial killer
I might pee in your coffee pot
Maybe I 'm both
So you don 't accept the job
no i do not accept
idiot
i pity you

Nao Restoration Machine










hello please
Are you still hiring sales assistants?
Great, I 'll be there in twenty minutes
Jimmy McGill
Allen is great
thank you allen see you soon







Grandpa see how high I swing
great, be careful






Hey

I am


what time do we meet

OK, I can get to you to inform her
Okay
ok baby, it 's time to take you back to mommy
Can you play another five minutes?
baby don 't do this
please
five minutes
I am timing
thanks









good afternoon
Hello, I am looking for Pastoral Electric
Go straight down the corridor to the conference room on the left
Thank you
very good please take a seat







You came all the way, not just for me
I travel a lot for meetings with dealers
Albuquerque is just one of the stops, okay?

I just want to hear your explanation
You stole an employee 's ID
Easy access to my warehouse disrupting operations and threatening my plant manager

why i 'm a security advisor on your ledger
My presence in your warehouse makes this cover-up more credible
If anyone asked me if I was there, I was
Besides, you have some problems that need to be corrected
Treat it as my extra service, that 's not the point, it 's supposed to be a paper deal
You sit at home and we pay you . . . your own money
you do things your way
would increase the risk of exposure
I think it reduces the risk
As I said now my face matches the name of the salary
what is your plan
Pastoral has eight sites in the Southwest
I 've been to one and there are seven left
if i want you to reconsider
Then I want you to reconsider



Gus Flynn has some respect for you now
If it were me, I would cherish this respect











Hello
Sorry to bother Dr. Desace, this is Dr. Maureen Blackner.
Just got to the hospital this morning
nice to meet you hello dr blakener dr blakener is a visiting scholar from johns shopkins
We invited her to be the inpatient department
Attending physician of several seriously ill patients
Including Mr. Salamanga - Johns Hopkins - yes
Can invite experienced Dr. Blakener
It is an honor to lead us
only temporarily
I won 't get in your way
ok when you want to call the patient file
The staff here will help you at any time
I 'm always happy to help if you have any questions
Thank you
Just to clarify, I don 't want to get in your way
We can look after this patient together if you want
no no he gave it to you
thanks
good luck

Well, the patient will be handed over to you
Please let us know if you need anything
thank you are you family members are you family members
is it the son
he is our uncle
hope you know
Your uncle has the best care at Lovelace Hospital
But we 're going to try new treatments
When listening to brain damage due to a stroke
Damaged areas are irreparable
Our job is to stimulate your uncle 's brain

Let the brain repair itself

We 're going to start with the legs
when did they come

Don 't worry, the situation is under our control
Hello, are you also family members?
OK
Like I said, I 'll bring an occupational therapist later
Initiate electrical stimulation of the patient
at this time
I want you to speak to Hector
possible
he can hear you
The more you talk, the more chance your brain will respond
There is also a greater chance of the nerves reconnecting
ok
very good
We will try to help your uncle
Very happy to meet all of you
say







Hector
The streets are fine and our people are busy

very busy
That 's right Hector
Now our scale is the largest
all is well
We had a bit of a run-in with the gang in Lomas.
But we 've taught them a lesson
get things done
No one wants to mess with Salamanga
no one dares





you look good mr hector
really good
those doctors will cure you
That 's right
You 'll definitely get through this
then get stronger













hello is it me can we meet
- Not now - I 'm in town
You can meet anywhere you want
The phone isn 't being monitored, right?
I talked to your security services contractor and I explained the situation again
But he still went his own way
I understand
But he 's just kidding
Does the reason for doing these things matter?
If the person is unreliable, the reason is of course important
He 's reliable so I should keep getting him
I stole my employee 's ID.
I don 't know where he will show up next time
What kind of confusion will it cause
And what kind of mess am I going to clean up?
I don 't want to bother with these things
Then I suggest you give him a certificate directly

Loboro Fried Chicken
varga and salamanga people cologne
they came in the afternoon
The nephews were in his ward all day
blackner watched him three times
She has a few experts around her
They took him for a brain scan
and then
That 's it, nothing else






do you want me back to the hospital
No
call victor
let him come to see us







Only the last files left
I know Chuck is very thoughtful
But I didn 't even think
there will be so many files to process
I worked with him for so long
I 'm surprised and happy to see him being so restrained
This one is - a previously discussed property transfer agreement - that 's right
Please sign here

and here
am i late
It 's almost over on Rebecca 's side.
Hi Rebecca, nice to see you again
I 'm sorry we didn 't get a chance to chat more at the funeral. It 's okay. No one was in the mood for small talk.
So Jimmy isn 't here
I 'm here to represent him and that 's about it
I 'm sorry to have called everyone over so soon, after all Chuck 's funeral didn 't take long. I 'm actually to blame.
Howard is polite.
thank you Julie
Anyway, since Rebecca happens to be in town
It 's best to talk about the inheritance in person.
Of course
Chuck left the house to Rebecca and as executor I will liquidate the property
Howard suggested, of course I agree.
we should
Show Jimmy a look at what 's been preserved
then take what he wants
If he has feelings for something we can make an appointment and provide trucks and warehouses
to keep what he chose to keep
No problem Jimmy doesn 't want you at all
The garage should be intact
Except for some broken pipes
he doesn 't want thanks
ok i understand
Then Jimmy 's words
All that 's left is to get him to sign the agreement and we can give it to him after the agreement is signed.
his inheritance
I guess four thousand bucks
five thousand
Are you trying to exclude him from your will?
I don 't want to provoke protests
Just enough money to indicate the recipient hasn 't been forgotten
Chuck also for a promising youth scholarship
donated a large sum of money
I hope Jimmy can agree to serve on the board I 'll let him know
is there anything else
Chuck left a personal letter to Jimmy

only him


Howard thank you for all you do
I know it 's difficult
It 's hard for all of us


I don 't want to delay you
let me take you out
Actually, Howard, we still have something to discuss
Kim please say hi to Jimmy I will see you Rebecca
Me too

be careful
gold
I 'm just
i must know
What are you thinking
About what you went to see Jimmy on the day of his brother 's funeral
And the bullshit he said
What the hell are you thinking that Chuck committed suicide
What 's wrong with you

I think

i owe jimmy a truth
owe him a truth do you owe Rebecca
will you tell her your theory
Chuck deliberately set fire to suicide
I guess it 's not that I think you 're just telling Jimmy that theory.
Kim, I didn 't do this to hurt Jimmy
No you do it to make yourself feel better
That 's not my intention
Let go of your sins and make yourself better than who cares what this means to Jimmy right?
As long as Howard Hamlin is okay Kim you 're not fair and fair
So let 's talk about fairness

Have Jimmy in the fire wreck where his brother screamed to death
rummaging around and finally let him pick up a souvenir or two
That 's really fair
I heard right
What do you want him to serve on the board of a scholarship a Chuck says
Nor will the scholarship for Jimmy Absolutely not
This is too much What is Howard
What the hell is written in here?
Everyone is dead and you have to leave a sentence 'Fuck your brother'
How could I do such a thing to him
Alright Kim
Is there any remedy
nothing
There 's nothing you can do, just stay away from us











I hope you 're hungry, I bought a lot of food
Of course, I 'm open to anyone. The bar is still the sofa.

Sofa bar, then go to the sofa to eat
Five minutes later if I remember correctly
There is a classic movie channel about to broadcast
'Blood Fighting Bandits' has no commercials in the middle
Another channel will be showing Jaws 3 but with commercials
It 's hard to decide
Jaws 3-D to be exact

Let 's watch 'Blood Fighting Bandits' Well, I bought Thai iced tea
You can have some wine if you want
How about finding a job without iced tea?
Not bad, found several job opportunities
In fact, one already wants me
- really - yes
But it doesn 't feel right
It doesn 't feel like a good fit for me but maybe there will be one or two other companies
call me back
What a great start
Who can invite you who is the honor
How are you today
Basically stay here to organize the information
Although Paige and Kevin didn 't pressure me
But I have to get back to work soon, right?
That 's right
The movie is about to start
What about the remote control?







'The Bavarian Boy' Hummel Terracotta Figure
