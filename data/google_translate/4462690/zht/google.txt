are we there
don 't lift your head up
how is he
I want to tell you too but I can 't be sure without checking
you know what i 'm gonna say
Why can 't you check the eyeball the traditional way with a stethoscope or something
he doesn 't want to be here
What he wants and what he needs are two completely different things Jimmy
We don 't know if his loss of consciousness was caused by a heart problem or a minor stroke
We don 't know if his spine is injured or if his brain is swollen
At least there is a good chance of a concussion
Chuck still refuses to do the test because it would subject him to 'electromagnetic bombardment', that 's what he said.
Exactly the same as the last time he was in the hospital
I have explained it very clearly
I won 't put him in the hospital
How to apply for a temporary emergency guardian
he is eligible
You told me he needed medical treatment so badly he couldn 't wait for the court to complete the review process.
That 's right

And Chuck can 't understand the consequences
He is understandable but he . . .
That 's right
Judges will understand
Then I can take him home
Waiting for test results and appropriate treatment can
I know a judge who can contact him now
let me tell him
how are you bro
Chuck
you 're on call
What 's the meaning
Is Ernesto outside?
do you need anything
Ernesto
please come in
Relax
Ernesto
put your stuff there
I called him
how do you feel mr mcgill
Ernesto how long have I been in a coma in that replica shop
I 'm not sure
thirty seconds one minute
- Still two minutes - maybe a minute
You are sometimes awake and sometimes confused
how long i lay on the ground before the ambulance came
I didn 't look at my watch for about ten minutes.
And then you 've arrived
Chuck can we . . .
There 's only one way to get you there so fast you didn 't even go
you are so excited
you have to take a deep breath . . .
you bribed him . . .
- the teller - what
You gave that idiot money while Ernesto was gone and I wasn 't there
- Let him say he never saw you - Mr. McGill
And then you 're just around the corner watching
- Why do you want to see me suffer? - Mr. McGill
Want to see me make a fool of yourself?
I called him
what
I called Jimmy before picking you up
He showed up because I called him
I 'm worried about you so...
I called him sorry
Get out, both of you out
Chuck, there 's something I have to do, I 'm really sorry
I 'm really sorry but I have to do it for you
you want me to be hospitalized
Not just temporary . . .
Temporary emergency guardians say different things
you finally locked me up
you look tired
go home and rest
i can hold on
Say what you need
it 's okay
Ernie
why did you say you called me
I do not know either
I didn 't want to talk too much but your brother . . . the way he was talking about you recently . . .
It 's like . . . he 's really going to get you Jimmy
I can 't tell
you are my friend
thanks
I will call you tomorrow
I really miss the mail room
Do you know the Hippocratic oath?
you should know
One of the oldest binding documents in history
Don 't hurt the patient first
It 's not right for you to treat me like this
It 's like I 'm allergic to penicillin and you guys insist on using it to treat my infection
Thanks for the Charles analogy but I don 't think the analogy is appropriate
We 'll do the radiology before you know it, okay?
Then we 'll take off the neck brace and let you move around
All right, Charles scan is about to begin.
The table you are lying on will move
You will hear a relatively loud noise but don 't worry
no news yet
gosh
How long will it take?
She said the whole examination was only ten minutes.
maybe they have to redo
redo twenty times
he should go home
Jimmy you are right
can you take the work out
Because I don 't know how long I 'll be waiting here
If you could do something else, I 'd feel better, do something that has nothing to do with the hospital
Nothing to do with the hospital
OK
I 'll ask the situation
good idea
You are the greatest generation
- Jimmy - you didn 't start WW2
but ended it
And if that 's not enough, you 've put a 90-meter-high rocket on the moon
Now you 're in your old age, you need someone to take care of, you need someone you can trust
A person who keeps his word when you need a reliable person
- I choose Jimmy - I choose Jimmy
I choose Jimmy
Because courage is rare now
Jimmy McGill Lawyers You Can Trust
great jimmy
you made a great commercial
Thanks
Good rice
Finally figured out what happened to him
The good news is that there is no physical problem
The radiologist said Charles had a normal head and spine, so we had his collar removed.
The wound on his head will heal quickly
Gave him tetanus because his vaccination record is not up to date
you 're not surprised
What about his heart
very strong
normal electrocardiogram
The most likely cause of loss of consciousness is
Charles ' syncope linked to stress
Usually panic attacks but no strokes and heart problems
But there are still . . . complications
Brother Chuck is me
The doctor said everything is fine, let 's get out of the hospital
what do you say
What 's up with him
The drug effect should have passed, right?
We 've been watching him for hours
even used a reversal agent
Yes, the sedatives are over.
- for other reasons - for what reason

We think it 's auto-induced catatonia
'we' is always 'we think'
I think it 's what you think
You are the only doctor in the house
I think you burned his brain with the machine
Good rice
- Sorry for the nonsense - Jimmy
what 's next
Charles was in a similar state the first time I treated him
Do you agree
I believe it 's only a matter of time before he wakes up
time issue
ok then i 'll wait here
1.5 minutes to the left
How many rounds can this gun shoot?
Did you mean Ruger 7 6 2 sniper rifle?
It doesn 't matter if you shoot 3500 rounds
The key is how fast you can shoot
This gun is fast
Wind in the direction of the shot
Will the barrel get cold?
I hope so
Then you better be careful when you shoot
Yes

Adjust one point five cents to the right
shoot it
bingo
center red heart
I suggest you don 't change bullets
Continue to use 1 6 8 grain stern hollow shell if there are no obstacles to choose it
If you 're going to shoot through a thick window
I suggest you switch to 180 grains
But you have to recalculate the firing parameters
1 6 8 is enough
how many boxes
just a box
no more free
there 's one more thing
no offense
fine

can jimmy get me some water
Chuck, you 're awake
how do you . . .
can i have some water
I 'll get it


damn sorry

anything else


The last thing I remember is they put me in that machine
How long have I been in a coma
It 's been twenty hours
The next task is to get you out of this hell
where to go
Is the mental hospital in Las Cruces?
A place where you can actually hide me
go home Chuck you 're going home
Your heart is fine and the head injury is fine. That 's all I want to know.
What about a temporary emergency guardian?
Isn 't 'T' exactly what temporary means?
do you want to go to bed
no no this is cooler
what else do you need
I 'll make you some tea. Good tea is not the yellowish water in the hospital.
No
I 'm going to make tea for you
Jimmy don 't go
you just . . .
you have completed the task
you can go now
I 'm a little pushy
I was tortured in the hospital and now I just want to be by myself
If something goes wrong with your body, how can I know?
I 'm fine, I promise
did you see it
already feeling better
I don 't even have the key
can i call ernie back
At least let me do this for you
you need someone to look after you
you have to eat, don 't you?
All right
Get well soon Chuck

don 't do it
ok i 'll do it
I should be able to help you out next week.
have a nice day mr collins
correct
take out the sunglasses
it 's bright outside
have to protect the eyes
You have. . .
so handsome
that 's it
see you later
All right
Hi everyone, sorry for making you wait so long I take so long for each client which means sometimes you have to wait
But I promise you I will serve you in order
Ms. Dechezzo dear you are next
First of all, does anyone want coffee?
can i talk to you
Wait a mininute
We had to find a front desk yesterday.
Jimmy Howard just called
He said he was calling you all morning
Then how do you tell him to stop bothering you and leave a message for me
It 's Chuck 's business
He just said it was important
All right
I 'm sorry my colleague told me
I have a brief but urgent legal matter
I 'll make a call soon
who wants coffee
ok this young lady will pour you coffee and bagels if there are any
i want coffee without milk
Julie is me calling Howard back
right
What 's up
Jimmy I 'll just ask a question
Did you plan this?
what to plan
Jimmy, I 'm busy right now
- come back later - no no no
please open the door
I know why you came and we can talk about it later
i 'm busy
Are you satisfied?
I don 't even have the key here
Chuck
Chuck what 's going on

you made one . . .
you got a project
Do you want to tell me what 's going on?
can you tell me Chuck
These walls are plaster and slatted with absolutely no protection from radio waves
not at all
I might as well just stand in a meadow
I really don 't know what I thought
That 's how it should be from the start
You mean to do this for . . .
I think the walls are pretty solid
A metal shell prevents electromagnetic waves from entering
All I need is a Faraday cage that 's all I need
we should sit down for a while mate
I beg you
don 't come with me this set jimmy
I 'm not crazy
I never said you were crazy
You 're probably just exhausted. Forgivable

listen
just five minutes and then you go on with your
i 'm fine
come on Chuck
take a break
- be careful - i know

Howard said you resigned
i didn 't quit
I retired
It doesn 't sound like that
It 's so sudden anyway, don 't you think?
he 's worried about you
He should breathe a sigh of relief
breathe a sigh of relief
You are his pillar
Without you, the law firm will definitely get worse.
So you retired not only from Hamlyn McGill Associates but also from the legal profession?
This is not good Chuck
Lawyers need you
do not talk
you need it too
why Chuck
What can you do without being a lawyer?

How can you retire before you get me disbarred and kick me out of town
I 'll be the only one McGill in the legal profession.
how can you bear it
Is it because you failed to save Mesa Verde?
So who cares
And if you really think it 's me who stabbed you in the back, of course I didn 't, just casually.
do you know
You should be angry and you should get revenge
Don 't hide in your filthy cage, Faraday

no you should never retire
When you 're ninety-nine, you 're going to make closing arguments to a robotic judge and then fall to the ground and die, yes, that thing uses electricity.
This is your future, okay?
- So I

I can 't do this job
What do you mean you can 't do it?
I made a mistake
What is wrong
A small mistake got the bank address wrong
1 2 6 1 is written as 1 2 1 6
i screwed up
I caused the client to suffer losses
totally fucked up
And I blame it on you
Blame the damn current
Wear me out bit by bit, wear out my function
my mind my thinking it used to be
it used to be so nimble
But it doesn 't work now

someone got hurt because of me
it 's time to end
What if I told you you didn 't make a mistake
gosh jimmy stop comforting me
Don 't act like it 's not my fault

i betrayed you
I did it
Nixon must be proud of me
I changed 1 2 6 1 to 1 2 1 6
I did it
It happened just like you said
Exactly
I tampered with the file
Bought the guy at the print shop to lie for me
Every detail is as you expected, you are amazing
Now you can rest assured
Your brain works well, it 's full of horsepower
Are you telling the truth or are you just trying to make me feel better?
Of course to make you feel better
Otherwise, how could I say
But yeah it 's true
Are you going so hard just to humiliate me?
i 'm for gold
She won the Mesa Verde Bank without eating or sleeping
And you and Howard drink whiskey and sit back
What Hamlyn McGill Associates
It should be called Scrooge Marley for the miser in Dickens ' novel
Mesa Verde Bank is Gold
Neither you nor Hamlyn McGill Associates
she got it, she needed it
I did it to help her
But I really didn 't know it would hurt you that much
I thought you 'd just say 'I made a mistake on me' and get on with your life. That 's what normal people do
but you don 't
I made a mistake
So can I tell Howard that you are not quitting or retiring
And can you get these crap off the wall?
I 'll call Howard
Good rice
You just pleaded guilty to a felony, you know?
Forget it
But you feel better, don 't you?
After all, the two of us have nothing to say
