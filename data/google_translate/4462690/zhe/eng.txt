 - Tommy , about the electricity .
 - I know how it sounds but it 's real .
 I 'm picking up that driver .
 And if he knows you , that 's bad .
 The cops keeping it out of the papers .
 He wanted to put the cops onto Hector .
 - He forgot all about you .
 - I haven 't forgotten him .
 1216 Rosella Drive , Scottsdale , Arizona .
 This was no mistake .
 He sabotaged me .
 Remember me ?
 The answer is no .
 I know he was here .
 I know what he did .
 Father Brady 's in the chapel .
 Just push the call button if you want to see him .
 When was the last time you ate ?
 What ?
 Food .
 Have you had any lately ?
 I 'm fine .
 Come on , Chuck , let 's go over to Novi 's and stretch our legs , get some air , couple of hoagies .
 You want to get a sandwich ?
 Now ?
 Just a thought .

 Remember that time I accidentally invited
 Kathy and Cheryl to Mom 's surprise party ?
 It was , kind of , tricky out on the dance floor .
 It was a fun night .
 I just remember the whole family cleaning up after you .
 And Mom leaving her own birthday party to drive one of them home .
 Seriously , Chuck , we gotta eat .
 Mom 'll be okay for a few minutes .
 It 's been three days .
 It could be three more .
 Okay ?
 Let 's go , buddy .
 Jimmy , you want to eat , go eat .
 I 'll bring you something ... um , roast beef , no tomato , Italian on the side .
 All right ?
 ' Kay .
 Be right back .
 Mom ?
 Mom ?
 Jimmy .
 No , Mom , it 's me ...
 Chuck .
 Jimmy .
 No , Mom , it 's m ...
 So this is it , then ?
 I 'm sorry .
 She has that DNR .
 Is your brother in the building ?
 We can use the intercom .
 No .
 Charles ... is there anyone you want us to call ?
 H- Hey .
 Hey .
 Chuck .
 Hey , Chuck .
 Chuck , where 's Mom ?
 What happened ?
 She 's gone .
 What ?
 W- When ?
 How did ...
 Did she wake up ?
 Did she say anything ?
 No .

 Call 911 .
 Call 911 !
 Ernie , get out here ! Hey , what the hell are you doing ? ! - Hey !


 - Come back tomorrow . It 'll be half the price . Yeah , I need an ambulance .



 I got paper towels .
 Good . A guy came in , and now there 's blood , uh ...

 Um , yeah , hold on .
 Hold on one second .
 Chuck .
 Come on .
 Come on .

 Chuck .
 Hey , hey , hey .

 Hey .
 - We 're gonna get you to the hospital , okay ?
 - Lance . Everything will be all right .
 I work here .

 Hang tight , Charles .
 We 're almost there .

 Watch yourself .
 Coming through .

 On 3 .
 1 , 2 , 3 .
 Transferring .

 Okay .
 This is Charles McGill , late 50s .
 He had a syncopal episode at a print shop , witnessed by an employee .
 Estimated loss of consciousness was one minute . His vitals are stable .
 He 's got a laceration on his forehead that appears to need suturing .
 Charles , how you doing tonight ?
 Can you talk to me ? Seizure activity ?
 Not in transfer and none reported .
 No urinary incontinence .
 Do we have any family members ?
 - There 's a brother in the waiting room . - Okay .
 How much fluid did you give him ? - Mnh .
 - That 's the first liter .
 - Lights . - What 's that , Charles ?
 Mnh , you have to turn off the lights .
 - No , we can 't do that right now , sweetie .
 - Ohh ! God . - You fell and hit your head .
 - Mnh .
 We 're gonna need to do some tests , okay ?
 - No .
 - We can 't ...
 - We need the lights on to help you .
 - No . Charles , can you squeeze my hand really hard ?
 Turn the lights ...
 Mnh . What is that ?
 Okay , we 're just checking your oxygen there , Charles .
 - Ow ! - Do you have any allergies ? No .
 Are you on any medications ?
 Ohh , no .
 Mnh .
 Okay . I 'm gonna move your arms and legs ,
 - and you tell me if there 's any pain , okay ?
 - Ow . - Can we get an EKG ? - What ?
 To what ? Gentlemen , did we get an EKG ?
 - What ?
 - He 's on a five- lead now .
 - Okay .
 We didn 't get a 12- lead .
 - No . Okay , Tricia , we 're gonna need a 12- lead , please .
 No EKG ! No EKG ! Yes , Charles , we need to do o EKG okay ?

 - No , you don 't understand .
 - Charles . - I have a condition !
 - Charles , we need ...
 I have a hypersensitivity to electricity !

 Okay , but you need to lie still ...
 Charles , please push your feet against my hands . - so we examine your head and your neck ...
 - Very good . - make sure your heart 's all right , okay ?
 - Get these out of here .
 - No , you can 't touch this .
 - No , I ... I have a condition . - Tricia , can I get a light ?
 - I did not give you my consent .
 - You can 't touch that .
 - You have no right to do this !
 - We need to monitor your heart , okay ?
 - Get these out of here ! - Charles .
 - Just relax .
 - The lights , please . - Just relax . Please stay calm , Charles .

 Ohhh !
 Charles , you need to cooperate with us . This is gonna be very easy .
 We 're just gonna draw a little bit of blood , suture up your wound , and do a very simple CAT scan .
 - No ! No CAT scan ! - Okay , c- calm , calm .
 No CAT scan !
 Tricia , can we please get some restraints ?
 - You don 't understand !
 - Gentlemen , please come in here .
 - Please , turn off the lights .
 - You have to hold him down , restrain him .
 - Please turn off the lights !
 - Charles ...
 - Right here ... - We need you to calm down .
 - You 're killing me !
 - Calm down , Charles .
 Just gonna get them and figure it out for you .
 We got you .
 Just keep your head down .

 How 's he doing ?
 I 'd love to be able to tell you , but we can 't know for sure until we do those tests .

 You know what I 'm gonna say .
 Why can 't you just go old- school ... you know , look at his pupils , use a stethoscope ... that kinda thing ?
 He doesn 't want to be here .
 What he wants and what he needs are two very different things , Jimmy .
 We don 't know if he lost consciousness because of a heart- related issue or if it was a mild stroke .
 We don 't know if his spine has been injured if his brain is swelling .
 He likely has a concussion , at least .
 Chuck is once again refusing these tests because they involve being bombarded by electricity ... his words .
 Nothing has changed since the last time he was in here .
 Look , I don 't know how to explain this any clearer .
 I 'm not committing him .

 What about a Temporary Emergency Guardianship ?
 I mean , he fits the parameters .
 You 're telling me he 's in need of medical care so urgent that we can 't wait around on court procedure .
 - Most certainly . - Yeah .
 And Chuck is not able to understand the consequences .
 I mean , he can understand them , but he ...
 Absolutely .
 A judge will see it that way , too .
 And then I take him home , and it 's over .
 Pending results and proper treatment , yes .
 I know a judge we can call right now .
 Let me be the one to tell him .
 Hey , buddy .
 How 's it going ?

 Chuck .
 Well , if it isn 't Johnny- on- the- spot . What ?
 What does that mean ?
 Is Ernesto out there ?
 Yeah .
 Can I get you something ?
 Ernesto !
 Come in here , please !
 Look , just take it easy .
 Ernesto !
 Just put your stuff in there .

 I got him .
 How are you feeling ' , Mr. McGill ?
 Ernesto , how long was I unconscious in that print shop ?
 I 'm not sure .
 30 seconds , a minute ?
 - 2 minutes ? - I 'd say maybe about a minute .
 You were kinda in and out .
 And how long was I lying on the floor before the ambulance arrived ?
 About 10 minutes , I think , t I didn 't look at the clock .
 And yet , you were there .
 Chuck , can we , uh ...
 There 's only one way you could have gotten there so quickly ... you never left .

 I think you 're getting all wound up .
 Can you just take a few deep br ...
 You bribed him ... that kid behind the counter .
 What ?
 Between the time Ernesto left and I arrived , you paid that half- wit to swear
 - he 'd never laid eyes on you . - Mr. McGill .
 And then you stuck around to watch .
 Why ? Just wanted to see me suffer ?
 - Hmm ?
 - Mr. McGill .
 Just wanted to have a laugh at my expense ?
 I called him .

 What ?
 I called Jimmy earlier , before I picked you up .
 He showed up when he did because I called him .
 I was worried about you , and I just ...
 I called him .
 I 'm sorry .

 Get out ...
 Both of you .
 Chuck , there 's something that I have to do , and I 'm really sorry ...
 Really , truly sorry , but I gotta do it , and it 's for you .
 You 're trying to have me committed .
 No , it 's a Temporary ...
 Temporary Emergency Guardianship ... to- may- to , to- mah- to .
 Well , you 've finally got me where you want me .
 Hey , you look beat .
 Why don 't you go home and get some sleep ?
 I 'm fine to hang out , you know ?
 Whatever you need . Nah .
 We 're good here .


 Hey , Ernie .
 Uh , how come you said that about calling ' me ?
 I don 't know , man .
 Look , I didn 't want to say anything , but your brother ... the way he 's been talking ' about you lately ... it 's like ...
 He 's really out to get you , Jimmy .
 And ...
 I don 't know . You 're my friend .

 Thanks .

 I 'll call you tomorrow .
 I miss the mailroom .
 Are you familiar with the Hippocratic oath ? You should be .
 One of the oldest binding documents in history .
 Primum non nocere ...
 First , do no harm . This is not the way to treat my condition .
 It 's as though I had a ... an allergy to penicillin , and yet , you persist on treating my infection with it .
 I appreciate the analogy , Charles , but I don 't think it quite fits .
 Look , we 'll have you in and out of Radiology before you know it , all right ?
 Then we can see about getting that neck collar off and get you moving around .

 Okay , Charles , the scan is starting now .
 The table that you 're on is going to move .
 You 're gonna hear a sound that might seem loud to you , but it 's nothing to worry about .

 Still no word ?
 Jesus .
 How long is this gonna take ?
 She said that whole test would be like 10 minutes .
 Maybe they had to start over .
 What ... 20 times ?
 He should be home .
 Jimmy , you 're doing ' the right thing .

 Would you get your work out , please ?
 Because God knows how much longer we 're gonna be here .
 I 'd feel better if you were doing something , you know , unhospital- y .
 Unhospital- y .
 I 'm on it .

 You know what ?
 - I 'm gonna go ask for an update .
 - Okay . Good idea .
 You are the greatest generation .
 - Jimmy . - What ?
 You didn 't start World War Il , but you sure as heck finished it .
 And if that weren 't enough , you sent a rocket 300 feet tall to the moon .
 Now , in your golden years , you need someone looking out for you , someone you can trust , a man who says what he does and does what he says .

 When you need someone to count on ...
 - Gimme Jimmy ! - Gimme Jimmy !
 Gimme Jimmy !
 Because moxie is in such short supply these days .
 Jimmy McGill ...
 A lawyer you can trust . It 's really good , Jimmy .
 You made a really good commercial .
 Thanks .

 Jimmy .
 Oh , finally .
 So , how is he ?
 Well , the good news is that , physically , he 's okay .
 The radiologist said everything looks normal with Charles ' head and spine , so we took his neck collar off .
 His head wound will heal just fine .
 We gave him a tenus shot because his immunization records were not current .
 I 'm sure that 's no surprise to you . And ... And ...
 And his heart ? Strong .
 The EKG was normal .
 As far as losing consciousness , my best guess is
 Charles had what 's called a stress- related syncope .
 It 's basically a panic attack , but no signs of a stroke or cardiac event .
 However , there was ... a complication .
 Chuck ?
 Hey , buddy , it 's me .
 They said everything looks good , so let 's get you outta here .
 What do you say ?

 What 's wrong with him ?
 Whatever you gave him should 've worn off already , right ?
 We watched him for several hours .
 We even gave him what 's called a reversal agent .
 So , yes , the sedative wore off .
 - This is something else .
 - What ? We think it 's a state of self- induced catatonia .
 " We " ... always with the " we . "
 I think it 's you . You 're the only doctor in the room .

 I think you fried his brain with that machine .
 Jimmy . I 'm sorry . This is bullshit .
 Jimmy .

 What next ?
 When I first treated Charles , he was in a similar state . Wouldn 't you agree ?

 I have to believe that it 's just a matter of time before he comes out of it . Matter of time .
 Fine , then .
 I 'll wait right here .

 Shot left .
 1 . 5 minutes .

 How many rounds 've gone through the tube ? For a 762 ?
 You can put 3, 500 through it and never know .
 It 's about how tight she shoots .
 And this one 's tight as they come .
 I 'd say there 's a breeze picking up downrange .
 Your barrel gonna be cold ?
 Let 's suppose so .
 Well , then , you 'd better have paid attention to that shot . Uh- huh .
 I 'd better have .
 Adjusting right , 1 . 5 minutes .
 Send it .

 Hit .
 Center hit .

 I suggest you don 't change up your ammo .
 Stick with the 168 grain boat- tail hollow point ... if it 's an open shot , that is .
 Now , if you got to shoot through a heavy window ,
 I 'll up you to a 180 .
 But as you know , you 'll have to recalculate the shot .
 168 will do it .
 How many boxes ?
 Just the one .

 No , it 's on the house .
 Uh , one last thing .

 No offense .

 None taken .
 Ohh .
 Jimmy , can I get some water ? Chuck .
 Hey , buddy , you 're back with us .
 How you ... Can I get some water , please ?

 Yeah , yeah , water .
 Mnh .
 Mnh .
 Oh , shit .
 Sorry .

 Want some more ?
 Mm .
 Oh .
 Last thing I remember was that machine they put me in .
 How long was I out for ?
 Was ... 20 hours .
 And next order of business ... get you the hell outta here .
 Where to next ?
 Some insane asylum in Las Cruces ? Someplace you can really tuck me away , but good ?
 Home , Chuck .
 You 're going ' home .
 Well , your heart 's okay , and so is that crack on your head , so that 's all I wanted to know .
 What about the T. E. G. ?
 The " T " stands for " Temporary , " right ?
 You wanna go to bed ?
 No , no . It 's ...
 It 's cooler down here .
 What can I get you ?
 I 'll make you some tea ... uh , the good stuff , not that brown water they have at the hospital .
 I 'm fine .
 I 'll make you some tea .
 Jimmy . No .

 Just ...
 You 've done your duty .
 You can go now .
 That came out a bit harsh .
 Look , I 've been zapped and poked and prodded , and now I just I wanna be left alone .
 If things start going south for you again , how am I even gonna know ? I 'm fine .
 I promise .

 See ?
 Feeling better already .
 I mean , I don 't even have a key , so ...
 Can I get Ernie back here ?
 Would you let me do that for you , at least ?
 You need someone looking ' in on ya .
 You gotta eat , right ?
 All right .
 Feel better , Chuck .

 Por favor !

 All right , I will get right on that . I should have it for you by early next week .
 You have yourself a wonderful day , Mr. Collins .

 Oh !
 There you go .
 Yeah , get the sunglasses out .
 It 's very bright .
 Gotta protect the old ' peepers .
 You gotta ...
 Yep , looking sharp .
 Bingo .
 Uh , bye- bye , now .
 Okay .
 Folks , I 'm sorry about the wait , but the attention I give each client means sometimes , things get a little ... backed up .
 Uh [ breathes sharply ] but I promise to get to each and every one of you in turn .
 Mrs. DeShazo , my dear , I believe you 're next .
 But first , may I get anybody some coffee ?
 Can I talk to you ?
 Uh , excuse me one second .
 We have got to get a receptionist ... like , yesterday .
 Jimmy , Howard just called .
 He says he has been trying to reach you all morning .
 So ?
 Tell him to stop bothering you and leave me a message .
 It 's about Chuck .
 It 's important ...
 That 's all he 'll say .
 Okay .
 Unfortunately , uh , my associate tells me
 I 'm needed for some brief but pressing legal business .
 I just need to make one quick phone call .
 Uh , in the meantime , who was it who wanted coffee ?
 Yeah , okay , uh , this young lady will get you coffee ... and , also , doughnuts if there are any left .

 I want coffee , but I do not want cream . Hey , Julie , it 's me , returning Howard 's call .
 Yeah .

 Hey , what 's up ?
 Jimmy , I have just one question ...
 Are you behind this ?
 Am I behind what ?

 Jimmy , I 'm kind of in the middle of something ' right now . - Come back later . - No , no , no .
 Come on .
 Open the door .
 I know why you 're here .
 We can discuss it later .
 Right now I 'm busy .
 Goodbye .

 You happy now ?

 It 's not right ...
 Me not having ' a key to this place .
 Chuck ?

 So , Chuck ... uh , what 's up ?
 Um ...
 You got a little , uh ...
 You got a little , uh , uh , project going ' on ?
 Uh , something you maybe wanna tell me about ?
 What do you say Chuck ?
 Clue me in ?
 These walls are plaster and lath ... completely invisible to the radio spectrum .
 No protection at all ...
 I might as well be standing in the middle of a pasture .
 I don 't know what I was thinking .
 I should 've done this from the start .
 What , you should 've done this , with the , uh ...
 See , I think these walls are pretty solid .
 I think ...
 See , what I really need is a proper Faraday cage .
 That 's what I need .
 I think we need to sit down , take a break , buddy .
 Please ? Do not patronize me , Jimmy .

 I 'm not crazy , all right ?
 What ? I never said you were crazy .
 You 're probably exhausted , a- and justifiably .
 That ...
 Hey , come on . Hey .
 Five minutes , and then right back at it .
 I 'm fine .
 Come on , Chuck .
 Just a break .

 - Careful .
 - I know .
 Ohh .
 Howard tells me you quit HHM . I didn 't quit .
 I retired .
 That 's not what it sounded like .
 Regardless , it 's kinda out of the blue , don 't you think ?
 He 's worried about you .
 He should be relieved .
 Relieved ? Why would he be relieved ?
 You 're his Number One Guy .
 Without you , that whole place goes down the drain .
 So , you ... you retired ... not just from HHM , but the law ?

 That 's not good , Chuck .
 The ...
 The law ... needs you . Just stop it .
 And you need it .
 What brought this on exactly , Chuck ?
 Huh ?
 ' Cause I don 't know what you are if you 're not a lawyer .
 Hey ...
 How are you gonna retire before you get me disbarred , before you run me out of the town on a rail , huh ?
 I 'll be the only McGill carrying the family name .
 You can 't have that .

 Is this ...
 Cause you lost Mesa Verde ? So what ?
 Who cares ?
 And , hey , if you truly do think that I ratfucked you on that thing ... which I did not , but whatever ... well , you know what ?
 You get mad !
 Take action !
 Don 't just hide out in your ... your Faraday whatever ... your cage thing here .
 No !
 You ... No retirement for you !
 When you 're 99 , you can drop dead giving closing arguments to JudgeBot 3000 ... which will run on electricity , by the way .
 That 's your future , okay ?
 - So ...
 - I ...
 I can 't do the job anymore . What do you mean ? Of course you can do the job .
 I made a mistake . What mistake ?
 A simple , nothing little bank address ...
 - 1216 instead of 1261 .
 - Oh . I screwed it up ! I hurt the client .

 Blew it completely and utterly .
 And then I blamed ...
 And then I blamed you .
 It 's this goddamned electricity ! It 's wearing me down !
 It 's wearing down my faculties !
 My brain ... my mind ... it used to be ...
 You know , it used to work !
 And now it doesn 't anymore . Mnh .
 People got hurt because of me .
 Time to end it .
 What if I told you you didn 't make a mistake ?
 For Christ 's sakes , Jimmy , stop humoring me .
 Stop trying to talk everything right .

 Mnh .
 I ratfucked you .

 It was me .
 I would 've made Nixon proud .
 I changed 1261 to 1216 . It was me .
 It all went down exactly like you said ...
 I mean , exactly . I doctored the copies .
 I paid the kid at the shop to lie for me .
 It is insane how you got every detail exactly right .
 So you can relax , okay ?
 ' Cause that brain of yours is chugging along at 1, 000 % efficiency .
 Are you telling the truth , or are you just trying to make me feel better ?
 I am saying ' it to make you feel better .
 I sure as shit wouldn 't be telling you otherwise .
 But , yes ...
 It 's the truth .
 You 'd go to such lengths to humiliate me ? I did it for Kim !
 What ...
 She worked her butt off to get Mesa Verde while you and Howard sat around sipping scotch and chortling .
 Hamlin , Hamlin , McGill ...
 More like Scrooge and Marley !
 Kim deserves Mesa Verde ...

 Not you , not HHM .
 She earned it , and she needs it !
 I did it to help her , but I ...
 I honestly didn 't think it would hurt you so bad .
 I thought you 'd just say , " Oh , crap , I made a mistake , " and go on with your life , like a normal person !
 But , oh , no !
 Wishful thinking !

 So , can I , uh , tell Howard you 're not quitting or retiring or whatever ?

 And can we take all this shit down off the walls ?
 I 'm gonna go call Howard .
 Jimmy .

 You do realize you just confessed to a felony ? I guess .
 But you feel better , right ?
 Besides , it 's your word against mine .
