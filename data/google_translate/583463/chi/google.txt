Oh, it 's really cool that you beat Mike with a ping pong ball. Do you want . . . . . that?
uh, i mean, but i 'm a little tired
- I 'll wrap my head in a pillowcase. - Then come on!
- Hi! - What 's up?
Mike is showering by the way, we haven 't done that yet . . .
I want to go get something to eat, so if you guys want too...
Is that Ross?
Yes, that broken wall can 't contain any sound.
- As if someone was with him. - I think should not be
This morning I heard him do push-ups and then talk to his triceps.
Wait, I think Phoebe is right.
I also heard someone with him.

- Dr. Geller! - Gosh, it 's incredible. . . . . .
I just wanted you to call me that.
- Oh my gosh, it 's Charlie! - He fucks Joey and Ross behind his back!
oh that bitchy . . . big . . . slut . . . . . . . .
- I shouldn 't have - yes, you 're right.
It 's none of our business at all.
No, I should find a way to eavesdrop. Give me a glass!
Oh, I wouldn 't do that. I will not eavesdrop on my friends.
Oh . . . . . . I love Barbados!



Oh . . . . . I can 't believe I 'm kissing you. I 'm kissing Rachel!
I know, I am her!

Rachel and Joey! It 's Rachel and Joey! ! !
- what? - Come over here!


Oh my gosh, I love these thin walls!


thanks.


Hey, why did you change your mind when you said we were impossible?
I said this before because Ross . . .
- But then I saw him kissing Charlie . . . . . .
- what?
Ross and Charlie?
Wow! She really wants to join us, eh?
- Ah, what are you talking about? - what. . . .
Can 't believe it, Rachel and Joey?
What about the dinosaur duo over there?
- No one is responsible for that wall! - and me!

- What did you hear? - I think I heard them pulling the curtains . . .
We heard shoes kicked off the box spring, can 't go wrong!
- Did you ever think that 's your brother? - You only think about it when you say it. Find someone to replace me!
etc!
Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel,
Phoebe and Mike! We 're the only couple who haven 't changed each other!
no! I came with Monica but went with Weird Al.
Well, I 'm fed up with this hair joke.
- Tomorrow morning, I 'll go to the hair salon before we go. - Okay, Buckwheat Man!

You guys should listen to this, it 's awesome. . . . . . It 's like free porn!




- Uh . . . . . what 's the matter? - Yeah, just . . . . . . I don 't think I can do that. . . . . .
Oh . . . . . . Is it because of lying on the bedspread?
- I 've seen those reports too, under infrared and . . .
- no no!
Do not.
Uh, I 'm going to talk to Joey. You just broke up.
Before anything happens between us, I want to make sure he doesn 't object.
- I, uh . . . . . I totally get it. - Well, I think I 'm going to find him. . . . . .


I think . . . . . . I need some time. . . get me that. . . . . .

Granny . . . Granny . . . Granny . . .



- All right, see you later. - OK. . . . . .
The door slams and he 's gone . . .
And she... turned on the TV... . . . . .
Watching . . . The Pageant.
Darling, if you can even hear this then you know too much!

Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, we 're . . . . . . we 're going away soon, and we 're sad so we 're saying goodbye to this hotel.
I love you. . . . . .
Paradise Inn Golf Resort and Water Bath . . . . . .
Yes, we had a great time, thanks!


goodbye!
OK , uh . . . . . . Hey, did you see where Joey is?
He should be in his room by now with his current girlfriend Charlie.
Here 's what we know. . . . . .
Well, if you see him, tell him I 'm looking for him, okay?
- no problem! - Thanks!
Thank you!


The other side of the wall, man! the other side!


- Rachel, are you there? - Oh my god, it 's Ross.
- How to do? - Oh, Paul- Paul- keep calm. Keep calm.
We just chat casually.
okay? Feel free.


- It 's not random! - I don 't know what that means.

Oh . . . . . . well, hide!
- Rachel? - Here we go! Try to get out of bed!

The bottom of the bed is not high enough.
- What happened? - No. . . . . .

- Hey. - Hi . . . - did you know Joey was there?
I really do not know. . . . . .


- Can I talk to you? - of course can. . . . . .
I can 't believe it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

Then she told me she broke up with Joey
In part because she has feelings for me.
uh uh . . . . . . yes . . . . . . . . . . .
You know, the day I met Charlie, I wanted to ask her out.
Oh, I get it. . . . . I know it 's hard for you.
Anyway, one thing after another, and . . . . . .
Oh . . . . . . not sure what happened yet, we kissed.
How angry do you think Joey would be? 4 9 0 0 0 : 0 8 : 1 0 , 9 2 3 - -&gt; 0 0 : 0 8 : 1 4 , 5 5 2 It 's hard to say, Ross. It 's hard to say.

I 'm going to find him. He must be somewhere.
That 's right!




Joey !
- Is he gone? - how did you do that?

How . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What about you guys . . . . . what 's going on here? Have you been listening?
right!
So, what 's going on here?
Ah, what 's going on here? Well, let 's just say we kissed for ten minutes
And now talking to a friend about it I think only 6th graders do this!
Oh no. . . . . . Have you ever thought how complicated this could get?
- What about Ross? - But he 's with Charlie now.
Yes, but he wants to talk to you before we get started.
As friends, don 't you think you should do the same?
You 've touched my sore spot, Gellers!

ok thanks for your comments
But it 's between me and Joey, we can handle it . . . . . .
Well, we 're going back, can you do something for us? For these friends who care about you . . .
- Of course. . . . . .
- Go and make it clear!
go out!


what do you think? Maybe, yes. . . . . . I mean


We should make it clear with him first.
Yes . . . . . . Yes, we can wait until we do nothing tonight.
Yes, I think it 's best... . . . . .
Well, then I 'm going. . . . . I 'm leaving. . . . . .
- unless. . . . . .
- I like 'unless'! I mean
Rose and I have been close to . . . .
Haven 't dated in 6 years.
6 years?
Wow. . . . . . as long as high school. . . . . .

And, he 's with Charlie now.
That 's right!
- He doesn 't have feelings for you anymore. - Yes.
I just have feelings for you . . .
right. . . . . .
- Let 's forget about Ross . . . . . .
- Forgot.

- What 's up? - fine. . . . . .
Seriously . . . . . . What 's wrong?

It 's alright. . . . . . Really . . . . . . .
What 's wrong?
Sorry, I 'm just, uh. . . . .
Looks like I can 't ignore Ross . . . . . .
Well, let me help you.



Oh, your lips are so soft . . . again . . . . .
You 're right . . . we really need to talk to Ross . . . . . .
Hi! Are you ready to go?
not yet. Monica 's still in the salon, and I 'm not ready yet.
man! Aren 't you going to bring your bible?
You shouldn 't take this away.
And it 's the new covenant, what do you want it for? Learn about Jesus . . . . .

- Hi! - Did you tell Joey?
Uh, no. . . . . . not yet. I can 't find her. I 'll talk to him on the plane.
Yes, that sounds good. . . . . . Dr. Geller! Don 't say that!
P H D
You are so horny! - Hey, have you met Monica? - Uh, I think she went to the hair salon. Oh yes, oh, she just went to the salon . . . . .
take a look!
Who will like this the most?
Chandler!
Hey! . . ah ah ah !
- what do you think? - I think. . . . . .
I think I can see your scalp.
Do you not like it?
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . You hang the shells on your head.
It 's so... that 's it... go girl!
- You never said that before, did you? - More than once.
I think so too.
- Phoebe? - Glad you did!
listen to this . . . . . .

do you know? . . . It 's a real treat for sight. . . and hearing.




Oh, oh. Wow, it 's so embarrassing to have to sit next to Charlie after I broke up with her.
That said, Air Barbados really doesn 't care about your private life.
Hey, does anyone want to sit with Charlie for me?
I . . . . . . Hey! Dude, Charlie and I were in the whole meeting.

- I understand . . . . . . - No, I want it.
I also want to exchange with someone. I really don 't want to sit there with Allen Iverson (basketball star).


- Hey! - Hey!
uh. . . . . . you know, when our captain turned off the seatbelt sign after liftoff. . . . . . .
You can roam freely in my cabin. . . . . . .
Be careful when you check your suitcase
- It 's easy to get confused with other people 's. - No, I think I can stay the night.

It 's Saturday, isn 't it? What 's wrong?
- Uh . . . . . . I can 't tonight. - why?
I have a date.

- You have a . . . . . . You have a date? with whom? - Oh, yes. . . . . . my girlfriend.

- You have a . . . . . . you have a girlfriend? - yes. . . . . uh
Before we broke up, I started dating other people.
- That . . . how long has it been? - 3 months.
3 months ?
All right. . . . . .
It 's probably none of my business, just uh... how long do you think you 'll be with her?

At dinner tonight, I 'll tell her it 's over. I promise.
Oh well . . . . . . . . then you go.
Then when you get home there may be a special parcel waiting for you there.
I may sign for it. rip it open.
- Rip off the packing material . . . . . .
- You know what, we 'll have sex. you don 't need to say anymore

This is our last look at Barbados!
It is also the last time I see everything in the world.

Well, I 'm going to talk to Joey. I think now is the time.
The flight attendant is always in a good mood after saying 'dutyfree'. [Note: Joey sounds doodyfree (just do it)]
Well, good luck!
You know, if he can 't take it, nothing can happen between us
I know. Well, if that 's the case I want you to know . . . 6 0 2 0 0 : 1 5 : 3 9 , 9 3 9 - -&gt; 0 0 : 1 5 : 4 3 , 6 0 2 I think I might Already love you very, very deeply 0 0 : 1 5 : 4 8 , 9 1 4 - -&gt; 0 0 : 1 5 : 5 0 , 8 4 8 Then . . . you know . . . Forget it 6 0 5 0 0 : 1 5 : 5 5 , 0 8 7 - - &gt; 0 0 : 1 5 : 5 8 , 4 2 0 Ross is coming. I think now would be a good time to tell him.







I think so. It 's just... I 'm so nervous.
Well, you think like this: After you say
They were served.
Still nervous?
I want to eat lasagna.
- Hi Rachel . . . . . . - What!
- Do you mind if I sit here for a while? - I don 't mind, of course not! Do not!
good luck!
- Hi! - Hi!
I, uh . . . . .
I have something to tell you about Charlie.
- how? - Well, after you two broke up last night...
Of course I feel sorry... uh
Charlie and I confided and then... uh
You are kissing.
Wow. . . . . . what?
Why do you think so?
- I saw it. - Yes, we kissed
But . . . nothing happened, you know.
- Ross . . . . . . it 's okay. - what?
it does not matter. I totally understand, okay? you
You suit her better than me. do you know? And . . . . . . - I wish you all happiness. - real?
Of course. . . . . .
- I also have something to say. . . . . .
- I 'm really speechless. . . . . .
You actually put my happiness first. I mean
You are such an unbelievably good friend you know that?
- oh. . . . . uh. . . . . uh. . . . . .
- No, I mean it.
You are loyal, selfless and generous... . . . .

I am, of course I am.
do you know? I 've known Chandler longer and I 've always regarded him as my best friend

But now . . . . . . I think I should reconsider . . . . . .

man!
Hey, is there anything I can help with?


not yet. . . . . .

- thanks! - nothing!
- Hi! - Hi!
- You, uh, you talked to Joey? - Ah, yes. We had a great time chatting.
- Oh! marvelous! - right!
- Oh, is everything okay? - Oh no, it 's just awesome.
- marvelous. He 's really . . . he 's amazingly good. - Ah. . . . . . um, apparently I think so too.
Yes, I am very excited.
real? excited?
Are you kidding me? I 'm dreaming about doing that now. . . . . .

Step aside!


You didn 't say yes?
I can 't tell. He talked me into hype.
I don 't want to piss him off and take back what he said. I 'm about to take Chandler 's place.
Alright alright! When I got back to New York, I told him.
thanks. Really, I am very grateful.



- Hi, Mike 's. - Hey, it 's Mike. - Oh, so fast. - Oh, uh... no, she 's not here yet.

You know, I think I should go and I can say goodbye to her on the phone.
No, you can 't go! Fasten yourself with something!
Why don 't you just tell her we 're together again. You know, women appreciate honesty.
Also likes a gentle slap.
One more thing . . . . . . maybe. . . . . . There 's a picture of Precious on my coffee stand.
Her name is Precious ?
Is she purebred? You picked her in the cage?

- Anyway, I just wanted to let you know. - Well, oh, if she 's sad
Remember to tickle her belly to make her happy



You know another blonde.


Hi, I 'm Precious, who are you?
- I . . . . . I 'm Phoebe. - Phoebe?
Mike 's ex-girlfriend Phoebe? The love of his life? That Phoebe?
Oh, I really want my colleagues to take a look at this soon. . . .
- You 're going back to work tomorrow night, aren 't you? - right!
then if you want them to see
So you 're not going to take them off tonight?
Well, if I get it out, I can 't do it.
you like it, don 't you?


- What do you sing? - Polly from 'Perfect'.
That 's Wagner the Zealot from Apocalypse Now.
Here 's the thing: These shells are for your frizzy hair.
And now that we 're home, we don 't have that problem anymore so if you think about it . . . I hate them!
- what? You said what you liked. - Did I say so? Let 's think back.
I think what I said was 'I can see your scalp'.
Well, then you don 't like it. But everyone else likes it.
Thinking again, makes us want to go back to that tour. . . . I remember Rachel saying she never noticed the shape of your skull before.
And Joey . . . Joey couldn 't see any difference in you at the time.
do you know? I do not care. I like it, I like it, and I 'm going to keep it.
You 're jealous because your hair can 't do that. . . . . . .  - Knock on your tooth? - And eyes!
Hi . . . . . she 's here. Hi Ai Ma. Oh my god, I miss you.
Oh Ai, I miss you so much, hi!
Hey . . . . . . Are you having a good time with your grandma? Uh?
Did she give you a stimulant while she was chatting? Only once, Roth, and only 5 mg.
Oh hey, Ai, Daddy has a present for you. do you know?
I want you to wait here for a while, wait, baby.
Uh . . . . . Ross I actually have something to tell you.
Okay, let 's talk!
- Well, uh... well, here it is. - Oh no!
- What 's up? what is that? - Oh, the big bottle of shampoo broke!
- Uh, listen Ross, it 's hard to say. - what! ! Also sticking everywhere.
Why? Why is it me?
Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?
I guess these things are too precious to me.
sorry Sorry. What did you say?
- Well, uh... well, listen, it 's about me and . . . . . .
- Oh no, another bottle! ?
Oh my gosh... it 's mousse. This one is even harder to clean up!
Why? Why do bad things always fall on good people?
- Wow! Well, obviously this is not a good time. - Well, what do you think? !
Okay, bye.
Well, Mike has returned.
You know, you thought you were meeting him here but you thought you were meeting him in a restaurant
So . . . . . . it doesn 't matter who 's right and who 's wrong is that . . . . . I 'm leaving.
I won 't let you go until you tell me what the hell happened.
I mean, did you guys make it up or what?
All right. . . . . .
Susie, can I call you Susie?
My name is Precious.
Yes, but I can 't speak.
Uh . . . . . Susie, I want to be straight with you. . . . . .
Mike and I made up. . . . . . and, uh. . . . . . unfortunately
This will end your relationship.
And he 's sorry about that, and wishes you the best of luck.
I can 't believe it. . . . . . why?
- I don 't know about this either. . . . . .
- Oh, why did he do that?
- What am I did wrong? - No, you did nothing wrong.
I mean, what am I supposed to do now?
hateful! You woman, calm down, calm down.
Keep your dignity, for God 's sake!
Well, you don 't seem to like bitter love.
I really don 't understand why he didn 't give me some hints first!
What he didn 't know was that he had no plans to come to Barbados to propose to me . . .
Did he propose to you? My birthday sucks.
Listen, Precious . . . . . .
You don 't feel sorry for Mike. you are a charming and smart girl
You see Mike is a bit of an asshole.
I mean he was even with you when he proposed to me . . .
He actually wants to break up with you on your birthday?
And, I didn 't mean to say it but he cheated on you too much this weekend.
Oh my gosh, maybe you 're right. Maybe I don 't need him.
I should be respected.
You bastard, Mike. You cowardly bastard, I want you to rot in hell.
no need to thank me!
Honey, you 've been in there for a long time. . . . . . are you okay?
There is something.
I have an accident.
Yeah? What 's wrong?
Well, I 'm dancing to No Woman, No Cry . . .
Then it hung up.
- Can 't move at all? - Oh no, I can move . . .
If I untie you, will you untie this ear of rice?
I would like to . . . . . .
- Some look tangled up. - Yes, I tried to unravel it myself.
- Hi! - Hi!
- Uh . . . . . did you tell Ross? - no, i want to say
But there was an accident with his shampoo.
- So I guess it 's your turn. - no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. . . . . .
I think you 'd better go and tell him, you know it 's easier for women.
You know, if he 's crazy you can... 7 6 3 0 0 : 2 7 : 5 5 , 5 7 3 - -&gt; 0 0 : 2 7 : 5 7 , 8 0 3 I didn 't mean to of.
I 'm so sorry.
Yes, we do
Well, well, like this, uh. . . . . like this, how about this?
Tomorrow . . . . . . Let 's go together tomorrow and tell him together.
Well, that sounds fair.
- But then we can 't . . . . . .
- I know I know. . . . . .
But no problem. We have self-control, we are not animals.
- Of course, of course we can wait. - Yes.
So I guess it 's time to say good night?
OK! Good night!
Good night!
Good night!
- Seriously, good night! - Don 't say good night.
OK. I 'm so sorry...
Look what I found in the drawer . . . . . .
You also said I would never wear it.
I rescued you, you haven 't repaid me yet?
- Of course, how do you want me to repay? - You should know.
- real? But I kinda don 't want to. - I just want to.
All right.
I don 't know why you like it so much.
She 's an FBI agent and she 's in a beauty pageant.
