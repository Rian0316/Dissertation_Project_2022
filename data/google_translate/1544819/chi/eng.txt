 So two years later , there 's a knock on the door . Guy opens it , and there on his porch is the snail who says , " What the heck was all that about ? "
 ( both laughing )
 I don 't really get it .
 Well , see , it took two years for the snail ...

 Not important .
 Can I ask you a question ?
 Sure .
 Where do you think this is going ?

 To be honest , I was hoping at least second base .
 You 're so funny .
 You 're like a stand- up comedian .
 A Jewish stand- up comedian , that 'd be new .
 Actually , I think a lot of them are Jewish .
 No , I was just ...
 Never mind . Look , Howard , this is our third date .
 We both know what that means . We do ? Sex .

 You 're kidding .
 But I need to know whether you 're looking for a relationship or a one- night stand .
 Okay , just to be clear : there 's only one correct answer , right ?
 It 's not like " chicken or fish " on an airplane ?
 Maybe you need to think about it a little .
 You know , it 's not unheard of for a one- night stand to turn into a relationship .
 Call me when you figure it out .
 Three dates means sex ?
 Who knew ?

 Greetings , homies .
 Homette .
 Why are you back from your date so early ?
 In romance , as in show business , always leave them wanting more .
 What exactly does that mean ?
 He struck out .
 * Our whole universe was in a hot , dense state * * Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started ... Wait ! *
 * The Ear began to cool
 * The autotrophs began to drool , Neanderthals developed tools *

 * Math , Science , History , unraveling the mystery *
 * That all started with a big bang *

 Hey , did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex ? Actually , I 've never had three dates with the same woman .
 With Penny and me , it took two years .
 Now that I think about it , that was three dates .
 Okay , well , before you and Penny hooked up , did she ask for any kind of commitment ?
 No , she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open .
 I have something to announce , but out of respect for convention , I will wait for you
 To finish your current conversation . What are you talking about ?
 The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates .
 I see .
 Now , are we talking " date , " the social interaction , or " date , " the dried fruit ?
 Never mind , what 's your announcement ? Oh , good , my turn .
 Well , this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know ...
 Hey , Cooper .
 I hear you 're going To be on the radio
 Thank you , Kripke , for depriving me of the opportunity My pleasure .
 My " thank you " was not sincere .
 But " my pleasure " is .
 Let me ask you a question : at what point did National Public Radio have to start scraping the bottom of the barrel for its guests
 Don 't answer .
 It 's rhetorical . Why are you such a stupid head ?
 That is also rhetorical .
 I 'm sorry you had to hear that .
 Are you really going to be on NPR ?
 Yes , they 're interviewing me by phone from my office , regarding the recent so- called " discovery " of magnetic monopoles in spin- ices .
 It 's pledge week and they 're trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy . Very cool , congratulations .
 Thank you . My mother is very excited .
 and then pray for my soul .
 I was on the radio once .
 I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays :
 That means :
 " Fever 104 , home of the really good current music . " It 's much catchier in Hindi .

 All right . These are the talking points for NPR interview tomorrow .
 I need to make sure that they 're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand .
 Howard , look this over and tell me what 's unclear to you .
 Excuse me , I have a master 's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
 It required the completion of 144 units of grad work Yes .
 Look this over and tell me what 's unclear to you .
 You know , when Sheldon gives you homework , you don 't have to do it .
 In fact , it 's better if you don 't , otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad . Hi , guys .
 Hey .
 Hello . Yo , Raj , talk to me .

 I 'm sorry , just screwing with you .
 Hey , Howard , why haven 't you called Bernadette ? Did she say something ?
 Yeah , she said she hasn 't heard from you in a week .
 I thought you liked her ?
 I do , but she wants a commitment and I 'm not sure she 's my type .
 She agreed to go out with you for free .
 What more do you need ? Look , Bernadette is really nice .
 I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship , it would be with someone , you know , different .
 Different how ?

 Or Katee Sackhoff
 Are you high ?
 You 'd have a better shot with the three- breasted
 Okay , now you 're just being unrealistic .
 Anyway , that movie was like 20 years ago .
 Imagine how saggy those things would be .

 Howard , you 're going to throw ay a great girl like Bernadette because you 're holding out for some ridiculous fantasy ?
 Hey , just because you settled doesn 't mean I have to . Excuse me , I 'm sitting here .
 Hey , I did not settle for Leonard .
 I mean , obviously , he isn 't the kind of guy I usually go out with ...
 You know , physically . Again , I 'm right here .
 My point is , I do not judge a book by its cover .
 I am interested in the person underneath .
 I am here , right ?
 You see me .
 Hey , I 'm interested in what 's inside people , too , but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in , say , the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry ?
 Yes , you 're delicious caramel , too .
 All right , you know what , I will tell you why it 's wrong ... Excuse me , may I interject ?
 What ? Biologically speaking ,
 Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line .
 Thank you , Sheldon .
 Now , whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is , of course , an entirely different question .

 This is Ira Flatow and you 're listening
 Joining us today by phone ( helium hissing ) from his office in Pasadena , California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper .
 Oh , this is going to be a riot .
 FLATOW :
 Thanks for being with us today , Dr. Cooper . My pleasure , Ira .
 Now , let 's talk about magnetic monopoles .
 Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is ? Of course .
 First , consider an ordinary magnet which has , ( pitch raises ) : as even the most uneducated in your audience must know , two poles .
 ( clears throat ) ( pitch raises ) : A north and south pole .
 If you cut that in half , you have two smaller magnets , each with its own north and south pole . Uh , Dr. Cooper , I think there might be something wrong with our connection .
 ( higher pitch ) :
 No , I hear you fine .
 As I was saying , an ordinary magnet has two poles .
 The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole , hence , monopole . A requirement for string theory , or M- they , if you will , is the existence of such monopoles . SHELDON ( over radio ) :
 I , myself , led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles .
 Kripke , I found the nozzle ! I 'm going to kill you !

 So nice you could join me this evening .
 You 're looking lovely as always .
 Thanks , Howard .
 Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies .
 Come on , Katee
 Don 't make it sound so cheap . I 'm sorry , fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act .
 Thank you .
 So , shall we get started ?
 Sure .
 But can I ask you a question first ?
 Do you want to play Cylon and colonist ?
 No .
 I want to know why you 're playing make- believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight .
 You mean , Bernadette ? No , I mean Princess Leia .
 Of course I mean Bernadette .
 She 's a wonderful girl and she really likes you .
 I know , but she 's not you .
 I 'm not me .
 The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall , handsome , rich guy .
 Really ? Tall ? Six- four .
 Ouch .

 But come on , you got a wonderful girl in your life and you 're ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with mental image and a wash cloth .
 MRS. WOLOWlTZ :
 Howard !
 What are you doing in there ? I 'm taking a bath !
 I hope that 's all you 're doing .
 We share that tub !
 Don 't remind me !
 Oh , man .
 All soaped up and no place to go .

 ( knocking at door )
 How ya doin ' , buddy ?
 I was humiliated on national radio .
 How do you think I 'm doing ? Come on , it wasn 't that bad .
 ( sighs ) :
 What do you want ?
 We represent the Lollipop Guild , and we want you .

 Okay , so Kripke played a joke on you .
 It wasn 't funny . I thought it was funny .
 Raj . You laughed .

 Did you laugh ?

 I fell on the floor .
 All right , he got you .
 You can get him back . I refuse to sink to his level .
 You can 't sink . With all that helium in you you 're lucky you don 't ( high pitched ) : float away .


 Are you really admitting defeat ?
 I 'm never admitting defeat . Good .
 However , on an unrelated topic ,
 I am never getting out of this bed again .
 What if you could make Kripke
 look even sillier than he made you look ? I don 't think that 's possible , dude . You 're not helping .
 I didn 't come to help , I came to mock .
 Sheldon , what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke , like , uh
 like , how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane . That 's true . He didn 't just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains .
 He , he broke out and poisoned Gotham 's water supply .
 Well ...
 I suppose I could poison Kripke .
 No !
 No .
 It 's a simple matter .
 There are several toxic chemicals that 'd be untraceable in an autopsy .
 Okay , uh , that 's the spirit , but , um , let 's dial it back to a non- lethal form of vengeance .
 Oh !
 How about we whoopee cushion on his office chair ? He 'll sit down , it 'll sound like he 's flatulent , even though he 's not .
 Let 's keep thinking .

 Oh , gee , you 're too late .
 Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic , little weasels .
 I came to talk to Bernadette . She 's working today , right ?
 Yes , but I don 't think she wants to see you .
 Why not ? Come on , Howard .
 You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week .
 Plus , I 've kind of been talkin ' some smack about ya .
 Hello , Howard .
 Wait , Bernadette , I need to talk to you .
 I can 't now , I 'm working . This will only take a second .
 You asked me to think about where our relationship was going , and I did .
 Bernadette ?

 Will you marry me ?
 Is this more comedy that I don 't understand ?
 No . I 'm serious .
 I 'm never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is , you know , real .
 So , this isn 't a joke ?
 No .
 Then you 're insane .
 I prefer to think of myself as quirky .
 Howard , we 've only been on three dates .
 We haven 't even had sex yet . Fair enough .
 When 's your break ?
 Wow .
 Don 't you just hate when this happens ?
 Wow .
 All right , how 's this for revenge ?
 A solution of hydrogen peroxide , and one of saturated potassium iodide . What 's this ? Mountain Dew .

 Ahh , refreshing .
 Now , we 're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap ,
 ( all exclaiming )
 Foamy vengeance .
 Yes , exactly .
 This is brilliant , Sheldon .
 How are we going to deploy it in Kripke 's office ?
 Already taken care of . Observe .
 ( typing )
 This is a live shot of Kripke 's lab via a mini webcam I was able to install , thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor 's shirt pocket .
 At the same time ,
 I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling . Oh , Sheldon , you remind me of a young Lex Luthor .
 ( chuckles ) You flatter me , sir .
 - Yes .
 Motion sensors ?
 - Let me guess .
 The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room .
 Mwa , ha , ha .
 I gotta say , I am really impressed .
 This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even .
 ( whoopee cushion expels )
 It may be low- tech but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity . Here comes Kripke !
 LEONARD :
 Who is that with him ? KOOTHRAPPALl :
 I believe that 's the president of the university . And the board of directors .
 Abort ! Abort ! There is no " abort . "
 How could you not put in an " abort ? "
 I made a boo- boo , all right ?
 I think the board will really appreciate how well we 're using that NSA grant , President Seibert .
 KRlPKE :
 Right here we have a micro- controlled plasma ...

 Wow .
 Looks like the Ganges on laundry day .
 At least they don 't know it was you .
 ( chiming ) SHELDON ( on computer ) : Hello , Kripke .
 This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper .
 If you 'd like to see the look on your stupid face , this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube .
 Oh , and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter
 And Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise .
 Well , I 'm going back to India .
 What 's your plan ?

 Hey , he 's your tip from table seven .
 Oh , thanks Mm- hmm . WOLOWlTZ : Testing .
 Check . Check two .
 Oh , now what ?
 You want me to throw him out ? No , that 's okay .
 Are you sure ?
 He 's small .
 I bet I can get a nice , tight spiral on him .
 I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I 've done wrong .
 ( plays The Four Tops " Bernadette " ) * Bernadette
 * I am so sorry for
 * Trying to propose to you * Bernadette
 * You found it creepy
 * But that 's just the kind of thing I do * * Ahh ...
 * I know now it was too soon to talk of love * * It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub *
 * But , Bernadette , give me one more chance * ( falsetto ) :
 * Sweet Bernadette * I 'll get the hang of this thing *
 * They call romance , Sweet Bernadette , I dream to once again *
 * Kiss your lips , Sweet Bernadette * * Sincerely yours
 * Howard Wolowitz * Bernadette ...
 Oh , I am so sorry .
 Are you kidding ?
 That 's the most romantic thing anyone 's ever done for me .
 * Bernadette ! Thank you , Cheesecake Factory !
