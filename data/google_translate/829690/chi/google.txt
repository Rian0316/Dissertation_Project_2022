Recap
I have another child
But don 't you remember what you allowed yourself?
Not with the woman who carried our child
For some people love withers
do we know friends of wilson hard susan
Others are waiting for love to come and others are just born with new flowers of love . . .
but gone forever

Terrible thing happened at Lakeview Lane last year
Wonder why you gotta know Alma H odge when she woke up in the morning and she didn 't even think she 'd leave her husband on this day
Of course it was normal at first
She arranged the food as he asked
Hang up dry-cleaning clothes at his request
Fold the towel as he taught
It 's almost noon . . .
mom loves baby
Does baby love mom too?
mother !
Alma 's emotions exploded and she decided . . . it was time to fly away, of course she wasn 't stupid enough to tell her husband first
He thought Alma was happy and Orson H odge didn 't like being bullied
So she waited until her husband left and then... .

Baby you gotta hurry down, mom hurry up
quick !
quick !
If you don 't go back to the cage now
I have to leave you
I beg you
DAY 2 CAROLYNBIGSBY Comes to visit
like other gossipy neighbors
She knew she could find out more about ALMA without knocking on the door?
at home ?
C A R O L Y N ?
I 'm here to find Alma
I had an appointment with her for coffee this morning
she didn 't come
she left yesterday
gone ?
We had an argument
Harvey and I seem to hear your voices
I don 't know where she went, but don 't worry she 'll be fine
Orson no !
Orson no !
If Alma calls back I 'll tell her you found her
yes Orson H odge doesn 't like being bullied . . . whoever it is
6 months ago
It doesn 't rain often in F airview town but it 's a downpour every once in a while
On such a rainy day Breevandekamp and new boyfriend Orson H odge first date ended with a kiss in the rain
Gabrielle Soolis was seeing her new divorce lawyer add oil to her husband 's affair with the maid who happened to be pregnant with the couple 's child
at the same time. . .
Lynette Scavo is busy meeting the mother of her husband 's illegitimate child
Hey, grab it for me while suppressing the urge to strangle this 'mother'
Susan just found Mike seriously injured in a hit-and-run accident.
Comatose in hospital in Fairview
at the same time
E die Britt is putting up a 'for sale' sign on the lawn for my former house
Eddie also planned to clean the driveway to make the house more valuable but she is happy to find that the rain has helped her
That 's the benefit of rainy days
The rain washes everything clean and that 's what Wisteria Lane needs . . . because it 's going to get complicated here
today
welcome

Don 't worry about the water, the floor is synthetic
This is the introduction
Later, the police found her finger in the garbage oh no!
But they couldn 't find Felicia 's body
So I 'm not surprised at all when you open the cupboard to find out . . . hey!
Karen dear
Have you ever seen a marble toilet?
Oh, I must show you
Excuse me
what do you want
They asked why the last household mainly sold houses
I said Paul Young is in jail
they ask why
that 's how we talked
ok stop
I 've been trying to sell this damn house for months and you 're doing me a disservice

Those are for you old beggar who wants to buy a house
good luck finding a buyer
Maybe it 's easier to sell the Applewhite with the basement
go out
go out
Go out, go out, E die, do you have time?
There are some children, sit down, hurry up
Is Kayla ready?
thank you dear for doing this
I know it feels weird. I mean the Christmas family photo you posted has your husband 's illegitimate child in it but it 's important to her to feel like a part of the family
it does not matter
she 's a nice little girl
Okay, let 's start
I need to focus again
N O R A
L Y N E T T E
What are you sitting there for?
It 's a family portrait, isn 't it?
T om can i . . adjust your tie again
She sat down suddenly I don 't know what to say
How about this sentence 'You 're on camera, bitch get out of the way'
L Y N E T T E . . .
sorry
How long should I endure her?
Started just randomly dropping by
Then there are uninvited rubs three times a week
Now she wants to be photographed in the family portrait?
sorry impossible
Hey
don 't fight
It 's a holiday today
NORA . . . this is just a photo of our home
I prefer you don 't get involved
Okay
Kayla baby we gotta go
They 're going to drive us away
We didn 't say Kayla couldn 't.
is it good you know
If I can 't be in the picture she can 't either
It does not matter
I can not take pictures
All right
Okay
Of course you can pull
Keep that crazy woman on the side and we can cut her off afterwards
ok ok
hey it 's alright
It 's alright, let 's take a picture, kids
bring it on
thank you Lynette
Back to the Christmas mood I was looking forward to
10 seconds
I think it 's a bit silly
i have an interesting idea
Where are my cookies?
No biscuits, but I made some pickles
Pickles and soups ?
who wants to eat
You know that 's all I have
I won 't go to the store to buy it.
how are you doing
- i hate pickles - pick it up
The doctor said I can only get out of bed when I go to the toilet
Do you remember the baby well?
don 't go
I want you to rub my feet
- My feet are sore and the doctor said...
- Save it, Xiaomei!
The doctor didn 't tell you to rub your fucking fat feet
knead it yourself
you abuse me
Would you rather be with Mr. Solis in a dirty and smelly studio apartment with no TV and no air conditioning?
no me you won 't
You are the worst person I have ever seen
I am the worst
It 's been a year since you came to this country
Watch your grammar, damn it
really . . . slut
I can 't wait for you to have the baby soon
As long as you come out, I will send you to the plane back to Shanghai. You will face the loess in the rice field with your back to the sky until your hands and feet are peeled off.
But you promised to buy me an apartment in Chinatown so I could start a new life by working at my friend 's restaurant
Go tell your Chinese friends and sue me!
You know someone in the hospital does this but I like to do it myself
Mike will ask me to do it
what

What 's the result of his latest MRI?
sorry for not getting better
How long will it take to do it again?
I don 't want to tell you not to be too optimistic, but...
Listen I know it 's been 6 months but he still has a chance to wake up doesn 't he?
I saw a woman in Peru on the news
Still awake after 10 years
There 's a reason they 're reporting the news You may think I 'm naive but I 'm sure he 'll come back to me
- Susan . . - stop talking
you do what you do i do what i do
what
This gravy rice is amazing
Just like you
I hope you still have dessert
I got a very special dessert at a pastry shop in the city center
It 's cute but I really can 't take a bite
take me half
how about Bree
Will you marry me?
It 's a bit sudden, isn 't it?
We 've only known each other for 6 months but I love you every moment
- but if you don 't feel the same as me... - no no...
Me too
Just involuntarily a little cautious
My love has not been smooth since R ex
I used to be like that
Alma I broke down after leaving me but now I realize it was the happiest day of my life because it meant I was free when I met you
Bree where luck can change
let me change yours
i would
real ?
How does depression hurt?
I an H ainsworth has been in pain since his wife fell into a coma in a riding accident
For the next three years he avoided dealing with people, he wanted to lick his wounds alone
Until one day he met Susan Mayer who was as pitiful as he was because of her story
Friendship grows slowly because everyone knows that the same sickness takes care of each other
I an like this companionship this feeling is growing day by day
2. . . 3. Oh, it 's itchy, itchy, itchy. . . Does the nurse know you do this?



oh hey !
what you shouldn 't see
Yeah obviously if you drink coffee with me I won 't tell anyone
I 'd love to but I 'm in a hurry
I have lunch with my sisters at 1 o 'clock
Is it 1 o 'clock already?
You tell me I found you always running into the lobby to check the time so I . . .
I bought this for you

I I I can 't accept
too expensive
oh not expensive
There 's a guy on the street selling these.
Look closely and it says 'FOLEX' (a Rolex imitation) - I 'm still . . .
- please I 'll be happy if you accept
If that 's the case, thank you for the bargain
oh god
i 'm going to be late
New store opening soon

Hey !
sorry i 'm late
It does not matter
wow white gloves
Are we retro to 1880?
It 's a decent club
Orson has been a member for many years
They 'll look even better when they 're finished
You are mysterious on the phone
Why invite us to dinner
I 'd like to invite you to a dinner party prepared by Orson and I this Saturday
You invited us to dinner just for the next dinner date?
Really typical Bree style
For what? Oh nothing special
just hang out
why are you so secretive
I do not have it
You see this sentence is very vague
We won 't go if you don 't say
All right
I guess the wait time is officially announced but . . .
I 'm engaged to Orson
Oh, my god !
show me !
you are moving so fast
I know soon but it all feels right
Orson is the most gentle, wonderful and generous person
Oh generous
I mean he 's doing a good job in bed
Actually no, we haven 't had sex yet
We have to wait until we get married
oh god you mean it
There 's no ambiguity at all, not even at all. . .
no matter what you imply
But you 're getting married, so you don 't pay for a car without trying it out, right?
It 's not like you haven 't dated a man who isn 't married to you
Yeah, I used to be too indulgent with myself
It was wonderful that you brought this up when I announced my engagement
I think I learned from my mistakes though
Dinner starts at 8 when we announce
please act surprised
ok don 't worry
Then I 'll repeat the expression I found out that you 're not making out.
hey mommy so cute
Did you invite Kayla to Parker 's birthday party?
Of course
What else? What else?
How did you tell Nora?
I said we 'd pick Kayla to our house for a quiet afternoon
you lie? yeah you 're straight
I won 't let that daredevil ruin another 'house party'
But Kayla will tell her we 're having a party I 'm just afraid Nora will go crazy
how ?
So you are more afraid of Nora than me?
Do you think I mean that?
I definitely didn 't mean that
Baby you scared me
thanks
When the coffee machine broke, I bought a fruit scoop
they have strawberries and strawberries
I hate strawberries, give me strawberries
Hello JANE . The fruit scoop is good but I want to have dinner sometime
Maybe maybe we 'll go have a meal together?
You mean outside the hospital?
yeah like dating
Dating ?
There 's a nice little restaurant on this street
Feel sorry
I 'm really, really sorry
I mean hopefully
Yes !
I was just thinking about this idea how to date
I brought it up too suddenly
yeah a bit
Jane looks cold

thanks
We 're all in a difficult situation
I 've been around a bit longer than you so I can understand if you 're not ready
Let me know if you 're ready
i 'm really hungry
Then let 's go to the blood bank for some sweet cookies.
oh you might have to give Jane a bath just now.. a little accident happened
Hey
Hey LYNETTE it 's me
嘿 NORA
Are you having a party?
Be quiet and quiet!
No of course not anymore
In fact, we are resting quietly in the house
kids are so boring
Tom and I are thinking about taking them to ice cream
Oh can you tell KAYLA that her mother called
oh i will see you tonight
OK
goodbye
Do you think she believes it?
no i think she 'll be there in 10 minutes
Okay, let 's change places quickly
Who can leave me with the most and give him 10 bucks to understand?
Hey GABY I 'm LYNETTE
Can I borrow your backyard for an emergency?
Great
Great
I 'll take responsibility for the actions of these gangsters
Hope you get this message soon

My only concern is the neighbors
We do need a quiet environment for retirement
oh are you kidding
There is no place more peaceful than FAIRVIEW
run, run, run, run, run
Let me take you to the video room
go in so fast
Got the balloon?
OK
All right, all right now, everyone is in.

where is the cake ?
oh shit hi
anyone here ?
Hey
嘿 NORA
I thought you were coming at 7:00
Where is KAYLA? I think I said it
Tom took the kids to the movies
You said go for ice cream
Eat after watching the movie
What 's wrong with the American tradition of watching a movie before eating ice cream?
Honestly I think you 're lying you 're throwing a party
I think I guessed wrong
ok accept the apology
I 'll take you to the car
Where did everyone go?
NORA sorry I lied
But you don 't give me any choice - LYNETTE I want to meet my daughter
Where is this damn party?
No, I won 't tell you where the party is?

no !
If you want to go in get my permission
I want my child LYNETTE
KAYLA!
KAYLA come out to me now!
What happened ?
1st you threw a party 2nd you didn 't invite me to 3rd you lied to me so now we 're getting out of here
wait a minute
wait a minute KAYLA
I 'm very sorry
we 're sorry we shouldn 't
But KAYLA had a great time here
Why can 't we go in and have a snack together We can still LYNETTELYNETTE
we will be happy
I 'm sorry
L Y N E T T E
Well I know but what else can I do?
I 'm just thinking of Kayla I know you 're thinking of her and I know you love her
Otherwise, why do you think I put up with it for six months?
Why do you think I 'd like to talk to my college roommate
My husband 's illegitimate daughter and her mother are in our Christmas family photo
Because I am your wife!
I think of you beforehand
Will you think of me first?
goodbye NORA
This
i want to take KAYLA
That 's a shame, I 'm going back now to let everyone play the pinata
mom they have pinata
never mind
I 'll be back at 7:00
But you better leave me a piece of cake
Come on KAYLA let 's play
go play
Thank you
You are welcome
I 'll be back in 20 minutes
Going to buy a pinata ?
That 's right
Xiaomei ?
Come out for lunch, Xiaomei, your favorite TV has started
A doctor is flirting with a patient on the operating table
you can 't see
Xiaomei? I 'm going to give you another checkup
Still to do ?
Xiaomei ?

Hey, just ask, have you seen Xiaomei?

I can 't believe you lost our baby
I didn 't lose your baby you shut up I know where the baby is it 's in the belly of some crazy Chinese woman who stole half a chicken from my fridge


Hi
Hi
LIANG right?
remember me?
Xiaomei lives with me. You came and we had lunch together.
you 're good to find it
get out
Aren 't the Chinese people hospitable?
Xiaomei called me and she said you threatened to send her back to China as a slave

I
I may have mentioned it, but I didn 't expect her to take it seriously.
Are you crazy then it 's just a joke
I mean, shouldn 't people in this country have fun?
You 're so mean to Mei, she 's just a poor ignorant girl bent on living the American dream
like your ancestors
Hey, stop talking about 'the world is ours' crap
That woman has a stolen baby in her belly so if you know where she is better tell me or I 'll get in touch with the health department here
Let them find out how you make Mushu meat
These people have no sense of humor
I tell you this location sells well
I like the surroundings but I heard people have died here ?

It 's all bullshit
That 's made up by red-eyed people
Come check out the pantry
Unbelievable things to put down
Let 's go to the studio
You literally swallowed the ice cream whole
want something else
what do you say
O R S O N


I think we
O R S O N
I 'm thinking we 're engaged now
Will that change our values?
Not only when I see you standing in front of the refrigerator wearing tight silk clothes
At least shake my values
We all want our wedding night to be perfect
Yes, but if the actor wants the first scene to be flawless
It 's going to be better
Now
Do you still want some ice cream?
Don 't bring me that dress

Hi
I want to ask your opinion on something
IAN, you know, you 've seen him down the hallway
He wants me out anyway
date him
I know you are troubled
me too
But he 's really nice and I can find someone to talk to
and get a response

Actually I 'm a little lonely
The past 6 months have been too hard for me
so i need i need to know you won 't object to me going out with him
'Cause I 'm not going if you don 't want to
In fact, I just want you to open your eyes and tell me not to go out with him
wake up tell me
you wake up
I beg you !
All right

I 'll come back tomorrow
I love you

just have dinner
I put CARLOS down and pick you up
thank you EDIE


Mei is alright
The alarm goes off and all is well
How can you say that?
You almost killed our child today You dare to treat me like that You have no idea what I have endured for the past 6 months
Again
I 'm serving you little lover, imagine if you found out about JOHNROWLAND and me
You have to cook for him and rub his feet
Yeah but JOHNROWLAND isn 't pregnant with our baby
My concern for surrogate mothers is understandable
Mei will be alright
After the baby is born, she won 't have anything to do with her.
She 'll be able to go and live her American dream. What about me? I 'll be haunted by chores A single mom raising a child on her own

Discuss with a lawyer who should have children at Christmas
My American Dream is completely shattered
I 'm very sorry
Thank you but you know what my dream is not yet
Okay, we 'll see you on Saturday and be surprised
Goodbye you told others?
BREE threw this party to announce our engagement
I just can 't help it
I like to tell people what makes me feel
I have no idea
Makes me feel like I 'm starting over
It feels so good, I feel so good



cannot use hands


Oh you don 't need to wash that, I already washed it
I found some flaws
So I rubbed it with unmixed red wine vinegar
I 've never heard of that kind of thing
Yes
To remove stains like that, I use spoiled wine and water in a ratio of 1:1
For those stubborn stains I mean
like bathroom door
I would use a towel with diluted paint to paint
B R E E ?   O R S O N




I am sorry
what 's wrong with you
i want to first
Take care of you

but i don 't do that
why not ?
i 'm a republican i 'm a libertarian
I believe in minimizing state intervention and maximizing individual rights
but ORSON
Trust me
I know what I 'm doing
All right


Oh no !
What 's wrong? Is it the same as the first time?
I have to go ?
where to go ?
It 's like something inside is broken
not a rupture like a spasm
A wave of warm currents follow
I feel like I 've had a stroke
It 's weird how painful
I don 't feel pain at all
Actually, it doesn 't feel bad at all.
What were you doing at the time?
I am with my fiancé
lie down together
rest
Pardon me for taking a guess
Are you making love?
Roughly the same
Mrs VANDEKAMP I think it was an orgasm
no no no
I 've had an orgasm before, can you describe it?
It 's a warm feeling that release when it 's all over
- No more than that feeling this time- good
yes that 's an orgasm


oh damn


HI can I help you?
Are you BREEVANDEKAMP ?
it 's me you are ?
C A R O L Y N   B I G S B Y
I am ORSON 's neighbor
oh come in
Dry yourself off and drink something I 'm not here to celebrate

C A R O L Y N
Getting engaged again fast enough
Does she know you killed your wife? My wife left me

No one heard from her again
I don 't know her family nor do I know
just disappeared without a trace

ORSON what is she talking about?
Did he talk about that part? Yes? Well CAROLYN you can go
take your hands off
Don 't let him fool you
Let him leave you while you can still control it

please leave my house
Okay
marry him you fool
Don 't be surprised when you disappear too
I 'm sorry you had to put up with her
your wife
disappeared ?
I tried to find her and her family said they didn 't know her whereabouts
Personally, she just wanted to punish me
So you haven 't divorced yet?
Not because she 's gone I 've been granted a divorceBREE
- you can 't possibly think - no of course not

I love you
I love you too

ORSON my hand dinner begins


B R E E
With every storm comes hope that no matter what the morning comes, everything will be clean and even the most stubborn stains will be gone
like doubts about innocence wrong results
trauma of betrayal
kiss memory
We wait for the storm to recede and wait for the rain to pass
Even though we know that some stains in our hearts are so stubborn nothing can clear them
