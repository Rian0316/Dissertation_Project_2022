Emotional swings of course
it won 't
There is no relationship between you and me
one said goodbye
I 'm fed up with this life of failure
A nearly dead your wife won 't kill herself because of this note I wrote
She committed suicide because she had an affair with that kid
And of course one more . . . deserved
Gabrielle prepares for her next big project
When she was 15 she came up with her first great plan after her stepfather paid her to come to her room in the middle of the night
On the second day, I bought a ticket and went to New York
Her 2nd was 5 years later when she decided to seduce a famous fashion photographer
A week later she started her modeling career and it didn 't take long for her next plan to decide to marry Carlos S olis
She stopped modeling and moved to the suburbs
how her latest plan is to get out of her current life
So she started hanging out with the young gardener but it ended with an accident so Gabrielle had a new idea
Mrs S olis I know you are worried but it will take a while to recover
Um ?
What?
you look sad
I think you must be worried about your mother-in-law
Oh no
So what are you thinking?
my life
Live and I 'm the way I want to be
Oh dear
oh no i know i shouldn 't complain
I always feel less of something? But don 't know what it is?
Do you feel that way?
Well no
When I come home at night I slept like a child
Because I know I helped a lot of people today
that must feel good
uh yes
But sometimes I wish I didn 't get too tired from work
We 're short of nurses, but they 're still taking pay cuts
Attention All Attention Blue Alert 2 1 4 Room
I am sorry
Attention All Attention Blue Alert 2 1 4 Room
call the doctor, I don 't have an oxygen mask
I 'm running out of time I have to put the windpipe in
Mr. Getz Mr. Getz listen to me
don 't scare me, okay?
This tube helps you breathe
i need you to breathe
Here 's Gabrielle with another idea
She 's going to put on a charity fashion show to donate to nurses
G abby G abby I can 't do it
I can 't walk on stage in these dresses
I look too fat in them
Let someone else do it for me
- B etty listen to me - no no
Listen to me, Betty, okay?
you can 't quit now
we find you a new dress
it will make you look slim and beautiful
I need your courage
All right
Gabrielle slept soundly that night


The fashion show quickly spread across Wisteria Lane
Although it is a charitable event
Gabrielle soon discovers the latest fashion . . . women rarely donate
No one knows it better than E die B ritt
She knows these clothes are not out of date
S u s a n
give me this skirt
I 'm just looking around

Hey Helen
Hey
Does the skirt fit?
Yes, it 's a bit of a problem with the shoulders
Of course, no problem
almost done
You know what, G abrielle, I haven 't thanked you yet
Why?
thanks for what you did for my son
So glad you hired my son to be your gardener
trust me this is what i should do
How is he doing?
well
I heard he was dating Danielle Van D e K amp
Looking at it now, I think they will break up sooner or later.
what happened?
Oh she seems to have other plans
Do you remember dating the boys?
forgot
Thank you
You tell that Tanaka if he doesn 't call me in 1 hour . . .
I 'll go to his office to find him and give him a good beating
Ladies
Problems with work?
I don 't know what 's wrong with him
Anyway, he 's making money
I just want him to take a break
too bad too bad too bad
I tell you all the good clothes are bought
So what should I wear now?
Mrs. Huber hasn 't come yet
Why not try this one?
This is for the old lady
You can 't even see my body
E die this is perfect for you you always think of others
So why didn 't Mrs. Huber come?
I heard she went to see her sister
I can 't believe Martha decided to wear this dress
she always said she hated black
Mrs. Huber is miserable, it doesn 't get any worse than this
hey mom
Julie you can 't guess who wrote me
Z ach is strange that he will write to you?
Yes
hurry up
He probably said something about Dana
i 'm watching later
late? Why not now?
I have a lot of homework to do
What 's the matter with Julie?
This is not the first time I have received a letter from Zach
We 've been communicating for a while
Are you angry?
no
When I was your age my pen pal lived on a farm in O hio not a mental hospital
You know that kind of letter is scarier than a letter from a prison?
Z ach is not crazy
He 's just sad about her mother and his father doesn 't care much
He just needs a friend
i 'll change the diaper
I got juice and carrot sunscreen
understood
I 'll pick up the kids, we 'll meet at the park, that 'll give you a few hours
enjoy the holiday
What?
I 'll have to pay the bill to fold clothes and make dinner after you 're gone, so what 's a vacation?
ok you know what? Let 's go out to dinner you just have to take a hot bath and relax ok I get it


It 's not about taking a shower but don 't forget I 'm here all week
So what?
Can we go back to our normal life in the past?
To om our last normal life is to take birth control pills
Getting back to normal is a terrible plan
Okay, let 's work together to solve the problem
I think we 'll have to hire a full-value babysitter
That 's a big problem
I know we can 't afford it I guess it 's all my fault but if I don 't help
Here 's a good chance to ease me off
Okay, let 's get one
down 200m freestyle
something is wrong
What 's wrong?
The woman is still in a coma and he 's like nothing
We already punished him and we took his TV away
How do you want to punish him?
players prepare
I think I should let him quietly quit the swimming team
Bree, that 's what he likes
Maybe we take it away from him and he 'll wake up
He doesn 't blame himself for the accident
Of course he has
He 's just brave
yes he did very well
Listen if we let him out of the swimming team he probably won 't have an athletic scholarship and he won 't forgive us
I 'm willing to take the risk if that makes him a little human
I will not
That 's because you don 't love him as much as I do
Are you okay with that?
That 's the truth I 'm his mother
I gave birth to him
He just spent a few months in your womb in the 80s
Since then I love him just like you
what happened?
That kid you all love wins the game
J o h n
My mother said you need volunteers so here I am
Oh
Finally got some alms
you sound surprised
no no
you are the giver
Can you stop talking about that?
my mom is there
please sit
You can alphabetize these donation cards
Gossip you and Danielle are breaking up
maybe i don 't know
Is that because of me?
It 's not all your fault
can you not do this
Did you think of me
no
Yeah?
how dare you lie to me
hey want to help?
please get me a chair
oh my god
It 's alright, I 'll get it
Oh
hey
Can you get me those seat cards?
Of course you can tell me why you put your foot on John Rowland 's lap yesterday
oh that
Oh he 's helping me sew my pantyhose, of course it looks weird from your point of view
Did you sleep with him?
Yes
Yes but promise not to tell anyone about it
Gabrielle he 's still in high school it 's illegal to do that and you have a husband
If Carlos finds out Carlos will kill him
It 's okay to just have sex
How can you say it 's okay?
You know the final result of me and Karl
it 's none of your business
Of course about
I 'm in a relationship with other people who are abandoned by people they don 't love
You know what happened to me when Karl and Brandi ran off
I kept crying I wiped my tears with his clothes I couldn 't get out of bed all day
How could you do the same thing when you were there?
How can you compare me to Karl? that 's not fair
you don 't know my situation
Okay, so tell me what 's going on?
You are beautiful, have a lot of money and a husband who loves you
no he doesn 't love me
he likes to have me
That 's reasonable too. You get the idea.
see you at the show
come here baby
How many nannies have you interviewed?
10 each is worse than one
One also asked me . . . ok . . . if she wanted a diaper change
It 's so hard to find a good babysitter
so i want to hear your advice
Oh god what do you want me to do?
Your rich friends have a huge list of babysitters
I need one . . . get it . . . without going through their boss
Why?
So I can ask her
L y n e t t e
Listen, my old company never waited for customers to come.
We go out and grab customers from other companies
I don 't see how this is any different from having a babysitter
I understand that a good babysitter is hard to find, but robbing someone 's babysitter doesn 't look decent
I 'm not threatening people
If I give more money, will no one come?
Confidence
where can i find nanny for senior point
Hey Mrs Solis
I have some terrible news
I have some less scary news too, so let 's get started
I broke up with Danielle
wrote her a note in French class
so we can be together
John looks like you 're out of luck
What do you mean?
Susan Mayer saw us last night and she knew everything
Since that incident, Bree has been worried that his son 's moral sense will become less and less.
She 's starting to pay attention now
A n d r e w ？
May I come in?
yes wait
Hey
What 's wrong?
why are you laughing?
That 's just . . . I just heard a joke
Oh about what?
Forget it, it 's an adult joke mom
very good
I 'm thinking maybe you should take a little more time to reflect on it . . . you 've brought pain to the Solis family for all you 've done
Of course I realized early on the impact of everything I did
really?
Yep
I mean you know I act like a kid sometimes you know you can act like a kid sometimes I mean you know it 's inevitable
Because uh . . . everything has a balance
everything will be ok you know no i don 't understand
What does that taste like?
Are you smoking marijuana?
of course not
you are addicted
no no no no mom
excuse me
what is that
you pee in this container
ah that hurts
What are you doing here, Dr. Sicher?
Mr Young I . . .
I don 't want to say these things that upset you on the phone
what is that?
Zach ran from Silvercrest
happened last night
We think it might have happened during a shift change
I know it 's hard to accept
very sorry
Well I 'm used to it
I still don 't understand why you broke up with Danielle
She was so sexy at Ray 's prom
I think she might not be my type
No, you 're still with that mysterious married woman
What 's so good about her?
Except for her figure of course
Let 's be honest, you know?
She doesn 't treat me like she treats a sucker
But you 're a stinky child
It 's a mess now
Her friend found out about our affair
If it gets out, his husband will kill me
Hey, the good side is that your popularity at school has increased a lot.
Shut up when they know you 're hanging out with a sexy housewife dude
Please explain to me how he can run away?
Since I paid you, you should be optimistic about him
But we 're not a security company, you just gave us the right to treat Z ach
What do you mean by that?
You insisted that we not give him psychotherapy
This would have been a good treatment
Zach is a very unstable young man and he may become even worse
Are you hungry?
I 'm starving
Bree told Lynette to go to Valley View Park
There is a place where senior nannies and children gather
Lynette went there for the first time and she didn 't want to go home alone
Of course Lynette is very demanding and making eye contact is not easy
She is desperate to find a special babysitter
That 's who she 's looking for
Please wash your hands
Okay, this is for you, this is for A my
So have fun, just come to me if you need anything, okay?
Was there anyone from the moment she saw her?
sit without you
Lynette knew it was her
You know what I 'm so amazed that you get along so well with these kids
thanks
I am Lynette
C l a i r e
C l a i r e ？
I 've always liked that name
So Claire, do you come here often?
what is this?
your son 's urine
wait i will
I think A ndrew has been smoking marijuana so I want you to grab this and test it right away
Why?
I want you not to put him on the swim team I don 't think you would do that without proof
You can 't get him back from the swim team with or without proof
I will
If you 're going to do that, I 'll tell the coach to ignore you
We can 't ruin A ndrew 's future because he 's out of line
I mean didn 't we agree?
did not solve
R ex I thought you 'd go home and educate A ndrew about the consequences of what he did
I don 't understand why you keep pestering me about this
'Cause I don 't agree  'Cause we 're not divorced I 'm not letting you hold my nose
I never forced you
We always make decisions together
No, you always make good decisions and let me agree
For 18 years I 've put up with what a lie I 've told
Thank goodness to finally get rid of you
R e x
what are you doing
do what i always do
do you know?
If you were my mom, I 'd smoke marijuana too
So your customer asked you to return her underwear?
Yes, she ended up wearing it once
Didn 't you say no?
You can 't say no to Alexis if you want to keep your job
she sounds scary
What can I do? i love these kids
If we have a nanny like you in our family, it 's too late to be happy
Did I mention I have 4 lovely kids?
really?
oh yes
oh no
What?
is Alexis
I don 't want her to misunderstand so you better go
Are you still here tomorrow? i want to see you again
no i 'm busy
i just wanna talk
Lynette this doesn 't work
Claire Claire please
good
I 'll stay there until noon tomorrow
gone
OK
hey kid?
What are you doing here?
I know you understand you may be freaking out I want to explain to you
So olis and I . . . love deeply
do you know? We have a better future than just sex
listen to me
You and Gabrielle will never end
She won 't divorce Carlos and run away with you
Why not?
Because he is rich and a lot
Listen I 'm not going to mow the lawn for the rest of my life
- I have big plans - ah that 's good
listen, stop talking
John how old are you?
It 's almost 18
That 's right
You 're too young to have a relationship like this for you to be realistic
You are happy with girls your age
she is what i want
you know i love her so much
Let 's welcome Mrs A rlene Nord
Arlene and her husband Norris have provided the folding stool tonight so remember to buy the folding chair to find Nord
Next is Mrs Betty Nolan

Thank goodness Tom is finally here
Why is Carlos absent?
There 's something he doesn 't want to talk about at work
Sometimes I really want to kill him
Look away Tom is enjoying his life
Hands down guys she 's mine
I guess he has some kind of magic
Oh Bree you 're the first Lynette to keep up

Can I go without underwear?
Yes

Yeah? I look alright, right?
Oh Susan you are so beautiful
Is it E die?
Oh, I said it in the past
G abrielle, you should change the order of appearances
Susan should be the last no one is more suitable than her
Oh no Helen R owland is the last one?
Yeah, she didn 't even need someone to do it for her
yeah that 's a good idea
ok let 's go

Susan I 'm so sorry
Susan tell me something
Okay what do you want me to say?
You go to Helen Rowland and tell her the truth before the neighbors think I 'm having an affair with that underage guy
i can 't do that
Why not?
She 'll call Carlos and he 'll divorce me
so what? you don 't love him
i love him
it 's a bit complicated
do you know?
There must be other ways to solve this
God you are so weak
Susan don 't do this
what do you want? a hug
Hey
Yep
I come
A lexis is still here
Oh
She was going to pilates but she had her period
you go away
just a while
No, she saw you in the park, okay?
She knows what you 're up to, you 're not the first person to approach me
C l a i r e ！
She treats you like this, why are you still here?
She 's qualified to be tough but it 's her turf right?
I won 't treat you like that
Claire where did you put your aspirin?
I 'll give you 20% more salary including overtime
Where the hell did you go, Claire?
I don 't listen to your friend
I 'm not a phone waiter I don 't do laundry
Cooking?
only for children
How quickly can you pack your bags?
i found a nanny
Where are you going?
I don 't know but can 't go home
Are you afraid of your father?
not because of him
Mainly me my life is a mess
Very bad
How bad is it? Can you tell me?
No, I can not
you better not know
I already know some
Hey Danielle how is school?
very good
Where did Andrew hide the marijuana?
Bree takes the most extreme measures to save her son 's soul
When she searched A ndrew 's belongings she discovered that sometimes a little punishment was good for his soul
I was very young, about 4 years old
I heard my parents fight
I heard them mention my name and hers
D a n a ？
Yep
so. . .
I went into that room and I saw they were scrubbing
Scrub what?
Blood traces
Dana 's?
I think it is
I forgot about it until . . . I started having these dreams when my mom committed suicide
I can 't see Dana
I just saw the blood and my mom picked me up and put me on the bed and whispered to me that it wasn 't my fault
But ever since I mentioned her name they got really pissed
I 'm not allowed to say her name again
I don 't quite understand what you 're saying
I killed my baby sister
Z ach oh my god
Then they buried her to protect me
Helen, do you have time?
Oh G abrielle
I didn 't get a chance to tell you what happened to that charity gala
I don 't want to do that
Fortunately, people didn 't notice
yes it 's a little embarrassing
I know you and Susan Mayer are friends but I have my reasons
That 's not Susan
that 's me
What?
I 'm the one who had an affair with your son
I am sorry
How long?
about 1 year
But it 's over now
He was only 16 when it started
I think
But Helen please believe me it 's over
no you are wrong
it 's not over
hey coach wants to see you
really?
hey i bet it 's about my scholarship
Hello?
it 's me
Found marijuana in his locker? oh i 'm so surprised
This can be a very scary mistake
ok i 'll go now
Elsewhere another secret is being investigated
Mr. Linder
Mr. Linder
Yep?
Agent B eckerman this is Agent B urnett
We would like to chat with you for a few minutes
If you know Zach 's whereabouts, it 's your responsibility to tell us
Well . . . what 's the matter darling?
Zach ran from Silvercrest
They found letters in his room
written by julie
yes they keep communicating
i need those letters
Mom, that 's a personal item
my son is missing
In those letters, did Julie say anything about running away?
no
this is your answer
Susan I 'll let you know right away if we hear anything
I understand you are worried
Obviously you don 't understand
Paul my daughter won 't lie
It was very popular at the time
I have probably sold over 100 in the past 10 years
Do you have any records?
yes i have a customer list
That was a long time ago
we need a copy
Oh of course
Ah, how did this box become like this?
Yeah we just found it in Rockwater lake
you should think about it
What 's in the box?
There is a corpse female corpse
Yes but how can you fit a corpse in such a big box?
she was dismembered
all this stupid decision
What were you thinking at the time?
I got fired, okay?
Someone called the coach anonymously
A ndrew what 's the matter? where you put the marijuana
I put it for a friend
do you know. . .
I don 't know which humiliated me the fact that my son was caught for possession of drugs or that he didn 't have a sound reason to explain it all
Gabrielle believes it would have been a good opportunity
Helen Rowland will tell Carlos the whole thing
Gabrielle knew she had to clear it up
C a r l o s ？
What?
But to clarify . . .
I uh . . . Gabrielle is not good at that
i went to bed
thanks for letting me know
she betrayed me
C a r l o s ！
Carlos very sorry very sorry
Why apologize?
I love you so much no matter what happens
FBI opens the door
Oh my god
FBI if you don 't open the door
I have the right to use force
Carlos S olis I have an arrest warrant you are under arrest
you have the right to remain silent
Yep?
What you say will be presented as evidence in court
call our lawyer
You have the right to a lawyer . . .
- Attorney can be present at the trial - what happened to Carlos
If you can 't afford a lawyer, we 'll give you one for free
Carlos wait!
Gabrielle I promise it 'll be alright
I swear to god I 'm innocent
Tanaka framed me
man is a complex animal
On the one hand good at alms
On the other hand . . . is bad for the betrayal of others
Anger in each of us is a constant battle between the good side of our nature and the dark side of our hearts
Sometimes the only way out of darkness
just have a little sympathy
They took him away in handcuffs
