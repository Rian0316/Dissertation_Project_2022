Recap
Gabrielle is taking revenge . . .
Did I hurt you, or do I need to do more?
Tom has an idea . . .
I 'm opening a pizzeria!
Bree got a warning . . .
He 's a cold blooded killer
The police got a clue . . .
those blue markers i think are phone numbers
here is mikedelfino
this shouldn 't have happened
The war for mike is raging
How can you sleep at night?
Soon mike will be sleeping on me
There is a saying that repentance is the salvation of the soul
This sentence is all too familiar to some blond who used to confess her sins to Father O 'Malley once a week
to the dismay of priest o ' malley as time passed, a theme emerged
I seduced the cable guy again
i made a folk singer
I slept with a rabbilippman last week
every time she is forgiven
o  ' malley priest told ediebritt to be serious and stop making mistakes
Unfortunately for edie the temptation looks... .
OK
everywhere
E die What was our relationship like before the car accident?
What do you want to say?
Um, are we getting close?
seriously?
We live only 50 feet apart and you barely feel me
Really?
absolutely true
I mean you 're not rude or anything
We waved or said 'hello' when we went out to get letters but you never looked me in the eye
never
I 'm just one of your neighbors
If we are not friends why do you come to help me every day?
Because from the first time I saw you . . .
i fell in love with you
I 'm telling you this doesn 't ask for anything. You can relax as much as you can, okay?
OK
But when you get home if we . . . get the trust, we 'll meet again
I would appreciate it if you . . . could look me in the eye
That 's fine
i 'm looking at you now
Yes there is a saying that repentance is the salvation of the soul
Mike Delfino made out with me today and it was awesome!
But some confessions are tight bragging in disguise


Breehodge hates sudden . . . knocks on the door
She 's always pretty sure there 's nothing good about this knock
Either a cosmetic salesman or a religious fanatic or a big family
But the surprise that Bree waited for this day was not as unpleasant as she imagined
hello bree
C a r o l y n
it 's not a good time
i 'm baking
B r e e ?
Oh, Hello
we haven 't met yet i 'm harveybigsby i brought my wife to apologize to you
the bell rang
Things are almost ready
oh please hmmm . . .
She 's been under a lot of pressure since alma disappeared and she 's not herself
She also took Mexican painkillers she bought online but I stopped her
oh orson tell me you two are very close out of respect for the friendship I 'm all ears
After reconsidering I realized that maybe I did it out of line
My horrific accusation is really out of line
I deeply apologize for the pain I have caused
I hope you can forgive me from the bottom of my heart
Oh I appreciate how hard it is for you
accept the apology
Really relieved
Me too
Oh you don 't know how smooth I 'd be playing golf if it didn 't bother me
Oh maybe we can have lunch together at the club sometime
sounds really good
Great
Darling you are amazing you know what?
So noble to leave all unpleasantness behind
oh thanks dear
But if for a second you 're thinking I 'm going to eat with that vicious drug-addicting bitch and you 're going crazy
Hey susan! what are you doing?
I just dropped the shovel thanks
good day now
goodbye
s u s a n ?
I a n !
What a surprise!
Are you uh, are you hiding from me?
hmm a bit
I. . .
The last time we saw each other was awkward and complicated
that 's a thing of the past
Plus it 's definitely business
I threw a party for an editor friend from London I thought you two should meet
You can bring a male companion if you want
Speaking of which, how is mike now?
oh well some progress
This is a course of treatment
Well that blond woman comes to see him every day is she part of the treatment too?
um edie ? oh she is . . .
just a neighbor
She came to see mike after her hepatitis C treatment was over
Oh I really wish you could come to this party so you can meet my editor friends
I just I just don 't think it 's a good idea
right
Oh at least I uh I can see you
You have. . .
It 's a funny Peter Maier wardrobe
My understanding is that your client doesn 't like antiques at all
No relationship
It 's a valuable asset
All right
Let 's discuss the Costa Poda vase
No this is premarital income
We have a receipt as proof
This is a gift for Mr. Solis
You probably didn 't do a good job in law school that day, myron. This is called marital property.
don 't bother you kenny
We 're going to fix this
Enough is enough. Give her everything she wants.
Look, I 'm tired of fighting
uh i need to talk to my client alone
It 's been going on for a few months.
I 'll sign whatever documents are prepared.
you give me all I want? that 's it?
that 's it
We 'd like to see the paperwork when this thing is over
This is awesome!
we beat them
Mrs. Solis, they took all the bills
Blame it on the fact that Carlos won 't take all the bills
That bastard must be calculating something
Blindfolded before you come in
- Tom I . . .
- do as I say
ok now . . .
When I say 'open' don 't look with your eyes
use your imagination
All right
ok open
oh dear god
Damn you looked with your eyes!
This is a junkyard!
What are you thinking?
Oh I agree with you that this place needs renovations
This is a ruin
come on baby come with me
We can put a nice tablecloth here and put a jukebox on this big screen to watch sports
How can you not see the potential of this place?
oh i just didn 't find it
T om do you know what I think about this pizzeria
Oh hope you are interested in this
do not. . .
tell me you haven 't signed the lease
It 's hot here!
T o m !
Do not
A lot of people have taken a fancy to here, I must act fast
You signed the contract but didn 't discuss it with me?
Oh maybe I didn 't tell you because I knew you 'd try to convince me to pass up the best chance of my life
OK
OK, let 's do this
You said a lot of people are looking at this place so we can sublet
Now let 's get out of this hell
You said you would support my dreams
I made a mistake I assumed you should have a dream worth supporting
I 'm staying here tonight
All right
Two glasses of lemonade for the winner
You keep hitting bree like this and we 'll be pretty sure in the end
hello tish
hello rebecca
Did you see it? ignore me on purpose
Maybe she didn 't recognize you
R ebecca I just talked to her
You can call me paranoid but amygriswold did the same thing to me in golf lessons last week
What happened?
You really don 't know?
Do not! I don 't know what?
T ish is a good friend of carolynbigsby
Carolyn know tish ?
she knows everyone
anyway tish didn 't want to talk to you because you married orson after carolyn told you he killed his wife
It 's ridiculous that Orson didn 't kill Alma
Also, carolyn apologized to me yesterday for this incident.
Oh maybe Tish doesn 't know yet
Oh you don 't believe these nonsense, do you?
Right?
Bree you are the best tag team I have ever met
Can we discuss this after the league is over?
Hello
I would like to reserve a table for tonight please write the names of hodge and bigsby we need a table in the middle
How long will Dad be away?
oh that depends on your dad
Did you two quarrel?
right
A little bit
but it does not matter
it 's okay we still love each other
But just like a child, sometimes it takes time for adults to lose their temper
Why can 't he slow down in this room?
Because he decided to slow down at his pizzeria
unfair
that sounds fun
Not this pizzeria that 's a rat hole
But as soon as your dad 's senses come back and stop being mad he 'll come home
What is make-believe?
It 's childish stubbornness and carelessness about my money and your future
Ah?
It 's an adult word when dad comes home
You 'll learn a new word -- humiliation
They had a big fight
Dad is sleeping in the restaurant
no no it 's good you told my dear little pea
Would you like to open your little ears wide?
good bye mom
goodbye
Oh hey that 's for me I 'll get it
All right
oh i 'm defeated
i want to take a nap
uh wait a minute
you sweat a lot
how? I just finished exercising
You don 't want to lie anywhere in this house without a shower
fair and reasonable
It 's all yours, right?
i don 't know myron
Just a bunch of laws
Take a good look and call me
Oops!
What?
Why did you put your shorts back on again?
Why would you care?
Well, they 're so dirty I want to wash them for you
Do you want to wash my shorts?
I don 't want to but if you wear them again they will ask me to wash themselves
Wait a moment
I forgot something in my pocket
Do not bleach
understood
So it 's just a work contract?
To welch and simon gave him $2 million plus stock options over 3 years
Oh this is wonderful!
I have half right?
Oh no
If he signs the contract and you legally divorce him, you won 't get a penny
This sinister cunning bastard!
Thank goodness I sneaked over his desk
At least we now know why he wants to get your side ASAP
Okay, let 's talk about what happens when you postpone the divorce
I 'll still get my share of the $2 million right?
Oh theoretically yes but . . .
What do you want to do with it?
I know what carlos is thinking more importantly what he wants to do
Is that susanmayer?
Yes, what 's wrong?
Mr Delfino wishes not to be disturbed
Mike? It 's me
Are you nice?
hey susan
Hey, You
what are you doing?
i beg mccluskey to watch my kids for a while i can rest a while and meet my old friend . . .
Margarita
Do you want to join us? trust me i really want to but well i have to . . .
i have to cook for julie
All right
Oh you know what to do with it
She 's 16 years old and if she can 't support herself by now I 'm a failure
so cool
Where are we talking?
How can you kill edie without knowing it?
Oh, right
oh i hope paulyoung is still there he will know what to do
Well gaby! Just don 't say 'hello'!

Hey!
cocktail? Nobody called me?
It 's just a whim We 're losing consciousness of our miserable lives
Oh I 'm trying to drive away the grief with exercise but why risk a heart attack?
Get me a double!
i don 't recognize her
Who is she?
This is exactly what we were trying to find
your phone number is in her hand
I 'm sorry I can 't help you
He has amnesia
Things after 2004 . . .
very vague
No memory?
That 's so convenient
oh thank you for your time mr Delfino
You killed a policeman, didn 't you?
that 's self defense
Hope it wasn 't just the luck of the first offender
you want to sue me try
or get out of my room
Are you always so angry, Mr. Delfino, or you don 't remember?
Do you sell small pieces here? Or do I have to buy a whole pizza?
What are you doing here?
I know how hard you work so I wanted to bring you something to eat . . .
and drink
You know what I can 't judge this red wine is it 's either too expensive or I drink too much
I can 't believe lynette doesn 't love this place
If you ask me she 's a negative woman
She 's just too realistic
I mean this restaurant business is cruel
tom listen to me ok because i 'm an intuitive person i have a strong premonition that you 'll make it

do not do that
I was serious
I believe you
T o m   S c a v o
Thank you
wait what happened
we kissed
not you kiss me
no you want me to do it
no no i don 't want to
really?
Look this is you my wife doesn 't understand me
Hey let 's have a few more drinks alone in this abandoned house
I just want to vent
Ok but when the opportunity comes uninvited . . .
Nora don 't do this!
I love my wife !
Yes ?
You mean the one who thinks you 're a loser?
The one who doesn 't love me very much and doesn 't want me to screw things up
I think it 's time to get back to her
you tricked me
you shouldn 't do that
I was just about to say that tequila makes me happy
Yeah what 's wrong with us drinking on the porch?
oh i know them they live in cyprus
Just celebrated their 53rd wedding anniversary
show off
Don 't worry it won 't last
You are just kidding yourself!
hey i know them oh 5 3 years
What do you think is their secret?
I 'll take a wild guess at the man who never opened a pizzeria
oh what did i just think of
I will never have a 5 3rd wedding anniversary
I 'll be alone until I 'm 90
God I 'll be alone forever
bite this
Can I tell you something . . . something that can only be told to you ?
God, she 's here again. What grade is he in?
That 's not what I 'm talking about
What I 'm saying is that even though he cheated on me and cheated on me, I still love Carlos
Of course he 's so sexy
What if I no longer have that passion with others anyway?
Maybe you should try to make up your relationship with him
no i 've got a lawyer i 'm gonna beat him
I asked myself to tell Tom I want you to be your true self
But the truth is I don 't want to
I think he has what he wants if that 's what I want
i 'm a bitch that starts with C
No! No you are not!
You are a good wife and mother
Although . . . don 't you have kids?
Me and Mike used to be so passionate
like a play
Very dramatic sex shouldn 't be so difficult
Oh baby!
But you know it 's easy with I an
You know, that 's the kind of man I 'll spend the rest of my life with
Then go to I an! Tell him you made a bad decision and he is the one you want to be with
What do you have to lose?
Excuse me ladies ?
Look at Susan God called you a taxi

Actually I . . . I have something to say to you
Okay Doug see if you can help me find Judith

Thanks since you 're here I 'd like to introduce you to the editor I 'm talking about
Oh I don 't think that 's a smart move because I 'm really out of shape
Feeling hot?

S u s a n !
Oh is this the Susan you keep talking about?
yes it is she
Can you leave us alone for a while?
Oh of course
What 's up ?

But first I think I have to go to the bathroom
Oh . . . of course over there
She looks good I an .
yeah she is absolutely the best
Oh I 'm sorry to make you see me making a fool of myself
Looks like you 've seen Judith
I pressed 100 pieces on it, and the pressure was right here with me.
I reach into my bag and pull out my 4 and bang . . . hole in one
He has no pocket money since then.
Didn 't I tell you how happy these two got along?
Oh they are . . . T ish !
hello Bree
C a r o l y n
Do you know each other
I don 't even need an introduction T ish you know what I 'm wondering if you need some help for Christmas
Last year I was on the decor committee . . .
Oh my god I forgot to call you so stupid!
Let 's start tomorrow

Very happy to see you
Me too
Do I have to touch up my makeup?
oh glad
So glad we went out to eat together
Yes, I too had a really good night
really interesting
Could you give us some more tissues? Thanks
You know what I suddenly realized one day
You 've never seen a photo of Alma, have you?
Haven 't seen what happened?
I have to say it 's not her best look
what are these ?
That 's the police report that Alma filed after Orsan abused her
It 's all there . . . bruises hurt wrists
This is impossible
Photos don 't lie Bree
Is that why you apologize?
Yeah I want you to spend more time with me so you 'll know I 'm not the kind of crazy woman who disturbs your life
I 'm sorry but if something like that happens again I 'll never forgive myself

thanks
I have a hunch you 'll need these

Continued Cup
Hey guy
You have to take it easy, huh?

H arvey ? listen I 'm going through something
But there is no one to talk to
i have an affair
Ah, Carolyn, do you know?
No she was kept in the dark I met this girl on a flight from Paris We . . . have great feelings for each other
I know it sounds crazy but . . .
love at first sight
Are you still dating her ?
No that 's the problem she stopped calling me a few months ago I went to her place I looked for her and she just disappeared
I . . I want to say I know how cruel it feels to you to lose Alma
it will be alright trust me
I just can 't forget me . . .
I can 't forget Monique
M o n i q u e ?
her name
M o n i q u e . . .
P o l i e r
Is she beautiful?
she . . . is very beautiful
you are back
You two have been gone for a while, is everything okay?
Of course
Who needs dessert ?
What are you busy with?
Had a quiet night with friends
Listening to what happened tonight I thought . . .
You mean more to me than any restaurant
Oh stop saying it 's me who should apologize I 'm an incompetent wife
No no no no no! You 're just trying to stop me from being reckless
Any wife will support a husband who never takes risks I don 't want a husband like that nor a wife like that
You go open a pizza shop and we 'll figure out how to make it work
You don 't know what it means to me to hear what you say
god i love you
So what happened tonight?
ok but wait till i finish you react
And remember it 's actually a good thing because that 's how our hearts are together again

Ding-dong
I don 't know what Tom told you but he took the initiative
I 'm sorry I didn 't hear clearly
Why don 't you come and tell me again?
leave me alone
I 've been trying to stay away from you
mother ?
Everything is fine, you can go back to your house and play
kayla ! don 't move

Well Well
I 'm leaving
First I want to hug your mother
This is where the grudge between you and my family ends.
When Kayla comes you drop her at the end of the street
you won 't see my husband again if you dare try
Your spine will end like your door
Nod when you understand
And you and we meet on Saturday, right?
don 't forget to bring your swimsuit
Good morning! You look in good spirits . . .

frizz (hair)
Did you spend the night here?
I slept on the couch and when I took you home you were still . . . tossing tacos in your American parlance ( spit )
Better to eat as little as possible
thanks
What else happened?
do not you remember ?
ok i 'll tell you . . . i 'll repeat what you said last night
Then you tell me is it the truth or are you ready to talk?
Are you saying that you miss me, the truth or the wine?
Honestly you said breaking up with me was a mistake and you want to start over
Truth or booze?
Tell me the truth, you 'll tease me by wearing my school uniform
Truth or booze?
Oh I never said that
ok thats but if you said . . .
Truth or booze?
Both are a bit so . . . true and false

R idley detective morgue that woman 's corpse is called Monique Polier

Are you? She had an affair with a man named Harvey Bigsby before she died.


understand ?
yes can i know your name ?
I need you to come and take a note
Can Carlos come over and help me?
i 'm watching the game
I 'll beg you in just a moment?

Why Gaby?
You look good
oh thanks i 'm going to dinner with some new friends
But my drawing is stuck. Can you help me?
ah really stuck
like it 's glued

strangeness
You know what? I don 't want to be late. Looks like I have to change.
Oh carlos these old things ?
you 've seen it before
I 'm going to wear that blue one
Can you pass the stockings over?

Oh my nails will scratch the stockings
you gotta help me put it on
Are you sure ?
I can do it myself but I don 't want to wear ripped socks
It hasn 't been like this for a long time
Is it? I feel like it was yesterday
Need my help hooking them up?
Of course
why not ?
For the sake of the past
What about your new friends?
I decided to catch up with old friends first.
Mr. Bigsby, Detective Riley in charge of murders
I think you know her
yes we slept

Can we talk somewhere else?
Of course

Carlos Do you think we are making a mistake?
What 's the meaning ?
the whole divorce
Maybe we shouldn 't
like we can 't find this passion in other people

You mean you want us to be together ?

yes i think so
Why not forget the past and be together? What do you think?
oh baby . . .
If you knew how long I waited for you to say that word . . .


What 's wrong? What 's so funny?
Oh
I thought I 'd get through it like nothing happened but you 're so funny

Little thing I have to confess to you the only reason I know you slept with me is because I got a job

Did you find a new job? That 's great darling!
Gaby you are a model not an actor .
There 's no such thing as a job
The contract on my desk is fake and I sent it to myself
what ?
Why are you doing that?
Let 's put it this way . . .
You did this just to trick me into going to bed?
No, I 'm doing this because I know you 'll change your mind when you smell money
Then I can leave you behind and live my own life
Your own? You don 't have to play me around and take my money and walk away like nothing
I want you to be hurt baby look at your face when the imaginary $2 million is gone
I did it
you bastard
Better a bastard than a whore

Oh my God

Hello? There was an accident with my husband . . . he . . .

I 'll call you again

C a r l o s ?
Dear ?

C a r l o s ?

Oh
bring it on
S t. Timothy Church has a place for sinners to repent
They expect forgiveness when they confess, but not all confessions are worthy of forgiveness
Most people 's secret plan exposed and deserved condemnation
Most revenge motives exposed to get the punishment that comes with it
Only truly repentant will have the right to a second chance

Come on, what 's my surprise?
I thought you wouldn 't come here
That 's why it 's best to think twice before you repent . . .
M i k e ?
What 's up ?
That . . . that dead girl . . .
especially if you don 't know what you 're confessing
i think i know her
