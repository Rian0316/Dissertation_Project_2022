‎ - I 'm Erin, I 'm an addict‎ - Hi, Erin
‎ I 've been off drugs for 1 3 months
‎ Everyday is hard
‎ This is my daughter Maeve, who is here today
‎ she was angry with me‎ but I understand her anger‎ I want her to know she can totally blame me
‎ Because I 've caused her so much pain
‎ But I also hope she understands ‎ My life is also very difficult
‎ I 've been in trouble many times in my life, but I 'm just trying my best with the only resources I have
‎ Maeve
‎ I will never forgive myself for abandoning you and your brother
‎ I just hope‎ you can find a way to forgive me
‎ You are too exaggerated
‎ - What 's wrong? ‎ - You are the one talking, Erin
‎ That 's not called an apology, it 's just another excuse

‎ You are not in trouble‎ You made bad decisions by yourself
‎ Hey wrestler, why are you here?
‎ oops
‎ - Can you help me? ‎ - Why am I helping you? annoying
‎ oh, that 's funny
‎ You don 't like to laugh very much, do you?
‎ Always keep a straight face, is this your selling point?
‎ - What does this do? ‎ - Come in if you want to know
‎ I 'm not interested
‎ But you really want to know
‎ I don 't want to

‎ oops
‎ It seems that you should help me get it in.

‎ My brother and I come to teach once a week
‎ - Where did you learn to dance? ‎ - just learn everywhere
‎ I had an accident when I was in the military‎ When I went to Afghanistan for the second time
‎ The tank I was sitting in was attacked by a pack of wild dogs
‎ - I 'm lucky to survive‎ - I didn 't ask
‎ But you really want to know
‎ I don 't feel sorry for you at all
‎ - I need a partner‎ - perfect
‎ Jerry, this is Maeve
‎ No, I can 't dance
‎ Yes, hands can 't touch your ass, Jerry‎ It 's not the 1960s anymore
‎ This week 's focus is on the erogenous zone inside the vagina
‎ As for the main erogenous zone‎ You can see the flyer‎ It is the clitoris‎ The clitoris is at the top of the labia majora
‎ This is the great clitoris

‎ It 's not actually going away, but . . .
‎ - Yes‎ - Yes, I was thinking . . .
‎ If it has not been turned on for six years, it should have grown spider webs, right?
‎ Are you referring to your vagina?
‎ yes
‎ What I want to ask is ‎ If I haven 't been touched for a long time, will I still feel anything?
‎ I can assure you‎ vaginal orgasms don 't go away with age‎ or lack of contact

‎ In fact, we have many more ways to . . .
‎ please wait for me



‎ You will be fine soon!
‎ Stop!

‎ My pot . . . ‎ well placed‎


‎ This is the colander


‎ hands off
‎ This has nothing to do with the pot holder, right?
‎ you. . . ‎ you. . . ‎ everywhere
‎ Your stuff is everywhere
‎ And why do you have so much change?
‎ I don 't think it 's okay to be quiet for two seconds, because‎ you 're here again
‎ and there and there

‎ We are dating
‎ I kissed Remy



‎ look
‎ Three more drills

‎ hateful


‎ All right, everyone
‎ Please pick up your hand mirror
‎ Come to me after the end, I have something to help you‎ Reboot


‎ Don 't you think we should turn around?
‎ No, Otis, it 's your turn
‎ - I don 't want to play‎ - ok
‎ I never had to choose between my girlfriend‎ and the girl I had a crush on


‎ This has something to do with that mysterious Maeve, right?
‎ Please, Otis, open up to your dad
‎ we are friends

‎ I used to like her

‎ She only considered me a friend at the time, but now she says she likes me too
‎ Then my girlfriend found out
‎ So. . .
‎ Now I have to choose between‎ never seeing Maeve again or losing my girlfriend
‎ I have faced a similar impasse
‎ It was a tough decision‎ but your heart‎ is the most honest
‎ Are you and your mother like this?
‎Well, sometimes‎ your partner just isn 't for you, Otis

‎ - Well . . . ‎ - Everything is fine, right? dad
‎ It 's okay, I 'm just looking for directions
‎ This thing is broken, do you have a map?

‎ Do you want to use my phone?
‎ No, the map is enough
‎ That 's right

‎ here
‎ That 's right, definitely this way
‎ probably shouldn 't drink

‎ (Browns Grocery Store)
‎ Have you ever had a strange dream?

‎ Hey!
‎ - I 'm talking to you‎ - I don 't dream
‎ - Everyone dreams‎ - No, I smoke too much marijuana
‎ What about spring dreams?
‎ - With another guy? ‎ - I just said I don 't dream anymore
‎ I had a spring dream last night about a girl
‎ Although we didn 't really have sex, we were just kissing
‎ - I just can 't stop thinking about it‎ - Dreams are not real
‎ That 's why it 's called a dream
‎ What do you think it means when I dream of a girl in a spring dream?
‎ I don 't know
‎ Google it like everyone else
‎ You didn 't answer my question just now
‎ Where did you learn to dance?
‎ We lived with a lady for a while‎ She was a former ballroom champion and she danced badly
‎ But she has a good sense of rhythm, so . . .
‎ - What does 'for a while' mean? ‎ - Physically handicapped children
‎ Never spend too long in a foster home
‎ I 'll beat you up if you look sad

‎ I see your mom keeps coming to Rehab Anonymous
‎ It feels like she is not easy

‎ Yes, it 's none of your business
‎ Cynthia says she suddenly disappeared years ago
‎ - Poison bugs hate it the most‎ - She 's been out of drugs for two years
‎ Yes, everyone has heard this
‎ You don 't know me‎ or my mom, okay?
‎ I thought we two orphans were going to have a heart-to-heart bond
‎ You are wrong
‎ I didn 't mean to cross the line, sorry
‎ Maybe your mom is really different, like... . .
‎ Change starts now, right?
‎ - Did you just make it up? ‎ - no, it 's them
‎ Slogans on posters
‎ Should be changed to: 'One Day Poisonous' Lifetime Poisonous '
‎ you are really annoying
‎ Who do you pay more attention to when walking down the street? ‎ Man or woman?

‎ both will
‎ - I thought everyone was like this‎ - I only pay attention to girls
‎ They are everywhere

‎ Then I 'm Pansexual
‎ What is that? ‎ What the hell is pan?
‎ I know a guy . . . ‎ who used to stuff his dick into the vacuum head
‎ this is normal
‎ Pansexuality refers to being attracted to someone‎ but not because of their physical or psychological gender
‎ it was you who developed feelings for this person‎ and not through their genitals

‎ This actually makes sense
‎ I have absolutely no idea


‎ You should have been there three hours ago
‎ Yes, I came over
‎ I really like to walk, it 's super hot
‎ - Super energetic? ‎ - Yeah, that 's what I meant


‎ I 'm sorry, I didn 't mean to



‎ Don 't you want to do it?
‎Why do you think so?
‎ - You keep hitting me on the head‎ - Why don 't we watch a movie?
‎ good
‎ Are you really all right?
‎ I think after the bus incident, you 're a little weird
‎ - Do you want to talk? ‎ - I 'm fine, Steve
‎ I 'm just a little tired from walking, go get a laptop




‎ There are places where you can be jealous
‎ - When he texts you . . . ‎ - he won 't
‎ He will surely pass
‎ You must also ask him to wait at least two and a half hours before coming back
‎ - Why do you play so many games? ‎ - It 's good to start
‎ Then you will be attracted to each other 's personality
‎ When were you attracted to someone 's personality?
‎ Of course I have
‎ - I really like someone‎ - preferably
‎ You must be hooked on Maeve Willie 's love for feminist literature
‎ Not because of her big tits
‎Why are you so mean?
‎ Because a guy like you will never notice a girl like me
‎ All your lovers look the same
‎ It 's so obvious
‎ You know I really like Maeve
‎ What do you like about her?
‎ It 's a feeling, isn 't it?
‎ I can 't tell
‎ 'Love is seen through the eyes of the heart, not the eyes of the naked eye, so Cupid, the goddess of love with small wings, was painted by the artist blindfolded'
‎ - A Midsummer Night 's Dream ‎ - Exactly
‎ I also read his other plays
‎ I 'm not sure about the goblin part‎ but he 's not bad
‎ I think you should tell your mother about your participation in the play
‎ she will be very proud of you
‎ Excuse me, were you just complimenting me? still. . .
‎ If you 're not so lazy, memorize your lines
‎ Yes, whatever
‎ thank you today
‎ small things
‎ to break
‎ Hey Wei
‎ how?
‎ I noticed you
‎ I noticed a girl gave her phone number‎ to Dex


‎ goodbye
‎ two and a half hours
‎ good

‎ Dad, we 're lost
‎ We are not lost
‎ What does the map say?
‎ This is a bargain
‎ It 's okay to admit that it 's okay to get lost
‎ I won 't admit anything‎  'Cause we 're not lost
‎ You two!
‎ Hey!
‎ - I think I see our luggage‎ - look
‎ Let 's just say we 're not lost
‎ OMG!
‎ My hat!
‎ Okay, let 's pitch the tent
‎ This will pop off by itself, right?
‎ Yes, just open the bag, and then just . . .
‎ and it will pop
‎ you have to untie . . . the straps


‎ Dad?
‎ OK, do you think it 's you who will win?
‎ Is it? I 've met worse guys than you
‎ How many fucking PhDs do you have? you. . .
‎ This bastard!
‎ Play a ghost!
‎ Why don 't we go to a hotel?
‎ No, we 're not going to the damn hotel
‎ Please give me two rooms

‎ Buy those for what?
‎ I just want to buy
Ya Tataka Ryo

‎ I want a divorce

‎ okay

‎ I have something to tell you
‎ But you can 't be mad I didn 't tell you
‎ Do you remember last term‎ I was placed on school probation with Adam?
‎ Um‎ He gave me a blowjob

‎ and since he came back‎ we 've been out for walks late at night‎ and we 've been shaking, smashing things, and kissing all the time. . . ‎ it feels great
‎ Why are you so expressionless?
‎ Because he bullies you
‎ - It 's been years, Eric, he 's a scumbag‎ - but people change
‎ If he really changed, why did he let you sneak out late at night?
‎ That 's romantic
‎ You are too busy pretending to like your girlfriend‎ How would you know that? Everyone knows that the person you really like is Maeve
‎ - No, you take that back ‎ - You take your words back
‎ - What about Racine? ‎ - Omg
‎ He is not afraid of losing face when he is with you
‎ - Don 't suddenly stand on Racine 's side‎ - What do you mean?
‎ The reason why you react so much
‎ It 's all because you don 't like it, only you haven 't changed
‎ No, Eric‎ Now it 's your powerful self-loathing
‎ Make you fall in love with someone who doesn 't value you at all
‎ Don 't analyze me, Otis
‎ You don 't know the reality I 'm facing
‎ okay
‎ whatever you want
‎ But. . .
‎ Ask yourself . . . why on earth are you hiding?
‎ Why? Delia, don 't hang up!

‎ (to Maeve, I 'm confused, we need to talk)



‎ Don 't go . . .
‎ let 's go

‎It 's you who cheated again
‎ You came here because you have nowhere to go

‎ Adam, can you come down?
‎ I 'm going to divorce your dad
‎ Want to eat mango?
‎ I 'm sorry for what I said last night
‎ I just don 't want you to hide something from me
‎ I 'm afraid you will have an opinion

‎ - I just don 't want you to get hurt‎ - oh
‎ But if you think he has changed, then I believe you
‎ I didn 't mean to say that Euler
