‎ My brother and I come to teach once a week
‎ - Where did you learn to dance? ‎ - Learn a little bit in the East and a little bit in the West
‎ This is what happened while serving in the army‎ When I went to Afghanistan for the second time

‎ - I 'm lucky to be alive‎ - I didn 't ask
‎ but you want to ask
‎ I don 't pity you

‎ This week 's focus is on the pleasure spots in the vagina
‎ If you look at the brochure, the main point of pleasure‎ is the clitoris‎ at the top of the labia majora

‎ It doesn 't actually show up but . . .
‎ What 's the matter?
‎ Yes I wonder . . . ‎ If your bike sits in the garden for six years‎ it might rust right?
‎ Is the bike you 're talking about your vagina?
‎ Yes
‎ My question is‎ if you haven 't been touched in a long time, would you still feel it?

‎ In fact‎ we have many ways . . .
‎ please wait a moment



‎ You said it won 't be long!
‎ Stop!
‎ And three more screws

‎ Ok ladies
‎ Please pick up your handheld mirror
‎ Come to me when it 's over‎ I have something that might help you . . . ‎ Get back on the bike


‎ Do you guys think we should go back?
‎ No Otis it 's your turn
‎ I don 't want to play
‎ Well I never had to be in girlfriends
‎ Choosing between the girl I have a crush on


‎ Is it about that mysterious Maeve?
‎ Please tell Otis to your dad
‎ we are friends
‎ I used to have feelings for her more than that

‎She didn 't feel that way at the time‎ but she told me now that she has feelings for me
‎ My girlfriend found out
‎ So. . .
‎ I have to make a choice now‎ Either cut off with Maeve‎ or break up with my girlfriend
‎ Well I had a similar experience
‎ It 's hard to decide‎ but inside . . . ‎ will listen to your voice
‎ Is that the case with your mother?
‎ Well sometimes you . . . ‎ you go with the wrong person Otis

‎ - Hmm . . . ‎ - Are you all right Dad?
‎ Hmm just wanted to make sure my . . . ‎ current direction
‎ This thing is broken do you have a map?

‎ Do you want to use my phone?
‎ No need to have a map

‎ (Brown Country Store)
‎ Have you ever had a strange dream?

‎ Hey!
‎ - I 'm talking to you‎ - I don 't dream
‎ - everyone dreams‎ - it wasn 't me who smoked too much marijuana
‎ What about spring dreams?
‎ - Dreaming of other men? ‎ - Listen to me, I don 't dream, okay?
‎ I had a spring dream last night about a girl
‎ Even though we didn 't actually go to bed‎ Just kissing
‎ I just can 't help but keep thinking
‎ unreal dreams
‎ That 's why it 's called a dream
‎ If I dream of sleeping with a girl‎ What do you think it means?
‎ I don 't know
‎ Search Google like everyone else
‎ You didn 't answer my previous question
‎ Where did you learn to dance?
‎ We lived with a lady for a while‎ She used to be a ballroom dancer who was nasty
‎ But she 's very rhythmic so...
‎ - What do you mean by 'for a while'? ‎ - Foster family
‎ Never leave a disabled child for too long
‎ I 'll beat you up if you look sad

‎ I see your mom is a regular at Drugs Anonymous
‎ She seems interesting

‎ It 's none of your business
‎ Cynthia says she left years ago
‎ - Poison bugs are the worst‎ - She hasn 't smoked in two years
‎ Well we 've all heard it
‎ You don 't know me‎, and you don 't know my mother, okay?
‎ I thought we would get along well
‎ all orphans
‎ you are wrong
‎ Hey I didn 't mean to cross the line sorry
‎ Maybe your mom is different I mean . . .
‎ Real change brings change, right?
‎ Is this your current work?
‎ No that 's a quote from their poster
‎ I think I should write 'Once a drug addict, a lifetime addiction'
‎ You 're an asshole, you know?
‎ ( Your sexuality? )
‎ Who do you pay more attention to when you walk down the street? ‎ Man or woman?

‎ both
‎ I think everyone does
‎ I only pay attention to girls
‎ They are everywhere

‎ I 'm obviously pansexual
‎ What? Like . . . ‎ Fucking pots and pans?
‎ I used to know a guy who . . . ‎ he likes to stick his dick in the duct of a ‎ vacuum cleaner and that 's normal

‎ Pansexuality means you are attracted to the person, not the gender of the person
‎ The point is the connection you have with that person‎ not the connection with their genitals

‎ Makes sense
‎ I don 't think it makes sense


‎ You should have been there three hours ago
‎ Well I came
‎ I like walking very much now
‎ Refreshing
‎ Are you refreshed?
‎ That 's what it means


‎ oh sorry
‎ I didn 't mean to



‎ Don 't you want me to do it?
‎Why do you think so?
‎ You keep hitting me on the head
‎ Maybe we can watch a movie or something
‎ good
‎ Are you sure you 're all right?
‎ I just think you 've been a little weird since the bus thing
‎ Do you want to talk?
‎ No Steve
‎ I 'm just tired of walking
‎ go get a laptop




‎ . . . one thing is enviable
‎ - when he texts you . . . ‎ - he won 't text me
‎ He will definitely text you
‎ You must make him wait at least two and a half hours before replying to him
‎ Why do you play so many tricks?
‎ only at the beginning
‎ You 'll end up liking each other 's personality
‎ When did you like whose personality?
‎ I liked
‎ - I used to like someone a lot‎ - yeah
‎ Maeve Wiley 's love of feminist literature ‎ is sure to keep you thinking
‎ It has nothing to do with the size of her tits
‎ Why are you so sensitive and irritable?
‎ Because a guy like you would never look at a girl like me
‎ All your prey‎ looks like it was made in a lab
‎ It 's obvious
‎ I used to like Maeve
‎ Why do you like her so much?
‎ Just feeling it doesn 't it?
‎ I really can 't explain
‎ 'Love is not seen with the eyes, but felt with the heart, so Cupid with wings is always blindfolded'

‎ I 've been reading his other plays lately
‎ I 'm not sure if there 's a elf‎ but he 's nice
‎ I think you should tell your mom‎ You were in a school play

‎ It 's okay to admit we 're lost
‎ I won 't admit anything‎  'Cause we didn 't get lost
‎ Two!
‎ Two!
‎ - Two I think I see our stuff‎ - Look!
‎ I said we didn 't get lost
‎ Oh my gosh!
‎ My hat!
‎ Okay let 's put up the tent
‎ This is an automatic pop-up tent, right?
‎ Yes just open the bag and . . .
‎ It will pop up automatically
‎ You have to pull the strap


‎ Dad?
‎ Well do you think you won?
‎ Is it? I 've been through the worst
‎ How many damn Ph.Ds did you get? you. . .
‎ You bloody bastard!
‎ Pop up heck!
‎ Why don 't we find a hotel?
‎ No we don 't look for the damn hotel
‎ Hey two rooms please
‎ ( Chelmsley Hall Inn &amp; Spa)
‎ Jane

‎ What are these for?

‎ Didn 't he call you his boyfriend?
‎ okay

‎ I have to tell you something
‎ okay? I didn 't tell you before you can 't be angry
‎ Do you remember last term‎ I was left after class with Adam?
‎ Um. . . ‎ He gave me a blowjob

‎ Since he came back‎ We 've been walking late at night‎ We smashed things and kissed. . . . ‎ Crazy kisses were wonderful
‎ Why is your face expressionless?
‎ Because he bullied you . . .
‎ - Bullied Eric for years he hates ‎ - No but people change
‎ If he changed‎ Why let you sneak around at night?
‎ very romantic
‎ You won 't know because you 're busy‎ pretending to have feelings for your girlfriend‎ Everyone knows you love Maeve
‎ - don 't take it back‎ - you take back what you said
‎ - What about Raheem? ‎ - gosh
‎ He 's with you without being ashamed
‎ - Stop pretending you 're on Raheem 's side‎ - What do you mean?
‎ I think that 's the point
‎ You don 't like to see others change‎ and you stay the same
‎ Not Eric the point is you hate yourself
‎ so that you will fall in love‎ with someone who is not as good as you
‎ Don 't give me counseling Otis
‎ You don 't know my real situation
‎ okay
‎ do what you want
‎ okay? but. . .
‎ Ask yourself‎ What is your real reason for hiding?
‎ Why . . . De Laia? Don 't hang up!
