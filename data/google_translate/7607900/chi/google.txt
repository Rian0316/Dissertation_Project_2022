Came here from the Johnson Space Center in Houston from the J ohnson S pace C enter in Houston
Talk to us all about our space program totalktousaboutourspa ceprogram .
Yes I know what y 'all are thinking A ndyeah , I knowwhatyou  ' rethinking . These two were roommates Theseguyswereroomies .
How could one become . . . Howdoesonegoontobea . . .
while the other is teaching high school science and theother  ' teaching freshmanscie nce
And still teach atapublichighschool in public schools? What 's up SheldonYeah, Sheldon.
I was thinking about this just now. I was thinking that.
Thank you Thankyou .
ok let 's welcome my good brother dr ronaldo hodges tomygoodbuddy , d r
R o n a l d   H o d g e s .
Hi kids, nice to be here Hey, kids.
H e y .
G ladtobehere . Answer to your questions A nd , uh , Hubert , the answertoyourquesti onis , one of the roommates is busy reading oneofthoseroomieswasb usystudying
while the other roommate was busy with high school girls while the other wasoutch asing high school girls .
Yes Yeah.
Let me clarify that those girls are over 18. Tobeclear, theywereallover 18.
Well . . . Y eah . Well . . .
Come on, what I thought would be interesting to talk about today No , what I thoughtwouldbefuntota lkabouttoday
It is the NASA 's plan other than the space shuttle iswhat NASA  ' splanningondoingbeyon dthespaceshuttle . For example, the first manned space mission to Mars, Thingslikethefirstmann edmissiontoMars.
You said U h , yeah .
Did you watch the movie Alien? Didyouseethemovie A liens?
Saw I did .
Do you think that movie is cool D idyouthinkitwascool ?
Forget it, I am very happy to see it. Sure, I enjoyed it.
I 'm also Me , too . Footballplayer , right ?
Yes sir Yes , sir .
Ok but first now No , ofcourse , before we can set out to explore the hesolarsystem before we set off to explore the solar system , there are a few small problems we have to overcome we  ' vegotafewminorproblem stoovercome .
For example, first of all, every launch Nottheleastofwhichis, everytimewelaunch, it costs the U.S. Taxpayers
Hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no.
- you say - if you want to save money - yes
And let them descend into the sea instead oflettingthemd ropintheocean ?
The idea is interesting T hat  ' sacuteidea , but technically impossible but , uh , it  ' snottechnically possible .
Why is it not possible Why hynot ?
It 's hard to explain Well, it 's hardtoexplain.
This involves very complicated mathematics. The mathisprettycomplicated. Maybe I can help you figure it out. P erhaps I could help you with it.

I 'm sure you can do it Well, I betyoucould.

You sure can do it I  'llbetyoucould .
Here 's a NASA patch I 'lltellyouwhat . Hereisa NASA patch .
Take it home and let your mother sew it on your schoolbag Why hydon  ' tyouhaveyourmomsewtha tonyourbookbag ?
Who wants to know how astronauts go to the toilet Now , whoherewantstoknowhow astronautsgotothebath room ?
- i want to know - well - Me .
I do . - O h , right . In fact, when the rocket lifts off, See , now , during liftoff ,
All astronauts wear diapers alltheastronautsweard iapers . Many people often wonder why P eopleoftenwonderwhy I chose
I chose to enter the field of theoretical physics topursueacareerintheo reticalphysics .
I usually answer I usuallyrespondbysaying I want to unravel the core mysteries of how everything works in the universe I wantedtounraveltheinn erworkingsoftheuniverse .

So maybe when Captain Kirk said in the play 'Go on bravely [poo]' Y eah , perhaps when Captain Kirksaid , ' To oboldlygo , ' the Star Trek series 'Go bravely where no one has come' Maybe it means bravely pulling a hemeantinoneofthose , huh ?
But in fact the real reason is Buttherealanswerwas
I want to prove this pig head three wrong I wantedtoprovethisninc ompoopwrong .
Maybe the line in the play is 'Send me shit [History] Koti' Y eah , that  ' sright .
