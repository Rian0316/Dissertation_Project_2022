how is jimmy sweeping the floor
Sweep it, Dad

how are you hello sir don 't know if you can do me a favor
What 's up
I drove into town this morning
Usually I take the train, but today I was in a hurry to get medicine for my son Freddy
he has epilepsy
I knocked over the medicine in my wife 's hand during a seizure this morning
It 's bad to slam it all over the floor
Long story short, I 'm driving into town
I used all the money on me to buy medicine
Then my car broke down
oh my god it 's really
I 've tried to start it but it doesn 't work
Anyway, I just know
before i bring the medicine home
Freddy 's epilepsy could come back anytime
I would be grateful if you could help me
I can check the car for you
Might just be a spark plug issue
I have a box of spark plugs in my pantry
thanks i appreciate it
But if you could give me five bucks . . .
I 'd rather take a taxi than mess with my broken car

ok five dollars
if you can


OK of course
come here dad
come here



Dad, this is a scam, just like the beggar last week

Good rice
All the crooks in town know it
This is a good place to defraud alms
'liar stick' where did you learn the word
Dad 's nonsense
He probably doesn 't have a son at all
he is blackmailing you
Jimmy, what if you 're wrong?
How about this

I 'm sorry to trouble you, I 'll go - I 'll . . . - no no no
- Dad- no no trouble
Come on here, I 'll give you ten dollars

sir you . . .

Really generous
I go to the back storage room
find some spark plugs
Maybe it can help you get your car started
Come on, Jimmy, can you watch it for a while?
be right back


How much is a kohl cigarette
four dollars
good one
pay first


Come on two, oh my god
The spark plug is clearly here
give me one more minute

hurry up





There are two types of human wolf and sheep child in this world
wolf and sheep
Figure out who you want to be

etc
ok found
is he gone
did he just leave
Predecessor

In the later part of the day, the director of Xiaoxin murmured
I 'll get straight to the point
I 'm sorry to tell you that after the incident
Open WeChat and scan the QR code on the left or search the official account: American drama exploded to learn about the latest film and television news subtitle information
Mr. Ermenshot decided to slightly revise the statement
- a little bit - a little bit
He decided that he could no longer be conscientious
Said the gun found at the scene belonged to Toku Salamanga
- whose gun is that - who knows
Do you know how many guns Albuquerque has
as little as a rattlesnake and as many as a grain of sand
so many
Is that your gun, Mr. Ermenshot?
Didn 't he say that, can Mr. Umenshot say it himself?
The gun is not from Salamanca
I only know so much
You said it was his, you said Salamanga pulled out a gun and pointed it at you

he didn 't
- why did you change your statement- good citizen
There is only one person 's fingerprint on the gun
Salamanga 's
How could the gun not be his?
I can 't ask my client about this, right? He 's not an appraisal expert, right?
Who knows, maybe it fell from the beak of a flying bird
Mr. Salamanga caught the gun and wanted to throw it away
I mean there are so many possibilities
Did Salamanga threaten you, Mr. Umenshot?
We want to keep him locked up for a few more years
The gun is the most important thing, you know
Do you want him to come out sooner and hurt you again?
Don 't talk about guns, okay?
The gun is not from Salamanca
If you 're going to take guns as evidence
Mr. Ermenshot will defend the accused
he will clarify
Straightforward and unequivocal

Did he threaten you or bribe you?
Enough is enough, let 's go



you did nothing wrong
This Salamanga is crazy
The latest American drama download
myself too
dealt with him
I didn 't say anything before because of conflicts of interest.
But he 's a psychopath
He took me to the desert
Put a gun to my head
Broke two guys ' legs in front of me if I didn 't convince him he 'd probably take them . . .

I won 't talk about the bloody details, but it 's miserable.
Make it unforgettable

why are you telling me this
Don 't be too hard on yourself
People say prudence is courage
I will do the same
Count me today for no charge

you take the next elevator
charge as usual


ungrateful feed jimmy
did you tell howard
I can 't say yet
you didn 't tell him
I haven 't waited until it 's confirmed before I can say that I will wait until the acceptance letter arrives.

When will you get the offer letter
next thursday
After an interview with a partner
- That 's just a process. - Pretty much
Hope is what conditions are given to you
I mean real
Not as good as what you did at Davis Main.
But you can become a partner after two years
And at HHM it takes five years or never
not bad
And help me pay off my law school loan
How much more thousands of dollars? Only a few thousand is fine. I have other expenses.
I was getting mailroom wages at the time.
15,000 is left unfinished
Swekat really wants to poach you
But Jimmy, why don 't you call me if you have anything to do with me?
see you in a while
if you do well
Bye-Bye




where are you omar
Can Omar help me write a letter?
'Dearest Clifford' not too much
'Dear Clifford' do you think it should be called Clifford or Clifford
I don 't know what letter to read.
It 's alright, you can read and write it, honey, you can add anything
Next 'My heart is heavy like'
No, it sounds like a medical condition
write it like this
'It 's with a heavy heart' Okay
'It is with a heavy heart that I send
'officially submit your resignation' use 'submit' rather than 'turn in'
Are you saying your resignation?
' Submitted to Davis Main . . .
' days working here
'It was the most professionally fulfilling period of my life'
What 's up
Isn 't that a bit too much to say? . . .
I just didn 't expect you to be so pissed off here
not angry
Rather . . unhappy

I didn 't see it at all
not your fault mate
You are very capable where did we write
But you worked so hard to get it all
You 'll lose a lot if you give up now
The apartment is indeed . . . nice and has a car
That car is pretty good overall
Plus signing bonus
The bonus is already in their hands and they already gave me the check
I can keep the bonus
unless you quit
Resign within a certain period of time I remember yours is that within a year you have to pay back the money


Yes. . .

this. . .
yes it is here . . . it should be here
Let me see

Omar this
I 'm not serious about the resignation letter and I won 't count a word

I. . .
I 'm just
too much pressure
Too much pressure and frankly adjusting to Davis Main 's work rhythm

more difficult than i expected
So I kinda don 't tell anyone what I just said
I feel something is wrong
It must be wrong because you love working here
love to death
I just lost my mind for a moment.
US
let 's forget about it
No problem, absolutely don 't say it
I feel much better
Sometimes you have to vent what you want to say out loud
Just know how absurd that sounds
thank you Omar
Albuquerque twenty-six miles







Jimmy McGill
Jimmy, this is Al Newman from Union Funeral Home, nice to meet you Al
- nice tie - thank you
Alright let 's get started

















what are you doing
Doug got a juicer for the office
Jimmy is too loud
- Brian comes in - our client is outside
- Good two cups right now- Jimmy
Sometimes too much stuff can get stuck and you have to push hard to do it like this
gosh

Damn splashes all over the place
- did it splash on you - not now jelly jimmy









Can only be upside down to understand?
Because of this, there is the principle of suction lever or something.
This is physical physics
Mr. Clifford wants the floor to be clean
clean
Do you understand? [The above dialogue is mixed with Spanish]
dude i 'm michigan
So you don 't understand a word of what I just said, so good night
Come on, try it upside down







Excuse me
please pay attention
Can you hear it? Well, frankly, I never thought of that.
I 'm going to give this talk in my own career, but I noticed
The toilet is out of order and someone doesn 't flush after using it
Once by accident, twice
Three times to form a pattern and still not pee
yes thank you Erin
I 'm not here to embarrass anyone
I don 't even want to know who did it but . . .
Clifford did it by me
jimmy i said i don 't want to know
We need to save water
I heard the water level in Santa Fe
down five centimeters this year
every flush
Every gallon of water is wasted.
Is there a better way to save money than not flushing?
those are low flow toilet jimmies
You 're going to flush from now on
Low flow is good
good idea










what sound






what 's going on inside Jimmy
Good rice
Can you hear through the door, I didn 't notice sorry
what are you doing
I took your advice
I 'm releasing the pressure
release stress
yeah like you play the guitar
I have to say you are right
This is great for stress relief
The sound is not very good, but I just learned
I heard the key is to keep this airbag inflated
enough
Put me down quickly, come to my office



you win
what did i win
What did you get fired from Clifford if it was because of that bagpipe . . .
Not because of the bagpipes, of course because of the bagpipes, but because the bagpipes are not flushed
Also because of your... dazzling so-called suit
Because . . . because you want to keep your winnings
all because of this
You 've been brushing up on contract law lately, you obviously want to get out of here
But you can 't quit or the bonus won 't be guaranteed if I fire you for your misconduct
I should have fired you while you were doing commercials . . . no bonus but
If you 're fired for being a jerk for no reason
you can make it
If you think I 've committed any malfeasance . . .
Save it
I can argue with you but I don 't want to waste time for you
you 'd better go away

I 'm sorry you think so
I 'll go . . . pack up

First of all . . . please don 't take me for a fool
tell me what 's wrong with me
What the hell did I do to make you do this to me
We give you the opportunity to encourage your development
Equipped with a car, a room and a rosewood desk for you
Have you ever seen a table like that here?
you didn 't really think about why

I 'm trying to get used to the real
I just . . . don 't fit in here
If you already knew why you would take the job

I 'm very sorry
how much is that table
seven thousand
I 'll write you a check casually though I don 't know what 's the use
get your table out of here
Clifford anyway, I think you 're a good guy
I think you 're an asshole anyway









Mr. Hamlin, sorry to inform you that I will be resigning







door open

- Jimmy - can I talk to you
does howard know you 're coming
Of course I didn 't know I slipped in
ok but hurry up
Can we actually go to the conference room and talk about why?
It 's more formal
No one 's going to have a meeting before four, I 've seen it

ten minutes maximum
you first
sit down
what . . what 's going on
go ahead
Swekat Cockley will help you pay off your debt to Hamlyn McGill
and promote you to partner after two years
obviously yes
What 's the deal? Do you want to consider a better job opportunity?

Who gave Hamlin McGill Associates?

I
I 'll make you a partner tomorrow
prove it
Wexler McGill Partnership
you with me
Swekat can help you pay off your debt, so can I
Plus my signing bonus
You can start from scratch and have a great future
We work well together
What do you know, what are you hesitating about?
Dedicate yourself to being your own boss
Build our future together 'Be your own boss'

Where 's the client from? You just signed with Mesa Verde Bank, didn 't you?
It 's hard to poach them
Then find another Mesa Verde Bank
It 's all your gold
How hard is it for you to sign this and another? You put it lightly

not the man in front of you
But I lived in a nail salon for many years.
Of course, it 's not easy, it must take a lot of hard work and sweat
At least it must have been tough at first
But in the end we 'll have our business entirely
It 's worth it and it can fail empty handed
You 're right, it 's a gamble, it 's a big gamble
Yes, but you 're betting on yourself
As far as I 'm concerned you have a good chance of winning
You are a great lawyer and this is your chance to show the world


so why don 't i go to swekat they also make me a partner
And they have a solid reputation as a law firm
This is undeniable
You shouldn 't just settle for a lateral move like that. That 's what Swekat stands for. He 's just another Howard Hamlin.
You keep talking about me and Swekat, what about you and Davis Main
It 's over. I resigned today. Technically, I was fired.
what 's wrong
this is

If the two of us were to become law firm partners
one thing i need to confirm
what kind of lawyer would you be
I don 't mean what area you specialize in, I mean do you follow the rules?
Or keep playing tricks
I will follow the rules and never go out of style
I will be very cautious



What 's the point of it if I can 't be myself
Every time I do things the way someone else does
I 'd all screw things up at Davis Main
see how it turns out
I almost ruined your career and pissed everyone off
I 've always tried to live by other people 's expectations
I don 't know how long ago it was Chuck
Then it 's you, it 's not your fault
That 's my own choice
But if we 're going to do it, I 'm going to be myself
So yes
I guess I 'll keep playing tricks.
what do you think
I 'm just
I don 't understand why we have to work together
we have already. . .
Why are you still pulling me in?
i don 't need you i want you

you already have me . . .
Just not a partner



I have to go back to work
Are you alright?
I 'm fine. I 'll go.

see you then
See you soon




You also saw that this house is ready to move in
It has been renovated in the past three years
The floors and kitchen are new and the space is great

Do you think this house is too much?
not too much
Look at that backyard
Isn 't it great that they left the little house here?
Kelly must be in love
- She must be in and she doesn 't want to come out - huh?
the most important is
The surrounding schools are very good and the neighbors are also very good
I called the police district and asked about the crime rate
It 's one of the lowest in the city
And he has a good tone and sounds responsible
it 's nice
Yes
Do you like it? I am happy when you are happy
How do you like it
I like it but I
- but what - it takes a lot of money
I know I keep repeating but it does cost a lot of money
You don 't have to worry about buying it no matter how much
- Mike - I mean it
stop thinking about it
buy it if you want

We can go to the office to apply for loan pre-approval or something
