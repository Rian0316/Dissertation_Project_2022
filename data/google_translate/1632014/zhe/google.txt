* * * * * * * * * * * * * * What happened to Robin?
* * * * * * * * You 're right she 's just pissed
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Four days passed and she never mentioned moving
* * * * * * * * * * * * * But listen we can 't do shit like this anymore
* * * * * * agree
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I actually even wrote another letter to myself
* * * * * * * * Dear future Barney
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * You think you want to get Robin back but you really are not
* * * * * * * * let it go
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Tribute to past Barney
* * * * * * * * * let me see
- * * * * * * * * - * * * * * * * - give me back - ok
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * PS : The above is the letter that fooled T ed, okay?
* * * * * Now get back together with Robin * * * * * * * * * * * * * but don 't tell T ed because he 'll mess with you again
* * * * * * I drew a bunch of big breasts on the back
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ok ok listen to me
* * * * * * What a lovely boob
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * really good
