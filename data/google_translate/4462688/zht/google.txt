good job friends

Good morning
New Mexico State Banking Regulatory Commission meeting now
Today came Mesa Verde Bank and they were represented by Charles McGill
So glad you 're back Charles
Thank you so much to be back
I 'm with my colleague Howard Hamlin
I have the pleasure of introducing you to Mr. Kevin Wachtel
President and Chairman of the Mesa Verde Group and Ms. Paige Novick Senior Legal Counsel for Mesa Verde
welcome
The staff believes that the application basically meets the passing criteria
right
if you allow
Mr. Vochtel would like to give a briefing in support of his application


Mr. Commissioner Ladies and Gentlemen of the New Mexico Office of Banking Regulatory
I am fortunate to be sitting in front of you this morning
We believe our proposed expansion is in the public interest of Arizona and our state
For forty-six years Mesa Verde Bank Trust staff have been proud of our personal service and attention to detail that is second to none
Mesa Verde 's Tier 1 leverage ratio remains at 1 1 . 2 % We
Wait
I 'm sorry Mr. Vochtel, wait a minute
What 's up
just ask
Is there anything we need to explain, Mr. Commissioner?
have
Can you tell us the address of the proposed Scottsdale branch
The latest American drama download
of course can
Scottsdale, Arizona
1 2 1 6 Rosella Road 8 5 2 6 2
Okay, the application I 'm looking at now
Clearly written 1 2 1 6 No. 1 2 1 6 Yes sir
But in your original submission it was 1 2 6 1 Rosella Road
- Yes 1 2 6 1 - 1 2 6 1
If you double check it should be 1 2 1 6
Seems to be two different addresses
Mr. Commissioner, I have a copy of the Notice of Intent that was published in the Arizona and New Mexico newspapers.
It clearly states that the address is 1 2 6 1 Rosella Road
Mr. Commissioner . . .
1 2 6 1 Rosella Road Yes I have a Notice of Intent but on the official submission
The address is written as 1 2 1 6 so . . . which is correct
Mr. Commissioner, can I exchange views with the client?
no problem please
Definitely number 1 2 6 1
you got it wrong IMHO you are making a mess
'chaos'

Look
Seeing myself this is clearly a mistake
yes 1 2 6 1 yes
Of course I know where my bank is
let 's all calm down
I 'm sure I 've remodeled a building at 1261 Rosella Road
I don 't know where 1 2 1 6 is
I don 't quite understand . . . 1 2 6 1
- is 1 2 6 1 - is there anything wrong with that
no sure no problem
sorry sir
Somehow in our file
There seems to be a contradiction so is the correct address 1 2 6 1 on the notice of intent?
it seems so
We would like to request . . . a few minutes so we can change the file to the correct address
I can allow the adjournment but . . . there may not be a rehearing today
When can the hearing be rescheduled
Staff advised they had been investigating 1216 Rosella Road
So our people have to go to a new address - from scratch - if . . .
If we can get a tentative agreement today to allow the branch to open . . .
No IMHO it is your responsibility to submit accurate documents

Best to check again next time
Now the fastest time for a rehearing should be Friday in six weeks.
We can 't wait six weeks
Mr. Commissioner Mesa Verde Bank has expended effort and resources to prepare the branch to open immediately
Although there is a rare precedent, we would appreciate a temporary permission
Time is of the essence . . .
Charles I 'm sorry we 'll see you in six weeks
That 's it for today
Staff please specify
Mesa Verde to return in six weeks
At that time, the application will be re-hearing
Already scheduled, we will expedite all new investigations

impossible
This is impossible



1 2 6 1 Impossible
Chuck
I do not understand

I don 't understand it 's number 1 2 1 6
That 's right, I checked it out
Check it again, Chuck Happened and it Happened
We accept failure and move on
It 's not just your fault that so many attorneys and assistants in the firm are negligent
including myself
Yes 1 2 1 6 I promise
everyone makes mistakes

it 's not a mistake

Greek Dessert House





I invite everyone here to have a drink
- really - that 's right

listen up guys
This gentleman wants everyone to have a drink

Okay, use your knees
So what does 'with the force of the knee' mean?
I don 't know what a sweaty person would say, come on
one two Three



- okay? - almost
soon, soon, soon
- Okay? - Okay, okay, let it go, let it go



are you OK
A few years of physical therapy will definitely cure
- good- good push

slow down slow down
corner corner corner

right hold that



Hi Peggy
How are you
yes oh no
It 's fine

what
sure
Of course I understand
OK
That 's great
good bye then
And Peggy, thank you
thanks

I
Good rice
what 's wrong
I
Mesa Verde Bank is back
- really - really

- Awesome unbelievable - yeah

What happened to me at Hamlin McGill Associates
Peggy didn 't elaborate
She just said the document failed
we meet this afternoon
look at me
Good people always have good rewards

There seems to be some regulatory issues
Kevin is still worried that a lawyer is incompetent
you can
I 'll have to hire a paralegal, maybe two, I 'm sure I 'll pay it alone


No, we will pay equally
I need to get a Wanlaw database terminal quickly.
I don 't even know who to call for this kind of thing
It 's all high-end stuff, but it 's no small job Jimmy
very complicated

Kim, are you okay?
take it easy

Take a deep breath and enjoy the victory

you 're right
of course i 'm right



It 's Ernie


what 's up with Ernie
yeah no peppa just called me

Chuck said why
when then
ok go now

Okay thank you
Mesa Verde 's files
Chuck said he could give it to me

real
so fast
Yeah, I 'll change my clothes and go
- Need help? - It depends
Are you helping to move boxes or just gloating around
Have a little bit of both

discharge
what
just touch that thing


what 's the matter

- Jimmy hello Kim hello - Ernie hello
Something went wrong with the lock
McGill told me to call the locksmith to replace it
why?


Why did Chuck change the lock?
Ernesto, I 'm fine here
You must go back to the office
I 'm leaving
- Thank you - bye Jimmy bye Kim
- Bye bye Ernie- Bye bye Ernie
So what happened to Chuck Lock?
I want to tell you these things, Kim
but
I think it 's time to clear up all the facts
clarify what facts
he framed me
what did you say bro
Please save it
You and I know what I 'm going to say
I have no idea
Yesterday morning was the biggest humiliation of my career
A small word order issue wasted the client 's money and time and ruined my reputation forever
but i found out it 's not an error

not at all
One night a week ago I slept on the couch and almost lost consciousness and here comes Jimmy
Ernesto
My good brother will take care of me personally
He flipped through my Mesa Verde papers in the middle of the night
we don 't have to listen to your nonsense
she has to listen
Listen well for your own good
Here are thirteen documents marked with the address of the proposed branch of Mesa Verde Bank 1261 Rosella Road Scottsdale, Arizona
Jimmy pulled out every document and left me here sweating delirious and ran out and tampered with them
you need a copier
Where did you go to some copy shop that was open all night?
After careful cutting and pasting he made a copy that was nearly identical to the original
There is only one key difference
1 2 6 1 Rosella Road became 1 2 16 Rosella Road Sounds like a big project
No one says you are lazy, you have all kinds of shortcomings, but you are not lazy
If you want to know if Jimmy is capable of forging paperwork then I 'll tell you
He made a fortune in high school by forging ID documents
Did you mention getting his brothers all beer and high school?
You are like Mozart

They 've been gifted since childhood

When he came back he put the copy in my file
Then my thoughtful brother left the next day
He knew I would use his doctored documents to write the Mesa Verde application report
It is true that I do it over and over again
Enter 1 2 1 6 instead of 1 2 6 1
I was thinking 'Rosella Road 1216' is the next year of 1215' is the second year after the signing of the Magna Carta'
God Chuck, are you crazy?
So you mean that the addresses above these files are all wrong
Of course you won 't leave evidence
I guess you waited until I was gone yesterday morning and got in the door with your key and returned the original documents
A crime that is not covered up is incomplete
God please why am I doing this for what business?

he 's all for you

You must have no idea about it
It must have been his own idea to see this as some kind of twisted romance
Chuck, you should lie down and put a cold towel on your forehead.
Now you know you have no choice
It 's about the principal a deceived principal
As a sworn attorney as a formal attorney for Mesa Verde Bank you can only go to Kevin Vachtel
put it all together
His whole set of rhetoric is just to get his client back
- for that purpose - not at all
If they still decide after learning the truth . . .
You can 't stand they chose her over you
I can 't stand my own brother stabbing me in the back
I can 't stand you cheating on this young lady
- Let her fall so far - 'Fall'
Is it the 1840s?
What did you say she didn 't fall
Good rice

if what you say is true
Jimmy will be charged with forgery, forgery, forgery, forgery and even trespassing
To be honest, I 'm also sad
But facts are facts
do you have evidence
evidence
The proof is that I know my brother very well
Chuck has something else to explain a simpler explanation
you read wrong
I do not
You work under the oil lamp squinting at the ten pound print
Mistake 1 2 6 1 for 1 2 1 6
It 's perfectly normal and I could have made the same mistake
I 'm not mistaken
it 's you who got it wrong
I know you like Jimmy
Many people like it but please open your eyes
You made a mistake and instead of facing it you accused your brother of framing you
Concocted such a well-planned conspiracy
He can do it, I know he can
I know he has a lot of flaws
I know he likes to take shortcuts
But you made him like this
he worships you
he accepts you
he takes care of you
He just wants your love and support but you just point fingers at him
you never believed him
you never wanted him to succeed
do you know
i feel sorry for him
feel sorry for you too







what the hell

what does gold do

drive me





Alright, line up according to the class
find your buddies
kids come
we go

Come on
- Hurry up and get to your place - this way?
That 's right here

Shoot me heroic

Get your neck healed too

Forget it, let me see
It 's just the bottom line
Am I dying of tuberculosis?
People your age are not so rosy

I just want to outline your jaw
My chin is already contoured
so you stand over
squat a little

A little more left
That 's what I mean
There must be an easier way to shoot
It 's free but you don 't have to be brave enough to make a movie

ready to shoot
Okay, let 's get started, let 's finish
rhubarb rhubarb nine o 'clock direction

Excuse me
are you in charge here
yes this is school land
i was looking for you
It would help us a lot if you could get the kids in that building to be quieter
let them do some exercises or something
Just two or three minutes quickly
This is school land and no one is allowed to enter without permission
Of course
- Didn 't Annette tell you? - Who is Annette?
of the executive 's office
Do you know a man named Annette in town? No?
sorry for the trouble
We 're doing 'Fixing Shots' . . .
You 're not allowed to shoot anything until I figure it out for five minutes at the most.
Documentary we are making a documentary
Yes. . .
I heard there was an exhibition or a commemorative plaque or something
do you know where
Why do we have a plaque
Because the people who went to school here
who ever went to school here
Rupert Holmes
It 's a documentary about him
sorry who
Rupert Holmes
Rupert Holmes singer-songwriter
'Song of Pina Colada'
a cocktail
you sure know me . . .

*If you like Pina Colada being trapped in the rain* *If you don 't like yoga it 's a bit of a brain* *If you like midnight sex*
* Dunes beside the promontory *
You know Lu . . . look at her face
- Rupert Holmes - did he go to school here?
yeah 64 's
He still often says that this school was built in 1971
He went to school in the old building before that
We kind of . . . how to say art re-creation
Isn 't Rupert Holmes British?
Yeah it 's a little fun, but he spent his teenage years in Albuquerque
So you call the director 's office and find Annette
We are here waiting for the official reply
- Well if you don 't mind waiting - no
We don 't want to break any rules
won 't be long
No guarantees but I try to keep the kids quiet
That really helped a lot



hurry up now
- hurry up - ok
Don 't do modeling, lower the flag
Remember to be heroic
well you are a hero - big hero - be solemn



start to push
pretty

pretty




- hello Mike - hello Fran
Do you still serve breakfast?
Are you serving the old way?
OK



thanks
is there anything good
no
Did something good happen in the newspaper?
really not much
- Fran - how
excuse me, may I ask
Has it ever snowed here?
Are you going to spend your first winter in Albuquerque?

Yes, I 'm from Philadelphia
what year
If you stay long enough there will be a snow shovel don 't worry
I like shoveling snow
I live in Cedar Crest and it snows a lot
If it 's not enough, you can shovel the snow off my driveway
a word thing
All right
Miss checkout







Hey
we have to talk


I gotta know something tell me right away


what happened we were robbed not long ago
A southbound truck was hijacked
Someone stole 250,000
Now Hector is pissed looking for who did it
The issue is
i think it 's you
The driver was tied up but had no injuries
Anyone who does this kills people without blinking an eye.
But the driver is still alive
I wondered who this guy robbed hundreds of thousands of drug money and left a witness
who doesn 't want to shoot
it 's you

I 'm not here to blackmail you
You want to rob a drug cartel, that 's your business
But the problem is
I 'm going to take orders from that driver, Hector.
We 're gonna see what he knows if he knows you it 's not good for us both
you do not need to worry
But he 's with you, right?
The driver has nothing to do with this
- who is that - only me
Are you saying that there is no one in your ticket?
impossible
how do you know that truck
how do you know it 's in the tire
Want me to say you overestimate your IQ
So the driver doesn 't know anything?
- doesn 't know anything - does he hear you
- No - Hector is still checking competitors now but if he hears from the driver he 's an old Yankee . . .
he didn 't hear me
He just saw a guy in a ski mask
Are you sure
That 's right
you better not get it wrong
why not in the newspaper
what
Truck robbery didn 't the cops make it to the newspaper?
Policemen
the police know nothing
how could be
Is this your purpose
You want the police to catch Hector
why
you are not important to him
He completely forgot about you and I didn 't forget him
You pushed me into the fire pit because you wanted to fix Hector Salamanga
You lead the police to him and to me
If you want money, I understand but you do
It 's crazy, you gotta calm down and get your hands out of that pocket

You gotta understand it 's over
I 'm done with your boss

never mind
why not in the newspaper
'Cause we cleaned up
how to clean up
we are lucky
After you left, a kind person came over
Yelling 'Oh my God'
He untied the driver and the driver called us over
We went over and drove off the truck
as if it never happened
What about the kindhearted person?
Hector smashed his face
We buried him in the desert
I said . . . we cleaned up








How are you today
Meet Paige and Kevin
interviewed some paralegals
And this you

finished the commercial
I 'm not showing off but this is probably the best sixty seconds in TV history
Tomorrow morning between 11:18 and 11:35, drop your work and go to 'Murder Diagnosis'
I write down
do you want to talk about this
not now
never later
I just wanted to say . . . you and Mesa Verde should definitely work together
now . . . everything is fine
Good night
Good night

Your brother is a smart lawyer
The smartest I know no offense
He will be a strong opponent
you are right
He 's the kind of adversary who will find the tiniest holes in your defense
Fighting him against you really has to make sure you 're doing it all right
leave no trace




Open 24 hours






How are you

come in a while


remember me
do not remember
I think you should remember Lance
fun tonight
for some reason
I feel like I have all the answers
feel like
same as canak
Johnny Carlson 's role on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carlson Do you remember Johnny Carlson playing Carnack in the past?
He will answer questions before they are asked
Ed will give him envelopes, right?
Johnny would put it on his forehead and give an answer like 'leave it to the beaver'
American TV series in the 1950s and 60s and then Johnny would open the envelope
The issue is
'What 's in the Raccoon 's Will'
Do you remember it

haven 't you seen it
Let 's get down to business
The man who just walked out of here is named Ernie
He showed you my picture and asked you if I was here that night
He 'll bring his boss now aka my brother and he 'll ask you the same question
'Did you see that person that night?'
the answer is no
understand
did you kill
no
Robbed the bank
I 'm not that great
I sometimes go to the tub and don 't flush the toilet but . . . it 's a brother thing

And we 're both lawyers so... . .
It was a long and boring story
you are not interested

Will this provoke the police?
My brother might tell you that but no
housework
then i understand
tell me what happened to the camera
There 's a video recorder in the back
Go back and re-record every 12 hours
So I 'm on the record now?
How hard is it to erase records
I 'm not sure
Can be cumbersome . . . and expensive
as expensive as a hundred bucks
That 's two hundred bucks
You 'll be a great young man in the future




good evening
Lance, right?
To Lance I 'm Charles McGill
My assistant talked to you before and he showed you this picture
This person was here around the early morning of the 18th, right?

About ...
Eighteenth in the morning

no
You told my assistant he was here and made copies of documents
yes sorry
never been
That 's right
Okay, the evening of the 27th
until wednesday morning
That is, in the early morning of Wednesday the 18th
were you here at the time
I work the night shift so yes
hold on to Lance
Has this guy ever printed something?


I just said no
You said before that he was here
Now he says he never came
which is the truth
When the guy showed me the picture
I thought 'maybe' but now I 'll take a closer look
Feel sorry
how to say
Looks like I read it wrong

child listening carefully
I 'm a court worker investigating a serious case
So you 're a policeman
no i am not i . . . i . . .
Maybe it 's time for Mr. McGill to take you home
Ernesto, don 't treat me like a child
i 'm fine


i 'm not a policeman
I am a lawyer
I have a moral and legal duty to investigate this matter
investigate what
Forgery, fraud, tampering with evidence

trespass
This man . . . is he all right?
I 'm normal
mr mcgill maybe we can
- Take a break and then - Ernie shut up

you think carefully about what you say
I told you he never came
what else do you want me to say
I want you to tell the truth
I know he came, I know what he did
Tell me what you and Ernesto said to me
Stop changing your rhetoric
Excuse me how to change it to 1 1 x 1 4

Excuse me
we are talking
you have to switch to the fourth tray
I 'll show you a more intuitive way to listen
good man
i don 't want to cause trouble
You just... take him away or I 'll call the police, okay?
Don 't go, we 're not done yet
I 've told you enough dude


Quick alarm
please call the police
