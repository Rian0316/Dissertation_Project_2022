 Let 's go . Let 's go . We 're gonna be late !



 Mom , Sheldon 's making faces at me .
 Sheldon !

 - Honey ! -

 George , help !
 Come here , boy . We got it .
 We just got to smack it out .

 Sheldon 's gonna die !
 Sheldon 's gonna die !

 Lord .
 Here we go .
 This is how you do it . Here we go .
 And we shake .
 Honey !





 I 'm calling 911 .



 George , Heimlich !
 Don 't hurt his little ribs !


 Okay , it 's better now . Sheldon !
 Honey .
 Are you okay ?
 Can you breathe ?
 Say something !
 You have to ... throw away ... that jelly .







 I 've never been late to school before .
 I 'm late all the time .
 It 's no big deal .
 I get you to school on time every day .
 Why are you late ?
 I have a lot of people to say hi to in the morning .
 Mom , would you write a note for me ?
 Sure .
 You have the coolest excuse .
 You almost died .
 Did you see Jesus ?
 I saw Count Chocula .
 But feel free to mention my brush with death in the note .
 All right , that 's enough talk about death and dying .
 I came this close to having my own room .
 ends Friday .
 All canned goods are welcome .
 But please ... make sure your cans have labels .
 Needy people have enough problems without having to guess what 's for dinner .
 I 'm sorry I 'm late .
 I have a note .
 You poor thing , you had a medical emergency ?
 Yes , ma 'am .
 I choked on a sausage .
 How big was it ?
 About yay big .


 You 're sitting in my spot .
 Why is it your spot ?
 It 's complicated .
 Just move .
 You 're reading a comic book .
 I am .
 You do understand those are for children .
 Have you ever read one ?
 I outgrew picture books when I was three .
 Just eat your lunch .
 What 's the matter ?
 II don 't think I can eat this .
 You want to trade ?
 My mom made me fish soup again .
 How long do we have to be in this country before I get baloney ?
 No , thank you .
 I 'm not hungry .
 " I 'm not hungry . "
 Three words you never hear in Vietnam .
 Well , here 's something nice .
 You know that Mr. Rosenbloom with the furniture store over by the steakhouse ?
 I don 't think so .
 Sure you do .
 That Hebrew fella with the combover ?
 You mean Jewish ?
 I think they like to be called Hebrew .
 Anyway , he 's asked me to dinner .
 Well , good for you .
 What 'd you say ?
 I said I 'd have to think about it .
 What 's to think about ?
 Well , a lot .
 I mean , assuming he enjoys dinner , he might want a scoop of Meemaw for dessert .
 Mom , the kids .
 I said " dessert . "
 Did you know I was talking about sex ?
 No .
 See ?
 Why aren 't you eating ?
 I don 't think I can .
 Sometimes the different foods touch each other , Sheldon .
 Not the end of the world .
 No , I 'm afraid I 'll choke again .
 Honey , that 's not gonna happen .
 Go ahead , eat your dinner .
 What 's all this about choking ?
 Sheldon almost died this morning .
 - What ? !
 - Yeah . Dad was shaking him upside down like a ketchup bottle .
 It was great .
 Well , you got to eat something , baby .
 Just have a few bites .
 I can 't .
 It 's too risky .
 Dibs on the tater tots .
 All right , I 'll wrap that up for you , and if you change your mind , you can have some later .
 At least drink your milk .
 Sure .


 Sheldon Lee Cooper , if you don 't finish that pork chop , I swear I will chew it up and spit it in your mouth like a mama bird .
 Do it , Mom .
 Do it .
 - Mary , can I speak to you for a second ?
 - No .
 Enough is enough . The boy has got to eat .
 Just give me a minute .
 Start eating , mister .
 You don 't mind , right ?
 How about I cut that pork chop off the bone and throw it in the blender with some gravy ?
 If it fits through a bendy straw , I 'll drink it .
 Coming up .
 Why does he get a pork shake ?
 This is all my fault .
 I rushed him through breakfast the other day , and now look ...
 He is wasting away .
 Come on .
 You can 't blame yourself .
 This isn 't gonna last .
 Remember the time a bee got in the house and he slept under a net for a couple months ?
 This is different .
 - How ? - First of all ,
 You let that bee in .
 The bee was your fault . - Okay .
 - Secondly ,
 This is about his health .
 He is a fragile little boy . He can 't go on like this .
 I 'm not arguing with you .
 Let 's just , you know , give him a little more time .
 Now what ?
 Sounds like your mom 's making margaritas .
 What 's he drinking ?
 Pork chop and gravy .
 I snuck some broccoli in there , too .
 Shh ...

 I 'm real glad you 've been getting out again .
 Me , too .
 We had a nice dinner , took a walk .
 He 's a divorcé , you know .
 I didn 't . It 's not a big deal for those people .
 If they 're not a lawyer , they 're related to one .
 You 're actually cutting the crust off
 - before you blend it ? - I left it . On his tuna sandwich yesterday , he said he could tell .
 Only drank half of it .
 Mary , you think this has gone on long enough ?
 No trouble .
 But it 'd be better if I had two blenders .
 Be better if you stopped coddling him .
 Well , I don 't know what else to do .
 I suggested that we take him to some kind of professional , but you said he 'd outgrow it .
 Well , if you 're looking for a psychiatrist ,
 I bet my new fella 's related to one .
 What do you think ?
 Not sure .
 If we take him to a shrink , it feels like we 're admitting something 's wrong with him .
 He hasn 't had solid food in five weeks .
 Well , if there is something wrong with him , it ain 't constipation .
 Okay .
 Let 's see if we can find somebody .
 Thank you .
 Needs a few more Cheetos .

 The Pennysaver .
 Is this man gonna make me eat solid foods ?
 No , he just wants to talk to you about it .
 Did you tell him I have a lot to accomplish in my life and cannot afford to be killed by an unchewed sausage ?
 Not in those exact words .
 Did you bring the coupon ?
 Hi .
 Welcome .
 You must be the Cooper family .
 We are . Right on , right on .
 This must be Sheldon .
 Put 'er there .
 No , thank you .
 Right on , right on .
 Okay , well , here 's how I 'd like to start .
 Mom and Dad , why don 't you come talk to me first , and then , Sheldon , you and I have a little rap session .
 Folks ?
 Right on , right on .
 Feel free to read any of my comics .
 And you guys feel free to sit on my beanbag !
 40 cents ?
 Outrageous .
 XMen .

 Hey , it 's about me .
 Now , the thing you have to understand is
 Shelly is incredibly bright .
 I mean , his IQ is right up there with Albert Einstein and that English wheelchair fella .
 Cool .
 He 's nine years old and he 's in high school , so you can 't judge him like other kids .
 - I hear ya .
 - George ,
 Tell him about how he 's always going on and on about subatomic particles and such .
 He 'll get to gabbin ' about it .
 We 're accustomed to his quirks and oddities .
 But this whole " being afraid of solid foods " thing , it 's got us thrown .
 Okay .
 Let me just start by saying you came to the right place .
 Sheldon and I happen to have a lot in common .
 I , too , was a special little boy .
 In the fourth grade , I was reading at a seventh grade level .
 And I don 't have to tell you where I was by the seventh grade .
 Tenth .
 I 'm gonna give the beanbag a whirl .
 What are y 'all watching ?


 You know most of those kids are dead , right ?
 What ?
 Alfalfa , Stymie , Buckwheat .
 Even Petey the dog ?
 Especially Petey the dog .
 Thanks for making it depressing .
 You 're very welcome .
 Y 'all want to go get some ice cream ?
 What about dinner ? What about it ?
 Come on .
 Is ALF dead ?
 No , but it 's just a matter of time .

 You 'd be surprised how many children have food phobias .
 - Is that so ? - Yeah .
 When I was Sheldon 's age ,
 I was afraid of that weird skin
 - on top of puddin ' .
 - Really ?
 Me , too . You know , you put a little Saran Wrap on ...
 George .
 Sheldon ?
 Where the hell did he go ?
 Sheldon ?
 Couldn 't have gone far .
 Why not ?
 Right on , right on .
 I checked the bathroom , the stairs .
 He 's not in the building .
 I 'm worried .
 No one 's answering at home .
 Stay calm .
 We 'll find him .
 You know , when I was a kid ...
 Shut up .
 Well ...


 Excuse me , do you have ♪137 ?
 I 'd like to know what happens next , please .
 Back bin in the corner .
 What are you doing here ?
 Hello , Tam . I thought you said comic books are for children .
 I 'm a complicated young man .
 I think we should call the police .
 We don 't need the police .
 We 'll find him . This is all my fault .
 He ran away because we took him to a therapist .
 That 's $15 we ain 't getting back .
 That 's what you 're worried about ?
 No .
 Course not .
 And Sheldon 's fine .
 You know what he 's like .
 If someone took him ,
 I 'm sure they 'll bring him right back .
 I 'm enjoying this , but I 'm having trouble with the onomatopoeia .
 The what ?
 The onomatopoeia .
 Words that imitate sounds .
 " Kthoom . " " Snikt . "
 " Bamf . "
 Writers shouldn 't make up words .
 Somebody made up " onomatopoeia . "
 You challenge me .
 I like that .

 Meemaw , are you gonna have any more babies ?
 Good Lord , no !
 She 's too old to have any more babies .
 Don 't have to have 'em .
 You live long enough , your hair and your teeth start falling out , you start wetting the bed , you get to be one .
 That 's funny .
 We 're gonna have to put a diaper on you .
 You won 't be laughing when you 're doing it .
 I might be .
 Hey , Meemaw , next to Sheldon , who 's smarter , me or Georgie ?
 Me , of course .
 Why you ?
 My head 's bigger .
 It doesn 't matter .
 Tonight is not about Sheldon .
 Yeah , right .
 Everything 's always about Sheldon .
 Yeah .
 Most of the time , it 's like we don 't even exist .
 I guess Sheldon does get most of the attention .
 Maybe that 's a good thing .
 How ?
 Well , if it weren 't for him , your parents would be on ass all the time .
 Yeah .
 I guess I never thought about it that way before .
 Right now , they would be nagging you about cleaning your room and doing your homework .
 You kidding me ?
 Instead , you 're sitting in a parking lot , eating a Blizzard for dinner .
 With cookie dough in it .
 Exactly . While Sheldon is stuck sitting in some boring shrink 's office .
 Mom told me they were taking him for a haircut .

 Yeah .
 Right . Well , when he gets home , say his hair looks good .

 What ?
 Nothing .

 You want one ?
 No .
 Well ... if you change your mind , help yourself .

















 What I find interesting is how many supervillains .
 Doctor Octopus ,
 Doctor Doom , Lex Luthor ,
 Green Goblin , the list goes on and on .
 So ? So if the world doesn 't respect me ,
 I might change sides .


 Good luck .
