 I am in love with you .
 ROB : You knew the rules .
 I will never ...
 leave my wife .
 ( sighs ) So I can tell Rob is still mad about the other night .
 He hasn 't called in days .
 Why would he even be with me if he was so happy with her ?

 BETH ANN :
 This project I 've been involved with , it 's almost over .
 I 'll be home in time for dinner . Every night .
 SlMONE :
 It 's Hector .
 He was the best hairdresser I ever had .
 I 've known for some time about Karl 's indiscretions .
 I saw his car parked at some seedy motel .
 ( gasps )
 What in God 's name ?
 We haven 't seen each other in years .
 Hector was the only person who ever saw me for the man I truly am .
 Stop romanticizing your grubby little fling .
 Do you love him ?
 I do .
 - Hey .
 - Hmm ? You fell asleep .
 - Take this .
 - Uh ...
 I don 't think I should .
 did you two fuck ?
 TAYLOR :
 - ( chuckles nervously ) - We absolutely fucked . TAYLOR :
 Okay .
 This was bound to happen , right ?
 Since we 're all together now .
 All right , let 's talk about my script . I 'm expecting offers in the high six- figure range .
 ( exhales ) Be good to Jade .
 She 's your muse .
 His muse ?
 I am the one who spent the last two years cleaning up the mess he made of our lives .
 - What did he do ?
 - What didn 't he do ?
 Speed , cocaine .
 He 's an addict .
 One of the producers wants a rewrite .
 And if I can get it to them on time , then ...
 I 'm back .
 And the money that will follow , Jade , I can take care of you .

 - You 're it !
 - No , you 're it !
 So , can you ring me up for that , ma 'am ?
 - Bethany .
 - Oh .
 Thank you for meeting me . Yeah .
 I was ...
 I was a little surprised to get your text .
 It 's , um , it 's been a minute .
 Yeah , yeah , I 'm sorry about that .
 I know I kind of disappeared there .
 Yeah .
 Thought maybe you had , uh , found someone else .
 No , no , nothing like that .
 I just , you know ...
 Took a different path for a while .
 - Yeah . Yeah .
 - Yeah .
 All right , Tanya ,
 listen to me .
 You 're gonna go play with your friends while Mommy talks to her friend , okay ?

 - Oh , big girl .
 I see them on the playground .

 She 's so big .

 - Yeah , well , 24 months is like a lifetime in kid- years . - Yeah .

 Okay , so I got this shit from Mexico .
 It 's stepped on a little bit , but it 's good .
 Just , like , 15 % baby laxatives .
 It 'll definitely get you high .
 But this shit just fell off the back of a fucking boat from Colombia .
 Okay , all I did was chop it up and bag it , and I swear to God , Eli , the second you open it , your entire face goes numb .
 Okay , how much ?
 Give you an eight ball for 300 ?
 Or I can do two for five .
 That 's the best I can do , though .
 I 'm trying to save for Tanya 's college fund .
 Well , you 're a good mom .
 Mm .
 All right , I 'll take two .
 Okay .
 Nice to have you back .
 ( door opens )
 SlMONE :
 Karl .
 We need to talk .
 Bloody hell , it 's 7 : 00 in the morning .
 I was so angry with you last night .
 The way you spoke to me .
 Look , Simone ...
 I was up all night thinking to myself ,
 " I wish I 'd never married that man .
 He 's stolen the last ten years of my life . "
 All right , I 'm sorry .
 Here , put that on .
 Why ?
 Just do it .
 All right .
 Then I started thinking about our time together .
 You taught me how to ski ... ... how to tango .
 ( chuckles )
 Hmm .
 How to speak French .
 Asking for more chardonnay is not really speaking French .
 ( laughs ) Most importantly , you taught me how to laugh at myself .
 The truth is , you haven 't stolen anything from me .
 If anything , you 've given me more than I deserved .
 I 'm sorry , the suspense is slightly killing me now .
 Where is this going ?
 Follow me .
 Just to be clear , I still think we should get a divorce .
 Uh , yes , I assumed as much .
 But just because I can 't have you as a husband doesn 't mean I can 't have you as a friend .
 And I do like to keep my friends happy .
 Hector .
 Hello , Karl .
 I have never loved you more than I do in this moment .
 Please , Karl , not in front of the boyfriend .
 ( Hector laughing )
 Hello .
 Sheila .
 Your apartment manager told me you were down here .
 - I was hoping we could get lunch . - Ugh .
 Sorry , I just got called into work .
 Two waitresses are sick .
 I have to clean my uniform and get over to Glendale .
 It 's fine .
 We can catch up another time .
 Well , there 's certainly a lot to catch up on .
 - Has something happened ?
 - ( groans )
 Mrs. Persky ...
 I need you to leave .
 Why ?
 I need to talk to my friend .
 What about ?
 It 's private .
 So sex , huh ?
 Just go !
 You seem irritable .
 ( quietly ) : Rob dumped me .
 He did ?
 Yeah , he sent roses with a note saying , " I can 't keep seeing you , please forgive me . "
 Oh , well , you knew this day was coming .
 I just thought he would be man enough to tell me to my face . Yeah .


 You know , I phoned him at his work yesterday ten times .
 His secretary , Claire , won 't put me through .
 Well , honey , it is time to move on .
 - You don 't want to embarrass yourself .
 - Well ...
 Yeah .
 ( sighs ) What are you doing back here ?
 I brought my husband .
 I want him to see how you talk to me .
 I should go .
 I 'll call you later .
 - Thanks .
 - Sorry ...
 Aw , why the long face ?
 Did your fella dump you ?
 Your wife is a horrible person .
 Do you know that ?
 Yeah , I 'm aware .
 I thought we were excited about the offer .
 ( sniffs )
 No , no .
 Look , of- of course I trust you .
 Yeah .
 I mean , do your thing .
 Okay .
 All right , bye . ( sniffs )
 Oh , shit .
 ( sniffs , clears throat )
 Is everything all right ?
 Hey .
 Uh , yes .
 Yeah , there 's- there 's an offer on the table for the script .
 But Lamar wants to hold out for more money , which , you know , makes me kind of nervous .
 ( sniffing )
 What are you on right now ?
 What ?
 Nothing .
 Oh , yeah ?
 Then what 's this , then ?
 ( sniffing ) Hmm ?
 It- it ... it 's a heavy pollen year .
 Dude ...
 It 's been on the news .
 We are on the same team .
 I cannot cover for you if you 're gonna be stupid about it .
 All right , I 'm sorry .
 The addy wasn 't cutting it for me anymore , so I just ...
 I needed something a little bit stronger .
 Why ?
 The script is done .
 TAYLOR : Guys ?
 ( sniffs ) Yeah , we 're in here .
 ( quietly ) : Get your hand out of your face .
 - All right .
 - Sorry .
 - Hey .
 - Hi .
 I need to talk to you both .
 - Yeah , what 's on your mind ? - Look ,
 I know I said I was okay with what went on with you two , but clearly , I wasn 't .
 I felt like I went away for the night , and you two had suddenly become this little team without me .
 And it 's not fair to blame you , because I 'm the reason we 're all together in the first place .
 I just feel like I talked you into this with absolutely no idea of how we would make it work .
 Well , that 's okay .
 - Yeah .
 I mean , we will figure it out .
 - We will .
 But we 're gonna need some help , and I think I found just the place to start .
 JADE : " Amour the Merrier Events , Limited " ? ELl :
 Events ?
 You want us to go to an orgy ?
 Oh , it 's not an orgy .
 It 's a polyamory retreat .
 Isn 't that just a fancy way of saying " orgy " ?
 Stop saying orgy .
 - This is a three- day event at a hotel in San Diego . - All right .

 - ( sniffs ) - They have workshops , lectures , all designed to help people who are new to the polyamorous lifestyle .
 - ( sniffs ) - The whole thing is designed by experts who know how to make a relationship

 - ( sniffs ) Oh , look , so here 's one of the seminars .
 " Negotiating Boundaries and Polyamorous
 Relationship Agreements . "
 - Doesn 't that sound helpful ?
 - Yeah , it really does . - Um , let me ... let me see . - See ?
 So , I 'll go make the reservations .
 - We 'll leave tomorrow . - All right .

 - Yeah , wonderful . - Yeah .
 - Yep .
 ( sniffling )
 You okay , babe ?
 Yeah , yeah , just , you know , allergies .
 Oof .
 It is a heavy pollen year .
 It was on the news .
 Huh .
 - ( yelps , laughs ) - ( laughing )
 Here comes the bubbly .
 Pour like there 's no tomorrow .
 You are getting your husband back .
 I 'm so happy .
 Of course , I feel bad for April .
 Why ?
 She should 've known what was coming .
 This is how the movie always ends : the man slinks back to his wife , and the whore ends up drunk and alone .

 Actually , now that I got four kids , it doesn 't sound so bad .
 ( chuckles softly )
 I was thinking of taking April to a restaurant next week .
 You know , to cheer her up .
 Beth Ann , the war is over .
 You won .
 Let the enemy limp away in defeat .
 April and I grew very close these last few weeks .
 It 's a true friendship .
 She thinks your name is Sheila .
 - I admit , it 's a complicated ...
 - ( car door closes )
 Honey !
 What 's wrong ?
 April is in my driveway .
 ( gasps ) Shit .
 ( quietly ) :
 What is she doing here ?
 Why the fuck should I know ?
 We can 't open the door .
 I think we 're gonna have to .
 I think she saw me .
 You have to be me .
 Are you crazy ?
 Please .
 I 'm begging .
 - Fine . - ( exhales )
 Christ on a cracker .
 Don 't swear .
 And be nice .
 ( doorbell rings )
 ( neutral accent ) : May I help you ?
 Are you Mrs. Robert Stanton ?
 Yes .
 And who might you be , pray tell ?
 I 'm April .
 I 'm ... a- a waitress at Jansen 's Diner in Glendale .
 Your husband is one of my regulars .
 Is he ?
 Yes .
 Um ...
 I don 't mean to rush you , dear , but I have curtains to hem and croutons in the oven .
 APRlL :
 Yes , I just wanted to come by to say that I think your husband might have left his coat at the diner .
 Well , mercy me .
 APRlL :
 ( chuckles ) I- I 'm not even sure if it 's his , but ... if you wouldn 't mind just telling him that I stopped by and asking him to call me .
 ( Brooklyn accent ) :
 He knows your number ... ( neutral accent ) : number ?
 At the diner .
 He could just give me a call at the diner .
 I 'll tell him .
 - Bye now . - Goodbye .

 I have never said " mercy me . "
 But you do bake your own croutons .
 I can 't believe April actually came to the house .
 Got to say , I 'm impressed .
 That tramp , she ain 't going down without a fight .
 Well , this tramp isn 't either .
 You know what I mean .
 I have to leave in ten minutes , and I have got absolutely no idea what to wear .
 You 're so cute , all aflutter over your dinner with your new beau .
 Is this pastel too gay ?
 Have you ever seen a straight pastel ?
 ( scoffs ) Will you please put the paper down and help me ?
 I 'm trying to find a nice place for you to live .
 Oh , what about a condo at Sanford Palms ?
 Sanford Palms ?
 That 's only about five blocks away from here .
 Well , I still want us to have our movie nights .
 You wouldn 't have to drive home after cocktails .
 Our friends are going to despise us .
 Why ?
 When people split up , they prefer venom and fireworks , tears and accusations .
 So childish and petty .
 - Besides , we did that last week . - Right .
 I 've narrowed it down to these two .
 Which do you prefer ?
 The linen .
 Are you sure ?
 Why do you care which suit ?
 How long is it gonna be on , really ?
 ( Cockney accent ) : Oi !
 I 'm a good girl , I am .
 I don 't let no gentleman touch me what ain 't bought me lobster first .
 - ( doorbell rings ) - ( laughs ) Oh , that 's Tommy .
 Don 't do Eliza for him .
 He won 't understand the reference , and he 'll think you 're having a stroke .
 Yes .
 Much humor is lost on the younger generation .
 Trousers !
 Tommy .
 Come in .
 Where 's Mr. Grove ?
 He has a date tonight .
 With a guy ?
 Yes .
 I 've lost a husband , but I 've gained a gay sidekick .
 I 'm glad .
 Because now ... we don 't have to hide when we do this .
 Mmm .
 ( hisses ) I 'm feeling something interesting .
 Can you blame me ?
 Not down there ... up here .
 Oh !
 Is this for me ?
 I was saving that for after dinner .
 Do you think you can wait ?
 What a question .
 Of course not .
 ( gasps )
 It 's stunning .
 Your taste is improving .
 Mm .
 A woman like you deserves the best .
 And I- I want you to see that I can give that to you .
 KARL : Tommy !
 He hasn 't left yet ?
 Thank God I caught you .
 I need fresh eyes on an outfit .
 Uh , Simone prefers the linen , but I think the navy 's more slimming .
 Thoughts ?
 Y- You 're not fat .
 Yes .
 As a straight man , I am boyishly slim .
 However , as a homo , I could afford to lose a few .
 So ...
 See what Tommy gave me .
 Ooh .
 Hark at you .
 Diamond Jim Brady Bunch .
 Anyway , which one ?
 Just pick one .
 Navy .
 Navy it is . Thank you .
 ( exhales ) I 'm terribly sorry to interrupt , but , as you know , it 's very important to get the costume right when you 're coming out .

 We don 't care if you come out , just as long as you get out .
 I can always take a subtle hint , Simone .
 Perhaps , one day , you 'll give me one .
 Oh , tell Hector you won 't sleep with him unless he does my hair for the wedding !
 You got it !
 Goodbye !
 You have a very interesting marriage .
 Sheila .
 Um , what are you doing here ?
 Our visit was cut short yesterday , so I just ...
 Now 's not really a good time ; I 'm feeling under the weather .
 Do you want me to run to the drugstore for you ?
 Oh , no , no .
 I just ... need a couple of aspirin .
 Sit .
 I 'll get them for you .
 Oh , you don 't have to do that .
 It 's no trouble .
 Besides , I have some good news .
 Oh .
 That 's nice .
 I could use some .
 I 've found you a man .
 His name 's Eldon Ratzinger .
 Eldon Ratzinger .
 He 's my butcher . Very nice .
 On the short side , but you wouldn 't notice if you 're wearing flats .
 Thanks , but ...
 I can 't meet anyone for a while .
 You won 't forget about Rob if you sit around pouting .
 Trust me , I won 't be forgetting about Rob anytime soon .

 At least we know why April was so desperate to speak to Rob .
 How do you think he 'll react ?
 I think he will be thrilled .
 Really ?
 Rob loved being a father .
 When we lost Emily ... that was our daughter 's name ...
 That 's a beautiful name .
 When we lost Emily , he couldn 't accept it .
 Rob begged me to have another child .
 Why didn 't you ?
 We tried and tried , but ...
 Did you ever think about adoption ?
 Rob said he didn 't want to raise another man 's baby .
 He wanted a child of his own .
 ( inhales )
 And now he 's going to get one .
 God , I hate this guy .
 Ugh , please , he 's still my husband .
 What do I do now ?
 Come clean .
 Tell him you know about the affair , and the baby .
 - No . - It 's time to put it all on the table .
 But how will that help ?
 It will force him to make a choice .
 You or her .
 What if ... he doesn 't choose me ?
 Well , then you 'll finally hate the fucking bastard just as much as I do .
 No , I won 't .
 That 's the problem .
 Look , I don 't know what he 's gonna do .
 Maybe he 'll choose you .
 But whatever happens , aren 't you done with all the lies ?

 Why didn 't you tell me these diamonds were real ?
 Yea ... of course they 're real .
 I thought you knew that .
 Well , I didn 't .
 Take this back .
 No .
 Why would I do that ?
 The bank told your mother you sold a bond .
 She now thinks you 're on drugs , and knowing what you spent on this , I 'm wondering if she 's right .
 - I 'm not taking it back .
 - Tommy .
 I should be able to buy diamonds for the woman I love .
 Relax .
 I don 't expect you to say it back .
 I gave you that so you 'd see that I 'm not just some kid who can 't play in your league .
 The diamonds are real because my feelings are .
 You know I adore you , but I just don 't see how we can have that kind of relationship .
 Because of what people would say ?
 - They 'd be brutal .
 - So , you 're not embarrassed that Karl dates men , but you are embarrassed by me ?
 I am not embarrassed at all .
 - ( footsteps approaching ) - ( gasps ) Oh , dear God .
 Hey , Tommy !
 Who 's your girlfriend ?
 I- I can 't stay here .

 No .
 It 's yours .
 I 'm not ashamed to love you .
 - Taylor ... - Don 't .
 I need for no one to speak right now .
 How long ?
 Sorry ?
 How long have you been using again ?
 Not that long .
 - I mean , it started ... - Don 't tell me .
 I don 't want to know how long I missed the signs .
 How long this has been happening right in front of my own stupid face .

 You ... shut up .

 Hello ?
 Tommy 's dealing drugs .
 What ?
 Kay Randall 's son Bradley saw him today with a customer .
 A customer ?
 He saw him making a deal in the middle of P. E. with some seedy , middle- aged woman
 - in dark glasses .
 - Middle- aged ?
 Anyway , do you have a screwdriver ?
 I want to break into Tommy 's room .
 Why ?
 I 'm sure he doesn 't keep drugs in there .
 Maybe not , but at least I could read his journal .
 His journal ?
 I think I found one .
 W- Well , what do you mean , he keeps a journal ?
 I- I have to go .
 - Naomi . Uh ...
 - ( dial tone )

 - Naomi ?
 - NAOMl :
 Up here !
 ( grunts )
 Naomi .
 I 'm so glad you 're here .
 You can help me look .
 I am only here to stop you from making an awful mistake .
 If Tommy finds out you read his journal , you could lose him forever .
 He won 't find out .
 He 's at track until 6 : 00 .
 You trashed his room .
 You won 't have time to clean it up .
 And the journal may not even be here .
 - Found it .
 - ( gasps )
 Simone .
 When Amy was ten , I read her diary .
 She didn 't speak to me for a year .
 - Hand it over . - If she had been Tommy 's age , she 'd have moved out .

 Do you really want to risk that , just to get an intrusive look at Tommy 's most private thoughts and ...
 - Jesus Christ .
 Nothing !
 - What ?
 - Give me that .
 - ( gasps )
 As your friend , I am begging you , don 't read that .
 Why are you so emotional ?
 Karl is gay .
 - What ? - He sleeps with men .
 Uh ... can we just focus on my problems for a moment ?
 No wonder you 're so distraught .
 I mean , I wanted to tell you , but then I thought , " No , Naomi has her own problems .
 She doesn 't want to hear my tawdry tale . "
 Oh , but I do .
 that when I saw Karl 's car at the motel , he was there with a man ?
 NAOMl :
 I can 't talk about this without a drink .
 Maybe we could go downstairs and , you know , open up a bottle ?
 Of course . But how did you find out ?
 Did you catch him with one of his lovers ?
 SlMONE :
 No , it was Wanda . You were right .
 She despises me .
 - She found out ... - What are you doing in my room ?
 Is that my journal ?
 Uh , she just found it , but she hasn 't read it yet .
 I 'm so sorry , Tommy .
 I just wanted to make sure that you weren 't doing drugs .
 So you broke into my room ?
 Well , you 've been so distant lately .
 Mrs. Grove , if you wouldn 't mind ...
 Yes , I should go , as this doesn 't involve me at all .
 Jesus .
 Mom ...
 ( scoffs )
 You looking for these ?
 Oh , good , you found them .
 Thank you .
 How 'd it go in there ?
 Eh , just told Mom that I 'm gonna cash in another bond so I can hike through Europe this summer .
 She felt so guilty about breaking into my room that she agreed .
 You turned the situation to your advantage .
 Good for you .
 I , uh , leave for Paris two days after graduation .
 Care to join me ?
 Are you crazy ?
 We don 't have to leave at the same time .
 I 'll go first , then you take a vacation and meet me there .
 No one 's gonna know that we 're together .
 Your mother 's watching .
 That is why we need to do this .
 Someone is watching us here .
 We will never know who we can be as a couple until we get away from my mom , your friends , and everyone else whose opinions you 're scared of .
 Can I think about it ?
 Sure .
 ( exhales )
 Wow .
 Look at this .
 Someone went to a lot of trouble .
 Oh , not so much .
 I just put out a few flowers , and the good silver , and the candlesticks your mother bought us .
 Would you like a mai tai before dinner ?
 You made mai tais ? ( chuckles )
 Hold it .
 Did you wreck the car ?
 Why would you think that ?
 You only make mai tais before giving me bad news .
 - That 's silly .
 - Huh .
 Now drink your mai tai .

 Where do you think you 're going ?
 Upstairs .
 Not alone , you 're not .
 In fact , this is what 's gonna happen right now .
 You and I are gonna take a tour of this house , and you 're gonna show me where you 've been hiding your stash .
 - There 's no stash . I just ...
 - And you know what , Eli , put all that shit down , because you have absolutely no reason to unpack .
 You 're going to rehab first thing in the morning .
 Are you kidding ? Rehab ?
 Come on .
 I want your wallet .
 And your phone .
 You are cut off .
 No cash , no cards , no PayPal , no Venmo .
 Do you understand ?
 You know , I understand why you 're upset , but you don 't have to humiliate me
 - in front of Jade , too .
 - Wrong .
 You should be humiliated .
 After what we went through last time , the idea that you would even put us through this again ... ( phone ringing )
 - Eli , give it to me .
 - It 's Lamar .
 - He 'll leave a message .
 - Just ...
 It could be about the script .
 Just ... please let me take the call .
 - ( ringing continues ) - Fine .
 Stay where I can see you .
 Hey .
 - Yeah ...
 - Tay ...
 I want to help .
 Just tell me what I can do .
 ELl :
 How much ?
 - Just ... be with me . - ELl :
 Yeah .
 Back me up .
 This is gonna be really hard .
 But it 's the only way .
 Hey , you got it .
 Of course .
 ELl : Yeah .
 Yeah .
 Okay .
 ( phone beeps )
 What did Lamar say ?
 He- he was able to start a bidding war ... ... and he sold it for a lot more than we expected .
 How much more ?
 One- point- two .
 - One- point- two ?
 - Million .
 ( chuckling ) : 1 . 2 million .
 - Holy shit . - Yeah .
 Oh , my God .
 JADE : Oh , my God !
 - ( chuckling ) - Are you serious ?
 Oh , my God . - Eli , congratulations .
 - Oh , my God , thank you . Thank you .
 - Oh , my God .
 - Yes ! Honey , this is such great news , okay ?
 Your career is back again .
 This is all the more reason to get you to rehab .
 ( chuckling ) :
 You- you know what ?
 I- I don 't , I don 't think it 's the best time for me , right now .
 Buddy ... you don 't really have a choice here .
 I just sold a script for $1 . 2 million .
 You know ?
 I think I got a lot of fucking choices .
 Eli ...
 I am not gonna stand by and watch you kill yourself .
 Oh , God .
 Come on .
 This is not like last time , all right ?
 - I 'm in a completely better place now . - Eli !
 This is nonnegotiable .
 - Taylor ... - Do you know what ... ?
 You 're so fucking desperate to control me , aren 't you ?
 - I mean , it 's fucking pathetic ! - Okay .
 No , Eli ,
 - this is the drugs talking .
 You know that , right ?
 - No .
 No .
 No , it 's not .
 This is me , okay ?
 I am clear as a fucking bell right now .
 And from now on ...
 I make my own decisions .
 Okay , Eli .
 Well , here 's one for you : either you go to rehab , or I walk out that fucking door !
 - Whoa . Hold on . Hold on .
 - Really ?
 - Yeah . Oh , yeah .
 - Really ?
 You just walk on out ?
 - If you push me , yeah . - Okay .
 Well , Taylor , you know , I really wish you wouldn 't go .
 But if you want to , that 's your choice .
 See ?
 I would never force you to do anything .
 Come on , Jade .
 Jade ...
 I ... I think maybe we shouldn 't go .
 - You what ?
 - Eli needs help .
 I think maybe the best way to help him is to stay here and- and , you know , just keep an eye on him .
 You 're choosing him .
 I 'm choosing us .
 I 'm choosing all of us .
 Fuck you .
 Fuck you both .
 ROB :
 Mmm .
 ( chuckles )
 I can 't believe you made peach cobbler .
 - I know it 's your favorite .
 - Mmm .
 You must 've been cooking since noon .
 I didn 't start all that early .
 Well , thanks for this .
 It was a beautiful night .
 You 're welcome .
 Aw , geez .
 I knew it .
 Something 's going on .
 ( exhales ) Robert ?
 And you 're calling me Robert ?
 Ah , this is gonna be bad , huh ?
 We definitely need to have a talk .
 Ah , boy .
 First ...
 I just want to say ... ... I love you so much .
 - Mm .
 - And more importantly ,
 I love us .
 And the life we 've had .
 You 're starting to scare me .
 I 'm scared , too .
 What 's going on ?
 What 's wrong ?
 Just tell me .
 Once I tell you ... ... everything is going to be different .
 Oh , my God .

 Yes .

 How many men do you think I 'm juggling ?
 Oh , glad one of us is having a good day .

 I cannot tell you what I 've been through today .
 I 'm guessing you 'll try .
 You know the pin Tommy gave me ?
 Well , it turns out the diamonds were real .
 Naomi was furious , because he cashed in one of his savings bonds to buy it .
 Anyway , she decided he was on drugs .
 ( fading ) : And that she had to read his journal ...
 DOCTOR :


 KARL :


 DOCTOR :
 I am just relieved that Naomi didn 't find out .
 Anyway ... ( sighs ) before I left , Tommy ran out , and said something that I definitely need to talk to you about .
 Oh , dear .
 Am I going to need more wine ...
 Oh !
 Damn it !
 ( gasps ) - Oh , is it bad ?
 Let me see ... - No !
 No , no .
 No , no , sorry .
 Um , uh , it- it 's not deep .
 Um ...
 Can you just get me a Band- Aid ?
 Of course .
 Uh , uh , so , uh , what did Tommy say ?
 Well , he 's going to Europe for the summer , and he wants me to join him .
 Oh .
 I know it sounds crazy , but I thought it might be nice to spend time with him ... and not have to sneak around .
 What do you think ?
 You should go .
 Really ?
 I mean , it 's a hectic time , with Amy 's wedding ,
 - and the gallery ... - Listen ,
 listen .
 I have spent my entire life putting off things that I thought there 'd be time for later .
 Open doors don 't stay open forever .
 So please ... go .
 You 'll be okay ?
 I 'll be delightful .
 ( chuckles ) I 'll bet .
 Judging from those flowers , Hector must be smitten . - Yes .
