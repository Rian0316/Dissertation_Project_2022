I am serving my sentence at home and this is a condition of my bail
investigation begins
I want you to investigate a person 's background
Boundaries are broken
You won 't regret taking this 'trip' with me about the news
Peterson let me into his office this morning SOPETERSONCALLEDMEINT OHISOFFICETODAY . From the bad news
He changed his mind and he left this promotion to DUGGAN and it turned out to be bad news

I 'm pregnant, the baby could be yours
E die B ritt 's favorite moment of the day is coming to the construction site of her new home because she knows what to expect
Her sudden appearance always brings an admiring glance and an insatiable look
unbridled gaze
For E die, it 's sad that the man she wants to attract the most attention doesn 't care about her
That 's right E die needs attention to make herself feel better so she made a decision
Miss BRITT, you are extra pretty today
C yrus , your mouth is so sweet
Anyway, I-- I think it 's not
maybe i can invite you to dinner
Dear
You 've been out of the league for a long time, this project is not your usual play
Hello
E die, what 's the matter?
It looks so handsome. Are you busy?
not busy
Great, I bought a few freshly fried bagels
food for construction workers
You see, I bought too much
I thought maybe you and I could
S u s a n
Hey, E die you guys- -
How do you--
Mike and I are reconciled
amazing
I know you 'll be happy for us, is there anything?
E die is thinking about . . .
Would you like some free bagels?
very good, thank you
You put them on the counter, okay?
leave me a candy
I can 't believe you 're still looking for him
You said you two blew
You thought he was a murderer
That 's why you came to flirt?
you wasted your time and your bagels
It 's not a waste if you choke
Thanks, E die bagels look tempting
I am honored to meet

I 'll go home and get some milk to go with those bagels
look
It 's not good to run around like this
I can 't use juice with the bagels how awkward it is
I mean
we should live together
what do you say
I, I think, ah
Wait a minute E die !
E die ! Park !
Pause !
What 's the matter now? I was just so unreasonable
Looking straight at you, I apologize to you
Thank you, Susan, it 's not easy for you to apologize
Talking about a completely unrelated topic, I moved in with Mike
goodbye
Yes, E die B ritt needs a man 's attention to feel better
C y r u s
Do you have any plans for lunch?
no
She herself can 't believe that she wants to find a man so much

Finally leaving Wisteria Lane
Last year, this street where they lived
Became a paradise for arsonists, violent men, smashers, blackmailers and murderers
They 're afraid they 're going to get caught up in this moral turmoil, and the Mullins feel like it 's time to move out
Strangely, none of their neighbors noticed they moved
Hey
I think you might be thirsty
I 'm very good
How is your roommate?
not so much
I have to tell him - - it might upset him
- Just kidding - what did you say?
how can you tell john
He 's simply not good enough to have a child
- the child could be his - the situation is complicated
It seems simple to me
you cold blooded bitch
Why do you want to hit a weeder?
If you saw him do something to our begonia you would slap him too
That 's all I don 't know
I have no idea
Hey
Lynette, what are you doing here, what is this?
You told me that Duggan came back to work today
I think I 'm going to do something for him
Definitely not here to spy on me and Annabel
- What? - Yesterday you brought pictures of the children
The day before yesterday, you brought me soap
Lynette , dear . . . can 't do this anymore
TOM . . . I don 't mind you working with Annabel
I told you
This is for Duggan, he just had a heart attack
I don 't mind Annabel at all
L Y N E T T E .
Speaking of the devil
i mean that
You 're almost a permanent representative here. Right?
I just want to do something for Duggan
I guess stuffing his veins with fat would be a good idea
This is fructose, do you want me to cut you?
cut you a piece
Everyone, please come over
Listen, I just met Duggan 's wife
It doesn 't look like he 's coming back to work
His heart attack came back last night, which makes us a little bit more nervous.
Our team must come together to do our job
J erry , you will be the form accounting
Suzanne , you do the Ferrari Spring Collection Annabel I want you to be in charge of the travel hotel chain
You leave for Hawaii in three days
I can 't travel alone
I can 't go alone when things are still undecided
choose someone to go with you
OK
I choose . . .
T o m
look
You lose at mahjong
This is your last chance to turn around
don 't talk. you 're making me laugh
i will be nice
lose, lose, lose
BREE . Well, I don 't need to distract you
It 's time to hit your perfect shot
I am not ready yet
Come on, there 's a lot of people waiting. It 'll be ready soon
hurry up
do your best - don 't do that
G eorge. . .
Are you excited?
sorry how could it be . . .
you blow in my ear
- I 'm just teasing you - because of this
Hurry up and get it done. There are kids here
How to get it done?
I don 't know how to think about unpleasant things like ?
famine, disease, wandering
whatever you want, hurry up
you can 't be mad at me
man can 't control
I want our friendship to continue is that I think R ex guesses out of thin air so hate you but you always have feelings for me
simply betrayal
don 't do that, Bree
The only thing I feel guilty about is loving you silently
you shouldn 't
I have to remind you that I 'm married
You are married to a two-faced man and he convicted you of going to a prostitute
I believe you just told you
How can you tell me this kind of thing?
you want to end our friendship
I did so much for you
what do you mean ?
fine
no meaning George
i love you friend
I wish you could love me the same way but since you can 't . . .
goodbye
E die B rit saw something that upset her that afternoon
She wants to stop this
Is Susan coming?
She said she might be a little later
She 's moving Mike 's stuff to her house
Already moved? Great
Yes, nice to see Susan happy again
I am also very happy for Susan
But don 't you think she 's progressing a little faster with Mike?
Two days ago, she thought he was a murderer and now she wants to live with him?
She knew he was fighting back in self-defense
I think they 've got it all figured out and they 're right
Mike is a nice man
Yes
he was shot
Right. Did he explain?
No. I understand guns
His wounds were definitely not his own.
And Mrs Huber 's bloody jewelry?
It won 't walk into Mike 's garage by itself
maybe something is wrong
If there 's one thing I 've learned, it 's that men can 't be trusted
That 's right
You mean we should stop them ?
Let her sit down and discuss it will be okay to tell her our concerns
we can do
That 's right
E die , do you want to get involved?
Usually I don 't participate
But if there is any way I can help Susan . . .
we need to talk
OK
I found a box of bullets while I was tidying up in your bedroom

I 'm really sorry for D ierdre you must be wondering who killed her
But if we 're going to live together we can 't let this get between us
We must get rid of these, get rid of all
document, map, gun
Guns in particular. I 'll leave that to the police.
They are very professional
what can I say ?
your request is reasonable
Really? So easy?
Maybe after lunch we can discuss your leather chair
'I know I treat you badly
I 'm the one who needs help, not you
So I 'm leaving for a while, MRS.
Mrs Tilman will take care of you'
You are not a burden in my house. I welcome you
'I left you something
I hope you find comfort in this
I got you a new pair of gloves
You can bring it to play ball when I 'm not around 'I love you. Dad word'

I don 't understand why he didn 't come to see me?
Why run away?
Your father is in big trouble, dear
I 'm sure he did what he thought was best for you
He wants me to take comfort from this pile of rubbish ?
I hate baseball! He should know!
Z a c h
Susan is here
It 's not always good to interfere in other people 's affairs
Be cruel, she might cry
Good morning
I didn 't know cooking class became a group activity
The more people the better, isn 't it?
As long as no one laughs at my wrinkled clothes
Why am I the only one wearing an apron?
Looks like we 're collectively targeting you
But you 're moving so fast, we think there 's a little... we should intervene
you might be sad
we don 't want to do that either
I really appreciate your efforts, really
but i won 't change my mind
Many people have hurt me in my life
Karl and . . .
I 've grown disgusted with reality waiting for people to do the worst to me
I don 't want to live like that anymore
When Mike let me live with him . . .
I am very happy
Silly only know happy I am happy now
I wish I could always be like this
i love him i love him
I expect Mike to give me the best feeling
I know he will do the same
Dear .. ..
so perfect
I 've never been so unsuccessful trying to intervene in other people 's family affairs
It 's been a long time since we ate together
It 's been so long since we last had lunch
I 'm so glad to see you I 'm so glad to see you I have an idea
Actually I have an idea
I met a guy last week who I met you guys last week said you 're hiring
He said you are hiring
Yes ?
is that true ?
Yes Yes
Have you ever thought about going back to work?
Do you want to start working again?
As long as you want to come back, I 'll--
In fact--
not me no no no not me
I 'm thinking of Tom I 'm helping Tom plan .
T o m
Oh .
T O M .
He 's been thinking about changing jobs, he 's been thinking about moving.
He thinks he feels a little bit that in this position, he has nothing to do
In his current position, he has done everything in his power
what
Tom is very reliable Well, TOM is very reliable
Not only is he reliable, he is not only reliable
And the idea is superior
TOM 's idea is awesome
He is passionate about his work He is passionate about his work
His intuition is not limited to books
Predictable.
Is he as good as you? Is he as good as you?
Like he 's an apple and I 'm an orange
He 's different from me, we 're good at different areas
We all have our strengths
trust me - - you should meet him trust me - - you should meet him
I don 't need apples I don 't want his kind
I need someone like you I need someone like you
Sharp and ruthless
ruthless
Show no mercy
gosh, N at
God, you said I was almost like a shark, you said I was like a great white shark
AH. Oh well
OK .
In fact look, in fact if you want that kind of supervisor... .
If you 're looking for that type of . . .
Do you have this kind of shark in there? Can you get me a great white shark?
Yes
Yes
very nice shark
A beautiful great white shark
i think so my idea is
I 'm going to see if Morrison is in the clinic I 'll ask Dr. Morrison from the LIPSTONE clinic to see if he can come and consult
come for a consultation
You let someone in? You still need a consultation?
Your body doesn 't respond to the medication Your body should respond to our medication
didn 't react as it should
All the tests we did came back 'null' and all the tests we did came back negative, so I--
So I- -
I 'm just to be on the safe side
want to be on the safe side
Excuse me
please forgive
i want to make a call
i have to call back
I don 't know why I don 't know why but I have a strong feeling
an irresistible premonition
You 'll be fine, really you 'll be fine. I really think so
Lee C raig simply has the greatest self esteem LEECRAIG is the most arrogant doctor I have ever seen
If he wants to consult someone If he wants to consult someone it means he has no choice . . .
It just proves he can 't handle it . . .
That means I 'm done It means I 'm done Don 't say that
Don 't say that damn Bree fuck it, BREE,
Do you understand what happened?
Do you understand what 's going on here?
i might die
i might die
I might die too, and so will I
what ?
what ?
I could be hit by a car tomorrow when I was crossing the street I could be hit by a car when I was crossing the street tomorrow
What are you trying to say? You mean everything is God 's claim?
What I 'm trying to say is what I 'm trying to say we 're all gonna die in the end
is that we will eventually die one day
In the days we live whatever we have left may be 2 days or 20 years
Two days, or twenty years
We should all be kind to each other
I think we should both treat the other side well
you are right
you 're right
Ms. Tilman
Paul Young has been missing for two days have you seen him
why ask me?
I saw him leave a box in front of your door and I saw Zack here too
Even if I know where Mr. Young went why should I tell you
Look . . . . . .
The police think I killed your sister I know you must think so too
But I swear to you, I have nothing to do with this
And you think Paul Young did it
no, i didn 't say that
You gotta admit, it 's a clever idea
Want a snack?
It 's no exaggeration to assume that Paul killed Martha to avenge his wife 's death
Because Martha blackmailed them
But maybe I 'm the only one who thinks so
no
you are so considerate
Want tea?
thanks
Do these diaries mention why your sister is blackmailing the Young family?
not very clear
but i understand
It 's about a murder
And now you 're saying your friend was murdered
Why didn 't you hand this over to the police?
Do you agree with the death penalty?
Well . . . agree
I too have the death penalty in Utah
But the state does not
it 's a pity
Do you agree?
I agree
I really like you, Mr. Delfino
Do you know where Paul Young went?
I 'm afraid I don 't know
But I know where he 'll be on Thursday night
That afternoon, after looking for her letter
Gabrielle is surprised to discover the truth behind her pregnancy
very shocked
Baby, do you want to go online and watch the homeless?
What 's wrong?
I want to say goodbye to you because I 'm leaving you
What?
Look, our health insurance sent a letter and someone prepaid me for a year of birth control pills
But we don 't want thousands of contraceptive pills
I told you it was my mother
This is signed and dated, CARLOS ,
Juanita was still in a coma when filling out the form
You did it, not your mother
To be a man, be brave
your mom can do it
Gabrielle , don 't go
Ahhh, have you forgotten I 'm pregnant, you savage
Where are you going
Leave
i 'm going to jail
I 'm leaving tomorrow
I know, so I just packed one bag
What about the baby, Gabrielle?
what to do with my baby
oh your baby?
ok - - our baby
We are a family now
Baby needs his mom and his dad
oh carlos
Who said you were his father?
Hello
Hello
Hey
What are you doing TMD?
Damn criminals!
Attention to all units, license plate number D - 1 6 3 0 ,
Suspect should have been under house arrest
Now heading west towards Parker Doulevd
This is a group of 14. We hit the road
Looks like we have a fugitive going.

Is John there?
If I say no, are you going to slap me again?
He went to work, what happened?
i just left my husband
Wait a moment
Do you think you can fuck my wife by helping me mow the lawn?
stop!
Hey!
stand up !
Hey .
what happened ?
Oh Tom, I just had my craziest day
This morning, people from Mitchellland Kerns called me and they wanted to poach me.
are you going?
I told Peterson about this
He promoted me. He made me VP
Vice President of what?
Tom - - Company 's
He gave me Duggan 's old post. How crazy
i have to go tell scotty . see you later

Tom , I was looking for you
What the hell is going on, D an ?
what 's the problem?
You made Annabel my boss?
someone dig her
I can 't lose her now
Well, guess what? - - you lost me
because i quit
Tom , don 't overreact
No, the first time you ignored me
I took it like a good soldier
But I 've been taking the job for Duggan since he got the Heart Soldier
I 've been doing his work, and you 've just handed it to Annabel now?
OK, you made it very clear
no, you 're making bad decisions every day, D an ,
I have to get my hands on it, but this time-- this time is the dumbest
hey, be careful
You 've hit rock bottom since you came
I see it very well, Scavo,
Why did you give up my promotion to Annabel?
Why do you have to sniff at her?
because Lynette
what? she went to my wife
beg her not to let me promote you
She said if you travel more it will damage your family
Did she do this?
I 'm in trouble
I think this is another crappy decision I 'm going to make
clear your table before tonight
Can you tell us now why you attacked this child?
This is between me and him -- and my wife
Is that right? - - You are having an affair with his wife?
no
I 'm gay are you gay?
what? !
I 'm gay
Nope, gay again
What is 'again'?
i want a lawyer
George what are you doing

Obviously, buy something
what are you buying here
you live on the other side of the city
My friend had surgery and I helped him buy something
Oh
you are nice
Wait, BREE.
I have to tell you something
Yep?
You have to tell Rex to be careful when discussing your  'love life '
What?
I don 't want to say more
you really have to tell him
Wait a moment
What the hell are you talking about I 'm in the hospital
I was visiting my friend who had surgery and heard two doctors talking about R ex about
sex preferences
Did you hear that?
Apparently, he told them he had a box of . . . 'tools' and also let you . .
do something very inappropriate
I see
Bree , obviously it 's none of my business and I 'll never really mention it but to hear two men make fun of you like that . . .
I think you should know
thank you for telling me
But I thought, I gotta go
I found some more boxes
When I ask you anything recently, you answer like this
What do you want us to have for dinner?
I can not go
I got an emergency call--
Main water main is broken
I help you warm
Oh, I don 't think I can go home for dinner
I didn 't say dinner
Do you need help?
No, I can
Yep
I can
If you have an emergency, is it time to go now?
There 's already someone
I 'm just a post-maintenance person
Then I go back to work
mom
Do you really want to follow him?
You just swore to your friend that you trust him YOUJUSTMADESUCHAHUGED EALTOYOURFRIENDS
But then I found Mrs Huber 's diary in his car
What did you write?
The point is not what was written
The point is that he knows it all
I don 't know what he 's doing, but it must not be repairing sewers. I 'm going to see what he 's doing now.
mom
If you don 't trust him, why live with him?
I don 't have time to explain to you about the adults
Climb down
you lost
6 cars in between
We go back a little and he can 't see us
But then we won 't be able to see him either.
Honestly, Mom, you 're not good at this
Yeah? I remember when your dad cheated on me
I follow him all day
I have this ability
he 's in front
What is Mike doing?
Who is he hugging?
I don 't know, I 'll go over and ask
don 't move
close the door
What exactly do you want to do? oh my god




goodbye
Is she your wife?
If that 's my wife, can I still be with you?
Isn 't it Mike?
no
not him
They charged you with hate crimes?
Do you remember the guy who repaired the TV was beaten up?
i did
I thought you had an affair with him
I 'm gay with the guy who fixes the TV?
who knew he was gay
And Justin is gay too
Now the police think I 'm abusing gays
is a bit
it 's all your fault
You made me mistakenly think you were having an affair for revenge
It 's obvious
you 're gonna lie to me now
You go tell those cops that you 're having an affair, I want to teach him a lesson, wrong person
wrong 2 times
I won 't lie for you, Carlos
Gabby, if this case gets on me, I 'm going to be in jail for 8 years
Do you want to persuade me with this?
I can 't take it easy for 18 years because you 've done your hands and feet on the contraceptive pill
G abby don 't do that to me
G a b b y
don 't go
G a b b y !
Anyway, next time I won 't ask my daughter to watch my boyfriend together
I made a mistake this time
Darling, don 't ignore me
I do not have it
You said you 've seen it?
Look a bit. why ?
Mrs. Huber blackmailed Zach 's mother
Z a c h ?
what are you doing ?
Can 't sleep, so just... sit up and think about things

What are you thinking?
Do you really want to know?
B r e e . .
I 'm not particularly in the mood to guess right now, just tell me
What happened ?
I 'm thinking the biggest mistake of my life was promising to marry you
i guess
am i doing something wrong
I have to endure all the horrible things you 've done in the past and it 's not the worst
Are you going to tell your colleagues about the humiliation I suffered?
what ?
R ex , everyone is talking about our sex life
Everyone 's talking about every dirty thing in that locker you put in the closet
Bree, I swear to god I never told anyone
- You lied to me - who told you this?
unimportant
It 's important because I 've never told anyone
Is that right? How did anyone else know that?
Since it 's definitely not what I said . . .
Why should I tell anyone about our bed?
how could I know .
R ex , maybe you use it to show off to others
Or you subconsciously want to make me sad
Congratulations. I 'm really sad
My image is completely broken
- I didn 't say anything! - I don 't believe you

R e x ?
What 's up ?
I have a heart attack again
impossible
Bree , take me to the hospital
ok you go downstairs first
I 'm going down right now
dad ?
what are you doing ?
i 'm waiting for your mom . . . take me to the emergency room
What 's up ?
I have a heart attack again
My God, where is she?
I do not know either
Dad said he had another heart attack
I know. I 'll take him to the hospital right away
when ?
I 'll go when I make the bed
what ?
How can I go out if the bed is not made?
it 's not that you don 't know
But hurry up and take Dad to the hospital.
ok. now can go
nothing lasts forever
There will always be a day to say goodbye to the world we are familiar with
Say goodbye to what we 've always had
Say goodbye to those who have always been with us
When this moment really comes, the friends around me leave one after another and new faces appear one after another
We can only say hello and welcome
