Screw you


Any news from Mark?
I don 't know, I didn 't pay attention at all, I don 't . . .

I 'm not idle
Good day to you, Miss Mitchell
OK, so are you

Damn it, Gusmin, you are amazing
So your job is to write book reviews You live in a building with a concierge
Yes, my family lived there for many years
So the rent is still stuck in the 1980s and I read really fast
How many books can you read in a week?
sometimes a day
- what? - real

So do you know a lot?
No
just know a lot
Simply Action Wikipedia
Yeah, it would be great if I could read one book a year.
Feel sorry
yeah, but... you 're a handsome guy

You can 't have both, right?
smart and handsome

Life is not a fairy tale

thank you for taking me home

You are welcome
I like
- Yes? - Yes

So now is the time to ask 'your house is mine'?
What 's wrong?
How about this
my home
- Really? - real
whatever


- Good night, Gusmin - Miss Mitchell, good night
Good night



Ted

Ted
Ted?
hateful!
Goodman, early
- How are you? - morning
To be a monk for a day and ring the bell for a day?
Yes
Would it be better to have a cup of tea?

You 're back with bread and croissants
You handsome british bastard!



good morning darling, i 'm going out to buy breakfast
yeah, ok, come on



'Good morning, dear'
- Can 't you come in, honey? - I do not like him
- what? - Little Ted
- You 've only met for 30 seconds - 30 seconds is too long for me
Listen, he 's super perfect, okay?
Maybe it 's because of culture. Your standards for looking at people are too strict.
Gusmin, stop denying the people I brought home, okay?
This guy has no brain
You are a smart woman with a Ph.D.
I 'm doing this for you
Please, give him a chance, okay?
He 's polite and he 's... he 's sexy and has a great bedtime

And he 's at my house now

- Croissant? - Did my vision miss it?
Okay, this is so weird, someone else is here
- Who are you talking to? - no one, break
- Hi Ted, good morning - Hi

- Was that Goodming just now? - Gusmin
- Yes, the guard - the porter
Yeah, others don 't seem too bad
We just had a nice chat downstairs
he 's super friendly

Right? Did you have a good time talking?
- yeah- ok
Why is there no news from Ted? I don 't have time to meet, I 'm so busy, thank you, thank you


- Good night, Miss Mitchell - Hi, Gusmin
Are you OK?
satisfied
What book did you read today?
tell me what 's fun
OK
Do you know how the idiom 'a flash in the pan' came from?
Gold diggers see the reflection of fake gold in the sieve
Or muskets that reflect light but don 't fire bullets, right?
Yes, that 's it, you 're right
I didn 't know
You look different. Changed your hairstyle?
No, why is it different?
where have you changed
Yeah, maybe a little sad
Why are you a little sad?
Is Mr. Ted coming over tonight?
Actually, we split
I regret that
Say he 's a flash in the pan
yes, that 's right

Your intuition is so accurate, Gusmin, it 's amazing
Where I come, people will learn to see people
If you could bottle that skill and sell it to young girls in America, you wouldn 't have to be a concierge anymore.
I 'm happy as a concierge
I don 't . . . I 'm hugging. . . I 'm not that. . .
- I 'm sorry - it 's okay
- Good night

September

Miss Mitchell?
Need something?
no thanks
I suddenly have a headache and the aspirin is gone, I 'll go to the opposite side
I have pain, I 'll look for it
I have a migraine, yes

So I still need to eat something to make my stomach feel good
Jiaweiscon?
be right back



6 5 and a half, want a bag?

good luck
Good night


my favourite
mom- mom-sister- mom
Dad- Ted- Granny



All right. . .
it will be pass away

I can 't have a baby with a man I don 't love or trust
child needs parents
A child needs a father and mother

What kind of nonsense is this?
Of course I didn 't mean that
I mean, like my upbringing
have my parents
gosh my parents
God, what would they say?

Baby girl came to New York and got pregnant less than a year ago or with a man she didn 't plan to settle down with
They were looking forward to his
Thought he was like Hugh Grant, but now he 's...
like Hugh Grant
Who cares what your parents say? or what do they think?
There is a clinic four blocks away
I can . . . this thing can end
Of course
No one will criticize you, do what you want
But don 't do it out of fear
You are responsible for your own life
I can 't do it by myself
A village raises a child
New York is a big village
go get some sleep
Tomorrow is another unknown day

You 've been going to great lengths to protect me from bad men and now it seems like you 're encouraging me to live alone

you 're not alone anymore


- hi, hi- hi
- sorry, i 'm late - no, that 's ok
- hello- hi

thank you for coming to see me
I 'm from England, the center of civilization
We can totally continue to meet
- You look so good - thank you
what are you?
Baby
That new trendy mocktail? gosh
- I 'd better drink iced tea - yeah
you might need a stronger glass
Hey, what would you like to drink?
- Alcoholic - wait a minute
OK
So . . . that . . .
I. . .


Are you ok? take a deep breath

You can participate as much as you want in this
no one is holding you accountable
I 'll respect your decision no matter what but I . . . I 've decided I 'm going to have this baby
But of course it 's best to have you by your side
and. . .
But of course you can go on with your life
good, great
Okay
Would you like to help the baby with a name?
or you take it
It will be all right

Miss Mitchell
what are you doing now?
gosh gusmin
It 's the first time I hear you so angry
Pregnant and cycling around in this crazy city
Well, I 'm wearing a helmet
Does your son wear a helmet?
Is that little fish big kid wearing a helmet?
Speaking of small fish . . . you see
you are the first to see
Are you pregnant with quadruplets?
What? Nope, it 's the same baby
- I 'm joking - all right

this is the spine
this is the head
It seems to contain the entire universe
Are you OK?
fine
I just never saw this kind of photo

for you
I have four
Alright, see you another day

good


- no- ok
You are not in this situation
- no! - OK



well. . .

Hi dear, is dad coming tonight?
My Father? No, why?
I mean baby 's dad
Oh yeah, I forgot I had a baby
No, my amniotic fluid broke early, and then... .
I messaged him that he was out of town
To understanding

we are not husband and wife
He 's a nice guy, but we 're not...
I don 't know why I 'm talking about this
I don 't know either, but I heard
Honestly, we 'd rather
because a lot of people passed out

baby 's heartbeat
It 's a little early, but I can 't stop it now
I haven 't decided whether to have a painless delivery or not. I can wait and decide, right?
If it really hurts
' if' ?
Push hard! Come on, Maggie!
force
come on, keep pushing
very good
great! Would you like to pat your baby 's head?
- I don 't know, do you want it? - Of course, come
- This is your baby - Omg, my mom!

Okay, come on, we 're going to do it again
- I can 't, I can 't- come on

No, I 'm so tired, I can 't
- Push harder - I 'm out of power, no
You 're going to push as hard as you can, you know?
I can 't, I can 't
Baby 's heartbeat is a little too fast right now We need you to cheer up and give birth to the baby
again, come on, come on

Come on, that 's it, do your best
Come on, push hard again

very good

well done, Maggie



Oh my god!






What a nice view
- well done - thank you


Would you like to hug her?
hug another day



Gusmin, she 's not a bomb

I don 't want to wake her up


Shh, New York, shut up

Come on me cute little girl

Right?
Omg, I 'm so sorry, hope it didn 't take too long
Thank you so much - for helping me take care of her, Gusmin - wow!

I 'm so sorry for suddenly saying that there is a meeting
- hi, hi, darling - it 's alright

happy to take care of her
what are you doing
I am at my home

What are you doing when Mommy is away?
We went to a big room with lots of animals, stuffed our stomachs and we had Gusmin 's lunch
American Museum of Natural History
I 've never been there, full of fun
- we should go upstairs - i 'll take this
- thank you so much - you 're welcome
Okay, let 's go, let 's go
go home, thank you

- Break! - good night

- Bye bye, Sarah - Bye bye!
You can 't go to see the dinosaurs by yourself.
No, I promise


No way

I can not sleep
Need sleeping pills?

I 'm so happy I got a job

She won 't be able to walk to school, and . . . the air is so bad and the people are hypocritical
When are you leaving?
We 're still considering, evaluating possibilities

And this building
