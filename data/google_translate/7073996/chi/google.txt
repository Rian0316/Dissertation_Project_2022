The good news is that you 're fine. It 's not a heart attack.

Your blood pressure is a bit high but understandable in that case *my shadow*
Just a false alarm
* And me *

Jimmy Don

OK

He said the fire was in the bedroom
A lantern somehow tipped over and then
The patrolman said he went quickly

So he wasn 't in a lot of pain, of course they said that
Did you see the backyard, his microwave, his stereo, his lights?
dishwasher
so many kitchen appliances
All electricity is in the back
not firefighters

I saw him five days ago

All lights are on

something made him relapse

Juan Bolsa wants to see you

Okay, thank you

Line 2
Yes

I 'll go make a copy for you





Bruce Lee is fast
He can kick you before you see him move
Have you seen the Liston scene?
Okay are we talking about boxing?
That 's another matter
no we 're talking about street fights
Street fighting luggage dragons are good
No, we 're not talking about fights in movies
We 're talking about heavyweight arm-length boxing as a sport
Martial arts is a battle of life and death
I don 't care how fast you are
If Muhammad Ali hits you, you have to lie down
This is a fact
if he can hit
Bruce Lee knows how to dismantle tricks

he has a trick
He can find a flaw
If you don 't have the strength to find flaws, you can 't hurt people
how much does he weigh
I don 't know, maybe 130 pounds [about 120 pounds]
Ali is the heavyweight champion
He is at least 90 pounds heavier than Bruce Lee
Bruce Lee feigned to hit Ali 's head but his body dropped
Sweep his legs and tripped him to the ground
Ali fell heavily to the ground and the game ended
- does he have a gun - what did you say
Does Bruce Lee have a gun?
because if he doesn 't have a gun
Ali can take him out in three minutes.
Hear or not, that 's what I think, that 's what I 'm thinking
wait a minute
Did you sign Tina 's birthday card?
- no- mind signing

no problem

I tell you your reason is too far-fetched
I just said if Li wanted to sweep Ali 's legs
he will sideways dodge
Ali is fast for his size
But if he gets kicked
I don 't know how to deal with it
I know how he 'll deal with it, he 'll stay still
impossible
- thanks - it 's fine
Will Bruce Lee do drunken fistfights?
He will catch you off guard










What 's up
Ramirez
- Team Leader - is Mr. Ramirez what do you think you are doing?
we 're just moving things
Any questions
Can you tell me why none of your men are wearing waist guards?
waist support
Usually we don 't wear
Stop what you are doing and go to the equipment room
Put on the glove
to wear
Rules are rules, understand?
good good
faster
Pause
stop
stop




excuse me
this should be yours
God
Thank you
where did you find it
I want to talk to your manager I passed security with ease using someone else 's name tag
no one looks at me
when the legal holder appears
There is no company-wide check on who has sneaked in. The door of the passage is not locked, or the password is left open, and it is written on post-it notes and posted everywhere.
Warehouse worker using pen and paper
Rather than electronic inventory devices opening the door to convenience
There are duplicate routing numbers on the shipment
There are surveillance blind spots on the north and east floors
Inventory accounting documents thrown directly into the trash
Not to be crushed, let alone
Dangerous driving loading equipment and staff . . .
- wait a minute - ignoring safety . . .
stop who are you
ermensott security consultant
with all due respect
I don 't know what security consultants are coming. How can you know that at your level?
You should ask the top
Just Lydia Rodart-Quell






Really sorry Jimmy
Thank you Clifford thank you very much

He 's a really good lawyer, yeah

Good rice

we will miss him terribly
thank you Brenda

I am sorry for your loss
thanks Brian
jimmy i 'm sorry
Thank you very much





I think I owe you a truth about Chuck
those lights


He 's in the house with no electricity
It 's been almost two years
He knows how to use a lantern and he 's always careful what I see with my own eyes
I know you do too
never had a problem
I know it 's cruel to say this now . . .
But I don 't think it happened by accident


You probably heard that Chuck retired from the law firm, but that 's not true

The truth is that we have a disagreement
i drove him away
I forced him to leave
Chuck was sick for years after the hearing . . .
It has nothing to do with the hearing, okay?

He actually started to get better after the hearing.
He cares more about the company
He came to work and we turned on the lights
He kept getting better until the insurance thing came out
So it 's not the reason for the hearing
insurance
a very ridiculous thing

I should have counted
He 's done enough for me but he 's still not done

So I am angry
what 's with the insurance
is our professional negligence insurance
They found out what happened to Chuck
increased rates
Chuck is angry
he wants to go to war
I set a baseline
He wouldn 't budge so I forced him to leave

I never thought I 'd hurt him
He always looks so strong
but he is not
He died because of me

howard i think you deserve it



See how much she swims
i want to make some coffee
who wants it
