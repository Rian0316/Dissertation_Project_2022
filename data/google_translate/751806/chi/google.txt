Without his silly questions, I have to worry about the newspapers Nosillyquestions, nobrightideas, nofussingaboutthepapers all day long.
Bernard I sometimes suspect that ministers cannot feel their existence unless they are in the papers. I thinkour M inisterdoesn  ' tbelieveheexists .
I bet you the first thing he said when he got back to the office was I 'llbetthefirstthinghes aysis, 'Is there any media coverage of my Washington speech'? 'A nyreportsonmy Washingtonspeech?'
How much? How much? A pound.

Minister, don 't you think? Sir Humphrey is quite right. Would  ' tyouagree , M inister ?

The official answer is exactly this Thecorrectofficialrepl y .
But I 've been pondering But I 'vebeenthinkingverydee plyoverthelastfewdays for days, and there 's no doubt that the ad hoc came to the point and there 's snodoubtthatthiscommi tteeisontosomething.
Waste of course exists Ofcoursethere 'swaste.
Each of these cases has its own excuse.
But after you said it I realized we were wrong But you haveconvincedmeo urapproachiswrong .
Ministers and their civil servants are always covering up problems and defending each other.

I 'm an old-school guy Betty Well, I ' manold-fashionedsortofchap, B etty, I believe in something called 'loyalty' and I believeinathing called loyalty. Internal conflict can 't be resolved internally, right? Humphrey?
