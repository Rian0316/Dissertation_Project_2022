 I didn 't get to where I am without knowing how the world works , son .
 I understand that , Arthur .
 And I 'm used to getting what I want , so why don 't you just tell me what it 'll take ?
 I 'm sorry .
 Don 't prat about , son , just give us the bottom line .
 I 'm afraid I ...
 My theme park is the biggest in the North of England ... most of it built with these hands .
 In five years we 'll be the biggest in Europe .
 - Yes , but ... - No buts , son .
 Just tell me what I have to give you and Joe 90 here to win that tender .
 I 'm afraid the tenders are all sealed .
 Sealed , my ass . Harry .
 There 's £25, 000 there .
 I won 't be beat by some bloody Yank dressed up as a mouse .
 Well , this is most irregular .
 Are we doing business , or what ?
 Like I said , I usually get what I want .
 Once the deadline has passed ... we can get working on having it moved for you .
 This will put us right up there with the big boys .
 I 'm sure it will .




 All I 'm saying is , you know , if I was a bird , well , I 'd shag me .
 Can you hear yourself ?
 I reckon she 's gotta be a lesbian , ain 't she ?
 Just because she knocked you back ?
 Listen , mate , I don 't get knocked back , okay ?
 Unless they 're either A : Lesbian , or B : Frigid .
 - Or both . - Exactly .

 - Maybe she 's got a boyfriend .
 - So ?
 Well , maybe she 's happy with him .
 Mate , happy , so what ?
 Why go for second best ?
 Mick , straight off , okay ?
 If you was a bird , would you shag me ?
 He 's having a crisis of confidence . The new receptionist blanked him .
 It 's very simple .
 Yes or no ?
 No .
 Well , that 's because you 'd be a lesbian .
 Stacie , what 's our working capital like ?
 Yeah , it 's healthy .
 Why ?
 Albert 's got a bite .









 which he shares with his wife Janice and two dogs .
 How did you find him , Albert ?
 We 're both members of the same gentleman 's club .
 We were on nodding terms until I learnt recently about his new fortune .
 So you became firm friends ?
 The best .


 No , please .
 Don 't worry , my dear ... it 's the second little vice I think we should use .
 Which is ?
 I discovered it when I borrowed his newspaper .


 Who 's a naughty boy then ?
 - The wire .
 - The wire ?
 Nobody 's worked the wire in 100 years .
 Last time I saw that was in
 It 's an old- time scam , it 's pre- 1900 .
 Racing results used to go from east to west ... by Western Union telegraph .
 All you had to do was convince the mark ... that you had someone on the inside who could delay the results ... until you got the bet on .
 Danny .
 - Are you listening ? - Yes , Mickey .

 Ash , can we make it work ?
 Yeah , but everyone watches races live these days .
 - Yeah , but not in person . - No .

 The principle still holds good , I suppose .
 Just have to use video link instead of telegraph .
 Albert ?
 It 's big .
 So are we .
 What can I get you ?
 - I 'm looking for someone .
 - Aren 't we all ?
 Danny Blue .
 You know him ?
 Sorry , mate , never heard of him .
 On the off chance you meet him in the next few days ... could you give him this for me ?
 Yeah , okay , if it said £ , I say you gave us a tour of London .
 - Yeah , thanks .
 - Yeah ?
 Thank you .
 You 've got a chip on your shoulder .
 You should lose it , or you 'll always feel on the outside .
 What 's new ? I 've been on the outside all my life .
 In a good crew , that will make you a liability .
 - I know that . - Then deal with it .

 Will you be lunching with us , Mr. Winstone ?
 No , thank you , my colleague and I have some business to discuss .
 - The library is free . - Lovely .

 How do you remember all your names ?
 I don 't need to .
 In places like this , it 's their job to remember them .
 This is a guaranteed winner , Uncle James .
 You have just got to take my word on it .
 I 'm sure you 're right , dear boy , but I 'm afraid I don 't gamble .
 Anthony , I thought you 'd be in hiding .
 Nasty business .
 That 's the problem with the great unwashed .
 They hate to see a fellow make a few pounds .
 I 'm sorry , Anthony , this is Peter , the son of a very old friend of mine .
 - How do you do , sir ? - How do you do ?

 Anthony 's having a bit of trouble with the press .
 You 're joking . They are scumbags , aren 't they ?
 You 've had dealings with them ?
 Not personally , sir . My dad did , a few years back .
 He was an activist in the anti- Euro campaign .
 - Press were all over him .
 - Really ?
 Now , best forgotten , Peter .
 Anthony , won 't you join us ?
 Here , take my seat , sir , I 'm just off .
 No need on my account .
 No , really , I only popped in here to make Uncle James a few quid .
 But as ever , he weren 't interested .
 Horses for courses , dear boy .
 Anyway , we 'll talk later . Nice to meet you , sir .
 Goodbye , Uncle James .
 Say hello to your mother for me .
 I will , definitely .
 Bye- bye .
 Black sheep of the family through his teens ... but has turned out to be a rather nice young man .
 He 's in investments ?
 God , no . Horses .
 - Horses ? - You know , the racing variety .

 Had a " hot tip " or whatever it is they call it .
 Did he mention the name ?
 - Name ? - Of the horse .

 Yes .
 It 's ...
 No , it 's gone .
 But just as well , Anthony . A fool and his money are soon parted .
 Some coffee ?
 Paul !
 - All right ? - Yeah .

 What 's a nice place like this doing with a girl like you ?
 - I take it it went well . - Yeah .

 You 'd have been proud of me . I was a real team player .
 Your round , Danny .
 Hello .
 I was wondering if you could tell me what won the last race ?
 Anywhere .
 That 's excellent . Thank you .
 I heard you got blanked by some bird at the hotel .
 I did not get blanked , okay ? She 's a lesbian .
 Right .
 Had some bloke in here earlier , looking for you .
 What bloke ?
 He didn 't leave his name , but he left his number here somewhere .
 It seems it 's true , what you say .
 About a fool and his money .
 There 's a chap in here .
 He was apparently conned into believing he was buying the London Eye .

 Really ?
 Apparently turned up to take possession .
 - What was he thinking of ? - I can 't imagine .

 Thank you .
 Problem is , some people don 't deserve money .
 When chaps like us earn a few bob ... they call us fat cats .
 I mean , I don 't moan when one of the plebs wins the lottery , do I ?
 I could hardly put it better myself .
 Providing he doesn 't move in next to me , of course .
 Margo 's Girl .
 I 'm sorry ?
 That horse you asked me about , Margo 's Girl , 1 : 00 p . m .
 It just came back to me .
 Where was it running , do you know ?
 I have no idea .
 I wonder if it won ?
 It 's easy enough to find out .
 Paul , there was a horse running today , Margo 's Girl .
 Could you see how it did for me , there 's a good chap .
 - You 'll be sick if it won . - I never gamble .

 There 's nothing wrong with an occasional flutter .
 I don 't know one end of the horse from the other .
 It 's the sport of kings , old chap .
 You haven 't lived till you 've seen your horse ... running up that hill at Cheltenham .
 I 'll have to take your word for it .
 Margo 's Girl won , sir .
 - Price ?
 - 12- to- 1 .
 Good Lord .
 This nephew of yours , what does he do exactly ?
 Tell you the truth , I 'm not sure . Just something to do with horses .
 I 'd very much like to meet him again .
 Well , I 'm sure that can be arranged .
 You must be Danny .
 - Wasn 't sure you 'd come . - Well , I was curious .

 Listen , mate , I ain 't got all day , so who are you and what do you want ?
 The name 's Ray Fordham .
 Are you as good as they say you are , Danny ?
 What are you then ?
 Cop ?
 Do I look like a cop ?
 Well , they come in all shapes and sizes , don 't they ?
 I 'm a grifter , just like you .
 Are you ? How come I never heard of you then ?

 You have . Scottish Ray ?

 You 're Scottish Ray ? But you ain 't even Scottish .
 The name came from my first big con .
 I took a £50, 000 down payment on Edinburgh Castle .
 Yeah , I 've heard about that .
 ' 9 , weren 't it ?
 ' 95 .
 I took another £20, 000 for putting in double- glazing .
 Don 't you just love the Yanks ?
 Yes , they 've got romance in their soul .
 All right , I 'm glad to meet you , Ray .
 Likewise .
 So what can I do for you , mate ?
 I 'm putting a new crew together .
 Yeah ? Well , I know some people .
 I don 't want people , Danny . I want you .
 Well , I think we 've hooked him in enough to give him a convincer .
 Ash , what about this place you 've found ?
 Well , it has to be a build .
 Okay , but let 's make it good .
 How long ?
 Couple of days , if I can get enough bodies .
 Yeah , do it .
 You should have been here half an hour ago .
 Sorry .
 Right , Albert will set up the meet with Danny for the day after tomorrow .
 - You have to be ready by then .
 - I will be .
 Stacie , work out the costs with Ash , then double up with Danny later on .
 Questions ?
 Okay , let 's do it .
 Problem ?
 No .
 A friend of mine down here tells me you can find anyone .
 If who you 're looking for is in London , I can find them .
 How much is that going to cost me ?
 Depends who it is ... and what you 're going to do when you find them .
 Two con men , one black , one white .
 I 'm gonna kill them .
 How 's it going ?
 Decoration 's easy enough , but we need to start getting the hardware in .
 What 's the setup ?
 Five or six furlong races are the best bet .
 Means the race is over in a minute to a minute- and- a- half .
 - Good . You 've got everything you need ? - Yeah .
 You 'll know when I haven 't .
 Steady with those . Teddy wants them back .
 James , what a lovely surprise .
 This is Peter , and his young friend , Yvonne .
 Come in , I 'll fix you some drinks . Anthony 's in the lounge .
 - James , welcome .
 - Thank you .
 - Peter , nice to see you again .
 - Sir .
 And who is this vision of beauty ?
 This is Yvonne .
 I 'm delighted to make your acquaintance , my dear .
 Sir Anthony .
 Do you mind if I steal this young man ?
 Be my guest .
 James tells me you 're a betting man .
 Not really , sir .
 Playing dumb ? Lets see if a few drinks will loosen you up .
 That 's what I like to see .
 A mark who does all the hard work himself .
 Okay . We get the TV feed in here showing us the live race .
 Obviously we can 't fix the races , they 're legit .
 But this little baby holds up the pictures until the end of the race .
 When we 've got a winner , we 'll give it to you .
 You 've got two minutes to put a bet on ... before we start feeding it through the front .
 As far as anyone is concerned , they 're watching the race live .
 Two minutes isn 't very long .
 You slow up the pictures any more , our man might smell a rat .
 It 'll have to do .
 Right . The main area is fully functioning .
 I 've tapped into a street light for electricity ... re- routed mains water for the toilets .
 As long as he doesn 't kick the walls ... they should stay up long enough for the job .
 It 's a work of art .
 Yeah . I 've got 20 grifters coming in as punters .
 When they 're here , it will be the doggie 's whatsits .
 - Okay , then we can start tomorrow . - Yeah .

 All I 'm asking is that you throw the odd tip my way .
 It 's more than my job 's worth .
 You did it for James .
 Yeah , but he 's virtually family . I mean , he 'd do anything for me .
 With all due respect , sir , I hardly even know you , do I ?
 James will vouch for me .
 Will he , now ?
 So what are you ?
 A racing man , are you ?
 I think I 'm what you 'd call an enthusiastic amateur .
 Listen , what I 'm about to tell you mustn 't go any further .
 You have my word .
 I work for a syndicate .
 We buy racehorses .
 I knew it . You 've got inside knowledge .
 It 's slightly more than that .
 Last year the company that I work for teamed up with three other syndicates .
 Then at Kempton last year , we realized that between them ... they owned all the runners in a single race .
 Really ?
 From there it 's just a short step to being able to determine ... which horses are going to win certain races .
 You mean , fix them ?
 I 'm just saying they know who 's going to win ... before they start .
 I 'm not saying fix them .
 And you can get the names of the winning horses ?
 Me ? No . I 'm much too far down the food chain .
 But the horse you told James about .
 Well , that came from Yvonne .
 Your girlfriend .
 Can I be honest with you ?
 - Absolutely .
 - Come here .
 Listen , I 'm trusting you completely here .
 I hope Uncle James ain 't got you all wrong .
 I can assure you he hasn 't .
 Now , the truth is ...
 Yvonne and me aren 't really together .
 She 's a high- class escort . Absolutely lovely .
 I mean , I take her out every now and again .
 Last week , I gave her number to my boss .
 She spends a bit of time with him . She overhears him talking on the phone .
 Now the thing is , he 's got a bit of a crush on her .
 So he wants to see her again .
 I don 't blame him .
 So , I gets to thinking maybe I can find out a few more winners .
 I went to Uncle James because , basically , I ain 't got the funds to finance it .
 So you 're looking for a backer ?
 Well , we wouldn 't be having this conversation if I weren 't .
 I mean , the most I could raise last time was £1, 000 .
 - But you got £12, 000 back . - Well , yeah .

 But what if I had £10, 000 ?
 Looks like we have a nibble .
 I 'm gonna have another crack at Frosty .
 All right ? Chatty as ever .
 See you .
 Hey , that 's quite a team .
 Stacie Monroe , Albert Stroller , " Three Socks " Morgan ... and the great Mickey Bricks .
 What are you doing here ?
 I just wondered if you 'd made your mind up yet .
 We 're in the middle of a score .
 And what 's your cut , Danny ?
 Who 's calling the shots ?
 See , all you 're doing is using your talent to make Mickey Bricks look good .
 Big up his reputation .
 I 'm learning off him .
 And as long as you 're doing that , he 'll treat you like a kid .
 Clock 's ticking , Danny .
 It ain 't that easy . I owe them .
 Well , the choice is yours . You know where I am .
 You 're never gonna move up in class , not until you break free .
 All set ?
 You 're sure a bet of this size will go unnoticed ?
 Listen , there 's a private gambling club the syndicate uses sometimes .
 I 'm a member there .
 Strictly for high rollers .
 It 's all cash , no questions asked .
 I 've seen people place bets of up to £250, 000 there .
 No one even bats an eyelid .
 If we stick to one bet a day , no one 's gonna notice us .
 I 'm going to put in all my winnings from last time .
 All £12, 000 ?
 Why not , when you know you can 't lose ?
 Where to ?
 No worries .
 Okay , guys . Car 's pulled up .
 Okay , everyone ... showtime .
 Stacie , out of sight .
 This is my card .
 You wouldn 't even know this place was here .
 It 's strictly members only .
 It gets me away from the damn press .
 We 've got roulette and blackjack through there .
 Can you believe it ? £20, 000 , beaten by a neck .
 Next time remind me to back a giraffe .
 This is the poker room .
 - Peter .
 - Mike .
 - How you doing ? - Hello .
 Long time no see .
 Good seeing you .
 How you doing ?
 - This is my guest Anthony Reeves . - It will be a pleasure to take your money .

 Not today , Mike . We 're feeling very lucky .
 Yeah . You and everyone else in here .
 That 's Mike Taylor , the manager .
 He seems very full of himself .
 Yeah , but not for long , right ?
 Okay , Yvonne will call as soon as she gets the horse .
 It 's going to be close to the start , so you get your bet on ... as soon as it comes through .
 All right .
 There 's my money .
 Well ?
 The last two , the odds are too high .
 Stacie ?
 If they win too much it 'll break us before we start .
 Take 3- to- 1 or less .



 Flak Jacket .
 - Price ?
 - 2- to- 1 .
 Okay , go .
 - Hello .
 Right .
 Dancing Ridge to win in the next . £50, 000 to win .
 £50, 000 .
 Thank you , sir .
 - Here you are , sir . - Thank you .

 £2 , 000 to win . Flak Jacket in the next race . £2 , 000 to win .
 Thank you very much .
 Here we are , sir , thank you very much .

 They 're off .
 Flak Jacket , 2- to- 1 .
 Go on , son , come on .
 Just relax .
 Come on , Flak Jacket .
 Come on , son .
 - Get your whip out , boy . - He 's coming .

 That 's it !
 Go to the rail !
 Come on , Flak Jacket !
 Show them the way . Come on .
 Come on , my son !
 Yes !
 What did I tell you ?
 Beautiful .
 You little beauty .
 It hasn 't been confirmed yet , sir .
 That 's £ 8, 000 , plus your stake .
 That 's £72, 000 in all . £20, 000 , £30, 000 , £ 0, 000 ... £50, 000 , £60, 000 , £70, 000 and ... £2, 000 .
 Here we are , sir .
 What 's your maximum bet , mate ?
 - We have no maximum , sir . - Thank you .

 Let 's do it again .
 No , one race a day . We agreed .
 - One more won 't make any difference . - We 'll draw attention to ourselves .

 Now let 's just go , okay ?
 Flak Jacket .
 I can 't believe it was that easy .
 You wouldn 't believe what I had to do to get that horse 's name .
 I don 't know .
 Try me .
 Listen , the thing is , if we want to make real money ... we need to put one big bet on while Yvonne 's still on the inside .
 There 's no rush , surely ?
 Well , what if he calls the agency and asks for another girl ?
 He 'd be mad .
 No , Yvonne 's right . We don 't want to take that risk .
 And anyway , when all this is over ... you two lovebirds get to spend the week together , don 't you ?
 - Just as promised , Tony . - So we do .

 So what do you think ?
 He wants one more smaller bet , just to make sure .
 - Wonderful ! - It wasn 't Danny 's fault .

 The pot is empty , we can 't pay out .
 Everything was geared to take him in for the big one next time .
 - He 's this close . - Close does not cut it , Danny .

 It can 't be helped . We 'll have to shut him out .
 You know , sometimes a desire for perfection ... can be misinterpreted as criticism .
 - Is that so ? - Yeah .

 Why so grumpy ?
 I don 't know .
 Is it Rachel ?
 I had the decree nisi .
 It 's all over .
 Why didn 't you say ?
 How would that have helped ?
 Could have reminded you that everyone here loves you .
 Maybe after this one , we should take a break for a while .
 I think we should do £50, 000 .
 Whatever you say .
 Hello .
 Put it on Mostarsil .
 Run it now , before he gets to the window .
 Mostarsil in the next . £50, 000 to win .
 The race has started , sir .
 - No , I said it before they started . - I 'm sorry , sir .

 Problem ?
 - I was trying to place a bet . - The race has started , sir .

 No more bets . Try the next race .
 Come on , Mostarsil !
 Christ !
 - 10- to- 1 , that 's £500, 000 ! - I didn 't get the bet on .

 - What ? - I didn 't have time .

 That 's £500, 000 .
 Shit !
 No , wait . I want to see what they 're doing .
 Okay , so he 's gone for the bait , and we 're all set for tomorrow .
 Stacie , Danny , go reel him in .
 Any thoughts ?
 Think you 've covered everything .
 Then go bring him in .
 And no mistakes this time .
 I know , but I 'm teaching him .
 You 're smothering him .
 Give him his head .
 Maybe you 'll see in him what I did .
 What I saw in you once .
 We 've got a problem , we 're gonna have to meet up .
 Yeah , okay .
 What about 6 : 30 ?
 All right . Thanks , Anthony .
 This country 's got stalking laws , you know .
 Just thought I 'd let you know I 'm heading back tomorrow .
 I check out of the hotel at 3 : 00 .
 That 's fine , but I haven 't made a decision yet .
 You 'll be there .
 What ?
 The syndicate 's being investigated .
 - Why ? - I don 't know , all right ?
 It is .
 Someone got wind of it . It 's all off .
 - It can 't be . - I 'm telling you , it is .

 They 're gonna do one tomorrow , then pulling the plug .
 Wait . You said they 're doing one more .
 It 's already set .
 - Why can 't we do it , too ?
 - Are you having a laugh ?
 The authorities will be watching that race like hawks .
 They 'll be watching the syndicate , not us .
 I don 't know .
 What do you think ?
 Risky .
 He who dares and all that .
 Surely it 's worth the risk ?
 If we 're gonna do this ... it has got to be a big bet .
 Because I 'm telling you , this is the last chance .
 Absolutely .
 The most I can raise is probably going to be about £30, 000 .
 You 've got to be joking . I 'm not risking getting caught for that .
 So how much would it take ?
 £500, 000 .
 - What ? - £500, 000 .
 Even if we only get 2- to- 1 again , we 'd clear £1 million .
 It 's too rich for my blood I 'm afraid .
 We could have a wonderful week with £1 million in the bank .
 I 'm sorry , no .
 Well , if you 're not up to it ...
 It 's not a question of not being up to it ...
 I just can 't afford to lose that kind of money .
 How could you lose ?
 I mean , you 've seen how it works .
 Even so .
 £500, 000 .



 Okay , I 'm in .
 Bank manager thought I was insane . I had to threaten to close my account .
 He 'll calm down when you pay double back in .
 You 're sure they 'll take a bet this size ?
 You heard the man . No limit .
 Gentlemen . Feeling lucky again ?

 I think we 'll be okay .
 Think so ?
 I do hope that 's full of money .
 We 'll soon wipe that smile off his face .
 Just ignore him .
 Yvonne will phone the horse through , and then she 'll meet us here .
 I 'll get us a drink .
 - Anything ? - Favorite won the last .

 - We 've gotta try and get bigger odds . - Wait .



 Got it .
 Place it all on Roofer in the next race .
 Yeah , I 'll see you there .
 Roofer .
 8- to- 1 . That 's £ million !

 They 're in the stalls .
 Get the bets on !

 Here you go .
 Roofer in the next race .
 £500, 000 pounds to win .
 - Is there a problem ? - One moment , sir .

 What 's wrong , Paul ?
 This gentleman wants to place a large bet , sir .
 How large ?
 £500, 000 .
 - Price ?
 - Roofer .
 8- to- 1 .
 I understood there was no limit .
 - Take the gentleman 's bet . - I haven 't got time to count it .
 If the horse wins , we 'll count it ... and pay out on whatever 's there . Take the case .



 Thank you , sir .
 Thank you very much .
 - That 's it . - Yes .

 So , you get it on all right ?
 Roofer , £500, 000 to win .
 To win ? I told you " place . "
 - What ? - I said " place . "

 The syndicate went for a place to throw everyone off the scent .
 That 's what I told you . I said , " Place it on Roofer . "
 That horse finishes third .
 There 's been a mistake . I want my money back .
 - Sir ? - I meant to say " place , " not " win . "

 The race has started , sir .
 I don 't care , I want my money back !
 - House rules dictate that ... - Give me my money .
 Come on , take it easy .
 What the hell is going on ?
 You don 't understand . There 's been a mistake .
 There was no mistake , sir . Your horse just lost .
 Get off me !
 Aren 't you Sir Anthony Reeves ? Boys , get some shots .
 This is what you 're doing with your golden handshake , sir ?
 Gambling with the taxpayers ' money ?
 I 'm not betting , I don 't gamble .
 - Did this man place a bet with you , sir ? - That 's confidential .

 Can you explain to our readers why you 're in a private gambling club , sir ?
 I 'm visiting a friend .
 Do you think it 's fair that the taxpayers should fund your gambling habit ?
 Come on , sir , what have you got to say to our readers ?
 More important to the taxpayer , sir ?
 It 's a nice car . Did you fund that out of your winnings , sir ?

 There it is .
 Well done , everyone . All right , let 's get out of here .
 Wages in Eddie 's Bar tomorrow night . Let 's go .
 - Well done , mate . - All right , mate .

 Now this is all over , there 's something I need to tell you .
 The thing is ...
 Look at you . Rats in a sewer .
 Eyesight better ? What was it ? Laser ?
 I hear they 're very good .
 What can we do for you , Arthur ?
 What can you do for me ?
 You could try dropping to your knees , kissing my feet ... and begging me not to paint the walls with you .
 But I 'll settle for what you 've just taken off the last mug .
 I 'm sorry , I don 't know what you 're talking about .
 You 've got 10 seconds .
 Give him the money , Danny .
 - Hold on a minute .
 - Shut up .
 No .
 I 'm sick of him telling me when I can speak and when I can 't .
 - I 'll handle this . - Like you do with everything ?


 I 'm sorry , Mickey , but unless I 've missed something here ... you 've just led us up shit creek and forgot to pack the paddles .
 And that 's what this is all about , isn 't it , Danny ?
 ' Cause you think you could do better .
 Everything you 've done since you got out of nick has been down to me .
 Down to you ?
 Except for the parrot impressions : You do them yourself .
 You were a short con artist , Danny ... working the clubs and bars for drinks till I took you in .
 Yeah , you gave me a shot , and I 'm grateful for that ... but I 've been carrying you ever since .
 No , the only thing you 've been carrying is an over- inflated ego .
 You shouldn 't be so hard on yourself , son . You do have some qualities .
 Is that it ?
 That 's it , huh , Mick ?
 The answer to all your problems .
 Things ain 't going quite your way , take a swing .
 Lash out .
 You screwed up .
 Now give the man his money back and move on .
 I was gonna do it when you started this .
 You were going to give him the case of funny money .
 It 's what he asked for .
 And how long would it take him to realize this cash is crap ... come back here and kill us ?
 Well done . Brilliant . He didn 't know it was fake until you just told him , genius .
 You don 't think he 's gonna find out ?
 This stuff , mate , wouldn 't pass in a corner shop !
 So what would you do ?
 Give him our money ?
 If it 's a straight choice between that and death ?
 Yes !
 That would clean us out .
 Mickey , he 's holding a shotgun !
 We 'd have nothing !
 If you wanna get killed , for what ... £60, 000 , £70, 000 , go ahead .
 Fine .
 Do it , Mick .
 For once in your life , do the right thing .
 What happened to you ?
 What 's in the drawer , Ash ?
 Like you said , £60, 000 , £70, 000 , tops .
 Pay the man .
 I suggest you do what the young man says .
 And make sure there 's none of that funny money in there .
 I 'm sorry , Mick .
 £50, 000 profit in four days , not bad .
 Like I told you boys , I usually get what I want .
 Did you feel it ?
 Amazing .
 - I 'm dripping ... - I 'm sorry .
 Taking your revenge .
 All right , come on , everybody , let 's get out of here now !
 Did you have a good day , dear ?
 Conmen , my ass . They thought they were dealing with a bloody idiot .
 Some country boy from up north , still wet behind the ears .
 They won 't make that mistake again .
 Take more than a bunch of Southern Jessies to get the better of me .
 You all right , boss ?
 Right . Just wait a second .
 Wait .
 I 'm going now , so I won 't be pestering you anymore .
 So I guess what I really wanted to know is ... why you wouldn 't go out with me .
 Okay , that 's it .
 ' Cause you 're a lesbian . Yes ! There 's nothing wrong with that .
 I bloody knew it .
 - No . - Yes . Absolutely , yeah .

 - Danny , you wanted to talk to me .
 - When ?
 Before Arthur came in you said there was something you had to say .
 Oh , that . It was nothing .
 - Sure ? - Positive .

 Only I thought you were going to tell me you were joining Scottish Ray 's new crew .
 - You knew that ? - I know everything .

 - Are you two still squabbling ? - Time to go .

 - We 'll be gone for a while . - Have a well- earned rest .

 - But we know what you 're thinking . - Gap in the market .

 - Think you might try your luck ? - Easy when you know how .

 But if you do ...
 You gotta remember the first rule of the con .
 You can 't cheat an honest man .
 - Can 't happen . - Impossible .

 Find someone who wants something for nothing .
 Which shouldn 't be hard .
 And then give them nothing for something .
 Thank you , Captain .
 You know , I 've been thinking .
 I 'm not getting any younger .
 Maybe I should retire . Bow out gracefully .
 - You 're serious ? - Absolutely .

 - It 'd be a crying shame , Albert . - You 'll find someone else .

 There 's no one quite like you , Albert .
 Albert , it 's your choice . Whatever you decide .
 Thank you , Michael . ... so I said to this guy , " You 're crazy .
 " My old man leaves me $3 million ...
 " and I 'm going to invest in molasses ? "
 I told him . I said , " I don 't know nothing about shoes . "
 Do you want me to hold your drink for you , Albie ?
