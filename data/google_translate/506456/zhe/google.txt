Every Saturday morning E very Saturdaymorning I ride from the farm to Farnham Station I bicycle from thehouse to Farnham Station I take the 12:22 train to catch the 12:22 totown .
There is a sparsely populated T hereisoneveryquiet and lonelystretchofroad on one side of the road is the Charlington heath thatliesbetween Charlington Heathontheonehand and on the other side is the Charlington Manor Woods and thewoods of Charlington Hallontheother .
Two weeks ago today I passed that road Twoweeksagotoday, I waspassing thisplace and happened to look back when I saw a man when I chancedtolookbackands awaman, also riding a bicycle alsoonabicycle.
I also saw him when I went back on Monday. T hefollowing M onday when I returnedhewasthereaga in .
I understand I see . Same goes for last Saturday and Monday A ndagainlast Saturday , andagainlast M onday .
Have you mentioned this to your employer?
H a v e   y o u   m e n t i o n e d   t h i s   t o   y o u r   e m p l o y e r ?
Mentioned that Yes. Mr. Carruthers was very worried about Mr. Carrutherswasveryconcerned,
and ordered horses and buggies andhasorderedahorsean dtrap
So that I don 't have to hit the road alone sothatinthefuture I shouldnottravelunacco mpanied.But they haven 't got to Butthey 'venotyetarrived.
What about this morning? A ndthismorning?
He stalked me again Hewasfollowingmeagain .
I slow him down I sloweddown, buthedidthesame.
I parked he also parked Then I stopped completely, buthedidthesame.
So I have a plan to deal with him S o , I laidatrapforhim .
There is a sharp turn on this road T hereisasharp turning of the road , I turn fast and I pedaledveryquicklytow ardsthis then stop and wait andthenstoppedandwait ed.
But he just disappeared out of thin air Butheseemedtodisappear intothinair.
Can you describe this man? Can you describe thisman ?
I know you have only seen him from a distance I realizethatyou  ' veonlyseenhimfromadis tance .
Yes Yes . He wears dark coat and dark glasses Hewearsadarksuit , darkspectacles ,
Bearded andhehasabeard. Not young?
Young , old ? Probably middle-aged He  ' saboutmiddle - aged .
To see if I have made a mistake in terrainN ow , letmeseeif I havethegeographycorrect .
This is a road with a sharp bend on this side Hereistheroad , withasharpbendinither e .
On this side, Charlington Heath, Onthisside, Charlington Heath, on the other side is Charlington Manor Woods andontheother, thewoods of Charlington Hall.
How long have you been waiting for him in the corner?
H o w   l o n g   d i d   y o u   w a i t   f o r   h i m   h e r e   a r o u n d   t h e   b e n d ?

Are there any forks around?
A rethereanysideroads ? No onealongthisstretch on this road.
Could it be that he went to the heather path?
C ouldhehavetakenafootp athacrosstheheath ?
I think if I could see him then I think I wouldhavenoticedhim .
Therefore, according to the method of exclusionary reasoning S o , byaprocessofexclusion , it is concluded that he walked into the wearriveatthefactthathemadehiswaytowards

Charlington Hall Woods. How does Mr Carruthers make a living? No owhowdoes Mr r.
C arruthers makehisliving ? He is very rich Oh, he  ' sarichman .
But no carriages or horses Butnocarriagesorhorses.

Very well V erywell . Mr Carruthers will have to add details as appropriate Mr r . C arruthers will havetofi llinafewdetails
To satisfy my personal curiosity formyprivatecuriosity,
But I 'd love to tell but I amhappytodothetalking. First Inthefirstplace,
The three of you came from South Africa thethreeofyoucameacro ssfrom S outh A frica . Wrong I have never been to South Africa ! W rong , I  ' veneverevenbeenin S outh A frica !
is true It  's true .
Woodley found the beast Woodleyacquiredthiscre atureafterourreturn after we got back.
Very good you and Woodley V erywell , you and Woodley met Ralph Smith had known R alph Smith S outh A frica in South Africa .
You believe that he shall die soon Youhadreasontobelievet hathewouldnotlivelong, and find that his niece shall inherit his estate andyoufoundoutthathis niecewouldinherithisf ortune.

Right? How  ' sthat ? You told her that her uncle died in poverty and Butyoutoldthegirlherun clediedinpoverty .
Because he was apparently dying Well, ashewasstillalive, admittedlyonlyjust, I think this rich man did not make a will andawealthymanwho I suspecthadmadenowill.
Ralph Smith can 't read or write R alph S mithcouldneitherreadn orwrite .
So you and Woodley come back to find his niece S o , you and Woodleycameoverhere and huntedupthegirl , and that you would share the heplunder , knowing shewasthenexto fkin that Willett is his dearest.
As a notary fee I can also get a share of I wasduea shareforservic esrendered .
And Carruthers A nd Carruthers , you made a mistake you made the mistake to fall in love with her offalling in love with her r .
For the first time in my life I knew what love was, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
H olmes . Why didn 't you tell her about her dangerous situation? W hydidn  ' tyoutellherofthedange rshewasin ?
Because . . . B ecause - because then she will leave me B ecauseshewouldhavelef tme ,
I can 't stand this and I couldn 'tbeartofacethat.
What about my daughter Sarah? Oh , whatwillhappentomydau ghter , Sarah ?
She will be well taken care of by We 'llseeshe 'swelltakencareof.
Although she won 't fall in love with me Yousee, evenifshecouldn 'tloveme, but I can see her in the house itmeantagreatdealtose eheraboutthehouse and hear her voice andhearthesoundofherv oice.
You call it love Mr. Carruthers Youmaycallitlove , Mr.
C arruthers , I call it selfish I should callitselfishne ss .
Maybe the two coexist Maybethetwothingsgotog ether .
But I want to protect her But I tried to protecther ,
I never let her go through this house alone where I knewthoserascalswerel urking
I will keep my distance and wear a fake beard so she won 't recognize me sosheshouldnotrecogni zeme .
Then I think you got the telegram? Then I presumethecablearrive d ?
Telegram What telegram? C able , whatcable ?
'The old man is dead' ' THEOLDMANISDEAD .'
