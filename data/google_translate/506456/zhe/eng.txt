 Watson .
 Yes .
 Watch .
 The chemical reaction you are about to witness will solve the mystery concerning the persecution of Mr. John Vincent Harden .
 Excellent , the tobacco millionaire , shall I take notes ?
 No , I will dictate in the fullness of time .
 There 's a young lady wishes to see you , Mr. Holmes .
 This is not a convenient moment !
 She 's very well spoken , a genuine lady . No doubt .
 And persistent , too .
 Mrs. Hudson , I , too , am extremely persistent , especially when I 'm working .
 It is a matter of great urgency , Mr. Holmes , or I would not be troubling you on a Saturday evening .

 Perhaps you could , uh , delay your chemical reaction , Holmes .
 Very well .
 Do sit down , Miss , uh ?
 Violet Smith .
 Dr. Watson .

 Thank you Mrs. Hudson .
 A genuine lady , I told you .
 Oh , please .
 Um , thank you , I 'll be quite happy here .
 Very well , Miss Smith , you must tell us your matter of great urgency .
 It is obviously not your health .
 So ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy . Yes , I bicycle a good deal .
 Slight roughening on the side of the soles caused by the friction of the pedals .
 Excellent , Watson .
 The marks on your shoes .
 Oh , yes !
 Even if I have to travel a long way ,
 I take my bicycle on the train with me as I did today .
 You will excuse me , but it is my business .
 Yes , I nearly fell into the error of supposing you earned a living by typewriting , but of course , it is obviously music .
 You will observe , Watson , the spatulate finger ends , which is common to both professions .
 There is a spirituality about the face , however , which the typewriter does not generate .
 This lady is a musician .
 Why , yes , Mr. Holmes , I teach music !
 In the country , I presume , from your complexion .
 Near Farnham on the borders of Surrey !
 But please , let me explain why I am here .
 I am an only child , and my father died some years ago .
 His name and profession ?
 James Smith , he conducted the orchestra at the old lmperial Theater .
 Ah , the old lmperial , Holmes . Yes .
 Please continue .
 My mother and I were left without a relation in the world except for one uncle , Ralph Smith , who went to Africa 15 years ago , and we have not had a word from him since , despite our Christmas cards and photographs .


 Mr. Holmes , I have to tell you that --
 I think you wish to tell me that you and your mother are very poor , not withstanding your obvious grace , dignity and talent .
 We were very poor .
 Ah .

 About four months ago , in February , we were told there was an advertisement in the Times , inquiring for our whereabouts .
 You can imagine how excited we were , for we thought that someone had left us a fortune .
 I went at once to the lawyers whose name was given in the paper .
 Now , this is Miss Violet Smith .
 The solicitor introduced me to two men , a Mr. Carruthers and a Mr. Woodley .
 They were on a visit from South Africa .
 I wish I could tell you your uncle left you a vast fortune , but as I said ...
 He died in extreme poverty .
 However , I myself am not without means .
 My mother and I never sought charity .
 No , nor do I offer it .
 Please .
 I have a question to ask of you .
 Your Uncle Ralph said you were very musical , do you teach music ?
 Yes .
 Miss Smith , I am now a widower with a 10- year- old daughter .
 Young Sarah .

 She needs a music teacher .
 So , you see , I do not offer charity .
 A job , he wants to give you a job !
 Whereabouts in London do you live , Mr. Carruthers ?
 I don 't .
 I live about six miles from Farnham , in Surrey , at Chiltern Grange .
 I couldn 't possibly leave my mother on her own .
 I will pay you 100 pounds a year .
 A hundred a year ?
 Yes .
 Approximately double the market price , I think .
 Oh , at least !
 Which you obviously accepted , or you wouldn 't be here now .
 Yes . I accepted the offer .
 Mr. Carruthers agreed that I should go home every weekend to my mother in town .
 So this is one of your weekend visits to London ?
 It is .
 Tell me about your life at Chiltern Grange .
 For a while , it was quite perfect .
 Every Monday morning I would take the train to Farnham and then bicycle from the station to the house .
 The little girl 's name was Sarah , and she was delightful , as well as being a very good pupil .
 That was very much better , Sarah . May I try it again ?

 Of course , that 's why we 're here .
 Mr. Carruthers was appreciative of my work , and an extremely kind and considerate host .
 Sounds idyilic . It was .

 What happened to spoil it ?
 A visitor .
 Mr. Woodley .
 However did you guess , Mr. Holmes ?
 Miss Smith , I never guess .
 Tell me about his visit .
 He arrived and was to stay for a week .
 But to me it seemed like three months .
 Oh , that odious red mustache !
 One evening after dinner ,
 Mr. Carruthers had to leave us for a minute to see somebody at the door .
 A gentleman to see you , sir .
 Will you excuse me ?
 That 's better .
 Better , in what way ?
 It 's better to get the old folk out of the way .
 I don 't regard Mr. Carruthers as old .
 Oh , yes , but he isn 't young ...
 like us .
 I do wish you wouldn 't blow smoke in my face , Mr. Woodley .
 Oh , I don 't believe that for a moment .
 What don 't you believe ?
 When women say they wish you wouldn 't do something , it generally means the exact opposite .
 I mean precisely what I say !
 Mr. Woodley , will you please leave me alone !
 No .
 To tell you the truth , I won 't leave you alone , not until I 've said what 's in my heart .
 Whatever do you mean ?
 I 'm not very well up on the social graces , but I 'm prepared to learn , if you 're prepared to teach me .
 Oh , this is absurd !
 It isn 't absurd !
 I 'm asking you to marry me !
 I mean it , it 's from the heart .
 Money isn 't a problem ,
 I did very well out in South Africa .
 Whatever you are accustomed to , I can give you better , better that you 're accustomed to ; jewelry , diamonds .
 You want diamonds , oh , I can give you diamonds .
 I don 't want diamonds !
 Oh , you think about it . I won 't rush you .
 I 've thought about it , and the idea is ludicrous .
 Well , you can 't blame me for trying !
 You 're very beautiful .
 Listen , just to show there are no hard feelings , what about a little kiss to be going on with , hmm , just a peck on the cheek .
 Mr. Woodley , will you please stop it !

 Oh , I told you before about women who say stop it .
 No !
 The more they struggle , the more fun it is .
 Mr. Carruthers , will you stop him !

 Get out of this house !
 All right !
 I 'm going .
 I 'm not interested in old men , and old maids !
 I can only offer you my most sincere apologies for what has happened .
 If I give you my assurance that it will not happen again , for my daughter 's sake , will you stay ?
 Yes , I will stay .
 Thank you , Violet .
 Mr. Woodley left the house and I have not seen him since .
 The blackguard !
 Has there been any change in the behavior of Mr. Carruthers ?
 No , he continues to be polite and considerate and courteous .
 Now , Miss Smith , please , please continue .
 Yes , there is something else .
 Oh , it may be a mere fancy of mine , but it seems to me that Mr. Carruthers shows a great deal of interest in me .
 Oh , he has never said anything , he is a perfect gentleman , but , a girl always knows .
 So I believe .
 And I assume that these feelings that you sense from Mr. Carruthers are not reciprocated ?
 He is a kind and generous employer , but I am already engaged .
 Oh , the name of this very fortunate young man is ? !
 Cyril Morton .
 He 's an electrical engineer with the Midland Electric Company in Coventry .
 We 're to be married at the end of the summer .
 We wish you joy .
 Thank you .
 Yet , I am puzzled as to why you have chosen to consult me .
 It is an intriguing story , to be sure , but I sense you are frightened , and do not understand why .
 You seem well capable of protecting yourself .
 Please , help me , Mr. Holmes !
 What is it ?
 I am being followed .
 Followed , by whom ?
 A cyclist . Every Saturday morning
 I bicycle from the house to Farnham Station to catch the 12 : 22 to town .
 There is one very quiet and lonely stretch of road that lies between Charlington Heath on the one hand and the woods of Charlington Hall on the other .
 Two weeks ago today , I was passing this place when I chanced to look back and saw a man , also on a bicycle .
 The following Monday when I returned he was there again . I see .
 And again last Saturday , and again last Monday .
 Have you mentioned this to your employer ?
 Yes .
 Mr. Carruthers was very concerned , and has ordered a horse and trap so that in the future I should not travel unaccompanied .

 But they 've not yet arrived .
 And this morning ?
 He was following me again .
 I slowed down , but he did the same .
 Then I stopped completely , but he did the same .
 So , I laid a trap for him .
 There is a sharp turning of the road , and I pedaled very quickly towards this and then stopped and waited .
 But he seemed to disappear into thin air .
 Can you describe this man ?
 I realize that you 've only seen him from a distance . Yes .
 He wears a dark suit , dark spectacles , and he has a beard .
 Young , old ?
 He 's about middle- aged .
 Now , let me see if I have the geography correct .
 Here is the road , with a sharp bend in it here .
 On this side , Charlington Heath , and on the other , the woods of Charlington Hall .
 How long did you wait for him here around the bend ?
 Oh , no more than two minutes .
 So he could not have retreated back down the road .
 Are there any side roads ?
 None along this stretch .
 Could he have taken a footpath across the heath ?
 Oh , the heath is totally flat and bleak .
 I think I would have noticed him .
 So , by a process of exclusion , we arrive at the fact that he made his way towards
 Charlington Hall .
 Now how does Mr. Carruthers make his living ?
 Oh , he 's a rich man .
 But no carriages or horses .
 Well , at least he 's very well off .
 He goes into the city two or three times a week , and he sometimes refers to his gold shares .
 Yes , I see .
 You must let me know immediately if there are any fresh developments .
 I am extremely busy just now , but I will find time to make inquiries into your case .
 Thank you , Mr. Holmes .
 In the meantime , take no step without letting me know .
 I 'm sure we shall have nothing but good news for you .
 I do hope so , Dr. Watson .
 Very lovely girl . Yes .
 And it is part of the settled order of nature that such a girl should have followers , but for choice , not on bicycles in lonely country roads .
 You really think she may be in some danger , Holmes ?
 Oh , yes .
 On the following Monday ,
 Holmes found that he had business which detained him in London , so , he dispatched me on the early train to Farnham that I might observe Miss Smith 's passage past Charlington Hall .


 The setting was just as she had described , heavily wooded on the side bordering the hall , and utterly exposed on the other .
 I selected the only available cover , and waited .
 Watson , you have wasted your time . I thought I did rather well .
 No , your hiding place was ill- chosen .
 You should have been in the bracken on the other side of the road .
 Then that way you would have had a close view of this fascinating solitary cyclist .
 Thank you .
 As it is , you were a hundred yards away and can tell me even less than Miss Smith reported to us last Saturday .
 You describe him as bending low over the handle bar ?
 Yes , quite low .
 Thus concealment again , which in your case worked perfectly .
 Oh know , you really have done remarkably badly .
 He goes back to the Hall and you come all the way back to London to call on a house agent .
 Well , I found the information I was seeking .
 You found the name Williamson , which conveys nothing to my mind .
 Well , we know he 's elderly and respectable .
 And therefore , unlikely to be the energetic cyclist that sprints away from that athletic young girl .
 Well , what should I have done ?
 Gone to the nearest public house .
 That is the center of country gossip .
 They would have given you every name from the master to the scullery maid .
 Instead of which , you give me -- Williamson .
 So , what have we gained by your expedition . The fact that the girl 's story is true ;
 I never doubted that .
 That there is a connection between the cyclist and the Hall ;
 I never doubted that , either .
 The Hall is tenanted by a man called Williamson .
 Who is the better for that ?
 I shall go back tomorrow and visit the public house .
 No , my dear sir , do not commit yourself to rashness because you are temporarily depressed .
 We can do nothing useful until Saturday .
 Did I really do remarkably badly ?
 Yes .
 Very beautiful . Thank you , Mr. Carruthers .
 It is a new piece .
 I need to practice it more .
 No , I don 't mean the music .
 Violet , I have a question to ask you .
 Morning , Holmes .
 A letter from Miss Violet Smith .
 Now Carruthers has proposed marriage to her . Carruthers !
 Gentlemen are permitted to propose marriage , Watson .
 Of course he didn 't know about Cyril .
 Are you going to Farnham ?
 I want to test one or two theories which I have formed .
 Shall I come with you ?
 No , that will be neither useful nor necessary .
 Try the nearest public house , always a good center for country gossip .
 Thank you , Watson , capital notion !
 Ah , Good afternoon , Landlord .
 May I have half a pint of your local ale , please ?
 Certainly , sir .
 Here you are . Thank you .
 You may keep the change .
 That 's most generous of you , sir , but I couldn 't .
 I haven 't done anything to warrant such generosity . I 'm about to give you the opportunity .
 I need some information .
 Oh , I 'm not one for idle gossip , sir .
 Neither am I , I prefer facts .
 Tell me about the people at Charlington Hall .
 You mean Mr. Williamson , sir ?
 Yes .
 Well , he -- he was in here not more than five minutes ago .
 You just missed him .
 Tell me about Mr. Williamson .
 Is he an elderly , respectable gentleman ?
 Oh , he 's elderly , no doubt .
 Far be it from me to speak ill of people behind their backs , but I 'm none too sure about respectable .
 Really ?
 He is an ex- clergymen , I reckon .
 Ex ?
 Apparently .
 He was struck off , or whatever it is happens to clergymen .
 That 's doctors that are struck off .
 Tell me about the other people up at the house .
 Well , they 're just domestic staff , and they 're all local and God- fearing .
 Of course .
 He do have folk up there at weekends .
 Weekends ?
 Yes , sir .
 Weekends .
 Ah , no problem .
 What sort of folk ?
 Oh , they 're a warm lot .
 Warm ?
 Yes , the sort you don 't want to get too near for fear of getting burnt like .
 That 's good .
 Oh , you may think it 's good , sir .
 They don 't come down well in the village , I can tell you .
 There was one fellow in particular .
 Particularly warm , is he , this fellow ?
 He is very particularly , sir .
 I 'll wager he has a red mustache .
 Hey , do you know him ?
 I never met the gentleman .
 Well , now is your chance .
 Mr. Woodley .
 None of your damn business !
 Our Landlord keeps a very respectable house , and your language is not welcome .
 Who do you think you are ?
 What the hell do you want coming here asking all them questions ?
 You 're quite right , Landlord , clearly not a gentleman .
 Oh , I 'm as much a gentleman as you are .
 Everybody here will bear witness to the fact that I am acting in self- defense .
 Swine !
 No , sir , a gentleman !
 Only a ruffian deals a blow with the back of a hand .
 A gentleman uses the straight -- left ... and I , sir , am a gentleman !
 It was absolutely delicious , Watson . So I see .
 A straight left against a slogging ruffian .
 I emerged , as you see .
 And the slogging ruffian ?
 Mr. Woodley was taken home in a cart .
 There 's that horrible man again .
 Which man ?

 I thought I saw Mr. Woodley in the garden today .
 You did .
 He 's staying in the area .
 But do not worry , I have told him quite firmly he 's not to set foot inside the house .
 " Dear Mr. Holmes :
 You will not be surprised to learn that I will be leaving Mr. Carruthers 's employment on Saturday . "


 The odious Mr. Woodley has reappeared at Chiltern Grange .
 Ah , but at least she won 't be bicycling to the station .
 So finally , the rich Mr. Carruthers has acquired a horse and trap .
 Yes .
 Look here , " all my troubles will be over on Saturday . "
 Tomorrow , Holmes , all her troubles will be over .
 Why do I worry about that word .
 Which word ?
 " Trap . "
 Oh , what a splendid morning , Holmes !
 It 's acceptable weather for the time of year .
 Now who would want to harm that dear girl on such a morning ?
 I hope nobody . So why did you bring your revolver ?

 I 'm talking about my hope , not my expec- tations .
 What ?

 I fancy that is our Miss Smith .
 She must be traveling by an earlier train .
 I give her a margin of half an hour , but she 'll be past Charlington Hall before we can possibly meet her .
 So what can we do ?
 We could run .
 Fool , I should have allowed for that earlier train !
 It 's abduction ,
 Watson , it 's abduction , murder , heaven knows what .
 Stop that horse .
 Good man .
 Come on , Watson !
 Let 's see if I can repair the consequences of my own blunder !
 Up there !
 Holmes .
 Where did you get that cart ? !
 Where is Miss Violet Smith ? !
 That 's what I 'm asking you .
 You were in her cart !
 It was on the road , there was no one in it !
 Somebody seems to have gone through this way !
 We must find them !
 Come , Watson .
 Now look , do you know who this is ? !
 That 's Peter , the groom , he was taking her to the station .
 He 's alive , his pulse is strong .
 Mustn 't be left lying there too long .
 Let him lie , we can 't do him any good , but we might save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman .
 Where are you going ? !
 The house !
 They didn 't go to the house !
 They went this way to the left .
 Are you sure ?


 Oh , cowardly dogs !
 Too late !
 Watson .
 Too late by the living Jingo !
 For as much as John and Violet have consented together in holy wedlock , and have witnessed the same before God and this company ...
 and have declared the same by the giving and receiving of a ring , and the joining of hands ,
 I pronounce that they be man and wife , together .
 Congratulations !
 Thanks , amen .
 They 're married !

 Welcome to the party , gentlemen .
 Let me introduce you to Mrs. Woodley .
 Don 't Carruthers !
 Carruthers !

 Yes , and I 'll see this woman righted , if I have to swing for it .
 You 're too late .
 She is my wife !
 No , she 's your widow .
 I told you what I 'd do if you molested her !
 By the Lord , I 'm a man of my word !
 When you hired me , nobody told me there 'd be any of this damn nonsense !
 Drop that pistol .
 Watson , pick it up !
 Give me that revolver , we 'll have no more violence . Who are you to be giving these orders ?

 Sherlock Holmes .
 Good Lord .
 Here , you !
 Sir ?
 Are you well enough to drive into Farnham ?
 Yes , sir , I reckon I am .
 Then give this note to the superintendent of the police station .
 In the meantime ,
 I must detain you all under my own personal custody .
 How are the patients , Doctor ?
 Miss Smith 's very well , considering the foul way she 's been treated .
 And Woodley ?
 Alas , I have no doubt he will live .
 What , I 'll go upstairs and finish him off .
 No , sit down in that chair , Carruthers . You 're right .
 He isn 't worth swinging for .
 But do you tell me that girl is to be tied to Roaring Jack Woodley for life ? !
 You needn 't concern yourself about that .
 I married them till death do them part .
 Under no circumstances can she be considered his wife .
 Are you sure ?
 For two very good reasons .
 In the first place , we are very safe in questioning Mr. Williamson 's right to solemnize a marriage .
 I have been ordained .
 And unfrocked .
 Once a clergyman , always a clergyman .
 I think not .
 How about the license ?
 Oh , we had a license .
 I have it here .
 Undoubtedly obtained by a trick .
 But , in any case , a forced marriage is no marriage , indeed , it is a very serious felony , as you will discover .
 Now , while we are waiting for the police , Mr. Carruthers , you might tell me your story .
 If you squeal on us , Bob Carruthers ,
 I 'll serve you as you served Jack Woodley ! There 's no need for you to get over- excited .
 The case is clear enough .
 Well , if it 's clear enough , why don 't you tell us . Very well .
 Mr. Carruthers will have to fill in a few details for my private curiosity , but I am happy to do the talking .

 In the first place , the three of you came across from South Africa .
 Wrong , I 've never even been in South Africa !
 It 's true .
 Woodley acquired this creature after our return .
 Very well , you and Woodley had known Ralph Smith in South Africa .
 You had reason to believe that he would not live long , and you found out that his niece would inherit his fortune .
 How 's that ?
 But you told the girl her uncle died in poverty .
 Well , as he was still alive , admittedly only just , and a wealthy man who I suspect had made no will .
 Ralph Smith could neither read nor write .
 So , you and Woodley came over here and hunted up the girl , knowing she was the next of kin , and that you would share the plunder .
 I was due a share for services rendered .
 And Carruthers , you made the mistake of falling in love with her .
 The first time that ever I knew what love was , Mr. Holmes .
 Why didn 't you tell her of the danger she was in ?
 Because -- because she would have left me , and I couldn 't bear to face that .

 Oh , what will happen to my daughter , Sarah ?
 We 'll see she 's well taken care of .
 You see , even if she couldn 't love me , it meant a great deal to see her about the house and hear the sound of her voice .
 You may call it love , Mr. Carruthers ,
 I should call it selfishness .
 Maybe the two things go together .
 But I tried to protect her ,
 I never once let her go past this house where I knew those rascals were lurking without following her on my bicycle to see she came to no harm .
 I kept my distance and wore that beard so she should not recognize me .
 Then I presume the cable arrived ?
 Cable , what cable ?
 " THE OLD MAN IS DEAD . "
 What old man ?
 I imagine Ralph Smith in South Africa .
 Yes .
 But by this time you and Woodley had quarreled and he had left the house .
 Woodley came back again to ask me to stick to the bargain .
 I refused .
 I said I would have nothing to do with violence .
 One last detail , why was Woodley chosen as the prospective husband ?
 I am ashamed to say it ...
 we played cards for her .
 Holmes , I have the results of the trial .
 Listen to this , the judge in summing up said --
 Holmes .
 Watson , may I be permitted an educated guess ?
 Go on then .
 I would expect Woodley to get ten years ,
 Williamson seven years , and Carruthers , in view of the eloquent speech I made on his behalf at the trial , probably six months .


 That is exactly right !
 Well , I have certain advantages , Watson ,
 largely the fact that I sent out for the early edition .
 An undoubted advantage .
 Also , we have received a present , some wedding cake from Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Morton , together with a letter telling us that Mrs. Morton has inherited a large sum of money from her uncle , Ralph Smith , formerly of South Africa .



 The happy couple are thoroughly enjoying
 looking after young Sarah Carruthers , while her father is in custody .
 Her piano playing is improving and she wants to take up bicycling .
 A splendid day all round , wouldn 't you say ?
 There is more splendor yet to come .
 More splendor , what do you mean ?

 Watch carefully .
 Oh , I remember , the chemical reaction that will solve the mystery concerning the persecution of Mr. John Vincent Harden .
 Precisely .
 I 've spent the entire week in the lmperial Science Museum and I think this is the answer .
 Is that the answer , Holmes ?
 Yes , that is the answer , Watson .
 Well , let me think .
