Well the laser source is ready
I should have brought an umbrella
Why? It won 't rain again
I know my delicate skin is likely to get sunburned by the moonlight.
Are you kidding us?
One of the coolest tricks, don 't you think?
Howard, can you check the equatorial inclination of the laser again?
we need to lock it in the still sea
OK
please Raj
People spend a lot of money to develop an online world full of naked women, you can 't afford to peep
Not at all
I 'm watching someone else 's TV
Are you playing 'Legal Women'?
Tell you this is the successor to my family 'Grey 's Anatomy'
L e o n a r d   L e o n a r d
What is that? What is it?
Relax, it 's just a dirty sock
How can you see dirty socks and say relax?
S heldon smelly dirty socks all over the world
not in my world
Anyone know who should watch this experiment?
penny
I don 't think she likes 'Laser Moon Ranging'
But Armstrong 's reflectors on the moon should be part of the shiny series she loves.
Why don 't you call her here?
It 's a bit weird to say it 's not good. . .
Did she dump you?
she didn 't dump me
We 're just out of step emotionally
I don 't understand how geography is involved in a relationship
very simple
Leonard lives in 'Don 't Leave Me' town and Penny happens to move to 'Goodbye' isle
go to hell you guys
I 'll go see if she 's home
I 'll point it at the moon if it 's convenient
wait a minute
'Woman' is crying
The plot isn 't going well
Season 3 Episode 23
OK, what 's the matter?
Are we playing with moon reflected lasers on the roof?
sorry what did you say ?
It 's fun, we prepared a two-meter parabolic reflector and other equipment
Would you like to take a look?
just bullshit
How can you possibly bounce something off the moon?
There 's no gravity at all
L eonard this is Z ack
Z ack this is Leonard
sorry i didn 't know you had guests
- How about next time? - Okay, next time
I want to see what laser
What about the party?
It 's a surprise party. You can go anytime.
That 's right
ok then come on
How did you two meet?
My company designs the menu for 'Cheesecake Workshop'
your company ?
My dad 's but my sister and I are vice presidents
So . . . design the menu
It sounds very simple to design, but it uses a lot of scientific principles.
Are you satisfied?
remove dirty socks
thank you
Raj watch where the other goes
Hi everyone this is my friend Z ack

Wow laser machine ?
so arrogant
That 's right
In 1917, Einstein published the article 'The Quantum Theory of Radiation' and mentioned that his greatest wish is that the machine invented by this theory can be very powerful.
Wish come true
Let me introduce this experiment
Astronauts on Apollo 11 in 1969 installed reflectors on the surface of the moon
We 're going to shoot a laser at one of them and wait for it to bounce back to this photomultiplier
so cool
ask
How can you guarantee it won 't explode?
Laser ?
i mean the moon
See, this is Penny 's boyfriend
Good question Z ack
nonsense
S h e l d o n
What a stupid question to ask politely
How could anyone think we 're going to blow up the moon?
That 's a good question
Don 't worry about the moon
We set the laser intensity to only 'stun'
smart
So we can watch the light come out
But when the naked eye observes the retroreflection of the beam, it will not be too strong to hurt the eyes
naked
yes very interesting
The equipment over there measures the amount of reflected photons that we can see directly from the computer
Raj get them two glasses
Cool is it 3D?
Getting ready to fire a laser to the moon
just do it
Got it!
There is a peak!
Two and a half seconds later, the light is reflected back and this is the moon!
We hit the moon!
Is this your experiment?
Just for the lines on this screen?
Yeah but you have to think about what that means
If we can achieve this goal, we can fully prove that there are man-made objects on the moon. They were put on by some species. They just invented the plane 60 years ago.
What species is that?
I was wrong just now
P enny can find a better one
Okay guys thank you very much it 's interesting
thanks
Are we going to invite them to the party?
You don 't have to keep walking, that 's all
He must be good in bed
I told you man, if you want to forget about Penny, you 're going to have to brace yourself and ride the tits
Are you up?
- what? - it should be 'cheer up' not 'ride the tits'
that 's nasty dude
that is not. . .
forget it
But he was right
If you want, I can refer you to a few new dating sites that you recently found.
thank you
Are you sure? They can say they can find a match for anyone
Did they find a match for you?
a bunch
I dated about eight times last month
If it 's the ones who come and go, there are twelve times.
I can 't get the nitrogen tank off
why ?
ok let me reiterate
It 's very heavy and people don 't want to do it.
let me help you
Thank you
hold it down, don 't carry it
Good night
Do you know what makes it interesting?
Register S heldon on a dating site
oh yes
think about it
Let 's take this as an experiment
It 's like Frankenstein finds a wife when he 's lonely
His wife is not looking for
They made him a wife out of corpses
OK, let 's make it a backup plan.
Come in !
fuck you, you son of a bitch
you 're drunk ?
Zack is a perfect man but you ruined him!
How did I destroy him?
Because if it was in the past I wouldn 't know how stupid he was
Please he 's not that stupid
he is the one !
He thinks you 're going to blow up the moon!
yeah, he 's really stupid
He bragged all night about how he coined the word appetizer
But how could it be my fault?
You ruined my ability to put up with idiots
follow me now
to . . to where ?
Let 's do what we love
Why? I mean okay
what happened ?
Put on your noise-canceling headphones because it 's going to be noisy right away
come again
What kind of low pulp fiber is this?
Good morning Penny
Do you have eyes behind your head?
Someone who gets beaten every day at school has to develop a keen sense of hearing
By the way someone gets hit because he always refers to himself as 'someone'
I 'm making english muffins do you like english muffins ?
thank you i 'm not hungry
Also, my noise-canceling headphones don 't seem to be of good quality.
Sorry as a native Texan I have to say I 've never heard 'drive' used in this context
oh god
oh god
I 've heard this so many times.
What kind of 'micro focus' is this?
This has to be the worst day of my life
good morning leonard
How many times have I told you to stop doing that?
Count this time?
3 1 7 times
What about Penny?
she went back to her apartment
I guess I threw up in the shower.
Not necessarily in the order I said
Why didn 't she say hi to me?
Do you expect me to explain human behavior?
I know it 's just that the bystanders are clear
You may have some unique opinions. It 's not hard to believe that you are not butter.
(This butter brand is called 'Can 't Believe It 's Not Butter')
uh i gotta go
morning shift
I 'll take you down
It was fun last night, huh?
yeah it should be
I just vomited in my closet
so miserable
Anyway, let 's watch a movie tonight
I 'm afraid I won 't be able to tonight
It doesn 't have to be today
I 'm pretty much the same anyway. . . I 'm free every day
Leonard was a mistake last night
By 'mistakes' you mean lucky mistakes? Like the discovery of penicillin?
listen i 'm sorry
I 'm drunk and lonely and hate Z ack
Let 's forget all about it
No, I remember it very well.
Especially the part where you ride
Oh my God !
Is that so?
I 'm cool thank you Leonard ?
listen I 'm sorry
Don 't hold me and let me go, okay?
How can I not hold on and let go?
You came to me just for fun!
good morning Mrs G underson
good morning leonard
Or should I say 'drive'?
my girl
what ?
We finally found evidence of alien existence
what ?
This dating site has found the right person for S heldon
What an international joke about a real woman?
yeah look
boobs etc.
Trust me, having boobs doesn 't mean I 'm a woman
Why ?
I 'll show you a picture of my uncle Louie in a bathrobe when I get time
Leonard you have to see this
We made a match for Sheldon
marvelous
Maybe she can have sex with him
Then he left without saying 'how did you sleep' the next morning? Do you know what he was talking about?
I don 't know, ask him
Leonard what did you say?
I do not want to say
what is your suggestion?
whatever
Now Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send a letter to his best mate
' hello living friends . . .
She can do it, so can I
She can do it, so can I
She can do it, so can I
I can not do it
Hello ?
Hi L eslie
What did Leonard H ofstadter want me to do?
uh i know !
Haven 't seen you in a while!
yeah 1 8 months
Yes
right
How are you doing ?
Good
And you ?
uh good
Remember when we had sex and you said it doesn 't mean it 's just pure entertainment?
Remember
Do you, uh, want to do it again?
What 's the matter? Blonde dumped you?
she didn 't dump me
We 're just out of step emotionally
yes
Anyway, obviously
It 's okay to have fun with someone you 've dated before.
So what do you think?
I 'll think about it
she won 't come back

she wants to see us
it 's not us it 's him
Yes, but he doesn 't know her
uh but he 'll know
Really? We 'll tell him?
Who is going to tell whom what?
S h e l d o n

Your surprised look confuses me
I live here
correct
Listen, what are your plans for tomorrow afternoon?
more specific
half past four
it wasn 't afternoon
It was early evening
What? That 's the day time period I invented
It nicely defines that vague period between afternoon and evening early evening
It fills a pressing need and I 'm pretty sure this will catch on
Okay, what are you going to do tomorrow morning and evening?
tomorrow is saturday
Saturday night is 'laundry night'
So I use the whole morning and evening for pre-sorting and pre-soaking
Well what if I told you tomorrow at 4:30 you could meet a woman scientifically chosen as your perfect date ?
I 'll sneer and wave my arm. I can 't stand your stupidity.
but it 's true
We put all your must-have info into this dating site answered all their questions your way and they found you a match
her name is A my Farrah F owler
please
Even if you can answer the question my way
This is exactly our answer to 'How do you feel about online dating?'
Howard wanted to write 'bullshit' but I said no
Our Sheldon will say 'rubbish'
Come on, where did your curiosity about science go?
Most are used to explore the mysteries of the universe and the rest are wondering why I 'm talking to you about this
Well let 's put it that way
Spock both date every seven years
he is not dating
That 's 'Pangfa' (Wagang for mating)
His blood boils with the desire to mate
Then why do you . . . why don 't you start with a cup of coffee and you can 'Pang Fat' A my Farrah F owler
I don 't drink coffee
OK, can you drink hot chocolate too?
I don 't want to be involved in this boring anymore and my drink choices don 't make any sense
By the way I only drink hot chocolate in months with an 'R'
Why? Isn 't life amazing?
ok i 'm out of the way
S heldon I hid that dirty sock on the roof somewhere in your apartment
It 'll stay there forever unless you come with us to meet this girl
You 're bluffing. Do you want to take a risk?
i curse you
30 feet

Hi Leonard
I was a happy dull little lonely person, you ruined me!
you 're drunk ?
Come on, let 's have sex, let 's just have fun!
Are you crazy ?
It seems like a double standard
What do you prefer me to do when the plan fails in a few minutes and I gloat?
Is it the standard 'I 'll just say it'?
That classic 'Idiot right'?
Or my usual sarcastic expression?
I don 't know who is wrong
Then make fun of your face
excuse me
I am A my Farrah Fowler
You are S heldon Cooper
Hello A my Farrah F owler
I regret to inform you that you were deceived by those rubbish algorithms that were originally used to deceive naive and lonely nerds
Also someone is blackmailing me with hidden dirty socks
If that 's slang, I haven 't heard of it
I hate dirty socks as much as you do, literally
I 'm here anyway because I promised my mom at least one date in a year
Interesting
I also promised my mom to go to church once a week
I don 't reject the concept of God, but I don 't understand the idea of ​​believers
then you better not go to east texas
Understand so before you go any further you need to know that any form of physical contact including sexual intercourse is a no-brainer
Can I buy you a drink?
have a glass of warm water
God what have we done?
