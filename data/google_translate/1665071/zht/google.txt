Watson
(Dr. John Watson 's blog) How is the blog written?
Well, it went well
You didn 't write a word, did you?
You just wrote 'still don 't trust people'
And you read what I wrote upside down
Know what I mean?
John, you are a soldier. It takes a process to go from this status to an ordinary person.
blog about your everyday experiences
would be of great help
I didn 't experience anything at all

It shocked everyone who knew him

Give me two minutes friend what?
I 'm going back to get an umbrella

Just two minutes okay?
(18-year-old boy commits suicide in gym)
1 January 2 7
Is she still dancing?
yes if it 's called dancing
Did you take her car keys?
out of her bag
Where has she gone ?
Deputy Transport Minister Beth Deventer 's body was found at a London construction site late last night
Preliminary investigation found suicide
We can confirm that this suicide is very similar to
Jeffrey Sir Patterson and James Philmer 's condition
Because of this, we think there is a good chance that they are related
The investigation continues, but Inspector Lestrade will answer your questions.
How is the detective suicide related?
because they all take the same medicine
Corpses are showing up where they shouldn 't be
no apparent motive
There can be no serial suicide
Apparently there is no relationship between these three people?
Haven 't found a relationship yet, but we 're looking for something that must exist

(wrong) if you both got a text message please ignore it
It just says 'wrong'
yes leave it if there are no other problems
If you ask Inspector Lestrade, this is the end of this briefing.
Since it 's suicide, what are you investigating?
Like I said, the suicides are clearly linked
This is very unusual and we have sent the best people to investigate
Received 'wrong' again
last question
Could it be murder?
If so, is it a serial killer?
I know you guys prefer to write this kind of story, but the situation is a suicide
The difference between the two is obvious
It 's clear they took the poison themselves
Yes, but if they were really killed, how could everyone keep themselves safe?
Cherish life and don 't commit suicide
daily mail
Although now is the time of panic, what everyone needs is to be vigilant
Safety can be created by oneself
( wrong )
(You know where I am Xia Fu)
thank you all
you gotta stop this guy
Made us look like idiots
You tell me how he did it and I 'll go
John
John Watson
Mike Fellow at Stanford Barts School of Medicine
yes sorry mike hello
I know I 'm fat
I heard you went abroad and got shot
what happened ?
Just got shot
Are you still in Buzz? Teaching now
Smart young people are like us back then
God, I 'm annoying them, what about you?
Staying like this until you recover?
You can 't live in London on army pensions alone
You can 't live anywhere else
This is not the John I know. Watson
I 'm not that John Watson
Harry didn 't help you?
Do you think that 's possible
I don 't know how to find someone to rent a house with.
Who wants to be my roommate?
What 's up ?
You are the second person to say this to me today
who is the first ?
How fresh is it?
Newborn 67-year-old died of natural causes
I used to work here and I know good people
very good
So let 's start with the whip
Uh, are you in a bad mood today?
I need to know how it scars in 20 minutes
A person 's alibi is up to him, text me
By the way I think . . .
wait a minute if you 're done . . .
you put on lipstick
you never use
I want to look refreshed
sorry what did you just say?
I said do you want to go for coffee?
Black coffee and two candies, thank you for taking it upstairs
All right

You didn 't think about it, did you?
Can Mike borrow the phone?
I have no signal here
Is the landline broken?
I prefer texting
sorry in my coat
use mine here
oh thank you
This is my old friend John Watson
In Afghanistan or Iraq?
what ?
Which country is Afghanistan or Iraq ?
Afghanistan sorry how did you know?
Jasmine coffee is coming thank you
What about lipstick?
it doesn 't work for me
Is it? I find it useful
Your mouth is too small now
All right
How do you feel about the violin?
Sorry for what?
I play the violin when I 'm thinking about things, and sometimes I don 't talk for a day, do you mind?
Roommates should know each other 's shortcomings
you told him about me
not a word
Who told your roommate about this?
I myself told Mike this morning how difficult it is to find a roommate for someone like me
He came just after lunch and brought an old friend who had apparently just served in the Afghan army. Not hard to guess.

How do you know about Afghanistan?
I found a great place in central London
A price we can afford together
Let 's meet there at 7:00 p.m.
sorry i 'm so forgetful
Leave the whip in the morgue
this means ?
What does it mean?
We 've just met and we 're looking for a house together?
Is there a problem ?
We don 't know anything about each other, we don 't know where to meet
don 't even know your name i know you 're a medic fresh from afghanistan
repatriated
You have an older brother who cares about you but you don 't want his help You resent him maybe because he 's an alcoholic
More likely he just dumped his wife
I also know that the doctor thinks that you suffer from the psychological sequelae of disability. I 'm afraid this diagnosis is correct.
Is that enough for roommates?
My name is Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes 's address is Baker Street 2 2 1 B
good afternoon
yeah he 's always been like this
( Short message )
( Sent successfully )
(If the brother has a green ladder, arrest him Xia Fu)
( search )
( Sherlock Holmes )
( Baker Street Westminster )
Hello
Mr. Holmes please call me Sherlock
The location is good and it should be very expensive
The landlord, Mrs. Hudson, gave me a special price.
owe me a favor a few years ago
Her husband sentenced to life in Florida
I did my best
So you spared her husband the death penalty?
I didn 't testify against him
Sherlock
Mrs. Hudson, John Dr. Watson
hello come in
Thank you please come in
It 's pretty good here
really great
Yes
I feel the same way
So I just moved in
Just get this rubbish out of the way . . .

So it 's all . . . ok
I can put them away
This is a skeleton my friend
The friend I 'm talking about is . . .
What do you think of Dr. Watson ?
There is also a bedroom upstairs if you need two bedrooms
Of course you need two
Don 't worry, there 's everyone here
The pair from Mrs Teller 's next door is married.
Sherlock look at how messy it is
searched for you last night
Any interesting finds?
Found your site 'Deductive Research'
how do you feel ?
You say you can see a software designer by a tie and a pilot by a thumb
Yes
I see your military experience in your face and legs I see your brother 's alcoholism in your phone
What do you think?
What 's up with these suicides, Sherlock?
I think you will be interested
3 identical cases
4 up
The 4th happened and this time
Something different from the 4th ?
Where ?
How is Lauriston Gardens, Brixton different this time?
Otherwise you won 't come here specially
There must be something out of the ordinary
The victim never left a message before this time
are you coming ?
Who is in charge of forensics this time? Anderson
I don 't get along well with him
He won 't be your assistant anyway
i need an assistant
are you coming ?
If I don 't get in the police car, I 'm going to follow
thanks
Thick stick Ryoya
4 serial suicides, this time with last words
It 's Christmas, Mrs. Hudson
I 'll be late and may need to prepare some food
I 'm your landlord dear not the housekeeper
Cold is fine, John, have a cup of tea
make this your home
don 't wait for me
Just look at him and you 'll know, you 'll know to run out
so does my husband
I can see that you are a very calm type
I 'll pour you a cup of tea and rest your legs
its motherfucker legs sorry sorry
Sometimes these fucking things...
I know my darling, I don 't have a bad hip
Just a cup of tea, thank you, just say my dear
I 'm not a housekeeper
two more cookies if any
I 'm not your butler
(Inspector Lestrade is in charge of the investigation) You are a doctor
And a military doctor
Yes
Are you doing well?
very good
Then you must have seen a lot of corpses with tragic wounds
Yes
It 's hard too, I think?
Of course, I 've seen too many in my life.
Want to see more? Goodness ok

I 'm sorry Mrs Hudson is out of tea
Are you all drinking?
Impossible suicide cases? Four ?
There 's no reason to sit at home, life is finally fun
You 're dead, you 're so happy
whether he looks like it or not
the game begins mrs hudson
taxi
Well you have a question to ask
yes where are we going ?
Crime scene next question ?

Who are you and what is your occupation?
What do you think ?
I would guess . . a private investigator but ?
Police don 't go to private detectives
I 'm a 'consulting detective' the only one in the world
This job was invented by me
What is that? Whenever the police
I can 't find the way. They always do this. They will consult me. The police won 't consult the layman.
I mentioned Afghanistan and Iraq when I met you yesterday and you looked surprised
yes how do you know ?
I didn 't know it was observed
Your hair and manners are military style
And what you 're saying is right and wrong, it means you studied at Barts Medical College, so it 's obviously a military doctor.
Your face is tanned
But the wrist is not tanned
So you 've been abroad and it 's not sunbathing
You walk terribly limp but would rather stand than a chair completely forget about the disability
So at least a little handicapped
It also shows that because your wounds are traumatic injuries on the battlefield
Sudan, Afghanistan or Iraq
You say I have a therapist
You have a disability, of course there is a therapist
then your brother because of the phone
It 's expensive to send emails to listen to music
And you 're so poor that you 're living with someone
So you didn 't buy it as a gift
Not just one scratch, many, many
Must be in a pocket with keys and coins
You don 't do this to your own luxury so it has a master before it
The next point is easy, you should know
engraved words?
Harry Watson
Apparently it was a phone call from your family
It 's not your father, this thing is played by young people
Could be cousins ​​but you 're a homeless fighting hero not like a big family
So close relatives are brothers
And then Clara?
3 kisses represent a romantic remembrance
This price should be given by my wife, not my girlfriend
It should have been given recently for about 6 months.
After 6 months of marriage problems, he gave it away
If she dumped him maybe he 'd keep it as a souvenir
No, he wanted to throw it away, he dumped her
He gave you his phone because he wanted to keep in touch with you
You 're looking for a cheap house and you didn 't ask your brother for help so you had problems with him before
Maybe you like his wife maybe you hate his drinking
So how do you know about his drinking?
Just a wild guess, but it 's accurate
Some wear around the power socket
So he tried to plug it in every night to charge but his hands were shaking
This doesn 't happen on sober people 's phones. Every alcoholic has
Well you 're right
Where am I right?
The police do not consult the layman
This is . . . amazing
Do you think so? Of course
amazing really amazing
People don 't usually say that
What do others generally say?
get away
Where did I guess wrong?
Harry and I had a bad relationship, never had a good relationship
Carraro and Harry broke up three months ago and they 're getting divorced Harry is an alcoholic
I didn 't expect it all. I guessed it all.
Harry is a nickname for Harriet
Harry is your sister
What the hell am I doing here? Sister
Honestly, what the hell am I doing here?
always go wrong
Hello freak, I 'm looking for Inspector Lestrade
why ?
he invited me
Why? I think he wants me to see
Well you know what I think? Of course Sally

I know you didn 't even come home yesterday
I didn 't . . . who is this?
my colleague dr watson
Dr Watson Sally Officer Donovan
old friend
Colleague? You have a colleague?
Will he follow you home?
Wouldn 't it be better if I went out and waited... don 't

Here comes the freak and I take him in
Ah Anderson meet again
This is a crime scene, don 't contaminate it
do you understand ?
understand very well
Has your wife been home for a long time?
Don 't pretend it 's your reasoning
someone tell you
what your deodorant told me
my deodorant ?
for men
Of course, the ones I spray are for men, of course.
Same as the one on Officer Donovan
The smell suddenly disappeared. Can I come in?
listen whatever you 're implying . . .
i didn 't say anything i believe sally just
come to chat with you and spend the night by the way
I guess she wiped the ground for you and saw it from her knee
you gotta wear one of this
who is this ?
my people
But who is he? I said he was mine
don 't you wear one?
Where is the scene? Upstairs
I 'll give you two minutes
Maybe a little longer
The credit card says her name is Jennifer Winson we are using it to find the exact contact address
The corpse is not here soon
found by kids
shut up i didn 't say anything
You are disturbing me thinking
( left handed )
( RACHE German noun revenge )
( Name: Rachel )
( wet )
(dry)
( wet )
( clean )
( clean )
( clean )
( dirty )
(Unhappy marriage:
10+ years)
( clean )
(one side clean and one dirty)
( take off often )
( multiple adultery )
Did you find anything?
Unreasonable
she is german

RACHE means revenge in German
what is she trying to tell us
Thank you for your participation
So she 's German? Of course not
(next 7 days weather forecast) she is from out of town
she 's ready to go back to Cardiff
One night in London it 's obvious
Sorry for the obvious?
So what is this information?
Doctor Watson, what do you think?
information ?
It 's a corpse, you study medicine
We have a whole team outside
they don 't work for me
I did everything possible to get you here
yes . . . because you need me
yes i need
God bless
Doctor Watson?
please do as he said
Anderson asked everyone to leave for a few minutes
All right? What am I doing here?
help me clear my mind I just want to
It 's a lot more fun to share your rent
Interesting? A woman is lying here dead
The analysis is accurate but I hope you dig a little deeper
All right
Probably suffocated to death, passed out
stuffed with own vomit
no alcohol smell
It should be a sudden onset, possibly a drug
you know what 's going on you read the paper
She was one of the suicides 4th
Sherlock, what did you say you found in two minutes?
Victims nearly 30 years old
Judging from her dress, I guess she 's from the media
wearing bright pink
She 's coming from Cardiff to stay for the night from the size of the box
box? box yes
She 's been married for at least 10 years but not happy
She had a string of lovers but no one knew she was married
For God 's sake you 're saying it smoothly
Her wedding ring is at least 10 years old
Her other accessories are very clean except for the wedding ring, this is her marriage history
The inside is brighter than the outside, which means that it is often removed.
Wipe only once when she takes it off
Not looking at her nails for work
She doesn 't work with her hands, so why is she taking off her wedding ring?
Not just one lover, she can 't pretend to be single for that long, so it 's more likely to have a long list of people

Sorry Cardiff ?
Obvious isn 't it?
It 's not obvious to me
God, what the hell is going on in your little brains, it must be boring. Look at her coat.
A little bit of wetness must have been torrential rain in the last few hours. London hasn 't rained for a while.
The back of the collar is also wet
She turned it upside down to keep out the rain
She has an umbrella in her pocket but it 's dry and never used
Not only the wind is strong enough to hold an umbrella
From her suitcase she was ready to spend the night but her journey didn 't take more than two or three hours
because the coat is still dry
So where is there just a heavy rain and strong wind and within two or three hours of journey ?
Cardiff
Great, you know what you said out loud?
sorry if i shut up . . relationship
Why do you keep saying suitcases?
yes where is it ?
There must be something on the phone or in a notepad
Look for Rachel, she wrote Rachel?
No, she left an angry last note in German, of course she wrote Rachel, it couldn 't have been any other word.
The question is why wait until death to write?
How do you know she has a box?
She has mud marks on her right heel and calf but not on the left
From the pattern of the mud dots it can be seen that she is pulling a box with wheels in her right hand
In terms of the distribution of mud points, it is a slightly smaller box
Such a small suitcase is only enough for one night for such a well-dressed lady so I know she only takes one night
Where is it and what have you done with it?
no boxes here
Say it again
There are no boxes at all here
box anyone found a box
Are there any boxes in the house?
sir, there is no box here
But they took the poison and swallowed the medicine
This is obviously how you can 't find it
ok thanks for that . . .
All cases are murders I don 't know how
They 're not suicides, they 're serial murders
we 're looking for a serial killer
That 's great, I 'm looking forward to it
Why do you say that?
Where 's her suitcase, please, her suitcase?
Did she eat it herself? Someone else took her suitcase at the scene
So the killer must have driven here
Forgot the box in the car
She may have already booked the hotel and put it in there.
I didn 't go to the hotel to see her hair
Lipstick and shoes are the same color
She couldn 't have left the hotel if her hair was still so . . .

Sherlock? What 's wrong?
Serial killers are always hard to deal with
have to wait for their own mistakes
We can 't wait!
Don 't wait any longer to see how she looks
Headquarters mistakenly found to investigate the Cardiff side
Go to Jennifer Wilson 's family and friends
go to rachel
Sure, but what 's wrong?
pink
hurry up and get to work . . .

he 's gone
Who? Sherlock? Holmes ?
Yeah he 's gone like that he 's always like that
Will he come back? It seems not
All right
All right. . .

Excuse me where am I now?
blackston
Do you know where to take a taxi?
Because . . . uh. . . my legs
Take a taxi on the main road
thanks
but you are not his friend
he has no friends at all
then who are you ?
I . . . I 'm nobody I just met him
Well then I suggest you stay away from him
why ?
Do you know why he is here?
no pay nothing
He likes the kind of scene that gets him excited
The weirder the crime, the more excited he gets, you know?

One day the detective will not be able to satisfy him
One day we 'll be surrounded by a corpse, Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes is the initiator
Why do that?
because he 's psychotic
Psychopaths are easily bored
Donovan is here
away from Sherlock Sherlock Holmes



taxi taxi . . .





Hey ?
There 's a surveillance camera in the building on your left
see it ?
Who are you ?
who ?
See the camera, Dr. Watson?
yes i saw it. . . .
Did you see another camera on the building across the street?

The last one on the top floor of the building on your right

how did you do it ?
Get on Dr. Watson
I could have threatened you but you must know your situation
hello hi
What is your name ?
uh . . . Anthea
Is that your real name? No
my name is john
I know
I have to ask where is this going?
unnecessary
John
All right
sit down john
you know i have a cell phone
The camera trick is great but . . . just call me
to my phone
To avoid Sherlock Sherlock Holmes ' eyes should learn to be cautious, so we meet here
Your legs must be sore, sit down
i don 't want to sit down
you 're not so afraid
you 're not too scary
That 's right . . .
bravery of soldiers
Bravery is the best word for stupidity, what do you say?
you and sherlock What about Sherlock Holmes?
It 's alright, we barely know each other, I just met him yesterday
You two lived together in just one day, and now you 're still investigating the case together
Shouldn 't something good be approaching this weekend?
Who are you? Stakeholders
To Sherlock? Why?
I guess you are not friends
You 've met him too. How many friends do you think he has?
I 'm the closest friend Sherlock can have, what do you mean?
Enemy Enemy?
To him I 'm definitely the enemy
If you ask him he 'll say I 'm his devil
He likes to dramatize things
yo thank god you don 't have that problem

(Come to Baker Street if it 's convenient - Xia Fu) I didn 't bother you
didn 't bother at all
Are you going to continue with Sherlock? Sherlock Holmes to continue cooperation ?
Maybe it 's wrong . . . but I don 't think it 's your business
It 's hard to say it 's none of your business
If you do move in . . . 221B Baker Street
I will be more than happy to pay you handsomely on a regular basis
why ?
because you are not rich
What is the quid pro quo?
provide information
Never infringe on privacy Never embarrass you
Just tell me what he 's doing why?
I always worry about him
you are so nice
But for various reasons I hope you 're tight-lipped about this. Our relationship is a little... not very friendly.

(If it is inconvenient, also come - Xia Fu)
No, I haven 't said the exact amount yet.
Save it
I fell for him so soon.
No no I 'm just not interested
'Don 't Trust People' by Doctor
what is that ?
You don 't trust anyone else but you trust Sherlock? Holmes ?
Who said I trusted him?
You 're not like the kind of person who gets along easily
Are you finished?
what do you say
I guess someone warned you to stay away from him but I see you left hand you won 't do it
my what? show me
don 't touch
What 's so amazing?
Most of the people in this city are mediocre
In the eyes, there are only bustling streets, cars and people coming and going
with Sherlock Sherlock Holmes walks with you but you can see the battlefield
You have already experienced it, haven 't you?
what happened to my hand?
Your left hand is shaking intermittently
Your doctor thinks it 's PTSD
She thinks you 're haunted by memories of the war
who are you ?
How did you know ?
Fire her, she 's going in the wrong direction
You 're under pressure now but your hands are rock solid
You are not plagued by war Dr. Watson . . .
you miss war
Welcome back

It 's time for Dr. Watson.
i take you home
(Possibly Dangerous - Xia Fu)
address ?
Baker Street
221B Baker Street
But I need to go somewhere first
listen to your boss
Can you stop telling him I 've been here?
Of course you already told him?
That 's right
Uh . . . do you usually have free time?
Of course more
goodbye ok

what are you doing ?
Nicotine patch (for smoking cessation)
can help me think
It 's hard to be a smoker in London these days
Bad brain functioning
good for breathing
Breathing is boring
Do you post three videos at once?
It 's a three-level puzzle
How ?
You let me come quickly I thought it was important
Oh of course can I borrow your cell phone?
My phone? Not my own
The number is likely to be recognized on my website
Mrs Hudson has a cell phone and she 's downstairs
I tried yelling but she 's deaf
I 'm on the other side of London City . . .
not urgent
for you. . .
What to do? This case?
her box . . her box ?
her suitcase of course
Murderer took her suitcase first big mistake
Well he took her suitcase so what?
Useless no choice but to take risks
I have a number on my desk, send me a text message
You called me here just to . . send a text message
That 's right, the texting number is on my desk
what happened? just met a friend of yours
friend? enemy
oh which one ?
According to him, it is your demon king who will really have a demon king?
Did he pay you to spy on me?
That 's right, did you get it?
no
It 's a shame we could have split evenly and figured it out next time
Who is he? The most dangerous man you 've ever met, but the problem isn 't him
texting number on my desk
Jennifer. wilson this is . . .
Wait isn 't this the victim?
Yes, it doesn 't matter. Enter the number.
Are you entering numbers? Yes
Are you done losing?
yes . . . wait a minute
Literally as I say
'What happened to Lauriston Gardens?'
'I must have passed out'
' 22 Northumberland Street ' ' Please come quickly ' You passed out ?
What? No of course not
Hurry up and send it out

Has it been sent? What is the address?
2 2 Northumberland Street Express
(What happened to Lauriston Gardens? I must have passed out)
( 22 Northumberland Street please come quickly )
That is. . .
The Pink Lady 's Box Jennifer Wilson 's Box
yes obviously
Maybe explain that I didn 't kill her
I didn 't say you killed her why didn 't you?
I sent that text message and her box
It 's completely logical to think so, and people often think you 're a murderer?
yes every now and then
All right. . .
How did you get this? Found it
where ?
The killer must have taken her to Lauriston Gardens
The box was left in the car so it was in his hands
Anyone who takes this box will be noticeable, especially men. According to statistics, the murderer is probably a man.
So he desperately wanted to throw it away
It took less than five minutes to realize I was a mistake when I found myself carrying the box
I checked every drop of bulky items within a five-minute drive around Lauriston Gardens
unobtrusive alley
Found it in less than an hour
Pink can be deduced so much just by the fact that the box is pink?
It must be obvious in pink
Why didn 't I guess?
because you 're a fool
No, don 't look that way, almost everyone is
Listen, did you notice anything missing?
In the box? How do I know?
her cell phone where is her cell phone?
The corpse and the box have no mobile phone
She has a cell phone and just texted
maybe forgot at home
She has a lot of lovers and must be very careful
She never leaves her phone at home

Why am I sending that text message?
The question is where is her phone now?
Maybe it 's lost, right?
The murderer . . . you think the murderer took the phone?
Maybe she dropped her phone while putting the box away
Maybe the killer took the phone for some reason
The phone is probably in the murderer 's hands anyway
Excuse me . . . what are we doing? I just texted the killer? What 's the use of that?


Just hours after the murder, the murderer received a text message that could only be from the deceased
People who stumble upon the phone will ignore such text messages but the murderer . . . will panic
Did you speak to the police?
4 dead people don 't have that time
Then why tell me?
Mrs Hudson confiscated my skull
So I 'm replacing your skull?
Don 't worry, you did a good job
Okay what?
you can sit here and watch tv
Do you want me to go with it?
I like to go out and have someone to accompany talking loudly to help thinking
Skull is too ostentatious to go out so...

Questions? Yes Officer Donovan
What 's up with her ?
She said . . . murders make you happy

I said 'dangerous' and you 're here
The death
Where are we going?
Five minutes walk to Northumberland Street
Would the murderer be stupid enough to go there?
No, I think he 's very smart
Smart people I like so much I 'd love to get caught
Why? Appreciated
Being sought after and finally becoming the focus
That 's the underbelly of genius, they need an audience
That 's right
This is the center of his hunting ground city
It 's different now knowing that the victim was kidnapped by him
Victims disappear from busy streets and no one notices them leaving
Who can we trust even though we don 't know each other?
Who goes unnoticed wherever they go?
Who hunts in the crowd ?
I don 't know who?
Didn 't think you were hungry at all?
thank you billy
22 Northumberland Street
stare at it
He won 't go up and ring the doorbell, he 's crazy
He has killed 4 people
All right
Sherlock !
Anything on the menu is free
On our account you and your lover are both
Do you want something to eat? I 'm not his lover
This man cleared me of murder
This is Angelo I proved to Lestrade 3 years ago
Angelo was in the middle of a burglary on the other side of the city when a brutal triple murder occurred.
He cleaned my name
A little bit, is there any movement on the other side?
nothing
If it wasn 't for him I 'd go to jail
You ended up in jail anyway
I 'll light you candles to be more romantic
I 'm not his lover
You 'd better have some, we might have to wait a long time
thanks a lot
There is no devil
what? in real life
There is no devil in real life
No? It 's tedious
So who did I meet?
So what should a normal person have in 'real life'?
friend ?
The people they know like the people they don 't like . . .
girlfriend boyfriend
You 're right about me being boring
So you don 't have a girlfriend
Girlfriend? Not my thing

Oh, that 's how it is
So do you have a boyfriend? By the way, that 's okay
I know it 's okay
So you have a boyfriend? No
Alright alright
You 're as free as I am
very good
John hmmm . . .
I guess I should tell you that I think of my job as a lover even though I 'm flattered I really don 't want anything . . .
Do not
I 'm not testing no
I just said it doesn 't matter
very good
thanks
Look across the street, a taxi has stopped
No one goes in, no one comes out
Why a taxi ?
Are you really smart?
Why? That 's him
don 't stare
you 're staring
Can 't we both stare at each other?

Feel sorry
I wrote down the license plate number you used
Right-turn one-way road construction Traffic lights
(alternate road)
Feel sorry
(Prohibited) (Road closure)
john fast
Please wait
Come on, John can 't catch up
( Road closure )
here
Not here!
Feel sorry
( End of Pedestrian Street )
(Prohibited)
( give way )
Police! Open the door

wrong
Teeth dark skinned Californian ?
Los Angeles Santa Monica just arrived
How did you know? Luggage
First time in London?
Depending on your destination and the way the driver takes you around
Excuse me, are you the police?
Is everything going well?
right
welcome to london
Please notify us if you encounter any problems
It 's just a taxi that happened to slow down anyway.
not a murderer not a murderer no
Alien strong alibi
Invulnerable, where did you get this?
Inspector Lestrade? Yes
When he annoys me, I steal from him
Keep this, I have it in my room
What? Nothing but . . . 'Welcome to London'

Are you out of breath? Waiting for your order
All right. . .
ridiculous
This is the most ridiculous thing I 've ever done
You also invaded Afghanistan

I 'm not alone
Why don 't we go back to the restaurant?
they will monitor
I wasn 't sure anyway.
So what are we going to do?
Oh pass the time
and prove one thing
Prove what? you
Mrs. Hudson, Dr. Watson wants the upstairs room.
Who said that ?
What the guy at the door said

Sherlock texted me saying you dropped this

uh thanks
Thank you
Sherlock, what are you doing?
Mrs Hudson? Upstairs
what are you doing ?
I know you 'll find the box I 'm not stupid
you can 't break into my house
You can 't seize exhibits and I 'm not trespassing
Oh what is this called?
It 's anti-drug
What can this guy be a poisonous insect?
do you know him? john
In my opinion, you can spend the day here without trying to find anything to entertain.
John suggests you shut up now please
why no ?
you? shut up i 'm not your search dog
Andersen is my search dog
Anderson, what are you doing here?
oh i voluntarily
They 're both, and they 're not in the Drug Enforcement Division.
But very enthusiastic
This is a human eyeball, put it back
In the microwave, it 's a science experiment
Then find the guys
Or if you help us, I 'll close the team
How naive to deal with children
Sherlock this is our case
I let you in but you can 't go it alone
clear ?
What - you 're blackmailing me by pretending to be a drug dealer?
It 's not like I 'm pretending I 'm innocent if I find drugs
Your apartment is . . . all clean?
don 't even smoke
I don 't smoke either
Well let 's work together
Found Rachel. Who is she?
Jennifer. Winson 's only daughter
her daughter ?
Why did she write her daughter 's name?
Forget it, the box is found
Someone once asserted that the box was with the murderer and now it 's in the hands of our dear mentally ill
I 'm not a psychopath, I 'm a high functioning sociopath
Please be professional
You gotta get Rachel to interrogate her, I gotta ask her too
She died too good time and place why ?
Is there a connection? Surely
I can 't say she 's been dead for 14 years
Strictly never lived
Rachel is Jennifer Vinson 's aborted daughter 14 years ago
No this . . . how could this be wrong . . . why did she do it?


Why did she miss her daughter before she died?
Yeah, it 's a real anti-social disease
she doesn 't want her daughter
It 's to carve your name on the ground with your fingernails
she 's dying
It 's exhausting and painful
You said that the victims were taking their own medicines and that he forced them, uh maybe he . . . told them something
Maybe took advantage of her daughter 's death
Yes, but she 's still depressed after all these years.
right?
is not right
If you 're going to die and get murdered
What will you say at the end of your life?
' Oh God, help me '
use your imagination
I do not need
yes you can assume you are smart
Jennifer has so many lovers she is absolutely smart
what is she telling us
Is the doorbell broken? Sherlock is coming from the car you ordered
I didn 't call a taxi to go away
Ouch, what are you looking for in such a mess?
This is Mrs. Hudson
But this is the herbal remedy for my back pain. . .
All shut up, don 't move, don 't talk, don 't breathe
I 'm thinking, Anderson turned around, you 're so dazzling
what my face ?
give me silence
Anderson turned to God
Turn around now, thank you
Come on, think about it, what about the car?
mrs hudson


she 's smart
She 's smarter than you all and she 's dead
do you understand ?
The phone is not lost, not lost at all
She fell for the murderer
She expected to die when she got out of the car
She left her phone to track down the killer
How to track ?
What is how to track?
Rachel
Still not understanding? Rachel
Look at you bunch of scumbags
I don 't feel good, do I? How relaxing
Rachel is not a name
what is that ?
John has a tag on his luggage
e-mail
j e n n i e . p i n k @ m e p h o n e . o r g . u k
She doesn 't have a computer, so she must be working on her phone
Smartphone-bound email
There is a website to log into her account
The username is the email address. Guess the password?
Rachel
We can read her email so what?
Anderson don 't shout
The IQ of the whole street has been lowered by you
More than just mail, it 's a smartphone with satellite positioning
That is to say, if it is lost, it can be traced online.
She 's going to bring us to the murderer
Unless he threw we know he didn 't
come on, come on
Sherlock 's dear taxi driver . . .
Mrs Hudson, should you take your medicine tonight?
shunting helicopter
Phone batteries are limited
Only the map doesn 't have the killer 's name
This is the breakthrough
Sherlock, at least not the whole city is suspect.
This is our first reliable clue, Sherlock.
Where to say where?
Here at 221 Baker Street
how come here ?
how come ?
Maybe in the box you brought back . . .
It fell out and I haven 't found it yet? I-- didn 't find it?
Anyway, he returned our text messages.
Watched for a cell phone victim in this building . . .
Who can we trust even though we don 't know each other?
( London Taxi Driver 7 1 1 2 6 )
Who goes unnoticed wherever they go?
Who hunts in the crowd ?

( follow me )
Sherlock, are you alright? . . .

yes it 's alright to me
Why is the phone here?
do not know
I will try again good idea
where are you going ?
Go out for a breath, go for a while and come back soon

Are you really all right? I 'm fine
Sherlock sherlock holmes car
I didn 't call a taxi
but you don 't necessarily need
you are that taxi driver
Parked outside Northumberland Street
that 's you not a passenger
You see no one thinks of a taxi driver
like transparent people
forever left behind
Great for serial killers
Did you plead guilty? Oh sure
tell you something more
If you call the police now, I won 't run away
I 'll just sit tight and catch me, I promise
why ?
Because you can 't, can 't I?
I didn 't kill those four Mr. Holmes
I chatted with them and they cut themselves off
If you call the police now, I promise one thing
i will never tell you what i said
But no one 's going to die anymore, and I 'm sure they 'll be able to close the case too.
You never know how they died
What kind of closure do you want?
What should I do if I want the truth? I 'll give you a ride

To kill me too?
I didn 't mean to kill you Mr. Holmes
I just want to talk to you and you just cut it off


He got into a cab. It was Sherlock. He took the cab and left.
I 'd say he 's that kind of guy
he ran away again
we are wasting time
I tried to ring the phone



If the bell rings, it 's not here
I will try again
Does it matter? Is it interesting?

He 's a lunatic and will always let you down
You 're wasting time everyone 's time
ok guys call it a day
how did you find me ?
oh i recognized you
when you chased my car
Sherlock Sherlock Holmes
I was warned against you
I 've also been on your site it 's really nice I like it

Who warned you? Someone who noticed you
Who ?
Who will notice me?
You are so humble Mr. Holmes
I didn 't
you have a fan
tell me
just tell you this
in this life
What is he doing, what is he running?
you know him better than me
I 've known him for 5 years no I don 't know him
Then why are you putting up with him?
I 'm a dead horse as a living horse doctor
Also because of Sherlock Sherlock Holmes was a great man and I think one day if we all get lucky he might be a good man too
where are we ?
you know the streets of london you know where it is
Roland Kerr College
Why are you here? The door is open
cleaners cleaning
One of the features of driving a taxi is that you always know where there is a secluded place for murder.
I really don 't understand why my peers don 't try
The victim just walked in with you? Why?
Really boring
Don 't worry about the good show coming
You can 't force people to kill themselves with a gun. I don 't have one.

so much better than that
No need for you because you will follow me


what do you think ?
You decide
You 're going to die here after all
I don 't they all say that
let 's talk
Wouldn 't this be a little risky?
Take me away under the nose of a bunch of cops
They 're not that stupid
Mrs Hudson will remember you too
You call this a risk?
That 's called risk
I love this part
Because you still don 't understand, do you?
I understand right away
As soon as I take this out . . .
Did you not expect this?
Guarantee you like this
what do you like ?
Sherlock sherlock holmes look at you
It 's really you, your website, your fans told me
my fans ?
you are really great
you are a genius
'Deductive Studies' I say this . . .
thinking
Why don 't you and I talk privately about why people don 't think?
Are you going crazy too?
Why can 't they think?
Oh, I see that you are also a genius
Doesn 't look like it, right?
little old man who drives a rental
But you 'll wake up soon
This might be the last thing you know in your life
Well two bottles explained
A good bottle a bad bottle
Take the medicine in a good bottle and you will live
Eat the medicine in the bad bottle and you 'll die
The two bottles are the same, right?
but you can tell
of course i can
but i don 't know
You know it 's not fun, you choose
Why should I? No reason what can I win?
I haven 't told you the best thing yet
no matter which bottle you choose
I have another bottle of medicine
Then we both... took the medicine
I won 't cheat it 's your choice
I 'll take the rest of your medicine
You didn 't expect this, Mr. Holmes?
That 's what you did to them to give them choices? Now I 'll give you

don 't worry
clear your mind
Bring out your best strategy
It 's not a strategy it 's a 5 0 : 5 0 probability
I 've played four games and I 'm still alive
it 's not probability mr holmes it 's chess
This is a game of chess, only one move and only one side can survive
And this . . . is the only step
Did I just give you a good bottle or a bad bottle?
choose one
I have something to say to Inspector Lestrade.
very important
Turn left here thanks
Are you ready, Mr. Holmes?
Start playing?
What to play? It 's a 5 0 : 5 0 probability
You 're not betting on numbers, it 's me
Did I just give you a good drug or a bad drug?
Is this a scam or anti-fraud?
Or triple anti-fraud? Still just probabilities
Four people in a row? It 's not a probability
luck is genius
I know what people think
I know what people think I think
I have a map in my head
Everyone is so stupid, even you
Or God just bless me
Either way, you 're a waste of rent.
so
Why did you risk your life to kill a few passersby four times?
the game starts
oh i 'm playing
it 's my turn
You have shaving foam behind your left ear
no one reminds you
From the traces more than once it is clear that you live alone and no one reminds you
but you have pictures of children
child mother cut off
If she died she would still be here
The photo is old but the frame is new
You miss your kids but can 't go to see them
estranged father
She took the children and you still love them and suffer for it
Ah, it 's more than that
your clothes have just been washed
But every item of clothing on your body has been at least . . . for three years?
Keeping the meter without a long-term plan
Now addicted to self-destructive murder why?
That 's when they told you three years ago?
tell me what? (near death)
Said you were dying and you were too
But you 're running out of time
Am i right ?
Aneurysm is here
Every breath may be the last
 'Cause you 're going to die, you kill four people
I survived four people
This is the happiest thing for aneurysm patients
no no other reason
You didn 't kill four people out of anger
Anger is a narcotic
A more dangerous motive is love
I don 't know why this is for your kids

You are really good, aren 't you? Why?
I 'm dead and my kids get nothing
renting for no money
Serial killings are the same thing, you 're out of luck
tell me the story
i have a sponsor
what do you have ?
The kids get money for every life I take
The more I kill them the better
You see it 's more cost-effective than you think
Who would sponsor a serial killer?
Who is infatuated with Sherlock? Holmes ?
You 're not the only one who appreciates good murder
There are others like you in the world, but you are alone
And they are far more than that
You mean . . more than one person ?
an organization? what?
There 's a name no one ever mentions
I won 't say
Enough of gossip
time to choose
Sherlock
Sherlock
What if I don 't choose either? I can just walk away
Either you bet 5 0 : 5 0 or I shoot you in the head
It 's funny that no one ever chose this
I choose gun thank you
Are you sure ?
determine the gun
You don 't want to call a friend?
gun
I can tell if the gun is real or not
They can 't see clearly
ok this game is fun
Looking forward to seeing you in court
Before you go, ask if you have come up with it?
Which is a good bottle?
Of course a piece of cake
Well which one ?
Which one would you choose?
let me know if i will win you
bring it on
finish the game

interesting
What do you think?
eat together ?
Really what do you think?
Can you beat me?
Are you smart enough to risk your life?
Sherlock
I bet you 're always bored, right?
I know you will
People like you are so smart
But what 's the use of being so smart if you can 't prove it?
still an addict
But this . . . is your real addiction
You will do whatever it takes to get rid of boredom
You are not bored now, are you?
It is not good ?

Am i right ?
I got it right, didn 't I?
Did I choose the right one?
ok tell me
Who is your sponsor?
Tell you about my people my fans
give me a name
Do not
You 're dying, but there 's still time to torture you
give me a name

name fast
name
Moriarty

Why give me a blanket? They keep throwing blankets on me
I 'm not stimulated to appease irritated people
Well some people need to take pictures
There 's no trace of the shooter?
Run away before we arrive
But it 's normal for that kind of person to have enemies.
Maybe someone is following him but . . . we have no clue
oh i don 't think
Okay, let 's hear it
The bullet dug out of the wall was from a pistol
We 're looking for a sharpshooter with a shot from this distance.
More than good marksmanship, he 's a fighter
His hands didn 't shake at all, so he was familiar with violence
But I didn 't shoot until my life was on the line, showing a strong sense of morality
You 're looking for someone who has probably served in the military and is... poised and tough as steel. . .
Forget it, I said leave me alone
what? don 't listen to me
That 's . . . stimulated to talk nonsense
where are you going ?
I have to talk . . . rent
I still have something to ask you, what 's the matter?
I 'm so excited I 'm wearing a blanket
Sherlock
And I just caught you a serial killer . . .
Well, I 'll find you tomorrow, let 's go
Officer Donovan . . . explains what happened
Those two pills . . .
Really sinister, right? Really sinister
good marksmanship
Yeah, it 's definitely hard to be across the window
Well you know best
Gotta get the gunpowder burn off your hands
Probably won 't sentence you, but we 'd better not go to court
Are you alright? Of course I 'm alright
You just killed someone right . . .
Is it true?
But he 's not a good guy
Not a good guy for him
What a fucking driver
that he can 't drive at all
You should have seen the way he drove around
We can 't laugh that this is a murder scene, stop talking
Hey, you 're a murderer, be quiet
sorry i 'm a little . . . hypersorry

You really plan to take that pill, right?
I don 't have it
I was procrastinating to know you would come
how do you know
That 's how you find excitement, right? Bet your life to prove you are smart
Why am I?
because you 're a fool
Food? I 'm starving
Baker Street has a nice Chinese restaurant open until 2am
The quality of a Chinese restaurant depends on the bottom 1/3 of the doorknob
Sherlock is the one I told you about
I know very well who he is
Okay, another case solved
It 's a blessing to the public
But that was never your motive, was it?
What are you doing here?
I 'll take care of you as usual
I heard about your 'concern'
Still so awkward
Haven 't you thought that I and you are in the same camp?
strange no
We have more in common than you 'd like to believe
It 's so childish for us to fight.
It always hurts the innocent, you know it makes mommy angry
I made my mother angry?
I ?
It wasn 't me Mycroft who messed with her.
hey wait a minute
Mom? Who is Mom?
mother our mother
This is my brother Mycroft
Are you gaining weight again?
sorry for the reduction
Is he your brother?
Of course he 's my brother
Then he is not . . . not what?
I don 't know the underground conspirators?
almost oh my god
I 'm just a tiny member of the British government
He 's the British government when he 's not busy being the British intelligence agency or making cameos in the CIA.
good evening mycroft
Please try not to start a war until I get home You know what the traffic will be like
So you really care about him when you say you care about him?
yes of course
I said this is really a child 's anger?
He 's always so puffed up
Can you imagine what our Christmas dinner would be like?
God, can 't

I am still. . .
meet again
hello we met this evening

oh ok good night
good night dr watson
go eat dim sum
I can always guess the words in the fortune cookie blow you
You can almost say you 've still been shot, right?
What? Was really wounded in Afghanistan
Oh shoulders shoulders I know

Blame the left
You 're right, I 'm never blind
you are blind
What are you excited about? Moriarty
What Moriarty ?
i don 't know
Sir, are you leaving?
It 's fun being a soldier
He may be my brother 's savior . . . or make him even more hopeless
Raise their surveillance level anyway.
Start tertiary surveillance
Sorry sir, whose surveillance level?
Sherlock sherlock holmes and dr watson
