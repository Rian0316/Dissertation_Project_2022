Almost instantaneous death can be assumed A lmostinstantaneousdea th , presumably .
Straight through the heart M m , straight through thehea rt .
The bullet is still in T hebullet  ' sstillthere .
What about the bullet that wounded Mrs. Cupid?
W h a t   a b o u t   t h e   b u l l e t   t h a t   w o u n d e d   M r s .   C u b i t t ?
Still in her T hat  ' sstillinher , aswell . It takes someone more flexible than me to get it out I twilltakehandsmorenim blethanminetomoveit .
Is this Mrs Cupid 's tote bag?
Is this Mrs. C ubitt  ' shandbag ? Yes Mr. Holmes Yes , itis , Mr .
H olmes . At least 20 50 pound notes A tleasttwenty 50 - poundnotes , abribethat failed .
It appears that two shots were fired S o , two bulletsfired ,
One death and one injury, what you said is true, twowoundsinflicted, asyousaid.
Yes Doctor Yes , Doctor . So how are you going to explain The henhow do you account for the bullet that apparently hit the window frame ? that hassoobviously str uck the window frame ?
I can 't imagine how you saw that?
By George , howeverdidyouseethat ? ! Because I came to Dr. Cahue B ecause , D r .
C a r t h e w ,   I   l o o k e d   f o r   i t .
That 's too powerful, why is that bullet still in there? W onderful , why , thebullet  ' sstillthere !
So say a total of three shots were fired S oa third shot must havebe enfired .
That is to say, there was a third person present at that time.Whichmeansthatathirdpe rsonmusthavebeenprese nt .
Not at all Exactly ! You entered this room last night When you cameintothisroo mlastnight , did you see the door a little open and the window open? yousaythatthedoorwasa jar ;wasnotthatwindowalsoo pen ?

i don 't know sir i think i don  ' tknow , sir .
Not Mr. No , sir .
It is closed I twasshut . Saunders , willyou and C ookwaitinthelibrary , will you go to the study with the cook and wait
And you walker andyou , Walker . Dr. Kahue you can remove the body Dr .
C a r t h e w ,   y o u   m a y   r e m o v e   t h e   b o d y .
It seems that Mrs. Cupid closed the window I twas Mrs.
C ubittherselfwhoshutth atwindow . If Sanders and the cook were upstairs and smelled gunpowder I f S aunders and the Cooksmelledsmokeandgun powderupstairs ,then there must havebeen a strongthroughdraft .
Otherwise it wouldn 't be so fast O therwise , it wouldn 't have spreads oquickly
It went upstairs through thehouse. We know that the door is open We eknowthatdoorwasopen, then that window must also be open thatwindow, too, must alsohavebeenopen,
But only for a while butonlyforashorttime. Why do you say only for a while?
W h y   o n l y   f o r   a   s h o r t   t i m e ?
Because the candle has not melted the edge B ecausethecandleshaven otgutted.
Otherwise, T hereisnotrailofwax will shed tears.
Wonderful Wonderful , wonderful !
If the shot fired by Mr. Cupid I fthelate Mr. Hilton C ubitt had hit the window frame during his lifetime,
Then he must be aiming at hemusthavebeenaiminga t
someone who is standing either inside
Or just outside the window or just outside the wind .
Thank you Inspector Oh , thankyou , Inspector . That is the bullet that killed Mr. Cupid Which means that thebulle twhich killed Mr r .
C ubitt could have been . . . could havebeenfiredby - Inspector We really see the same heroes Inspector , your thoughts and mine ag reeentirely .
This is the bullet of the bullet which killed Mr Hilton Cupid.
H i l t o n   C u b i t t .
Holmes, if three shots were fired, why did Mrs. King and Sanders only hear two shots? Whydid Mrs.
K ingand S aundersonlyheartwosho ts ? They told the truth but they didn 't realize it was a lie
I can 't understand it a bit I  ' mnotsure that I follow you .
Do you remember what Mrs. King said about Yourememberwhat Mrs.
