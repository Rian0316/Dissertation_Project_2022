 Why are you wearing a Band- Aid ?
 Halley bit me .
 ( laughs ) You got beaten up by a girl . Hey , that 's sexist .

 You 're right .
 ( laughs ) You got beaten up by a
 Hi .
 Hey . Hey .
 What you got there ? Oh , I grabbed a sandwich at the food truck out front .
 Wait , n- now , hold on .
 Tonight is Friday , and I believe you know what that means .
 That my fun , young life took a drastic turn somewhere ?
 No .
 But yeah .
 No , that means it 's Chinese food night .
 Yeah , and you have Chinese food .
 So eat it . But I can smell your pastrami .
 And we can all hear your complaining , so no one 's happy .
 It does smell good .
 Oh , it is . I had one the other day .
 ( stammers ) What is happening ? Everybody 's supposed to be eating Chinese food .
 Well , actually , I believe the Chinese may have invented the sandwich .
 Their dish " rou jia mo " literally means
 " meat between bread . "
 So , it looks like all of us , including Penny , are eating Chinese food .
 Except for you , Sheldon . You 're eating crow .
 I 'm sorry , I think you 're forgetting that the sandwich was invented by John Montagu , the Earl of Sandwich .
 Oh . The truck 's called " Pearl of Sandwich . "
 Now I get it .
 All right , that smells too good . I got to get one of those .
 And I think you 're forgetting that there are written documents of meat between bread being eaten in China during the Tang dynasty .
 You know what , I 'll go with you . And then maybe we just go home .
 I think you 're defining bread very loosely .
 If we go down that road , where does it end ?
 Well , I would say when we go to bed , but you talk in your sleep .
 I don 't want to get into this with you right now .
 We 'll talk about this when I 'm asleep .
 I don 't want to talk about it when you 're asleep .
 How come we can 't talk about it now ?
 Well , because I 'm eating now .
 Fine . How 's your moo shu ?
 You know what ?
 It 's great .
 Wait , look at that . Hmm . Well , maybe the Chinese did invent the sandwich .
 I guess you were right .

 I can smell that food truck from up here .
 Just close the window if you don 't like the smell .
 Of course I like the smell .
 It 's salt and fat .
 My brain may be evolved , but my tongue still wants to pick up a club and drag that truck back to my cave .
 So , there 's something you like , but it 's also driving you crazy .
 Been there , doing it now .
 No , it- it 's a distraction .
 How can I focus on my work when all I can think about is how much I want that sandwich ?
 So , go get one .
 I can 't just give in to every urge I have when I have it .
 That 's why I have a rigid schedule .
 It 's bad enough I had to give in to my urge to create a rigid schedule .
 You know , why don 't I just go down to the food truck and ask them to move ?
 Why are you taking cash ?
 No reason .
 Oh , this is the life .
 What could be better than this ? If you weren 't wearing one of my swimsuits .
 I 'll give it back .
 ( chuckles ) You know the rule -- once it touches hiney , it 's no longer miney .
 You 're such a prude .
 Do you know all the things this water 's touching right now ?
 Well , I 'm relaxed enough .
 Hey , Howard , look .
 What 's that ?
 Huh .
 Looks like someone 's drone .
 Oh , no .
 Do you think it was spying on us in the hot tub ?
 ' Cause I 'm only 40 % of the way to my beach bod .
 One of the propellers is broken .
 It must have crashed . Oh .
 Do you think you could fix it ? Maybe .
 Should we try and track down the owner first ?
 Yeah , that 's probably a good idea .
 Anyone lose a drone ?

 Looks like it 's ours . Yay , we got a drone !
 Shh . ( whispers ) :
 Oh .
 Yay , we got a drone .
 ( sighs ) The pastrami truck moved .
 That is the danger of a restaurant on wheels .
 No , apparently someone complained to the tenants association , and they 're not allowed to park on our street anymore .
 Who would complain about something that everyone loves ?
 Oh ... Did you complain to the tenants association about the food truck ?
 Yes .
 And they actually took you seriously ?
 Oh , the tenants association takes every complaint seriously .
 Oh , great , because I 'm about to send them an e- mail complaining about you .
 ( phone chimes )
 Excuse me .
 Wow .
 Someone should have spell- checked .
 What is going on here ?
 You 're the tenants association ? ( laughs ) :
 You should see the look on your face .
 You might want to tell your wife that there 's no " Y " in " pastrami . "
 Okay , that ought to do it .
 I 've replaced the propeller and reattached the gimbal controller unit .
 Dude , you 're like for robots .
 Also , why isn 't that a show ?
 I just need to see if I can re- sync the controls to this old remote .
 We should name it .
 The drone , or your stupid robot show ?
 The drone .
 The show 's already got a name --


 I got it working !
 ( chuckles )
 KOOTHRAPPALl :
 Oh , oh !
 Let 's play William Tell .
 I 'll put this bowl on my head . See if you can knock it off without hitting me .
 You read my mind .
 What are you doing ? Either breaking a bowl or breaking Raj 's head .
 Be careful , they don 't make that bowl anymore .
 ( chuckles ) It 's a nice one .
 Yeah . We found it in the yard and fixed it up .
 Aren 't you worried there 's some kid out there missing his drone ?
 Oh , please , Bernadette , this is not a children 's toy , okay ?
 This thing 's got an HD camera on it .
 Okay , then aren 't you worried there 's some rich Peeping Tom out there missing his drone ?
 We asked around , and no one claimed it .
 Ha .
 I think we 've done all we can do .
 Did you check the video card ?
 Maybe you can see where it started off from . What a great idea , honey .

 So , let me get this straight .
 You are the president of the tenants association ?
 President , only member , and harshest critic .
 I once gave myself an official reprimand for conducting a meeting in the shower .
 The steam warped my gavel .
 Okay , so when I got a fine for leaving my clothes in the dryer for too long , that was from you ? $14 . 99 .
 The exact price of a new gavel .
 And the noise complaint we got for singing you " Happy Birthday " ?
 As a friend , I was touched .
 As a representative of the building ,
 I thought that you should pick a key and stick with it . Hi . Do you know he is the entire tenants association ?
 No , but I 'm not surprised .
 He 's also the pope of a planet he invented in hyperspace .

 Why didn 't you tell me ?
 ' Cause I wanted to make sure that you loved the man , not the office .
 You can 't just declare yourself president .
 I didn 't .
 I called a meeting ,
 I was the only one to attend . I nominated myself , and after a pretty moving speech ,

 I voted myself in .
 Well , if you can vote yourself in , then we can vote you out .
 Yeah .
 Fine .
 Make a motion at the next meeting . When is that ?
 It 's the first Saturday of every month .
 Unless there 's an emergency meeting .
 Then we call an emergency meeting .
 You really don 't have to . This is the first Saturday of the month .
 Okay , fine .
 Then we vote you out .
 Uh , uh , hold on .
 Hold on . First , we have to read the minutes from last month 's meeting .
 Amy , would you do the honors ?
 Why not ?
 " Saturday , March 3rd .
 " 7 : 05 , meeting called to order . " 7 : 06 , president gets shampoo in eye .
 7 : 07 , meeting adjourned . "
 Okay , can we vote you out now ? Ah , very well .
 New business .
 I move for a vote of no confidence in the president .
 Yeah . Two to one , you lose . Not so fast .
 I believe we have one tenant here who has not made her voice heard .
 Oh ...
 We 're waiting , fiancée .
 Yeah , we 're waiting , best friend .
 Yeah , we 're waiting , neighbor who needed a battery and totally got one from me , no strings attached .
 I don 't want to be in the middle of this .
 No matter which way I vote , I 'm either a bad friend , a bad fiancée , or an ungrateful recipient of a battery .
 Next time I have a meeting in the shower , you 're welcome to attend .
 Sheldon .
 Sheldon for president .
 I pick Sheldon !
 Ugh , I can 't believe my best friend sided with Sheldon .
 Can 't believe my best friend Sheldon .
 Ah , I should 've taken that gavel and shoved it right down this throat .
 Ugh .
 I would 've gone the other way , but it would 've gotten to his throat .
 What ?
 Don 't be mad at me .
 I mean , I can 't vote against him . Even when he 's being crazy ?
 Well , what other times are there ? !
 So you just let him get away with anything ?
 Well , not anything .
 But honestly , pastrami sandwich is not the hill I want to die on .
 It 's not about the sandwich .
 It 's about the principle . Yeah , principle .
 And a little bit sandwich . Yeah .
 Look , there are a bunch of other tenants in this building .
 All you need is for one of them to vote your way , and then Sheldon 's out and I didn 't betray him .
 Hey , you know , that 's actually a good plan . That you came up with all by yourself .
 Now , if you 'll excuse me , told Sheldon I was going to the market , so ...
 I 'm taking some of your stuff .

 I was never here .
 Sometimes you don 't see it ' cause she 's next to Sheldon , but she 's pretty weird .
 Okay .
 All hooked up . Here we go .
 I hope there 's nothing disturbing on there .
 Like you two in a hot tub ? Hold on .
 Now I 'm getting a picture .

 That 's not very much to go on .
 Oh , that 's plenty to go on .
 We can 't give up .
 We got to find her .
 You just want to find her 'cause she 's cute .
 Not just because she 's cute .
 She also owns a pretty expensive drone , which means she has money and doesn 't mind wasting it .
 And I ...
 I like that in a woman .
 Do you see anything that could help us locate her ?
 Hmm , let me have a look . She 's got eagle eyes , always spotting continuity errors in movies .
 ( chuckles ) It 's not annoying at all .
 Oh .
 There . Right there .
 Check out the pin on her jacket .
 Isn 't that from the comic book store ?
 Hmm , is it ?
 Hey , Howard , zoom in .
 Oh .
 Fine .
 Zooming in .
 ( whooshes )

 Yeah , I know you 're being a jerk , but it 's actually helpful .
 Hi .
 Hi .
 We 're your neighbors from downstairs . We 've met .
 Remember ?
 I invited you to my housewarming when I moved in .
 Oh , yeah . Sorry .
 You know , it 's been a crazy couple months .
 That was two years ago .
 Welcome to the building .
 Mm- hmm .
 So , I- I 'm running for president of the tenants association .
 I could really use your vote .
 You said you were gonna stop by .
 I bought a lot of food .
 Anyway , meeting 's tomorrow .
 We really hope you can make it .
 I 'll be there . Oh , really ? Yeah .
 You should buy a lot of food .
 So , I 'm running for president of the tenants association and I could really use your vote .
 Uh , who 's president now ?
 Uh , Sheldon Cooper .
 You know , about yay tall and about yay annoying .
 So you want me to vote against Sheldon Cooper ?
 Yeah .
 You just need to show up at a meeting ... Oh , no , no . No can do .
 He 's got a restraining order against me .
 Really ? Why ?
 Uh , I locked him on the roof once .
 ( whispers ) :
 Three times .
 So , Mrs. Petrescu , we were hoping you would vote for Leonard instead of voting for Sheldon .
 Vote Sheldon . No , no .
 Vote Leonard .
 No vote Leonard . No .
 Vote Leonard .
 Thank you .
 She 's wearing a pin from your store .
 Do you know who she is ?
 Oh , sure , yeah . That 's Cynthia .
 Wha ... s- so , she 's a customer ?
 Yeah , yeah , but I- I haven 't seen her in a while .
 And before you say anything , there is a lot of reasons women stop coming here .
 It 's not just me .
 But this time ...
 It was me . Yeah . I was trying out a flirty new smile .
 Now , I don 't use the word
 " ghoulish " a lot , but ...
 I- I just can 't think of another word .
 Wait , do you know how to find her ? Yeah .
 I think I have her address on my mailing list . Oh . Hey .
 Please , let me bring the drone back to her .
 You think you 've got a shot ?
 What if she 's married ?
 She 's not .
 It 's meant to be .
 A little tip .
 Uh , stick with the smiles you know .

 Hi . What are you doing ?
 Leonard and Penny are trying to turn the tenants against me , so they are about to see just what kind of power the president of the tenants association wields .
 " You must be at least this tall to use washing machine " ?
 I 'm gonna hang it up higher than Leonard .
 And then his clothes will smell .
 And nobody 's voting for a man with smelly clothes .
 No , not when there 's a perfectly unscented incumbent on the ballot .
 Sheldon , I have an advanced degree in the study of the human brain , so if my fiancé is a raving lunatic , it 's kind of a ding on my reputation .
 If leaders just stepped aside every time they didn 't have the consent of the governed , what would we have ?
 Democracy .
 Not on my watch .

 Okay . Don 't be weird .
 Don 't be weird .
 Don 't be weird .
 ( deep voice ) : Hello .
 Hey . You found my drone .
 ( normal voice ) :
 Yeah , yeah . Yes . It took a while to track you down , but to see the look on your face , it was worth it .

 Aw , that 's sweet .
 Rajesh .
 Cynthia .
 Ah , pleasure to meet you .
 Likewise .
 I- I feel like I should give you a reward or something .
 Oh , oh , no , you don 't have to do that .
 No , I insist .
 How about your phone number ?
 Give me your phone .
 Thanks .
 So , I 'll- I 'll call you , Cynthia .
 Great , Rajesh . ( both chuckle )
 And thanks again .
 Uh , sure .
 ( phone rings )
 Just checking .
 ( knocking , door opens )
 Hey , Sheldon .
 We found something pretty interesting .
 Huh .
 Well , that is surprising . I , for one , have no idea what they 're talking about .
 Turns out , when Amy took over Penny 's apartment , she was put on the lease , not you .
 Yeah , and when I moved across the hall , you got taken off the lease and I got added .
 PENNY :
 Well , what are you saying ?
 That Sheldon 's not technically a tenant at all and therefore , has no standing to be president of the tenants association no matter who votes for him ?
 I don 't know how you found that out , but I am guessing all on your own .
 So , looks like we need to figure out who the new president should be .
 I nominate myself .
 I second it . Huh .
 Well , as a woman in love , I want to stand by my man .
 Too bad that 's been rendered bureaucratically impossible .
 Well , this is hard for me because I do love a legal technicality and this is a good one .
 Although , not quite as good as the provision in California law , which states a person who occupies a dwelling for 30 consecutive days becomes a tenant at will and as such ...


 I vote for Leonard !
 You ...
 What ? I 'm sorry , Sheldon .
 With minimal power comes minimal responsibility , and you couldn 't handle it .
 Don 't you misquote to me .
 It 's not your fault .
 I mean , what man wouldn 't be seduced by the power to decide how late the laundry room stays open ?
 Wait , you 're the reason I had to come back and get my jeans the next morning ?
 I can 't believe you expect me to give that up .
 Sheldon , it 's the American way , the peaceful transfer of power .
 I don 't know .
 Think about
 I 'm always thinking about
 Michael Douglas had the suit and then he passed it on to Paul Rudd .
 Maybe you 're right .
 Really ?
 The thing ?
 That 's what won you over ?
 Yes . He got the details right .
 That 's how you use a superhero . Mm .
 I suppose it is time I passed this on to Leonard .
 Thank you . Yeah , thanks .
 I- I know that 's hard for you .
 Well , it was . But you know what ?
 Instead of being in charge ,
 I can now be the vocal opposition , criticizing and badgering the president at every turn .
 I think you 'll be really good at that .
 Me , too .
 I think I 've made a huge mistake .
 Me , too .

 Can 't believe you got her number .
 I know , right ?
 How amazing would it be if this worked out and the story of how I met my wife started with you and me in the hot tub together .
 Well , do us both a favor and start the story later .
 Whatever .
 I have a good feeling about this girl . Like , we really hit it off .
 Stop flying it around .
 You 're gonna break it . Why do you care ?
 Because we have to give it back to the beautiful mystery girl .
 Aw . I mean , did you see how hot she was ?
 I want to get all up on that and start making babies !
 I know exactly what underwear
 I 'm gonna wear on our first date .
 None !
