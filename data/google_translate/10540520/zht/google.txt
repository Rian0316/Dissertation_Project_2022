When I found out that wasn 't the case, I made the stone heavier
I 'm so sorry
It was a few years ago
I forgot what was in the letter

Don 't stop parking like this
I don 't understand, there 's no no parking sign there

fuck no
Maybe you need glasses
Maybe you need a better job
I am sorry
we just got married
We 're saving money for our honeymoon, not much savings
Can you accommodate once?
Cash only
please, at least let me get my dad back

Not his corpse, but his ashes
His ashes are in the car
We promised to bring money to redeem the car, but for now... .
Can I get him back first?
Is he in the car?
- yes - so he 's safe

We 'll be back later. What time do you close?
- five o 'clock - good
bring it on
I don 't have 400 plus VAT

We 'll wait until it closes at five
How did your father die?
heart attack
poor eating habits, not exercising
so miserable
I 'll probably die of a heart attack too.
Why are you getting married?
because i want to get married
All right
Because I thought I wanted to get married
because i have to do something . . .
So just get married
Wake me up when time is up
OK
Theoretically, my situation is pretty miserable.
I 'm a homeless orphan on the run with a married woman
But no matter how miserable life is
there will always be a little beauty
And you have to focus on that beauty
i love you
what? - I said: 'It 's time, let 's go'
- james - miserable
They don 't even have security
- He 's just putting on a security guard 's coat - so what?
follow me
thank goodness
sorry
fine
I can 't cut the lock, you have to drive over it
what? - Exactly
What are you doing, James?
I don 't want to make too much noise
Don 't want to upset him? Good for you
For a moment, it felt like I was back in time
Do you still want to go back?
- Alyssa? - we should stop
what? - Someone 's going to hitch a ride there
She is a lonely woman
What if a weirdo takes her away?
okay
how are you
Hi
