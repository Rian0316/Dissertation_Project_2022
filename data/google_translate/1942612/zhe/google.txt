It 's definitely for someone special It  'sforsomeonespecial . The red wrapping paper is the same color as the lipstick.
Perhaps it was intended to imply that each other oroneshe  ' sdeliberately trying to encourage . Anyway Miss Hope fell in love E itherway , Miss Hooper has love on hermind .
Apparently she cared about him very much T hatshe  ' sseriousabouthim It is clear from the fact she  ' sgivinghimagiftatall that the gift she gave him .
Apparently this shows she 's longing for the relationship for a long time. T hatsuggests long - timehopesasolutely for long
