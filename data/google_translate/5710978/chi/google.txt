- Coach - please say frank
- where do i go - go to the center
OK
- how do i know which is him - it 's this


sorry fork
- Amy - no no I don 't call a fork
- I know it 's... - My name is Frank
do you want to sit down
- Shall we sit down - or just stand
sit down
I . . sit over there
- Then I . . . - no no no
I 'm so talkative
sorry i 'm so nervous
My first time using the . . . system
- me too - really
Yeah, I 'm going to freak out
- You look terrified by the way - don 't you?
Yeah, shivering with fear
or trembling with disgust
At least you don 't . . . pee

Are you sure
Let 's stop talking about peeing
Great idea for a meal or something
yeah ok
- Do you know how we order? - This is supposed to be

The menu has been ordered
- please take it slow sir - thank you
and your lady
Looks like I like pasta
yeah i 'm fish cakes . . .


- it 's delicious - can i try it
is that ok?
who cares
yeah what about him

Really tasty
then we are the first

Let 's take a look at our expiry date
- good idea - okay
Well, it should be seen in 'Information'
hmm 'press to show'
we have to press
Okay, then the last three
Twenty one press
- 1 2 hours - yeah 1 2 hours
- well - kinda . . .
- yeah - kinda short
It 's a bit short, isn 't it?

Also getting shorter and shorter I don 't know it yet . . .
Count down like this
so sad
Maybe we should eat faster
- yeah you 're right - the game starts
eat quickly
Looks like it 's us
does this take us there
should be
- please first - thank you

so big
- here we are - yeah

- Do you want to come drive or I 'll come - come on

Okay
too slow
You are stupid
God it sucks
- are you kidding me - yeah

nice i like this lamp
- Yeah, that 's a nice light. - Stop it.

Um
That is. . .
There are also kits
- shower or tub - both

really not bad

i use the toilet
Well I have to . . . here . . .
Um
Well seriously what should we do?
The question is too broad, please narrow it down
I mean we 're going to . . .
what are you doing
Please define 'open to dry'
I go
Are we going to make love together?
Participants are not required to take any specific action
Yeah but we can do it
If the time is short, someone will do it
if you decide
- It 's up to us - it 's up to you
i can sleep here
Don 't be stupid, you can 't stretch your legs
not so bad
The bed is quite big, I think we can both lie down
Well
It must have been crazy before there was a system
What 's the meaning
People still have to fall in love and figure out who they want to be with

choice powerless
You have too many choices and you don 't know what you want
Yeah yeah, if things don 't go well they have to think about breaking up with them
How do you break up with someone oh my god
- what a nightmare - not like it was planned
It 's not that it 's easier to arrange

- But that 's weird - yeah


then then

thanks for being my first


damn time
feel great you are really great
The same to you
If we still have this time, you can definitely fuck me
- you . . . dead - sorry
- You too - we really screwed up, didn 't we?
Yes
I just don 't think such a short time makes any sense, only 12 hours

Your reactions to brief encounters also provide valuable information to the system
yeah i didn 't do anything
The system thinks I 'm a prude
The system does not make any moral judgments
But how do I know she 's not my perfect partner
she. . .
Your perfect match has not been selected
i know but . . .
The system enhances understanding and uses the collected data through the process of each participant interacting with several subjects
to finally choose the perfect match
On match day I know it 'll always find your perfect match
Yes in 99.8% of cases
But I had to go through a whole lot of love to find it
- That 's right - great
what is that
- new love - so soon
what is this again
Yes
Then I should go change my clothes
I 'll go there, it 's him
I can only identify myself after a personal introduction


Identity confirmation
- i like your hair - yours is nice too
but my own
quite funny

i am frank

Nicola
I 've been here for a while
sorry i went to change clothes
- really - you 've started
- I 'm hungry - of course I 'm sorry

Hurry up and check the expiration date

Yes
one year
Is it a mistake that we can date for a year?
- Did the coach make a mistake? - Didn 't make a mistake
oh my god
there must be a reason
thanks
Think good side curry chicken
what
Chicken curry is a joke
Oh
then you are kidding
- Okay, the last three - Twenty-one

interesting
nine months
ok cheers
cheers
about the same as my last
how many times have you done it
Are you in love? Five so far

I 'm a veteran
I 'm going to take a shower
- ok- it won 't be long


Listen if you don 't mind this is the fifth time I 've been in a relationship I find it 's best to just start having sex
Really
Can break the embarrassment and have an early general understanding of matching
Um
Then I agree to everything
When did you mean to do it
curry this . . .

- what - a little curry

- sorry - you 're heavier when you talk
Feel sorry
no no you have to come from behind
- what- from behind
hurry up
multi-point action
It 's not that much movement and you 're in and out.
It 's like closing a file cabinet drawer
- sorry- so boring
Multi-point side action
is that so
no
What 's up
fine

365 days
I go
can 't i just quit
Yes
it will eventually give you the perfect match
final final
I would say trust the system and it will deliver on its promises
yes to us
You will gain a lot of experience and one day it will find the perfect match for you the best here

If you 're in doubt, stick with it
because it really works
Thanks for the garlic sauce



hello it 's yours . . .
- Yeah Nicola - Nicola



Are you OK
You are not . . . you are real or fake
God is still coming
thanks

- you are beautiful - thank you
I wanted to give you a compliment too, but you just spit food on my shoe
But honestly those shoes are disgusting
That 's just for kicking you
does it hurt
- It hurts - I 'm so sorry goddamn
damn




Lanny This is Frank Frank This is Lenny
Hi Lanny

we spent a little time together
- a very small time - yeah before us
You two are . . . that would be great
You two look a good match
Yes
- uh- see you
Um
- You know that sound you made - what sound
do i have
some often
does it bother you
kinda yes
- I try not to do it. - Okay
5 months
2 months
7 weeks
3 weeks
1 7 seconds I 'm really happy
- It 's a pity it 's over - but there 's no way
anyhow
OK, bye
Here 's a new partner
Yes
good three two one
3 6 hours3 6 hours
OK, bye
- Goodbye
three two one
3 6 hours
end
- I want to say - goodbye
I know now what it 's like to live with the people I hate
Does this help the system
everything has a reason
faster than i thought
Hello


is that correct?
- Yeah - I mean . . .
I didn 't expect the system to let us date again
Me too
I sure hope I 'm right but . . .
Coach, did we sit at the wrong table?
sit right
okay then
Wait, let 's not look at the expiration date

- why- I 'm so annoying about that
The system let me change one by one, it 's all dew love
I know it 's all dew and love is meaningless
I 'm completely absent-minded
I was with someone that week and I know who it is, but I just changed my face
I really feel like I 'm out of my body
My soul flew out and sat on the chair across the room watching myself fuck that man
I was wondering what 's going on?
That 's all a dick in and out of a hole
Yeah, it 's kind of frustrating
But a long-term relationship is just as bad. It 's like a prison waiting for the time to pass. Counting the minutes and the hours
- oh my god it feels it - yeah
- Yeah, let 's not look at the expiration date. - Okay.
- it 's settled- it 's settled
Okay
Serve the fish cake
I do not know either
- how- so
- Why don 't we just do it - I think we have to do it
I don 't know how much time we have
maybe 10 minutes
- do you think you can last 10 minutes - nasty
okay then
Wait, one of us should undress first
- why just one - so much fun
come on, take off your pants
not my idea
All right
This makes me so embarrassed
Then you 'll get back on your feet later
i want to see your dick
Feel sorry
- I want to see it - all right

If there 's no censorship at all, just pair us randomly and we 're all left
Because they 're always promoting how smart the system is
Yeah but it allows people to find their true love
What about a 99.8% success rate?
But how do you know they are a perfect match
If it 's just slowly consuming our patience and allowing us to go through a period of love
In a random order for a random duration and every time you 're a little more submissive and a little bit more heartbroken
until finally it gives the final proposal
And tell you that 's the perfect match by then you 're too frustrated, too tired, you just accept it
And then you have to convince yourself that it 's not going to happen for the rest of your life
Well said is the darkest argument I 've ever heard.
thanks
Okay, do you want to hear my theory?
Suppose the system is not random
- It 's as complicated as they say - good
Well it captures all your reactions with this one, right?
Build a complex profile

Your every crazy thought and all your dreams and weaknesses
- your crazy theory is- everything in your head
If it 's everything in your head
- So does it have a mind? - Well then you mean
'What if that 's us we 're stuck in a simulation?'
how do we know
I don 't know
I 'm probably programmed to scream pain
All right
- come here - no

- Coach - Hello Frank
- I have to know - what do you want to know
I and Amy 's expiry date I need to know how long
Aren 't you going to persuade me not to ask?
Do you want me to persuade you not to ask?
hmm no i . . .

I have no idea
Press to show that both sides must be pressed at the same time
No I don 't do what I said I won 't do
we also shook hands
do not care
5 years
Shigeshin school associate
3 years coach
- Instructor - Recalibration
What 's the matter with the coach, the coach is getting shorter and shorter
One-way viewing makes the validity period unstable
1 8 months
- what- one-way view makes expiration date unstable
Shigeshin school associate
It 's getting shorter and shorter because I watched it myself
- yes- why
Everything for a reason2 months
ok then undo it back
I can 't do recalibration
what if she watched
Once the validity period is shortened, it cannot be extended
3 weeks why
everything has a reason
- don 't do this - recalibrate
- when does it stop - recalibrate
5 days
After the end, it will stabilize and recalibrate
stop stop
20 hours
Are you OK
uh i 'm fine
- ok - i 'm fine

Have you ever had more than 4 hours or less than 4 hours
what are you thinking
fine
Okay what 's really going on
i watched
what did you see
We said good or bad, we shook hands
don 't you want to know how much
I don 't want because I don 't want to
- It was almost over. - How soon?
We only have an hour left
why didn 't you say it sooner
- Don 't want to spoil the atmosphere - wouldn 't that spoil it?
It was five years but now
I watched it turned out something went wrong and it started shortening
- I don 't know what happened - you broke it
no i don 't know
why do you have to watch
I 'm thinking maybe we can figure out a way around it
why do you have to watch
because I like you
I really like you
jeez, isn 't that enough?
that 's not the point
I watched but that 's not the point
Are you sure
What are you doing, you 're more angry with this than you haven 't had much time
yeah because we said yes
listen to me
- listen to me what if we leave it alone - we can 't
listen to me we don 't care about the system
- and then - jump out and jump out of the wall
there is nothing there
how do you know how do you know
- Amy - you ruined
you ruined
It 's fine
- Amy - don 't come with me
Amy sorry
Amy
- everything has a reason - what 's the reason
The system will assess your response to the premature end of a cherished relationship and refine its response to the eventual
Analysis of the Chosen One - You are such a comforter - Thank you

I swear I want to jump over that wall and jump into the wilderness now
That would be against the rules of the system
fuck the system
Failure to follow system rules may result in eviction
I know
God, you can 't make me pissed off, can you?
You must move out of your current residence at the end of the validity period
as if i didn 't know
If I hadn 't seen it, we would have been together for years
she. . .
You know when you meet someone you know right away
you know right away . . .
can you plug me now my jaw hurts
uh come on
He never apologized for all that happened, never once.
that 's too bad
do you mind if i think of her
can i think of him
okay
one two three four
one two three four
Congrats Amy
Your perfect match has been found
Your match day is tomorrow
- A perfect match for 'The Son of Heaven' - yes
- we meet tomorrow - yes
Tomorrow you 'll be paired with your perfect match and you 'll be out of here forever
OK
can you tell me about that man
- Do I already know that person - no
- so - one more thing
What 's up
You can get a short goodbye time before the match day. You can choose your own
Goodbye time is can I say goodbye to someone?
Yes
Data shows this can provide psychological insight
frank i choose frank
Your choice is already registered
wait where do we meet
old place 7:30 pm
Okay
- Coach - Amy please say
count to four
one two three four
wait how long we have
The system has arranged my match day for tomorrow
- me too - ok
I don 't want the person the system chooses for me, okay?
- i want you - i want you too
Not following system rules
- Possibly expelled - get out of the way
do you remember where you were before you came
you can 't remember, can you?
- can 't- me too
- why can 't I remember - this is a test
do you remember our first night together
How do you feel
feel safe and comfortable
feel right
Feels like something is right like we know
It feels like deja vu and it will happen again
It feels like it 's happened thousands of times
- do you understand what i mean - i understand
The world has been playing with us since we knew it
wanna break us up

It 's a test I swear we 're gonna rebel against it to pass the test
we gotta overturn everything
Yeah, we 're going to break all the rules and get out of here
- good to go over the wall - that 's right
- no matter what 's out there - ok

Let 's go
Well let 's go
bring it on
