 [ Colin groans ] Oh .
 Oh , yeah .
 Okay .
 Talk to me .
 Hello .
 Tell me what you 're doing to me .
 Um , we 're gonna ... We 're having sex , we 're having intercourse .
 And , uh ...
 Have I been bad ?
 I don 't know , have you ?
 Oh , for God 's sake , Colin ! Just call me a dirty bitch .
 - I don 't know if I want to . Uh ... - Say it .
 Uh ...
 - Say it ! - Uh ...
 - Uh ... - Say it ! Okay !
 Uh , you 're ... you 're ... you 're a lovely little female dog .
 You 're lovely .

 [ Morris ] Parade , shun !
 Slope arms !
 General salute .
 Present arms !
 Slope arms !
 Not my fault , sir . The rifle 's broken .
 We don 't deal with excuses in this establishment , Groff .
 Keep practicing , and try asking some of your peers to help you .
 I don 't need help , sir .
 We all need help sometimes , son .
 Parade will turn to the left .
 Left turn .
 To your duties .
 Fall out !
 [ Morris ] Everyone inside . Get your breakfast .
 - Come on , man , give it ... - What 's wrong ?
 This isn 't funny , just give me back the hat .
 - What 's wrong with him ? - [ boy ] Hey !
 [ Luke ] Give me the hat .
 - Give me the hat . - Don 't be a pussy , Luke . Oi , Groff !
 [ boys jeering ]
 [ boy 2 ] Nice one , muppet !
 Sorry .
 Bad luck , new kid .
 - War . [ laughs ] - [ Luke ]
 Yeah , all right .

 [ Jakob singing indistinctly in the shower ]
 [ knocking on door ]
 Um , I 'm late for school .
 [ singing continues ] Yeah ...
 How long are you going to be ?
 [ singing continues ]
 - [ Jean ] Morning . - Has Jakob moved in ?
 No . Why ?
 Bathroom is free .
 Darling , I 've been looking through your SRE textbook .
 There is no mention of female pleasure at all .
 I was thinking of talking about it today in assembly , what do you think ?
 [ sighs ] I don 't know .
 [ Jean ] Otis .
 I 'd like your opinion , please .
 - I 've never worked with teenagers before , and you are a teenager .
 - Why ?
 Yep , I 'm a teenager who ... doesn 't want their mother talking about sex at his school .
 There has been a sexual health crisis , and it 's my duty to help .
 You know , he is right .
 It is a bit strange . [ Otis ]
 Mmm , I mean , my mum 's a sexual health expert so it 's not that strange , actually .
 Which doesn 't mean you should have said yes .
 Would you prefer to call me Mum or Dr. Milburn at school ?
 Neither . I 'll be pretending you don 't exist .
 Otis .
 [ sighs ]
 Okay .
 Just try and ... [ blender whirring loudly ]
 Try and be a bit ... [ blender whirring loudly ]
 Try and be less intense .
 It freaks people out .
 And it 's embarrassing .
 I don 't know , Mum , just be normal . Try and be more relatable .
 Whatever , just don 't humiliate me .
 Bye , darling . I 'll see you later .
 - You want a smoothie ?
 - [ door closes ]
 No .
 [ " The Queen of Hearts " by Ezra Furman playing ] [ sighs ]
 [ Otis ] My mum is everywhere .
 It 's like it 's her mission to ruin my life .
 - Were you up all night wanking again ? - No .
 I 've got a handle on that , actually .
 I didn 't sleep much because I 've been doing research .
 - Research ? - Yeah .
 So , Ola and I were kissing the other night and she kept guiding my hand down to her ... area .
 - So I 've been looking up ... - Fingering !
 Don 't yell " fingering , " please .
 - [ laughs ]
 - But , yes , she 's coming over later , and I think I 'm fully prepared .
 Well , Otis , it 's a vagina . It 's not an exam .
 Actually , it 's very complicated .
 - Okay . - I 've been learning about something
 - called the clock technique . - Oh , my God .
 Otis , I think you might be overthinking this .
 She knows I 'm a sex therapist now . I need to get this right .

 [ indistinct chatter ]
 Why is Angel Man staring at me like he 's plotting my death ?
 I don 't know . French people are intense .
 [ laughs ]
 - Morning , dickhead . - Oh , hey .
 - I 've got an 8 : 30 and an 8 : 45 .
 - Okay .
 Why ... why do you look so clean ?
 - What does that mean ? - It 's just an observation .
 Your aptitude scheme , of course . Very professional , Maeve .
 Shut up .
 Can you do a session after school today , by the way ?
 Uh , I can 't . I 'm going to the fair .
 I thought you hated rides .
 Yeah , but Ola loves them , so ...
 Are you going to be there ?
 Funfairs are simply a distraction from the inevitability of death .
 Oh , I guess they are .
 - Hmm .
 - Have fun with the smart kids .
 You look great .
 - Oh , hey ! How you doing ? - Hey .
 I 'm good .
 [ Otis ] This is nice .
 Shall we , uh ...
 Oh , hi , Jackson .
 [ clears throat ]
 Hey , I 'm sorry about your hand .
 - At least you don 't have to swim anymore . - What are you talking about ?
 - You said you didn 't want to swim .
 - Listen , Maeve , you 're not my girlfriend anymore , all right ?
 So you don 't need to pretend that you care .
 Whatever it is you thought I said , you 're wrong .
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 [ sighs ]
 Don 't worry . You 're gonna be fine .
 - May I sit here ? - Uh ...
 Yes .
 Yeah , we 'll find other seats .
 No . No , no . I mean next to you .
 Okay , sure .
 Rahim , you may sit with us . These people are insignificant .
 No , I 'm fine here . Thank you .
 [ Mr. Groff clears throat ] Good morning , Moordale .
 Today we shall be hearing from a sexual health expert who is here to review the school 's sex education curriculum .
 Please give Ms. Milburn ... a very warm welcome .
 Hello .
 My name is Dr. Milburn , and I 'm here to start an open conversation about S- E- X.
 Uh , sex .
 We adults know that some of you are having sex because when we were your age , some of us were having sex .
 - [ pupils chuckling ] - In fact , many of us still have sex .
 I 'm sure even Headmaster Groff sometimes has sex .
 And so , I would like you to tell me what you would like on your sex education curriculum .
 Take control .
 [ microphone feedback ]
 Perhaps you 'd like to know about the female orgasm ...
 [ laughter ]
 ... or mutual masturbation .
 [ laughter ]
 Or maybe you 've always wondered , is my labia a normal length ?
 [ Jean ]
 [ laughing ]
 What I 'm saying is ...
 - [ audience groans ]

 Didn 't you wank off a courgette ?
 [ audience laughing ] [ audience chanting ] Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Courgette !
 Anyway ... [ laughing ] ... there will be an empty box at reception .
 If you have any questions , it is anonymous , so put anything in there that you would like to see
 - in the curriculum . - Courgette wanker !
 [ audience laughing ]

 [ Mr. Groff ] Thank you very much , Moordale .
 I 'm sure we would like to say thank you to Ms. , uh ...
 Forgive me , Dr. Milburn , for her ...
 I don 't understand why everyone is laughing at this nice lady .
 Uh , uh ...
 Because it 's high school .
 [ laughs ]
 [ Mr. Groff ] ... happening this evening , um , available at all prices .
 - Please be careful ...
 - I 'm Rahim . ... nut allergies ...
 Uh , I 'm Eric . ... said issues ...
 Goodbye , Eric .
 Bye . ... nice place to go .
 I highly recommend you , uh , you sign up to that .
 What was that ?
 - Ah .
 Emily , howdy . - Good morning , Mr. Hendricks .
 Now I see where you get your terrible sex therapy skills from .
 Fancy putting in a question ? [ chuckles ]
 [ laughs ]
 No . Nay . Thank you .
 Um ... [ chuckles ]
 I 'm usually the person who answers the awkward questions .
 - I 'm Colin Hendricks .
 - Oh ...
 - You 're the SRE teacher .
 - Yes .
 [ Jean ] Mr. Groff ?
 I 'd really like to observe one of Colin 's SRE classes , please .
 As I keep saying Ms. Milburn , our curriculum is quite satisfactory .
 Well , if it 's as ... satisfactory as you keep saying , then you won 't mind if I sit in on one of the classes .
 Of course not .
 [ clears throat ]
 But I 'm sure that any questions that appear in this box will very easily be answered by Mr. Hendricks , isn 't that right , Colin ?
 Uh ...
 Absolutely .
 Yes . Yes .
 I am , um , I 'm- I 'm a master of sex .
 Very good .
 Good day .
 [ door closes ]
 [ Mr. Groff ] The school is right behind you , Jackson .
 We will do everything in our power to support your speedy recovery .
 Thank you , sir .
 However , your parents and I feel it would be in your best interest to be paired with an academic tutor for the rest of term .
 A peer .
 But my ... my grades are fine .
 Well , you can get by on fine when you 're a star in the pool , but when you 're not ... you have to work as hard as everybody else .
 Good morning , brains of the future .
 I 'm very happy to welcome Maeve Wiley to the program .
 Make her feel at home , please .
 All right .
 Let 's read out our ten- years ' - time essays . [ whispers ]
 We have to read them out loud ?
 [ Emily ] Who wants to go first ?
 I strive for excellence in everything I do .
 The points I gain from my extracurricular activities will earn me a place in Oxbridge where I will ...
 Compete in the IFBB Bodybuilding Championships whilst ...
 Keeping me on track to become the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by the age of 30 , which will ...
 Land me an Erasmus scholarship to NYU Film and Television School and then I 'll make investigative documentaries using my ...
 Purple penis hands .
 is an epic alien love comic book series that will be made into a global movie franchise and eventually be screened in space .
 Right , last but not least .
 Maeve , you 're up .
 [ clears throat ] I left my essay at home , Miss Sands . Sorry .
 Maeve , this class is for people who want to plan for their future and optimize their opportunities .
 Organizational skills are key .
 Don 't let it happen again .
 All right , uh , thanks to Maeve , you can all ... head off to lunch early .
 Oh ... eh , um , uh ...
 On a side note , since Nigel moved back to Australia , the Moordale Quiz Heads are looking for a new member to join the team and compete at the National Student Quiz Championships this year .

 So , who 's interested in joining Viv , Dex and Steve in representing their school ?
 Oh , right , all of you then ?
 Okay , well , I 'll make my decision by tomorrow .
 Off you go .
 Man , I just don 't get why Maeve Wiley is in this class .
 Are you Vivienne Odesanya ?
 Yeah , that 's me , why ? - Jackson Marchetti .
 - I know who you are .
 Okay .
 So , Headmaster Groff said you 'd tutor me this term ?
 [ exhales ] Did he now ? Apparently , you 're the smartest kid in the school .
 That 's true , but I 'm also busy .
 Okay , wait , wait , wait .
 Headmaster Groff said he 'd give you extra credit if you 'd help me out .
 And we don 't actually have to do any work .
 I 've just got to keep Groff happy until I 'm back in the pool .
 - Okay . Your first session 's tonight . - Yeah ?
 Yeah , but it 's the fair tonight .
 Listen , my schedule 's organized for optimum time management .
 Take it or leave it .
 Picnic tables , six o 'clock .
 Bring your maths homework , and don 't be late .
 Should have seen this smug look Ola gave me earlier .
 I don 't like her .
 Why ? She seems nice .
 She 's still hung up on Otis .
 It 's got nothing to do with Otis . I 'm over him .
 - How you getting on with your form ? - [ Aimee ] Everyone has a thing except me .
 I 'm hoping this form is gonna tell me what my thing is .
 - Your thing ? - Yes , my thing .
 You have your feminine books .
 - Feminist . - Steve has his Quiz Brains thing .
 Quiz Heads .
 So great being part of the team .
 What 's so good about it ?
 Well , facts are fun , and if we get through to the final , it 's going to be a very big deal .
 [ Maeve ] What 's your form say ?
 It says I should be a baker .
 Aims , I think it might be banker .
 Baker 's not on there .
 [ mouthing ] Banker ?
 Hmm .
 I think I 'm going to stick with baker .
 I do really like toast .
 Wow .
 Maeve thinks she 's so scary and revolutionary just because she used to have pink hair .
 Is it because she hangs out with your boyfriend all the time ?
 No .
 She 's just not my kind of person .
 Why ? Do you think it 's weird that they run the sex clinic together ?
 Yes .
 - So , how 's it going with Otis ?
 - Good .
 Yeah , well , kind of . Yeah , we 're taking things slow .
 Which is fine .
 I sometimes just wish we 'd move along a bit , you know .
 Not overthink so much .
 Has he touched your vagina ?
 Not yet .
 He sort of hovers and then loses his nerve .
 It 's ... really frustrating .
 - Just tell him what you want . - I think it 'll freak him out .
 Human boys are so fragile .
 [ door opens ]
 - [ man 1 , laughing ]
 Such an idiot . - What are you laughing at ?
 Nothing .
 Then what 's so funny ?
 Luke spilled some water and it looks like he 's pissed himself .
 You need to chill out , man .
 Look ...
 grab it with your right ... and let your left slap it .
 Took me ages to get it as well .
 Is this okay ?
 - Yeah . - Yeah .
 [ exhales nervously ]
 [ Otis ] Okay .
 [ both chuckle ]
 [ Otis ] Yep .
 Oh !
 Oh .
 Ah .
 [ Otis , whispering ] Twelve o 'clock , three o 'clock , six o 'clock , nine o 'clock .
 Did you say something ?
 No , sorry .
 Are you enjoying it ?
 [ Ola gasps ]
 - Then spread it . Back to 12 o 'clock ... - [ moans , chuckles ]
 ... three o 'clock , nine o 'clock .
 [ Ola moaning ]
 [ laughing ]
 - Ooh .
 - Ooh ?
 - Yeah ? - Yeah .
 - Wow . - Yeah .
 It was good ?
 It was ... so nice .
 Okay .
 It was really , really bad .
 He was moving his fingers like he was dialing a 1920s telephone , but really fast , with no rhythm .
 And then he was kind of , like , jabbing at the same time .
 And then he kept looking at the clock on his wall
 like he was timing himself or something .
 You need to tell him it was bad .
 Uh- uh . It 'll hurt his feelings .
 Maybe it will be better next time ?
 I- I definitely have to tell him .
 - [ Eric ] Did you do it ?
 - Uh- huh .
 - [ laughing ] - I know !
 I knew you had a freshly- fingered glow about you !
 - Tell me everything .
 - So ...
 I think I might have facilitated a crescendo .
 - The big O ? - Yeah .
 - First time round ?
 - Yeah .
 I stuck to my clock technique , and I don 't know , bingo .
 - My God . - Orgasm town .
 I feel like maybe fingering is my sexual superpower or something .
 Oh , dude , I 'm so proud of you .
 - Thanks , man . - Let 's go celebrate .
 - What shall we do first ?
 - You don 't think it was beginner 's luck , - do you ?
 - No .
 No , no , no , no , no , you 're definitely Fingertron .
 Oh , my God ! They have Crazy Jungle , come on .
 [ Otis grunts ]
 [ Eric laughing ]
 Why am I here ? I hate fairs .
 You 're here because Steve is doing extra study for your stupid altitude scheme .
 You 're my date .
 - Aptitude scheme , Aimee . - Yeah , that 's what I said .
 - Yeah . - Can you win me a giant pig ?
 Hi .
 Hey .
 [ exhales ]
 [ man ] And we have a winner .
 I need to go find Otis .
 That 's the kind of competitive spirit you should be bringing to aptitude scheme , Maeve .
 See you tomorrow in class .
 I 'll be right back .
 Ms. Sands . Ms. Sands .
 Um ...
 I did write the ... the ten- years ' - time essay .
 I didn 't realize we had to read it out , so I got embarrassed .
 " In ten years ' time , I want to live in a house with big windows , "
 I want the house to be large enough to have a kitchen table with four chairs but not too roomy to ever feel the depth of my aloneness .
 Because I 'll probably be alone .
 But I think aloneness won 't feel so all- consuming with windows
 " that protect me from the world but still let me watch it . "
 I 'm sorry . Sorry .
 I don 't think I belong in the class .
 You 're a beautiful writer , Maeve .
 You can have more expansive dreams than four chairs and some windows .
 Think about it .
 [ sighs ]
 [ indistinct background chatter ]
 - What ? What ?
 - You 're really not good at this .
 Have you got a problem with me or something ?
 Look , uh , it 's simple .
 So this is hidden quadratics .
 You need to substitute the Y ...
 - Mm- hmm . - ... and then back substitute ... the X.
 Oh .
 See , no one 's ever explained it to me like this before .
 You dating Pythagoras , Jackson ?
 Nah , mate , we 're just studying .
 They were just being idiots .
 It 's fine .
 Men who engage in sporting activities at school are statistically more likely to work in menial jobs as adults .
 Well , that 's a bit harsh .
 No , it 's realistic .
 Look , if your hand doesn 't heal , what is your backup plan ?
 And even if it does heal , professional athletes statistically peak at 21 .
 So it might be worth acquiring some other skills .
 Statistics are a real buzzkill , you know that ?
 [ Morris ] Parade , shun !
 Slope arms !
 General salute !
 Present arms !
 Slope arms !
 That ... is a real improvement , Groff .
 To your duties .
 Fall out !
 - Well done , mate . - [ Luke ] Good job , man .
 - We 're going on the Ferris wheel . - Wind isn 't good for my hair .
 I don 't think I was clear .
 Rahim 's going on the Ferris wheel , so we 're going on the Ferris wheel .
 You can squeeze in with me and Anwar for the next ride , Rahim .
 No , thank you .
 What do you mean why are we going on it ? It 's fun .
 It 's the least safe of any of the rides here .
 - It 's fun . - How do you know it 's fun ?
 Because I 'm telling you that it 's fun , that 's how I know .
 [ Otis ] Oh , I am going to die .
 - [ Eric ] Come on then . - I 'm coming , I 'm coming .
 - [ ride rattling ]
 - [ Otis ]
 Ooh !
 - What was that ? That was really unsafe . - Calm down .
 - Eric . Ahh , I 'm sorry . I feel vulnerable .
 - Excuse me , Oatcake !
 Get back here !
 [ Otis ] It 'll be fine , you 're fine .
 - Hello . - Hi .
 Hello .
 [ Ferris wheel music playing ]
 - Why won 't he notice me ?
 - Do you think they do vegan hotdogs ?
 [ Ruby exhales sharply ]
 Milburn , can I have a word , please ?
 Um ...
 It 's about your ... biology test .
 What ... What biology test , sir ?
 It 's not really about a test . There is no test .
 Listen ...
 I heard on the grapevine that you deal with matters of the heart .
 And I 'm desperate for some advice .
 Thing is , I have a friend who speaks Spanish and I can 't understand her at all .
 She says things like , [ speaking broken Spanish ] ... and ... all I can hear is ...
 Shakira , Shakira .
 I don 't speak Spanish , sir .
 I can 't do dirty talk .
 I find it mortifying .
 Oh ...
 Well , uh ... sometimes when we learn new skills , we can feel exposed .
 And you wouldn 't go to a foreign country without some basic understanding of the language .
 Right ?
 So why don 't you write a script for yourself and practice speaking the words until they feel more comfortable ?
 It 's about making an effort to take little steps to meet her halfway .
 Does that makes sense ?
 Yes .
 [ chuckles ]
 - What shall we say , a pony ?
 - Ah ...
 Uh ...
 - Or a monkey ? - Please don 't pay me .
 Let 's not speak of this again .
 You bet .
 [ ride hinges squeaking ]
 - So , what are the interesting landmarks ... - Um ... ... around here ?
 There 's nothing interesting to see round here .
 [ laughs ]
 Very boring .
 Sorry .
 Only boring people get bored .
 " As if you were on fire from within .
 The moon lives in the lining of your skin . "
 Uh , pardon ?
 - It 's about finding beauty in the world .
 - Oh .
 - It 's a poem by Pablo Neruda .
 - Oh .
 I don 't know her .
 [ ride motor whirring ]
 - Goodbye . - Uh , bye .
 [ Ola ] I think you 're jabbing the duck too hard , Otis .
 Maybe you should just try it a bit softer ... a bit slower maybe .
 Yes ! See , I got ... See .
 Thank you . Thank you , sir .
 Ta- da !
 For you .
 - There you go . - [ mouthing ] Tell him .
 Okay . Um , thank you .
 I need to tell you something .
 - Um ... - Sure .
 Okay . Uh , I ...
 Uh , I really , really don 't like ...
 goldfish .
 Here you go .
 - [ chuckles ] - Yeah .
 Okay , thanks .
 Yeah .
 Hey , do you wanna hang at mine ?
 - We could , you know ... - No .
 I 've got loads of homework that I need to do .
 - In fact , I need to go ... now . - Okay .
 - But thank you so much for the bear . Dog . - Thank you for the fish .
 Okay , I 'll see you .
 [ clears throat ]
 [ gasps ]
 My friend 's boyfriend doesn 't know how to finger her properly .
 I 'm off duty , sorry .
 He 's really bad at it .
 Tell your friend 's boyfriend to look up something called the clock technique .
 It looks a bit complicated at first , granted , but once you get it right , the results are astounding .
 It 's you . You 're my friend 's boyfriend .
 You 're bad at fingering .
 Please don 't tell Ola I said anything , but ... sort it out ?
 [ doorbell buzzing ]
 I 'm ready to talk dirty .
 [ Colin gasps ]
 I 'm gonna do nasty things to you .
 - [ Emily groans ] - Yeah . I 'm gonna get you so wet .
 You 're going to feel like your water just broke .
 - What ?
 - I 'm gonna treat you so badly , you 'll be late for work tomorrow and I 'm gonna get you fired , completely ruin your life .
 [ chuckles ]
 Wait that 's not ... Is that right ?
 Um ...
 [ gasps ]
 [ sighs ]
 Uh ... this isn 't working .
 Isn 't it ?
 [ sighs ]
 [ whispering ]
 Grab your stuff .
 Come with us .
 [ door opens ]
 [ sniffs ]
 [ Luke ] Here you go . That 'll keep you warm .
 [ Eli ] Are you homesick yet ?
 I was proper homesick when I first got here .
 Yeah .
 - He used to cry every night for his mummy . - Did not .
 [ laughs ]
 I miss my mum a bit , but ... not my dad though .
 He 's ...
 An arsehole ?
 Yep , my dad 's a dick too .
 My dad 's a pussy .
 A mean one .
 [ loudly ] Fuck all the mean dads .
 Fuck 'em !
 [ laughs ]
 Fuck all the dads .
 - You got a girlfriend ? - Yep .
 Her name 's Aimee .
 Big tits .
 You a boob or an arse man ?
 I like elbows .
 [ laughing ]
 - I love you . - [ Sofia ] Oh , hold on , darling .
 I 'm not training , Mum .
 Got to keep on track . You 'll be swimming again before you know it .
 Well , what if I 'm not ?
 You know , maybe I should get , like , a new hobby or something .
 But your hand is going to heal .
 - Yeah . - Yes ?
 - Yeah . - Okay .
 Go on .
 - Have a good day . - Yeah , you too .
 [ indistinct chatter ]
 - Well , what do I do ?
 - [ stammers ]
 You 're kind of asking the wrong guy about fingering , dude .
 I don 't know . Shit .
 For you to read .
 Thanks .
 Thank you .
 First , he looks at me like he wants to kill me , then he calls me boring , and now he 's giving me books .
 - Maybe he wants to be your friend . - Or maybe he 's a teenage Ted Bundy .
 This is serious , okay ?
 I need to find someone who understands vaginas .
 Your mum .
 - I 'm being serious . - No , Otis , your mum is here .
 Okay .
 All right .
 Good luck , Fingertron .
 [ laughing ]

 [ mutters to himself ]
 I 'm branching out . You should audition .
 [ chuckles ]
 That 's not really my thing .
 Thanks , though .
 But you 're acting all the time .
 And you 'll probably get a sword .
 No hats .
 Take it to your dorm .
 Come on .
 [ Eli and Luke moaning ]
 I 've still got your , uh , hat .
 [ moaning continues ]
 - We 're not poofs or anything .
 - Yeah , I was thinking about my girlfriend .
 And I was thinking of your girlfriend , you know ... with the big tits .
 I won 't tell anyone .
 I need your advice .
 I 'm pretty ...
 I 'm bad at fingering . Really bad .
 And my girlfriend is actively avoiding me .
 Please help .
 Okay .
 But only because I pity you .
 - Show me what you did then .
 - I was about to eat that .
 - You want me to ...
 - Mm- hmm .
 Okay . Um ...
 Sorry .
 Well , I ...
 I started at ...
 I started at 12 o 'clock ... and went to three o 'clock , and then back down to six .
 Oh , it 's juicy . And then there was nine .
 Congratulations , you can tell the time .
 [ stammers ]
 Then I carried on , clockwise , then I flipped it anti- clockwise .
 So you DJ- ed on her vag .
 What 's with the clock thing ?
 - It 's a technique . - It 's weird .
 Continue .
 Well , I sort of continued that motion ...
 Oh , then I had a spread , which was kind of like that .
 That 's ...
 - And continued to apply pressure , and ... - Stop jabbing .
 - It 's not , I 'm not really jabbing .
 - I think I 'd know , it 's my orange .
 - Actually , it 's my orange . - Shh .
 Okay , um ...
 - This is ridiculous . I 'm sorry .
 - Look ... there 's no magic technique that works with all women .
 Every orange is different , but you shouldn 't be asking me , you should be asking your girlfriend .
 Tune into her orange .
 Yeah .
 Okay , we 're done now .
 Thank you .
 [ Colin ] Okay , everyone .
 It 's SRE question time .
 Okay ?
 In the old box , and ...
 Ah !
 [ laughs ]
 It doesn 't matter .
 [ clears throat ]
 Okay .
 " Can I get pregnant from only giving hand jobs ? "
 [ class laughing ]
 [ Colin ] Okay , um ...
 Well , fertilization only occurs when Mr. Sperm enters Mrs. Egg .
 So , no is the answer .
 Okay ...
 Good .
 [ Colin ]
 Um ...
 " My boyfriend doesn 't want to wear a condom .
 What should I do ? "
 Uh ...
 Hell .
 Condoms protect the egg from fertilization .
 - Okay .
 what about gay sex ?
 Well , you can 't get pregnant from , um , homosexual activity .
 [ Rahim ] But what about pleasure ?
 People don 't always have sex to make a baby .
 [ Colin ]
 Mm .
 Um ...
 Where was I ? The , uh ... The egg ...
 What type of lubricant would you recommend for doing anal sex ?
 [ Jean ] Well , you should always use a water- based lubricant .
 Oil- based products will decompose the latex in the condom .
 And , sorry , just to answer the previous question , no matter how persistent a sexual partner is about not using contraception , remember it is always your right to say no .

 Always .
 Cool .
 Uh , Ms. Milburn ?
 Has that given you enough information for your report then ?
 Well , quite frankly , Mr. Groff , I 'm shocked by the ineptitude .
 I 'll be spending the next few weeks getting to know the students and their needs a bit better .
 I 'm not sure the board will agree to anything that drastic .
 I 've already spoken to Maxine Tarrington , and she approves .
 I 'm looking forward to working with you , Mr. Groff .
 Oh , for God 's sake !
 Did you know you need , like , sugar and flour and an oven to bake ?
 And you don 't just shove it all in , you have to follow all these rules .
 Yeah , it 's called a recipe .
 Hey , Maeve , you 're our new Quiz Head . High five .
 Don 't let me down .
 Hey , have you guys ... Have you seen Ola anywhere ?
 - Maeve got on the quiz team . - Oh , good job .
 If you see Ola , I 'm looking for her .
 Are you happy , babes ?
 I don 't think I 'm over Otis .
 That is what I keep saying .
 Oh , my God ! Your mum is everyting .
 She talked about anal sex in front of Mr. Groff .
 - Jean actually gives me life . - That 's not good news , Eric .
 Oh , and I think Rahim is gay .
 - That actually makes a ton of sense .
 - Mm- hmm .
 Staring at you , wanting to sit next to you all the time , giving you books .
 He probably likes you .
 Otis , I don 't think so .
 Read the signs , Eric . I have to go .
 [ exclaims ]
 Sir ! I was wrong . I was wrong .
 You have to tune into orange .
 Just listen to what she 's actually saying .
 That 's how you learn Spanish , huh ?
 Good luck !
 It 's an apple .

 Hi .
 I know I 'm bad at fingering .
 I was really busy trying to get it right , and I wasn 't listening to you .
 We don 't ever have to do it again .
 Or ...
 I could show you what I like ?
 [ knock at door ]
 Could you explain why you enjoy dirty talk so that I can understand ?
 If not , I bought dips .
 Loads of them .
 I feel like a dowdy teacher all day , so ... when I 'm at home , I want to escape and to feel ...
 Like a female dog ?
 No . [ laughs ]
 Colin , I don 't care what you say .
 I just ... want to feel sexy .
 [ scoffs ]
 So it 's not about the words .

 Spatula .
 Pepper grinder .
 Milk frother .
 Ice cream scoop .
 [ moaning ]
 Baba ghanoush !
 Oh !
 Baba ghanoush !
 Say it again ! Baba ... [ moaning ]
 Ghanoush !
 [ both moaning ]
 [ both laugh ]
 [ both exhale ]

 That 's not mine .
 They planted it .
 And why would they do that ?
 Does this ... belong ... to you ?
 [ sergeant ]

 Left , right , left , right , left , right , left !
 Left , right , left , right , left , right , left !
 I lied .
 I lied . It 's not my weed .
 They wanted to get me expelled because they 're ... poofs .
 Sir .
 Yes .
 Quite a lot of us are poofs in this institution .
 But some things are better left unacknowledged .
 So I don 't have to ... go home ?
 You were found with drugs in your possession , Adam .
 I 'm sorry .
 [ " Bashed Out " by This Is The Kit playing ]

 [ Mr. Groff ] That was your last chance at a formal education .
 If you put one foot out of line , you won 't have a roof over your head .
 Understood ?
