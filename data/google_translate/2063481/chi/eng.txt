 00 : 00 : 06, 747 -- > 00 : 00 : 08, 348 It 's from What do you think ?
 I don 't know .
 If we 're going to start a fantasy sword collection -- and I 've long thought we should -- is this really the sword to start with ?
 What did you have in mind ?
 Well , off the top of my head , I 'd have to go with Excalibur .
 It gives you the right to rule England . It would be a replica of a movie prop .
 Fair enough .
 It 'd give you the right to rule a replica of England .
 Well , they don 't have an Excalibur here , so what do you want to do ?
 Mm .
 Tough decision .
 There 's no weaponry from forged in a Chinese sweatshop ?
 Just Bilbo Baggins ' sword over there .
 Two grown men with a hobbit 's dagger ; wouldn 't we look silly ?

 Okay , let 's go for it .
 Oh , I see you guys have found my little treasure .
 Yeah .
 It 's okay , I guess . Okay ?
 It 's magnificent .
 Buh- buh- buh- buh !
 What do you want for it ?
 Oh , it 's hard to put a price on something that 's a copy of something that was on pay cable .
 But for my friends , let 's say 250 ?
 Oh , that 's pretty steep .
 Well , it 's a limited edition .
 They only made 8, 000 of these bad boys .
 Only 8, 000 ?
 We 're wasting precious time .
 Buy it . Hang on .

 Can you do any better ?
 Are you kidding ?
 I 'm already giving you the friends and family discount .
 Oh , did you hear that ?
 We 're getting the friends and family discount .
 We are honored and we will take it .
 Slow down .
 Two hundred . What are you doing ?
 250 is already the discounted price .
 Will you shut up ?
 Tell you what , I 'll go 235 .
 Nope . Maybe another time .
 Okay , 225 -- my final offer .
 Take it , take it .
 Two hundred .
 Man , you 're killing me !
 Killing you ?
 I can 't breathe .
 210 , and I 'm losing money .
 Oh , now , we can 't let him lose money , Leonard . I 'm so sorry .
 210 and you throw in the Iron Man helmet .
 Are you crazy ?
 That helmet 's signed by Robert Downey Jr .
 So ?
 Okay , if you 're going to question the importance of an actor 's signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book , then all of our lives have no meaning !



 Okay , fine .
 Just the sword , 210 .
 Thank you .
 I can eat meat this week .
 See that ?
 I just saved us 40 bucks .
 I 've long said , what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts .
 You want me to wrap it ?
 No , it 's okay .
 I 'm gonna stab my friend in the chest .
 Hey , Stuart .
 Ah , hey , Wil .
 Hello , Wil Wheaton .
 Hi , Sheldon .
 Nice sword .
 It 's part of my sword collection .
 - Do you have a sword collection ?
 - No . I 'm not surprised .

 Here 's the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted .
 Awesome . What do I owe you ?

 40 bucks .
 Good deal .
 Sucker .
 Didn 't even ask for the friends and family discount .
 Hey , I 'm having a party at my house on Friday , and I was hoping you would stop by .
 Will there be girls there ? Yeah , of course .
 ' Cause there wasn 't last time .
 There will be girls .
 You guys are invited if you want to come by .
 Thank you .
 All right , great .
 Later .

 I see what you 're doing .
 You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy , he tells everyone we 're going to be there , and when we don 't show , he looks the fool .
 Fiendishly clever .
 I was actually thinking about going .
 And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out , leaving him humiliated in front of his guests .
 Love it .
 No , I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time .
 Oh , great , more guys .
 It 's gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage- fest .

 Sheldon , can you grab me a water ? Possibly .
 Can you or can 't you ?
 It 's not that simple , Leonard .
 It never is , is it ?
 At this moment , our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states .
 Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton 's party , you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend .
 I 'm characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger 's Friendship .
 Got it .
 Can I have my water ?
 Of course .
 Now get it yourself , you traitor .
 Wait , what is going on ?
 In case you have forgotten ,
 Schrodinger 's cat is a thought experiment ...
 No , no , I didn 't forget .
 Um , there 's this cat in a box and until you open it , it 's either dead or alive or both .
 Although , back in Nebraska , our cat got stuck in my brother 's camp trunk , and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there .


 Homespun stories , knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it .
 You 're the whole package , aren 't you ?

 Sorry I 'm late . Uh , I got great news .
 NASA picked my team 's design for the deep field space telescope that 's going on the International Space Station this spring .
 Howie , that 's wonderful !
 Congratulations !
 It gets better .
 Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist , and guess who that someone is .
 Muhammad Li .
 Who 's Muhammad Li ?
 Muhammad is the most common first name in the world , Li , the most common surname .
 As I didn 't know the answer ,
 I thought that gave me a mathematical edge .
 It 's me , Sheldon .
 It 's me . I 'm going up in space !

 Technically , I 'm an astronaut .
 That 's amazing !
 Hang on a second .
 NASA doesn 't have a shuttle anymore .
 How are you going to get up there ?
 Oh , well , it 's really cool .
 You fly to Moscow , they take you out to Kazakhstan , and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit .
 Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market .

 Are those Russian rockets safe ?
 Well , I mean , safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl .

 I 'd like to propose a toast .
 The dream to go up into space is one we all share , and Howard 's making that a reality .
 We 're all very proud of you .
 Cheers .
 That was a lovely toast .
 Kudos . Thank you .
 Simultaneously , a festival of cloying clichés .
 You sicken me .

 You 're really quiet .
 Is everything okay ?
 Fine .

 Just a little tired .
 I hope not too tired , because I 'm feeling particularly masculine right now .
 All systems go , if you catch my drift .
 I always catch your drift . All right , well , something 's obviously bugging you .
 What is it ?
 I just can 't believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me .
 Oh , I get it .
 You 're worried about me .
 That is so sweet .
 You know , there 's a saying we have at NASA .
 What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home .
 Just stop talking , Howard .
 This isn 't the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut .
 What did you think was going to happen ?
 Honestly ?
 Sex .
 Howard .
 Do you realize what a big deal this is ?
 What an honor it is to be chosen to go into space ? Yeah , I get it .
 I just wish you included me in the decision .
 We 're supposed to be partners .
 We 're supposed to be a team .
 I 'm sorry .
 You 're right .
 Okay , let 's try this again .
 Bernadette , an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us , and I 'd like to discuss it .
 Okay .
 I 've been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks .
 What are your thoughts on that ?
 Well , first of all , thank you for including me in the decision- making process .
 Hey , we 're a team .
 So , what do you think ?
 No .
 No ?
 No .
 Why not ?

 Howard , my father was a police officer .
 We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive .
 It was horrible .
 And I don 't want to live that way with you .
 Hey , my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11 .
 We never saw him again . Oh , boo- hoo , you 're not going to space !

 Pretty cool about Howard , huh ? Don 't talk to me as if nothing 's happened between us .
 And yes , it sure is , buddy .

 For God 's sake , will you stop with the Schroer stuff .
 Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle , in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you , but not both ?



 You never stop talking , do you ?
 I don 't understand .
 What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton 's party ?
 Wil Wheaton is Sheldon 's mortal enemy .
 Mortal enemy ? Sheldon , I know you 're a bit of a left- handed monkey wrench , but ... you really have a mortal enemy ? Mm- hmm .



 In fact , I have 61 of them .
 Would you like to see the list ?
 Oh , say no , say no , say no , say no .
 You just got off the list .
 Would you like back on it ?
 This 'll just take a moment .
 It 's on a five and a quarter inch floppy .

 A floppy disk ?
 Well , I started the list when I was nine .
 How did Wil Wheaton get on the list ? - Oh ! Oh , God !
 - Oh !
 Come on !
 As a child , I loved Wesley Crusher ,
 Wil Wheaton 's character on
 So , I drove for hours by bus to a convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear , so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed .
 But he never showed , because apparently , it was cooler for him to be the lower- left corner on



 Oh , damn !
 The floppy failed .
 Well , whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989 , congratulations , you just made the list .

 Howard ?
 Change your mind about sex ?
 I 'm still mad , but I 'll do it .
 No , I 've just been thinking . It doesn 't matter if I 'm afraid for your safety .
 I don 't want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams .
 Really ?
 Really .
 If going into space means that much to you ,
 I will never say another word about it .
 Thank you .
 I love you .
 I love you , too .

 So , sex now ? Okay .
 I just forgot to brush my teeth .
 I 'll be right back .

 ♪ Oh , baby ♪
 ♪ I 'm ♪ ♪ I 'm not in love with you ... ♪
 Over my dead body my son goes into outer space !
 I 'm ready .
 Wait , let me see if I got this right .
 You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night ?
 What choice did I have ?
 She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me .
 Wow . You 're not only our first astronaut .
 You 're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed .
 You 're like a rock star .
 Little bit .
 I hate to say it , but she did kind of betray you .
 Interesting .
 You see betrayal in others , but not yourself .
 Going to Wheaton 's party is not betraying you .
 Oh , of course you would have to believe that .
 Evil always thinks it 's doing right .
 " Excuse me , Stormtrooper .
 These are the droids you 're looking for . "
 I 'm going to a party .
 I 'm not turning R2- D2 and C- 3PO over to the empire !
 Not yet .
 So , what 's gonna happen next ?
 Are you and Bernadette going to break up ?
 I don 't know .
 If we 're going to get back together , she 's going to have to apologize and accept that I 'm a grown man who can make his own decisions .
 Then she 's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space .
 Obviously .
 I had no choice .
 I had to tell his mother .
 He can 't go to space .
 He 's like a baby bird .
 Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book ?
 You 're kidding .
 No , I was there that day .
 Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book .
 I don 't know what I 'm going to do .
 I don 't want to break up over this .
 Okay , why don 't you just tell him you made a mistake ?
 Do you guys think it was a mistake ?
 Am I the bad guy in this ?
 It 's not for us to judge .
 We 're just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you 've done .
 Oh , God , you 're right .
 I took our love and threw it under his bus- sized mother .
 I need to apologize .
 Well , that- that 's good . I 'm glad you came to that .
 But before you do , let me just ask you a big picture question .
 What ?
 Are you 100 % positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz ?
 I do , with all my heart .
 Got it . Just had to check .


 He 's great .

 All right , Sheldon .
 We 're going to Wil 's .
 This is your last chance .
 No , Leonard , this is last chance .
 One day , a historian is going to come to you and say ,
 " Is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper ? "
 And you 're going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble , " I was , but
 " I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from that no one remembers . "


 You want to drive ?
 Sure .

 Hey , Sheldon ?
 Oh , good .
 You picked me , you picked me .
 No , I just got a text from Stuart .
 Brent Spiner is at the party .
 Brent Spiner ? Yes .

 I don 't care .
 Really ?
 Brent Spiner ,
 Mr. Data himself .
 You love him .
 I did , but I think I 've kind of outgrown
 You know , stock characters ,
 ludicrous plots , " beam me up . "
 What a load of hooey .
 I 'm going .
 Live long and prosper , Sheldon . Yeah , even that .
 You look like a dork .



 Howard , Bernadette 's here ! Tell her I 'm not home !
 What kind of a schmuck play is that ? !
 She can hear you shouting !
 Can we talk ?
 You can .
 I have nothing to say .
 All right .
 I just wanted to tell you
 I 'm sorry I said something to your mother .
 I was gonna tell her eventually , but you went behind my back .
 I know . I 'm sorry . I got scared .
 If you 're gonna love me , you 're gonna have to love the whole package : the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil .


 I know .
 Well , don 't say it if you 're not gonna mean it ,
 ' cause I 'm not just gonna stop with the space station .
 Yeah , I want to go to the Moon , I want to go to Mars .
 I want to take a one- man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean .
 Really ?
 You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean .
 Well , those big kids were rocking it .
 I just did what I did because I love you so much , and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle .
 Really ? You 're my soul mate .

 This is where you kiss me .
 Right , right .
 Make up all you want !
 Your tuchis is not leaving this planet !

 Hey , you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in
 - Yeah .
 - Well , I just met her gynecologist !

 What are you doing here ?
 Fighting for our friendship .
 As peculiar and annoying as you can be , you 're still my little buddy .
 I 'm not going to let that end here tonight .
 Now put down that drink , let 's meet Brent Spiner and go home .
 Hey , Sheldon , I 'm so glad you made it . I found something I think you might like .
 What I 'd like is for him to have a more depressing home .
 This is quite lovely .
 This is for you .
 An original mint- in- package Wesley Crusher action figure .
 I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed , and I didn 't show up .
 Look at what I wrote .
 " To Sheldon , sorry this took so long .
 Your friend , Wil Wheaton "
 It 's my last one .
 I want you to have it .
 Look , everyone .
 Wil Wheaton is my friend !

 Oh , wow .
 I haven 't seen one of these in years . Remember how we used to make these things look
 like they were masturbating ?
 Brent Spiner , what have you done ? !
 That was an original mint- in- package
 Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend , Wil Wheaton .
 Sorry , Slim .
 I 've got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car .
 You want me to sign one for you ?
 You 've already signed something , Brent Spiner .
 Your name on my list .

 From this moment on , you are my mortal enemy . Don 't worry . It doesn 't take up a whole lot of your time .
 Come on , buddy .
 Let 's not waste another second on this loser .
 Love your house .
 Can get autographed dolls ?
 Sure .
 20 bucks .
 Ten .
 $18 . $12 . $16 .
 Two for $30 .
 And you come to my birthday party .
 Done .
