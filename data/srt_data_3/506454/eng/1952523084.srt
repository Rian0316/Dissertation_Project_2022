1
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,251
Oh,
sorry Holmes.

2
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,287
No, no,

3
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,857
you couldn't have come at a better time.

4
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,259
I was afraid you were engaged.

5
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,660
I am,
very much so.

6
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,331
Dr. Watson shares my love
of all that is bizarre,

7
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,768
but outside the routine
of everyday existence.

8
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,603
It is at present and impossible to say...

9
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,339
...that this case is an
instance of crime or no.

10
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,174
But suffice it to say that I know as little...

11
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,343
...about Mr. Jay Beards Wilson
as you do yourself,

12
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,045
beyond the obvious facts.

13
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,481
That he has done manual
labor at sometime.

14
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,750
But it takes staff that he has been to China.

15
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,185
And that he has done...

16
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,720
...a considerable amount of writing lately.

17
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,488
How in the name of good fortune...

18
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,291
...did you know all that Mr. Holmes?

19
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,693
As true as gospel I once did manual labor.

20
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,129
I started off as a ship's carpenter.

21
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,731
Your hands my good servant.

22
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,299
The muscles of your right hand...

23
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,034
...are more developed than the left.

24
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,669
And the writing?

25
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,304
What else could be indicated.

26
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,773
By the right cuffs are
very shiny for five inches.

27
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,676
And the left sleeve with
smooth pattern over the elbow...

28
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:47,214
...where you lean it on
the desk... but China?

29
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,984
The fish tattooed immediately
above his right wrist.

30
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,420
I have made a small study of tattoo marks.

31
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,589
Mr. Wilson, and have even contributed...

32
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,558
...to the literature of the subject.

33
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,927
That trick of staining the fish scales,

34
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,062
a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.

35
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,231
Wherein addition I see
a Chinese coin hanging...

36
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,632
...from his watch chain.

37
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,468
The matter becomes even more simple.

38
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,969
Well I never...

39
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,838
I thought at first it was something clever,

40
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:14,848
but now I see there's nothing in it after all.

41
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:19,613
You know I begin to think
that my reputation...

42
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,016
...such as it is will suffer
shipwreck if I'm so candid...

43
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,086
...pro magnifico.

44
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,157
Everything becomes
commonplace by explanation.

45
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,026
Watson that is a very loose translation.

46
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,363
Oh, please show the doctor
that advertisement.

47
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:41,802
Oh, there, you can read it for yourself sir.

48
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,705
To the Red Headed League.

49
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,207
On account of the request...

50
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,043
...of the late Iscar Hopkins of Lebanon.

51
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,247
Pennsylvania USA there
is a vacancy open...

52
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:56,283
...which entitles a member
of the league to a salary...

53
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:00,387
...of four pounds a week
for purely nominal services.

54
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:04,791
All red headed men sound
in body and mind...

55
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:08,292
...and above the age of 21 are eligible.

56
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:12,166
Apply in person on Monday
at 11:00 to Mr. Duncan Ross...

57
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,835
...at the offices of the League,

58
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,237
7 Copes Court Fleet Street.

59
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,337
Is this serious?

60
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,843
It is a little off the beaten track, hey Watson.

61
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,880
Oh, would you make a note
of the paper and the date?

62
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,150
Evening standard of Saturday
the 27th of April,

63
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,685
two months ago.

64
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,153
Do try this sitting.

65
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,718
Now, Mr. Wilson,
off you go...

66
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,393
...at scratch and tell us all about yourself.

67
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:42,663
Oh, well gentlemen I have a small...

68
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:46,166
...pawn broking business
in Sax Coburg Street,

69
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,266
near the city.

70
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,337
It's not a very large affair.

71
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,506
It just gives me a living.

72
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,976
I used to keep two assistants
but now I just keep the one.

73
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,780
And to tell you the truth
I'd have a job to make you pay...

74
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,783
...but the deeds willing
to come at half wages...

75
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,319
...so as to learn the business.

76
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,421
About two months ago...

77
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,757
What is the name of the obliging youth?

78
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,359
Vincent,
Vincent Spalding.

79
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,062
Oh, but he's not such a youth
either Mr. Holmes.

80
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,897
It's difficult to say his age...

81
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,833
...but I couldn't wish for a smarter assistant.

82
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,902
You seem most remarkably fortunate.

83
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,338
In having an employee who
comes under the market price.

84
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,973
I don't know that your assistant...

85
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,108
...is not as remarkable
as your advertisement.

86
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,811
Oh, but he does have his faults.

87
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,380
However, he was such a
fellow for photography.

88
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,215
Always snapping away with his camera...

89
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,285
...when he should be improving
his mind and then diving down...

90
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,754
...into the cellar to develop
the wretched things.

91
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,956
Still on the whole he's a good worker.

92
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,625
No vice in him.

93
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,720
It was he who first showed
me the advertisement.

94
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,142
I wish to the lord I was
a red headed man Mr. Wilson.

95
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,844
Why is that?

96
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,679
Well there's another vacancy...

97
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,215
...in the League of Red Headed Men.

98
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,350
I've never heard of it.

99
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:15,289
Well, I'd wonder at that
you being so eligible yourself.

100
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,991
Nice money too.

101
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:22,029
A couple hundred a year
and the work's light...

102
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,703
Oh, there'll be thousands
of red headed men apply.

103
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,705
Oh, well I doubt that sir.

104
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,241
Well nobody with such a fine fiery color...

105
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,310
...as you're blessed with Mr. Wilson.

106
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,580
But then I suppose
it's only worth your while...

107
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,582
...to put yourself out of the way...

108
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,083
...for sake of a few hundred pounds.

109
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,183
Yes, sir.

110
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,593
Well I'm very much of a
stay at home sort of person.

111
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:56,864
Sometimes weeks on end before
I put my foot over the doormat...

112
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,533
...but this it looked interesting.

113
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,436
I was intrigued and young Vincent...

114
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,605
...said he'd come with me.

115
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,841
So, on Monday morning
we shut up the shop...

116
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,941
...and off we went.

117
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,047
Now, Vincent let's go back.

118
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,783
I can't get by the crowd.

119
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,351
Courage Mr. Wilson.

120
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,853
We're so near and so much at stake.

121
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,388
Now you put your coat on...

122
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,698
...and come along with me.

123
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,141
Ohy, Ohy, Ohy,
a little less noise...

124
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,241
...please gentlemen.

125
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,048
Here, here what's your game?

126
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,017
Hey get out of here.

127
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,117
Hey, hey...

128
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,578
Off you go,
you next, get in.

129
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:07,968
Hey, where are you going?

130
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,436
Straight this way,
Come on.

131
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,171
This is Mr. Wilson.

132
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,566
Right in you go Mr. Wilson.

133
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,856
Admirably suited.

134
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:32,459
Every requirement.

135
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,931
Very quiet.

136
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,134
Congratulations Mr. Wilson.

137
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,158
It would be injustice to hesitate.

138
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:49,252
You will I'm sure excuse me
if I take an obvious precaution.

139
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,613
Tears in your eyes.

140
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,382
I perceive all is as it should be.

141
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,684
We have to be careful.

142
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,988
Twice deceived by wigs,
once by paint.

143
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,891
I could tell you tales of cobblers wags...

144
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:07,094
...that would disgust
you with human nature.

145
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:10,831
My name is Duncan Ross.

146
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,967
I am myself a pension upon a fund left by...

147
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,136
...a noble benefactor.

148
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,008
I see you're about to question
me about Mr. Ethic Guya Hopkins.

149
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:25,612
He was himself red headed.

150
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,749
In his youth he left London
for America where he made...

151
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,018
...many millions of dollars.

152
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,821
On his death it was found
that he had instructed...

153
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:38,625
...a trustee in his will
to make life a little easier...

154
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:42,296
...for the red headed men
in the town of his birth.

155
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:45,365
Wonderful color.

156
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,469
Now what's your full name Mr. Wilson?

157
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,704
Jay Beards Wilson.

158
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:54,459
Jay Beards Wilson
and are you a married man.

159
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:55,876
Mr. Wilson?

160
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,511
Do you have a family?

161
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,746
No,
I'm a widower.

162
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,142
No, I never had any family.

163
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:06,053
Oh dear,
sad to hear you say that.

164
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,622
The fund of course is for the propagation...

165
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,824
...and spread of red headed men...

166
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:14,069
...as well as with their maintenance.

167
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,398
In another case the objection might be fatal.

168
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:21,935
However, I've think we've
got to stretch a point...

169
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:26,625
...in favor of a man with
such a head of hair as yours.

170
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,327
The vacancy has been filled.

171
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,724
The vacancy is filled.

172
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,627
Now,
off you go.

173
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,395
Sorry about that.

174
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,998
Off you go.

175
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:12,853
Now, when would you be free
to start upon your new duties?

176
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:16,390
Oh, well it is rather awkward
as I do have a business already.

177
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,991
What would be the hours?

178
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,626
10:00 to 2:00.

179
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,795
Well the mornings are quiet.

180
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,464
I do have an assistant.

181
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:25,666
Yes, that would suit me very well.

182
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,001
And the money mentioned,
four pounds a week.

183
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,002
Correct.

184
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,337
And the work?

185
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,505
Purely nominal.

186
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,475
Yes, but what do you call purely nominal?

187
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,643
Well, you have to stay in the office...

188
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,746
...or at least in the building the whole time.

189
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:41,148
If you leave you forfeit
your whole position forever.

190
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,050
The will is quite clear on that point.

191
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,585
Oh, I shouldn't dream of leaving.

192
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,286
No, excuse will avail.

193
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,622
Not a sickness,
business, anything else.

194
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,959
Here you will remain
or else lose your ability.

195
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,328
Oh, I am quite clear on that point.

196
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,893
But what exactly is the work?

197
00:14:56,969 --> 00:15:01,134
It is to copy out
the encyclopedia Britannica.

198
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,438
There is the first volume.

199
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:07,274
You will supply the ink,
paper and pen.

200
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:10,110
We will supply this desk and chair.

201
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,048
Now would you be free to start
next Monday morning?

202
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,717
Oh, yes,
certainly.

203
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,053
Then once again my congratulations.

204
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:23,791
Mr. Jay Beards Wilson
on the most important position...

205
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:27,291
...you've been fortunate enough to gain.

206
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,168
Wonderful head of hair.

207
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,004
Good bye Mr. Wilson.

208
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,439
Well done Mr. Wilson.

209
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
Well done indeed.

210
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:43,343
This is the quickest way out sir.

211
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,211
Oh.

212
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,311
This way.

213
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,755
When I got home the whole thing seemed...

214
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:57,491
...on reflection to be quite ridiculous.

215
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,659
Why?

216
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,095
Who would make such
an extraordinary will?

217
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:03,764
Not a very generous
millionaire to make you...

218
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,200
...buy your own pen,
ink, and paper.

219
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,335
Exactly Mr. Holmes.

220
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,606
I soon persuaded myself
it was some great hoax or fraud.

221
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:16,610
And then when Monday morning
came along it seemed stupid...

222
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,513
...to turn down a good job...

223
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,483
...so, off I went and bought
a penny bottle of ink...

224
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,019
...and a pen and seven sheets
of fools kept paper.

225
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,456
And I set off for Popes Core.

226
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,575
Good morning,
Mr. Wilson and welcome.

227
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,077
Good morning.

228
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,067
Well to my surprise and delight...

229
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,283
...everything was as right as possible.

230
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,419
The table was set up ready for me...

231
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,056
...and Mr. Duncan Ross was there
to see I got fairly to work.

232
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:06,059
My employment had truly begun.

233
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,695
The schedule never varied.

234
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,433
My work started at 10:00
and ended at 2:00...

235
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,903
...with a small break for my lunch
at half past 12:00.

236
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:19,506
Every Saturday at 2:00
Mr. Ross would come in...

237
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,342
...and give me my money.

238
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,878
Compliment me upon
the amount that I'd written...

239
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,747
...and then we'd both leave.

240
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,349
Mr. Ross locking the door afterwards.

241
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:33,287
The artichokes I found
were positively fascinating.

242
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,123
They have a kind of a bloom on them but...

243
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,326
I thought that was very interesting...

244
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,426
Good Morning.

245
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:51,572
Oh, the work was very interesting.

246
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,440
Abacus,

247
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,142
abbey,

248
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,911
architecture,

249
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,914
acts of the Apostles,

250
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,450
adulteration,

251
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,786
anatomy,

252
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,888
apes,

253
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:11,525
aquaducts.

254
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,461
After eight weeks I'd fairly dealt with...

255
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,497
...the letter 'A' and was
hoping the diligence...

256
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,732
...to get onto 'B' when suddenly
this morning...

257
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,467
...the whole business came to end.

258
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,003
I went to my work as usual
but the door was shut...

259
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,072
...and locked with a little
square of cardboard...

260
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,062
...hammered onto the middle panel.

261
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,114
Oh, excuse me.

262
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,750
Have you seen Mr. Duncan Ross
this morning?

263
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,319
Ross, Ross?

264
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,321
Never heard of a gentleman
with that name, sir...

265
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,623
...and my memory is good.

266
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,124
It's very good,
it's infallible to me.

267
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,793
No, the gentleman in number seven.

268
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,028
Ah, the gentleman who is red headed?

269
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,163
Yes, yes.

270
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:50,664
Uh, yes, yes, yes,
gone.

271
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:51,832
Gone?

272
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:54,234
Mr. William Morris,
solicitor using my room as...

273
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,603
...a temporary convenience
until his new premises were ready.

274
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,872
Moved out yesterday, paid in full,
doesn't owe a penny.

275
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,408
Mr. Morris,
where can I find him?

276
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,977
At his new offices.

277
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:08,248
William Morris...

278
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,618
...17 King Edwards Street,

279
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,053
near St. Paul's.

280
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,153
Oh, thank you.

281
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:06,907
I don't see that there's anything
very funny about it.

282
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:10,144
If all you can do is laugh at me
well I can go elsewhere.

283
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,946
No, Mr. Wilson please,
please sit down.

284
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,683
I wouldn't miss this case for the world.

285
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,953
It is most refreshingly unusual.

286
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:26,293
I was so incensed with
the forgery of deceit...

287
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,729
...that I came straight to you sir.

288
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,165
Having heard of your great reputation...

289
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:33,500
...for helping poor people in distress.

290
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,135
Mr. Wilson.

291
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,872
You know Mr. Wilson
I really don't think that you've got...

292
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,609
...any great grievance against
this extraordinary league.

293
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:46,013
On the contrary you've been
very well paid to say nothing...

294
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,916
...of the detailed knowledge
which you've acquired...

295
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:51,318
...on every subject under the letter A.

296
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:55,322
Yes, but what's the object of them
playing this prank on me?

297
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,802
That is what I want to know.

298
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:04,198
This assistant of yours,
how long has he been with you?

299
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:05,399
Well about three months.

300
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,500
How did he come?

301
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,735
With the answer to an advertisement.

302
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,369
Was he the only applicant?

303
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,139
No, I had 12 others.

304
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,708
Why did you pick him?

305
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:18,412
Well he was handy and would come cheap.

306
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:21,081
At half wages in fact.

307
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:23,215
Yes.

308
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,160
What's he like,
this Vincent Spalding?

309
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,965
Oh, well he's tall,
slightly built...

310
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:41,568
...and he's very quick in his ways.

311
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:45,139
He's got no hair on his face.

312
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:49,543
He's got a white splash of acid
on his forehead.

313
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,583
Uh, have you ever
observed whether his ears...

314
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,652
...have been pierced for earrings?

315
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,438
Yes, yes,
he told me a gypsy...

316
00:22:01,538 --> 00:22:03,791
...had done it for him when he was a lad.

317
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:05,025
He is still with you?

318
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,693
Yes,
I just left him.

319
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,463
Mr. Wilson,
You will be at your shop...

320
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:10,898
...if I should need you?

321
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,500
Well I had thought of shutting up shop...

322
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,003
...at dinner time today
because Vincent had suggested.

323
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:17,905
I spend the rest of the weekend...

324
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,040
...with my sister in Barking.

325
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,110
This whole business
has upset my nerves very much.

326
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,813
Well you enjoy
a restful weekend in Barking.

327
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:27,681
Today's Saturday.

328
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:31,251
By Monday we should have
a conclusion for you.

329
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,886
In the matter of your fee...

330
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,722
Don't worry about that.

331
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:38,307
I believe it will be paid for by another.

332
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,157
Good day to you Mr. Wilson.

333
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:52,439
What do you make of it all Watson?

334
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,541
I make nothing of it.

335
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,577
Most mysterious business.

336
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,645
Yet there are graver issues...

337
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:03,505
...hanging from this affair
then that first had appeared.

338
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:10,290
What are you going to do?

339
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,860
To smoke.

340
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,630
It is quite a three pipe problem...

341
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,320
...and I beg that you won't
speak to me for 50 minutes.

342
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:44,958
The business of the Red Headed League...

343
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,058
...is concluded sir.

344
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,296
Satisfactorily I trust.

345
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:53,067
Most satisfactorily professor
I am pleased to report.

346
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,202
Good.

347
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,372
Come Watson.

348
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:33,472
Huh?

349
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:47,521
Excuse me.

350
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:50,124
Can you tell me the way
to the Strand from here?

351
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:53,393
Uh, third right,
fourth left sir.

352
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:55,494
Thank you.

353
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:00,300
Holmes?

354
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,269
Holmes,
I could have told you that.

355
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,537
No doubt, Watson.

356
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:05,637
What is it?

357
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,344
And why did you beat
the pavement with your stick?

358
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:14,114
Watson we are spies in
an enemy's territory.

359
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,711
It's a hobby of mine...

360
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:46,313
...to have an exact knowledge of London.

361
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:47,915
Now there's Mortimore's,
the tobacconist.

362
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,783
The little newspaper shop.

363
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,453
Coburg Branch,
the City and Suburban Bank.

364
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:54,922
McFarland's Carriage Building Depot...

365
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:57,858
...and the vegetarian
restaurant around the corner.

366
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,627
Watson commit to memory,
it's just possible...

367
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,192
...that we're being observed.

368
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:19,246
A considerable crime's in contemplation.

369
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:22,916
Today being Saturday
somewhat complicates matters.

370
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:28,455
But now doctor...
our work is done.

371
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:30,758
It is time we had some play.

372
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,394
Sarasate's playing at
Sir James Hall this afternoon.

373
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:35,329
A sandwich and a cup of coffee?

374
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,564
And then off to violin land with all...

375
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:40,234
...its sweetness, delicacy and harmony.

376
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:45,179
And no red headed clients
to vex us with their conundrums.

377
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:10,431
All the afternoon he sat in the stalls...

378
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:13,233
...wrapped in the most perfect happiness...

379
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:18,172
...while his gently smiling face,
and his languid dreamy eyes...

380
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:22,042
...were as unlike those
of Holmes the sleuth hound...

381
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,032
...as it was possible to conceive.

382
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:32,287
When I saw him so enwrapped in music.

383
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:36,223
I felt that an evil time
might be coming upon those...

384
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:39,660
...he had set himself to hunt down.

385
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,710
Excellent Watson.

386
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,612
You have a future as a cartographer.

387
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,647
That will be Athelney Jones.

388
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:35,516
I thought it was well enough
to have someone...

389
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:37,017
...from Scotland Yard with us.

390
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:38,819
He's an absolute imbecile
at his profession...

391
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:41,488
...but he does the tenacity
of a lobster when he gets...

392
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:43,223
...his claws into someone.

393
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:44,425
Good evening Jones.

394
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,160
So we're working in couples again.

395
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,261
Mr. Holmes.

396
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:49,930
Our friend is a wonderful man
for starting a chase.

397
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,633
All he needs is an old dog
to help him do the running down.

398
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,102
Mr. Merryweather, my friend
and college Dr. Watson.

399
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,704
How do you do sir?

400
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,539
I only hope a wild goose may not prove...

401
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,474
...to be the end of our chase.

402
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,309
I'm not personally in favor...

403
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,911
...of amateur criminal investigation.

404
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:06,613
You might place considerable
confidence in Mr. Holmes.

405
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,582
Oh, if you say so Mr. Jones.

406
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:11,018
He has his own little methods,
which if he won't...

407
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:12,953
...mind me saying so a little theoretical...

408
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:14,988
...and fantastic,
but he has the makings...

409
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,757
...of a detective in him.

410
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:18,959
But I do say as I've said before...

411
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,961
...the Colburg Branch of the Bank
is as well secured...

412
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,830
...as any building in London.

413
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,532
There isn't a possibility
that it could be broken into.

414
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,035
Even insurance assessors
agree on that point.

415
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,670
And you sir should know...

416
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,239
...being not only the resident
manager but also the director.

417
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,141
I should know and I do know.

418
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:36,577
And what is more,
this is the first time...

419
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:38,779
...for seven and twenty years
that I've missed my.

420
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,581
Saturday night of whiskey at my club.

421
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:41,849
And I find myself
extremely inconvenienced.

422
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,618
I think that you will find the game tonight...

423
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:47,454
...much more exciting
and the stake will be...

424
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:50,699
...for many,
many thousands of pounds.

425
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:53,761
And what will be my reward be Mr. Homes?

426
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,930
A young man,
called Clay.

427
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:59,064
John Clay?

428
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:01,568
Oh, how I'd like to get
my hands on that devil.

429
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:02,903
You shall.

430
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:06,040
This young fellow's
a gentleman as Mr. Holmes says...

431
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,975
...but he's turned against his class.

432
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,777
He's as cunning as the devil.

433
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,312
Slippery as an eel
and he's turned crib cracking...

434
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:13,981
...and forgery into a fine art.

435
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,183
His grandfather was a royal duke...

436
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:19,086
...and he himself was educated
at Eaton and Oxford.

437
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:21,321
So Watson,
bring the gun.

438
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:24,491
Come gentlemen our cab is below.

439
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,659
There are only two keys to the vault.

440
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,997
I have one,
the chairman holds the other...

441
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,137
...in his personal safe.

442
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:22,776
Well you are certainly not
vulnerable from above.

443
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:24,712
Nor from below.

444
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:25,913
Just a minute.

445
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:30,518
I'm going to ask you to be
a little more quiet please.

446
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:53,240
Might I get you to sit
on one of those boxes...

447
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,380
...and not to interfere?

448
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:15,629
There is no way in which a thief...

449
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:18,279
...could break into this bank.

450
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:32,780
Is there a special reason why a thief...

451
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,549
...should want to break into this bank?

452
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,452
Nothing particularly...

453
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:41,622
Something in the past few months?

454
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:45,155
Something that you
had concealed from us?

455
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,528
The information I have is confidential...

456
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:49,997
...known only to the directors of the bank.

457
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,833
It is not to be divulged
to members of the public,

458
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:55,702
not even amateur detectives.

459
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:59,506
Private consulting detective,
Mr. Merryweather.

460
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,076
Unique in the annuls of crime I believe,

461
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:03,744
isn't that so inspector?

462
00:34:03,844 --> 00:34:05,212
Yes, doctor.

463
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:08,082
I advise you to cooperate with Mr. Holmes.

464
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:12,486
Especially as at this moment
I am trying to save your skin...

465
00:34:12,586 --> 00:34:15,222
...and that of your fellow directors.

466
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:17,558
So what is it?

467
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:20,694
Our French gold.

468
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:24,064
We had occasion some months ago
to strengthen our resources...

469
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:26,567
...and borrowed for that purpose
60,000 Napoleons...

470
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,702
...from the bank of France.

471
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:32,639
Therefore our reserve of bullion
is much larger than is usual...

472
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,676
...in such a branch of the bank.

473
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:39,313
Where is this gold?

474
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:43,517
The crates upon which Dr. Watson sits...

475
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,087
...contain 30,000 Napoleons...

476
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:50,536
...wrapped between layers of lead foil.

477
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:55,696
May we see it?

478
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:56,756
This is much bolder
and larger in conception...

479
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,820
...than I had first thought,
wouldn't you say Jones?

480
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,321
I would indeed.

481
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:03,457
This Clay's more of an
amateur adventurer...

482
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,292
...or spur of the moment criminal.

483
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:08,762
Long planning is not Clay's type
at all sir, not at all.

484
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:12,347
Unless he's a pawn in a much larger game.

485
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,904
Mr. Merryweather someone
has had access to...

486
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:19,807
...information of the most confidential sort.

487
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:23,210
Careful plans have been made.

488
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,714
A mastermind has been at work.

489
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:31,752
Are you suggesting that...

490
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:35,322
I am suggesting that it
bears the hallmarks...

491
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,658
...of Professor Moriarity's work.

492
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:41,829
Moriarity?

493
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,174
And who is this Moriarity?

494
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,235
We don't really know sir.

495
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:50,671
That is neither the police nor I think.

496
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:53,173
Mr. Sherlock Holmes
here has ever set eyes on him.

497
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:56,276
His name echoes and re-echoes
throughout the underworld.

498
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:59,279
It appears that he's a man of good birth,

499
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:04,418
an excellent education
but he has hereditary...

500
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:08,922
...tendencies of the most diabolical kind.

501
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:12,026
A criminal strain runs in his blood...

502
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:16,163
...which has increased and rendered
infinitely more dangerous...

503
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:19,233
...by his extraordinary mental powers.

504
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:24,171
He's the organizer of half that
is evil and nearly all that...

505
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:28,108
...is undetected in this great city.

506
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:32,012
He is never caught.

507
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:34,915
His agent is caught but the central power...

508
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:43,423
...is never caught certainly even suspected.

509
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:46,839
We shall not see the professor tonight.

510
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:56,103
The only way for tonight's
enemy to escape is through...

511
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:57,438
...the pawn brokers.

512
00:38:57,538 --> 00:39:00,074
There's already an inspector at the doors.

513
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:02,876
Exactly.

514
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:08,382
We have only a few moments...
positions...

515
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:16,924
Would you be so kind as
to put out this lamp.

516
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,293
And sit in the dark?

517
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:21,393
I'm afraid so.

518
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:24,631
We cannot risk the presence of light.

519
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,743
When I shine the light, act swiftly...

520
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:38,278
If they fire have no compassion...

521
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,758
...about shooting them down.

522
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:49,287
Shhh.

523
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:42,436
Great Scott.

524
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:44,536
Jump at it,
jump.

525
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:59,153
It's no good John Clay.

526
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,463
You have no chance at all.

527
00:42:09,763 --> 00:42:11,565
So I see...

528
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:14,702
...though I fancy my pal's all right.

529
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:16,837
At this moment he is running into...

530
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:19,573
...the welcoming arms of the police.

531
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:22,376
You seem to have done
the thing very completely.

532
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:24,011
I must compliment you.

533
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,579
And I you.

534
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,382
I'm Sherlock Holmes,
a private investigator.

535
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:30,984
I didn't for a moment suspect your being...

536
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:33,087
...a policeman Mr. Holmes.

537
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,189
Come on, hold that one off for the Darby's.

538
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,858
I beg you to take your filthy hands off me.

539
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,727
You may not be aware
that I have royal blood...

540
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:43,397
...in my veins and be so kind
as to say 'sir' and 'please'

541
00:42:43,497 --> 00:42:45,332
when you address me.

542
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:46,600
All right.

543
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,435
Would you please sir,
mind marching upstairs...

544
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:50,504
...while we get a cab to
transport your highness...

545
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,729
...to the police station?

546
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:54,807
That's better.

547
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:02,481
Gentlemen.

548
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,157
Oh, one question Mr. Clay.

549
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:13,127
Am I right in thinking
that professor Moriarity...

550
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:16,730
...was somewhere behind the idea
of the Red Headed League?

551
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:22,236
I suggest you keep that name
off your lips Mr. Holmes...

552
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:25,651
...if you value your future well-being.

553
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:32,579
Really gentlemen,
I don't know what to say.

554
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:35,015
Please forgive me
Mr. Holmes for ever doubting...

555
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,117
...your outstanding,
your brilliant qualities.

556
00:43:37,217 --> 00:43:39,453
There is no doubt
you've detected and defeated...

557
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:41,889
...in the most complete manner
one of the boldest attempts...

558
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,991
...at bank robbery that has ever
come within my experience.

559
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:46,593
Mr. Merryweather I have then some
small expense over this matter.

560
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:50,130
I shall expect the bank to refund.

561
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:53,200
Of course,
of course.

562
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:50,190
It won't do you know...

563
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,960
...it won't do.

564
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:55,229
No Professor.

565
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,831
I'm sorry we failed you.

566
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:01,135
Sherlock Holmes...

567
00:45:01,235 --> 00:45:06,707
Holmes is a mere amateur
in the field of detection.

568
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:17,084
Still he seems a clever man or a lucky one...

569
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:20,854
...and he has a positive talent
for getting in my way.

570
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:23,524
Should he be removed?

571
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:26,860
It may be necessary.

572
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,097
It would be disappointing.

573
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,399
I find him interesting.

574
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:35,335
I believe this is the third time...

575
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:38,005
...he has incommoded me.

576
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:40,741
If this continues then certainly something...

577
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:43,544
...will have to be done
to encourage Mr. Holmes...

578
00:45:43,644 --> 00:45:47,881
...either to withdraw or stand clear.

579
00:45:59,326 --> 00:46:01,395
Thank you.

580
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:22,681
Morning Constable.

581
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,523
Beg your pardon Dr. Watson...

582
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:31,892
...but this has all been too much for me.

583
00:46:31,992 --> 00:46:34,728
My clients respect me
as a man of confidence...

584
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:36,830
...but where's the confidence left here.

585
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,266
I'm utterly ruined...

586
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:41,035
Oh, cheer up Mr. Wilson.

587
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:43,337
You'll feel better when you've
cleared up the mess.

588
00:46:43,437 --> 00:46:45,372
Well that's all very well...

589
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,808
And Mr. Holmes asked me to give you this,

590
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:50,177
50 sovereigns with the compliments...

591
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:52,513
...of the City and Suburban Bank.

592
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:54,515
Well that's fair enough.

593
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:56,817
Oh, Dr. Watson, this
is more than acceptable,

594
00:46:56,917 --> 00:47:00,687
and my compliments
to Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

595
00:47:00,788 --> 00:47:02,923
And he sends the same to you Mr. Wilson...

596
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,725
...and a word of advice...

597
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:07,161
Next time you engage an assistant...

598
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:09,730
...pay him the proper wage.

599
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,830
Good day to you.

600
00:47:27,614 --> 00:47:31,585
Oh, Holmes,
I trust I am not more dense...

601
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:34,455
...than my neighbors and
yet here I have seen...

602
00:47:34,555 --> 00:47:36,990
...what you have seen,
heard what you have heard...

603
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,727
...and yet you have seen clearly
not only what had happened,

604
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:42,596
but what was about to happen
while to me the whole business...

605
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:44,865
...was still confused and grotesque.

606
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:46,965
Dr. Watson recollect,

607
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:50,504
when I heard that the assistant
had come for half wages,

608
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:53,407
it was obvious that he had some motive...

609
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:55,409
...for securing the situation.

610
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:57,578
Yes, but how did
you know what his motive was?

611
00:47:57,678 --> 00:47:59,613
Had there been a woman in
the house I would have...

612
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:02,583
...suspected immediately if
some vulgar intrigue,

613
00:48:02,683 --> 00:48:04,618
but when I heard from Mr. Wilson...

614
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:07,021
...about the acid stain and the pierced ears.

615
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:09,323
I knew that Vincent
Spalding and John Clay...

616
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:10,858
...were the same person.

617
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,327
But why was Clay there?

618
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:15,129
The photography gave you the clue.

619
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:16,263
Exactly.

620
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:19,500
The cellar, he was working
on something in the cellar.

621
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,102
Something which took many hours a day...

622
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:27,741
...for two months on end. He was
tunneling but where to?

623
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:30,010
When I tapped my stick on the pavement...

624
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,646
...in the street that day I was ascertaining...

625
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:35,416
...whether the tunnel stretched
in front or behind the building.

626
00:48:35,516 --> 00:48:39,620
It was in front,
towards the back.

627
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:41,955
Could you tell me the way
to the strand from here?

628
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:45,459
I recognized Clay
immediately and delayed him...

629
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:48,896
...to have time to examine his knees.

630
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:52,599
There he spoke clearly
of many hours or tunneling.

631
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,968
No doubt linking up with
a maze of sewers...

632
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:57,171
...beneath Saxe Coburg Square.

633
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,406
When they closed
the Red Headed League offices,

634
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:01,508
it was a sign they no longer cared about.

635
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:03,644
Jay Beards Wilson's presence.

636
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:05,746
In other words the tunnel was complete.

637
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:08,182
And that they would make
the attempt on a Saturday...

638
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:09,917
...was just a guess?

639
00:49:10,017 --> 00:49:12,386
Watson,
you disappoint me.

640
00:49:12,486 --> 00:49:14,188
I never guess.

641
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:18,425
Saturday's an excellent
night for stealing bullion.

642
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:20,561
It gives you a full day to escape.

643
00:49:20,661 --> 00:49:22,262
Thank you then.

644
00:49:22,362 --> 00:49:24,465
Thank you.

645
00:49:24,598 --> 00:49:27,935
Oh, you've reasoned it out
beautifully Holmes.

646
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:31,705
It's so long a chain
and yet every link rings true.

647
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:33,507
It saved me from irony.

648
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:36,477
You know sometimes I think
my whole life is spent...

649
00:49:36,577 --> 00:49:38,412
...in one long effort to escape from...

650
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:41,015
...the common places of existence.

651
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:42,383
No, no.

652
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:45,019
You are a benefactor of the race Holmes.

653
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,656
Well maybe it is of some little use after all.
