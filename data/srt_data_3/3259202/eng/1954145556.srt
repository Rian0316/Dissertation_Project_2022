1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:01,706
Previously on "The Originals"...

2
00:00:01,707 --> 00:00:04,733
Our community is under attack.

3
00:00:04,734 --> 00:00:06,103
They're
declaring war on us.

4
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:07,623
All his life,
there's only ever been

5
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:09,124
one man he has
truly feared...

6
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,826
My father Mikael.

7
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:11,794
All we need is a witch

8
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:12,928
who could help us
find him.

9
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,862
- Celeste.
- How did you know?

10
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:16,298
If you have come here
seeking revenge...

11
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,716
Oh, I'll have
my revenge,

12
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:18,783
starting with Klaus.

13
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,803
He is gonna know
pain and torment

14
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:22,254
like he's never
felt before.

15
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,307
Then that leaves Rebekah,
your tragic sister.

16
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:26,458
She's about
to find herself

17
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,976
in quite
the predicament.

18
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:30,113
Genevieve knows
where your sister is,

19
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,463
Bastiana has Klaus

20
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,898
tucked away
someplace safe.

21
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,243
I guess always isn't
forever after all.

22
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,164
Who's there?

23
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,618
How the hell did I get here?

24
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:36,521
Genevieve.

25
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:37,973
Rebekah.

26
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:40,142
Tell me you're not
leaving already.

27
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,953
I thought we
might reminisce.

29
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,092
Aah!

30
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,790
My siblings have been taken.
Where are they?

31
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,559
You're interrupting
my aunt Sophie's consecration.

32
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:54,776
How did this happen?

33
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,269
Aunt Sophie was
a casualty of war.

34
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,603
Monique, I recommend
you give me

35
00:03:58,604 --> 00:03:59,938
what I want,
unless, of course,

36
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,356
you'd like me
to level this place

37
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:02,774
and everything in it.

38
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,475
That won't
be necessary.

39
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:08,063
I have a message
for you...

40
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,363
From Celeste.

41
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:27,966
To find what
you're looking for,

42
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,770
follow the path
she left behind.

43
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,422
What the hell are you
doing, you ruthless bitch?

44
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,173
Poor Rebekah.

45
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,020
You should rest.

46
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,095
You're looking
a little peaked.

47
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,966
Uhh! Ow!

48
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:21,238
Of course, that's
to be expected,

49
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,921
given the rather
impressive amount of

50
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,616
werewolf venom
in your system.

51
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,527
How did you like that wolf-boy,
by the way?

52
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,705
I thought he seemed
like your type...

53
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,147
Trashy and willing.

54
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,315
If I weren't
so bloody sick,

55
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:34,501
I'd rip
your head off.

56
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:36,336
But you are sick.

57
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,236
And comforting
the sick always was

58
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,454
a talent of mine.

59
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,541
I take care
of my friends.

60
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,179
We were friends,
weren't we?

61
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,499
Of course we were.

62
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,056
There, there.

63
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:03,811
Unidentified
sick man.

64
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,659
That can't be good.

65
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,818
You. Red.

66
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:21,256
Here. Try to take
a sip of this.

67
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,670
Hmm. Just like magic.

68
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,372
But then again,
what would you expect

69
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,206
from a practicing
witch?

70
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:36,187
It's a simple
herbal remedy.

71
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:39,047
Won't stop the inevitable,
but it should

72
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,882
ease his pain
and quiet his lungs.

73
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,527
For a while,
at least.

74
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,003
You're quite good
at this, miss...

75
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,972
What is your
name again?

76
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,283
Genevieve.

77
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,525
Lovely.

78
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:52,360
Perhaps you could
give me some pointers.

79
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:55,373
Certainly. Though it is a bit odd.

80
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,502
A vampire serving
as nurse.

81
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,237
Please, darling,
I'm an original vampire.

82
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:03,788
If my city
is under attack

83
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:04,940
from this
nasty influenza,

84
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,791
it is my duty
to lend a hand.

85
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,878
Besides, if this
entire lot dies,

86
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,222
who'd be left
to eat?

87
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:13,664
You're wicked.

88
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,034
You know, I think
you and I

89
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,104
are going to be
fast friends.

90
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:20,388
What say you
join me at this

91
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:21,756
swell, little
jazz joint

92
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,558
I've discovered on
basin street tonight?

93
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,342
We can toast to
the health of New Orleans.

94
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:32,327
Oh... I don't know.

95
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,207
You. You should
come, too.

96
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,390
After playing angels
of mercy all day,

97
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,025
I'd say we all
deserve some fun.

98
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:48,885
Uhh.

99
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:03,748
Anything?

100
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,634
They're putting eyes
and ears out everywhere.

101
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,612
Daywalkers are working
every contact we got.

102
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,688
Cops, dock workers,
guys in the treme.

103
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,805
Word is out.

104
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:12,274
Anyone trying to
earn favor with me

105
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,192
gets a lifetime of
it if they find them.

106
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,745
Good. I need
a pen and paper.

107
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,456
Hey.

108
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:20,865
Am I taking orders
from you now?

109
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,701
Or are we
in this together?

110
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,131
Pen and paper, Marcel.
Now.

111
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,291
Look, I want her back just
as much as you do, you know.

112
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,791
Both of them.

113
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,165
Hayley!

114
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,551
Elijah. You're back.

115
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,719
Did you find any... thing?

116
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:46,473
What is happening?

117
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,425
I need you to make
a list of these names.

118
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,644
Please.

119
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,316
Ok.

120
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,984
Sabine...?
Elijah, what is this?

121
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,753
I believe they
represent the names

122
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,204
of the women that
Celeste inhabited

123
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:17,455
for the past
two centuries.

124
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,673
It's called a devinette.

125
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,425
It's old school.
Kind of a riddle.

126
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,326
Witches use them
to teach their kids.

127
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,011
Solve it
and it disappears.

128
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:26,381
Why?
What's the point?

129
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:27,765
Celeste forced me to make a choice

130
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,017
between yourself
and my siblings,

131
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,885
and now she means
to mock that choice,

132
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,003
taunting me

133
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,555
with a childish
game.

134
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:36,057
The longer the game,
the more they suffer.

135
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,676
To find Klaus
and Rebekah,

136
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,862
we need to solve
this riddle.

137
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,698
The solution lies
somewhere in these names.

138
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,699
The name next to
Sabine... Annie LaFleur.

139
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,820
She's a witch that was
shunned from her coven

140
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,954
just over a year ago.

141
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,716
Never knew why,
but I can find out.

142
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,677
You poor thing.

143
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:23,020
Don't worry.
I'm here to help.

144
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:55,478
Annie was
a good girl.

145
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,749
Witches done her wrong,
shunning her like that,

146
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,319
saying that she's doing
dark magic.

147
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,872
There's no way.
But they had proof.

148
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:09,093
So, she just quit.

149
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:12,763
And I can't really
blame her for that.

150
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:14,849
Because once you've
been shunned,

151
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,133
what's the point
of going on, you know?

152
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,005
She killed herself?

153
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:22,273
Yes.
Drowned herself

154
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:24,192
in the Mississippi,
to be precise.

155
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,526
Celeste had clearly
tired of the body

156
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:27,060
and was ready
to take Sabine's.

157
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,362
How do you know that?

158
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:30,615
She leapt to her death
from the very location

159
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,567
Celeste and I had
our first kiss.

160
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,535
Poetic, I guess,
in a creepy,

161
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:35,870
vendetta kind of way.

162
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:37,738
All these names,
these lives,

163
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,790
stolen that Celeste
might take her revenge.

164
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:40,908
I suppose
we have no choice

165
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,793
but to see where
they take us.

166
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,912
Hayley, I have to go.
I'll call you back.

167
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:45,955
Elijah, wait.

168
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,881
What is it?

169
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,536
Ask Marcel if
he knows anything

170
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:56,373
about a name on that list...
Brynne Deveraux.

171
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:58,593
Sophie said that it was
her family's bloodline

172
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,144
that put the curse on
the crescent wolves,

173
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:02,013
but Celeste said that
she was the only one

174
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,212
that could break it.

175
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:05,099
If Brynne Deveraux
was actually Celeste

176
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,901
when she cast
the spell, then

177
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:09,062
maybe Celeste can
still break it.

178
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,980
I'll see
what he knows.

179
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,108
Elijah, I'm really sorry

180
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,692
that you're going
through this.

181
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,613
If I had known that
Celeste had made you

182
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:19,914
choose who to help...

183
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,449
You were going to
die in that fire, Hayley,

184
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,949
along with my
brother's child.

185
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:25,919
There was no choice.

186
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:35,963
My wound isn't healing.

187
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,181
The amount of dark magic
contained in that blade?

188
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:39,683
It's gonna take
a little while.

189
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,334
You're one of them,
aren't you?

190
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,514
The witches
back from the dead,

191
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,849
seeking vengeance.

192
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,725
Why show me kindness?

193
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,691
You never did
anything to me.

194
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,102
And the truth is,
seeing you like this,

195
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:00,279
I can't help
but pity you.

196
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:03,741
Then betray the others
and stand with me.

197
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:06,210
I will reward you

198
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:09,329
in ways you cannot
possibly fathom.

199
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:14,168
Klaus Mikaelson
offering a deal

200
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,170
to little ol' me?

201
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,088
I should be flattered.

202
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,760
But first... we need
to have a talk

203
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,227
about your sister.

204
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,850
Rebekah is of
no concern to you.

205
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,935
If you mean
to harm her...

206
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,396
Ah, the protective brother.

207
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,822
A shame that loyalty
isn't reciprocated.

208
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:38,159
But then,
I'm no stranger

209
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,492
to Rebekah's treachery.

210
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:43,079
Something you and I
have in common.

211
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,866
Here. Drink.

212
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,323
I'm just trying
to help you.

213
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:56,344
Heal you. Get you to see the truth

214
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:57,678
that's been right
in front of you

215
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,255
for almost
a century.

216
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,011
Your sister had
an unfortunate run-in

217
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,196
with some wolves
last night.

218
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:16,697
I imagine you're
tasting the venom

219
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:17,982
in her blood.

220
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:20,451
It's the only way
I can show you

221
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:21,736
what you need to see.

222
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,211
In her weakened state,
I'll be able to guide her

223
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:32,463
down memory Lane.

224
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:34,582
That's how I'm going
to have my revenge.

225
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,668
By showing you
her betrayal.

226
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,341
Niklaus.

227
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,741
Marcel.
Have some respect.

228
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:20,427
Yeah, I don't
think they mind.

229
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:27,383
Did you ask Genevieve
about doing the spell?

230
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:32,273
I will.
When the time is right.

231
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,308
Rebekah.
You've been hanging around

232
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,860
that witch for weeks,
waiting for the time

233
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:37,261
to be right.

234
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:39,612
She wasn't supposed
to become your sidekick.

235
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:44,784
One little spell and we could
finally be together for real.

236
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,705
What are you
waiting for?

237
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,374
She's a sweet girl,
is all.

238
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,127
If you must know, I feel
badly for using her.

239
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:54,611
Then we'll find
another witch,

240
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:56,579
one you don't have
to fake a friendship with.

241
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,470
Unless you've changed
your mind.

242
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,226
I want to wake up
with you in our home,

243
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:11,053
in the bed
that we share.

244
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,980
I want to walk down
the street with you by my side

245
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:15,483
so that everyone knows
that you are mine

246
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:16,649
and I am yours.

247
00:16:17,736 --> 00:16:18,788
I don't want
to be afraid

248
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,006
of what my brother
will do to me

249
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:21,397
for loving you.

250
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:24,826
If this is the only way
to get it, then...

251
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:28,513
No, my mind
hasn't changed.

252
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:46,949
Oh! I didn't know
anyone was in here.

253
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:48,254
I'm so sorry.

254
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:51,453
Genevieve...

255
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,540
Genevieve, wait...

256
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:01,546
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,441
So, this is your
great betrayal.

258
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,553
My sister and Marcel.

259
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:09,338
They've been sneaking around
behind my back

260
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,891
for the better part
of two centuries.

261
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,409
Yes. Against all
your warnings.

262
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:17,513
You'd disciplined
them for it before,

263
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,782
had you not?

264
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:21,901
Harshly,
I understand.

265
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:23,469
I had my reasons.

266
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,378
Oh, you don't have
to convince me.

267
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:28,357
As far as
I'm concerned,

268
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:29,741
you only needed one:

269
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,094
That it suited you.

270
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:38,867
Have you ever read
the old testament, Nik?

271
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:44,438
You see...
God wasn't powerful

272
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,091
because he was right...

273
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:51,129
He was right
because he was powerful.

274
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,551
I don't know what
you're playing at,

275
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:57,336
but if the sum total
of your plan

276
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:58,721
to turn me
against my sister

277
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,389
was this revelation,

278
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:03,542
this will have been
a wholly ineffective endeavor.

279
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:05,251
You poor thing.

280
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,146
After 1,000 years,

281
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:08,514
dishonesty from
your family

282
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:10,065
has come
to be expected.

283
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,868
I wish that was

284
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:15,738
the sum total
of their treachery.

285
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,655
Unfortunately, it's not.

286
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:33,972
W-what do you want
from me?

287
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:39,095
Well, I assume
you're familiar

288
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:41,230
with this pigsty,

289
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:44,248
quite appropriately
known as the pit.

290
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:47,319
See, awkwardly enough,
only weeks ago,

291
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,462
a group of human beings
just like yourself

292
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,157
slaughtered many of
the companions

293
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:53,692
of the vampires that
you see assembled

294
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:54,925
before you here.

295
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:57,246
You run
the records room at city hall.

296
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:59,415
We're told the former mayor
kept a detailed record

297
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,400
of the supernatural
community.

298
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,919
A ledger of names of witches,
werewolves, and vampires.

299
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,338
Specifically, their
death records.

300
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:07,188
We need it.

301
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:09,175
I-I don't know
where it is.

302
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:10,676
I think we both
know that's a fib.

303
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:12,318
Anyone feeling hungry?

304
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:15,321
Oh! Ok. W-wait.

305
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,103
They moved the records.
After the mayor died.

306
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:24,473
They're at the sacristy
of St. Anne's church.

307
00:19:24,474 --> 00:19:27,859
See? There.

308
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:31,780
Wasn't so difficult,
now, was it?

309
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,877
Aah!

310
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,250
Rough day?

311
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,444
Oh, becks.

312
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,030
Those bites are
looking nasty.

313
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:03,536
Why make me
relive the past?

314
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,979
We both know
how it ends.

315
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,798
You and I both know.

316
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,852
But I thought your brother
might like to hear our story.

317
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:12,738
So, I linked
your mind to his.

318
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:14,490
You're gonna
show him everything.

319
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:18,092
No. No, please don't do that to me.
I'll do anything.

320
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,745
It's too late, friend.

321
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,700
Aah!

322
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,302
Marcel, here's another
name from our list.

323
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:55,685
Brynne Deveraux.

324
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,555
Says here she drowned herself
some 20 years ago.

325
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,257
Do you recognize
the name?

326
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,392
Brynne? Yeah.
Yeah, we used to hang out.

327
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,510
Knock around a bit.

328
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,961
You can spare me
the details, please.

329
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,514
She used to do some spells
for me now and then.

330
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,931
Girl had power.

331
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,651
Cursed a whole pack
of werewolves

332
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:12,737
just because they
were pissing me off.

333
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,189
Speaking of...
What do you think

334
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,640
Klaus is gonna do
when he finds out

335
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,309
that you left him
to suffer

336
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,077
while you saved Hayley
and her wolf friends?

337
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,412
Let's avoid discussing
matters that are

338
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,164
not your concern,
shall we, Marcellus?

339
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:25,533
Oh, come on, Elijah.
I got guys all over this city.

340
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,917
You honestly think
that I don't know

341
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,412
that the crescent
wolves had a little

342
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,822
family reunion out at
the plantation last night?

343
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,175
Thanks for letting the house burn,
by the way.

344
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:35,169
Good riddance.

345
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,338
But my question is,

346
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,063
what's Hayley doing
with that bunch?

347
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,381
Marcel, I'm aware
of your history

348
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,966
with the city's wolves,
and I assume

349
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,435
you understand that if you
lay a finger upon Hayley,

350
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,603
it will be the last
thing you do on this earth.

351
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:49,439
I see I hit a nerve.

352
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:52,475
And just when we
were getting along.

353
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,980
We were right.

354
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:57,848
Every name
upon my flesh signifies

355
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,034
a witch who died
by her own hand.

356
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,702
All but one.

357
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:03,072
Clara Summerlin.

358
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:05,622
Ring any bells?

359
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,524
None.
Ok, well,

360
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:08,626
if she didn't
off herself,

361
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,677
then how'd she die?

362
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:12,045
Influenza.
Epidemic of 1919.

363
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:28,555
I suppose we have
our answer.

364
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:32,649
Only I have no idea
what it means.

365
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,596
No.

366
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:08,885
No! Please! Uhh!

367
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,528
Your sister's tryst
with Marcel

368
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,895
was only
the beginning.

369
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,284
You see, the burden
of your condemnation

370
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:24,902
had become
too great.

371
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,988
And as a result,
your deepest fear came to pass.

372
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,206
That their love
for each other

373
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,826
would overshadow
their love for you,

374
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,829
turn it into hate.

375
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,163
Nik, they conspired

376
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,298
to rid themselves
of you for good.

377
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,472
Yeah!

378
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,980
An abomination
of nature?

379
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:54,183
You're anything but.

380
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:01,805
Ok, next round's
on me.

381
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:04,525
Clara Summerlin, no.
I'll be soused.

382
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,743
Get it while you can.
It's the last

383
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,446
real gin in the city.

384
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:13,700
Bartender?

385
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,122
You're nothing like
I thought you'd be

386
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,840
when I first met you.

387
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:23,627
I was brought up to think
your kind were... well...

388
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,922
An abomination of nature?

389
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,549
You're anything bug

390
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,434
not just you,
your whole family is so...

391
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,183
Elegant.

392
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,360
Yes, I agree.
Elijah is quite peerless.

393
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:42,112
I don't know.
I mean, he's nice and all, but

394
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,564
if I had to go
for one Mikaelson boy...

395
00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:47,111
Klaus?

396
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:49,954
Genevieve, who'd
have thought

397
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,705
a saintly, little
witch like you

398
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:53,367
would go for
the bad boys?

399
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,459
I knew we were
destined to be friends.

400
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:00,582
More gin, please.

401
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:03,961
Please.

402
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:06,386
Allow me.

403
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:15,979
Keep it.
It's yours.

404
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,436
Well, there's a load
of us Mikaelsons.

405
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,071
If you like bad
boys, you'd love

406
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:25,482
my brother Kol.

407
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:29,695
And where is this
mystery brother of yours?

408
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,563
It's complicated.

409
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,415
Like all siblings,
we've had our

410
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,833
ups and downs.

411
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,083
Family feuds.

412
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:41,705
In fact, I was
thinking of

413
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,290
reaching out to
someone we haven't seen

414
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,924
in a very
long while.

415
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,329
I was hoping that
maybe you could

416
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,798
help me contact them.

417
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,600
But it would have
to be a surprise.

418
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,553
No one could know.

419
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:56,920
Of course.

420
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,388
Do you want me to find
your brother Kol?

421
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:03,604
Actually, I'd like
you to find Mikael.

422
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,779
Our father.

423
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,931
Enough of your lies!

424
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:09,967
Don't dismember
the messenger.

425
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,886
Part of you
must have known.

426
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,655
Suspected, at least.

427
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,274
Your father came
to New Orleans

428
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,811
in 1919 to kill you,
did he not?

429
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,580
And as the city burned,
he nearly succeeded.

430
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,519
My family and I have done

431
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,673
some terrible things to
each other over the years,

432
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,475
but Rebekah would not
call my father.

433
00:26:38,646 --> 00:26:40,933
No matter how angry she was.

434
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,519
It's sweet of you
to believe that.

435
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:47,321
To believe in her.

436
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:48,906
But by the time
we're done here,

437
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,707
you'll know just
how wrong you are.

438
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,974
Hey, look,
I found...

439
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:10,996
You were right about
the Deveraux witch.

440
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,949
Find anything about
Clara the mystery witch?

441
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,867
Not much.
She was a nurse

442
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,985
at the Fleur-de-lis
sanitorium.

443
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:20,955
Recognize her?

444
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:22,790
Top row,
second from the right.

445
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:25,936
No. I don't.

446
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,022
Marcel?

447
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:31,916
Marcel?

448
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,670
Do I need to remind you
that Niklaus and Rebekah

449
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:36,972
are somewhere
suffering horribly?

450
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:40,424
If you know something...
Talk.

451
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,913
The sanitorium.
That's where you'll find then.

452
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,181
Are you sure?
How do you know?

453
00:27:47,183 --> 00:27:48,183
I just know.

454
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,167
How do you know?

455
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,826
If I'm right...

456
00:27:57,827 --> 00:27:59,194
You need
to know exactly

457
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:01,746
what we're
walking into.

458
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,697
We did something,
Rebekah and I.

459
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,386
I think the witches are
trying to use it against her.

460
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:14,386
It's... something
that you're not gonna like.

461
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,947
Are you ready
to see more proof?

462
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,641
No.

463
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,637
What do you see?

464
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:00,872
My father's blade.

465
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,773
It went missing
when I was a boy.

466
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,077
He beat me
half to death,

467
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,345
so sure I had
stolen it.

468
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:10,899
Rebekah was
so kind to me

469
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,267
in the weeks
after the beating.

470
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:15,237
I should have known
she was the culprit.

471
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:17,105
She never could
stand weapons

472
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:19,440
were things not meant
for guns.

473
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:22,177
Pran ce mesaj sa a,
les cendres sur le vent.

474
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,596
No! Klaus!

475
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:43,047
My sister.

476
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:55,010
Rebekah.
Rebekah!

477
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:56,194
For the better part
of a century,

478
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:57,696
I have wondered how
father found us,

479
00:29:57,697 --> 00:29:59,447
what foolish mistake
that we had made

480
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,116
to destroy our time
in the one place

481
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:02,426
that we could
finally call home.

482
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,452
Did you know, I even
blamed myself

483
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:06,236
for a time,
marcellus?

484
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:10,158
Elijah.

485
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,277
Niklaus treated you
like a son.

486
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:14,104
Rebekah...
I loved her.

487
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,830
I still love her.

488
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,448
All we ever wanted
was to be together,

489
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,616
but as long as
Klaus was around,

490
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:19,968
that was never
gonna happen.

491
00:30:19,969 --> 00:30:22,053
But hey, I guess
you wouldn't know

492
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,804
anything about
that, huh?

493
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:31,229
When Klaus
learns the truth,

494
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,647
there will be
no end to his rage.

495
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:35,517
I will not
let my sister

496
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:37,017
suffer that wrath.

497
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:42,240
Then we need
to get to them

498
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:43,967
before he learns
the truth.

499
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,940
Just give
it up, Rebekah.

500
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:03,570
It's inevitable
at this point.

501
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:06,156
Sabine.

502
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,948
I prefer
Celeste, actually.

503
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:12,102
All these names I've
had over the years

504
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,654
and I still prefer
the first.

505
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:15,322
Perhaps it was
the way it sounded

506
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:16,833
on Elijah's lips,

507
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,826
like a declaration
of love.

508
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:20,910
Oh, he was
a good liar.

509
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:23,830
All of you are.

510
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:24,965
Say what you
want about me,

511
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,510
but Elijah is
a good man.

512
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,018
Still defending him,

513
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,803
even until
the bitter end.

514
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:35,509
Good. I'm counting
on that familial love.

515
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,127
It'll be the ruin
of you all.

516
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,646
Now that Klaus knows
what you've done,

517
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,648
he'll never stop until
he's had his revenge.

518
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,901
He'll kill Marcel.
Do something horrible to you.

519
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,112
Elijah will never
forgive him.

520
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,988
Your betrayal
will ultimately

521
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,157
pit brother
against brother.

522
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,975
And the fabled Mikaelson
bond will crumble.

523
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,246
I'll kill you,
you bitch.

524
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,372
You already did.

525
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:59,282
Though at the time,
I wore a different face.

526
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:13,429
Genevieve, we need to talk.
Privately.

527
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,517
I'll be fine here.
You go ahead.

528
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,719
You should
wash up anyway.

529
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,522
Hey.

530
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,388
Incinerate that
as soon as you can.

531
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:30,115
You were the other one.
Clara.

532
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,033
You should have minded
your own business.

533
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,236
I suspected my friend
was being exploited.

534
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:37,353
It was my business.

535
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,874
Call it off?
Are you mad?

536
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,791
I was wrong.
It was stupid

537
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,359
and... and impulsive,

538
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,462
and it will
ruin us, Genevieve.

539
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,297
Not just Klaus
but Elijah, too.

540
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,216
I risked tearing
our family apart

541
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,594
for my own
selfish happiness.

542
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,263
I'm begging you,
please,

543
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,921
don't bring
Mikael here.

544
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,708
If Klaus finds out
what we have done,

545
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,510
what you
have done...

546
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,732
Klaus will kill me.

547
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,109
He'll kill
my entire family.

548
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,401
Which is exactly why
I need you to undo it.

549
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,820
It doesn't
work that way.

550
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,105
There is no
undoing it.

551
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:13,573
Mikael is coming.
The only hope now...

552
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,277
Is tell Klaus
the truth.

553
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:17,411
Confess what
we've done.

554
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,562
That is not an option.

555
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,864
He will dagger me
and leave me

556
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:20,865
in a box for centuries.

557
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,248
You will not say a word.

558
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:27,754
You used me.

559
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,292
This whole time.
Our friendship.

560
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:32,409
All you wanted
was a favor,

561
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,261
and now you want
to take it back?

562
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,680
Well, you can't.
And I will not suffer

563
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,515
because I was foolish
enough to trust you.

564
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,061
It was a mistake.
I know that now.

565
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,304
But that one mistake
will destroy us.

566
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:45,306
Aah!

567
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,640
Uhh! Aah!

568
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,693
You brought this
on yourself.

569
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,571
I will not be destroyed
along with you.

570
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,401
Uhh!

571
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,319
I'm so sorry, Genevieve.

572
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:02,740
But if you tell Niklaus
you summoned Mikael,

573
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,167
you're dead either way.

574
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:07,710
Genevieve,
is everything all right?

575
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,619
So, you infected
me, too.

576
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,505
Compelled the orderlies
to keep us in quarantine

577
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:19,889
until we died.

578
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,536
Fortunately,
I just took another body.

579
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:51,537
Genevieve wasn't so lucky.

580
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:57,794
Well, now that
she's back...

581
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,180
You're the one
who's luck's run out.

582
00:35:05,386 --> 00:35:06,703
I'm sorry.

583
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:10,924
I know how much
this hurts.

584
00:35:10,925 --> 00:35:12,558
To see what she did...

585
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,029
To see who
she really is.

586
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,899
But you needed
to know.

587
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:23,329
You needed to see it.

588
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:27,940
And now that you have,
you can take your revenge.

589
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:31,911
Our revenge.

590
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:40,096
Please. Go ahead.

591
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,839
You'll need your strength
for what comes next.

592
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,906
Rebekah!

593
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,327
Rebekah!

594
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,631
We should divide
the building.

595
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,332
I'll start at one end,
you at the other.

596
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:31,166
Nik. Nik,
it isn't true.

597
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,602
I want to believe
you, sister.

598
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,381
But your face tells
a different story.

599
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,472
You cannot hide
from me, Rebekah!

600
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:49,919
Nor can you run.

601
00:37:51,204 --> 00:37:52,671
This ends now.

602
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:05,467
Uhh!

603
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:08,554
Hey, there,
witch bitch.

604
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:13,058
You and I are gonna
have a little chat.

605
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:16,062
Rebekah!

606
00:38:43,306 --> 00:38:44,840
Tired of running?

607
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:49,535
I know how much
you enjoy the chase.

608
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:52,131
I'd sooner deny you
the pleasure.

609
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,401
Well, then I'll take my
pleasures in other ways.

610
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:58,586
No more "daggered
in a box" for you.

611
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:02,609
Trust me, sister,
you'll long for what

612
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,883
the dagger offered.

613
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:07,981
This... will be
far less merciful.

614
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:12,819
How to describe exactly
what this blade does?

615
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,421
You don't have
to do this, Nik.

616
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:17,207
After I plunge this
into your heart,

617
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,342
you will be immobilized,

618
00:39:19,343 --> 00:39:21,511
imprispred in a state

619
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:24,848
of raw,
inescapable anguish.

620
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:26,906
Time loses all meaning.

621
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,835
It's not unlike
a living hell,

622
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,536
which I find rather fitting
given your treachery.

623
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,701
Then do it.

624
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,607
If that's what
you really want.

625
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:39,695
Are we skipping the part
where you beg for mercy?

626
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,031
For forgiveness?

627
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:45,985
Because I was really
looking forward to that.

628
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:50,489
I'll pass.

629
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:53,293
I know better
than to think

630
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,877
it would do me
any good.

631
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:59,081
That's it, then?

632
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:01,917
You concede?

633
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,171
Like a lamb
to the slaughter.

634
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:10,676
What would your father
think of you now?

635
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:32,513
Uhh!

636
00:40:32,783 --> 00:40:34,583
Aah! Uhh!

637
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:40,372
Uhh! Aah!

638
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,425
Uhh!

639
00:40:45,628 --> 00:40:47,180
Uhh!

640
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:49,515
Just the man
I wanted to see.

641
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:51,184
Uhh.

642
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:52,936
Rebekah's punishment
won't be complete

643
00:40:52,937 --> 00:40:54,786
until she watches
you die.

644
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,538
Nik, it was my idea
to summon Mikael.

645
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,292
If you're gonna hurt anyone,
it should be me.

646
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,395
Such loyalty
to your beloved.

647
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:13,623
You know...
If you had offered me

648
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:15,542
even a fraction
of the same,

649
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:17,242
I wouldn't have
to do this.

650
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:22,247
Uhhaah!

651
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:25,146
Ohh!

652
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,486
Uhh!

653
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:36,536
Go.

654
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:42,102
Both of you.
Run as far and as fast as you can.

655
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:43,268
Run!

656
