Of course I'll stay.

You'd stay
if the roles were reversed.

222

Absolutely, I would.

223
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,164
You wouldn't even need
to be in the hospital.

224
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:12,209
I'd watch you sleep

551
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,137
- Let me. [laughs]
- Would you?

552
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,617
- I can't do it.
- [sighs]

553
