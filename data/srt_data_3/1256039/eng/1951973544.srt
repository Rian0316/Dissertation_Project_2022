1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,330
Oh,look, Saturn 3is on.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,770
I don't want to watch Saturn
3. Deep Space Nine is better.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,590
How isDeep Space
Ninebetter thanSaturn 3?

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,860
Simple subtraction will
tell you it's six better.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,500
Compromise. WatchBabylon 5.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,390
In what sense is that a compromise?

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,030
Well,five is partway between three...

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,950
Never mind.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,560
I'll tell you what. How about
we go rock-paper-scissors?

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,460
Ooh,I don't think so.

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,530
Anecdotal evidence suggests that
in the game of rock-paper-scissors,

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,580
players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80%
of the time due to the limited number of outcomes.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,130
I suggest rock-paper-scissors-
lizard-Spock.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,620
What?

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,510
It's very simple.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,790
Scissors cuts paper.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,970
Paper covers rock.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,210
Rock crushes lizard.

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,710
Lizard poisons Spock.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,040
Spock smashes scissors.

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,500
Scissors decapitates lizard.

22
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,510
Lizard eats paper.

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,840
Paper disproves Spock.

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,460
Spock vaporizes rock.

25
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,260
And as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.

26
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,780
Okay,I think I got it.

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,140
Rock-paper-scissors-
lizard-Spock!

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,230
Hello,boys.

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,950
Ahoy,matey.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,790
Noticed the eye patch,did you?

31
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,530
It's all part of a technique I've
been studying for picking up women.

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,780
You employ a visual display designed to
make yourself distinctive and memorable.

33
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,980
Oh,yes,like the male peacock with brilliant plumage
or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,120
Or in this case,the bar
mitzvah boy with pinkeye.

35
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,350
Mock me if you will, but it works.

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,720
You show up at a club in something distinctive,
scope out your target and toss out some negs.

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,610
What are negs?

38
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,180
A neg is a negative compliment that
throws a pretty woman off her game,

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,870
like "Normally,I'm not turned on
by big teeth, but on you,they work."

40
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,900
I got a whole list of 'em.
Who wants to be my wingman?

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,920
You're not gonna need a wingman.

42
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,310
You're gonna need a paramedic.

43
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,760
Howard,your scooter's blocking my car.

44
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,180
Aw,did you get pinkeye again?

45
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,020
Step one: she notices the eye patch.

46
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,050
May I say,Penny, not a lot of women could
look as hot as you do with such greasy hair?

47
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,700
Yeah,just move your stupid scooter before
I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.

48

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm sorry,but I'm not going to watchThe Clone
WarsTV series until I've seen The Clone Warsmovie.

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,030
I prefer to let George Lucas
disappoint me in the order he intended.

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,010
Well,I want to watch it now.

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,410
Then I believe we've arrived at another quintessential
rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.

55
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,800
Watch whatever you want.

56
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,510
I saw what you did there.

57
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,900
What'd I do?

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,190
Hello. Hey,Howard. What's wrong?

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,150
Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,120
What happened?

61
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,560
Howard's at the Mars Rover
lab. He says he's in trouble.

62
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,080
- Defcon 5.
- Defcon 5?

63
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,070
Well,there's no need to rush.

64
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,090
What?

65
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,800
Defcon 5 means "no danger."

66
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,860
Defcon 1 is a cris.

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,930
How can 5 not be worse than 1?

68
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,220
Yeah,Star Trek V worse thanI.

69
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,030
Okay,first of all, that's a
comparison of quality, not intensity.

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,860
Secondly,Star Trek I is
orders-of-magnitude worse thanStar Trek V.

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,980
Are you joking?

72
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,290
Star Trek Vis the standard against
which all badness is measured.

73
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,170
No,no.

74
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,110
Star Trek V has specific
failures in writing and direction,

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,200
whileStar Trek Ifails across the board: art
direction,costuming, music,sound editing.

76
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,900
Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,950
Star Trek V.

78
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,170
All right,will you at least stipulate thatStar
Trek IV: The Voyage Homeis inarguably the best?

79
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,420
I have three words
for you: Wrath of Khan.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,510
- Oh,thank God, you're here.
- What's the emergency?

81
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,890
I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.

82
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,940
Where?

83
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,330
On a dusty highway just
outside Bakersfield.

84
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,720
Where do you think? On Mars!

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,870
Howard, is everything okay?

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,900
Yeah,baby,I'll be right in.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,420
You brought a girl to the
Mars Rover control room?

88
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,030
Yeah,I picked her up in
the bar. She's a doctor.

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,570
One free barium enema, and my
mother won't care she's not Jewish.

90
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,990
Wait a minute. So the eye
patch and the insults worked?

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,440
No,there were three other
guys with eye patches.

92
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,250
It was a fiasco.

93
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,320
What did work was, "How'd you like to
visit a secret government facility?"

94
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,090
So what exactly do you want us to do?

95
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,230
I need you and Raj to help me
get the Rover out of the ditch

96
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,770
and I need you to get Stephanie out
before somebody notices she's here.

97
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,240
She doesn't exactly have clearance.

98
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,770
Really? They don't let
strange women from honky-tonks

99
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,960
come in and play with $200 million
government projects on distant planets?

100
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,290
Yes,I was bad.

101
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,560
Maybe she'll spank me.

102
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,800
Can we please move on?

103
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,810
Hey,Howard,you know, it's getting late,
so do I get to drive this thing or what?

104
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,090
Yeah. No. I'm sorry,
but something's come up.

105
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,380
Kind of a Mars Rover...

106
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,940
Mars Rover can Howard come over...

107
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,240
situation.

108
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,140
So my friend Leonard
is gonna take you home.

109
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,860
- Oh,okay. Let's go, friend Leonard.
- Okay.

110
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,930
- I'll call ya.
- Yeah.

111
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,080
So are you a scientist like Howard?

112
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,880
No one's a scientist like Howard.

113
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,420
My mother is so gonna love her.

114
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,040
How nice. Maybe they can carpool
when they visit you in federal prison.

115
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm sorry. I totally interrupted you.

116
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,020
What,what, what were you saying?

117
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,710
Just said Howard's a terrific guy.

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,810
He's got a great sense of humor.

119
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,790
He loves his mother... a lot.

120
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
People say "too much."

121
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,440
I really like that you're
such a loyal friend.

122
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,890
Yeah,I am loyal.

123
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,380
You know,if you look at the big picture.

124
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,200
Out of curiosity, did he
ever have a shot with you?

125
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,810
Are you insane? The guy
was wearing an eye patch.

126
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,030
Then why did you...

127
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,390
He said that I could
drive a car on Mars.

128
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,600
Got it.

129
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,920
So,can I see you again?

130
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,270
You're not gonna see me now.

131
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,470
Cool.

132
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,140
Anything?

133
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,440
Actually,I was just checking my e-mail.

134
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,540
But,uh,no,the Rover is not responding.

135
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,140
I believe the appropriate metaphor
here involves a river of excrement

136
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,390
and a Native American water vessel
without any means of propulsion.

137
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,820
Hang on. There's got
to be other options.

138
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,710
You could try calling Triple-A.

139
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,470
But based on NASA's latest timetable,
they won't get there for 35 years.

140
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,810
Plus I understand you have to be standing next
to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.

141
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,790
Oh,snap.

142
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,260
Snap what?

143
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,130
Okay,I guess we have to turn to Plan B.

144
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,910
What's Plan B?

145
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,940
Erase all the hard drives,
scrap the surveillance tapes,

146
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,880
wipe our fingerprints
off every surface and run.

147
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,320
Why wasn't that Plan A?

148
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,380
A NASA spokesman states
that due to the loss of data,

149
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,330
they will most likely be unable to determine
the cause of the Mars Rover's malfunction.

150
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,580
This is not the first time an exploratory
mission to Mars has ended in disappointment.

151
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,740
Thank God for Plan B.

152
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,720
Howard,didn't you say you
worked on the Mars Rover?

153
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,520
No,you're mistaken.

154
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,940
Yeah,when we first met, you said that if I
went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.

155
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

156
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,600
Will you all excuse me?

157
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,810
Leonard is subtly signaling that
he'd like to talk to me in private.

158
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,070
No. Yeah,I remember specifically.

159
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,410
You started by asking if I was from Mars
because my ass was out of this world.

160
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,290
Well,that does sound like me, but no.

161
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,610
- Is there some problem?
- Yeah.

162
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,120
Listen,I have to kinda
sneak out for a while.

163
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,440
All right,good-bye.

164
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,240
No,wait!

165
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,110
If anyone asks you where
I went, you don't know.

166
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,540
Whereareyou going?

167
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,720
I can't tell you that.

168
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,520
Who would ask me?

169
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,550
I can't tell you that,either.

170
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,820
So you brought me in here to
inform me that you can't tell me

171
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,870
where you're going and you
can't tell me who might ask?

172
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,420
Yeah,I really didn't think this through.

173
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,550
- Leonard,a moment.
- What?

174
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,170
If someone-- and of course,we
don't know who this would be--

175
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,890
does ask where you've
gone, what should I say?

176
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,250
I don't know. Just tell
'em I went to the office.

177
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,230
- Are you going to the office?
- No.

178
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,350
Then how can I say it convincingly?

179
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,590
Just say,"Leonard went totheoffice."

180
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,520
All right. Leonard went tothe office.

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,470
What is... No,not like that!

182
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,930
Just,"Leonard went to the office."

183
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,140
This would have worked out a lot better if
you'd just told me you were going to the office.

184
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm going to the office.

185
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,150
See? Why don't I believe you?

186
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,810
I'm going out for a while.

187
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,400
Okay.

188
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,530
Doesn't anyone want to
know where he's going?

189
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,970
Okay,where is he going?

190
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,830
Leonard is going tothe office.

191
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,150
So how was work today?

192
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,190
Busy.

193
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,990
I removed an appendix, a gall bladder
and about a foot and a half of bowel.

194
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,530
I'm hoping that's three different guys.

195
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,670
No,just the one.

196
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,710
He didn't make it.

197
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,400
So,how was your day?

198
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,270
Oh,you know,I'm a physicist,so...
I thought about stuff.

199
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,880
That's it?

200
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,470
Well,I wrote some of it down.

201
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,390
Are you done eating?

202
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,110
- Uh,yeah.
- Oh,good.

203
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,030
If I knew you were waiting, I
would've swallowed that lasagna whole.

204
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,090
You've reached Dr. Stephanie
Barnett. Leave a message.

205
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,660
Hey,Steph, it's me again,Howard.

206
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,390
Listen,if you're free Friday, maybe we could
have a little something to eat at my place.

207
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,440
My mom cooks a hell of a brisket.

208
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,290
Let me know. It's Howard.

209
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,670
I've had her brisket.
Melts in your mouth.

210
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,750
Maybe we should think
about going to the bedroom.

211
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,780
That's a good idea.

212
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,820
There's a bed in there, and
I'm very... very,very pro-bed.

213
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,500
You've reached Dr. Stephanie
Barnett. Leave a message.

214
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,730
Hey,it's me again.

215
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,380
Just want to let you know the head
count for dinner Friday has gone up.

216
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,190
My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot
are coming in from Palm Springs.

217
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:51,510
Oh,and if anybody should ask, you're
half-Jewish on your mother's side.

218
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,700
Okay,call me. It's Howard.

219
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,170
Don't you think we should
tell him you're not interested?

220
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,340
Do you want me to stop and
call him back right now?

221
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,260
Dear God,no!

222
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,560
Oh,Leonard...

223
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,620
You've reached Dr. Stephanie
Barnett. Leave a message.

224
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,550
Hey,it's me again. Howard.

225
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,630
Listen,my cousins from Fort
Lauderdale are flying in to meet you

226
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,740
so that means we're gonna have to
move the dinner to a restaurant.

227
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,090
Tell her we're going
to the Olive Garden!

228
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,660
I have a coupon from the paper.

229
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,010
We're not going to the Olive Garden,Mom!

230
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,400
Oh,Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.

231
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,390
I'll call you back when
we firm up the details.

232
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,550
It's Howard.

233
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,840
- New shirts?
- Yeah,a couple.

234
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,340
- Nice.
- Thank you.

235
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,050
So,who's the girl?

236
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry?

237
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,940
Well,last time you bought a new
shirt was when we were dating.

238
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,160
So what we did was in fact dating?

239
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,920
Well,yeah,we did have a date.

240
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,420
Exactly. Thank you.

241
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,210
Do me a favor. Tell Koothrappali
that next time you see him.

242
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,240
So,who is she?

243
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,060
Oh,she's a doctor.

244
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,390
Oh,nice.

245
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,130
A doctor doctor, or
a you kind of doctor?

246
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,900
Doctor doctor. Surgical
resident. Smart,pretty.

247
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,700
Let me ask you something.

248
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,830
If your friend thinks he's dating
someone, but he's not because,in fact,

249
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,960
you're dating her, does
that make you a bad person?

250
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,100
- Well,that depends.
- On what?

251
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,240
Is that friend Wolowitz?

252
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,070
- Yeah.
- Screw him. You're fine.

253
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,240
Are you sure?

254
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,810
Well,have you slept with her yet?

255
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,600
You dog!

256
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,470
Good for you.

257
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,560
- Does that change things?
- No.

258
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,230
So why'd you ask?

259
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,330
I'm nosy. See ya.

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,090
Howard,get the door!

261
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,590
Really? Is that what
you dohen someone knocks?

262
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,150
Thank you. I had no idea!

263
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,060
Hey,buddy. What brings you
to my little slice of hell?

264
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,820
Who is it?

265
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,170
It's Leonard!

266
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,890
You're gonna have to play outside!

267
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm not dressed to receive!

268
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,870
No one cares,Ma! So,what's up?

269
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,570
Listen,I need to talk
to you about something.

270
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,100
Momentito. Yello.

271
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,090
Oh,Stephanie, thanks for
calling me back. I was worried...

272
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,690
No,I understand. Sure,we
can be friends. Absolutely.

273
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,540
Thanks for calling.

274
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,150
Yeah,you have a nice day,too.

275
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,860
You are dead to me.

276
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,290
Okay,who gets the extra dumpling?

277
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,710
Rock-paper-scissors-
lizard-Spock.

278
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,040
Okay,one of us is going to
have to stop putting up Spock.

279
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,180
*******

280
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,930
Rock-paper-scissors-
lizard-Spock.

281
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,020
- Oh,hey,guys.
- Hello.

282
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,510
Hi,Howard.

283
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,460
- Howard?
- Sheldon.

284
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,530
Howard is employing a schoolyard
paradigm in which you are,

285
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,230
for all intents and purposes,deceased.

286
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,100
He intends to act on this
by not speaking to you,

287
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,660
feigning an inability to
hear you when you speak

288
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,340
and otherwise refusing to
acknowledge your existence.

289
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,450
That's just ridiculous.

290
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,180
Why are you cooperating with him?

291
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,520
I don't make the rules, Leonard.

292
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,110
Howard,come on. I didn't plan on
this. These things just happen.

293
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,150
Usually not to me, but they do happen.

294
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,660
Did someone just feel a cold breeze?

295
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,940
I believe this is an extension
of the death metaphor.

296
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,970
The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic
issue of a disembodied soul passing by.

297
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,390
You know,screw it. I'm
just gonna eat the dumpling.

298
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,510
Oh,hi,Steph. Come on in.

299
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,660
Is this a bad time?

300
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,620
Yeah,but I don't see a better
one on the horizon,so...

301
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,700
Oh,if it isn't Mrs. Dead to Me.

302
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,810
- Hello,Howard.
- Sheldon?

303
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,050
I'm sorry,you violated the terms of your
metaphor by acknowledging her existence.

304
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,830
I'm out.

305
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,050
He just won't listen to me.

306
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,610
Okay,I guess it'll just
be the three of us then.

307
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,960
- Lisa's gonna be disappointed.
- Yeah.

308
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,980
Lisa?

309
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,420
Yeah,my roommate. She just went
through a really bad breakup

310
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,420
and I thought she might like
to meet somebody fun like you.

311
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,910
Leonard,Stephanie, you're
alive! It's a miracle!

312
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,350
So,anyway,Lisa, I just wanted to tell you
again how much I enjoyed the other night,

313
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,000
and again, I'm sorry for how it ended.

314
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,630
But again,if you could
let me know about Friday.

315
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,880
My mother needs a head count so she
can know how big a brisket to get.

316
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,670
Howard,Howard, look at this.

317
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,530
- Anyway,call me.It's Howard.
- The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike.

318
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,340
It's unclear how the Mars Rover got into
the crevice, but one thing's certain:

319
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,180
The data which it has sent back
contain the first clear indications

320
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,020
that there may have been life on Mars.

321
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,490
It's a scientific discovery that has
staggering implications for all mankind.

322
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,600
Unfortunately,we'll never
know who's responsible.

323
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,810
Son of a bitch.
