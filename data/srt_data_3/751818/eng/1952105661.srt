1
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,070
- You've read it?
- I've read it.

2
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,516
- Have you read this?
- He's read it.

3
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,874
- Let me read it to you!
- We've read it.

4
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,475
"Let's get rid fo Jim Hacker",
by John Pilgrim.

5
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,754
The Right Honourable
Jim Jacker, promised

6
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:05,150
to slim down the Civil Service,
and to wipe out the interference

7
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,674
from the Whitehall
and Town Hall busybodies.

8
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,870
But howmany people realise that

9
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:13,588
more people serve in the Inland
Revenue than the Royal Navy?

10
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,836
- Is it true?
- I believe it is, Minister.

11
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:20,072
- "Perhaps a tax is the best defence".
- Oh, that's ratherwitty.

12
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:24,792
- And have you read this bit?
- I have read it.

13
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,029
"No less than fourministries

14
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,667
check the supply
of the same army uniforms.

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,353
Defence checks to see
they get what they ordered.

16
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,148
Industry checks to see they are
manufactured as perregulations.

17
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,037
The Treasury checks the bills.

18
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:41,032
And Jim Hacker's mob
checks up on everyone else.

19
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:44,794
Jim Hacker is the most obvious case
of overmanning in Whitehall.

20
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,076
Let's get rid ofhim
and save at least one salary".

21
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,276
Frank, why did you read me that?
I told you I'd read it.

22
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,755
Because I'm yourpolitical advisor.

23
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:59,114
This is politically damaging foryou.

24
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,997
Good morning, Minister.

25
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:04,432
- Have you read this?
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

26
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,395
I have read it!
You have read it, he has read it!

27
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:11,596
We have all bloody read it,
do I make myself clear?

28
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,557
Abundantly, Minister.

29
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,518
I'm sorry. Sit down.

30
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,670
Humphrey, we have got
to slim down the Civil Service.

31
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,509
Howmany people have we got
in this department?

32
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,318
This department?
Oh, we're very small.

33
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,958
Small? How small?

34
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,667
I don't know...

35
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,352
2.000?

36
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,467
3.000?

37
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,757
Um... about 23.000,
I think, Minister.

38
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,069
23.000?

39
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,350
In Administrative Affairs?

40
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,829
23.000 people just administering
otheradministrators?

41
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,878
We'll have to do a study
to see who we can get rid of.

42
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,394
- We did one of those last year.
- And?

43
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:53,629
It transpired we needed
another500 people.

44
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,947
However, we could always close
your Bureaucratic Watchdog Office.

45
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:03,316
No. It's the one thing I've done
since I got here.

46
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,074
But it has been criticised
as a trouble maker's letterbox.

47
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,117
I know.
It's very popularwith the voters.

48
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:14,028
They help us find ways
to stop wasting government money.

49
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,509
We are the experts about
wasting government money...

50
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,636
That's not what I meant.

51
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,472
Well, the Bureaucratic
Watchdog Office stays.

52
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,358
Well, offhand I can't think
of what else to suggest.

53
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,875
Are you seriously telling me
there is no way we can cut down?

54
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,709
I suppose we could lose
one ortwo of the tea ladies.

55
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,474
Oh, Humphrey, I do wish
you'd take this seriously.

56
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,630
Tea ladies!
I want the facts.

57
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,267
I want to knowwho works here,
what they do,

58
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,476
what buildings we have,
what goes on in them.

59
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,674
Then we'll knowwhere to cut costs,
cut staff, cut procedures...

60
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,638
The Civil Service, Minister,
exists to implement

61
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,710
legislation enacted
by Parliament.

62
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,428
As long as Parliament continues
to legislate, the Civil Service...

63
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,114
However, I am fully seized
of yourrequirements,

64
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:05,634
and I'll go and set
the wheels in motion.

65
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,028
Thank you.

66
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,508
- Good morning, Mr. Weasel.
- Weisel.

67
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,834
Did you know that
a Regional Controller

68
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:19,196
has achieved cuts of 32 million
in his region alone?

69
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,232
And that the Civil Service
is suppressing the story?

70
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,276
- Is it true?
- If it is, I'm aghast!

71
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,351
- Why?
- Lfhe can save, everyone else can.

72
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:34,831
Why don't you look into it,
have a bit of a ferret around?

73
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,912
Do you think I could?

74
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,593
I think that's a very good idea,
Mr. Ferret erWeasel.

75
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,757
- He told you 32 million pounds?
- Yes, Sir Humphrey.

76
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,147
- I'm aghast!
- So I was.

77
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,310
It's incredible
we didn't know about it.

78
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,947
- I knew about it.
- Then why are you aghast?

79
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,677
I'm aghast that it got out.

80
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,147
We'll get less money
from the Treasury next year.

81
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,469
Oh, it's afterhalf past five.
Sherry?

82
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,231
Oh, er, yes. Thank you.

83
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,159
- You still look worried, Bernard.
- Well... yes.

84
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,787
I mean, surely we want
to save money.

85
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,110
You knowperfectly well
there has to be some way

86
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,191
to measure success
in the Civil Service.

87
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:18,510
British Leyland
measure theirsuccess

88
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,432
by the size of theirprofits,
or, to be more accurate,

89
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:24,397
they measure theirfailure
by the size of their losses.

90
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,876
We don't have profits and losses.

91
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,631
We have to measure oursuccess

92
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,313
by the size of ourstaff
and ourbudget.

93
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:33,390
By definition, Bernard,

94
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,789
a big department
is more successful.

95
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,712
Are you saying that
the Regional Controller

96
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,995
boobed by saving
so much money?

97
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,798
Well, of course.
Nobody asked him to.

98
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,311
Suppose everybody did it!

99
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,470
Suppose everyone
went around saving money

100
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,675
irresponsibly all overthe place.

101
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,354
That's what the Ministerwants,
isn't it?

102
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,032
Do sit down, Bernard.

103
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,153
Ministers come and Ministers go.

104
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:04,472
The average Minister lasts less
than 11 months in any department.

105
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,956
You see, Bernard, it is ourduty
to assist the Minister

106
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,873
to fight forthe Department's money
despite his own panic reactions.

107
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,677
You mean help him
overcome his panic.

108
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,115
No. No. No.
No, we must let him panic.

109
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,197
Politicians like to panic.
They need activity.

110
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,507
It's theirsubstitute
forachievement.

111
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,639
We must just ensure
that it doesn't change anything.

112
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,108
But they are the people's
representatives,

113
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,678
democratically chosen.

114
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,468
MP's aren't chosen by the people,
but by their local party.

115
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,473
35 men in grubby raincoats
or35 women in silly hats.

116
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,037
But the government are selected
from the best of them.

117
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,788
Bernard, there are only 630 MP's.

118
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,714
If one partyhas just over300
it forms a government.

119
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:57,116
Of that 300, one hundred
are too old and too silly,

120
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,235
one hundred too young
and too callow

121
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,959
which leaves just about
a hundred MP's to fill

122
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,916
one hundred gobernmental posts.

123
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,751
There's no choice al all.

124
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,479
They've had no selection,
no training.

125
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,107
We have to do the job forthem.

126
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,069
But how can we explain saving
32 million to the Minister?

127
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,791
We can explain they've changed
theiraccounting systems.

128
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,473
Orthat they've redrawn
the regional boundaries

129
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,312
so that the current figures
aren't operable.

130
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:29,789
There are all sorts
of possibilities.

131
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,233
I see.

132
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,597
Useful chat, Bernard,
good job it nevertook place.

133
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,318
Yes. Yes. Of course.

134
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,794
So what else is
ourfriend Weasel up to?

135
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,392
Oh, he's ferretting.

136
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,671
Ferretting? Where?

137
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,871
It's a roving brief.

138
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:54,908
Then we shall have to provide Rover
with a government car.

139
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,753
So thatwe'll know
where he's digging.

140
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:03,871
How... how are you getting on
with your Minister, Humpy?

141
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,828
Got this economising
nosense undercontrol?

142
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,229
Yes, I think so, Jumbo...
more o less.

143
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,119
- What do you mean more or less?
- Well... yes and no.

144
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:16,509
Presumably it's like all the other
government economy drives?

145
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:19,267
Three days of press releases,
three weeks of memos,

146
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,828
a crisis in the Middle East
and back to normal?

147
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,910
This one's slightly different.

148
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:27,236
He's beginning to see
slimming down the Service

149
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,673
as his main task.

150
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,399
Dammit, we don't need slimming!

151
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:38,716
I think you might have to conduct
anotherOperation HairShirt.

152
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,354
Operation HairShirt.
What a good idea.

153
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,030
Guide him towards painful
personal economies.

154
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,394
Yes, you know.

155
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,267
"Economy begins at home, Minister".

156
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,236
"Set an example, Minister".

157
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,550
"Can't expect others to do what
we can't do ourselves, Minister".

158
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:01,435
Yes, yes. Just what he needs,
self denial.

159
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,072
Splendid.

160
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,751
Right. Item 3. The economy drive.

161
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,157
Frank has come up
with some startling indications

162
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,230
of wastage in ourvery midst.

163
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,709
- Has he really?
- You'll be surprised.

164
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,347
These facts are
a frightening indictment

165
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,828
ofbureaucratic sloppiness
and self indulgence.

166
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:25,234
Dear, dear.

167
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,232
But as you'll see,
they do give us enormous scope

168
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,549
forsome really dramatic economies.

169
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,268
Good show!

170
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,398
Now, I have here two files:
One on manpower, one on buildings.

171
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,153
Let's startwith the buildings.

172
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,994
Chadwick House,
West Audley Street.

173
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,435
- A handful of people working there.
- Yes, 20...

174
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,829
I do happen to know
about Chadwick House.

175
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,229
- What do you know?
- It's underused,

176
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,869
but it is the office forthe new
Commission forthe Environment.

177
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,793
We're wondering if it's going
to be big enough forall the staff.

178
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,552
O. K. What about Ladysmith
Buildings, Walthamstow.

179
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,153
- Apparently that's empty.
- Of course.

180
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,877
- What do you mean, of course?
- Security, I can say no more.

181
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,355
Do you mean Ml6?

182
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,836
What's that supposed to mean?

183
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,115
We do not admit that Ml6 exists.

184
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,510
- Everybody knows it exists.
- Nevertheless, we do not admit it.

185
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:31,591
Not everyone round this table
has been vetted.

186
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,467
I thought thatwas something
you do cats.

187
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:40,072
Yes, indeed.
But not ferrets, Minister.

188
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,599
Ladysmith House is top secret.

189
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,468
How can a seven storey building
in Walthamstowbe top secret?

190
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,909
Where there's a will
there's a way.

191
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,188
What about Wellington House
and WestminsterOld Hall?

192
00:10:56,359 --> 00:11:00,398
Wellington House, Hyde Park Road,
estimated value 7.5 million pounds.

193
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,356
WestminsterOld Hall,
Sackville Square,

194
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,510
estimated value
11 million pounds.

195
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,352
Each building with a tiny staff,
and both filled

196
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,430
entirely with filing cabinets.

197
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,348
- The source of these valuations?
- Going rate forproperty.

198
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,352
But neitherof them would fetch
the going rate.

199
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,511
Wellington House has
no fire escape orfire doors

200
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,034
and the building
wouldn't stand the alteration.

201
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,111
- It can't be used as offices.
- How are you able to use them?

202
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,795
Government buildings do not
require fire safety clearance.

203
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,959
Why not?

204
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:35,239
Well, perhaps because Her Majesty's
Civil Servants are not easily inflamed.

205
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,916
What about WestminsterOld Hall?

206
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,388
Class one Registered Building.

207
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,914
Can't change current
userdesignation.

208
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,034
I see. 3 to 17 Beaconsfield Street?

209
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:56,034
Ah, yes. Now, that has a three level
reinforced concrete basement.

210
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,588
So?

211
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,317
It is there in case.

212
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:01,439
In case?

213
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,237
Well, you know, Minister.

214
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,594
Emergency Government
Headquarters, if and when.

215
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,272
If and when what?

216
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,839
If and when... you knowwhat.

217
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,469
- What?
- If and when you knowwhat.

218
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,197
I don't knowwhat. What?

219
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,512
What do you mean,
if and when you knowwhat?

220
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,192
When the chips are down,

221
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:24,032
the balloon goes up
and the lights go out...

222
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,152
There has to be somewhere
to carry on government,

223
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,469
even if everything else stops.

224
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,073
Why?

225
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,396
Government doesn't stop just because
the whole country's been destroyed.

226
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,151
Annihilation's bad enough,

227
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,549
without anarchy
to make things even worse.

228
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,427
You mean you'd have
a lot of rebellions cinders?

229
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,068
Who would be there
foryou to govern?

230
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,436
Well, there're bound to be
some ordinary people around.

231
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:59,110
- What about Central Registry?
- No planning permission.

232
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,271
How does he know all this?
You knewwhere I'd been.

233
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,395
Obviously we knew
where he'd been.

234
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,231
Was he supposed to be spying?

235
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,108
We do believe in open enquiries,
don'twe?

236
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:13,547
Let us turn to manpower.

237
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,033
Yes, let's!

238
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,512
Aparently there are
90 Civil Servants in Sunderland

239
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,512
duplicating the work
of 90 more here in Whitehall.

240
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,068
That stems
from a Cabinet decision.

241
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,117
- Job creation in the North East.
- Let's get rid of them.

242
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,429
We'd get rid of 90 Civil Servants
at a stroke.

243
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,908
Yes, or indeed, at a strike.

244
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,307
Yes. ¿What?

245
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,313
I would be wholeheartedly
in favourof such a move.

246
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,276
Itwould be a splendid economy.

247
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,431
And show great political courage
to sack staff

248
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:45,716
in depressed
marginal constituencies.

249
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,113
There is nowhere
we can cut down.

250
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,032
- I see waste everywhere.
- I agree with you, Minister.

251
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,759
- There is scope foreconomy...
- Well, where?

252
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:00,469
Well. I sometimes feel
that the very way we do things

253
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,995
is on too lavish a scale.
You know, cars, furnishings...

254
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,468
entertainments,
private office staff...

255
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,358
- Duplicating machines...
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Fine. Yes.

256
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,430
That's where we'll start.

257
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,432
- Unfortunately there is a difficulty.
- I knew it!

258
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,430
It does cause
profound resentment

259
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:19,557
if those at the top continue
to enjoy the comforts

260
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,675
they withdraw
from those below them,

261
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,478
not to mention
the deeply damaging publicity...

262
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,876
You mean you and I should...

263
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,797
Set a personal example?

264
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,711
Economy begins at home?

265
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,315
We can't expect others to do
whatwe don't do ourselves, can we?

266
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,557
- Would it really save all that much?
- Well, not directly, no.

267
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:44,634
But, as an example to the whole
public service... incalculable.

268
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,198
Well, I don't know...

269
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,635
Jim, there'd be
a lot of great publicity in it:

270
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,749
"The Ministershows the way".

271
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,797
"Slimline Government".

272
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,269
"Hackersets an example".
"Save it" says Jim.

273
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,997
Yes. Yes, that's it.

274
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,991
Great, where do we start?

275
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,352
- Oh! Turn the...
- Sorry. Were you asleep?

276
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,519
Yes.

277
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,518
I missed my train.

278
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,710
Had to walk all the way to Euston.

279
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,393
- And the chauffeurdriven car?
- Got rid of it.

280
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,029
Got rid of the chauffeurtoo,
and all that office furniture,

281
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,032
drinks cabinet, half the staff
in my private office.

282
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:32,349
- You've been sacked.
- No, no...

283
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,794
- Then why?
- It's an economy drive.

284
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:39,952
I'm setting an example.
No luxuries, no frills, no privileges...

285
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:41,638
You're mad...

286
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,588
For 20 years you've complained
you had no facilities.

287
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,273
- Now you're throwing them away.
- But, darling...

288
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:50,907
20 years you've wanted
to be a success.

289
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,071
Why, if it brings no greater
comfort than failure?

290
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,150
You don't really understand
politics.

291
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:59,709
This way it's going to bring me
much more power in the end.

292
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,554
And how are you going to travel
when you are Prime Minister.

293
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:04,993
Hitch hike?

294
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,794
- Bernard, ourdiary session.
- As soon as I've done this typing.

295
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,992
- Can't you get...?
- Not really, it's ratherurgent.

296
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,276
And since the cutbacks
there's just the two of us.

297
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,157
Well, I must talk to you.

298
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,391
- Mandy! Mandy!
- Yes?

299
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,628
Where's W?

300
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,713
Top left.

301
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,197
Bernard! Come in here!

302
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,878
Now!

303
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,997
I was double booked this morning.
I was late forthat thing.

304
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,593
- What thing?
- The Business Efficiency Exhibition!

305
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,958
I do apologise,
but whatwith the...

306
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:51,428
staff economies
in yourprivate office,

307
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:54,238
it is awfully difficult
to keep track.

308
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,596
- What's happening this afternoon?
- I'll get the diary.

309
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,033
Not now, dear!

310
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,387
Not now!

311
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,156
- Morning, duck.
- Do you have to do that now?

312
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,550
Yes. Yes. They've cancelled
the night shift.

313
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:20,268
Some idiot's started another
of those economy drives.

314
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:24,154
- I'm Nellie.
- Good. Well, the point is...

315
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,547
Who are you?

316
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,598
I'm the Minister.

317
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,799
Oh, really?

318
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:36,629
Oh, I'm everso pleased to meet you.
I voted foryou.

319
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,755
Oh, good. Thank you.

320
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,837
You can call me Nellie.

321
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:41,999
Thank you.

322
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:44,992
- What do I call you?
- Er... Jim.

323
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,036
Here's the diary, Minister.

324
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,838
Right.
Turn that off, would you, dear?

325
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:51,910
Turn it... Nellie!

326
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:53,988
What?

327
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:56,309
Would you excuse us?
This is confidential.

328
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,152
I've got to get on you know, Jim.

329
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:00,868
So have I.

330
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:03,199
Jim?

331
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,910
Well, I won't use the hoover.

332
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,673
I'll tiptoe, you'll nevernotice me.

333
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,034
- Go please.
- I'm light as a feather.

334
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,951
Go! Now!

335
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,118
All right, Jim.

336
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,997
I can take a hint.

337
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:31,193
It's just Mr. Brough this morning,
our Directorof Manpower Planning.

338
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:34,033
- Brough?
- Yes, staff reductions.

339
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,908
- Oh, yes.
- And then straight to the House.

340
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,958
At 8 o'clock the French Prime
Minister's reception at his Embassy.

341
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,509
I must take the schedules down
to the Whips Office.

342
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,156
- Bernard...
- Yes, Minister?

343
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,877
It is worth it, you know...

344
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,428
Centre page spread
and three pictures.

345
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,271
Yes, I have read it, Minister.

346
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,388
See this one of me, with a cheese roll
on a cardboard plate?

347
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:05,552
"No luxury lunches in Hacker's
new austerity regime".

348
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:08,597
"Economy begins at home"
said Jim Hackertoday,

349
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,068
as he set an example
to Britain's pampered army

350
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,991
ofbowlerhatted bureaucrats".

351
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,477
- Terrific, isn't it?
- You have read it to me already.

352
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,433
- Great, isn't it?
- Yes, Minister.

353
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:24,153
Economise on the beaches...

354
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,557
- Excuse me.
- Yes? Yes?

355
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:30,438
- I'd like to see the Minister.
- Do you have an appointment?

356
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,555
Ron Watson, General Secretary

357
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:36,029
of the Union of Civil Service
Transport Workers.

358
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:38,588
- Yes, Mr. Watson.
- We're disturbed about rumours

359
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,319
of redundancies
affecting ourmembers...

360
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,993
I'm sorry, you must have
an appointment.

361
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,878
- Phone me tomorrow.
- Why can't I arrange it now?

362
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,472
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, really!

363
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:52,109
Mandy, make an appointment
for Mr. Watson fornextweek.

364
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,279
Nextweek?

365
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,350
Hello... Mr. Brough.

366
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,555
Yes, we're expecting
Mr. Brough now.

367
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,869
When's it due in at Euston?

368
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,312
We'll just have to cancel it
fortoday then.

369
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,152
Yes, yes, I'll tell him.
Goodbye.

370
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,832
Sorry to keep you.

371
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,310
Now, about yourappointment.
When would be convenient...

372
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,947
- The meeting's cancelled then?
- Yes.

373
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,236
- So I can see him now?
- I'm afraid not, you see...

374
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:20,355
Would you excuse me
just a moment?

375
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,468
Yes?
No. He's not here.

376
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:28,511
He's gone overto the Whips Office.
Would you like the extension?

377
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,668
Ah, Mr...

378
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,439
Brough?

379
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,874
Mr. Brough's
had to cancel the meeting.

380
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,711
My name's Ron Watson. I'm...

381
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:40,915
I'm glad
you could get here instead.

382
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:43,309
- Do sit down, won't you.
- Oh, thank you.

383
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,878
Now, Mr. Er...

384
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,267
Watson.

385
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:50,552
Before we start there's one thing
I must make absolutely clear.

386
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,550
This must not get out.

387
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,633
If the unions
were to get to hearof this

388
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,834
all hell would be let loose.

389
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,513
Oh, yes.

390
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,355
Of course there'll be redundancies.
You simply...

391
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,953
You simply can't slim down

392
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,429
a giant bureaucracy like this
without getting rid of people.

393
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,516
Ultimately, a lot of people.

394
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:15,716
Won't you be holding discussions
with the Unions first?

395
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,835
We'll go through
the charade of discussions,

396
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:20,069
but you know
what Trade Unionists are like;

397
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,548
thick as two short planks
and bloody minded.

398
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,554
All of them?

399
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,279
Pretty well.
Good lord, you should know.

400
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:31,112
They're interested in poaching
each other's members

401
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,668
and they can't keep
theirbig mouths shut.

402
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:38,188
What about drivers
and transport service staff?

403
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,394
First to go.

404
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,027
We waste a fortuna
on cars and drivers.

405
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:45,316
- And they're all on the fiddle.
- Oh, I see.

406
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,630
Because, as I was trying to explain,
I'm not Mr. Brough's deputy.

407
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,311
I'm the General Secretary of the Union
of Civil Service Transport

408
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,788
and Associated Government Workers.

409
00:21:58,919 --> 00:21:59,919
Ah. I...

410
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,718
I came here to check there was
no truth in the rumours

411
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,949
of redundancies formy members.

412
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,271
Well... I... I...

413
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,918
All I meantwas...

414
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,148
Oh, God.

415
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,034
He quotes me, word forword:

416
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:34,152
"Of course there will be
redundancies. Lots!"

417
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,351
I'm most terribly sorry.

418
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,079
- Are all the drivers on strike?
- 100 % response.

419
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,434
How could you allow this
to happen?

420
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,918
C. B. E., Minister.

421
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,988
C. B. E?

422
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,638
Can't be everywhere.

423
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,314
Of course,
in normal circumstances...

424
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,515
Yes. Yes. I know, I know.

425
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,316
You and Mrs. Hackerare due
at the French Embassy at 8.

426
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,878
Oh, yes.
Get me the car, will you?

427
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:07,473
Oh... Betterring Mrs. Hacker,
ask herto bring ourcar into town.

428
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:11,712
Mrs. Hackersays she has
to drop it off at the garage.

429
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,835
She'll have to do that tomorrow.

430
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,474
It'll get us as faras Kensington.

431
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,035
At least there are
no problems about that.

432
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:33,279
Annie, it's no good.
We'll have to walk.

433
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,794
- Have you got the umbrella?
- No, haven't you?

434
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,072
Terrific.

435
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,073
- You're going the wrong way.
- I'm not, I'm going home.

436
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,075
Annie! I think I've found
what's wrong.

437
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,513
I know I have!

438
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:13,879
Oui, Monsieur?

439
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,997
Her Majesty's Minister
forAdministrative Affairs.

440
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,912
My carbroke down.

441
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:27,629
Mr. Hacker, you look
as if you need some champagne.

442
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,511
I do. Lots!

443
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,714
Mr. Hacker?

444
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:38,759
Hello.

445
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,712
Thanks, mate.

446
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,118
Gutterpress!

447
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,229
All right, what do they say?

448
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,148
"Mr. Economyfalls down in gutter
afterchampagne party".

449
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,514
- Oh, my God!
- This one is better.

450
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,147
"Hackertired and emotional
after Embassy reception".

451
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,833
- Is that better?
- It's different.

452
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,709
Do any of them say anything other
than "tired and emotional"?

453
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:14,439
William Hickey said you were
overwrought, Minister.

454
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,909
- Nothing about being drunk?
- Just "overwrought".

455
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,349
"Overwrought as a newt",
actually.

456
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,990
It couldn't really be any worse.

457
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,077
I don'twant to depress you...

458
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:29,192
but there is just this lead story
in The Times.

459
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:31,593
It is worse!

460
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,877
"Hackerrecruit 400 new Civil Servants
in, quote, "economy drive"!

461
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,758
- 400 more Civil Servants?
- You asked forthem.

462
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:41,513
You demanded a complete study,
facts and figures.

463
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,068
These measures cannot be taken
with non people.

464
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:47,914
If you create more jobs,
more people have to be employed.

465
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,353
It's common sense.

466
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,511
If you persistwith the
Bureaucratic Watchdog Office,

467
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,671
there'll be another400 new jobs
there as well.

468
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,994
- What are we going to do?
- Well, Minister...

469
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,070
If we were to end
the economy drive

470
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,355
and close the Bureaucratic
Watchdog Office,

471
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,669
we could issue
a press announcement

472
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,318
that you'd axed 800 jobs.

473
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:14,313
Now, if you'd care to glance
at this draft proposal...

474
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,993
But nobody's doing those jobs.

475
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,391
An even greatereconomy, we've
saved 800 redundancy payments.

476
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,154
But that's phoney, it's cheating
it's dishonest, it's just...

477
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,198
pulling the wool
overpeople's eyes.

478
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:31,554
A Government Press release,
in fact.

479
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,877
But what are we actually going
to do slim down the Civil Service?

480
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:40,317
Perhaps you'd care to glance
at this entirely fresh proposal.

481
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,912
"Proposal for the Reduction
of the Number of

482
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:47,872
Tea Ladies".
