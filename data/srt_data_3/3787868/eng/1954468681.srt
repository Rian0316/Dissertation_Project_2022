00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,549
I'm helping him find his way,

186
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,253
but not to worry.

187
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,490
I'll return him to you.

188
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:53,261
All I ask is that you hear me out.

189
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:56,301
You expect me to sit through
a sermon of your lies?

190
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:59,840
I have lied in the past, to my shame,

191
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:03,176
but I'm going to tell you the truth.

192
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:05,246
I'm in the process of making Elijah

193
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:08,549
into the man he was meant to be,

194
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:13,019
and I intend to do the same for you.

195
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:24,252
Lenore: This plantation, ruined by fire.

196
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:29,325
How sad, not to mention symbolic.

197
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,722
After all, you never intended

198
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:34,357
to build a true home here.

199
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:37,026
Even as Hayley carried your child,

200
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,895
as Rebekah and Elijah sought to defend you,

201
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:41,498
your thoughts were focused only

202
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,335
on your conquest of the quarter.

203
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:45,805
Tell me, how did that go?

204
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:49,077
I'm sorry. Is this some
sort of motherly critique?

205
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,877
Please feel free to choke on it.

206
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,379
I mention your failures

207
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:56,748
only to make a point, my dear.

208
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,284
You've endured several lifetimes of misery,

209
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,389
never mind the suffering
you've caused others,

210
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,225
even to your own blood.

211
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,860
You yourself remain trapped

212
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:08,193
in a perpetual state of despair.

213
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:10,528
I have come to offer you

214
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,865
a means to escape that cycle.

215
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:15,603
And that's about all
the hypocrisy I can take.

216
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:18,510
I suggest you give me my brother

217
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,779
before I get angry.

218
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,484
Such hatred.

219
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:26,457
It breaks my heart to see you like this,

220
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:27,892
the boy I loved.

221
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:31,994
Your love was a curse,
an affect you feigned.

222
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:34,464
The truth is, you're no better than Mikael,

223
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,533
and like him, you seem to have crawled back

224
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:41,503
from the grave simply
to ruin your own children.

225
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:44,973
Oh.

226
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:48,141
You didn't know. Yes.

227
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:50,574
The destroyer has risen, brought back

228
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,077
to kill me by the witch Davina.

229
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,346
Surely Kol has revealed everything to you,

230
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,814
or has mother's loyal, little boot licker

231
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:00,782
not quite so loyal, after all?

232
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:26,106
Marcel: I bet you want a new
advisor right about now.

233
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:28,343
Who is he, Marcel? I mean, really.

234
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:31,216
Long story short is... Impossible.

235
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,685
I checked the school's website.

236
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:35,089
Vincent Griffith has no
other academic credentials,

237
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:36,524
and, according to my uncle Kieran's

238
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,390
big book of New Orleans bloodlines,

239
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:40,628
Griffith is a family of witches.

240
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,063
Oh, it's worse that that.

241
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,531
Your therapist has a 1,000-year-old,

242
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,033
dead vampire inside of him

243
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:47,736
named Finn Mikaelson.

244
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:52,906
My advisor is Klaus' brother?

245
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:56,180
Oh, God, Marcel, he came
into Rousseau's today

246
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:59,182
asking questions about Klaus
and ordered my favorite drink

247
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:01,049
like he's been watching me.

248
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,418
Why?

249
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,222
Probably to get the scoop on Klaus,

250
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:05,958
maybe to use you as bait for a trap.

251
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,126
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

252
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:08,528
Either way, you're done with that guy.

253
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,199
No. I'm just getting started.

254
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,069
If Mikael has returned,

255
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:14,839
we will need to deal with him.

256
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:18,445
Ho ho! We? Is that a joke?

257
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,780
Am I to forego centuries of hatred

258
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:23,284
for my evil mother in order to join her

259
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:25,388
in besting the very demon

260
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,424
she herself allowed to raise me?

261
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:29,059
I am not evil, Niklaus.

262
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:32,764
I am your salvation, and Mikael,

263
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,804
he was not always a demon.

264
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:40,645
Lenore: Long ago, he loved
his children with all his heart.

265
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:43,050
He doted on your brother Finn,

266
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:48,294
but it was our first-born Freya
who was the apple of his eye.

267
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,764
Do you really think that
saccharine recollections

268
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:57,170
of ancient history will
have any effect on me at all?

269
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:59,440
What I think is that you have gone mad

270
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:02,010
from centuries of hating your parents,

271
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:05,849
but if you join me now,

272
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:09,687
I can grant you peace...

273
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:16,797
And should Mikael return
with the intent to harm you,

274
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,135
I will strike him down myself.

275
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:29,678
That's quite an offer,

276
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,380
but, you know,

277
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:34,715
I've never needed any help

278
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:37,417
when it comes to killing parents.

279
00:14:39,123 --> 00:14:42,490
You reject me out of hatred,

280
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:46,557
but I have something stronger.

281
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,498
I have the truth about your father...

282
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,435
Not Mikael, your real father.

283
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,289
[Arrows release]

284
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,792
Hayley: Is that your best shot?

285
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,361
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that

286
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:30,299
if you're gonna kill a hybrid.

287
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:34,036
Jackson: Stop.

288
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:38,303
Jackson.

289
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,772
Hayley.

290
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,543
I see you met my friend Ansel.

291
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,380
You know her?

292
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,251
Yeah. Actually, I do.

293
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:51,789
She was supposed to be my wife.

294
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,187
Lenore: 1,000 years ago in a fit of rage,

295
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,956
you wrapped your bare hands around my neck

296
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,160
and squeezed until I died.

297
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:12,499
Do you even remember why?

298
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,635
Let's see.

299
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:16,470
You turned us all into monsters.

300
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:19,140
You cursed me, denied me
of my hybrid nature.

301
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:20,810
You lied about my father.

302
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,379
It's that one above all.

303
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,486
You killed me because I kept you

304
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:26,621
from ever knowing your true father.

305
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,322
My hatred for you runs so deep,

306
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:31,124
it's difficult to pinpoint its origin.

307
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:37,295
Maybe I hate that I'm the
product of a whore's lechery.

308
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,829
Watch your mouth.

309
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,997
You would do well to remember

310
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:44,198
that you are still my son.

311
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,872
You judge me evil, yet it was your lust

312
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,076
that made me what I am.

313
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,781
Not once have I ever regretted

314
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:53,420
the love I had for your father,

315
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:55,417
and you have never known the truth

316
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,785
of how that love came to be

317
00:16:57,787 --> 00:16:59,419
or what happened in the months

318
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:02,187
after Mikael and I lost your sister Freya

319
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,489
to the plague.

320
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,189
There are no words for the loss of a child,

321
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:10,894
as you well know.

322
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,433
After Francesca Guerrera
took over the wolves,

323
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:15,569
she offered me a moonlight ring

324
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,972
as long as I'd call her Alpha.

325
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:19,574
I declined.

326
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:20,775
So a couple of her brothers dragged me

327
00:17:20,777 --> 00:17:22,744
out here and left me for dead.

328
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:24,349
By the time I healed up,

329
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:26,654
work had spread about what happened to you

330
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:29,257
and to your baby.

331
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:33,997
So I knew it was over,

332
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:37,737
and I just drifted,

333
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:40,370
and that's when I met Ansel.

334
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:42,706
See, he's been teaching me the old ways,

335
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,643
the traditions,

336
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:46,547
what it means to be a wolf.

337
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:50,217
You mean, by living out
in the ass end of nowhere?

338
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:51,785
Hey, easy.

339
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,419
Your kind makes him ornery.

340
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:54,822
My kind?

341
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,658
Jack, whatever you and
your friend think of me,

342
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,629
my kind is the wolves.

343
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,564
Even if they did pledge
allegiance to a witch,

344
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:03,333
all that means is, they need an Alpha.

345
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:09,880
All I need is one, too.

346
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:12,849
Yeah. I heard about that.

347
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:15,854
Thing is, Ollie betrayed me.

348
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:17,523
He plotted with the Guerrera's.

349
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:18,859
He spilled his own people's blood.

350
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:20,429
He was trying to make up for that.

351
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,603
It doesn't matter. Witches have him.

352
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:28,437
He's dead, not that I care.

353
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,777
You don't want to be the Alpha, fine.

354
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,213
I'll save Ollie myself.

355
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,380
You got a problem, old man?

356
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,448
I have no love of vampires,

357
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,750
but I will not allow a wolf

358
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,053
to be killed by witches.

359
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,923
At least someone is interested.

360
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,962
After Freya died, Mikael was inconsolable.

361
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:56,928
Compelled by his grief, we were forced

362
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,700
to pack our things and set across the seas.

363
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:04,975
Eventually, his despair
would drive us apart,

364
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,480
and that's when I saw
him for the first time...

365
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,116
Your father.

366
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:13,287
I'd never seen a man like him,

367
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:17,922
powerful yet wise but loved by his people,

368
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,558
and... Because Mikael had chosen

369
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,493
to leave me alone in his grief,

370
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,828
shunning me from his life...

371
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,429
I found myself drawn to another.

372
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:30,331
Spare me the sordid details

373
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,999
of my origin.

374
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,634
I only speak the truth.

375
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:36,135
Then tell me this, mother.

376
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:38,671
Why did your adonis abandon his son?

377
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:40,172
Why did he allow me to be raised

378
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:42,507
by a monster who hated me?

379
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:44,343
Why not claim me for himself,

raise me among the wolves,

381
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,384
or was he as ashamed of his bastard

382
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:50,452
as you were?

383
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:52,152
No, no, no. He loved you.

384
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:54,588
It was I who forbade it.

385
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,227
I knew if Mikael had
learned of my infidelity,

386
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,665
he would've destroyed us in his rage.

387
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,737
I had no choice.

on a witch with a 1,000-
year-old grudge match

390
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,172
against Klaus?

391
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,272
Uh-uh. I'm not gonna let you

392

393

I can handle myself.

394

Look. Ok. I get it.

395
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:15,043
You're mad at the guy,

396
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,444
and you want to get even.

397
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:17,813
It's not about getting even, marcel.

398
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,381
Look around.

399
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:21,481
Everything in this room,
this is my family's legacy,

400
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:23,048
and if I had just embraced it

401
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,548
the first time around, I could've uncovered

402
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,450
Francesca Guerrera's secret, and the wolves

403
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:27,818
would never have taken over the quarter,

404
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,887
and Klaus' baby would still be alive.

405
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:33,690
So don't tell me not to get involved.

Tell me you got your Alpha.

Hayley: He's out of commission,

410
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:43,498
but I got the next best thing.

411
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,332
I'm assuming you have
a plan to keep Finn occupied.

412
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:51,497
Yeah. Yeah. I think I might have an idea.

413
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:58,407
When I learned I was with child,

414
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:00,144
I went back to Mikael.

415
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:02,614
I told him I was having his baby.

416
00:21:02,616 --> 00:21:04,315
He showed no joy,

417
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:07,253
but neither did he suspect the truth.

Lenore: When you were born,
it renewed his spirits.

419
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:15,527
We had Kol, Rebekah, Henrik.

420
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,399
Because of you, we were a family again.

421
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:20,768
Oh...

A family built on secrets and lies.

423
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:29,571
Oh, you were my secret joy,

424
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:32,176
and to protect your secret,

425
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:35,247
I denied you a life with your father,

426
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:37,950
but what if I could make up for all that

427
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:40,052
by curing you of this sickness

428
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:42,052
that's infected your soul?

429
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:44,885
Whereas I put Kol and Finn
into the bodies of a witch,

430
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,789
you I shall place into
the body of a werewolf

431
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,557
so you can live out your days as what

432
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,757
you were always meant to be.

433
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,124
What could possibly make you think

434
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:56,291
I would agree to such a thing?

435
00:21:56,293 --> 00:21:58,727
With mortality, you could start over.

436
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,966
You could have a family of your own,

that yearned for an end
to your vicious ways,

to perpetuate the cycles

00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:19,813
I think you're going to tell me

548
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:21,616
to stop spending time with Klaus.

549
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,351
Cami, you're an intelligent woman.

550
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:25,521
You're articulate, poised.

551
00:28:25,523 --> 00:28:27,957
I think you can tell
for yourself what's best.

552
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:29,858
Oh!

553
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,895
You know, sometimes I ask myself

554
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:37,001
why I let people like Klaus into my life.

555
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:39,639
I have this destructive pattern.

556
00:28:39,641 --> 00:28:43,277
I'm always drawn to the bad boys.

557
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,782
Maybe deep down,

558
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:49,553
I feel like that's what I deserve.

559
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:57,596
Hey, Cami, I'm an expert
in unhealthy patterns.

560
00:28:57,598 --> 00:29:00,633
I've broken some of my own,

561
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:03,102
and I can help you do the same

562
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,272
if you'll let me.

563
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:17,317
Aagh! Aargh!

564
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:22,292
Run. Uh!

565
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,191
Aagh!

566
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:32,034
Agh...

567
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,307
Marcel: Ah...

568
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:48,389
Aiden: Come on out!

569
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:50,256
We know you're here.

570
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:03,838
Why don't you just let us go,

571
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,339
and we can call it a day?

572
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,410
No. I don't think so.

573
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:13,446
Then we do this the hard way.

574
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,282
Oliver: You idiots.

575
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:22,956
You're lining up to fight a hybrid?

576
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:26,792
For what, so you can kill me,

577
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:31,533
all because some witch gave an order?

578
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:36,539
I know I ain't innocent,
but I never lost sight

579
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:39,574
of what I was fighting for.

580
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:43,313
We were gonna be a pack.

581
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:47,546
But now...

582
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:51,618
We are turning on each other,

583
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,620
killing your own people.

584
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:57,289
We do that,

585
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,294
we're nothing.

586
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:43,621
You.

587
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:50,390
- Niklaus...
- No. No.

588
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,092
- You're not real.
- Niklaus...

589
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:55,094
No! You're a phantom conjured by Esther.

590
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:59,531
That is all you are.
Mother, stop this charade.

591
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:02,368
I know that thing is not real.

592
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,773
Look at me, Niklaus.

593
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:10,713
I am flesh and blood...

594
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,113
Your flesh and blood.

595
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:15,749
You've been dead 1,000 years.

596
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:16,951
Through that time,

597
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:18,353
I lingered on the other side

598
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:20,891
watching you let the world fall apart

599
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:23,393
until I woke 4 moons past

600
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:25,159
in a land of wolves like myself.

601
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:30,431
No. No. No. You're just in my head.

602
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:32,535
You're an illusion meant by my mother

603
00:32:32,537 --> 00:32:34,873
to sway me to accept her bargain.

604
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,139
I do not speak for Esther.

605
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:39,974
I know nothing of her bargains...

606
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:49,817
But you are my son.

607
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:08,866
Even if what you say is real...

608
00:33:12,503 --> 00:33:15,006
You are nothing to me.

609
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,847
For all I care, you can crawl back to hell.

610
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:52,683
You sure this is gonna work?

611
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:55,920
Klaus' blood is the only
cure for a wolf bite.

612
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:58,254
Thing is, I'm running low.

613
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:00,922
So new rule... Don't get bit.

614
00:34:00,924 --> 00:34:02,893
I got bit saving your ass.

615
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:04,930
Yeah, and you did good, too.

616
00:34:04,932 --> 00:34:06,834
I got to admit, though, when you took off,

617
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,836
I thought you were gone.

618
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,969
All my life, when things got tough,

619
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:13,438
that's what I would do.

620
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,677
I would run because I never fit in, anyway,

621
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,915
but this place, what you're building here,

622
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:23,185
it fits.

623
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:28,558
So I'm in, no running, no matter what.

624
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,959
And thanks for sticking it out.

625
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:33,960
Yeah.

626
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:35,764
[Cell phone rings]

627
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:37,969
I got to take this.

628
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:40,238
- [Beep]
- You ok?

629
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,007
Cami, on phone: Yeah.

630
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:44,078
To be honest, not the worst
date I've had in this city.

631
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,747
Yeah. Seemed like you had him

632
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,618
wrapped around your finger
by the time I left.

633
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:48,682
More than that.

634
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:50,617
Vincent, Finn, whoever he is,

635
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,117
I think he likes me.

636
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,151
I don't know if I'd call that good news.

637
00:34:54,153 --> 00:34:56,619
Don't you get it? I'm his blind spot.

638
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:58,187
If he's distracted, he's vulnerable,

639
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:01,293
which means I can help take him down.

640
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:08,995
Jackson: Well, you got him. Great.

641
00:35:08,997 --> 00:35:10,864
Where's Ansel?

642
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:14,502
He was busy being a man.
He should be right behind us.

643
00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:17,973
Jack, I have to tell you...

644
00:35:17,975 --> 00:35:19,641
I already know, Ollie.

645
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:22,677
You sold me out to Francesca.

646
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,114
Look.

647
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:29,319
I know that I can't make up for that...

648
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,321
But you need to hear this.

649
00:35:33,323 --> 00:35:35,123
You're the one.

650
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:39,797
You're the Alpha.

651
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:42,332
Our people are not meant to be slaves.

652
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:48,142
You can free them.

653
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,216
[Coughing]

654
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,723
Ollie? Ollie? What is wrong with him?

655
00:35:58,725 --> 00:36:00,726
It's the witches.

656
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:01,929
Ollie?

657
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:03,698
They said he only had until midnight.

658
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,966
Stay with me.

659
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:07,167
[Coughing]

660
00:36:07,169 --> 00:36:08,733
Jack...

661
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,903
[Coughing]

662
00:36:57,235 --> 00:36:59,272
Oh...

663
00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:05,148
Wake up, brother.

664
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,850
Elijah...

665
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:10,554
Lenore: He won't wake, not yet,

666
00:37:10,556 --> 00:37:12,757
which gives you and I one last chance

667
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:15,294
to discuss my offer.

668
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:22,905
You promised me Elijah's safe return...

669
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:27,880
Or was that a lie

670
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,950
just like that ghoulish atrocity

671
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:31,751
outside claiming to be my father

672
00:37:31,753 --> 00:37:33,151
back from the dead?

673
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:34,817
Your father's return is real.

674
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,756
I pulled him from the other
side before it collapsed,

675
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,826
left him in the bayou to join the wolves,

676
00:37:39,828 --> 00:37:42,693
and I used the execution of one of his own

677
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:46,125
to draw him here, where
I knew he'd find you.

678
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:50,833
To what end besides my torment?

679
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:55,936
I brought him here to be
the father you never had,

680
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:59,808
to teach you to become the man
you always longed to be.

681
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,112
Once you are remade as a werewolf,

682
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,180
you can join him.

683
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:06,878
[Music playing]

684
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,849
His return

685
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:12,185
changes nothing.

686
00:38:12,187 --> 00:38:14,954
It changes everything.

687
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:18,120
It is my gift to you, Niklaus.

688
00:38:18,122 --> 00:38:21,993
This offer is your last
chance at salvation.

689
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:24,329
Reject me now, and you will live out

690
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:27,699
your endless days unloved and alone.

691
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:31,004
Do not refuse me out of some ancient spite.

692
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:35,408
Not spite, hatred,

693
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,710
a pure and perfect hatred that's

694
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:39,011
greater now than the day

695
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:40,379
I first took your life.

696
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:41,745
Why?

697
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:43,879
After all I've done to explain to you,

698
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:45,147
why must you persist...

699
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:48,385
Because you came for my child,

700
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:51,256
my daughter, your own blood!

701
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:53,857
You don't understand.

702
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:56,526
My child!

703
00:38:56,528 --> 00:38:59,762
Niklaus, I had to...

704
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,741
You declared war when you

705
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:13,012
came after my family, and for that,

706
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:17,179
I will make you suffer as only I can.

707
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:22,214
After all, I am my mother's son.

708
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:40,935
Esther: Please do not do this.

709
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:42,437
You wanted a family.

710
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:45,509
Fate said otherwise, and so you came to me,

711
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:48,409
and for a price, I granted your wish.

712
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:50,041
Now I must collect.

713
00:39:50,043 --> 00:39:51,577
When Mikael returns
from his journey, I swear...

714
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:53,778
You will tell him Freya grew ill and died.

715
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,912
No, Dahlia.

716
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:57,380
You were forced to burn her
body to stop the spread of plague.

717
00:39:57,382 --> 00:39:59,280
Sister, please, I cannot give up my child.

718
00:39:59,282 --> 00:40:00,613
You've already offered me more

719
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:02,378
than just this one child.

720
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,112
Our bargain was for this firstborn

721
00:40:04,114 --> 00:40:06,547
and every firstborn of each generation

722
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:08,448
that is to come for as long

723
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,250
as your line shall last.

724
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:14,715
You do this, if you take my daughter,

725
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:16,418
I swear to you, I will return

726
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,921
to the black arts, and I will grow in power

727
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:20,789
as a witch, and I will make you pay!

728
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:24,258
Your power is nothing against mine.

729
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,727
Foolish girl, you knew
the bargain you made,

730
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:32,393
and should you defy me,

731
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:35,960
then I will take all your children,

732
00:40:35,962 --> 00:40:38,799
including little Finn,

733
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:40,268
even unborn Elijah.

734
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,167
No. Dahlia...

735
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:46,837
- Mommy...
- Freya. Wait!

736
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:49,005
Mama!

737
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:52,642
Help! Mama!

738
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:00,644
Mama? What happened?

739
00:41:02,613 --> 00:41:06,986
Niklaus... Refused my offer.

740
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,091
Lenore: He's still burdened
with hatred for me...

741
00:41:14,928 --> 00:41:18,362
For what happened to his child.

742
00:41:18,364 --> 00:41:19,960
He's a fool.

743
00:41:19,962 --> 00:41:21,998
Your action saved this family.

744
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,868
If that child had lived...

745
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,104
Dahlia would return...

746
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:38,310
And she would come for us all.
