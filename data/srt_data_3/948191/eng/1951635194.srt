00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,600
 <i>IAN'S WIFE JANE PASSED AWAY.</i>

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,500
 <i>GABY MADE A NEW FRIEND.</i>

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,500
A "FRIEND" FRIEND,
NOT A GIRLFRIEND.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,800
 <i>THE FINGER OF GUILT...</i>
I THINK IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,500
 <i>POINTED TOWARD MIKE...</i>

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,300
THEYESTED MY WRENCH AND FOUND
TRACES OF THIS MONIQUE'S BLOOD.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,400
 <i>BUT HE STILL COULDN'T REMEMBER.</i>

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,900
 <i>BREE FOUND A BAG OF EVIDENCE.</i>

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
(Bree)
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,700
NOT UNTIL WE PUT <i>THESE</i>
BACK IN HER HOUSE.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,300
 <i>SON HAD A NIGHT...</i>

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,600
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
A GRANDCHILD.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,200
 <i>THAT HE'D SOON RATHER FORGET.</i>

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,700
YOU RAPED MY HUSBAND.

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,000
I COULD BE EXPECTING
RIGHT NOW. OHH!

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,200
 <i>(Mary Alice)</i>
 <i>IT HAD BEEN TWO MONTHS</i>

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,400
 <i>SINCE MIKE DELFINO</i>
 <i>HAD AWAKENED FROM HIS COMA,</i>

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,100
 <i>AND THE MEMORIES HE HAD LOST</i>

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,800
 <i>WERE FINALLY</i>
 <i>STARTING TO RETURN.</i>

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,300
 <i>HE COULD NOW RECALL</i>

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,900
 <i>THE FIRST TIME</i>
 <i>HE SAW WISTERIA LANE...</i>

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,400
 <i>AND THE FIRST TIME</i>
 <i>HE MET HIS NEW NEIGHBORS...</i>

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,600
 <i>AND THE FIRST TIME</i>
 <i>HE HEARD SUSAN MAYER LAUGH.</i>

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,600
 <i>BUT THE MEMORY HE MOST WANTED</i>
 <i>TO RECLAIM STILL ELUDED HIM.</i>

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,000
 <i>THAT'S WHY HE HAD GONE TO SEE</i>
 <i>A HYPNOTHERAPIST,</i>

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 <i>SO THAT HE COULD</i>
 <i>FINALLY REMEMBER EVERYTHING.</i>

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,400
I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER GET HERE.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,900
I'M SORRY.
THE TRAFFIC WAS TERRIBLE.

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,300
OOPS!

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,000
I CALLED MY LANDLORD
WHEN THE PIPE STARTED LEAKING,

33
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,100
AND HE RECOMMENDED YOU.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,100
I WAS SO FLUSTERED, I COULDN'T
FIND A PIECE OF PAPER.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
I WROTE YOUR NUMBER
ON MY HAND.

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,600
AFTER YOU FINISH THE SINK,

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,500
MAYBE YOU COULD
HELP ME WASH IT OFF.
LOOK...

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,700
I'M FLATTERED,
BUT I'M SEEING SOMEBODY.

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,300
ME, TOO...

40
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,900
BUT HE'S MARRIED,
AND I'M DRUNK.

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,100
WELL, YOUR, UH,
S-TRAP IS CRACKED.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,600
I DON'T HAVE ONE WITH ME.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,400
I'LL HAVE TO GO
TO A HARDWARE STORE.
NOW? IT'S LATE.

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,900
YEAH, WELL, THAT WATER'S
JUST GONNA KEEP SEEPING,

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,900
CAUSE A LOT MORE DAME.

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,300
I'LL, UH,
BE BACK IN AN HOUR.
I'LL BE WAITING.

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,900
MS. POLIER?

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,300
I'VE, UH... GOT THAT PART
FOR THE SINK.

49
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,300
HELLO?

50
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,100
WHAT HAPPENED, MIKE?

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,300
I ALMOST HAD IT.
I WAS SO CLOSE.
CLOSE TO WHAT?

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,300
WHEN I WENT BACK
TO MONIQUE'S PLACE,

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,900
SOMEBODY ELSE WAS THERE.
WHO?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,100
I DON'T KNOW.
I COULDN'T SEE IT.

55
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,400
 <i>YES, THERE WERE STILL</i>
 <i>MANY THINGS</i>

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,800
 <i>MIKE DELFINO</i>
 <i>COULDN'T REMEMBER...</i>

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,600
THEN WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,800
 <i>BUT HE'D FINALLY REMEMBERED</i>

59
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,300
 <i>THE MOST IMPORTANT THING</i>
 <i>OF ALL.</i>

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,500

 <i>AND BREE HODGE</i>
 <i>WAS FACED WITH A DILEMMA</i>

66

 <i>FAMILIAR</i>
 <i>TO COUNTLESS HOUSEWIVES.</i>

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,300
 <i>SHOULD SHE WAKE HER HUSBAND</i>
 <i>TO DISCUSS RECENT EVENTS</i>

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,500
 <i>THAT WERE WEIGHING HEAVILY</i>

 <i>BREE MADE THE OBVIOUS CHOICE.</i>

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,800
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'VE BEEN
OUT COLD FOR TEN HOURS,

72
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,100
ANWE NEED TO TALK.

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I REMEMBER
DRINKING THE SCOTCH

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,100
AND THEN
ALMA SUDDENLY SITTING UP.

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,500
BUT AFTER THAT, NOTHING.

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,100
OH, DEAR. I'M NOT SURE
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT...

77
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,500
AFTER ALMA KNOCKED YOU OUT,
SHE ASSAULTED YOU.

78
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
WHERE?

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
SEXUALLY.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
SHE HAD SEX WITH YOU.
OH, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

81
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,000
YOUR DRINK WAS LACED
WITH PILLS FOR...

82
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,800
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

83
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,100
BUT I WAS DEAD TO THE WORLD.

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,400
NO, DEAR,
YOU WERE DEAD TO THE WAIST.

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,600
I HAD SEX WITH ALMA,
AND I WASN'T EVEN CONSCIOUS?

86
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
HOW REMINISCENT
OF OUR MARRIAGE.

87
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,300
OKAY, THIS IS NO JOKE.

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
SHE RAPED YOU,
AND YOUR MOTHER HELPED.

89
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,500
LOOK, AFTER WE GET DRESSED,
WE'RE GOING TO THE POLICE.

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,400
I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,400
NO, I CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE.
NOT NOW, NOT EVER.

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
ORSON, YOUR EX-WIFE

STRAIGHT OUT OF "I, CLAUDIUS."

MONIQUE POLIER DIED.

PRETTY SEXY. IS SEXY
WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR

101
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,900

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL KEEP LOOKING.

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,700
WHY ARE YOU EVEN GOING?
WON'T IT BE WEIRD?

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,900
NO, IT'LL BE FINE.
IAN WANTS ME THERE.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,800
YEAH, BUT IT'LL BE ALL
OF JANE'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY,

106
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,300
AND YOU'LL BE THE OTHER WOMAN
WHO SWOOPED IN LIKE SOME--

107
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,200
OKAY, YES, IT'LL BE WEIRD.

108
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,400
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.
THIS IS ABOUT JANE AND IAN.

109
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,400
WHAT IF I WORE THIS ONE?

110
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,700
THEN IT'LL BE ABOUT
JANE, IAN AND YOUR BOOBS.

111
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,000
I HAVE GOT TO GET
MORE DEPRESSING CLOTHES.

112
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,600
OKAY, I JUST NEED
TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE

113
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,600
THROUGH THE MEMORIAL,
'CAUSE ONCE I GET THROUGH THIS,

114
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,500
IAN CAN OFFICIALLY INTRODUCE ME
AS HIS GIRLFRIEND,

115
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,100
AND WE'LL FINALLY BE A NORMAL,
NON-ADULTEROUS COUPLE.

116
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,600

120
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,200
I'M NOT GONNA GET YOU TOWELS
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

121
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,200

124
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,000
WELL, OKAY,
SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME?

125
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,700
YOU CAN BUY ME
THAT TOILET SEAT COVER.

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,600
UM, FINE. ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

127
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,600
CAI AT LEAST TAKE YOU OUT
FOR A BIRTHDAY DINNER?

128
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,800
THERE WILL BE NO CELEBRATION.
I'M TURNING 31.

129
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,000
I'M A SINGLE WOMAN
IN HER 30s.

130
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,800
I NOW HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE
TO "CAT FANCY." IT'S THE LAW.

131
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,100
AGE IS JUST A NUMBER.
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

132
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,100
IT MEANS SOMETHING TO <i>ME.</i>

133
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,800
BEING ALONE AT THIS AGE--
IT'S HARD,

134
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,800
AND IT'S
ONLY GONNA GET HARDER.

135
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,500
I'M SO DEPRESSED.

136
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,900
LET ME BUY YOU A CAR.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,400
NO, THANKS.

138
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,600
BUT I DO NEED A, UH,
LIQUID SOAP DISPENSER.

139
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,300
GO.

140
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,600
HELLO.

141
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
OH, SORRY.
DIDN'T MEAN TO DISTURB YOU.

142
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,700
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SEE
WHETHER OR NOT

143
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,300
THIS WAS A REGULAR KING
OR A CALIFORNIA KING.

144
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,300
WELL,
I THINK IT'S A REGULAR.

145
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,800
CALIFORNIA KINGS
ARE MUCH LONGER.

146
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,600
IS YOUR... WIFE
PARTICULARLY TALL?

147
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,800
OH, I'M, UH,
I'M NOT MARRIED.

148
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,200
OH. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TRY IT OUT?

149
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,700
THAT'S OKAY.
I CAN WAIT TILL YOU GET OFF.

150
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,700
OH, THAT'LL HAPPEN A LOT FASTER
IF YOU JUST HOP ON BOARD.

151
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,700
I'M SORRY?

152
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,300
IT WAS
A... SHAMELESS SEX JOKE.

153
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,500
I WAS FLIRTING WITH YOU.

154
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,900
OH! RIGHT!

155
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,700
(laughs) SORRY,
I CAN BE A LITTLE DENSE.

156
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,500
CAN WE START OVER?

157
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
NO. MOMENT'S GONE.
YOU KILLED IT.

158
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,500
UH, LOOK, YOU KNOW,
I'M IN A BIT OF A HURRY,

159
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,300
BUT MAYBE WE CAN, UH,
TRY THIS AGAIN SOMETIME.

160
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
IT COULD HAPPEN.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,100
HEY, SORRY I TOOK SO LONG.

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
MR. YOUNG?

163
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,400
OH.
YOU KNOW MY FRIEND...ZACH?

164
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,800
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

165
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
I'M LUKE... PURDUE?

166
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,700
I'M ON YOUR LEGAL TEAM.

167
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,700
I'M TAKING POINT
ON TALVERSON DEAL.

168
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,500
YEAH, RIGHT. HEY.

169
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,500
AGAIN,
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

170
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,400
SIR.

171
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,800
THAT WAS REALLY WEIRD.

172
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,900
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE GUY,
AND HE WORKS FOR ME.

173
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,200
WORKS FOR ME, TOO.

174
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
BREE--

175
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,200
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH ME.

176
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,500
ALL THIS TIME, YOU'VE SAID
YOU WANTED THE TRUTH.

177
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,300
THAT'S BEFORE
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

178
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,600
YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY I'VE TRIED
TO PROTECT YOU FROM THIS.

179
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,700
YEAH, BUT YOU WEREN'T JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT <i>ME,</i> WERE YOU?

180
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

181
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,400
EXONERATE MIKE.

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,400
HOW COULD YOU STAND BY
AND LET AN INNOCENT MAN

183
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,400
BE DRAGGED OFF TO PRISON?
YOU THINK
I HAVEN'T FELT TERRIBLE?

184
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,900
AND THIS,
AFTER HE'D BEEN IN A COMA

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,600
BECAUSE SOME LUNATIC
RAN HIM OVER.

186
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,800
HE HAS HAD A ROUGH YEAR.

187
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,300
I WANNA HELP MIKE.

188
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,300
HOW DO I DO THAT
WITHOUT IMPLICATING MYSELF?

189
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,200
I COULD GO TO JAIL.

190
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,200
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU GO TO JAIL.

191
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,200
YOU HAVE DONE A HORRIBLE THING,
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

192
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,600
I MEAN IT, ORSON.

193
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,700
IF YOU DON'T FIX THIS,
I WILL.

194
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
WELL, I GUESS
I'M IN NO POSITION TO ARGUE.

195
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,200
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

196
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,600
MORNING, ANDREW.
HEY, ORSON.

197
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,300
I-I WAS JUST GONNA ASK
IF YOU GUYS WANTED SOME COFFEE.

198
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,800
OH. YEAH. THANKS.
I COULD USE SOME.

199
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG DAY.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
(girl) THANK YOU.
(boy) THANKS.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,300
THANK YOU. THERE YOU GO.

202
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
MOM!

203
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,300
DINNER IS IN AN HOUR.
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

204
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
AND SO DO YOU.

205
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,300
I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT HE GAVE ME THE FACE.

206
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,500
YOU FELL FOR THE FACE.
WHAT ARE YOU, A ROOKIE?

207
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,100
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

208
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
SORRY, BUDDY.
MOM'S THE BOSS.

209
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,700
I FEEL NOTHING.

210
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,000
HI, LYNETTE. HEY, TOM.

211
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,400
YEAH?

212
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,500
HOW'S THE RESTAURANT GOING?
YOU READY FOR THE BIG OPENING?

213
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,200
OH, WE'RE GETTING THERE.
LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPON.

214
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,500
FREE EXTRA TOPPING
ON ANY MEDIUM OR LARGE.

215
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
WELL, HOW NICE.
(chuckles)

216
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,500
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD BE EVEN NICER?

217
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
HIRE MY NEPHEW
TO WORK FOR YOU.

218
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,300
YOU KNOW,
THE COUPON'S GOOD ALL WEEK.

219
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,000
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT LIES
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT AUSTIN,

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,100
BUT YOU CAN'T BE LISTENING
TO VICIOUS GOSSIP.

221
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,700
I HEARD HE GOT ARRESTED
FOR BEATING SOME GUY UP.

222
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
OKAY, THAT ONE'S
PRETTY ACCURATE.

223
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,900
EDIE, I'M ALL STAFFED UP.

224
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
OH, COME ON! HELP ME OUT.

225
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,400
SERIOUSLY,
EVER SINCE JULIE DUMPED HIM,

226
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,900
HE'S BEEN DEPRESSED AND MOPEY.
HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,300
 <i>PLEASE,</i>
ANY CRAPPY JOB YOU GOT.

228
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,400
WELL, I GUESS I COULD USE
AN EXTRA GUY IN BACK.

229
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,100
HAVE HIM THERE TOMORROW,
8:00 IN THE MORNING.

230
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU <i>SO,</i> SO MUCH.

231
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,100
(chuckles) UH, EDIE,
YOU--YOU FORGOT YOUR COUPON.

232
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
OH, TOM, PLEASE,

233
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
YOU'VE CHECKED OUT MY BUTT
ENOUGH TIMES

234
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
TO KNOW
THAT I D'T EAT PIZZA.

235
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,400
ZACH!
I KNOW. YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO BE ALONE FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,

236
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,300
BUT, UH, THAT'S JUST DUMB,
SO I'M GONNA TAKE YOU OUT.

237
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,700
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET,
BUT I, UH--
DON'T WORRY.

238
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,200
IT'S JUST GONNA BE ONE FRIEND
KEEPING ANOTHER FRIEND COMPANY.

239
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,200
IT'S NOT GONNA BE A DATE.
OH, WELL, UM, LUKE'S
GONNA BE HERE IN 20 MINUTES,

240
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,100
AND THAT KIND OF <i>WILL</i>
BE A DATE.

241
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,500
LUKE?

242
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,300
THAT'S, UH...
MY LAWYER GUY?

243
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,600
YEAH.
THAT ISN'T A PROBLEM, IS IT?

244
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
'CAUSE THIS IS WHAT
FRIENDS DO.

245
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,100
THEY TALK ABOUT
EACH OTHER'S DATES.

246
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
NO, I-I'M COOL.

247
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,200
HAVE A GREAT TIME.

248
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,200
UH, I'M GONNA
GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

249
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,600
SO YOU THINK
THIS GUY'S REALLY INTO YOU?

250
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,800
WELL, HE SEEMED TO LIKE ME
IN THE MATTRESS DEPARTMENT,

251
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,800
SO HERE'S HOPING I LIKE <i>HIM</i>
THE MATTRESS DEPARTMENT.

252
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,300
WHAT?
FRIENDS SAY THESE THINGS.

253
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,300
ORSON.
(chuckles)

254
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,200
OH, WELL, I'M IN LUCK.

255
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
THE WHOLE COVEN'S HERE.

256
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,400
I JUST STOPPED BY
TO SAY THANK YOU.

257
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,100
MM... YOU'RE WELCOME.

258
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,600
I BOUGHT A PREGNANCY TEST,
BUT IT'S TOO SOON TO TAKE IT.

259
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,600
I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT THE SEX.

260
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,500
THOUGH HATS OFF, MOTHER,
FOR COLLUDING IN MY RAPE.

261
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,700
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE CAN
STILL SURPRISE EACH OTHER.

262
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,700
NO, I WAS TALKING MORE ABOUT
WHAT YOU DID FOR ME AND BREE.

263
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
WHAT DID I DO?

264
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,000
YOUR LITTLE STUNT
MADE HER SO ANGRY,

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
SHE DEMANDED
WE GO  THE POLICE.

266
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,200
SHE FORCED MY HAND,

267
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,500
SO I TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

268
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
 <i>EVERYTHING?</i>
HMM.

269
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,300
THAT IS RATHER UNWISE.

270
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,000
I FACED MY WORST FEAR--

271
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
I MOMENT I FELT SURE
WOULD END MY MARRIAGE,

272
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,700
AND GUESS WHAT?

273
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
IT DIDN'T.

274
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,200
SHE FORGAVE YOU?

275
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,800
NOT ENTIRELY. NOT YET.

276
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,500
BUT SHE'LL COME AROUND.

277
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,900
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

278
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,400
THE MONTHS OF DREAD,
THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY...

279
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,300
THAT'S ALL OVER.

280
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,200
SO THANK YOU...

281
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,500
AND GOOD-BYE.

282
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,100
WAIT!

283
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,200
I COULD BE
CARRYING YOUR CHILD!

284
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,700
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'VE GOT
THE HODGE SEPTUPLETS IN THERE.

285
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,100
I'M STICKING WITH BREE.

286
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,300
WHY MUST HE MAKE EVERYTHING
SODIFFICULT?

287
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,300
OH, UH, FLOOR'S DONE.

288
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,400
I TOLD YOU I WANTED THIS FLOOR
TO SPARKLE LIKE YOUR MOM'S.

289
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,500
NOW DOES THIS FLOOR LOOK
"BREE HODGE" CLEAN TO YOU?

290
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,600
UH... NO. IT LOOKS
"ANDREW VAN DE KAMP" CLEAN.

291
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,400
BUT YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT IN ME
IS VERY BREE HODGE.

292
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,000
OKAY, JUST FOR THAT, YOU GET
TO HELP ME TAKE OUT THE TRASH.

293
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,400
I KNOW YOUHINK
I'M BEING A HARD-ASS,

294
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,900
BUT I'M JUST LOOKING

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
FOR A BASIC LEVEL
OF PROFESSIONALISM THAT...

296
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,300
UH...

297
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,600
AUSTIN?
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

298
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,900
JUST, UH, JUST TALKING
TO THE DELIVERY GUY.

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,900
HEY, WHERE'D HE GO?

300
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
ARE YOU HIGH?

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,500
ONLY...

302
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,800
TOTALLY.

303
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,200
AUSTIN!

304
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,100
DUDE, NOT SMART.

305
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
BUT--BUT I-I HAVE GOOD REASON,
AND--AND WHEN YOU HEAR IT,

306
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,500
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
THAT--THAT FACE ANYMORE.

307
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,000
JULIE MAYER DUMPED ME,
AND I'M VERY...

308
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,700
VERY UPSET.

309
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
YOUR FACE IS NOT CHANGING.

310
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,600
GET YOUR STUFF. GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY RESTAURANT.

311
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,400
YOU'RE FIRED. GO ON.

312
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
FLOOR'S LOOKING PRETTY CLEAN
RIGHT NOW, ISN'T IT?

313
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
YOU SAID
HE'D COME BACK TO ME.

314
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
YOU SAID DEEP DOWN,
HE STILL <i>LOVES</i> ME.

315
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,600
WELL, YOU HEARD HIM TODAY.
HE HATES ME!

316
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,600
YOU RAVISHED HIM
AGAINST HIS WILL.

317
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,600
HE'S BOUND TO BE TOUCHY
IN THE SHORT RUN.

318
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,100
I'LL HANDLE ORSON.
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT THE BABY.

319
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,900
HE SAID HE DOESN'T CARE.

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,100
HE SAYS THAT NOW,

321
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
BUT HE WILL NOT ABANDON
HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.

322
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,300
YOU'RE HIS FLESH AND BLOOD.
HE P <i>YOU</i> IN A <i>HOME.</i>

323
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,000
YOU KNOW, I USUALLY DON'T
SAY THIS TO EXPECTANT MOTHERS,

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,200
BUT FOR GOD SAKE,
HAVE A SCOTCH.

325
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,400
I SHOULD JUST
CALL THE POLICE.

326
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
WHAT?

327
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,200
I KNOW WHAT HE DID.

328
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
IF HE'S NEVER GONNA LOVE ME,
WHY SHOULD I PROTECT HIM?

329
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
I'D RATHER SEE HIM IN JAIL

330
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
THAN PLAYING HOUSE
WITH TAMMY TIGHTASS.

331
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,000
KNOCK IT OFF, ALMA.

332
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,500
I WILL MAKE ORSON
COME AROUND.

333
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ANYMORE.

334
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,500
SHE'S GOT HER CLAWS IN HIM,
AND SHE'S NOT LETTING GO.

335
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
DON'T BE SO SURE.

336
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,900
I WAS LOOKING OVER
AT THEIR HOUSE LAST NIGHT,

337
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,500
AND I SAW SOMETHING VERY...

338
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
CURIOUS.

339
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,100
WHAT?

340
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
YOU CAN'T SEE IT DOWN HERE.

341
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,000
WE NEED TO BE UP HIGHER.

342
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,400
HOW CAN YOU
SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE?

343
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
THERE'S NOT EVEN A WINDOW.

344
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
GLORIA?

345
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,100
GLORIA?!

346
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,900
JUST CALM DOWN, SWEETHEART.

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,400
GLORIA, LET ME OUT!

348
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,400
STRESS ISN'T GOOD
FOR THE BABY.

349
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! HEY!
(pounding on door)

350
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
GLORIA?!

351
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,000
SO HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

352
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,600
BETTER,
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

353
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,800
OH! NO, I WANNA, UM,
KEEP A LOW PROFILE.

354
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,800
BUT I'VE KISSED
A HUNDRED LIPS TODAY.

355
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,600
I ASSURE YOU, IT WOULD LOOK
MORE CONSPICUOUS IF I DIDN'T.

356
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,000
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

357
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,800
IAN, OH,
YOU MUST BE SHATTERED.

358
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,800
I KNOW I AM.
THANKS FOR COMING, LYNN.

359
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,700
OH.

360
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,400
MMM.

361
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,600
(chuckles) YOU KNOW,
JANE USED TO KID ME ABOUT YOU.

362
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,300
(Ian) HUH. DID SHE?

363
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,100
SHE'D SAY, "LYNN,
IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENS TO ME,

364
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I WANT YOU TO MARRY IAN."

365
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,400
(laughs) "YOU'RE PUSHY.

366
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,600
MAYBE YOU CAN GET HIM
TO PICK UP HIS SOCKS."

367
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,200
LISTEN, UM,
IF YOU EVER NEED TO TALK,

368
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,600
I'M HERE.

369
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
WHY DON'T YOU
STOP OVER SOME NIGHT

370
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,400
FOR A HOME-COOKED MEAL?

371
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,900
OH, THAT--THAT--
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU,

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,300
BUT I-I WOULDN'T DREAM
OF PUTTING YOU OUT.

373
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,200
WELL, I WON'T TAKED@"
FOR AN ANSWER.

374
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,200
HAVE YOU GOT MY NUMBER?

375
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,800
I SURE AS HELL DO.

376
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,300
WELL, I-I'M SURE I'LL FIND IT
IN JANE'S PHONE BOOK.

377
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,600
LET ME GIVE IT TO YOU,
JUST IN CASE.

378
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
CALL ANYTIME.

379
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,300
OOPS. WATCH YOURSELF.

380
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,100
SO I WAS THERE
ON A PLUMBING JOB.

381
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,200
IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE.

382
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,400
I HAD NO REASON
TO WANT HER DEAD.

383
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
HUH. I ALWAYS THOUGHT
HYPNOTHERAPY

384
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,800
WAS A BUNCH OF BULL,
BUT DAMN.

385
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,300
THIS IS HUGE, MAN.
YOU DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

386
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,000
THE MURDERER HAS TO BE
THIS YELLOW GLOVES GUY.

387
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,500

HOW MUCH I CONCENTRATE,

388
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,400
I STILL CAN'T SEE A FACE.
AH, YOU WILL.

389
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,900

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,300
I'M SORRY FOR EAVESDROPPING,
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

406
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,900
YOUR CONVERSATION
IS A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE?

407
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,900
I MEAN, WE'RE HERE TO GRIEVE,
NOT CRUISE.

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,100
I'M SORRY, AND YOU ARE...

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,800

IAN'S BEEN.

412
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,800
AND IF I WG@

413
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,400
IT'S NO BUSINESS OF YOURS.

414
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,400

I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY.

418
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,800
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
THEY'D PREFER TO KEEP IT QUIET.

419
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,900
I DON'T BELIEVE IT. IF THERE WAS
SOME BIMBO IN THE PICTURE,

420
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,900
I'D HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.

421
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,400
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
HE'S FREE MEAT.

422
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,300
OKAY, IT'S ME.

423
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,700

THIS WAS
A BUSINESS DECISION.

IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED--

IT'S GOING TO BE SERVED UPSTAIRS

502
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,000
AND INVOLVES WHIPPED CREAM.

503
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,400
IT IS PUDDING?

504
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,900
NO.

505
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
OH! YOU'RE FLIRTING.
YEAH.

506
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,600
(laughs) OKAY. DO IT AGAIN.
I SWEAR I'LL GET IT.

507
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,800
(chuckles) IT'S OKAY.
DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?

508
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,400
YOU BET I WANT COFFEE...
NICE AND HOT AND--

509
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,200
JUST FINISH YOUR SOUP,
AND WE'LL GET NAKED.

510
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
MRS. SOLIS.

511
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,400
I WORK WITH LUKE.
IS HE AVAILABLE?

512
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,900
CHARLES?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

513
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,600
YOU FORGOT TO INITIAL SOME PAGES
ON THE HALVERSON CONTRACT.

514
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,300
CAN'T THIS WAIT?

515
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,200
THE MARKET'S ALREA OPEN
IN TOKYO.

516
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,100
UH, GO AHEAD.
I'M GONNA OPEN SOME MORE WINE.

517
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,300
MR. YOUNG WANTS TO MAKE SURE
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT LAST PART.

518
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,900
DO YOU?

519
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
YEAH.

520
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,500
I GET IT.

521
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,600
SO WHEN WE THINK OF JANE,

522
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,200
LET US REMEMBER HER KIND HEART
AND HER LOVING SPIRIT.

523
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,300
AND NOW IF THERE'S SOMEONE WHO'D
LIKE TO SHARE A SPECIAL MEMORY

524
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,000
OF OUR DEAR FRIEND?

525
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,500
(Lynn) I WOULD.

526
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,500
HI. I'M LYNN DEAN.

527
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,100
JANE AND I
WERE SORORITY SISTS.

528
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,600
IFHE WERE HERE, SHE'D MAKE ME
SING OUR PLEDGE SONG,

529
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,600
BUT I THINK THERE'S ALREADY BEEN
ENOUGH GRIEF FOR ONE DAY.

530
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,900
NOW I KNOW HOW BADLY
WE'VE ALL FELT FOR IAN

531
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,500
DURING HIS LONG, LONELY VIGIL,

532
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,600
SO I'M SURE YOU'LL BE AS HAPPY
AS I WAS TO LEARN

533
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,100
HIS VIGIL WASN'T
QUITE SO LONELY AFTER ALL.

534
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,600
(under breath)
OH, DEAR GOD.

535
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,600
NO, HE FOUND
A WARM, CARING WOMAN

536
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,400
TO SHARE HIS BURDEN...

537
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,700
AND SO MUCH ELSE.

538
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,500
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FIND THE FACT
THAT SHE'S HE TODAY

539
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,400
INAPPROPRIATE,

540
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,600
BUT I THINK SHE'S A HERO.

541
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:21,400
SHE DARED TORAVE THE SCORN OF
THOSE WHO MIGHT FIND HER ACTIONS

542
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,000
QUESTIONABLE OR EVEN UNSAVORY.

543
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
OH. (chuckles)

544
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,300
I WAS GONNA ASK HER TO STAND,
BUT I SEE SHE ALREADY HAS.

545
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
SUSAN MAYER, SAY HELLO.

546
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,700
HEY.

547
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,800
WOW. (chuckles)

548
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
GUESS SOMEONE'S IN A HURRY
TO GET ON WITH THE EVENING.

549
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,900
YEAH.

550
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
WELL, I SHOULD GO.

551
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,900
WHAT?

552
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,800
I HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO
ON THAT HALVERSON DEAL.

553
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,600
SORRY.

554
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,800
BUT CAN'T IT WAIT
TILL AFTER DESSERT?

555
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,600
AND BY "DESSERT," I MEAN SEX.
YOU ARE CLEAR ON THAT, RIGHT?

556
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,000
PAINFULLY,
BUT MY JOB'S AT STAKE HERE.

557
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,500
I REALLY DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

558
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,900
OH, I THINK YOU'VE GOT
LOTS OF CHOICES.

559
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,700
HERE'S ONE OF THEM.

560
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,100
MMM!

561
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,300
HELLO?

562
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU' DOING?

563
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,300
WHAT?

564
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,300
I GAVE YOU AN ORDER,
AND I EXPECT YOU TO LLOW IT.

565
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,600
NOW GET OUT OF THERE.
Oh, I'm trying, sir.

566
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,700
I'm--It's just that
I'm meeting some resistance

567
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,500
to the <i>plan</i>
that we've agreed on.

568
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,000
OKAY, SHE'S NOT LETTING
YOU LEAVE? THAT'S FI.

569
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,500
HERE'S WHAT
I WANT YOU TO SAY.

570
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,900
UH-HUH.

571
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,000
OKAY, I'LL GIVE THAT
A SHOT, SIR.

572
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,300
IS THAT YOUR OFFICE?

573
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,900
YEAH, THEY, UH, THEY REALLY
NEED ME OVER THERE.

574
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,600
OKAY. SO COME BACK WHEN
YOU'RE DONE. I'LL WAIT UP.

575
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,800
I CAN'T.
NO, I REALLY CAN'T.

576
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
WHAT IS WITH YOU?!

577
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,700
AN HOUR AGO,
YOU WE REALLY INTO ME,

578
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,600
AND--AND NOW YOU CAN'T
GET OUT FAST ENOUGH.

579
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,000
OKAY. TRUTH?

580
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,800
I THOUGHT I COULD DO THIS,
BUT I CAN'T.

581
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,400
I'M JUST NOT ATTRACTED
TO YOU.

582
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,800
OF COURSE YOU ARE!

583
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,000
NO. SEE...

584
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,500
I REALLY ONLY DATE
WOMEN IN THEIR 20s.

585
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,700
WHAT?

586
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,000
SORRY.

587
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR ME.

588
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,100
I STILL GOT A LOT OF KICK
FOR AN OLD BROAD, DON'T I?!

589
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,800
AAH!

590
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,700
MOM?

591
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,700
MOM?

592
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,700
MOM, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

593
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,300
DON'T MOVE HER. SHE MIGHT HAVE
BROKEN SOMETHING.

594
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,900
YES, WE NEED
AN AMBULANCE, PLEASE,

595
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,500
AT 4354 WISTERIA LANE.

596
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,400
MY WIFE'S HAD A BAD FALL.
PLEASE HURRY.

597
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,500
How is this

598
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,700
??? WAS VERY LUCKY.

599
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,700
SHE ONLY SUFFERED
A SLIGHT CONCUSSION.

600
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,900
IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS,
THE DOCTOR SHOULD BE BACK SOON.
THANK YOU.

601
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,100
THANK GOD.
I WAS SO WORRIED.

602
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,300
YEAH, I'LL BET.

603
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,700
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

604
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,700
I HEARD YOU TWO YESTERDAY--

605
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,600
ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT YOU MAYBE GOING TO JAIL.

606
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,500
WELL, THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

607
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,700
BUT IF YOU THINK I HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH BREE FALLING--

608
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,400
I'M NOT STUPID.

609
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,400
I KNOW THE COPS HAVE BEEN ALL
OVER YOU ABOUT THAT DEAD WOMAN,

610
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,500
AND MOM SAID FOR YOU
TO FIX IT, OR SHE WOULD.

611
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,000
IS THIS--IS THIS "ACCIDENT"
HOW YOU FIXED IT?

612
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,900
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE UPSET.
I GET IT.
NO, NO, YOU <i>DON'T</i> GET IT.

613
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,400
THERE'S A REASON MY MOM PUT ME
OUT ON THE STREET LAST YEAR.

614
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
YOU'VE NEVER MET THAT GUY.
YOU'VE NEVER MET BAD ANDREW.

615
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,900
BUT HURT MY MOM,
AND YOU WILL.

616
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,200
I LOVE YOUR MOTHER.

617
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,700
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO PROTECT HER.

618
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,100
YEAH, SO AM I.

619
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,000
HI. I'M BREE HODGE'S SON.
YOU SEE THAT GUY RIGHT THERE?

620
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
THAT'S HER HUSBAND.

621
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,200
DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
LET HIM BE ALONE WITHER.

622
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,300
WHY?

623
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,500
BECAUSE IT'S HIS FAULT
THAT SHE'S IN HERE.

624
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,900
HE'S A DANGEROUS GUY.
NOW I'VE WARNED YOU.

625
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,500
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HER,
YOU'RE LIABLE.

626
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
NIGHT, DAD.

627
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,100
OH, YOU'RE HOME.

628
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,000
I THOUGHT YOU'D STILL BE OUT
ON YOUR DATE.

629
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,000
DATE'S OVER.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

630
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,000
OH, I-I THOUGHT SINCE I CAN'T
TAKE YOU OUT FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,

631
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,900
I'D AT LEAST
LEAVE YOU A PRESENT.

632
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,400
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S--IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE.

633
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,200
AW, ZACH! (giggles)

634
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,900
SO HOW'D YOUR DATE GO?

635
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,500
IS HE CRAZY?
YOU'RE NOT OLD.

636
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,200
HMM...

637
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,200
YOU DID NOT SEE THE LOOK ON HIS
FACE WHEN I TRIED TO KISS HIM.

638
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,100
IT'S LIKE HE WAS
SNIFFING EXPIRED MILK.

639
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,700
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE GORGEOUS,

640
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,600
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA
GET PRETTIER EVERY YEAR.

641
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,100
AW, THAT'S SO SWEET...

642
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,300
BUT IT'S A LIE.

643
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,200
EVERY TICK OF THE CLOCK
TAKES AWAY SOMETHING.

644
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,800
ZACH, WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WHEN I'M NOT PRETTY ANYMORE?

645
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

646
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,600
I'M GONNA
TAKE A LITTLE NAP, OKAY?

647
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,400
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

648
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,100
TAKE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

649
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,400
SUSAN, I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
FOR YOU.

650
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,600
I DIDN'T THINK
TO START WITH THE, UM...

651
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,800
EMBALMING ROOM.

652
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,900
YEAH. I'LL BE HAVING
NIGHT TERRORS FROM NOW ON...

653
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,500
(sniffles) WHICH I DESERVE.

654
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,800
LOOK, NO ONE IS JUDGING YOU.

655
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,300
IF ANYTHING, THEY'RE JUDGING
THAT DREADFUL LYNN.

656
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,000
I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU
FOR DRIVING HER AWAY.

657
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,100
IT USUALLY TAKES A CRUCIFIX
AND SOME GARLIC.

658
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,000
I'M SO SORRY
I RUINED JANE'S FUNERAL.

659
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,900
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

660
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,900
(sobbing) YES, I DID.

661
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,300
IT'S JUST...

662
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,700
WHAT?

663
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,200
I THOUGHT AFTER WE GOT THROUGH
THIS REALLY... PAINFUL DAY,

664
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
THINGS WOULD START
TO GET BETTER.

665
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,100
I THOUGHT I COULD BE
MORE A PART OF YOUR WORLD.

666
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,100
NOW ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY
ARE JUST GONNA THINK OF ME

667
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,600
AS THE CRAZY LADY
FROM JANE'S FUNERAL.

668
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,800
OH, GOD. OH, IAN.

669
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,300
OKAY, THIS IS NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT ME.

670
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,400
YOU SHOULD BE UPSTAIRS...
SAYING GOOD-BYE.

671
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,600
(sighs) I'M JUST GONNA HIDE OUT
HERE WITH THE DEPARTED

672
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,600
UNTIL EVERYBODY LEAVES.

673
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,900
NO.

674
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,600
NO MORE HIDING.

675
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,400
WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT
FAR TOO LONG

676
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,600
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

677
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,600
YOU HELPED ME THROUGH THE MOST
DIFFICULT PART OF MY LIFE.

678
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,600
I LOVE YOU, AND I WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

679
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

680
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,100
IAN,
ARE YOU PROPOSING TO ME?

681
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,700
WELL...
I GUESS MAYBE I... I AM.

682
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,800
WHOA, WHOA! UM, BEFORE YOU
SAY ANOTHER WORD...

683
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,600
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

684
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
AH. RIGHT.

685
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,500
I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT A LOT
ABOUT THIS MOMENT,

686
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,600
BUT--BUT WHEN I DID, UM,

687
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,000
THE TABLE WE WERE AT
DIDN'T HAVE A BLOOD GUTTER.

688
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,000
THEN MAY I
REOPEN THE SUBJECT

689
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,900
AT A MORE OPPORTUNE
TIME AND PLACE?

690
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,600
YES.

691
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,100
I ACCEPT
YOUR PROPOSAL TO PROPOSE.

692
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,000
SHALL WE?

693
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,800
NOW I WANT YOU TO DIG DEEP.

694
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,000
IF YOU FEEL
YOUR MEMORY BLOCKED,

695
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,200
JUST COUNT TO THREE,
AND THE BLOCK WILL MELT AWAY.

696
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,100
IT IS NATURAL AND EASY
FOR YOU TO RECALL YTHING.

697
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,200
NOW REMEMBER
MONIQUE POLIER.

698
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,400
REMEMBER THE NIGHT
YOU MET HER.

699
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,000
MS. POLIER?

700
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,900
I'VE, UH... GOT THAT PART
FOR THE SINK.

701
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,000
HELLO?

702
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,100
SORRY. UH, MONIQUE'S UPSTAIRS
TAKING A NAP.

703
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,300
SHE WASN'T FEELING WELL.

704
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,300
MIKE?
DID YOU SEE SOMETHING?

705
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,500
I'M HER BOYFRIEND.

706
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,700
I, UH, AHEM, FIGURED SHE'D WANT
TO WAKE UP TO A CLEAN KITCHEN.

707
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
UH, WELL, I'LL JUST
FINISH UP WITH THE SINK

708
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,400
AND BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

709
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,800
UH, WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE CARE OF THE SINK?

710
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,100
I MEAN, I'M PRTY HANDY,
AND IT'S GETTING LATE.

711
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,000
OH, I DON'T MIND STAYING.

712
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,600
NO, LOOK, IT'S OKAY.
I-I GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

713
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,300
HERE.

714
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,900
WELL, THIS SHOULD COVER
WHAT WE OWE YOU.

715
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,700
TELL MS. POLIER
I HOPE SHE FEELS BETTER.

716
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,500
WILL DO.

717
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,600
OH, HEY...

718
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,800
DON'T FORGET YOUR WRENCH.

719
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,600
MIKE?
WH--WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

720
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,800
MIKE!

721
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,300
UH, HEY, MR. DELFINO.

722
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,800
I NEED TO, UH,
TALK TO YOUR STEPDAD.

723
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,600
ORSON'S NOT HERE. HE WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL WITH MY MOM.

724
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,500
SHE'S FINE!
THANKS FOR ASKING!
