1
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,240
How's your blog going?

2
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,200


3
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,600
Yeah, good, very good.

4
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,280
You haven't written a word, have you?

5
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,120
You just wrote "still has trust issues".

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,160
And you read my writing upside down.

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,800
You see what I mean?

8
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,720
John, you're a soldier

9
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,360
and it's going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life

10
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,200
and writing a blog  about everything that happens to you will honestly help you.

11
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,680
Nothing happens to me.

12
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,760


13
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,680
- What do you mean there's no ruddy car?' - He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.

14
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,360
- Get a cab! - I never get cabs!

15
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
- I love you. - When?

16
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,400
Get a cab!

17
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,000
My husband

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,200
was a happy man who lived life to the full.

19
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,520
He loved his family and his work,

20
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,040
and that he should have taken his own life in this way

21
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,080
is a mystery

22
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,400
and a shock to all who knew him.

23
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,200
Taxi, taxi!

24
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,760


25
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
- I'll be just two minutes, mate. - What?

26
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,200
- I'm just going home to get my umbrella. - You can share mine.

27
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,640
Two minutes, all right?

28
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,800


29
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,320


30
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,440
She still dancing?

31
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,240
Yeah, if you can call it that.

32
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,320
- Did you get the car keys off her?  - Got them out of her bag.

33
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,960
Where is she?

34
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
The body of Beth Davenport, Junior Minister for Transport,

35
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,920
was found late last night on a building site in Greater London.

36
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,560
Preliminary investigations suggest that this was suicide.

37
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,520
We can confirm that this apparent suicide closely resembles those of

38
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,280
Sir Jeffrey Patterson and James Phillimore.

39
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,920
In the light of this, these incidents are now being treated as linked.

40
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,020
The investigation is ongoing

41
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,920
but Detective Inspector Lestrade  will take questions now.

42
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,280
Detective Inspector,  how can suicides be linked?

43
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,400
Well, they all took the same poison.

44
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,600
They were all found in places they had no reason to be.

45
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,180
None of them had shown any prior indication.

46
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,760
But you can't have serial suicides.

47
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,440
Well, apparently you can.

48
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,480
These three people,  there's nothing that links them?

49
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,000
There's no link we've found yet but

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
we're looking for it. There has to be one.

51
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,400


52
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,520


53
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,760


54
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760


55
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720


56
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,880


57
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,600


58
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,960


59
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,560


60
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,880


61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,560
- If you've all got texts, please  ignore them. - It just says "Wrong".

62
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
Well, just ignore that. If there are no more questions,

63
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm going to bring this session to an end.

64
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,280
If they're suicides, what are you investigating?

65
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,600
As I say, these suicides are clearly linked.

66
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,280
It's an unusual situation, we've got our best people investigating.

67
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,520


68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,640


69
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,880


70
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880


71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,840


72
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,000


73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,720


74
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080


75
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,680


76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,160
Says "Wrong" again.

77
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,360
- One more question. - Is there any  chance that these are murders?

78
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,120
And if they are, is this the work of a serial killer?

79
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,960
I know that you like writing about these but these do appear to be suicides.

80
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,000
We know the difference. The poison was clearly self-administered.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,040
Yes, but if they are murders, how do people keep themselves safe?

82
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,600
Well, don't commit suicide.

83
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,960
Daily Mail!

84
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,900
This is a frightening time for people

85
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,840
but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions.

86
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
We are all as safe as we want to be.

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,360


88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480


89
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,720


90
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720


91
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,680


92
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,680


93
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,680


94
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,680


95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,680
Thank you.

96
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,800
You've got to stop him doing that. He's making us look like idiots.

97
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
If you can tell me how he does it, I'll stop him.

98
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
John!

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,080
John Watson!

100
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,440
Stamford, Mike Stamford. We were at Barts together.

101
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
- Yes, sorry, yes, Mike.  - Hello.

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,840


103
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,320
- Yes, I know, I got fat. - No, no.

104
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,120
I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at. What happened?

105
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,600
I got shot.

106
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,600
Are you still at Barts then?

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
Teaching now, yeah, bright young things

108
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,880
like we used to be.

109
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,960
God, I hate them.

110
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,680
What about you, just staying in town till you get yourself sorted?

111
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,440
I can't afford London on an Army pension.

112
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,800
Couldn't bear to be anywhere else. That's not the John Watson I know.

113
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm not the John Watson.

114
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,560
Couldn't Harry help?

115
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,640
Yeah, like that's going to happen.

116
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,680
I don't know, get a flatshare or something?

117
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,480
What?

119
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,920
You're the second person to say that to me today.

120
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,280
Who was the first?

121
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,840
How fresh?

122
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,720
Just in. 67, natural causes.

123
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,880
Used to work here. I knew him, he was nice.

124
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,120
Fine.

125
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,280
We'll start with the riding crop.

126
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,080
So, bad day was it?

127
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,300
I need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes.

128
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,200
A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

129
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,520
Listen, I was wondering. Maybe later, when you're finished...

130
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,600
You're wearing lipstick.  You weren't wearing lipstick before.

131
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,560
I refreshed it a bit.

132
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,080
Sorry, you were saying?

133
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,880
I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee?

134
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,600
Black, two sugars, please.  I'll be upstairs.

135
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,160
OK.

136
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,280
- Bit different from my day. - You've no idea!

137
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,480
Mike, can I borrow your phone?  There's no signal on mine.

138
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,360
- And what's wrong with the landline?  - I prefer to text.

139
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,520
Sorry, it's in my coat.

140
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,280
Here, use mine.

141
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,800
Oh, thank you.

142
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,920
This is an old friend of mine, John Watson.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,320
Afghanistan or Iraq?

144
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,520
- Sorry? - Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

145
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,840
Afghanistan, sorry, how did you know?

146
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,960
Ah! Molly, coffee, thank you.

147
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,520
What happened to the lipstick?

148
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,360
It wasn't working for me.

149
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,560
Really? It was a big improvement. Your mouth's too small now.

150
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,120
OK.

151
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,760
How do you feel about the violin?

152
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,520
I'm sorry, what?

153
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,500
I play the violin when I'm thinking

154
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,480
and sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you?

155
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,680
Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.

156
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,480
- You told him about me? - Not a word.

157
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,360
Who said anything about flatmates?

158
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,520
I did. Told Mike this morning

159
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,680
that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

160
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,920
Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from

161
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,760
military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't a difficult leap.

162
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,200
How did you know about Afghanistan?

163
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,440
Got my eye on a nice little place in central London.

164
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,120
We ought to be able to afford it.

165
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,200
We'll meet there tomorrow evening, seven o'clock.

166
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,120
Sorry, got to dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.

167
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,680
Is that it?

168
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,640
Is that what?

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,360
We've only just met and we're going to go and look at a flat?

170
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
Problem?

171
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,200
We don't know a thing about each other.

172
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,720
I don't know where we're meeting, I don't even know your name.

173
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,760
I know you're an Army doctor and you've been invalided home  from Afghanistan.

174
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,880
You've got a brother worried about you but you won't go to him for help

175
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,200
because you don't approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic,

176
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,520
more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.

177
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,800
And I know that your therapist thinks

178
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,080
your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid.

179
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,560
That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?

180
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,760
The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street.

181
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,280
Afternoon.

182
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,960
Yeah, he's always like that.

183
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,160


184
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,960


185
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,960


186
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,960


187
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,960


188
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,440


189
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960


190
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,000


191
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,000


192
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,200
Hello.

193
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,240
- Ah - Mr Holmes. - Sherlock, please.

194
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,600
Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.

195
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Mrs Hudson, the landlady -  she's given me a special deal.

196
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,980
Owes me a favour. A few years back,

197
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,360
her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida.

198
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,280
- I was able to help out. - Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed?

199
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,840
Oh, no, I ensured it.

200
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,480
Sherlock!

201
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,040
Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.

202
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,540
Hello. Come in.

203
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,040
- Thank you. - Shall we...?

204
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,720
Well, this could be very nice.

205
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,080
Very nice indeed.

206
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,440
Yes.

207
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,960
Yes, I think so, my thoughts precisely.

208
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,900
So I went straight ahead and moved in.

209
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,840
Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out...

210
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,040
- So this is all... - Well, obviously I can...straighten things up a bit.

211
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,120
- That's a skull. - Friend of mine.

212
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,760
When I say friend...

213
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,840
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

214
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,840
There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

215
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Of course we'll be needing two.

216
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,860
Don't worry, there's all sorts round here.

217
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,680
Mrs Turner next door's got married ones.

218
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,520
Oh...Sherlock! The mess you've made.

219
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,720
I looked you up on the internet last night.

220
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,200
- Anything interesting?  - Found your website. The Science of Deduction.

221
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,520
What did you think?

222
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,700
You said you could identify a software designer by his tie

223
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,440
and an airline pilot by his left thumb?

224
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,720
Yes.

225
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,360
And I can read your military career in your face and your leg,

226
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,440
and your brother's drinking habits on your mobile phone.

227
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,560
How?

228
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,540
What about these suicides then, Sherlock?

229
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,640
I thought that'd be right up your street.

230
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,160
Three exactly the same.

231
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,400
Four.

232
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,960
- There's been a fourth. And there's something different this time. - A fourth?

233
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,640
- Where? - Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

234
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,480
What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

235
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,510
- You know how they never leave notes? - Yeah.

236
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,120
This one did.Will you come?

237
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,000
- Who's on forensics?  - Anderson.

238
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,680
He doesn't work well with me.

239
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,320
- Well, he won't be your assistant. - I NEED an assistant.

240
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,920
- Will you come? - Not in a police car, I'll be right behind.

241
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,720
Thank you.

242
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Brilliant! Yes!

243
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,600
Four serial suicides, and now a note.

244
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,670
Oh, it's Christmas.

245
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,760
Mrs Hudson, I'll be late. Might need some food.

246
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,520
I'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper.

247
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,120
Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

248
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,880
Don't wait up!

249
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,400
Look at him, dashing about...

250
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,040
My husband was just the same.

251
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,440
But you're more the sitting-down type, I can tell.

252
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
I'll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg.

253
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,200
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry -

254
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,120
It's just sometimes this bloody thing...

255
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,960
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

256
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,660
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.

257
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,960
Just this once, dear, I'm not your housekeeper.

258
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,720
- Couple of biscuits too, if you've got 'em. - Not your housekeeper!

259
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,230


260
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,880
You're a doctor.

261
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,600
In fact you're an Army doctor.

262
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,960
Yes.

263
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,440
Any good?

264
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,480
Very good.

265
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,280
Seen a lot of injuries, then. Violent deaths.

266
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,320
Well, yes.

267
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,920
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

268
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,200
Of course. Yes. Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

269
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
- Want to see some more? - Oh, God, yes.

270
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,040
- Sorry Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea. Off out. - Both of you?

271
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,360
Impossible suicides? Four of them?

272
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,520
No point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on!

273
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,920
- Look at you, all happy. It's not decent. - Who cares about decent?

274
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,320
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

275
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,440
Taxi!

276
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
OK, You've got questions...

277
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,760
Yeah, where are we going?

278
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,200
Crime scene. Next?

279
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,360
- Who are you, what do you do? - What do you think?

280
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,960
- I'd say...private detective. - But?

281
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
But the police don't go to private detectives.

282
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,600
I'm a consulting detective. Only one in the world, I invented the job.

283
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,670
What does that mean?

284
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,840
Means when the police are out of their depth, which is always,

285
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,800
- they consult me. - The police don't consult amateurs.

286
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,440
When I met you for the first time yesterday,

287
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,720
I said Afghanistan or Iraq. You looked surprised.

288
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,800
- Yes, how DID you know? - I didn't know, I saw.

289
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,720
Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military.

290
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,200
- But your conversation... - Bit different from my day.

291
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,120
..said trained at Barts. So Army doctor, obvious.

292
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,880
Your face is tanned...

293
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,280
but no tan above the wrists. You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.

294
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,320
Your limp's really bad when you walk,

295
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,360
but you don't ask for a chair when you stand

296
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
so it's at least partly psychosomatic.

297
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,520
That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic -

298
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,450
wounded in action then.

299
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,440
Wounded in action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

300
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,160
You said I had a therapist.

301
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,280
You've got a psychosomatic limp, of course you've got a therapist.

302
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,160
Then there's your brother. Your phone.

303
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,200
It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player.

304
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,440
And you're looking for a flatshare. You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

305
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,680
Scratches. Not one, many over time -

306
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,640
it's been in the same pocket as keys and coins.

307
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,840
You wouldn't treat your one luxury item like this,

308
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,040
so it's had a previous owner.

309
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,960
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

310
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,520
The engraving?

311
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,560
Harry Watson. Clearly a family member who's given you his old phone.

312
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,800
Not your father, this is a young man's gadget.

313
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,840
Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live

314
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,970
unlikely you've got an extended family,certainly was one you're close to.

315
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,630
So brother it is. Now, Clara who's Clara?

316
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,720
Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment.

317
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,120
The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend.

318
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,680
Must have given it to him recently, it's only six months old.

319
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,360
Marriage in trouble then - six months on he's given it away.

320
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,640
If she'd left HIM, he would have kept it. People do it,sentiment.

321
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,520
No, he wanted rid of it. He left HER.

322
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,960
He gave the phone to you, so he wants you to stay in touch.

323
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,890
You're looking for cheap accommodation,

324
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,120
but you are not going to your brother for help

325
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,900
that says you've got problems with him.

326
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,720
Maybe you liked his wife, or don't like his drinking.

327
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,800
How can you possibly know about the drinking?

328
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,920
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

329
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,200
Power connection - tiny little scuff marks round it.

330
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,720
Every night he plugs it in but his hands are shaking.

331
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,800
You never see those marks on a sober man's phone,

332
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
never see a drunk's without them.

333
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,760
There you go, you see, you were right.

334
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,160
I was right? Right about what?

335
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,440
The police don't consult amateurs.

336
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,920
That...was amazing.

337
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,920
- Do you think so? - Of course it was.

338
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,280
It was extraordinary, it was quite extraordinary.

339
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,160
- That's not what people normally say. - What do people normally say?

340
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,640
Piss off!

341
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,120
Did I get anything wrong?

342
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,040
Harry and me don't get on, never have,

343
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,200
Clara and Harry split up three months ago

344
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,280
and they're getting a divorce,

345
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,760
and Harry is a drinker.

346
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,520
Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything.

347
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,570
- Harry's short for Harriet. - Harry's your sister.

348
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,280
- Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here? - Sister!

349
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
- No,seriously, what am I doing here? - There's always something.

350
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,320
- Hello, freak! - I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade.

351
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,840
Why?

352
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,040
I was invited.

353
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
- Why? - I think he wants me to take a look.

354
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,560
- Well, you know what I think, don't you? - Always Sally.

355
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,640
I even know you didn't make it home last night.

356
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,480
- I don't... Who's this? - Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

357
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,280
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

358
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,840
Old friend.

359
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,520
A colleague? How do YOU get a colleague?

360
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,840
Did he follow you home?

361
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,400
- Would it be better if I just waited... - No.

362
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,520
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

363
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,160
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

364
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,080
It's a crime scene. I don't want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?

365
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,200
Quite clear.

366
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,080
And is your wife away for long?

367
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,760
Oh, don't pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that.

368
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,160
Your deodorant told me that.

369
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,280
My deodorant?

370
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,080
- It's for men. - Well, of course it's for men - I'm wearing it.

371
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,320
So's Sergeant Donovan.

372
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,720
Ooh... I think it just vaporised. May I go in?

373
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,700
- Whatever you're trying to imply... - I'm not implying anything.

374
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,890
I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat,

375
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,080
and just happened to stay over.

376
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,760
And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.

377
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,520
You'll need to wear one of these.

378
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,960
Who's this?

379
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,520
He's with me.

380
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,160
- But who is he? - I said he's with me.

381
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,440
Aren't you going to put one on?

382
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,160
- So where are we? - Upstairs.

383
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,760
I can give you two minutes.

384
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
May need longer.

385
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,760
Her name's Jennifer Wilson according to her credit cards,

386
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,440
we're running them now for contact details.

387
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200
Hasn't been here long.

388
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,800
Some kids found her.

389
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,200
Shut up.

390
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,680
- I didn't say anything. - You were thinking. It's annoying.

391
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200


392
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480


393
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,000
Rache

394
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,830


395
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,360


396
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,880


397
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,320


398
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,120


399
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,720


400
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,830


401
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,960


402
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,960


403
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480


404
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,830


405
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,800


406
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,040


407
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,160
Got anything?

408
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Not much.

409
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,360
She's German.

410
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,920
Rache. It's German for revenge. She could be trying to tell us something...

411
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,880
Yes, thank you for your input.

412
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,600


413
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,160
- So she's German? - Of course she's not. She's from out of town though.

414
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,880
Intended to stay in London for one night

415
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,040
before returning home to Cardiff.  So far, so obvious.

416
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,080
Sorry - obvious?

417
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
What about the message though?

418
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,560
Dr Watson, what do you think?

419
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,920
- Of the message?  - Of the body. You're a medical man.

420
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,520
We have a whole team right outside.

421
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,430
They won't work with me.

422
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,230
I'm breaking every rule letting you in here...

423
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,000
Yes...because you need me.

424
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,360
Yes, I do.

425
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,640
God help me.

426
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,400
Dr Watson!

427
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,160
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

428
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,040
Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes...

429
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,360
What am I doing here?

430
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,630
Helping me make a point.

431
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,220
I'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent.

432
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,080
This is more fun.

433
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,400
Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

434
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,920
Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper.

435
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,830
Asphyxiation, probably.

436
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,800
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

437
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,520
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

438
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,720
It could have been a seizure. Possibly drugs.

439
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
You know what it was, you've read the papers.

440
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,880
Well, she's one of the suicides. The fourth...?

441
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
Sherlock - two minutes, I said,

442
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,880
I need anything you got.

443
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,200
Victim is in her late 30s.

444
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,480
Professional person, going by her clothes -

445
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,760
I'm guessing the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink.

446
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,080
Travelled from Cardiff today intending to stay in London one night.

447
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,700
It's obvious from the size of her suitcase.

448
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,050
- Suitcase? - Suitcase. Yes.

449
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,680
She's been married  at least ten years, but not happily.

450
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,480
She's had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married.

451
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,760
Oh, for God's sake, if you're just making this up...

452
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,320
Her wedding ring. Ten years old at least.

453
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,200
The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned,

454
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,580
but not her wedding ring. Status of her marriage, right there.

455
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,540
The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside.

456
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,930
That means it's regularly removed.

457
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,160
The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger.

458
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,940
It's not for work, look at her nails.

459
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,830
She doesn't work with her hands,

460
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,520
so what or other who does she remove her rings for?

461
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,070
Clearly not one lover, she'd never sustain

462
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,700
the fiction of being single for that matter of time,

463
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,200
- so more likely a string of them. Simple. - Brilliant.

464
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,640
- Sorry. - Cardiff?

465
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,880
- It's obvious, isn't it?  - It's not obvious to me.

466
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,080
Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains,

467
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,160
it must be so boring. Her coat -

468
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,880
it's slightly damp, she's been in heavy rain the last few hours -

469
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,600
no rain anywhere in London in that time.

470
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,460
Under her coat collar is damp too.

471
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,240
She's turned it up against the wind.

472
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,800
She's got an umbrella in her left pocket but it's dry and unused.

473
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,360
Not just wind, strong wind - too strong to use her umbrella.

474
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,040
We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight

475
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,480
so she must come from a decent distance

476
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,130
but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours

477
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,190
because her coat still hasn't dried.

478
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,690
So - where has there been heavy rain and strong wind

479
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,800
within the radius of that travel time?

480
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,120
Cardiff.

481
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,440
- Fantastic. - Do you know you do that out loud?

482
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,080
- Sorry, I'll shut up. - No, it's...fine.

483
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,730
Why do you keep saying suitcase?

484
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,120
Yes, where is it?

485
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,420
She must have had a phone or an organiser.

486
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,570
Find out who Rachel is.

487
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,160
She was writing Rachel?

488
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,080
No, she was leaving an angry note in German -

489
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,720
of course she was writing Rachel, no other word it can be.

490
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,980
The question is why did she wait until she was dying to write it?

491
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,760
How do you know she had a suitcase?

492
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,040
Back to the right leg, tiny splash marks on her heeling calf,

493
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,310
not present on the left.

494
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,010
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand,

495
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,360
get that splash pattern on the other way.

496
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,520
Smallish case, going by the spread.

497
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,280
Case that size,  woman this clothes-conscious -

498
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,760
could only be an overnight bag

499
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,000
so we know she was staying one night.

500
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,680
Where is it, what have you done with it?

501
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,520
There wasn't a case.

502
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,120
Say that again.

503
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase.

504
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,200
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?

505
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
Was there a suitcase in this house?

506
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
Sir, there was no case!

507
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,910
But they take the poison themselves,

508
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,360
they choose swallow the pills themselves.

509
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,610
There are clear signs, even you lot couldn't miss them.

510
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,920
Right, thanks. And...?

511
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,040
It's murder, all of them. I don't know how.

512
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,400
But they're not suicides, they're killings, they're serial killings.

513
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,380
We've got ourselves a serial killer. I'd love those.

514
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,760
There's always something to look forward to.

515
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,050
Why are you saying that?

516
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,310
Her case! Come on, where is her case?

517
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,300
Did she eat it?

518
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,620
Someone else was here, and they took her case.

519
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,630
So the killer must have driven here.

520
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,880
Forgot the case was in the car.

521
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,080
She could have checked into a hotel, left it there.

522
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,480
No, she never got to the hotel, look at her hair.

523
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,160
She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes.

524
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,920
She'd never have left any hotel  with her hair still looking...

525
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,480
Sherlock? What is it, what?

526
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,420
Serial killers, always hard.

527
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,200
You have to wait for them to make a mistake.

528
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,040
We can't just wait!

529
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,360
Oh, we're done waiting. Look at her, really look!

530
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,640
Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff.

531
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,000
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends were.

532
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,760
Find Rachel!

533
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,640
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

534
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,760
Pink!

535
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,600
Let's get on with it...

536
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,720
- He's gone. - Sherlock Holmes?

537
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,000
Yeah, he just took off. He does that.

538
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,080
- Is he coming back? - Didn't look like it.

539
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,040
Right.

540
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,760
Right...

541
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

542
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,320
Brixton.

543
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,200
Do you know where I could get a cab?

544
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,860
It's just er...well...my leg.

545
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,720
Try the main road.

546
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,880
Thanks.

547
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,440
But you're not his friend.

548
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,400
He doesn't have friends.

549
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,560
So who are you?

550
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,440
I'm...I'm nobody. I just met him.

551
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,440
OK, bit of advice then.  Stay away from that guy.

552
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,440
Why?

553
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,620
You know why he's here?

554
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,840
He's not paid or anything.

555
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,160
He likes it. He gets off on it.

556
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,700
The weirder the crime, the more he gets off.

557
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,600
And you know what...?

558
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,760
One day just showing up won't be enough.

559
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,160
One day we'll be standing round a body

560
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,040
and Sherlock Holmes'll be the one that put it there.

561
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,120
- Why would he do that? - Because he's a psychopath.

562
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,680
Psychopaths get bored.

563
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,640
- Donovan! - Coming.

564
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,120
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

565
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,720
Taxi! Taxi...

566
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,360
Hello?

567
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,880
There is a security camera  on the building to your left.

568
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,360
Do you see it?

569
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,800
Who's this?

570
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,120
Who's speaking?

571
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,080
Do you see the camera, Dr Watson?

572
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,400
- Yeah, I see it. - Watch...

573
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,050
There is another camera on the building opposite you.

574
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,320
Do you see it?

575
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,600
And finally, at the top of  the building on your right.

576
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,160
How are you doing this?

577
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,320
Get into the car, Dr Watson.

578
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,270
I would make some sort of threat,

579
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,840
but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you.

580
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,840
- Hello. - Hi.

581
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,120
What's your name, then?

582
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,840
Er...Anthea.

583
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,680
- Is that your real name? - No.

584
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm John.

585
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,960
Yes. I know.

586
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,360
Any point in asking...  where I'm going?

587
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,240
None at all...

588
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,520
John.

589
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,240
OK.

590
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,040
Have a seat, John.

591
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,440
You know, I've got a phone.

592
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,480
I mean, very clever and all that,

593
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,560
but er...

594
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,240
you could just phone me.

595
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,680
On my phone.

596
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,110
When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes,

597
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,480
one learns to be discreet, hence this place.

598
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,280
Your leg must be hurting you.  Sit down.

599
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,760
I don't want to sit down.

600
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,200
You don't seem very afraid.

601
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,880
You don't seem very frightening.

602
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,520
Yes...

603
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,480
The bravery of the soldier.

604
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,040
Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think?

605
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,520
What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?

606
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,160
I don't have one. I barely know him, I met him...yesterday.

607
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,320
and since yesterday you've moved in with him

608
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,480
and now you're solving crimes together.

609
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,760
Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?

610
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,280
- Who are you? - An interested party.

611
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,240
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

612
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,320
I'm guessing you're not friends.

613
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,720
You've met him. How many friends do you imagine he has?

614
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,760
I am the closest thing to a friend

615
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,130
that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.

616
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,360
And what's that?

617
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,040
- An enemy. - An enemy?

618
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,920
In HIS mind, certainly.

619
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,560
If you were to ask him, he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

620
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,440
He does love to be dramatic.

621
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,760
Well, thank God. You're above all that.

622
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
I hope I'm not distracting you.

623
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,360


624
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,360


625
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,360


626
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,360


627
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
Not distracting me at all.

628
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,560
Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?

629
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
I could be wrong...

630
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,360
but I think that's none of your business.

631
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,080
- It could be. - It really couldn't.

632
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,000
If you DO move into, erm...

633
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,040
..221B Baker Street,

634
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,280
I'd be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money

635
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,000
on a regular basis to ease your way.

636
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,320
Why?

637
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,960
Because you're not a wealthy man.

638
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,560
In exchange for what?

639
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,280
Information.

640
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,760
Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you'd feel...uncomfortable with.

641
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,520
- Just tell me what he's up to. - Why?

642
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,000
I worry about him. Constantly.

643
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,680
That's nice of you.

644
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,120
But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned,

645
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,360
we have what you might call a...difficult relationship.

646
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,680


647
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,680


648
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,680


649
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,200
- No. - But I haven't mentioned a figure.

650
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,920
Don't bother.

651
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,960
You're very loyal VERY quickly.

652
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,760
No, I'm not, I'm just not interested.

653
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,640
"Trust issues"...it says here.

654
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,520
What's that?

655
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Could it be that you've decided to trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?

656
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,860
Who says I trust him?

657
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,480
You don't seem the kind to make friends easily.

658
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,280
Are we done?

659
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,320
You tell me.

660
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,560
I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him,

661
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,760
but I can see from your left hand that's not going to happen.

662
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,360
- My what? - Show me.

663
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,280
Don't...

664
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,800
- Remarkable. - What is?

665
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,360
Most people...blunder round this city,

666
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,480
and all they see are streets and shops and cars.

667
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,290
When you walk with Sherlock Holmes,

668
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,320
you see the battlefield.

669
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,720
You've seen it already. Haven't you?

670
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,880
What's wrong with my hand?

671
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,480
You have an intermittent tremor in your left hand.

672
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,560
Your therapist thinks it's post-traumatic stress disorder.

673
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,480
She thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service.

674
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,000
Who the hell are you?

675
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,030
How do you know that?

676
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,280
Fire her. She's got it the wrong way round.

677
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,960
You're under stress right now and your hand is perfectly steady.

678
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,640
You're not haunted by the war, Dr Watson...

679
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,120
You miss it.

680
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,600
Welcome back.

681
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Time to choose a side, Dr Watson.

682
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,320
I'm to take you home.

683
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,320


684
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,320


685
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,200
Address?

686
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,360
Er, Baker Street.

687
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,080
221B Baker Street.

688
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,600
But I need to stop off somewhere first.

689
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,600
Listen, your boss.

690
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,080
Any chance you could not tell him this is where I went?

691
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,640
- Sure. - You've told him already, haven't you?

692
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,080
Yeah.

693
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,640
Hey erm...  do you ever get any free time?

694
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,920
Oh, yeah. Lots.

695
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,720
- Bye... - OK.

696
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,560
What are you doing?

697
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,160
Nicotine patch.

698
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,600
Helps me think.

699
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,360
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days.

700
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,120
Bad news for brain work.

701
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,640
It's good news for breathing.

702
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,160
Oh... Breathing! Breathing's boring.

703
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,960
Is that...three patches?

704
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,760
It's a three-patch problem.

705
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,120
Well...?

706
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,080
You asked me to come, I'm assuming it's important.

707
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,240
Oh - yeah, of course.  Can I borrow your phone?

708
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,240
My phone?

709
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,020
Always a chance that my number will be recognised.

710
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,120
It's on the website.

711
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,270
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.

712
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,080
Yeah, she's downstairs.

713
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,360
I tried shouting but she didn't hear.

714
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,200
I WAS the other side of London...

715
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,000
There was no hurry.

716
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,440
Here...

717
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,320
So what's this about - the case?

718
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,940
Her case... HER case?

719
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,760
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

720
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,240
The murderer took her suitcase, first big mistake.

721
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,880
OK, he took her case. So?

722
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,080
It's no use, there's no other way. We'll have to risk it.

723
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,600
On my desk there's a number. I want you to send a text.

724
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,560
You've brought me here...  to send a text.

725
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,080
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

726
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,880
- What's wrong? - Just met a friend of yours.

727
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,840
- A friend? - An enemy.

728
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,320
Oh. Which one?

729
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,130
Well, your arch-enemy, according to him.

730
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,520
Do people have arch-enemies?

731
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,240
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

732
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,120
- Yes. - Did you take it?

733
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,340
No.

734
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,120
Pity, we could have split the fee. Think it through next time.

735
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,710
Who is he?

736
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,440
The most dangerous man you've ever met, and not my problem right now.

737
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,080
On my desk, the number!

738
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,320
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

739
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,520
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

740
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,400
Yes. That's not important. Just enter the number.

741
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,970
- Are you doing it? - Yes.

742
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,750
- Have you done it? - Yeah - hang on!

743
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,920
These words exactly.

744
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,360
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

745
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,160
"I must have blacked out.

746
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,280
"22 Northumberland Street, please come."

747
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,840
You blacked out?

748
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,160
What? No... No!

749
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,920
Type and send it. Quickly.

750
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,000
- Have you sent it? - What's the address?

751
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,060
22 Northumberland Street.

752
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,960
Hurry up!

753
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,920
That's...

754
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,000
That's the pink lady's case,

755
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,880
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

756
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,240
Yes, obviously.

757
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,740
Oh, perhaps I should mention I didn't kill her.

758
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,960
I never said you did.

759
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,950
Why not?

760
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,220
Given that text and the fact I have her case

761
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,080
it's a perfectly logical assumption.

762
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,360
Do people usually assume you're the murderer?

763
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,000
Now and then, yes.

764
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,560
OK...

765
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,800
- How did you get this? - By looking.

766
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,210
Where?

767
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,640
The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens.

768
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,520
He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car.

769
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,320
Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention -

770
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,240
particularly a man, which is statistically more likely.

771
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,840
So obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it.

772
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,960
Wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake.

773
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,910
I checked every backstreet wide enough

774
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,640
for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens,

775
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,240
'and anywhere you could

776
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,200
dispose of a bulky object without being observed.

777
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,480
'Took me less than an hour to find the right skip.'

778
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,680
Pink. You got all that because you realised the case would be pink?

779
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,910
It had to be pink, obviously.

780
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,000
Why didn't I think of that?

781
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,600
Because you're an idiot.

782
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,280
No, no, no, don't look like that. Practically everyone is.

783
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,000
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

784
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,200
From the case? How could I?

785
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,960
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

786
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,480
There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case.

787
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,000
We know she had one. You just texted it.

788
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,320
Maybe she left it at home.

789
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,930
She has a string of lovers

790
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,540
and she's careful about it.

791
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,560
She never leaves her phone at home.

792
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,960
Why did I just send that text?

793
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,360
Well, the question is where is her phone NOW?

794
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,960
- She could have lost it. - Yes, or?

795
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,880
The murderer... You think the murderer has the phone?

796
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,930
Maybe she...left it when she left her case.

797
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,160
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.

798
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,600
Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.

799
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,230
Sorry...what are we doing -

800
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,160
Did I just text a murderer? What good will that do?

801
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,560


802
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,240
A few hours after his last victim,

803
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,640
and now he receives a text that can only be from her.

804
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,380
If somebody had just found that phone

805
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,670
they'd ignore a text like that,

806
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,320
but the murderer... would panic.

807
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,240
Have you talked to the police?

808
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,520
Four people are dead, there isn't time to talk to police.

809
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,240
So why are you talking to me?

810
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,000
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

811
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,160
So I'm basically filling in for your skull?

812
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,310
Relax, you're doing fine.

813
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,550
- Well? - Well, what?

814
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,720
Well - you could just sit there and...watch telly.

815
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,730
What, you want me to come with you?

816
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:47,400
I like company when I go out, and I think better when I talk aloud.

817
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,800
The skull just attracts attention, so...

818
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,240
- Problem? - Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

819
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,080
What about her?

820
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,160
She said...

821
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,400
you get off on this. You enjoy it.

822
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,000
And I said "dangerous", and here you are.

823
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,120
Damn it!

824
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,040
Where are we going?

825
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,520
Northumberland Street's, a five-minute walk from here.

826
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,770
You think he's stupid enough to go there?

827
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,080
No - I think he's brilliant enough.

828
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,040
I love the brilliant ones. They're all so desperate to get caught.

829
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,280
- Why? - Appreciation!

830
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,960
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

831
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,480
That's the frailty of genius, John,

832
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,680
- it needs an audience. - Yeah.

833
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,000
This is his hunting ground. Right here in the heart of the city.

834
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,440
Now that we know his victims were abducted,

835
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,360
that changes everything.

836
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,320
Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets,

837
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,360
crowded places, but nobody saw them go.

838
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,210
Think!

839
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,680
Who do we trust, even though we don't know them?

840
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,040
Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?

841
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,360
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

842
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,480
Don't know. Who?

843
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,440
- Haven't the faintest. - Hungry?

844
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,680
Thank you, Billy.

845
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,270
22 Northumberland Street.

846
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,570
Keep your eyes on it.

847
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,080
He's not just going to ring the doorbell. He'd need to be mad.

848
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,600
He has killed four people.

849
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,120
OK.

850
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,320
Sherlock!

851
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,880
Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free.

852
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,160
On the house, for you and for your date.

853
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,880
- Do you want to eat? - I'm not his date.

854
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,080
This man got me off a murder charge.

855
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,770
This is Angelo.

856
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,040
Three years ago I proved to Lestrade

857
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,960
at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder

858
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,680
that Angelo was elsewhere, house-breaking.

859
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,750
He cleared my name.

860
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,400
I cleared it a bit. Anything happening opposite?

861
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,600
Nothing.

862
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,420
But for this man, I'd have gone to prison.

863
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,400
You did go to prison.

864
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,120
I'll get a candle for the table. It's more romantic.

865
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,640
I'm not his date!

866
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,520
You may as well eat. We might have a long wait.

867
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,040
Thanks.

868
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,160
People don't have arch-enemies.

869
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,160
- I'm sorry? - In real life.

870
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,560
There are no arch-enemies in real life. Doesn't happen.

871
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,920
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

872
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,920
So who did I meet?

873
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,760
What do real people have, then, in their..."real lives"?

874
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,240
Friends?

875
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,480
People they know, people they like, people they don't like...

876
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,360
- Girlfriends, boyfriends. - Yes, well, as I was saying - dull.

877
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,710
You don't have a girlfriend, then.

878
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,040
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

879
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,080
Oh, right.

880
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,680
Do you have a...boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way.

881
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,760
I know it's fine.

882
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,600
- So you've got a boyfriend then. - No.

883
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,440
Right. OK.

884
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,640
You're unattached. Like me.

885
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,400
Fine. Good.

886
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,280
John, erm...

887
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,040
I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work,

888
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,170
and while I'm flattered, I'm really not looking for any...

889
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:20,120
No, I'm...not asking. No.

890
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,080
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

891
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,520
Good.

892
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,400
Thank you.

893
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,520
Look across the street. Taxi. It's stopped.

894
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,440
Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out.

895
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,760
Why a taxi?

896
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,070
Oh, that's clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?

897
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:43,480
That's him.

898
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,640
Don't stare.

899
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,680
- You're staring. - We can't both stare.

900
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,640
Sorry...

901
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,400
- I've got the cab number. - Good for you.

902
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,630
Right turn, one way, roadworks,

903
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,240
traffic lights, bus lane,

904
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,640
pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic lights.

905
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,400


906
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,040
Sorry.

907
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:32,400


908
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,440


909
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,680
Come on, John...

910
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,600
Come on, John. We're losing him!

911
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,800


912
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,080


913
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,120
This way.

914
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,320
No - This way!

915
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,120
Sorry...

916
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,360


917
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,820


918
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,080


919
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:51,920


920
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,960
Police! Open her up.

921
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,400


922
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,240
No...

923
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,440
Teeth, tan. What - Californian...?

924
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,240
LA, Santa Monica. Just arrived.

925
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,160
- How could you possibly know that? - The luggage.

926
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,460
Probably your first trip to London, right?

927
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,040
Going by your final destination and let the cabbie's taking you.

928
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,080
Sorry - are you guys the police?

929
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,440
Yeah. Everything all right?

930
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,320
Yeah.

931
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,400
Welcome to London.

932
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,480
Er, any problems - just let us know.

933
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,470
Basically just a cab that happened to slow down.

934
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,720
Basically.

935
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,760
- Not the murderer. - Not the murderer, no.

936
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,800
Wrong country, good alibi.

937
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,960
- As they go. - Hey, where did you get this?

938
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,200
- Detective Inspector Lestrade? - Yeah.

939
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,080
I pickpocket him when he's annoying.

940
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,600
You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat.

941
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,840
What?

942
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,360
Nothing, just..."Welcome to London".

943
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,960
- Got your breath back? - Ready when you are.

944
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,120
OK...

945
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,880
That was ridiculous.

946
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,400
That was the most ridiculous thing...I've ever done.

947
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,760
And you invaded Afghanistan.

948
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,680
That wasn't just me.

949
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,320
Why aren't we back at the restaurant?

950
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,560
They can keep an eye out.

951
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,560
It was a long shot anyway.

952
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,480
So what were we doing there?

953
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,040
Oh, just passing the time.

954
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,800
And proving a point.

955
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,360
- What point? - You.

956
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,400
Mrs Hudson! Dr. Watson will take the room upstairs.

957
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,880
Says who?

958
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,480
Says the man at the door.

959
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,360
Sherlock texted me. He said you forgot this.

960
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,560
Er, thank you.

961
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,760
Thank you.

962
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,800
Sherlock, what have you done?

963
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,920
- Mrs Hudson? - Upstairs.

964
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,760
What are you doing?

965
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,880
Well, I knew you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.

966
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,570
You can't just break into my flat.

967
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,080
You can't withhold evidence - and I didn't break in.

968
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,440
Well, what do you call this then?

969
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,870
It's a drugs bust.

970
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,120
Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

971
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,200
- Have you met him? - John...

972
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,880
I'm pretty sure you could search this flat all day,

973
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,110
you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational.

974
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,360
John, you probably want to shut up now.

975
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,680
But come on...

976
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,360
- No... - What?

977
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,400
- You? - Shut up! I'm not your sniffer dog.

978
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,640
No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

979
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,930
Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?

980
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,940
- Oh, I volunteered. - They all did.

981
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,270
They're not strictly speaking on the drug squad,

982
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,240
but they're very keen.

983
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,200
- Are these human eyes? - Put those back!

984
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,640
- They were in the microwave. - It's an experiment.

985
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,080
Keep looking, guys.

986
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,360
Or you could help us properly and I'll stand them down.

987
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,560
- This is childish. - Well, I'm dealing with a child.

988
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,730
Sherlock, this is our case.

989
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,280
I'm letting you in, but you do not go off on your own.

990
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,050
Clear?

991
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,680
What - so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?

992
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,590
It stops being pretend if we find anything.

993
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,080
I am clean!

994
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,920
Is your flat...? All of it?

995
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,560
Don't even smoke.

996
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,760
Neither do I.

997
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,920
So let's work together.

998
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,680
- We've found Rachel.  - Who is she?

999
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,320
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

1000
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,280
Her daughter?

1001
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,840
Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?

1002
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,780
Never mind that, we found the case.

1003
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,380
According to someone the murderer has the case,

1004
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,080
and we found it in the  hands of our favourite psychopath.

1005
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,280
I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.

1006
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,280


1007
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,960
You need to bring Rachel in and I need to question her.

1008
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,040
- She's dead.  - Excellent. How, when and why?

1009
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,960
Is there a connection? There has to be.

1010
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,080
Well, I doubt it, since she's been dead for 14 years.

1011
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,120
Technically she was never alive.

1012
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:13,240
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

1013
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,600
No, that's...

1014
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,480
...that's not right. How...

1015
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,400
Why would she do that? Why?

1016
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,750
Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments?

1017
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,560
Yup - sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

1018
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,600
She didn't think about her daughter.

1019
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,670
She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails.

1020
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,120
She was dying. It took effort, it would have hurt.

1021
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,620
You said that the victims all took the poison themselves,

1022
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,640
that he makes them take it -

1023
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,140
well, maybe he... I don't know, talks to them.

1024
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,720
Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.

1025
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,040
Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?

1026
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,200
Not good?

1027
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,320
Bit not good, yeah.

1028
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,610
If you were dying... If you'd been murdered -

1029
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:55,680
in your very last few seconds what would you say?

1030
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,560
- "Please, God, let me live."  - Use your imagination!

1031
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,080
I don't have to.

1032
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,270
Yeah, but if you were clever... really clever,

1033
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:05,600
Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers - she was clever.

1034
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,440
She's trying to tell us something.

1035
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,120
Isn't the doorbell working? Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

1036
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,810
I didn't order a taxi. Go away.

1037
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,640
Oh, dear. They're making such a mess. What are they looking for?

1038
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,360
It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

1039
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,480
But they're just for my hip. They're herbal soothers...

1040
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,600
Shut up, everybody! Don't speak, don't breathe. I'm trying to think.

1041
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,880
Anderson, face the other way. You're putting me off.

1042
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,440
- What? My face is...  - Everybody quiet and still.

1043
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,720
- Anderson, turn your back.  - Oh, for God's sake!

1044
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,400
Your back, now, please!

1045
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,400
- Come on, think. Quick!  - What about your taxi?

1046
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,640
Mrs Hudson!

1047
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,880
She was clever. Clever, yes!

1048
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,320
She's cleverer than you lot and she's  dead. Do you see, do you get it?

1049
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,920
She didn't lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted it on him.

1050
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,960
When she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death.

1051
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,720
She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.

1052
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,080
But how?

1053
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,960
What? What do you mean, how?

1054
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,560
Rachel!

1055
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,480
Don't you see? Rachel!

1056
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,280
Look at you lot. You're all so vacant.

1057
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,080
Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing.

1058
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,240
Rachel is not a name.

1059
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,140
Then what is it?

1060
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,120
John, on the luggage, there's a label.

1061
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,200
E-mail address.

1062
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,080
jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk
Er, jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk.

1063
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,380
She didn't have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone.

1064
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,380


1065
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,360
A smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

1066
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,000
So there was a website for her account.

1067
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,160
The username is her e-mail address - and all together, the password is?

1068
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,440
- Rachel.  -So we can read her e-mails. So what?

1069
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,440
Anderson, don't talk out loud. You lower the IQ of the whole street.

1070
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,240
We can do much more than that. It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

1071
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,890
Which means if you lose it you can locate it online.

1072
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,040
She's leading us directly to the man who killed her.

1073
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,160
- Unless he got rid of it.  - We know he didn't.

1074
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,790
Come on, come on. Quickly!

1075
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,680
Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

1076
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,360
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother?

1077
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,440
Get vehicles, get a helicopter. This phone battery won't last for ever.

1078
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,680
We'll just have a map reference, not a name.

1079
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,600
It's a start!

1080
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,120
- Sherlock...  - Narrows it down from just anyone in London.

1081
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,600
-It's the first proper lead that we've had.  - Sherlock...

1082
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,040
Where is it? Quickly, where?

1083
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,040
Here. It's... in 221 Baker Street.

1084
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,880
How can it be here?

1085
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,280
How?

1086
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,390
Maybe it was in the case when you brought it back

1087
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,390
and it... fell out somewhere.

1088
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,400
What, and I didn't notice it? Me - I didn't notice?

1089
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,200
Anyway, we texted him and he called back.

1090
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,240
Guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here,

1091
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,130
belonged to the victim...

1092
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,760
Who do we trust, even if we don't know them?

1093
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,760


1094
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,120
Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?

1095
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,120
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

1096
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,920


1097
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,120
- Sherlock, you ok?  - What...?

1098
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,360
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

1099
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,320
So, how can the phone be here?

1100
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,560
Don't know.

1101
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,640
- I'll try it again.  - Good idea.

1102
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,320
Where are you going?

1103
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,800
Fresh air, just popping outside for a moment. Won't be long.

1104
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,920
- You sure you're all right?  - I'm fine.

1105
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,800
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

1106
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,280
I didn't order a taxi.

1107
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,400
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

1108
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,280
You're the cabbie.

1109
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,200
The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.

1110
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,440
It was you. Not your passenger.

1111
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,600
See? No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

1112
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,600
It's like you're invisible.

1113
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,400
Just the back of an 'ead.

1114
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,080
Proper advantage for a serial killer.

1115
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,400
- Is this a confession?  - Oh, yeah.

1116
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,680
I'll tell you what else...

1117
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,720
if you call the coppers now, I won't run.

1118
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,520
I'll sit quiet and they can take me down, I promise.

1119
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,840
Why?

1120
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,800
- Cos you're not going to do that.  - Am I not?

1121
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,640
I didn't kill those four people, Mr. Holmes.

1122
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,800
I spoke to 'em...

1123
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,880
and they killed themselves.

1124
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,600
If you get the coppers now, I'll promise you one thing.

1125
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,320
I will never tell you what I said.

1126
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,120
No-one else will die, though, and I believe they call that a result.

1127
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,120
And you won't ever understand how those people died.

1128
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,480
What kind of result do you care about?

1129
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,240
If I wanted to understand...

1130
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,120
- ...what would I do?  - Let me take you for a ride.

1131
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,560
So you can kill me too?

1132
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,880
I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

1133
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,040
I'm going to talk to ya...

1134
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,680
..and then you're going to kill yourself.

1135
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,680
He just got in a cab... It's Sherlock. He just drove off in a cab.

1136
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,280
I told you, he does that.

1137
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,800
He bloody left again.

1138
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,520
We're wasting our time!

1139
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,920
I'm... calling the phone, it's ringing out.

1140
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,640
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

1141
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,560
- I'll try the search again. - Does it matter? Does any of it?

1142
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,160
He's just a lunatic, and he'll always let you down.

1143
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,360
And you're wasting your time. All our time.

1144
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,840
OK, everybody...

1145
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,360
done here.

1146
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,480
How did you find me?

1147
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,320
Oh, I recognised ya.

1148
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,880
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

1149
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,000
Sherlock Holmes!

1150
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,480
I was warned about you.

1151
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,360
I've been on your website, too. Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

1152
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,000
- Who warned you about me?  - Just someone out there who's noticed.

1153
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,200
Who?

1154
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,040
Who would notice me?

1155
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,240
- You're too modest, Mr Holmes.  - I'm really not.

1156
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,520
Got yourself a fan.

1157
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,200
Tell me more.

1158
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,880
That's all you're going to know.

1159
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,000
In THIS lifetime.

1160
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,520
Why did he do that? Why did he have to leave?

1161
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,880
You know him better than I do.

1162
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,120
I've known him for five years - and no, I don't.

1163
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,240
So why do you put up with him?

1164
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,200
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

1165
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,920
And because Sherlock Holmes is a great man -

1166
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,680
and I think one day, if we're very, very lucky,

1167
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,880
he might even be a good one.

1168
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,240
Where are we?

1169
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,020
You know every street in London.

1170
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,600
You know exactly where we are.

1171
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,600
Roland-Kerr Further Education College

1172
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,080
Why here?

1173
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,560
It's open.

1174
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,440
Cleaners are in.

1175
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,070
One thing about being a cabbie -

1176
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,640
you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder.

1177
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,720
I'm surprised more of us don't branch out.

1178
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,680
And you just walk your victims in?  How?

1179
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,320
Oh... Dull.

1180
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,880
Don't worry. It gets better.

1181
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,530
You can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint.

1182
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,240
I don't.

1183
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,040
It's much better than that.

1184
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,770
Don't need this with you.

1185
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:21,120
Cos you'll follow me.

1186
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,040
Well, what do you think?

1187
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,240
It's up to you.

1188
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,080
You're the one who's going to die here.

1189
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,160
No, I'm not.

1190
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,040
That's what they all say.

1191
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,760
Shall we talk?

1192
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,040
Bit risky, wasn't it?

1193
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,080
Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen.

1194
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,400
They're not that stupid.

1195
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,600
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

1196
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,560
You call that a risk? Nah...

1197
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,600
This is a risk.

1198
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,960
Oh, I like this bit.

1199
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,800
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

1200
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,840
But you're about to.

1201
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,520
I just have to do this...

1202
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,320
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

1203
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,040
Oh, you're going to love this.

1204
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,110
Love what?

1205
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:31,720
Sherlock Holmes! Look at you!

1206
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,600
Here in the flesh.

1207
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,240
That website of yours, your fan told me about it.

1208
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,920
My fan?

1209
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,520
You are brilliant.

1210
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,920
You are a proper genius.

1211
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,940
The Science of Deduction.

1212
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:51,000
Now, that... is proper thinking.

1213
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,200
Between you and me sitting here, why can't people think?

1214
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,160
Don't it make you mad?

1215
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,920
Why can't people just think?

1216
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,320
Oh, I see...  So you're a proper genius too.

1217
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,520
Don't look it, do I?

1218
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,600
Funny little man driving a cab.

1219
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,840
But you'll know better in a minute.

1220
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,840
Chances are it'll be the last thing you ever know.

1221
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,220
OK, two bottles. Explain.

1222
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,520
There's a good bottle and a bad bottle.

1223
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,120
You take the pill from the good bottle, you live.

1224
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:36,280
You take the pill from  the bad bottle...you die.

1225
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,260
Both bottles are of course identical.

1226
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:38,920
In every way.

1227
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,400
And you know which is which.

1228
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,280
Of course I know.

1229
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,880
But I don't.

1230
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,720
Wouldn't be a game if you knew.  You're the one who chooses.

1231
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,360
Why should I? I've got nothing to go on.

1232
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,720
What's in it for me?

1233
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,520
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

1234
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,720
Whatever bottle you choose,

1235
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,400
I take the pill from the other one.

1236
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,840
And then together...

1237
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,320
we take our medicine.

1238
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,400
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

1239
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,800
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

1240
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,120
Didn't expect that,  did you, Mr Holmes?

1241
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,680
This is what you did to the rest of them -

1242
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,830
you gave them a choice?

1243
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:20,080
And now I'm giving you one.

1244
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,640
You take your time.

1245
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,520
Get yourself together.

1246
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,830
I want your best game.

1247
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:29,480
It's not a game, it's chance.

1248
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,200
I've played four times. I'm alive.

1249
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,080
It's not chance, Mr Holmes, it's chess.

1250
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,680
It's a game of chess,

1251
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,360
with one move...and one survivor.

1252
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,200
And this - this...

1253
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,960
is the move.

1254
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,600
Did I just give you the good bottle  or the bad bottle?

1255
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,840
You can choose either one.

1256
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,360
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade -  I need to speak to him.

1257
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,120
It's important. It's an emergency.

1258
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,400
Er, left here, please. Left here...

1259
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,480
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

1260
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,690
Ready to play?

1261
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:31,280
Play what?  It's a 50:50 chance.

1262
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,920
You're not playing the numbers, you're playing me.

1263
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,000
Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill?

1264
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,120
Is it a bluff,

1265
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,200
or a double bluff?

1266
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,180
Or a triple bluff?

1267
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:45,320
It's still just chance.

1268
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,320
Four people, in a row?  It's not chance.

1269
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,000
- Luck. - It's genius!

1270
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,200
I know how people think.

1271
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,160
I know how people think I think.

1272
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,600
I can see it all like a map inside my head.

1273
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,920
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

1274
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,600
Or maybe God just loves me.

1275
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,800
Either way,  you're wasted as a cabbie.

1276
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,040
So...

1277
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:26,120
You risked your life four times just to kill strangers? Why?

1278
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,680
Time to play.

1279
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,200
Oh, I am playing.

1280
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,400
This is my turn.

1281
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,920
There's shaving foam behind your left  ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1282
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,720
Traces of where it's happened before,

1283
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,680
so obviously you live on your own - there's no-one to tell you.

1284
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,140
But there's a photograph of children.

1285
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:44,600
Their mother's been cut out of the picture.

1286
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,320
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

1287
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,280
The photograph's old,  but the frame's new.

1288
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,680
You think of your children,  but you don't get to see them.

1289
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,000
Estranged father.

1290
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,920
She took the kids,

1291
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,360
but you still love them and it still hurts.

1292
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,640
Ah, but there's more.

1293
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,680
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

1294
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,400
but everything you're wearing  is at least...three years old?

1295
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:11,320
Keeping up appearances, but not planning ahead.

1296
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,320
And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What's that about?

1297
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,840
Three years ago. Is that when they told you?

1298
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,900
Told me what?

1299
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:26,910


1300
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,760
That you're a dead man walking.

1301
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,280
So are you.

1302
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,920
You don't have long, though.

1303
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,040
Am I right?

1304
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,400
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

1305
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,280
Any breath could be my last.

1306
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,760
And because you're dying, you've just murdered four people.

1307
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,640
I've outlived four people.

1308
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,040
That's the most fun you can have with an aneurism.

1309
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,760
No... No, there's something else.

1310
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,520
You didn't just kill four people  because you're bitter.

1311
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,760
Bitterness is a paralytic.

1312
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:04,760
Love is a much more vicious motivator.

1313
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,400
Somehow, this is about your children.

1314
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,280
- You are good, in't ya? - But how?

1315
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,520
When I die they won't get much,  my kids.

1316
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,880
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

1317
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,090
Or serial killing.

1318
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:26,240
You'd be surprised.

1319
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:27,880
Surprise me.

1320
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,640
I have a sponsor.

1321
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,790
You have a what?

1322
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:36,920
For every life I take, money goes to my kids.

1323
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,360
The more I kill...  the better off they'll be.

1324
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:44,440
You see? It's nicer than you think.

1325
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,400
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1326
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,040
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

1327
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,440
You're not the only one to enjoy a good murder.

1328
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,000
There's others out there just like you,

1329
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,600
except you're just a man.

1330
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,200
And they're so much more than that.

1331
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,760
What do you mean...

1332
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,800
more than a man?

1333
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,920
An organisation...? What?

1334
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,160
There's a name, that no-one says.

1335
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,960
And I'm not going to say it either.

1336
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,760
Now, enough chatter.

1337
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,480
Time to choose.

1338
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,760
Sherlock?!

1339
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,920
Sherlock!

1340
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,360
What if I don't choose either?  I could just walk out of here.

1341
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,360
You can take a 50:50 chance,

1342
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,320
or I can shoot you in the head.

1343
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,320
Funnily enough,

1344
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,320
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1345
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,360
I'll have the gun, please.

1346
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,040
Are you sure?

1347
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,720
Definitely.

1348
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,840
The gun.

1349
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,880
You don't want to phone a friend?

1350
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,240
The gun.

1351
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,920
I know a real gun when I see one.

1352
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,120
- None of the others did. - Clearly.

1353
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:24,560
Well, this has been very interesting.

1354
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,040
I look forward to the court case.

1355
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,920
Just before you go, did you figure it out?

1356
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,480
Which one's the good bottle?

1357
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,640
Course. Child's play.

1358
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,920
Well, which one, then?

1359
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,880
Which one would you have picked?

1360
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,000
Just so I know whether I could have beaten you.

1361
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,080
Come on!

1362
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,880
Play the game.

1363
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,240
Interesting.

1364
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,040
So what do you think?

1365
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,080
Shall we?

1366
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,920
Really... What do you think?

1367
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,760
Can you beat me?

1368
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,040
Are you clever enough...

1369
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,920
..to bet your life?

1370
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,920
Sherlock

1371
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,560
I bet you get bored, don't you?

1372
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,480
I know you do.

1373
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,200
A man like you. So clever.

1374
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,600
But what's the point of being clever if you can't prove it?

1375
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,400
Still the addict.

1376
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,720
But this...this is what you're really addicted to.

1377
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,120
You'll do anything...

1378
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,320
..anything at all, to stop being bored.

1379
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,080
You're not bored now, are ya?

1380
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,400
Isn't it good?

1381
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,160
Was I right?

1382
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,000
I was, wasn't I?

1383
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,400
Did I get it right?!

1384
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,120
OK... Tell me this.

1385
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,960
Your sponsor. Who was it?

1386
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,040
The one who told you about me, my fan.

1387
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,880
I want a name.

1388
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,400
No...

1389
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,880
You're dying,

1390
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,520
but there's still time to hurt you.

1391
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,160
Give me...a name.

1392
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,640
A name! Now.

1393
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:20,920
The name!

1394
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,920
Moriaty.

1395
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,170
Why have I got this blanket?

1396
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:49,240
They keep putting this blanket on me.

1397
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,960
- Yeah, it's for shock.  - I'm not in shock.

1398
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,640
Yeah, but some of the guys  want to take photographs.

1399
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,040
So, the shooter. No sign?

1400
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,020
Cleared off before we got here.

1401
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,160
But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose.

1402
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,360
One of them could have been following him, but...

1403
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,440
we've got nothing to go on.

1404
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,040
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1405
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,200
OK. Give me.

1406
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,200
The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun.

1407
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,350
A kill shot over that distance with that kind of weapon,

1408
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:18,760
that's a crack shot.  But not just a marksman, a fighter.

1409
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:22,400
His hands couldn't have shaken at all  so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.

1410
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,280
He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger though, so strong moral principle.

1411
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,360
You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service, and...

1412
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,640
nerves of steel...

1413
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,270
Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.

1414
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:41,680
- Sorry? - Ignore all of that.

1415
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,400
It's just the er...the shock talking.

1416
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,280
- Where are you going? - I just need to...talk about the rent.

1417
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,320
- I've still got questions. - What now? I'm in shock.

1418
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,680
Look, I've got a blanket.

1419
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:54,730
- Sherlock! - And, I just caught you a serial killer...

1420
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:55,920
More or less.

1421
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,920
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow,  off you go.

1422
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,200
Erm, Sergeant Donovan has...just been explaining everything.

1423
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,240
The two pills...

1424
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,240
dreadful business, isn't it?  Dreadful.

1425
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,440
Good shot.

1426
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,080
Yes. Yes, must have been. Through that window.

1427
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:24,720
Well, you'd know.

1428
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,200
Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers.

1429
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,630
I don't suppose you'd serve time for this,

1430
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,320
but let's avoid the court case.

1431
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,080
- Are you all right? - Yes, of course I'm all right.

1432
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,760
- Well, you have just killed a man.  - Yes...

1433
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,840
That's true, isn't it?

1434
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,120
But he wasn't a very nice man.

1435
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,910
No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?

1436
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:51,560
Frankly a bloody awful cabbie.

1437
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,520
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.

1438
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,280
You should have seen the route he took us to get here.

1439
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,000
Stop it! We can't giggle,  it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1440
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,480
- Well, you're the one who shot him.  - Keep your voice down.

1441
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,040
- Sorry, it's just erm...  nerves, I think. - Sorry.

1442
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,490
You were going to take that damn pill, weren't you?

1443
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:10,360
Course I wasn't.

1444
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,360
Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.

1445
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,000
No, you didn't.

1446
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,330
That's how you get your kicks,  isn't it -

1447
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,720
You risk your life to prove you're clever.

1448
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,680
- Why would I do that?  - Because you're an idiot.

1449
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,840
- Dinner? - Starving.

1450
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,930
End of Baker Street there's a good Chinese.

1451
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:28,600
Stays open till two.

1452
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,880
You can tell a good Chinese by

1453
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,160
the bottom third of the door handle.

1454
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:35,120
Sherlock... That's him, that's  the man I was talking to you about.

1455
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,720
I know exactly who that is.

1456
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,320
So... Another case cracked.

1457
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,840
How very public-spirited.

1458
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,160
Though that's never really your motivation, is it?

1459
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,840
What are you doing here?

1460
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,400
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1461
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,800
Yes, I've been hearing about your "concern".

1462
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,560
Always so aggressive.

1463
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,440
Did it never occur to you that  you and I belong on the same side?

1464
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,520
Oddly enough - no.

1465
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,600
We have more in common than you'd like to believe.

1466
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,720
This petty feud between us is simply childish.

1467
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,770
People will suffer.

1468
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,480
And you know how it always upset Mummy.

1469
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,280
I upset her?

1470
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,640
Me?

1471
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,960
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

1472
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,360
No. No, wait...

1473
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,760
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

1474
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,200
Mother. Our mother.

1475
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,880
This is my brother, Mycroft.

1476
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,840
Putting on weight again?

1477
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,280
- Losing it, in fact.  - He's your brother?

1478
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,160
Course he's my brother.

1479
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,720
- So he's not... - not what?

1480
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,640
I don't know... Criminal mastermind?

1481
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,960
- Close enough. - For goodness' sake.

1482
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,280
I occupy a minor position in the British government.

1483
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,370
He is the British government,

1484
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:46,230
when he's not too busy being

1485
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,800
the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis.

1486
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,270
Good evening, Mycroft.

1487
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,400
Try not to start a war before I get home,

1488
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,040
you know what it does for the traffic.

1489
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,320
So, when you say you're concerned about him - you actually are concerned?

1490
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,840
Yes, of course.

1491
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,960
I mean, it actually is a childish feud?

1492
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,920
He's always been so resentful.

1493
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,560
You can imagine  the Christmas dinners. Yeah...

1494
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,600
No... God, no.

1495
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,520
I'd better erm...

1496
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,680
Hello again.

1497
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,920
- Hello.  - We met earlier on this evening.

1498
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,960
- Oh! - OK. Goodnight.

1499
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,600
Goodnight, Dr Watson.

1500
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,200
So, dim sum. Mmm!

1501
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,720
- I can always predict the fortune cookies. - No, you can't.

1502
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,760
Almost can. You did get shot, though.

1503
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,580
Sorry?

1504
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,120
In Afghanistan.  There was an actual wound.

1505
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,520
- Oh. Yeah, shoulder.  - Shoulder! I thought so.

1506
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,050
- No, you didn't. - The left one.

1507
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:42,840
- Lucky guess. - I never guess.

1508
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,400
Yes, you do.

1509
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,040
- What are you so happy about?  - Moriarty.

1510
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,200
- What's Moriarty?  - I've absolutely no idea.

1511
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,480
Sir, shall we go?

1512
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,280
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

1513
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,040
He could be the making of my brother...

1514
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,680
or make him worse than ever.

1515
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,680
Either way, we'd better upgrade their surveillance status.

1516
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,080
Grade three active.

1517
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,080
Sorry, Sir - whose status?

1518
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:15,440
Sherlock Holmes, and Dr Watson.
