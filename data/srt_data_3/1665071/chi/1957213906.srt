197
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,630
就两分钟  行吧
Two minutes, all right?

198
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,850
18岁青年   在体育中心内自杀

199
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,350
她还在跳舞吗
She still dancing?

200
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,150
对  要是这也算跳舞
Yeah, if you can call it that.

201
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,270
- 拿了她的车钥匙吗  - 从她包里拿了
- Did you get the car keys off her? - Got them out of her bag.

202
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,950
她在哪儿？
Where is she?

203
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,590
交通次大臣贝丝·达文波的尸体
The body of Beth Davenport, Junior Minister for Transport,

204
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,830
于昨天后半夜  在大伦敦一座建筑工地被发现
was found late last night on a building site in Greater London.

205
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,470
初步调查显示为自杀
Preliminary investigations suggest that this was suicide.

206
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,390
我们可以确认  这起明显的自杀案件相当近似于
We can confirm that this apparent suicide closely resembles those

207
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,190
杰弗里·帕特森爵士和詹姆斯·菲利莫的案子
of SirJeffrey Patterson and James Phillimore.

208
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,770
有鉴于此，这些事件现在被认为存在关联
In the light of this, these incidents are now being treated as linked.

209
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,210
调查已经展开
The investigation is ongoing,

210
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,300
不过雷斯垂德探长会在现在回答问题
but Detective Inspector Lestrade will take questions now.

211
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,500
探长，自杀怎么会有关联？
Detective Inspector, how can suicides be linked?

212
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,350
这个嘛，他们都服了相同的毒药
Well, they all took the same poison.

213
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,470
他们都被发现于没有理由出现的地方
They were all found in places they had no reason to be.

214
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,790
他们中没人出现过先期征兆
None of them had shown any prior indication.

215
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,760
但是你不能连环自杀啊
But you can't have serial suicides.

216
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,140
显然是可以的
Well, apparently you can.

217
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,490
这三个人，他们没有什么关联吗？
These three people, there's nothing that links them?

218
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,910
我们还没有发现关联，但是
There's no link we've found yet, but

219
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,750
我们还在寻找 肯定有关联
we're looking for it - there has to be one.

220
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,470
要是你们都收到短信，请无视它
If you've all got texts, please ignore them.

221
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,430
上面就写着“错了”
It just says "Wrong".

222
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,900
对，不过无视就好
Yeah. Well, just ignore that.

223
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,870
要是没有其它问题给雷斯垂德探长
If there are no more questions for Detective Inspector Lestrade,

224
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,610
这次记者招待会就到此为止
I'm going to bring this session to an end.

225
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,190
如果这是自杀案件  你们又在调查什么
If they're suicides, what are you investigating?

226
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,000
如我所说  这些自杀案件显然有所关联
As I say, these suicides are clearly linked.

227
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,990
这是一次不同寻常的情况
It's an unusual situation.

228
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,270
我们已有最好的人员在调查
We've got our best people investigating.

229
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
又是"错了"
Says "Wrong" Again.

230
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,390
再回答一个问题
One more question.

231
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,380
有没有一点可能性这是谋杀呢？
Is there any chance that these are murders?

232
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,700
如果是的话  会不会是连环杀手？
And if they are, is this the work of a serial killer?

233
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,640
我…我知道你们喜欢写这些
I know that you like writing about these,

234
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,710
但这些确实显示为自杀
but these do appear to be suicides.

235
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,810
我们知道区别，毒药显然是自己吞下的
We know the difference. The poison was clearly self-administered.

236
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,120
对，但如果他们是被谋杀，大家怎么才能保障自己安全
Yes, but if they are murders, how do people keep themselves safe?

237
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,130
哦，不要去自杀
Well, don't commit suicide.

238
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,830
《每日邮报》
DailyMail.

239
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,730
显然，这对大家来说是恐慌时刻
Obviously, this is a frightening time for people,

240
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,750
但大家要做的，就是采取合理的预防措施
but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions.

241
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,710
我们就都能如愿保障安全
We are all as safe as we want to be.

242
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,670
谢谢
Thank you.

243
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,020
你必须阻止他这么胡闹
You've got to stop him doing that.

244
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,710
他搞得我们像傻瓜
He's making us look like idiots.

245
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,390
要是你告诉我他怎么办到的 我会阻止他
If you can tell me how he does it, I'll stop him.

246
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,350
约翰
John!

247
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,710
约翰·华生
John Watson!

248
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,650
斯坦福，迈克·斯坦福，我们以前在巴茨医院共事
Stamford, Mike Stamford. We were at Barts together.

249
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,750
对，抱歉，迈克，你好
Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.

250
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,330
- 没事，我理解，我胖了，  - 没有
- Yeah, I know, I got fat. - No, no.

251
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,070
我听说你到国外什么地方挨枪子儿去了，怎么回事？
I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at. What happened?

252
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,700
我中了枪
I got shot.

253
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,010
那你还在巴茨医院吗
Are you still at Barts, then?

254
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,980
现在教书  阳光小青年，跟我们以前一样
Teaching now, yeah. Bright young things like we used to be.

255
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,830
老天  我讨厌他们
God, I hate them.

256
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,650
你呢？工作安顿之前，先住在城里吗？
What about you? Just staying in town till you get yourself sorted?

257
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,570
靠军队退休金没法在伦敦过日子
I can't afford London on an Army pension.

258
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,690
你就是住其它地方也不行
You couldn't bear to be anywhere else.

259
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,980
那不是我认识的约翰·华生
That's not the John Watson I know.

260
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,670
对，我不是那个约翰·华生了
Yeah, I'm not the John Watson...

261
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,210
海瑞没帮上忙吗
Couldn't Harry help?

262
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,230
切，好像还有指望似的
Yeah, like that's going to happen

263
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,590
我不知道，找人合租之类呢？
I don't know, get a flatshare or something?

264
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,320
得了，谁愿意当我的室友？
Come on, who'd want me for a flatmate?

265
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,490
怎么了
What?

266
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,520
你是今天第二个跟我说这话的人
You're the second person to say that to me today.

267
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,270
第一个是谁？
Who was the first?

268
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,830
有多新鲜
How fresh?

269
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,630
刚刚送来  67岁  自然死亡
Just in. 67, natural causes.

270
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,830
以前在这工作，我认识他，人很好
Used to work here. I knew him, he was nice.

271
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,990
好
Fine.

272
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,270
我们先从短马鞭开始
We'll start with the riding crop.

273
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,870
今天不太顺，是吧
So, bad day, was it?

274
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,910
我要知道20分钟后的瘀伤形状
I need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes.

275
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
一个人的不在场证明就靠它了  发短信给我
A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

276
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,650
那个，我想问一下，也许等你工作完后…
Listen, I was wondering. Maybe later, when you're finished...

277
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,650
你涂了唇膏，你刚才没涂唇膏啊
You're wearing lipstick. You weren't wearing lipstick before.

278
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,430
我...我稍微润色了一下
I, er... I refreshed it a bit.

279
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,110
不好意思，你刚才是说？
Sorry, you were saying?

280
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,790
我是想问 你想喝咖啡吗
I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee.

281
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,590
清咖啡，两块糖，麻烦了，我就在楼上
Black, two sugars, please. I'll be upstairs.

282
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,110
好吧
Ok.

283
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,150
- 跟我那会儿有点不一样了  - 你都想不到
- Bit different from my day. - You've no idea!

284
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,600
迈克，能否借用你的电话，我的没信号
Mike, can I borrow your phone? There's no signal on mine.

285
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,500
- 固定电话有问题吗  - 我更喜欢发短信
- And what's wrong with the landline? - I prefer to text.

286
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,550
抱歉，在我大衣里
Sorry, it's in my coat.

287
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,270
哦，给，用我的吧
Er, here...use mine.

288
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,670
哦，谢谢
Oh, thank you.

289
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,510
这是我的一个老朋友，约翰·华生
This is an old friend of mine, John Watson.

290
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,310
阿富汗还是伊拉克？
Afghanistan or Iraq?

291
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,510
- 什么？  - 哪一个，阿富汗还是伊拉克？
- Sorry? - Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

292
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,350
阿富汗，不好意思，你怎么…
Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you...?

293
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,870
啊茉莉，咖啡，谢谢你
Ah, Molly, coffee, thank you.

294
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,430
你的唇膏怎么没了
What happened to the lipstick?

295
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,380
我用着没效果
It wasn't working for me.

296
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,020
真的？我倒觉得很有改善
Really? I thought it was a big improvement.

297
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,470
你的嘴现在看着太小
Your mouth's too small now.

298
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,110
好吧
Ok.

299
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,750
你对小提琴有何看法？
How do you feel about the violin?

300
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,100
抱歉，什么？
I'm sorry, what?

301
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,550
我在思考问题时会拉小提琴
I play the violin when I'm thinking

302
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,950
有时我会一连几天不说话
and sometimes I don't talk for days on end.

303
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,600
会让你心烦吗？
Would that bother you?

304
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,710
未来的室友应该彼此了解最坏的一面
Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.

305
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,540
- 你…你和他说起过我吗  - 一个字也没有
- You told him about me? - Not a word.

306
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,330
那谁说过室友的事了？
Then who said anything about flatmates?

307
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,590
我说过，早上告诉迈克，我这人肯定很难找到室友
I did. Told Mike this morning I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.

308
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,630
现在他来了，刚过午餐
Now here he is, just after lunch,

309
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,550
带来一个老友，显然刚在阿富汗服完兵役回家
with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan.

310
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,810
这不难推论
Wasn't a difficult leap.

311
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,110
你怎么知道阿富汗的事
How did you know about Afghanistan?

312
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,350
我看中一处不错的小地方 在伦敦市中心
Got my eye on a nice little place in central London.

313
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,030
我们应该有能力负担
We ought to be able to afford it.

314
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,070
我们明天晚上在那里见，七点
We'll meet there tomorrow evening, seven o'clock.

315
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,190
抱歉  赶时间
Sorry, got to dash.

316
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,960
我想我把短马鞭忘在停尸间了
I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.

317
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,590
就这样吗？
Is that it?

318
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,510
什么就这样？
Is that what?

319
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,800
我们才刚见面  就要一起去看房了吗
We've only just met and we're going to go and look at a flat?

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,590
有问题吗
Problem?

321
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,730
我们一点也不了解对方
We don't know a thing about each other.

322
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,600
我不知道我们去哪里见
I don't know where we're meeting.

323
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,840
我甚至不知道你的名字
I don't even know your name.

324
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,920
我知道你是个军医
I know you're an Army doctor

325
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,630
刚从阿富汗因伤退役回来
and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan.

326
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,160
我知道你有个兄弟担心你
I know you've got a brother worried about you,

327
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,350
但你不向他求助
but you won't go to him for help

328
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,450
因为你看不惯他
because you don't approve of him,

329
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,990
可能因为他是酒鬼
possibly because he's an alcoholic,

330
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,390
更可能是因为他最近抛弃了自己的妻子
more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.

331
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,780
而且我知道  你的咨询师认为…
And I know your therapist thinks

332
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,990
你的跛腿是心理疾病，相当准确，我觉得
your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid.

333
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,550
这样应该可以继续下去了吧，你觉得呢？
That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?

334
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,200
名字是夏洛克·福尔摩斯
The name's Sherlock Holmes,

335
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,810
那地址是贝克街221B
and the address is 221 B Baker Street.

336
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,080
午安
Afternoon.

337
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,950
对，他总这样
Ya, he's always like that.

338
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,110
你好
Hello.

339
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,230
- 福尔摩斯先生  - 叫夏洛克就好
- Ah, Mr Holmes. - Sherlock, please.

340
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,470
这儿是主城区，肯定很贵吧
Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive.

341
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,470
哈德森太太，就是房东，给我特惠价
Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she's given me a special deal.

342
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,750
欠我个人情，几年前
Owes me a favour. A few years back,

343
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,890
她丈夫在弗罗里达被判死刑
her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida.

344
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,550
我帮了一下
I was able to help out.

345
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,190
抱歉，你阻止了她丈夫受刑？
Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed?

346
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,790
不，我确保了行刑
Oh, no, I ensured it.

347
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,350
夏洛克
Sherlock!

348
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,950
哈德森太太  这位是约翰·华生医生
Mrs Hudson, DrJohn Watson.

349
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,950
- 你好 请进吧   - 谢谢
- Hello. Come in. - Thank you.

350
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,030
我们走吧
Shall we...?

351
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,670
可以弄得很好
Well, this could be very nice.

352
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,990
的确很好
Very nice indeed.

353
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,430
是的
Yes.

354
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,830
是的，我也这么想，我的想法一样
Yes, I think so, my thoughts precisely.

355
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,830
- 所以我就直接搬进来了 - 只要清掉这些垃圾
-So I went straight ahead and moved in.-Soon as we get this rubbish cleaned up.

356
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,950
- 那这都是...  - 哦，显然我可以收拾下
-So this is all... -Well, obviously I can straighten things up

357
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,050
稍微的
a bit.

358
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,030
- 那是颗骷髅  - 我的一个朋友
- That's a skull. - Friend of mine.

359
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,670
我说朋友...
When I say friend...

360
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,310
你觉得如何，华生医生？
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

361
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,790
楼上还有间卧室，如果你们需要两间卧室的话
There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

362
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,710
我们当然需要两间
Of course we'll be needing two.

363
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,140
哦，别担心，这里各种人都有
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here.

364
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,670
隔壁特纳太太家有一对结婚了的
Mrs Turner next door's got married ones.

365
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,310
夏洛克  看你弄这么乱
Oh...Sherlock! The mess you've made.

366
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,900
昨晚我在网上搜了下你
I looked you up on the internet last night.

367
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,400
有什么有意思的吗？
Anything interesting?

368
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,300
找到了你的网站  "演绎学"
Found your website. The Science Of Deduction.

369
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,700
你怎么想？
What did you think?

370
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,590
你说你能通过领带识别一名软件工程师
You said you could identify a software designer by his tie

371
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,390
通过左手大拇指识别民航飞行员
and an airline pilot by his left thumb?

372
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,630
是的
Yes.

373
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,270
我还能通过你的脸和腿  看出你的军人职业
And I can read your military career in your face and your leg,

374
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,350
通过你的手机  知道你哥的饮酒习惯
and your brother's drinking habits in your mobile phone.

375
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,950
怎么办到的？
How?

376
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,150
这些自杀案怎么样，夏洛克？
What about these suicides, then, Sherlock?

377
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,550
我觉得这正是你拿手的
I thought that'd be right up your street.

378
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,900
三起完全一样
Three exactly the same.

379
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,390
四起
Four.

380
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,890
有第四起了，而且这次有些不同
There's been a fourth. And there's something different this time.

381
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,050
第四起？
A fourth?

382
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,510
- 哪里？  - 布里克斯顿的劳瑞斯顿花园
- Where? - Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

383
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,350
这次有什么新情况？不然你不会来找我
What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to me if there wasn't something differente.

384
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,130
- 你知道他们从未有留言吧？  - 对
- You know how they never leave notes? - Yes.

385
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,030
这次有
This one did.

386
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,380
你来吗？
Will you come?

387
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,310
- 谁是法医？  - 安德森
- Who's on forensics? - Anderson.

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,590
他跟我合不来
He doesn't work well with me.

389
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,190
- 他又不会当你助手  - 我需要一个助手
- Well, he won't be your assistant. - I need an assistant.

390
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,910
- 你来吗？  - 不坐警车，我就跟在后面
- Will you come? - Not in a police car, I'll be right behind.

391
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,710
谢谢
Thank you.

392
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,350
太棒了！耶！
Brilliant! Yes!

393
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,580
四起连环自杀案件  现在还有留言
Four serial suicides and now a note.

394
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,140
哦，过圣诞了
Oh, it's Christmas.

395
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,630
哈德森太太  我会晚归  可能需要点吃的
Mrs Hudson, I'll be late. Might need some food.

396
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,430
我是你房东，亲爱的，不是管家
I'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper.

397
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,990
冷的食物就行，约翰
Something cold will do. John,

398
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,030
来杯茶，跟在家里一样
have a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

399
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,790
不用等我
Don't wait up!

400
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,270
看看他，劲头十足...
Look at him, dashing about...

401
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,750
我丈夫以前也一样
My husband was just the same.

402
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,470
但你更属于坐得住的类型，我看得出来
But you're more the sitting-down type, I can tell.

403
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,510
我来帮你沏茶  你歇歇腿
I'll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg.

404
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,510
该死的腿！抱歉，我非常抱歉
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry.

405
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,030
只是有时这该死的东西…
It's just sometimes this bloody thing...

406
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,830
我理解，亲爱的，我臀部也是
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

407
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,510
来杯茶就太好了，谢谢
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.

408
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,910
就这一次，亲爱的  我不是你管家
Just this once, dear, I'm not your housekeeper.

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,400
- 再来几片饼干，如果有的话   - 不是你管家哦
- Couple of biscuits too, if you've got 'em. - Not your housekeeper!

410
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,870
你是个医生
You're a doctor.

411
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,590
实际上，你是一名军医
In fact, you're an Army doctor.

412
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,070
是的
Yes.

413
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,430
做得好吗？
Any good?

414
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,560
非常好
Very good.

415
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,230
见过无数创伤，是吧，致命的伤
Seen a lot of injuries, then. Violent deaths.

416
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,230
呃，是啊
Well, yes.

417
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,830
有点困扰，我打赌？
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

418
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,150
当然，是的，这辈子看够了，太多了
Of course. Yes. Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

419
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,000
- 还想看更多吗  - 哦，老天，当然
- Want to see some more? - Oh, God, yes.

420
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,960
抱歉，哈德森太太，不喝茶了  要出去
Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea. Off out.

421
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,000
你俩都去？
Both of you?

422
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,330
不可能的自杀案件？四起？
Impossible suicides? Four of them?

423
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,230
没理由坐在家里，终于有好玩的了
No point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on!

424
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,930
- 看看你，满心欢喜，这不得体  - 管他得不得体
- Look at you, all happy. It's not decent. - Who cares about decent?

425
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,270
游戏，哈德森太太，开始了
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

426
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,430
出租车
Taxi!

427
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,660
好吧，你有一些问题…
OK, you've got questions...

428
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,510
对，我们要去哪儿？
Yeah, where are we going?

429
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,000
犯罪现场，下一个？
Crime scene. Next?

430
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,270
- 你是谁？做什么的？  - 你觉得呢？
- Who are you? What do you do? - What do you think?

431
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,000
- 我本想说...私家侦探  - 但是...
- I'd say...private detective. - But...?

432
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,830
但警察不会找私家侦探
But the police don't go to private detectives.

433
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,350
我是个“咨询侦探”
I'm a consulting detective.

434
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,690
全世界独此一家，我发明的职业
Only one in the world. I invented the job.

435
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,710
那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

436
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,480
意思是警察束手无策时 这是常有的
It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always,

437
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,480
他们就咨询我
they consult me.

438
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,730
警察不会咨询业余人员
The police don't consult amateurs.

439
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,310
我昨天第一次见到你时
When I met you for the first time yesterday,

440
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,820
我说是阿富汗还是伊拉克
I said Afghanistan or Iraq.

441
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,420
- 你看起来很惊讶  - 对，你怎么知道的
- You looked surprised. - Yes, how did you know?

442
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,210
我不知道，我看到
I didn't know, I saw.

443
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,090
你的发型，站立姿势说明是军人
Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military.

444
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,070
- 但你说的话...  - 跟我那会儿有点不一样了
- But your conversation... - Bit different from my day.

445
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,750
说明在巴茨医院受训过  所以显然是军医
...said trained at Barts - so Army doctor, obvious.

446
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,200
你的脸晒黑了
Your face is tanned...

447
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,220
但手腕以上却没晒黑
but no tan above the wrists.

448
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,220
说明你从国外回来  但不是日光浴
You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.

449
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,650
你走路时跛得厉害
Your limp's really bad when you walk,

450
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,330
站立时却没要一把椅子，好像你忘了这事
but you don't ask for a chair when you stand, like you've forgotten about it,

451
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,270
所以多少有一部分是心理问题
so it's at least partly psychosomatic.

452
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,330
那说明受伤的原始环境是外伤
That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic.

453
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,900
是战斗负伤，战斗负伤
Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action,

454
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,210
晒黑  那就是阿富汗或伊拉克
suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

455
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,030
你说我在看心理咨询
You said I had a therapist.

456
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,150
你的跛脚是身心失调，当然要心理咨询
You've got a psychosomatic limp, of course you've got a therapist.

457
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,650
再说你的兄弟
Then there's your brother.

458
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,820
你的手机，很贵，能收发邮件，放MP3
Your phone. It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player.

459
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,310
你在找人合租，不会是自己买的，那么它是个礼物
You're looking for a flatshare. You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift then.

460
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,710
有刮痕  不止一两条  而是很多
Scratches. Not one, many over time -

461
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,710
肯定是跟钥匙硬币放在同一个口袋
it's been in the same pocket as keys and coins.

462
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,750
你不会这样对自己的奢侈品
You wouldn't treat your one luxury item like this,

463
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,190
所以它以前有个主人
so it's had a previous owner.

464
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,910
下一个就简单了  你已经知道了
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

465
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,590
刻的字吗
The engraving?

466
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,480
海瑞·华生，明显是一个家庭成员给了你他的旧手机
Harry Watson. Clearly a family member who's given you his old phone.

467
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,670
不是你父亲，这是年轻人款式
Not your father, this is a young man's gadget.

468
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,710
可能是表兄弟，但你是战斗英雄，找不到地方住
Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live.

469
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,670
不太可能你有个大家庭，当然不是你亲近的人
Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to.

470
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,730
那就是你兄弟
So brother it is.

471
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,230
现在说克拉拉，谁是克拉拉？
Now, Clara, who's Clara?

472
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,410
 “三个吻”说明两人是爱情关系
Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment.

473
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,430
手机昂贵，说明是妻子，不是女友
The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend.

474
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,630
肯定是最近才送的，这一款才发布六个月
Must have given it to him recently, the model's only six months old.

475
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,120
那就是婚姻出了问题  才用了六个月就送人
Marriage in trouble, then - six months on he's given it away.

476
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,230
如果是她离开他，他就会留着，人之常情，多愁善感
If she'd left him, he would have kept it. Peaple do, sentiment.

477
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,390
不，他想甩掉它，是他离开了她
No, he wanted rid of it. He left her.

478
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
他把手机给了你，那说明他想跟你保持联系
He gave the phone to you, so he wants you to stay in touch.

479
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,800
你在找便宜住处
You're looking for cheap accommodation,

480
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,400
却不去向自己兄弟求助
but not going to your brother for help.

481
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,220
这说明你跟他之间有问题
That says you've got problems with him.

482
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,200
也许是你喜欢他妻子，也许是你讨厌他喝酒
Maybe you liked his wife or maybe you don't like his drinking.

483
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,910
你怎么可能知道喝酒的事？
How can you possibly know about the drinking?

484
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,790
瞎猜的，不过猜得很好
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

485
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,160
电源插口  周围有细小的磨损痕迹
Power connection - tiny little scuff marks round the edge.

486
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,790
每晚他插上充电  但手总是在抖
Every night he goes to plug it in to charge, but his hands are shaking.

487
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,630
你绝不会在清醒的人手机上看到这种痕迹
You never see those marks on a sober man's phone,

488
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,270
醉鬼的手机上则绝不会没有，所以，瞧，你说得对
never see a drunk's without them. There you go, you were right.

489
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,240
我说得对？我说对了什么？
I was right? Right about what?

490
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,390
警察不会请教业余人员
The police don't consult amateurs.

491
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,870
这真是…太了不起了
That...was amazing.

492
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,790
- 你这么觉得吗？  - 当然是了
- Do you think so? - Of course it was.

493
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,470
这是非凡的，非同凡响
It was extraordinary, quite extraordinary.

494
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,070
- 别人一般不这么说  - 别人一般说什么？
- That's not what people normally say. - What do people normally say?

495
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,590
滚开
Piss off!

496
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,110
我有没有弄错什么？
Did I get anything wrong?

497
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,500
海瑞和我相处不来，从没好过
Harry and me don't get on, never have.

498
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,370
克拉拉和海瑞分手了，三个月前
Clara and Harry split up three months ago

499
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,900
他们正在办离婚
and they're getting a divorce.

500
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,110
而且海瑞是个酒徒
And Harry is a drinker.

501
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,410
那就是全中，我倒没期望事事都对
Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything.

502
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,150
海瑞是海莉特的昵称
Harry's short for Harriet.

503
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,550
海瑞是你姐姐
Harry's your sister.

504
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,920
- 我来这到底该干嘛来着？  - 姐姐
- What exactly am I supposed to be doing here? - Sister!

505
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,550
- 不，说真的，我来干嘛？  - 总是有点错
- No, seriously, what am I doing here? - There's always something.

506
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,730
你好  怪胎
Hello, freak!

507
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,230
我来找雷斯垂德探长
I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade.

508
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,210
为什么
Why?

509
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,010
我是受邀前来
I was invited.

510
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,170
- 为什么？  - 我想他要我来看看
- Why? - I think he wants me to take a look.

511
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,060
- 你知道我的想法，对吧  - 一向知道，萨莉
- You know what I think, don't you? - Always, Sally.

512
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,110
我甚至知道你昨晚没回家
I even know you didn't make it home last night.

513
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,110
- 我没…这位是谁？  - 我同事  华生医生
- Er...who's this? - Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

514
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,320
华生医生  这位是萨莉·多诺万警佐
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

515
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,750
老朋友
Old friend.

516
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,230
一个同事？你怎么会有同事？
A colleague? How do you get a colleague?

517
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,840
怎么？他跟踪你回家了？
What? Did he follow you home?

518
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,390
- 我在这里等着是不是更好  - 不
- Would it be better if I just waited...? - No.

519
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
怪胎来了 我带他进去
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

520
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,320
哦，安德森，又见面了
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

521
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,250
这是犯罪现场，我不想它被污染，说清楚了吗
It's a crime scene. I don't want it contaminated. Are we clear on that?

522
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,850
清楚得很
Quite clear.

523
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,050
你妻子很久不回家了吧？
And is your wife away for long?

524
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,670
别装得像你自己推理出来的，有人告诉你的吧
Oh, don't pretend you worked that out. Somebody told you that.

525
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,110
你的体香剂告诉我的
Your deodorant told me that.

526
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,730
- 我的体香剂？  - 是男用的
- My deodorant? - It's for men.

527
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,080
当然是男用的，就是我在用啊
Well, of course it's for men - I'm wearing it.

528
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,230
多诺万警佐也用了
So's Sergeant Donovan.

529
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,450
哦，它刚挥发掉了，我能进去了吗
Ooh...I think it just vaporised. May I go in?

530
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,500
- 听着，不管你在暗示什么  - 我什么都没暗示
- Now, look, whatever you're trying to imply... - I'm not implying anything.

531
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,800
我肯定萨莉只是顺道找你聊个小天
I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat

532
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,910
再碰巧过了个夜
and just happened to stay over.

533
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,000
我猜她还替你擦了地板，从她膝盖的状况来看
And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.

534
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,430
你得穿一件这衣服
You'll need to wear one of these.

535
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,400
这是哪位？
Who's this?

536
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,430
他跟我一起的
He's with me.

537
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,150
- 但他究竟是谁？  - 我说了跟我一起的
- But who is he? - I said he's with me.

538
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,010
你不穿一件吗？
Aren't you going to put one on?

539
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,150
- 我们去哪？  - 楼上
- So where are we? - Upstairs.

540
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,630
我可以给你两分钟
I can give you two minutes.

541
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,650
可能要更久
May need longer.

542
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,670
她名叫詹妮弗·威尔逊，根据她的信用卡
Her name's Jennifer Wilson, according to her credit cards.

543
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,350
我们正根据信用卡查她的联系方式
We're running them now for contact details.

544
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,110
时间还没过太久
Hasn't been here long.

545
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,790
几个孩子发现的
Some kids found her.

546
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,430
闭嘴
Shut up.

547
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,800
- 我什么也没说  - 你在思考，很吵
- I didn't say anything. - You were thinking. It's annoying.

548
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,730
有发现吗？
Got anything?

549
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,070
不太多
Not much.

550
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,150
她是德国人
She's German.

551
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,950
Rache 是德语的复仇  她可能想告诉我们...
Rache. It's German for revenge. She could be trying to tell us...

552
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,790
好了，感谢参与
Yes, thank you for your input.

553
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,380
- 她是德国人吗？  - 当然不是  不过倒是外地来的
- So she's German? - Of course she's not. She's from out of town, though.

554
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,930
打算在回加迪夫的家之前
Intended to stay in London for one night

555
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,120
在伦敦小住一夜，很明显
before returning home to Cardiff - so far, so obvious.

556
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,030
- 什么，很明显？  - 那这条信息呢？
- Sorry, obvious? - What about the message, though?

557
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,470
华生医生，你怎么看？
Dr Watson, what do you think?

558
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,840
- 那条信息吗？  - 尸体，你是医务人员
- Of the message? - Of the body. You're a medical man.

559
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,570
我们外面有一队人呢
We have a whole team outside.

560
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,520
他们不和我一起工作
They won't work with me.

561
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,300
我坏了所有规矩放你进来
I'm breaking every rule letting you in here...

562
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,500
是的，因为你需要我
Yes, because you need me.

563
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,270
是的，是这样
Yes, I do.

564
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,550
老天帮帮我
God help me.

565
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,350
华生医生
Dr Watson!

566
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,110
哦，按他说的做  请便
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

567
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,990
安德森，让大家在外面多等几分钟
Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes...

568
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,330
- 好吧  - 要我在这儿做什么
- Well? - What am I doing here?

569
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,640
帮我理清思路
Helping me make a point.

570
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,930
我本是帮你分担房租的
I'm supposed to help you pay the rent.

571
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,210
这更好玩
This is more fun.

572
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,270
好玩？一个女人横死在这里
Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

573
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,910
完美的分析  不过我希望你再深入些
Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper.

574
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,490
对...窒息...可能
Yeah... Asphyxiation...probably.

575
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,670
昏倒，被她自己的呕吐物噎住
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

576
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,500
她身上闻不出酒精
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

577
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,470
可以是癫痫发作  可能是药物
It could have been a seizure. Possibly drugs.

578
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,550
你知道那是什么  你读过报纸
You know what it was, you've read the papers.

579
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,060
对，她是自杀者之一，第四个...
Well, she's one of the suicides. The fourth...?

580
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,340
夏洛克  我说过你2分钟
Sherlock, two minutes, I said.

581
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,750
我需要你的发现
I need anything you've got.

582
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,400
死者年龄三十大几
Victim is in her late 30s.

583
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,110
职业女性  从她的衣着来看
Professional person, going by her clothes.

584
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,410
我猜是媒体业，根据那触目惊心的粉红色
I'm guessing something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink.

585
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,820
今天刚从加迪夫过来
Travelled from Cardiff today

586
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,850
打算在伦敦住一晚，看她手提箱的大小就知道了
intending to stay in London for one night from the size of her suitcase.

587
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,010
- 手提箱？  - 对  手提箱
- Suitcase? - Suitcase, yes.

588
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,760
她结婚起码10年  但不幸福
She's been married at least ten years, but not happily.

589
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,600
她有一串情人  但没一个知道她结婚了
She's had a string of lovers, but none of them knew she was married.

590
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,630
老天啊  这要都是你编出来...
Oh, for God's sake, if you're just making this up...

591
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,190
她的婚戒  起码已经有10年了
Her wedding ring. Ten years old at least.

592
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,210
她别的首饰都做过定期保养
The rest of herjewellery has been regularly cleaned,

593
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,900
而婚戒却没有  她的婚姻状况就是如此
but not her wedding ring. State of her marriage right there.

594
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,730
戒指的里圈要比外圈光亮许多
The inside is shinier than the outside,

595
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,930
说明经常拿下来
that means it's regularly removed.

596
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,150
戒指只有在她取下来时才会被磨亮
The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger.

597
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,750
不是为了工作，看看她的指甲
It's not for work, look at her nails.

598
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,940
她不是做手工活的
She doesn't work with her hands,

599
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,530
那她是为了什么或是谁取下戒指呢
so what or who does she remove her rings for?

600
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,630
显然不是一个情人
Clearly not one lover

601
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,990
她绝不能这么长时间编造单身身份
she'd never sustain the fiction of being single for that long,

602
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,870
- 因此肯定不止一个  简单  - 厉害
- so more likely a string of them. Simple. - That's brilliant.

603
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,510
- 抱歉  - 加迪夫呢？
- Sorry. - Cardiff?

604
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,200
很明显，不是吗
It's obvious, isn't it?

605
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,830
对我不明显
It's not obvious to me.

606
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,200
神啊，你那可笑的小脑袋是啥样？一定蛮无聊的
Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring.

607
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,150
她的外套
Her coat

608
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,790
有点潮湿  几小时前她一定淋了场大雨
it's slightly damp, she's been in heavy rain in the last few hours -

609
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,570
当时伦敦任何地方都没下雨
no rain anywhere in London in that time.

610
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,380
外套领子下面也是湿的
Under her coat collar is damp too.

611
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,150
她曾把领子立起来挡风
She's turned it up against the wind.

612
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,990
她左边口袋里有把伞  但是干的  没用过
She's got an umbrella in her left pocket, but it's dry and unused.

613
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,410
不单有风 是大风  大到无法撑伞
Not just wind, strong wind - too strong to use her umbrella.

614
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,980
我们从她的手提箱可知，她准备过夜
We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight

615
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,150
所以她一定来自远方
so she must come distance

616
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,920
但她不可能已外出超过两三个小时
but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours,

617
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,230
因为她的外套还没干
because her coat still hasn't dried.

618
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,810
所以 在其旅行时间半径内 什么地方曾有过大风大雨？
So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?

619
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,990
加迪夫
Cardiff.

620
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,470
- 太神奇了  - 你知道自己说出声来了吗
- That's fantastic. - Do you know you do that out loud?

621
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,910
- 抱歉 我会闭嘴的  - 不  没关系
- Sorry, I'll shut up. - No, it's...fine.

622
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,640
你为什么总提到手提箱？
Why do you keep saying suitcase?

623
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,950
对，它在哪里？
Yes, where is it?

624
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,650
她肯定带了手机或是电子本
She must have had a phone or an organiser.

625
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,780
查出瑞琪儿是何人
Find out who Rachel is.

626
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,110
她写的是瑞琪儿？
She was writing Rachel?

627
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,390
不，她写的是复仇的德语
No, she was leaving an angry note in German!

628
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,670
当然写的是瑞琪儿 不可能是别的字
Of course she was writing Rachel, no other word it can be.

629
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,110
问题是她为何要等到临死前才写这个
But the question is why did she wait until she was dying to write it?

630
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,650
你怎么知道她有个手提箱？
How do you know she had a suitcase?

631
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,720
看看右腿
Look at the right leg.

632
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,200
右脚踝和小腿上有小泥点，而左腿上没有
Tiny splash marks on her right heel and calf not present on the left.

633
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,390
她用右手拖着个轮式手提箱在后面
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand.

634
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,330
那些泥点没有飞到别处
Don't get that splash pattern any other way.

635
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,350
是短小的箱子，根据泥点分布
Smallish case, going by the spread.

636
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,430
那种尺寸的箱子，这样穿着的女人
Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious -

637
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,730
只可能是一只过夜旅行箱
could only be an overnight bag

638
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,020
所以我们知道她打算过一夜
so we know she was staying one night.

639
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,590
它在哪里？你们检查过了吗
Where is it? What have you done with it?

640
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,470
没有箱子
There wasn't a case.

641
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,210
再说一次
Say that again.

642
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,520
没有箱子，这里根本就没有什么手提箱
There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase.

643
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,980
手提箱，有谁见过一个手提箱？
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?

644
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,830
这房子里有手提箱吗
Was there a suitcase in this house?

645
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,430
夏洛克，这里没有箱子
Sherlock, there was no case!

646
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,980
但他们自己服毒
But they take the poison themselves,

647
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,340
他们自己选择吞下药丸
they choose swallow the pills themselves.

648
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,630
迹象明显，就算是你的手下也不可能错过
There are clear signs, even you lot couldn't miss them.

649
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,130
好吧  谢谢  还有呢
Right, thanks. And...?

650
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,810
是谋杀，全都是，我还没搞清
It's murder, all of them. I don't know how.

651
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,530
但绝不是自杀，是他杀，连环杀人案
But they're not suicides, they're killings, they're serial killings.

652
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,230
一个连环杀人犯，我爱死了
We've got a serial killer. Love those.

653
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,750
总能让人有各种期待
There's always something to look forward to.

654
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
你为什么这么说？
Why are you saying that?

655
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,300
她的箱子，拜托，她的箱子在哪里？
Her case! Come on, where is her case?

656
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,650
是她吃了吗？
Did she eat it?

657
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,430
另有别人来过这里，并拿走了她的箱子
Someone else was here and they took her case.

658
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,410
所以凶手必是驱车至此
So the killer must have driven here.

659
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,750
忘了箱子在车上
Forgot the case was in the car.

660
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,050
她也可能先入住酒店，把箱子留在那里
She could have checked into a hotel, left it there.

661
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,450
不，她从没到过酒店，看看她的头发
No, she never got to the hotel. Look at her hair.

662
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,520
她的颜色搭配，唇彩和鞋子
She colour-coordinates her lipstick and shoes.

663
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,790
她绝不会那样离开酒店，她的头发还…
She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking...

664
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,400
夏洛克，是什么，是什么？
Sherlock? What is it, what?

665
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,000
连环杀人犯总是很难搞
Serial killers, always hard.

666
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,070
你得等他们犯一个错误
You have to wait for them to make a mistake.

667
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,990
我们不能光等着
We can't just wait!

668
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,810
等待已经结束了，看看她，仔细看
Oh, we're done waiting. Look at her, really look!

669
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,650
休斯顿，我们有错误了  快去加迪夫
Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff.

670
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,930
找到詹妮弗·威尔逊的家人和朋友在哪
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends were.

671
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,780
找到瑞琪儿
Find Rachel!

672
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,590
当然，好  但是什么错误？
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

673
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,550
粉色
Pink!

674
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,210
我们开工
Let's get on with it...

675
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,850
- 他走了  - 夏洛克·福尔摩斯吗？
- He's gone. - Who, Sherlock Holmes?

676
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,870
对，他刚走，他总这样
Yeah, he just took off. He does that.

677
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,070
- 他还会回来吗？  - 看来不会
- Is he coming back? - Didn't look like it.

678
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,320
好吧
Right.

679
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,270
好吧
Right...

680
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,590
好，打扰了，我在哪里？
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

681
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,230
布里克斯顿
Brixton.

682
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,210
我…你知道我能在哪儿打到车吗
I...Do you know where I could get a cab?

683
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,610
只是…
It's just, er...

684
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,670
那个…我的腿
well... my leg.

685
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,450
试试主路上
try the main road.

686
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,790
谢谢
Thanks.

687
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,310
可你不是他的朋友
But you're not his friend.

688
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,390
他没有朋友
He doesn't have friends.

689
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,470
所以你是谁呢？
So who are you?

690
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,530
我…我谁也不是，我刚认识他
I'm...I'm nobody. I just met him.

691
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,630
好吧，一点忠告，离那人远点
OK, bit of advice, then. Stay away from that guy.

692
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
为什么？
Why?

693
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,800
你知道他为什么来这里吗？
You know why he's here?

694
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,500
他没有报酬什么的
He's not paid or anything.

695
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,110
他喜欢这个，他乐在其中
He likes it. He gets off on it.

696
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,350
犯罪越古怪，他越享受，而且知道吗？
The weirder the crime, the more he gets off. And you know what...?

697
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,750
总有一天，揭露犯罪不再能满足他
One day just showing up won't be enough.

698
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,270
总有一天，我们会站在一具尸体边
One day we'll be standing round a body,

699
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,190
而夏洛克·福尔摩斯便是抛尸之人
and Sherlock Holmes'll be the one that put it there.

700
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,030
- 他为什么会这么做？  - 因为他就是个疯子
- Why would he do that? - Because he's a psychopath.

701
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,850
疯子容易无聊
Psychopaths get bored.

702
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,590
- 多诺万  - 来了
- Donovan! - Coming.

703
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,070
离夏洛克·福尔摩斯远点
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

704
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,630
出租车 出租车
Taxi! Taxi...

705
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,230
喂
Hello?

706
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,980
有个监控摄像头在你左边大楼上
There is a security camera on the building to your left.

707
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,310
你看到了吗
Do you see it?

708
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
你是谁？
Who's this?

709
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,030
谁在说话？
Who's speaking?

710
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,030
你看到那个摄像头了吗，华生医生？
Do you see the camera, Dr Watson?

711
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,500
- 对，我看到了  - 看好
- Yeah, I see it. - Watch...

712
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,230
还有一个摄像头在你对面的房子上
There is another camera on the building opposite you.

713
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,230
看到了吗
Do you see it?

714
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,510
最后，在你右边的楼顶上
And finally, at the top of the building on your right.

715
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,030
你怎么做到的？
How are you doing this?

716
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,120
上车，华生医生
Get into the car, Dr Watson.

717
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,390
我不想发什么威胁
I would make some sort of threat,

718
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,790
但我肯定你相当清楚自己的处境
but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you.

719
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,830
- 你好  - 嗨
- Hello. - Hi.

720
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,500
你叫什么名字？
What's your name, then?

721
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,790
哦…安茜娅
Er...Anthea.

722
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,630
这是你的真名吗？
Is that your real name?

723
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,630
不是
No.

724
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,000
我叫约翰
I'm John.

725
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,910
对，我知道
Yes. I know.

726
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,310
问这个有意义吗…我要去哪里？
Any point in asking...where I'm going?

727
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,000
完全没有
None at all...

728
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,470
约翰
John.

729
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,190
好吧
Ok.

730
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,990
请坐，约翰
Have a seat, John.

731
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,390
你知道，我有手机
You know, I've got a phone.

732
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,350
我是说，你那些搞得很聪明
I mean, very clever and all that,

733
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,430
但是
but, er...

734
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,190
你可以直接打给我
you could just phone me.

735
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,670
打我手机
On my phone.

736
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,070
人要避开夏洛克·福尔摩斯的注意
When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes,

737
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,450
就得谨慎些，所以挑了这地方
one learns to be discreet, hence this place.

738
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,580
你的腿一定很疼，坐吧
Your leg must be hurting you. Sit down.

739
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,110
我不想坐下
I don't want to sit down.

740
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,310
你看起来不太害怕
You don't seem very afraid.

741
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,750
你看起来不太吓人
You don't seem very frightening.

742
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,390
是啊
Yes...

743
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,310
军人的勇敢
The bravery of the soldier.

744
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,380
“勇敢”其实是“愚蠢”一词的仁慈说法，你不觉得吗
Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think?

745
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,010
你跟夏洛克·福尔摩斯是何关系？
What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?

746
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,400
没有，我几乎不认识他，我跟他结识是在…
I don't have one. I barely know him. I met him...

747
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,110
昨天
yesterday.

748
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,210
呣，既然你昨天搬进他那里
Mmm, and since yesterday, you've moved in with him

749
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,310
现在你俩就一起查案
and now you're solving crimes together.

750
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,730
也许我们可以期待到周末有个订婚喜讯？
Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?

751
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,450
- 你是谁？  - 利害相关方罢了
- Who are you? - An interested party.

752
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,270
与夏洛克相关？为何？
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

753
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,230
我猜你们不是朋友
I'm guessing you're not friends.

754
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,950
你见过他了，你能想象他有几个朋友？
You've met him. How many friends do you imagine he has?

755
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,770
我是夏洛克·福尔摩斯所能拥有的，最接近于“朋友”的东西
I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.

756
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,370
那是啥？
And what's that?

757
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,430
- 一个敌人  - 一个敌人？
- An enemy. - An enemy?

758
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,700
当然，是他心目中的
In his mind, certainly.

759
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,230
如果你去问他，他可能会说是他的死敌
If you were to ask him, he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

760
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,410
他确实爱搞戏剧化
He does love to be dramatic.

761
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,950
谢谢老天，你倒不戏剧化
Well, thank God you're above all that

762
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,100
希望我没有让你分心
I hope I'm not distracting you.

763
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,710
完全没有让我分心
Not distracting me at all.

764
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,700
你计划继续与夏洛克·福尔摩斯交往吗？
Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?

765
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,970
我可能说错了
I could be wrong...

766
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,410
但是…我认为这不是你操心的事
but I think that's none of your business.

767
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,990
- 可能是  - 真的不可能
- It could be. - It really couldn't.

768
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,950
如果你真的搬入…
If you do move into, um...

769
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,870
贝克街221B
...22 1 B Baker Street,

770
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,900
我将乐意定期给你提供一笔可观的费用，用以…
I'd be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis

771
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,110
替你分忧
to ease your way.

772
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,600
为何？
Why?

773
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,050
因为你不是有钱人
Because you're not a wealthy man.

774
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,710
以此交换什么？
In exchange for what?

775
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,000
情报
Information.

776
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,100
无非分请求  不会让你感到…为难
Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you'd feel...uncomfortable with.

777
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,730
只需告诉我他在干什么
Just tell me what he's up to.

778
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,470
为什么
Why?

779
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,910
我担心他，时不时地
I worry about him. Constantly.

780
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,510
你真好
That's nice of you.

781
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,260
不过出于各种理由，我宁愿我的关心不被提起
But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned.

782
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:13,230
我们的关系你也许可以称之为…艰难
We have what you might call a... difficult relationship.

783
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,270
- 不  - 可我还没提具体数字呢
- No. - But I haven't mentioned a figure.

784
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,320
不必费心了
Don't bother.

785
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,900
你非常忠诚，非常果断
You're very loyal very quickly.

786
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,710
不，我不是，我只是没兴趣
No, I'm not, I'm just not interested.

787
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,590
“信任危机” ，这里写着
"Trust issues", it says here.

788
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
那是什么？
What's that?

789
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,510
可不可以说 你已决定在所有人中信任夏洛克·福尔摩斯了？
Could it be that you've decided to trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?

790
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,660
谁说我信任他了？
Who says I trust him?

791
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,550
你不像善交朋友的人
You don't seem the kind to make friends easily.

792
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,710
咱们说完了吗
Are we done?

793
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,270
你说呢
You tell me.

794
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,530
我想有人已警告过你远离他
I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him,

795
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,710
不过我能从你的左手看出 你不会那么做
but I can see from your left hand that's not going to happen.

796
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,310
- 我的什么？  - 给我看看
- My what? - Show me.

797
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,330
不要…
Don't...

798
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,510
- 不一般  - 什么东西？
- Remarkable. - What is?

799
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,040
多数人在这城里东奔西撞
Most people blunder round this city

800
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,010
他们所见只有街道、商铺和汽车
and all they see are streets and shops and cars.

801
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,570
你和夏洛克·福尔摩斯一起行走时，你看到了战场
When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield.

802
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,690
你已经看到了，对吗？
You've seen it already, haven't you?

803
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,350
我的手怎么了？
What's wrong with my hand?

804
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,000
你的左手有间歇性颤抖
You have an intermittent tremor in your left hand.

805
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,470
你的理疗师认为那是创后应激障碍
Your therapist thinks it's post-traumatic stress disorder.

806
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,450
她认为你被军役生涯的记忆所纠缠
She thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service.

807
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,990
你到底是谁？
Who the hell are you?

808
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,550
这你怎么能知道？
How do you know that?

809
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,400
辞了她，她完全搞错了
Fire her. She's got it the wrong way round.

810
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,000
你现在就处于压力下，而你的手完全稳定
You're under stress right now, and your hand is perfectly steady.

811
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,590
你不是受战争困扰，华生医生
You're not haunted by the war, Dr Watson...

812
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,170
你想念它
You miss it.

813
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,550
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

814
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,470
是时候选一边了，华生医生
Time to choose a side, Dr Watson.

815
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,270
我来送你回家
I'm to take you home.

816
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,110
地址？
Address?

817
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,230
贝克街
Er, Baker Street.

818
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,030
贝克街221B
22 1 B Baker Street.

819
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,400
不过我得先去个地方
But I need to stop off somewhere first.

820
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,030
听着，你的老板
Listen, your boss.

821
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,600
有没有可能你不告诉他这是我来的地方？
Any chance you could not tell him this is where I went?

822
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,510
- 可以  - 你已经告诉他了，对吧
- Sure. - You've told him already, haven't you?

823
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,070
对
Yeah.

824
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,510
你有没有什么空闲时间？
do you ever get any free time?

825
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,870
有，很多
Oh, yeah. Lots.

826
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,630
- 拜  - 好
- Bye. - OK.

827
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,370
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

828
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,620
尼古丁贴片
Nicotine patch.

829
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,430
帮助我思考
Helps me think.

830
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,330
这年头在伦敦 不可能维持吸烟的习惯
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days.

831
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,050
对脑力劳动是坏消息
Bad news for brain work.

832
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,220
对呼吸是好消息
It's good news for breathing.

833
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,030
呼吸，呼吸太无聊
Oh, breathing! Breathing's boring.

834
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,830
那是…三片吗？
Is that...three patches?

835
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,810
这是三片难度的问题
It's a three-patch problem.

836
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,030
嗯
Well...?

837
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,030
你要我回来  我想是要紧事
You asked me to come, I'm assuming it's important.

838
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,210
对  当然  我能借用你的手机吗？
Oh, yeah, of course. Can I borrow your phone?

839
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,310
我的手机？
My phone?

840
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,730
我的号码有可能被认出来
There's always a chance that my number will be recognised.

841
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,690
网站上有
It's on the website.

842
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,790
哈德森太太有手机
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.

843
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,500
对，她在楼下
Yeah, she's downstairs.

844
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,820
我试过喊了，但她没听见
I tried shouting, but she didn't hear.

845
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,080
我当时在伦敦另一头
I was the other side of London...

846
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:01,790
这不急
There was no hurry.

847
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,350
给...
Here...

848
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,190
那么，那个箱子怎么了
So what's this about the case?

849
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,460
- 她的箱子  - 她的箱子？
- Her case... - Her case?

850
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,630
她的手提箱，对，很明显
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

851
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,070
凶手拿走她的手提箱  第一个大错
The murderer took her suitcase, first big mistake.

852
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,750
好吧，他拿了她的箱子，所以？
OK, he took her case. So?

853
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,600
这没用，没别的办法了，我们得冒个险
It's no use, there's no other way. We'll have to risk it.

854
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,510
我书桌上有个手机号  我要你发个短信
On my desk there's a number. I want you to send a text.

855
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,130
你叫我回来…就发个短信？
You've brought me here... to send a text.

856
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,130
短信，对，号码在我桌上
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

857
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,850
- 怎么了？  - 刚才见了你一位朋友
- What's wrong? - Just met a friend of yours.

858
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,860
- 一个朋友？  - 一个敌人
- A friend? - An enemy.

859
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,270
哦，哪个？
Oh. Which one?

860
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,220
你的死敌，他说的
Well, your arch-enemy, according to him.

861
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,650
人会有死敌吗？
Do people have arch-enemies?

862
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,190
他是不是给你钱来监视我？
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

863
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,910
- 是的  - 你收了吗？
- Yes. - Did you take it?

864
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,410
没
No.

865
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,230
可惜，我们可以把钱分了，下次要三思
Pity, we could have split the fee. Think it through next time.

866
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,590
他是谁？
Who is he?

867
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,310
你见过的最危险人物 但不是我现在的问题
The most dangerous man you've ever met and not my problem right now.

868
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,030
我桌上 手机号
On my desk, the number!

869
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,190
詹妮弗·威尔逊，这是...
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

870
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,230
等等，这不是那个女死者吗
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

871
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,000
是的，这不重要，输这个号码就好
Yes. That's not important. Just enter the number.

872
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,880
- 你在输吗  - 对
- Are you doing it? - Yes.

873
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,040
- 输完了吗  - 是的，等等
- Have you done it? - Yeah, hang on!

874
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,750
一字不差输这些
These words exactly.

875
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,230
“劳瑞斯顿花园发生了什么事
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

876
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,030
我一定是昏过去了
"I must have blacked out.

877
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,630
诺森伯兰大街22号  请快过来”
"22 Northumberland Street, please come."

878
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,110
- 你昏过去了吗  - 什么？没有...没有
- You blacked out? - What? No... No!

879
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,870
输入然后发送 快
Type and send it. Quickly.

880
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,870
- 发送了吗  - 地址是？
- Have you sent it? - What's the address?

881
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,310
诺森伯兰大街22号  赶紧的
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

882
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,870
这是...
That's...

883
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,940
这是粉衣女士的箱子，詹妮弗·威尔逊的箱子
That's the pink lady's case, that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

884
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,150
是的，显然
Yes, obviously.

885
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,990
也许我该提一下  我没杀她
Oh, perhaps I should mention - I didn't kill her.

886
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,340
- 我从没说是你  - 为什么不是
- I never said you did. - Why not?

887
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,510
鉴于我刚让你发的那短信，而我事实上又有她的箱子
Given that text I just had you send and the fact I have her case,

888
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,210
这是完全合乎逻辑的假设
it's a perfectly logical assumption.

889
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,310
人们通常把你看成凶手吗
Do people usually assume you're the murderer?

890
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:32,950
时不时会
Now and then, yes.

891
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,550
好吧
Ok...

892
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,670
- 你从哪弄来的？  - 找到的
- How did you get this? - By looking.

893
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,710
哪里
Where?

894
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,660
凶手一定是开车带她到劳瑞斯顿花园
The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens.

895
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,390
他碰巧留下箱子只可能是因为它在车里
He could only keep her case by accident if it was in a car.

896
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,400
没人能带着这箱子而不引人注目
Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention to himself

897
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,110
尤其是男人 这在统计学上更可能
particularly a man, which is statistically more likely.

898
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,270
所以显然 当他发现箱子还在 就急着处理掉它
So obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it with he noticed that he still had it

899
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,830
用不了五分钟 他就意识到自己的错误
Wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake

900
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,350
我检查了劳瑞斯顿花园五分钟车程内每一条后巷
I checked every backstreet wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens

901
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,750
以及任何能不引起注意处理掉大件物品的地方
and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed.

902
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,100
花了不到一小时就找到了
Took me less than an hour to find the right skip.

903
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,780
粉色，你推论出一切，就因为你认识到箱子会是粉色的吗
Pink. You got all that because you realised the case would be pink?

904
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,970
- 必须是粉色，显然  - 我怎么没想到
- It had to be pink, obviously. - Why didn't I think of that

905
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,030
因为你是傻瓜
Because you're an idiot.

906
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,600
不不，别这副表情，实际上人人都是
No, no, don't look like that. Practically everyone is.

907
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,760
现在看看  你发现少了什么吗
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

908
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,150
箱子里吗？我怎么知道？
From the case? How could I?

909
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,020
她的电话  她的手机在哪里？
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

910
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,800
死者身上没手机  箱子里没有手机
There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case.

911
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,110
我们知道她有，就是你刚发短信的那个
We know she had one. That's the one there you just texted it.

912
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,190
也许她落在家里了
Maybe she left it at home.

913
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,830
她有一串情人  她对此很小心
She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it.

914
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,100
绝不会把手机落在家里
She never leaves her phone at home.

915
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,910
那我刚才发短信干嘛？
Er... Why did I just send that text?

916
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,430
问题是，她的手机现在哪里？
Well, the question is where is her phone now?

917
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,910
- 她可能弄丢了  - 对，或者？
- She could have lost it. - Yes, or?

918
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,000
那个凶手，你认为凶手拿着手机？
The murderer... You think the murderer has the phone?

919
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,160
也许她…把手机连同箱子落在车里
Maybe she...left it when she left her case.

920
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,440
也许他出于某种原因拿走了
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.

921
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,140
不管哪种，机率上倾向于凶手拿着她的手机
Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.

922
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,190
抱歉…我们在做什么？
Sorry...what are we doing?

923
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,030
我刚才是不是给凶手发短信了？这么做有何好处？
Did I just text a murderer? What good will that do?

924
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,080
距离上一个受害者才几小时
A few hours after his last victim,

925
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,590
而现在他收到只可能来自她的短信
and now he receives a text that can only be from her.

926
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,840
如果只是某人捡到那手机，会忽略那样一条短信
If somebody had just found that phone, they'd ignore a text like that,

927
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,410
但那个凶手…
but the murderer...

928
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,410
会惊慌
would panic.

929
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,730
你告诉警方了吗？
Have you talked to the police?

930
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,570
已有四人遇害  没时间告诉警方
Four people are dead, there isn't time to talk to the police

931
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,110
那你为何告诉我？
So why are you talking to me?

932
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,950
哈德森太太拿走了我的骷髅
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

933
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,210
所以我主要是填补你的骷髅空虚？
So I'm basically filling in for your skull?

934
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,700
放心，你做得不错
Relax, you're doing fine.

935
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,830
- 那么…  - 那么什么？
- Well? - Well, what?

936
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,840
那么，你可以坐在那儿，看电视
Well...you could just sit there and...watch telly.

937
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:43,930
你要我跟你去吗？
You want me to come with you?

938
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,300
我出门喜欢有个伴，而且我大声说话时思考更佳
I like company when I go out and I think better when I talk aloud.

939
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,710
骷髅只会引人注目，所以…
The skull just attracts attention, so...

940
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,330
有问题？
Problem?

941
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,000
对，多诺万警佐
Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

942
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,990
她怎么了
What about her?

943
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,390
她说，你沉迷于此，你享受其中
She said you get off on this, you enjoy it.

944
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,950
我也说过“有危险”  你也来了
And I said "Dangerous", and here you are.

945
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,070
该死
Damn it!

946
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,100
我们现在去哪里？
Where are we going?

947
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,460
诺森伯兰街，从这走路五分钟
Northumberland Street's a five-minute walk from here.

948
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,020
你真认为他会蠢到去那里吗？
You think he's stupid enough to go there?

949
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,910
不，我认为他够聪明
No, I think he's brilliant enough.

950
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,110
我爱那些聪明的
I love the brilliant ones.

951
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,030
他们都极其渴望被抓
They're all so desperate to get caught.

952
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,190
- 为什么？  - 赞赏
- Why? - Appreciation!

953
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,830
喝彩！ 最终成为焦点人物
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

954
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,630
那是天才们的弱点，约翰，需要一个观众
That's the frailty of genius, John, it needs an audience.

955
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,750
是啊
Yeah.

956
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,400
这就是他的猎场
This is his hunting ground.

957
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,870
就在这里，在城市的心脏
Right here in the heart of the city.

958
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,660
既然我们知道他的受害者是被劫持的
Now that we know his victims were abducted,

959
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,230
这改变了一切
that changes everything.

960
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,200
因为他所有的受害者都消失在闹市街头
Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places,

961
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,310
可没人看见他们消失
but nobody saw them go.

962
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,680
想想，谁是我们即便不认识也信任的人
Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them?

963
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,750
谁去哪里都不引人注意？
Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?

964
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,400
谁在人群当中狩猎？
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

965
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,000
不知道  谁？
Don't know. Who?

966
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,350
茫无头绪，饿吗？
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

967
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,630
谢谢，比利
Thank you, Billy.

968
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,710
诺森伯兰街22号
22 Northumberland Street.

969
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,400
留心盯着
Keep your eyes on it.

970
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,990
他不会直接去按门铃，那得疯了才会
He's not just going to ring the doorbell. He'd need to be mad.

971
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,510
他已杀了四个人
He has killed four people.

972
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:22,470
好吧
Ok.

973
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,450
夏洛克
Sherlock!

974
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,100
菜单上有的，不管你想吃什么，免费
Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free.

975
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,310
店里买单，给你和你的约会对象
On the house, for you and for your date.

976
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,870
- 你想吃东西吗  - 我不是他的对象
- Do you want to eat? - I'm not his date.

977
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,990
这人帮我洗脱了谋杀嫌疑
This man got me off a murder charge.

978
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,990
这位是安杰洛
This is Angelo.

979
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,150
三年前我向雷斯垂德成功证实…
Three years ago, I successful proved to Lestrade,

980
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,880
一起恶性三重谋杀案发生时
at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder,

981
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,950
安杰洛正在城里别的地方，入室行劫
that Angelo was in a different part of town, house-breaking.

982
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,020
- 他清洗了我的名誉  - 我洗刷了一点
- He cleared my name. - I cleared it a bit.

983
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,340
对街有情况吗
Anything happening opposite?

984
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,470
没有
Nothing.

985
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,330
要不是这个人，我就得进监狱了
But for this man, I'd have gone to prison.

986
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,420
你是进了监狱
You did go to prison.

987
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,110
我拿支蜡烛放桌上，更浪漫点
I'll get a candle for the table. It's more romantic.

988
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,590
我不是他对象
I'm not his date!

989
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,470
你最好吃点  我们可能得等很久
You may as well eat. We might have a long wait.

990
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,990
谢谢
Thanks.

991
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,110
一般人没有死敌
People don't have arch-enemies.

992
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,110
- 说啥？  - 在现实生活中
- I'm sorry? - In real life.

993
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,680
现实中不存在死敌  没这种事
There are no arch-enemies in real life. Doesn't happen.

994
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,980
没有吗？ 听起来有点闷
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

995
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,930
所以我遇见了谁？
So who did I meet?

996
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,710
那么常人有什么，在“真实生活”中
What do real people have, then, in their..."real lives"?

997
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,070
朋友？
Friends?

998
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,550
认识的人  喜欢的人  不喜欢的人
People they know, people they like, people they don't like...

999
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,270
- 女朋友或男朋友  - 对，正如我所说 闷
- Girlfriends, boyfriends. - Yes, well, as I was saying, dull.

1000
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,200
这么说你没有女朋友？
You don't have a girlfriend, then?

1001
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,110
女朋友？没有，算不上是我的范畴
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

1002
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,030
哦，好吧
Mm. Oh, right.

1003
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,760
那你有男朋友吗？这其实也没关系
Do you have a boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way.

1004
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:49,300
我知道没关系
I know it's fine.

1005
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,700
- 那你有男朋友？  - 没有
- So you've got a boyfriend, then. - No.

1006
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,100
好的  懂了
Right. OK.

1007
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,030
你是独一个 跟我一样
You're unattached. Like me.

1008
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,250
好  不错
Fine. Good.

1009
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,780
约翰…我想你应该了解
John, um...I think you should know

1010
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,400
我当自己与工作结婚了  虽然我受宠若惊
I consider myself married to my work and while I'm flattered,

1011
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:19,680
- 但是我真的不是要找...  - 不  我不是在问  不
- I'm really not looking for any... - No, I'm...not asking. No.

1012
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,030
我只是在说  全都没关系
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

1013
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,430
很好
Good.

1014
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,350
谢谢你
Thank you.

1015
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,540
看对街 出租车 停下了
Look across the street. Taxi. It's stopped.

1016
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,390
没人上车  也没人下车
Nobody getting in and nobody getting out.

1017
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,700
为什么是出租车？
Why a taxi?

1018
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,100
哦，聪明啊
Oh, that's clever.

1019
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,210
- 这样聪明吗？这样为什么聪明？  - 那是他？
- Is it clever? Why is it clever? - That's him.

1020
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,510
- 别盯着看  - 你也在盯着
- Don't stare. - You're staring.

1021
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,500
咱俩不能都盯着
We can't both stare.

1022
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,630
抱歉
Sorry...

1023
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,350
- 我记下车牌号码了  - 做得好
- I've got the cab number. - Good for you.

你是第一次来伦敦，对吧
First trip to London, right?

00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,030
让的哥载着你四处找目的地吧
Going by your final destination and the cabbie's taking you?

1061
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,510
你留着那个，我还有很多在公寓里
You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat.

1062
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:01,130
什么？
What?

1063
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,230
没什么，只是…“欢迎来到伦敦”
Nothing, just..."Welcome to London."

1064
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,870
- 气喘上来了吗？  - 随时都可以
- Got your breath back? - Ready when you are.

1065
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,710
这真荒唐
That was ridiculous.

1066
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,230
这是我干过最荒唐的事，有生以来
That was the most ridiculous thing... I've ever done.

1067
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,650
你可是入侵过阿富汗的
And you invaded Afghanistan.

1068
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,530
那可不止我一个
That wasn't just me.

1069
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,230
我们为何不回餐厅？
Why aren't we back at the restaurant?

1070
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,020
他们会盯着的
They can keep an eye out.

1071
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,540
反正机会不大
It was a long shot anyway.

1072
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,470
那我们刚才去那里干嘛？
So what were we doing there?

1073
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,990
只是打发时间
Oh, just passing the time.

1074
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,670
还证明一个观点
And proving a point.

1075
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,230
- 什么观点？  - 你
- What point? - You.

1076
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:51,440
哈德森太太，华生医生要楼上的房间
Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson willtake the room upstairs.

1077
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,750
谁说的？
Says who?

1078
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,390
门外的人说的
Says the man at the door.

1079
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,510
夏洛克发短信给我
Sherlock texted me.

1080
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,310
他说你忘了这个
He said you forgot this.

1081
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,730
谢谢你
Er, thank you.

1082
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:15,670
谢谢你
Thank you.

1083
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,670
夏洛克，你干了什么？
Sherlock, what have you done?

1084
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,910
- 哈德森太太？  - 楼上
- Mrs Hudson? - Upstairs.

1085
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,870
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1086
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,890
我就知道你找到了箱子，我不笨
I knew you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.

1087
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,370
你不能闯进我的公寓
You can't just break into my flat.

1088
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:34,130
你不能擅留证据，况且我没闯进你的公寓
You can't withhold evidence - and I didn't break into your flat.

1089
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,310
那你把这叫做什么？
What do you call this, then?

1090
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,630
这是一次缉毒行动
It's a drugs bust.

1091
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,030
你认真的？这个人 瘾君子？
Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

1092
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,990
- 你还不了解他吗？  - 约翰
- Have you met him? - John...

1093
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,970
我敢肯定你可以在这公寓搜查一天
I'm pretty sure you could search this flat all day,

1094
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,120
也绝不会找到任何称得上娱乐消遣的东西
you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational.

1095
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,670
- 约翰，你也许该闭嘴了  - 但是这…
- John, you probably want to shut up now. - But come on...

1096
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,910
- 不…  - 什么？
- No... - What?

1097
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,070
- 你？  - 闭嘴
- You? - Shut up!

1098
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,870
- 我不是你的缉毒犬  - 不  安德森是我的缉毒犬
- I'm not your sniffer dog. - No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

1099
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,270
安德森，缉毒行动与你何干？
Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust?

1100
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,560
我自愿来的
Oh, I volunteered.

1101
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,420
他们都是自愿的，他们严格来说不是缉毒组的
They all did. They're not strictly speaking on the drug squad,

1102
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:06,110
但他们很敏锐
but they're very keen.

1103
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,220
- 这些是人眼睛吗？  - 放回去
- Are these human eyes? - Put those back!

1104
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,510
- 它们在微波炉里  - 是个实验
- They were in the microwave. - It's an experiment.

1105
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,950
继续搜，伙计们
Keep looking, guys.

1106
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,410
或者你可以用适当的方式帮我们，我就让他们停下
Or you could help us properly, and I'll stand them down.

1107
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,390
- 这真幼稚  - 对，我在跟个孩子打交道
- This is childish. - Well, I'm dealing with a child.

1108
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,770
夏洛克，这是我们的案件
Sherlock, this is ourcase.

1109
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,530
我让你参与，但你不能走开自己干
I'm letting you in, but you do not go off on your own.

1110
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:21,430
清楚了吗
Clear?

1111
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,720
否则怎样？所以你就设个假缉毒行动来欺压我？
Or what? So you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me?

1112
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:26,470
要是找到什么，就不是假的了
It stops being pretend if we find anything.

1113
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,950
我是清白的
I am clean!

1114
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,130
- 你的公寓呢？整个公寓？  - 我连烟都不抽
- Is your flat? All of it? - I don't even smoke.

1115
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,410
我也不抽
Neither do I.

1116
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:37,910
我们合作吧
So let's work together.

1117
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,970
- 我们找到了瑞琪儿  - 她是谁？
- We've found Rachel. - Who is she?

1118
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,580
詹妮弗·威尔逊的独女
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

1119
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,800
她女儿？
Her daughter?

1120
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,780
她为何写下女儿的名字？为什么？
Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?

1121
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,960
管她呢  我们找到了箱子
Never mind that, we found the case.

1122
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,310
据某人说，凶手拿着箱子
According to someone, the murderer has the case,

1123
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,260
而我们发现它在我们最喜欢的精神病人手里
and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath.

1124
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,410
不是精神病人，安德森
Not a psychopath, Andersen.

1125
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,510
我是高智商反社会人格，做好调查
I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.

1126
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,320
你需要带瑞琪儿来问询，我要问她
You need to bring Rachel in to question her. I need to question her.

1127
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,450
- 她死了   - 好极了，如何，何时以及为何？
- She's dead. - Excellent. How, when and why?

1128
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,750
是否有联系？一定有
Is there a connection? There has to be.

1129
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,230
哦，我很怀疑，因为她已死了14年
Well, I doubt it, since she's been dead for 14 years.

1130
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,600
严格来说 她从未活过
Technically, she was never alive.

1131
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,750
瑞琪儿是詹妮弗·威尔逊的死胎女儿，14年前
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

1132
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,510
哦  那
Oh, that's...

1133
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:17,350
那不对，怎么…
...that's not right. How...

1134
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,190
她为何那么做？为什么？
Why would she do that? Why?

1135
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,650
她为什么临死一刻想到女儿？
Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments?

1136
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,890
是啊，反社会，这下我看到了
Yep - sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

1137
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,390
她不是在想自己的女儿
She didn't think about her daughter.

1138
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,780
她刻出这个名字，在地板上，用指甲
She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails.

1139
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,000
她快死了，这很费劲，会很痛苦
She was dying. It took effort, it would have hurt.

1140
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,580
你说过受害人都是自行服毒
You said that the victims all took the poison themselves,

1141
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,670
他让他们服毒的
that he makes them take it.

1142
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,350
也许他...我不知道...跟他们说了什么
Well, maybe he...I don't know, talks to them.

1143
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,780
也许他以某种方式利用了她女儿的死
Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.

1144
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,020
可那是陈年旧事了，她为何还会心烦？
But that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?

1145
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,110
不好吗？
Not good?

1146
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,150
有点不好，对
Bit not good, yeah.

1147
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,740
如果你快死了  如果你被人谋杀
If you were dying, if you'd been murdered,

1148
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,470
在你最后那几分钟里 你会说什么？
in your very last few seconds, what would you say?

1149
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,390
- “求你，主啊，让我活着”  - 运用你的想象力
- "Please, God, let me live." - Use your imagination!

1150
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,990
我没必要
I don't have to.

1151
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,250
对，但如果你很聪明呢，真的很聪明
Yeah, but if you were clever, really clever.

1152
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,570
詹妮弗·威尔逊操纵那么多情人，她很聪明
Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers - she was clever.

1153
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,230
她是想告诉我们什么
She's trying to tell us something.

1154
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,730
不是门铃在响吗？你的出租车来了，夏洛克
Isn't the doorbell working? Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

1155
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,360
我没叫出租车，走开
I didn't order a taxi. Go away.

1156
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,490
哦，亲爱的 他们弄得真乱
Oh, dear. They're making such a mess.

1157
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,110
- 他们在找什么？ - 这是缉毒行动，哈德森夫人
- What are they looking for? - It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

1158
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,100
但那些只是治疗我臀部的，是草药…
But they're just for my hip. They're herbal soothers...

1159
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:22,340
闭嘴，所有人闭嘴！别动，别说话，别呼吸
Shut up, everybody shut up! Don't move, don't speak, don't breathe.

1160
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,650
我在设法思考！安德森转过脸去，你碍到我了
I'm trying to think. Anderson, face the other way. You're putting me off.

1161
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,390
- 什么？我的脸...  - 大家保持安静
- What? My face is - Everybody quiet and still.

1162
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,650
- 安德森，转过背去  - 老天在上
- Anderson, turn your back. - Oh, for God's sake!

1163
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,380
转过去，马上，拜托
Your back, now, please!

1164
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,530
- 来吧 快思考  - 你的出租车怎么办？
- Come on, think. Quick! - What about your taxi?

1165
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,700
哈德森夫人
Mrs Hudson!

1166
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,710
她真聪明 聪明 没错
She was clever. Clever, yes!

1167
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,870
她比你们都聪明，可她死了
She's cleverer than you lot and she's dead.

1168
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,150
你们明白了吗 你们搞懂没？
Do you see? Do you get it?

1169
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,810
她没有丢失手机，她根本没丢，她安插给他的
She didn't lose her phone, she never lost it. She planted it on him.

1170
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,000
当她下车的时候
When she got out of the car,

1171
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,750
她知道她要死了
she knew that she was going to her death.

1172
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,060
她留下手机，是为了引导我们找到凶手
She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.

1173
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,790
- 但怎么找？  - 你说什么怎么找？
- But how? - What do you mean, how?

1174
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,510
瑞琪儿
Rachel!

1175
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,390
还不明白吗？瑞琪儿
Don't you see? Rachel!

1176
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,320
瞧瞧你们，全都那么茫然
Look at you lot. You're all so vacant.

1177
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,620
不当我是不是很好？一定很放松吧
Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing.

1178
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,850
- 瑞琪儿不是人名  - 那它是什么？
- Rachel is not a name. - Then what is it?

1179
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,860
约翰，箱子上有个名牌
John, on the luggage, there's a label.

1180
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,310
电邮地址
E-mail address.

1181
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,830
jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk
Er, jenny.Pink@mephone.Org.Uk.

1182
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,730
噢，我反应太慢了，她没有笔记本电脑
Ah, I've been too slow. She didn't have a laptop,

1183
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,350
说明她是用手机谈生意
which means she did her business on her phone.

1184
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,190
所以是智能手机，能使用电邮
So it's a smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

1185
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,830
所以有个网页能登她的账户
So there was a website for her account.

1186
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,410
用户名是她的电邮地址
The username is her e-mail address,

1187
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,140
都齐了，现在密码是...
and all together now, the password is...?

1188
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,370
- 瑞琪儿  - 我们能读她的邮件，那又如何？
- Rachel. - So we can read her e-mails. So what?

1189
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,800
安德森，别说出声来
Anderson, don't talk out loud.

1190
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:43,310
整条街的智商都被你拉低了
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

1191
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,990
我们远不止能读她的电子邮件
We can do much more than just read her emails.

1192
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,700
这是智能手机，装有GPS
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

1193
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,910
意味着如果丢了，你可以在线定位它
Which means if you lose it, you can locate it online.

1194
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:51,100
她把我们直接引导到杀死她的人
She's leading us directly to the man who killed her.

1195
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,060
- 除非他扔了手机  - 我们知道他没扔
- Unless he got rid of it. - We know he didn't.

1196
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,950
来啊，来啊，快点
Come on, come on. Quickly!

1197
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,550
夏洛克，亲爱的，那位出租司机…
Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

1198
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:00,230
哈德森夫人，你是不是该用晚上的那啥药了
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother?

1199
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,420
准备车，弄架直升机，我们得尽快赶去
Get vehicles, get a helicopter. We have to go as fast as we can.

1200
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,880
这个手机电池不会永远持续
This phone battery won't last for ever.

1201
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,550
我们只有地图上的定位点，没有名字
We'll just have a map reference, not a name.

1202
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,600
这是个开始
It's a start!

1203
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:08,550
夏洛克
Sherlock...

1204
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,110
缩小范围，不再是伦敦所有人了
Narrows it down from just anyone in London.

1205
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,430
- 这是我们第一个适当的线索  - 夏洛克
- It's the first proper lead we've had. - Sherlock...

1206
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,010
它在哪里？快，哪里？
Where is it? Quickly, where?

1207
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:17,950
它在…这儿，它在…贝克街221B
It's...here. It's...in 22 1 Baker Street.

1208
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,610
它怎么会在这里？
How can it be here?

1209
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,030
怎么会？
How?

1210
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,110
也许它在箱子里，你带回来的时候就…
Maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it

1211
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,670
掉到什么地方了
fell out somewhere.

1212
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,100
而我没注意到？我？我没注意到？
And I didn't notice it? Me? I didn't notice?

1213
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,000
不管怎样，我们发了短信，他打回电话了
Anyway, we texted him, and he called back.

1214
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,420
伙计们，我们还要在这里找一部手机
Guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here,

1215
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:36,210
是死者的物品
belonged to the victim.

1216
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,350
谁是我们不认识也会信任的人？
Who do we trust, even if we don't know them?

1217
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,990
谁去哪里都不引人注意？
Who passes unnoticed wherever they go?

1218
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,030
谁在人群当中狩猎？
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

1219
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,000
- 夏洛克，你还好吧？  - 什么？
- Sherlock, are you OK? - What...?

1220
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,190
对对，我没事
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

1221
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,320
所以那部手机怎么会在这里？
So, how can the phone be here?

1222
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,390
不知道
Don't know.

1223
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,510
- 我再试试  - 好主意
- I'll try it again. - Good idea.

1224
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,110
你去哪儿？
Where are you going?

1225
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,750
新鲜空气，出去站一会儿，不会太久
Fresh air, just popping outside for a moment. Won't be long.

1226
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,830
- 你确定没事吗？  - 我没事
- Are you sure you're all right? - I'm fine.

1227
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,710
夏洛克·福尔摩斯叫的车
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

1228
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,110
我没有叫出租
I didn't order a taxi.

1229
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:13,310
不代表你不需要一辆
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

1230
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,230
你就是那个的哥
You're the cabbie.

1231
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,110
停在诺森伯兰街外面的那个
The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.

1232
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,230
是你  不是你的乘客
It was you. Not your passenger.

1233
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,130
瞧，从来没人想过的哥
See? No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

1234
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,430
就像你隐形了
It's like you're invisible.

1235
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,310
就是个后脑勺而已
Just the back of an 'ead.

1236
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,990
连环杀手的特有优势
Proper advantage for a serial killer.

1237
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,270
- 这是在认罪吗？  - 哦，是的
- Is this a confession? - Oh, yeah.

1238
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,510
我另外再告诉你
I'll tell you what else...

1239
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,670
要是你现在叫警察，我不会跑
If you call the coppers now, I won't run.

1240
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,250
我会好好待着，他们可以拿下我，我保证
I'll sit quiet, and they can take me down, I promise.

1241
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,400
为什么？
Why?

1242
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,210
因为你不会那样做
Cos you're not going to do that.

1243
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:56,710
我不会吗？
Am I not?

1244
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,470
我没有杀那四个人，福尔摩斯先生
I didn't kill those four people, Mr Holmes.

1245
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,630
我跟他们交谈
I spoke to 'em...

1246
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,790
他们就自杀了
and they killed themselves.

1247
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,510
如果你现在叫警察，我跟你保证一件事
If you get the coppers now, I'll promise you one thing.

1248
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,230
我永远不会告诉你我说了什么
I will never tell you what I said.

1249
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,250
但也再不会有人死了
No-one else will die, though,

1250
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,990
我相信他们接受这结果
and I believe they call that a result.

1251
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,030
而你将永远不会明白那些人怎么死的
And you won't ever understand how those people died.

1252
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,430
你关心的是哪种结果呢？
What kind of result do you care about?

1253
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,110
要是我想要了解
If I wanted to understand...

1254
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,750
我该怎么做？
...what would I do?

1255
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,390
让我载你一程
Let me take you for a ride.

1256
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,590
让你也把我杀了？
So you can kill me too?

1257
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,790
我不想杀你，福尔摩斯先生
I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

1258
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,990
我会跟你谈谈
I'm going to talk to you...

1259
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,400
然后你就会杀死自己
...and then you're going to kill yourself.

1260
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:21,980
他刚上了一辆出租车
He just got in a cab...

1261
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:24,510
是夏洛克，他刚坐出租车走了
It's Sherlock. He just drove off in a cab.

1262
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,210
我跟你说过，他常这样
I told you, he does that.

1263
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,730
又特么走了
He bloody left again.

1264
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,410
我们在浪费时间
We're wasting our time!

1265
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,830
我在打那个手机，铃声在响
I'm...calling the phone, it's ringing out.

1266
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,740
既然响铃，它就不在这里
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

1267
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,180
我再试试搜索
I'll try the search again.

1268
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,210
这还重要吗？有半点用吗
Does it matter? Does any of it?

1269
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,000
他就是个疯子 他总是让你失望
He's just a lunatic and he'll always let you down.

1270
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:55,230
你在浪费时间 我们大家的时间
And you're wasting your time. All our time.

1271
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,670
好了，大家
OK, everybody...

1272
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,230
收工
done here.

1273
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,430
你怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

1274
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,310
我认出了你
Oh, I recognised you.

1275
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,910
就在我看见你追踪我的车时
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

1276
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,990
夏洛克·福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes!

1277
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,470
有人跟我警告过你
I was warned about you.

1278
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,310
我也去过你的网站，精彩的东西，爱死了
I've been on your website too. Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

1279
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,590
谁跟你警告过我？
Who warned you about me?

1280
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,700
只是一个注意你的人
Just someone out there who's noticed.

1281
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,190
谁？
Who?

1282
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:40,990
谁会注意我？
Who would notice me?

1283
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,150
- 你太谦虚了，福尔摩斯先生  - 我真不是
- You're too modest, Mr Holmes. - I'm really not.

1284
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,510
你有个粉丝呢
Got yourself a fan.

1285
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,700
多告诉我一点
Tell me more.

1286
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,910
你只能知道这么多了
That's all you're going to know.

1287
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,030
这辈子里
In this lifetime.

1288
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,750
他为什么那么做？他为什么必须走？
Why did he do that? Why did he have to leave?

1289
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,900
你比我更了解他
You know him better than I do.

1290
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,110
我认识他五年了  但还是不了解他
I've known him for five years and, no, I don't.

1291
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,270
那你为何容忍他？
So why do you put up with him?

1292
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:09,230
因为我绝望没招了，这就是原因
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

1293
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,870
也因为夏洛克·福尔摩斯是个了不起的人
And because Sherlock Holmes is a great man,

1294
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,590
而且我想，有一天，如果我们非常非常幸运的话
and I think one day, if we're very, very lucky,

1295
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,870
他甚至可能成为个好人
he might even be a good one.

1296
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,270
我们在哪里？
Where are we?

1297
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,700
你知道伦敦的每一条街道  你很清楚我们在哪里
You know every street in London. You know exactly where we are.

1298
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,550
罗兰克尔成人教育学院
Roland-Kerr Further Education College.

1299
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,410
- 为什么来这儿？  - 这儿开着
- Why here? - It's open.

1300
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,770
清洁工在里面
Cleaners are in.

1301
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,870
当的哥有一个好处…
One thing about being a cabbie -

1302
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,650
你总是知道某个僻静理想的杀人地点
you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder.

1303
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:01,710
我惊讶我们没有更多人拓展这业务
I'm surprised more of us don't branch out.

1304
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,710
你就跟受害者走进去？怎么办到？
And you just walk your victims in? How?

1305
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,230
哦…乏味
Oh... Dull.

1306
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,910
别担心，好戏在后头呢
Don't worry. It gets better.

1307
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,750
你不能用枪逼着人自杀吧
You can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint.

1308
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,190
我没有
I don't.

1309
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,600
比那个强多了
It's much better than that.

1310
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,110
对你不用这个，因为你会跟来
Don't need this with you. Cos you'll follow me.

1311
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,030
你看如何？
Well, what do you think?

1312
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,710
随你喜欢了
It's up to you.

1313
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,110
你是要死在这里的人
You're the one who's going to die here.

1314
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,750
不，我不是
No, I'm not.

1315
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,270
他们都这么说
That's what they all say.

1316
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,830
咱俩聊聊吧？
Shall we talk?

1317
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,150
有点冒险，对吗
Bit risky, wasn't it?

1318
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,070
从半打警察眼皮子底下把我带走
Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen.

1319
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,310
他们没那么蠢
They're not that stupid.

1320
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,630
而且哈德森太太会记得你
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

1321
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,550
你把这叫做冒险？  不...
You call that a risk? Nah...

1322
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,710
这才叫冒险
This...is a risk.

1323
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,600
哦，我喜欢这一点
Oh, I like this bit.

1324
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,870
因为你还没搞懂，对吧
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

1325
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,870
你马上就会明白
But you're about to.

1326
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,550
我只需这样…
I just have to do this...

1327
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,390
没想到这个，对吧
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

1328
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,990
你会喜欢这个的
Oh, you're gonna love this.

1329
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,790
- 喜欢什么？  - 夏洛克·福尔摩斯，看看你
- Love what? - Sherlock Holmes...look at you!

1330
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,680
活生生的在这里
Here in the flesh.

1331
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,500
你那个网站，你的粉丝给我讲了
That website of yours, your fan told me about it.

1332
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:39,990
我的粉丝？
My fan?

1333
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,150
你那么杰出
You are brilliant.

1334
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,990
你是个特有的天才
You are a proper genius.

1335
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,750
演绎科学，那东西...
The Science Of Deduction. Now, that...

1336
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,800
是特出的想法
is proper thinking.

1337
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,370
我们就来说说，人们为什么不会思考？
Between you and me sitting here, why can't people think?

1338
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,230
这不让你发疯吗？
Don't it make you mad?

1339
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:02,990
为什么人们就不能思考一下呢
Why can't people just think?

1340
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,350
哦，我明白了，这么说你也是个特有的天才
Oh, I see... So you're a proper genius too.

1341
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,550
看起来不像吧
Don't look it, do I?

1342
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,630
可笑的小男人，开着出租
Funny little man driving a cab.

1343
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,830
不过你马上就能了解更多了
But you'll know better in a minute.

1344
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,910
很大机会 这是你一生所知的最后一件事
Chances are it'll be the last thing you ever know.

1345
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:26,800
好吧，两个瓶子，解释下
OK, two bottles. Explain.

1346
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,410
一个无毒瓶  一个有毒瓶
There's a good bottle and a bad bottle.

1347
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:32,110
你拿了无毒瓶里的药丸，你活
You take the pill from the good bottle, you live.

1348
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:36,230
你拿了有毒瓶里的药丸...你死
You take the pill from the bad bottle...you die.

1349
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,980
- 两个瓶子当然完全一样  - 各个方面
- Both bottles are of course identical. - In every way.

1350
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,990
- 但你知道哪个是哪个  - 我当然知道
- And you know which is which. - Of course I know.

1351
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:41,930
而我不知道
But I don't.

1352
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:44,810
你知道就不是游戏了  是你来选
Wouldn't be a game if you knew - you're the one who chooses.

1353
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,000
我为什么要选？我什么也得不到
Why should I? I've got nothing to go on.

1354
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,750
我有什么好处？
What's in it for me?

1355
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,550
我还没告诉你最精彩的部分呢
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

1356
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,400
不管你选哪个瓶子
Whatever bottle you choose,

1357
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,430
我将拿起另一瓶里的药丸
I take the pill from the other one.

1358
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,870
然后  我们一起...
And then together...

1359
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,430
把我们的药吃下去
we take our medicine.

1360
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,470
我不作弊，由你来选
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

1361
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,000
你选剩下哪个药丸我都吃掉
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

1362
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,310
没想到这一手，是吧，福尔摩斯先生？
Didn't expect that, did you, Mr Holmes?

1363
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,630
这就是你对其他人的做法
This is what you did to the rest of them,

1364
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,150
- 你给他们一个选择？ - 现在我给你一个
- you gave them a choice? - And now I'm giving you one.

1365
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,330
你不用着急
You take your time.

1366
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,300
集中精神
Get yourself together.

1367
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,860
我要你尽情游戏
I want your best game.

1368
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,600
这不是游戏，这是机率
It's not a game, it's chance.

1369
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:32,230
我玩了4次，我还活着
I've played four times. I'm alive.

1370
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,150
这不是机率，福尔摩斯先生，这是下棋
It's not chance, Mr Holmes - it's chess.

1371
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,350
这是一局棋，只走一步
It's a game of chess, with one move...

1372
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,430
一个幸存者
...and one survivor.

1373
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,190
而这…这个…
And this...this...

1374
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,030
就是那一步
is the move.

1375
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,590
我刚给你的是无毒的 还是有毒的瓶子？
Did I just give you the good bottle or the bad bottle?

1376
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:02,910
你可以选任何一个
You can choose either one.

1377
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:09,120
不，雷斯垂德探长，我得和他谈谈
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade - I need to speak to him.

1378
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:11,170
很重要，紧急状况
It's important. It's an emergency.

1379
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,430
呃，这里左转，请你左转
Er, left here, please. Left here...

1380
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,470
你准备好了吗，福尔摩斯先生？
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

1381
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,810
准备好下棋了吗？
Ready to play?

1382
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:31,440
下什么？ 这是50比50的机率
Play what? It's a 50:50 chance.

1383
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,950
你不是和数字下，而是和我下
You're not playing the numbers - you're playing me.

1384
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,070
我刚才给你无毒药丸还是有毒药丸呢
Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill?

1385
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,000
这是诈唬呢？
Is it a bluff

1386
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,000
还是双重诈唬？
or a double bluff?

1387
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:44,500
还是三重诈唬？
Or a triple bluff?

1388
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,440
仍然不过是机率
It's still just chance.

1389
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,400
连赢四个人？ 这不是机率
Four people, in a row? It's not chance.

1390
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:49,070
- 运气  - 是天赋
- Luck. - It's genius!

1391
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,000
我知道人们怎么思考
I know how people think.

1392
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:55,230
我知道人们怎么考虑我的想法
I know how people think I think.

1393
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,830
我能全看透，就像脑子里有一张地图
I can see it all like a map inside my head.

1394
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,650
人人都那么蠢，连你也是
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

1395
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,960
或者，也许上帝就是偏爱我
Or maybe God just loves me.

1396
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,870
不管怎样，你是个浪费生命的的哥
Either way, you're wasted as a cabbie.

1397
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,110
所以….
So...

1398
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,230
你四次冒生命危险，只为杀死陌生人，为什么？
...you risked your life four times just to kill strangers - why?

1399
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,800
该下棋了
Time to play.

1400
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:31,700
我正在下呢，该我走棋了
Oh, I am playing. This is my turn.

1401
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,620
你的左耳后面有剃须膏沫
There's shaving foam behind your left ear.

1402
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,870
没人给你指出来
Nobody's pointed it out to you.

1403
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,420
痕迹说明以前也有过
Traces of where it's happened before,

1404
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,210
所以明显你是一个人住，没人告诉你
so obviously you live on your own there's no-one to tell you.

1405
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,720
但还有一张孩子们的照片
But there's a photograph of children.

1406
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:44,510
孩子们的母亲却从照片里裁掉了
The children's mother's been cut out of the picture

1407
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,310
如果她死了，那还会留在里面
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

1408
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,350
照片是旧的，但相框很新
The photograph's old, but the frame's new.

1409
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,710
你想念你的孩子们，却无法见到他们
You think of your children, but you don't get to see them.

1410
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,990
分居的父亲
Estranged father.

1411
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,870
她带走了孩子
She took the kids,

1412
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:58,130
但你仍然爱他们，仍然心痛
but you still love them, and it still hurts.

1413
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:00,750
哦，还有呢
Ah, but there's more.

1414
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,630
你的衣服，最近才洗过
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

1415
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,630
但你穿的每一样东西，至少有3年那么旧
but everything you're wearing is at least...three years old?

1416
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:11,350
保留现状 但对前途无计划
Keeping up appearances, but not planning ahead.

1417
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,350
而你又在这里搞神风谋杀，这是为何？
And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree. What's that about?

1418
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,990
哦，三年前…他们是那时候告诉你的吧？
three years ago. Is that when they told you?

1419
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,190
告诉我什么？
Told me what?

1420
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,440
- 说你是将死之人  - 你也是
- That you're a dead man walking. - So are you.

1421
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,050
反正你时日不多了，我说得对吗？
You don't have long, though. Am I right?

1422
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,510
动脉瘤  就在这里面
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

1423
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:42,000
任何一口气都可能是我最后一口
Any breath could be my last.

1424
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,730
就因为你要死了，你就连杀四个人
And because you're dying, you've just murdered four people.

1425
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,710
我可比那四个人活得久
I've outlived four people.

1426
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,150
对于得动脉瘤的人，那可是最高兴的事了
That's the most fun you can have with an aneurism.

1427
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,710
不...不 还有别的
No... No, there's something else.

1428
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,950
你不会因为痛苦而杀四个人
You didn't just kill four people because you're bitter.

1429
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,750
痛苦是一种麻痹
Bitterness is a paralytic.

1430
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:04,790
爱才是更为歹毒的动力
Love is a much more vicious motivator.

1431
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,250
这和你的孩子有某种关联
Somehow, this is about your children.

1432
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:15,350
- 你厉害  - 但怎么关联呢
- You are good, in't ya? - But how?

1433
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,590
等我死了，他们得不到多少，我的孩子们
When I die, they won't get much, my kids.

1434
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,960
开出租车赚不了多少钱
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

1435
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,170
连环杀人也没有
Or serial killing.

1436
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,330
你会吃惊的
You'd be surprised.

1437
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,010
那就惊惊我
Surprise me.

1438
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,900
我有个赞助商
I have a sponsor.

1439
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,850
你有什么？
You have a what?

1440
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:36,870
我每取一条命，就有一笔钱给我的孩子
For every life I take, money goes to my kids.

1441
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,700
我杀得越多…他们就越宽裕
The more I kill... the better off they'll be.

1442
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,830
看吧  比你想象的好得多
You see? It's nicer than you think.

1443
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,390
有谁会赞助一个连环杀手？
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

1444
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,110
谁会是夏洛克·福尔摩斯的粉丝？
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

1445
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:55,430
你不是唯一欣赏高明谋杀的人
You're not the only one to enjoy a good murder.

1446
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,850
外面还有一些人 跟你一样
There's others out there just like you,

1447
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,630
不过你只是一介凡人
except you're just a man.

1448
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,270
而他们却远不止如此
And they're so much more than that.

1449
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,710
什么意思…
What do you mean...

1450
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,870
不止是一个人？
more than a man?

1451
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:11,960
一个组织…什么？
An organisation...what?

1452
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:14,900
有一个名字，没人说出来
There's a name that no-one says.

1453
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,990
我也不会说的
And I'm not going to say it either.

1454
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,790
现在，闲聊够了
Now, enough chatter.

1455
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:25,550
该选择了
Time to choose.

1456
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,270
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1457
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,050
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1458
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,430
要是我两个都不选呢？我可以直接走人
What if I don't choose either? I could just walk out of here.

1459
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,350
你可以选50%的机会
You can take a 50:50 chance,

1460
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,390
或让我射爆你的头
or I can shoot you in the head.

1461
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,130
够好笑的
Funnily enough,

1462
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,310
至今没人选这个选项
no-one's ever gone for that option.

1463
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,470
那我选枪 请吧
I'll have the gun, please.

1464
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,110
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

1465
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,790
肯定的  就选枪
Definitely. The gun.

1466
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,950
你不想给朋友打个电话？
You don't want to phone a friend

1467
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,010
选枪
The gun.

1468
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,990
看见真枪我认得出来
I know a real gun when I see one.

1469
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,150
- 其他人都没发现  - 无疑
- None of the others did. - Clearly.

1470
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,550
好了，这一切非常有趣
Well, this has been very interesting.

1471
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,150
期待法庭上见
I look forward to the court case.

1472
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,150
你走之前，问一下你想清楚了吗？
Just before you go, did you figure it out?

1473
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,470
哪一瓶是无毒的？
Which one's the good bottle?

1474
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,910
当然，小孩把戏
Course. Child's play.

1475
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,990
那是哪一个呢？
Well, which one, then?

1476
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,040
你会挑哪个呢？
Which one would you have picked?

1477
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,190
我只想知道自己能否打败你
Just so I know whether I could have beaten you.

1478
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,070
来吧
Come on!

1479
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,950
开始游戏吧
Play the game.

1480
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:08,980
有意思
Oh! Interesting.

1481
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,070
你怎么想？
So what do you think?

1482
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,050
来吧？
Shall we?

1483
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,190
真的  你怎么想的？
Really...what do you think?

1484
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,830
你能打败我吗？
Can you beat me?

1485
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,030
你是否够聪明
Are you clever enough...

1486
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:37,950
可以赌上性命？
to bet your life?

1487
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,270
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1488
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,590
我打赌你很无聊  不是吗
I bet you get bored, don't you?

1489
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,470
我知道你无聊
I know you do.

1490
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,180
你这样的人 如此聪明
A man like you. So clever.

1491
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:06,810
但若不能证明，聪明又有何意义呢？
But what's the point of being clever if you can't prove it?

1492
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,470
仍旧是瘾君子
Still the addict.

1493
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,830
但这个 这才是真正让你上瘾的东西
But this...this is what you're really addicted to.

1494
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,150
你定会竭尽全力
You'll do anything...

1495
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,450
全力以赴，避免无聊
...anything at all, to stop being bored.

1496
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,150
你现在不无聊了，对吧？
You're not bored now, are ya?

1497
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,000
这不错吧
Isn't it good?

1498
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,190
我对了吗？
Was I right?

1499
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,950
我对了，是吧？
I was, wasn't I?

1500
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,430
我刚才挑对了吗？
Did I get it right?

1501
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,190
好吧  那就告诉我
OK...tell me this.

1502
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,910
你的赞助者，他是谁？
Your sponsor. Who was it?

1503
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,990
那个跟你提起我的人  我的粉丝
The one who told you about me, my fan.

1504
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,870
我要名字
I want a name.

1505
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:06,390
不
No...

1506
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,550
你要死了，但还有时间折磨你
You're dying, but there's still time to hurt you.

1507
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:12,230
给我…名字
Give me...A name.

1508
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,750
名字  快说
A name! Now!

1509
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,910
名字
The name!

1510
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,670
莫里亚蒂
Moriarty!

1511
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,820
为什么给我毛毯？
Why have I got this blanket?

1512
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,120
他们老是给我披这条毛毯
They keep putting this blanket on me.

1513
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:50,680
- 对，为防你受惊吓  - 我没有受惊
- Yeah, it's for shock. - I'm not in shock.

1514
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,510
对，但有人要拍照片
Yeah, but some of the guys want to take photographs.

1515
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:57,090
那个枪手，没有迹象吗？
So, the shooter - no sign?

1516
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,040
我们赶到前就消失了
Cleared off before we got here.

1517
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:01,200
不过我料想那种人会有很多敌人
But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose.

1518
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:03,080
其中有人可能正在追杀他 不过
One of them could have been following him, but...

1519
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,030
我们现在毫无头绪
we've got nothing to go on.

1520
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,070
哦，我可不这么想
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1521
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,150
那好，告诉我
OK. Give me.

1522
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:14,150
他们从墙上挖出的子弹，来自手枪
The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun.

1523
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,530
那种距离外的致命一击，从那种武器发射
A kill shot over that distance, from that kind of a weapon,

1524
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:19,310
那一枪很出色，你们要找的不单是个神枪手，是个战士
that's a crack shot. You're looking for not just a marksman, a fighter.

1525
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,710
他的手必须纹丝不动
His hands couldn't have shaken at all,

1526
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,260
所以很清楚他习惯于暴力
so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.

1527
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,620
然而他等到我面临直接危险才开火
He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, though

1528
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:25,940
很强的道德原则
so strong moral principle.

1529
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,620
你找的这人
You're looking for a man

1530
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:30,350
或许有军队服役的历史 以及...
probably with a history of military service and...

1531
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,910
钢铁般的神经
nerves of steel...

1532
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,030
其实 你猜怎么？ 别管我说的
Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.

1533
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,920
- 啥？  - 别管那些话
- Sorry? - Ignore all of that.

1534
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:45,110
- 那只是…受惊后的胡说  - 你去哪儿？
- It's just the, er...the shock talking. - Where are you going?

1535
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,140
我得去聊聊租金
I just need to...talk about the...the rent.

1536
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:49,540
- 我还有几个问题呢  - 现在吗  我受惊了
- I've still got questions. - Oh, what now?! I'm in shock

1537
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,630
你看，我披着毛毯呢
look, I've got a blanket.

1538
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,910
- 夏洛克  - 而且
- Sherlock! - And...

1539
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,950
我刚帮你抓了连环杀手
I just caught you a serial killer...

1540
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:56,050
多多少少吧
more or less.

1541
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,990
好吧，我们明天找你，你走吧
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow. Off you go.

1542
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:12,470
嗯，多诺万警佐，刚才解释了…
Erm...Sergeant Donovan's...just been explaining...

1543
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:15,000
所有事情，两颗药丸…
everything. Two pills...

1544
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,310
吓人的事，对吧？ 吓人
Dreadful business, isn't it? Dreadful.

1545
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:20,520
好枪法
Good shot.

1546
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,790
对对，一定是的，穿过窗户
Yes. Yes, must have been. Through that window.

1547
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,800
你清楚
Well, you'd know.

1548
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,150
得把你手指上的火药灼痕去掉
Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers.

1549
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,590
我认为你不会因此坐牢
I don't suppose you'd serve time for this,

1550
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,730
但我们还是避免上庭吧
but let's avoid the court case.

1551
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:36,030
- 你没事吧  - 对，我当然没事
- Are you all right? - Yes, of course I'm all right.

1552
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,830
- 你刚杀了人  - 是的，我...
- Well, you have just killed a man. - Yes, I...

1553
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,870
那倒是，对吧
That's true, isn't it?

1554
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:46,190
不过他不是个很好的人
But he wasn't a very nice man.

1555
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,630
是呀，他真不算好人，不是吗
No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?

1556
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,550
说白了就是个坏透了的的哥
Frankly, a bloody awful cabbie.

1557
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,610
那倒是，他是个坏的哥
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.

1558
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,230
你该看看他带我们兜了多少路到这里
You should have seen the route he took us to get here.

1559
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:00,140
别闹，我们不能笑 这是罪案现场，别闹
Stop! We can't giggle, it's a crime scene. Stop it.

1560
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:02,470
- 是你开的枪  - 你声音小点
- You're the one who shot him. - Keep your voice down!

1561
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,030
- 抱歉  他是太紧张了  - 抱歉
- Sorry, it's just, erm...nerves, I think. - Sorry.

1562
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:09,000
你不会真要吞那该死的药片，对吧？
You were going to take that damn pill, weren't you?

1563
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,310
当然不会
Course I wasn't.

1564
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:13,310
拖延时间而已，知道你会出现
Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.

1565
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,950
不，你不知道
No, you didn't.

1566
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,910
你就是这么找刺激的，对吧
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it?

1567
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,710
冒生命危险证明自己聪明
You risk your life to prove you're clever.

1568
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:20,010
我干嘛这么做？
Why would I do that?

1569
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,610
因为你是个笨蛋
Because you're an idiot.

1570
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,790
- 晚饭？  - 饿死了
- Dinner? - Starving.

1571
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:28,670
贝克街尽头，有家不错的中餐馆，开到凌晨两点
End of Baker Street, there's a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

1572
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,360
中餐馆的好坏能从门把底部三分之一看出来
You can tell a good Chinese by the bottom third of the door handle.

1573
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:35,110
夏洛克，是他，我跟你提过的那个人
Sherlock...that's him, that's the man I was talking to you about.

1574
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,000
我很清楚他是谁
I know exactly who that is.

1575
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,270
好啊…又破了一个案件？
So...another case cracked.

1576
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,790
多么热心公益呀
How very public-spirited.

1577
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,500
虽然那不是你真实的动机，对吧
Though that's never really your motivation, is it?

1578
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,530
你来这里干嘛？
What are you doing here?

1579
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,390
一如既往，我关心你
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

1580
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,790
对，我已经听到你的“关心”了
Yes, I've been hearing about your "Concern".

1581
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,510
总是如此咄咄逼人
Always so aggressive.

1582
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:56,530
你从没想过你我是一边的吗？
Did it never occur to you that you and I belong on the same side?

1583
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,510
说来奇怪…没有
Oddly enough...no.

1584
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,590
我们的共同点比你愿意相信的要多
We have more in common than you'd like to believe.

1585
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:04,570
咱们之间的这点不和 只不过是孩子气
This petty feud between us is simply childish.

1586
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:05,900
有人会因此难受
People will suffer.

1587
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:08,550
你知道这总是让老妈烦心
And you know how it always upset Mummy.

1588
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,270
我让她烦心？
I upset her?

1589
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:13,590
我？
Me?

1590
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,950
让她烦心的不是我，麦克罗夫特
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

1591
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,450
不 不  等等
No. No, wait...

1592
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,750
老妈？谁的老妈？
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

1593
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,750
母亲，我们的母亲
Mother. Our mother.

1594
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,000
这是我哥哥，麦克罗夫特
This is my brother, Mycroft.

1595
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:24,870
又发福了
Putting on weight again?

1596
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,270
- 实际上，减肥了  - 他是你哥？
- Losing it, in fact. - He's your brother?

1597
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,230
当然是我哥
Course he's my brother.

1598
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,750
- 那他不是…  - 不是什么？
- So he's not... - Not what?

1599
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,530
不知道…犯罪主脑？
I don't know...criminal mastermind?

1600
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,870
也差不多
Close enough.

1601
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:39,950
老天爷呀
For goodness' sake,

1602
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,030
我在英国政府里官居末职
I occupy a minor position in the British Government.

1603
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,120
他就是英国政府
He is the British Government,

1604
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:47,920
当他不忙于英国秘密机构或中情局的副业时
when he's not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis.

1605
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,220
晚安，麦克罗夫特
Good evening, Mycroft.

1606
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,500
尽量别在我到家之前发动一场战争
Try not to start a war before I get home

1607
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:53,700
你知道那对交通有何影响的
you know what it does for the traffic.

1608
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,000
所以，你说关心他的时候
So, when you say you're concerned about him,

1609
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,280
你是真的关心他？
you actually are concerned?

1610
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,870
是啊，当然
Yes, of course.

1611
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,750
真是小孩子的不和吗？
It actually is a childish feud?

1612
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,340
他一向如此愤愤不平
He's always been so resentful.

1613
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,590
你可以想象圣诞晚餐的情形
You can imagine the Christmas dinners.

1614
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,390
是啊
Yeah

1615
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,490
不，天，不能
No... God, no.

1616
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,550
我最好还是…又见面了
I'd better, erm... Hello again.

1617
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,500
- 你好  - 我们今晚早些时候见过
- Hello. - We met earlier on this evening.

1618
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,630
- 那好，晚安  - 晚安，华生医生
- OK. Good night. - Good night, Dr Watson.

1619
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,440
走  吃点心去
So, dim sum.Mmm!

1620
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,180
我总能猜到幸运饼写什么
I can always predict the fortune cookies.

1621
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,340
- 不，不可能  - 差不多
- No, you can't. - Almost can.

1622
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:34,870
不过你真中过枪
You did get shot, though.

1623
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,140
- 什么？  - 在阿富汗  真的受过枪伤
- Sorry? - In Afghanistan. There was an actual wound.

1624
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,670
- 哦对，肩膀上  - 肩膀，我就知道
- Oh. Yeah, shoulder. - Shoulder! I thought so.

1625
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,040
- 不你不知道  - 左肩
- No, you didn't. - The left one.

1626
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,870
- 瞎猜中的  - 我从不瞎猜
- Lucky guess. - I never guess.

1627
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,350
你就是猜的
Yes, you do.

1628
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,990
- 你干嘛这么乐？  - 莫里亚蒂
- What are you so happy about? - Moriarty.

1629
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:50,270
- 莫里亚蒂是什么？  - 一无所知
