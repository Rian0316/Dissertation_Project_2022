00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,400
<i>Previously on desperate housewives.</i>

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,400
<i>Dylan and katherine raised
their profile</i>

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,200
<i>And attracted the attention
of an unwanted admirer.</i>

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,100
<i>Mike made
a surprising request...</i>

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,700
do you think
you can forgive me?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,400
<i>Which brought orson's guilt
to the surface.</i>

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,900
- I'm sorry, mike.
- Oh, you're sleepwalking.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
I'm sorry i ran you over, mike.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
<i>Gaby was learning to deal
with carlos being blind...</i>

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,900
i'm sorry for what
i'm putting you through.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,600
If it for anyone but you,
it wouldn't be worth it.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,800
<i>And lynette worried...</i>

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,600
it's rick's place--
Totally went up in flames.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:45,700
<i>That jealousy could drive tom
to an act of violence.</i>

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>The thing you have
to know about lynette scavo</i>

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,700
<i>Is that she had always trusted
her husband tom,</i>

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,400
<i>Mostly because she could
always tell when he was lying.</i>

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,300
<i>Sometimes he would ask her
to repeat the question...</i>

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
Did i eat... your ice cream?
Is that what you're asking?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,400
<i>Or he would use odd words
he had never used before...</i>

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,600
oh, i think it looks...

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,300
spiffy.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,900
<i>Or his voice
would get higher...</i>

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,500
I guess she's pretty. I mean...

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
i didn't really notice.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,200
<i>Clearly, tom scavo was
at a distinct disadvantage</i>

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
<i>When lying to his wife.</i>

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,900
<i>And on this particular morning,</i>

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
<i>That's exactly what lynette...</i>

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,000
<i>was unting on.</i>

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,800
Whatcha doing?

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,300
I am onesing
for a cup of coffee,

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,100
But the stupid burner
is acting up again.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,700
Need a little caffeine fix?

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
Big-Time.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,400
Too much booze last night.
I'm really draggin'.

37
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,300
The open bar is no longer
your friend, huh?

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,300
Guess not.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,500
<i>But they were pouring
top-Shelf stuff,</i>

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,700
And i couldn't resist.

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,500
Is that where you were during
bree's acceptance speech--

42
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,400
Doing free shots at the bar?

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,900
No. Uh,

44
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,600
I think that's when i snuck out
to the car to listen to the game.

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,800
- You go alone?
- Well,

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,200
I would've invited carlos, except...

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,000
obviously, he can't really
sneak around anymore, so...

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,800
yeah.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,600
I was thinkin',

50
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,200
If anyone asks
about that fire at rick's,

51
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,400
It'd be good if you had someone
to account for where you were.

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Why would it matter?
I didn't start the fire.

53
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,900
Right, right.

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,600
<i>It's just...
if anyone thinks you did,</i>

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,900
It'd be handy if y could
prove them wrong, wouldn't it?

56
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,000
You think i did it.

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
<i>No.</i>

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,400
One stupid brick,
and now i'm an arsonist?

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,200
No, no. Of course not.
It's just,

60
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,000
If the police came here
to ask us about the brick,

61
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,300
<i>They're probably gonna
ask us about the fire,</i>

62
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,100
So you might
wanna be ready.

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Listen to me, lynette.

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
As mad as i have been
at rick,

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,000
I had absolutely nothing
to do with this fire.

66
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
We're fine.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Okay.

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,000
- Good.
- Uh-Huh.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,400
<i>Lynette scavo had always
trusted her husband.</i>

70
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,400

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,100

Well, what did i do?
I wasn't speeding.

85
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,900
There's a construction zone back
there. You failed to slow down.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,500
Are you sure? I didn't
see a sign or anything.

87
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,300
You wanna step out
of the car, please?

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
You're not gonna give me
a ticket, are you?

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,500
My mom will kill me.

90
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,900
Where do you go to school?

91
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,800
Fairview high.

92
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,500
Pretty necklace.

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,200
Oh, thanks.

94
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,100
Listen, i'm really sorry
about the construction zone.

95
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,700
I would have slowed down
if i had seen the sign, i swear.

96
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,400
I'll tell you what.

97
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,600
I'll let you go
with a warning.

98
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,800
Just pay more attention
next time, okay?

99
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Thank you. That's very nice
of you. Thank you.

100
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,200
That's everything,
i guess.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,500
Well, if you forgot something,
you can just come back for it,

102
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,600
Or... you could just
not leave.

103
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,400
Oh, that's so sweet, but...

104
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,400
our house
is livable again--

105
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,800
The downstairs anyway--

106
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,000
And we have imposed
long enough.

107
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,500
Besides, mike is
comingome tonight,

108
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
And you're gonna need
the house to yourselves.

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Well, before you go,
i just want to say that, um...

110
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,700
having you here
these last few weeks--

111
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,500
Susan, i'm just going
across the street.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,000
There's no need to act
like a silent movie heroine.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,300
I know.

114
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,700
I just... i can't stop now.

115
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,300
I broke the seal.

116
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,700
Well, um, as much as i appreciate

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,200
This naked display of emotion,

118
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,000
You know how this sort of thing
makes me uncomfortable.

119
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,300
I can't help it.

120
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,300
My hormones
are in overdrive.

121
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,400
Didn't you get that way
when you were pregnant?

122
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,200
No. Never.

123
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,200
Really? Not even when
you heard an acoustic guitar?

124
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,700
No. Never.

125
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh, i just can't
control myself like that.

126
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,900
Oh, sure, you can.

127
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,100
Whenever i feel my emotions
getting the best of me,

128
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,500
I simply picture
an empty box,

129
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
<i>And i take whatever i'm feeling
and put that in the box,</i>

130
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,500
And then i picture myself
putting the box away

131
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,800
In a big, empty closet
and closing the door.

132
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Then if i have time, i go back

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,900
And open the box and

134
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
Deal with the emotion...

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,700
in private, like a lady.

136
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,500
Thanks.

137
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm gonna try that.

138
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,700
So you don't think
i act like a lady?

139
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,200
Prove me wrong, sweetie.

140
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Prove me wrong.

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,500
All right.

142
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,500
Come on, girl.

143
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,800
Okay, carlos,
here's the harness.

144
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,400
There you are!

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Oh, you must be roxy!

146
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,000
Aren't you the cutest thing! Oh!

147
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, not too close.
It's silk.

148
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,700
Gaby, this is steve. He's the
head trainer at the dog school.

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Ah, nice to meet you.

150
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,900
How much he enjoyed
taking classes with roxy.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Well, they make a great team.

152
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,100
Well, i have got a million questions
about this little lifesaver here.

153
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,300
Okay, shoot.

154
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,300
Okay, hypothetical situation--

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,200
Carlos and i are
sitting on the couch.

156
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,900
I'm doing my nails.
He's whining for the remote.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,500
How do i get roxy
to fetch it for him?

158
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,600
She's serious.

159
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,600
Oh.

160
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,100
Roxy doesn't do that.

161
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,900
Um, her job is to get carlos
from point "a" to point "b"

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,900
As safely as possible.

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,300
I get that, but surely
she's trained to do other stuff,

164
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,800
You know, like find his keys
or turn off the radio

165
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
Or lick up his spills.

166
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,300
Yeah, and after that, she can go
solve crimes with shaggy and the gang.

167
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,700
Don't ve me i saw a collie on tv
who could push a lawn mower.

168
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,800
Do you have one of those?
Gaby, roxy's fantastic.

169
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,000
Really? Well, for a dog
who's supposed to help us,

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,500
She sounds kind of limited.

171
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,700
Sorry, but it's true.

172
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,300
<i>She's not here to help us.
She's here to help me,</i>

173
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,800
Which you would know if you had bothered
to show up to the spouses' orientation.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,300
Well, i'm sorry. I was on my
hands and knees that day,

175
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,700
Scouring the bathroom floor

176
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,900
Because you fused
to pee like a girl.

177
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,900
So...

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
any other questions?

179
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,300
No, it's crystal clear.

180
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,700
Carlos gets
a new best friend,

181
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,600
And i get to check
the sofa for ticks.

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,000
Yay for gaby!

183
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,100
Did i exaggerate?

184
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,700
Actually, you were kin

185
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,700
Oh, it feels good to take
a shower in my own house.

186
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,800
At you doing?

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
In honor of you coming home, we
are making your favorite meal--

188
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,900
Steak and mashed potatoes.

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,400
Oh, that sounds great.
For future reference,

190
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,800
My favorite is
potatoes au gratin. Mmm.

191
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,400
Since when?

192
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Since always.
Since i was 3. Hmm.

193
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,800
You could say "au gratin"
when you were 3?

194
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,400
Oh, it's fine. Susan,
mashed is great, too.

195
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,000
It's not your favorite?

196
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,700
What are you doing?
Excuse me.

197
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,100
I have to put something in a box
and stick it in the closet.

198
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,900
Hormones.

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh. Got it.

200
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,100
Pretty much anything
sets her off these days.

201
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,300
Uh, which is why

202
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,600
I haven't told her...

203
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,700
told her what?
Something wrong?

204
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,500
Well, when bree and orson
were staying with us,

205
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,000
This weird thing happened.

206
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,800
Oh, yeah. Naked orson?
I heard.

207
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,400
Must have been
quite a show.

208
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,500
No,
this was the next night.

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,400
He was sleepwalking, and he said
something kinda strange.

210
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,100
But like i said, he was asleep,
so it's probably nothing.

211
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,200
Julie, what'd he say?

212
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
He said...

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,200
"i'm sorry i ran over mike."

214
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,100
- What?
- It's crazy, right?

215
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Why would
he say something like that?

216
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
He didn't even know you
when that happened.

217
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,100
Yeah, you're right.
It's crazy.

218
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah, that's what i figured.

219
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,600
Okay, well, i'm gonna go check
on mom and make sure she's okay.

220
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,100
We don't need any more drama
in this house.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,400
Yeah, i agree.

222
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,900
How's the move going?

223
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
Need an extra pair of hands?

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,900
No, thanks.
We're almost done.

225
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,300
Okay, well,
i won't get in your way then.

226
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,700
Let me just run something
by you.

227
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
I got a call today from a couple

228
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,800
Who loved
our work on the founder's ball.

229
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,000
- Oh, how sweet.
- Yes,

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,100
And they want to hire us
to do their anniversary party.

231
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,500
Hire us?
But we're not a business.

232
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,300
We could be.
Think about it.

233
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,700
We do the exact same thing
we did at the ball,

234
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,300
Only this time, we walk away
with a big, fat check.

235
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,000
Katherine, need i remind you we
nearly came to blows over floral choices?

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,600
I think it's ourcreative friction
that makes us a great team.

237
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,900
I think it's our creative friction
that nearly caused me to poison you.

238
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
All right, look, bree,??

239
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,200
With adam out of the house,
i really need the money.

240
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,900
I sympathize. I do,
but i have a new baby,

241
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,100
And it's really more work than
i care to take on right now.

242
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,700
I understand.

243
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,100
Guess i'll
just do it myself then.

244
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
Excuse me?

245
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,400
Now did you take pictures of
those table settings you designed?

246
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,400
<i>I'd love to get copies.
The couple raved about them.</i>

247
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,900
Yeah, sure.

248
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,500
You know, i don't
really think it's fair

249
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,200
That you should profit
from something that i designed.

250
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
You're right. It would only be fair
if i asked you to do this with me,

251
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,400
Which i did, and you said no.
So on we go.

252
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,600
I hope you don't mind if i serve
your cinnamon apple crumble.

253
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,100
That is a cherished recipe
from my grandmother.

254
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,500
Well, w it's a cherished recipe
from catering by katherine.

255
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,700
Oh,
i see what's going on here.

256
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,600
This is shameless
emotional blackmail.

257
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,500
And?

258
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,000
And...

259
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,600
it worked beautifully.

260
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,200
I'm in.

261
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,800
No more doggy treats.
She's had enough.

262
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,200
But she's been so good.

263
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,900
Yeah? Well, when she learns
how to make granite sparkle,

264
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,100
She can have more.

265
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm giving her a treat.

266
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Carlos, i said no.

267
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,300
<i>Fine. One treat.</i>

268
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
That's it.
Those things are expensive,

269
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,500
And until your disability kicks in,
we have to tighten our belts.

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
So i guess that means you won't
be getting your hair done anymore.

271
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,200
Carlos, remember
what my fingers look like?

272
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,900
Just picture the middle one
all by itself.

273
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,500
Besides, you're the one
who married me for my looks.

274
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,500
Well, i'm blind now,

275
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,000
So as long as you
use deodorant, i'm good.

276
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,700
Do you have any idea how selfish
you sound right now?

277
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,000
Just because you're blind,
the world should suffer?

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm just saying, you know,
$300 visits to mr. Francois--

279
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,100
Carlos, i'm getting
my hair done! End of discussion!

280
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,000
What are you barking at?
You got your damn treat.

281
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
You know, if we really
want to save money,

282
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,700
You could cut down
on those cuban cigars.

283
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,200
Or... here's a thought.
You could get a job.

284
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,700
Why don't you get a job?

285
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,000
Doing what?

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,600
Put flags on pencils
and sell them at the airport.

287
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,800
<i>What do i care?
Just get out of my kitchen.</i>

288
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,900
What is this about?

289
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,500
I don't know. I guess she
doesn't like it when you smack me.

290
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,800
Oh, so now i can't hit
my own husband in my own house?

291
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Look, we can cut corners??

292
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,300
But i am not gonna skimp when
it comes to my dog.

293
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,000
Roxy, come.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hey, neighbor.

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, mike. Hey.

296
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,200
Welcome back.

297
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,800
You're looking well.

298
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,500
Yeah, well, you know me.

299
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,000
Indestructible.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,700
Yeah.

301
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,100
What you looking for?

302
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
A hammer.

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,100
We're putting
some of the pictures back up.

304
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,400
This it?

305
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,000
Thanks, buddy.

306
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,100
You got a minute?

307
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Uh, actually,
uh, bree's waiting--

308
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,900
Waiting for me.

309
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,500
You said something to julie
when you were sleepwalking.

310
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
I did?

311
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,300
Yeah, and i need you
to clear it up.

312
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Are you the guy
that ran me over?

313
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Mike...

314
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
i'm so sorry.

315
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm so...

316
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
no way.

317
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,100
That mutt is
not sleeping in our bed!

318
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,200
She's clean. It's okay.

319
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,400
No. No, it's not.
I read the pamphlet steve left.

320
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
These dogs are
not allowed on furniture.

321
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,000
I know. I...

322
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,300
i just think it's good for a dog
to sleep with its master.

323
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,600
It helps us bond.

324
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,900
Well, if you ever want
to bond with my boobs again,

325
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,300
You'll get her off!

326
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,100
You're being selfish.

327
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,600
We can
put her at the foot of the bed.

328
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
Carlos, no!

329
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,800
She doesn't like it
when you yell at me, remember?

330
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,300
You're right, baby.
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,700
Let me try it this way.

332
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,500
You listen to me,
you blind son of a bitch.

333
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,800
If you don't get this mangy, 6-Nippled,
cujo wannabe off my satin sheets,

334
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,900
You n't just need a dog
to get around.

335
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,700
You'll need a motorized wheelchair
that you steer with your tongue.

336
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,500
Really?

337
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,000
Carlos, i mean it.

338
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,700
Who's it gonna be--
Me or the dog?

339
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Maternity lingerie--

340
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,600
Yeah, right.

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,800
Why don't they just call it
what it really is?

342
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,100
A pup tent to hide
your stretch marks.

343
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,800
Oh, actually, if it's okay,

344
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,500
I'm really not in the mood
right now. I'm sorry.

345
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
I understand.

346
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,600
Thanks.

347
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,600
You just don't want to be crushed
under the weight of a repulsive cow.

348
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,300
- That is not it.
- No, i get it.

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,300
Really,
i knew this day was coming.

350
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,200
I just didn't know it would be
a day when i was so horny.

351
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,500
Honey, i still find you
incredibly sexy.

352
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,400
It's me. I. ..

353
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,400
I just got a lot
on my mind right now.

354
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,300
Oh. What's going on?

355
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,600
I found out something
today.

356
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,000
I didn't want to tell you,
but...

357
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,900
well,
you can tell me anything.

358
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,600
That's what we talked about
in all those sessions with the doctor.

359
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,100
You're right.

360
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,500
But if i tell you,

361
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,800
You have to promise to let me
handle this my own way.

362
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
Who could that be
at this hour?

363
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,000
Susan.

364
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
What on earth?

365
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,500
<i>You are never to come
near my family ever again!</i>

366
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,600
- Do you understand?
- What are you talking about?

367
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Do you hear me, orson?!

368
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,100
Damn it. Susan, i--

369
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,800
I told you
to let me handle this.

370
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,600
Will someone please tell me??

371
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,700
So you don't know that
your husband tried to kill mike?

372
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,600
What?

373
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,700
Look, i explained this
to mike.

374
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,500
I panicked.
I was trying--

375
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,100
Trying to protect your mother?
I know. Who cares?

376
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,200
<i>You drove the car,
you ran him over,</i>

377
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,400
<i>And you left him for dead!</i>

378
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,500
Susan, let's go.

379
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
And the worst part...

380
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,200
all this time,
you pretended to be our friend.

381
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,300
<i>If there was one thing
gabrielle solis would not tolerate,</i>

382
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,800
<i>It was a rival,</i>

383
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,600
<i>Whether she walked
onwo legs...</i>

384
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,600
<i>or four.</i>

385
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,100
<i>So when gabrielle crept
into her bedroom that morning,</i>

386
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
<i>She'd made up her mind...</i>

387
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,700
the bitch had to go.

388
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,500
Roxy...

389
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,500
look what i've got.

390
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,900
Come on. Come on.

391
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,600
Yes.

392
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,200
Okay, let's go.

393
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,100
Let's go, roxy.

394
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,300
Let's go, roxy. Let's go.

395
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,800
<i>Let's go in the car.</i>

396
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,500
Hey there, dylan.

397
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,800
Don't you remember me?

398
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600
<i>I'm the cop who didn't give you
a ticket yesterday.</i>

399
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,500
Um, yeah, i  remember.

400
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,900
Would it be okay
if i sat down?

401
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,200
I just want to have
a little chat with you.

402
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Why?

403
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,900
Don't worry.
You're not in trouble.

404
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,300
Actually, i can't stay.

405
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm meeting my friend julie
at the mall, so i--

406
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,000
Look, i'm--I'm not trying
to scare you. I just...

407
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,900
i just want to talk.

408
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,500
Talk about what?

409
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,900
How's your mom doing?

410
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,100
You know my mom?

411
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,700
Oh, yeah.

412
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,700
Look,
a couple of days ago,

413
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,100
I saw a picture of you
and kathy in the paper,

414
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,200
And i did a background check,

415
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,900
And i found out that you're living
back at your aunt's place.

416
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,300
When you left yesterday,
i was parked down the street.

417
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,300
You followed me?

418
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,000
So when you pulled me over,

419
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,300
- That was--
- I lied to you.

420
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,000
You weren't speeding.

421
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
I'm sorry.

422
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,100
I just had to meet you.

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,200
<i>Who are you?</i>

424
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,800
I'm wayne davis.

425
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm your father.

426
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,600
Roxy, this way.
Um, excuse me for a second.

427
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,500
Uh, mrs. Solis,
what are you doing here?

428
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,800
Hi.
Uh, i'm bringing roxy back.

429
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,100
Uh, what?

430
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,100
Shame, isn't it?

431
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,100
<i>I mean, i personally adored
the little angel,</i>

432
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,900
But she and carlos
just did not get along.

433
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,800
Really?

434
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,400
Well, sorry it didn't work out.
I gotta run.

435
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,100
Tell carlos i'll call him
about another dog.

436
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,300
Oh, well, actually,
we found one.

437
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,300
From where? We're the only
guide dog school in the area.

438
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,500
Well, that's it. It's not a dog.

439
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,500
We got him
a seeing... eye... monkey.

440
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,100
He's amazing.

441
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,100
Not only can he call 9-1-1,
he can toast a bagel.

442
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,700
Bye.

443
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Roxy, what the heck happened
back there?

444
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,700
Roxy!

445
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,000
Roxy! Roxy, stop!

446
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,100
Gaby, where were you?
Where's roxy?

447
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,400
Oh, carlos, i'm afraid
i have some bad news.

448
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
What? At happened?

449
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,800
Well, you know how you like it
when i read you the box scores?

450
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,400
When i went out
to get the paper--

451
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,200
Ly thinking
of making you happy--

452
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,900
Gaby, where's my dog?

453
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
She ran away.

454
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,300
When i opened the door, she saw
a squirrel, and she took off.

455
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,200
She's gone?
Well, you gotta go find her.

456
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Where do you think i've been?
There's no sign of her anywhere.

457
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,300
Yeah, i'm sure you looked
really, really hard.

458
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,500
How dare you. I have looked from
one end of town to the other,

459
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,800
And i'm telling you,
she's nowhere to be found.

460
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,900
But since you love her so much,
i'm gonna keep looking.

461
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,300
Was that roxy?

462
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,200
I'm not sure.
Why don't i go look?

463
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,100
No. Oh, wow.
It's the scavo dog...

464
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,800
<i>way down in their yard.</i>

465
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,300
I guess it's true--

466
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,400
Lose one sense,
all the others get heightened.

467
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,200
Okay, you get that.
I'm gonna go find your dog.

468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Come on, you stupid mutt.

469
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,400
Gaby, you still here?

470
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Yeah,
still no sign of roxy.

471
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,900
But don't worry.
I'm on the case.

472
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,000
Hey.

473
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,900
That was steve
from the guide dog place.

474
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
You want a piece of pie
or somethin'?

475
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,400
Yeah, i'm not ngry either.

476
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't know
what to say to you.

477
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,400
You don't have
to say anything.

478
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,600
I'm having
a good time just looking at you.

479
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,900
You have my nose.

480
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,600
Bet you didn't know that,
right?

481
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,000
My mom says we left
because you used to beat her.

482
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,200
Is that true?

483
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,400
Yeah,
i hit her a couple times.

484
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,400
So you admit it?

485
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,600
What, did you think i was gonna lie
and tell you that i was a great husband?

486
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
'Cause i wasn't.

487
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,000
But you gotta know, there's
two sides to every story,

488
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,400
And i swear to god, your mom
gave as good as she got.

489
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,300
I mean,
you believe me, right?

490
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,100
I don't know.

491
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
You know what?

492
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,700
This was a mistake.
I should go.

493
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,500
Go? We just got here.

494
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,200
Look, i didn't track you down
to cause any problem

495
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,400
I only wanted to make sure that
your mom raised you properly,

496
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,700
And now i see that she did.
I mean, you're...

497
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,500
you're spectacular.

498
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,500
That's what i needed...

499
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,700
to know that you're okay
and...

500
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,100
that a little part of you
looks just like me.

501
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,900
How can you just walk away?

502
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,600
'Cause i'm not the same jerk
i used to be.

503
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,100
<i>Sure, i'd like to have
a relationship with you,</i>

504
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,100
But if your mom is still scared
of me after all these years, uh...

505
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
no.

506
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,400
I don't want
to upset her again.

507
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,600
I don't haveo tell her.

508
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
What?

509
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,400
She doesn't have to know
that i saw you.

510
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,100
Oh, that's...

511
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,700
<i>i don't know about that.</i>

512
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,500
It's just that i have
so many questions, and...

513
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,900
i don't think
we'd be hurting anybody

514
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,000
If we just sat
and talked for a while.

515
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,100
And we'd keep this
from your mom?

516
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,900
Sure.

517
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Well...

518
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,400
okay.

519
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,600
Darlin', bring me back
that dessert menu.

520
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,400
I wanna have a slice of pie
with my daughter.

521
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
Uh, i think we might
be out of candles.

522
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,700
I don't think so.
Check under the bar.

523
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Rick.

524
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,400
How's it goin'?

525
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,000
"How's it goin'"?

526
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,500
It's goin' pretty bad.

527
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,300
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry-- Sorry for your troubles.

528
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Oh, that's touching, man.

529
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,000
Thanks.

530
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,100
So did you just come here
to bust my hump,

531
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,900
Or is there something
i can help you with?

532
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Actually, you can help me.

533
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,500
You can help me figure out
what the hell these were doing

534
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,200
By the back door
of my torched restaurant.

535
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,800
How should i know?

536
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,200
So that's how
you're gonna play this?

537
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,100
No candles here. I'm--
I'm gonna go check in the back.

538
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Great.

539
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,200
Look, i can see you're upset,
pal,

540
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,500
But i'm not the guy
you're looking for.

541
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,400
You know i respect you...

542
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,200
hey, andrew.
What do you need?

543
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,100
Uh, i'm looking for candles,

544
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,700
And--And that guy rick's
here.

545
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,100
Oh, my god!

546
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,600
Stop it!
What are you doing?

547
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,500
Stop. Hey, easy. Easy.
Just stop it!

548
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

549
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,600
Andrew, do something!

550
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,700
Do something!

551
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,100
Stop it! Stop!

552
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh, for god sakes,
what is the matter with you?

553
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,100
What are you, 12 years old?
Stop it.

554
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,100
Jeez.

555
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,700
So when are you guys gonna
finish grilling my husband?

556
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,500
It won't be much longer, ma'am.

557
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,600
You know, in spite of
everything that's happened,

558
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,700
It's really good
to see you again.

559
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:36,300
It makes me realize
how much i miss you.

560
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,300
If you insist on questioning my husband
about a crime he didn't commit,

561
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,300
You should at least
have all the facts.

562
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,700
Okay. You've got my attention.

563
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,600
Well, for starters,

564
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,500
Mr. Coletti
opened his restaurant

565
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,200
To get back at me because i
wouldn't have an affair with him.

566
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,100
<i>- Honey.
- Oh,</i>

567
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,900
So you're saying your husband had
two motives for setting the fire?

568
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,000
No. I am saying that if anyone
had an ax to grind, it's rk.

569
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,300
Maybe he set the fire himself
soe could blame my husband.

570
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,100
I was at the gym.
You can call my trainer.

571
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,300
And tom was at
the founder's ball with me.

572
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,700
We have witnesses that say
he disappeared for a while.

573
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,100
I told you, i was in the car
listening to the basketball game.

574
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,100
That's true. I saw him.

575
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
I was mad that he ditched me,

576
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,200
So i went to drag his
ass back inside.

577
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,100
But when i saw him
shoutingt the radio,

578
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,700
I decided i'll just wait

579
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
<i>And make his life miserable
when we get home.</i>

580
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
So unless there's a law

581
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,200
Again schoosing lebron james
over your wife,

582
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I think we're done here.

583
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
All right.

584
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,800
So that's it? Y-You're
just gonna let him go?

585
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Look, we don't have enough
evidence to hold him, sir.

586
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,600
Because his wife
provided him an alibi?

587
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,600
Come on, man.

588
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,800
Rick, look.

589
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,900
You know me.

590
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,900
If tom had done
something like this,

591
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,200
Do you really think
i would protect him?

592
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,500
Fine.

593
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,100
You know, you didn't have
to make up that story for me.

594
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,500
Didn't i?
'Cause it kinda seemed

595
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,100
Like they had you
against the ropes in there.

596
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,800
Well, that would only be
a problem if i were guilty,

597
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,200
And clearly, i'm not, right?

598
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,000
God, you don't
believe me, do you?

599
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,400
Sure, i do. It must've been
some other random maniac

600
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,800
With a grudge against rick
who burned down his restaurant.

601
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,000
So you're calling me a liar?

602
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,400
That's what you're doing.
You're saying i lied.

603
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Well, it wouldn't be you
lied about the brick,

604
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,700
<i>And you were pretty smooth,
too. Hell, i bought it.</i>

605
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah, just like i bought your story
about never sleeping with rick.

606
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,400
Excuse me?

607
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,800
- "Oh, look at me, rick.
You know me, rick."
- Okay.

608
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,900
God, i felt like telling
you guys to get a room.

609
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,100
Okay, you are angry,
so i'm gonna let that one pass,

610
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,000
<i>And i'm gonna say this
for e very last time.</i>

611
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Nothing happened
between me and rick.

612
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,100
Okay.

613
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,400
I didn't set that fire.

614
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,000
You see? I can talk slow, too.

615
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,400
Carlos asked me to pick up
some doggy treats for roxy.

616
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,100
<i>He called you?
Why didn't he ask me?</i>

617
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, i think you were busy
at the time...

618
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,200
kidnapping his guide dog.

619
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
Classy, by the way.

620
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Don't judge me.

621
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,200
You don't know
this hound from hell.

622
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,700
<i>I raise my voice a teensy bit,
and she barks,</i>

623
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,400
Or i give carlos a little smack,
and she growls.

624
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,500
Well, i have an idea.

625
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,000
<i>Why don't you not
do those things?</i>

626
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,300
Thanks for the biscuits, edie.

627
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,200
No, i'm serious.

628
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,900
There was always
a certain... sick charm

629
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,700
To the way you used
to abuse carlos.

630
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,300
<i>But now that he's blind,
it's just sick.</i>

631
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,800
We're fine. This is who we are.
This is our relationship.

632
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,100
Well, ur relationship
has to change, gaby,

633
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,300
<i>Because he's changed.</i>

634
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Not that much.
Just his eyes.

635
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,900
Mm, no. I know carlos. He's proud.

636
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,700
He's gonna pretend that he can
still go toe-To-Toe with you

637
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,400
As if he was the same man
that he always was.

638
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,900
But he's not, and he
will never admit that.

639
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,600
Are you done with your armchair
analysis, 3-Divorce annie?

640
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,200
Sure. But if you're not
gonna treat carlos right,

641
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,900
There are plenty of
other womenout t ???

642
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,600
I think i proved that.

643
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,900
Why don't
you come inside?

644
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,800
I can't come out my front door
every day and see that man.

645
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,400
We have to move.

646
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,100
Oh.

647
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
Susan...

648
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,000
i know this is difficult,

649
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,100
But before you start
putting up "for sale" signs,

650
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,800
Let's just take a step back.

651
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,200
Take a step back from what?
He tried to murder you.

652
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,600
I know what orson did
was horrible, but...

653
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,400
i've decided
to forgive him.

654
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,700
How can you do that?
He put you in a coma.

655
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,700
I sat there day after day,
wondering if you were gonna live.

656
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,400
As far as i'm concerned,
orson can go to hell.

657
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,600
Well, i've talked to him. Trust me,

658
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,300
He's already been there.

659
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,800
Well, that's not enough.

660
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,600
He should pay for what he did.
He should go to prison.

661
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
And what, leave bree
without a husband

662
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,600
And benjamin without a dad?
You don't want tha

663
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,600
Look...

664
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,400
i've done some pretty horrible
things in my life,

665
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,800
But you forgave me

666
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,100
Because you knew how
much i regretted 'em.

667
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,700
I really believe
he's sorry for what he did.

668
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,300
<i>So now i have
to forgive him</i>

669
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,600
I've just got to.

670
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
But...

671
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,800
i also understand
if you can't.

672
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,400
<i>Hey, you guys know you're not
supposed to be out of bed.</i>

673
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,200
How come daddy's sleeping
on the couch again?

674
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,000
Come here.

675
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
Come on.

676
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,000
Okay.

677
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,000
Mommy and daddy
are sort of... fighting,

678
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,400
But we're working through it.

679
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,900
What are you fighting about?

680
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,600
Oh, something he did
that made mommy really mad.

681
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,700
Can we talk to you
about something?

682
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,000
Yes, of course.

683
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,400
The other day
at the pizza place...
mm-Hmm?

684
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,100
We heard daddy say that man
wanted to take you away from us.

685
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,400
Oh, sweetie, i am so sorry.

686
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
I bet that really
scared you, didn't it?

687
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Yeah.

688
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,700
So when you went
to that party,

689
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,900
We got on our bikes
and de down to his restaurant.

690
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,900
You did what?

691
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
We just wanted him
to go away.

692
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,500
<i>That's why we set the fire.</i>

693
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,500
<i>So please don't be mad at daddy.</i>

694
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,900
Oh, my god.

695
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,800
Mike says i need
to forgive orson...

696
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,200
susan--
And he's right.

697
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,200
I have to find a way
to make peace with all of this.

698
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,900
But you need to understand,

699
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,300
It's gonna be one of the
hardest things i've ever done.

700
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,700
And like most things
in my life,

701
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,600
I probably won't do it
with much elegance or grace.

702
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,700
So if i don't come over
to your house for coffee...

703
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,800
if i don't smile
when the two of you walk by,

704
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,100
Just please know
that i still love you.

705
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,200
And for forgiving orson...

706
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,600
just be patient.

707
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,000
I'll get there.

708
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,300
I think it's admirable that
you wanna forgive orson...

709
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,100
because i can't.

710
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,000
Whatcha doin'?

711
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,900
Working on the menu for the event
that bree and i are catering.

712
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,500
I have to stop now to...

713
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,000
pick up the invitations at
the printer's beforehey close.

714
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,200
I can do that for you.

715
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,400
- It's okay, sweetie.
- No, i want to.

716
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,300
Maybe i could pick up some
dinner for us on the way back.

717
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,700
You know, mrs. Hoskins' daughter
became nice like this once...

718
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,900
right before she brought
home a boy named slash.

719
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,600
I'm being nice because i've
been a pain lately, and...

720
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,100
with adam gone,
we need to be a team.

721
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,400
It's just us now.

722
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,500
What?

723
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,100
It's just...

724
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,900
it's like you turned
into this lovely young woman

725
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,300
When i wasn't looking.

726
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,900
Hey.

727
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,100
We have to stop at the printer
on the way to dinner.

728
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,500
Whatever you say,
sweetheart.

729
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,700
<i>The truth is,</i>

730
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,200
<i>Everyone breaks the rules
now and then...</i>

731
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
well, what you've you
been doing?

732
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,200
<i>Never thinking for one second
they might get caught.</i>

733
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
...some things disappear.

734
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,700
Like, that happened
to me like...

735
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,100
<i>but if they do,</i>

736
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,700
<i>They simply ask
for forgiveness.</i>

737
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,500
<i>And most of the time,
they receive it.</i>

738
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,800
<i>But some acts are so wicked,</i>

739
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,400
<i>They demand only
our condemnation.</i>

740
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,100
<i>How do people avoid
such a fate?</i>

741
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,900
<i>Well... the trick is</i>

742
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,200
<i>Knowing which rules
are made to be broken...</i>

743
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
<i>and which rules...</i>

744
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,400
<i>are not.</i>

745
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:22,400
