00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,782
So what's the plan?

179
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:02,220
Well, the way I see it,
if Davina wants to use

180
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:04,894
Mikael to kill me, we
just have two options.

181
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:06,095
One, you reason with her.

182
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:08,426
Two...

183
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,632
I don't think you'd
like two very much.

184
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:14,844
Fine. Let's go.

185
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:21,908
[Chanting]

186
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:29,747
Kol, concentrate.

187
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:32,082
Unless of course
you've finally heard

188
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,282
from our missing Davina Claire.

189
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:36,329
Well, it's only
a matter of time.

190
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,718
I mean, look at this face.

191
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,707
How long can she
possibly resist?

192
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:43,706
Given your progress,
I'd say indefinitely.

193
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:48,787
No matter.

194
00:08:48,788 --> 00:08:50,489
I'll find her.

195
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:53,630
Now focus.

196
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,433
Conjure her in your mind.

197
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:01,201
[Chanting]

198
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,444
Clever girl.
She's somehow blocked

199
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,071
our locator spells.

200
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,943
Not entirely my fault then.

201
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:14,247
Considering your sole task
was keeping track

202
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:15,683
of a teenager,
you might want to draw

203
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:19,330
a little less attention to your
absolute failure to do so.

204
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:21,192
You're one to talk
about your failure.

205
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,693
You got that human girl to bare

206
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:24,826
her soul to you yet,
or are you too busy

207
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:28,127
playing captain to a pack of
mangy dogs to have any success

208
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:29,529
as a fake head shrinker?

209
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,175
You know what
your problem is, Kol?

210
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:32,734
- Oh, I would love to...
- Boys.

211
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:40,975
Now if I'm right, Davina
has the white oak stake.

212
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:44,267
Find the girl, Kol,
and get it back.

213
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,986
Davina: You don't look so good.

214
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:51,515
Those bites?

215
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:56,367
Werewolf venom is to be purged
by force, not acquiesced to.

216
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:58,457
And what is that, like,
a viking bumper sticker?

217
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:02,490
Exactly how much longer are
we gonna be hiding here like cowards?

218
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,708
Elijah saw you.

219
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,762
If he knows you're here,
then Klaus does, too,

220
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:07,365
so I'm sorry,
but until I unlink him

221
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:10,089
from my friends,
you're stuck here with me.

222
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,508
Confrontation
is inevitable, child.

223
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,440
Your fear will prove to be
our greatest disadvantage.

224
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:16,542
I'm not afraid.

225
00:10:16,543 --> 00:10:17,610
Well, you should be.

226
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,743
You are weak.

227
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,746
But I'm still in charge.

228
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:26,731
By the way, I spelled it
while you were purging.

229
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:28,858
It won't fall off again.

230
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:31,322
Ah, yes.
Your magic.

231
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:34,929
How well did that serve you
when the wolves attacked, hmm?

232
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,994
Magic can only ever
fight half your battles.

233
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:41,875
Remember that.

234
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,293
Ok. Fine.

235
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:51,568
You're so tough, teach me.

236
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,489
Teach you what?

237
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,954
How to be strong.

238
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:59,223
Gia: We don't want to run.

239
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:01,960
Marcel: Look. I know,
and I respect that.

240
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,160
But believe me,
there's a big difference

241
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,763
between wanting to fight
and knowing how to win.

242
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:06,928
So show us.

243
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,296
You've kicked their ass before.

244
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:09,731
I'm guessing you
didn't do it alone.

245
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:12,066
Um, yeah. Not that I don't dig

246
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,933
the whole "karate kid" vibe
that we got going on here,

247
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,432
but how are we supposed
to learn to defend

248
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:20,279
ourselves from an army of
superwolves in, like, one day?

249
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,739
Lesson one.

250
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,249
Always be on your guard.

251
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:44,318
Well, I trust our message
was well-received.

252
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,416
Loud and clear.
Those vampires should be

253
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:47,584
gone by tomorrow.

254
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:48,819
In my experience,
one can never be

255
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,648
too careful with
these creatures,

256
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,189
so we'll greet them
with superior numbers.

257
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,059
Would you bring the recruits,
please sir?

258
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,068
Oliver, Aiden, I have
a task for you.

259
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,175
What's going on here?

260
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:10,414
Tonight is luna sanguineus,
a blood moon.

261

Now 1,000 years ago,

this celestial event
with a rite of passage,

263
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:18,559
electing not to shrink
from their nature

264
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,098
but to embrace it with pride

265
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:24,974
by slaying a human being
and activating their curse.

266
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:29,309
Tonight as unturned
wolves, you will kill

267
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,147
with the singular purpose

268
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,285
of unleashing that warrior
that lives within you.

269
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,221
Aiden: They're just
a bunch of kids.

270
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,956
Aiden, we can no longer afford

271
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:41,115
to hide our children
from the horrors of war.

272
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:46,369
From now on, your either with
us, or you're against us.

273
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,036
Come with me.

274
00:13:02,859 --> 00:13:05,389
What's that?

275
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,332
The crest of our clan, a
reminder that we always carry

276
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,474
the honor of our ancestors
before we go to battle.

277
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,715
I wasn't ready.

278
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,822
First lesson, always
be on your guard.

279
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:22,150
It's heavy.

280
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,552
I was half your age
the first time

281
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,409
my father gave me the staff.

282
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,119
I would have torn every muscle

283
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,431
rather than let him see
me strain, and had I...

284
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,087
He would have corrected me.

285
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:38,209
No offense,
but your dad sounds like a jerkwad.

286
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,744
Mothers love their children.

287
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,297
Fathers make them strong.

288
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:47,257
My mother tried to sacrifice me,

289
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:50,346
and my dad took off
when I was born, so...

290
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:53,896
You're anticipating.

291
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:56,190
Do not let me see
your move before you make it.

292
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:59,780
Unh!

293
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:00,814
Get up.

294
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:03,280
I can't. Unh.

295
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:04,514
I hurt my ankle.

296
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:07,317
The ability to endure pain is
the warrior's true weapon.

297
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:14,250
Master that, and nothing
holds power over you.

298
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:17,999
Now on your feet.

299
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,743

00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,364
Good.

learned something today.

Did I not sufficiently
explain to you

309
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,536
the urgency of this endeavor?

310
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:02,173
You're the one who hijacked
my afternoon to drag me along

311
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:04,008
to this revenge fantasy
of yours.

a drink to take off the edge

before the killing begins.

So that's your plan, is it?

Ply me with alcohol and then
prattle on until I'm convinced

316
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,809
Davina and Mikael alone
to plot my death?

317
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,938
No. My plan is to listen.

318
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,487
Come on, Klaus.
You could have

319
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:19,688
eavesdropped on
that phone call and vanished

before I even knew
you were there,

00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:33,617
You change the key.

356
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:35,451
Very nice.

357
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:40,623
Now the head or the heart?

358
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:44,429
None of this means anything
if you cannot make the kill.

359
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,829
What if I can't do it?

360
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,599
You will to
survive.

361
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,175
Now the head or the heart?

362
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:11,899
Elijah.

363
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:19,156
We need to talk.

364
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,104
We're not here for a fight.

365
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,223
Just hear him out.

366
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:32,383
Speak.

367
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,385
I suggest you be succinct.

368
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:39,009
Please. I need your help.

369
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,547
The witch wants soldiers.

370
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,048
So now it's either join up
or pay the price.

371
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,749
I've known my brother
Finn to be merciless.

372
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,242
I'll admit this exceeds
even my expectations.

373
00:18:58,243 --> 00:18:59,521
They're just kids.

374
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:01,754
Marcel, you know the quarter
like the back of your hand

375
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:04,039
if anyone can get
them out of here, it's you.

376
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,421
And take them where?

377
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:07,090
There are still wolves
deep in the bayou,

378
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,525
ones that didn't take a ring.

379
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:09,861
They can look after them.

380
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,799
The ones who never
sold out, you mean.

381
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,906
If you want to look at it like that,
that's fine.

382
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:17,940
We did what we had to do.

383
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,576
You wolves have been
fighting us for decades.

384
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,052
Why trust us now?

385
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:28,651
One of the recruits
is my little brother.

386
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:30,519
There's no way I'm
sending him to war.

387
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:41,167
Tell us what you need.

388
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:44,747
My mother's intentions are far
less savage than my father's.

389
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,777
She'd prefer to place
us all in new bodies,

390
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:49,913
there by reuniting
our family in some bizarre coven

391
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:51,607
of extremely
dysfunctional witches.

392
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,550
So, what,
are you just gonna kill her, too?

393
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:56,958
If only I could,
but therein lies my predicament.

394
00:19:56,959 --> 00:20:00,387
If I kill her,
she'll just jump into another body,

395
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,348
and if I somehow manage
to thwart that

396
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:05,104
nasty little inconvenience,

397
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:06,940
she'll rejoin the bloody
witch ancestors

398
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:08,687
and haunt me from beyond.

399
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:14,449
Right now, Mikael
has the white oak stake.

400
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,153
He needs to die first.

401
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:20,260
And how are you gonna
do that unarmed?

402
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,999
I've taken precautions.

403
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,068
Oh, goodie. Papa Tunde's
mystical knife

404
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:27,236
of ludicrous torment.

405
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:28,604
Glad that's still around.

406
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:30,008
You know my parents
dedicated their lives

407
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,628
to making me feel
weak and afraid.

408
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:34,648
I've killed them once already.

409
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,090
I can do it again.

410
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:38,052
Klaus, wait.

411
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,953
I get it.

412
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:42,024
The hurt your parents
have inflicted on you

413
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,765
for a thousand years, I understand
what you are fighting against,

414
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:49,139
but the real question is
what are you fighting for?

415
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,375
Ask me to dance.

416
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,900
You want to dance?

417
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:56,851
No. I never want to dance.

418
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:58,052
I'm actually really bad at it,

419
00:20:58,053 --> 00:21:00,488
but I'm trying to make a point.

420
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:03,409
There's more to life than the pain
that they made you feel.

421
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:12,001
A cold beer, a slow
song, a good friend.

422
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:14,670
There are good things, Klaus.

423
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:17,881
[Music playing]

424
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:20,081
And you need to see that, too.

425
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:39,982
There's no real peace
in revenge.

426
00:21:58,263 --> 00:21:59,376
[Whoosh]

427
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:05,642
[Sighs]

428
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,641
Yeah. I've read about this.

429
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:12,590
I've never actually
seen it firsthand.

430
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:14,123
It appears someone
has knocked you

431
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,693
head over heels quite literally,

432
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:18,712
and I thought I'd
have that honor.

433
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:20,773
Hmm.

434
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,366
Ugh! It smells like...

435
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,744
The wrong end of something
quite dead, yeah.

436
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:29,048
It's just a little
something I picked up

437
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:32,354
from a shaman bloke in Uganda.

438
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:35,690
There we go.

439
00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:38,461
[Inhales]

440
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,031
Wow! The pain's just...

441
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:42,702
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

442
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:47,508
It's magic, right,
it's not a miracle.

443
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:51,641
[Sighs]

444
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:54,248
It's quite a spell
you've got going here.

445
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,983
I mean, not to pry,
but I figured

446
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:57,784
you had your secrets
after our last date ended

447
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:59,358
in a werewolf bar brawl.

448
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,856
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

449
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:05,948
That's right. I never really
liked dull girls anyway.

450
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:08,612
That said, what exactly
is going on here?

451
00:23:11,454 --> 00:23:13,966
You're still not
the trusting sort.

452
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,644
Do you trust me?

453
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:20,921
Are you slicked?

454
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:25,149
Those sad eyes might fool
some people but not me.

455
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,922
I know what you're after.

456
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:30,342
You've got a lecherous
heart Davina Claire.

457
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:33,787
I won't be used, not for my
body nor my medicinal herbs.

458
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:37,495
We can hold hands, that's it.

459
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:39,927
Whatever it is you're up to,

460
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:42,146
well, you can tell me
when you're good and ready.

461
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:53,277
Aiden: Now the kids are being
held in the city of the dead

462
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:54,511
until we bring them
through the quarter

463
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:56,811
to St. Anne's church.

464
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,709
Now meanwhile, Vincent
is holding a meeting

465
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,875
with a few humans in the know,

466
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,044
the ones who have been reluctant

467
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:04,006
to fall in line
with his new leadership.

468
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,949
He's going to use the children
to kill any opposition.

Activate their curse,
send a message

to anyone who's thinking
about going against him.

471

It's two birds, one bloodbath.

472
00:24:12,223 --> 00:24:14,557
Ok. So we'll hit them while
the kids are on the move.

473
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,659
Aiden, make certain you
and Oliver escort the children.

474
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,826
We'll handle the rest.

475
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:20,225
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

476
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,726
Esther and her psycho
sun are already

00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,461
giving me the stink-eye.

00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,496
These kids go missing on my watch,
I'm as good as dead.

479
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,490
You wanted to help your people
and make amends for the past.

480
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:32,001
This is your chance.

481
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:52,284

liar and a thief?

not to harm me.

Where are they?
