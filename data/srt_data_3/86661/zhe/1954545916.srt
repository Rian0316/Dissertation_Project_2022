你该独自旅行的 华生

胡说

40
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,551
你对考古很感兴趣是吗?
You have an interest in archeology do you not?

00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:34,953
你怎么知道的?

44

你鞋尖上 膝盖下面
You've got mud on the points of your shoes

00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,553
和右手上

太精彩了
Splendid, splendid.

这说明你之前跪了一段时间在地上

49
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:52,155
华生 你越来越不可思议了

50
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,359
你是个左撇子园丁
You're a left-handed gardener.

51
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,126
还是考古专业的学生

埋葬风俗的文章
surrounding the neolithic burial rites.

00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:03,769
您 尊敬的Francis Roundhay 还是当地教区的牧师

你拿钓绳的那只手

完全正确
Exactly right.

60
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:22,459
每个细节都准确无误 但是你是怎么
Precise in every detail but how sir?

61
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,897
怎么知道
How?

62
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,457
教区牧师...
Vicar, vicar vic...

63
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:26,468
这本教区的杂志...
the parish magazine has...

64
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:37,779
村子就在这附近吗?
The village is nearby?

65
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:40,111
是的 沿着滨海小道就能走到
Oh yes just along the coastal path.

66
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:42,844
村子很偏僻 但能满足我们全部所需
It's secluded but it caters for all our needs.

67
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,564
那是最近的居所吗?
I suppose is that the nearest habitation?

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,910
不 不 还有Tregennis家的房子
No, no, the Tregennis Estate

69
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,456
就在内陆一英里处
is about a mile inland.

70

非常和善的一家
Very nice people

71
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:51,356
我相信他们会向你展示
and I'm sure they'll extend to you

00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:55,328
康沃尔人的热情好客
some fine Cornish hospitality.

73
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:55,910
不过...
However,

74
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:59,031
我已经打扰你们太久了
I've imposed enough upon you for one day.

75
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:00,465
或许你们愿意

00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,797
来我的住处

77
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,167
共进晚餐?
one evening at the vicarage.

78
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,638
那我们就要打扰到你和你的家人了
Oh then we should impose upon you and your family?

79
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:07,402
哦不会的 我是单身
Oh no alas, I have no family.

80
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,306
我和Tregennis先生住在一起
I live alone except for Mr. Tregennis,

81
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:11,173
他住其中的一间
who has a suite of rooms in the house.

82
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,611
他为什么不住在自家房子里?
But does he not live on the estate?

83
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:15,341
家庭不合
A family dispute.

84
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,076
他的妹妹和两个兄弟住在那儿
His sister and two brothers live there

85
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,243
但他选择搬出来
but he chooses to live apart.

86
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,382
去牧师家里共进晚餐
Do you know dinner at the vicarage

87
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,930
是个很好的主意
is a splendid idea.

88
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:30,987
我们得安排一下时间
We must arrange a date.

89
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,762
那是当然的 先生们
Yes, well of course gentlemen,

90
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,963

早上好
Good morning.

92
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:16,297
康沃尔人的热情好客

93
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:20,034
风化后凹凸不平的花岗岩
Weathered pitted slabs of granite.

94
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:23,442
古时的坟墓散布在
Ancient tombs scattered throughout

95
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:26,072
这个半岛冗长的岁月里
the lengthened breath of this peninsula.

96
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,845
就像大海
Like the sea.

97
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:32,910
我想死亡始终如影随形吧
I suppose death is always with us.

98
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:40,023
是啊
Quite so.

99
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,809
在康沃尔的这些日子里
Quite often during those days in Cornwall,

100
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,507
福尔摩斯常常独自出行
Holmes would stride out alone.

101
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,414
此地的神秘与魅力
The mystery and glamour of the place

102
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,269
以及被遗忘的民族留下的不祥之气
with its sinister atmosphere of forgotten nations

103
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:12,285
吸引着我这位朋友的想象力
appeal to the imagination of my friend.

104
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,154
他花很长时间漫步
He spent much of his time in long walks

105
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,769
独自冥想
and solitary meditation.

106
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,431
然而在一个早晨
One morning however,

107
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:05,030
我朋友的恢复疗养
my friend's convalescence

108
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,802
被粗暴地打断了
was violently interrupted.

109
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,201
先生们 我强烈建议你们求助于警方
Gentlemen I urge you to consult the police.

110
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,246
福尔摩斯是位病人
Holmes is a sick man.

111
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:18,341
是的 但在渐渐康复中 华生
Yes but getting better all the time, Watson.

112
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:24,823
是有紧急事件发生吧
This is a matter of some emergency.

113
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:26,052
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

114
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:27,421
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

115
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:28,755
我们只能将您
we can only regard it

116
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,126
恰巧出现在此时此地
as a special Providence

117
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:32,255
看做是上天的特别眷顾
that you should chance to be here at this time,

118
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,060
因为在整个英格兰
for in all England

119
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:35,623
你是我们唯一真正需要的人
you are the one man we truly need.

120
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,191
我试图跟Trengennis先生
I tried to explain to Mr. Tregennis

121
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,463
和Roundhay先生解释
and Mr. Roundhay

122
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:40,301
说你在疗养
that you're in convalescence.

123
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,033
我相信他们一定赞成
Yes I'm sure they'll be very sympathetic,

124
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,369
请坐
please sit down.

125
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:45,466
谢谢
Thank you.

126
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,737
事实上
The fact is,

127
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,780
正如我向华生医生所解释的
as I've explained to Doctor Watson,

128
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:51,839
一件异常骇人的悲剧
the most extraordinary and tragic affair

129
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:53,941
昨晚发生在这里
has occurred here during the night.

130
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,911
洗耳恭听
You have my full attention.

131
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,547
我应该先介绍一下
Perhaps I had better say a few words first.

132
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:01,319
这位是我曾提到的
This is Mr. Tregennis,

133
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,155
Tregennis先生
of whom I spoke.

134
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,821
Tregennis先生昨晚
Now Mr. Tregennis spent last night

135
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,296
与他的兄弟

00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:09,854
George和Owen

137
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,400
以及妹妹Brenda一同
and his sister Brenda,

138
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:13,699
在Tredannick Wartha的房子里
at their house of Tredannick Wartha.

139
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,362
他走的时候
He left them,

140
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:16,735
他们围坐在餐桌前玩牌
playing cards around the dining table

141
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:20,241
身体和精神状态都很好
in excellent health and spirits.

142
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,504
但他今天早上回去的时候
But on his return this morning

143
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:26,742
发现情形极其诡异
he discovered a truly bizarre state of affairs.

144
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:29,147
三个人 不论生者还是死者
All three both alive and dead,

145
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:31,084
脸上都保留着
retained upon their faces

146
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:34,987
极度恐惧的表情
an expression of the utmost horror.

147
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:37,024
死者呢?
Dead?

148
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:38,865
死于惊恐
A convulsion of terror.

149
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:46,162
惨不忍睹
It was dreadful to look upon.

150
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:48,428
房里还有其它人吗?
Was there any sign of anyone else in the house?

151
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:50,198
只有Porter女士
Only Mrs. Porter,

152
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,431
她是厨师兼管家

153

她昨晚睡得很沉
She had slept deeply

154

没听见任何声响

有什么异常被遗漏了吗?
Is anything missing, disarranged?

156
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,340
没有 福尔摩斯先生
Nothing, Mr. Holmes.

157
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:03,608
是怎样的恐惧
What could possibly

158
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,048
能够让一位青年女子死亡
frighten a young woman to death

159
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:06,277
让两位壮汉疯掉呢?
and two strong men out of their senses?

160
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:07,684
嗯 会是什么呢
Yes what indeed.

161
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,620
福尔摩斯 我相信本地警方
Well I'm sure, Holmes, that the local police

162
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:12,455
将会得出结论
would have reached some conclusions.

163
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:14,254
但很可能是不正确的
However, erroneous they may be.

164
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:16,157
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

165
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,558
想一想
Think.

166
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,623
告诉我昨晚的情况 Tregennis先生
Tell me about last night, Mr. Tregennis.

167
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,564
好的 福尔摩斯先生
Well Mr. Holmes,

168
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,428
我在那里吃过晚饭
I supped there,

169
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:31,303
正如牧师所说
as the vicar has said,

170
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:34,004
之后我的哥哥George
and my elder brother George

171
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,013
提议玩一会儿扑克牌
proposed a game of whist afterwards.

172
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,572
我走的时候是十点一刻
It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.

173
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:42,585
谁送你出门?
Who let you out?

174
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:44,211
Potter夫人已经睡了
Mrs. Potter had gone to bed

175
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,845
所以我自己出了门
so I let myself out.

176
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:49,153
他们所处房间的窗户都关着
The window of the room in which they sat was closed,

177
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:52,456
但窗帘并没有拉上
but the blind was not drawn down.

178
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:53,825
今天早上
There was no change

179
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,887
门和窗子都和昨晚一样
in door or window this morning,

180
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,364
也没有理由怀疑
nor any reason to think

181
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:01,926
有陌生人进入过房子
that any stranger had been to the house.

182
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:04,973
他们就坐在原地
Yet there they sat,

183
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,806
完全被吓疯了
driven clean mad with terror.

184
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,936
在我有生之年我都无法
I'll never get the sight of that room

185
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:14,310
把那个房间的景象从我脑海中磨灭
out of my mind so long as I live.

186
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:19,981
是啊 事实总是最深刻的
Yes, the facts are most remarkable.

187
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,645
Tregennis先生你个人认为
Mr. Tregennis do you have any theory of your own

188
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:24,384
他们为何会遭此不幸?
which might account for them?

189
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,426
这是魔鬼
It is devilish.

190
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:29,620
魔鬼 福尔摩斯先生
Devilish, Mr. Holmes.

191
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:33,029
那力量不属于这个世界
It is not of this world.

192
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,760
如果这个事件已超出人类范畴
Well the matter is beyond humanity

193
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:36,631
那它自然也超出我的能力范围
it is certainly beyond me.

194
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:41,509
的确如此 福尔摩斯
I trust so, Holmes.

195
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,369
想想
Now think.

196
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:49,572
仔细想一想 Tregennis先生
Think very carefully, Mr. Tregennis,

197
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:53,014
昨晚你们在一起的时间里
about the evening that you spent together.

198
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,315
你记忆里有没有什么特别的事情
Does anything stand out in your memory

199
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:59,720
能为这场惨剧提供一点线索
which might throw some light upon this tragedy?

200
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,350
没有 福尔摩斯先生
There is nothing, Mr. Holmes.

201
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:04,758
他们是容易不安的人吗?
Were they nervous people?

202
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:07,194
他们曾表现出任何恐惧的预兆吗?
Did they ever show any sign of apprehension?

203
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,893
我认为没有 福尔摩斯先生
Not to my knowledge, Mr. Holmes.

204
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:13,060
那你就对我的探案没什么帮助了
Then there's nothing in which you can assist me.

205
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:21,436
我突然想起一件事
There is one thing occurs to me.

206
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:24,969
我坐在桌边的时候背对着窗户
As I sat at the table my back was to the window,

207
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,447
我的哥哥George
and my brother George,

208
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:28,540
玩牌的时候和我一伙
he being my partner at cards,

209
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:30,380
面朝窗户
was facing it.

210
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:33,614
我见他有一次从我肩上看过去
I saw him once look hard over my shoulder,

211
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,886
所以我也回头看了看
so I turned round and looked also.

212
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,552
窗帘没拉 窗户关着
The blind was up and the window shut,

213
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:44,461
我只能看到庭院里的矮树丛
but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn,

214
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,998
但有一个瞬间
and it seemed to me for a moment

215
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:50,060
我好像看到有什么东西在移动
that I saw something moving among them.

216
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:53,595
说不清那是人或动物
I couldn't even say if it was man or animal,

217
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:57,337
只是觉得有东西在那儿
but I just thought I saw something there.

218
00:13:57,412 --> 00:14:00,141
你没想要弄清楚吗?
Did you not investigate?

219
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,613
当时认为没什么
Well the matter passed as unimportant.

220
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:05,173
你看到任何恶魔的迹象吗?
Did you have any premonition of evil?

221
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:07,048
我只是觉得
None that I was aware of.

222
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,552
你怎么会这么早
How did you hear the terrible news

223
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:10,088
就得知噩耗?
so early this morning?

224
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:11,589
我习惯早起
I am an early riser.

225
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:14,125
一般在早餐前散步
Generally take a walk before breakfast.

226
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:15,683
今早我刚刚出门
This morning I had hardly started

227
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:16,523
Richard医生
when Doctor Richard

228
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,062
驾着马车找到了我
overtook me in his carriage.

229
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,724
Tregennis先生
Mr. Tregennis.

230
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:25,010
我刚从你妹妹家得知了一条紧急消息
I've just heard an urgent message from your sister's house.

231
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:26,163
怎么了?
What's happened?

232
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:27,670
我不是很确定
I'm not quite sure, sir,

233
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:30,298
你最好还是跟我去一趟吧
but you'd better come with me.

234
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:40,945
她死了至少六个小时
She's been dead at least six hours.

235
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:45,011
没有施暴的痕迹
No signs of violence.

236
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,547
但为什么?
But how?

237
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:52,424
Tregennis先生 我从未见过这种情形
I've never seen the like, Mr. Tregennis.

238
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:58,763
这么多年来...
Not in all my years has a...

239
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:00,632
你还好吗?
You all right?

240
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:02,086
我来扶着你 过来...
I've got you. Here.

241
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,172
过来
Over here.

242
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:06,868
坐下
There we go.

243
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:10,673
他差点也在我们面前出事
We nearly got him on our hands as well.

244
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,178
你要去哪儿 福尔摩斯
Where are you going Holmes?

245
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,775
去Tredannick Wartha 不能耽搁
Tredannick Wartha without delay.

246
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:19,217
福尔摩斯先生
With your permission Mr. Holmes

247
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:19,826
请您允许我先走一步
I'll go on ahead.

248
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:20,811
谢谢你 牧师...快点
Thank you vicar, quickly,

249
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:22,161
否则我们就要比你先到了
otherwise we'll be there before you.

250
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:23,139
福尔摩斯 我必须劝阻你
Holmes, I must protest.

251
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:25,416
把你的劝阻留着吧 华生
Save your protestations for later, Watson,

252
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,808
多留一会儿
much later!

253
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,388
我想你因为某些原因
I gather you were divided

254
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:30,929
和你的家庭分开了
in some way from your family.

255
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,589
是的 福尔摩斯先生
Oh yes sir, Mr. Holmes.

256
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,099
那已经是过去的事情了
Well the matter is past and done with.

257
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,634
一切都已经被原谅和遗忘了
All was forgiven and forgotten

258
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:38,534
我们曾是最亲密的朋友
and we were the best of friends.

259
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,665
我们家曾在Redruth作锡矿工
We were a family of tin-miners at Redruth,

260
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,208
但我们把家族企业卖给了一家公司
but we sold out our venture to a company,

261
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,507
就此退休并有了足够的钱维持生计
and so retired with enough to keep us.

262
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,308
我不否认分家产的时候
I won't deny there was some bad feeling

263
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,144
有一些不愉快
over the division of the money.

264
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,446
彼此间的不睦有很多年了
It stood between us for a number of years.

265
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,179
不过
Nevertheless.

266
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,883
你决定不离开Cornwall?
You decided not to leave Cornwall?

267
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,756
我想我还怀着某天
I supposed I entertained

268
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,161
欣喜的回到家人身边的希望
some hopes of returning home one day.

269
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:08,823
福尔摩斯!
' Holmes!

270
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:15,601
福尔摩斯 快靠边!
Holmes, stand back!

271
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,374
我的兄弟们
My brothers.

272
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,848
他们要被送去Helston
They're taking them to Helston.

273
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,832
这房子真不错 Tregennis先生
It's a lovely house, Mr. Tregennis.

274
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:54,999
这是很悲伤的地方
It's a very sad house.

275
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:56,407
这就是你看到
This is the window

276
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,308
影子的那扇窗户
through which you saw the shadow form.

277
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,888
它距离窗户大概有多远?
Approximately what distance was it from the glass?

278
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:07,613
我想不少于10英尺
I'd say not less than ten feet.

279
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:10,517
我感觉
With a guess,

280
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,615
大概这么远
about here.

281
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,523
没有强迫闯入的迹象
There's no sign of a forced entry.

282
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:15,993
窗户当然是
And the window, of course,

283
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:16,891
一直锁着的
would have remained locked.

284
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:18,429
我妹妹查看它是否锁着
My sister made sure of that.

285
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:20,193
即便在Cornwall
Even in Cornwall.

286
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,165
太抱歉了
So dreadfully sorry.

287
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,600
没关系 福尔摩斯先生
It's quite all right, Mr. Holmes.

288
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,001
小意外
An accident.

289
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:37,316
谢谢
Thank you.

290
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,414
能告诉Porter夫人我回来了吗?
Could you let Mrs. Porter know I'm back?

291
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,308
我想见见管家
I should like to meet the housekeeper.

292
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,938
当然可以
Of course.

293
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:14,642
但请尽量避免
Oh but please try to avoid

294
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,808
再让她过于悲痛
causing further distress.

295
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:20,294
死亡总是悲痛的
Death is always distressing, Mr.Tregennis.

296
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:24,485
啊 椅子呢...
Awe, the chairs.

297
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,958
在警察离开这里后
Well they must have been moved

298
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,154
它们一定被移动过
after the police left the house.

299
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:31,198
那把是在这儿 福尔摩斯先生
That one here, Mr. Holmes.

300
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:32,596
这把在那儿
One over there.

301
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,293
这个在这儿
This one here.

302
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:38,497
这把在这儿
This one over here.

303
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:41,597
还有什么其他东西被移动过吗?
Has anything else been moved?

304
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,302
所有都跟我记忆中一样
All is as I remember it.

305
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:45,180
你一定了解
You must understand

306
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:47,403
今早我来这儿的时候
there was a great deal of fuss and confusion

307
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,539
是多么的忙乱和困惑
when I arrived this morning.

308
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:50,946
可能有东西被移动过
Things may have been moved

309
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:52,198
没有想到它们在
without thought given to their significance

310
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:53,401
犯罪调查中的重要性
in a criminal investigation.

311
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:54,501
犯罪?
Criminal?

312
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:57,984
这个词很有趣
That is a very interesting word.

313
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,614
这么说你又不赞成
So you no longer subscribe to the theory

314
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:04,890
所谓超自然的解释了?
of a supernatural explanation?

315
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:06,897
我不知道
I don't know.

316
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:09,956
大家是怎么坐的?
Where were people sitting?

317
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:12,594
我坐在这儿 面对着Georgie
I sat here facing Georgie,

318
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:15,035

319

哦 这很古怪

322
00:19:19,537 --> 00:19:20,608
怎么?

323
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:23,574
我是说从这个位置看出去
I mean from this position

324
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,204
窗外的东西
the figure outside of the window

325
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,836
想必要超过6英尺
must have been well over six feet.

326
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:32,777
福尔摩斯先生 我只能如实 告诉你我所见到的

328
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,518

亲爱的 我想让你见一下这些先生们

00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:54,766
那么...美...丽

332
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:57,208
她还是很难过
She is still very upset.

333
00:19:57,278 --> 00:20:00,644
我们都很难过 Roundhay先生
We're all very upset Mr. Roundhay.

00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:04,410
我不会再留在这个房子里
I will not stay in this house

336
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:06,248
多一秒钟
one moment longer than I have to.

337
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,054
我要回到自己家去

338
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,389
但你也是我们家的一份子啊
But you're part of our family.

339
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,918
Tregennis一家已经不在了 先生
The family Tregennis is dead, sir.

340
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:20,658
至少是如死了一般
Dead or as good as.

341
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:24,463
我还活着呢
I'm still alive.

342
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,299
Porter夫人
Mrs. Porter,

343
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:32,906
不好意思
excuse me now.

344
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:34,968
Porter夫人
Mrs. Porter.

345
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:45,222
我叫夏洛克 福尔摩斯

346
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,020
我希望你能告诉我所有你知道的事

347
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:51,390
福尔摩斯先生是位侦探
Mr. Holmes is a detective.

348
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:52,985
他是来想要找出
He's going to try and find out

349
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:55,075
Brenda发生了什么 别紧张
what happened to Brenda. Don't you worry.

350
00:20:56,467 --> 00:21:00,596
请不要有所保留
Please, leave nothing out.

351
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,434
我只知道很少 福尔摩斯先生
I can tell you very little, Mr. Holmes.

352
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:13,142
你出老千
Awe, you've been cheating.

353
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:14,841
我没有
I am not cheating.

354
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,749
Owen 告诉你亲爱的妹妹
Owen will you tell your dearest sister

355
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,811
按规则玩牌
to play by the rules.

356
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:21,252
她也是你妹妹
Well she's your sister too.

357
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,620
你跟她说
You tell her.

358
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:24,817
但她是跟你一伙的
But she's on your side.

359
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:25,570
时候不早了
It's rather late

360
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:28,488
我得回牧师家了
and I do have to get back to the vicarage.

361
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,427
Mortimer 你晚上还是留宿在这里吧
Mortimer you must stay here for the night.

362
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,300
答应了吧
Oh please say you will.

363
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:40,231
那...
Well?

364
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:43,434
如果他不愿意就不要强迫他 Brenda
Don't force him to stay if he doesn't want to, Brenda.

365
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,142
哦 是吗
Oh really,

366
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,171
我以为我们的争执已经结束了呢
I thought we'd put an end to our squabbling.

367
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:49,804
Moritimer对我来说
Mortimer is just as much my brother

368
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:52,874
跟你和Georgie一样亲
as you and Georgie.

369
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:54,977
不用担心 兄弟们
Don't worry, dear brother,

370
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:56,141
我知道我不受欢迎
I know where I'm not welcome

371
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:58,188
那干嘛还来拜访我们
Why visit us at all.

372
00:21:58,257 --> 00:21:59,554
是你离开了我们
You disowned us.

373
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,217
还是你已经忘了?
Or have you have forgotten?

374
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,623
Beth 这样就行了
It will be all right now, Beth,

375
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:04,218
你可以去就寝了
if you wish to retire.

376
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,660
Tregennis先生今晚会住在这里吗?
Is Mr. Tregennis staying with us tonight?

377
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:07,891
怎么了?
Why?

378
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:10,092
Porter夫人 你也不愿意我在这里吗?
Do you also object to my presence, Mrs. Porter?

379
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:11,863
Mortimer
Mortimer!

380
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:16,963
我想知道我用不用给你的房间通风
I want to know should I air your room, sir?

381
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:21,435
抱歉
Sorry.

382
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:25,912
谢谢你 Beth
Thank you, Beth.

383
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:27,382
这样就可以了
That'll be quite all right.

384
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:30,351
Tregennis不会留宿的
Mr. Tregennis will not be staying.

385
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,886
好的 Brenda小姐
Very good, Miss Brenda.

386
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:34,615
你们习惯于
Is it customary to have a fire in the room

387
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,282
这个时节在屋里点火吗?
at this time of year?

388
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,485
外面又湿又冷 福尔摩斯先生
It was a cold and damp night, Mr. Holmes.

389
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:39,925
我倒是觉得
Well I must say I...

390
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:41,963
这里是湿热
I thought it was rather humid.

391
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:43,861
我有轻微的血症
Oh I suffer with a mild blood disorder,

392
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,957
在温暖的夜晚也会觉得寒冷
feel the cold on even warm nights.

393
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:47,558
我知道你的感觉
I know how you feel.

394
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:49,831
Porter夫人
Awe, Mrs. Porter,

395
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:51,633
你今早来的时候
was the door to this room closed

396
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:53,172
门是锁着的吗?
when you left this morning?

397
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,333
当然 先生
Oh certainly, sir.

398
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:06,013
...夜莺在山谷下歌唱
...Nightingale as they sing in the valley below.

399
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,222
歌唱...
As they sing...

400
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,363
安置好他们后 我把窗户大开
When they were covered I threw wide the window

401
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:30,238
让早晨的空气透进来
to let in the morning air.

402
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,072
然后我跑到小路上
Then I run down to the lane

403
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:37,877
叫了个农夫去找大夫
and sent a farm lad for the doctor.

404
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,009
接下来的我想你已经知道了 先生
And the rest I think you know, sir.

405
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,789
Porter夫人说得对
Mrs. Porter's right.

406
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,029
她的确很美
She's very beautiful.

407
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:52,586
是啊 但有什么被遗漏了
Yes but something's missing.

408
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:55,063
Tregennis绝对没有轻微的血症
Tregennis is lying about a mild blood disorder;

409
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,456
我以我的名誉担保
I'll state my reputation on that.

410
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:58,175
是吗?
Was he?

411
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:24,017
华生
Watson.

412
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:25,320
华生
Watson.

413
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,596
看这个
Look at this.

414
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,328
这很罕见
That's very unusual.

415
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,274
这不可能
It won't do!

416
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:43,570
这不可能
It won't do!

417
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:45,202
三个人因为某种有意
Three people grievously stricken

418
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,305
或无意的人类行动 而受到极度惊吓
by some conscious or unconscious human agency.

419
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:52,617
那么
Now,

420
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:55,677
事件确切发生在什么时候呢?
when exactly did this event occur?

421
00:24:55,756 --> 00:24:59,053
他们打完牌
They're finished playing cards.

422
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,150
已经过了他们通常就寝的时间
It was past their usual hour for bed.

423
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:02,715
椅子并没有
The panel of the chairs

424
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:03,816
被推到桌子下面
had not been pulled back from the table.

425
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,887
那么应该就在
Then it must have been

426
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,864
Tregennis离开之后不久
only moments after Tregennis left the house.

427
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:09,628
对
Exactly.

428
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:13,765
当然 你一定注意到了
Your conscious, of course,

429
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:15,099
我设法得到了
I've managed to obtain

430
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:16,721
他的清晰脚印
a clear imprint of his foot.

431
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:18,939
嗯 看见了
Yes I saw.

432
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:26,037
得到了他的脚印
Haven got a sample print

433
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:28,880
我就能从其他脚印中鉴别出他的
I could pick out his tracks among the others

434
00:25:28,953 --> 00:25:31,547
从而判断他的行踪
and follow his boots.

435
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:34,181
根据他的步幅
For the length of his stride

436
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:38,819
他很快就回到了牧师家中
he returns swiftly to the vicarage.

437
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:40,589
Tregennis离开后
Tregennis disappeared

438
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:42,183
几乎立刻
then almost instantly

439
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:45,924
某人就让兄妹三人受了惊吓
some other person affected the card players.

440
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,265
我们该如何推测这个人是谁呢?
How can we reconstruct that person?

441
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:51,897
华生 有什么确凿证据证明
But is there any evidence really, Watson

442
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:55,067
的确有人爬上了窗户吗?
that anyone did creep up to that window?

443
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,873
唯一的暗示来自于Tregennis
The only suggestion comes from Tregennis,

444
00:25:57,946 --> 00:26:00,057
说他哥哥感觉
who says that his brother reacted

445
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:02,814
花园里有动静
to some movement in the garden.

446
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:04,372
那这种恐怖
Then how was this

447
00:26:04,452 --> 00:26:07,097
是如何散布的?
impression of horror conveyed?

448
00:26:14,128 --> 00:26:17,529
你就是那个侦探 夏洛克 福尔摩斯?
You're Mr. Sherlock Holmes the detective.

449
00:26:17,598 --> 00:26:19,657
你就是 Leon Sterndale医生
And you are Doctor Leon Sterndale,

450
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:21,290
伟大的猎狮者
the great lion-hunter

451
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:23,097
以及著名的非洲探险家
and famous African explorer.

452
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,136
有什么进展吗?
Have you made any progress?

453
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:26,637
一些
Some.

454
00:26:26,706 --> 00:26:28,366
本郡警方全然错误
The county police are utterly at fault.

455
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,702
告诉我关于Tregennis一家的事件
Tell me what you know

456
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:32,538
你知道些什么
about the fate of the Tregennis family.

457
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:35,875
Sterndale医生 你为什么感兴趣呢?
What is your interest, Dr. Sterndale?

458
00:26:35,948 --> 00:26:39,213
希望我这样说你能相信
My claim to be taken into your confidence

459
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:42,116
由于我常常居于此地
is that during my many residences here

460
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:43,484
对于Tregennis一家
I have come to know

461
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:45,351
很了解
this family of Tregennis very well.

462
00:26:45,423 --> 00:26:48,984
事实上从我同是康沃尔人的母亲这边算来
Indeed upon my Cornish mother's side

463
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,925
他们是我的表亲
I may call them cousins.

464
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:52,519
所以他们的不幸遭遇
So their strange fate

465
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:55,656
自然使我很震惊
has naturally been a great shock to me.

466
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:57,358
你知道任何能够
Do you know of anything

467
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:59,129
帮助我们调查的事情吗?
that could help us out in the inquiry?

468
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,328
没有
Nothing at all.

469
00:27:01,405 --> 00:27:03,565
可以告诉你 我得到消息的时候
I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth

470
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,004
正在Plymouth
upon my way to Africa

471
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:06,734
本打算前往非洲
when news reached me.

472
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:08,037
但我直接回到这里
I came straight back here

473
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:10,204
来看看我有什么能帮忙的
to help in any way I can.

474
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:18,948
你误了船期了吗?
Did you lose your boat?

475
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:23,514
我会乘下一班
I will take the next.

476
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:25,559
这真是深厚的友谊啊
That is friendship indeed.

477
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:28,118
我说过了 我们是亲戚
I tell you they were relatives.

478
00:27:28,197 --> 00:27:30,096
你的行李已经上船了吗?
Did your baggage go on with boat?

479
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:31,153
一些
Some of it,

480
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,325
但还有一些在旅馆里
but most of it remained in the hotel.

481
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,563
显然这个事件不会出现在
Well surely this event could not have

482
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:38,697
Plymouth的晨报上
found its way into the Plymouth morning papers.

483
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:40,296
是的 先生
No, sir

484
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:41,840
我接到了电报
I received a telegram.

485
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:43,843
谁发的?
From whom?

486
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:46,538
你真会刨根问底啊 福尔摩斯先生
You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.

487
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:49,546
这是我的工作
It is my business.

488
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:51,606
Roundhay牧师发的电报
The vicar, Mr. Roundhay sent it,

489
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:54,482
叫我回来
recalling me back.

490
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:56,020
了解了
I see.

491
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:58,421
我可以问一下你是否
May I ask if your suspicions

492
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:02,187
有特别怀疑的对向?
point in any particular direction?

493
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:10,298
我很难回答
Well I can hardly answer that.

494
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:13,166
那这是在浪费我的时间了
Then I'm wasting my time.

495
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:37,549
在缺少线索的情况下动脑思考
To work the brain without sufficient material

496
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:39,093
就像是引擎空转
is like racing an engine,

497
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:43,155
它自己就会分崩离析
it cracks itself to pieces.

498
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:44,996
在住处等我
Wait for me at the cottage.

499
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:46,295
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

500
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:48,165
高兴点 华生
Cheer up, Watson!

501
00:28:48,238 --> 00:28:51,934
海风 阳光 耐性
Sea air, sunshine, patience,

502
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:54,288
一切都会真相大白
all will be revealed.

503
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:40,784
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes!

504
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:42,252
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

505
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,787
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

506
00:29:43,855 --> 00:29:46,948
福尔摩斯先生 我们是鬼上身了
Mr. Holmes, we are devil ridden, Mr. Holmes.

507
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:51,620
我这可怜的教区是鬼上身了
My poor parish is devil-ridden!

508
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:53,856
怎么了?
What has happened?

509
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,962
约三小时前死亡
Dead about three hours I'd say.

510
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,938
症状与Brenda Tregennis完全相同
Same symptoms exactly as Brenda Tregennis.

511
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:05,439
四肢抽搐 手指扭曲
Limbs convulsed, fingers contorted

512
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:08,945
就像死于突发的恐惧
as though he died from a very paroxysm of fear.

513
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:12,447
这不该发生在我的屋檐下
That it should happen under my roof.

514
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:14,107
他睡过了吗?
Has his bed been slept in?

515
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:16,275
是的 应该是
Oh yes, most definitely.

516
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,730
谁打开的窗户?
Who opened this window?

517
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:11,821
我的管家
My housekeeper,

518
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:14,305
她是今早第一个进入这个房间的人
she was the first into the room this morning.

519
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,150
她现在在哪?
Where is she now?

520
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:18,441
她头疼得很厉害于是卧床休息了
Oh she's taken to her bed with a severe headache,

521
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,374
毫无疑问
no doubt.

522
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:23,845
受惊吓所致
Greatly affected by the shock.

523
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:26,109
对于给您带来的不便
I am most terribly sorry

524
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,263
我感到十分抱歉
to inconvenience you in this way.

525
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,419
我知道你们是来这里度假 但是...
I know you both came to these parts to rest but...

526
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,184
想让福尔摩斯不插手是很难的
It isn't easy with Holmes around.

527
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:35,122
他最喜欢让自己投身于
He likes nothing better than to sink his teeth

528
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:38,092
这种事件
into a problem of this sort.

529
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:39,219
但是两场死亡
But two deaths,

530
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:39,939
华生先生
Doctor Watson,

531
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:42,354
发生在两天之内
in the space of two days.

532
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:43,956
这毫无疑问
This is the work of the devil,

533
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,796
是魔鬼作祟
make no mistake.

534
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:48,268
还是相信已知和切实的东西吧
Put your faith in the known and tangible,

535
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:50,167
Roundhay先生
Mr. Roundhay.

536
00:32:14,027 --> 00:32:15,824
现场没有被破坏过是吗?
I trust nothing has been touched, sir?

537
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:18,126
是的 一切完好如初
No, everything's exactly as it was.

538
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,063
好的
All right then.

539
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:21,464
我需要你和你的管家
I'll need a statement

540
00:32:21,535 --> 00:32:22,967
做一份口供
from you and your housekeeper.

541
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:26,301
警官 我很抱歉她还病着
Master, I'm afraid she's still rather ill.

542
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:28,363
检查下楼上
Check up stairs.

543
00:32:37,516 --> 00:32:39,211
这些人是谁?
Who are these gentlemen?

544
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:40,751
哦 来自伦敦的夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生
Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes

545
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,845
和华生医生
and Doctor Watson from London.

546
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:49,017
我听过您的大名 福尔摩斯先生
I've heard of you Mr. Holmes.

547
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:53,349
如果你能将此事件的调查留给警方 我将不胜感激
I'd appreciate it if you would leave this inquiry to the official police.

548
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:55,863
如您所愿
As you wish.

549
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,630
正是我愿
I do sir.

550
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:00,181
不好意思
I'm sorry.

551
00:33:01,706 --> 00:33:03,469
你能将警官的注意力引到
Would you direct the inspector's attention

552
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,371
楼上的窗户
towards the window upstairs

553
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,931
和桌子上的台灯上吗?
and the lamp on the table?

554
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:09,637
这都是重要线索
Each is suggestive.

555
00:33:09,713 --> 00:33:11,509
有这两样 他们就差不多能得出结论了
Together they are almost conclusive.

556
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:14,482
华生
Watson?

557
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:16,781
下午好
Good afternoon.

558
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:19,014
祝你好运
Good luck.

559
00:34:00,493 --> 00:34:02,619
你到底在做什么?
What on earth are you doing?

560
00:34:02,695 --> 00:34:04,992
实验
An experiment

561
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:07,190
验证一个理论
to test a theory.

562
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:09,234
这不是Tregennis房间的台灯吗?
Isn't that the lamp that was in Tregennis' room?

563
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:11,701
是也不是
Yes and no.

564
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:14,864
我看到你买了个一模一样的
I see you bought an identical one.

565
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,405
我是从村子里
I purchased it from

566
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:18,442
一家可爱的小商铺买的
a delightful little shop in the village.

567
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:21,910
你整个下午就是去那儿了
That's where you've been all afternoon.

568
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:25,972
我们听到的两个事件
There is a single point of resemblance

569
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:27,881
有一个共同之处
in the reports that we've heard.

570
00:34:27,952 --> 00:34:32,581
关键在于第一个发现
Now this concerns of the effect

571
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:36,354
案件的人进入房间时
on the atmosphere of the room

572
00:34:36,427 --> 00:34:39,054
所感觉到的屋内气氛
upon those who first entered it.

573
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:41,255
首先是Richards先生
First Doctor Richards

574
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,491
而后是Porter夫人
then Mrs. Porter.

575
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:45,194
还有Roundhay的管家
And Roundhay's housekeeper

576
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:47,792
今早也病了
was taken ill this morning.

577
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:50,499
每个案件中
In each case

578
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:52,734
都有东西
there is a combustion

579
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:54,798
在房内燃烧
going in the room.

580
00:34:54,877 --> 00:34:57,436
第一个 是炉火
In the first case, a fire.

581
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,707
第二个 是灯
In the second, a lamp.

582
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:01,476
炉火可能是必须的
Now the fire perhaps was necessary

583
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:07,750
但在天色大亮的时候 灯还点着
but the lamp was lit when it was already broad daylight.

584
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:11,023
我将这个灯所耗的油与
The comparison of the oil consumed in this

585
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:15,653
Tregennis的灯做了比较证明了这一点
and Tregennis' lamp proves that point.

586
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:17,424
但 为什么?
But why?

587
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,989
某种物质燃烧
Something was burned

588
00:35:20,068 --> 00:35:22,865
生成某种气体
producing an atmosphere

589
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:26,099
并导致了奇特的中毒效应
and causing a strange toxic affect.

590
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:27,605
第一个案件中
In the first instance,

591
00:35:27,674 --> 00:35:29,266
在Tregennis家里
that of the Tregennis family,

592
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:32,243
这种物质被放在炉火里
a substance was placed in the fire

593
00:35:32,311 --> 00:35:33,868
炉火会使烟雾
and the fire would carry the fumes,

594
00:35:33,946 --> 00:35:36,971
在某种程度上扩散到烟囱里
to some extent, up the chimney.

595
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:38,573
只有Brenda Tregennis
Only Brenda Tregennis,

596
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:39,811
离炉火最近
was closest to the fire,

597
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,614
最后死亡
was killed.

598
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:44,246
她的兄弟表现为精神错乱
Her brothers were exhibiting that lunacy,

599
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:48,985
显然都是毒药的初步作用
which is evidently the first effect of the drug.

600
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,084
当然另外一个案件里
The other case of course

601
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:53,129
是被得逞了
the result was complete.

602
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:55,631
这么说是一种
So it's a poison,

603
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:58,668
燃烧时发生作用的毒药?
which works by combustion?

604
00:35:58,737 --> 00:36:02,467
是的
Yeah.

605
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,006
一个明显的地方就是
The obvious place to look

606
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:05,769
Tregennis房间里
was the smoke-guard of the lamp

607
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:07,435
灯的防烟罩
in Tregennis' room.

608
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:08,943
在那 不出所料
There, sure enough,

609
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:11,207
我发现了一些灰末
I perceived a number of flaky ashes

610
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:14,044
并在灯的边缘发现了一些
and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder,

611
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:16,642
未烧尽的褐色粉末
which had not yet been consumed.

612
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,208
我取走了一半
Half of it I took,

613
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:21,415
留了另一半给警方
the other half I left for the police.

614
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:24,323
我们来看看
We will see

615
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:26,190
能否在我们的灯上
if we can reproduce the same effects

616
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:29,162
产生同样的效果
with our own lamp.

617
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,357
不行 福尔摩斯 这简直是疯了
Oh no, Holmes, that's insane.

618
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:33,992
我不能强迫你留在这里
I cannot force you to stay

619
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:38,061
但是我要找到答案
but I mean to have the answer.

620
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:41,505
当然我要留下
Of course I shall stay.

621
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:44,510
我想我了解我的华生
I thought I knew my Watson.

622
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,480
把门打开好吗?
Would you open the door please?

623
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:59,116
请坐在这里
Now would you like to just sit there?

624
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:11,426
准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

625
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:30,075
福尔摩斯先生 你必须保持清醒
<i>You must stay clear Mr. Holmes</i>

626
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:34,045
否则会被踩在脚下
<i>or be trampled underfoot.</i>

627
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:42,220
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

628
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:44,255
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

629
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,984
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

630
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,961
福尔摩斯 能听见我说话吗?
Holmes, can you hear me?

631
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,588
看在上帝的份上 能听见我吗?
For God's sake can you hear me?

632
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,657
成功!
Done!

633
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,088
谢天谢地你还好
Thank God your all right.

634
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:00,334
这真是愚蠢而危险的行径
That was a stupid and dangerous thing to do.

635
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,464
我们可能会因此丧命
We could have been killed.

636
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,269
这是个不理智的实验
It was an unjustifiable experiment

637
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:09,574
即便是对自己而言 更何况是对朋友
even for myself, doubly so for a friend.

638
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,275
我真的非常抱歉
But really I'm extremely sorry.

639
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:35,810
所有的证据都指向Tregennis
All the evidence points to Tregennis

640
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:37,626
他是第一个案件的罪犯
being the criminal in the first tragedy

641
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:39,896
也是第二个案件的受害者
and victim in the second.

642
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:40,891
是的 如果是其他人进入房间
Yes, if anyone else would have come in

643
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:43,552
那家人就会从桌旁站起来
the family would have certainly risen from the table.

644
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,741
那么Tregennis是自杀?
Then Tregennis' own death was suicide?

645
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:51,777
那是Leon Sterndale
That will be Doctor Leon Sterndale.

646
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:54,912
能请他进来吗 华生?
Would you let him in, Watson?

647
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,723
请进 Sterndale医生
Please come in, Doctor Sterndale.

648
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:07,288
好像你被料到会来
Seems your expected.

649
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:11,064
我一小时前收到你的便条
I had your note about an hour ago.

650
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:13,002
但恕我直言
But let me state directly,

651
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:16,473
我对召唤自己的人向来粗鲁
I don't take kindly to being summoned by anybody.

652
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:20,000
我们还是在这儿谈一下案件情况
I thought it better to discuss the matter here.

653
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,739
没有被偷听的危险
No risk of eavesdropping.

654
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:22,608
我不明白 先生
I fail to see, sir,

655
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:23,969
你所说的
what you can have to speak about

656
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,462
与我私人
which affects me personally

657
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:28,974
密切相关的事情
in the most intimate fashion.

658
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:32,748
Mortimer Tregennis的死
The killing of Mortimer Tregennis.

659
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:38,451
我长期与野人为伴
I have lived so long among savages

660
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,259
不受法律约束
and beyond the law

661
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:42,923
而我已经习惯于
that I've got into the way

662
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,491
自己就是法律
of being a law unto myself.

663
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,563
福尔摩斯先生 你最好还是
You would do well, Mr. Holmes,

664
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,572
不要忘记
to remember that,

665
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,397
我并不想加害于你
for I have no desire to do you any injury.

666
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:53,203
我也不想加害于你
Nor I you,

667
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,175
Sterndale医生
Doctor Sterndale.

668
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,207
最好的证明就是
But surely the clearest proof of it is that,

669
00:40:57,244 --> 00:40:58,507
尽管我知道了一切
knowing what I know,

670
00:40:58,544 --> 00:40:59,409
我找了您
that I have sent for you

671
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:02,077
而不是警察
and not for the police.

672
00:41:02,151 --> 00:41:03,807
如果你是在愚弄我 先生
If this is a bluff upon your part, sir,

673
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,815
那你真是找错实验对象了
you have chosen the wrong man for your experiment.

674
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:08,378
不不 愚弄人的是你
No, no, no the bluff is upon your side

675
00:41:08,456 --> 00:41:10,856
而不是我
not upon mine.

676
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,621
现在我来说说
Now I will tell you the facts

677
00:41:12,694 --> 00:41:15,355
我得出结论的事实依据
upon which my conclusions are based.

678
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,294
你从Plymouth回来时
Of your return from Plymouth,

679
00:41:17,364 --> 00:41:18,888
把一些行李
allowing much of your property

680
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:19,600
运到了非洲
to go out to Africa,

681
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:22,051
这提醒了我
I shall say nothing except that it informed me

682
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:24,731
你是构成
was that you were one of the factors,

683
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,397
这一戏剧性事件的
which had to be taken into account

684
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:30,067
重要因素之一
in reconstructing of this drama.

685
00:41:32,478 --> 00:41:33,623
旅馆的这封电报
This telegram from the hotel

686
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,511
证实了你对我所说的
confirms what you told me.

687
00:41:35,582 --> 00:41:37,277
我们上次相遇的时候
Now when we last met

688
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,613
你问我怀疑谁
you asked me whom I suspected

689
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:41,620
而我拒绝回答
and I refused to answer you.

690
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:43,086
接着你就离开了
Then you departed

691
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:44,850
但你并没有回家
but you didn't go home,

692
00:41:44,924 --> 00:41:46,983
没有 Sterndale医生
oh no Doctor Sterndale,

693
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,290
你去了牧师的住处
you went to the vicarage

694
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:52,556
在那儿等了一会儿
and you waited there for some time.

695
00:41:52,631 --> 00:41:53,995
你是怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

696
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:56,659
我跟踪了你
I followed you.

697
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,201
我谁也没看见
I saw no one.

698
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:00,328
我跟踪你
That is what you may expect to see

699
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:02,339
自然不愿被你看见
when I follow you.

700
00:42:02,406 --> 00:42:04,446
你彻夜未眠
You spent a restless night.

701
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:09,340
制定了一个计划
You made certain plans

702
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:10,937
准备第二天
and then in the early hours

703
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:15,040
清晨执行
you proceeded to put them into action.

704
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:18,383
你回到牧师的家
You returned to the vicarage.

705
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:21,083
在悬崖小路上拾了几颗
Collected some distinctive red gravel

706
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:23,955
特别的红色石子
from the cliff path.

707
00:42:28,832 --> 00:42:32,733
天已大亮
The house by now was daylight

708
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:36,531
但屋里还没有动静
but the inhabitants were not stirring.

709
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:38,835
你朝Tregennis的窗户
You threw some of the red gravel

710
00:42:38,908 --> 00:42:41,433
扔了几颗红色石子
up at the window of Tregennis.

711
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,005
Sterndale
Sterndale.

712
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,590
我必须马上跟你谈谈
I must speak with you urgently.

713
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,291
现在?
This hour?

714
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:06,608
门锁着
The doors are locked.

715
00:43:06,646 --> 00:43:07,902
管家拿着钥匙
The housekeeper has the keys.

716
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:11,193
这事至关重大
It is of the utmost importance!

717
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:23,213
你从开着的窗子进去
You entered through the sitting window.

718
00:43:23,282 --> 00:43:26,250
你们进行了很短的会谈
You had an interview, a short one,

719
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,983
你在屋子里来回踱步
and you walked up and down the room.

720
00:43:32,057 --> 00:43:34,546
他对你的到来害怕了
He withdrew as you had come.

721
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:38,360
你当时穿着和现在脚上
You wearing the same pair of studied walking shoes,

722
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:42,230
一样的步行鞋
which at the present moment are upon your feet

723
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:47,678
而Mortimer Tregennis死了
and Mortimer Tregennis was dead.

724
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:57,543
你送给Brenda Tregennis的戒指
The ring you gave Brenda Tregennis.

725
00:43:57,613 --> 00:44:00,080
是的
Yes.

726
00:44:02,785 --> 00:44:04,513
是的
Yes.

727
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:10,751
Brenda Tregennis
Brenda Tregennis.

728
00:44:22,436 --> 00:44:25,563
多年来我深爱着她
For years I loved her.

729
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:30,041
她也深爱着我
For years she loved me.

730
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:34,810
这就是人们所惊奇的
There is the secret of the Cornish seclusion,

731
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:39,647
我隐居在康沃尔的秘密所在
which people so marveled at.

732
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,311
这样我才能接近
It brought me close to

733
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:43,822
这个世界上
the one person on this earth

734
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,758
我最心爱的人
who was dear to me.

735
00:44:48,637 --> 00:44:50,589
我不能娶她
I couldn't marry her,

736
00:44:50,662 --> 00:44:54,090
尽管妻子离开我多年
for I had a wife who left me for whom,

737
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:57,196
但因为英格兰可悲的法律
by the deplorable laws of England,

738
00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:00,726
我不能离婚
I could not divorce.

739
00:45:00,805 --> 00:45:03,932
多年来Brenda一直等待着
For years Brenda waited.

740
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:08,171
多年来我一直等待着
For years I waited.

741
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:14,992
然而这竟是我们等来的结果
And this is what we waited for.

742
00:45:19,189 --> 00:45:21,281
Roundhay知道这秘密
Roundhay knew.

743
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:22,538
我们信任他
He was in our confidence,

744
00:45:22,574 --> 00:45:25,324
因此他拍电报到Plymouth告诉我
hence his telegram to me at Plymouth.

745
00:45:25,395 --> 00:45:30,957
当我得知心上人
What was my baggage or Africa to me

746
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:32,796
遭此不幸时
when I learned that such a fate

747
00:45:32,868 --> 00:45:36,633
行李和非洲对我又算得了什么呢?
had befallen my darling?

748
00:45:36,705 --> 00:45:39,299
你就是这么得知我
There you have the missing clue

749
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,987
不为人知的秘密吧 福尔摩斯先生
to my actions, Mr. Holmes.

750
00:45:54,756 --> 00:45:55,843
我知道你 先生
I understand that you sir,

751
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,956
你是位医生?
are a doctor of medicine?

752
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:03,259
你听过'Radix pedis diaboli'这种制剂吗?
Have you ever heard of 'Radix pedis diaboli'?

753
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,456
魔鬼脚跟
Devils foot root.

754
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:09,126
没有 从未听过
No I can't say that I have.

755
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:11,695
这不能怪你的专业知识
Well there's no reflection upon your professional knowledge

756
00:46:11,732 --> 00:46:15,445
我相信 除了放在Buda某实验室的一份
for I believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda,

757
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:18,236
欧洲再没有其他样本了
there is no other specimen in Europe.

758
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:22,935
这被西非某些地区的医师用作
It is used as an ordeal poison by the medicine men

759
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:26,047
刑讯的毒药
in certain districts of West Africa

760
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:30,520
并被严加保管
and it is kept as a secret by them.

761
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,550
你已经知道很多事了 福尔摩斯先生
You already know so much, Mr. Holmes;

762
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:39,820
但还是让我把全部事实告诉你为好
it is clearly to my interest that you should know all.

763
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,399
我已经解释过
I have already explained

764
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:47,621
我和Tregennis家族的关系
the relationship in which I stood

765
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,561
他们家曾因财产而发生过争吵
to the Tregennis family.

766
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,664
因此与Mortimer疏远了
There had been quarrel about money,

767
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:55,199
他是个阴险狡诈的家伙
which estranged this man Mortimer,

768
00:46:55,278 --> 00:46:57,212
但因为Brenda的缘故
a sly, subtle, scheming man,

769
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,612
我对她的哥哥很友善
but for Brenda's sake

770
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:01,649
几周前的一天
I was friendly with her brother.

771
00:47:01,717 --> 00:47:03,776
他来到我的住处
Then one day a few weeks ago

772
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:07,788
我给他展示了一些非洲珍奇
he came to my cottage

773
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:09,721
除了别的
and I showed him some of my African curiosities.

774
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:13,282
我还给他展示了"魔鬼之足"
Among other things,

775
00:47:13,362 --> 00:47:15,124
这是毒药?
I exhibited the Devil's foot.

776
00:47:15,196 --> 00:47:16,891
难以置信
Poison you say?

777
00:47:16,965 --> 00:47:19,297
你没试过不会相信的
Fascinating.

778
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:21,562
一点点就能够致命
You wouldn't think so if you were to try it.

779
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:23,365
这种粉末
The smallest amount could be fatal.

780
00:47:23,437 --> 00:47:26,633
在燃烧时会即刻反应
In this powder form

781
00:47:26,707 --> 00:47:28,334
刺激大脑中枢
it reacts instantaneously when burned.

782
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:31,401
控制恐惧情感的区域
It stimulates those brain centers,

783
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:34,538
非疯即死
which control the emotion of fear.

784
00:47:34,614 --> 00:47:36,878
那些不幸的本地人
Madness or death

785
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:38,975
若是遭受部落医师的折磨
is the fate of the unfortunate native

786
00:47:39,052 --> 00:47:41,316
就是这样的下场
who is subjected to the ordeal

787
00:47:41,388 --> 00:47:43,878
会被发现吗?
by the priest of his tribe.

788
00:47:43,957 --> 00:47:47,585
欧洲科学是不能的
Can it be detected?

789
00:47:47,661 --> 00:47:49,094
几天后
Not by European science.

790
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:51,254
我的住处有人闯空门
A few days later

791
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:53,890
但貌似什么都没拿
my cottage was broken into

792
00:47:53,966 --> 00:47:55,796
我没有留意
but since nothing seemed to have been taken

793
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:57,664
直到Roudhay先生的电报
I gave the matter no heed

794
00:47:57,735 --> 00:47:59,635
到达Plymouth
until Mr. Roundhay's telegram

795
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:03,231
Mortimer这个恶棍
arrived at Plymouth.

796
00:48:03,308 --> 00:48:04,774
以为我得知消息的时候
This villain, Mortimer,

797
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:06,571
已经在海上
had thought that I would be at sea

798
00:48:06,645 --> 00:48:10,478
并一去非洲很多年
before news reached me,

799
00:48:10,548 --> 00:48:13,539
但我当然立刻回来
and that I should be lost for years in Africa.

800
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:16,177
我一听到详细情况
But of course I returned immediately

801
00:48:16,253 --> 00:48:18,483
就能断定
and I could not hear the details

802
00:48:18,556 --> 00:48:21,588
他用的正是我的毒药
without being assured that it was my poison, which had been used,

803
00:48:22,189 --> 00:48:25,224
而Mortimer Tregennis本人
and that Mortimer Tregennis himself

804
00:48:25,295 --> 00:48:28,821
就是凶手
was the murderer.

805
00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:33,197
我一心要报仇
My sole cried out for revenge.

806
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:35,794
你杀了她!
You murdered her!

807
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,397
为了钱你杀了自己的亲妹妹!
For money you murdered your own sister.

808
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:41,443
你没有证据
You can't prove that.

809
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:43,977
当地陪审团不会相信你
No jury in the land will believe you.

810
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,843
我就是陪审团 Tregennis
I'm my own jury, Mr. Tregennis.

811
00:48:46,915 --> 00:48:52,285
法官 陪审团和刽子手
Judge, jury and executioner.

812
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:19,271
我点燃了台灯
I lit the lamp.

813
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:21,677
把粉末放到上面
I put the powder above it.

814
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:43,564
五分钟后他死了
In five minutes he died.

815
00:49:43,635 --> 00:49:44,554
上帝啊
My God!

816
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:46,755
死状其惨
How he died!

817
00:49:48,472 --> 00:49:53,135
但我不为所动
But my heart was flint,

818
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:54,869
因为他仅仅是经历了
for he endured nothing

819
00:49:54,945 --> 00:49:56,605
我无辜的心上人
which my innocent darling

820
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:59,080
之前所经历的一切
had not suffered before him.

821
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:10,451
你可以采取任何行动 福尔摩斯先生
You can take what steps you like, Mr. Holmes.

822
00:50:10,526 --> 00:50:13,289
但没有什么谁
But there can be no man living

823
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:17,526
会比我现在更无惧死亡了
who fears death less than I do now.

824
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,208
你原本是怎么计划的?
What where your plans?

825
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:34,270
我打算把自己葬在中非
I was intending to bury myself in Central Africa.

826
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:37,112
那儿的工作只进行了一半
My work there is but half done.

827
00:50:44,658 --> 00:50:47,165
那就去完成另外一半吧
Go and do the other half.

828
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:54,722
我个人不打算阻止你
I, for one, am not prepared to stop you.

829
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:05,532
上帝保佑你
God bless you,

830
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:07,942
你们两位
both of you.

831
00:51:18,214 --> 00:51:21,016
已经不是第一次了 福尔摩斯
Not for the first time, Holmes,

832
00:51:21,092 --> 00:51:24,959
把法律玩弄于股掌之上
you presume to take the law into your hands.

833
00:51:28,098 --> 00:51:31,294
我从未爱过
I have never loved

834
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:33,801
但如果有过
but if I did

835
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,599
如果这个我爱的女人
and if the woman I had loved

836
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:37,605
遭此不幸
had met with such an end

837
00:51:37,673 --> 00:51:40,038
我可能也会跟我们
I might act even as our

838
00:51:40,109 --> 00:51:44,339
无视法律的猎狮者有相同的举动
lawless lion-hunter has done.

839
00:51:44,414 --> 00:51:47,143
你不会吗?
Wouldn't you?

840
00:51:47,216 --> 00:51:50,241
嗯 可能吧
Yes, I suppose so

841
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:51,978
但这不是关键
but that's not the point.

842
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:55,316
关键是我为什么要做警方的工作呢?
The point is why should I do the work of the official police?

843
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:59,052
而且正如你所言
And as your very fond of telling me,

844
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:01,890
我在休假中
I'm on holiday!

845
00:52:00,498 --> 00:52:02,566
