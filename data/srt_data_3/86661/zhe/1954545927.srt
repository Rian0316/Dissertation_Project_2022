先生 Savage先生
Mr. Savage, sir,

6
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,730
我不知道(您要出门) 先生
I didn't know, sir.

7
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:39,053
我不知道
Sir, I didn't know.

8
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,936
没关系的 Benson
It's all right, Benson,

9
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:42,922
临时决定的
last minute decision.

10
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,628
哦 你在这儿啊
Oh, there you are.

11
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,277
早上好 Adelaide
Adelaide, good morning.

12
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:38,733
Victor去哪啦?
Where has Victor gone?

13
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:40,014
Victor?
Victor?

14
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:41,232
Victor
Victor.

15
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:43,294
不要装作你不知道
Please don't pretend you are ignorant of where he is.

16
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:44,955
我是我表弟的监护人么?
Am I my cousin's keeper?

17
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:47,503
要是你告诉我他去哪了 我会很感激你的
I shall be obliged that you would tell me where he has gone.

18
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,519
我知道他要去干什么
I know what he's gone to do.

19
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:50,527
但他去了哪里呢?
Where has he gone?

20
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,413
你应该比我更容易知道这一点吧 亲爱的
You have the advantage of me, my dear.

21
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:55,886
我还想着今早和他 去看看家里的农场呢
I was expecting to walk over to home farm with him this morning.

22
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:57,846
你就一点不同情我们么?
Have you no pity for us?

23
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:01,086
是你怂恿他过这种噩梦似的生活
You encouraged him into this nightmarish life.

24
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,721
我"同情"你
I pity for you

25
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:08,077
和你可爱的孩子们
at Somerleigh House

26
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:09,293
在Somerleigh庄园
with your lovely children,

27
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:10,725
你们彼此之间相亲相爱
the love you have for each other.

28
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,547
他到底去哪里了?
Where has he gone?

29
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,733
看得出我不受欢迎
I can see I am unwelcome,

30
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:18,840
恐怕只是因为些不经意的错误
some unwitting fault I fear.

31
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:20,466
我应该回城里去
I shall return to town

32
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,697
好给你留个清净
and leave you in peace.

33
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,372
-Hudson太太 -华生医生
-Oh, Mrs. Hudson. -Oh, Dr. Watson.

34
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,549
我们都很想你
We have been missing you.

35
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:36,977
噢 是么 才10天没见
Oh yeah, only another 10 days.

36
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:38,925
是啊
Yes.

37
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,021
早上好 福尔摩斯
Morning, Holmes.

38
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:48,222
别要我评论你的新领带
Don't ask me to comment on your new tie.

39
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,995
真够无情的 福尔摩斯
Quite heartless, Holmes.

40
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:03,298
那个女人无疑是想到这来
That woman is undoubtedly coming here.

41
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:04,725
她一直盯著这扇窗户
She's been staring up at this window

42
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:05,974
已经有三分钟了
for the past three minutes.

43
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,450
我真希望她能下定决心
Oh, I do wish she'd make up her mind.

44
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:12,072
我会让Hudson太太给她多加只杯子的
I could ask Mrs. Hudson to bring up an extra cup.

45
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,498
很漂亮 不是么?
Handsome, isn't she?

46
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:14,551
谁?
Who?

47
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:18,335
一定是什么重要的事
It must be something of importance

48
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:21,746
才让她犹豫了这么久
to make her hesitate so long,

49
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,391
一个委托人?
A client?

50
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,043
还好么 Polly?
Alright, Polly?

51
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:53,810
真是个可人儿
There's a good girl.

52
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:11,426
Savage先生 我是John Gedgrave
Mr. Savage, John Gedgrave.

53
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:12,950
你怎么才来啊?
Where the devil have you been?

54
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:17,344
先生 先预付2镑
Two pounds, Mr. Savage, in advance

55
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:19,049
事成之后再付3镑
and three for the establishment,

56
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,863
一共是5英镑
five in total.

57
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,079
希望能值这个价
Hope it's worth it.

58
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,281
您用的匿名
Oh, anonymous was the word you used.

59
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:26,893
我们去的这地方
Where we're going is as anonymous

60
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:28,517
也不可能被人发现的
as you'll ever find.

61
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,095
每个小隔间
Every compartment

62
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,900
都还有帘子挡著
has a curtain even.

63
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,115
没人会看到您的
No one will see you,

64
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:34,476
哦 上帝啊
oh good Lord,

65
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:37,260
您没都带着吧 是不是?
you're not taking these with you, are you?

66
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:38,310
不用带着?
No?

67
00:06:38,383 --> 00:06:40,531
哦 不 当然不用
Oh, no, no, no, no.

68
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:42,165
或许应该把它们撕碎了
May as well tear them up

69
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:45,024
扔到泰晤士河里
and drop them in the Thames.

70
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:46,419
四十镑
Forty pounds,

71
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:48,892
我会给您开张收据的
I'll give you a receipt.

72
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:54,990
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

73
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,087
应该是我们漂亮的客人
That will be our fair visitor.

74
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,138
请坐吧
Please, do sit down.

75
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,450
Gedgrave 这张收据
This receipt Gedgrave.

76
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:44,287
怎么啦?
What about it?

77
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,778
你在玩什么把戏?
What are you playing at?

78
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,102
签的名是Carter
You signed it Carter.

79
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:48,947
您不会是希望我在做这类事情的时候
You don't expect me to use my real name

80
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,007
还要用我的真名吧?
doing this sort of work, do you?

81
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:53,155
Carter就是我的真名
Carter's my real name.

82
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,598
我本来可以随便写个名字
I could have signed anything

83
00:07:55,675 --> 00:08:00,825
我信任您才用真名的 Savage先生
but I entrusted you with my real name, Mr. Savage.

84
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:03,674
您就别再抱怨了
Please don't complain.

85
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:17,011
我需要您的帮助
I need your help.

86
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,604
我是...
I am...

87
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:24,185
您在这里所说的一切
Anything you say here will of course

88
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:25,894
我们都会严格的保守秘密
be treated in the strictest confidence.

89
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:29,305
我们还替国王们保守着秘密呢 夫人
We have kept the secrets of kings, madam.

90
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,621
我...
I...

91
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:36,267
我丈夫...
My husband...

92
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:12,292
我丈夫是个金融家
My husband is a financier.

93
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:15,006
您一定听过牛津伦巴德银行吧?
You have heard of the Oxford and Lombard Bank?

94
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,749
是的
Yes.

95
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:19,783
Conyers家族是其主要股东
The chief shareholders are the Conyers?

96
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,935
我丈夫的母亲就属于这一家族
My husband's family on his mother's side.

97
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,484
我丈夫是主要董事之一
He is one of the directors.

98
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,665
他完全胜任这个工作
The job is well within his powers, only...

99
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:32,901
但他发现这工作越来越令人厌烦
Victor has found the work increasingly irksome.

100
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:35,939
他怀抱着一种志向
He entertains an ambition, you see,

101
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:38,788
虽然家里人都无法理解
which none of his family would begin to understand.

102
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:40,921
什么志向?
What is that?

103
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:43,106
他想成为一个诗人
He wishes to be a poet.

104
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:49,503
他开始相信
He's come to believe

105
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,812
吸食鸦片能获得灵感
that opium heightens his powers,

106
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:54,959
让他的感觉更敏锐
intensifies the evidence of his senses.

107
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:19,697
这可能能起到临时的作用
This may be so temporarily,

108
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,794
但我想您肯定知道
but as I'm sure you know

109
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:22,592
只有在最开始几次吸食时
the effect only survives

110
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,017
才有这种效果
the first few times the drug is taken.

111
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,860
是这样么?
That is so, is it not?

112
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,562
是的 完全正确
Oh, yes, indeed.

113
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,102
接下来很快就会上瘾
Addiction quickly follows,

114
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:30,564
越来越频繁
very often for life.

115
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:34,124
这种恶魔般的物质 很快就只会使人沉醉其中
The infernal substance soon offers the addict nothing

116
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,977
除了在无法吸食时 感到难以忍受以外别无他用
except relief from the terrible effects of its absence.

117
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:43,296
我相信Victor马上就要成瘾了
I believe Victor stands on the threshold of addiction.

118
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:45,358
他今早留给我一张便条
He left a note for me this morning

119
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,951
似乎他明白自己处在何种危险之中
which suggests he knows what danger he's in.

120
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,619
您要走了么?
You are going?

121
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,685
很清楚 在这件事情上 华生医生才是您应该去咨询的人
Well clearly Dr. Watson is the person to consult for the matter.

122
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:54,800
不 福尔摩斯先生 不是的
No, Mr. Holmes, no,

123
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:56,846
不光是这些
there is much more to it then that.

124
00:10:57,793 --> 00:11:00,712
有一位Culverton Smith先生
There is Mr. Culverton Smith.

125
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:01,797
Culverton Smith?
Culverton Smith?

126
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,288
Victor的表兄
Victor's cousin.

127
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:06,768
他肯定是起了什么坏的影响
He's a malign influence.

128
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:09,694
是他把Victor逼到这份上的
I am sure he's driven Victor to this

129
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,520
我确信他这么做另有目的
and I am certain he's done it for his own ends.

130
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,166
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

131
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,773
马车就停在街角
The cab's on the corner.

132
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,970
我希望这次不是白费力气
I do hope this is not a wild goose chase.

133
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:43,468
怎么可能呢?
How can it be?

134
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:44,811
好吧
Well,

135
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:50,356
我想那个漂亮姑娘把你 迷的晕头转向 谢谢
I think you've had your head turned by a pretty woman, thank you.

136
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:52,622
对了 关于Culverton Smith 有什么情况?
Oh yes, what about Culverton Smith?

137
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:53,759
我调查过他了
I looked him up.

138
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,558
Culverton Smith在东方的时候
Culverton Smith did some important medical work

139
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,185
从事过重要的医学工作
while he was in the east.

140
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:00,143
他拓宽了科学的领域
He pushed back the boundaries of science.

141
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:06,761
但是 他却不得不自费发表他的发现
However, he was obliged to publish his findingsat his own expense.

142
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,262
为什么?
Why?

143
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:11,722
他只是个业余爱好者
He's an amateur

144
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:15,303
那些专家们又很嫉妒
and the professionals are jealous.

145
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,108
我明白为什么他使你感兴趣了
Well I can see why he interests you.

146
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,343
你那些神秘的客人
Ah, your mystery guests.

147
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:34,119
他们都是谁?
Who are they?

148
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:37,995
我可不愿意让Carnac上校 成为唯一的名人
I couldn't let Colonel Carnac be the only celebrity.

149
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:41,764
我不是因为他有名才请他的 亲爱的
I don't want him at our table because he's a celebrity, my darling.

150
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:43,910
纯粹是因为他有钱
It's just that he's horribly rich,

151
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,570
或者说他妻子非常有钱
or rather his wife is,

152
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:49,296
他们都把钱存在牛津伦巴德银行
and they bank with the Oxford and Lombard.

153
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:52,673
我个人觉得没有比 在餐桌上猎取奇闻异事更糟的了
Personally I can't think of anything worse then hunting stories all through dinner.

154
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,079
我也这么觉得
Nor I.

155
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:58,719
所以我说服一位很有趣的猎人 也来加入我们
So I've persuaded a rather more interesting hunter to join us.

156
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:02,842
是谁? 不要捉弄我 Addy
Who is it? Don't tease, Addy.

157
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:07,110
歇洛克 福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes.

158
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:10,597
要我说 这可真是出乎意料
I say, that is something of a coup,

159
00:13:10,754 --> 00:13:12,178
好极了
well done.

160
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,216
看 Culverton Smith也来了
Oh look, Culverton Smith's here too.

161
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:19,850
真高兴你又能邀请他 Addy 我亲爱的
I'm so glad you felt able to invite him again, Addy darling.

162
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:21,683
看看他
Look at him.

163
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:24,776
大家都会觉得Somerleigh是他的
Anyone would think Somerleigh was his.

164
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:27,407
我很不喜欢这样
I do dislike it.

165
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,666
-歇洛克 福尔摩斯先生? -是的
-Mr. Sherlock Holmes? -Yes.

166
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,143
我是Culverton Smith
Culverton Smith.

167
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,410
Adelaide告诉我有一位 令人惊喜的客人
Dear Adelaide promised me a surprise guest.

168
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:50,455
我还担心是因为哗众取宠而出名的人呢
I feared it might be somebody who was famous for being famous.

169
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:53,525
我没有料到 是您这种级别的
Someone of your distinction I had not expected at all.

170
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,071
我当然没有你出名
Nor I one of yours.

171
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,471
我?
Mine?

172
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,907
我没权要求这种待遇 福尔摩斯先生
I make no claims to distinction, Mr. Holmes.

173
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:02,096
您过谦了
You are too modest.

174
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:07,420
你写的关于苏门答腊和洪水热的 病理学报告是一部杰作
Your account of the pathology of the Sumatra and River Fever is a masterpiece.

175
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:08,570
谢谢
Thank you,

176
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,249
谢谢
thank you.

177
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:12,421
当然 要让诱饵发挥作用
For a lure to work, of course,

178
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,200
得让动物相信这是安全的
you have to make the animal believe it's safe.

179
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,540
这样就好了
Now that's all very well.

180
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:20,244
但是 动物们对于危险总是很敏感
The animals involved, however, have a highly developed sense of danger.

181
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:24,045
我想福尔摩斯先生对危险也很敏感 是吗 福尔摩斯先生?
I'm sure Mr. Holmes must have that sense, do you Mr. Holmes?

182
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:26,842
是的 我看得出来
Yes, I see it.

183
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,847
那么 你是说侦探
Yes, you mean that the detective

184
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:30,898
可以说是在
could be said to move

185
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:33,316
食肉动物和牺牲品的世界里活动
in a world of predators and victims.

186
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:34,691
我们都是这样的 上校
Oh, we all do that Colonel.

187
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,625
即使是最不起眼的家庭事务律师
Even humble family solicitors.

188
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:41,892
是的 那你给自己树了不少敌吧 福尔摩斯先生
Yes, and you would have enemies, Mr. Holmes,

189
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:42,653
你就没有敌人么?
would you not?

190
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:45,936
对了 我敢说要是
Yes, yes, it would take something I dare say

191
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,845
有人想引福尔摩斯先生上钩然后对付他
to bring Mr. Holmes onto a lure

192
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:49,918
肯定要花很多工夫
and dispatch him.

193
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:52,731
需要仔细研究他的习惯
It would take careful study of his habits

194
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,810
在暗处发动袭击
and half-light shot or worse.

195
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:58,192
必要时甚至要跟踪他
It might even be necessary to follow him

196
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:00,967
一直追到他的老窝里去
up to his lair even.

197
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:04,180
Bertram 安静点
Bertram, be quiet.

198
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:26,297
您没有怎么吃东西 福尔摩斯先生
You're not eating, Mr. Holmes.

199
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,689
有这么多东西要观察
With so much to observe,

200
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:33,350
吃就是次要的了
food becomes of secondary importance.

201
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,967
您都观察出了些什么?
What have you observed so far?

202
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:37,639
勇气
Courage,

203
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:40,786
燥热
fever,

204
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:42,617
贪婪
gluttony,

205
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,052
愤怒
acute irritation,

206
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,542
嫉妒
envy,

207
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,177
机智
wit, intelligence,

208
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:54,013
我是说都是些在英格兰所有大庄园里
I mean just the usual vices and virtues

209
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,807
常见的恶性和美德
with any large English country house.

210
00:15:57,451 --> 00:15:59,754
真是好极了
This is very good.

211
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:09,459
你们知道
Do you know the game

212
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:11,792
"推硬币"的游戏么?
of "shove ha'penny?"

213
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:14,229
这个跟那个很像
Well it's similar.

214
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,669
我把它叫做"地毯滑冰"
I call this one "Rug skatery".

215
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:20,780
我那些把赌博当一回事的朋友
My more serious gambling friends,

216
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:23,479
就是那些股票经纪人
the stock broking fraternity that is to say,

217
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,377
因为把这游戏介绍到自己的居所
have introduced it to their establishments

218
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:27,406
而惹得妻子们非常生气
to the fury of their wives.

219
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:29,169
但是大家都同意
It is agreed, however,

220
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:32,891
论其可靠性来 Somerleigh是最好的
that the authentic Somerleigh version is best.

221
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,642
她压根儿不穿那些东西
And she never wore them at all.

222
00:16:41,214 --> 00:16:44,367
要是我们不鼓动他们去玩那个愚蠢的游戏 男人们会感到苦恼么?
Will the men be mortified if we don't cheer them on at their silly game?

223
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,900
我敢说他们会的
I dare say they will.

224
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,623
这都快成个反面的理由了
It's almost a reason for not doing it.

225
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:52,750
还不是为了和睦
But for the sake of harmony

226
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,040
我们才迁就这些大孩子
We indulge little boys.

227
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:10,951
主人又一次超过了大家的预测
Our host has again out jumped all estimates.

228
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:14,732
-所以律师压对了 -谢谢
-So the lawyer takes the pot. -Thank you.

229
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,084
干得好 Charles
Well done, Charles,

230
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,655
现在该我了
my turn now.

231
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,089
先生们 咱们来赌一把吧
<i>Faites vos jeux, gentlemen</i>

232
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,428
我该把你们最后一次的预测减半
I should halve your estimates of last time.

233
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,012
-妈妈 -没事的
-Mama. -It's quite all right.

234
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:45,085
我家的孩子也一样
My children do that too.

235
00:17:47,956 --> 00:17:49,035
妈妈
Mama.

236
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:58,774
爸爸他怎么啦?
What is wrong with papa?

237
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,341
他抱着我的时候
When he hugged me

238
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:03,395
我觉得很恐怖
he felt horrid.

239
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:06,629
他浑身冰冷 还在发抖
He felt all cold and shivery.

240
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:10,412
你想说什么 宝贝?
What do you mean by that, darling?

241
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:13,002
好像他就快要死了
He felt as if he was dead.

242
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:19,653
别说傻话了
Oh don't be silly.

243
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:29,761
医生!
Doctor!

244
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,200
Smith
Smith.

245
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,684
可怜的家伙
Poor fellow.

246
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:14,507
我没能帮到他 福尔摩斯先生
I could do nothing for him, Mr. Holmes,

247
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:17,647
连我也没帮得到他
not even I.

248
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,702
护士也在尽力照顾
The nursing was all right, too,

249
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,885
真是一出悲剧
a tragic business.

250
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:24,564
有一件事 您能帮助我么?
Will you satisfy me upon one point?

251
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:25,541
当然
Of course.

252
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:28,814
对这种疾病 您知道多少?
This disease, do you know what it was?

253
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:31,635
所有症状都显示这是一种热病
All the signs point to that class of fevers,

254
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:35,916
其中苏门答腊洪水热是最致命的
of which the Sumatran River Fever is the most deadly.

255
00:21:35,997 --> 00:21:38,286
但并不一定就是这种病
It was not necessarily that however.

256
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,441
那也非常接近
Something very like it.

257
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:42,506
我已经建议这个可怜人的尸体
I have advised that the poor fellow's body

258
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:45,175
必须格外小心地来处理
is handled with extreme care.

259
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:48,356
这种疾病是通过皮肤 表面的创口来传播的
It is a disease transmitted through broken skin you see.

260
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:50,422
他们必须最最小心
They cannot be too careful.

261
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,346
Savage怎么会染上这种病?
How did Savage come by such a thing?

262
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:59,307
噢 您可以对此保持谨慎的态度么?
Ah, I can rely on your discretion?

263
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:00,393
当然
Of course.

264
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:04,429
我知道他有时 经常呃
I understand Savage sometimes frequented,

265
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,907
或者这么说 有些事使他必须去
well let's to say his affairs took him

266
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:08,371
Rotherhithe的某个地方
to a part in Rotherhithe

267
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:10,985
那里主要住的都是中国和印度的水手
inhabited mostly by Chinese and Lascars.

268
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:13,382
他肯定是在那里染上这种病的
He must have picked it up there.

269
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,320
应该通知Rotherhithe官方这件事
The authorities in Rotherhithe must be informed.

270
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:17,315
他们会知道的
They will be.

271
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:18,573
但他们会不会采取适当措施
Whether the measures they take

272
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:20,762
那就另当别论了
turn out to be appropriate is another matter.

273
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:22,088
恐怕在大多数机构中的懒惰
Most institutions I'm afraid

274
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:23,930
都可以够得上判刑了
are run by the criminally lazy.

275
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:27,449
我认识Penrose Fisher和几个主管
I know Penrose Fisher and the director a little,

276
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:28,877
我会尽我所能去做的
I'll do what I can.

277
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:31,170
很感激您的关心 福尔摩斯先生
I'm grateful for you interest, Mr. Holmes.

278
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,495
可怜的Adelaide
Poor Adelaide,

279
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:34,589
这打击太沉重了
this will hit her very hard.

00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,059
离开Somerleigh?

00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,886
我必须离开Somerleigh么?
I must leave Somerleigh?

284
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:33,426
一旦遗嘱被确认
As soon as will is proved,

00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:37,320
Culverton Smith就有权要求你离开
Culverton Smith is within his rights to ask you to go.

286
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:39,831
我很抱歉 Adelaide
I'm very sorry, Adelaide.

287
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:43,513
所有这些都是按照Bernard爵士的遗嘱
All this has its origins in Sir Bernard's will.

288
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:44,949
我也有部分责任

00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,657
继承人限于Victor最年长的表兄
This entailment to Victor's oldest cousin of the house

290
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:48,878
继承房屋和其余的...
and the rest of it is...

291
00:23:48,957 --> 00:23:51,663
其余的什么?
The rest of it?

292

从伯克郡产业取得的收入

293
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:57,249
那也要归他么?
That will go to him, too?

294
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:58,697
是的
Yes.

295
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:02,803
天啊 那还能剩下什么?
Dear God, what is left?

296
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,414
足够你个人
Enough for you to live,

297
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:08,166
适度而体面的生活
modestly and respectably.

298
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,786
当然 现在这种生活不能继续了
You will not be able to continue as you have done.

299
00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:14,703
我明白了
No, I see.

300
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,969
要我说 我曾经多次要Victor修改
As I say, I had asked Victor many times

301
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,479
遗嘱里限定继承人的范围
to change the terms of the entail

302
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,024
这样可以让你舒服地过一辈子
to favor you in your lifetime.

303
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:24,154
同时也是完全合法的
It would have been legal of course,

304
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:28,117
这很容易做 但...
easily done but,

305
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:29,689
Victor太年轻了
Victor was young.

306
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,814
当然 Culverton Smith
Surely, Culverton Smith

307
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:34,841
不会行使他的权利去驱逐Savage夫人吧
will not exercise his right to evict Mrs. Savage?

308
00:24:34,913 --> 00:24:36,337
他会的
He might.

309
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:37,479
为什么你这么想?
Why do you think that?

310
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,805
他一直在接触这件事
He's been in touch.

311
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:41,280
似乎也知道主要的遗产如何处理
He seems to know the main dispositions of the will.

312
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,908
他说过对产业的收入
He talked of the estate income

313
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:44,486
要进行恰当的使用
being put to a proper use,

314
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:46,611
不知道具体是指什么
whatever that meant.

315
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:47,998
他似乎认为Adelaide
He seemed to think that Adelaide

316
00:24:48,074 --> 00:24:50,577
可以去依靠她的娘家
would be able to rely on her family.

317
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,240
他们也没有办法
They have no means.

318
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:54,388
当他知道了他就会宽容的
When he knows that he must relent.

319
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:56,347
我很怀疑
I doubt it.

320
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,091
自从进入我们的生活
He's wanted something like this to happen

321
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,232
他就处心积虑要这样
ever since he came into our lives.

322
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:04,045
他总是利用Victor的弱点
He encouraged all that was weakest in Victor

323
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:07,601
希望发生什么不幸
in the hope of some disaster.

324
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:12,019
他现在得偿所愿了
This is a triumph for him.

325
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:15,918
或许值得和他谈谈 Adelaide
It may be worth talking to him, Adelaide.

326
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:18,285
我也觉得是
I suppose so.

327
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:22,715
如果你肯亲自去求他
If you could bring yourself to plead with him.

328
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:29,067
为了孩子 我会那么做的
For the children I will do even that.

329
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,961
Percy 快擦擦鼻子
Oh, Percy, do blow your nose.

330
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,412
现在记住这些都发生在9天前
Now remember all this happened nine days ago.

331
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:40,148
那一天是
That was the day when

332
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:44,120
女王招待苏丹的Kallipur
the Queen entertained the Sultan of Kallipur

333
00:25:44,197 --> 00:25:47,187
也是Frivolous赢得Birkenhead奖金的那一天
and Frivolous won the Birkenhead Stakes.

334
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,593
-是在Goodwood赢的 -没错
-At Goodwood. -Right.

335
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:54,986
Harry 你的靴子呢?
Harry, where are your boots?

336
00:25:55,058 --> 00:25:56,090
我知道了
Oh I see.

337
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:58,250
那就快去Rotherhithe吧
Well then off to Rotherhithe.

338
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,455
祝你们好运
Good luck,

339
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:02,835
祝你们好运
good luck.

340
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:28,190
这个 福尔摩斯
There Holmes,

341
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:29,970
是一份在皮肤表面找到的
that is a list of every blemish

342
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:31,888
全部斑点的清单
I could find on the skin's surface.

343
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:34,111
我猜你要寻找传播途径吧
I presume you're seeking the means of transmission?

344
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,925
是的
Yes.

345
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:37,627
通过皮肤表面的创口
Through broken skin.

346
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:42,302
Culverton Smith也认为是这么传播的
That is how Culverton Smith believes it was transmitted.

347
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:45,779
他的意见当然值得参考
Well his opinion is worth knowing certainly.

348
00:26:49,093 --> 00:26:52,736
Fisher 你觉得这个人怎么样?
What do you think of him, Fisher?

349
00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:54,171
他是你朋友么?
He is a friend of yours?

350
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,358
当然不 我并不了解他
Not at all, I hardly know him.

351
00:26:56,439 --> 00:27:01,199
只是读了他的一些论文 仅此而已
I have read a couple of his papers, that's all.

352
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:02,975
我认为他的工作
Well I think his work,

353
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,628
至少有些部分是很杰出的
in parts, brilliant.

354
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:09,708
要说有什么缺点的话
If he has a fault it is

355
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:12,115
那就是不能接受任何的批评
that he can accept no criticism whatsoever.

356
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,419
我确实发现了一个昆虫叮咬点
I did find an insect bite

357
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,635
但皮肤上再没有其他叮咬的痕迹了
but no other punctures of skin at all.

358
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:19,621
我甚至检查了他的口腔
I even looked inside the mouth.

359
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:22,665
显然没有任何人为的迹象
It seems clear that no human agency was involved.

360
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,875
我猜你是在调查
I assume you're investigating

361
00:27:24,953 --> 00:27:26,411
这种疾病被什么人
the possibility of this disease

362
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:29,191
蓄意传播的可能性
having been passed on deliberately.

363
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,144
和你这样思维严密的人会面
Well what a unique delight

364
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:35,111
真是格外令人愉快
to meet a man with a mind as logical as yours?

365
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:40,791
是他么?
Is this him?

366
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:42,632
是的 福尔摩斯先生?
Uh, yes, Mr. Holmes?

367
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,619
噢 好小子
Ah, bravo Ben.

368
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:45,939
你是?
You are?

369
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:47,368
Gedgrave
Gedgrave,

370
00:27:47,443 --> 00:27:48,902
John Gedgrave
John Gedgrave.

371
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:50,505
我是福尔摩斯
Holmes.

372
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:53,860
这边走
This way.

373
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:58,931
我一看到报纸就认出是他了
Recognized him as soon as I seen the newspaper.

374
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:00,663
肯定是他
That's him all right.

375
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:03,450
你具体都为他干些什么?
How did you come to be acting for him?

376
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:06,446
广告 慎重的绅士需要
Advert, gentleman of discretion required

377
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:08,291
码头礼仪的知识
with knowledge of dock etiquette.

378
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:09,862
码头礼仪?
Dock etiquette?

379
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:13,447
为了知道烟馆附近的路
For knowing your way around the poppy houses, opium.

380
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,926
烟馆 我知道一两个不错的地方
Well I knew one or two of the better places.

381
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:19,290
是Savage登的广告么?
Was the advertisement placed by Savage?

382
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:20,305
不是
No.

383
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,625
那是谁?
Who then?

384
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:22,983
我不知道
I don't know.

385
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,872
Gedgrave先生 你不会对我撒谎吧
Mr. Gedgrave, you wouldn't lie to me would you?

386
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,195
不 绝不会
Oh no.

387
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,600
我是在租来的办公室里见到那个家伙的
It was some fellow I met in a rented office.

388
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,204
给我描述一下他
Describe him for me?

389
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:33,354
我做不到
Well I can't.

390
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:35,239
这么说是什么意思
Well what I mean is,

391
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:37,297
我从来没见过这家伙
I never saw the fellow.

392
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:38,959
他故意不让我看到
He didn't mean me to.

393
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,233
他一直拿灯在我眼前闪来闪去
He kept a light shining in my eyes all the time.

394
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:44,082
真的是这样 这是在什么时候?
Indeed. When was this?

395
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,711
14号
The 14th.

396
00:28:46,282 --> 00:28:47,599
他付钱
He paid all right.

397
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:50,831
要我去和他联系
He told me I was to be contacted and I was,

398
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:53,310
我就去见他了
to meet him.

399
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:54,246
他怎么了
What happened to him?

400
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:55,414
我可不想惹上什么麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

401
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:56,557
为这我才来找你的
That's why I come to you.

402
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,508
你把他带到哪去了?
Where did you take him?

403
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:00,857
公爵巷的一间房子
A house in Duke's Alley.

404
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,292
那可是个好地方
It's a good place.

405
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,896
好?
Good?

406
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:07,000
从来没出过什么问题 真是个好地方
Well, never had any problems there, good place.

407
00:29:07,554 --> 00:29:08,525
他到底怎么了?
What happened to him?

408
00:29:08,526 --> 00:29:09,767
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

409
00:29:09,768 --> 00:29:12,224
对不起我没想...
I'm sorry I didn't...

410
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:14,931
谢谢你 Gedgrave先生 给你添麻烦了
Thank you, Mr. Gedgrave, for your trouble.

411
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,330
随时恭候 福尔摩斯先生 随时
Anytime, Mr. Holmes, anytime.

412
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,674
您真慷慨 先生
Generous of you, sir, generous.

413
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,750
我需要一个Rotherhithe的向导
I will need a guide in Rotherhithe.

414
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:26,510
要是你要去那的话 您可是找对人了
If you want the best places, I'm your man.

415
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,594
不用找别人了
Look no further.

416
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:28,490
明天早上
Tomorrow morning,

417
00:29:29,662 --> 00:29:31,192
十点半怎么样?
10:30?

418
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:32,424
好的
Done.

419
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:37,941
您去红拖鞋俱乐部
The Red Slipper Club.

420
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:40,592
找叫Carter的
Ask for Carter,

421
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:43,210
Frank Carter
Frank Carter.

422
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:47,007
就是你吧 Gedgrave先生
Will that be you, Mr. Gedgrave?

423
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:52,528
Hudson太太
Mrs. Hudson,

424
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:55,617
华生医生可能会留下来吃晚饭
Dr. Watson may be staying for dinner.

425
00:29:57,932 --> 00:29:59,391
华生
Now Watson.

426
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,661
Culverton Smith要把
Culverton Smith means to

427
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:02,181
Savage夫人和她的孩子
throw Mrs. Savage and her children

428
00:30:02,181 --> 00:30:03,579
都从Somerleigh庄园赶出去
out of Somerleigh House.

429
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:04,642
他凭什么那么做?
How is he able to do that?

430
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:06,694
根据一个没有修改的老遗嘱
The house is entailed to him an old will,

431
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:08,056
庄园限定由他来继承
which has never been revised.

432
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,201
那就有趣了
Well that is interesting.

433
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,456
你知道这意味着什么?
You know what this means?

434
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,648
意味着Culverton Smith
It means that Culverton Smith had a motive

435
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:15,259
有了除掉他表弟的动机
for doing away with his cousin.

436
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,867
Savage死了
Savage is dead,

437
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,678
死于一种疾病 偏偏Culverton Smith
killed by a disease in which Culverton Smith

438
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:21,807
是研究该疾病公认的专家
was the acknowledged expert.

439
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:25,325
不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

440
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,691
你是故意装作没有理解我吧?
Are you deliberately trying to misunderstand me?

441
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:29,952
你只不过是指出了一个 值得注意的巧合
You have pointed out a remarkable coincidence,

442
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:31,855
仅此而已
that is all.

443
00:30:32,678 --> 00:30:35,276
不能做出任何的推论
No inferences can be drawn from it.

444
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,818
我们不能容许Savage夫人
We cannot allow Mrs. Savage

445
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:38,386
被那家伙扫地出门
to be thrown into the street by this fellow.

446
00:30:38,457 --> 00:30:40,296
我们也无能为力
We may have to.

447
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:30,951
租办公室的人一定就是Culverton Smith
It must have been Culverton Smith who rented the office.

448
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:33,498
可这证明不了什么
I dare say but it proves nothing.

449
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:35,968
肯定有办法阻止他的 福尔摩斯 肯定有
There must be a way of stopping him, Holmes, surely.

450
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:40,149
我越来越怀疑这一点了
Oh, I doubt it more and more.

451
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,949
如果你认为他有罪
Suppose you were convinced of his guilt.

452
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:46,163
你会怎么做呢?
What would you do then?

453
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:47,227
你知道我的方法的
You know my methods,

454
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:48,692
我会想办法进到庄园里去
I would gain entry to the house.

455
00:31:48,693 --> 00:31:50,689
我该这么去做
Then that's what I shall do.

456
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,518
你不一定非得来的
You don't have to come.

457
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:54,796
然而我还是得来
Nevertheless, I shall.

458
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:57,025
你的脑袋已经转过去了
You already had your head turned.

459
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:00,964
我得保证 你的脖子不会跟着折断
I must make sure you don't get your neck broken as well.

460
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,668
当可怜的Savage相信
Once poor Savage had been convinced

461
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,245
鸦片会为他打开
that opium would open the door

462
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:11,093
诗歌艺术的神秘大门
to the mysteries of the poetic craft,

463
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:14,244
他就落入了Culverton Smith的股掌中 是吧?
Culverton Smith would have had him in his power, wouldn't he?

464
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:17,460
他有意识地利用Savage的负罪感
He traded on Savage's sense of guilt.

465
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:18,928
他知道
He knew that Savage

466
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:20,665
Savage会在远离Somerleigh的地方
would want to continue experimenting with the drug

467
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:23,032
继续吸食鸦片
far away from Somerleigh.

468
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,244
华生 你必须要知道
What you have to face, Watson,

469
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:28,744
表面看来Savage是在Rotherhithe
is that Savage's catching the disease in Rotherhithe

470
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,128
染上这种病的
is entirely plausible,

471
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:34,490
巧的是
The coincidence,

472
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:39,320
Smith是这种病方面的专家
that Smith's expertise in the matter is exactly that,

473
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,274
一个巧合
a coincidence.

474
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:43,323
你不能凭这么个巧合就判他绞刑
You can't hang a man on coincidence.

475
00:33:03,777 --> 00:33:05,545
夫人
Ma'am,

476
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:07,390
夫人
ma'am.

477
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:11,669
我们有理由相信
We have reason to believe that,

478
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,695
事实上
well as a matter of fact

479
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:15,881
您侵入了私人领地
you are trespassing.

480
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,486
警官
Sergeant,

481
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:26,330
我相信你我都清楚
I'm sure you're as aware as I am

482
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:27,961
这个国家关于侵入私人领地的法律
the laws of trespass in this country

483
00:33:28,043 --> 00:33:31,651
是最古怪 甚至离谱的
are most curious not to say odd.

484
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,927
我应该知道
I should know.

485
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:38,758
数百英亩的土地
I have responsibility for hundreds of acres

486
00:33:38,836 --> 00:33:41,720
从我手里被人以貌似合法的手段骗走
which are about to be stolen from me

487
00:33:41,796 --> 00:33:45,439
我有责任
through legal trickery,

488
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:49,758
就是那个人骗走了土地
by that man,

489
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,829
这个人像寄生虫一样
a man who preyed on my husband

490
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:56,545
掠夺着我的丈夫
like some bloated parasite,

491
00:33:56,626 --> 00:34:00,793
腐蚀他 把他推向死亡
corrupted him and drove him to his death.

492
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,820
而现在
And now,

493
00:34:02,894 --> 00:34:05,434
他却不和那个可怜的寡妇
now he will not speak to the woman

494
00:34:05,506 --> 00:34:07,313
说一句话
he has widowed.

495
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:12,597
他当然不会的
Of course he won't,

496
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:17,305
他知道他这一边根本就没有正义
he knows he has no justice on his side.

497
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:20,475
只有冷血的形式合法
Merely cold legality.

498
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,906
Benson
Benson,

499
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:28,374
Savage夫人应该回到庄园
Mrs. Savage should now return to Somerleigh House.

500
00:34:28,448 --> 00:34:29,521
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

501
00:34:32,626 --> 00:34:35,261
夫人 我向你保证
Ma'am, you have my assurance,

502
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:38,298
我会追着Culverton Smith不放的
I will pursue Culverton Smith.

503
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:40,281
我是不会停止的
I will not rest

504
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:43,418
除非他宣布放弃这个要毁灭你的计划
until he's renounced his plans to ruin you.

505
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,837
福尔摩斯先生呢?
And Mr Holmes?

506
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:47,674
我明白了
I see.

507
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:50,005
我不怪他
I do not blame him.

508
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:54,070
他只不过是和其他人看法一样
He only sees it as the world sees it,

509
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:56,291
看到了不幸
unfortunate and cold hearted

510
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,467
或许还有Smith先生的冷心肠
on Mr. Smith's part perhaps.

511
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:02,766
但却不能给谁加罪
But no case to answer,

512
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:05,908
不能给谁加罪
no case to answer.

513
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:10,600
Smith!
Smith!

514
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:15,449
Smith!
Smith!

515
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:23,807
这仅仅是一个巧合么
It is a singular coincidence, is it not,

516
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,175
你能因一个人的死而继承这么多财产
that you should inherit so much

517
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:31,454
这个人偏偏死于
from a man who dies of a disease

518
00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:35,606
你最有研究的那种疾病
upon which you are the sole expert.

519
00:35:35,678 --> 00:35:37,755
为什么!
Why!

520
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:45,456
仅仅归结为巧合是不能令人信服的
Coincidence, bordering upon the unbelievable.

521
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,865
我来告诉你
Let me tell you

522
00:35:48,942 --> 00:35:53,392
过去向你关闭的
the doors of your profession,

523
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:55,972
专业研究的大门
which had been closed to you,

524
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:58,548
现在将对你永远的锁上
will now be locked

525
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,098
永远的锁上
and bolted against you.

526
00:36:04,818 --> 00:36:07,321
而这就是我的使命
It is my mission.

527
00:36:31,312 --> 00:36:33,088
这里
Yes.

528
00:36:34,828 --> 00:36:37,136
您的信件 福尔摩斯先生
The post, Mr. Holmes.

529
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:51,018
罗得西亚(在非洲)烟草
Rhodesian tobacco,

530
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:53,521
Jeremiah Carlisle寄
Jeremiah Carlisle.

531
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,853
Savage夫人
Mrs. Savage,

532
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,474
我知道您有足够的理智
I know you'll be sensible enough

533
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:11,025
不需要依赖这些东西
not to come to rely on this

534
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:13,848
但这还是有助于您度过这段困难时期
but it will help you through these difficult days.

535
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,813
谢谢您 医生
Thank you doctor.

536
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:26,736
医生 你得赶快来  福尔摩斯先生不行了
Doctor, you must come quickly, it's Mr. Holmes.

537
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,556
-福尔摩斯? -是的
-Mr. Holmes? -Yes.

538
00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:32,060
为什么不早一点来叫我?
Why didn't you call me sooner?

539
00:37:32,135 --> 00:37:34,045
他不让我来
He wouldn't give me leave.

540
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,182
我说不管同不同意 我都要请医生
So I said permission or no, I am.

541
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:40,475
他才说 那就叫华生来吧
And he said well let it be Watson then.

542
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:43,932
我怕他快不行了
I think he's dying.

543
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:45,289
Hudson太太
Now, now, Mrs. Hudson.

544
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:48,462
肯定没有您说的那么糟糕
I'm sure it's not as bad as you fear.

545
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,372
可他不让我靠近他
But he won't let me near him.

546
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:52,775
他一点东西都没有吃
He hasn't eaten a scrap.

547
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,522
他喝了很多水吧?
He has had plenty to drink, right?

548
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,519
三天了 他滴水未进
Not a drop has past his lips these three days

549
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:00,434
他去过Rotherhithe
and he's been to Rotherhithe.

550
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,001
他觉得就是在那传染上了热病
He thinks he caught the fever there.

551
00:38:02,182 --> 00:38:05,652
-天哪 -他要死了 医生
-Good God. -He's dying doctor.

552
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:12,399
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

553
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,420
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

554
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:25,498
华生 我们是陷入困难时期了
Watson, we have fallen upon bad times.

555
00:38:25,577 --> 00:38:26,609
我亲爱的伙伴
My dear fellow...

556
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:28,270
退后 请你往后退!
Stand back, please stand right back!

557
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,114
不然我就把你赶出去
I'll have you thrown out of the house.

558
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:31,216
我想帮助你
I wish to help.

559
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:34,747
要真想帮助我 就照我说的做
The best thing you can do to help is to do what you're told.

560
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:35,715
当然
Of course.

561
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:39,567
关于Culverton Smith 是我们弄错了
We were wrong about Culverton Smith.

562
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:40,960
或许我不喜欢他
Maybe I don't like the man

563
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:42,625
但他不是谋杀犯
but he's no murderer.

564
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:45,484
洪水热在Rotherhithe蔓延
The River Fever is abroad in Rotherhithe.

565
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:47,614
福尔摩斯 我们得立刻送你上医院
Holmes, we must get you to a hospital at once.

566
00:38:47,685 --> 00:38:50,117
不 和我保持距离
No, Now keep your distance!

567
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:51,995
你不知道这病是会传染的么
Don't you see this thing is contagious?

568
00:38:52,072 --> 00:38:54,646
你觉得我会在意这个么?
Do you think such a consideration weighs with me?

569
00:38:54,718 --> 00:38:56,819
离我远点!
Keep your distance!

570
00:38:57,851 --> 00:39:01,090
这病可能会传遍整个伦敦
This could run through London.

571
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,400
是痉挛
It's cramps.

572
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:21,889
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

573
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,755
非要请医生的话
If I had a doctor at least

574
00:39:27,827 --> 00:39:30,854
至少得请个让我信得过的
let me have someone whom I have confidence?

575
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:32,623
你信不过我?
You have none in me?

576
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:33,639
你的友情 当然信得过
Your friendship, yes.

577
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,825
可你只是一名普通的执业医师
But you're only a general practitioner

578
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:38,330
经验不足
with mediocre qualifications.

579
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:40,913
你的这评论可不足取 福尔摩斯
That remark is unworthy of you, Holmes.

580
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:43,436
它清楚地向我表明了 你神经焦躁不安的状态
It shows me very clearly the state of your nerves.

581
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:45,449
它证明了你的无知
That demonstrates your ignorance.

582
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,559
你对塔帕努里(印尼地名)热病 知道多少?
What do you know about Tapanuli Fever?

583
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,927
你知道福摩萨(葡萄牙人对台湾的称呼) 黑色败血症么?
What do you know about Black Formosa corruption?

584
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:51,499
我从来没有听过这两种病
I have never heard of either.

585
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:55,440
这是东方奇怪的病症
That is strange pathological disorders in the east.

586
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:57,657
要是你信不过我 我去请Jasper Meek
If you have no faith in me, let me fetch Jasper Meek.

587
00:39:57,658 --> 00:39:59,529
还有Penrose Fisher 另外Ainstree也在伦敦
Penrose Fisher, Ainstree is here in London.

588
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,776
我去把他找来
Let me fetch him.

589
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:04,394
只有一个人能帮助我
There's only one man who can help me.

590
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:07,582
一个被我们中伤过的人
It's a man we have maligned.

591
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:10,658
Culverton Smith? 你相信他会帮忙么?
Culverton Smith? Do you believe he would help?

592
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,128
他必须帮
He must.

593
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:15,939
这是我唯一的机会了
It is my only chance.

594
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:20,978
牡蛎
Oysters,

595
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,505
它们真的会繁殖 不是么?
they do breed don't they?

596
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,711
我不能想象整个海底
I cannot think that the whole bottom of the ocean

597
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:32,057
就是一团硬硬的牡蛎
is one solid mass of oysters.

598
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:37,733
福尔摩斯 你能听见我说话么?
Holmes, can you hear me?

599
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,687
我马上就出门去找Culverton Smith
I'm going for Culverton Smith this instant.

600
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,723
那你去吧
Then go.

601
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:48,804
我会把他带回来的
I'm to bring him back here with me.

602
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:52,873
他是研究洪水热的专家
He's the emperor of river fevers,

603
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,684
你要说服他来这里
of course you must persuade him

604
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:57,013
但你得找个借口先回来
but you must return alone.

605
00:40:58,278 --> 00:41:02,064
随便什么借口 别跟他一起回来
Any excuse not to come with him.

606
00:41:02,143 --> 00:41:06,137
跟他说我很抱歉 真的很抱歉
Tell him I apologize, I do.

607
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,944
别让我失望 华生
Don't fail me Watson.

608
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:10,934
当然不会的
Of course not.

609
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:17,405
那些河流里
And what of rivers.

610
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:20,958
没有天敌
Are there no natural enemies

611
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:24,047
来限制那些生物的繁殖么?
to limit the increase of these creatures?

612
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:28,477
可怕
It's horrible,

613
00:41:29,508 --> 00:41:31,758
太可怕了
horrible.

614
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:45,413
我要见Culverton Smith 这事很重要
It's essential that I see Mr. Culverton Smith.

615
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:47,018
先生 Culverton Smith先生
Mr. Culverton Smith, sir,

616
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,441
不希望在他工作时
does not appreciate being disturbed

617
00:41:48,516 --> 00:41:49,906
有人打扰
during his hours of study.

618
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:52,057
-等一下 您不能... -Smith!
-Just a minute sir, you can't just... -Smith!

619
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:53,160
先生
Sir!

620
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:54,429
Smith!
Smith!

621
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:55,830
别这样 先生!
Please sir!

622
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:56,952
Smith!
Smith!

623
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:58,783
先生 您不能这样
Sir, you can't just,

624
00:41:58,856 --> 00:42:00,831
您不能进去 先生
you can't just walk in, sir.

625
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:09,255
噢 Smith
Ah, Smith.

626
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:11,744
您这么做是要干什么 先生?
What the devil do you mean by this, sir?

627
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:14,039
我是为了歇洛克 福尔摩斯来的
I've come from Sherlock Holmes.

628
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:16,516
他病的很重
He is desperately ill,

629
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:17,993
他请求您去看看他
and he begs you to come to him.

630
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:19,178
为什么?
Why?

631
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:21,757
您就是个医生 可以照顾他
You are a physician, tend to him yourself.

632
00:42:21,757 --> 00:42:24,936
他相信你是唯一能救他的人
He believes that you are the only man who can save him.

633
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:26,974
救他?
Save him?

634
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,984
我求你来看看吧
I beg you to come.

635
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:31,123
他感染了什么病了?
What has he contracted?

636
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:33,977
他想就是害死你表弟的那种热病
He thinks it is the fever which killed your cousin.

637
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:35,681
他怎么能染上那种病?
How did he come by it?

638
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,315
他去过Rotherhithe
He has been in Rotherhithe.

639
00:42:37,398 --> 00:42:39,759
噢
Ah,

640
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:41,742
真令人遗憾
I'm sorry to hear this.

641
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:44,740
我希望您弄错了
I hope you are wrong.

642
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:47,385
尽管那天他侮辱了我
Despite his insulting behavior the other day,

643
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:49,923
我仍旧尊重他的才智
I have every respect for his talents.

644
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:51,906
他的业余爱好是研究犯罪
He's an amateur of crime

645
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:53,881
就像我的业余爱好是研究疾病
as I am of disease.

646
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:56,413
坏人之于他
For him the villain,

647
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:58,902
仿佛细菌之于我
for me the microbe.

648
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,182
这里是我的囚徒
Here are my prisoners.

649
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,003
在这些培养基的明胶里
Among these gelatin cultivations,

650
00:43:05,075 --> 00:43:08,268
有世界上最凶恶的犯人在服刑
some of the worst offenders in the world are doing time.

651
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:09,939
求你了 已经没有时间可以浪费了
Please, please, there is no time to lose.

652
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,127
他都病得快死了
He is desperately ill.

653
00:43:11,128 --> 00:43:13,650
这跟我有什么相干?
Of what consequence is that to me?

654
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:17,286
他用最无礼的态度对我造谣中伤
He maligned me in the most outrageous manner.

655
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:20,066
他为此感到后悔 他一直在重复这一点
He, he regrets it, he was most  insistent upon that point.

656
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:23,339
他知道热病在Rotherhithe流行
He knows that the fever was abroad in Rotherhithe.

657
00:43:26,227 --> 00:43:27,419
他病了有多久了?
How long has he been ill?

658
00:43:27,496 --> 00:43:28,973
三天了
Three days.

659
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:30,448
他有没有神智昏迷 胡言乱语?
Is he delirious?

660
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,603
有时候很严重
Sometimes seriously so.

661
00:43:32,684 --> 00:43:34,609
我立刻随你一起去
I will come with you at once.

662
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:36,164
我另外还约了点事情 先生
I have another appointment, sir.

663
00:43:36,235 --> 00:43:37,134
那好 我就自己去
Very well, I shall go alone.

664
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:40,565
最多半个小时 我就会到
Staples, you can rely on my being there in a half an hour at most.

665
00:43:43,726 --> 00:43:44,755
你见到他了么?
Did you see him?

666
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:45,844
是的 他正在赶来
Yes, he's coming.

667
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,682
你是最好的信使
Ah, you're the best of messengers.

668
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,263
你可以离开这里了
You can disappear from the scene now.

669
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,866
我应该留下来听听他的意见 福尔摩斯
I should stay to hear his opinion, Holmes,

670
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:52,728
真的很有必要
I really should.

671
00:43:52,728 --> 00:43:54,720
他敏感的近乎病态
No reason he is morbidly sensitive.

672
00:43:54,793 --> 00:43:56,323
我们必须让他独自展现他的技艺
We must let him practice his arts alone.

673
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:58,503
-亲爱的福尔摩斯 -前门有动静
-My dear, Holmes. -That's the front door,

674
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,198
是他
It's him.

675
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:01,088
快藏起来
Hide.

676
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:02,101
藏起来
Hide.

677
00:44:02,102 --> 00:44:03,971
快 如果你爱我的话
Quick, if you love me.

678
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,303
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

679
00:44:52,308 --> 00:44:54,489
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

680
00:44:54,636 --> 00:44:57,125
哦 Smith 我不敢奢望你能来
Oh, Smith, I hardly dared to hope.

681
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,970
我也想不到
I should imagine not.

682
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:01,042
看 我还是来了
Yet you see I'm here.

683
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,670
要以德报怨 福尔摩斯
Coals of fire Holmes,

684
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:04,069
以德报怨 (coals of fire典出圣经 撒下22:13)
coals of fire.

685
00:45:04,145 --> 00:45:05,842
真是高尚
It's noble.

686
00:45:05,921 --> 00:45:07,024
你知道你得了什么病么?
Do you know what is wrong with you?

687
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:07,740
是的
Yes.

688
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,333
你知道这些症状么?
You recognize the symptoms?

689
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:10,682

Yes, quite well.

690
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:11,769
那你是病了三天了?
Three days with you then?

691
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:12,455
是的
Yes.

692
00:45:12,455 --> 00:45:13,604
你坚持的不错
You have lasted well.

693
00:45:13,604 --> 00:45:15,594
到这天Victor就已经死了
With Victor it was all over by now.

694
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:17,294
我注意到了这点
I have noticed this,

695
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:20,710
越是成熟冷静 坚持的越久
the more mature coolies seems to last longer.

696
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:22,606
请给我水 给我水喝
Water please. Could I have some water?

697
00:45:22,607 --> 00:45:24,194
哦 最后的口渴
Oh, the final thirst.

698
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:27,367
你快要完了
You're near the end.

699
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:36,246
请帮帮我 尽你所能帮帮我
Please help me, help me if you can.

700
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:40,970
我可以替你隐瞒你的动机
I could champion your cause.

701
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,042
我的动机?
My cause?

702
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:43,355
你的工作
Your work.

703
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:44,979
它应该广为宣传
It deserves to be trumpeted.

704
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:46,821
我可以为你效劳
I could be of service.

705
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:48,429
我很怀疑
I doubt it.

706
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,429
多亏了你
Thanks to you

707
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:52,760
给我名誉带来了不可弥补的损害
the damage done to my reputation is irreparable.

708
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,902
你是说Victor Savage
You mean Victor Savage,

709
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:56,699
你的表弟
your cousin,

710
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:58,812
我都已经忘了
I had forgotten that.

711
00:45:59,362 --> 00:46:01,651
你也被牵涉进来了么?
Did you, were you involved?

712
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:03,182
我有点不确定了
I couldn't be sure.

713
00:46:08,798 --> 00:46:12,690
大侦探也有不清楚的时候
The great detective couldn't be sure.

714
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:15,348
就算你知道Savage是怎么死的 也没有关系
Well it doesn't matter to me if you know how Savage died.

715
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:17,114
你是不会坐在证人席上了
I don't see you in the witness box,

716
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:19,836
只可能是躺在另外一种盒子里
quite another sort of box.

717
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:27,384
就在他吸鸦片吸得不省人事的时候
I put an infected mosquito to his neck

718
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:30,087
我在他的脖子上放了一只受感染的蚊子
while he was in an opiate stupor.

719
00:46:31,776 --> 00:46:33,583
就是这样
There.

720
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,746
但是你
But you,

721
00:46:37,068 --> 00:46:39,640
你又是怎么被传染的?
how did you come to contract it?

722
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:41,468
你那个来找我的同伴
That fellow who came for me

723
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:44,366
告诉我说你是在Rotherhithe被传染的
told me you thought you caught it in Rotherhithe.

724
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:46,952
我只能这么认为
Oh, I can only account for it, so.

725
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:48,970
好好回想一下
Cast your mind back.

726
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:51,513
-痉挛? -是的
-Cramps? -Oh, yes.

727
00:46:51,514 --> 00:46:53,404
-帮帮我 -我会的
-Help me. -I will.

728
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,685
疼痛
The pain.

729
00:46:55,763 --> 00:46:58,576
死之前总是
Yes, the coolies used to do some squealing

730
00:46:58,653 --> 00:47:00,088
伴随着哀号
before the end.

731
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:02,669
好吧
Well now.

732
00:47:06,174 --> 00:47:08,463
在几天前 你还没有发病的时候
A few days before your symptoms began

733
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:11,388
你是不是收到过什么邮件
did you receive anything by post?

734
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:12,711
我想不起来了
I can't think.

735
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,592
一个包裹?
A parcel?

736
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:15,396
你收到了
You did.

737
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:17,898
是的 一些烟草的样品
Yes, samples of tobacco.

738
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:19,239
没错
That's right.

739
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,246
你没有注意那个盒子的结构么?
Did you notice the construction of the box?

740
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:23,574
在烟草下面
Under the tobacco,

741
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:26,294
有两根小钉子伸了出来
two small tacks stuck out.

742
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:28,314
你没有看到么?
You didn't see them?

743
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,198
是它传染了热病么?
They were infected?

744
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:37,249
你这傻瓜
You fool.

745
00:47:37,752 --> 00:47:40,816
你找我的茬 现在你玩完了
You would tangle with me and now you are finished.

746
00:47:44,158 --> 00:47:45,902
那个盒子
The box.

747
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,306
现在在哪?
Where is it?

748
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:53,599
在哪?
Where is it?

749
00:47:58,605 --> 00:48:00,754
把煤气灯拧亮点
Turn up the gas.

750
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:02,702
把煤气灯拧亮点?
Turn up the gas?

751
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:05,496
影子越来越长了 是么?
The shadows begin to lengthen, do they?

752
00:48:05,569 --> 00:48:07,336
好的 我来拧亮点
Yes, I'll do that.

753
00:48:12,427 --> 00:48:15,169
我更喜欢在亮一点的灯光下看着你死去
I prefer to see you die in the light.

754
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:27,281
在这里
There it is,

755
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,977
你最后的一小点证据
your last shred of evidence.

756
00:48:32,134 --> 00:48:33,447
好了
Well, well,

757
00:48:34,082 --> 00:48:36,781
还有什么可以效劳的么 我的朋友
is there any other little service I can do you my friend?

758
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:41,236
火柴 香烟会很棒
A match and a cigarette would be most welcome.

759
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:58,710
三天不吃不喝是一回事
Three days without food and water is one thing,

760
00:48:59,846 --> 00:49:03,504
但是抽不上烟 就太痛苦了
but to be without tobacco I have found most irksome.

761
00:49:03,606 --> 00:49:05,441
探长 进来吧
Come in Inspector.

762
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:10,713
以拧亮煤气灯为信号
By turning up the gas,

763
00:49:11,023 --> 00:49:15,288
Smith亲自发出了我们的信号
Smith was good enough to give our signal himself.

764
00:49:15,862 --> 00:49:19,291
他坦白谋杀了Victor Savage
This is the self-confessed murderer of Victor Savage.

765
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,975
你可以信口开河 福尔摩斯
You may lie as you like Holmes.

766
00:49:20,975 --> 00:49:24,397
但你证明不了你精神错乱的猜想
You have no corroboration for you insane suspicions.

767
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:28,972
华生 他身后有一个盒子
Watson, he has a box behind his back.

768
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:31,882
小心点拿着
Treat it very gingerly

769
00:49:31,883 --> 00:49:33,482
千万别打开
and don't open it.

770
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:35,219
去死吧
Damn you.

771
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,117
-阻止他 -你去死吧
-Stop him. -Damn you.

772
00:50:01,783 --> 00:50:04,072
扮演一个角色最成功的办法
The best way of acting a part successfully

773
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,191
就是成为这个角色
is to be it.

774
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:06,863
要凡士林做什么?
What's the vaseline for?

775
00:50:06,864 --> 00:50:08,042
涂抹在额头
For the forehead.

776
00:50:09,024 --> 00:50:10,720
眼睛里滴些颠茄酊
Belladonna in the eyes.

777
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,008
蜂蜡
Bee's wax.

778
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,037
抹在嘴唇周围
Incrustation around the lips.

779
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:19,179
为什么你不让我靠近你呢
Why wouldn't you let me near you,

780
