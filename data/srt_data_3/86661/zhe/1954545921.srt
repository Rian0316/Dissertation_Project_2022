亲爱的朋友 发生什么事了?
My dear friend what has happened?

160
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:36,148
您能马上来一趟吗?
Will you come at once?

161
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:38,174
是的 当然可以
Yes of course.

162
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:41,434
垃圾 华生 都是些垃圾
Rubbish Watson rubbish.

163
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:43,494
这些得在它们心脏里插上木棍
What are we to do with walking corpses

164
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:45,366
才能让它们呆在坟墓里的行尸
that have to have stakes driven through their hearts

165
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,517
跟我们有什么关系?
to keep them in their graves?

166
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:51,272
这样的东西真值得我们关注吗?
Are we to give serious attention to such things?

167
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:53,463
完全是精神失常
It's pure lunacy.

168
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:56,139
呃 毫无疑问你是对的
Well no doubt your right.

169
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,748
我们这个事务所
This agency

170
00:15:57,787 --> 00:16:02,364
应该坚守它自己的立场
must stand flat footed upon the ground of that it is to remain.

171
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,767
世界对我们来说够大了
The world is big enough for us.

172
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:06,750
没必要再去管什么鬼的事情
No ghost need apply.

173
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:08,446
噢 对哦 鬼嘛...
Awe well now ghosts...

174
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:10,150
却要我们去管
Need apply.

175
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:17,285
你打不打算告诉我
Are you prepared to tell me

176
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:19,858
这些是谁给你的?
who supplied you with these?

177
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,525
还有给你干嘛?
And to what purpose?

178
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,824
呃 我让Pachum的一个牙医
Well I had them made for me

179
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:27,474
给我做的
by a dentist from Pachum.

180
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:32,369
是我曾经一次需要的必要伪装
It was a necessary disguise I needed once.

181
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:33,725
我忘了
I forget.

182
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:39,291
那你用过它们吗?
And did you put them to use?

183
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,857
颇具打击性的幽默哦 华生
Balking humor again Watson.

184
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,110
你真的要克制这种做法
You really must guard against it.

185
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,946
Albert?
Albert?

186
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:45,718
街上有个人给了我这个 先生
A man gave me this in the street sir.

187
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,826
一位上了年纪的先生
Elderly gent,

188
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,460
他说他有急事要见您
he says he's got to see you urgent.

189
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,343
就是你那位牧师
It's your man of the cloth.

190
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:52,043
让他进来吧
Show him up.

191
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:53,438
小心些
With care.

192
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:54,272
好的 先生
Yes sir.

193
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,355
噢 Albert?
Oh Albert?

194
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:56,494
先生?
Sir?

195
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:59,038
你相信世上有吸血鬼吗?
Do you believe in the existence of vampires?

196
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:02,858
噢 是的 非常相信 先生
Oh yeah, most definitely sir.

197
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:06,159
这是智慧的声音
There speaks the voice of wisdom.

198
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,668
我相信并无实在经历
No experience I trust.

199
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:13,152
好啦 谢谢你 年轻人
Yes thank you young man.

200
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:15,479
我还不算老朽
I'm not quite in my grave yet.

201
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:21,627
你好 福尔摩斯先生
Hello Mr. Holmes,

202
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,518
这么急来找你 你能见我真好

203
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:26,537
我知道你有多忙
I know how busy you are.

204
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,377
请坐下 牧师
Sit down and settle yourself Reverend.

205
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:29,068
谢谢
Thank you.

206
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,091
麻烦你叫Wiggins送些茶进来好吗?
Will you tell Wiggins to bring in the tea?

207
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,567
-好的 先生 -谢谢 Albert
-Yes sir. -Thank you Albert.

208
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:34,387
这位是我的朋友和同事
This is my friend and colleague.

209
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:37,171
华生医生 是的...是的 我认识
Doctor Watson yes...yes I know.

210
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,845
我的顾问
Now my solicitors,

00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,356
Morrison 来自Morrison&...
Morrison, Morrison and...

212
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,088
Dodd公司?
Dodd?

213
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,597
事实上他们并非真是我的顾问
Point of fact there not really my solicitors

214
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:50,831
不是的 很久前我跟他们有些往来
no I had some dealings with them long ago.

215
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:54,492
我不太记得是关于什么事的了
I forget quite what about.

216
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,949
机械
Machinery.

217
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:57,479
是吗?
Was it?

218
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:58,804
呃 不管怎么说
Well anyway

219
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:05,954
我是代表我的朋友和我本人到这儿来的
I'm here on behalf of a friend of mine and myself too.

220
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:08,428
我非常希望你们不要
And I'm very anxious you shouldn't take me

221
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,484
把我当成一个老傻瓜
for a complete old fool.

222
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:11,584
不会的
Please.

223
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:17,182
你慢慢说
You must take your time.

224
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,737
从何说起呢
Where to start it all.

225
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,833
我是Lamberley教区的牧师
I'm Vicar of Lamberley;

226
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:26,263
我在那地方呆了很久了
I've been there longer than I care to think.

227
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,625
是该走人的时候了
Only time to go but

228
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:30,752
不过让我跟你谈谈Bob Ferguson
Iet me tell you about Bob Ferguson.

229
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:34,604
不会是Richmond的Bob Ferguson吧?
Not Bob Ferguson of Richmond?

230
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:36,341
他也记得你 医生
He remembers you too Doctor

231
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,842
你们在橄榄球场上结识
from the rugby field.

232
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,467
他也许是最好的三分卫
Possibly the finest three-quarter

233
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,101
不过不曾为英格兰出赛过
never to have been capped for England.

234
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:45,071
我就是这样看的
And my sentiments precisely.

235
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,496
我热爱这项运动
I love the game and

236
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:53,550
毫不谦虚地说 我曾经打得不错
if modesty permits I once turned out myself quite a player.

237
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,010
Bob在国外工作了很多年
Well Bob has spent much most of his working life abroad.

238
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:00,544
做棉花贸易
Cotton brooking.

239
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:03,734
他跟他前妻生了一个孩子叫Jack
Now his first wife, by whom he has a son Jack,

240
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:08,960
几年前他妻子死于高烧...
she died of fever some years ago and...

241
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,532
瞧 我觉得很有必要让你
Iook it's absolutely essential

242
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:16,191
了解事情的全貌
that I put you in the full picture.

243
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:18,169
就这样接着讲下去吧 牧师
Continue just as you're doing Reverend.

244
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:19,830
福尔摩斯经常是
It is often Holmes' method

245
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:20,936
紧闭着双眼
to absorb all

246
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:25,399
把所有的细节都听进去
relevant detail with his eyes tight shut.

247
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:32,563
Bob最近回到了家乡
Well Bob arrived home recently

248
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:37,152
带了一位从秘鲁来的新娘 和他们襁褓中的孩子
with a new bride and a baby from Peru.

249
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:39,341
对于所有有关的人来说 都是一场艰难的改变
Difficult transition for all concerned

250
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,038
这个你想象得到
as you may imagine.

251
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:56,831
你会骑马吗 Jack?
You ride Jack?

252
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,471
-不会 -他当然会了
-No. -Of course he rides.

253
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:00,196
还是我教的呢
I taught him.

254
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,324
所有的事情都是我教给你的 对吧Jack?
Taught you everything didn't I Jack?

255
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:05,099
不过我得让你注意一位陌生人
But I must turn your attention to a stranger

256
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:09,902
就在这一家从秘鲁回来前 他先来到了我们这里
who came into our midst not long before our Peruvian family.

257
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,475
他叫John Stockton
His name is John Stockton.

258
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,040
呃 起初我很欢迎他
Well at first I welcomed him

259
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,357
把他当作是一个知识分子 一个作家
as a man of intellect,a writer

260
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,935
一个能给我们小小的社区带来生机的人
and stimulus to our little community.

261
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:20,435
噢 谢谢
Oh thank you.

262
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,317
不能说我个人对他有什么好感
I can't say that I warmed to him personally

263
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,821
不过对于我这样一个
but he did have his own appeal

264
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,282
窝在穷乡僻壤的人
to someone like myself,

265
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,227
他的确有着吸引力
buried in the backwater.

266
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:38,375
他对我虽然不具什么威胁 却让当地人颇为不安
He was not threat to me but he upset the locals.

267
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,557
我们的铁匠Carter
our blacksmith, Carter.

268
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,210
和他就一个车轮起了争执
Some argument over a wheel.

269
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:45,983
你以为你是谁 敢跑来告诉我该怎么做? 你这该死的!
Who are you come telling me my job damn you?

270
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,205
你要是不喜欢它 就把它带走
If you don't like it you can take it away.

271
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:49,838
另请高明!
Find somebody else!

272
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:52,907
你跟它一起滚 别再回来了!
And take yourself with it and don't come back.

273
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,710
我们这个村子不欢迎你!
We don't want you here in this village.

274
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,030
这里没人欢迎你!
None of us!

275
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:17,246
Carter正值壮年 彪悍得像头狮子
Carter, a lion of a man in the prime of life

276
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,461
乡村生活造就了他强壮的体格
Stalwart of village life,

277
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,701
结果当下就死了
dead within moments of it.

278
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,325
我教区有一个老小姐叫Ruddock
Now Miss Ruddock, spinster of my parish,

279
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:30,727
她的农舍正对着Stockton的屋子
she has the cottage facing Stockton's.

280
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:34,764
她说他是一个不用睡觉的人
And she speaks of him as the man who never sleeps.

281
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:39,036
她很多个晚上都看到 他屋里彻夜点着蜡烛直到天亮
She sees a candle in his window many a nights through till dawn.

282
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:43,238
呃 作家在晚上写作 也不算稀奇
Well writers work it's not uncommon.

283
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:44,010
有可能
Possibly

284
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:48,491
不过我自己因为失眠
but I myself am something of an insomniac also

285
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:54,199
也曾有两次 深夜在墓地里见过他
I have seen him twice in my graveyard at dead of night.

286
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,109
他是怎么解释的?
And his explanation?

287
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:57,083
啊?
Huh?

288
00:21:57,157 --> 00:21:58,957
你肯定提起过这件事吧?
Surely you raised the matter?

289
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,014
解释吗?
Explanation?

290
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:06,615
看似可信吧 我想
Plausible I suppose.

291
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:13,153
我想我跟一家叫Sinclair的有些亲戚关系
I believe that I'm related to a family called Sinclair,

292
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,570
它正是我的中间名
indeed my middle name.

293
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:17,145
Sinclair?
Sinclair?

294
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:20,584
他们在村子的那一头有一栋大房子
They had a large house up beyond the village.

295
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,546
是的 你这么说我想起来了
Yes now you mention it.

296
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:28,162
我很奇怪在这里找不到任何他们的踪迹
I'm puzzled to find no trace of them.

297
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,687
难道我们在这里不受欢迎吗?
Are we not welcome here?

298
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:33,859
其实不是的
No the truth was

299
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:37,577
事实是我很清楚Sinclair一家的故事
that I knew full well the story of the Sinclair's.

300
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:39,495
他们是很有权势的地主
They were powerful landowners,

301
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:41,063
整个村子都是他们的
had the village in their pocket

302
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:44,193
大概是上个世纪的事情了
sometime in the last century.

303
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:47,903
Sinclair本人是个残忍的怪物
The Lord Sinclair himself was a cruel monster.

304
00:22:47,985 --> 00:22:52,323
那些招惹他的人不是失踪了
Those who incurred his displeasure disappeared

305
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,066
就是被人割断了喉咙
or were found with their throats cut.

306
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:58,441
年轻的女仆中有一个
Young servant girls, one in particular,

307
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,549
怀着孩子被遗弃在教堂门口 奄奄一息
was left pregnant and dying at the church door,

308
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:05,170
她的孩子生下来就死了
her child stillborn.

309
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,354
一个姓Sinclair的都找不到
There's not a Sinclair to be found.

310
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,839
我们做了什么让人如此憎恨的事情?
What did we do to offend?

311
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,341
你有没有告诉他?
Did you tell him?

312
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:18,080
呃 说了个大概
Well the bare bones of it yes.

313
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:19,368
那起教堂事件
The church incident

314
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,771
还有村民们如何实施了
and how the villagers exacted

315
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,988
可怕的复仇
their terrible revenge.

316
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,362
把我们的人都烧死了?
Burnt us out?

317
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:29,279
很抱歉这么说
I regret to say,

318
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:31,890
当然不是针对你本人的
nothing personal to you of course.

319
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:33,621
那个女孩呢?
And the girl?

320
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:35,774
就埋在那边
She's buried over there.

321
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,555
但是我没有告诉他一件事情
But what I neglected to tell him

322
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:45,932
因为说了不太合适
because it seemed to be inappropriate

323
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,808
那就是Sinclair家
was that the family Sinclair

324
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:52,567
被认为是吸血鬼
were deemed to be vampires.

325
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:54,449
你说的事情都很有意思 牧师
All of this is very interesting Reverend.

326
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:55,264
不过这都是过去的事了
as piece of history

327
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:57,504
跟现在又怎么扯上关系了?
but how does it lead to the present?

328
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,729
呃 Sinclair自己都承认了
Well then Sinclair by his own admission

329
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:01,647
他回来了 不是吗?
has returned hasn't he?

330
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:03,488
可对村子又有什么影响呢?
But how does that affect the village?

331
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:05,543
村里人干嘛要在乎呢?
And why should they care?

332
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:07,831
所有的这些都发生在一百年前啊
All of this happened a hundred years back.

333
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,548
是的 不过你知道的...有些传言...
Yes well...word gets around you know?

334
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:13,396
你是说教堂吗?
You mean the church?

335
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:15,487
深受流言的影响
Profound to all gossip.

336
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,989
回答你的第二个问题吧
Answering your second question

337
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:21,569
那个女孩 那个死去的女孩
the girl, the dead girl,

338
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:24,973
她的后人还生活在这个村子里
her family is still in the village.

339
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:28,002
比如当地旅馆的老板娘
The wife of the landlord of the local inn for instance

340
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:30,468
她就是姓Barrows的
she was a Barrows.

341
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:33,115
还有铁匠的妻子
So too was the blacksmith's wife.

342
00:24:37,426 --> 00:24:39,215
据你所知
Has Stockton, to your knowledge,

343
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:41,312
Stockton是否进过教堂?
ever set foot inside the church?

344
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,071
噢 一次也没有  据我所知 从来都没有
Oh no not once as far as I'm aware of it...never.

345
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,201
既便如此
Even so,

346
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:50,323
我还是不清楚我能帮你什么忙
I'm unclear that I can be of service to you.

347
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:52,124
又没有犯下什么罪行
No crime has been committed.

348
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:54,144
没有罪行?
No crime?

349
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,292
是的...没有任何犯罪? 但是...
No...no crime? But...

350
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:04,952
你还有什么要告诉我们的吗?
You have something more to tell us?

351
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:09,061
四天前...现在看来像是过了一辈子
4 days ago now, it seems a lifetime;

352
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,562
Bob Ferguson邀请Stockton去吃饭
Bob Ferguson invited Stockton to dinner.

353
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,959
你知道Stockton在秘鲁旅行过
You see, Stockton had traveled in Peru

354
00:25:14,035 --> 00:25:17,057
我想是我对他提过
and I think it was I who suggested

355
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,380
说让他的新太太重新
that it might be a good thing for his new wife

356
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:24,566
跟自己的故乡建立些联系是件好事
to have some contact again with her native country.

357
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:27,031
难道那并非是个
And the evening

358
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:29,155
成功的夜晚?
not a success?

359
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,720
我所知道的就是
All I know is

360
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:35,271
那个晚上结果演变成一场悲剧
that the outcome of it was a tragedy.

361
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:36,838
就在第二天早上
The very next morning

362
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:41,214
那家人醒来发现了一件可怕的事情
the household woke to a terrible discovery.

363
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:45,937
那个婴孩 Ricardo 死在他的小床上
The baby, little Ricardo, lay dead in his cot.

364
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,926
医生的结论呢?
And the doctor's verdict.

365
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:52,375
医生找不到任何致死的原因
The doctor he could find no reason for it.

366
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:59,089
没有可能的原因
No earthly reason.

367
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,111
真是一场悲剧
Tragedy indeed.

368
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,720
但是晚宴的客人的确没有什么好指责的吧?
But no blame affixed to the dinner guest surely?

369
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:06,937
可是他碰了婴孩的手
But he touched the baby's hand.

370
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,230
他们就是这么告诉我的
So they told me.

371
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:15,004
瞧 我是个牧师 先生们
Look I'm a man of God gentlemen

372
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,112
我绝对不会
and far be it for me

373
00:26:16,196 --> 00:26:18,340
单凭谣言或是迷信
to judge a fellow being

374
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:20,992
就对一个人下结论
on hearsay and superstition

375
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,313
可是我也要考虑我的教民们
but I also have my parishioners to think of

376
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:24,848
他们都吓得要命
and their frightened

377
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:27,245
他们将会采取非法律途径
and they will take steps outside the law

378
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,776
来把他赶出去
to drive him out

379
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,307
就像以前对待他的祖先那样
as they once did his forbearers.

380
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,117
你明白我的两难境地了吧?
You see my dilemma?

381
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:35,933
那么你希望我们进行调查?
So you wish us to make an investigation

382
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:41,499
调查这个人以及他的为人和生活习惯?
into this man, his personality, his habits?

383
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:44,454
以证实大众的担心是毫无理由的?
And disprove the common fear?

384
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:47,195
证明或是驳斥 随便你们
Disprove, disprove what you will.

385
00:26:47,277 --> 00:26:48,663
只要你一出现
You're presence alone

386
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:50,430
就能起到安定民心的效果
will have a steadying affect.

387
00:26:57,394 --> 00:27:00,831
我现在得走了
Well now I must leave you.

388
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:02,456
我还得操心的是
Among my other concerns

389
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,065
村里的疾病
is sickness in the village

390
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:06,045
而且我还得为明天婴儿的葬礼
and I have the baby's funeral

391
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,062
做好准备
to prepare for tomorrow.

392
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:12,200
你的故事真复杂 牧师
Your story is complex Reverend.

393
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:16,373
不过却是很有意思
But none of that's uninterest.

394
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:20,047
我相信应该有合理的解释
Yet I'm sure there's a rational explanation for it.

395
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,908
华生和我将会到您的教区去
Watson and I will visit your community.

396
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:30,131
噢 我太高兴了
Oh I'm so pleased.

397
00:27:30,212 --> 00:27:31,704
您提到了一个旅馆
You mentioned an inn.

398
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:34,655
是的 叫Checquers 是个像样的地方
Yes the Checquers, it's a decently run place.

399
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,874
呃 谢谢
Well thank you.

400
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:38,342
我非常地感激
I'm so grateful.

401
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,668
感激你们二位
So grateful to you both.

402
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,760
非常感激
So grateful.

403
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,751
好的 两起突然的死亡事件
All right, 2 sudden deaths,

404
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,374
铁匠和婴儿
the blacksmith and the child,

405
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,699
就在和他接触后不久
shortly after contact.

406
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:20,841
自然死亡
Natural causes,

407
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:23,625
验尸官的报告会这么说
as the coroner's report will inform us.

408
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:25,397
Stockton夜里的习惯
Stockton's nocturnal habits

409
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,728
还有窗后的烛光?
the light in the window?

410
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,062
写作不顺罢了
Writer's block.

411
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,843
他对天黑以后的墓地怀有的病态兴趣?
His morbid interest in graveyards after dark?

412
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:36,207
对"病态"这个词我不敢苟同
I object the word morbid.

413
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:38,678
这是一种动机但并非事实
It's a motive not fact.

414
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:40,516
好吧 那从不进教堂又怎么说?
All right, never entering the church?

415
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:42,050
这可是你自己提出来的
You raised that point yourself.

416
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:43,616
是似乎从未进过教堂
Never seemed to enter the church

417
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,072
是不是因为他没有宗教信仰
and does that make a man a ghoul

418
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:47,125
就可以断定他为盗尸贼?
because he has no interest in religion?

419
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:49,211
那在Ferguson房子里做客的夜晚呢?
The evening spent in Ferguson's house?

420
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:50,905
牧师是否在现场?
Was the Vicar there?

421
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:52,511
没有 不过Merridew告诉过我们
No but Merridew tells us

422
00:28:52,586 --> 00:28:54,598
Stockton碰了那婴孩的手
that Stockton touched the baby's hand.

423
00:28:54,672 --> 00:28:56,364
那是你的案子吗?
Is that your case?

424
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,791
那我们到这儿干嘛来了?
So what is our mission here?

425
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,253
也许是来阻止一次犯罪
Possibly to prevent a crime.

426
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:01,992
这个人的心脏就要被插上木棍了
A man having a stake driven through his heart.

427
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:16,244
我们的时机正合适
We have our timing right.

428
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:43,768
福尔摩斯 我们不能强行闯进去
Holmes we can scarcely intrude.

429
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:48,633
不是闯进去 华生 是观察
Not intrude Watson, observe.

430
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:21,236
我想知道Stockton是不是在这里
I wonder if Stockton's here

431
00:30:21,312 --> 00:30:23,596
这种场合他不可能会露面的
He's hardly likely to show is face on this occasion.

432
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:26,412
他是最近晚宴的客人 还是这家人的朋友
A recent dinner guest, a friend of the family.

433
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,847
在这种情形下 不会的
In the circumstances no.

434
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:31,945
我想你是对的
Yes I'm sure you're right.

435
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:34,716
但是我知道他就在不远处
But I know he's not far away.

436
00:30:34,797 --> 00:30:37,010
一位女士的儿子
Man that is born of woman

437
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:39,660
只活了短短的一生
hath but a short time to live

438
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:42,823
充满了痛苦
and is full of misery.

439
00:30:42,894 --> 00:30:47,407
他像彗星般掠过 又如花朵般夭折
He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.

440
00:30:47,483 --> 00:30:50,076
他像个影子般匆匆而过
He fleeth as it were a shadow.

441
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:54,316
就再也没有留下
A never continueth in one's stay.

442
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,763
在生命的旅途中 我们陷入死亡
In the midst of life we are in death.

443
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,317
除了您 我们还可以向谁求助呢 我们的主啊
Of whom may we seek for succor but of thee O' Lord

444
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:06,904
您应该为我们的罪过而恼怒
who for our sins are justly displeased

445
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:09,820
我们谦恭地恳求您 主啊
we meekly beseech the O' Father

446
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,468
把我们从罪的死亡中解救出来
to raise us from the death of sin

447
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:15,241
升入正义的九天
unto the life of righteousness.

448
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:17,783
祈求当我们死去
That when we shall depart this life

449
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:20,107
我们能在他的怀抱里安息
we may rest in him,

450
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:26,014
希望我们的这位教友亦是如此
as our hope is this our brother does.

451
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,908
在最后审判日的复活中
That the general resurrection in the last day

452
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:33,243
我们能为您所接受
we may be found acceptable in thy sight

453
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:35,572
得到您的祝福...
and receive that blessing which thy...

454
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,025
Jack在八九岁的时候从一棵树上摔了下来
Jack fell from a tree when he was eight or nine.

455
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,535
伤了脊椎骨 可怜的Jack
Damaged his spine boy oh Jack.

456
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:37,269
当时
But father,

457
00:32:37,273 --> 00:32:39,659
那位父亲是在这里还是在国外?
was he here or abroad when it happened?

458
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:42,829
呃 我想他当时不在这儿
Well I do believe he was away yes.

459
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,991
几乎没有父母亲的童年
A boyhood almost without it's mother or father.

460
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:49,178
呃 在这儿我是他的精神导师
Well I was here as his spiritual guardian

461
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,713
还有Mason太太
and Mrs. Mason,

462
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:52,338
农场来的女管家
the housekeeper from the farm,

463
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:55,679
她把他和她自己的孩子Michael一起养大
she brought him up with her own boy Michael.

464
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:58,328
这些死亡记录 福尔摩斯 好多人啊
These recorded deaths Holmes so many of them,

465
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,749
都这么年轻
so young.

466
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:01,696
也许是流感盛行
An influenza epidemic perhaps.

467
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,144
就像现在一样
As we have now upon us.

468
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:10,002
如果Stockton是一个复仇者的话
If Stockton is perceived as some sort of avenger

469
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,783
他干嘛要选中Ferguson一家?
why should he light upon the Ferguson's?

470
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:14,871
他们的家族一百年前并不在这里啊
I mean they weren't here a hundred years ago.

471
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:17,982
即使是现在他们也没有 融入这里的乡村生活
Even now they're scarcely apart of the village life.

472
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,663
为什么呢?
So why?

473
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,717
他们怎么会勾起他的兴趣的?
Why is he drawn to them?

474
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,011
这个女士 还有跟秘鲁的联系?
The women, the connection with Peru?

475
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:30,435
还是因为就近选择?
Or is it something nearer home?

476
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:59,069
你跟本地的医生交上朋友了吗?
Did you make friends with the local doctor?

477
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,736
不是什么朋友
Hardly friends

478
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:03,446
他对我颇为猜疑
as I was greeted with deep suspicion.

479
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,435
我不得不用我30年前
Had to plead my rugby acquaintanceship

480
00:34:05,512 --> 00:34:08,697
跟Ferguson的橄榄球缘作为借口
with Ferguson that goes back 30 years.

481
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:10,558
他在老Deer公园球场
He threw me over the ropes into the crowd

482
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:13,838
把我扔过了绳栏 扔到了人群中
at the Old Deer Park.

483
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,312
你怎么解释你的出现?
How do you explain your presence here?

484
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:21,102
呃 我觉得我们不会在这里呆很久的
Well I cant believe that we'll be detained here long.

485
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,849
另一份验尸报告
Another coroner's report.

486
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:28,052
铁匠Carter死于出血
Blacksmith, Carter, died of a hemorrhage.

487
00:34:28,136 --> 00:34:30,005
也许他看上去是健壮如牛
He may have look robust but he was overweight

488
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,152
不过他体重超标又喝很多酒
and he drank too much.

489
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:32,337
那婴儿呢?
And the baby?

490
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:34,100
记录为肺炎
Put down to pneumonia.

491
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,151
没有暴力的迹象?
No sign of violence?

492
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:36,431
没有
No.

493
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:38,096
跟我们想的一样
Just as we thought.

494
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:39,375
现在去拜访Ferguson如何?
What now a visit to Ferguson?

495
00:34:39,415 --> 00:34:40,836
以示尊敬?
Pay our respects?

496
00:34:41,236 --> 00:34:42,383
不去
No.

497
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:46,580
我饿了
I'm hungry.

498
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:54,299
Jack
Jack.

499
00:35:17,798 --> 00:35:18,897
Jack在哪儿?
Where's Jack?

500
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:20,151
他是在下面跟你在一起吗?
Is he down with you?

501
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:21,401
没有
No.

502
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:24,775
从下午到现在 我没有看见过他也没有听到他的声音
I haven't seen sight nor sound of him since this afternoon.

503
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:27,481
葬礼之后他没有回来过吗?
He didn't come back here after the funeral?

504
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:29,612
我问问Michael看他是否见到过他
I'll ask Michael if he's seen him.

505
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:30,925
好的
Yes.

506
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:32,495
这是给Ferguson太太的吗?
Is that for Mrs. Ferguson?

507
00:35:32,569 --> 00:35:33,953
是的 鸡汤
Yes, chicken broth.

508
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:35,234
她得吃点东西才行
She must eat something.

509
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:36,809
我拿上去吧
I'll take it up to her.

510
00:35:37,955 --> 00:35:39,409
谢谢 管家太太
Thank you my lady.

511
00:35:53,214 --> 00:35:55,119
不要吃的
No food.

512
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:59,530
她睡着了 先生 别吵醒她
She's sleep now sir, no wake her up.

513
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:01,749
这个我来做主 Dolores
I'll decide that Dolores.

514
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:02,931
谢谢
Thank you.

515
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,901
别碰我
Don't touch me.

516
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,007
走开!
Go away!

517
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:43,689
还要我拿点别的吗 先生们?
Anything more I can get you gentlemen?

518
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:44,900
这个太棒了
This is excellent.

519
00:37:44,982 --> 00:37:46,187
不要了 谢谢
No thank you.

520
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:48,696
一杯水 谢谢
Glass of water thank you.

521
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,117
他们都看见你了 Michael
You were seen Michael.

522
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:53,451
他们就是看见你了 不承认也没用
Yes you were and there's no denying it.

523
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,743
整个仪式中都抓着你的胳膊
Clutching your arm right through that service.

524
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:57,314
不是我干的 Vera
It wasn't my doing Vera.

525
00:37:57,389 --> 00:37:58,701
她很沉痛
She was grieving.

526
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:00,957
需要一个男人的支撑
She needed the support of a man.

527
00:38:01,037 --> 00:38:04,436
就因为她是外国来的还很漂亮吗?
Just cause she's foreign and beautiful?

528
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,040
不像你一样会骑马
Not ride a horse like you.

529
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:09,510
噢 骑马又怎么啦?
Oh what's it matter riding horses?

530
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,173
我肯定你亲了她了 我了解你
I bet you kissed her knowing you.

531
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:12,318
亲她?
Kissed her?

532
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:14,307
要是那样的话我的下巴都会被打碎的
I'd get my jaw broken with that one.

533
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:15,553
她脾气暴躁
She's fiery.

534
00:38:15,635 --> 00:38:16,947
你不就喜欢那样的吗
It's just how you like it.

535
00:38:17,024 --> 00:38:18,478
没错
That's right.

536
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:21,396
就像你一样全身羽毛都竖起来了
All ruffled feathers my dear.

537
00:38:21,474 --> 00:38:24,049
-来吧 我们到外面去 -不要! 走开!
-Come on let's step outside.. -No get off.

538
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:26,646
-噢 来吧 -不 Michael!
-Oh come one. -No Michael!

539
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,005
我今晚不舒服
I'm not feeling very well tonight.

540
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,687
谢谢
Thank you.

541
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,248
这牛排和腰子布丁
This steak and kidney pudding

542
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,015
果然名副其实
is every bit as good as it's reputation

543
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,106
你不觉得吗 华生?
wouldn't you say Watson?

544
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:51,801
是的 名副其实
Yes every bit.

545
00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:55,733
你在贝克街可是出了名啊 Gresty太太
You're famous in Beggar Street Mrs. Gresty.

546
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,264
我们的管家 Hudson太太
Our housekeeper Mrs. Hudson

547
00:38:57,339 --> 00:38:58,995
向我们推荐了你
put us onto you.

548
00:38:59,077 --> 00:39:00,911
Hudson太太?
Mrs. Hudson?

549
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:03,095
她有个妹妹住在这儿附近
She has a sister who lives near by.

550
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,977
噢
Oh.

551
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:07,647
呃 你要夸就夸我先生
Well it's my husband you have to compliment.

552
00:39:07,731 --> 00:39:10,264
东西主要都是他煮的
It's him who does the cooking mostly.

553
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:12,408
那么你就是歇洛克 福尔摩斯?
So you are Sherlock Holmes?

554
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:14,255
听候您差遣
At your service.

555
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:15,824
你们来这儿办案的吗?
On a case there are ya?

556
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:18,599
噢 这里肯定...
Oh surely there is no crime

557
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:21,555
没有什么罪案的啦
in this part of the country.

558
00:39:29,312 --> 00:39:31,075
请我们的男主人喝上一杯 华生
Drinks for our host Watson,

559
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:32,503
也请大伙儿喝一杯
drinks all around.

560
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:38,479
当然好了
Yes of course.

561
00:39:38,558 --> 00:39:39,657
噢 华生医生
Oh Doctor Watson

562
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,376
他是Ferguson先生以前的一位橄榄球友
is an old rugby-playing friend of Mr. Ferguson.

563
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:48,008
对他和他的家人来说这事儿真够惨的
It's a tragedy about him and his family.

564
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,708
你想跟Michael谈谈吗?
You want to talk to Michael about that.

565
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:53,289
他们发现那可怜的孩子时他就在那儿
He was there when they found the poor mate.

566
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:57,320
那也不是什么意外死亡
And it wasn't no accidental death neither.

567
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,822
别的什么都有可能
Whatever else it was

568
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:02,701
唯独不是一起意外
it wasn't no accident.

569
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:21,157
Jack你去哪儿了?
Jack where've you been?

570
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:23,558
我很担心
I was worried.

571
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:26,926
我以为你想跟Carlotta独处一下
I thought you'd want to be alone with Carlotta.

572
00:40:27,005 --> 00:40:29,112
我需要你
I needed you.

573
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:34,821
此刻我需要我们像一家人那样团结在一起
I needed us together as a family this time.

574
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:36,443
我们所有人在一起
All of us together.

575
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,534
您是对的 牧师
You are right Reverend.

576
00:41:34,614 --> 00:41:37,419
空气中弥漫着一种危险的气氛
There is a dangerous mood in the air.

577
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:41,525
但是并没有任何对Stockton不利的证据
But no fresh evidence against Stockton.

578
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:44,260
这种巧合还是让我无法平静
I'm still struck by the coincidence.

579
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,536
呃 回答我的这个问题 福尔摩斯
Well answer me this Holmes.

580
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:50,758
要是真没什么的话
Why is so much being written and recorded

581
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,603
为什么还有那么多记载
on the subject of vampires

582
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:54,337
是关于吸血鬼的?
if there's absolutely nothing in it?

583
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,490
这是人类的需要 华生
Man's need Watson.

584
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,751
出于对恐惧的解释的需要
His need to explain fear.

585
00:41:58,831 --> 00:42:00,937
那么你承认有些事情是无法解释的了?
Then you do admit to the inexplicable?

586
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:03,589
是的 有非常多的证据表明这点
Well yes there's plenty evidence of that.

587
00:42:03,663 --> 00:42:05,496
但是你是否会因为有很多人写过
But do you believe in dragons

588
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:07,618
就相信有龙的存在
and fairies and ghosts

589
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:09,905
还相信仙女和鬼?
because much has been written about them?

590
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,197
鬼?
Ghosts?

591
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,740
华生有个鬼故事要讲
Watson has a ghost story.

592
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:16,305
不是说这个的时候 老兄
Not now man.

593
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:18,698
不 说吧  华生
No carry on Watson.

594
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:20,468
当时我在阿富汗
I was in Afghanistan.

595
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:22,346
经历了许多疲劳的长夜
Long nights of fatigue.

596
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:24,992
在一个战地医院里
In a field hospital.

597
00:42:25,065 --> 00:42:26,613
有一个年轻中尉死了
A young subaltern,

598
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:28,911
事实上他就死在我的怀里
who had died, virtually in my arms,

599
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,973
在他过世的几周后 我在伊斯坦布尔休假
appeared some weeks later quite unmistakably

600
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,618
他分明就出现在了那儿
when I was on leave in Constantinople.

601
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:36,237
真有意思
Fascinating.

602
00:43:01,132 --> 00:43:02,372
先生们
Gentleman.

603
00:43:02,453 --> 00:43:03,622

605
00:43:05,057 --> 00:43:06,404
还有华生医生 我想你认识他
And Dr. Watson I believe you know.

606
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,803
华生 亲爱的朋友
Watson, my dear fellow.

607
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,642
请进 请进

610
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:20,129
都准备好了 先生
It's ready and waiting sir.

611
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:23,776
我的难得的好管家
My treasured housekeeper.

612
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:25,439
要是没有她我们都不知道怎么办
We'd be lost without her.

613
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:30,660
噢 请坐
Oh sit down please.

614
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:32,877
Augustus向我解释了你们来这儿的原因
Augustus has explained your presence here

615
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,536

00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,226
这是个悲惨的时刻
This has been wretched time

617
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:40,488
不只是对我和我的家人
not just for me and my family

618
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:43,588
对于整个社区而言也一样
but for the whole community.

619
00:43:43,661 --> 00:43:46,229
我们越快弄明白越好
The sooner we make sense of it the better.

620
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:48,442
你的爱妻呢?
Your dear wife?

621
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:51,437
是的 我本来很想要她也到场的

622
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:53,272
她在楼上自己的房间里
She's upstairs in her room.

623
00:43:55,753 --> 00:43:57,480
你见过Stockton了吗?
Have you met Stockton yet?

624
00:43:57,558 --> 00:44:00,150
还未有幸会面 Ferguson先生
We've not had that pleasure Mr. Ferguson.

625
00:44:00,235 --> 00:44:02,483
有幸?
Pleasure?

626
00:44:02,564 --> 00:44:04,610
噢 是的 我第一次认识他的时候
Oh yes he seemed he was pleasant enough

627
00:44:04,682 --> 00:44:06,752
他似乎是个令人愉快的人
on my first acquaintance.

628
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:09,014
我可以问你问题吗?
May I ask you?

629
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:10,823
您随便问 福尔摩斯先生
Ask anything Mr. Holmes.

630
00:44:10,902 --> 00:44:12,177
问什么都行
Anything.

631
00:44:15,003 --> 00:44:18,022
在某种程度上我们是不是把你孩子的死
Are we some way holding Stockton responsible

632
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:21,598
归咎于Stockton了?
for your child's death?

633
00:44:21,673 --> 00:44:25,450
也许在某种程度上我们都要负上些责任
Perhaps were all responsible to some degree.

634
00:44:25,531 --> 00:44:27,992
当然我妻子责怪我
Certainly my wife holds me responsible

635
00:44:30,464 --> 00:44:33,127
把她带到英国来
for bringing her here to England.

636
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:39,589
小孩还不满一岁 还有气候 欧洲
The child not a year old, the climate, Europe,

637
00:44:39,671 --> 00:44:42,405
也许我盼着能通过归咎于他人
perhaps I'm looking to alleviate responsibility.

638
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:44,947
来减轻些自己的责任
By directing it at another.

639
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:50,053
请你原谅我的坦率
Please you must excuse my frankness.

640
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,844
但如果想要弄清问题的实质 我们则很有必要
But it is necessary that we confront the truth about ourselves

641
00:44:53,918 --> 00:44:56,581
面对我们真实的内心
if we are to reach the heart of this matter.

642
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:59,363
你一点也没错 福尔摩斯先生
Your absolutely right Mr. Holmes.

643
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:01,487
事实的真相
The truth of the matter.

644
00:45:01,562 --> 00:45:03,253
你能不能跟我们说说
Could you bring yourself to tell us about

645
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:06,066
Stockton来用餐的那个晚上?
the evening Stockton came over to dinner?

646
00:45:06,148 --> 00:45:07,423
我想那晚你开始
Which I understand

647
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,203
对他充满疑虑
was the start of your misgivings about him.

648
00:45:10,282 --> 00:45:11,973
好的
Yes.

649
00:45:12,055 --> 00:45:15,588
那天晚上... 那时我自己也不是很明白
That night I didn't see it clearly myself at the time.

650
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:19,171
晚餐平安无事
Dinner had passed uneventfully

651
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:20,487
虽然我得承认
though I confess

652
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:23,824
我对我的客人有些失望
I was somewhat disappointed by our guest.

653
00:45:23,903 --> 00:45:25,914
他的行为
His demeanor.

654
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,972
灵魂的本性...
The real nature of the soul.

655
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:35,148
到底是什么呢
Well what is it

656
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:39,601
对于某些人而言它只不过是意愿的体现
to some merely a manifestation of the will.

657
00:45:39,678 --> 00:45:42,798
但是灵魂会回归造物主
But the soul returns to God.

658
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,938
就像一个声音在空气中消失无踪
Like a sound that vanishes in the air.

659
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:50,479
所以在某种程度上
So for degrees.

660
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:54,507
哲人说生即是死
Life is death say the philosopher's.

661
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:56,904
我不是很明白
But I'm afraid I don't follow that,

662
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:58,529
你是说你不信仰上帝
you saying you don't believe in God.

663
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:01,347
印加人当然是信仰太阳神的
The Incas of course were sun worshippers

664
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,998
这个你们都很清楚
as you seem to know well.

665
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:06,388
这是基于气象的原因
The reason was meteorological

666
00:46:06,468 --> 00:46:09,273
夜里没有太阳 作为山地的居民
without sun at night being mountain dwellers

667
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,890
他们会冷得发抖
they shiver, they freeze.

668
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:15,011
住在海边的人呢?
What about those on the coast?

669
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:21,116
太阳是永恒不变的
The sun was constant.

670
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,633
是天上的暴君
A tyrant in the sky.

671
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:27,065
所以他们崇拜的是相对小一些的神明
And so it was the lesser god they worshiped,

672
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:28,866
月亮
the moon.

673
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:33,459
月宫
the house of the moon

674
00:46:33,533 --> 00:46:36,825
小孩被拿去祭月
The young children were sacrificed.

675
00:46:36,906 --> 00:46:39,747
躺在五颜六色的羽绒和棉花床上
Lying on beds of colored wool and cotton.

676
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:41,868
为什么呢?
Why?

677
00:46:41,944 --> 00:46:43,883
为什么要把小孩当作祭品?
Why must the children be sacrificed?

678
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:49,340
呃 不只是小孩 Jack
Well not just the children Jack.

679
00:46:49,414 --> 00:46:50,998
当部落酋长死去的时候
When the chieftain died

680
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,860
习俗就是让他最心爱的 最漂亮的女人一起陪葬
it was customary to bury him with the most beautiful and best loved women.

681
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:58,159
天哪 他的妻子吗?
Good God his wife?

682
00:46:58,238 --> 00:47:01,565
他的妻子
His wife.

683
00:47:01,645 --> 00:47:05,008
还有他最心爱的妾氏
His favorite concubines.

684
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,189
或多或少
And a considerable number more or less

685
00:47:07,273 --> 00:47:12,792
还有数量可观的仆人 珠宝 天然的银子
of his servants, His jewels, raw silver,

686
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:18,207
僧侣 武器 食物和衣服
Iamas, weapons, food and clothing.

687
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:23,699
所以在他的哲学里 死即是生
So in his philosophy death was life.

688
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:27,733
当然了 为什么不是呢?
But of course why not?

689
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:30,861
那种气氛持续了好几个小时
It continued in that vein for hours.

690
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:34,534
各种各样的玄虚的理论
All kinds of mysticism.

691
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,867
大都是我无法理解的
Mostly beyond my comprehension.

692
00:47:36,946 --> 00:47:39,478
Malobar的寡妇们
The widows of Malobar.

693
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:41,170
在她们的丈夫遗体火化的烈焰中
Burnt themselves in the blaze

694
00:47:41,254 --> 00:47:42,778
自焚了
of the remains of their husbands

695
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:45,173
以示忠诚
as a demonstration of fidelity.

696
00:47:47,856 --> 00:47:49,345
我无法描述的是
What I can't describe

697
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,261
他的话对在场的人的影响
is the effect it had on the company,

698
00:47:52,338 --> 00:47:54,764
特别是女士们
the ladies in particular.

699
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,872
就好像他给她们施了催眠术一样
It was if he had them mesmerized.

700
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:06,295
还有在他离开之后 Carlotta...
And yet after he left, Carlotta...

701
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:07,900
他真是令人厌恶
He was repulsive.

702
00:48:07,973 --> 00:48:09,356
你觉得他...
You found him?

703
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,195
令人厌恶
Repulsive.

704
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:13,072
你不想我们再见到他吗?
You'd rather we didn't see him again?

705
00:48:13,152 --> 00:48:14,605
他是你的朋友
He's your friend.

706
00:48:17,703 --> 00:48:19,014
过来
Come to me.

707
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:24,190
第二天早上之后
The following morning

708
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:27,906
我就从此成了
hence subsequently

709
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:30,792
她发泄痛苦的对象
I became the object of her pain.

710
00:48:30,872 --> 00:48:33,440
但是Stockton和你的孩子的死
But the connection with Stockton

711
00:48:33,512 --> 00:48:35,001
之间的联系呢?
and your baby's death.

712
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:36,731
我是说 如你所述
I mean as you describe the evening

713
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,883
两者之间很难形成什么联系啊
it's hard to forge a link.

714
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:42,472
我知道 可是从那晚上起
I know but it all went wrong Watson

715
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:44,972
一切就都不对劲了 华生
from that evening.

716
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:50,115
屋子里就像笼罩着一团乌云...
This house was if there was a black cloud...

717
00:48:50,189 --> 00:48:53,444
我无法描述 我真希望我能说得清楚
I can't describe it I wish to God I could.

718
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:55,986
有那么多的巧合
There's so many coincidence.

719
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,260
啊 Jack
Ah Jack.

720
00:49:01,345 --> 00:49:02,519
这是我的儿子 Jack
My son, Jack.

721
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:03,621
过来见见我的朋友们
Come and meet my friends,

722
00:49:03,662 --> 00:49:06,564
华生医生和福尔摩斯先生
Dr. Watson and Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

723
00:49:07,665 --> 00:49:09,356
我打扰你们了
I'm interrupting.

724
00:49:09,439 --> 00:49:11,592
Jack 你丝毫没有打扰我们
Jack you're not interrupting at all

725
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:14,362
过来坐下跟我们谈谈
now come and sit down and talk to us.

726
00:49:14,443 --> 00:49:16,240
音乐怎么样了 Jack?
How's the music Jack?

727
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,230
你还在练习小提琴吗?
You still practicing the violin?

728
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,521
Jack得到了一把新的小提琴
Jack's been given a new violin,

729
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,089
是他继母给他的礼物
a gift from his stepmother.

730
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:26,800
旧的那把音色不错啊
The old one plays rather well, usually.

731
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,749
福尔摩斯也会拉小提琴
Holmes plays the violin.

732
00:49:28,828 --> 00:49:30,474
等你继母完全康复了 Jack
I look forward to meeting your stepmother Jack

733
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:32,606
我很想见见她
when she's sufficiently recovered.

734
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:34,067
当然了
Indeed.

735
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:36,641
我们看看现在合不合适吧
Well let us see if now is not the moment.

736
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:38,584
Mason太太 麻烦你到楼上去一下好吗?
Mrs. Mason would you go upstairs?

737
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:42,714
噢 她不在房间里 先生
Oh she's not in her room sir.

738
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:44,629
她很早就出去了
She went out early.

739
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:46,017
不在吗?
Not.

740
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:47,479
你怎么没告诉我?
Well why didn't you tell me this?

741
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:48,939
呃 我以为你知道呢
Well I thought you knew?

742
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:51,264
她们两个都出去了 父亲
They both went out father.

743
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:52,405
单独出去吗?
Alone?

744
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,873
Stockton先生来接她们
Mr. Stockton came for them.

745
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,783
他是来关心她们的 先生
He came to pay his respects sir.

746
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,391
就是你在外头骑马的时候 父亲
When you were out riding father.

747
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:00,513
你看见她们跟他一起走了吗?
And you saw them leave with him?

748
00:50:00,586 --> 00:50:03,605
我的妻子和女仆? 自愿的吗?
My wife and the maid willingly?

749
00:50:03,678 --> 00:50:04,918
你们俩都看见了吗?
You both witnessed this?

750
00:50:04,998 --> 00:50:07,625
噢 他们说就去兜一下风
Oh just for a short drive they said.

751
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:10,407
到户外去 让她们的脸色红润起来
To take the air, put color in their cheeks.

752
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:21,736
真的该让我知道
I really should have been informed of this.

753
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:23,434
我的妻子还不太舒服
My wife is not herself.

754
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:24,794
是Stockton先生
Was it Mr. Stockton

755
00:50:24,874 --> 00:50:26,742
说服她去兜什么愚蠢的风吗?
who persuaded her on this foolish drive?

756
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,129
是谁鼓动的?
Who instigated it?

757
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:29,864
你怎么这么担心呢 父亲?
Why does it worry you father?

758
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:32,924
三个都没事 Ferguson先生 他们回来了
All's well Mr. Ferguson, they're coming home.

759
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:57,997
Stockton?
Stockton?

760
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:01,834
我不知道你要来
I didn't realize you had come by.

761
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:03,779
你本该告诉我的
I wish you would have told me.

762
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:05,312
女士们怎么样了?
How are the ladies?

763
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:06,735
很好
Very well.

764
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,093
我们在乡间兜了一圈 很愉快
We had a pleasant drive through the countryside.

765
00:51:09,174 --> 00:51:10,577
空气清新
The air is fresh.

766
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,006
走了
Move on.

767
00:51:14,768 --> 00:51:16,423
他真够有胆量的
Nerve of him.

768
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,553
那么你并无偏见了?
You keep an open mind then?

769
00:51:48,316 --> 00:51:50,848
全然违背逻辑 我想是的
Against all logic I suppose yes.

770
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:53,662
那歇洛克 福尔摩斯呢?
And Sherlock Holmes?

771
00:51:54,676 --> 00:51:56,414
在英国的犯罪领域中
Such things do not happen

772
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,881
还不曾发生过这样的事情
in criminal practice in England.

773
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:03,112
有僵尸走过这片土地
The notion of the undead walking this earth

774
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,664
拿无辜的妇女们饱餐一顿
feasting off innocent females

775
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:09,011
这种想法违背了他的理性认知
offends against all his reasoning.

776
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,458
作为一名神职人员
What is your own view Reverend

777
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:13,065
您的看法是什么 牧师?
as a man of the church?

778
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:18,005
生与死都是神秘的 医生

福尔摩斯 本地的医生病倒了

我的第一次出诊是去看旅馆老板的女儿

791
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:13,700
她病得不轻

00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,348
葬礼之后

她不会死吧 医生?

不会的 但会经历一个危险期

00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:56,422
现在该让她睡觉
She should sleep now.

这个村子瘟疫流行了吗?
This village is plagued.

801
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:01,761
就像其他许多村庄一样
Like many another at this time of the year

00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:03,563

妈妈 别哭了

就只有麻烦
there's nothing but trouble

815

在一个被死亡和阴暗笼罩的乡村?

00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:24,561
你会把手放在胸口

00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:25,670
发誓你不是来调查我的吗?
and say your not investigating me?

832
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:26,743
怎么了? 你干了什么?
Why what have you done?

00:57:27,353 --> 00:57:28,280
会有几个人告诉你
There are several who will tell you

836
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:34,590
流言不是真相

837

我只是在过我的日子 福尔摩斯
I'm living my life Holmes.

838
00:57:38,073 --> 00:57:39,356
一个人还能干什么呢?

841
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:45,886
-但那不是... -我的主业?
But that is not... My main occupation?

842
00:57:45,949 --> 00:57:46,195
不是的
No.

843
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:48,024

00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:54,849
在那个领域我是小有名气的
I have a modest reputation in that field.

847
00:57:55,277 --> 00:57:55,939
出版过什么吗?
Published?

848
00:57:56,952 --> 00:57:57,279
两本书
2 books.

849
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:00,081
你对我的研究领域熟悉吗?

850
00:58:01,046 --> 00:58:02,993
我到东方旅行过

852

现在则是宁静的英国乡村了

853
00:58:13,163 --> 00:58:14,747
我在对家族的历史做些小小的溯源

村里人都觉得我的祖先们是吸血鬼

Janet Barrows
Janet Barrows,

859
00:58:30,962 --> 00:58:32,490
你曾带了一朵玫瑰去了她的墓地
whose grave you were at with a rose.

860
00:58:32,626 --> 00:58:33,685
你很善于观察
Observant of you.

861
00:58:35,552 --> 00:58:39,362
他们烧了这座房子 肆无忌惮的复仇
They burnt this house an act of unbridled revenge.

862
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:42,546
而现在他们都在愧疚中煎熬
And now they suffer from the guilty fear

863
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:44,448
唯恐我回来惩罚他们
that I've come back to punish them.

864
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:46,709
那是否就是你的目的?
Is that your purpose?

865
00:58:48,097 --> 00:58:49,769
毫无意义的担忧
What a pointless exercise.

866
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:52,687
来吧 我带你到处看看
Come let me show you around.

867
00:58:56,517 --> 00:58:58,843
我跟你一样 是来调查的
I am like yourself, an investigator.

868
00:58:59,796 --> 00:59:01,373

不行
No.

870

在你看来 世上是否有吸血鬼存在?
Do vampires exist in your philosophy?

872
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:11,968
以人的形式存在嘛 也许有的
In human terms perhaps.

873
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:14,859
那么你现在看到的是不是一只吸血鬼呢?
And are you looking at one now?

874
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:23,141
这座房子从前肯定散发着糜乐的气息
From this house must have emanated one spoiled from conviviality.

875
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,887
我也许就是回来重拾这种气息的
I may come back to restore it.

876
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:32,404
乡村生活对我来说甚为无趣
Life in the village holds few delights for me.

877
00:59:38,498 --> 00:59:40,833
你为什么要把Ferguson太太带到这儿来?
Why did you bring Mrs. Ferguson here?

878
01:00:47,842 --> 01:00:48,225
不  不要

你够不够朋友?
Are you a friend?

883
01:01:10,096 --> 01:01:10,621
当然
Yes.

884
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:11,564
我是你的朋友
Your friend.

885
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,042
我不能告诉任何活着的人

我不能
I cannot.

889
01:01:16,855 --> 01:01:17,907
你不能说什么?
What can't you tell?

890
01:01:19,147 --> 01:01:20,885
死亡女神
Mistress Death.

891
01:01:24,104 --> 01:01:25,063
她和我们在一起
She is with us.

892
01:01:27,696 --> 01:01:29,256
她贪得无厌
insatiable.

893
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,820
让她离我远远的!
Keep her away from me!

894
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:05,804

哦 药物会治好他们的病

01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:19,770
你妻子发烧吗?
Does your wife have a fever?

900
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,691
让我看看她吧
Let me visit.

901
01:02:21,567 --> 01:02:23,325
她所得的病非药物可以治疗
What she has is beyond medicine.

902
01:02:24,638 --> 01:02:25,957
它占据了她的灵魂
It's taken charge of her soul,

903
01:02:27,371 --> 01:02:28,376
深入骨髓
her very bones.

904
01:02:29,532 --> 01:02:30,759
不是悲伤吗?
Is it not grief?

905
01:02:31,513 --> 01:02:32,867
不是的 我知道悲伤是什么样子
No I recognize grief.

906
01:02:33,657 --> 01:02:34,543
我理解悲伤的感觉
I understand grief.

907

这是某种毒害
This is some other poison

908
01:02:39,517 --> 01:02:41,124
我们都知道它是从哪儿来的
and we know its source you and I.

909
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:45,799
我该怎么做呢 华生?
What am I to do Watson?

910
01:02:45,988 --> 01:02:48,012
袖手旁观 让他把我们所有人都毁掉吗?
Just stand aside and it him destroy all?

911
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:49,539
放松些 老朋友
Easy old man.

912
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,977
福尔摩斯怎么看?
What does Holmes make of it?

913
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,760
他觉得我们都疯了吗?
Does he think were all mad?

我见到了一个鬼
I've seen a ghost.

你见过?

917

鬼是不会让你感兴趣的
It didn't appear to you.

918
01:03:28,765 --> 01:03:29,506
这个鬼就会
This one did.

919
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:32,295
表面看上去是的
Appear so.

920
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:36,059
似乎我太接近了
It seems I got too close.

921

哦 她会康复

没有比流感更险恶的了

926
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,193
似乎年轻人之中流感爆发得特别厉害
It seems to have struck the young in particular.

927
01:03:47,851 --> 01:03:48,890
年轻人?
The young?

928

村里有六个女孩传染上了
Half a dozen young girls of the village.

929
01:03:50,955 --> 01:03:51,702
流感吗?
Influenza?

930
01:03:52,223 --> 01:03:53,303
具有所有常见的病症:

931

01:04:17,394 --> 01:04:21,204

938
01:04:23,247 --> 01:04:25,727
活人也可以做出这样的举动
A living person might attempt such behavior.

939
01:04:26,717 --> 01:04:29,177
你是说Stockton就是其中一个?
Your saying Stockton is one of these creatures?

940
01:04:29,326 --> 01:04:30,255
我们知道
There are people we know

941
01:04:30,418 --> 01:04:33,499
有些人像海绵那样吸食他人的能量
who suck up the energies of others like a sponge.

942
01:04:34,874 --> 01:04:36,125
把他们的活力都吸取出来据为己有
Draw out their resources

943
01:04:36,636 --> 01:04:38,154
使他们虚弱不堪
and pocket them leaving them fatigued.

944
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:41,409
再也无法控制自己的意志
No longer master of their wills.

945
01:04:42,776 --> 01:04:44,020
这是一种心理现象
It's a psychological phenomenon.

946
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:45,673
医生们也都公认这一点
Doctors have acknowledged it.

947
01:04:47,313 --> 01:04:48,139
是的 这种人确实存在
Yes they exist.

948
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:51,311
在某种程度上 你所说的的确符合
What you say does describe in some measure

949
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:53,554
与那天晚上他来用餐时的景象
that night he came to dinner

950
01:04:54,374 --> 01:04:57,918
还有他对Carlotta与女仆的影响
and the effect he had on Carlotta and the maid.

951
01:04:58,965 --> 01:05:00,762
刚才我自己也感受到了
I had a taste of it myself just now.

952
01:05:02,183 --> 01:05:03,795
你那撞鬼的经历呢?
And your ghostly experience?

953
01:05:04,617 --> 01:05:06,474
目前我不相信我所看到的景象
I don't, for the moment, believe what I saw.

954
01:05:09,345 --> 01:05:10,571
但我的确接受了那种幻觉
But I do accept hallucination.

955
01:05:12,021 --> 01:05:14,022
另一个人强迫我的心智欺骗了我
The mind forced by another to play tricks.

956
01:05:15,603 --> 01:05:16,642
催眠
Hypnosis.

957
01:05:17,763 --> 01:05:19,672
Stockton曾跟南美印第安人
Stockton has spent much time

958
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:21,158
一起呆过很长的时间
with the South American Indians

959
01:05:22,557 --> 01:05:24,171
研究他们古老的秘密
studying their ancient mysteries.

960
01:05:26,275 --> 01:05:27,258
他很有可能
It's quite possible

961
01:05:28,876 --> 01:05:30,271
在那里学到了什么
that he learned something out there.

962
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:32,892
受到一次经历的影响
Was effected by an experience.

963
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:35,829
但你并没有因此就证明他无罪吧?
But you don't exonerate him for that surely?

964
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:39,983
没有 但他很有可能得了某种病 治疗以后也许会有起色的
No but he could be suffering a form of illness, which may respond to treatment.

965
01:05:40,484 --> 01:05:41,993
那我们就只能让他滥杀无辜了?
And meanwhile we let him run amuck?

966
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,085
那家伙是很有破坏性的
The man is destructive.

967
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,471
福尔摩斯 你不会否认这一点吧?
Holmes you're not denying that.

968
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:48,529
如果我们任由他破坏...
He's only destructive if we let him be.

969
01:05:50,504 --> 01:05:51,859
如果我们相信太多的神话...
If we believe too many tales

970
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:55,130
或者或多或少 把他当成我们内心恶意的载体
or use him as nothing more or less

971
01:05:55,654 --> 01:05:57,056
他才会有破坏性
than a depository for our own ills.

972
01:05:58,818 --> 01:06:00,028
你是说我就是这么干的吗?
Are you suggesting that I am doing that?

973
01:06:00,547 --> 01:06:02,446
我想村子里本身就有危机
I think there's a danger of it in this village.

974
01:06:03,305 --> 01:06:04,000
我跟这个村子站在一起 福尔摩斯
I stand with this village Holmes,

975
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:05,097
我住在这里
I live here

976
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:07,798
而且我还看到了他对他人造成的直接影响
and I have seen his direct influence over people.

977
01:06:08,312 --> 01:06:08,968
对我们所爱的人
Loved ones.

978
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:12,331
一个无辜的毫无防备能力的婴儿死了
A defenseless, innocent baby is dead.

979
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:16,616
如果你还觉得那是正确的 我们就只好分道扬镳了
Now if you can justify that we part company.

980
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:20,309
晚安 福尔摩斯
Good night Holmes.

981
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:26,849
对问题做出诊断是一回事 华生
It's one thing to diagnose the problem Watson.

982
01:06:27,508 --> 01:06:29,539
而通常要解决它又是另一回事
It's quite another, often, to resolve it.

983
01:06:40,136 --> 01:06:40,760
是的 小姐
Yeah your ladyship

984
01:06:41,181 --> 01:06:43,123
这是一个绝对灵验的护身符
here is a charm that cannot fail.

985
01:06:44,092 --> 01:06:46,542
把它别在你的枕头上
Pin this to your pillow and you can laugh.

986
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,022
那对着夜里来犯的伪君子和吸血鬼
Laugh in the face of vampires

987
01:06:50,727 --> 01:06:53,697
你就可以当面耻笑他们了
and hypocrites that visit in the night.

988
01:06:55,309 --> 01:06:57,871
只需六便士就可以保证你的安全
Your safety a sixpence.

989
01:07:00,747 --> 01:07:02,147
有个骗子在招摇撞骗
There's a jackal at work.

990
01:07:02,306 --> 01:07:03,228
我要去伦敦了
I'm off to London.

991
01:07:03,617 --> 01:07:04,134
伦敦?
London?

992
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,061
你可以坚守堡垒到黄昏吗?
Till nightfall will you hold the fort?

993
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:07,359
当然可以
Certainly.

994
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:08,850
我觉得拜访一下Carlotta Ferguson
I thought a visit to Carlotta Ferguson

995
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:09,898
也许会有些帮助
might be useful.

996
01:07:10,134 --> 01:07:11,983
作为医生 我也许可以进去看她
As a doctor I might get in to see her.

997
01:07:12,203 --> 01:07:12,478
有意思
Interesting.

998
01:07:13,255 --> 01:07:14,500
同时跟她丈夫重修旧好
Also patch things up with her husband.

999
01:07:15,172 --> 01:07:15,971
没必要让他反对我们
No point in having him against us.

1000
01:07:16,589 --> 01:07:17,106
没错
Quite so.

1001
01:07:19,976 --> 01:07:22,846
Saint Sebastian会守护你的心灵
Saint Sebastian, he will protect your heart

1002
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:26,445
免受吸血鬼 和常见的邪恶的侵害
from vampires and prevalent malignants

1003
01:07:27,036 --> 01:07:29,763
比如盗尸贼 蝙蝠和吸血蝙蝠
such as ghouls, bats and bat suckers.

1004
01:07:31,365 --> 01:07:33,787
给九便士就是你的了
Yours for nine pennies only.

1005
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:40,150
给你所爱的人吧 先生
For your loved ones sir.

1006
01:07:44,535 --> 01:07:45,584
她病倒了吧?
Taken back, was she?

1007
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:52,404
这个会打倒魔鬼 让他夜里不再光临
This will beat the devil and his night visits.

1008
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,724
它是藏在修女们的衣服里
It was smuggled in the habit of a nun

1009
01:07:57,732 --> 01:07:59,389
一路从罗马偷运过来的
all the way from Rome

1010
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:01,395
是以教皇的精神
and was forged

1011
01:08:02,714 --> 01:08:04,256
来铸造的
in his holiness own spirit.

1012

现在任何恶人都不能近我的身了

1014
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,051
别吵
Silence.

1015
01:08:17,321 --> 01:08:17,918
不许那样
Quit that.

1016
01:08:18,216 --> 01:08:18,949

1017
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:23,460
戒指环绕着蔷薇 口袋里装满了花束...

1018
01:08:33,245 --> 01:08:34,284
去车站

01:08:34,289 --> 01:08:35,263

1025

想问问经历了这么悲痛的损失后 你还好吧

需不需要什么有助睡眠的药物?

1046
01:11:46,358 --> 01:11:47,626
世上没有任何药物
There are no remedies in the world

01:11:48,508 --> 01:11:49,634
能让我夜里睡得着觉的 医生

是Stockton  是的

他昨天好心地把我带了出去

1062
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:23,460
跟我的女仆一起兜了风

1063
01:12:24,685 --> 01:12:25,454
你认识Stockton吗?
Do you know Stockton?

1064
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:26,916
不 我从未见过他
No I haven't met him.

1065
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:28,322
福尔摩斯认识他
Holmes knows him.

1066
01:12:29,067 --> 01:12:32,502
他昨天也坐车去了 一所废弃的旧房子

01:12:36,892 --> 01:12:38,106
只不过是座烧毁了的房子
It's just a burned out house.

1071
01:12:38,865 --> 01:12:40,043
我毫无兴趣
No interest to me.

01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:41,666
没有鬼吗?
No ghosts?

1073
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:43,616
我想有很多吧
Many I should think

1074
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:45,308
不过没有一个出来溜达的
but none came out to play.

1075
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,570
你觉得Stockton怎么样?
What do you make of Stockton?

1076

他似乎能激起人们强烈的情感

1077
01:12:51,302 --> 01:12:51,961
是什么情感呢?
What should that be?

1078
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:53,515
我说不清楚
I couldn't tell you.

1079
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:55,201
我只不过是听说的

你想听我对Stockton的看法吗?

呃 起初我不喜欢他
Well at first I disliked him

1082
01:13:03,527 --> 01:13:05,508
他对我的国家很感兴趣
then he was interested about my country.

1083
01:13:06,486 --> 01:13:08,033
又会讲我们的语言 于是我自然欢迎他
He speaks my language and so I welcome him.

1084
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:10,129
-可是村子里... -我对村子完全不了解
-But the village... -I know nothing of the village.

1085
01:13:12,444 --> 01:13:13,402
激烈的情绪  正如你说的
Strong feelings you say.

1086
01:13:14,907 --> 01:13:16,812
乡巴佬...英国的乡巴佬
Peasants...English peasants.

1087
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:22,040
而Stockton给了你一些安慰?
And Stockton offered you some consolation?

1088
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:26,523
他了解死去的人
He understands the dead.

1089
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:29,710
了解我们所发生的事情
What happens to us.

01:13:30,428 --> 01:13:31,540

知道我的小Ricardo去了哪里
Where my little Ricardo has gone.

1092
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:36,778
那是我仅有的安慰
It's the only solace I have.

1093
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,475
从你丈夫身上你得不到安慰吗?
You have none with your husband?

1094
01:13:38,855 --> 01:13:39,372
一点也没有
None.

1095
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:42,394
他干嘛要把我带到这么个糟糕的地方来?
Why did he bring me here to this terrible place?

1096
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:45,244
我告诉你吧 因为他想让我的小孩子
I tell you because he wanted my little baby

1097
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:47,862
变成一个像Jack那样的英国佬
to be an Englishman like Jack.

1098
01:13:48,655 --> 01:13:50,385
他想要另一个Jack
He wanted another boy like Jack.

1099
01:13:51,383 --> 01:13:54,751
死后埋在一个英国人的墓地里 就真的那么好吗?
Is that so wonderful to end up buried in an English grave?

1100
01:13:57,465 --> 01:13:58,858
要是我让你难过了 我深表抱歉
I'm sorry if I caused you pain.

1101
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:01,433
有什么关系呢?
Why not?

1102
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,865
你是位医生
You are a doctor.

1103
01:14:05,047 --> 01:14:06,338
了解真相当然更好
It is better to bring the truth out.

1104
01:14:07,084 --> 01:14:08,123
确实如此
Indeed.

1105
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:14,367
你会留下来用午餐吗?
And now you will stay for lunch?

1106
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:18,134
谢谢
Thank you.

1107
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,768
我留下来用了午餐还有下午茶
I stayed for lunch, tea.

1108
01:14:24,577 --> 01:14:25,717
在花园里喝茶
I had tea in the garden.

1109
01:14:26,206 --> 01:14:27,673
她是一个出色的女人
She's a remarkable woman.

1110
01:14:28,509 --> 01:14:29,527
非常有教养
Most cultured person.

1111
01:14:30,712 --> 01:14:32,178
我想就算是你也会觉得有她陪伴很愉快
I think even you would enjoy her company.

1112
01:14:32,354 --> 01:14:33,213
女仆呢?
And the maid?

1113
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,311
噢 女仆嘛  呃...
Awe now the maid well.

1114
01:14:36,855 --> 01:14:38,415
Michael的脖子上还有吻痕
There are still love marks on Michael's neck.

1115
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:41,967
我只是在回忆细节
And I'm only recalling the details

1116
01:14:42,309 --> 01:14:42,775
是因为你想听
since you asked for them.

1117
01:14:43,419 --> 01:14:43,993
Ferguson有没有在场?
And Ferguson's part all of this?

1118
01:14:44,872 --> 01:14:46,214
Ferguson是在下午三四点回来的
Ferguson returned mid afternoon.

1119
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:46,668
Jack呢?
And Jack?

1120
01:14:47,096 --> 01:14:47,429
Jack?
Jack?

1121
01:14:48,849 --> 01:14:49,500
Jack没有回来
Jack hadn't returned.

1122
01:14:50,087 --> 01:14:50,817
没人惦记他?
He wasn't missed?

1123
01:14:52,108 --> 01:14:53,542
谈起他一两次
Referred to once or twice but missed

1124
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:54,645
至于惦记嘛  我说不清
I couldn't tell you.

1125
01:14:56,169 --> 01:14:57,050
这里的那个女孩呢?
And the girl here?

1126
01:14:57,745 --> 01:14:58,814
从早上起一直那样
Unchanged since this morning.

1127
01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:01,624
你的伦敦之旅呢?
Your trip to London?

1128
01:15:03,901 --> 01:15:05,245
我觉得去Stockton的房间看看
I thought a visit to Stockton's room

1129
01:15:05,737 --> 01:15:06,847
也许更有帮助
might be more useful.

1130
01:15:08,118 --> 01:15:08,637
有没有发生什么事情?
Did anything happen?

1131
01:15:09,098 --> 01:15:09,608
没有
Nothing.

1132
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:12,693
活人和死人都没有出现
Neither the living nor the dead appeared.

1133
01:15:14,778 --> 01:15:16,867
不过尽管如此还是很有益处的
But it was instructive nonetheless.

1134
01:15:27,376 --> 01:15:27,818
他在哪儿?
Where is he?

1135
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:29,617
该死的孩子
Curse the boy.

1136
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:32,816
和你的朋友在一起吗?
With your friend?

1137
01:15:43,903 --> 01:15:44,489
呆在里头
Stay in.

1138
01:15:54,009 --> 01:15:54,788
进去
Get inside.

1139
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,498
Stockton 我要跟你谈谈
Stockton I want to talk to you.

1140
01:15:57,148 --> 01:15:57,665
进去
Get in.

1141
01:16:00,047 --> 01:16:00,541
进去!
Get in!

1142
01:16:04,475 --> 01:16:04,941
看看这里
See here.

1143
01:16:05,764 --> 01:16:06,755
你干的好事!
Your work.

1144
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:10,195
我的儿子 妻子 女仆
My boy, my wife, my maid

1145
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:12,013
都是你的了!
you'll have it all

1146
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:15,904
我们成了你乡村宿怨的一部分了
and we're a part of your village vendetta.

1147
01:16:16,668 --> 01:16:17,949
抱歉 你在说什么啊?
I'm sorry what are you talking about?

1148
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:21,107
你到底想从我们这儿得到什么?
What do you want from us?

1149
01:16:21,976 --> 01:16:22,917
是你把你的妻子介绍给我认识的
You introduced me to your wife.

1150
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:26,519
说英语 你这该死的
Speak English damn you.

1151
01:16:27,353 --> 01:16:28,390
说英语!
Speak English!

1152
01:16:30,603 --> 01:16:31,632
你竟敢侮辱我
How dare you insult.

1153
01:16:31,889 --> 01:16:32,928
不 够了
No enough.

1154
01:16:36,819 --> 01:16:38,614
现在把她带走 把你的同类带走
Now take her, take your creature

1155
01:16:39,949 --> 01:16:42,975
但是看在上帝的份上 留下我的妻子和儿子
but leave my wife and my boy for God's sake.

1156
01:16:44,817 --> 01:16:45,298
Jack  留下
Jack stay.

1157
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,026
留下 Jack
Stay Jack.

1158
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:47,923
放开他
Leave him.

1159
01:16:50,554 --> 01:16:51,317
让他走
Let him go.

1160
01:17:19,798 --> 01:17:20,092
Jack
Jack.

1161
01:17:20,671 --> 01:17:21,970
别打了 求你们了
Don't fight please.

1162
01:17:57,949 --> 01:17:59,509
我诅咒你 Stockton!
Curse you Stockton

1163
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:56,016
转过那个弯
Came around that bend

1164
01:18:57,615 --> 01:18:58,719
车速太快了
Traveling too quick.

1165
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:00,034
地很湿
It's wet.

1166
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,504
一次意外 福尔摩斯先生
An accident Mr. Holmes.

1167
01:19:04,415 --> 01:19:05,368
我的报告会这么写
That'll be my report.

1168
01:19:06,586 --> 01:19:07,948
结案了
Subject closed.

1169
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,040
正如你说的有点怪异  警官
A bit odd as you say constable.

1170
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:11,764
很好
Very good then.

1171
01:19:13,418 --> 01:19:15,143
过了今天你就要走了 是吧?
You'll be leaving over this day then will you?

1172
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:17,399
现在我们的问题解决了
Now are problem's gone.

1173
01:19:18,483 --> 01:19:19,281
我没有留下的理由
No reason for me to stay.

1174
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:22,700
我推断医生今早也有好转
And I gather the village doctor is better this morning

1175
01:19:23,073 --> 01:19:25,650
所以你也不再需要华生医生帮忙了?
so you won't be needing Dr. Watson's services either?

1176
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:26,976
是的
No.

1177
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,510
但是对他的帮助我们很感激
But his help was appreciated.

1178
01:19:30,909 --> 01:19:32,164
呃 来吧小伙子们
Well come on lads,

1179
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:34,391
把事情都干完吧
Iet's get over with.

1180
01:19:34,714 --> 01:19:35,234
意外吗?
Accident?

1181
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:35,761
哼
Huh.

1182
01:19:35,848 --> 01:19:36,471
谋杀?
Murder?

1183
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:38,561
更难解的谜团之一
One of the deeper mysteries.

1184
01:19:44,074 --> 01:19:45,537
他们会把他埋在哪儿?
Where will they put him?

1185
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:47,269
墓地里啊 还能是哪儿?
Graveyard where else?

1186
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:49,061
但他不能埋在那里
But he can't go there.

1187
01:19:49,566 --> 01:19:51,548
在我们的国家里 我们有时会火化尸体
In my country sometime they burn the body.

1188
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:53,895
这又不是你们的国家
Well this isn't your country.

1189
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:56,374
我们这儿可是文明的
We're civilized here.

1190
01:19:56,953 --> 01:19:58,154
那么你们会把他
So do you would throw him out

1191
01:19:58,581 --> 01:19:59,990
扔出去喂狼吗?
to be eaten by wolves?

1192
01:20:02,274 --> 01:20:03,532
你会把他埋在哪儿 Jack?
Where would you bury him Jack?

1193
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,204
我们说的可是你的朋友Stockton
It's your friend Stockton we're talking about.

1194
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:10,530
你饿吗 亲爱的?
You hungry dear?

1195
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:13,005
不
No.

1196
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:16,152
你干嘛那么看着我?
Why'd you look at me like that?

1197
01:20:16,844 --> 01:20:17,481
没什么
Nothing.

1198
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:28,609
呃 我得干活去了
Well I've got to work.

1199
01:20:30,346 --> 01:20:31,277
他撞上的是我那棵树
The tree that he hit was my tree.

1200
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,147
我从上面摔下来的那棵
The one that I fell from.

1201
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:35,717
你去看过那棵树吗?
You been to see it?

1202
01:20:36,783 --> 01:20:38,348
那不是你的树 Jack
No your tree Jack.

1203
01:20:38,885 --> 01:20:40,462
那棵树不在那条路上
It wasn't down that way.

1204
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:41,562
它就在那儿
It was.

1205
01:20:42,701 --> 01:20:44,194
正好是我发生意外的那棵树
The very same tree where I had my accident.

1206
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:47,492
那棵树应该是受过诅咒
Must have a curse on it.

1207
01:20:48,374 --> 01:20:49,342
我想看看
I want to see it.

1208
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,364
你带我去看好吗 Michael?
Would you take me Michael?

1209
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:53,290
现在不行
Not now.

1210
01:20:53,751 --> 01:20:54,853
你害怕了?
Are you afraid?

1211
01:20:56,266 --> 01:20:57,173
不 当然不是了
No of course not.

1212
01:21:02,697 --> 01:21:03,404
我带你去
I'll take you.

1213
01:21:06,022 --> 01:21:06,695
Michael?
Michael?

1214
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,446
如果你偏要去的话 就迟些时候吧
Later if you must.

1215
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:17,955
世人行动实系徒然
For man walketh in a vain shadow

1216
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:20,444
他们的忙乱亦是枉然...
and disquiet himself in vain.

1217
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:23,278
不是基督教的葬礼
No Christian burial.

1218
01:21:38,189 --> 01:21:39,450
她在抗议
Voicing her protest.

1219
01:21:30,231 --> 01:21:32,898


1220
01:22:03,409 --> 01:22:05,633
就像是颗炸弹 腐蚀了他的荣耀
Like it was a bomb fretting away his honor.

1221
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,318
于是每个人都归于虚无
Every man therefore is but vanity.

1222
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,598
我向您祈祷 我的主啊
Here my prayer O' Lord

1223
01:22:14,552 --> 01:22:17,053
请倾听我的呼唤
and with thy ears consider my calling.

1224
01:22:18,524 --> 01:22:21,121
对于我的眼泪求您不要静默无声
Hold not thy peace of my tears

1225
01:22:22,022 --> 01:22:23,385
因为在你面前我是一羁旅之人
for I am a stranger with thee

1226
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:27,339
像我的先人一般
and a sojourner as all of fathers were.

1227
01:22:30,114 --> 01:22:33,270
噢 求你宽容我 使我在去而不返之前
Oh spare me little that I may recover my strength

1228
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:37,570
重获力量...
before I go hence and be no more...

1229
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:38,350
Jack?
Jack?

1230
01:22:42,494 --> 01:22:42,976
去看看他
Go to him.

1231
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:57,441
噢 求你宽容我 让我重获力量
Oh spare me a little that I may recover my strength.

1232
01:23:02,288 --> 01:23:03,864
没事的
It's all right.

1233
01:23:21,026 --> 01:23:21,988
呃 我觉得是幽闭恐惧症
Well I think it was claustrophobia.

1234
01:23:23,028 --> 01:23:23,676
不是什么更糟的情况
Nothing worse.

1235
01:23:24,616 --> 01:23:26,312
有些人在教堂里就会这样
Some people get it in churches.

1236
01:23:27,732 --> 01:23:29,722
但是他以前每个周日 都在我的唱诗班里唱歌来着
But he used to sing in my choir every Sunday.

1237
01:23:30,993 --> 01:23:32,855
呃 他和Stockton关系比较密切
Well he and Stockton have become quite close.

1238
01:23:32,904 --> 01:23:34,528
对他来说应该是个很大的打击
It must have been a terrible shock.

1239
01:23:35,304 --> 01:23:36,774
有点像是那么回事
Sort of business.

1240
01:23:38,012 --> 01:23:39,523
村里人竭力反对
The village up in arms

1241
01:23:40,668 --> 01:23:43,455
但我不会反对为他举行基督教的葬礼的
but I couldn't deny the man a Christian burial.

1242
01:23:44,878 --> 01:23:44,588
我是说我怎么能反对呢?
I mean how could I?

1243
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:47,035
他做了什么呢?
What has he done?

1244
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:49,662
他有亲戚吗?
Did have any relatives as?

1245
01:23:51,086 --> 01:23:52,308
呃 据大家所知 没有
Well no one as far as anyone knows.

1246
01:23:52,874 --> 01:23:54,253
这又带来了另一个问题了
That's another problem you see.

1247
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:56,495
他的房子怎么办?
What to do with his cottage?

1248
01:23:56,973 --> 01:23:57,549
还有他的财产呢?
His possessions?

1249
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:01,519
我会去查查那些财产
I shall look over the premises.

1250
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:05,490
我们不问问警察吗?
Shouldn't we ask the police?

1251
01:24:06,823 --> 01:24:07,858
福尔摩斯知道该找什么
Holmes will know what to look for.

1252
01:24:18,517 --> 01:24:20,699
现在又开始干清理房子的活了吗 福尔摩斯?
In the business of house clearing now hey Holmes?

1253
01:24:20,762 --> 01:24:21,820
也许有益处
It may be instructive.

1254
01:25:13,227 --> 01:25:14,097
那儿有什么味道?
What's that smell in here?

1255
01:25:15,169 --> 01:25:16,139
向日花吗?
Heliotrope?

1256
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:17,792
是腐朽的味道
It's the smell of decay.

1257
01:25:19,497 --> 01:25:20,431
麻烦你把那灯点着 华生
Will you light that lamp Watson

1258
01:25:20,891 --> 01:25:21,847
我们就可以着手工作了
and then we'll set to work.

1259
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:45,118
鬼吗?
A ghost?

1260
01:25:45,878 --> 01:25:47,972
你要是想的话 我会爬上去把他摇下来
I'll climb up and shake him down if you like.

1261
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:49,324
要是他在上面的话
If he's up there.

1262
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:50,978
也吓不倒我啊
It doesn't frighten me.

1263
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,693
你吓不了我 Stockton
You can't frighten me Stockton.

1264
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,603
你已经埋在草下了
You're under the sod.

1265
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:57,049
那才是你该呆的地方
Where you belong.

1266
01:25:58,918 --> 01:26:00,529
你现在烦扰不了任何人了
You won't bother nobody now

1267
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:02,227
再也不会了
nor never again.

1268
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:07,354
Dolly?
Dolly?

1269
01:26:10,827 --> 01:26:12,209
得了 别玩愚蠢的游戏了
come on now don't play silly games.

1270
01:26:15,043 --> 01:26:15,815
Dolly?
Dolly?

1271
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:39,612
这是Stockton写的
Here's one by Stockton.

1272
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,700
秘鲁的宗教
Religions in Peru.

1273
01:26:47,809 --> 01:26:51,625
鱼神  蟹之神 飞狐之神
Fish god, Crab god, Fox god in Flight.

1274
01:26:56,429 --> 01:26:58,300
禁忌 魔法 巫术
Taboos, witchcrafts, sorcery,

1275
01:26:59,883 --> 01:27:02,195
还有什么这人没写到的吗?
is there nothing this man hasn't dabbled in?

1276
01:27:08,703 --> 01:27:09,404
吸血鬼
Vampires.

1277
01:27:11,133 --> 01:27:13,162
这儿有一本关于吸血鬼的书 福尔摩斯
There's a book here on vampires Holmes.

1278
01:27:23,065 --> 01:27:23,529
天哪!
My God!

1279
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:25,111
她受到了袭击
She's been attacked.

1280
01:27:25,302 --> 01:27:26,063
就在树下
Down by the tree.

1281
01:27:26,793 --> 01:27:27,409
就是他
It was him.

1282
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:33,109
会变成吸血鬼的人 通常是术士
Person to turn vampire generally wizards,

1283
01:27:34,845 --> 01:27:37,696
自杀者还有那些
suicides and those who come

1284
01:27:38,098 --> 01:27:40,299
横死或受到诅咒的人...
to a violent end or being cursed...

1285
01:27:40,587 --> 01:27:42,209
今晚有两个极好的实验品
Tonight 2 perfect specimens

1286
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:43,841
让我汲取力量
from whence I draw my strength.

1287
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:48,723
我的两位秘鲁女人让我重焕生机
My 2 Peruvian ladies revived me.

1288
01:27:49,228 --> 01:27:50,229
吸血鬼会把他的受害者
Vampire will bring his victim

1289
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:52,465
带到鬼门关前 却不会让他过去
to the foot of death but not beyond.

1290
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:55,224
他会照料他恢复健康
He will nurse it back to health

1291
01:27:55,619 --> 01:27:57,213
用之后所显示出来的爱...
with all the after occurrence of love...

1292
01:27:57,473 --> 01:28:00,880
然而现在也许我也受到了控制
And yet I might now also possess

1293
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:03,074
当我去到那房子的时候
when I visit the house

1294
01:28:03,853 --> 01:28:06,960
难道不是她让我放弃
is she not commanding me to relinquish,

1295
01:28:07,653 --> 01:28:10,154
让我把能力传给另一个人...
to hand my mantel on to another...

1296
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,035
事实上也许会再次被爱并把她吞噬
Indeed may be loved and devour her again

1297
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:16,511
这样他就可以永远得到滋养
whereby he's forever nourished.

1298
01:29:16,668 --> 01:29:17,421
他呼唤我
He called to me.

1299
01:29:19,249 --> 01:29:20,178
把你的梦境告诉我
Tell me your dream.

1300
01:29:23,234 --> 01:29:25,010
他让我带她到那儿去 我就照做了
She wanted me to take her there so I did.

1301
01:29:25,756 --> 01:29:27,322
本来她还站在那儿的
One minute she was standing there

1302
01:29:27,555 --> 01:29:28,236
一下子就不见了
then she was gone.

1303
01:29:29,391 --> 01:29:30,187
我看不到她
I couldn't see her.

1304
01:29:31,058 --> 01:29:32,296
接着她又在树旁出现了
Then she appeared again by the tree

1305
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,589
倒在我怀里
and fell into my arms.

1306
01:29:34,216 --> 01:29:35,614
脖子上有咬痕和血迹
On her neck were bites and blood.

1307
01:29:36,089 --> 01:29:37,188
是你留下的痕迹吗?
Did you make these marks?

1308
01:29:37,815 --> 01:29:39,760
不...不 先生 不是我 是Stockton
No...no sir not I it was Stockton.

1309
01:29:40,835 --> 01:29:41,662
你看见他了吗?
You saw him?

1310
01:29:41,829 --> 01:29:43,588
呃 没有 不过他就在那儿 错不了的
Well no but he was there right enough.

1311
01:29:44,549 --> 01:29:45,402
Stockton死了
Stockton is dead.

1312
01:29:45,532 --> 01:29:46,875
不 先生 他没死
No sir he is not

1313
01:29:47,089 --> 01:29:48,203
要么就是他是个活死人
or if it is it's the living dead

1314
01:29:48,726 --> 01:29:49,792
上帝可以作证
as God's my witness.

1315
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,428
看看她身上的齿痕吧 你们自己去看
See the mark on her, see for yourself.

1316
01:29:54,136 --> 01:29:55,926
吸血鬼并不存在
Vampires don't exist.

1317
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,648
Michael 看着我!
Michael look at me!

1318
01:30:00,434 --> 01:30:01,636
他们不存在
They don't exist.

1319
01:30:18,016 --> 01:30:19,571
那条狗怎么啦?
What's the matter with the dog?

1320
01:30:22,557 --> 01:30:23,918
像是有点四肢麻痹
It some form of paralysis.

1321
01:30:24,816 --> 01:30:26,222
是不是突然变成这样的?
Did it come on suddenly?

1322
01:30:27,313 --> 01:30:27,690
昨天吧
Yesterday.

1323
01:30:28,887 --> 01:30:31,864
很值得注意而且具有启发性
Remarkable and suggestive.

1324
01:30:33,046 --> 01:30:33,567
你说的是什么意思?
What do you mean?

1325
01:30:33,598 --> 01:30:35,337
这狗与什么事情有关吗?
What's the dog got to do with anything?

1326
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:37,859
此刻我无法告诉你
I can't tell you this instant.

1327
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,861
可以允许华生检查一下女仆吗?
May Watson be permitted to examine the maid?

1328
01:30:42,097 --> 01:30:42,564
当然了
Of course.

1329
01:30:49,108 --> 01:30:51,756
那人的死也许有部分是我造成的
The man's death perhaps in part I caused it.

1330
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:54,074
我不否认我发了脾气 福尔摩斯
I don't deny that I lost my temper Holmes.

1331
01:30:55,504 --> 01:30:57,730
但相比起这个家庭所遭受的痛苦 那算不上什么
But that's nothing.to the suffering that's been brought to this family,

1332
01:30:58,462 --> 01:31:00,309
我妻子 我的孩子
my wife, the baby boy

1333
01:31:01,197 --> 01:31:03,574
而现在又接着发生在女仆身上
and it continues to be brought now on the maid.

1334
01:31:04,879 --> 01:31:05,874
跟我解释啊 福尔摩斯
Explain that to me Holmes.

1335
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,140
早上好 Jack
Good morning Jack.

1336
01:31:12,730 --> 01:31:15,514
福尔摩斯先生 你就是那位侦探
Mr. Holmes, the detective.

1337
01:31:19,012 --> 01:31:20,470
Dolores好多了 父亲
Dolores is feeling better father.

1338
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,686
有点低烧 没别的了
It's a slight fever nothing worse.

1339
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:32,849
她昨晚跟Michael出去了
She was out with Michael last night.

1340
01:31:33,433 --> 01:31:34,481
他们遇上了暴风雨
They were caught in a storm.

1341
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:40,262
吻痕吗?
Lover's marks?

1342
01:31:43,152 --> 01:31:43,811
不是的
No.

1343
01:31:43,968 --> 01:31:45,274
那是什么?
Then what?

1344
01:31:48,338 --> 01:31:49,566
那棵树还是...
This is also the tree

1345
01:31:49,767 --> 01:31:51,091
Jack小时候摔下来的那棵呢
that Jack fell from as a boy

1346
01:31:52,008 --> 01:31:53,335
那次摔下来让他受了伤
that caused his injury

1347
01:31:55,311 --> 01:31:56,439
他就是这么告诉Michael的
or so told Michael.

1348
01:31:58,108 --> 01:31:59,405
Stockton和Jack?
Stockton and Jack?

1349
01:32:00,455 --> 01:32:02,319
太难以接受了
Now that's too much to swallow.

1350
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:03,689
Jack在撒谎
Jack was lying.

1351
01:32:04,506 --> 01:32:05,563
我问了Ferguson
I asked Ferguson.

1352
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:08,519
Jack的那棵树在林子的那一头
Jack's tree is in quite another part of the woods.

1353
01:32:09,369 --> 01:32:10,598
但是他为什么要撒谎呢?
But why should he lie about that?

1354
01:32:11,223 --> 01:32:12,501
为什么?
Why indeed?

1355
01:32:20,162 --> 01:32:21,200
我无能为力
Out of my hands

1356
01:32:21,565 --> 01:32:23,150
是警官决定的
it was the constable, he decided.

1357
01:32:23,428 --> 01:32:24,040
我们不能这样
We can't.

1358
01:32:24,096 --> 01:32:24,800
这是违背法律的
It's outside the law.

1359
01:32:25,544 --> 01:32:26,467
是一种侵犯
It's a violation.

1360
01:32:26,809 --> 01:32:28,384
亡灵们会怎么看呢?
Well what will the spirits make of it?

1361
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:03,623
我们要把他带去哪儿 Gresty先生?
Where we taking him Mr. Gresty?

1362
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:04,925
回到他该去的地方
Back to where he belongs

1363
01:33:05,314 --> 01:33:06,779
去他不能再危害村子的地方
where he can do this village no harm.

1364
01:33:26,929 --> 01:33:28,029
他想勒死我
He tried to strangle me.

1365
01:33:28,461 --> 01:33:29,491
来些水 Gresty太太
Some water please Mrs. Gresty?

1366
01:33:30,015 --> 01:33:33,562
像是只很大的黑色的动物 猫或是蜘蛛
It was like a big black animal, a cat or a spider.

1367
01:33:34,982 --> 01:33:36,749
手心有毛
It had hair on the inside of its hands.

1368
01:33:37,239 --> 01:33:38,347
掐住我的脖子
And they covered my throat.

1369
01:34:01,578 --> 01:34:03,399
那不过是个噩梦 Vera
It was just a bad dream Vera.

1370
01:34:05,158 --> 01:34:06,284
只是个噩梦
Just a bad dream.

1371
01:34:18,121 --> 01:34:19,701
我不喜欢这里 Gresty先生
I don't like it here Mr. Gresty

1372
01:34:19,709 --> 01:34:21,270
我们把他扔了 赶紧走吧
Let's drop him and get out fast.

1373
01:34:21,824 --> 01:34:22,584
放在这儿
Down here.

1374
01:34:23,263 --> 01:34:24,737
我们还干点别的吗?
Are we going to do the other thing?

1375
01:34:25,239 --> 01:34:25,759
干什么 Michael?
What's that Michael?

1376
01:34:25,764 --> 01:34:27,994
我们怎么对付老鼠的 你知道吧?
You know what you do with the rats.

1377
01:34:28,321 --> 01:34:29,366
你是个很有点子的人哪 小子
You've been a mind whip boy.

1378
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:30,819
我们不是 不是的
We haven't no.

1379
01:34:32,307 --> 01:34:33,834
我不去那儿  我不去
I'm not going down there I won't.

1380
01:34:34,288 --> 01:34:35,156
那是什么?
What's that?

1381
01:34:36,495 --> 01:34:37,230
是块耳朵
It's from an ear.

1382
01:34:37,967 --> 01:34:39,025
会是谁呢?
Who can it be?

1383
01:34:49,536 --> 01:34:50,816
发生了一起亵渎神明的事件 华生
There's been a desecration Watson.

1384
01:34:52,348 --> 01:34:55,479
我想 Stockton回到了他先辈们的住地
Stockton has been returned to the home of his forbearers I would imagine.

1385
01:34:56,555 --> 01:34:57,989
这是警察或主教该管的事
It's the matter of the police or the bishop

1386
01:34:58,511 --> 01:34:59,969
目前不该是我们操心的
no concern of ours for the moment.

1387
01:35:00,797 --> 01:35:01,435
女孩子怎么样了?
How's the girl.

1388
01:35:01,984 --> 01:35:03,146
睡得很安稳
Oh she's calm sleeping now.

1389
01:35:03,783 --> 01:35:04,311
有什么痕迹吗?
Marks?

1390
01:35:04,724 --> 01:35:05,406
连一道抓痕都没有
Not a scratch.

1391
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:06,327
窗户呢?
Window?

1392
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:07,554
从里面闩上了
Bolted from the inside.

1393
01:35:08,005 --> 01:35:08,914
那就是癔病了
The case of hysteria then.

1394
01:35:09,876 --> 01:35:11,596
但是那个Ferguson的女仆 福尔摩斯 我发誓...
But the Ferguson maid Holmes, I swear...

1395
01:35:11,629 --> 01:35:12,821
是的 我们是该认真对待
Yes that we must take seriously.

1396
01:35:13,344 --> 01:35:14,508
-你来吗? -当然了
-You coming? -Of course.

1397
01:35:46,151 --> 01:35:46,815

1398

她的嘴上滴着血  他看见了
Shed blood on her mouth he saw it.

1399
01:36:24,302 --> 01:36:25,968
她跟那个Stockton
She and that man Stockton,

1400
01:36:26,555 --> 01:36:28,149
他们两个都是吸血鬼
both of them vampires.

1401
