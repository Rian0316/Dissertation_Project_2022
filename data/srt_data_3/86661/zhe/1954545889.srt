00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:43,062
I don't know.

27
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:45,144
也许是某种古怪的祭礼吧
Some outlandish cult perhaps.

28

只呆在自己房间里

This is my house,

就算她这么说了 当然我很怀疑
Even if she said it, which I doubt.

97
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,213
您怀疑我的话?

我会非常惊讶
I would be most surprised

99
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,007
如果我妹妹允许我的房客使用厨房

我将十分感激 先生
if you left the kitchen now, Monsieur.

我觉得您没听到我在说什么
I don't think you hear what I'm saying?

110
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,893
Now you ask her what she gave me.

111

我给过一次
I believe I did, once.

115
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,557
-我没想到他会... -问她
I didn't realize he'd...

116
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:33,473
你是什么意思 到底怎么回事
Ask her.

117
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:34,614
问她
What do you mean, what's going on?

118
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,981
Ask her!

119
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,953
你们英国人真是伪善
You English are such hypocrites.

120
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:39,813
你现在告诉她你给了我什么
Now you tell her what you gave me.

121
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,037
什么?
What?

到那儿住去吧
Go and live there then.

你在旅店会有住处的
You'll have quarters at the mission.

130
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:12,909
去那儿
Go there.

131
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,347
我不想你留在我家
I don't want you under my roof.

132
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:16,528
走
Go.

133
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,502

你立刻离开我家

137
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:26,502
立刻
Immediately.

138
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,520
不然我就叫警察
Or I will call the police.

139
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,807
你的行李将被打包后留在旁门那
Your belongings will be packed

140
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,166
and left at the tradesmen's entrance

141
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,476
你怎么敢
for your collection.

142
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,493
How dare you!

143
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,388
你简直和妈妈一模一样
You sound exactly like mother.

144
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:43,397
那又如何
And what if I do?

145
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:44,896
我还以为她过世后 自己再也不会
I thought I'd heard the last of that sort of thing

146
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,180
听到那样的话
when she died.

147
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,766
你怎敢如此说妈妈
How dare you talk about mother like that?

148
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,625
我像她有什么不好吗?
It's just as well I am like her.

149
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:52,384
不然我不知道我们家会发生什么
I don't know what would happen to this family otherwise.

150
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:55,414
你把我们都绑在你身边
Oh, you hold us all together do you.

151
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:58,058
你真伟大
How splendid you are.

152
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,577
你发现Mary不声不响
Do you realize that Mary has gone away

153
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:04,121
就离开了吗
without telling anyone?

154
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:06,278
好极了
Good.

155
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,682
她最终还是表现出了点勇气
She's showing some spirit at last.

156
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:11,569
你说这好极了?
You call that good?

157
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,453
有时候我觉得你不仅一事无成
Sometimes I think you're not just feckless,

158
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,231
而且故意推卸责任
I think you're deliberately irresponsible.

159
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,846
Mary已经结婚了
Mary is a married woman.

160
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,989
不是你的功劳
Well, no thanks to you.

161
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:25,184
你到最后都反对他们

179
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:24,629

What's that?

180
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:28,287
是棵圣诞树

181
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,934
一棵挪威云杉
it's a Norway spruce.

182
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,158
这位是Cushing小姐
This is Miss. Cushing.

183
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:39,862
Cushing小姐很担心她的妹妹Browner太太
Miss Cushing is concerned

184
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,895
about her sister, Mrs. Browner.

185
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:40,966
请继续

186
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:45,458
Cushing小姐最小的妹妹和她住得并不远

00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:49,482
just east of Camberwell.

189
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:52,558
Browner太太每周五都来她家喝茶
Mrs. Browner visits her

190
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:55,541
除非她通知了不来 而这也很少发生
every Friday for tea,

191
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,459
unless she sends excuses,

192
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:57,103
which is most unusual.

193
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,522
上个星期五 19号
Last Friday the 19th,

194
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:03,036
Browner太太既未送来消息亦未到来
Mrs. Browner failed to send excuses or to arrive.

195
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:06,206
于是Cushing小姐询问了她的房客
So, Miss Cushing has made inquiries at her lodgings

196
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,067
但是Browner太太打上个礼拜四起

197
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,639
就不曾露面

198
00:12:09,858 --> 00:12:11,807
听起来像是她失踪了
It sounds to me as though she has disappeared.

199
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,915
很显然 福尔摩斯
Evidently, Holmes.

200
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:16,365
她的失踪可能有一两个原因
There could be one or two reasons

201
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:17,072
我知道
for her disappearance.

202
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,157
要不就是她自己想失踪
Yes, I know.

203
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,051
要不就是有别的什么人希望她失踪
Either because she wished to disappear,

204
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,693
or because somebody else

205

你知道有什么原因
wished her to disappear.

206
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:25,895
可能使别人想让她消失吗
Do you know of any reason why

207
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:26,115
anyone else should wish her to disappear,

208

428
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:09,573

00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:12,492
什么?
Yes?

487
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:17,759
当时我不愿意承认这个事实
I was loathed to acknowledge it at the time.

488
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,675
为什么
Why was that?

489
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:21,139
我觉得我的姐妹
I didn't think a sister of mine

490
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:23,922
不该嫁给一个船员
should be marrying a steward.

491
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:25,102
现在呢
And now?

492
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,023
您现在感觉如何
How do you feel now?

493
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:31,302
我想Jim和Mary本可以幸福
I think Jim and Mary could be happy.

494
00:27:31,387 --> 00:27:32,594
您的意思是他们并不幸福?
You mean they weren't?

495
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:35,627
一开始是的
They were at first.

496
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:38,659
然后呢
What happened?

497
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:40,751
也许你该问问Sarah
Perhaps you should ask Sarah.

498
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:44,053
她在那里住过一阵子
She practically lived there for a while.

499
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:16,487
现在Browner先生在哪条船上?
Which ship is Mr. Browner serving with at present?

500
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:18,260
"五朔节"号
The "May Morning".

501
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:20,522
17号启程
She sailed on the 17th

502
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:22,929
开往比利时和荷兰
for Belgium and Holland.

503
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,891
圣诞节他们在鹿特丹
They were in Rotterdam over Christmas.

504
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:27,770
船员抽签
The crews draw lots

505
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,316
Jim今年运气不好
and Jim was unlucky this year.

506
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:33,940
Mary得和我和Sarah一起过圣诞节
Mary was to have spent Christmas with Sarah and me.

507
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:35,506
而现在Sarah
And now Sarah, of course,

508
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,607
在旅店做看守人
is Warden at the mission.

509
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,600
您是否不让她和您住一起?
Are you sad not to have her living with you still?

510
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,136
是的
Yes I am.

511
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:49,225
实话告诉你吧 福尔摩斯先生
Well to tell you the truth, Mr. Holmes,

512
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:51,772
我们俩相处得不好
things are not well between us.

513
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:54,103
你们吵架了?
You've quarreled?

514
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:55,709
为了什么?
What about?

515
00:28:55,787 --> 00:28:56,994
也许会和你妹妹
It may have a bearing

516
00:28:57,074 --> 00:28:58,911
Mary的失踪有关系
on what has happened to your sister Mary.

517
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,755
我知道
I know that.

518
00:29:00,835 --> 00:29:01,805
当然有关
Of course it does.

519
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,752
你以为我不知道吗
Do you think I don't know that?

520
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:06,298
我认为一切都是她的错
I blame her for everything.

521
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,309
Sarah?
Sarah?

522
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:09,150
当然
Of course.

523
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:11,247
Sarah
Sarah.

524
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:13,337
她老呆在Mary家
She spent far more time than was necessary

525
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:15,983
完全没有这个必要
at Mary's lodgings.

526
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:19,641
Jim和Mary才新婚
Jim and Mary were just married,

527
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,207
过着自己的新生活
making their own life,

528
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:23,855
结交新朋友
making their own friends.

529
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,450
而Sarah给他们介绍了Alec Fairbairn
Then Sarah introduced Alec Fairbairn to them.

530
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:31,860
我知道这不是好意
I know it was not generously done.

531
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:36,212
看起来Sarah是想羞辱Jim Browner
Sarah seemed to want to shame Jim Browner.

532
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:39,071
我不知道Jim对Sarah做了什么
I don't know what Jim had done to Sarah,

533
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,998
但好像她恨他
but she seemed to hate him.

534
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:45,825
我相信...
I believe that...

535
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,019
你相信什么
You believe what?

536
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:50,179
问她
Ask her.

537
00:29:50,264 --> 00:29:51,016
问Sarah
Ask Sarah.

538
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:53,460
她在这里收拾她的东西
She is here in the house collecting her things.

539
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:56,242
问她是不是想让Mary
Ask her if she did not mean Mary

540
00:29:56,324 --> 00:29:59,134
和Alec Fairbairn私奔
to go off with Alec Fairbairn.

541
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:02,204
这就是她的目的
That is what she wanted.

542
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:03,903
我知道
I know it.

543
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:13,412
她已经收到消息了
Ah, the message has been received then.

544
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:38,002
咖啡? 先生
Caf? Monsieur.

545
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,399
谢谢你的帮助 警督
Thank you for your help, Inspector.

546
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:48,105
这很难 福尔摩斯先生
It's very difficult Mr. Holmes.

547
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:50,655
我们不能忽视证据
We can't ignore the evidence,

548
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:51,759
我们知道了什么?
what've we got?

549
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:53,685
包裹里的两只耳朵
Two severed ears in a parcel.

550
00:30:53,762 --> 00:30:55,599
我们知道一个医学院学生Jacottet
We've got the medical student, Jacottet

551
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,694
他被赶出了这位女士的家
who's been thrown out of the lady's house.

552
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,295
强烈的动机
Strong motive.

553
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:01,872
包裹是19号从Harwich寄出的
Parcel postmarked Harwich on the 19th.

554
00:31:01,948 --> 00:31:04,273
他19号也在Harwich
He was in Harwich on the 19th.

555
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:06,009
只有这么多了
That's as good as you get.

556
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:08,239
你的推理很浅显易懂 Hawkins
Your logic seems foolproof Hawkins.

557
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:09,281
谢谢
Thank you.

558
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:13,431
遗憾的是我不能阻止此事登报
I just regret that I haven't been able

559
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,782
他们正在为明早的头版写这个报道
to keep it out of the newspapers.

560
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:15,000
They're running the story

561
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:18,710
他们也得到了Susan Chusing小姐的名字
in tomorrow morning's first edition.

562
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,033
They've also managed to get hold of

563
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,771
她不会喜欢这样的
Miss Susan Cushing's name.

564
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:20,959
可怜的女人
She won't like that.

565
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,372
Poor woman.

566
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:24,435
那么另一件案子 福尔摩斯先生
This other matter then, Mr. Holmes.

567
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:27,401
你也有想法了 是吧?
You've clearly got some thoughts on that,

568
00:31:26,226 --> 00:31:27,612
haven't you?

569
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:31,262
我相信
It is my belief,

570
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,600
某位华生医生的同行
that a member of Dr Watson's profession,

571
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,072
为了某种目的铤而走险
possibly of some distinction,

572
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:38,128
has overstepped the mark.

573
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,942
所有尸体都是拳击手的
The corpses all belong to pugilists,

574
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,281
业余或者其他的
amateur or otherwise.

575
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:47,813
搏斗太久的拳击手
What is the unfortunate characteristic of boxers

576
00:31:47,892 --> 00:31:50,667
有什么不幸的特征?
who have fought too long?

577
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:54,294
他们的脑部会留下很多创伤
Well, there can be such scarring of the brain

578
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,066
会像喝醉了酒似的
that they behave as if they're drunk,

579
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,355
说话含糊
slurred speech,

580
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:58,962
记忆缺失或者其他
loss of memory and so on.

581
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:01,609
他们变得头昏眼花
They become punch drunk.

582
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:03,307
正是如此
Precisely.

583
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,883
您是说有人在研究
You mean somebody is studying

584
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,012
脑部组织病理学?
the pathology of brain tissues?

585
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,265
我认为正是如此
For all the best reasons, I dare say.

586
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:10,971
他们研究的热情
And their passion for their subject

587
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,901
超过了他们的理性
has outrun their judgment.

588
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:15,439
Marcus Lanyon爵士
Sir Marcus Lanyon,

589
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:17,589
我赌一个月的工资是Marcus爵士
I'll wager a month's salary on Sir Marcus.

590
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:19,749
这正是他的专业
That's precisely his specialty

591
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,291
他没有耐心
and he is impatient to a fault,

592
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:22,229
冷血无情
ruthlessly impatient.

593
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:25,116
现在你知道了 警督
There you have it, Inspector.

594
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:49,746
(knock on door)

595
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:58,865
她很沮丧
She is very down.

596
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:00,535
下午她回来以后
Like this ever since

597
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,350
就一直这样
she got back here this afternoon.

598
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:07,646
Cushing小姐?
Miss Cushing?

599
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:10,405
你和你的妹夫Browner先生
Why did you quarrel

600
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,885
为何事争吵
with your brother-in-law, Mr. Browner?

601
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:15,277
什么
What?

602
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:17,069
你是谁 为何在此
Who are you, what are you doing here?

603
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:18,215
这位是歇洛克 福尔摩斯
This is Sherlock Holmes,

604
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:19,974
他正在调查你的妹妹
he is investigating the disappearance

605
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:21,311
Mary的失踪案
of you sister, Mary.

606
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:28,334
她和Alec Fairbairn跑了 就是这样
She's gone off with Alec Fairbairn that's all.

607
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,631
为什么?
Why?

608
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:33,837
她被她丈夫吓坏了
She had become frightened of her husband.

609
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,163
为什么
Why?

610
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,908
Jim Browner是个酒鬼
Jim Browner was a drunkard.

611
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:42,828
他打她
He offered her violence.

612
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:45,305
为人卑劣
He was beneath contempt.

613
00:33:45,382 --> 00:33:47,290
你对这对耳朵作何解释
What is your explanation for the severed ears,

614
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,858
Cushing小姐
Miss Cushing?

615
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:51,566
你见过那个硬纸盒子了
You saw that cardboard box.

616
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:52,789
在你姐姐家
At your sister's house.

617
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:57,177
那对耳朵是给你的 不是吗
Those severed ears were meant for you were they not?

618
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,928
这个信息是给你的
The message was for you.

619
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:03,382

621
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:10,210
他告诉我他会做些什么
He told me he might do something.

622
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:13,833
我没想到他会做这么恶心的事儿
I didn't realize he'd do anything so disgusting.

623
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,633
她在说谎 华生
She's lying, Watson.

624
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,216
她在空口说白话
She's lying through her teeth.

625
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:58,202
Gull在外面

然后?
And?

00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,028
正如你所认为
It's as you thought.

630
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,968
"五朔节"号于17号从伦敦出发

631
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:07,114
驶往登荷德

632
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:09,853
但是一个大桶松开了

633
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:11,105
使一个横梁脱了节
She sprang a plate,

634
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:12,733
必须进港维修

00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:14,054
在Harwich?

在Harwich?
To Harwich.

637

船员18号放假

Jim Browner今晚7点

00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,917
在Ramsgate下船
at seven o'clock this evening.

647
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,371
很好
Good.

648
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:51,796
我就知道我可以信任您
I knew I could rely on you.

649
00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:54,711
我可以信任您吗
And I can rely on you, can I?

650
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,550
你能
You can.

651
00:35:56,628 --> 00:35:58,730
Marcus Lanyon爵士这个名字
Does the name,

652
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:01,435
对你有什么意义吗
Sir Marcus Lanyon mean anything to you?

653
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,005
可能有
It might.

654
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,671
他会得到警告
He will be warned off.

655
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:10,421
您从中获利的工作将结束
And the orders from which you have been profiting will dry up

656
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:13,648
同样警察对您的兴趣也会随之消失
but so will the police interest in you.

657
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,386
我很满意这个结果
I'll be satisfied with that.

658
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:21,106
我们谈了笔好买卖 Gull先生
We've acquired a bargain, Mr. Gull.

659
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:34,810
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

660
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:36,411
等等
Hold on.

661
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:37,545
包裹上的绳结
The knots on the parcel

662
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,460
是单套结和接绳结
were a bowline and a sheet bend.

663
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:42,267
是的 水手结
Yes, sailors knots.

664
00:36:42,348 --> 00:36:43,693
你知道水手们一般
You know that sailors deliberately

665
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,564
不会磨刀
do not sharpen their knives.

666
00:36:45,642 --> 00:36:48,406
是的 除非有事故
Yes, in case of accidents.

667
00:36:48,487 --> 00:36:50,608
因此这个残忍的切割
Hence the crude amputations.

668
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,612
Harwich是关键
Harwich was the key

669
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:55,969
而Browner当时在那儿
and Browner was there.

670
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,636
现在我推测
Now, I suppose,

671
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:05,615
Browner意外回到家中
Browner returned unexpectedly,

672
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:10,398
发现他妻子和Fairbairn在一起
found his wife with Fairbairn.

673
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,581
他尾随他们
He followed them.

674
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,016
杀害了他们
He murdered them both.

675
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:17,680
各切下他们一人的耳朵
He severed an ear from each

676
00:37:17,764 --> 00:37:22,338
然后寄给Sarah Cushing
and sent them as he thought to Sarah Cushing.

677
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:27,188
当然他会立刻到那里
Of course, he will go there immediately.

678
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:30,696
他等不及要告诉她
He will be desperate for her to know

679
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:33,334
那两只耳朵是给她的
that the severed ears were for her,

680
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,415
而非给她姐姐
and not for her sister.

681
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,224
就是这样
Well, that being the case,

682
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,440
现在周日也有火车
the railway is operating

683
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:44,464
as if it were a Sunday.

684
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:45,125
为什么
Why?

685
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:47,813
因为还是圣诞期间
Because the Christmas holiday is still on.

686
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:51,901
你有没有意识到Browner 可能搭更早的火车?
Do you realize,

687
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:53,203
Browner could have caught a much earlier train.

688
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:56,109
不 我没有
No, I did not know.

689
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:24,654
Mary
Mary.

690
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,593
这是什么 福尔摩斯先生
What is this, Mr. Holmes?

691
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:43,809
一次你的特殊经历 警督
A unique experience for you, Inspector?

692
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:48,475
你或许能在知道一桩谋杀发生之前
You may apprehend a murderer

693
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:49,954
就抓到一个凶杀
before you have even acknowledged

694
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:51,444
there has been a murder.

695
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:27,700
是的
Aye.

696
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:29,611
你惊讶吧
Well you may stare.

697
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,694
看着我 Sarah Cushing
Look at me, Sarah Cushing,

698
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:37,135
这是你的拿手好戏
this is your handy work.

699
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,190
你做了什么 Jim?
What have you done, Jim?

700
00:39:39,265 --> 00:39:42,040
我做了什么?
What have I done?

701
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:45,277
是你做了什么
Aye, it's what you've done.

702
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,514
我求求你
I beg you, Jim,

703
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:51,302
好好看着我
look on me kindly.

704
00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:53,636
我做的一切
Whatever I did,

705
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:55,337
都是为了你
I did for you.

706
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,144
是你
It was you.

707
00:40:03,606 --> 00:40:06,310
是你毒害了她的思想
You poisoned her mind.

708
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:09,309
我这么做是为了你
I did it for you.

709
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:12,303
他们抓住了那个房客
They have arrested the lodger.

710
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:15,085
我告诉他们是他做的
I told them he did it.

711
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:17,976
他们丝毫没有怀疑你 Jim
They suspect nothing of you, Jim.

712
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:19,965
你可以逃脱
You can get away.

713
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,284
逃脱?
Get away?

714
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:25,499
你以为我能逃脱
You think I can get away.

715
00:40:25,578 --> 00:40:27,036
当一切没发生过
Put it all behind me,

716
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,176
你这么以为 不是吗
you think, do you,

717
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:29,764
你疯了
are you mad.

718
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:32,742
是我
It is me.

719
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,243
就在这儿
It's in here.

720
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:36,914
每一幕每一幕
Every last moment of it.

721
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:38,421
每天都在我面前
It comes out of the daylight at me,

722
00:40:38,497 --> 00:40:39,812
不断重现
it goes on and on.

723
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:43,226
自打犯案起 我不敢闭着眼睛睡觉
I tell you I dare not shut an eye in sleep

724
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:46,077
我不敢一个人呆着
since I did it.

725
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,285
I'm never without one or the other before me.

726
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:49,666
愿你的血在你的血管里腐败
May the blood rot in your veins, Sarah Cushing.

727
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:51,509
不 不
No, no.

728
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,269
我爱你
I love you,

729
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:58,088
我爱你
I love you.

730
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,185
我爱你
I love you,

731
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:03,487
-我爱你 -我相信
I love you.

732
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,696
I believe you do.

733
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,096
我告诉你
I tell you something,

734
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,495
我宁愿从被我杀死的她口中听到一个字
I'd rather have one kind word

735
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:10,596
也不要你的爱
from her I've killed than all your love.

736
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:13,792
我宁愿看着她多呼吸一分钟
I'd rather see her breathing one minute more

737
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,646
也不要你给我一辈子
than a lifetime of what you could give me.

738
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,376
别这么说 别这么说
Don't say that,

739
00:41:17,427 --> 00:41:18,397
don't say that,

740
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:19,572
don't say that.

741
00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:31,657
她爱我
She loved me.

742
00:41:33,932 --> 00:41:37,265
这就是一切的根源
That's the root of the business.

743
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:39,703
但是她知道
But she knew,

744
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:42,248
她知道
she knew,

745
00:41:42,324 --> 00:41:44,161
她知道我
she knew I,

746
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:47,678
我想到我泥地里的脚印
I thought more about my footprint in the mud

747
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,459
多于想到她的身体和灵魂
than I did of her body and soul.

748
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,721
做梦也没想到啊
Where would I have dreamt it?

749
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:10,970
在拒绝了Sarah的殷勤之后
And after he had rejected Sarah's advances.

750
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,598
我一个字也没对Mary说
I never said a word to Mary

751
00:42:14,672 --> 00:42:17,482
我想这会让她难过
for I thought it would grieve her.

752
00:42:17,562 --> 00:42:21,073
然后我发现Mary开始变了
Then I began to see a change in Mary herself.

753
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,546
我妻子一向
My wife had always been

754
00:42:23,622 --> 00:42:27,133
善解人意
sort of understanding.

755
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:32,179
现在她对一切都怀疑
Now she's suspicious of everything I did.

756
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:35,483
我们开始无谓的争吵
We began to row about nothing,

757
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:38,067
完全没有原因
nothing at all.

758
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:41,132
这让我发狂
It maddened me.

759
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:43,285
事实也是如此吗?
And this was said as well?

760
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:46,573
是的 不是我瞎想
Aye, I didn't say it then mind,

761
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,398
我只是看到一切都不对了
I just saw it all go wrong.

762
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:59,084
她和Mary形影不离
She and Mary were inseparable and then,

763
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:05,465
后来我开了戒 又开始酗酒
well then I broke my blue ribbon

764
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:06,093
and begun drinking again

765
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:09,437
所以Mary有理由讨厌我了
so Mary had some reason

766
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:13,132
to be disgusted with me now.

767
00:43:12,998 --> 00:43:16,854
然后这个Fairbairn就插进来了
And then this Fairbairn fellow chipped in.

768
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:21,941
他是个时髦浮华的小伙子
He was a dashing, swaggering sort of a chap,

769
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:23,225
聪明 长着一头卷发
smart and curled,

770
00:43:23,305 --> 00:43:24,037
还受过教育
educated too,

771
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:26,413
我认为他很健谈
I reckon he could talk, he could.

772
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:30,096
是一件小事
But I know it was,

773
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:36,240
使我产生了疑虑
it was a little thing put me on to em.

774
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:40,327
我那天偶尔来到客厅
I came into the parlor unexpected one day

775
00:43:40,402 --> 00:43:41,860
一进门
and as I came in

776
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:44,888
我看见我妻子眼睛里闪过欢迎的光
I saw the light of welcome in me wife's eyes

777
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:50,598
但当她发现是我时
but when she saw it was me

778
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:56,474
她带着失望的表情转身就走了
she turned away with a look of disappointment.

779
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:58,574
肯定是把我当成Alec Fairbairn了
There was no one but Alec Fairbairn

780
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:00,306
不会是别人
whose steps you can mistake from mine.

781
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:04,696
从那一刻起我的平静就一去不复返了
I tell you from that moment on my peace was gone.

782
00:44:04,778 --> 00:44:06,236
Sarah当时在厨房
Sarah was in the kitchen

783
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:08,705
我直接走进厨房 告诉她
and I went straight through, and I told her

784
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:16,402
如果Fairbairn再出现在我家
that if Fairbairn ever set foot in my place again

785
00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:20,121
我就把他的耳朵留给你做纪念
I'd send her his ears for a keepsake.

786
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:29,097
我希望你是在法国犯下这个案子
I believe I could wish you had

787
00:44:25,844 --> 00:44:31,124
committed this deed of yours in France.

788
00:44:30,998 --> 00:44:35,141
他们承认冲动犯罪
They acknowledge the crime of passion there.

789
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:41,081
你不会让他们把我单独留在这
You won't let them leave me alone,

790
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:42,870
是吗 先生
will you, sir?

791
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,343
不
No,

792
00:44:46,911 --> 00:44:48,574
我不会
I won't.

793
00:44:51,196 --> 00:44:53,931
我走的时候会叫个警官进来
When I leave I'll send an officer in.

794
00:44:55,756 --> 00:44:58,138
我不想一个人
I don't like to be alone, see.

795
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:50,411
到你了
Your turn.

796
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,987
(knock on door)

797
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,709
我去去就来
Won't be a minute.

798
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:25,444
她让事情变糟的 是吗
She made it go wrong, didn't she?

799
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:32,478
你心里从来都只有我
And you never thought of anyone but me,

800
00:47:32,555 --> 00:47:34,701
是吗 Jim?
did you, Jim?

801
00:47:36,804 --> 00:47:37,584
她爱你
She loved you

802
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:39,968
她让我恨你
and she made me hate you.

803
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:55,605
看起来似乎她有什么秘密
There, it was as if she had a secret you see,

804
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:59,261
她让我往最坏处想
she made me think the worst.

805
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:03,496
这个秘密就是她爱我?
The secret was her loving me?

806
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,979
你该让她远离我们的生活 Jim
You should've got rid of her from our lives, Jim.

807
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:12,449
我知道
I know,

808
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:14,133
我知道那会伤害你
I thought it would hurt you.

809
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:20,038
看看我们现在
Look at us now,

810
00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:22,290
我真傻
I was stupid,

811
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:24,976
真是瞎了眼
blind as a beetle.

812
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:14,728
这是什么意思 华生
What is the meaning of it, Watson?

813
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:19,266
这一连串的...
What is the object of this

814
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:25,327
痛苦 暴力和恐惧究竟是为了什么
circle of misery, and violence, and fear?

815
00:51:25,406 --> 00:51:28,467
一定有某种目的
It must have a purpose,

816
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:30,015
不然我们这个宇宙就毫无意义
or our universe has no meaning

817
00:51:30,056 --> 00:51:31,991
而这是无法想象的
and that is unthinkable.

818
00:51:32,029 --> 00:51:33,850
但是是什么目的呢
But what purpose?

819
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:42,941
这是人类的大问题
That is humanity's great problem

820
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:46,696
思索了多少年
for which reasons so far

821
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,257
也没有答案
there's no answer.

822
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:55,591
