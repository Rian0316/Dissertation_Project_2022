...早在耶稣出生之前
...long, long before Jesus was born.

6
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:56,398
那真的是迷失的世界 就在巴西
It is truly the lost world and it's in Brazil.

7
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:21,934
那是你们妈妈的祖国 也是你们的国家
Your mamma's homeland and your country, too.

8
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,191
永远不要让自己
Never allow yourself

9
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:21,798
爱一个人爱得太深 Bates先生
to love someone too deeply Mr. Bates.

10
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:24,268
那会毁了你的
It will destroy you.

11
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:38,481
你到底还是来了
So you've come.

<font color="#ffff00">The Prbolem of Thor Bridge</font>

13
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,740
你接了一件案子 福尔摩斯
You have a case Holmes.

14
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:22,780
哈 你肯定是传染上了我的观察力
Ha, your faculty of observation is certainly contagious.

15
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,846
它使你马上能够洞悉我的秘密
It has enabled you at once to probe my secret.

16
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,580
是的 我接了一个案子
Yes, I have a case

17
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:31,032
在一个月的琐事和业务萧条之后
after a month of trivialities and stagnation

18
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:34,444
现在车轮终于又动起来了
the wheels move once more.

19
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:36,254
我可以听听吗?
Might I share it?

20
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:37,236
几乎没什么可说的
There's little to share.

21
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:40,144
等你吃了那两个煮老的鸡蛋后 我们再讨论吧
We will discuss it after you consume those two hard-boiled eggs,

22
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:43,461
它们可是我们的临时厨师 优待我们的哦
which our temporary cook has favored us.

23
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,345
这两个鸡蛋的状况
Their condition may not unconnected

24
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,955
应该是跟一期<家庭先驱>有关
with a copy of the Family Herald

25
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:52,909
我昨天看到这本杂志 就在在门厅的桌子上
which I observed yesterday on the hall table.

26
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:55,234
即使是煮蛋这样的小事
Even so trivial a matter as them cooking an egg

27
00:05:55,347 --> 00:05:57,045
也是需要用心的
demands an attention,

28
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,272
这与那本出色的期刊上的爱情传奇
which is incompatible with a love romance

29
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:02,759
是相互矛盾的
in that excellent periodical.

30
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,206
希望Hudson太太的假期过得愉快
I hope Mrs. Hudson is enjoying her holiday.

31
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:11,780
你应该听说过Neil Gibson
You've heard of Neil Gibson,

32
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,587
那个金矿之王
the gold king.

33
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:15,195
你说的是那个美国参议员?
You mean the America senator?

34
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:17,938
呃 他是西部某个州的参议员
Well he was senator of some western state.

35
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:19,608
他更为人知的身份是
He's better known as

36
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,600
世界上最伟大的金矿巨头
the greatest gold mining magnet in the world.

37
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,063
是的 我知道这个人
Yes, I know of him.

38
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,048
在英格兰呆了一段时间了吧?
Stayed in England for some time, didn't he?

39
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,689
大约五年前 他在Hampshire
He bought a considerable estate

40
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:28,528
买了一座相当大的房子
in Hampshire some five years ago.

41
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,622
你也许听说了他妻子的惨死吧
You may have heard of the tragic death of his wife.

42
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,676
哦 怪不得名字听上去那么熟
Oh, that's why the name is familiar.

43
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:34,245
我不清楚详情
I know nothing of the details.

44
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:38,726
事实是 这起案件虽然极其轰动
The fact is that the case, although exceedingly sensational

45
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:40,105
最后却没有什么难办的
appears to present no difficulty.

46
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:42,645
被告Grace Dunbar小姐的个性
The interesting personality of the accused

47
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:43,670
虽然有趣
Miss Grace Dunbar

48
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,379
却也无法掩盖清晰的证据
does not obscure the clearness of the evidence.

49
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,175
它们已经被验尸聆讯的陪审团所采信
That is if your taken by the coroner's jury

50
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,969
进入警方的法庭诉讼阶段
and also in the police court proceedings.

51
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:55,379
这是吃力不讨好的差事 华生
It is a thankless business Watson.

52
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:58,163
我能够发现事实 但我改变不了事实
I can discover facts, but I cannot change them.

53
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:01,100
除非出现新的完全出乎意料的事实
Unless some new and entirely unexpected ones come to light

54
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,528
否则我不知道我的委托人 还有什么好期待的
I do not see what my client can hope for.

55
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:04,861
你的委托人?
Your client?

56
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:10,008
我快要染上你那种 对故事进行倒叙的习惯了
I'm falling into your involved habit of telling a story back...

57
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:13,902
我不信这个
I don't believe this.

58
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,167
你得先把它读一读
You must read this first.

59
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,110
亲爱的歇洛克 福尔摩斯先生
<i>Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,</i>

60
00:07:24,223 --> 00:07:27,142
我不能眼睁睁地看着
<i>I cannot see the best woman God ever made</i>

61
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:29,400
上帝所创造的最好的女士步向死亡
<i>go to her death without doing all</i>

62
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,629
而不尽我所能去拯救她
<i>that is possible to save her.</i>

63
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,205
我无法解释
<i>I can't explain things.</i>

64
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:34,902
甚至连尝试去解释都做不到
<i>I can't even try to explain them</i>

65
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,274
但是我知道
<i>but I know beyond all doubt</i>

66
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:40,544
Dunbar小姐毫无疑问是无辜的
<i>that Miss. Dunbar is innocent.</i>

67
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,049
您了解事实
<i>You know the facts.</i>

68
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:43,366
谁又不了解呢?
<i>Who doesn't?</i>

69
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:45,321
这已经成了全国上下 茶余饭后的谈资了
<i>It has been the gossip of the country</i>

70
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,865
却没有一个声音为她说话
<i>and never a voice raised for her.</i>

71
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:49,671
最让我发狂的
<i>It's the damned injustice of it all</i>

72
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:52,324
就是这种该死的不公平
<i>that makes me crazy.</i>

73
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,676
那位女士心地善良
<i>That woman has a heart</i>

74
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,080
连苍蝇都不忍心打死
<i>that wouldn't let her kill a fly.</i>

75
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:58,210
也许我手中握有 连我自己都没有发觉的线索
<i>Maybe I have a clue and don't know it.</i>

76
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:02,034
不管怎么说 只要您能救她
<i>Anyway, all I know and all I have and all I am</i>

77
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,520
我的所知所有连同我这个人 都将听候您的差遣
<i>are for your use if only you can save her.</i>

78
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,540
你没时间细读所有这些剪报的内容
You hardly have time to master all these cuttings

79
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:09,593
所以要是你感兴趣的话
so I must give it to you in a lecture

80
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,239
我可以把此事的来龙去脉
if you're going to take an intelligent interest

81
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:13,229
给你详细地说一说
in the proceedings.

82
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:15,857
Gibson先生 据我所知
Mr. Gibson, as I understand is a man

83
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,006
娶了一位巴西太太
who married a Brazilian wife,

84
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:18,134
对于他的太太我完全不了解
and for who I know nothing

85
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,178
除了知道她青春已逝
except that she was past her prime,

86
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:21,978
甚为不幸
which was all the more unfortunate.

87
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:24,180
她请了一位很有魅力的家庭女教师
She has a very attractive governess

88
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:26,101
负责两个小孩的教育
who superintended the education of two children.

89
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:27,742
这是涉及此事的三个人
These are the three people concerned.

90
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,956
背景就是那所古老的庄园豪宅
The scene is the grand old manor house.

91
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,135
至于这起悲剧嘛...
As to the tragedy,

92
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,583
就发生在湖上的一座桥上
it takes place across a bridge over the lake

93
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:39,722
在宅子半英里外
half mile from the house.

94
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,464
一个猎场看守人夜里在桥上
The wife was found late at night by a gamekeeper

95
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,633
发现了这位太太
on that bridge.

96
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,374
她身着晚宴礼服
She was clad in her dinner dress

97
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:52,122
脑袋被一颗左轮手枪子弹打穿了
and a revolver bullet through her brain.

98
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:54,173
尸体附近没有找到凶器
No weapon was found near her

99
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:58,805
当地找不到任何与谋杀有关的线索
and there was no local clue as to her murder.

100
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,807
她附近找不到任何凶器的线索 华生
No weapon near her mark that Watson.

101
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,865
我说的是不是太简要了? 你能不能听得明白?
Is this too condensed, or can you follow it clearly?

102
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:06,812
可以的 很清楚
No, no, it's all very clear

103
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:09,701
但是为什么要怀疑家庭女教师呢?
but why suspect the governess?

104
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:12,160
呃...首先 有一些非常直接的证据
Well, in the first place there was some very direct evidence.

105
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:15,235
死去的女士身上有一张
The dead woman had a note upon her

106
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:18,961
家庭女教师署名的便条
making an appointment at the bridge.

107
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:21,784
约死者在桥上见面
And signed by the governess.

108
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,686
Gibson先生派他的农庄总管去找警察
Mr. Gibson sent his farm manager for the police

109
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,524
自己留守在尸体边
and stayed with the body

110
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,297
他要求不得移动现场的任何东西
insisting that nothing should be removed

111
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:34,993
直到警察在11点过后到达
until the police arrived just after 11:00.

112
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:38,742
然后发现了凶器...
Then there is the evidence of the revolver

113
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,447
一把发射过子弹的左轮手枪
with one discharged chamber.

114
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:41,882
Dunbar小姐
Miss. Dunbar.

115
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:43,309
而且手枪的口径
And a caliber

116
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:45,047
与子弹吻合
which corresponded with the bullet.

117
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,660
是的 我在这上面读到了
Yes, I see it here.

118
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:50,176
是在她衣柜的抽屉里发现的
It was found in the drawer of her wardrobe.

119
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,069
她衣柜的抽屉里
In the drawer of her wardrobe.

120
00:09:57,177 --> 00:09:58,457
相当具有毁灭性的证据
That's pretty damning.

121
00:09:58,571 --> 00:10:00,025
两个陪审团也是这么想的
So the two juries thought.

122
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:03,887
案件现在提交到了Winchester巡回审判庭
It is now referred to the Assizes at Winchester.

123
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,293
动机呢?
And the motive?

124
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:11,835
Gibson先生是一位很有魅力的男士
Mr. Gibson is a very attractive man.

125
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,817
如果他妻子死了
If his wife dies

126
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,353
谁能比那位年轻女士
who more likely to succeed her

127
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:17,032
更有可能当她的继任者呢?
than the young lady who had already

128
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,627
据大家所说
by all accounts received

129
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,462
她的雇主可是对她十分殷勤啊
pressing attentions from her employer.

130
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:24,330
爱情 财富 权力
Love, fortune, power,

131
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:28,375
全都取决于一位中年男士
all depending upon one middle-aged man,

132
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:33,045
用心险恶 华生 十分险恶
ugly Watson, very ugly.

133
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:35,027
而且她无法给出不在场的证明
Nor could she prove an alibi.

134
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:36,131
相反的 她不得不承认
On the contrary, she had to admit

135
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,032
她当晚九点的确上了桥
that she was down to the bridge by 9:00.

136
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:41,849
有个仆人看见她匆匆往那儿赶去
A servant had seen her hurrying there.

137
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:45,263
似乎结局已经注定了
Well, it really does seem final.

138
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:48,603
然而...华生
And yet Watson,

139
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,823
然而...
and yet.

140
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:53,419
如果我没搞错的话
Unless I'm mistaken that is our client

141
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,434
应该是我们的委托人提早到了
considerably before his time.

142
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:56,665
有位先生要见您 先生
Gentleman to see you, sir.

143
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:57,831
Neil Gibson先生吗?
Mr. Neil Gibson?

144
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,851
不 先生 不是他
No, sir, not him.

145
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:00,200
是一位叫Bates的先生
His name is Bates

146
00:11:00,237 --> 00:11:02,320
看上去有些恼怒
and he looks a bit aggravated.

147
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,621
谢谢 Billy
Thank you, Billy.

148
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:08,627
我的时间不多 Bates先生
I have only a short time, Mr. Bates.

149
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:09,949
我知道Gibson先生就快到了
I know Mr. Gibson is coming.

150
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:12,184
我是他庄园的总管
I am manager of his estate.

151
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:13,961
福尔摩斯先生 他是个恶棍!
Mr. Holmes, he's a villain,

152
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,460
一个可恨的恶棍
an infernal villain.

153
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,267
措辞很强烈啊 Bates先生
Strong words Mr. Bates.

154
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:18,634
呃 我不得不加重语气 福尔摩斯先生
Well, I have to be emphatic Mr. Holmes.

155
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:19,462
时间有限
The time is so limited.

156
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:21,024
我恰好不想让他发现我在这儿
I'll not have him find me here for the world.

157
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:22,304
而你是他的总管
And you're his manager.

158
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:23,780
噢 我已经告知他了
Oh, I've given him notice.

159
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:27,383
再过几周 我就将摆脱他那该死的奴役
In a couple of weeks I shall have shaken off his cursed slavery.

160
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:29,220
他是个严苛的人 福尔摩斯先生
He's a hard man Mr. Holmes,

161
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,415
各方面都很严苛
hard to all about him.

162
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:32,551
不过他的妻子是他的主要受害者
But his wife was his chief victim.

163
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:33,970
他对她非常残忍
He was brutal to her.

164
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:36,189
噢 是的 先生 十分残忍
Oh, yes, sir, brutal.

165
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,078
我不知道她是怎么死的
Now how she come by her death I do not know,

166
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,914
不过他让她的生活痛苦不堪
but let me tell you he made her life a misery.

167
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:43,648
她是一个来自热带的人
She was a creature of the tropics,

168
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:46,161
你应该都知道了 她是个巴西人
a Brazilian by birth as you no doubt know.

169
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:48,318
是的 我知道 请接着说 接着说
Yes, I understand. Please continue, continue.

170
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:50,741
呃 具有热带的血统 热带的天性
Well tropical by birth, tropical by nature,

171
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,354
她是太阳的女儿 充满了热情
she was a child of the sun and of passion.

172
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:57,223
她全身心地爱他
She loved him as only such women can love.

173
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,237
我们都同情她
We all felt for her.

174
00:11:58,274 --> 00:12:01,223
憎恶他对待她的方式
Hated him for the way he treated her.

175
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,427
不过他总是花言巧语又狡诈多端
But he's plausible and cunning.

176
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,188
我要告诉你的就是这些
And that's all I have to tell you.

177
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,083
不要被他的表象迷惑了
Don't take him at face value.

178
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:08,753
在他的假面背后还有更多的东西
There is more behind.

179
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,555
现在我得走了
Now I'll go.

180
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:10,616
不 不要挽留我
No, please don't detain me.

181
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:12,321
他就要到了
He's almost due.

182
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:16,497
哇哇哇
Well, well, well.

183
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,185
Gibson先生有着很好的忠诚的一家
Mr. Gibson has a nice loyal household.

184
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,592
"很有价值"才是该用的字眼
Rewarding is a useful one.

185
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:52,885
Gibson先生 请直接上楼 先生
Mr. Gibson, straight upstairs, sir.

186
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:06,729
这是我的朋友和同事 华生医生
This is my friend and colleague Dr. Watson.

187
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,797
我在这儿明确声明 福尔摩斯先生
Let me say right here Mr. Holmes,

188
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:16,019
在这件事上你完全不用担心钱的问题
money is nothing to me in this business.

189
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:18,017
如果能对你发掘真相有所帮助
You can burn it if it's any use

190
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:19,125
你把钱烧了也没关系
enlightening you to the truth.

191
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:22,422
这位女士是无辜的 必须还她清白
This woman is innocent. This woman has to be cleared.

192
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:23,967
这事就靠你来做了
It's up to you to do it.

193
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:25,412
说说你的数目吧
Now name your figure.

194
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,356
我的职业收费有着固定的标准
My professional charges are at a fixed rate.

195
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,638
我通常不做改变
I do not vary them save

196
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,397
完全免费的情况除外
when I remit them altogether.

197
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:35,974
哦 如果金钱对你来说没有什么影响
Well, if money makes no difference to you

198
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:37,759
那就想想名声吧
think of the reputation.

199
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,020
如果你能澄清这个案子
If you pull this off every newspaper

200
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:42,621
英格兰和美国的每一份报纸 都会大肆宣传的
in England and America will be booming.

201
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,902
两个大陆的人们都会谈论你
You'll be the talk of two continents.

202
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:48,512
我觉得我不需要什么宣传 Gibson先生
I do not think I'm in need of booming Mr. Gibson.

203
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:52,591
让我们着眼事实吧
Please let us get down to the facts.

204
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,602
呃 大多数主要的事实
Well, you'll find most of the main ones

205
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,271
你都能在媒体的报道中看到
in the press reports.

206
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:57,157
我觉得也没什么好补充的了
I don't think I can add much to them,

207
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,569
不过如果还有你还有什么 需要进一步弄清的
but if there's anything you'd wish more light on,

208
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,014
我可以告诉你
well I'm here to give it.

209
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:01,881
只有一点
Well there is just one point.

210
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,724
是什么?
What is it?

211
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:07,408
你和Dunbar小姐确切的关系是什么?
What are your exact relations with Miss. Dunbar?

212
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,819
我想  福尔摩斯先生
I suppose you are within your rights,

213
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:17,221
问这样的问题 也许是你的权利和职责
maybe doing your duty in asking such a question Mr. Holmes.

214
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,656
的确如此
We will agree to suppose so.

215
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,025
那么我可以向你保证
Then I can assure you

216
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:25,846
我们的关系一直是而且完全是
that our relations were always and entirely

217
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:28,697
雇主与一位年轻女雇员的关系
those of an employer that awards a young lady

218
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,384
她和小孩相处的时间以外
whom he never conversed with or even saw

219
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:35,024
我从未跟她说过话甚至是见过她
save when she was in the company of his children.

220
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:47,857
我是个大忙人  Gibson先生
I'm rather a busy man Mr. Gibson.

221
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:52,354
对于毫无意义的谈话 我既无时间也无兴趣
I don't have time or taste for aimless conversations.

222
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,821
祝您早安
I wish you good morning.

223
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:59,391
你这样说到底什么意思 福尔摩斯先生?
What the devil do you mean by this Mr. Holmes?

224
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:00,895
你拒绝接受我的案子吗?
Do you dismiss my case?

225
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,223
不 Gibson先生 我拒绝接受的是你
No, Mr. Gibson, I dismiss you.

226
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:06,236
就算是没有这种虚假的信息
The case is quite sufficiently complicated

227
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:09,432
给我增添麻烦 案子本身就已经够复杂了
without the added difficulty of false information.

228
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:10,593
你的意思是我在撒谎喽?
Meaning that I lied?

229
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:14,264
我尽可能表达得委婉一些
I tried to express it as delicately as I could,

230
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,415
不过如果你坚持这样说
but if you insist upon the word

231
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:17,796
我也不否认
I will not contradict you.

232
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,323
别焦躁  Gibson先生
Don't be noisy Mr. Gibson.

233
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,240
我发现在用完早餐以后 任何争吵都是非常令人难受的
I find after breakfast any argument most unsettling.

234
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,402
我想在户外散一下步
I suggest a little stroll in the open air

235
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:27,477
再安静地做些思考
and some quiet thought

236
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:30,303
会对你非常有好处的
will be greatly to your advantage.

237
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,739
比你更强的人我都打败过 福尔摩斯先生
I've broken stronger men than you Mr. Holmes.

238
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:37,374
惹恼我的人从来不曾有过好下场
Nobody crosses me and gets the better of it.

239
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:41,980
许多人对我这样说过 可是我现在还好好地在这儿坐着
So many have said so yet here I am.

240
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:44,939
华生 他得学的事情还多着呢
Well, Watson he has a great deal yet to learn.

241
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,303
你到底是怎么知道 他和家庭女教师之间的关系的?
How on earth did you know about his relationship with the governess?

242
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,447
虚张声势的 华生 虚张声势
Bluff, Watson, bluff.

243
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:55,466
我觉得 他信里那种热切的非公事话的口吻
I considered the passionate and unbusinesslike tone of his letter

244
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:58,728
与他的举止和外表并不相符
contrasted with his manner and appearance.

245
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:01,386
显然他对那名被指控的女士
It was pretty clear there was some deep emotion

246
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:02,956
而不是死者
centered upon the accused woman

247
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:03,777
怀有深沉的感情
rather than the victim.

248
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:05,545
我于是对他虚张声势
I bluffed him by giving the impression

249
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,208
让他以为我对此已经完全清楚
that I was absolutely certain of it.

250
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:09,075
而事实上你只是有所怀疑罢了
When in reality you were only suspicious.

251
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:10,552
你觉得他还会回来吗?
Do you think he'll come back?

252
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,525
他肯定会回来的
He is sure to come back.

253
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,711
他非回来不可
He must come back.

254
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,720
噢 不不不 我亲爱的华生
Oh, no, no, my dear Watson

255
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:53,807
恐怕你在你的记录里
I fear you will not improve

256
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,419
再添上雷神桥之谜
any reputation I have acquired

257
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,328
对提高我的声名也没有什么帮助的
by adding the Thor Bridge mysteries,

258
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:02,946
我担心我做出了严重错误的判断
your annals I fear I made a serious misjudgment.

259
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,477
福尔摩斯 参议员也许是没有回来
Holmes, the senator may not have returned

260
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:09,044
但他的来信确定无疑
but surely his letter

261
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:12,773
是代表Dunbar小姐聘用了你
has engaged you on behalf of Miss. Dunbar.

262
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,040
她才是那个处在危难中的人
She's the one in need.

263
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,320
难道我们不去拜访她一下吗
Might we not pay her a visit?

264
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,406
去Winchester监狱?
In the cells of Winchester?

265
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:21,527
那需要得到官方的许可
That will require official permits.

266
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:24,713
呃 我们有办法可以申请到
Well we have the means to apply.

267
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:28,191
当然不是很符合职业道德的途径
Of course it may not be quite ethical.

268
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:32,064
但却很实用 华生 很实用
But practical Watson, practical.

269
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:34,422
我要祝贺你
I congratulate you.

270
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,912
你把我们的难题解决了吗 华生?
You solved our problem Watson?

271
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,158
某个多管闲事的小职员
Some officious little pip-squeak of a clerk

272
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,976
对我们的信和官方许可提出了质疑
queried both the letter and our home office permit.

273
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:10,579
他要求Gibson本人 亲自授权
He demanded a personal authorization from Gibson himself.

274
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:11,847
不过你还是解决了?
But you sorted it out?

275
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:13,114
幸好交了好运
Only by the good fortune

276
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:15,000
碰到了她的律师Cummings先生
of meeting her lawyer Mr. Cummings.

277
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:16,903
在他的担保下 我们可以听她做一次简短的陈述
He secured a brief audience with her.

278
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,637
Joyce Cummings先生
Mr. Joyce Cummings, a man with a rising reputation

279
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:21,990
他的声名鹊起当然是得益于她
that is certainly in her favor.

280
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,528
能在这里见到您真是上帝的恩赐 福尔摩斯先生
It really is providence to see you here Mr. Holmes.

281
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:45,396
她的案子两天后就要开庭了
Her trial is in two days

282
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:46,819
而我实在是智穷计尽
and I really am at my wits ends

283
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,679
找不到任何可以挽救她的证据
to find any evidence to save her.

284
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:51,618
她是否承认 写过便条并与Gibson太太见过面?
Did she admit to writing the note and keeping the rendezvous with Mrs. Gibson?

285
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:53,144
她别无选择啊
She has little choice.

286
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:54,420
不过除了这点以外
But beyond that I have advised her

287
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:56,426
-我还是建议她不要认罪 -没错
-to reserve her defense. -Quite so.

288
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:17,769
这位是歇洛克.福尔摩斯先生
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes

289
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,303
还有他的同事华生医生
and his colleague Dr. Watson.

290
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,597
你的雇主Gibson先生聘请我
Your employer Mr. Gibson has engaged me

291
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:25,524
来调查这起令人不快的事件
to look into this unhappy matter.

292
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:29,053
噢 对Gibson先生我非常感激
Oh, I'm very grateful to Mr. Gibson.

293
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:31,504
对我的指控维持不变
It is incredible that the charge against me

294
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,745
真是难以置信
has been sustained.

295
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:34,686
我还以为在初级法庭上
I thought the whole thing would clear itself up

296
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,873
整件事情就可以得到澄清了呢
in the police court.

297
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:40,161
亲爱的小姐 我请你不要存在任何幻想
My dear, dear I beg of you to have no illusions.

298
00:19:40,198 --> 00:19:42,225
Cummings先生会向你表明
Mr. Cummings here will assure you

299
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:44,760
现在所有的证据都是对你不利的
all the cards at present are against you.

300
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:46,855
Gibson先生相信你的清白
Mr. Gibson is convinced of your innocence

301
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:48,576
但如果假装说你的处境不是十分危险
but it would be a cruel deception to pretend

302
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:51,506
那将是对你的残忍欺骗
that you're not in very great danger.

303
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:54,007
我会实话实说的
I will conceal nothing.

304
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:56,287
你和Gibson先生的妻子之间
What were the true relations between you

305
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,848
真正的关系如何?
and Mr. Gibson's wife?

306
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,277
许可...什么许可?
Permit... what permit?

307
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:05,741
你怎么敢如此造次 福尔摩斯先生?
How dare you take this liberty Mr. Holmes?

308
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:06,641
Gibson先生
Mr. Gibson.

309
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,802
还有你 Cummings
And you Cummings,

310
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,742
我雇佣你不是要你来联合对我耍阴谋的
I did not engage you sir to conspire against me.

311
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,714
这些人说得了我的许可 完全是捏造
These men are here under false pretenses.

312
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:15,349
我并没有授权让他们进行这次探访
I did not authorize their visit.

313
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:16,291
他们都是些骗子
They're deceivers.

314
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,694
我要求他们立即离开
I demand their removal at once.

315
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,919
Gibson先生 你心智不清
You have made a disturbance Mr. Gibson,

316
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:23,994
可以进疯人院了
worthy of bedlam.

317
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:27,067
说这话我非让人把你碾碎不可 福尔摩斯
I'll have you crushed for this Holmes.

318
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,708
是嘛 这对你可没什么好处
Well it'll profit you nothing.

319
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:29,504
Holmes先生
Mr. Holmes.

320
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,477
我们要走了 警官
We are leaving superintendent.

321
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:34,187
Cummings先生
Mr. Cummings.

322
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:36,889
暂时就到这吧 Dunbar小姐
For the moment Miss. Dunbar.

323
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,423
你必须信任歇洛克.福尔摩斯
You must put your faith in Sherlock Holmes.

324
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,193
你是...?
Mr?

325
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,701
Ferguson
Ferguson.

326
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:55,165
街对面的博物馆
There is an excellent exhibition

327
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:56,530
正举行非常精彩的展览
at the museum across the street.

328
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:58,433
我郑重向你推荐
I recommend it to you.

329
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:09,188
- 博物馆五点钟关门 - 这次起诉 警官先生 完全是误会
The museum closes at 5:00.

330
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:24,944
1578年做气泡玻璃的工人
The copy of the lease

331
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:30,435
所签订的契约
of the buck-boat glass workers dated 1578.

332
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:34,913
这些法国人 是你的什么亲戚吗?
These Huguenots, are they any relations of yours?

333
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,965
也许吧
Possibly.

334
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:41,790
Potel先生 和Leve Stoke城的造纸
Monsieur Potel and this paper making of laver stoke.

335
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:44,233
他们做钞票的历史
They've had the manufacture of bank notes

336
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:46,051
已经有一百多年了
for over 100 years.

337
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:46,802
是嘛 很高兴得知
Well it's good to know

338
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,437
在你家某个地方还有些钱
there's money somewhere in your family.

339
00:21:58,145 --> 00:22:00,334
下午好 Ferguson先生
Good afternoon Mr. Ferguson.

340
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:03,627
Neil Gibson先生想见你
Mr. Neil Gibson wishes to see you

341
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:06,537
时间是明早11点 在雷神宅邸
at Thor Place at 11:00 tomorrow morning.

342
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,548
今晚可能更方便些
This evening will be more convenient.

343
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:12,084
早上11点 福尔摩斯先生
The morning, 11:00 Mr. Holmes.

344
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:15,892
会不会派汽车来接我们?
Will a motor be sent for us?

345
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,479
有趟火车 可以直接带你们到雷神村
There is a train which will take you to Thor Village.

346
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:21,380
Gibson先生是个忙碌的人
Mr. Gibson is a busy man.

347
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,253
他希望你能准时到达
He expects punctuality.

348
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,286
-你怎么知道他的态度会有转变? -我赌了一把
-How did you know that he was going to turn? -I gambled,

349
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:33,613
Dunbar小姐脸上的表情
there's been enough of an impression

350
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,383
可以替我们赢得好感
upon Ms. Dunbar to turn us back into favor.

351
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,918
我们毕竟是她唯一的希望
We are after all her only hope.

352
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:42,097
华生 现在我们得找家舒适的旅馆 来度过这一晚
Now Watson we must find a comfortable inn for the night

353
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:44,883
这样我们才能在明早9点
so that we can arrive punctually at Thor Place

354
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:46,205
准时到达雷神宅邸
at 9:00 in the morning.

355
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:47,488
我以为他说的是11点
I thought he said 11:00.

356
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:49,399
9点 华生
9:00 Watson

357
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:51,556
我们去见当地警局的Coventry警官
to meet Sergeant Coventry of the local police.

358
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:55,546
任何情况下 福尔摩斯先生
In all events Mr. Holmes

359
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:58,034
我更乐意是您而不是苏格兰场来
I'd rather have you than Scotland Yard.

360
00:22:58,071 --> 00:22:59,653
如果苏格兰场插手一件案子
If the Yard gets called into a case,

361
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:01,331
案子破了当地的警方也得不到任何功劳
the local loses all credit for success

362
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:03,375
要是破不了也许就得背黑锅
and may be blamed for failure.

363
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:05,818
我听说您就不会玩花样
Now you play it straight so I've heard.

364
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:08,125
这件事我根本不必出面
I need not appear in the matter at all.

365
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:10,037
您真是太大度了
That's very handsome of you.

366
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:14,039
而我知道您的朋友华生医生也值得信任
And your friend Dr. Watson can be trusted I know.

367
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:17,033
我有个问题要问你
Now there is one question I'd like to ask you

368
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,803
不过我只问您一个人
but I breath it to no soul but you.

369
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:21,422
您觉不觉得
Don't you think there might be a case

370
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:24,602
也许案子对Neil Gibson先生本人不利?
against Mr. Neil Gibson himself?

371
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,944
就仆人们所说
According to the servants

372
00:23:25,982 --> 00:23:28,421
他吃完晚餐就进了书房
he retired to his study after dinner

373
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,514
在11点来警报之前
and had no company at all

374
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:33,770
根本就没人陪伴
until the alarm at 11:00.

375
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:35,955
是的 我考虑过Gibson先生
Yes I've been considering Mr. Gibson.

376
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:39,978
这些美国人比起我们这里的人 更热衷于用手枪
These Americans are readier with their pistols than our folk are.

377
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:41,209
那就是他的手枪 你知道吧
It was his pistol, you know.

378
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,645
一对中的一把
One of a pair he had.

379
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:45,004
一对中的一把?
One of a pair?

380
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:46,695
另一把在哪里?
Where is the other?

381
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,312
这些先生们总是有
Well these gentlemen have all kinds of firearms

382
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:49,648
这样那样的各式各样的武器
of one sort or another.

383
00:23:49,686 --> 00:23:51,699
我们没有真正比对过那把特殊的手枪
We never quite matched that particular pistol.

384
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:53,903
盒子是根据一对手枪定造的
The box was made for two.

385
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,330
这就是尸体所在的地方
Now, this is where the body lay.

386
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,725
我从报上读到
I gathered from the press reports

387
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:00,685
子弹是近距离发射的
that the shot was fired at close quarters.

388
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:01,718
距离非常近 先生
Very close sir.

389
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:02,544
就在右侧太阳穴附近?
Near the right temple?

390
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:03,309
右侧太阳穴往后一点 先生
Just behind it, sir.

391
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:04,918
尸体的姿势如何?
How did the body lie?

392
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,053
仰面躺下 先生
On the back, sir.

393
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,739
没有搏斗的痕迹 没有脚印 没有凶器
No trace of a struggle, no mark, no weapons.

394
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,691
她的左手攥着
The short note from Ms. Dunbar

395
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:11,933
Dunbar小姐写的短笺
was clutched in her left hand.

396
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:13,137
攥着?
Clutched?

397
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:14,255
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

398
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:16,052
我们几乎都没法掰开她的手指
We could hardly open her fingers.

399
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:18,179
这是最重要的一点
That is of the greatest importance.

400
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:19,421
这一点排除了一种说法
It excludes the idea

401
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,890
就是有人在她死后把便条放到她手里
that anybody could have placed it there

402
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,934
以制造假证据
after death to furnish a false clue.

403
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:26,165
但是天哪
But dear me,

404
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:30,879
我记得便条写得十分简短
the note as I remember was quite short.

405
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:35,099
是的 "9点到雷神桥 G. Dunbar"
Yes, be at Thor Bridge 9:00 G. Dunbar,

406
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:35,954
是不是那样写的?
wasn't that it?

407
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,113
的确如此 先生
So it was, sir.

408
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:40,655
便条意思模糊 不是吗?
The point of the note is obscured, is it not.

409
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:43,023
呃 先生 我这样说也许有些鲁莽
Well, sir, it seemed if I may be bold as to say so

410
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,192
这可是整个案件中唯一真正清晰的一点啊
the only real clear point in the whole case.

411
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:47,464
假设便条不是伪造的
Assuming the note is genuine.

412
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:50,243
她肯定是之前的某个时间收到的
She certainly received it some time before,

413
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,010
比方说一两个钟头之前
say an hour or two.

414
00:24:52,048 --> 00:24:54,882
那么她为什么还把它握在左手上呢?
Why was she then clasping it in the left hand?

415
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,192
在会面过程中她不必再参考其内容
She had no need to refer to it in the interview.

416
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,486
这一点看上去不是很值得注意吗?
Does that not seem remarkable?

417
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:05,840
呃 先生 正如你所说的 也许是值得关注
Well sir, as you put it, perhaps it does.

418
00:25:09,565 --> 00:25:11,537
那个很古怪啊
That is curious.

419
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:13,338
噢 是的 先生 我们注意到了
Oh, yes, sir, we noticed that.

420
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:17,111
我觉得是某个过路人干的
I expect it's been done by some passer-by.

421
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:19,661
干这个需要下手很重
Took some violence to do that.

422
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:23,298
这不是来自上方的猛烈撞击 而是来自底下
It was a hard knock not from above, but below.

423
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,983
你看见栏杆的底端了吗 华生?
You see some lower end of the parapet Watson?

424
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:29,270
是的 和尸体所在位置
Yes and in a direct line

425
00:25:29,307 --> 00:25:31,651
刚好成一直线
with the position of the body.

426
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:34,013
也许无关紧要
It's probably of no matter.

427
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,366
你说过没有脚印?
No footprints you say.

428
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:39,577
是的 地面如钢铁般坚硬 先生
The ground was iron hard sir.

429
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:40,677
完全没有足迹
No marks at all.

430
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:42,899
那我们在这里也没有什么需要知道的了
Then we have nothing more to learn here.

431
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,914
你来早了 福尔摩斯先生
You are early Mr. Holmes.

432
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:01,486
准时的情况通常就是如此  Ferguson先生
It is often the case with punctuality Mr. Ferguson.

433
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:03,270
Gibson先生在开会
Mr. Gibson is in a meeting.

434
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:05,416
他还不能见你
He is not ready to see you.

435
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:08,141
我来招待他们 Ferguson
I'll take care of them Ferguson.

436
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:18,145
很高兴见到你们 先生们
I'm very glad to see you gentlemen.

437
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:20,287
既然我们来早了一点
As we are a little early

438
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:22,807
也许我们可以看看枪火室?
perhaps we can see the gun room?

439
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,224
一个树敌不少的人
A man who has his enemies.

440
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:55,870
噢 是的 要是你们了解他的为人和处事
Oh, yes if you knew him and his methods.

441
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,250
他睡觉时还把一把上了膛的左轮手枪
He sleeps with a loaded revolver

442
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:58,625
放在他的床头柜里
in a drawer by his bed.

443
00:26:58,661 --> 00:27:00,275
他是一个很暴力的人 先生
He's a man of violence, sir.

444
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:02,570
你有没有见到过他殴打他的妻子?
Have you ever seen him strike his wife?

445
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:04,864
是的 不只一次
Yes, more than once.

446
00:27:05,814 --> 00:27:09,595
我们的金矿之王的私生活 可不像金子那么熠熠生辉啊
Our gold king does not seem to shine in private life.

447
00:27:09,632 --> 00:27:11,722
福尔摩斯 这里
Holmes, here.

448
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,803
这就是装凶器的盒子
That's the box that contained the murder weapon.

449
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,121
一对中的一把
It was one of a pair.

450
00:27:15,158 --> 00:27:17,101
另外一把失踪了
The other is missing.

451
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,230
Ferguson先生肯定知道
Mr. Ferguson is sure to know

452
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:21,560
你在陪同我们
that your consorting with us

453
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:24,239
对此你不担忧吗?
does that hold no alarm for you?

454
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:26,641
现在他伤害不了我的
There's nothing he can do to hurt me now.

455
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,123
那麻烦你带我们去学习室好吗?
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to show us the schoolroom?

456
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:35,256
孩子们在哪里?
Where are the children?

457
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:39,180
送去美国了
Sent away on a visit to America.

458
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:47,045
一目了然啊
(unintelligible)

459
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:51,991
他们从母亲那遗传了巴西人的特点
Their Brazilian heritage from their mother's side.

460
00:27:52,028 --> 00:27:54,975
Dunbar小姐应该是个不错的老师
Miss. Dunbar must seem to be a remarkable teacher.

461
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:57,015
孩子们非常爱她
The children doted on her.

462
00:27:58,419 --> 00:27:59,717
瞧见了吧 华生
See Watson,

463
00:27:59,754 --> 00:28:02,394
Ricardo Franco丘陵
the Ricardo Franco Hills.

464
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,971
看看这些无法攀登的悬崖
See the unscaleable cliffs

465
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,350
从未留下过时间和人类的足迹
which time and the foot of man have never touched,

466
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:08,491
开天辟地时留下的怪兽
where monsters from the dawn of history

467
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,466
也许还在山崖间徘徊
might still roam.

468
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:12,852
那是Martins 一位印第安猎手
That's Martins, the Indian hunter.

469
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:15,342
我知道这个人
I know about him.

470
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:19,800
他的残害对象都是妇女和孩子 令人同情
His victims, women and children, pitiful.

471
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:22,921
你是不是说Maria Gibson
Would you say that Maria Gibson

472
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:23,781
嫉妒Dunbar小姐
was jealous of Miss. Dunbar

473
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,350
以及她对孩子们的影响?
and her influence over the children?

474
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:27,365
不 他们夫妇之间的爱依然存在
No, there was no love lost between them.

475
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,835
但那是因为她看出
But that was because she could see her husband

476
00:28:29,872 --> 00:28:31,090
她的丈夫也中了那位女士的魔咒了
was under the lady's spell too.

477
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,263
从这滚出去 Bates
Get out of here Bates.

478
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:43,433
Bates先生的看法与此事无关 福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Bates's views are not relevant Mr. Holmes.

479
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,310
他对我已故妻子的迷恋 导致他歪曲了事实
They're distorted by his infatuation for my late wife.

480
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:47,851
谁知道呢 Gibson先生
Who knows, Mr. Gibson,

481
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:49,865
哪些是有关的哪些又是无关的呢
what is and what is not relevant.

482
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,874
你活像是位外科医生
You're like a surgeon who wants every symptom

483
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:56,301
在做出诊断前总要问清每一个症状
before he could give a diagnosis.

484
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:58,094
因为每一个病人都有着自己的理由
As any a patient has reason in deceiving

485
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:02,704
要去欺骗他的医生 隐瞒事实
his surgeon who conceals the facts.

486
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,815
我可以向你保证
I can assure you

487
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:07,859
我和Dunbar小姐之间的关系
that the relations between Miss. Dunbar and myself

488
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:10,245
与此案无关
do not touch this case.

489
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,063
我想这个该由我自己来判断
I'm sure that is for me to decide.

490
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:17,332
大多数男人在他们心灵的某个角落里
Most men have a little private reserve

491
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,883
总为自己保留着一块私人的空间
in some corner of their souls

492
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,294
他们不希望他人去窥探这个空间
where they don't welcome intruders.

493
00:29:21,332 --> 00:29:23,791
你突然间侵入了我的这个空间
You burst suddenly into mine.

494
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,212
你到底想要什么?
What is it you want?

495
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,525
真相
The truth.

496
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:41,388
我在巴西掘金的时候遇到了我妻子
I met my wife when I was gold hunting in Brazil.

497
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:45,157
她是Manaos一位政府官员的女儿
She was the daughter of a government official in the Manaos.

498
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:49,611
即使是现在用我热情已逝的眼光来看
Even now as I look back with a colder eye

499
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:51,903
她还是有着一种热情奔放的
she had a rich passionate nature,

500
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:54,313
热带的 情绪不稳定的本性
tropical, ill-balanced,

501
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:57,849
与我所认识的美国女人有着很大的不同
very different from the American women I'd known.

502
00:29:58,294 --> 00:30:00,666
直到激情消逝
It was only when the romance had passed

503
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:02,400
我才开始意识到
that I realized we had nothing,

504
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:04,704
我们之间毫无共同之处
absolutely nothing in common.

505
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,907
我的爱渐渐淡去
My love faded

506
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:10,243
但你知道女人爱的方式
but you know the wonderful way of women.

507
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:15,157
不管我怎么做也不能让她不再爱我
Do what I might, nothing could turn her from me.

508
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:17,564
如果说我对她苛刻 甚至是残忍
If I'd been harsh to her, even brutal,

509
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:19,967
那是因为我知道
it was because I knew that if I could kill her love

510
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,685
如果我能让她不再爱我甚至恨我
or turn it to hate

511
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:23,888
那对我们两人来说都会好受些
it would be easier for us both.

512
00:30:23,926 --> 00:30:26,283
但是什么也改变不了她
But nothing changed her.

513
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,251
在这些英国的丛林中
She still adored me in these English woods

514
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,269
她对我的爱
as she had adored me 20 years before

515
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:33,722
一如20年前在亚马逊河畔
on the banks of the Amazon.

516
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,176
接着Dunbar小姐就出现了
Then came Miss. Dunbar.

517
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:38,420
她同样是位非常美丽的女士
She is also a very beautiful woman

518
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,480
我向你承认
and I'll admit to you that I could not live

519
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:42,857
生活在同一屋檐下每天接触她
under the same roof in daily contact with her

520
00:30:42,894 --> 00:30:45,910
不对她产生爱慕是不可能的
without feeling a passionate regard for her.

521
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:47,144
你能因此责怪我吗 福尔摩斯先生?
You blame me Mr. Holmes?

522
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,419
你有这样的情感我不会怪你
I don't blame you for feeling it.

523
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:50,070
我要怪你向她表达了你的感情
I should blame you for expressing it

524
00:30:50,108 --> 00:30:52,297
要知道她还是在你的庇护下的
since she was under your protection.

525
00:30:52,335 --> 00:30:53,116
噢 也许吧
Well maybe so.

526
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:56,044
我不会把我的本性说得比实际更好
I'm not pretending to be any better than I am.

527
00:30:56,082 --> 00:30:57,720
我想在我的一生中
I guess all of my life I've been a man

528
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,622
我要什么东西我都会伸手去争取
that's reached out his hand for what he wanted.

529
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,915
而这个女人以及她的爱
And I never wanted anything more

530
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:04,825
是我最想得到的东西了
than the love and possession of that woman.

531
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,934
我就是这样告诉她的
I told her so.

532
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:08,003
是嘛?
You did, did you?

533
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,044
我说如果可以的话我会娶她
I said if I could I'd marry her,

534
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:12,773
不过这却不是我力所能及的事情
but it was out of my power.

535
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,717
钱不是问题
Money was no object.

536
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,969
我会尽我所能让她快乐
I'd do all I could to make her happy,

537
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:16,811
舒适
comfortable.

538
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,488
你非常慷慨
Very generous of you.

539
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:19,928
听着 福尔摩斯先生
Now see here Mr. Holmes

540
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,638
我是来找你是为了证据的问题 而不是道德的问题
I came to you on a question of evidence, not morals.

541
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:24,878
我不是要你来批评我
I'm not asking for criticism.

542
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:26,295
我只不过是看在那位女士的份上
It is only for the lady's sake

543
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,797
才接下这个案子
that I take on this case at all.

544
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:31,725
她所受到的指控
Nothing that she's accused of is worse

545
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:33,457
并不比你所承认的更坏
than what you yourself have admitted,

546
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:35,234
你说你试图去毁掉一个
that you've tried to ruin a defenseless girl

547
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,444
生活在你屋檐底下却毫无防备能力的女孩
who was under your roof.

548
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:38,856
也许有些像你这样的有钱人会反驳我
You know some of you rich men must retort

549
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:41,423
不过在这个世上并非一切对他人的冒犯
but all the world cannot be bribed

550
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:43,525
靠金钱的收买就能得到谅解
into condoning your offenses.

551
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:44,968
我自己也是这样想的
That's how I feel myself about it.

552
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:48,429
现在我要感谢上帝我的计划没能实现
Now I thank God my plans did not work out.

553
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:50,789
她完全不买我的帐
She'd have none it.

554
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:54,460
她想要马上离开这座房子
She wanted to leave the house instantly.

555
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:57,120
那她怎么还没走?
But why did she not?

556
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,824
还有别人得依靠她
Others were dependent upon her

557
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:01,250
对她来说
and it was no light matter for her

558
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,618
让他们失望可不是件小事
to let them down.

559
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:05,899
我向她发誓 再也不会骚扰她了
When I'd sworn that she should never be molested again.

560
00:32:05,936 --> 00:32:07,974
于是她同意留下来
She consented to stay.

561
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:12,194
不过还有另外一个原因
But there was another reason.

562
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,195
她知道她对我的影响力
She knew the influence that she had over me,

563
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,757
比世上任何其它的影响更为强烈
that it was stronger than any other influence in the world.

564
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:21,920
她想利用这种影响做些好事
She wanted to use it for good.

565
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:24,193
你太残忍了
You're cruel.

566
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:27,847
你毁掉那些无法奋起抵抗你的好人
You destroy good people who can't stand up to you.

567
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:30,737
并非每一个人都有你那样的力量
Not everyone shares your strength.

568
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:32,604
难道你不明白吗?
Can't you see that?

569
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:34,842
你管它叫公平竞争
You call it a fair fight,

570
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,515
但其实那不公平
but it isn't fair.

571
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:39,141
她的理解很不同
She saw it different.

572
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,268
她认为一个人过多的财富
She believed that a fortune for one man

573
00:32:41,305 --> 00:32:42,745
不应该建立在
that was more than he needed

574
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:45,423
上万个被毁灭的
should not be built on 10,000 ruined men

575
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,358
毫无生活来源的人身上
who were left without the means of life.

576
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:54,087
对你的孩子你显示出了如此多的柔情与爱
With your children you show such tenderness and love.

577
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:57,032
用同样的方式对待这个世界吧
Treat the world in the same way.

578
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:59,918
她发现我肯听她的话
She found that I listened to what she said.

579
00:32:59,956 --> 00:33:01,177
于是她就留了下来
So she stayed.

580
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:03,981
接着就发生了这件事情
And then this came along.

581
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:08,460
Gibson先生 你能不能对此说说看法?
Mr. Gibson, can you throw any light upon it?

582
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:11,656
有一种解释 福尔摩斯先生
One explanation, I give it to you Mr. Holmes

583
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:12,907
不管是不是真的
for what it's worth.

584
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:16,067
毫无疑问我的妻子极端嫉妒
There's no doubt that my wife was bitterly jealous.

585
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,811
她也许计划要谋杀Dunbar小姐
She might have planned to murder Miss. Dunbar

586
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:20,028
或者用枪威胁她
or threaten her with a gun

587
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:22,547
想吓唬她离开我们
and so frighten her into leaving us.

588
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:24,900
也许当时有一场混战
Maybe there was a scuffle.

589
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:28,256
枪走火了 打中了持枪的人
The gun went off and shot the woman who held it.

590
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,789
是的 是有这样一种可能
Yes, it is a possibility.

591
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:35,134
它是故意谋杀意外的唯一可能
It is the only alternative to deliberate murder.

592
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,601
不过她完全予以否认
But she utterly denies it.

593
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,469
这样的假设怎么能推翻得了呢?
What is against such a supposition?

594
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:41,344
Dunbar小姐本人就行
Miss. Dunbar herself.

595
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:44,379
还有一天就要开庭了
She has just one day left before the trial.

596
00:33:44,418 --> 00:33:47,466
你必须允许我再次去探访她
You must grant me permission to visit her once more.

597
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:50,960
如果在你的一生中 福尔摩斯 你曾经展示过你的能力
If ever in your life you showed your powers, Holmes,

598
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:55,299
现在就把它们用在这个案子中吧
put them into this case now.

599
00:33:55,762 --> 00:33:58,509
不过我无法向你保证
But I cannot promise you

600
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:02,120
我所得出的结论就是你想要的
that my conclusions will be such as you desire.

601
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,169
走吧 华生
Come Watson.

602
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:23,905
我们有几个生死攸关的问题
We have several vital questions

603
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,972
得去问问这位年轻的女士
to ask this young lady

604
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:27,839
我得承认
and I must confess that the case would seem to be

605
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:29,223
要不是因为一件事情
a very black one against her

606
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:30,566
这个案子确实会对她十分不利
if it were not for one thing.

607
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:31,667
什么事情?
What is that?

608
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:33,965
在她衣柜里发现了手枪
The finding of a pistol in her wardrobe.

609
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:36,987
那似乎是所有证据中最具毁灭性的
That seems to be the most damning incident of all.

610
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:38,663
并非如此 华生
Not so Watson.

611
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,632
这是我希望的唯一所在
It is my only firm ground for hope.

612
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,073
我们必须寻找事物间的联系
We must look for consistency.

613
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,483
在缺少联系的地方
Where there is a want of it,

614
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:47,547
我们就得怀疑存在着欺骗
we must suspect deception.

615
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,252
走吧 福尔摩斯
Come on Holmes,

616
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:55,114
Dunbar小姐还指望我们呢
Miss. Dunbar is depending on us.

617
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:58,894
华生 设想你自己站在Dunbar小姐的位置上
Watson visualize yourself in the character

618
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:03,198
预谋用一种冷酷的方式
of Miss. Dunbar with a cold premeditated fashion

619
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:04,410
除掉她的对手
is about to get rid of her rival.

620
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:06,521
你会怎样行动 会想些什么?
What would be your actions and your thinking?

621
00:35:06,558 --> 00:35:07,972
呃 我已经写过便条了
Well I've written a note.

622
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,114
受害人也来了
The victim has come.

623
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:12,659
我从枪火室里拿了手枪
I've taken the weapon from the gunroom.

624
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,623
犯下了罪行
The crime is done.

625
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:16,159
很娴熟 说得很完整
Workman like and complete,

626
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:17,318
现在是武器了
and now the weapon.

627
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:21,103
当然
Of course.

628
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:22,987
没错 华生
Precisely Watson.

629
00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:25,781
那些深渊也许将永远把它隐藏
Those depths would hide it forever.

630
00:35:26,442 --> 00:35:28,308
你最好的朋友不会认为你是个善谋的人
Your best friends would hardly call you a schemer,

631
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:30,163
然而我还是很难想像你把它带回家
yet I cannot picture you carrying it home

632
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:31,581
放进你的衣柜
and putting it in your wardrobe,

633
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,641
那可是第一个会被搜查的地方
the very first place that would be searched.

634
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,641
比如说这把手枪
This revolver for example,

635
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,102
她宣称完全不知道它的存在
she destains all knowledge of it.

636
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:38,996
你是说手枪是被放进她的衣柜的
You're saying that it was placed in her wardrobe,

637
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:39,545
不过是谁干的呢?
but by who?

638
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,362
某个想让她获罪的人
By someone who wished to incriminate her.

639
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,355
啊 Cummings
Ah, Cummings.

640
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,976
Dunbar小姐
Miss. Dunbar we have had lengthy conversations

641
00:35:52,978 --> 00:35:57,280
我们和Gibson先生进行了一次长谈
with Mr. Gibson and he has informed us

642
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:59,401
他把你们的关系以及你的清白
of your relations with him

643
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,532
都告诉了我们
and of your innocence in the matter.

644
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:02,059
你就不必再重复
But you need not pain yourself

645
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:03,269
徒增你的烦恼了
with that part of the story.

646
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:05,596
不过我们的确需要了解
But we do need to know something,

647
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:10,394
你对Gibson太太的感觉
of your feelings towards Mrs. Gibson.

648
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:16,600
我不想亵渎Gibson太太的在天之灵
I had no wish to wrong Mrs. Gibson.

649
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:19,880
不过她从肉体的角度
But she loved her husband

650
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:22,826
狂热地爱着她的丈夫
so vividly in a physical sense

651
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:24,895
以至于她无法理解
that she could hardly understand

652
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:29,616
我和他之间那种心灵的乃至精神上的契合
the mental even spiritual tie which held him to me

653
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:32,216
她也无法想像我仅仅是...
or imagined that it was only my desire

654
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:34,536
想影响他去做些好事
to influence his power for good

655
00:36:34,573 --> 00:36:37,817
才在他家里留了下来
which kept me under his roof.

656
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:40,726
我现在知道了我留下来是个错误
I can see now that I was wrong to stay.

657
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:43,503
留在这个是非之地
Nothing could have justified me in remaining

658
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:46,866
成为一场悲剧的导火线
where I was a cause of such unhappiness.

659
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:50,069
我的委托人也许不想说起它
My client may be loathe to mention it

660
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:53,323
不过她曾经说服Gibson先生
but she has managed to persuade Mr. Gibson

661
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:56,009
资助一项让部族重新定居的慈善计划
to finance a mission of mercy to resettle tribes.

662
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,337
特别是Bororo部族的印第安人
In particular the Bororo Indians

663
00:36:58,678 --> 00:36:59,972
他们已经成为了
who have fallen victim

664
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,775
肆无忌惮的金子和橡胶的勘探者的残害对象
to unscrupulous gold and rubber prospectors.

665
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:05,104
这种冒险活动现在十分猖獗
The venture is thriving.

666
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:08,132
我们在学校里见到了你的画像
We saw your pictures in the school.

667
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:10,779
就像那些英勇的印第安人
Like so many of those warrior Indians

668
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:13,856
Gibson先生有时候
Mr. Gibson can sometimes give people

669
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:15,479
会给人一种令人误解的印象
a misleading impression.

670
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:17,571
Dunbar小姐
Now Miss. Dunbar,

671
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:21,910
能不能告诉我们那天晚上 到底发生了什么?
will you tell us exactly what happened that evening?

672
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:25,347
那天早上我收到了Gibson太太的一张便条
I received a note from Mrs. Gibson in the morning.

673
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:30,079
恳求我在晚饭后 到桥上去见她
It implored me to meet her at the bridge after dinner.

674
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:32,823
那张便条你有没有留着?
This note, did you keep it?

675
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:33,478
没有
No.

676
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:34,863
她要求我把便条毁掉
She asked me to destroy it and to hide my answer

677
00:37:34,864 --> 00:37:38,467
再把我的回复藏在花园的日晷那里
at the sundial in the garden.

678
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:41,656
我不明白为什么要这么偷偷摸摸
I saw no reason for such secrecy

679
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,697
但她很怕她的丈夫
but she was very much afraid of her husband

680
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,859
他待她十分粗暴
who treated her with a harshness

681
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,871
为此我还经常责备他
by which I frequently reproached him.

682
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,372
我只能想像
I can only imagine that she did not wish him

683
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:52,098
她不希望他知道我们的会面
to know of our interview.

684
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,534
然而她非常小心地保存着你的答复
Yet she kept your reply very carefully.

685
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:57,474
是的 听到她死时手里还拿着它
Yes, I was surprised to hear she had it

686
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,883
我感到十分意外
in her hand when she died.

687
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,867
后来又发生了什么?
Well what happened then?

688
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:03,633
她等着我
She was waiting for me.

689
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,139
你到底是来了
So you have come.

690
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:08,381
直到那一刻我才意识到
Never did I realize

691
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,113
她有多么恨我
until that moment how much she hated me.

692
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:14,904
*西班牙语*
(Spanish).

693
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:16,648
她就像是个疯婆子
She was like a madwoman.

694
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:18,898
我想她的确是疯了
I think she was mad with a deep power of deception

695
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,327
带着疯子所有的那种自我欺骗
which insane people may have.

696
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:24,955
你真是残忍 你连心都没有
You're cruel, you have no heart

697
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,099
你不知道如何去爱
You don't know how to love.

698
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,108
你没有激情
You have no passion.

699
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,385
她每天见到我
How else could she have met me

700
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:31,244
又怎能不忧心忡忡呢
without concern every day.

701
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:35,528
她就在桥上站着
She was standing there on the bridge

702
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:38,463
尖叫着诅咒我
shrieking her curses at me.

703
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,604
英国荡妇
English whore.

704
00:38:39,643 --> 00:38:43,326
*西班牙语*
(Spanish)

705
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,960
我诅咒终有一天你会被烧死
I curse the day that you were born.

706
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:49,947
假设你离开不久她就被杀了
And yet presuming that she met her death

707
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:52,906
你并没有听到枪声?
shortly after you left, you heard no shot.

708
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:54,509
没有 我什么也没听到
No, I heard nothing.

709
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:57,606
她可怕的发作
I was so agitated and horrified

710
00:38:57,644 --> 00:38:58,804
使我又惊又怕
by her terrible outbreak

711
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:01,545
我冲回房间以寻求安宁
that I rushed to get back to the peace of my own room.

712
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:06,783
我完全没有注意到所发生的事情
I was incapable of noticing anything that happened.

713
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,091
你自己的房间
Your own room,

714
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:10,982
第二天早晨之前你离开过吗?
did you leave it again before the next morning?

715
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,539
是的 就在他们把那可怜的女人
Yes, when they brought the poor creature

716
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:16,095
搬回屋的时候
back to the house.

717
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,600
你觉得Gibson先生是不是看上去十分不安?
Did Mr. Gibson seem to you much perturbed?

718
00:39:24,636 --> 00:39:27,626
他是一个自制力很强的人
He is a very strong self-contained man.

719
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:28,906
我认为
I do not think

720
00:39:28,943 --> 00:39:31,383
他从来都不会把情绪写在脸上
he would ever show his emotions on the surface.

721
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:34,315
但是你是如此了解他
But you, who knew him so well.

722
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:38,409
是的 我可以看出他深深的忧虑
Yes, I could see that he was deeply concerned.

723
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:48,392
现在我们来谈最重要的一点
Now we come to the all-important point.

724
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,303
那把手枪是在你房间里发现的
This pistol that was found in your room,

725
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,294
你以前从未见过它吗?
you'd never seen it before?

726
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:53,872
从来没有 我发誓
Never, I swear it.

727
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:56,071
是什么时候发现的?
When was it found?

728
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:59,127
第二天早上警察搜查的时候
Next morning when the police made their search.

729
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,612
是的 就在你的衣服中吗?
Yes, among your clothes?

730
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,247
是的 在我衣柜的底部
Yes at the bottom of my wardrobe

731
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:04,665
其中一个抽屉里
in one of the drawers.

732
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,945
你想不出它在那儿有多久了
And you cannot guess how long it had been there.

733
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:09,321
事发当天早上之前它不可能在那儿
It could not have been there the morning before

734
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,072
因为我整理过衣柜
because I tidied out the wardrobe.

735
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,249
那么你是说有人进了你的房间
So you're suggesting that someone came into your room

736
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:16,713
并把它放在那里想嫁祸给你?
and placed it there in order to incriminate you?

737
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,500
应该是这样
It must have been so.

738
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:22,687
什么时候?
When?

739
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:26,691
只有可能是吃饭的时候
Well it could only have been at mealtime

740
00:40:27,314 --> 00:40:28,686
要不就是
or else during the hours

741
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:30,648
在我和孩子们呆在学习室的时候
when I would be in the schoolroom with the children.

742
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:32,690
也就是你收到便条的时候
As you were when you received the note.

743
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:34,677
是的 从那时开始
Yes, from that time onward

744
00:40:34,714 --> 00:40:35,711
整个早上
for the whole morning.

745
00:40:36,243 --> 00:40:38,210
谢谢 Dunbar小姐
Thank you Miss. Dunbar.

746
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:43,201
还有什么线索
Is there any other point

747
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,212
对我的调查有帮助呢?
which could help me in my investigation?

748
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:49,569
我想不起还有什么
I could think of none.

749
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:53,608
福尔摩斯 我可以跟你私下谈谈吗?
Holmes, might I have a word with you in private?

750
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:57,088
请原谅 Dunbar小姐
Forgive me Miss. Dunbar.

751
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:14,014
福尔摩斯 我愿意把我的案子给你办
Holmes I'd like to put you my case for believing

752
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:16,349
是因为我相信Gibson先生才是凶手
that Mr. Gibson is the murderer of his wife.

753
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:17,976
他自己也坦言
We have a man who by his own admission

754
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:21,372
他习惯了毁掉那些挡他道的人
is used to breaking people who stand in his path,

755
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:23,072
而他的妻子恰好就是挡了他的道
well his wife stood in his path.

756
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,745
但是Dunbar小姐拒绝了他
But then Miss. Dunbar rejected him.

757
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,989
于是还有什么比杀了一个
Now what better than to kill the one

758
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:29,175
而嫁祸给另一个更好的法子呢?
and incriminate the other?

759
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:36,790
真可谓是 一石二鸟之计
To kill the two birds with the one stone so-to-speak.

760
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,322
你不认为
You don't believe that

761
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,975
Gibson的自述是诚恳的?
Gibson's confession was sincere?

762
00:41:40,013 --> 00:41:41,009
Bates不是说了嘛
Wasn't it Bates who said

763
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:42,193
他是个善于花言巧语又诡计多端的人?
he was plausible and cunning?

764
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,210
他的自述也许是一种聪明的伎俩
His confession was a clever means

765
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:45,296
想让我们迷失方向
to put us off the scent.

766
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:46,829
这样想想吧
Think of it like this.

767
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:48,582
他不知怎么发现了
He somehow discovers

768
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:50,066
他的妻子安排了一次会面
that his wife has arranged a meeting.

769
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:53,332
白天的时候他从盒子里拿出了枪
During the day he takes the two pistols from the box.

770
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:56,751
其中一把打了一发子弹后
One he conceals in the drawer of her wardrobe

771
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:59,061
被藏入了她的衣柜
after discharging one barrel,

772
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,905
他可以在树林里轻易地开上一枪
which he could easily do in the woods

773
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:02,082
而不引起别人的注意
without attracting attention.

774
00:42:03,163 --> 00:42:05,051
整个晚上他都是一个人
He is alone all that evening.

775
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:09,257
他看见Dunbar小姐回来就抓住了机会
He sees Miss. Dunbar return and grasps his opportunity.

776
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:10,572
他犯下罪行之后
He commits the deed and flings the murder weapon

777
00:42:10,573 --> 00:42:14,091
就把武器远远地丢进了湖里
far into the lake.

778
00:42:21,132 --> 00:42:22,432
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

779
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,619
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

780
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:32,384
华生 我思维迟钝
Watson, I have been sluggish in mind

781
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:36,498
缺乏把想象与现实结合的能力
and wanting in that mixture of imagination and reality

782
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:39,769
这可是我破案的基础啊
which is the basis of my art.

783
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:43,812
你让我非常羞愧
You have put me entirely to shame.

784
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:50,570
你会听到我的消息的 Cummings先生
You'll be hearing from me Mr. Cummings

785
00:42:50,677 --> 00:42:52,231
我得到了正义之神
with the help of the god of justice

786
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:53,418
和我的同事华生医生的帮助
and my colleague Dr. Watson,

787
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:56,813
我将会给你一个让整个英国轰动的案子
I will give you a case that will make England ring.

788
00:42:57,218 --> 00:42:59,549
Dunbar小姐 我向你保证
Miss. Dunbar you have my assurance

789
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:01,956
在真相的曙光的照耀下
that the clouds are lifting

790
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:05,710
疑云正在消散
under the light of truth is breaking through.

791
00:43:05,747 --> 00:43:07,335
来吧 华生 来
Come Watson, come.

792
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,735
我们需要我们的好朋友Coventry警官
We need our good friend Sergeant Coventry

793
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:15,532
还有一个结实的线团
a ball of stout twine,

794
00:43:15,647 --> 00:43:18,044
和一个抓勾
and a grappling hook.

795
00:43:18,155 --> 00:43:19,994
抓勾?
Grappling hook?

796
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,716
华生 我记得
Watson, I have some recollection that

797
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:31,768
我们出来办案的时候你多半带着枪
you go armed on these little excursions of ours.

798
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,062
幸好我这样做
Just as well for you that I do.

799
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:34,314
我的左轮手枪
More than once my revolver has been

800
00:43:34,351 --> 00:43:36,131
可不只一次成了你的好朋友
a good friend to you.

801
00:43:36,169 --> 00:43:38,676
你很少在意自身的安危
You have little care of your own safety.

802
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:41,205
是的 在这种事情上
Yes, I am inclined to be absent minded

803
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,384
我总是心不在焉
in these matters.

804
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:45,067
你现在带了左轮手枪吗?
Do you have your revolver on you?

805
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:52,658
很重 出奇地重
It's heavy, remarkably heavy.

806
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:54,610
很结实的玩意儿
Solid bit of work.

807
00:43:54,722 --> 00:43:55,308
你知道吧
You know I believe this is going to have

808
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:57,918
我觉得这把枪和我们正在调查的疑案
a very intimate connection

809
00:43:57,955 --> 00:43:59,553
有着很密切的联系
with the mystery that we're investigating.

810
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:02,560
你不介意把子弹退出来吧?
Would you mind unloading it?

811
00:44:19,249 --> 00:44:21,114
今天晚上你在家吗 Gibson先生?
Will you be at home this evening Mr. Gibson?

812
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,297
我有消息要带给你
I shall have some news for you.

813
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:27,276
你可以有半天时间 福尔摩斯先生
You have half a day Mr. Holmes.

814
00:44:49,363 --> 00:44:52,247
以前你看见过我出错 华生
You have seen me miss my mark before Watson.

815
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,541
对这些事情我有一种本能
I have an instinct for such things

816
00:44:54,657 --> 00:44:57,957
但是这种本能有时也会误导我
but it has some times played me false.

817
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:59,328
我们只能试一试
We can but try.

818
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:02,837
你们两个可否准确地站在尸体所在的地方?
Will you both stand exactly where the body lay?

819
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,020
你关于这位金矿之王的理论
Your theory about the gold king,

820
00:45:08,134 --> 00:45:10,008
虽然从心理学的角度讲令人钦佩
though admirable in its psychology

821
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:14,879
却并不接近事实
did not quite adhere to the facts.

822
00:45:14,995 --> 00:45:20,564
把你自己代入这个女人的角色
Visualize yourself in the character of a woman

823
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:23,210
她冷酷地预谋着
who in a cold premeditated fashion

824
00:45:23,317 --> 00:45:25,858
要除去她的对手
is about to get rid of her rival.

825
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:32,470
我指的当然是Maria Gibson太太
I mean of course Mrs. Maria Gibson.

826
00:45:32,582 --> 00:45:34,563
因为你把Gibson当作罪犯的
For all your deductions about Gibson

827
00:45:34,671 --> 00:45:36,248
所有理论
being the perpetrator of this crime,

828
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:37,819
都可以用他太太来替入
substitute his wife.

829
00:45:37,856 --> 00:45:41,197
想像是她
Imagine that it was she

830
00:45:41,234 --> 00:45:43,740
从枪火室里拿走了手枪
who took the pistols from the gunroom,

831
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:46,712
在树林里开了一枪
who fired the single shot in the woods,

832
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,204
把枪放在Dunbar小姐的衣柜里
who placed the gun in Miss. Dunbar's wardrobe.

833
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:55,661
冷酷 狡猾
Cold, crafty,

834
00:45:55,775 --> 00:45:58,173
对每一个细节
premeditated,

835
00:45:58,282 --> 00:46:01,583
都预先做出谋划
down to the last detail.

836
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:17,361
这是否就是事实?
Was it ever an exact demonstration?

837
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:20,178
我的左轮手枪 福尔摩斯
My revolver Holmes.

838
00:47:15,177 --> 00:47:18,062
一个充满报复心的女人
A vindictive woman

839
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:20,190
一个热带来的人
a creature of the tropics,

840
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:22,058
充满激情 情绪不稳定
passionate, ill-balanced.

841
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:24,793
掩盖了她自己被害的真相
Disguising her own crime and fostering

842
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:28,598
挑起了对无辜受害者的谋杀指控
a charge of murder upon an innocent victim.

843
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:14,539
你帮助了一个非凡的女人 福尔摩斯
You have helped a remarkable woman, Holmes

844
00:48:14,576 --> 00:48:16,490
和一个强悍的男人
and a formidable man.

845
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:18,151
他们在一起
And if it seems

846
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:20,387
并非是不可能的事
that unlikely they should join forces?

847
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:22,924
自然我会祝他们一切顺利
Naturally I would wish them well.

848
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:26,648
你真是心地高尚 华生
Magnanimous of you Watson.

849
