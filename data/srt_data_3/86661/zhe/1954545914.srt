00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:45,911
有个年轻漂亮的女人
There's a very pretty young woman

6
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,603
走过街来
crossing the street

7
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:51,555
我想她可能要到这
and I think she may be coming here.

8
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:54,387
顺便说一句 我大概看了一下
Incidentally, I have glanced over

9
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:55,622
你对我工作的最新记录
your latest account of my work.

10
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,895
怎么了
Oh yes.

11
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,590
坦白的讲 我并不赞同
Honestly I cannot congratulate you upon it.

12
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,654
侦探学是一门非常精确的科学
Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science.

13
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,251
应是观察后的推理
Observation deduction

14
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,875
要有冷静非感性的大脑研究它
a cold and unemotional subject.

15
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:15,484
你试图给它加上浪漫的色彩
You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism,

16
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,202
这就像把爱情故事
which has much the same effect

17
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:18,867
或是一场私奔
as if you worked a love-story or an

18
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:22,270
变成欧几里德的第五个几何命题一样
elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.

19
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:23,964
一点都不搭调
Who can match that?

20
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,022
有位年轻的女士要见你 福尔摩斯先生
There's a young lady to see you Mr. Holmes.

21
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:32,756
是Mary Morstan
It's Mary Morstan.

22
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:35,216
这名字我一点都没印象
I have no recollection of the name.

23
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:40,900
别走 医生 我可能需要你
Don't go Doctor, I may need you.

24
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,878
我没猜错
I was right.

25
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,923
谢谢
Thank you.

26
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:49,889
Morstan女士
Miss Morstan.

27
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,008
下午好
Good afternoon.

28
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,749
我今天来找你 福尔摩斯先生
I have come to you Mr. Holmes

29
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:01,176
是因为你曾为我的雇主
because you once enabled my employer,

30
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:02,256
Cecil Forrester夫人
Mrs. Cecil Forrester,

31
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:05,683
解决了一次小型家庭纠纷
to unravel a minor domestic complication.

32
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:07,607
她对你的善意和智慧
She was much impressed

33
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,770
印象深刻
with your kindness and skill.

34
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:11,911
谢谢
Thank you.

35
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,770
我想象不出 有什么比我现在的处境
I can hardly imagine anything more strange,

36
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:30,869
更加...奇怪
more utterly inexplicable,

37
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:33,338
或是更令人费解的了
than the situation in which I find myself.

38
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:35,447
说说案情吧
State your case.

39
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,458
抱歉 失陪了
You will, I am sure, excuse me.

40
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:40,147
你的朋友再坐会吧
If your friend would be good enough to remain,

41
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:44,782
也许还需要他的帮助
he might be of inestimable service to me.

42
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,309
好吧
Of course.

43
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:58,994
简单的说...
Briefly the facts are these.

44
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:04,426
我父亲是一名派驻到印度的军官
My father was an officer in an Indian regiment.

45
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:08,445
我母亲在我还很小的时候就去世了
My mother died when I was still quite a child

46
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:12,216
他不得不把我送回国内
and he was forced to send me home,

47
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:15,231
虽然国内已没有亲戚在了
despite the fact that I had no relatives here.

48
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:17,544
我被安排在爱丁堡
I was placed in a

49
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:18,953
一个舒适的寄宿学校读书
comfortable boarding establishment

50
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,085
我一直在那儿
at Edinburgh, and I remained there

51
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:22,419
呆到17岁才离开
until I was 1 7 years of age.

52
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:26,599
就在那年 我父亲...
In that same year my father,

53
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:29,052
那个团里资格最老的上尉
who was a senior captain of his regiment,

54
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:35,680
请了一年的假回家
obtained 12 months' leave and returned home.

55
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,073
他到达伦敦后 发电报给我说
He telegraphed to me from London to say

56
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,359
他已平安到达
that he had arrived all safe

57
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:43,384
让我马上到这来
and directed me to come down at once,

58
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:46,467
给了我他居住的 Langham旅馆的地址
giving the Langham Hotel as his address.

59
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:50,428
我记得他的电报里
His message, as I remember,

60
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:53,128
充满慈爱
was full of love and kindness.

61
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:55,553
一到伦敦
On reaching London

62
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:58,031
我就直接去了Langham旅店
I drove straight to the Langham Hotel

63
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:01,015
那儿的人告诉我说 确实有一位Morstan上尉住在这里
and was informed that Captain Morstan

64
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,515
但是他已经出去两天了
was staying there,

65
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,108
还没有回来
but that he had gone out the night before

66
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,453
and had not returned.

67
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:08,294
于是我等在那里
So I waited

68
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,239
一整天
all day

69
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:15,462
没有他的任何消息
without news of him.

70
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:21,986
那天夜里
And that night,

71
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:25,101
在旅馆经理的建议下
on the advice of the manager of the hotel,

72
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,001
我找了警察
I communicated with the police,

73
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,289
第二天又在各种报纸上
the next day we advertised

74
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,792
登了寻人启事
in all the newspapers.

75
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:41,332
可是一点结果都没有
Our inquiries led to no result

76
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:44,913
从那天到现在
from that day to this

77
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,245
没有任何关于
no word has ever been heard

78
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:49,059
我不幸父亲的消息
of my unfortunate father.

79
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,998
他这次回来本希望
He came home with his heart so full of hope

80
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,140
找个安静的地方
to find some peace,

81
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:05,508
享享清福
some comfort,

82
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,767
没想到...
and instead

83
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,238
什么时候失踪的?
The date?

84
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,187
12月3日
The 3rd of December

85
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,997
十年前的今天
exactly 1 0 years ago.

86
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:26,903
他的行李呢?
His luggage?

87
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:29,013
在旅馆里
Remained at the hotel.

88
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:33,307
从那些东西里找不到什么线索--
Oh there was nothing in it to suggest a clue --

89
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:35,991
只有一些衣服 一些书
some clothes, some books,

90
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:37,951
还有很多Andaman岛上
and a considerable number of curiosities

91
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,918
带回来的古玩
from the Andaman Islands.

92
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:44,990
我父亲是那儿的一个军官
My father had been one of the officers

93
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,750
负责看守犯人
in charge of the convict-guard there.

94
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:48,590
华生 这地方有点乱
Watson this place is a mess.

95
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:50,100
他在伦敦有朋友吗?
Had he any friends in town?

96
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,890
我只知道一个人
Only one that we know of

97
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:55,657
叫Sholto少校 和他在一个团里
Major Sholto, of his old regiment,

98
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,506
驻孟买陆军第三十四团

99
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,539
当然我联系过他
We communicated with the Major, of course,

100
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:05,330
但是他似乎不知道
but he did not seem to know

101
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,041
他的好兄弟来到英国
that his brother officer was in England.

102
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,500
真是个奇怪的案子
It's a singular case.

103
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:18,885
我还没和你说到
I have not yet communicated to you

104
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:21,574
最奇怪的部分呢
the most singular part.

105
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:25,018
4年后
4 years later

106
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,195
泰晤士报上有一则广告
an advertisement had appeared in the Times

107
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:29,600
征询我的地址
asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan,

108
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:31,934
声称要是回复他
and stating that it would be to her advantage

109
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:33,628
就会会有好处
to come forward.

110
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,960
广告没有署名
There was no name appended.

111
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:38,432
那时侯
I had at the time

112

我刚刚进入Cecil Forrester夫人家
just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester

113
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,961
做家庭教师
in the capacity of governess

114
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:44,986
按照她的建议 我把地址登在了
and on her advice I published my address

115
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,020
报纸的广告专栏上
in the advertisement column.

116
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,880
就在同一天有个邮递员送给我
That same day there appeared through the post

一个小纸盒
a small cardboard box addressed to me,

一个很大的上等珍珠
a very large and lustrous pearl.

120
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:04,349
盒里没有一个字
No word of writing was enclosed.

121
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:08,267

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,042
没有任何寄珠人的线索
with no clue as to the sender.

125
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:16,149
行家鉴定了之后
They have been pronounced by an expert

126
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:17,692
说是很稀有的种类
to be of a rare variety

127
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:20,641
很值钱
and of considerable value.

128
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:23,283
你们请看
You can see for yourself

129
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,603

139
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:08,488

你打算怎么办 Morstan小姐?
this is a very pretty little problem.

这正是我要问你的
What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?

161
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:56,912
为你效力
if I can be of any service.

162
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,866
你们俩太好了
You are both very kind.

163
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,050
我生活很孤独
I have led a retired life

164
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,628
没有朋友可以相托
and have no friends whom I could appeal to.

165
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:07,536
我6点来 行吗
If I am here at 6 it will do, I suppose?

166
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:10,530
最晚6点 再见 Morstan小姐
Yes but you must not be later.

167
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,281
再见 福尔摩斯先生
Goodbye Miss Morstan.

168
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:13,914
再会
Goodbye Mr. Holmes.

169
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:15,981
再会
Au revoir.

170
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:16,409
Au revoir.

171
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:31,715
买束花吧
Buy a flower dearie.

172
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,100
买束花吧
Buy a flower.

173
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,618
买束花吧
Aw come on dearie.

174
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:38,821
抱歉
Excuse me.

175
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,269
多有魅力的女人啊!
What a very attractive woman

176
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:45,806
最重要的事就是
It is of the first importance

177
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:47,549
不要让一个人的特质
not to allow your judgment to be biased

178
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:49,475
影响了你的判断力
by personal qualities.

179
00:11:49,702 --> 00:11:51,434
一个委托人在我看来 仅仅是一个单元
A client to me is a mere unit,

180
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:53,001
问题中的一个元素
a factor in of the problem.

181
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:55,051
福尔摩斯 你真是个机器人
Holmes, you are a automaton

182
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:55,694
一台计算器
and a calculating machine.

183
00:11:55,732 --> 00:12:00,139
有时你一点人情味儿都没有

184
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,298
There's something positively inhuman in you at times.

185
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,223
我告诉你
I assure you

186
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,669
我生平所见最迷人的女人
the most winning woman I ever knew

187
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:05,088
毒死了三个孩子
was hanged for poisoning 3 little children

188
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,968
只为了骗取保险金
for their insurance money,

189
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:09,538
我还认识一个模样无比讨厌的男人
and the most repellent man of my acquaintance

190
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,439
却是个慈善家 捐赠大约25英镑
is a philanthropist who has spent nearly

191
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:14,014
给伦敦的贫民
a quarter of a million upon the London poor.

192
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:15,843
但是 在这件案子里...
However, in this case,

193
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:18,414
我从不例外
I never make exceptions.

194
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,115
定律没有例外
An exception disproves the rule.

195
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:22,669
我要出去了 一小时后见
I'm going out. I'll see you in an hour.

196
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,965
他在城里有朋友吗
<i>Had he any</i> <i>friends in town?</i>

197
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:42,949
只有一个
<i>Only one that</i> <i>we know of,</i>

198
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:45,952
叫Sholto少校 以前和他在一个团里
<i>Major Sholto of</i> <i>his own regiment.</i>

199
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:56,334
案子没什么神秘的
There is no great mystery in this matter

200
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:58,823
这些事实看来只有一种解释
the facts appear to admit of only one explanation.

201
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,875
你已经弄清楚了吗?
Oh so you've solved it already?

202
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,985
我发现在过期的泰晤士报上说
I have found,

203
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:05,219
住在上诺伍德的Sholto少校
on consulting the back files of the Times,

204
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:07,855
以前驻孟买陆军第三十四兵团
that Major Sholto, of Upper Norwood,

205
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,673
late of the 34th Bombay Infantry,

206
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:10,446
于6年前死亡
died just 6 years ago.

207
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:13,791
Hudson太太 您在这儿 还真是碍手碍脚
Mrs. Hudson you're dreadfully under foot.

208
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:15,754
也许我脑筋迟钝 福尔摩斯
I may be very obtuse, Holmes,

209
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,500
可我看不出这有什么启示
but I fail to see what this suggests.

210
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:18,540
真看不出?
Really?

211
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,033
没想到
You surprise me.

212
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:20,738
我们这么来看吧
Now look at it this way, then.

213
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:23,221
Morstan上尉失踪了

214
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:24,266
Captain Morstan disappears.

215
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:26,258
在伦敦 只有一个人他可能去拜访
The only person in London

216
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:27,651
那就是Sholto少校
whom he could have visited is Major Sholto.

217
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:30,770
Sholto少校否认知道 他曾来过伦敦
Major Sholto denies having heard

218
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:33,005
4年后Sholto死了
that he was even in London.

219
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,527
他死后不到一个星期
4 years later Sholto dies.

220
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:36,260
Within a week of his death

221
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,362
Morstan上尉的女儿
Captain Morstan's daughter

222
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,187
收到了一份价值连城的礼物
receives a valuable present,

223
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:41,047
以后每年收到一次
which is repeated from year to year

224
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,053
现在她又收到一封信
and now culminates in a letter,

225
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:45,715
说她是位受了委屈的女子
which describes her as a wronged woman.

226
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:48,039
她受过什么委屈呢?
Now what wrong can it possibly refer to

227
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:50,774
除了她丧父以外?
except this deprivation of her father?

228
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,319
卷尺
Tape measure,

229
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,925
枪
gun.

230
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:58,310
为什么这些礼物
And why should these presents

231
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:00,194
是在Sholto死后才送给她?
begin immediately after Sholto's death

232
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:02,473
除非是Sholto的后人
unless it is that Sholto's heir

233
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:03,723
知道其中的秘密
knows something of the mystery

234
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,879
想要做些补偿
and desires to make compensation?

235
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,483
准备好了吗 华生?
Are you ready Watson?

236
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,846
就等你了
And waiting.

237
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,290
你还有别的想法
Have you any alternative theory

238
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:16,595
可以解释这些事实?
that will meet the facts?

239
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,027
但 这真是个奇怪的补偿!
But what a strange compensation!

240
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,760
太奇怪了!
And how strangely made!

241
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:21,123
几点了?
What time is it?

242
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,864
6点15
It's a quarter past the hour.

243
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:37,291
晚上好 Ellis
Evening Ellis.

244
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:38,789
晚上好 先生
Evening sir.

245
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:41,644
为什么那个人
Why should somebody

246
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,778
现在才给她写信
write her a letter now,

247
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,714
而不是6年前呢?
rather than 6 years ago?

248
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:47,575
信上又说要还她公道
Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice.

249
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:48,777
她可以得到什么公道呢?
What justice can she have?

250
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:49,910
要说是她父亲还活着
It is too much to suppose

251
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,385
那未免太乐观
that her father is still alive

252
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,413
可是你又不知道
and there's no other injustice

253
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:54,948
她还受过什么别的委屈
in her case that you know of.

254
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:56,676
确实有些费解之处
There are difficulties

255
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,636
但事情总是如此
but there are always difficulties.

256
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:05,549
晚上好 福尔摩斯先生
Good evening Mr Holmes.

257
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,246
-我想我没... -晚上好
I do hope I'm not...

258
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:08,089
Good evening.

259
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:17,463
顺便说一声
By the way,

260
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,613
在爸爸的书桌里找到张奇怪的纸
a curious paper was found in Papa's desk,

261
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,308
没人能看懂
which nobody could understand.

262
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:25,379
我想这未必和案子有关
I don't suppose it is of the slightest importance,

263
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,148
但我想你可能愿意看一看
but I thought you might like to see it,

264
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:28,831
所以我带来了
so I brought it with me.

265
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,541
这纸像是印度产的
The paper appears to be of Indian manufacture.

266
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,850
以前被钉在了板子上
At some point it's been pinned to a board.

267
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,180
上面的图表像是
The diagram upon it appears to be the plan

268
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:42,931
大建筑物草图的一部分

269
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:43,358
of part of a large building

270
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:46,304
里面有许多房间 走廊和过道
with numerous halls, corridors, and passages.

271
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,468
上面用红笔画了个十字
There's a cross in red ink,

272
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:55,559
在一边写着"从左边3.37"
and on the side is written '3.37 from left.'

273
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:58,641
这有一个奇怪的象形文字
There is a curious hieroglyphic,

274
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,780
四个签名
The sign of four

275
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,240
Kartar Singh Indigo Singh
Kartar Singh, Indigo Singh,

276
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:07,183
Jagodish Singh Jonathan Small
Jagodish Singh, Jonathan Small.

277
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:10,752
这纸像是在钱夹里小心收藏过
It appears it has been kept carefully in a pocketbook,

278
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:12,715
因为纸两边都很干净
for the one side is as clean as the other.

279
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,648
就是在他的钱夹里发现的
It was in his pocketbook that we found it.

280
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,162
好好保管 Morstan小姐
Preserve it carefully, Miss Morstan.

281
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,110
现在我觉得这个案子
I begin to suspect that this case may be

282
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,488
似乎比最初想像的
much deeper and more subtle

283
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,059
更深奥更复杂
than I ever first supposed.

284
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:16,259
你们就是Morstan小姐 和她的同伴吗
Hey, are you the parties

285
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:17,962
我就是Morstan小姐
who come with Miss Morstan?

286
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:20,261
这两位是我的朋友
I'm Miss Morstan,

287
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,546
and these 2 gentlemen are my companions.

288
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:22,576
您得向我保证
I must ask you to give me your word

289
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:24,059
您的两位同伴中
that neither of your companions

290
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,494
没有警官
is a police officer.

291
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:27,312
我保证
I give you my word.

292
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:08,786
我的主人正在等候
Sahib awaits you.

293
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:12,061
让他们进来 我的男仆
Show them in, Khitmutgar.

294
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:14,417
直接把他们带到我这儿来
Show them straight in to me.

295
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:22,528
愿意为您效劳 Morstan小姐
Your servant, Miss Morstan.

296
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:26,530
愿意为两位效劳 先生们
Your servant, gentlemen.

297
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:29,315
进来 进来 进来
Come in.

298
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:32,432
进我这间小屋子来
Come in.

299
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:29,661
Come in.

300
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:33,278
Come in to my little sanctum.

301
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:35,665
我想你们不会介意
I trust you have no objection

302
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:38,659
烟草味儿吧?
to tobacco smoke?

303
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,585
有香油味儿的
The balsamic odor

304
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,554
东方烟草
of Eastern tobacco?

305
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,488
我有点紧张
I am a little nervous

306
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:52,983
我发现我的水烟袋是无上的...
and I find my hookah to be an invaluable...

307
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,386
...镇静剂
sedative.

308
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:14,406
打扰了 Sholto先生
You will excuse me Mr. Sholto

309
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:17,958
您让我来这里
but I am here at your request

310
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:19,417
是想告诉我
to learn something,

311
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,644
什么事情呢?
which you desire to tell me?

312
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,018
天有些晚了
It is getting very late and I should wish

313
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,540
我希望谈话越简短越好
the interview to be as short as possible.

314
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:30,721
嗯 要花些时间
Well it must take some time.

315
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:36,592
因为我们要去诺伍德
For we have to go to Norwood

316
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,525
见我哥哥Bartholomew
to see brother Bartholomew.

317
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:44,542
我们都要去
We must all see

318
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,490
也许我们可以说服
if we can get the better

319
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:56,054
of brother Bartholomew.

320
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:55,153
我哥哥Bartholomew

321
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,063
他对我发了火
He is angry with me for

322
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:05,276
因为我采取了我以为正确的行动

323
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:06,243
taking the course that has seemed right to me.

324
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:06,959
你们不知道
You cannot imagine

325
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,619
当他生气的时候

326
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:12,853
what a terrible fellow he is

327
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,753
会是个多么难缠的人
when he is angry.

328
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,425
要是我们去诺伍德
If we are to go to Norwood,

329
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:21,098
最好还是现在就动身
it would perhaps be as well

330
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,485
不
if we were start at once.

331
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,959
那不合适
No.

332
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,350
No that would hardly do.

333
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:27,375
我不知道怎么和他说
I don't know what he would say

334
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:29,793
要是我们这么唐突去见他
if we came upon him in that sudden way.

335
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:33,195
我必须让你们做好准备
No I must prepare you

336
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,054
把咱们彼此的处境
by showing you where we all stand

337
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:39,148
先谈一谈
to each other.

338
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:46,880
首先我要把我知道的一些事实
I must lay the facts before you,

339
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:50,793
告诉各位
as I know them myself.

340
00:20:55,688 --> 00:21:01,149
我父亲 就是已故的John Sholto少校
My father, the late Major John Sholto,

341
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:07,831
大约11年前来到上诺伍德
came to live at Pondicherry Lodge

342
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:11,791
定居于Pondicherry别墅
in Upper Norwood

343
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:13,482
some 1 1 years ago.

344
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:15,809
他在印度发了财
And he had prospered in India

345
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:17,960
带回来了
and brought back with him

346
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,585
一大笔钱
a considerable sum of money,

347
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:24,097
还有一批珍贵的古董
a collection of valuable curiosities,

348
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:28,355
和几个印度的仆人
and a staff of native servants.

349
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:30,150
因为这些
With these advantages

350
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:33,643
他生活得很富裕
he lived in great luxury.

351
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,810
那时我哥哥和我正在上大学
My brother and I were at university at the time.

352
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:39,212
然而 我们确实清楚
We did know, however,

353
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,196
有些秘密
that some mystery,

354
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,703
某种存在的危险
some positive danger,

355
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:47,081
藏在我父亲的心里
overhung our father.

356
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:51,860
他非常害怕
He was very fearful

357
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:54,661
独自一人外出
of going out alone,

358
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:58,344
他雇了2个职业拳击手
and he employed 2 prizefighters

359
00:21:58,382 --> 00:21:59,507
保护他
to guard him.

360
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:02,940
Williams 今晚送你们来的那个人
Williams, who drove you here tonight,

361
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:04,448
就是其中之一
was one of them.

362
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:05,841
出于某种原因
For some reason,

363
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:07,714
他从不告诉我们
he never told anyone,

364
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:13,431
我父亲对装有木腿的人格外提防
my father had a marked aversion

365
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:14,557
to men with wooden legs.

366
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:17,745
有一次他竟然开枪打伤了
On one occasion

367
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,420
he actually fired his revolver

368
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:20,296
一个只有一条腿的人
at a one-legged man.

369
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:24,683
那人只不过是个平常的商贩
A harmless tradesman as it turned out.

370
00:22:31,303 --> 00:22:37,009
我记得当时我们 赔了很大一笔钱才了事
I remember we have to pay

371
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,869
a considerable sum to hush it up.

372
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:41,933
然后 突然
Then suddenly

373
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:48,080
我父亲收到了一封信
my father received a letter

374
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:54,077
那封信对他是很大的打击
It was a great shock to him.

375
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:06,685
出去
Out.

376
00:23:07,457 --> 00:23:09,094
从房间出去!
Out of the room!

377
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,912
从房间出去!
Out of the room!

378
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,039
信上说了什么
What was in the letter

379
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:33,560
我们永远不知道
we could never discover?

380
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,018
我父亲多年身患
For years my father had suffered

381
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:41,136
脾脏肿大的毛病

382
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:42,422
with an enlarged spleen

383
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:43,372
从那时起
and from that moment on

384
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:45,841
他的病情变得更糟
he became rapidly worse.

385
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:51,408
一天晚上医生通知我们说 没希望了
But one night the doctor informed us there was no hope

386
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:56,327
要我们听他的最后的遗嘱
and that he wished to make a last communication to us.

387
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:01,397
我亲爱的家人
My dear family,

388
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:08,239
我在印度的时候

389
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,556
when we were in India

390
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:12,865
我的朋友 Morstan和我
my friend, Morstan and I,

391
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:16,334
得到了一大笔的
came into possession

392
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,877
宝物
of a considerable treasure.

393
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:24,988
我把它们带回了这里
I brought it home with me to this house,

394
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,644
至今还在这
where it's still alive.

395
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,627
那天 Morstan先生
On the day, Mr. Morstan,

396
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:39,060
从印度回来
had arrived home from the East.

397
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:44,784
他直接找到这里
He came straight to this house

398
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:48,654
指责我独吞了财宝
to claim his share.

399
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:51,598
我们发过誓 Sholto
We gave our word Sholto.

400
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:52,572
一个诺言
A promise.

401
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,823
我们发过毒誓
We gave our word and our oath.

402
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,259
另一时间
another time,

403
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,240
另一种生活 另一个世界
another life, another world,

404
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:01,076
一个庄严的诺言
a solemn promise.

405
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,744
你背叛了我 Morstan
You tried to betray me Morstan.

406
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:06,548
要是你敢背叛我...
If you dare to cross me...

407
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:12,253
上帝
My God.

408
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,121
他死了 Altada
The man is dead Altada.

409
00:25:15,158 --> 00:25:17,171
不用害怕 先生
You have nothing to fear Sir.

410
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,289
下面的我来安排
I will arrange everything.

411
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:23,582
一会他就弄完了 Morstan小姐
And soon it was done Miss Morstan,

412
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,100
当然是极其秘密的
in secrecy of course

413
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:29,736
但是不失尊重
but with respect.

414
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:31,521
这确实很可耻 Sholto先生
This is disgraceful Mister Sholto.

415
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:34,829
你父亲的行为是不可原谅的
Your father's behavior was quite unforgivable.

416
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,123
拜托 医生
Please Doctor.

417
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,624
我打心底知道
I knew in my heart

418
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:44,147
他已死了
that he was dead.

419
00:25:46,014 --> 00:25:48,498
但我父亲并不孤单
My father was not alone then.

420
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,280
我很高兴他没受罪
And I'm glad he didn't suffer.

421
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,930
你很勇敢 Morstan小姐
You're very brave Miss Morstan.

422
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:01,392
现在我所关心的是那场争吵
What concerns me now

423
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,851
我不能想象
is the wishing for this quarrel.

424
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:05,593
我父亲是怎么卷进这个财宝的
I cannot imagine how my father

425
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:07,010
came to be involved with that treasure.

426
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:11,162
恐怕事情还不清楚 Morstan小姐
I'm afraid that is not clear Miss Morstan

427
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,360
我只能告诉你
I can only tell you

428
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:21,467
我父亲对我们说的
my father's instructions concerning it.

429
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:31,806
贪...婪

430
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,549
The greed.

431
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:37,415
可憎的贪婪一生折磨着我
accursed greed that has been

432
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:38,491
my besetting thing throughout my life

433
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:41,236
我抢走了她的财产
has robbed her of the treasure.

434
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:45,387
至少有一半是她的
Half of which, at least,

435
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:47,375
应该还给她
should be hers.

436
00:26:48,447 --> 00:26:57,497
你们看这串项链
You see that chaplet there.

437
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:04,968
我想把它送给她

438
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:05,587
I had the design of sending it to her

439
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:11,746
但是又舍不得
but could not bear to part with it.

440
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,785
你们
You

441
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,623
我的儿子们
my sons

442
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:19,873
一定要让Morstan小姐
must see that Miss Morstan

443
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:33,516
得到属于她的一份
gets her share of the treasure.

444
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:38,854
把他赶走
Get him away.

445
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:44,682
看在上帝的份上 把他赶走
For Christ's sake get him away.

446
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,083
我们冲到窗前 跑到花园中
We ran to the window and out into the garden

447
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:51,719
但是那个人已经没了
but the intruder was gone.

448
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:54,687
我父亲死了
My father was dead.

449
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:58,808
不久我们就得到了更确切的证明
We soon had more striking proof that there were

450
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,474
有秘密组织在盯着我们
secret agencies that work all around us.

451
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:07,949
第二天有人闯进我父亲的卧室
The next day my father's bedroom was broken into

452
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:13,914
这个被放在了他的胸前
and this was fixed to his chest.

453
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,862
很关键
Remarkable.

454
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:22,618
这是印度锡克教数字4的标记
It is the Sikkh symbol for the numeral 4.

455
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,951
这张纸是什么意思
What the paper means

456
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:31,568
还有我们神秘的来访者是谁
and who our secret visitor or visitors were

457
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:34,338
我们都不知道
we never found out.

458
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:42,423
我哥哥和我都很兴奋
And my brother and I were much excited

459
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,684
你们能想象出来
as you could imagine

460
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,478
都是由于我父亲说的财宝
of the treasure that my father had spoken

461
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,771
但是 我们竭尽所能都没有找到
but try as we might we couldn't find it.

462
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:50,164
我们有些发狂 只要想到收藏宝藏的地方
It was maddened to think that the hiding place

463
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:53,323
就在他临终的嘴边
was on his very lips when he died.

464
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:57,309
从这个项链上 我们就可以
We could judge the splendor of the riches

465
00:28:57,347 --> 00:28:59,819
看出这批财宝的贵重
by the chaplet, which he had taken out.

466
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:02,519
这几颗珍珠都很值钱
The pearls were evidently of great value,

467
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,598
我哥哥不愿意把它们给她
and my brother was averse to part with them,

468
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:09,647
在对待朋友上
for, between friends,

469
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:13,436
他也有点我父亲的缺点
he was a little inclined to my father's fault.

470
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:16,579
我所能做的只是规劝他
And it was all I could do was to persuade him

471
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:18,696
允许我每隔一段时间给Morstan小姐
to allow me to send Miss Morstan

472
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,848
一颗拆下来的珍珠
a detached pearl at regular intervals

473
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,441
这样她就不会生活拮据了
so that she would not feel destitute.

474
00:29:24,478 --> 00:29:27,013
真是好心眼
It was a kindly thought.

475
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,870
你真是太好心了
No it was very good of you.

476
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,217
我们只是你的托管人
We were your trustees

477
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:37,603
这是我的看法
that was the way I looked at it,

478
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,189
虽然我哥哥和我看法不同
although my brother

479
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:44,375
我们自己有很多钱
did not altogether see it in that light.

480
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,966
We had plenty of money ourselves.

481
00:29:44,412 --> 00:29:48,818
用卑劣的手段
It would have been in such bad taste

482
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:51,646
对待一位年轻的女士
to have treated a young lady

483
00:29:51,683 --> 00:29:54,842
实在是情理难容
in so scurvy a fashion.

484
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:57,637
就在昨天
Yesterday an event

485
00:29:57,674 --> 00:30:02,945
发生了一件极其重要的事

486
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:03,325
of extreme importance occurred.

487
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,537
我们找到财宝了
We, found of the treasure.

488
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:16,222
因此 我立即联系了Morstan小姐
Hence my instant communication to you Miss Morstan.

489
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,172
我们现在要做的就是去诺伍德
Now all we have to do is to drive to Norwood

490
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,687
向他索要我们应得的那份
and claim our share.

491
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:28,873
在他眼中 我们也许是
We shall be expected,

492
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:33,326
不受欢迎的客人
if not entirely welcome, visitors.

493
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:36,653
你从头到尾做得都很好 Sholto先生
You have done well from first to last Mr. Sholto.

494
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:45,139
我身体很弱
My health is somewhat fragile.

495
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:50,167
只能算个病人
I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.

496
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:53,110
请

497
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,527
Please?

498
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:08,643
花园的每个角落我们都挖过
We dug up every inch of the garden

499
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,861
没有任何发现
without discovering anything.

500
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:16,454
我哥哥Bartholomew很聪明
Brother Bartholomew is such a clever fellow.

501
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:19,175
你们知道他是怎样
Do you know how he found out

502
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,953
发现宝藏的吗
where the treasure was?

503
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,128
说
Tell me.

504
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,711
他测量了每个角落
He made measurements everywhere,

505
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:25,938
从上面
all along the top,

506
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:28,054
侧面 里面
along the side, inside and he found out

507
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:32,358
最后在离房顶4英尺的地方

508
00:31:29,944 --> 00:31:33,418
he was 4 foot out at the top.

509
00:31:32,396 --> 00:31:35,694
我们发现了父亲建的一个小顶楼
We found our father made a false room

510
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:40,801
他在板条灰泥天花板上打了个洞

511
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,896
So he smashed through the lath and the plaster

512
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:44,081
宝箱就在...
and there was the treasure chest

513
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,682
椽木上
lying across the rafters.

514
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,717
他估算了一下
He has computed the value of the treasure

515
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:50,623
差不多超过...

516
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:54,574
50万英镑
to be more than one half million sterling.

517
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,390
[scream]

518
00:31:58,178 --> 00:31:59,587
是Bernstone夫人
It's Mrs. Bernstone.

519
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:02,869
Bernstone夫人是这房子里唯一的女人
Mrs. Bernstone is the only lady in the house

520
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:04,871
在这等着
wait here.

521
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:20,862
Thaddeus先生 真高兴您来了
Oh, Mr. Thaddeus I'm so glad you've come!

522
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:24,084
真高兴您来了 先生
I'm so glad you've come, sir!

523
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:29,821
真是个奇怪的地方!
What a strange place!

524
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:36,120
好像全英国的鼹鼠都跑到这来了
It looks as if all the moles in England

525
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,858
have been let loose in it.

526
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:41,364
Bartholomew好像出事了
There's something amiss with Bartholomew

527
00:32:41,402 --> 00:32:42,739
进屋去!
Into the house!

528
00:32:57,532 --> 00:33:00,725
上帝保佑 看您这张甜美安静的脸多好
bless your sweet, calm face.

529
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:03,862
我这一天可真是受够了
Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day.

530
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:05,905
怎么了 Bernstone夫人?
How Mrs. Bernstone?

531
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:09,115
Bartholomew先生把自己关在屋里
Mr. Bartholomew shut himself in his room

532
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,181
没和我说一句话
and I can't get a word out of him.

533
00:33:11,218 --> 00:33:13,248
没有睡觉
His bed hasn't been slept in

534
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:16,761
也没下楼吃过东西
and he hasn't been down for any food.

535
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,569
他工作的时候我不敢打扰他
I dare not disturb him at his work.

536
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:21,975
你知道他工作时候的样子
You know what he's like when it's his work.

537
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:24,232
照顾好她 Morstan小姐
Look after her Miss Morstan.

538
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:32,124
来 冷静一下
There, there do try to calm down.

539
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:34,293
瞧 一切都会好的
Look I'm sure everything will be all right.

540
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,720
希望你是对的 小姐
I do hope your right Miss.

541
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:38,603
坐这里
Sit down over there.

542
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:49,419
过来
Come.

543
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:01,720
哪个门?
Which is the door?

544
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,496
里面情况很糟糕 华生
There's something devilish in this, Watson.

545
00:35:19,143 --> 00:35:21,693
又是四签名
The sign of the four again.

546
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:23,728
这一切是怎么回事?
What in God's name does it all mean?

547
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:25,754
谋杀
It means murder.

548
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:33,386
昨晚我们把财宝搬下来 放在那里

549
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:32,621
We brought the treasure down there last night.

550
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:36,634
现在不见了
Now its gone.

551
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:37,812
那是几点的事
What time is that?

552
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:41,679
不...不知道

553
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:42,385
I don't know.

554
00:35:41,826 --> 00:35:45,639
我想是6点或是7点
I think six, or seven.

555
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,883
我走后听见他锁门了

556
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:52,682
I heard him lock the door after I left.

557
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:56,912
我一定是最后见到他活着的人
I must have been the last person to see him alive.

558
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,371
现在他死了
And now he's dead

559
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:06,508
你想是我干的?
you think I did it?

560
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:08,527
我没有 为什么我要...
I didn't, why should I,

561
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:09,518
我不会让你...
I wouldn't have wanted you...

562
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:10,869
我不会请你来...
I wouldn't have asked you to...

563
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:12,121
我要疯了

564
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,338
冷静 冷静 冷静  Sholto先生
I'll go mad.

565
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,679
我建议你报警
Gentle, gently, gentle Mr. Sholto.

566
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:17,930
把你知道的一切告诉他们
I suggest that you go down to the police station

567
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,978
我们等你回来
and tell them everything that you know.

568
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:20,967
We shall wait here until you return.

569
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:23,078
福尔摩斯 看这个
Holmes look at this.

570
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,211
小心
Careful!

571
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,532
上面有毒
Forgive me, its poisoned.

572
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:30,471
华生 我们还有些时间
Well Watson we have a little time

573
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:32,173
弄清楚整个过程
let's make the most of it.

574
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,749
这件事真是扑朔迷离
Awe this is an Insoluble mystery to me.

575
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:36,500
不止没搞明白 反而越来越糊涂了
It grows darker instead of clearer.

576
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:38,234
不 不 不 马上就会水落石出
No, no, no, no it clears every instant.

577
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:39,742
我只要再弄清几个环节
I only require a few missing links

578
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:42,243
就可以把整个案子串联起来
to have an entirely connected case.

579
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,152
现在案子看上去很简单了
Simple as the case seems now

580
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:47,098
还有几件事不明白
there may be something deeper underlying it.

581
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:49,348
这些人怎么进来的
How did these people come

582
00:36:49,385 --> 00:36:50,347
怎么出去的
and how did they go?

583
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:51,630
这些人?
People?

584
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,758
要从这种地方搬走财宝箱
Well it takes more than one, perhaps more than 2

585
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:56,867
需要不止一个人 或许两人以上
to remove a heavy treasure chest

586
00:36:56,905 --> 00:36:59,631
门从昨晚就没开过
from a place like this.

587
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,655
The door hasn't been opened since last night.

588
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:02,125
那这些窗户呢?
So how about these windows?

589
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:10,658
插销在里面
Snibbed on the inside.

590
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,947
没有合叶
No hinges.

591
00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:14,796
屋顶离的很远
Roof quite out of reach.

592
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,990
附近没有排水管
No drainpipe near.

593
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:20,886
有人可能从这进来 看 华生
Yet someone has entered this way look.

594
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:23,156
窗台上有足迹
Watson.

595
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:25,273
See that a scuff on the sill.

596
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:32,438
看这个 华生
Look at this Watson

597
00:37:33,992 --> 00:37:35,888
这儿和这儿
and this and this.

598
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:37,756
这真是个非常好的证据
This is a very pretty demonstration.

599
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:40,041
但那不是脚印
But that's not a footmark.

600
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:41,885
这东西对我们更有价值
Something much more valuable to us.

601
00:37:41,922 --> 00:37:43,091
这个靴子的痕迹
This is mark of a boot and this

602
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:49,386
这是木腿的痕迹

603
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:49,942
this the mark of the timber toe.

604
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:51,201
他是一个有一条木腿的人
It is a wooden-legged man.

605
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:53,743
而另一个人是
And someone else.

606
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:57,879
很能干 很灵活的同谋
A very able and efficient ally.

607
00:37:57,918 --> 00:38:00,020
你能从那个墙爬过来吗 华生?
Could you scale that wall, Watson?

608
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:10,759
肯定不能
Absolutely impossible.

609
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:11,826
没有帮忙是不能的
I aid it is so

610
00:38:11,864 --> 00:38:14,711
但假定你有一个朋友
but suppose you had a friend

611
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:18,446
他把这根结实的绳子
who lowered you this good stout rope

612
00:38:18,483 --> 00:38:20,647
牢牢的系在那个环子上
securing it first to this ring.

613
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:23,556
我想只要你有力气
I think if you were an active man,

614
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,250
你就可以爬过去
you'd be able to swarm up,

615
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:26,607
即使是装着木腿
wooden leg and all.

616
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,293
你离开的时候 当然
You would depart, of course,

617
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,401
可以用同样的方式
in the same fashion, and then your friend

618
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:32,055
你的朋友会收起绳子

619
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:33,068
would pull up the rope,

620
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:37,140
关上窗子
close the window,

621
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:38,982
从里面栓牢
snib it on the inside,

622
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:41,707
把它复原成来时候的样子
and depart in the manner he originally came.

623
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:47,564
情况比刚才更莫名其妙了
Well the thing grows more unintelligible than ever.

624
00:38:47,602 --> 00:38:49,958
这个神秘的同谋是谁?
How about this mysterious ally?

625
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,767
他是怎样进屋的?
How did he get into the room?

626
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:54,641
不错 那个同谋
Yes, this ally.

627
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:56,057
他使案子变得
He lifts this case

628
00:38:56,095 --> 00:38:58,361
异乎寻常
from the regions of the commonplace.

629
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:02,132
门是关着的 窗户够不到
Well the door is locked; the window inaccessible.

630
00:39:03,086 --> 00:39:04,447
壁炉又太小
The grate's too small.

631
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:05,440
怎么办到的呢?
How then?

632
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:06,881
你总是不跟着我的思路
You will not follow my precept.

633
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,164
我和你说过多少次了
How often have I said to you

634
00:39:08,203 --> 00:39:09,923
一旦你排除掉不可能的因素
that once you have eliminated the impossible,

635
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,514
不论剩下什么
whatever remains,

636
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,107
不论多么不可能
however improbable,

637
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:15,300
那一定是事实
must be the truth?

638
00:39:19,947 --> 00:39:22,138
他肯定是从屋顶下来的
He must of come in through the roof.

639
00:39:22,177 --> 00:39:23,729
好极了 华生 拿着灯
Excellent Watson, hold this lamp.

640
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:25,978
咱们去查看一下上面的空间
Let us carry our research to the room above

641
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:30,181
就是放财宝的密室
the secret room in which the treasure was found.

642
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:36,744
天窗
The skylight.

643
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,244
福尔摩斯 是个小孩干了这么恐怖的事

644
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:54,809
Holmes a child has done this horrid thing.

645
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:56,071
我忘记了
My memory failed me,

646
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:59,076
我本应该料到的
for I should have been able to foretell it.

647
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:01,313
这里没什么可搜的了
There is nothing we can learn from here.

648
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,625
我们下去吧
Let us go down.

649
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,815
你对那些脚印有什么结论?
What is your theory about those footmarks?

650
00:40:14,853 --> 00:40:16,588
华生 请你自己做点分析
My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself.

651
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:17,513
你知道我的方法
You know my methods.

652
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:18,590
应用他们
Apply them.

653
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:19,905
我从这些证据上
I cannot conceive of anything

654
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,603
什么也总结不出来
that will cover the facts.

655
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:24,266
你不久就会清楚了
You will soon.

656
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,539
我们运气好
We're in luck.

657
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,315
我们的小同谋
Our little ally

658
00:40:48,352 --> 00:40:50,316
踩到了木馏油
has trod in the creosote.

659
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:53,831
[Voices from afar].

660
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,794
看那个
Ahh, look at that.

661
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:02,294
你们住的小地方还真好
Quite a nice little place you got here.

662
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:06,852
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

663
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:09,035
我猜是那些法律的代表者们
representatives of the law

664
00:41:09,073 --> 00:41:11,353
要不就是我犯了非常大的错误
unless I'm very, very much mistaken.

665
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:12,613
华生
Now Watson

666
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,069
在他们来之前
before they come

667
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:17,158
你对这个可怜的家伙有什么看法?
what do you make of this poor fellow?

668
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:19,883
肌肉像木板一样僵硬
The muscles are stiff as a board.

669
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,575
极其强烈的收缩状态
A state of extreme contraction,

670
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:25,652
远比一般的死后僵硬要厉害
far exceeding the usual rigor mortis.

671
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,762
很对
Quite so.

672
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:29,079
再加上脸部的扭曲
Coupled with this distortion of the face,

673
00:41:29,116 --> 00:41:30,889
希波克拉底式的笑容
the Hippocratic smile,

674
00:41:30,926 --> 00:41:34,149
这是被老派作家称为讥笑的笑容
risus sardonicus, as the old writers called it,

675
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:36,371
你心里有结论了吗?
what would that suggest to your mind?

676
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,878
死于某种植物性生物碱的剧毒
Death from a powerful vegetable alkaloid

677
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,723
某种番木鳖碱
some strychnine-like substance

678
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,585
能造成破伤风
that produces tetanus.

679
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:48,722
Well,

680
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,384
右转
to the right,

681
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:51,985
先生们 向右转
come on along gentleman to the right.

682
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,861
上楼梯
Up these stairs.

683
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,190
这根荆棘
This thorn.

684
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,651
英国荆棘
old English thorn.

685
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,669
我想不应该让Morstan小姐
I think it is not right that Miss Morstan

686
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:12,722
呆在这个遭殃的屋子里了
remain in this stricken house.

687
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,091
你把他送回家去 华生
I suggest you slip away and take her home Watson

688
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:17,159
然后去Pinchin巷 3号
and then go to 3 Pinchin Lane,

689
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:19,232
Lambeth区 找Toby来
Lambeth and ask for Toby.

690
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,292
Pinchin巷 3号
3 Pinchin Lane.

691
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,169
我宁愿要Toby的帮忙
I'd rather have Toby's help than that of the

692
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,389
比全伦敦的警察都得力
whole protective force London.

693
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:32,226
这成什么样子了!
Well here's a pretty business!

694
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,533
屋里挤得像个养兔场!
Place is as full as a rabbit-warren!

695
00:42:38,943 --> 00:42:41,537
我想你一定还记得我吧
I think you better recollect me,

696
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:44,635
Athelney Jones先生
Mr. Athelney Jones.

697
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,731
我当然记得!
Why, of course I do!

698
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:55,326
夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生 大理论家
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist.

699
00:42:55,362 --> 00:42:58,351
我永远忘不掉 那次你给我们做的演讲
I'll never forget that you lectured us all

700
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:01,153
关于那件主教珍宝案
about the Bishopgate jewel case.

701
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:04,571
你确实把我们引上正确的思路
True you set us on the right track then

702
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:06,948
我想你得承认
I think you'll own now

703
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:09,055
那是因为运气好而不是正确的引导
it is more by good luck than good guidance.

704
00:43:09,092 --> 00:43:11,289
那是一个很简单的推理
It was a piece of very simple reasoning.

705
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:13,573
算了吧
Oh, come, now, come!

706
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,831
别不好意思承认
Never be ashamed to own up.

707
00:43:16,738 --> 00:43:22,078
可这是怎么一回事?
But what is all this?

708
00:43:22,752 --> 00:43:24,436
太糟糕了
It's a bad business!

709
00:43:24,473 --> 00:43:26,565
太糟糕了!
Bad business!

710
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:31,150
严酷的事实摆在这
Stern facts here

711
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:34,132
用不着理论了
no room for theories.

712
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,867
真是太巧了 我路过诺伍德
It's lucky I happened to be up at Norwood

713
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:40,117
接到报案时 我正在忙另一个案子
on another case when I got the message.

714
00:43:40,155 --> 00:43:42,120
你认为这人是怎么死的?
How do you think this man died?

715
00:43:42,157 --> 00:43:44,545
这个案子似乎不需要我的理论
This is not a case for me to theorize over.

716
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:46,454
是不需要
No, no, no.

717
00:43:46,492 --> 00:43:48,063
可是 我们不得不承认
Still, we can't deny

718
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,586
你有时真能一言中的
you hit the nail on the head sometimes.

719
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:58,310
门是锁着的
Door locked, I understand.

720
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:02,262
财宝丢失了
Jewels worth a fortune missing.

721
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:02,987
窗户的情况怎么样
How were the windows?

722
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:05,623
关得很紧 不过窗台上有脚印
Fastened; but there was a footstep on the sill.

723
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,148
窗户关着的
Windows fastened.

724
00:44:07,185 --> 00:44:10,638
脚印便与本案无关 这是常识
Nothing to do with it. It's common sense.

725
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,159
我猜这个人是猝死的
Man could have died in a fit I suppose.

726
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:21,105
哈!
Ha!

727
00:44:21,143 --> 00:44:22,998
我有一个解释
I have a theory.

728
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,958
有时我也能灵机一动呢
These flashes come to me sometimes.

729
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,058
警长 你先出去
Sergeant, outside if you please.

730
00:44:28,095 --> 00:44:31,053
你也是 Sholto先生
And you too, Mr. Sholto.

731
00:44:34,827 --> 00:44:37,191
你怎么想的 福尔摩斯先生?
What do you think of this, Holmes?

732
00:44:37,227 --> 00:44:39,707
Sholto已经承认了
Sholto has confessed

733
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:41,709
昨晚他和他哥哥在一起
he was with his brother last night.

734
00:44:42,355 --> 00:44:43,578
他哥哥猝死后
The brother died in a fit.

735
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:44,886
Sholto带着财宝跑了?
Sholto walks off with the treasure?

736
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:45,745
真是这样吗
How about that?

737
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:47,298
这个死人倒还细心
Whereupon a dead man very considerately

738
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:50,938
命都没了还起来把门锁上
gets up and locks the door from the inside.

739
00:44:52,296 --> 00:44:53,818
哼!
Hum!

740
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:59,101
这是个破绽
There's a flaw there somewhere.

741
00:45:01,638 --> 00:45:05,640
咱们根据常识来想想
Let us apply common sense to the matter.

742
00:45:05,678 --> 00:45:07,100
他们是兄弟
They were brothers

743
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,233
争吵过
there was a quarrel

744
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:13,438
哥哥Bartholomew死了
brother Bartholomew dead

745
00:45:13,475 --> 00:45:14,780
珠宝不见了
jewels gone.

746
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:16,998
而Thaddeus
And master Thaddeus

747
00:45:17,035 --> 00:45:20,565
极为恐惧不安
evidently in a disturbed state of mind.

748
00:45:20,602 --> 00:45:24,136
他外表还行 但不怎么迷人
His appearance well, not attractive.

749
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:25,341
你看
You see

750
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:30,564
我正在结网 要网住Thaddeus
I'm weaving a web around Thaddeus.

751
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,732
这张网要套住他了
The net begins to close upon him.

752
00:45:34,454 --> 00:45:35,625
Jones
Jones

753
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:38,314
那个小木刺
that splinter,

754
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:43,521
我想那有毒
which I firmly believe to be poisoned,

755
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,048
那张纸和那根样子奇怪的木棍
that card and that curiously shaped instrument

756
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:49,048
放在桌子上
were lying there on the table.

757
00:45:52,937 --> 00:45:55,592
从各方面来看
Confirms my theory

758
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,285
都能证实我的结论
in every respect.

759
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,982
这个屋里到处是印度的古玩
The house is full of Indian curiosities.

760
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:03,105
所有证据都指向Thaddeus
All point to Thaddeus.

761
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:08,019
但是...
But

762
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,103
他是怎么逃走的呢?
how did he escape?

763
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:17,243
屋顶上有个洞...警官!
There is a trapdoor in the roof Sergeant.

764
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:22,925
让Sholto先生进来?
May I ask Mr. Sholto to step this way?

765
00:46:23,868 --> 00:46:28,761
毕竟事实胜于雄辩
You see facts are better than theories, after all.

766
00:46:28,798 --> 00:46:31,128
我的看法完全得到证实
My view of the case is confirmed.

767
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,630
有一个天窗
There is a trapdoor

768
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,089
连接着屋顶
communicating with the roof,

769
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:36,740
还是半开的
and it is partly open.

770
00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:38,209
那是我打开的
It is I who opened it.

771
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:43,894
Thaddeus Sholto先生 我有责任告诉你
Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, it is my duty to inform you

772
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:45,729
你所说的都会被记下
that anything you say will be taken down

773
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:47,710
可能会对你不利
and maybe used in evidence against you.

774
00:46:47,747 --> 00:46:49,528
为了你死去的哥哥
I arrest you in the Queen's name

775
00:46:49,565 --> 00:46:52,070
我代表政府逮捕你
as being concerned in the death of your brother.

776
00:46:53,565 --> 00:46:55,151
我没有 我说过了吧
I didn't I tell you

777
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,800
别着急 Sholto
Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Sholto.

778
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:00,462
我能帮你洗刷一切罪名
I think that I can engage

779
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:03,987
不要随便答应 大理论家
to clear you of this charge.

780
00:47:01,633 --> 00:47:04,549
Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist.

781
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:07,412
事实恐怕没你想的那么简单
You may find it a harder matter than you think.

782
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,187
我不但要为他澄清
Not only will I clear Mr. Sholto,

783
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:11,122
还要给你一些信息
but I will give you a description

784
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:13,681
昨晚有两个人来这个屋里
of the 2 men who were in this room last night.

785
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,565
其中一个文化程度很低
One was a poorly educated man,

786
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:16,785
强壮
strong,

787
00:47:16,821 --> 00:47:17,608
动作灵活
active,

788
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:19,134
没有右腿
with his right leg off,

789
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:21,150
装了一条木腿
wearing a stump worn away on the inside.

790
00:47:21,649 --> 00:47:24,994
左脚的靴子下面 有一块粗糙的方形前掌
His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole

791
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:28,103
后跟上钉着铁掌
it has an iron band around the heel.

792
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:31,447
是个中年人 晒得很黑
He's much sunburned, middle-aged

793
00:47:31,484 --> 00:47:35,454
这从他手掌上剥落的皮就能看出来
and has a certain amount of skin missing

794
00:47:33,877 --> 00:47:36,164
from the palm of one hand.

795
00:47:35,491 --> 00:47:37,384
那另一个呢?
And the other one?

796
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,695
另一个更加扑朔迷离
He's rather a curious person.

797
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,118
我希望不久就能够
I hope before long to be able to

798
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:47,411
把他们介绍给你
introduce you to the pair of them.

799
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,875
华生 去Pinchin巷3号
<i>Watson, go to 3</i> <i>Pinchin Lane, London</i>

800
00:47:58,913 --> 00:48:00,519
把Toby带来
<i>and ask for Toby.</i>

801
00:48:00,556 --> 00:48:02,229
我宁愿要Toby的帮忙
<i>I'd rather have</i> <i>Toby's help</i>

802
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:04,689
比全伦敦的警察都得力

我把它放在屋里

谢谢你 Bernstone夫人
Oh thank you Mrs. Bernstone.

864
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:29,436
你闻到木榴油的味儿了吗?
Do you smell the creosote?

865
00:52:30,227 --> 00:52:32,739
Athelney Jones不仅逮捕了Thaddeus
Athelney Jones arrested not only Thaddeus

866

00:52:35,787 --> 00:52:36,992
管家

868
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,285

我很幸运逃过一劫
I was lucky to escape myself.

870
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,255
华生 你能长途跋涉吗?
Watson are you on for a bit of a trudge?

871
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:43,897
当然
Of course.

872
00:52:50,331 --> 00:52:52,951
你和Toby比一比 顺着他们来的路
You and Toby game as they come

873
00:52:52,987 --> 00:52:54,991
它嗅觉很好使
when it's a good holding scent.

874
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,727
找到他们
Now find him.

875
00:52:56,764 --> 00:52:57,594
去 Toby
Go Toby.

876
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,329
走吧 Toby 快走
Seek Toby seek.

877
00:53:16,074 --> 00:53:18,116
稳住 华生 稳住
Steady Watson steady.

878
00:53:30,881 --> 00:53:32,326
幸好昨晚雨停了
Lucky the rain has stopped.

879
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,828
虽然隔了挺久
The scent will lie on the road

880
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:36,538
但气味儿还留在路上
in spite of their start.

881
00:53:42,503 --> 00:53:44,840
早上的空气真新鲜
Ah, how sweet the morning air is.

882
00:53:48,304 --> 00:53:49,796
带手枪了吗 华生?
Have you brought your pistol Watson?

883
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:51,388
没有 我带着手杖
No I have my stick.

884
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:53,014
要是遇上他们
In the event were led to the men

885
00:53:53,052 --> 00:53:54,547
带假腿的就留给你了
the peg leg I'll leave to you.

886
00:53:54,584 --> 00:53:56,855
那个同伙我来应付
Leave the ally to me come.

887
00:54:09,852 --> 00:54:11,873
这狗是怎么了?
What the deuce is the matter with the dog?

888
00:54:27,645 --> 00:54:29,582
他们坐船走了
They took a boat

889
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:32,984
至少没有坐马车或是氢气球
except they didn't take a cab or a balloon.

890
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:35,517
他们一定是在码头会面
They must have been met at the waters edge.

891
00:54:40,647 --> 00:54:41,672
Toby!
Toby!

892
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:43,961
Toby!
Toby!

893
00:54:45,272 --> 00:54:47,066
Toby!
Toby!

894
00:54:57,426 --> 00:54:58,772
Toby!
Toby!

895
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,968
Toby!
Toby!

896
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,959
毫无差错的Toby也出了错
He's lost his character to infallibility.

897
00:55:12,997 --> 00:55:13,818
不 不 不
No, no, no.

898
00:55:13,855 --> 00:55:15,193
这不怪Toby
Toby's not to blame.

899
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,288
这些桶里装满了木榴油
Those barrels are filled with creosote.

900
00:55:21,325 --> 00:55:23,356
气味儿把它引到这儿来了
The scent was divided.

901
00:55:23,394 --> 00:55:25,424
这和打猎一样 华生
So like good huntsmen Watson.

902
00:55:25,461 --> 00:55:27,057
我们得带着狗再走一遍
We must cast the dog again

903
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:28,641
找到正确的路
and find the true one.

904
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:30,601
Toby
Toby

905
00:55:31,631 --> 00:55:33,192
Toby
Toby

906
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,770
我们今天不走运
We're out of luck.

907
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,230
他们从这里坐的船
They've taken the boat from here.

908
00:55:53,127 --> 00:55:56,425
这些人比我想的聪明
These people are cleverer than I thought.

909
00:55:56,463 --> 00:56:00,763
华生 这些人事先有所准备
Now Watson these people show

910
00:55:59,512 --> 00:56:02,286
preconcerted management here.

911
00:56:06,085 --> 00:56:08,385
Mordecai Smith (小船出租 可按时或按日计费)
Mordecai Smith.

912
00:56:09,644 --> 00:56:12,003
回来 洗洗脸
You come back here and get your face washed.

913
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,886
Jack?
Jack?

914
00:56:12,924 --> 00:56:14,204
你这小鬼
Oh you youngin'.

915
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:15,548
你爸爸回来以后
I'll get your Dad to give you a good spankin'

916
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:17,046
又要打你屁股了
when he gets back.

917
00:56:18,657 --> 00:56:22,004
真是个红脸的小淘气!
My what a rosy-cheeked young rascal!

918
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,646
你想要什么东西吗 Jack?
Is there anything you'd like Jack?

919
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:25,525
我想要一个先令
I'd like a shillin'.

920
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,862
他真是个好孩子 Smith太太
A fine young lad you got there, Mrs. Smith.

921
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,872
上帝保佑你 他一直是这样
Lor' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward.

922
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:39,646
我简直管不了他
He gets a'most too much for me to manage,

923
00:56:39,683 --> 00:56:43,172
尤其是他爹不在的时候
'specially when my man is away days at a time.

924
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,412
太不巧了
Awe it's a pity about that.

925
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:46,344
我还想租只船呢
I was hoping to hire a boat from him,

926
00:56:46,382 --> 00:56:47,081
一只汽艇
a steam launch.

927
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,783
哎呀 先生 他就是坐着那只汽艇走的
Why, bless you, sir,

928
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,369
我一点都不喜欢雇他的那人
it is in the steam launch that he has gone.

929
00:56:50,956 --> 00:56:53,066
Aye' didn't like the bloke who did the hire

930
00:56:53,406 --> 00:56:55,886
很粗鲁 装着条假腿
not at all, very rough, with a wooden leg,

931
00:56:55,924 --> 00:56:58,492
半夜来敲我们的窗户
come tappin' at our window

932
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:01,618
然后没和我交代一句就走了
in the middle of the night

933
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:02,151
and away they went without a word to me.

934
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:06,388
那个装着木腿的是一个人吗?
Now this man with the wooden leg, was he alone?

935
00:57:06,893 --> 00:57:09,851
也许他带着一只动物
Think he might have had an animal with him.

936
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:12,030
厄...一只狗?
A dog?

937
00:57:12,274 --> 00:57:13,943
不像是狗 先生
Didn't look like no dog to me sir.

938
00:57:13,981 --> 00:57:16,774
更像是在动物园能找到的动物
More like something that you find at the zoo.

939
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,177
和我说说汽艇的事
So tell me about the launch.

940
00:57:20,215 --> 00:57:21,878
绿底上有黄线的旧船
It's the old green bird with the yellow line.

941
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:22,795
不 不
Oh no, no, sir.

942
00:57:22,832 --> 00:57:24,772
"曙光"号新刷的油漆
The Aurora has just been fresh painted

943
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,230
黑底上有两条红线
black with a gold trim.

944
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:28,865
啊 没错 白色的烟囱
Awe yes, with a white funnel.

945
00:57:28,902 --> 00:57:30,962
不  黑色的烟囱
No sir black funnel.

946
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:33,221
当然
Awe yes of course.

947
00:57:33,258 --> 00:57:34,158
谢了  Smith夫人
Well thank you Mrs. Smith.

948
00:57:34,196 --> 00:57:35,479
再见  Jack
Goodbye Jack.

949
00:57:35,516 --> 00:57:36,797
再见
Bye.

950
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:46,198
跟这种人说话关键的就是
The main thing with people of that sort

951
00:57:46,235 --> 00:57:49,616
不要让他们知道 他们的话与你有关
is never to let them think that information

952
00:57:49,653 --> 00:57:53,322
否则的话 他们马上就会三缄其口
is of the slightest importance to you.

953
00:57:50,191 --> 00:57:52,206
If you do they will instantly

954
00:57:52,313 --> 00:57:56,415
shut up like an oyster.

955
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:57,675
我们的线索看上去清楚了

956
00:57:57,713 --> 00:57:59,348
你会怎么办呢
Well our course seems pretty clear now.

957
00:57:59,384 --> 00:58:01,592
追踪"曙光"号
What would you do, then?

958
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:06,478
查找这里和Greenwich之间的 每一个码头和卸货地点要花好几天时间
Get on the track of the Aurora.

959
00:58:02,575 --> 00:58:04,306
It would take days if not months

960
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:05,696
to search every wharf and landing place

961
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,011
你打算怎么办?
on the harbor between here and Greenwich.

962
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,545
既然嫌疑人以为 我们找不到他们
What do you propose?

963

换句话说 动用非常手段

要是他再来个灵机一动
I wouldn't answer for our safety now

987
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:31,812
我们也可能被认作凶手
if he has another of his attacks of energy.

988
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:43,222
福尔摩斯先生没说起过此事
Mr Holmes said nothing of this.

989
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:47,881

找到船的孩子多给一个几尼

这是预付给你们一天的工钱

这些非正规军就能找到她

1015

他们无处不到 一切都逃过他们的眼睛
They can go everywhere, see everything.

1016

咱们这个问题看来不难解决
If our man had an easy task

另一个人也很特殊
One-legged men are not so common

1019
01:01:23,688 --> 01:01:25,738
and this other man must be unique.

1020
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:30,157
安达曼群岛的土著居民
The aborigines of the Andaman Islands

1021
01:01:30,194 --> 01:01:31,481
或许可以称得上是
may perhaps claim the distinction

1022
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,400
世界最矮小的种族了

他们生性凶猛 怪癖 难以交往
They are a fierce, morose,

1024
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,031
但如果得到他们的信任

1025
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:41,841
though capable of forming

1026
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:45,107
他们会成为至死不渝的朋友
the most devoted friendships

1027
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,942
when their confidence has once been gained.

1028
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:49,901
对于船只的遇难水手来说 他们永远是个祸害
They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews,

1029
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:54,058
往往被他们用绑着石头的木棒击碎脑袋
braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs

1030
01:01:54,095 --> 01:01:56,717
或是用...
or shooting them with

1031
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:02,043
用毒箭刺死
with poisoned arrows.

1032

将人肉作为盛宴
by a cannibal feast.

1034
01:02:14,976 --> 01:02:19,147
这真是一群"和善"的人啊
Nice, amiable people.

1035
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:38,537
什么时候吃晚饭 福尔摩斯先生?
And what time would you like for dinner Mr. Holmes?

后天8点半
Half past eight the day after tomorrow.

1037
01:02:52,607 --> 01:02:53,791
你会撑不住的
You'll wear yourself out old man.

1038
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:55,678
我听见你整晚上都踱来踱去的
I heard you marching about all night.

1039
01:02:56,688 --> 01:02:58,629
你真的需要些休息了
You really must get some rest.

1040
01:02:58,667 --> 01:02:59,866
我睡不着
I can't sleep.

1041
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:02,508
这个恶魔似的问题一直困扰着我
This infernal problem is consuming me.

1042
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:03,924
没有消息?
No news?

1043
01:03:04,262 --> 01:03:06,721
没有 什么都没有
None.

1044
01:03:06,759 --> 01:03:08,791
河的两岸都搜过了
None whatsoever.

1045
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,422
Smith夫人也没有他丈夫的消息
The whole river has been searched from both sides.

1046
01:03:10,461 --> 01:03:14,750
其他的问题都解决了
Mrs. Smith has not heard from her husband,

1047
01:03:10,783 --> 01:03:12,928
it's too much.

1048
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:15,058
To be balked by some petty obstacle

1049
01:03:14,787 --> 01:03:17,035
就是这个问题一直阻碍着我们
when all else has been overcome.

1050
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,542
看见什么了吗?
See anything?

1051
01:03:49,883 --> 01:03:51,510
什么都没有
No nothing.

1052
01:04:22,842 --> 01:04:26,180
快下船 否则我就要来赶你了!
Shove off.

1053
01:04:24,905 --> 01:04:27,999
Or you'll feel the back of my hand.

1054
01:04:30,626 --> 01:04:34,340
"曙光"号

1055
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:45,101
我不想再说一遍了 孩子
I'm not going to tell you again boy.

1056
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:22,286
多漂亮的一搜小船
A nice little craft.

1057
01:05:23,271 --> 01:05:24,613
是条不错的船
Aye, she's a good boat this.

1058
01:05:24,651 --> 01:05:26,955

We built her right in this yard.

在河里行得最快的船
Fastest boat on the river.

1060
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:30,811
为什么停进来?
What she in for?

1061
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,393
维修一下方向舵
Repairs to her rudder.

1062
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,819
这是惯例
That's the order.

1063
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:35,826
在它身上找不到任何差错
I can't find anything amiss with it.

1064
01:05:35,863 --> 01:05:40,162
今晚六点我们的船要出坞了
I want her in the water

1065
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:41,035
by six o'clock tonight.

1066
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:43,965
加满煤 全速前进
Fully coaled and steam up.

1067
01:05:44,002 --> 01:05:45,081
Smith先生 准备好了
Right Mr. Smith she'll be ready.

1068
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:49,126

01:05:47,132 --> 01:05:49,633
Six o'clock sharp, mind,

好的
Right.

就是这个诺伍德案 医生

总是有些麻烦困扰着我
I have a great deal to worry and try me.

1074
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:06,143
这桩案子就是之一
And this case is a very dark one too.

1075
01:06:06,962 --> 01:06:07,628
谢谢
Thank you.

1076
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:10,679
我很感激福尔摩斯先生的帮助

1077
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:11,987
你的朋友是个好人
Your friend is a wonderful man

1078
01:06:12,025 --> 01:06:13,438
谁也比不上他
and not to be beat.

1079
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:17,838
也许你要等很长时间
Well you maybe in for a long wait.

1080
01:06:17,876 --> 01:06:20,267
我不这么想
Nope I don't think so.

1081
01:06:21,613 --> 01:06:23,527
"马上去贝克街
Go to Baker Street at once.

1082

"要是我没回来 等着我
If I've not returned, wait for me.

1083

"我已找到Sholto案匪徒的踪迹
I am close on the track of the Sholto gang.

1084

Come with us tonight

1085
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:31,437
"今晚和我们同去"
if you want to be in at the kill.

1086
01:06:31,473 --> 01:06:36,516
不错 他又找到线索了
Good.

1087
01:06:33,566 --> 01:06:36,826
So he's on the scent again?

1088
01:06:36,555 --> 01:06:39,283
之前他也查错了方向?
He's been at fault too has he?

1089
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,611
我们最好的侦探专家 有时也难免被人甩了
Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes.

1090
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:50,470
-什么事? -夏洛克 福尔摩斯?

1091
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:53,341

Sherlock Holmes?

1092
01:06:51,062 --> 01:06:51,677
What is it?

1093
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:53,901
Are you Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

1094
01:06:53,379 --> 01:06:55,606
不 但是我可以代表他

1095
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:58,427
我是为这个到这里来
I've come about this right here.

1096
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,987
要是你有什么事 你可以和我说
If you have any information

1097
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:07,231
-这个酬金... -是关于汽艇"曙光"号的吗?
you may give to me.

1098
01:07:03,444 --> 01:07:04,758
There's a reward.

1099
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,786
Is it about the steam launch, Aurora?

1100
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:09,246
我只跟夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生说
I'm telling no one but Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

1101
01:07:09,283 --> 01:07:11,421
别走 进来
No, no; come inside.

1102

1104
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,045
我们会补偿你的

1105
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:21,194

不会等太久的 坐下
You will not have long to wait.

1107
01:07:23,652 --> 01:07:25,939
Sit down.

1108
01:07:25,323 --> 01:07:26,931
要雪茄吗 Jones先生?

谢谢
Oh, thank you for you very much.

1110

As I was saying Doctor,

他本可以成为最有前途的警官
He would have made

1114
01:07:45,045 --> 01:07:46,820
这话我可以当着任何人讲
the most promising police officer.

1115
01:07:46,856 --> 01:07:49,653
只要稍微循规蹈矩一点
I don't care who knows it.

1116
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,938
With a little more discipline

1117
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,885
别死抱着理论不放
and a lot less theory.

1118
01:07:51,923 --> 01:07:53,009
谢谢
Thank you.

1119

你或许可以给我提供机会
You might offer me one.

1120
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:03,023
你这坏蛋
Oh, you rogue

1121
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:05,242
你可以去做演员了
you would have made an actor

1122
01:08:05,279 --> 01:08:06,368
出色的演员
and a rare one.

1123
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:09,398
咳嗽声惟妙惟肖
You had the proper workhouse cough,

1124
01:08:09,435 --> 01:08:11,123
两条弱不禁风的腿
and those weak legs of yours

1125
01:08:11,161 --> 01:08:12,450
上台表演能挣10英镑了
there worth 1 0 pounds each.

1126
01:08:12,487 --> 01:08:15,100
我能胜任警官的职位 您太过奖了
A police officer, I'm flattered.

1127
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:17,802
Jones 我要一只警用汽艇
Jones I shall need a police launch

1128
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,320
在威斯敏斯特待命
at the Westminster steps.

1129
01:08:19,357 --> 01:08:20,320
最快的那种
The fastest you have.

1130
01:08:20,358 --> 01:08:22,288
还有两位健壮的警察  你  我
2 stout men, yourself, myself,

1131
01:08:22,326 --> 01:08:24,222
还有华生 都要有武器
Watson all of us armed.

1132
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,092
这容易安排
That is easily arranged.

1133
01:08:25,129 --> 01:08:27,263
我给当地警局打电话
I will telephone the local station.

1134
01:08:37,537 --> 01:08:39,217
到伦敦塔的时候
When we get to the tower

1135
01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:41,963
把船停在Jacobson船坞的对面
we'll stop opposite of Jacobson's Yard.

1136
01:08:53,845 --> 01:08:55,576
你是怎么找到"曙光"号的?
How did you find the Aurora then?

1137
01:08:55,613 --> 01:08:58,168
我有理由相信汽艇就在不远处
Well I have reasons that the launch couldn't be

1138
01:08:58,205 --> 01:08:59,353
虽然我们看不见它
far often despite of its invisibility.

1139
01:08:59,391 --> 01:09:02,363
所以 先生们 它会在哪里?
So gentlemen, where could it be?

1140
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:05,248
我猜肯定不在水上
Well out of the water I suppose.

1141
01:09:05,284 --> 01:09:07,231
在船坞里小做修整
In a repair or boat builders yard.

1142
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,005
非常正确
Exactly.

1143
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:32,718
一个孩子正在那里等着
One of my boys is waiting by the yard

1144
01:09:32,754 --> 01:09:34,084
他会给我们信号
to give us the signal.

1145
01:09:34,122 --> 01:09:36,275
你的计划非常周密 福尔摩斯先生
You planned it all very neatly Mr. Holmes

1146
01:09:36,312 --> 01:09:38,944
不过要由我处理这件事
but if the affair were in my hands

1147
01:09:38,982 --> 01:09:41,144
我一定派出一对能干的警察
I should have a body of police in the yard

1148
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:43,077
等他们来了把他们都逮捕了
and arrested them when they came down.

1149
01:09:43,115 --> 01:09:44,496
那绝不可能
Which would have been never.

1150
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:48,065
那个叫Small的人很精明
This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow.

1151
01:09:48,507 --> 01:09:49,772
如有可疑情况
Anything suspicious

1152
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,417
他可能会再躲一个星期
and he would lie snug for another week.

1153
01:09:53,976 --> 01:09:55,067
先生?
Sir?

1154
01:09:55,104 --> 01:09:57,111
我们已经到了Jacobson船坞的对面
We're opposite Jacobson's Yard now,

1155
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:58,831
要靠近一些吗
shall we move downstream a little.

1156
01:09:58,868 --> 01:10:02,724
不用 雾气会掩护我们
No this mist may be of an advantage to us.

1157
01:10:02,761 --> 01:10:05,579
我们下去等着
We must lie low and wait.

1158
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,051
你的男孩发信号了
Your boy's signaling,

1159
01:10:35,089 --> 01:10:37,233
我看得很清楚
I can see it plainly.

1160
01:10:54,636 --> 01:10:56,447
那就是"曙光"号
There's the Aurora

1161
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,482
像艘鬼船
going like the devil

1162
01:10:58,659 --> 01:11:00,308
她太快了
She's very fast.

1163
01:11:00,345 --> 01:11:01,813
我猜我们追不上她
I doubt if we shall catch her.

1164
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,421
我们必须追上她!
We must catch her!

1165
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,481
火夫 赶紧加煤!
Pile it on, stokers!

1166
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:07,288
要是我们追不上她
I'll never forgive myself

1167
01:11:07,325 --> 01:11:09,454
我永远不能原谅自己
if she proves to have some use.

1168
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:17,071
再快点 再快点
Faster, faster.

1169
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,746
这已经是我们的极限了
This is the fast boat they've got.

1170
01:11:47,091 --> 01:11:49,402
快加煤 火夫!
Pile on the coals.

1171
01:11:50,103 --> 01:11:52,045
一定要追上
Stoke her.

1172
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,920
就算把船烧了
We must have her.

1173
01:11:52,802 --> 01:11:54,912
Even if we burn the boat.

1174
01:12:26,815 --> 01:12:28,468
灯照别太晃
Keep the light steady.

1175
01:12:28,506 --> 01:12:30,719
我几乎看清他的同伙了
I can almost make out his companion.

1176
01:13:21,677 --> 01:13:23,125
我们快追上了
We're gaining.

1177
01:13:38,855 --> 01:13:40,195
火夫 赶紧加煤!
Pile it on, stoker.

1178
01:13:40,234 --> 01:13:42,458
全速前进
Give it all the steam we've got.

1179
01:13:44,095 --> 01:13:46,448
我们赶上了一些
I think we gained a little.

1180
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:50,275
我一定以及肯定
I'm sure of it.

1181
01:13:49,706 --> 01:13:51,020
Absolutely.

1182
01:14:02,891 --> 01:14:05,224
把灯向左边照照
Point the light more to the left.

1183
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:14,971
稳住
Keep it steady.

1184
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:55,895
那艘船怎么了?
What's happening on that boat?

1185
01:14:59,254 --> 01:15:01,388
他们自己打起来了
They're fighting among themselves.

1186
01:15:01,426 --> 01:15:02,380
Tonga
Tonga,

1187
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:03,972
Tonga
Tonga.

1188
01:15:08,522 --> 01:15:10,076
那个木腿人
The peg leg.

1189
01:15:10,226 --> 01:15:11,512
停船!
Stop!

1190
01:15:11,926 --> 01:15:13,329
我们是警察!
Police!

1191
01:15:13,684 --> 01:15:15,054
快停下!
Cease you.

1192
01:15:15,505 --> 01:15:18,921
你们下地狱吧!
You can burn in hell

1193
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,557
停下!
Stop!

1194
01:15:21,593 --> 01:15:25,843
四签名
The sign of four

1195
01:15:26,763 --> 01:15:29,357
华生 看
Watson look.

1196
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:46,922
多可怕的脸
What a face.

1197
01:17:59,078 --> 01:18:00,368
等等
Wait

1198
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,570
等等
Wait.

1199
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:06,347
等他筋疲力尽了再说
Let him wear himself out.

1200
01:18:57,161 --> 01:18:59,661
Jonathan Small
So Jonathan Small.

1201
01:19:00,886 --> 01:19:02,838
抱歉 事情变成这样
I am sorry it's come to this.

1202
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:06,053
我也一样
And so am I sir.

1203
01:19:07,296 --> 01:19:09,338
但是我发誓 先生们
But I give you my word gentlemen

1204
01:19:09,884 --> 01:19:12,364
我没有对小Sholto先生下手
I never laid hands on young Mr. Sholto.

1205
01:19:12,403 --> 01:19:14,087
你当然没有
Of course you didn't.

1206
01:19:14,123 --> 01:19:15,883
你那个小朋友杀了他
Your little friends dart killed him

1207
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,243
就在你还在爬绳子的时候
while he was still climbing the rope.

1208
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:28,530
你说这话就好像你亲眼见过一样
Well you speak as if you were there sir.

1209
01:19:41,346 --> 01:19:44,461
要是那是老Sholto少校的话
Well if it had been old Major Sholto

1210
01:19:44,499 --> 01:19:49,141
我绝对会毫不手软地掐死他
I would have swung for him with a light heart.

1211
01:19:49,636 --> 01:19:52,496
现在竟然因为小Sholto而入狱
But to be lagged over this young Sholto,

1212
01:19:55,127 --> 01:19:56,775
真令人心痛
cursed heart.

1213
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:59,978
如果你能向我句句属实
You must make a clean breast of it

1214
01:20:00,321 --> 01:20:02,364
我还能帮你的忙
if you do I may be of use to you.

1215
01:20:04,186 --> 01:20:06,567
真像是一家人团圆
Quite a family party.

1216
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:10,061
我想这瓶酒该留给我自己
I reckon I'll pull that flask myself.

1217
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:17,539
好了 你准备去哪儿 Small?
Now, where are you going Small?

1218
01:20:18,082 --> 01:20:20,830
Gravesend的Esmeralda
The Esmeralda, at Gravesend,

1219
01:20:20,868 --> 01:20:22,853
转道去巴西
outward bound for the Brazils.

1220
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,323
几乎就成功了
And nearly made it.

1221
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:26,430
如果当时还有别人驾驶的话
Another man at the engines

1222
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:28,176
你们永远都追不上我们
and you'd never have caught us.

1223
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,937
钥匙在哪?
Where's the key my man?

1224
01:20:34,015 --> 01:20:36,720
河底
At the bottom of the river.

1225
01:20:38,188 --> 01:20:40,008
瞧
Now look here,

1226
01:20:40,046 --> 01:20:41,842
今天你给我们带来了不少麻烦 Small
we've had enough of you tonight Small.

1227
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,695
把手铐带进来 我警告你
Bring the cuffs in men, I'm warning you.

1228
01:20:43,732 --> 01:20:45,400
没事了 警官
Its alright constable

1229
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:47,548
不必拿手铐来了
When we leave the stacks.

1230
01:20:47,957 --> 01:20:50,354
我建议我们回贝克街
I suggest that we go back to Baker Street.

1231
01:20:50,391 --> 01:20:52,804
我想Morstan小姐在那
Well I think Miss Morstan should be there.

1232
01:20:52,841 --> 01:20:56,156
这不合乎规矩 福尔摩斯先生
Well that's not the regulation way Mr. Holmes.

1233
01:20:56,193 --> 01:20:59,221
至少我可以请你喝上一杯
Well I can at least promise you a nice,

1234
01:20:59,259 --> 01:21:02,196
温暖又美味
warming drink.

1235
01:21:03,876 --> 01:21:05,548
很好 各位
Very well gentlemen.

1236
01:21:13,252 --> 01:21:14,445
Morstan小姐
Well Miss Morstan

1237
01:21:14,987 --> 01:21:17,094
我很荣幸能将
I am pleased and proud

1238
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:21,266
这个贼绳之以法
to have been able to bring the thief to justice.

1239
01:21:21,352 --> 01:21:24,270
正义!
Justice?

1240
01:21:24,308 --> 01:21:26,584
多好听的正义啊
The pretty justice.

1241
01:21:26,963 --> 01:21:30,050
这财宝不是我们的 还能属于谁?
Who's loot is this if it is not ours?

1242
01:21:30,088 --> 01:21:33,183
财宝不是他们的 却偏要给他们
Where is the justice that I should give it up

1243
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,170
这就是正义?
to those who have never owned it?

1244
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,123
你忘记了 Small
You forget Small

1245
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,104
他们一无所知
they know nothing of this matter.

1246
01:21:38,562 --> 01:21:39,447
判断不出
We cannot tell how far justice

1247
01:21:39,484 --> 01:21:44,165
正义是否在你一边

1248
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:45,670
may have originally been on your side.

1249
01:21:49,646 --> 01:21:51,345
对 先生
No sir.

1250
01:21:52,269 --> 01:21:55,577
您说话还算公道
You have been fair spoken to me,

1251
01:21:56,489 --> 01:21:58,043
虽然说我该感谢你
though I can say that it's you

1252
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:00,768
给我的双手
that I have to thank

1253
01:22:00,806 --> 01:22:04,629
戴上了手铐
for these bracelets on my wrists.

1254
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,633
可我并不怨恨
Still I bear no grudge for that.

1255
01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:11,969
要是您想听我的故事
If you want to hear my story

1256
01:22:12,007 --> 01:22:14,627
我不会隐瞒
I have no wish to hold it back.

1257
01:22:14,665 --> 01:22:16,407
我所说之言
And what I say to you is God's truth,

1258
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:20,254
句句都是真话

1259
01:22:19,178 --> 01:22:21,293
every word of it.

1260
01:22:39,471 --> 01:22:41,354
当我还是个小伙子
When I was a lad

1261
01:22:41,803 --> 01:22:43,921
参军当了兵
I took the Queen's shilling and was

1262
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:47,597
跟随步兵三团去了印度
posted out to India with the Third Buff's.

1263
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:54,110
当我在恒河里游泳的时候
A crocodile snapped this off

1264
01:22:54,147 --> 01:22:56,926
一只鳄鱼咬掉了我的腿
when I was bathing in the Ganges.

1265
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:05,763
那畜生像做外科手术一样 干脆地咬掉了我这只腿
The sawbones had my stump

1266
01:23:03,524 --> 01:23:06,721
in the tar barrel nice and quick.

1267
01:23:06,134 --> 01:23:08,568
我那时还年盛体强
I was young and strong.

1268
01:23:10,267 --> 01:23:12,263
我奉命退伍
We got my discharge and this fellow...

1269
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:23,239
而这个家伙....支撑着我

1270
01:23:20,536 --> 01:23:23,661
it's been a good support to me

1271
01:23:25,629 --> 01:23:28,900
于是我20岁就成了瘸子
so there I was a cripple at 20.

1272
01:23:29,657 --> 01:23:31,774
但是我喜欢那里
But I liked it out there

1273
01:23:32,356 --> 01:23:34,578
我在那找了一个监工的工作
so I found myself a job as an overseer

1274
01:23:34,615 --> 01:23:36,900
在一个经营靛青的农场里
on an Indigo farm.

1275
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:40,967
我每天都骑在马背上 所以境遇还不错
I was on horseback all day so that was fine.

1276
01:23:42,558 --> 01:23:45,364
但是好景不长
But I was never in luck for long,

1277
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:47,655
事前没有一点征兆
without a note of warning

1278
01:23:47,692 --> 01:23:49,929
大叛乱爆发了
the great mutiny was on us.

1279
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,114
一天晚上我回到农场
I came back to the farm one evening to find

1280
01:23:52,151 --> 01:23:55,531
发现我的雇主和所有的人都被杀了
my master and all his family be murdered.

1281
01:23:56,707 --> 01:23:58,573
我没有等待
I didn't wait.

1282
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:01,832
连夜跑到Agra城
On that same evening I was in the Fort of Agra,

1283
01:24:01,869 --> 01:24:04,806
那是英国人控制着的最近的城市
the nearest city still held by the British.

1284
01:24:05,659 --> 01:24:07,680
古老的Agra城
The old Fort of Agra,

1285
01:24:07,717 --> 01:24:09,419
一个古怪的地方
a queer place,

1286
01:24:10,108 --> 01:24:11,859
很大
huge,

1287
01:24:12,523 --> 01:24:15,693
到处都是通道和房间
it's full of passages and rooms

1288
01:24:17,654 --> 01:24:20,715
更多的是出口 数也数不过来
and more entrances than you can count.

1289
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:23,839
有很多的门
There were many gates

1290
01:24:23,877 --> 01:24:25,638
由于我是一个退伍兵  还是英国人
and because I was an ex-soldier and British

1291
01:24:25,675 --> 01:24:27,367
他们让我当了一个头目
they put me in charge of one of them

1292
01:24:27,404 --> 01:24:28,715
还给我派了几个印度人
and gave me a couple of Sikkhs

1293
01:24:28,753 --> 01:24:30,629
他们对我们很忠诚

1294
01:24:31,227 --> 01:24:33,390
这是个偏僻的地方
who'd stayed loyal to us.

1295
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:34,956
It was a lonely place.

1296
01:24:34,454 --> 01:24:37,726
我手下的两个旁遮普人久经沙场
My 2 Punjabis were experienced, fighting men.

1297
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:43,291
Kartar Singh和Indigo Singh
Kartar Singh and Indigo Singh.

1298
01:24:54,408 --> 01:24:55,500
是叛军吗?
Rebels?

1299
01:24:55,538 --> 01:24:57,089
不是
No rebels.

1300
01:24:57,127 --> 01:24:59,154
堡垒很安全
The fort is safe.

1301
01:24:59,634 --> 01:25:02,963
河这边没有叛军士兵
There are no rebel this side of the river.

1302
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,923
你要不和我们合作
You must be with us

1303
01:25:05,961 --> 01:25:08,782
要不永远沉默
or you must be silenced forever.

1304
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:10,411
和你们合作干什么?
With you how?

1305
01:25:10,449 --> 01:25:12,843
我们让你发财
We want you to be rich,

1306
01:25:12,881 --> 01:25:16,011
不就是你们英国人来这的目的吗
which is why you British came to this land.

1307
01:25:17,444 --> 01:25:19,921
我没理由拒绝发财
Well I have no objection of being rich.

1308
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:23,731
以你父亲的身体发誓
Then swear by the bones of your father

1309
01:25:23,768 --> 01:25:24,917
今后绝不做不利于我们的事
to raise no hand

1310
01:25:24,956 --> 01:25:26,917
也不说不利于我们的话
and to speak no word against us now

1311
01:25:26,954 --> 01:25:30,212
永远都不
or ever afterwards

1312
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:34,040
你会拥有财宝的四分之一
then you will have quarter of the treasure.

1313
01:25:35,411 --> 01:25:37,304
但我们只有3个人
But there are only 3 of us.

1314
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,962
Jagodish Singh 我的同胞兄弟
Jagodish Singh my foster brother

1315
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:41,819
他也有一份
he must have his share.

1316
01:25:43,528 --> 01:25:48,780
没时间了 先生 决定吧
There is no time Sahib decide.

1317
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:50,500
好
Well

1318
01:25:50,537 --> 01:25:53,465
如果没有威胁到堡垒的安全
provided the fort is in no kind of danger

1319
01:25:54,387 --> 01:25:56,171
我发誓
I swear.

1320
01:25:58,104 --> 01:26:01,174
你会怎么做 福尔摩斯先生?
What would you have done Mr. Holmes?

1321
01:26:02,006 --> 01:26:03,113
我非常怀疑
I strongly suspect

1322
01:26:03,151 --> 01:26:05,353
我和你完全一样
I would have done exactly as you did.

1323
01:26:07,134 --> 01:26:09,390
我了解锡克人
Yes I know the Sikkh.

1324
01:26:09,703 --> 01:26:11,955
唬弄不了的人
He's not a man to be trifled with.

1325
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,903
我们那里的一个首长
One of our local Rajahs,

1326
01:26:18,505 --> 01:26:19,752
很有钱
Rich as Croesus of course,

1327
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:21,885
他投靠了叛军
he'd gone in with the rebels.

1328
01:26:21,922 --> 01:26:25,586
但是 他害怕万一英军再反扑回来
But... He wanted to hedge his bet

1329
01:26:25,623 --> 01:26:29,212
又留了后路
just in case the British came out on top.

1330
01:26:29,249 --> 01:26:32,421
他想出个办法 把财产分成2部分
So he made a plot to get half his treasure

1331
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:34,806
藏在Agra城里
hidden in the Fort of Agra

1332
01:26:35,764 --> 01:26:37,195
派他手下的人
sending one of his men with it

1333
01:26:37,232 --> 01:26:39,735
乔装成商人的样子
in the guise of a merchant

1334
01:26:39,773 --> 01:26:42,384
请Jagodish Singh
and Jagodish Singh

1335
01:26:42,422 --> 01:26:43,572
就是Kartar的哥哥
Kartar's brother

1336
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:45,928
来做向导
to be the guide.

1337
01:26:45,965 --> 01:26:49,027
他们冒着风险来
They come challenging sahib, in a major way

1338
01:26:49,065 --> 01:26:50,721
按照惯例问他 别吓着他
giving no caution to fear.

1339
01:26:50,758 --> 01:26:51,451
下一步怎么办?
What then?

1340
01:26:51,488 --> 01:26:53,155
我们都安排好了
we do what has to be done.

1341
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:07,456
谁?
Who goes there?

1342
01:27:07,493 --> 01:27:10,422
自己人 阁下
A friend sahib.

1343
01:27:10,461 --> 01:27:13,214
先验清楚
A friend advance and be recognized.

1344
01:27:17,373 --> 01:27:19,047
你拿的是什么?
What have you with you?

1345
01:27:19,084 --> 01:27:24,395
一个箱子 先生 旧箱子
A box sahib, old box.

1346
01:27:24,432 --> 01:27:27,228
一些祖传的东西
Having some family papers.

1347
01:27:27,266 --> 01:27:31,533
别人拿着不值钱 自己留着
No good to nobody sahib only for myself.

1348
01:27:41,267 --> 01:27:43,611
长官 我不是讨饭的穷人
Sahib, I'm no ordinary beggar.

1349
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:47,779
我会报答你的 先生
You will have money sahib.

1350
01:27:47,817 --> 01:27:50,195
还有你的同志们
and you comrades sahib also.

1351
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:57,615
把他带到总部去
Take him to the main guardroom.

1352
01:28:22,102 --> 01:28:26,223
他就这样被死神紧紧包围着
Never was a man more compassed round with death.

1353
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:01,562
要是他逃跑
If that man had escaped

1354
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,516
整个事情都会败露
the whole affair would have come out.

1355
01:29:03,552 --> 01:29:05,738
我会被枪决的
I should have been shot most like.

1356
01:29:08,379 --> 01:29:11,328
当时的情况下 你们哪个不会这么做?
Which of you would have held back his musket?

1357
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:17,253
Kartar要火化他
Kartar was for burning him,

1358
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:19,043
那是他们的宗教信仰
that's there religion.

1359
01:29:19,422 --> 01:29:21,448
但是点火是不可能的
But such a fire was impossible.

1360
01:29:22,276 --> 01:29:24,395
Jagodish要把他扔进
Jagodish was for throwing him down

1361
01:29:24,432 --> 01:29:25,927
堡垒下的深沟里
into the great ditch below the fort

1362
01:29:25,965 --> 01:29:28,249
下面的柴狗会把他吃干净
where the jackal's to clean him.

1363
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:30,598
毫无疑问他是对的
No doubt he was right.

1364
01:29:31,414 --> 01:29:34,668
我一向对死亡有些许的敬意
I'm always for showing some respect for the dead.

1365
01:29:35,522 --> 01:29:38,363
接着我们打开箱子
Then we turned to the box,

1366
01:29:39,738 --> 01:29:41,438
这个箱子
this box.

1367
01:29:45,846 --> 01:29:47,641
里面的珍宝
Inside were more gems

1368
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,704
我做梦都想不到

1369
01:29:57,471 --> 01:30:01,074
143颗上等钻石
A 1 43 diamonds of the first order

1370
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:03,555
其中一颗叫做"大莫卧儿"

1371
01:30:03,593 --> 01:30:06,623
世界上第二大钻石
the second largest stone in existence.

1372
01:30:06,904 --> 01:30:09,263
97块翡翠
97 emeralds,

1375
01:30:14,473 --> 01:30:16,550
61块玛瑙

1376
01:30:21,218 --> 01:30:23,424
Jagodish是对的
Jagodish was right,

1377
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:28,721
你们这么把他埋了是错误的
it was a great mistake you made

1378
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:29,755
burying the body as you did

1379
01:30:29,224 --> 01:30:31,361
你说是吗 华生?
would you not say so Watson?

1380
01:30:32,265 --> 01:30:33,576
确实
Yes indeed.

1381
01:30:33,613 --> 01:30:35,898
尸体在印度没被火化的话
Bodies not burned in India

1382
01:30:35,937 --> 01:30:37,228
不久就会被发现
are soon discovered.

1383
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:38,982
于是你和你的三个同谋
So you and your 3 companions

1384
01:30:39,019 --> 01:30:42,491
被起诉有罪 被叛终身监禁
were found guilty and sent away for life

1385
01:30:42,528 --> 01:30:45,374
在安达曼群岛
to the penal colony in the Andaman Islands.

1386
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:47,747
布莱尔岛
Blair Island sir.

1387
01:30:47,785 --> 01:30:50,380
希望之城
Hopetown,

1388
01:30:50,899 --> 01:30:54,217
没有什么地方的名字比那儿更糟了
never was a place worse named.

1389
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,049
那是一个苦力之地
It was a place to sweat.

1390
01:31:10,412 --> 01:31:12,814
一个腐朽之地
A place to rot.

1391
01:31:12,852 --> 01:31:15,420
一个死亡之地
A place to die.

1392
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:19,132
我在那里年复一年的做劳力
And I sweated there year after year

1393
01:31:19,169 --> 01:31:22,509
直到你父亲的到来  Morstan小姐
until your father arrived Miss. Morstan.

1394
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:25,317
下士!
corporal!

1395
01:31:25,747 --> 01:31:29,294
你不能虐待白人囚犯
you will not maltreat the white prisoner.

1396
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:32,658
要是再有一次 你就等着受罚吧
If it happens again

1397
01:31:31,745 --> 01:31:33,729
you'll be court marshaled.

1398
01:31:36,694 --> 01:31:38,465
他是我们的行政长官
He was our administrative officer and he gave me

1399
01:31:38,502 --> 01:31:42,434
他在诊疗所给了我一个简易的小屋
a nice cushy villa in the dispensary.

1400
01:31:43,011 --> 01:31:45,152
他是我曾经遇到的
He was as good and kind a Christian gentleman

1401
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:47,666
最善良基督信徒了
as I ever come across

01:31:48,189 --> 01:31:50,315
我对他没有半点怨恨
and I hold no grudge against him.

1403
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:54,328
你也是 小姐
Or you Miss.

谢谢 Small先生
Thank you Mr. Small.

1405
01:32:18,673 --> 01:32:21,524
我坐在这儿 想那些财宝的时候
Well as I sat thinking about the treasure

1406
01:32:21,562 --> 01:32:25,494
我仿佛看见那所有的长官
I could see all the offices and the prison officials

1407
01:32:25,531 --> 01:32:27,692
喝酒 赌博的场景
at their drinking and their gambling.

1408
01:32:29,763 --> 01:32:32,361
Sholto少校从来运气都不好
Major Sholto never had much luck.

1409
01:32:32,859 --> 01:32:35,695
每晚他都输
Night after night he was the loser.

1410
01:32:37,598 --> 01:32:39,999
有些人天生如此
Some people are born like that.

1411
01:32:40,037 --> 01:32:42,222
我输光了 Morstan
It's all over for me Morstan.

1412
01:32:42,259 --> 01:32:44,129
我完了
I'm ruined.

1413
01:32:44,165 --> 01:32:46,909
我得辞职了
I shall have to send in my paper.

1414
01:32:48,143 --> 01:32:51,649
我想你没法再弄到几百块了?
I don't suppose you could manage

1415
01:32:52,346 --> 01:32:56,076
我有自己的烦恼
another couple of hundred hey?

1416
01:32:53,322 --> 01:32:56,482
I had a pretty nasty face in myself

1417
01:32:56,114 --> 01:32:58,610
我有个女儿要抚养
and I have a daughter back home to support.

1418
01:32:58,647 --> 01:33:03,231
我也有两个儿子要养活
Well I've got 2 wretched sons.

1419
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:04,586
完蛋了
Ruined hey, damn pity.

1420
01:33:07,308 --> 01:33:13,453
所以你决定要接近你的恩人Morstan上尉?
So you decided to approach your benefactor

1421
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:15,864
他经常在诊疗所里
Captain Morstan?

1422
01:33:14,205 --> 01:33:16,225
He was often in the dispensary.

1423
01:33:15,902 --> 01:33:18,229
热带的气候不适合他
The tropical climate didn't agree with him.

1424
01:33:18,733 --> 01:33:19,775
他心脏很弱
His heart was weak

1425
01:33:19,811 --> 01:33:21,887
全身血液中毒
and his blood was all poisoned.

1426
01:33:22,043 --> 01:33:27,586
知道他会把他所有的安排 都告诉了他的朋友Sholto少校?
Knowing that he would wish to share

1427
01:33:24,384 --> 01:33:25,915
any arrangement with his friend

1428
01:33:26,023 --> 01:33:28,244
the officer in command, Major Sholto?

1429
01:33:27,623 --> 01:33:30,243
是的 那看上去是最安全的方式
Yes sir it seemed the safest way.

1430
01:33:30,282 --> 01:33:31,995
这是你个人的私事
And is there any private concern over which

1431
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:37,144
你当然有权按你的方式来处理它们
of course you have the power of disposing

1432
01:33:35,784 --> 01:33:40,513
as you think best

1433
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:41,657
谢谢你的忠告
Thank you for that advice sir.

1434
01:33:41,694 --> 01:33:43,478
非常感谢
Thank you indeed

1435
01:33:43,936 --> 01:33:45,219
但事实是
but the fact is

1436
01:33:45,256 --> 01:33:47,885
我在这种环境下
being in the position I am

1437
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,586
我需要帮助
I need help.

1438
01:33:50,623 --> 01:33:51,951
哪种帮助
What sort of help?

1439
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:55,042
我要一个同伴
I need a partner.

1440
01:33:56,781 --> 01:34:01,957
我想Sholto少校和我可以帮助你
Well I'm sure Major Sholto and myself

1441
01:33:59,282 --> 01:34:02,407
would like to help you if we could.

1442
01:34:01,994 --> 01:34:04,371
至少我们可以谈谈
We could at least talk about,

1443
01:34:04,408 --> 01:34:08,222
要是我们同意
that is of course if we can agree as to terms.

1444
01:34:09,481 --> 01:34:12,960
在这样的处境下 我只有一个条件
There's only one bargain

1445
01:34:11,658 --> 01:34:14,723
a man in my position can make.

1446
01:34:13,962 --> 01:34:15,658
恢复我的自由
In exchange for my freedom

1447
01:34:15,696 --> 01:34:18,083
还有我那三个同伴
and that of my 3 companions

1448
01:34:18,121 --> 01:34:21,583
我们会将宝物的五分之一分给你们
we shall give you a fifth share

1449
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,060
五分之一?
to divide between you.

1450
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:25,442
那可不多啊
A fifth?

1451
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,092
至少五万英镑
That isn't very much.

1452
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:29,291
50 thousand at the least.

1453
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,788
可我们怎么恢复你们的自由呢?
Anyway how can we possibly

1454
01:34:30,825 --> 01:34:32,604
你要知道 这不可能
give you your freedom?

1455
01:34:32,641 --> 01:34:35,543
我们要的就是一只船和足够的食物
You know it's impossible.

1456
01:34:34,004 --> 01:34:37,129
All we need is a boat and provisions.

1457
01:34:36,146 --> 01:34:38,284
在Calcutta或是Madras
There are plenty little yachts and yawls

1458
01:34:38,322 --> 01:34:41,123
有很多的小快艇
in Calcutta or Madras,

1459
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:44,314
这些就够了
Well enough to serve our purpose.

1460
01:34:44,352 --> 01:34:46,187
要是你一个人还好办
If only there were just one of you.

1461
01:34:46,225 --> 01:34:47,248
不行
None.

1462
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,987
少一个也不行
None or all.

1463
01:34:50,026 --> 01:34:51,787
我们发过誓
We have sworn it.

1464
01:34:51,824 --> 01:34:54,226
四个人要在一起!
The 4 of us must always act together!

1465
01:34:57,436 --> 01:34:58,717
冷静 Sholto
Calm yourself Sholto.

1466
01:34:58,754 --> 01:35:01,590
冷静 想想看
Calm yourself,

1467
01:35:01,628 --> 01:35:03,303
想想看
think about it man,

1468
01:35:03,341 --> 01:35:06,210
Small是一个守信用的人
think about it.

1469
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,664
Small is a man of his word

1470
01:35:06,248 --> 01:35:09,620
他不辜负朋友
he will not abandon his friends.

1471
01:35:09,657 --> 01:35:14,195
我想我们可以信任他
I think we may very well trust him.

1472
01:35:17,684 --> 01:35:20,591
我们第二天的凌晨见了面
We met the next morning in the small hours.

1473
01:35:20,629 --> 01:35:24,193
我详细写下了我们的协议
I had our written agreement in every detail.

1474
01:35:25,974 --> 01:35:29,483
作为大英维多利亚女王领导下军队的长官...
We being officers in the Army

1475
01:35:29,946 --> 01:35:34,222
作为大英维多利亚女王领导下军队的长官...
of her majesty Queen Victoria...

1476
01:35:30,585 --> 01:35:32,569
We being officers in the Army

1477
01:35:32,678 --> 01:35:34,555
of her majesty Queen Victoria...

1478
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:36,287
在神圣的圣经面前发誓
Do swear on the Holy Bible

1479
01:35:36,324 --> 01:35:39,293
永远遵守协议
that this agreement will always remain

1480
01:35:39,331 --> 01:35:40,723
永不反悔
sacred and binding to us.

1481
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:42,963
在神圣的圣经面前发誓
Do swear on the Holy Bible

1482
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,539
永远遵守协议 永不反悔
that this agreement will always remain

1483
01:35:45,157 --> 01:35:48,008
sacred and binding to us.

1484
01:35:47,578 --> 01:35:48,824
我给他们每个人一张地图
I gave each of them a plan

1485
01:35:48,862 --> 01:35:51,295
标出了宝藏的位置
showing the position of the treasure.

1486
01:35:58,866 --> 01:36:01,601
这个把我的记忆带回到那时
Oh that brings back memories.

1487
01:36:02,827 --> 01:36:05,036
Sholto坐船去了印度
Sholto took the next boat to India,

1488
01:36:05,074 --> 01:36:06,773
找到了宝藏
found the treasure

1489
01:36:06,811 --> 01:36:08,746
把宝藏带回了英国?
and took it back with him to England?

1490
01:36:08,783 --> 01:36:09,814
是的
Yes.

1491
01:36:10,212 --> 01:36:11,719
当我们听到消息
When we heard the news

1492
01:36:12,156 --> 01:36:15,045
Morstan上尉和我都很气愤
Captain Morstan was as angry as I was.

1493
01:36:15,342 --> 01:36:16,299
他向我发誓
He swore to me he would go home

1494
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:19,156
要回去找Sholto算账
and settle the matter with Sholto.

1495
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:33,153
要是他还活着 他会的
And so he would if he lived

1496
01:36:34,146 --> 01:36:36,748
但是那不可能了
but that was not to be.

1497
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,460
从那天起
From that day,

1498
01:36:46,496 --> 01:36:49,448
我只为报仇而活
I lived only for vengeance.

1499
01:36:52,428 --> 01:36:58,641
日夜不忘
I thought of it by day,

1500
01:36:57,113 --> 01:36:59,477
I nursed it by night

1501
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:00,999
要找到Sholto
to get to Sholto,

1502
01:37:01,538 --> 01:37:03,712
亲手掐住他的喉咙
put my hands on his throat

1503
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:06,279
那就是我唯一的想法
that was my one thought.

1504
01:37:07,345 --> 01:37:09,008
幸运的是
As luck would have it,

1505
01:37:09,044 --> 01:37:12,392
岛上的一个居民 被带到了我的医疗所
one of the islanders

1506
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:14,765
被蛇咬伤 大半条命已经没了
had been brought in to my dispensary,

1507
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:15,647
more than half dead from a snakebite.

1508
01:37:14,803 --> 01:37:18,025
出于人道 我尽所能帮助他
And in common humanity I did my best for him.

1509
01:37:18,512 --> 01:37:20,796
于是他康复过来
Somehow he pulled through

1510
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:23,980
变得对我非常忠诚
and became very devoted to me,

1511
01:37:25,669 --> 01:37:27,813
一个有趣的小矮子
a funny little fellow.

1512
01:37:29,121 --> 01:37:31,362
先生们
Well you gentlemen

1513
01:37:31,401 --> 01:37:32,983
你们见过他
caught a glimpse of him yourselves,

1514
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:34,940
毫无疑问 就在昨晚
no doubt, last night.

1515
01:37:35,604 --> 01:37:39,034
他就是忠诚可靠的小Tonga
He was staunch and true little Tonga.

1516
01:37:39,782 --> 01:37:42,740
没有比他更忠诚的同伴了
No man ever had a more faithful mate.

1517
01:37:45,193 --> 01:37:46,969
他是个渔夫
Being by trade a fisherman

1518
01:37:47,005 --> 01:37:49,834
有一只不错的土著船
he had a goodish size native boat

1519
01:37:49,871 --> 01:37:52,632
他同意和我一起逃走
and he had agreed to try to escape with me.

1520
01:39:04,912 --> 01:39:08,165
10天之后 我们遇见了一只商船
After 1 0 days we were picked up by a trader

1521
01:39:08,202 --> 01:39:11,458
带着一批香客 从马来开往吉达
with a cargo of pilgrims from Malay bound for Gito.

1522
01:39:11,496 --> 01:39:13,480
数月之后
After many months

1523
01:39:13,718 --> 01:39:16,769
我们历经艰险
we worked our way across the world

1524
01:39:16,806 --> 01:39:19,411
回到了伦敦
to London.

1525
01:39:22,272 --> 01:39:24,549
过程很精彩
A remarkable account.

1526
01:39:26,029 --> 01:39:29,312
现在 我想Morstan小姐
And now I think Miss Morstan

1527
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:32,630
可能想看看这些财宝
might like to see the Great Agra Treasure,

1528
01:39:32,667 --> 01:39:36,240
这将使她成为全英国最有钱的女士之一
which will surely make her

1529
01:39:36,276 --> 01:39:38,253
-华生? -没钥匙
one of the richest young ladies in England.

1530
01:39:38,291 --> 01:39:41,249
我想这跟铁火棍可以
Watson?

1531
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:39,112
There's no key.

1532
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:41,968
I'm sure our iron poker will oblige.

1533
01:40:09,519 --> 01:40:11,146
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1534
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:19,569
这是你做的 Small?
This is your doing Small.

1535
01:40:19,606 --> 01:40:20,520
是的
Yes.

1536
01:40:20,558 --> 01:40:22,477
我把宝藏都扔掉了
Yes I put the treasure away

1537
01:40:22,514 --> 01:40:25,727
你们永远也得不到
where you shall never lay a hand on it.

1538
01:40:25,764 --> 01:40:28,860
没有人能有权利拥有
No living man or woman has any right to it

1539
01:40:28,899 --> 01:40:32,789
除非是在安达曼兵营里的那三个人 还有我
unless it is the 3 men

1540
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:35,059
in the Andaman Convict Barracks and myself.

1541
01:40:34,422 --> 01:40:37,132
我知道我没机会拥有了
I know now that I cannot have the use of it,

1542
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,222
没人会有
no more can they.

1543
01:40:39,778 --> 01:40:43,618
我做的这些是为了他们 也是为我
But I have acted all along

1544
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:44,934
for them as much as for myself.

1545
01:40:44,488 --> 01:40:47,123
我们一直把四签名带在身上
We have the sign of four with us always.

1546
01:40:48,413 --> 01:40:50,330
宝藏哪去了?
Where is it?

1547
01:40:50,762 --> 01:40:52,863
在钥匙所在的地方
Where the key is

1548
01:40:52,901 --> 01:40:55,411
在小Tonga所在的地方
and where little Tonga is.

1549
01:40:57,254 --> 01:40:58,967
我看见你们的汽艇要赶上我们
I saw your launch might catch us

1550
01:40:59,004 --> 01:41:01,845
我看小Tonga倒在一边
and I saw little Tonga go over the side.

1551
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:07,300
我把财宝放到了一个安全的地方
I put the loot in a safe place.

1552
01:41:07,338 --> 01:41:09,898
你骗我们 Small
You are deceiving us Small if you had wished

1553
01:41:09,936 --> 01:41:12,772
要是你想把财宝扔进泰晤士河
to throw the treasure into the Thames

1554
01:41:12,809 --> 01:41:16,031
把箱子扔进去不是更容易
it would have been easier

1555
01:41:16,069 --> 01:41:17,477
我扔得容易
to have thrown box and all.

1556
01:41:17,514 --> 01:41:19,662
你们捞得也容易
Easier for me to throw

1557
01:41:18,301 --> 01:41:21,747
and easier for you to recover.

1558
01:41:20,714 --> 01:41:23,248
有本事把我抓住的人
A man who's clever enough to hunt me down

1559
01:41:23,286 --> 01:41:25,228
也有本事把箱子
is clever enough to pick up a box

1560
01:41:25,265 --> 01:41:27,212
从河底捞上来
from the bottom of the river.

1561
01:41:31,299 --> 01:41:32,371
我很遗憾
I am sorry.

1562
01:41:32,409 --> 01:41:34,877
我很庆幸财宝没了
I am glad the treasure is lost.

1563
01:41:36,658 --> 01:41:40,764
对于拥有宝藏的人来说 它只是个诅咒
It's been nothing but a curse

1564
01:41:39,497 --> 01:41:42,562
to every man who has owned it.

1565
01:41:41,898 --> 01:41:44,927
不仅是我可怜的父亲
And only death to my poor father.

1566
01:41:44,964 --> 01:41:49,262
还有我和我同伴们苦役的生活
And slavery for life

1567
01:41:47,272 --> 01:41:50,302
to me and my companions.

1568
01:41:49,711 --> 01:41:51,487
我们的前半生都
We spent the first half of my life

1569
01:41:51,524 --> 01:41:54,352
在Andaman修水坝
digging a breakwater in the Andaman's.

1570
01:41:55,806 --> 01:41:57,894
可能我的下半生要在
And I'm likely to spend the other half

1571
01:41:57,932 --> 01:42:00,434
Dartmoor修水渠了
digging ditches on Dartmoor.

1572
01:42:03,175 --> 01:42:05,726
福尔摩斯 责任就是责任
Well Holmes duty is duty

1573
01:42:05,765 --> 01:42:08,718
今天对你已经够通融了
and I've gone rather far in bringing him here.

1574
01:42:08,755 --> 01:42:13,122
我相信只有把这个讲故事的人送进监狱
I shall feel more at ease

1575
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,608
我才能放心
when I have our storyteller here

1576
01:42:14,646 --> 01:42:18,825
我很感谢你们的协助
under lock and key.

1577
01:42:15,406 --> 01:42:20,493
I am obliged to you for your assistance.

1578
01:42:19,917 --> 01:42:22,113
再见 华生医生
Good day to you. Doctor Watson,

1579
01:42:22,151 --> 01:42:23,425
Morstan小姐
Miss Morstan.

1580
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:31,351
你先走 Small
Awe, after you Small.

1581
01:42:31,833 --> 01:42:35,635
否则你要用木腿打我真是太容易了
you seem a bit handy

1582
01:42:33,882 --> 01:42:36,211
with that wooden leg of yours.

1583
01:43:22,412 --> 01:43:25,314
真是惭愧 福尔摩斯先生
I feel most ashamed that you Mr. Holmes

1584
01:43:25,351 --> 01:43:27,457
还有亲爱的华生医生
and you dear Doctor Watson

1585
01:43:27,495 --> 01:43:28,618
让你们为了我的事
have had to put yourself

1586
01:43:28,655 --> 01:43:30,824
冒了那么多的险
into such peril on my behalf.

1587
01:43:30,862 --> 01:43:32,806
一切都结束了 别这么说
Oh that's all over and forgotten.

1588
