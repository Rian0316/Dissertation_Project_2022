00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:23,071
他对赛马很感兴趣

13
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,708
我会骑马 Robert爵士
I can ride, Sir Robert.

14
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:26,425
我想要做骑师
I'd love to be a jockey.

15
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:27,149
是吗?
Would you?

16
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,773
超过任何愿望
More than anything in the world.

17
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,624
嗯 很好 非常好

18
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,371
但这跟我有什么关系?
But what has it got to do with me?

19
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:35,801
我想我可以为你工作
Well, I thought I could work for you.

我已经有足够的骑师了

请给我一次机会吧 先生
Please give me a chance, sir.

22
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,896
我可以清理马厩的垃圾
I'll muck out the stables,

23
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:45,475
清扫马场
clean the yard,

24
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:47,462
随您吩咐
anything you want.

25
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:49,165
我考虑一下
I'll think about it.

26

00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,917
有麻烦了 先生
There's trouble, sir.

30
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,732
我告诉过你Beatrice夫人不舒服
I told you Lady Beatrice is unwell

31
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:06,508
不想被打扰
and does not wish to be disturbed.

32
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:09,341
我想我会成为她的特例
I think she'll make an exception in my case.

33
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:11,959
很抱歉 先生
I'm sorry, sir.

00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:15,587
我接到严格的指示
I have strict instructions.

35
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:18,657
你是让我跟Beatrice夫人谈谈
Are you going to let me speak to Lady Beatrice

36
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:21,097
还是逼我使用暴力?
or will I have to use force?

37
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:26,085
你得先过我这关 Brewer
You'll answer to me first, Brewer.

38
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,077
这位先生坚持
This gentleman is most insistent

39
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:30,715
要与夫人谈话 先生
upon speaking to her ladyship, sir.

40
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:36,655
我警告过你永远不要到这儿来
I warned you never to come here.

41
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:39,390
我们的事可以在你的办公室谈 不是这里

42
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:42,339
我在很多场合试图解决这个问题
I've tried to settle this matter on many occasions.

43
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:44,094
你该知道的 Robert爵士
As you well know, Sir Robert.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,444
想不到在New Market发生那事之后 你居然还有胆子来
You've got a nerve coming here after New Market.

45
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:50,656
这次我有把握
I'm leaving nothing to chance this time.

46
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:53,171
或许Beatrice夫人更乐于
Perhaps Lady Beatrice will be more prepared

47
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,286
听听理由
to listen to reason.

48
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:55,834
这是你我之间的恩怨 Brewer
Your grievance is with me, Brewer,

49
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,969
与他人无关
and with no one else.

50
00:02:57,007 --> 00:03:00,583
这当然与Beatrice夫人有关系
It would certainly be of concern to Lady Beatrice.

51
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:06,417
Robert 这些人是谁?
Robert, who are these people?

52
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:08,268
他们要干什么?
And what do they want?

53
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:09,811
我来告诉你我要干什么 Beatrice夫人
I'll tell you what I want, Lady Beatrice.

54
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:10,542
请他出去
Get him out of here.

55
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,921
我要要回自己的东西!
I want what's rightfully mine.

00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:14,577
出去
Get out.

57
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:18,666
滚! 趁你两条腿还能走
Go while you can still walk.

00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:21,235
我会再来的 Beatrice夫人

00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:22,709
再会
Good day to you.

00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:35,096
很抱歉让你烦心 亲爱的
I'm sorry you've been upset, my dear.

61
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:37,099
他是什么意思 Robert?
What did he mean, Robert,

62
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:39,217
什么是本应属于他的?
what's rightfully his?

63
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,275
没什么可担心的
Nothing for you to worry about.

64
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:44,190
但我的确很担心 Robert
But I do worry, Robert.

65
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:46,432
我太了解你了
I know you too well.

66
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:00,909
他不会再来烦我们了
He won't bother us again.

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,089
如果他真的再来我们该怎么办 先生?
What should we do if he does come back, sir?

68
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:17,598
如果他再来
If he does come back,

69
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:20,329
我会亲自处理
I'll deal with him myself.

70
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:49,587
<font color="#ffff00">肖斯科姆别墅</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Shoscombe Old Place</font>

71
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,082
华生 你懂赛马吗?
Watson, do you know a bit of racing?

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,268
照理说应该懂一点
I ought to.

73
00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:19,745
我的负伤抚恤金有一半都花在了这上面
I paid for it with about half my wound pension.

74
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:23,497
那我要把你当作我的"赛马指南"了
Then I'll give you my handy guide to the turf.

75
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:24,385
你的什么?
Your what?

76
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:27,581
你记得Robert Norberton这个名字吗?
Does the name Sir Robert Norberton recall anything?

77
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,313
小心
Careful.

78
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:33,131
他的马驹参加了冠军锦标赛
He's got a horse running in the Champion Stakes.

79
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:35,333
他住在Shoscombe庄园
He lives at Shoscombe Hall.

80
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,947
他的马厩在当地 被称为Shoscombe别墅
His stables are known locally as Shoscombe Old Place.

81
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,643
但你并不认识他本人?
But you don't know the man himself?

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,005
我从没见过他 如果你是这个意思
I never met him if that's what you mean.

83
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:45,852
他是出了名的危险人物
He has a reputation of being rather a dangerous man.

84
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,081
怎么个危险法?
How dangerous?

85
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,812
我记得数月前有一次
I remember an instance some months ago

86
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,090
他在New Market Heath用马鞭抽了一个人
when he horsewhipped a man on New Market Heath.

87
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:54,185
是Samuel Brewer Carson街的一位放债人
Samuel Brewer, the Carson Street moneylender.

88
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:56,105
为什么会发生这样的攻击事件?
What was the reason for this assault?

89
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:59,285
我猜是Robert爵士忌恨债主
Well, I imagine that Sir Robert had a grudge against moneylenders.

90
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:00,812
也就是说他负债累累
Or is heavily in their debt.

91
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,809
据说 他目前是日陷窘境
Well, by all accounts, he's so far down Queer Street,

92
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,401
可能再也不能恢复往日风光
he may never find his way back again.

93
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:07,489
我收到了John Mason的信
I received a letter from John Mason,

94
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,480
他是Shoscombe的首席训练师

95
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:11,277

Samuel Brewer在几天前失踪的消息

102
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:28,436

106
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:36,862
但我们还是先来说说Shoscombe吧
but let's hear more about Shoscombe.

107
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,922
Shoscombe犬
Well, the Shoscombe spaniels,

108
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:41,691
是Shoscombe别墅女主人的骄傲
special pride of the lady of Shoscombe Place.

109
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:43,729
她是Robert Norberton的妻子？
The wife of Sir Robert Norberton I presume.

110
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:45,123
不 不 他没结过婚

你是说 她寄住在他那里？
You mean she lives with him?

114
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:55,368
不 不 房子属于她的前夫 James爵士
No, no, the place belonged to her late husband, Sir James.

115
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:57,879
Shoscombe会出什么事呢?
What should be amiss at Shoscombe?

116
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,694
到底是怎么回事呢?
What indeed?

117
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,168
希望门外那位能够告诉我们
And here I expect is the man who can tell us.

118
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,812
请进
Yes?

119
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:07,291
我的蛋煮老了
My eggs were hard boiled.

120
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,914
有一位Mason先生想要见您 先生

这边请

124
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:22,340
-福尔摩斯先生 您收到我的信了吗? -是的
-You got my note, Mr. Holmes? -Yes.

125
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,357
但里面什么都没说
But it explained nothing.

126
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:26,399
要把细节都付诸文字
It was too delicate a thing

127
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:28,815
实在太难下手了
for me to put the details on paper.

128
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:31,464
事情太复杂了
It was too complicated.

129

你可以信任我的朋友兼同事  华生医生的谨言慎行

131
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:47,346
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

132
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,311
我想Robert Norberton爵士是疯了
I think Sir Robert Norberton has gone mad.

133
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:53,674
拜托 这里是Baker街 不是Harley街 (伦敦著名的医疗街)
Please, this is Baker Street not Harley Street.

134
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:54,801
你为什么这么说?
Why do you say so?

135
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:58,551
我想是"Shoscombe王子"和冠军锦标赛
I believe Shoscombe Prince and the Champion Stakes

136
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:00,786
把他弄成这样的
have turned his brain.

137
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:05,558
-"Shoscombe王子"? - (马驹)
Shoscombe Prince?

138
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:08,189
华生 你真是无价之宝  一匹吗?
Watson, you're invaluable. A horse?

139
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,998
全英格兰最好的马 先生
The finest in England, sir.

140
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:14,353
事实上 Robert爵士必须赢得比赛
The truth is Sir Robert has got to win this race.

141
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,625
他已经无路可走 这是最后的机会了
He's up to his neck, and it's his last chance.

142
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,662
他把所有能够筹集的财产都押在了这匹马上
He's wagered everything he could raise or borrow on the horse,

143
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,139
他把所有欠款
and he's holding off his creditors

144
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:24,022
都拖延到大赛之后归还
till after the big race.

145
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:27,477
如果"王子"输掉了比赛 他就完蛋了
Oh, if the Prince fails him, he's done for.

146
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:30,652
你是猜测Robert爵士的债务
And you're assuming there's a connection between Sir Robert's debts

147
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,584
与Samuel Brewer的失踪之间有关联
and the disappearance of Samuel Brewer.

148
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:36,238
他是Robert爵士的主要债权人
He's Sir Robert's principal creditor,

149
00:08:36,276 --> 00:08:37,849
而且我得指出
and I don't mind admitting

150
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,308
他们之间没有任何好感
there's no love lost between them.

151
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:42,368
在New Market的事情发生之后
Well, after what happened at New Market

152
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,964
我一点也不惊讶
I'm not surprised.

153
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:45,926
但那仅仅是开始
But that was just the start.

154
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:48,004
Brewer上周在庄园露面
Brewer showed his face at the hall last week,

155
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,766
Robert爵士像疯了一样朝他发飙
and Sir Robert flew at him like a man possessed.

156
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:52,341
说如果他再出现
Said he'd deal with him

157
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,919
他会亲自收拾他
if he ever showed his face there again.

158
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:56,454
我想他再也没回来
I presume he has not returned.

159
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,548
我不知道 先生
I don't know, sir.

160
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,301
不确定
Not for sure.

161
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,678
了解
I see.

162
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:04,780
如果财产危机真的发生
In the event of financial catastrophe,

163
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,690
Robert爵士有权主张他姐姐的地产吗?
would Sir Robert have any claim on his sister's estate?

164
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:10,600
据我所知不行
None at all as far as I know.

165
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,482
她只有非世袭的财产所有权
She only has a life interest in it.

166
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:16,316
在她死后 地产将归她丈夫的兄弟所有
It reverts to her husband's  brother after her death.

167
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:17,251
同时
In the meantime,

168
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:20,021
她能以夫人的身份收取年租
her ladyship draws the rents every year.

169
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,216
而钱都被她弟弟花掉了?
And her brother spends them?

170
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,170
差不多
That's about the size of it.

171
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:27,790
他的生活一定很坎坷
He must lead a most uneasy life?

172
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:30,845
或许吧 但他们一直是挚友
Well, maybe so, but they've  always been the best of friends.

173
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,981
他们志同道合
They have the same tastes.

174
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,068
她跟他一样热爱赛马
She loves the horses as much as he does.

175
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:41,377
至少曾经是
Or at least she did.

176
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,021
以前每天12点
Every day at about 12:00

177
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:46,324
她都要驱车去马厩看马
she'd ride down to the stables to see them.

178
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:48,666
尤其是
And above all,

179
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:51,417
她十分喜爱"王子"
she loved the Prince.

180
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:56,430
早上好 Beatrice
Good morning, Beatrice.

181
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:01,595
我等不及想看看当这个讨喜的小家伙
I can't wait to see their faces

182
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,100
第一个冲过终点柱的时候 他们会是什么表情
when this delightful creature is first past the post.

183
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,092
你怎么说 Mason?
What say you, Mason?

184
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:07,288
其它马不会有胜算 先生
The others won't stand a chance, sir.

185
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:08,871
赢它们三个身长 你说呢?
A three-length win, wouldn't you say?

186
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,194
三个半身长 至少
Three and a half, at least.

187
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:15,632
只是不要期望太高 Robert
Just beware of raising your hopes too high, Robert.

188
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,550
你不是唯一一个想让自己的赛马
You're not the only one who'd like to see

189
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:20,253
在冠军锦标赛上夺冠的人
his horse win the Champion Stakes.

190
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,070
但我是唯一一个拥有 "Shoscombe王子"的人
I'm the only one with a horse like Shoscombe Prince.

191
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,609
它的状态怎么这么好
Why he's on such good form,

192
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:27,713
你甚至可以亲自骑着它去夺冠 亲爱的
you could ride him to victory yourself, my dear.

193
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,723
我想不行了 Robert
I think not, Robert.

194
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,047
我们骑马的日子已经结束了
Our riding days are over.

195
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:51,690
你该休息的 亲爱的
You should be resting, my dear.

196
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:53,468
不 我很好 Robert
No, I'm fine, Robert.

197
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:54,868
真的 我很好
Really, I'm fine.

198
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,578
你知道医生的叮嘱
You know what the doctor said.

199
00:10:56,616 --> 00:11:00,556
你比他还要大惊小怪
You fuss even more than he does.

200
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:05,391
Jasper 真乖
Jasper, good dog.

201
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,358
Carrie 你今天怎么样?
And how's Carrie today?

202
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:14,077
很好 谢谢 Robert爵士
Oh, very well, thank you, Sir Robert.

203
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:22,025
而在过去一周
But for the past week,

204
00:11:22,062 --> 00:11:23,926
她的马车依然驶过马厩
her ladyship has driven past the stables

205
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:26,739
却再也没有来打过招呼
with never so much  as a good morning.

206
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:31,107
你认为他们之间有了争执吗?
Do you think there's been some sort of quarrel?

207
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:34,625
是彼此怀恨 来势汹汹  剑拔弩张的一次争吵
And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that.

208
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,495
现在 他都不会接近她
Now, he never goes near her.

209
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:38,430
她几乎都不离开房间
She hardly leaves her room

210
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:40,622
除了每天乘车出行
except to take her daily drive.

211
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,892
我想你亲眼目睹了这场争论的发生
And I assume that you have witnessed such a disagreement?

212
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:46,871
不 没有
Well, no, not exactly.

213
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:51,522
但否则为什么他要把她的宠物狗 送走呢 福尔摩斯先生?
But why else would he give away her pet spaniel, Mr. Holmes?

214
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,420
她喜欢那只狗 视如己出
She loved that dog as if it were her child.

215
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:59,165
你能给出任何理由为什么Robert爵士
Can you think of any reason why Sir Robert

216
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:02,324
要以这种方式令他的姐姐难过吗?
would wish to upset his sister in this fashion?

217
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:03,990
想不通
None at all.

218
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:07,033
这样对待一位心脏脆弱的女士实在太残忍了
It's a cruel way to treat a woman with a weak heart.

219
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,311
简直差劲透了
It's damn rotten.

220
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:16,188
我得说我并不认为他犯了什么罪
I must say he does not appear to be  committing any crime that I recognize.

221
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:22,101
那为什么Robert爵士要在夜里离开宅子?
So why did Sir Robert leave the house at the dead of night,

222
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:24,128
他去见的人是谁呢?
and who was the man he met?

223
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,975
说下去
Go on.

224
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,829
是管家Stephens看到他出了门
Well, it was Stephens, the butler, who saw him leave,

225
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,888
然后告诉了我
and he told me about it.

226
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,637
所以第二天夜里我们跟踪了他
So the next night we followed him.

227
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,848
那是谁
Who was it?

228
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:18,149
-Samuel Brewer? -当时太黑了 看不清他的脸
-Samuel Brewer? -It's too dark to see his face.

229
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:20,538
Robert爵士在什么时候送走了他姐姐的狗?
When did Sir Robert give away his sister's dog?

230
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:23,014
一周前的今天
A week ago today.

231
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,679
Jasper在磨坊里鬼哭狼嚎
Jasper was howling like a banshee at the mill house,

232
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:30,720
但身为主人也不该就这么送人呀
but that was no good reason for the master to do what he did.

233
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,291
Robert爵士
Sir Robert.

234
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,832
我要它离开这里
I want it offthis estate.

235
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,787
我不在乎你怎么处置它
I don't care what you do with it

236
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:49,502
只要别再让我看到它
just as long as I never have to see it again.

237
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,678
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

238
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,969
我把狗给了Sandy Bain
I gave the dog to Sandy Bain,

239
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,797
一位骑师
the jockey.

240
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:00,493
好了 Jasper
Right then, Jasper.

241
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,997
我们去喝点东西吧
Let's you and I go for a drink, hey.

242
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:04,727
走吧
Come on.

243
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:07,004
第二天早上 他把狗给了Josiah Barnes
Next morning, he took it to Josiah Barnes,

244
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:09,894
Crendall那儿的Green Dragon旅馆的老板
the landlord at the Green Dragon in Crendall.

245
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:13,943
Beatrice夫人有贴身伴侣吗?
Does Lady Beatrice have a companion?

246
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,587
有个女仆 福尔摩斯先生
Her maid, Mr. Holmes.

247
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,505
只有一个?
Just the one?

248
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:17,659
Carrie Evans
Carrie Evans.

249
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:20,120
但她已经跟随夫人五年了
But she's been with her this five years.

250
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:22,449
那她很忠心了?
And is no doubt devoted?

251
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,636
她的确很忠心 不过我不能说是对谁
She is devoted enough, and I won't say to whom.

252
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,221
哦?
Uh-huh.

253
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:31,217
我不能搬弄是非
I can't tell tales out of school.

254
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:36,018
Robert爵士挺会讨女人欢心的吧?
Sir Robert is something of a lady's man, hey?

255
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,446
你不觉得姐弟间的不睦
Do you not think the quarrel

256
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,506
可能是由此产生的吗?
between brother and sister may lie there?

257
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:42,582
哦 这个流言早已是人尽皆知了
Oh, that scandal has been  pretty clear for a long time.

258
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,396
但Beatrice夫人或许之前没有发现
But Lady Beatrice may not have seen it before.

259
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:47,617
让我们假设她突然知晓了
Let us suppose that she suddenly found it out,

260
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:50,522
于是要辞退这个讨她厌的女仆
and she wants to be rid of the hated maid.

261
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,043
但他不同意
He will not permit it.

262
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:54,185
于是她拒绝跟他说话
She refuses to speak to him.

263
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:55,923
而Robert爵士一怒之下
And Sir Robert in his anger

264
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,406
送走了她的爱犬
gives away her dog.

265
00:14:57,444 --> 00:15:00,629
不止这些 福尔摩斯先生
There's more to it than that, Mr. Holmes.

266
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,187
Mason先生
Mr. Mason,

267
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,457
你比我们有优势
you have the advantage of us.

268
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,217
可能还有些你
Perhaps there is something

269
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:12,871
没有告诉我们的事
that you have not told us.

270
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:20,117
地下室里有个中央暖气锅炉
There's a central heating furnace in the cellar.

271
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,881
已经许久未用了
It's been off for some time,

272
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,972
但Robert爵士抱怨天冷
but Sir Robert complained of cold.

273
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,941
又把它烧了起来
And had it on again.

274
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:37,799
Harvey负责烧锅炉
Harvey runs it.

275
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,312
他是我的一个伙计
He's one of my lads.

276
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:45,169
他感到不妙 福尔摩斯先生
He didn't like the look of it, Mr. Holmes.

277
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:49,402
昨晚把这个交个了我
And he brought it to me last night.

278
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,592
Harvey多久烧一次炉子?
How often does Harvey attend the furnace?

279
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:54,249
他每晚把炉子烧起来
He makes it up every evening,

280
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,513
然后就离开
and then he leaves it.

281
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,925
那么有人能在晚上出入那里吗?
So anyone can visit it during the night?

282
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,212
我想是的
I suppose so.

283
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:02,508
但伙计拿着大门的钥匙
But the lad has the key to the outer door.

284
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,594
知道了
I see.

285
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:07,908
你提到的那个旅店叫什么?
What is the name of that tavern you spoke of?

286
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:09,310
Green Dragon
Green Dragon.

287
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:12,649
在Parkshire有不错的钓鱼点吧?
Is there any good fishing in that part of Parkshire?

288
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:15,460
河沟里有鲑鱼
There's trout in the millstream

289
00:16:15,498 --> 00:16:17,481
湖里有梭子鱼
and pike in the lake.

290
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,077
已经够好了
That's good enough.

291
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:19,962
你认为这是什么 华生?
What do you make of it, Watson?

292
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:23,470
这是大腿的上髁
It's the upper contour of a femur.

293
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,584
人骨吗?
Human?

294
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:37,257
毫无疑问
Without a doubt.

295
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,634
这是在唬人 先生
It's a bluff, sir.

296
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:50,202
可能是任何人寄来的
Anyone could have sent it.

297
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:52,182
也许是个马探子
It could be a tout.

298
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,810
我不在乎谁写的
I don't care who it is.

299
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,712
我要知道他所写的内容中 是否有属实的部分
I need to know if there's any truth in what he's written.

300
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:01,687
我离开的期间 Carrie负责照顾家中事务
Carrie will be in charge of the house while I'm away.

301
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:04,394
Carrie吗 先生?
Carrie, sir?

302
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:06,923
你得把心思放在"王子"的训练上
Your concern must be for the Prince's training.

303
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,997
没有再比那更重要的事了
Nothing is more important than that.

304
00:17:11,713 --> 00:17:13,757
53...
Fifty-three,

305
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:15,718
54...
Fifty-four,

306
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:18,412
55...
Fifty-five.

307
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,444
有何吩咐 女士?
Yes, ma'am?

308
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:23,891
谢谢 Stephens 把餐盘拿走吧
Thank you, Stephens, please take the tray now.

309
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:28,567
56...
Fifty-six.

310
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,816
我黎明时出发
I leave at dawn.

311
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:49,838
两间房是吗 先生?
Two room,is that right, sir?

312
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:50,932
再要两杯你这儿最好的酒
And two glasses of your best ale.

313
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:52,012
好的 先生
Right, sir.

314
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,766
-福尔摩斯 -嗯?
Holmes? Hm?

315
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,333
嘘
Sh.

316
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:01,637
先生们 你们好
Good day, gentlemen?

317
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,547
你好 老家伙
Hello, old fellow.

318
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:04,614
哦 女士们 不好意思
Oh, ladies, I'm so sorry.

319
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:06,347
我刚才没注意你们坐在这
I didn't see you sitting there.

320
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:10,605
这里真是寒风凛冽啊 不是吗?
There's quite a bite in the air, isn't there?

321
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:13,109
你想要更自由些吧?
Oh, you'd much rather be free, wouldn't you?

322
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:16,551
老板!
Landlord!

323
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,057
难道一定要把这条狗栓得这么紧吗?
Is it really necessary to keep this dog tied up like this?

324
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:20,768
先生 如果不栓紧了
If I didn't, sir,

325
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:22,422
它一溜烟就会跑回原来的主人家
it'd be off back to the owner in a jiffy.

326
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:25,024
你看 先生 Jasper是只Shoscombe犬
You see, sir, Jasper's a Shoscombe spaniel.

327
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:26,218
哦 我本该看出来的
Oh, I should have known.

328
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:29,262
瞧 我也是个爱狗之人
You see, I'm quite a dog enthusiast myself.

329
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:31,191
等等
Wait.

330
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:32,645
拿行李时小心点
Be careful with that luggage

331
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:34,621
否则我活剥了你的皮
or I'll skin you alive.

332
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,600
请别放心里去 先生们
Don't you mind him, sirs.

333
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:42,130
他还要照顾他的母亲
He takes after his mother.

334
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:47,370
是出来钓鱼的吗?
Out for a bit of fishing, hey?

335
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:49,416
我们想在Hole湖
We thought we might try and land a pike or two

336
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:50,215
钓几条梭子鱼
at the Hole Lake.

337
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:52,148
没等你钓到鱼
You might find yourselves in the lake

338
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:53,760
你自己就先掉里头去了
before you were through.

339
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:57,849
为什么呢?
Why is that?

340
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,027
因为Robert爵士极度警惕
That Sir Robert is terrible jealous of anyone

341
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:02,104
怕有人监视他的马厩
who might be spying on his stables.

342
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:03,799
我们又不是马探子
Well, we're not touts.

343
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:08,507
他是那种先斩后奏的人
He's the sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards.

344
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:12,786
华生 我们午餐前
Watson, I think we should take a little walk

345
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:14,005
出去走走吧
before lunch.

346
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,146
主意不错
Well, that's a splendid idea.

347
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:21,893
老板 我们可以把狗带上吗?
Do you think we could take the dog with us, Landlord?

348
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,270
当然可以 先生们
By all means, gentlemen.

349
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:26,812
只是记得我说的关于Robert爵士的事
But mind what I said about Sir Robert.

350
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:34,665
走这边 华生
It's this way, Watson.

351
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,652
Robert爵士现在如何了?
What about Sir Robert?

352
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:56,942
据我估计
By my estimate,

353
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,074
他现在应该在去York的路上
he should be well on his way to York by now.

354
00:20:59,112 --> 00:20:59,917
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

355
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,937
因为我给他发了封电报
Because I had a telegram sent to him.

356
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:04,743
福尔摩斯 你有什么目的?
Holmes, what have you been up to?

357
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:06,481
当然 Palmer是最有希望获胜的
Of course, Palmer's the Favorite

358
00:21:06,518 --> 00:21:08,091
就养在York附近的马厩里
is stabled somewhere near York.

359
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:10,351
我只是提示他那匹马
I merely advised him that the horse has shown

360
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:11,763
最近几天有了长足的进步
much improvement in the last few days.

361
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:14,011
当他发现自己被愚弄了可不会高兴的
He won't be pleased when he finds he's been duped.

362
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,756
我确定他会气急败坏
I'm sure he'll be furious.

363
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,277
Jasper
Jasper.

364
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,237
Jasper
Jasper.

365
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,867
来啊 小伙 你好啊
Come on boy, hello boy.

366
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:24,230
你怎么样啊
How are you aye, hello.

367
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:26,576
Jasper 这儿
Jasper. Here.

368
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:34,271
我认识你们吗?
Do I know you?

369
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:38,310
不 但显然Jasper认识你
No, but evidently, Jasper knows you.

370
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,271
你一定是Sandy Bain
You must be Sandy Bain.

371
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,768
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

372
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:44,337
是你上周把Jasper送到旅店的
It was you that brought Jasper to the tavern last week.

373
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,105
是的
That's right.

374
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,741
你喜欢动物吗?
You're fond of animals?

375
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:49,520
它们都由上帝所造 先生
They're all God's creatures, sir.

376
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,626
我不愿看到它们受伤害
I won't see no harm come to them.

377
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:52,810
Mason先生似乎认为
Mr. Mason seemed to think

378
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:55,349
Jasper幸运的逃脱了
that Jasper had a lucky escape.

379
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:56,465
他那么做
He must have had a reason

380
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:57,617
一定是有原因的
for behaving like he did.

381
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,960
我相信Robert爵士的确有他的动机
I'm sure Sir Robert had the best of motives.

382
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:02,366
不 我是说Jasper
No, I'm talking about Jasper.

383
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,886
他一直很安静
He's always such a quiet dog.

384
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,038
一定是发生了什么
Well, something must have happened to him.

385
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,449
在那磨坊里?
At the millhouse?

386
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:09,393
不 先生
No, sir.

387
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,376
地下室?
The cellar?

388
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,497
不 先生 是在老教堂里
No, sir, at the old church.

389
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:15,027
事情就发生在我把它送去
It was the same morning

390
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:17,291
Green Dragon旅店的那天早上
I brought him to the Green Dragon.

391
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,732
那是个破旧损毁的小礼拜堂
It's an old ruin chapel,

392
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,867
下面有个地下室
and under it there's a crypt

393
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:24,262
在本地声名并不好
which has a bad name among us.

394
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:30,092
Jasper
Jasper.

395
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:32,731
别过去
Not that way.

396
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,464
Jasper
Jasper.

397
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:36,853
Jasper 回来
Jasper, come back.

398
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,819
Jasper 回来
Jasper, come back.

399
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:46,296
Jasper
Jasper.

400
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:50,066
Jasper
Jasper.

401
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:09,228
Jasper
Jasper.

402
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:13,361
来啊 孩子
Come on, boy.

403
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,984
来啊 我可不是在玩
Come on. I'm not playing games now.

404
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,666
Jasper
Jasper.

405
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:19,397
这里离庄园有多远?
How far are we away from the hall?

406
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:22,068
大约四分之一英里 先生
About a quarter of a mile, sir.

407
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:27,068
Beatrice夫人是在正午乘车出行吧?
I'm correct in thinking that  Lady Beatrice takes a drive about midday?

408
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:27,627
对 先生
Yes, sir.

409
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:29,415
谢谢 事不宜迟
Thank you, we've not a moment to lose.

410
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:31,354
快走 Jasper 快走 华生 快走
Come Jasper, come Watson, come.

411
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:16,944
拦住马车 华生
Stop the carriage, Watson,

412
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,680
拦住马车
stop the carriage!

413
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:25,108
不好意思
Excuse me.

414
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:33,921
请问去镇上的Green Dragon该怎么走?
Could you direct us to the Green Dragon in town?

415
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:41,213
快走 快走
Drive on, drive on.

416
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:45,123
呆着 别过来
Stay, stay back.

417
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:47,749
别过来
Stay back.

418
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:04,191
在Beatrice夫人明天再次乘车出行之前
Well, there's nothing we can do

419
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,225
我们没什么能做的
until Lady Beatrice takes her drive again tomorrow.

420
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:08,712
你还没解释为什么
You still haven't explained

421
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:10,512
今天午后要我那样冒险拦车
why I risked my life this afternoon.

422
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,341
为了验证一个推理
To test a theory.

423
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:13,177
你一定很失望
You must be very disappointed.

424
00:26:13,214 --> 00:26:14,645
没验证成功却害我差点丧命
I was almost killed instead.

425
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:17,706
相反 我想我的小实验很成功
On the contrary, I think my little experiment was quite successful.

426
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:18,892
我怎么没看出来
I fail to see how.

427
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:23,517
那只狗 华生 狗
The dog, Watson, the dog.

428
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:26,964
没想到什么吗?
Did that suggest nothing to you?

429
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,858
Carrie Evans决意
Well, Carrie Evans is determined

430
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:31,369
要让狗和女主人不能相见
to keep the dog and her mistress apart so.

431
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:32,461
没有别的吗?
There is an alternative?

432
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:33,646
有啊
Yes,

433
00:26:33,683 --> 00:26:34,911
Robert爵士把那个放债人
that Sir Robert has done away with

434
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:36,530
Samuel Brewer做掉了
the moneylender, Samuel Brewer.

435
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,876
别忘了
Don't forget.

436
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:41,451
别忘了发现的人骨
Don't forget the human bone that was found.

437
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,612
我没忘
I haven't forgotten.

438
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:44,402
对我来讲 显而易见
It's perfectly clear to me.

439
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,355
他们之前有过争执
They've crossed swords before.

440
00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:47,897
很可能这次Robert爵士
It's possible that Sir Robert

441
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:49,063
做得太过分了
has gone too far this time,

442
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:50,224
犯了谋杀罪
and is guilty of murder.

443
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:53,871
那个孩子发现的
What the boy found

444
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:56,984
正是那位不幸的放债人的遗体
is all that remains of the unfortunate moneylender.

445
00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:58,119
哦 不 不 谢谢你
Oh, no, no, thank you.

446
00:26:58,156 --> 00:26:59,329
我饿死了
I'm famished.

447
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,935
新抓到的 福尔摩斯先生
A fresh catch, Mr. Holmes?

448
00:27:05,077 --> 00:27:08,521
好久都没见到这么棒的了
Best I've seen in a long time.

449
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,999
真是"水深火热"啊 华生
These are deep waters, Watson.

450
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,041
水深火热 浊而不清
Deep and rather dirty.

451
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:24,759
我想借用地下室的钥匙
I would like to borrow the key to the cellar.

452
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,037
干什么用 福尔摩斯先生?
For what purpose, Mr. Holmes?

453
00:27:26,074 --> 00:27:27,648
为了进门
To get inside.

454
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:29,867
Robert爵士在哪儿?
Where is Sir Robert?

455
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:31,751
Robert爵士昨天一早
Well, Sir Robert left for York

456
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,290
去York了
early yesterday morning.

457
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:36,045
今晚才能回来
He isn't expected back till some time tonight.

458
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,059
我本应带你四处看看
I'd show you around the house myself,

459
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:41,796
但主人走了 Carrie负责
but master left Carrie in charge,

460
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,427
她不会让任何人跨入大门一步的
and she won't let anyone past the door.

461
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,952
他指派一个女仆掌管庄园?
He left a maid in charge of the house?

462
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:50,013
我告诉过您 主人和夫人有过节
I told you things were bad between master and her ladyship.

463
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:53,237
Beatrice夫人的房间在哪儿?
Whereabouts is Lady Beatrice's room?

464
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:54,450
在一层 福尔摩斯先生
It's on the ground floor, Mr. Holmes,

465
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:56,040
因为她的心脏不好
on account of her ladyship's heart.

466
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:58,574
刚好在底层的...?
Precisely on the ground floor where?

467
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:01,122
走廊里第二间房
Second room in the corridor beside

468
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:03,234
在地下室入口旁边
the cellar passageway.

469
00:28:03,273 --> 00:28:05,215
自从我们在Baker街的谈话之后
Has there been any change in the running of the house

470
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:07,237
房子里的人事有什么变化吗
since we spoke at Baker Street?

471
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:10,873
没想到有什么 除了我得解雇Harvey
None that I can think of, apart from the fact that

472
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:13,036
我的一个伙计
I had to dismiss Harvey, one of my stable lads.

473
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:15,633
他就那个在炉子里发现骨头的人?
Wasn't he the one that found the bone in the furnace?

474
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,385
是的
That's right.

475
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:19,112
为什么要解雇他?
What is the reason for his dismissal?

476
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,315
他偷了这里某个
Well, he'd stolen some money

477
00:28:21,353 --> 00:28:24,019
雇员的钱 所以...
from somebody on the staff and so.

478
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:27,430
啊 这就是"王子" 福尔摩斯先生
Ah, here's the Prince himself, Mr. Holmes.

479
00:28:32,823 --> 00:28:34,725
全身都闪耀着冠军的光芒 你说呢?
Every inch a champion, wouldn't you say?

480
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:36,736
是啊 非常出色的生灵
Yes, he's a very fine creature,

481
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:39,681
但你才是专家 华生
but you're the expert, Watson.

482
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,140
根本不是什么专家 福尔摩斯
Hardly an expert, Holmes.

483
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,399
我刚刚看到"王子"在
I am aware of the Prince's bursts of speed

484
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:46,637
最后一弗隆(英国长度单位)的爆发力 但问题是
over a final furlong but the fact is

485
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:48,483
它没有在大赛上赢过
he hasn't yet won a major race.

486
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:50,828
你是否依然认为它有很大胜算?
Do you think he's still in with a good chance?

487
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:53,867
如果它已经充分准备 那么是的
If he's given the ground, then yes.

488
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:32,800
好吧 好吧 等一下
All right, all right, hold your horses.

489
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:35,060
我来了 我来了
I'm coming, I'm coming.

490
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:38,771
下午好
Good afternoon.

491
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:41,335
你一定是Stephens
You must be Stephens.

492
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:43,223
是的 先生
That's right, sir.

493
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,099
我是位医生
I'm a doctor.

494
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:47,512
Robert爵士让我一有时间
Well, Sir Robert asked me to call on his sister

495
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:48,457
就来拜访他的姐姐
at the first opportunity.

496
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,409
我刚到此地
I'm new to the area.

497
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:51,515
他没跟我说过 先生
Well, he said nothing about it to me, sir.

498
00:29:51,552 --> 00:29:52,925
他肯定是忘了
Well, he must have forgotten.

499
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:55,873
对于Robert爵士这样的大忙人来说一点不奇怪
Hardly surprising for a man as busy as Sir Robert.

500
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,349
恐怕夫人现在
I'm afraid her ladyship is out

501
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:00,648
在外面乘车兜风呢
taking her carriage exercise at the moment.

502
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:03,051
多长时间能回来呢?
How long is she likely to be?

503
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:05,479
不超过半小时 先生
Well, no more than half an hour, sir.

504
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:09,182
那这样的话 我不介意等着
Well, in that case I don't mind waiting.

505
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:16,156
看起来你也有病痛
You appear to be in some pain yourself.

506
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:19,819
是风湿病 先生
Well, it's the rheumatics, sir.

507
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:21,689
这把老骨头曾经
These old bones have taken a pounding

508
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:22,553
受过伤
in their time.

509
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,372
健康状况大不如前啦
Health's not what it was.

510
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,569
为什么不跟我说说呢?
Now, why don't you tell me about it?

511
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,073
您的意思是?
Beg pardon, sir?

512
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,007
既然我在这儿
Well, now that I'm here,

513
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:31,251
那不如看看我能帮上什么忙
I might as well make myself useful.

514
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:33,722
哦 你人真好 先生
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.

515
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,370
谢谢
Thank you.

516
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:38,516
是从我的手腕末端开始的
Well, it starts in the bottom of my wrist.

517
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:40,243
然后逐渐向上
And then it goes up.

518
00:30:40,281 --> 00:30:42,085
到肩膀?
In your shoulder?

519
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:50,077
"S.B."
S.B.

520
00:32:02,972 --> 00:32:04,959
当然 早晨一起床时
Of course, the worst time is

521
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:07,018
最难熬
first thing in the morning.

522
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,138
我的脖子和胳膊
My back and my legs,

523
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:12,125
哦 跟木板一样僵硬
oh, stiff as a board.

524
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,608
还有我的脚
And my feet,

525
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:18,553
我跟你说过我的脚吗?
did I tell you about my feet?

526
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,331
没有
No.

527
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:22,578
哦 我得跟你说说我的脚
Oh, I'll tell you about my feet.

528
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:25,304
冰块 就像冰块
Blocks of ice, like blocks of ice.

529
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:27,015
有时我都感觉不到脚的存在
Can't feel them sometimes.

530
00:32:27,052 --> 00:32:30,110
你的血液循环不顺畅
Your blood's not circulating properly.

531
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,017
是个常见问题
It's a common problem.

532
00:32:31,054 --> 00:32:36,779
还有另外一个问题
And then there's the other trouble.

533
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:41,457
另外一个问题?
The other trouble?

534
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:45,987
你知道的 另外一个问题
You know, the other trouble.

535
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:05,744
我试过各种方法
I've tried everything,

536
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:08,630
但都根本没什么起色
but it doesn't make any difference at all.

537
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:11,775
和以前一样痛苦
I'm in just as much agony now as I ever was.

538
00:34:28,145 --> 00:34:30,598
袖子卷起来吧
Roll it right up.

539
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,637
哦 那是夫人
Oh, that'll be her ladyship.

540
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:36,542
她回来早了
She's back early.

541
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:38,544
很抱歉 不过恐怕
Please excuse me, but I'm afraid

542
00:34:38,582 --> 00:34:42,073
我还有另一个紧急的门诊
I have another urgent appointment.

543
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,512
快到了 夫人
Almost there, my lady.

544
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,789
谢谢 Stephens 这就可以了
Thank you, Stephens, we'll be all right now.

545
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,018
谢谢 Stephens
Thank you, Stephens.

546
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:25,332
好吧 小姐
Right you are, Miss.

547
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:46,585
奇怪
Strange.

548
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:57,787
福尔摩斯 谢天谢地
Holmes, thank goodness.

549
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:59,741
幸亏卧室在底层
Fortunately, the bedroom is on the ground floor.

550
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:00,967
有什么新发现吗?
Did you have any luck?

551
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:02,735
一些事情还不明朗
A few things are still unclear,

552
00:36:02,773 --> 00:36:03,621
但我希望
but before the night is out,

553
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:05,323
在天明之前解决
I hope to have solved the mystery

554
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:07,533
Shoscombe别墅的谜题
of Shoscombe Old Place.

555
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:26,985
假设Samuel Brewer再来庄园要钱
If Samuel Brewer returned to the hall to demand his money,

556
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:28,483
他可能会在晚上来
he might have done so at night.

557
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,211
可能就是Robert爵士
He could have been the man

558
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:33,756
在老教堂所见的人
that Sir Robert met at the old church.

559
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:37,871
可能Robert爵士大发雷霆
Perhaps Sir Robert flew into one of his rages

560
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,293
并杀了他
and killed him,

561
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,218
在惊慌失措中
and in a moment of sheer panic

562
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,084
把他丢进炉子
tried to dispose of the body

563
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:45,888
以处理尸体
by putting it into the furnace.

564
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:48,949
因此 这个钱包(出现在了那里)
Hence, the note case.

565
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:51,798
华生 别动!
Watson, the vibrations!

566
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,030
或许我得承认
If perhaps maybe I admit

567
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:57,748
我们现在掌握的都是间接证据
all the evidence we have so far is purely circumstantial.

568
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:01,035
哦
Oh.

569
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,266
松香
Resin.

570
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,178
松香?
Resin?

571
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,192
含有酒精成分
On an alcohol base.

572
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:45,618
这是在Beatrice夫人的房间里
Traces of it on a few strands of hair

573
00:37:45,656 --> 00:37:48,431
找到的几根头发
found in Lady Beatrice's room.

574
00:37:50,946 --> 00:37:52,064
来 华生
Come, Watson.

575
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:53,016
电报可不会让
The telegram will not

576
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:55,039
Robert在那儿呆很久
keep Sir Robert away much longer.

577
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:56,853
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

578
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:13,802
Robert爵士
Sir Robert.

579
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:22,936
我不在的时候发生了什么事?
What happened while I was away?

580
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,488
没什么事 先生
Nothing, sir.

581
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:25,956
别骗我 Mason
Don't lie to me, Mason.

582
00:38:25,992 --> 00:38:30,093
有人在背着我干一些事
Something's been going on behind my back.

583
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:35,342
是不是有人在这附近盘问?
Has anyone been around here asking questions?

584
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,470
没有人 先生
No one, sir.

585
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:43,201
但我在Crendall附近遇到一些人
Apart from some people I met near Crendall.

586
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:47,477
我不知道他们的名字
I don't know their names.

587
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:49,346
你们说了些什么?
What did you talk about?

588
00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:51,299
没什么
Nothing much.

589
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:54,285
他们对老教堂很感兴趣
They were interested in the old church.

590
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:57,724
笨蛋!
Fool!

591
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:09,650
如果Samuel Brewer不是受害者
Well, if Samuel Brewer was not the victim,

592
00:39:09,688 --> 00:39:11,593
那为什么他的钱包
why was his note case found

593
00:39:11,594 --> 00:39:13,239
会在庄园的地下室里找到呢?
in the cellar of the hall?

594
00:39:13,276 --> 00:39:16,525
这里还有谁的名字是以S.B.开头的?
Who else in the household has the initials S. B?

595
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,429
S.B.... S.B.
S.B., S.B.

596
00:39:19,466 --> 00:39:21,716
Sandy Bain
Sandy Bain.

597
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:24,988
Harvey因为偷了别人的钱
Harvey was dismissed

598
00:39:25,026 --> 00:39:28,090
而被逐出了房子
for stealing from other members of the household.

599
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:29,807
他的职责之一
One of his duties

600
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:32,060
就是照看地下室的炉子
was to tend to the furnace in the cellar.

601
00:39:32,098 --> 00:39:34,455
事实上的确有尸体被烧了
Well, the fact remains that the body was burned.

602
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:36,898
如果那不是Brewer
If it wasn't Brewer's,

603
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:38,551
又会是谁?
then whose was it?

604
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:18,446
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

605
00:41:15,778 --> 00:41:17,330
在这样一个地方
What could you possibly be able to find

606
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:19,576
能找到什么呢?
in a place like this?

607
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:24,988
铅衬被切掉了
The lead lining's been cut.

608
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:38,647
不出我所料
Just as I thought.

609
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,743
螺钉松了
The bolts have been loosened.

610
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:49,401
华生 我需要你帮忙把这个打开
Watson, I'm going to need your help to open this.

611
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:51,695
福尔摩斯 这是亵渎神明啊
Holmes, that's desecration.

612
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:20,779
你是谁?
Who are you?

613
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,932
你动我的东西干什么?
What are you doing on my property?

614
00:42:23,971 --> 00:42:25,508
听见没有?
Do you hear?

615
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:26,216
你是谁?
Who are you?

616
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,705
你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

617
00:42:33,074 --> 00:42:34,980
哦
Oh.

618
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,465
啊 福尔摩斯先生
Ah, Mr. Holmes,

619
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,151
发生了什么事?
what's happened?

620
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,128
问得好 Mason先生
A good question, Mr. Mason.

621
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:11,791
问题直指Robert爵士
One that should be directed at Sir Robert.

622
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:16,164
啊 该死的装置
Oh, blasted contraptions.

623
00:43:18,237 --> 00:43:19,919
你怎么敢? 出去
How dare you? Get out.

624
00:43:19,957 --> 00:43:21,903
我本想跟你们一起喝茶的
I was going to join you for tea,

625
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,948
但我好像来晚了
but I see I'm too late.

626
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:26,737
马上出去 否则我就叫Robert爵士了
Get out this instant or I'll call for Sir Robert.

627
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:28,035
Robert爵士知道我在这儿
Sir Robert knows that I'm here.

628
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:30,965
Evans小姐 请坐下好吗?
Please, Miss Evans, will you sit down?

629
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:36,153
我想如果不来向Beatrice致敬
I felt I couldn't visit Shoscombe Old Place

630
00:43:36,192 --> 00:43:38,632
我就不能拜访Shoscombe别墅
without paying my respects to Lady Beatrice.

631
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,156
哦 你们喝茶的时候还喝白兰地
Oh, you have brandy with your tea?

632
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:50,148
当然是用来治疗的
For medicinal purposes, of course.

633
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:53,496
但这是不是足以让我好奇?
But is it enough I wonder?

634
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:55,009
好奇什么?
Enough for what?

635
00:43:55,046 --> 00:43:58,415
白兰地是用来恢复精神的
Brandy revives the spirits.

636
00:43:58,453 --> 00:44:00,444
我不认为这足够
I hardly think it is sufficient

637
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:02,989
用来唤醒死人
to raise the dead.

638
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:07,866
别动 Evans小姐
Don't move, Miss. Evans.

639
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,812
这样你就好受多了
That should be comfortable enough

640
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:55,569
等你自己的医生来吧
until your own doctor arrives.

641
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:57,065
谢谢
Thank you.

642
00:44:57,102 --> 00:44:58,670
我是夏洛克 福尔摩斯
I am Sherlock Holmes.

643
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,891
或许你对我的名字很熟悉
Perhaps my name is familiar to you.

644
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:04,788
或许表面看来并非如此
I know appearances are against me,

645
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:06,382
但你必须相信
but you must believe that

646
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,834
我别无选择
I could act in no other way.

647
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,695
我很高兴你这样说
I'm very happy to hear you say so.

648
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:12,072
但我恐怕你得跟
But I fear your explanations

649
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,182
警察解释这些了
must be for the police.

650
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,887
求你了 Robert爵士
Please, Sir Robert.

651
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:19,900
这些行为的一切责任都由我一人承担
The responsibility for what has  been done is entirely mine.

652
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:22,216
Evans小姐和Joe Barnes
Ms. Evans and Joe Barnes

653
00:45:22,254 --> 00:45:24,460
只是听从我的指示
were merely following my instructions.

654
00:45:24,497 --> 00:45:25,986
你必须保证他们不受伤害
You must promise that they will come to no harm.

655
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:28,108
我无法跟你保证任何事
I can promise you nothing.

656
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:33,458
但我愿意听一听事情的真相
But I will hear a plain statement of the facts.

657
00:45:33,494 --> 00:45:34,971
很好
Very well.

658
00:45:35,683 --> 00:45:37,201
显然你对我的事情
You've clearly gone pretty deeply

659
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:38,313
已经了如指掌
into my affairs,

660
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:41,048
否则我不会在那儿碰到你
otherwise I should not have found you where I did.

661
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:45,902
我始终清楚如果Beatrice去世
I've always known that if Beatrice died,

662
00:45:45,939 --> 00:45:47,654
地产将归由
the estate would revert

663
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:49,768
我姐夫的家人所有
to my brother-in-law's family.

664
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:50,922
所有东西都会被查封
Everything would be seized,

665
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:55,331
包括我的马厩和马匹
including the stables and the horses.

666
00:45:57,027 --> 00:45:58,369
福尔摩斯先生
Well, Mr. Holmes,

667
00:45:58,406 --> 00:45:59,750
我姐姐一周前
my sister did die,

668
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:01,904
的确去世了
just a week ago.

669
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:03,004
而你没告诉任何人?
And you told no one?

670
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:04,998
我没有多少选择余地
I had little alternative.

671
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:07,987
如果我公之于众 我将面对全面的破产
If I told the truth, I faced absolute ruin.

672
00:46:08,025 --> 00:46:11,368
如果我延迟到比赛之后公开
But if I could stave things off until the race,

673
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:13,665
我知道一切都会好转
I knew all might be well.

674
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:17,418
Beatrice死于长期困扰她的
Beatrice died of the heart condition

675
00:46:17,455 --> 00:46:19,004
心脏问题
that had long afflicted her.

676
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:22,163
这一点要由验尸官来确认
That will be for a coroner to decide.

677
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,330
她的医生可以证明
Her own doctor would certify that for months,

678
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:28,366
数月以来她的症状预示了这个结局
her symptoms had threatened such an end.

679
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:33,224
Joe Barnes在Beatrice去世前一两天
Joe Barnes came to see me in search of work

680
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:36,520
到我这里找工作
a day or two before Beatrice died.

681
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:38,523
他看起来是个值得信赖的孩子
He seemed a trustworthy lad,

682
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:41,496
所以我想到让他来
and it came into my mind that he might

683
00:46:41,534 --> 00:46:43,838
假扮我亲爱的姐姐
for a short time

684
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,149
一段时间
impersonate my dear sister.

685
00:46:46,186 --> 00:46:48,877
只要"她"每天出现在马车上
It was but a case of appearing daily in her carriage

686
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:51,406
因为没人会进她的房间
for no one need enter her room

687
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:52,726
除了Evans小姐
save Miss. Evans.

688
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:56,363
当然 我很信任她
Of course, I had to take her into my confidence.

689
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,078
整个骗局让我也很痛苦
The whole deception distressed me greatly,

690
00:47:00,115 --> 00:47:03,006
但想不到其他办法
but I could see no other course to take.

691
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:04,227
很自然
Naturally,

692
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:06,570
尸体不能存放在卧室里
the body couldn't remain in the bedroom.

693
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:11,227
第一天晚上
On the first night,

694
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:12,829
Joe和我把尸体抬出来
Joe and I carried it out

695
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:14,122
放到老磨坊里
to the old mill house.

696
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,898
她的宠物狗跟着我们
We were followed by her pet spaniel

697
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:21,380
并且之后它一直在门口狂吠
which afterwards howled continually at the door.

698
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:25,260
所以我觉得应该找个更安全的地方
So I felt some safer place was needed.

699
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:30,501
我赶走了狗
I got rid of the dog,

700
00:47:30,538 --> 00:47:32,187
我们把Beatrice
and we carried Beatrice

701
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,132
抬到教堂的地下室
to the crypt of the church.

702
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:37,941
我认为我们把她放在她丈夫的
It seemed to me to be no unworthy resting place

703
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:40,331
一位先人的棺材中作为其安息之所
if we put her for a time in the coffin

704
00:47:40,368 --> 00:47:42,484
并没有什么不妥
of one of her husband's ancestors

705
00:47:43,288 --> 00:47:46,854
她仍身处神圣之地
lying in what is still consecrated ground.

706
00:47:47,596 --> 00:47:50,785
我每天都去向她致意
I paid my respects to her there every day.

707
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:46,765
至于我们从棺材中
As to the old relics

708
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,839
取出的遗体
which we took from the coffin,

709
00:48:48,877 --> 00:48:51,017
Joe和我把它移走了
Joe and I removed them.

710
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:53,509
他晚上走出卧室并下楼
He descended from the bedroom at night

711
00:48:53,546 --> 00:48:56,732
在炉子里焚烧遗体
and burned them in the furnace.

712
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:04,548
设计这么的复杂的诡计真的有必要吗?
Was it necessarily to lay that monstrous trap?

713
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:06,094
我认为没人
I was determined that no one

714
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:09,556
可以打扰我姐姐安息
should disturb my sister's rest.

715
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:11,178
但你是怎么开始怀疑她的死的
But how you suspected her death

716
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:12,689
我想不到
I cannot imagine.

717
00:49:12,727 --> 00:49:14,458
是这样 昨天
Well, yesterday,

718
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:17,288
当Evans小姐命令马车夫开走时
when Miss. Evans ordered the carriage to drive on,

719
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:20,077
我推断她是在害怕什么
I concluded that she was afraid of something.

720
00:49:20,115 --> 00:49:24,401
我怀疑她怕的正是Jasper
I suspected that something was Jasper.

721
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:28,864
Evans小姐知道狗不会出错
Miss. Evans knew that dogs do not make mistakes.

722
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:32,285
它会认出那不是它的女主人
He would have known that it wasn't his mistress.

723
00:49:32,324 --> 00:49:34,173
但我们必须把此事交由警察
But we must leave all this for the police.

724
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:35,537
为什么?
But why?

725
00:49:35,574 --> 00:49:38,556
我只需要一两天
A day or two is all I need.

726
00:49:38,594 --> 00:49:40,418
求你保持沉默吧
Say nothing yet I beg of you.

727
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:43,218
只要比赛开始
The race will have been run,

728
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:46,102
我的噩梦就将结束
and my nightmare might be over.

729
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:50,142
我全身心地爱着Beatrice
I loved Beatrice with all my heart,

730
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:53,045
其中没有任何污辱或不敬
and there was no indignity or irreverence.

731
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:56,432
我不觉得我污辱了死者
I don't feel I have wronged the dead.

732
00:49:56,612 --> 00:49:59,157
我知道我的动机很自私
I realize that my motives were selfish,

733
00:50:00,594 --> 00:50:01,993
但我姐姐是不会希望
but my sister would not have wished

734
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,276
看到我破产的
to see me destroyed.

735
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:16,337
但这并不意味着你有权违反法律
That does not entitle you to break the law.

736
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:28,660
听听这个 福尔摩斯
Listen to this, Holmes.

737
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:32,070
在"Shoscombe王子"昨日夺得
Following the success of Shoscombe Prince

738
00:50:32,108 --> 00:50:34,083
冠军锦标赛的冠军之后
in yesterday's Champion Stakes,

739
00:50:34,122 --> 00:50:38,226
Robert爵士得到了足够丰厚的奖金
Sir Robert has received sufficient winnings

740
00:50:38,263 --> 00:50:40,276
偿还了所有债务
to settle all his debts

741
00:50:40,313 --> 00:50:42,738
并足够他重新过上
with enough left to reestablish him

742
00:50:42,775 --> 00:50:44,674
优越的生活
in a fair position in life.

743
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:45,499
啊
Ah.

744
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:49,755
然而 Robert爵士姐姐的
However, the victory was marred

745
00:50:49,793 --> 00:50:51,538
突然去世
by the sudden death

746
00:50:51,574 --> 00:50:53,021
冲淡了胜利的喜悦
of Sir Robert's sister,

747
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,159
Beatrice Folder夫人
Lady Beatrice Folder

748
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:56,603
至少与他一样
whose love of horses

749
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,473
热爱赛马
was at least as great as his own.

750
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:05,484
甚至是避难在外的Samuel Brewer
Even the elusive Samuel Brewer

751
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:08,336
也从其法国的避难所归来
has returned from his hideaway in France

752
00:51:08,374 --> 00:51:10,575
并发电报祝贺
to send a telegram of congratulations

753
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:13,436
Robert爵士的胜利
to Sir Robert on his win.

754
00:51:13,475 --> 00:51:15,540
这表明债权人
It transpires that even creditors

755
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:17,569
也还有自己的债权人啊
have their creditors.

756
00:51:17,606 --> 00:51:18,853
这解释了为什么Samuel Brewer
It explains why Samuel Brewer

757
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:20,822
那么急于要回自己的钱财
was so anxious to get his money back.

758
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,800
但发电报
But to send a telegram,

759
00:51:22,837 --> 00:51:26,580
真是赤裸裸的伪善
such a bare faced hypocrisy.

760
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:29,542
那你靠"Shoscombe王子"赢了多少钱?
So how much did you win on Shoscombe Prince?

761
00:51:31,246 --> 00:51:32,424
20吉尼(英国旧金币)
Twenty guineas.

762
00:51:32,462 --> 00:51:34,997
真可耻
That's disgraceful.

763
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,313
香槟 Hudson太太?
Champagne, Mrs. Hudson?

764
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:43,825
当然了 正合时宜啊
Of course, in the circumstances.

765
00:51:43,863 --> 00:51:45,035
哦 你真好
Well, that's very good of you,

766
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:46,828
但我只赢了20吉尼啊
but I've only won 20 guineas.

767
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:49,124
再加上我的10吉尼
Plus my ten.

768
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:51,685
你可不是唯一一个欲罢不能
You're not the only one that likes a plunge

769
00:51:51,723 --> 00:51:53,756
一次次去赌马的家伙 医生
on the horses from time to time, Doctor.

770
00:51:53,794 --> 00:51:56,997
哦 哈!
Oh, gee.
