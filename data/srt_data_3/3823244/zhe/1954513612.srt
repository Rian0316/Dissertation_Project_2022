1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,590
你最近在研究什么呢?
So, what are you working on these days?

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,420
我在研究单细胞微生物
I'm studying one-celled organisms

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,810
想找找看能引起羞耻感的
to try and find the neurochemicals

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,260
神经化学机制
that lead to the feeling of shame.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,710
一个单细胞微生物有什么好羞耻的?
What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,010
跟我们一样 没穿内衣就下车才会羞耻
Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,870
说到内衣
Speaking of underwear,

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,770
我有些有趣的事...
I have some interesting news...

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,650
好吧 如果是Howie穿了你内衣那事
Okay, if it's sometimes Howie wears yours,

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,910
Leonard已经告诉我们了
Leonard already told us.

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,260
他只是想搞笑
He was being funny.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,880
我很确定
I'm pretty sure.

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,650
话说回来 我被邀请接受采访
Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,820
那是篇关于加州五十位最性感女科学家的杂志报道
about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California.

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,990
很不错吧?
Isn't that cool?

16
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,460
我觉得糟透了
I think it's awful.

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,870
你为什么这么说?
Why would you say that?

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,690
Bernadette是个很成功的微生物学家
Bernadette is a successful microbiologist.

19
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,460
别人关注的应该是她的成就 而非长相
She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,350
我是说那会传达什么信息呢?
I mean, what kind of message does that send?

21
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,950
我觉得会是... "都来看看那漂亮的科学家"
I think the message is... "check out the rack on that scientist."

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,570
为什么一个人就不能智慧和美貌并存呢?
Why can't someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?

23
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,930
我只是觉得一个职业女性不应该通过
I just don't think a professional woman should have

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,830
夸耀自己的性别 换取出名的机会
to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,060
那又有什么关系?
Okay, what's the big deal?

26
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,650
听着 如果能帮我说服医师买我的药
Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician,

27
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,880
我觉得稍微调调情也无伤大雅
I don't think it hurts to flirt a little.

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,740
比如他们说笑话的时候笑笑 搭着他们的手臂
I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm,

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,820
也许可以提前打开车里的空调
maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know,

30
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,910
秀一秀事业线
to wake up the girls.

31
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,510
也许销售行业不一样
Maybe it's different in the world of sales,

32
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,760
但在科学领域
but it's already hard enough

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,900
已经很难人别人把女科学家当回事了
for women to be taken seriously in science.

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,370
我本来听说采访还挺兴奋的
I was kind of excited about the article,

35
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,090
但现在你让我觉得糟透了
but now you're making me feel bad.

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,770
不 我觉得你应该做想做的事情
No, I think you should do whatever you want.

37
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,170
要是时尚杂志里面
You know, maybe if fashion magazines had

38
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,390
有女科学家的话
female scientists in them,

39
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,190
我早就去当理论物理学家了
I would've become a theoretical physicist.

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,650
不准相视一笑
Stop smirking at each other.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,400
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,690
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

43
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,370
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

44
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,080
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,580
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

46
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,300
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

47
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,180
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

48
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,880
生活大爆炸 第八季第7集

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,490
不 应该谢谢你
No, thank you.

54
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,380
快递员是人们忘记赞美的
Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers

55
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,660
我国贸易领域的步兵
of our nation's commerce.

56
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,500
正是有了你们这样的人
It's because of people like you,

57
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,170
我这样的人才能减少与他人接触
people like me can limit our human contact.

58
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,920
我想跟你握手的 不过还是算了吧
I'd shake your hand, but, well, you know.

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,420
我不是快递员 我... 是医生
I'm not a delivery man, I... I'm a doctor.

60
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,180
虽然我的确经常给患者
Although I do often deliver

61
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,350
送紧急活体检验报告
alarming biopsy results to my patients.

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,320
你真幽默
That's humorous.

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,350
好吧
All right.

64
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,360
我... 打赌你给患者缝针
Yeah, I... I bet you leave your patients in stitches.

65
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,360
我也挺幽默的
That was also humorous.

66
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,110
好吧
All right.

67
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,290
你带花给病人
Are you bringing flowers to a patient

68
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,120
是为了缓解末期诊断的打击吗?
to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis?

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,510
刚才那个不是笑话
That wasn't a joke.

70
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,470
好吧
All right.

71
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,390
这话是给一位打销售电话
These are actually for a nice woman

72
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,440
到我办公室的优秀女人的
who makes sales calls to my office.

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
恩
Hmm.

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,690
要知道 这事有快递员
You know, they have delivery people

75
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,810
可以帮你做的
that will do that for you.

76
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,730
我想通过上网人肉她
I was hoping to impress her

77
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,230
突然出现在她家门口
by tracking her down on the Internet

78
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,870
给她留个好印象
and then showing up unannounced at her door.

79
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,900
特别努力一把
Making the extra effort.

80
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,740
祝你好运
Good for you.

81
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,420
正好 外卖刚到
Great timing, food just got here.

82
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,080
- 哦 Siam Palace的?  - 没错
- Ooh, Siam Palace?  - Yes.

83
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,250
- 炒米粉和沙爹鸡?  - 没错
- Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?  - Yes.

84
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,170
- 多加了花生酱?  - 没有 不过你可以吃我的
- Uh, extra peanut sauce?  - No, but you can have mine.

85
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,510
好 很好
Eh, well, very well.

86
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,980
说到要分享你的事情
Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours,

87
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,480
现在有位男士
there is a gentleman caller

88
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,070
正在给你的未婚妻送花
bringing flowers to your fiancee as we speak.

89
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,770
什么?
What?

90
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,610
你干嘛不先说?
Why didn't you say that first?

91
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,160
你干嘛不给我多拿花生酱?
Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce?

92
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,240
我们都可以这么玩
We can both play this game.

93
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,700
有什么事吗?
Can I help you?

94
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,860
你好
Oh, hi.

95
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,500
Penny住这里吗?
Uh, does Penny live here?

96
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,620
有什么事吗?
May I ask why?

97
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,000
呃...
Well, uh...

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,370
我... 是在办公室认识她的 她对我抛了媚眼
I... I met her at my office, she winked at me.

99
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,460
所以...
And, uh...

100
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,800
我来... 是想开始一段浪漫的感情
I... I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.

101
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,470
好吧...
Okay, um...

102
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,770
听着 我很确定她没对你抛媚眼
Look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.

103
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,550
她抛了
Oh, she did.

104
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,520
像这样 超诱惑
Seductively, like this.

105
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,280
然后她搭了我的手臂两秒钟
And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis.

106
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,900
就像这样 一秒 两秒...
Like, you know, one Mississippi, two...

107
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,780
我懂了 我懂了
I got it, I got it.

108
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,990
听着...
Listen, um...

109
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,490
我觉得你肯定是误会了
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

110
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,460
Penny是我的未婚妻
See, Penny is my fiancee.

111
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,660
真的?
Really?

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,580
但我没看她戴订婚戒指呀
I've never seen her wear an engagement ring.

113
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,330
真的?
Really?

114
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,470
那我可以认为
So, am I to presume

115
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,510
她的调情是一种销售手段吗?
that her flirtation was just a sales technique?

116
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,340
就是这样
I think so.

117
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,350
我什么时候才能吸取教训?
When will I learn?

118
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,400
跟上次宠物店可爱女孩的时候完全一样
It's just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.

119
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,270
你说什么?
Excuse me?

120
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,410
她搭了我的手臂五秒钟
Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis,

121
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,280
我就买了套两千块的鬣鳞蜥饲养缸
and I bought a $2,000 iguana habitat.

122
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,370
结果她一直说忙 都不来看看
Which she was always too busy to come over and see.

123
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,370
请把这个给Penny
You give these to Penny.

124
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,340
你真是个幸运的男人
You're, you're a lucky man.

125
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,340
谢谢
Thank you.

126
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,290
抱歉
Sorry.

127
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,130
哦...
Oh, uh...

128
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,100
你大概不想让她看到这个
you probably don't want her to see this.

129
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,050
里面的图生动过头了
It's unnecessarily graphic.

130
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,220
等等 医生
Hold on, Doctor.

131
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,220
Leonard 你的社交礼仪哪儿去了?
Leonard, where are your social skills?

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,190
这位先生显然很伤心
This man is clearly upset.

133
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,390
我们应该请他进去喝杯热饮
We should invite him in for a hot beverage.

134
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,400
他想勾搭Penny
He tried to score with Penny.

135
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,570
这两位也勾搭过 他们还跟我们吃完饭呢
So have these two, and they're having dinner with us.

136
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,580
今天工作怎么样?
So, how was work today?

137
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,630
不错 但你应该会很高兴
It was fine, but you'll be happy to know

138
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,580
他们撤消了那篇性感科学家的报道
they pulled the sexy scientists article.

139
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,080
怎么了?
What happened?

140
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,170
我也不知道
I don't know.

141
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,170
他们取消了拍摄
They just canceled the photo shoot

142
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,300
说要再考虑一下
and said they're rethinking it.

143
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,640
真的很抱歉
Well, I'm really sorry,

144
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,760
不过我觉得这样最好
but I think it's for the best.

145
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,140
你应该希望人们更关注你的学术成就
You want people focusing on your achievements,

146
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,480
而不是盯着杂志看你的胸
not staring at your breasts in some magazine.

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
我知道
I guess.

148
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,100
这真的不重要
It's really not that important.

149
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,230
嘿 别看了
Hey, up here.

150
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,610
不好意思... 说着说着就看上了
Sorry, we're... we were talking about them.

151
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,080
其实... 我本来不打算告诉你的
So, look, I... I wasn't going to say anything,

152
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,580
不过既然你对撤稿这件事看的这么开
but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled,

153
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,780
我觉得应该告诉你实话
I have a little confession.

154
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,180
是我让他们撤下这篇文章的
I'm the reason it was pulled.

155
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,090
什么? 怎么回事?
What? How?

156
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,200
我给杂志编辑
I sent the editors of the magazine

157
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,920
写了一封言辞激烈的邮件
a pretty scathing e-mail.

158
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,540
Amy 你说了什么?
Amy, what did you say?

159
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,460
我不过是指出
I simply pointed out

160
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,210
他们绝对不会发表一篇
that they would never consider doing an article

161
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,510
男科学家性感程度的排名
ranking male scientists on their sexuality,

162
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,470
更不可能拍他们暴露身体的照片
let alone showing them in various stages of undress.

163
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,520
因为没人会愿意看Neil deGrasse Tyson(美国男科学家)
Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson

164
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,060
穿着湿T恤在保时捷车旁边凹造型
in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.

165
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,310
无所谓啦
Well, it doesn't make a difference,

166
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,730
反正他们也觉得这样不太好
because they agreed it was in bad taste,

167
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,310
而且现在你也同意了 所以...
and now you agree, so...

168
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,530
Amy做得对哦
Amy saves the day.

169
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,450
不 是你嫉妒我了
No, what happened was you got jealous,

170
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,900
所以你夺走了让我增加曝光率的一个机会
so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.

171
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,910
又不是好曝光
But it was bad publicity.

172
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,910
那也是我来决定 不是你
That's for me to decide, not you.

173
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,880
我不同意
I disagree.

174
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,710
作为一名女性科学家 你的所作所为也会影响到我们其他人
As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.

175
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,050
可是我觉得你不喜欢别人
And I think you don't like people

176
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,170
展示她们性感的一面
expressing their sexuality

177
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,840
是因为没人觉得你性感
because no one wants you to express yours.

178
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,810
Amy 不好意思
Oh, Amy, I'm so sorry.

179
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,310
我太过分了
That was over the line.

180
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,560
你自己好好待着吧
You have a nice night.

181
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,010
求求你 别走啊
Please don't go.

182
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,850
就算我说的有点过分 也是你不对在先的
Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.

183
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,240
给你 医生
Here you go, Doctor.

184
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,020
这是加了一勺蜂蜜的热花茶
Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.

185
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,020
谢谢
Thank you.

186
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,190
星际迷航的马克杯 不错嘛
Neat Star Trek mug.

187
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,780
其实我有一个原版电视剧里
I actually have one of the phasers

188
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,910
演员们用的那个杯子
from the original TV show.

189
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,500
这么酷炫
Oh, cool.

190
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,750
你怎么拿到的?
How'd you get that?

191
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,120
简单的很 Gene Roddenberry要做切除输精管的手术
Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.

192
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,170
等下
Wait a minute.

193
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,920
你剪过Gene Roddenberry的输精管?
You've snipped Gene Roddenberry's vas deferens?

194
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,710
对啊
Yes.

195
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,130
哇哦 他还真是到过无人之境啊
Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.

196
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,050
不是我爱吹牛 可是
I don't like to brag, but, uh, you see,

197
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,110
我是个专为明星做泌尿系统手术的医生
I'm kind of the doctor to the stars' urinary tracts.

198
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,360
哇哦
Wow.

199
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,230
诶 你们要不要看看詹姆斯·卡梅隆的肾结石?
Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron's kidney stone?

200
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,740
嗷啊
Ooh.

201
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,660
手术之后他特别开心 就给了我一个终结者
He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.

202
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,580
太赞了啊
That is amazing.

203
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,960
你收集这些东西有多久了?
How long have you been collecting?

204
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,800
我从小就开始收集这些东西
Ever since I was a kid,

205
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,630
不过直到William Shatner膀胱感染的时候
but, uh, I didn't really get serious

206
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,420
才开始对收藏认真起来 
until William Shatner's bladder infection.

207
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,050
你那次拿到了什么? 拿到了什么?
What'd you get? What'd you get?

208
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,840
他说那是星际迷航里的Tribble小毛球
Well, he said it was a Tribble.

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,090
也没准是假发呢
It could be a toupee,

210
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,060
不过不管怎么说都蛮不错啦
but either way, it's pretty cool.

211
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,760
我... 我好想去看看你的藏品啊
I... I would love to see your collection.

212
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,430
随时欢迎
Anytime.

213
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,680
我那确实还有不少好东西
Uh, I've got some cool stuff.

214
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,230
最开始的时候
When I first started,

215
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,190
我以为收集这些东西能帮我泡妹
I thought it would be a good way to meet women,

216
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,190
不过 你们懂的...
but, well, you know...

217
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,860
- 人艰不拆  - 我们懂的
- Sure. Preach.  - We know.

218
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,080
我能问你个私人问题吗?
Can I ask you a personal question?

219
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,410
问吧
Sure.

220
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,170
呃 你和我是一类人
Um, I mean, you're a guy like me,

221
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,720
那你是怎么追到Penny的?
so how'd you get a girl like Penny?

222
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,360
哦
Oh.

223
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,960
这个嘛 就是...
Well, you know, just...

224
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,540
做自己 真的
being myself, really.

225
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,760
快别装了!
Oh, please!

226
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,210
我告诉你他是怎么做的吧
You know, I'll tell you how he did it.

227
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,970
就是无休无止的死缠烂打
Implacable, relentless badgering.

228
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,050
用泌尿学术语来说
In urology terms,

229
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,860
他就像是有抗药性的葡萄球菌
he was a drug-resistant staph infection.

230
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,760
Penny是对他没有抵抗力的尿道
And she was a urethra that could not shake him.

231
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,360
我倒不会用病菌形容自己
I don't know that I'd call myself an infection.

232
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,450
真男人这时候应该觉得他的未婚妻
A gallant man would defend his fiance

233
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,400
不应该被说成是尿道吧
for being called a urethra.

234
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,960
咱们能换个话题吗?
Can we please change the subject?

235
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,120
嗨
Hi.

236
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,130
看来 这话题换不了了
Well, that didn't go your way.

237
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,160
Lorvis医生 你怎么会在这里?
Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?

238
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,050
呃 我其实是来找你的
Uh, well, actually I came to see you.

239
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,500
真的吗? 为什么啊?
Really? Why?

240
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,720
呃 这个问题问得好
Ah, that's a good question.

241
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,590
显然有些人由于在不戴订婚戒指的时候
Apparently someone was being awfully flirty

242
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,180
有强烈的和别人调情的嫌疑
while not wearing their engagement ring,

243
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,680
导致另一个人出现在这里
causing another someone to show up

244
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,780
而且还觉得第一个人可以成为他的女朋友
here thinking the first someone might be available.

245
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,810
天啊 别难为她了
Oh, God. Don't make it so hard on her.

246
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,570
听着 第一个人是不诚实的你
Look, the first someone is the deceitful you.

247
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,240
第二个人是
The second someone

248
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,610
超赞的Lorvis医生
is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.

249
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,190
哦 这太尴尬了
Oh, this is very embarrassing.

250
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,190
Lorvis医生 真对不起
Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry.

251
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,240
我不是故意想勾引你的
I did not mean to lead you on.

252
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,670
你摸我胳膊摸了两秒那么久呢
You touched my arm for two Mississippis.

253
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,950
哦
Oh.

254
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,450
怪不得你当时在数数
That's why you were mumbling "Mississippi."

255
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,120
我们能单独谈谈吗?
Can we talk in private?

256
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,010
当然
Please, yes.

257
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,010
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

258
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,790
那么 
So what other

259
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,630
你还接手过哪些名人的生殖器?
celebrity genitalia have you handled?

260
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,520
这到底是怎么回事?
So, uh, what's the deal?

261
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,550
你工作的时候不戴订婚戒指?
You take off your ring when you go to work?

262
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,050
什么? 才不是!
What? No! No!

263
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,850
我就是换到另一只手上...
I just put it on the other hand and...

264
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,310
把戒指反过来
turn it around.

265
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,860
然后把手插兜里
Keep that hand in my pocket.

266
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,190
为什么啊?
Why?

267
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,230
什么叫为什么?
Well, what do you mean why?

268
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,310
是这样的 如果医生觉得我是单身的话
Look, I make more sales

269
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,610
我能卖出去更多药
if these doctors think I'm single.

270
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,230
我当服务生的时候也这么干过
I did the same kind of thing as a waitress.

271
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,120
问题在于 他在你们家里做什么?
The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?

272
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,370
哦 他有点失落
Oh, he was upset.

273
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,960
所以Sheldon请他来家里喝热饮
So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.

274
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,240
你觉得这样没问题吗?
You were okay with that?

275
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
不 我超级不爽!
No. I got upset!

276
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,380
然后Sheldon给我也做了一杯热饮
And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.

277
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,580
好吧 他就这样冲过来找我
Okay, he just showed up at my door.

278
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,920
你不觉得这样有点诡异吗?
Don't you think that's a little weird?

279
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,550
是有点 不过... 他还挺无害的
A little, but... he's basically harmless.

280
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,420
- 他其实是个好人  - 好吧
- He's actually kind of a nice guy.  - Okay.

281
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,140
不管怎么说 我们公司不允许我们
Whatever, look, my company does not allow me

282
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,590
在工作之外和医生们有私人接触
to socialize with doctors outside of work.

283
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,840
你赶紧把他甩了
You got to get rid of him.

284
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,480
为什么要我去甩?
Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?

285
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
我做不到! 他是我最好的客户!
I can't do it! He's my best client!

286
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,770
好吧 我去赶他
All right, I'll get rid of him.

287
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,680
但这算你欠我的
But you owe me one.

288
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,940
嘿 我们去Oliver家看他的收藏
Hey, we're going to Oliver's house to see his collection.

289
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
你想和我们一起去吗?
You want to go with us?

290
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,860
当然
Yeah, sure.

291
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,530
你欠我的
You owe me.

292
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,280
我的亲娘啊!
Oh, my God!

293
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,020
Leonard 我错了
Leonard, I was wrong.

294
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,620
天堂是存在的
Heaven does exist.

295
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,760
它在Sherman Oaks的泌尿科医师家
And it's in the basement of a urologist's house

296
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,260
的地下室里
in Sherman Oaks.

297
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,430
欢迎来到我的孤单城堡
Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude.

298
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,180
这是我逃避...
This is where I go to get away from...

299
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,970
我其他孤单时刻的地方
all my other solitude.

300
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,600
不是吧 肯定是个复制品
Oh, come on. It's a replica.

301
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,060
原版的
Original.

302
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,000
我感觉我刚刚肉体出轨了
Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.

303
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,900
这是地狱公爵的枪?
The gun from Hellboy?

304
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,120
是的
Yup.

305
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,290
你怎么拿到的?
How did you get it?

306
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,450
我在一场拍卖会上买到的
Bought it at auction.

307
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,740
哦 我以为这里面有什么关于
Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit

308
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,660
Ron Perlman的睾丸的有趣的故事
about Ron Perlman's testicles.

309
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,330
Oliver! 我要玩宾果了!
Oliver! I'm going to play bingo!

310
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,250
好的 妈妈 玩的开心
Okay, Mother. Have fun.

311
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,500
他还和他妈住一起
Still lives with his mom.

312
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,420
真恶心 是吧?
Yikes, right?

313
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,020
嗯 你这句话我真是无言以对
Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.

314
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,680
哇 大金刚!
Wow, Donkey Kong!

315
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,890
这... 这是我小时候最爱的游戏!
This... this was my game when I was a kid!

316
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,850
因为它是一个
Because it's a story

317
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,560
关于一个漂亮的金发女孩
of a pretty blonde girl

318
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,770
被一个体型奇怪的小人坚持不懈地追求的故事?
tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?

319
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,910
不 因为我喜欢它
No, because I liked it.

320
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,870
别太敏感了
Well, now, don't get defensive.

321
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,340
虽然你体型奇怪 但是你追到女孩了啊
You're oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.

322
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,360
我发现Leonard经常因为
So, I've noticed Leonard gets teased a lot

323
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,870
他和Penny的关系被嘲弄 
about his relationship with Penny.

324
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,250
是的 如果你想一起笑他
Yes. If you'd like to join in,

325
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,510
包袱就是他们的爱情看上去不靠谱 而且必然会失败
the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.

326
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,830
所以 你觉得她马上就会变单身了?
So, you think she'll be single soon?

327
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,040
如果你想等着
Oh, if you want to get in on the pool,

328
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,350
那就太晚了...
you're too late...

329
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,210
队都排到看不见了
All the squares have been purchased.

330
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,000
有趣
Interesting.

331
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,050
不好意思 我要先走了
Excuse me, I have to take care of something.

332
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,150
Leonard 作为你的朋友
Leonard, as your friend I feel

333
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,730
- 我觉得我需要跟你说一件事  - 什么事?
- I should tell you something.  - What?

334
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,140
你没多要花生酱 我还是不太开心
I'm still upset about that peanut sauce.

335
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,240
你能扶着门吗?
Oh, could you hold the door?

336
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,460
- 花不错  - 谢谢
- Nice flowers.  - Thank you.

337
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,000
是为一个女孩准备的
They're for a girl.

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,920
我准备做出坚决不放弃的姿态
Uh, I'm being implacable and relentless.

339
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,550
她真幸运
Isn't she lucky?

340
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,640
她总是给我矛盾的信号
She keeps sending me mixed signals.

341
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,090
但我... 我觉得我们两个人想要的东西是一样的
But I-I think we both want the same thing.

342
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,260
什么?
What's that?

343
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,260
无私的爱
Unconditional love.

344
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,900
我猜所有人都想要那个吧
I guess that's all anybody wants.

345
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,430
我想也是
I guess so.

346
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,520
祝你有一天能得到它
Well, I hope you get it.

347
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,070
一秒 两秒
One Mississippi, two Mississippi.

348
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,800
下一局我们把头盔换过来玩吧
Next game, let's switch helmets.

349
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,780
不行 我戴着那个头盔很二
No, I'd look silly in that helmet.

350
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,370
我... 我不能拿这些
I-I can't take these.

351
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,430
为什么?
Well, why not?

352
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,880
你要的和我要的是一样的
I mean, you want what I want.

353
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,760
我们一起度过了两秒美妙的时刻
And we had two wonderful Mississippis.

354
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,970
但是 那个女孩怎么办?
But what about the other girl?

355
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,690
对哦
Oh, right.

356
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,800
我会告诉她
I'll tell her

357
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,890
我和她还是做朋友比较好
we should just be friends.

358
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,980
Lorvis医生 你怎么来了?
Dr. Lorvis?

359
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,310
Penny 我们还是只做朋友吧
Penny, we should just be friends.

360
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,170
高兴了吗?
Happy?

361
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,800
你觉得他会咬人吗?
You think he bites?

362
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,580
把你的手伸进去试试看
Stick your hand in there and find out.

363
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,920
宠物园的那头山羊那里 你就骗过我
You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo.

364
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,470
你再也骗不到我了
You will not fool me again.

365
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,430
我在想Lorvis医生在哪里
I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is.

366
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,680
他已经走了有一段时间了
He's been gone a while.

367
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,180
他可能在和他妈咪在玩宾果
Maybe he's playing bingo with his mommy.

368
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,230
有些人断不了奶
It's sad how some guys

369
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,100
真是令人伤心
can't cut the apron strings.

370
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,840
现在你是跟我开玩笑吧
Okay, now you're messing with me.

371
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,990
额 大伙们 我们被锁在里面了
Uh, guys, we're locked in here.

372
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,860
哦 今天真是越来越棒了!
Oh, this day just keeps getting better!

373
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,650
所以你就把他们留在你家玩游戏?
So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?

374
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,670
他们看上去挺快乐的 而且...
Well, they seemed happy and...

375
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,670
我以为这样做可以
I thought that would give me time

376
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,540
给我一点时间 和你互相了解一下
for you and I to get to know each other better.

377
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,100
那是在我们见面之前的事了
That was before we met.

378
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,270
我们都有过去
We all have a past.

379
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,890
医生 你一定要明白你做的事
Doc, you've got to see what you're doing

380
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,660
有... 有点让人毛骨悚然
is-is a little creepy.

381
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,090
Sigourney Weaver说过一样的话
You sound just like Sigourney Weaver

382
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,690
在我跟着她走进厕所之后
when I followed her into a restroom.

383
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,030
好了 你们不能去追
Okay, you can't just go chasing after

384
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,800
所有对你们好的女孩
every girl who's nice to you.

385
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,530
那可不是Sheldon说的 
Well, that's not what Sheldon says.

386
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,620
他好像在女孩子当中很吃得开
And he seems to know his way around the ladies.

387
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,330
嘿 Leonard 猜猜谁回来了!是Lorvis医生!
Hey, Leonard. Guess who's back! Dr. Lorvis!

Yeah. You care to join us?

389
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,960
什么?!
What?!

390
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,460
你把他们锁在你的地下室里了?!
You locked them in your basement?!

391
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,670
其实 他们... 他们不是被锁在里面了
Well, they're, they're not locked in.

392
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,240
只是那个门很难开
The door just sticks.

393
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,520
那他们怎么才能把它打开?
Okay, so how do they unstick it?

394
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,310
他们需要钥匙
They'd need the key.

395
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,260
好的
Okay.

396
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
没 没别的事了
Nope. That's it.

397
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,060
我们现在就过去
We are gonna go over there right now.

398
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,270
你得把他们放出来
And you are going to let them out.

399
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,740
三秒 四秒...
Three Mississippi, four Mississippi...

400
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,650
快走!
Move it!

401
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,440
哦 幸亏你们在这里
Oh, good, you're here.

402
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,360
Amy 对不起
Amy, I am so sorry.

403
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,080
等等再说 这个怪胎把
That has to wait. This weirdo locked

404
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,170
- 男孩们锁在他的地下室了  - 什么?!

405
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,830
- 她看上去人挺好的 她是谁?  - 赶紧走
- She seems nice. Who's she?  - Just walk.

406

加油
You can do this.

407
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,390
还剩下最后一个梯子!
One ladder left!

408
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,270
哦耶!太棒了!
Oh-ho! Yeah! Yes!

409
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,520
下一关!
Next level!

410
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,560
- Leonard 你还好吗?  - 简直不能再好了
- Leonard, are you okay?  - Better than okay.

411
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,890
人生有史以来打过最爽的游戏!
I am having the game of my life!

412
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,610
Lorvis医生 你有什么想说的吗?
Dr. Lorvis, isn't there something you want to say?

413
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,900
是的
Yes.

414
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,070
我很抱歉把你们锁在我家里了
I'm very sorry for locking you in my home.

415
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,200
是的 这事做得很不地道
Yeah, that was very uncool.

416
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
拿榔头! 赶紧拿榔头!
Get the hammer! Get the hammer!

417
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,220

Got it.

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,160
等... 等等!
J-Just hang on!

420
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,750
好吧 我们要不一边等
Well, while we wait,

421
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,200
一边看Tobey Maguire的前列腺声像图?
would you like to see Tobey Maguire's prostate sonogram?

422
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,420
好啊
Sure. Yeah.

423
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,970
对了 我要剧透了哦
Oh, spoiler alert.

424
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,590
他白担心了
Uh, he was worried about nothing.
