try with the little ones.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,430
Penny,please.
Penny 别说了

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,480
We're facing a far more serious
problem than stray arachnids.
这问题可比迷路严重得多

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,720
- Sheldon,it's not so bad.
- Not bad? It's horrible.
- Sheldon 没有那么糟
- 不糟? 简直是恐怖!

00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,480
I mean,you hear stories about this sort of
thing, but you never think it'll happen to you.
这种事时常听到
但啥时候想到会发生在自己身上

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,290
So they steamed your
dumplings. Get over it.

you are looking particularly ravishing today.

你今天可真是迷死人啊

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,120

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,500
Why would you just say
something like that?
你为什么要这样说话?

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,600
No,no,no, no,no,no,no...
不不不...

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,090
How else was I supposed to say it?
那我还能怎么个说法?

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,960
Slowly. Like putting a new fish in
a tank. You don't just drop it in.
有点铺垫嘛 就像把金鱼放进鱼缸
不是一下子就把它扔进去吧

23
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,310
You let the bag sit
in the water a while.
你得把袋子在水里放一会儿

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,420

Sheldon,I'm sure it's going to be fine.

No,it's not going to be
fine. Change is never fine.

They say it is, but it's not.
人们这么说 但事实并非如此

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,070
Okay,honey,did you even know
the people that are moving out?
亲爱的 你认识那些要搬走的人么?

29

I never met them. That's
what made them perfect.
我从没见过他们 所以他们才如此完美

30

There were no awkward
"hellos" in the halls.
不用尴尬地在走廊里打招呼

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,830
There's no clickety-clacking of
high heel shoes on hardwood floors.
没有硬木地板上咔嗒咔嗒的高跟鞋声

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,150
They may as well have been a family of cats
just jumping around from drape to drape.
他们也可能是一窝猫
在帘子间跳来跳去

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,010
Without that annoying
ammonia urine smell.
但他们没有烦人的尿骚味

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,980
Well,I'm sure the new
people will be just as quiet.

can you possibly know that?

36
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,300
You're right,I can't. You know what?
你说得没错 我不知道 你知道吗?

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,050
Anyone could rent that apartment now:
an opera singer, the cast ofStomp...
谁都有可能租下那间公寓
歌剧演员 街舞少年剧组的...

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,300
Yeah,a tap-dancing
pirate with a wooden leg.
对哈 装着个木腿踢踏舞演员

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,060
Why are you making it worse?

40
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,990
I tried making it better.
He wouldn't go for it.

- What?
- I'll take the apartment upstairs.
- 什么?
- 我要租下楼上的公寓

we can all spend some more time together.

expect me to believe

136
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,550
"It's a trap."

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,170
Come.

138
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,760
Congratulations, I see
you did your laundry.
恭喜啊 你衣服洗好了

139
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,490
Well,sort of.
呃 算是吧

140
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,240
- How does one "sort of..."
- I bought new clothes,okay?
- 要怎么"算是..."呢?
- 我买了新衣服 好了吧?

141
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,010
Is Leonard around?
Leonard在吗?

142
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,020
He's upstairs at Alicia's.
他在楼上Alicia那儿

143
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,490
All right, that's cool,no biggie.
好吧 没事 没什么大不了

144
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,650
He said he'd help me set up my
printer, but I guess I can wait.
他说他会帮我装打印机的
不过我想我可以等等

145
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,600
What exactly is he doing up there?
他究竟在上头干什么呢?

146
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,860
In what I can only perceive as
a tactical move to destroy me,
我只能理解为是
用来摧毁我的战术性行动

147
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,480
he is with Wolowitz and
Koothrappali setting up her stereo.
他和Wolowitz还有Koothrappali
在帮她装立体声系统

148
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,220
Oh,they're all up
there,huh? Hmm,typical.
噢 他们都在上头 哈? 典型啊

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
It's axiomatically atypical.
显然非典型啊

150
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,710
Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and
had no encounters with her in a previous location.
直到最近 他们还不认识Alicia
以前也没有在哪儿见过她

151
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,870
They never went upstairs
to visit the former tenants,
他们从来不上楼去看以前的房客

152
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,390
so your characterization of their behavior
as "typical" is demonstrably fallacious.
所以你将他们的行为归为"典型"
显然是谬论

153
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,400
Okay,now I see the giant squid head.
好了 现在我看见巨型鱿鱼脑袋了

154
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,900
Oh,great! Now,I have
to start all over again.
这下好了! 我得从头再来一遍

155
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,330
Yeah,I thought about
renting this apartment,
没错 我还想租下这间公寓呢

156
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,790
but I'm really more of a
"downtown loft" kind of guy.
但我更喜欢住"市区阁楼"

157
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Cool. So are you in a loft now?
真酷 那么说你现在住阁楼咯?

158
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,540
Oh,actually,I'm,uh,living
with a woman in Altadena.
噢 实际上 我现在和一个女人
一起住在Altadena

159
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,390
Purely platonic. She's also my maid.
纯柏拉图式的 她也是我的女仆

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,060
Sounds like a sweet deal.
听起来不错啊

161
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,730
I won't lie. It's pretty dope.
不骗你哦 挺无聊的

162
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,540

167
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,300
The guys have been helping
me set up my sound system.
他们在帮我组装音响系统

168
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,620
I've never had such
good-looking technical support.

169
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,880

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,930
I don't know, it means shucks.
管它呢 就是不咋靓的意思呗

171
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,200
"Shucks" means shucks.
Let one go once in a while.
不靓就是不靓嘛 您老别总那么较真成不

172
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,830
- Hey,uh,Penny,you want to hear something awesome?
- Yeah.
- Penny 有个消息很赞 想听不?
- 说啊

173
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,720
Alicia is an actress, just like you.
Alicia是名演员 和你一样

174
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,470
That is so awesome.
真太赞了

175
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,570
Well,trying to be, but it's so hard.
努力做演员 但真的很难啊

commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.
只不过接了几个商业广告
和一部肥皂剧的循环角色

所以我一直在在"酪饼工厂"工作
就是在等好角色啊

180
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,100

setting for DVDs,5. 1 Dolby or DTS?
Alicia 你要怎样的DVD默认设置
杜比5.1还是DTS?

181
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,030
Whatever you think is best,cutie.

182
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,680
Well,DTS has more low end,so...
DTS有更多低档环绕扬声器 所以...

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,230

really appreciate this.

joke on the Internet.

Alicia 你不会理解的 但很对他们胃口

into an ice cream parlor every week

sundae for himself,

and then offers one to the
empty stool sitting next to him.
然后给他旁边的空位点一份

190
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,260
This goes on for a while until the
owner finally asks him what he's doing.
这情况持续了一段时间
直到最后老板问他在干嘛

191
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,460
The man says, "Well,I'm a
physicist, "and quantum mechanics...
那家伙说 "我是个物理学家
而量子力学呢..."

192
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,950
teaches us "that it is possible
for the matter above this stool
"告诉我们这位子上的物体有可能"

193
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,940
"to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who
might accept my offer and fall in love with me."
"自然地转化成一个漂亮的姑娘
接受我的请客并与我坠入爱河"

194
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,030
The owner then says, "Well,lots of single,
"beautiful women come in here ever day.
老板说"这儿每天有很多单身美女客人"

them, and they might fall in love with you?"
"你干嘛不给其中一位买份冰淇淋呢
她们也许会与你坠入爱河啊"

196
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,000
And the physicist says, "Yeah,but
what are the odds of that happening?"
物理学家答道
"是啊 但又有多大可能呢?"

197
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,010
It's a little insulting,
don't you think?
这笑话有点伤人 不是吗?

198
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,420
How would I know? I'm
not even sure I get it.

199

Hey,Leonard?

婀娜小脚在走来走去

occurs in beehives you might find interesting.
知道吗 Penny 蜂窝里的事你也许会感兴趣

有时 在老蜂后仍掌权时
会有一个新蜂后到来

217
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,860

must either locate to a new hive

or engage in a battle to the
death until only one queen remains.
要么拼死一搏
