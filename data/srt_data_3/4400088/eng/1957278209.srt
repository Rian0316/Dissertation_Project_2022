00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,285
(Max) Ah, it's like I'm
back in my mother's womb.

2
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:12,625
Only, there's food here.

3
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,781
(Caroline) Ugh, those
e-cigs are so stupid.

4
00:00:17,783 --> 00:00:20,350
I mean, smoking real cigarettes kills you,

5
00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:22,859
but smoking fake ones
makes me want to kill you.

6
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:27,224
They're not smoking. They're vaping.

7
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:28,926
(Max) Uh-oh. He just passed it to her.

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,671
Someone's getting date vaped.

9
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,632
I just figured out the new phones.

10
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,429
Now I've got to figure out how to smoke?

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,304
If I wanted to learn
everything all over again,

12
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,601
I would have had a stroke.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,211
(Max) Hey guys, sorry, but you're
not allowed to do that in here.

14
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:50,847
And I'm not talking about your outfits.

15
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,483
I'll get to those when I bring the check.

16
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:55,318
Relax, it's not a cigarette.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,486
It has a battery.

18
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,578
Yeah, so does my vibrator, but...

19
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:03,560
can't use that in here either.

20
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:04,661

21
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:08,231

too many of our cupcake tees.

There are more unworn shirts here

27
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:34,207
than in Matthew MacConaughey's closet.

28

Hey, girls.

29
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:39,245
Look at me.

30
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:44,350
I got my Sunday bra on
'cause I just came from church.

31
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:46,686
Was it my church?

32
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,489
The Church of Latter-Day Sluts?

33
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:52,725
Oleg and I are looking
for one to get married in.

34
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,794
And it's got to have a wheelchair ramp

35
00:01:54,796 --> 00:02:00,166
'cause I've got a lot of cousins
who were born without leg bones.

36
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:02,435
I'm so excited for you, Sophie.

37
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:05,471
You deserve all the happiness
in the world.

38
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:08,708
I mean, so do I, but that's
obviously not happening.

39
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,311
Are you done with your pity-party?

40
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:14,080
'Cause I got to speak to Max.

41
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:18,351
Max, do you want to be my maid of honor?

42
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:23,990
I would rather be eaten alive by a rabbit.

43
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:29,261
Which would take a long time
and be a lot less embarrassing.

44
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:30,463
And Sophie, you don't really want me

45
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:31,597
to be your maid of honor.

46
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,101
That's right. I don't.

47
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:37,870
So why are we even talking about it?

48
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:40,940
Sophie, as honored as I am that you asked,

49
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:44,476
it's just not really my thing,
you know, man?

50
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,846
Is this really not your thing?

51
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:48,847
It's nobody's thing.

52
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,482
You just do it 'cause you're supposed to,

53
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:55,187
like bleaching your teeth or your anus.

54
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:02,027
Thank God I'm off the list,

55
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:06,398
'cause that bridesmaid spa day
is gonna be rough.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,301
Look, I'm sorry, it's just,
I was a maid of honor

57
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:13,172
in fifth grade when my mom
married her cult leader.

58
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:14,506
And then she was my maid of honor

59
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:17,376
when I married him a week later.

60
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:20,178
So I'm kind of maid-of-honored out.

61
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,748
Maybe I'll get one of my old
sorority sisters

62
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,516
to be my bridesmaid.

63
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:27,085
I'm gonna go home and find out

64
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:32,591
which one is still thin enough
to fly commercial.

65
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:35,227
All right, where are we gonna
store all these shirts?

66
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:36,695
It's already too crowded in here

67
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:39,998
with all the cupcakes, shame, and failure.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
We'll sell some of these
at the cupcake window,

69
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:43,668
20 of these are already going

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,370
to that fancy boutique in Manhattan,

71
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:47,472
and the rest, maybe we'll get lucky

72
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:50,942
and find a gay little league team.

73
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:52,410
Oh, I know!

74
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,613
Let's get drunk.

75
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,581
That's your solution to everything.

76
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,049
Seriously.

77
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:02,354
We need to just take some to that new bar
where idiots pay $20 for a drink.

78
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:06,357
Drunk and stupid,
that's our target audience.

79
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,228
And also, the special skills
I've listed on my resume.

80
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,731
So you're saying we're gonna stoop so low

81
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:17,368
as to sell T-shirts
out of a duffle bag in a bar?

82
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,003
Yeah, we're there.

83
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:28,012
How much do you think this pays?

84
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,280
'Cause I can do that.

85
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,481
Yes, you can.

86
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:33,851
All you need is a stepladder and boobs.

87
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:36,087
Feel like the<i> Star Trek:</i>
<i>Next Generation</i> bar.

88
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:39,690
Keep your eyes peeled for
Whoopi Goldberg in a crazy hat.

89
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:42,160
I can't believe I'm selling
T-shirts out of a duffle bag

90
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:43,661
in the future, too.

91
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,931
Yeah. I fully support mixing
business and pleasure.

92
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:51,002
Best sex I ever had was
with my boss at a Panera Bread.

93
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,904
I thought you said
the best sex you ever had

94
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,273
was with a dude with six fingers.

95
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:56,841
Same guy.

96
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,171
Man, could he make a sandwich crazy fast.

97
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:03,080
Hi. Want to buy a cool tee
for your girlfriend?

98
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,149
Let me see if my girlfriend wants a tee.

99
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,619
You want a tee, honey?

100
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,654
(Max) Hey! Hey!

101
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:10,721
Not so fast.

102
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:12,490
They say “cream filled” on the back.

103
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:15,926
Huh, boys? Anything?

104
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:20,364
Wow, gays aren't fun in the future.

105
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,299
Hey.

106
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,304
Jesus comes back in the future.

107
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:27,137
So what's in the bag?

108
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,574
I've never met a girl at a bar
with actual baggage.

109
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:35,646
That's funny because you mean
like emotional.

110
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:37,114
You're really beautiful.

111
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:41,719
Mmm. You weren't nearly
this hot in the book.

112
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:43,253
So can I get you ladies a drink?

113
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:47,257
Sure, you could jut change
this water into wine.

114
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,703
Can you, like, do this for me,
just, like, once?

115
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:53,197
Drinks on me.

116
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,929
Oh, lucky them.

117
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,902
I haven't heard I'm beautiful
from a non-homeless person

118
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:00,804
in months.

119
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:03,840
Well, with that hair,
the jury's still out.

120
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:06,176
Hey, can I kiss you?

121
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:08,512
I suppose a peck wouldn't...

122
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:15,118
Say what?

123
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:19,456
- I'm James.
- I'm wet.

124
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:24,561
Because my arm was sitting
in water on the bar.

125
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:25,996
That was so hot, Max.

126
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:28,698
I have, like, this animal
attraction to him.

127
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,868
What animal? The Horny Nerd?

128
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,170
Look, I'll leave.
You stay and do your thing.

129
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:36,339
- But we came together.
- Yeah, I know you guys did.

130
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:39,209
It happened, like,
the second he kissed you.

131
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:41,111
I don't do this. I just met him.

132
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:42,245
Look, Caroline.

133
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:43,413
I haven't read the Bible.

134
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:45,882
But I know that when Jesus returns,

135
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:49,386
you must follow him back to his apartment.

136
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:50,920
Let go...

137
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:52,422
let God...

138
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:53,590
get to third base.

139
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:05,965
Max, where's Caroline?

140
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,400
I haven't seen her all day.

141
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:09,002
But I'm guessing she's in heaven.

142
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:10,336
[footsteps approaching]

143
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:11,471
I'm here, I'm here.

144
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,507
Nope, she's in hell.

145
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,711
Walk of shame, party of one.

146
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:20,213
Girl.

147
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:23,616
Gir-irl!

148
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:25,351
Tell me everything that happened.

149
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:26,753
Leave out no details.

150
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:29,455
It was insane. I mean, like, so hot.

151
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:31,958
Like the Caribbean
or our shower that one time.

152
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,994
[screaming]

153
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,896
What are you two celebrating?

154
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,999
I know it isn't a job well done.

155
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,469
We are celebrating the release

156
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,938
of the new<i> Star Wars:</i>
<i>Episode VII</i> trailer online.

157
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,040
Seriously? [giddy laughter]

158
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:55,114
Max, we did everything.

159
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:56,282
We...

160
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:57,850
Oleg, can you give us some privacy?

161
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,051
What?

162
00:07:59,053 --> 00:08:00,186
I can't be in the ladies' room.

163
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,821
I can't be in the kitchen.

164
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:09,362
So did you...

165
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,730
No.

166
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:13,332
Well, did you...

167
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,801
No!

168
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:17,903
Well, did you at least...

169
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:20,840
Oh, God, no!

170
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:21,841
Well, what did you do?

171
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:25,644
Water a plant together?

172
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:28,180
We had sex.

173
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:29,682
Last night and today.

174
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:31,383
That's a big thing for me.

175
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:35,054
And, yes, it was.

176
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,123
Yes. That was obvious in the bar.

177
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,527
Skinny jeans are just boner X-rays.

178
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:44,897
Oh, no. Oh, no.

179
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,700
What, rat in the slaw again?

180
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:48,700
My rings.

181
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,502
I left them at his place.

182
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:51,503
I have to get them back.

183
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,105
They're half my belongings.

184
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:56,542
So just text him and say,
“Yo, I left my rings,

185
00:08:56,544 --> 00:09:00,712
nice wiener”" “100” emoji, send.

186
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:03,215
Max, I can't text a guy first.

187
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:07,286
It's bad enough I have a Groupon
for intimacy oil.

188
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:11,890
Look, worst-case scenario,
the McRib is gone for good.

189
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:16,361
Second worst-case scenario,
we can always implement

190
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:17,462
the two-week rule.

191
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:18,997
The two-week rule?

192
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,732
Wait, isn't that how long
you have to eat Pad Thai

193
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,701
before it becomes bad Thai?

194
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,003
No, you really have to read my book.

195
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:27,305
It means if he doesn't text for two weeks,

196
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:32,010
you can break in and get your stuff.

197
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:35,080
All that fancy school
and you didn't learn nothing.

198
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:42,587
Two weeks and nothing.

199
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:44,789
I really thought he'd text.

200
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:49,361
I also thought<i> Grown Ups 2</i>
should have won the Oscar.

201
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,596
Still got it.

202
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:52,664
Come on.

203

[grunts]

204
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:57,068
Wait, before I lose
the rest of my self-esteem...

205
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,872
Tell that to the wall
you're currently straddling.

206
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:03,274
Let me just check my phone
one more time to see if he...

207
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:04,542
Nope.

208
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:09,047
Self-esteem gone.

209
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,615
I'm afraid to jump.

210
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:11,916
Jump, whore, jump!

211
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:16,454
I sound like my mom
teaching me how to swim.

212
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:18,089
[grunting]

213
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,991
I did it. I did it.

214
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:21,092
That was, like, two feet.

215
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:23,594
I've snorted lines longer.

216
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:25,830
All right.

217
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,498
Just another Tuesday.

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,169
Going all<i> Bling Ring</i> in Jesus' backyard.

219
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,070
There. That's his bedroom window.

220
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:36,507
I know 'cause we had to close
it, since I'm kind of loud.

221
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,809
Oh, what are you like during sex?

222
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:42,213
What do I do if he's home?

223
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,581
Do you want me to kill him fast,

224
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,082
or do you want him to suffer?

225
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:46,917
And by that, I mean,
do you want me to hold him

226
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,620
while you ask him why he didn't call?

227
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:51,222
He's not home.

228
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:53,124
According to this Instagram,
he's at Chipotle

229
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:55,893
talking to a guy with a parrot
on his shoulder.

230
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:58,295
He had no time to pop off a text to me.

231
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:04,802
Oh, it's stuck and I can't fit
my boobs through there.

232
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:07,238
I can barely fit them
through the Holland Tunnel.

233
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,106
Fine. I'm going in.

234
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:12,009
Finally, having no boobs pays off.

235
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:13,043
Lift my legs up.

236
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:14,345
Okay, but your legs in the air

237
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:19,116
kind of got you here to begin with.

238
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:21,385
- Uh-oh.
- What oh?

239
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,121
I don't remember him
having a floral duvet.

240
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:25,289
Or a bedside toilet.

241
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,458

Or a dog. Pull me out! Pull me out!

244
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,129
You've got to read my book.

245
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:34,565
I have a whole chapter on pulling out.

[whimpering]

247
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:38,502
No, no, no, no, no! Oh, stop licking me.

<i>(woman) Buster? Buster?</i>

249
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,805
Someone's coming.

250
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:43,640
Someone's coming or getting licked?

251
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:46,343
Maybe you are in the right apartment.

252
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:47,911
[screaming]

253
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:51,014
Get out of my house! Get out of my house!

254
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:53,250
No, no. This is a big mistake.

255
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:55,519
Ben, call the cops!

256
00:11:55,521 --> 00:12:00,257
We got another crack addict here!

257
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,126
We don't have crack here!

258
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:08,565
We don't have crack here!
And tell your friends!

259
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,867
[police sirens blaring]

260
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:24,280
If these match the prints found
at an Arby's break-in in '07,

261
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:27,550
it's purely coincidental.

262
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:29,085
I can't believe this is happening to me.

263
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:30,754
My life is over.

264
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:32,055
Look at the camera.

265
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,026
I'm so humiliated.

266

And turn to the side.

267
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,135
Ma'am, this isn't “Vogue: Behind Bars.”

268
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:49,339
Sorry, Officer, she's a virgin.

269
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,441
Me, myself, spent some time
in the juvie system

270
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:52,875
up in Providence.

271
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:54,544
You know a family court judge
named Shelly?

272
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:57,013
No. Go.

273
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,116
Oh! Officer, hold.

274
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:08,658
Thanks, but stay away during
the full-body cavity search.

275
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,625
Proceed.

276
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:10,927
You think?

277
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:17,333
So you girls broke into
an old lady's house,

278
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:22,405
got halfway through the window,
and stole absolutely nothing.

279

Glad I am protecting the city from you.

280
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:28,010
I mean, ISIS who, right?

281
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:30,546
All right. Let's go.

282
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:33,482
If he had just texted me,
none of this would be happening.

283
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:35,117
I wouldn't be in prison, I'd be home.

284
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,886
My other prison.

285
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:39,688
Uh, wait, if who had texted you?

286
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,124
Thanks for asking.

287
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,926
This guy I slept with didn't text me

288
00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:46,095
for two weeks after we had sex,
and I left my rings

289
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:47,129
at his place, so I...

290
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:52,001
You did the two-week rule?

291
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,502
Yeah.

292
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:55,604
But she got the wrong apartment
because, knowing her,

293
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,340
her eyes were closed the whole time.

294
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,075
Well, why didn't you say so?

295
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:04,179
We got a two-week rule over here!

296
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,081
Stay right over here.

We'll get you out soon.

What am I gonna tell my father?

won't be ready in an hour.

get-out-of-jail-free card.

to bail you out.

that's not scary at all.

356
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,080
You know, I won my yacht club talent show

357
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:50,083
three years in a row,
in the 10 to 13 division.

358
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:51,518
That's crazy!

359
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,422
I'm looking at 10 to 13
for grand theft auto.

360
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:56,423
Where are my manners?

361
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:57,991
I'm Tanaya.

362
00:16:57,993 --> 00:16:59,459
I'm Max. This is Caroline.

363
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:02,228
But you can call us by our gang names,

364
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,133
White Lightning and The Blade.

365
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:09,903
Sophie, I need you to bail
me and Caroline out jail.

366
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,504
We got charged with breaking and entering,

367
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:13,806
which is also what Caroline
let a guy do to her,

368
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:16,676
and that's why we're here.

369
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:18,978
Oh, jeez, Max.

370
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,681
I mean, that's a tough call.

371
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:26,285
I mean, I don't know if I can.

372
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:31,657
Yeah, it's really not my thing.

373
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:36,229
You know, man?

374
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:38,464
I get it. I deserved that.

375
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:41,534
I said no to you,
so you're saying no to me.

376
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:46,105
Like the old saying, “Tit for bigger tat.”

377
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,940
Yeah. Hmm.

378
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,009
All right, let's see.

379
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:55,014
Uh, I would bail
my maid of honor out of jail.

380
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,515
Fine. Fine.

381
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,017
I'll be your maid of honor.

382
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:00,519
I'll buy you penis straws,
and those glasses

383
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:02,221
where the nose is a penis.

384
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:05,157
Yeah! And the penis-shaped pasta?

385
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,726
I'll do it all.

386
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:11,130
I can handle the slammer, but
Caroline doesn't stand a chance.

387
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,331
I saw a woman looking at her

388
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,901
like she was a cartoon pork chop.

389
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:18,304
Okay. Well, I'll see you soon.

390
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,538
And watch your back.

391
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,140
Oh, you know what?

392
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,810
It's a ladies' prison,
so watch your front.

393
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:33,619
Is this your card?

394
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:34,853
No.

395
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:35,854
Yes!

396
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:36,989
Yes, that's my card.

397
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,725
Amazing.

398
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,927
Okay. What'd I miss?

399
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,596
The magic show and the improv troupe.

400
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:48,100
They asked the audience for a word.
I said, “Help.”

401
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:50,102
Sophie's coming down with bail money,

402
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:51,837
as soon as her turkey is out of the oven.

403
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,474
So 4, 4 1/2 hours,
depending on the stuffing.

404
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:56,942
Thank God.

405
00:18:56,944 --> 00:18:58,844
Wait. Bail for both of us, right?

406
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,345
That wasn't her original offer.

407
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,448
But after some negotiating, we got there.

408
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,016
What did you have to do to...

409
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,485
Max, you didn't agree to...

410
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:07,853
Yup.

411
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,289
Picture me in something low-cut and peach.

412
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,059
A slutty peach.

413
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,460
You'd do that for me?

414
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:17,495
I'm touched and shocked.

415
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:19,264
I thought you'd have forgotten
me, had sex with the door guard,

416
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,133
and been halfway across
the parking lot by now.

417
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:25,704
Yeah, well, he wasn't into me, so...

418
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:35,613
Walk of shame, party of two.

419
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,282
Girls, I heard you got locked up.

420
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:40,185
Yup. We have to do 30 hours
of community service.

421
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:42,320
And Caroline won six minutes
of privacy on the toilet

422
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:43,655
in the talent show.

423
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:45,557
Well, not so private.

424
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,992
I had to tinkle while a woman
in work boots

425
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:50,228
made heavy eye-contact.

426
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,798
I went to prison once
for being at the wrong place

427
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,799
at the wrong time.

428
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:57,602
Meaning, I was down south.

429
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:03,007
Look who's back from the big house.

430
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:05,743
Every house is a big house for you, Han.

431
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:07,578
Watch your step, ex-con,

432
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,984
or I'll get the to haul you back
in for impersonating a waitress.

433
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:16,254
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I missed this place.

434
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,023
When I was up in the pen, doing
time with my girl, Tanaya...

435
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:22,292
Well, orange you the new black?

436
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,648
So, did you two have fun 
in ladies' prison?

437
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:29,500
And tell me, is it anything like the
17 XXX movies I have with that title?

438
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,507
Okay, so I lost two of my best rings.

439
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,398
So I'm out $11.

440
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,781
I realized I'm tougher than I thought.

441
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:40,398
I sang in prison. I had a one-night stand.

442
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,429
I'm practically Johnny Cash.

443
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,328
Well, Johnny No Cash.

444
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:50,976
