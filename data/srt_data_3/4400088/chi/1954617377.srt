1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,290
啊 我好像又回到我妈的子宫里了
Ah, it's like I'm back in my mother's womb.

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,180
只是这里有食物
Only, there's food here.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,010
电子烟这玩意儿真是蠢透了
Ugh, those e-cigs are so stupid.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,270
抽真烟能要你的命
I mean, smoking real cigarettes kills you,

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,220
但是抽假烟让我想要了你的命
but smoking fake ones makes me want to kill you.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,270
他们抽的不是烟 是电子烟
They're not smoking. They're vaping.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,860
呃喔 他还把烟递给了她
Uh-oh. He just passed it to her.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,230
人家都在以电子烟之名约会了
Someone's getting date vaped.

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,620
我才刚搞清楚新手机咋用
I just figured out the new phones.

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,370
现在我还得搞清楚怎么抽烟?
Now I've got to figure out how to smoke?

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,240
要是我想把一切都重新学起
If I wanted to learn everything all over again,

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,510
我早就中风了
I would have had a stroke.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,210
不好意思 各位 你们这种举动是不允许的
Hey guys, sorry, but you're not allowed to do that in here.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,800
我指的不是你们的装扮
And I'm not talking about your outfits.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,420
我等等给你们找钱的时候再吐槽那个
I'll get to those when I bring the check.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,250
放松点 这不是香烟
Relax, it's not a cigarette.

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,470
它有电池的
It has a battery.

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,760
是啊 我的震动棒也有电池 但是...
Yeah, so does my vibrator, but...

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,480
那个在这里也不能用
can't use that in here either.

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,950
但我对那规定也不赞同
I didn't approve that rule.

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,250
我觉得咱们订购了太多的纸杯蛋糕裇衫了
Well, I think we ordered too many of our cupcake tees.

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,340
这儿没穿过的衣服
There are more unworn shirts here

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,240
比马修·麦康纳衣橱里的还多了
than in Matthew MacConaughey's closet.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,710
嘿 姐妹们
Hey, girls.

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,450
你们看看我
Look at me.

28
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,240
我穿上了我的周日胸罩 因为我刚从教堂回来
I got my Sunday bra on 'cause I just came from church.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,770
是我经常去的教堂吗?
Was it my church?

30
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,590
后荡妇时代教堂吗?
The Church of Latter-Day Sluts?

31
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,910
Oleg和我在找一个地方作为结婚礼堂
Oleg and I are looking for one to get married in.

32
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,960
而且那个地方一定要有轮椅坡道
And it's got to have a wheelchair ramp

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,280
因为我很多堂表亲一出来就没腿骨的
'cause I've got a lot of cousins who were born without leg bones.

34
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,620
我真为你感到高兴 Sophie
I'm so excited for you, Sophie.

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,620
你理应是全天下最幸福的女人
You deserve all the happiness in the world.

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,880
我也应当如此 但显然我没这种福分了
I mean, so do I, but that's obviously not happening.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,460
你自怜自艾结束了吗?
Are you done with your pity-party?

38
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,250
我要和Max说几句话
'Cause I got to speak to Max.

39
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,470
Max啊 你愿意做我的首席伴娘吗?
Max, do you want to be my maid of honor?

40
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,090
我宁愿被一只兔子活吞了
I would rather be eaten alive by a rabbit.

41
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,410
因为这也要好长时间 但不会让我尴尬
Which would take a long time and be a lot less embarrassing.

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,600
Sophie啊 你不是真心想让我
And Sophie, you don't really want me

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,770
做你的首席伴娘的
to be your maid of honor.

44
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,270
是啊 我不想
That's right. I don't.

45
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,990
那我们还在讲这件事干什么?
So why are we even talking about it?

46
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,080
Sophie 我很荣幸能受到你的邀请
Sophie, as honored as I am that you asked,

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,610
但这事儿真的不适合我啊 你懂吗?
it's just not really my thing, you know, man?

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,950
这事儿真的不适合你?
Is this really not your thing?

49
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,080
这事儿就没有谁适合啊
It's nobody's thing.

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,670
因为要你做 你就去做啊
You just do it 'cause you're supposed to,

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,170
就像刷牙和洗屁眼一样
like bleaching your teeth or your anus.

52
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,260
幸好你没考虑我
Thank God I'm off the list,

53
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,520
因为伴娘水疗日那天一定会难熬极了
'cause that bridesmaid spa day is gonna be rough.

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,440
对不起 我当过首席伴娘
Look, I'm sorry, it's just, I was a maid of honor

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,270
当时是五年级 我妈妈嫁给了一个邪教教主
in fifth grade when my mom married her cult leader.

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,610
一个礼拜之后我和他结婚
And then she was my maid of honor

57
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,480
我妈又是我的首席伴娘
when I married him a week later.

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,350
所以我有点不太想当首席伴娘了
So I'm kind of maid-of-honored out.

59
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,880
也许我去找个姐妹会里的旧识
Maybe I'll get one of my old sorority sisters

60
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,640
来当我的伴娘吧
to be my bridesmaid.

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,270
我要回家去看看
I'm gonna go home and find out

62
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,710
谁还能瘦得可以坐进商务飞机
which one is still thin enough to fly commercial.

63
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,330
好吧 我们要把这些衣服放在哪里?
All right, where are we gonna store all these shirts?

64
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,830
这里空间已经不够了
It's already too crowded in here

65
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,130
挤满了纸杯蛋糕 羞辱 和失败
with all the cupcakes, shame, and failure.

66
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,390
在我们自家的纸杯蛋糕窗口可以卖掉一些
We'll sell some of these at the cupcake window,

67
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,840
这里的20件已经被卖给了
20 of these are already going

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,560
曼哈顿的一家高档的精品时装店
to that fancy boutique in Manhattan,

69
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,680
剩下的么 我们也许会走运
and the rest, maybe we'll get lucky

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,060
找到一个同性恋小联盟队
and find a gay little league team.

71
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,510
哦 我知道了!
Oh, I know!

72
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,820
我们去喝醉吧
Let's get drunk.

73
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,680
你什么事情都是这个解决方案
That's your solution to everything.

74
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,190
我说真的
Seriously.

75
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,490
我们得拿一些去那个新开的酒吧
We need to just take some to that new bar

76
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,490
那里的白痴花20美元买一杯酒
where idiots pay $20 for a drink.

77
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,490
一群愚蠢的醉汉 那就是我们的目标人群
Drunk and stupid, that's our target audience.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,360
这特殊技能我在自己的简历里也有写到
And also, the special skills I've listed on my resume.

79
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,920
所以你是说我们已经卑微到这种程度了
So you're saying we're gonna stoop so low

80
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,500
要拿着行李袋去一个酒吧里卖衣服?
as to sell T-shirts out of a duffle bag in a bar?

81
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,010
是的 我们已经堕落了
Yeah, we're there.

82
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,180
你觉得这工作有多少工资?
How much do you think this pays?

83
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,380
我干得了这活啊
'Cause I can do that.

84
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,600
是啊 你干的了
Yes, you can.

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,050
你只有一个梯子和一对大胸就行
All you need is a stepladder and boobs.

86
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,220
这地方感觉像是星际迷航:下一代主题酒吧
Feel like the Star Trek: Next Generation bar.

87
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,860
把眼皮给剥了 扮成乌比·戈德堡 再戴个疯帽子
Keep your eyes peeled for Whoopi Goldberg in a crazy hat.

88
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,280
我也无法相信我拿着一个行李袋
I can't believe I'm selling T-shirts out of a duffle bag

89
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,800
在未来卖衣服
in the future, too.

90
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,070
是啊 我完全支持把公事和享乐混在一起
Yeah. I fully support mixing business and pleasure.

91
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,210
我最棒的一次性体验是和老板在帕纳拉面包那次
Best sex I ever had was with my boss at a Panera Bread.

92
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,070
我记得你说过最棒的一次
I thought you said the best sex you ever had

93
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,360
是和一个六个手指的哥们
was with a dude with six fingers.

94
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,980
是同一个人啦
Same guy.

95
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,960
天啊 他做三明治像是疯了一样快
Man, could he make a sandwich crazy fast.

96
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,250
嗨 你想为你的女朋友买一件很酷的T恤吗?
Hi. Want to buy a cool tee for your girlfriend?

97
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,250
我问问我女朋友想不想要T恤
Let me see if my girlfriend wants a tee.

98
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,760
你想要T恤吗 亲爱的?
You want a tee, honey?

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,740
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

100
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,910
别走那么快啊
Not so fast.

101
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,630
它后面可写着"装满了奶油"呢
They say "cream filled" on the back.

102
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,130
呃 兄弟们? 有感觉吗?
Huh, boys? Anything?

103
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,470
哇 未来的同性恋可一点都不好玩
Wow, gays aren't fun in the future.

104
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,440
嘿
Hey.

105
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,740
耶稣从未来归来
Jesus comes back in the future.

106
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,270
这包里有什么?
So what's in the bag?

107
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,760
我从来没在酒吧见过一个带着行李袋的女孩
I've never met a girl at a bar with actual baggage.

108
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,750
真有趣 因为你是想说我情绪丰富
That's funny because you mean like emotional.

109
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,280
你真的很漂亮
You're really beautiful.

110
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,840
嗯 你在圣经里可没那么帅
Mmm. You weren't nearly this hot in the book.

111
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,460
可否让我请你们喝酒?
So can I get you ladies a drink?

112
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,460
当然可以 你可以直接把这杯水变成酒
Sure, you could just change this water into wine.

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,300
你能不能为我 就这样 甩一次秀发?
Can you, like, do this for me, just, like, once?

114
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
酒算我的
Drinks on me.

115
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,490
它们艳福不浅啊
Oh, lucky them.

116
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,020
除了流浪汉之外 我已好久没听过别人
I haven't heard I'm beautiful from a non-homeless person

117
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,940
夸我漂亮了
in months.

118
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,940
从他的发型来看 也难确定身份啊
Well, with that hair, the jury's still out.

119
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,310
嘿 我能吻你吗?
Hey, can I kiss you?

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,480
我想轻吻一下无妨...
I suppose a peck wouldn't...

121
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,120
神马情况?
Say what?

122
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,660
- 我叫James  - 我湿了
- I'm James.  - I'm wet.

123
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,670
因为我胳膊蹭到吧台上的水了
Because my arm was sitting in water on the bar.

124
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,200
太热辣了 Max
That was so hot, Max.

125
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,840
他对我有种野兽般的狂野吸引力
I have, like, this animal attraction to him.

126
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,010
什么野兽? 饥渴的书呆子?
What animal? The Horny Nerd?

127
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,340
听着 我要走了 你留下来浪吧
Look, I'll leave. You stay and do your thing.

128
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,480
- 但我们是一起来嗨的啊 - 是啊 你们俩挺嗨
- But we came together.  - Yeah, I know you guys did.

129
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,350
他一亲你的时候你就嗨了
It happened, like, the second he kissed you.

130
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,180
这不是我风格 我才刚认识他
I don't do this. I just met him.

131
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,330
听着 Caroline
Look, Caroline.

132
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,520
我没有读过圣经
I haven't read the Bible.

133
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,020
但是我知道当耶稣归来之时
But I know that when Jesus returns,

134
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,470
你必须跟着他回到他的住所
you must follow him back to his apartment.

135
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,010
别拘束...
Let go...

136
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,510
让主耶稣...
let God...

137
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,580
带你走完全程
get to third base.

138
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,090
Max Caroline呢?
Max, where's Caroline?

139
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,540
我一整天没见到她了
I haven't seen her all day.

140
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,090
但我猜她在天堂呢
But I'm guessing she's in heaven.

141
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,560
我来了 我来了
I'm here, I'm here.

142
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,710
不是 她在地狱了
Nope, she's in hell.

143
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,850
彻夜不归 派对荡妹
Walk of shame, party of one.

144
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,270
妞
Girl.

145
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,720
小妞儿!
Gir-irl!

146
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,440
把所有情况都告诉我
Tell me everything that happened.

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,940
事无巨细
Leave out no details.

148
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,610
太疯狂了 太火热了
It was insane. I mean, like, so hot.

149
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,060
热得像加勒比海 或像我们上次洗澡那样
Like the Caribbean or our shower that one time.

150
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,040
你们欢呼什么呢?
What are you two celebrating?

151
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,990
我知道肯定不是工作出色
I know it isn't a job well done.

152
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,710
我们在庆祝新的星球大战:第七部
We are celebrating the release

153
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,080
预告片在网上上映了
of the new Star Wars: Episode VII trailer online.

154
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,050
真的吗?
Seriously?

155
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,220
Max 我们什么都做了
Max, we did everything.

156
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,410
我们...
We...

157
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,970
Oleg 能给我们点隐私吗?
Oleg, can you give us some privacy?

158
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,140
怎么?
What?

159
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,310
我不能出现在女厕
I can't be in the ladies' room.

160
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,810
也不能在厨房呆着了
I can't be in the kitchen.

161
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,440
所以你们...
So did you...

162
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,820
没有
No.

163
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,440
好吧 那你们...
Well, did you...

164
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,940
没有!
No!

165
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,990
那你们起码...
Well, did you at least...

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,950
天 当然没有!
Oh, God, no!

167
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,950
那你们到底干嘛了?
Well, what did you do?

168
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,750
一起浇花?
Water a plant together?

169
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,290
我们做爱了
We had sex.

170
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,790
昨晚和今天
Last night and today.

171
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,460
这对我来说是件大事
That's a big thing for me.

172
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,260
没错 确实大事
And, yes, it was.

173
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,300
嗯 在酒吧时就很明显
Yes. That was obvious in the bar.

174
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,520
紧身牛仔裤让下体一览无余
Skinny jeans are just boner X-rays.

175
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,970
哦 不 哦 不
Oh, no. Oh, no.

176
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,810
怎么 沙拉里又有老鼠了?
What, rat in the slaw again?

177
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,810
我的戒指
My rings.

178
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,610
我落在他家了
I left them at his place.

179
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,610
我得拿回来
I have to get them back.

180
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,310
它们是我的半副身家了
They're half my belongings.

181
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,820
那就发个短信说 "嘿 我戒指忘拿了
So just text him and say, "Yo, I left my rings,

182
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,820
小弟弟不错" 选个满分的表情 发送 
nice wiener" "100" emoji, send.

183
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,320
Max 我不能先给男方发短信
Max, I can't text a guy first.

184
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,490
买润滑油都要团购已经够糟糕了
It's bad enough I have a Groupon for intimacy oil.

185
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,880
最坏的情况 也就是你再也吃不到带"骨"大牛排了
Look, worst-case scenario, the McRib is gone for good.

186
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
第二坏的情况就是我们总可以采取
Second worst-case scenario, we can always implement

187
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,550
两周法则嘛
the two-week rule.

188
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,140
两周法则?
The two-week rule?

189
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,840
慢着 就是两周内要吃完泰式炒面
Wait, isn't that how long you have to eat Pad Thai

190
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
否则会变质吗?
before it becomes bad Thai?

191
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,180
不是 你真的该读读我的书
No, you really have to read my book.

192
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,480
指的是如果他两周内不发短信
It means if he doesn't text for two weeks,

193
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,180
你就可以闯进他家取回你的东西
you can break in and get your stuff.

194
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,070
白读那么多好学校 你啥也没学到
All that fancy school and you didn't learn nothing.

195
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,700
两周了屁都没有
Two weeks and nothing.

196
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,030
我真以为他会发短信的
I really thought he'd text.

197
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,500
我还以为"长大成人2"会得奥斯卡奖
I also thought Grown Ups 2 should have won the Oscar.

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,700
仍然屡猜不中
Still got it.

199
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,760
麻利点
Come on.

200
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,210
等下 在我把剩下的自尊也丢完之前...
Wait, before I lose the rest of my self-esteem...

201
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,010
跟你骑着的那面墙说去
Tell that to the wall you're currently straddling.

202
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,380
让我再查下手机看看他有没有...
Let me just check my phone one more time to see if he...

203
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,680
没有
Nope.

204
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,190
自尊心彻底没了
Self-esteem gone.

205
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,720
我不敢跳
I'm afraid to jump.

206
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,060
跳啊 小贱人 给我跳!
Jump, whore, jump!

207
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,560
听起来像我妈教我游泳似的
I sound like my mom teaching me how to swim.

208
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,070
我做到了 我做到了
I did it. I did it.

209
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,200
墙才两英尺高
That was, like, two feet.

210
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,700
我擤的鼻涕都比这长
I've snorted lines longer.

211
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,910
哎呀呀
All right.

212
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,740
又是普通的一天
Just another Tuesday.

213
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,380
悄悄来到耶稣的后院偷戒指
Going all Bling Ring in Jesus' backyard.

214
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,300
这里 那是他卧室的窗户
There. That's his bedroom window.

215
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,630
我很了解 因为我叫得太大声我们得关窗
I know 'cause we had to close it, since I'm kind of loud.

216
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,800
你在滚床单时都是啥样啊?
Oh, what are you like during sex?

217
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,420
他要是在家怎么办?
What do I do if he's home?

218
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,720
你是想我手起刀落砍了他
Do you want me to kill him fast,

219
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,260
还是慢慢折磨他?
or do you want him to suffer?

220
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,090
折磨的意思是 你想让我抓着他
And by that, I mean, do you want me to hold him

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,760
然后你来问他为什么不打电话吗?
while you ask him why he didn't call?

222
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,400
他不在家
He's not home.

223
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,270
看他的更新的状态 他在墨西哥餐厅
According to this Instagram, he's at Chipotle

224
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,100
和一个肩膀上有只鹦鹉的人在聊天
talking to a guy with a parrot on his shoulder.

225
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,270
他忙得没时间发短信给我
He had no time to pop off a text to me.

226
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,990
噢 我要被窗户卡住了 胸都过不去
Oh, it's stuck and I can't fit my boobs through there.

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,360
要知道荷兰隧道才刚刚够我的胸挤进去
I can barely fit them through the Holland Tunnel.

228
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,250
好吧 我进去
Fine. I'm going in.

229
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,120
终于 飞机场还是有点用处的
Finally, having no boobs pays off.

230
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
把我的腿抬起来
Lift my legs up.

231
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,450
好吧 你一开始来这地方的
Okay, but your legs in the air

232
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,290
契机也是为了要张开双腿
kind of got you here to begin with.

233
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,590
- 呃噢  - 噢什么?
- Uh-oh.  - What oh?

234
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,250
我不记得他的羽绒被有花
I don't remember him having a floral duvet.

235
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,430
旁边还有一个厕所
Or a bedside toilet.

236
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,970
还有一只狗 快把我弄出来!
Or a dog. Pull me out! Pull me out!

237
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,300
你真得好好读读我的书
You've got to read my book.

238
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,690
我有一整章写的都是如何弄出来
I have a whole chapter on pulling out.

239
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,780
不 不 不! 噢 别舔我了
No, no, no, no, no! Oh, stop licking me.

240
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,650
Buster? 怎么了
Buster? Buster?

241
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,980
有人来了
Someone's coming.

242
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,820
有人来了 还被舔了?
Someone's coming or getting licked?

243
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,490
或许这正是你要找的地方啊
Maybe you are in the right apartment.

244
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,160
从我的房间里滚出去! 滚出去!
Get out of my house! Get out of my house!

245
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,330
不 不 你误会了
No, no. This is a big mistake.

246
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,710
Ben 叫警察!
Ben, call the cops!

247
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,380
这儿有个吸毒者!
We got another crack addict here!

248
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,340
我们这里没有毒品!
We don't have crack here!

249
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,670
我们没有毒品! 告诉你的朋友!
We don't have crack here! And tell your friends!

250
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,410
如果这些指纹和07年闯入阿贝餐厅嫌疑犯的指纹相吻合
If these match the prints found at an Arby's break-in in '07,

251
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,690
那纯粹是巧合
it's purely coincidental.

252
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,200
真不敢相信我会发生这种事
I can't believe this is happening to me.

253
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,860
我完蛋了
My life is over.

254
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,030
看镜头
Look at the camera.

255
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,170
我真是没脸见人了
I'm so humiliated.

256
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,040
转过身
And turn to the side.

257
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,260
女士 这不是在拍"时尚:监狱诱惑" 
Ma'am, this isn't "Vogue: Behind Bars."

258
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,550
对不起 警官 她还是个处女
Sorry, Officer, she's a virgin.

259
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,550
我曾在普罗维登斯的青少年教养院
Me, myself, spent some time in the juvie system

260
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,050
呆过一段时间
up in Providence.

261
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,720
你认识一个叫做雪莉的家庭法院法官吗?
You know a family court judge named Shelly?

262
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,020
没有 过去
No. Go.

263
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,110
噢! 警官 等一下
Oh! Officer, hold.

264
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,730
谢谢 但是全身检查的时候离我远一点
Thanks, but stay away during the full-body cavity search.

265
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
开始吧
Proceed.

266
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,900
要你命令我?
You think?

267
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,540
所以你们两个闯进老婆婆的家里
So you girls broke into an old lady's house,

268
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,580
爬进窗户 却什么都没偷
got halfway through the window, and stole absolutely nothing.

269
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
真高兴是我来保护这座城市啊
Glad I am protecting the city from you.

270
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,220
ISIS组织算得了啥
I mean, ISIS who, right?

271
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,720
好了 我们走吧
All right. Let's go.

272
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,640
如果他给我发短信 就不会发生这些事
If he had just texted me, none of this would be happening.

273
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,230
我就不会进监狱 而是呆在家
I wouldn't be in prison, I'd be home.

274
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,100
我的另一个监狱
My other prison.

275
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,820
噢 等下 如果谁给你发短信?
Uh, wait, if who had texted you?

276
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,320
谢谢你的关心
Thanks for asking.

277
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,100
这个家伙把我睡了之后 
This guy I slept with didn't text me

278
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,240
就两个星期都没给我发短信 我还把戒指
for two weeks after we had sex, and I left my rings

279
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,270
落在他家 所以我...
at his place, so I...

280
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,110
你这是遵循两周法则?
You did the two-week rule?

281
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,610
是的
Yeah.

282
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,750
但是她找错了地方 你懂的
But she got the wrong apartment because, knowing her,

283
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,450
她在嘿咻的时候全程是闭眼的
her eyes were closed the whole time.

284
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,290
哎 你怎么不早说呢?
Well, why didn't you say so?

285
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,290
这里有一个两周法则的傻瓜!
We got a two-week rule over here!

286
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,180
呆在这里别动
Stay right over here.

287
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,840
一会我们就能放你们走
We'll get you out soon.

288
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,300
我把我的警棍丢在了警长家里
I left my billy club at the Captain's house.

289
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,430
他还有三天时间
He's got three more days.

290
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,520
看见了吗? 看见了吗?
See? See?

291
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,800
没事的
It's gonna be fine.

292
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,350
我们只需要悠闲地等一个小时
We'll just chill here for an hour.

293
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,690
这里就是警局版的亮视点眼镜店
It's like an edgier Lens Crafters.

294
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,030
我该怎么跟我爸爸说呢?
What am I gonna tell my father?

295
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,310
从监狱打电话给监狱?
A prisoned prison call?

296
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,480
我不能呆在这
I can't be here.

297
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,150
我不能呆在这!
I can't be here!

298
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,650
不! 不! 快回来! 我们没事的!
No! No! Come back! We were good!

299
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,490
愚蠢的行动
Dumb move.

300
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,490
比我和队长还愚蠢
Dumber than me and the Captain.

301
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,460
我看 我们的眼镜一个小时是配不好了
Let me guess, our glasses won't be ready in an hour.

302
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,350
简直难以置信 你把我们关到了监狱里
I can't believe you got us arrested in jail.

303
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,350
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

304
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,190
生活已经无处可去
I mean, besides nowhere in life.

305
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,610
这会儿已不能让你们俩免费出狱了
You girls lost your get-out-of-jail-free card.

306
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,690
得有人保释你们才行
You're gonna have to get someone to bail you out.

307
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,860
你们去拘留室待着吧
You're going in the holding cell.

308
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,320
嘿! 小鲜肉来了!
Yo! Fresh meat!

309
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,900
抱歉 我也得维护自己的威望
Sorry, I have a reputation to uphold.

310
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,540
Max 我太害怕了
Max, I'm scared.

311
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,210
交给我
I got this.

312
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,960
嘿! 这婊子已经是我的了!
Yo! She's already my bitch!

313
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,050
谁也别想动她 不好意思了
So she can't be anyone else's. Sorry.

314
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,340
抓着我的皮带
Hold my belt.

315
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,340
- 什么?  - 照我说的做!
- What?  - Do it!

316
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,560
有事吗 有事吗? 
'Sup, 'sup?

317
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,150
酷 酷 
Cool, cool.

318
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,680
五十个人 一个厕所?
50 women, 1 toilet?

319
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,020
这就像是"视野乐团"的后台啊
It's like backstage at The View.

320
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,190
Max 我受不了了
Max, I can't handle this.

321
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,570
我受不了了
I can't handle this.

322
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,190
我甚至都不忍心看绿里奇迹了
I couldn't even watch The Green Mile.

323
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,530
放轻松 我们只不过是在玩监狱游戏
Relax. This is play-jail.

324
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,000
这可不像是我们平常的游戏
It's not like we're doing real time.

325
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,660
把你玩游戏时的表情摆出来就行了
Just put on your game face.

326
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,030
我哪有玩游戏时的表情
I don't have a game face.

327
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,590
除非是 "我不干了 我的生活完蛋了" 这种游戏
Unless the game is "I Give Up, My Life Is Over,"

328
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,670
我现在就是那种表情
then this will do.

329
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,930
那么 做点什么 不然那个正向我们走来
Well, do something, because that's about to get wiped off

330
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,840
满身纹身的壮女人
your face by the bruiser covered in tattoos

331
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,550
就要撕开你的脸了
making her way to us right now.

332
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,050
嘿!
Hey!

333
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,770
你们是报名参加才艺秀的吗?
You guys signing up for the talent show?

334
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,440
再说一遍?
Excuse me?

335
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,390
我们中有些人已经在这儿好几天了
Yeah. Some of us have been in here for days,

336
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,720
都怪监狱的人太多了
due to prison overcrowding.

337
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,530
所以守卫允许我们搞表演
So the guards let us put on a show.

338
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,730
只要别死人就行
As long as nobody dies.

339
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,200
哇 监狱已经变了
Wow, prison has changed.

340
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,070
我能想象在诺曼•洛克威尔笔下的监狱了
Maybe I have a Norman Rockwell idea of prison,

341
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,120
不过要是在排队打饭时往告密者
but, uh, what happened to shanking a snitch

342
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,620
插上一刀要怎么弄?
in the food line?

343
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,740
哦 才艺秀 这一点也不可怕
Oh, a talent show, that's not scary at all.

344
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,240
告诉你 我在游艇俱乐部才艺比赛
You know, I won my yacht club talent show

345
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,130
10到13岁的小组里 连续赢了三年
three years in a row, in the 10 to 13 division.

346
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,580
这太疯狂了!
That's crazy!

347
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,470
我正看着10至13岁的侠盗车手呢
I'm looking at 10 to 13 for grand theft auto.

348
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,470
我真没礼貌
Where are my manners?

349
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,090
我是Tanaya
I'm Tanaya.

350
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,590
我是Max 这是Caroline
I'm Max. This is Caroline.

351
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,310
但你可以用我们组合的名字叫我们
But you can call us by our gang names,

352
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,260
"白色闪电"和"断刀客"
White Lightning and The Blade.

353
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,070
Sophie 我需要你来保释我和Caroline出狱
Sophie, I need you to bail me and Caroline out jail.

354
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,650
我们因破门入室罪被抓了
We got charged with breaking and entering,

355
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,900
Caroline也让一个家伙入了她的蓬门
which is also what Caroline let a guy do to her,

356
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,770
所以我们才进了这里
and that's why we're here.

357
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,080
天啊 Max
Oh, jeez, Max.

358
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,780
你这来电真让我为难
I mean, that's a tough call.

359
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,250
我不知道自己能不能行啊
I mean, I don't know if I can.

360
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,760
但这事儿我真的干不来啊
Yeah, it's really not my thing.

361
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,340
你懂的 哥们儿?
You know, man?

362
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,630
我明白 是我活该
I get it. I deserved that.

363
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,770
我拒绝了你 所以你也拒绝我
I said no to you, so you're saying no to me.

364
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,270
正如俗话说的"以胸还大胸"
Like the old saying, "Tit for bigger tat."

365
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,020
是啊 嗯
Yeah. Hmm.

366
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,120
好吧 这样吧
All right, let's see.

367
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,110
我会保释我的伴娘出狱
Uh, I would bail my maid of honor out of jail.

368
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,610
好 好
Fine. Fine.

369
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,150
我会当你的伴娘
I'll be your maid of honor.

370
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,620
我会给你买鸡鸡形的吸管 还有
I'll buy you penis straws, and those glasses

371
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,370
鼻子上是个鸡鸡的眼镜
where the nose is a penis.

372
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,210
好! 还要鸡鸡形的意大利面?
Yeah! And the penis-shaped pasta?

373
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,820
我全都照办
I'll do it all.

374
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,210
我不怕坐牢 但是Caroline完全接受不了
I can handle the slammer, but Caroline doesn't stand a chance.

375
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,500
我看见一个女的在盯着她
I saw a woman looking at her

376
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,000
就像她是个卡通猪排一样
like she was a cartoon pork chop.

377
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,380
好了 我们一会儿见
Okay. Well, I'll see you soon.

378
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,640
小心背后
And watch your back.

379
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,300
噢 不对哦
Oh, you know what?

380
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,760
这是女子监狱 所以小心你的前面
It's a ladies' prison, so watch your front.

381
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,720
这是你那张牌吗?
Is this your card?

382
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,900
不是
No.

383
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
是!
Yes!

384
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,020
是 这就是我那张牌
Yes, that's my card.

385
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,860
太棒了
Amazing.

386
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,030
好了 我错过什么了?
Okay. What'd I miss?

387
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,690
魔术表演和即兴戏剧
The magic show and the improv troupe.

388
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
他们让观众点评一下
They asked the audience for a word.

389
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,200
我说的是 "救命啊"
I said, "Help."

390
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
等Sophie的火鸡出炉了
Sophie's coming down with bail money,

391
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,000
她就会带着保释金过来
as soon as her turkey is out of the oven.

392
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,540
四小时 或四个半小时 取决于馅料的多少
So 4, 4 1/2 hours, depending on the stuffing.

393
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,040
谢天谢地
Thank God.

394
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,930
等等 保释我们两个人 对吗?
Wait. Bail for both of us, right?

395
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,510
她最开始不是这么说的
That wasn't her original offer.

396
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,510
但经过一番协商后 我们成功拿下了
But after some negotiating, we got there.

397
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,050
你答应她的条件是...
What did you have to do to...

398
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,550
Max 你不会是答应...
Max, you didn't agree to...

399
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,020
对
Yup.

400
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,390
想象下我穿着低胸露点装的样子
Picture me in something low-cut and peach.

401
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,110
淫荡的样子
A slutty peach.

402
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,530
你为了我这样做的吗?
You'd do that for me?

403
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,560
我既感动又惊讶
I'm touched and shocked.

404
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,360
我还以为你已经把我忘了 跟门卫做爱去了
I thought you'd have forgotten me, had sex with the door guard,

405
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,230
然后现在已经在去停车场的途中
and been halfway across the parking lot by now.

406
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,650
这个嘛 他对我没兴趣 所以就...
Yeah, well, he wasn't into me, so...

407
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,750
蒙羞之旅 二人成双
Walk of shame, party of two.

408
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,410
姑娘们 我听说你们被关起来了
Girls, I heard you got locked up.

409
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,250
是 我们必须做三十小时的社区服务
Yup. We have to do 30 hours of community service.

410
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,420
Caroline还在才艺秀里赢得了六分钟的
And Caroline won six minutes of privacy on the toilet

411
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,720
私人如厕时间
in the talent show.

412
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,640
其实也不是那么私人
Well, not so private.

413
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,060
我尿尿时还得跟一个穿着工作靴的女人
I had to tinkle while a woman in work boots

414
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,390
四目相对
made heavy eye-contact.

415
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,900
我进过一次监狱 因为我在错误的时间
I went to prison once for being at the wrong place

416
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
去了错误的地方
at the wrong time.

417
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,570
也就是说 我去了南部
Meaning, I was down south.

418
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,160
看看是谁从"大房子"监狱回来了
Look who's back from the big house.

419
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,780
对你来说 每个房子都是大房子 Han
Every house is a big house for you, Han.

420
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,660
小心脚下 有前科的人
Watch your step, ex-con,

421
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,080
否则我会以冒充服务生的名义让你回监狱去
or I'll get the to haul you back in for impersonating a waitress.

422
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,340
我不敢相信我会说这话 但我想这个地方了
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I missed this place.

423
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,090
我被困在监狱里 和我的姐妹Tanaya一起的时候...
When I was up in the pen, doing time with my girl, Tanaya...

424
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,960
所以 你也要参演女子监狱了吗?
Well, orange you the new black?

425
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,850
你们俩在女子监狱玩的开心吗?
So did you two have fun in ladies' prison?

426
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,960
跟我说说 是不是像我的那些
And tell me, is it anything like the 17 XXX movies

427
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,800
标着17禁的电影一样?
I have with that title?

428
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,690
好吧 我丢了我的两个最好的戒指
Okay, so I lost two of my best rings.

429
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,640
所以我连11美元都没了
So I'm out $11.

430
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,810
我意识到我比自己想的要坚强
I realized I'm tougher than I thought.

431
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,140
我在监狱里唱歌 有了一夜情
I sang in prison. I had a one-night stand.

432
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,280
我差不多赶上约翰尼·卡什了
I'm practically Johnny Cash.

433
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,950
你是约翰尼·没钱
Well, Johnny No Cash.
