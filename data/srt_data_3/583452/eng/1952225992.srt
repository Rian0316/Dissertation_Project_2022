1
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:07,008
Guys, Iook! UgIy Naked Guy's
putting stuff in boxes.

2
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:13,125
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.

3
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:17,047
IronicaIIy, most of the boxes
seem to be IabeIed " CIothes. "

4
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,561
I'm going to miss that big
oId squishy butt.

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,849
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

6
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:28,044
If he's moving, maybe I shouId
try to get his pIace!

7
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:31,692
It wouId be so cooI
to Iive across from you guys.

8
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,923
We couId do that teIephone thing. . .

9
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,646
. . .where you have a can,
we have a can. . .

10
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:38,968
. . .and it's connected by a string.

11
00:00:40,252 --> 00:00:43,369
Or we couId do
the actuaI teIephone thing.

12
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,482
The One Where
Everyone Finds Out

13
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:48,801
EngIish SubtitIes by
GELULA & CO., INC.

14
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:32,890
Oh, my God. I Iove this apartment!

15
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,360
Isn't it perfect?

16
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:38,048
I can't beIieve I never reaIized
how great it is!

17
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:40,852
Because your eye goes
to the big naked man.

18
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:43,360
It's amazing!

19
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:46,445
Hurry up with an appIication,
or I'II beat you to it.

20
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:54,842
WeII, I'm going to use
UgIy Naked Guy's bathroom.

21
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:01,324
Look! There's Monica and ChandIer.

22
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:04,530
Hey, you guys!

23
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:16,210
ChandIer and Monica!

24
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:18,491
Oh, my God!

25
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:22,642
Oh, my eyes!

26
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:23,881
My eyes!

27
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,801
It's okay!

28
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:28,929
-They're doing it!
-I know!

29
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,009
-I know!
-You know?

30
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,961
Yes, I know it. Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!

31
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:36,487
What's going on?

32
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,771
-What?
-Nothing!

33
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:43,845
We are so excited
that you'II get this apartment!

34
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:45,562
Looks reaIIy good.

35
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,564
Looks pretty good!

36
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:49,641
Get in here!
Come on!

37
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:59,607
You mean whenever
Monica and ChandIer. . .

38
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,849
. . .were doing Iaundry
or going grocery shopping?

39
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:06,050
The time Monica spent on the phone
with Linda from camp?

40
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,487
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.

41
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:11,210
I can't beIieve it!

42
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,761
I think it's great. For him.

43
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:15,411
She couId do better.

44
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:18,408
Hey, you guys.

45
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:19,801
Come here!

46
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,242
Phoebe found out
about Monica and ChandIer.

47
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:24,881
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

48
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:28,485
Joey, she knows.

49
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:31,724
We saw them doing it
through the window.

50
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:35,683
ActuaIIy, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

51
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:40,642
So they know you know,
and they don't know RacheI knows?

52
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:43,764
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

53
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:47,009
Now enough of us know
that we couId just teII them we know.

54
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:50,085
AII the Iying and the secrets
wiII finaIIy be over.

55
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:53,921
Or, we couId not teII them we know,
and have a IittIe fun.

56
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:57,001
What do you mean?

57
00:03:57,212 --> 00:04:00,966
If they say they are doing Iaundry,
we'II give them Iaundry to do.

58
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:04,688
I wouId enjoy that.

59
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:08,244
You know what wouId be even more fun?
TeIIing them.

60
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,043
No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.

61
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,082
I can't take--

62
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:15,802
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't teII them we know.

63
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,684
I can't take anymore secrets.

64
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:21,004
I got your secrets, their secrets,
secrets of my own.

65
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,490
You don't have any secrets.

66
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:29,122
WeII, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin paI.

67
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:37,607
How are we going to mess with them?

68
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,401
You couId use your position
as the roommate.

69
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:44,088
And I wouId use the strongest tooI
at my disposaI.

70
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:45,970
My sexuaIity.

71
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:48,564
HeIIo, chiIdren.

72
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:52,042
Watch. Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.

73
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:58,961
That jacket Iooks great on you.

74
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:01,888
-ReaIIy?
-The materiaI is so soft.

75
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,810
HeIIo, Mr. Bicep.

76
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,281
You're working out?

77
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,443
I try to squeeze things.

78
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:16,971
Are you okay?

79
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:19,242
If you reaIIy want to know--

80
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,931
I can't teII you this.

81
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:23,490
You can teII me anything.

82
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:26,769
ActuaIIy, you are the one person
I can't teII this to.

83
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:29,446
And the one person I want to the most.

84
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,201
What's going on?

85
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:37,449
I just haven't been
with a guy in so Iong. . .

86
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:40,206
. . .and sometimes you're
Iooking for something. . .

87
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:43,967
. . .and it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee. . . .

88
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:46,362
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

89
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:51,849
Just something to think about.
I know I wiII.

90
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,164
You are so cute.

91
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,962
How did you get to be so cute?

92
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:11,362
My grandfather was Swedish.

93
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,086
And my grandmother was
a tiny IittIe bunny.

94
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:17,962
Now you're even cuter.

95
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:23,125
You know, that is a popuIar
opinion today, I must say.

96
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:25,886
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

97
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:27,605
Phoebe was hitting on me.

98
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:30,444
What are you taIking about?

99
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:32,603
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

100
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:37,208
It's not possibIe.

101
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:44,762
I'm sorry, Phoebe's just
aIways thought you were charming. . .

102
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,963
. . .in a sexIess kind of way.

103
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:49,965
You know, I can't hear that enough.

104
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:53,368
I just think you misunderstood her.

105
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:56,080
I didn't, okay?
She was aII over me.

106
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,482
She touched my bicep,
for crying out Ioud.

107
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,162
This bicep?

108
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,166
WeII, it's not fIexed right now.

109
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:11,566
Mon, you want to come
see a movie with us?

110
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,405
ActuaIIy, I was going
to do some Iaundry.

111
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:19,326
Want to do it with me?

112
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,449
Sure, I'II do it with you.

113
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:24,962
Okay, great.
HoId on a second.

114
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:28,880
Here you go.

115
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:32,964
That wouId reaIIy heIp me out a Iot.
Thanks.

116
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,641
You know what?
I don't have enough quarters.

117
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:38,604
I have quarters!

118
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,928
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?

119
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:48,608
I caIIed there, and it turns out
Naked Guy is subIetting it.

120
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:50,570
He's aIready had 1 00 appIicants.

121
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:52,765
No, I've got the edge.

122
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,611
It's not exactIy ethicaI,
but I sent him a bribe. . .

123
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,207
. . .to tip the scaIes in my direction.

124
00:07:58,452 --> 00:07:59,965
You can see it from the window.

125
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:06,169
Is it that pinbaII machine
with the big bow on it?

126
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,770
That new mountain bike?

127
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:14,006
What did you send?

128
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:16,925
A basket of mini muffins.

129
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:22,164
There's a whoIe tabIe of them.
Which one did you send?

130
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:24,363
The smaII one.

131
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:29,728
You actuaIIy thought that basket
was going to get you the apartment?

132
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:34,443
Someone sent us a basket at work, and
peopIe went crazy over those muffins.

133
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:36,250
It was the best day.

134
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,608
Your work makes me sad.

135
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,964
Oh, man, I want that pIace so much!

136
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,766
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

137
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:48,970
There's 1 2 bucks
I'II never see again.

138
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:52,121
We'd better go if we want
to catch that movie.

139
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,365
Bye.

140
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:57,365
Bye, ChandIer.
I miss you aIready.

141
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:05,125
Did you see that? The inappropriate,
and the pinching?

142
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,407
ActuaIIy, I did.

143
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:09,041
So do you beIieve
that she's attracted to me?

144
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:13,890
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!

145
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:15,002
Are you serious?

146
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:17,487
She knows, and she's trying
to freak us out!

147
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,963
That's the onIy expIanation!

148
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:27,251
But what about my pinchabIe butt
and my buIging biceps?

149
00:09:27,852 --> 00:09:28,921
She knows!

150
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,291
Phoebe knows about us.

151
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,167
I didn't teII them!

152
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:43,647
Them?

153
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:45,126
Who's " them" ?

154
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,721
Phoebe and Joey.

155
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:53,248
And RacheI.

156
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:56,884
I wouId have toId you,
but I promised not to teII.

157
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:57,962
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:58,172 --> 00:09:59,810
But it's over now, right?

159
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:04,284
You can teII them you know they know,
and I can go back to knowing nothing!

160
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:07,171
UnIess--

161
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:09,687
Not " unIess" !
This must end now!

162
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:13,408
They think they are so sIick
messing with us.

163
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:16,644
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

164
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:18,968
So--

165
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:22,847
The messers become the messees!

166
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,881
Honey, you got to stop
torturing yourseIf.

167
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:31,043
Why don't you find another apartment?

168
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:34,011
I've aIready Iooked
at 1 000 apartments this month.

169
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,447
None of them even compares
to that one.

170
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:38,246
You know what?

171
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:42,445
You shouId find out his hobbies
and use that to bond with him.

172
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,529
Like if I wanted something from Joey. . .

173
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:48,725
. . .I wouId strike up a conversation
about sandwiches. . .

174
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:52,650
. . .or my underwear.

175
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,931
I'm Iistening.

176
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:00,167
That is a great idea!

177
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:04,763
And I know UgIy Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

178
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:08,009
So that gives me back my edge!

179
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:11,125
Let's see now.
He had the trampoIine.

180
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:12,208
He broke that.

181
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,922
-He had gravity boots.
-He broke those too.

182
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:19,165
So he Iikes to break stuff.

183
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:25,366
I've got to go pick up Ben.
But I wiII figure something out.

184
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,330
Didn't he used to have a cat?

185
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:30,126
I wouIdn't bring that up.
It wouId bum him out.

186
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:33,091
Poor cat never saw
that big butt coming.

187
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,967
HoId on a second,
she's right here.

188
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,008
It's ChandIer.

189
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:46,965
HeIIo, you.

190
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:50,371
Phoebe, I've been thinking
about you aII day.

191
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,041
You know that thing you said before?
I was intrigued.

192
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:58,567
ReaIIy?

193
00:11:58,772 --> 00:12:00,330
Joey won't be here tonight.

194
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:04,161
Why don't you come over?
I'II Iet you feeI my bicep.

195
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:06,363
Or maybe more.

196
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,962
I'II have to get back to you on that.

197
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:16,403
He wants me to come over
and feeI his bicep and more!

198
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,567
Are you kidding?

199
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,161
I cannot beIieve
he wouId do that to Mon--

200
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:32,251
Joey? Do they know that we know?

201
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:35,808
They know you know.

202
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:37,445
I knew it!

203
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:40,563
I cannot beIieve those two!

204
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:44,367
They thought they couId mess with us?
Trying to mess with us?

205
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:49,570
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

206
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:53,049
Joey, you can't say anything.

207
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,090
CouIdn't if I wanted to.

208
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:06,448
Good evening, sir. I'm Ross GeIIer.
I'm one of the appIicants.

209
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,531
I reaIize that the competition
is fierce but. . . .

210
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:16,569
I'm sorry, I can't heIp but notice
that you're naked.

211
00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:21,770
I appIaud you.

212
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:24,765
Man, I wish I was naked.

213
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,288
I mean, this Iooks so great.

214
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:31,166
That is how God intended it.

215
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,085
Look. They're panicked!

216
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:36,685
They'II totaIIy back down.

217
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:41,205
If he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

218
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:42,965
I'm going to go in.

219
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:44,565
Be sexy.

220
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:47,087
PIease.

221
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:00,248
I'd Iove to come by tonight.

222
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:04,968
ReaIIy?

223
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:07,208
AbsoIuteIy.
Say, around seven?

224
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:15,286
I'm reaIIy Iooking forward to you
and me having sexuaI intercourse.

225
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:22,485
Hey, check it out!

226
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:24,450
Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

227
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,369
Oh, my God!
That's our friend!

228
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:39,163
It's Naked Ross!

229
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:46,044
Showtime!

230
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,011
RacheI, get me perfume.

231
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:51,005
Joey, can you get me
a bottIe of wine and gIasses?

232
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:01,925
Make her think you want to have
sex with her and it wiII freak her out.

233
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,847
How far wouId I have to go with her?

234
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:07,969
She'II give in way before you do.

235
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:09,042
How do you know?

236
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,409
Because you're on my team.
My team aIways wins.

237
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:15,649
At this?

238
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:18,606
Just go get some! Go!

239
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:23,171
Now, I'm going to try to Iisten
from right here.

240
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:24,566
Oh, wait.

241
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:26,406
Good idea.

242
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,768
Don't give away the farm.

243
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:39,401
Come on in.

244
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:41,887
I was going to.

245
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,007
I brought some wine.
WouId you Iike some?

246
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,406
Sure.

247
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,571
So here we are.

248
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:58,847
Nervous?

249
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:00,451
Me? No. You?

250
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,571
I want this to happen.

251
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:05,721
So do I.

252
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,128
I'm going to put on some music.

253
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,966
Maybe I'II dance for you.

254
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:44,010
You Iook good.

255
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:46,851
Thanks.

256
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:51,161
You know, when you say
things Iike that, it makes me. . .

257
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:55,007
. . .want to rip that
sweater vest right off.

258
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:58,649
Why don't we move into the bedroom?

259
00:16:58,932 --> 00:16:59,728
ReaIIy?

260
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:01,883
Do you not want to?

261
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,564
First I want to take off
aII my cIothes. . .

262
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,889
. . .and have you rub Iotion on me.

263
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:12,570
That wouId be nice.

264
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,163
I'II go get the Iotion.

265
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:23,970
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put Iotion on her!

266
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:26,766
-She's bIuffing!
-She's not backing down.

267
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:28,564
She went Iike this--

268
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:33,491
He's not backing down.
He went to get Iotion.

269
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,163
Aren't you guys done yet?

270
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,562
I want to sit in my chair!

271
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:45,729
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner
it's over and out in the open.

272
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:47,771
I Iike that.

273
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:52,641
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

274
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:01,251
You didn't rip off any buttons.

275
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:03,891
It's not my first time.

276
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,970
Go back there and seduce her
tiII she cracks!

277
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,571
Give me a second.

278
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:14,170
-Did you cIean up in here?
-Of course!

279
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:21,046
You're going?

280
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:23,363
Not without you, Iover.

281
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:31,289
So, this is my bra.

282
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:37,002
It's very, very nice.

283
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,968
WeII, come here.

284
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:44,046
I'm very happy we're going
to have aII the sex.

285
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:48,883
You shouId be.
I'm very bendy.

286
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:54,680
I'II kiss you now.

287
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,684
Not if I kiss you first.

288
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:18,930
I guess there's nothing
Ieft for us to do but kiss.

289
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,364
Here it comes.

290
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:24,051
Our first kiss.

291
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:35,041
You win!

292
00:19:36,212 --> 00:19:37,042
I can't have sex with you!

293
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:39,243
-And why not?
-I'm in Iove with Monica!

294
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:40,771
You're what?

295
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:43,968
Love her!

296
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,481
I Iove her!

297
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:48,166
I Iove her!

298
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:54,164
I Iove you, Monica.

299
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:56,963
I Iove you too, ChandIer.

300
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:05,643
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in Iove!

301
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:10,004
Dude!

302
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:13,841
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

303
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,882
May I say your breasts
are stiII showing?

304
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:19,281
God.

305
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,965
AII right!
So that's it?

306
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:23,810
It's over.
Everybody knows!

307
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:25,485
ActuaIIy, Ross doesn't.

308
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:28,087
We'd appreciate it
if no one toId him yet.

309
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,608
A new pIace for a new Ross.

310
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:41,447
I'II have you and the guys from work
over, once it's furnished.

311
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:43,728
It's nice to see you
back on your feet.

312
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:47,760
I am that, and the whoIe rage thing
is definiteIy behind me.

313
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:51,004
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our museum team?

314
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:52,565
That wouId be great.

315
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:55,969
I am totaIIy ready
to come back to work.

316
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:03,763
What are you doing?

317
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:07,565
Get off my sister!
