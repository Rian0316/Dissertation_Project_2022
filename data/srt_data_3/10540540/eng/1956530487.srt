00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
<font color="green">Oh.</font>

154
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,600
<font color="green">Hmm.</font>

155
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,800
<font color="green">Must have been some kind of mix-up.</font>

156
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,600
<font color="green">Just the two of you here?</font>

157
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
<font color="white">Yes.</font>

158
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,640
<font color="green">Mind if I, uh, have a look around?</font>

159
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,760
<font color="white">Sure.</font>

160
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,440
<font color="green">All fine.</font><font color="white"> Yeah.</font>

161
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,840
<font color="green">Right.</font>

162
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,320
<font color="green">Guess I'll be on my way, then.</font>

163
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,240
<font color="white">OK.</font><font color="yellow"> OK.</font>

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,560
<font color="green">Wait.</font>

165
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
<font color="green">Is that apple strudel?</font>

166
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,720
<font color="white">Um... Yeah.</font>

167
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,720
<font color="green">Lovely.</font>

168
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,240
<font color="green">Yes, please!</font>

169
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,560
<font color="green">You made that yourself?</font>

170
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,320
<font color="white">No.</font>

171
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,880
<font color="green">Ah.</font>

172
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,680
<font color="white">INTERNALLY: I've never been so happy</font>
<font color="white">and so sad to see someone.</font>

173
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,080
<font color="green">I'd love it warm!</font>

174
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,600
<font color="white">Oven's broken.</font>

175
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,400
<font color="green">Right.</font>

176
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,120
<font color="green">Do you have any cream?</font>

177
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
<font color="green">Brilliant.</font>

178
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,840
<font color="green">Thanks.</font>

179
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,920
<font color="green">Mmm. It's lovely.</font>

180
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,280
<font color="green">Mmm.</font>

181
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,880
<font color="green">Best be careful at the moment,</font>
<font color="green">out there.</font>

182
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,720
<font color="white">Yeah.</font>

183
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,560
<font color="green">You heard about the murder?</font>

184
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,160
<font color="white">What murder?</font>

185
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
<font color="green">Guy who runs the motel.</font>

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,680
<font color="green">Only an hour up the road.</font>

187
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,600
<font color="white">What happened?</font>

188
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,760
<font color="green">I shouldn't really say.</font>

189
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,440
<font color="green">Got shot in the head, and then put</font>
<font color="green">in a cupboard.</font>

190
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,160
<font color="white">Right.</font>

191
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,200
<font color="green">I keep saying cupboard. It's</font>
<font color="green">wardrobe.</font>

192
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
<font color="green">Put him in a wardrobe.</font>

193
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,560
<font color="white">INTERNALLY: She wasn't having sex</font>
<font color="white">with him.</font>

194
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,280
<font color="white">She was killing him. Maybe both.</font>

195
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
<font color="green">Mm.</font>

196
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,600
<font color="green">It's probably why someone phoned</font>
<font color="green">about here.</font>

197
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,680
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,920
<font color="green">Well, there's always hoaxes and</font>
<font color="green">stuff, you know?</font>

199
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,520
<font color="green">After a murder.</font>

200
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,960
<font color="green">Just kids being silly.</font>

201
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,160
<font color="green">Calling us up. Hm-hm.</font>

202
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,960
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

203
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,960
<font color="green">That was delicious.</font>

204
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,600
<font color="green">What do I owe you?</font>

205
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,480
<font color="white">£2.</font>

206
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,080
<font color="green">£2.</font>

207
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,440
<font color="green">Mmm.</font>

208
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,800
<font color="white">Here you go.</font>

209
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,560
<font color="green">Hah. Don't need that.</font>

210
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,080
<font color="white">What about for your expenses or</font>
<font color="white">something?</font>

211
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,760
<font color="green">I'll pretend I didn't hear that!</font>

212
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,880
<font color="white">OK.</font>

213
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,600
<font color="green">Thank you very much, then.</font>

214
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,520
<font color="green">You all right?</font>

215
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

216
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,480
<font color="green">OK.</font>

217
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,280
<font color="green">Night, then.</font>

218
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,920
<font color="green">Stay safe.</font>

219
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,760
<font color="green">Oh, shit.</font>

220
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,480
<font color="green">Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.</font>

221
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,280
<font color="yellow">Lock the door.</font>

222
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,640
<font color="white">You killed him.</font>

223
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,280
<font color="white">The man at the motel.</font>

224
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,880
<font color="yellow">Sort of.</font><font color="white"> What?</font>

225
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,680
<font color="yellow">Where's James?</font>

226
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,320
<font color="white">I told you I don't know.</font>

227
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,080
<font color="white">INTERNALLY: Please stay where you</font>
<font color="white">are, James.</font>

228
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,080
<font color="white">CLATTER</font>

229
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,920
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

230
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,480
<font color="yellow">I can see you.</font>

231
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,320
<font color="white">POLICE OFFICER:</font><font color="green"> Come in. Please come</font>

233
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,720
<font color="green">I'm at the cafe on Forest Road.</font>

234
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
<font color="green">Suspect is an IC3 female. She has a</font>
<font color="green">gun.</font>

235

<font color="green">Repeat - she has a gun!</font>

236
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
<font color="white">Unbelievable.</font>

<font color="cyan">Sorry.</font>

238
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,560
<font color="yellow">See?</font>

239
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,280
<font color="yellow">You're a liar.</font>

240
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,200
<font color="white">I didn't know he was there till a</font>
<font color="white">minute ago.</font>

241
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
<font color="yellow">So why didn't you tell me?</font>

242
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,680
<font color="white">Because I don't want you to hurt</font>
<font color="white">him.</font>

243
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,240
<font color="white">So, what now? What are you gonna do?</font>

244
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,480
<font color="yellow">I'm gonna shoot you both.</font>

245
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,480
<font color="cyan">Why didn't you already?</font><font color="yellow"> What?</font>

246
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,200
<font color="cyan">Kill us.</font>

<font color="yellow">Because.</font><font color="cyan"> Because what?</font>

248
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,520
<font color="yellow">I wanted to talk to you first.</font><font color="white"> Why?</font>

249
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,880
<font color="yellow">So I could hear it from you.</font>

250
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,920
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font><font color="white"> Your boyfriend tried</font>
<font color="white">to rape me.</font>

251
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,640
<font color="white">So James stabbed him. What else is</font>
<font color="white">there to say?</font>

252
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,160
<font color="yellow">Why can't you tell the truth?</font>
<font color="cyan">That IS the truth!</font>

253
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,640
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

254
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,280
<font color="yellow">You were waiting for him, you broke</font>
<font color="yellow">into his house</font>

255
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,760
<font color="yellow">and you waited for him...</font>

257
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,080
<font color="white">There were other girls. You must</font>
<font color="white">know that.</font>

258
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,800
<font color="yellow">That was never proved.</font><font color="white"> What?</font>

259
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,520
<font color="white">There were loads.</font>

260
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,520
<font color="white">There was a video and photos. We saw</font>
<font color="white">them.</font>

261
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,200
<font color="yellow">You're wrong. It was different with</font>
<font color="yellow">me.</font>

262
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,720
<font color="white">How do you know he didn't have a</font>
<font color="white">plan?</font>

263
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,080
<font color="white">Maybe you were just lucky.</font>

264
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,560
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

265
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,360
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

266
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,240
<font color="yellow">He loved me.</font>

267
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,280
<font color="yellow">And you took him from me!</font>

268
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
<font color="yellow">You killed him!</font>

269
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,800
<font color="cyan">I killed him. Please, let her go.</font>

270
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
<font color="white">Fuck off, James.</font>

271
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,920
<font color="cyan">What?</font><font color="white"> Stop trying to save me.</font>

272
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,640
<font color="cyan">I... I don't... I...</font>

273
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,400
<font color="white">Yeah, we killed him.</font>

274
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,040
<font color="yellow">Then you have to get punished.</font>

275
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,960
<font color="yellow">People are supposed to get punished.</font>

276
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
<font color="white">You think we won't?</font>

277
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,840
<font color="white">I'm always in that house.</font>

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,600
<font color="white">I'm always in that room.</font>

279
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,120
<font color="white">I can't get out.</font>

280
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,320
<font color="white">Maybe I did some things I shouldn't</font>
<font color="white">have done,</font>

281
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,400
<font color="white">but I didn't deserve that.</font>

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,360
<font color="cyan">Please, Bonnie...</font>

283
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,080
<font color="cyan">None of us asked for this.</font>

<font color="white">so you don't give a shit any more.</font>

288
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,200
<font color="white">We're not gonna say sorry.</font>

289
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,880
<font color="white">If you wanna kill us, I get that.</font>

290
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,960
<font color="white">What happens next?</font>

291
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,560
<font color="white">What happens to you?</font><font color="cyan"> She's right.</font>

292
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,400
<font color="cyan">You might think you don't have a</font>

<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

296
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
