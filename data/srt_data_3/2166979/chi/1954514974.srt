Ripped by BluCola

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,400
我们现在可以签字了吧
So, if we're ready for signature...?

3
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:14,596
You can absolutely guarantee it'll
be the final leg?

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,800
你们能绝对保证那是最后一程吗
（12年伦敦奥运会火炬传递）

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,000
当然 不然就算违约

6
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:18,532
Anything else would be in breach
of contract. Who's giving it to me?

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,700
谁会递给我

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,500
问得好 Phoebe 谁递给她
Excellent question, Phoebe! Who's
giving it to her? Er... Anthony?

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,900
厄  Anthony 告诉她

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
嗯
Erm...

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,400
Dame Kelly Holmes
Dame Kelly Holmes.

12
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:30,584
Ooh...

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,200
我不认识她

14
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:35,500
I don't know who she is.
She's
an Olympic athlete. I don't care.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,000
- 她是奥运选手
- 我不在乎

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,200
我想要谁都行 不是吗 妈妈 
爸爸是这么说的

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,572
I can have who I want, can't I,
Mummy? Daddy said! Well, darling...

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,200
- 那个 亲爱的
- 为什么我要的就是得不到
Why can't I ever have
anything I want? Well, it's...

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,200
- 嗯 这个
- 我们还有别的选择吗

20
00:00:42,528 --> 00:00:45,588
Do we have any other choices?

21
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,564
Erm... Lord Coe.

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,600
- 厄 Coe议员
- 不行

23
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:53,508
No. Sir Ian Botham? No.
Sir Ian McKellen? No.

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,100
- Ian Botham爵士
- 不行

25
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,300
- Ian Mckellen爵士
- 不行

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,900
Justin Bieber
Justin Bieber. Yes?

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,100
行吗

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
就他了
He'll be fine. Marvellous.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,900
非常好

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,200
我们带来了一件复制品
这样Phoebe就有充分的时间准备了

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,564
We've brought along a replica
so that Phoebe has
plenty of time to prepare.

32
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,900
你从Justin手中接过来
So, you pick up from Justin,
then it's up the steps

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,100
走上台阶 就这么简单

34
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:23,532
and Bob's your uncle.
You're a very lucky girl.

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,800
姑娘 你很幸运

36
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,300
事实上这跟运气没啥关系

37
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:29,516
Actually, it has nothing to do
with luck. My Daddy is very,
very, very rich.

38
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,900
我爸爸非常

39
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,500
非常 非常有钱

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
她以她爸爸为豪
She's v proud of her father.

41
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,100
他说了 我能拥有我想要的一切
因为我是他的小公主
And he says I can have whatever
I want, because I'm his princess.

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,000
没错 你的确是
Yes, you are.
So, all we need now is
your sponsorship cheque. Of course.

43
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,300
现在只差你的赞助支票了

44
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,500
没问题

45
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,000
很好 这真是莫大的荣幸
Good. Well, it's been an
absolute pleasure. How exciting!

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,000
多激动人心啊

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,900
Lucinda一定会气疯的
Lucinda will be completely sick.
All she's doing is a stupid dance.

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,100
她只能去跳那只傻得要死的舞

49
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:09,552
She'll be one of hundreds,
but I'll be special.

50
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,500
她就是一群众演员
而我将是最特别的一个

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,500
没错 你会的 宝贝
Yes, you will, poppet.

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,200
那么接下来呢
So what happens now?

53
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,700
大概一周后 你就能收到所有的书面材料
All the paperwork will come through
in about a week or so - rehearsal
dates, VIP passes, details, etc.

54
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,400
包括彩排日期 贵宾通行证 各种细节等等

55
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:23,552
Just make sure you've marked
July 27th on your calendar.

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,800
你只需要确保你能记住7月27号这一天

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
毫无疑问
Abso-bloody-lutely!

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,700
Phoebe 说谢谢 
Say thank you, Phoebe.

59
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:37,516
She's highly strung. V creative.

60
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,500
她一直神经紧绷

61
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,400
非常有创造力

62
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,400
噢 上帝会保佑她的
Oh, bless her.

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,900
如何

64
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:49,584
How'd it go? Like taking candy
from a baby. Ah-ha.

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,000
- 轻而易举
- 啊哈

66
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,200
真有趣 你总是会特别钟情于某些工作
It's funny how you enjoy some jobs
more than others.

67
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,600
那是这些人值得拥有
Some people are more deserving
than others.

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,100
- 所以干得更带劲
- 嗯 的确如此 
Makes it all the sweeter.
Yes, it does. Mind you...

69
00:02:57,536 --> 00:03:01,540
A hundred grand ain't to be sniffed
at. No. It's a lot of clothes.

70
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,600
主意 10万英镑可不容小觑

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,300
的确不容忽视 
可以买很多衣服呢

72
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,900
实话说 反正他们钱多
To tell you the truth,
they had way too much money anyway.

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,800
仔细想想 我们跟侠盗罗宾汉有点儿像

74
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:07,512
I mean, when you think about it,
we're a bit like Robin Hood.

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
是啊 我们确实从富人那儿弄钱

76
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:08,596
Yeah, well,
we do take from the rich...

77
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,500
- 只不过不捐给穷人
- 我们拿来买衣服
Only instead of giving it
to the poor... We buy clothes.

78
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,700
- 还是挺低调的
- 的确
Which isn't quite as catchy.
No - but we look great.

79
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,200
但是我们就是酷毙了

你会爱上奥林匹克的
You've gotta love the Olympics.

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,900
除了事实上他们把
Apart from the fact they're turning
the East End into
a chinless wonder's paradise.

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,900
伦敦东区变成了傻帽们的天堂

86
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,300
目前为止 我们已经卖出了
12个不存在的行政包厢

87
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,564
So far, we've sold
12 non-existent executive boxes

88
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:13,592
and three Olympic torch runs.

89
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,200
还有3个奥运火炬接力的名额

90
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:16,576
She was such a brat.

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
她真是讨人厌的小贱人

92
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,100
是啊 所以国家才会被搞成这样

93
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:19,572
Yeah... The way some people
bring up their children.

94
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,800
看看他们都怎么教孩子的

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,500
我在她这个年纪就只有
冰冻果子露和呼啦圈
All I had at her age was
a Sherbet Dib Dab and a hula hoop.

96
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
- 我每次都能轻松赢你
- 你吹牛的吧

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,504
I used to beat you hands down
every time. You bragging?

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,300
他们都叫我 水蛇腰肯尼迪

99
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:29,548
Snake Hips Kennedy, they used
to call me. He was such a girl.

100
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,600
实际上 这名字是他自己取的
他就是小弱受啊

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,900
不就是因为我总能打败你嘛
Only cos I used to beat you.

102
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,400
没错 因为你一直不把
我的呼啦圈还给我 这就是原因

103
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,568
Yes, because I couldn't
get it off you, that's why.

104
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,800
好了 孩子们
All right, children - we've made
100 grand, you can all have hoops.

105
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,300
我们刚有了10万
一人一打呼啦圈就不嫌多

106
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,700
你确定Albert这个年纪
还转得动呼啦圈吗 要转出人性命来的
Sure that's wise at Albert's age?
He might do himself a mischief. Oh?

107
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,300
我就来教你们小年轻一两手吧

108
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,556
Well, I could teach you youngsters
a thing or two.

109
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,500
你可以的 Albert
Yes, you could.

110
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,800
- 我算是明白你们了
- 咋了

111
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,576
I've worked something out about
you lot. You're like big kids. Yeah?

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
- 你们就是一群小毛孩子
- 是吗

113
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
你说有了10万所以一人一打
呼啦圈的时候就整明白了
I realised when you said you had
a 100 grand so everyone
could have hoops.

114
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:56,552
Who in their right mind,
if they had a 拢100,000,

115
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
哪个正常人会

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,900
想着用10万英镑去买呼啦圈

117
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:58,556
would spend it on hoops?

118
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,500
- Eddie 呼啦圈哪得罪你了
- 他可是呼啦圈代言人啊

119
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:02,572
He's hoopist. Could've had
a bad experience as a child.

120
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,200
- 也许是小时候有什么阴影了
- 是啊 挥之不去啊

121
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:06,516
Yeah, he got all tangled up...
Couldn't quite get the rhythm...

122
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,900
- 跟不上节奏什么的
- 我就是这个意思

123
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,400
看见没 你们就是一群
倒霉催的捣蛋鬼

124
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,560
See? You're like big kids,
messing about...

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,000
你是有什么要说吗 Ed
还只是在乱吼一通
Are you making a point here, Ed,
or just having a Northern rant?

126
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,528
There is a point, actually.

127
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,800
事实上 我是有事要说

128
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,540
One of you did this to Rushie!

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
你们当中某个人对Rushie干了什么

130
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,500
等等 你怎么知道是我们干的
Hang on.
How do you know it was one of us?

131
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,700
因为是昨晚发现的
那是只有你们在这儿
Cos it happened last night,
and you were the only ones in here.

132
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,800
- 好吧
- 好吧 所以呢 是谁干的
Right. Right? So? Who was it?

133
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,300
不管是谁干的 他肯定不会画画
看看这胡子画得多糟糕
Well, whoever it was can't draw,
cos his moustache is rubbish.

134
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:34,564
That's his real one.

135
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,900
那是他的真胡子

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,300
你们玷污了他 看看他
You've defiled him! Look at him!

137
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,500
可简直罪无可恕
It's not right, this!
This man was poetry in shorts.

138
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,200
他可是体育界的诗人

139
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,576
Summat funny, Michael?

140
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,300
有什么好笑的 Michael

141
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,000
不好笑 对不起
No. Sorry.

142
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,300
好吧 除非有人承认
否则你们就是黑名单
Eh? Barred?

143
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
- 诶
- 黑名单？

144
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,100
- 这有点过了吧 Ed
- 是啊 我们可是合伙人啊
That's a bit strong, innit Ed?

145
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:55,564
Especially as we're your partners.

146
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,700
你们平时取笑羞辱我就算了
I don't mind all the banter
and the general abuse,
but this is going too far!

147
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,100
但这个太过分了

148
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,300
好吧 我想最好有人承认
All right, I think someone
better own up.

149
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,584
What you looking at me for?
Well, you're the football nut.

150
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,700
- 你们看着我干嘛
- 你是铁杆球迷

151
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,900
- 喂喂 又不是所有球迷都是流氓
- 反正不是我
Oi, oi, we're not ALL hooligans.
Well, it wasn't me.

152
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,700
够了 你们全都上黑名单
直到我找出是谁干的

153
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:17,540
Right, well - you're barred, all
of you, till I find out who done it.

154
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:21,524
I mean it!

155
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,900
我没开玩笑

156
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,300
- 走吧
- 走吧 快点
Let's go. Well, go on. Come on.

157
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,500
- 黑名单
- 黑名单
Barred? Barred!

158
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
说真的 伙计们
I'm serious, guys.
It's taken me years to teach Eddie
how to make a proper breakfast.

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,800
我花了好几年才教Eddie
做出像样的早餐

160
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
没错 更别说
失去我们的办公室了

161
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,596
Yes - not to mention
losing our office.

162
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,100
是啊 他那疯狂的利物浦球迷心
已经被点燃了
Yeah, well,
he's got that Scouse resolve.

163
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:51,596
He won't give up till one of us
admits it.

164
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
除非我们中有人承认了
否则他不会放弃的

165
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,100
所以 到底是谁干的
So go on. Who was it?

166
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:05,580
ALBERT COUGHS UNEASILY

167
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,592
I'm Spartacus. You?!

168
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
- 我有份
- 你

169
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:14,576
I did the ears.
I er...I did the glasses.

170
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,900
- 我画了耳朵
- 我 厄

171
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,200
我画了眼镜

172
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:16,576
And the beard?

173
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,300
那谁画的胡子

174
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
准备好了吗 看着
Ready for this? Watch.

175
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:35,504
THEY ALL GIGGLE AND MUTTER

176
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:54,516
(Hide the pen.)

177
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,700
看见没
See...?

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
嗯 这么做太幼稚了 不是吧

179
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:59,596
Well, that wasn't very grown-up,
was it? Albert started it.

180
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,600
Albert开的头

181
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,700
- 嘿 你个小八卦
- 噢 得了吧 那根本就...
Hey, you snitch.
Oh, come on, don't even start.

182
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,900
行了 够了

183
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:04,560
All right, that's enough,
that's enough.

184
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,000
我们晚点再担心Eddie吧

185
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,532
We can worry about Eddie later.
Albert's got a new mark. Oh, who?

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,200
- Albert找到了新目标
- 噢 谁

187
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,400
这个有点以公谋私了
It's er.. kind of personal.

188
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,800
Ash 能帮我一下吗
Ash, would you...help me out?

189
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,000
这是Dexter Gold 当然不是本名
This is Dexter Gold.
That's not his real name, he changed
it by deed poll four years ago.

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,700
四年前他用改名契改了名

191
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,100
- 他真名是什么
- Dexter Pratt
What's his real name? Dexter Pratt.

192
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,300
他建立了一个叫“黄金兑现金”的网站
Started up a "Gold Hard Cash"
website when the economy
went into turmoil

193
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
趁着大萧条的时候

194
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,500
发了点小财
and he made a small fortune.

195
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,600
与时俱进嘛
Classy guy.

196
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,700
路数就是有人手头紧了

197
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,572
People who needed a few extra pounds
saw his ads in the papers,
sent their jewellery in,

198
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
在报纸上看到他的广告

199
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,100
把珠宝交给他

200
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:42,568
and he conned them by paying out
a fraction of what it was worth.

201
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,500
他骗他们说那只值
实际价值的一小部分

202
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,100
我是这样发现他的
That is how I found him.

203
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:47,520
INDISTINCT CHATTER

204
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,900
失陪一下 
Excuse me for just for a moment.
Sorry.

205
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,200
夫人
Madam?

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Vivienne Marchant的丈夫
三年前去世了
'Vivienne Marchant hit hard times

207
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
之后她的日子就很艰难
'when her husband died
three years ago.'

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
- 最糟的是 我觉得自己太傻了
- 噢 不会 不是的
The worst thing is,
I feel so stupid.

209
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:07,556
Oh, no, no.

210
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
以前只要是报纸上
There was a time, when if it
was in a newspaper written in
black and white, it was true!

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
白纸黑字写的 那就不会有假

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
- 美好的岁月啊
- George肯定会很生气

213
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:14,560
Better days.
My George would be furious.

214
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,900
他一定会冲过去给他点教训
He'd have gone round there,
given him what for.

215
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,564
I'm sure he would.

216
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,900
- 我相信
- 我也试过了

217
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:22,540
I tried! He just laughed at me.

218
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,700
他却取笑我

219
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,556
Said the conditions were
written down.

220
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,300
说是条件都下笔成书了

221
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
无疑是用小号字体写的
In small print, no doubt.

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,600
Albert 你能帮我真是太好了

223
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,508
It's really good of you to help me,
Albert.

224
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,700
亲爱的 这年头你一定要非常小心
You can't be too careful who you
trust these days, my dear.

225
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,500
这世界变了

226
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,572
The world isn't what it was.
After all, you only met me, what,

227
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,400
你看 我们也只认识了三天

228
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:41,572
three days ago?
I could be a con-man too.

229
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,500
我也可能是个骗子啊

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
噢 别傻了
Oh, don't be so daft!

231
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,524
DOG GROWLS QUIETLY

232
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,000
她给那杂种送去了这些 听着
She sent this piece of filth -
listen to this -

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
一对24K金戒指 一个钻石胸针

234
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:55,592
two 24 carat gold rings,
a diamond brooch.

235
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:58,552
60 years of memories.

236
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,400
60年的记忆啊

237
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,700
他给了她28.5英镑
He sent her back 拢28.50.

238
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,800
- 混蛋 - 我们要是不把这贱人
骗的每一分钱都讨回来
Bastard. If we don't take this bloke
for every penny he's got,

239
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
你去就扇他耳巴子当锻炼

240
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:12,512
I'll smack him in the mouth
just for fun.

241
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,200
别担心 Ash 我们会搞定他的

242
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,560
Don't worry, Ash, he'll receive
our full attention.

243
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,800
啊 是的 不过有点小问题
Ah, yes,
there is a bit of a problem.

244
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:19,536
Isn't there always?

245
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,600
不总会有问题吗

246
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,508
Michael?

247
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,300
Michael

248
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,100
我们查了一下
We checked him out and his
Gold Hard Cash business, it seems,

249
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,100
似乎他的黄金兑现金业务

250
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:30,516
is just a sideline.

251
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,800
只是他的副业

252
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,800
他与2008年发生在Gatwick的
He was connected to the gold bullion
robbery at Gatwick in 2008

253
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,900
还有去年Tottenham仓库的

254
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,300
金块抢劫案都有关系

255
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:38,564
and the Tottenham warehouse
gold heist last year. He's a fence?

256
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,700
他是销赃人？

257
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,800
他是被盗金块销赃的中间人
He's a middle man
for stolen gold bullion.

258
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,700
他利用他的黄金兑现金业务

259
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:45,528
He uses his Gold Hard Cash
business as a cover to melt it down
and sell it on.

260
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,100
做掩护 把金块熔掉 然后出售

261
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,300
这点会影响他的骗子身份吗
What difference does it make if he's
a crook? Well, he's not just
a crook, he's one of the chaps.

262
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
他不仅是骗子 他还是金主之一

263
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,900
* When the pimp's in the *
* Crib drop it like it's hot *
# When the pimp's in the crib
Drop it like it's hot

264
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,300
* Drop it like it's hot *
* Drop it like it's hot *

265
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,512
# Drop it like it's hot

266
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:06,596
# Drop it like it's hot

267
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,800
* When the pigs try to give it you *
# When the pigs try to give it you

269
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,596

00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:11,560
# Park it like it's hot

# Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot

273
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,556
# Pop it like it's hot... #

274
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,548
So, because of the circles

275
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,400
所以考虑到他混迹的圈子

276
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:22,584
he mixes in, we don't want him
coming after us.

277
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,200
我们不希望他盯上我们

278
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,548
Or worse, telling one
of his gangster friends

279
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,500
或者更糟糕的是 
他告诉某个黑帮的朋友

280
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,000
他被骗了 他会给他们更高的报酬
he's been conned and offering them a
better deal if they take care of us.

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,900
只要他们搞定我们

282
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,100
所以我们如果接手
So, if we do this, we need to
close it off when we're done.

283
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
我们就得结束的干干净净的

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,100
同意吧
Agreed? Yeah. Yeah.

285
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,600
- 没问题
- 行

286
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,800
很好 那我们开始吧
Good. Then let's find a way in.

287
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,600
搞定了

288
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:47,580
Bish bosh, job's a good 'un.

289
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
写支票吧 寄到
Write the cheque, send it to
Number One, Winners Street,
Daddy's bringing home the bacon.

290
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,100
Winners大街1号 一切就OK了

291
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,000
我说了是24K
When I said this deal was 24 carat,
was I right or was I wrong? Hang on.

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,700
没说错吧 等等

293
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
要聊天 下班后
Talk on your own time.

294
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,700
你敢再碰一下那手机
我就用它爆你的菊花
You touch that bleedin' phone again
and I'll shove it up your jacksy.

295
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
我没说错吧
So was I right or wrong?

296
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,800
别 别只是笑嘻嘻敷衍我嘛 Peter
直接了当
No, don't just laugh and say "Yeah,"
Peter, actually say the words...

297
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
我说得对不对

298
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:13,552
Was I right or wrong?

299
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,700
就是嘛 钱还没出去事就搞定了
Exactly, you get your deal sorted
out before you spend your money.

300
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,800
明白了不
Capiche?

301
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
我们是中间人 不是投资者

302
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:19,564
We're middle men not investors,

303
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,500
我们能成 他们也就成 明白吗
when we get the deal,
they get the deal, OK?

304
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,900
好了滚吧 听我的话
Now sod off and next time
listen to me instead of

305
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,400
别相信你浪费了五年时间
读的那个没用的商学位

306
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:27,560
that poxy business degree you wasted
five years of your life on.

307
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,700
Shania 请你的大屁股移驾过来
Shania, get your arse over here.

308
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,700
我的杯子是空的
Me mug's empty.

309
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,536
Excuse me?

310
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,700
什么意思

311
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,200
我跟你说什么来着
茶 我进来就要喝
What have I told you?
Mug of tea, the minute I get in.

312
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,700
他喜欢电影
Well, he likes his movies.

313
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,100
- 电影?
- 对 我刚黑进了他的网络DVD租赁账户

314
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:54,520
Movies? I hacked into
his online DVD rentals account.

315
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,800
- 他三周租了27部电影
- A片?
He's got 27 films in three weeks.

316
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,548
Porn?

317
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
最诡异的是 不是A片 
看样子都是些战争片

318
00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:01,500
Strangely enough, no, they all look
like war films. War? Yeah.

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,900
- 战争?
- 对 这意味着什么

320
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,700
- 他喜欢看人被打中被炸飞
- 真棒
What does that say about him?
That he likes to watch people
being shot and blown up. Nice.

321
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,000
如果他喜欢战争电影...

322
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,556
If he likes war movies...
What about this?

323
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,800
这个如何

324
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,800
看样子卡扎菲在美国佬对他乱枪扫射时
It looks like Gadaffi was trying to
ship out some of his goodies

325
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
正想把他的一些财产转移

326
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:18,528
while the Yanks took pot shots
at him and a couple of truck loads
went missing.

327
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,300
几车货失踪了

328
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,600
其中一车被认为载有金条

329
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:20,544
One of which was thought to be
gold bullion.

330
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,300
他们认为是游击队干的

331
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:22,532
They think it's a rogue army unit.

332
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,100
我们就用这个做背景?
So we use this as our back story?

333
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,400
干嘛不呢 这也符合他的个性
Why not? It fits his personality.

334
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,400
这是真事 所以经得起调查
It's true, so it'll check out,

335
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,800
也省了我们特地设套引他入局
and it saves time having to set
something up from scratch.

336
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
- 嗨
- 你好
Hi. How you doing?

337
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
- 给你
- 谢了 再见
There you go. Thanks, bye. Cheers.

338
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,400
再见

339
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,200
真的 他性别歧视

340
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:39,560
Honestly, he is so sexist,
apparently every woman in flat shoes
is a lesbian.

341
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,400
他显然认为穿平底鞋的都是蕾丝边

342
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,552
No wonder he hasn't got
a girlfriend.

343
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,800
难怪他没有女朋友

344
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,900
问题是 Baz

345
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,800
分销货物对我们没好处
Thing is, Baz,
splitting up consignments

346
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:53,504
ain't doing us any favours, we need
someone who can take the lot.

347
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,400
我们需要个能吞下大头的

348
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
我待会要见个德国老鬼
I'm seeing this German geezer
later on,

349
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,600
他说我们手头有的他都能收了
he says he can take
whatever we've got.

350
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,100
我不是要耍花样
I ain't trying to pull a fast one,

351
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:11,560
but a troy ounce of gold was 875
quid when I woke up this morning.

352
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,700
但目前一金衡盎司黄金

353
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,800
市值875英镑

354
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,536
Now, unless you know
something I don't,

355
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,700
除非你知道些有的没的

356
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,500
不然为什么我的价要低于这个数呢
why would I get less than that?

357
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,300
你国内收的我们可以给875镑
We'll give you 875
for your domestic business,

358
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,800
但我们有消息
but we are aware that sometimes
your sources are not always...

359
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,000
有时你的货源并不...

360
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
合法?

361
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:26,528
legitimate?

362
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,500
如果你想跟我们合作
So, if you want to use us

363
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,200
又不想我们过问"这东西打哪儿来"
but you don't want us to ask,
"Where is it coming from?"

364
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,600
那我们就要便宜点了 对吧
then we like to pay
a little less, ja?

365
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
好 好
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,900
那么...你们能吃进多少货
So, uh...how much can you take?

367
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,100
没有上限
We have no upper limit.

368
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,800
- 付费方式呢
- 你喜欢哪种
And payment?
What's your preference?

369
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,600
现金
Cash.

370
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,700
德国反洗钱法案

371
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:50,560
The money laundering laws
are very stringent in Germany.

372
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,100
管得很严

373
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,400
- 汇票或直接转账
- 可以
Bankers draft or direct transfers.
Agreed.

374
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,300
我们直接转账的最高额度是2百万欧元
We have a 2m euro ceiling
on direct transfers.

375
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,000
看样子你是找到英国的供货商了
Looks like you've found
your UK supplier.

376
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,600
你看 靠熔掉那些感觉自己
被骗的老家伙送上门的首饰
You see, melting down trinkets sent
in by wrinklies feeling the pinch

377
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,300
我可建不起新泳池 对吧 Barry
这可是大实话
ain't going to build my new pool,
is it, Barry? Let's be honest.

378
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,900
商人就要不遗余力地榨取利润...
And the dealers are squeezing
all the margins, so...

379
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,548
the Krauts have agreed
to take whatever we can supply,

380
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,300
德国佬已经说了他照单全收

381
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,400
没上限
no upper limit.

382
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,500
咣当打开收银机 收下零钱
So, bish bosh, open up the till,
keep the change.

383
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,600
那我们从何入手呢 老板
So, when do we start, boss?

384
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,100
我跟他说下周末会给他第一批货
I told him I'd send him his first
shipment at the end of next week.

385
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,300
有几个小子在筹划大买卖
There's a couple of the lads
planning jobs.

386
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:49,500
A cargo terminal at Stansted
and an Arab bank in Kensington.

387
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,400
Stansted的一个货运码头
还有Kensington一家阿拉伯银行

388
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
但还得等几周 要是金子不够
But they're a few weeks away,
so, if there's no hooky gold about,

389
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,700
那就多打些平面广告

390
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,508
let's get a few more
press ads running.

391
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,700
编织杂志 登些会吓到傻帽们的

392
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:57,576
Knitting magazines, something
to terrify the bingo squad,

393
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,100
"经济衰退 油价飞涨"
"Recession to bite deep,
fuel prices to soar.

394
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,600
"羊毛衫和蓝色染发剂的价格即将冲顶"
"The cost of cardigans and blue
rinses to go through the roof.

395
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,800
"如果你暖气都开不了了 婚戒何用"
"What use is your wedding ring
if you can't turn the heating on?"

396
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:11,536
Maybe do a special offer for widows!

397
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,900
也许可以给寡妇特价

398
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
我喜欢你这手 Baz
I like what you did there, Baz.

399
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,300
从家庭主妇入手
Yeah. And then let's start with
the housewives, make 'em feel guilty

400
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,000
让她们对自己守着黄金却
没让孩子玩上最新的电子游戏

401
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:22,596
about their kids
not having the latest video games

402
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,100
而心怀愧疚

403
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:25,568
while they're still
dripping in gold.

404
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,400
弄些孩子们哭的照片
Do some photos of kids...crying.

405
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,520
Right, get on with it!
I'm on it, boss!

406
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,000
- 对吧 快去办
- 这就去 老板!

407
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,200
大踏步前进 Baz

408
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,560
Big push, Baz, OK?

409
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Shania
Shania?

410
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,500
Sean 有什么收获
Sean, what have you got?

411
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,000
根据他助理的说法 他单身
Well, according to his PA,
he's single,

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,300
通常状态是周旋于几个女朋友之间
in between girlfriends,
which is his usual state,

413
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,800
不是任何俱乐部的成员 只喝香槟
he's not a member of any clubs,
only drinks champagne,

414
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,900
尤好宝林歇 讨厌狗

415
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:52,524
preferably Bollinger, hates dogs,
women in flat shoes

416
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,200
穿平底鞋的女人和黄油布丁

417
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:55,556
and bread-and-butter pudding.
And his lucky number's five.

418
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
幸运数字是5

419
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,100
支持热刺 从不去现场看球

420
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:58,532
So... Supports Tottenham,
never goes to live matches,

最喜欢的颜色是金色
Favourite colour's gold.
On the rare occasion

426
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,600
极少数情形下会参加化妆舞会

427
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,500
会装扮成金手指
he does go to a fancy dress party
he goes as Auric Goldfinger,

428
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,300
007里面的人物 但谁都看不出来
the bloke from the Bond film,
but no-one ever knows who he is.

429
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,200
他还有只叫Goldie的鹦鹉

430
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:17,516
Oh, and he's got a parrot
named Goldie.

431
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,300
好吧 Emma?
OK. Emma? He's listed as a director
of 11 companies, all gold-related,

432
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,500
他是11家公司的董事 
都是做黄金生意的

总营业额达三百万英镑
with a combined turnover of 拢3m,

434
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,900
我想他算是过了贫困线了
so, I think we can say
he's above the poverty line.

435
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
道具?

436
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,700
一切就绪 随时可以开始
Props?
Everything's in place, ready to go.

437
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,100
我们的饵呢
And what about our bait?

438
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,700
饵嘛...
Ah, our bait...

439
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,800
...看着有点像...
..looks a little something like...

440
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,700
...这样
..this.

441
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:46,584
Ooh...

442
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,000
是真的吗
Wow. Is that real?

443
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,528
Oh, yes.

444
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,200
- 对
- 值差不多三万二

445
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:53,588
32 grand's worth, give or take.

446
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:57,500
It's rented, so it has to go back
in one piece when we're done.

447
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,000
是租的 搞定后得完璧归赵

448
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
这该能引起他注意了

449
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,568
That should get his attention.

450
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,800
他四点在郊区有个会面
Oh... He's got a four o'clock
meeting out in the sticks.

451
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
让我们请君入瓮吧
Then let's bring him in.

452
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,500
MUSIC BLARES

453
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,536
HE SINGS TUNELESSLY

454
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,588
THUD OF AN IMPACT

455
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:29,552
Hngh...?!

456
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,200
- 你想死吗
- 不想
Do you want to die? No.

457
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
15秒内 会有六个人从林子里出来
In about 15 seconds, six blokes
are going to come out of the woods.

458
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,800
他们会先杀了我 在杀你取乐
They'll kill me first,
then shoot you just for fun.

459
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,300
进车里去 开车
So, get in the car and drive.

460
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,800
快
Now!

461
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,500
他上车了
He's in.

462
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,560
They jumped me on the way back
from their so-called dealers.

463
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,600
他们在我见了所谓的经销商后
回去的路上埋伏我

464
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,200
肯定是个圈套
It must have been a setup.

465
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
不 不 我搭了辆便车
No, no, no, I flagged a ride.

466
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,800
不 他只是一般人 没事的
No, he's a civilian, it's all right.

467
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,000
我一小时内回去 你放心吧
I'll be back in an hour,
you just sit tight.

468
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,100
听着 很抱歉把你拖进来
OK, look, I'm sorry
to drag you into this,

469
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,800
只是我走投无路了 
你又恰好在那出现
but I was up shit creek
and you just happened to be there.

470
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,100
你救我一命
You saved my life.

471
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,000
我欠你的
I owe you one.

472
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,536
Who was after you?

473
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,500
是谁在追杀你

474
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,700
一群贪婪的混蛋
Greedy bastards, that's who.

475
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600
你救了我 这需要勇气

476
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:51,500
But you got me out and that takes
guts. You ever been in the forces?

477
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,500
你当过兵吗

478
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,000
没有 我想过加入自卫队

479
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,572
No. I thought about the TA once.

480
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:56,556
Oh, you should do it. Yeah? Yeah.

481
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,700
- 你该去试试
- 是吗

482
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,800
嗯

483
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,548
Is that what I think it was?

484
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
那东西是我以为的东西吗

485
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,500
是又怎样
What if it was?

486
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,700
我听到你讲电话了 经销商什么的
I heard you on the phone,
about the dealer.

487
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,000
- 你是要给我惹麻烦吗 小子
- 不 不
Am I going to have trouble
with you, son? No, no.

488
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,800
事实上 我就是干这个的
The thing is, that's what I do.

489
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,300
- 什么
- 我是个黄金经销商
What?

490
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,520
I'm a gold dealer.

491
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,500
是啊 是啊 当然了
Yeah, yeah, course you are.

492
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,500
听着 谢谢你载我 打搅之处请原谅
Listen, thanks for the ride,
sorry for the inconvenience.

493
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,900
不 不 听着 这是我的名片

494
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:31,556
No! No, look, look. Here's my card.

495
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
如果你有东西要出手 
我可以找到买家
If you got something to sell,
I can find a buyer.

496
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,500
你觉得奏效了吗
You think it worked?

497
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,700
所谓贪婪嘛

498
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:05,524
Well, that's the thing about greed.
It's very predictable.

499
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,300
就是非常容易预知

500
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,500
很好
Great.

501
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,900
Sean 明早你能把我们弄进他办公室吗
Sean, can you get us into
his offices tomorrow morning?

502
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,300
可以 我给Shania打个电话
她是我最新密友
Yeah, I'll call Shania,
my new best friend.

503
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,532
Look, we've got to do something
about Eddie. Yeah, I said that.

504
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,300
听着 Eddie那边我们得想想办法

505
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,600
嗯 我也那么说来着

506
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,600
来了
There we go. Enjoy.

507
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,400
慢用

508
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,800
- Eddie那边我们得想想办法
- 我有个主意
We need to do something about Eddie.
I have an idea. Oh, yeah?

509
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,400
- 是吗
- 我要求助场外观众

510
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,560
I'm going to call in a favour.

511
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,536
PHONE RINGS

512
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,000
你好 Eddie酒吧
Hello, Eddie's bar.

513
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,900
- 我是Ian Rush
- 什么
It's Ian Rush here. 'What?'

514
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,300
拜托 真是可悲 你声音根本不像他

515
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:38,516
Do me a favour, that's pathetic.
You don't even sound like him.

516
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,200
听着 我不知道你哪位 
但你告诉那帮家伙
Hey, listen, I don't know who
you are, but you can tell that lot

517
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,500
我不像他们想的那么蠢 懂吗 你他...
that I'm not as stupid as they
think I am, all right? Ya f...

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
好办法 可惜他不信我们
Nice try, but he didn't believe us.

519
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,560
OK. Albert, Emma.
See if you can work on him.

520
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,700
好吧 Albert Emma 
看你们能不能搞定他

521
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,600
为什么是我 我可没在
他的足球英雄照片上画耳朵
Hey, why me? I didn't draw ears
on his football hero!

522
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,800
- 他对你耳朵比较软
- 我可不会为让Ash吃上热食就跟他上床
He's got a soft spot for you.
I'm not sleeping with him
just so Ash can have a fry up.

523
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,500
- 那是你的问题了 Ems 你真自私
- 不好笑

524
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,504
That's your trouble, Ems.
You're selfish. Not funny.

525
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,400
就告诉他是Albert干的 他会道歉 完了

526
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:05,556
Just tell him it was Albert.
He can apologise, end of.

527
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,700
- 为什么是我
- 那就Mickey
Oh, but why me? Oh, Mickey then.

528
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,400
不能告诉他是Mickey
因为他会跟Mickey没完没了
We won't tell him it was Mickey, cos
he'll make Mickey's life a misery.

529
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
- Albert 就说是Sean
- 慢着!
Hang on! Sean, you're the youngest.

530
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,900
Sean 这里你最小

531
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,000
如果你们告发我 我就拖你们俩下水
Well, if you grass me up,
I'm taking you all down with me.

532
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:21,528
Aren't we forgetting something here?
It is Eddie we're talking about.

533
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,500
我们是不是忘了什么了 
我们说的可是Eddie

534
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,800
Ash说得对 我是在让两个顶级骗子
Ash is right, I'm sending
two premier league grifters

535
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,000
对付一个酒保 大炮打蚊子

536
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,560
to deal with one barman,
it shouldn't be a contest.

537
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,800
- 不过他实在是倔
- 你会有办法的
He's really stubborn, though.
You'll think of something.

538
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,500
最好用黄铜

539
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:37,552
Brass may be your best bet.

540
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,600
不便宜 但熔化铸成砖后能以假乱真
It won't be cheap
but it will look the part

541
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,596
once it's melted down
and moulded into blocks.

542
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,700
开个价吧 Arnie
Well, give us a ball park, Arnie.

543
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,300
我能收回的话五千 否则一万
Five grand if I get it back,
ten if I don't. Done.

544
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,500
成交

545
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,300
好 那这个呢

546
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,508
OK. What about this?

547
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,400
- 你要怎样
- 改一个戳
What do you need?
A different seal on it.

548
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,200
那我得先熔掉它
Well, I'll have to melt it down
so I can stamp it.

549
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,500
你能办好吗
Can you do that?

550
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,000
只要是金属做的 Mickey 
我就能搞定
If it's made of metal, Mickey,
I can do anything.

551
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:08,588
ASH SNIGGERS

552
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,600
金属Mickey?
(也是米老鼠的全名)
Metal Mickey?

553
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,600
算了
Never mind.

554
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,900
- 你想印上什么
- 这个
What seal do you need on it?

555
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:19,524
This one.

556
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,100
八点半见
We'll see you at 8.30.

557
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,564
I don't believe you. It's true.
You wouldn't do that, Albert,

558
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,200
- 我不信
- 真的

559
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,400
不会是你干得 Albert 你是在保护某人
you're just protecting someone.
Eddie!

560
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,900
Eddie! 既然你不信
为什么让我们中的谁站出来道歉

561
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:42,512
Why ask one of us to apologise if,
when we do, you don't believe us?

562
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
- 你们只是把我当傻瓜
- 没有

563
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:44,572
You're just taking me for a mug.
No, we're not.

564
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
- 那你们叫来给我打电话的谁呢
- 谁
What about the fella
you got to phone up?

565
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,800
- 那个假装Ian Rush的家伙
- 他真的是Ian Rush
The one pretending to be Ian Rush?
No, it actually was Ian Rush.

566
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
又来了 拿我当白痴
You're doing it again, treating me
like an idiot. You're impossible!

567
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,100
Eddie 你真是不可理喻

568
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
- 你们继续禁止入内
- 我跟你上床能了结吗
And you're barred.
What if I slept with you?

569
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,900
- 不能
- 什么
No. What?!

570
00:24:56,568 --> 00:25:00,520
Sorry, I panicked just then,
I meant to say yeah. Eddie!

571
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
抱歉 刚刚吓到了 我想说可以的

572
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,600
Eddie!

573
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,400
听着 我知道是他干的 
在他亲自过来道歉

574
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,556
Listen, I know he did it
and until he comes here in person,

575
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,800
并在证人前承认
apologises and says in front
of witnesses that Liverpool FC

576
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,100
利物浦比西汉姆要强之前
你们都继续留在黑名单上
are better than West Ham,
then you're staying barred.

577
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,000
不可能 我是说 
不要脸 又不是我干的
It's not happening.
I mean, the flaming cheek of it,
and I never did it.

578
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,000
他认为是你干的 没办法说服他
He's convinced it was you and
there's no persuading him otherwise.
Come on, Ash, man up.

579
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,500
拜托 Ash 拿出点男子气概来
为大伙牺牲一下

580
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:20,568
Take one for the team.

581
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,100
不
No.

582
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
- 就花个20秒 能有多难
- 不是我干的
It takes 20 seconds,
how hard can it be? I ain't done it.

583
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,500
- 你俩一样倔
- 我什么也没干
You are as stubborn as each other.
I didn't do anything!

584
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,100
想想Eddie做的早餐

585
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:32,520
Think of Eddie's breakfast.
Yeah, he's finally got
his fried bread right.

586
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,600
他终于做对炸面包了

587
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,400
酥脆的外皮 湿润的内里
Crunchy crust,
a bit soggy in the middle.

588
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,500
不要
No.

589
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,500
我宁可挨饿

590
00:25:38,564 --> 00:25:40,544
I'd rather starve.

591
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,600
谢谢
Thanks.

592
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:57,524
His diary's full
but he's got a gap in ten minutes...

593
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,600
他行程排满了 
但十分钟后有个空...

594
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
好
Right.

595
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
- 早上好
- 准备好了?
Morning.

596
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:00,592
We set?

597
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,500
如果你弄丢了 就从你工资里扣
Yeah, if you lose it,
I'm stopping it out your wages.

598
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

599
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,200
你昨天把这个给了我朋友
You gave this to a friend of mine
yesterday.

600
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,300
* Oh it feels so good *
# Oh, it feels so good

601
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
* To have you by my side on a sunday morning *
# To have you by my side
on a Sunday morning

602
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,300
* Let's work together, baby *
# Let's work together, baby, yeah. #

603
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,800
* Yeah *

604
00:26:39,592 --> 00:26:44,520
Shania! Get yourself
a cup of tea, love.

605
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,700
Shania! 自个喝茶去 宝贝儿

606
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,508
You were kind enough
to give him a lift.

607
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,300
多谢你昨天载他一程

608
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
那您来这里有何贵干呢
So what's on your mind?

609
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
哦 我想你知道我来这的原因吧
Oh, I think you know why I'm here.

610
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:57,556
Why don't you spell it out for me?

611
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,900
你为何不亲口说出来呢

612
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,100
我手头有些货 想找个买家
We have some merchandise. We're
having trouble finding a buyer.

613
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,000
- 好吧 我听说了
- 即便如此 你也得出个体面的价格
Yeah, so I heard.
That doesn't mean you won't have
to pay a decent price.

614
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:09,508
You'll have to let the dog
see the rabbit first.

615
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,200
总得让我先见见货吧

616
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,300
利比亚?
Libyan? Problem?

617
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
- 有问题么
- 当然没有

618
00:27:30,544 --> 00:27:32,520
Not for me.

619
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,700
这么说你感兴趣 是吧

620
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,572
So you're interested, then?

621
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:38,524
It's what I do. I'm a middle man.

622
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,000
我就是干这行的 我是个中间人

623
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,500
我找到交易双方 
彼此有对方想要的东西
I find two parties, each wanting
something the other has,

624
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,900
却又联系不上...

625
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:46,516
and no way of coming together...

626
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,600
所以 实际上 我就是个提供便利的人
So, really, I'm a facilitator.

627
00:27:51,564 --> 00:27:54,580
The bottom line is, I can find a
buyer for that with one phone call.

628
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,800
但底线是 我一个电话就能找到买家

629
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,500
很好
Good. As long as you and your
boyfriend understand three things.

630
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,300
但是有三件事
你男朋友必须得明白

631
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,200
我猜他是你男朋友 没错吧

632
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,592
I'm assuming he is your boyfriend?

633
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:04,536
Yes, he is.

634
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,600
恩 没错

635
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,000
猜到了
That's what I thought.

636
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,568
Where was I? Three things?

637
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
- 说到哪儿了
- 三件事

638
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,800
首先 我不是个暴徒
Yeah, right. I'm not a mug,
apart from the Libyan stamp,

639
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,900
除了那个利比亚印章之外

640
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,700
昨天发生的事情告诉我
金条肯定有缺陷 还有...
all that drama yesterday tells me
it's obviously nicked, and, er...

641
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,700
<i>利比亚财产被盗</i>

642
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:24,588
I read the newspapers
like everybody else...

643
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,200
我也看了报纸...

644
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:26,544
I know where this has come from,

645
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,900
我知道金条从何而来 
所以价格嘛 也会有所反映

646
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:28,576
so the price I pay will have
to reflect that.

647
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,552
Second.

648
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,600
第二点

649
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,800
我会从你那收20%的中介费
My commission for negotiating this
deal is 20% at your end,

650
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,544
non-negotiable.

651
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,800
这点没得商量的

652
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,000
第三呢
And third?

653
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,100
要是你敢晃点我
If you so much as think
about turning me over,

654
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,500
我认识些人 他们会找到你 
让你受尽人间之苦
I know people who can track
you down and hurt you

655
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,540
so much you'll be begging them
to finish you off.

656
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,700
到时候 你会希望他们一枪结果了你

657
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,548
I'll pass it on.

658
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,700
我会传达的

659
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,200
我们商量好价格之后 
通知我那些金条的交易细节
Once we've agreed a price, just
let us know where they need to go.

660
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,400
你是说不止一块吗
You mean there's more than one?

661
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,700
是的
Yes.

662
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,800
那...到底有多少呢
So...
how many we talking about exactly?

663
00:29:04,548 --> 00:29:05,588
A hundred.

664
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,300
100个

665
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:10,552
A hundred! All the same as that one?

666
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,700
100个! 都跟这个一模一样的?

667
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,100
不少嘛
You mean you've got the whole lot?

668
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,596
You trying to tell me it was you...

669
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,700
- 如果你是想说...
- 这些对你来说太多了...

670
00:29:17,596 --> 00:29:20,516
If this is too big for you...

671
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,000
哪里...
Oh, no... It might take more than
one phone call that's all...

672
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
只是不止要一个电话了嘛...

673
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,000
我能验验货吗

674
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,552
Can I see them? I don't know.

675
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,900
不知道

676
00:29:28,552 --> 00:29:33,504
My contacts don't like being
pissed about. If I don't see the
goods, I don't pick up the phone.

677
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,000
我的客户可不想被爽约

678
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,300
所以如果我不见货 
我是不会打电话的

679
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,300
你决定吧

680
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:36,572
It's your choice.

681
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,900
就在我朋友昨天下车的地方
The place where you
dropped our mutual friend,

682
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,700
今天下午两点
two o'clock this afternoon.

683
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,900
额滴神
Holy shit.

684
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,800
上钩了
I think we have a nibble.

685
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,000
Shania

686
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:02,520
Shania!

687
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,400
给Heinz Zimmerman拨电话
Get Heinz Zimmerman on the phone.
Then put the kettle on.

688
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,300
然后把水烧上

689
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,900
经得住吗
Will it stand up?

690
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
- 经得住什么
- 验货
To what?

691
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,800
- 没问题
- 那就好
Inspection. 100%. Good.

692
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,200
只要在6尺开外

693
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:22,532
As long as you don't get
within six feet.

694
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,500
这可不是小钱 Heinz 
我们说的可是100公斤的24K纯金啊
This aint chicken feed, Heinz,

695
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,584
we're talking 100 kilos of 24 carat,
this is a serious shipment.

696
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,800
- 这可不是开玩笑的
- 什么时候能准备好

697
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:30,516
When's it ready?

698
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,200
我们要先把它熔了 
重新盖印章 但我能...

699
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:33,564
Well, we'll need to melt it down
and restamp, but I can...

700
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,588
I can do the paperwork...
the question is can you handle it?

701
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,600
手续的问题就交给我了
但问题是你能吃进吗

702
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,000
你别光说不练呢
You talk the talk buddy,
it's time to walk the walk.

703
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,600
值三百万呢 干还是不干
There's three mill's worth here,
are you in or are you out?

704
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,200
好吧 我要了
'OK we have a deal, I'll be there.'

705
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,300
好咧 保持联系
Good call, be in touch.

706
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,000
* Yo mic check mic check *
# Yo, mic check, mic check

707
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:55,524
# Yeah here you go
Nah, here, over here

708
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,200
* Yeah here you go nah here over here *

709
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,800
* Yeah I heard he got that hot new thing *
# Yeah, I heard he got
that hot new thing

710
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,500
* Oh la la la yeah oh yeah yeah turn it over *
# Oh-la-la-la. Yeah oh, yeah, yeah
Turn it over. #

711
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,900
嗨 宝贝儿

712
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,400
别动 不然我打爆你的头 听到了吗
All right, babes?

713
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:17,532
Don't move or I'm gonna blow
your brains out, do you hear me?

714
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,000
伦敦又不是只有Eddie这一个酒吧
Eddie's isn't the only bar
in London.

715
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,700
或许我们就换一家好了
Maybe we should just find
somewhere else?

716
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,300
不不 我们会有办法解决的
No, no, we'll find a way to sort it.

717
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,700
抱歉 但是我们不能暴露地点
Sorry about that,
but we can't disclose our location.

718
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,200
英国军方派了一个特遣队抓我们

719
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:05,508
The British army have sent
a special ops unit to find us.

720
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
那是当然
Oh, well, fair enough then!

721
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,200
别介意 他对谁都不放心
Oh, don't mind him.
He's just not the trusting type.

722
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:19,552
You all right then?

723
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,800
你还好吧

724
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,588
So, you think you can get us a deal?

725
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,000
你真能帮我们做成这笔买卖吗

726
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,900
当然啦 但也不容易
我之前跟你女友说啦
Yes, I do.

727
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,560
But it won't be easy,
as I told your lady friend here.

728
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,500
- 多少钱
- 很难说
How much? Well, that's hard to say.

729
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,700
- 我跟你说什么来着
- 放松

730
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:34,544
What was I telling you? Relax.

731
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,528
There's 100 bars.

732
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,900
总共有100个

733
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,400
我查了下 每个价值3万
I looked it up, they're worth
about 30 grand each.

734
00:32:40,576 --> 00:32:43,584
If you buy 'em from
the Bank of England, yeah, maybe...

735
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,000
如果你从英格兰银行买的话 是没错...

736
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:46,524
But you won't get anything near
that, not for a shipment like this.

737
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,800
可你想这么来可拿不到半毛钱 
尤其是这种货

738
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,900
没有法律文件 金条就动不了 你得...
You can't move gold on without
paperwork. You need to, er,

739
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,100
先把它熔了 换个身份 再进入市场
melt it down, give it
a new identity, feed it back
into the system.

740
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,100
这都要花时间 还有钱
That takes time and money.

741
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,300
你想说这不容易是吗
You talking to us
about it not being easy?

742
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,100
三个月前 在利比亚 
我们刚完一次作战任务
Three months ago, we'd just done
a black ops stint in Libya,

743
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,000
躲着美国佬的巡航导弹 
还有阿帕奇武装直升机
dodging yank cruise missiles
and Apache gun ships,

744
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,544
smuggling rebel supporters out of
Tripoli before Gaddafi got to them.

745
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,600
在卡扎菲找到叛军之前 
把他们偷送出的黎波里

746
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,700
卡扎菲让自己的秘密警察
Gaddafi got his secret police
to move his stash of goodies

747
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,300
在叛军到来之前 把东西都运走了
before the rebels arrived.

748
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,200
艺术品 现金 还有金子
Artwork, cash... Gold.

749
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,400
他死之后 我们在出的黎波里的路上
截获了运金条的车
He died, we caught the gold truck
on the road out of Tripoli.

750
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,200
我们把它洗劫一空
And we...relieved them of it.

751
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,100
现在 我们拼死跨越大半个非洲
Now we have not fought our way
across half of Africa,

752
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:35,544
carrying 100 kilos in gold bars and
then smuggled them into the UK,

753
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,200
把100公斤金条偷运进英国

754
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,000
不是为了让你个一脸贱样的
平民渣子给痛宰的
just so some smarmy scumbag civilian
can try to rip us off.

755
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:40,552
do you get me?

756
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,600
- 听明白了吗
- 退后 下士 

757
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,572
Back off, Corporal.

758
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,524
HE LAUGHS

759
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,400
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

760
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:50,504
HE CONTINUES LAUGHING

761
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
到底多少
How much?

762
00:33:54,588 --> 00:34:00,500
I can get you half a million,
transferred into any account,
anywhere in the world in 20 seconds.

763
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,500
50万 转至任意账户

764
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,900
世界各地 20秒之内到帐

765
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,700
我情愿一枪毙了他

766
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,500
I'd rather shoot him where he
stands. You want to spend another
two weeks in here!?

767
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,700
你还想在这里再呆两周吗

768
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,500
我们已经被骗了两次了
We've been screwed over twice now.

769
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,000
这个价可不低了 我保证
You won't get a better price,
I guarantee it. He's playing us.

770
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,700
他耍我们呢

771
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,100
50万英镑可不是个小数目
Half a million pounds
is a lot of money.

772
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,900
50万不包括佣金怎样
What about half a million,
but no commission?

773
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,100
你转手时想赚多少随你便
Yeah? I say we negotiate.

774
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,100
- 佣金没得商量
- 是吗 我就要商量

775
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,900
好吧
All right! OK!

776
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:30,540
Forget the commission. Heart of
gold, that's my trouble. When?

777
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,600
那就不算佣金了 谁让我这么善良呢

778
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,700
时间呢

779
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:39,588
I need to verify the shipment first.

780
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
我得先验下货

781
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,600
要拿块样品 测纯度
I mean a sample, check the purity.

782
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:13,500
What else?

783
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,300
还有呢

784
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
如果一切顺利 24小时内就能搞定 
Well, if it all checks out, I can
get this done in 24 hours.
Bish bosh!

785
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,100
就给你24个小时
24 hours.

786
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,000
- 怎么样
- 我滴妈 老板
Well?

787
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:51,524
Bloody hell, boss.

788
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,100
- 绝对极品 24K的
- 还有呢
It's top end, 24 carat. And?

789
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,200
是利比亚政府的印章 如假包换
Well, it's Libyan government seal,
it's about as kosher as it gets.

790
00:35:57,592 --> 00:35:59,596
What's it worth?

791
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,500
价值多少

792
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
金价早上又涨了点 所以...
Gold price this morning was up a
bit, so... Just about 拢33,500?

793
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
大概是33,500

794
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:08,544
So 100 bars...?

795
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,900
那100个...

796
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,100
330万 不算零头
Three million,
three hundred thousand, and change.

797
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,592
Hmm.

798
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,700
吃滴来了
Grub's up. Great!

799
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,500
太好了

800
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,400
刚刚来电话 明天一切就绪
The mark just called, everything's
set up for tomorrow. We're just
running through a few things.

801
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,500
有几件事我们还得再商量一下

802
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,000
- 好的 Albert的两份鳕鱼 
- 谢谢

803
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:38,556
Oh, right. Er, two cod, Albert.
Thank you. And one for Mickey.

804
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,500
Mickey一份

805
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,100
我的派 Ems的黑线鳕
Pie for me, haddock for Ems...

806
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:46,532
..And a saveloy for Sean. Saveloy!

807
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,300
还有Sean的五香辣味腊肠

808
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,600
五香辣味腊肠!

809
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,700
- 他啥时打的电话
- 大概20分钟以前
So, when did he phone?

810
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:49,596
About 20 minutes ago.

811
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:52,532
It'll be a pleasure to
take his money.

812
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,500
拿他钱真让我开心

813
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,000
如果成功的话 
Albert想拿一份给Vivienne
If this works, Albert was thinking
of giving some money to Vivienne,

814
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,900
让她去坐个游轮什么的
you know, maybe send her on a cruise
or something. Great idea.

815
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,500
好主意

816
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
别忘了 Eddie的事还没解决呢
Don't forget, we've still got to
sort Eddie out as well. Yes, we do.

817
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
可不是嘛

818
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,600
我先申明 我可不会为
莫须有的事情道歉
I'm not apologising for something
I didn't do.

819
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,900
当然不用 没人让你去
No, of course not, no-one would
expect you to. Sean had an idea.

820
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,600
Sean有个主意

821
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:12,528
Mm, I mean, he wouldn't believe me
that it was Albert,

822
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,700
他不相信是Albert做的

823
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,600
但我想 如果我再努努力 
能让他相信是我干的
but I reckon, if I try hard enough,
I can convince him it was me.

824
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:17,512
What, you'd hold your hand up?

825
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,500
咋 你要认错了吗

826
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,300
是啊 如果只有这个办法 我万死不辞啦
Yeah, if that's what it takes to fix
it then that's what I have to do.

827
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
说得好 Sean
Well, I think that's brilliant,
Sean.

828
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,200
嗯嗯
Yeah. Yeah, it is. Only thing is,
I'm not sure what to say to him.

829
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,000
唯一的问题是 我不知该跟他说什么好

830
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,800
- 就说你很抱歉在他的照片上乱画
- 这样就行
Just say sorry for scribbling
on his photo. Yeah, fine.

831
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,200
不不不 这可不够 
那可是Ian Rush啊
No, no, no, no, it was more
than that, it was Ian Rush.

832
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,700
对利物浦球迷来说 
他就是足球皇室成员
He's football royalty for Scousers.
No, you've got to say something
like, erm...

833
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,500
你应该说...

834
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
很抱歉弄脏了有史以来
最伟大足球运动员的照片
I'm sorry for defacing the
photograph of the greatest
footballer who ever lived.

835
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,500
有点过啊
Sounds a bit over the top.

836
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
跟你说 他高兴还来不及呢
Yeah, well he's obsessed,
I'm telling you.

837
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,000
其他的呢

838
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,500
What about the other thing, though?
That he wants us to say that
Liverpool is better than West Ham?

839
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,700
他想让我们承认利物浦
比西汉姆好怎么办

840
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,800
不会的啦 那只是针对Ash

841
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,572
No, no, that was just for Ash.

842
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,588
I don't even support West Ham.

843
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,200
我又没支持西汉姆 他们都被降级了
625 

844
00:37:55,588 --> 00:38:00,568
They were relegated! Oi, they
weren't relegated in that way.

845
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,500
喂 他们可不是因为不行被降级的

846
00:38:00,568 --> 00:38:05,512
So how many ways are there?
That's what a lot of people think,
you see, that West Ham went down

847
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
还有其他原因吗

848
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,000
人们普遍认为西汉姆落寞

849
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,700
因为他们水平不行了 
但这不是真的

850
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:07,564
because they weren't any good,
but that's not true.

851
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,000
他们在英冠联只是休息一下

852
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,544
No, no, we just went in the
Championship for a rest, right?

853
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,600
在进军下届英超前 养精蓄锐
To take a break before we launched
our next assault on the Premiership.

854
00:38:15,564 --> 00:38:19,564
So should I say it or not?
Well, Eddie is stubborn remember.

855
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,800
- 那我到底说不说
- 别忘了Eddie可是个老顽固

856
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,800
你就说利物浦队是世界上最好的球队
Just tell him that Liverpool are the
greatest team on the planet. Yes,
he would definitely go for that.

857
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,400
对 他绝对开心

858
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,500
等他开心了 跟你握手的时候 
再说Ash给他一个口信
And when he's gone for that and
shaken hands, give him a message
from Ash. Yeah? What's that?

859
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,300
是哦 什么口信

860
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,300
告诉他利物浦队的都是一群娘们 
西汉姆才是欧洲第一的
Liverpool play like girls and
West Ham are the only proper team
in Europe. That's not going to help.

861
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,900
- 那可帮不上忙
- 但事实如此

862
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:36,556
It is true, honestly.

863
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,400
好吧...
All right... Sean, it is
very kind of you to do this,

864
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,300
Sean 谢谢你自告奋勇 我们继续吧

865
00:38:41,508 --> 00:38:43,504
but let's move on.

866
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,600
明天9点 Emma去敲定细节

867
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:47,580
Tomorrow, at nine, Emma sets up
the mark. Ash, make sure the bars
are in place.

868
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,800
Ash 你确保金条就位

869
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,000
还有 记住 我们要让他确信
And remember, we need to make sure
this guy believes that this is just
a deal that's gone wrong,

870
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,500
是交易遇到了麻烦 而不是骗局

871
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:54,572
not that he's been conned. OK?

872
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,200
Albert和我会想办法来个干净的收尾
So Albert and I will work out
a way of blowing him out clean.

873
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,700
车上见 不见不散
Meet you at my car.
I'll see you there.

874
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:35,516
You all right?

875
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,200
你还好吧

876
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:42,592
Well?

877
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,300
怎么说

878
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,000
货验好了吧
I assume it all checked out.

879
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,700
好货
Good as gold.

880
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,568
So we have a deal?

881
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,900
- 可以交易了吧
- 何时何地

882
00:39:49,568 --> 00:39:51,548
When and where?

883
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,100
和上次一样 高速公路下
Under the motorway,
same as last time.

884
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,100
一小时以后
One hour.

885
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
- 你最后快点联系买家
- 好的
You'd better get on to your buyer.
All right.

886
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,000
Shania
Shania!

887
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,500

Get Heinz on the phone. Now!

888
00:40:11,572 --> 00:40:13,532
PHONE RINGS

889
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,200
Heinz 好消息 我们敲定了
Heinz! Happy days, we're on.

890

Barry will bring you to the meeting
point, stick behind us in my car.

You ready? Oh, yeah.
Well, let's get on with it then.

895
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,600
那就开始吧

896
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,500
除非你想让一个50人的特遣队
跑来毁了我们的派对
Unless you want a 50-strong
special ops unit dropping in
to spoil the party.

897
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,528
He's setting us up!

898
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,000
我们中计了

899
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,600
没事 没事 他们是跟我一起的
Whoa! Whoa! No! No, they're with me!

900
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:09,540
No! It's all right! It's all good!

901
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,000
没事的

902
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,500
一切正常 他们跟我一起的
It's good as gold. No, see,
they're with me.

903
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,100
他是我跟班 Barry 他把买家带来了
That's my lad, Barry.

904
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,592
He's brought my buyer. See,
I'm the middle man, he's the buyer.

905
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,800
我是中间人 他是买家

906
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,100
他付我钱 我再付给你 
是这样的 对吧

907
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,548
He pays me, I pay you,
that's how it works. OK?

908
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,100
- 你想怎么样
- 验货
What do you need? See the gold.

909
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,800
额 我们得验下货
Er, we need to see the goods.

910
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:37,520
Sir?

911
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
长官

912
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,100
你一定会喜欢的 Heinz
You'll like this, Heinz.

913
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,000
我验过样品了
I verified the gold.

914
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:01,528
See? Everyone's happy!

915
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,300

916
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,400
没事的 做生意嘛 就这样
It's all good.

917
00:42:04,508 --> 00:42:06,580
it's just business, that's all.

918
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,000
站住 你退下 叫他退下
Freeze! Yo, back up!
Tell him to back up!

919
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,400
好好好 我现在转账给你
It's OK! I'm going to pay you now.

920
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,100
好吧

921
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,516
HE CHUCKLES

922
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:06,520
RUMBLING SOUND

923
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:34,556
They're on to us!

924
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,800
他们是来抓我们的

925
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,600
你丫差点害我们被宰了
You nearly got us bloody killed.

926
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,300
希望下次交易不会那么戏剧化

927
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,516
I hope our next delivery
is not quite so eventful.

928
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,500
是啊 很抱歉 Heinz
但我们都没事 对吧

929
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:09,532
Yeah, sorry about that, Heinz.
But all's well and all that, yeah?

930
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,100
再接再励哈
Chin up!

931
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,524
Auf wiedersehen!

932
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,000

Sorry, sir. Closed.

00:44:32,596 --> 00:44:36,504
What do you mean it's closed?
It's one o'clock!

938
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,800
关门是什么意思 现在才一点

939
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,400
我要兑现汇票

940
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:41,520
I've got a bankers' draft to cash.
The bank ceased trading at 11.30
this morning, sir. What!?

941
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,000
银行今早11:30就停止交易了 先生

942
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
- 什么
- 具体的我不清楚 先生

943
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,500
I'm not sure of the details, sir,
but the bank's assets have been
seized and all trading suspended.

944
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,600
但银行的资产被扣押了 
所有交易暂停

945
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,800
可是... 可是... 我有...
我有一张银行汇票要兑

I've got a bankers draft!

948
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,100

the archery, he was hacked off - he
didn't know they did archery there.

954
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,100
他很不爽 不知道他们有在那训练

955
00:45:20,568 --> 00:45:24,568
He said it would've been all right,
though. Excuse me for just a moment.

956
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,500

I knew you were good
but getting the army onside?

How did that work?

994

Can I ask why you're selling?

995
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,700
能问下你干吗要卖了这里呢

996

There's an army base
half a mile away,

997

半里外有个军队基地

998
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,700
他们本该在下一块地演练的
they're meant to do their manoeuvres
in the next field.

999
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,200

But they keep getting lost

So what, you apologised, bigged up
Liverpool and he swallowed it?

1028
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,900
没错
Yeah.

1029
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,600
他没提到我名字吗
He didn't mention my name?

1030
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,576
Let's just say it's forgotten.

1031
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,200
已经成为过去式了

1032
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,700

Just like that?

1033
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,400
我当然得施展魅力 说服他
但他人很好

1034
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,524
I had to use charm, talk him round.
But yeah, he's sweet.

So we can go back in?

1043
00:49:08,552 --> 00:49:11,520
It was Ash. Knew it!

00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,300
- 是Ash干的
- 我就知道

1045
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,552
So where is he then?

1046
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,300

1048
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,700
- 我要他道歉
- 他也想道歉的
I want an apology.
And he wants to apologise.

1049
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,100
他只是不能鼓起勇气当面跟你道歉
He just can't bring himself
to do it face-to-face.

1050
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,500
所以他给了我这个
So he gave me this.

1051
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,600
Ash的口信
'A message from Ash.

1052

1055
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,800
伙计们 很多人认为西汉姆联队没落

1056
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,552
Many people think West Ham went down
cos they weren't any good
but that's not true.

1057
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,400
是因为他们水平不行
事实上不是的

1058
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,600
绝对不是 我们只是想
在英冠联休息一下
No, no. We just went into
the Championship for a rest, right,

1059
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,000
可以冲击下一届英超
to take a break before we launched
our next assault on the Premiership.

1060
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,700
那我到底该不该说呢
So should I say it or not?

1061
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,600
告诉他利物浦队是世界上最好的球队

1062
00:49:56,504 --> 00:49:58,560
Tell him Liverpool
are the best team on the planet.

1063
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,100
这句话他肯定受用
He would definitely go for that.

1064
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,300
当他软化时 跟他握手 告诉他
After that and you've shaken hands,
give him a message.

1065
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,400
啊 说什么
Yeah? What's that?

1066
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,100
利物浦就像一群娘们在踢球
西汉姆联队是欧洲唯一好的球队
Liverpool play like girls
and West Ham are the only
proper team in Europe.

1067
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,100
利物浦是欧洲唯一好的球队
'Liverpool are the only proper team
in Europe.'

1068
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:16,556
(Brilliant!)

1069
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,200
老实说 西汉姆联队衰落就是实力不好
'Let's be honest. West Ham went down
because they weren't good enough.

1070
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,400
利物浦是世界上最好的球队
'Liverpool are the best team
on the planet.

1071
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,400
西汉姆联队就像是一群娘们在踢球
利物浦是欧洲唯一一支好的球队
'West Ham play like a load of girls

1072
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:27,524
'and Liverpool are the only
proper team in Europe.'

1073
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,700
没事了吧
So we're good?

1074
00:50:29,556 --> 00:50:31,508
Come here.

1075
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,500
过来

1076
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,900
我基本按照你教的说来着
I pretty much told him
exactly what you told me to.

1077
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,900
可能没有字字精确 但你知道的

1078
00:50:36,508 --> 00:50:39,548
I mean, I might not have got it
word for word, but you know.

1079
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,200
- 主要意思都说清了吧
- 哦 当然 当然
But you gave him the gist?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1080
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,200
那是位快乐的女士

1081
00:50:45,536 --> 00:50:46,588
That is a very happy lady.

1082
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,524
So what did you tell her?

1083
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,300
你跟她说了什么

1084
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,500
我告诉他我是监察专员
她能得到损害赔偿金了
I told her I was an ombudsman
and she'd just been awarded damages.

1085
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,500
做得好
A very sweet thing for you to do.

1086
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,800
- 也多亏了你们的帮助
- 随时
Well, thank you all for your help.
Any time.

1087
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,500

Yeah, Sean did the business.

1089
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,500
既然这样 那我们还等什么
Well, what are we waiting for?

1090
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,200
伙计们 很高兴见到你们 快进来吧
Guys! Good to see you, come on in.

1091
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,700
- 那我们没事吧 恩
- 一笔勾销了 无需多说
So we're OK? Eh?

1092
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,584
All forgotten, not another word.

1093
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:17,560
Bottle of bubbly on ice,
waiting for you. On the house.

1094
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,700
一瓶冰镇香槟在等了 我请 

1095
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,100
- 谢谢 Eddie
- 耶 Eddie
Thank you, Eddie!

1096
00:51:18,596 --> 00:51:20,528
Cheers, Eddie. It's OK.

1097
00:51:21,572 --> 00:51:22,576
Oh.

1098
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,400
哦

1099
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,200
还好吧 Ed
All right, Ed?

1100
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:33,508
You're a top man, Ash,
you know that?

1101
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,300
你很棒 Ash 你知道吗

1102
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,500
承认错误不容易的
It's not easy
admitting you're wrong.

1103
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,900
不 不 你过奖了
No, no, it can't have been.

1104
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,100
- 要极具勇气才能迈出这么一步
- 是的 没错
Takes a big man to step up
to the plate. Yes, it does.

1105
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,584
Any chance of you letting go now?

1106
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,300
- 你能让我走了吗
- 抱歉

1107
00:51:46,584 --> 00:51:48,544
Sorry.

1108
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,400
听着 我知道你不喜欢我小题大做
但我想让你知道...
Look, I know
you don't like any fuss

1109
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,584
but I just want you to know, that...

1110
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,800
作为一个男人...我敬重你
I respect you...as a man.

1111
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,900
作为个男人 我也敬重你 Ed
And I respect you too, Ed.

1112
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,516
As a man.

1113
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,700
我知道的 我知道的

1114
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:04,524
I know you do. I know you do.

1115
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,000
就这样 都成过眼云烟了 无须多言
So that's it then, yeah, water under
the bridge, not another word? Right.

1116
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,300
没错

1117
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,800
没错
Right.

1118
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,100
- 好了 我们能开酒了吗 
- 可以 可以
Right, shall we open the bottle, or?

1119
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:17,552
Yes, yes.

1120
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,508
MICKEY LAUGHS
OK, now.

1121
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,400
好了

1122
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,200
这...献给我们金灿灿的未来
This...is to a golden future.

1123
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
没想到会再见到我吧
Bet you never thought
you'd see me again.

1124
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,800
退下 下士
Back off, corporal.

1125
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,400
是的 没想到
No, we didn't.

1126
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,200
你带我去仓库时 
我听到了你们的对话 

1127
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,544
Only when you were taking me
into the barn, I heard you talking.

1128
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,600
Eddie又不是伦敦唯一一家酒吧
Eddie's isn't the only bar
in London.

1129
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,000
或许我们能另找个地方

1130
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:49,584
Maybe we should just find
somewhere else.

1131
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,500
不 不 总有办法的

1132
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,576
No, no,
we'll find a way to sort it.

1133
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,200
希望渺茫 但...
It was a bit of a long shot, but...

1134
00:52:56,584 --> 00:53:00,504
Tell you the truth, I thought
you'd be long gone by now.

1135
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,400
不得不说 我以为
你们可能已经消失了

1136
00:53:01,576 --> 00:53:03,528
The thing is...

1137
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,900
问题是...

1138
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,800
那五十万磅把我给毁了
有人要付出代价
..that half a million quid broke me
and someone's got to pay.

1139
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,600
你想怎样
So...what do you have in mind?

1140
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,100
别急

1141
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,560
ASH: Relax.

1142
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,400
听着 我没想找你们晦气
Look, I haven't got any beef
with you guys.

1143
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,300
- 什么- 你们拿了我的钱 
那是生意 我能理解
Sorry?

1144
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,540
OK, you got my money, but that was
business. I understand that.

1145
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,584
I got the gold,
I gave it to Heinz, I took a hit.

1146
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,100
我拿到金块 转卖给Heinz 赚个差价

1147
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,000
你们得到应得的 我毫无怨言
You kept to your end of the bargain,
I've got no complaints about that.

1148
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,100
但那德国佬骗了我
But that Kraut cheated me!

1149
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,300
他拿走了金砖 给我不能用的支票
现在我找不到他了
He took my gold and he gave me a
dodgy cheque, now I can't find him.

1150
00:53:47,552 --> 00:53:49,584
His office number's unavailable

1151
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,300
他办公室电话打不通
手机又被某个疯子偷了

1152
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,592
and some nutcase
has nicked his mobile.

1153
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,900
这有五千
50 grand.

1154
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,504
Now, I know you lot
were Black Ops in the army,

1155
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,600
我知道你们有军事背景

1156
00:54:09,504 --> 00:54:12,524
so I thought who better
to help me out.

1157
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,600
所以我想找你们帮忙

1158
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,500
- 黑色行动
- 没关系 我知道你们不能声张
Black Ops?

1159
00:54:14,532 --> 00:54:17,552
It's OK.
I know you can't talk about it.

1160
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,300
但我懂的
But I know how it works.

1161
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,900
我知道你们做什么的
I know what you do.

1162
00:54:22,548 --> 00:54:23,592
What's that, then?

1163
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,300
那是什么呢

1164
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,200
你们深入敌后 先发制人
You get dropped behind enemy lines
to take people out.

1165
00:54:28,592 --> 00:54:32,584
Well, that's what I want you to do
to the German.

1166
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,600
我也正想要你们这么对付那德国佬

1167
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,700
把他挖出来
I want you to track him down for me.

1168
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:37,500
His name is Heinz Zimmerman.

1169
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,300
他叫Heinz Zimmerman

1170
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,200
找到他 然后帮我好好照料他
I want you to find him,

1171
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,532
and I want you to...
take care of him for me.

1172
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,100
- "好好照料他"
- 你们懂的
"Take care of him?"
You know what I mean.

1173
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,500
噢 对 好好照料他
Oh, yeah. Take care of him.

1174
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:51,300
这一共五万磅 
把他带给我后再给五万磅
There's 50 grand there,
there'll be the same again

1175
00:54:49,572 --> 00:54:51,536
when you bring him to me.

1176
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,600
或给我看...
他死后冰冷尸体的照片
Or show me a photo...
of his cold, dead body.

1177
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,600
做不做
Do we have a deal?

1178
00:55:07,524 --> 00:55:09,548
Let me get this straight.

1179
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,000
让我把话说白了

1180
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,200
是不是我们找到Heinz Zimmerman
解决掉他
If we find this Heinz Zimmerman,
take care of him,

1181
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,600
给出照片证明 你会再给我们五万
and show you a photo of that,
you'll give us another 50 thousand?

1182
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,900
没错
That's right.

1183
00:55:29,572 --> 00:55:31,552
Then you've got a deal.

1184
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,800
成交

1185
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,400
你知道怎么联系我的
You know where to find me.

1186
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,300
这不是真的吧
Did that just happen?

1187
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,100
- 没错 是真的
- 刚我还以为我们有麻烦了
Yes, it did. I thought we were
in trouble for a minute.

1188
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,500
不用担心 我搞定
Not to worry, I'm on it.

1189
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:13,596
Wait a minute.

1190
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,300
等等

1191
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,300
呃 一定要在衬衫上撒番茄酱吗
Ugh, did you have to put ketchup
on this shirt?

1192
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:22,528
With five grand, you can buy a new
shirt. You have to look the part.

1193
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,800
五千磅可以买件新的了

1194
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,300
你总得看着像回事啊

1195
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,400
就是装死
Or dead to be precise.

1196
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,400
知道 不 抓那里 抓那儿

1197
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,520
OK, now, that. No.
Hold that, hold that.

1198
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,500
太好了
That's fantastic.

1199
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:31,560
I really missed you lot, you know.

1200
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,700
我想死你们了 知道吗

1201
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,700
是吗 我们也很想你 Ed
Yeah, well, we missed you too, Ed.

1202
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,200
- 真的吗
- 是啊 别再抱我了
Did you?
Yeah. Just don't hug me again.

1203
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,900
为西汉姆联队干杯
Here's to West Ham.

1204
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,300
哦 干杯
Oh, cheers.

1205
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:48,544
Hang on a minute, you're supposed
to say, "Here's to Liverpool."

1206
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,800
等等 你应该说 "为利物浦队干杯"

1207
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:50,900
为什么
What for?

1208
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,300
噢 这太不对了吧 
Well, that's not very nice, is it?

1209
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,100
你继续这样 那道歉还有什么意义

1210
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,516
What's the point in apologising
if you behave like that?

1211
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,200
但道歉的是Sean 我没有啊
But Sean apologised, I didn't.

1212
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,500
- 有 你有
- 不 我什么也没干
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't do anything.

1213
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,200
那张CD呢

1214
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,504
What about the CD?

1215
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,500
什么CD
What CD?

1216
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,200
Ash的口信
'Message from Ash.

1217
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,200
很抱歉我损坏了有史以来
最伟大球员的照片
'I'm sorry for defacing
the photograph

1218
00:57:13,536 --> 00:57:16,560
'of the greatest footballer
who ever lived. Ian Rush.'

1219
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,500
Ian Rush

1220
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Ash...这我可以解释
Ash...

1221
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:19,524
This...

1222
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:21,532
this can be easily explained.

1223
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,000
收一份钱 杀两个人怎样
How about two dead bodies
for the price of one.

1224
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,800
不过一个是真死...

1225
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,576
Only one of 'em will be real...

1226
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,300
因为我要杀了你
..cos I'm going to kill you.

1227
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,600
- Ash
- Sean 赶紧跑
Ash. Sean, just run.

1228
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,000
别傻站了 快帮我
Don't just stand there! Help me!

1229
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,600
Ash 别逼我做后悔的事
Ash, don't make me do something
I'm going to regret!

1230
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,560
Argh!

1231
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,300
太紧了 太紧了 Ash
That's pretty tight.
That's pretty tight! Ash!
