1
00:00:02,647 --> 00:00:03,980
- 你错了  - 我没错
- You're wrong.  - No, I'm not.

2
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:06,382
- 你就是错了  - 我没错
- Yes, you are.  - No, I'm not.

3
00:00:06,384 --> 00:00:08,384
你来说 那种互联网上
Settle this. Those little animated pictures

4
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:11,020
会动的小图片 是叫"动图"还是"闪图"?
on the Internet, are they called "gifs" or "jifs"?

5
00:00:11,022 --> 00:00:12,622
这里应该指的是"会动的"
Well, the G stands for "graphics."

6
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:14,524
根据意思 我说该是"动图"
That's a hard G, so I'd say "gif."

7
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:17,460
什么... 发明的那家伙说是"闪图"
W... The guy who invented it says it's "jif."

8
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:21,130
不好意思 你说的是家伙还是夹伙?
I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,234
允许你们猜三次
Well, I'll give you three guesses

10
00:00:24,236 --> 00:00:26,236
我干嘛这么生气
why I'm so irritated.

11
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:29,973
有事情违背了你的预想
Something happened different from the way you wanted it.

12
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,942
坏事还真是传千里
I guess news travels fast.

13
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:35,745
猜对了 他们选择邀请了
It's true, a select group of scientists

14
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:37,413
一批科学家去理查德·费曼故居
was invited to a weekend symposium

15
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:39,382
参加周末学术讨论会
at a former home of Richard Feynman,

16
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:41,017
我没被邀请
and I wasn't included.

17
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:43,586
Sheldon 我觉得这肯定不是因为他们认为
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because they don't think

18
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:45,455
- 你不是出色的科学家  - 没错
- you're an elite scientist.  - Yeah,

19
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:49,025
肯定是因为你太让人蛋疼了
I bet you anything it's just 'cause you're a pain in the ass.

20
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:52,328
你就别安慰我了
You're just saying that to make me feel better.

21
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:55,198
听着 你可以花一整天
Look, you can spend the rest of the day

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,967
- 不爽这件事  - 同意
- being bitter about this.  - Agreed.

23
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,037
我本来还想说"或者"的 还是算了吧
I was gonna say "or," but why bother?

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,674
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

25
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:08,011
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

26
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:09,646
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

27
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:12,181
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

28
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:14,851
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

29
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:17,520
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

30
00:01:17,522 --> 00:01:19,422
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

31
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:21,391

嘿 我给你买了份小礼物
Hey, I got you a little gift.

37
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:37,159
好多女童子军曲奇哦
Oh, that's a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.

38
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:39,027
你懂的 我是印度人
You know me. I'm from India.

39
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:41,196
小孩一求我 我就受不了
I can't resist children begging.

40
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,733
房子过户的事办得怎么样了?
So, how's it going with the title to the house?

41
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:45,667
很好 都搞定了
Great, it's all done.

42
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:46,735
律师找到了我爸爸
The lawyer tracked down my father

43
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:48,237
让他签了过户文件
and got him to sign it over.

44
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,938
我不必见他 不用和他说话
I didn't have to meet him, I didn't have to talk to him,

45
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,573
都不用知道他人在哪里
I don't even know where he is.

46
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:54,576
哇哦 你完全不好奇吗?
Wow, so you're not curious at all?

47
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:55,677
不
Nope.

48
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,279
万一他在监狱里呢?
Hm. What if he's in prison?

49
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:59,047
万一他是个间谍呢?
What if he's a spy?

50
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:01,884
万一他是披头士翻唱乐队的呢?
What if he's in a Beatles cover band?

51
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:05,220
你看 如果他的鼻子和发型和你一样
I'm just saying, if he's got your nose and haircut,

52
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:07,389
就绝对是个翻版林戈
he'd make a killer Ringo.

53
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:07,389
{\an8}林戈·斯塔尔 英国摇滚乐队"披头士"的鼓手

54
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,460
谢谢你愿意参与录制
Thanks again for agreeing to do this.

55
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:13,929
不客气 我从没上过播客
Oh, it's cool. I've never been on a podcast before.

56
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,898
那你选了个不错的开端
Well, you picked a good one to start.

57
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,165
Wil的播客上过很多大牌嘉宾
Wil's had lots of great guests.

58
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,834
乔纳森·弗雷克斯 布伦特·斯派尔
Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner,

59
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:21,303
米切尔·道恩 盖茨·迈克范登...
Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden...

60
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:23,338
那些都是演星际迷航的演员
Those are Star Trek people.

61
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,439
没错!
Yes!

62
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:25,507
我能猜对
I only figured that out

63
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,209
是因为我一个都没听说过
because I've never heard of any of them.

64
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,611
是我活该
I deserve that.

65
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:32,681
我请你上我的节目 还自己开车过来
I invited you on my show and I drove here.

66
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:33,849
抱歉
Sorry.

67
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,384
好 这基本上就是
Okay, so, this is basically gonna be

68
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,785
一个小型脱口秀
just like a little talk show.

69
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:38,320
我们会接几个观众来电
Uh, we're gonna take some calls,

70
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:40,022
然后聊聊在"杀人猿2"
we'll talk about what it was like on the set

71
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:41,256
拍摄现场的情况
of Serial Ape-ist 2.

72
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:42,291
肯定会很有趣的
It should be really fun.

73
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:43,759
- 会很令人兴奋的  - 好吧
- This is exciting.  - Yeah.

74
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:44,960
有多少人会听?
So, how many people listen?

75
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:46,228
很多人会事后下载
Most people download it later,

76
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,297
但一般会有几千个人在线听
but usually a few thousand people listen live.

77
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,265
什么?! 有几千个人
What?! A few thousand people

78
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,868
在线听你大聊宅男话题?
listen to you talk about nerd stuff?

79
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,371
再说一次 听在耳边
Again, right in the ears,

80
00:02:56,373 --> 00:02:58,307
伤在心里
straight to the feelings.

81
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:02,978
你能把盐递过来吗?
Can you please pass the salt?

82
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,780
当然
Sure.

83
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:07,583
反正我没被邀请去理查德·费曼故居
It's not like I was invited to Richard Feynman's house

84
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:10,018
也没什么事情做
and have anything better to do.

85
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,955
今晚你就打算用这态度过了?
Is this how the rest of the night's going to be?

86
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:15,257
我又看不到未来
I don't know the future.

87
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:18,493
你觉得会不会有一颗
Do you think there's a chance

88
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:20,495
小行星撞上地球
that an asteroid could hit the Earth,

89
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:23,966
毁掉理查德·费曼故居和里面的所有人?
destroying Feynman's house and everyone in it?

90
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:26,134
不会 Sheldon
No, Sheldon.

91
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:29,471
那系好安全带 今晚会天摇地动的
Then buckle up, you're in for a cranky night.

92
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:32,341
你一向坚持贯彻的
According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement

93
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:33,809
恋爱条例的附加条约里写过
which you insisted upon,

94
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:36,445
约会的时候我们不能生气或不高兴
we're not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.

95
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:40,582
要知道 我加这条是为了防范你姨妈期的情绪
You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.

96
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:44,052
好吧 但对你也适用
Well, it applies to you, too.

97
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:46,855
我就怕你会提到这点
I was afraid you might bring this up,

98
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:50,025
所以我想了办法解决
so I have a work-around.

99
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:56,898
看吧
There you go.

100
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,706
正如你看到的 我在笑呢
As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling.

101
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:07,976
我必须承认 我现在是真的有点笑了
Although, I must admit, I'm smiling a little bit

102
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:10,312
因为钻俩小洞简直是天才之举
at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.

103
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:14,516
Bernadette 你有没有想过
So, Bernadette, have you thought

104
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:16,785
要怎么重新装修这个房子?
about how you're going to redecorate this place?

105
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:18,754
嗯 我想要
You know, I'm thinking

106
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:20,255
扯掉地毯
ripping up the carpets,

107
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:21,990
可能要剥掉墙纸
maybe lose the wallpaper,

108
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:23,325
重新装照明灯...
all new light fixtures...

109
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:25,160
要知道 如果你敲掉这堵墙
You know, if you knocked out this wall,

110
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:26,895
就会有一个开放式的空间
it would give you an open floor plan,

111
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:31,033
然后... 听着有点可怕 不过会很有趣的...
and then... it's a little scary, but could be fun...

112
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,036
来个室内篝火
indoor fire pit.

113
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:37,939
嘿 我在这房子里长大的 懂吗?
Hey, I grew up in this house, okay?

114
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:40,542
不准砸掉任何东西
No one's knocking anything down.

115
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:42,177
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay.

116
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:43,512
等他去漫展的时候
When he's at Comic-Con,

117
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:46,348
我就带个铁球来砸墙
I'm bringing in a wrecking ball.

118
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:49,751
有什么事?
Can I help you?

119
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:52,087
你好 你是Howard Wolowitz吗?
Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?

120
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,655
对
Yes.

121
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,357
这可能有点尴尬
Um, this is a little weird,

122
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,492
但有个律师联系了我的父亲
but a lawyer was trying to contact my father,

123
00:04:57,494 --> 00:05:00,095
因为这栋房子仍旧在他的名下
because his name was still on the title for this house.

124
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:02,531
什... 什么 谁是你父亲?
W... uh, who's your father?

125
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,399
Sam Wolowitz啊
Sam Wolowitz.

126
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:08,370
他是我父亲啊
S-Sam Wolowitz is my father.

127
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:10,272
我知道
I know.

128
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:14,242
嗯 等等 如果我们的父亲是同一个人...
Well, wait, so if we have the same father...

129
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,545
那么你就是说
are you saying

130
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:17,547
你是我的同父异母的弟弟吗?
you're my half-brother?

131
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,381
我觉得是这样的
I think so.

132
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:23,685
Bernadette 这边的事太奇葩了!
Bernadette, weird things are happening out here!

133
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,990
我觉得当我看到这个剧本的电影名的时候
I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie

134
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:32,894
我就开始怀疑这是一部烂片了
when I looked at the script and saw the title,

135
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:35,530
杀人恶猿2之
Serial Ape-ist 2:

136
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:38,533
猴见猴杀
Monkey See, Monkey Kill.

137
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:39,868
剧透警告:
Uh, spoiler alert:

138
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,571
当猴子看到你时 它就会杀你
after the monkey sees, it kills.

139
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:44,773
给你
Psst.

140
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:46,508
我刚才接到了一个小纸条
I've just been handed a note.

141
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,777
我准备把它读出来
I'm going to read it.

142
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,114
"Wil 你还要健怡可乐吗? 
"Wil, do you want more Diet Coke?

143
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,151
我们还有果汁哟"
Also, we have juice."

144
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:00,155
我没想打断你们来着
I-I didn't want to interrupt.

145
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,791
嗯 刚才那个声音
Uh, that voice you just heard

146
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:04,626
是Leonard发出来的 Penny的未婚夫
belongs to Leonard, Penny's fiancé.

147
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:06,628
Leonard 你为什么不戴个耳机加入我们呢?
Uh, Leonard, why don't you grab some headphones and join us?

148
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,163
- 可以吗?  - 是啊
- Really?  -  Yeah.

149
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:09,498
太棒了
Yeah, great.

150

那么 当Leonard准备的时候
So, while Leonard gets set up,

154
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:18,173
我没什么要问的
I don't have a question.

155
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:20,308
我只是想说我是这个电影的一个粉丝
I just want to say I'm a big fan of the movie.

156
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,877
这部电影我大概看了有10遍吧
I've seen it, like, ten times.

157
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,312
好吧 我对第一遍深表抱歉
Okay, well, I'll apologize for the first time,

158
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,581
不过剩下的那九遍可是你自己找的啊
but the other nine are on you.

159
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:29,518
非常感谢 这位观众
Thanks a lot, caller.

160
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,920
你知道吗 其实这部电影
You know that the movie actually 

161
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,053
另类得挺受欢迎的
a little bit of a cult following.

162
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:33,221
- 真的吗?  - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah.

163
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:34,556
我当时在一个科幻展上
I was at a science-fiction convention

164
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:37,893
看到了一个女人打扮成了你演的那个半人半猿角色
and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.

165
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,294
哦 如果她是
Oh, if she was

166
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:41,463
和一个穿的像一个香蕉一样的印度人在一起的话
with an Indian guy dressed like a banana,

167
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:44,199
那他们就是我的两个朋友Howard和Raj
that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.

168
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:47,769
好 现在我们来接一个特约嘉宾的电话
All right, it's time for a very special guest caller,

169
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:49,371
他是我的一个朋友 你们可能能认出
a friend of mine, who you probably know

170
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:51,773
他是Clerks电影的导演
as the director of such movies as Clerks,

171
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,441
或者从播客和书里
or from podcasts and books

172
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,210
听到看到他自卖自夸 自己就是那个
where he often reminds you that he's the guy

173
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,378
导演了Clerks的人
who directed Clerks.

174
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,746
你好 Kevin Smith
Hello, Kevin Smith.

175
00:06:57,748 --> 00:06:59,681
嗨 哥们 你过得还好吧 Wil?
KEVIN: Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil?

176
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,750
因为都过了两分钟了
'Cause it's been, like, two minutes

177
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:04,653
你还没扯到Stand By Me这部你的成名电影
and you haven't even brought up Stand By Me.

178
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,556
嗨 Kevin!
Hey, Kevin!

179
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,157
和你说话我好激动啊
It's really exciting to talk to you.

180
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,325
真心的
It really is.

181
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,360
啊 你们嘴太甜了 所以 Penny 听好了
Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen,

182
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:13,695
我看过你的电影了
I saw your movie.

183
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,831
哇哦 这么烂我也不想的
Oh, wow. I wish it was better.

184
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,898
哦 别担心 
Oh, don't worry about it.

185
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,867
你看过Kevin的电影吗?
Have you seen some of Kevin's films?

186
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,637
你在找打吗 Wheaton 
You're cruisin' for a beatin', Wheaton.

187
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:25,907
好了 我挺喜欢这部电影 Penny
Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny.

188
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:27,876
我觉得你演的非常好
And I thought you were, like, really great in it.

189
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:29,044
天哪
Aw.

190
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:30,212
你知道吗 我也在这部电影里呢
You know, I'm in the movie, too.

191
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:31,813
是又怎么样 Penny!
Yeah, whatever. Penny!

192
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:35,317
Penny 你怎么不多拍点电影?
Penny, how come you're not in more stuff, man?

193
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,518
我现在就想让你试镜了
I'd cast you in a minute.

194
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,420
- 真的吗?  - 是啊
- Seriously?  - Oh, yeah, man.

195
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,255
我现在正在准备一部电影的前期工作
I'm actually in pre-production on a movie right now.

196
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:41,356
它和我之前
Way different

197
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:42,724
做的大不一样
than anything I've ever done before.

198
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,060
这部电影叫Clerks三
It's called Clerks 3.

199
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,595
你应该过来
You should come over

200
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:48,396
试着演一段
and read for a part.

201
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:50,599
哦 天哪 太好了
Oh, my, I would love that.

202
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,000
你已经有了新工作了啊
You have a new job.

203
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,635
我可以兼职啊
Well, maybe I can do both.

204
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:56,104
我觉得你不行
I don't think you can do both.

205
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:58,440
我好像没问你意见吧
I don't think I asked you.

206
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:00,275
嗯 告诉他 Penny
Yeah, you tell him, Penny.

207
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:04,679
关你什么事 Kevin Smith
Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.

208
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:08,149
你觉得人会活到某个岁数之后
Do you think there comes a point in life

209
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:11,353
被忽视也觉得不难过吗?
when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?

210
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,754
可能不会吧
Probably not.

211
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:14,856
融入社交活动
It's an evolutionary advantage

212
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:17,025
对进化是有好处的啊
to be included in group activities.

213
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:18,593
你知道吗?
You know what?

214
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:20,595
我曾经是进化论的粉丝
I used to be a fan of evolution

215
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,330
但是我已经完全进化完了
but I've since evolved,

216
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:24,900
所以现在 我觉得挺蠢的
and now I think it's dumb.

217
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:27,702
被忽视是一种糟糕的感觉
Being left out is a terrible feeling.

218
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:29,804
没人比我更了解这种感受
No one understands that better than I do.

219
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:31,640
嘿 看看你
Hey, look at that.

220
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:34,743
你在你自己举的例子里面都是一个人
Even in your example, you're all by yourself.

221
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,747
当我们学校爆发虱子传染病时
When there was a lice epidemic at my school

222
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,582
除了我之外别人都得了
everybody got it except me.

223
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:43,418
我在我头发上撒糖 想蒙骗大家
I tried to fool everyone by sprinking sugar in my hair,

224
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,821
但是我却被蜜蜂蛰了
but I just got attacked by bees.

225
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:49,891
我脑子里都有画面了
I can just picture them all right now

226
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,126
他们在费曼故居
at Feynman's house

227
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:52,327
讨论着薛定谔
probably discussing Schrodinger

228
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,329
同时
and at the same time

229
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:56,665
{\an8}这里借用了"薛定谔的猫"的梗

230
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:56,665
也没有讨论薛定谔
not discussing Schrodinger.

231
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,233
对吧?
See?

232
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:02,170
他们错过了这样搞笑的笑话
They're missing out on hilarious jokes like that.

233
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,372
同时也没错过
And at the same time, not.

234
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,076
又让我回想起小时候 我那傻哥傻姐
It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister

235
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:09,711
俩人在客厅建床单堡垒
would build forts in the living room

236
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:11,313
还不让我进去
and wouldn't let me in.

237
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:13,949
我太讨厌那种感觉了
I hated that so much.

238
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:16,184
虽说
You know,

239
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:17,385
我不能帮你
there's nothing I can do

240
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,287
得到研讨会的邀请
about getting you invited to the symposium,

241
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:21,456
但如果你愿意...
but if you wanted...

242
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,358
我们可以建一个堡垒
we could build a fort.

243
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:26,294
这会不会太幼稚?
Isn't that a little juvenile?

244
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:28,463
比这还幼稚吗?
More juvenile than this?

245
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:33,168
我去拿毯子
I'll get the blankets.

246
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,869
你去谷歌一下 怎么才能像小孩一样玩得欢
You Google how to have childlike fun.

247
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,075
看来我有点招待不周
You know what, I'm being a bad host.

248
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:41,276
我再去拿一些咖啡
Let me get some more coffee.

249
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,678
- 让我来 Howard  - 不用了 我可以
- Oh, let me do it, Howard.  - No, I got it.

250
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,615
Josh 你是做什么的?
So, Josh, what do you do?

251
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:49,951
我在圣地亚哥修读海洋学
I'm studying oceanography down in San Diego.

252
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:52,153
真不错
Oh, how nice.

253
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:58,560
我喜欢"海底总动员"
I loved Finding Nemo.

254
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:00,562
闲话少说
Enough chitchat.

255
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,263
我们怎么知道你说的是真的?
How do we know you are who you say you are?

256
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:04,599
我为什么要骗人?
Why would I lie?

257
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:06,901
好吧 你难住我了
Okay, you got me there.

258
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,572
- 你来这是要借钱吗?  - 不
- You here looking for money?  - No.

259
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:13,041
那是要他的肾 眼角膜 还是肝吗?
A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?

260
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:14,409
不
No.

261
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,277
那你有一支披头士翻唱乐队
You're in a Beatles cover band

262
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,547
想让Howard代替你爸当林戈
and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.

263
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,851
你去看看咖啡怎么样了吧?
Why don't you help with the coffee?

264
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:25,820
好的 但有东西不对劲(有鱼腥味)
Okay, but something smells fishy.

265
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:26,855
不单单是因为
And not just because

266
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:28,323
你研究海底生物的缘故
you work around sea animals.

267
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,458
其实海洋学还挺有意思的
That actually sounds interesting,

268
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,160
有机会我想多了解一些
and I'd like to learn more about it.

269
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,364
嘿 你没事吧?
Hey, you okay?

270
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,899
有事
Not really.

271
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:40,502
这家伙凭空出现
This guy shows up out of the blue,

272
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:42,070
我突然间有弟弟了?
and now I have a brother?

273
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:45,340
我爸还成了另一个家?
My father has another family?

274
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,175
我能理解
I get it.

275
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:48,977
你打算怎么办?
What do you want to do?

276
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,979
我不知道 我...
I don't know. I...

277
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,814
我只想让他离开
I'd just like him to go away.

278
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:54,482
我还没准备好
I can't deal with this.

279
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,451
好吧 我帮你解决
All right, I've got your back.

280
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,620
谢谢你 走吧
Thank you. Come on.

281
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,189
顺便说一句
And I'd like to point out

282
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:04,526
这墙真是保护隐私的利器!
this wall just provided a lot of privacy!

283
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:08,063
我哥竟然是个宇航员
I can't believe my brother's an astronaut.

284
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:09,964
- 真不可思议 那是什么体验?  - 听着 小伙子
- That's amazing.  What was it like?  - Listen, dude,

285
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,266
你是时候该离开了
it's time for you to hit the road.

286
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:13,735
嘿 这年轻人问了个好问题
Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.

287
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:24,242
刚转频道的听众朋友
So, for those of you just tuning in,

288
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:25,576
您正在收听
we are listening

289
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,945
- 我的搭档和他未婚夫在吵...  - 不不不
- to a really fun fight between my costar...  - No, no, no.

290
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:29,180
我们没在吵架 我们只是在...
We're not fighting; we're just...

291
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:30,615
交流
having a conversation.

292
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:32,316
好吧
All right.

293
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:35,186
您正在收听我在杀人猿2中的搭档演员
We're listening to a really fun conversation

294
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:38,356
和他未婚夫之间有趣的"交流"
between my costar from Serial Ape-ist 2

295
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,024
而在他看来
and her fiancé, who doesn't believe

296
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:42,526
女人不该有梦想
women should have dreams.

297
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,632
把果汁还给我
Give me back that juice.

298
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:50,434
我试下镜有何妨?
What is the harm if I audition?

299
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:51,836
可万一你试成了呢?
Well, what if you get it?

300
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,938
我不知道 或许拍个电影
I don't know, I make a movie,

301
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,573

302
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:56,774
赢个奥斯卡 金球奖
win an Oscar, a Golden Globe

303

304
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:01,512
就靠Kevin Smith的电影?
From a Kevin Smith movie?

305
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:04,882
我要挂了
Oh, I'm hanging up now.

306
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:06,250
别听他说 伙计
Don't you listen to him, buddy.

307
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:07,485
你很棒
You're awesome.

308
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,487
你是史上最佳导演之一
You're one of the greatest directors of our time.

309
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:12,189
我这没你的戏份 Wheaton
I don't have a part for you, Wheaton.

310
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:14,992
跟Kevin Smith的通话就到这里
And that was Kevin Smith.

311
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:17,361
多谢你啊
Thanks a lot.

312
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,963
我只是在保护你
I'm just trying to protect you.

313
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:21,232
我多少次看见你为了演员梦
How many times did I see you get your heart broken

314
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:23,067
到头来心碎不已?
trying to make it as an actress?

315
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,702
与其保护我 你何不试着
Okay, instead of protecting me, why don't you try

316
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,504
在我遇到好事时表现得激动点?
being excited when something good happens?

317
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,773
我一直很为你激动啊!
I'm always excited for you!

318
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,508
你找到新工作 我很激动的
I'm excited that you found this new job

319
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,976
而且你的工资也不低
where you're making decent money.

320
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:34,178
不低? 我赚的钱可是你的两倍
Decent? I make twice what you make.

321
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,880
等等 两倍?!
Wait, twice?!

322
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,548
是啊
Yeah.

323
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,218
就是 "乘以二"的两倍
Like, "times two" twice?

324
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:44,355
在家收听的听众朋友 Leonard刚发现
For those of you at home, Leonard just found out

325
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:47,591
他未婚妻赚的钱完爆了他自己
his fiancée makes way more money than he does.

326
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:49,994
咱们接着听
Let's listen.

327
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:51,963
我上了半辈子的学
I went to school for half my life.

328
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:53,030
考取了博士学位
I have a doctorate.

329
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:55,700
可现在还在偿还助学贷款
I'm still paying off college loans.

330
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:56,801
你还欠多少?
Well, how much do you owe?

331
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:58,903
或许我能帮着还一点
Maybe I can help you out.

332
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,908
Wil 可以先暂停一下广播吗?
Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?

333
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,376
在家的听众朋友
For those of you at home,

334
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,678
我在摇头说不
I am shaking my head "no."

335
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:16,487
弄得怎么样了 Sheldon?
How's it going, Sheldon?

336
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:19,190
棒极了!
Wonderful!

337
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:22,193
我刚把彩灯挂上
I just finished hanging the lights.

338
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:23,394
我能进来吗?
Can I come in?

339
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:25,262
当然 不过要从侧面进来
Yes, oh, but enter through the side.

340
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,332
蝙蝠侠是载重的毯子
Batman is a load-bearing blanket.

341
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:34,638
好棒啊
Amazing.

342
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,140
我知道
I know.

343
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:37,508
这可不是打印出来的
This isn't the printout.

344
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,410
这是我的真脸
This is my real face.

345
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:42,013
我们愣着干嘛?
What are we doing?

346
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,314
这是个堡垒
This is a fort.

347
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:45,783
坐地上吧
Let's sit on the floor.

348
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,952
过苦日子? 好吧
Roughing it? Okay.

349
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:54,892
这样子看一切都显得好大
Everything looks so big from down here.

350
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:59,397
原来当Leonard是这种感觉
This must be how Leonard feels.

351
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:04,335
我有点意外你耳朵里
I'm surprised you could hear me

352
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:06,404
有片薄荷糖 你还听得见!
with this Thin Mint in your ear!

353
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,473
很厉害吧?
Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

354
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,441
是啊
Yeah.

355
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:14,378
总之 我差不多该走了
Anyway, I should probably get going.

356
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,713
Howie 你有没有发现你每次变魔术之后
Howie, have you noticed how often

357
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:18,482
人们的反应都是这样?
people say that when you start to do magic?

358
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:21,685
不好意思 我还要开好久的车回去
Sorry, I have a long drive.

359
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,522
好吧 有机会再见
Well, I hope I get to see you again.

360
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:26,123
好啊
I hope so, too.

361
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,960
我一直梦想着能有个兄弟和我一起玩传球游戏呢
I've always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.

362
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:32,630
接着做梦吧
Keep dreaming.

363
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,665
嘿 我在一次洛杉矶队的棒球比赛上
Hey, I threw out the first pitch

364
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,534
- 投了第一个球呢  - 哇
- at an Angels game.  - Wow.

365
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,270
他和机器人做的
He did it with a robot.

366
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,973
你和机器人睡了?
You had sex with a robot?

367
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:45,142
她不是这个意思
That's not what she meant.

368
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:46,777
不过从技术层面上来说 他确实睡过
But technically, yes.

369
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:50,981
等等 如果你挣了这么多钱
Hang on, if you're making all this money,

370
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:52,616
你都用来做什么了?
where is it?

371
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:53,751
存在安全的地方了
In a safe place.

372
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,286
什么意思 你放在床底下了?
What does that mean, under your bed?

373
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:56,654
不是啊
No, it means

374
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:59,023
我投到好几种不同的股票和债券里了
a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

375
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:00,424
我不是那种保守的人
I'm not overly conservative.

376
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:04,061
我还年轻 我的顾问说我可以冒点风险
I'm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.

377
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:06,664
等下 你还有"顾问"?
Wait a minute, you have "a guy"?

378
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,965
你没有吗?
Don't you have a guy?

379
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:11,202
我怎么会有理财顾问? 我连财都没有!
Why would I have a guy? I don't have any money!

380
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,170
哦 亲爱的
Oh, sweetie,

381
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:15,606
你真的应该去多挣点钱
you should really get some money.

382
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,842
正在收听直播的朋友们
For those of you listening at home,

383
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:20,845
这期节目是不是很精彩?
how great is this?

384
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:23,647
Wil 我拜托你先别录了行吗
Wil, I'm begging you, just please turn that off.

385
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,283
没问题
Sure.

386
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:28,352
欢迎回来
And we're back.

387
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:31,755
Leonard 这件事有这么重要吗?
Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this?

388
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:34,391
这几年 我们之间的角色确实发生了一些变化
So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years.

389
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:35,759
可生活就是这样的啊
This is the way life is.

390
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:38,028
而且我相信 我们的生活还会继续变化的
And I'm sure in time they'll change again.

391
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,298
真棒 现在你不光比我更事业有成
Great, you're not only more successful than me,

392
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,367
还比我更成熟懂事了
now you're more mature.

393
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,569
好吧 如果有一天我不去上班
Okay, look, would it make you feel better

394
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,873
而是愚蠢地去参加Kevin Smith的电影的试镜
if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day

395
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,509
你会不会感觉好一点?
to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?

396
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:53,844
那就太好了 谢了!
That would be great, thank you!

397
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,413
我想插一句
I'm just gonna jump in here real quick.

398
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,882
Leonard 就在刚才
Leonard, a moment ago,

399
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:01,118
你还死都不愿意让Penny继续她的演艺事业
you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career,

400
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,620
可现在你却全力支持
but now you're all for it.

401
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:05,990
这是不是说明 她把你当猴耍?
Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?

402
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:09,493
确实是 Wil
Yes, it is, Wil.

403
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,165
我真的好想知道
So, I have to ask,

404
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,567
那个机器人性感吗?
was the robot sexy?

405
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:18,669
其实吧
It was actually

406
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:21,438
那就是一条机械手臂而已
just a mechanical hand.

407
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,708
因为有机械手臂就够了 对吧?
Because that's all you need, right?

408
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,178
你真是我亲弟弟
You are my brother.

409
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:31,882
第一届城堡联赛
Okay, so the final four forts

410
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:34,451
也可以说是第一届"堡赛"的
in the first annual best fort ever contest,

411
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,520
四强选手分别是...
or "fort off," are...

412
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:38,956
诺克斯堡 (美国用于储备黄金的堡垒)
Fort Knox,

413
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,424
提康德罗加堡 (美国纽约州北部大型堡垒)
Fort Ticonderoga,

414
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:42,927
萨姆特堡 (美国一处石质防御工程) 以及...
Fort Sumter and...

415
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:45,196
舒服毯子堡
Fort Cozy McBlanket.

416
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:47,798
我觉得...
I'd say...

417
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,767
诺克斯堡比提康德罗加堡要好
Knox over Ticonderoga

418
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:50,868
因为那里面有美联储的金库
because it's got the gold.

419
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,770
同意 而舒服毯子堡比萨姆特堡要好
Mm-hmm. And McBlanket over Sumter

420
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:55,573
因为它针数更多 更严密保暖
because it has a higher thread count.

421
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,275
诶
Oh.

422
00:16:58,277 --> 00:17:00,978
十点了
10:00.

423
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,146
约会夜结束
Date night's over.

424
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,414
等等 别走
Wait, no.

425
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,915
我们还没选出冠军呢
We haven't picked a winner.

426
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,384
我们都知道谁会获胜啊
We both know this one's gonna win.

427
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,153
那倒是
Well, of course we do.

428
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:10,921
诺克斯堡可没有
Fort Knox doesn't have a secret

429
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:13,090
秘密物理图书馆
physics lending library.

430
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,227
好啦 我帮你收拾一下这里
Come on, I'll help you take this down.

431
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:17,294
等会
Well, wait.

432
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:19,363
如果 这一次
What if, just this once,

433
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:21,699
我们延长约会夜的时间长度
we suspend the date night parameters

434
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:24,468
你在这里多待一会 怎么样?
and you stay later?

435
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:30,341
只要我们都同意延长时间
Well, as long as we're suspending the parameters,

436
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:31,942
我可以待到很晚
I could stay really late

437
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:35,312
并且把今晚发展成第一次在你家过夜
and we could have our first sleepover.

438
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:37,615
这可是一大步啊
That's a big step.

439
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:40,784
这个城堡也不小
It's a big fort.

440
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:43,988
好吧
Very well.

441
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,824
我同意 今晚将是一次非限制级的
I will agree to a family-friendly,

442
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,627
女生在男生家里的过夜
G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.

443
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:52,963
是PG级 (须有家长指导观看)
PG.

444
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:56,400
有些场面可能会少儿不宜
Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.

445
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:58,636
还是非限制级吧
G-rated,

446
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:01,739
不过可能不适宜婴幼儿观看
with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.

447
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:05,876
就这么决定了
You got yourself a sleepover.

448
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:08,412
你需要去借牙刷
Do you need to borrow

449
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:09,780
或者睡衣吗?
a toothbrush or pajamas?

450
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,749
要是你知道
Would it alarm you to know

451
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:14,485
我两年前就在你家藏起来这些东西以防万一
that I hid those things here two years ago

452
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:16,720
你会觉得后怕吗?
just in case this ever came up?

453
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,190
当然会
It would,
