Well, it's just an educational model.

The external part is called the vulva,

90
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,120
and the lip bits you're talking about
are called the labia,

91

sizes, and colors.

Last term, I was sexually assaulted.

100
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,880
And I thought that I was getting over it,

101
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,280
but I don't think I am.

102
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,200
I used to like my body,
and I used to like having sex,

103
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,720
but ever since it happened,
I don't like the way my body feels.

104
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,680
I don't like looking at it.

105
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,520
I don't like
my boyfriend touching it anymore.

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,520
That must be difficult for you, Aimee.

107
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,520
Do you think you could tell me
a little bit more about the assault?

108
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,560
I was going to school,

109
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,160
and everything felt normal.

110
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720

111
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,600

to talk about it sometimes.

about anything you don't want to.

Well, you may never be the old you, Aimee,

118
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
but that's okay.

119
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,840
As human beings,
we are constantly changing and developing.

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,480
And by processing this trauma,

121
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,080
you may gain clarity on the event itself,

122
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,520
And they do things so differently there.
Everything. Everything is so controlled.

179
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
This is it!

180
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,480
[whimsical music playing]

181
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,640
[Lily] Where'd it go?

182
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,800
It… it was here, I swear.

183
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,800
Maybe someone did it as a hoax.

184
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,560
[funky music playing]

185
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
[indistinct chattering]

186
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,480
Good morning, Hope.

187
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,720
I've had ideas about how I can use my time
as head girl in the most productive way.

188
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,680
- Cool, hit me.
- Great.

189
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,920
I wanna create
a Moordale newsletter run by students.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,400
I've been researching
how we can make the campus more green

191
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,360
by using solar panels and tree planting.

192
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,720
I wanna set up
an environmental student board on campus.

193
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,080
I read a study that said yoga
during break time creates more efficiency,

194
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
so free yoga classes
alongside food-education classes.

195
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,400
- And I think...
- That is fantastic.

196
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,960
I want to set up a meeting
to talk it through properly.

197
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,880
In the meantime, I need you to make sure

198
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,280
all your peers are wearing
their uniforms correctly.

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,600
Absolutely, will do.

200
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,840
Okay. Any problems, you send them to me.

201
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,880
- Hey.
- Hey.

202
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
[Cal] Hey, Jackson.

203
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,440
Whoa, whoa! Fuck.

204
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,840
Falling at my feet now?

205
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,480
[exhales]

206
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,600
[Cal] Man, you look kind of screwed, dude.

207
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah, um…

208
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,480
[coughs] Everything got
really fuzzy for a second.

209
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,960
Did you forget to eat breakfast?

210
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,720
Breakfast is my favorite food.

211
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
[chuckles]

212
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
Okay, but is breakfast a food or a meal?

213
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,960
[scoffs]

214
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,800
Thanks.

215
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Every time I see you,
I feel like I've known you for ages.

216
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,360
[chuckles]
I think that's the dizzy spell talking.

217
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,600
[chuckles] Come on, up you get.

218
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,080
Hi! Sorry. You're in the wrong uniform.

219
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,320
What is wrong about it?

220
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,920
It's the boys' uniform.
It's way too big for you.

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,800
- I think it's a comfortable fit.
- I'm following new guidelines.

222
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,120
- You can let this one slide.
- Sorry, I can't.

223
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,760
- You'll have to talk to Hope about it.
- Oh! Well, that'll be fun.

224
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
[whimsical music playing]

225
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
Why did you do that?

226
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm not gonna disobey rules
because you have a crush.

227
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
I don't have a crush.
That's not the point.

228
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Unlike you,
I'm taking head girl seriously.

229
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,000
[scoffs]

230
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,640
You can be so cutthroat sometimes, Viv.

231
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,560
[indistinct chattering]

232
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,960
I do not do fake wool.

233
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
This blazer is itchy as fuck.

234
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,360
At least we look better in them
than everyone else.

235
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,160
- Yeah.
- She didn't mean you.

236
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,360
- Hi, Ruby.
- Hey.

237
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
Gray is not my color.

238
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
Come on. It's not that bad.

239
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,480
I kinda like it.

240
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,400
[Ruby] OT!

241
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,520
- Um, yeah.
- See you.

242
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,600
Okay, um, I'm going to need you
to make an effort tonight.

243
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,800
- Okay.
- I need you to talk, open up a bit.

244
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
Okay, I understand.

245
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,480
[Eric] Cool.

246
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,000
[clattering]

247
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Hi, Rahim.

248
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,400
I would like my books back.

249
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,240
Pablo Neruda, Maya Angelou.

250
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,840
Sure, I'll bring them in for you.

251
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,360
I'd also like you to return
the poems I wrote for you,

252
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,200
that is, if you haven't destroyed them.

253
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,120
I still have the poems, yes.

254
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,360
I burnt everything you ever gave me
in a small, controlled fire, so…

255
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,360
Okay, I will get you your poems.

256
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,240
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

257
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,880
- You have confiture on your tie.
- Hm?

- [bell ringing]

[indistinct chattering]

260
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,760
Hi. How was therapy?

261
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Oh, it was amazing!

262
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,960
Do you know most women's vulvas
don't look like they do on PornHub?

263
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,520
I thought mine was a bit ugly
because it's not all tucked in,

264
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
but it's dead normal.

265
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,280
You should read <i>Come As You Are</i>
by Emily Nagoski. It's a great book.

266
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,080
- I'll lend it to you.
- Okay.

267
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,800
You look nice, babe.

268
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,160
Is everything okay? I feel like
we barely see each other at the moment.

269
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Aw, everything's fine.
Just really busy with my baking.

270
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
Good morning, Moordale.

Don't you all look smart?

[Adam coughs]

274
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,240
[Hope] I know this probably feels
like a big change,

275
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,560
but you'll find that having a uniform
creates a sense of unity

276
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,880
and equilibrium.

277
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,760
And speaking of changes,

278
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,680
the choir will now sing
the new school anthem,

279
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,400
"Non Sibi, sed Toti."

[choir singing in Latin]

284
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,160
Why are they singing in elf language?

285
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,520
I think it's Latin.

286
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
- Well, what does it mean?
- "Not for oneself, but for all."

- Do you wanna hang out later?
- Yeah. I've got...

290
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,440
I need to see you both
in my office, please.

291
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,640
- Oh, Maeve?
- Yeah?

292
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Come with me.

[whimsical music playing]

294
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,400

[Hope chuckles]

296
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Please, sit down.

297

Iced VoVos, anyone?

298
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,720
My husband made them.

299
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,640
They're biscuits. They won't bite.

[Maeve clears throat]

301
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,440
- They've told me to come talk to you.
- Yes. Come on in. Shut the door, please.

- [sniffs]
- [door closes]

303
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,280
I know breaking old habits is hard work,

304
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,080
but I want you all following uniform rules
by the end of the week.

305
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,640
Cal, you can go and put these on.

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
[Cal grunts]

307
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm not wearing a skirt.

308
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,200
Fine.

309
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,880
You don't want to wear a skirt,
that's up to you. I'm a feminist.

310
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,880
I understand.
But you will wear a uniform that fits you.

311
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,400
No baggy trousers
hanging around your ankles.

312
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,960
- I actually...
- I think I'm being more than fair.

313
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,000
Lily,

314
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,560
your hair and makeup is fun,

315
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,440
but it's not appropriate for school.

316
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,480
Maeve, this isn't a campus
for Cookie Monsters.

317
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,240
- Are you referring to my hair?
- I am.

318
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,560
Ola, only school badges allowed,
I'm afraid.

319
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,840
It's my LGBTQIA+ badge.
It's important to me.

320
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,000
Of course it is, but I hope
that your values aren't so fragile

321
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,680
that a little badge
is all that supports them.

322
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,280
Remove it.

323
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,640
Lily, am I right in thinking
that you wrote the musical last term?

324
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
What did your parents think of it?

325
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,280
They didn't really get it.

326
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Hm.

327
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,640
Well, enjoy the VoVos.

328
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
Back to class.

[whimsical music continues]

330
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, Maeve?

331
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,880
Miss Sands tells me
you're interested in applying

332
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,360
for the Gifted & Talented program
in the States.

333
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,280
Uh, no, I can't afford it.

334
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,240
I want opportunities in this school to be
for everyone, no matter their background,

335
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,920
so I'm going to see what I can do
about getting some funding,

336
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
so you better get that application in
as soon as you can.

337
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,280
Okay.

338
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,720
I will.

339
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480

- Yep.

517
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,040
This is not the message
the world is giving me.

518
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,400
Maybe try
just being Jackson Marchetti for a bit?

519
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400
All right, I'll try.

What's Minneapolis like?

522
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,640
Whoa, that feels really weird

523
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,440

- Minneapolis-ah.

525
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,880
- [Cal chuckles]
- Pa-la-pa-la-pa.

526
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,160
- Why does that feel so weird?
- I think you're just getting really high.

527
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,600
- Oh, is it?
- It is, yeah.

[Eric] Ruby, you have slayed your look!

534
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,600
It smells like canned soup in here.

535
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,400
Hi.

536
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,320
- How are you?
- [Eric] I'm good. Good look.

537
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,840
- Hi.

[Adam sucks lips]

540
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,360
There's nothing gluten-free.

541
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,360
How long have you been diabetic?

542
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,120
I'm not diabetic.

543
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,320
You can't eat sugar.

544
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,400
Gluten, Adam. Not glucose.

545
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,800
[whimsical music playing]

546
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,200
Does anyone else…

547
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,920
like the smell of their own farts?

548
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,320
[Eric exhales]

549
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,960

550
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,240
[chuckles] A bit nervous. It's hot.

551
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,080

552
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,440

[Ola sighs]

557
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,880
Jean was unpacking my mum's stuff today.

558
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,920
Felt strange.

559
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,840
I miss her so much.

aliens made the crop circle disappear.

561

but I think the 8th is still gonna happen.

562
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,920
What's the 8th?

563
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,680
[Lily] All these stars are gonna align,

564
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,440
which will allow one alien mothership
to make it to Earth.

565
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,080
It's gonna change everything.

Okay, cool.

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,920
So, are you guys excited
about going to France?

Not really, I get coach-sick.

581
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,040
Aw. I wish I could go.
Got to go to a wedding in Nigeria.

582
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,280
[Eric chuckles]

583
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,720
Isn't it illegal to be gay in Nigeria?

584
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,080
Yeah, it is,
but no one knows I am there, so…

585
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,680
[Adam] I didn't know it was illegal.

586
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,760
- Yeah, it's no big deal.
- It sounds like a big deal.

587
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
Can we talk about it later?

588
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,400
Adam, how is your dad?

589
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,480
Uh, I don't know.
I haven't seen him for a while.

590
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,840
My parents are separated.

591
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Yeah. Yeah, I heard, sorry.

592
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,640
Well, my mum's having a baby
with Ola's dad, which is kind of weird

593
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,840
because we used to date,
and now we're like actual siblings.

594
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,800
Maybe don't tell people that.

595
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,040
Pretty weird, dude.

596
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,680
How do you feel about it?
New family, baby, and stuff?

597
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
It's a big adjustment

598
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
'cause I'm an only child,
but I'm trying to be more adult.

599
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,280
Yeah, I think Ola's finding it hard too.

600
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,240
After her mum died
and her sister's gone off to university,

601
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,520
it's just been her and her dad, so…

602
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,200
[sniffs] …maybe you can
help each other out.

603
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
- Did I say the wrong thing?
- [Otis] No.

604
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,080
That was very astute, actually.

- [Ruby] Holy shit!
- What?

00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Kim Kardashian's having
another surrogate baby.

607
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,520
She is so bold. I can't believe it.

608
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,240
Don't you think it's weird how

609
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,600
the last surrogate was never in the show?

610
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,480

Thor Nyman.

That's a strong boy's name, huh?

678
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,760
Why does a boy's name need to be strong?

Well, you said yourself,
the kick was strong.

680
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,280
Yes, but the baby can be any sex
and have a strong kick.

681
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,320
And why do you just assume
the baby's going to have your surname?

682
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,040
[chuckles] It ain't gonna be Milburn
'cause that's your ex-husband's name.

683
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,720
No, but it could be my maiden name,
which is Franklin.

684
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,600
You gonna change your name
back to Franklin?

685
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,400
I don't know!

686
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,960
Probably not,
but I haven't thought about it yet.

687
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,920
Well, then it makes more sense
if the baby's a Nyman.

688
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,240
It's easier
to stick to traditions, I think.

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,960
