1
00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:05,398
关于蝙蝠侠我有个问题
I have a question about Batman.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,539
蝙蝠侠是个打扮像蝙蝠的人
Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,909
侠蝙蝠则是人和蝙蝠的混合体
Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid.

4
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:15,343
那么
Now,

5
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:18,647
如果侠蝙蝠打扮成人的样子抗击犯罪
if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime,

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,983
他该叫做侠蝙蝠侠吗?
would he be Man-Batman?

7
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:25,087
不 他该叫做蝙蝠侠蝙蝠
No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.

8
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:28,490
可侠蝙蝠侠不就是
But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman

9
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:31,126
一个被受辐射的人类咬过的蝙蝠侠吗?
that was bitten by a radioactive man?

10
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:33,095
可蝙蝠侠是个人啊
But Batman is a man.

11
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:36,131
你说的是有正常人类能力的人
You're talking about a man who would have the powers of a man.

12
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:39,134
那就是人侠
That's just Man-Man.

13
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:40,969
人侠不就是普通的人吗?
Well, isn't Man-Man just Man?

14
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,938
可如果人侠打扮成蝙蝠的样子呢?
But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,839
那就是蝙蝠侠了
Well, that's just Batman.

16
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:45,874
不对 如果人打扮成蝙蝠的样子
No, if a man dresses as a bat,

17
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:48,043
就是蝙蝠侠 可如果人侠打扮成蝙蝠的样子
that's Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat,

18
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,845
那就是蝙蝠人侠
that's Batman-Man.

19
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,948
这个回答满意吗?
So does that answer your question?

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,650
我还没问问题呢
Oh, I haven't asked it yet.

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,019
Claire发消息了 得走了
Oh, that's Claire. Got to run.

22
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,055
还以为你和Emily和好了
I thought you were back with Emily.

23
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:02,757
事实上我两边都见着...呢
Uh, actually I'm... seeing both of them.

24
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,461
你是说躲在窗外的林子里偷窥?
You mean like through their window from behind a bush?

25
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,799
不 事实上我同时和她们两个约会
No, I'm actually dating two women.

26
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:13,502
待会见
Later.

27
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:15,337
扯呢吧?
Really?

28
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:17,672
好几年都不能和女人说话的家伙
The guy who for years couldn't even talk to women

29
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:19,307
现在同时交往两个女人了?
is suddenly going out with two of them?

30
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:21,176
- 那怎么可能啊?  - 是啊
- How is that possible?  - I know.

31
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:22,644
科学家已经尝试过用
Scientists have tried to reproduce it

32
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:23,879
计算模型来重现它了
with computational models,

33
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,015
可是 在所有情况下 世界都会崩溃
but, in each case, the world blows up.

34
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:34,556
说真的 那个家伙现在同时和两个女人约会?
Seriously, that guy's dating two women?

35
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:39,327
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

36
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,664
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

37
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,299
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

38
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,835
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

39
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:49,504
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:52,174
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *

46
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,305
你搞这些派对用的长面包干什么?
What, why did you get a party sub?

47
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:11,374
反正有人来 这东西看起来挺有意思的
People are coming over; it looked fun.

48
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:14,511
我们不过是要看权力的游戏而已
Well, we're only watching Game of Thrones.

49
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:15,912
派对面包说明这是一场派对
A party sub implies it's a party.

50
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:19,849
可你参加的话就不算是了
Your attendance implies it's not.

51
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,185
我和其他人喜欢派对的程度是一样的
I like a party as much as the next man,

52
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:24,287
只要其他人不那么喜欢开派对
as long as the next man doesn't like a party.

53
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,490
随便说一句 别忘了
Oh, by the way, don't forget,

54
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,893
明天是每季度的室友协议会谈
tomorrow is our quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.

55
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:31,327
Sheldon 我们不需要每三个月
Oh, Sheldon, we don't need a meeting

56
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,729
就搞一次会谈 不是吗?
every three months. Hmm?

57
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,131
听起来很像是能在每季度的室友协议会谈上
Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up

58
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,599
提出的议题呢
at a quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.

59
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,002
啊正好 就是明天了
Lucky for you it's tomorrow.

60
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:40,537
你知道吗?
Oh, you know what?

61
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:41,738
我不想参加
I'm not going.

62
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,273
你必须参加
Well, you have to go.

63
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:46,376
这是Penny第一次领头宣誓誓词
It's Penny's first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.

64
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,679
会谈就是浪费时间
This meeting is a waste of time.

65
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,947
我们是否
Whether we make the switch

66
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,882
从Post牌的葡萄干麦片换成Kellogg牌的葡萄干麦片
from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran

67
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:55,852
不需要走议会程序
should not require parliamentary procedure.

68
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:59,722
你知道他们之一有在葡萄干上放糖
You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.

69
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:02,525
只有你一个人吃那些东西!
You're the only one who eats them!

70
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:04,160
然而你有发表意见的权力
And yet you get to weigh in.

71
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,828
这是民主... 很有意思 不是吗?
Democracy... it's pretty cool, isn't it?

72
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,865
我不参加 你不能逼我参加
I'm not going; you can't make me.

73
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,533
那我们走着瞧
Well, we'll just see about that.

74
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,035
怎么了?
What is the problem?

75
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,102
他说他不参加
He says he's not coming

76
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:14,237
明天的室友协议会谈
to the Roommate Agreement meeting tomorrow.

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,040
天啊 那我还背宣誓词干什么吗?
Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?

78
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:20,877
你自娱自乐去吧 我不参加
You have fun. I will not be attending.

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,278
好吧 如果你不愿意的话
Oh, fine. We don't have to have

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
我们可以不搞室友协议会谈
a Roommate Agreement meeting if you don't want to.

81
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:25,848
- 多谢  - 当然了 这得投票决定
- Thank you.  - Of course, it will require a vote.

82
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,885
不幸的是 正式的法槌在我卧室里
Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom,

83
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,087
幸运的是 我还准备了便携法槌
but luckily, I have my travel gavel.

84
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,092
你在无理取闹
You're being ridiculous.

85
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,694
现在有一个提案 我在无理取闹
There's a motion on the floor, "I'm ridiculous."

86
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:38,795
有人支持吗?
Do we have a second?

87
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:40,330
没人支持
Hmm? Hmm? There is no second.

88
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,497
否决提案
The motion is denied.

89
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,533
下次 先确保有人投票支持你
Next time, make sure you have the votes first.

90
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:44,534
很难看呢
That was embarrassing.

91
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:47,403
你能跟他谈谈吗?
Can you please talk to him?

92
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:49,105
为啥你要在这事上跟他较劲?
Well, why are you fighting him on this?

93
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:51,741
因为我讨厌总是顺着他
Because I am tired of him always getting his way.

94
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:52,909
根本不需要开什么傻兮兮的会
We don't need a stupid meeting.

95
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,177
我们甚至不需要有室友协议
We don't even need a Roommate Agreement,

96
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,613
希望这面包真的能开得起派对就好了!
and I hope that sandwich does cause a party!

97
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:00,683
我还是会参加你的会谈的
Well, I will still come to your meeting.

98
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:02,525
但愿如此 明天还得照相呢
Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow's picture day.

99
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,155
为啥你要支持他?
Why are you taking his side?

100
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:07,490
因为对他来说很重要
Because it's important to him,

101
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:09,225
我们签署了室友协议 就算达成了一致
and when we signed the Roommate Agreement, we made a deal.

102
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:12,362
继续那么说 你就可以参加护旗队了
Y-You keep talking like that, you're gonna make color guard.

103
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,668
- 哥们 我累死了  - 我知道
- Man, I'm worn out.  - I know.

104
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,638
要是在真实世界里走这么久就更累了
Imagine if we were actually moving.

105
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,109
不是这个 只是 自从我开始跟Claire和Emily同时交往后
No, it's just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily

106
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,545
我就感觉到精疲力尽
at the same time, it's exhausting.

107
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:31,080
你精疲力尽?
You're exhausted?

108
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:33,383
为了让你的老婆知道你在读育儿书
Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book

109
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,718
然后每隔五页折一次书 这才叫累
so your wife thinks you read it.

110
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,421
但是你比我幸运的多啊
But, dude, you're so lucky.

111
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:41,057
晚上你还能和自己的爱人待在一起
Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.

112
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,859
那我是比较幸运
I guess I am lucky.

113
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:46,262
就是啊 因为同时撩两个妹子
You are, because dating two women,

114
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,865
我甚至都不记得
I mean, I can't even remember

115
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:52,468
上一次在自己家睡觉是什么时候的事了
the last time I slept in my own apartment.

116
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,838
每次我醒来就在想"我在Claire家还是在Emily家
I wake up and I'm like, "Am I at Claire's or am I at Emily's?

117
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,107
或者是在第三个我忘记是谁的女孩子家?"
Is there a third girl I've forgotten about?"

118
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,609
就像是...
Like...

119
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:02,111
"我到底在哪儿?"
"Where am I?"

120
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,579
嗨Raj
Hey, Raj.

121
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,348
嘿 准妈妈做得怎么样了?
Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?

122
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,749
还好啦 就是有点累
Good. A little tired.

123
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:10,019
我理解你 我现在正脚踏几只船呢
I feel you. I've been dating multiple women.

124
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,121
你确定你真的不想
You sure you don't want to come

125
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,423
和我们一起看权力的游戏?
watch Game of Thrones with us?

126
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:14,657
你们玩吧
You guys have fun.

127
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,159
我就想躺在床上看会儿书
I'm just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.

128
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:19,629
这太好了... 睡自己的床
Oh, that sounds great... a bed to yourself.

129
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,832
我已经不知道这是什么感觉了
Can't even remember what that's like.

130
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,603
你一直在追权力的游戏吗?
Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?

131
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,838
可能吧
Mm, I think so.

132
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,776
就是龙啊 冰雪僵尸啊 还有所有的帅小伙都死了
Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.

133
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,678
这我就不清楚了
Oh, I don't know.

134
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,946
席恩·葛雷乔伊看着挺不错的
Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good

135
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:39,248
对于一个小丁丁被割掉的人来说
for a guy who had his genitals cut off.

136
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,954
有个小朋友还在生气呢
Uh-oh, somebody's still pouting.

137
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,055
别管我
Leave me alone.

138
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:47,690
如果是因为你弄丢了你的丁丁
If it's because you lost a stick,

139
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,625
我知道它去哪儿了
I know where it went.

140
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:52,662
一点也不好笑
Not funny.

141
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:53,896
你知道你最终会和他重归于好的
You know you're gonna make up with him.

142
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,264
那我们直接跳到最后一步不行吗?
Can we just skip to that part?

143
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,600
当然了 因为我是这里唯一的成年人嘛
Oh, of course, because I'm the only adult around here.

144
00:05:57,602 --> 00:05:59,135
真的吗? 唯一的成年人?
Really? The only adult?

145
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:00,937
是的 就是这样
Yeah, that's right.

146
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,005
今晚我要看的剧是M.A.限制级的
Tonight I'll be watching a show rated M.A.,

147
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,075
专门给"成熟的观众"看的 小鬼
and that stands for "Mature Audiences," buster.

148
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:08,378
好了 你应该明白作为"唯一的成年人"
All right, you would think "the only adult"

149
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,980
是不会让这点小事毁了真个晚上的
wouldn't let something silly ruin our entire night.

150
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:13,316
我觉得你应该明白为什么我这么生气
And I'd think you'd understand why I'm annoyed.

151
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:16,519
只要你去参加会议这些都可以被避免啊
All this could be avoided if you'd just come to the meeting.

152
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,387
我就是不想去
I don't want to.

153
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,388
这就是个会而已
Oh, it's just a meeting.

154
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,757
- 就一个简单的小会  - 不要再说"开会"了!
- One simple meeting.  - Stop saying "meeting"!

155
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,924
# 开会 开会 就开会 #
# Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting #

156
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:23,493
# 今天开会 明天开会 #
# Banana-fana, fo-feeting #

157
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:24,660
# 就是一直要开会... #
# Fee-fi mo-meeting... #

158
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:26,295
我带了我最拿手的菠菜酱
I brought my famous spinach dip.

159
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:27,663
嘿Amy 等一会
Yo, Amy, just one second.

160
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:28,931
# 开会 #
# Meeting. #

161
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:35,638
我不知道我想要男孩还是女孩
I'm not sure if I'm hoping for a boy or a girl.

162
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,906
如果是男孩
I mean, if it's a boy,

163
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,975
我就得教他怎么接球
I'm gonna have to teach him to play catch.

164
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,543
也就是说我得自己谷歌搜索
Which means I'm gonna have to Google

165
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:41,811
"怎么接球"
"How to play catch."

166
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:46,416
如果是女孩...
If it's a girl, I mean...

167
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:50,019
女孩太无辜脆弱了... 你知道男的都是什么鸟样
they're so innocent and... you know how guys are.

168
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:52,221
就是 男人真是太坏了
Totally, guys are the worst.

169
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:55,491
我想说 看看哥
I mean, look at me.

170
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:58,194
我让Emily给我做了煎饼果子
I let Emily make me a frittata

171
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:01,431
那晚我把吃剩下的放到了Claire的冰箱里
and I kept the leftovers in Claire's fridge that night.

172
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,599
我真是一个坏男孩
I'm such a dog.

173
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:07,837
又来了
There you go again.

174
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,973
对不起 我是不是抱怨太多了?
I'm sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?

175
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,342
你只是一直在假装抱怨
Actually, what you're doing is pretending to complain,

176
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:14,744
实际上你一直在炫耀
but really trying to brag.

177
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:16,412
你为什么这么说?
How could you say that?

178
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:18,714
"我多想在没有女生和我做羞羞事的时候
"Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea

179
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:22,885
就简简单单喝一杯茶"
without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."

180
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,655
我从没说过这个啊
I never said that.

181
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:28,224
"当你在沙发缝里找到其他女人的内衣
"Don't you hate it when you can't remember whose bra it is

182
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:30,793
但是不知道是谁的时候 简直抓狂啊"
you found wedged in your couch?"

183
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,730
好吧 这我的确说过
Okay, that I said.

184
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:36,766
但是这真是我的苦恼啊!
But that's a real problem!

185
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,634
你要是给错别人的内衣了
You give a girl another woman's bra,

186
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:41,103
那晚你就别想和她做羞羞的事了
and you will not be having sex with her that night.

187
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,972
或许可以和另外一个她做 但不是这个她
Maybe the other girl, but not her.

188
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:51,881
他怎么了?
What's going on with him?

189
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:53,249
他正为室友协定会议
Oh, he's all bent out of shape

190
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,151
生气着呢
about having a Roommate Agreement meeting.

191
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:58,754
看起来 全勤奖已经对他没有吸引力了
Apparently, perfect attendance isn't cool anymore.

192
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:01,357
不用担心 他会好的
Don't worry, he'll come around.

193
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,192
我理解他为什么这么生气
Well, I get why he's annoyed.

194
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:05,895
那是你不知道发生了什么
Well, then you don't understand what's happening.

195
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:07,530
你看...
See...

196
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:08,764
Leonard拒绝参加
Leonard refused to participate

197
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:11,133
每季强制性的室友协定会议
in a mandatory quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.

198
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:15,004
这就是看巴特·辛普森长大的人的样子
This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.

199
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:16,772
你不就喜爱辛普森一家
You love The Simpsons.

200
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:19,942
我喜欢的是丽萨·辛普森
I love Lisa Simpson.

201
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:23,946
我知道他的感受
Well, I know how he feels.

202
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:26,215
我也从不喜欢我们的恋爱关系协定会议
I never enjoyed our Relationship Agreement meetings.

203
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,917
等会儿
Wait.

204
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,018
你是装作喜欢的吗?
You were pretending?

205
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,354
对不起
Sorry.

206
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:32,955
不是吧!
No!

207
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:35,558
我才不信呢 我看得出来你很享受
I don't believe you. I could tell.

208
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:41,998
噢 Sheldon
"Oh, Sheldon,

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,232
我从没想过
"I never thought

210
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,600
聚在一起
"re-filing a matter

211
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:49,372
重新审核事宜是一件这么有意思的事
in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating."

212
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,077
这个嘛 你怎么看?
Hmm, what do you think?

213
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,947
你不会看不出来吧?
You don't know?

214
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,819
嘿 我说了什么让你不爽的话吗?
Hey, did I say something to upset you?

215
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:05,254
没有 我很好
No, I'm fine.

216
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,089
真的吗? 可是你平常都是和人家肩并肩一起走的
Really? Because usually we walk side by side,

217
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:09,125
但现在整整爬了两层楼
and I just went up two flights of stairs

218
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:12,094
我只能一直盯着你的屁股
staring at your bottom.

219
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:14,230
别放在心上
Just drop it.

220
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:16,499
好吧 我知道是怎么回事了
Okay, I think I see what's happening here.

221
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,767
你嫉妒我了
You're jealous of me.

222
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,001
拜托
Oh, please.

223
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:21,537
你有什么让我好嫉妒的?
What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?

224
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,274
不是我有什么 而是有几个人和我一起做什么
It's not what I have, it's how many people I'm having it with.

225
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,945
走吧 Sheldon 我们去我那里看权力的游戏
Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch Game of Thrones over here.

226
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,746
- 乐意之至  - 很好 走吧
- Gladly.  - Oh, good, go.

227
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:31,847
你知道 如果能
You know, it'll be nice

228
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,616
看完一整集都没有人一直啰嗦
to watch an episode without someone saying,

229
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:34,784
我看过书了
"I read the books.

230
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:37,420
别对这个角色付出太多感情
Don't get too fond of this character."

231
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:39,655
这不代表他们最后翘辫子了
It's not always because they die.

232
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:41,591
举个例子 是因为这些角色在凛冬将至时
In one case, it's because they've become involved

233
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,492
就和地底的森林之子产生了联系
with underground tree people from the dawn of time.

234
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:45,227
哼 就不告诉你是谁
Yeah, but I won't say who it is.

235
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:46,362
没错 就是Bran!
It's Bran!

236
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,732
这是怎么了?
Wait, what is going on?

237
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,734
Leonard是个混蛋 所以我们决定去这边看
Leonard's being a jerk, so we're gonna watch over here,

238
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:53,269
你们要和我们一起吗?
Do you guys want to watch with us?

239
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:54,870
只要不和这货一起看就行
As long as I don't have to watch with him.

240
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:56,505
很好 我也不想和你一起看
Fine, I don't want to watch with you either.

241
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:57,473
我去那边了
I'll go over here.

242
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,741
谁说你可以先选了?
Why do you get to pick?

243
00:09:58,743 --> 00:09:59,875
行啊 那你过去!
Okay, then you go there!

244
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:02,244
我去哪边还用不着你指手画脚!
Don't tell me where to go!

245
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:03,713
Howard 进来吧
Howard, just come in here.

246
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,481
来这边 Raj
Yeah, come on, Raj.

247
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,650
等一下 Amy做了她拿手的菠菜酱了吗?
Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?

248
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:08,651
她做了
She did.

249
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,720
我连渣儿都不会给你剩!
And I'm gonna eat it all!

250
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,864
到底是什么情况啊?
So what the hell happened?

251
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,167
只不过是我实在没耐心去应付Sheldon的无理取闹罢了
Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon's nonsense.

252
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,869
深有体会 我也受不了Raj了
Tell me about it. I've had it with Raj, too.

253
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:31,006
就像女人一样 男人每个月也总有那么几天
You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle.

254
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:33,141
睾丸素的分泌下降会导致情绪反复无常
Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.

255
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:34,643
有意思
Interesting.

256
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:39,414
说不定我的男性周期和Raj的大姨妈同步了呢
Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj's actual period.

257
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:44,553
如果Sheldon的睾丸素分泌再下降 他就上天了
If Sheldon's testosterone dipped, he'd become a butterfly.

258
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:47,589
瞧瞧
Oh.

259
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:50,459
看来是有人知道自己错了呢
Maybe someone's here to apologize.

260
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:52,995
嘿 Leonard
Hey, Leonard.

261
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:55,998
Stuart你好
Stuart.

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,066
额...
Uh...

263
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:02,571
这不是化妆派对啊?
Is this not a dress-up party?

264
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:04,339
不是
No.

265
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:09,311
本来也不是的哈?
Was it ever a dress-up party?

266
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,713
不是
No.

267
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:14,950
Howard 你不是告诉我这是化妆派对吗?
Howard, didn't you tell me it was a dress-up party?

268
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:17,486
我是这么说的
Yeah.

269
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:30,999
他们说如果不爽Howard就到这里来
I was told this is where to go if I'm mad at Howard.

270
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,571
你要脱掉你的斗篷吗?
May I take your cloak?

271
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:38,206
谢谢
Thanks.

272
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:42,044
这玩意儿一直铰在我自行车的链条里
This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.

273
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:44,379
我给你补充下背景知识
Well, I'll catch you up.

274
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:47,382
Penny不爽Leonard Leonard不爽我和Penny
Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard's angry at me and Penny,

275
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,051
我对Leonard和Amy不爽
I'm angry at Leonard and Amy,

276
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,619
Raj对Howard不爽
Raj is angry at Howard,

277
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:52,821
我还很不爽George R.R. Martin
and I'm angry at George R.R. Martin

278
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:55,624
因为他没有新书可以让我剧透给Leonard
'cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.

279
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:59,394
你和Howard之间怎么了?
So what happened with you and Howard?

280
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:00,896
他说我一直说和Claire和
Says I was talking too much

281
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:02,230
Emily同时约会的事情
about dating Claire and Emily,

282
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:04,666
我还说他是在嫉妒我
and I accused him of being jealous.

283
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,134
人家很眼红啊
I'm jealous.

284
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:07,736
最接近我和两个女人同时约会的时候
Closest I've come to dating two women

285
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:10,338
就是我和一个女人约会的时候
was that time I dated one woman.

286
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,445
我不知道你怎么受得了
I don't know how you put up with it.

287
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,447
他简直不可理喻 想想看 就连决定
He's impossible. I mean, holding a meeting

288
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:21,283
我们究竟要买哪种早餐麦片都要开会
to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.

289
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:24,986
就是说 当然是Cap'n Crunch和Crunch Berries 下一项
Yeah. Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.

290
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:28,890
无论怎样 Amy 谢谢你站在我这边
Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.

291
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:32,260
说实在的 姐一点都不在乎
Oh, I honestly couldn't care less.

292
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:33,995
啥?
Sorry?

293
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:36,298
我站在你这边纯粹是因为我对Sheldon和Penny
Well, I just took your side 'cause sometimes I get annoyed

294
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,866
走得太近而不爽
at how close Sheldon and Penny are.

295
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:40,869
他们一直吵来吵去的
Well, they argue all the time.

296
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:42,104
也没那么亲近啦
They aren't that close.

297
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:44,272
那他失落的时候是谁一直在安慰他?
Who's always comforting him when he's upset?

298
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:46,441
是Penny没错 但... 那又只有谁
Penny, but... Who's the only one

299
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:48,210
可以让他在生病的时候乖乖吃药?
who can make him take his medicine when he's sick?

300
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:50,178
我试过把药藏在他的花生酱里
I try to hide it in his peanut butter,

301
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,047
但他吐出来了
but he spits it out.

302
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:54,850
好嘛
Okay.

303
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:56,752
你知道Penny让Sheldon
And did you know she has him add things

304
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,987
往室友条例里加条款 这样她就能想干嘛干嘛
to the Roommate Agreement so she can get her way

305
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:00,989
而不用和你争辩吗?
and not fight with you about it?

306
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,258
这个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

307
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:10,265
这有啥好笑的?
Why is that funny?

308
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,300
我也不知道 我喜欢看着别人受苦
I don't know. I like the pain of others.

309
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:16,671
那好 你应该会喜欢这个
Oh, well, then you'll enjoy this.

310
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:19,608
Bernadette对你和Koothrappali做了同样的事
Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.

311
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,575
才没有
No, she doesn't.

312
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:22,477
她一直为他辩护
She defends him all the time.

313
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,779
才不是
She does not.

314
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,080
是谁告诉你
Who told you to stop making

315
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:27,215
不要对他讲各种甘地笑话的?
all those Gandhi jokes about him?

316
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:29,885
这确实是她说的
Well, she did.

317
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,454
人力资源部也和我说过
And human resources.

318
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,258
你觉得是谁告诉Koothrappali
Who do you think told Koothrappali

319
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,126
去找人力资源部的?
to go to human resources?

320
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,930
这个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

321
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,668
你太对了 感觉真好
You're right, it feels good.

322
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:51,840
嗯 游戏时间到了
All right, it's almost game time.

323
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:52,808
懂了吗?
Get it?

324
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,610
权利的游戏 游戏时间?
Game of Thrones, game time?

325
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,681
两个女人 是吧?
Two women, huh?

326
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,153
看来Amy是想明白了
Oh, perhaps it's Amy coming to her senses.

327
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:08,557
- 怎么了?  - 你知道
- What's up?  - You know,

328
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,592
你不需要通过Sheldon那傻瓜室友条例
you don't need to use Sheldon to get your way with me

329
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:11,827
来绕过我吧?
in a dumb Roommate Agreement.

330
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:12,761
你从哪知道的?
Where'd you get that from?

331
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:13,695
Amy说的
From Amy.

332
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:16,264
呃 Amy 你为啥告诉他这个?
Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?

333
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:19,434
因为你和往常一样袒护Sheldon
Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.

334
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:20,769
我平常才不袒护Sheldon呢
I don't always defend Sheldon.

335
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,771
你当然袒护他 你知道你和他有种奇怪的
Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird

336
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:25,774
{\an8}梗来自电影E.T外星人 本片中男主和他的兄妹们联手帮外星人找回了家

337
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:25,774
兄妹外星关系
brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.

338
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:28,710
那你和他奇怪的关系呢?
What about your weird relationship with him?

339
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:29,744
这是另一码事
That's different.

340
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,213
我是鬼驱人里面那个小女孩
I'm like the little girl in Poltergeist

341
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:33,248
他是电视里那个可怕的东西
and he's the creepy thing in the TV.

342
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,884
各位
Um, guys?

343
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:38,186
食物里面有坚果吗?
Were there any nuts in that food?

344
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:40,188
- 应该没有吧 怎么了?  - 嗯...
- I don't think so. Why?  - Well...

345
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,991
只是感觉不大对头
Just a feeling.

346
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,436
上面只写着"意大利三明治"
It just said "Italian sub."

347
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:57,505
我完全不知道摩泰台拉香肚(一种熏香肠)里面有开心果
I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.

348
00:14:57,507 --> 00:14:59,774
小知识:
Interesting fact:

349
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:04,246
在意大利语里 "摩泰台拉香肚"里的"摩泰"意思是死亡
In Italian, the "morta" in "mortadella" means death.

350
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,749
Sheldon啊
Sheldon.

351
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,519
我又没说"趣味小知识" 我不是怪物
I didn't say "fun" fact. I'm not a monster.

352
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,488
他会没事的
He's gonna be okay.

353
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:17,158
现在就是趣味小知识了
Now it's a fun fact.

354
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,595
天啊 这种事情发生真的让你好好思考人生啊
Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.

355
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:22,297
你为啥穿成这样?
Why are you dressed like that?

356
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:25,200
呃 Howard觉得告诉我这是化妆派对
Oh, uh, Howard thought it'd be funny

357
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:27,235
是件有趣的事
to tell me it was a costume party.

358
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:28,770
这可不好
That wasn't nice.

359
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:32,607
确实 不过他都快死了 我俩两清了吧
No, but he almost died, so we're cool.

360
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:37,178
其实 你仔细想想 今晚就像是
You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like

361
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,281
现实版的权利的游戏
a real-life Game of Thrones.

362
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:40,282
怎么像?
How?

363
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,617
Howard吃了开心果
Well, Howard eating that pistachio

364
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,786
就像乔佛瑞国王被毒死了
was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.

365
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:47,222
那是谋杀 这是意外
Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.

366
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:48,189
好吧
Okay.

367
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:50,525
但你利用Sheldon
But you using Sheldon

368
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,561
暗箱操作就像瑟曦
to do your dirty work is like when Cersei

369
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:55,297
利用国王的守卫来垂帘听政一样
used the King's Guard to do her bidding.

370
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,600
瑟曦用肉体操纵别人
Cersei uses her body to manipulate men.

371
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:01,369
Penny只是带我去了乐高玩具店
Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.

372
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:04,806
那这样呢?
Okay. Oh, how about this?

373
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:07,642
Stuart穿得就像守夜人军团
Stuart's dressed like a brother of the Night's Watch,

374
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:09,477
而且他们不啪啪啪
and they don't have sex.

375
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,478
- 说到点子上了  - 没错
- There you go.  - That's true.

376
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,110
嘿
Hey.

377
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:15,315
嘿 你还好吗?
Hey. You all right?

378
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:16,849
我很好
I'm fine.

379
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,384
就是觉得被当个婴儿从楼梯上抬下来
Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs

380
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:20,452
有些尴尬
like a baby.

381
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:21,987
谢谢
Thanks.

382
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:25,624
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

383
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:27,159
太吓人了
That was scary.

384
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:28,560
重要的是
Well, the important thing is

385
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:30,596
我之前就说这个大三明治会毁了一切的
I said that big sandwich would ruin everything,

386
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,431
我说对了
and I was right.

387
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,370
嘿 琼恩·雪诺!
Hey, Jon Snow!

388
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,607
你的马上为啥有个筐子?
How come your horse has a basket on it?

389
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,845
你的头上怎么有一张脸?
How come your head has your face on it?

390
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,517
权力的游戏里他们不戴自行车头盔
They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones.

391
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,585
你的主题不对
You're thematically inaccurate,

392
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:57,289
但我为你的安全意识鼓掌
but I applaud your commitment to safety.

393
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,325
你们就没些更好的事做吗?
Don't you guys have anything better to do?

394
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:02,694
比看一个穿着毛皮斗篷的男人
Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak

395
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:06,064
骑一辆女自行车还好的? 没有了
ride a girl's bike?  Nope.

396
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,768
就这样了 你才失去了你在漫画店的
That's it, you just lost bathroom privileges

397
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,371
厕所特权
at the comic book store.

398
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:19,411
有筐子的马 真蠢...
Horse has a basket on it. Stupid...

399
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,346
Leonard啊
Leonard.

400
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:37,482
Leonard Leonard啊
Leonard. Leonard.

401
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,284
什么事?
What?

402
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:42,220
我那关于蝙蝠侠的问题还没问呢
I never got to ask my question about Batman.

403
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:46,124
啥问题?
What is it?

404
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:49,661
如果蝙蝠侠被一个放射性侠蝙蝠咬了
If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat,

405
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:53,365
并假扮侠蝙蝠和罪犯斗争
and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat,

406
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:56,501
是应该叫他人形侠蝙蝠蝙蝠侠
would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man

407
00:17:56,503 --> 00:18:00,171
还是只是侠蝙蝠人形蝙蝠侠就好?
or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?

408
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:06,845
他侠蝙蝠衣服里面有蝙蝠侠衣服吗?
Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?

409
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,814
我马上回来
I'll be back.
