1
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:51,273
(THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENT)

2
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,992
(FINAL WHISTLE BLOWS)

3
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,629
- Coming for a drink in the board room, Jim?
- Thanks.

4
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:18,710
Ah, well, better enjoy it while the club's still here.

5
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,837
- We've always survived.
- It's different this time.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,073
- Tell him, Brian.
- We've had a meeting of the finance committee.

7
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,152
Aston Wanderers will have to call in the Receiver!

8
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,790
- You mean bankrupt?
- The final whistle.

9
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,478
- We need one-and-a-half million quid, Jim.
- The government waste that every 30 seconds!

10
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:44,076
- Oh, I say!
- You know what people are saying, Jim?

11
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,951
It's no good having a Cabinet Minister for an MP.
Better a local lad with time for his constituency.

12
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,599
- That's absurd!
- Why?

13
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,754
- There are advantages if an MP's in the Cabinet.
- We haven't noticed them, have we, Harry?

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,469
- Such as?
- It reflects well on the constituency.

15
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:05,918
It's good to have powerful friends,
influence in high places, a friend in need...

16
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,435
Listen, friend, what we need
is one-and-a-half million quid!

17
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:11,758
Ah.

18
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,274
So will you use that influence to help us?

19
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:18,512
Well, when I said influence,
I meant the indefinable sort,

20
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:22,876
the intangible, subtle benefit

21
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,793
of an input into broad general policy
at its early stages

22
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,679
while keeping constituency interests in mind.

23
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,829
Do you mean no?

24
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,433
Well, anything I can do in a broad, general sense
to further the cause, I will certainly...

25
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:40,031
...er, do.

26
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:46,031
If I can. But for a minister to pump
one-and-a-half million into his local football club!

27
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,790
He means no.

28
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,429
But there'd be lots of votes in it.
You'd be the hero of the constituency.

29
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:56,796
"Jim Hacker, the man who saved
Aston Wanderers!" Safe seat for life!

30
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,746
That might occur to the press.
And the opposition. And the judge!

31
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:04,991
If this club goes to the wall it'll be a disaster.
Look at our history!

32
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,754
FA Cup winners, League Champions,
first team into Europe.

33
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,834
I know all that, but be fair.
It's a local matter, not a ministerial one.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,991
As chair of the Arts and Leisure Committee,
can you help?

35
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,789
Me? You're joking. I spent half of yesterday
trying to raise 711 quid

36
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,631
to repoint the chimney on the art gallery.

37
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,030
That miserable place? Why not let it fall down?

38
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,954
I'd love to, but if it fell on somebody,
the Council's liable. We own the bloody place!

39
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,758
And we keep getting offers for the site.

40
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,955
Savefair Supermarkets were after it last month.

41
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,792
Hold on, how much were they offering?

42
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,112
About two million quid, I think.

43
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:49,157
If you sold the art gallery,
you could save the football club.

44
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:52,914
- There'd have to be a planning enquiry.
- Can we see it?

45
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,876
We'll have to be quick. They close at five.

46
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,147
- Hideous, isn't it?
- It's a Grade II listed building.

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,995
Bernard, what is our political master up to
with the Corn Exchange Art Gallery?

48
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:34,233
- Oh, er, how did you find out about that?
- Not from you, Bernard.

49
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,992
An omission you may care to explain.

50
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,634
- Surely it's just a constituency matter?
- Surely not.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,836
Selling the gallery to Savefair Supermarkets

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,790
and giving an interest-free loan to Aston
Wanderers, he's acting as an MP not a minister.

53
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,950
It is the principle, Bernard.

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,555
Have you thought what the effect would be
if this happens?

55
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:59,027
- He'd be very popular.
- Exactly!

56
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,276
Distressingly popular.
Hideously popular. And then?

57
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:10,911
- The minister would be re-elected.
- And that is not our top priority.

58
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,152
In this department,
it makes little difference who the minister is.

59
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,108
But the point is, suppose other football clubs
got into difficulties?

60
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:25,875
And what about greyhound racing? Should dog
tracks be subsidised as well as football clubs?

61
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,031
- Why not, if that's what the people want?
- Bernard...

62
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,237
...subsidy...

63
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:36,908
...is for art, for culture.

64
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,510
It is not to be given to what the people want!

65
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,675
It is for what the people don't want
but ought to have!

66
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,269
If they want something
they'll pay for it themselves!

67
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:57,594
No, we subsidise education,
enlightenment, spiritual uplift.

68
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,397
Not the vulgar pastimes of ordinary people.

69
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:02,947
It's the thin end of the wedge.
It must be stopped!

70
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:09,790
- Ah, Minister.
- Humphrey. What's the matter now?

71
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,112
Minister, I thought you'd like early warning
that there's a reshuffle in the offing.

72
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:17,588
(HE GASPS)

73
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,072
- You don't mean... You're not suggesting...
- No, no, no, Minister.

74
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:25,754
There is to be a departmental reorganisation.

75
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,194
A real reshuffle.

76
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:31,271
- We may get extra responsibilities.
- Do we want them?

77
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:36,353
We want all responsibilities, Minister,
if they mean extra staff and bigger budgets.

78
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:42,197
It's the breadth of our responsibilities that makes
us important, makes YOU important, Minister.

79
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:47,830
When you see vast buildings, huge staff
and massive budgets, what do you conclude?

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,990
Bureaucracy?

81
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:55,632
No, Minister, you conclude that at the summit

82
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,555
there are men of great stature and dignity
who hold the world in their hands

83
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,027
and tread the earth like princes.

84
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,552
Yes, I see.

85
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,394
So each new responsibility
must be seized eagerly

86
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:14,027
and each old one guarded jealously.

87
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,067
- Entirely in your interests, of course, Minister.
- Thank you for warning me, Humphrey.

88
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,354
Thank you, Minister.

89
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,630
Oh! By the way...

90
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,156
- About the Corn Exchange Art Gallery proposal.
- What about it?

91
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,550
It's the most imaginative scheme, novel idea,

92
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:38,870
- but I wonder if it might not be a little unwise?
- Why?

93
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,951
- A valuable civic amenity.
- A monstrosity!

94
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,673
A valuable civic monstrosity.

95
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:51,112
- An important collection of British paintings.
- Utterly unimportant.

96
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:54,954
Second-rate 18th-century portraits,
third-rate 19th-century landscapes,

97
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,111
modern paintings the Tate wouldn't even store.

98
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:02,192
But an important representative collection
of unimportant paintings.

99
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:06,272
And a source of great spiritual uplift
to passing citizenry.

100
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:09,476
- They never go in!
- But they know it's there.

101
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,233
The curator says they average 11 visitors a day!

102
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,550
It's a constituency matter. Nothing to do
with Whitehall. What's your interest?

103
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,152
- A question of principle.
- Principle?

104
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,312
What you used to tell me politics was about.

105
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:27,790
- What principle?
- The principle of taking money away from the arts

106
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,836
and putting it into football.

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,756
A football club is a commercial operation. There's
no cause for subsidy if it runs out of money.

108
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,353
- Why not?
- Why not?

109
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,148
Yes. There's no difference
between subsidising football and art.

110
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,153
Except more people are interested in football.

111
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:48,153
- Our cultural heritage has to be preserved.
- For whom?

112
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,598
For people like you, you mean,
the educated middle classes.

113
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,594
Why should others subsidise
the pleasures of the middle-class few?

114
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,273
Theatre, opera, ballet!

115
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:05,787
- Subsidising art is a middle-class rip-off.
- Oh, Minister, how can you say such a thing?

116
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,430
Subsidy is about education,
preserving the pinnacles of our civilisation.

117
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:14,639
- Or hadn't you noticed?
- Don't patronise me. I believe in education.

118
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,237
I'm a graduate of the London School
of Economics, remember.

119
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,314
I'm glad to learn that even the LSE
is not totally opposed to education.

120
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:28,629
Nothing wrong with subsidising sport.
Sport is educational.

121
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,109
We have sex education too.
Should we subsidise sex?

122
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:33,632
Could we?

123
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,036
Let us choose what we subsidise
by the extent of popular demand.

124
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,193
- Nothing wrong with that. It's democratic.
- It's the thin end of the wedge!

125
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:50,593
What would happen to the Royal Opera House,
the very summit of our cultural achievement?

126
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:56,117
Very good case in point. What do they do?
Mozart, Wagner, Verdi, Puccini.

127
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,634
Germans and Italians, not our culture.

128
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,638
Why should we subsidise the culture
of the Axis powers?

129
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,552
Our European partners, Minister!

130
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,634
The Royal Opera House gets nine-and-a-half
million pounds of public money every year.

131
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,670
And for what? The public can't afford £30 seats
and if it could there aren't enough of them.

132
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,956
The vast majority of the audience consists
of big business executives

133
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,910
block-booked by the banks and oil companies
and multinationals and people like you.

134
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,389
The Royal Opera House
is the establishment at play.

135
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:37,270
Why should the working man pay for the gentry
who can perfectly well afford their own seats?

136
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,751
Minister, I'm quite frankly appalled.
This is savagery, barbarism.

137
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,430
That a Minister of the Crown should say such
things, it's the end of civilisation as we know it,

138
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,194
- as well as being a gross distortion of the truth.
- Distortion?

139
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:58,398
- Art cannot survive without public subsidy.
- Did Shakespeare get a subsidy?

140
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,317
And films? Films are art and educational. Why
does the establishment ignore their subsidy?

141
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,993
Because people like you prefer opera.

142
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,870
We should subsidise relevant art
like films that the man in the street can enjoy.

143
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,474
Precisely! They are commercial.

144
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,073
Now, excuse me, I have to go early. I cannot
continue with this appalling discussion.

145
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:23,549
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

146
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,109
Well, I'm sorry. We must talk this through.

147
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,554
I can't. I have to dress.

148
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,552
Dress? Where are you going?

149
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,153
Since you insist,
I am going to the Royal Opera House.

150
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,916
Are you really?

151
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,590
Gala night, is it?

152
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,791
- Yes, it is, since you ask.
- Lots of Permanent Secretaries going?

153
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,109
Some, no doubt.

154
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,509
- Off you go, then.
- Thank you.

155
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,069
I don't want to make you late
for your works' outing!

156
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,398
That's what it is, isn't it? What's on tonight?

157
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,868
The Flying Dutchman.

158
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,917
Another of our European partners!

159
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,950
- G&T, lan?
- Thanks.

160
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,997
Two G&Ts, please, large ones.

161
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,473
And some of those smoked salmon sandwiches
you have. Thank you very much.

162
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,748
- So, how's the environment?
- Bit smoky, isn't it?

163
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,554
Oh, you mean my department? Chaos, as usual.

164
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,076
- What, the Secretary of State is trying to run it?
- I could cope with that.

165
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:46,197
One of the junior ministers is trying to help him.

166
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,475
Oh, Lord. Who?

167
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,917
- Giles Freeman, the Parli Sec.
- Oh, Lord, him?

168
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,278
- Anyhow, what do you want to talk about?
- A planning enquiry.

169
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,748
Important we get the right result.

170
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,071
My planning inspectors
are absolutely independent.

171
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,595
- Absolutely.
- No undue influence.

172
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,038
No, no, I wouldn't suggest it. But if it's a
question of giving certain informal guidelines...

173
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,953
- Putting the enquiry into perspective.
- Yes, indeed.

174
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,875
Explaining the background to facilitate
an appreciation of the issues and implications.

175
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,634
- That would be quite proper.
- Splendid.

176
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,153
- Ah.
- Thank you very much.

177
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,232
Er, right. Thank you very much.

178
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,238
Cheers.

179
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,392
So what do you want me to fix?

180
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,358
It's an art gallery in the West Midlands.
Proposed demolition of a Grade II listed building.

181
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,196
- I'm sure we can arrange that. Only too happy.
- Splendid.

182
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,352
We're knocking them down all over the place.

183
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,478
No, no, the proposal has to be rejected.

184
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,714
Really? Why?

185
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:03,830
If it goes through, they'll use the proceeds
to save the local football club from bankruptcy.

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,639
- Humphrey...
- I know.

187
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:13,429
If once you allow the principle of money being
taken from the arts and given to ordinary people...

188
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,915
...to enjoy themselves!

189
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,590
- I agree.
- Where will it end?

190
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,078
Exactly.

191
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,194
- Where did this appalling idea come from?
- My lord and master.

192
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:30,634
He's getting very het up
over the sweaty masses.

193
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,237
- Didn't you stop him? What were you thinking of?
- It's not me. It's his constituency.

194
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,711
Apparently he put it to a group of councillors
last Saturday and they jumped at it.

195
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,235
I've always said
we shouldn't let him out at weekends!

196
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,234
He only causes trouble.
You realise where this could lead?

197
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,189
Today a Midlands art gallery goes
to support the local football club,

198
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:58,557
tomorrow the Royal Opera House grant goes
to modernise Wembley Stadium.

199
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,349
My point exactly. So I can trust you
to keep an eye on the planning enquiry?

200
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,751
- Well, I can't influence the inspector...
- 'Course not.

201
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,434
But I'll put someone on it
who's overdue for promotion.

202
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,956
Good. You'll give him
a thorough briefing, won't you?

203
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,157
Oh, I'm sure he will see the real issue.

204
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,188
Civilisation versus barbarism.

205
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,509
We can't have arts money going to popular
sport. It's simply subsidising self-indulgence.

206
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,158
Exactly.

207
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,955
Minister, before we go over today's diary, there's
something I'd like to suggest, if I may be so bold.

208
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,318
- Be as bold as you like.
- Well, I feel, and I say this with respect,

209
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:44,153
you shouldn't get too involved
with this football club affair.

210
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,073
That is bold, isn't it? It's a constituency matter.

211
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,392
Better for me to be "bold"
than you to be stumped, Minister!

212
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,117
Very droll.

213
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,158
It's axiomatic in Whitehall that even an MP,
let alone a minister,

214
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,233
should never take part in a planning enquiry
in his own constituency.

215
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,312
- Why not?
- Because of finely-balanced local issues.

216
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:09,836
You'll offend as many constituents
as you'll please.

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,470
It's especially dangerous
if there's a quango in the wings.

218
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,519
No. Issues aren't finely-balanced.
Everyone's on the same side,

219
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,432
except a few wet, long-haired scruffy art lovers!

220
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,471
We'll take a look at your diary for this morning.

221
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,278
Oh, fine.

222
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:32,069
10.15, Secretary General of the Arts Council,
the biggest quango of all.

223
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:36,198
10.45, Historic Monuments Association,
11.00, The National Trust.

224
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:41,036
11.15, Country Landowners Association,
11.30, Council for Protection of Rural England...

225
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,112
- Rural England?
- There's quite a lot of it out there!

226
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,831
- Why are all these people coming to see me?
- The art gallery, Minister.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,752
It's the arts and architecture mafia.

228
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,429
- 11.45, the Country Crafts and Folklore Council.
- Who are they?

229
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,908
The raffia mafia.

230
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,593
Influential people coming out of the woodwork.

231
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,754
There'll be letters in The Times, hostile articles
in the Sundays, you'll be called a vandal.

232
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,116
They'll orchestrate opposition
in your constituency.

233
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:20,478
Why did you put them in my diary?
I didn't ask you to. What were you thinking?

234
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,076
- I was thinking of Sir Humphrey. He asked me to.
- No.

235
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,959
I'm going to support this excellent scheme,
come what may.

236
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,834
As you will. May I just have your approval for
this local government allowances amendment?

237
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:39,278
It's a statutory instrument
to go before the House.

238
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:43,875
As Minister for Local Government,
you need to authorise that revised paragraph 5,

239
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,192
Number 2 regulation 1971
shall come into operation on March 18th,

240
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:54,276
revoking regulation 7 of the local government
allowances amendment regulations 1954b.

241
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,595
What the hell's all that mean?

242
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,989
There is an explanatory note.

243
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,196
"These regulations make provision

244
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:07,149
"for prescribing allowances payable
to members of local authorities.

245
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:13,394
"Explanatory note, regulation 3 of the local
government allowances amendment (1971)

246
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,755
"(the 1971 regulations)

247
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,959
"Substituted a new regulation for regulation 3
of the 1954 regulations.

248
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,477
"Regulation 3 of the local government
allowances amendment regulations 1972,

249
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:29,509
"(the 1972 regulations) further made amends
regulation 3 of the 1954 regulations

250
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,831
"by increasing the maximum rates of attendance
and financial loss allowances."

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,674
- I haven't the faintest...
- "Regulation 7, 1982,

252
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,072
"revoked both regulations 3 and 5
of the 1971 regulations,

253
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:47,394
"regulation 5 being a regulation revoking
earlier spent regulations,

254
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:49,914
"with effect from 1st April next.

255
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,836
"These regulations preserve regulations 3 and 5
of the 1971 regulations

256
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,276
"by revoking regulation 7 of the 1972 regulations."

257
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,035
That's an explanatory note?

258
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,153
Yes, I think that's all quite clear.

259
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:12,231
Why must I listen to this piddling gobbledegook?

260
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,832
I thought it would be an opportune moment
for you to ensure

261
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,471
that as a result of your ministerial efforts, local
councillors will get more for attending meetings.

262
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:26,518
- Oh, is that what it means?
- Yes.

263
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,796
Excellent. It is, as you say, opportune.

264
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,919
- And may I make one further small suggestion?
- Be my guest.

265
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,432
Sir Humphrey had a word
with Sir lan Whitworth last night.

266
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:43,831
- Lan Whitworth!
- The Corn Exchange is a listed building,

267
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,434
so one of his planning inspectors
will conduct the enquiry.

268
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:51,558
Sir Humphrey and Sir lan will give him
some informal guidelines.

269
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,357
How do you mean, "informal guidelines"?

270
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,875
Guidelines are perfectly proper.
Everyone has guidelines for their work.

271
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,591
I thought planning inspectors were impartial?

272
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,635
Oh, really, Minister!

273
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,790
So they are. Railway trains are impartial too.

274
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,396
But if you lay down the lines for them,
that's the way they go!

275
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,197
- But that's not fair!
- It's politics, Minister.

276
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:21,797
What has Sir Humphrey got to do with politics?
He's a civil servant. I'm the one in politics!

277
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,028
Yes, Minister, indeed you are!

278
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:29,313
How do they intend to put pressure
on this planning inspector?

279
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,676
Planning inspectors
have an independent hierarchy.

280
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,956
A vulnerable one is one anxious for promotion.

281
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,317
How are planning inspectors chosen
for an enquiry? Could a minister interfere?

282
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:46,188
- Ministers are our lords and masters.
- Good.

283
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:51,629
The Parli Sec at the Department of the
Environment is an old friend, Giles Freeman.

284
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,554
Well, if Mr Freeman could arrange for an
inspector who didn't care about promotion,

285
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,232
if, for instance, he's about to retire,

286
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:04,109
he'll probably reach a verdict favouring
the community rather than the department.

287
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,671
Good! Get me Giles on the phone, would you?

288
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,515
His Private Secretary says he can meet you
in the lobby after the vote this evening.

289
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,555
Bernard, have you ever thought
of going into politics?

290
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:23,795
- Oh, no, Minister.
- Why not?

291
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,429
- I once looked it up in my thesaurus.
- What did it say?

292
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:31,672
Manipulation, intrigue, wire-pulling,
evasion, graft, rabble-rousing...

293
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,831
I'd prefer to leave that to our lords and masters.

294
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,594
I don't think I have the necessary qualities.

295
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,756
Don't underestimate yourself, Bernard!

296
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,913
Now it seems Hacker has got at Giles Freeman,
the Parli Sec in my department,

297
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,278
who insisted on appointing a different
planning inspector to the one I chose!

298
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:55,431
One who'd be sympathetic to Hacker's scheme.

299
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:58,831
- This is rather worrying.
- Worrying? It's desperate!

300
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,518
There's now every danger that the planning
inspector could make up his own mind!

301
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,315
There's likely to be huge local support
for the scheme.

302
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:14,634
- But how can I help?
- I hoped you'd have some ideas, Arnold.

303
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,192
Wait a minute! I've thought of something.

304
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:24,510
When the departmental reorganisation
occurs next week...

305
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,151
...you could make Hacker
Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts!

306
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,269
- But isn't he a complete philistine?
- Yes.

307
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,112
But then the Industry Secretary
is the idlest man in town.

308
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,313
The Education Secretary is illiterate!

309
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,638
The Employment Secretary is unemployable!

310
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,631
Quite. That's good thinking, Humphrey.

311
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,795
Hacker can hardly start out as Cabinet Minister
for the arts by closing down an art gallery.

312
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,679
- Exactly.
- But it's not a reshuffle, is it?

313
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,834
No, I simply meant reorganise.
Move the arts and telecommunications

314
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,639
into the purview of the DAA.

315
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,597
Arts and television together?

316
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,638
What have they got to do with each other?

317
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,075
They're complete opposites.

318
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:28,757
Wouldn't we be creating a monster department?
You've already got local government as well.

319
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,991
- Arts and local government go well together.
- How so?

320
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,632
Well, the art of jiggery-pokery!

321
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,229
You only just thought of this
here and now, did you?

322
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:47,911
- Yes, why?
- Bit of an artist yourself, aren't you?

323
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:50,396
Oh, Arnold!

324
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,757
- Anything more, Bernard?
- Sir Humphrey wants a word

325
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,672
before your meeting about Aston Wanderers.

326
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,229
But I'm unshakeable on that!

327
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,674
It's no good, Humphrey, my mind is made up.

328
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,879
You might be interested in a new development,
the government reshuffle.

329
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,555
- You said it was just a reorganisation.
- Not JUST a reorganisation.

330
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,107
A reorganisation.

331
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:21,951
I'm delighted to tell you that it has brought us,
brought YOU, new honour and importance.

332
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:29,196
In addition to existing responsibilities, you will
be Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts.

333
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,674
I say, that's rather good, isn't it!
Hold on, how do you know before I do?

334
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,834
I just happened to be with the Cabinet Secretary
shortly after the decision was taken.

335
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,398
I see.

336
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,551
Cabinet Minister with responsibility for the arts!

337
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,188
- Well, well, well!
- Yes, indeed.

338
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,032
Anything more? I'm about to start a meeting.

339
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,679
Oh, the meeting, yes.

340
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,437
I do hope you've considered the implications
of your new appointment on the subject.

341
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:05,716
- Rescuing a football club?
- No, no.

342
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,350
I was wondering how it would look
if as Minister responsible for the arts,

343
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:13,192
your first act was to knock down an art gallery.

344
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,634
It's quite a decent little art gallery...

345
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:35,390
- Exactly.
- Interesting building.

346
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:38,551
- Grade II listed.
- Minister, your meeting...

347
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,269
Oh, my God! What am I going to say?

348
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:48,750
- Councillors Wilkinson, Noble and Green.
- Brian, good to see you.

349
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,229
Pete... Doug.

350
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,392
Sir Humphrey Appleby, my Permanent Secretary.

351
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,232
You mean he's only a temp!

352
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,795
It's going great, Jim. We've got all the political
parties with us and the County Council.

353
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,635
All we need is your approval for using the sale
of the art gallery as a loan to the club.

354
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:15,197
Well, I'm afraid there's a snag.

355
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,998
- You said there weren't any!
- Well, there is.

356
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,947
Well, it's just that... Well...

357
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,473
It appears... Well, it seems...

358
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,513
Well, I should say it has emerged...

359
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,759
Sir Humphrey can explain better than me.

360
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,597
It can't be done, gentlemen.
Er, the art gallery is... It's a trust.

361
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,514
- Terms of the original bequest.
- Yes, it's a trust.

362
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,557
We shall have to knock something else down!

363
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,917
School, church, hospital...
There's bound to be something!

364
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,790
I can't believe this. So I have to tell people
back home you've gone back on your word?

365
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,792
- It was your own idea!
- It's not me, it's the law.

366
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,792
Why didn't you find out till now?

367
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,558
- Well...
- A-hem.

368
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,553
Let me be absolutely frank with you.

369
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,634
The truth is, it would be possible
to push this through, just possible,

370
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,759
- but it would take an awful long time.
- OK, we've spent enough.

371
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,356
Trouble is, something else
would have to go by the board.

372
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,957
The thing that's taking my time at the moment
is forcing through councillors' expenses

373
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,713
and attendance allowances.

374
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,433
I can't put my personal weight
behind both schemes.

375
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:56,509
I suppose I could forget about
the increased allowances for councillors

376
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,797
and concentrate on the legal obstacles,
the sale of the art gallery.

377
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,478
- Tricky things, legal obstacles.
- This is a particularly tricky one.

378
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,232
At the end of the day, you might still fail.

379
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,754
- Every possibility.
- If that's the way it is...

380
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,232
there's a chance we might want to close
Edgehill primary at the end of the year...

381
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,789
That site would fetch
a couple of million, give or take.

382
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,747
Well, there it is, then. No ill feelings to you.

383
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,515
Good. And you'll explain locally
that we can't overcome the legal obstacles?

384
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,036
'Course we will. Carry on with the good work!

385
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:45,075
Oh, Minister, a work of art.

386
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,750
- If you'll excuse me, I have to dress.
- Another works' outing?

387
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:59,192
- Er, Humphrey...
- Minister?

388
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,875
- As Cabinet Minister responsible for the arts...
- Hmm?

389
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,120
...could I come too?

390
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:11,153
Yes, Minister!

391
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:29,321
