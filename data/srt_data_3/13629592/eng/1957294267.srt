OnWhy Women Kill...

2
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,746
I've been accepted
into the Garden Club.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,096
You shouldn't be here.

4
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:11,011
I was invited. I-I'm
the new member.

5
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:12,099
No, we-we voted.

6
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:13,578
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:16,277
I am so terribly
sorry for the mix-up.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,583
Rita deliberately
humiliated me today.

9
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:19,889
Is that Rita?

10
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:21,214
- Do you know her?
- What Rita did...

11
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:22,761
It's not 'cause she hates you.

12
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,546
- It's 'cause she hates me.

13
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,504
Good morning,
it's Dr. Rice.

14
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:29,159
Are you aware you're pregnant?

15
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:30,508
I'm his girl.

16
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:32,075
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,208
You murdered 26 people?!

18
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:37,428
You've got to stop this
madness. Promise me.

19
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,864
I think this is what Alma was

20
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:40,779
- talking to me about.
- Listen to her.

21
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:43,782
Why are you so anxious to spend
time with an old lady like me?

22
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,866
You're a dame who doesn't
know how beautiful she is.

23
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:48,981
Oh, Papa, you must
be getting your strength back.

24
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,417
I think he's
pointing at something.

25
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,922
He couldn't possibly.

26
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,212
Is there
something on the board?

27
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:58,275
Oh! Ah!

28
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,557
You can trust
me with your secrets.

29
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,409
You and Scooter.

30
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,324
No one will hear a
word about it from me.

31
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:06,631
Threaten me again, and
this will be your family.

32
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,607
From the
moment Alma Fillcot

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,480
decided to join the
Elysian Park Garden Club,

34
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,656
she began to change.

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,268
But her husband was
completely oblivious

36
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:37,009
to her stylish transformation.

37
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:40,926
He had no idea she'd
begun to polish her nails.

38
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,148
He had not noticed how elegantly
she was wearing her hair.

39
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:49,805
And he paid no attention to
her new shade of lipstick.

40
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:52,199
It was unfortunate.

41
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:55,811
If Bertram had noticed
these changes in Alma

42
00:01:55,854 --> 00:02:00,120
he might have been prepared
for what happened next.

43
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,122
Shall I take you
straight to the clinic?

44
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,254
Yes, yes. I have an
early appointment.

45
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,603
Hmm. Very well.

46
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:10,260
Since we have a moment,

47
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,654
there is something that
I would like to discuss.

48
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,177
Well, what's that?

49
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,223
- Your little hobby.
- Ah.

50
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,833
- Hmm.
- That's funny.

51
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,376
'Cause I've been doing some
thinking about that myself.

52
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,793
You know, I regret
some of the words

53
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,274
that I've hurled at you
in the last few weeks.

54
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,799
Sick, psychopathic, demented.

55
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:30,106
You were only trying to
alleviate the suffering

56
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,369
of some people who
were already dying.

57
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:35,981
I see now that you're a hero.

58
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,681
I'm
con... I'm confused.

59
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,944
I couldn't comprehend it before

60
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:44,294
because I didn't know
any of those people.

61
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,035
But now I understand,

62
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,298
because I'm aware of someone

63
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:51,345
who is desperately in
need of the kind of help

64
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,042
that only you can supply.

65
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,131
Wh... What are you saying?

66
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,095
There's someone
that you want me to...

67
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:59,179
Oh, yes.

68
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:02,225
And you'd be doing
God's work, my love.

69
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,184
My hero.

70
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,098
Who exactly are
we talking about?

71
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:08,449
You know Rita Castillo?

72
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:10,886
She came to our house
with the Garden Club?

73
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,583
Yes. Yes, I treat her cat.

74
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,889
- Mm-hmm.
- Is she ill?

75
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:14,977
Oh, no.

76
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,936
No, but, um

77
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,025
she has a husband.

78
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,419
His name is Carlo and

79
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:25,074
he's in so much pain.

80
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:29,383
Yes, Alma
Fillcot had truly changed.

81
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:32,647
But by the time her
husband could see it

82
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,779
it was too late.

83
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:58,847
At the exact same moment

84
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,981
Alma Fillcot was asking her
husband to kill Carlo Castillo,

85
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:07,508
his wife was doing some
diabolical plotting of her own.

86
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,780
Phone for you, Mrs. Castillo.

87
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,960
- Hello?
- Hey, gorgeous.

88
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,875
- It's me.
- It's about time you called.

89
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,964
How'd your date go
with you know who?

90
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:32,315
- Swell, if I do say so myself.
- Good.

91
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,926
Because I need you to
screw her... tonight.

92
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,101
Tonight?

93
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,929
Carlo is starting
to communicate.

94
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,844
He even tried to warn
Catherine about you.

95
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,934
I need that compromising
photo as soon as possible.

96
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,632
She's a church-going spinster.

97
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,677
She's not going put
out on the second date.

98
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,679
Well, then get her drunk.
Tell her you love her.

99
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,507
I don't care how
you do it, just...

100
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:54,903
Just, just make it happen.

101
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,948
Goodbye.

102
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,864
You ended that
call awfully fast.

103
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,388
Who was it?

104
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:02,780
Your secret lover?

105
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,826
For a woman who
dresses like a nun,

106
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:06,697
you certainly have
a filthy mind.

107
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,179
Hello?

108
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,269
Oh.

109
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,966
It's for you.

110
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:23,366
- Hello?
- Hey, Catherine. It's me.

111
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,847
You got any plans tonight?

112
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,544
I thought maybe we
could grab some dinner.

113
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:31,243
It would be lovely to see
you, but I'm busy tonight.

114
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,203
What about tomorrow night?

115
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,204
You can't say no to that.

116
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,728
It's, uh... my birthday?

117
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,208
Well...

118
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,690
I-I don't want you to be
alone on your birthday.

119
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:45,301
So, shall we say 6:00?

120
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,694
It's a date.

121
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,182
Are you serious?

122
00:05:57,226 --> 00:06:00,098
You really want me to
kill Carlo Castillo?

123
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,013
I-I want you to help him.

124
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,754
Isn't that the term you prefer?

125
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,930
Yes, and every time I've
used it, you've corrected me.

126
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:06,975
So, what's changed?

127
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,324
Well, I saw him for myself.

128
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,457
He can't move or

129
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,373
feed himself or bathe.

130
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,852
When did you see him?

131
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,376
Last night, at Rita's.

132
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,900
Sounds like you two
have grown close.

133
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:20,510
Oh, yes.

134
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:23,208
She's become a good chum.

135
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:24,949
Did she get you into
the Garden Club?

136
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:26,429
Rita tried.

137
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,083
The other ladies
voted for Ada Coy.

138
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,345
Ah, Alma.

139
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,826
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

140
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:33,567
I only wanted to get in

141
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,873
so that I could make some
new friends, and now I have.

142
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:39,181
Rita's really gone out of
her way to be kind to me,

143
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,270
even while dealing with
a crippled husband.

144
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:43,707
Did she come to you about this?

145
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,448
Why would she?

146
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,973
It's not as if I go around
advertising your services.

147
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:54,631
So... you'll help him?

148
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:55,806
Alma.

149
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,852
While I was away on my trip,

150
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:00,463
I had a bit of an epiphany.

151
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,595
An epiphany?

152
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,161
I realized I'd only been ending

153
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,120
the suffering of others
to ease my own pain.

154
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:08,166
My actions were more
selfish than merciful.

155
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,212
So I vowed to never do it again.

156
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,954
And you won't.

157
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,391
After you help Carlo,

158
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,655
you'll put away your
trusty syringes forever.

159
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,136
I'm sorry, Alma.
The answer is no.

160
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,703
I should go.

161
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,271
Bertram!

162
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:29,492
We're not done discussing this.

163
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,538
Alma, my mind is made up.

164
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,975
There's nothing you
can do to change it.

165
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,681
Hey, Dee.

166
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:45,813
Hey. Thanks for meeting me.

167
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:46,814
Come here.

168
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,380
I-Is something wrong?

169
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:49,817
Is everything all right?

170
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,296
You sounded so
strange on the phone.

171
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,646
Yeah.

172
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,039
I've gotten myself
into a situation.

173
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,582
Okay, well, we-we can
go somewhere and we can

174
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,086
- talk about it, right?
- Oh, I can't.

175
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,958
And I'm really sorry
to spring this on you.

176
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,221
I, I like you so much.

177
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,442
More than you know, but

178
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,097
we can't see each other anymore.

179
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,533
Why not?

180
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,274
I can't say.

181
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,623
Did I do something?

182
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,190
Oh, God, no.

183
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:18,193
This has nothing to do
with you. I promise.

184
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,717
Well, whatever it is,
we-we can talk about it.

185
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,502
Like we always do.

186
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,983
You're such a good guy, Vern.

187
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:28,943
And I think you deserve all
the happiness in the world.

188
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,251
Wait, Dee.

189
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:35,253
Dee!

190
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,355
Oh, hello there.

191
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,487
Hey, Grace.

192
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,619
What a surprise.

193
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:53,924
What is going on?

194
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,665
Oh, I

195
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,972
just thought my garden could
use a little spiffing up.

196
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:00,757
Oh, yeah, well, I understand.

197
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:04,021
New projects help us take
our minds off our troubles.

198
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:07,547
Oh. Well, that's not the only
new project I'm working on.

199
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,287
Hmm?

200
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,159
Believe you me. Tea?

201
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,994
I still don't know why
Rita treated you so badly.

202
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:21,604
I asked all the
ladies in the club

203
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,301
if they knew something I didn't.

204
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,346
Any theories?

205
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:25,869
No.

206
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,393
But she's always been
a very unhappy person.

207
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,047
- Mm.
- Not surprised,

208
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,528
- given who she's married to.
- What does that mean?

209
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,444
Apparently,

210
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,360
Carlo was something of an ogre.

211
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:41,015
Before he had the stroke,

212
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:43,887
he used to beat Rita.

213
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:54,245
- That is just awful.
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:01,078
Please... go on.

215
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,655
Look at that.

216
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,526
It's been ages since
you baked a cherry pie.

217
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,919
Yes, well,

218
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,442
I wanted to do something special

219
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,706
to apologize for this morning.

220
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:22,447
Oh, when you asked
me to help Carlo?

221
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:24,058
Yes.

222
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:27,017
You see, I-I wasn't
completely honest with you.

223
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,019
I held back some
important details.

224
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,543
That was wrong of me. I'm sorry.

225
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,371
What details are
you referring to?

226
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:34,764
Well

227
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,767
the truth is, I don't
care about Carlo at all.

228
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:40,770
In fact, I think he deserves
every bit of pain that he's in.

229
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,685
Well, if that's
the way you feel,

230
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,315
why would you want me
to hasten his death?

231
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,863
Because I care about Rita.

232
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,560
Oh, Bertie.

233
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,911
Carlo is an awful man.

234
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,304
He used to beat her. Savagely.

235
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:56,307
Rita wept when she
spoke of his cruelty.

236
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:58,092
That's horrible.

237
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,877
Thank God he can't
hurt her anymore.

238
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,227
Yes, but now she has
to take care of him.

239
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,794
And can you imagine?

240
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:07,710
Being forced to
nurse your tormentor?

241
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,278
She's so unhappy.

242
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,673
Drinking and neglecting
her own health.

243
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,633
I fear that she might
die before Carlo does.

244
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,722
That poor woman.

245
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:24,031
But you could help her.

246
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,686
Oh, Bertram.

247
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,427
You want to. I know you do.

248
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,647
You can't ignore that
kind of suffering.

249
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,605
All I'm asking for

250
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,522
is one final act of mercy.

251
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,830
Please.

252
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,746
Save my friend.

253
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,838
All right.

254
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:50,100
I'll do it.

255
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,972
Oh...

256
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,409
Bless you, Bertie.

257
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,021
You know what would
be nice on this pie?

258
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,936
- Some ice cream.
- Mm.

259
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,112
- Sounds delicious.
- Doesn't it?

260
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:04,941
Mmm.

261
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,864
Are you glad to be back?

262
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,518
You know I am.

263
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:17,867
Ah, hey, look.

264
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,043
It's our old pal Mr. Murphy.

265
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,741
Oh.

266
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:24,831
I forgot there was a
fire escape here.

267
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:27,921
This is the perfect place
for my photographer to hide.

268
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,531
I hope he's patient.

269
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:30,943
It's going to take a lot
of booze during dinner

270
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,664
to get Catherine back
here for dessert.

271
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,710
You may want to knock
a few back yourself.

272
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,234
You'll have to be drunk
to jump those old bones.

273
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,324
She's not so bad.

274
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,500
Excuse me?

275
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,478
Oh, I thought she was an
old pickle-puss at first,

276
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:45,982
but once she lets
her guard down,

277
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,636
she's actually got
a really nice smile.

278
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,725
And she's only... what?

279
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,074
Five years older than you?

280
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,339
You know

281
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:58,342
this seduction doesn't have
to end in consummation.

282
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,711
Aw, I thought that
was the whole point.

283
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,606
No. The photo is the point.

284
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,434
Once Catherine is
naked and on her back,

285
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:04,914
you'll have hit the high note.

286
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,395
No need to sing
the entire opera.

287
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:09,266
You're jealous.

288
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,746
Of her?

289
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,574
Don't be preposterous.

290
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,884
You know, I have missed
this old murphy bed.

291
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:21,061
What do you say
we rechristen it?

292
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:24,455
Why? So I have nothing left
in the tank for Catherine?

293
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:27,458
How devious do you think I am?

294
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,422
You've been to the gym
this morning, haven't you?

295
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,902
Oh, what gave it
away, the muscles?

296
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,817
No, the smell.

297
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,253
You need a shower.

298
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,645
Oh.

299
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,822
Well, give me five.

300
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,607
And-and keep the motor running.

301
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,877
You the manager here?

302
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,793
I'm looking for a
guy who lived in 3B.

303
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,577
I thought maybe he left
a forwarding address

304
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,709
where he can be reached.

305
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,015
You talking about Scooter?

306
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,668
He moved back in this morning.

307
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,148
He did?

308
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,455
Oh. Ah.

309
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,370
Well, thanks.

310
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,379
Oh, it's you.

311
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,250
Is Scooter here?

312
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:21,948
I thought you were
done with him.

313
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,994
Something's happened.

314
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:27,301
And it's very important
I speak to him.

315
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,305
Please.

316
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:36,310
Oh, my God. You're pregnant.

317
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,920
You can tell?

318
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,227
Oh, it's all over your face.

319
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,838
That and some
fairly cheap makeup.

320
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,535
Nice.

321
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:49,018
Oh, before I forget, I have a
message for you from my mom.

322
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:53,849
You get all that?

323
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,895
Or do I need to repeat it?

324
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,419
You know what?

325
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,900
I'll come back later
when Scoot can talk.

326
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,599
Are you, uh, sure
you want to tell him?

327
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,862
How can I not?

328
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,124
It's his baby.

329
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:10,605
Well, what are you hoping for?

330
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:13,521
That he'll tell
you he loves you?

331
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,349
Because he doesn't.

332
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:18,047
And what if he decides to do
the right thing and marry you?

333
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:21,094
You'd have two infants to
take care of instead of one.

334
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:24,662
Scooter is not ready
to be a father.

335
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,142
Or a husband.

336
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:29,015
Hell, he can barely
cut it as a boyfriend.

337
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,887
I do not want to marry Scooter.

338
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,498
But I don't got a
lot of choices here.

339
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,458
You'll think of something.

340
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,590
You're too smart to
let one stupid mistake

341
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,679
ruin the rest of your life.

342
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,819
Congrats.

343
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:53,648
He's all yours.

344
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:55,911
Thank you.

345
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,000
You know, if you
need some money...

346
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,929
Who was that at the door?

347
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,541
Just a door-to-door salesman.

348
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:18,978
What were they selling?

349
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,849
Nothing we need.

350
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,686
Mmm.

351
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,166
- Delicious.
- Hmm.

352
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,447
You made my cocoa just
the way I like it.

353
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:35,516
Thank you, my darling.

354
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,344
You're very welcome, Bertie.

355
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:40,129
Say, how are you
at housebreaking?

356
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:41,565
What's that?

357
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,306
You know, picking
locks and all that?

358
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,750
I think it's best
if you visit Carlo

359
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,440
late at night when
everyone's asleep.

360
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,833
But have you ever broken
into a locked house before?

361
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,724
Well, I mean, usually,
when I drop in on someone

362
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:52,030
to help them, they
just open the door.

363
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,664
Unless they're
too ill to get up,

364
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,231
and then I find a way in.

365
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,060
You're so clever.

366
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,062
Now, it is a very,
very big house.

367
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,064
And so, I have made you a map.

368
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:05,415
Oh. Many is the time I could
have used one of these.

369
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,591
Yes. So, Carlo's room is here.

370
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,071
Up the stairs, take a right.

371
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,440
Last one on the
left, not the right.

372
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,900
- That's Rita's bedroom.
- Right.

373
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:14,076
Now, the front door
is very, very solid,

374
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,512
but if you come around the back,

375
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:16,707
there are French doors
that lead into the foyer.

376
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,428
- Is that easier?
- Oh, much.

377
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,040
Hmm. Now, will you have
to break the glass?

378
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,043
No. No. I can't leave any
signs of forced entry.

379
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,870
I'd just be asking
for an autopsy.

380
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,917
And if the police
did do an autopsy,

381
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,267
would they find the
drug that you use?

382
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,834
They'd have to be
looking for it.

383
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,638
And they wouldn't be unless
they suspected foul play.

384
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:36,272
- Hmm.
- And it's never happened.

385
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:37,510
My
record is spotless.

386
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,973
26 deaths, each ruled
to be by natural causes.

387
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:43,777
- That's quite an accomplishment.
- Oh, thank you, darling.

388
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,066
You know, it seems odd
getting compliments

389
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,980
for something I hid
from you for many years.

390
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,244
I think it's good that
I know these things.

391
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,116
Makes our marriage stronger.

392
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,422
Yes, it does.

393
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,772
- Yes.

394
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:00,862
Mmm. Mmm.

395
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:02,907
You want me to
photograph your lover

396
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,780
screwing your stepdaughter?

397
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:09,262
If you try hard enough, you
can make anything sound sordid.

398
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,264
Boy, you are a piece of work.

399
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,962
This is completely justified.

400
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:16,704
That crone has had it
in for me since day one.

401
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,227
I have to fight back.

402
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,142
By using your own
gigolo as bait?

403
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,057
It's not like he hasn't
cheated on me before.

404
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,278
At least he won't get
this one pregnant.

405
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,106
Pregnant?

406
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:31,153
Remember that large
girl he was seeing?

407
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:35,070
She showed up at his place
today to give him the bad news.

408
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,248
The... the waitress?

409
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,858
She's having a baby?

410
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,686
I convinced her not
to tell Scooter.

411
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,820
She's not so dumb that she can't
see he'd make a lousy father.

412
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:51,367
So, if you're not going
to take the photo,

413
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,957
can you refer someone who will?

414
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,482
Did I say I wouldn't do it?

415
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:56,633
You haven't even
made me an offer yet.

416
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,180
Oh.

417
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,617
So, your disgust can be
overcome for the right price?

418
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,708
Some days money doesn't
mean a lot to me.

419
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:07,668
Lucky for you, this
isn't one of them.

420
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,764
That's it. Open up
and chew slowly.

421
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,420
Catherine.

422
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:22,267
Your friend from the dry
cleaner is downstairs.

423
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,510
Thanks.

424
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:28,732
Do you want one more fry
before I leave, Papa?

425
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,561
What's wrong?

426
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,737
Are you full?

427
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,566
Why are you mad?

428
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,394
Because I'm going
out for dinner?

429
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,309
That's silly.

430
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,224
I need to start
enjoying my life.

431
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:45,358
You know, I'm not 23 anymore.

432
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,229
I'll vouch for that.

433
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,624
I won't be too late.

434
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,235
I'll tuck you in when
I come home. Hmm?

435
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,589
She's going to have sex tonight.

436
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,766
With a man you don't approve of.

437
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,596
If you hadn't threatened
to disinherit her,

438
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,730
I wouldn't have anything
to blackmail her with.

439
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:14,213
But now I can scare her
all the way back to Texas.

440
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:19,218
And then it's just you and me.

441
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,222
Doesn't that sound like fun?

442
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,729
I hear this is
their best chianti.

443
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,558
But why
buy the whole bottle?

444
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,517
We won't be able
to drink it all.

445
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,996
Oh, we got to try.

446
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,128
It's my birthday.

447
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,130
That's right.

448
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,827
I almost forgot.

449
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:09,877
- Oh, you got me a gift?
- Just a small token, really.

450
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,883
Those are real diamonds.

451
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,974
Catherine.

452
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,280
This is too expensive.

453
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,281
No.

454
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,457
Didn't cost me a cent.

455
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,198
I bought them years
ago for another man.

456
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,765
Do you like them?

457
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,245
I love them.

458
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,725
I'm so glad.

459
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:36,904
This is shaping up to be
my best birthday ever.

460
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,211
Oh.

461
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:17,858
So I don't get expensive
gifts for Papa anymore

462
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,339
because I know they're going
to end up going to Rita.

463
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,731
Now, that's your stepmother?

464
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,559
I guess you never
liked her, huh?

465
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:25,648
Well, actually, we
used to be friends,

466
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:27,650
right when she and
Papa got engaged.

467
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:29,391
She was nice back then.

468
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,219
But right after the wedding,

469
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,961
that's when Rita
showed her true colors.

470
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,224
- She wasn't so nice anymore?
- Mm.

471
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:39,227
No. You see...

472
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,752
Rita can be sweet as pie
as long as she needs you,

473
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,712
but once she no
longer needs you...

474
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,932
You're out on your ass.

475
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,108
I should powder my nose.

476
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,154
Excuse me.

477
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,772
You want to hurry it up, Romeo?

478
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,252
It's almost midnight.

479
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:06,099
You must be the guy Rita
hired to take the photo.

480
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:09,518
And I hope I'm doing my job half
as well as you're doing yours.

481
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:10,563
Excuse me?

482
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,042
I've been watching you work.

483
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:14,175
If I didn't already
know the plan,

484
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,873
I'd swear you had a
yen for that broad.

485
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:25,708
He left it for
Catherine to find.

486
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,580
Yeah.

487
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:30,147
She told him she'd check on
him when she gets home tonight.

488
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:32,759
I'm just glad you
found it first.

489
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,804
What are we going to do?

490
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:38,068
Well, we need to keep
him away from all lawyers

491
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,940
and condiments.

492
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,463
This is no joke.

493
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,204
I'm worried.

494
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:45,467
Once we have the photo,
Catherine will go back home.

495
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:46,903
Trust me.

496
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,315
She does not want
to be disinherited.

497
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:49,863
So, what if we get rid of her?

498
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,822
Carlo heard you with
Scooter the night he fell.

499
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,694
If he tells someone
he wants a divorce...

500
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:56,173
And how's he going to do that?

501
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:57,523
He can't talk.

502
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:58,698
For now.

503
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:00,482
What if he gets his voice back?

504
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:01,720
Wh-What, what if
he gets to a phone

505
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:03,485
when one of us isn't looking?

506
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:05,969
We might not know until a lawyer
shows up with divorce papers.

507
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:07,489
Then what?

508
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:08,838
Well, then I'm screwed.

509
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,318
Not just you.

510
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:12,363
If you lose your home,
I lose mine, too.

511
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,322
Let's not panic.

512
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:17,020
Once Catherine is gone,
it'll just be the three of us

513
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:19,501
in this house, and we can
watch him like a hawk.

514
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,503
Sedate him

515
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,505
if we have to.

516
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,550
Or

517
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,814
We can kill him.

518
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:29,337
Isabel.

519
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,339
We've gotten away
with it before.

520
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:45,919
Are you ready?

521
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:47,616
Why are you dressed like that?

522
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,096
Isn't it obvious?

523
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:51,272
I'm going with you.

524
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:53,274
No, no. That wasn't
part of the plan.

525
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,928
It's far too risky.

526
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,452
What's risky is sending
you into Rita's house

527
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,975
without a lookout.

528
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:00,629
I won't go inside.

529
00:25:00,673 --> 00:25:02,979
I'll stay in the car and
keep watch, just in case.

530
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:05,068
Well, I suppose
that'll be all right.

531
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:07,549
Now, don't forget your coat.

532
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:08,942
It's chilly out.

533
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:10,552
We can't have you
catching your death.

534
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,250
What?

535
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:15,054
It's just nice to know that
you still worry about me.

536
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,037
Makes me feel like
we're back to normal.

537
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,257
Of course we're back
to normal.

538
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,738
I think I saw your coat
on a chair in the kitchen.

539
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:24,523
- Go get it.
- Yes.

540
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,819
- Dee.

541
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:02,212
I've been meaning to call you.

542
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:03,779
How are you doing?
Everything okay?

543
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:06,260
Not really. You got a minute?

544
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:07,478
Look around.

545
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:08,915
I got all the time in the world.

546
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,220
What's up?

547
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,788
You remember last summer?

548
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,616
You told me about
your predicament.

549
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:16,661
Well...

550
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:20,100
It seems I'm now
in the same boat.

551
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:21,710
No.

552
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,236
Have you told your parents?

553
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,542
No.

554
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:30,719
I'm thinking maybe they
won't need to know.

555
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:32,460
If I do what you did.

556
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,418
Remember, I had no choice.

557
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,725
My folks would have disowned me.

558
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,249
And the guy I was seeing
was married, so...

559
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:41,991
Tell me about the
place you went.

560
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,819
St. Anne's?

561
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,691
It was nice.

562
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,780
They took good care of me.

563
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,565
What was it like?

564
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,393
When you gave birth?

565
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,482
The doctors gave me
something for the pain,

566
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,266
so it's a bit hazy.

567
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,965
I remember one of the nuns
said not to look at the baby

568
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,488
when it came out.

569
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:01,881
That it would be too painful.

570
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:04,710
But I looked anyway.

571
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,060
It was a boy.

572
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,584
He looked just like me. I think.

573
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:13,022
They took him away so quick.

574
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,807
Do you know what
happened to him?

575
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:18,637
My little guy was adopted
by a family in Utah.

576
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,901
They got money, a big
house with a yard.

577
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,990
It makes me feel good
knowing he traded up.

578
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:28,690
Ever think about him?

579
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:31,084
What do you think?

580
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,830
But the good news is,

581
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,049
I graduate secretarial
school in May,

582
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:42,312
and my folks will be
there to cheer me on.

583
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,402
No. I made the right decision.

584
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,017
It's getting late.

585
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,106
I should go.

586
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:57,327
If you do decide to
go to St. Anne's,

587
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:59,721
can I give you some advice?

588
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:00,983
Sure.

589
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:02,724
Listen to the nuns.

590
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,988
Don't look at it.

591
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,868
I'm telling you, it's the
only way to protect yourself.

592
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:18,740
You don't think I've thought
about killing Carlo before?

593
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:22,701
I came this close to drowning
him in the tub last month.

594
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,050
Then why didn't you?

595
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,878
It's not worth the risk.

596
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,706
I say it is.

597
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,534
We shot Harry. Look
how that paid off.

598
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:33,407
Elysian Park is not Galveston.

599
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,367
And Carlo's not some violent
brute no one will miss.

600
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:40,936
I'm not saying we shoot him.

601
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,286
There are poisons we could buy.

602
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,027
Something undetectable.

603
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,942
Yeah, and if the
police get suspicious?

604
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,118
Then we run, like before.

605
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:51,251
- We change our names.
- No.

606
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:53,601
I don't want to change
my identity again.

607
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:56,517
I've spent the last ten
years perfecting this one.

608
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:01,391
Ooh, God. My head is spinning.

609
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:03,611
Oh. You're drunk.

610
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,530
We're not going to
solve this tonight.

611
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:13,752
We can talk
about it tomorrow.

612
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,887
Just promise me,

613
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,150
no matter what happens,

614
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,239
you won't leave me.

615
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,372
I promise. I won't.

616
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,158
Good.

617
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:32,248
I love you, Isabel.

618
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:34,598
I love you too, cousin.

619
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:43,085
There's still
a light on upstairs.

620
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:44,695
That's Rita's dressing room.

621
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,741
Let's hope she's
not a night owl.

622
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,049
Are you hungry?

623
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:52,834
I brought us some
snacks and cocoa.

624
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:56,533
The taking of a human life
is a grave and sacred task.

625
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:58,579
It's not a night
at the drive-in.

626
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:00,842
This isn't frivolous.

627
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:04,324
You know how you get when
your blood sugar drops.

628
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,065
Yes. I'm sorry.

629
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:08,589
I'm a bit nervous about Carlo.

630
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:10,939
I'm just not sure what
his reaction will be.

631
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,854
He'll probably be a bit scared.

632
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,943
He might be a little
bit startled at first.

633
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:17,859
But, you know, you
have such a warm smile.

634
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm sure you'll put
him right at ease.

635
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:21,341
Thank you, Alma.

636
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:23,343
I'm glad you're here
to tell me that.

637
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:24,823
Me, too.

638
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,695
Chocolate chip cookie?

639
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,020
Oh, go on then,
just one.

640
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:31,133
Yes.

641
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,443
I had a lovely evening, Scooter.

642
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,314
Oh, does it have to be over?

643
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,229
We could swing by my
place for a nightcap.

644
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:42,188
Oh, I had too much
to drink already.

645
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,233
I'm not sure I can trust myself.

646
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,321
Don't you trust me?

647
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:46,845
Even less.

648
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,213
It's been wonderful,
but I do think

649
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:50,457
you need to take me home now.

650
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,198
Ah...

651
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:54,635
Ah, hang on a sec.
I... I-I think

652
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:57,029
- I left something at the table.
- Okay.

653
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:04,775
Change of plans.

654
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,014
She wants me to take her home.

655
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:07,430
Are you calling it off?

656
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:08,867
What am I supposed to do?

657
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,216
Drag her back to my place?

658
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,913
Rita expects a photo
in the morning.

659
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,220
How do you think she'll
react if we don't deliver?

660
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,265
Oh, geez.

661
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:17,876
Okay.

662
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,616
Follow me back to Rita's place.

663
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,401
I'll try to get
something started there.

664
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:43,466
It's off. Rita's light is off.

665
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,294
Here we go. Wish me luck.

666
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:47,122
Here. When you get
into Carlo's room,

667
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,428
just give me a signal

668
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:51,083
- through the window.
- Why?

669
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,999
So I know that you made
it upstairs safely.

670
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:56,175
Just shine your
flashlight out the window.

671
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,133
- Oh.
- All right? Yeah, okay.

672
00:31:58,177 --> 00:32:00,657
Bye. Good luck.

673
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:03,095
And if anything happens
downstairs, let me know.

674
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,226
How will I do that?

675
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,575
Honk the horn.

676
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:08,013
We're having quite an
adventure, aren't we?

677
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,492
Yes. We're like
Bonnie and Clyde.

678
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:13,453
- But with cookies.
- Yes.

679
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,965
You're awake.

680
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,011
I'm sorry to startle you.

681
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,578
I'm not sure if
you'll remember me.

682
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:37,537
I'm Dr. Fillcot.

683
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,755
Your vet.

684
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,409
What?

685
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,690
I know you're

686
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,692
in a great deal of pain.

687
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:07,132
And I'm here to relieve
you of your suffering.

688
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,572
Perhaps we'll start
with a sedative.

689
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:03,840
Boy. How about that wind?

690
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,451
I think a storm is coming.

691
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:06,669
My hair is frightful.

692
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:07,801
Make yourself at home.

693
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,585
I'll only be a moment.

694
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:18,203
Did you hear something?

695
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,788
You said, "Make
yourself at home."

696
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,269
Scooter, really.

697
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:43,141
I'm old enough to
be your mother.

698
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:46,274
You're never too
old to have fun.

699
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,191
Why do you want to
have fun with me?

700
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,975
Let's face it.

701
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:54,108
I'm not a great beauty.

702
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,066
I'm lonely, okay?

703
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,504
You seem like
you're lonely, too.

704
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:02,247
Yes.

705
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,987
I am lonely.

706
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:07,121
And rich.

707
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,993
If having money means
you can't trust anyone,

708
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:12,518
that you can't accept
love when offered

709
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,520
then what good is it?

710
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,788
There's no need
to be frightened.

711
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:23,877
It'll all be over so soon.

712
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:28,838
I want your last
moments to be serene.

713
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:31,232
- And beautiful.

714
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:37,934
Oh. Did the lightning
startle you?

715
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:40,023
I'm so sorry.

716
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,076
So, you
really like me?

717
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,121
Of course I do.

718
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,211
You're the nicest person
I've met in this town.

719
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,214
I'm not that nice.

720
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,520
Come on.

721
00:36:58,564 --> 00:36:59,869
You're a doll.

722
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:01,567
You treat me like I'm somebody,

723
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,743
and the sweet way you
take care of your dad.

724
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:05,527
Oh, I hate my papa.

725
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:07,660
Even more since I met you.

726
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:11,185
You make me remember
everything he took from me.

727
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,361
When I still had
something to offer.

728
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:27,549
I know what it feels like to
think you've missed the boat.

729
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,901
That it's too late

730
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:33,468
to get what you want.

731
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:36,210
Maybe it is.

732
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:39,866
Or maybe it isn't.

733
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:15,336
Bertram.

734
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,033
Alma, what are you doing?

735
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,881
There are two people downstairs.
I don't know who they are.

736
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,515
Why didn't you honk the horn?

737
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,692
I did. You must just
not have heard it.

738
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,433
Oh. Is it done?

739
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:27,174
Yes, his suffering has ended.

740
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:29,045
Which is more than
can be said for mine.

741
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:30,656
That old man grabbed me.

742
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:32,048
Will you stop complaining.

743
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,374
We need to get out
of here. Come on.

744
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:44,104
There were two people talking
in the living room earlier.

745
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:45,584
A man and a woman.

746
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,153
Well, they're not talking now.

747
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,513
Are they there?

748
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:02,992
Shh.

749
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,442
Maybe the wind
will distract them.

750
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:19,922
They don't need any more
distracting. Come on.

751
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:54,250
Rise and shine, Papa.

752
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:56,296
The clouds are gone.

753
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,994
It's a glorious day, Papa.

754
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,824
Papa?

755
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:07,350
Papa!

756
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:27,370
We have to talk.

757
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,373
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to talk.

758
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,375
I'm ashamed of
how I left things.

759
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:33,594
Now, just forget about it.

760
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:35,509
No, I have to explain.

761
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,032
The truth is, I...

762
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:38,860
I'm in so much trouble.

763
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:40,862
And lately it's felt like

764
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:42,647
you're my best
friend in the world.

765
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,387
So, I'm back.

766
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:46,868
Because I trust you to
give me good advice.

767
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,044
See, the...

768
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,829
The thing I couldn't
tell you was...

769
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,352
You're pregnant.

770
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:55,442
How?

771
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:57,183
I am a detective.

772
00:42:57,226 --> 00:42:59,315
Oh, Vern.

773
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:02,362
What am I gonna do?

774
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:04,625
Here's a thought.

775
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:06,453
Marry me.

776
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:08,237
What?

777
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:12,502
Look, if you're just trying
to be a good guy here...

778
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,722
No. That's not what this is.

779
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:18,639
But you'd be raising
another man's baby.

780
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:21,294
With the woman I love.

781
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:25,211
Oh, Vern.

782
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:26,778
Are you absolutely sure?

783
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:28,518
Oh, yeah.

784
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:30,390
I've given it a lot of thought.

785
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:31,783
In fact...

786
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:35,047
I bought this for
you last night.

787
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,093
I hope it's okay.

788
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:48,451
Sorry for being so blunt.

789
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,255
I probably should have had
a fancy speech prepared.

790
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:51,541
But...

791
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:54,457
But if you'll have me...

792
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:05,381
I guess that's a yes, huh?

793
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:07,819
Oh. That's more than a yes.

794
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:09,821
That's a "you betcha."

795
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:08,706
Hello.

796
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:09,968
Yes, hello.

797
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:12,622
My name is Mary Booth.

798
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,363
I live in your neighborhood.

799
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:17,105
I drove by your home
and saw the ambulance.

800
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:18,672
I was concerned.

801
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,283
Did something happen
to Mr. Castillo?

802
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:22,894
Yes.

803
00:45:22,937 --> 00:45:24,547
My father died last night.

804
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,071
Oh, no.

805
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:27,855
Well, um...

806
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:30,466
This is just awful of me to ask,

807
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,642
but do you know how he died?

808
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:34,209
What do you mean?

809
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:36,995
Well, I was in a café last week,

810
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:39,084
and I overheard his wife Rita

811
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:41,477
saying the most awful
things about him

812
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:43,523
and the money that she
expected to inherit.

813
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:47,005
Uh, "Any day now" was
the phrase that she used.

814
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,007
When you said that he'd died,

815
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,010
the hairs on the back of
my neck just stood up.

816
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:54,447
I...

817
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,492
Maybe it's wrong of me,
but I felt that I had

818
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:57,755
to say something.

819
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,669
No.

820
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:01,846
It's a good thing you called.
