1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,270
******g is not technically yogurt,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,910
because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,420
It's really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,530
Oh,that's very interesting.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,530
It's also not pink and has no berries.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,010
Yeah,but it doesn't really answer my question.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,550
What was your question again?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,730
Do you want some?

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,700
Right. No.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,060
- I'm lactose intolerant. - Right.

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,550
- So,gas. - Yeah,got it.

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,390
Well... good night.

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,540
What are you doing?

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,210
Oh,there's a draft.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,620
I didn't feel a draft.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,770
Why don't we just go into,uh,your...

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,670
Yeah,you know what,maybe we should slow things down a little.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,520
No,no,I didn't mean to go into your apartment to go fast.

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,540
No,I know.

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,440
I know what you meant,it's just... this is only our first date.

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,840
Yeah,okay,sure,no problem.

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,710
Why don't we just figure out where we're going and when we want to get there,

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,490
and then rate of speed equals distance over time.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Solve for R.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,080
Or we could just wing it.

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,720
That might work,too.

27
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,820
- Good night,Leonard. - Good night.

28
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,090
He's coming-- screensaver!

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,220
Oh,hey,Leonard. How was your date?

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,290
Bite me.

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,870
Sheldon,how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
They were clever,Leonard.

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,450
They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,070
You should thank us.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,800
When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned,

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,100
this right here is the black box.

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,750
What are you talking about? The date went fine.

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Dude,she said she wants to slow things down.

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,880
Okay,so she said she wants to slow things down.

40
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,850
It's like saying,"I'm really enjoying this meal.

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,230
I'm going to slow down and savor it."

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,600
No,it's like,"This fish tastes bad,

43
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,850
so I'm gonna slow down and spit it out."

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,010
- You being the fish. - I'm not the fish.

45
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,250
Oh,really? Did you make a second date?

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,150
Well,no,we sort of decided to wing it.

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,270
Oh,even I know that's lame.

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,490
Okay,all right,let's assume your hypothesis.

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,960
We went to dinner,we talked,we laughed,we kissed.

50
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,820
Where could I have possibly gone wrong?

51
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,010
Think back,Leonard.

52
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,140
The littlest things can set women off.

53
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,020
Like,"Hey,the waitress is hot,I bet we could get her to come home with us."

54
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,840
Or,"How much does your mom weigh?

55
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,230
I want to know what I'm getting into."

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,650
I didn't say anything like that.

57
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,540
Good,'cause they don't work.

58
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,260
They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

59
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,330
Sadly,that's my home run swing.

60
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,640
Look,everything went fine.

61
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,940
I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters.

62
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,790
That woman across the hall is into me.

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,610
Let's go to the tape.

64
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,710
Look at her reaction to the good night kiss.

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,230
No change in respiration,pupils un-dilated,no flushing of the chest.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,150
Nice close-up,by the way.

67
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,810
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched: no tongue access.

68
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,610
Clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.

69
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,250
That's not a bad sign.

70
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,540
Please,you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

71
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,780
And the worst sign of all is you're here and not there.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,940
I'm not there because I'm taking things slow,which,

73
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,050
by the way,compared to you guys,approaches warp speed.

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,490
And take down that camera.

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,820
He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,200
Give him time.

77
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:14,860

<font color="#ffff00">The Big Bang Theory Season02 Episode01</font>

80
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,980
Oh,hi,Penny.

81
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,050
FYI,the hot water is inadequate on machine two,so colors only,

82
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,960
and four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle,

83
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,730
so I'd avoid using that for your delicates.

84
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,720
Thanks.

85
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,700
Oh,good Lord...

86
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,320
why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?

87
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,240
Sheldon,can I ask you a question?

88
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,710
I would prefer that you not,but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,770
All right,I heard yes,so...

90
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,570
Okay,here's my question.

91
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,690
Has Leonard ever dated, you know,a regular girl?

92
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,070
Well,I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity.

93
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,310
Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,260
No,I meant,has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

95
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,670
Well,a few years ago,he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French literature.

96
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,680
How is that not a brainiac?

97
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,750
Well,for one thing,she was French.

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,200
For another,it was literature.

99
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,720
So...

100
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,500
do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating,he'll eventually get bored with me?

101
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,000
- That depends. - On what?

102
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,660
- Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? - No.

103
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,530
- Do you speak Klingon? - No.

104
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,700
- You know any card tricks? - Okay,you know what...

105
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,850
I get it.

106
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,340
Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress-slash-actress

107
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,990
who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,570
Why would you lie about that?

109
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,700
Well,he was going on and on about this college and that grad school,and I...

110
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,240
I didn't want him to think I was some kind of stupid loser.

111
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,030
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser" was "community college graduate"?

112
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,980
You know,there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.

113
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,510
Yeah,but you are neither.

114
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,530
Right. Okay,look,this is between you and me.

115
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,060
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

116
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,790
- You're asking me to keep a secret? - Yeah.

117
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,430
Well,I'm sorry,but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret,

118
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,760
so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping.

119
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,800
You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.

120
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,750
What?

121
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,170
Secret keeping is a complicated endeavor.

122
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,630
One has to be concerned not only about what one says,

123
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,810
but about facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.

124
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,120
When I try to deceive,I myself have more nervous tics than a Lyme disease research facility.

125
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,740
It's a joke.

126
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,980
It relies on the homonymic relationship between "tick,"

127
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,940
the bloodsucking arachnid,and "tic," the involuntary muscular contraction.

128
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,230
I made it up myself.

129
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,790
Okay,look,if Leonard finds out that I lied,I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

130
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,010
Physiologically impossible.

131
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,860
Oh,Sheldon,please.

132
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,250
Look,I am asking you as a friend.

133
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,310
So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?

134
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,010
Well,yeah.

135
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,380
Interesting.

136
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,180
One more question,and perhaps I should have led with this.

137
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,890
When did we become friends?

138
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,800
i.e.,I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa,

139
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,980
but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility,I could be Batman.

140
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,000
- You could be Batman? - Sure. I'm Batman. See?

141
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,970
- Hi,guys. - Hi,Penny.

142
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,070
Penny,if you're not doing anything Friday night,I thought maybe we could go see a movie.

143
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,050
Oh,um,you know,I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.

144
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,690
Okay,what about Saturday?

145
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,840
You know,I'm not sure; the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet.

146
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,970
- How about I let you know? - Great.

147
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,950
So you just let me know when you know. Okay,so...

148
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh,God,I am the bad fish.

149
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,210
What did I do wrong?

150
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,350
Why are you asking me?

151
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,690
I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you have provided me,

152
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,100
nor do I have any method of learning such things.

153
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,190
- What does that mean? - Nothing.

154
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,600
You seem to be implying an informational back-channel

155
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,920
between me and Penny where obviously none exists.

156
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,960
No,I didn't.

157
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,720
I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things,sir.

158
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,650
What's going on with you?

159
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,580
I might ask you the same question.

160
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,500
Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me,

161
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,630
but exist between you and Penny, a person to whom I barely speak?

162
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,980
What's wrong with your face?

163
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,280
There's no reason to bring my looks into this.

164
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,760
- Good day,Leonard. - What

165
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,030
I said,"Good day."

166
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,950
Good day?

167
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,930
Also today,we have a fresh-caught Alaska salmon,

168
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,530
and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice.

169
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,300
Our soup of the day is...

170
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,100
You must release me from my oath.

171
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,970
Sheldon,I'm working.

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,870
Why don't you take a minute to decide?

173
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,830
I can't keep your secret,Penny.

174
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,490
I'm going to fold like an energy-based de novo protein in conformational space.

175
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,610
Like a Renaissance tryptich.

176
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,550
Like a cheap suit.

177
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,780
Look,why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?

178
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,860
I'm constitutionally incapable.

179
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,740
That's why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship

180
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,110
at a secret military supercollider located beneath a fake agricultural station

181
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,680
12.5 miles southeast of Traverse City,Michigan.

182
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,310
Which you did not hear about from me.

183
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,050
Look,just forget I told you about me...

184
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,340
not graduating from community college,okay?

185
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,950
Forget? You want me to forget?

186
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,430
This mind does not forget.

187
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,780
I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breastfeeding me.

188
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,140
- It was a drizzly Tuesday. - Okay...

189
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,710
Look,you promised me you would keep my secret,

190
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,990
so you're just gonna have to figure out a way to do it.

191
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,450
Leonard,I'm moving out.

192
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,300
What do you mean you're moving out? Why?

193
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,220
There doesn't have to be a reason.

194
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,080
Yeah,there kinda does.

195
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,320
Not necessarily.

196
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,200
This is a classic example of Munchausen's Trilemma.

197
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,410
Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression,

198
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,790
or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements,

199
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,230
or it's ultimately circular,

200
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
i.e.I'm moving out because I'm moving out.

201
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,790
I'm still confused.

202
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,150
Leonard,I don't see how I could have made it any simpler.

203
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,250
Hey,qu'est que s'up?

204
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,350
We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticized human cadavers.

205
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,580
And some of those skinless chicks were Hot!

206
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,400
If you'll excuse me,I'm going to pack.

207
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,460
That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.

208
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,880
It's not you,Howard. He says he's moving out.

209
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,770
What did you do?

210
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,400
Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?

211
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,000
No.

212
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,730
Did you take a Band-Aid off in front of him?

213
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,710
No.

214
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,230
Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink,

215
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,210
talk to him through the bathroom door?

216
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,330
Adjust the thermostat,cook with cilantro,pronounce the "t" in often?

217
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,830
No.

218
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,670
Did you make fun of trains?

219
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,900
No,I didn't do anything. He's just gone insane.

220
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,960
Well,we all knew this day was coming.

221
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,260
Well,that was fast.

222
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,360
It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag.

223
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,500
It's recommended by the Department of Homeland Security.

224
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,890
And Sarah Connor.

225
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,340
Where are you going to live?

226
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,230
Until I find a permanent place,I will stay with friends.

227
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,500
Bye.

228
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,720
Well... you can't stay with me.

229
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,620
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

230
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,990
Excuse me,but isn't hosting guests an aspect of "manushya yajna,"

231
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,080
one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

232
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,080
I hate trains.

233
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,660
Don't be ridiculous,you love trains.

234
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,570
Yes,I do. Come on.

235
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,670
See you later,Leonard.

236
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,860
This could work.

237
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,840
This is a very old building.

238
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,980
60 years. It used to be a watch factory.

239
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,740
What?

240
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,100
Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?

241
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,120
Not until now!

242
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,710
I can't believe I didn't bring my Geiger counter.

243
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,890
I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it.

244
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,480
Well,if you're not comfortable staying here,Sheldon...

245
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm kidding,I packed it.

246
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,650
It was a joke.

247
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,600
I was subverting the conversational expectations.

248
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,580
I believe they call that the,uh,ol' switcharoo.

249
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,010
Terrific.

250
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,860
Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?

251
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,650
Yes,isn't she an amazing actress?

252
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,260
Actually,I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

253
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,510
How dare you!

254
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,680
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

255
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,310
By comparison,Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

256
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,010
Sorry,I didn't mean to offend you.

257
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,270
Obviously,you're not that familiar with Indian cinema.

258
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,650
Who is it?

259
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,190
Stripper-Gram!

260
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,040
Tag,you're It.

261
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,200
Shouldn't you put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?

262
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,200
I've never slept on an air mattress before.

263
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,570
No lumbar support whatsoever.

264
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,730
Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench.

265
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,280
I don't see any way to get a park bench in here.

266
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,950
Do you want to switch?

267
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,310
No,that's fine.

268
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.

269
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,390
Get out of bed. We're switching.

270
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,570
- Now,only if you want to. - Just get in the bed!

271
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,840
What's going on?

272
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,410
Are you boys roughhousing?

273
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,100
We're just talking,Ma!

274
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,650
If you don't settle down right now,

275
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,650
I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers!

276
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,490
For God's sake,Ma,I'm 27 years old!

277
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,970
And it's not even a school night!

278
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,320
Comfy now?

279
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,570
That poster of Halle Berry is a little unnerving.

280
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,220
So don't look at it.

281
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,320
She's like my fourth favorite Catwoman.

282
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,150
No kidding.

283
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,880
Yeah,Julie Newmar,Michelle Pfieffer,Eartha Kitt,and then her.

284
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,600
What about Lee Merriweather?

285
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,450
Oh,I forgot about Lee Merriweather.

286
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,280
Well,I'm glad that's settled.

287
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,420
That makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite Catwoman.

288
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,460
It's Julie Newmar,Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt,Lee Merriweather--

289
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,760
Please,I'm begging you. Go to sleep.

290
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,190
I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.

291
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,080
She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies,though.

292
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,050
Oh,for God's sake.

293
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,360
She's not my favorite of the X-Men.

294
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,620
In order that would be: Wolverine,Cyclops--

295
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,180
Oh,wait,I forgot Professor X.

296
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,550
Professor X,Wolverine,Cyclops, Iceman,then Storm,Angel,the Beast--

297
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,590
No,wait,Nightcrawler.

298
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,800
Professor X,Nightcrawler,Wolverine, Cyclops,Iceman,then Storm,Angel...

299
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,410
I'm coming!

300
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,200
There he is. There my old buddy bud bud.

301
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,550
What's with him?

302
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,060
Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep,

303
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,880
so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's Valium in it...

304
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,580
but he still wouldn't shut up,so tag,you're It.

305
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,280
I'm ba-a-a-ack.

306
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,480
I still don't know why you left.

307
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,770
I can't tell you.

308
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,090
Why not?

309
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,200
I promised Penny.

310
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,780
You promised Penny what?

311
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,050
I wouldn't tell you the secret.

312
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,530
What secret? Tell me the secret.

313
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,070
Mom smokes in the car.

314
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,180
Jesus is okay with it but we can't tell Dad.

315
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,230
Not that secret. The other secret.

316
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,240
- I'm Batman-- Shh! - Damn it! Sheldon!

317
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,550
You said Penny told you a secret. What's the secret?

318
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,580
Okay,I'll tell you,but you can't tell Leonard.

319
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,790
I promise.

320
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,560
Penny lied about graduating from community college

321
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,650
'cause she's afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard.

322
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,380
So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?

323
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,680
I drank milk that tasted funny.

324
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,570
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her. That's ridiculous.

325
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,190
I know.

326
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,850
Most of your work is extremely derivative.

327
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,780
And don't worry,that's not a secret.

328
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,700
Everybody knows.

329
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,840
Listen,I know what's been bothering you about us,and I have the answer.

330
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,780
What are you talking about?

331
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,490
Okay,first,I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault.

332
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,460
He tried very hard to keep your secret.

333
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,410
If Howard hadn't drugged him,he would've taken it to his grave.

334
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,460
He told you?

335
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,030
Yes,but it's okay.

336
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,080
Now that we know what the problem is there's a simple solution.

337
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,480
Pasadena City College?

338
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,400
A place for fun,a place for knowledge.

339
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,960
See,this man here is playing hackey-sack, and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.

340
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,490
Oh,I get it.

341
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,710
Because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter can't date a girl without a fancy college degree.

342
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,340
Well,it's really not that fancy.

343
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,010
It's just a city college.

344
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,740
Right,but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?

345
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,480
That doesn't matter to me at all.

346
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,160
So it's fine with you if I'm not smart.

347
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,050
Absolutely.

348
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,120
Okay,this time,I know where I went wrong.

349
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,110
Bite me!
