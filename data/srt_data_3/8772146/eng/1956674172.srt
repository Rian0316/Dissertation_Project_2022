taking it off the table?

885
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,126
I... don't know
for sure.

886
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:38,863
It's possible they
have new evidence.

887
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:45,770
Like... Like...
Like.. Like what?

888
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:47,638
Like cameras or...
Or witnesses or...

889
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:49,807
I really couldn't say.

890
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,578
We'll find out
soon enough.

891
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,081
Bobby, I'm sorry.

892
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:00,985
It looks like they want to
make an example out of you.

893
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,955
Uh...

894
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:08,459
All right, well,
we better go tell the judge

895
00:52:08,493 --> 00:52:09,894
that we're taking
this to trial.

896
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,796
Yeah, yeah,
you know what? Um...

897
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,165
Are you sure we still
can't get the five months?

898
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:17,802
The D.A. took that
off the table.

899
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:20,171
You mean if you... Even
if you asked real nice?

900
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,178
I could try.

901
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,780
Are you sure that's
what you want?

902
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:30,881
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

903
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,917
I thought about it,
just like you said, and...

904
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:34,985
I could do
the five months.

905
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:38,889
Miss Wexler, please?

907
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,032
Wait here.

908
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:51,302
I can't promise
anything, but...

909
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:52,370
I'll look into it.

910
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,205
Sure, sure.
You do that.

911
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,174
We'll...
We'll be right here.
