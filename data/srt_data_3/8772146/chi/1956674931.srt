别担心，我在用它。
And don't worry. I'm using it.

437

如果，呃，有人说了什么，

我只说JMM是我的座右铭。

真正的诀窍是让我的客户知道

我还剩了一个完整的手机托盘，
I've still got almost a full pallet of cellphones left,

465
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:14,884
那么，为什么不进行推广呢？
so why not run a promotion?

466
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,220
我要做一个真正的事件。
I-I'll make a real event out of it.

我会把他们送走的，好吗？

还有，呃，为了添加甜味剂。

嗯，非暴力的重罪，50%。
um, non-violent felonies, 50% off.

476
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:42,153
-真的吗？-是的。
- Really? - Yeah.

00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:44,639
我的意思是，这只是让人们进门。
I mean, it's just, get people in the door.

一旦他们上钩了，我就会把他们卖掉。
Once they're hooked, I will up-sell them.

479
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:49,678

480
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,921
你在鼓励这些人犯罪？

他们不需要鼓励。
They don't need encouragement.

00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,455
相信我，一勺还是两勺？
Believe me. One scoop or two?

金姆，你不像我一样知道这些混蛋。

一点折扣也不会有什么不同。
Little discount won't make a bit of difference.

488
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:09,598
你想要洒吗？

当你是对的，你是对的。
When you're right, you're right.

495
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,214
我在做什么来降低价格？
What am I doing cutting prices?

496
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:26,533
折扣是一种绝望的举动。
Discount is a desperation move.

498
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:32,448
看到了吗？
See?

499

我走得太远了。
I go too far.

你不认为你在推销自己吗？

你很努力地想把你的驾照拿回来。
You worked so hard to get your license back.

505

金，我不能再回去当吉米麦吉尔了。

齐格勒开始意识到我们的其他活动。

诱惑太大了，他无法抗拒，

我的耻辱……
My shame...

不仅仅是我允许这样的事情发生。
is not simply that I allowed this to happen.

565
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:05,161
而是我隐瞒了真相。
It's that I hid the truth.

566
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:07,330
当我发现齐格勒的所作所为时，

我的意思是，你说德国人正在建造一些东西。
I mean, you said the German was building something.

575
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,138
什么？
What?

-冷冻鸡肉？-冷冻机。

584
00:30:21,088 --> 00:30:23,589
我们的产品从未冷冻过。
Our product is never frozen.

585
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:27,426
这些是齐格勒的人，按照他的计划工作。
These are Ziegler's men, working from his plans.

586
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:29,745
就他们而言，

有许多误解。
There were any number of misunderstandings.

我的男人不知道谁在跟踪他。
My man didn't know who was following him.

594
00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:54,445
因此，
And as a result,

595
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:57,364
他竭力掩饰自己的行为。

是的，但是去审判将是一个错误。

审判总是不可预测的。

在审讯中，检察官会把一切都扔给我们。

I-I mean, I don't mean to tell you your business, Miss Wexler,

922
00:48:39,973 --> 00:48:41,444

925
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:47,951
-你知道，他们会相信我的。-我相信你。
- y'know, they gonna believe me. - I'd believe you.

鲍比，有一百万个理由不去审判。
Bobby, there are a million reasons not to go to trial.

927
00:48:52,365 --> 00:48:54,699
但这取决于我，对吧？
But it's up to me, right?

928
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:57,869
是的，是的，但我建议你不要这样做。
Yes, it is, but I'm advising you not to.

929
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:01,356
很有可能你会离开更多的时间，
Odds are you would end up going away for more time,

930
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,468
不是更少，我说的是你多年的生活。
not less. And I am talking about years of your life.

931
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:08,305
但我可能不会，对吧？
But I might not, right?

932
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:10,936
你不想冒这个险。
You don't want to take that risk.

933
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:13,217
也许我知道，洛伊斯。
Maybe I do. Lois...

934
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,478
不管鲍比怎么说。
Whatever Bobby says.

936
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,968
失陪一会儿。
Excuse me a moment.

937
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,379
请……
Please...

938
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:26,980
仔细考虑一下。
think this over carefully.

939
00:49:26,982 --> 00:49:29,167
你们俩。
Both of you.

940
00:49:30,777 --> 00:49:32,082
你准备好吃午饭了吗？
You ready for lunch?

941

有一个新的三明治自动售货机
There's a new sandwich vending machine

942
00:49:33,406 --> 00:49:34,527
在家庭法庭上。
down by family court.

943
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:35,976
我听说过好东西。
I've heard good things.

944
00:49:35,978 --> 00:49:37,831
对不起，我被困在这里了。
Sorry, I'm stuck here.

945
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,856
真的吗？怎么了？
Really? What's up?

946
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:41,504
他没有接受这笔交易。
He's not taking the deal.

947
00:49:41,506 --> 00:49:43,414
-谁？那个家伙？
- Who? That guy? -

948
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:45,750
他不是那个想卖东西的朋克
Isn't he the punk who tried to sell

949
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:48,820
一套迷你冰箱给卧底警察的平板？
a flatbed of hot mini-fridges to an undercover cop?

950
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:50,071
你给他买了什么？
What'd you get him?

951
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:51,740
-五个月-五个月？
- Five months. - Five months?

952
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:53,049
有他的前科？！
With his priors?!

953
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:54,909
好吧，他应该跪下来感谢你。
Well, he should be on his knees thanking you.

954
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:56,864
我正试着说服他不要去受审。
I'm trying to talk him out of going to trial.

955
00:49:56,866 --> 00:49:58,339
不！真的吗？
No! Seriously?

956
00:49:58,341 --> 00:50:00,005
说真的。
Seriously.

957
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:01,599
你知道吗？
[SCOFFS] You know what?

958
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,175
不叹息。
[SIGHS] No.

959
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:05,420
不，我们可以解决这个问题。
No. We can fix this.

960
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:08,301
我来自D.A.的办公室，好吗？
I'm from the D.A.'s office, okay?

961
00:50:08,303 --> 00:50:09,545
我给你的是什么。
I'm giving you what for.

962
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:10,742
你给我的是什么。
You're giving me what for.

963
00:50:10,744 --> 00:50:12,535
我们会大声的，我们到那边去。
We'll be loud. We will go over there.

964
00:50:12,537 --> 00:50:14,019
我们会创造一个场景，好吗？
We will make a scene, okay?

965
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:15,242
呃。
Uh...

966
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:16,822
新的证据浮出了，
new evidence has come to light,

967
00:50:16,824 --> 00:50:19,934
我正以极端的偏见来处理他的交易。
and I'm pulling his deal with extreme prejudice.

968
00:50:19,936 --> 00:50:21,193
我很生气。
I-I'm pissed.

969
00:50:21,195 --> 00:50:23,955
我想永久地把他关起来。
I wanna put him away permanently.

971
00:50:25,533 --> 00:50:28,109
。三级重罪。
-  ... third-degree felony...

973
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:32,013
但是你和我打架，我会努力的。
But you fight me, I will push back hard.

974
00:50:32,015 --> 00:50:33,723
我们会让那个朋克跪在他的膝盖上
We'll have that punk on his knees

975
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:35,541
乞求五个月。
begging for the five months.


977
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:41,187
-我不这么认为。-是的，来吧，金姆。
- I don't think so. - Yeah, come on, Kim.

978
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:43,012
我们可以这样做。铅管。
We can do this. Lead-pipe cinch.

979
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:44,717
他是客户，这是他的决定。
He's the client. It's his decision.

980
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:46,069
它会有什么好处呢
What good is it gonna do

981
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:48,312
把那个dweeb放在洛斯兰，对吧？
to put that dweeb away in Los Lunas, huh?

982
00:50:48,314 --> 00:50:49,948
你觉得他现在是个混蛋？
You think he's a jackass now?

983
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,300
等他从那个小丑学院回来。
Wait till he gets back from that clown college.

984
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:55,071
-吉米，不。-是的，但是他的妻子和孩子呢？
- Jimmy, it... No. - Yeah, but what about his wife and kid?

985
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:56,671
那是他们，对吧？他们怎么样？
That's them, right? What about them?

986
00:50:56,673 --> 00:50:59,157
如果这不是用我们的力量做善事，我不知道那是什么。
If this isn't using our powers for good, I don't know what is.

987
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,900
-我们不会那样做。-但是，金，我们能做到。
- We're not doing that. - But, Kim, we can do it.

988
00:51:00,902 --> 00:51:02,377
-它会起作用的-我不是在欺骗我的客户。
- It'll work. - I am not scamming my client.

989
00:51:02,379 --> 00:51:03,903
但它对梅萨维德很有效。
But it worked for Mesa Verde...

990
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:05,830
吉米，退后。
Jimmy, back off.

991
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:08,483
嗯，y。
Well, y...

992
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:10,802
好的。
 Okay.

994
00:51:14,056 --> 00:51:15,671
嗯…
Um...

995
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:19,752
是的，我在家里见你。
yeah, I'll see you at home.

997
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,034
那是谁？
So... who was that?

998
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:41,291
一切都好吗？
Is everything alright?

1000
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:49,373
他来自地区检察官办公室。
He's from the district attorney's office.

1001
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,210
他们把交易取消了。
They're taking the deal off the table.

1002
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:53,636
呃，那又怎样？
Uh, so what?

1003
00:51:53,638 --> 00:51:57,215
我的意思是，我们不会接受它，所以。
I mean, we weren't gonna take it anyway, so...

1004
00:51:57,217 --> 00:52:00,741
韦克斯勒小姐，为什么他们要把它从桌子上拿下来？
Miss Wexler, why are they taking it off the table?

1005
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:04,359
我……不确定。
I... don't know for sure.

1006
00:52:04,361 --> 00:52:07,404
有可能他们有新的证据。
It's possible they have new evidence.

1007
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,472
就像……喜欢……喜欢什么？
Like... Like... Like... Like what?

1008
00:52:13,474 --> 00:52:16,234
就像……像……照相机，……或……或目击者或……
Like... Like... cameras or... or... or witnesses or...

1009
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:19,070
我真的不能说。
I really couldn't say.

1010
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:22,499
我们很快就会知道的。
We'll find out soon enough.

1011
00:52:24,077 --> 00:52:26,561
博比，我很抱歉。
Bobby, I'm sorry.

1012
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:29,297
看起来他们想要以你为榜样。
It looks like they want to make an example out of you.

1013
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:33,325
呃。
Uh...

1014
00:52:33,327 --> 00:52:36,198
好吧，我们最好去告诉法官
Alright, well, we better go tell the judge

1015
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,966
我们要把它带到审判中去。
that we're taking this to trial.

1016
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:39,164
是的，你。你知道吗？
Yeah, yeah, you... you know what?

1017
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:43,353
嗯……你确定我们还不能得到五个月的时间吗？
Um... are you sure we still can't get the five months?

1018
00:52:43,355 --> 00:52:45,930
D.A.把它从桌子上拿走了。
The D.A. took that off the table.

1019
00:52:45,932 --> 00:52:48,733
你的意思是如果你……即使你问的很好？
You mean if you... even if you asked real nice?

1020
00:52:53,323 --> 00:52:55,621
我可以试试。
I could try.

1021
00:52:55,623 --> 00:52:58,038
你确定这就是你想要的吗？
Are you sure that's what you want?

1022
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,102
是的，是的，我想过，
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I-I thought about it,

1023
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,113
就像你说的，还有。
just like you said, and...

1024
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:04,599
我可以做五个月。
I could do the five months.

1025
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:07,151
Wexler小姐。请问？
Miss Wexler... please?

1027
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:16,611
在这里等着。
Wait here.

1028
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:19,447
我不能保证什么，但是……
I can't promise anything, but...

1029
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:20,709
我来查一下。
I'll look into it.

1030
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:23,902
当然，当然，你这样做。
Sure, sure. Y-You do that.

1031
00:53:23,904 --> 00:53:27,331
我们会。我们就在这里。
We'll... We'll be right here.
