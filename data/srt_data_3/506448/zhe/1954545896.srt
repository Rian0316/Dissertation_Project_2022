我打不开门

00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,766
没有钥匙

我去找医生 还有警察
I'm going out for a doctor, and the police.

25
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:37,818
驼背人案

尤其平叛那两次 大获全胜

约翰・华生医生 前陆军军医

00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,043
隶属波克夏步兵团

34
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,503
现在是私人医师

35
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,088
墨斐 副将
Murphy, second in command,

36
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,799
暂时接管麦洛斯步兵团
temporarily in charge of the Royal Mallows,

37
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,177
由于我们上校惨死一事
following the, tragedy of our Colonel's death.

38
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,262
这位一定是福尔摩斯先生?
And this will be Mr. Holmes?

39
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,847
请进
Please.

40
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,272
您能及时赶到真是太好了
It's good of you to come so swiftly.

41
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,940
别客气
Not at all.

42
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,526
我向福尔摩斯解释了您一定
I have explained to Holmes how concerned

43
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,071
为可能形成的丑闻十分忧虑
you must be about the possibility of a scandal.

44
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,909
多谢
Thank you.

45
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:06,371
我很担心我们团的荣誉
The honor of the regiment is in my care.

46
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,833
但是 报纸上的报道暗示
And yet, the newspapers report suggest

47
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,544
丑闻是不可避免的
that a scandal is inevitable.

48
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,004
当然不会
Surely not.

49
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,923
我已经竭尽全力将记者
I've done my utmost to make sure that reporters

50
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,799
挡在事态之外
were kept as far away as possible.

51
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,052
当然 这样会让他们更加怀疑
Exactly, and that is what has made them suspicious.

52
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,596
他们嗅到了秘密 这会让他们的
They scent a mystery, that much is clear

53
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,141
轻描淡写变成大做文章
from the little they have been able to say.

54
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,729
当然 不应该反反复复
Surely, it would be wrong to repeat,

55
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,565
招惹他们注意...
to draw attention to -

56
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,569
的确
Quite.

57
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:47,204
我们非常需要您的帮助 福尔摩斯先生
You see how much we need your help, Mr. Holmes.

58
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,041
你觉得如何 福尔摩斯?
What do you say, Holmes?

59
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,127
还能如何?
What can I say?

60
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,881
墨斐少校 您说的都是废话
Major Murphy, you have told me nothing.

61
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,383
我来奥尔德肖特
I have come down here

62
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,177
是受我的朋友劝说
after persuasion from my friend, to Aldershot,

63
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,430
他比我要更热心军队的事
who has more interest in military matters than I.

64
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:17,442
现在我来了 就请告诉我实情
Now that I am here, please tell me the facts.

65
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,695
本团司令官
The commanding officer of this regiment,

66
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,154
詹姆斯・巴克利上校
Colonel James Barclay,

67
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,948
被发现死在家中
was found dead in his villa

68
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,784
就在前天夜里10点
at about 10 o'clock the night before last.

69
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,245
发现尸体的是列兵贝茨
The body was found by Private Bates,

70
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,789
他的勤务兵 尸体躺在起居室里
his batman, lying in the morning room.

71
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,167
有一条两寸长的不规则伤口
There was a ragged cut, two-inches long,

72
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,793
嵌在他脑后
on the back of his head,

73
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,087
显然是被猛击造成的
which had evidently been caused by a violent blow

74
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,714
凶器是钝器
from a blunt instrument.

75
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,674
尸体旁的地板上
And upon the floor by the body

76
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:47,681
有根手工制作的木质棍子
was a singular hand-carved wooden club.

77
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,309
还有 沙发上躺着
Also, stretched out on the sofa

78
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,978
晕厥过去的南希・巴...
lying in a dead faint, was Nancy Bar -

79
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,814
巴克利夫人
Mrs. Barclay.

80
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:01,653
请继续 墨斐少校
Please continue, Major Murphy.

81
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,739
仆人留意到这场悲剧
The servants had been alerted to the tragedy

82
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,407
是因为巴克利上校夫妇
by the sounds of a quarrel

83
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,659
发生了激烈争吵
between the Colonel and Mrs. Barclay.

84
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,578
他们试着闯进起居室
They tried to enter the morning room

85
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,163
却发现门锁上了
but found it locked.

86
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,040
贝茨不得不绕到花园里
Bates had to go around by the garden

87
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,708
从落地窗进去
and get in through the french windows.

88
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,627
而现在您怀疑是巴克利夫人干的?
And now you suspect Mrs. Barclay?

89
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,836
是的
Yes.

90
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,505
但她没能力
But she is quite incapable

91
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,217
做出如此可怕的举动
of such a dreadful act.

92
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,010
我做已故上校
I have been the late Colonel's

93
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,970
的副将很多年了
second in command for a number of years.

94
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:32,017
我了解南希・巴克利
I've come to know Nancy Barclay well.

95
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:37,314
当然
Of course.

96
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,691
跟我说说巴克利上校
Tell me about Colonel Barclay,

97
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,487
他是否受到手下士兵们的敬重?
was he highly regarded by the men under his command?

98
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,990
考虑到他的背景 算很敬重了
Considering his background, remarkably so.

99
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,035
他的背景 怎么 他有不光彩的过去?
His background, why, was he ever disgraced?

100
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,955
不 但外界通常不知道
No, but it's not generally known outside

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,916
吉姆・巴克利的军旅生涯
that Jim Barclay began his career

102
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,836
始于麦洛斯团普通列兵
as a private soldier in the Mallows.

103
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,004
这是真的?
Did he, indeed?

104
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,798
从列兵晋升到司令官
From private soldier to commanding officer

105
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,383
在同一个团里
in the same regiment,

106
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,885
这可是罕见的成就
that's a rare achievement.

107
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,387
是他在印度叛乱中展现的勇气
I was his gallantry in the Indian Mutiny

108
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,514
让他赢得了这个职位
that got him his commission,

109
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:15,602
之后的几年他连升三级
and then quite rapid promotion over the years,

110
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,439
我得说 比我快得多
more rapid than mine, for instance.

111
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,734
令人印象深刻
Impressive.

112
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,946
我猜不幸的巴克利夫人被拘留了吧?
And I suppose the unfortunate Mrs. Barclay is in custody?

113
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,075
不 不完全是 不是的
No, not exactly, no.

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,619
她在住院 被严密看管
She's in hospital, being looked after,

115
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,788
警官就站在床边
with a police constable standing by.

116
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,128
南希・巴克利现在是个大方的女人
Nancy Barclay is a handsome woman now,

117
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,713
但你应该看看她
but you should have seen her

118
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:49,428
年轻时在印度 30年前的样子
as a young girl in India, 30 years ago.

119
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,306
她是军团的女儿
She was a daughter of the regiment.

120
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:56,894
她父亲是团部的军士长 RSM・迪威艾
Her father was the Regimental Sergeant Major, RSM Devoy,

121
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:03,108
这么个岳父足以吓倒任何士兵
and therefore quite a formidable father-in-law for any soldier.

122
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,277
我记得我们一个连的弟兄
I remember that all the men in my company

123
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:09,615
都认为她是驻军里最漂亮的女孩
thought her quite the prettiest girl in the garrison.

124
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,909
还是尉官的我 跟她接触不多
As a junior officer I had little to do with her,

125
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,120
但我清楚她是最有魅力
but I was aware that she was a most charming,

126
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,666
最活泼而勇敢的女孩
most vivacious and spirited girl.

127
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,134
理所当然
It was quite understandable

128
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,678
巴克利并非团里唯一一个想
that Barclay was not the only man in the regiment

129
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,306
执子之手的人
who sought her hand.

130
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,143
但最终 她选择了他
But, in the end, he was the one she chose.

131
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,319
他们在伯第结的婚 1858年的夏天
They were married at Bhurtee,

132
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,780
离科尔普不远 之前几个月
not far from Cornpor a few months after

133
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,657
那块被围攻的驻军地
the besieged garrison there

134
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,825
刚被被尼尔将军的纵队解救
was relieved by General Neill's column

135
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,161
时值1858年夏天
in the summer of 1858.

136
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,705
婚后不久
Shortly after the marriage,

137
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:03,252
巴克利中士不出所料 受到了委任
Sergeant Barclay got his commission, as expected.

138
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,837
巴克利一家
It must have been difficult

139
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,880
起先一定很受危难
for the Barclays at first,

140
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,216
一个军士 在行伍中被晋升
NCO, promoted from the ranks,

141
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,219
作为军士长的女婿?
married to a regimental Sergeant Major's daughter?

142
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:18,016
是的 我相信的确有些社会摩擦
Yes, I believe there was some little social friction.

143
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,272
但是 南希以高贵和魅力忍耐
But, Nancy carried it off with dignity and charm,

144
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,316
他们很快就被大家接受了
and they gained acceptance in no time.

145
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,652
巴克利的事业蒸蒸日上
Barclay's career flourished,

146
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:33,073
部队5年前撤出印度
and the regiment returned from India some five years ago.

147
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,369
之后巴克利被委任为司令官
Barclay was then appointed to commanding officer.

148
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:41,540
他们的婚姻生活仍旧很幸福?
And the marriage continued to be a happy one?

149
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,877
看起来是那样
It appeared to be so.

150
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,253
看起来?
Appeared?

151
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,046
大多数人相信他们的婚姻
Most people believe the marriage

152
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,718
一直是幸福美满的
to have been a uniformly happy one.

153
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:57,264
那您认为呢 墨斐少校?
And what do you believe, Major Murphy?

154
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,850
作为副将的我
My position as second in command

155
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,644
经常因公拜访巴克利夫妇
often took me to the Barclay's house.

156
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,274
我看到他们婚姻的另一面
I saw a different side to the marriage.

157
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,235
真相的重要性
The truth is more important

158
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,656
远超过您对前任长官的忠诚
than loyalty to your late commander.

159
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,868
有一晚 我在巴克利夫妇家中用餐
One night I had been dining at the Barclays.

160
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,162
出门走到车道尽头
It wasn't until I reached the end of the drive

161
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,331
才发觉自己把雪茄盒
that I realized I'd left my cigar case

162
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,208
落在餐室里了
in the dining room.

163
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,753
我回去的时候 大门还是敞开的
I went back, the front door was still open;

164
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,088
简 那个女仆 在门厅里
Jane, the maid, was in the hall.

165
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,383
真庆幸你还在这儿
I'm glad you're still here,

166
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,093
我把雪茄盒落在桌子上了
I left my cigar case on the table.

167
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,762
我想巴克利上校夫妇
I think the Colonel and Mrs. Barclay

168
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,597
已经就寝了 先生
have gone to bed, sir.

169
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,599
哦 看在上帝的份上 简
Oh, for goodness sake, James.

170
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,559
坦白吧 是谁 谁?
Confess then, who is it, who?

171
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:47,231
放开我 你弄疼我了
Let go of me, you're hurting me.

172
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,107
那就告诉我你爱我
Tell me you love me then,

173
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,692
只爱我一个人
me and nobody else.

174
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,444
听到我说的吗 听到没有?
Do you hear, do you hear me?

175
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,572
哦 如果不爱你我又为什么嫁给你?
Oh, would I have married you if I didn't?

176
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:59,076
我不知道 有时候我也想不通
I don't know, sometimes I wonder.

177
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,168
这些猜忌的表现
And this expression of jealousy

178
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,921
墨斐少校 就在您离开他们家
occurred within seconds of you, Major Murphy,

179
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,756
几秒内爆发
leaving the Barclays' house.

180
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,842
告诉我关于上校的事
Tell me about the Colonel,

181
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,345
他是否是个暴力的人?
was he a violent man in any way?

182
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,514
偶尔为之
On occasion.

183
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,140
他会十分残暴地
He could be most vindictive

184
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,810
对付中尉们
towards young subalterns.

185
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,146
但他是一步一步爬到这个位置的
But he'd clawed his way to the top,

186
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,732
走到这步就必须变得残暴
you need to be ruthless to do that.

187
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,234
你肯定他作为司令官
Surely he didn't still feel

188
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,194
不觉得不适应?
out of place as an officer?

189
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,154
不 我不这么认为
No, I don't think so,

190
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,490
但他被一种特殊的抑郁困扰着
but he was subject to a peculiar form of depression.

191
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,954
敬女王
The Queen.

192
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,636
有时在我们讨论以往的战役时
Sometimes when we were discussing old campaigns,

193
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,599
总督 叛乱 阿富汗战争
the premier, the Mutiny, Afghan War,

194
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:07,519
他会突然笑意尽失
the smile would often be struck from his mouth

195
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:11,565
像被无形之手扯了下来
as if by some invisible hand.

196
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,200
是的 长期服役于印度
Yes, long service in India

197
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,202
会产生这种症状
can have that effect.

198
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,579
我在波克夏的时候见过
I saw that when I was in the Berkshires.

199
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,207
你提到一根木质棍子
You mentioned a carved wooden club

200
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,375
落在尸体旁
found by the body,

201
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,670
是上校自印度带回来的纪念品吗?
one of the Colonel's Indian souvenirs?

202
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,214
我相信仆人们会说
I believe the servants deny

203
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,716
从未见过这根棍子
ever having seen this club before.

204
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,968
当然 我拜访时也从未见过
Certainly I've never seen it on any of my visits.

205
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,262
它相当的长
It was quite long.

206
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,264
那么警方 我猜
And the police, I suppose,

207
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,016
有没有将其扣押检察?
have retained it for examination?

208
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,476
有
Yes.

209
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,436
他们认为那就是凶器
They believe it to be the murder weapon.

210
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,313
他们这么认为?
Do they, indeed?

211
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,148
我想我们该首先
I think we should begin

212
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,067
动身去巴克利宅
by visiting the Barclays' house,

213
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,693
不过首先 当然
unless, of course,

214
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,488
是否有可能与巴克利夫人面谈?
it is possible to interview Mrs. Barclay?

215
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,659
恐怕她仍在昏迷之中
I'm afraid she's still unconscious.

216
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,494
如我所料
I thought as much.

217
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:17,756
大卫 大卫
David, David.

218
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,195
多么美妙的早晨啊
What a beautiful morning.

219
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,490
福尔摩斯 是不是巴克利夫人
Holmes, suppose Mrs. Barclay

220
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,994
红杏出墙 上校发现了?
had a lover and the Colonel had found out?

221
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,915
墨斐少校看起来和她相当亲近
Major Murphy seems to have been rather close to her.

222
00:13:43,998 --> 00:13:47,210
你知道 轻微的通奸行为
You know, mild adultery

223
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:48,878
一直是老生常谈
has always been commonplace

224
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,797
在热带军官夫妇间
among officers and their wives

225
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,132
时有发生
serving in hot climates.

226
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,509
谢谢 华生
Thank you, Watson,

227
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,345
教会了我军队里的道德
for educating me in military morality.

228
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,888
如果真有什么特殊关系
If there had been anything

229
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:00,973
在墨斐少校和巴克利夫人之间
between Major Murphy and Mrs. Barclay,

230
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:02,892
他又怎么会提起
would he have related the incident

231
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:04,644
忘记雪茄盒这件事呢?
of his forgotten cigar case?

232
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,278
大概是在7点半左右 先生
I was about half past seven, sir,

233
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:57,405
我在餐桌边等着
and I was waiting a table.

234
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,906
巴克利夫人每月的那晚
Once a month, Mrs. Barclay spent

235
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,285
都要去奥尔德肖特做慈善事业
the evening doing charity work in Aldershot.

236
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:41,532
你这么着急是要去哪里?
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

237
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:46,120
8点钟开始发放衣物
Well, the distribution of old clothing starts at 8 o'clock,

238
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,498
我向安・莫里森允诺过
and I promised Ann Morrison

239
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:51,584
我会按时到达工作厅
I'd be at the mission hall on time.

240
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,253
好吧 如果你想因此感染恶疾
Well, if you want to catch some filthy disease

241
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:57,298
上上下下沾满跳蚤的话
dealing with a lot of flea ridden down and outs,

242
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,883
我想那是你的事
I suppose that's your affair.

243
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:00,551
我深信人要懂得
I believe in putting back into life

244
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:03,054
知恩图报
as much as one gets out of it.

245
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:07,433
我们的命运如此幸运
We've been fortunate with our lot;

246
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:13,981
其他人就没这么好运了
others haven't been so lucky.

247
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,983
别太晚回来
Don't be late back.

248
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,653
当然不会

249

巴克利夫人回来的时候
Mrs. Barclay must have returned

250

一定有9点一刻了 先生
about quarter past nine, sir.

00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:39,340
我那时在厨房帮厨师洗盘子
I was in the kitchen helping the cook with the dishes.

252

远处传来轰轰的雷声
There was thunder in the distance,

253
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,136
我正对范尼夫人说着
and I was just saying to Mrs. Fenning

254
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:45,096
暴风雨即将来临的时候
that there was a storm brewing,

255
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:47,181
起居室有人拉铃
when the morning room bell rang.

256
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:51,269
我上楼后发现巴克利夫人已经归来

257
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:53,813
她在房间里来回踱步 先生
She was walking up and down this room, sir,

258
00:16:53,896 --> 00:17:00,820
面无血色 心烦意乱
very pale, upset.

259
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:05,324
她看起来糟透了 先生
She looked awful, sir.

260
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,790
您叫我 夫人?
You rang, madam?

261
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:18,004
是的 简 给我沏杯茶 好吗?
Yes, Jane, bring me some tea, will you?

262
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:21,716
好的 夫人
Of course, madam.

263
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:39,108
简 是你吗?
Jane, is that you?

264
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:42,612
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

265
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:45,948
我是否听到了巴克利夫人回来的声音?
Did I hear Mrs. Barclay come in?

266
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:49,327
是的 先生 她在起居室
Yes, sir, she's in the morning room.

267

Yes, sir.

269
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,415
我正准备去给她泡茶
I'm just about to take her a pot of tea.

270
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,963
茶? 这么晚了她喝茶做什么?
Tea? what does she want tea for at this hour?

271
00:18:16,604 --> 00:18:17,897
我推测 这次
And that, presumably,

272
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:21,359
是最后有人见到活着的巴克利上校?
was the last time that anyone saw Colonel Barclay alive?

273
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:24,696
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

274
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,156
你能想到任何原因
Can you think of any reason

275

让你的女主人大半夜
why your mistress came into this morning room

276
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,288
走进没有炉火的起居室吗?
at that time of night, when the fire was unlit?

277
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,873
不 先生
No, sir.

278
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:37,750
她经常会出刻意
Did she often make a point

279
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:42,130
避开上校吗?
of purposely avoiding the Colonel?

280
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:47,760
你之前听到过他们争吵吗?
Had you ever heard them arguing before?

281
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:53,141
据我所知没有 先生
Not to my knowledge, sir.

282
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,976
当你从厨房回来
When you returned from the kitchen

283
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,145
端着巴克利夫人的茶

你发现门被锁上了
you found the door locked,

你到底听到了什么?
Now, what exactly did you hear?

他们在争吵 先生
They were arguing, sir.

288
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:11,868
巴克利夫人骂上校是个懦夫

00:19:11,993 --> 00:19:16,247
她说"这些年来你毁了我的一生"
She said you have ruined my life all these years.

290
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:19,625
巴克利夫人大喊着"大卫"这个名字
Mrs. Barclay shouted the name "David,"

291
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:23,671
她喊了两次
she said it twice.

292
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,840
大卫?
David?

293
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,467
你确定吗?
Could you swear to that?

294
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,802
我听得很清楚 先生
I was perfectly clear, sir.

295
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:33,222
但上校的名字是詹姆斯
But the Colonel's name was James.

296
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:34,640
你曾经听到
Have you ever heard

巴克利夫人提到过叫大卫的人吗?

298
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:40,021
没有 先生 我认为她和上校
No, sir, I don't think she or the Colonel

299
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:41,981
都不认识任何叫大卫的人

300
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:46,694
墨斐少校的教名是帕特里克

他们最近有没有叫

302
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,948

by the name of David?

303
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:53,910
我想没有 先生
I don't think so, sir.

304
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,204
找到的那根棍子
The club that was found

305
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,831
扔在尸体旁边的
by Colonel Barclay's body,

306
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:00,833
你以前见过吗?
had you seen it before?

307
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,418
没有 先生
No, sir.

308
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:04,170
上校有很多印度带回来的战利品
The Colonel had several trophies from India,

309
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:07,507
但没有那根棍子
but nothing like that club.

310
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:10,510
你确定吗 斯图尔特小姐?
Are you sure of that, Miss Stewart?

311
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,053
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

312
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:17,934
我不知道它是从哪来的
I don't know where it came from.

313
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:23,022
谢谢 我问完了
Thank you, that is all.

314
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:26,484
哦 不 还有最后一个问题
Oh, no, there is just one last thing,

315
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,653
墨斐少校落在这儿的雪茄盒
Major Murphy once left his cigar case here,

316
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:31,030
你找到了没有?
did you manage to find it?

317
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:33,908
找到了 先生
Yes, sir.

318
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:48,214
上校就躺在这里 先生
The Colonel was lying down here, sir.

319
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:50,091
头抵着壁炉架?
With his head by the fender?

320
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,218
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

321
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:56,139
血迹仍清晰可见
You can see the mark of the blood still.

322
00:20:56,264 --> 00:21:00,435
但最恐怖的事 先生 是他的脸
But the most frightening thing of all, sir, was his face.

323
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,936
他的脸?
His face?

324
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,813
当我把他翻过来时
When I rolled him over.

325
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:07,900
我一看差点吓晕过去
I almost fainted away to look upon it.

326
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:12,280
他的脸完全扭曲了 非常狰狞
It was all contorted, screwed up,

327
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:17,201
带着恐惧到极点的表情
with the most horrible look of fear and terror.

328
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:23,374
就像他预见到自己的死期一样?
As if he'd foreseen his own death?

329
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,586
很有可能 先生
Quite possible, sir.

330
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:31,299
谢谢你 贝茨
Thank you, Bates.

331
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,302
是什么幻影 什么鬼怪
What apparition, what monster was it

332
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:39,599
能让上校如此畏惧
that could have frightened the Colonel so.

333
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:44,187
肯定不是南希・巴克利
Not Nancy Barclay, for sure.

334
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,147
门被反锁了 先生
This door was locked shut, sir,

335
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:51,152
而且 钥匙不见了
and what's more, the key was missing.

336
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,029
不见了?
Missing?

337
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:55,114
是的 最后我们不得不
Yes, in the end we had to send

338
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,283
请锁匠来把门打开
for a locksmith to open it.

339
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,619
你们彻底找过那把钥匙吗?
You have made a thorough search for the key?

340
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:01,245
我们已经掘地三尺了
We searched high and low.

341
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:02,872
巴克利夫人没拿着
Mrs. Barclay hadn't got it,

342
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:05,166
也不在上校衣兜里 先生
and it wasn't in the Colonel's pocket, sir.

343
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:10,963
多谢 范尼夫人
Thank you, Mrs. Fenning.

344
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:17,136
华生 如果钥匙不在门上
Watson, if the key was not in the door,

345
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,684
也不在巴克利夫人和上校身上 那么...
and neither Mrs. Barclay nor the Colonel had it, then -

346
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,439
屋里肯定有第三个人
Then there must have been a third person.

347
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:35,196
完全正确
Exactly,

348
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:45,581
他从落地窗进来 或者出去
who either entered or left through those windows.

349
00:22:51,713 --> 00:22:59,262
这些是贝茨的脚印
These are Bates' footprints.

350
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:03,182
但这些 是另一个人的脚印
But these, are the footprints of someone else.

351
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:07,311
有人最近穿越过草地
Someone has recently crossed this lawn,

352
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:10,773
痕迹非常清晰
the marks are just visible.

353
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:28,499
他从落地窗进去 又原路出来 华生
He entered and left through those windows, Watson,

354
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,710
我们找对方向了
we're on the right search.

355
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:41,929
华生 快看这个
Watson, look at this.

356
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:43,556
这是什么?
What is it?

357
00:23:43,681 --> 00:23:46,434
我们的对手有个不太寻常的伙伴
Our entrant had a somewhat unusual companion.

358
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,103
是只狗 对吧? 有个人养狗
It's a dog, isn't it, somebody's dog?

359
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,813
哪有人听说过会
Whoever heard of a dog

360
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:52,523
爬上床帘的狗
running up a curtain.

361
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:54,400
那是不是猫?
What about a cat then?

362
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:56,527
这些爪印不是猫的
These claw marks are not those of a cat,

363
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:58,488
也不是猴子 或是任何一种
nor of a monkey, nor of any creature

364
00:23:58,613 --> 00:24:00,740
我们熟悉的生物
that we are familiar with.

365
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:04,911
我想前后蹄之间的距离
I would think from hind foot to forefoot

366
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:08,081
至少有15英寸
at least 15 inches.

367
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:10,249
加上头颈的长度
Add to that the length of neck and head,

368
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,169
这个动物不少于两英尺长
you have a creature no less than two feet,

369
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:15,421
加上尾巴就更长
more if there's a tail.

370
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:17,465
它的步幅很奇特
The length of its stride is odd,

371
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,009
这暗示着它
it indicates a creature

372
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:22,387
背部修长 腿部短小
with a long back and short legs.

373
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,681
像鼬或黄鼠狼之类的动物?
Something like a stoat or a weasel?

374
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:27,892
同时我们知道它是食肉动物
We also know that it is carnivorous.

375
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:30,103
你怎么看出来的?
How can you tell that?

376
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:35,274
你看看它爬上床帘是为什么
Well you see what made it run up the curtain.

377
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:36,859
金丝雀
The canary.

378
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:38,986
正是
Exactly.

379
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:41,197
到底是什么动物?
Then what was this beast?

380
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:54,043
不 我不能 我不能背叛我的朋友
No, I can't, I cannot betray a friend,

381
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:57,547
请不要逼我
please don't ask me to.

382
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,689
莫里森小姐
Miss Morrison,

383
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:21,112
当巴克利夫人前日晚来到这里时
when Mrs. Barclay left her house to come here two nights ago,

384
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:25,658
她很快乐而满足
she was happy and content.

385
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:27,243
但两小时后 她回去的时候
When she returned two hours later,

386
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:28,661
却完全变了样
she was a changed woman.

387
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:33,916
现在警方怀疑她是凶手
Now the police suspect her of murder.

388
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:38,338
你有责任澄清你朋友的名声
You owe it to your friend to clear her name.

389
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:40,673
你必须告诉我那晚什么事
You must tell me what happened last night

390
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,010
彻底改变了她
that so changed her.

391
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:49,432
很好 我愿意打破沉默
Very well, I shall break my promise of silence

392
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:53,394
如果真能对她有所帮助
if what I can say can really help her.

393
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,689
的确有事发生
So there was something.

394
00:25:56,814 --> 00:26:00,234
事情十分异乎寻常
It was most bizarre.

395
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:02,070
我得说我们在这儿见过
I should explain that we come across

396
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:05,990
各种各样穷困潦倒的人
all sorts of conditions of men here.

397
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,450
然而 那一晚
Yet, the other night,

398
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:09,535
我看到了从未见过的
I saw the most extraordinary creature

399
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:12,705
最奇特的一位
I have ever seen.

400
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,626
他不仅驼背
Not only had he a crooked back,

401
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,878
脚还是跛的
but he was lame

402
00:26:19,003 --> 00:26:22,507
走路时曲着膝盖
and walked with his knees bent.

403
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,093
他面色黧黑
His face was darkly tanned,

404
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:28,137
干瘪褶皱得像烂苹果一样
crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.

405
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:29,806
那时我想 果真
I thought to myself that truly

406
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:31,724
这世上还有如此
there are some of us on this earth

407
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,726
不堪重负
who are burdened with more than

408
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,854
被命运遗弃的人
their fair share of misfortune.

409
00:26:36,938 --> 00:26:39,440
更显得奇异的是
This vision was made more unusual

410
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:47,240
那人还一身东方打扮
by the oriental garb the man was wearing.

411
00:26:47,323 --> 00:26:51,411
我指给南希看
I pointed this person out to Nancy

412
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:58,876
那个人似乎特别需要帮助
as someone especially deserving of help.

413
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,630
南希那晚精神很不错
Nancy had indeed been in good spirits that evening,

414
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,090
我看到她走近那个男人
and I saw her go towards the man

415
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:12,015
询问他是否需要照顾
and ask him if he needed assistance.

416
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,269
就是这时候 南希起了变化
It was now that a change came over Nancy.

417
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:18,730
她与那个男人谈了几句
She had begun a conversation with the man when suddenly

418
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:22,108
脸色骤然苍白
all the color drained from her face.

419
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:25,611
看起来像见鬼了似的
She looked as though she had seen a ghost.

420
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:27,989
那个男人似乎也受到很大影响
The man, too, seemed to be strangely affected

421
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,949
见到她的脸
by the sight of her,

422
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:33,119
我见他不断使劲挥手
and I saw him gesticulating wildly.

423
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:35,955
然后 南希和那男人在大厅
Well, Nancy and the man went to a quiet corner

424
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,750
找了个安静角落谈话
of the hall and they talked together

425
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,168
谈了一些时候
for a few moments or so

426
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:42,462
我听到那个男人一声怒吼
before I heard an angry shout from the man

427
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:47,258
接着看到他挥舞着拳头 冲出门去
and saw him storm out, waving his fists in the air.

428
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,898
南希 怎么了
Nancy, what is it,

429
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:04,650
你还好吧?
are you all right?

430
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:07,820
那个可怜的家伙是谁?
Who was that poor creature?

431
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:09,781
是我的一个旧相识
It's an old acquaintance of mine

432
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:13,284
现在落魄了
fallen on hard times.

433
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:15,078
答应我 安妮 你不会把这事
Promise me, Annie, you won't say anything

434
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:17,997
告诉任何人 答应我
about this to anyone, promise me.

435
00:28:18,122 --> 00:28:26,798
当然 我答应 只要是你的要求
Of course, I promise, if you so wish.

436
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:30,301
那这个男人的身份呢?
And the identity of this man?

437
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:33,304
我猜你就会这么问
I thought you might ask me that.

438
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:37,225
这件可怕的事发生之后 南希离开了
Well, after this terrible happening, Nancy left.

439
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,102
我自然去问了问
I naturally made a few inquiries

440
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:41,145
常来的那些人
among some of the regulars;

441
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:43,898
如此与众不同的人
such an unusual looking creature

442
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,734
当然很引人注意
has of course attracted attention.

443
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,822
原来他是最近从印度回来的老兵
It appears he is an old soldier recently back from India,

444
00:28:50,905 --> 00:28:52,573
谁也不熟悉
and no one knows anything else

445
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:54,450
他的身世背景
about his background

446
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:56,411
只知道他是靠
except that he makes a living

447
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:59,664
给部队逗乐 变戏法
by entertaining the troops, conjuring tricks,

448
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:03,960
之类手段谋生
that kind of thing.

449
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:08,965
你对警方提到他了吗?
And did you tell the police about him?

450
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:16,848
当然没有 一诺千金
Of course not, a promise is a promise.

451
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:19,559
是的 当然
Yes, of course.

452
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:22,395
非常感谢 莫里森小姐
Thank you, Miss Morrison.

453
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:59,784
那就是闯入者的四足小伙伴
That is our intruder's four-footed companion.

454
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:02,120
是只猫鼬
It's a mongoose.

455
00:31:02,203 --> 00:31:06,332
我想我们找到正主了
I think we've found our man.

456
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,428
我想您就是在印度服役过的亨利・ 伍德先生
Mr. Henry Wood, I believe, late of India.

457
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:19,929
能和您谈谈吗?
May I have a word?

458
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:21,139
谈什么?
What about?

459
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:26,144
关于詹姆斯・巴克利上校被杀一事
A little matter of Colonel James Barclay's death.

460
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,110
她是无辜的 这点你得相信我
She's innocent, you can take my word for it.

461
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:02,612
那么你是有罪的
Then you are guilty.

462
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:06,574
不 我没罪
No, I am not guilty.

463
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:10,203
那么是谁击倒上校的?
Then who struck the Colonel down?

464
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:12,872
是上天杀了他
It was a just Providence that killed him,

465
00:32:12,955 --> 00:32:15,917
他自己不堪良心重负
his own guilty conscience.

466
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,586
我想你最好解释清楚
I think you'd better explain.

467
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:21,839
天啊 如果是我打碎他的脑壳
My God, if I had smashed his head in,

468
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:23,257
像我企盼已久的那样
as it was in my heart to do,

469
00:32:23,383 --> 00:32:29,055
那也是他欠我的
he would have got only what he deserved from me.

470
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:33,935
不 我没碰过他一根手指头
No, I never laid a hand on him,

471
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:40,191
根本不劳我动手
I was spared the trouble.

472
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:44,696
让我讲讲我的故事
I'll tell you my story.

473
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:54,122
我对此丝毫不感到耻辱
There is no cause for me to be ashamed of it.

474
00:32:56,205 --> 00:33:02,672
你们看到现在的我 背驼得像骆驼
You see me now with my back like a camel,

475
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:06,509
肋骨也七扭八歪
my ribs all awry,

476
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:09,804
但从前的亨利・伍德下士
but there was a time when Corporal Henry Wood

477
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:14,934
可是麦洛斯团最潇洒的人
was the smartest man in the Royal Mallows.

478
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:19,522
你和巴克利上校同属一个团?
You were in the same regiment as Colonel Barclay?

479
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:28,364
哦 是的 但那是他还是吉姆・巴克利中士
Oh, yes, but he was Sergeant Jim Barclay then.

480
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:31,909
我们同属一个连
We were in the same company,

481
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:38,333
我们还有另一个相同点
and we had something else in common,

482
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,127
都深深爱着
we were both in love

483
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:47,175
同一个女人 南希・迪威艾
with the same woman, Nancy Devoy.

484
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,551
她父亲是
Who was the daughter

485
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:53,431
团部军士长
of the Regimental Sergeant Major.

486
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:59,479
两个男人深爱着她
There were two men who loved her,

487
00:33:59,562 --> 00:34:09,489
但她只爱其中的一个
but only one whom she loved.

488
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:19,874
她...你们一定觉得可笑吧
She you'll laugh when you look at

489
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:25,213
这炉火前蜷缩的可怜虫
this poor thing huddled in front of the fire

490
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:34,889
敢自称是我英俊的外表
and hear me say that it was for my good looks

491
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:42,689
赢得了南希的爱
that Nancy loved me.

492
00:34:55,785 --> 00:35:00,123
她一直以来爱的是我
I was the one she loved all along.

493
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:02,083
但尽管我占据了她的心
But although I had her heart,

494
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:09,424
她父亲却不赞成
her father didn't approve of me.

495
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:13,094
我虽然是个不拘小节 有些鲁莽的人
I was a harum-scarum, reckless sort of lad,

496
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:18,975
但我同时也是忠心耿耿 非常坦率
but I was always honest and plain dealing as well.

497
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:25,857
哦 南希的父亲希望她嫁给巴克利
Oh, Nancy's father wanted her to marry Barclay.

498
00:35:25,982 --> 00:35:28,109
他谨言慎行
He was careful to keep out of trouble,

499
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:33,698
总是见机行事
always did the right thing,

500
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:35,825
不像我这样 常带南希
not like me who took Nancy

501
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:39,287
去他父亲不喜欢的地方
to places her father didn't like.

502
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:42,582
此外 巴克利受过教育
Besides, Barclay had had an education,

503
00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:45,293
就快要升为军官了
he was already marked for the sword-belt.

504
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,503
迪威艾自然觉得巴克利
RSM Devoy naturally thought Barclay

505
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:55,345
和他女儿才是门当户对
the better match for his daughter.

506
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,681
但她对我真心实意
But she remained true to me,

507
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:00,141
我们本来要结婚了
and we would have married

508
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,602
如果不是那场暴动的话
had it not been for the Mutiny.

509
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:07,523
为什么南希・迪威艾没嫁给所爱之人?
Why did Nancy Devoy not marry the man she loved?

510
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:11,444
那是1857的雨季
It was monsoon time in 1857,

511
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:15,323
当印度土兵对英国宣战之时
when the Sepoys rose up against the British.

512
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:20,078
我们团在伯第被狙击
The regiment was shut up in Bhurtee.

513
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:22,664
一万多叛军把我们团团围住
There were 10,000 rebels round us,

514
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:26,793
密不透风 铁桶一般
pinning us down like terriers round a rat cage.

515
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:29,379
我们渐渐弹尽粮绝
We'd run short of food and ammunition,

516
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:31,798
必须联系上尼尔将军正向
we had to communicate with General Neill's column

517
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:34,634
内地进军的纵队
that was moving up-country.

518
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:37,595
这是唯一的获救方法
It was our only chance to get help.

519
00:36:43,226 --> 00:36:45,561
我们连的司令官希望有志愿者
Our company commander had asked for a volunteer,

520
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:48,481
一个机灵强壮的战士潜出营地
a fit, strong soldier to slip out of the garrison

521
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:50,400
趁着夜色通风报信
at dead of night and make contact

522
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:53,486
找到平原上的救援纵队
with the relief column out on the plain beyond.

523
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:56,990
像傻子一样 我主动请缨
Like a fool, I volunteered.

524
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:59,158
那是个危险重重的任务
It was a dangerous mission all right,

525
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:02,870
千百条生命处于危险之中
there were a 1,000 lives in peril.

526
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:06,290
但我只牵挂其中的一个...
But I was thinking of only one of them...

527
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:21,389
南希・迪威艾
Nancy Devoy,

528
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,558
我深爱的女人 世上最美丽
the woman I loved, and the finest girl

529
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:27,603
最生机勃勃的女人
that ever had the breath of life between her lips.

530
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:35,570
和她道别是最难的一环
Saying goodbye to her was the hardest thing.

531
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:39,741
我们交换了定情信物 没想到
As we exchanged mementos, I never thought that

532
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,869
这一别就是30年
I was saying goodbye to her for 30 years.

533
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,166
是我追求南希的情敌
It was my rival for Nancy's hand

534
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,876
送我上的路
who saw me off on my journey

535
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,878
深夜穿越敌军封锁线
through the enemy lines that night,

536
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:54,047
巴克利中士
Sergeant Barclay.

537
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,631
他说他对驻地
He said he knew the lie of the land

538
00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:57,717
周边地形再清楚不过
around the garrison better than any other.

539
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,053
当我志愿寻找救援的时候
While I volunteered to make the journey,

540
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:02,347
吉姆・巴克利自愿指引我
Jim Barclay volunteered to advise me

541
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:06,768
最佳行动路径
on the best route to take.

542
00:38:12,774 --> 00:38:14,609
那之后
So, just after then,

543
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,320
在战友的炮火掩护下
while my comrades gave me covering fire,

544
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:20,907
我出发了
I set off.

545
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:26,496
巴克利告诉我沿着溪流
Barclay had told me to follow a stream

546
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:28,122
向一个小峡谷走
which would lead to a gully.

547
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:31,709
他说 这是最安全的下山途径
This, he said, was the safest way downhill.

548
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:33,294
他的指引很有用
His directions were perfect

549
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,213
我很快就涉过刺骨的河水
and soon I was wading through icy water

550
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:40,301
那里昨天还是喜马拉雅山脉的积雪
that only the day before had been snow in the Himalayas.

551
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,978
我能看到叛军的营帐和灯火
I could see the lights and fires in the rebels' camp

552
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,605
但我隐藏得很好
but I kept well down,

553
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:54,982
躲过了哨兵的视线
out of sight of their sentry posts.

554
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:57,819
我到了小峡谷后 自认为安全了
I came to the gully and thought I was safe.

555
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:07,161
紧接着 我被袭击了
Then it happened, I was attacked.

556
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:09,580
重物击中了我的头部
Something hard cracked down on my head

557
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:15,420
之后就不省人事了
and everything spun around.

558
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:19,465
当我醒来之后 我被绑得像只鸡一样
When I came to, I was trussed up like a chicken

559
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:21,801
还被挂在树上
and hanging from a tree.

560
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:24,178
我的手臂像是生生从
My arms felt as though they were being wrenched

561
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,931
关节处扯了开来
out of their sockets.

562
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:30,268
我不在乎疼痛 我最痛心的
I didn't mind the pain, but I was sick at heart

563
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:33,146
是没能完成任务
for having failed in my mission.

564
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:35,314
那些等待救助的人
What would be the fate of those

565
00:39:35,398 --> 00:39:38,026
他们的命运会如何呢?
I had been trying to save?

566
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,038
但最大的震惊是 从我能听懂的
But the biggest blow came as I listened

567
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:54,083
叛军口中说出的一些字眼
to what I could understand of a rebels' talk.

568
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:57,879
我发现自己被出卖了
I heard enough to realize that I had been betrayed.

569
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,048
指引我方向的那个人
The very man who had shown me the way to take

570
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:02,467
居然把我出卖给敌人
had betrayed me to the enemy.

571
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:04,635
巴克利不惜除掉我
Barclay had got rid of me

572
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:07,221
只为得到我的女孩
to make sure he could have my girl.

573
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:22,153
现在 你们知道了詹姆斯・巴克利的心狠手辣
Now, you know what James Barclay was capable of.

574
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:26,783
原来尼尔将军的纵队
Well, it turned out that General Neill's column

575
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:30,370
已经在救援伯第的路上了
was already on its way to relieve Bhurtee.

576
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:32,872
叛军撤退了
The rebels retreated,

577
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:36,209
他们带走了我
they dragged me away with them.

578
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:38,419
百般折磨我
I was tortured.

579
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:45,134
我试图逃跑 又被抓住折磨
I tried to escape, I was tortured again.

580
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:48,096
又隔了多少年啊
It was to be many a long year

581
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,015
我才再次看到一张白人的脸
before I saw another white face.

582
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,982
俘虏我的人逃向北方 进入了深山
My captors fled north, further into the hills,

583
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:03,194
把我当做奴隶
and used me as a sort of slave.

584
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:04,904
我过着猪狗不如的生活
I was treated worse than a dog

585
00:41:04,988 --> 00:41:09,534
这些混蛋几乎折断了我每一根骨头
and they damn near broke every bone in my body.

586
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:13,371
有时我更希望他们杀了我
Sometimes I'd wish they'd just killed me,

587
00:41:13,496 --> 00:41:15,623
但我对那个毁我一生的人的厌恶
but my thoughts of hatred and loathing for the man

588
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,459
和仇恨支撑着我
who destroyed my life kept me going.

589
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:22,630
我每天都想着报复巴克利
I dreamed of revenge on Barclay.

590
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:39,272
一天 阿富汗部落的人
One day some Afghan tribesmen

591
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:42,275
杀死了看守我的叛军
murdered the rebels that held me prisoner.

592
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:44,360
把我留在那儿自生自灭
They left me for dead, too.

593
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:47,447
但奇迹发生了 我依旧活着
But by a miracle, I still lived.

594
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:59,000
于是 我像对向那些对我施暴的人复仇
So, I had my revenge on my torturers,

595
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:02,545
但巴克利早就不知去向
but Barclay was beyond my grasp.

596
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,589
至于南希
And what of Nancy,

597
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:07,008
我不知她是生是死
I had no means of knowing whether she was alive or dead.

598
00:42:12,055 --> 00:42:14,349
我流浪回到旁遮普(印度)
I wandered back to the Punjab,

599
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:16,642
住在土人中间
and lived among the natives,

600
00:42:16,726 --> 00:42:19,228
靠耍些把戏为生
picking up a living by the conjuring tricks

601
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:21,981
我跟随街头魔术师学了不少
I'd learned from the street magicians.

602
00:42:22,065 --> 00:42:24,942
何必奢望呢 我一个瘸子
What use was it for me, a wretched cripple,

603
00:42:25,068 --> 00:42:28,029
就算乘船回到英格兰
to get passage back by ship to England

604
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:32,408
和团里的老战友重聚 又有什么用?
and make myself known to my old comrades in the regiment?

605
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:38,039
向吉姆・巴克利复仇的怒焰也没能让我这么做
Even revenge on Jim Barclay didn't make me go.

606
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:42,210
不 我...直说吧
No, I I'll tell you straight,

607
00:42:42,335 --> 00:42:44,921
我更希望我的南希和麦洛斯团的
I preferred my Nancy and my old pals

608
00:42:45,046 --> 00:42:48,216
老战友们继续相信
in the Royal Mallows to go on believing

609
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:51,427
亨利・伍德已经英勇牺牲
that Harry Wood died a hero's death

610
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:53,680
直着腰杆而死
with a straight back,

611
00:42:53,763 --> 00:42:57,183
不愿让他们看我屈膝弓背
than see him crawling about the world

612
00:42:57,266 --> 00:43:04,857
像猩猩一样爬行 不成人形
more like a chimpanzee than a human being.

613
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:06,901
但你还是回来了
But you did return,

614
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:10,530
回到你团部驻扎的奥尔德肖特 为什么?
and to Aldershot where your old regiment was stationed, why?

615
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:15,243
我只想在死前再看看故乡
I just wanted to see the old country once more before I died.

616
00:43:15,368 --> 00:43:24,502
我省吃俭用 终于坐船出发了
I saved what I could and eventually I got a ship.

617
00:43:24,627 --> 00:43:33,886
我不知道团部仍驻扎在奥尔德肖特
I didn't know the regiment was stationed here in Aldershot,

618
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,639
我只想回到战士们的驻地
I just wanted to be where there were soldiers.

619
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:39,100
我可以到各处的餐厅讨生活
I could earn my keep going around the canteens

620
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:43,855
变戏法逗他们乐
doing my tricks to entertain them.

621
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,608
我不再想杀了巴克利
I no longer wanted to kill Barclay,

622
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:49,610
复仇之火
the fires of revenge

623
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:56,117
在时间的历练下已所剩无几
had burned low over the years...

624
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:04,083
直到我见到她
until I saw her.

625
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:15,678
我觉得我应该更英国化些
I thought I'd better get some English tongs,

626
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:17,972
我已经很滑稽了
I looked comical enough without wearing

627
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:20,892
不能再穿这些异国的衣服
these foreign clothes the whole time.

628
00:44:21,017 --> 00:44:23,353
起先 我专心致志挑一件
At first, I was more interested in finding

629
00:44:23,478 --> 00:44:25,813
厚点的外套 不大在乎
a thick overcoat than looking at the charity

630
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:28,858
分发物品的慈善女士们
ladies who were doling them out.

631
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:33,696
之后她们中的一个走过来
Then one of them came over,

632
00:44:33,821 --> 00:44:38,284
我立刻认出了她
I recognized her at once,

633
00:44:38,368 --> 00:44:44,540
她几乎没变 还是那么漂亮
she'd hardly changed, still beautiful.

634
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,627
更令我惊奇的是她...
What's more amazing is she -

635
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,464
她好像认识我
she seemed to know me.

636
00:44:51,547 --> 00:44:53,341
晚上好 我能帮助你吗?
Good evening, can I help you?

637
00:44:53,466 --> 00:45:02,016
你找到需要的...
Have you been able to find anything that -

638
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,186
很抱歉 我以为...
I'm sorry, I thought I...

639
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:11,442
南希 是我啊 亨利
Nancy, it is me, Harry.

640
00:45:11,567 --> 00:45:15,196
别被我吓到
Don't be afraid.

641
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:20,743
我以为你死了30年了
I thought you had been dead these 30 years.

642
00:45:20,827 --> 00:45:23,329
我的确死过了...
I have been...

643
00:45:23,413 --> 00:45:33,256
我以为我再也见不到你了
I thought I would never see you again.

644
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:42,348
我们聊了一会
We spoke for a moment or two together.

645
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:47,353
我告诉她一些我的事
I told her some of my story.

646
00:45:47,437 --> 00:45:48,938
我不该告诉她
I should have spared telling her

647
00:45:49,063 --> 00:45:50,398
她的丈夫是个叛徒
that her husband was a traitor

648
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,568
但我冲昏了头 脱口而出
but it all came pouring out of me,

649
00:45:53,651 --> 00:46:00,408
30年入骨的恨啊
30 years of hate.

650
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:05,079
她被我的话震惊了
She was so effected by what I said,

651
00:46:05,204 --> 00:46:08,207
我无法忍受下去
I couldn't stand it.

652
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:12,462
就逃了出去
I went outside,

653
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:15,923
之后我看到她走出工作厅
then I saw her come out of the mission

654
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,843
于是我便跟踪到她家
and I followed her home.

655
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:25,641
我见她走进那所房子 一盏灯亮了
I saw her go into the house, a light came on.

656
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:34,150
我看着她坐在椅子上
I saw her sitting in a chair.

657
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:38,446
之后他走进那间房间
And then he came into the room.

658
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:41,824
詹姆斯 我得跟你谈谈
James, I have to talk to you.

659
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:43,576
你干嘛锁门
Why are you locking that door.

660
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,994
我说过 别太晚回来
Don't be back late, I said,

661
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,079
别太晚回来 听见没?
don't be back late, didn't I?

662
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,664
你外面有男人
You've been with someone.

663
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:48,581
不...
No -

664
00:46:48,665 --> 00:46:49,707
你背着我找男人
You have been with someone.

665
00:46:49,832 --> 00:46:51,167
没有...
No -

666
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:53,294
到底是谁?
Who is it?

667
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:58,216
你毁了我的一生
...you've ruined my life.

668
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:03,221
这么多年 这么多年来
All these years, all these years.

669
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:06,307
哦 你怎能做出这么...
Oh, how could you do such a thing -

670
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:07,934
巴克利夫人 您的茶
Mrs. Barclay, your tea.

671
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:09,185
这么残忍的事
it was evil.

672
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:12,313
我恨你 我恨你 我恨你 我恨你
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.

673
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:14,148
不
No-

674
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:16,401
看到他抓住她的手
To see him lay a hand on her

675
00:47:16,526 --> 00:47:18,319
我愤怒到了极点
made me mad with anger.

676
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:19,821
我的情感战胜了一切
My feelings overcame me -

677
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:20,989
大卫
David -

678
00:47:21,114 --> 00:47:21,990
您的茶 夫人
Your tea, madam.

679
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:23,658
大卫 你背叛了他
David, you betrayed him.

680
00:47:23,783 --> 00:47:25,159
这不是真的
It's not true.

681
00:47:25,284 --> 00:47:28,663
但他还活着 我告诉你 我见到他了
But he's alive, I tell you, I've seen him.

682
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,791
你说谎 你疯了
You're lying, you're mad.

683
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:48,057
我从未见过一个人有那种表情
He looked as I have never seen a man look.

684
00:47:48,182 --> 00:47:53,146
我清楚的感受到他脸上死亡的气息
I read death on his face as plain as anything.

685
00:47:53,229 --> 00:47:55,732
我的突然出现像一颗子弹
The bare sight of me was like a bullet

686
00:47:55,815 --> 00:48:02,322
打穿了他负罪的心
through his guilty heart.

687
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:07,243
巴克利夫人 巴克利夫人 快开门
Mrs. Barclay, Mrs. Barclay, open the door.

688
00:48:07,368 --> 00:48:09,787
他撞上了壁炉架
He smashed onto the fender.

689
00:48:09,912 --> 00:48:13,708
他在倒下去之前就死了
He was dead before he fell.

690
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:35,521
巴克利夫人 巴克利夫人 快开门
Mrs. Barclay, Mrs. Barclay, open the door.

691
00:48:45,531 --> 00:48:47,825
我从南希手中拿走了钥匙
I took the key to the door from Nancy's hand,

692
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,952
本想开门求救
intending to open it and get help.

693
00:48:50,078 --> 00:48:51,621
转念一想我得快点逃走
I thought I'd better get away

694
00:48:51,746 --> 00:48:53,706
不然就再也洗不清了
or things might look black against me.

695
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:56,376
匆忙中 我一边把钥匙揣进口袋里
In haste, I thrust the key into my pocket

696
00:48:56,459 --> 00:48:57,794
一边抓回逃出笼子
whilst I was chasing Teddy,

697
00:48:57,919 --> 00:49:00,088
爬上床帘的泰迪
who'd escaped from his box and run up a curtain.

698
00:49:00,213 --> 00:49:04,217
泰迪
Teddy.

699
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,347
所以 上校是死于
So, the Colonel died before

700
00:49:09,472 --> 00:49:12,266
撞到壁炉架之前?
he struck his head on the fender?

701
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:16,145
因为突然的震惊 导致中风猝死
An apoplectic fit, brought on by shock.

702
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,273
伍德先生 假设法医也
Mr. Wood, provided the coroner reaches

703
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:22,068
得到相同的结论 那么巴克利夫人
the same conclusion, Mrs. Barclay -

704
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:26,990
南希
Nancy.

705
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:30,827
就会被释放
will be free.

706
00:49:30,952 --> 00:49:32,453
我相信您也不会反对把
I trust you would have no objection

707
00:49:32,578 --> 00:49:34,455
整件事复述给警方吧
to repeating your story to the police,

708
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:39,460
一旦需要的话?
should the need arise?

709
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:45,341
福尔摩斯先生 南希现在如何?
Mr. Holmes, how is Nancy?

710
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:47,677
她人在医院
She's in hospital.

711
00:49:47,802 --> 00:49:51,431
据我所知 她一定会恢复健康
I understand in time she should make a complete recovery.

712
00:49:51,514 --> 00:49:54,225
谢天谢地
Thank God.

713
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:25,882
嗨 安 真高兴见到你
Hello, Ann, how lovely to see you.

714
00:50:26,007 --> 00:50:27,258
你好点了吗?
Are you better?

715
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:28,343
是的 我好多了
Yes, I'm much better.

716
00:50:34,557 --> 00:50:37,310
福尔摩斯 只有一件事我还不明白
Holmes, there's just one thing I don't understand.

717
00:50:37,393 --> 00:50:40,521
如果上校的名字是詹姆斯
If the Colonel's name was James,

718
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:43,608
而伍德被称呼为亨利或哈利
and Wood was called either Henry or Harry,

719
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:46,527
那大卫又是谁?
then who the deuce was David?

720
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:47,945
我亲爱的华生
My dear Watson,

721
00:50:48,071 --> 00:50:50,031
大卫这个名字本应告诉我
that name David should have told me

722
00:50:50,156 --> 00:50:52,533
整个故事 如果我真是你喜欢描述的
the whole story had I been the ideal reasoner,

723
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,744
推理大师的话
which you are so fond of depicting.

724
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:57,413
可是 唉 我没能推断到
But alas, my powers of deduction failed.

725
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:59,624
你瞧 大卫 在这里
You see, David, in this case,

726
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:02,960
是一种谴责之辞
was evidently used as a term of reproach.

727
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:05,672
谴责?
Reproach?

728
00:51:05,755 --> 00:51:07,548
你不记得大卫王怎样
Don't you remember how King David

729
00:51:07,674 --> 00:51:10,385
把赫梯族的乌利亚送到战场
sent Uriah the Hittite into the forefront

730
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:12,553
最前线送死 以便有机会
of the battle to die so that he might

731
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:15,181
夺取他的女人 拔示巴了吗?
steal his woman, Bathsheba?

732
00:51:15,264 --> 00:51:17,975
我想这个故事
I think you will find the story

733
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:21,980
你会在撒母耳记上篇或下篇中找到
in the first or second book of Samuel.

734
00:51:22,105 --> 00:51:24,649
我对旧约记不太清了
My old testament is a little rusty.

735
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:36,828
说的不错 福尔摩斯
You're quite right, Holmes,

736
00:51:36,953 --> 00:51:42,125
撒母耳记下篇 11:14-17
Il Samuel, 11:14-17.

737
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,670
你显然已经查过了
You appear to have looked it up yourself

738
00:51:45,795 --> 00:51:50,800
就在我们从奥尔德肖特回来之后
since we returned home from Aldershot.

739
00:51:50,925 --> 00:51:55,930
你是怎么知道的?
How did you know?

740
00:51:56,055 --> 00:51:58,141
你把这张我们在滑铁卢餐厅
You used this bill for our meal

741
00:51:58,266 --> 00:52:00,476
的账单当作书签 不是吗?
at Waterloo as a bookmarker, did you not?

742
00:52:00,601 --> 00:52:03,896
漂亮 华生
Excellent, Watson.

743
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,403
雕虫小技 我亲爱的福尔摩斯
Elementary, my dear Holmes.

744
00:52:10,486 --> 00:52:15,908
晚安 老伙计
Goodnight, old fellow.

745
