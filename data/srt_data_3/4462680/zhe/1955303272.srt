- Nothing more. - ‭How so?

如果強迫他們公開這部分信息
and by forcing them to reveal this information,

148
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,524

or other mental deficiencies --

152
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:36,324
你是說他們沒有行為能力嗎
you're saying they're incompetent?

153
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:37,694
我是說為了集體訴訟確認
I'm saying we have the right to any record

00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,454
我們有權獲得證明原告
that would speak to their competency,

如果我方委托人患有癡呆
If our clients ‭are suffering from dementia,

那么他們最初和磯鷂渡簽署住宿合同時
then the residency contracts they signed with Sandpiper

00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:48,434
就不可能是知情的
couldn't have been entered into knowingly.

不不  我們不是這個意思
No, no. That is not what we're...

161
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,124
被告想聲稱
The defense wants to claim

162
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:53,724
居住者有能力簽署合同
that their residents are competent enough to be held to their contracts

163
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,794
卻沒有能力起訴
but too incompetent to sue.

164
00:13:56,184 --> 00:13:57,024
這不是很矛盾嗎
So which is it?

165
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:59,734
許多居住者是很多年前簽署合同的
Many of the residents signed their contracts years ago,

166
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:02,114
那時候他們完全有行為能力
and at the time, ‭they were perfectly competent.

Or maybe sandpiper preyed on mentally incompetent seniors

00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:30,274
會讓我們的委托人二次受害
allows our clients to be doubly victimized.

180
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:32,874
我請求拒絕被告的動議  法官大人
I ask that you deny the defense's motion, your honor.

181
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:35,624
我傾向于允許這一申請
I'm leaning toward granting the motion,

182
00:14:35,684 --> 00:14:38,064
但我想重讀一下訴狀和簡述
but I would like to review the pleadings and briefs again.

183
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:40,394
我會很快答復你們
I'll have my decision for you shortly.

184
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:41,804
休庭
Adjourned.

185
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:50,204
回辦公室再見
I'm gonna meet you back at the office.

186
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:01,384
韋克斯勒小姐  你好
Ms. Wexler. Hey.

187
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,564
我只想說  你剛才表現很好
I just wanted to say, good work in there.

188
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:07,134
謝謝  但我肯定輸了
Thanks, but I -- I'm pretty sure I lost.

189
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:09,294
當然了  這種情況你贏不了的
Oh, of course you did. It's an unwinnable position.

190
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:11,294
所以你上司都懶得出面
That's why your boss didn't bother showing up.

191
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,004
但是你堅持不懈  雖敗猶榮  我很欣賞
But you went down swinging, and I admire that.

192
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:15,804
謝謝
Thank you.

193
00:15:16,324 --> 00:15:17,564
你午餐有什么安排
What are you doing for lunch?

194
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,894
可能就在自動販賣機買點吧
Um, probably just grabbing something from the vending machines.

195
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:24,224
我們可以吃好一點嘛
We can do better than that.

196
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,164
斯韋卡特先生  很高興見到你
Mr. Schweikart, good to see you, sir.

197
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:29,874
-你好嗎  肖恩  -我很好
- Ah, how you doing, Sean? ‭- Very well.

198
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:32,704
要什么喝的  您還是要莫斯科之騾嗎
Can I get some drinks for you two? Your usual Moscow Mule?

199
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,684
肯定的  你要嗎
Absolutely. You want one?

200
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:36,484
全市最好的莫斯科之騾
Best Moscow Mule in the city.

201
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:41,094
新鮮的生姜  純銅杯  很正宗
Fresh ginger, ‭real copper mug, the works.

202
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:44,274
真是復古  我不用了
That's very vintage, but I'm good.

203
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,404
冰茶就可以了
Just an iced tea.

204
00:15:45,724 --> 00:15:46,504
你確定嗎
You sure?

205
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:48,944
那好吧  我就獨自做一個
All right, then. I'll be the sole degenerate

206
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,764
工作日中午喝酒的墮落漢吧
who's drinking ‭in the middle of a work day.

207
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,904
那也是復古了
That, too, is vintage.

208
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,164
我去讓他們調
I'll get those started.

209
00:15:56,994 --> 00:16:00,064
所以你在哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所十年了
So, you've been with HHM, what -- 10 years?

210
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,344
沒錯  去年八月滿十年
Y-yeah, last August.

211
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:05,854
你是從收發室做起的嗎
And you started in the mail room?

212
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,804
沒錯  我在那干了六年
I did. I was six years there.

213
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:09,824
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?

214
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,834
我問別人的  這地方很小
Oh, I asked around. It's a small town.

215
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:14,544
聽上去你已經盡職盡責了
You know, it sounds like you certainly paid your dues.

216
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:16,604
我運氣很好
I was very fortunate.

217
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:18,864
律所一邊讓我工作  一邊供我讀完法學院
HHM put me through law school while I worked.

218
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,044
他們很會培養人才
That's great that ‭they foster talent like that.

219
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,834
現在你給他們工作  就當還債是吧
And I imagine you're paying it off as part of your deal?

220
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,084
是的  我很樂意
Yeah, happily.

221
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:26,124
好多人都是這樣的安排
It's a pretty standard arrangement.

222
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:28,814
我得說  今天看你在法庭上
I have to say, ‭watching you in court today,

223
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,134
確實勾起我不少回憶
it sure did bring back some old memories for me.

224
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,214
反正讓我想起了一件事
One in particular, anyway.

225
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:34,294
-是嗎  -是的
- Yeah? - ‭Yeah.

226
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,854
我當時從法學院畢業一年  在波士頓一家律所
I was a year out of law school at this firm in Boston,

227
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:39,004
我終于接了第一個大案子
and I was finally put on my first big case --

228
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,824
一樁大型就業歧視案
This huge ‭employment-discrimination suit.

229
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:43,764
這案子讓律所十年都有活干
That thing kept us in billing for a decade.

230
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,624
總之  我們接了這單大的
Anyway, we landed this monster,

231
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:49,194
而且我成為了預審聽證時
and I find out I'm second chair to one of the partners

232
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:50,484
一位合伙人的助理律師
on the preliminary hearing,

233
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:53,334
我就想  "就是它了
and I think, "This is it.

234
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:55,824
"我之后的職業生涯全靠這一搏了"
"This is what will define the rest of my career."

235
00:16:56,324 --> 00:16:58,814
聽證會越來越近
So, the hearing's getting closer and closer,

236
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:00,664
我甚至買了一件負擔不起的西裝
I even get this new suit that I can't afford --

237
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,514
我分三張信用卡刷的
I split it over three credit cards.

238
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,384
可能現在還在還錢
I'm probably still paying it off to this day.

239
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:09,304
我一大早就去了  穿著我的新西裝
So, I go in bright and early, I'm wearing my new suit,

240
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:12,114
準備桌上的材料  這時抗辯方走進來
prepping my table, and in walks the opposing counsel.

241
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,424
他們有四個人  一個高級合伙人
There's four of them -- one senior partner

242
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:17,084
還有三個高級律師
and three high-level associates.

243
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:19,804
我還沒出生他們就干這行了
These guys have been litigating longer than I've been alive.

244
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:23,684
但我想的是  "我很優秀
But I think, "Mm, I'm good.

245
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:25,584
"我老板來了就沒事了"
"I got my boss coming. It'll be fine."

246
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:29,094
我就一個人坐在桌前
So, I'm sitting alone, at my table,

247
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:30,974
等著老板現身
waiting for my boss to show.

248
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:32,874
我等啊等
And I'm waiting.

249
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:34,324
等啊等
And I'm waiting.

250
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,644
突然  他們宣布開庭
And then, suddenly, ‭they're calling us to order,

251
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:39,614
我才意識到我的律所沒人來
and I realize that no one from my firm is coming.

252
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:40,714
只有我一個
It's just me.

253
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,124
我心想  "好吧
So I think, "All right, then.

254
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:44,744
"是時候了"
"This is the moment."

255
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:47,854
我上前拼了老命地辯論
And I get up there, and I argue like my life depended on it.

256
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:51,074
汗流浹背  旁征博引
I'm sweating, and I'm citing statutes left and right.

257
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:53,914
我表現得還行
And I'm doing okay. Respectable.

258
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:57,184
但我這把BB槍難敵四架榴彈炮
But I'm just a BB gun to these four howitzers.

259
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:01,454
我當然輸了
And I lose, of course.

260
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,304
這不可避免
It was inevitable.

261
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:05,834
但之后我突然意識到
But later, it hit me

262
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:08,394
我的老板根本就沒打算到場
that my boss never intended to show.

263
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:11,564
他們都一笑而過
And they all laughed about it.

264
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:14,404
拍著我背說  那是對我的考驗
They patted me on the back, said it was my trial by fire,

265
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:16,174
我也跟他們一起笑  但你知道
and I laughed with them, but, you know,

266
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,574
我覺得很不好受
It never really sat well with me.

267
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,294
你需要他們的支持
You want them to have your back.

268
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:23,784
因為最后我才知道
Because at the end of the day,

269
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:26,054
那不是為了考驗我的勇氣
it wasn't about proving my mettle.

270
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:29,314
而是我老板不想錯過高爾夫
My boss had a tee time that he didn't want to miss.

271
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:32,984
我在那兒沒待多久
I wasn't there long.

272
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:41,114
可以問下你為什么叫我...來這嗎
Could I ask why we... are here?

273
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:45,014
我已經注意你很久了
You know, I've had my eye on you for a while.

274
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,324
自從凱特爾曼一案開始
Since that Kettleman thing.

275
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,544
你真是為他搞定了一樁極好的案子
That was an excellent deal you got for him.

276
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:51,314
我想知道為什么
And I'm wondering why someone

277
00:18:51,314 --> 00:18:53,314
一個可以搞定那一單的人
who could put together a deal like that

278
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:56,934
沒有后援  明知要輸  卻還要辯護
is arguing a losing position with no backup.

279
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,434
我對哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所沒有怨言
I have no complaints about HHM.

280
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,084
很好
That's great.

281
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:07,454
然而  如果你碰巧正在尋求改變
However, if on the off chance, if you're pondering a change,

282
00:19:07,454 --> 00:19:09,264
斯韋卡特考科利會很樂意
Schweikart and Cokely would be more than happy

283
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,994
善用你的才華
to put your talents to good use.

284
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:14,724
當然我們得有更正式的會面
Of course, we'd have to have a more formal meeting,

285
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,954
討論細節  但我們認為你會非常合適
work out specifics, but we think you would be a great fit.

286
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:24,344
我受寵若驚
Well, I'm -- I'm flattered,

287
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,894
但這明顯存在職業道德問題
but there's clearly an ethical issue here.

288
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:28,884
當然是等你弄完磯鷂渡的案子
Well, of course, ‭we'd take you off Sandpiper.

289
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:29,894
你放心
And rest assured,

290
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:32,754
我們不想要哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所的
we wouldn't be expecting any information

291
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,824
任何策略信息
about HHM strategy.

292
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:36,734
我們是一家大規模多元化的律所
Look, we're a large, diversified firm.

293
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:39,994
想想你可以用我們的資源做什么
And just think what you can do with our resources

294
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,574
可以自由地展翅翱翔
and the freedom ‭to really spread your wings.

295
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:47,704
這...
That's...

296
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:52,024
我虧欠哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所很多
I owe a lot to HHM.

297
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:53,864
學費債務嗎  我們可以替你償還
Your tuition debt? ‭We can take care of that.

298
00:19:55,914 --> 00:19:57,114
真慷慨
That's very generous.

299
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:01,044
花點時間去考慮一下
Well, give it some time to think about it.

300
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:02,944
你來電話  我們就安排會面
And you give me a call, and we'll set up a meeting

301
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,644
會見其他高級合伙人
with the rest of the senior partners.

302
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:07,244
先說清楚...
And to be clear...

303
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:09,984
我說的可是合伙人機會
I'm talking partner track.

304
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:13,524
天哪肖恩  你是在莫斯科調的酒嗎
Jesus, Sean, what -- what'd you have to send to Moscow?

305
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:15,684
抱歉讓您久等了  斯韋卡特先生
Sorry for the wait, Mr. Schweikart.

306
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:17,634
可以點餐了嗎
Are we ready to order?

307
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,044
...梅斯向您推薦這款快速切菜機
...Mays here for the gourmet quick chop.

308
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:38,984
它可以十分快捷  簡便  安全地
It's the fastest, easiest, and safest way

309
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,334
將蔬菜切碎或切塊
to chop, mince, or dice any vegetable, guaranteed.

310
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,514
操作方法如下
Here's how it works.

311
00:23:43,514 --> 00:23:45,554
放好蔬菜
Just place the vegetable on the board,

312
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:46,624
按下按鍵
give it tap

313
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:50,094
立刻就有了做沙拉用的細細切碎的卷心菜
and you've got finely shredded cabbage in a second for crunchy coleslaw.

314
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:52,124
再按一下...
tap again and chop...

315
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:00,384
趴下
Get down. ‭

316
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,124
趴下
Get down.

317
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:23,754
要帶什么話
What's the message?

318
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:25,764
收下那五千塊
Take the $5,000.

319
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:28,104
這么一句話需要兩個人來跟我說
It took two guys to tell me that?

320
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:32,464
我們只是來嚇嚇你  僅此而已
We were just supposed to scare you, that's all.

321
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:34,514
那下次更狠一點
You try harder next time.

322
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:36,494
滾出去
Get out.

323
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,114

00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:21,227
明天  你去找地檢官
Tomorrow, ‭you go to the district attorney,

475
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:26,677
向他解釋我侄子的槍是你的
and you explain to him that my nephew's gun was yours.

476
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,037
地檢會問你
The D.A. will ask you,

477
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:31,627
"你為什么之前不說"
"Why you didn't say anything before?"

478
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:35,607
你跟他說你忘了  你嚇壞了...
You tell him you forgot, you were rattled --

479
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:36,737
隨便你編什么理由
Make up anything you want.

480
00:38:36,737 --> 00:38:38,407
我不在乎
I don't give a shit.

481
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:40,147
但這是你的槍
But it's your gun.

482
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:45,597
我們來談談我的報酬吧
Let's discuss my payment.

483
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:47,537
晚了
Mm, that time is past.

484
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:49,387
五千塊飛了
No $5,000 for you.

485
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:51,127
我要五萬
The price is $50,000.

486
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:53,807
報酬是活著出去怎么樣
How about the payment is you get to live?

487
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,017
不夠
Not enough.

488
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:59,207
你覺得你有資格跟我談條件嗎
Oh, you think ‭you can negotiate with me?

489
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,307
只要我一句話
I say the word,

490
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:03,617
我的侄子們就會去汽車旅館
my nephews go to a certain motel,

491
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:05,947
拜訪你的兒媳
pay a visit to your daughter-in-law

492
00:39:05,947 --> 00:39:08,267
和你的小孫女
and your little granddaughter.

493
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,587
你覺得接下來會怎么樣
What do you think happens then?

494
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:15,687
好好考慮考慮你的處境
Consider your position carefully.

495
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:18,057
要么給我錢
I get my money...

496
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:21,477
要么我們倆都別想活著走出這里
or neither of us walk out of here.

497
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:34,057
你為了這個連命都不要了嗎
You willing to die for this?

498
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:40,087
或許我比你更需要那五萬塊吧
Maybe I need the $50,000 more than you do.

499
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:50,727
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}我早說了吧
I told you, right?

500
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:53,637
{\an8}{\pos(192,219.274)}夠膽兒
Giant balls.

501
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:58,047
你說話這么欠是怎么活到現在的
How you manage to live so long with a mouth like that, hmm?

502
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,427
五萬塊
$50,000.

503
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:09,667
槍是你的
And the gun is yours.

504
00:40:48,617 --> 00:40:49,587
他派你來的嗎
He sent you?

505
00:40:49,587 --> 00:40:50,857
我主動要來的
I volunteered.

506
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:53,947
只有這樣說話才安全
Only safe way for us to talk.

507
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:13,957
你剛才在那太得寸進尺了
You really pushed it in there.

508
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,047
我們干的那事
That thing we did...

509
00:41:21,507 --> 00:41:24,177
一旦被他發現  我們倆都必死無疑
...he finds out, we're both dead.

510
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:25,617
這你清楚的吧
You get that, right?

511
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:28,697
我們干什么了
What thing we did?

512
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:35,697
這是干嘛
What's this?

513
00:41:35,697 --> 00:41:37,077
兩萬五
$25,000.

514
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:38,247
為什么要給我
What for?

515
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,157
我們達成了協議
We made a deal.

516
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:42,057
而我搞砸了
I didn't hold up my end.

517
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:47,907
你的麻煩很快就要出來了  比我們預計的更快
Your problem is coming back sooner than we expected.

518
00:41:57,577 --> 00:42:02,397
{\an8}克拉多克海事銀行
大北極公司

519
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:07,277
你要把錢提出來嗎
You gonna cash that?

520
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,077
我認識個人  他或許能幫忙
I might know a guy who can help.

521
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,197
還是把它當成紀念品吧
It's better as a souvenir.

522
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:16,797
我以為你今天早上可能會  我也不知道
I figured you'd be maybe -- I don't know --

523
00:42:17,297 --> 00:42:18,947
稍微開心一點
a touch happier this morning.

524
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:21,267
就算只有那么一點點
Maybe a smidge, possibly?

525
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:23,847
我很開心  非常開心
I am. I'm totally happy.

526
00:42:24,247 --> 00:42:25,347
為什么會不開心
Why wouldn't I be?

527
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:28,887
我
I, uh...

528
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:32,357
我收到了一個工作邀請
I had a job offer.

529
00:42:33,437 --> 00:42:35,747
真的嗎  哪家律所
Really? From where?

530
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:38,407
斯韋卡特考科利
Schweikart and Cokely.

531
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,267
真的假的
Seriously?

532
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,837
里奇·斯韋卡特甚至還說愿意幫我償還
Rich Schweikart said that they would even pay off

533
00:42:41,837 --> 00:42:43,427
法學院的貸款
my law-school loans.

534
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,587
太棒了
That's great.

535
00:42:45,587 --> 00:42:47,877
你向霍華德辭職的時候請叫上我
Please let me be there when you tell Howard.

536
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:49,047
拜托了
Please.

537
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:51,347
那為什么還一臉憂傷
So why the sad puppy eyes?

538
00:42:51,347 --> 00:42:52,847
你不想要那個工作嗎
What, you don't want that job?

539
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:54,497
不不  我當然想要
No, no, o-of course I do.

540
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:55,877
我是說  誰會拒絕這樣的機會  是吧
I mean, who wouldn't, right?

541
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:57,327
這是家大律所
It's a huge firm.

542
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,007
你再也不用在霍華德手下受氣
You get out ‭from under Howard's thumb.

543
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:00,737
是啊  就是
Right. Exactly.

544
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:03,217
而且  反正我在哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
Besides, HHM is looking more and more like

545
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:04,637
越來越沒有前途
a dead end for me, anyway.

546
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,327
就是啊  所以還有什么問題嗎
Exactly. So what's the problem?

547
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:09,817
我只是
I just...

548
00:43:15,477 --> 00:43:16,457
我也不知道
I don't know.

549
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,527
我一直在想你漂在那個池子里的場景
I keep thinking of you floating in that pool.

550
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:26,057
你知道你想要什么  可我成了你的障礙
You knew what you wanted, but I got in the way.

551
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:28,177
你說什么呢
What are you talking about?

552
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:32,517
你進戴維斯梅因律所是為了我
You took the Davis & Main job because of me.

553
00:43:33,187 --> 00:43:35,937
我去那里工作是因為這是正確的選擇
I took that job because it was the right decision.

554
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:38,017
穩定的收入  有了
A steady paycheck -- done.

555
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:42,317
比原來不知道大到哪里去的住處  也有了
A place to live that's more than, oh, 5 square feet -- boom.

556
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:45,317
純色的汽車  到手了
A car that's all one color -- nailed it.

557
00:43:45,627 --> 00:43:46,807
我日子很好過
‭I'm good.

558
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:48,317
我得到了我想要的
I got what I wanted.

559
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:50,177
而你  等你進了那什么斯韋卡特
And you, ‭with the Schweikart thing?

560
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:52,147
你就可以得到你想要的一切
You could have ‭everything you ever wanted.

561
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:54,557
還有什么不滿意的
What's not to love about that?

562
00:43:56,957 --> 00:43:57,857
是啊
Yeah.

563
00:43:58,717 --> 00:43:59,937
還有什么不滿意的
What's not to love?
