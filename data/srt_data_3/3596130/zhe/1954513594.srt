1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,090
《生活大爆炸》前情提要
Previously on The Big Bang Theory.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,840
我们担心你
We were worried about you.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,120
别这么夸张
Don't be melodramatic.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,930
我只是准备登上火车  永远离开
I'm just getting on a train and leaving forever.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,060
生活中有几件事不如你意
So a few things don't go your way

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,110
你就决定
and your best decision

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,600
像个流浪汉般坐火车远走高飞吗
is to ride the rails like a hobo?

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,520
莱纳德  我不知所措
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,670
一切都在改变  
Everything is changing,

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,660
多到让人无法接受
and it's simply too much.

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,610
我需要离开  好好想想
I need to get away and think.

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,540
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,280
什么事
Yes?

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,150
我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

15
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,130
这不废话吗
Of course you are.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,830
慢走不送
You just made that easier.

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,920
45天后

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,390
打扰一下
Excuse me.

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,240
有没有可能
Is it at all possible

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,310
你现在打的是毛线裤呢
that you're knitting a pair of pants?

21
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,650
别走  你感到害怕是可以理解的
Oh, well, no, you're understandably terrified.

22
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,720
但请给我个机会解释
But, you know, allow me to explain.

23
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,040
45天前  我开启了一段
45 days ago, um, I embarked on

24
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,930
心灵疗伤铁路之旅
a railroad journey of healing

25
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,530
因为当时我的大学
because my university

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,040
逼我研究弦理论
was making me do string theory,

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,260
而我最喜爱的漫画店发生了火灾
and my favorite comic book store burned down,

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,310
我的室友还订婚了
and when my roommate got engaged,

29
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,280
而我女朋友想搬进来跟我同居
my girlfriend wanted to move in with me,

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,340
而那明显是幌子  她的目的...
which was no doubt a ploy just to see my--

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,500
抱歉失礼了  是染指我小裤裤里的东西
well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts.

32
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,660
先生  能借用一下电话吗
Uh, sir, may I use your phone?

33
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,650
-恐怕不能  -好吧
- I don't think so. - Yeah, well,

34
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,330
我知道我现在是半裸的
I understand that I'm half naked,

35
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,310
但是我有个合理的解释
but there is a reasonable explanation.

36
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,940
我在火车卧铺上睡觉时
While I slept in my sleeper car,

37
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,890
东西全被偷走了
all my possessions were stolen.

38
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,330
通常来说  我都会穿睡裤
Now, typically, I wear pajamas,

39
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,280
但最近我习惯了流浪汉的生活方式
but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,730
而睡裤是普通人穿来睡觉的
and pajamas are the sleep-pants of the Man.

41
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,920
我告诉你  圣雄甘地也没穿裤子
I'll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,220
全印度还不是团结起来支持他
and a nation rallied behind him!

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,810
老兄
My good man...

44
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,980
在你走之前
Now, before you walk away...

45
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,830
我想说我可能看起来像疯子
I know that I may appear deranged,

46
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,530
但其实我是一个世界闻名的物理学家
but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist.

47
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,600
不信你问我玻色子跟费米子的差异
Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion.

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,160
来啊  你问吧
Go ahead, ask!

49
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,700
玻色子自旋为整数
Bosons have integer spin,

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,870
费米子自旋为半整数
fermions have half-integer spin!

51
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,360
我的腿好冷
My legs are getting cold!

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,550
为什么没人帮帮我呢
Why won't anybody help me?

53
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:21,110

生活大爆炸
第八季第一集

58
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,490
早安
Morning.

59
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,310
想跟我一起做瑜伽吗
Hi. Want to do yoga with me?

60
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,350
让我先喝杯咖啡
Um, let me just have some coffee first,

61
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,810
我才有力气告诉你
and then I'll have the strength to tell you

62
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,880
我超级不想做瑜伽
how much I won't be doing that.

63
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,600
你好
Hello?

64
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,050
莱纳德  是我
Hello, Leonard.

65
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,570
兄弟  很高兴又听到你的声音
Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,030
我在亚利桑那州的金曼
Uh, I'm in Kingman, Arizona,

67
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,090
我要你来接我一趟
and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.

68
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
我很乐意
I'd love to.

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,790
可是我得跟佩妮一起做瑜伽
I'm just about to do yoga with Penny.

70
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,660
莱纳德  我在警局里
Leonard, I'm at the police station.

71
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,750
我被人洗劫一空
I was robbed.

72
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,060
他们拿走了我手机
Th-They took my phone,

73
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,440
我的皮包  我的iPad  全被偷了
my wallet, my iPad, everything.

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,040
天啊  你没事吧
Oh, my God, are you okay?

75
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,410
当然有事
No, I'm not okay.

76
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,650
我穿着借来的裤子
I-I'm wearing borrowed pants,

77
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,520
身上也没证件
I-I don't have I.D.,

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,030
而这里其中一个警察
and one of the officers here

79
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,400
一直叫我小鸡脚
won't stop calling me Chicken Legs.

80
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:28,980
好吧
Okay.

81
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,090
我来接你
Uh, I'll-I'll come get you.

82
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,790
地址呢
What's the address?

83
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,920
怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,450
他的东西全被偷了
He got all of his stuff stolen.

85
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,070
好的
Okay...

86
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,120
快来
Hurry.

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,430
谢尔顿  撑住
Sheldon, hang tight.

88
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,850
你还需要我带什么东西给你吗
Hey, do you want me to bring anything?

89
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,060
拜托你了
Oh, yes, please.

90
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,240
带条裤子
A pair of pants.

91
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,500
我的牙刷
And my toothbrush.

92
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,240
我的信
Yeah, and my mail.

93
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,170
还有帮我想怎么回敬人家笑我小鸡脚
And a really good comeback for chicken legs,

94
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,370
因为我回他"你才是小鸡腿  你们全家都是小鸡腿"
because "I know you are, but what am I?"

95
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,930
他只无语的藐视我
was met with stony silence.

96
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,100
我会尽快过来
I'll be there as soon as I can.

97
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,940
他没事吧
Is he okay?

98
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,940
人是没事  就是有点吓着了吧
Yeah, he's fine, he's just a little rattled.

99
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,750
有兴趣陪我一起开车去亚利桑那吗
Oh... Feel like driving to Arizona with me?

100
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,090
不行  我得去面试呢
I can't, I have that job interview.

101
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,490
对哦  而且
Oh, right. Besides,

102
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,020
我也不想听六个小时的"你的发型变了
I don't need six hours of "Your hair is different.

103
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,390
你为什么换发型了
Why did you change your hair?

104
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,710
我要憋住呼吸到你头发长出来为止"
I'm holding my breath until your hair grows back."

105
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,030
好吧  行
All right, fine.

106
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,510
你能想到我不应该
Hey, can you think of a reason

107
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,020
-邀请艾米跟我一起来的理由吗  -没有
- I shouldn't invite Amy to come with me? - Nope.

108
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,160
靠  你想都没帮忙想
Come on, you didn't even try.

109
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,100
谢谢你来接我
Thanks for the lift.

110
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,450
你的车怎么了
What's wrong with your car?

111
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,530
我把车送去弄掉防晒膜了
I'm having my windows untinted.

112
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,590
为什么
Why?

113
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,560
现在有个辣妹女友
Got a hot girlfriend now.

114
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,490
得秀给嫉妒的潘棵强纯窗
I want the haters to know.

115
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,080
你在瞎说什么啊
What are you talking about?

116
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,990
才没人会鸟你咧
No one's paying attention to you.

117
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,770
嫉妒水的滋味可好  兄弟
How's that Hater-ade taste, bro?

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,540
这不是上班的路啊
Hey, this isn't the way to work.

119
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,680
我想经过我妈家  看看她好不好
I just want to pop in and make sure Ma's okay.

120
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,380
斯图尔特不是在照顾她吗
I thought Stuart was looking after her.

121
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,900
本来是  我妈石膏拆了后  他就搬了
He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out.

122
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,220
老实说  我挺高兴的
And honestly, I'm kind of glad.

123
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,870
他们俩后来有点怪怪的
It was getting a little weird.

124
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,080
怎么怪
How so?

125
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,220
我不会说  他们...
I don't know, they're...

126
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,780
很亲密
chummy.

127
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,720
像我们这样吗
Like us?

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,090
不  跟我们不一样
No, not like us.

129
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,370
是恶心的那种亲密
Creepy chummy,

130
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,110
就像你和你的狗
like you and your dog.

131
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,810
你妈妈亲自用嘴给他喂食吗
She feeds him out of her own mouth?

132
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,460
我是说  他叫我妈黛比
I mean, he calls her Debbie,

133
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,180
我妈叫他图仔
she calls him Stewie

134
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,470
他们整天两个人黏一起傻笑
and they're all giggly around each other.

135
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,900
相信我  任何食物只要一到我妈嘴里
And believe me, when food goes in that mouth,

136
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,130
就只进不出了
it does not come out.

137
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,040
所以你是担心
So are you worried

138
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,760
他要取代你儿子的位置
because he's replacing you as a son

139
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,630
还是担心他会成为你妈妈的情人
or are you worried because he's becoming her lover?

140
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,170
首先没人能取代我儿子的位置
First of all, no one can replace me as a son.

141
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,190
我是我妈的宝贝小汤丸
I'm her little matzo ball.

142
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,030
其次  我妈这么大年纪
And secondly, my mother is well past

143
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,440
早就跟性生活无缘了
having any kind of sex life.

144
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,170
好吧
Okay, okay.

145
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,960
其实有很多老年女性仍过着活力四射的...
Although many older women lead vibrant, active...

146
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,090
我说无缘就是无缘
I said well past it!

147
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,200
请问一下  赫尔南德斯警官
Excuse me, Officer Hernandez?

148
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,350
有任何偷我东西的贼的线索了吗
Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?

149
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,020
还没
Not yet.

150
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,700
或许我可以帮忙
Well, perhaps I can help.

151
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,810
神探福尔摩斯曾说过
Sherlock Holmes always says

152
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,610
排除所有不可能因素
when you eliminate the impossible,

153
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,900
剩下的即使再不合理
whatever remains, however improbable,

154
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,200
必然是事实的真相
must be the truth.

155
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,180
你试过这么做吗
Now, have-have you tried doing that?

156
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,570
没有
Nope.

157
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,380
或许你该试试
Well, maybe you should.

158
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,700
世上有很多叫《神探福尔摩斯》的书
Th-Th-There's lots of books called "Sherlock Holmes"

159
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,710
而却没有一本叫《神警赫尔南德斯》
and there's no books called "Officer Hernandez."

160
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,860
谢谢你来陪我
Thanks again for coming.

161
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,620
我一个人开六个小时的车实在太漫长了
Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.

162
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,930
我的荣幸
My pleasure.

163
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,990
而且我一点也不气
And I'm not angry at all

164
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,340
我男朋友落难时  居然打给你而不是我
that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me.

165
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,970
真是太好了
I love that!

166
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,280
好吧  这六小时一定过得"飞快"
Yeah, time's gonna fly by.

167
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,920
我好几年没去面试了
I haven't been on a job interview in years.

168
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,050
我真的好紧张
I'm really nervous.

169
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,090
别紧张
Don't be.

170
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,970
你天生就是干医药销售这行的
You are built for pharmaceutical sales.

171
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,840
你可爱  轻浮而且...
You're cute, you're flirty and...

172
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,480
本来以为会有三个优点说呢...
Started that like there were gonna be three things.

173
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,940
我没有任何销售经验
I don't have any experience in sales.

174
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,090
除非我在高中时穿着比基尼洗车也算
Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school.

175
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,890
但你叫我把这段从我简历上删掉了
But you already made me take that off my resume?

176
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,210
这份工作其实跟服务生很像
This job is a lot like being a waitress,

177
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,210
只不过你不是给客人推销
except instead of pushing the fish tacos

178
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,460
快变质的鱼肉玉米卷
'cause they're about to go bad,

179
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,060
你是推销我们的抗抑郁药
you're just pushing our antidepressants

180
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,210
在FDA发现这药能引起直肠出血之前赶紧卖掉
[FDA  美国食品及药物管理局]
before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.

181
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,580
是真的吗
They do?

182
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,630
或许吧
Maybe.

183
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,750
但就像我们律师说的  这世界上有很多东西
But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things

184
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,970
能导致直肠出血
that can cause a rectum to bleed.

185
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,380
我在丹面前帮你说了不少好话
Anyway, I talked you up to Dan.

186
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,910
他就是面试你的那个人
He's the guy who'll be interviewing you.

187
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,310
真是太谢谢你了
Oh, I really appreciate this.

188
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,020
我只希望我到时不会手足无措
I just hope I'm not in over my head.

189
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,950
没事的  就跟平时一样表现自己
You'll be fine. Just be yourself.

190
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,590
-我真希望我能多点自信  -佩妮
- I wish I felt more confident. - Penny,

191
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,150
如果我觉得你不能胜任这份工作
I wouldn't have put you up for this job

192
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,390
我就不会推荐你
if I didn't think you could handle it.

193
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,690
谢谢  但或许我该取消面试
Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.

194
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,590
现在取消太晚了  你一定要去
It's too late to cancel. You're going.

195
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,430
但我对医药没有任何了解
But I don't know anything about pharmaceuticals.

196
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,860
我明白了
Oh, I understand.

197
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,500
你想从事你擅长的工作
You want to do something you're already good at.

198
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,280
我懂
I know.

199
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,190
那我何不帮你在
Why don't I get you a job at

200
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,860
"穿着瑜伽裤宅在家工厂"找一份工作呢
the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?

201
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,940
那裤子真的很舒服嘛
They're comfortable.

202
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,430
妈  把衣服穿好  拉杰也在哦
Ma, I hope you're decent. Raj is here!

203
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,780
你最近才开始重新看见女人裸体
You just started seeing naked women again,

204
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,120
我不想让你对咪咪
and I don't want you to be confused

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,900
到底该垂到哪儿感到困惑
about where the boobs should be.

206
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,250
你们好啊
Oh, hey, guys.

207
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,450
你们怎么会来这里
What are you doing here?

208
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,910
那你又怎么在这里
Uh... w-what are you doing here?

209
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,030
我以为你搬出去了
I thought you moved out.

210
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,960
我本来打算搬的
Oh, yeah, I was going to,

211
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,740
但某天晚上  我和黛比
and then Debbie and I got to talking

212
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,060
在吃饭时聊到这事
over dinner the other night.

213
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,590
我没有住的地方
I didn't have anyplace to go,

214
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,030
她也喜欢我待在这里
she likes having me around,

215
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,250
所以我俩异口同声说"那为什么还要搬"
so we both said, "Why leave?" at the same time.

216
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,260
无比珍贵的一段回忆啊
It was precious.

217
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,440
也没那么珍贵吧
It's not that precious.

218
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,980
我本来想支持你的
I'd like to back you up,

219
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,700
但听得起来的确弥足珍贵
but it sounds like it was pretty precious.

220
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,660
图仔  我找不到眼镜了
Stewie, I can't find my glasses!

221
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,180
马上来  小黛黛
Be right there, Deb Deb!

222
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,690
眼镜可能就在她头上
They're probably on her head.

223
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,170
或者在她脖子的肉里  听着
Or in her neck. Listen.

224
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,970
你留在这里住这件事
You staying here seems like something

225
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,030
她应该会跟我说一声啊
she would've talked to me about.

226
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,960
如果你经常给你母亲打电话  你早知道了
Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you'd know.

227
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,770
打电话回家又不会少块肉
It wouldn't kill you to pick up the phone.

228
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,220
我被偷的物品有消息了吗
Any word on my stolen items?

229
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,090
我们在尽一切努力帮你找
We're doing everything we can.

230
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,570
神探福尔摩斯
You know, Sherlock Holmes

231
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,540
喜欢用可卡因来让自己集中注意力
liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus.

232
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,330
但我确定膨化垃圾食品对你也有同样功效
But I'm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.

233
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,110
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

234
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,650
莱纳德
Leonard!

235
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,070
见到你我太高兴了
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

236
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,430
-你没事吧  -没事
- Are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine.

237
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,770
你怎么来了
Why did you come?

238
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,420
你这话什么意思  
What do you mean, why did I come?

239
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,200
你是我的男朋友
You're my boyfriend.

240
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,080
我们超过一个月没有见面了
I haven't seen you in over a month.

241
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,120
我开了六个小时的车过来接你
I just drove six hours to help you out.

242
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,340
你除了说"你怎么来了"
Don't you have anything to say besides,

243
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,350
就没别的话跟我说了吗
"Why did you come?"

244
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,440
有是有  但...
I do, but...

245
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,260
在这么多警察叔叔面前大声说出来
I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud

246
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,680
我觉得不太妥
in front of these police officers.

247
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,680
好
Fine.

248
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,010
悄悄告诉我
Whisper it.

249
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,140
我要坐前排[猎枪]
Shotgun.

250
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,120
谢尔顿  跟我们说说你这段旅程吧
So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip.

251
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,260
你都去了哪儿啊
Where'd you go?

252
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,700
我哪儿都去了
Where didn't I go?

253
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,050
纽约  芝加哥
I went to New York, Chicago,

254
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,330
亚特兰大  丹佛  西雅图
Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.

255
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,570
好玩吗
How were they?

256
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,060
我不知道
Oh, I have no idea.

257
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,570
我从未离开过火车站
I never left the train station.

258
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,660
等等  你跨越了整个美国
Hang on. You traveled across the entire country

259
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,560
却从未离开过火车站吗
and never left a train station?

260
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,950
干嘛要出站
Why would I?

261
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,220
我喜欢的火车都在车站里啊
That's where all the cool trains are.

262
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,780
那你从来没到外面玩过吗
I'm sorry, so you never went outside?

263
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,480
也没吃过一片水果
Or had a single piece of fruit.

264
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,780
所以
So...

265
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,880
你觉得自己为什么
why do you think you'd make

266
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,460
能够胜任医药销售代表的工作呢
a good pharmaceutical sales rep?

267
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,410
我是个善于交际的人
Well, I'm a people person.

268
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,330
人见人爱
People like me.

269
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,370
我喜欢的人里好多都是人
Some of my favorite people are people.

270
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,370
我好像提太多"人"这个字了
I feel like I'm saying "people" a lot.

271
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,830
人  人类  人民  人...好我说完了
People, people, people, pe... Okay, I'm done.

272
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,970
你确定吗
You sure?

273
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,970
人人  说完了
People. Yes.

274
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,070
好吧
Good!

275
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,830
你觉得你上一份工作
So, how do you feel your previous job experience

276
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,840
对这个销售职业有何帮助呢
has prepared you for a career like this?

277
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,960
作为服务员  我的工作很大一部分就是推销
Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job.

278
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,550
相信我  我说服了很多
I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers,

279
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,020
不该吃芝士蛋糕的胖子顾客
who should not be eating cheesecake,

280
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,860
狂吃我们的芝士蛋糕
to have more cheesecake.

281
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,490
而且
I mean,

282
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,100
其中某个胖胖还带着胰岛素泵呢
one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump!

283
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,660
我也有胰岛素泵
I have an insulin pump.

284
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,470
人嘛
People.

285
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,620
感觉很怪吧
It's weird, right?

286
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,990
30多岁的成年人还跟我妈住在一起
A grown man in his 30s living with my mother.

287
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,320
的确很奇怪
That is weird.

288
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,790
我以为他都45岁了
I thought he was, like, 45.

289
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,130
拜托  你难道不觉得这很奇怪吗
Come on, you don't think it's a little odd?

290
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,620
我不知道  她那么孤单
I don't know! I mean, she's lonely.

291
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,080
他又需要地方住
He needs a place to stay.

292
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,070
我想他们之间肯定没什么
I doubt there's any funny business going on.

293
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,670
就算有  那又怎样
And even if there was, who cares?

294
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,710
他们都是成年人了
They're both adults.

295
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,150
"那又怎样"  要是我和你妈睡了
"Who cares"?! You wouldn't care

296
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,240
你也不会觉得怎么样吗
if I slept with your mom?

297
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,040
知道吗  你是我的好基友
You know what? You're my best friend,

298
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,110
我妈婚姻不幸福
and she's in a bad marriage.

299
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,360
我祝福你们
I give you my blessing.

300
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,510
这样做太傻了
This is stupid.

301
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,040
我还是打电话给我妈  告诉她实话
I'm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.

302
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,660
这才是宝贝小汤丸该做的事
'Cause that's what little matzo balls do.

303
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,890
我是黛比
This is Debbie!

304
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,310
我是斯图尔特
And this is Stuart!

305
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,280
开玩笑啦
Just kidding!

306
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,170
给我们留言哦
Leave a message!

307
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,320
该轮到你说话了
This is the part where you talk.

308
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,060
假设有个医生本来开的是
All right, let's say a physician was prescribing

309
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,910
我们竞争对手的药
one of our competitor's drugs.

310
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,570
你要如何说服他转用我们的药呢
How would you convince them to switch to ours?

311
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,130
他有可能需要比基尼女郎帮他洗车吗
Any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini?

312
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,730
不
No...

313
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,320
对不起  浪费了你的时间
Okay, I'm really sorry for wasting your time.

314
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,140
别担心  谢谢你过来面试
Don't worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.

315
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,180
好吧  谢谢
Okay, thanks.

316
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,540
抱歉  你能帮我个忙吗
Um, I'm sor... listen, could you do me a favor

317
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,410
不要告诉伯纳黛特我面试情况有多差
and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview?

318
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,640
她肯定会生气
She'll get upset.

319
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,090
老实说  我真有点怕她
And honestly I'm a... a little terrified of her.

320
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,110
等一下  你害怕伯纳黛特
Wait, wait. You're scared of Bernadette?

321
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,980
有那么一点
Yeah, kind of.

322
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,770
我以为只有我怕她呢
I thought it was just me!

323
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,580
每个人都觉得她特好
E-Everyone thinks she's so nice

324
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,260
说话声音细细的尖尖的
with that squeaky little voice.

325
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,950
我懂  可她其实是个恶霸
I know, but she's kind of a bully!

326
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,510
没有错
She is!

327
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,420
我本来不想见你的
I-I didn't even want to meet you,

328
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,960
可我不敢开口拒绝她
but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.

329
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,740
我也是
Me, too!

330
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,320
对吧  对吧  有一次  我...
Yeah, yeah! One-one time, I had...

331
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,920
我本来要告诉她
Oh! I had to tell her

332
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,510
我们要削减她正在研发的
we were cutting the-the research funding

333
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,210
某种药剂的经费
for one of the drugs she was developing.

334
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,450
结果呢
What happened?

335
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,190
我根本开不了口
I couldn't do it!

336
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,670
她现在还在研究呢
She's still working on it!

337
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,490
这件事你不会说出去吧
We're not gonna tell her about this, right?

338
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,740
-我的天  当然不会  -绝不
- Oh, my God, no! - No, no...

339
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,590
丹佛车站的热狗摊  用的是
At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station--

340
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,880
亨氏番茄酱
Heinz ketchup.

341
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,770
盐湖城车站的热狗摊  用的是
At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station--

342
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,220
亨氏番茄酱
Heinz ketchup.

343
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,710
那印第安纳波利斯车站的热狗摊子  用的是
At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station...

344
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,360
我不在乎
I don't care.

345
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,150
答错了  是汉斯番茄酱
Wrong! Hunt's!

346
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,180
艾米  你觉得如何
Hey, Amy! What do you say?

347
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,490
准备好玩猜芥末酱的游戏了吗
You ready to move on to the mustard round?

348
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,050
你难道没觉察到我这两个小时
Have you not noticed that I've been sitting back here

349
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,330
一直默默地坐在后面吗
quietly stewing for the past two hours?

350
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,340
我以为你只是很不会猜呢
I just thought you were bad at the game.

351
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,310
我是在生你的气
I'm mad at you!

352
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,260
你怎么能就这样
How could you just go away like that

353
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,610
不告而别地走掉
without even saying good-bye,

354
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,360
然后打电话给莱纳德求助  却不来找我
and then call Leonard for help instead of me?

355
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,200
艾米
Amy?

356
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,190
可以让我和我的室友
May I please have a moment of privacy

357
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,570
说几句悄悄话吗
to speak with my roommate?

358
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,310
我们可是在飞驰的车上
We're in a moving car!

359
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,750
你想要我怎么做
What do you expect me to do?

360
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,040
用手指塞住耳朵吗
Stick my fingers in my ears?

361
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,010
我是打算让你像狗一样把头伸出窗外
Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog,

362
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,480
但塞耳朵也行啦
but that'll work.

363
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,290
拜托了  很快就好
Please? This'll be quick.

364
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,260
莱纳德
Leonard?

365
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,190
我们一到家
As soon as we get home,

366
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,900
我就要和艾米发生性关系
I want to have coitus with Amy.

367
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,730
好的  看来她是听不到
Okay, she can't hear.

368
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,170
我之所以打电话给你
The reason I called you

369
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,670
是因为我不想艾米知道
is because I didn't want Amy

370
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,720
我无法在外独立生存
to know I couldn't make it on my own.

371
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,570
这有什么
What's the big deal?

372
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,990
当然这对你来说不算什么
Oh, of course it's no big deal to you.

373
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,430
你视我为偶像  你把我供在神台上
You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me

374
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,700
没什么可以让我从神台上下来
off that pedestal you put me on.

375
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,510
没错
Well, yeah, it's true.

376
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,570
你是我神一般的存在
You-you are a god to me.

377
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,460
我可以听了吗
Can I stop now?

378
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,230
告诉她吧
Just tell her.

379
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,230
我打电话给莱纳德是因为
I called Leonard because...

380
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,360
我失败了
I failed.

381
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,640
我不希望你因此轻视我
And I didn't want you to think less of me.

382
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,220
你是担心这个吗
You were worried about that?

383
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,000
是的
Yes.

384
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,530
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

385
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,810
你并不完美的事实  我是可以接受的
it's okay with me that you're not perfect.

386
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,040
我能再和莱纳德说句悄悄话吗
Can I have one more moment with Leonard?

387
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,120
好的
Sure.

388
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,900
艾米伤了我的心  我要和她分手
Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.

389
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,870
我没想过我会这样说
Now, I never thought I'd say this,

390
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,520
但能见到谢尔顿了  我还有些小激动呢
but I'm kind of excited to see Sheldon.

391
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,460
我没想过我会这样说  但佩妮今天找到工作了
I never thought I'd say this, but Penny got a job today.

392
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,630
是吗
She did?

393
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,240
她成功的唯一原因
Well, the only reason she got it

394
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,000
是因为面试她的人爱慕我
is 'cause the guy who interviewed her loves me.

395
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,440
你想怎样
What do you want?

396
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,930
我大概感觉到
I, uh, kind of got the feeling

397
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,050
你对我住在你妈家有意见
you might not be okay with me staying at your mom's.

398
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,560
你说得对  我有意见
You're right, I'm not.

399
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,010
我觉得很奇怪
I think it's weird.

400
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,640
华仔
Howie?

401
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,650
本来就是  他是个成年男人
It is. He's a grown man.

402
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,760
他就这样不交房租住下去吗
He's just gonna live there rent-free?

403
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,130
这样如何让他有动力
How is that gonna motivate him

404
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,130
不再懒惰  去找工作
to get off his butt and get a job?

405
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,760
你有人生计划吗
I mean, do you even have a plan?

406
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,190
你又不是我爹  你管我
Hey, you're not my father, okay?

407
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,340
而且  你妈和我谈过了
And besides, your mother and I were talking...

408
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,980
"你妈和我"  你又不是我爹
"Your mother and I"? You're not my father!

409
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,690
-我没说我是你爹  -我也没说
- I didn't say I was your father! - Well, I didn't say

410
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,540
-我是你爹  -好啦  冷静
- I was your father! - Okay, calm down.

411
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,280
你不是他爹  他不是你爹
You're not his father, he's not your father!

412
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
谁也不是谁的爹
Nobody's anybody's father.

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,340
你看不惯我的人生选择我很遗憾
I-I'm sorry you don't like my life choices,

414
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,320
但这是我的人生
but it's my life!

415
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,750
住我的房  就得守我的规矩
Well, it's my house, it's my rules!

416
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,060
好吧  爹
Okay, Dad!

417
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,350
如果我修剪了草坪  可以给我零花钱吗
If I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?

418
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,550
不准用这种挖苦的语气和他说话
Hey, don't you take that sarcastic tone with him!

419
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,800
我不用听你教训我
I don't have to listen to you!

420
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,020
别这样跟她说话
Don't talk to her like that!

421
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,700
这是我老妈  老婆
That is my mother... Wife!

422
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,920
老婆  我说的是老婆
My wife! I said my wife!

423
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,150
算了
You know what?

424
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,810
这样谈不会有结果的
This isn't getting us anywhere.

425
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,860
你准备好道歉时  知道在哪里找我
When you're ready to apologize, you know where to find me.

426
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,680
知道  我的家
Well, yeah, in my house!

427
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,050
没错  小婊砸
That's right, sucka!

428
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,680
要是我没去旅行就好了
I wish I'd never gone on that trip.

429
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,250
现在比起离开时  心情一点也没好转
I feel no better now than when I left.

430
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,820
但你还是有所成就的
But you still accomplished something.

431
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,520
是的  如果你告诉任何人
Yeah. If you had told anyone

432
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,570
你打算坐火车周游全国
that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country,

433
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,290
你知道人家会怎么说吗
do you know what they would have said?

434
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,330
-我做不到吗  -太对了
- That I couldn't do it? - Exactly.

435
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,790
不过他们先会欢呼一下
Right after they said, "Yay!"

436
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,860
但你做到了
But you did do it.

437
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,930
事情没有完全如你所愿又如何
So what if it didn't all go your way?

438
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,200
这样才是冒险啊
That's what makes it an adventure.

439
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,300
有道理
That's a good point.

440
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,390
我很像灰袍甘道夫
Yeah, I'm a lot like Gandalf the Grey.

441
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,180
他与炎魔战斗
He fought the Balrog and emerged

442
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,820
成为了更强大的白袍甘道夫
stronger than ever as Gandalf the White.

443
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,440
我的电话和裤子被抢了
I was robbed of my phone and pants,

444
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,780
我回来时变得更强大了
and I, too, came back stronger.

445
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,960
也更白了
And whiter, too,

446
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,590
因为我六周没有晒过太阳了
'cause I wasn't in direct sunlight for six weeks.

447
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,720
你瞧  这次旅行对你有好处
See? This trip was good for you.

448
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,040
的确
Indeed.

449
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,500
我是全世界最聪明的毛毛虫
I was the world's smartest caterpillar.

450
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,040
在咱们国家铁路网上化蛹后
And then after pupating in our nation's railway system,

451
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,650
我破茧而出
I've burst forth

452
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,850
变成了全世界最聪明的蝴蝶
as the world's smartest butterfly.

453
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,610
蝴蝶可以自己从亚利桑那州飞回家
Butterfly could've gotten himself home from Arizona.

454
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,770
我感觉重生了
Yeah, I feel renewed.

455
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,270
我准备好面对未来一切的改变
I'm ready to deal with any changes that come my way.

456
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,560
看谁回来了
Look who's back!

457
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,260
你的发型不同了  你换了发型
Your hair is different. You changed your hair.

458
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,110
我接受无能  我走人了
I can't take this. I'm out.

459
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,660
你们想看看我旅行时的照片吗
Would you like to see pictures from my trip?

460
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,090
你的电话不是被偷了吗
I thought your phone got stolen.

461
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,010
是的  但幸运的是所有照片
Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos

462
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,900
都在云端备份了
got backed up to the Cloud.

463
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,740
原以为守得云开见月明
And you thought they all had a silver lining.

464
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,540
看  第一天
Here-- day one.

465
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,060
这个是我本来要坐的座位
Uh, this was the seat I was going to sit

466
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,980
但我没坐
in but didn't

467
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,700
因为上面有饼干屑
because there were cracker crumbs on it.

468
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,530
因为是一等座  我怀疑是乐之饼干
As it was first class, I suspect Ritz.

469
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,250
这是火车上的厕所
This is the train bathroom.

470
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,280
这是我吃的泻立停
This is the Imodium I took

471
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,380
这样我不必使用火车上的厕所
so I would never have to use the train bathroom.

472
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,900
我真不敢相信你游遍了全国
I cannot believe you traveled the entire country

473
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,590
却从没离开过火车站
and never left the train station.

474
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,610
就是啊
I know.

475
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,940
我差点在得梅因的火灾中丧生
You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines,

476
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,780
但我坚持留在火车上
but I stayed put.

477
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,510
顺便说下
FYI--

478
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,950
当事泻立停的药效过了  我吓屎了
that's when the Imodium gave out.

479
00:20:45,770 --> 00:21:05,770
