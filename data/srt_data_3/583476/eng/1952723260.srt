1
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:07,183
- Are you excited about our honeymoon?
- Yeah, I am.

2
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:13,984
Get it out of your system
while we're alone.

3
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:17,937
- We came to say goodbye.
- Have a great honeymoon.

4
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,866
- Thanks.
- I'll go pack.

5
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:24,346
I already packed.
But I couldn't find your Speedo.

6
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:30,257
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.

7
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:34,786
I'm gonna go pack
my regular, long bathing suit.

8
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:39,619
Good, you're still here!
Have a good honeymoon.

9
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,620
Oh, thank you!

10
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:45,941
And I wanted you guys to know
I am telling the father today.

11
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:51,627
What? What? What?

12
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:56,459
- We know it's Ross.
- How? How do you know?

13
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,337
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

14
00:01:00,588 --> 00:01:03,864
I wanted Ross to know first.
But I'm relieved!

15
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:07,737
- I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
- I know.

16
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:12,658
- Me too!
- I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

17
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:18,024
- You'll all be aunts and uncles.
- But I'm the only one related by blood.

18
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:24,027
Now that you all know, you can give
me advice on how to tell Ross.

19
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:25,707
What'll you say?

20
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:30,026
That I'm having it. And he can be
as involved as he wants.

21
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:31,820
That sounds good.

22
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:36,738
Yeah, but how do I start?
What's the first thing that I say?

23
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:43,019
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Hey, good luck.

24
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,423
Yeah, bye.

25
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:47,061
What was that about?

26
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:51,824
No harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are having a baby.

27
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:57,819
What? I didn't even know!
Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,946
Why am I talking like this?

29
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:05,337
I didn't think
you could keep it a secret.

30
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:08,660
I'm an excellent secret-keeper.
I've kept all our secrets.

31
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,496
- What secrets?
- No, no, Joey.

32
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:16,338
I'm not gonna tell you because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

33
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:21,745
- You'll tell me later?
- You already know.

34
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:25,019
The One Where Rachel Tells Ross

35
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:06,460
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

36
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:10,462
You know, they're married.
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

37
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:16,544
- Maybe you and I should do something.
- All in good time, my love.

38
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:22,179
I left my guitar in their apartment.
You can let me in, right?

39
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,743
They took my key to give to you.

40
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:29,738
- What? They took mine to give to you.
- Why would they take our keys?

41
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:34,339
- Maybe they don't trust us.
- They let me keep my key last time.

42
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:39,542
When you broke the ketchup bottle
and cleaned it with Monica's towels?

43
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:42,182
- I washed those.
- No, you didn't.

44
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,777
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

45
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:49,501
- I really need my guitar.
- I have stuff in there too.

46
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:54,020
- What stuff?
- Monica's chicken parm. I'll fix it.

47
00:03:55,828 --> 00:04:01,937
Mr. Treeger? I need to get into
Monica's apartment. It's an emergency!

48
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:06,744
Gas leak.
Oh, and bring garlic bread.

49
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:12,616
- Did Rachel find you?
- No, why?

50
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:17,737
- She was looking for you.
- I guess I'll catch up with her later.

51
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:23,941
- She really wanted to talk to you now.
- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

52
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,545
- Oh, no.
- What?

53
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:32,345
I think I might know
what this is about.

54
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:35,136
Really?

55
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:41,537
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this...

56
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:45,303
...but a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

57
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:47,865
And?

58
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:56,944
- Wow, I thought you'd be more shocked.
- Oh, sorry. And?!

59
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:04,940
Well, we said we'd just
do it that one time...

60
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:08,737
...but now I think she may
wanna start things up again.

61
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:12,258
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

62
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:17,536
- Why? What else could it be?
- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

63
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,703
I'm telling you,
that's what it is.

64
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:26,537
No wonder she was looking
at me funny at the wedding.

65
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:29,183
She didn't say anything to you?

66
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:32,300
Maybe it's something you ate.

67
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:36,945
- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
- Yeah, I guess I should.

68
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:41,097
You know what I have to realize?

69
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:46,143
I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

70
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:51,944
They always seem to want
a little bit more.

71
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:55,337
I should remember that.

72
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:06,139
Next.

73
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:10,058
- They're kissing, let's go around.
- They're in love.

74
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:13,499
I'm in love too.
But in an orderly fashion.

75
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:19,180
- Next.
- Hi. Can you do that and walk?

76
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:23,660
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

77
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:29,659
Let me see what I can do.
There are some first class seats.

78
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:35,386
They bumped them up to first class!
Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

79
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:37,943
We are on our honeymoon.

80
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:41,817
- Grab my ass.
- Next.

81
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:47,182
Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.
I'm so in love with my new husband.

82
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:50,221
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Congratulations.

83
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:55,337
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

84
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,985
We're on our honeymoon, so can you
bump us up to first class?

85
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:03,698
I'm sorry, that couple
got the last two seats.

86
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:09,426
If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets!

87
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:13,741
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

88
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:18,058
They took my key.
You trust me with yours.

89
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:21,101
Of course, and I'll give it back...

90
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,937
...when they're done
at the key shining place.

91
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:30,256
What the hell is that?

92
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:34,783
- What are you doing?
- You said there was a gas leak.

93
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:39,664
- Why don't you use your key?
- I won't find it before it explodes.

94
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:45,505
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will ask questions.

95
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:50,747
We could have done that.

96
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:56,020
They're going into
the first class lounge.

97
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,344
- You know what's in there?
- No.

98
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:01,022
Me neither. We have to get in!

99
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:06,137
- Just act like you belong.
- Oh, my God! Oranges!

100
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:12,937
- Nice to see you again.
- May I see your tickets, please?

101
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:14,740
Yes, of course.

102
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:18,297
I can't see the seat number.

103
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:22,183
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1A.

104
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:27,782
- This isn't first class, sorry.
- Apology accepted.

105
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:32,539
Sir, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

106
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,660
Fine.

107
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,547
Go, go, go!

108
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:57,385
I think there's something that
we really need to talk about.

109
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:02,748
I think we do.
Why don't we go inside?

110
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:11,585
- Look, I know why you're here.
- You do?

111
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:18,347
Yeah, and to save you from any
embarrassment, I should talk first.

112
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:34,146
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross.

113
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:38,937
It's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

114
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,902
What?

115
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:47,538
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

116
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:52,538
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

117
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:55,219
Seriously, what?

118
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:59,779
Okay, okay. You know what?

119
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:05,142
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

120
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:11,781
I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.

121
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:16,140
- You know what? Can I talk now?
- Oh, sure.

122
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,138
I'm pregnant.

123
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,746
Ross?

124
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:35,746
Ross?

125
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:39,181
Okay, whenever you're ready.

126
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:49,343
And you're the father, by the way.

127
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:04,786
- Can I get you some water?
- I'm good, I'm good.

128
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:11,143
Ross, there is no pressure on you.
You can be as involved as you want.

129
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:20,543
Yeah, I... I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand...

130
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,337
...how this happened.

131
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:29,545
- We used a condom.
- I know.

132
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:34,583
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97% of the time.

133
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,939
What? What?

134
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,744
What?!

135
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:45,216
Well, they should put that on the box!

136
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:51,227
- They do.
- No, they don't!

137
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,701
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

138
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:05,301
- Let's just forget about the condoms.
- Well, I may as well have!

139
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:13,176
- I was really freaked out too when...
- Freaked out? I'm not freaked out.

140
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:17,785
I'm indignant as a consumer!

141
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,697
- You know what? Let's talk later.
- No, I wanna talk now.

142
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:28,461
In fact, I wanna talk to
the president of the condom company.

143
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:31,546
Okay, maybe I should come back...

144
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:34,947
Yeah, I'll press one!

145
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:43,700
- I looked everywhere. No gas leak.
- So now I can heat this up?

146
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:46,378
I'll get moving on that door.

147
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:51,343
Great. Could you not tell
Chandler and Monica about this?

148
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:54,864
They don't have any kids
of their own...

149
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:59,340
...and this door was
like a child to them.

150
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:03,257
I have to put in a new lock.
They'll find out anyway.

151
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:09,023
This looks like an all-day job.
I'll have to cancel my yoga class.

152
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:12,538
Could you tell Jasmine
I can't make it to yoga?

153
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:15,740
- Sure.
- Namaste.

154
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:23,140
- What happened to the door?
- So it's noticeable?

155
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,784
- Is Rachel here?
- Didn't you two already talk?

156
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:29,138
Yeah, but...

157
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:35,139
You guys know Rachel and I slept
together, but there's something else.

158
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:38,107
Rachel's pregnant.

159
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:41,584
- Holy mother of God!
- I can't believe it!

160
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:49,148
- With my child.
- That is brand-new information!

161
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:56,177
- You already know, don't you?
- A little bit.

162
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:59,977
- How you doing?
- Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

163
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:02,543
I didn't handle it well.

164
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:04,784
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

165
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:09,544
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

166
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,626
Then when I turned around,
she was gone.

167
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:18,226
But in my defense, I found out
that condoms are only 97% effective.

168
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,988
- What?
- I gotta go find her.

169
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:27,536
Hold on! Are you serious? So, like,
3% of the time they don't even work?

170
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:32,098
They should put that on the box!

171
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:34,902
- Evidently, they do.
- What?!

172
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:47,023
- I can't believe we're here.
- You've gotta be kidding.

173
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:48,826
What?

174
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,227
As a wedding gift, we're
giving you the Honeymoon Suite.

175
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:57,738
No! You have been screwing us all day!

176
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:01,862
- Who are you?
- We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

177
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:07,182
You got first class, the lounge.
We need free stuff!

178
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:10,340
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

179
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:15,580
You can have the suite.
We don't care where we stay.

180
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:22,347
We're here to celebrate our love.
We just want to be together.

181
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:27,547
We need the stuff.

182
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:33,302
Hey, it's Joey. We smell gas
from your apartment.

183
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:38,377
- Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
- What else is new?

184
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:43,184
- We'd check it, but you took our keys.
- Do something. Get in!

185
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:47,586
- How? I could break down your door.
- Yeah, do that.

186
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:51,741
- You won't blame us for any damage?
- No.

187
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:57,304
- Are you doing it? I can't hear.
- Okay, I'll break it down.

188
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:04,907
He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

189
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:10,543
Okay, we're in.

190
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:18,463
- Rachel, are you comfortable?
- If I said I was, would you judge me?

191
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:22,941
The doctor'll be here in a minute
to do your sonogram.

192
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:30,538
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold
these at Pottery Barn...

193
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,500
We need to talk.

194
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:40,736
Right now? I kind of got an alfresco
situation going on over here.

195
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:44,736
I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier.

196
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:48,543
- Can you stay up near my head?
- Yeah, sorry.

197
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:54,220
I went crazy. I was thinking about me,
and I should've thought of you...

198
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:56,578
- Head, Ross! Head!
- Right.

199
00:16:56,788 --> 00:17:01,100
I want you to know that I'll be
there through this whole thing.

200
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:06,177
Doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes,
baby-proofing the apartment.

201
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:09,778
- We can do that after we get married.
- Married?

202
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,580
We should get married.

203
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:15,542
Because that's your answer
to everything?

204
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,387
No, it's the right thing to do.

205
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:24,946
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But we are not in love, are we?

206
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:30,506
No, but still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

207
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:32,142
Excuse me?

208
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:36,899
Come on, you can't even eat alone
in a restaurant.

209
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:41,545
- What?
- How can you have a baby by yourself?

210
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:45,138
- I can too eat by myself!
- When have you ever?

211
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:49,785
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!

212
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:53,298
Certain others take two hours
to eat soup!

213
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:55,658
Please, you inhale your food.

214
00:17:55,868 --> 00:18:00,339
I grew up with Monica. If you
didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

215
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:04,221
Am I interrupting?

216
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:07,858
No, Dr. Long, come in.
This is Ross, the father.

217
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:11,947
But not the husband,
because she can do this alone.

218
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:16,147
Nice to meet you.
I'll get started on this.

219
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:22,942
- Why can't you admit you need me?
- I need you to stay near my head!

220
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:29,182
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

221
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:32,107
There's your uterus...

222
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:36,187
...and right here is your baby.

223
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,142
Oh, my God.

224
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:45,782
Wow! There it is, I see it.

225
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:49,776
Congratulations.
I'll give you two a minute.

226
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,019
Thank you.

227
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,983
Pretty amazing, huh?

228
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:04,345
I don't see it!

229
00:19:11,228 --> 00:19:15,380
- What? What?
- I can't see it.

230
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:18,779
- You just said you did.
- I know, I lied.

231
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:22,862
I didn't want her to think
I was a terrible mother.

232
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:28,779
Come here. Sure you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

233
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:36,946
Oh, it's beautiful.

234
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:39,941
I see it now.

235
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,825
- Do you really?
- No, I don't see it!

236
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:46,582
Come on. All right. Okay. Okay.

237
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:52,539
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

238
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,698
Sweetie, that's it.

239
00:19:56,908 --> 00:20:01,743
That's it? Well, I saw that.

240
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:09,737
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

241
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:17,343
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

242
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:22,937
Yeah, that's our baby.

243
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:35,385
- So how was the doctor?
- It went great.

244
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:39,217
- Good.
- Show them the picture of your uterus.

245
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:46,340
I don't see the baby.

246
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:50,939
I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right...

247
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:54,745
Ross, I lost it again.

248
