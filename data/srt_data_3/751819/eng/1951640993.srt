1
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:45,619
Humphrey, what are you havering about?

2
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,250
I'm simply saying we can't take
the Minister's approval for granted.

3
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,013
The Italian government
have offered a massive contract

4
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,455
to manufacture propanol
at our Merseyside plant,

5
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,932
which means saving a plant
we were going to have to close,

6
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:03,888
saving jobs, earning export royalties.

7
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,291
- He has to give us the go-ahead.
- But if the Minister thinks...

8
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,131
Ministers don't think!

9
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,050
Don't talk to me about Ministers.

10
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,768
I've been chairman of British
Chemical Corporation for ten years,

11
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,568
and in that time dealt
with nineteen different Ministers.

12
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,174
They've usually not had time to see me,

13
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:29,289
because they're too busy bribing
Trade Union leaders not to strike.

14
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,611
- They've never bribed anybody.
- Oh, no?

15
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,250
"Have a quango, Tom;
a knighthood, Dick; a peerage, Harry."

16
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,094
- But the Minister's worried...
- Of course he's worried!

17
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,379
If I'd never done anything to worry
those vote-grabbing baby-kissing jellies,

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,008
we'd have gone down the tube years ago!

19
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:52,138
- But propanol contains metadioxin.
- So what?

20
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,054
Dioxin was released at Seveso.
It can damage the foetus.

21
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,497
That's dioxin, for Christ's sake!
Metadioxin is an inert compound.

22
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,936
It's been given a clean bill
of health by Washington.

23
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,375
The Henderson Committee,
which you set up, will give it the OK, too.

24
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,374
I know, Wally, but the name
could be politically sensitive.

25
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,372
But I've taken metadioxin out of the proposal.

26
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,973
- I call it propanol.
- Very wise of you.

27
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:20,530
- You told me to.
- Very wise of me!

28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,536
But the Minister may raise
no objections, it just needs tact.

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,214
Fine. In that case, there's no problem.

30
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:36,137
I'll have a tactful word with Hacker
and persuade the blancmange myself.

31
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,970
Don't take this amiss, Wally,

32
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:46,089
but I might just be able to manage
without your unique... brand of tact.

33
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,457
- This is wonderful news, Humphrey.
- Yes, Minister.

34
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,092
We turn a run-down plant from
loss-maker into a profitable unit,

35
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,093
the largest manufacturer of propanol in Europe.

36
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,888
- Yes, Minister.
- Equipment made in UK factories.

37
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:06,973
Income for the local authorities,
foreign exchange from exports.

38
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,370
- Too good to be true!
- It is true.

39
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,692
Good old propanol... What is propanol, actually?

40
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,651
It used to be made with dioxin
until the Seveso explosion,

41
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,450
then they developed a safe compound,
metadioxin.

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,170
The Italian factory is sealed off
so they've asked the BCC to make it.

43
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:30,570
- An ill wind.
- Quite so.

44
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,015
- But this stuff is perfectly safe?
- Perfectly.

45
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:38,571
Weak Ministers might have doubts
over the similarity of the names,

46
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,255
but no one with any backbone would
be deflected from such a beneficial project

47
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,650
on such a useless pretext.

48
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,455
I know just the sort of Minister
you mean. Political jellyfish.

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,452
Terrified of taking any decision.

50
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,612
After all, every decision
upsets someone, doesn't it?

51
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,897
Good government is doing
what's right, not just what's popular.

52
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,893
- Absolutely, Minister.
- But this will be popular?

53
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:06,735
- Very popular.
- Humphrey, I want to be sure.

54
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,655
You not asking me to make
a courageous decision, are you?

55
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,936
Of course not, Minister.

56
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,137
Good, good. Should I take it to Cabinet?

57
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,973
- I think the less said, the better.
- Why?

58
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,574
Although metadioxin is totally harmless,

59
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,049
the name may cause anxiety in ignorant minds.

60
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:29,929
Humphrey, you're talking
about my Cabinet colleagues.

61
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:32,055
I was referring to the Friends of the Earth.

62
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,539
(PHONE RINGS)

63
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,174
Yes? Joan Littler has arrived,
MP for Liverpool South West.

64
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,978
Know what she wants?

65
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,496
She's the Prime Minister's PPS,
and the new plant is in her constituency.

66
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,528
- Show her in. If you'll excuse us?
- The PM's PPS? I think I'll stay.

67
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:52,740
Joan Littler,
member for Liverpool South West.

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,653
- Do you know Humphrey Appleby?
- Delighted to meet you.

69
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,616
Do take a seat.

70
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,294
- Thank you, Bernard.
- Bernard...

71
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,460
Now, what can I do for you?

72
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,170
Jim, what's the British Chemical
Corporation up to in my constituency?

73
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,969
They'll be announcing a very
exciting project, with new jobs.

74
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,814
Yes... but there's some
very worrying rumours.

75
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,447
- Such as?
- Rumours of dangerous chemicals.

76
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,974
All chemicals are dangerous...

77
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,451
The Minister means the rumours
are unfounded, no cause for alarm.

78
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,295
Can I have your assurance
there'll be a full public enquiry?

79
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,499
Not a bad idea...

80
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,130
The Minister was about to say
there's no need for an enquiry.

81
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:46,010
- A report will be issued shortly.
- I came here to talk to Jim.

82
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,854
- You are talking to him.
- But he's not answering, you are!

83
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,454
- The Minister and I are of one mind.
- Whose? Yours?

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,494
I've heard this factory made
the chemical that poisoned Seveso!

85
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,776
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

86
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,853
The chemical in Seveso was dioxin.
This is metadioxin.

87
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:11,490
- That's virtually the same thing.
- Just a similar name.

88
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,095
It's the same name with "meta"
stuck on the front.

89
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:19,458
- That makes all the difference.
- Why? What does "meta" mean?

90
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,572
- What does "meta" mean, Humphrey?
- "With", "after" or "beyond".

91
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,768
From the Greek, of course.
"After" dioxin or "beyond" dioxin.

92
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:35,013
If it's in the accusative,
it's "beyond or after",

93
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:39,138
with the genitive it's "with",
as in Latin, as you no doubt recall.

94
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,769
The ablative is used for words
needing "with" to precede them.

95
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,818
But of course, there isn't an ablative in Greek.

96
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,972
- Well done, Bernard.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,976
- You see?
- Not exactly, no.

98
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,610
- I thought that was perfectly plain.
- What I insist on knowing

99
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,170
is what is the actual difference
between dioxin and metadioxin.

100
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,412
Metadioxin is an inert compound of dioxin.

101
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,333
I think I follow that, Humphrey,

102
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,969
but could you explain it a little more clearly?

103
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,415
- In what sense, Minister?
- What does "inert" mean?

104
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,219
It means it's not...

105
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:24,137
...ert.

106
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,853
Wouldn't "ert" a fly.

107
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,447
- What did you say, Bernard?
- Nothing, Minister.

108
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,169
- What does that mean in practical terms?
- You mean chemically?

109
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,049
- Yes, chemically.
- What does it mean chemically?

110
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:45,132
I can't explain it in layman's language...

111
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,814
- Do you know any chemistry?
- Of course not, Minister.

112
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:51,892
I was in the scholarship form.

113
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,572
Classics.

114
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,129
- And what's a compound?
- Don't you know any chemistry?

115
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,973
No. Do you?

116
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,691
- We ought to, oughtn't we?
- A compound is a...

117
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,456
You know what compound interest is?
Yes, well, a jolly good thing.

118
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,372
That's the sort of thing a compound is.

119
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:16,499
That's it, then.

120
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,937
To sum up, I think we're all
of the same mind, broadly speaking.

121
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:23,818
We're ready to go ahead.

122
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,972
I've said no such thing!

123
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,379
The only difference is in the name,

124
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,419
dioxin and metadioxin, like... Littler and Hitler.

125
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,012
Not that you're like Hitler
because your name's similar!

126
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,735
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

127
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,812
The point is this factory is in my constituency!

128
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:48,450
It'll be good for the constituency,
more jobs, more money.

129
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,329
The only people we'll offend
are a few environmentalists.

130
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,651
At most, it won't cost us more than 100 votes.

131
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,049
My majority is 91.

132
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:03,848
Not to mention the three marginal
constituencies bordering mine!

133
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,975
Could I intervene just once more?

134
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,768
The case for the BCC manufacturing
propanol is overwhelming.

135
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:11,259
Overwhelming.

136
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,299
Great jobs, increased income
and secure, profitable export orders.

137
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,018
- Export orders.
- Furthermore...

138
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:20,536
the drug has been declared safe by Washington,

139
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,009
- Washington.
- We're preparing a report, too.

140
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,010
The Minister is confident

141
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:29,253
that this scheme is to the advantage
of your constituency and the country.

142
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,049
If it proves not to be safe,
I won't allow its manufacture here.

143
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:37,929
But if the report says it is safe,
that'd be absurd, wouldn't it?

144
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,656
I'm not satisfied with that, Jim.

145
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,095
Remember that the party made you an MP,

146
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:49,856
and you can't be a Minister
if your party loses the next election.

147
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,054
You still don't look happy, Minister.

148
00:09:56,219 --> 00:10:00,576
Suppose the report isn't as conclusive as you say.

149
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,095
- Oughtn't I to meet this Henderson?
- No need.

150
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,094
He's a brilliant Cambridge
biochemist, chosen with some care.

151
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:11,536
Suppose he produces a cautious,
wait-and-see report?

152
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,692
We don't publish it.
We use the American report instead.

153
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,497
Fine!

154
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,533
- You mean we suppress it?
- No, we just don't publish it.

155
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,170
- What's the difference?
- All the difference in the world!

156
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,978
Suppression is the instrument of dictatorships.

157
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,052
We don't talk of that sort of thing
in a free country.

158
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:34,653
We take a democratic decision not to publish.

159
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,773
Fine. What am I to say
to the press and parliament?

160
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,057
"We hoped the report would say
it was a wise decision."

161
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:46,848
"But we've cocked it up so we'll
pretend the report doesn't exist."

162
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,295
- Very droll.
- What would I say?

163
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,371
There's a Government procedure for suppress...

164
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,451
...deciding not to publish reports.
- Really?

165
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,814
You simply discredit them.

166
00:10:57,979 --> 00:10:59,970
Good heavens!

167
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,052
How?

168
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:07,808
Stage One, give your reasons
in terms of the public interest.

169
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:12,370
- Hint at security considerations...
- Mind if I make a note?

170
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,567
This could be useful for discrediting
some of the party's idiotic research documents.

171
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,053
The report could put pressure on
Government and be misinterpreted.

172
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:26,929
Anything could be misinterpreted.
The Sermon on the Mount could be!

173
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:33,095
Indeed, it could be argued the Sermon
should not have been published.

174
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,210
A most irresponsible document.

175
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,848
All that stuff about the meek inheriting the earth

176
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:43,058
could do irreparable damage
to the defence budget.

177
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:45,495
I suppose you're right. What else?

178
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,130
Say it's better to wait for a more
detailed study over longer time.

179
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,572
- Suppose there isn't one?
- Commission one.

180
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,094
Gives you even more time to play with.

181
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:59,808
- All this is Stage One?
- Yes. In Stage Two...

182
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:02,414
discredit the evidence you're not publishing.

183
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,210
- How, if you're not publishing it?
- It's easier if it's not published.

184
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:10,451
Do it by press leaks, of course,
not directly.

185
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,975
Say it leaves important questions unanswered,

186
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,937
the evidence is inconclusive,

187
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:19,058
the figures are open to other interpretations,

188
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:22,735
that certain findings are contradictory,

189
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,653
and that some of the main
conclusions have been questioned.

190
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,095
- Suppose they haven't?
- Then question them!

191
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,170
Then they have!

192
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:36,290
But you'd have to go through it
with a fine-toothed comb.

193
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,612
No, no, no. You'd say all these
things without reading it.

194
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,896
There's always some questions unanswered.

195
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,177
- Such as?
- The ones that weren't asked.

196
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:49,973
- That's Stage Two?
- Yes. In Stage Three...

197
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,893
you undermine recommendations.

198
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,573
"Not a basis for long-term decisions."

199
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,973
"Not sufficient information
on which to base a valid assessment."

200
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,133
"Not really any need for
a fundamental rethink of policies."

201
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:09,293
"Broadly speaking,
endorses current practice." It's easy.

202
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,290
- That works?
- Nearly always.

203
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,213
- Suppose it doesn't?
- Move on to Stage Four.

204
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:19,134
- Stage Four?
- Discredit the man who produced the report.

205
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,892
Off the record.

206
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,098
Say that he's harbouring a grudge
against the Government

207
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:30,129
or, better still, that he used to be
a consultant to a multi-national company.

208
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,894
- Supposing he wasn't?
- Then he's hoping to be.

209
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:36,778
Everybody's hoping
to be a consultant to a multi-national.

210
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:42,219
Or he's trying for a knighthood
or vice-chancellorship.

211
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:44,973
There are endless possibilities.

212
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,539
Excuse me.

213
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,978
The press officer rang to say
there's an item on the news.

214
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,370
Yes, yes. Why wasn't I told?

215
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,737
The BCC aren't obliged to clear it with us.

216
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,649
<i>... a row has blown up on Merseyside</i>

217
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,893
<i>about a plan for the BCC</i>
<i>to manufacture propanol</i>

218
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,290
<i>under licence for the Italian government.</i>

219
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,133
<i>Apparently, propanol contains metadioxin,</i>

220
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:14,769
<i>which the BCC claims</i>
<i>to be completely harmless.</i>

221
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,407
<i>It is a compound of dioxin,</i>

222
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,655
<i>the chemical released</i>
<i>after an explosion at Seveso in July 1976,</i>

223
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,017

<i>over a 4-mile radius.</i>

224
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,735
<i>0n Merseyside, protesters voiced</i>

225
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,811

<i>(CR0WD SH0UTING AND JEERING)</i>

227
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,857
<i>I'll tell you what we'll do.</i>

228
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,013
<i>Sir Wally can take his poison</i>
<i>chemicals somewhere elsel</i>

229
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,250
<i>I've a daughter expecting a baby,</i>

<i>deformed for them bloody Eyeties' sakel</i>

231

<i>If the Government cared about people,</i>
<i>they'd never allow itl</i>

232
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,612
<i>The BCC said a report</i>
<i>on the safety of propanol</i>

233
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,295
<i>was due to be published shortly</i>

234
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,692
<i>And now abroad again...</i>

235
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,459
- This metadioxin is dynamite.
- It's totally harmless.

236
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,849
Only chemically, not politically.

237
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,490
- It can't hurt anyone.
- It could finish me off!

238
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,174
Yes? Minister, Number 10 on the phone.

239
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:35,412
The political office - the PM's just seen the news.

240
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,370
Hello, Jim here!

241
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:47,450
Yes, I just saw that, too.

242
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,897
We don't need to be too worried
about a little local difficulty.

243
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:55,768
Not in view of the jobs and exports...

244
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,491
No, not many jobs.

245
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,375
Ninety, I think.

246
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,336
Yes, but...

247
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,696
You do, do you?

248
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,816
Yes, well...

249
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:11,973
I was coming round to that viewpoint myself.

250
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,857
Humphrey...

251
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:26,296
- Something just struck me.
- I noticed.

252
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,736
There are arguments against this scheme.

253
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,335
- Minister, you've already agreed...
- It could lead to a loss of...

254
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,809
...public confidence.
- You mean votes?

255
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:45,497
Votes? No, no. It's not the votes
that are a consideration at all.

256
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,254
But you see, it's the public will.

257
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,138
This is a democracy...

258
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:54,088
- and the people don't like it.
- The people are ignorant and misguided.

259
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:56,978
It was the people who elected me!

260
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,256
In a week, the whole thing will have blown over,

261
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,857
and in a year's time,
we'll have a safe and successful factory.

262
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:08,577
A week's a long time in politics.

263
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,730
A year's a short time in Government.

264
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:14,017
You're in Government, I'm in politics
and the PM is not pleased.

265
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,252
- With the greatest respect...
- Going to insult me again?

266
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,490
You're putting party before country.

267
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,969
Can't you think of a new cliché?

268
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:28,054
Minister, a new cliché could be said
to be a contradiction in terms.

269
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:31,053
Humphrey, you lead a sheltered life.

270
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,653
I intend to survive and I'm not crossing the PM.

271
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:38,609
Why must you be so concerned
with climbing the greasy pole?

272
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:41,247
The greasy pole is important. I have to climb it.

273
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,330
Why?

274
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:45,937
'Cause it's there!

275
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,295
The editor of the Times, please.
Thank you, Bernard.

276
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:58,973
How come the Times knows
about the report before I do?

277
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:02,176
- There's been a leak.
- I know that!

278
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,854
It was "Confidential". I only got a draft last night.

279
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,328
- At least it wasn't "Restricted".
- Why?

280
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,809
"Restricted" means
it was in the papers yesterday.

281
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:15,938
"Confidential" means it won't be
in the papers till today.

282
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:17,930
Who leaked this? Humphrey?

283
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,171
- I'm sure he didn't, Minister.
- Are you?

284
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:24,571
- He probably didn't.
- No?

285
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,495
- It might have been someone else.
- These leaks are a disgrace!

286
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,618
- People think it's the politicians.
- It has been known.

287
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,488
In my opinion, we're far more
leaked against than leaking.

288
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,816
"Political cowardice to reject
the BCC proposal... craven expediency."

289
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,970
"Hacker has no choice."

290
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,528
Humphrey thinks he's got me committed!

291
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,738
It's an unofficial leak of a draft report.
You're committed to nothing.

292
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,971
Does the report give you a way out?

293
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:00,857
Sir Wally McFarlane is waiting to see you.

294
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,455
All right. But he's wasting his time.

295
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:08,609
- Come in, please, Sir Wally.
- Thank you. Morning.

296
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:11,214
- Morning.
- May I join you, Minister?

297
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,413
- If you like. Do sit down.
- Thank you, Jim.

298
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,571
- Now...
- Thank you, Bernard.

299
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,894
Sorry about that.

300
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:28,736
I see from the press the Henderson
Report comes clearly on our side.

301
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:33,928
- I've seen that, too.
- That committee leaks like a sieve.

302
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:38,491
So there's no real case for refusing
permission for the new plant.

303
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,971
- I'm not sure yet.
- Now look, Jim...

304
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:47,009
We've been working on this
for two years, it's very important.

305
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:53,448
I'm the chairman, and I tell you
as a chemist, metadioxin is safe.

306
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,929
You experts always think you're right.

307
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:59,933
The more inexpert you are,
the more likely you are to be right?

308
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,897
Ministers are not experts.

309
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,176
They're chosen because they know nothing.

310
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,490
You admit that?

311
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,651
Nothing about technical details.

312
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,649
Ministers must take a broader view,
that's why I cannot commit yet.

313
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,377
Look, Hacker!

314
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,692
This is the wrong decision and you know it.
It's cowardly and craven!

315
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:24,090
- I am not cowardly...
- Sit down!

316
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:29,413
You'll lose a few votes from a few
people in those constituencies?

317
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,696
- It's pathetic!
- It's politics!

318
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,179
Exactly!

319
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:36,616
I'll be writing to the Secretary
of State for Industry.

320
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,089
I am prepared to resign if you block this one!

321
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:49,491
How do you feel that went, Minister?

322
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,691
- We'll have to get another chairman.
- Get another?!

323
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:56,420
Nobody would accept a job like that!

324
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,255
Nobody wants to be chairman
of a nationalised industry! Instant ruin!

325
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,890
They may as well accept the golden
handshake the day they start.

326
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,654
- We'll find someone.
- Some useless American geriatric.

327
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:11,377
Not necessarily.

328
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,770
How do you expect to find
a decent replacement,

329
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:18,693
when we forced his predecessor
to resign for taking a sound decision,

330
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,975
which we blocked for political reasons?

331
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,973
- I have no choice.
- A Minister can do what he likes.

332
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:30,930
It's the people's will.
I am their leader. I must follow them.

333
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,010
My hands are clean.

334
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:38,808
I thought it was rather difficult
to keep one's hands clean

335
00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:41,368
while climbing the greasy pole.

336
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,488
We must stop Wally making a fuss.

337
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,457
Press conferences accusing me of lack of faith.

338
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,169
- Interviews on Panorama.
- What am I to do?

339
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:56,969
If I stop the scheme, the Times will
accuse me of political cowardice.

340
00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:02,134
If I let it go ahead, the Mirror
will say I'm murdering unborn babies.

341
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:06,292
If only the report had any doubt
about the safety of metadioxin.

342
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,612
- Are you sure it doesn't, Minister?
- Not as it stands.

343
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:14,135
- Henderson's a Cambridge man?
- Yes.

344
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,211
- Which college?
- King's. Why?

345
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:21,096
Nothing. Just wondered
if it was my old college.

346
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:24,456
Weren't you at the LSE?

347
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,174
Yes, so I was.

348
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:30,899
- Have you got his file?
- It's with the report.

349
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,573
- Got a Cambridge telephone...?
- You do realise -

350
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,730
not that you have any such intention -

351
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:39,973
but it would be most improper to influence
an independent report of this nature?

352
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:42,255
Most improper! Out of the question.

353
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,379
Just it might be nice to pop down
to have tea with my old friend,

354
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,419
R.A. Crichton, Provost of King's.
Get him on the phone.

355
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,491
Yes, Minister.
Get me King's College, Cambridge.

356
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,370
Who knows? Professor Henderson
might drop in for tea.

357
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,054
That'd be a happy coincidence, wouldn't it?

358
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:05,133
- Perfectly natural.
- Nothing improper about that.

359
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:08,814
- How can a coincidence be improper?
- My feeling entirely.

360
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:10,299
(PHONE RINGS)

361
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,973
Yes?

362
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:14,853
Lord Crichton, please.

363
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,772
How's the move
from the Commons to the Lords?

364
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:32,295
Like moving from animals to vegetables.

365
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,611
- Professor Henderson's here.
- Good to see you.

366
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:38,419
Come and meet an old friend,
Jim Hacker.

367
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,732
- Jim, this is Professor Henderson.
- Professor Henderson!

368
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,049
I didn't expect to see the Minister.

369
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:49,179
- What a coincidence!
- Yes, what a coincidence!

370
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:51,615
- You know each other?
- We haven't met.

371
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:55,897
- I'm writing a report for him.
- Well, what a coincidence.

372
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,575
- Yes, what a coincidence!
- Extraordinary coincidence.

373
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,527
- You're happy with my report?
- Absolutely. Delighted.

374
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,612
- You must've worked very hard.
- Most of it was done by Washington.

375
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,089
Excuse me, I'll go and help with the tea.

376
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:14,774
Tell me, have you ever written
a Government report before?

377
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:19,171
- No.
- Your name will be on it forever.

378
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:20,658
"Henderson Report".

379
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:24,528
- It's a kind of immortality.
- I hadn't thought of it like that.

380
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:28,576
- But if it were to go wrong...
- Go wrong?

381
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:33,769
If this metadioxin isn't as safe as you say...

382
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,419
your career...

383
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,013
Very courageous!

384
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:42,411
None of the standard tests show
any evidence of teratogenic toxicity.

385
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,295
- Standard tests? Quite.
- What do you mean?

386
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,214
Well, I was making a few notes
on the train coming down.

387
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:55,212
I'm not a biochemist, but it would appear

388
00:24:55,379 --> 00:25:00,692
that the US report leaves some
important questions unanswered.

389
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:04,738
Some of the evidence is inconclusive,
some findings have been questioned,

390
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:07,413
the figures are open to interpretation,

391
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,018
and different results might come
from a more detailed study.

392
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:17,651
- Obviously, but...
- But if anything did go wrong,

393
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:21,607
a delayed effect, the press
would go straight to your report.

394
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,010
And if it turned out that you'd ever done...

395
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:31,219
...laboratory trials
for a multi-national drug company...

396
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:35,134
- That was 15 years ago.
- 14.

397
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,654
You know what the press is like.

398
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:41,893
No smoke without a fire.
It could be a millstone!

399
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,371
The popular press would be merciless,
if anything went wrong:

400
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,009
"Death Agony
of Henderson Report Victims."

401
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:52,090
Yes...

402
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,658
Yes...!

403
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,849
I don't know what to do!

404
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:01,218
I can't alter the evidence,
the report says it's a safe drug.

405
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:05,134
- Quite. I see you have no choice.
- Stop talking shop.

406
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,292
Our Professor of Economics
is dying to talk to you.

407
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,971
You're not worried about this report?
I've done lots of these things.

408
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:22,611
It's the phrasing of the conclusion,
that's all the press ever read.

409
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:24,849
Now... how does it end?

410
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:30,777
"On existing evidence, the committee
can see no reason not to proceed."

411
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:35,411
Well, it's just a question
of a tidy bit of re-drafting.

412
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:42,018
"While the committee feel there's no reason
not to proceed on existing evidence,

413
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:47,049
"it must be emphasised that
metadioxin is a recent compound,

414
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:51,497
"and it would be irresponsible
to deny, after further research,

415
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,415
"its manufacture might be proved
to be associated with health risks."

416
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,094
Yes, that seems perfectly fair.

417
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,693
Could you just say that again?

418
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,010
Better than that... I'll jot it down for you.

419
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:10,091
<i>The Minister for Administrative</i>
<i>Affairs, James Hacker,</i>

420
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:15,652
<i>has announced he'll not give approval</i>
<i>for the BCC to make propanol.</i>

421
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:19,175
<i>The Henderson Committee,</i>
<i>while generally approving the drug,</i>

422
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:23,935
<i>said it could not deny that future</i>
<i>research might disclose risks.</i>

423
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:26,408
(CROWDS CHEERING)

424
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:31,616
<i>Mr Hacker made his announcement</i>
<i>today while visiting BCC's factory,</i>

425
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:35,375
<i>where he was greeted</i>
<i>by an enthusiastic crowd.</i>

426
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:39,568
<i>And now sport.</i>
<i>Following last night's defeat...</i>

427
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,853
Well, Minister?

428
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:43,737
Well, Humphrey?

429
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:46,732
- Do you feel like a hero?
- Indeed I do.

430
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,893
- And Number 10 will be delighted.
- One of the worst decisions ever!

431
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,937
And one of the best political decisions I've made.

432
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:57,413
What do you think, Bernard?

433
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,013
Well...

434
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:04,254
bearing everything in mind
and after due consideration...

435
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,616
considering all the implications
and points of view...

436
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:13,411
well, in other words,
in fact, I am bound to say...

437
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,129
you look awfully good on television, Minister.

438
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:21,054
Humphrey, can we manage a CBE for Henderson?

439
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:25,133
Certainly not! He's unreliable
and lacking in judgement.

440
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:29,292
I can't think why he cast doubt
on his whole report in that final paragraph.

441
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,089
I think he has excellent judgement,
enormous stature and great charm.

442
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,419
I thought you said you'd never met him.

443
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,019
I meant intellectual stature, Humphrey.

444
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,170
And charm?

445
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,337
He writes with charm.

446
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,051
Doesn't he, Bernard?

447
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:58,211
Oh, yes, Minister.
