1
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:04,875
我刚读到一个实验
I just read about an experiment designed

2
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:06,209
他们想看看能否在几个小时内
to see if you could make two people fall

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:08,145
让两个人坠入爱河
in love in a matter of hours.

4
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:09,713
这不太对吧
That doesn't sound right.

5
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:11,982
我的研究显示 这需要三到五年的
My research has shown that it takes three to five years

6
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:14,584
厚脸皮和苦苦哀求
of shameless begging.

7
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:17,621
亲爱的 你这个故事讲出来 我们谁都不好看
Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.

8
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:18,956
对 我...
Yeah, I... I...

9
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,158
我看过你说的那篇文章
I saw that article you're talking about.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,193
参与者会相互问一系列问题
Uh, the participants ask each other a series

11
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:25,829
以增进彼此的亲密度
of questions designed to promote intimacy.

12
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:27,197
最后则需要

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,999
深情对望四分钟
into each other's eyes for four minutes.

14
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,434
那是胡说
Oh, that's nonsense.

15
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:32,569
我表明了对你的爱
I proclaimed my love for you.

16
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,171
可上次我看着你的眼睛
And the last time I looked into your eyes

17
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:37,174
还是因为你觉得自己得了结膜炎
was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.

18
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:39,443
虽说我的确患病了
Other than the fact that I had it,

19
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,244
但那晚真的很棒
that was a magical night.

20
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:45,148
Raj 你和Emily尝试过类似的实验吗?
Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?

21
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,484
什么? 我不需要用科学来应得她的芳心
What? I don't need science to win her heart.

22
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:50,387
我可以用家产打动她
I have my family's wealth for that.

23
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:52,723
我是说 你没法在几个小时里创造爱情
I'm telling you, you can't create love in a few hours.

24
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,424
- 对吧?  - 说话小心
- Right?  - Oh, careful.

25
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:57,194
你这是在质疑"非诚勿扰"的能力
You're poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.

26
00:00:57,196 --> 00:00:58,562
没错
Yeah, but

27
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:00,464
但我们不必争论
we don't have to debate this.

28
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:01,732
我们是科学家
We're scientists.

29
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,867
可以进行自己的研究
We can conduct our own research.

30
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,802
我提议 我们去抓
Yeah, I propose that we imprison

31
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,104
- 两个路人来  - 不行
- two street people.  - No.

32
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:09,673
然后...
And...

33
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:11,008
你都没让我说完
You didn't even let me finish.

34
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,909
- 想都别想!  - 哦!
- Forget it!  - Oh!

35
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:15,245
你就可以随心所欲在猿类身上做实验
So, you can experiment on all the apes you want.

36
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:17,848
但我要抓两个人来控制他们的感情
But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive

37
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,817
你倒觉得我是怪物了
human beings, suddenly I'm the monster.

38
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,486
你为什么
Why don't you

39
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,454
不自己做测试呢?
just do the test?

40
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:27,591
为了科学事业 我很愿意
In the interest of science, I'd be willing to.

41
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:29,192
什么? 你竟然同意参与需要你
What? You're okay with an experiment where you have

42
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:32,562
回答关于心灵深处感受的尴尬问题的实验?
to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?

43
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:33,830
没错
Yes.

44
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:35,966
拜托 我能和他一起吗? 求你了?!
Please, can I do it with him? Please?!

45
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:39,636
我听了十年Sheldon的感受了
I've been listening to Sheldon's feelings on things

46
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:42,172
换你 你上吧
for ten years. Tag, you're it.

47
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:44,841
那万一实验奏效了呢?
Yeah, but what if the experiment works?

48
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:46,610
我不会爱上Sheldon的
I'm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.

49
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:47,677
我也觉得不会
That's what I said.

50
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,246
在我发现之前 他就偷偷
Before I knew it, he pontificated his way

51
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:51,281
溜进了我的心里
right into my heart.

52
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:54,017
趣味知识... "pontificate"
Uh, fun fact... "pontificate"

53
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,119
是由拉丁语里的"pontifex"一词而来
comes from the Latin word "pontifex,"

54
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:58,388
意为"桥梁建造者"或"教皇"
which means "bridge builder" or "Pope."

55
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:02,993
爱上了吗?
In love yet?

56
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:07,731
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

57
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:11,068
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

58
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,702
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

59
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:15,272
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

60
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:17,908
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

61
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,577
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

62
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,479
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

63
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,448
生活大爆炸 第八季第16集

我只是好奇问问 Penny
Just out of curiosity, Penny,

68
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:39,129
如果这个实验真的让我们相爱了
if this experiment does make us fall in love,

69
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,431
你愿意开车送我去威斯康星州日内瓦湖市的
would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin

70
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,301
Gary游戏展吗?
for Gary Con?

71
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,103
这是唯一一个纪念
It's the only convention celebrating

72
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:49,472
"龙与地下城"之父Gary Gygax
the life and work of Gary Gygax,

73
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:52,675
生平和作品的展会
the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.

74
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:54,377
知道吗?
You know what?

75
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,145
老实说 只要我们相爱了
I can honestly say if we fall in love,

76
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:58,147
我不仅会开车送你去那儿 那些龙T恤什么的
not only will I drive you there, I will buy you

77
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:00,349
我也会全买给你
all the dragon T-shirts you want.

78
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,453
好 宝贝 来吧
Okay, babe, let's do this.

79
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:09,625
Penny和Sheldon做这个实验
You guys are really being calm

80
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:11,761
你们两个还真是淡定
about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing.

81
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:12,895
换做是我
If it were me,

82
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:14,263
我... 会有点小紧张
I... I'd be a little nervous.

83
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:15,398
- 为什么?  - 是这样
- Why?  - Well,

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,599
哪怕这个研究是扯淡
even if the study's nonsense,

85
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,235
我... 并不相信冒险会有好结果
I... I don't believe in tempting fate.

86
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:21,304
所以我不会去玩显灵板
Same reason I wouldn't use a Ouija board,

87
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:23,906
也不会挑衅亚洲人
or pick a fight with an Asian guy.

88
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:27,009
他可能不会空手道 但... 何必冒险呢?
He probably doesn't know karate, but... why risk it?

89
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,345
我觉得我们很安全
I think we're safe.

90
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:30,580
在高中欺负李小龙的
Well, that's what the bullies

91
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:31,881
那些家伙也这么想
at Bruce Lee's high school thought.

92
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:33,015
结果被一拳揍倒!
And then, bam!

93
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:34,984
空手道
Karate.

94
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:36,719
他们做实验的时候
Well, are we just gonna

95
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,721
我们就干等着吗?
sit here while they do the experiment?

96
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:40,256
我们也可以做呀
The two of us could do it.

97
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:41,924
好啊 应该会很有趣
Yeah, sure, that might be fun.

98
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:42,892
第一个问题是什么?
What's the first question?

99
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:44,260
等等
Hang on.

100
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:45,494
好了
Okay.

101
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:49,232
"在全世界所有人中
"Given the choice of anyone in the world,

102
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:52,602
你最想和谁共进晚餐?"
whom would you want as a dinner guest?"

103
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:53,936
嗯
Hmm.

104
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,606
老实说 我会选Penny
I can honestly say Penny.

105
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,408
噢... 那我就选个保洁员
Oh... then I choose a janitor.

106
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,944
因为我要吐了
'Cause I'm about to throw up.

107
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:04,547
我热恋着呢
I'm in love.

108
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,183
我们干点别的吧
Let's do something else.

109
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:09,418
Emily马上就要下班了
Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon.

110
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,187
要不我们四个出去玩吧?
Why don't the four of us go out?

111
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,221
好 听上去不错
Okay. Sounds good.

112
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:13,522
我们应该打电话给Howard和Bernadette吗?
Should we call Howard and Bernadette?

113
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:15,057
我不知道他们的飞机什么时候到
I don't know what time their plane gets in,

114
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,993
我发个短信给他们吧
but let me, let me shoot them a text.

115
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,195
他说了葬礼的事吗?
Did he say anything about the funeral?

116
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:22,732
没说什么 但他似乎状态还不错
Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.

117
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:24,066
开什么玩笑?!
Are you kidding me?!

118
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,902
你弄丢了我妈的骨灰?!
You lost my mother's ashes?!

119
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:29,205
不... 我只是说有时候
No, I... I'm just saying that sometimes

120
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,740
行李会被误转
bags are misrouted.

121
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:32,675
好吧 行 你们把唯一一个
All right, fine. Where did you misroute

122
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,477
爱过我的女人发错到哪里去了?
the only woman who ever loved me?

123
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,613
是第一个... 呃 第一个 我是说第一个
The first... well, first, I meant first.

124
00:04:37,615 --> 00:04:40,116
我需要一些信息
I just need some information.

125
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:42,084
呃 你们的航班号码是多少?
Uh, what's the flight number?

126
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:43,352
是816
816.

127
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:44,987
我真的是想说第一个的
I really did mean first.

128
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,390
别提了
Just drop it.

129
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:48,924
你能描述一下那个包吗?
And can you describe the bag?

130
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:50,259
嗯 呃
Um, well,

131
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,327
它 呃 是黑色的
it's, uh, black.

132
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,628
把手上系了一根红色的带子...
There's a red ribbon tied to the handle...

133
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,097
放鞋的那儿放了全世界最棒的妈妈!
The world's greatest mom is in the shoe compartment!

134
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,234
你准备好开始了吗?
You ready to begin?

135
00:04:58,236 --> 00:04:59,769
好了 马上就来
Yup. Be right there.

136
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:01,404
我想你大概不要葡萄酒吧
I assume you don't want wine.

137
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:03,439
是的 在操作重型机械的时候
Correct. You're not supposed to drink alcohol

138
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,941
我们是不能喝酒的
when operating heavy machinery.

139
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:07,843
什么重型机械?
What heavy machinery?

140
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:13,182
我们开始吧
Let's just start.

141
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,418
呃 作为一个来自德克萨斯州的绅士
Well, as a Texas gentleman,

142
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,453
我想说女士优先
I'm inclined to say ladies first.

143
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:20,356
但是 我担心这种水平的礼貌和魅力
Although, I'm concerned that level of politeness and charm

144
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:23,793
可能在实验开始之前就让你爱上我的
might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins.

145
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:25,761
也许我们应该投硬币
Perhaps we should flip a coin.

146
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,563
或者 如果你对石头剪刀布
Or if you're familiar with the rules

147
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:28,964
的规则很了解的话...
of Rock, Paper, Scissors...

148
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,232
第一个问题
Question one.

149
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:32,201
"如果你可以
"Given the choice

150
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:33,769
"选择这个世界上的任何人 你会邀请谁
"of anyone in the world, whom would you want

151
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:35,438
和你共进晚餐?"
as a dinner guest?"

152
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,772
嗯
Hmm.

153
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:38,007
活着的还是去世了的?
Living or dead?

154
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,942
它说"世界上的任何人"
Just says "anyone in the world."

155
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:41,210
我猜要活着的吧
I guess that means living.

156
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,311
啊 这样也行
Ah, that's just as well.

157
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:44,313
虽然我想和欧几里得见面...
As much as I'd love to meet Euclid...

158
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:46,048
他是几何证明的发明者...
inventor of the geometric proof...

159
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,650
他估计会穿着拖鞋 而我在吃晚饭的时候
he probably wore sandals and I cannot

160
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:50,052
不能看到脚趾
look at toes during dinner.

161
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:53,322
哦 我知道了!
Oh, I know!

162
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:55,057
那个我想和他一起共进晚餐的人
The person I'd most like to have dinner with

163
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:58,427
是我自己
is myself.

164
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,895
你确定你要选这个?
You sure that's your choice?

165
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:02,031
我对这挺有经验的
'Cause I've had that dinner.

166
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,466
呃 我还没有呢
Well, I haven't.

167
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:05,368
虽然他们说永远不要和你的偶像见面
And while they say never meet your heroes,

168
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,303
但我觉得我不可能会失望
I just don't see how I could disappoint.

169
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:09,538
你会选谁?
Who would you choose?

170
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,741
- 小罗伯特·唐尼  - 你...
- Robert Downey, Jr.  - You...

171
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:12,908
哦!
Oh!

172
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,911
我没想到钢铁侠
I didn't think of Iron Man.

173
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,048
其实 也许我和我自己吃好晚饭之后
You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner,

174
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,417
我们可以来和你们两个人一起吃甜点
we can meet you two for dessert.

175
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:26,088
那你们打算干什么?
So, what do you guys want to do?

176
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,124
呃 我们反正是跟着你们的 你选吧
Well, we're the ones tagging along, you pick.

177
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,191
哦!
Ooh!

178
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:31,193
你们去玩过密室逃脱吗?
Have you ever been to an escape room?

179
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,795
嗯 那是什么?  - 嗯...
Mm-mm, what's that?  - Um...

180
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,296
它有点像一个互动式的剧院
it's kind of like interactive theater,

181
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,698
你需要在规定时间内
except you have to solve puzzles

182
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,466
解开各种谜题 并逃出房间
in a certain amount of time to get out.

183
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:38,734
在市中心有一家
There's one downtown where they

184
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:40,302
他们把你和一个僵尸一起关在房间里
trap you in a room with a zombie.

185
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:42,304
哦!
Oh!

186
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:44,607
也就是说有点像现在Penny的情况
So, kind of like what's happening with Penny right now.

187
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:49,712
"对你来说
"What would constitute

188
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:52,248
完美的一天需要哪些东西?"
a perfect day for you?"

189
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,983
呃 这...
Uh, well...

190
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:57,453
我估计会睡个懒觉 做点瑜伽
I'd probably sleep in, do a little yoga,

191
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,455
然后躺在沙滩上
then lie on the beach while

192
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:02,191
帅气的小哥给我拿饮料...
cute cabana boys brought me drinks and...

193
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:04,293
也许做个按摩 然后晚上
probably get a massage and then cap off the night

194
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,295
去跳舞
with some dancing.

195
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:08,564
- 就这些?  - 是啊 怎么了?
- That's it?  - Yeah, why?

196
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:10,433
你没提到Leonard
You didn't mention Leonard.

197
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,904
他在那
He's there.

198
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:17,339
我不觉得
I don't think so.

199
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:18,607
Leonard受不了
Leonard can't stand

200
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:22,111
瑜伽 海滩 按摩和跳舞
yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.

201
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,179
那他带了一本书 行了吗?
Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay?

202
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,414
- 你的完美一天呢?  - 呃...
- What's yours?  - Yeah...

203
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,417
呃 我醒来
Uh, I wake up.

204
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:31,587
享受一点法式土司配黄油和糖浆
Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup.

205
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,657
呃 然后一个虫洞打开了
Uh, then a wormhole opens,

206
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,160
把我带到了几百万年之后的未来
and whisks me millions of years

207
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:40,796
我用我极高的智力
into the future where my towering intellect

208
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:44,300
去拯救被一个噬人的外星种族入侵之后
is used to save the last remnants of mankind

209
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:46,802
残存的人类
from a predatory alien race.

210
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,240
真有趣 你没有提到Amy
Interesting, you didn't mention Amy.

211
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:55,911
那你以为法式土司配黄油和糖浆是谁做的?
Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?

212
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:58,547
你们即将进入
You're about to enter the lab

213
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,916
已故的David Saltzberg博士的实验室
of the late Dr. David Saltzberg.

214
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,751
当他在研究减缓老化进程时
While conducting studies on slowing

215
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,621
发生了一起灾难性的事故
the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident

216
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,456
他死了
and he died.

217
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:10,860
他真的死了?
Or did he?

218
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,229
女士优先?
Ladies?

219
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,930
你是礼貌还是害怕?
Are you being polite or scared?

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,100
是啊
Yup.

221
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:22,605
啊 这房间真厉害!
Ah, what a room!

222
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,874
- 哦哦!  - 哦!
- Oh-oh!  - Oh!

223
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:28,444
这真酷
This is cool.

224
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:29,845
那我们怎么开始?
So, how do we start?

225
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,248
我们需要寻找藏在房间里的线索
We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.

226
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,716
呃 不是应该有一个僵尸吗?
Uh, wasn't there supposed to be a zombie?

227
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,219
哦!
Ooh!

228
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,222
好吧 我希望线索是写在
Okay, let's hope one of the clues

229
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:42,558
干净的内裤上面
is written on a pair of clean underwear.

230
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:46,328
Wolowitz夫妇?
Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz?

231
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,565
据我所知 你们的包裹被运到了洛杉矶
As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.

232
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,166
那它在哪?
So, where is it?

233
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,868
我不知道 也许某人
I don't know, perhaps somebody

234
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,803
一不小心把它拿走了?
took it off the carousel by mistake?

235
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:58,040
也就是说 我的妈妈在一个陌生人手里?
So, some stranger has my mom?

236
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,842
你是在跟我说
Is that what you're telling me,

237
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:03,612
现在我可怜的妈妈在洛杉矶的某个角落?
my poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?

238
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:06,215
我... 我希望我能这么说
I... I wish I was telling you that.

239
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:07,650
呃...
Um...

240
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:08,817
那位乘客也可能登上了
But the passenger could've gotten

241
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:10,719
一架国际航班
on an international flight.

242
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,788
噢 好吧!
Oh, okay, great!

243
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,357
所以 你唯一的工作就是找丢失的行李
So, your entire job is to find lost luggage,

244
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,892
结果你把范围缩小 告诉我
and you've narrowed down the location

245
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:20,162
我妈在地球上!
of my mother to the planet Earth!

246
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:21,497
对不起!
I'm sorry!

247
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:23,933
补偿你们500英里积分可以吗?
W-Would 500 frequent-flyer miles help?

248
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:26,335
足可以送你们到圣克拉门托了
That could get you to Sacramento.

249
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,307
"如果你明天早上醒来
"If you could wake up tomorrow,

250
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:34,643
发现自己拥有了一种美德或者能力
having gained any one quality or ability,

251
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,111
它会是什么呢?"
what would it be?"

252
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:38,614
呃 不是故意想跟圣经学
Well, not to steal from the Bible,

253
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:42,384
但要是能把水变成酒 那真不错
but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.

254
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:48,424
你觉得你很不严肃
I don't think you're taking this seriously.

255
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,092
得了吧 我只是和你开个玩笑而已
Come on, I'm just having some fun with you.

256
00:09:50,094 --> 00:09:51,226
我认为
I believe,

257
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:53,329
你是在用你的幽默
what you're doing is using humor

258
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,397
来掩盖自己的脆弱
to avoid vulnerability.

259
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,566
好吧
Fine.

260
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,202
认真的说...
Honestly...

261
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:03,038
如果我能有一项美德...
if I could have one quality...

262
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,809
我希望我能向你们一样聪明
I wish I could be as smart as you guys.

263
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:10,145
哈! 做你的白日梦吧
Ha! Keep dreaming.

264
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,747
Sheldon你!
Sheldon!

265
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:12,815
对不起
I'm sorry.

266
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,617
我只是和你开个小玩笑罢了
That was me having fun with you.

267
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:16,185
瞧
Look.

268
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,354
你可能在学术上...
You may not be as...

269
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:21,657
没我们那么卓越
academically inclined as are we.

270
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,826
对 话是这么说的
Yes, that's how you say it.

271
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:25,761
但是
But...

272
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:29,598
你也拥有一个让我妒忌的能力
You possess an intelligence I envy,

273
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,034
这也是我的答案
which leads me to my answer.

274
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:33,769
我想要一种能力
I would choose the ability

275
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:36,338
能读懂别人的心思
to read people's minds.

276
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,575
好吧 我读不懂别人的心思
Well, I can't read people's minds.

277
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:41,043
其实 也不是
Actually, that's not true.

278
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,378
我可以看懂男人的心思
I can read men's minds.

279
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,847
因为通常他们都是同一个想法
But only 'cause it's usually the one thing.

280
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:49,251
我们什么时候能用上机器眼?
When are we going to get robot eyes?

281
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:52,955
是啊男人都一样
You're all alike.

282
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:55,324
好吧 我是想说...
Well, what I meant was...

283
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:57,693
我总是错误的理解
I often misinterpret

284
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:59,395
别人的感受
how others are feeling.

285
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,331
比方说 我经常不明白别人只是随意笑一笑呢
Like, I can't always tell if someone is only joking

286
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,333
还是在嘲笑我
or laughing at me.

287
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:06,769
你知道的 好比说 他们是对我很生气呢
You know, like, uh, if they're mad at something I've done

288
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:08,737
还是仅仅心情不好
or just in a bad mood.

289
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,639
这... 这总令我压力山大
It... it's incredibly stressful.

290
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,509
真的吗? 你好像总是自信满满啊
Really? You always seem so confident.

291
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:14,743
呃 我不是的
Well, I'm not.

292
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:16,578
如果我能看懂别人的心思的话
And if I could read people's minds,

293
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,815
生活就会变得简单多了
life would be so much simpler.

294
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:22,751
呃 我现在想
Well, now I wish I had

295
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,554
有一种能力去帮你减轻这种烦恼了
the ability to make that stuff easier for you.

296
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:28,757
谢谢你
Thank you.

297
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,396
哇 我刚刚感觉到了
Wow, I just felt this wave

298
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:37,966
对你的一股爱意
of affection for you.

299
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:41,637
你确定你不是喝了太多"果"汁?
You sure it's not too much Bible juice?

300
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,308
现在爱意没了
And the wave is gone.

301
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:55,445
大脑!
Brains!

302
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:59,015
安静点! 我们在工作呢
Keep it down! We're working here.

303
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:00,450
好的 我们解开了密码!
Okay, we've got the cipher decoded!

304
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,651
那个地球仪怎么样了?
How's it going with the globe?

305
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,619
我们正在用坐标定位城市
We used the coordinates to locate the cities.

306
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,188
我正把城市名填到格子里
I'm putting the city names in the grid now.

307
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,956
就能得到密码箱的密码
I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.

309
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,226
慢点!
Slow down!

310

好的! 得到密码了
Yup! Got the code.

311
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,463
跟你们说...
Just saying...

提前通关不会退钱的!
no refund for finish early!

313
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,572
你确定不想回家吗?
Sure you don't want to go home?

314
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:25,141
如果行李被找回来 他们会给我们送回去的
When the bag's returned, they'll deliver it to us.

315
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:28,111
不 没找到她我不会走的
No, I'm not leaving without her.

316
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,279
好吧 我们等
All right, we'll wait.

317
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,818
我可以送她去的
I could've driven her.

318
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,487
什么?
What?

319
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,757
那天她要去佛罗里达
The day she left for Florida.

320
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,726
她问我能不能开车送她去机场
She asked me to drive her to the airport.

321
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:47,964
我... 我太忙了
I... I was too busy.

322
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,665
然后...
And...

323
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:53,369
我给她叫了一辆出租车
I made her take a cab.

324
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:57,707
我太忙了
I was too busy.

325
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,543
你当时又不知道
There's no way you could've known.

326
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,347
等我一下
Be right back.

327
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:09,118
打扰一下?
Excuse me?

328
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
嗯?
Yes?

329
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,856
你最好把我丈夫的妈妈找到
You better find my husband's mother,

330
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,224
不管是谁
cause one way or another,

331
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:18,694
反正我们要带个死人出机场!
we're walking out of this airport with a dead woman!

332
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:25,368
我们要找哪一本书? 呃...
Which book are we looking for? Uh...

333
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,136
物种起源
Origin of Species.

334
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,338
在这儿
Here it is.

335
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,373
这里有个紫外线灯
There's a black light.

336
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,675
噢 等一下
Oh, hang on.

337
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,578
好的
Oh, okay.

338
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,113
呃 "我没有兄弟姐妹
Uh, "Brothers and sisters

339
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,781
但这个人的父亲
I have none, but this man's father

340
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:42,151
是我父亲的儿子 那么我是谁?"
is my father's son. Who am I looking at?"

341
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,023
行了 我们知道了... 你想吃大脑 安静点
Yeah, yeah, we get it... you want brains. Calm down.

342
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,991
呃 如果我没有兄弟
Well, if I don't have a brother,

343
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,561
那么我父亲的儿子就是我
my father's son is me.

344
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,096
如果我是这人的父亲 那他就是我儿子
And if I'm this man's father, then he's my son.

345
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:55,398
答案就是"儿子"
The answer's "son."

346
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,632
{\an8}(儿子和太阳发音一致)

347
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,632
噢! 那里有一张太阳的图片
Ooh! There's a picture of the sun over there.

348
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,234
钥匙肯定就在那后面
I bet the key's behind it.

349
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:01,037
也可能在其他地方!  
Could be somewhere else!

350
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,405
噢 拿到钥匙了!
Oh, got the key!

351
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,140
这就是那扇门的钥匙?
So, that's the key to the door?

352
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:05,274
这就完了?
That's it?

353
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:08,411
我们为了六分钟的乐子花了200大洋?
We spent $200 on six minutes of fun?

354
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,746
感觉像是你买的那架遥控直升机
It's like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter,

355
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:13,516
就这么... 飞走了
and it just... flew away.  

356
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:18,154
真抱歉 各位 还以为谜题会更难解点
Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.

357
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:21,524
话又说回来 我们确实都有高等学位
Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.

358
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:25,394
写评论的时候别忘这一点!
Remember that before you post on Yelp!

359
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,433
"如果你今晚就要死去
"If you were to die this evening with no opportunity

360
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,968
"且不能与人交流
"to communicate with anyone,

361
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,904
你最后悔没告诉别人什么?"
what would you most regret not having told someone?"

362
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,673
也就是今天吗?
So, it would be today?

363
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,675
哈
Huh.

364
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,677
我觉得能在生日当天死去
Well, I suppose there's something satisfying

365
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,480
也挺满足的
about dying on my birthday.

366
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:46,816
今天是你的生日?
Today's your birthday?

367
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:47,950
是啊
Yes.

368
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:49,986
这可一直是个秘密啊!
Well, that's always been a secret!

369
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,954
连Amy都不知道!
Not even Amy knows!

370
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:55,825
我不喜欢收礼
Well, I don't enjoy presents.

371
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:57,293
还有光是想想大家
And the thought of people

372
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,929
跳出来大喊"没想到吧!" 就让人
jumping out and yelling "Surprise!" fills me

373
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,997
心生恐惧 甚至比听到
with more dread than the words

374
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,834
"乔治·卢卡斯导演剪辑版"还可怕
"George Lucas Director's Cut."

375
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,834
{\an8}乔治·卢卡斯 "星球大战"导演

376
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,169
那你为什么还是告诉了我?
So, why did you finally tell me?

377
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:10,006
这个实验要的就是
The point of the experiment is

378
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:12,308
对彼此完全坦白
to be completely honest with each other.

379
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,278
谢谢与我分享此事
Well, thank you for sharing it with me.

380
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,113
我不会说出去的
I won't tell anyone.

381
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,015
谢谢你
Thank you.

382
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,149
说来好笑
That is so funny.

383
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,418
我怎么都觉得你不像双鱼座的
I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.

384
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,521
你现在这样让人很难喜欢你
You're making it difficult to love you right now.

385
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,259
好消息! 您的包还回来了
Great news! Your bag was returned.

386
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:32,028
谢天谢地!
Oh, thank God!

387
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,729
没事了 她在这呢!
It's okay, she's here!

388
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:34,830
老妈在这
Ma's here.

389
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,365
那好 多谢你了
Okay, thank you so much.

390
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,000
妈?
Ma?

391
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:39,802
真抱歉 我没有
I'm sorry I didn't

392
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:42,405
送你去机场 我只想让你知道
take you to the airport. I just want you to know

393
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:45,308
我不会原谅自己的自私的
that I'll never forgive myself for being so selfish.

394
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,809
并且我承诺
And I promise

395
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,644
会用我的余生
to keep you close

396
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:51,747
时刻守护着你
for the rest of my life.

397
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:55,518
惨了 那东西会放我卧室里了
Oh, no. That thing's gonna end up in my bedroom.

398
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,256
好了! 问题全问完了
That's it! We're done with the questions.

399
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:01,791
接下来就只要
All that's left to do is

400
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:02,758
凝视对方四分钟
stare into each other's eyes

401
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,226
并且不能说话
for four minutes without talking.

402
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:06,062
好的 等等!
Okay. Wait, hang on!

403
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,631
检查尿意
Bladder check.

404
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,634
可以开始了
We're good to go.

405
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,869
准备好了?
You ready?

406
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:14,937
是的
Yes.

407
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,106
开始
And begin.

408
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,224
感觉有点诡异
This is kind of creepy.

409
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:37,059
这部分不该说话的
We're not supposed to talk during this part.

410
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,795
抱歉
Sorry.

411
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:48,504
感觉是有点诡异
This is kind of creepy.

412
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:50,272
要停下来吗?
Do you want to stop?

413
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:52,174
我知道你不习惯与人对视
I know you have trouble with eye contact.

414
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,578
你左边的虹膜里
Well, you have a brown fleck

415
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,813
有个褐斑 看起来像是辆
in your right iris that looks

416
00:16:57,815 --> 00:17:01,350
F1赛车
like a Formula One race car.

417
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:05,388
于是... 我盯着那就好了
So... I'm just concentrating on that.

418
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,958
再就是 盯着我习惯的人会简单点
Plus, it's easier around people that I'm comfortable with.

419
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,628
嗷 小甜心 我也很习惯跟你待一起
Aw, sweetie, I'm comfortable around you, too.

420
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,398
那是自然 我又暖又安心
Of course you are, I'm warm and soothing.

421
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:19,969
整个人就像碗番茄汤
I'm like a human bowl of tomato soup.

422
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:23,005
我是说像个小弟弟
I meant more like a little brother.

423
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,041
哦
Oh.

424
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:28,110
我觉得我是有点把你当姐姐了
Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister.

425
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,615
甚至有时候 当妈妈
And sometimes, a mother.

426
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,717
感觉又惊悚起来了
It's getting creepy again.

427
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:43,959
怎么了?
What?

428
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,961
我只是在想
Just thinking about the day

429
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:47,329
遇见你和Leonard的那天
I met you and Leonard.

430
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,098
那是在一个周一午后
It was a Monday afternoon.

431
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,368
你跟我们一起吃印度餐
You joined us for Indian food.

432
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,703
你能相信已经整整过了八年了吗?
Can you believe it's been eight years?

433
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,807
是啊 你还在这里蹭吃
Yeah, and you're still eating our food.

434
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:02,578
我... 想不起哪刻
I... can't remember a time

435
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,314
你们几个没在我身边
you guys weren't in my life.

436
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,983
我可记得很清
I remember it perfectly.

437
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,554
但我有过人的记忆力
But I have an eidetic memory.

438
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,090
你感兴趣的话 我还记得
If you're interested, I also remember

439
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:17,026
你蹭了我们多少吃的
how much you owe us for the food.

440
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:23,199
完事
That's it.

441
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,467
也不怎么难嘛
That wasn't so bad.

442
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,668
确实不难
No, it wasn't.

443
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,336
现在来统计下
Uh, now let's tabulate

444
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,637
实验结果吧
the results of the experiment.

445
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:30,339
好的
Okay.

446
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:34,343
我觉得可以肯定的是 你没爱上我
I think it's safe to say that you're not in love with me

447
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,245
我也没爱上你
and I'm not in love with you.

448
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,881
还有心理学再次
And psychology has once again

449
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:42,718
证明了自己是科学里最没用的
proved itself the doofus of the sciences.

450
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,087
或许是吧
Well, maybe.

451
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,022
但我还是很高兴做了测试
But I'm still glad we did it.

452
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:49,558
我是感觉与你更亲近了
I do feel closer to you.

453
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,528
我也你
And I, you.

454
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,664
没错 话就是这么说的
And yes, that's how you say that.

455
00:18:57,401 --> 00:19:00,803
对了 基于我们新建立的亲密关系
Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy,

456
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,371
我觉得我们
I'd say we have

457
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:03,873
得做几个艰难的抉择
some hard choices to make.

458
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,974
比如什么?
Like what?

459
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:08,344
Gary展... 是坐飞机去还是开车去?
Gary Con... do we fly or drive?

460
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:09,745
要cos吗?
Do we wear costumes?

461
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,947
要的话...
And if so...

462
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:14,884
谁来扮Gary?
