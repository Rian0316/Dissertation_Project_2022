A couple of them specifically wanted photographs of you two.

166
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,120
老天
God's sake!

167
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,650
约翰
John.

168
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,010
遮住脸  快走
Cover your face and walk fast.

169
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,610
这有助于营造良好公众形象
Still, it's good for the public image,

170
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,190
毕竟是这样的大案子
big case like this.

171
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,910
我是私家侦探  公众形象毫无益处
I'm a private detective, the last thing I need is a public image.

172
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,180
帽子侠和罗宾:网络侦探二人组

173
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,830
夏洛克和网络技术

Hello.

177
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,100
我想是时候了  你说呢
I think it's time, don't you?

178
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,850
天啊
Oh, dear!

179
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,130
手指
Thumbs!?

180
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,480
大门...
The door was...

181
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,160
大门...
The door was...

182
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,120
小伙子们  有新客户了
Boys! You've got another one!

183
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,120
从头说  别让我觉得无聊
Tell us from the start, don't be boring.

184
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,420
14小时前

185
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,810
喂
Hey!

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,710
你好
Excuse me!

188
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,570
你没事吧
Are you all right?

189
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,970
长官  您的电话
Sir, phone call for you.

190
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,830
我是卡特
Carter.

191
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,970
- 听说过夏洛克・福尔摩斯吗  - 谁
- Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?  - Who?

192
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,510
你很快就会见到他
Well, you're about to meet him now.

193
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,570
这是你的案子  你说了算  我只是
This is your case, it's entirely up to you, this is just...

194
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,170
给你提个友好建议
friendly advice, but

195
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,960
让夏洛克在犯罪现场调查五分钟
give Sherlock five minutes on your crime scene,

196
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,360
他怎么说你都听着
and listen to everything that he has to say.

197
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,300
还有尽量...
And as far as possible...

198
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,010
不要揍他
try not to punch him.

199
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,140
好的
Ok.

200
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,430
长官  这位先生说
Sir, this gentleman says

201
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,470
- 他要跟您谈谈  - 我知道
- he needs to speak to you...  - Yes, I know.

202
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,820
夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes.

203
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,740
约翰・华生  这里能无线上网吗
John Watson. Are you set up for Wi- Fi?

204
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,510
你也知道这有点丢人吧
You realise this is a tiny bit humiliating?

205
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,570
还好  无所谓  
It's OK, I'm fine.

206
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,290
现在
Now...

207
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,880
让我看看河边
show me to the stream.

208
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,530
我不是说丢你的人
I didn't really mean for you.

209
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,130
听着  这才第六起
Look, this is a six.

210
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,290
第七起之前我离开公寓去勘察毫无意义
There's no point in my leaving the flat for anything

211
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,800
我们已经达成共识了
less than a seven, we agreed.

212
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,050
现在往后退
Now go back,

213
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,440
让我看草地
show me the grass.

214
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
我们什么时候达成的共识
When did we agree that?

215
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
昨天  停
We agreed it yesterday. Stop!

216
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,410
- 近点  - 我昨天根本不在家  
- Closer.  - I wasn't even at home yesterday.

217
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,440
我去了都柏林
I was in Dublin.

218
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,290
你没听见是你的问题  
It's hardly my fault you weren't listening.

219
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,980
- 闭嘴  - 我不在家你还一个人叨叨
- Shut up!  - Do you just carry on talking when I'm away?

220
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,900
谁知道你什么时候不在家
I don't know, how often are you away?

221
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,940
现在
Now...

222
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,250
让我看看排气管回火那车
show me the car that backfired.

223
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,340
在那边
It's there.

224
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,220
就是这辆车发出巨响的吧
That's the one that made the noise, yes?

225
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,320
对
Yeah.

226
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,300
如果你在考虑枪击...
If you're thinking gunshot...

227
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,390
没有枪击
There wasn't one.

228
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,890
他没有中弹
He wasn't shot,

229
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,320
致命伤是
he was killed by a single

230
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,740
背后一处钝器重击
blow to the back from a blunt instrument,

231
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,330
但凶器和凶手一起神秘消失了
which then magically disappeared, along with the killer.

232
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,080
我看这次至少得有八起案子
It's got to be an eight, at least.

233
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
你还有两分钟
You've got two more minutes,

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,900
他们想知道更多司机的信息
they want to know more about the driver.

235
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,040
不用管他  他是个白痴
Oh, forget him, he's an idiot.

236
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,400
他怎么会认为自己是疑犯
Why else would he think himself a suspect?

237
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,450
是我认为他有嫌疑
I think he's a suspect.

238
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,040
- 把电脑递过去  - 好吧
- Pass me over.  - All right,

239
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,720
要是有静音按钮  我巴不得马上按掉
but there's a mute button, and I will use it.

240
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,100
举高点  我才不要在下面说话
Up a bit! I'm not talking from down here!

241
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,830
好吧  你举着  举着吧
OK. Just take it, take it.

242
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,240
成功谋杀且没有证人
Having successfully committed a crime without a single witness...

243
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,180
他何必又叫警察又找侦探
why would he call the police and consult a detective?

244
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,520
- 想跟你公平竞赛  - 他在耍小聪明
- Fair play?  - He's trying to be clever.

245
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,330
他是过于自负了
It's overconfidence.

246
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,710
你见过他吗
Did you see him?

247
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,070
过度肥胖
Morbidly obese,

248
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,370
口臭熏天证明是单身汉
the undisguised halitosis of a single man living on his own.

249
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,130
右袖子证明他沉迷于色情网站
The right sleeve of an internet porn addict,

250
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,430
呼吸模式证明他是未治疗的心脏病患者
the breathing pattern of an untreated heart condition.

251
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,050
自尊低  智商低  命不长久
Low self- esteem, tiny IQ and a limited life expectancy,

252
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,960
你居然认为他能策划罪案
and you think he's a criminal mastermind?!

253
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,480
别担心  这推论傻疯了
Don't worry, this is just stupid.

254
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,650
你说什么  我心脏怎么了
What did you say? Heart what?

255
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,270
去河边
Go to the stream.

256
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,590
河里有什么
What's in the stream?

257
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,590
- 过去看看  - 夏洛克
- Go and see.  - Sherlock!

258
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,840
你怎么不应门
You weren't answering your doorbell.

259
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,600
他的卧室在后面  去拿些衣服
His room's through the back, get him some clothes.

260
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,470
你们到底是什么人  
Who the hell are you?

261
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,010
抱歉  福尔摩斯先生...
Sorry, Mr Holmes...

262
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,680
- 夏洛克  怎么了  - 您得跟我们走 
- Sherlock, what's going on? What's happening?  - You're coming with us.

263
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,380
信号断了  不知怎么...
I've lost him. I don't know what...

264
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,870
- 华生医生  - 我是
- Dr Watson?  - Yeah.

265
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,240
- 找您的  - 好  谢谢
- It's for you.  - OK, thanks.

266
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,300
不  先生  是直升机
No, sir, the helicopter.

267
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,640
福尔摩斯先生  您要去的那个地方
Please, Mr Holmes, where you're going

268
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,200
您一定会希望着装得体
you'll want to be dressed.

269
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,860
西装：

270
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,860
700镑

271
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,870
无武器

272
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,790
修剪

273
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:27,790
整齐

274
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,190
坐办公室

275
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,430
惯用右手

276
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,730
室内工作

277
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,780
小狗

278
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,730
x2

279
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,780
x3

280
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,090
我很清楚我要去哪儿
I know exactly where I'm going.

281
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,950
- 你穿了裤子吗  - 没有  - 好吧
- You wearing any pants? - No. - OK.

282
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,940
我们在白金汉宫哎  很好
At Buckingham Palace. Right.

283
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,280
我在努力克制偷烟灰缸的冲动
Aah, aah, I am seriously fighting an impulse to steal an ashtray.

284
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,210
我们来这里做什么
What are we doing here,

285
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,750
- 夏洛克  正经回答我  - 我不知道
- Sherlock, seriously, what? - I don't know.

286
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,520
是来谒见女王吗
Here to see the Queen?

287
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,980
很显然  你说对了
Oh, apparently, yes.

288
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,390
拜托你们一回  别这么幼稚好吗
Just once, can you two behave like grown- ups?

289
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,120
我们破案  我用博客记录  他忘了穿裤子
We solve crimes, I blog about it, and he forgets his pants.

290
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,460
我对此不抱太大希望
I wouldn't hold out too much hope.

291
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,160
麦考夫  我手头还有案子
I was in the middle of a case, mycroft.

292
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,220
什么案子  驴友和发动机回火事件
What, the hiker and the backfire?

293
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,510
我过了一眼警方报告  有点平淡无奇了吧
I glanced at the police report, a bit obvious, surely?

294
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,370
- 显而易见  - 那就别操心了
- Transparent. - Time to move on then.

295
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,970
这里是白金汉宫
We are in Buckingham Palace,

296
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,270
整个英国的中枢之地
the very heart of the British nation.

297
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,130
- 夏洛克・福尔摩斯  穿上裤子  - 为啥
- Sherlock Holmes, put your trousers on! - What for?

298
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,470
为了客户
Your client.

299
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,180
我的这位客户...
And my client is...?

300
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,700
地位显赫  尊荣至极
Illustrious, in the extreme.

301
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,830
所以我必须说明  客户的名字保密
And remaining, I have to inform you, entirely anonymous.

302
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,530
- 麦考夫  - 哈瑞
- Mycroft. - Harry.

303
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,310
舍弟礼数不周  请允许我
May I just apologise for the state

304
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,340
- 代他道歉  - 我想是他太忙了吧
- of my little brother. - A full- time occupation, I imagine.

305
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,760
这位一定是约翰・华生医生
And this must be Dr John Watson,

306
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,270
曾在第五诺森伯兰兵团服役
formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers?

307
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,210
正是  你好
Hello, yes.

308
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,140
- 我老板非常喜欢你的博客  - 你老板
- My employer is a tremendous fan of your blog. - Your employer?

309
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,280
尤其喜欢写铝拐杖的那一篇
Particularly enjoyed the one about the aluminium crutch.

310
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,210
谢谢
Thank you.

311
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,000
这位年轻的福尔摩斯先生
And Mr Holmes the Younger.

312
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,890
你没有照片上那么高
You look taller in your photographs.

313
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,660
多亏那件修身外套和这位矮个子朋友
I take the precaution of a good coat and a short friend.

314
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,620
麦考夫  我不接匿名客户
Mycroft, I don't do anonymous clients.

315
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,390
我习惯了案子一头是谜
I'm used to mystery at one end of my cases,

316
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,920
两头都是谜就太麻烦了  再见
both ends is too much work. Good morning.

317
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,770
此案事关国家  别闹了
This is a matter of national importance. Grow up!

318
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,970
- 松开我的床单  - 不然呢
- Get off my sheet! - Or what?

319
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,440
不然我就直接走出去
Or I'll just walk away.

320
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,970
- 那我成全你  - 两位  注意场合
- I'll let you. - Boys, please...not here.

321
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,640
这位客户到底是谁
Who is my client?

322
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,240
看看你在什么地方  然后动脑筋想想
Take a look at where you're standing, and make a deduction.

323
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,030
雇你的是全国最有权势的人  还要点明吗
You are to be engaged by the highest in the land, now, for God's sake!

324
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,120
快把衣服穿上
Put your clothes on!

325
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,740
我负责招呼
I'll be mother.

326
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,710
我从小到大就是听你招呼
And there is a whole childhood in a nutshell.

327
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,460
我老板遇到了棘手的问题
My employer has a problem.

328
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,260
这件事极其敏感  存在犯罪的可能性
A matter has come to light of an extremely delicate

329
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,700
如今面临曝光的危险
and potentially criminal nature,

330
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,560
在此紧急关头
and in this hour of need,

331
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,700
- 亲爱的弟弟  有人想到了你  - 为什么
- dear brother, your name has arisen. - Why?

332
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,980
我们有各种各样的警力
We have a police force of sorts,

333
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,470
还有无孔不入的军情六处
even a marginally secret service.

334
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,590
- 为什么来找我  - 大家都找你帮忙
- Why come to me? - People come to you for help,

335
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,800
对吧  福尔摩斯先生
don't they, Mr Holmes?

336
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,410
但名下有海军的人可没找过我
Not to date anyone with a navy.

337
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,740
此案关系到最高机密  以及信任问题
This is a matter of the highest security, and therefore of trust.

338
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,660
- 连自家的情报机关也信不过  - 当然
- You don't trust your own secret service? - Naturally not.

339
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,720
他们都为了钱监视别人
They all spy on people for money.

340
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,790
我们时间有限
I do think we have a timetable.

341
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,140
是的  当然了
Yes, of course. Erm...

342
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,030
你认识这个女人吗
What do you know about this woman?

343
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,960
没印象
Nothing whatsoever.

344
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,750
那你就要多加注意了
Then you should be paying more attention.

345
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,030
她去年成为两起政党丑闻的焦点
She's been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year,

346
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,430
最近又与某著名作家离婚
and recently ended the marriage of a prominent novelist

347
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,360
我送你一份礼物

348
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,950
因为她不仅给老公带绿帽子  还脚踏两条船
by having an affair with both participants separately.

349
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,490
你知道我对花边新闻不感兴趣
You know I don't concern myself with trivia.

350
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,700
她是谁
Who is she?

00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,450
艾琳・阿德勒
Irene Adler.

352
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,820
业内称她为"那个女人"
Professionally known as "The Woman".

353
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,740
业内
Professionally?

354
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,240
她有很多外号  她最喜欢"施虐女王"
There are many names for what she does. She prefers "Dominatrix".

355
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,720
读取图片>>

356
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,160
- 施虐女王  - 别紧张
- Dominatrix. - Don't be alarmed.

357
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,380
是性方面的
It's to do with sex.

358
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,040
性不会让我紧张
Sex doesn't alarm me.

359
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,310
你怎么知道
How would you know?

360
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,510
她提供的是  这样说吧  愉悦的惩罚
She provides, shall we say, recreational scolding

361
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,100
给那些有此嗜好
for those who enjoy that sort of thing

362
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,140
且乐意付钱的人
and are prepared to pay for it.

363
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,130
这些是从她的网站下载的
These are all from her website.

364
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,460
我猜这位阿德勒女士有一些不能见光的照片
And I assume this Adler woman has some compromising photographs.

365
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,190
你反应很快  福尔摩斯先生
You're very quick, Mr Holmes.

366
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,710
不难推断  到底是谁的照片
Hardly a difficult deduction. Photographs of whom?

367
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,070
一个对我老板很重要的人
A person of significance to my employer.

368
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,460
希望我们不要再谈这方面的事了
We'd prefer not to say any more at this time.

369
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,290
你们什么都不说吗
You can't tell us anything?

370
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,970
我可以告诉你们  是个年轻人
I can tell you it's a young person.

371
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,750
一位年轻女性
A young female person.

372
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,300
照片有多少张
How many photographs?

373
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,430
很显然  数量非常大
A considerable number, apparently.

374
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,980
阿德勒小姐和这位年轻女性
Do Miss Adler and this young female

375
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,640
- 同时出现在照片里  - 是的
- person appear in these photographs together? - Yes.

376
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
我猜照片上有许多不能见光的场景
I assume in a number of compromising scenarios?

377
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,300
照我们的想象  这是肯定的
An imaginative range, we are assured.

378
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,420
约翰  你现在最好把茶杯放下
John, you might want to put that cup back in your saucer now.

379
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,740
- 你能帮忙吗  福尔摩斯先生  - 怎么帮
- Can you help us, Mr Holmes? - How?

380
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,200
愿意接这个案子吗
Will you take the case?

381
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,120
什么案子
What case?

382
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,920
立刻给钱  要多少给多少
Pay her, now and in full.

383
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,180
等阿德勒小姐公布照片
As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead,

384
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,590
你们就能领教她的厉害了
know when you are beaten.

385
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,610
她什么都不要
She doesn't want anything.

386
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,640
她联系过我们
She got in touch.

387
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,230
她通知我们说她有那些照片
She informed us that the photographs existed.

明确表示没打算使用这些照片
She indicated that she had no intention to use them

389
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,910
敲诈钱财或是别的什么
to extort either money or favour.

390
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,300
炫耀力量
Oh, a power play.

391
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,030
向大英最有权势的家族炫耀力量
A power play with the most powerful family in Britain.

392
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,360
不愧是施虐女王
Now that is a dominatrix.

393
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,590
这就很有趣了嘛  对吧
Ooh, this is getting rather fun, isn't it.

394
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,630
- 夏洛克  - 她在哪里
- Sherlock... - Hmm. Where is she?

395
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,460
她目前在伦敦  她在...

你确定到时候能搞到消息吗
Do you really think you'll have news by then?

398
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,110
不  我到时候能搞到照片
No, I think I'll have the photographs.

399
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,720
但愿你真像说的那么神奇
One can only hope you're as good as you seem to think.

400
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,700
爱狗

401
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,580

早起

404
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:44,580
睡左边

405
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,000
不抽烟

406
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,000

书迷

409
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,000
嗜茶

410
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,950
当然了  我还需要一样东西
I'll need some equipment, of course.

411
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,340
要什么都行  我会派人送到...
Anything you require, I'll have it sent...

412
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,680
- 能给我一盒火柴吗  - 你说什么
- Can I have a box of matches? - I'm sorry?

413
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,720
或者是打火机  都可以
Or your cigarette lighter, either will do.

414
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,650
- 我不抽烟  - 这我知道  但你老板抽烟
- I don't smoke. - No, I know you don't, but your employer does.

415
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,280
这件小事我们一直对外隐瞒着
We have kept a lot of people successfully in the dark

416
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,190
大多数人都不知道  福尔摩斯先生
about this little fact, Mr Holmes.

417
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,980
我不是大多数
I'm not the Commonwealth.

418
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,280
他这样算是谦虚了
And that's as modest as he gets.

419
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,470
很高兴见到你
Pleasure to meet you.

420
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,660
回见
Laters!

421
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,510
好吧  你怎么知道抽烟的事
OK, the smoking, how did you know?

422
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,430
证据就在你眼皮底下  约翰
The evidence was right under your nose, John,

423
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,760
你看见了  却没有注意到
as ever you see, but do not observe.

424
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,510
- 注意到什么  - 烟灰缸
- Observe what? - The ashtray.

425
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,330
凯特
Kate?

426
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,480
有客人来了
We're going to have a visitor.

427
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,000
我要花点时间准备一下
I'll need a bit of time to get ready.

428
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,920
要很久吗
A long time?

429
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,910
很久很久
Hmm...ages.

430
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,290
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

431
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,740
我要上战场了  约翰
I'm going to into battle, John.

432
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,590
得换一身好盔甲
I need the right armour.

433
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,340
不好
No.

434
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,680
不好
Nah.

435
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,110
我看很好
Works for me.

436
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,150
你看什么都好
Everything works on you.

437
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,490
计划是什么
So, what's the plan?

438
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,620
我们知道她的地址
We know her address.

439
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,390
直接按她家门铃吗
We just ring her doorbell?

440
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,510
没错  就在这儿停
Exactly. Just here, please.

441
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,290
你根本就没有换衣服
You didn't even change your clothes.

442
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,760
所以该添点儿颜色了
Then it's time to add a splash of colour.

443
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,060
到了吗
Are we here?

444
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,090
还有两条街  但就在这儿做吧
Two streets away, but this will do.

445
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,690
- 做什么  - 朝我的脸来一拳
- For what? - Punch me in the face.

446
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,710
什么颜色
Shade?

447
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,460
血红
Blood.

448
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,130
- 打你  - 没错  打我的脸  没听见吗
- Punch you? - Yes, punch me, in the face. Didn't you hear me?

449
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,130
经常听你说"揍我"  不过一般都是潜台词
I always hear "Punch me" when you speak but it's usually sub- text.

450
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,700
真是婆婆妈妈
Oh, for God's sakes!

451
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,560
谢了  这样就...
Thank you, that was...

452
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,810
行了  我们打完了  约翰
OK, I think we're done now, John!

453
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,280
你记清楚  夏洛克  我当过兵  杀过人
You want to remember, Sherlock, I was a soldier. I killed people.

454
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,860
- 你是军医  - 我也有心情不好的时候
- You were a doctor! - I had bad days!

455
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,970
你打算穿什么
What are you going to wear?

456
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,640
- 招牌战衣  - 幸运的家伙
- My battle dress. - Oh, lucky boy.

457
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,590
你好
Hello?

458
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,290
很抱歉打搅你
Oh, very sorry to disturb you,

459
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,930
刚才有人打了我
um, I've just been attacked, um,

460
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,030
他们好像拿走了我的钱包
um, and I think they, they took my wallet

461
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,930
还有手机
and, um, and my phone.

462
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,160
你能帮帮我吗
Um, please could you help me?

463
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,260
需要的话  我可以帮你报警
I can phone the police, if you want?

464
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,740
谢谢  请帮我报警
Thank you. Could you, please?

465
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,690
我就在这儿等他们来  你不介意吧
Would you mind if I just waited here, just until they come?

466
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,670
谢谢你  万分感谢
Thank you, thank you so much.

467
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,880
谢谢
Thank you. Oh.

468
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,080
我当时在场
I saw it all happen.

469
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,100
没关系  我是医生
It's OK, I'm a doctor.

470
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,450
- 你有急救箱吗  - 在厨房里  请便
- Have you got a first aid kit? - In the kitchen. Please.

471
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,780
- 谢谢  - 谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

472
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,960
好可怜  听说你受伤了
Hello, sorry to hear you've been hurt.

473
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,010
- 凯特还没问过你的名字吧  - 抱歉  我
- I don't think Kate caught your name? - I'm so sorry, I'm...

474
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,900
人在大吃一惊的时候
It's always hard to remember an alias

475
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,490
很难想起编好的化名  对吧
when you've had a fright. Isn't it?

476
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,820
瞧啊
Well, there now.

477
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,970
我们都暴露了
We're both defrocked...

478
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,280
夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生
..Mr Sherlock Holmes.

479
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,600
- 你是艾琳・阿德勒吧  - 瞧瞧这对颧骨
- Miss Adler, I presume. - Look at those cheekbones.

480
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,180
要是一巴掌扇过去我会割到手
I could cut myself slapping that face.

481
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,220
要不要我来试试
Would you like me to try?

482
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,840
好了  这就行了
Right, this should do it.

483
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,830
看来我错过了一场好戏
I've missed something, haven't I?

484
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,620
请坐  想喝茶的话  我叫女仆送来
Please, sit down. Or if you'd like some tea, I can call the maid.

485
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,710
我在宫里喝过了
I had some at the Palace.

486
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,590
- 我知道  - 很显然
- I know. - Clearly.

487
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,390
我也在宫里喝过茶了  如果有人要问的话
I had a tea too, at the Palace. If anyone's interested.

488
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,450
两天没换的衬衫

489
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,650
手动剃须

490
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,420
今晚有约会

491
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,120
没给姐姐打电话

492
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,000
新牙刷

493
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,910
夜不归宿

494
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,910
和史丹佛
一起

495
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,020
你知道伪装的最大问题吗  福尔摩斯先生
Do you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr Holmes?

496
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,900
无论你多么努力  总是一幅自画像
However hard you try, it's always a self- portrait.

497
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,500
你觉得我是头破血流的牧师
You think I'm a vicar with a bleeding face?

498
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,850
不  我觉得你神志不清
No, I think you're damaged,

499
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,460
沉溺幻想  坚持无上的权威
delusional and believe in a higher power.

500
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,230
而你的权威  便是你自己
In your case, it's yourself.

501
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,470
有人很爱惜你嘛
Hmm, and somebody loves you.

502
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,500
如果要我打你的脸  我也会避开鼻子和牙齿
If I had to punch that face, I'd avoid your nose and teeth, too.

503
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,130
哈哈  你能别这样光着身子吗
Ha- ha! Could you put something on, please?

504
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,140
- 拿纸巾遮一遮吧  - 怎么  你很尴尬
- Er, anything at all. A napkin? - Why? Are you feeling exposed?

505
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,850
我认为约翰并不知道该看哪
I don't think John knows where to look.

506
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,860
不会  他很清楚该看哪
No, I think he knows exactly where.

507
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,770
倒是你  我不敢肯定
I'm not sure about you.

508
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,600
我要是想看女人的裸体  就借约翰的手提
If I was to look at naked women, I'd borrow John's laptop.

509
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,870
- 你确实借了我的手提  - 那是没收
- You do borrow my laptop. - I confiscate it.

510
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,110
算了  我们还有正经事要谈
Never mind, we've got better things to talk about.

511
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,900
现在  坦白告诉我
Now, tell me, I need to know - 

512
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,930
案子的经过如何
how was it done?

513
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,960
什么案子
What?

514
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,540
脑袋挨了一下的驴友  他怎么死的
The hiker with the bashed- in head - how was he killed?

515
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,830
我来不是为了这件事
That's not why I'm here.

516
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,720
当然不是  你的目标是拿走照片
No, no, no. You're here for the photographs,

517
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,380
但我不会让你拿到  所以不如我们随便聊聊
but that's never going to happen and as we're chatting...anyway

518
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,670
那个案子没有公开  你怎么知道
That story's not out. How do you know about it?

519
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,300
我认识一位警察  我知道他的癖好
I know one of the policemen. Well, I know what he likes.

520
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,170
你喜欢警察
And you...like policemen?

521
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,680
我喜欢侦探故事  还有侦探
I like detective stories. And detectives.

522
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,850
脑袋好使的人很性感
Brainy is the new sexy.

523
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,110
车位置
The position car...

524
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,440
车的位置与驴友有关系
The position of the car relative to the hiker,

525
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,250
还有那致命一击
that and the fact that the death blow

526
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,360
来自他的脑后  你知道这些就够了
was to the back of the head, that's all you need to know.

527
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,450
- 好吧  告诉我他怎么被杀  - 不是被杀
- OK, tell me, how was he murdered? - He wasn't.

528
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,900
你觉得不是凶杀吗
You don't think it was murder?

529
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,490
- 我知道不是  - 怎么知道
- I know it wasn't. - How?

530
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,720
就像我知道死者是位出色的冒险家
The same way that I know the victim was a excellent sportsman,

531
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,020
刚从海外旅行归来
recently returned from foreign travel

532
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,750
而我要找的照片就在这个房间里
and that the photographs I'm looking for are in this room.

533
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,460
- 好吧  可怎么知道  - 这么说还真在  谢谢
- OK, but how? - So they are in this room. Thank you.

534
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,470
约翰  把守房门  别让人进来
John, man the door, let no- one in.

535
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,740
乡村野外  只有两个男人
Two men alone in the countryside,

536
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,500
相隔几码远  还有一辆车
several yards apart and one car.

537
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,190
我以为你要开始找照片了
Oh, I... I thought you were looking for the photos now.

538
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,780
不  不
No, no.

539
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,140
找要花上好久  我能直接找到
Looking takes ages, I'm just going to find them,

540
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,650
不过你还算聪明  我们又有时间
but you're moderate clever and we've got a moment,

541
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,180
所以我们消遣一下吧
so let's pass the time.

542
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,370
两个人  一辆车  没有其他人了
Two men, a car, nobody else.

543
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,290
司机想要修好他的发动机
Driver's trying to fix his engine.

544
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,390
毫无进展
Getting nowhere.

545
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,780
而驴友正在休息  望着天空
And the hiker is taking a moment, looking at the sky.

546
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,590
是在看鸟吗
Watching the birds?

547
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,590
随时都会有事要发生  什么事
Any moment now, something is going to happen. What?

548
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,390
- 驴友要死了  - 不对
- The hiker is going to die. - No,

549
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,520
那是结果  要发生什么事
that's the result. What's going to happen?

550
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,780
- 我不懂  - 试着去理解吧
- I don't understand. - Oh, well try to.

551
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,450
- 为什么  - 因为你迎合衰人的幻想
- Why? - Because you cater to the whims of the pathetic

552
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,420
脱得精光只为了让人印象深刻
and take your clothes off to make an impression.

553
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,010
别让我无聊  开动脑筋吧  这是时下流行的性感
Stop boring me and think. It's the new sexy.

554
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,910
车要回火了
The car's going to backfire.

555
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,530
会发出很大的响声
There's going to be a loud noise.

556
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,970
- 那又如何  - 声音很重要
- So what? - Oh. Noises are important.

557
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,640
声音会告诉你一切  比如...
Noises can tell you everything. For instance...

558
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,680
谢谢
Thank you.

559
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,440
听到火警警报  母亲会向孩子的方向望去
On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look towards her child.

560
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,570
大火能暴露我们最在意的东西  真神奇
Amazing how fire exposes our priorities.

561
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,310
我真心希望这里面没有小孩子
I really hope you don't have a baby in here.

562
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,820
好了  约翰  你可以把警报关掉了
All right, John, you can turn it off now.

563
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,220
我说你可以关掉了
I said you can turn it off now!

564
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,510
稍等
Give me a minute!

565
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,140
多谢
Thank you.

566
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,190
按键的时候要记得戴手套
You should always use gloves with these things, you know.

567
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,150
最先按到的键上的油渍总是最重
Heaviest oil deposit is always on the first key used,

568
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,130
显然就是3了
that's quite clear the 3,

569
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,440
但这之后的按键顺序几乎看不出来
but after that, the sequence is almost impossible to read.

570
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,500
这样的保险箱应该是六位密码
I see it's a six digit code.

571
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,130
不可能是你的生日  无意冒犯
Can't be your birthday, no disrespect,

572
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,480
但你显然是个八零后  而8几乎没用到
but clearly you were born in the '80s and 8's barely used, so...

573
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,260
我现在就能告诉你密码
I'd tell you the code right now,

574
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,780
但其实呢  我已经告诉你了
but you know what? I already have.

575
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,460
开动脑筋吧
Think.

576
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,810
手放在脑后  跪在地上  别动
Hands behind your head, on the floor, keep it still!

577
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,820
抱歉  夏洛克
Sorry, Sherlock.

578
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,250
阿德勒小姐  跪在地上
Miss Adler, on the floor!

579
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,290
你不要我也跪在地上吗
Don't you want me on the floor,too?

580
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,380
不  先生  我要你打开保险箱
No, sir, I want you to open the safe.

581
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,370
美国人  有意思  你们怎么会感兴趣
American. Interesting. Why would you care?

582
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:41,010
- 先生  立刻打开保险箱  - 我不知道密码
- Sir, the safe, now, please. - I don't know the code.

583
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,940
我们一直在监听  她说她告诉你了
We've been listening, she said she told you.

584
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,720
如果你们真的在听  就会知道她没说
Well, if you've been listening, you'll know she didn't.

585
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,670
我想我一定漏了什么
I'm assuming I missed something.

586
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,970
而你这么聪明的人肯定没有漏掉  福尔摩斯先生
From your reputation, I'm assuming you didn't, Mr Holmes.

587
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,630
老天爷  她才是知道密码的人  问她
For God's sake, she's the one who knows the code, ask her!

588
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,590
确实  先生  不过她也知道
Yes, sir, she also knows the code

589
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,570
能自动报警  触响被盗警报的密码
that automatically calls the police and sets off the burglar alarm.

590
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,630
我已经学会不去信任这个女人了
I've learned not to trust this woman.

591
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,040
- 福尔摩斯先生不...  - 闭嘴
- Mr Holmes doesn't... - Shut up!

592
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,540
你再说一个字  一个字
One more word out of you, just one

593
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,790
我就崩得你脑浆涂墙
and I will decorate that wall with the insides of your head.

594
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,570
这对我来说可不是难事
That, for me, will not be a hardship.

595
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,410
- 亚彻先生  数到三  杀了华生医生  - 什么
- Mr Archer, at the count of three, shoot Dr Watson. - What?

596
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,650
我不知道密码
I don't know the code.

597
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,700
- 一  - 我不知道密码
- One.- I don't know the code.

598
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,240
- 二  - 她没告诉我  我不知道
 - Two.- She didn't tell me, I don't know it!

599
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,300
我随时都准备相信你了
I'm prepared to believe you, any second now.

600
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,560
- 三  - 别  住手
- Three! - No, stop!

601
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,790
谢谢你  福尔摩斯先生  请打开
Thank you, Mr Holmes. Open it, please.

602
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,730
好戏上演
Vatican cameos!

603
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,620
- 有劳了  - 好的
- Do you mind? - Not at all.

604
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,860
他死了
He's dead.

605
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:23,740
谢谢
Thank you.

606
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,030
- 你观察力十分敏锐  - 观察力
- You were very observant. - Observant?

607
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,020
- 我受宠若惊  - 不必
- I'm flattered. - Don't be.

608
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,050
- 受宠若惊  - 他们还会有人赶来
- Flattered? - There'll be more of them,

609
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,660
他们肯定有人盯着这栋楼
they'll be keeping an eye on the building.

610
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,270
- 我们该报警  - 对
- We should call the police. - Yes.

611
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,390
- 这就来  - 天呐
- On their way. - For God's sake!

612
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,790
闭嘴  这样快
Oh, shut up, it's quick.

613
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,970
检查房子其他房间  看看他们怎么进来的
Check the rest of the house, see how they got in.

614
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,780
这就是囊中的珍宝了
Well, that's the knighthood in the bag.

615
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,720
那是我的东西
Oh, and that's mine.

616
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,700
手机已锁

617
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,700
请输入密码

618
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,420
我想照片都在这里了吧
All the photographs are on here, I presume?

619
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,090
- 我当然还有副本  - 你没有
- I have copies, of course. - No, you don't.

620
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,490
你肯定彻底解除了任何数据传输功能
You'll have permanently disabled any kind of uplink or connection.

621
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,180
如果不能证明这部电话里的内容独一无二
Unless the contents of this phone prove to be unique,

622
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,680
你也卖不出去
you wouldn't be able to sell them.

623
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,550
谁说我要卖了
Who said I'm selling?

624
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,610
要不他们怎么会感兴趣
Well, why would they be interested?

625
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,350
不管手机里有什么  显然不止是照片那么简单
Whatever's on the phone, it's clearly not just photographs.

626
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,330
那部摄像手机是我的身家性命  福尔摩斯先生
That camera- phone is my life, Mr Holmes.

627
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,580
要我给你除非我死了  它是我的护盾
I'd die before I let you take it. It's my protection.

628
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,030
- 夏洛克  - 现在不是了
- Sherlock! - It was.

629
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,870
- 一定是从这边进来的  - 显然
- Must have come in this way. - Clearly.

630
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,600
没事  她只是昏过去了而已
It's all right, she's just out cold.

631
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,780
天晓得她都习惯了
Oh, God knows she's used to that.

632
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,440
还有个后门  快去检查一下吧  华生医生
There's a back door. Better check it, Dr Watson.

633
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,690
好吧
Sure.

634
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,730
你很冷静
You're very calm.

635
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,680
你的陷阱刚刚杀了个人
Well, your booby trap did just kill a man.

636
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,230
不然他也会杀我
He would have killed me.

637
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,870
那是抢先自卫
It was self defence in advance.

638
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,160
那是什么  是什么
What is that?! What?

639
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,400
给我
Give it to me.

640
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,930
快给我
Now. Give it to me.

641
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,280
不
No.

642
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,190
- 给我  - 不要
- Give it to me. - Argh! No.

643
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,100
天呐
Oh, for goodness sake!

644
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,800
放手
Drop it.

645
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,470
我...说...放手
I...said...drop it!

646
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,790
谢了  亲爱的
Ah, thank you, dear.

647
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,520
好了  去转告那个时髦的小可爱
Now, tell that sweet little posh thing

648
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,490
照片放在我这儿很安全
the pictures are safe with me.

649
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,970
我不会用它们勒索她  只是为了保险
They're not for blackmail, just for insurance.

650
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,100
再说  我可能还想再见见她呢
Besides, I might want to see her again.

651
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,710
不不不  别这样
Oh, no no no no no no no.

652
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,990
很荣幸跟你交手
It's been a pleasure.

653
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,980
别扫兴
Don't spoil it.

654
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,620
我就想你这样记住我
This is how I want you to remember me,

655
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,200
记住我是打败了你的女人
the woman who beat you.

656
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,690
晚安  夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生
Goodnight, Mr Sherlock Holmes.

657
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,600
- 天呐  你做了什么  - 他会睡上几个小时
- Jesus! What are you doing? - He'll sleep for a few hours.

658
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,080
别让他被自己的呕吐物呛死了
Make sure he doesn't choke on his own vomit,

659
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,820
要不尸体会很难看
it makes for a very unattractive corpse.

660
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,790
这是怎么了  你给他下了什么  夏洛克
What's this? What have you given him? Sherlock?

661
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,240
他会没事的
He'll be fine.

662
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,040
我在很多朋友身上都用过
I've used it on loads of my friends.

663
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,460
夏洛克  能听见我说话吗
Sherlock, can you hear me?

664
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,680
要知道  我想错了他
You know, I was wrong about him.

665
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,420
他确实知道该往哪看
He did know where to look.

666
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,080
看什么  你在说什么
For what? What are you talking about?

667
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
我保险箱的密码
The key- code to my safe.

668
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,490
是什么
What was it?

669
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,260
我该告诉他吗
Shall I tell him?

670
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,330
是我的三围
My measurements.

671
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,200
懂了
Got it!

672
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,030
别说话  别起来  我来说
Oh, ssh ssh no, don't get up, I'll do the talking.

673
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,970
车就要回火了  而驴友
So, the car's about to backfire and the hiker,

674
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,970
他正盯着天空看
he's staring at the sky.

675
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,960
你说他可能是在看鸟  但并非如此  是不是
Now, you said he could be watching birds, but he wasn't, was he?

676
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,010
他是在看另一种飞行物
He was watching another kind of flying thing.

677
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,800
汽车回火  驴友回过头去看
The car backfires and the hiker turns to look...

678
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,040
而这正是他犯的大错
..Which was his big mistake.

679
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,340
等司机抬头看的时候
By the time the driver looks up,

680
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,490
驴友已经死了  他没看到杀死他的东西
the hiker is already dead. What he doesn't see is what killed him

681
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,980
因为那东西已经被水冲到下游了
because it's already being washed downstream.

682
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,280
一位经验丰富的冒险家
An accomplished sportsman

683
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,430
刚从海外旅行归来  还带了个...
recently returned from foreign travel with...

684
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,090
飞去来器回来
a boomerang.

685
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,910
你看一眼就明白了
You got that from one look?

686
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,440
绝对是时下流行的性感
Definitely the new sexy.

687
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,820
我...
I...

688
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,210
我...
I...

689
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,330
别说话了
Hush, now.

690
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,340
没事的
It's OK.

691
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,630
我只是来还你的大衣
I'm only returning your coat.

692
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,990
约翰
John?

693
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,290
约翰
John!

694
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,240
- 你没事吧  - 我怎么回来的
- You OK? - How did I get here?

695
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,690
我想你大概记不得了
I don't suppose you remember much,

696
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,180
你一直在胡言乱语
you weren't making a lot of sense.

697
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,700
我该提醒你一声
Oh, I should warn you,

698
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,020
我想雷斯垂德用手机把你拍下来了
I think Lestrade filmed you on his phone.

699
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,070
- 她在哪  - 谁在哪
- Where is she? - Where's who?

700
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,110
- 那个女人  就是那个女人  - 什么女人
- The woman, that woman. - What woman?

701
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,260
- 那个女人  就是那一位  - 艾琳・阿德勒吗
- The Woman! The Woman, woman! - Oh, Irene Adler?

702
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,850
她跑了  没人看见她
She got away, no- one saw her.

703
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,510
她不在这儿  夏洛克
She wasn't here, Sherlock.

704
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,680
你在干什么  别别别  回到床上去
What are you? What? No, no, no. No. Back to bed.

705
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,440
你早上就会没事了  睡吧
You'll be fine in the morning. Just sleep.

706
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,780
我当然会没事  我就是没事  绝对没事
Of course I'll be fine, I am fine. I'm absolutely fine.

707
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,590
是啊  你好得不得了
Yes, you're great.

708
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,170
你需要我的话  我就在隔壁
Now, I'll be next door if you need me.

709
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,650
- 我为什么会需要你  - 不为什么
- Why would I need you? - No reason at all.

710
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,070
下次再见
福尔摩斯先生

711
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,710
照片很安全
The photographs are perfectly safe.

712
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,830
在一个在逃的性工作者手上叫安全
In the hands of a fugitive sex worker?

713
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,590
她并不想勒索谁
She's not interested in blackmail.

714
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:46,290
她只想...得到保护  不知是为何
She wants...protection, for some reason.

715
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,750
我想你应该退出警方
I take it you've stood down the police investigation

716
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,340
对她家枪击案的调查了吧
into the shooting at her house?

717
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,800
她手里有照片
How can we do anything while

718
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,760
我们又能做什么  我们无能为力
she has the photographs? Our hands are tied.

719
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
她肯定喜欢你的措辞
She'd applaud your choice of words.

720
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,790
你看出这是怎么回事了吗
Do you see how this works?

721
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,500
那部摄像手机是她的免牢金牌
That camera- phone is her get out of jail free card.

722
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,750
你们得放过她  像对待皇室那样对她  麦考夫
You have to leave her alone. Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.

723
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,040
可别像她对待皇室那样对她
Though not the way she treats royalty.

724
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,620
那是什么
What was that?

725
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,100
短信
Text.

726
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,850
可那声音是什么
But what was that noise?

727
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,140
你知道还有其他人在盯着她吗  麦考夫
Did you know there were other people after her too, Mycroft,

728
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,450
早上好
福尔摩斯先生

729
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,560
你派我和约翰去之前就知道吗
before you sent John and I in there?

730
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,160
好像是中情局的职业杀手
CIA trained killers, I think.

731
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,020
- 他们真不赖  - 是啊  多谢了  麦考夫
- Excellent gangs. - Yeah, thanks for that, Mycroft.

732
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,320
真不知羞
It's a disgrace,

733
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,040
把你弟弟派去那种龙潭虎穴
sending your little brother into danger like that.

734
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,160
你终究只有家人能依靠  麦考夫・福尔摩斯
Family is all we have in the end, Mycroft Holmes!

735
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,810
- 闭嘴吧  赫德森太太  - 麦考夫
- Oh, shut up, Mrs Hudson! - Mycroft!!

736
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
抱歉
Apologies.

737
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,530
- 谢谢  - 不过你确实该闭嘴了
- Thank you. - Though do in fact shut up.

738
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,320
这声音不太好吧
Oh, it's a bit rude, that noise, isn't it?

739
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,980
感觉好些了吗

740
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,890
你做不了什么
There's nothing you can do

741
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,210
她也不会做什么  至少依我看是如此
and nothing she will do, as far as I can see.

742
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,590
我可以给她设置最高监控级别
I can put maximum surveillance on her.

743
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,730
何必  你盯着推特就能跟踪她的行程
Why bother? You can follow her on Twitter.

744
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,770
我想她的用户名是"登顶女王"
I believe her user name is The Whip Hand.

745
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,090
是啊  真有趣
Yes. Most amusing.

746
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,650
失陪  喂
Excuse me. Hello?

747
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,610
你的手机为什么会发出那种声音
Why does your phone make that noise?

748
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,790
什么声音
What noise?

749
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,170
就是它刚刚发出的那种声音
That noise, the one it just made.

750
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,380
那是短信的铃音  意味着我收到短信了
It's a text alert, means I've got a text.

751
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,670
你的短信一般不会叫床
Your texts don't usually make that noise.

752
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,770
有人拿了我的手机  显然开了个玩笑
Well, somebody got hold of the phone and apparently as a joke,

753
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,430
把短信铃音个性化了
personalised their text alert noise.

754
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,370
那么说你每次收到短信就会...
Hmm, so every time they text you...

755
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,050
看来如此
It would seem so.

756
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,090
你能把手机声音关掉吗  要是我那个年代...
Could you turn that phone down a bit? At my time of life it's...

757
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,900
既然你没问起
我也很好

758
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,290
我在想谁会拿到你的手机
See I'm wondering who could have got hold of your phone.

759
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,340
手机是在你的大衣里  对不对
It would've been in your coat, wouldn't it?

760
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,130
我不打扰你推理了
I'll leave you to your deductions.

761
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,380
要知道  我可不傻
I'm not stupid, you know.

762
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,990
你怎么得出的这个结论
Where do you get that idea?

763
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,000
施行邦德航空计划  已经决定了
Bond Air is go, that's decided.

764
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,430
跟考文垂那边核实一下
Check with the Coventry lot.

765
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,280
回头再谈
Talk later.

766
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,520
她还有什么
What else does she have?

767
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,200
艾琳・阿德勒  美国人不会为了几张敏感照片
Irene Adler. The Americans wouldn't be interested in her

768
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,720
而对她感兴趣
for a couple of compromising photographs.

769
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,380
她还有东西
There's more.

770
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,440
有很多
Much more.

771
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,080
有大事要发生了吧
Something big's coming, isn't it?

772
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,870
艾琳・阿德勒已经与你无关了
Irene Adler is no longer any concern of yours.

773
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,070
从现在起  你不要再插手此事
From now on, you will stay out of this.

774
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,340
- 是吗  - 是的  夏洛克
- Oh, will I? - Yes, Sherlock.

775
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,150
正是如此
You will.

776
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,230
可以的话  恕我失陪
Now if you'll excuse me,

777
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,040
我得去向我多年的老朋友负荆请罪
I have a long and arduous apology to make to a very old friend.

778
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,460
记得代我向她问好
Do give her my love.

779
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,960
拉得太好了  夏洛克  太动听了
Lovely, Sherlock. That was lovely.

780
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,660
- 余音绕梁啊  - 对  太棒了
- Hmm, marvellous. - Yes, very good.

781
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,830
要是戴上圣诞鹿角就更完美了
I wish you could have worn the antlers.

782
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,180
赫德森太太  有些事总要留点想象才完美
Some things are best left to the imagination, Mrs Hudson.

783
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,100
赫德森太太
Mrs Hudson?

784
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,770
- 不用了  谢了  莎拉  - 别理他  他老记错人名
- No thank you, Sarah. - Er, no, no, he's not good with names.

785
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,910
等等  我能记起来
No, I can get this.

786
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,460
莎拉是那个医生  之后换了一脸痘痘的妹子
Sarah was the doctor, then there was the one with the spots,

787
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,460
再之后是一身香味的那个
then the one with the nose and then,

788
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,520
那个闷蛋老师之后是谁来着
who was after the boring teacher?

789
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,860
- 没了  - 你是珍妮特  稍微排除下就出来了
- Nobody. - Jeanette! Ah, process of elimination.

790
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,590
天啊
Oh, dear Lord.

791
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,750
大家好  抱歉来晚了
Hello, everyone. Sorry, hello.

792
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,910
门上写着说直接上来就行了
It said on the door to just come up.

793
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,220
- 茉莉  你好  - 茉莉  你好
- Hello, Molly. - Hello, Molly!

794
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,100
每来一个  就打一次招呼  好一个礼仪之邦
Everybody saying hello to each other, how wonderful!

795
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,900
让我帮你...我的天啊
Let me, er... Holy Mary!

796
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,360
那我们现在要喝圣诞特饮了吗
So we're having Christmas drinkies then?

797
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,470
显然  你要喝  没人拦你
No stopping them, apparently.

798
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,390
一年里头只有今天
It's the one day of the year

799
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,010
这些小鬼会好好地陪陪我
where the boys have to be nice to me,

800
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,880
所以也算值了
so it's almost worth it.

801
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,560
- 约翰  - 啥
- John? - Hmm?

802
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,090
你的博客还是只有1895次点击
The counter on your blog still says 1895.

803
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,900
怎么会  让人圣诞节都没心思过
Oh, no, Christmas is cancelled.

804
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,540
你竟然放了我戴帽子的那张照片
And you've got a photograph of me wearing that hat!

805
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,690
- 大家都爱这张  - 才怪  说谁呢
- People like it. - No, they don't. What people?

806
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,090
- 髋关节怎样了  - 糟透了  谢谢关心
- How's the hip? - Oh, it's atrocious, but thanks for asking.

807
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,460
我见过更糟的  不过之后给我解剖了
I've seen much worse, but then I do post- mortems.

808
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,380
- 瞧我说的  抱歉  - 别说笑话  茉莉
- Oh, God, sorry. - Don't make jokes, Molly.

809
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,890
- 知道  抱歉  - 给你
- No, sorry. - Here you are.

810
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,120
谢谢  没想到你也在
Thank you. I wasn't expecting to see you.

811
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,130
我以为你会在多塞特郡过圣诞
I thought you were in Dorset for Christmas?

812
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,240
今天一大早
The first thing in the morning,

813
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,560
我就和太太重归于好了
me and the wife, back together, sorted.

814
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,480
瞎说  她跟一位体育老师上床了
No, she's sleeping with a PE teacher.

815
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,550
- 约翰  我听说你要去你姐姐家吧  - 对
- And John, I hear you're off to your sister's? Is that right? - Yeah.

816
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,400
夏洛克抱怨过  错  是说过
Sherlock was complaining. Saying.

817
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,080
有史以来她头一回洗心革面  决定戒酒
First time ever, she's cleaned up her act, off the booze.

818
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,700
- 才怪  - 闭嘴  夏洛克
- Nope. - Shut up, Sherlock!

819
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,770
看来你找了个新男友  茉莉
I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly.

820
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,670
- 你对他很认真啊  - 你说什么
- You're serious about him. - Sorry, what?

821
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,500
- 你准备今晚见他  送他礼物  - 消停一天行吗
- You're seeing him tonight, giving him a gift. - Take a day off.

822
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,850
- 住口  喝你的酒  - 你们别扫兴
- Shut up. Have a drink. - Oh, come on.

823
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,900
你们肯定也看到袋子最上面那份礼物了
Surely you all see the present on the top of the bag.

824
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,080
包装精美  还系着蝴蝶结  其余的包装马虎
Perfectly wrapped with a bow. The others are slapdash.

825
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,050
绝对是给特别的人
It's for someone special.

826
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,400
红色包装纸和口红颜色一致
The shade of red echoes her lipstick,

827
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,720
也许是无意挑的
either an unconscious association,

828
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,540
也许是有意用它暗示对方
or one she's deliberately trying to encourage.

829
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,780
不管怎样  霍普小姐坠入爱河了
Either way, Miss Hooper has love on her mind.

830
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,890
显然她非常在乎他
That she's serious about him

831
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,930
从她送给他的礼物可见一斑
is clear from the fact she's giving him a gift at all.

832
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,500
显然这表明她对这段关系渴望已久
That suggests long- time hopes asolutely for long.

833
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,220
从她的妆容和打扮
That she's seeing him tonight

834
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,500
可见她今晚一定会去见他
is evident from her make- up and what she is wearing.

835
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,880
显然是想弥补自己嘴唇和胸部的不丰满
Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts.

836
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,860
致最亲爱的夏洛克
茉莉敬上

837
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,870
你总是这样出口伤人
You always say such horrible things.

838
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:33,770
每次都是  一而再  再而三
Every time. Always. Always.

839
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,580
对不起  原谅我
I am sorry. Forgive me.

840
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,030
圣诞快乐  茉莉・霍普
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.

841
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,790
别误会  那不是我...
Oh, no! That wasn't, I didn't...

842
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,960
- 不是你  是我  - 我的天啊  真的假的
- No, it was me. - My God, really?

843
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,990
- 什么  - 是我的手机
- What? - My phone.

844
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,710
- 第57条  - 你说什么
- Fifty seven? - Sorry, what?

845
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,010
据我所知  那人已经发了57条短信了
Fifty seven of those texts, the ones I've heard.

846
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,400
看壁炉架

847
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,380
原来你一直有在数啊
Thrilling that you've been counting.

848
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,460
失陪一下
Excuse me.

849
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,050
夏洛克  怎么了
What's up, Sherlock?

850
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,400
- 我说了  失陪一下  - 你就不回复一下吗
- I said excuse me. - Do you ever reply?

851
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,520
哇  千年一遇呀
Oh, dear Lord,

852
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,590
该不会是打来祝我圣诞快乐的吧
we're not going to have Christmas phone calls now, are we?

853
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,320
难道我们国家颁布新政策了吗
Have they passed a new law?

854
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,310
我想你们今晚就得去找艾琳・阿德勒
I think you're going to find Irene Adler tonight.

855
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:00,010
我们早就掌握她的行踪了
We already know where she is.

856
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,770
虽然你好意提点  可惜这都跟你没关系了
As you were kind enough to point out, it hardly matters.

857
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:05,270
不  我意思是  你得去找她的尸体
No, I mean you're going to find her dead.

858
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,370
- 你还好吧  - 很好
- You OK? - Yes.

859
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,150
圣巴塞洛缪医院

860
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,790
只有这具尸体符合描述
The only one who fitted the description.

861
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,380
于是把她转来这边  你的第二个家
Had her brought here, your home from home.

862
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,440
茉莉  你没必要也过来
You didn't need to come in, Molly.

863
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,520
没关系  大家都忙着过...圣诞
It's OK, everyone else is busy with... Christmas.

864
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,350
她有点毁容了
The face is a bit sort of bashed- up,

865
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,640
可能有点难以辨认
so it might be a bit difficult.

866
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,540
- 是她本人吧  - 给我看看身体
- That's her, isn't it? - Show me the rest of her.

867
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,080
是她没错
That's her.

868
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,390
谢谢  霍普小姐
Thank you, Miss Hooper.

869
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,320
她是谁
Who is she?

870
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,980
夏洛克为什么光凭身体就认出了她
How did Sherlock recognise her from... not her face?

871
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,830
- 只此一根  - 为什么
- Just the one. - Why?

872
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,320
圣诞快乐嘛
Merry Christmas.

873
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,360
室内抽烟  不是违反了某条...
Smoking indoors, isn't there one of those...

874
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,530
某条法律吗
one of those law things?

875
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,870
这里是停尸房
We're in a morgue.

876
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,280
抽烟也害不了几个人
There's only so much damage you can do.

877
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,170
你怎么知道她死了
How did you know she was dead?

878
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,060
她有一样东西
She had an item in her possession,

879
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,280
她说过下半辈子都靠它了
one she said her life depended on.

880
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,970
- 如今却拱手相让  - 这样东西在哪
- She chose to give it up. - Where is this item now?

881
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,100
你看看他们
Look at them.

882
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,600
投入这么深的感情
They all care so much.

883
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,460
你有没有想过咱俩也许有毛病
Do you ever wonder if there's something wrong with us?

884
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,490
生命都会终结  徒留一颗破碎的心
All lives end, all hearts are broken.

885
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:22,830
爱毫无用处  夏洛克
Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.

886
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:27,310
这是低焦油香烟
This is low tar.

887
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,860
你都不怎么了解她
Well, you barely knew her.

888
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,750
麦考夫  圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.

889
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,220
新年快乐
And a happy new year.

890
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,650
他走了  你有没有什么发现
He's on his way. Have you found anything?

891
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,770
- 没有  他有抽烟吗  - 有
- No. Did he take the cigarette? - Yes.

892
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:58,920
我擦
Shit!

893
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,290
- 他还有十分钟就到  - 卧室里没有发现
- He's coming, ten minutes. - There's nothing in the bedroom.

894
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,170
看来他没藏烟  有可疑的地方我们都翻过了
It looks like he's clean, we've tried all the usual places.

895
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,710
你确定今晚会有危险吗
Are you sure tonight's a danger night?

896
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,560
不确定  不过我向来如此
No, but then I never am.

897
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,370
约翰  你一定要陪着他
You have to stay with him, John.

898
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:11,940
我今晚有别的事
I've got plans.

899
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,720
推了
No.

900
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,880
麦考夫
Mycroft?

901
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,190
真是非常抱歉
I am really sorry.

902
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,350
- 我那些朋友完全看错你了  - 咦
- You know my friends are so wrong about you. - Hmm?

903
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,170
你是个很棒的男朋友
You're a great boyfriend.

904
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,640
嗯  那就好
OK, that's good.

905
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,020
我一向觉得自己不错
I always thought I was great.

906
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,930
所以说夏洛克・福尔摩斯太幸运了
Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man.

907
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,980
珍妮特  别这样
Oh, Jeanette, please.

908
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:43,110
我是说真的  太感人了
No, I mean it. It's heart- warming.

909
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:44,320
你愿意为他做任何事
You'll do anything for him.

910
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,630
而他甚至搞混你的女朋友
And he can't even tell your girlfriends apart!

911
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,990
我也愿意为你做任何事
I'll do anything for you,

912
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,390
你尽管开口  我一定做到  告诉我
just tell me what it is I'm not doing. Tell me!

913
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,090
我不想和夏洛克・福尔摩斯抢男朋友
Don't make me compete with Sherlock Holmes!

914
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,340
我可以帮你遛狗
I'll walk your dog for you.

915
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,100
我说到做到  我会帮你遛狗
There, I've said it, I'll even walk your dog.

916
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,320
- 我根本没养狗  - 哦对  那是前任女友
- I don't have a dog! - No, because that was the last one.

917
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,560
- 抱歉  - 真是难以置信
- OK. - Jesus!

918
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:02,590
- 再联系  - 免了
- I'll call you. - No!

919
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:03,700
好吧
Ok.

920
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,140
看来你俩真的没戏了吧
That really wasn't very good, was it?

921
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,290
回来了呀
Oh, hi.

922
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,630
你没事吧
You OK?

923
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,150
希望你这回没搞乱我的股票指数研究
I hope you didn't mess up my stock index this time!

924
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,800
曲子很美  夏洛克  以前没听你拉过
Lovely tune, Sherlock, haven't heard that one before.

925
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,250
在作曲吗
Composing?

926
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,320
有助于思考
Helps me to think.

927
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,060
你在想些什么呢
What are you thinking about?

928
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,220
你博客上的点击还是只有1895次
The count on your blog is still stuck at 1895.

929
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:25,710
对  出故障了  似乎修不好
Yes. Faulty, can't seem to fix it.

930
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,930
是出故障  还是说博客被黑了  这个数字别有用意
Faulty, or you've been hacked and it's a message.

931
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:36,010

是出故障了
Just faulty.

944
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:41,930
好的
Right.

945
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:46,170
好了
Right.

946
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,420
我要出去一会儿
Well, I'm going out for a bit.

947
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:04,010
那个  他有没有过什么女朋友
Listen, has he ever had any kind of girlfriend,

948
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,800
男朋友或走得近的人
boyfriend, a relationship, ever?

949
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,330
我也不知道
I don't know.

950
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,880
我们怎么会不知道
How can we not know?

951
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,630
他可是夏洛克啊
He's Sherlock.

952
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,700
聪明古怪如他  谁能看透他的想法
How will we ever know what goes on in that funny old head?

953
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,590
说的也是  回见
Right. See you.

954
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,710
- 约翰  - 在  你好
- John? - Yeah? Hello?

955
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,540
- 你好  - 今晚打算怎么过新年
- Hello. - So, any plans for new year tonight?

956
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,650
呃  没什么打算
Um, er... nothing fixed.

957
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,350
没什么非做不可的事
Nothing I couldn't heartlessly abandon.

958
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:53,410
- 你有什么提议  - 有一个
- You have any ideas? - One.

959
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,290
其实  麦考夫只要给我个电话
You know, Mycroft could just phone me,

960
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,180
他就不能别每次都搞得这么神经兮兮
if he didn't have this bloody stupid power complex.

961
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,020
我们就不能找间咖啡厅聊吗
Couldn't we just go to a cafe?

962
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,490
夏洛克也不是一直跟着我
Sherlock doesn't follow me everywhere.

963
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:38,360
请往那边走
Through there.

964
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,310
他马上就到
He's on his way.

965
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,860
你说对了  他以为是麦考夫找他
You were right, he thinks it's Mycroft.

966
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,410
他在谱一首苦情曲
He's writing sad music.

967
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,380
不吃东西  几乎不说话
Doesn't eat, barely talks,

968
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,460
偶尔给电视里的节目纠下错
only to correct the television.

969
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,000
依我看  他是真伤心了  但他可是夏洛克
I'd say he was heart- broken, but, er, well he's Sherlock.

970
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,530
反正伤人心的事他也没少干
He does all that anyway.

971
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:20,080
你好  华生医生
Hello, Dr Watson.

972
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,080
告诉他你还活着
Tell him you're alive.

973
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,110
那他不会放过我
He'd come after me.

974
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,850
如果你不告诉他  我也不会放过你
I'll come after you if you don't.

975
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:35,540
无庸置疑
Hmm, I believe you.

976
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,530
你的尸体在停尸台上
You were dead on a slab.

977
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,190
那绝对是你
It was definitely you.

978
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,730
DNA测试结果跟你们手上的资料一致
DNA tests are only as good as the records you keep.

979
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,460
- 那你肯定认识管资料的人  - 我知道他的癖好
- And I bet you know the record keeper. - I know what he likes.

980
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,260
而我则需要人间蒸发
And I needed to disappear.

981
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,530
那为什么还来找我  而我还不想见你 
Then how come I can see you and I don't even want to?

982
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,250
听着  我犯了个错误
Look, I made a mistake,

983
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,760
我寄了样东西给夏洛克保管  现在我得要回来
I sent something to Sherlock for safekeeping, now I need it back.

984
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,490
- 所以想请你帮忙  - 不行
- So I need your help. - No.

985
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,130
我是为了他的安全着想
It's for his own safety.

986
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,340
我这么做也是  跟他说你还活着
So is this. Tell him you're alive.

987
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:10,410
- 我做不到  - 行  那我来说
- I can't. - Fine, I'll tell him

988
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,860
还有  我不会帮你
and I still won't help you.

989
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,350
我能说什么呢
What do I say?

990
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,420
那你平常都说什么了  你给他发了许多短信
What do you normally say?! You've texted him a lot!

991
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,170
- 只是聊聊罢了  - 你跟他能有什么可聊
- Just the usual stuff. - There is no usual in this case.

992
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,970
早上好  我喜欢你那顶滑稽的帽子
"Good morning. I like your funny hat.

993
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:29,260
我今晚不高兴  一起吃晚饭吧
"I'm sad tonight, let's have dinner.

994
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,670
你在《绳之于法》里的样子真性感  一起吃晚饭吧
"Hmm, you look sexy on Crimewatch, let's have dinner.

995
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,670
《绳之于法》是英国广播公司一档电视节目

996
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,400
我不饿
"I'm not hungry.

997
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,410
一起吃晚饭吧
"Let's have dinner".

998
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:43,080
- 你跟夏洛克・福尔摩斯调情  - 单方面  他从没回过
- You flirted with Sherlock Holmes? - At him. He never replies.

999
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,530
不可能  夏洛克每条短信都回
No, Sherlock always replies to everything.

1000
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:46,830
人称"妙语连珠大师"
He's Mr Punchline.

1001
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,460
他就是憋着一口气不死都要说赢对方
He will outlive God trying to have the last word.

1002
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,480
所以对他而言我很特别吗
Does that make me special?

1003
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,910
- 我不知道  也许是的  - 你吃醋了
- I don't know, maybe. - Are you jealous?

1004
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,040
- 我们又不是一对  - 你们就是
- We're not a couple. - Yes, you are.

1005
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,750
我发了  我没死
There, "I'm not dead.

1006
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,050
我们一起吃饭吧
"Let's have dinner".

1007
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,030
其实又有谁真正了解夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes?

1008
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,750
以免这世上仍有人在乎  我还是声明一下   
But for the record, if anyone out there still cares,

1009
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,020
我可不是同性恋
I'm not actually gay.

1010
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,390
可我是  看看咱们俩
Well, I am. Look at us both.

1011
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,660
不会是我想的那样吧  你觉得呢
I don't think so, do you?

1012
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:43,550
住手
Stop it!

1013
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,430
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1014
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,770
- 夏洛克  - 赫德森太太  别哭哭啼啼了
- Oh, Sherlock, Sherlock... - Don't snivel, Mrs Hudson,

1015
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,780
再哭  他也不会心软收起枪
it'll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet.

1016
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,330
否则那该是个多么柔情的世界啊
What a tender world that would be.

1017
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,180
救救我  夏洛克
Oh, please, Sherlock...

1018
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,280
我想你手上有我们想要的东西  福尔摩斯先生
I believe that you have something that we want, Mr Holmes.

1019
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,750
那你为什么不问我要
Then why don't you ask for it?

1020
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,230
我问过这位了  不过她看来啥都不晓得
Oh, I've been asking this one, she doesn't seem to know anything.

1021
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,310
但你心里清楚我要什么  对吧  福尔摩斯先生
But you know what I'm asking for, don't you, Mr Holmes?

1022
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,200
颈动脉

1023
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:41,510
颅骨

1024
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:41,510
眼睛

1025
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,820
动脉

1026
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,140
肋骨

1027
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:43,370
肺部

1028
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:44,900
我当然清楚
I believe I do.

1029
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,360
求你救救我
Please, help.

1030
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:52,240
先把你的手下打发走
First get rid of your boys.

1031
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,420
- 为什么  - 我不喜欢以一敌三
- Why? - I dislike being outnumbered,

1032
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,490
不然这间屋子里的蠢货就太多了
it makes for too much stupid in the room.

1033
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,480
- 你们两个回车里  - 然后开车走人
- You two, go to the car. - Then get into the car and drive away.

1034
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,000
别想骗我  你知道我是谁  这可没用
Don't try to trick me, you know who I am, it doesn't work.

1035
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,580
然后别再用枪指着我
Next, you can stop pointing that gun at me.

1036
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,190
好让你用枪指着我吗
So you can point a gun at me?

1037
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:15,630
我没枪
I'm unarmed.

1038
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,970
- 能让我搜下吗  - 快来搜
- Mind if I check? - Oh, I insist.

1039
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,280
白痴
Moron.

1040
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,950
- 谢谢  - 你没事了
- Oh, thank you. - You're all right now, you're all right.

1041
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,320
犯罪现场
务必打扰

1042
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:06,380
怎么了
What's going on?

1043
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,220
卧槽  这究竟是怎么了
Jeez, what the hell is happening?

1044
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,100
赫德森太太被个美国人打了
Mrs Hudson has been attacked by an American,

1045
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,900
我是在声张正义
I'm restoring balance to the universe.

1046
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,330
赫德森太太  老天啊  你没事吧
Mrs Hudson, my God, are you all right?

1047
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,690
他们对你做了什么
Jesus, what have they done to you?

1048
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,590
我真是太蠢了
Oh, I'm just being so silly.

1049
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,370
把她带到楼下去  照看好她
Take her downstairs and look after her.

1050
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,640
没事了  我来给你看看
It's all right, I'll have a look at that.

1051
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,320
我没事
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1052
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,120
你到底要不要告诉我是怎么回事
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

1053
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,730
当然了  快去
I expect so, now go.

1054
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,000
雷斯垂德
Lestrade?

1055
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:38,670
有人非法闯入我们在贝克街的公寓
We've had a break- in at Baker Street.

1056
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,140
把你手下最不讨人厌的警官派来  再叫辆救护车
Send your least irritating officers and an ambulance.

1057
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,150
不不不  我们没事
Oh, no, no, no, we're fine.

1058
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:48,950
是那个闯入者  他把自己弄伤了
No, it's the burglar, he's got himself rather badly injured.

1059
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:52,670
断了几根肋骨  脑震荡
Oh, a few broken ribs, fractured skull,

1060
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,660
还可能伤了肺
suspected punctured lung...

1061
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,010
他从窗子摔下去了
He fell out of a window.

1062
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,670
真疼
Oh, it stings.

1063
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,290
摔在了我的垃圾桶上
Oh, that was right on my bins.

1064
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:18,560
他到底摔下来了几次
And exactly how many times did he fall out the window?

1065
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:20,860
我记不清了  警长大人
It's all a bit of a blur, Detective Inspector.

1066
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:22,790
没数
I lost count.

1067
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,650
她今晚得睡在楼上我们房间
She'll have to sleep upstairs in our flat tonight,

1068
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,960
我们得照顾她
we need to look after her.

1069
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:33,850
- 不  - 她没事
- No... - She's fine. - 

1070
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,110
不  她有事  看看她
No, she's not, look at her.

1071
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,950
她得搬离贝克街几天
She's got to take some time away from Baker Street.

1072
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,210
她可以去她姐姐家住  这是医嘱
She can stay with her sister, doctor's orders.

1073
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,360
- 别傻了  - 老天爷  她受惊了
- Don't be absurd. - She's in shock, for God's sake,

1074
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:46,450
都是因为那天煞的摄像手机  手机到底在哪啊
and all over some stupid camera- phone - where is it anyway?

1075
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,530
我知道的最安全的地方
Safest place I know.

1076
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:50,820
你把手机放在你第二好的
You left it in the pocket

1077
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:53,240
睡衣袍子口袋里了  你个呆子
of your second best dressing gown, you clot!

1078
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:57,630
他们以为我被吓哭的时候  我想办法拿了出来
I managed to sneak it out when they thought I was having a cry.

1079
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:58,920
谢谢
Thank you.

1080
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,280
你真丢脸  约翰・华生
Shame on you, John Watson.

1081
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,960
- 我咋丢脸了  - 赫德森太太怎么能离开贝克街
- Shame on me? - Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street?

1082
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,750
不然英国可要沦陷了
England would fall.

1083
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,630
手机现在又在哪
Where is it now?

1084
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,970
没人会找的地方
Where no- one will look.

1085
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,000
不管那手机上有什么  肯定不只是照片
Whatever's on that phone is more than just pictures.

1086
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,270
没错
Yes, it is.

1087
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,460
这么说她还活着
So, she's alive then.

1088
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,380
你对此感觉如何
How are we feeling about that?

1089
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,020
新年快乐  约翰
Happy New Year, John.

1090
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,320
你觉得你会再见到她吗
Do you think you'll be seeing her again?

1091
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,030
新年快乐
夏・福

1092
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,610
- 那是手机吗  - 是部摄像手机
- Is that a phone? - It's a camera- phone.

1093
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,920
- 你在扫描手机吗  - 是的
- And you're x- raying it? - Yes, I am.

1094
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,320
- 那是谁的手机  - 一个女人的
- Whose phone is it? - A woman's.

1095
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,960
是你女朋友吗
Your girlfriend?

1096
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,290
我扫描她的东西就代表她是我女友了吗
She's my girlfriend because I'm x- raying her possessions?

1097
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,990
- 我们都会做傻事  - 那是
- Well, we all do silly things! - Yes...

1098
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,950
真的是这样吧
..They do, don't they?

1099
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:46,730
很傻
Very silly.

1100
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,400
她把手机送到我公寓的地址
She sent this to my address.

1101
01:02:53,120 --> 01:03:00,380
手机已锁

夏洛克
Hey, Sherlock...

1115
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,370
我们有了个客户
We have a client.

1116
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:48,830
啥  在你卧室里吗
What, in your bedroom?

1117
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,810
那  谁在追杀你
So, who's after you?

1118
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,410
- 想要杀我的人  - 是什么人
- People who want to kill me. - Who's that?

1119
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:02,900
杀手呗
Killers.

1120
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,190
你说得再具体一点也无妨
It would help if you were a tiny bit more specific.

1121
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:06,360
这么说你假造了你的死
So you faked your own death

1122
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,290
就是为了摆脱他们吗  - 成功了一阵子
to get ahead of them? - It worked for a while.

1123
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:10,520
但接着你告诉了约翰  也就是告诉了我
Except you let John know you're alive, therefore me.

1124
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,170
我知道你会替我保密
I knew you'd keep my secret.

1125
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,300
但你不行
You couldn't.

1126
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,400
但你确实没说出去吧
But you did, didn't you?

1127
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,770
我的摄像手机呢
Where's my camera- phone?

1128
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:20,040
不在这
It's not here.

1129
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:21,500
我们又不蠢
We're not stupid.

1130
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,030
你们拿它做了什么
What have you done with it?

1131
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,570
如果他们认为手机在你手上  肯定会监视你
If they've guessed you got it, they'll be watching you.

1132
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,730
那他们会以为我几个月前
Then they'll know I took a safety deposit box

1133
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,840
在斯特兰德找了个保险储存箱
at a bank on the Strand a few months ago.

1134
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,140
我需要那部手机
I need it.

1135
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,220
我们不能就这么过去拿吧
Well, we can't just go and get it, can we?

1136
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,140
茉莉・霍普  她能把手机拿到巴茨医院
Molly Hooper, she could collect it, take it to Barts.

1137
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,320
再让某个替你跑腿的流浪汉
Then one of your homeless

1138
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,920
带到楼下的咖啡厅里
network could bring it here, leave it in the cafe,

1139
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,940
让咖啡厅里的招待再把手机拿上来
one of the boys downstairs could bring it up the back.

1140
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:50,250
好极了  约翰  计划得好  能想到的都想到了
Very good, John, excellent plan, full of intelligent precautions.

1141
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,060
谢谢  所以我这就去打电话给...
Thank you. So, why don't I phone...

1142
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:58,040
这里面你都藏了什么
So, what do you keep on here?

1143
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,300
我是说大致上
In general, I mean?

1144
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,600
照片  情报  所有我觉得有用的东西
Pictures, information, anything I might find useful.

1145
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:04,840
- 为了敲诈吗  - 是为了保护自己
- For blackmail? - For protection.

1146
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,680
我一个人闯天下  难免有不得当的地方
I make my way in the world, I misbehave.

1147
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,010
我得保证在我需要的时候
I like to know people will

1148
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,440
别人能为我提供帮助
be on my side exactly when I need them to be.

1149
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,020
那你是怎么搞来的这些情报
So how do you acquire this information?

1150
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:16,460
我也说了  我的行为不得当
I told you - I misbehave.

1151
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:17,650
但你得到了比能保护自己
But you've acquired something more

1152
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,540
- 更危险的情报  你知道是什么吗  - 知道
- danger than protection. Do you know what it is? - Yes...

1153
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:22,700
但我搞不懂
..But I don't understand it.

1154
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,640
我想也是  让我看看
I assumed. Show me.

1155
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,030
密码
The passcode.

1156
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:42,550
密码没用
It's not working.

1157
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,100
当然  因为这只是我做的复制品
No, because it's a duplicate I had made

1158
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:46,720
好让我知道你输入了什么密码  是1058
into which you just entered the numbers 1058.

1159
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,120
我本以为你会选择
I assumed you'd choose something

1160
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,700
更有意义的密码  不过还是谢了
more specific than that, but thanks, anyway.

是不是真的我一摸就知道
I know when it's in my hand.

1181
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,420
你真厉害
Oh, you're rather good.

1182
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,080
你也不赖
You're not so bad.

1183

哈米什
Hamish.

1184
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:22,580
约翰・哈米什・华生不错  作为孩子名字的话
John Hamish Watson, just if you were looking for baby names.

1185
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:28,250
有个男人  一个国防部的官员  我知道他的癖好
There was a man, an MOD official and I knew what he liked.

1186
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,460
他就是喜欢炫耀
One of the things he liked was showing off.

1187
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,740
他告诉我说  这封邮件可以拯救世界
He told me this email was going to save the world.

1188
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,800
他不知道我拍了下来
He didn't know it but I photographed it.

1189
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,320
他当时有点脱不开身
He was a bit tied up at the time.

1190
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,970
屏幕上看有点小  你能看清楚吗
It's a bit small on that screen, can you read it?

1191
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,130
007确认位置

1192
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,830
- 能  - 显然是密码
- Yes. - Code, obviously.

1193
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,600
我让英国最厉害的解码专家看了看
I had one of the country's best cryptographers take a look,

1194
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,530
他也被搞得一头雾水
though he was mostly upside down, as I recall.

1195
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,840
解不开
Couldn't figure it out.

1196
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,320
你有办法吗  福尔摩斯先生
What can you do, Mr Holmes?

1197
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,700
来吧  露一手给姑娘看看
Go on, impress a girl.

1198
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,100
还有一点没想明白
There's a margin for error,

1199
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,340
但我肯定是架波音747
but I'm pretty sure there's a 747

1200
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,900
明天六点半将于西斯罗机场起飞  飞往巴尔的摩
leaving Heathrow tomorrow at 6.30 for Baltimore.

1201
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:22,550
显然这条信息能拯救世界  但我不确定怎么个救法
Apparently it's going to save the world, I'm not sure how,

1202
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,880
但等我一会  我才想了八秒钟
but give me a moment, I've only been on the case eight seconds.

1203
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:31,250
得了  这不是密码  是飞机上的座位
Oh, come on, it's not code, these are seats on a jet.

1204
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:33,960
看  没有字母I  因为会和数字1搞混
Look, no 'I' because it can be mistaken for one.

1205
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,420
没有K以后的字母  因为飞机就这么宽
No letters past 'K' - the width of the plane is the limit.

1206
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,620
数字总是不按顺序排列
The numbers always appear not in sequence,

1207
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:39,760
但字母则几乎没有乱过顺序
but the letters have little runs of sequence all over the place.

1208
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,590
家人和夫妻都坐在一起
Families and couples sitting together.

1209
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,600
只有巨型喷气式飞机的座椅才会排到K
Only a Jumbo's wide enough for a letter 'K'

1210
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:47,110
还有55排  所以机顶上还有一层
or rows past 55, so there's always an upstairs.

1211
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:49,590
有13排说明不是那些迷信的航空公司
A row 13 eliminates superstitious airlines.

1212
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,850
航班号的组合规律  007  又能排除一些信息
The style of the flight number, '007', eliminates a few more.

1213
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:53,880
考虑到最初的情报来源
Assuming a British point

1214
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:55,970
可以推断航班从英国起飞
of origin because of the original source,

1215
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:00,430
加上迫在眉睫的危机  唯一符合所有条件
and assuming the crisis is imminent, the only flight that matches

1216
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,320
并且在本周起飞的飞机
all the criteria and departs within the week is the

1217
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:04,720
就是六点半从伦敦到巴尔的摩的飞机
6.30 to Baltimore tomorrow from Heathrow.

1218
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:09,000
别急着要赞扬我
Please don't feel obliged to tell me that was amazing,

1219
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:09,950
约翰已经这么干过了
John's expressed that in

1220
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,050
他用光了所有表示赞扬的词语
every possible variant available in English.

1221
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,760
我真想在这个书桌上要了你
I would have you right here, on this desk,

1222
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,920
要到你求饶  还是两次
until you begged for mercy twice.

1223
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,990
约翰  你能否查下航班表  看看我说得对不对
John, can you check those flight schedules, see if I'm right?

1224
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,270
在查了
I'm on it, yeah.

1225
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,160
我这辈子都没求过绕
I've never begged for mercy in my life.

1226
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,180
你这次要求饶  还是两次
Twice.

1227
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,430
嗯  你说得没错  007号航班
Yeah, you're right, flight double 'o' seven.

1228
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,130
- 你说什么  - 你说得没错
- What did you say? - You're right.

1229
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:40,270
不  你之后说了什么
No, what did you say after that?

1230
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,340
007  007号航班
Double 'o' seven, flight double 'o' seven.

1231
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,120
007  007
Double 'o' seven, double 'o' seven...

1232
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,040
007有什么含义
Something, double 'o' seven...

1233
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,050
是什么
What?

1234
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,500
波音

1235

1245
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,560
007  是什么
Double 'o' seven, double 'o' seven, what?

1246
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:10,740
到底是什么
What, something, what?!

1247
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:14,820
施行邦德航空计划
Bond Air is go.

1248
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:16,930
施行邦德航空计划
Bond Air is go.

1249
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,570
施行邦德航空计划
Bond Air is go.

1250

喷气式

飞机

1252
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:23,840
向你

1253
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,840
问好

1254
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:23,840
亲爱

1255

1256
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:23,840
福尔摩斯

1257
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:23,840
先生

1258

喷气式飞机 向你 问好 亲爱 的 福尔摩斯先生

1259

1260
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:28,840
喷气式飞机 向你 问好 亲爱 的 福尔摩斯先生

1261
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:44,430
喷气式飞机  向你问好  亲爱的福尔摩斯先生

1262
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,070
施行邦德航空计划  已经决定了
'Bond Air is go, that's decided.

1263
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,100
跟考文垂那边核实一下
'Check with the Coventry lot.'

1264
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,690
- 考文垂  - 我从没去过
- Coventry. - I've never been.

1265
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,160
那里怎么样
Is it nice?

1266
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,250
约翰呢
Where's John?

1267
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,260
他出去了  出去了几小时了
He went out, a couple of hours ago.

1268
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:43,900
我就是在和他说话
I was just talking to him.

1269
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,310
他说了你会这样
He said you do that.

1270
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,210
考文垂和这又有什么关系
What's Coventry got to do with anything?

1271
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:54,210
这只是个说法  不知是真是假
It's a story, probably not true - 

1272
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,120
在二战期间
in the Second World War,

1273
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,140
盟军知道考文垂会被德军轰炸
the allies knew Coventry was going to get bombed,

1274
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,680
因为他们破解了德军的密码机
because they'd broken the German code,

1275
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,120
但他们不想让德国知道他们破了密码
but didn't want the Germans to know that they've broken the code.

1276
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,830
所以他们就任其被轰炸了
so they let it happen anyway.

1277
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,040
你有和谁亲密接触过吗
Have you ever had anyone?

1278
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:08,570
你说什么
I'm sorry?

1279
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,100
我说的接触可是下流含义哦
And when I say had, I'm being indelicate.

1280
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,810
- 我不懂  - 那我婉转点吧
- I don't understand. - I'll be delicate then.

1281
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:19,900
- 一起吃晚饭吧  - 为什么
- Let's have dinner. - Why?

1282
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,050
- 你饿了吧  - 不饿  - 很好
- You might be hungry. - I'm not. - Good.

1283
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:28,350
我为什么想要吃晚饭
Why would I...want to have dinner...

1284
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,260
既然我不饿
..If I wasn't hungry?

1285
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,490
福尔摩斯先生  如果这是世界末日
Mr Holmes, if it was the end of the world,

1286
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:38,460
如果这是毁灭前的最后一晚
if this was the very last night...

1287
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,640
你会和我一起吃晚饭吗
..Would you have dinner with me?

1288
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,980
夏洛克
Sherlock?

1289
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:45,760
太迟了
Too late.

1290
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,490
这不是世界末日  而是赫德森太太
That's not the end of the world, that's Mrs Hudson.

1291
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:52,870
夏洛克  有个男人来了
Sherlock, this man was at the door,

1292
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,810
门铃不会坏了吧
is the bell still not working?

1293
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,000
他打坏了
He shot it.

1294
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,920
你又是来带走我的吗
Have you come to take me away again?

1295
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,890
- 是的  福尔摩斯先生  - 那我拒绝
- Yes, Mr Holmes. - Well, I decline.

1296
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,060
我觉得你不会拒绝
I don't think you do.

1297
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,780
飞机的座椅上会有一枚炸弹
There's going to be a bomb on a passenger jet.

1298
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,490
英国人和美国人都知道这一点
The British and Americans know about it,

1299
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:35,880
但为了不暴露他们的情报来源
but rather than expose their source

1300
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:39,370
他们决定任其发生  飞机会爆炸
they're going to let it happen - the plane will blow up.

1301
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,780
考文垂事件的重演
Coventry all over again.

1302
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,820
时过境迁  烂事依然
The wheel turns, nothing is ever new.

1303
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:24,670
你看上去好多了
Well, you're looking all better.

1304
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,670
感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

1305
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:30,180
比如想冲你脑袋来上一枪吗  先生
Like putting a bullet in your brain, sir.

1306
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,060
我要是这么干了  他们会赏我一枚奖章
They'd pin a medal on me if I did...

1307
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,030
先生
..Sir.

1308
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,900
考文垂难题
The Coventry conundrum.

1309
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,650
你觉得我的解决方法如何
What do you think of my solution?

1310
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,700
死者航班
The flight of the dead.

1311
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:30,050
飞机在半空中爆炸  恐怖分子达到了目的
Plane blows up midair, mission accomplished for the terrorists,

1312
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:32,710
伤亡数上百  但没人死亡
hundreds of casualties, but nobody dies.

1313
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,520
很干净吧  你觉得呢
Neat, don't you think?

1314
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:38,590
其实你很早就接触到事情的真相了
You've been stumbling around the fringes of this one for ages.

1315
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:41,650
还是说你觉得太无聊  而忽略了其中的规律
Or were you too bored to notice the pattern?

1316
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:45,790
爷爷去世时他们不让我们去看他
They wouldn't let us see Granddad when he was dead.

1317
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:50,000
她不是我姑姑  我分辨得出人的骨灰
She's not my real aunt - I know human ash.

1318
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,890
我们之前和德国人有过类似的合作
We ran a similar project with the Germans a while back,

1319
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:56,860
而其中一位乘客没有赶上飞机
though I believe one of our passengers didn't make the flight.

1320
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,280
就是你的那件案子的死者
But that's the deceased for you...

1321
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:04,310
无论如何  太迟了
..late, in every sense of the word.

1322
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,990
飞机要怎么飞
How is the plane going to fly?

1323
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:09,330
当然了  无人驾驶  老把戏了
Oh, of course, unmanned aircraft, hardly new.

1324
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:10,720
它不会起飞
It doesn't fly.

1325
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,220
永远不会
It will never fly.

1326
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,650
整个计划都取消了
This entire project is cancelled.

1327
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:18,400
恐怖组织得知了我们知道炸弹的事
The terrorist cells have been informed that we know about the bomb.

1328
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,790
现在骗不了他们了
We can't fool them now.

1329
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,650
我们输得一败涂地
We've lost everything.

1330
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,540
一封邮件中的一小段话
One fragment of one email,

1331
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:31,000
成年累月的计划  结束了
and months and years of planning - finished.

1332
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,970
- 你国防部的手下  - 老鼠屎坏了一锅粥
- Your MOD man. - That's all it takes.

1333
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,930
一个孤独幼稚的男人  总想显摆自己
One lonely, naive man, desperate to show off,

1334
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,880
和一个聪明到让他自以为很特别的女人
and a woman clever enough to make him feel special.

1335
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,690
你们国防部选人时应该更谨慎点
You should screen your defence people more carefully.

1336
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,650
我没在说那个国防部的人
I'm not talking about the MOD man,

1337
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,670
夏洛克  我说的是你
Sherlock, I'm talking about you!

1338
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,800
身陷困境的少女
The damsel in distress.

1339
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:00,970
到头来  你的观察力还这么敏锐吗
In the end, are you really so obvious?

1340
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,200
因为这不是明摆着的吗
Because this was textbook.

1341
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:09,190
爱的承诺  失去的痛苦  挽回的快乐
The promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption.

1342
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:14,650
然后再给他个谜题  看他尽情发挥
Then give him a puzzle and watch him dance.

1343
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,390
别胡说了
Don't be absurd!

1344
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:17,590
胡说
Absurd?

1345
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:21,790
帮她破解那封邮件你用了多久
How quickly did you decipher that email for her?

1346
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,700
一分钟吗
Was it the full minute?

1347
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,980
还是你就这么想表现一下
Or were you really eager to impress?

1348
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,380
我看不到5秒钟
I think it was less than five seconds.

1349
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:32,300
是我让你着了她的道
I drove you into her path.

1350
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:37,510
抱歉  我真没想到
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1351
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:39,630
福尔摩斯先生  看来我们得谈谈
Mr Holmes, I think we need to talk.

1352
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:43,230
我也觉得  还有很多事我不太清楚
So do I, there are a number of aspects I'm still not clear on.

1353
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,660
不是你  小阿福  没你的事了
Not you, Junior, you're done now.

1354
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,020
还有很多  非常多
There's more, loads more.

1355
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,320
这手机里存着秘密  照片
On this phone I've got secrets, pictures

1356
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,550
还有能让你一败涂地的丑闻
and scandals that could topple your whole world.

1357
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,800
你无法想象我能造成多大的破坏
You have no idea how much havoc I can cause

1358
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,060
你也不知道如何阻止我
and exactly one way to stop me.

1359
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,810
除非你想告诉你的上司
Unless you want to tell your masters

1360
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:04,420
你最大的安全漏洞就是你弟弟
that your biggest security leak is your own little brother.

1361
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,160
我们可以找人破解你的手机
We have people who can get into this.

1362
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,100
我早就试过了
I tested that theory for you.

1363
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:20,590
我给了夏洛克・福尔摩斯六个月时间
I let Sherlock Holmes try it for six months.

1364
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:21,670
亲爱的夏洛克
Sherlock, dear, tell him

1365
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,120
告诉他你扫描我手机时发现了什么
what you found when you x- rayed my camera phone.

1366
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,780
手机壳下面装了四个零件
There are four additional units wired inside the casing,

1367
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,060
我猜是含酸物质或微型炸药
I suspect containing acid or a small amount of explosive.

1368
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,640
如果有人试图打开手机壳  硬盘就会销毁
Any attempt to open the casing will burn the hard drive.

1369
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,150
是炸药
Explosive.

1370
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:35,400
更符合我性格
It's more me.

1371
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,240
有些数据是可恢复的
Some data is always recoverable.

1372
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,480
你可以试试
Take that risk.

1373
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:41,140
解锁需要密码
You have a passcode to open this.

1374
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:42,370
很遗憾地告诉你
I deeply regret to say,

1375
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:45,530
我们可以把密码逼问出来
we have people who can extract it from you.

1376
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:47,560
- 夏洛克  - 有两组密码
- Sherlock? - There will be two passcodes - 

1377
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,190
一个可以解锁  一个会烧掉驱动
one to open the phone, one to burn the drive.

1378
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,530
就算威胁她  也不知道她给的是哪一个
Even under duress, you can't know which one she's giving you

1379
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:56,310
- 而机会只有一次  - 他真是厉害
- and there would be no point in second attempt. - He's good, isn't he?

1380
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,160
我真该好好调教他
I should have him on a leash.

1381
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,810
值得一试
In fact, I might.

1382
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:03,990
那我们就毁了它  谁也别想得到里面的信息
We destroy this, then. No- one has the information.

1383
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,720
行  好注意
Fine, good idea.

1384
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,470
不过你要毁掉的这信息
Unless there are lives of British citizens

1385
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:10,560
可是这关系着英国人民的生死
depending on the information you burn.

1386
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,010
- 是嘛  - 告诉你是为你好
- Are there? - Telling you would be playing fair.

1387
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,310
我不想再玩游戏了
I'm not playing any more.

1388
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:22,020
这是我的要求
A list of my requests,

1389
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,750
还要对我进行绝对安全的保护措施
find some ideas about my protection once they're granted.

1390
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:30,470
要说这花不了国家多少钱
I'd say it wouldn't blow much of a hole in the wealth of a nation,

1391
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:32,540
那是假的
but then I'd be lying.

1392
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:37,000
你可能需要时间考虑一下
I imagine you'd like to sleep on it.

1393
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:39,040
谢谢  没错
Thank you, yes.

1394
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,210
真可惜
Too bad.

1395
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,650
你可以去着手办这件事了
Off you pop and talk to people.

1396
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:50,480
你考虑得十分周道
You've been very...thorough.

1397
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:53,880
我们的人能有你一半能耐就好了
I wish our lot were half as good as you.

1398
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:58,280
并不是全靠我自己  有人帮我
I can't take all the credit, I had a bit of help.

1399
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,710
金・莫里亚蒂向你们问好
Jim Moriarty sends his love.

1400
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,850
是  他就没消停过
Yes, he's been in touch.

1401
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,300
迫不及待想让我盯上他
Seems desperate for my attention,

1402
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,150
那我就满足他
which I'm sure can be arranged.

1403
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:12,200
信息一直在我手上  但我不知道怎么办
I had all this stuff and never knew what to do with it.

1404
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:14,650
多谢这个犯罪顾问
Thank God for the consultant criminal.

1405
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,410
给了我很多建议
Gave me a lot of advice

1406
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:19,570
教我如何跟你们打交道
about how to play the Holmes boys.

1407
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,470
知道他叫你们什么吗
Do you know what he calls you?

1408
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,310
冰人
The Ice Man...

1409
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:25,930
和处子
..and the Virgin.

1410
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,700
他不要任何回报  我想他只是喜欢捣乱
Didn't even ask for anything, I think he just likes to cause trouble

1411
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,780
我要的就是这种男人
now that's my kind of man.

1412
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,040
所以成全了你
And here you are,

1413
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:37,970
让全国为之屈服的施虐女王
the dominatrix who brought a nation to its knees.

1414
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,030
干得漂亮
Nicely played.

1415
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,400
不
No.

1416
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:44,940
什么
Sorry?

1417
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:48,900
我说不
I said no.

1418
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,280
差点成功  不过没戏
Very, very close, but no.

1419
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,930
你太入迷了
You got carried away.

1420
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,440
但你的游戏玩过了  你过于沉迷了
The game was too elaborate, you were enjoying yourself too much.

1421
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:58,190
可没有"过头"这一说
There's no such thing as too much.

1422
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:00,420
你可以享受追捕的兴奋感
Oh, enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine.

1423
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,330
渴望用这游戏作为消遣  我完全赞同
Craving the distraction of the game, I sympathise entirely,

1424
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:04,570
可你太感情用事
but sentiment?

1425
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,720
感情用事是失败者的生理缺陷
Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side.

1426
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,990
感情用事  你说什么呢
Sentiment? What are you talking about?

1427
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,430
你
You.

1428
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,670
老天
Oh, dear God.

1429
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,180
看看这个小可怜
Look at the poor man.

1430
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:21,310
你不会真觉得我对你有兴趣吧
You don't actually think I was interested in you?

1431
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:22,900
为什么
Why?

1432
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,940
因为你是伟大的夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Because you're the great Sherlock Holmes,

1433
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:27,320
戴着滑稽帽子的大侦探
the clever detective in the funny hat?

1434
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,960
不
No.

1435
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,450
因为我摸到了你的脉搏
Because I took your pulse.

1436
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,220
脉搏加快
Elevated.

1437
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,620
瞳孔放大
Your pupils dilated.

1438
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:59,080
我猜约翰・华生觉得我不解风情
I imagine John Watson thinks love's a mystery to me,

1439
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,860
但两人碰出火花非常简单  而且十分致命
but the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive.

1440
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,030
我们初次见面时你说
When we first met, you told me that

1441
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:06,350
伪装是一幅自画像  一点没错
disguise is always a self- portrait - how true of you.

1442
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,230
保险柜的密码是你的三围
the combination to your safe, your measurements - 

1443
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,110
但这个  这个就私人多了
but this, this is far more intimate,

1444
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:14,330
这是你的心  而你不应该随心而为
this is your heart and you should never let it rule your head.

1445
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:17,730
如果你随便选组数字做密码
You could have chosen any random number

1446
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:19,590
今天你就能顺利从这里离开
and walked out of here today with everything you work for.

1447
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:22,140
但你就是忍不住  对吧
But you just couldn't resist it, could you?

1448
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,450
我一直认为爱是个危险的不利因素
I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage.

1449
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:29,250
感谢你最终又证明了这一点
Thank you for the final proof.

1450
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,080
我所说的一切都是假的
Everything I said, it's not real.

1451
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:37,690
我只是在玩游戏而已
I was just playing the game.

1452
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:38,880
我知道
I know.

1453
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,290
而你输了
And this is just losing.

1454
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,800

hope the contents make up for any inconvenience

1472

今晚我给你造成的任何麻烦
I may have caused you tonight.

1473
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,880
- 肯定可以  - 你要是好心  就把她关起来
- I'm certain they will. - If you're feeling kind, lock her up,

1474
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,990
放她走的话  没了手机她肯定活不长
otherwise let her go and I doubt she'll survive long without her pretection.

1475
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:04,310
- 你是要我求你吗  - 对
- Are you expecting me to beg? - Yes.

1476
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,250
求你
Please.

1477
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:14,930
你说得对
You're right.

1478
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,810
我肯定活不过半年
I won't even last six months.

1479
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:21,230
晚饭的事情抱歉了
Sorry about dinner.

1480
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:47,350
你不抽烟
You don't smoke.

1481
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:50,160
我也从不来咖啡馆
I also don't frequent cafes.

1482
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:01,070
这是艾琳・阿德勒的档案
This the file on Irene Adler?

1483
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,180
永久封档
Closed forever.

1484
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,050
我正要去通知我弟弟
I am about to go and inform my brother - 

1485
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,480
或者你愿意的话  由你去说
or, if you prefer, you are - 

1486
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,370
她在美国申请到了
that she somehow got herself

1487
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:13,320
证人保护计划
into a witness protection scheme in America.

1488
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,240
新名字  新身份
New name, new identity.

1489
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:19,540
她会健康地活着
She will survive and thrive...

1490
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,950
但是他永远见不到她了
..but he will never see her again.

1491
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:23,320
他会在意么
Why would he care?

1492
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,310
最后是他摒弃了她
He despised her at the end.

1493
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:28,490
提起她都不说名字  只是说"那个女人"
Won't even mention her by name, just 'The Woman'.

1494
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,790
那是厌恶还是赞扬
Is that loathing or a salute?

1495
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,500
独一无二  唯一让他在意的女人
One of a kind, the one woman who matters.

1496
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:37,420
他不是那种人
He's not like that.

1497
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:41,580
我觉得他不会有这种感觉
He doesn't feel things that way, I don't think.

1498
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:45,800
我弟弟的大脑堪比科学家或哲学家
My brother has the brain of a scientist or a philosopher,

1499
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:48,250
可他选择当名侦探
yet he elects to be a detective.

1500
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:51,340
关于他的内心  我们能推论多少
What might we deduce about his heart?

1501
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,530
我不知道
I don't know.

1502
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,500
我也不知道
Neither do I.

1503
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,780
但他最初的愿望是当一名海盗
But, initially, he wanted to be a pirate.

1504
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:02,190
他应该可以接受
He'll be OK with this - 

1505
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:05,050
证人保护计划  再也不能见面  他不会有事
witness protection, never seeing her again - he'll be fine.

1506
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,320
我同意
I agree.

1507
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,910
所以我决定这样告诉他
That's why I decided to tell him that.

1508
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:13,370
那事实是什么
Instead of what?

1509
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,780
她死了
She's dead.

1510
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:20,440
两个月前  她被卡拉奇的一个恐怖组织俘获
She was captured by a terrorist cell in Karachi two months ago

1511
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:21,880
被砍头了
and beheaded.

1512
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,270
确定是她本人吗
It was definitely her?

1513
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:30,790
她耍过一次诈
She's done this before.

1514
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:33,140
这次我保证万无一失
I was thorough this time.

1515
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,400
想骗我得夏洛克・福尔摩斯亲自出马
It would take Sherlock Holmes to fool me,

1516
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:40,130
可我觉得他并不在场  对吧
and I don't think he was on hand, do you?

1517
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,210
所以
So...

1518
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,290
我们怎么对夏洛克说
what shall we tell Sherlock?

1519
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,530
看来你有消息要告诉我
Clearly you've got news.

1520
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:04,080
如果是利兹三连环杀人案的话  凶手是园丁
If it's about the Leeds triple murder, it was the gardener.

1521
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,870
- 就没人注意到耳环么  - 好啊
- Nobody notice the earring? - Hi.

1522
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:12,370
不  是关于艾琳・阿德勒的事
Er no, it's, um...it's about Irene Adler.

1523
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:14,940
怎么了
Well?

1524
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,640
出事了吗  她回来了
Something happened? Has she come back?

1525
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,590
没  她...
No, she's...

1526
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:21,350
我在楼下遇到麦考夫了  他要去接个电话
I just bumped into Mycroft downstairs, he had to take a call.

1527
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,320
她回伦敦了吗
Is she back in London?

1528
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,360
没
No...

1529
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,420
她...
She's, er...

1530
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:33,410
- 她在美国  - 美国
- She's in America. - America?

1531
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:36,720
看来她申请到了证人保护计划
Got herself on a witness protection scheme, apparently.

1532
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,900
不知道她怎么办到  但是...
Don't know how she swung it, but...

1533
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:41,850
你懂的
well, you know.

1534
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:44,440
- 懂什么  - 你不能再见她了
- I know what? - You won't be able to see her again.

1535
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:47,240
- 我为什么想再见她  - 我也没这么说
- Why would I want to see her again? - Didn't say you did.

1536
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,620
- 这是她的档案吗  - 是
- Is that her file? - Yes,

1537
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,730
我正要拿去还给麦考夫
I was going to take it back to Mycroft.

1538
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:52,740
- 你想要...  - 不要
- Do you want to... - No.

1539
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:02,460
那个  其实...
Listen, actually...

1540
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,680
把她的手机给我
But I will have the camera- phone though.

1541
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:09,010
- 里面没东西了  都被删掉了  - 我知道
- There's nothing on it anymore, it's been stripped... - I know, but I...

1542
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,650
但我还是想要
..I'll still have it.

1543
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:14,800
我得把它还给麦考夫  你不能留着
I've got to give this back to Mycroft, you can't keep it.

1544
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:18,350
夏洛克  我得把它还给麦考夫
Sherlock, I have to give this to Mycroft,

1545
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:20,100
这是政府财产了
it's the government's now...

1546
01:26:20,110 --> 01:26:21,320
拜托了
Please.

1547
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,870
谢谢
Thank you.

1548
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:40,630
- 我得把东西还回去了  - 好
- Well, I'd better take this back. - Yes.

1549
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,590
在那之后  她有再给你发过短信吗
Did she ever text you again, after all that?

1550
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:55,230
几个月前有一次
Once, a few months ago.

1551
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,600
说了什么
What did she say?

1552
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,180
再见  福尔摩斯先生
"Goodbye, Mr Holmes."

1553
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:32,180

就算是你也得吃饭  一起吃晚饭吧

1565
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:26,480

我想给你寄个圣诞礼物

1567
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:27,380
