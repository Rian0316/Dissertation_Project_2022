1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,280
You know, one of the
downsides to a life of crime

2
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:07,399
is that occasionally you have to do
business with people who are, um...

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
Well, for want of a
better word, criminals.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,280
Like most things that end
with you hanging upside down

5
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,560
in a deserted warehouse,

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,079
it started with a really good idea.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,159
"A Small Cat ln The Garden was
painted by Pablo Picasso in 1903,

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,519
"in what was known
as his Blue Period.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,539
"It measures 12 inches by 11 inches and
was stolen from a private collection

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,420
"in the early hours
of Sunday morning."

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,220
Mmmm...
Value?

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,820
- It's been insured for 3 million.
- Wow.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,519
"Police say the gang was clearly
experienced and well informed."

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,140
- Meaning it was stolen to order.
- No question.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,760
- Is Mad Dolly still around?
- My thoughts exactly.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,520
- Who? - Dolly Hammond, she's
the best Picasso forger in London.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,959
She's all right, but she's just
a bit.... She's...unique.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,380
Yeah, she's a bit different,
you know.

19
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,079
- Insane.
- Yeah. - Nice.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,919
She's a lovely old bird
really, but, erm...

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
she used to have
the hots for Albie.

22
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:09,479
Why would we need someone to forge a
painting that's already been stolen?

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,279
Well, because now its theft
has already been reported...

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,759
Collectors will believe you if you
tell 'em you're trying to sell it.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,599
It's brilliant!

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,159
- Yes, it is. - Yes, it is.
- As always.

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,319
Well, potentially brilliant.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Depending on who you try
and sell the fake to.

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,199
And here's a little tip

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,320
should you ever find yourself
trying to flog a fake Picasso...

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,320
Don't try and sell it
to the bloke

32
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,920
who the original was nicked
from in the first place.

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,919
Aye-aye.
Here come the cavalry.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,040
Ash!

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,239
Gently, Sean, gently!

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,640
Oooh...

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,640
- Where's Mickey?
- They pulled a gun on us.

38
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:17,639
- Petre Sava's men have taken him.
- What happened?

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,060
Well, it's a very long story,
but the upshot is

40
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,359
the original was nicked
from him in the first place.

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,319
He wasn't happy at us telling
him it was us who nicked it,

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,760
and then trying to sell him a fake
back instead of the real thing.

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,719
This is not Picasso!

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,839
This is not my painting!

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,540
So Petre Sava is holding
on to Mickey till

46
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,239
we deliver the real
Picasso back to him.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,200
We haven't got the real one.

48
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,299
No, I did mention that,
and we argued for a bit,

49
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,360
then he threatened a
level of physical violence

50
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:53,059
I wasn't comfortable with,
so I backed down.

51
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,340
He's given us six hours to find it.

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,140
So what happens if we
can't find the real painting?

53
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:19,639
Oh, he was very specific about that.

54
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,560
Mickey's a dead man.

55
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,539
sync and corrections by Bellows
www.addic7ed.com

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,800
So no-one's got anything?

57
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,299
- But that's impossible.
- Well, it's not a local crew.

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,660
Someone would know if it was.

59
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:01,259
By now the real painting could've
been shipped out of the country.

60
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,100
Yeah, but, come on, it's weird
that no-one's heard anything.

61
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,499
Or if they have, they
don't want to share it.

62
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,340
What about that Dolly the forger?
Would she know?

63
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,739
If she's a Picasso freak, she
might have heard something.

64
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,239
I suppose...

65
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,439
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's worth a try.
- Let's do it.

66
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,720
Can't find a decent
thief these days,

67
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,119
they're all gangsters,
they've got no class.

68
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,920
- Not like you Albert.
- Thank you, Dolly.

69
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:28,579
I'd string 'em all up.
By the testicles.

70
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,679
Leave them there for
the crows to pick at.

71
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,719
Feed what's left to the
pigs, like we used to.

72
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,179
So you've no idea who
stole the Picasso, Dolly?

73
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,699
- What Picasso?
- A Small Cat ln The Garden.

74
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,579
You've had your copy,
I've already done it.

75
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,460
No, no,
I'm talking about the real one.

76
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:49,700
He's cute.

77
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,660
Dolly, the painting, have
you any idea who nicked it?

78
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:55,059
How would I know that?

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,800
- Has no-one said anything to you?
- Who? - Anyone.

80
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,099
- Said what? - About the painting.
- What painting?

81
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,280
- The Picasso.
- I don't know who nicked it.

82
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:05,079
- Well, that's what I'm asking, innit?
- I've told you. Who are you?

83
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,620
Oh... I'm Emma.

84
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:10,339
What are you doing
in my house?

85
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,859
I'm with Albert.

86
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,219
This your floozy, is it?

87
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,139
No, no, no, no. You're the
only woman for me, Dolly.

88
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,120
Ohhh!
Aah...unlucky.

89
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,819
Dolly, do you know anything
at all about the painting?

90
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,780
Anything that might help
us find out who nicked it?

91
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,500
I mean, was there someone who
really liked it? A private collector?

92
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,200
Or did someone try and
buy it before and failed?

93
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:33,779
Anything.

94
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,279
I know where every
Picasso in London is.

95
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,300
I can smell them.

96
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,540
Except this one.

97
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,160
Dolly, look, is there any way you
can track it down, you know?

98
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,259
I mean, what's the
word on the street?

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,939
Do I look like Huggy Bear?

100
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,060
Dolly!
We need to find it.

101
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,660
I'll see what I can do, if...

102
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,739
..he sings to me,

103
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,180
and he snogs me.

104
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,539
♪ Hello Dolly, well, Hello Dolly

105
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,139
♪ lt's so nice to have you
back where you belong! ♪

106
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,539
SHE LAUGHS

107
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,580
Oh...

108
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,420
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

109
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:25,500
No.

110
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,140
Forget it. It's...
it's not happening.

111
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:31,139
Sean, think about Mickey.

112
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,580
- (Forget Mickey.) - (Do it.)
- I don't want to... - Do it.

113
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,980
- Don't want to!
- Sean...

114
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,420
HE WHIMPERS

115
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,100
Naughty!

116
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,860
SHE CHUCKLES

117
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,019
Well?

118
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,099
Erm...well, I should
know in a couple of hours.

119
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
Send him.

120
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,140
THUMP

121
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,660
THUMP

122
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,060
CAR ALARM

123
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,180
HE SIGHS

124
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,240
Now, just in case Dolly
draws a blank,

125
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:53,139
we'd better cover all the angles.

126
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,580
Albert, use your police contacts,
see if they've got any leads

127
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:58,419
- on the robbery or any
idea who it was. - Right.

128
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,780
- Sean, take the car. See what else you
can find out about Petre Sava. - OK.

129
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,260
- What about us? - You and me
will go and see Cyclops.

130
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:09,140
Now, art's not really his thing,
but he might have heard something.

131
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,059
I've got The Dogs Playing Snooker,
if that's any good to you?

132
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,459
It's a classic.

133
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,899
I used to have The Bird On The
Tennis Court Scratching Her Bum,

134
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,019
but it got stiletto damage
in a domestic dispute.

135
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,299
- Well, women don't really get art,
do they? - Is that right?

136
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,859
Yeah, well-known fact.

137
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,339
They've got no patience for it.

138
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,300
That's why all the major
artists are all men.

139
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:44,699
Women would never be
able to finish anything.

140
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,339
They'd be halfway through
The Laughing Cavalier,

141
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,139
then they'd wander off and start
colour-coding their shoe cupboard.

142
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,040
Look, can we get back
to the matter in hand?

143
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,739
- Which was?
- A Small Cat ln The Garden.

144
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,739
- The stolen Picasso.
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
So who nicked it?

146
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,399
- Art's not really my thing.
- I said that, didn't I? - Yeah.

147
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,760
- But I heard about it.
- What?

148
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:07,000
- I said I heard about it.
- No, no, no, what did you hear?

149
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,319
- That it was nicked. You want a chip?
- No. Thank you.

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,220
- Any chance of a date?
- None.

151
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,318
Sympathy shag? Think of it as
charity work, it's been a while.

152
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,019
Look, Cyclops, Mickey's in trouble.

153
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,079
Whatever you know,
you need to tell me.

154
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,839
- We haven't haggled yet.
- What? You're going to charge us?

155
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,440
'Scuse me.
This is still a capitalist society.

156
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
I thought Mickey was your mate.

157
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:33,759
Well, he's more of an
acquaintance, really.

158
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,080
But that said, I'm willing
to make a discount.

159
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,879
How much?

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,320
Call it a nifty.

161
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,639
OK.

162
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,959
I can't tell if these
things are related,

163
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,580
but the day
before the Picasso was nicked,

164
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:52,760
a hardcore jock crew flew in.

165
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,460
Scottish?

166
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,679
The McCrary brothers. They took
over a house in Westbridge Grove.

167
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,080
Now, all I know about
'em is that they nick to order,

168
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,279
anything you like,
usually upmarket.

169
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,759
Paintings, cars, antiques...

170
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,320
I mean they could be here for
something else, but...

171
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,400
It's worth asking the question,
innit?

172
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,760
OK. What do you think?

173
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,659
Well, we could knock
on the door, say "Och, aye, the noo,"

174
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,020
and ask 'em if they've
just nicked a Picasso.

175
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,119
It's direct. But as we
don't know who they are,

176
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,300
I think it's a little bit foolhardy.

177
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,199
Yeah, I know, that's
what I like about it.

178
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,319
Ash?
DOOR BUZZER

179
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,340
- 'Who is it?'
- It's Ash Morgan, I need to talk

180
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:43,839
to you about the
Picasso you just nicked.

181
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,320
- Have you lost your marbles?
- Yeah. We haven't got much time.

182
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,719
What's the worst that could happen?

183
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,460
They could kill us!

184
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,339
Yeah, well, then at least Mickey
would know we died trying.

185
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,780
- You've got some bottle. - Yeah, well,
needs must, and all of that.

186
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,079
Well, in you come, then.

187
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,620
That's very kind, but if
it's all the same to you,

188
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,475
- we'll stay out here.
- Fair play.

189
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,839
The trouble is, a very good friend
of mine is being held by Petre Sava,

190
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,460
the bloke you nicked
the Picasso from.

191
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:32,259
Now, it's a long story,
but now he thinks we got it.

192
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,960
- And why would he think that?
- Because we told him we did.

193
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,959
Yeah. We were trying
to sell him a fake.

194
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,500
- We're grifters.
- Yeah. It's what we do.

195
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,799
We read about the
Picasso being nicked,

196
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,880
so we had a copy made
to sell to a private collector,

197
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,379
one who wouldn't
ask too many questions.

198
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,160
If they'd read about it being
stolen, they'd believe it was real.

199
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:48,859
Exactly.

200
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,400
Trouble is, the collector we
took it to, it was paid to Sava,

201
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:52,499
who was the one
you'd nicked it from.

202
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,460
Which he wasn't very happy
about, as you can imagine.

203
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,138
It's a beautiful story, and
I'm getting all misty-eyed,

204
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:58,739
but what's any this
got to do with us?

205
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,638
Well, err...
If you give us the real Picasso,

206
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,939
the one that you nicked from Sava,

207
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,320
we can go and get our mate back.

208
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,400
Well, let's just say that
we had this painting,

209
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:13,599
not that I'm saying that
we do, you understand...

210
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,160
But he's your friend, not ours.
So what's in it for us?

211
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,839
Well, to be honest, I haven't thought
that bit through. What do you want?

212
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,760
Don't want anything.

213
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,999
I tell you what, 20 grand and I'll
nick it straight back for you.

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,020
You know, just for the
sheer brass neck of you,

215
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,419
I'm tempted to help you out.

216
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,279
And I do love a grifter.
Especially a pretty one.

217
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,319
- But it's already been moved on.
- Where? - Oh, I can't tell you that.

218
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,039
- You have to.
- Ash, is it? - Yeah.

219
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,319
Ash.

220
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,799
I can't do it, son.

221
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
We've worked years
to build up a reputation

222
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,399
based on complete discretion.

223
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,460
I can't piss that up the wall
for a couple of grifters.

224
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:56,059
So my lips are sealed.

225
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,000
All right, what about if I
threatened to beat it out of you?

226
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,399
Then I would respect that.

227
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,219
And me and my brother Neil here, would
defend ourselves as best we could,

228
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,359
by ripping your head from the
rest of your body and eating it.

229
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,879
Fair enough, just asking.

230
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,160
You have a nice day.

231
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,678
So, looks like we're
back to square one.

232
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,479
- No, not exactly, now we know
who stole it. - Yeah, but not who for.

233
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,079
- We still don't know where it is.
- Any news from the Old Bill, Albert?

234
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,358
It seems we know
more than they do.

235
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:41,359
What if the McCrary brothers
haven't delivered it yet?

236
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,600
We could just watch the house and
wait for them to make a move, right?

237
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,320
What if they're delivering
it tomorrow or next week?

238
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,719
We've only got four hours left.

239
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,399
What about Petre Sava?

240
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,540
Well, I did some digging
about, like you said.

241
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,439
Mickey was right about him
being a high-end art collector.

242
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,479
His private collection would rival
most European galleries.

243
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,180
The last we knew, he owned
half a dozen nightclubs

244
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:01,779
in London, so he was
bound to be a bit dodgy.

245
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,860
- Well, that's a good thing.
- Yeah. Until you find out how dodgy.

246
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,719
- Human trafficking... - Aah.
- ..Class A drug distribution,

247
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,199
and a protection racket
that started in Romania,

248
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,639
and has now spread
over eight European cities.

249
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,120
We need to get Mickey
out of there.

250
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,759
So what did you do with
the black guy?

251
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,839
He's in the boot of my car.

252
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,799
- Can he breathe?
- Sure.

253
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,840
At least I think so.

254
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,520
If they don't bring me
my painting...

255
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,000
..you think we should kill him,
or just cut some bits off?

256
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,040
Or both?

257
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,880
Both is good.

258
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,879
They don't cut people up too
much in the West, you know.

259
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,559
They don't kill them very much,
either. They "beat up".

260
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,559
But if you just "beat up,"
they get better,

261
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,480
they find some friends,
and then they come back.

262
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,319
If you cut bits off and post them to
their friends, this doesn't happen.

263
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,679
No. It's more efficient.

264
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,200
Exactly.

265
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,519
So, both it is.

266
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,600
You cut...

267
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,320
..I kill.

268
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,200
THUMPING

269
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,199
- Where's Mickey? - He's being held
hostage by a Romanian gangster

270
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,559
who won't release him until we find
a painting of a cat in a garden.

271
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,879
Yeah, right, yeah.

272
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,080
EDDIE CHUCKLES

273
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,999
You crack me up, you lot.

274
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,140
Very vivid imaginations,
as my mum used to say.

275
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:39,039
Mind you, you probably
need them in your line of work.

276
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,420
Cheers, Eddie. Look, give us a couple
of minutes, will you? We're thinking.

277
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:44,640
I thought I could hear something.
Oh, you had a phone call.

278
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,999
- Nice lady... Molly? - Dolly.
- Dolly. That's it.

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,480
She said she's got what you want,

280
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:53,799
only you have to send the
cute one, whatever that means.

281
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,759
No way.

282
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,839
Oh... No way.

283
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,800
No way!

284
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,639
No...

285
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,719
..way.

286
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,519
JAZZ MUSIC IN BACKGROUND

287
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,400
Ta-daa!

288
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,279
I didn't know if you liked
red or white,

289
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,959
so I brought one of each. Oh.

290
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,320
Ha-ha...

291
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,040
SHE CHUCKLES

292
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,519
It was horrible.

293
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,999
- So, did you actually have to?
- I don't want to talk about it.

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,879
Oh...

295
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,800
No, of course not.

296
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,400
She took her teeth out.

297
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,639
SNORTS

298
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,920
So, did she say anything at all?

299
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,000
Take a deep breath, Sean.

300
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,960
It might help to make
the pictures go away.

301
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,278
Petre Sava bought A
Small Cat ln The Garden

302
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,279
by Picasso at an auction in Kensington.

303
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,540
He outbid a private collector
called Matthew Fairchild,

304
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,239
who's an investment banker,

305
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,220
and happens to be the
father of Louise Fairchild,

306
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,519
whose married name is Holmes.

307
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,620
Should we know her?

308
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,319
No, but you might've
heard of her husband.

309
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,519
- Harry Holmes!
- The Harry Holmes?

310
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,800
'Fraid so.

311
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,040
It's all right. It's all right,
calm down. Calm down.

312
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,960
Now, I understand
you're not a grass...

313
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,600
..and I admire that in a man,
I really do.

314
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,640
I need you to open up for me.

315
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,920
One way...or another.

316
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,100
When Harry Holmes found
out it was Petre Sava

317
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:39,799
who beat his father-in-law
to the painting,

318
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,879
- he wasn't happy. It hurt his
pride a bit. - I bet it did.

319
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,558
I heard he was like a
dog with two whatsits

320
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,759
when he married
into the upper classes.

321
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,020
He's always fancied hunting,
shooting and fishing.

322
00:20:49,021 --> 00:20:50,819
So the painting's about impressing

323
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,560
- the new in-laws?
- Seems like it.

324
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,060
Then maybe those in-laws
are one of the reasons

325
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,059
that Harry hasn't got
his own hands dirty

326
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,540
in order to get the painting back.

327
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:01,039
He paid the McCrary brothers
to steal it for him instead.

328
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,620
- That's what Dolly said. - And you're
sure that wasn't just pillow talk?

329
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,180
So on one side we've got a violent
Eastern European gangster,

330
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,779
and on the other,
a homicidal maniac?

331
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,639
- That's about the strength of it.
- So what shall we do?

332
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,380
Sensible thing would
be call the Old Bill,

333
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:19,179
tell 'em what happened and
throw ourselves on their mercy.

334
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,800
- We're not going to do that, right?
- No.

335
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:23,399
Which leaves us with
one other option.

336
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,920
Which is?

337
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,020
To steal the painting back
from Harry Holmes.

338
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,799
This is the home of
Matthew Fairchild,

339
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,479
father-in-law of Harry Holmes,

340
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,800
who paid the McCrery brothers to
steal the Picasso from Petre Sava.

341
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,519
I still can't believe
you got it back.

342
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,879
It's family, innit?

343
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,480
I know someone who's getting
a special treat later.

344
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,319
Now Fairchild's already a collector,
so the security is a bit nifty.

345
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,738
- That's comforting.
- Yes, they got CCTV, weight sensor pads,

346
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:54,639
motion detectors, heat imaging
systems and laser webs.

347
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,219
That's if you can get past the
two killer dogs in the grounds.

348
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,240
I hate dogs.

349
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,080
Luckily, although the
system's state of the art,

350
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,579
it was designed
by Fairchild himself.

351
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,220
How does that help us?

352
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:06,120
Systems like this are only
as good as their design,

353
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,719
and he's made a very common,
but simple mistake.

354
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,758
- Which is?
- Basically it's a domestic system,

355
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,459
and like most domestic alarm systems,

356
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,019
it's designed on the assumption
that a theft would take place

357
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,019
either when the place is empty
or at night under cover of darkness.

358
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,780
Which means when they're
home during the day,

359
00:23:21,781 --> 00:23:23,479
the alarms are switched off.

360
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,420
- Exactly, Albert.
- Because who would be

361
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:26,819
stupid enough to break into a house

362
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,400
in broad daylight
when everyone's at home?

363
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,119
'OK, so this is all about timing.

364
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,439
'Everything on cue,
like a ballet.

365
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,719
'Firstly, let's make sure the dogs
get their sleeping pills.

366
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,360
'They'll last about 20 minutes.'

367
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,480
Three, two, one.

368
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,400
'Dogs are asleep.
I'm moving into position.'

369
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,500
Albert, you set?

370
00:23:58,501 --> 00:23:59,699
Ready.

371
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,540
Emma?
Sean?

372
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,420
Ready.

373
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,259
- Ready.
- 'OK.'

374
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,060
Go!

375
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,680
POLICE SIREN APPROACHES

376
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,159
Hello, madam. We're investigating
a stolen painting.

377
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,520
What are you doing? We need
to search the property.

378
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:46,800
What's going on?

379
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,759
I don't know.

380
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,759
I've got your number, fella!
I'll be straight onto the station!

381
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,640
But I think
we should get out of here.

382
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,279
Yeah. I'm with you.

383
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,920
No, look!

384
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,319
This is it, I've had enough!

385
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,280
All right, come on.

386
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,639
Calm down.

387
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,519
Don't you tell me
to calm down!

388
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,599
All right, thanks, Nigel, don't
forget I owe you a big cigar.

389
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,560
A good one?
Yeah, thanks, bye, bye.

390
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,839
All right, the police
have been tipped off,

391
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,159
they've seized the painting and
they've arrested Harry Holmes.

392
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,020
- Is that good or bad?
- Well, it can't be good, can it?

393
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,019
Wait! That's exactly what it is.

394
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,520
- How? - If the police have it,
Sava was the rightful owner.

395
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:32,019
They'll give him back the painting.

396
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,580
- He'll let Mickey go. - Job done.
- Eduardo, refreshments, please.

397
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,319
PHONE RINGS

398
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,519
Hello?

399
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,600
Yes, Nigel!

400
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,980
I see. All right, thanks for taking the
time to call me back, I appreciate it.

401
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,359
- They've released Harry Holmes.
- That was quick!

402
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,399
Well, they found the painting
in the house and it was fake.

403
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,399
- What?! - That ain't possible.
We know it was the original,

404
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,399
he had it nicked from Sava,
who bought it at the auction.

405
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,100
He wouldn't have angry
enough to kidnap Mickey

406
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:04,199
and hung Ash upside
down if all he'd lost a fake!

407
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,840
So if the one Harry had was a fake,
where's the real one?

408
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,320
Drinks up.

409
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,719
"Oh, thank you very much, Eddie"
"It's a pleasure to serve you..."

410
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,680
"Yeah, thank you very much"

411
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,039
- Doesn't make sense. - No.
- Let's think about this for a minute.

412
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,940
We have to assume that the
painting the McCrary brothers

413
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,839
nicked from Petre Sava
is the real Picasso.

414
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,760
- Agreed. - But by the time
it got to Harry Holmes

415
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:43,759
and his father-in-law,
it was a fake.

416
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,100
- Exactly.
- So they switched it?

417
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:48,299
- Yes, it can't be anything else.
- So if they passed on a fake to Harry,

418
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,600
they must've had another
buyer for the real one.

419
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:53,599
- Robbing bastards.
- The McCrarys have the real painting?

420
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,880
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

421
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,779
- They must have it!
- Or at least know where it is.

422
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,079
- The gate's wide open.
- Oh, we're too late!

423
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,240
There's no sign of life anywhere...

424
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:05,260
- No, they're long gone.
- Of course they are.

425
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,959
If you're just about to
stitch up Harry Holmes,

426
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,480
you're not gonna hang
around where he can find you.

427
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:10,579
They must have moved out just
after we saw them, right?

428
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,620
They could be back in Glasgow by now.

429
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:15,119
- We're screwed.
- No, you mean Mickey is.

430
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,039
Wait, wait. If you were going to
give Harry Holmes a fake,

431
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,820
you're not going to
risk him spotting it, are you?

432
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,619
I mean, it'd have
to be near-perfect.

433
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,479
So - where would you go for
a near-perfect copy of a Picasso?

434
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,979
- A girl's got to earn a living!
- But why didn't you tell us, Dolly?

435
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,139
Well, I didn't know
there was a connection!

436
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,699
It's the flaming cat in the wotsit,
the painting we was asking you about!

437
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,740
Yeah, but I can't keep
track of everything,

438
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,239
I'm not an accountant,
I'm an artist.

439
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,500
All right, all right.
So...step by step, right?

440
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,579
You did the fake
for the McCrarys, right?

441
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,539
- Maybe.
- Dolly! Stop messing about!

442
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,899
Are you going to let him
speak to me like that?

443
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,099
Eh?

444
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,219
I thought what
we had was special.

445
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,179
We didn't have anything!

446
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,659
You touched my Mabel!

447
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,659
- What? - That-That is what
she calls her ferret.

448
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,839
- Ferret?
- Yes, she keeps it in the khazi.

449
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,959
I don't let just anyone
touch my Mabel.

450
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,000
Dolly!

451
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, yeah,
all right, all right.

452
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,039
I made the McCrarys a fake,

453
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,599
and they said that they'd got
a buyer, but he was a muppet

454
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,160
and he'd never know the difference.

455
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:26,839
Yeah, well, that
"muppet" is Harry Holmes.

456
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,120
Oh. That's not good.

457
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:31,319
No, it's not, is it?
So I need you to tell me

458
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,160
what the McCrarys were
doing with the real Picasso.

459
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,199
They did say something
about a new buyer.

460
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,279
Who?

461
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,439
I don't know.

462
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,919
- Did they say anything at all?
Mention any names? - No.

463
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,039
OK, right, well, the, er,
the fake...

464
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,919
so, when you'd finished it,
did they collect it from here?

465
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,519
- No. - So how did you
get it to them?

466
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,239
I had to parcel it up
and send it in a cab.

467
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,960
Right.
Where to?

468
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,279
- I don't remember.
- Dolly! This is important.

469
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,319
Look, it's all this pressure!

470
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,519
I can't think straight with
you all looking at me!

471
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,999
- Would it help if we all just
looked away? - Yes. Except him.

472
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,559
Oh, come on, Dolly!

473
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,239
Oh. Oh!

474
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,880
Maybe a gin might do it.

475
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,279
It helps me to relax.

476
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,719
What do we have with it?

477
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,880
More gin.

478
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,720
- Go.
- Thank you.

479
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,959
It was a hotel.

480
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,519
Good. Which one?

481
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,360
Up west.

482
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,040
Name.

483
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,279
Have another gin.

484
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,359
- She's no use to us if she passes
out, is she? - I am here, you know!

485
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,519
I could, er...

486
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,720
I could book us a room
while I was there.

487
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,040
It was the Goodridge
on the South Bank.

488
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,480
See if they've got a four-poster!

489
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,880
Is he still alive?

490
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,380
HE GRUNTS IN PAIN

491
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,680
Yes, boss.

492
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,479
You know your friends have two
hours to return with my painting.

493
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,480
If they are late, we cut off something
every ten minutes until they get here.

494
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,359
If they are not here in two hours,

495
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,959
we kill whatever is left.

496
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,720
What do you think of that?

497
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,119
Do you want me to take his gag off?
So he can tell you what he thinks?

498
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,360
No, no.

499
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,039
I'm a people person,
it was a rhetorical question,

500
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,680
I know what he thinks.

501
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,719
You do?

502
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,320
He is thinking he hopes his friends
come before we cut anything off.

503
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,879
Oh.

504
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,520
Then maybe he's thinking about what
we will cut off, and in what order.

505
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,160
True?

506
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,480
- Do you think they're still here?

507
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:45,079
- Albert, do you know the concierge?
- Yes. Anthony...

508
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,520
Excuse me for a moment.

509
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,418
I thought Dolly sent the
fake painting here.

510
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:50,419
Yes, because the McCrary
brothers needed a fake

511
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,840
to give to Harry Holmes,
not the real one.

512
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:54,500
- So it means the real one could be here?
- There's only one way to find out.

513
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,759
All right.
They're staying overnight,

514
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,879
they've booked a car tomorrow
morning to go to the airport.

515
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,920
And right now,
they're in the bar.

516
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,439
They don't look like they've
got anything with them.

517
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,439
- What room are they in, Albert?
- 624.

518
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,880
They've seen me and Ems,
so we'll check the room,

519
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:24,920
you keep an eye on 'em, give us
a heads up if they move. All right.

520
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,200
- We haven't got a lot of time.
- You go that way. - Yeah.

521
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,280
CHATTER AND LAUGHTER

522
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,400
It's not here.

523
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,100
I'm making a real
pig's ear of this, aren't I?

524
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,599
All those times Mickey's bailed us out,

525
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,000
I can't even find a painting.

526
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:17,999
We're gonna find it,
it's just a matter of time.

527
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
Time we haven't got.
It's less than an hour now.

528
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,479
Know what? I'd rather get tooled up,
go to Sava's and take me chances.

529
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,759
- You can't do that.
- Yeah, well, I can't do this either.

530
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,720
It's a setback, but come on,
you're just as smart as Mickey.

531
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,119
Right. The McCrary brothers
are still downstairs.

532
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,199
Let's just go and
try to talk to them again.

533
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,000
We can get through this.
Let's go.

534
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,880
Now, that's clever.

535
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,880
See?
I told you we'd get it!

536
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,880
Who the hell are you?

537
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,640
CHATTER AND LAUGHTER

538
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,599
So let me get this straight.

539
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,919
Sava is holding your mate
until you bring him this. Yeah.

540
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,220
And he doesn't know it was me
who nicked the painting?

541
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:41,119
He thinks it was you.

542
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,239
HE CHUCKLES

543
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,679
Sounds like you're up shit creek and
left the paddle at home, sunshine.

544
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,560
And I have had a right result.

545
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,639
Just tell me one thing.

546
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,719
How did you know it was here?

547
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,999
We didn't. We just found the
McCrarys and hoped for the best.

548
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,319
Yeah, well those two
stitched me right up.

549
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,599
Didn't just sell me a moody
painting,

550
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,119
they made me look like a prat
in front of my wife's family.

551
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,160
Where are they?

552
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:10,080
No idea, there was no-one in
the room when we got here.

553
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,780
All right, seems to me you
two haven't done me any harm,

554
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,679
you've got nothing I need,

555
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,320
and you've got enough
to worry about. So get out.

556
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,360
Go on, sling your hook
before I change my mind.

557
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,520
We can't do that.

558
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,479
- Oh, yeah?
- No.

559
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,719
Without the painting, Petre Sava's
not gonna let our mate go.

560
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,599
So, I don't care who you are.

561
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
I ain't leaving without it.

562
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,320
And that's your final word?

563
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,160
Yeah, it is.

564
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,759
No, don't!

565
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,920
HE GRUNTS IN PAIN

566
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,800
Oohh...

567
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,560
Ash.
That wasn't very smart.

568
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,720
So have we got a plan B?

569
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,999
Well, it's more like
plan A revisited. Eh?

570
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,200
Harry will take the painting back
to his father-in-law's like a hero.

571
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,699
And we've got a plan in place
to steal it back from there.

572
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,999
- Clever. - Yeah, more importantly, we
need Harry back at the house pronto,

573
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,060
and finding the McCrary boys
will only slow him down.

574
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,919
So let's make sure
he has to leave now.

575
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,840
FIRE ALARM RINGS

576
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,999
Right.

577
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,160
Like a ballet, remember?

578
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,800
- We all set?
- Ready.

579
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,760
Set.

580
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,360
I'm ready.

581
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,599
Right.

582
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,720
Go!

583
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,559
And you're sure it's definitely
the real one this time?

584
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,719
Oh, yeah. Ooh, I love you
so much, I could burst.

585
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,440
DOORBELL RINGS

586
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,600
I'll get it.

587
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,799
Hello?

588
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,199
Hi, I'm really sorry, but my Bobby
has just run into your garden.

589
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,599
- Bobby?
- He's a white Bichon Frise.

590
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,519
- Oh. Only I was worried in case
you had dogs. - We do!

591
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,279
Oh.

592
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,039
No. Um...

593
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,799
Bobby! Darling, come on!

594
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,360
Wait, I'll come with you.

595
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,040
THEY CALL OUT

596
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,799
OK, two in the viewing room.

597
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
'Time to split 'em up.'

PHONE RINGS

599
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,440
Bobby! Bobby!

600
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,399
Hello? Fairchild.

601
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,919
Paul Holland from New York.

602
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,959
'We met at an awful meet and
greet in London last month.'

603
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,080
You do remember?

604
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,799
We've been through here
twice before.

605
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,200
He could be under
any of these bushes. Bobby!

606
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,920
OK, Ash, one left over.

607
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,040
CAR ALARM STARTS

608
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,400
OK, Ash, good to go, mate.

609
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,319
ALARM STOPS

610
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,839
- There!
- What?

611
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,519
I heard something! This way!

612
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,240
Bobby!

613
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,440
Yes. Uh-huh. Yes.

614
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,360
'Which brings me to
my other point...'

615
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,680
REMOTE CAR LOCK BEEPS

616
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,160
Yes, of course,
I'd be interested in looking...

617
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,959
Yes, exactly.

618
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,599
You know, if you don't find
them in the first half...

619
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,919
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

620
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,919
You know, you might...
excuse me.

621
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,799
Oh.
Yes?

622
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,199
Time to go.

623
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,959
Oh, that's amazing. Oh,
thank you, darling, so much.

624
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,119
Yes, I'm coming back now.
All right.

625
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,879
He found his way home!
He's such a clever baby!

626
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,919
Oh, thank you so much for helping.

627
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,400
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Bye, bye! - Bye!

628
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,679
'..perhaps you can call me
at my office tomorrow,

629
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,159
'and I can draw out
some projections...'

630
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,439
Sorry, Matthew, I got the Senator on
the other line, I've got to take it.

631
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,640
I'll be in touch,
thank you so much.

632
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,840
Home, James, and don't spare
the horses!

633
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,719
You won't believe what I've
been doing in the garden.

634
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,999
I've been chasing...

635
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,040
Oh, no.

636
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,279
Yeah, I've got it.
Yeah, the real one.

637
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,479
The same place as you
left me in half an hour.

638
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,559
But if Mickey's not there,
the deal's off. ..OK.

639
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,439
Half hour.

640
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,559
- Well? - All set. We'll meet back
at the warehouse in half an hour.

641
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,119
We give 'em the real painting,
they give us Mickey.

642
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,059
- But can we trust them? - The honest
truth is, Albert, I don't know.

643
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,660
What if Harry realises it was us?

644
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:05,359
- I don't know that either.
- But Ash, what happens if...

645
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,000
Let's get Mickey back first, and worry
about everything else later, yeah?

646
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,899
Sounds like a plan.

647
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,880
Yeah, well, first,
I need a drink.

648
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,640
Set 'em up.

649
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,840
There you are!

650
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,399
Mad Dolly told us
where to find you.

651
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,559
Oh?

652
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,079
That was you at the hotel, wasn't it?

653
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,159
Hotel?

654
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,200
I saw you leaving.

655
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,679
Just passing, were you?

656
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,159
That's right, yeah, we erm...

657
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,799
Well, we found out where you were

658
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,519
and we thought we'd try again,
you know, to convince you to...

659
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,079
let us take the painting.

660
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,279
That's what I thought.

661
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,039
So it was you guys that
set off the alarm, was it?

662
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,380
- Yeah, yeah, we...
- What did I tell you?

663
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,440
That's why we're here, we
wanted to say thank you!

664
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,560
Eh?

665
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,639
Look, I don't know why you
hit the alarm when you did,

666
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,060
but if you hadn't, we'd
have just waltzed up there

667
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:20,959
and found Harry Holmes
in our room.

668
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,359
Yeah, well, you know,
don't mention it.

669
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,959
So what happened?

670
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,439
You found us and then you saw Harry
and his goons there too, right?

671
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,600
That's right, yeah.
So...we legged it.

672
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:35,519
- Only we didn't want to drop you
in it, so... - So we hit the alarm.

673
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,880
Look. All I know is if it wasn't
for you guys we would be screwed.

674
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,940
So, thank you.

675
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:46,279
It's a pleasure, I hope
you'd do the same for us.

676
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,599
Oh, absolutely!

677
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,719
Well, there you go. We'd love
to stay and have a beer with you,

678
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,439
but we have a flight to catch.

679
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,480
We've got to get home and make
a start on spending this.

680
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,599
400 grand...for the painting.

681
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,759
The painting?

682
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,160
The Picasso.

683
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,679
We sold Harry one of
the duds Dolly made.

684
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,199
- Yeah, I heard. That's why he was
looking for you. - Oh, no doubt.

685
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,720
But we also had another buyer lined
up for the real one. German guy.

686
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:30,080
Wait. You said you sold
"one of the duds" to Harry?

687
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,479
So you sold a dud
to the German too?

688
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,319
No, no, he got the real thing.
Bid the highest you see.

689
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,479
No, we had Dolly make two duds.
We sold one to Harry,

690
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,380
and the other we were going to sell
to some Aussie guy in the hotel bar,

691
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:48,779
but he was a no show.

692
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,679
Yeah, yeah, but you can't
have sold the real one,

693
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,759
because Harry
found it in your room.

694
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,639
He would have been pretty
disappointed when he got home.

695
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,359
- Eh? - Did the deal with
the German guy this afternoon,

696
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,199
long before Harry found us.

697
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,039
If he found a painting in our
room, it was the other dud.

698
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,440
Shit, I think we actually
hung it up on the wall.

699
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:10,239
We were leaving it as
a wee present for the hotel.

700
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,120
Look, like I said, we just came
here to say thank you.

701
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,879
Oh, by the way, how did, er... How
did things pan out with your friend?

702
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,759
Oh, well, we're, er...
We're still working on it.

703
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,879
Well, good luck with that.

704
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,440
Cheers.

705
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,880
DOOR CLOSES

706
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,199
So we stole another fake?

707
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,440
You told Sava we had half an hour.
We've got 15 minutes.

708
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,800
So what do we do now?

709
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,360
Here you are, mate.

710
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,560
CAR ENGINE STARTS

711
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,319
When you live outside the law,
on the fringes of society,

712
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,039
you're always going to have
days like this.

713
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,760
What you might call
a bad day in the office.

714
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,439
Well, the thing is not to panic.

715
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,959
Because people like this lot,
they're like dogs,

716
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,800
they can smell fear.

717
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,439
So the trick is to make them think
you know something they don't.

718
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,960
That way they'll generally
hold off killing you

719
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,040
while they try and
work out what it is.

720
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,159
You have brought my painting?

721
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,120
- You brought my friend?
- Painting first.

722
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,540
Friend first or there's no deal.

723
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:16,439
I don't think you're in a
position to negotiate, do you?

724
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,639
If you believe that, it could be
the worst mistake you ever made.

725
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,560
I see my friend...
you see your painting.

726
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,680
Now your turn.

727
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,319
Right. Who's got my painting?

728
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,860
This is none of your
business, Harry.

729
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:25,159
Well, I'm making it
my business, Boris,

730
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,659
I've been dancing around
you lot for too long.

731
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,559
My name is not Boris.

732
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,239
It is when I'm talking to you.

733
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,019
- You know, calling me
Boris is racist. - Tough.

734
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,279
Er, excuse me, can we, er...
Can we get on with this, please?

735
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,300
What are you doing here?

736
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:41,999
What do you think
I'm flaming doing here?

737
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,879
I've come to swap this painting...

738
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,500
for my mate.

739
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,959
- That is my painting.
- No. - My painting.

740
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,959
I nicked it, fair and square.
And now I'm getting it back.

741
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,600
That's enough!

742
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,679
- Who you shouting at?
- You!

743
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,360
The pair of you!

744
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,799
Have you never heard of
honour amongst thieves?

745
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,760
Some kind of nodding appreciation
amongst your peers?

746
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,199
You're like a couple
of five-year-olds.

747
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,359
"Please, Miss, he's nicked
my painting." It's pathetic.

748
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,919
- And I've had it with both of you!
- Get the painting.

749
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,440
Ah, ah, ah!

750
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,679
I've had a gun shoved up me
hooter, been hung upside down

751
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,439
and kicked up in the air.

752
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,279
I've been threatened
by at least three nationalities

753
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,580
while running around
half of London chasing

754
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:47,079
some stupid picture of a cat
in someone's back garden

755
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:52,039
that looks like it was done by
a three-year-old on a sugar rush.

756
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,599
I've been lied to,
cheated and generally abused

757
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,879
just because me and my mate here
were trying to earn an honest crust

758
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,319
when Rasputin here
went and kidnapped him.

759
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,640
- Hey. Rasputin is worse than Boris.
- I said, shut it!

760
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,940
Now, I don't know
whose painting this is

761
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:13,639
and, to be quite honest,
I don't give a flying toss!

762
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,720
- I've had a very bad day!
- Do you know who you're talking to?

763
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,640
Never mind who I'm talking to.

764
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,160
You ought to worry about who we
are, son. We're grifters. Yeah.

765
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,959
This bloke over here.
He's sold the Eiffel Tower,

766
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,980
the Palace Of Westminster
and the Sydney Opera House.

767
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:38,239
We broke banks, companies
and political parties.

768
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,599
We took on the mafia in Las Vegas

769
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,440
and we made the London Special
Branch look like the Keystone Cops.

770
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,460
So never mind about you two
threatening us!

771
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,120
Now, I'm threatening you!

772
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,439
We're going to make you our hobby.

773
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,940
Spend sleepless nights
working out how to

774
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,139
take away everything
from you, every penny.

775
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,039
It won't be just a sodding
painting you have to worry about,

776
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,320
you'll be working out where
you're going to sleep at night.

777
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,439
Because we're going to pick you clean.

778
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,880
We'll strip every bit
of flesh off the bone.

779
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,439
Nice speech.
I got just one question.

780
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,920
Yeah, what's that?

781
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,800
How are you lot going to
do that, when you're dead?

782
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,080
Very good.

783
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,559
Now, give me my painting.

784
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,600
No. No. You give
me my painting.

785
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,439
Some people never listen, do they?

786
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,919
I tell you what...

787
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,200
you can sort it out
amongst yourselves.

788
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,600
Get it round the side!
Yeah, that's it.

789
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,600
Watch what you're doing!

790
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,399
Don't damage it!

791
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,839
You didn't phone, you didn't write.

792
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,800
Sorry, mate,
I've been a bit tied up.

793
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,119
Is that who I think it is?

794
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,559
Harry Holmes, yeah.

795
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,439
Good job he turned up.

796
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,320
Yeah, well...I phoned him.

797
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,959
- You phoned him?
- Yeah.

798
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,400
So what do we do now?

799
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,799
IN SCOTTISH ACCENT:
Hello. Harry?

800
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,420
Would you be interested
to know who the McCrary

801
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,719
boys were working for when
they double-crossed you?

802
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,320
Aye, I do know.
Have you got a pen?

803
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,879
Just watch the painting, will ya?

804
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,679
They don't seem to like
each other very much.

805
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,439
No, well, I er...
I phoned the other one 'an all.

806
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,479
IN RUSSIAN ACCENT: Harry Holmes.
Yes, he cheated a friend of mine.

807
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,439
So when I found out
he stole your painting,

808
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,079
I thought it right to call you.

809
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,940
And I phoned the Old Bill
in case it went pear-shaped.

810
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,039
They'll be here any minute.

811
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,480
I've got it!

812
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,279
- Oh.
- Is that the real Picasso?

813
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,200
Oh, no, no.
No, that's a fake.

814
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,279
- Guys. Can I... Can I ask a question?
- Yeah, yeah.

815
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,879
- I mean, I don't want to sound
ungrateful or anything. - No, it's OK.

816
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,199
Wouldn't it have been simpler
to get the real painting?

817
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,680
SIRENS WAIL IN THE DISTANCE

818
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,840
It's OK.

819
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,799
Cheers, Ed.
Thank you.

820
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,519
So no-one's looking for us?

821
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,459
No. No, you see, they both thought
that the original

822
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,360
was damaged in the
fight at the warehouse.

823
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:01,320
But neither Petre Sava nor Harry
Holmes could afford to lose face.

824
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,439
So the only way they could save
face was to have a fake each.

825
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,239
That way, they could both say
they won and honour is restored.

826
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,559
And they all get to live
happily ever after.

827
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,359
Down. Ah.

828
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,919
Yeah, well, you know,
happy as they can be.

829
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,679
Perfect.

830
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,919
It seems the only winners
are the McCrary boys.

831
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,400
Tell me about it. They just
walked off with 400 grand.

832
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:28,919
Whoa, they might get to go
with all the money

833
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,620
but we got something
much more precious.

834
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:33,119
- We got Mickey back.
- Oh, yes, that's true.

835
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,439
- Yeah. Ah. Thanks, guys.
- You can't put a price on friendship.

836
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,860
But if you could, it'd
be about 400 grand.

837
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:41,559
Ignore him - he was beside
himself when you were gone.

838
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,479
He was taking all the blame,
he was full of self-loathing.

839
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,239
It was heartbreaking to watch.
It was. Yeah, yeah.

840
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,580
We may have not made any money,
but apart from the odd bruise,

841
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,279
- everything turned out OK.
- Yes, it did.

842
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,940
Ash, I've got to ask you,
did you really lose it

843
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:55,639
with those gangsters
at the warehouse?

844
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,799
We hadn't got a lot of
options at that point,

845
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,760
so I thought I'd do
a bit of Mickey waffle.

846
00:55:59,879 --> 00:56:02,879
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

847
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,200
- "Mickey waffle"?
- Yeah, you know that thing

848
00:56:06,299 --> 00:56:07,799
where you talk a lot but
don't actually say anything.

849
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,199
Sorry, no, I do not "waffle".

850
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,820
- You do a bit.
- When?

851
00:56:11,919 --> 00:56:13,919
Usually when you know you're
wrong but you won't admit it.

852
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,180
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but
that's far from waffling,

853
00:56:17,279 --> 00:56:19,879
that's just my way of
presenting a reasoned argument.

854
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,599
A way of putting forward the
facts, which in the main, Ash,

855
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,759
I'm sorry to say, is
something you fail to do.

856
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,780
You prefer to use
emotional rhetoric

857
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,879
littered with expletives
to make your point.

858
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,440
No, it's true, it's true.

859
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,199
That was not "waffling".

860
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,080
I wish you'd left me
in the boot now.

861
00:56:36,081 --> 00:56:37,840
Well, it can be arranged.

862
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:40,339
ED: I brought you tomorrow's papers.
- Oh, cheers.

863
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,640
That was that Dolly bird again.

864
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:44,439
I was going to give you a
shout but you were waffling.

865
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,840
- Cheers, Ed. I wasn't waffling.
- Course not.

866
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,080
Erm...this Dolly...she sounds
a bit of all right on the phone.

867
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:54,139
What's she like?

868
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,079
- Oh, now...now...she is special.
- Yeah? Is she a looker?

869
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,799
Oh...definitely.

870
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,980
- Is she a looker?

871
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,479
- Got a lovely set of teeth,
hasn't she, Sean? - Amazing.

872
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,759
Only we had a little bit of a chat.
We got on like a house on fire.

873
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,039
Think she was flirting a bit
when she, er...

874
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,980
when she rang earlier,
you know, she said she

875
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,479
liked me accent and that so,
er...so you know...

876
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,879
- might have a crack at it like.
- "It"?

877
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,919
Yeah, yeah, you
don't mind, do you?

878
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,079
I don't want to tread
on anyone's toes.

879
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,559
No. Good for you,
you go for "it".

880
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,599
She's invited me round for a drink.

881
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:34,879
Yeah? Edward.
This is a match made in heaven.

882
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,439
You think so?

883
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,959
- Absolutely.
- You knock yourself out, son.

884
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,880
Cheers, guys. I'll let you
know how I get on.

885
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,400
- Do you think that was a bit cruel?
- Yeah. Probably.

886
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,199
Oh, listen to this.

887
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,879
It says here that a Mondrian was stolen
from a gallery in Central London,

888
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,120
and it's valued at £2.3 million.

889
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,360
Doesn't Tucker still
do fake Mondrians?

890
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,040
- It was a joke.
- Yeah!

891
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,000
- Should've seen your faces.
- Oi!

892
