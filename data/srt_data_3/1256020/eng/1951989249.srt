1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,810
I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,780
Well, you're the doctor, but I am constantly

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,680
hearing this annoying sound.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,180
Me, too.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,080
Is it a high-frequency whistle?

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,080
No, it's more of a relentless,

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,710
narcissistic drone.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,550
Yup, there's no inflammation at all, Sheldon.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,850
Then it must be a tumor.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,450
I Seriously doubt it.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,450
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,680
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,410
Is that possible? I used to get those all the time.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,150
Even in church.

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,110
Well if it is from a swirly, there something I can do.

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,980
Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot,

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,080
now you have a cootie shot!

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,010
I'm going to bed

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,880
Okay, I'll be right in.

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,110
It's not enough that she mocks me, but that isn't even

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,350
the correct procedure for a cootie shot.

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,180
Do you understand that Stephanie's not here

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,150
to treat your imaginary ailments?

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,050
How is it imaginary that I keep hearing

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,010
an octave above Middle C?

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,080
Is that imaginary?

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,380
I don't think so.

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,280
Good night.

29
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,850
Leonard,there's one more thing.

30
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,010
Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement,

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,550
I'm calling an emergency meeting.

32
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,610
No, you're not.

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
Leonard moves the meeting not occur.

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,410
Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails.

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,350
I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you

36
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,110
on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

37
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,510
Thank you.

38
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,610
That being said, we have to discuss

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,410
the implementation of the agreed upon "cohabitation" rider

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,750
whichas been activated now that

41
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,610
the two of you are living together.

42
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,070
We're not living together.

43
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,770
I beg to disagree

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,090
"A girlfriend shall be deemed

45
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,190
quote living with un-quote Leonard

46
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,010
when she has stayed over for A: ten consecutive nights,

47
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,510
or B:  more than nine nights in three week period,

48
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,030
or C: all the weekends of a given month

49
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,850
plus three weeknights.

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,810
That's absurd.

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,210
You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,910
Wait, I only initialed it

53
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,110
because I never thought it would happen!

54
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,610
I initialed another clause

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,380
naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

56
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,050
Hmm, yes, you did.

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,150
Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated:

58
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,350
In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having

59
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,380
two separate shelves and one communal shelf,

60
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,280
the three of us now get individual shelves

61
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,810
and the door becomes communal.

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,450
Next, apartment vacuuming shall be

63
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,810
increased from two to three times a week

64
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,680
to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells.

65
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,250
Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I'm given to understand

66
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,150
women have different needs, so, we'll have to discuss that.

67
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,980
I'm going to bed.

68
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,910
At least take this with you.

69
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,910
Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here...

70
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,180
and... here.

71
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,980
This states that she does not now

72
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,250
nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument.

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,310
Sure sounds like a tumor

74
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,150
pressing on the auditory nerve.

75
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,480
No, absolutely not.

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,770
It's not a big deal.

77
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,810
We have latex gloves.

78
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,880
I don't care what the symptoms are,

79
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,010
my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.

80
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,410
Hi, Sheldon.

81
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,310
Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

82
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,350
I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.

83
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,850
Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.

84
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,950
I heard you ask it over and over.

85
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,050
How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?

86
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,880
He did very nicely.

87
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,650
See? She's not offended.

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,580
And now you finally have an answer.

89
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,110
Out of coffee. Need coffee.

90
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,080
Oh, hello.

91
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,580
Hi! Stephanie, right?

92
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,050
Uh-huh. And-And- And you are?

93
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,180
Penny, I live across the hall.

94
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,310
I've heard a lot about you.

95
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,450
Really? Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,780
I haven't heard a thing about you.

97
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,210
Leonard?

98
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,450
Why haven't I heard a thing

99
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,610
about this woman who lives across the hall

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,080
and comes into your apartment in the morning...in her underwear?

101
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,310
She's heard about you because we're, you know,

102
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,610
involved and you haven't heard about her because...

103
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,310
I never slept with her, I swear!

104
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,480
In Leonard's defense, it wasn't for lack of trying.

105
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,410
Thank you, Sheldon.

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,750
You're welcome, Leonard.

107
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,150
Look, I'm just saying, um...

108
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,540
Penny is one of our many neighbors, you know,

109
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,910
and in our building,

110
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,210
neighbors come and go, it's very casual, no dress code.

111
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,240
In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,900
in my pajamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

113
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,270
Really?

114
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,460
I have never once been invited

115
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,450
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

116
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,550
She doesn't like you.

117
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,510
You have a gall bladder to remove and I have

118
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,610
to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so...

119
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,680
Well, it was very nice meeting you.

120
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,280
Nice to finally meet you, too.

121
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,350
And I'll see you tonight?

122
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,950
Okay, bye-bye.

123
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,530
What could I possibly have done

124
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,510
to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?

125
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,580
So, that's Stephanie, huh?

126
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,480
Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam?

127
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,380
You know, she seems very nice.

128
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,380
Oh, she is. She's terrific.

129
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,210
And she's proving to be a valuable roommate.

130
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,750
Roommate? You guys are living together?

131
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,080
Like hippies.

132
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,710
We're not living together.

133
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,380
Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?

134
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,980
We're not living together.

135
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,210
Are you sure?

136
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,050
How could I not be sure?

137
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,880
Well, let's find out.

138
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,010
Don't you think if a woman was living with me

139
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,410
I'd be the first one to know about it?

140
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,710
Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one to know about it.

141
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,680
Hmm, cute dresses.

142
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,080
I bet this looks great on you!

143
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,150
We're not living together.

144
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,410
Okay, hmm...

145
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,250
Scented candles, fuzzy slippers,

146
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,050
Ooh! Floral bed sheets?

147
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,980
We're not living together.

148
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,910
Okay, moving on.

149
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,880
Now, who are these guys at Disney World?

150
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,850
Uh, the big dog is Goofy,

151
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,880
but the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea.

152
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,910
We're not living together!

153
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,550
You're going to go down swinging, huh?

154
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,110
All right, well, we got your body lotion,

155
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,250
your InStyle Magazine, your jewelry box.

156
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,710
We're not--

157
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,910
Where's my Bat Signal?

158
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,350
You have a Bat Signal?

159
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,980
I did. It was right here.

160
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,450
She must've-- Oh, my God, we're living together.

161
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,110
Really? What was your first clue?

162
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,950
New pants?

163
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,610
Yeah, Sthanie got them for me.

164
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,950
Nice. Cotton?

165
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,610
Actually, I think it's more of wool, fire ant blend.

166
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,680
So, the girlfriend's buying clothes for you, huh?

167
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,250
Sounds serious.

168
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,580
It is actually.

169
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,050
In fact, I gave it a lot of thought

170
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,280
and I decided it was time for us to live together.

171
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,350
Ba Oh, Leonard, huge mistake.

172
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,650
There's a whole buffet of women out there and you're just

173
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,150
standing in the corner eating the same deviled egg

174
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,880
over and over again.

175
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,110
At least I have an egg. What do you have?

176
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,050
A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners.

177
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,670
See the blonde over there?

178
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,150
I can hit on her and you can't.

179
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,150
So, go hit on her.

180
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,010
She's not my type.

181
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,730
Too bad, 'cause she was checking you out before.

182
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,420
She was?

183
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,730
Of course not. Look at her.

184
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,550
I don't care what you guys think.

185
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,360
Stephanie and I are very happy living together.

186
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,010
I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now

187
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,680
to trade pants with me.

188
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,650
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

189
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,180
Hang on.

190
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,150
130 over 80. A little high.

191
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,680
We can attribute that to the stress

192
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,980
of sneaking past the security desk.

193
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,450
Where did you get the stethoscope

194
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,710
and the blood pressure cuff?

195
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,650
My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday.

196
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,950
She thought if I failed at theoretical physics

197
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,510
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

198
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,210
And by the way, the blood pressure cuff

199
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
is called a sphygmomanometer.

200
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,850
Thank you.

201
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,880
Didn't they teach you that in medical school?

202
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,350
I'm kinda busy here, Sheldon.

203
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,680
I understand.

204
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,750
All I need is for you to authorize these tests.

205
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,250
A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI,

206
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,910
anlectromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose.

207
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,510
Upper GI?

208
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,650
Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy.

209
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,610
Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm

210
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,280
was just going through the motions.

211
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,150
Go home, Sheldon.

212
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,880
Can I at least have the upper GI?

213
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,050
I already drank the barium!

214
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,780
Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?

215
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,380
Yeah, sure.

216
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,250
What are you washing? A crocodile?

217
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,210
No, the pants that Stephanie got me.

218
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,780
Oh, sweetie, you can't machinwash these.

219
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,850
They'll be ruined.

220
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,280
-Are you sure? -Absolutely.

221
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,940
Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

222
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,680
Are you guys having problems?

223
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,910
No, everything's fine.

224
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,780
Really?

225
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,710
Yeah. It's wonderful.

226
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,850
Okay, maybe this whole living together

227
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,820
happened kind of suddenly, but it's fine, it's great.

228
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,960
Okay, Leonard, honey, you know,

229
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,850
if you're uncomfortable with the way things are going,

230
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,080
you're allowed to say something.

231
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,150
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

232
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,310
Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.

233
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,850
No that doesn't sound right either.

234
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,710
Just tell her you need the relationship to move

235
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,550
at a pace that you both are comfortable with.

236
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,210
Yeah, I could say something like that to her.

237
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,250
I'll go do that.

238
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,410
Thank you.

239
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,550
Sure.

240
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,610
You have a really good grasp on this.

241
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,780
Maybe you could talk to her?

242
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,550
You're kidding, right?

243
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,450
No, but that's okay.

244
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,950
I'll go talk to her.

245
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,990
Want to come with?

246
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,640
Go!

247
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,250
Oh, no.

248
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,050
Whaa??

249
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,120
You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed.

250
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,650
I mean, I've never seen anything like it.

251
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,050
I knew it!

252
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,810
What do I do?!

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,810
You're going to need to stop talking immediately.

254
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,480
For how-- Dut-dut-dut.

255
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,650
Immediately.

256
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,280
Hey. Oh, hi, honey.

257
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,180
Sheldon.

258
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,480
What's going on?

259
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,710
I just performed a "Sheldonectomy."

260
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,080
Careful, if you don't get it all, it'll only come back worse.

261
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,350
Gotcha.

262
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,980
Listen, we need to talk.

263
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,910
Do we need to talk or "do we need to talk"?

264
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,510
I don't know what that means.

265
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,050
Okay, why don't you just tell me

266
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,410
what it is you have to tell me?

267
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,610
Okay, um, well, look, it's just that...

268
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,550
things between you and me have been going pretty quick.

269
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,010
And...?

270
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,150
It's just a little scary.

271
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,050
Well, yeah, but scary good, right?

272
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,710
Sure...

273
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,880
When is scary not good?

274
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,380
But... okay, um, I have feelings, right?

275
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,580
Okay, and it's perfectly okay

276
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,580
to express those feelings, right?

277
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,400
Of course honey why don't you tell me

278
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,910
what it is you're feeling?

279
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,980
Okay, well, I ju... I think it's important to remember

280
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,910
that we move at a pace that is our speed

281
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,850
and-- Oh, shoot, I had it!

282
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,250
Okay, how about this?

283
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,480
How about I tell you what I'm feeling?

284
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,510
What's that?

285
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,880
Really? Right now?

286
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,710
Why not?

287
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,780
I just ate, aren't you supposed to wait an hour?

288
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,380
I think that's for swimming.

289
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,410
Oh, okay.

290
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,850
I just hope I don't get cramps.

291
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,580
Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.

292
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,810
Thank you.

293
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,010
-Your pants are ruined. -Good.

294
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,510
So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?

295
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,310
Well, um, on one level, really, really well.

296
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,050
So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?

297
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,650
Not specifically,

298
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,610
but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.

299
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,580
Good, good. And then what?

300
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,080
And then, uh, the subject got changed somehow.

301
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,150
You had sex, didn't you?

302
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,780
Um... little bit.

303
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,850
What?

304
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,580
Nothing.

305
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,480
Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.

306
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,780
Yeah, it's all good.

307
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,980
Everything's going to work out.

308
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,080
One way or another.

309
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,250
come on, Leonard,

310
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,550
You are entitled to try and make

311
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,780
things go the way you want them to.

312
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,210
-Really? -Yes!

313
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,010
You don't always have to go along with what the woman wants.

314
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,850
What?

315
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,910
Nothing. Just... rethinking my whole life.

316
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,210
Okay, here's the thing.

317
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,850
I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she'll just dump me.

318
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,510
Well, it's a chance you have to take.

319
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,150
I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

320
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,550
Very comforting.

321
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,850
Okay, so what do I say to her?

322
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,210
I don't know.

323
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,850
I mean, what have women said to you

324
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,650
when they wanted to slow a relationship down?

325
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,110
I really like you,

326
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,510
but I want to see how things go with Mark?

327
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,950
Yeah, that'll slow it down.

328
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,780
I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.

329
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,810
What were you saying?

330
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,750
Oh, right, yeah, um...

331
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,610
So, Stephanie, here's the thing.

332
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,880
I really like you.

333
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,150
Oh, God, here comes the speech.

334
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,280
What speech?

335
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,010
"I really like you,

336
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,780
"but maybe we should spend a little less time together

337
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,350
"'cause I need my space

338
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,850
but I'll call you on Tuesday"

339
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,750
and then you never call me

340
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,295
so I call you,but you don't call me back

341
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:37,780
and then when I run into you at the coffee shop,

342
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,180
you pretend like you've been having problems

343
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,350
with your voice mail and I know that you're lying,

344
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,650
but I pretend like I don't care

345
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,810
even though I'm dying inside!

346
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,750
No!

347
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,980
No, no! I wasn't going to say any of that.

348
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,680
I was just going to say...

349
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,850
I really like you.

350
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,280
Oh, good!

351
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,480
'Cause I really like you, too.

352
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,550
Terrific.

353
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,810
Hey.

354
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,750
- Hey.- Hey.

355
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,450
nice sweater.

356
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,250
Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It's kind of fun.

357
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,150
It's got a big bird on it, dude.

358
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,910
Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part.

359
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,080
We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom,

360
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,480
and a dust ruffle, and a duvet,

361
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,310
and I don't even know what a duvet is,

362
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one,

363
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,650
but every time I talk to her about moving out,

364
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,180
she cries and we have sex.

365
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,250
You're lucky. With me, it's usually the other way around.

366
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,950
You know, if you can't talk to her,

367
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,550
why don't you just text her?

368
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,810
Isn't that kind of cowardly?

369
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,750
Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

370
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,280
It's true,

371
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,750
but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.

372
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,410
Sold.

373
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,450
"I think it would be better for our relationship

374
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,480
if you moved back to your place."

375
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,350
There. It's done.

376
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,110
Good for you.

377
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,750
Yeah, good for me. I'll never have sex again.

378
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,750
I was wrong.See ya.

379
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,610
Penny.

380
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
Penny.

381
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,350
Penny.

382
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,150
Sheldon?

383
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,810
COMPUTER: I have an inflamed larynx.

384
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,650
Okay?

385
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,680
COMPUTER: We're out of herbal tea. Do you have any?

386
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Okay, let me check.

387
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,580
COMPUTER: Some hiney would be nice, too.

388
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,780
Hiney?

389
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,010
COMPUTER: Honey.
