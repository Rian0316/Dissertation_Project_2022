{\an8}前情提要

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,094
U·N·欧文就是匿名
U·N·Owen is unknown.

3
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,147
我们必然有什么共同点
We must all have something in common.

4
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:08,107
有人认识我们所有人
Someone who knows us all.

5
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,179
是那首诗 就是那首诗 你们没发现吗?
It's the poem. It's the poem, don't you see?

6
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:13,123
不会有人来找我们的
No-one's coming for us. This is the end.

7
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,135
你喜欢雨果叔叔 对吧?
You like Uncle Hugo, don't you?

8
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:18,131
对 我爱上他了
I do. I am in love with him.

9
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,175
斧劈两半一命休 七个只剩六
One chopped himself in half and then there were six.

10
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:22,187
所以她说得对 和那首诗一样!
So she's right. It is the poem!

11
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,143
你和我都有犀利的头脑 我们应该待在一起
We have sharp minds. We should stay together.

12
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,163
房间是锁着的
It was locked.

13
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:31,139
所以一定有主钥匙
Which means there must be a master key.

14
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:34,099
钥匙可能在任何人手里
Any one of us could have had the key.

15
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,091
枪也可能在任何人手里
Any one of us could have the gun.

16
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:38,095
凶手不在外面
The killer is not out there.

17
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,183
凶手就在这
The killer is in here.

18
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:41,177
是我们中的一员
It is one of us.

无人生还 第三集

28
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:23,095
看西里尔现在多开心啊
Look how happy Cyril is now.

29
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:25,151
雨果总是能让人意想不到
Hugo always works wonders.

30
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:28,123
他是我见过的最出色的年轻人了
He is the most marvellous man.

31
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,111
他看起来人很好
He seems very nice.

32
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:34,115
在那种情况下 我真的想不到能有人像他这么体贴
I really can't imagine many would be as kind, under the circumstances.

33
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,109
什么情况?
What circumstances?

34
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,119
我丈夫去世的时候 我并不知道我已经怀孕了
Well, I had no idea I was pregnant when my husband died.

35
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,123
所以 雨果作为我丈夫的侄子 应该是他的继承人
So Hugo, as the nephew, stood to inherit.

36
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,167
可是当西里尔出生之后 雨果就没希望了 唉!
And when little Cyril popped out, that was it for Hugo's hopes. Hm!

37
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:52,143
他应该娶一个有钱人家的女孩 可以继承父亲财产的那种
What he needs is some rich girl loaded down with Daddy's money,

38
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:54,167
不过他是个浪漫的人
but he's a romantic.

39
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,167
想为了爱情而结婚
Wants to marry for love.

40
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:59,119
可是没钱的话 他怎么结婚?
But how can he when he doesn't have a penny?

41
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:02,185
克莱索恩小姐 爱情可是一种非常昂贵的追求
Love, Miss Claythorne, is a very costly pursuit.

42
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,131
哦 西里尔 真棒! 哦!
Oh, well done, Cyril! Oh!

43
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,181
我也过去和他们一起玩
I might go and play with them.

44
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,155
嗨
Ah, hello.

45
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:20,101
看起来有人是想给我们奖励呢 西里尔
Looks like we've got some reinforcements, Cyril.

46
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,187
准备好了吗 小家伙?
Ready, old thing?

47
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,123
准备? 我可不觉得克莱索恩小姐能打到球
Ready? I don't think Miss Claythorne can hit a ball.

48
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,121
- 女孩们真的不行的 雨果叔叔  - 那我们试试看吧
- Girls can't, Uncle Hugo.  - Well, we'll have to see.

49
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,131
哦 打中了!
Oh, shot!

50
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,151
过来! 快点 快点!
Over here! Quick, quick!

51
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:37,095
快啊 她都要跑完一整圈了 快过来
Quick, she's going to get all the way around. Come on now.

52
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,165
真棒! 就差一点了
Well done! Almost.

53
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:50,107
我们不能就这么坐着什么都不干!
We can't just sit here doing nothing!

54
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,107
那我们应该怎样?
What are we supposed to do?

55
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,127
在岩石上生火求救?
Light a fire on the headland, signal for help?

56
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,125
这种天气可不行
Not in this weather.

57
00:03:57,165 --> 00:04:00,127
她... 她要去哪里? 你要去哪?
Where's... where's she going? Where are you going?

58
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,103
去泡点茶 我一会就拿进来
To make tea. I'll bring it in.

59
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:05,187
你还要拿进来什么? 厨房里的刀?
What else are you going to bring in? A knife from the kitchen?

60
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,095
还是你藏起来的枪?
The gun from wherever you've hidden it?

61
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:09,187
你又要在茶里放什么?
And what are you going to be putting in the tea?

62
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,163
她会杀死我们所有人的!
She's going to wipe out all four of us!

63
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:14,127
我会在茶里放点柠檬
There'll be lemon in the tea.

64
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,187
我... 我不会拿刀进来 我也没有枪
I... I won't bring a knife and I don't have the gun.

65
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,183
就算我有 我也没法一下杀死你们所有人 不是吗?
Even if I did, I wouldn't be killing you all at the same time, would I?

66
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:22,187
- 我们凭什么信你?!  - 因为人是挨个死的 还有特定的死法
- How do we know that?!  - Because it's one by one and in a particular way,

67
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,163
你难道一点都没有注意到吗?
or have you not been paying attention?

68
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:27,155
那上面从来都没有提到过枪 对吗?
And nowhere on that does it say anything about a gun, does it,

69
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:29,143
你这个没有脑子的混蛋!
you idiotic, cretinous bastard?!

70
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,131
我和你一起去
I'll come with you.

71
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,169
不行!
No!

72
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:40,135
不行 我们... 要么一个人单独去 要么就大家一起去
No. We go... singularly, or in a group.

73
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:50,185
沃格雷夫法官 我听说你以前很喜欢判人绞刑
I hear you were one for the black square and the rope, Judge Wargrave.

74
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:55,155
有匹配的罪名的话 我确实很喜欢
When it was appropriate, yes.

75
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:59,167
这个胖子跟我说 你判死刑的罪犯行刑时 你都会去看
Tubs here tells me you used to watch all the hangings you'd ordered.

76
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,175
是真的吗?
Is that true?

77
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:04,095
真的 你别再这么叫我了
You really want to stop calling me that.

78
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,177
是真的吗 法官先生?
Is that true, Judge?

79
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:11,133
我有权因人们所犯的罪行而判他们死刑
I had the power to condemn men and women to death for their crimes.

80
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:15,385
权力越大 责任越大
With great power comes great responsibility.

81
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,171
我认为 如果在权力实行的时候 我却不在场的话
I believe that to look away as that power is exercised

82
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:23,217
就是不负责任和懦弱的表现
was both irresponsible and cowardly.

83
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:28,125
爱德华·塞顿受绞刑时 你在场吗?
Did you watch Edward Seton hang?

84
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:36,159
我还记得在报纸上看到过爱德华·塞顿的事
I remember Edward Seton, from the newspapers.

85
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,141
大家都说他是无辜的
Everyone said he was innocent.

86
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,159
他不是
He wasn't.

87
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,109
他留下了日记
He left diaries.

88
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,115
那上面记录了一个扭曲败坏的灵魂
They proved a warped and corrupted mind.

89
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:50,095
他认为他的受害者都是肮脏的
He believed his victims were full of filth

90
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:52,185
而他则是在清理这个世界的污浊
and that he was cleansing the world of their stain.

91
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:59,187
通过或正确或错误的线索嘲弄警察让他很开心
Taunting the police with... clues and misdirections excited him.

92
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,145
他就像虐待狂一样
As much as torture and sadism.

93
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:06,179
他有罪而你做出了正确的裁决
He was guilty and you passed the right verdict.

94
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:08,163
你为什么没有去观刑?
Why didn't you go and see him?

95
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,133
我去了
I did.

96
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,131
那一次场面很混乱
It was unsettling.

97
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,093
也与以往不同
Different.

98
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,137
他拒绝戴头罩
He refused the hood.

99
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,261
想让我看到他的脸
He wanted me to see his face.

100
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,135
可能是想证明我们之间有一些相似之处
Perhaps to impute there was some commonality between us,

101
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,159
也可能是... 想嘲讽我
perhaps to... laugh at me.

102
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:34,095
嘲讽你?
Laugh at you?

103
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:35,113
是的
Yes.

104
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,113
他想嘲讽正义
At justice.

105
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:41,145
因为这对他来说毫无意义
It meant nothing to him.

106
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:45,101
他不怕所谓的正义 也不怕我
He wasn't cowed by it, or by me.

107
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,149
我什么都不是
I was nothing.

108
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:52,161
很快就会被人们遗忘 成为历史的注脚
I would soon be forgotten, a footnote in history.

109
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:58,139
可是他却留下了恐怖和血腥
Whereas he, with his legacy of blood and horror,

110
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,113
并会被人永远记住
would be remembered for ever.

111
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:05,097
他还真的做到了
Well, it worked.

112
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,157
他至今仍然在我心头挥之不去
He haunts me still.

113
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,163
不过... 嘲笑与否
But... laughter or not,

114
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,189
正义总会到来
justice came, as it always does.

115
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:25,093
这个世界也不再被他的黑色恐怖所笼罩
And the world is free of his terrible darkness.

116
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,139
这样不行!
This is ridiculous!

117
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:44,135
我们不能就这么干坐着!
I mean, we can't just sit around doing nothing!

118
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,121
好啊 医生
Very well, Doctor.

119
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:50,157
我们说好要么单独 要么就一起行动
We said singly, or in a group.

120
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,179
我要去看会书了
I'm going to read.

121
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:58,585
阿姆斯特朗医生 我很抱歉 但是你这么激动真让我有点累了
I'm sorry, Dr Armstrong, but your agitation tires me greatly.

122
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:28,109
正义降临
Justice came.

123
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:32,111
杀手和沃格雷夫确实有着相似之处
The killer and Wargrave having common cause.

124
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:36,103
那就是造成他人死亡所带来的兴奋感
The same thrill... from handing out death.

125
00:08:36,105 --> 00:08:38,139
我说起法官先生的时候你还嘲笑我来着
You took the piss when I said the judge.

126
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,115
是啊 不过现在我改变了看法
Yes, well, now I think different.

127
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:44,185
他看过多少个人被处以绞刑? 这对一个人会产生什么样的影响?
How many men has he seen dangle? What does that do to someone?

128
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,151
他现在正独自一人
He's on his own.

129
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,177
可以谋划任何事情
Could be plotting anything.

130
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,169
停下吧 行吗?! 别再弄出这种声音了!
Stop it, will you?! Just stop it!

131
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:31,163
说的就像我们没有忍你很久了似的
As if we haven't had to put up with you.

132
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:34,127
气喘吁吁 还抽烟
Breathing and smoking.

133
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,173
坐立不安 来回踱步 
Scratching, fidgeting and pacing.

134
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,157
我要去休息了
I'm going to bed.

135
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:45,141
我自己去 或者谁来和我一起
Singly, or in a group.

136
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,141
你可以看着我上楼
You can watch me go up the stairs.

137
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,141
西里尔?!
Cyril?!

138
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:29,101
西里尔?!
Cyril?!

139
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,117
不!
No!

140
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,181
不!
No!

141
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,101
不要啊!
No!

142
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,167
维拉?
Vera?

143
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,105
嘿
Hey!

144
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:58,177
维拉?
Vera?

145
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:06,131
给 天啊 就是碳酸铵而已 是一种嗅盐
Here. For Christ's sake, it's sal volatile. Smelling salts.

146
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,159
慢慢呼吸 从鼻子吸进去 从嘴里吐出来
Breathe slowly. In through the nose, out through the mouth.

147
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:13,095
这就对了
There we are.

148
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:22,105
我以为屋子里还有别人
I thought there was somebody in the room with me.

149
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,175
给 喝口白兰地吧
Here, have some brandy.

150
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,123
不错嘛 维拉
Good for you, Vera.

151
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,111
怎么了 你觉得我对这酒做了手脚?
What, you think I've done something to it?

152
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:41,145
我去拿一瓶没开过封的好了
I'm going to go and fetch another bottle that hasn't been opened.

153
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:47,091
- 我想喝水  - 这白兰地没问题的
- I need some water.  - This brandy's all right.

154
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:48,155
我什么都没干
I haven't done anything to it.

155
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,143
受到惊吓之后喝点白兰地酒挺好的 所以我才拿了过来
Brandy's good for shock, that's why I got it.

156
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,117
他叫她维拉
He called her Vera.

157
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:56,135
隆巴德 这是第二次了
Lombard. That's the second time.

158
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,169
他们俩之间肯定发生了什么
There's something going on between them.

159
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:03,129
密封的 没人动过的
Sealed and untampered with.

160
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,145
那是干什么用的?
What's that for?

161
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:15,167
我也不知道 可能是挂吊灯的吧
I don't know. A chandelier, maybe.

162
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,103
就像楼下那个一样
Like downstairs.

163
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,111
卧室里面挂吊灯?
A chandelier in the bedroom?

164
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:21,091
毕竟这里住的都是奢侈的人 不是吗?
Well, it's posh people, innit?

165
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,107
他们在任何地方都可能挂吊灯
They put a chandelier anywhere.

166
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:26,103
他们要是真有钱就应该在猪圈里也挂上吊灯
Put a chandelier in a pigsty if the fancy took them.

167
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,167
我都有点喜欢你了 胖子
I'm becoming very fond of you, Tubs.

168
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:35,171
你这个自大的混蛋
You're an arrogant arsehole, you.

169
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:39,099
哦! 该死! 我很抱歉 克莱索恩小姐
Ooh! Bloody hell! Sorry, Miss Claythorne.

170
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,147
没事 你说得对 他就是个混蛋!
No, you're right. He's an arsehole!

171
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:45,165
法官先生呢?
Where's the judge?

172
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,117
天啊!
Jesus!

173
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,149
他被人开枪打死了
He's been shot in the head.

174
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:12,179
你要干什么?
Well, what are you doing?

175
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:15,155
要是我们想挪动他的话 就得把他的头包起来
Well, his head needs to be wrapped if we're going to move him.

176
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:17,119
他说得对
He's right.

177
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:20,111
我们可不想他的脑子溅的地板上到处都是
We don't want his brains spilling out all over the floor.

178
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:23,113
别用你的外套 阿姆斯特朗 我找点别的东西
Don't use your jacket, Armstrong. I'll find something else.

179
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:27,157
枪杀?
Shot?

180
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:30,157
- 你确定吗?  - 你自己看啊!
- Are you sure?  - Well, look at him!

181
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:34,157
我们到处搜查那把枪
We searched everywhere for that gun.

182
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:08,143
你曾经下楼去拿瓶子
You went back downstairs to get the bottle.

183
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:11,133
你也曾经下楼去拿了杯白兰地
You went downstairs, too, to get a glass of brandy.

184
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,151
还有你 你也有段时间不见人影
And you, you disappeared for a bit.

185
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:17,159
那是为了取我的包以便照顾... 维拉!
To fetch my bag so that I could attend to... Vera!

186
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:19,127
我们没听见枪声
We didn't hear the shot.

187
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,103
你可能开枪的时候拿垫子捂住了
You could have muffled it with a cushion.

188
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,183
我们只能相信你说的了
Well, we'll have to take your word for it.

189
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:26,099
我从没对人的脑袋开过枪 你更擅长这个
I've never shot a man in the head. That's more your field of expertise.

190
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:28,155
我怎么可能有足够时间下楼
How would I have had the time to go downstairs,

191
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,095
拿瓶白兰地
grab a bottle of brandy,

192
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,091
在没人听见的情况下 飞快的对着沃格雷夫开一枪
quickly put a slug in Wargrave, making sure that nobody heard him,

193
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:35,159
还要给他穿好衣服再上楼来?
dress him up and make it back upstairs again?

194
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,103
这儿的胖子离开的时间更长
Tubs here was away for longer.

195
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,095
我可没你跑得快
I'm not as quick on my feet as you.

196
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,131
"五个士兵小男孩 惹是生非打官司
"Five little soldier boys going in for law

197
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:44,143
官司缠身直到死 五个只剩四"
One got Chancery and then there were four."

198
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:47,107
一个接一个被杀
One by one

199
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:48,175
按照诗里的方式
and in a particular way.

200
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:50,123
我的枪去哪儿了?
And where's my gun?

201
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,145
- 别瞪着我!  - 也别瞪着我!
- Don't bloody look at me!  - Or me!

202
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:26,093
我受不了那风声了
I can't stand the sound of that wind.

203
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:29,177
我受不了了!
I can't stand it!

204
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:33,121
我可不打算坐着等死!
I'm not just going to sit here and wait to die!

205
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:47,169
打仗时 经常这么干!
In the war, do this all the time!

206
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,127
避免打瞌睡!
And stay awake!

207
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:56,119
到处是尸体!
Bodies, bodies, bodies, bodies!

208
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:59,163
到处是骨骸 鲜血 残肢!
Bones, blood, skulls!

209
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:02,127
像这样恣意狂欢!
Just this... this... this... this parade!

210
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:06,143
充斥死亡的无尽狂欢!
Endless parade of shattered... shattered meats!

211
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:11,099
站在那儿 拆胳膊卸腿
Just standing there, cutting off legs and arms

212
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:15,157
尸骸遍布 惨叫连连!
and... guts everywhere and bodies and screaming!

213
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,141
女士们 先生们 请肃静!
Ladies and gentlemen, silence, please!

214
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:32,159
你们被指控犯有以下罪名...
You are charged with the following indictments...

215
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:34,135
爱德华·乔治·阿姆斯特朗...
Edward George Armstrong...

216
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,155
是我!
That's me!

217
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:39,143
威廉·亨利·布洛尔
William Henry Blore.

218
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,179
还有我!
Yeah, that's me!

219
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,143
你谋杀了詹姆斯·斯蒂芬·兰道
That you did murder James Steven Landor.

220
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,179
维拉·伊丽莎白·克莱索恩...
Vera Elizabeth Claythorne...

221
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:50,155
那种气味! 还有噪音 各种噪音!
The smell! And the noise, the noise, the noise...!

222
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:05,131
狱中的罪犯们 你们是否认罪?
Prisoners at the bar, how do you plead?

223
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,129
有罪!
Guilty!

224
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:13,093
你们在笑什么?
What are you laughing at? 

225
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,139
布洛尔? 看看他们!
Blore? Watch them!

226
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,129
看看他们!
Watch them!

227
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,167
跟着我 维拉
You stick with me, Vera.

228
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,141
我们会挺过去的
We're going to get through this.

229
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:16,113
我可不打算被杀掉
I have no intention of getting killed.

230
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:23,125
其他人才会死 我们不会
Death... is for other people, not for us.

231
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:30,167
看到没? 看他们
You see? Look at them.

232
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,157
他们两个合谋 可能就是他们
Together. Perhaps it's them.

233
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,181
欧文夫妇
Mr and Mrs Owen.

234
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:41,107
是他们!
It's them!

235
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:42,175
是他们!
It's them!

236
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:44,133
是他们!
It's them!

237
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,189
好吧!
Fine!

238
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:54,091
我怎么带着这个傻帽子?!
Why am I wearing this fucking hat?!

239
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,129
我去睡了
I'm going to bed.

240
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:58,121
舞会结束了
This party's over.

241
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,139
看这里 帅哥 你被抓起来了
Now, look here, sunshine, you've been pinched.

242
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:19,171
我们都知道是为什么
And we know what for.

243
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:24,147
你躲在男厕所里鬼鬼祟祟
Lurking about in a gentleman's public convenience, in the bogs.

244
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:27,131
我是谁 又不是昨天才出生的?
What am I, born yesterday?

245
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,159
遇到我是你的运气
Now, you're lucky you got me.

246
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:32,157
亏得不是其他警察 他们可会下狠手
Not some other copper. He might've been a bit heavy-handed.

247
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:37,127
我说 看看你 你什么都不是!
I mean, look at you, there's nothing of you!

248
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:39,093
你软弱
You're soft.

249
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,165
像个桃子 或其他什么
Eh? Like a peach, or something.

250
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:46,137
一捏就碎
You'd be mush in a moment.

251
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,151
所以走吧
So go on.

252
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:52,133
走啊
On your way.

253
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:58,155
算是给你上了一课 行吗? 再小心些
Let this be a lesson to you, all right? Be more discreet.

254
00:22:58,157 --> 00:23:00,143
你可不想鼻子流血
You don't want to end up getting a bloody nose

255
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,091
或是看不见的内伤什么的
or doing a stretch inside

256
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:04,151
因为号子里可不是好玩的
because it's no fun for you lot in the nick.

257
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:06,109
走啊 快跑
Go on, scarper.

258
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,105
谢谢
Thank you.

259
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:18,169
我本可以放你走的 对吧?
That's what I should've done, innit?

260
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,097
我本可以放你走
That's what I should've done.

261
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,189
但是我不会
But I didn't.

262
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:25,187
混蛋!
Bastard!

263
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,143
隆巴德! 隆巴德快出来!
Lombard! Lombard!

264
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:32,111
隆巴德! 隆巴德快出来!
Lombard! Lombard!

265
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:41,091
怎么了?
What is it?

266
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,135
是他 是阿姆斯特朗!
It's him. It is Armstrong!

267
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:45,109
他从房子里出去了 我看见他了
He's left the house, I saw him.

268
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:50,115
锁上门 维拉 用椅子抵住
Lock your door, Vera, and put a chair against it.

269
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:29,105
你还好吗?
How are you?

270
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:32,115
汉密尔顿太太怎么样了?
How is Mrs Hamilton?

271
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:34,131
我要带她去伦敦
I'm taking her to London.

272
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,111
她不能待在这里
She can't stay here.

273
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:37,141
当然了
Of course.

274
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:43,175
她愿意补偿你三个月的工资
She, um... wants to give you three months' pay in lieu of notice

275
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:46,187
既然没有孩子可教了
because, obviously, you cannot be a governess

276
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:48,177
你也不用再当女家教了
when there is no child to govern.

277
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:55,093
如果汉密尔顿太太去伦敦 我可以照看房子
If Mrs Hamilton is in London, I can look after the house.

278
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:59,131
即使我不做女家教了 我也可以照看房子
Even if I'm not governess, I can still look after the house.

279
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,183
以朋友的身份
As a friend.

280
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,153
我打算把房子锁起来
I'm locking the house up.

281
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,101
我猜房子会被卖掉
I imagine it might be sold.

282
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:08,133
可现在是你的房子了
But it's yours now.

283
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:17,097
我还是另寻住处吧
I will have to find somewhere to stay.

284
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:19,181
找个舒服的旅馆住下
I'll find a nice hotel.

285
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:23,119
等你来的时候
For when you come down.

286
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:25,151
也许我可以找个小屋子
Perhaps I'll find us a little cottage.

287
00:26:25,153 --> 00:26:27,093
我得和奥利维亚待在一起
I have to be with Olivia.

288
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:30,121
她很不好
She's really rather unwell.

289
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:32,185
会有一场审讯
There will be an inquest.

290
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,099
他们打算快点办 所以会需要你
They want it to be quite soon, so you'll be needed.

291
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:39,185
没问题
Of course.

292
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:42,293
你会去吧?
And you'll come down for that?

293
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:46,141
我得走了
I have to go.

294
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:50,165
可怜的小西里尔
Poor little Cyril.

295
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:57,145
可怜的小西里尔
Poor little Cyril.

296
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:23,093
维拉? 是我们
Vera? It's us.

297
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,115
它就放在你床上
It was just on your bed.

298
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:04,171
它就放在我床上
It was just... on my bed.

299
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:07,119
我怎么知道昨晚你有没有把它放在那里?
Well, how do I know you didn't plant it in there last night?

300
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:09,183
如果菲利普在这之前就有枪 昨晚你们跟踪阿姆斯特朗的时候
If Philip had the gun before now, he would have taken it with you

301
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:11,171
他就该带上枪了 不是吗?
when you went after Armstrong, wouldn't he?

302
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,183
你可以偷偷溜出房间然后放在那里
You could have crept out of your room and planted it.

303
00:28:13,185 --> 00:28:15,159
反正那时又没人盯着你
There was no-one around here to hear you.

304
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,175
我把门锁上了 以免阿姆斯特朗回来
I had my door locked in case Armstrong came back.

305
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:21,143
阿姆斯特朗消失了 凭空消失了
Armstrong's disappeared. Thin air.

306
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:25,111
昨晚我们分头找他了 不是吗?
We split up when we went searching last night, didn't we?

307
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:27,151
- 是的 我们分头找了  - 你找到了吗?
- Yes, we did.  - Did you find him?

308
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:29,115
你把他推下悬崖了吗?
Did you chuck him off the cliff?

309
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:31,123
不是的 胖子 我没有找到他
No, Tubs, I didn't find him

310
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,093
- 然后把他推下悬崖 你呢?  - 没有!
- and chuck him off the cliff. Did you? - No!

311
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:36,155
没有
No.

312
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:38,109
鱼
Red herring.

313
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,151
你说什么?
What?

314
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:43,167
"四个士兵小男孩 结伙出海遭大难
"Four little soldier boys going out to sea

315
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:47,131
鱼吞一个血斑斑 四个只剩三"
A red herring swallowed one and then there were three."

316
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:49,107
鱼
Red herring.

317
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,143
阿姆斯特朗还活着
Armstrong's still alive.

318
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,133
为什么每次都是你猜出来的?
Why's it always you that works it out?

319
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:58,115
从最开始起就这样 对吧?
Has been from the off, innit?

320
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:00,135
就是你猜出来的
Working it out.

321
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,139
阿姆斯特朗也那样说过
Armstrong said that and all.

322
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:05,107
这是个漫长的夜晚
It's been a long night.

323
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:09,131
酒精和毒品让你脑子糊涂了 胖子
You're letting the booze and powder do the thinking for you, Tubs.

324
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,121
我说过别那么叫我
I've told you to stop calling me that!

325
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,183
你的名字叫威廉 是吧?
Your first name's William, isn't it?

326
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:18,187
应该叫你威尔 还是...?
Do you get Will, or...?

327
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:22,101
比尔 叫我比尔
Bill. I get Bill.

328
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,115
好吧 比尔
Well, Bill,

329
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,159
大声放音乐
whose idea was it to put music on,

330
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:31,105
再喝个酩酊大醉 这样我们就听不见任何东西 这是谁的主意?
to get drunk so we'd all pass out and not hear anything?

331
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:36,129
- 阿姆斯特朗  - 你最开始怀疑的是谁?
- Armstrong.  - And who did you first suspect?

332
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:40,173
从最开始起 你觉得谁最可疑?
Who did you get the scent on, right from the off?

333
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,161
阿姆斯特朗
Armstrong.

334
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:47,119
鱼
Red herring.

335
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:50,147
从最开始起 他就在挑拨我们
He's been playing us off each other from the start.

336
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,127
而他现在还活着
And he's still alive.

337
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:56,123
因为像这么大的小岛上 人不会凭空消失
Because people don't just vanish, not on an island this size.

338
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,181
他还活着
He's still alive.

339
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:04,165
我家有一片农田
I've got an allotment at home.

340
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,129
在埃德蒙顿
In Edmonton.

341
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,119
我很喜欢
I love it.

342
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:14,097
那是我的乐土
It's my little patch of paradise.

343
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:19,137
那是世上最美的地方 单只坐在那里 看着一切
That's the best thing in the world, just sitting there, watching it all.

344
00:30:21,093 --> 00:30:22,167
自在生长
Growing away.

345
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,159
嗯!
Hm!

346
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:29,101
从茶壶里倒杯茶 再来点面包和奶酪
Cup of tea from the flask and a bit of bread and a bit of cheese and...

347
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,157
还有刚刚从地里拔出来的萝卜
radish that you pulled from the ground a moment before.

348
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:37,149
又大又爽口的萝卜
Great, big, peppery radish.

349
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,129
很单纯
Simple things.

350
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:47,145
很幸福
Good things.

351
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:56,117
我后悔没把尤利克·诺尔曼·欧文的信直接扔进垃圾桶!
I wish I'd chucked that letter from Ulick Norman Owen in the bin!

352
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:00,143
可惜很对我口味
And it serves me right,

353
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:04,159
偷偷赚点外快
trying to earn... a bit of cash on the sly.

354
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:06,121
我们都喜欢如此
It serves us all right.

355
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,151
我们已经死了吗?
Are we dead already?

356
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:15,131
你说什么?
What?

357
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:19,173
也许我们已经死了 只是没有意识到而已
Perhaps we're dead already and we just don't realise it.

358
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:22,145
这就是地狱
And this is hell.

359
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:25,143
我们在地狱里
We're in hell.

360
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:28,141
我们为自己的罪行受到惩罚
And we're being punished for what we done.

361
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:32,177
因为我杀了他
Because I did kill him.

362
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,157
兰道
Landor.

363
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:41,109
我把他的脑浆都踩了出来
I stomped him till he was pulp.

364
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:45,159
踩得他妈都不认识他
His own mother couldn't see him.

365
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:47,141
道别都没能说一声
Couldn't say goodbye.

366
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,097
是我杀了他
I murdered him, all right.

367
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:58,093
他那么的无助 我没有停下
He was helpless and I didn't stop.

368
00:32:00,097 --> 00:32:01,297
他一定很害怕
He must've been so frightened.

369
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:05,183
他只不过是个... 小伙子
Just... just a young lad.

370
00:32:09,153 --> 00:32:12,171
我还有一地的番茄等着收割 谁来收割?
I've got a tomato crop that's got to be harvested. Who's going to do it?

371
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:15,159
我的田地会怎么样?
What's going to happen to my allotment?

372
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:18,119
嘿 嘿 得了 胖子
Hey. Hey, come on, Tubs.

373
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:19,153
咱们还没死呢
We're not done yet.

374
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:23,143
咱们三个对抗他一个 咱们能撑下去
It's us three against him. We can hold our own.

375
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:26,155
而且一定有人来救我们 一定... 会的
And someone has to come for us soon. They... they have to.

376
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:28,135
对 说得对
That's the spirit.

377
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:30,159
谁会来救我们呢?
Who's going to come for us?

378
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:34,141
那个该出现的纳拉科特从来没有出现过
That Narracott never turned up when he was supposed to.

379
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:37,135
估计他被买通了
Reckon he was paid off.

380
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,107
我们去生火
We light a fire.

381
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:41,179
在崖边生火 一定会有人看到的
On the cliff. Someone's bound to see it.

382
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:44,115
那就需要补给
OK. We're going to need supplies.

383
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:46,167
我不想再在这里过夜了 你们呢?
I don't want to spend another night in this house, do you?

384
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:49,105
估计我们被人监视了
I reckon we're being watched.

385
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:54,145
的确
We are.

386
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:22,181
- 走吧  - 好的
- Let's go.  - OK.

387
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,117
快点 胖子 我们走!
Come on, Tubs, let's go!

388
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,101
他在哪?!
Where is he?!

389
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,165
待在这别走
Stay here.

390
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:29,125
别跟着我!
Don't follow me!

391
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:21,167
三个士兵小男孩 动物园里遭祸殃
Three little soldier boys walking in the zoo

392
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:24,145
狗熊突然从天降 三个只剩两
A big bear hugged one and then there were two.

393
00:35:26,117 --> 00:35:27,141
可怜的胖子
Poor Tubs.

394
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:30,153
可怜的胖子
Poor Tubs.

395
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,125
涨潮了!
The tide's changing!

396
00:36:15,157 --> 00:36:17,093
菲利普?
Philip?

397
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,179
菲利普!
Philip!

398
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:21,141
下面有什么东西
There's something down there.

399
00:37:21,149 --> 00:37:23,105
阿姆斯特朗
Armstrong.

400
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:41,103
- 走吧!  -去哪?
- Come on!  - Where?

401
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,137
反正不是这儿
Not here.

402
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:45,103
我们得找个视角更好的地方
I need to find a better view.

403
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:48,139
不 不 不 我们... 我们不能把他留在这里
No, no, no. We... we can't leave him like this.

404
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,175
不可以这样 我们不能留下他
It's not right. We can't leave him!

405
00:37:50,177 --> 00:37:52,095
可以留下他
Yes, we can.

406
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:55,103
不 等船来了 菲利普 他们会看到他的
No, when the boat comes, Philip, they'll see him like this

407
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:57,175
我们还没有摆脱嫌疑 做... 该做的事
and we haven't done the decent, the... the right thing.

408
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:59,181
他们会怎么看我们?
How will it look for us?

409
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:02,113
拜托了!
Please!

410
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:04,177
拜托了!
Please!

411
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:35,163
是你!
It's you!

412
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:38,111
是你! 全是你干的 你干的!
It's you! It's all you, all of it!

413
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,183
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

414
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:41,151
你会杀了我的!
You're going to kill me!

415
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:46,151
不! 不 我不会杀你的 维拉
No! No, I'm not going to kill you, Vera.

416
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:49,163
- 但是岛上还有别人...  - 岛上没有别人了!
- But there's somebody else on this island...  - No, there's no-one else!

417
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:53,131
你不把枪给我 那个人会把我们俩都杀掉
There's somebody on this island and they're going to kill us both if you don't give me that gun.

418
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,143
没有别人了 你把他们都杀了!
There's no-one else, you've killed them all!

419
00:38:55,145 --> 00:38:57,139
听我说 我们被猎捕了!
Listen to me, we're being hunted!

420
00:38:57,141 --> 00:38:59,125
现在 我们都被猎捕了!
Right now, we're being hunted!

421
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:02,177
我需要那把枪!
I need the gun!

422
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:06,189
把枪给我
Give it to me.

423
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:11,181
维拉?
Vera?

424
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,133
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

425
00:39:22,189 --> 00:39:24,149
把枪给我 维拉
Give me the gun, Vera.

426
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:19,101
我答应他下课后可以玩棒球
I promised him a game of bat and ball after our lessons.

427
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:23,109
表现好的奖励
A reward for being so good.

428
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:27,135
他想游泳
He wanted to swim.

429
00:40:27,137 --> 00:40:29,117
他总是想游泳
He always wanted to swim.

430
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:31,157
但是我不同意
But I said no.

431
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:36,489
我去拿棒球棒和棒球的时候...
I went to get the bat and ball for our game...

432
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:39,157
他就跑了
and he was gone.

433
00:40:40,177 --> 00:40:42,147
我跑去追他
I ran after him.

434
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,137
用尽全力地跑
I ran as fast as I could.

435
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:48,127
要是我没有回头就好了
If only I hadn't turned away for a minute,

436
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,249
但是我去拿棒球 就那么短短的一分钟
but it was only a minute while I got the bat and ball.

437
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,093
要是...
If only...

438
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:10,165
谢谢你 谢谢你去救他
Thank you. Thank you for trying to save him.

439
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,185
天啊! 天啊!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

440
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:30,109
之前 我还不确定
You know, before, I wasn't sure.

441
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:35,091
但是现在我确定了
But I am sure now.

442
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,147
看着你 听着你的供词
Watching you, hearing you speak.

443
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:39,097
现在我确定了
Now I'm sure.

444
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:42,161
- 确定什么了?  - 你在说谎
- What are you sure of?  - That you're lying.

445
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:48,155
你连西里尔都... 追不上?
You couldn't catch up with... Cyril?

446
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:51,163
我看过你跑步 维拉
I've seen you run, Vera.

447
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,143
你很强壮 你跑得那么快 百米冲刺
You're fast. You're strong. You sprint.

448
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,163
只是回头走了几步路 你就追不上西里尔了?
You turn your back for a moment and you couldn't catch up with Cyril?

449
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:00,151
- 雨果 你不能这么想...  - 我知道你为什么要这么做
- Hugo, you can't think this...  - I know why you did it.

450
00:42:00,153 --> 00:42:03,171
但是你根本不知道我有多爱那个孩子
But what you don't understand is that I really loved that little boy.

451
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:06,157
我也爱他 我还爱你
So did I. And I love you.

452
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,187
我没法证明 我证明不了
I can't prove it. I can't prove a thing.

453
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:17,109
但是 维拉 假如我有证据... 我很想看着你上绞架
Oh, but, Vera, if I did have proof... I'd see you hang.

454
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,181
西里尔?
Cyril?

455
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:22,181
听着...
Now...

456
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:27,346
你有本事游到那块岩石吧?
you're strong enough to swim to that rock, aren't you?

457
00:43:28,153 --> 00:43:31,097
你足够强壮了 激动吗?
You're strong enough. Excited?

458
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:37,153
好了 准备好 去吧!
OK. On your marks, get set, go!

459
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:42,093
马上到了!
Nearly there!

460
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:48,177
坚持住!
Hold on!

461
00:44:52,113 --> 00:44:56,101
别害怕 我来救你了 我来救你了
Don't worry. I've got you. I've got you.

462
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:20,149
是雨果吗?
Hugo?

463
00:48:21,153 --> 00:48:23,101
是雨果吗?
Hugo?

464
00:48:40,149 --> 00:48:43,097
两个士兵小男孩 太阳底下长叹息...
Two little soldier boys sitting in the sun...

465
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:48,177
晒死烤死悲戚戚 两个只剩一
One got frizzled up and then there was one.

466
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:54,133
一个士兵小男孩 归去来兮只一人...
One little soldier boy left all alone...

467
00:48:56,113 --> 00:49:00,129
悬梁自尽了此生 一个也不剩
He went and hanged himself and then there were none.

468
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:06,135
你是不是很好奇脑浆是哪来的...?
You wondering about that...?

469
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:09,189
那是猪肝和腰子
Liver and kidneys.

470
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:13,179
医生说我死了 你们都相信了
You all believed the doctor when he said I was dead.

471
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:16,147
- 没人检查  - 让我下来!
- None of you checked.  - I need to get down!

472
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:19,137
阿姆斯特朗把事情简化了太多
Armstrong made it so much easier.

473
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,189
他很热衷于联盟
He was very keen to forge an alliance.

474
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:26,175
我不知道他以为会发生什么事
I don't know what he thought was going to happen

475
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:28,175
夜里他跑到外面来找我
when he ran out into the night to meet me.

476
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:30,161
大概以为我会救他
Perhaps that I was going to save him.

477
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:34,165
关于手术的事 我说谎了
I lied about the success of my surgery.

478
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:40,163
癌症肿瘤在扩散
The mass, the tumour is spreading.

479
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:44,183
除了等死 我无事可做
There's nothing to be done but await the inevitable.

480
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:47,149
而且病痛折磨着我
It's quite extraordinarily painful.

481
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:52,179
但是... 疼不了多久了
Well... not long now, though, hm?

482
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,143
你为什么这么做?
Why are you doing this?

483
00:49:54,145 --> 00:49:56,149
因为人人必得公正
Because justice comes to all.

484
00:49:58,157 --> 00:50:00,145
我和你们说过 你没听吗?
I told you that, were you not listening?

485
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,187
让我宣判爱德华·塞顿有罪的证据
The evidence that led me to convict Edward Seton

486
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:06,161
过于可怕 不宜公开
was considered too terrible to be made public.

487
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:11,093
犹如噩梦
It was the stuff of nightmares.

488
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,137
的确
Really.

489
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:17,101
而其他人被杀的时候...
And where others were revolted...

490
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,141
克莱索恩小姐 那让我着迷
Miss Claythorne, I was fascinated.

491
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:27,167
当塞顿直视我的双眼时
And when Seton looked into my eyes,

492
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:29,157
他可以看出我内心的兴奋
he could see that I was thrilled.

493
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,161
他知道我俩志趣相投
He knew that I was a kindred spirit.

494
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,161
而当他的脖子折断时...
And when his neck snapped...

495
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,187
我感到仿佛收到了一个礼物
I felt as if I'd been handed a gift.

496
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,119
不 不!
No. No!

497
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:46,179
你不是故意的
You don't mean any of this.

498
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:50,115
你是个好人 道德高尚
You are a good man. Moral.

499
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:52,131
道德高尚?
Moral?

500
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,111
也许确实高尚
Maybe there's something in that.

501
00:50:57,113 --> 00:51:00,093
塞顿和我有些不一样
There are differences between Seton and myself.

502
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,105
他的受害者都是无辜的
All his victims were innocent.

503
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,181
你们都是有罪的
You are all guilty.

504
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:10,143
想象一下
Now, imagine.

505
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:14,107
探长们走进来 看到一屋子被屠杀的尸体
The detectives arrive to find a house full of slaughter

506
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:17,173
U·N·欧文的杰作到处都是
and the handiwork of UN Owen everywhere.

507
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:23,171
但是U·N·欧文本人却不见踪迹
But UN Owen himself is nowhere to be seen.

508
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:26,095
但是杀掉清白无辜的法官的最后一枪
But who else could have fired the final shot

509
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:29,101
由谁来扣动扳机呢?
that ended the life of the unimpeachable judge?

510
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:34,133
十具尸体 不见杀手
Ten bodies and no murderer.

511
00:51:36,113 --> 00:51:38,103
此人如何消失无踪?
How could he have disappeared?

512
00:51:41,093 --> 00:51:43,157
真是高深莫测
It's so unfathomable.

513
00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:47,165
他们会调查个好几年
They'll be worrying about it for years.

514
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:51,171
不! 不 等等!
No! No, wait!

515
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:56,095
没有... 没有... 没有子弹了!
There's... there's no... there's no more bullets!

516
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:58,143
没人... 没人可以扣动扳机
There... there can be no final shot

517
00:51:58,145 --> 00:52:01,091
因为弹夹是空的
because the gun is empty.

518
00:52:01,093 --> 00:52:02,177
没有子弹剩下了
There are no more bullets.

519
00:52:04,097 --> 00:52:06,115
该死!
Damn!

520
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:08,131
全浪费了
That's all spoiled.

521
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,159
不 没有浪费
No, it's not spoiled.

522
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:12,143
对啊 周围都是尸体 就剩我一个人
Yes, it is. There are corpses everywhere and only me left.

523
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:15,091
不 不光有你 还有我!
No, not just you. There's me!

524
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:18,153
剩下了我们两个
The two of us, together.

525
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:21,183
我们可以... 可以说是菲利普干的
We'll... we'll say it was Philip.

526
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:23,155
他发疯了
That he was mad.

527
00:52:23,157 --> 00:52:26,135
我觉得他是我们当中最清醒的一个
Oh, he was quite the sanest of the lot, I thought.

528
00:52:26,137 --> 00:52:28,135
他发疯了
He was insane.

529
00:52:28,137 --> 00:52:31,181
他... 杀了我们所有人 我杀了他
He... he killed us all and I shot him.

530
00:52:33,113 --> 00:52:35,133
我杀了他以自卫
I shot him to defend us.

531
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:38,179
全是菲利普·隆巴德干的
It was all Philip Lombard.

532
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:42,131
他是你的情人
You took him as your lover.

533
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:44,131
是的
Yes.

534
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:47,139
- 你的脚上有他的血  - 自我防卫!
- Got his blood on your feet.  - Self-defence!

535
00:52:47,141 --> 00:52:49,109
我们就这么说
We'll say that.

536
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:53,165
我们就这么说 他们会相信我们的
We'll say that. They'll believe us.

537
00:52:54,165 --> 00:52:56,137
上次他们就相信了我
They believed me last time.

538
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:05,109
你真是个满嘴谎言的女人 克莱索恩小姐
What a beguiling woman you are, Miss Claythorne.

539
00:53:06,169 --> 00:53:08,093
维拉
Vera.

540
00:53:11,093 --> 00:53:13,117
其实我挺喜欢的
Quite my favourite, really.

541
00:53:14,185 --> 00:53:16,173
没有最后一颗子弹了 法官
There's no final bullet, Judge.

542
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:19,125
但是我可以让我们俩活下来
But I can save us both.

543
00:53:21,153 --> 00:53:24,189
我会保守秘密 让我们俩活下来
I'll keep your secret and I'll save us both.

544
00:53:26,157 --> 00:53:29,097
求你 放我下来!
Just let me down. Please!

545
00:53:46,129 --> 00:53:48,125
你忘记"杀死"我的那颗子弹了
You forgot the one that shot me.
