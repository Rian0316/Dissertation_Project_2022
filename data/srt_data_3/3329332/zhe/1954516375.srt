1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,499
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
KLAUS:
Previously on The Originals.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,002
如果我们不能联手合作
那还有什么意义？
HAYLEY: If we can't create some sort
of community, then what's the point?

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,607
不如杀掉彼此早点了事
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,471
大家寄望我来保护城里人类的安全
I'm invested in protecting
the people of this city,

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:12,838
要做到的话，我需要那把钥匙
and to do that, I need the key.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,345
- 我叫小约帮我偷来的
- 从我叔叔身上
-I had Josh lift it for me.
-Off my uncle.

7
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,745
我哥哥15年前教过我这个密码
My brother taught me this code
15 years ago.

8
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,885
- 你是克劳斯的父亲
- 我需要你
-You're Klaus' father?
-I need you.

9
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,851
- 我能做什么？
- 你能让我复活
-What can I do?
-You can bring me back to life.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,288
月光戒指保护狼人免受诅咒之苦
A moonlight ring to protect
werewolves from the curse.

11
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,825
- 你想要我怎么做？
- 我想知道它放在哪个石头里
What do I have to do?
I need to know what stone it housed.

12
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,486
一枚带有魔力的戒指
可以阻止这个诅咒的戒指
A ring of empowerment,
something to control this curse.

13
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,564
- 什么样的咒语能够…
- 我母亲的咒语可以
-What kind of spell--
-A spell of my mother's.

14
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,325
我只要求孩子安全
All I ask is that the child
is kept safe.

15
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:39,233
我们的女儿应该由父母共同养大
在自己的家成长
KLAUS: Our daughter should be raised
by her parents in our family home.

16
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,874
祖先们要我们杀了克劳斯的孩子
The ancestors want us
to kill Klaus' child.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,873
不管你和狼人在密谋着什么
Whatever it is
you got coming with the wolves,

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,478
你要知道，我会为了我的人奋战
just know that I'm gonna fight
for my guys,

19
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:50,047
我会为了我的城市奋战
我会一直奋战到最后一刻
I'm gonna fight for my city,
and I will fight until I am dead.

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,683
我想你也会这么做的
I would expect nothing less.

21
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,559
这一袋石头可让我们跑得够远了
Lot of driving for a bag of rocks.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,053
我们天亮前就能到法语区
We'll be in the Quarter by dawn.

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,663
你确定那个混合种会遵守他的诺言吗？
You sure the hybrid
will do his part?

24
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,094
海莉会确保他这么做的
Hayley will make sure of that.

25
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,895
是啊，我差点忘了
你未婚妻正将他掌控在股掌之间
Yeah. I forgot your fiancee
has got him around her finger.

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,095
知道吗，奥利，我一直待你如亲兄弟
You know, Ollie,
I love you like a brother

27
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,730
但如果你再这么对海莉
别怪我对你不客气
but if you don't lay off Hayley,
we're gonna have a problem.

28
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,467
注意点，罗密欧
Pay attention, Romeo.

29
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,716
好吧，别紧张
我们什么都没做
All right. Relax.
We ain't done anything.

30
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,425
晚安，警言
Evening, officers.

31
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,962
你们两个下车
Step out of the car, both of you.

32
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,724
有什么问题吗？
What's this about?

33
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,261
我想你们最好照他的话做
I think you should do
what the man says.

34
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,806
不然后果可能会很严重
Before things take a nasty turn.

35
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,383
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：纽奥良之战
(POLlCE RADlO CHATTER
CONTlNUES)

36
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,649
主演：约瑟夫摩根

37
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,387
我有说过你很棒吗？
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
Have I told you that you're awesome?

38
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:13,794
你太棒了，就跟阳光
日光戒指
Because you are,
along with the sun, daylight rings.

39
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,202
还有那个穿着背心慢跑的家伙一样棒
That guy jogging in the tank top.

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,101
小约，既然你已经得到戒指
我想你该离开了
-Josh.
-Hmm?
Now that you have a ring,
I think you need to leave town.

41
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,243
等等
主演：菲比托金
Whoa, wait.
Are we breaking up?

42
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,474
- 我们要分手吗？
- 我是认真的
I'm serious.

43
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,607
我知道，你向来都很严肃
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
Yeah, I know. Serious is kind of
your default setting,

44
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,084
所以你才需要我在你身边
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
which is why you need me around

45
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,086
逗你开心
to lighten you up.

46
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,654
所以，我是不会走的
主演：莉雅派普斯
Ergo, not leaving.

47
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,161
嘿，你还好吗？
-Hey. You okay?

48
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,493
只是些女巫的事情罢了
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
-Just witch stuff.

49
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,991
马赛尔昨天来找过我
Marcel came to me yesterday.

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,297
他想要我施一个隐身咒
He wanted a cloaking spell.

51
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,770
他准备对付克劳斯了，大行动
He's gonna make a move
against Klaus, a big move.

52
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,775
好吧，看来他忘了叫我，真过分
Wow. Okay.
Guess he forgot to call me. Rude.

53
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,845
那你帮他了吗？
Did you help him?

54
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,879
是的，因为我不希望他死
Yes, because I don't want him
to get killed

55
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,880
- 但如果克劳斯发现了…
- 听着
-but if Klaus finds out--
-Hey, look.

56
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,884
如果马赛尔已经有了计划
也许克劳斯会有所觉悟
If Marcel has got a plan,
maybe Klaus will buy a clue,

57
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,783
意识到他不是那么受人欢迎
realize he's a negative
on the popularity chart

58
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,015
然后去过吸血鬼的退休生活
and go into vampire retirement.

59
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,217
我听说棕榈泉是个好地方
I hear Palm Springs is nice.

60
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,323
克劳斯不是我们唯一要担心的
Klaus isn't the only thing
we need to be afraid of.

61
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,693
听着，如果战争来临
Look. If there's a war coming,

62
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,199
答应我你会尽快离开，绝不牵涉其中
promise me you'll go
before you get caught up in it.

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,801
你母亲的咒语十分优雅，却也非常复杂
Your mother's spell
is as complicated as it is elegant.

64
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,502
显然她是个极有天赋的女巫
She was clearly a very gifted witch.

65
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,281
是不是这一段？
-ls this the bit here?

66
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,681
我说过了，这很复杂
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
-Hey, like I said, it's complicated.

67
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,821
她将保护魔法绑定在黑色蓝晶石上
制片：兰斯安德森
She bound protection magic
to black kyanite stones.

68
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,116
拥有石头的狼人
可以不用在月圆时变身
A werewolf with the stones is free
from turning on a full moon.

69
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,759
它还有什么好处吗？
And what of the improvements?

70
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,124
这个咒语能增强速度、力量和敏捷度
This spell will enhance speed,
strength and agility.

71
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,288
这里面应该会提到尖牙
There should be something in there
about fangs.

72
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,196
她当时就是用这个
将我们变成吸血鬼的
It's what my mother used on us
when she turned us into vampires.

73
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,269
不只是尖牙
Not just fangs.

74
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,099
你说过你想保留毒液
You said you want venom

75
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,104
让狼人的咬伤仍然对吸血鬼致命
制片：邦妮怀斯
so the bite is still lethal
to vampires.

76
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,678
就是这里
这会是个好礼物的
Here.
Should make a nice gift.

77
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,544
- 我想海莉一定会十分惊喜
- 不只是给海莉的
-I'm sure Hayley will be thrilled.
-Oh, not just Hayley.

78
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,709
你要帮我做更多
You'll be making
quite a few of these.

79
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,344
不如就一百个吧
Let's call it an even hundred.

80
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,388
这不是我和以利亚的约定
That's not the deal
I made with Elijah.

81
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,084
你现在要打交道的人是我
Well, you're dealing with me now.

82
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:27,427
而我会给你更多的报酬
And I am offering considerably more.

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,366
你以为我们上了床
我就要对你言听计从吗？
You think because I sleep with you,
I'm suddenly at your beck and call.

84
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,300
正因为我们上了床，亲爱的
Because you sleep with me, love,

85
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,067
我才会保护你不受别人的伤害
编剧：查理察尔邦尼，麦克纳度奇
I will protect you from those
who might do you harm,

86
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,641
包括我哥哥
including my brother.

87
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,473
而且，因为我需要你
导演：杰弗利亨特
Because I need you, however,

88
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,614
所以除了我的保护之外
我会给你一样
I'm prepared to offer
something more valuable

89
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,910
更有价值的东西
than my protection.

90
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,609
那是什么？
Which is what?

91
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:52,622
我母亲的魔法书
这些咒语的出处
My mother's grimoire,
from which I took these spells.

92
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,852
要知道，以利亚只许你窥探其中一二
You see, Elijah is offering you
a mere peek at its pages,

93
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,931
但我会将它完整地双手奉上
but I will grant it to you as a gift

94
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,034
如果你宣誓效忠于我
if you pledge your loyalty to me,

95
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,670
从这些戒指的制造方法开始
beginning with the creation
of those rings.

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,740
这就是你一直以来的计划
This has been your plan all along.

97
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,174
你想建立一支狼人军队
而你在利用我来达成这个目的
You want to build a werewolf army
and you're using me to do it.

98
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:19,251
亲爱的，我不是你的敌人
那些狼人也不是
Sweetheart, I'm not the enemy.
Nor are the wolves.

99
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,582
你那残酷的族人希望你牺牲自己
Your abusive coven expects you
to sacrifice yourself

100
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,848
来复活最后一名收获祭女孩
for the last of the harvest girls.

101
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,818
如果你帮我这个忙
Do this one favor for me

102
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:35,798
你就再也不用惧怕任何人了
and you need never fear
anyone ever again.

103
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,976
各位，你们该离开了
MAN:
Folks, you need to leave now.

104
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,381
嘿
你这是在干什么？
Hey. Hey, what are you--

105
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,390
我已经试着友善了
I tried to be nice about this.

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,585
你以为你是谁？
Who the hell do you think you are?

107
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,526
我是这家秋基汤店的新老板
I am the new owner
of this gumbo shack.

108
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,464
这是刚刚才达成的交易
但我可以告诉你，售价很便宜
Ink is not dry on the contract yet,
but I can tell you, I got it cheap.

109
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:10,897
自从苏菲德弗罗死后
Business is not what is used to be

110
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,664
这里的生意就一落千丈
since Sophie Deveraux
kicked the bucket.

111
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,208
听着，我不想惹麻烦
Look.
I don't want any trouble.

112
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,439
我不在乎你想要什么
我们来聊聊我想要什么
I don't really care what you want.
Let's talk about what I want.

113
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,912
是的，我叔叔的钥匙
-Right. My uncle's key.
-Hmm.

114
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,573
你说你要用它来
You said you were gonna use it

115
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,050
保护这个城市的无辜人们
to protect the innocents
of the city.

116
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,382
但以你的职业来说，这还真讽刺啊
Seems pretty ironic,
given your line of work.

117
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,382
我是个奉公守法的商人
I'm a legitimate businesswoman

118
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,459
从来没有犯过罪
who's never been convicted
of a crime

119
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,394
同时，身为人类决策群的领袖
and, as leader of the human faction,

120
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,001
钥匙应该是我的
that key is mine.

121
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,962
我给了你时间哀悼
现在时间到了
I gave you time to mourn.
Now time is up.

122
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,337
知道了
Message received.

123
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,071
那就来找找我没有的那把钥匙吧
Let me just go find that key
I don't have.

124
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,078
我的家族在纽奥良生活很久了，卡蜜
My family has been in New Orleans
for a long time, Cami,

125
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,913
比你的家族还久
even longer than yours.

126
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:06,019
而我们都知道没有朋友
And we've learned
it's a very hard city to get by in

127
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,057
在这个城市很难生存
if you don't have any friends.

128
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,124
我很愿意成为你的朋友
I'd like to be your friend.

129
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,597
所以我给你的期限是明天
So I'm gonna give you
until tomorrow,

130
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,465
在那之后，我就不会这么客气了
and after that,
I won't be so friendly.

131
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,380
放过他
Leave him alone.

132
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,047
我们可以放过他
只要你告诉我们克劳斯的计划
We'll leave your boy alone when
you tell us what Klaus is up to.

133
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,887
我怎么会知道他的计划？
How the hell should I know
what he is up to?

134
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,427
因为我知道你们有碰过面
See, I know you've been meeting him.

135
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,862
你袋子里的那些石头是黑蓝晶石
The stones in your duffel bag,
it's black kyanite.

136
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,262
很稀有
It's pretty rare.

137
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,903
我也了解不少巫术的事
I also know enough about witchcraft

138
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,539
能够分辨哪些是施咒材料
to recognize the ingredients
of a spell.

139
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,707
你要让我再问一遍吗？
So, you'll make me ask again?

140
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,174
好吧
Okay.

141
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,555
你想知道有两个狼人
作为人质的问题所在吗？
You wanna know the problem
with having two werewolf hostages?

142
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,621
那就是你只需要一个
You really only need one.

143
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,821
你们这些新月小子
你们自以为很厉害
You Crescent boys,
you think you're a bunch of badasses

144
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,090
但在1925年
but back in '25,

145
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,927
我消灭了整个葛雷拉家族
I wiped out a whole bloodline
of Guerrera werewolves.

146
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,864
他们可比你们厉害多了
They were a lot tougher than you.

147
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,963
等一下
Wait!

148
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,542
你放了他
You let him go,

149
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,310
我就告诉你石头的事
还有克劳斯
I will tell you about the stones,
about Klaus...

150
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,686
任何事情
whatever.

151
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,619
好吧，好吧
就这么说定了
All right. All right.
A deal is a deal,

152
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,557
但因为这个家伙
在八小时后就要变成狼了
but since Nirvana here is gonna turn
into a wolf in about eight hours,

153
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,130
小迪，把他扔在河口
D, drop his ass off way out
in the bayou.

154
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,631
那我能不能杀了这个蠢货？
Will I at least get to kill this fool?

155
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,861
不，我有个更好的主意
No. I got a better idea.

156
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,406
喂，老哥，什么事？
Yes, brother?
What is it?

157
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,676
看来我们的狼人迷路了，弟弟
It appears our wolves
have gone astray, brother.

158
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,480
- 他们几个小时前就该回来了
- 我们需要找到他们
-They should've been back hours ago.
-We need to find them.

159
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,747
这可能有点困难
Well, that might be a bit tricky.

160
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,448
因为我们在一条偏僻的乡村小路上
You see, we've located their car
on a backroad

161
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,717
发现了他们的车
in the middle of nowhere.

162
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,827
我怀疑他们被人劫持了
I suspect they've been shanghaied.

163
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,156
而你觉得这种讯息不需要告诉我们吗？
And you didn't feel the need
to share this information?

164
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,697
我本打算等我找到了解决方法后
It was my intention to present you
with the problem

165
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,994
才把问题告诉你
only after I'd found
an appropriate solution.

166
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,933
- 那就给我们个惊喜吧
- 说话这时我就要成功了
-Well, do enlighten us.
-I'm closing in on it as we speak.

167
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,938
唯一有胆子抓走我狼人盟友的人
The only person
who would be bold enough

168
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:39,202
正是最输不起的人
to snatch my wolf allies
is the one who has the most to lose.

169
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,279
- 马赛尔
- 他会杀了他们的
-Marcel.
-No. He'll kill them.

170
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:46,214
洁妮薇向我证实了
马赛尔被施了个隐身咒
Genevieve assures me that Marcel
has procured a cloaking spell.

171
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,047
唯一会帮助马赛尔的女巫就是黛维娜
The only witch who will aid Marcel
is Davina.

172
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,452
我只需要再收集一点筹码
I just need to get
one last bit of leverage

173
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,456
然后就去拜访她
before I pay her a visit.

174
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,398
筹码来了
And there it is.

175
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,265
你好，约书亚
Hello, Joshua.

176
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,803
黛维娜
Davina.

177
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,391
小约？
Josh?

178
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,000
- 对不起
- 发生什么事了？
-I'm sorry.
-What happened?

179
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,068
约书亚被狼人咬了
KLAUS: Joshua went
and got himself a werewolf bite.

180
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,331
正确地说是混合种咬的
但都一样会要他的命
Well, a hybrid bite, technically
but it will kill him just the same.

181
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,101
- 你为什么要这么做？
- 这都怪你
-Why are you doing this?
-I blame you.

182
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,235
尽管我主动向你表示善意
你还是选择站在马赛尔那边
After my overtures of friendship,
you once again sided with Marcel,

183
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,349
让我不得不对你在乎的人
做一些残忍的事
forcing me to do horrible things
to someone you care about.

184
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,513
我也没那么残忍，黛维娜
我可以治好他
I'm not without mercy, Davina.
I can cure him,

185
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,991
但你必须合作
告诉我马赛尔在哪里
but you have to cooperate
and tell me where to find Marcel.

186
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,290
为什么？好让你也杀了他吗？
Why? So you can kill him too?

187
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,593
马赛尔选择了他的立场
Marcel chose his path.

188
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,169
但让小约为此受罪似乎不太公平
Seems unfair that Josh
should have to suffer for it.

189
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,572
- 黛维娜，拜托…
- 他在码头的一个仓库里
-Davina. Please.
-He's at a warehouse at the docks.

190
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,508
提艾里的住所
Thierry's place.

191
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:27,016
瞧，这也不是太难，对吧？
You see?
That wasn't so hard, now was it?

192
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,244
那小约怎么办？
What about Josh?

193
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,290
他还能再活一天
Well, he'll live another 24 hours
or so.

194
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,791
我可能还会需要你
约书亚就是最好的筹码
I may need you, and Joshua serves
as wonderful leverage.

195
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,761
下次我再提问的时候
回答得快点
The next time I ask a question,
answer quicker.

196
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,766
谢谢你抽出时间
CAMlLLE: Thank you for your time.
I didn't realize

197
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,635
直到看到我叔叔的遗嘱
我才知道他还有这么个地方
my uncle even had this place
until a read about it in his will.

198
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,970
我的家族守着这个房子几十年了
This building has been in my family
for decades.

199
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,511
在卡崔娜飓风后
你叔叔帮助我们筹款修缮了它
Your uncle helped us raise the funds
to restore it after Katrina.

200
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,946
我注意到他把这个房间留出来了
I figured he'd kept this room
for extra space.

201
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,881
总之，我什么也没问
Anyway, I didn't ask any questions.

202
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:08,319
你知道，基神父，他是一个好人
You know, Father K,
he was as good as they come.

203
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,428
节哀顺变
Sorry for your loss.

204
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,470
可以让我自己进去吗？
Um.
Do you mind if I go in alone?

205
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,595
（梧桐街456号310室）

206
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,749
宝藏原来在这啊
Here's to buried treasure.

207
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,198
你好啊
Hello.

208
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,952
（给卡蜜）

209
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,451
以利亚那边该有消息了
Elijah should've called by now.

210
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,118
担心也没有用
Worrying isn't going to help.

211
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,662
你应该坐下来，保持冷静
You should sit down,
try to keep calm.

212
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,598
你现在是什么了？
巫师外加禅宗人生导师吗？
What are you now,
magician-slash-Zen life coach?

213
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,565
虽然与我当护士时相比
The treatment of pregnant women

214
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,605
孕妇的治疗方法有了巨大的进步
has advanced remarkably
since I was a nurse,

215
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,677
但我也知道高血压
对你和你的孩子不好
but even I know high blood pressure
is bad for you and your baby.

216
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:44,509
尤其是你马上就要足月了
especially now
that you're so close to term.

217
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,551
我讨厌这样
我感觉自己很没用
I hate this.
I feel completely useless.

218
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,384
你还不明白吗？
你才是这一切的意义所在
Don't you get it?
You're the point of all this.

219
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,085
克劳斯和以利亚四处奔波
Klaus and Elijah
running all over town,

220
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,231
都是为了你啊
我都有点嫉妒了
it's all for you.
I'm a bit envious.

221
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,389
很好，我真幸运
Great. Lucky me.

222
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,730
- 有什么我能给你的吗？
- 月光戒指怎么样？
-ls there anything I can get you?
-How about a moonlight ring?

223
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,601
到月圆之夜
The spell can't be performed

224
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,174
才能施咒
until the full moon
reaches its apex.

225
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:16,076
当然，我需要那些石头
它们很快就会送到这里了
And, of course, I need the stones,
which will be here soon enough.

226
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,939
有点信心吧
Have a little faith.

227
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,584
得表扬马赛尔
Accolades to Marcel.

228
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,890
他对你的鼻梁可是费了一番工夫
He did quite a dance
across the bridge of your nose.

229
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,560
他现在在哪？
Where is he now?

230
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,629
哪儿都找不到
Nowhere to be found.

231
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,504
不过他倒是留给我们一个
不错的饯别礼
Although he did leave us
a delightful parting gift.

232
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,376
- 石头呢？
- 不知道
-What about the stones?
-I don't know.

233
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,642
- 放开我，我会帮你们找的
- 乖乖坐着
-Untie me. I'll help you find them.
-Sit still.

234
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,286
只要安全了就会放了你
You'll be freed
as soon as it's safe.

235
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,486
我们应该把重点放在石头上
Our focus should be the stones.

236
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,924
考虑到杰克森也想得到海莉的爱
Considering Jackson is competition
for Hayley's affection,

237
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,324
我想你会同意的
I think you'd agree.

238
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,589
别理我弟弟
Disregard my brother.

239
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:07,891
过了一千年
Over the course
of the last millennium,

240
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,035
他的才智已有所减弱
his capacity for tact
has somewhat diminished.

241
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,499
这很典型，不是吗？
Oh, that's typical, isn't it?

242
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,936
马赛尔将一间屋子塞满炸药
而我却是没脑子的那个
Marcel fills a room with dynamite
and yet I'm the tactless one.

243
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,077
我认出这些炸药就是攻击河口的那种
I recognize these explosives
from the attack on the bayou.

244
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,734
你能再提醒我一下
Could you remind me again

245
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,710
你为什么觉得马赛尔是无辜的吗？
why you believed
that Marcel was innocent?

246
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,941
提醒我在挖出他的内脏之前问问他
Remind me to ask him
before I pull out his innards.

247
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,955
好吧，在这片区域活动要非常小心
Okay. Exercise extreme caution
in this general area.

248
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,115
有点乱
-(CELL PHONE RlNGS)
-Bit of a mess.

249
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,522
（海莉来电）

250
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,091
真是好时机
Impeccable timing.

251
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,290
- 怎么了？
- 杰克森没事
-What's going on?
-Jackson is fine.

252
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,868
他现在有点抽不开身
晚点回给你好吗？
He's a little tied up right now.
Could we call you back?

253
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,669
- 不太妙啊
- 你是想害死我们吗？
-Oh, that doesn't bode well.
-Are you trying to kill us?

254
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,780
以利亚，告诉我怎么了？
Elijah, tell me what's going on now.

255
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,643
这是为了提艾里
"This is for Thierry."

256
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,022
- 我可以
- 谢天谢地你还活着
-JACK: Oh, I got it.
-Thank God you're alive.

257
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,370
我也很好，多谢关心
I'm fine too.
Thanks for asking.

258
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,408
石头怎么样了？
What about the stones?

259
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,411
我猜是散落在密西西比河的河底了
Scattered across the bed
of the Mississippi, I imagine.

260
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,843
马赛尔不傻
Marcel is no fool.

261
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,381
他知道一支变强大的狼人军队
He knows an empowered
werewolf army

262
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,815
就意味着纽奥良吸血鬼的末日
would mean the end of vampires
in New Orleans.

263
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,388
爆炸就是他表示要阻止这事的方式
The explosion is his way of saying
he means to prevent that,

264
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,717
对他有利
for all the good it'll do him.

265
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,587
对他真是太有利了，不是吗？
Well, it did him pretty damn well,
didn't it?

266
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,194
这是我的错，我会想办法弥补
This is my fault.
I will find a way to fix it.

267
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,729
不，杰克，你受伤了
而且没人责怪你
No, Jack. You're hurt,
and no one is blaming you.

268
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,060
我就责怪你
I'm blaming you.

269
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,203
那些石头难以取代
Those stones
will be hard to replace.

270
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,936
幸运的是，我总是有备用计划
Fortunately, I always have
a backup plan.

271
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,011
你不是指她吧，她可是大坏蛋
You can't seriously mean her.
She's a gangster.

272
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,306
我见识过她
I see her more as a means

273
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,881
在很短时间里取得稀有物品
to procuring rare items
at short notice.

274
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,876
欢迎，科雷亚女士
我看到你带了人来
Greetings, Ms. Correa.
I see you've brought company.

275
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,454
这些是我的兄弟
These are my brothers.

276
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,091
我总是会带着他们做愉快的生意
I always include them
in delicate business matters.

277
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,219
各位，这就是米卡森先生
Fellas, meet Mr. Mikaelson.

278
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,957
叫我克劳斯就行
我朋友们都这么叫我
Please, call me Klaus.
All my friends do.

279
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,691
我不知道我们算不算是朋友
I don't know if I'd call us friends.

280
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,031
但如果你和马赛尔打算拚个你死我活
But if you and Marcel are planning
on having a little throw down,

281
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,900
我希望我的家人
I'd prefer my family

282
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,906
能够和必胜者站在同一边
to be on the same side
as the inevitable victor.

283
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,737
你带来了我要的东西
Then you have what I asked for.

284
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,075
这么短时间建立一支军队来不及
但这也是开端了
Not enough for an army at
such short notice, but it's a start.

285
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,776
奇怪，我并不知道她很了解我们的计划
Strange, I wasn't aware
that she was familiar with our plan.

286
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,888
和我谈生意的条件就是我要知悉全局
FRANCESCA: My price
for doing business is full disclosure.

287
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,421
你弟弟连守要求了
Your brother complied.

288
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,560
人类决策群想从这事里得到什么好处？
And what does the human faction
expect to benefit from all this?

289
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,561
我只想重申对统治阶层的忠诚
I only wanna solidify our allegiance
to the ruling class.

290
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,096
有利生意
It's good for business.

291
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,429
要是大家都像你这么通情达理就好了
If only everyone shared
your capacity for reason.

292
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,002
可惜他们没有
Sadly, they don't.

293
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,639
马赛尔现在复仇心极重
Marcel is being
especially vindictive.

294
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,435
我担心他会因为我和你见面
I'm worried he might
come after me or my family

295
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,770
而对付我或是我的家人
just for meeting with you.

296
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,473
如果我们能联合起来才对我们最有利
It might be in our best interests
if we combine our efforts.

297
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,809
那就这样吧
So be it.

298
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,544
越多人保护宅邸越好
The more bodies we have
to defend the compound, the better.

299
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,618
我们开始吧
Let's get started, shall we?

300
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,186
- 好了
- 谢谢
-There.
-Thank you.

301
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,264
别谢我，是以利亚救了你
Don't thank me. It was Elijah
who vamped your ass to safety.

302
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,924
是啊
他似乎真的很在乎你
Yeah. Well, he really seems
to care about you.

303
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,866
这很复杂
It's complicated.

304
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,063
我想这是本年度最佳保守陈述
I think that's the
understatement of the year.

305
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,772
我该走了
在月亮升起前
Look. I gotta go,
get back to the bayou

306
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,378
回到河口
before the moon rises, so....

307
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,449
杰克森，这会是最后一次
Jackson, this will be the last time.

308
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,517
今晚过后，你就再也不用变身了
After tonight,
you'll never have to turn again.

309
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,090
没有痛苦，不用躲在河口，我保证
No more pain, no more hiding
in the bayou, I promise.

310
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,591
你知道，克劳斯并不是真心要这么做
You know, Klaus isn't doing this
out of the kindness of his heart.

311
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,896
他是为了你，海莉
He's doing it for you, Hayley.

312
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,057
是你改变了我们的一切
You're the one who's gonna change
everything for us.

313
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,904
看来我又欠你一次了
Seems I owe you yet again.

314
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,481
我明白他冒着生命危险救他的朋友
I understand he risked his life
to save his friend.

315
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,918
- 他是个好人
- 是的
-He's a good man.
-Yes, he is.

316
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,352
以利亚，我有事要告诉你
Elijah, there is something
that I need to tell you.

317
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,599
我的家人想让我…
My family wanted me....

318
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,069
我和杰克森有婚约在先
I was supposed to be
betrothed to Jackson.

319
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,002
我本来想早点告诉你
我只是不知道该如何开口
I wanted to tell you sooner.
I just didn't know how.

320
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,440
这是个荒唐的习俗
It's this insane custom--

321
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,410
不，你不需要解释什么
No.
You don't need to explain anything.

322
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,277
我明白需要为家人做出牺牲
I understand the need
to make sacrifices for one's family.

323
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,353
别这样，以利亚
Oh, come on, Elijah.

324
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,456
在你无尽的生命里
你就不能有一次不这么高尚吗？
For once in your immortal life,
can you just not be so noble?

325
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,922
那你希望我怎么做？
What would you have me do?

326
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,924
我只是告诉你因为一些
I just told you that I'm betrothed

327
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,461
我不认识的人订下的规矩
according to some
backwater arrangement

328
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,996
我有了婚约
by people that I never knew.

329
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,028
告诉我你觉得这样的订婚很愚蠢
Tell me that you think
betrothals are stupid.

330
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,603
告诉我我有选择
Tell me that I have a choice.

331
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,517
你永远都有选择
You will always have a choice.

332
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,492
我相信你已经准备好了
I trust you are ready.

333
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,257
最后一样材料是很私人的
The last ingredient is personal.

334
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,957
这个咒语的目的是控制变身
As this spell is designed
to control transformation,

335
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,501
我需要不在月圆时变身的狼人的血
I need the blood of a werewolf
who doesn't turn on a full moon.

336
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,630
我的第一人选是海莉，因为她怀孕了
My first thought was Hayley
because of the pregnancy--

337
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,331
不可能
Out of the question.

338
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,773
我宁愿我未出生孩子的母亲
I'd just as soon limit
the mother of my unborn child

339
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,434
不要受到你巫术的副作用影响
to the side effects
of your witchery.

340
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,881
我是半狼人，我控制住了我的狼形
I am half wolf.
I control my form.

341
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,282
用我的血
Use my blood.

342
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,258
如果你未能完成你的交易
If you fail to uphold
your end of the deal,

343
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:17,767
那你的后果将会不堪设想
the consequences for you
will be apocalyptic.

344
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,864
你说了最浪漫的事
You say the most romantic things.

345
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,491
感谢你们都来了，已经有一段时间了
I appreciate you all coming.
It's been a while.

346
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,186
到目前为止，你们听说了现在的情况
By now,
you've heard what's going on.

347
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,391
克劳斯找到了让狼人
对我们随时有威胁的办法
Klaus found a way to make
werewolves lethal to us 24/7.

348
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,934
码头的爆炸是我
The fireworks at the docks,
that was me

349
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,469
试图破坏他的计划
trying to spoil his plan.

350
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,237
但他的计划还是继续实行了
He's moving forward anyway.

351
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,904
他有巫女，有咒语
He's got as witch, he's got a spell,

352
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,978
如果他成功了
and if he pulls this off,

353
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,639
一夜之间
我们就会从猎人变成猎物
in one night,
we go from hunter to prey.

354
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,212
我知道你们有人在想
Now I know
what some of you all are thinking.

355
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,549
我们以前反抗过克劳斯，但失败了
We stood against Klaus before,
and we failed.

356
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,527
那是我的问题，我失败了
Uh-uh. That's on me. I failed.

357
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:20,358
我放弃了攻击
因为我以为那是救大家的唯一办法
I called off the attack because l
thought it the only way to save lives.

358
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,056
但毫无疑问
But make no mistake.

359
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,668
如果我们现在不反抗他
If we don't stand against him now,

360
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,236
我们的生命一样不值钱
our lives aren't worth a damn
anyway!

361
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,169
智者说
Wise man said,

362
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,607
“知己知彼
if you know yourself
and know your enemy,

363
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,839
百战不殆
then you don't need to fear
the outcome of battle.

364
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,212
我了解我自己，了解我的朋友
I know myself.
I know my friends.

365
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,750
也了解我的敌人
And I know my enemy.

366
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,912
我知道他的优势，知道他的得意
I know his strengths,
I know his pride.

367
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,924
我对他房子的每一个角落都了如指掌
And I know his house,
every nook and cranny.

368
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,959
我们今晚就去
We're gonna go there tonight,

369
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,064
同时从各个角度下手，要快狠准
hard and fast,
all at once, from every angle.

370
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,665
杀了他们的女巫
We kill their witch,

371
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,234
毁了她的魔法书，然后离开
destroy her spell book,
and get the hell out.

372
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,038
至于克劳斯，他会来追杀我
And as for Klaus,
he'll be coming for me.

373
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,576
那正是我想要的
我会引开他
And that's exactly what I want.
I'll lead him away.

374
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,113
你们其他人要通过以利亚
I just need the rest of you
to get past Elijah

375
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,945
做该做的事情
and do what needs to be done.

376
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,246
这就是计划
So that's the plan.

377
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:20,289
我现在就要知道，谁支持我？
I need to know right now!
Who's with me?

378
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,449
我的人说马赛尔要行动了
还带着他的朋友
My people say Marcel is on the move
and he's bringing friends.

379
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,620
把海莉带到安全的地方
Get Hayley to safety.

380
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,689
- 跟我走
- 不
-Come with me.
-No.

381
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,827
得有人看着她
Someone needs to watch her.

382
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,153
你应该帮克劳斯
You should help Klaus.

383
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,428
我的兄弟们和他们的随从
对付不了吸血鬼军队
My brothers and their security
won't be much against a vampires.

384
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,834
我留下来陪海莉
I'll stay with Hayley.

385
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,637
去吧，以利亚
Go, Elijah.

386
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,673
不要退缩
And don't hold back.

387
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,965
我以为这群人会学到教训
I thought this lot
would've learned their lesson.

388
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,873
他们没那么聪明
Well, they're not exactly renowned
for their genius.

389
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,879
那么这个杂耍团的领导者是谁？
So where's the ringleader
of this circus?

390
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:55,050
太害怕而不敢露面吗？
Too afraid to show his face?

391
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,211
我在这里
I'm here.

392
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,380
给你们最后一次机会
And I'm gonna offer you
one last chance.

393
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,891
收拾好东西
滚出我的城市
To pack your stuff
and get the hell out of my town.

394
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,964
你又一次让你的人匆匆送死了
You'll allow your men
to rush to their deaths again?

395
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,159
看看四周吧
法语区所有吸血鬼都来了
Look around. Every vampire
in the Quarter is coming out.

396
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:16,330
他们想要收回城市
这次绝不投降
They want their city back,
no surrender this time.

397
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,238
- 你得把我们都杀了
- 好吧
-You're gonna have to kill us all.
-Okay.

398
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,805
我想那就先从你开始吧
I think I'll start with you.

399
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,882
好啊，来抓我吧
Fine. Come get me.

400
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,384
- 如果你不杀他，我会的
- 他是我的
-lf you don't kill him, I will.
-He's mine.

401
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,590
不会太久
This won't take long.

402
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,220
先生们
Gentlemen.

403
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,760
开始吧
Shall we?

404
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,238
不错
但还是不够好
Not bad, but not nearly good enough.

405
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,818
你太可悲了
How pathetic you've become.

406
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,481
炸药，马赛勒斯，是吗？
Explosives, Marcellus, really?

407
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,787
我该知道河口的爆炸就是你指使的
I should've know it was you who
detonated those bombs in the bayou.

408
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,624
码头，是我
The docks, that was me.

409
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,993
炸药是佛朗西丝卡给的
I got the detonators from Francesca.

410
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,158
你怎么不问问她河口爆炸的事呢？
Why don't you ask her
about the bayou bombing?

411
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,736
谎言，顾左右而言他
Lies and distractions.

412
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,772
我从没对付过海莉
I never went after Hayley.

413
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,637
我不是禽兽，克劳斯
I'm not a monster, Klaus.

414
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,275
我不是你
I'm not you.

415
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,019
（盖布里尔科雷亚
出生证明窜改？)

416
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,467
（葛雷拉狼人还在法语区吗？

417
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,602
我的家族在纽奥良生活很久了
My family has been in New Orleans
for a long time.

418
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,023
侧面攻击，立刻拿下他
Flank him. Take him down now!

419
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,340
科雷亚女士，我们该走了
Miss Correa, we need to go.

420
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,168
- 你的兄弟们已经从后面走了
- 还不行
Your brother's already
heading out the back.
Not yet.

421
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,120
（卡蜜来电）

422
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:58,563
石头成功了，我已经完成了我的任务
The stones are finished.
I've done my part.

423
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,531
- 现在就看你了
- 我把它们送去河口
-Now it's up to you.
-I'll get them to the bayou.

424
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,608
事实上，她是对我说的
Actually, she was talking to me.

425
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,039
这是怎么回事？
What the hell is this?

426
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,907
私下交易
Call it a side deal.

427
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,078
重点是，石头归我了
Point is, I'm taking the stones.

428
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,716
你疯了吗？
Are you out of your mind?

429
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,854
你觉得人类能对抗克劳斯？
You think humans
can go up against Klaus?

430
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,784
不，我不这么认为
No, I don't.

431
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,686
但我不是人类
But I'm not human.

432
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,104
我和你一样，海莉
I'm like you, Hayley.

433
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,298
现在我要夺回我的城市
Now I'm gonna take back my town.

434
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,604
一样才怪
Like hell, you are.

435
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,984
别这么阴沉，洁妮薇
我们都得到了各自想要的
Don't look so dour, Genevieve.
We both got what we wanted.

436
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,642
马赛勒斯
KLAUS: Marcellus.

437
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:23,880
你的名字真配你
“小战士”
How well your name fits you,
"little warrior."

438
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,353
最后却无足轻重
Though ultimately,
one of no consequence.

439
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,658
我的名字是马赛尔
My name is Marcel.

440
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,335
你的反抗没完了是吗？
Is there no end to your defiance?

441
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,771
你召唤了麦可
让蕾贝卡与我为敌
You summoned Mikael,
turned Rebekah against me,

442
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,503
试图把我埋在你的花园里
tried to bury me in your garden,

443
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,704
但你总是失败
and yet you always fail.

444
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:56,044
还能做什么呢？
只能让你从痛苦中解脱了
What is there left to do
but put you out of your misery?

445
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,722
海莉，我已经打了六次电话
回我电话
Hayley, I've called six times.
Call me back.

446
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,456
你说你想知道我是否知道
佛朗西丝卡科雷亚的事
You said you wanted to know
if I learned anything
about Francesca Correa.

447
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,294
她的家人是狼人的后裔
Her family is descended
from a werewolf bloodline.

448
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,767
我们两代人都活在谎言里
We've spent two generations
living a lie,

449
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,134
现在我们的时代…
and now our time...

450
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,866
我们的时代来临了
our time has come.

451
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,416
你们知道怎么做
You know what do to.

452
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,437
结束了吗？
Are we done?

453
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,607
干得漂亮
Nice job.

454
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,405
帮我省了亲自杀死这些吸血鬼的麻烦
Saved me the trouble of killing
all these vampires myself.

455
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,287
快跑
Run!

456
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,887
能杀多少杀多少
Kill as many of them as you can.

457
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,920
抱歉，老兄，但我有点饿了
I'm sorry, mate.
But I'm a bit famished.

458
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:26,698
你看起来很糟糕呢
You look awful.

459
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,702
我为什么还没治愈好？
你对我做了什么？
Why aren't I healing?
What have you done to me?

460
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,469
是你要我施咒的
You were the one
who wanted me to cast the spell.

461
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,272
所以我就做了你的石头
So I made your stones,

462
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,608
把它们的力量和你的血液连在一起
by linking their power
to your blood.

463
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,416
现在每次月圆，只要有狼人
使用它们的力量不变身
Each full moon whenever a werewolf
uses their power to keep from turning,

464
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,613
他们就会吸取你的力量
they will be drawing
from your strength

465
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,382
给你造成痛苦
and causing you pain.

466
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,618
我给你那么多，你却背叛我？
After all I offered you,
you will betray me?

467
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,396
看着我的眼睛，尼克
Look me in the eyes, Nik.

468
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,569
你有没有打算要给我你母亲的魔法书？
Were you ever planning to give me
your mother's grimoire?

469
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,305
你在乎过我吗，哪怕是一瞬间？
Did you care about me
even for a moment?

470
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,075
我想你永远不会知道了
I suppose you'll never know.

471
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,685
佛朗西丝卡遵守了交易
Francesca kept her end of the deal.

472
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,229
毕竟，盗亦有道
There is, after all,
honor among thieves.

473
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,333
即使他们是狼人
Even if they are werewolves.

474
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,265
至于你，最讽刺的是
And as for you, the great irony is,

475
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,100
想要得到这座城市，你却失去了一切
in wanting to take the city,
you've lost everything.

476
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:41,109
你的妹妹蕾贝卡
你的养子马赛尔
Your sister, Rebekah,
your adopted son, Marcel.

477
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:45,340
现在就连你的孩子和她的母亲都会受苦
And now even your child
and her mother will suffer,

478
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,881
都是因为你的贪婪
all because of your greed.

479
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,545
我会杀了你
I will kill you.

480
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,884
就你这副弱鸡样？
As weak as you are?

481
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,424
深表怀疑
Doubtful.

482
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,727
小约，拜托，喝下这个
Josh, please drink this.

483
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,814
- 天啊
- 求求你撑住
-Oh, man.
-Just hang on, please.

484
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,425
不！
No!

485
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:33,321
当然你并不惊讶
Surely, you're not surprised.

486
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,490
内心深处，你知道尼克劳斯
会任由约书亚死去
Deep down, you knew Niklaus
would leave Joshua to die.

487
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,658
你为什么还在这里？
Why are you still here?

488
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:43,432
我没多少时间了
不过，你的朋友也是
I haven't much time left.
But then, neither does your friend.

489
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,440
我能治好他，我会想到办法的
I can heal him. I'll find a way.

490
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,446
即使你可以
隔多久又会再次发生呢？
Even if you could,
how long till it happens again?

491
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,718
只要尼克劳斯留在纽奥良
As long as Niklaus
remains in New Orleans,

492
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,253
你和你所爱的人将继续遭受他的折磨
you and your loved ones
will continue to suffer his torment.

493
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,781
这世上只有我
I am the only man in history

494
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:06,293
能够把他赶走
带给他恐惧和痛苦
who's been able to drive him off,
to bring him fear and pain.

495
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,357
如果你朋友需要克劳斯的血活下来
If your friend
needs Klaus' blood to survive,

496
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,527
我了解如何公平分配
I've been known to spill
a fair share of it.

497
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,367
你会帮我救小约吗？
You'll help me save Josh?

498
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,877
我的确有私人原因
希望尼克劳斯受到折磨
I do have personal reasons
for wanting Niklaus to suffer.

499
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,448
不过…
是的
But...yes.

500
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,051
我非常想帮你
I'd like nothing more
than to help you.

501
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,053
我只要让你死而复生
And all I have to do
is raise you from the dead.

502
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,157
一个治愈你朋友，并且一生
A small price to pay
to cure your friend

503
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,316
摆脱怪物阴影的小小代价
and live a life free of a monster.

504
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,386
想一想，黛维娜
Think, Davina.

505
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:43,967
依然有可以杀死克劳斯的武器
There still exists a weapon
that can kill Klaus.

506
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:48,538
让唯一一个有能力使用它的人活过来
Bring back the one being
who has the strength to use it.

507
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,341
你在跟谁说话？
Who were you talking to?

508
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,311
不重要，我要治好你
Doesn't matter. I'm gonna fix you.

509
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,269
完成了
It's done.

510
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,367
交易必须遵守
A deal is a deal.

511
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,108
你说爆炸威力很小
You said the bombing
was gonna be minor.

512
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,045
不会造成死伤
No casualties.

513
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,879
我只不过想要让新月族
团结起来对抗吸血鬼
All I wanted to do was rally
the Crescents against the vampires.

514
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,044
事情不正好就是这样吗？
And isn't that exactly what happened?

515
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,417
有人死了
People died.

516
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,354
我的族人，我的狼群
My people, my pack!

517
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,221
你的狼群？
Your pack?

518
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,386
真有意思
That's funny.

519
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,931
因为在我看来他们已经
准备好跟随海莉了
Because it looked to me
they were ready to follow Hayley.

520
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,262
但现在，多亏了我
But now, thanks to me,

521
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:57,135
我们掌握了唯一能够激发新月族
we have control of the very thing
that will inspire loyalty

522
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:00,937
和葛雷拉家族忠心的东西
from both the Crescents
and the Guerreras.

523
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,947
让我们的人变得更加强大的方法
The means to make our people
even more powerful.

524
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,747
我唯一要交换掉的东西
The only thing I had to trade away

525
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:15,255
则是一个会带给我们威胁的人
was the one person
who could've challenged us.

526
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,087
可怜的海莉，真是可惜了
Poor Hayley. It is a shame.

527
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,130
女巫极力讨价还价
The witches drive a hard bargain.

528
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,405
但每一场革命都要有牺牲
But every revolution
requires sacrifice.

529
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,831
这座城市将再次属于狼人
This city will belong
to the wolves again.

530
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:37,444
我们唯一要做的…
就是夺回它
All we have to do...
is take it.

531
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,340
不…
No. No, no, no.

532
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,453
不
No.

533
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,719
不，不！
No, no, no!

534
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,052
马赛尔
Marcel.

535
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,022
马赛尔，抱歉
Marcel, I'm sorry.

536
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,332
抱歉
I'm sorry.

537
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,867
天啊，马赛尔
Oh, my God, Marcel.

538
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,875
我已经试着找人来了，任何人
I've been trying to find someone,
anyone.

539
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,742
- 发生了什么事？
- 你得离开这里
-What's happening?
-You need to get out of here.

540
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,348
我的人被狼人咬了
My guys have been bitten by wolves.

541
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,712
他们会生病，然后嗜血
They'll get sick
and then bloodcrazy.

542
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,182
我们得找到克劳斯，他的血能治愈你们
We need to find Klaus.
His blood can heal you.

543
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,882
马赛尔，她在哪？
ELlJAH: Marcel! Where is she?

544
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,694
- 海莉在哪？
- 海莉不在他手上，拜托
-Where's Hayley?
-He doesn't have her.

545
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,527
我知道你不相信他
但你知道我不会说谎
Please, I know you don't trust him,
but you know I wouldn't lie.

546
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,692
海莉不在他手上
He doesn't have her.

547
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,898
有人抓走了她
Someone does.

548
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,040
我弟弟呢？
Where's my brother?

549
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,507
我把他留在街上了
I left him in the street.

550
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,410
他本来要杀了我
He was gonna kill me,

551
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,575
然后被女巫的咒语攻击了
and then he got jacked up
by some witch's spell.

552
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,584
洁妮薇
Genevieve.

553
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,589
不
No.

554
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,727
- 把她放在地板上
- 我们应该把她带去墓地
Get her down on the floor.
We should take her
to the City of the Dead.

555
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,390
没时间了，孩子马上就要出生了
We won't make it.
The baby is coming now.

556
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:41,129
- 不，太早了
- 显然不早
-No. It's too soon.
-Apparently not.

557
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,398
计划是献祭准备好时才让她开始
The plan was to induce her
when the sacrifice was ready.

558
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,771
我不得不制服她
外伤导致胎盘早剥
I had to subdue her, and the trauma
caused a placental abruption.

559
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,208
孩子马上就要出生，我们得做好调整
So the baby is coming,
and we'll just have to adapt.

560
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,543
- 放我走！
- 你要冷静，海莉
-Let me go!
-You need to be calm, Hayley.

561
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,308
你为什么要这样对我？
Why are you doing this to me?

562
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,417
为了重生，我们必须献祭
To be reborn, we must sacrifice.

563
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,489
那是什么意思？你这神经病小贱人
What the hell does that mean,
you psychotic little bitch?

564
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,786
祖先们要求用祭品来换取力量
The ancestors demand an offering
in exchange for power.

565
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,259
而你的孩子将会是最好的祭品
And your child
will be a fine offering.

566
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,228
不，不要
No. No!

567
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,994
你们不能拿走我的孩子，我会杀了你们
You will not take my baby.
I will kill all of you.

568
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,400
不，你不会
克劳斯和以利亚也不行
No, you won't.
And neither will Klaus or Elijah.

569
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,866
你孩子出生后
我们会将她献祭给我们的祖先
When your baby is born,
we will offer it up
to those who came before us.

570
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:24,145
对不起，海莉
但只能这样了
I'm sorry, Hayley.
But this is the way it had to be.

571
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,909
不，不要！
No! No!

572
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:51,234
