真的吗? 我之前从没这么干过 管用吗?
Really? I've never done that before. Does it work?

111
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,847
你是在问人们喜不喜欢钱是吗?
Do people like money, is that what you're asking?

112
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,765
你个把MC平方(爱因斯坦质能方程)当成说唱歌手的女人
A... a lot of attitude from the woman

113
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:59,351
脾气还不小啊

00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:01,553
你觉得在这个全国啪啪节时
Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday

115
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,889
说这种东西合适吗?

149
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,992
哦 好...
Oh, uh, ok...

150
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:50,128
有一位观众打进来了
Uh, here's our first call.

151
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,547
你好 欢迎做客旗乐融融
Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags.

你的问题是什么?
What's your question?

153
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:55,751
我到底是怎么了?
What is wrong with me?

154
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,819
为什么我总是毁了自己的生活?
Why am I so self-destructive?

155
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:01,440
Rajesh啊?
Rajesh?

156
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:02,841
是我
Yes.

157
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:06,011
每次我过得很好的时候 我都会毁了一切
Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it.

158
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:08,630
你们两个人看上去挺快乐的... 你们怎么做到的?
You two look happy... how do you do it?

159
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,666
- 我觉得首先就是要多沟通  - 等等
- I think it starts with good communication.  - Yeah, wait,

160
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:13,852
这个问题和旗子没关系 下一位
that's not a flag question. Next caller.

161
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:17,906
我接下来要说的话
I hope you don't think I'm just saying this

162
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:20,359
不是因为今天是情人节...
because it's Valentine's Day, but...

163
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:22,411
我好爱你
I love you so much.

164
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,413
我要把这东西放到你浴袍里
I'm gonna put this down your robe.

165
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:29,701
它一动不动的 但我觉得它还活着
It's not moving, but I think it's still alive.

166
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:32,871
那你要不要再把它丢到那里面去放几分钟?
Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?

167
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,757
不要
No.

168
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,510
而且这不是老鼠 是兔子
No, and it's not a rat, it's a rabbit.

169
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:40,712
我们要救它
We need to save it.

170
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:42,381
怎么救啊?
Well, how do we do that?

171
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,266
不知道 你用手机查一下
Um, I don't know, look it up on your phone.

172
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:46,351
我... 我拿条毛巾把它裹起来
I... I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.

173
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:48,353
呃... "照顾
Um... "taking care

174
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,472
受伤的兔子"
of injured rabbit."

175
00:07:50,474 --> 00:07:51,890
好的
Okay.

176
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:54,226
确保它又舒服又暖和
Make sure it's comfortable and warm.

177
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:57,229
它刚刚洗了个热水澡呢 这条肯定满足了
Well, it was just in a hot tub. I'm gonna say "check."

178
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:58,814
还有呢?
Anything else?

179
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:00,065
接下来确保它不脱水
To make sure it's not dehydrated,

180
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,400
喂它喝电解质
feed him an electrolyte solution.

181
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:02,701
如果它没有反应的话
If it's not responding,

182
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:05,904
用一条温暖的毛巾擦拭它的面部和生殖器
use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals.

183
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,042
就是这样
Yeah.

184
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:14,796
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

185
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,798
我要找那个接待员去
You know, I'm gonna go talk to the maitre d'.

186
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,417
你打算说什么呢?
What are you gonna say?

187
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,136
不知道 我... 我和他调情吧
I don't know. I'm... I'm gonna flirt with him.

188
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:23,422
这样我可能会不高兴
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

189
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:25,090
反正我今天晚上还是要和你上床的
I'm still sleeping with you tonight.

190
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:28,093
看看能不能给我们争取个靠窗的位子
See if you can get a table by the window.

191
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:34,232
你好啊 你叫什么名字?

196
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:47,245
听着 我们已经等了好久了
Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while,

197
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:48,780
- 我...  - 我
- and I just...  - With all

198
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:51,750
无意冒犯 夫人 我实在是没办法
due respect, ma'am, there's nothing I can do.

199
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:54,753
别叫我夫人
You don't have to call me ma'am.

200
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:56,204
－ 其实  － 你看
－ Okay.  － I mean,

201

202
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,124
好吧
Okay.

203

205
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,184
闭嘴 Glen
Just shut up, Glen.

206
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,104
快点 我们离开这里
Come on, let's get out of here.

207
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:14,973
- 什么? 为什么?  - 因为我很年轻 走吧
- What? Why?  - Because I'm young. Let's go.

208
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:18,877
Rajesh 分手后
Rajesh, it's perfectly normal

209
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,313
有各种困惑是非常正常的
to have doubts after breaking up with someone.

210
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:23,215
你真的这么想?
Well, you really think so?

211
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,300
是的 你知道什么是不正常吗?
Yeah, you know what's not normal?

212
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:28,737
在旗子秀直播中哭诉感情问题
Blubbering about emotions during a flag show.

213
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:31,823
除非这感情是指对新西兰
Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand

214
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:33,492
改变旗子感到兴奋
changing their flag.

215
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:36,795
好运 疯狂的新西兰人 为你们加油
Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we're rooting for you.

216

No,

218
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,416
Sheldon说得对
Sheldon's right.

219
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:42,617
Emily也曾说我
Emily did say I always

220
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,669
总是说自己的心情
talk about my feelings too much.

221
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,638
我想
I-I suppose that

222
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,341
那可能是一段感情中的适当关心
could be a legitimate concern in a relationship.

223
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:52,177
也许甚至是红旗（危险信号）
Uh, perhaps even a-a red flag.

224
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,479
说到红旗
And speaking of red flags,

225
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:57,732
来看看这面来自前苏联的性感旗子

226
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,401
好极了 好极了
Hubba, hubba.

230
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,400
Kripke? 是你吗?
Kripke? Is that you?

231
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:17,869
是的 我一个人坐在这里
Yeah, I'm just sitting here all by myself

232
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:21,139
在想我会不会找到一个人和我共度此生
wondering if I'll ever find someone to share my life with.

233
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,608
最好是亚洲女性 18到24岁 不要胖的
Preferably Asian, 18-24, no fatties.

234
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:29,347
拜托 所有的评论和问题
Please, all comments and questions

235
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:31,116
都应该是和旗子有关的
should be flag-related.

236
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:34,836
好吧 我下面的杆子和旗子有关吗?
All right. Is my pole flag-related?

237
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:44,379
我不觉得无关
I don't see why not.

238
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:54,461
他吃下去了 这是个好迹象
He's eating. That's a good sign.

239
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:56,213
你要再等一个小时
You're gonna have to wait one hour

240
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:58,548
才可以再去游泳哦
until you can go swimming again.

241
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:02,719
- 他实在太萌啦  - 是啊
- He's pretty cute.  - He is.

242
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:05,639
我们应该给他起个名吗?
Should we... name him?

243
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,641
今天是情人节
It is Valentine's Day.

244
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,693
叫Valentino怎么样?
How about Valentino?

245

好啊 一个经典的兔子名
Nice. A classic rabbit name.

246
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:19,319
彼得兔 罗杰兔 Valentino Wolowitz兔
Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit.

247
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,874
看看那胸毛和龅牙
Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite.

248
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:25,659
你当然是一个Wolowitz
Of course you're a Wolowitz.

249
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,746
狗崽子! 他咬我!
Son of a bitch! He bit me!

250
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:31,715
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

251
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,049
不 我不好!
No, I'm not okay!

252
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:34,968
野生的兔子可能有狂犬病!
Wild rabbits can have rabies!

253
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,804
你为什么要把手指放到他嘴边?
Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?

254
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:40,807
判断失误 很明显啊
Poor judgment, obviously.

255
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:44,261
- 他这么小 我确定没关系的  - 怎么可能没关系?
- He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.  - How can it be fine?

256
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:47,681
我刚刚被一只明显反犹太人的野生动物咬了
I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.

257
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:54,154
这不是我们所计划好的 但也没那么糟 对吧?
It's not what we planned, but this isn't so bad, right?

258
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:57,741
简直好极了
It is freaking amazing.

259
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:00,193
很高兴你觉得好点了
Well, glad you're feeling better.

260
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,329
我刚刚只是很饿很暴躁
I was just hungry and cranky,

261
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:04,698
我之前从来没有被人叫过"夫人"
and I've never been called "ma'am" before.

262
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,199
这有什么大不了的吗?
Is that a big deal?

263
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:09,202
有点 第一次有人叫你"先生"是什么时候?
Kind of. When was the first time someone called you "sir"?

264
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:10,670
六年级
Sixth grade,

265
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:13,423
我穿着休闲西装拿着公文包 所以...
but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so...

266
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:17,544
你能相信吗 我遇到你的时候22岁?
Can you believe when I met you I was 22?

267
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:19,379
简直疯了
I mean, it's crazy!

268
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:21,214
那些时间都去哪儿了?
Where did all that time go?

269
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:25,051
你看了很多集的单身汉
Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.

270
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:26,937
是的 接着开玩笑吧
Yeah, go ahead and make jokes,

271
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,638
但你都快奔五了
but your thirties are almost over.

272
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,140
才不是呢
No, they're not.

273
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:32,058
你都过了三十五了
You're closer to 40 than you are 30.

274
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,562
哈哈! 你嫁给了个老男人
Ha, ha! You married an old man.

275
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:37,631
这样吧
Tell you what.

276
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,065
今晚我们玩点好玩的
Let's do something fun tonight.

277
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,400
这样也年轻不了啊
Won't make us any younger.

278
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:43,069
虽然不会 但是我们总有一天会老的
Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old,

279
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:44,904
等到那时再想起今晚
and we'll look back on this night

280
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:46,906
会回忆起许多乐趣
and remember what a good time we had.

281
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,908
好吧 玩什么?
Okay, like what?

282
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,911
我知道 食物大战!
I know. Food fight!

283
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,919
我继续想吧
I'll keep thinking.

284
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,809
我知道你俩都很孤独 但是
Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes

285
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:09,212
有时候一个人也是乐得自在
the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself,

286
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:11,748
尤其是在刚刚分手之后
especially when you just got out of a relationship.

287
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,000
说起分手
Speaking of ending relationships,

288
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:18,355
当英国的洪都拉斯变成了伯利兹之后
when British Honduras became Belize,

289
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:21,074
他们设计了一个画着树的新旗帜
they designed a new flag with a tree on it,

290
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:24,944
我倒是希望在那棵树上吊死
and I would like to hang myself from that tree.

291
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:32,335
但是 Amy 你和Sheldon分手之后
But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up,

292
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:34,504
不就立马开始和别人约会了吗?
didn't you start dating someone right away?

293
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:37,007
并... 并没有立马啦
Well, I... I wouldn't say right away.

294
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:40,010
而且她见了三个男人
And actually, it was three different men.

295
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:41,928
三个男人?
Three different men?!

296
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,583
天了噜 姑娘 你咋不上天呢?
Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?

297
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:49,185
Kripke好像掉线了哦
Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.

298
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:52,355
我还在呢
Actually, I'm still here.

299
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:54,424
- 还在吗?  - 在滴

还在吗?
Now?

302
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:01,798
Kripke好像掉线了哦
Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.

303
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,817
和Emily在一起之前 我单身了很久
Before Emily, I was alone for so long.

304
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,352
我不知道... 还能不能再承受那种感觉
I just... I don't know if I can do that again.

305
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,787
我这里有点东西
Well, you know, here is something

306
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,205
说不定能让你高兴起来
that might cheer you up.

307
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:13,109
马恩岛的旗帜只是个
The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs

308
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:16,529
穿着奇怪内裤的三条腿...
sharing a weird pair of underpants, so...

309
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,581
你还以为你有难处呢
you think you got problems.

310
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:22,168
我有主意了
I have an idea.

311
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,853
也许咱们的观众里
Maybe someone in our audience

312
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:25,755
有人愿意和Rajesh约会
would be interested in meeting Rajesh.

313
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:27,791
女士们 我可以担保
Ladies, I can attest

00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,495
富二代! 别忘了说富二代!
Rich parents! Don't forget, rich parents!

316
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:36,866
惯坏了的天体物理学家 不仅...
spoiled astrophysicist who not only...

317
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:41,905
好吧 倒挺快的
Oh. Well, that was quick.

318
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:44,340
嗨 这里是旗乐融融
Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.

319
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,443
我好像被人掐掉了
Hey, I think I got cut off.

320
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,630
哈喽 Kripke
Hello, Kripke.

321
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,916
我有一个关于旗帜的问题
I have a flag question.

322
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:56,119
你和几个男人啪过?
How many men did you have sex with?

323
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:00,623
什么是有趣又充满年轻活力的呢?
Let's see. What's young and fun?

324
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,592
啊 我们可以去跳舞
Uh, we could go dancing.

325
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:04,094
你真要去跳舞?
Are you actually gonna dance?

326
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:05,095
- 当然要去  - 是嘛
- Of course.  - Yeah.

327
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:07,097
没人想看你跳舞
No one wants to see that.

328
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:09,716
嘿 去海边裸泳怎么样?
Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?

329
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:12,602
算了 我不想老二给鱼啃了
No, I don't need any fish nibbling my business.

330
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,556
红磨坊上映了!
Oh, there's a screening of Moulin Rouge!

331
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:18,391
我听说观众可以合唱
I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.

332
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,026
听起来不错 几点开始?
That sounds fun. When's it start?

333
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,895
半夜
Midnight.

334
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:23,646
半夜 真的吗?
Midnight. Really?

335
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:25,448
就这样 我们去看
You know what? Let's do it.

336
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,900
好的 太棒了!
Okay, great!

337
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:30,570
等等 票卖完了
Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.

338
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,739
- 谢天谢地  - 棒!
- Oh, thank God.  - Yes!

339
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:36,242
这上面说 兔子带有狂犬病
It says, rabies in rabbits is

340
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:37,744
几乎是不可能的
highly unlikely.

341
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:39,579
－ 太棒了  － 哪里棒?
－ Oh, terrific.  － It's not terrific.

342
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:41,414
几乎不可能不代表不会发生
Lots of highly unlikely things happen.

343
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:45,251
你也见过我浴袍下的事实了 但你还是嫁给我了
You saw what's under this robe, and you still married me.

344
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:47,420
如果你实在放心不下
If you're really worried, 

345
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:48,588
我们就带它去兽医那里检查检查 这还差不多
we'll take him to the vet and have him tested. Good.

346
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,924
谢谢 有了有了 可以这样检查!
Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test!

347
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:52,926
你所要做的就是...
All they have to do is...

348
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:54,928
切开他的头检查他的大脑
cut off his head and check his brain.

349
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,096
切开他的头?
Oh, cut off his head?

350
00:15:57,098 --> 00:16:00,934
那是他小鼻子的位置啊
That's where his little nose is.

351
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:04,254
他没有表现出任何症状
He's not showing any symptoms.

352
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:07,991
安全起见 我还是去一趟急诊室吧
I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.

353
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:10,193
霍霍 你想太多了
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.

354
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:12,245
不 当我坐在了静音键上
No, when I sat on the mute button

355
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:14,614
却以为自己聋了的时候 那才是我想太多
and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.

356
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,376
我们换个时间再告诉他我怀孕了吧
We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.

357
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,285
我想表达的是 这是我第一次
I mean, this is the first time

358
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,220
和别人分手啊
I've ever broken up with someone.

359
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:40,023
我只是... 没有想到会伤得这么深
I just... I didn't realize it was gonna hurt this much.

360
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:42,025
确实会这样的
It really can.

361
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,110
宝宝受够了
All right.

362
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:48,481
这个一点都不好玩
Nothing about this is fun.

363
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:51,284
没人想聊一聊旗帜
No one wants to talk about flags,

364
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:54,821
人家都已经十分钟没说一个字了
and I haven't spoken in over ten minutes,

365
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:58,157
所以 享受你们的节目吧
so, enjoy your new show, Internet.

366
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,545
Amy Farrah Flower出品的... 陪伴
Dr. Amy Farrah Flower Present... With.

367
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,250
很抱歉我打扰你们了
I'm sorry for bothering you.

368
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:08,618
我马上就挂
I'll hang up now.

369
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,303
等等 Rajesh
No, hold on, Rajesh.

370
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:12,138
你就没有点同情心
You know, you're not being very sympathetic.

371
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,224
你也知道分手是很难的
You know firsthand that breakups are hard.

372
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:16,726
好嘛
Fine.

373
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:19,345
如果你坚持我参与这个的话
If you insist on making me a part of this,

374
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:21,731
没错 我确实知道这有多伤人
yes, I acknowledge how painful they can be.

375
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:26,336
但是 伤痛也是有积极意义的
However, pain has an evolutionary purpose.

376
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,322
它能从环境中为我们提供信息
It provides information from the environment

377
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:31,841
告诉我们这样的行为是对我们不利的
that, uh, behavior isn't good for us.

378
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,210
就像我爱上那个脱衣舞娘的时候
Like when I fell in love with that stripper

379
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,312
我还给她买了一辆普锐斯
and bought her a Prius.

380
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,717
我听不下去了
I'm just gonna push all the buttons.

381
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:45,521
Raj 你现在这么煎熬我表示很心疼
Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering.

382
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,691
当初Amy和我分开的时候 我也很痛苦
When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered.

383
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,094
就算这听上去很惊人
And this may sound surprising,

384
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:53,363
但我还是开心自己度过了这个难关
but I'm grateful for having gone through it.

385
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,381
真的吗?
Really?

386
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:57,517
是的
Yes.

387
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,771
我相信现在我们情比金坚
I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.

388
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:04,390
我也这么觉得
So do I.

389
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:05,892
当初... 我们分开的时候
When... when we were apart,

390
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:08,027
我明白你对我来说有多重要
I learned how important you are to me.

391
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:10,229
我也认识到
And I realize

392
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:12,815
当两个人相爱的时候 有时他们...
that when two people are in love, sometimes they...

393
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,951
情人节快乐!
Happy Valentine's Day!

394
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,207
我们年轻又欢乐!
We are young and fun!

395
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,531
我收回之前的说法
I stand corrected.

396
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,917
确实挺有意思的
Fun.

397
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,221

Congratulations on a successful live show.

398

还有这个有爱的情人节
And a lovely Valentine's Day.

399
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:52,197
打扫一点都不年轻又欢乐
Cleaning up is not young and fun.

400
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:54,232
这个可以有 纸屑大战!
It can be. Confetti fight!

401
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,573
不如你歇会儿吧
Maybe you should take a break.

402
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:02,991
我来收拾就好
I got this.

403
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:10,915
你知道confetti的单数形式是confetto吗?
Did you know the singular of confetti is "confetto"?

404
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:14,753
有意思 那什么时候用单数形式呢?
Interesting, and when would you use the singular?

405
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:15,920
真高兴你问了
I'm glad you asked.

406
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,973
Amy 你鼻子里有一张纸屑
Amy, you have a confetto in your nose.

407
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:21,976
不 不 不 另一边 好了没了
No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.
