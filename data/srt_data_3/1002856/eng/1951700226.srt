17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,300

OKAY?

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,000
BESIDES, I DON'T SEE YOU
IN ANY BIG HURRY

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,300

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,000
I'M LOOKING FOR CARLOS.
HE WENT FOR A RUN,

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,800
BUT IT WAS HOURS AGO.
SORRY. HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,100
REALLY? BECAUSE IDA GREENBERG
SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,200
SHE SAW HIM ON YOUR PORCH.

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,000
UH, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE
HE'S THERE! THERE HE IS!

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,300
WHAT?

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,600
CARLOS!
HE'S AT YOUR HOUSE.

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
OH,

OH.

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,900
THERE YOU GO. HE'S HOME.

55
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,500
OKAY. WELL, THANKS.

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
YOU TOLD HER

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
SO?

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
SO I'M NOT AT HOME.
I'M HERE.

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,900

AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

60

AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO GET YA.

65
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,600
OR MAYBE A COFFEEPOT

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
OR SCENTED HANGERS

67
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,700
OR... A NICE CLOCK RADIO.

68
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,300
GABY, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,400
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SURPRISE ME?

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
UH, WAIT, BUT DON'T GO!
(tires screech)

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,500
I-I NEED A LITTLE MORE GUIDANCE!

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,900
DAMN IT, BOYS! YOU SHOULD NOT BE
SCREWING AROUND IN THE STREETS!

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,400
SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET HURT!
(both yelling)

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
CARLOS!

75

CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
SOMEONE BROKE INTO OUR HOUSE.

76
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,900

91

SO WHAT DID JULIE SAY,
EXACTLY?

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
SHE SAID DYLAN'S
NOT THE SAME GIRL.

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,500
NOT THE SAME GIRL
LIKE SHE'S CHANGED,

94
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,500
OR NOT THE SAME GIRL BECAUSE
SHE'S BEEN REPLACED BY A ROBOT?
I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD,

95
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,300
BUT JULIE SAYS DYLAN
DOES NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING

96
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,100
ABOUT LIVING HERE.

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,700
WELL,
MAYBE SHE BLOCKED IT OUT.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,100
DID SOMETHING BAHAPPEN
TO HER WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG?
I'M NOT SURE.

99
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,900
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD
ABOUT THE WAY THEY LEFT.

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,300
SO...

101
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,300

GOSSIP BRIGADE.

UH, SUSAN.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
SHE'S STANDING RIGHT THERE.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
OH, MY GOD. HAVE YOU BEEN THERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

105
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,800
ANYWAY, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU GIRLS ABOUT LYNETTE.

106
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,400
WHAT ABOUT HER?
WELL, SINCE SHE'S BEEN
SO TIRED FROM CHEMO,

107
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,500
I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE
IF WE DID SOMETHING FOR HER,

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,800
LIKE BRING HER LUNCH?

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,500
UH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

110
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
UM, GABY, WHY DON'T YOU BRING
YOUR VEGETABLE LASAGNA?

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,100
SUSAN, YOU DO BEVERAGES,

112
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,000
AND, UH, KATHERINE, WHY DON'T
YOU BRING A SIMPLE GREEN SALAD?

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
I'D RATHER BRING DESSERT.

114
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,600
OH, NO NEED, DEAR.
I ALWAYS BRING DESSERT.

115
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,200

117
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,400

MY PIE PLATES,

119
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,600

125
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,100

BUT I'M FINE.

RIGHT.

140
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,400
IT'S FUNNY.

141
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,200
WE PLAYED CARDS ON OUR HONEYMOON
THE DAY THAT IT RAINED.

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,300
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
WE--WE LIT A FIRE--

143
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,500

SHOOT. THAT'S RIGHT.

147

<i>OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU LETTING ME WIN?</i>

148
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,100
I JUST WANNA MAKE YOU
FEEL GOOD.

149
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,600

T OF THE KILL?

150
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,200
HONEY, I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST...

OUT.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,800
WHAT?

154
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,000
YOU ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE DISTRACTING ME,

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
NOT DEPRESSING
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

156
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT
OF CHEMO?

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,700
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

158
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,800
HONEY, I'M YOUR RIDE.

159
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
JUST GO. I'LL CAB IT.

160
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,800

IT'S A NICE CAR.

166

167
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
NO.

168
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,300
THEN WHOSE IS IT?
(chuckles)

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,900
IT'S... YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT
TO ME. SURPRISE!

170
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,300
A CAR. I WAS GONNA GET YOU
EARRINGS.

171
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,700
SO? GET 'EM.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
AND I WILL DRIVE AROUND
WITH THE TOP DOWN

173
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,600
SO EVERYONE CAN SEE THEM.

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
EDIE, I CAN'T AFFORD THIS.

175
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

176
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,300
JUST MOVE SOME OF
YOUR OFFSHORE MONEY ONSHORE.

177
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,900
I TOLD YOU,
THAT ACCOUNT WAS A SECRET,

178
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,600
WHICH IT'S NOT GONNA BE
FOR LONG

179
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
IF I START BUYING
$80,000 CARS.

180
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,100
NOW I'M SENSING THAT
THIS LITTLE NEST EGG OF YOURS

181
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,200
IS A TEENSY BIT ILLEGAL.

182
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,700
WHERE'D IT COME FROM?

183
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,500
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT,
D THE I.R.S. DOESN'T, EITHER.

184
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
YOU WANT ME TO GO TO JAIL?

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,300
GOODNESS, CARLOS.

186
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,400
I-I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOUR SITUATION WAS SO...

187
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,900
PRECARIOUS.

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,600
WELL... I GUESS

189
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE THIS
BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.

190
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,400
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING,
BABE.

191
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,300
LOOK, IF... (sighs) IF YOU
DON'T WANT THE EARRINGS,

192
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,100
JUST PICK SOMETHING ELSE OUT
INSTEAD.

193
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,600
JUST NOT TOO EXTRAVAGANT.

194
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,200
DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE A THOUGHT,

195
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,000
AND IT'S RIGHT
IN YOUR PRICE RANGE.

196
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,400
OH! HI. HI.

197
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
HEY, KATHERINE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

198
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,600
WHY IS THERE A MOVING VAN
IN YOUR DRIVEWAY?

199
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,600
OH, I MEANT TO CALL YOU.
I, UH...

200
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,000
IT'S JUST BEEN SO NUTS.
I GOT A NEW JOB... IN CHICAGO.

201
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,800
WHAT? YOU'RE JUST LEAVING,
LIKE THAT?

202
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
I KNOW! IT'S CRAZY, HUH?

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I REALLY WISH I HAD TIME
TO TALK,

204
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
BUT I GOTTA FINISH PACKING.
OH, WHOA. NO, HANG ON.

205
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,200
LET ME JUST RUN AND GET JULIE SO
SHE CAN SAY GOOD-BYE TO DYLAN.
OH, WE'RE REALLY IN A RUSH.

206
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,700
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TIME--
(glass shatters)

207
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,800
TH-THAT'S OKAY, GUYS!
KEEP PACKING! I'LL CLEAN IT UP!

208
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,500
KATHERINE?

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,900
ARE YOU OKAY?

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
YOU SEEM A LITTLE JUMPY.

211
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,000
I JUST HAD A-A LONG NIGHT,
AND I-I HAVE A LOT TO DO.

212
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,500
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS YOU.

213
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
KATHERINE, HI.

214
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,800
OH, UH, I BROUGHT YOU
THAT SALAD BOWL.

215
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,600
OH, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE SO THOUGHTFUL.

216
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,600
NO PROBLEM. HEY, YOU KNOW,
I WAS MEANING TO ASK YOU,

217
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,900
HOW DID THAT JOB
IN CHICAGO WORK OUT?

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,100
JOB?

219
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,400
YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT
YOU LEFT SO SUDDENLY FOR.

220
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
OH, RIGHT. YES, OF COURSE.
UH, GOOD.

221
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,200
UH, IT WORKED OUT WELL--
VERY CHALLENGING.
OH.

222
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,000
I'VE GOT SOMETHING IN THE STOVE.
I'VE GOTTA GO.

223
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,200
OH.

224
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,200
SUSAN.

225
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,800
WHAT?
I'M EATING FOR TWO.

226
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,300
WELL, DO BOTH OF YOU
WANNA BE FAT?

227
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,700
OKAY, WHEN I'M IN LABOR
AND I AM PUSHING AND SCREAMING

228
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,300
<i>TO BRING YOUR CHILD
INTO THE WORLD,</i>

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
DO YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO REMEMBER

230
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,400
THAT YOU DENIED ME SYRUP?

231
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
CARRY ON.

232
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,900
MOM, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT.

233
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,000
OH, MY GOD.

234
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
IS IT ABOUT MATT'S PARTY?

235
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,800
YEAH. IT TURNS OUT
IT DOESN'T START UNTIL 10:00,

236
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
SO CAN I STAY OUT TILL 1:00?

237
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,000
WELL, UH, WELL, THE JOHNSONS
LIVE RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.

238
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,900
YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S FINE.
THANKS.

239
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,500
WHOA, WHOA. IS THIS
THE JOHNSONS OVER ON CRESTVIEW?
YEAH.

240
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
YEAH, I-I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GO TO THAT.

241
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,700
WHY NOT?
WELL, I'VE DONE A COUPLE JOBS
AT THAT HOUSE,

242
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,800
AND THEY HAVE SOME
REALLY WILD PARTIES.

243
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,700
I DON'T EVEN WANNA TELL YOU WHAT
I'VE SNAKED OUT OF THAT TOILET.
THOSE RE

244
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
MATT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

245
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,300
ALL 17-YEAR-OLD GUYS
ARE LIKE THAT.

246
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,300
THE ONLY REASON MY BUDDIES
AND I EVEN HAD PARTIES

247
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,700
WAS TO GET GIRLS WASTED.
WELL, I DON'T DRINK.

248
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,400
NEITHER DID MISSY TAYLOR,

249
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,300
AND FAST-FORWARD TO HER TYING
HER BRA ON MY CAR ANTENNA.

250
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,200
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

251
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
BUT MY MOM ALREADY TOLD ME
I COULD GO.

252
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,100
(clicks teeth)
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

253
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,500
JUST GIVING MY OPINION.
IT'S UP TO YOUR MOM.

254
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,300
UH, WE...

255
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,700
I MEAN, YOU BOTH MAKE
A-A GOOD CASE.

256
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,400
UM... BUT I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO AGREE WITH, UH...

257
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,500
AND YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU BOTH--
DECIDE.

258
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
MIKE. I'M GOING WITH MIKE.
WHAT?

259
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,200
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS PARTY
COULD BE ON THE WILD SIDE,

260
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,200
AND IT IS STARTING VERY LATE.
THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

261
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

262
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,500
YOU WANTED AECISION.
THIS IS MY DECISION.

263
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,600
<i>MORE SYRUP?</i>

264
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,300
MISSY TAYLOR?

265
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,500
CARRY ON.

266
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,800
LOOK AT YOUR LITTLE DYLAN,
ALL GROWN UP.

267
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
KAREN McCLUSKEY.

268
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,500
I BABYSAT YOU
WAY BACK WHEN.

269
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
YOU WERE A BITER.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
WELL,
I HOPE I DIDN'T HURT YOU.

271
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,600
NAH, YOU WERE A CUTIE...
BUT LOUD.

272
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,300
I REMEMBER THE RACKET YOU USED
TO MAKE ON YOUR TRICYCLE.

273
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,000
I GAVE YOUR DAD HELL
FOUR PUTTING THAT HORN ON IT.

274
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,200
MY DAD?

275
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,900
MM-HMM.

276
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
HOW COULD
YOU KNOW MY DAD?

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,400
HE LEFT
WHEN I WAS A BABY.

278
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,100
NAH, HE USED TO COME AROUND
ONCE IN A WHILE.

279
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,500
ANYWAY,
NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.

280
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,000
PLEASE LET ME HELP.

281
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,700
I FEEL SO GUILTY
JUST SITTING HERE.

282
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,700
DO NOT MOVE. WE WANT TO
PAMPER YOU, SO PLEASE LET US.
THANK YOU.

283
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
HEY, SO HOW'S
THE CHEMOTHERAPY GOING?

284
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,300
OH, NO, NO. SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
I DON'T MIND.

285
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,400
OH, COME ON. LET'S DIG IN
TO THE PIE. LOOKS AMAZING.

286
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
WOW.

287
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,800
OH, MY GOD. BREE, THAT IS, LIKE,
THE BEST PIE YOU'VE EVER MADE.

288
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,100
WELL, THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK
I DID ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY.

289
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,000
THIS IS NOT MY PIE.

290
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
(laughs) OKAY,
YOU CAUGHT ME. IT'S MINE.

291
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PIE
THAT I BROUGHT?
OH, I WAS A LITTLE SNEAKY,

292
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,700
AND I PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO TRY MINE.

293
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
WELL, DID WE
OR DID WE NOT AGREE

294
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,200
<i>THAT I WOULD BRING
THE DESSERT?</i>

295
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
I KNOW, BUT EVERYONE SAYS
YOU'RE SUCH AN AMAZING BAKER,

296
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,900
AND I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD GIVE ME SOME TIPS

297
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,300
TO IMPROVE MY RECIPE.

298
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,800
WELL, CLEARLY NO TIPS
ARE NEEDED.

299
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,700
AS MY FRIENDS SAID,
"BEST PIE EVER MADE."

300
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
WELL, THEN PERHAPS YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

301
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,400
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY FOR
EVERYONE TO THINK IT WAS YOURS.

302
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,200
SO BACK TO CHEMO--

303
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,700
HOW'S THAT BEEN?

304
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,100
YEAH, SO FAR...

305
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,800
NOT THAT BAD.

306
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,100
THOUGH I DID HAVE TO
KICK TOM OUT YESTERDAY.

307
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,200
WHY?

308
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,100
HE WAS GETTING SO EMOTIONAL.

309
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
IT FELT LIKE THE LAST 20 MINUTES
OF "BRIAN'S SONG."

310
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,600
SO... I GUESS I'M IN THE MARKET
FOR A NEW CHEMO BUDDY.

311
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,900
WELL, I WOULD BE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO GO WITH YOU.

312
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,600
COUNT ME IN.

313
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I'LL SIT WITH YOU.

314
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
I VOLUNTEER AT THE HOSPITAL,
SO I'LL BE THERE ANYWAY.

315
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
OH! MY GOD, YOU GUYS.

316
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,700
I'M SO TOUCHED YOU'RE ALL
WILLING TO DO THIS.

317
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,200
WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

318
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,200
GABY?

319
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,800
???

320
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,500
STAGED
YOUR LEMON MERINGUE PIE?

321
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,100
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

322
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,800
I'M NOT.
THAT DESPICABLE WOMAN

323
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,600
WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO BRING
A SIMPLE GREEN SALAD.

324
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
SHE NOT ONLY BROUGHT
A PIE--

325
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,500
SHE HID MINE
AND SERVED HERS.

326
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,500
WELL, THAT'S BEYOND DESPICABLE.
THAT'S CULINARY TERRORISM.

327
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,900
OH, IT GETS WORSE.
HER PIE WAS BETTER THAN MINE.

328
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
(mixer whirring)
IMPOSSIBLE.

329
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,500
IT'S TRUE.
EVERYONE THOUGHT SO.

330
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,300
EVEN ME. OH, AND THAT
SIMPLE GREEN SALAD--

331
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,200
MACHE AND BABY ARUGULA WITH
DUCK CONFIT AND CANDIED WALNUTS!

332
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
MY GOD, SHE PLAYS TO WIN.

333
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,200
I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS
TRNG TO REPLICATE HER RECIPE,

334
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,600
AND NOTHING HAS
EVEN COMCLOSE!

335
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,200
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
THIS ONE'S FANTASTIC.

336
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,900
THAT'S HERS!

337
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,100
SORRY.

338
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,100
ORSON, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

339
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,600
YOU MIGHT HAVE
TO BITE THE BULLET

340
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
AND ASK HER FOR HER RECIPE.

341
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,600
WHAT? SURRENDER?
DEBASE MYSELF?

342
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,500
BREE,
IT'S YOUR SIGNATURE PIE.

343
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,400
YOU MAKE IT FOR PARTIES,
CHURCH SUPPERS, BAKE SALES.

344
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,200
IF SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT THERE
BEHIND YOU

345
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,300
WITH HER SUPERIOR VERSION,
STAKING OUT HER CLAIM

346
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
AS FAIRVIEW'S NUMBER ONE
HOMEMAKER...

347
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,700
SHE WILL HAVE STOLEN
MY ENTIRE IDENTITY.

348
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,100
WELL,
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

349
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,300
NO, IT'S TRUE.

350
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,300
THE ONLY THING ABOUT ME
THAT'S SPECIAL

351
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,400
IS WHAT I CAN DO
IN THE KITCHEN.

352
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,200
YOU'RE RIGHT.

353
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,400
I HAVE GOT
TO GET THAT RECIPE...

354
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,800
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

355
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,900
HEY, GABY.

356
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,000
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

357
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
WELL...
I FELT A LITTLE WEIRD

358
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,900
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED AT LUNCH,

359
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,300
AND I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

360
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,600
I KNOW. DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT PIE BUSINESS?

361
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,500
I THOUGHT BREE'S HEAD
WAS GONNA EXPLODE.

362
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,100
(chuckles)O, NOT THAT.

363
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,100
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO SAY THIS,

364
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,500
SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

365
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,800
WHEN EVERYONE WAS OFFERING
TO COME WITH ME TO CHEMO--

366
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,700
EVEN KATHERINE,
WHO I DON'T EVEN KNOW,

367
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,000
YOU SORT OF CLAMMED UP.
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

368
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,300
WELL, IT JUST SEEMED LIKE PEOPLE
HAD IT PRETTY WELL COVERED.

369
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,000
YEAH, BUT BETWEEN US,

370
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,400
YOU'RE THE ONEI REALLY WANT THERE.

371
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,800
OUT OF EVERYONE,
YOU'RE THE MOST FUN,

372
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,400
AND I NEED THAT NOW.

373
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,900
OH, THAT'S SWEET.

374
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,600
BUT TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T LIKE HOSPITALS.

375
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,700
NOBODY LIKES HOSPITALS.

376
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S THE PLACE
YOU HAVE TO GO

377
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
WHEN YOU'RE SICK,
OR YOUR FRIENDS ARE.

378
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,900
<i>YOU ARE MY FRIEND, RIGHT?</i>

379
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,100
WHAT, IS THIS A TEST
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP?

380
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,400
YEAH... KINDA.

381
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,600
CAN I PENCIL YOU IN?

382
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
I CAN'T WAIT.

383
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,300
(lowered voice) PSST! COME HERE.

384
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,700
OKAY, I'LL COME THERE.

385
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,700
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME
ABOUT THE PARTY?

386
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,600
OH, YOU PICKED UP ON THAT,
DID YOU?

387
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,500
OKAY, LOOK, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THINGS, AND...

388
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,100
(whispers) JUST FORGET
WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

389
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,700
(loudly)
YOU MEAN I CAN GO?

390
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,700
SHH! JEEZ! OOH,
MIKE'S IN THE OTHER ROOM.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL HIM?

391
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,100
NO, AND NEITHER ARE YOU.
(scoffs) WHY ARE YOU
WALKING ON EGGSHELLS?

392
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,400
YOU ARE MY MOTHER. YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO OVERRIDE HIM.
I KNOW.

393
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,100
I JUST--I THINK IT'S SWEET
THAT HE WORRIES ABOUT YOU,

394
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,100
AND I WANT HIM TO FEEL
LIKE HE'S PART

395
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
OF THE DECISION MAKING
PROCESS.

396
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,900
WELL, CLEARLY HE'S NOT IF
YOU'RE GOING BEHIND HIS BACK.

397
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,800
DO YOU WANNA GO OR NOT?

398
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,000
YES! YES, I REALLY WANNA
GO TO THE PARTY.

399
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,700
PARTY? YOU GUYS STILL
TALKING ABOUT THAT?

400
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,500
(sighs) CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

401
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
UGH! LET IT GO.
YOU KNOW, MIKE AND I DECIDED--

402
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,300
NO PARTY, AND THAT'S FINAL.

403
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,500
BREE.

404
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
I HOPE THIS ISN'T
A BAD TIME.

405
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,600
I JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU
A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

406
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,700
IT'S THE RECIPE FOR
MY SPECIAL MINCEMEAT PIE.

407
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,500
IT WOULDN'T BE THANKSGIVING
AT MY HOUSE WITHOUT IT.

408
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,800
WELL...
AREN'T YOU THOUGHTFUL?

409
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,300
LET ME JUST FILE THIS
IN MY RECIPE BOX.

410
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,900
WELL, AS LONG AS WE'RE
SWAPPING PIE RECIPES,

411
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,400
I WOULD LOVE THE ONE FOR
YOUR FABULOUS LEMON MERINGUE.

412
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,500
REALLY? I'M SO FLATTERED
YOU'D ASK.

413
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,900
BUT I DON'T SHARE THAT.

414
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,200
EXCUSE ME?

415
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND--

416
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,300
<i>I EXPERIMENTED FOR YEARS</i>

417
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,700
BEFORE I CAME UP
WITH MY SECRET INGREDIENT.

418
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,900
WHICH IS WHAT?
VANILLA? NUTMEG? CARDAMOM?

419
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,700
IF I TOLD YOU, IT WOULDN'T
BE A SECRET ANYMORE.

420
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,100
IT WOULD JUST BE
AN INGREDIENT.

421
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,000
WELL, THAT, UM,
HARDLY SEEMS NEIGHBORLY.

422
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,300
AFTER ALL, I JUST GAVE YOU
THE RECIPE FOR MY MINCEMEAT PIE.

423
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,200
YES, AND IT'S A VERY GOOD ONE.
I HAVE THE BOOK IT CAME FROM.

424
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,700
THAT RECIPE IS NOT
FROM A BOOK.

425
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,500
THAT RECIPE WAS HANDED DOWN
TO ME FROM MY MOTHER.

426
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,800
WELL, UNLESS YOUR MOTHER
WAS BETTY CROCKER,

427
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,000
SHE GOT IT FROM A BOOK.

428
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,900
OH, DEAR.
NOW I'VE UPSET YOU.

429
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,500
NO. NO, I AM NOT UPSET.

430
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I'M JUST CONFUSED AS TO WHY
YOU SEEM SO DETERMINED

431
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,200
TO GET OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

432
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,500
FIRST YOU BRING A PIE
TO LYNETTE'S,

433
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,100
WHEN I CLEARLY ASSIGNED YOU
THE SALAD--

434
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,400
<i>NOW, SEE,
THAT'S WHERE I'M CONFUSED.</i>

435
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
JUST WHAT, PLEASE,
GIVES YOU THE RIGHT

436
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,900
TO DECIDE WHO BRINGS WHAT
TO A LUNCHEON THAT I SUGGESTED?

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,400
WELL, IT'S TRADITION.

438
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,600
I ALWAYS ORGANIZE
OUR LITTLE GET-TOGETHERS,

439
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,000
AND I ALWAYS BRING DESSERT.

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,200
WELL, THEN
HOW LOVELY THAT I'M BACK

441
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
AND CAN SHOUER
THAT BURDEN FOR YOU.

442
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,400
JUST... GIVE ME THE RECIPE!

443
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,400
SORRY. I CAN'T.

444
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,600
I DO HOPE THIS DOESN'T
KEEP US FROM BEING FRIENDS,

445
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU, BREE.

446
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,800
AND I'M SURE
IF YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO IT,

447
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,500
YOU CAN COME UP

448
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,200
WITH AN EVEN BETTER
LEMON MERINGUE PIE THAN MINE.

449
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
THE TRICK IS FINDING THAT
PERFECT BLEND OF SWEET AND SOUR.

450
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,500
WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY
MASTERED THAT, DEAR.

451
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
SO WHEN DO I GET TO SEE 
MY BIG SURPRISE?

452
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,600
WAIT FOR IT. WAIT FOR IT.

453
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,400
TA-DA.

454
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,300
WHOA.

455
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,200
ALL THAT SYRUP WENT STRAIGHT TO YOUR BOOBS.

456
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,200
SO IT'S NOT MY IMAGINATION.
THEY'RE BIGGER, RIGHT?

457
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,800
UH, YEAH.

458
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,900
ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT ONE.

459
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,700
MIKE!

460
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,300
JUST KIDDING.
PICK THOSE UP AND BRING 'EM OVER HERE.

461
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,500
WELL, I'D BETTER WARN YOU.

462
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,100
I MAY HAVE TO WORK THE SHOULDERS.

463
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,900
MMM. HEY.

464
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,100
THAT THING WITH JULIE AND 
THE PARTY THIS MORNING...

465
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,000
MM-HMM?

466
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,400
THANKS FOR BACKING ME UP.

467
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,100
IT MEANT A LOT,
AND I KNOW IT WASN'T EASY FOR YOU.

468
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,400
UH, YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA HANG TOUGH.

469
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,200
MM, WELL,
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

470
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,300
I DROVE BY THAT HOUSE TONIGHT.
MM-HMM?

471
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
THAT PARTY WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

472
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,400
WHAT?

473
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
YEAH, THERE WERE KIDS STAGGERING AROUND DRUNK...

474
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,500
PUKING IN THE GUTTER,

475
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,100
AND THEN I SAW SOME GIRLS RUNNING AROUND TOPLESS.

476
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,200
I'M SURE THE COPS WILL BE THERE ANY MINUTE.

477
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,600
WE NEED WHIPPED CREAM.

478
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,000
WHAT?

479
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,500
WELL

480
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,600
I DON'T THINK THAT 
YOU CAN HAVE SEXY DATE NIGHT WITHOUT WHIPPED CREAM.

481
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,000
CAN'T AND WON'T.

482
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,800
WELL, I...
I CAN GO GET SOME.

483
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
NO, NO, YOU'VE, UH, WORKED ALL DAY.

484
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,600
YOU STAY HERE.
I'LL GO TO THE STORE.

485
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,700
COULD YOU GET MORE SYRUP?

486
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,500
MAKE A WISH.

487
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,000
SO I'M DYING TO SEE WHAT I GOT YOU.

488
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,700
HOW THOUGHTFUL WAS I?

489
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,100
VERY.

490
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,300
OPEN IT.

491
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,700
"YES!"

492
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,700
NOT YET.
I HAVEN'T ASKED THE QUESTION.

493
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,400
WILL YOU MARRY ME, CARLOS SOLIS?

494
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,300
AND YOU SAY...

495
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
YOU'RE PROPOSING?

496
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH.

497
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,600
SO WHAT'S MORE AFFORDABLE THAN A PROMISE?

498
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,600
LOOK, EDIE--

499
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,100
I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU.

500
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,200
IF THE I.R.S. GETS WIND OF YOUR...

501
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,900
RAINY DAY FUND,

502
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,500
THEY COULD MAKE ME TESTIFY AGAINST YOU.

503
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,100
BUT IF I WERE YOUR WIFE...

504
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,700
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO FIND OUT?

505
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,400
OH, HONEY, PEOPLE TALK--

506
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
ANGRY PEOPLE, DISAPPOINTED PEOPLE.

507
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,600
COME ON.
SAY YOUR LINE.

508
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

509
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,600
FINE.

510
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
WE'RE ENGAGED.

511
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,000
OH! CARLOS!

512
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,400
I THINK I'M GONNA CRY.

513
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,300
YEAH, ME, TOO.

514
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,500
I MEAN, HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

515
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,800
MY MOM ALWAYS TOLD METHAT MY DAD TOOK OFF

516
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,200
RIGHT AFTER I WAS BORN.

517
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,500
SO DID SHE EXPLAIN WHAT McCLUSKEY SAID?

518
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,500
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

519
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,600
SHE KINDA FREAKS OUT ANYTIME I BRING HIM UP.

520
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,400
DYLAN, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR DAD.

521
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,400
YOU'VE GOT TO CONFRONT HER.

522
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,100
YEAH, RIGHT.

523
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,100
I COULD NEVER DO THAT.

524
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,100
SHE ISN'T COOL LIKE YOUR MOM.

525
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,600
HI. IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

526
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,800
OH, THAT MUST MEAN YOU'RE MATT.

527
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,200
I'M SUSAN MAYER, AND I'M--

528
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,100
ALL RIGHTY.

529
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,900
YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD! 
YOU ACTUALLY DID IT!

530
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,800
IT WASN'T ME,
BUT HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAN.

531
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,300
WELL, IT WAS SOMEBODY.
WHO CARES? GATHER 'ROUND, MEN.

532
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
SO YOU LIKE THIS MUSIC?

533
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,200
AH, IT'S FINE.

534
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,400
WOULD SOMEBODY JUST TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND--

535
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,000
HEY, ENOUGH TALKING.
JUST TAKE IT OFF.

536
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
WE'RE FEELING GENEROUS TONIGHT.

537
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,600
OH, MY GOD!

538
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,600
I'M NOT A STRIPPER.

539
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,300
YOU'RE NOT?

540
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,900
IS THIS GONNA HAPPEN OR WHAT?

541
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,300
BOOMER, SHE'S NOT A STRIPPER.

542
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,500
WHAT'S WITH THE IMPLANTS?

543
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,300
I'M PREGNANT.

544
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,200
THAT'S HOT.

545
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,600
SORRY.

546
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,600
SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU WERE JULIE'S MOM.

547
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,800
YOU'RE WAY TOO GORGEOUS TO BE A STRIPPER.

548
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
IF THAT'S YOUR LAME ATTEMPT

549
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,500
TO KEEP ME FROM CALLING YOUR PARENTS...

550
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,800
IT WORKED. WELL PLAYED.

551
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,300
EXCUSE ME. OH. AAH!

552
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,700
UH, UH...

553
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,900
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

554
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,900
I AM TAKING YOU HOME.
THIS PARTY IS OUT OF CONTROL.

555
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,900
NO, IT'S NOT.

556
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,400
WELL, OF COURSE
YOU DON'T THINK IT IS

557
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
BECAUSE YORE KNOCKING BACK A BIG CUP OF...

558
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,200
MM... ORANGE SODA.

559
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,100
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

560
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,700
WELL, BELIEVE IT. WE'RE GOING.
YOU, TOO, DYLAN. COME ON.

561
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,400
AND WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

562
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,300
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

563
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
YEAH, WELL, BOOMER LIKES IT.

564
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,900
CALL ME TOMORROW.

565
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,900
WE'LL GO TO A MOVIE MY MOM CAN DRAG US OUT OF.

566
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,500
LOOK, I GET THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

567
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,000
NO, I'M CONFUSED.

568
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,300
FIRST, I CAN GO TO THE PARTY,

569
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,300
THEN I CAN'T BECAUSE MIKE SAYS NO.

570
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
THEN I CAN, BUT "DON'T TELL MIKE AND BEHAVE YOURSELF."

571
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,800
SO I BEHAVE MYSELF,
AND YOU PUNISH ME.

572
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,900
OKAY, I ADMIT THAT 
THERE'S A CERTAIN LACK OF 
CONSISTENCY THERE.

573
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,600
IT'S LIKE...

574
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
EVER SINCE YOU GOT MARRIED, 
I CAN'T WIN.

575
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,200
DO YOU THINK THIS IS EASY FOR ME?

576
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
TRYING TO KEEP PEACE

577
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,300
BETWEEN A NEW HUSBAND 
AND A TEENAGE DAUGHTER?

578
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,200
YOU'RE ALWAYS PUTTING ME IN THE MIDDLE.

579
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,900
UGH. I DON'T DO THAT.

580
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,700
PLEASE.

581
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,900
EVERY TIME YOU AND MIKE 
DISAGREE ON SOMETHING,

582
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,400
YOU GIVE ME THE LOOK--
THAT PITIFUL FACE

583
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,800
THAT SAYS IF I DON'T BACK YOU UP,

584
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,100
I LOVE THE OTHER ONE MORE.

585
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,300
I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO SIDE 
WITH ME EVERY TIME.

586
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,500
JUST MAKE A DECISION AND STICK TO IT.

587
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,500
AND NO MORE LYING.

588
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,800
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

589
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,000
I'M AN ADULT, AND I NEED TO BE
HONEST ABOUT THESE THINGS,

590
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,400
AND I WILL BE... STARTING TOMORROW.

591
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,000
HEY.

592
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,100
LOOK WHO I PICKED UP COMING 
OUT OF THE MOVIES--

593
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,900
A P.G. MOVIE.

594
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
IS THIS THE PERFECT TEENAGER OR WHAT?

595
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,500
OH, THE MOVIES, HUH?

596
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,200
THAT'S FUNNY.

597
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,400
'CAUSE ONE OF JULIE'S 
FRIENDS JUST CALLED

598
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,000
TO MAKE SURE SHE GOT 
HOME FROM THE PARTY.

599
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
SHE WAS WORRIED

600
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
WHEN SHE SAW YOU LEAVING 
WITH A STRIPPER.

601
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,900
THE JIG IS UP, MOM.

602
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,500
NO, NO, WE CAN SALVAGE THIS. 
JUST WORK WITH ME.

603
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
I DID GO TO THE PARTY.

604
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,200
MOM WENT BEHIND YOUR BACK
AND TOLD ME I COULD.

605
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,800
BUT I-I DIDN'T DRINK OR DO
ANYTHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

606
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,700
GLAD TO HEAR IT,

607
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,600
AND, UH,
THANKS FOR YOUR HONESTY.

608
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,400
YOU KNOW,
THIS PERFECT TEENAGER THING

609
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,400
IS REALLY STARTING TO CHAP MY ASS.

610
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,500
I'M GOING TO BED.

611
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,900
PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISN'T
GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS

612
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,600
WHERE YOU LEAVE ME AND I GO
SCREAMING DOWN THE STREET.

613
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,500
WHY'D YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK?

614
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,700
I'M SORRY.

615
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,800
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND, FOR SO LONG,

616
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,599
IT'S JUST BEEN
JULIE AND ME,

617
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,300
AND I'VE MADE
ALL THE DECISIONS ALONE.

618
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,400
YOU FELT SO STRONGLY.

619
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,999
IT WAS JUST AN OPINION, REALLY.
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

620
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,899
I COMPLETELY RESPECT
YOUR RIGHT

621
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,999
TO RAISE HER
HOWEVER YOU WANT.

622
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
THANKS.

623
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,300

00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,999
SO WE'LL GET TO MAKE

625
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,100
ALL THOSE PARENTING DECISIONS
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

626
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
RIGHT.

627
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,100
SO CAN WE GO BACK
TO DATE NIGHT?

628
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,400

629
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,100

GABY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

632
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,700
YOU WENT TO THE BATHROOM,
LIKE, HALF AN HOUR AGO.

633
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:23,700
OH, SORRY. I STOPPED OFF
TO GET YOU SOME MAGAZINES.

634
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,200
"TOP TEN NEW HAIRSTYLES."

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,900
YEAH, WELL, I'M KINDA BALD
RIGHT NOW, BUT THANKS.

636
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,600
WHY N'T I GO CHECK
IF THERE ARE SOME OTHER ONES?

637
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
NO, NO, I DON'T NEED MAGAZINES.

638
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,500

HOW DO YOU LIKE BEING
THE FIRST LADY OF FAIRVIEW?
IT'S GOOD.

641
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,900
ARE YOU COLD?
THEY KEEP IT COLD IN HERE.

642
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,699
I'M FINE.

643
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,000
SO TELL ME SOMETHING.
WHEN YOU GO TO A RIBBON CUTTING,

644
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,800
DO YOU GET TO KEEP THOSE
GIGANTIC NOVELTY SCISSORS?

645
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,500
YOU MUST BE FREEZING.

646
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,100

THE CUTEST SHAWL IN THE CAR,

647
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,500
SO I'M JUST GONNA RUN OUT
AND GET IT FOR YOU.

648
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,400

649
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,199
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M TRYING TO HELP.

650
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,600
YEAH, IN ANY WAY
THAT GETS YOU OUT OF THIS ROOM.

651
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,399
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST

00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,600
DON'T YOU CARE ENOUGH
TO MAKE AN EFFORT?

654
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,200
YOU THINK I DON'T CARE?

655
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,200

00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,300
I'M FINE.

658
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,700
DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT MY FATHER?

659
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
HE HAD CANCER, TOO.

660
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,700
STARTED IN THE LIVER,
WENT INTO HIS BONES,

661
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,100
AND TEN MONTHS LATER,
HE WAS DEAD.

662
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,299
THANKS FOR
THAT ENCOURAGING STORY.

663
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,200
I'M NOT FINISHED.

664
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,599
THOSE LAST WEEKS,

665
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,200
EVERY DAY WE THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA LOSE HIM.

666
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,999
AND EVERY DAY, BEFORE I
WOULD GO INTO HIS ROOM,

667
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,499
MY MOM WOULD SAY,
"NO TEARS.

668
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,299
"DADDY WANTS TO SEE YOU
SMILING.

669
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,400
IF YOU'RE GONNA CRY,
YOU CAN'T GO IN."

670
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,900
sO... ON THE LAST NIGHT...

671
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,300
I SAT THERE
AND I WATCHED HIM DIE.

672
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,900
HIS EYES WERE CLOSED,

673
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,900
BUT I THOUGHT
HE COULD STILL SEE ME.

674
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,900
SO I KEPT SMILING...

675
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,500
ALL NIGHT.

676
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,700
I WAS 5.

677
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,699
OH, MY GOD.

678
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,799
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE,

679
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,500
I MADE A PRETTY GOOD CAREER
OUT OF KNOWING HOW TO SMILE

680
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,900
WHEN I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL
LIKE IT. (sniffles)

681
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,900
BUT I CAN'T PRETEND
WITH YOU.

682
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,600
NOT WHEN I'M SCARED
I'M GONNA LOSE YOU.

683
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,200
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE ME.

684
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
YOU PROMISE?

685
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,600
'CAUSE IF I DID...

686
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,900
THEN...

687
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,499
(laughs)
GOD! I'M SUCH A MESS.

688
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,400
IT'S OKAY. COME HERE.
LET IT GO. OH.

689
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,400
(Katherine) HONEY?

690
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,100
I'M GOING TO GET ADAM.
BE RIGHT BACK.

691
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,600
??

692
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,500
CAN I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

693
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,700
SURE. IF YOU DON'T MIND
TALKING IN THE CAR.

694
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,000
<i>BREE HODGE PERSISTED
IN HER EFFOR</i>

695
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,300
<i>TO UNLOCTHE SECRET</i>

696
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,000
<i>OF KATHERINE MAYFAIR'S
LEMON MERINGUE.</i>

697
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,400
<i>BUT AFTER
SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS,</i>

698
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,400
<i>IT OCCURRED TO BREE
THAT WHILE SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE</i>

699
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,700
<i>THE KEY
TO KATHERINE'S RECIPE...</i>

700
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,800
<i>SHE DID HAVE THE KEY...</i>

701
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,300
<i>TO KATHERINE'S HOUSE.</i>

702
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,799
OH, HEY, WHAT'S UP?
I WAS DOING A LITTLE BAKING,

703
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,700
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD BORROW SOMETHING.

704
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,600
SURE. WHAT DO YOU NEED--
FLOUR, SUGAR?

705
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,300
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT
KAREN McCLUSKEY TELLS YOU.

706
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,399
SHE'S AN OLD WOMAN--
PRACTICALLY SENILE.

707
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,099
SHE DIDN'T SOUND SENILE
TO ME.

708
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,400
DYLAN, MAYBE THIS IS NOT
THE TIME, OKAY?

709
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,499
YOU SAID MY FATHER
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ME,

710
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,600
BUT SHE SAYS HE CAME HERE.
HE WANTED TO SEE ME.

711
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
WHY WOD YOU NOT
TELL ME THAT?

712
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,899
HE'S MY FATHER.
I DESERVE TO KNOW.

713
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,399
THE ONLY THING YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT MAN

714
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,100
IS HE WAS A MONSTER.

715
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,600
I CAN DECIDE THAT FOR MYSELF.
WHERE IS HE?

716
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,400
I DON'T KNOW.

717
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,300
YOU'RE LYING.
NO, SHE'S NOT.

718
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,399
YES, SHE IS.

719
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,600
SHE HAS BEEN LYING TO ME
MY WHOLE LIFE.

720
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,600
<i>I'M STARTING TO THINK
MAYBE YOU'RE THE MONSTER.</i>

721
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,499
SHE CAN'T TALK TO ME
THAT WAY,

722
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,000
NOT AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE FOR HER.

723
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,400
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
THE PROBLEM.

724
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,200
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR HER.

725
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,700
NOBODY DOES,
AND IT'S GONNA STAY THAT WAY.

726
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,499
ARE YOU SURE? SHE'S JUST
GONNA KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS.

727
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,600
THEN WE'D BETTER START
COMING UP WITH BETTER LIES.

728
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,000
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

729
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,600
I WAS WONDERING
WHERE YOU'D GONE TO.

730
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,700
I JUST LET MYSELF
INTO KATHERINE'S HOUSE

731
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,400
TO GET THAT RECIPE.

732
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,100
WELL, THAT SEEMS
A BIT EXTREME.

733
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,400
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU KNOW HER SECRET NOW.

734
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,100
YES, AND IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH PIE.

735
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,100
AHH. HERE'S THE THING.

736
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,300
I GOT A REAL CHANCE AT GETTING
BACK TOGETHER WITH MY EX,

737
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,300
BUT THIS WOMAN
IS STANDING IN MY WAY.

738
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,200
AND SHE KNOWS ABOUT THE MONEY,
AND SHE'S MADE IT CLEAR

739
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,600
THAT IF I LEAVE,
SHE'S GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE.

740
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,000
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND...

741
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,900
I REALLY DID CARE
FOR EDIE,

742
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,500
BUT I CAN'T LET HER
RUIN MY LIFE.

743
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,500
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

744
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,099
YOU GUYS, WE BETTER BEHAVE,

745
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,799
OR THE NURSES
ARE GONNA KICK US OUT.

746
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,700
HEY, IT'S OUR CHEMO PARTY,
AND WE'LL LAUGH IF WE WANT TO.

747
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
GABY, THIS WAS
A WONDERFUL IDEA.

748
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,200
I CANNOT TELL YOU
HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME.

749
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
WELL, DON'T GET SAPPY ON ME.
I WON'T STAND FOR IT.

750
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,300
ALL RIGHT, SUSAN,
IS THE CAMERA READY?

751
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
YEAH.
GOT IT.

752
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
OKAY, ONCE THE LIGHT
STARTS BLINKING,

753
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,400
WE'VE GOT THREE SECONDS,

754
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,000
SO, EVERYBODY, SAY, "CHEESE"
AND HOLDT.

755
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,300
OKAY.

756
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,100
ONE, TWO, THREE.

757
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,400
(all) CHEESE!

758
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,500
<i>THERE IS NOTHING MORE DECEPTIVE
THAN A SMILE,</i>

759
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,100
<i>AND NO ONE KNOWS THIS BETTER</i>

760
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,500
<i>THAN THE PEOPLE
WHO HIDE BEHIND THEM.</i>

761
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,600
<i>SOME FLASH THEIR TEETH
AS A POLITE WARNING</i>

762
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,800
<i>TO THEIR ENEMIES.</i>

763
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,600
<i>SOME PUT ON BEAMING FACES TO
KEEP THEIR TEARS FROM FALLING.</i>

764
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,500
<i>OTHERS WEAR SILLY GRINS
TO MASK THEIR FEAR.</i>

765
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,900
MM!

766
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,700
<i>BUT THEN
THERE IS THAT RARE SMILE</i>

767
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,700
<i>THAT IS ACTUALLY GENUINE.</i>

768
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,900
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

769
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,499
<i>IT'S THE SMILE OF A PERSON
WHO KNOWS HIS TROUBLES</i>

770
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,600
<i>WILL SOON BE OVER.</i>

771
