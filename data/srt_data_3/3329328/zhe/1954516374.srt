1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,066
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
WOMAN:
Previously on The Originals.

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,671
如果我们不能联手合作
If we can't create
some sort of community,

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:06,794
那还有什么意义？
then what's the point?

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,771
不如杀掉彼此早点了事
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

5
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:09,932
如果你我都不能和平相处
MAN:
If there is no peace between us,

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,636
那你怎么能指望其他人跟随呢？
then how can you expect others
to follow suit?

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,543
这个城市的居民不会遵守这个协定的
KLAUS: The city's inhabitants
will not adhere to this agreement.

8
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,113
那个骑车放炸弹的人欠赌场钱
The guy on the bike, the bomber,
owed money to the casinos.

9
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,845
更重要的是，欠那些
经营赌场的人类的钱
More importantly,
to the humans who run them.

10
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,421
祖先们说让你活着
The ancestors told me
to let you live.

11
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,285
不管他们想要什么
我都会保证献给他们
Whatever it is they want,
I will make sure they get it.

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,552
他们要我们杀了克劳斯的孩子
They want us to kill Klaus' child.

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,993
我被下咒了
我不知道我还剩多长时间
I've been hexed,
and I don't know how long I have.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,598
我打电话是要告诉你神父死了
KLAUS: I'm calling to let you know
the priest is dead.

15
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,204
你的驱逐暂停24小时
Your exile is suspended
for the next 24 hours.

16
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,466
你可以回法语区来埋葬你的朋友
You may return to the Quarter
to bury your friend.

17
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:38,913
你好啊
Hi.

18
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,509
好久不见，孩子
Greetings, boy.

19
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,787
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：与橘同行

20
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,327
纽奥良充满着鬼魂
WOMAN:
New Orleans is full of ghosts.

21
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,622
那些死去的人总在这里徘徊
主演：约瑟夫摩根
Our dead are always here hovering.

22
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,031
当超自然生物死去后
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
When supernatural creatures die,

23
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,558
他们注定永远孤独地
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
they're doomed
to spend eternity alone

24
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,864
看着这个没有他们的世界继续运转
主演：菲比托金
watching the world go on
without them.

25
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,972
先祖女巫并不会如此
查尔斯麦可戴维斯
Of course, that's not the case
for the ancestral witches.

26
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,973
我们以另一种方式留在这世上
We linger in a different way.

27
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,338
与大地融为一体
主演：莉雅派普斯
Consecrated in the earth,

28
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,005
增强它的能量
replenishing its power.

29
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,980
那人类呢？
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
What about humans?

30
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:43,711
一些人得以安息
而另一些则不能
Some find peace.
Some don't.

31
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,381
我得出席神父的守夜仪式
I have to make an appearance
at the priest's wake.

32
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,721
你们三个回学校去
You three head back to the lycee.

33
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,226
花点时间想想那些
Take some time
to think about those spirits

34
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,524
可能仍在你身边徘徊的灵魂
who might still be walking
alongside you.

35
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,096
我不明白为什么我们要关心
基兰欧康诺的事
I don't know why we're supposed
to care about Kieran O'Connell.

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,209
因为当我们社区的一名
重要成员去世时，莫妮克
We care because when a pillar
of our community passes, Monique,

37
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,504
我们就该停火，向他致敬
you call a cease-fire
and pay respects.

38
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:10,308
或者你只是想去见克劳斯
你们俩最近走得很近啊
Or you just wanna see Klaus.
You two are getting cozy.

39
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,044
我需要米卡森家族的信任
这样我才能接近他们
I need the Mikaelsons to trust me
so I can get close enough--

40
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,620
去杀死那个孩子吗？
To kill their baby?

41
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,184
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
(SlGHS)

42
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,056
去完成祖先交给我的使命
制片：兰斯安德森
To fulfill my obligation
to our ancestors.

43
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,161
回家去，莫妮克
Go home, Monique.

44
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,912
制片：邦妮怀斯

45
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,421
嘿，在想什么呢？
Hey, Earth to you.

46
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,786
- 你的脸…
- 会好的
-Your face....
-Will heal.

47
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,984
听着，我想谢谢你
Listen, I wanted to thank you.

48
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,892
那你不如帮我把酒倒满吧
Unless you come equipped
with the means to fill this,

49
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,228
其他的废话就不用说了
no additional platitudes
are necessary.

50
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,629
好吧
Okay.

51
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,897
编剧：卡丽娜艾德利麦肯齐
茱莉普烈克

52
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,834
我心情不好
I'm in a crap mood

53
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,963
是因为我叔叔刚去世
导演：西尔万怀特
because my uncle just died

54
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,700
而大家却像过狂欢节一样疯在作乐
导演：西尔万怀特
and people are partying
like it's Mardi Gras.

55
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,398
你的理由又是什么？
What's your excuse?

56
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,868
- 克劳斯，说真的，发生什么…
- 我最近常做梦
-Klaus, seriously, what's going--
-I've been having these dreams

57
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,311
梦见我死去的父亲
about my dead father.

58
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,117
这不用你诊断，亲爱的
我很清楚是为什么
No diagnosis necessary, love.
I've already got this one covered.

59
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,585
我害怕当一个父亲
My fears of fatherhood,

60
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,384
害怕自己会像我父亲那样
给我的孩子留下不可磨灭的阴影
of scarring my child
as my father scarred me,

61
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,584
这让我噩梦连连
are manifesting as nightmares.

62
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,553
这话还真是老套
It's horrifically cliche.

63
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,722
老实说，我很惊讶
Truthfully,
I'm just surprised to hear

64
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,299
你会主动承认你即将为人父
you acknowledge out loud
that you're going to be a dad.

65
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,132
你孩子的母亲这几个月来都住在河口
Your baby mama's been living
in the bayou for months.

66
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,399
这或许不是一个做父亲的该有的表现
It's not exactly What to Expect
When You're Expecting.

67
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,243
我比你想像中更了解
I know more about the trials
of fatherhood

68
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,141
做父亲的责任，卡蜜儿
than you might imagine, Camille.

69
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,385
那你之前还做得真不错呢
And it worked out so well for you
the first time.

70
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,577
你就继续这么做吧
Why change a thing?

71
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,394
你是来归还从我这偷走的财产吗？
Well, I see you've come
to return some stolen property.

72
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,522
恰恰相反
On the contrary.

73
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,136
我决定留下这个孩子
I've decided the boy
shall remain with me.

74
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,205
很遗憾，他不卖
Unfortunately, he's not for sale.

75
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,433
我并不想要买下他
Well, I do not wish to buy him.

76
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,108
- 我要你放他自由
- 如果我拒绝呢？
-You will grant him his freedom.
-And if I say no?

77
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,445
你似乎误解了，这并没有商量的余地
You seem to have misinterpreted
the matter as up for debate.

78
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,787
好吧，你带走就是了
Fine. Take him.

79
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,791
反正他对我来说一文不值
He wasn't worth a damn
to me anyway.

80
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,259
别人说他是你父亲
They told me he is your father.

81
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,100
是真的吗？
Is it true?

82
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,342
知道吗，我父亲也恨我
You know, my father hated me, too.

83
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,584
事实上，马赛勒斯
The truth is, Marcellus,

84
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,776
家人并不只是
family can be more

85
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,786
那些与你有血缘关系的人
than just those
with whom we share blood.

86
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,655
我们可以选择
We can choose.

87
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,513
我知道最近我很少在这附近出现
I know I haven't been around
these parts lately.

88
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,776
我想这正是基兰神父想看到的
It's a testament to Father Kieran

89
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,749
我们可以齐聚一堂
举杯共饮
that we could come together
and share a drink

90
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,354
分享故事
and a story or two.

91
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,086
25年前，基兰的父亲死后
Kieran rolled into town
on a rusty old cruiser

92
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,820
他开着一辆破旧的汽车来到了这里
after his daddy died
25 years ago.

93
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,862
说真的，这家伙可会玩了
And, damn it, that guy could party.

94
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,892
当然那是在他成为神父之前
That was, of course,
before he took his vows.

95
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,902
但就算那时，他也全心为法语区服务
But even then,
he was committed to the Quarter.

96
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,835
他知道这里需要他
He knew that this town needed him.

97
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,606
至今仍是
And we still do.

98
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,211
- 敬基神父
- 敬基神父
-MARCELLUS: To Father K.
-CROWD: To Father K.

99
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,929
看来我们想法一样
Looks like we had the same idea.

100
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,732
你叫卡蜜，对吧？
It's Cami, right?

101
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,933
有人告诉我基兰的项链不见了
I've been informed
that Kieran's necklace is missing

102
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:34,672
他一直戴着的那把钥匙
我想他是留给我的
and the key that he always wore.
I assume he left it for me.

103
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,441
你说什么？
Excuse me?

104
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,147
我太失礼了
我是佛朗西丝卡科雷亚
How rude of me.
I'm Francesca Correa.

105
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,416
我接管了你叔叔的职位
当人类决策群代表
I took over your uncle's position
as faction representative

106
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,152
当时他已经疯掉了
when his mental faculties
were compromised.

107
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,157
他没疯，他是被下咒的
His faculties weren't compromised.
He was hexed.

108
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,732
被我们的敌人下的咒
Hexed by one of our enemies.

109
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,927
听着，大家寄望我来保护
城里人类的安全
Look, I'm invested in protecting
the people of this city.

110
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,901
要做到的话，我需要那把钥匙
And to do that, I need the key.

111
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,301
一定是掉了
It must have fallen off

112
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,931
他最后死的时候可经历不少事情
during the events
that led to his untimely death.

113
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,100
真是不好意思
I'm so sorry.

114
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,956
看起来真野蛮
Seems rather uncivilized.

115
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,259
在深爱的人的尸体旁又笑又跳
To laugh and dance
around the body of a loved one.

116
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,426
总比你表达悲伤的方式
好多了，尼克劳斯
Yes. Far better to practice
your process of grief, Niklaus?

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,731
否认、愤怒，还在地下室囤积棺材
Denial, rage,
and hoarding coffins in basements.

118
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,330
我先提醒你，海莉
I will warn you, Hayley,

119
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,103
尼克劳斯今天心情不太好哦
Niklaus is in a spectacularly
foul mood today.

120
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,769
滚开
Sod off.

121
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,108
这些月光戒指到底是什么回事？
What's the deal
with these moonlight rings?

122
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,547
奥利佛每五秒钟就想闹一次革命
Oliver's trying to start
a revolution every five seconds.

123
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,018
大家都变得很害怕，很生气
而且老实说，我不想再忍了
People are scared, angry.
And, frankly, I'm tired of stalling.

124
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,716
今天是和平的日子，海莉
你就好好享受吧
It's a day of peace, Hayley.
Try and enjoy it.

125
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,157
同时，还有许多形形色色的未知敌人
And in the meantime
with all manner of unknown enemies

126
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,956
正密谋对付我们家族
conspiring against our family,

127
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,089
- 你必须搬回来和我们一起住
- 好极了
-you'll move back in with us.
-Awesome.

128
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,167
然后我们又会干那些事了
你把我关进象牙塔
Then we can do that thing
where you lock me in the tower,

129
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,997
我逃跑，搞出一场闹剧
I escape, there's drama,

130
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,798
然后你们俩都意识到
and then you two both realize
that I'm very capable

131
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,406
我很会照顾自己
of looking after myself.

132
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,806
戒指的事正在进行中
我说到做到
The rings are in progress.
I will live up to my word.

133
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,605
我们会找到并惩罚
We will find and punish

134
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,304
在河口攻击你们的人
whoever launched the attack
on the bayou.

135
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,576
为了你的自身安全，你必须回来
And you will return to the compound
for your own safety.

136
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,551
但现在
我要喝完这瓶酒
But right now,
I'm gonna finish this bottle.

137
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,655
然后心怀希望
And the next
in the hopes of drowning

138
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,916
能把今天来纠缠我的魔鬼干掉
the demon that has chosen today
to haunt me.

139
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,960
干杯吧，麦可
向梦中的完美时刻致敬
Cheers, Mikael.
Impeccable Freudian timing.

140
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,098
说详细些
Elaborate.

141
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,534
你是不是梦到我们父亲了？
Have you dreamt of our father?

142
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,905
来啊
尽情嘲笑我吧
Go ahead.
Have a good laugh.

143
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,636
我敢确信，我并不觉得这件事
I can assure you
there isn't a piece of this

144
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,043
有一丁点好笑的地方，尼克劳斯
that I find even remotely amusing,
Niklaus,

145
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,082
尤其是我最近也经常梦到他
especially considering
I've been dreaming of him too.

146
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,777
什么？
What?

147
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,014
如果你也梦到他了
If you are also seeing him....

148
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,457
也许我们那些难捉摸的未知敌人
Perhaps our elusive,
unknown enemy

149
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,260
正在精心策划进一步攻击
is orchestrating a further attack.

150
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:18,203
那么想打断和平日，还有什么方法
Well then, what better way
to punctuate a day of peace,

151
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,812
比杀人更好呢？
than by killing someone?

152
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,630
你从派对上过来啦
You disappeared from the party.

153
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,334
你能不能解释一下
Would you care to explain

154
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,972
为什么你要让我们梦到父亲
来折磨我们？
why you would choose to torment us
with visions of our father?

155
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,311
你们的父亲？
Your father?

156
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,012
我没有啊，我不会干这种事
Oh, I didn't. I wouldn't.

157
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,883
是啊，我真笨
一定是另一个女巫
Of course. How foolish of me.
It must have been that other witch

158
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,355
穿着蕾丝睡衣在我们房子里走来走去
that's been parading throughout
our house in scraps of lace.

159
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,791
我知道你嘴巴很会说话，洁妮薇
I know how talented you are
with your tongue, Genevieve.

160
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,523
我劝你还是用你的嘴巴来回答问题
Might I recommend you use it
to provide answers?

161
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,293
不然我真是不舍得撕烂它
I would so hate to tear it
from your mouth.

162
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,363
虽然我很享受
As much as I enjoy

163
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,031
你们三番两次指控我做了某件坏事
these repeated accusations
of wrongdoings,

164
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,939
但这次我真不知道你们在说什么
I don't know
what you're talking about.

165
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,209
但如果你们俩都梦到你们死去的父亲
But if you've both been seeing
your dead father,

166
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,713
我可以试试帮你们找到答案
I can try to get you answers.

167
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,048
那好，去找吧
Fine. Go.

168
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,679
- 尼克劳斯，你休想…
- 去
-Niklaus, don't you dare--
-Go.

169
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,488
你不相信她
你做得对
You don't trust her.
And you're right not to.

170
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,657
只有傻子才会相信她
Only a fool would

171
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,429
但她一定希望我们相信她，不是吗？
but she certainly wants us to,
doesn't she?

172
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,094
让我猜猜，这事一定
Let me guess.
There's something of benefit for you

173
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,263
对你有什么好处，对吗？
in all of this, isn't there?

174
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:58,001
我需要一个女巫来为狼人做戒指
I need a witch to make those rings
for the wolves.

175
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,944
也许答案和合作，两者我们都能得到
And perhaps we'll get both answers
and cooperation.

176
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,446
我不知道祖先们
I don't know if the ancestors
would like us

177
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,140
是否会喜欢我们扰乱灵魂世界
messing around in the spirit world.

178
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,751
只是个简单的降神会而已
It's just a simple seance.

179
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,514
假女巫会用降神会来吸引游客
Phony witches do seances
to impress tourists.

180
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,421
那都是假的
They're not real.

181
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,826
- 这是干嘛的？
- 这是我朋友提姆的
-WOMAN: What's that for?
-DAVlNA: It was my friend Tim's.

182
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,989
来吧，如果我们不能对这种东西施魔法
Come on.
What's the point of being a witch

183
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,192
我们当女巫还有什么意义？
if we can't use our magic
for stuff like this?

184
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,824
提姆？
Tim?

185
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,919
多么美妙的旋律
What a delightful tune.

186
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,134
克劳斯允许你在法语区待24小时
(DRlNK BElNG POURED)
So Klaus gives you 24 hours
in the Quarter

187
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,834
而你却在这里跟我一起守灵吗？
and you're spending it
coffin-sitting with me?

188
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,675
不为战争做准备，不进行安排吗？
No preparations for war?
No chess pieces to move?

189
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,475
我们在纪念基兰
We're honoring Kieran.

190
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,846
就算是我们这些坏人也可以休息一晚
Even us bad guys
can take the night off.

191
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,213
或许你可以
Maybe you can.

192
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,048
但我不确定人类是不是表现良好
Not sure the humans
are on their best behavior.

193
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,588
稍早有个叫佛朗西丝卡的人
This Francesca person
cornered me earlier,

194
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,157
逼问我什么钥匙的事
asking about some key.

195
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:58,362
- 你怎么跟她说的？
- 这不重要，钥匙不在我手上
What'd you tell her?
It doesn't matter.
I don't have it.

196
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,924
但你知道
不然你就会问“什么钥匙？"
But you know
or you would have asked, what key?

197
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,338
我叫小约帮我偷来的
I had Josh lift it for me.

198
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,975
从我病得快死的叔叔身上偷的吗？
Off my uncle's sick
and dying body?

199
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,478
我是想帮你一个忙
I'm trying to do you a favor.

200
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,445
相信我，你不想卷进这事的
Trust me, you don't wanna be a part
of any of this.

201
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,677
相信你？你开什么玩笑？
Trust you?
Are you kidding me?

202
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,447
卡蜜，这事你控制不了
Cami, this is bigger than you.

203
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,057
别小看我，马赛尔
你知道什么事我控制不了吗？
Don't patronize me, Marcel.
Do you know what's bigger than me?

204
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,591
我叔叔疯了
把我打个半死
My uncle lost his mind,
beat the crap out of me,

205
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:29,785
然后死了
and then died.

206
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,692
现在我得整夜守着他的遗体
And now,
I have to sit by his body all night.

207
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,661
我跟你一起守
I'll sit with you.

208
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,699
我不是想对你撒谎
我是想保护你
I'm not trying to lie to you.
I'm trying to protect you.

209
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,665
你现在马上走
You need to leave, like, now.

210
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,237
- 我会告诉你钥匙的事
- 我不想知道
-I will tell you about the key.
-I don't wanna know!

211
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,636
我什么都不想知道
I don't wanna know any of it.

212
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,226
洁妮薇
Genevieve.

213
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,490
我问过了，并不只有你父亲这样
I asked around.
It's not just your father.

214
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,656
困住超自然灵魂的炼狱
The purgatory,

215
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,633
正在瓦解
where supernatural souls
are trapped, is disintegrating.

216
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,134
你说瓦解是什么意思？
What do you mean, "disintegrating"?

217
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,707
她说得对，差不多吧
事实上是爆炸崩溃了
She's right, more or less.
It's actually imploding.

218
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,674
我打给了一个迷瀑镇的班奈女巫
虽然很不情愿
I made a call to a rather reluctant
Bennett witch in Mystic Falls,

219
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,869
她也这么说
who said the same thing.

220
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,675
死去的人被卷进虚无里了
The dead are being torn away
into nothingness.

221
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,284
但他们可不想就这么无声地走掉
And they're not interested
in going quietly.

222
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,047
你是说我们的父亲
虽然即将永远消失
So you're saying that our father,
faced with permanent extinction,

223
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,418
但他决定用剩下的时间折磨我们
has decided to spend
his remaining time tormenting us.

224
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,184
真令人愉悦啊
How delightful.

225
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,485
往好处想
Well, on the plus side,

226
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,288
我们很快就能永远摆脱
他那可恨的灵魂了
we'll soon be rid
of his abhorrent soul forever.

227
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,590
那是多好的事啊
And what a good riddance
that will be.

228
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,962
这么说没我事了吧，以利亚？
So, am I in the clear, Elijah?

229
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,591
还是说你们俩
Or is there a new conspiracy

230
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,101
有新的阴谋要威胁我？
you two would like
to threaten me over?

231
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,967
目前还没想到什么
Nothing springs to mind
at this precise moment.

232
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,268
是吗？谢谢了
Oh, gee, thanks.

233
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,471
我得回到女孩们身边去了
I have to get back to the girls.

234
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,104
或许明天葬礼过后
Perhaps tomorrow after the funeral,

235
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,582
我们可以小聚一下
you and I could spend
some time together.

236
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,152
就你和我
Alone.

237
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,653
再看看吧
I suppose we'll have to see.

238
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,053
拜托告诉我你除了欲擒故纵外
Please tell me you've designed
a stronger method

239
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,598
还有更好的办法控制这女巫
to control the witch
than playing hard to get.

240
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,396
我一直都偏爱传统
Well, I've always been partial
to the classics.

241
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,774
海莉，是吧？
Hayley, right?

242
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,750
我猜你到这来不是来交新朋友的
I'm guessing you're not here
because you wanna make a new friend.

243
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,823
我不把恐怖份子当朋友
I don't count terrorists as friends.

244
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,051
从窃盗到勒索我都被指控过
Wow. I've been accused of everything
from grand larceny to blackmail.

245
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,684
但恐怖份子还是头一遭呢
But terrorist, that's new.

246
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,662
一个人类骑摩托车到我们河口的家
A human pulled up to our home
in the bayou on a motorcycle

247
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,130
然后把自己炸了
and blew himself up.

248
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,202
我听说了，真可怕
I heard. Awful.

249
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,930
晚安
Good night.

250
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,380
传言说
Word on the street is

251
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,247
他欠了皇宫赌场十万元
he owed 100 grand
to the Palace Royale Casino.

252
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,151
在他死后，债务也一笔勾销了
And then after he died,
the debt was erased.

253
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,087
就像变魔术一样
Just like magic.

254
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,886
杰夫是我轮盘赌桌上的常客
Jeff was a fixture
at my roulette table.

255
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,155
他的运气时好时坏
Sometimes he was up.
Sometimes he was down.

256
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,026
我不向他的家人追究债款
I absolved his family
of the debt he owed

257
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,496
是出于好心
out of the goodness of my heart.

258
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,568
随便查吧
Feel free to sniff around.

259
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,935
跟我没关系
My hands are clean.

260
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,510
我建议你注意一下礼节
And I'd advise you
to mind your manners.

261
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,305
你还活着该觉得庆幸了
It's lucky you're still alive.

262
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,643
狼人们都在窃窃私语你的事
皇室什么的
You're the one the wolves
all whisper about, like royalty.

263
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,343
如果我想伤害狼人
If I was interested
in hurting the wolves,

264
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,920
你就会是我的目标
you'd be my target.

265
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:48,493
我想干掉某人的时候
绝不会失手
And when I go after someone,
I don't miss.

266
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,213
你的发言真优美
Your reading was beautiful.

267
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,217
偷偷摸摸靠近不公平，我还在生气
Sneak attack. Not fair.
I'm still pissed.

268
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,718
跟我说说钥匙的事
Tell me about the key.

269
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,880
你不是说你不想知道吗？
I thought you said
you didn't wanna know.

270
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,083
我想说我没管它就睡了
但我根本没睡
I'd like to say I slept on it
but I didn't sleep.

271
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,694
我一整晚没睡守着被下咒的神父尸体
I stayed awake all night
next to the body of a hexed priest

272
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,921
只为了参加一场满是吸血鬼的葬礼
only to attend a funeral
filled with vampires.

273
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:03,330
所以我在想
你该告诉我那把钥匙的事
So I'm thinking
you should tell me about the key.

274
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,332
基兰告诉我那把钥匙能开放
Kieran told me that the key leads

275
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,531
对付超自然生物的东西
to something that can be used
against the supernaturals

276
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,735
如果我们做得太过分的话
if we ever get too far out of line.

277
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,678
我和基兰的关系 有过起伏
但我们信任彼此
Kieran and I had our ups and downs
but we trusted each other.

278
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,907
所以我也没管
So I let it be.

279
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,347
因为我知道他一旦想用钥匙
Because I knew if he had to use

280
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,748
打开什么潘朵拉盒子
whatever Pandora's box
that key opens,

281
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,718
一定是他别无选择了
it'd be because
he didn't have a choice.

282
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,517
你大可开口跟我要啊
You could've just asked me for it.

283
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,956
那你就会给我吗？
Would you have just handed it over?

284
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,854
- 钥匙能打开什么？
- 我不知道
-So, what does it open?
-I don't know.

285
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,263
我昨晚把全城翻遍了去找它
I turned the city upside down
last night trying to find it.

286
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,461
教堂、神父的房子
连你家族的坟墓都找了
The church, the rectory.
I even searched your family's tomb.

287
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,368
这就好比大海捞针一样困难
It's hard to find a needle
in a haystack

288
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,303
而我连针长什么样都不知道
when you don't even know
what the needle looks like.

289
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,876
而你想看看我是否知道
And you want to know
if I have any ideas.

290
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,137
所以你才来
That's why you're here.

291
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,740
我来是因为我朋友死了
而另一个朋友在伤心
I'm here because my friend died
and my other friend is grieving.

292
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,285
你尽管怀疑我的动机，卡蜜
You can question my intentions
all day long, Cami.

293
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:01,222
但我是为基兰而来的
为你而来
I'm here for Kieran.
And I'm here for you.

294
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,010
你还好吗？你看起来…
You all right? You look--

295
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,672
像挺了好几年的大肚子那样
愤世嫉俗吗？
A hundred months' pregnant
and pissed off at the world?

296
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,250
我是要说“你看起来很美”
I was going to say, you look lovely.

297
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,788
你觉得那些爆炸是冲着我来的吗？
Do you think I was the target
of those bombings?

298
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:35,915
当然是
KLAUS:
Of course you were the target.

299
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,656
如果我要对狼人开战
那一定从你下手
Were I to wage a war on the wolves,
you'd be my first kill.

300
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,926
我会把你高悬示众，供你的崇拜者观赏
I would string you up
for all your worshipers to see.

301
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,797
我想我弟弟的意思是
I believe that was my brother's way
of telling you

302
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,597
他希望你和我们一起回家
he'd like you
to return home with us.

303
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,037
或许可以换种说法，尼克劳斯
Perhaps try a different approach,
Niklaus,

304
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,870
少提点打打杀杀的
with fewer references to murder.

305
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,342
尽管我很不想把你扛在肩膀上
As much as I would hate
to throw you over my shoulder

306
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,674
把又踢又喊的你一路拖回去
and drag you kicking and screaming
to the compound,

307
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,148
但我们都清楚，为了我的孩子
我会这么做
we both know I will
for the sake of my child.

308
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,274
一个噩梦
One bad dream,

309
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,014
就突然让你有了为人父的责任心了
and suddenly you wanna be
a responsible daddy.

310
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,952
让我把道理跟你讲清楚
Let me put this in perspective.

311
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,755
我父亲生前一直折磨我
My father lived to torment me.

312
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,263
我不想成为第二个他
It is not my intention
to become him.

313
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:19,063
我不会让我孩子承受这种苦难
This cycle of misery ends
with my child.

314
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,968
你在为自己办解的同时忘了一件事
You forgot one thing
in your attempt to plead your case.

315
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,871
她不是你的孩子，是我们的
She's not your child.
She's ours.

316
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:31,640
- 发自肺腑啊，尼克劳斯
- 我真讨厌葬礼
-Very heartfelt, Niklaus.
-I bloody hate funerals.

317
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:35,514
- 卡蜜
- 海莉，嗨
Cami.
Hayley, hi.

318
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,282
嗨，我知道你不认识我
Hi. I know you don't know me.

319
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,587
我只是想说
我对你叔叔的离去表示遗憾
I just wanted to say that l--
I'm sorry about your uncle.

320
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,186
他在泥乱时期非常照顾像我这样的人
He was really good to people like me
during the storm,

321
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,129
我很感激
and I really appreciated that.

322
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,167
谢谢
Thank you.

323
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,863
你另有目的，对吧？
You want something, don't you?

324
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,735
我知道现在不是时候
I'm sorry about the timing.

325
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,639
我只是想知道，在他去世之前
I was just wondering
if before he died,

326
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,269
有没有提到过佛朗西丝卡科雷亚
he said anything weird
about Francesca Correa.

327
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,473
我想她可能和河口
I think that
she may have been involved

328
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,948
那起攻击有关
in an attack on the bayou.

329
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,143
如果你听说什么…
If you hear anything--

330
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,221
听着，海莉
我尽力不牵扯进这些事
Look, Hayley, I'm trying,
mostly failing,

331
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,380
虽然大都失败了
to stay out of all this stuff

332
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,424
但她是个十足的贱人
but she's a real bitch.

333
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,186
所以没问题，如果我听到什么
一定会告诉你
So, yeah, if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

334
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,126
谢了，再次对你叔叔的离去表示遗憾
Thanks.
Again, sorry about your uncle.

335
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,492
我也是
Me too.

336
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,277
克劳斯
Klaus!

337
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,548
海莉
KLAUS: Hayley.

338
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,684
- 让我来
- 别碰她
-GENEVlEVE: I can help.
-ELlJAH: Don't you touch her.

339
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,987
让她来，以利亚
她当过护士
Let her be, Elijah.
She was a nurse.

340
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,824
我可以施一个咒
克劳斯，从食品柜拿点洋甘菊来
There's a spell I can do. Klaus,
get chamomile from the pantry.

341
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,726
她在发
你的外套，以利亚
She's trembling.
Your jacket, Elijah.

342
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,436
她没呼吸了
She's not breathing.

343
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:03,098
我能听到孩子的心跳，但听不到她的
I can hear the baby's heartbeat
but not hers.

344
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,214
你是谁？
Who are you?

345
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,262
我想…
我是你的家人
I suppose I'm family.

346
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,666
太初有道
道与神同在
In the beginning was the word.
And the word was with God.

347
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:39,007
这道太初与神同在
生命在他里头
He was with God in the beginning.
In him was life.

348
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,170
这生命就是人的光
And that life was the light
of all mankind.

349
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,380
光照在黑暗里
The light shines
in the darkness.

350
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,543
黑暗却不接受光
And the darkness
has not overcome it.

351
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,354
卡蜜
Cami.

352
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,894
我们没为西恩举办葬礼
Sean didn't have a funeral.

353
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,558
我父母不想跟他有任何瓜葛
Our parents wanted nothing
to do with him,

354
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,965
所以市政府就把他跟那些罪犯
so the city had him buried out here

355
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,129
还有无名氏葬在了一起
with the criminals
and the John Does.

356
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,707
都是没人爱的人
The great unloved.

357
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,444
你说你来看过我们家族的墓
You said you checked
my family's tomb

358
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,670
但我一直在想
but I've been thinking.

359
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,802
一直以来，我不知道
All this time, I wondered

360
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,209
为什么基兰不把西恩
why Kieran
didn't have Sean interred

361
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,907
和他的家人葬在一起
where he belonged, with the family.

362
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,041
但我突然意识到
But then I realized,

363
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,711
会不会是他找到了机会
what if he saw an opportunity

364
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,323
将他不想被人发现的东西藏起来？
to hide something he didn't want
anyone else to find?

365
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,892
卡蜜，我们改天再说吧
Cami, we can do this another time.

366
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,325
正因为今天不是时候
Bad timing is the theme of the day.

367
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,226
（西恩欧康诺
光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光）

368
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,663
我需要一把大槌
I'm going to need a sledgehammer.

369
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,568
醒醒
Come on.

370
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,650
她还是没有呼吸
没用
She's still not breathing.
It's not working.

371
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,285
看来我已经声名远播了
I assume my reputation precedes me.

372
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:03,121
这是噩梦，我在做梦
This is a nightmare.
I'm dreaming.

373
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:08,460
恰恰相反，亲爱的
这一切非常真实
On the contrary, my darling.
This is very real.

374
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,898
欢迎来到我的地狱
(GASPS)
Welcome to my hell.

375
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,936
永远困在这里
Stuck in an eternity

376
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,936
看着那个恐怖的生物
of watching over
that hideous creature

377
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,507
我的孩子还叫他兄弟
my children call brother.

378
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:21,203
你已经死了
我怎么会在这里？
You're dead.
How can I be here?

379
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,339
我的天啊
不，不
Oh, my God.
No! No!

380
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,974
- 孩子
- 孩子？
-The baby.
-The baby?

381
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,643
那孩子从来就不该活着
That kid never had a chance.

382
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,621
你是嫌你的血统还不够肮脏
And as if your bloodline
isn't filth enough,

383
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,215
要用克劳斯的血来污染一下吗？
you poison it
by merging it with Klaus'?

384
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,797
那个杀不死的畜牲还妄想做爸爸
The deathless vermin
fancying himself a daddy.

385
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,172
她没死，我也没死
She's not dead.
I'm not dead.

386
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,434
如果我死了，你就不用费力杀我了
If I was dead,
you wouldn't be trying to kill me.

387
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,279
我要带她去找真正的医生
I'm taking her to a real doctor.

388
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,813
如果你动她，我的咒语就会失效
If you move her from here,
my spell will break.

389
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,576
没有足够的时间送她去医院了
There won't be enough time
to get her to a hospital.

390
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,686
如果现在取出孩子，孩子会没事吗？
Will the baby survive
if delivered now?

391
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,380
- 我自己把她抓出来就行
- 那样海莉会失血而死
-I'll rip it out of her myself.
-Hayley will bleed to death.

392
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,986
- 我不能失去孩子
- 谁都不能失去
-I won't lose that baby.
-I won't lose either of them.

393
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,700
我知道该怎么做
去拿我的包包，符咒袋，快点
I know what to do. Get my bag.
The gris-gris pouch. Now!

394
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,672
你已经死了，麦可
你的儿子打败了你
You're dead, Mikael.
Your son already beat you.

395
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,641
他不是我儿子
He is not my son!

396
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,737
他是个祸害
一个彻头彻尾的孬种
He's a scourge,
a walking symbol of weakness!

397
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,945
你肚子里的那个孽种没救的
There is no saving that atrocity
festering in your womb.

398
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,615
总有一天克劳斯会毁掉它
Klaus will destroy it
one way or another.

399
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,252
不如现在就让它死，你也一同作陪
Better he dies now
and you along with it.

400
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,239
我女儿比克劳斯幸运多了
My daughter has an advantage
Klaus never had.

401
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,247
她永远，永远都不会认识你
She will never, ever know you.

402
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,443
海莉
Hayley.

403
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,286
你没事，亲爱的，你没事了
You're all right, love.
You're all right.

404
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,718
我见到他了，他想杀我
I saw him, and he tried to kill me.

405
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,964
我见到麦可了
I saw Mikael.

406
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:40,015
你的生命力还真强啊，小狼
You've proved quite resilient,
little wolf.

407
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,815
你们两个都是战士
Fighters, both of you.

408
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:47,584
我们别无选择，特别是最近
I guess we've had to be,
especially lately.

409
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,160
我决定要搬回来
I've decided
that I'm going to move back in.

410
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,596
可算让我松了口气
Well, I'm relieved to hear it.

411
00:28:55,734 --> 00:29:00,330
但别派人监视我
也别对我下指导棋
But no mouth-breathing bodyguards,
no telling me what to do.

412
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,431
我只要求孩子安全
All I ask
is that the child is kept safe.

413
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,012
那我的安全呢？
她出生以后呢？
And what about me?
What happens after she's born?

414
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,943
你要是想把她从我身边抢走，我…
If you try to take her away from me,
l--

415
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,605
跟我来，好吗？
Come with me, hmm?

416
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,411
来吧，我有东西要给你看
Please.
I want to show you something.

417
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:40,900
不管你信不信，海莉
Believe it or not, Hayley,

418
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,105
其实我很希望你留在这里
I would actually like you
to be here.

419
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:50,677
我们的女儿应该由父母共同养大
在自己的家成长
Our daughter should be raised
by her parents in her family home.

420
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,847
你、我、以利亚和这个奇迹般的孩子
You, me, Elijah,
and the miracle baby

421
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,390
生活在一个屋檐下
all under one roof.

422
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,585
听起来像是个糟糕的实境秀
Sounds like a bad reality show.

423
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,664
你说你见到了我父亲
You said you saw my father.

424
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,567
你为什么要叫他父亲？
他不是你的亲生父亲
Why do you call him that?
He's not your real dad.

425
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,673
他所造成的伤害只有父亲能做到
He's done damage
only a father could do.

426
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,003
他跟你说什么了？
What did he say to you?

427
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,754
都是胡说
Nothing true.

428
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,260
海莉和孩子都没事
Hayley and the baby are fine.

429
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,024
等她休息好了，我可以带她去看医生
I'd take her to a doctor
when she's gotten some rest,

430
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,758
如果你想的话，不过她没事了
if you want,
but she's in the clear.

431
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,538
我自己出去吧
I'll see myself out.

432
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,436
洁妮薇
Genevieve.

433
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,712
多谢你的帮忙
Thank you for your help.

434
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,979
不客气
You're welcome.

435
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,317
你把我妹妹与家人分开
You tore my sister from my family.

436
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,990
我无法原谅你这一点
I cannot forgive that.

437
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,962
不过，我决定对你仁慈一点
However, I may be inclined
to show a degree more kindness

438
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,694
只要你答应帮我一个小忙
if you were to help me
with a slight...issue.

439
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,394
- 请说
- 孩子出生后
-Anything--
-When the baby arrives,

440
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,131
海莉在月圆时又会开始变身
Hayley will once again transform
with a full moon.

441
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,469
我想为她做一份礼物
Now, I would like to create
for her a gift,

442
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:56,205
一枚带有魔力的戒指
可以阻止这个诅咒的戒指
a ring of empowerment,
something to control this curse.

443
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,712
什么样的咒语能够…
What kind of spell would--?

444
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,945
我母亲的咒语可以
在她的魔法书里有
A spell of my mother's,
from her grimoire.

445
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:07,321
据我所知
你非常渴望那本魔法书
Which, as I understand,
you've been rather eager to obtain.

446
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,105
一定是有人先拿走了
Someone must have gotten to it.

447
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,175
应该不是
I don't think so.

448
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,625
我哥哥15年前教过我这个密码
My brother taught me this code
15 years ago.

449
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,955
我不知道他怎么学会的
I never knew how he learned it.

450
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:48,122
- 你能告诉我什么意思吗？
- 我可以
-You can tell me what that says?
-I can.

451
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,791
但我不会说的，抱歉
But I won't. I'm sorry.

452
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,029
- 卡蜜，你这样太…
- 危险，我知道
-Cami, this is too--
-Dangerous. Yeah. I got it.

453
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,232
但如果是基兰教了西恩这个
But if Kieran taught Sean this,

454
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,504
我哥哥早就注定要卷入这一切
my brother was meant
to be brought into it all along.

455
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,814
现在这是我的责任了
That makes it
my responsibility now,

456
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,509
不管我乐不乐意
whether I like it or not.

457
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,954
你到底对海莉做了什么？
What the hell did you do to Hayley?

458
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,785
我只是做祖先们要求的事
I was trying to do
what the ancestors asked.

459
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,722
那个孩子也有女巫的血统
That baby is part witch.

460
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,055
祖先们想把她献祭给大地
The ancestors want her consecrated
to the earth

461
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,993
这样她的魔法就能为我们提供能量
so her magic can fuel our community.

462
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,964
她必须先出生然后再死
She has to be born first
before she can die.

463
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,730
滚
我不想看到你
Leave.
I don't wanna look at you.

464
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,516
别逼我这么做
她只是个孩子
Don't make me do this.
She's a baby.

465
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,427
别让我变成残忍的人
Don't make me a monster.

466
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,155
求求你
Please.

467
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,132
不
No.

468
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,885
不，不
No. No.

469
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:25,121
对不起，对不起
对不起，我会做的
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'll do it.

470
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,731
你想要什么我都会做的
I'll do whatever you want.

471
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,579
海莉同意回来和我们一起住了
Hayley has agreed
to return home to us.

472
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,753
自愿的
Of her own freewill.

473
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:06,368
麦可真的消失后
你觉得我能找到安宁吗？
When Mikael is truly gone,
do you think then I'll find peace?

474
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,529
我当然希望如此
I certainly hope so.

475
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,609
尽管让你困扰的不只我们父亲
尼克劳斯
Although it's not only our father
that haunts you, Niklaus.

476
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,447
你也许会想和生者言归于好
You might want to make peace
with the living.

477
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,489
我要知道为什么他们还不能自由
I demand to know why their freedom
has not been granted.

478
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,354
当权者都支持让他们自由了
All necessary authorities
have ruled in their favor.

479
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,826
你以为我不记得你吗，小子？
You think I don't remember you, boy?

480
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,999
他们把你变成他们的一员了吗？
Have they turned you
into one of them yet?

481
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,232
我想是没有
I thought not.

482
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:09,827
- 来，让我治愈你
- 不
-Here. Let me heal you.
-No.

483
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,727
你总是说我们可以选择自己的家人
You've always said
we choose our family.

484
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,670
我对你来说是什么，克劳斯？
So, what am I to you, Klaus?

485
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:22,108
你用匕首封住你妹妹时对我许下承诺
You made me a promise
when you daggered your sister.

486
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,806
现在终于是做选择的时候了
It's finally time to make a choice.

487
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:29,045
现在转变我吧
或者就让我死去
Turn me now.
Or let me die.

488
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,122
你不知道你在要求我做什么
You do not know
what you ask of me.

489
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,417
变得和我一样
Becoming like me.

490
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,462
会夺走你所有善良的一面
It would rob you of all
that makes you good.

491
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:44,466
我知道你是什么
你是什么样的人
I know what you are.
Who you are.

492
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,399
这就是我想要的
This is what I want.

493
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,139
求求你
Please.

494
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,804
钟响时你的假期就结束了
Your furlough ends
when the clock strikes.

495
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,609
我知道，别担心
I'm aware. Don't worry.

496
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,184
那时我就会离这里远远的了
I intend to be far away from here
by then.

497
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,846
但我只是在河对岸
But just because
I'm across the river

498
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,719
不代表我就玩完了
doesn't mean
I'm out of the game.

499
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,388
月圆之日就要来了
A full moon's coming.

500
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,223
我知道你和狼人计划着什么
I know you're up to something
with the wolves.

501
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,629
我绞尽脑汁想要猜出是什么
And I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out what.

502
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:54,295
不管我怎么想
结局都是我和我的人会死
And any way I do the math,
it ends with me and my guys dead.

503
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,569
或许我们该站成一排
Or maybe we're supposed
to fall in line,

504
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,678
再一次宣誓效忠于你
pledge our allegiance to you
all over again.

505
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:06,146
那么如果我们被咬了
你也许会屈尊治愈我们
So if we get bitten,
you might deign to cure us.

506
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,514
这就是你的目的吗？
Is that what you're after?

507
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,450
想都别想
Because it's not gonna happen.

508
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,853
那是你的选择
Well, that will be your choice,

509
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,222
正如你选择把我父亲带到这里
just as you chose
to bring my father to town.

510
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,293
你比任何人都了解
You, who knows better than anyone

511
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:23,093
被父亲憎恶的痛苦
the specific agony
of a father's hatred.

512
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,532
- 克劳斯
- 我花了数十年
-Klaus--
-I spent decades

513
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,161
试图弥补你父亲所做的一切
trying to make up
for what your father did.

514
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,841
我是怎么让你失望的？
How did I fail?

515
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,378
也许是伤得太深了
Maybe the scars
just ran too deep.

516
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,947
晚安，马赛勒斯
Good night, Marcellus.

517
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,587
你没让我失望
You didn't fail me.

518
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,759
你养育了我
You raised me.

519
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,192
你教会了我一切
You taught me everything
that I know.

520
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,031
你教会我
我不能够软弱
You taught me
that I can't afford to be weak,

521
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,230
特别是在我的敌人更加强大的时候
not when my enemies are stronger.

522
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,432
所以不管你和狼人在密谋着什么
So, whatever it is
you got coming with the wolves,

523
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,203
你要知道，我会为了我的人奋战
just know
that I'm gonna fight for my guys.

524
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:11,941
我会为了我的城市奋战
我会一直奋战到最后一刻
I'm gonna fight for my city.
And I will fight until I am dead.

525
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,281
我想你也会这么做的
I would expect nothing less.

526
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:47,784
如果我死了，而有人办派对庆祝
我会气疯的
If I died and someone threw a party,
I would be so pissed.

527
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,262
你差点就死了
You almost did.

528
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,259
一千年来，我想不起哪一次
In a thousand years,
I can't recall a time

529
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,932
有这么害怕过
I've felt so...frightened.

530
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,080
以利亚
Elijah.

531
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,601
提姆，是你吗？
Tim, is that you?

532
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,236
你是谁？
Who are you?

533
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,679
你朋友提摩西已经往前走了，黛维娜
Your friend Timothy
has moved on, Davina.

534
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,783
我真的很抱歉我儿子对他做的事
I'm truly sorry
for what my son did to him.

535
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,285
你是克劳斯的父亲
You're Klaus' father.

536
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:38,122
我是唯一一个能让你永远摆脱他的人
And I'm the only one
who can rid you of him forever.

537
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,127
但首先，我的小女巫
我需要你
But first, my little witch,
I need you.

538
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,426
我能做什么？
What can I do?

539
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,207
你能让我复活
You can bring me back to life.

540
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:56,344
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
