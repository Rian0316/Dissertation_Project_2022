137
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,442
我宁愿去威尼斯 明白了?
I'd go to Venice.Do you understand?

138
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,444
- 懂了 - 好的
- Perfectly. - Good.

139
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,044
有些时候她还好
Some days she's fine.

140
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:10,052
然而 有时会突然降雾 她就开始困惑,烦恼
Then,suddenly,the fog will come down and she gets confused,upset.

141
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,330
她会好起来吗?
She will get better?

142
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,607
那是局部脑损伤 Mickey
It's partial brain damage,Mickey.

143
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:28,203
你一直在支撑着这个家?
And you've been paying for that home all this time?

144
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:31,887
是的 直到下周末
Yeah,until the end of next week.

145
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:34,569
那时钱就花光了
Then the money runs out.

146
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:37,531
然后会怎样?
Then what happens?

147
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:42,163
- 有些便宜点的地方 - 不行 不能让June去
- There are cheaper places. - No way.Not for June.

148
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,322
我记得你俩结婚的时候
I remember when you two married.

149
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:53,167
那是我们从不曾做过的事
It just wasn't something we ever did.

150
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,327
你和Rachel结婚了
Well,you married Rachel.

151
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:58,883
是的 我知道 但是你知道她不是我们一伙的
Yeah,I know.But she wasn't one of us,you know.

152
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,329
我还记得你说过:
And I remember what you said:

153
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:06,611
"仅仅是因为我们做自己所做的 并不意味着我们必须孤独"
"Just because we do what we do doesn't mean we have to be lonely."

154
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,603
我羡慕你可以那样说
I admired you for saying that.

155
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,648
你准备给他们几个说吗?
Are you going to tell the others?

156
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,602
她在那里会得到最好的照顾的 Ash...
She's going to get the best care there is,Ash...

157
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:22,332
那也意味着我们将需要一大笔钱
which means we're going to need a lot of money.

158
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:26,406
别烦恼了 Albert正在外面跑业务
But don't worry.Albert is out there doing the business.

159
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:28,211
我们都会好起来的
We'll be all right.

160
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:33,046
Katherine Winterborn是只超级怪物
Katherine Winterborn is an ogre of gargantuan amplitude.

161
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,043
你仍认为她是我们的目标?
You still think she's our mark?

162
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,249
她富有 她怀恨在心...
She's rich,she's bitter...

163
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,689
只要用对了方法 她就会像蝴蝶一样展开
and with the right key,she'll open up like a butterfly.

164
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:42,967
她有情人吗?
Any boyfriends?

165
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,442
不 至少我们对其一无所知
No.At least none that we know of.

166
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:48,327
那会像与尼罗河鳄鱼睡觉一样
That would be like sleeping with a Nile crocodile.

167
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,563
好的 那么该你出场了
Well,there's your in,then.

168
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:52,804
- 你这样想? - 我确定
- You think? - I know.

169
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,526
用什么 性爱?
What,sex?

170
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,484
等等 请等一下
Wait.Please,just a second.

171
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,928
June对我来说意味着很多 我证实...
June means a lot to me.I proved that...

172
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,964
不 不由你做 Albie
No,not you,Albie.

173
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:07,892
你那样玷污你的贞操太不值了
You're far too precious to be sullied in that way.

174
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:11,010
抱歉 把你的裤子穿好 我准备来硬的了
Sorry,put your trousers on.I'm ready and I'm bang up for it.

175
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:15,769
不 我们不会让孩子来做男人的事 对吧 Michael?
No,we don't send boys to do a man's job.Right,Michael?

176
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:16,888
不 我们不会
No,we do not.

177
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:19,931
Mickey能施展他的魅力并且不脱下裤子
Mickey can spin his charm and still keep his trousers on.

178
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,446
那是他伟大的天赋
It's his great gift.

179
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,321
你两个回温泉旅馆去 尽你们所能收集所有的信息

他让我告诉你 他在地平线休息室等你
He said to say to meet you in the Horizon Lounge.

183

- 楼梯在哪里? - 那可是在40层 夫人

- 我听说电梯中间出了问题 - 什么?

我们接到责任经理报告说是左中央电梯出现颤抖
We got a report from the duty manager that the left central lift was juddering.

187

阳光照在河水的涟漪上 河水幽绿而凉爽
The sun is dappling the water.The water is dark green and very cool.

209

他在一架电梯里全神贯注工作了三个小时 不通风 没有空调
He got stuck in a lift for three hours.No ventilation,no air con.

当我23岁时怀过孕

他威逼我直到我流产
He bullied me until I had an abortion.

532
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:46,044
他就是那样对我的

00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:47,408

00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:42,572
这样做对你来说是不好的
It's just not the right thing for you to do.

548
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:44,931
我不明白
I don't understand.

但我不会让你成为我们的目标 我不会那样做
But I will not let you be our mark.I won't be a part of it.

564
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,708
等等
Wait.

565
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,475
你在骗我
You were setting me up.

566
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,028
是的
I was.

567
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,429
你们是为了诈骗钱财 你是那样说的?
You con people for money,that's what you're saying?

568
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,468
你们都是一样的 你们都一样
You're all the same,all of you.

569
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,193
20万英镑
200,000.

570
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,631
- 我会给你20万英镑 - 没有温泉旅馆
- I'll give you 200,000. - There is no spa.

571
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:22,754
谁在跟你说温泉了?我要你去把我前夫整垮
Who said anything about a spa?I want you to destroy my ex-husband.

572
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,071
狗咬狗
A rat to catch a rat.

573
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:29,232
- 别这样做 - 你出价多少 卑鄙的家伙 25万?
- Don't do this. - 250,000.What's your price,scumbag?

574
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:31,398
我想看着他蒙羞
I want to see him humiliated.

575
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,190
不 我们做那样做的
No,it's not what we do.

576
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,430
我们只骗下流的人
It's one thing conning a nasty piece of work.

577
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,589
她是个下流的家伙
She is a nasty piece of work.

578
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:42,069
为了报酬而破坏一个人的生活是完全不一样的
It's quite another destroying a man's life for a fee.

579
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,390
她想整垮的那个家伙又如何?
What's this bloke like she wants to destroy?

580
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:48,518
- 他还不错 有点自大 但... - 实际上 他并不让人满意
- He's all right.A bit full of himself,but... - No,he's not pleasant,actually.

581
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,157
迫使她流产...
Forced her to have an abortion...

582
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,037
跟着一个年轻模特跑了 并且很快地让她怀孕

583
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,030
- 你甚至没有见过他 - 我了解他这种人
- You haven't even met him. - I know his type.

584
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,552
我们为什么在谈论他?
Then why are we talking about it?

585
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,870
如果他那样坏 听起来他跟其他骗子没什么区别
If he's that bad,he doesn't sound any different from any other con.

586
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,312
而且还要考虑June的事
And there's June to think about.

587
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,311
不 她不想我们为她做什么
No,she wouldn't want us to do anything just because of her.

588
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,991
尽管如此我会做的
I would,though.

589
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,072
好吧 那么我们要快点行动起来
Okay,then we have to move fast.

590
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,990
还有两天他就要把产业发行上市了
He's floating his business in two days.

591
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,876
- 那时我们要搞定他 - 弱点是什么?
- That's when we get him. - What's the in?

592
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,712
我不知道 他是个对所有帐目都非常谨慎的人
I have no idea.He's a very careful man,by all accounts.

593
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:20,393
- 女人? - 他有过两个女人
- Women? - He's had two in his whole life.

594
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,468
报复
Revenge.

595
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,312
如果我们让他知道他妻子设法让他破产...
If we let him know his wife is setting him up for a fall...

596
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:25,957
我们可能用那种方式引他上钩
we might hook him in that way.

597
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,314
- 我不想把她卷进来 - 血腥的地狱 Mickey
- I don't want her involved. - Bloody hell,Mickey.

598
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:31,709
一定还有些破绽 他内部的破绽
There must be something.A hole in his wall.

599
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:35,307
我们没有太多时间来调查
We don't have very long to find it.

600
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,352
你不能小声点吗?
You wanna keep your voice down?

601
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:47,670
伟大的Danny Blue花钱嫖俄罗斯妓女
The great Danny Blue paid for it with a Russian hooker.

602
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,196
- 用了多少钱 Danny? - 你就不能闭嘴吗?
- How much was it,Danny? - Can you please just shut up?

603
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,314
那足够了吗?
Is it enough?

604
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:55,391
他的温泉旅馆里面在卖淫?
A prostitution racket being run from his hotel spa?

605
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,668

00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:59,193
- 那现在该怎么做? - 我们需要证据
- So what do we do now? - We need proof.

607
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:06,915
不 不行
No.No way.

608
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:09,559
得了 你做过一次了 有什么区别呢?
Come on,you did it once.What's the difference?

609
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,675
我那时不知道她是个妓女
I didn't know she was a hooker then,did I?

610
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,229
我得为名誉着想
I've got a reputation to think of.

611
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,391
人终归一死的 Danny
Every silver cane has a grubby end,Danny.

- 不 - Danny 我们需要你

614
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,317
如果你不能从这个女人那里得到些具体的...
If you can't get something concrete from this woman...

615
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:31,594
整个计划就会失败
this whole thing falls down.

616
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,992
