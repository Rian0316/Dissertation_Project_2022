00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:03,227
NARRATOR: Kids,
Barney's mom had this blouse

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:05,362
<i>that she absolutely loved,</i>

3
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:07,030
<i>but then Robin won it</i>
<i>in a poker game,</i>

4
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:09,199
<i>which led</i>
<i>to some slight awkwardness.</i>

5
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:13,069
You won the battle...
but I'll win the war.

6
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:14,905
Game on, bitch.

7
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:18,458
BARNEY: <i>Please, Mom,</i>
<i>I need you to just be cool.</i>

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,010
Okay, can you do that for me?

9
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:21,077
For you, yes.

10
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,578
And for Robin?

11
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,964
(scoffs)
She's gonna be

12
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:25,915
your daughter in 33 hours.

13
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:26,883
Daughter in <i>law.</i>

14
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:28,134
Making it illegal

15
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,136
for you not
to treat her like a daughter.

16
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:31,855
In-lawyered.

17
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:33,756
Please, Mom.

18
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:36,526
All Robin wants to do is
put this whole thing behind her

19
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:39,396
so she can get married and
put this whole thing behind her.

20
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:41,281
Ah! Get-this-over-with-quickly
so-we-can

21
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:44,200
move-past-how-awkward-it-was
that-I-just-said-that five!

22
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:46,369
Fine. If Robin's ready
to bury the hatchet,

23
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:49,039
then I guess
I'm ready to bury the hatchet.

24
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,741
Morning, bitches.
Like my new blouse?

25
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:53,743
Oh, hell, <i>no!</i>
No, Mom. Mom!

26
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:54,995
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:09,959
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, not far</i>
<i>from the Farhampton Inn,</i>

30
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,977
<i>there's a lighthouse.</i>

31
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,795
<i>It's a really special place,</i>

32
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:15,432
<i>and that morning</i>
<i>I wanted to see it for myself.</i>

33
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:16,683
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

34
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:18,968
Look, I'm sorry, Ted, but-but

35
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,637
I can't in good faith send
a lonely guy like yourself

36
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,823
to the top
of a very romantic,

37
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:26,743
and more to the point,
a very tall lighthouse.

38
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,644
(whistles, blows raspberry)

39
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:31,114
I don't want your blood
on my hands,

40
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:34,117
and I mean that literally,
because it would be my job to...

41
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,169
to hose down the rocks.

42
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:38,505
NARRATOR:
<i>Now, late the night before,</i>

43
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:41,257
<i>thanks to Marshall's</i>
<i>travel companion, Daphne,</i>

44
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,010
<i>Lily had received</i>
<i>some unsettling news.</i>

45
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,578
I'm gonna be a judge.

46
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,881
NARRATOR: <i>Screwing up their</i>
<i>whole plan to move to Italy.</i>

47
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,165
<i>She wasn't happy.</i>

48
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,800
Yes, I'm in a rotten mood.

49
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:52,218
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

50
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,787
Yes, this has
booze in it.

51
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,271
No, it's not
my first.

52
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:57,640
You want to make this brunch
a drunch?

53
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,809
You do you, I'm not gonna judge.

54
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:02,345
I'm gonna be a judge.

55
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:04,064
Judge.

56
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:08,535
Thank you, Linus.

57
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:09,953
NARRATOR:
<i>As for Marshall and Daphne,</i>

58
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,521
<i>they got caught</i>
<i>in that big storm.</i>

59
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,873
<i>Luckily, they had a place</i>
<i>to crash for the night.</i>

60
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,825
<i>My childhood home.</i>

61
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:19,245
<i>Okay, that sign</i>
<i>might not have been there.</i>

62
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:21,831
Thank you so much for letting
us stay the night, Mrs. Mosby.

63
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:22,966
Oh, it's our pleasure.

64
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,001
I'm just glad that storm has passed.
Oh.

65
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:27,354
But there's one storm
that hasn't passed,

66
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,372
isn't there, Marshall?

67
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:31,057
Hey, Clint.

68
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:33,042
CLINT: You know what I'm talking
about, don't you, Marshall?

69
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:34,394
I'm talking about the one
that's been raining

70
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:37,981
cats and dogs all over
this-this, this friendship.

71
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:39,265
This isn't a friendship.

72
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:40,767
Oh.

73
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,718
Nice.

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,488
We're reluctant
travel companions.

75
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,856
Well, little known fact
about me.

76
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,108
I'm an almost-graduate

77
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,194
of the Conflict Resolution
program over at... at Tri-C.

78
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:54,280
I even had my own practice
at Van Aken Plaza

79
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:55,565
before the manager
of the Wendy's

80
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,467
made me stop hogging the booth.

81
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,120
The point is,
I can fix this.

82
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:01,704
Oh, I don't know, Clint.

83
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:03,039

84
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,125
♪ Gonna resolve some conflicts

85
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:06,626

88
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,766
Okay, you know what?
We have to hit the road.

89
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,252
But, um, Mrs. Mosby, do you
mind if I take this mug?

90
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:17,937
I would very much like

91
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,056
to make fun of Ted
next time I see him.

92
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:21,257
Of course.

93
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,809
You know, when Ted was seven,

94
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,562
he and his best friend
took this Wild West photo

95
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:26,863
together at Geauga Lake.

96
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:28,381
I could go look for it.

97
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:29,732
We really should get going.

98
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:30,934
His best friend was a balloon.

99
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,068
What's a few more minutes?

100
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,103
Yeah, you're gonna want that.

101
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:36,573
So... what's everyone
doing this morning?

102
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:39,108
Oh, well, I kind of feel
like playing some tennis.

103
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,577
Maybe we should reserve a court.

104
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,045
Court.

105
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:46,733
Thank you, Linus.

106
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:48,751
Pancakes and eggs, Robin?

107
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,954
I guess that blouse won't be
loose and flowy for long.

108
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:52,788
Mom...

109
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,890
Keep talking, Loretta.

110
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:56,176
I've been waiting
all morning to...

111
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:57,960
ketchup.

112
00:03:57,962 --> 00:03:59,395
Oops.

113
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:03,149
You're not supposed to put
ketchup on scrambled eggs.

114
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:04,934
Right, Loretta, because

115
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:07,470
you're the queen
of scrambled eggs.

116
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:08,304
BARNEY:
Actually, that's

117
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:09,772
exactly what she is.

118
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:10,940
When Mom was

119
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:12,308
a groupie in the '70s,

120
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,745
her scrambled eggs made her the
darling of the MSG loading dock.

121
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:18,198
Lot of songs written
about those scrambled eggs.

122
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,982
ZZ Top's "She's Got Legs"?

123
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:21,701
Originally "She's Got Eggs."

124
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:22,585
Led Zeppelin?

125
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:23,920
"Scramble On."

126
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:25,205
Steve Miller?

127
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:26,623
"The Yolker."

128
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,842
If you listen to Pink Floyd's
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>

129
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:31,961
while eating her eggs,
it lines up perfectly.

130
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:35,431
While I'm sure it was
your mother's cooking skills

131
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:39,102
that made her so popular with
Zed Zed Top and their ilk,

132
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,687
I know for a fact

133
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,356
that she does not make
the best scrambled eggs.

134
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:46,693
Because my mom makes
the best scrambled eggs.

135
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:48,361
(gasps)

136
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:50,346
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, we've known</i>
<i>your Aunt Robin</i>

137
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:52,115
<i>for eight years at that point,</i>

138
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:54,284
<i>and here's what we knew</i>
<i>about her mom.</i>

139
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:55,451
My mom is terrified
of flying.

140
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:57,070
(bell dings)

141
00:04:57,072 --> 00:04:59,072
My mom got stung
by a jellyfish.

142
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:00,406
(bell dings)

143
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:01,908
My mom makes
the best scrambled eggs.

144
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,042
(bell dings)

145
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:05,228
NARRATOR:
<i>And... that's everything.</i>

146
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,463
In fact, she should be here
any minute.

147
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:08,631
Barney,

148
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,533
maybe she can cook you
some real scrambled eggs

149
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:12,368
so you can see what
you've been missing.

150
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,554
Don't do this, Robin.
You can't win the egg war.

151
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,389
Canadian scrambled eggs,
how quaint.

152
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,541
Does your mom put maple syrup
on them?

153
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,543
Ha, ha, ha,
this is all very friendly.

154
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:21,877
(whispering):
Get out of this now.

155
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,647
Why not? We put maple syrup
on everything else.

156
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:27,400
BARNEY:
Aw.

157
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:29,769
That's it!

158
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,021
We need your omelet station.

159
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:35,525
My son's fiancée is
about to get served...

160
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,744
some delicious
scrambled eggs.

161
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:41,030
Or I could go out to the
driveway and eat some gravel.

162
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:42,165
(soft grunt)

163
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,534
Wait. Sorry.
Did you say gravel or gavel?

164
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:45,868
Gravel. Why would
I say gavel?

165
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,203
Gavel.

166
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:51,124
(sighs)

167
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,258
Thank you, Linus.

168
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,127
Curtis, can I please

169
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,296
have a map to the lighthouse?

170
00:05:56,298 --> 00:05:58,214
It's a very romantic lighthouse.

171
00:05:58,216 --> 00:05:59,415
I can't even have a map?

172
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,551
It's a very romantic map.

173
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:03,386
I can't let you go
without a date.

174
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:04,804
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

175
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:07,307
What happened to that girl Cassie?
Cassie?

176
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:09,058
NARRATOR:
<i>Cassie was the girl I'd spent</i>

177
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,926
<i>the entire previous night</i>
<i>consoling.</i>

178
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:14,147
<i>Just consoling.</i>

179
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,064
Yeah, that's not happening.

180
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,116
NARRATOR:
<i>And then, in her anger,</i>

181
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:18,934
<i>Lily gave me a piece of advice</i>

182
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,453
<i>about which</i>
<i>she would later say...</i>

183
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:23,656
Oh, mama, that was
some bad advice.

184
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:25,458
Okay, here's why
you're an idiot.

185
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,660
Did you find
Cassie attractive?

186
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:30,946
I guess. 
Is she a relatively normal height?

187
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:33,949
Yeah.
So end up with her already.

188
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,918
God, do you really think

189
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,953
that you're gonna find
some perfect girl

190
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:41,224
who checks off every
item on your list?

191
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,642
Well, not every item.

192
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:45,011
I mean, she doesn't have
to share my love for coins.

193
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,397
Although it would
be nice, just once,

194
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,800
not to have to go stag
to Coin-Con.

195
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:53,236
Pull your head out
of your ass, Mosby.

196
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:56,138
Do you think Marshall
always makes me happy?

197
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,409
I mean, sometimes being
with him is a real trial.

198
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:01,444
Real trial.

199
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:02,462
Huh.

200
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,247
Did it to myself that time.

201
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,817
Look, Ted, it's
time to settle.

202
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,952
Take this normal-sized chick
up to the lighthouse

203
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:11,337
and fall in love with her

204
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,041
and quit bothering us with
your dumb love life stuff.

205
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:18,327
God, I am so sick of being
smarter than everyone else.

206
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:20,797
You're slipping, Linus.

207
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,299
We're running
out of glasses.

208
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:32,058
Do you want to just go
to the stupid lighthouse?

209
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,110
Ooh, zitch dog.

210
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:35,728
Cocker spaniel in the Jetta.

211
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,947
That's Marshall
Eriksen-- 28,

212
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:39,014
Daphne-- zero.

213
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:40,817
For the 28th time,

214
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,036
I'm not playing
your stupid game!

215
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,454
Oh, stupid, huh?

216
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:45,521
That's great.

217
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,540
I guess Daphne gets
to pick the music

218
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:50,025
and crap all over
my fun road-trip games.

219
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:52,295
(sighs) You know, maybe
Clint was right.

220
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,464
Maybe we do need
conflict resolution.

221
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:55,665
I knew you guys
would come around.

222
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:58,668
(Daphne and Marshall screaming)

223
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:01,941
NARRATOR: <i>And so I made up my mind</i>
<i>to settle for Cassie.</i>

224
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:04,997
So, um, what kind
of music do you like?

225
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:07,866
Hmm... nothing.

226
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,721
NARRATOR:
<i>Still, I felt optimistic.</i>

227
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,806
<i>After all,</i>
<i>Cassie was cute and single</i>

228
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:16,309
<i>and heck, it's not like</i>
<i>the universe was telling us</i>

229
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,710
<i>we shouldn't be together.</i>

230
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,318
Here we are. Enjoy.

231
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,719
Remember: happy wife,
happy life.

232
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,020
Pretend
they're just okay.

233
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:31,273
Please, Lily,
I think I can manage to...

234
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,160
Oh, my God.

235
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,361
I'm eight years
old again,

236
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:36,712
and life is perfect,

237
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:39,148
and I haven't peed my shorts
in front of 350 Webelos

238
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,884
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

239
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,052
I'm sorry, Robin.

240
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:44,387
What do you think, Lily?

241
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:47,039
Oh, my God,
they are so delicious.

242
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,408
Even more delicious than
finding out Barney peed himself

243
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,294
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

244
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:53,846
I'm sorry, Robin.

245
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:54,764
Mmm.
Come on,

246
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:55,848
they can't be
that good.

247
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,633
Oh!

248
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,552
Excuse me, Mrs. Stinson,
some of our guests

249
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:01,253
smelled your scrambled eggs
and were wondering

250
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:03,522
if you could make some
for them as well.

251
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,090
(laughing):
Oh, I don't think I should...

252
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:08,361
CROWD (chanting): Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!

253
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:09,812
Eggs! Eggs!
(sighs)

254
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,280
Clint, what are
you doing here?

255
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:14,066
What the Ohio State Board of
Holistic Medicine has repeatedly

256
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:17,286
told me I'm in no way qualified
to do: my job.

257
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:20,439
When I see a conflict
needs resolving, I must act.

258
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:22,375
Plus, Ted's mom wanted me out
of the house.

259
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,710
So, today, we're gonna build
a new paradigm

260
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:26,245
of understanding,

261
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:29,048
and then you're gonna swoop me
on back to Shaker Heights.

262
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,082
Oh, I need to stop

263
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:31,550
at Record Rev on Coventry.

264
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:32,835
My vaporizer's ready.

265
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,503
Marshall, pull over
and dump this hippie

266
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:35,921
on the side of the road.

267
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:37,122
I can't do that.

268
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:38,891
CLINT: ♪ Gonna resolve
some conflicts ♪

269
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:40,559
♪ Gonna resolve some conflicts

270
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,960
Daphne picks the music.

271
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:43,295

272
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:45,014

Oh, come on.

274
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,735
Ow! Stupid racecar!

275
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:51,904
This is why children
should not have toys!

276
00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:53,906
Look, maybe this lighthouse
thing isn't such a good idea.

277
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:55,074
No, you don't.

278
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:56,809
You committed,

279
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,944
and so did I, so let's go.

280
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:01,914
Oh. Ow! Oh!

281
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,783
Actually, it's feeling better.
(laughs)

282
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:05,284
Ow! Oh! No, it's not.

283
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:07,286
Oh. (whimpering)

284
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:09,088
Mom, I don't know
why your phone is off.

285
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,290
Maybe you left your charger
in the pickup truck.

286
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:12,541
(bell dings)

287
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:14,343
But I need you to get here
as fast  possible.

288
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:15,428
I know
you're probably gonna want

289
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,829
to take a hot bath
when you get in.

290
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:17,546
(bell dings)

291
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:18,764
She fits in a bathtub.

292
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,683
That's good news. Unless...

293
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:22,701
Oh, God, how big are
Canadian bathtubs?

294
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:24,854
(bell dings)
LORETTA: People ever line up

295
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:26,105
like this for your mom's eggs?

296
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:30,192
Loretta, even <i>I</i> could make
better eggs than this.

297
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:31,944
Oh, I'd love it
if you'd come teach me

298
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:33,145
how to make scrambled eggs.

299
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:34,947
It's a scramble-off,
everybody!

300
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:37,032
A scramble-off
to the death!

301
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,318
Someone go watch
for the cops!

302
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,403
Maybe we should have read up
on this town

303
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:43,539
before booking our wedding.

304
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,459
Let's do some,
"When you... I feel."

305
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:47,860
All right, for example,

306
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:51,163
when you don't
do trust falls,

307
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:55,217
I feel like you
should do trust falls.

308
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,837
So just do the
damn trust falls.

309
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,871
I'm driving a car, Clint.

310
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:00,306
Okay,

311
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:03,175
uh, Daphne, when you say
"Drill, baby, drill"

312
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:06,061
every time
that we pass a gas station,

313
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:08,013
I feel invalidated.

314
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,516
Marshall, when you talk,
I feel shut up!

315
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:12,384
That's very good, both of you.

316
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:14,236
Really? Both of us?

317
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,438
Name one energy
that's better than oil.

318
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,990
Wind, solar, hydroelectric.

319
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:19,575
You see what I've been dealing
with, Clint?

320
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:21,861
♪ The sticky petroleum
clings... ♪

321
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:23,028
Please not now, Clint.

322
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,731
♪ To the pelican's
broken wings ♪

323
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:29,668
♪ Hey, Mr. Oilman,
what have you done... ♪

324
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,570
Stop, stop, stop, please.
Enough! Clint,

325
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:33,372
(Marvin crying) I'm tired of your beard
and I'm tired

326
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:35,541
of this stupid therapy session.
And I'm tired

327
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:39,077
of the way that your songs have
a-a laxative effect on Marvin!

328
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,079
And on me. Every time
Clint starts singing,

329
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,848
I just got to go.
Yeah.

330
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,752
It's like, uh, the only
trust fall when you sing

331
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:50,723
is that I "trust"
that a piece of poop

332
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:54,276
is gonna "fall" out
of my son's butt.

333
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,778
(laughs)

334
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,063
Hey, Clint, how about that?

335
00:11:58,065 --> 00:11:59,732
You got us to agree on something.
Yeah.

336
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:02,651
We both think you're a loser.
(laughs)

337
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,770
This therapy works.

338
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:06,155
No!

339
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:08,123
That is not the way
therapy works at all!

340
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,108
Do you think this is
some kind of a joke?!

341
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,744
This is my career!

342
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:14,663
I will not go back to
coaching the Browns!

343
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:15,664
Why can't people take

344
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,082
what I do seriously?!

345
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:20,085
God!
(grunting)

346
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,454
(Marvin crying)

347
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,723
(strained):
Oh, my God. One more.

348
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:27,893
Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God.

349
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:30,312
(panting)

350
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:33,649
God, that was a lot of stairs.
I'm exhausted.

351
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:35,634
My chest is on fire.

352
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:36,986
Oh.

353
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:41,073
Ooh! So, Mr. Arch-itect,

354
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:42,825
what do we do now?

355
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:45,411
Fall in love or something?

356
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:47,496
NARRATOR: <i>And, kids, as I stood</i>
<i>on that lighthouse</i>

357
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:50,816
<i>and looked at that girl, I felt</i>
<i>something happen inside me,</i>

358
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:53,335
<i>something that had only</i>
<i>happened one other time</i>

359
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,254
<i>in my entire adult life.</i>

360
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:57,339
(retches)

361
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,041
ROBIN:
<i>Okay, scrambled eggs.</i>

362
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:00,843
Here we go.

363
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:03,145
Where is the egg opener?

364
00:13:04,514 --> 00:13:07,332
Never mind. I'll pre-scramble
them. It's fine.

365
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:11,003
Okay, fine, Loretta.
You know what? You win.

366
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:11,837
I don't
know how

367
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,006
to cook egg.

368
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:15,941
If you don't even know how
to make scrambled eggs,

369
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:17,342
I just worry what
kind of breakfast

370
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,979
you're gonna be serving
my grandchildren.

371
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:21,780
Well, lucky you

372
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:25,234
because that is one thing you
won't ever have to worry about.

373
00:13:33,243 --> 00:13:36,462
Mom, Robin
can't have kids.

374
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:42,888
Every single job I take on,
it's always the same!

375
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,473
"The coffee maker has to stay
in the office, Clint!"

376
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:49,477
"You still have to wear pants
on Casual Friday, Clint!"

377
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,311
"We didn't

378
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:51,562
hire you, Clint!"

379
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,963
Well, God,
I'm-I'm...

380
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,465
I'm just sick of it. I'm si...

381
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,801
Ow. Ow. Oh, I can hear
my blood right now.

382
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,937
I'm having an attack.
I'm having a blood attack.

383
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,105
A blood attack?

384
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,440
Yeah. Pull over. I need...
I-I need to meditate.

385
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,243
I got to get my heart rate down.
I'll... Ow! Pull over.

386
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,411
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Pull over!

387
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,281
Zitch dog, Labradoodle
in a Ford Fusion! Ow!

388
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,782
God...

389
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,918
Robin can't have kids?

390
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,620
But you always wanted children.

391
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,555
No, I always <i>liked</i> children.

392
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,225
I've always <i>wanted</i> a Lamborghini
where there's a hot tub inside.

393
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,377
God, I wish that existed.

394
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,263
So no grandkids.

395
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:27,431
How long have you known
about this?

396
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,467
I found out last fall.

397
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,636
<i>Robin and I had been</i>
<i>hanging out downtown</i>

398
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,322
<i>at this very cool secret bar.</i>

399
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:37,608
(dance music playing)
What a lovely place!

400
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,727
Have you ever had
sushi that fresh?

401
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:42,446
Okay, I am never getting
on a mechanical bull again.

402
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,614
(chuckles)

403
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,534
I can't believe Marshall
and Lily missed out.

404
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:49,070
Promise me,
if you ever have kids,

405
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:51,038
you'll sometimes get
a babysitter

406
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,856
and come have an epic night.

407
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:56,494
Oh, and, P.S., bring the
babysitter, she sounds dirty.

408
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,529
Actually, I, uh,
I can't have kids,

409
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,081
so that's not an issue.

410
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,533
Really?

411
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,867
Yeah.

412
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:15,146
Is it weird
that I'm hugging you like this?

413
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,400
No, it's not weird.

414
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:26,223
Now it's weird. Mm-hmm.
Yep, the rain makes it weird.

415
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,610
Mom, I'm not marrying
some future possibility

416
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:31,228
of starting a family.

417
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,497
I'm marrying a girl.

418
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,168
Who means more to me than kids.

419
00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:39,420
Or my career.

420
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:42,290
Or even the Lambor-cuzzi,
patent pending.

421
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:45,509
So please...

422
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,628
...be nice to her?

423
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,667
DAPHNE:
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

424
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:54,201
Get out there
and drag Clint's

425
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,305
downward-facing ass back in here
so we can get going.

426
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:59,890
Just let him do his thing.

427
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,025
(sighs)

428
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,927
Do you know why
the Daphnes of the world

429
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,529
always get to pick the music

430
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,815
and the Marshalls pay
all the tolls?

431
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:08,816
Because
the Marshalls

432
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:10,618
are so concerned

433
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,703
with letting everybody
do their thing,

434
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,939
and the Daphnes
are taking care of Daphne.

435
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,710
You can talk to me about solar
or wind or hydro-whatever,

436
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,446
but the world is always gonna
push you around, Marshall.

437
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,049
Until you learn
to go nuclear.

438
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:28,386
(tribal drums playing)

439
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,304
(starts engine)

440
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:31,946
What are you doing?
(tribal drums playing)

441
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,843
Is this real?

442
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:37,228
Are you doing this?

443
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:39,847
We need some driving music.

444
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:40,349
No!

445
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:44,968
(sucks air through teeth)

446
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,072
You threw a live grenade
into my marriage.

447
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,659
You screwed up my whole world.

448
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:54,745
So from now on...

449
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,648
we listen to my music.

450
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,152
♪ But I would walk 500 miles

451
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,488
♪ And I would walk 500 more...

452
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,257
I hate this song.

453
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,708
Give it time.

454
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,347
Zitch dog, beagle
in a Beetle.

455
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,883
Don't let Loretta
get to you.

456
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:19,186
Hey, when your mom gets here,
do you want to all go--

457
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:22,857
I don't know--
avoid jellyfish?

458
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,724
She's not coming.

459
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:25,276
What?

460
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,977
I finally got a hold of her.

461
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,012
She, um, never got on the plane.

462
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,564
She was too scared.

463
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,150
She won't be
at her daughter's wedding.

464
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,351
(bell dings)

465
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,291
("Try a Little Tenderness"
by Otis Redding playing)

466
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,460
If that is the case...

467
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,913
can we tell Barney
she's super fat?

468
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:48,082
It would mean the world to me.

469
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,250
(chuckles)

470
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:50,801
Of course.

471
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,220
Oh, here we go.

472
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,588
Listen, Robin...
Loretta,

473
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,040
not now. Robin just found out

474
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,709
her mom's not coming
to the wedding.

475
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:03,881
Oh.

476
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,783
Well, uh, okay.

477
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,001
Loretta...

478
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,269
My name's Mom.

479
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:10,387
Don't you ever call me
anything else.

480
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,605
I'm Mom.

481
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,891
Okay.

482
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,092
Mom.

483
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,328
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I get...

484
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,498
...carried away.

485
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:27,121
Your eggs are great, by the way.

486
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,739
LILY:
<i>Oh, mama,</i>

487
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,508
that was some bad advice.

488
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,759
Thanks, Lil.

489
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:33,243
But you know what sucks?

490
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,462
When I was
at the top

491
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:35,629
of that lighthouse,

492
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,431
despite everything else...

493
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:40,384
Wow. It's like traveling
back in time.

494
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,520
Just stop talking.

495
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,854
(sighs)

496
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,306
<i>...it was breathtaking.</i>

497
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:47,591
And I wasted it.

498
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,610
I mean, how many places
have I ruined forever

499
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:51,529
by being there
with the wrong girl?

500
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,898
So come back
with the right girl.

501
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,783
I don't know.

502
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:58,068
I'm starting to think a person
gets a certain allotment

503
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,771
of lighthouses per lifetime.

504
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,040
And I've used all mine up.

505
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,876
NARRATOR: <i>And that, kids, is the kind</i>
<i>of stupid thing you say</i>

<i>who hits the reset button</i>

507

508
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,082

509
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,218
<i>that you ever considered</i>

511
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:20,290
Look at that.

512
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:27,014
It's like traveling
back in time.

513
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:30,017
That is exactly what I said.
(chuckles)

514
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:32,636
Why couldn't it have been you
here with me two years ago?

515
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,905
That's probably
for the best.

516
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,857
When you vomit, I vomit.

517
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,308
You know that.

518
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,696
(chuckles) Well, thanks for being
here with me now.

519
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,481
Thanks for bringing me.

520
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,820
Wow.

521
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,657
It is just
bonkers beautiful here.

522
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,494
I don't know how you could
improve on a day like this.

523
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,435
Well, I'm gonna try.

524
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,560
