1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,800


2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,000
Just tell me what happened from the beginning.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,760
We had been to a bar,

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,480
nice place, and, I got chatting with one of the waitresses,

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,960
and Karen weren't happy with that, so...when we get back to the hotel,

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,120
we end up having a bit of a ding-dong.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,480
She's always getting at me, saying I weren't a real man.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,920
Wasn't a real man.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,320
- What? - It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,040
Go on.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,320
Well...then I don't know how it happened,

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,720
but suddenly there's a knife in my hands...

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,280
..and me old man was a butcher, so I know how to handle knives.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,880
- He learned us how to cut up a beast. - Taught.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,080
- What? - Taught you how to cut up a beast.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,280
Yeah, well, then I done it.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,640
- Did it. - Did it! Stabbed her,

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
over and over and over, and I looked down, and she weren't...

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,720
..wasn't...

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
..moving no more.

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,480
Any more.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,560
God help me, I dunno how it happened,

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,680
but it was an accident, I swear.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,320
You've got to help me, Mr Holmes!

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Everyone says you're the best.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,720
Without you...

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,240
I'll get hung for this.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,440
No, no, Mr Bewick, not at all.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,840
Hanged, yes.

30
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,860
What the hell are you doing?!

31
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,300
- Bored. - What?!

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,220
- Bored! - No...

33
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,940
Bored!

34
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,900
Bored!

35
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,180
Don't know what's got into the criminal classes.

36
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,500
- Good job I'm not one of them. - So you take it out on the wall?

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,300
The wall had it coming.

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,820
What about that Russian case?

39
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,620
Belarus? Open and shut domestic murder. Not worth my time.

40
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,380
Oh, shame!

41
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,940
Anything in? I'm starving.

42
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,780
Oh, f...

43
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,980
There's a head.

44
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,380
- A severed head! - Just tea for me, thanks.

45
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,220
- No, there's a head in the fridge. - Yes?

46
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,060
A bloody head!

47
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,300
Well, where else could I put it? You don't mind, do you?

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,860
- Well...  - Got it from Barts morgue.

49
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,980
I'm measuring the coagulation of saliva after death.

50
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,100
I see you've written up the taxi driver case.

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,580
Er...yes.

52
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,620
A Study In Pink.

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,820
Nice.

54
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,300
Well, you know. Pink lady, pink case,

55
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,620
pink phone. There was a lot of pink. Did you like it?

56
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,460
- Um...no. - Why not? I thought you'd be flattered.

57
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,780
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through everything and everyone in seconds.

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,780
"What's incredible, though, is how spectacularly ignorant he is

59
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,700
- "about some things." - Hang on, I didn't mean that...

60
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,620
Oh, you meant "spectacularly ignorant" in a nice way

61
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,860
Look, it doesn't matter to me who's Prime Minister or...

62
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,100
- I know... - Who's sleeping with who...

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,220
- Whether the Earth goes round the sun. - That again! It's not important!

64
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,780
Not impor...?!

65
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,280
It's primary school stuff. How can you not know that?

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,780
Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it.

67
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,700
Deleted it?

68
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,740
Listen. This is my hard drive, and it only makes sense

69
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,940
to put things in there that are useful. REALLY useful.

70
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,460
Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish.

71
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,460
That makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters. Do you see?

72
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,980
But it's the solar system!

73
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,300
Oh, hell! What does that matter?!

74
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,620
So we go round the sun. If we went round the moon,

75
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,500
or round and round the garden like a teddy bear,

76
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,380
it wouldn't make any difference!

77
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,100
All that matters to me is the work! Without that, my brain rots!

78
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,280
Put that in your blog!

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,460
Or, better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world!

80
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,820
- Where are you going? - Out! I need some air.

81
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,580
- Oh, sorry, love! - Sorry.

82
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,940
Have you two had a little domestic?

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there.

84
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,700
He should have wrapped himself up a bit more.

85
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,860
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,660
Quiet.

87
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,500
Calm. Peaceful.

88
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,180
Isn't it hateful?

89
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,300
Oh, I'm sure something will turn up, Sherlock.

90
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,220
A nice murder. That'll cheer you up.

91
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,100
Can't come too soon.

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,820
Hey, what have you done to my bloody wall?!

93
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,780
I'm putting this on your rent, young man!

94
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,360
- Morning. - Oh...m-morning.

95
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,460
See? Told you you should have gone with the Lilo.

96
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,220
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine. It's very kind of you.

97
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,140
Well, maybe next time I'll let you kip at the end of my bed, you know.

98
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:59,900
'..which was discovered mouldering...18 months ago. Experts are hailing it as the artistic find of the century... ..It fetched over 20 million pounds.This one is anticipated to do even better.

99
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,900
- What about the time after that? - '...

100
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,300
- Do you want some breakfast? - Love some.

101
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,380
Well, make it yourself. I'm going to have a shower.

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:18,700
 Back now to our main story.There's been a massive explosion in central London.As yet, there are no reports of any casualties,and the police are unable to say if there's any suspicion of terrorist involvement. 'Police have issued an emergency number for friends and relatives.'

103
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,660


104
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,700
Sarah!

105
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,980
Sorry! I've got to run!

106
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,980
Excuse me, can I get through?

107
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,020
I live over there.

108
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,180
Sherlock!

109
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,340
Sherlock!

110
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,380
John.

111
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,700
I saw it on the telly. Are you OK?

112
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,020
Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.

113
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,940
Gas leak, apparently.

114
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,500
- I can't. - Can't?

115
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,060
Stuff I've got on is just too big. I can't spare the time.

116
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,420
Never mind your usual trivia. This is of national importance.

117
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,980
How's the diet?

118
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,860
Fine.

119
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,620
Perhaps you can get through to him, John.

120
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,660
- What? - I'm afraid my brother can be very intransigent.

121
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,060
If you're so keen, why don't you investigate it?

122
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,920
No. I can't possibly be away from the office for any length of time.

123
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,780
Not with the Korean elections so...

124
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,100
Well, you don't need to know about that, do you?

125
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,020
Besides, a case like this, it requires...legwork.

126
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,460
How's Sarah, John? How was the Lilo?

127
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,580
Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.

128
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,740
- Oh, yes, of course. - How...? Oh, never mind.

129
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,060
Sherlock's business seems to be booming since you and he became...

130
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,700
pals. What's he like to live with?

131
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,380
- Hellish, I imagine. - I'm never bored.

132
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,340
Good. That's good, isn't it?

133
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,300
Andrew West, known as Westie to his friends. Civil servant.

134
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,380
Found dead on the tracks at Battersea station this morning

135
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,020
with his head smashed in.

136
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,820
Jumped in front of a train?

137
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,620
Seems the logical assumption.

138
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,420
- But? - But?

139
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,140
Well, you wouldn't be here if it was just an accident.

140
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
Hah!

141
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,440
The MoD is working on a new missile defence system,

142
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,740
the Bruce-Partington Program it's called.

143
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,180
The plans for it were on a memory stick.

144
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,100
That wasn't very clever.

145
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,660
It's not the only copy. Oh. But it is secret.

146
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,860
And missing.

147
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,220
Top secret?

148
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,700
Very. We think West must have taken the memory stick.

149
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,060
We can't risk it falling into the wrong hands.

150
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,940
You've got to find those plans, Sherlock.

151
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,060
- Don't make me order you. - I'd like to see you try.

152
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,540
Think it over.

153
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,980
Goodbye, John.

154
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,060
See you very soon.

155
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,860
Why did you lie?

156
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,580
You've got nothing on.

157
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,380
Not a single case. That's why the wall took a pounding.

158
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,620
- Why did you tell your brother you were busy? - Why shouldn't I?

159
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,260
Oh.

160
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,460
Nice.

161
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,820
Sibling rivalry. Now we're getting somewhere.

162
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,500
Sherlock Holmes.

163
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,660
Of course. How could I refuse?

164
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,940
Lestrade - I've been summoned.Coming?

165
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,620
- If you want me to. - Of course.

166
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,900
I'd be lost without my blogger.

167
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,420
You like the funny cases, don't you?

168
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,980
- The surprising ones. - Obviously.

169
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,540
You'll love this. That explosion.

170
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,700
- Gas leak, yes? - No.

171
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,260
- No? - No. Made to look like one.

172
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,700
- What? - Hardly anything left of the place, except a strongbox.

173
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,900
A VERY strong box, and inside it was this.

174
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,780
- You haven't opened it? - It's addressed to you, isn't it?

175
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,740
- We've X-rayed it. It's not booby-trapped. - How reassuring.

176
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,420


177
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,580
Nice stationery.

178
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,660
Bohemian.

179
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,180
What?

180
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,780
From the Czech Republic. No fingerprints?

181
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,420
No.

182
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,220
She used a fountain pen. Parker Duofold, iridium nib.

183
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,700
- She? - Obviously.

184
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,340
Obviously.

185
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,980
But that... That's the phone. The pink phone.

186
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,910
What, from The Study In Pink?

187
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,580
Obviously, it's not the same phone, but it's supposed to look like...

188
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,180
"Study In Pink"? You read his blog?

189
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,860
Of course I read his blog. We all do.

190
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,660
Do you REALLY not know that the Earth goes round the sun?

191
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,220
It isn't the same phone. This one's brand-new.

192
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,700
Someone's taken trouble to make it look the same,

193
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,180
which means your blog has a far wider readership.

194
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,100
'You have one new message.'

195
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,980
- Was that it? - No, that's not it.

196
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,740
What the hell are we supposed to make of that?

197
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,660
An estate agent's photo and the bloody Greenwich pips.

198
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,260
- It's a warning. - A warning?

199
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,900
Some secret societies used to send dried melon seeds,

200
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,220
orange pips, things like that - five pips.

201
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,420
They're warning us it's going to happen again.

202
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,860
- I've seen this place before. - Hang on.

203
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,980
- What's going to happen again? - Boom!

204
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,620
Mrs Hudson!

205
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,960
You had a look, didn't you,

206
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,300
when you first came to see about your flat?

207
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,980
The door's been opened, recently.

208
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,860
No, can't be. That's the only key.

209
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,620
I can't get anyone interested in this flat.

210
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,460
It's the damp, I expect - that's the curse of basements.

211
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,870
I'd a place once when I was first married.

212
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,260
Mould all up the wall...

213
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,060
Oh. Dear me.

214
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,060
Shoes.

215
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,060
He's a bomber, remember.

216
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,100


217
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,740
Hello.

218
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,060
Hello...sexy.

219
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,420
Who's this?

220
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,460
I've...sent you...a little puzzle,

221
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,260
just to say hi.

222
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,380
Who's talking? Why are you crying?

223
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,980
I...I'm not crying.

224
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,700
I'm typing.

225
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,900
And this...stupid bitch

226
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,100
is reading it out.

227
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,580
The curtain rises.

228
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,980
- What? - Nothing.

229
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,380
No, what did you mean?

230
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,220
I've been expecting this for some time.

231
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:06,060
12 hours to solve...my puzzle, Sherlock...

232
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,980
or I'm going to be...

233
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,900
..so...naughty.

234
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,260


235
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,740
So, who do you suppose it was?

236
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,380
Woman on the phone - the crying woman.

237
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,660
Oh, she doesn't matter, she's just a hostage. No lead there.

238
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,200
I wasn't thinking about leads.

239
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,220
You're not going to be much use to her.

240
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,100


241
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,060


242
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,140


243
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:04,980


244
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,180
Are they trying to trace it - trace the call?

245
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,780
Bomber's too smart for that. Pass my phone.

246
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,460
- Where is it? - Jacket.

247
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,060
Careful!

248
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,860
Text from your brother.

249
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,980
- Delete it. - Delete it?

250
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,540
Plans are out of the country. Nothing we can do.

251
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,100


252
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,850
Mycroft thinks there is. He's texted you eight times. Must be important.

253
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,140
Then why didn't he cancel his dental appointment?

254
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,540
- His what? - Mycroft never texts if he can talk.

255
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,430
Andrew West stole the missile plans,

256
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,740
tried to sell them, got his head smashed in,

257
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,820
end of story.

258
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,850
The only mystery is why my brother is so determined to bore me

259
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,900
when somebody else is being so delightfully interesting.

260
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
Try and remember there's a woman who might die.

261
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,020
What for? There's hospitals full of people dying, Doctor.

262
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,290
Why don't you go and cry by their bedside

263
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,290
and see what good it does them?

264
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,560


265
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,020
- Any luck? - Oh, yes!

266
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:13,220
- Oh, sorry. I didn't... - Jim, hi! Come in! Come in!

267
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,740
Jim, this is Sherlock Holmes.

268
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,500
- And, er... Sorry. - John Watson.

269
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,580
So you're Sherlock Holmes.

270
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,500
Molly's told me all about you. You on one of your cases?

271
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,380
Jim works in IT, upstairs.

272
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,460
That's how we met. Office romance.

273
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,540
Gay.

274
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,940
- Sorry, what? - Nothing. Um, hey.

275
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,260
Sorry. Sorry!

276
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,700
Well, I'd better be off.

277
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,420
I'll see you at the Fox.

278
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,020
- About sixish? - Yeah.

279
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,380
Bye.

280
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,620
It was nice to meet you.

281
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,940
You too.

282
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,860
What do you mean, gay? We're together.

283
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,350
Domestic bliss must suit you, Molly.

284
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,740
You've put on 3 pounds since I last saw you.

285
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,500
- Two-and-a-half. - No, three.

286
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,380
- Sherlock. - He's not gay!

287
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,000
Why do you have to spoil...?

288
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,220
- He's not! - With that level of grooming?

289
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,380
Because he puts product in his hair? I put product in my hair.

290
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,900
You wash your hair, there's a difference.

291
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,340
Tinted eyelashes, signs of taurine cream around the frown lines,

292
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
those tired, clubber's eyes.

293
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,220
- Then there's his underwear. - His underwear?

294
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,180
Visible above the waistline. Very visible, particular brand.

295
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,140
Plus the suggestive fact that he just left his number under this dish.

296
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,340
I'd say you'd better break it off now and save yourself the pain.

297
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,060
Charming, well done

298
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,460
Just saving her time. Isn't that kinder?

299
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,580
Kinder? No, no, Sherlock, that wasn't kind.

300
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,620
Go on, then.

301
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,220
You know what I do. Off you go.

302
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,700
- Oh... No. - Go on.

303
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,440
I don't want stand here so you can humiliate me while I...

304
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,320
An outside eye, a second opinion

305
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,460
it's very useful to me. Really!

306
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,780
Fine.

307
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,180
- Oh, they're just a pair of sh... trainers. - Good.

308
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,940
They're in good nick. I'd say they were pretty new,

309
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,150
except the sole has been well worn,

310
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,940
so the owner must have had them for a while.

311
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,020
Er, very '80s. Probably one of those retro designs.

312
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,340
You're on sparkling form. What else?

313
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,300
They're quite big. So a man's.

314
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,780
But...

315
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,540
But there's traces of a name inside in felt-tip.

316
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,330
Adults don't write their names inside their shoes,

317
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,780
so these belong to a kid.

318
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,060
Excellent. What else?

319
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,740
- That's it. - That's it.

320
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,340
- How did I do? - Well, John.

321
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Really well.

322
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,380
I mean, you missed almost everything of importance, but, you know...

323
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,000
The owner loved these. Scrubbed them clean.Whitened them

324
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,500
Changed the laces three...no, four times.

325
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,680
There are traces of flaky skin

326
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,900
where his fingers have come into contact with them, so he had eczema.

327
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,380
The shoes are more worn on the inner side, so he had weak arches.

328
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,940
British-made, 20 years old.

329
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,940
- 20 years? - They're not retro, they're original.

330
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,140
Limited edition - two blue stripes, 1989.

331
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,860
There's still mud on them. They look new.

332
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,740
Someone's kept them that way.

333
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,820
Quite a bit of mud caked on the soles.

334
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,940
Analysis shows it's from Sussex with London mud overlaying it.

335
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,300
- How do you know? - Pollen.

336
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:46,660


337
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,860
Clear as a map reference. South of the river.

338
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,370
This kid came to London from Sussex 20 years ago

339
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,940
- and left the trainers behind. - What happened to him?

340
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,580
Something bad.

341
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,660
He loved those shoes, remember. He'd never leave them filthy.

342
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
Wouldn't let them go unless he had to.

343
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,460
So, a child with big feet gets...

344
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,860
What?

345
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,940
Carl Powers.

346
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,100
- Sorry, who? - Carl Powers, John.

347
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,740
What is it?

348
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,420
It's where I began.

349
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,530
1989, kid, champion swimmer, came from

350
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,860
Brighton for a school sports tournament, drowned in the pool.

351
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,440
Tragic accident. You wouldn't remember it, whould you?

352
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,020
But you remember.

353
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,740
- Yes. - Something fishy about it?

354
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,420
Nobody thought so.

355
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,170
Nobody except me. I was only a kid myself.

356
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,140
I read about it in the papers.

357
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,230
You started young, didn't you?

358
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,660
The boy, Carl Powers,

359
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,580
had some kind of fit in the water,

360
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,020
but by the time they got him out, it was too late.

361
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,810
There was something wrong somewhere.

362
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,460
- I couldn't get it out of my head. - What?

363
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,410
- His shoes.  - What about them?

364
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,420
They weren't there. I made a fuss.

365
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,550
I tried to get the police interested,

366
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,100
but nobody seemed to think it was important.

367
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,700
He'd left all the rest of his clothes in his locker,

368
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,460
but there was no sign of his shoes.

369
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,100
Until now.

370
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,340
Can I help?

371
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,740
I want to help. There's only five hours left.

372
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:54,590


373
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,580
It's your brother.

374
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,260
He's texting me now.

375
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,960
How does he know my number?

376
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,660
Must be a root canal.

377
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,540
Look, he did say...national importance.

378
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,900
- How quaint!  - What is?

379
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,860
You are. Queen and country.

380
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,700
- You can't just ignore it.  - I'm not ignoring it.

381
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,340
Putting my best man onto it right now.

382
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,380
Right, good!

383
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,980
Who's that?

384
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,860
John, how nice!

385
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,740
I was hoping it wouldn't be long. How can I help you?

386
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,380
Thank you.

387
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,140
Um, I was wanting to...

388
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,380
Your brother sent me to collect more facts

389
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,140
about the stolen plans - the missile plans.

390
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,780
- Did he?  - Yes. He's investigating now.

391
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,020
He's, er...investigating away.

392
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,860
I just wondered what else you could tell me about the dead man.

393
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,940
Er, 27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.

394
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,260
MI6.

395
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,490
He was involved in the

396
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,020
Bruce-Partington Program in a minor capacity.

397
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,490
Security checks A-OK.

398
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,740
No known terrorist affiliations or sympathies.

399
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,500
Last seen by his fiancee 10:30 yesterday evening.

400
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,260
Lucy, love, I've got to go out.

401
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,300
I've got to see someone.

402
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,060
Westie!

403
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,340
He was found at Battersea, yes. So he got on the train?

404
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,780
- No.  - What?

405
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,220
He had an Oyster card...

406
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,220


407
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,250
..But it hadn't been used.

408
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,660
He must have bought a ticket.

409
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,180
Hm. There was no ticket on the body.

410
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,740
Then... How did he end up with

411
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,100
a bashed-in brain on the tracks at Battersea?

412
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,540
That is the question -

413
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,140
the one I was rather hoping Sherlock would provide an answer to.

414
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,260
How's he getting on?

415
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,220
He's fine.

416
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,620
And it is going...very well.

417
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,060
He's, um... He's completely focused on it.

418
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,020
- Poison!  - What are you going on about?

419
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,900
Clostridium botulinum.

420
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,260
It's one of the deadliest poisons on the planet.

421
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,380
Carl Powers.

422
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,980
Are you saying he was murdered?

423
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,740
Remember the shoelaces?

424
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,520
He suffered from eczema.

425
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,340
 It would be easy to introduce the poison into his medication.

426
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,350
Two hours later he comes to London,

427
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,060
the poison paralyses the muscles and he drowns.

428
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,110
How come the autopsy didn't pick that up?

429
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,860
It's virtually undetectable. Nobody was looking for it.

430
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,220
There are still tiny traces of it in the trainers

431
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,460


432
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,460


433
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,460


434
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,180
from where he put the cream on his feet.

435
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,100


436
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,100


437
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,100


438
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,710
That's why they had to go.

439
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,830
So how do we let the bomber know?

440
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,140
Get his attention, stop the clock.

441
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,300
- The killer kept the shoes all these years.  - Yes.

442
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,780
Meaning... He's our bomber.

443
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,300
"Well done, you.

444
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,140
"Come and get me."

445
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,140
Where are you?

446
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
Tell us where you are.

447
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,460
She lives in Cornwall.

448
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,370
Two men broke in wearing masks,

449
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,540
forced her to drive to the car park

450
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,740
and decked her out in enough explosives to take down a house.

451
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,900
Told her to phone you.

452
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,260
Check the read-out from this - pager.

453
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,700
If she deviated by one word, the sniper would set her off.

454
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,340
- Or if you hadn't solved the case. - Oh...elegant!

455
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,180
Elegant?

456
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,060
What was the point? Why would anyone do this?

457
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,780
Oh...I can't be the only person in the world that gets bored.

458
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,020
'You have one new message.'

459
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,500
Four pips.

460
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,580
First test passed,

461
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,860
it would seem here's the second.

462
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,220
It's abandoned, wouldn't you say?

463
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,860
I'll see if it's been reported.

464
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,740
Freak, it's for you.

465
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,980
Hello.

466
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,860
'It's OK that you've gone to the police.'

467
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,500
Who is this?

468
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,340
Is this you again?

469
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,580
'But don't rely on them.

470
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,420
'Clever you,

471
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,620
'guessing about Carl Powers.

472
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,100
'I never liked him.'

473
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,380
Carl laughed at me,

474
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,460
so I stopped him laughing.

475
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,540
You've stolen another voice, I presume.

476
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,980
This is about you and me.

477
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,020
Who are you? What's that noise?

478
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
It's the sounds of life, Sherlock.

479
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,060
But don't worry. I can soon fix that.

480
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,020
You solved my last puzzle in nine hours.

481
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,180
This time you have eight.

482
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,500
Great!

483
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,420
We've found it.

484
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,880
The car was hired yesterday

485
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,780
morning by an Ian Monkford. Banker of some kind.

486
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,940
City boy. Paid in cash.

487
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,230
Told his wife he was going

488
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,180
away on a business trip, never arrived.

489
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,060
- You're still hanging round him.  - Yeah, well...

490
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,980
- Opposites attract, I s'pose.  - We're not...

491
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,060
You should get yourself a hobby. Stamps,

492
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,300
- maybe. Model trains. Safer.  - Before you ask,

493
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,860
yes, it's Monkford's blood. DNA checks out.

494
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,260
- No body.  - Not yet.

495
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,060
Get a sample sent to the lab.

496
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,300
Mrs Monkford...

497
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,100
Yes. Sorry, but I've already spoken with two policemen.

498
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,980
We're not from the police, we're...

499
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,380
Sherlock Holmes. Very old friend of your husband's.

500
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,060
We, um...

501
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,500
we grew up together.

502
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,940
I'm sorry. Who? I don't think he ever mentioned you.

503
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,140
Oh, he must have done. This is...

504
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,140
This is horrible. I mean, I just can't believe it.

505
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,060
I only saw him the other day.

506
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,580
Same old Ian. Not a care in the world.

507
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,290
Sorry... My husband has been depressed for months.

508
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,860
Who are you?

509
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,040
Really strange that he hired a car.

510
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,100
Why would he do that? It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?

511
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,380
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew the tax on the car, that's all.

512
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,860
Ah, well! That was Ian.

513
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,500
- That was Ian all over.  - No, it wasn't.

514
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,220
Wasn't it? Interesting.

515
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,100
- Who was that?  - Why did you lie to her?

516
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,160
People don't like telling you things but

517
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,770
they love to contradict you.

518
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,060
Past tense, did you notice?

519
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,260
- What?  - I referred to her husband in the past tense.

520
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,150
She joined in. Bit premature.

521
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,940
They've only just found the car.

522
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,220
You think she murdered her husband?

523
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,180
- That's not a mistake a murderer would make.  - I see...

524
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,030
No, I don't. What am I seeing?

525
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,580
Fishing.

526
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,820
- Try fishing.  - Where now?

527
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,300
Janus Cars.

528
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Just found this in the glove compartment.

529
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,900
Can't see how I can help you gentlemen.

530
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,910
Mr Monkford hired the car from you yesterday.

531
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,860
Yeah, lovely motor.

532
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,860
Mazda RX8. Wouldn't mind one of them myself.

533
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,700
Is that one?

534
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,740
No, they're all Jags.

535
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,900
I can see you're not a car man, eh?

536
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,160
But surely you can afford one - a Mazda,

537
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,580
- I mean.  - Yeah, fair point.

538
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,720
It's like working in a sweet shop. Once

539
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,030
you start eating the Liquorice Allsorts,

540
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,020
where does it stop?

541
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,540
You didn't know Mr Monkford.

542
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,500
No, he was just a client.

543
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,900
He came in here and hired one of my cars.

544
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,100
I've no idea what happened to him. Poor sod!

545
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,930
- Nice holiday, Mr. Ewart?  - Eh?

546
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,220
You've been away, haven't you?

547
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,540
Oh, the... no, it's sun beds, I'm afraid.

548
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,780
Too busy to get away.

549
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,540
My wife would love it, though - bit of sun.

550
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,730
- Have you got any change for the cigarette machine?  - What?

551
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,580
I noticed one on the way and I haven't got any change and I'm gasping.

552
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,420
No, sorry.

553
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,540
Oh, well! Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Ewart.

554
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,020
You've been very helpful. Come on, John!

555
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,920
I've got change, if you still want to...

556
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,460
Nicotine patches, remember? I'm doing well.

557
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,780
- So, what was all that about?  - I needed to look inside his wallet.

558
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,980
- Why?  - Mr. Ewart's a liar.

559
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Hello.

560
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,980
The clue's in the name - Janus Cars.

561
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,020
Why would you be giving me a clue?

562
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,260
Why does anyone do anything?

563
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,980
Because I'm bored.

564
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,700
We were made for each other, Sherlock.

565
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,020
- Then talk to me in your own voice.  - Patience.

566
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,820
How much blood was on that seat, would you say?

567
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,620
How much? About a pint.

568
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,420
Not about. Exactly a pint. That was their first mistake.

569
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,580
The blood's definitely Ian Monkford's, but it's been frozen.

570
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,140
- Frozen?  - There are clear signs.

571
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,980
I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time ago

572
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,450
and that's what they spread on the seat.

573
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,900
- Who did?  - Janus Cars. The clue's in the name.

574
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,580
- The god with two faces?  - Exactly.

575
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,380
They provide a very special service.

576
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,180
If you've got any kind of a problem - money troubles,

577
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,820
bad marriage, whatever - Janus Cars will help you disappear.

578
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,990
Ian Monkford was in some kind of trouble - financial at a guess,

579
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,580
he's a banker - couldn't see a way out.

580
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,540
But if he were to vanish,

581
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,060
if the car he hired was found with his blood on the driver's seat...

582
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,940
- So where is he?  - Colombia.

583
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,740
Colombia?!

584
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,100
Mr. Ewart, of Janus Cars,

585
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,700
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note in his wallet.

586
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,180
Quite a bit of change, too.

587
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,940
He told us he hadn't been abroad recently,

588
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,700
but when I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly.

589
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,180
No-one wears a shirt on a sun bed.

590
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,140
- That, plus his arm.  - His arm?

591
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,460
He kept scratching it. Obviously irritating him, and bleeding.

592
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,150
Why? Because he'd recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably.

593
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,500
Hard to tell at that distance.

594
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,380
He's just back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia.

595
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,500
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance, and she splits it with Janus Cars.

596
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,980
- Mrs Monkford?  - Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

597
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,700
Go and arrest them, Inspector, that's what you do best.

598
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,980
We need to let our bomber know the case is solved.

599
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,540
I am on fire!

600
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,540


601
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,460
'He says...

602
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,220
'you can come and fetch me.'

603
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,780
Help!

604
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,140
Help me, please!

605
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,420
- Feeling better?  - Mmm.

606
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,540
We've hardly stopped for breath since this thing started.

607
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,380
- Has it occurred to you...?  - Probably.

608
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,780
No, has it occurred to you that the bomber's playing a game with you?

609
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,060
The envelope, breaking into the other flat,

610
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,170
the dead kid's shoes - it's all meant for you.

611
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,420
Yes, I know.

612
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,980
Is it him, then? Moriarty?

613
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,500
Perhaps.

614
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,940
- That could be anybody.  - It could be, yeah.

615
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,720
Lucky for you, I've been more than a little unemployed.

616
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,020
- How d'you mean?  - Lucky for you,

617
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,180
Mrs Hudson and I watch far too much telly.

618
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,580
'..Thank you, Tyra! Doesn't she look lovely, everybody, now?'

619
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,620
'Anyway...speaking of silk purses...'

620
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,260
Hello?

621
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,620
'This one...

622
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,420
'is a bit...'

623
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,020
..defective.

624
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,180
'Sorry.'

625
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,500
She's blind.

626
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,060
'This is...'

627
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,340
...a funny one.

628
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,700
I'll give you...

629
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,860
...12 hours.

630
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,100
Why are you doing this?

631
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,100
I like...

632
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,780
...to watch you...

633
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,900
dance.

634
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,100
'..And I see you're back to your bad habits.'

635
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,750
'...Continuing into the sudden death

636
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,260
of the popular TV personality Connie Prince.

637
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,660
'Miss Prince, famous for her makeover programmes,

638
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,900
'was found dead two days ago by her brother in the house they shared...'

639
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,220
Connie Prince, 54. She had one of those makeover shows on the telly.

640
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,300
- Did you see it?  - No.

641
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,580
- Very popular. She was going places.  - Not any more.

642
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,900
Dead two days. According to one of her staff, Raoul de Santos,

643
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,380
she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden. Nasty wound.

644
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,060
Tetanus bacteria enters the bloodstream, good night, Vienna.

645
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,940
I suppose.

646
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,860
- Something's wrong with this picture.  - Eh?

647
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,720
Can't be that simple, otherwise the bomber

648
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,500
wouldn't be directing us towards it. Something's wrong.

649
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,980
-John?  - Mm.

650
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,340
Cut on her hand, it's deep. Would have bled a lot, right?

651
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,340
- Yeah.  - But the wound's clean.

652
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,860
Very clean, and fresh.

653
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,980
How long would the bacteria have been incubating inside her?

654
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,420
Oh, eight, ten days.

655
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,980
The cut was made later.

656
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,420
- After she was dead?  - Must have been.

657
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,400
The only question is,

658
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,540
how did the tetanus enter the dead woman's system?

659
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,460
- You want to help, right?  - Of course.

660
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,520
Connie Prince's background - family history, everything,

661
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,380
- get me data.  - Right.

662
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,300
- There's something else that we haven't thought of.  - Is there?

663
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,860
Yes. Why is he doing this - the bomber?

664
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,740
If this woman's death was suspicious, why point it up?

665
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,740
- Good Samaritan.  - Who press-gangs suicide bombers?

666
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,260
- Bad Samaritan.  - I'm...I'm serious, Sherlock.

667
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,300
Listen, I'm cutting you slack here, I'm trusting you,

668
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,740
but out there somewhere, some poor bastard's covered in Semtex

669
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,940
and he's just waiting for you to solve the puzzle, so just tell me,

670
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,540
what are we dealing with?

671
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,860
Something new.

672
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,500
Connection, connection, connection. There must be a connection.

673
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,340
Carl Powers, killed 20 years ago.

674
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,180
The bomber knew him, admitted that he knew him.

675
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,180


676
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,420
The bomber's IPhone was in the stationery from the Czech Republic.

677
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,920
The first hostage from Cornwall, the second from London,

678
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,250
the third from Yorkshire, judging by her accent.

679
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,060
What's he doing? Working his way round the world, showing off?

680
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,260
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

681
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,900
'Joining the...dots.'

682
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,700
Three hours.

683
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,180
Boom... boom.

684
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,180
- We're devastated.  - Of course we are.

685
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,660
Can I get you anything, sir?

686
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,220
Er, no. No, thanks.

687
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,740
Raoul is my rock. I don't think I could have managed.

688
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,610
We didn't always see eye to eye... but my sister was very dear to me.

689
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,820
And to the, er, public, Mr Prince.

690
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,860
Oh, she was adored.

691
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,540
I've seen her take girls who looked like the back end of Routemasters

692
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,020
and turn them into princesses.

693
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,420
Still, it's a relief, in a way,

694
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,540
to know that she's beyond this vale of tears.

695
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,260
Absolutely.

696
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,260
Great.

697
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,900
Thank you. Thanks again.

698
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,300
It's a real shame. I liked her.

699
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,580
She taught you how to do your colours.

700
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,500
- Colours?  - You know, what goes best with what.

701
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,760
I should never wear cerise, apparently. Drains me.

702
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,820
Who's that?

703
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,100
- Home Office.  - Home Office?

704
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,630
Well, Home Secretary, actually. Owes me a favour.

705
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,700
A pretty girl, but she messed about with herself too much.

706
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,080
They all do these days. People can hardly move their faces.

707
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,460
It's silly, isn't it?

708
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,260
- Did you ever see her show?  - Not until now.

709
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,180
'You look pasty, love.

710
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,220
'Ah, rained every day but one...'

711
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,460
That's the brother. No love lost there,

712
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,620
- if you can believe the papers.  - So I gather.

713
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,580
I've just had a fruitful chat with people who love this show.

714
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,660
The fan site's indispensable for gossip.

715
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,020
'..Don't you think, girls? Off, off, off, off, off, off, off!'

716
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,580
It's more common than people think.

717
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,830
The tetanus is in the soil,

718
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,980
people cut themselves on rose bushes, garden forks,

719
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,340
that sort of thing, and if left un...treated...

720
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,340
- I don't know what I'm going to do now. - Right.

721
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,860
I mean, she's left me this place... which is lovely...

722
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,980
- ...but it's not the same without her. - That's why...

723
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,520
My paper wanted to get the,

724
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,810
um...the full story straight from the horse's mouth.

725
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,100
Are you sure it's not too soon?

726
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,260
- No. - Right.

727
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,540
You fire away.

728
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,150
- John. - Hi. Look, get over here quickly.

729
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,020
I think I'm onto something.

730
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,660
You'll need to pick up some stuff first. Got a pen?

731
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,940
I'll remember.

732
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,100
- That'll be him. - What?

733
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,620
- Ah, Mr Prince, isn't it? - Yes.

734
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,820
- Very good to meet you. - Yes, thank you.

735
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,380
- So sorry to hear about... - Yes, yes, very kind.

736
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,060
Shall we, er...?

737
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,610
You were right,

738
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,780
the bacteria got into her another way.

739
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,420
- Oh, yes? - Yes.

740
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,300
- Right, are we all set? - Er, yes. Shall we, um...?

741
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,820
Not too close. I'm raw from crying.

742
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,980
Oh, who's this?

743
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,940
Sekhmet. Named after the Egyptian goddess.

744
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,140
How nice. Was she Connie's?

745
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,220
Yes, a little present from yours truly.

746
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,460
Sherlock, light ready?

747
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,980
Oh, er...

748
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,730
- 2.8. - Bloody hell!

749
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,180
- What are you playing at? - Sorry!

750
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,700
You're like Laurel and bloody Hardy, you two! What's going on?

751
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,700


752
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,870
I think we've got what we came for.

753
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,110
- Excuse us. - What?

754
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,660
- Sherlock. - What?

755
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,700
- We've got deadlines. - But you've not taken anything!

756
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,940
Yes! Ooh, yes!

757
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,860
You think it was the cat. It wasn't the cat.

758
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,660
What? Yes. Yeah, it is. It must be.

759
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,940
It's how he got the tetanus into her system.

760
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,580
- Its paws stink of disinfectant. - Lovely idea.

761
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,020
No, he coated it onto the claws of her cat.

762
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,020
It's a new pet, bound to be a bit jumpy around her.

763
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,140
A scratch is almost inevitable.

764
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,820
I thought of it when I saw the scratches on her arm,

765
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,260
but it's too random and clever for the brother.

766
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,830
He murdered his sister for her money.

767
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,180
- Did he? - Didn't he?

768
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,860
Nope. It was revenge.

769
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,260
- Rev...? Who wanted revenge? - Raoul, the houseboy.

770
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,940
Kenny Prince was the butt of his sister's jokes.

771
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,520
Virtual bullying campaign. Finally, he had enough,

772
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,060
fell out with her badly. It's all on the website.

773
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,680
She threatened to disinherit Kenny,

774
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,660
- Raoul had grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle... - Wait. Wait!

775
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,100
Wait a second. What about the disinfectant on the cat's claws?

776
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,260
Raoul keeps a very clean house.

777
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,540
You came through the kitchen door,

778
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,310
saw the state of that floor

779
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,220
scrubbed within an inch of its life.

780
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,110
You smell of disinfectant.

781
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,220
No, the cat doesn't come into it.

782
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,640
Raoul's internet records do, though.

783
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,740
I hope we can get a cab from here.

784
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,060
Raoul de Santos is your killer.

785
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,940
Kenny Prince's houseboy.

786
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,220
Second autopsy shows

787
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,340
it wasn't tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince,

788
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,580
it was botulinum toxin.

789
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,700
We've been here before.

790
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,100
Carl Powers. Tut-tut.

791
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,760
Our bomber's repeated himself.

792
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,020
So how'd he do it?

793
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,940
- Botox injection. - Botox?

794
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,500
Botox is a diluted form of botulinum. Among other things,

795
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,030
Raoul de Santos was employed

796
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:02,500
to give Connie her regular facial injections.

797
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,030
My contact at the Home Office gave

798
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,460
me the complete records of Raoul's internet purchases.

799
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,220
He's been bulk-ordering Botox for months.

800
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,100
Bided his time, then upped the strength to a fatal dose.

801
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,780
- Are you sure about this? - I'm sure.

802
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,460
All right, my office.

803
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,060
- Hey, Sherlock, how long? - What?

804
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:16,910
How long have you known?

805
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,020
Well, this one was quite simple, actually like I said.

806
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,180
And the bomber repeated himself. That was a mistake.

807
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,360
No, but Sherlock, the hostage,

808
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,870
the old woman, she's been there all this time!

809
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,770
I knew I could save her.

810
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,620
I also knew that the bomber had given us 12 hours.

811
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,600
I solved the case quickly,

812
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,340
that gave me time to get on with other things.

813
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,380
Don't you see? We're one up on him.

814
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,500


815
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,300
Hello?

816
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,060
Help me!

817
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,180
Tell us where you are.

818
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,820
- Address? - He was so...

819
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,340
His voice...

820
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,300
No, no, no, no! Tell me nothing about him, nothing.

821
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,300
He sounded so soft.

822
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,380
Hello?

823
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,380
Sherlock?

824
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,860
What's happened?

825
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:40,500
The explosion,which ripped through several floors, killing 12 people...- Old block of flats. - ...Caused by a faulty gas main.A spokesman from the utility company...

826
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,180


827
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,940
He certainly gets about.

828
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,220
Well, obviously I lost that round.

829
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,060
Although technically, I did solve the case.

830
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,340
He killed the old lady because she started to describe him.

831
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,340
Just once, he put himself in the firing line.

832
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,820
What d'you mean?

833
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,420
Well, usually, he... must stay above it all.

834
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,220
He organises these things, but no-one ever has direct contact.

835
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:11,500
What, like the Connie Prince murder, he arranged that?

836
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,120
So, people come to him wanting

837
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,620
their crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday?

838
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,660
Novel.

839
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,580
Taking his time this time.

840
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,540
Anything on the Carl Powers case?

841
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,820
Nothing.

842
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,140
All the living classmates check out spotless, no connection.

843
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,260
- Maybe the killer was older than Carl? - The thought had occurred.

844
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,900
So why is he doing this, then?

845
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,700
Playing this game with you. Do you think he wants to be caught?

846
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,140
- I think he wants to be distracted. - Oh...

847
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,020
I hope you'll be very happy together.

848
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,220
Sorry, what?

849
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,220
There are lives at stake, Sherlock.

850
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,340
Actual human lives! Just so I know,

851
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:08,900
do you care about that at all?

852
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,150
- Will caring about them help save them? - Nope.

853
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,890
Then I'll continue not to make that mistake.

854
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,620
- And you find that easy, do you? - Yes, very.

855
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,300
- Is that news to you? - No, no.

856
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,940
I've disappointed you.

857
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,300
That's good, that's a good deduction, yeah.

858
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,180
Don't make people into heroes, John.

859
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,460
Heroes don't exist, and if they did, I wouldn't be one of them.

860
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,500
Excellent.

861
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,420
A view of the Thames.

862
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,740
South Bank, somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.

863
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,820
You check the papers, I'll look online.

864
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,820
Oh, you're angry with me, so you won't help.

865
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,300
Not much cop, this caring lark.

866
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,140


867
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,420


868
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:54,820


869
00:54:25,500 --> 00:50:55,740


870
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,180


871
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:56,420


872
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,290


873
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:09,100


874
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,420


875
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,780


876
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,100


877
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,900


878
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,980
- Archway suicide... - Ten-a-penny.

879
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,140


880
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,180


881
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:17,780


882
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,180


883
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:19,780


884
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,180


885
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,060
Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington.

886
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,740
Ah, man found on the train line, Andrew West.

887
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,260
Nothing!

888
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,790
It's me. Have you found anything on the

889
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,740
South Bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge?

890
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,140
Do you reckon this is connected, then, the bomber?

891
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,820
Must be. Odd, though, he hasn't been in touch.

892
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,020
Then we must assume that

893
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,180
some poor bugger's primed to explode, yeah?

894
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,500
Yes.

895
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,820
- Any ideas? - Seven, so far.

896
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,300
Seven?

897
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,300
He's dead about 24 hours.

898
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,860
- Maybe a bit longer. - Did he drown?

899
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,700


900
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,390
Apparently not.

901
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:46,030
Not enough of the Thames in his lungs.

902
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,140
Asphyxiated.

903
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,780
Yes, I'd agree.

904
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,620


905
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:53,060
There's quite a bit of bruising around the nose and mouth.

906
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,860
More bruises...

907
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,740


908
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,140
here and here.

909
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,380
Fingertips.

910
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:08,290


911
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,420


912
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:06,660


913
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:06,940


914
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:07,780


915
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,420
He's late 30s, I'd say, not in the best condition.

916
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,700
He's been in the river a long while,

917
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,180
the water's destroyed most of the data.

918
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,300
But I'll tell you one thing, that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.

919
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,380
- What? - We need to identify the corpse,

920
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,400
find out about his friends and...

921
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

922
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,340
What painting? What are you on about?

923
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,210
It's all over the place, haven't you seen the posters?

924
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,480
Dutch old master,

925
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,180
supposed to have been destroyed centuries ago.

926
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,780
Now it's turned up, worth 30 million.

927
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,460
OK, so what has that got to do with the stiff?

928
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,100
Everything.

929
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,940
- Have you ever heard of the Golem? - Golem?

930
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,240
It's a horror story, isn't it? What are you saying?

931
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,430
Jewish folk story, a gigantic man made of clay

932
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,340
it's also the name of an assassin.

933
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,490
Real name - Oskar Dzundza.

934
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,460
One of the deadliest assassins in the world.

935
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,460
That is his trademark style.

936
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,340
- So this is a hit? - Definitely.

937
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,580
The Golem squeezes the life out of his victims with his bare hands.

938
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,420
But what has this got to do with that painting? I don't see...

939
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,100
You do see, you just don't observe!

940
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,860
Yes, all right, all right, girls! Calm down.

941
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,100
Sherlock, do you want to take us through it?

942
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,190
What do we know about this corpse?

943
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:15,260
The killer's not left us with much, just the shirt and the trousers.

944
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,540
They're pretty formal, maybe he was going out for the night.

945
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,570
The trousers are heavy duty.

946
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,940
Polyester, nasty, same as the shirt, cheap.

947
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,610
They're both too big for him.

948
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,110
So some kind of standard-issue uniform.

949
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,020
Dressed for work, then. What kind of work?

950
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,780
There's a hook on his belt... for a walkie-talkie.

951
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,580
Tube driver?

952
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,120
- Security guard? - More likely.

953
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,380
- That'll be borne out by his backside. - Backside?!

954
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,620
Flabby, you'd think he'd led a sedentary life.

955
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:41,180
Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent varicose veins in his legs show otherwise.

956
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,940
So, a lot of walking and a lot of sitting around.

957
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,380
Security guard's looking good. The watch helps too.

958
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,460
- The alarm shows he did regular night shifts. - Why regular?

959
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,100
Maybe he just set his alarm like that the night before he died.

960
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,300
No, no, no. The buttons are stiff, hardly touched.

961
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,790
He set his alarm like that a long time ago.

962
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:57,860
His routine never varied.

963
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,580
But there's something else. The killer must have been interrupted,

964
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,220
...otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely.

965
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,420
There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front

966
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,230
...that he tore off,

967
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,660
...suggesting the dead man works somewhere recognisable,

968
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,300
...some kind of institution.

969
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,140
I found this inside his trouser pockets.

970
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,550
Sodden by the river,

971
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,900
- but still recognisably... - Tickets?

972
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,190
Ticket stubs. He worked in a museum or gallery.

973
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:18,900
Did a quick check.

974
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,320
The Hickman Gallery has reported,

975
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:23,420
...one of its attendants as missing - Alex Woodbridge.

976
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,300
Tonight, they unveil the rediscovered masterpiece.

977
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,460
Now, why would anyone want to pay the Golem

978
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,660
...to suffocate a perfectly ordinary gallery attendant?

979
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,900
Inference, the dead man knew something about it,

980
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,420
...something that would stop the owner getting paid 30 million.

981
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,660
- The pictures are fake. - Fantastic.

982
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,900
- Meretricious. - And a Happy New Year.

983
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,020
Poor sod.

984
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,730
I'd better get my feelers out for this Golem character.

985
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,530
Pointless, you'll never find him,

986
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,620
...but I know a man who can.

987
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,820
- Who? - Me.

988
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,780
Why hasn't he phoned?

989
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,340
He's broken his pattern. Why?

990
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,660
- Waterloo Bridge. - Where now, the gallery?

991
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,580
In a bit.

992
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,500
The Hickman's contemporary art, isn't it?

993
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,630
Why have they got hold of an old master?

994
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,140
Don't know.

995
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,220
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.

996
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,660
Need data...

997
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,940
Stop!

998
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,140
Can you wait here?

999
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,260
I won't be a moment.

1000
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,740
Sherlock?

1001
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,420
Change? Any change?

1002
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,340
- What for? - Cup of tea, of course.

1003
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,620
Here you go, 50.

1004
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,340
Thanks.

1005
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,460
- What are you doing? - Investing.

1006
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:18,060
Now we go to the gallery. Have you got any cash?

1007
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,940
No, I need you to find out all you can about the gallery attendant.

1008
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,780
- Lestrade will give you the address. - OK.

1009
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,740


1010
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,300
We'd been sharing about a year.

1011
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,460
Just sharing.

1012
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,820
- May I? - Yeah.

1013
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,740
Sorry.

1014
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,460
Stargazer, was he?

1015
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,260
God, yeah. Mad about it.

1016
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,980
It's all he ever did in his spare time.

1017
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,460
He was a nice guy, Alex.

1018
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,460
I liked him.

1019
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,820
He was, er...

1020
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,980
...never much of a one for hoovering.

1021
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,220
What about art? Did he know anything about that?

1022
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,780
It was just a job, you know?

1023
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,020
Has anyone else been round asking about Alex?

1024
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,220
No.

1025
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,660
We had a break-in, though.

1026
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,540
- When? - Last night.

1027
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,660
There was nothing taken.

1028
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,620
Oh, there was a message left for Alex on the land line.

1029
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,200
- Who was it from? - I can play it for you, if you like.

1030
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,140
- I'll get the phone. - Please.

1031
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,820
"Oh, should I speak now? Alex?

1032
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,620
Love, it's Professor Cairns.

1033
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,660
Listen, you were right. You were bloody right.

1034
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,900
Give us a call when..."

1035
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,660
Professor Cairns?

1036
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,780
No idea, sorry.

1037
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,100
Can I try and ring back?

1038
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,930
No good. I've had other calls since.

1039
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,700
Sympathy ones, you know.

1040
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,000


1041
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,870


1042
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:48,070


1043
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,620
Don't you have something to do?

1044
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,580
Just admiring the view.

1045
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,340
Yes.

1046
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,060
Lovely. Now get back to work.

1047
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:02,820
We open tonight.

1048
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,580
- Doesn't it bother you? - What?

1049
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,940
That the painting's a fake.

1050
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,950
- What? - It's a fake. It has to be.

1051
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:12,820
It's the only possible explanation.

1052
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,870
You are in charge, aren't you, Miss Wenceslas?

1053
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:16,380
Who are you?

1054
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,460
Alex Woodbridge knew that the painting was a fake,

1055
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,380
...so somebody sent the Golem to take care of him. Was it you?

1056
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,340
Golem? What the hell are you talking about?

1057
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,100
Are you working for someone else? Did you fake it for them?

1058
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,580
It's not a fake.

1059
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,380
It is a fake. I don't know why.

1060
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,660
But there's something wrong with it, there has to be.

1061
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,060
What the hell are you on about?

1062
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,700
- You know I could have you sacked on the spot. - Not a problem.

1063
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,500
- No? - No, I don't work here, you see.

1064
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,780
Just popped in to give you a bit of friendly advice.

1065
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,500
How did you get in?

1066
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,700
- Please! - I want to know.

1067
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,020
The art of disguise is knowing how to hide in plain sight.

1068
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,900
- Who are you? - Sherlock Holmes.

1069
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,340
Am I supposed to be impressed?

1070
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,580
You should be.

1071
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,140
Have a nice day.

1072
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:13,540
He wouldn't. He just wouldn't.

1073
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,310
Strange things have happened.

1074
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,860
Westie wasn't a traitor.

1075
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,620
That's a horrible thing to say!

1076
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,460
I'm sorry. But you must understand...

1077
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,140
That's what they think, isn't it, his bosses?

1078
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,210
He was young man, about to get married,

1079
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:28,710
...he had debts.

1080
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:31,460
Everyone's got debts,

1081
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,860
and Westie wouldn't want to clear them by selling out his country.

1082
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:39,860
Can you, er...? Can you tell me exactly what happened that night?

1083
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,220
We were having a night in.

1084
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,220
Just...watching a DVD.

1085
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,660
He normally falls asleep, you know, but he sat through this one.

1086
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,060
He was quiet.

1087
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,780
Out of the blue he said he just had to go and see someone.

1088
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,020
And you've no idea who?

1089
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,460
Hi, Liz. You OK, love?

1090
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,620
- Yeah. - Who's this?

1091
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,260
- John Watson, hi. - This is my brother, Joe.

1092
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,500
John's trying to find out what happened to Westie, Joe.

1093
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,780
- You with the police? - Sort of, yeah.

1094
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,740
Tell them to get off their arses, will you? It's bloody ridiculous.

1095
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,220
I'll do my best.

1096
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:37,300
Thanks very much for your help. Again, I'm very, very sorry.

1097
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,860
He didn't steal those things, Mr Watson.

1098
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,260
I knew Westie, he was a good man.

1099
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,740
He was my good man.

1100
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,900
- Spare change? - No.

1101
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,300
Any spare change?

1102
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,660
Alex Woodbridge didn't know anything special about art.

1103
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,300
- And? - And...

1104
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:25,890
Is that it?

1105
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:27,860
No habits, hobbies, personality?

1106
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:30,140
Give us a chance. He was an amateur astronomer.

1107
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,760
Hold that cab.

1108
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,890
Spare change, sir?

1109
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:33,580
Don't mind if I do.

1110
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,300
Can you wait here?

1111
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:38,550


1112
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,820
Fortunately, I haven't been idle. Come on.

1113
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,420
Beautiful, isn't it?

1114
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,950
I thought you didn't care about...

1115
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:15,060
Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.

1116
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,860
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a message on the answerphone at his flat.

1117
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,860
- A Professor Cairns. - This way.

1118
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,220
Nice. Nice part of town.

1119
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,430
Any time you want to explain?

1120
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:31,380
Homeless network.

1121
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,500
- Really is indispensable. - Homeless network?

1122
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,760
My eyes and ears, all over the city.

1123
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,900
Ah, that's...clever.

1124
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,100
So you scratch their backs, and...?

1125
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,900
Yes, then disinfect myself.

1126
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,580
Sherlock! Come on!

1127
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,200


1128
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,580
What's he doing sleeping rough?

1129
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,730
Well, he has a very distinctive look.

1130
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,300
He has to hide somewhere where tongues won't wag...much.

1131
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,460
- Oh, shit!  - What?

1132
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,620
- I wish I... - Don't mention it.

1133
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,130
No! No! No! No!

1134
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:30,220
It'll take us weeks to find him again.

1135
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,900
Or not. I have an idea where he might be going.

1136
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,220
- What? - I told you, someone left Alex Woodbridge a message.

1137
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:39,700
There can't be that many Professor Cairns in the book. Come on.

1138
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,500
'Jupiter, the fifth planet in our solar system, and the largest.

1139
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,520
'Jupiter is a gas giant.

1140
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,900
Planet Earth would fit into it 11 times.'

1141
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,980
Yes, we know that.

1142
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,860
- 'Titan is the largest moon...' - Come on, Neptune.

1143
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,060
'Many are actually long dead...'

1144
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:16,060
- Tom, is that you? - '..exploded into supernovas.'

1145
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:21,820
'Discovered by Urbain Le Verrier in 1846...'

1146
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:28,780
'..composed mainly of hydrogen.'

1147
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,860
- 'Their light takes so long to reach us...' - Golem!

1148
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,260
'..many are actually long dead, exploded into...'

1149
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,700
- I can't see him. - I'll go round.

1150
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,500
Who are you working for this time, Dzundza?

1151
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,740
'A star begins as a collapsing ball of material composed mainly of...'

1152
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,860
Golem!

1153
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,780
Let him go...

1154
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,180
or I will kill you.

1155
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:15,700
'The fourth planet of the solar system, named after the Roman god of war.'

1156
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:26,340
'..it is a gas giant...'

1157
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,060
'..takes so long to reach us...

1158
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,700
'..into supernovas...'

1159
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:49,380
'..exploded into supernovas...'

1160
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,620
It's a fake. It has to be.

1161
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:56,100
That painting has been subjected to every test known to science.

1162
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,740


1163
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,340


1164
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,900


1165
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,620
It's a very good fake, then.

1166
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:57,020


1167
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:56,980


1168
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,380


1169
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:58,650
You know about this, don't you?

1170
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,580
This is you, isn't it?

1171
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,220
Inspector, my time is being wasted.

1172
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,460
Would you mind showing yourself and your friends out?

1173
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,980
The painting is a fake.

1174
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,740
It's a fake, that's why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed.

1175
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,900
Oh, come on, proving is just a detail. The painting is a fake.

1176
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,900
I've solved it, I've figured it out.

1177
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,860
It's a fake, that's the answer, that's why they were killed.

1178
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,490
OK, I'll prove it. Give me time.

1179
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:32,100
Will you give me time?

1180
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:34,640
 10...
'Ten...'

1181
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,780
It's a kid.

1182
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,250
Oh God, it's a kid.

1183
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,620
- What did he say? - "Ten."

1184
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,820
- 'Nine...' - It's a countdown. He's giving me time.

1185
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:43,380
- Jesus... - It's a fake, but how can I prove it? How?! How?!

1186
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:44,580
 8...
'Eight...'

1187
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,730
This kid will die.

1188
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:47,620
Tell me why the painting is a fake. Tell me!

1189
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,740
- 'Seven...' - No, shut up.

1190
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,940
Don't say anything. It only works if I figure it out.

1191
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:55,380
It must be possible. It must be staring me in the face.

1192
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,820
- 'Six...' - How?

1193
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,180
- Woodbridge knew, but how?! - 'Five...'

1194
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,020
It's speeding up! Sherlock!

1195
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,300
- 'Four... - 'Oh! In the Planetarium, you heard it too.

1196
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,340
Oh, that is brilliant, that is gorgeous!

1197
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,620
- 'Three...' - What's brilliant? What is?!

1198
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,810
This is beautiful.

1199
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,810


1200
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,810


1201
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:11,660
Love this!

1202
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,460
- 'Two...' - Sherlock!

1203
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:15,780
The Van Buren Supernova.

1204
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:21,020
'Please, is somebody there? Somebody help me.'

1205
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,120
There you go.

1206
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,420
Go and find out where he is and pick him up.

1207
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:30,180
Van Buren Supernova, so-called.

1208
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:34,340
Exploding star. Only appeared in the sky in 1858.

1209
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,420
So how could it have been...

1210
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:41,420
painted in the 1640s?

1211
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,620


1212
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:49,020
Oh, Sherl...

1213
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:55,500
You know, it's interesting. Bohemian stationery,

1214
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,980
an assassin named after a Prague legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas.

1215
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,060
This whole case has a distinctly Czech feeling about it.

1216
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,500
Is that where this leads?

1217
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,260
What are we looking at, Inspector?

1218
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:12,420
Well, criminal conspiracy, fraud,

1219
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,260
accessory after the fact, at the very least.

1220
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,660
The murder of the old woman, all the people in the flat...

1221
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,060
I didn't know anything about that.

1222
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,700
All those things, please, believe me.

1223
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:27,500
I just wanted my share.

1224
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,020
The 30 million.

1225
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,780
I found a little old man in Argentina.

1226
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:44,660
A genius - I mean, really.

1227
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,620
Brushwork, immaculate.

1228
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,220
Could fool anyone. Mmm.

1229
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:51,740
Well, nearly anyone.

1230
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:58,900
But I didn't know how to go about convincing the world the picture was genuine.

1231
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,220
It was just an idea.

1232
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,460
A spark which he blew into a flame.

1233
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,180
Who?

1234
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,780
I don't know.

1235
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,340
It's true!

1236
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:16,020
It took a long time, but eventually I was...

1237
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,820
put in touch with people.

1238
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:22,460
His people...

1239
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:26,260
Well, there was never any real contact.

1240
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,140
Just messages...

1241
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:36,260
..whispers.

1242
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,500
And did those whispers have a name?

1243
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,500
Moriarty.

1244
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,460
- So this is where West was found? - Yeah.

1245
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,820
- Are you going to be long? - I might be.

1246
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,060
- Are you the police, then? - Sort of.

1247
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,660
- I hate 'em. - The police?

1248
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,260
No, jumpers.

1249
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,980
People who chuck 'emselves in front of trains. Selfish bastards.

1250
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:22,780
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

1251
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,260
I mean it. It's all right for them.

1252
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,300
It's over in a split second, strawberry jam all over the lines.

1253
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,220
What about the drivers, eh?

1254
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,380
They've got to live with it, haven't they?

1255
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:35,380
Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam, there's no blood on the line.

1256
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,010
Has it been cleaned off?

1257
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,060
No, there wasn't that much.

1258
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,870
You said his head was smashed in.

1259
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:42,540
It was, but there wasn't much blood.

1260
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,360
OK.

1261
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,180
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

1262
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:53,540
- Just give us a shout when you're off. - Right.

1263
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,240
Right, so, Andrew West...

1264
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:01,380
got on the train somewhere. Or did he?

1265
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,020
There was no ticket on the body.

1266
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,460
How did he end up here?

1267
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,420
- The points. - Yes!

1268
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,830
I knew you'd get there eventually.

1269
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,230
West wasn't killed here,

1270
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,300
that's why there was so little blood.

1271
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,540
- How long have you been following me? - Since the start.

1272
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:26,460
You don't think I'd give up on a case like this

1273
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,340
just to spite my brother, do you?

1274
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:31,740
Come on, we've got a bit of burglary to do.

1275
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,140
Missile defence plans haven't left the country,

1276
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:40,780
otherwise Mycroft's people would have heard about it.

1277
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:44,060
Despite what people think, we do still have a secret service.

1278
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,300
Yeah, I know, I've met them.

1279
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,320
Which means whoever stole the memory stick

1280
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,460
can't sell it or doesn't know what to do with it.

1281
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,340
My money's on the latter.

1282
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,940
We're here.

1283
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,580
Where?

1284
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,660
Sherlock! What if there's someone in?

1285
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,380
There isn't.

1286
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:15,380
Jesus...

1287
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:17,560
Where are we?

1288
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,220
Oh, sorry, didn't I say? Joe Harrison's flat.

1289
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,700
Joe...?

1290
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,860
Brother of West's fiancee. He stole the memory stick,

1291
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,180
killed his prospective brother-in-law.

1292
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,260
Then why did he do it?

1293
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,740
Let's ask him.

1294
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,460
Don't! Don't.

1295
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,700
Wasn't meant to...

1296
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:14,460
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.

1297
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,740
Why did you kill him?

1298
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:18,940
It was an accident. I swear it was.

1299
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:23,860
But stealing the plans for the missile defence program wasn't an accident, was it?

1300
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:26,020
I started dealing drugs.

1301
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,940
I mean, the bike thing's a great cover, right?

1302
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:34,940
I don't know how it started. I just got out of my depth.

1303
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:39,380
I owed people thousands. Serious people.

1304
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:44,020
Then at Westie's engagement do, he starts talking about his job.

1305
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,100
I mean, usually, he's so careful.

1306
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:53,980
'But that night, after a few pints, he really opened up.

1307
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,260
'He told me about these missile plans.

1308
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,940
'Beyond top secret.

1309
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:02,820
He showed me the memory stick, he waved it in front of me.

1310
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,580
You hear about these things getting lost,

1311
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,620
ending up on rubbish tips and whatnot.

1312
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:10,940
But there it was. And I thought...

1313
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:13,980
'Well, I thought it could be worth a fortune.

1314
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:17,020
It was pretty easy to get the thing off him, he was so plastered.'

1315
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:21,900
Next time I saw him,

1316
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:25,180
I could tell by the look on his face that he knew.

1317
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:29,180
- What are you doing here? - What have you done with the plans?

1318
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,780
What happened?

1319
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:41,020
I was going to call an ambulance, but it was too late.

1320
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:46,420
I just didn't have a clue what to do. So I dragged him in 'ere.'

1321
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:49,700
I just sat in the dark, thinking.

1322
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,140
When a neat little idea popped into your head.

1323
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:36,500
Carrying Andrew West way away from here.

1324
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,380
His body would have gone on for ages

1325
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:41,460
if the train hadn't hit a stretch of track that curved.

1326
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,580
- And points. - Exactly.

1327
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,820
Do you still have it, then - the memory stick?

1328
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:54,340
Fetch it for me, if you wouldn't mind.

1329
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,900
Distraction over - the game continues.

1330
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,540
Maybe that's over, too. We've heard nothing from the bomber.

1331
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,980
Five pips, remember, John.

1332
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:13,820
It's a countdown. We've only had four.

1333
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:22,020
No, no, no! Course he's not the boy's father.

1334
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,220
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!

1335
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:30,700
I knew it was dangerous. Getting you into crap telly.

1336
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,500
Not a patch on Connie Prince.

1337
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,980
Have you given Mycroft the memory stick yet?

1338
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:37,900
Yep. He was over the moon.

1339
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,740
Threatened me with a knighthood...again.

1340
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:45,500
- You know, I'm still waiting. - Hm?

1341
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,460
For you to admit that a little knowledge of the solar system

1342
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:51,060
and you'd have cleared up the fake painting a lot quicker.

1343
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,660
It didn't do you any good, did it?

1344
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:55,220
No, but I'm not the world's only consulting detective.

1345
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,900
- True. - I won't be in for tea.

1346
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:01,020
I'm going to Sarah's. There's still some of that risotto left in the fridge.

1347
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,620
- Milk, we need milk. - I'll get some.

1348
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,380
- Really? - Really.

1349
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:10,260
- And some beans, then? - Mm.

1350
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:34,260


1351
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:43,260


1352
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:27,340
Bought you a little getting-to-know-you present.

1353
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,900
That's what it's all been for, isn't it?

1354
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,820
All your little puzzles, making me dance.

1355
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:38,220
All to distract me from this.

1356
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,820
Evening.

1357
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,380
This is a turn-up, isn't it, Sherlock?

1358
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,550
John! What the hell...?

1359
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,540
Bet you never saw this coming.

1360
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:16,980
What...would you like me to make him say...next?

1361
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:23,900
- Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear. - Stop it.

1362
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:27,180
Nice touch, this. The pool,

1363
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:29,700
where little Carl died.

1364
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:35,420
I stopped him. I can stop John Watson, too.

1365
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:40,300
- Stop his heart. - Who are you?

1366
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:44,460
I gave you my number.

1367
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:47,060
I thought you might call.

1368
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,700
Is that a British Army Browning L9A1 in your pocket,

1369
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:08,220
or are you just pleased to see me?

1370
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,540
Both.

1371
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:16,100
Jim Moriarty. Hi.

1372
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,500
Jim?

1373
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,620
Jim from the hospital?

1374
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,780
Oh, did I really make such a fleeting impression?

1375
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:31,140
But then, I suppose, that was rather the point.

1376
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:37,420
Don't be silly. Someone else is holding the rifle.

1377
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,460
I don't like getting my hands dirty.

1378
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:46,240
I've given you a glimpse, Sherlock,

1379
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,020
just a teensy glimpse

1380
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:52,700
of what I've got going on out there in the big bad world.

1381
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:56,100
I'm a specialist, you see.

1382
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,740
Like you.

1383
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,220
Dear Jim...

1384
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:04,460
..please will you fix it for me

1385
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:07,740
to get rid of my lover's nasty sister?

1386
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:10,390
Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me

1387
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,580
to disappear to South America?

1388
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,180
Just so.

1389
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:16,260
Consulting criminal.

1390
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:20,100
- Brilliant. - Isn't it?

1391
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:23,020
No-one ever gets to me.

1392
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:26,500
And no-one ever will.

1393
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,700
I did.

1394
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,020
You've come the closest. Now you're in my way.

1395
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,860
- Thank you. - Didn't mean it as a compliment.

1396
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:34,020
- Yes, you did. - Yeah, OK, I did.

1397
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:35,780
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

1398
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,740
Daddy's had enough now.

1399
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,220
I've shown you what I can do.

1400
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:45,140
I cut loose all those people, all those little problems,

1401
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,020
even 30 million quid,

1402
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,900
just to get you to come out and play.

1403
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:53,060
So take this as a friendly warning... my dear.

1404
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:55,780
Back off.

1405
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,100
Although I have loved this,

1406
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,020
this little game of ours.

1407
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,490
Playing Jim from IT. Playing gay.

1408
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:08,660
Did you like the little touch with the underwear?

1409
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:11,460
- People have died. - That's what people do!

1410
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:17,300
- I will stop you. - No, you won't.

1411
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,660
Are you all right?

1412
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,820
You can talk, Johnny boy.

1413
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:25,220
Go ahead.

1414
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:28,940
- Take it. - Mm? .

1415
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,300
Oh...that? The missile plans.

1416
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:38,900
Boring!

1417
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,940
I could've got them anyway.

1418
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,340
Sherlock, run!

1419
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:46,860
Good!

1420
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:50,140
Very good.

1421
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,840
If your sniper pulls that trigger, Mr Moriarty,

1422
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,340
then we both go up.

1423
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,550
Isn't he sweet?

1424
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:57,820
I can see why you like having him around.

1425
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:00,740
But then, people do get so sentimental about their pets.

1426
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,660
They're so touchingly loyal.

1427
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:03,900
But oops!

1428
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:08,700
You've rather shown your hand there, Dr Watson.

1429
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,580
Gotcha.

1430
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,370
Westwood.

1431
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,310
Do you know what happens if you don't leave me alone,

1432
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,780
Sherlock? To you?

1433
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:27,620
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.

1434
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,140
Kill you?

1435
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,090
No, don't be obvious.

1436
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,540
I mean, I'm going to kill you anyway, some day.

1437
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,420
I don't want to rush it, though.

1438
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:37,620
I am saving it up for something special.

1439
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:41,620
No, no, no, no, no. If you don't stop prying,

1440
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:43,620
I'll burn you.

1441
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:50,620
I'll burn the heart out of you.

1442
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:55,380
I have been reliably informed that I don't have one.

1443
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:57,380
But we both know that's not quite true.

1444
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:04,660
Well, I'd better be off.

1445
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,940
Well, so nice to have had a proper chat.

1446
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,780
What if I was to shoot you now?

1447
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,100
Right now?

1448
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,380
Then you could cherish the look of surprise on my face.

1449
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,180
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.

1450
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,900
Really, I would.

1451
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:24,540
And just a teensy bit...disappointed.

1452
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,660
And of course, you wouldn't be able to cherish it for very long.

1453
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,700
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

1454
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:40,980
Catch you...later.

1455
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,940
No, you won't!

1456
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,780
All right? Are you all right?

1457
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:56,940
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock...

1458
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:58,780
Sherlock!

1459
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:06,980
Oh, Christ.

1460
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:20,980
- Are you OK? - Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

1461
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:27,420
That, er...thing that you...that you did,

1462
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:32,940
that, um...you offered to do...that was, um...good.

1463
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:38,420
- I'm glad no-one saw that. - Mm?

1464
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:41,500
You ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool.

1465
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,580
People might talk.

1466
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:46,420
They do little else.

1467
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:53,070
Oh...

1468
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:56,500
Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!

1469
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,260
It is a weakness with me, but to be fair to myself,

1470
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:01,060
it is my only weakness.

1471
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,900
You can't be allowed to continue.

1472
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,500
You just can't.

1473
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,060
I would try to convince you,

1474
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,940
but everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.

1475
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,180
Probably my answer has crossed yours.

1476
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:57,200
