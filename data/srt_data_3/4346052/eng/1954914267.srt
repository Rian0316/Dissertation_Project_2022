1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,720
Klaus: In the beginning,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,920
we were so naive.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,790
Our mother hade made us
into beasts

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,770
that fed on blood,

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,470
but immortality was
beyond our grasp,

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,740
compulsion a trick
we had yet to learn.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,350
All we knew was a fear
of being hunted.

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,920
That and a terrible hunger.

9
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,560
So we ran...

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,460
As a family...

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,260
And when we needed to...

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,070
As a family...

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,870
We fed.

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,040
Unh!

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,210
[Neighing]

16
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,310
Kol, are you quite done?

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,680
Ahh.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,210
Oh, bother, Elijah.
Is all this truly necessary?

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,740
Brother, the road is
a major thoroughfare.

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,850
If the bodies are found,
word of our presence

21
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,120
will spread to mikael.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,890
We have run through
autumn and winter,

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,990
through sleet and snow.

24
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,190
Are we cursed to
forever live in fear
of our father?

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,850
I should say yes sadly.

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,660
Finn, please.
Niklaus.

27
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,360
Do we have any idea
where we're running
to next?

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,060
Why not just do
what we've all
thought of doing?

29
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,240
Split up.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,300
We swore a vow.

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,800
Your vows haunt me
more than father himself.

32
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,480
At least he can't chase us all.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,630
I say we take our chances.

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,750
Perhaps kol is right.

35
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,850
Thank you, finn.
Yeah, I've always said

36
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,650
eldest is the most intelligent.

37
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,920
Stop talking!

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,490
I take no joy in our assent,

39
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,820
but I do wish to sleep in a bed,

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,050
to bathe in a bath,
to feed of proper food.

41
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,530
If we divide...

42
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,730
Elijah: No, brother.

43
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,130
Niklaus is right.
We made a vow.

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,870
Family above all.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,930
Always...

46
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,170
Forever.

47
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,080
Always and forever indeed.

48
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,600
Freya, voice-over:
"My dear rebekah...

him for sparring.

"And he has much anger."

No. Witches don't do
favors for vampires,

84
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,290
including daylight rings.

85
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
Those are the rules.

86
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,435
An act of good
faith will help
keep the peace.

87
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:13,460
The ninth ward coven
thinks I'm a vampire
sympathizer.

88
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,270
I won't prove them right.

89
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,570
You're on your own.

Thanks for coming.

Why did you ask me
to meet you here?

107
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,010
Well, I had hoped
we might have one
of our little chats,

108
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,810
and I thought you might
appreciate the change
of venue,

109
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,350
so I'm allowing you
a private tour

110
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,280
of my exhibition.

111
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,360
These are yours?

112
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,630
Heh.

113
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,030
I spent the better part
of a millennia

114
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,570
trying not to draw
my father's attention,

115
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,360
and now he's dead,

116
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,600
and all those
who stood against me

117
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,770
have been vanquished.

118
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,410
I see no reason
the fruits of my labor

119
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,570
should go unappreciated.

120
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,140
I didn't come here
to appreciate art.

121
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,750
If you want to talk
about your progress

122
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,720
as a person striving
for empathy, fine.

123
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,790
If not, I'll go.

124
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,620
Have I offended you?

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,190
I agreed to see you
professionally,

126
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,930
but I was very clear
when I set our boundaries,

127
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,630
and they don't include
private art shows.

128
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,600
Oh. Well, then
perhaps you'd prefer

129
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,940
to escort me
to tomorrow's opening.

130
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,640
Call me if you want to talk.

131
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,050
Wait.

132
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,910
You're worried
no one else will come.

133
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,320
Rebekah's gone, marcel's angry,

134
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,420
Elijah won't even look at you.

135
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,760
You'll be alone.

136
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,130
You're scared because
the people you love
are angry with you.

137
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,330
Maybe you need to think
about that.

138
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,660
[Cell phone chimes]

139
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,770
I have to go.

[Siren]

141
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,610
Vincent: Ok. The thing
you got to understand

142
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,270
is me and nola pd got
a relationship

143
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,180
that goes back
to that nastiness
with my ex-wife.

144
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,250
I'm their expert
in anything that
seems occult,

145
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,010
and every so often,
they come across
the aftermath

146
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,750
of some black magic,
and they call me in.

147
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,990
This your friend the shrink?

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,530
Fantastic.
Will Kinney,
detective, homicide.

149
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,460
Cami O'Connell, bartender,

150
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,070
part-time shrink.

151
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,870
Why am I here?

152
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,270
Vince, show her the body.

153
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,700
We'll see if she
can do what you
said she can do.

154
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,570
So the cops want
a psychological profile,

155
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,140
and given what we've found,

156
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,010
I'd say this is
your area of expertise.

157
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,600
She's getting bigger
by the second.

158
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,350
Thank you for all of your care.

159
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,950
Tomorrow's the full moon.

160
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,220
I can help you
bring hope to hayley
if you'd like.

161
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,850
Won't be necessary.

162
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,550
You deserve a night off.

163
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,080
I'd offer to accompany
you myself,

164
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,725
but I fear my fragile ego
could not endure

165
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:30,390
the litany of insults
hayley has no doubt prepared.

166
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,750
Yes, I doubt that your presence

167
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
is particularly welcome
anywhere.

168
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,370
My own brother
greeting me
with such disdain.

169
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,970
What do you think, freya?

170
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,500
Is he still angry
for my part
in hayley's curse?

171
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,960
Need I remind him
it was my ploy that
kept her alive.

172
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,470
But of course.
Forgive me.

173
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,770
So you would call this
an act of heroism,

174
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,780
even as you bask in her torment?

175
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,415
Perhaps I'd be more sympathetic

176
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,810
if hayley apologized.

177
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,090
After all, it was
her that tried to run off

178
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,280
with my daughter.

179
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,320
Freya: Oh, if you
two must poke

534
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,630
My fate is linked to yours.

535
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,840
If you want to know what I do

536
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,260
about the dangers you now face,

537
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,440
trust me enough to come with me.

538
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,010
There is something
that you must see.

539
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,150
[Grunting]

540
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,530
I'd ask if everything was ok,

541
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,630
but you wouldn't be here
if it were.

542
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,040
You know, I was bored
out of my mind when I
lived up here.

543
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,910
I don't miss it,
but things were
a lot simpler.

544
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,990
And at least I felt safe.

545
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,520
What happened?

546
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,250
I was attacked.

547
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,860
One of my own people
tried to use a spell
to ruin my hands.

548
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,560
What's next, my eyes, my heart?

549
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,920
They hate me.
I knew that,

550
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,590
but I didn't think
they would just revolt.

551
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,370
Witches in new Orleans
have a habit

552
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,770
of getting homicidal, all right?

553
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,010
Why do you think I was
so hard on them?

554
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,530
But I'm regent.
They should respect me.

555
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,010
I didn't sign up for this.

556
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,180
Sure you did.
You chose to be their leader.

557
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,210
The target on your back,
it comes with the job.

558
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,570
So what do I do?

559
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,350
Say the word, all right?
Me and my guys will...

560
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,920
You'll what?

561
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,450
They see me
siding with you
against my own kind,

562
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,350
I'll just be proving them right.

563
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,020
"D," someone came at you.

564
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,850
It might be one today,
but if you sit back

565
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,030
and do nothing,
but tomorrow,
there'll be more.

566
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,260
You got to respond
with a show of force.

567
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,790
If not me, find another way,

568
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,110
but it's got to be done.

569
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,550
Hello, sweetie.

570
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,380
We'll have to excuse
your auntie freya.

571
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,230
I've had a few
big girl drinks tonight.

572
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,840
What the hell are you doing?

573
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,690
Oh, my goodness.

574
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,620
Where are my manners?

575
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,950
Permit me to explain.

576
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,290
Ohh! Unh!

583
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,730
How precious.

584

And just in time for lesson two.

00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,000
Please excuse the mess.

[Dance music playing]

588
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,310
Well, you never were
one for subtlety.

589
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,720
Heh.

590
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,240
You brought me here
to have a seance?

591
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,750
Something like that.

592
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,480
I present
my personal forecaster...

593
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,890
The lovely Alexis.

594
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,650
Don't tell me you're
here to scry

595
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,420
some future portents of my doom.

596
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,660
Alexis is no back alley
palm reader.

597
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,870
She's an expert cipher
of patterns, trends, cycles.

598
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,270
She's extraordinary
on the stock market

599
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,850
and never fails
to guess the winner
of "the bachelorette."

A touch forward, isn't she?

Your ancient heart beats
strong indeed

604
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,580
for someone in such danger.

If you have a warning
to deliver, luv,

best get on with it.

607
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,860
By all means,

608
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,740
but if you want the most
from the experience,

609
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,530
I suggest you feed on me.

610

As you do, I'll allow
you into my mind.

611

Drink deep, but beware.

What you broke is past repair.

All your oaths you betray.

that nothing lasts

Do you know where she is?

Judging by what
these hunters did,

the traps they set
and the blood I saw,

if she's not with her daughter,

What are the police gonna do?

00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,850
We'd be sending
the arresting officers
to get slaughtered,

654
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,320
and if we warned them,
we'd get locked up
for being insane.

Yeah.

I've been worried that
you've lost a step.

I need no reminding of who I am.

That truth has been clear
to me for a thousand years.

And in those years,
you've acquired
countless enemies,

I told her to make
peace at all cost,
and she refused me.

712
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,470
All right. That girl's
got a bigger chip
on her shoulder

713
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,570
than you do.

714
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,040
[Both grunting]

715
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
You got her into this.
You should be
helping her out.

716
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,480
These witches keep
messing with her,
she's gonna get angry.

717
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,840
You think that's gonna
end well for anyone?

718
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,790
Huh?

719
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,590
[Sighs]

720
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,990
[Breathing heavily]

721
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,270
What the hell am I doing here?

722
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,410
Why am I trapped?

723
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,840
I used magic to draw you here

724
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,440
and to keep you
a captive audience.

725
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,470
Davina, I need to see
my daughter.

726
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm sorry,

727
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,250
but there's something
I need you to do
for me first.

728
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,900
[Gasps]

729
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,160
Who's there?

730
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,320
You're on edge.

731
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,530
[Gasps]

732
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,930
And you're trespassing.

733
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,270
You can't just come...
I mean, Klaus,
seriously.

734
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,560
I didn't come here to quarrel.

735
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,170
I came to offer you a gift,

736
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,345
maybe in exchange
for one of our little chats

737
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:50,970
of which I'm in particular need,

738
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,020
given as my brother
doesn't bother
to answer my calls,

739
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,280
and now my old mate
lucien has swanned
into town

740
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,910
with all manner
of troubling news.

741
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,560
Fine. If you want to
talk it through,
come back tomorrow.

742
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,980
I'm afraid I need to
talk about it now.

743
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,260
No. No!

744
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,800
You don't get to just
come into my house
uninvited.

745
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,330
Well, you already
invited me in once, luv,
so technically...

746
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,560
Don't do that.

747
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,670
Don't be so flippant
and self-absorbed.

748
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,000
Right now, people
like me are out there
getting killed

749
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,960
by people like you,

750
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,770
conveniently timed
with the arrival

751
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,830
of your old acquaintance,

752
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,400
and you just barge
in here and start
mouthing off orders?

753
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,170
I get it.
You're a vampire.

754
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,580
It's a tortured existence.

755
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,910
I'm sorry, but do you
really have to be

756
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,120
such an insensitive
disappointment?

757
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,960
Wait.

758
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
That wasn't fair.

759
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,120
Keep the gift.

760
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,940
I painted it for you.

761
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,740
Klaus.

762
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,190
[Saxophone playing]

763
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,620
Good evening.

764
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,330
I wonder if we might discuss

765
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,260
your analysis of my work.

766
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,440
Aah!

767
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,870
[Klaus growls]

768
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,430
[Grunting]

769
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,770
Raah!

770
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,640
Noooo!

771
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,020
It won't be long now.
