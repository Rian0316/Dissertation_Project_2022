<i>孩子们  在2012年年末</i>
<i>Kids, in late 2012,</i>

15
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,580
<i>我收到了一条非常重要的短信</i>

<i>巴尼叔叔和罗宾阿姨订婚了</i>

<i>我们中的某人倒是不怎么开心</i>
<i>one of us was definitely not happy</i>

20
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,180
马文止不住地哭啊
Marvin will not stop crying.

21
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,390
你们觉得是什么原因  是不是肚子饿了
What do you guys think it is? Is he hungry?

22
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,780
肯定是这个原因
Well, that must be it!

23
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
真是一语惊醒梦中人啊  泰德
Thank you for thinking of that, Ted!

24
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,240
瞧瞧我们俩  只知道给他浇水
And here we were, just watering him,

25
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,640
让他朝阳  进行光合作用
facing him towards sun light!

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,100
抱歉  自新年起  我就没睡过觉
Sorry, I haven't slept in... January.

27
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,230
马文进食不是问题
Food going in isn't the problem.

28
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,420
排便才是  又或者说没有排便
It's what's coming out, or not coming out.

29
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,060
他已经3天没有便便了
He hasn't pooped in three days.

30
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,480
一般来说  我对脏尿布是恨之入骨
Normally, I wouln't wish one of his dirty diapers on my worst enemy.

31
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,650
但现在  我倒是挺想念早晨打开尿布的时光
But now, I kinda miss pop in the hood in the morning,

32
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,160
-看见那大条多汁  黑乎乎的...  -莉莉
- and finding that first big, juicy, black--  - Lily!

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,030
我这正吃香辣炖肉酱呢  莉莉
I'm eating chili. I'm eating chili, Lily.

34
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,550
彩条
confetti!

35
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,240
简直就是彩条大爆炸啊
Big blast of confetti!

36
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,770
一般来说  那孩子就是彩条喷射机啊
Normally, the kid's a confetti machine.

37
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,070
他就是婴儿版的雷普・泰勒
He's Rip Taylor in a diaper.

38
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,070
美国喜剧演员  经常以撒彩条方式登场

39
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,120
我有预感  这个时刻
I have a feeling at this point,

40
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,500
我家的雷普・泰勒又在喷"彩条"了
Rip Taylor is Rip Taylor in a diaper.

41
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,120
如此生动的视觉形容  这饭是不用吃了
And with that image, dinner is done.

42
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,270
-伙计们  -啧啧
- Hey, guys.  - Well, well, well.

43
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,150
新娘驾到
Here comes the bride.

44
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,320
最棘手的部分要开始了  对吧
Now the annoying part, right?

45
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,690
策划婚礼
Planning the wedding?

46
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,360
太无趣了  对吧
So not fun, right?

47
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,110
怎么说呢  我还挺期待的
I don't know-- I'm kind of looking forward to it.

48
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,150
好吧  那我就帮帮你吧
Fine, I'll do it for you.

49
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,990
首先要定好时间
First thing we need to do is set a date.

50
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,840
2013年5月25日

51
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,690
谢谢你  泰德
Thank you, Ted.

52
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,010
女人说话  男人闪边
The ladies are talking.

53
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,460
其实  这就是婚期
Actually, that is the date.

54
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,410
泰德毛遂自荐  帮忙策划了一点
Ted offered to help with the planning a little.

55
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,370
然后呢...
And, well, uh...

56
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,430
这文件夹真够大的
That's a big binder.

57
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,740
这个吗
Oh, this?

58
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,660
这只是婚礼蛋糕的内容而已
This is just cakes.

59
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,620
对了  典礼地点选在
Anyway, we're having the ceremony

60
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,770
长岛上那个美丽的小教堂
at that beautiful little church out on Long Island,

61
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,280
也就是我和维多利亚差点结婚的地方
where Victoria almost got married-- lovely spot.

62
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,690
在酒店前的草坪  搭一个巨大的白色帐篷
And then we're gonna have a reception in a big white tent

63
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,150
用来宴请宾客
on the front lawn of the hotel.

64
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,380
颜色嘛  以乳白和淡紫为主
Oh, and, uh, the colors are cream and lilac.

65
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,950
老娘要把你碎尸万段  贱人
I will cut you, bitch.

66
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,690
别  莉莉...
No, L-L-Lily...

67
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,300
我没事  没事了
I'm cool, I'm cool.

68
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,830
罗宾  巴尼人呢
Hey, Robin, where's Barney?

69
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,220
才订婚就跑路了吗
Did he skip town already?

70
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,310
若真是跑了  什么时候跑的
If so, exactly what time was it?

71
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,270
具体时间对于赌注输赢很重要
It's important for the over/under.

72
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,310
巴尼没事  只是  今天早晨...
Barney's fine, it's just... well, earlier this morning...

73
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,550
距我答应你求婚已经三天了
So, it's been three days since I said yes.

74
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,670
的确
True.

75
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,680
你的恐慌发作的时间也越来越短  
And your panic attacks are getting

76
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,360
次数越来越少
shorter and further apart.

77
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,780
我办不到  我快要窒息而亡了
I can't do this! I feel like I'm drowning!

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,860
确实如此
Also true.

79
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,210
看来我们可以正式算订婚了
So I guess we're officially engaged.

80
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,340
或许我们该通知一下父母吧
Maybe we should tell our parents.

81
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,520
我猜我爸已经知道了吧  你给他打过电话
I assume my dad already knows-- you did call him

82
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,860
得到了他的允许  对吧
and got his permission, right?

83
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,530
是啊  是啊  罗宾
Yeah, yeah, Robin.

84
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,390
你是我用几头公牛和来自东土的香料换回来的
I bought you with an ox and some spices from the East.

85
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,070
他要把你关在笼子里
Uh, he's gonna put you in a cage.

86
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,320
放在马背上  运到我那偏远的沙漠营地里
and send you on horseback to my remote desert camp.

87
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,300
-好了  巴尼  -慢着  我还没说完
- Okay, Barney...   - Hold on, I'm not done.

88
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,310
你用香水和精油沐浴净身
Where you'll be bathed in perfumes and oils

89
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,670
然后送至我的帐篷中
and delivered to my tent.

90
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,700
在你表演完那传统的七重面纱之舞后  
After you perform the traditional Dance of the Seven Veils,

91
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,280
我们将躺在虎皮地毯上...
we'll adjourn to the tiger skin rug where we'll...

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
-巴尼  -罗宾
- Barney...  - Robin!

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,190
我俩若想共筑婚姻
If we're gonna build a marriage together,

94
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,550
就千万不要总是打断对方说话
we have got to stop interrupting each other all the time.

95
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,720
行吧  讲完你的故事
Fine, finish your story.

96
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,340
谢谢
Thank you.

97
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,340
翻云覆雨
Where we'll do it.

98
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,780
你有得到我爸的允许吗
Did you ask for my father's permission?

99
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,150
没有
No, I did not.

100
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,910
你们也知道  我爹有点小可怕
So, as some of you know, my dad is a little scary.

101
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,950
才有点吗  你爸堪称食死徒般的可怕
A little? Dude's a stone cold Slytherin.

102
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,210
他面露凶光  总感觉像是刚抽完
He always looks like he just came from slapping

103
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,960
某个捆在密室椅子上的人的耳光
some guy tied to a chair in a back room.

104
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
总之  我们三个一同吃午餐
Anyway, we go get lunch...

105
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,550
听着  我知道我警告过你
Look, I know I already told you this,

106
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,480
但我爸真的很可怕
but my dad is a scary guy.

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,910
拜托  我能搞定他
Please, I think I can handle...

108
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,490
不惧光的吸血鬼  不惧光的吸血鬼啊  
Oh, vampire in the daylight, vampire in the daylight!

109
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,790
天啊
Oh, my God.

110
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,570
你好  罗宾

把手拿开
Put that thing away,

113
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,900
给你老爸一个拥抱
Give your old man a hug.

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,770
而噩梦才刚刚开始
And then it got really scary.

115

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,420
什么...怎么...  卡罗尔是谁
When... Da... who's Carol?

120
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,910
对哦  你还没见过卡罗尔呢
Oh, right, you haven't met Carol, um...

121
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,700

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,300
为了她我才搬到纽约来

125
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,810
8个月前就来了  谢谢您现在才告诉我
Eight months ago. Thanks for the call, by the way.

126
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,790

Well, I figured you knew.

127
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,010
我在脸书页面上更新了
It's on my Facebook page.

128
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,600
你真应该通过我的好友申请
You really should respond to my friend request.

129
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,710
我经常贴一些很棒的东西
I post a lot of great stuff.

130
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,730
你知道什么是"网络爆红"吗
Are you familiar with memes?

131
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,540
一只猫竟然说
There's a cat who says,

132
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,530
"我想吃芝士汉堡"
"I can has cheeseburger?"

133
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,210
你到底怎么了
Okay, what the hell happened to you?

134
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,560
罗宾  我知道过去  我一直...
Robin, I know in the past, I have been...

135
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,690
挺冷漠的
emotionally distant.

136
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,660
但是卡罗尔发掘了
But Carol has brought out

137
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,870
我全新的一面
a whole new side of me.

138
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,580
我有了全新的人生观
I have a new outlook on life

139
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,460
无忧无虑逍遥自在  就像我的信条
a devil-may-care insouciance that embodies the credo,

140
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,450
"没衣服  没鞋子  没问题"
"No shirt, no shoes, no problem."

141
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,890
罗宾
Robin...

142
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,120
我变得有趣了
I'm fun now.

143
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,880
天啊
Oh, God.

144
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,350
-他变得有趣了吗  -听起来一点也不有趣啊
- He's fun now? - That does not sound fun.

145
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,890
孩子不该看到家长变成那个样子
No child should have to see a parent go through that.

146
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,810
这样的话  巴尼对见家长这件事的
Well, it probably took some of the pressure

147
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,980
压力应该减轻不少吧
off the Barney of it all.

148
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,140
您好  先生
Sir, hi.

149
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,380
我叫巴尼・斯丁森

150
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,230
这是巴尼吗
This is Barney?

151
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,460
这货居然是金发
This man is blond.

152
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,480
成熟男人才不会留金发呢
Grown men are not blond.

153
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,940
爸爸
Dad.

154
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,620
很高兴见到你
Pleased to meet you.

155
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,250
你的头发...
That's a very...

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,580
颜色真搞笑
fun hair color.

157
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,790
那不算什么  他和我见面时第一句话是
That's nothing-- when he met me, his first words were,

158
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,250
-女衬衫不错  -你穿的就是女衬衫
- "Nice blouse" - You were wearing a blouse.

159
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,350
才不是女衬衫呢
It was not a blouse!

160
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,790
太好了  你们都在
Oh, great. You're all here.

161
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,250
商讨一下婚礼乐队的事吧
Let's talk about our wedding band.

162
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,490
你们觉得他们应该有多嗨
How much do you guys think they should rock?

163
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,820
我觉得应该嗨翻天
'Cause I vote, a million.

164
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,680
是啊  我们早就定好DJ了啊
Yeah, yeah, I think we already settled on a DJ, so...

165
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,300
莉莉  你还记得你们结婚时
Lily, do you remember the band you guys

166
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,470
差点请的乐队吗
almost hired for your wedding?

167
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,630
何止记得
Remember them?

168
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,010
我可以帮你打电话预定
I'll call them up and book them for you.

169
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,370
只要你一句话
Just say the word.

170
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,740
是啊  是啊  我觉得我们又绕回来
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel like we keep coming back

171
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,480
说DJ的事了
to this DJ thing.

172
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,580
你觉得呢  宝贝
What do you think, baby?

173
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,700
我觉得现在决定  还为时尚早
Yeah, I don't think anyone should book anything right now.

174
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,460
为什么
Why not?

175
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,220
我要去标有"意大利面"的洗手间了
Well, I am going to go the room marked "Spaghettis,"

176
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,310
但愿那是女厕
which I'm hoping is the ladies room.

177
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,660
"肉球"什么的应该是指男厕  对吧
"Meatballs" Has to be men's, right?

178
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,140
虽然我搞不懂"鱿鱼"代表的是什么鬼东西
I don't know what the hell "Calamaris" Is.

179
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,250
先生  我...
Sir, I-I-I...

180
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,290
我不准
Permission denied.

181
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,590
结果  "意大利面"是男厕
And it turns out, "Spaghettis" are men.

182
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
我还看见了一根"面条"
I saw a noodle.

183
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,420
-他不同意吗  -对啊  我不知道该如何是好  
- He said no? - Yeah, I don't know what we're gonna do.

184
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,540
别紧张  宝贝  交给我
Relax, baby. I got this.

185
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,500
我知道如何说服他人
I know how to be persuasive.

186
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,750
<i>第二天  巴尼叔叔约罗宾的爸爸</i>
<i>The next day, Uncle Barney met Robin's dad</i>

187
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,730
<i>在同一家餐厅吃午饭</i>

188
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,400
<i>这次  他制定了计划</i>
<i>This time, with a plan.</i>

189
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,110
您好  特布罗斯基先生
Hello, Mr. Scherbatsky.

190
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,780
我想我第一次没给您留下好印象
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

191
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,030
你现在吸引到我的注意了
You have my attention.

192
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,270
我让"肉球"待在家里
I left the meatball at home

193
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,980
这样我们就能"面"对"面"谈谈
so I could talk to you spaghetti to spaghetti.

194
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,660
先生
Sir...

195
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,510
我是诚心诚意想娶您的女儿
I'm very serious about marrying your daughter.

196
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,400
巴尼  我想和罗宾的妈妈结婚时
Barney, when I wanted to marry Robin's mother,

197
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,030
我赤手空拳屠杀了
I slaughtered a whole family of bears

198
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,860
一窝熊
with my bare hands.

199
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,400
我把熊皮
I gave the pelts

200
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,600
和熊肉给她爸爸作为聘礼
and the bear meat to her father as tribute.

201
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,050
你知道这在加拿大叫什么吗
You know what we call that in Canada?

202
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,650
规矩
Manners.

203
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,770
你们想来一杯"山崩"饮料吗
Would either of you like a mudslide?

204
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,520
我刚"崩"过了  谢谢
I just had one. Thank you.

205
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,260
我要一杯浮彩绚丽彩虹奶昔
I'll have a Jazzy Pizzazzy Razzleberry Rainbow Milkshake

206
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,180
上面插一根弯吸管
with a swirly straw?

207
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,790
你忘了说那个神奇的[请]字哦
You didn't say the magic word.

208
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,150
小的这就去拿您的饮料
I'll go get your drink.

209
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,290
还哭着呢
Still crying, huh?

210
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,190
对  我们试尽了一切办法
Yeah. We've tried everything short

211
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,340
除了让他抽烟和喝咖啡
of a pack of smokes and a cup of coffee.

212
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,640
他尿布还是干干净净  没有粑粑
Still nothing but clean dipeys.

213
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,010
只剩下一个解释了
There's only one explanation for this.

214
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,810
马文自己学会了上厕所
Marvin has potty-trained himself.

215
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,870
他趁我们睡觉时去厕所
He sneaks into the bathroom while we're sleeping.

216
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,620
我去让巴尼看监控录像
I'll ask Barney to check the tapes.

217
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,720
巴尼在咱家厕所装了摄像头吗
Barney has cameras in our bathroom?!

218
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,490
你难道觉得他没有吗
Well, I mean, don't you think?

219
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,200
-你们好  -罗宾  真好
- Hey, guys. - Robin, good.

220
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,120
你来了  坏消息
You're here. Bad news.

221
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,200
你想要的那婚礼乐队5月25日已经被预定了
That wedding band you wanted is booked for May 25.

222
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,650
不是吧  你打算怎么办
Oh, no. What are you gonna do?

223
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,310
对了  我有个主意
Oh! Oh, hey! Here's an idea.

224
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,380
天啊  泰德  如果你提议请DJ
Oh, God, Ted, if you suggest a DJ...

225
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,120
才不是
Far from it.

226

我是想推荐一支乐队
I was going to suggest a band.

00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,800
名字叫库尔伙伴
A band called... Kool and the Gang.

你愿意让我
would you like for me

231
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,350
预定库尔伙伴在你的婚礼上表演吗
to get Kool and the Gang to play at your wedding?

232
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,970
应该  可以吧
Uh... I... yeah, guess so.

233
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,080

什么  你说什么
What? You're...? What are you say...?

239
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,730
这一切怎么可能办到
How... how is that even possible?

240
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,200
我告诉你怎么办到
I'll tell you how.

241
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,380
请个DJ
You hire a DJ.

小手一转  万事俱备

243
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,320

我爸第十五次给我发送好友申请了
the fifteenth time my dad has sent me a friend request.

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,460
我干脆点"接受"算了
I'm just gonna hit "Accept."

246
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,840
-千万不行  -别这样  罗宾
- No, no, no. - No, no, no, no, don't do it, Robin.

247
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,980
你不会想看见那扇门背后都藏着什么
You don't want to see what's behind that door.

248
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,150
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

249
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,360
他说的是
He's talking about

250

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,980
其中有十四个词都是"阴部"
And 14 of those words were "Vulva."

253
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,110
你会收到无数多的邀请
You're gonna get endless requests to play some game

254
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,800
邀你去玩黑帮游戏或者开心农场
that has something to do with gangsters and farming.

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,300
还有令人尴尬的高中时代
Never mind the embarrassing cheerleading photos

256
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,400
参加拉拉队的照片
from high school.

257
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,740
-我都跪求我我妈烧掉那些照片了  -罗宾
- Begged my mom to burn those. - Robin,

258
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,820
相信我  
trust me,

259
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,940
接受父母的好友申请  绝对没有好下场 
no good can come from accepting that friend request.

260
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,180
我大概是误导了你们大家
Yeah, I-I think I may have given you guys the wrong impression.

261
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,580
我爸他其实不是个坏人
Okay, my dad is actually not that bad of a guy.

262
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,320
下手吧  巴尼  果断扣下扳机
Do it, Barney. Squeeze that trigger.

263
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,950
人家不想做嘛
I don't want to do this.

264
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,830
你以为我当年想杀掉那只熊吗
Well, you think I wanted to kill that bear?

265
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,420
-我觉得你是想的  -你说得对
- Yeah, kind of. - Oh, yeah, you're right.

266
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,340
我下不了手
I can't do this.

267
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,870
你们在搞什么呢
What... what the hell is this?!

268
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,650
你爸是个疯子
Your dad is crazy!

269
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,080
他非逼我杀了棉花酱不可
He wanted me to kill Fluffernutter!

270
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,620
告诉你不要给他取名字
I told you not to give him a name!

271
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,770
我就取了
Well, I did!

272
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,790
我不但取了名  还帮他编了个来历
I gave him a name and a backstory!

273
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,890
他来自一个魔法小兔窝
He comes from a magical rabbit warren

274
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,750
一家老小住在老锈的拖拉机下
underneath the old rusty tractor.

275
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,740
他出生时先天不足  但却坚韧地活了下来
He was the runt of the litter, but he persevered.

276
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,530
-他...  -把枪给我  还给我
- He... - Oh, give me this. Give it to me!

277
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,550
爸  你就没有什么事要告诉我吗
Dad, is there, um, something you want to tell me?

278
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,060
80年代初期  我曾为中央情报局干过脏活
Well, in the early '80s, I did some wet work for the CIA.

279
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,910
爸  睡前故事我记忆犹新
Yes, Daddy, I remember the bedtime stories.

280
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,830
不  我指的是你的脸书
No, I'm, uh, talking about your Facebook page?

281
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,700
上面写着你结婚了
It says you're married.

282
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,560
那个
Well...

283
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,420
是的 卡罗尔和我当时在基拉戈
yes, uh, Carol and I were in Key Largo

284
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,900
老牌乡村摇滚歌星

285
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,900
参加吉米・布菲特的演唱会
at a performance of the recording artist James Buffett.

286
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,570
我们是铁杆的"鹦鹉头"
We're what are known as Parrotheads.

287
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,570
鹦鹉头是吉米・布菲特粉丝团的昵称

288
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,040
总而言之  一来二去
And, uh, well, one thing led to the other, and, uh...

289
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,120
我们就结婚了
we got married.

290
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,790
你不打算告诉我这件事吗
You didn't want to tell me about it?

291
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,120
我发脸书了啊  在脸书上宣布了
I Facebooked it... on Facebook.

292
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,710
好吧  知道吗  老爸
Okay, you know what, Dad?

293
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,860
既然你不想让我和你的私生活
Since you obviously have no interest in involving me

294
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,160
扯上关系  我就告诉你
in your personal life, I may as well tell you:

295
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,720
巴尼和我已经订婚了
Barney and I are already engaged.

296
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,180
她说得没错
That's right.

297
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,450
我是你的坚强后盾  罗宾
I'm behind you on this, Robin.

298
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,990
坚定地躲在你背后
Directly behind you.

299
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,380
总之  事情就是这样
Anyway, this is happening.

300
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,080
既然你不邀请我参加你的婚礼
And since I wasn't invited to your wedding,

301
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,020
你也别想来参加我的婚礼
you're not invited to mine.

302
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,900
再见吧
Good-bye.

303
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,770
不好了
Oh, no!

304
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,900
棉花酱尿了我一裤子
Fluffernutter peed all over my pants!

305
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,690
我给那个婚礼乐队的经纪人打了电话
So, I just called up that wedding band's road manager

306
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,060
要来了预定25号的人的电话
to get the number of the people who booked them for the 25th,

307
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,200
希望能塞点钱让他们取消预定
so I could bribe them into giving up the band.

308
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,910
你都做了什么  这实在太卑鄙了
You did what?! That is so dishonest!

309
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,060
不管接下来发生了什么  我们都一致同意
No matter what happens next, I think we can all agree,

310
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,780
你真是卑鄙无耻  莉莉
you're in the wrong here, Lily.

311
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,200
那就是你的电话  泰德
It's your number, Ted.

312
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,420
好吧  被你逮到了
All right, you got me!

313
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,890
我付了乐队一笔无法退还的定金
I put a non-refundable deposit on that band

314
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,970
好让巴尼和罗宾订不到他们
to keep Barney and Robin from booking them.

315
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,740
我本来可以成功骗过你们
And I would've gotten away with it

316
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,970
如果这计划不是那么愚蠢又那么昂贵的话
if it wasn't a really stupid and expensive plan.

317
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,560
老兄  你干嘛要这么做
Dude, why would you do that?

318
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,120
我不觉得这有什么重要的
I don't see what the big deal is.

319
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,260
重要的是罗宾值得拥有更好的选择
The big deal is Robin deserves better

320
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,640
而不是某支蹩脚又不靠谱的乐队
than some crappy, unreliable band!

321
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,180
乐队表面看起来是不错
Sure, bands seem cool

322
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,590
衣服帅  举手抬足都精心排练过
with their nice suits and their well-rehearsed moves,

323
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,280
可老实说  乐队总会让人失望
but let's be honest: bands let you down.

324
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,050
他们会撒谎  欺骗
They-They cheat, they deceive,

325
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,380
他们睡遍了纽约市的每个女人
and God knows they've slept with every girl in New York City.

326
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,740
我只是不敢相信
I just, I can't believe

327
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,160
罗宾要忍受嫁给...
Robin is going through with marrying...

328
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,050
请乐队这个想法
the idea of getting a band.

329
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,200
这句话没有一点语法错误哦
And that is, that's a perfectly normal way to phrase that.

330
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,570
好吧  泰德  去酒吧  马上走
Okay, Ted, bar. Now.

331
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,550
想得美
Nice try.

332
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,100
你就想把孩子丢给我
You're gonna stick me with that baby

333
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,350
然后去酒吧花五分钟
so that you guys can spend five minutes

334
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,680
解决他的爱情烦恼
sorting out his love life,

335
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,980
接下来的一小时就是喝得醉醺醺
followed by an hour of you getting drunk

336
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,870
大玩《无间道风云》的角色扮演
and pretending to be in The Departed.

337
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,690
好吧好吧  我很抱歉  莉莉
You know what? I'm sorry, Lily, okay?

338
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,120
可我只想知道一件事
But I just need to know:

339
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,510
-你是警察吗  -我不是警察
- Are you a cop? - I'm not a cop!

340
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,680
-你是警察吗  -我不是警察
- Are you a cop? - I'm not a cop!

341
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,940
我来处理这事
I got this.

342
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,540
泰德  你跟我  上楼
Ted, you, me, upstairs.

343
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,150
去楼顶  马上走
Roof. Now.

344
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,660
-哈  现在一月寒冬  -快走
- What? It's January. - Move!

345
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,940
废话就不说了
Let's cut the crap.

346
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,850
我俩都冻得要死
We're both freezing--

347
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,760
所以赶紧说完  我们就可以下楼了
just say it and we can go downstairs.

348
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,410
说什么啊
Say what?

349
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,550
说你有多不爽
Say how much you hate

350
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,910
罗宾要和巴尼结婚的事
that Robin and Barney are getting married.

351
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,920
什么  不  我
What? No. I...

352
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,690
我为他们感到高兴啊
I'm happy for them.

353
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,690
我还鼓励罗宾去追巴尼
I-I encouraged Robin to go after Barney.

354
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,520
我知道  因为你以为自己可以放手
I know-- because you thought you were okay letting her go.

355
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,350
但现在她真的要嫁人了
But now that she's really gone,

356
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,010
你大受打击
it hurts.

357
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,450
<i>孩子们  在那个时候</i>
<i>Kids, at that point in my life,</i>

358
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,930
<i>我的人生中已经受过不少次"打击"了</i>
<i>I'd been hurt quite a few times already.</i>

359
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,720
今天  我们要带上友情手链
Today, we're gonna braid friendship bracelets.

360
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,030
我深深地爱上了*
*I fell in love...

361
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,870
这件事其实很简单
There is a very simple explana... ah!

362
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,030
有一次我正在打网球
This one time, I was playing tennis, and...

363
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,270
对了  死尿斯比  还记得那次你在
Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied

364
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,130
湖边尿裤子的事吗
in your pants down by the lake?

365
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,940
真不敢相信
Unbelievable!

366
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,250
你爱我吗
Do you love me?

367
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,110
不爱
No.

368
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,810
<i>但当我看到那条短信</i>
<i>But when I saw that text message,</i>

369
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,870
<i>发现罗宾已经订婚时</i>
<i>and found out Robin was engaged,</i>

370
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,990
巴尼・斯丁森  罗宾和我订婚啦

371
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,920
感觉就像
it was like:

372
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,260
真不敢相信
Unbelievable!

373
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,020
不爱
No.

374
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,020
这些加起来  再乘以一百万倍
...times a million.

375
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,670
我真心为他们高兴
I am happy for them.

376
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,910
你只敢让自己这样说
Is all you'll let yourself say out loud,

377
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,660
因为只要你说了任何相反的话
because if you said anything to the contrary, well,

378
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,630
你就会变成
that would make you

379
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,480
这屋顶上最可怕的人
the most awful person on this rooftop.

380
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,770
我打算让你一吐为快
So, I'm gonna give you an out.

381
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,810
你打算怎么做
And how are you gonna do that?

382
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,860
我会说出更可怕的话
By saying something that is even more awful.

383
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,740
什么话
Like what?

384
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,920
有时候我会希望自己不是一个母亲
Sometimes I wish I wasn't a mom.

385
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,500
有时候我想收拾好行李
Sometimes I want to pack a bag

386
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,840
半夜悄悄离开  不再回来
and leave in the middle of the night and not come back.

387
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,970
罗宾不应该嫁给巴尼
Robin shouldn't be with Barney,

388
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,710
她应该嫁给我
she should be with me.

389
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,420
你说真的吗
You serious?

390
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,880
我不知道
I don't know.

391
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,830
我喜欢做母亲
I mean, I love being a mom, and...

392
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,470
我好爱好爱马文
I love Marvin so much.

393
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,980
但是
But...

394
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,670
你还记得
but do you remember

395
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,950
我想做艺术家的时候吗
when I wanted to be an artist?

396
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,540
艺术是我的人生意义
Art was my whole life.

397
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,230
而现在我已经好几个月
And-and now it's been months

398
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,710
没有拿起画笔了
since I've even picked up a brush.

399
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,820
我白天在幼儿园的工作就是照顾孩子
I-I spend the whole day taking care of kids at my job,

400
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,770
然后回到家  还是一样
and I come home and it's more of the same.

401
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,280
只是
It just...

402
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,720
从来没有休息的时候...
It never lets up, it...

403
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,760
真的真的好累  泰德
It's just really, really hard, Ted.

404
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,410
你有跟马修讲过你的感受吗
Have you talked to Marshall about how you feel?

405
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,600
你有跟罗宾讲过你的感受吗
Have you talked to Robin about how you feel?

406
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,690
说得好
Fair enough.

407
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,530
我想我们都必须接受人生的缺憾
I just think we have to accept our lots in life,

408
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,540
我必须做一位母亲
and I have to be a mom to a...

409
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,280
做一位漂亮可爱
a beautiful, wonderful--

410
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,300
有点小便秘的
if slightly constipated--

411
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,040
小男孩的母亲
little boy, and...

412
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,600
你必须让罗宾和巴尼在婚礼上请乐队
you have to let Robin and Barney get a band.

413
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,380
好吧  看看尿布里有什么
All right, let's see what's in this dipey.

414
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,640
什么也没有
Nothing.

415
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,670
绝对是什么也没有
Absolutely nothing.

416
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,330
你终于肯对你老爸笑了吗
Are you finally giving Daddy a smile?

417
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,880
上帝啊
Oh, God!

418
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,760
<i>不  当时喷的可不是彩条</i>
<i>And, no, it wasn't confetti.</i>

419
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,620
上帝啊
Oh! Oh, God!

420
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,240
求你了
Please!

421
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,980
好多的"彩条"啊
Holy confetti.

422
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,460
<i>那天晚上  罗宾同意</i>
<i>That night, Robin agreed</i>

423
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,560
<i>再见她父亲一次</i>
<i>to meet her dad one more time.</i>

424
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,610
你爸有话要说
Your Dad has something to say.

425
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,440
抱歉我没问你意见就结婚了
I'm sorry for getting married without consulting you.

426
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,150
这是我的错
It was wrong of me.

427
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,180
好了  罗宾
There. Now, Robin...

428
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,120
我知道只有道歉  是不能解决问题的
I know that no mere apology will fix this.

429
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,050
所以
And that is why

430
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,700
我已经要求卡罗尔和我离婚
I've asked Carol for a divorce.

431
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,720
什么
What?!

432
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,080
她的心都碎了  可以理解
She's heartbroken, understandably.

433
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,330
可能会自杀
Possibly suicidal.

434
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,310
我没有让他...
I did not tell him...

435
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,990
但如果付出这样的代价
But if that's the price

436
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,000
才能得到我女儿的爱
for my daughter's love...

437
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,850
我很乐意这个代价让卡罗尔来付
then I will gladly let Carol pay it.

438
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,710
这不是你想要的吗
Was that not what you wanted?

439
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,540
你想知道我要什么吗
You want to know what I want?

440
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,700
一个普通的爸爸  就是这样
A normal dad. That's all.

441
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,510
我要你同意这个金发男子
I want you to give this blond guy

442
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,140
娶我为妻
permission to marry me.

443
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,270
来参加我的婚礼  将我交给他
Come to the wedding, give me away,

444
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,160
笑着拍照  然后...
smile in the pictures, and then...

445
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,890
像普通父亲一样  和我跳舞
dance with me like a normal dad.

446
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,300
这个要求很过分吗
Is that too much to ask?

447
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,460
当然不会
"Of course not.

448
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,870
罗宾  我亲爱的女儿
Oh, Robin, my darling girl,

449
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,250
我当然会这样做
of course I'll do all stuff.

450
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,120
我爱你  我为你感到骄傲
I love you and I'm proud of you."

451
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,800
-他没这样说吧  -没
- He didn't say that? - No.

452
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,970
好吧  只跳一支舞
Fine. One dance--

453
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,360
舞曲是《天堂的芝士汉堡》
"Cheeseburger in Paradise."

454
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,180
必须得由卡罗尔演唱
And Carol's going to sing it.

455
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,540
我们婚礼见
Well, see you at the wedding.

456
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,140
但这是非常了不起的事
But it's kind of amazing.

457
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,540
他这辈子从没向我道过歉
I mean, he's never apologized to me in his life.

458
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,800
巴尼却让他这样做了
Barney made it happen.

459
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,350
他肯定是真的很爱我
He must really love me.

460
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,950
傻子才会不爱你
Well, he'd be crazy not to.

461
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,850
我真的为你们高兴
I'm really happy for you guys.

462
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,930
但我依然认为你们该请DJ
But I still think you should get a DJ.

463
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,510
有完没完  泰德
For God's sakes, Ted.

464
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,760
听我说
Hear me out.

465
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,630
<i>那晚我的理由强而有力</i>
<i>I made a pretty strong case that night,</i>

466
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,000
<i>但最后  她根本不想请DJ</i>
<i>but in the end, she didn't want a DJ.</i>

467
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,640
<i>她想要乐队</i>
<i>She wanted a band.</i>

468
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,440
<i>猜猜结果是什么 </i>
<i>And guess what happened.</i>

469
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,240
没错  乐队在最终一刻放他们鸽子了
That's right, the band cancelled at the last minute,

470
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,240
四个月后

471
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,370
我早说过他们会这样做
just like I said they would.

472
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,150
婚礼一周后举行  却连乐队都没有
The wedding is in a week, and no bands.

473
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,610
大家何时才能意识到  我从不会看走眼
When will people realize I always know what's what?

474
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,490
那你之前跟女同约会过一个月  怎么说
He says to the lesbian he dated for a month.

475
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,220
说得好
That's a fair point.

476
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,070
话说回来  你们不会恰好知道
Anyway, you guys wouldn't, uh, happen to know

477
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,790
有什么优秀的婚礼乐队
of any good wedding bands

478
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,990
可以临危受命吧
available at the last minute, would you?

479
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,900
泰德  你相信命运吗
Ted, do you believe in destiny?

480
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,800
看来你真是不认识我啊
You really don't know me, do you?

481
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,060
我们刚和我的前室友吃完早午餐
We just had brunch with my ex-roommate.

482
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,930
那个贝斯手吗
The bass player?

483
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,510
不  她不仅仅是贝斯手
No, she's not just a bass player.

484
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,440
她是大纽约三州最优秀的
She's a bass player in the best wedding band

485
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,550
婚礼乐队的贝斯手
in the tri-state area.

486
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,990
他们本来这周末有场演出
They had a gig lined up for this weekend,

487
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,440
但今早取消了
but it just fell through this morning.

488
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,190
我的朋友  你将是婚礼的救世主
You, my friend, are gonna save that wedding.

489
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,990
你们有认识什么DJ吗
Do you know any DJs?

490
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,290
哥们  拜托
Dude, come on.

491
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,090
别纠结了  兄弟  别纠结了
Let it go, bro. Just let it go.

492
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,000
好的  好的
All right, all right, all right.

493
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,890
我想
Well, I guess, uh...

494
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,980
碰到你们真是一件幸运的事
Guess it's a lucky thing I ran into you guys.

495
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,620
<i>孩子们  "幸运"完全不足以形容我有多幸运</i>
<i>And, kids, "Lucky" doesn't even begin to describe it.</i>

496
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,220
<i>因为如果巴尼和罗宾听了我的白痴建议</i>
<i>Because if Barney and Robin had taken my stupid advice</i>

497
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,110
<i>请了DJ</i>
<i>and hired a DJ...</i>

498
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,210
<i>我就永远不会碰到你们的母亲</i>
<i>...I never would have met your mother.</i>
