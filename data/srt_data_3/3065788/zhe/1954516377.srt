1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:05,730
我和我的哥哥们是历史上
最早的吸血鬼
REBEKAH: My brothers and I
are the first vampires in all of history.

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,873
是真祖家族
The Originals.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,271
三百年前，我们帮助建立了纽奥良
Three hundred years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,677
现在我们回来，发现这座城市战火纷飞
Now, we've returned
to find a city at war.

5
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,346
吸血鬼马赛尔领导着一支部队
对抗一群绝望的女巫
The vampire Marcel leads an army
against a coven of desperate witches.

6
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:26,589
我哥哥克劳斯与他们两者为敌
他渴望权力
My brother Klaus is playing against
both sides, hungry for power

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,422
希望保护怀着他孩子的狼人
and hoping to protect
the werewolf carrying his child.

8
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,689
但马赛尔有一个优势
But Marcel has an advantage.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,426
他在一个秘密武器的帮助下
俘掳了我们的哥哥以利亚
He holds our brother Elijah captive
with the aid of a secret weapon.

10
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,933
现在为了救回我深爱的哥哥
Now, in order to get back
the brother I love,

11
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,903
我别无选择
只能支援我无法信任的那个哥哥
I have no choice but to side
with the one I cannot trust.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,404
1359年8月
ELlJAH: August 1359.

13
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,774
我注意到兄弟姊妹之间的一个不同
I have noticed a
difference in my siblings.

14
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:57,280
我们之间的联系
在吸血鬼生活的压力之下更为紧张
Our bond strains beneath the
pressure of our life as vampires.

15
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,094
一旦被吸血鬼的魔性缠身
就会离人性日益渐远
Each day removes them further from
the humanity we once possessed.

16
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,229
我亲爱的妹妹蕾贝卡
变得越来越冷漠无情
My sweet sister Rebekah has grown
quite indifferent to brutality.

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,469
然而问题最大的还是我弟弟尼克劳斯
However, the true problem remains,
my brother Niklaus.

18
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,879
他依然用残忍掩饰着自己的孤独
He continues to hide
his loneliness with cruelty.

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,248
不过，我依然坚信，我身为他们的大哥
Still, I cling to the hope that I,
as their eldest brother,

20
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,114
可以将他们引上正途
can lead them
down the correct path.

21
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,782
受到家族力量指引的正途
A path charged with the power
of a family united.

22
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:40,458
如果我失败了
我们的家族只能在黑暗中沦陷
For if I fail, our family's legacy
will end in darkness.

23
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,693
我不敢相信你居然不等我
就自己处理了那些吸血鬼
I cannot believe you disposed
of those vampires without me.

24
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,862
你知道我最爱放火烧东西了
You know how I love
to set things on fire.

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,565
难道我该把他们留在前院任其腐烂吗？
Was I supposed to leave them
in the front yard to rot?

26
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,142
再说了，他们是我该负的责任
Besides, they were my responsibility.

27
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,179
他们攻击了怀着我孩子的
无助小孕妇
They attacked the helpless, pregnant girl
who's carrying my child.

28
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,648
你突然对怀着
你混合种孩子的狼人
Oh, I am so moved by your
newfound sense of fatherly duty

29
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,287
流露做父亲的责任感
真让我感动
towards the werewolf carrying
your hybrid bun in her oven.

30
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,683
狼女想知道计划是什么
The werewolf would like
to know what the plan is.

31
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,091
那要看你说的是什么计划，亲爱的
Well, that depends
what plan you mean, love.

32
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,753
是我统治全球的计划
My plan for global domination

33
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,866
还是蕾贝卡在残酷世界中
寻找真爱的计划
or Rebekah's plan to find love
in a cruel, cruel world.

34
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,771
营救以利亚的计划
The plan to rescue Elijah.

35
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,338
你知道，那个好哥哥
You know, the good brother,

36
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,941
被你从背后插入匕首
the one who is now
in the possession

37
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,600
现在落在你死敌手上的那个
of your mortal enemy after
you stabbed him in the back.

38
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,712
明确点说，是从前面
In the front,
if we're being specific.

39
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,508
你们俩说过会救他回来的
You two said that
you would get him back.

40
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,673
那么现在有计划吗？
So is there a plan, or what?

41
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,450
好吧
Okay.

42
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,388
首先，马赛尔不是我的死敌
Well, firstly,
Marcel is not my mortal enemy.

43
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:43,086
他是我的朋友
虽然他没意识到我正试图破坏
He's my friend, albeit one who is
unaware that I am trying to sabotage

44
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,959
他对整个超自然法语区的控制
his hold over the supernatural
community of the French Quarter,

45
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,531
但尽管如此，还是朋友
but a friend nonetheless.

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,865
第二点，我用匕首封住以利亚
是为了赢得马赛尔的信任
And secondly, I daggered Elijah
in order to gain Marcel's trust.

47
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,631
要是我早知道他会把我哥哥
If I had known he would
place my brother

48
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,207
交给一个特别暴躁的小女巫
in the hands of a particularly
nasty teenage witch,

49
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,902
我绝对会考虑做出略为不同的选择
I certainly would have weighed
my options a bit differently.

50
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,478
第三点，妹妹，请说
And thirdly, sister, please.

51
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,673
第三点，正如你所要求的
And thirdly, the plan,
as you have demanded,

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,751
计划就是尼克劳斯
直接向马赛尔要回以利亚
is for Niklaus to simply ask
Marcel for Elijah back.

53
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,149
这并不是全部的计划，对吧？
That's not the whole plan, is it?

54
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,350
拜托
Oh, please.

55
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,620
克劳斯作为一个兄弟也许并不称职
Klaus may be a miserable
excuse for a sibling,

56
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,627
但是没有比他更坏心的家伙了
but there is none
more diabolical.

57
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,900
这只是首选计划，亲爱的
That's only the plan "A," love.

58
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,865
但总有备用计划
There's always a plan "B."

59
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,529
备用计划是什么？
And what's plan "B"?

60
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,701
开战
War.

61
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:34,276
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：心乱如麻

62
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,288
警方表示目前没有线索…
主演：约瑟夫摩根
MAN (ON TV):
Police say they have no leads...

63
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,594
讨厌，我穿西装太帅了
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
Damn, I do look good in a suit.

64
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,865
约书亚罗萨，18岁
近日来到…
Joshua Rozza, 18,
had recently arrived....

65
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,560
我在码头的手下会主动站出来
主演：克莱儿荷特
My guy at the docks is gonna

66
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,799
做目击证人
come forward as an eyewitness,

67
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,908
声称他看到这两个喝醉的人
摔进了密西西比河
say he saw those two drunkenly
fall into the Mississippi.

68
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,168
他们会在河里打捞好几周
They'll be dredging for weeks.

69
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,905
没人会到这附近察看
主演：菲比托金
No one will come looking around here.

70
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,842
那很好
考虑到一个死在了…
That's good, considering
one is dead in a dumpster

71
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,245
郡太平间后面的垃圾箱里
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
behind the county morgue and

72
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,613
而另一个现在已经是吸血鬼了
the other one is a vampire now.

73
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,708
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达

74
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,547
还有什么吗？
Anything else?

75
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,222
让我来，亲爱的
Allow me, darling.

76
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,379
还有一件事
One thing.

77
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,583
我派了四个夜行者去调查…
I sent four Nightwalkers to look into

78
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,118
法语区出现的一个狼人
主演：莉雅派普斯
a werewolf sighting in the Quarter.

79
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,890
之后就再也没有他们的消息了
I haven't heard from them since.

80
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,397
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
(SlGHS)

81
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,992
那上周一共死了十个夜行者了
That makes ten dead Nightwalkers
in the last week.

82
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,804
你觉得是狼人又回到这里
想要制造麻烦吗？
You think the werewolves are back in
town trying to start some trouble?

83
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:36,373
听着，我知道你和克劳斯是朋友
Look. I know you
and Klaus are friends,

84
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,533
但事实是，自从真祖出现…
but the fact is,
since the Originals showed up--

85
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,771
好了吧，提艾里
你不会还在为之前我给你的
Oh, come now, Thierry.
You're not still upset about that little,

86
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,212
一小口有毒的狼人伤口而生气吧？
toxic werewolf bite
I gave you, are you?

87
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,715
我以为这事已经过去了
I thought we were at bygones.

88
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,376
我看你现在也给了他在你的地盘
自由行动的特权
I see you've given him free reign
of your compound now, too.

89
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,647
没错，就当作是我和我的家人
曾住在这里
Yes. Well, seeing as my family
and I lived here,

90
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:51,847
事实上是建立了这地方
built the place, in fact.

91
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,186
好了，别这样
你们俩都知道规矩
All right. Come on.
You both know the drill.

92
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,919
提艾里是我的人，亲信
Thierry is my guy, inner circle.

93
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,393
克劳斯是我的老友和父亲
Klaus is my old-time friend and sire.

94
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,191
还是这里的客人
He's also a guest here.

95
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,462
和平共处，行吗？
Peace, all right?

96
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,126
好的
All right.

97
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,731
你有何需要，兄弟？
What you need, my brother?

98
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,899
我想我妹妹蕾贝卡坚持让我要回以利亚
I'm afraid my sister Rebekah is
insisting I demand Elijah's return.

99
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,139
- 她对此非常生气
- 当然
-She's quite worked up about it.
-I'll say.

100
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,545
我们不是要让三个真祖在城里闲晃吧？
We're not gonna have three Originals
walking around town, are we?

101
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,049
我们有一半人都觉得
是他妹妹杀死了夜行者
Half our guys think the sister
killed the Nightwalkers.

102
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,516
那是指控吗？
Is that an accusation?

103
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,882
- 对
- 对一个真祖的指控？
-Yeah.
-Against an Original?

104
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,490
我刚才不是说了要和平共处吗？
What did I say about peace?

105
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,692
来，跟我走走
Come on. Walk with me.

106
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,129
你的亲信缺乏幽默感
制片：兰斯安德森
Your inner circle man
lacks a sense of humor.

107
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,105
他有点过度保护，但十分忠诚
He's a little overprotective,
but loyal to a fault.

108
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,036
在40年代，我救了他
I saved his life
back in the forties,

109
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,006
在退伍军人医院外
发现因战伤奄奄一息的他
found him dying of a war wound
outside a VA hospital.

110
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,510
他会为我杀人，为我而死
He'd kill for me and die for me.

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,342
还有，那小子小号真的吹得很棒
Plus, that boy can play the trumpet
like you would not believe.

112
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,876
也许看看今晚能不能让他在派对上…
制片：朗恩麦克劳德
Maybe I'll see if he can play

113
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:53,817
表演一下
a little tonight at the party.

114
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,678
你会来的，对吧？
You're coming, right?

115
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,948
我怎么能错过认识市议员的机会呢？
How can I miss my chance
to meet the city councilman

116
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,786
他可是接受了你的巨额慈善捐款呢？
as he accepts your gigantic
charitable donation?

117
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,428
他是个蠢蛋
但是为了某些社区服务
He's a schmuck,
but he lets us do our thing

118
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,064
他允许我们做自己的事
in exchange for certain
community services,

119
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,200
比如不把我们的尖牙对准当地人
Iike keeping our fangs
out of the locals.

120
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:13,299
听着，关于你哥哥
我很想帮你排忧解难
Listen. About your brother,
I would love to help you out,

121
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,839
但提艾里说得对
我的人都紧张不安
but Thierry is right.
My guys are on edge.

122
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,067
他们看到真祖家族回到这里
They see the Original
family moving in,

123
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,906
有吸血鬼死掉，这让他们非常紧张
vampires dying,
it makes them nervous.

124
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,441
如果我现在把以利亚还给你
If I hand Elijah back now,

125
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,139
也许会让他们产生错误印象
编剧：艾胥莉莱尔，巴特尼克森
it might give the wrong impression

126
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,912
搞不清楚这里到底是谁当家
about who's really in charge here.

127
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,644
你懂我的意思吗？
You know what I mean?

128
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,754
导演：克里斯葛端斯莫

129
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,620
你得理解我不得不问
You understand I had to ask.

130
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,656
尼克劳斯，看在老天的份上
Hey, Klaus, for the love
of Mary Magdalene,

131
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,851
一个简单的问题要问多久？
how long does it take
to ask a simple question?

132
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,256
比你想的要久多了
Much longer than you'd think,

133
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,957
因为回答正如预期中一样，不行
considering the answer was,
as expected, no.

134
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,659
马赛尔的手下提艾里很多疑
Marcel's man Thierry is suspicious.

135
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,736
他觉得是你杀死了十个夜行者
He thinks you killed
ten Nightwalkers.

136
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,532
胡扯，我只杀了八个
Well, that's a lie.
I only killed eight.

137
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,301
- 我应该让提艾里成为第九个吗？
- 马赛尔在假装友善
-Should I make Thierry the ninth?
-Marcel is playing friendly.

138
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,036
我们不能杀死他最爱的儿子
否则他会对付我们的
We can't kill the favorite son,
or he'll catch onto us.

139
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,271
- 那就开战吧
- 当然了
-So war it is, then.
-Indeed.

140
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,972
你知道怎么对付那个女巫吗？
Do you know what to do
with the witch?

141
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,913
- 我想我知道
- 很好
-I believe I do.
-Good.

142
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,021
你对付苏菲德弗罗
我来负责下一步
You manage Sophie Deveraux.
I'll take care of the next step.

143
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,490
我命令你放干他的血
I ordered you to drain
him of blood.

144
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,627
怎么这么久？
What's taking so long?

145
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,162
抱歉，我不是什么中世纪拷问专家
Sorry. I'm not, like,
medieval-torture-expert guy.

146
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,603
他到底对你做了什么？
What did he do to you, anyway?

147
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,068
和他做了什么无关
It's not about what he did.

148
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,003
而是我们搞定之后他会做什么
It's about what he's going
to do when we're done here,

149
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:27,545
也就是我想要他做什么都行
和你一样
which is whatever I want him to,
just like you.

150
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,314
比如，用这个刺穿他的身体
For example,
drive this through his torso.

151
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,149
真是太疯狂了
That is crazy.

152
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,493
我不想这么做，但却做了
I didn't want to do it,
but I did it, anyway.

153
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,255
这叫精神魅惑
It's called mind compulsion.

154
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,898
吸血鬼可以魅惑人类
Vampires can compel humans.

155
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,933
像我和我兄弟姊妹这样的真祖
可以魅惑吸血鬼
Originals, like my siblings and l,
can also compel vampires,

156
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,729
而没人能魅惑真祖
and no one can
compel Originals.

157
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,304
你懂了吗？很好
You following?
Good.

158
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,965
那就是像你这样的全新夜行者
That is how a brand-new Nightwalker
such as yourself

159
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,270
为何在这里在谁都没察觉的情况下
听从我的命令
is here doing my bidding
with no one the wiser.

160
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,040
但我从来没被放干血过
But I never had my guts
drained out of me.

161
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,116
是的，那个嘛，年轻的约书亚
是因为在你体内
Yes. That, young Joshua,
is because I got to you

162
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,185
没有一点马鞭草时
我就已经控制你了
before you had even a drop
of herbal vervain in your system.

163
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,515
马鞭草能阻止魅惑
You see, it prevents compulsion.

164
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,351
马赛尔让他所有的伙伴
Marcel has had his whole
crew taking it

165
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,358
在我回来后开始饮用马鞭草
那也就是为什么
since I returned to town,
and that is why

166
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,055
我们这位朋友需要放干血
our friend here needs
to be bled dry of it

167
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,826
这样我就能魅惑他听从我的命令了
so I can compel him
to follow my every command.

168
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,827
现在我哥哥被俘等待我的营牧
And with my brother currently
in captivity awaiting rescue,

169
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,098
我们就不能那么温柔了
不是吗？
we can't afford to be
gentle about it, can we?

170
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,637
真高兴你能来
Oh, so glad you could make it.

171
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,510
在你磨磨蹭蹭的时候
以利亚身插匕首躺着腐烂呢
Elijah only lies daggered and rotting
whilst you dillydally.

172
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,708
我能来你就该庆幸了
你想干嘛？
You're lucky I came at all.
What do you want?

173
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,877
昨晚海莉被马赛尔的人攻击了
Hayley was attacked
last night by Marcel's crew

174
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,648
因为有人告诉他
在法语区看到一个狼人
because somebody told him
there was a werewolf in the Quarter.

175
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,451
她只去过一个地方
She only made one stop.

176
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,720
在这里看到她的人出卖了她
看好，学着点
Whoever saw her here ratted her out.
Watch and learn.

177
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,668
- 你好，苏菲
- 你好，凯蒂
-Hey, Soph.
-Hey, Katie.

178
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,134
那里面都是金盏花
That's filled with marigold,

179
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,141
很能吸引异性
great for attracting
the opposite sex.

180
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,540
你戴一定很好看
It would look awesome on you.

181
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,811
我十分怀疑
I very seriously doubt that.

182
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,442
你还有其他的吗，比如…
Do you have any others,
one with, say,

183
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,247
我不知道，也许是附子草？
I don't know,
Wolfsbane, perhaps?

184
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,890
附子草？你要那个做什么？
Wolfsbane?
Why would you want that?

185
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,153
别跟我装傻
Please do not play dumb with me.

186
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,325
蕾贝卡
Rebekah!

187
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,490
我只卖了一些药草给那个狼人
仅此而已
I just sold the werewolf some herbs.
That's all.

188
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,158
你在骗我吗，凯蒂？
Are you lying to me, Katie?

189
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,133
我建议你诚实回答我的问题
I suggest you answer
my question honestly.

190
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,329
苏菲
Sophie...

191
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,531
回答她的问题，凯蒂，拜托
Just answer the question, Katie,
please.

192
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,875
是，我告诉别人了，但你不明白
Yes. I told someone,
but you don't understand.

193
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:39,707
我
I...

194
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,343
我爱他
I love him.

195
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,512
告诉我，你的吸血鬼情人是谁？
Then tell me, who is this
vampire Romeo of yours?

196
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,926
要我数到三吗？
Shall I count to three?

197
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,155
快点
我还要建立一整个部队呢
Be quick about it.
I have an army to build...

198
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,564
一个被魅惑的喽罗可成不了什么气候
(CELL PHONE VlBRATES)
...and one compelled minion
does not an army make.

199
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,637
- 怎么样？
- 叛徒的事你说对了
-Well?
-You were right about the traitor.

200
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,069
幸运的是，她只是个孩子
对我们一无所知
Luckily, she's just a kid
and she doesn't know anything

201
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,400
也不知道我们的目的
about us and what we're up to.

202
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,668
你想听听最能让你高兴的事吗？
Do you wanna hear
what's gonna please you the most?

203
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,833
请说吧
Do tell.

204
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,207
她爱着马赛尔的一个亲信
She's in love with someone
in Marcel's inner circle.

205
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,839
猜精是谁
Guess who it is.

206
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,152
得力助手，钟爱傻帽的那个？
Right-hand-man type,
favors silly caps?

207
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,719
回答正确加两分
Two points for you.

208
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,322
提艾里在和敌人交朋友呢
Thierry is fraternizing
with the enemy.

209
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,789
那就意味着他不知不觉成为了
我们整个计划的关键
That means he just unwittingly became
the key to our entire plan.

210
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,054
我说了这能让你高兴
I told you you'd be pleased.

211
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,358
在一个女巫和吸血鬼对峙的城市里
Oh, to be young and
in love in a city

212
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,400
血气方刚，坠入爱河
where witches and
vampires are at war.

213
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,001
真是太不幸了
How very tragic.

214
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,240
你疯了吗？
SOPHlE: Are you out of your mind?

215
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,850
- 不行
- 这很简单
-No way.
-It's very simple.

216
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,954
我们只要你施一个小小的
非常小的定位咒
We need you to perform
a teeny, tiny locator spell

217
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,350
帮我们找到我们的哥哥
to help us find our brother.

218
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,388
在这个城市使用魔法的女巫都会被抓
Witches who practice
magic in this town

219
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,549
然后会被杀
get caught, and they get killed.

220
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:05,094
对，关于这点
在我们交易时
Yes. About that,
it seems you left out

221
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,698
你似乎遗漏了一个重要细节
a crucial detail
when we made our deal.

222
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,095
马赛尔的秘密武器
女巫一使用魔法
Marcel's secret weapon,
the way he knows

223
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,533
他就能知道的方法
when a witch is using magic.

224
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,142
这么高的小女孩
很可爱，脾气不大好
Girl about "yay" high,
cute as a button, anger issues.

225
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,512
黛维娜？
Davina?

226
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,173
你在哪看到她的？
Where have you seen her?

227
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,443
不知道
那个小丫头抹去了我的记忆
I don't know.
The little brat erased my memory

228
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,349
就在她用她该死的意念
把我扔出窗外之后
right after she threw me out
a window with her bloody mind.

229
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,185
我来说重点吧
以利亚在黛维娜手上
Let me cut to the chase.
Davina has Elijah.

230
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,920
我想你们女巫
会想把黛维娜和马赛尔分开
You witches, I assume,
want to get Davina away from Marcel.

231
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,688
但我们不知道她在哪
We don't know where she is.

232
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,332
因此，我们需要魔法
Ergo, we need magic.

233
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,565
黛维娜会感觉到的
Davina would sense it.

234
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,900
当然，除非另一个女巫
比如，一个叛徒
Unless, of course, another witch,
say, a traitor to the cause,

235
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,042
比如凯蒂
Katie, for example,

236
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,076
同时在施一个更加强大的魔法
was to perform much more powerful
magic at the same time.

237
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,110
那就制造了一个烟雾弹
That would create a smokescreen

238
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,250
能够掩盖你的小小咒语不被黛维娜发现
concealing your very small spell
from Davina.

239
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,686
凯蒂不该死
Katie doesn't deserve to die.

240
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,345
苏菲德弗罗
Sophie Deveraux....

241
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,821
你不可能这么有原则
You're in no position
to be so principled.

242
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,090
没有战略上的损失是不能赢得战争的
You can't win a war without
a few strategic losses,

243
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,928
不管那损失会有多让人可惜
no matter how regrettable
they may be.

244
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,463
有多少次吸血鬼总是领先一步
How many times have the vampires
been one step ahead,

245
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,641
知道一些他们不该知道的事？
known something they shouldn't?

246
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:28,141
你的姊姊在大庭广众下被处决
就因为使用魔法
Your sister, executed in the
public square for practicing magic.

247
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,714
谁知道她会被抓？
Who knew she'd be caught?

248
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,113
她有没有试图逃走？
Did she even attempt to flee?

249
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,249
她藏在一艘货船的货舱里
就在船准备在
She was caught hiding
in a cargo hold of a freighter

250
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,186
密西西比河里起航时被抓了
before it set sail
down the Mississippi.

251
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:45,627
那么，请你告诉我
在马赛尔最重要的亲信中
And who, pray tell,
of Marcel's valued inner circle

252
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,891
谁管理他的码头生意？
manages his business
at the docks?

253
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,797
凯蒂的男朋友提艾里
Katie's boyfriend Thierry.

254
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,140
你说得对，他很不错
You're right.
He's good.

255
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,749
对吧？我叫他音乐人
Right?
"Music Man" I call him.

256
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,853
女士们都爱他，但是他心有所属了
Ladies love him,
but he's spoken for.

257
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,353
他总是和他美丽的小女巫在一起
He knocks around
with this pretty, little witch.

258
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,151
说他爱她，但是我不知道
Says he loves her, but I don't know.

259
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,728
你最重要的战士
在和你的敌人交往
Your brightest soldier
is fraternizing with your enemy,

260
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,389
你却不在意
and you don't care.

261
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,893
我当然在意
但提艾里是个成熟的男人了
Well, of course I care,
but Thierry is a grown man.

262
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,732
他会自己做决定
我也能得到一些重要内情
He makes his own choices,
and I get some good intel.

263
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,602
再说，他也不会做什么
危害我们事业的事
Besides, he's not gonna do anything
to jeopardize what we're doing here.

264
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,838
你瞧瞧
一个吸血鬼主持着一个奢华的慈善晚会
I mean, check this out, a vampire
hosting a ritzy charity event.

265
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,818
我们在这里是一个整体
没人会破坏
We have a community here.
No one is gonna mess that up.

266
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,487
不过呢…
Still....

267
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,918
你还是不会想让那些女巫太大胆妄为
You don't want the
witches to get too bold,

268
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,289
考虑到一个女巫说城里有狼人
given that a witch's tip
about a werewolf in town

269
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,658
导致了你的夜行者的失踪
Ied to the disappearance
of your Nightwalkers.

270
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,464
我确定你考虑过了
I'm sure you've considered
the possibility

271
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,193
这可能是个陷阱的可能性
that it could've been a trap.

272
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,233
也许我该给点暗示了
Maybe I'll send a little message.

273
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,378
提艾里
今晚带一队夜行者去女巫那
Thierry. Take a team of Nightwalkers
to the Cauldron tonight,

274
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,948
小小的骚扰一下
do a little rousting.

275
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,951
提艾里，下手狠一点
Oh, and, Thierry, make it nasty.

276
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,926
所以我就搬回来了
REBEKAH: And so then,
I moved back here

277
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,120
为了更亲近我的哥哥们
因为，说实话吧
to be closer to my brothers
because, let's face it,

278
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,889
家人最重要了，对吧，卡蜜儿？
family is important, right, Camille?

279
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,761
叫我卡蜜，我得改掉这个名牌
Cami.
I have to change this name tag.

280
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,095
喝醉的人都喜欢用法语跟我搭讪
Drunk guys keep hitting
on me in French.

281
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,171
你确定以前没来过这里吗？
你看起来很面熟
You sure you haven't been in here
before? Your face looks so familiar.

282
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,340
你一定是在外头见过我吧
You must have seen me
out and about.

283
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,273
你不是在和马赛尔杰拉德约会吗？
Aren't you dating Marcel Gerard?

284
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,082
他是我的朋友，算是吧
He's a pal of mine.
Sort of.

285
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,117
我听说他喜欢上了卢梭酒吧的金发酒保
I heard he had a crush on the
blonde bartender at Rousseau's.

286
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,382
称不上是约会
他在追求我，算是吧
I would hardly call it dating.
He's wooing me. Sort of.

287
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,787
我不知道
I don't know.

288
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,088
他很有魅力
这大概意味着我该赶快逃走
He's very charming, which probably
means I should run for the hills.

289
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,964
我自己现在有点处在分分合合的状态中
I'm kind of in an on-again,
off-again thing myself at the moment.

290
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,726
那种人最糟了，不是吗？
Those are the worst, aren't they?

291
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,133
那种你摆脱不了的人
就算你很清楚不适合
The ones you can't shake,
even though you know better?

292
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,738
你也一直都非常清楚
And you always know better?

293
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,534
我喜欢你，卡蜜
I like you, Cami.

294
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,142
大部分女孩都很爱发牢骚
Most girls have the unfortunate
tendency of being

295
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,835
嘲讽别人
whiny, little twits.

296
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,708
谢谢你咯
Thanks, I think.

297
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,975
我今晚要去参加那个慈善家举办的
Hey, I'm supposed to go
to this posh charity thing

298
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,144
奢华慈善晚会
thrown by this
philanthropist tonight.

299
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,620
他有点像盖茨比
弄了个很棒的派对
He's a bit of a Gatsby,
throws a mean party.

300
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,820
有兴趣吗？
Any interest?

301
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,528
妹妹
Little sister.

302
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,728
哥哥，我相信我确保了
Well, brother,
I believe I've made certain

303
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,964
马赛尔今晚会有点分心
Marcel will be properly
distracted tonight.

304
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,267
我能问吗？
Dare I ask?

305
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,603
只能说他的注意力不会在我们身上
Let's just say his attention
will not be on us.

306
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,941
我尽了我的绵薄之力
你做了什么来确保以利亚能平安回来？
I did my bit. What are you doing
to ensure Elijah's safe return?

307
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:53,312
现在呢，为保险起见
我在做些准备以防心软把事情办砸
Currently, I'm preparing insurance
against the tender-hearted.

308
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,474
什么意思？
Meaning?

309
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:58,453
我们需要为凯蒂找个合适的动机
在今晚施个强大的咒语
We need proper motivation for Katie
to cast a powerful spell tonight.

310
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,590
我在制作动机呢
I'm creating that motivation.

311
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,788
马赛尔下令骚扰女巫
Marcel has ordered
a rousting of the witches.

312
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:17,367
我就反过来安排事情悲剧地出错
I, in turn, have arranged for things
to go tragically wrong.

313
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,610
明白要怎么做了吗？
You understand what you're to do?

314
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,639
很好
Good.

315
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,022
嘿
Hey.

316
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,655
外面发生什么事了？
What's happening out there?

317
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,492
是克劳斯
Oh, it's Klaus.

318
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,293
他让马赛尔觉得女巫
He's convinced Marcel
that the witches

319
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,402
在计划采取行动对付他
are planning to make
a move against him.

320
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,969
马赛尔想让我们来给个暗示
Marcel wants us to send a message.

321
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,400
不要
Don't!

322
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,268
如果他觉得我有所偏袒
And if he thought
I was playing favorites

323
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,965
就因为我爱上了一个女巫…
because I'm in love with a witch....

324
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,038
再说一遍
Say that again.

325
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,480
我爱你，凯蒂
一切都会没事的
I love you, Katie,
and all this is gonna be okay.

326
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,640
我保证
I promise.

327
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,687
马赛尔也许不在意
提艾里那些你侬我侬
KLAUS: Marcel may not be concerned with
Thierry's romantic entanglements....

328
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,192
那边我已经搞定了
I already got that one.

329
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,861
但还是有些罪过对他而官
没那么容易原谅
But there are other crimes which
he'll be less inclined to forgive.

330
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,869
放开她，滚开
Leave her alone!
Get off!

331
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,844
比如，杀死一个吸血鬼
Killing a vampire, for example.

332
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,018
那就不可原谅了
That would be unforgivable.

333
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:48,999
如果凯蒂想让她的爱人
免于马赛尔的惩罚
If Katie hopes to save her one true love
from Marcel's punishment...

334
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:54,135
而想要救他就必须使用魔法
Well, a rescue mission like that will
require something positively magical.

335
00:17:54,907 --> 00:18:00,641
不过话说回来
除了爱情还有什么值得付出生命呢？
But then what's worth dying for
if not love?

336
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,619
（化妆舞会）
? (ROCK MUSlC PLAYS) ?

337
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,186
不得不说，这个布景
很适合今晚的活动
This certainly is a fitting backdrop
for tonight's events, I must say.

338
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,572
她来这里做什么？
What's she doing here?

339
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,869
要让马赛尔分心
还有什么办法比得上
What better way to distract Marcel
than to put his very human,

340
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,275
让他的人类新女友
置身在一个满是吸血鬼的地方呢？
new girl in a room
chock full of vampires?

341
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,483
你好，亲爱的，你好美
Hello, darling.
You look precious.

342
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,992
这个派对真荒诞
但我觉得我会慢慢喜欢上它
This party is ridiculous, and I think
I could pay tuition with this dress.

343
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,658
他就是那个恶名昭彰
令人捉摸不定的家伙？
Is he the infamous
on-again, off-again?

344
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,799
事实上，我是她哥哥
我妹妹说得没错
He's the brother, actually,
and my sister is right.

345
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,838
你的确很美
You do look stunning.

346
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,433
你这身行头也很不错
You clean up pretty well yourself.

347
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,943
别被唬弄了，亲爱的
我可是只披着羊皮的狼
Well, don't be fooled, love.
I'm the devil in disguise.

348
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,709
你们聊吧，我要来点酒
You two chitchat.
I need booze.

349
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,513
- 跳舞吗？
- 好的
-Shall we?
-Okay.

350
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,417
苏格兰威士忌，谢谢
Scotch, please.

351
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,627
你邀请她来是想让自己招人喜欢吗？
You trying to be cute
inviting her here?

352
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,238
我觉得她很迷人
I think she's darling.

353
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,241
我看得出你爱的就是她那颗纯洁的心
I can tell you fancy her pure heart.

354
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,072
或许哪天我会亲手喂给你
Perhaps I'll feed it to you.

355
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,476
你吃醋的样子真好看，蕾贝卡
Jealousy looks good on you, Bekah.

356
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,219
蕾贝卡说的那个人
The guy of hers Rebekah
was talking about.

357
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,857
我觉得应该就是马赛尔
I'm sensing that would be Marcel.

358
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,052
要我就不担心
I wouldn't worry about it.

359
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,390
都是陈年旧事了
Ancient history.

360
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,392
我开始觉得你妹妹是个贱人
I'm beginning to think your
sister is a bit of a bitch.

361
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,069
这个词好像还是她发明的
It's as though she invented the term.

362
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,106
听着
Listen.

363
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,803
抱歉，失陪一下
Pardon me for a moment.

364
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,574
卡蜜
Cami.

365
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,287
派对弄得很不错
Hey, killer party.

366
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,288
这是应付公事的
我本来是要邀请你的…
Oh, it's more of a work thing.
I would've invited you--

367
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,417
没事，不过是约过一次会而已
不需要解释什么
Oh, no. We've been on one date.
No explanation necessary.

368
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,086
你做你的事，我会自己找乐子
You do your thing.
I'll entertain myself.

369
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,928
什么，弃你不顾？
看着你自己玩？
What, leave you alone,
looking the way you do?

370
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,867
想都别想
Hell with that.

371
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,904
你不该到这里来的
You're not supposed to be out here.

372
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,101
你是谁？
Who are you?

373
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,576
抱歉，我不是故意要吓你
我是莎宾，我们见过
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm Sabine. We met.

374
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,681
我是苏菲的朋友
I'm one of Sophie's friends.

375
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,612
你是这里的女巫
You're one of the witches.

376
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,879
苏菲要我在大家
都出去玩的时候过来陪你
Sophie just asked me to come keep
you company while everyone is out.

377
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,084
他是被你吸引来的
You know, it's drawn to you.

378
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,655
你肚里的孩子
一半吸血鬼，一半狼人
The child you're carrying
is part vampire, part werewolf.

379
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,764
你和克劳斯创造了一个很特别的东西
You and Klaus
made something special.

380
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,491
你说话口气像以利亚
You sound like Elijah.

381
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,128
他觉得这个孩子会为我们营造
He thinks this baby
is gonna make us

382
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,367
一个欢乐的大家庭，但他现在却不在了
one big, happy family,
but now he's gone,

383
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:30,004
还有…
我甚至不知道它究竟…
and I don't even know what...

384
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,684
是什么
...it is.

385
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,284
听着，如果你想的话我可以帮你
You know, I can do something
about that if you want.

386
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,320
我是说，帮你看看是男是女
I mean, find out if
it's a boy or girl.

387
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,685
我还以为你们不能在这里使用巫术
I thought you couldn't do
witchy stuff around here.

388
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,351
这不是巫术，只是一个老把戏
我外婆教我的
It's not magic, just an old trick
my grandmother taught me.

389
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,230
来吧
你一定有点好奇
Come on.
You have to be a little curious.

390
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,781
我记得你说你是做社区工作的
I thought you said you
were in community work.

391
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,918
社区募款
Community fundraising.

392
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,916
办派对，让人们打开钱包捐款
Throw a party,
folks open their wallets.

393
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,349
我就是干这个的
It's kind of my thing.

394
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,355
我大概就是你们说的必要之恶吧
Guess I'm what you call
a necessary evil.

395
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,085
那蕾贝卡呢，她是你的捐款人之一吗？
And Rebekah,
she's one of your donors?

396
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,557
她是个老朋友
She's an old flame.

397
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,663
不可能有多老吧
她看起来比我年轻
Can't be that old.
She looks younger than me.

398
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,461
你会大吃一惊的
我遇见她的时候还是个孩子
You'd be surprised.
I was a kid when I met her.

399
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,729
别再说她了
Enough about her.

400
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,534
我只想跟你在一起
I just want to be
right here with you.

401
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:35,137
你还真是个令人发指的小恶魔
是不是？
You really are a hideously evil
little thing, aren't you?

402
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:39,409
胡说，他们两个是绝配
Nonsense.
They're perfect for each other.

403
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,519
你想让马赛尔分心，这不就成了
You wanted Marcel distracted.
Voila.

404
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,104
我该走了
My cue to leave.

405
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,023
失陪
Excuse me.

406
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,266
你到底干了什么？
What the hell did you do?

407
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,307
别在这说，换个地方说
Not here.
No, not here.

408
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,344
我知道你觉得他是个怪物
I know you think he's a monster.

409
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,453
我怎么想不重要
It doesn't matter what I think.

410
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,646
提艾里又杀了一个吸血鬼
Thierry killed another vampire.

411
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,519
他打破了马赛尔最重大的规矩
He broke Marcel's biggest rule.

412
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,183
你再也见不到他了
You'll never see him again.

413
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,623
除非我们做点什么
Unless we do something.

414
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,834
我们？
"We"?

415
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,096
我想救我的族人
I want to save our people.

416
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,899
你想救提艾里吗？
You want to save Thierry?

417
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,409
要达到这两个目的只有一个方法
There's only one way we can do both.

418
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,282
准备好了吗？
You ready?

419
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,349
马赛尔，要出事了
Marcel.
Something is coming.

420
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:23,174
魔法
Magic.

421
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:26,436
- 我想听听你怎么说
- 马赛尔，别这样
-I want to hear your side of it.
-Marcel, come on.

422
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:28,241
你的版本，说
Your version. Go.

423
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:30,874
我们当时正在扔锅炉
We were tossing the Cauldron.

424
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:34,988
那个人，某个夜行者
无缘无故袭击了凯蒂
This guy, some Nightwalker,
he attacked Katie for no reason.

425
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:36,453
他叫麦克斯，是我转变的
His name was Max.
I turned him.

426
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:39,058
他并不需要什么理由
As far as reasons go,
he doesn't need one.

427
00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:42,025
她是女巫，而他是吸血鬼
She was a witch.
He was a vampire.

428
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:43,595
现在他死了
Now, he's dead.

429
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:50,370
我不是有意的
I didn't mean for it to happen.

430
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:52,870
你打破了我最重要的规矩
You broke my most important rule.

431
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:57,109
该死，小提
我们做朋友多久了？70年？
Damn it, T. How long we been friends?
Seventy years?

432
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,539
我把你变成了不死之身
I turned you into something
that would never die.

433
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:04,583
我赐予了你天赋
I gave you a gift.

434
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:10,054
我对你也一直很忠诚
现在依然是
And I have been loyal to you
all this time, and I still am.

435
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:12,351
我依然是你的朋友，马赛尔
I'm still your friend, Marcel.

436
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:16,662
我发誓这没有变
I swear, that hasn't changed.

437
00:27:28,443 --> 00:27:29,967
你是对的，亲爱的
Are you alright, love?

438
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:33,175
他脾气很大，不是吗？
He's got a temper, doesn't he?

439
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:39,719
或许现在我该记起我早就知道会这样的
I guess this is the moment
I remember I know better.

440
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:04,174
这是我们在他女人那里找到的
We found this at his girl's place.

441
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:13,977
依然是我的朋友，是吗？
Still my friend, huh?

442
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:15,853
真可笑
That's funny,

443
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,288
因为你的小女巫手里
because it looks to me
like that little witch of yours

444
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:19,417
有我一直锁起来的咒语
got her hands on a spell
that I keep locked away.

445
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:21,653
- 马赛尔，我从没见过这个
- 闭嘴
-Marcel, I have never seen that.
-Shut up.

446
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:24,263
我看你手上依旧戴着
我给你的日光戒指
I see on your hand, you still have
the daylight ring I gave you.

447
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:27,060
你还要制作戒指的秘方干什么？
So, what would you need with
the recipe for making new ones?

448
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:28,702
除非你想和凯蒂远走高飞
Unless maybe you and Katie
were gonna go off

449
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:30,270
自己另立门户？
and start a little kingdom
of your own?

450
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:32,966
- 不是的，马赛尔
- 让我教教你什么是朋友
-Marcel, no.
-Here's a lesson in friendship.

451
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:35,439
朋友不会欺骗我，违反我的规矩
Friends don't lie to me,
they don't break my rules,

452
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,942
更不会偷走属于我的东西
and they do not steal what is mine.

453
00:28:52,393 --> 00:28:54,759
监于其谋杀同伴的罪行
For the crime of murdering
one of his own,

454
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:58,592
我宣判将提艾里范舒囚禁于花园一百年
I sentence Thierry Vanchure
to 100 years in the garden.

455
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:04,801
好戏上演了
And it begins.

456
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:21,920
你的决定是正确的
You're doing the right thing.

457
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:24,023
这是唯一能找到以利亚的方式
It's the only way to find Elijah.

458
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:27,688
我只是做我该做的
I'm doing what I have to do.

459
00:30:00,862 --> 00:30:03,194
- 凯蒂，不要
- 出现得正是时候
-Katie, no!
-Like clockwork.

460
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:28,616
快点
Hurry.

461
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:32,819
不！
No!

462
00:30:42,403 --> 00:30:44,098
你是来救你男人的吧
You're here to save your man.

463
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,601
放马过来吧，小丫头
Well, come on, little girl.

464
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,438
去死吧，你这个混蚤
Die, you son of a bitch.

465
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,544
不要，凯蒂
不要
No! Katie! Don't!

466
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:06,592
事情不对劲
凯蒂的魔法停止了
SOPHlE: Something is wrong.
Katie's magic stopped.

467
00:31:09,063 --> 00:31:10,997
- 我可以继续
- 不行，她会察觉的
-I can keep going.
-You can't. She'll sense it.

468
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:13,360
不，我能找到黛维娜
再给我一点时间
No. I can find Davina.
I just need another moment.

469
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:17,136
你或许可以为了救回你的女巫奋不顾身
You may be willing to die
to get your witch back,

470
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:19,136
但海莉和孩子会跟着你送死
but Hayley and the baby
will die with you.

471
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:22,276
以利亚永远不会原谅我们
救回他也会变得毫无意义
Elijah will never forgive us,
and rescuing him will be for nothing.

472
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:27,437
结束了
我们失败了
It's over.
We failed.

473
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:33,378
不，凯蒂，不不不
No. Katie.
No, no, no.

474
00:31:36,357 --> 00:31:37,551
不
No.

475
00:31:58,312 --> 00:31:59,836
告诉我
Just tell me this.

476
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:03,616
她值得吗？
Was she worth it?

477
00:32:05,353 --> 00:32:06,945
我爱她
I loved her.

478
00:32:15,863 --> 00:32:18,991
把他封起来
让他在这腐烂
Seal him up and let him rot.

479
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:51,988
卡蜜看见了多少？
How much did Cami see?

480
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,230
她只见到了一场争执，兄弟
She just saw an argument, mate.

481
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:57,561
没什么你应付不来的
It's nothing you can't fix.

482
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:03,704
你真的很喜欢她，是吗？
You really like her, don't you?

483
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:06,975
我喜欢她没有被牵扯进这一切的样子
I like that she's not
a part of any of this.

484
00:33:09,283 --> 00:33:11,945
有时用人类的角度看世界
也是一件好事
Sometimes it's good to see the
world the way the humans do.

485
00:33:16,857 --> 00:33:19,155
提艾里的事我很遗憾
I am sorry about Thierry,
you know?

486
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:22,962
看得出他是你很好的朋友
I can tell he was a good friend.

487
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:26,028
是我一手打造了他
I made him what he was.

488
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,690
显然我不该信任他
Obviously, my trust was misplaced.

489
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:29,495
这也不会好过一点
Doesn't make it easier.

490
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:39,644
你今晚救了我，我欠你份人情
You saved me tonight.
I guess I owe you one.

491
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:42,876
你想要回你哥哥
You asked for your brother back.

492
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:45,779
这是我唯一能为你做的了
Seems like the least I can do.

493
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:14,547
- 卡蜜…
- 想都别想
-Cami--
-Don't even try it.

494
00:34:14,715 --> 00:34:15,739
我知道你为什么来
I get the bro code.

495
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,783
你是来为你朋友说好话的
You're here to smooth things over
for your friend.

496
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:20,079
你人很好，但…
It's very nice of you, but--

497
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:21,551
但你曾被伤害过
But you've been hurt before,

498
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:23,952
你不敢再轻易尝试
and you aren't taking
any more chances.

499
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,558
差不多是这样
Something like that.

500
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:30,288
今晚我看到的他
不是我想像中的他
The guy I saw tonight?
Not the guy I thought he was.

501
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:34,594
如果他能这样说变脸就变脸
And if he can turn
on a dime like that....

502
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:37,067
听起来不止是普通的心碎
Sounds like more than
just a broken heart.

503
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:41,033
看来有人辜负了你的信任
Someone broke your trust.

504
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:47,912
卡蜜儿，勇敢的酒保
Camille, the brave bartender.

505
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:01,126
对不起
I'm sorry.

506
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,931
但我希望你能再给马赛尔一次机会
But I need you to give
Marcel another chance.

507
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:11,961
看来是我会错意了
Wow.
I totally misread that.

508
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:16,803
不，你看得很准
但我们都有自己的角色要扮演
No. You read it quite well,
but we all have our roles to play.

509
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:23,214
你去了马赛尔家，与他共舞
You went to Marcel's.
You danced.

510
00:35:23,384 --> 00:35:26,410
你为他与朋友争执感到难过
You feel badly that he
had a row with his friend,

511
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:31,217
但除此以外，你只记得
其他一切都很完美
but otherwise, all you remember
is that it was perfect.

512
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:47,039
今晚真是彻底的失败
Well, tonight was an epic failure.

513
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,971
恰恰相反，妹妹
On the contrary, sister.

514
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:51,407
今晚成功极了
Tonight was a masterpiece.

515
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:54,810
你疯了吗？
凯蒂在苏菲完成咒语前死了
Are you mad? Katie died before
Sophie could complete the spell.

516
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:57,883
我很清楚，是我杀了凯蒂
I'm well aware.
I killed Katie.

517
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:00,811
你干了什么？
You what?

518
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:03,047
我们寻死的小女巫一定是
There's no way our
little suicide witch

519
00:36:03,224 --> 00:36:06,591
打算跟马赛尔同归于尽
wasn't gonna try and take out
Marcel with her.

520
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,127
我救了他的命，正因如此
I saved his life,
and in doing so,

521
00:36:10,297 --> 00:36:13,960
他已经在我的控制之中了
I now have him exactly
where I want him.

522
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:16,364
苏菲信任你
Sophie trusted you.

523
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:19,973
我信任你，尽管违背直觉
I trusted you against
all my better instincts.

524
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,869
醒醒吧，蕾贝卡
Wake up, Rebekah.

525
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:26,141
女巫们只为她们自己谋划
The witches are on no one's side
but their own.

526
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:29,214
她们只想得到那个叫黛维娜的女孩
This girl, Davina,
that's all they want,

527
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:32,477
当她们拥有了她，你觉得会怎样？
休战吗？
and when they have her, what do
you think happens then, a truce?

528
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:37,313
当然不是
她们会用黛维娜的力量对付我们所有人
Of course not. They will use
Davina's power against all of us.

529
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:40,187
即便你说得对，但计划是找到以利亚
Even if you're right,
the plan was to find Elijah,

530
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:42,022
而你让我们失望了
and you failed us.

531
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,925
你总是对我缺乏信心
You always did lack faith.

532
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:48,528
由于保护马赛尔，他更信任我了
By protecting Marcel,
I've cemented his trust,

533
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:52,103
信任到他同意把以利亚还给我们
so much so that he's agreed
to return Elijah to us.

534
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:57,136
时机一到
等他告诉了我
And when the time is right,
when he has told me everything

535
00:36:57,311 --> 00:37:01,611
黛维娜的所有事
我要亲自掌控她
I need to know about Davina,
I will have her for myself.

536
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:08,882
我毫不怀疑你能心想事成，尼克
I have all the faith in the world
that you'll get what you want, Nik.

537
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:13,550
你一向如此
不管我们其他人要付出多少代价
You always do,
no matter what it costs the rest of us.

538
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:18,956
你让我恶心
You disgust me.

539
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:42,146
你没事吧？我担心死了
Are you okay?
I was so worried.

540
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:44,450
谢谢
我感觉到了你所做的一切
Thank you.
Whatever you did, I felt it.

541
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:45,990
你帮助了我
You helped me.

542
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,752
是那些老家伙，对吧？
It was the old ones, wasn't it?

543
00:37:47,928 --> 00:37:50,556
其实今晚是克劳斯救了我
Actually, Klaus is the one
that saved me tonight.

544
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:51,993
我要纠正错误
I'm gonna make things right,

545
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,134
首先就是把他哥哥还给他
starting off by giving
him his brother back.

546
00:37:54,435 --> 00:37:55,527
不行
No.

547
00:37:57,104 --> 00:37:59,368
- 什么？黛维娜…
- 不行
-What? Davina--
-No.

548
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:03,402
你说过那些老家伙很危险
You said the old ones
were dangerous.

549
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:09,113
在知道怎么杀死他们之前我不会归还他
I won't give him back
until I know how to kill them.

550
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:32,670
我觉得你可能想知道
以利亚要回来了
I thought you might like to know,
Elijah is returning to us.

551
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:37,470
恭喜
Congratulations.

552
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:40,545
我想作恶多端也是有好处的
I guess being diabolical
has its perks.

553
00:38:45,586 --> 00:38:48,817
你不了解他，但你却想念他
You hardly know him,
and yet you miss him.

554
00:38:51,925 --> 00:38:54,291
我的哥哥为何
What is it about my brother
that always inspires

555
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:56,326
总能引人敬佩？
such instant admiration?

556
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,928
他对我很好
He was kind to me.

557
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:07,330
有时我会怀疑
我的家族能否得到救赎
ELlJAH:
There are moments when I doubt
my family is capable of redemption.

558

但每当我想放弃时
ELlJAH: Yet each time that I am
tempted to surrender,

561

总会看到一丝善良
支援我坚持我的信念

that allows me to believe.

是不会带来好结果的

等什么？
Wait what?
