1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,863
No, seriously, I think I've finally figured out
my problem with women.

2
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:10,631
The capybara is the largest member
of the rodent family.

3
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:13,002
What does that have to do
with me and women?

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,041
Nothing, it was a desperate attempt...

5
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:18,204
...to introduce
an alternate topic of conversation.

6
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:20,612
My problem
is I don't project confidence.

7
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:24,276
So I decided that the next time I meet
a woman I think is attractive...

8
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,786
...rather than holding back
and being cautious...

9
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:28,891
...I'll assume
the mantle of self-assurance.

10
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:31,524
Oh, yeah? What does that look like?

11
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,321
Hi.

12
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,664
I'm Leonard.

13
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:40,993
And you are beautiful.

14
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:44,698
You pop, sparkle and buzz electric.

15
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:50,643
I'm gonna pick you up at 8,
show you a night you will never forget.

16
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:53,478
Where are we going?

17
00:00:57,254 --> 00:01:01,020
Good news, I made it onto the team
for the new Defense Department...

18
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:04,490
...laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
- Excuse me.

19
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,994
If we're changing topics, I believe
I have first dibs with capybara...

20
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:11,032
...a rodent the size of a baby hippo.

21
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,560
- Congratulations, Howard.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:16,932
Listen,
I have to get a security clearance...

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,665
...so you guys might be hearing
from the FBI.

24
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:22,437
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't want to speak to the FBI.

25
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:26,511
- Why not?
- I'm brown and I talk funny.

26
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,947
They're just doing
a background check on me.

27
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:33,452
It doesn't matter, they'll find a reason to
give me a one-way ticket to Gandhiville.

28
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:36,023
By the way, when I say that,
it's not offensive.

29
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:38,021
Don't be ridiculous, Raj.

30
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:40,026
- You're here legally.
- Nobody cares.

31
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:42,825
You know how long it's been
since I got through airport security...

32
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,126
...without being given a colonoscopy?

33
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:49,534
You know, I try very hard to make our
lunch hours educational and informative.

34
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:54,405
But your insistence on talking about
your own lives stymies me at every turn.

35
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:57,208
Fine, Sheldon,
tell us about your giant rodents.

36
00:01:57,381 --> 00:02:01,374
No. You squandered your time with me
and the moment has now passed.

37
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,041
Feast on your disappointment...

38
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,621
...much as the capybara
feasts on its own waste.

39
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:39,685
Oh, Bella, don't you see?

40
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:43,257
Edward's only pushing you away
because he loves you.

41
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,085
Coming.

42
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,125
Dr. Koothrappali?

43
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:58,005
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.
May I come in?

44
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,777
I'd like to talk to you
about Howard Wolowitz.

45
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:05,915
Ah, thank you.

46
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:09,210
All right. Well, how long have you known
Mr. Wolowitz?

47
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:34,175
- Rum cake?
- No, thanks.

48
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:36,311
Now, about Mr. Wolowitz.

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,742
Seven years.

50
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:39,404
I see.

51
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:44,610
I'm in this country legally, you know.

52
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,153
I'm sure you are.

53
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:47,551
Now, to your knowledge...

54
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:49,817
...has Mr. Wolowitz
ever committed a crime?

55
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,084
Of course not.

56
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,592
I'm here on an H1 B visa...

57
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:56,163
...which means I can't be associated
with crime or criminal activity...

58
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,561
...and I'm not.

59
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:58,792
Good.

60
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,961
To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz
have any foreign contacts?

61
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:04,072
No, just me.

62
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:05,831
Oh, there it is.

63
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,840
Here comes the cavity search.

64
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,646
- Excuse me?
- Please don't send me back to India.

65
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:14,306
It's so crowded. It's like the whole
country is one endless Comic-Con...

66
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:19,217
...except everybody's wearing
Indian Guy.

67
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:21,356
- Dr. Koothrappali...
- I love this country.

68
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:25,527
The baseball, the freedom,
the rampant morbid obesity.

69
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,460
From California to the New York island,
I'm a real Yankee Doodle boy.

70
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,964
Dr. Koothrappali, please.

71
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,465
My country 'tis of thee

72
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:36,504
Da-da-da liberty

73
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,470
It's really great

74
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,502
So when Howard said
the FBI would be contacting me...

75
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,375
...I was expecting Mulder.

76
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:48,750
Glad to see I got Scully, ha, ha.

77
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:51,250
- Who?
- Mulder and Scully.

78
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,815
X-Files.

79
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:56,417
"The truth is out there." Never mind.

80
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:59,494
Uh, so, what would you like to know?

81
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,163
You work with Mr. Wolowitz
here at the university, correct?

82
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,563
Yes. Of course,
we're in different departments.

83
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:08,533
He's an engineer
and I'm an experimental physicist.

84
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:10,730
You know, one of those guys
who examines...

85
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:13,000
...the building blocks of creation
and says:

86
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,406
"Hello, maker of the universe.

87
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,176
I see what you did there.

88
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:19,975
Good one."

89
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:21,411
Right.

90
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:24,918
Now, how would you characterize
your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?

91
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:27,086
Good.

92
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:29,718
It's a good relationship.

93
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:32,919
Of course, most of my relationships
are good, you know.

94
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:36,257
Probably because I exude confidence.

95
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,298
People are drawn to that, you know?

96
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:39,559
Mm.

97
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,928
Confidence, not exuding.

98
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,935
Do you know of any groups
Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?

99
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,601
You are beautiful, you know that?

100
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:54,307
You pop, sparkle and buzz electric.

101
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,614
I'm gonna pick you up at 8.

102
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:02,019
Show you a night
you will never forget.

103
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,953
Sounds great.

104
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:06,218
Really?

105
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,022
Yeah.

106
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:11,725
Can my 6'2" Navy SEAL husband
come with us?

107
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:17,833
Is that...? Oh, my, I didn't see the ring
with my glasses off so...

108
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,474
Look at that, I'm starting to exude.

109
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,381
- Wanna get that?
- Not particularly.

110
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,778
- Could you get that?
- I suppose I could if I were asked.

111
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:36,956
- Would you please get that?
- Well, of course.

112
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:41,591
Why do you have to make things
so complicated?

113
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:44,761
- Dr. Cooper?
- Yes.

114
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:47,869
I'm Special Agent Page, FBI.

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,371
You say you're Special Agent Page,
FBI.

116
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:56,238
Here's my ID.

117
00:06:56,413 --> 00:07:01,146
And here is my Justice League
membership card.

118
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,446
But that doesn't prove
I know Batman.

119
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,191
I just wanna ask you a few questions
about Howard Wolowitz.

120
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:13,421
Oh. Well, all right.

121
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:16,261
I doubt anyone would risk
the stiff penalties...

122
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,924
...for impersonating a federal officer
just to ask questions...

123
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:23,038
...about a minor league engineer
with an unresolved Oedipal complex.

124
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:28,040
- Thank you.
- For the record, I truly support the FBI...

125
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:31,203
...in the mission
which is expressed through their motto.

126
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:33,916
Fidelity, bravery, integrity?

127
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:36,017
Correct. Now to business.

128
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:40,817
Eighteen years ago,
I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples...

129
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,687
...from a bag of excrement that had
been lit on fire on my front porch...

130
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:50,232
...for fingerprinting and DNA analysis.

131
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,333
Why haven't I heard back yet?

132
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:56,795
Well, the FBI Crime Lab
does have a lot on its plate.

133
00:07:57,006 --> 00:08:00,533
That's of little comfort to a nation
attempting to scrape burning feces...

134
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,075
...off its shoes.

135
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:05,246
Would you mind
if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?

136
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:08,043
A little, but go on.

137
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:09,549
Thank you.

138
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:11,949
Would you characterize him
as responsible?

139
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,718
I'm going to answer that
with a visual aid.

140
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:22,256
This is my nine-disc complete
Lord of the Rings trilogy Blu-ray set.

141
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:24,262
Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it...

142
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:28,733
...damaged plastic retention
hub number three...

143
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:35,205
...and then returned it to me
hoping I wouldn't notice.

144
00:08:35,378 --> 00:08:38,973
Would you characterize that
as responsible?

145
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:41,878
That's really not the sort of thing
we're interested in.

146
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:46,722
- You heard me say Blu-ray, right?
- I did.

147
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:50,287
Very well,
would you be interested in knowing...

148
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:54,259
...that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck
onto my "World of Warcraft" account...

149
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,228
...and changed the name
of a certain level-80 warlock...

150
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,369
...from "Sheldor" to "Smeldor"?

151
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:04,134
I'm afraid not. Is there anything else?

152
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:06,535
Anything else?
Where would you like to start?

153
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:09,769
He refuses to pay fines when
he's overdue with books I lend him...

154
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:13,040
...he crashed the Mars Rover
while attempting to impress a woman.

155
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:15,945
He recommended that I go see
the third Matrix movie...

156
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:19,953
...because it was, and I quote,
"Just as good as the first one."

157
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,055
If that's not irresponsible,
I don't know what is.

158
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,818
The Mars Rover?

159
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,535
- Did I say Mars Rover?
- You did.

160
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:37,163
That was actually
a poorly-chosen example...

161
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,604
...as it had nothing to do with me.

162
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,609
- Yes, well, let's talk about it anyway.
- I don't want to.

163
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:47,272
Not that my disinclination
to discuss the topic...

164
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,317
...should be interpreted as evidence
of Howard Wolowitz's culpability...

165
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:53,614
...in the destruction of government
property worth millions of dollars.

166
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:56,485
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
I think I have all I need.

167
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,786
Oh, good.

168
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:02,864
I was afraid you were going to fixate
on that Mars Rover incident.

169
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:09,637
Hey, buddies.

170
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:13,298
Guess who didn't get security clearance
to work on the giant space laser?

171
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:16,206
- What happened?
- The background interviews didn't go well.

172
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:19,074
You guys wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

173
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:24,709
Well, actually, I may have gotten
a little tipsy when I talked to her.

174
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:27,884
And I may have hit on her a little bit.

175
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,953
And I may have thrown up rum cake
on her shoes.

176
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:36,660
I see. Well, it's good to know
when I need you guys...

177
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:40,529
...I can always count on you
to step up and ruin everything.

178
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:44,663
- I feel awful.
- Me too.

179
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:48,037
I thought if anyone was gonna
screw things up for Howard...

180
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,838
...it'd be Sheldon.

181
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,009
Well, your expectations
have been subverted.

182
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,342
Ha, ha.

183
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:04,853
What are you doing up?

184
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:06,995
Sleep eludes me, Leonard.

185
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:08,322
Really?

186
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:10,898
Maybe sleep has met you before.

187
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:14,163
Mockery? That's all you have to offer?

188
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,770
- I'm sorry. Why can't you sleep?
- Who knows?

189
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,568
I haven't watched
any scary movies recently.

190
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:22,336
I'm no longer obsessing
over why the predicted mass...

191
00:11:22,512 --> 00:11:26,243
...of the quantum vacuum has little
effect on the expansion of the universe.

192
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,852
And it's been weeks since I took
that accidental sip of Red Bull.

193
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,121
Did something happen today
that's bothering you?

194
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:37,292
Well, I did mention the Mars Rover
incident to that FBI agent...

195
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,020
...and probably cost Howard
his security clearance.

196
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:43,062
- What?
- Yeah, but why should that keep me up?

197
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,190
Because you feel guilty?

198
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:47,459
Interesting.

199
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:51,698
So you're saying my insomnia
is caused by a guilty conscience.

200
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:54,775
Actually, you don't have insomnia.
You're sleeping now.

201
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:58,038
- Excuse me?
- You're having a guilt-ridden dream.

202
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,738
Do you have any evidence
to support that hypothesis?

203
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,248
How about that Gorn
sitting on the couch?

204
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,918
That seems fairly conclusive.

205
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:12,959
No, Gorn, no.

206
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:16,063
That's where I sit.

207
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,731
Thank you for agreeing to see me,
Agent Page.

208
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:24,634
Thank you for filing a complaint
with my superior, Dr. Cooper.

209
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:29,241
I understand you wanna recant
your statement about Howard Wolowitz.

210
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:32,243
- Yes.
- Was your statement untrue?

211
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:33,507
No.

212
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,745
Then I'm afraid you can't withdraw it.

213
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:40,912
I'm sorry,
I don't recall you saying no backsies.

214
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,757
Is there anything else?

215
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,520
Yes, I'd like to offer
a laudatory statement...

216
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:50,325
...about Howard's many excellent
qualities I believe will tip the scales...

217
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,333
...back in his favor. Ahem.
"Howard Joel Wolowitz.

218
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:56,939
H is for honesty,
of which he has much.

219
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,597
O is for outstanding, which he is such.

220
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:02,301
W is for witty, he's quick with a joke.

221
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:04,446
A is for artistic, his ability..."

222
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:07,445
I'm sorry, Dr. Cooper,
this matter is already closed.

223
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,517
But I still have "ard Joel Wolowitz"
left to go.

224
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,647
It's closed.

225
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:17,119
I don't understand why you people
are picking on my friend Howard...

226
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:19,817
...when there are much more serious
security threats to pursue.

227
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:21,964
For instance,
when I first met Leonard...

228
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:25,862
...he was on the verge of giving away
rocket secrets to a North Korean spy...

229
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:28,731
...and not one agent
ever investigated that.

230
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:31,663
This is Leonard Hofstadter?

231
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:35,966
No, it's a different Leonard.
He's Chinese, red hair, six fingers.

232
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:37,169
Goodbye.

233
00:13:41,017 --> 00:13:43,577
Raj, have you seen Howard?

234
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,685
I think he's eating lunch.

235
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:48,356
Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet
Neil DeGrasse Tyson...

236
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:50,287
...from the Hayden Planetarium
in New York.

237
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,894
I'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson.

238
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:56,657
He's responsible for the demotion
of Pluto from planetary status.

239
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,164
I liked Pluto...

240
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:03,530
...ergo, I do not like you.
- But I actually didn't demote Pluto.

241
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:06,368
That was a vote of
the International Astronomical Union.

242
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:11,206
If ifs and buts were candy and nuts,
we'd all have a merry Christmas.

243
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:13,379
Think about that, Dr. Tyson.

244
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:17,549
That the guy you
were telling me about?

245
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,051
Oh, yeah.

246
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:26,388
Howard, the person at fault for you
not getting a security clearance is me.

247
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:29,926
- You?
- Yes, but before you get upset...

248
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:33,227
...I want you to know I went to the FBI
and retracted my statement.

249
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,794
And they were okay with that?

250
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,802
No. If anything, I made it worse.

251
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:41,800
In any case,
I have been riddled with guilt...

252
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,275
...which is causing
Gorn-infested REM sleep.

253
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:50,113
- So I'm here now to say I'm sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

254
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:52,584
You've set my career back
at least two years...

255
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:55,622
...and you think you can make it right
with "I'm sorry"?

256
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,383
Yes.

257
00:14:57,593 --> 00:14:59,083
I followed the social protocol.

258
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:01,730
I attempted to right the wrong
and when I failed...

259
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:05,800
...I delivered a heartfelt apology.
Now, you say "apology accepted"...

260
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:09,267
...and I will offer you
a one-time-only high five.

261
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,740
Your apology is not accepted.

262
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,843
You're tricking me. It really is, isn't it?

263
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,445
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

264
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,415
Dr. Cooper,
I just wanted you to know...

265
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:25,850
...I’m sorry for the role I played
in the Pluto matter.

266
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,750
Oh, shut up.

267
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:33,989
- Sheldon?
- Hello.

268
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:36,956
What are you doing here?

269
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,157
I have troubles, Penny.

270
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:42,834
I've come to pour them out to
the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.

271
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,837
You know, they have a really nice bar
over at the Olive Garden.

272
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:51,278
I don't like the Olive Garden.
They treat me like family.

273
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:56,512
- Okay, Sheldon, what can I get you?
- Alcohol.

274
00:15:57,353 --> 00:16:01,119
- Could you be a little more specific?
- Ethyl alcohol.

275
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,621
Forty milliliters.

276
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:05,117
I'm sorry, honey,
I don't know milliliters.

277
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:08,354
Ah. Blame President James Jimmy Carter.

278
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:11,989
He started America on a path
to the metric system but then just gave up.

279
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,667
He wonders
why he was a one-term president.

280
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,099
- Would you say that's 40 milliliters?
- More or less.

281
00:16:19,308 --> 00:16:20,332
Great.

282
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:23,603
Now where were we?

283
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:26,577
I believe you were about to ask me
to choose a cocktail.

284
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:29,980
Fortunately,
thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics...

285
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:32,245
...there's an app for that.

286
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:36,222
Let's see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh.

287
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,326
Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so.

288
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:43,154
Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter.

289
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:44,390
Ooh.

290
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:48,025
- I'll have a Rosewater Rickey.
- A what?

291
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:50,762
"You'll need pitted,
brandied cherries, gin...

292
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:54,033
...rosewater, Angostura bitters
and over-proofed rum.

293
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,542
Now first,
dust the cherries with sugar...

294
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:59,408
...then spray them
with a mixture of rum and bitters.

295
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:03,450
- Then ignite the rum..."
- Here you go, one Rosewater Rickey.

296
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:06,052
That's not how it looks in the picture.

297
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:08,520
Oh, yeah,
every bartender makes it differently.

298
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:12,183
- Why don't you give it a try?
- All right.

299
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:16,028
To the metric system.

300
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:28,909
I can't taste the cherries.

301
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:32,941
All right, Sheldon,
what's on your mind?

302
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,775
I wronged Howard
and he won't accept my apology.

303
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:38,044
Oh, right, that.

304
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,188
Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.

305
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:43,122
Penny,
you face failure on a daily basis.

306
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:48,396
- How do you cope?
- I drink.

307
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:51,994
To drinking.

308
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:56,594
Nope.

309
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:03,510
If only there were some way to
force Howard to accept my apology...

310
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:06,341
...so I could escape
this miasma of guilt.

311
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:09,915
Sometimes just stuff happens
and there's nothing you can do about it.

312
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:13,249
For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked
to me since 11th grade.

313
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:15,287
No matter how much you apologize...

314
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,291
...you can't go back
and undry-hump someone's boyfriend.

315
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:20,588
I see.

316
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:23,698
You're saying I'm facing
Starfleet Academy's...

317
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:27,233
The Kobayashi Maru.

318
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:29,631
Exactly. Sometimes you can't win.

319
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,966
Captain Kirk won.

320
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,334
Kirk cheated.

321
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,446
Impressive that you know that.

322
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:43,350
Hard to believe I'm actually having
this conversation with you.

323
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,544
Right there with you.

324
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:51,657
Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru
by reprogramming the simulator.

325
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,492
- That's it.
- What?

326
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:55,357
I'll reprogram Howard.

327
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:58,830
Wait...
Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.

328
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,628
No, you can't reprogram people.

329
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:05,965
To James Tiberius Kirk.

330
00:19:15,818 --> 00:19:17,752
- Hello, all.
- Hello.

331
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,084
Howard, you're feeling better
about me today, aren't you?

332
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:25,657
- Not really.
- Yes, you are.

333
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:30,356
I'm using neuro-linguistic programming
to modify your thought patterns.

334
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:34,169
Go away, Sheldon.

335
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:37,399
There's a 9.95 eBook
down the drain.

336
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:39,907
- What's in the bag?
- It's for Howard.

337
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:42,908
No, Sheldon,
you can't fix this with gifts.

338
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:46,377
Nevertheless, I've hurt you
and whether you forgive me or not...

339
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:48,550
...I want you to have this.

340
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,712
You're giving me a couch cushion?

341
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:55,083
No. The cushion is merely symbolic.

342
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,953
I'm giving you my spot on the couch.

343
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,030
But you love that spot.

344
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:04,461
No, I love my mother.

345
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:08,433
My feelings for my spot
are much greater.

346
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:14,436
It is the singular location in space around
which revolves my entire universe.

347
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:17,111
And now it's yours.

348
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:21,639
Oh, my God, dude,
now you have to forgive him.

349
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:25,883
All right. Uh, apology accepted.

350
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:28,053
High five.

351
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,089
Not too hard.

352
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:32,894
Thank you.

353
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:36,360
I haven't cried like this
since Toy Story 3.

354
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:49,470
I gotta tell you, Sheldon,
I understand why you chose this spot.

355
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:52,478
I mean, the temperature's good,
but there's no draft.

356
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:55,139
I can see the television,
but I can still talk to...

357
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:57,342
I changed my mind.
Get out of my spot.

358
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:02,716
- How long?
- Ninety-four seconds.
