死亡名单

5
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:50,480
抱歉 大臣 报上有些东西您得看看
Minister, there's something in the press you should see.

6
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:53,956
说我的?      对 可惜登在《侦探》上
About me? I'm afraid it's in Private Eye.

7
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:59,405
《侦探》?      对 他们专门揭人底牌
Private Eye? Yes... They're exposing something.

8
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:03,915
不是我为萨冯博士作的品行推荐吧?
Not that character reference I gave for Dr Savundra?

9
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:07,123
波尔森家那个派对?      我不知道有这回事 大臣
That party at Poulson's? I didn't know about those.

10
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:11,677
没有 那种垃圾小报就爱编这些
No, that's the thing they make up in that little rag

11
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:15,634
那是什么?      您最好自己看
What is it? Perhaps you'd better read it.

12
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:22,080
天哪      太恐怖了 是吗?
Good God Frightful, isn't it?

13
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:26,317
我能进来吗 大臣?      坐下 汉弗莱 听听这个
May I come in, Minister? Listen to this.

14
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,399
什么?《侦探》啊 太好了
What's that? Oh, Private Eye? Splendid

15
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:33,797
"加斯里绝密安全报告传奇"
"The saga of the top secret Guthrie Report,

16
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:38,278
"上周本报报道内容 继续让大臣们头痛"
"revealed to the Eye last week embarrass Ministers.

17
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:42,439
"据悉某现任内阁大臣 在野时曾饱受电话监听"
"one of the present Cabinet subjected to phone-tapping,

18
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:45,882
"窃听器以及24小时监视困扰"
"bugging and 24-hour surveillance while in opposition

19
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:49,356
"他就是政坛大鳄吉姆・哈克"
"was none other than the egregious Jim Hacker."

20
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,994
什么叫"大鳄"?
What's "egregious" mean?

21
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,124
我想是"出类拔萃"的意思
I think it means "outstanding".

22
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:57,004
哦?
Oh...?

23
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:00,759
褒义或者贬义
In one way or another.

24
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:03,478
"他的行政事务部"
"...Jim Hacker, whose department administers

25
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:06,478
"管理23000名管理人员"
23,000 other administrators.

26
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:10,355
"风水轮流转 这位大鳄吉姆 如今负责"
Ironically, it is egregious Jim's department now responsible

27
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:14,838
"提供政府所有电脑化监听设备"
for supplying government's computerised bugging equipment

28
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:20,399
"可想而知 他正是当今政府监听头目"
Presumably, this makes him the government's chief bugger

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
太好了
Wonderful

30
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:24,321
汉弗莱 这是真的吗?      哪部分 大臣?
Is this true? Which, Minister?

31
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:28,320
我被监听过 现在又负责监听设备
I was under surveillance and am now responsible for bugging

32
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:32,445
您不会相信那垃圾小报吧?
Surely, you don't believe what you read in that squalid little rag.

33
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:36,519
别管那个 是真的吗?      别太当真 大臣
Never mind. Is it true? Don't take it too seriously.

34
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:40,042
我要当真 它说我曾受全面监视
Well, I do This says I was under total surveillance.

35
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:44,722
我是国会议员 自由公民 这直接践踏民主核心
An MP and free citizen It cuts at the very heart of democracy

36
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:47,525
还违反欧洲人权公约 知道吗?
It contravenes human rights.

37
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,039
噢 对...
Oh, yes...

38
00:02:49,206 --> 00:02:53,518
监视是打击有组织犯罪的必备武器
Surveillance is indispensable against organised crime.

39
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:57,076
你不是把政客归为有组织犯罪吧?
You're not describing politicians as organised crime?

40
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:59,965
也打击无组织犯罪 当然
Disorganised crime, too, of course

41
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:04,722
汉弗莱 我在《改革》做编辑时专门为此写过社论
Humphrey I once wrote a leader on this as editor of Reform

42
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:09,243
并发起过全国请愿 抗议官僚们多管闲事
and started a petition against bureaucratic busybodies,

43
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,203
到处监视人们 窃听电话
bugging and phone-tapping.

44
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:15,598
如今我从《侦探》而不是你汉弗莱那里得知
Now I learn from Private Eye, Humphrey, not from you,

45
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:18,997
我负责所有监听设备 你怎么没告诉我?
that I'm responsible for it, and you never told me.

46
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,600
您没有问啊
You didn't ask.

47
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:26,715
幸好我们有自由的报纸 有仗义执言的文章
Thank God for a free press and for one fearless journal

48
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:28,756
您刚叫它垃圾小报
You said it was a squalid rag.

49
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:32,756
伯纳 你的政治觉悟有待提高
Sharpen up your antennae.

50
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:36,714
要学会用发展的眼光看问题
Learn to adapt more flexibly to a developing situation.

51
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:38,842
我明白了 对不起
I see. I'm sorry.

52
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:43,158
监视记录都送到哪里?
Where are the transcripts of these bugged conversations?

53
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,920
它们会被写成报告
They were put into a report.

54
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:49,123
给谁看过?      一直交给内政大臣
Who got these reports? The Home Secretary gets them.

55
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:51,846
一直? 一直?
Gets them? Gets them?

56
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:55,362
不是写您的 大臣 现在不是了
Not about you, Minister. Not now.

57
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,565
现在只给他反对党的报告
Now he'll be getting reports about Her Majesty's opposition.

58
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:04,519
谁把这些拿给他?      军情五处吧 我猜
Who gives them to him? Ml5, presumably.

59
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:08,201
你似乎对这一切很冷静啊      是的 大臣
You seem very calm about all this. Yes, Minister.

60
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:12,882
这太恐怖了 一名卓著的公民
I think it's horrifying, a distinguished citizen -

61
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:17,164
可以说 一名出类拔萃的英国公民      是哦
if I may say so, an extremely distinguished British citizen -

62
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:20,318
为祖国鞠躬尽瘁一辈子
who's given his life's service to his country,

63
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:24,320
发现官僚们暗地里听着他的每一句话
finds these bureaucrats have listened to his every word.

64
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:29,355
他的电话 他吼老婆骂孩子
All his phone calls. His rows with his wife and daughter.

65
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:32,962
他私下约见会计... 不是说我
His private arrangements with his accountant Not that I..

66
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:35,799
不 绝对不是      为什么 汉弗莱?
No, quite so. Well, why, Humphrey?

67
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,844
为什么监视 还是为什么监视您?     两个都要问
Why surveillance or why you? Both

68
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:42,919
反正答案是一样的      那干吗分成两个问题?
It's the same answer. Why split it into two questions?

69
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:46,840
我不想冒险回答您没问的问题 大臣
I didn't want to risk answering a question you weren't asking.

70
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:50,078
那我现在问你了 为什么监视我?
I'm asking you now. Why was I under surveillance?

71
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,806
再明显不过了 介意我坐下吗?
It's perfectly obvious. Do you mind?

72
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,324
您看 大选前有传闻
Before the election, it was rumoured

73
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:58,324
说您会任国防部长
you'd be appointed Defence Secretary.

74
00:04:58,486 --> 00:04:59,805
所以呢?
So?

75
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,437
首相要交给您国防部 为国家利益着想
If the PM was giving you defence, in the national interest,

76
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:09,361
军情五处得先确定您不是安全隐患
that Ml5 must be satisfied you weren't a security risk.

77
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:13,804
侵犯我的隐私权      总比侵犯您的国家好 大臣
My privacy was invaded Better than your country, Minister.

78
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:17,919
你被监视过吗?
Have you ever been under surveillance?

79
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:20,919
我吗 大臣?      是你
Me, Minister? You.

80
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:23,884
我是个公务员
I'm a civil servant

81
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:27,040
伯尼斯和麦克林也是(冷战时期克格勃间谍)
So were Burgess and MacLean.

82
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:29,925
那是...      还有菲尔比(同上)
Oh, well... And Philby

83
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:32,316
他们不是常任秘书
They weren't Permanent Secretaries.

84
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:34,803
做常任秘书的人
One becomes a Permanent Secretary

85
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:38,403
必须一贯忠诚可靠
after a life of reliability and integrity

86
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:42,275
经过最严格细致的筛选
The rigorous selection procedures winnow out all

87
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:45,916
只留下最正直可敬的公务员
but the most upright and honourable public servants.

88
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:51,160
那大臣呢?      大臣当然有许多杰出品质
And what about Ministers? They have many dazzling qualities

89
00:05:51,326 --> 00:05:54,079
比如...
Including...?

90
00:05:56,526 --> 00:06:02,237
高度的思想服从以及精神可操纵性
Enviable intellectual suppleness and moral manoeuvrability.

91
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,636
你要说什么 汉弗莱?
What are you trying to say?

92
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:08,879
他们不可信 当然不是您 大臣
You can't trust them Not you, of course, Minister.

93
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:12,800
不像公务员 大臣是随机抽取而来
Ministers, unlike civil servants, are selected at random

94
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,764
全凭首相一时兴致
by prime ministerial whim,

95
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:19,601
报答他们莫须有的贡献
in recognition of dubious services rendered,

96
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:23,600
或者为避免任命真正的贤才
or to avoid appointing someone of real ability.

97
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,475
不是说您 大臣 您当然值得信赖
Not you, Minister You certainly are to be trusted.

98
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:33,401
这么说吧 您几乎可以当公务员了
You might almost be a civil servant yourself

99
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:36,558
是夸我吗?      是的 大臣 最高的赞赏
Is that a compliment? Indeed. The ultimate compliment.

100
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,239
大臣 您相信您的所有内阁同僚
Would you trust every Cabinet colleague

101
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:44,000
都不会泄密吗?
never to betray a confidence?

102
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:49,478
反对党领袖呢?      他们? 开什么玩笑
And all the opposition front bench? You must be joking

103
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:52,319
您当时也是反对党
You were in the opposition at the time.

104
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:56,479
随便吧 汉弗莱 我还是要阻止这种事
Be that as it may, I have decided I'm going to stop it.

105
00:06:56,646 --> 00:07:02,357
但这归内政部管 大臣      至少要加大难度
This is a Home Office matter.  I'll make it harder.

106
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:07,156
既然我负责设备 我要设置些民主保障
If I'm responsible for bugging, I want democratic safeguards

107
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:12,354
您是不是建议 人们不受监视
Are you suggest that people won't be put under surveillance

108
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:16,439
除非他们填一份同意表呢?
until they've signed a form agreeing to it?

109
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:22,238
不 要由两院设置特别委员会 上院法官核准
No, we'll have a select committee to vet every application,

110
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:27,561
每延长2周 需重新申请
no surveillance to last over two weeks without application

111
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:31,958
你能着手帮我处理吗 汉弗莱?
Will you set the wheels in motion, please, Humphrey?

112
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:34,117
好的 大臣
Very well, Minister.

113
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:39,556
伯纳 给每位内阁成员送一份摘要
Bernard, send a minute to each Cabinet member.

114
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,435
我要找个后座议员质询内政部长
I'll plant a question for a backbencher to ask.

115
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:48,680
"您能向下院保证 各位同僚没有受监视吗?"
Can you assure us no colleagues have been under surveillance?

116
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:52,475
这就差不多了吧?      当然 大臣
That should shake him. It certainly will.

117
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:56,719
让《快报》的沃尔特福勒今晚到下院找我喝一杯
Ask Walter Fowler of the Express to meet me for a drink.

118
00:07:56,886 --> 00:08:00,515
为什么呢 大臣?      政坛泄密第一法则
What for, Minister? First law of political indiscretion:

119
00:08:00,686 --> 00:08:03,917
酒后吐真言
Always have a drink before you leak.

120
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,804
能写成报导吗?      能
Will it make a story? Yes.

121
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:19,925
"大臣为反电话窃听而战" 行
"Minister fights for phone-tap safeguard." Yes

122
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:25,444
会放在哪里?      国内新闻头条
Where will they run it? High up on the home news page.

123
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:29,519
不是头版吗?      能署明是你吗?
Not on page one? Can I attribute it?

124
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:32,723
"大臣透露"?      不行不行
"Minister speaks out"? No, no, no.

125
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:38,279
那源头怎么说呢? 也不能说 "官方公布"
Where did I get the story? I can't say Officially announced

126
00:08:38,446 --> 00:08:41,085
"政府发言人"?
"Government spokesman"?

127
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,685
"大臣亲信" 怎么样?
How about, "Sources close to Minister"?

128
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:50,203
不行 别让大家知道是我透露的
Hold on, I don't want everybody to know I told you

129
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:53,756
不能说"议会呼声日渐高涨"吗?
Couldn't you do, "Speculation is growing in Westminster"?

130
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:55,917
欠点力度
A bit weak.

131
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:58,644
"非官方发言人"?
"Unofficial spokesman"?

132
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,843
本周已经用过两次了
Used that twice this week already

133
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:05,555
内阁漏得跟筛子一样 是吧?
The Cabinet's leaking like a sieve, isn't it?

134
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:11,795
不能写是筛子...不 内阁领导人吗?
Attribute it to a leading member of the sieve... Cabinet?

135
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,604
不行
No...

136
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:19,638
管你叫"消息灵通人士"怎样?
How would you like to be "an informed source"?

137
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,445
好 "消息灵通人士"
OK. "Informed source."

138
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:26,645
真好笑 对吧 说某人"消息灵通"
Quite a joke, isn't it, describing someone as "informed"

139
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:30,799
而他的常任秘书却是汉弗莱・阿普比爵士
when his Permanent Secretary is Sir Humphrey Appleby?

140
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:41,435
我们的电话 私人对话 都被录了音转成文本
Everything we said on the phone, recorded and transcribed.

141
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:45,121
真丢人      是有点丢人
It's humiliating It is a little humiliating.

142
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:50,076
军情五处有人知道 你在家也说外头那套话
That Ml5 know you talk at home as you talk in public.

143
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:55,684
国民生产总值 贷款条件 党内议程草案
Gross product, borrowing requirements, draft agendas...

144
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,395
不是这些 是说我们私底下的聊天
I didn't mean that I meant our private talk.

145
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,603
我怎么就没想到 "你带车钥匙了吗?"
I hadn't thought of that..."Got the car keys?"

146
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:07,681
"没 我以为你带了" 真能让政府垮台
"I thought you had them" That'll bring the government down

147
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:11,634
你没把它当真      干吗这么想?
You're not taking it seriously. What gives you that idea?

148
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:15,958
他们能听到我们...在床上说的
They might've heard what we said... in bed

149
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:20,082
怎么 你打呼噜用密码吗?
Why? Do you snore in code?

150
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:25,119
你在暗示什么吗?      既然你问了 快放假了
You trying to tell me something? Since you ask,

151
00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:29,598
要不要出去度周末 像以前那样?
why don't we go away for the weekend like we used to?

152
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,200
好啊 怎么不要? 管他的
Yes. Why not? What the hell

153
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,119
去金伯利草原吧      好 在哪?
Let's go to Kingsbury Down. Where?

154
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:39,074
就是我们度蜜月的地方 亲爱的
Only where we spent our honeymoon, darling

155
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:40,565
啊 对
Yes...

156
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,842
你在那里第一次向我解释
Where you first explained to me

157
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:49,036
流通速度对货币供应净增值的影响
Velocity of circulation on the net growth of money supply.

158
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:51,595
对 我想起来了
Yeah... I remember.

159
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,564
都听见啦 小伙子们?
Did you get that, boys?

160
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:01,076
大臣...上了死亡名单?
The Minister... on a death list?

161
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:05,000
什么是国际自由军?
Well, who are the International Freedom Army?

162
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,205
我们还没查出来      为什么要暗杀大臣?
We do not, as yet, know. Why assassinate the Minister?

163
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,357
他又没有威胁性
He's so harmless

164
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:15,876
那也不能拿大臣的性命去冒险
Nevertheless, we cannot risk the Minister's life.

165
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:18,958
当然不能 就是说全面...?      对
No. That means the full...? Quite

166
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:24,041
早安 大臣      早安 大臣 您好吗
Morning, Minister Morning, Minister, how are you?

167
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:28,916
对不起迟到了 昨晚没睡好     那太遗憾了 大臣
Sorry I'm late. Didn't sleep well. Sorry to hear that.

168
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:31,441
真的 我觉得像要死了
Actually, I feel like death.

169
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,884
可能这样也好
Perhaps that's just as well.

170
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:42,039
看今早的《快报》了吗?      看了
See this morning's Express? Indeed.

171
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:46,404
"大臣限制电话监听"     真不知他们哪来的消息
Minister acts to curb phone taps Wonder where they got that

172
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:49,764
大概有人泄密 真恐怖对吧?
A leak, I suppose. Terrible, isn't it?

173
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,245
真恐怖
Terrible.

174
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:54,555
这只会激励我干到底
It only reaffirms my determination to act.

175
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:58,721
大臣 您真的已经三思了吗?
Are you sure you've considered all the implications?

176
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:01,635
对 自由公民享有隐私权
Yes. Free citizens have a right to privacy.

177
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:06,834
要是军情五处有理由相信 这些自由公民
But suppose Ml5 believe these free citizens were,

178
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:10,123
容我假设一下
to take a purely hypothetical example,

179
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:12,595
计划暗杀一位大臣呢?
planning to assassinate a Minister?

180
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:17,763
英国人民的自由远重于大臣的生命
Freedom of the people is worth more than a Minister's life

181
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:19,882
自由是无价之宝
Freedom is indivisible.

182
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:22,685
大臣牺牲无所谓
Ministers are expendable.

183
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:29,402
公众人物得随时准备成为暴徒的目标
Men in public life expect to be the target of fanatics.

184
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:34,242
大臣理应把生死置之度外
It is a Minister's duty to set his life at naught.

185
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:39,639
他得站出来高呼 "我在这里 向我开炮"
Able to stand up and say, "Here I am Do your worst"

186
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:43,524
而不是战战兢兢
And not cower in craven terror

187
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:46,325
藏身于电子监视设备
behind electronic equipment,

188
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:48,363
秘密话筒
secret microphones

189
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:54,635
和极权国家种种骇人手段后面
and all the hideous apparatus... of the police state.

190
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:58,078
汉弗莱 你不用说了
Ahem... I don't want to hear about it.

191
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,556
大臣 关于此事我还得说一句话
I must say one more thing on this matter.

192
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,523
好吧 就一句 简单点
Very well. Be brief.

193
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:06,837
特工处发现您上了死亡名单
Special Branch have found your name on a death list.

194
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,566
这事毫无参考价值
That has no bearing on the situation.

195
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:11,364
什么?
What?

196
00:13:12,646 --> 00:13:17,561
特工处发现您上了死亡名单
Special Branch have found your name on a death list.

197
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:20,957
什么死亡名单?      就是暗杀名单
A death list...? An assassination.

198
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:25,483
我知道什么叫死亡名单 但你什么意思?
I know what you mean by death list, but what do you mean?

199
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:30,963
我还真没法解释了 大臣
I don't think I can put it any more clearly, Minister.

200
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,356
坦率地说
To put it absolutely bluntly,

201
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:36,996
秘密调查证明有这样一份文件
investigations have proved the existence of documents

202
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,441
它的出处无从考究
whose provenance is unestablished

203
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:43,121
但它会造成一次补缺选举
but whose effect would be to precipitate a bye-election.

204
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:45,516
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

205
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:48,359
您上了死亡名单 大臣
You're on a death list, Minister.

206
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:50,118

00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:54,165
叫国际自由军 一支新生的城市游击队
The International Freedom Army, a new urban guerrilla group.

208
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:58,205
干吗跟我过不去?      您可能记得
What've they got against me? As you may recall,

209
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:01,119
有谣言说内阁要重组
there have been rumours of a Cabinet reshuffle,

210
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:05,916
据称您可能出任国防部长
and your name was linked with the Ministry of Defence.

211
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:10,477
他们是谁?      说不好 可能是爱尔兰分裂派
Who can they be? An Irish splinter group?

212
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:16,482
赤军旅 巴解组织 黑色九月 或者国产暴徒

Iranians or the Italian Red Brigade, for all we know.

215
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:28,603
他们互相勾结 所以也可能是一群新兴的自由杀手
All connected. it could be a group of freelance killers

216
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:32,400
特工处也无从下手
Special Branch don't know where to start.

217
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:36,400
你说名单 上面不会只有我吧?      不是 大臣
The list isn't just me? Not just you, Minister.

218
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:39,603
一定有几百人...      只有三个
There must be hundreds on... Just three.

219
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,957
只有三个
Just three.

220
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:48,316

223
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,325
他会通知您的      探员?
This man will inform you. Detectives?

224
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:00,159
他们防不住放黑枪的 对吧? 没人能
They can't protect you against the assassin's bullet

225
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:06,083
当然不 但他们能将犯人绳之以法
But they can determine the assassin is brought to trial.

226
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:11,161
当然 是在受害被撂倒之后
After the victim has been gunned down, of course.

227
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,559
特工处的福雷队长

Thank you, Bernard. Do I have to take it seriously?

234
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,403
这个随您便 先生 我们建议...
In a sense, that's up to you. We advise...

235
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:41,879
换别人早就惊慌失措了 但对我只是日常工作

暗杀事件分为四种

240
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:58,081
枪杀 炸弹 毒药 还有所谓的意外

242
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:06,485
绞死 宗教活祭 但在英国不常见
garrotting and ritual disembowelling are uncommon in the UK.

243
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,365
那就好      先从枪杀开始
All right, then. Start with bullets.

244
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:13,041
暗杀者从高楼或车里开枪
There's your assassin on a tall building or in a car,

245
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,595

259
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,518

260
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:14,602

279
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,523
痛快
Quicker

280
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:44,405
汉弗莱 怎么在恐怖分子找到我前找到他们呢?
how do we find these terrorists before they find me?

281
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:50,277
窃听电话和电子监控嫌疑人是最好的方法
Phone tapping and surveillance of suspects is the best way,

282
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:55,201
但这会严重侵犯到个人隐私
but it does incur intrusion on individual privacy.

283
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:03,682
话说回来
On the other hand...

284
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:08,442
人民代表旨在...代表人民
the people's representatives must represent the people.

285
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,565
威胁他们就是威胁民主 对吧?
Any threat to them is a threat against democracy, isn't it?

286
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,317
会吗?
How?

287
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:19,639
这些威胁会侵犯
These threats constitute

288
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:24,004
人民的天赋权利
an attack on the people's inalienable democratic right

289
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,718
领导是他们选的
to have leaders of their choice

290
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:29,718
得不惜一切代价严密保护
who must be protected by every possible means

291
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:33,765
不管我们对这种状况多么遗憾
no matter how much we regret the necessity for doing so.

292
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:37,077
说得好 大臣 正是我的想法
Beautifully argued, Minister. My view exactly.

293
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:40,238
不然您就要完蛋了
Or else you're a dead duck.

294
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,717
天哪 这是什么?
Good God What's that?

295
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:45,116
大臣 请愿书到了      请愿书?
The petition's arrived. Petition?

296
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:48,005
反对电话窃听与监视的请愿书
Against phone tapping and surveillance.

297
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:52,284
您在野时发动的 225万个签名 大获成功
The one you started in opposition. 2.25 million signatures.

298
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:54,277
但我们需要监视啊
But we need surveillance

299
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:57,643
这是打击有组织犯罪的必备武器 对吧?
It's an essential weapon in our fight against crime, right?

300
00:19:57,806 --> 00:20:00,559
精辟 我就说不出来
I couldn't have put it better myself.

301
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:02,323
明白了 要把它们存档吗?
I see. Shall I file it?

302
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:06,323
存档? 销毁了 别让人找到
Shred it No one must find it.

303
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:09,876
既然这样 还是存档最好
In that case, I think it's best I file it.

304
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,443
真是再度蜜月的好方法啊
Great way to spend a second honeymoon

305
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:43,925
几人的桌子?
Table for...?

306
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:45,519
8人      2人
Eight Two.

307
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:48,678
窗边有个好位子
I've a nice table by the window.

308
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:51,280
我们选定了目标的桌子      目标?
We've chosen the target's table. Target?

309
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:54,802
对不起 大臣 厨房门旁边那张
Sorry, Minister. Over there by the kitchen door.

310
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,403
您坐这里 先生
You sit here, sir.

311
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:05,957
罗斯警官看守厨房门 您的逃生路线
Ross will be watching the kitchen door, your escape route.

312
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:11,041
员工里不会有刺客 我们早上才订的位子
Not expecting assassins here since we only bookedmorning.

313
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:17,395
我坐窗边 要是听到枪响 钻桌底就行
If you hear gunshots, get under the table.

314
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,921
我其实不怎么担心
I'm not really worried.

315
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:30,715
只是开香槟 亲爱的
It was just a champagne cork, darling.

316
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,597
我演习一下
Just practising.

317
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:37,925
我要一份意大利腊肠面
I'll have spaghetti bolognaise,

318
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:43,956
T骨牛排 豌豆 青豆 花椰菜 薯片

319
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:49,120

and a bottle of Chteau Baron Philippe de Rothschild 1961.

320
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,400
这份工作很累人
Takes it out of you, this job.

321
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,236
很漂亮 对吧      很漂亮
Beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful.

322

安静平和

323
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:04,922
离开一切喧嚣真是太好了
Lovely to get away from it all.

324
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:07,077
太好了
Lovely.

325
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:19,236
还可以吧?      很好
This all right for you? Lovely.

326
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:22,204
我不想看007 说好了看《白日美人》的
Not James Bond? I thought it was "Belle du Jour".

327
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:26,359
对 可他们不想看外国电影
Yes, but they didn't want to see a foreign film.

328
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:13,277
我看够了
I can't stand this.

329
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:27,917
目标在里面了吗?      对 目标夫妻都在
Target in there now? Yeah, with his wife.

330
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:31,761
还出去吗?      不了 他们睡下了
They going out again? Nah, turned in for the night.

331
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:35,555
他们好像不怎么开心啊
They don't seem to be enjoying the holiday.

332
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,717
为什么呢?
Wonder why...?

333
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,681
我在这睡不着
I can't sleep here.

334
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:42,643
我要回家了
I'm going home.

335
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:48,034
这是干什么?
What the hell's all this?

336
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:52,199
本地警方 先生 他们要表示配合
Local force, sir, showing they're doing their bit.

337
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:08,965
进来 噢 你进来了
Come in. Oh, you're in

338
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:12,402
抱歉 先生 可以检查一下窗户吗?      请吧
May I just check the windows? Go ahead.

339
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,842
谢谢 晚安 先生
Thank you. Goodnight, sir.

340
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:21,803
睡个好觉
Sleep well.

341
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:27,639
别担心 亲爱的 你会习惯做名人的妻子的

342
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:29,205
那就好了
I hope so.

343
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:33,041
我可不想做名人的寡妇
I don't want to be a famous man's widow

344
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:36,356
可我不明白
But... I don't follow.

345
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:38,915
你说要阻止监视监听
You want to stop phone tapping,

346
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:44,399
请愿书得到了225万个签名 足以大书特书
you get this petition of 2.25 million signatures

347
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,479
但你却不愿发表一句感谢的话
and you won't even give me a quote saying you welcome it.

348
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:53,644
说"保证实施其纲领"如何?
A promise to implement its recommendations?

349
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:56,400
没那么简单 沃尔特      怎么?
It's not that simple. Why not?

350
00:24:56,566 --> 00:25:01,321
有安全隐患     隐患随时都有
There are security implications. There always were.

351
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:09,040
好 这个新闻更劲爆 "大臣否决自己的请愿"
I'll make a bigger story: Minister rejects his own petition

352
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:11,162
等一下 我...
Now, hold on I...

353
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:14,318
到底同意还是否决?
Are you accepting it or rejecting it?

354
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,198
不
No.

355
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:23,278
编辑要我问 是不是上死亡名单
My editor asks if being on this death list

356
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,278
改变了你对电话监听的立场
has altered your views on phone tapping.

357
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,679
天啊 真是异想天开
Heavens What an extraordinary idea

358
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:33,885
那为什么要改变论调呢?      没有改变论调
So why this change of tune? No change of tune.

359
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:40,122
汉弗莱爵士能说句话吗?      汉弗莱 什么事?
Can Sir Humphrey see you? Humphrey What can I do for you?

360
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:42,880
能出去一下吗      抱歉 马上就好
Excuse us. Won't be a minute.

361
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:44,764
我出去等      多谢配合
I'll wait out there.

362
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:46,245
周末还好吗 大臣?
Good weekend?

363
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:49,603
太好了 我 安妮 还有特工处一半人
Marvellous. Me, Annie and half of Special Branch.

364
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:54,476
警察们武装到牙齿 太难忘了      职责所系啊
Rozzers with guns. Unforgettable The burdens of office

365
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:59,083
不能老这样下去      说得好 大臣 不会继续了
This can't go on. You said it It isn't going to.

366
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:02,397
特工处刚通知 将撤回对您的保护
Special Branch is withdrawing your protection.

367
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:06,718
等一下 我不是那个意思 为什么?
Wait a minute I didn't mean... Why?

368
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:11,718
警察部门人员编制不足
They've suffered an acute personnel establishment shortfall.

369
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:15,515
他们干嘛?      人手短缺 不保护您了
They're what? Short-staffed. No more protection.

370
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:17,199
人手短缺?
Short-staffed?

371
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:22,281
苏联总理明天访问首相别墅 他更危险
There's a threat to the Soviet premier at Chequers.

372
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:25,677
但他是俄国人 我是英国人      实际上
But he's Russian, I'm British In fact,

373
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:30,158
特工处相信您已经没有生命危险了
They believe the threat to your life has diminished.

374
00:26:30,326 --> 00:26:32,078
他们怎么知道?
How do they know?

375
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:34,840
监听到一段对话
Surveillance of a conversation.

376
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:38,078
说的什么?      没什么...
What did it say? It's of no...

377
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:39,918
好了汉弗莱 我有权利知道
I've a right to know.

378
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:42,680
这段对话是说
Well, it was to the effect that,

379
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:46,805
考虑到您的职责定位暧昧不明
in view of the nebulous and inexplicit nature of your remit,

380
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:52,643
您在中心政治决策过程中 据信通常施加
arguably peripheral nature of your influence on decisions

381
00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:54,876
边缘化和外围的影响
within the political process,

382
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,322
他们重新调整了行动优先性
there could be a case for restructuring their action priorities

383
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:03,480
将您从近期议程中剔除了
so as to eliminate your liquidation from their agenda.

384
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:07,201
他们这样说吗?
They said that?

385
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:09,880
这是中心思想
That was the gist of it.

386
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:13,642
什么意思? 说人话
What's it mean in English?

387
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:20,200
就是说 他们觉得您不够重要
It means that they don't think you're important enough

388
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:23,438
不值得暗杀
for it to be worth assassinating you.

389
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:33,405
哦
Oh

390
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:38,558
当然 我不同意      你是说...
I don't agree, of course. You mean...?

391
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,557
什么?
What?

392
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:44,082
他们应该暗杀我?      不 不 不
They should assassinate me? No, no, no

393
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:48,000
你也觉得我不重要?      不 不
I'm not important enough? No, no...

394
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,680
我是说 您很重要
I mean you are important enough,

395
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:54,122
但还是不杀为好
but they shouldn't assassinate you anyway.

396
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:58,880
太好了 反正我也没担心过      当然 大臣
That's marvellous. Not that I was ever worried.

397
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:02,883
福勒先生问还要多久
Mr Fowler's waiting.

398
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:05,480
对 请他进来
Yes, bring him in.

399
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:09,480
伯纳 请愿书还在吗? 在就给福勒先生看看
Have we still got that petition? If so, show Mr Fowler.

400
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,000
请愿书? 但您说...
The petition? But you said...

401
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,515
对 我说过 伯纳 还是拿进来吧
Yes, I did, but bring it in.

402
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:19,122
发展的眼光 伯纳      对对 没错
Antennae, Bernard. Yes Yes, indeed.

403
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:22,358
您是要把请愿书...      对了 伯纳
The petition you were pleased...? That's right.

404
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,403
天哪
God

405
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:28,682
吉姆 你得在报上表态      当然
The paper must have an answer.  Of course.

406
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:32,043
就这么说 我热烈欢迎这些请愿书
I want you to know I welcome this petition warmly

407
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:37,564
它可不能掩盖起来
It's not the sort of thing you can sweep under the carpet

408
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:41,275
至于死亡名单 大臣牺牲无所谓
As for death lists, well, Ministers are dispensable,

409
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:44,722
自由是无价之宝 对吧 汉弗莱?
but freedom is indivisible, right, Humphrey?

410
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:46,877
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.

411
