00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:06,453
大家好 我是Sheldon Cooper博士
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:11,257
欢迎收看Sheldon Cooper主持的旗乐无穷
And welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags,

3
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:13,460
今天给您带来的是最后一集 旗观
the Final Episode Flagtacular.

4
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:18,111
我知道有这个特效 不过还是有点怕呢
I knew it was coming. Still scary.

5
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:21,451
我知道你们现在一定在想 "最后一期?
Now, I'm sure you're thinking, "The final episode?

6
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:24,721
那以后谁来带领我们走出对国旗的无知呢“
Who will stand between us and flag ignorance"

7
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:26,954
对啊 我就是这么想的
I know I was thinking that.

8
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:30,106
这个节目是讲国旗的还是读心的?
Is this a show on flags or mind reading?

9
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:33,908
我做出这个决定是因为 我无法同时做一份全职工作
But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career,

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,644
主持一档广受欢迎的网络节目 并对付一个女朋友
a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.

11
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:41,515
告诉你们这些喷子 他真的有女朋友
And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.

12
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:45,052
正如人们所说的那样 再美好的事情也有结束的一天
So as they say, all good things must come to an end.

13
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:48,355
我们在短短232期节目之后就要说再见了
After only 232 episodes.

14
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,691
其实算上某人忘记按下录像键的那次
233 if we include the one

15
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:53,994
应该一共有233期的
somebody forgot to press record on.

16
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:55,980
你说你不会再提了
You said you weren't gonna bring that up.

17
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,131
你还说你按录像键了呢
And you said you pressed record.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,102
这些都不重要 请大家放松心情
Anyway, please sit back, relax,

19
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,156
和我们共同享受这个节目的最后一段旅程...
and join us as we take our final lap...

20
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,360
挥动的竞赛用旗也是在告诉大家这是最后一次了
as indicated by the waving of this racing flag.

21
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:12,196
当然 白色的旗子也可以用来代表投降
And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender,

22
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,082
刚铎的首相 还有日本源氏部落
the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan,

23
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,668
不过第六十二期节目里面也讲过了
but I'm sure you remember that from episode 62,

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,872
“白色旗帜: 谁的白旗在挥及为什么在挥”
"White Flags: Who's Waving Them and Why"

25
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,457
那期特别好
That was a good one.

26
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,608
简直太棒了
It was so good.

27
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:30,014
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

28
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:33,300
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! * 

29
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,969
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

30
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,688
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

31
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,191
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

32
00:01:40,193 --> 00:01:42,910
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

33
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,812
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

34
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,480
生活大爆炸 第八季第10集

38
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,704
我还以为收拾一个去世的教授的办公室
You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor's office

39
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:00,037
仅仅是会比较无聊
was gonna just be boring,

40
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,373
可是我看到了他的假牙
but then I found his dentures

41
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,542
就发现这件事还有点恶心
and realized it's also gross.

42
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:10,257
Abbott教授的家人不想留着这些吗?
Doesn't Professor Abbott's family want any of this stuff?

43
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,341
他好像没有家人
I don't think he had a family.

44
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:12,926
- 好惨啊  - 我知道
- That's rough.  - I know.

45
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:14,561
你可以工作一辈子
You can spend your whole life working,

46
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:17,764
到最后剩下的不过是这个箱子里的一堆纸
and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box.

47
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:20,767
这种事真的会让人想很多
Makes you think.

48
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,520
管他呢
Oh, well.

49
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:25,856
嘿 嘿 我们应该先检查一下这些东西
Hey. Hey, we're supposed to look through all this stuff

50
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,774
然后再扔的 万一有重要的资料呢
before we throw it away in case it's important.

51
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:30,744
我... 我检查过了 都是过时的或者被证伪的理论
I... I did. It's all outdated or disproved.

52
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:33,830
可能吧 不过这支钢笔证明了重力
I don't know. This old pen kind of proves gravity.

53
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:37,117
倒过来的时候 这个女人身上的泳衣就会脱下来
When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.

54
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,251
哇哦
Oh,

55
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:40,253
我老爸也有一根这样的钢笔
my dad used to have a pen like that.

56
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:43,623
是我小学前六年的约会对象呢
I dated it all through sixth grade.

57
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,674
就这样扔掉他的东西
It still feels weird

58
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:46,960
感觉还是怪怪的
just throwing away his work like this.

59
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:48,094
别这样 总有一天
Don't feel bad. Someday,

60
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:50,847
也会有人把你的心血扔掉的
someone will be throwing out your work, too.

61
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,385
那个人就是Sheldon 那一天就是昨天
That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday.

62
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:58,638
嘿 看这个啊
Hey, look at this.

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,892
"亲爱的Roger 在你有重大发现的时候打开这瓶酒吧
"Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery.

64
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:03,977
爱你的 妈妈"
Love, Mom."

65
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,779
哇 你看这个日期
Wow, look at the date.

66
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:09,149
他存了五十年却从来没能打开这瓶酒
He saved this 50 years and never got to open it.

67
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,568
好悲伤
That's intense.

68
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,487
可怜的Roger Abbott
Poor Roger Abbott.

69
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,125
Roger Abbott念起来有点像兔子罗杰(卡通人物)
Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.

70
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:23,079
Roger Abbott Roger Abbott 好像真有点像
Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.

71
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:26,666
天啊 Leonard 我知道他去世了 但是你试试 真的好好玩!
Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he's dead, but try it. It's fun!

72
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,135
Roger Abbott 兔子罗杰 真的啊...
Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott...

73
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:32,639
嘿 Penny!
Penny!

74
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:35,342
年度销售之星啊
Oh, my rookie of the year.

75
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:37,978
哦 Dan 你当初还不想雇我来着
Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,180
现在抱我都抱不够
and now's a little hug machine. 

77
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:41,815
哦 看看你 一个新来的
Oh, look at you. Brand-new

78
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:44,100
就已经是业绩第三的销售了
and already the third best sales rep. 

79
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:45,852
- 你来坐在我这边吧  - 好啊
- Why don't you come over to my table.  - Yes.

80
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,854
我一会就过去 Bernadette正在停车呢
I'll be right there. Bernadette's just parking the car.

81
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:50,857
哦 这样啊
Oh, good.

82
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:53,526
Bernadette 可爱的 讨人喜欢的...
Bernadette. Cute, sweet...

83
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:55,495
邪恶的小Bernadette
vicious little Bernadette.

84
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:57,697
别这样 她没那么可怕
Come on. She's not that bad.

85
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,032
哦 是吗?
Oh, yeah?

86
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:01,251
公司野餐的时候 她朝我和我孙子开启了咆哮模式
At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson

87
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:03,420
就因为我们输了两人三足跑比赛
for losing the three-legged race.

88
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:08,592
我孙子现在还是叫她 "童颜巨乳刻薄妹"
I mean, he still calls her "that mean kid with the big boobies."

89
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:11,044
我知道她比较强势 但是 我发誓
I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear,

90
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:13,513
- 她人很好的 只要你无视那些...  - 嘿
- she is so sweet once you get past all the...  - Hey,

91
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:14,681
你们在说啥呢?
what are you talking about?

92
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,049
噢 我们在说
Oh. We were just talking

93
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,218
我们多爱和你一起工作 是不是啊?
about how much we love working with you. Isn't that right?

94
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,437
Dan呢?
Dan?

95
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:25,809
录制了这么多年的"旗乐无穷"
Over the years here at Fun With Flags,

96
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,346
我们学过 笑过 好奇过...
we've had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder...

97
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:33,216
是的 还掉过眼泪
And, yes, even shed a tear or two.

98
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:36,886
比如说你做了个两小时的国庆豪华版特别节目
Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular

99
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:39,856
还没被录下来的时候
and it doesn't get recorded.

100
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:42,892
我要说多少次对不起才行?
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

101
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:45,862
4000次咋样?
How about 4,000?

102
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:48,915
对我用来搭美国国旗的每块多米诺骨牌 道歉 
One for every domino I set up to make that American flag.

103
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:53,286
请欣赏以下集锦
Please enjoy these highlights.

104
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,974
矮油! 今天我们有啥旗帜?
Crikey! What flag do we have today?

105
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,647
澳大利亚国旗 伙计!
Australia, mate!

106
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:11,404
接下来是竞速猜环节 "是不是旗帜"
And now it's time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.

107
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:14,190
斯 斯
Flag. Flag.

108
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,242
不斯 斯
Not a flag. Flag.

109
00:05:16,244 --> 00:05:18,912
哥玩这个真是超神了
I am crushing this.

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,003
贝琪・罗斯女士 你在忙什么呢?
Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?

111
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:30,623
伦家也不知道
I have no idea.

112
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:34,094
因为伦家缝制第一个美国国旗的故事
Because the story of me sewing the first American flag

113
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:37,130
完全就是无凭无据的瞎扯淡呢
is unsupported poppycock.

114
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:39,966
那是谁缝制的呢 嗯?
Then who did sew it, hmm?

115
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,685
不要问我
Don't ask me.

116
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:45,121
我只是个出来赚外快的...
I'm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are...

117
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:48,525
裁缝后代!
out to make a quick buck!

118
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:56,866
想游泳吗 亲爱的?
Fancy a dip, my dear?

119
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:58,485
想啊
I do.

120
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:03,239
等等 那个紫色旗帜代表
Wait, that purple flag indicates

121
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,909
有海洋有害生物出没 比如水母
that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.

122
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:09,245
哇 那个旗帜真是能救命
Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.

123
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:11,581
不
No.

124
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,800
这才是
This is.

125
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,470
别盯着我腿看了
Stop looking at my legs.

126
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,840
不斯 斯的
Not a flag. Flag.

127
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:23,176
斯的 不斯
Flag. Not a flag.

128
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,844
斯的
Flag.

129
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,680
该死
Crap.

130
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,350
当一些东西让我消沉的时候
When stuff like this gets me down,

131
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,684
你知道我都怎么做吗?
you know what I like to do?

132
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:34,687
和一个八岁萝莉一样 唱"哈库那玛塔塔"? 
Sing "Hakuna Matata" like an eight-year-old girl?

133
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:34,687
{\an8}"狮子王"插曲 动画片"丁满和彭彭"的主题曲

134
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,523
不对 机灵鬼
Wrong, smarty-pants.

135
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:40,243
是"乐高大电影"里的"一切都超赞"
It's "Everything Is Awesome" from The Lego Movie.

136
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,113
看看这些笔记本
Look at these notebooks.

137
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,165
满页都是数据
They're full of pages and pages of data.

138
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,866
肯定是他好多年心血
He clearly spent years on this.

139
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:49,702
嗯 这只是一列列随机数 扔吧
Mmm. Oh, it's just columns of random numbers. Toss it.

140
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:52,639
但是 万一这里面就藏着他潜在的成就呢?
Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him?

141
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,290
假如... 假如这就是
What if... what if this is the thing

142
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:56,976
让他打开那瓶香槟的契机呢?
that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne?

143
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:59,295
也许他找不到可以配那瓶香槟的东西
Maybe he didn't know what to pair champagne with.

144
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:03,183
草莓 鱼子酱 牡蛎 都是不错的选择
Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices.

145
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:05,885
是的 就你那表情
Yeah, that look right there

146
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:09,322
怪不得大家去你家聚会前都得自己填饱肚子
is why people eat before they come to your parties.

147
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,357
这一定意味着什么
This has to mean something.

148
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,478
看不到可辨别的模型
Well, there's no discernible pattern that I can see,

149
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,864
但是把数字输进去检查应该不难
but it shouldn't be too hard to run the numbers and check.

150
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,483
也许下次可以放到超级计算机上试试
Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.

151
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:22,402
是啊 可以试试多元回归分析
Sure. We could try multiple regressions

152
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:24,904
用不同的物理和试验常数试试
with varying physical and experimental constants.

153
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:27,490
哦 我们可以对知名的待解决物理难题
Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm

154
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:29,626
跑一遍模式匹配算法
against well-known unsolved physics problems.

155
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:32,078
哦 这可能是个替换式密码
Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher.

156
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
我们可以先用基本的"密分"
We could start with basic cryptanalysis.

157
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:37,767
或者问问这个和他一个办公室的人
Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.

158
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:42,172
好吧 去问问
Oh, let's do that.

159
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:44,724
因为你不知道怎么"密码分析" 是不是?
Because you don't know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?

160
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:47,227
我都不知道是不是叫密分
I'm not even sure if it's the right word.

161
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:55,935
那么
So,

162
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:58,588
Dan 你有个孙子啊 他多大了?
Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?

163
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,989
- 七岁  - 哦 是的
- Seven.  - Oh, yeah.

164
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,941
我记得他 一起野餐过
I remember him from the picnic.

165
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:05,912
他是那个一直哭的孬种
He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.

166
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,283
我听说他被一个贱小孩给骂了
I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.

167
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:11,684
越挫越勇
Just builds character.

168
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:13,670
就像我爸说的那样 "没人喜欢爱哭鬼
Like my dad said, "Nobody likes a crybaby

169
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:16,155
除了亲娘和民主党们"
except their mommies and Democrats."

170
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,374
我得再续一杯
I need another drink.

171
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:22,262
- 他怎么了?  - 哦
- What's his problem?  - Oh.

172
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,097
不知道 也许他不喜欢
I don't know. Maybe he didn't like the fact
169	

173
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:25,882
你把他的孙子叫成孬种
that you called his grandson a wuss.

174
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:29,102
好吧 不是不能说"娘娘腔"这个词了吗
Well, I didn't think you were supposed to say "sissy" anymore.

175
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:32,639
听着 我知道你是个好人
Okay, look, I know what a good person you are,

176
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:36,059
但是有些人觉得你有点太冲了
but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.

177
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:37,143
什么?
What?

178
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:39,729
我是我所知道的最可爱的人
I'm, like, the sweetest person I know.

179
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:44,817
看着我 我该坐在树洞里烤饼干
Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.

180
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:46,819
是的 但是偶尔
Yes, but once in a while,

181
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:50,123
有些人觉得你有点刻薄
people think you're a little mean.

182
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,357
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

183
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:53,126
你也这么觉得?
You one of those people?

184
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,828
不 不 不 不
No. No, no, no.

185
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,798
我...我觉得你该烤饼干
I...I think the cookie thing.

186
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,337
开拍
Action.

187
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:05,972
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

188
00:09:05,974 --> 00:09:08,708
我们今天的客人是个回归的人气王
Our guest today is a returning fan favorite.

189
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,077
是他成就了Reading Rainbow
He puts the reading in your rainbow,

190
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,612
星际迷航里的Geordi La Forge
the Geordi in your La Forge,

191
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:14,547
还有Roots里的Kunta Kinte
and the Kunta in your Kinte,

192
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,733
他就是LeVar Burton先生
Mr. LeVar Burton.

193
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:23,690
谢谢 Sheldon 不要忘了我们的约定...
Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal...

194
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:28,161
等这个拍完了 我就把你的联系方式删掉
You do this, I delete your contact information.

195
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:29,279
而且...
While...

196
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,364
而且当场删给你看
While you watch me do it.

197
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:33,366
太棒了 能回来我很高兴
Great. Happy to be back.

198
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,001
既然你在这里
Well, since you're here,

199
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:37,470
我想请教一下你对一件事的看法
I'd like to get your opinion on something.

200
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:39,539
为了庆祝黑人历史月
In honor of Black History Month,

201
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,541
我在一段致敬视频里饰演了卡弗
I portrayed George Washington Carver

202
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:46,179
但被我的室友说成"极端的种族歧视"
in a loving tribute that my roommate called "wildly racist"

203
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:48,214
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

204
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:50,483
你好 我叫George
Hi. My name is George.

205
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:52,652
哦 天哪不是吧!
Oh, hell, no!

206
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:57,173
你听到他说的了 Leonard
You heard him, Leonard.

207
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,359
不是 这不是种族歧视
No, it's not racist.

208
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,142
真的是在这里吗?
Are we sure this is the place?

209
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:13,226
看门的人说就是这幢楼
The doorman said this is the right building.

210
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,743
我觉得在吊裤子的人
I think if you're pulling up your pants,

211
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:17,530
不太像是看门人吧
you're not a doorman.

212
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:18,981
谁啊?
Who is it?

213
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:21,117
Sharpe教授在吗?
Uh, I'm looking for a Professor Sharpe?

214
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:24,037
等等
Hold on.

215
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,294
- 怎么了?  - 嗨
- Can I help you?  - Hi.

216
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,471
我们是大学里来的 我们想了解一下
We're from the university. We're trying to get some information

217
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:28,923
Abbott教授
about Professor Abbott.

218
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:30,339
我们在打扫他的办公室的时候
We were cleaning out his office

219
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,091
找到了这些写满了数字的本子
and found these books full of numbers.

220
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,726
你知道那是什么吗?
Any chance you know what it is?

221
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,511
知道 他总是在研究这个 哦
Yes, he was always working on this. Oh.

222
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:36,851
我想这个可能是
I was thinking it might be

223
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:38,594
某种星际坐标系统
some sort of interstellar coordinate system,

224
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:40,635
也有可能是一个升级版的哈勃定律
maybe an updated version of Hubble's law.

225
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:43,117
我看到90这个数字一直在重复
I keep seeing the number 90 repeating.

226
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,761
这可能是一个遥远星系的
That could be the angle of perturbation

227
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,025
摄动角度
of a distant galaxy.

228
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,826
这是一杯酸奶的卡路里值
It's the number of calories in a yogurt.

229
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:50,911
这是他的进食日记
That's his food diary.

230
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:52,363
真的?
Really?

231
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,198
是的 他不管吃了什么都写下来
Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate.

232
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,417
他相信控制卡路里摄入量
He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key

233
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:57,835
是永生的关键
to living forever.

234
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:59,503
有用吗?
Does it work?

235
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:00,921
你逗我呢?
Seriously?

236
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:03,841
他可能是被公交车撞死的 你怎么知道
Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don't know.

237
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,044
真是对不起 这东西那么无趣
Sorry it's not more interesting.

238
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:09,130
看开点 你不需要
On the bright side, you didn't have to listen

239
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,882
听他肚子咕咕叫35年
to his stomach growl for 35 years.

240
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:14,185
Abbott教授有没有研究过什么
So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on

241
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:17,138
真的能有点成果的东西?
during his life that came close to an accomplishment?

242
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,608
老实说 他的研究从来没成什么大气
To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.

243
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,693
哦 你曾经是他的同事
Oh. You were his colleague.

244
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:23,694
你的研究怎么样?
How did your research turn out?

245
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,729
很棒 嘿 得了诺贝尔奖
Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get

246
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,898
才能买得起这种公寓
when you win a Nobel.

247
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,985
你可以再节省一点的
Well, you could be very frugal.

248
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:33,404
我已经有点受够了大家的反话了
I'm getting a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.

249
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:38,965
我不欺负人的
I'm not a bully.

250
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,049
我是说 也许我看上去很强势
I mean, maybe I come off a little strong,

251
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:43,051
那只是因为我爸爸从小就让我坚强
but that's only because my dad raised me to be tough

252
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,636
不受任何人的侮辱
and not to take crap from anybody.

253
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,849
那也没关系 但是坚强不等于告诉你的朋友
No. That's fine, but there's a difference between being tough

254
00:11:47,849 --> 00:11:51,217
她的新裤子看起来就像松垮的尿不湿
and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.

255
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,388
我真那么说了 好像?
I did say that, didn't I?

256
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,689
是的 你说了
Yeah, you did.

257
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:59,609
我感到很没面子 不得不把裤子退了
I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.

258
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:02,562
退哪儿去了? 孕婴店吗?
Where? To Babies R Us?

259
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:05,231
你又来了!
You're doing it again!

260
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,616
真对不起 我们走行吗?
Okay, sorry. Can we just go?

261
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:08,067
我感觉每个人都讨厌我
I feel like everybody hates me.

262
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,069
别瞎想 他们不讨厌你 知道吗?
Oh, come on, they don't hate you, all right?

263
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,237
他们就是有点儿怕你
They're just a little intimidated.

264
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,789
你只要让他们看到真实的你
All you need to do is show everyone

265
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,956
有多善良就行了
how sweet you really are.

266
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,958
- 我还是想走  - 不 别走
- I think I'd rather go.  - No, come on.

267
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,235
你哪儿也不能去 知道吗?
You are not going anywhere, all right?

268
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,912
我在这陪着你 咱们一起解决这个问题
I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.

269
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:21,330
谢谢你
Thank you.

270
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,249
尽管你穿的裙子很丑
Even though your dress is ugly.

271
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:28,488
好啦 我可爱的旗友们
Well, my little Flag-keteers,

272
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,492
看来我们最后一期"旗乐无穷"要接近尾声了
it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end.

273
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:34,393
我真的很希望
If I could,

274
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:38,481
我能把每一个观众都升到旗杆子上
I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole

275
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:41,400
然后向你们敬礼
and salute you.

276
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:43,886
如果你们落在了地上 就烧了你们
And if you touched the ground, burn you.

277
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:43,886
{\an8}据传言说美国国旗如果碰到地面就要被烧毁

278
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:46,906
我还要以我个人的名义
I'd like to take a moment

279
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:49,075
感谢Amy Farrah Fowler博士
to personally thank Dr.Amy Farrah Fowler,

280
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:51,060
你们可能不知道
who you may or may not know

281
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:55,431
她是第一个协助主持了国旗或旗帜类
is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related

282
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:58,284
网络娱乐资讯节目的女人
Internet info-tainment show.

283
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:00,753
男权 统统滚一边
Take that, glass ceiling.

284
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:06,425
接下来说点儿正经的
And if I may get serious for a moment,

285
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:10,379
主持这个节目就像是一次...
hosting this show has been...

286
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:12,598
不平凡的旅程
one crazy ride.

287
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,302
尽管经历了很多挫折
With all its ups and downs,

288
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,188
可我无论如何都不会放弃
I wouldn't give it up for the world.

289
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,808
除了现在 我正要放弃
Except for now, when I'm giving it up.

290
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:28,447
在节目结束之前 我想...
Before I sign off, I'd, uh...

291
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:32,852
我想跟你们所有人分享白旗的最后一个用法
I'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag.

292
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:36,856
这种时刻用起来刚好
It's good for times like this.

293
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:41,661
晚安
Good night.

294
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:42,895
切
Cut.

295
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:47,300
噢Sheldon...
Sheldon...

296
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:49,468
太感人了
that was beautiful.

297
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,636
如果你没按录像键...
If you didn't press record...

298
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:52,805
老娘按了!
I pressed it!

299
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:59,929
结束了
Well, that's it.

300
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:02,648
Roger Abbott就这样收场了
That's the end of Roger Abbott.

301
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:07,520
而我们还不知道他有什么成就
And we still don't know who framed him.

302
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,657
我还是在想
I still keep thinking

303
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:14,243
人这一辈子看起来怎么那么一事无成
about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.

304
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:17,559
我觉得令人悲伤的现实是
I guess the sad truth is,

305
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,739
不是所有的人都会有所成就
not everyone will accomplish something great.

306
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,234
我们中的一些人
Some of us

307
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:24,217
也许只能从生命中的平凡时刻
may just have to find meaning

308
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,804
去寻找生命的意义了
in the little moments that make up life.

309
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:30,891
这种想法也不错
That's a nice way of looking at it.

310
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:32,893
对你是不错 不适用于我
Yeah for you, not for me.

311
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:34,945
哥儿已经上过太空了 跟你不一样
I went to space. I'm covered.

312
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,232
猜我想到了什么?
You know what?

313
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:42,402
这瓶香槟是用来庆祝成就的
This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement.

314
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:43,787
咱们来做个约定
Let's make a pact.

315
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,072
我们当中有人实现了第一个重大成就的时候
When one of us gets their first big breakthrough,

316
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:48,742
我们就打开这瓶香槟来庆祝
we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne

317
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:50,744
并向Abbott祝酒
and toasting Professor Abbott.

318
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:51,912
好主意
I love that.

319
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:52,996
好主意
Yeah, me, too.

320
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:54,798
当然还要
Then, of course,

321
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,583
拿我们的成就 喷Sheldon一脸
rubbing our success in Sheldon's face.

322
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,919
- 噢 那才是最棒的  - 对
- Oh, well, that's the best part.  - Oh, yeah.

323
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:03,590
Dan 我能跟你聊几句吗?
Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?

324
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:08,762
可以 说吧
Sure, go ahead.

325
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,514
我想让你知道我并不是有意
Just want you to know I didn't mean

326
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:11,765
对你的外孙那么没礼貌的
to be rude about your grandson.

327
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,433
没关系
No, it's okay.

328
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:15,318
不 有关系
No, it's not.

329
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,903
Penny 告诉我大家都怕我了
Penny told me that everyone's scared of me.

330
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:19,156
啊? 啥?
What? What?

331
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:21,057
你说那些干什么?
Why would she say that?

332
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,742
你知道她喝多了 对吧?
You know she drinks, right?

333
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:24,661
怎么会?
What?

334
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:27,080
没有 她说得对 我想告诉你
No, she's right, and I just want you to know

335
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:29,449
从现在开始 我要更在乎大家的感受
that from now on, I'm gonna be much more sensitive.

336
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:31,501
我不想让大家在我面前都如履薄冰
I don't want anyone walking on eggshells around me.

337
00:15:31,503 --> 00:15:34,037
哦 呃 好吧 那么
Oh, well, okay, then, uh,

338
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,956
有件事我一直想要告诉你
one thing I've been meaning to tell you

339
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,792
公司不再为我们提供咖啡了
is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.

340
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:40,677
没问题 什么时候开始啊?
No problem. When does that start?

341
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,829
五个月前
Five months ago.

342
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:44,097
- 什么?!  - 是的
- What?!  - Yeah.

343
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:45,799
那是谁一直再为我咖啡买单?
Who's been paying for my coffee?

344
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:46,800
我们所有人
All of us.

345
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,501
是啊 钱是从脏话罐里面拿的
Yeah. It comes from the swear jar

346
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:50,270
每一次你骂人我们就往脏话罐里投钱
we put money in when you curse.

347
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:55,192
还有什么是我不知道的?
What else don't I know about?

348
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:58,028
呃 你知道你有个私人洗手间是吧?
Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?

349
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,480
- 怎么了?  - 那是给整层楼的人用的
- Yeah?  - That was supposed to be for the whole floor.

350
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,616
- 你开玩笑的吧  - 不 不
- You're kidding.  - No, no.

351
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:05,068
没关系的 这只是对轮椅姐Kathy来说不方便而已
It's okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy,

352
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,454
她又回到医院去了
and she's back in the hospital now,

353
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,456
所以事情都解决了
so it all worked out.

354
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,659
- 我感觉很内疚啊  - 是啊
- I feel so bad.  - Yeah.

355
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:13,695
你也许不应该
Well, then, maybe you shouldn't have

356
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:15,829
给她取"轮椅姐Kathy"这个绰号
named her "Wheelchair Kathy."

357
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:18,798
哦 天啊!
Oh, my God!

358
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,252
我以为每个人都很喜欢我 但我却是一个怪兽
I thought everybody liked me, but I'm just a monster.

359
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:26,139
但你是可爱的那种 怪兽公司里面独眼的那个家伙一样
But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.

360
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:28,808
不 我糟透了
No, I'm the worst.

361
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,477
我是个糟糕的人
I'm a terrible person.

362
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,929
好了 别哭 没关系的
Come on, don't cry. It's okay.

363
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:34,180
有关系
It's not okay.

364
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:36,850
- 我怎么还能在这继续工作呢  - 哦
- How can I even work here anymore?  - Oh.

365
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,485
- 因为这个公司需要你啊  - 没事的
- Because this company needs you.  - It's fine.

366
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,203
我们不介意为你的咖啡买单
We don't mind paying for the coffee.

367
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:42,606
我不能让你们这样做
I can't let you do that.

368
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,241
也许我们能
Maybe we could get you

369
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:46,493
弄台意大利特浓咖啡机放在你办公室
an espresso machine for your office.

370
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:48,528
那真是极好的
I guess that would be all right.

371
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,530
好吧
All right.

372
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,916
看到没? 
See? You don't have

373
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:54,501
你不需要说刻薄的话来得到你想要的东西
to be mean to get what you want.

374
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:56,536
你说得对
You're right.

375
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:59,372
那关于我私人洗手间的事怎么说呢?
Now where did we land on my bathroom?

376
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,528
嘿
Hey.

377
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,713
你好
Hello.

378
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:08,064
怎么这么晚还不睡?
How come you're up so late?

379
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,966
几个小时前
I posted the last episode

380
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,002
我上传了旗乐无穷最终集
of Fun with Flags hours ago,

381
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:14,771
现在一个评论都没收到
and not a single person cared enough to comment.

382
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,908
所有的功夫都白费了
All that effort for nothing.

383
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,894
嗯 我懂你的感受
Mm. I know how you feel.

384
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:23,613
我今天去把一个人所有的研究工作都扔掉了
I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career,

385
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:25,448
只剩下了一瓶上了年头的香槟
and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne

386
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,817
还有Raj以为我们没看到他偷偷拿了的
and a naked lady pen that Raj took

387
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,403
那只裸体女人模样的笔
when he thought no one was looking.

388
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:33,239
这不是一回事
It's not the same thing.

389
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:35,909
我觉得你一点都不懂我的感受
I don't think you know how I feel at all.

390
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:38,411
你觉得很难过?
Sad?

391
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:41,581
嗯 你还真懂我
Hmm. You do get me.

392
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,586
有人评论了
Someone left a comment.

393
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:47,887
是吗 他们怎么说?
Yeah. What did they say?

394
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,889
"很遗憾你的节目完结了
"Too bad your show is done.

395
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:51,891
我还挺喜欢的"
I kind of liked it."

396
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,094
Leonard 你听到了没?
Leonard, did you hear that?

397
00:17:55,262 --> 00:17:57,430
哦 人们的心都要碎了呀!
Oh, the people are heartbroken!

398
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:01,818
我不能让这节目在这世界上消失!
I can't take this away from the world!

399
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,771
旗乐无穷回归了!
Fun with Flags is back!

400
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:06,773
恭喜啊
Congratulations.

401
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:08,608
让我们庆祝吧!
Let's celebrate!

402
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:12,829
Sheldon啊
Sheldon,

403
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:14,531
这不是留给你的啊!
that wasn't for you!

404
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:16,082
哦 不 我不打算喝它
Oh, no, I'm not going to drink it.

405
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:17,584
我只是想听盖子打开的时候嘭的一声
I just wanted to hear the pop.

406
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:22,122
我知道会它会响 但心里还是怕怕的呢
Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.

407
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:35,920
喂 LeVar Burton?
LeVar Burton?

408
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,703
喂 LeVar Burton!
LeVar Burton!

409
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:39,288
喂 LeVar Burton!
LeVar Burton!

410
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,841
啊 你在这干嘛?
Ugh. What are you doing here?

411
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,193
你说我不能打电话
You told me not to call,

412
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,628
我觉得没有别的办法把这个好消息告诉你了
and I didn't know how else to give you the good news.

413
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,299
旗乐无穷回归了 你可以出现在下一集里了
Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.

414
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:51,717
Wil Wheaton告诉我得装个大铁门
Wil Wheaton said, get a gate.

415
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,303
- 我不知道为什么我偏没有装大铁门  - 你...
- I don't know why I didn't get a gate.  - You...

416
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:56,772
至少先听听我的提议
At least listen to the premise.

417
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:58,307
既然你是在德国出生的
Since you were born in Germany,

418
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,276
我觉得我们能谈论一下德国的旗子
I thought we could talk about German flags.

419
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:04,855
不如你打扮成像个纳粹的样子好不好?
How do you feel about dressing up like a swastika?
