344
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,870
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

345
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,497
You don't have to be fine.

346
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,999
Something terrible
just happened. Let me help you.

347
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,419
You don't need to help me with
this. We barely know each other.

348
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,714
Okay. But, um, we just...

349
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,924
Had sex?

350
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,342
Uh, yes, we just had sex.

351
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,721
But that doesn't mean
we know each other.

352
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,141
You're right. I'm sorry.

353
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,687
Honestly, I-I think
you should just go.

354
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,897
Oh. Okay.

355
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,108
Let me just...

356
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,320

359
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,834
If you are game
for an adventure,

360
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,837
I have tickets
to this show at BAM.

361
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,798
[Robbie] What happened?

362
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,678
Uh, my-my... my dad's in a coma.

363
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,930
They don't, they don't know
what's gonna happen,

364
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,807
but I-I should... [sniffles]

365
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,059
I should get home
as soon as possible.

366
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,312
Yeah, okay. Um, how can I help?

367
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,356
[clears throat] Uh,
what about a-a plane ticket?

368
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,483
'Cause I-I can arrange that.

369
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,026
Just-just show me
where your, um,

370
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,194
show me where your computer is
and your credit card

371
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,071
and-and I-I'll just
book you a ticket.

372
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,699
And you can pack. Or, uh,
do you want to take a shower?

373
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,535
Are you-you hungry? 'Cause
I could, I could get something

374
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,871
- and...
- That-that is very sweet
of you, thank you.

375
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,792
Come here. I'm so sorry.

376
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,046
Okay.

377
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,381
I'm sorry, did I,
did I do something wrong?

378
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,219
No, no, not at all.
I just, uh...

379
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,016
I am gonna hop
in the shower, actually.

380
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,392
That's a, that's a good idea.

381
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,852
Good, good. Just show me
where your computer is

382
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,354
and I'll-I'll book you a ticket.

383
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,940
Robbie.

384
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,650
[chuckles] I will handle that.

385
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,777
We just had
this great night tonight

386
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,986
and now this terrible thing
has happened,

387
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,322
so just let me help you
somehow, please.

388
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,115
I...

389
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,202
I had a great time tonight.

390
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,538
And you're right, something...

391
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,374
really terrible did just happen.

392
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,878
So what would be most helpful to
me is if you would just leave.

393
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,882
Please.
