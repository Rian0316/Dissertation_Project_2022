she of mystical blood,
the doppelganger Tatia?

No. I'm afraid loki the pig
is fated to be food...

myself on a pyre

noble and gentle.

change after all.

drained her body of blood...

all the wrong friends,

But you're not gonna
do that, are you,

blonde friend

150

Did you have to do that?

180
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:31,461
I despise voice mail.

181
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:33,263
Do you have the white oak stake?

182
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,735
Hit a bit of a snag, truthfully.

183
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:37,974
Is that what you would
like for me to pass along?

184
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:41,741
Tell her that I've got
everything under control.

185
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,342
I'm keeping an eye on Davina.

186
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,612
She's working on a spell
to unlink her mates

187
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,550
from Klaus' sire lines
so that she can kill him

188
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:50,619
without them dying, too.

189
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,356
I'm sure the stake will
come back into play

190
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:54,824
when she's ready.

191
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:57,394
How close is she
to completing the spell?

192
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:58,963
Well, she's joined
mother's linking

193
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:01,467
and sire bond spells in reverse.

194
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:02,868
Quite clever, really.

195
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:05,237
Huh. What's she using
as a binder?

196
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:06,840
I'm not sure.

197
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:08,610
Still trying to work
that one out.

198
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,346
Work harder.

199
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:12,616
Mother needs Klaus
alive and connected.

200
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:15,983
So may I suggest that if
you can't find that stake,

201
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:19,219
you either kill the girl's
spell or you kill that girl.

202
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:24,095
Klaus will find you.

203
00:11:24,096 --> 00:11:27,331
Oh, he will, but
I will be ready.

204
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,302
How? I've seen the kind
of pain that blade causes.

205
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:35,176
I have fought through more pain
than anyone living or dead,

206
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:39,916
but once I feed,
I shall be restored.

207
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:42,822
Not on you.

208
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:47,327
You, my dear, are leverage.

209
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:50,663
Once I threaten to dismember you

210
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:52,800
in front of him, Klaus
will hesitate,

211
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:56,972
and in that moment of
weakness, I shall end him.

212
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,808
This is crazy, the two of you

213
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:01,112
going round and round
trying to kill each other.

214
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:03,014
You're obsessing over
the death of someone

215
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,786
whose fatal flaw is he was
fathered by another guy.

216
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:07,321
Hush!

217
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,922
You are the enabler of the weak.

218
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:13,594
No wonder he seeks your company.

219
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:15,196
What?

220
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:22,069
I hear music, and where
there's music, there's food.

221
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,437
[Music playing]

222
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:29,305
Aah...

223
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:35,181
Well, well, well, well.
What have we here?

224
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:39,419
Hillbilly Halloween.
How perfect.

225
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,488
[Creak]

226
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,416
Used kandahar root as a binder.

227
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:17,524
Where'd you find that?

228
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:20,025
[Speaking]

229
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:27,192
Oh...

230
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:33,302
What happened?

231
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:34,569
Davina, you're awake.

232
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,603
I was starting
to freak out. You ok?

233
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:38,874
My head.

234
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,578
Klaus?

235
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,614
Angry bloke with
the deadly aim? Yeah.

236
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,882
He smashed the place up,
and then he left.

237
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:48,184
Where'd he go?

238
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:51,190
To hunt down your
pet serial killer friend.

239
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:52,658
Listen. Not to be
Mr. judgmental here,

240
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:55,861
but I'm starting to question
the company that you keep.

241
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,596
The white oak stake?

242
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,664
It's gone, I'm afraid.

243
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:03,200
The serial killer one took it.

244
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:08,342
Mikael? Mikael.
Mikael.

245
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:10,645
Why isn't this working?

246
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:13,179
Sit... sit down, all right?

247
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,947
You were out for
quite a long time.

248
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:16,215
Maybe that's got
something to do with it.

249
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,516
Here. Have some water.
No.

250
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:18,650
You don't understand.

251
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,485
If Mikael is free,
he can kill Klaus,

252
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:23,121
and then my friends die, too.

253
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:25,221
Well, if I understand all
this, Mikael has been trying

254
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,555
to kill Klaus for eons.

255
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:28,758
How are you gonna stop him?

256
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,194
I'm not.

257
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,898
I need to finish my spell now.

00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,135
[Hayley clears throat]

259
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,839
So those werewolf kids
you helped get

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,343
out of the quarter made it
to the safe house up north.

261
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,410
Great. My good deed
for the decade.

262
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:46,742
No. I'm good.

263
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,345
Maybe the vampires
and us free wolves

264
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,046
can work together, after all.

265
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:52,718
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

266
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,623
Anyway, thanks for helping.

267
00:14:56,624 --> 00:15:00,594
Mm. Don't thank me.
Thank Elijah.

268
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,429
I would've, but I can't
get a hold of him.

269
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,364
I went to the compound
thinking he'd be there.

270
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:07,134
Really? I thought you
always had tabs on him.

271
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:11,137
We haven't really been on
the best terms lately.

272
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:12,937
He wouldn't just
disappear, though.

273
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:15,774
Last I knew, he was gonna
keep the wolves distracted.

274
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:18,211
Your boy Oliver
was gonna help him.

275
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,080
I couldn't track down
Oliver either.

276
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:24,115
If they're both missing...

277
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:28,223
Where are you going?

278
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:29,593
To find them.

279

aren't you?

It's been hours since you fed.

282
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:43,805
What an awful thing, to feed
upon the blood of others.

283
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:47,209
For this I blame myself
and your father.

you children strong,

You slaughtered 6

they were nothing at all.

special she was.

would protect her,

that she would be your wife,

You've taught yourself
to hide from who

thousands of years.

No.

the dark magic

into a monster.

359
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:35,742
You loved her.

360
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,742
No! Ugh!

361
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,343
Lenore: But you couldn't
fight what you had become,

362
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,009
what I had turned you into...

363
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,042
[Tatia gasping]

364
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,512
A predator...

365
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:49,048
And she became your prey.

366
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,184
This was you.

367
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:55,990
You murdered her
for her blood...

368
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:59,727
And then used it to cripple
Klaus for centuries.

369
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:04,834
I won't listen to another word.

370
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,667
You don't have to listen, son.

371
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:11,771
All you have to do is remember.

372
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:54,503
Did you honestly think
to hold me

373
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,238
with a blade forged for pain?

374
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,581
Unlike the weak, unlike you,
I gain strength from pain.

375
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,550
Soon you will know
the taste of white oak

376
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:04,118
as it pierces your heart.

377
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,053
Very clever, Mikael.

378
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:09,993
Compelling the locals to say
to my face what you dare not.

379
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,799
Enjoy the theatrics.

380
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,834
They only delay the inevitable.

381
00:21:16,836 --> 00:21:18,103
[Yells]

382
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:25,309
Well, perhaps we should
hold off on this.

383
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:28,047
No. I hai everything I need.

384
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,788
Combine a knotting spell
with a sire bond spell.

385
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,655
I just have to combine
them the right way.

386
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:33,990
Then do them in reverse.

387
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:37,462
That's pretty advanced
for a wee girl like you.

388
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:42,170
I can give you a list of people
who have underestimated me.

389
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:43,974
Not one of them has
done it a second time.

390
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:45,810
Well, perhaps I should help you.

391
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:47,612
I'm pretty good at
stuff like this.

392
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:50,183
I don't think so.

393
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,654
It's not just saying
spells backwards.

394
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:54,986
It's changing the verb
tense into...

395
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,954
Nemo unus animabus

396
00:21:56,955 --> 00:22:00,191
carnem et sanguinem de ista duo.

397
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:05,403
Like I said, I'm pretty.

398
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:08,170
It's never paid to
underestimate me either.

399
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:11,677
Ok. Let's do this.

400
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:20,854
Cami: I used to
try to convince Klaus

401
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,290
that there was good in everyone,

402
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,727
that you really did
care about him...

403
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,927
Deep inside once.

404
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:32,464
He told me I was naive,
that I could never fathom

405
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,937
how deep your hatred ran.

406
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,006
I didn't always hate him.

407
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:39,040
When Niklaus was born,
I was overjoyed.

408
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,841
I thought, this one...

409
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:42,945
This one has the eyes
of a warrior.

410
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,649
He will be worthy.

411
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,550
But my hope was short-lived.

412
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:49,017
And when I found out that
he wasn't really my son,

413
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:52,051
my relief was glorious!

414
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:53,754
But that passed

415
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:56,258
with the knowledge that
he was begat of a beast.

416
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,527
His mother's infidelity
was not his fault.

417
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:00,095
Everything that followed

418
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,298
was because of Niklaus'
obsession with the wolves.

419
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,268
He ventured out to watch them
turn under the full moon,

420
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,038
and he took my youngest
son, Heinrich.

421
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,775
He was but a child.

422
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:13,245
And he was torn apart.

423
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,445
An accident.

424
00:23:14,446 --> 00:23:18,380
An accident?!
He murdered my wife!

425
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:21,083
His own mother who
sought to cleanse him

426
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:23,152
of his beast-like nature.

427
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,290
He betrayed me.

428
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:30,563
He turned my entire
family against me.

429
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:33,568
And yet you defend him.

430
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:39,572
I have desperately
tried to convince him

431
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:42,278
not to kill you, that
the bloodshed

432
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,413
in your family does not have
to be an endless cycle.

433
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:48,549
And after centuries on this
earth, do you really not see

434
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,151
that all of your
violence is pointless?

435
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,785
[Laughing]

436
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:57,892
Let me hazard a guess.

437
00:23:57,893 --> 00:24:00,695
You are one of these
alienists, right?

438
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,965
We're called therapists
these days.

439
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:06,803
And to be honest, you could
do with some couch time.

440
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:09,773
Actually, my dear,
since my wound

441
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:12,075
does not appear to be healing,

442
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:16,214
what I could do with
right now is some food.

443
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:18,217
You... you said you wouldn't.

444
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:20,320
Yes, I did, didn't I?

445
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:22,192
And all of the blood of
a fawn barely makes

446
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:24,596
for good fodder.

447
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:28,631
In times of need, even
the devil eats flies.

448
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:29,897

449
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,871
Oh.

[Ring]

453
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:45,041
I'm a tad busy.
What is it, Hayley?

454
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:46,643
Something has
happened to Elijah.

455
00:24:46,644 --> 00:24:48,478
He was supposed to be
our decoy last night,

456
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,177
and now he's vanished.

457
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:52,010
There's blood everywhere...

458
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,247
Werewolf and vampire.

459
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:55,449
There is a trail.

460
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,119
I need you to help us track it.

461
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,554
Well, as much as I might
like to help you find

462
00:24:58,555 --> 00:25:02,256
my brother, I have more
pressing matters at the moment.

463
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:05,026
What's more important
than your own brother...

464
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:06,360
My life.

465
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:08,196
Davina had Mikael on
a magical leash.

466
00:25:08,197 --> 00:25:09,863
And it broke.

467
00:25:09,864 --> 00:25:13,001
Now Mikael has Tunde's
blade, the white oak stake,

468
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,270
and Cami.

469
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:16,172
I'm going to get her back.

470
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:19,407
And then I'm going to end this.

471
00:25:19,408 --> 00:25:22,240
Either Mikael or I will be
ash by night's end.

472
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:23,810
And if you do find my brother,

473
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,379
please tell him I
could do with a hand.

474
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,546

Stop! Stop.
This isn't working.

479
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,085
Well, maybe you're
just doing it wrong.

480
00:25:50,087 --> 00:25:51,820
No. We have to get this right.

481
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:54,922
Josh, Marcel, their
lives depend on it.

482
00:25:54,923 --> 00:25:56,190
Look, just stop chanting.

483
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:58,360
I'll chant and channel
your power.

484

Release me!

[Kaleb chanting]

486
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:11,738
I've been wondering when you
might make an appearance, Kol.

487
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:16,038
You're one of them.

488
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:20,939
You liar!

00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:27,975
That hurt.

00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,281
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

492
00:26:32,283 --> 00:26:33,715
You ruined a spell.

493
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:35,049
And now my friends are
gonna die because of you.

494
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,250
My mother said, kill
the spell or kill her.

495
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,085
And I happen to like you.

496
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:41,822
Oh, please.

497
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:43,057
Listen, you don't disobey
mother dearest

498
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:44,793
without some consequences.

499
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:46,661
Yes, she brought
me back to life.

500
00:26:46,663 --> 00:26:48,330
But she's mad as a hatter.

501
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,933
And that man you've made
your pet, my father,

502
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:53,235
well, he's more of
a lunatic than she is.

503
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,804
What, so you just unleash him?

504
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:56,238
You're the one who brought
him back to life first.

505
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,639
I had him under control.

506
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,207
Yeah, right up until
the point you didn't,

507
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,076
which is when he threatened me.

508
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,944
He wanted freedom,
so I freed him.

509
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:04,311
You want to know my secrets?

510
00:27:04,313 --> 00:27:06,680
Then here you go. Go on.
Have at it.

511
00:27:06,682 --> 00:27:08,282
Yes, I'm a Mikaelson.

512
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:10,118
But I've got just as much
reason to loathe

513
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,685
the lot of them as you do.

514
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:18,529
You deactivated
my bracelet. How?

515
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,130
It's a dark object.

about creating

517

All right.

520
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:31,077
You're distorting my memories.

521
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:33,278
It was you who killed Tatia.

522
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,282
Oh. I used her blood
to bind the spell

523
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:39,249
that suppressed Niklaus'
werewolf aspect.

524
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,649
But by the time you
brought her to me,

525
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:44,253
she was already dead.

526
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:46,659
You can't rewrite history.

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,860
No. I cannot.

528
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:50,898
And I did not...

529
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:54,103
Not until I had your consent.

00:27:57,473 --> 00:28:00,075
Lenore: When you became
yourself again,

531
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:03,916
you brought her to me
but too late.

532
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:06,287
I told you that you
were a good son,

533

to let me take care of it,

534
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:10,056
that I could help make
it all go away.

"you will not suffer

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,872
"from this memory or be
tormented from the guilt

537
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:26,873
"of your misdeed.

538
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,142
"What goes behind that
door shall stay there

539
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:30,544
and be forgotten."

540
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:35,284
I told you to clean yourself up,

541
00:28:35,286 --> 00:28:37,254
that if you were clean,
no one would know

542
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:39,890
what you are or what you'd done.

543
00:28:46,264 --> 00:28:48,266
And you did exactly that...

544
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,168
And more.

545
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:55,546
You created a place in your
mind to put your victims.

546
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:58,247
You began to believe
that as long as your

547
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:01,052
suit was immaculate
and your hands clean,

548
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:05,958
you could look in the mirror
and tell yourself it's all ok.

549
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,060
No one need know what's
behind that red door.

550
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:14,264
[Screams]

551
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:18,068
But a thousand years
is a long time, Elijah.

552
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:21,704
And a place meant to hold
one unforgivable sin

553
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:25,639
is now full to bursting with
your most monstrous deeds.

554
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,341
Stop!

555
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,742
How long before it's your
beloved Hayley's corpse

556
00:29:28,743 --> 00:29:29,943
behind that door?

557
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:31,077
Stop.

558
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:35,517
You must be afraid that
loving you will destroy her,

559
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:38,987
as it destroyed Celeste, Tatia.

560
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:40,289
Take my offer...

561
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,757
The both of you.

562
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:45,228
In new bodies, you'll
be alive again.

563
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:50,434
You could give her a child
to replace the one she lost.

564
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:54,603
You will not break me.

565
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:58,441
Oh, you are already
broken, my dear boy,

566
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:01,780
but not beyond repair.

567
00:30:01,782 --> 00:30:04,749
I am here to fix you.

568
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:08,989
I am here to fix you all.

569
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:19,258
Bleeding power from
a dark object is tricky,

570
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,060
so it does help to know
what kind of object it is.

571
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:23,528
The white oak stake.

572
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:25,966
You want to drain
the white oak stake, do you?

573
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,302
It's a dark object.

574
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,605
If I can't stop Mikael,
I have to stop

575
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:29,874
that stake from working.

576
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,410
See, usually I like
a girl with ambition,

577
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:32,945
but this is just beyond mad.

578
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:35,414
Just show me the spell,
Kaleb... Kol...

579
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:37,585
Or whatever your name is.

580
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,787
The problem's not
the spell, love.

581
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:40,524
The problem's the
white oak stake.

582
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:41,757
It's too powerful.

583
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,059
We can't just drain it.

584
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,760
The best you can hope
for is to disable it,

585
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,227
but just for a bit.

586
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:47,830
So do you have
a better solution?

587
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:49,864
Because I don't have
time to argue.

588
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:52,200
So show me the spell
and hand me the keys.

589
00:30:52,202 --> 00:30:53,771
Oh, what are you gonna do?

590
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:55,608
You just gonna drive around
till you bump into them?

591
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:57,210
You may have messed
with my bracelet,

592
00:30:57,212 --> 00:30:59,451
but I made sure months ago
that I would always be

593
00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:00,719
able to find Mikael.

594
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,353
All right. Fine.
Your funeral.

595
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:05,056
I'm still not going to allow you

596
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:07,157
to drive me bloody car, though.

597
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:31,378
You're gonna pay for
hurting her.

598
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,651
Oh, that's sweet.

599
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:38,683
The cur whines for its bitch.

600
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:42,123
I'll make sure to drain
the rest of her

601
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:46,228
right in front of your
eyes just before you burn.

602
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:13,260
Davina, wait. We need
to do this together.

603
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:14,561
I'm strong enough on my own.

604
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:16,028
No, you're not.

605
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,499
Listen, I know you
don't trust me...

606
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,068
And that's fair enough...
But these are your mates

607
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:21,335
that we're trying to save here.

608
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:24,871
The only way that we can do
this is if we work together.

609
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:26,775
You need to trust me, all right?

610
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:28,478
Take my hands.

611
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,282
Take my power.
Channel me.

612
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,285
[Mikael grunting]

613
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:42,454
Klaus: I'm not as weak
as you remember, am I?

614
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,767

617
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,580
Aah!

618
00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:01,247
[Klaus screaming]

619
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,623
[Chanting continues]

620
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,911
Why aren't you burning?!

621
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:35,281
If you were dead,
you would burn.

622
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:39,153
Burn!

623
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,622
Kaleb, I can't hold it.

624
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:43,656
Just trust me.

625
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:45,157
[Both continue chanting]

626
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,960
Is this your doing,
little witch?

627
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:51,330
Then you will undo it.

628
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:53,198
Return the power to the stake.

629

Klaus?

632
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:26,200
Mikael: What do you
think you're doing?

633
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:28,065
Stay the hell away from us.

634
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:31,235
Or, I swear to God,
I'll kill you myself.

635
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,635
You have a warrior's heart.

636
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,304
Perhaps I'll keep it
as a souvenir.

637
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:45,877
Now enough!

638
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:49,144
This night has been
a long parade of fools.

639
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:52,015
I'll enjoy killing every
last one of you.

640
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,088
I wouldn't bet on it.

641
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:13,061
It's over, Mikael.
You're outnumbered.

642
00:35:13,062 --> 00:35:16,036
Are you going to beg
for your miserable life?

643
00:35:16,037 --> 00:35:17,503
[Chuckles]

644
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:19,671
You think having people
makes you strong?

645
00:35:19,672 --> 00:35:22,105
It proves how weak you are.

646
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,880
Come find me when you
don't have fools, women,

647
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:29,915
and children fighting
your battles.

648
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,993
Are you ok?

649
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:46,628
Ah, a bit lightheaded.

650
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:48,229
It might have something
to do with being knocked

651
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,430
arse over teacup by
dear old dad.

652
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:52,266
You are lucky to be
alive, young lady.

653
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:53,868
You want to tell me what
the hell you were thinking?

654
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,404
Can we not do this right now?

655
00:35:55,406 --> 00:35:57,308
Am I gonna embarrass you
in front of your friend?

656
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:00,477
Who the hell is this guy anyway?

657
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:02,213
Haven't we got to stop meeting
like this, pal?

658
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:04,382
Davina: He's my friend.
And he's helping me.

659
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:05,750
Help you do what,
wage war on Klaus

660
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:07,319
and help me get killed
in the process?

661
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,886
I just saved Klaus'
life trying to protect you.

662
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,087
Yeah, from a psycho
vampire hunter

663
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,620
that you brought back to life.

664
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:14,188
Kaleb: All right. Enough!

665
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:16,590
Well, I think it's enough.

666
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,193
Well, it should be enough.

667
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:21,797
I mean, we're all friends here,
aren't we?

668
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:27,503
Just stay here till I get back.

669
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,938
I'll handle Klaus.

670
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:37,644
We should get out
of here. Trust me.

671
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,576
My brother's not
the forgiving kind.

672
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:41,410
Even if you did help
out back there,

673
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:43,478
his hatred of betrayal
far outweighs

674
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,148
his sense of gratitude.

675
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:46,885
I'm not afraid of him.

676
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:51,189
You out to get yourself killed?

677
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:53,261
I'm out to get even with Klaus.

678
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:54,597
And you're gonna help me.

679
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:57,270
But, first, you're right.

680
00:36:57,271 --> 00:36:59,373
Let's get out of here.

681
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:13,660
You pulled the stake
out in the Nick of time.

682
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:17,300
A moment longer, and I
would have been done for.

683
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,902
It's the least I could do

684
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,303
for telling you not
to kill that bastard

685
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,201
the first chance you had.

686
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:25,673
Well, he hurt you.

687
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:28,076
For that alone,
I would kill him.

688
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:31,946
You know, in a thousand years,

689
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:34,513
I think it's the first
time I've seen him run.

690
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:35,749
You're still weak.

691
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,618
Hayley: And he knew
he was outmatched.

692
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,887
We checked the perimeter,
and he's definitely gone.

693
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:44,325
I appreciate your assistance.

694
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:46,828
Well, hey. You die, I die.
Just call me selfish.

695
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,699
Yeah. You die, a lot
of people die.

696
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:54,543
But, Klaus, we have
another problem.

697

[Music playing]

698
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,917
No more.

699
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:02,451
I'm afraid we've just begun.

700
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:05,756
You will hang here remembering.

701
00:38:05,757 --> 00:38:08,760
Every atrocity you've
hidden behind that door

702
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:10,966
will emerge to haunt you.

703
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,537
And as you grow weaker,
you will be ripped

704
00:38:13,538 --> 00:38:18,236
of your strength,
your will, your hope.

705
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:23,580
And as you rot here alone, you
will reconsider my offer...

706
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:27,788
A new life, a way to be
freed of your demons,

707
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:30,690
a chance at peace.

708
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:39,567
Hayley: Oh. That's about enough
of that, don't you think?

709
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:41,236
I would have ripped
her heart out,

710
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:43,304
but she would have just
body-jumped me.

711

How do I get these off?

00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:51,620
The doll. There.
Break it.

713
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,155
She's using it to bind me.

714
00:39:01,197 --> 00:39:03,234
You need to feed.

715
00:39:03,235 --> 00:39:04,436
I can't.

716
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:05,907
You're weak.

717
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:07,342
I can't.

718
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:10,980
I crave you.

719
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:15,218
My hunger, it could
overwhelm me.

720
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,358
Look...

721
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:23,765
I'm not afraid.

722
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,071
What did you do to him?

723
00:39:55,472 --> 00:39:57,105
I let him dream.

724
00:39:58,641 --> 00:40:02,614
That's considerate of you.

725
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,521
I cannot lead him
out of darkness

726
00:40:05,522 --> 00:40:09,359
by simply exposing him
to the horrors of his past.

727
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,798
I have to let him bask
in his own version

728
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:14,902
of a better world to come.

729
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:25,476
And by the time he wakes,

730
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:33,804
he will know the only way
to find peace, is my way.

731
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:48,091
