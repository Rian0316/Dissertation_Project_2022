00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,050
你沒提到我的花園
You didn't mention my garden.

160
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,970
花園是你后院的一部分
Well, your garden is part of your backyard,

161
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,750
所以它自動算在給珍的財產里
so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn.

162
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,690
它和房子是一起的  媽媽
It comes with the house, Mom.

163
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,550
我覺得你得特別提一下
Well, I think you need to mention it by name

164
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,060
萬一某些壞法官耍陰招就不好辦了
in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks.

165
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,340

I'm sorry. I got my wires crossed a little.

185

我欠你太多
I owe you big-time.

190

危機解除了...
Crisis averted...

192
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,680
我想是的
I guess.

193
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,220
他又變回了以前的查克  所以...
I mean, he's back to being the same old Chuck, so...

194
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,660
想說說嗎
Wanna talk about it?

195
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,170
看情況
Depends.

196
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,610
有可能會涉及那件
It may or may not involve

197
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,320
你說你決不想討論的事
that thing you said you never, ever wanted to discuss.

198
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,290
那好吧  謝謝
Okay, then, thanks.

199
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,180
我得回去干活了
I gotta get back to it.

200
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,560
不如我們今天休息吧
How 'bout we call it a day?

201
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,630
我請你吃晚飯
I'll buy you some dinner.

202
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,440
你開玩笑吧
You're kidding, right?

203
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,430
你知道我的工作落后了多少嗎
You realize how far behind I am?

204
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,060
更別提我現在還有八個遺囑需要處理
Not to mention now I've got eight entire wills to finish up.

205
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,570
你說什么  遺囑的工作我來做
Whaddya talking about? I'll do the wills.

206

-不用你做  -我當然要做
- No, you won't. ‭- 'Course I will.

207
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,160
做遺囑  他們是我的委托人
Do the wills. They're my clients.

208
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,450
他們是我的委托人
They're my clients.

209
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,990
我們不是合伙人  記得嗎
You and I aren't partners, remember?

210
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,130
一旦我接手了這些人
Once I take these people on,

211
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,200
-就不能再把他們還給你  -得了吧
- I can't just reassign them to you. - ‭Aw, c'mon.

212
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,540
你這么較真干什么
Why you getting all, like, legal on me, huh?

213
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,620
誰會在意
Who cares?

214
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,040
我跟每個委托人都說了
Look, I told every single one of them the situation --

215
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,840
只有我在  你今天不在
that they'd be getting me instead of you.

216
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,860
我勸他們改天再來找你
I tried to talk them all into coming back another day.

217
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,350
六個人離開了  也許你可以把這些人追回來
Six of 'em left. ‭Maybe you'll get those back.

218
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,880
如果這是錢的問題  我...
I mean, look, if this is about the money, I have --

219
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,520
不是錢的問題  錢你留著好了
It's not about the money. You can keep the money.

220
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,860
別以為我想這樣
Don't act like I wanted this.

221
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,880
天哪  好像我在吃鍋望盆似的
Jesus, like I need more on my plate.

222
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,330
你生氣了嗎
Are you mad?

我沒生氣
I'm not mad.

我只是...
I'm just, uh...

在想些事情
...thinking about things.

226
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,960
今天有那么一會兒  查克沒有討厭我
For 10 minutes today, Chuck didn't hate me.

227
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,240
我都忘了那是什么感覺了
I forgot what that felt like.

228
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,270
吉米
Jimmy.

229
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,780
你剛剛承認犯了一項重罪你知道吧
You do realize ‭you just confessed to a felony?

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,180
算是吧
I guess.

231
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,520
可你覺得好多了  是吧
But you feel better, right?

232
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,370
再說了  就我們倆  空口無憑
Besides, ‭it's your word against mine.

233
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,680
到這里就結束了
That's the end of it.

Howard?

235
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,470

That's the end. ‭

236
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,120
你能...
Could you...?

237
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,740
好的
Oh, yeah.

238
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,510
你現在相信我了嗎
Well, now do you believe me?

239
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,930
我都不知道該從何說起
I don't even know where to begin.

240
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,960
但是  是的  我相信你
But yes, I believe you.

241
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,380
你弟弟是一個超級大混蛋
Your brother is one ‭world-class son of a bitch.

242
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,510
別見怪
No offense.

243
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,590
不過我真希望你在錄音之前
I just -- I really wish you'd told me

244
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,870
能先把計劃告訴我
about these plans of yours before you went out and did it.

245
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,380
我知道  霍華德  我很后悔誤導了你
I know, Howard, ‭and I regret misleading you.

246
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,750
只是我必須得掌握一些真憑實據
It's just that a certain... vérité had to be established.

247
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,480
我不是說你差點把我嚇出心臟病的事
I'm not talking about the heart attack that you nearly gave me.

248
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,230
查克  這卷錄音帶...
Chuck, this tape --

249
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,560
我不確定這帶子有什么用
I'm not sure ‭exactly what it accomplishes.

250
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,760
你比我更懂證據法規
Look, you know evidentiary rules better than I do,

251
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,480
一盤秘密錄制的帶子
but a secretly recorded tape

252
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,310
和有疑問的證據鏈
with a problematic chain of evidence?

253
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,550
你很難讓這些證據上庭
You're gonna have a helluva time getting that admitted.

254
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,710
沒錯
I agree.

255
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,430
就算你想辦法把證據呈給陪審團
And if you somehow put it in front of a jury,

256
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,110
吉米會叫一批音頻專家
Jimmy'd call a dozen audio experts,

257
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,220
說那不是他的聲音
say that voice isn't his,

258
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,830
說那盤帶子被處理過
say the -- the tape had been edited.

259
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,950
他確實會
He would, indeed.

260
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,740
你是為了梅薩維德的凱文·沃弛泰爾才演這出嗎
Are you thinking about playing this for Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde?

261
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,220
雖然我很想留住他們
Because as much as I would love to,

262
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,860
但生意已經黃了
that ship has sailed.

263
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,560
我們無論如何也找不回他們了
We're never getting them back, regardless.

264
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,980
我覺得我們連那里的門都進不去
Oh, I doubt we could even get in the door over there.

265
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,380
查克  如果那盤帶子在法庭上沒用
Chuck, if that tape is useless in a court of law

266
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,360
也沒有公眾輿論的支持
and no help ‭in the court of public opinion,

267
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,460
還有什么意義
what's the point?

268
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,990
我想不到有什么用途
Because I can't think of a single use for it.

269
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,510

00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,750
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}出自上世紀20年代歌曲

309
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,340
那我可有得期待的了
Now I've got something to look forward to.

310
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,920
-行  拜拜  -拜
- Okay, bye-bye. - ‭Bye.

311
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,870
再見
See ya!

312
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,620
謝謝你們耐心的等待
Thank you for waiting so patiently.

313
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,410
下一個是誰
Who do we have next?

314
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,430
應該是我
That'd be me.

315
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,810
你好  你好
Hello, hello.

316
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,970
很高興再見到你
It's so good to see you again.

317
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,070
我護送你和你的委托人進入我的基地
I escorted you and your clients onto my base.

318
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,380
我熱情尊敬地對待你
I treated you ‭with hospitality and respect,

319
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,330
結果卻發現你嘴里吐出來的全是謊言
and now I come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie.

320
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,950
上尉  拜托  不如先坐下
Captain, please. Why don't -- sit down.

321
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,110
放輕松
Take a load off.

322
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,920
你需要免費的咖啡還是軟飲料
I'll get you a complimentary coffee or a soft drink?

323
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,900
還有你所謂的戰爭英雄  "軟糖"·塔爾博特
And your so-called war hero, "Fudge" Talbott?

324
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,680
沒這個人  根本沒有
No such person -- never was.

325
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,670
確實  里面進行了藝術性的虛構
Granted, some artistic license may have been taken.

326
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,590
你以欺詐的方式進入政府部門  先生
You entered government property under false pretenses, sir.

327
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,290
我不了解你們的流程
I am no expert on your procedures

328
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,760
還有那些章程什么的
and your protocols and whatnot,

329
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,700
所以如果我們遺漏了什么手續
so if -- if we failed to cross a "T" Or dot an "I,"

330
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,040
造成了誤會  我真誠地向你道歉
I sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding.

331
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,300
不不  這才不是誤會
N-No, no, no, it's not a misunderstanding!

332
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,220
別靠近啦  看看大局
Just step back! ‭B-Big picture this, okay?!

333
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,450
沒造成什么損壞吧
It -- ‭What damage was done?!

334
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,310
也沒人受傷吧
Hey, who was hurt, huh?

335
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,220
有什么影響嗎
What was damaged?

336
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,500
基地還在那里  對吧
The -- The base is still there, right?

337
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,370
那架B-52轟炸機應該還...
The B-52 is, I presume, still --

338
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,420
是B-29
B-29.

339
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,580
B-29轟炸機  菲菲是架B-29
B-29. FIFI's a B-29.

340
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,700
我不...
I don't...

341
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,230
你覺得這一切都只是個笑話吧
This is all just one big joke to you, huh?

342
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,970
你不喜歡那個廣告
You don't like the commercial.

343
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,000
我的確不喜歡
No, no, I don't,

344
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,680
但這件事跟廣告根本沒關...
but this has nothing to do with the comm--

345
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,170
我們隨時歡迎建設性的批評
Well, constructive criticism is always welcome.

346
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,610
-可我沒...  -但是你要知道
- But I didn't -- - But you should realize

347
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,450
大部分觀眾都覺得廣告振奮人心  甚至很愛國
that most people find it uplifting -- patriotic, even.

348
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,510
-不  -你去查查新兵招募人數
- No. ‭- You check ‭your recruiting numbers.

349
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,130
-我...  -你應該會發現有所增長  還有
- I-I-I -- - ‭I think you're gonna see an uptick, and you know what?

350
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,230
如果大家得知軟糖并沒有打過仗...
If it turns out that Fudge wasn't actually in the war --

351
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,800
根本沒有軟糖這個人  他當然沒打過仗
Fudge is not a person. He wasn't in the war.

352
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,530
湯姆·克魯斯也沒有
Well, neither was Tom Cruise,

353
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,380
但你瞧瞧《壯志凌云》對你的影響
and look what "Top Gun" did for you.

354
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,050
你欺騙了我  當著我的面說謊
You lied to me, you lied to my face,

355
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,620
我不能就這么放過你
and I can't let you get away with it.

356
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,560
那我們只能...
I-I think we just --

357
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,370
我們只能求同存異了
we're just gonna have to agree to disagree,

358
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,880
我給你倒杯咖啡帶走吧
so, uh, can I get you that coffee to go or...?

359
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,400
不  我來告訴你該怎么辦
No, no. I-I'm gonna tell you what's happening now.

360
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,430
你必須撤掉那個電視廣告
You're gonna take that ad off the air.

361
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,840
如果你在電視上再播放一次
And if you play that ad one more time,

362
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,300
我就告訴軍法檢察官
I'm gonna go to the Judge Advocate,

363
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,700
我們會逮捕你
and we will take you down --

364
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,570
非法闖入  虛假陳述
trespassing, false representation,

365
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,200
冒充戰爭英雄  所有這些罪名
stolen valor -- the whole nine yards.

366
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,610
不是吧  就因為廣告里那八秒鐘嗎
Seriously, for eight seconds of a TV commercial?

367
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,540
你撤掉那個廣告  否則就要付出慘痛的代價
You take that ad down, or there'll be hell to pay.

368
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,820
我說得夠清楚了嗎
That clear enough for you?

369
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,540
有本事就試試
Make me.

370
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,820
-真的嗎  -真的
- Yeah? ‭ - Yeah.

371
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,140
-試試  -我跟你斗到底
- Make you? - ‭Yeah, let's do this.

372
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,560
你把指揮官帶到這兒來
You bring ‭your commander down here,

373
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,500
我會向他解釋  是你帶我們進基地
and I'll explain to him how you let us on the base,

374
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,650
還給予我們明星般待遇
red-carpet treatment.

375
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,520
不  因為你騙了我
No, b-because you lied your way in.

376
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,120
我記憶中可不是這樣
Not how I remember it.

377
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,200
-事實就是...  -我有目擊證人給我作證
- What happened -- - And I've got witnesses to back me up.

378
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,370
你喜歡當空軍上尉嗎
Do you like being ‭an Air Force Captain, huh?

379
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,360
你覺得美國政府
You think the United States

380
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
會控告一個坐輪椅的老人嗎
wants to bring action against an old man in a wheelchair?!

381
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,070
在電視上他是站著的  他都沒坐在輪椅上
He was standing on TV. He wasn't even in a wheelchair!

382
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,910
沒錯  他那時的確是站著
Well, yeah. Well, periodically, he is.

383
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,840
但他出庭時
And when he shows up in court,

384
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,720
絕對會坐在輪椅上
you better believe he'll be in a wheelchair!

385
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,680
是啊  因為你就是發災難財的人渣
Right, because you're an ambulance-chasing piece of shit,

386
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,400
你們都一樣
'cause you're all the same --

387
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,050
-你跟其他律師都一樣  -總是這么道貌岸然
- you're the same as all the others. - Always on a high horse.

388
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,370
總是想讓我自己覺得...
Always trying to make me feel like I'm --

389
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,670
我是個律師
Look, um, I'm a lawyer,

390
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,760
這就是我每天的工作
and this is what I do all day, every day,

391
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,540
要不這樣吧
so h-how about this?

392
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,750
我不播有飛機的畫面
I-I won't fly jet planes --

393
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,990
你也不要告我們
you, uh, stay out of court.

394
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,340
你覺得怎么樣
Does that sound good?

395
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,830
你們這種人
You know, guys like you --

396
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,270
覺得自己很聰明
you think you're so damn smart,

397
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,640
不用跟其他人講道德
and you think you don't have to play straight with anybody.

398
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,660
風水輪流轉
The wheel is gonna turn.

399
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,480
你沒好果子吃的
It always does.

400
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,300
"你可以信賴的律師"
"A lawyer you can trust."

401
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,580
放狗屁
My ass!

402
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
感謝你為國服役
Thank you for your service!

403
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,320
半夜三點半  不是吧
3:30 in the morning? Seriously?

404
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,450
你能幫我弄到那個嗎
You get me that?

405
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,330
我不知道
I don't know.

406
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,800
-真的有這東西嗎  -是的
- It's a real thing? - ‭Yeah.

407
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,950
那可以  我認識一個人有門路
Then, yeah. ‭I know someone who can get it.

408
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,960
多少錢
How much?

409
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,210
我看起來像電商的人嗎
What do I look like -- RadioShack?

410
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,160
我付多少你給多少
It's gonna cost you whatever it costs me,

411
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,270
加上我的酬勞
plus my end.

412
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,190
先談談酬勞吧
Well, let's start with that.

413
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,580
一般是五百美元左右
Normally, be about $500,

414
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,240
但鑒于這是下班時間的上門服務
but seeing that this is an after-hours house call,

415
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,210
就一千吧
let's make it a grand.

416
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,880
小狗怎么樣
How's the pup?

417
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,720
還好嗎
Doing okay?

418
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,280
挺好的
Yeah.

419
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,530
它沒有被一個人留在家里一整天吧
She's not being left alone all day, is she?

420
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,640
-有人陪它  -那就好
- She's got plenty of company. ‭- Good.

421
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,650
這要花上我幾天時間
This is gonna take me a few days,

422
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,970
東西到手我會通知你
so I'll let you know.

423
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,010
下一次
And next time,

424
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,930
我們盡量在工作時間談工作
let's try to make business happen during business hours.

425
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,890
這一定對我周四要做的PPT有幫助
Well, this will certainly help my Thursday PowerPoint.

426
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,160
很好
Excellent.

427
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,840
這是凱文給亞利桑那州監管員的信的草稿
That's a draft letter from Kevin to the Arizona regulator.

428
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,470
我知道他喜歡溫情的筆觸
I know he likes the personal touch.

429
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,120
他一定會喜歡的
He's gonna love it.

430
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,450
我不敢相信你在三天內做了這么多
I can't believe you did all of this in three days.

431
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,700
我是不是看錯了
Am I reading this right --

432
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,680
你把重審提前了
did you get the rehearing moved up?

433
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,610
是的  那是三個可能的日期
Yeah. Those are three possible dates,

434
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,480
看你和凱文有沒有時間
pending your and Kevin's schedule.

435
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,760
我能安排最早的日期是四號
The soonest I could get is the 4th.

436
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,830
你把它提前了近三周
You moved it up almost three weeks.

437
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,430
我會再試試  看看能不能做得更好
I'll give it another shot and see if I can do better.

438
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,760
你是在開玩笑嗎
Are you kidding me? ‭

439
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,340
凱文會開心死了
Kevin'll be popping champagne!

440
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,670
我就知道你是最適合的人選
I knew ‭you were the right one for this.

441
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:57,090
{\an8}梅薩維德銀行

442
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,310
我很感激你給我這次機會
Well, I appreciate the opportunity.

443
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,740
你應該聽聽那個傲慢的混蛋
Yeah, you should have heard how that arrogant jerk

444
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,990
在聽證會上是怎么跟我說的
spoke to me at the hearing.

445
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,880
就當著凱文的面
Right there, in front of Kevin,

446
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,760
他說我在添亂
he accuses me of muddying the waters --

447
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,170
添亂
muddying...the...waters.

448
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,770
他可是連地址都搞錯
I mean, he's the one who can't even get the address right.

449
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,810
是啊  那是...
Yeah, that's --

450
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,240
我知道你在哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所有朋友
I know you have friends over at HHM,

451
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,700
他們肯定說得天花亂墜  可拜托
and they sure talk a good game, but come on.

452
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,510
像他們那樣的人  如果到了關鍵時刻
