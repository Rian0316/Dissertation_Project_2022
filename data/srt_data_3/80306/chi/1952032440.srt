00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,020
是, 大臣  第1季第6集

4
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:40,000
知情权利

5
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:09,300
伯纳 大臣还没来吗?
Bernard. Minister not in yet?

6
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,350
来了 他在办公室里开会
He's in his office,having a meeting.

7
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,821
什么会?
What about?

9
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,472
没什么重要的
Nothing very important.

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,954
这样啊
I see.

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,918
昨天开的是什么会?
And whatwas that meetingin there yesterday?

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,759
大臣在审查资料报告程序
He was just reviewingprocedures for briefing him

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,229
关于议会质询的
on answersto Parliamentary questions.

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,271
但是部门负责人 秘书和下属都出席了
But there were Principals presentand other assorted underlings.

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,599
只是为他组织材料的人 汉弗莱爵士
Just the ones who supply himwith the information, actually.

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,479
伯纳 这种事得马上停止
Bernard, this has to be stoppedat once.

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
为什么?
Why?

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,395
如果他和下属交谈上了 他不就比我们超前了
Lfhe talks to the underlings,he may learn things we don't know.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,713
完全动摇我们的地位      如果我们能增长知识...
Ourposition could be undermined.If it increases ourknowledge...

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,190
增长知识不值得以权威为代价
It is folly if it's at the expenseof your authority.

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
为什么?
Why?

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,276
伯纳 请别问为什么了
Bernard, please stop saying why.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
为什么?
Why?

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,800
我是说 您能否展开论述一下?
I mean, could you developthat point please?

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,751
你觉得大臣开始掌管部门了吗?
Would you say that the Ministeris starting to run the Department?

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,833
对 管得还不错
Yes, things are going pretty well,actually.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,356
不 伯纳 当一位大臣亲自掌管部门
No, when a Ministeractuallystarts to run his Department

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,476
事情不会"不错"
things are not going pretty well.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,517
只会大错特错
They are actuallygoing prettybadly.

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,558
可如今...我说 实际上
But actually... er... I mean, in fact,

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,314
管理部门不是大臣的职责么?
isn't it the Minister's jobto run the Department?

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,118
不 伯纳 这是我们的职责
No, Bernard, it is ourjob.

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,237
准确的说 是我的职责
Orto be more precise,it is my job,

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,358
为此我有25年的经验和训练
forwhich I've had 25 yearsexperience and training.

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,035
你不知道让大臣来管后果会怎样?
Don't you realise whatwouldhappen if the Ministerruns it?

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
不知道 怎样?
No, what?

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,590
首先 当然会乱成一团
First, there would be chaos,naturally.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,320
第二 更有甚者
And second,which is much more serious,

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,311
将会爆发革新
there would be innovations.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,754
改革 伯纳
Changes, Bernard.

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,797
公开辩论 流言满天飞
Public debate.Outside scrutiny.

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,473
难道你愿意?
Is that what you want?

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,112
天啊 当然不要 那他该干什么?
Good heavens, no.But what should he do then?

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,790
伯纳 大臣有三项职能
A Ministerhas three functions.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,598
首先 搞推销
First, as an advocate,

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,800
让议会和公众接受部里的行动
making the Department's actionsseem plausible

47
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:00,797
他是我们的公关员
to Parliament and public,he is ourpublic relations man.

48
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,474
其次 他是我们的议会代表
Second, he is ourmanin Westminster,

49
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,677
让我们的立法得以通过
steering our legislationthrough Parliament.

50
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,274
第三 他得养活我们
And third, he is ourbreadwinner.

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,513
在内阁争取经费 好让我们
He has to fight in Cabinetforthe money we need

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,318
运转我们的部门
to run our Department.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,958
但他不该审查部里的工作程序
But, he is not here to reviewdepartmental procedures

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,190
与秘书及下属交流
with Principalsand Assistant Secretaries.

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,828
也许他刚好有空      他怎么会有空?
But ifhe's go the time.Why has he got the time?

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,673
他不该有空 这是你的错 伯纳
He shouldn't.That's yourfault, Bernard!

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,309
你得保证他没有空
You must ensurehe hasn't got the time.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,678
给他找事 伯纳
Create activity, Bernard!

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,348
他得去演讲 访问
He should be makingspeeches, visits.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,556
派出代表团 出国考察
We need deputations,junkets abroad,

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,599
大批文件盒 得有危机 灾难 险情
mountains of red boxes, we needcrises, emergencies, panics!

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,514
振作起来 伯纳      好的 可是...
Pull yourself together, Bernard.Yes, but...

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,353
你让他日程表里有空?      不 他安排的
You leave spaces in his diary?No, he makes those.

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,272
全部填满      他不允许
Fill them up.He won't let me.

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,112
别理他 填满
Don't ask him. Do it.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,349
尽量让他把时间花在无害的地方
Make sure he spends more timewhere he can't do any damage.

67
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,149
哪里呢?      好比说下院
But where?The House of Commons, for instance.

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,112
汉弗莱爵士 我真的尽力了 有个代表团在里面
I really do try my best.There's a deputation in there.

69
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,430
什么代表团 伯纳?
What is it about, Bernard?

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,991
无关紧要 保护沃里克郡的獾
Somethingcompletely trivial,preserving badgers inWarwickshire.

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,191
干得好 伯纳
Well done, Bernard.

72
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,471
怎么不早告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me thiswhen I asked you before?

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,593
说实话 我觉得这事太琐碎
Actually, I thoughtitwas rathertrivial.

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,672
浪费大臣的时间 我以为您不赞成
I didn't thinkyou would approve, actually.

75
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,592
伯纳
Bernard.

76
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,514
要不要我再去找些濒危动物?
I'll try and find some morethreatened species then, shall I?

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,989
远在天边 近在眼前
You may not have to look veryfar.

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,034
身为秘书管不住大臣 
Secretaries who can't occupy theirMinisters 

79
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:35,034
这就是濒危动物
are a threatened species,

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,114
现成的
actually.

81
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,279
您不明白吗 保护自然遗产是我们的神圣使命
We have a sacred trustto preserve ournatural heritage.

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,716
可我这项新法的目的就在这里
That's what this new legislationis designed to ensure.

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,270
我在下院也说 现有体制行不通
As I said in the House,the system simply isn'tworking.

84
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,953
乱炖一锅
It's a hotchpotch.

85
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,390
地方政府 旅游局
Local authorities,tourist authorities,

86
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,836
国家公园 自治委员会 乡村保护协会
national parks,countryside commision, C.P.R.E.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,309
定位不明 形同虚设
Nobody knows where they are,nothing gets done.

88
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,550
只会互相扯皮 推卸责任
They're all back bitingand buck passing.

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,392
那些委员会就是这个样
You knowwhat committees are like.

90
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,993
我们也是委员会啊
We are a committee.

91
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,239
对 我不是说你们这种
Yes. I didn't meanyoursort of committee.

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,393
但这项新法旨在统一权责 简化程序
But this new legislation isdesigned to create clearauthority,

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,028
节约大笔公共资金
and save a great dealof public money.

94
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,988
你们应该欢迎      那敢情好 可海华树林怎么办?
You ought to welcome it.But what about Hayward's Spinney?

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,073
少数小地方会失去保护区地位
Afew very small areas will losetheirspecially protected status,

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,754
由于继续保护它们
because it isn't economicalany longer,

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,990
不再有经济效益
to maintain themas they ought to.

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,958
海华树林是自然遗产的重要组成部分
Hayward's Spinney isa vital part of ourheritage.

99
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,509
獾们祖祖辈辈居住在那里
The badgers have dwelt thereforgenerations.

100
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,036
你确定吗?      《卫报》说的
Can you be sure of that?It said so in The Guardian.

101
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,349
啊 这个...
Ah, well...

102
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,029
确实说獾们祖祖辈辈居住在那里
Actually it says that the badgershave dwelt there forgenerations!

103
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,112
设身处地想
Howwould you feel if you had

104
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,714
你家后院里冒出一片办公楼
a lot of office blocksbuilt overyourgarden

105
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,472
由天外来獾建造 那又怎样?
by a lot of giant badgers?

106
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,200
可一片办公楼...天外来獾?
But a lot of office blocks...giant badgers?

107
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,874
人类没有特权 哈克先生
There's nothing specialabout man, Mr. Hacker.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,952
我们不凌驾于自然之上 我们属于自然
We're not above nature.We're all a part of it.

109
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,997
您知道 人也是兽类
Men are animals too, you know.

110
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,072
我知道 我刚去过下院
Yes, I've just come fromthe House of Commons.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,076
抱歉 大臣 您下个约会快开始了
Sorry, Minister, you are dueforyournext appoinment.

112
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,514
哦 真是遗憾
Oh, what a pity.

113
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,717
谢谢你们这么有力的发言
Thank you forputtingyourcase so persuasively.

114
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,313
幸会幸会
It's been a pleasure.

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,755
请从左边走廊下楼梯
Left at the corridorand down the stairs.

116
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,790
但您究竟打算怎么办?
But whatwill you do about it?

117
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,077
届时我们会参考一切观点
All views will be takeninto consideration.

118
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,430
我先失陪了...
Now if you'll excuse me...

119
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,829
您表现太好了 大臣 富有亲和力
Very polished performance.Gracious.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,718
虚晃一枪 多专业啊
And said nothing.Very professional.

121
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,189
怎么没人警告我?      警告什么 大臣?
Why wasn't I warned?About what?

122
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,237
警告我 统一这些管理部门
That unifying the administration

123
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,710
会取消这个海狸什么的保护区?
would remove protected statusfrom this beaverwhatsit?

124
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,111
獾群 大臣 在海华树林 东沃里克郡
Badgercolony. Hayward'sSpinney, East Warwickshire.

125
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,077
一定有人知道
Somebodymust have know about it.

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,992
大臣 即使真的有人知道
If somebody did happen to know,

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,516
他们未必知道您想知道
they wouldn't necessarily knowthat you wanted to know

128
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,319
他们刚好知道的东西 为此...
what they happened to know,in case...

129
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,279
啊 汉弗莱爵士      汉弗莱
Ah! Sir Humphrey!Humphrey!

130
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,919
早安 大臣
Good morning, Minister.

131
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,390
汉弗莱 难道你的工作是帮大臣丢人现眼?
Is it yourjob to help Ministersmake fools of themselves?

132
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,676
大臣们还真不用我帮忙
I have nevermet onethat needed any help.

133
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,198
不 绝对不是...
No, it is the last thing...

134
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,399
为什么你让我告诉议会和媒体 这个统一法案
Why did you encourage me to saythat unifying the administration

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,996
毫无隐患 结果我在给一支
meant no loss of amenity,when I've signed a death warrant

136
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,798
海狸陆战队判死刑?
fora whole army ofbeavers?

137
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,518
是獾 大臣      怎么?
Badgers, Minister.What?

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,352
海狸只有海军
Beavers would have a navy.

139
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,151
你怎能让我这样说?      恕我直言 我可没让您说
Why did you let me do it?I did not encourage you to say that.

140
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,470
明明有 部里准备了这个
You did!The Department prepared this.

141
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,194
写着"毫无隐患"      不 大臣
"No loss of amenity", it says.No.

142
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,432
是"毫无重大隐患"      一回事
"No significant loss of amenity".Same thing.

143
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,670
正相反 这区别可大了
There's all the differencein the world.

144
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,832
可以指责任何事"有隐患"
Almost anything can be attackedas a "loss of amenity",

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,436
到头来总可以辩解说"毫无重大隐患"
and be defended as"not a significant loss of amenity".

146
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,831
尤其凸显出"重大"一词意义重大
One should appreciatethe significance of"significant".

147
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,758
如果是这样
Well, be that as it may,

148
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,036
任何宣传都危险了
any publicity would bevery damaging.

149
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,633
哦 我看不会 大臣
Oh, I think not.

150
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,360
明明说没隐患 结果造成了隐患
But if there is a loss of amenity...

151
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,909
请过目这份新闻稿 大臣 您会看到
If you'd approve this release,you would see

152
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,389
它能平息所有争论
that it does counterall theirarguments.

153
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,314
里面指出保护区只是取消 没有受威胁
It points out that the spinneyis deregistered, not threatened.

154
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,597
沃里克郡遍地都是獾
Badgers are very plentifulall overWarwickshire.

155
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,716
它同时指出了
And it points out the connection

156
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,189
獾与普鲁士菌病的联系
between Badgersand brucellosis.

157
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,149
以及"不会造成重大隐患" 都在里面
"Cannot be regardedas a significant loss of amenity".

158
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,115
各大媒体不会批评喽?
So this might not getinto the National Press?

159
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,989
《卫报》内页会说几句 不用担心
Afew lines on The Guardian.Nothing to worry about.

160
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,989
实际上 只有城市中产阶级操心
Only the urban middle classworry about

161
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,597
保护乡村的事 他们不用住那里
the preservation of the countryside,because they don't live in it.

162
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,715
还有事吗 大臣?      没了
Would that be all, Minister?Yes!

163
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,872
有 这事算你有理
No, this may well blow over,

164
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,474
但我的基本问题还在
but it doesn't answermy basic question.

165
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,837
什么问题?      为什么我宣布前没听说?
Which was?Why wasn't I told about it?

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,312
有人曾经非常中肯地说过
There are those who have arguedand indeed cogently

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,153
有必要时 某些事情
that on occasionthere are some things

168
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,754
大臣还是不知道的好
it is betterfora Ministernot to know.

169
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,478
你说什么?
What are you talking about?

170
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,949
大臣 您在议会
Minister, youranswersin the House

171
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,350
和记者招待会上的发言非常得体
and at the Press Conferencewere superb.

172
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,193
掷地有声 令人心悦诚服
You were convincing.The critics were silenced.

173
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,158
但您是否还能这么坚定
But could you have spokenwith the same authority

174
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,074
如果有生态保护组织 在诱您出洞?
if the ecological pressure grouphad been badgering you?

175
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,196
但我有知情权 我是人民的代表
But I have a right to know!I am the people's representative!

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,432
你有什么权利把信息藏起来?
What right have you gotto withhold this information?

177
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,229
这是为您着想 大臣      什么叫"还是不知道的好"?
It's in yourown best interests.What do you mean?

178
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,119
无法无天 不能这样下去
It's outrageous!It must not occuragain.

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,238
我拟了计划 改组这个部门
I've a plan forthe reorganisingof this Department

180
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,356
保证这种事下不为例
which would ensurethat it doesn't.

181
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,272
真的?      千真万确
Indeed?Yes, indeed.

182
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,998
如果一名副秘书长
If I had one UnderSecretary

183
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,913
和两名助理秘书直接向我报告...
and two Assistant Secretariesreporting to me...

184
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,913
拜托 大臣      听我把计划说完
Minister. Please!Let me tell you my plan.

185
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,638
计划无关紧要
The plan is immaterial.

186
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,678
大臣 我有些话告诉您
Minister, I havesomething to say to you

187
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,637
可能您不爱听
which you may notlike to hear.

188
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,514
哪天你没说过?
Why should today beany different?

189
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,119
大臣 传统的权责分配方式
Minister, the traditional allocationof executive responsabilities

190
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,999
一贯旨在厘清
has always been so determinedas to liberate

191
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,835
大臣职责与行政琐事之分野
the ministerial incumbentfrom the administrative minutiae

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,037
通过将管理职能下放
by devolvingthe managerial functions

193
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,670
给那些更有资历
to those whose qualificationshave betterformed them

194
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,799
处理这些琐事的人 从而
forthe performance of suchhumble offices, thereby releasing

195
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,270
让政治领导人投入其地位
theirpolitical overlordsforthe more onerous duties

196
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,557
与职责要求的繁重工作
and deliberations which arethe inevitable concomitant

197
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,870
与深刻思考之中
of theirexalted position.

198
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,073
为什么你觉得我不爱听呢?
What made you thinkI wouldn'twant to hearthat?

199
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,472
我以为会冒犯您
I thought it might upset you.

200
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,672
冒犯什么? 我一个字都没懂
How could it?I didn't understand a single word.

201
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,952
汉弗莱 你就不能说简单点?
Foronce in your life,put it into plain English.

202
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,394
这是您要求的
If you insist.

203
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,592
您不该管部里的工作
You are not hereto run this Department.

204
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,399
你再说一遍?
I beg yourpardon?

205
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,994
您不该管部里的工作
You are not hereto run this Department.

206
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,469
我认为该管 人民也同意
I think I am.The people think I am, too.

207
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,155
恕我直言 大臣 您...他们错了
With respect Minister,you are... they are wrong.

208
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,311
那由谁来管?
And who does runthis Department?

209
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,635
我管
I do.

210
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,800
原来如此
Oh, I see...

211
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,553
那我干什么?      我们谈过这些的
What am I supposed to do?We've been through all this.

212
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,199
制定政策
Make policy.

213
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,998
推动法律生效
Get legislation enacted.

214
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,436
尤其要让内阁保障我们的财政预算
And above all securethe Department's budget in Cabinet.

215
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,909
你就关心财政预算
It seems the budgetis all you care about.

216
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,752
大臣 此事至关重要
It is rather important.

217
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,039
不关心预算 我们部会缩小到
We might end upwith a department so small

218
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,395
连大臣都能管过来了
that even a Ministercould run it.

219
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,557
汉弗莱 我们对民主的本质理解不同吗?
Are we to have a disagreementabout the nature of democracy?

220
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,712
不 大臣 只是分工问题
No, Minister, merelya demarcation dispute.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,878
我是说部里
What I meanis that the menial chore

222
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,600
这些家务事不劳您费心
of running a departmentis beneath you.

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,275
您有更崇高的使命
You're fashionedfora noblercalling.

224
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,432
好吧 日常文书工作我交给你
Well, I leavethe routine paperwork to you

225
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,558
但我必须直接获得所有信息
but I must insist on direct accessto all information.

226
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,756
再不许说"有些事情"
Neveragain"There are some things

227
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,514
"大臣还是不知道的好" 明白吗?
it is betterfora Ministernot to know".

228
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,513
不过 大臣      这是命令 汉弗莱
Well, Minister...That is an order, Humphrey!

229
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,633
遵命 大臣 这是您要求的
As you say, Minister.If that is what you really want.

230
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,475
居然把内阁大臣当10岁小毛孩
It's treating Cabinet Ministersas if they were ten yearolds.

231
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
午安
Afternoon.

232
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,552
《卫报》看完了 爸?      看完了
Finished with The Guardian?Yes.

233
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,275
抱歉没帮你买《社会主义工人报》
I haven't gotthe Socialist Workerforyou.

234
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,913
你爸看到你下来吃早餐很高兴 对吧?
Daddy's pleased to see you downforbreakfast?

235
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,992
他好久没见你了      我不过睡个懒觉
He hasn't seen you fora while...I was having a lie-in.

236
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,476
总比静坐示威好
Betterthan a sit-in, I suppose.

237
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,471
你昨天怎么回家那么晚?
Why were you so latelast night?

238
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,076
某些事当爸的还是不知道的好
There are some things it's betterfora fathernot to know.

239
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,833
你少来这套
Don't you start!

240
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,429
什么?      没事  没事
What?Nothing, nothing.

241
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,431
我跟"托派"们在一起
I was outwith the Trots.

242
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,313
天
Gosh...

243
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,551
没着凉吧?
Are you going to see a doctor?

244
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,113
托洛茨基分子
The Trotskyites!

245
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,636
哦 你现在信托洛茨基啦?
Oh, a Trotskyite now are you?

246
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,949
不 是彼得
No. Peter is.

247
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,189
彼得?
Peter?

248
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,674
对 彼得
Yes, Peter.

249
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,910
你只见过他15次左右
You've only met himabout 15 times.

250

哦 就是那个这样...这样...的?

251
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
对

吉姆 今天我需要你帮忙      什么事?
Jim, I need yourhelp today.Whatwith?

253
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,153
买东西 通水管
Shopping, the kitchen plughole'sblocked, 

254
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:13,153
修理草坪
the lawn needs mowing.

255
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,710
亲爱的 我还有这么多盒重要文件呢      先放着
I've got all these boxes to do.They can wait.

256
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,672
安妮 也许你没发现 我是内阁大臣
Annie, I am a Cabinet Minister.

257
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,990
女王政府的一员
A memberof Her Majesty's Government.

258
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,878
这可是神圣的工作
It's a fairly important job.

259
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,476
但你有2万3千名公务员打下手 我可没有
But you have 23.000 civil servantsto help you, I haven't.

260
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,755
待会再弄备忘录 马上去修水管
Play with yourmemos later,the drains need fixing now.

261
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,234
喂 露西
Oh, Lucy!

262
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,433
果酱都涂到内阁报告上来了
You've got marmaladeall overmy cabinet papers.

263
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
我的天
Oh, God.

264
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,240
这下好 黄油也抹上去了 拿抹布来
Now I've got butteron them.Get a cloth.

265
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,958
自己动手      露西
Get it yourself.Lucy.

266
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,432
家里可不是白厅
You're not in Whitehall now.

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,878
"是 大臣""当然 大臣""都听您的"
"Yes, Minister", "Certainly","Just as you say".

268
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,031
"能舔您的靴子吗 大臣?"
"May I lick yourboots, Minister?"

269
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,315
露西宝贝 这么说不公平
That's not fair.

270
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,711
公务员对你爸挺恭敬的没错
Those Civil Servants may bealways kowtowing to Daddy,

271
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,269
不过可没把他放在眼里
but they nevertakeany notice ofhim.

272
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,879
告诉你 我刚在部里打了一场胜仗
I've justwon a victoryin my Department.

273
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,598
看看这些盒子
Look at all those boxes.

274
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,073
我就是说这个
That's what I mean.

275
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,239
本来你战胜汉弗莱了 这回又被他压倒了
You were better, now they'vedone a snow job on you again.

276
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,198
绝对没有 这是我要来的      为什么?
Not at all, I asked forall this.Why?

277
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,030
昨天汉弗莱拐弯抹角地说
Humphrey said,"There are some things

278
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,634
"有些事情大臣还是不知道的好"
it's betterfora Ministernot to know".

279
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,310
他对我隐瞒信息 很可能是重要信息
He's witholding things forme,probably important things.

280
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,109
于是我命令他事无巨细都向我报告
So I have insisted that I am toldeverything that goes on.

281
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,879
你到底怎么当上内阁大臣的?
How did you get to bea Cabinet Minister?

282
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,519
真是傻得不透气
You're such a clot.

283
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,432
什么?      还看不出?
What?Don't you see?

284
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,637
你正好上了汉弗莱的当 他肯定高兴坏了
You've playedright into Humphrey's hands.

285
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,714
你主动朝他要来一堆垃圾信息
An open invitation to swamp youwith useless information.

286
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,154
我可不同意
I don't think so.

287
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,197
好吧 都有什么?
What's in that box,for instance?

288
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,999
技术报告 可行性研究
Technical reports,feasibility studies,

289
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,116
各委员会过往记录
past papersof assorted committees,

290
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,671
文具申领单...
stationery requisitions...

291
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,671
活见鬼
Oh, damnation.

292
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,590
赢不了他们 这是个悖论 对不对?
You can'twin.It's Catch 22, isn't it?

293
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,914
信息少了 看不到真相
So little informationyou don't know the facts,

294
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,877
信息多了 又不得要领
orso much you can't find them.

295
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,236
他们就让你原地打转
They've got yougoing and coming.

296
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,960
有篇写你的文章 爸爸      我读过了
There's a story about you here.I've read it.

297
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,032
"屠獾凶手哈克"      你爸读过了 亲爱的
"Hacker, The Badger Butcher".Daddy's read it.

298
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,670
讲什么的?      全是胡话
What's all this then?Lot of rubbish.

299
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,353
"哈克承认取消海华树林的"
"Hackeradmitted that removingprotected status

300
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,796
"保护区资格会导致獾群覆灭"
from Hayward's Spinney meanthe end of the badgercolony".

301
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,870
"英国动物保护组织发言人称"
"A spokesman forthe Preservationof British Wildlife said:

302
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,959
"哈克给獾判了死刑"
"Hackerhas signedthe badger's death warrant".

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,078
第一 我不是什么屠凶...屠獾手
One: I am not a babgerb...badgerbutcher...

304
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,472
管他是什么
Whatever it is.

305
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,229
第二 獾不是濒危种族
Two: Badgers are notan endangered species.

306
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,750
第三 取消保护区资格
Three: The removalof protected status

307
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,354
并不是要枪毙所有的獾
does not meanall the badgers will be shot.

308
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,114
第四 就算牺牲几只獾 那也是
And four: If a fewbadgersdie forthe sake

309
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,955
为了保护英国自然遗产的宏伟目标 完毕
of a masterplan thatwill saveBritain's natural heritage, tough.

310
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,917
宏伟目标啊 元首阁下
A masterplan, mein Fhrer.

311
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,469
为达目的不择手段吗?      露西...
The end justifies the means?Lucy...

312
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,756
不就欺负獾们不能投票吗
It's because badgers can't vote.

313
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,276
要是獾有投票权 你才不会消灭它们
Lfbadgers had votes, youwouldn't be exterminating them.

314
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,194
你会在树林里握它们爪子 抱它们崽子
You'd be at Hayward's Spinney,shaking paws, and kissing cubs...

315
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,113
像对选民一样拍他们马屁
Ingratiating yourselfthe way you always do.

316
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,557
露西 别没大没小的      是真的 对吧?
Not a nice thing to say.It's true, isn't it?

317
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,349
对 可你爸是政客 政客就是拍马屁的嘛
Yes, but Daddy's in politics.He has to be ingratiating.

318
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,954
多谢了 亲爱的      不能这样下去
Thank you very much.It's got to be stopped.

319
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,396
晚了 已经决议了      我来阻止它
The decision has been taken.I'm going to stop it.

320
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,917
好办 先提名当候选人
Quite simple, get yourselfadopted as a candidate,

321
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,231
赢得普选 再做后座议员
win a general election,serve on the back benches,

322
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,958
最后当上大臣 撤销法案 没问题
become a Ministerand repeal the act.

323
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,359
就是獾们等不了你
The badgers might begetting on a bit by then.

324
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,519
助理秘书直接向大臣报告?
Assistant Secretariesreporting to the Minister!

325
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
我明白
I know.

326
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,274
他以为他是谁?公务员吗?
Does he thinkhe is a civil servant?

327
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,190
政客都是自大狂
The arroganceof these politicians!

328
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,594
啊 伯纳
Ah, Bernard.

329
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
谢谢
Thank you.

330
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,913
好
Yes.

331
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,395
好
Yes.

332
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,195
好
Yes.

333
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,748
好
Yes.

334
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,039
好
Yes.

335
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,675
非常好
Fine.

336
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,118
最后这份可以给大臣看 伯纳
You can show that last oneto the Minister.

337
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,157
他会安静好一会的
He'll be quiet fora bit.

338
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,038
还有事吗 伯纳?
Is something the matter?

339
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,832
这个 只是...
Well, it's just that...

340
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,550
我越来越担心
I've been increasinglyworried about

341
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,711
把事情瞒着大臣
keeping things backfrom the Minister.

342
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,871
我先失陪...      不用不用
Shall I...No, no, no.

343
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,439
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

344
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,354
如果他想了解情况 为什么不告诉他?
Why shouldn't he be allowedto know things ifhe wants to?

345
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,953
傻小子
Silly Boy!

346
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,716
伯纳 我国政府的运作方式在于
Bernard, this country is governedby Ministers making decisions

347
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,075
大臣从我们提供的方案中
from the variousalternative proposals

348
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,629
遴选决策 对吧?      对啊
thatwe offerthem, is it not?Oh, yes.

349
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,915
所以
Well...

350
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,350
如果他们掌握了事实
If they had all the facts,

351
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,432
他们会看到其它可能性
they'd see all sortsof otherpossibilities.

352
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,790
甚至会自己提出方案来
They might even formulatetheirown plans

353
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,793
而不从我们那两三个方案里选
instead of choosing betweenthe ones thatwe put up.

354
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,916
那不行吗?      那不行吗!
Would that matter?Would it matter!

355
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
可是为什么?
But why?

356
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,789
由我们自己来编写提案
As long as we can formulateourown proposals, we can

357
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,829
能引导他们作出正确决策
guide themto the correct decision.

358
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,831
能吗?怎么引导?
Can we? How?

359
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,869
就像变戏法
It's like a conjuror.

360
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,073
"三张牌"魔术
The Three Card Trick.

361
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,630
随便挑一张 最后总挑中你要的那张
"Take any card", they pickthe one that you intend.

362
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,588
我们这个叫"四字诀"
Ours is the fourword trick.

363
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,272
有四个词能让大臣采纳提案
There are fourwords if you wanta Ministerto accept a proposal.

364
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,716
快捷 简单 时兴 便宜
Quick. Simple. Popular. Cheap.

365
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,989
还有四个词 能让提案
And there are fourwordsfora proposal

366
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,912
被大臣否决
if you want it thrown out.

367
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,671
复杂 耗时 昂贵 争议
Complicated. Lengthy.Expensive. Controversial.

368
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,916
要彻底排除大臣采纳的可能性
And to be really surethe Ministerdoesn't accept it,

369
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,230
就得说这决定"有魄力"
you say the decisionis courageous.

370
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,072
比"争议"还惨?
Worse than "controversial".

371
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,754
"争议"只表示"会失去部分选票"
"Controversial" means"this'll lose yourvotes".

372
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,992
"魄力"表示"会失掉整个大选"
"Courageous" means"this will lose you the election".

373
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,469
你看 如果他们掌握的不是选项而是事实
You see, if they have all the factsinstead of just the options

374
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,990
他们可要自己动脑子了
they might start thinkingforthemselves!

375
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,159
这个体制有用?      有用?
And the system works?Works?

376
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,075
这是今日英国的基石
It's made Britainwhat she is today.

377
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,074
哦 对 我明白了
Oh, yes. I see. Yes.

378
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,789
你那位怎样 小汉?      我给他一堆文件看
What about yourman?I'm giving him plenty to read.

379
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,552
你不该向他挑明
Shouldn't you showhim

380
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,439
无知有时候也是一种美德么?
the positive virtuesofbeing kept ignorant?

381
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,990
要是他从政20年连这都不懂...
Lfhe doesn't know thatafter 20 years as a politician...

382
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,199
有问题吗 伯纳?      是的 公文盒里有封信
You look worried, Bernard.I've just found this letter.

383
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,237
怎么?      不知道该不该拆
I don't knowif I should open it.

384
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,799
你知道规定
You know the rules.

385
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,033
私人秘书可以拆阅各级机密 包括顶极
Private secretaries shall openall classifications up to Top Secret.

386
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,158
只有标"亲启"的不能拆
Only letters marked "personal"shall remain unopened,

387
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,629
除非大臣另作指示
unless the Ministerorders otherwise.

388
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,114
那"爸爸"呢?
What about Daddy?

389
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,674
我不知道这和你父亲有何关系
Where does yourfathercome into this?

390
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,998
不是 写着"爸爸收""紧急"
No. To "Daddy". "Urgent".

391
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,639
写了"亲启"没有?      没
Does it say"Personal"?No.

392
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,711
按照规定 那就得拆了
Well then, it must be opened.

393
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,675
是大臣的女儿写的      真没料到
It's from the Minister's daughter.You astound me.

394
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,199
后院起火啦?
Trouble at the mill.

395
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,874
哈克小姐要参加护獾运动
Miss Hackerwill jointhe badgerprotest.

396
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,315
不是结束了嘛      她和她男朋友发起的
I thought itwas over.She and herboyfriend.

397
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,392
在海华树林 24小时"拯救獾群"抗议
A 24 hour"Save the badgers"vigil in Hayward's Spinney

398
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,312
直到恢复保护区
unless protection is restored.

399
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,677
他们下午5点通报媒体
And they announcing itto the press at 5.00 p.m.

400
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,991
"大臣之女抗议屠獾"
"Minister's daughterin badgerprotest vigil".

401
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,679
有点尴尬 不太严重
A little embarrassing,but not too serious.

402
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,389
汉弗莱爵士 大臣可能不止有点尴尬
The Ministerwill bemore than a little embarrassed.

403
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,836
怎么?      "大臣之女裸体抗议屠獾"
"Minister's daughter in nudebadgerprotest vigil".

404
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,435
什么
What!

405
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,875
对 哈克小姐和她男朋友会...
Miss Hackerand herboyfriend will be...

406
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,191
也就是说 他们不会...
that is, will not not be...I mean...

407
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,557
他们要脱光 伯纳?      对 汉弗莱爵士
Do you mean starkers, Bernard?Yes, Sir Humphrey.

408
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,952
那就麻烦了      特别是这么冷的天
A different complexion on it.Especially in this weather.

409
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,878
按记者的话说 这叫特大新闻
Put in crude journalistic terms,this makes it a big story.

410
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,917
头版 附照片
Front page: with photograph.

411
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,394
你好啊 汉弗莱
Hello, Humphrey.

412
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,473
有什么事么?
Something the matter?

413
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
什么?
Well?

414
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,354
有件小事 比较尴尬 大臣
Shall we say a slightembarrassment, Minister?

415
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
多小的事?
How slight?

416
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,915
即使尽量避免夸大事实
Withoutwishing in any senseto overstate the case

417
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,390
或者危言耸听 状况仍然...
orcause undue alarm,nevertheless, the fact remains...

418
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,073
得了 汉弗莱 说吧
Come on! Outwith it.

419
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,639
大臣 我要坦白一件事      这倒新鲜
I have a confession to make.That's a change.

420
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,949
说吧 汉弗莱 敞开胸怀吧
Well, come on, Humphrey,make a clean breast of it.

421
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,432
最好不要这么形容 大臣
Not the happiest of phrasesunderthe circumstances.

422
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,109
怎么讲?
How do you mean?

423
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,589
我必须承认 獾群危机
I have to confessthat the badgers

424
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,116
比我们预想的要大
may be a somewhat biggerstorythan we thought.

425
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,875
别告诉我獾要下崽了
Don't tell methey're going to have kittens.

426
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,197
问题不在獾的崽子 大臣
It is not the badgerswho are going to have kittens.

427
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,148
海华树林会有个24小时抗议
There'll be a 24 hourprotest vigilin Hayward's Spinney.

428
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,517
你说那不算新闻      这回不太一样
Thatwouldn't be newsworthy.This is slightly different.

429
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,591
参加者包括
It's to be conducted...

430
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,279
一名女学生及其男友
by a girl studentand herboyfriend.

431
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,872
就他们两个?      对
Just the two of them?Yes.

432
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,395
谁管他们 一对闲人
They don't matter.A pairof layabouts.

433
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,233
有些人可能非管不可      胡说 伯纳
They might matterto some people.Nonsense.

434
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,472
这些学生只想露露脸
These students arejust exhibitionists.

435
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,473
这回露的可不止是脸
In this case they havesomething to exhibit.

436
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,673
怎么讲?      他们要裸体抗议
How do you mean?It's to be a nude protest vigil.

437
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,989
是这样
I see.

438
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,073
会上头版的      可不是
Thatwould make the front pages!Yes, quite so.

439
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,750
不能让媒体知道
The press just mustn't find out.

440
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,992
真不明白这些学生什么毛病
I don't knowwhat gets into these students.

441
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,118
真可怕 不要脸      确实 大臣
It's appalling. They're shameless.Indeed, Minister.

442
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,872
你知道 都是家长的错
It's theirparents.

443
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,197
父母养而不教
They don't bring them upproperly.

444
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,396
由他们撒野 给他们
Just let them run wildand feed them

445
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,630
灌输些反社会思想
all this antiestablishmentnonsense.

446
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,598
也许不全是家长的错
Perhaps it isn't entirelythe parents fault.

447
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,159
当然是家长的错
Of course it is!

448
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,313
威信啊 汉弗莱
Authority, Humphrey.

449
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,198
看这些学生就知道
All this is an indictment

450
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,635
父母不懂管教和纪律
of theirparent's lackof discipline.

451
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,398
导致孩子坑害无辜的人 比如我
So they just take it outon innocent people like me.

452
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,632
他们是谁?      知道那位小姐的名字
Who are they?We know the young lady's name.

453
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,597
还小姐呢 是谁?
Lady!Who is she?

454
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,196
她似乎叫哈克小姐
It seems she's a Miss Hacker.

455
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,392
哈克...哦 跟我一样
Hacker... oh, that's my name.

456
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,673
还真巧
That's a coincidence.

457
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,471
不完全是巧合
Not a complete coincidence.

458
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,911
不是...露西吧?
Not... not Lucy?

459
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,075
我的天呐
Oh, my God!

460
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,833
我的天呐
Oh, my God!

461
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,158
您看 她10分钟之内会来电话
She will be telephoningin ten minutes time.

462
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,952
也许媒体不感兴趣?没指望的...
Perhaps the press won't beall that interested? No, no...

463
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,912
媒体真会跑去沃里克郡?
Butwill they go all the wayup to Warwickshire?

464
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,879
为这种故事
Fora story like this,

465
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,838
恐怕他们不惜一路跑到南极
they'll go all the wayto the South Pole.

466
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,992
这可不能上报 提建议啊 汉弗莱
This story must be killed.Advise me, Humphrey.

467
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,352
大臣 管教管教如何?
What abouta little parental discipline?

468
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,589
别傻了
Don't be silly.

469
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,719
也许可以让她服理      她是学社会学的 伯纳
Make her listen to reason.She's a sociology student.

470
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,238
让您夫人把她锁起来?
Perhaps Mrs. Hackercould lock her in herroom?

471
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,073
安妮出差去了 报警如何?
Annie's out atwork.What about the police?

472
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,073
"大臣报警镇压裸体女儿"
"Ministersets policeon nude daughter".

473
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,800
这故事也差不了多少 大臣
I'm not sure that completelykills the story.

474
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,873
一定有办法      等我看看档案...
There must be something.Perhaps if I look at the files...

475
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,793
好呀 我女儿就要上《太阳报》头版了
My daughter's about to getpage one of the Sun,

476
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,236
大概还要上第三版 你就知道看文件
and probably page three,and you just think of the files.

477
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,834
不过...      都在外面
Nevertheless...They're all out there.

478
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,714
会以什么角度报导呢?      广角镜头
What angle they'll take?Wide angle.

479
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,594
反对党该高兴了
Oppositionwill have fun with this.

480
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,195
"英雄之父有何感言?"
"Does the proud fatherwish to make a statement?".

481
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,920
"哈克一家急于曝光?"
"Is the Hackerfamily gettingtoo much exposure?".

482
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,390
"大臣会掩盖起来吗?"
"Is the Ministertryingto conduct a coverup?".

483
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,438
"一家不治 何以治部?"
"Does he run his Departmentbetterthan his family?".

484
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,269
你要我说是汉弗莱在治理这个部?
You'd like me to tell themthat Humphrey runs it?

485
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,159
当然不会 大臣 我是您的私人秘书
No, of course not.I am your Private Secretary.

486
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,959
你是说 每到紧急时刻
Do you meanthat when the chips are down,

487
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,997
你站我这边 不是汉弗莱那边?
you're on my side,not Humphrey's?

488
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,958
大臣 我的工作就是避免这种紧急时刻
Minister, it's my job to seethe chips stay up.

489
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
喂?
Hello?

490
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,395
请找哈克先生 我是他女儿
Can I speak to Mr. Hacker?It's his daughter.

491
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,118
找您的 大臣
It's foryou, Minister.

492
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,553
露西 你好 亲爱的
Lucy. Hello, darling.

493
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,313
你好 爸爸      我收到信了
Hello, Daddy.I got yournote.

494
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,471
吓我一跳 还以为你当真的呢
Fora momentI thought itwas serious.

495
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,394
是当真的 性命攸观
It is serious.It's deadly serious.

496
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,358
彼得和我马上通报媒体
Pete and I are just goingto ring the press,

497
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,431
然后去树林
then we're off to the Spinney.

498
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,875
千万别 想想后果啊
Don't do that!Think of the damage.

499
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,268
什么后果?
What damage?

500
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,953
这个...会损害我
Well... to me.

501
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,872
你?果然如此
To you? Isn't that typical?

502
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,632
对獾的损害又怎么说?
What about damageto badgers?

503
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,836
你又不会被消灭
You're not goingto be exterminated.

504
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,991
从某种意义上说 是的
Well, in a sense, yes.

505
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,151
那好 你知道该怎么做了
Then you knowwhat to do.

506
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,751
10秒...      等等 等等
Ten...Look... Look...

507
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,069
9...      露西 别
Nine...Lucy, don't...

508
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,593
8...      露西
Eight...Lucy!

509
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,069
大臣 请让我和小姐说句话
If I could have a wordwith the young lady.

510
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,800
汉弗莱・阿普比爵士有话要说      有新进展
Sir Humphrey Applebywants a word with you.

511
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,077
有新进展      6...5...
A new development.Six... five...

512
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,952
哈克小姐 您好吗?
Miss Hacker...Ah, how do you do?

513
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,992
我是汉弗莱・阿普比
Humphrey Appleby here.

514
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,631
哈克先生的常任秘书      还有5秒
Mr. Hacker's Permanent Secretary.Five and holding.

515
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,597
请听我说一句 小姐
If I could just have a word.

516
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,000
我刚看到政府
I have just seen the latest report

517
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,594
督察员最新报告
from the Government's inspectors,

518
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,479
这件事又有新进展
which throws new lighton the issue.

519
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
怎么?
Why?

520
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,231
显然树林里并没有獾群
Apparently there isno badgercolony in Spinney.

521
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,799
报告中写道
Now, it says here

522
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,268
"最后一次发现獾的粪便和洞穴"
"Last evidence ofbadgerdroppings, freshly turned earth

523
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,396
"是在11年前"
was recordedeleven years ago".

524
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,629
可报纸上...
But the papers...

525
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,998
显然那篇报导是地产商炮制的
Apparently the story was fedto them by a property developer.

526
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,712
地产商?      显然 市政厅计划
Property developer?Yes. The Council has plans

527
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,190
用树林修建成人教育学院
to use the spinneyfora new Collegeof Further Education,

528
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,796
而地产商想建写字楼和高级公寓
and the developerwants itforoffices and luxuryflats.

529
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,236
可如果被保护着 他也用不了
Well, if it's protectedhe won't be able to.

530
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,391
市政厅也用不了
And, norwill the Council.

531
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,792
他盘算好市政厅会把经费转走
And he knows they'll usethe moneyforsomething else,

532
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,510
一年之后他再宣传根本没有獾
then he can establishthat there's no badgercolony,

533
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,150
取消保护区 兴建写字楼
get the protection orderremovedand build his offices.

534
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,673
这都是司空见惯了
It's common practice.

535
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,990
就是说树林里根本没有野生动物?
So there isn't any wildlifein the spinney at all?

536
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,516
有倒是有 那里被伍顿沃文地区
Well, there is some.It's been used as a rubbish dump

537
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,231
用作垃圾场 所以耗子不少
by people from Wootton Wawen,so there're lots of rats.

538
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,117
耗子?      对 不下几千只
Rats?Yes. Several thousand, actually.

539
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,630
怎么说它们也算野生动物吧?
They are wildlife too,in theirway, aren't they?

540
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,638
便宜了地产商就可惜了
Itwould be a pity to playinto the developer's hands.

541
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,837
对 我同意
Yes, I suppose itwould.

542
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,390
我非常敬佩您的远见和献身精神
Yes, I very much respectyourviews and yourcommitment.

543
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,437
还要找大臣说话吗?
Would you like to speakto the Minister?

544
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,275
不 不用了 算了吧
No, that's all right.Oh, well. Forget it then.

545
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,234
汉弗莱 我诚心向你道歉
Humphrey!I take it all back!

546
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,278
没什么 大臣 都写在档案里
Itwas nothing, Minister.Itwas all in the files.

547
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,919
地产商
A property developer!

548
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,992
这些奸商...给我看看文件
The cunning devils...Let me look at the file!

549
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,837
大臣 您不会感兴趣的
I don't thinkyou'd find them interesting.

550
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,071
给我看看      不 我认为您还是...
Let me have a look.No, I don't think you'd...

551
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,514
汉弗莱
Humphrey!

552
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,471
你说的是真的吧?
Itwas true, wasn't it?

553
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,436
汉弗莱 你给露西讲的那一套里
Was there one word of truthin that whole story

554
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,033
有一句真话么?
you told to Lucy?

555
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,352
大臣 您真想要我回答?
Do you really want meto answerthat question?

556
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,594
不 我...
No.

557
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,836
还是算了      正是
I don't think I do.Quite so.

558
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,789
也许某些事情 大臣还是不知道的好
Perhaps there're some thingsit is betterfora Ministernot to know.
