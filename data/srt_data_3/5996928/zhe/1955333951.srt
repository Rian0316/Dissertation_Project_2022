00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:03,533
已经挺晚的了
It's pretty late.

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:05,735
不过 我还来得及再做几次
You think I've got time to run some more simulations

3
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:06,936
冷却系统的模拟吗?
on the cooling system?

4
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:08,204
来得及 我还在纠结
Sure, I'm still figuring out

5
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:09,405
热声扩张器呢
the thermo-acoustic expander.

6
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:10,506
你们先忙着吧
Oh, while you do that

7
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:13,843
我需要让脑脊液
I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid

8
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:17,046
滋润大脑里的每一个细胞 清除这一天飞速运转所产生的
through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products

9
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:18,915
新陈代谢副产物
of the day's thoughts.

10
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,950
什么鬼?
What?

11
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,518
这叫睡眠 我该睡觉了
It's called sleep and it's my bedtime.

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,320
晚安 么么哒
Nighty-night, y'all.

13
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:26,623
喂 你不许走
Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere.

14
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,858
都是因为你 不然我们也不只有两个月的期限
We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force

15
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,893
然后上交给国家
because of you.

16
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:32,662
我知道 我当时也在
I know, I was there.

17
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:34,163
那你就给我清醒点!
Well, wake up!

18
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,266
我们要习惯刷夜了
We're gonna put in a lot of late nights.

19
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,600
刷到多晚?
How late?

20
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:40,837
我怎么知道 半夜吧 或者凌晨一点
Well, I don't know, midnight, 1:00.

21
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:41,838
凌晨一点?
One o'clock?

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,107
我又不是夜猫子
I'm not a raccoon.

23
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:47,277
累了的话就去喝咖啡
If you're tired, have some coffee.

24
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:48,745
我才不喝咖啡 要喝也是你喝
What? You have some coffee.

25
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:50,446
我正喝着呢!
I am having coffee!

26
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:52,181
你这么暴躁就是因为咖啡因!
And look how irritable it's making you!

27
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:54,217
别吵了!
Guys!

28
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,085
现在吵架一点用都没有
We're not gonna get anything done if we start fighting.

29
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:58,254
你能不能再忍一忍?
Now, can you please try to soldier through?

30
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:00,957
好啵
Fine.

31
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,840
我真的坚持不住了
I don't think I can go much longer.

32
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:19,909
才过去三分半钟! 你清醒点!
It's been three and a half minutes, wake up!

00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:53,140
我昨晚做噩梦 梦见我最好的朋友变成了暴君
I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant

45
00:01:53,142 --> 00:01:55,476
逼我熬夜工作
and forced me to stay up all night to work.

46
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:57,745
我做的梦倒是挺好的 昨天我把你扔上床的时候
Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed,

47
00:01:57,747 --> 00:02:01,081
故意把你的脑袋撞到了墙上 我还不厚道地笑了
I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.

48
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,750
嗨 早上好
Good morning.

49
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:03,818
你们在干嘛?
What is this?

50
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,286
昨天一晚上都没看到你们
Well, we didn't see you last night,

51
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:06,520
今天估计也一样
we're not gonna see you today,

52
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:08,889
所以我们应该一起吃个早饭
so we thought we could have breakfast together.

53
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:09,890
你们太贤惠了
Oh, that is so nice.

54
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:13,227
嗷 头很疼的!
Ow, it does hurt!

55
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,563
那你们今天准备干点什么?
So, what are you guys gonna do today?

56
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:16,564
今天下午Sheldon本来应该
Well, Sheldon was supposed to go

57
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,265
陪我去参加聚会的
to this party with me this afternoon,

58
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,467
不过现在看来他是去不了啦
but I don't think that's happening.

59
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:21,435
本来我就没打算去
Oh, that was never happening.

60
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,103
带我去吧
Oh, I'll go.

61
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:24,872
我超喜欢聚会
I like a party.

62
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,907
我们说的这个不是你想象中那种趴体
Well, to be honest, it's not like a "party" party,

63
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,576
更像是不同领域的科学家们
it's more like a gathering

64
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,177
聚在一起讨论他们的工作
where scientists of different disciplines get together

65
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,645
再了解一下其他领域的
to share their work and keep current

66
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,047
最新科研进展
on what's going on in other fields.

67
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,416
我不应该说这是个聚会的 我的锅
I don't know why I called it a party, sorry.

68
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:37,318
无所谓啦 带我去吧
It's okay, I'll still go.

69
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,086
你不会觉得无聊嘛?
You don't think you'll be bored?

70
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:40,955
一边喝酒 一边装作在听人们说
Oh, I'll have some wine and listen to people go on

71
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,189
我听不懂的东西
about crap I don't understand.

72
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,123
讲真 这和我每天的工作
I mean, how is it any different

73
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,793
有什么区别吗?
than every single day of my life?

74
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:47,962
我不去
I won't be there.

75
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:49,446
他不去的话 那这就真是个聚会了
Look at that, it is a party.

76
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:54,335
对不起 我整个周末都要加班
Sorry I have to work all weekend.

77
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:55,803
没事哒
It's okay.

78
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:58,005
谢谢你给我做早餐
Thanks again for breakfast.

79
00:02:58,007 --> 00:02:59,340
我一晚上都没见到你
Well, I didn't get to see you last night.

80
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:01,709
我能做的也就只有这些了
It was the least I could do.

81
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:04,411
你不应该把大门密码设成他生日的
You shouldn't have made the alarm code his birthday.

82
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:09,650
我们今天干什么?
So, what should we do today?

83
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:11,085
多谢你啦 
Oh, I appreciate it,

84
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:12,753
不过你不用一整天都陪着我的
but you don't have to spend your day off with me.

85
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:14,188
没关系啊
Well, I don't mind.

86
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,490
对了 你想不想去商场看看婴儿用品?
Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?

87
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:17,691
不是很想
Not really.

88
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:19,159
来嘛 我们可以分一个椒盐饼干
Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel

89
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:23,364
感受一下路边保守的老奶奶歧视我们的眼神
and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.

90
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,599
圣诞节带Howard去见我奶奶的时候
I get enough of that when I take Howard

91
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,468
我就受够那种眼神了
to my grandmother's for Christmas.

92
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,468
{\an8}Howard是犹太人

93
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,570
唔
Oh,

94
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:32,606
对了 不如我们开始收拾婴儿房吧?
I know, why don't we get started on clearing out the baby's room?

95
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:34,008
现在就开始会不会太早了?
Isn't it a little early for that?

96
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,843
终究还是要做的
You have to get to it eventually.

97
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:38,579
那里堆满了各种垃圾 真是不好意思
Oh, there's so much junk in there, it's embarrassing.

98
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:40,781
我在旁边的时候你怎么能觉得不好意思呢?
How can you be embarrassed around me?

99
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:43,017
你生孩子的时候我可是要在你旁边帮你喊加油的
I'm gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.

100
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:52,126
我并不这么认为
I don't think you are.

101
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,461
你之前还觉得我今天早上不会出现在厨房里呢
You didn't think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning,

102
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:56,931
看看现在
yet here I am.

103
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,005
嗨 大宝贝
Psst, hey, kid.

104
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,206
什么?
Huh, what?

105
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:10,744
你看上去累惨了
You look tired.

106
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:12,680
来点功能饮料怎么样?
Why don't you have an energy drink?

107
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:14,715
大家都喝的
Everyone's doing it.

108
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:18,953
不了 谢谢你 这种饮料里有咖啡因
Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.

109
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,187
噢 不好意思
Oh, sorry,

110
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:22,122
我以为你很酷
I thought you were cool.

111
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:25,192
宝宝确实酷
I am cool.

112

这是Yoo-hoo
This is Yoo-hoo,

113
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:29,697
好喝的淡味版巧克力牛奶
chocolate milk's delicious watery cousin.

114
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,198
好吧
All right.

115
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,101
但如果你想体会拥有超能力的感觉的话
But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers,

116
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:35,903
就试试这个吧
try one of these.

117
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:39,073
超级英雄通过摄入化学物质来增强能力?
Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?

118
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:40,207
不然呢
You bet.

119
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,810
你知道绿巨人为什么那么壮吗?
You know why Hulk is so strong?

120
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:44,311
来点类固醇就行
Steroids.

121
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:48,415
你知道为什么蝙蝠侠大半夜在外面乱晃
You know why Batman wanders around at night

122
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,618
还打架吗?
getting into fights?

123
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,919
全是威士忌的功劳
Scotch.

124
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:57,391
我现在有巨量的工作要做
I am facing a great deal of work.

125
00:04:57,393 --> 00:05:01,695
而且我确实更偏爱名人喜欢的东西
And I do like things better when famous people also like them.

126
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:03,831
给你
Here.

127
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,965
我请
It's on the house.

128
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:08,936
第一罐还免费?
The first one's free?

129
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:11,538
闪电侠 你是怎么赚钱的?

131

我买了漫威的股票

132
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:20,314
嗨 Bert
Hi, Bert.

Hey, come on in.

136
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,819
我去放点摇滚乐
I'll gonna go turn on some rock music.

137
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,122
{\an8} rock又可以译作石头

138
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,122
这是个地质学的笑话
That's a geology joke.

139
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,556
Bert是个地质学家
Bert's a geologist.

140
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:31,692
还是搞笑小能手哦
And a joker.

141
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,696
我们是来得有多早?
How early are we?

142
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:38,632
实际上我们已经迟到一小时了
Oh, actually, we're an hour late.

143
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:41,769
突然好希望Sheldon在这里啊
I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.

144
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,075
我都不知道从哪里下手
I don't even know where to begin.

145
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:51,011
在音乐之声里 Julie Andrews说过
Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says,

146
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:52,579
我们从头唱起
"Let's start at the very beginning.

147
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:54,882
 这样最是好记
A very good place to start."

148
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,651
我本来还打算从结尾处开始呢
Oh, I was gonna start at the end.

149
00:05:57,653 --> 00:05:59,153
真是谢谢你在这里啊
Thank God you're here.

150
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:04,725
首先要丢掉的东西就是你充满恶意的语气
Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.

151
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:07,861
抱歉
Sorry.

152
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:09,196
还是把这个留着吧
I should probably keep this

153
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:10,531
万一是个女儿
in case we have a girl.

154
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:11,665
挺不错的小房子啊
Oh, that's a nice one.

155
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,100
是你小时候的玩具?
Was it yours when you were little?

156
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:14,501
是我爸爸给我造的
My dad built it for me.

157
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,003
哇 真暖心啊
Wow, it's so cute.

158
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,006
这是丈夫 这是妻子
This was the husband and this was the wife.

159
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:20,607
他们一起外出历险
They'd go out on adventures together.

160
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:22,142
航海 滑雪
Cruises, skiing,

161
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:23,377
骑马
horseback riding.

162
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:27,081
也就是我把他们用胶带绑在狗身上
That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.

163
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,649
那他们有孩子吗?
Oh, and did they have kids?

164
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:31,085
有啊 但是为人父母 他们一点都不喜欢自己的孩子
They did, but the mommy and daddy didn't like them,

165
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,486
所以他们把孩子送去了孤儿院
so they shipped them off to an orphanage

166
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:34,888
我用鞋盒做的
I made out of a shoebox.

167
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,759
你这么说还真是让人"放心"啊
Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.

168
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:42,162
不是每个女孩都梦想着为人母的一天
Not every girl dreams about being a mom.

169
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:44,998
有的时候你觉得自己这辈子都不会要孩子
Sometimes you think you're never gonna have kids

170
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,967
但某一天你睁开眼睛就发现自己怀孕了
and one day you wake up and you're pregnant.

171
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,769
不管你的职业生涯现在是多么璀璨
And it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now

172
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,871
甚至你和你的老公以后那都不能去
and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere

173
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,974
被这狗孩子绑得死死的!
taped to a dog!

174
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,844
我居然因为这个翘了动感单车课
I skipped spin class for this.

175
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,916
为什么他去自动贩卖机
Why is it taking him so long

176
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:04,952
买个饮料要花这么久?
to get a drink out of a vending machine?

177
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:06,687
这个说来就话长了
Oh, it's complicated.

178
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,088
他觉得推开取物口的小门
He finds pushing that little door

179
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,291
把手伸进机器里的这个行为已经亲密得让他不舒服了
and reaching up into the machine uncomfortably intimate.

180
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:15,362
众爱卿 朕准备好开始工作了
Gentlemen, I am ready to work.

181
00:07:15,364 --> 00:07:18,132
引用火星救援的一句话 "我们好好科学一把"
To quote The Martian, "Let's science the feces out of this!"

182
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,900
我说的是那本书
That's The Martian the book

183
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:21,602
和电影 不是火星人马文
and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian.

184
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:22,903
再引用火星人马文的一句话
Although to quote Marvin the Martian,

185
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:24,171
"我将此星球
"I claim this planet

186
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:25,572
命名为火星"
in the name of Mars."

187
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:28,509
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

188
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,177
哦 我感觉好极了 简直不能更赞
Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better.

189
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:31,545
我刚刚第一次喝了功能性饮料
I had my first energy drink

190
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:32,980
啊感觉棒棒哒
and I feel great.

191
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:33,914
嘿 你们想摔跤玩吗?
Hey, you guys want to wrestle?

192
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,649
我们可以掰腕子 拇指摔跤 泥浆摔跤 相扑摔跤
We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo.

193
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:38,218
还是算了吧 我们不够胖 也没穿尿不湿
Nah, we're not fat enough, or wearing diapers.

194
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:42,489
这可是你说想让他清醒过来的
You wanted him awake.

195
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:59,382
我们是应该两个人说说话呢 还是应该去和大家聊天啊?
So should we talk to each other or mingle?

196
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,251
我不知道大家都去哪儿了
I don't know where everyone is.

197
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:02,285
嗯 我看
Yeah, I mean,

198
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,554
他这个体型吃掉一两个客人还是有可能的
I could see him eating one or two guests,

199
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:07,357
但是吃掉一整个派对的人还是差一点
but not a whole party.

200
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,592
诶 这个派对太糗了
Well, I guess this is kind of a bust.

201
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,327
你们不用接着等了
You don't have to stay.

202
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:13,563
我要开始打扫卫生了
I'm gonna start cleaning up.

203
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:14,898
好吧
Okay.

204
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,966
留他一个人在这儿我好内疚啊
I feel so bad about leaving him here.

205
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:20,603
哦哈哈 我刚刚也在想要是扔下你走了会怎么样
Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.

206
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:21,671
恩 听我说
Hey, listen,

207
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,973
你可不可以不和大学里的人
could you not say anything about this

208
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:25,708
说今天的事啊?
to the people at the university?

209
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,444
你知道的 因为...
You know, 'cause...

210
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:30,613
你是你啊 我就只是我 真是太丢人了
you're you and I'm me, and it's kind of embarrassing.

211
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,916
等一下 你刚刚说“你是你啊”是什么意思?
Wait, what do you mean "she's her"?

212
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:35,819
就是 你知道Amy是校区里最酷的女孩吧?
Well, you know how Amy's the coolest girl on campus, right?

213
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,554
- 不知道 - 不知道啊
- No. - No.

214
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:39,622
没错啊 大家都是这么想的
Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.

215
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,091
什么?
What?

216
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:45,995
你得了脚气都告诉我 但是这件事你跟我保密?
You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?

217
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:48,298
大概是因为我和Sheldon在一起吧
I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.

218
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,935
恩 其实 我觉得Sheldon是因为和你在一起 他才这么受欢迎的
Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's popular because he's dating you.

219
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:55,672
Sheldon什么时候受欢迎了?
Now Sheldon's popular?

220
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:58,274
什么情况啊?
What is happening?

221
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:03,079
要不我们休息下去吃午饭吧
Maybe we should break for lunch.

222
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:04,080
现在几点了?
What time is it?

223
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:10,920
根据世界上最差劲的布谷鸟钟 现在两点了
According to the world's worst cuckoo clock, it's 2:00.

224
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:13,289
我头好疼啊
My head hurts

225
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,425
而且我从来没这么累过
and I'm more tired than ever.

226
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:16,860
要不你还是回家吧?
Why don't you just go home?

227
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:18,461
不不 我可以的
No, I can do this.

228
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:22,031
我只是 只是需要再来一瓶功能性饮料
I just, I just need another energy drink.

229
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,867
哦 不要啊
Oh, no.

230
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,101
怎么了?
What?

231
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:26,603
我还想再喝一瓶
I want another one.

232
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:27,604
那怎么了?
So?

233
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:29,372
这是药物渴求
That's a craving.

234
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:32,408
是药物依赖的表现啊
That's a sign of chemical dependency.

235
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,943
你只喝了一瓶啊
You only had one.

236
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:35,078
哎 我知道
No, I know,

237
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,346
但是很多东西都是
but plenty of things are addictive

238
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:38,014
试了一次就上瘾了
after a single exposure.

239
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:42,018
比如说 可卡因 尼古丁 还有品客薯片
I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles.

240
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,988
只要打开了一桶 不吃完简直停不下来
You know once one pops one just can't stop.

241
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,557
药物依赖是不会这么快开始的
You can't develop a problem that fast.

242
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,791
我们打赌啊? 哦 好吧
You want to bet? Oh, great,

243
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:50,126
我还开始赌博上瘾了
now I'm addicted to gambling.

244
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:57,634
我们不能再这么浪费时间了
We can't afford to lose any more time.

245
00:09:57,636 --> 00:10:00,303
虽然说估计没什么用 但是有人试过
Well, this probably won't work, but has anyone ever tried

246
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:04,240
暴打他一顿把他打正常吗?
to just haul off and whoop the crazy out of him?

247
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:07,110
这个建议一点用都没有好嘛
That's not helpful.

248
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:09,712
想想觉得好有意思 但是还是一点用都没有啊 
It's fun to think about, but it's not helpful.

249
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,184
嘿 Sheldon 我们时间紧任务重
Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch.

250
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,752
没有你我们绝对做不完的
We can't do this without you.

251
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,253
你能不能振作起来啊?
Can you please pull it together?

252
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:19,322
对不起 嗯 我一定
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

253
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:21,357
谢谢
Thank you.

254
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:24,494
不过 如果我出现咖啡因戒断反应 
Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms

255
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,429
你们一定要包容我
of caffeine withdrawal.

256
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,731
没问题
No worries.

257
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,521
你们两个该洗澡了
You guys stink.

258
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:54,691
真对不起我刚才跟你发脾气了
Sorry I flipped out on you.

259
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:56,392
大概是荷尔蒙在作怪吧
I think it's just hormones.

260
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:57,894
你怀孕之前就很刻薄
I think you were mean before you were pregnant,

261
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,028
但是没事我不介意
but it's fine.

262
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:03,600
所以说 如果我们不收拾房间的话
So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room,

263
00:11:03,602 --> 00:11:06,002
要不我们给婴儿房选一个主题吧?
why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?

264
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:07,470
婴儿房真的需要有一个主题吗?
Does it really need one?

265
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,038
当然需要啦
Of course it does.

266
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,007
你小时候的房间没有主题吗?
Didn't your baby room have a theme?

267
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,042
恩 我小时候的房间也是我爸爸的办公室
Well, it doubled as my dad's office,

268
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:14,911
他是个警察 所以我猜
and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was

269
00:11:14,913 --> 00:11:17,447
主题就是血淋淋的谋杀现场照片
bloody homicide photos.

270
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:21,517
哦 我的房间是小熊维尼主题的
Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh.

271
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,454
但是...
But anyway...

272
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,689
要不我们先不用着急
why don't we just take a step back

273
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:27,857
先选定一个颜色怎么样?
and start with a color?

274
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,525
你看怎么样? 有很多漂亮的颜色啊
Right? There are so many amazing ones.

275
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:32,495
红色 蓝色 绿色 紫色...
Red, blue, green, purple...

276
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:34,130
你是想要念出全世界的颜色吗?
Are you just gonna name all the colors?

277
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:37,300
呃 你说话之后就不想了
Well, not now.

278
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,536
我一点都不关心婴儿房是什么颜色的
I don't care what color the room is.

279
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:42,538
好吧 嗯 我只是想帮帮你
Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.

280
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,674
然而 你在帮倒忙 别说了!
Well, you're not, so just drop it!

281
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,513
我显然很生气 你为什么不追过来?
I'm clearly upset. Why aren't you following me?

282
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:53,716
对不起! 对不起!
Sorry! Sorry!

283
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,620
当Amy开始用铬酸
And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid

284
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:00,590
和白醋清洗她的设备之后
and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment,

285
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:04,260
突然 所有人都开始这么做了
all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.

286
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:07,397
你引领了时尚潮流哈!
You trend setter!

287
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,700
只是在对的时机有了对的主意
Just the right idea at the right time.

288
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:13,202
好的 好的 所以Amy很棒 Sheldon很棒
Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool.

289
00:12:13,204 --> 00:12:15,405
给我讲讲Leonard 谁?
Tell me about Leonard. Who?

290
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,875
就是Leonard Hofstadter
Leonard Hofstadter.

291
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:22,011
哦 他呀 我觉得他挺好的
Oh, him. I guess he's all right.

292
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:24,514
显然他哄骗了一个很性感的姑娘嫁给他
Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.

293
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:28,551
那是我 我就是那个姑娘
That's me, I'm her.

294
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:29,719
他没有骗我
You know, he didn't trick me.

295
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:31,988
他只是追的我都累了
He just wore me down.

296
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,757
你俩确实应该是好朋友
It makes sense you two are friends.

297
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,859
性感的姑娘总是一起玩
I mean, hot girls always stick together.

298
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,030
你还说这不会是一个
And you thought this wasn't gonna be

299
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:43,466
好派对呢
a great party.

300
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:44,767
我都不知道
You know, I had no idea

301
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,737
加州理工跟我的高中这么像
Caltech is exactly like my high school.

302
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:49,706
嗯 并不是完全相似
Well, it's not exactly like it.

303
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,709
我们加州理工的人都十分聪明
We're all extremely smart.

304
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:55,978
哇哦... 你们这些受欢迎的姑娘这么高冷
Wow... you popular girls are mean.

305
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:01,751
我去拿点咖啡 你想要么?
I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?

306
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:04,454
啊 你真的要在我面前摄入咖啡因
Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me

307
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:06,656
就在我的生活要步入正轨的时候?
when I'm trying to get my life back on track?

308
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,960
啊 好吧 我们假装你确实有毛病
Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.

309
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:11,961
- 我确实有  - 你没有
- I do.  - You don't.

310
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:14,731
- 不 我有  - 不 你没有!
- Yeah, but I do.  - No, you don't!

311
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:15,965
但是我们假设你有
But let's say you do.

312
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,633
不要说你有 因为你没有!
And don't say you do, because you don't!

313
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:21,904
现在 你不觉得把自己投入到
Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself

314
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,273
工作中是解决它的最好办法么?
into your work would be the best way to deal with it?

315
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,609
解决什么? 你的毛病
With what? Your problem.

316
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:28,578
你不是说我没毛病
I thought I didn't have a problem.

317
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,585
看得我都尴尬了
That was painful to watch.

318
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:41,257
所以我们要去哪?
So where are we going?

319
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,692
我不知道
I don't know.

320
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:43,793
好吧
Okay.

321
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:47,463
我们像一对末路狂花
How Thelma and Louise of us.

322
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:50,700
Raj 我为什么什么都不在意呢?
Raj, why don't I care about anything?

323
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:51,701
什么?
I'm sorry?

324
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:53,536
这是我的孩子
It's my baby.

325
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,038
我该关心婴儿房和颜色
I should care about nurseries and colors,

326
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,174
但是我并不关心 我这是怎么了?
and I don't... what's wrong with me?

327
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:02,645
可能跟你小时候看的那些犯罪现场照片有关吧
Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.

328
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:04,847
我一直期待着开始感到兴奋
I keep waiting to feel excited,

329
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:06,182
但是我并没有
but it's not happening.

330
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:09,585
如果我永远都不兴奋怎么办?
What if it never happens?

331
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,654
Bernafdette 放松点 看
Bernadette, come on, look,

332
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:13,956
你想的太多了 好么?
you're overthinking this, okay?

333
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,159
你会成为一个棒极了的母亲
You're gonna be an amazing mom.

334
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:17,393
即使你不相信
Even if you don't believe it,

335
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:19,729
我知道你有母性的本能
I know you have maternal instincts.

336
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:22,231
有一次 我照顾我的弟弟们
Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers.

337
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,133
我们的邻居发现他们没穿衣服在后院里
Our neighbor found them naked in the backyard

338
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:25,701
吃蟋蟀
eating crickets.

339
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,005
快乐而且吃得很饱
Happy and well-fed.

340
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:31,073
你看 这是我从这个故事里获取的信息
You see, that's what I'm taking from that story.

341
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:38,147
Leonard 我能问你个问题么
Leonard, can I ask you a question?

342
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,649
是你本该搞得定的
Is it about the rotational symmetries

343
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:40,817
旋转对称的问题
you should be figuring out

344
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,418
还是你的伪咖啡因问题?
or your fake caffeine problem?

345
00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:47,623
Howard 我能问你个问题么?
Howard, can I ask you a question?

346
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,525
不能
No.

347
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,161
好吧 那我就直接说了
All right, I'll just toss this out to the room.

348
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:54,464
嗯 我在想
Um, I was thinking that the best way

349
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:56,199
对抗我的依赖性的最好方法
to fight my addiction is by

350
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:58,067
是让我逐步戒掉
weaning myself off in steps.

351
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,136
我找不到咖啡因贴片
Now, I couldn't find a caffeine patch,

352
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:02,538
但是我找到了一个
but I did find what claims to be

353
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,608
促进思考的咖啡因栓剂
a mind-boosting caffeine suppository.

354
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,743
好
Yeah.

355
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:09,779
你知道 关于直肠有个有趣的事实...
You know, the interesting fact about the rectum...

356
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:11,414
Sheldon啊!
Sheldon!

357
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:15,084
因为你 我们才有了空军给的
We are dealing with an impossible deadline

358
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:16,652
根本不可能完成的期限
from the Air Force because of you.

359
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:19,522
所以喝功能性饮料 不喝功能性饮料
So have an energy drink, don't have an energy drink.

360
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:20,857
用栓剂给你捅进去
Order suppositories and shove 'em

361
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:23,392
捅哪里 我都不在意!
wherever you want, I don't care!

362
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,329
不是捅的
You don't shove them.

363
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:28,130
它自带一个方便滑入的工具
They come with an easy-glide applicator.

364
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,503
好的 听我说
Right. Listen to me.

365
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,605
你把活干完之前我们什么都干不了
We can't do anything until you do your part.

366
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:38,174
所以快起来到白板前把活干完!
So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it!

367
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,409
我不能 不 你可以
I can't. Yes, you can.

368
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:42,211
不...
No...

369
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:44,380
我解不出来这数学
I can't figure out the math.

370
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:45,948
我努力了很多天了
I've been racking my brain for days,

371
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,918
可是我想不出来
and I've got nothing.

372
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:51,020
你讲真的吗?
Seriously?

373
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:52,622
我做不到
I can't do it.

374
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:54,724
我没我以为的那么聪明
I'm not as smart as I think I am.

375
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:58,261
我太抱歉了 这都是我的错
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

376
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,733
没关系的 我们总会有办法的
It's okay, we'll figure something out.

377
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:06,536
但要是我们就是没法子怎么办啊?
But what if we can't?

378
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:09,906
会没事的 你总会想通的
It'll be fine. You'll see.

379
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,246
喂Sheldon?
Sheldon?

380
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:21,951
伙计?
Buddy?

381
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,424
等孩子生出来了
When the baby gets here,

382
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:31,060
你得把这招教我
you gotta teach me that.

383
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:36,832
太感谢你了 Bert 今天太棒了
Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.

384
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,134
我的荣幸
My pleasure.

385
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:39,335
你们妹子想带盆
You girls want to take home

386
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,737
两加仑的土豆色拉回家吗?
a two-gallon tub of potato salad?

387
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,741
还是不用了吧 咱们
I think we're good.

388
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,543
好吧 感谢你们能来
Okay, well, thanks for coming by.

389
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:48,611
你们都是好人啊
You're nice people.

390
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:51,280
你也是啊 说真的
Well, so are you. In fact, you know what?

391
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:54,617
我们永远不会把你的好意当作想当岩的
We will never take you for granite.

392
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:57,720
听出来了吗? 花岗岩 想当岩?
Did you get that? Granite?

393
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:00,590
一点地质小玩笑啦
A little geology joke.

394
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:01,991
你们得走了
You need to leave.

395
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:03,326
我已经爱上你们两个人了
I'm in love with both of you now.

396
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:05,127
好吧 拜
Okay. Bye.

397
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:10,232
呃 停车
Uh, pull over.

398
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:11,968
什么? 为什么? 你在给谁打电话啊?
What? Why? Who are you calling?

399
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,170
你要跟Howard打我的小报告了 是不是?
You're gonna rat me out to Howard, aren't you?

400
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:17,506
你真是个告密的小婊砸 怪不得我不喜欢你呢
You're such a snitch, no wonder I don't like you.

401
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:21,744
喂喂 我是在跟我爸打电话 好吗?
Whoa, I'm calling my dad, okay?

402
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:23,980
他有跟怀孕的女士相处的经验
He's got experience dealing with pregnant ladies

403
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:25,381
因为他是妇科医生
because he's an OBGYN.

404
00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:27,116
也有跟蛇精病女士的相处经验
And experience with crazy ladies

405
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,451
因为他娶了我妈
because of my mom.

406
00:17:30,755 --> 00:17:32,355
哈喽 Rajesh
Hello, Rajesh.

407
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:33,756
你是打电话来要钱的吗?
Are you calling to ask for money?

408
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:34,690
什么? 不
What? No.

409
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:35,825
那你是打电话来要
Are you calling to ask for things

410
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,893
- 需要花钱的东西的吗?  - 不是的
- that cost money?  - No.

411
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:39,862
太好了 什么事?
Great. What's up?

412
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:42,398
这是我朋友 Bernadette
This is my friend, Bernadette.

413
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,600
她怀孕了 然后她有点担心
She's pregnant, and she's a bit worried,

414
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:46,202
所以我觉得说不定你能跟她谈谈
so I thought maybe you could talk to her.

415
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:48,771
当然 你有什么担心的呢?
Of course. What seems to be the trouble?

416
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:49,905
就是感觉不对劲
Something's wrong.

417
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:52,208
我一点也不在乎那些所有其他妈妈
I don't care about any of the baby stuff

418
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,610
都特别感兴趣的有关小宝宝的东西
every other mom is so into.

419
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:57,980
说实话 我都不确定我喜欢小宝宝
Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.

420
00:17:57,982 --> 00:17:59,982
听着 有些人天生就是喜欢小宝宝的
Look, some people are baby people,

421
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:02,051
而有些人天生就跟不爱跟小宝宝那么亲热
and some people are not baby people.

422
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:04,387
但这并不代表你不爱你自己的宝宝
It doesn't mean you won't love your own baby.

423
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:07,089
但是我以为我会更兴奋的
But I thought I'd be more excited.

424
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:10,893
哎呀 兴奋也什么都保证不了啊
Oh, being excited isn't a guarantee of anything.

425
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:13,896
Rajesh的妈妈怀他的时候可兴奋了
Rajesh's mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him.

426
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:17,333
他生出来以后做什么事 他妈妈都宠着他
After he was born, she doted on his every move.

427
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:18,601
但你知道后来怎么了吗?
And you know what happened?

428
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:20,803
他深深地伤了他妈妈的心 跑到了半个世界之外
He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world,

429
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,772
还只跟穷鬼白人女谈恋爱
and dates only poor white women.

430
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:27,576
所以啦 你永远不知道会发生什么嘛
So you never know.

431
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:30,513
谢谢 我现在感觉好多了
Thank you. I feel better now.

432
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:32,615
- 可我感觉不好啊!  - 很好
- I don't!  - Good.

433
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:35,418
Bernadette 我希望你生个女儿
Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.

434
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,580
唉 我也不知道这该怎么说
Um, I don't really know how to say this.

435
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,249
你可以从叫我"长官"开始说起
Well, you could try starting with "sir".

436
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:51,251
哦对 对不起 长官
Right. Sorry, sir.

437
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:53,920
他说从长官说起 不是以长官结尾
He said start with it, not end with it.

438
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:56,994
- 长官...  - 嗯?
- Sir... - Hmm?

439
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,694
我们现在碰了点小钉子
We've hit a bit of a snag.

440
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,630
我们已经落后进度了
We're already behind schedule.

441
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,799
解决军用问题所需要的
The computations required to overcome

442
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,201
计算量
the deployability issues

443
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,537
比我们想象的要大很多
are more significant than we thought.

444
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,572
我知道我们签了合同
I understand that we're under contract,

445
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,174
然后我也不是很清楚违反合同
and I don't know what the consequences

446
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:13,242
的后果是什么 但是...
of violating that are, but, uh...

447
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:15,745
我们在约定期限内
we're not gonna be able to deliver

448
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,313
是没法给出成果了
in the time we promised.

449
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:25,721
那你们需要多久呢?
How long do you need?

450
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,927
我们... 我们觉得... 两年
We... we're thinking... two years.

451
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:34,897
好吧
