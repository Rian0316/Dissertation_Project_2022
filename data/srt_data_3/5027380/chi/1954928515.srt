1
00:00:03,565 --> 00:00:05,899
- 嘿 去吃午饭吧  - 等等
- Hey, ready for lunch?  - Oh, one sec.

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:09,319
那是高重力离心机的传动系统雏形吗?
Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?

3
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:11,688
不是 Bernadette给我买了个Fitbit腕表 
No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,574
想要记录我到底做了多少运动
so she can track how much I'm exercising.

5
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:19,362
谁让她关心你的健康呢
That'll teach her to care about your health.

6
00:00:19,364 --> 00:00:22,949
我等不及要看我英年早逝时 她是什么表情了
I can't wait to see the look on her face when I die young.

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:25,585
你上次真正运动是什么时候?
When was the last actual exercise you got?

8
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:27,003
就前几天
The other day, when

9
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:30,257
她想让我戴上这东西 我逃跑了
she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,876
根据近期的一项研究
According to a recent study,

11
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:35,629
哪怕坐着不动 光是想着运动
simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still,

12
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:37,013
也能对身体有好处
can have physical benefits.

13
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,633
要知道 我可能现在就在运动中
For all you know, I could be exercising right now.

14
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:42,352
- 是吗?  - 还是明天再动好了
- Are you?  - Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.

15
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:44,638
我们多运动
It wouldn't be the worst thing

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,856
也不是什么坏事
if we were more active.

17
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:48,141
你说得很对
Oh. You make an excellent point.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,281
我都有点跑嗨了!
Ooh, I think I'm getting a runner's high!

19

* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,154
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

21
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:02,823
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

22
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:05,542
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *

看看大学开办的这些活动
Look at all these activities the university has.

32
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:28,947
攀岩俱乐部 箭术 夺旗橄榄球
Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.

33
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:32,333
我对旗帜有兴趣 对橄榄球没兴趣
Had me at flag, lost me at football.

34
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:34,953
好吧 我觉得你们想多运动是好事
Yeah, I think it's great you guys want to get more exercise,

35
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:37,872
但你们真觉得有适合你们的运动吗?
but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?

36
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:39,774
你是什么意思? 我们协调性太差
What are you saying? We're not coordinated enough

37
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:40,875
不能运动吗?
to play sports?

38
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:43,394
好吧 Leonard亲爱的
Okay, Leonard, sweetheart,

39
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:46,464
你玩拼字游戏都能扭伤脚踝
you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.

40
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:49,484
我用两分的Q拼出了
I got a triple-word score

41
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,219
三倍积分的词呢 如果这时候
with a double letter "Q." If that's not a time

42
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:53,888
都不能大跳拼字游戏舞 那这舞蹈还有什么用呢?
to bust out the Scrabble dance, what's the point of having one?

43
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:59,778
嘿 Barry Kripke开了个击剑俱乐部
Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.

44
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,782
有趣 击剑的确有某种优雅格调
Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal.

45
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:05,567
我想这个符合了我们
And I would imagine it meets many

46
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,236
对运动的大部分要求
of our personal criteria for a sport.

47
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,388
室内的 不用擦防晒霜
It's indoors, so no sunscreen.

48
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,207
不用丢 不用接
No throwing, no catching,

49
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,042
不用跑
no running.

50
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:16,828
不用穿会被拽下来的运动裤
No gym shorts that can be yanked down.

51
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,297
更惨的是被拽上去
Or worse, up.

52
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,132
说得对
Preach.

53
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,500
还有个额外的好处
And as an added bonus,

54
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:24,252
"一针见血"就是击剑运动里来的
the word "Touche" comes from fencing.

55
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:26,254
这是我们唯一以非隐喻性的方式
It would be our only opportunity to use it

56
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:28,973
来用到这个词
in a non-metaphorical sense.

57
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:31,142
那在法国学校玩抓人游戏的时候呢?
What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?

58
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:32,911
{\an8}touche是法国词

59
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:32,911
一针见血
Ah, touche.

60
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,065
谢谢你们过来
Thanks for coming by.

61
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,783
不客气 有什么事要我们帮忙?
Sure. So how can we help?

62
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,935
我知道现在比起以前
Well, I know more women are

63
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,821
买漫画的女人越来越多了 但出于某种原因
buying comics than ever, but for some reason,

64
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:44,606
她们... 就是不进我的店
I... I can't get 'em in here.

65
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,774
好吧 你都试过什么方法了?
All right, well, what have you tried so far?

66
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:50,278
我... 进了一些面向女性的漫画书
Uh, I've... I've been stocking more female-oriented titles.

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,448
我把厕所里卷纸的一头折成了
Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper

68
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,816
三角形
into a triangle.

69
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:56,167
还有
And, uh,

70
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:57,952
你们现在坐的地方
you are now sitting in the official

71
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:00,071
是哺乳区域
breastfeeding area.

72
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,627
- 不会吧? 这是漫画店诶  - 噢
- Really? In a comic book store?  - Oh,

73
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,795
别担心 我在这上面装了监控摄像头
don't worry. I... I've got a camera right up here,

74
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:10,465
我就能在柜台那儿看到了
so I could watch from the counter

75
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:13,751
确保没有男人在偷窥
and make sure guys aren't being pervs.

76
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:19,474
总之
Anyway,

77
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:21,392
我用什么方法
so what do I got to do to... to

78
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:22,527
能吸引你们进来?
get you in the door?

79
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:24,362
首先呢
Well, for starters,

80
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:26,648
你应该换掉某些装饰画
you might want to rethink some of this artwork.

81
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,069
我是说 这女人跟狗一样被绑着
I mean, this woman's actually on a leash like a dog.

82
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,821
你不知道这画背后的故事
Well, you don't know the backstory.

83
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:36,708
也许是因为她一直跳到沙发上呢
Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.

84
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:51,806
我觉得好酷
I feel cool.

85
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:55,343
就像穿靴子的猫
Like Puss in Boots.

86
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:56,565
我从小就一直想
I always wanted to be a

87
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,846
- 成为一名剑士  - 确切来说
- swashbuckler when I was a kid.  - Technically,

88
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,065
"Swashbuckler"这个词包含了两部分
"Swashbuckler" is a combination of two terms.

89
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,601
前半部分指的是挥剑的声音
"Swash" referring to the sound of the sword.

90
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:05,520
唰
Swash.

91
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:08,106
然后
And then

92
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:11,192
后半部分指的是小型盾牌 但你没有
"Buckler" meaning a small shield, which you don't have.

93
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:12,760
我们还是可以当"唰"士呀
We can still be swashers.

94
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:14,662
说得好 小猫
Well said, Puss.

95
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:20,468
先生们 欢迎来到击剑俱乐部
Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing club.

96
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,372
在我们开始前 我想要提醒各位 击剑不是闹着玩
Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn't a joke.

97
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:26,040
我希望你们来这里 不是因为觉得击剑会和
I hope you're not here because you think it's going to be

98
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,042
星战系列演的一样
like Star Wars.

99
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,093
我们不是为了这个来的
That's not why we're here.

100
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:30,295
没错 我来这里是因为
Yeah, I'm here because I think

101
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:31,963
觉得这会跟"权力游戏"演的一样
it's gonna be like Game of Thrones.

102
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:34,382
也许还有点像"公主新娘"演的那样
And maybe a little Princess Bride.

103
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:36,134
对了对了! 我忘了"公主新娘"!
Ooh, ooh! I forgot about Princess Bride!

104
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,686
我要把答案改成这个!
That's my answer!

105
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:42,974
抱歉让你们失望了 但是击剑是一项很严肃的运动
Well, sorry to disappoint you, but fencing is a serious sport.

106
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:43,975
如果你们不愿努力的话
If you're not willing to put in the effort,

107
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:46,110
最好现在就撤
you might as well just leave now.

108
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:48,229
- 我们不怵体力活动的  - 对
- We're not afraid of physical activity.  - Yeah.

109
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:50,732
我今天已经跑了29千米了
I already ran 18 miles today.

110
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,619
好吧 我们先学些基础的
All right. Let's begin with some fundamentals.

111
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:56,955
这是预备姿势
This is the en garde position.

112
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:59,874
双脚呈"L型" 两脚后跟在一条直线上
Feet are in an "L." Heels in a straight line.

113
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:00,825
肘关节离胸腔
Elbow is about a fist

114
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:02,493
一拳距离
from the rib cage.

115
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:05,463
注意我的主导腿面朝前方
Notice my dominant leg faces forward.

116
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:06,547
哦 不好了
Oh, dear.

117
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:07,915
怎么了 Cooper?
What's wrong, Cooper?

118
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:11,219
我不确定自己是否有主导腿
Well, I'm not sure I have a dominant leg.

119
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:12,971
它们俩都相当顺从呢
They're both pretty submissive.

120
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:16,975
你在公厕的时候
When you're in a public restroom,

121
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:19,193
通常用哪只脚冲水?
which foot do you flush the toilet with?

122
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,731
右脚 一直是右脚
Right. Always right.

123
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:24,983
他是个右撇子
He's a righty.

124
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:27,568
好的
Okay,

125
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,653
把预备姿势摆给我看
show me en garde.

126
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:30,989
好的 膝盖弯曲
Good. Knees bent,

127
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:32,657
略前于脚趾
slightly over the toe.

128
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:35,443
举起不拿剑的那只手保持平衡
Non-sword hand up for balance.

129
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:39,414
明天肯定会酸疼的
I am going to feel this tomorrow.

130
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,533
第一个步法叫前进
The first move is called an advance.

131
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:45,003
前脚向前 脚跟到脚趾
You move your front foot forward, heel to toe.

132
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,088
后脚跟上
Back foot follows.

133
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,424
前脚向前 脚跟到脚趾
So front foot forward, heel to toe.

134
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,125
后脚跟上
Back foot follows.

135
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,795
现在你们试试 前进
Now you try. Advance.

136
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:57,432
前进 前进
And advance. And advance.

137
00:05:57,434 --> 00:06:00,802
好简单 我根本不需要穿护杯嘛
This is easy. I didn't need to wear a cup.

138
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:01,803
好的
Good.

139
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:03,554
下一个动作叫后退
The next move is called a retreat.

140
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:04,639
往后走
Step back.

141
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,641
后脚先动 脚趾到脚跟
Back foot first, toe to heel.

142
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:08,309
前脚跟上
Front foot follows.

143
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,028
我数到三
On three.

144
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,279
- 等等 Barry?  - 啥事
- Excuse me, Barry?  - Yes.

145
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:13,448
我什么时候能刺他们仨?
When can I stab one of my friends?

146
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:16,534
在击剑中 我们不叫刺
In fencing, we don't call it a stab.

147
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:18,286
- 我们叫击  - 呃 是的 我知道
- We call it a touch.  - Uh, yes, I'm aware.

148
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:20,154
但如果我说我想"基"我朋友的话
But if I say I want to touch one of my friends,

149
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:23,074
我会被喊进人事部的
I'll get called into Human Resources.

150
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,625

什么?
What?

209
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:03,818
就是当我的荣誉受到了侮辱
You know, when my honor is insulted,

210
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,987
而想跟对方决斗的时候
and I need to challenge someone to a duel

211
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:09,707
就要用手套打对方的脸
by slapping them across the face with my glove.

212
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,125

226
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:42,490
你终于不再想Amy的事了
It's nice to see your mind off Amy.

227
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:43,991
Amy怎么了?
What's going on with Amy?

228
00:09:43,993 --> 00:09:45,559
虽然这不关你的事
Not that it's any of your business,

229
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,911
不过 她和我分手了
but she broke up with me.

230
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:48,446
真的?
Really?

231
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:50,031
很高兴知道这件事
Good to know.

232
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:54,201
"很高兴"?
"Good to know"?

233
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:56,037
- 他是什么意思?  - 哦
- What's that supposed to mean?  - Oh.

234
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,206
我也不想让你心烦 不过看起来他好像对Amy很感兴趣啊
I hate to say it, but it sounds like he's interested in her.

235
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,209
这简直不能忍
Well, that's unacceptable.

236
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:04,378
嘿 哥们 你知道你对这件事有意见
Oh, buddy, I get that you don't like it,

237
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,264
但是这也不是你能控制得了的
but it's not really up to you.

238
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,383
说得对 可是他也太蠢了 长得还丑
Yeah, but he's dumb, and his face is dumb.

239
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:12,687
就算不是他
Look, even if it's not him,

240
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:16,107
Amy也迟早会开始和别人约会的
Amy's probably going to date someone at some point.

241
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,792
你真这么觉得?
You really think so?

242
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:20,444
当然了 她有权利过得开心啊
Of course. She deserves to be happy.

243
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:23,064
你竟然这么想!
How dare you!

244
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:34,406
我觉得我应该给你个忠告
Listen, I should warn you

245
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:38,226
约Amy出去可能不太明智
that maybe asking Amy out isn't a good idea.

246
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:39,695
Barry 能跟你说句话吗?
Barry, a word?

247
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:42,080
你将听到的就是刚刚这话的暴走版
And now the crazy version of what I just said.

248
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,217
你要是想追Amy的话
If you intend to pursue Amy,

249
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,919
我就别无选择 只能想办法让你住手了
you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.

250
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:50,672
你想怎样?
And how are you gonna do that?

251
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,257
跟你决斗
By challenging you to a duel.

252
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,511
你只上过一次课 我会完爆你的
You've had one lesson. I'll destroy you.

253
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:58,680
所以 决斗会在从今天起三年后
That is why the duel will take place

254
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:01,516
的那天正午举行
at high noon, three years from today.

255
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,020
如果你能够担任击剑教练的话
If you're worth your salt as an instructor,

256
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,238
三年之后 我应该也差不多了
I should be ready by then.

257
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,357
还有 我警告你
Yeah, and be warned.

258
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,242
到时候 我会"基"遍你全身的
I'm going to touch you all over.

259
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:17,916
哇哦 这... 这比我想的还要暴走
Wow. That... that was crazier than I thought.

260
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:22,204
好吧 虽然可能不是真的
All right, I'm not saying

261
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:24,539
我们... 我们可以先假设
it's true, but let's... let's consider for a moment

262
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,958
- 有可能 是我自己身上出了问题  - 好啊
- that possibly I'm the problem.  - Yeah.

263
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,176
- 太对了  - 就是这么回事
- You are.  - You can say it.

264
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:29,795
好吧 好吧 那...?
Okay, fine. What...?

265
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:31,346
我能做什么啊?
I mean, what can I do?

266
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:33,131
在女人面前我就是会特别紧张
I get so nervous around women.

267
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,583
你正跟我们说话呢
Well, you're talking to us now.

268
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:36,168
看起来 你也没有很紧张啊
I mean, you don't seem nervous.

269
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,686
那是因为我说话的时候在假想
Well, that's because I'm doing that trick

270
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:40,122
听众都没穿衣服之类的
where you imagine the audience is naked.

271
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,726
对了 你们身材都不错呢
By the way, thumbs up, ladies.

272
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:48,480
你自己知道这听起来有多诡异吗?
Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?

273
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:50,315
我开玩笑的
It was a joke.

274
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,516
是吗?
Was it?

275
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:53,285
不是 我还是在这么想
No, I'm still doing it.

276
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:56,238
好吧
Okay.

277
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,206
我无意冒犯 但是...
Don't be offended, but...

278
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,592
你到底有什么毛病啊?
what went wrong with you?

279
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:05,130
我... 我想我只是觉得
I... I guess I assumed at this point in my life,

280
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:08,216
现在我应该已经恋爱或者结婚
I would be married or in a relationship,

281
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:09,701
或者有一只
or even have a pet

282
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,220
不会跑出去自杀的宠物也好啊
that didn't run away or kill itself.

283
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:15,223
真的有宠物会自杀?
That really happened?

284
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:17,476
我也不确定 不过我发誓
I mean, I can't say for sure, but I swear

285
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:19,344
我的兔子在冲到一辆车下面之前
that rabbit looked me right in the eye

286
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,463
绝对看了我一眼
before it hopped in front of that car.

287
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:23,432
好吧
Anyway,

288
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,600
我孤单一人的时间越长 就越绝望
the longer I'm alone, the more desperate I get.

289
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:30,989
Stuart 不管你相不相信 我能理解你的心情
Stuart, believe it or not, I understand.

290
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,574
在我认识Sheldon之前
You know, before I met Sheldon,

291
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:35,110
有很长时间我都生活在孤独中
I was alone for a really long time.

292
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:37,129
那时候的我
I was so desperate

293
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,498
太希望别人喜欢我了 当我认识她们的时候
for people to like me, when I met these guys,

294
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,567
我尽了最大的努力 来掩饰自己缺乏安全感的事实
it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.

295
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:47,873
我们其实都感觉到了
Okay, we're all feeling it.

296
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,958
好啦 我约你出去
Yes, I'll go out with you.

297
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,481
我好像突然理解那只兔子了
Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.

298
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:02,137
Sheldon 我真没想到你居然愿意来体育主题的酒吧
I'm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.

299
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:04,639
你看这水泡
Look at this blister.

300
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:07,142
不管喜不喜欢 我们已经是运动员了
Like it or not, we're athletes now.

301
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:10,395
而且 在我想不明白感情问题的时候
Besides, a bar is where I belong.

302
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:12,647
我就会来酒吧
I'm having female problems.

303
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:15,233
你要是感觉心情不太好 还想酗酒的话 我倒是知道为什么
If you're cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.

304
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:19,621
Sheldon 别再想着Amy和别人约会的事了
Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys,

305
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:22,124
还不如考虑考虑约别的女孩出去
maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.

306
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:24,276
别开玩笑了
That's ridiculous.

307
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:25,577
怎么了? 在遇到Amy之前
Why? You never thought

308
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:26,828
你不是也没想过恋爱吗
you'd end up in a relationship,

309
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,046
结果你遇到了Amy
and then you met Amy.

310
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,581
也许还有其他的另一半在等着你
Maybe there's someone else out there for you.

311
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,502
有道理 但是Penny和Bernadette都结婚了
True, but Penny's married, and so is Bernadette.

312
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:37,005
而你的女朋友长着红头发白皮肤
And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin,

313
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:40,058
这会勾起我的小丑恐惧症
which really rubs up against my clown phobia.

314
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:43,178
也许你可以把
Maybe you should consider women

315
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,479
你好朋友认真谈的对象
who aren't in serious relationships

316
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,181
排除在外?
with your closest friends?

317
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:49,434
有一个前列腺医生 但是我还在生她的气
There's that prostate doctor, but I'm still mad at her.

318
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:53,355
哎 那里有个女人
Oh, there's a woman.

319
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:54,739
我让她来当我女朋友
Oh, I'll make her my girlfriend.

320
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,526
等等
Whoa, whoa.

321
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:01,613
在酒吧里随便跑到陌生女人面前不会起作用的
Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn't work.

322
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,498
你忘记一件事了
You're forgetting something.

323
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,916
姑娘们都爱运动员
Ladies love jocks.

324
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:08,203
他刚喝了几口啤酒?
How many sips of that beer did he have?

325
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:09,955
- 三口  - 大事不妙
- Three.  - Oh, boy.

326
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:16,545
打扰一下 我现在处于分手恢复期
Excuse me. I'm recovering from a recent breakup,

327
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:20,348
和其他女人约会可能会让我好受一点
and I'm told asking out another woman might make me feel better.

328
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,469
所以就像小智对皮卡丘说的 "我选你了"
And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, "I choose you."

329
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:26,555
什么?
What?

330
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:28,555
这是宠物小精灵的梗
It's a Pokemon reference.

331
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:30,308
我听不懂这是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

332
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,360
好吧 至少咱们试过了
Well, we gave it a shot.

333
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:35,981
你怎么样?
How about you?

334
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:39,067
我结婚了 而且我是她的奶奶
I'm married, and I'm her grandmother.

335
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:41,953
你咋没早点遇到朕
Ah, what might have been.

336
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:45,874
还有你 替我向马戏团问好
And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.

337
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:45,874
{\an8}Barnum and Bailey美国一家马戏团公司

338
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,464
Stuart对她的的拒绝 接受的还挺好的
Stuart took that rejection like a pro.

339
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,200
因为他知道咪咪摄像头正对着他呢
Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.

340
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:00,005
我没有拒绝他人的经验
I don't have much practice turning men down.

341
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:01,473
太没意思了
It wasn't so much fun.

342
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:02,841
哦 你会习惯的
Oh, you get used to it.

343
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:05,176
有些人你要拒绝一次又一次
Some guys you have to turn down over and over.

344
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:07,812
有时候你最后还是嫁给他了
And sometimes we marry them anyway.

345
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,067
哈
Huh.

346
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,319
真是奇怪
Well, this is weird.

347
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:17,439
- 怎么了?  - Barry Kripke约我了
- What?  - Barry Kripke just asked me out.

348
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,740
哦
Oh.

349
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:21,159
看看你呀... 一天有两个男人向你示好!
Look at you... two guys in one day!

350
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:24,696
我就说把你的眉毛修修能带来桃花运吧!
I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows!

351
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,083
他怎么说的?
What did he say?

352
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:30,569
"嗨 你好吗? 我在想
"Hi, how are you? I was wondering

353
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:33,421
你愿不愿意有空和我一起喝点什么"
if you'd like to get a drink after work sometime."

354
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,090
那你准备怎么办?
Well, what are you gonna do?

355
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:37,008
我不知道
I don't know.

356
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,011
我本来想 我以后会和别人去约会的
I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people,

357
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,264
但是这一切来得太快了
but this is happening so fast.

358
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:43,932
有什么坏处吗?
What can it hurt?

359
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,934
我希望下一个和我约会的人
Well, I was hoping the next person I dated

360
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:47,852
不要那么像Sheldon
would be a little less like Sheldon.

361
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:49,471
你是说 不要是个科学家?
You mean, not a scientist?

362
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,473
我觉得她是说 不要是个怪胎
I think she means not a weirdo.

363
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:54,276
你对他有意思吗?
Are you attracted to him?

364
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:56,528
我不知道
I don't know.

365
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,281
好吧 那你想象一下他的裸体 会有什么反应?
All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?

366
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:00,432
哦 根本不需要想
Oh, I don't have to imagine it.

367
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,824
我闻起来怪怪的
I smell funny.

368
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:14,162
舔起来咸咸的
I taste salty.

369
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:17,132
你只是锻炼之后出汗了而已
You're just sweaty from exercise.

370
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:18,500
尝起来还挺好吃的
And kind of delicious.

371
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:23,972
不知道要舔几下才能舔到我的夹心呢
I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the center of me.

372
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:29,260
我知道只要医生的一根手指就可以
I know it only takes one doctor's finger.

373
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:33,765
哈喽
Hello.

374
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,433
哈喽
Hello.

375
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,018
应该让你们单独聊聊
We should let you guys talk.

376
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,986
说得对
Yeah.

377
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:39,237
你不需要走开的
You don't have to leave.

378
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:40,989
你来追我呀!
Look at me go!

379
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:44,492
呃 Bernadette你说好开车带我的
Uh, Bernadette, you're my ride.

380
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:45,527
走回去!
Walk!

381
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,367
你怎么样了?
How have you been?

382
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:54,285
我挺好的
I'm doing all right.

383
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:56,671
我今天去练习击剑了
I tried fencing today.

384
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:58,423
练的怎么样了?
How'd that go?

385
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,092
挺简单的
It was pretty easy.

386
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:03,511
我想是我"运算员"的背景给了很大的帮助
And I think my background in "Mathletics" helped.

387
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,599
Barry Kripke也在那
Barry Kripke was there.

388
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:08,933
我要告诉你
I should let you know

389
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:11,686
他有兴趣约你
that he expressed interest in asking you out.

390
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:14,723
实际上 他... 已经约了
Well, actually, he... he already did.

391
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,775
好吧
Okay.

392
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:18,476
但是别喜欢上他
But don't get too attached to him.

393
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:21,446
因为两年又364天之后 他就死了
In two years, 364 days, he's a dead man.

394
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:26,234
我拒绝了
I said no.

395
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,902
有意思
Interesting.

396
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:32,073
我今天约了两个女人出门 她们也都拒绝了我
I asked two women out today, and they both said no.

397
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:35,543
想不到你对约会有兴趣
I didn't know you were interested in dating.

398
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:38,663
有人告诉我这是重新开始的好办法
I've been told it's a good way to move on.

399
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,999
哦
Oh.

400
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,751
好吧
Okay.

401
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:49,057
不管怎样 呃 很高兴能看到你
Anyway, um, it's nice to see you.

402
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,642
你看起来挺好的
You look good.

403
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:51,643
嗯 谢谢
Mmm, thanks.

404
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:52,927
我尝起来也挺好的
And I taste good too.

405
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,313
Howie啊?
Howie?

406
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:09,382
怎么了?
What's up?

407
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:14,213
为什么你的Fitbit上显示你昨天跑了280千米?
Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
