1
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:03,198
Oleg 二号桌的客人问
Oleg, the people at Table Two

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,799
蔬菜汉堡里都放了些什么
want to know what's in the veggie burger.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,566
他们不会想知道的
No. They don't.

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,340
呃 没关系
Eh. That's fine.

5
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:13,857
他们想要续杯 所以我大概
They wanted refills, so I'm probably not

6
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:15,443
不会再去那桌了
gonna go back there anyway.

7
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:16,845
Max呢?
Where's Max?

8
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:18,313
这盘菜已经放了很久了
This plate has been here so long,

9
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:21,990
三文鱼都要变沙门菌了
the salmon is turning into Salmonella.

10
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:25,981
她和新的洗碗工去休息了
She took a break with the new dishwasher.

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,123
Max 我以为你从后门溜出去了
Max, I thought you slipped out the back.

12
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:31,884
他的确溜出了我的后门 但我把他塞回去了
He did for a minute, but I popped him back in.

13
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:39,834
我得说 和同事上床之后
This just in, work is so much more fun

14
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:42,603
工作就变得有趣多了
when you're sleeping with a co-worker.

15
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:44,438
Max 刚才太爽了
Max, that was good.

16
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,241
和连诵五遍圣母经一样爽
It was five Hail Marys good.

17
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:51,512
我觉得我们把盘子弄得更脏了
I think we made these dishes dirtier.

18
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:56,650
Max 他的确可爱 但对着那口音 你怎么硬得起来?
Max, he's cute, but how can you even stay hard with that accent?

19
00:00:56,651 --> 00:01:01,487
"过来 Max 我要和你嘿咻一把"
"Come here, Max. I wanna hump ya a wee bit".

20
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:05,259
只能说 我一向很喜欢
What can I say, I always had a thing

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,829
幸运符麦片盒子上的男孩子
for the guy on the box of Lucky Charms.

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,229

26
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,231
大家好
Hey, everybody.

27
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:33,371
瞧 我买了个运动腕带
Look, I got me a Fitbit.

28
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:37,642
十三 十四 十五...
13, 14, 15...

29
00:01:37,643 --> 00:01:41,045
再走二十万步 我就能在婚礼上
Only 200,000 more steps before I get a bit more fit

30
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:43,081
显得苗条一点
for my wedding.

31
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:44,515
真厉害
That's impressive.

32
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:48,069
我连十二步都走不了
I couldn't even make it through 12 steps.

33
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:50,655
嘿 Max
Hey, Max.

34
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:52,824
我的伴娘今天好吗?
How's my maid of honor?

35
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:54,225
嘿 Caroline
Hey, Caroline.

36
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:59,230
我毫不出众的婚礼嘉宾今天好吗?
How's my run-of-the-mill wedding guest?

37
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:02,033
我很好 你信吗?
I'm doing great. Did that sound convincing?

38
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,803
因为我每天早上都要在浴室镜子前
'Cause I've been practicing it in the bathroom mirror

39
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:05,670
练习这句话一个小时
for an hour every morning.

40
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,405
我知道 因为你一练习
I know, I've got to stop sitting on the toilet

41
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,840
我就得从马桶上起来
while you do that.

42
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:12,810
Max 我们商量下伴娘裙的事
Max, let's talk bridesmaid dresses.

43
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,612
我无所谓 穿什么都可以
I don't care, I'll wear anything.

44
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:18,115
我穿了件灰狗长途车司机的制服去参加的毕业舞会
I wore a Greyhound Bus driver's uniform to my prom.

45
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,952
因为我是下班直接过去的
I was coming straight from work.

46
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:23,754
我决定穿
Well, I have decided to wear

47
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:26,323
祖母的结婚礼服
Grandma Kuchenski's wedding gown.

48
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:29,593
我家所有女人都穿那件出嫁的
Yeah, all of the women in my family wore it.

49
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:31,762
除了Svetti和Letti阿姨
Everyone except aunts Svetti and Letti,

50
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:36,534
因为她们是连体儿
'cause, well, they're attached at the abdomen.

51
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:37,801
你来了
There she is.

52
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:42,276
让我男式火腿更添味道的宝贝
The hot sauce for my Huevos Mancheros.

53
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:48,512
嘿 Sophie宝贝 我弄到你想要的东西了
Hey, Sophie, baby, I got you what you want.

54
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:52,181
Oleg 没人想要肝炎病菌
Oleg, no one wants Hepatitis.

55
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:54,952
定下了
It's official.

56
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:57,721
我们的婚礼会被登上纽约时报
Our wedding's gonna be in The Times.

57
00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:00,524
Oleg 你怎么可能上纽约时报?
Oleg, how are you gonna be in The Times?

58
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:01,959
纽约时报很挑剔的
The Times tends to be picky

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,995
而且你只喜欢挖鼻孔
and you tend to be more "picky your nose."

60
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:09,500
要知道 我的第二次婚礼就上了纽约时报
You know, my second wedding made The Times.

61
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:14,705
因为我的第一任妻子朝我的腿开了一枪
'Cause my first wife showed up and shot me in the leg.

62
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:18,976
是我妹妹Vlanka发来的
That's Vlanka, my sister.

63
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:21,345
她是另一个伴娘
She's my other bridesmaid.

64
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:25,182
我们的确关系不亲密 但我很同情她
Yeah, we're not that close, but I feel bad for her

65
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:28,517
因为她长大了 脸上还是有雀斑
'cause she's one of those adults with freckles.

66
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:34,191
Max 你要上纽约时报了!
Max, you're going to be in The Times!

67
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:38,094
但得穿Sophie挑的衣服上纽约时报
In The Times, wearing God knows what Sophie will pick.

68
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:43,065
我是说 她有一抽屉健身时候戴的钻石冠冕
I mean, she has a drawer full of diamond tiaras for the gym.

69
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,470
嘿 你们俩在聊什么?
Hello, what are you two talking about?

70
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:50,774
决定忽略哪几桌的客人吗?
Deciding which tables to ignore?

71
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,208
我们在说Sophie的品味
We're talking about Sophie's taste.

72
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,080
两位毒舌婊 拜托
Oh, bitch, please. Come on.

73
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:02,719
我的早餐纤维曲奇都好过Sophie
My morning fiber cookie has better taste than Sophie.

74
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,055
姑娘们 Vlanka下岗了
Girls, Vlanka's out.

75
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,824
她在闹情绪 脸上还有雀斑
She has an attitude and freckles.

76
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:11,494
我知道 这些八竿子打不着
Yeah. I mean, that's too far.

77
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:15,398
所以 恭喜Caroline!
So, Caroline, congratulations!

78
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:18,500
你是我的新伴娘!
You're my new bridesmaid!

79
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,310
好了 我找到条喜欢的伴娘裙
Okay, I found a bridesmaid's dress that I like.

80
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,911
但要想买得起 我只能把你卖给
But the only way we can afford it is if I sell you

81
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:32,181
分类广告网上的那个亚美尼亚人
to that Armenian guy on Craigslist.

82
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:33,349
没门
No way.

83
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,685
我最多只能吃四口鹰嘴豆泥
I get sick of hummus after four bites.

84
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:38,287
Max 我们得掌控局面
Max, we have to take charge of this.

85
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:40,056
因为无论Sophie挑怎样的伴娘裙
Because whatever bridesmaid's dress Sophie picks

86
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:41,858
都会像泰勒·派瑞演的电影里的
is like a Tyler Perry movie.

87
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:41,858
{\an8}泰勒·派瑞: 美国演员 导演 编剧

88
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:45,560
我不用看都知道肯定很糟糕
I don't have to see it to know it's gonna be awful.

89
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,433
我们得找些经典漂亮的裙子
We'll find something classy, and beautiful,

90
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,601
然后直接塞给她
and just shove it down her throat.

91
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:55,996
是谁要给谁塞什么呀?
Who's shoving what down whom?

92
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,335
如果你们没经历 我有哦
And if you don't have a story, I do.

93
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:05,147
John 我和Max被绑去当伴娘了
John, Max and I got roped into being bridesmaids.

94
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:06,415
别说了
Stop.

95
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,683
捆绑我喜欢
You had me at rope.

96
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:10,619
但我不喜欢伴娘
You lost me at bridesmaids.

97
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,321
我去前台站着看礼服了
I'll be at the hostess stand, looking at dresses

98
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:14,256
然后默默希望有颗小行星
and silently wishing for an asteroid

99
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:16,088
能把我们从地球上抹去
to wipe us off the planet.

100
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:18,624
如果希望都能成真 那我们现在
If wishes made things happen, we'd been in the middle

101
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,062
就会被一群僵尸围着了
of a zombie apocalypse right now.

102
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:24,166
姑娘们好
Hey, girls.

103
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,801
我的礼服从波兰送过来了
My dress just arrived from Poland

104
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:28,037
我很想让你们看看
and I'm bustin' for you to see it.

105
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:31,952
你们慢慢看 我在一边吃个十四刀的布丁
See it while I eat one of your $14 puddings.

106
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,510
Sophie 我考虑了一下伴娘服的颜色
Sophie, I've been looking at color choices,

107
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,413
你觉得我们穿裸色的伴娘裙如何?
and how would you feel about us in a nude?

108
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:43,185
Max裸着还行 可是你没什么好裸的啊
Max could go nude but you don't have the rack to pull it off.

109
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,252
有人有刀吗?
Does anyone have a knife?

110
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,759
Max 你在甜品站工作
Max, why do you have a switchblade

111
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,527
带着把弹簧刀干什么?
to work in a dessert bar?

112
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:55,428
我妈一直教育我说要做好保护措施
My mother always told me to carry protection.

113
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,736
等着看Kuchenski祖母的婚纱吧
Wait till you see Grandma Kuchenski's dress.

114
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,871
虽然做工也许大不如前了
They don't make them like they used to.

115
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:06,760
你懂的 现在强迫吉普赛劳工干活是违法的
You know, forced gypsy labor is illegal now.

116
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,514
好了 瞧
Here we go.

117
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:14,216
- 呕  - 额...
- Oh.  - Uh...

118
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:18,619
Sophie 你祖母是看守地窖的吗?
Sophie, was your grandma the Crypt Keeper?

119
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,191
这里什么发生了什么?
What's going on out here?

120
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:25,527
空中飘着这么多白色粉末是什么情况?
What's all that white powder in the air?

121
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:29,264
我开的是餐厅 不是80年代的迪厅
I'm trying to run a restaurant, not an 80's disco.

122
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,866
哦 闭上你的嘴吧
Oh, put a sock in it.

123
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:35,235
我可是消费了你那迷之昂贵的糕点的
I'm buying one of your freaking overpriced puddings.

124
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:42,343
我本该生气 但我现在有点儿喜欢你了
I'd get mad but I'm mildly attracted to you right now.

125
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:45,814
才一点点?
Just mildly?

126
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:49,684
老娘这下生气了
I mean, now I'm getting mad.

127
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:51,186
对不起 都是婚礼惹的祸
Sorry. Wedding drama.

128
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:53,087
她的婚纱刚刚碎成一片片的...
Her dress just fell completely to pieces...

129
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:56,624
就像我预想着未来的自己也支离破碎
like I'm assuming I'll do in the near future.

130
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,126
任何跟婚礼有关的东西
Whatever you need bridal,

131
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,128
都能在布鲁克林的那家婚
go to Rosenfeld's in Brooklyn.

132
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,732
在我破产又喜欢男人的时候就在那里买的婚纱
That's where I got my dress when I was broke and straight.

133
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,701
所以说你不是一直喜欢女人的吗?
So you weren't always into women?

134
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:08,503
我当然一直喜欢的女人
Of course I was.

135
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:12,635
除了在我信奉科学教的那三年
Except those three years in Scientology.

136
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:16,811
好吧 看来我们三个
Well, it looks like the three of us

137
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,247
要一起去淘点伴娘裙了
are going to go dress shopping now.

138
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:22,016
哦 我必须要先去洗个手
Yeah. And you know, I got to go wash my hands

139
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:25,552
它们上面沾满了老女人的死皮
'cause they're covered in old lady DNA.

140
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:31,025
好吧 就这样咯
Well, that's that.

141
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,660
和Sophie一起购物 就像是我之前
Shopping with Sophie is like when I worked

142
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,962
在泰式按摩店工作那样
in a Thai massage parlor.

143
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:37,897
我们要完蛋了
We are going down.

144
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:43,938
除非我们比Sophie先去那家店
Not if we go before Sophie

145
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,274
把所有她会看上的难看伴娘裙都藏起来
and hide every ugly bridesmaid's dress that Sophie would like.

146
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:50,344
只要别让她看到 她就不会让咱们穿了
If she can't see them, she can't make us wear them.

147
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,946
你脑子怎么转得这么快?
How did you come up with that so fast?

148
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:54,014
当我2010年为切尔西·克林顿(前总统克林顿女儿)
It's the same plan I used in 2010

149
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,550
当伴娘的时候用的也是这招
when I was a bridesmaid for Chelsea Clinton.

150
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:59,919
难看的伴娘裙 然后她爸还尾随我进了更衣室
Bad dress and then her father followed me into the coat room.

151
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:05,392
哦 哇哦
Oh, wow.

152
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:06,460
瞧瞧这里
Look at this place.

153
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:08,128
它让我想起了一部电影
It reminds me of that movie.

154
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,499
- 是"伴娘"吗?  - 不是 是"猛鬼街"
- Bridesmaids?  - No, Nightmare on Elm Street.

155
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,668
Caroline我实在不知道你有什么可担心的
I don't know what you're worried about, Caroline.

156
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,537
我觉得这些婚纱挺漂亮的
I think they're all quite lovely.

157
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,738
Nash 拜托
Nash, please.

158
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:21,642
你就是一爱尔兰穷小子
You're a poor person from Ireland.

159
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:23,710
等我想要申请免费的腿支架时
I'll ask your opinion when I need to know where to go

160
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,252
我会向你咨询
to get free leg braces.

161
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,216
你是对的 Max
You were right, Max.

162
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,586
她有时候确实挺贱的
She can be a real "B" sometimes.

163
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:35,122
抱歉 但我真不知道他为啥也跟着来
I'm sorry, but I don't even know why he's here.

164
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:38,442
这位山寨版的奥伯里恩
Bonin' O'Brien here...

165
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,596
能够帮我们拖住那些女销售
is gonna distract the sales lady

166
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:45,632
好让我们去把难看的伴娘裙藏起来
while we hide the ugly dresses.

167
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,300
你们好 女士们
Hello, ladies.

168
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:50,303
计划不变
Same plan.

169
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,905
哪位是幸运的新娘?
Who's the lucky bride?

170
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,743
或许我该说 哪位有幸地吃到小鲜肉了?
Or should I say, who's the lucky cradle robber?

171
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,078
别管我
Don't mind me.

172
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,779
我的幽默感太澎湃了
It's just my crazy sense of humor.

173
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,748
这里的女士们都爱死我的幽默感
Oh, the ladies here love it.

174
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,683
她们管我叫"狂野Carl"
The call me "Crazy Carl."

175
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:07,554
"你刚听到狂野Carl说什么了吗?"
"Did you hear what Crazy Carl said?"

176
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:10,023
她们就是爱死我了
They just love it.

177
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:11,391
我是Caroline
I'm Caroline.

178
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:13,660
这是Max 而他不是新郎
This is Max and he isn't the groom.

179
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:14,894
没错
No, no, no.

180
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:17,731
他是一个单身同性恋
He's single and gay. Yes.

181
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:21,199
太弯了 以至于他被单向组合乐队给踢了出来
So gay, he got kicked out of One Direction.

182
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:27,540
你们俩何不出去走走
Why don't you two walk off somewhere

183
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,443
聊聊辛酸的出柜史呢
and share poignant coming-out stories.

184
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,278
快去
Go.

185
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,615
- 但是Max...  - 哦 听话 快去吧
- But Max...  - Oh, you heard the women, go.

186
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,983
倒也可以
Can do.

187
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:39,519
女士们 你们随便看看 我们...
Ladies, look around, we'll be back...

188
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,487
一个月后回来
in about a month.

189
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:43,122
有人想去大溪地度假吗
Tahiti anyone?

190
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:44,524
我就是如此疯狂的Carl
I'm just Crazy Carl.

191
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,224
女士们爱死我了
The ladies love it.

192
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,996
好的伴娘服就该有伴娘服的样子
Bridesmaid's dresses should be called what they are.

193
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:53,733
捐给慈善机构的昂贵捐赠啊
Really expensive donations to Goodwill.

194
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:55,067
这件丑吗?
Is this one bad?

195
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:57,503
开玩笑 这件可是国际名牌
No. That's a Vera Wang.

196
00:09:57,504 --> 00:10:01,073
但是这件 绝对不行
But this is a very wrong.

197
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:03,242
藏起来
Hide it.

198
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:06,764
咦 还有一个一样丑的姐妹装
Ew. And it's evil twin.

199
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:11,749
哦 居然还有带着羽毛的救生衣
Oh, I didn't know Hazmat suits came with feathers.

200
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:16,322
天啊
Oh my God.

201
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,358
这是我见过的最可怕的东西了
This the worst thing I've ever seen.

202
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,527
我甚至见过一个妓女在人行道上
And I've seen a prostitute change her tampon

203
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:23,996
换卫生棉
on the sidewalk.

204
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:27,899
你叫谁妓女呢?
Who are you calling a prostitute?

205
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:34,773
快 我们一定得把这件藏起来
This, we've got to hide.

206
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:36,442
我脱不下来
I can't get this dress off.

207
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:37,843
只要跟她说 你在谷歌工作
Just tell it you work at Google

208
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:39,979
而且你想定居下来 就会有人帮你脱衣服了
and you're thinking of settling down.

209
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,281
抬起来 抬起来啊 把她丢进去
Lift it up. Lift it up. Dump it back there.

210
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:44,016
住手!
Stop!

211
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:47,820
把可爱的黄油贝蒂放下来
You put Butterscotch Betty down.

212
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,589
哦 我们只是在找价格标签
Oh, we were just looking for a price tag.

213
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,725
我知道你们在干什么
I know what's going on here.

214

你们想把漂亮衣服藏起来
You're hiding the good dresses

215
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:55,828
让别人找不到 好等到我们明天
to make sure no one else can get them

216
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,363
年度半价活动之时来抢购
at our annual half-off sale tomorrow.

217
00:10:58,364 --> 00:10:59,898
没错 我们就是这么打算的
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

218
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,334
我们要把漂亮衣服藏起来
We're hiding the good dresses.

219
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:05,971
其实 我刚还抓到另一个人也是这样
In fact, I just caught another Sneaky Sue.

220
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:09,608
哦 就是我 Sophie

哦 看看这个颜色
Oh, look at the color.

223
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:22,587
那不是颜色 那是辐射
That's not color. That's radiation.

224
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:25,056
这件裙子是独一无二的
That dress is a one of a kind.

225
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:26,158
就是说 只有一件?
Meaning there's only one?

226
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,126
不 我们有两件
No, we have two.

227
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,195
我正好有两个伴娘!
And I have two bridesmaids!

00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:35,666
生活如此完美 我真是太开心了
I love it when life works out perfect like this.

229
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,393
看看这个地方吧
Look at this place.

230
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:51,927
这么多绝望的女人挤在这
There are more desperate women crammed in here

231
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:55,931
比肯尼·切斯尼演唱会飞溅区的人还要多
than the splash zone at a Kenny Chesney concert.

232
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,768
没错 就跟沃尔玛的黑色星期五一样
I know. It's like Black Friday at Walmart

233
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:02,772
我宁肯在踩踏事件中丧生
And like Black Friday, hopefully someone will trample me.

234
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:06,609
多亏了那些裙子 我的人生就这么完蛋了
Cause thanks to these dresses, my life is over.

235
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,077
Max 你在听我说话吗?
Max, did you hear me?

236
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:09,912
我的人生完蛋了
My life is over.

237
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:11,580
那次中国餐厅忘了给你鸭酱
You said that when the Chinese food place

238
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,449
你就是这么说的
forgot the duck sauce.

239
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,485
好吧 对不起 我只是想以一个全新的形象
Well, I'm sorry, but I had a whole other scenario planned

240
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,254

242
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,925
可现在 我只能像小丑一样
Now, I'm just going to be in The Times,

243
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:25,928
出现在杂志里
looking like a stupid ash.

244
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,363
往前挤啊 大姐 给点力啊
Shoot, girl, just push on through.

往前走啊 大姐
Just go, girl.

250
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,143
我可不想别人把那两件
I don't want anybody else to get those

251
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:38,790
黄色裙子抢走
two yellow dresses.

252
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,010
Max 你听见了吗?
Max, did you hear that?

253
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,844
有人比Sophie的品味还差
Someone has worst taste than Sophie.

254
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,517
我们躲到她们后面去
Now we just have to hang back here

255
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,152
让她们先把裙子买了
and let them get to those dresses first.

256
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,487
耶! 我的人生又重见天日了
Yay! My life is good again.

257

00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,995
什么 只让我开心一秒吗?
What was that, like, a second?

259
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,030
我给你们占位子了
I saved you a space upfront.

260
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,466
快过来
Come on.

261
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:05,634
好吧 看来没希望了
Well, it's over.

262
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,302
一旦他们剪下缎带 开始营业
As soon as they cut that ribbon,

263
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:09,304
Sophie就要把任何挡在我们和
Sophie's going to Marshawn Lynch everyone who

264
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,540
黄色裙子中间的人给撂倒了
gets in the way of us and those dresses.

265
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,707
只有一个办法
There's only one way out of this.

266
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,209
就是你刚才提到的
And you called it earlier.

267
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,379
你得制造一起踩踏事件
You have to let them trample you.

268
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,680
我是认真的
I'm serious.

269
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:21,549
我才不要故意摔倒被人踩呢
I'm not about to be trampled on purpose.

270
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,051
如果听见下面这些话
See if you still feel that way

271
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,020
你会做何感想
after I say these next few words:

272
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,722
"图中左一 Caroline Channing"
"Pictured from left, Caroline Channing."

273
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:32,293
把那些试图往我眼睛上踩的高跟鞋推开
Try to fend off any heels you see heading for my eyes.

274
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:33,795
注意了 女士们

如你们所见 我手上有一把大剪刀
As you see, I have the big scissors,

276
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:39,167
也就意味着 是时候...
which can only mean it's time...

277
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:40,568

That Carl is crazy.

哦!
Oh!

284
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:05,927
虽然我是蹒跚着走完过道的
Well, I may be limping down the aisle,

285
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,696
但至少我不是在速易洁清洁公司卖的
but at least I won't be limping in something Swiffer might sell

286
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:10,998
吊扇除尘器下走过
to dust off ceiling fans.

287
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,603
天啊! 她来了!
Oh, my God, girl! here she comes!

288
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,124
她来了
Here she comes.

291
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,212
从我冰冷的死亡之手里把它撬出来
pry it out of my cold, dead hands.

292
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:26,581
嘿 Max Caroline!
Hey, Max, Caroline!

293
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:31,786

Try it on! Try it on!

294
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,821
请跟我来更衣室
Follow me to the changing room.

295
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:53,047
我不要穿着这条裙子出去 我害怕
I'm never coming out in this dress, I'm scared.

296
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:56,516
我数 一 二...
So on the count of one, two...

297
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:02,589
也许没那么糟
Maybe it's not that bad.

298
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:09,847
很糟
It's bad.

299
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,300
好吧 告诉我
Okay. So you're telling me,

300
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:14,268
范哲思被杀了
Versace got murdered,

301
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:14,268
{\an8}范哲思，1978年创立Versace奢侈品牌，1998年被黑社会谋杀

302
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,438
却没有人把设计这衣服的人杀了?
but no one's taken out whoever made these?

303
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,240
我懂
I know.

304
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,108
我感觉翠迪鸟要起诉我们
I feel like Tweety Bird is gonna sue us

305
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,108
{\an8}黄色小鸟的卡通形象，由华纳出品

306
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:24,812
侵权了啊
for copyright infringement.

307
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:29,884
我感觉我们应该在下面放巨型的厕所卷纸
I feel like we should have giant toilet paper rolls under here.

308
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,285
也许没有这强光之后
Well, maybe we'll like these better

309
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,453
我们会更喜欢这衣服
when we're out of this bright light.

310
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:36,157
Max 这强光就是我们自己
Max, we are the bright light.

311
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:39,398
女士们 你们把配套的帽子给忘了
Ladies, you forgot the matching hats.

312
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:44,098
还有吗?
There's more?

313
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:48,169
对了 要是有人发现一片赞安诺 那是我的
Oh, if anyone finds a Xanax, it's mine.

314
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:48,169
{\an8}赞安诺一般用于治疗焦虑和失眠

315
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,771
两个女人争夺一条印花鱼尾裙时
It was knocked out of my hand by two women duking it out

316
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:55,142
药片在我手里被撞掉了
over a chintz mermaid dress.

317
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:56,876
哦 现在好看了
Oh, now it looks good.

318
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:06,487
赞安诺在外逍遥 我却站在这里?
There's Xanax on the loose and I'm just standing here?

319
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:10,657
除了我磕高了 我才有理由穿这种衣服
At least if I was high, I'd have an excuse to be wearing this.

320
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:12,126
药啊 药啊 到这儿来
Here pilly, pilly.

321
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:15,012
药啊 药啊 到这儿来
Here pilly, pilly, pilly.

322
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:19,399
妹子 说真的 你们穿上这裙子
Girl, for real, you look like straight up crap

323
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,435
真是烂透了
in that dress.

324
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:22,936
真的
For real.

325
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,908
你们白人女孩撑不起这种颜色
You white girls can't pull that color off.

326
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:27,140
真是浪费了耀眼的柠檬黄
That's a waste of poppin' lemon yellow.

327
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,275
我知道
I know.

328
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:31,345
我太白了 不能穿这个
I am way too white for this.

329
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:34,309
她也因为太白了而无法一直学黑人说"畅饮"
She's also too white to say "turnt up" all the time,

330
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,650
但她还是会说
but that hasn't stopped her.

331
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:39,219
这条裙子不是我选的
This dress was not my choice.

332
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,554
我一点也不喜欢它
I hate everything about it.

333
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:41,621
这就是个灾难
This is a disaster.

334
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:43,557
这就是"末日裙子"
This is "Dressageddon."

335
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:46,493
对 但这是褒义
Yeah, but in a good way.

336
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:49,663
你们俩不想穿这条裙子
You two don't want to wear the dresses.

337
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:51,598
你们不一定要穿
You don't have to.

338
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,433
可我以为你想要我们
But I thought you wanted us to match

339
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,936
跟气球和鸭子搭配
the balloons and the ducks.

340
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:59,973
Max 她说我们不必穿这裙子
Max, she said we don't have to wear the dress.

341
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,208
别质疑她!
Don't question her!

342
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,642
就像在监狱的守卫说你可以走了时
That's like questioning a prison guard

343
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:06,513
你却在质疑他一样
when he says you're free to go.

344
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:08,214
Sophie 你确定你不介意吗?
Sophie, are you sure you don't care?

345
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:11,551
是啊 当然
Oh, yeah. Sure.

346
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:14,653
裙子是你们的了 命运的宠儿
Yeah, they're all yours, Destiny's Child.

347
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:28,968
这丑陋的垃圾货有十磅重
This is ten pounds of ugly junk.

348
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:32,238
让我想起我曾经约会过的酒保Pete
Reminds me of this bartender, Pete, I used to date.

349
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:36,175
仔细想想 那也把我噎住了
Come to think of it, that made me gag, too.

350
00:17:36,176 --> 00:17:37,710
好了 搞定
Okay. Done.

351
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,384
你听 女更衣室里有哭声?
Listen, crying in a women's dressing room?

352
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:47,987
不管你是谁 姑娘 知心大妈来了
Whoever it is, girl, big butts are in.

353
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,959
那是Sophie的哭声
That's Sophie's cry.

354
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,090
我知道 是因为她在看"下一站歌后"时
I know, 'cause I hear it through the vent

355
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:57,599
我从通风口听到过
when she watches Nashville.

356
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:01,234
Sophie 是你吗?
Sophie?

357
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:04,136
不是
No.

358
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:06,906
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

359
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:11,544
不是我 但我没事
It's not me, but I'm okay.

360
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:17,616
Sophie 你为什么哭?
Sophie, why are you crying?

361
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:21,487
我听到你们对那裙子的评论时...
When I heard what you said about the dresses...

362
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:24,223
只是...
It's just...

363
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:27,193
就是 有点像是
It's almost, kind of like,

364
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:30,663
你们觉得我品味很差之类的
you think I have bad taste or something.

365
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:33,166
不
No.

366
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:39,805
Caroline觉得你品味很棒
Caroline thinks you have great taste.

367
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:43,108
是吗?
She does?

368
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,445
那她就应该这样说啊
Well, then she should say so.

369
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:50,014
马上
Now.

370
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:56,388
Sophie 我觉得你有自己独特的风格
Well, Sophie, I think you have your own unique style.

371
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:59,358
我觉得...
And I think...

372
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,496
我没有听见"很好"或者"品味"这些词
that I didn't hear the words "great" or "taste."

373
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,498
Sophie 你介意我的想法干嘛?
Sophie, what do you even care what I think?

374
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:07,766
你就直说吧!
Just say it!

375
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:12,603
Sophie 我觉得你品味很好
Sophie, I think you have great taste.

376
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,074
真的吗?
You do?

377
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:24,649
那我们还坐在这儿干嘛?
Then, what are we doing sitting here?

378
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,519
我们去把裙子拿回来!
Let's go and get those dresses back!

379
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,787
快 帮我!
Come on. Help me!

380
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,128
裙子已经被别的姑娘拿走了
Those other girls already took them.

381
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,096
什么?
What?

382
00:19:44,202 --> 00:19:46,137
至少我们不用再婚礼上穿着
Well, at least we don't have to wear those ugly,

383
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:48,540
那些难看的黄色伴娘裙了
yellow bridesmaid dresses at the wedding.

384
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,141
是啊 现在 你只需要
Yup. Now, you only have to wear

385
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:53,411
每晚在这里穿难看的黄色裙子
ugly, yellow dresses here, every night.

386
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:55,213
自从我意识到我手臂上的怪痣
This is the best thing that's happened to me

387
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:57,782
是葡萄果仁麦片 而不是癌症
since I realized that weird mole on my arm was just a Grape-Nut

388
00:19:57,783 --> 00:20:00,151
这是我遇到最好的事了
and not cancer.

389
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:01,486
姑娘们 好消息
Girls, great news.

390
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,054
你们把Han塞进了微波炉
You stuffed Han in the microwave

391
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:04,956
现在准备插电了吗?
and you're ready to hit power?

392
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,524
拜托 我们试过了
Come on. We've tried.

393
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,860
你知道他进不去的
You know he doesn't fit.

394
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:10,528
这是唯一让他显得体积太大的东西
The one thing he's too big for.

395
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:14,632
不 我请了Ilia Jorbich来当我们的婚礼摄影师
No, I got Ilia Jorbich to be our wedding photographer.

396
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:17,568
他是华沙时报最好的摄影师
He's the best photographer at The Warsaw Times.

397
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:21,105
也是唯一还有两条手臂的人
Well, he's the only one who still has both arms.

398
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:24,409
等等 是华沙时报吗?
Wait, it's the Warsaw Times?

399
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,510
这么久以来 我一直以为是
All this time, I've been thinking

400
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:27,779
纽约时报
it was The New York Times.

401
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,180
纽约时报?
New York Times?

402
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:30,581
我这个更加独家好吗
This is much more exclusive.

403
00:20:30,582 --> 00:20:32,416
你只能在两个地方找到它
You can only get it in two places.

404
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:36,221
波兰以及新泽西州卖导弹的熟食店
Poland and the deli in New Jersey that sells missiles.

405
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:37,955
太不可思议了
This is amazing.

406
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:39,857
我在纽约时报的复出
My comeback in The New York Times

407
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,292
被保存下来了
has been preserved.

408
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:43,628
Max 我要微笑着继续前进
Max, I'm gonna go ahead and smile.

409
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,363
我的生活又美好了
My life is good again.

410
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:47,331
先别笑 因为Sophie跟我说
Don't smile yet, 'cause Sophie told me

411
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:49,834
因为你说她品味很好
that because you said she had such good taste,

412
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,969
她正亲自设计我们的裙子
she's designing our dresses herself.

413
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,805
什么 只能开心一秒钟?
What was that, like a second?

414
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:57,408
是的 你刚刚从最好的时报
Yup. You just went from the best of times

415
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,408
走到了华沙时报
to The Warsaw Times.
