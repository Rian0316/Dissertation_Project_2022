1
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,200
Problem?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,610
This is the worst cobbler I've ever eaten.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,780
It tastes like it's made of actual ground-up shoemaker.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,350
Amusing. A play on the two meanings of "cobbler."

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,350

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,590
Hey   guys. Guess who I found at LAX?

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,920
My baby sister Priya.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,090
Excuse me   I object.

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,290
You propose a guessing game

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,260
yet you don't give me enough time to guess.

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,900
For the record   I was going to say:

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,160
"Your sister Priya."

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,730
Oh   Sheldon. You haven't changed a bit   have you?

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,840
Why would I change?

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,000
The hope has been that

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,070
you'd eventually bend to public opinion.

18
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,210
So   Priya   what brings you back to L.A.?

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,340
I have a one-day layover on my way to Toronto.

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,750
Corporate merger.

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,850
Can you believe it?

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,210
Little Priya's one of the lead attorneys

23
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,650
for the biggest car company in India.

24
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,690
Given that when we met her   she was finishing law school

25
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,060
and planning an internship at a large Indian car company

26
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,960
it's actually extremely plausible.

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,430
And your poll numbers just keep dropping.

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,730
I want to catch up with all of you

29
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,470
but first I really must visit the loo.

30
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,630
I'm going   too; I'll show you where it is.

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,900
All right   this goes without saying

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,600
but I'm just going to say it anyway.

33
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,870
Hands off my sister.

34
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,710
Why would I touch her? She's covered with airplane germs.

35
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,350
I'm so not talking to you. I'm talking to him.

36
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,050
- Hey. I've got a girlfriend now.  - Oh   please.

37
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,850
My sister's much hotter than your girlfriend

38
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,120
and you know it.

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,060
Let's just agree they're both hot.

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,230
But dude   that's my sister you're talking about!

41
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay   forget who's hotter.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,030
The first time Priya came to L.A.   Leonard and I made a pact

43
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,730
out of respect to our friendship and to you

44
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,840
that neither of us would hit on her.

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,470
Did you pinky-swear?

46
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,940
Yes.

47
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,680
Okay   then.

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,810
Cobbler. I'm still laughing.

49
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,180
It's really nice to see you again   Leonard.

50
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,290
Yeah. It's good to see you   too.

51
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,290
Here you go.

52
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,460
Thanks.

53
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,330
Whoa   whoa   whoa   whoa   whoa!

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,500
Okay.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,346
So you got any special plans with your sister?

56
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,746
Oh   not really. Just hang out.

57
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:50,416
I always tell people   "If you have only one day

58
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,986
in Los Angeles   make it a train day."

59
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:55,786
Train day?

60
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:59,156
The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City

61
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:02,296
a hotdog stand in a converted railroad dining car.

62
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:04,226
Next stop   Travel Town

63
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,726
an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines

64
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:11,336
cars   and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s.

65
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:15,306
And   finally   we're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood

66
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:19,206
for dinner at--that's right-- the Hollywood Carney's

67
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:24,076
a hotdog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.

68
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:27,186
I don't think we're going to do that.

69
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:30,616
Well   then apparently you hate fun.

70
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:37,056
Priya's not back yet?

71
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:38,526
Well   I guess that's not unusual.

72
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,926
Women   men   the whole sitting-standing deal.

73
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,396
So what are we talking about?

74
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,066
Uh   my plans with Priya.

75
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,036
He rejected Train Day.

76
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,606
Did you make it clear that it's two different train cars

77
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:50,476
turned into hotdog stands?

78
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:52,206
Abundantly.

79
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,106
I guess he just hates fun.

80
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:57,546
That's what I said!

81
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,356
Okay   so... what's new with you guys?

82
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,786
I have a girlfriend now.

83
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,156
Hey   good for you!

84
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:06,826
Yeah   I just want to put it out there

85
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:07,886
in case I inadvertently

86
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:10,656
squirt any pheromones in your direction.

87
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:12,596
Happy?

88
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:17,236
So   Priya   what are your plans while you're here?

89
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:19,236
I don't know. I just have the one day.

90
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:22,436
Do you like trains?

91
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:23,906
Not particularly.

92
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:31,076
You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.

93
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:34,286
"You are in a forest.

94
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:35,956
"There is quicksand to the west

95
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:39,986
a path leads to the east."

96
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:42,696
Go east.

97
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:46,626
"An iron gate blocks your way."

98
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:49,366
Open gate.

99
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:50,866
"It's locked."

100
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:53,036
Hmm.

101
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:55,206
Well   so much for that.

102
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:00,406
It's getting pretty late. How come you're still up?

103
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:04,446
I found an emulator online that lets you play classic text-based

104
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:06,916
computer games from the 1980s.

105
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,346
That's pretty cool.

106
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:11,756
Oh   yes. It runs on the world's most powerful graphics chip:

107
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:14,026
imagination.

108
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:16,826
You've really got to get out more.

109
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:20,866
Go north.

110
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:23,036
"You can't go that way."

111
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,766
Go west.

112
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:27,166
"A troll blocks your passage."

113
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,476
Okay. Fasten your seatbelts.

114
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,106
Kill troll.

115
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:34,746
"With what?"

116
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,846
With sword.

117
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,816
"You don't have the sword."

118
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,986
Good golly   it's as if it's actually happening to me.

119
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:45,786
Raj finally went to bed.

120
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:51,196
Sheldon's still up.

121
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:52,966
You said he goes to bed at 9:00.

122
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,666
Yeah   he does   but he got caught up in a computer game and...

123
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,396
Hit troll with axe!

124
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:01,766
Hit troll with axe!

125
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:04,436
Hit troll with axe!

126
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:06,846
My   this is one tough troll.

127
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:08,506
Can't you get rid of him?

128
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:11,316
If the past is any indication   no.

129
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:13,486
Leonard   I'm trapped in quicksand!

130
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:16,316
The axe is dragging me down!

131
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,416
Drop axe!

132
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,956
Drop axe   brilliant!

133
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:24,296
Give me a minute.

134
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,796
- Sheldon. - Hold on.

135
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:29,796
Trying to figure out how to get the bucket

136
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:32,266
so I can carry the mud past the dragon.

137
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,606
- Sheldon   you need to work in the morning. - I know!

138
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:36,606
Well   then bed   mister!

139
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,946
Five more minutes!

140
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:40,346
Really?

141
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,576
You're going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your

142
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,846
thermodynamic fluctuations seminar?

143
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:46,246
You know what happens when you yawn in public.

144
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:53,656
Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.

145
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,696
You don't want that   do you?

146
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:59,926
No.

147
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:04,766
But it's a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated.

148
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,306
Who was at the door?

149
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:09,306
Uh   building manager.

150
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:11,176
They have to fix a pipe

151
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:13,846
so the water'll be off tomorrow from noon to 2:00.

152
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:15,376
That's unacceptable.

153
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:16,816
We're supposed to be given written notice.

154
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,616
Well   no   it doesn't matter-- we'll be at work.

155
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:21,486
What if I spill tomato soup on my shirt

156
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:22,856
and have to come home to change

157
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:25,216
only to find there's no water for an enzyme soak?

158
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:27,326
Bifurcated uvula   Sheldon!

159
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:30,226
I'll have the chicken noodle. Good night!

160
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,796
We're going to have to be very quiet.

161
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:43,476
I know how to get the bucket!

162
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:45,436
I can turn the axe around

163
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:47,976
and use the handle to reach it.

164
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,946
Let's see.

165
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:52,386
Go north.

166
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,986
"You are in a forest."

167
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:55,686
Go north.

168
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:57,116
"You are in a forest."

169
00:07:57,116 --> 00:07:58,556
Go north.

170
00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:01,226
"You are in a forest." Oh dear   I believe I'm lost.

171
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:03,296
Well   I'll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.

172
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,196
No   no   no! You just took a wrong turn.

173
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:06,666
You just need to map it out.

174
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,666
Come on   I'll help you.

175
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,866
So you stopped at the stream   and you turned north three times?

176
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,606
Yes.

177
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,606
You're right. You're lost. Good luck.

178
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:22,246
Leonard. Wake up.

179
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:23,246
Huh? Wh-- Sorry.

180
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:24,776
For what?

181
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:27,216
I don't know. When I'm in bed with a girl   it's just--

182
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,116
it's my go-to response.

183
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:31,116
It's 6:00. I have to get back to Raj's

184
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:32,956
before he wakes up and realizes I'm gone.

185
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:35,326
Oh. Right. Sure.

186
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,856
I wish you could stay in L.A. a while longer.

187
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:38,856
Mmm   me   too.

188
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,396
You know   I was thinking

189
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:43,296
there are some great research facilities in India.

190
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:46,106
Where are you going with this   Leonard?

191
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:49,876
Well   I'm just saying   you know   I don't have any real ties here

192
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:53,076
so if I were to move to New Delhi   we could   you know--

193
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:55,946
go out.

194
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:59,586
Leonard   didn't we have this conversation five years ago?

195
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:00,546
Well   yes   but...

196
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:01,786
things have changed.

197
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,386
You know   you're older   I'm older--

198
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:05,586
Look   no more superhero bed sheets.

199
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,056
Sweetheart

200
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:10,056
just because we have fun when I come to town doesn't mean

201
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:12,666
I want to have a serious relationship.

202
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,026
- It doesn't? - Mm-mm.

203
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:18,296
And besides   I could never bring a white boy home to my parents.

204
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:20,366
They'd have a cow.

205
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,006
Which is a much bigger deal in India.

206
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:25,436
I'm not that white.

207
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:27,506
My great-great-grandmother was half Cherokee.

208
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:30,576
I know that's not the right kind of Indian   but it is something.

209
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:32,276
You're funny.

210
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:33,616
Leonard?

211
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:34,786
Leonard?

212
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:36,286
Leonard?

213
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,156
What?

214
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:39,756
I heard a woman laughing.

215
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:44,156
Oh   uh   yeah. I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.

216
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,796
Oh! Well   good job. Quite convincing.

217
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:51,266
I smell perfume.

218
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,336
Air freshener.

219
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:55,906
And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck?

220
00:09:55,906 --> 00:09:57,236
Rash. That's a bad rash.

221
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,836
My sympathies.

222
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:02,346
I'm no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis.

223
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,346
Can I interest you in a topical steroid

224
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:08,316
from my lotion and unguent collection?

225
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:11,316
Uh   yeah   yeah   that sounds great.

226
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:13,486
Very well. I'm sure I can find something

227
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:15,226
that will help you ditch that itch.

228
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:19,366
Okay   he's in the bathroom. Let's go.

229
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:25,036
Do you prefer ointment or cream?

230
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:28,436
Cream.

231
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:29,776
With or without a numbing agent?

232
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:30,776
Without.

233
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,176
Really   Leonard?

234
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:34,846
There are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.

235
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:36,796
Fine. With.

236
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,776
Prescription or non-prescription strength?

237
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:40,216
Use your best judgment.

238
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:44,986
Well   I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC.

239
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:48,386
It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed hemorrhoids

240
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:51,656
but it also goes nicely with non-mucosal body parts.

241
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:54,796
Sounds great.

242
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,436
Excellent choice.

243
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,846
Okay   hurry   hurry   hurry.

244
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:03,486
Come on   come on   come on.

245
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:06,926
Priya?

246
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:09,436
Good morning   Sheldon.

247
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:14,516
For shame   Leonard   for shame.

248
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:18,986
And to think   I was ready to waste

249
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:21,276
the last of my good hemorrhoid cream on you.

250
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,590
Making pretty good time   huh?

251
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,220
Is that really what you want to talk about   Leonard?

252
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,970
No.

253
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,940
What do you want to talk about?

254
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,070
Please don't tell anyone

255
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,540
I spent the night with Raj's sister.

256
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
There it is.

257
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,410
What if someone asks?

258
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,010
No one's going to ask if I spent the night with Raj's sister.

259
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,120
Perhaps   but they might ask me something else.

260
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,450
- Like what?  - Like

261
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,040
"Has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"

262
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,130
Priya and I are both adults.

263
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,830
I didn't betray Raj.

264
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,320
In fact   you did   but I was referring to Howard.

265
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,470
What are you talking about?

266
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,470
April 12   2005.

267
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,540
Bob's Big Boy   Toluca Lake.

268
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,140
Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time.

269
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,280
She was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion

270
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,050
in the form of a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger.

271
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,460
In order to preserve your friendship

272
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,520
you and Howard made a pinky swear

273
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,850
that neither of you would attempt to woo her.

274
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,900
I had a patty melt.

275
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,930
Okay   fine   I betrayed Howard.

276
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,860
- And Raj.  - All right   and Raj.

277
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,940
And me.

278
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,090
You?

279
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,870
Violation of the Roommate Agreement's

280
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,270
overnight guest notification clause.

281
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,140
Okay   fine   I-I'm a horrible human being.

282
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,240
I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

283
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,240

284
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,940
You're far too short to be Darth Vader.

285
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,320
At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.

286
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,180
My point is: Priya's gone and it would be much better

287
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,890
if no one else found out about us.

288
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,750
You mean you want me to keep a secret?

289
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,790
Yes.

290
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,460
You know I can't keep a secret.

291
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,530
You can if you try.

292
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,760
Think about it this way:

293
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,660
um   if I were Batman and you were Alfred

294
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,660

295
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,600
you'd keep that secret   right?

296
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,400
Why do you get to be Batman?

297
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,540
Because Batman has the secret.

298
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,370
Alfred has secrets   too.

299
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,940
- Like what?  - Alfred knows

300
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,610
that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl.

301
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,740
Which I've now just told to Batman.

302
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,430
See   I cannot keep a secret.

303
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,680
Ta-dah!

304
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,320
What?

305
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,660
Ta-dah.

306
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,690
It's short for...

307
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,660
Da-da-da-da! ?

308
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,290
Kind of busy here   Sheldon.

309
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,630
I know   that's why I shortened it.

310
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,160
What do you want?

311
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,870
I came to go over your alibi for last night.

312
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,300
What alibi?

313
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,570
You've asked me to lie on your behalf   and as you know

314
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,580
I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonesty

315
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,910
so I've provided you with an ironclad alibi.

316
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,580
You couldn't have spent last night with Priya

317
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,650
because you were with another woman.

318
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,890
Oh   I'm so sure I'm gonna regret this

319
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,990
but who was I with?

320
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,090
The fun-loving and morally loose Miss Maggie McGarry.

321
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,530
Oh   God.

322
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,480
You met her at Pasadena's most popular

323
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,960
Irish watering hole   Lucky Baldwin's

324
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,070
where Maggie spends her nights tending bar

325
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,270
with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.

326
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,380
"Leonard   call me if you are interested in coitus.

327
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,010
Sincerely   Maggie McGarry."

328
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,310
And if anyone were

329
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,220
to actually call that number   they will hear this.

330
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,320
Top of the morning to you.

331
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,490
You've reached Maggie McGarry.

332
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,860
Leave a message after the wee little beep.

333
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,260
It's pretty convincing   huh?

334
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,530
That wasn't even a real person.

335
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,800
And here is the clincher:

336
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,440
a lock of Maggie's flaming auburn hair.

337
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,710
Where'd you get that?

338
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,510
From an orangutan in the primate lab.

339
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,610
An orangutan?

340
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,710
Well   no one's going to run a DNA test on it   Leonard.

341
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,780
Honestly   you overthink everything.

342
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,090
Sheldon   I don't need an alibi.

343
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,860
Nobody's going to ask about last night

344
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,290
as long as you just zip your lip.

345
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,900
Thank you.

346
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,230
Now   don't worry   everything is going to be fine.

347
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,230

348
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,180
Hey.

349
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,410
Hey   Leonard   will you please tell Howard

350
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,550
my sister has never been attracted to him?

351
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,660
Come on   Raj

352
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,170
how am I supposed to know

353
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,400
who she is attracted to or was attracted to

354
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,040
or who she might be attracted to in the future?

355
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,680
And I have nothing to contribute

356
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,550
to this conversation.

357
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,550
Because I   too   know absolutely nothing

358
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,620
about Priya's preferences in male companionship.

359
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,120
And with that   I will re-zip my lip.

360
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,330
Hey   so what did you guys think

361
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,360
of the new episode of Caprica last night?

362
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,330
I didn't see it.

363
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,260
Didn't see it?

364
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,860
What were you doing?

365
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,800
Uh   I was out.

366
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
What   on Caprica night?

367
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,910
Yeah   I   uh   went for a drink.

368
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,140
Really   you?

369
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,910
Where   w-where'd you go?

370
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,150
To   uh...

371
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,090
Lucky Baldwin's.

372
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,990
Oh   I've heard of that place.

373
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,730
Isn't that Pasadena's favorite Irish watering hole?

374
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,500
Yes.

375
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,800
Did you meet

376
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,070
anyone interesting there

377
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,300
perhaps a promiscuous   redheaded barmaid?

378
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,310
As a matter of fact... I-I-I-I-I can't   I can't

379
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,740
I can't do it.

380
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,310
Sure you can   you're doing fine   it's very believable.

381
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,780
I'm sorry   Raj   but the truth is

382
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,650
I was with Priya last night.

383
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,850
Don't listen to him.

384
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,620
He's still light-headed from all the Irish whiskey

385
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,490
and pickled eggs in his system.

386
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,420
What were you doing with Priya?

387
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,460
I believe they engaged in coitus

388
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,260
but more importantly

389
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,030
if Leonard had not abandoned his story

390
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,460
would you have found it plausible?

391
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,000
You slept with my sister?!

392
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,930
Yeah.

393
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,170
How could you? We had a pact.

394
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,970
Excuse me   I think "How could you? She's my sister"

395
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,170
takes precedence over a five-year-old pinky swear.

396
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,610
May I point out

397
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,840
in a parallel universe   your friends are saying

398
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,480
"Maggie McGarry-- she sounds lovely."

399
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,950
Look   I-I admit it   I may have crossed a line here

400
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,520
but come on   Raj   your sister is a grown woman

401
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,420
and to her   I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.

402
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,520
I don't believe it.

403
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,930
This is a terrible betrayal of my trust.

404
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,590
No   w-w-would it help if I told you

405
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,530
that I offered her my heart   and she kind of stomped on it?

406
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,300
How hard did she stomp?

407
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Very hard.

408
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,640
Okay   I'm good.

409
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,680
Well   Raj

410
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,080
I just want to say that I'd never betray your trust.

411
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,650
Unlike Leonard   I respect you.

412
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,650
Really?

413
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,320
Mm-hmm.

414
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,450
Was it out of respect that you didn't tell Raj

415
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,090
about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?

416
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,230
Dude   I put that thing on my face!

417
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,100
I think a more amusing violation of Raj's trust

418
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,730
is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents

419
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,670
to Americans on Thanksgiving.

420
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,070
Hey   I didn't see you giving back

421
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,910
your Snoopy snow cone maker.

422
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,040
That was all a lie?

423
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,180
This year's gifts are already wrapped.

424
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,910
And as long as we're talking about betraying our friends

425
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,380
how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects

426
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,120
and mixing them into Leonard's food?

427
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,490
Well   excuse me.

428
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,090
That was not a betrayal.

429
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,220
That was an experiment to determine

430
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,430
at what concentration food starts tasting "mothy."

431
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,600
You put moths in my food?!

432
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,470
For science.

433
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,940
I can't believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.

434
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,110
Well   I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush.

435
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,410
You used my toothbrush?

436
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,310
Not the brush part   just the little rubber thing

437
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,150
to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.

438
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,830
Okay   I-I think it's safe to say

439
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,330
that we've all done some things

440
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,100
we're not particularly proud of.

441
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,260
But come on   we're friends.

442
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,240
Friends overlook each other's minor lapses.

443
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,240
For the record   Howard   I'm sorry that I broke our pact.

444
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,580
Thank you.

445
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,410
And I'm sorry about your phone

446
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,210
and Thanksgiving.

447
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,580
And while we're at it

448
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,020
you don't have to wash our clothes on the Fourth of July.

449
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,590
As long as we're apologizing

450
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,820
Sheldon   I'm   I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.

451
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,060
And I'm sorry...

452
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,560
but that behavior is beyond the pale

453
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,230
and cannot be tolerated.

454
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,360
We are no longer friends.

455
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,400
I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

456
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,370
With real puffing smoke?

457
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,610
Yes.

458
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,940
All right.

459
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,950
But I'm watching you.

460
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,970
Hey   you've got Snoopy out.

461
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,170
Can I have a snow cone?

462
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,040
Well   sure.

463
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
This is pretty good.

464
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,250
What flavor is this?

465
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,150
Guess.

466
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,750
- Papaya? - No.

467
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,390
- Guava? - You're so close.

468
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,390
I give up.

469
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,790
Mango caterpillar.

470
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,960
What are you doing?!

471
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,930
You said you liked it.
