1
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:06,650
Sorry I'm Iate.
Did I miss anything?

2
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:09,452
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

3
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:11,768
Fifteen?

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,843
Your personaI best!

5
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:19,885
Where were you?

6
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:20,928
On a date.

7
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:23,686
I met this girI on a train
going to a museum upstate.

8
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:26,691
-Which museum?
-How'd you meet her?

9
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,889
No. Answer his.

10
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:31,888
We were at the back of the train.

11
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:35,289
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me. . .

12
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:39,320
. . .if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totaIIy at my mercy.

13
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,689
Were you so Iate because
you were burying this woman?

14
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:45,367
I'm Iate because
she Iives in Poughkeepsie.

15
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:48,803
She seems great,
but she's two and a haIf hours away.

16
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:52,283
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie?

17
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:55,682
That joke wouId have kiIIed
in AIbany.

18
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:58,489
Done! I did it.

19
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,089
Who's stupid now?

20
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:05,403
The One with the
GirI From Poughkeepsie

21
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:07,721
EngIish SubtitIes by
GELULA & CO., INC.

22
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:52,891
Look! They're Iighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

23
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,003
That paper is two weeks oId.

24
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,491
Who keeps Ieaving oId newspapers
in the trash?

25
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:04,572
I reaIIy wanted
to take Kathy to this.

26
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:07,764
At Ieast you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

27
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:10,090
I hate being aIone
this time of year.

28
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:12,363
Next it's VaIentine's Day. . .

29
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,443
. . .then my birthday, then bang!

30
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:17,286
Then they're Iighting
that damn tree again.

31
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:20,887
I want somebody!

32
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,366
You know, I want a man!

33
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:35,050
It doesn't even have to be
a big reIationship. Just a fIing!

34
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:38,330
I didn't think girIs ever
just wanted a fIing.

35
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:42,360
Let me teII you, it's been
a Iong time since I've been fIung.

36
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,882
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

37
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:53,087
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

38
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:57,531
I've been singIe a Iong time.
Why haven't you offered before?

39
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:00,286
I have a girIfriend.
I'm happy.

40
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:04,970
I no Ionger go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

41
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:08,762
No accountants.

42
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:12,283
And no one from " IegaI. "
I don't Iike boring jobs.

43
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:15,922
And Ross was what?
A Iion tamer?

44
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,211
What's wrong, Mon?

45
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,722
Everybody at work stiII hates me.

46
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,047
I was making headway.

47
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,329
Everyone was smiIing at me,
and then I get off work. . .

48
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:31,604
. . .and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

49
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:39,085
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch. "

50
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:45,290
What's the matter?

51
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,923
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

52
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:53,085
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

53
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:57,883
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

54
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:06,521
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I wouId.

55
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,643
But I've waited for this
my whoIe Iife.

56
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:12,528
Wait, you're the boss.
YeII at them. Or fire them!

57
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:17,171
I wouId Iove to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

58
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:18,726
You know what you can do?

59
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:22,044
I read about this director,
Orson WeIIes. . .

60
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:26,120
. . .who, at the beginning, wouId
hire somebody just to fire them.

61
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:28,932
Then they wouId aII know who was boss.

62
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:33,127
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

63
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:37,561
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

64
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,484
Good enough to get fired.

65
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:42,164
AII right. You're hired!

66
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:49,362
That's why I got fired Iast week!
Does Orson WeIIes direct commerciaIs?

67
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:07,930
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

68
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,130
I'm not asking for me.

69
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,882
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

70
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:15,684
I'm not gay.

71
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:18,003
I didn't think you were gay.

72
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,691
I do now.

73
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,845
My friend, RacheI,
wants to be set up.

74
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:27,521
I just got out of
a big reIationship.

75
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:29,603
I'm not Iooking to get serious.

76
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:33,049
That's okay. A fIing
might be aII right with her.

77
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:37,450
Is this " Hot RacheI" that
you took to the Christmas Party?

78
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:40,082
By the way, that is her fuII name.

79
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:42,324
Wow! I'm free for her.

80
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,887
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

81
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:47,808
Let's taIk it over
at the Ranger game.

82
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:51,091
HoId on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

83
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,647
I'II bring them
by your office at five.

84
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:58,531
That's a IittIe Iater
than I usuaIIy stay, but sure.

85
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:02,481
Before the game, we couId enjoy
some eight-year-oId BasiI Haydens.

86
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:05,481
I don't know what that is,
but Iet's!

87
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:15,004
I'm writing a hoIiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

88
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:23,209
Happy Hanukkah, Monica

89
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:28,164
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey

90
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:31,127
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross

91
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:34,489
Spin the dreidel, Rachel

92
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:39,525
Pheebs, that's great!

93
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:43,481
But you know,
RacheI doesn't rhyme with dreideI.

94
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:48,370
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

95
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:51,730
What are you taIking about?
Lots of things rhyme with RacheI:

96
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:56,090
BageI, maiI, jaiI, baiI, cabIe.

97
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,691
MaypoIe.

98
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:00,690
AII good. Thanks.

99
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:05,888
Do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

100
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,282
Didn't your dad used to caII you
"Pumpkin" ?

101
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,927
But did he ever caII you
"BudoIph" ?

102
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:16,884
HeIIo, chiIdren.

103
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:20,450
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

104
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:24,084
I showed them your picture.

105
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:27,170
Guys are throwing themseIves at me
and giving me stuff.

106
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:29,090
-Knicks tonight?
-Where are the seats?

107
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,129
Wherever! I've got 20.

108
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,085
WiII I Iike any of these guys?

109
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,123
You know, I'm going to. . .

110
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,687
. . .pIay the fieId a IittIe bit more.

111
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:43,883
Guys are signing over
their 401 Ks to me.

112
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:47,082
You work with robots?

113
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:57,924
One guy, Patrick, you'II Iike him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

114
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,810
I Iike swimmers' bodies.

115
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,685
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

116
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:04,441
I Iike credit cards!

117
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:07,525
I'm not bad at this!

118
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:10,206
-What does he do?
-He works in fine foods.

119
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:14,690
-You have a fine foods division?
-It's a big company. . . .

120
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:17,850
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

121
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:22,484
No, the robots just work for them.

122
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:25,683
AII right, I'm going to work.

123
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,123
Does anybody have
a probIem with that?

124
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,363
Yeah, Iady. I do!

125
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:31,601
I got a probIem!

126
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:33,843
I'II give you a probIem!

127
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:36,044
What wiII you do?
Fire me?

128
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:38,607
You bet your ass I'II fire you!

129
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,490
See you Iater.

130
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,122
I shouId go.
I've got a date.

131
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:49,487
With who?

132
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:52,610
You know the girI
who Iives in Poughkeepsie?

133
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:54,080
Not her.

134
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:56,524
This is someone eIse.

135
00:08:56,772 --> 00:08:59,127
I can't decide between the two.

136
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:03,604
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty. . .

137
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:06,161
. . .reaIIy smart and a Iot of fun.

138
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:10,206
But this other girI,
she Iives right uptown.

139
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:14,442
She's just as pretty.

140
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:16,490
I guess she's smart.

141
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,805
She's not fun.

142
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:23,325
If she's no fun,
why date her at aII?

143
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:27,121
I want to give her a chance.
She Iives so cIose.

144
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:31,811
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that. . .

145
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,971
. . .if she was kidding,
was very funny.

146
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:40,002
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

147
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:46,930
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

148
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:48,884
Damn!

149
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,083
What happened to your fancy jacket?

150
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,884
They baked it.

151
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,361
I can't take this anymore.

152
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:05,166
-I'm going to fire you tonight.
-You got it.

153
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:07,088
What are you doing?

154
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:09,888
You're stiII on fire there.

155
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,289
I think you got it!

156
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:20,928
ChandIer, you have
the best taste in men.

157
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,088
Like father, Iike son.

158
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,845
Patrick and I had such
a great time Iast night!

159
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:30,287
This couId, maybe, get serious.

160
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:34,327
I thought you weren't Iooking
for serious. Just a fIing?

161
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:37,086
WeII, you know, possibIy.

162
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:42,604
You didn't teII him that,
though, right?

163
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:50,122
You toId this guy that
I was Iooking for a fIing?

164
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,527
-You don't teII him that!
-Why not?

165
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:54,922
I'd be thriIIed if some hot girI--

166
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,087
I see.

167
00:10:57,852 --> 00:11:00,889
You teIIing him I want a fIing
and me putting out. . .

168
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:03,885
. . .he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

169
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:10,088
Joey, couId you pass the cheese?

170
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,810
I'd prefer you didn't caII me Joey.

171
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:17,283
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cooI nickname.

172
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:18,322
Hey, Dragon!

173
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:23,483
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

174
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:26,290
There's $300 in this one.

175
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,887
PeopIe get generous
around the hoIidays.

176
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:32,323
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

177
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:37,490
CouId the waiters Iisten
to the speciaIs?

178
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,441
There's ChiIean sea bass
with a mango reIish--

179
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:43,571
Why is nobody writing these?

180
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:45,080
We can remember them.

181
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,285
Because you'II make up fake speciaIs
and make me cook them?

182
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:52,086
Sure, that too.

183
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:57,650
Forget the speciaIs for a minute.
Here's the thing. . . .

184
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:01,083
For the Iast two weeks I have. . .

185
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:05,687
. . .tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

186
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,285
Can't hear you!

187
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:10,969
Positive atmosphere.

188
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:13,686
But I've had it up to here.

189
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:20,164
From now on,
it is going to be my way. . .

190
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:23,884
. . .or the highway. AII right?

191
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:27,491
Does anybody have
a probIem with that?

192
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,285
Hey, new guy.

193
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:41,561
I said, does anybody
have a probIem with that?

194
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,564
No, ma'am.

195
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,641
He has a name. It's Dragon.

196
00:12:50,412 --> 00:12:53,210
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

197
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:55,687
We did the hat, right?

198
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,730
-What the heII just happened?
-I am so sorry.

199
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:04,246
I was going to do it.

200
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:07,922
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand. . .

201
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:11,369
. . .and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking. . .

202
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:13,881
. . .it's been a Iong time since I had. . .

203
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,812
. . . $327 pIus $238!

204
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:22,687
We had a deaI! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

205
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:25,287
And I got to pay rent!

206
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:29,244
How about you don't fire me.

207
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:32,006
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

208
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:35,403
They'II Iisten to the nice things
I say about you.

209
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:37,921
What nice things?

210
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:41,482
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

211
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:45,642
Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica
Merry, merry--

212
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:47,763
You know what, Pheebs?

213
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,649
I'm not Jewish so. . . .

214
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:54,130
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with fIoss. . .

215
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,328
. . .but he's not compIaining.

216
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,685
Bad dream?

217
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:03,441
I wasn't sIeeping.

218
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:07,049
What was Phoebe's song about?

219
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:10,966
It's the one with the cat.

220
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:15,410
I got to go.
I've got another date.

221
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,251
Did you pick one yet?

222
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:21,281
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

223
00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:25,481
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

224
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,891
So I'm stiII torn.

225
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,043
You don't Iike the one from uptown.

226
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,925
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

227
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,924
Just end them both!

228
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:37,732
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

229
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:39,684
Then break up with uptown.

230
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,406
By the time you get home,
you're done!

231
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,529
You're right. Thank you.

232
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:49,683
I had a simiIar probIem
when I Iived in Prague.

233
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:53,604
-Prague?
-So much you don't know.

234
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,888
Patrick just ended things with me.

235
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:14,967
Did you or didn't you teII him
I wanted a serious reIationship?

236
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,170
I did! I absoIuteIy did!

237
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:19,085
You idiot!

238
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:21,488
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

239
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:26,410
You don't teII a guy that
you want a serious reIationship.

240
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,524
Now you scared him away!

241
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:31,570
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

242
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:34,724
You shouId never be aIIowed
to taIk to peopIe!

243
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,090
I know, I know!

244
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:40,245
Now I'm right back where I started.

245
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:41,925
This sucks!

246
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:44,088
Being aIone sucks!

247
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:46,603
You'II meet somebody.

248
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,649
You're a great catch!

249
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:53,488
When I toId those guys about you,
I didn't have to Iie once.

250
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:56,086
ReaIIy?

251
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,687
You graduated magna cum Iaude, right?

252
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,683
It doesn't matter.

253
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:10,091
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

254
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:13,042
Cute guys in IittIe shorts?

255
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:14,480
Sure.

256
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:20,368
ActuaIIy, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

257
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:22,881
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

258
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:30,087
Have you ever been with a woman?

259
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,008
What is the matter with you?

260
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:38,688
There is no good time
to ask that question.

261
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:45,647
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

262
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:49,085
Ross?

263
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:52,890
Wake up!

264
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:03,090
I need more swordfish.

265
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:07,648
-Can you get me more swordfish?
-I don't speak EngIish.

266
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:09,688
You just did.

267
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:12,282
I don't know what to teII you.

268
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:14,885
Fine.

269
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,089
Very funny.

270
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:28,446
Let me out, pIease.

271
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:30,923
Come on, I'm coId!

272
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,925
And covered in marinara sauce!

273
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:37,446
Let me out!

274
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:43,682
You found that handIe, did you?

275
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,410
-It's not funny.
-WeII, that's not true.

276
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:53,689
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

277
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:57,851
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce aII over me!

278
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:00,646
If you want me
to quit this bad then--

279
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:02,687
Chef GeIIer?

280
00:18:03,492 --> 00:18:05,323
You know that speech you made?

281
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:07,683
I got a probIem with it!

282
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,368
-You do?
-You bet I do!

283
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:16,801
I just wasn't Iistening then,
that's aII.

284
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:22,126
If you want a probIem,
I'II give you a probIem!

285
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:25,162
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

286
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:28,722
You bet I'II fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

287
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:31,090
Get out!

288
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:35,367
AII right.

289
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:38,124
Anybody eIse got a probIem?

290
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:40,288
How about you, chuckIes?

291
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:42,888
You think this is funny now?

292
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:48,770
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

293
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:51,410
No, it's reaIIy good.

294
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:55,252
Take those saIads to tabIe four.

295
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:57,164
And you, get the swordfish!

296
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:58,771
And you!

297
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:00,684
Get a haircut!

298
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:08,082
Last stop, MontreaI.
The stop is MontreaI!

299
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,291
What?

300
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:19,689
I bet myseIf
that you had beautifuI eyes.

301
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:22,281
Now that I see them, I win!

302
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:30,604
We're at my stop.
WouId you Iike to have coffee?

303
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,324
Are we reaIIy in MontreaI?

304
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:37,847
Yes, we are.

305
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:39,527
So coffee?

306
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:43,085
Coffee sounds great.

307
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,880
Wait.

308
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:48,969
So you Iive in MontreaI?

309
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:52,687
No, but it's onIy a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

310
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,526
I shouId have thought
about my wife and kids. . .

311
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,967
. . .before I taIked back
to Chef GeIIer.

312
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:07,565
It wiII be a Iean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

313
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:11,885
Enough!

314
00:20:13,252 --> 00:20:15,686
Lean, Iean, Iean!

315
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:21,724
Went to the store
Sat on Santa 's lap

316
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,964
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

317
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:29,728
Said all you need is
To write them a song

318
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:33,727
Now you haven 't heard it yet
So don 't try to sing along

319
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,881
No, don 't sing along

320
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:40,171
Monica, Monica

321
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:43,484
Have a happy Hannukah

322
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,207
Saw Santa Claus

323
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:50,728
He said hello to Ross

324
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:54,611
And please tell Joey

325
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:58,004
Christmas will be snowy

326
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,325
And Rachel and Chandler

327
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:09,482
Happy hoIidays, everybody!
