<i>Nora looked for trouble and found it...

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,790
You will never again see my husband.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,720
<i>Julie got to know Edie's nephew...

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,330
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,350
I felt violated.

7
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,380
<i>Susan and Ian made plans...

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,080
I'd love to go to France someday.

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,410
Would you like to go next month?

10
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,530
<i>Gabrielle and Carlos reunited...

11
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,590
It's been a long time.

12
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,500
<i>And dinner with the Bigsbys...

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,620
That's the police report that Alma
filed after Orson hit her.

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,610
Was full of surprises.

15
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,860
Look, I'm going through something.

16
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,370
I had an affair.

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,680
Friday.

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,850
<i>It was supposed to be an ordinary
day for Carolyn Bigsby.

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,440
<i>She had planned to bake her husband a strudel,

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,920
<i>give her dog a bath

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,200
<i>and water her African violets.

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,680
<i>Yes, Carolyn had planned to do all sorts
of things she thought mattered.

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,430
<i>But earlier that day, a woman who wasn't her friend

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,870
<i>told Carolyn something she wasn't supposed to hear.

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,800
<i>From that moment on, Carolyn felt

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,260
<i>nothing really mattered anymore.

Hello, Carolyn.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,550

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,250
Carolyn?

33
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,250
What are you doing here?

34
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,390
I've been thinking, Harvey, that if you loved this

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,520
Monique woman so much, maybe you should be with her.

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,300
For God's sakes, Carolyn, she's dead.

37
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,720
Yeah, I know.

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,030
<i>Yes, Carolyn Bigsby had planned on
it being an ordinary day...

39
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,310
Harvey!

40
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,590
You come out of there, damn it!

41
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,050
<i>But as every housewife knows...

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,550
Down.
Nobody goes anywhere.

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,880
<i>Plans change.

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,460
<i>(The night before)

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,990
<i>Lynette scavo had a dream last night.

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,220
<i>It was one she'd had many times before.

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,440
<i>She dreamt of the last time she saw me...

48
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,750
<i>and of the last time we spoke.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,030
Hey!

50
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,820
Mary Alice, are you okay?

51
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,170
Yes, thank you.

52
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,270
I'm fine.

53
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,440
Okay.
See you later.

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,410
<i>It was still hard for Lynette to accept

55
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,690
<i>that this unremarkable exchange had been our last,

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,610
<i>or that moments later,

57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,420
<i>I would enter my house and put
a bullet through my brain.

58
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,920
<i>(Friday morning)

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,940
I had the Mary Alice dream again last night.

60
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,120
Oh, hon, again?

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,770
I haven't had it for months.
I don't know why it came back.

62
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,940
Well, somebody just bought her old house.
Maybe that triggered something.

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,180
It was awful, as always.

64
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,040
I saw she was in pain, and I just walked away and...

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,840
there was nothing you could do.

66
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,920
And that's what I did--
nothing.

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,520
Hey, is that the new neighbor?

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,400
- Oh, he's cute!
- Edie said he's a bachelor...

69
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,980
- Keep talkin'.
- Who lives with his invalid sister.

70
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,000
You can stop now.

71
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,570
Should we go introduce ourselves?

72
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,450
Yeah, let's give him the scoop on the neighborhood.

73
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,980
Do you think he knows Mary Alice
shot herself in his living room?

74
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,900
Then again, he probably wants some time to unpack.

75
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Orson?

76
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,080
If you have a moment, there's something
I'd like your thoughts on.

77
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,050
Certainly.
What is it?

78
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,750
The menu for our holiday open house?

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,160
No, it's the police report from the
night you beat your first wife.

80
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm still working on the menu.

81
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,360
I assure you, I did not beat my wife.

82
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,370
She suffered these injuries in a fall.

83
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, how did she fall?

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,590
I pushed her.

85
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,150
It was self-defense.
She attacked me.

86
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,950
Why would she attack you?

87
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,620
She spilled some red wine on a white tablecloth.

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,260
She was trying to clean it up with dish soap.

89
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,680
When I pointed out her mistake,
she started screaming, "Shut up, shut up!"

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,230
And striking me repeatedly 
with a sauté pan.

91
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,040
Well, look...

92
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,470
The police dropped the charges.

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,580
Where did you get this?

94
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,250
Carolyn.

95
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,370
Well, of course.
Who else?

96
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,280
If she paid this much attention to her own marriage,
maybe Harvey wouldn't have cheated on her.

97
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,890
Harvey cheated?

98
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,560
Yes, with some flight attendant named moniqu

99
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,710
Darling, I could never strike a woman.

100
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,020
Well, you do believe me, don't you?

101
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,550
All right, I accept your explanation.

102
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,240
I just wish there were fewer things
for you to explain.

103
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,050
By the way, to remove a red wine stain,
you sprinkle salt to absorb it.

104
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,870
That's just what I was saying to Alma
when she clocked me.

105
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,500
Whoa, what fresh hell is this?

106
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,790
- Hey, Tom--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

107
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,590
You have stepped onto my property,
and you've talked to Tom.

108
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,330
That's two rules you've broken,
and I'm not sure that top doesn't make three.

109
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,920
Would you tell your lunatic wife
I'm not talking to her?

110
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,540
You're the lunatic if you think
I'm letting you anywhere

111
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,230
near my husband.
- Just drop Kayla off and go.

112
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,500
Kayla won't be visiting today.

113
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,440
We're moving.

114
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,910
And here's where you can send the child support.

115
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,540
Mexico?

116
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:49,910
Mm, an old friend of mine got me a sweet job
dancing at a nightclub in tijuana.

117
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,670
Eat, and you're taking Kayla?

118
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,140
Thank your wife.

119
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,900
She's been itching to get rid of us
ever since we got here.

120
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,420
She finally got her way.

121
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,850
Wave bye-bye to your Daddy, honey.

122
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,350
Nora, can't--
can't we just talk about this?

123
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,770
Oh, we're not allowed to talk.

124
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,740
Remember?

125
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,010
She's Tom's daughter.
You can't just take her out of the country.

126
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,710
Watch me.

127
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,700
Does either party have anything to add 
before I rule on the division of assets and alimony?

128
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,180
No, we're confident that your ruling will reflect
the pain and suffering endured by my client.

129
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,820
Your honor, does the definition of "suffering"
encompass the seduction of my client four days ago?

130
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,930
Excuse me?

131
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,380
She thought he was coming into some money and hoped
to stall the divorce until she could claim her share.

132
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,140
How dare you!
That is a vicious lie.

133
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,030
Oh, Carlos, give it to me!

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,620
Carlos!
Yes! Yes!

135
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,890
Carlos--

136
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,250
You recorded our lovemaking?

137
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,800
It's all right here, your honor.

138
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,200
When she climaxes, she actually starts
screaming out dollar amounts.

139
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,320
Mrs. Solis...

140
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,880
Would you like to respond?

141
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,610
As a matter of fact, I do have a few thoughts.

142
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,780
Carlos, you're a dead man!
Do you hear me?

143
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,390
Oh, the ruling seems fair to me.
You get the housE.

144
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,150
I just get everything in it.

145
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,000
I said dead!

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,420
No alimony.
That's a drag.

147
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,340
But, hey, you like to work, right?

148
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,610
Come on, just give me one clean shot at him.
I'm willing to do the time!

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,690
Mom, I was packing your suitcase,
and you're totally out of toothpaste.

150
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,480
Do you want me to go to the store and get some?

151
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,230
What is this?

152
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,710
Oh, um, it was austin's, okay?

153
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,110
Edie's nephew?
Since when are you friends with him?

154
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,030
Uh, we are not friends. I was tutoring him,
he brought beer,

155
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,560
I told him to throw it out, and he did.
End of story.

156
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,260
Did you have any?

157
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,450
Oh, I cannot believe your timing.

158
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,020
I'm about to fly off to Paris,
and you're inviting boys over for oktoberfest.

159
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,200
Oh, that's it!Go to your room and finishing packing.
This conversation's over.

160
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,810
Last time I checked, I was the parent.

161
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,220
Yeah, well, the last time i checked, I was the
daughter who never gave you any reason to doubt her.

162
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,190
- Okay, I-I know I--
- and don't play the parent card with me.

163
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,690
I just finished packing your suitcase,
doing your laundry and balancing your checkbook.

164
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,020
And now I'm going to the store to
buy your toothpaste.

165
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,090
Well, a simple "no, I didn't drink any beer"
would've sufficed.

166
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,080
Bree!

167
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,880
You haven't returned any of my calls.
I've been worried.

168
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,010
Have you told the wife-beater you're leaving him yet?

169
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,400
Sorry, no.

170
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,070
Turns out he has an explanation for the police report.

171
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,170
Oh, come on.
There's never a good reason for hitting a woman.

172
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,990
I used to think that, too.
Then I met you.

173
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,450
Good day.

174
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,640
I'm trying to help you.
You're living in a fool's paradise.

175
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,950
Well, I guess that makes us neighbors.

176
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,470
What's that supposed to mean?

177
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,760
It means you should stop worrying about
my marriage and start worrying about your own.

178
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,660
Don't play coy with me.

179
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,570
You've got something to say, then just say it.

180
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,680
Okay.
Does the name "Monique" mean anything to you?

181
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,730
Hey, I found this site that offers
really cheap fares to tijuana,

182
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,790
but should i even be thinking of going to tijuana?

183
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,740
It's fine with me, soon as you figure out
a way to leave your genitals here.

184
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,680
What are you saying, Lynette?
I'm not allowed to visit my daughter?What?

185
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,090
See?
This is exactly what she wants.

186
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,620
She takes Kayla, and I get blamed.

187
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,750
Well, screw her.
Let's sue for custody.

188
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,750
Full custody?
You-- you'd go for that?

189
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,380
U bet I would.

190
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,350
Kayla will be much better off without
"crazy" in her life.

191
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,720
So will we.

192
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,410
I'm--
I am right there with you.

193
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,120
I just--
I never thought you'd want a fifth kid.

194
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,190
I don't, but I didn't want the first four,
and they're starting to grow on me.

195
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,020
Hey, look whose plastic handcuffs got taken off.

196
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,810
Okay, you' clearly still a little
miffed about the settlement.

197
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,530
But come on, be fair.

198
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,790
I did buy most of the stuff in this house, honey.

199
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,410
What the hell are you doing?!

200
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,950
Oh, I'm helping you pack. Think of all the
money you're gonna save on bubble wrap.

201
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,570
Hey!
Do you know how much that was worth?!

202
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,100
Do you know how much I was worth?!

203
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,840
When we met, I was on the cover of magazines.

204
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,440
I had a career and a future,
but I gave it all up for you,

205
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,310
and what did I get in return?

206
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,240
If you break one more thing, so help me...

207
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,950
What?
What are you gonna do?

208
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,210
Carlos, have you lost your mind?!

209
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,360
Well, you're helping me pack my stuff.

210
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,520
I'm helping you remodel your house.

211
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,490
You know, I don't know about you,

212
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,830
but I always thought there should be
a window that was right there.

213
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,060
We can stop this right now,
or we can keep on playing.

214
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,560
Your call.

215
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,540
Toothpaste, mouthwash...
Did somebody get an anonymous e-mail?

216
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,590
Said the boy with the economy-sized acne cream.

217
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,710
There you go again, checking out my basket.

218
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,340
Ugh, go away. Do you know how much trouble
your stupid beer can got me in?

219
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,020
Well, then let me make it up to you.
I'll carry your stuff.

220
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,940
Whatever.

221
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,400
Yeah?

222
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,650
Harvey, it's me.

223
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey, hon, I'm in the middle of something here,
so, um...

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,880
I know about Monique.

225
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,840
Um, could you excuse me a second?

226
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,160
Attention, shoppers, welcome to Fields market...

227
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,090
Look, I don't know who you've
been talking to, but, um--

228
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,620
Did you love her?

229
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,920
She was just a friend,
and she disappeared eight months ago.

230
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,170
The police just found her body.

231
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,110
Eight months ago.
That's right when you fell into that big depression.

232
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,330
And I kept thinking, "Why is Harvey so blue?

233
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,050
"How do I cheer him up?"
That was about her, wasn't it?

234
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,070
It's over.

235
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,190
She's dead.

236
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,790
But if she weren't,

237
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,650
who would you be with--me or her?

238
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,950
She's dead.

239
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,020
That'll be $12.99.
I'll take your Fields card.

240
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,820
Couldn't keep your wallet in your pants?

241
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,060
Mr. Bigsby?

242
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,080
Look, um...

243
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,560
I gotta go.

244
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,650
Mommy, look at us!

245
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,120
I'll look as soon as I get back from the store.

246
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,700
Bye, mom!

247
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,120
This is Edie.

248
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,230
Yeah, I'm his aunt.

249
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,330
He shoplifted what?

250
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Be right there.

251
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,610
You're still packing?
We're-- well, we're going to be late.

252
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,500
Nope, we're fine. Besides, I can't leave
until Julie gets back with my toothpaste.

253
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,840
Oh, we don't need it.
I packed a large tube and some dental floss.

254
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,360
Really?

255
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,360
What--why are Americans so amazed when the english
display the slightest acquaintance with dental hygiene?

256
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,760
Okay, I'm gonna need some help with this big baby.

257
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,880
Go!
Zip, zip, zip!

258
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,110
Uh, Susan, do-- do you really need all this?
I mean, we're not emigrating.

259
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,960
It's my first time in Paris.
I want it to be magical,

260
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,340
and that means accessories, so back off.

261
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,490
It's the fashion capital of the world.

262
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,690
Uh, while I'm working, you can take
my credit card and buy some new things.

263
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,230
No, no, I am not gonna spend your money.

264
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,280
I have an expense account.

265
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,450
And you just tell me this now?

266
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,740
I'll tell the driver you'll be a minute.

267
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,690
Hello?

268
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,780
Yes, this is her mother.

269
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,510
What?

270
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,110
Well, you're gonna love the neighborhood.

271
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,780
- Oh?
- Are you all moved in?

272
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,170
Uh, pretty much.
Just waiting on some medical equipment for my sister.

273
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,490
Oh, yeah, I heard she isn't well.
Can I ask what's wrong with her?

274
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,250
Oh, of course.
Unfortunately, she has this rare degenerative--

275
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,600
Oh, that's rough.
Excuse me.

276
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,540
You told me you weren't even friends with him.
Now you're shoplifting together?

277
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,000
- Mom, you know I wouldn't steal.
- Yeah, I wanna believe that,

278
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,080
but suddenly you're having boys over,
you're drinking beer--

279
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,520
and soon she'll be listening to that rock 'n'
roll music everybody's talking about.

280
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,040
So how are we gonna handle this?

281
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,810
Listen, I have somebody in the car
who's late for a plane.

282
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,190
- Can you give me two minutes?
- Mom--

283
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,500
I am so disappointed in you.

284
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,960
- Hello, Carolyn.
- Yeah, hey, how are ya?

285
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,800
Look, make him work it off.
You get a free stock boy for a month.

286
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,420
A month?
It was a $10 bottle of whiskey.

287
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,550
Exactly. You weren't even smart enough
to steal the good stuff.

288
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,390
Harvey, don't walk away.

289
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,580
Come on.
Let's sort this out.

290
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,690
Hey, Nora.
How's tricks?

291
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,840
I thought it was your car I saw in the lot.

292
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,420
You're a conniving bitch.

293
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,370
Ah, I see you've heard from our lawyer.

294
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,150
So it's not enough that you run me out of town.

295
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,470
You gotta steal my damn kid.

296
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,070
Carolyn, what are you doing here?

297
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,270
I've been thinking, Harvey,
that if you loved this Monique woman so much...

298
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,970
Even you have to admit Kayla would be better off

299
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,620
with us than in a dingy apartment
over a Tijuana strip club.

300
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,520
Believe me, Lynette, you do not
wanna screw with me.

301
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,870
You went after my husband.
If anye should be afraid, it's you.

302
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,480
Go!

303
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,870
Go!

304
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,510
Harvey!

305
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,040
Harvey, you come out of there, damn it!

306
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,670
Down.
Everybody down.

307
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,580
Nobody goes anywhere.

308
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,880
don't move.
Get down.

309
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,610
You can't be serious.
We have tickets.

310
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,540
The plane leaves in two hours.

311
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,630
I'm sorry.
I know, Julie picked a lousy time to rebel.

312
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,230
I'm...
I just can't fly off and ignore it.

313
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,720
You're overreacting.
It's an adolescent prank,

314
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,170
and you're turning it into some
great bloody crisis.

315
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,530
You have a lot of meetings anyway.
Wel go some other time.

316
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,690
I can't leave Julie right now.

317
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,300
We'll take her with us.

318
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,310
Oh, that's responsible parenting.
Stealing whiskey?

319
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,550
"That's it, young lady.
I'm taking you to Paris.¡±

320
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,120
Ah, ah, but that's just some ruse.

321
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,940
Once we get her on the plane, we'll make
her fly coach--middle seat, no mercy.

322
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,530
I'm sorry.

323
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,350
It won't be Paris without you.

324
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,050
Hey.
What the hell's going on?

325
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,920
It's Mrs. Bigsby.
She has a gun.

326
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,120
What?

327
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,290
I said nobody move!

328
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,130
She's at the back.

329
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,530
I think we can make it.

330
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,480
Hey!

331
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,910
Attention, shoppers, wee having
a special today on not getting shot,

332
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,230
but it's only available at the
back of the store!

333
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,460
Hey, how are ya?

334
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,270
Thanks for joining us.
Do I know you?

335
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,300
My son Jordan's in your sunday school class.

336
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,610
Oh, he's a great little boy, so don't do anything
that'll make him wake up tomorrow without a mommy.

337
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,620
Um, for the rest of you, hi, I'm Carolyn.

338
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,520
I'm sorry for putting a crimp in your y,

339
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,750
but I'm pretty sure that my cheating husband
is in re right now phoning the police,

340
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,640
so I'm counting on all you folks to help me keep
them outside till Harvey and I have a chance to...

341
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,180
Talk things over.

342
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,420
Harvey!

343
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,010
You're inconveniencing your customers.

344
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,640
Get out here!

345
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,700
Yeah, she's got hostages!

346
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,050
Oh, my God.

347
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,400
Austin's there, and Julie!

348
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,560
Get your ass out there before someone gets hurt!

349
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,850
What am I, a moron? She'll shoot me.

350
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,950
She has got ten innocent people out there.

351
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,160
Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.

352
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,360
Sweetie, it's mommy. I need to talk to daddy.

353
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,450
Porter's hogging all the legos.

354
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,990
Tell 'em I said to share. Now put Daddy on.

355
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,710
I did tell them, but he says he needs them all for his robot.

356
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,600
Put Daddy on, and I'll buy you a real robot.

357
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,750
You will?

358
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,760
A big one with laser beam eyes. Now go get Daddy!

359
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,590
I'm getting a real robot!

360
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,530
A real robot? Come on, that's not fair.

361
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm having a real bad day here.

362
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,530
Is a little cooperation too much to ask?

363
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,690
Lynette? Lynette?

364
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,300
It's terrible.

365
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,320
Excuse me, what's going-- what's going on?

366
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,480
Crazy woman with a gun! In there!

367
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,690
no, no, no! Stay back!

368
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,220
Carolyn! Open up! My daughter's inside!

369
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,390
Sorry, store's closed.

370
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,180
Yeah, but there's a crazy woman in there!

371
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,270
Yeah, I know.

372
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,080
Quick, turn on the TV.

373
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,890
It's kinda on the fritz.

374
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,700
Well, turn on your radio.

375
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,160
If only you'd come ten minutes earlier.

376
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,280
Some woman is shooting up fields market.
She's got hostages.

377
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,330
Oh, my God!

378
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah, we're all watching it over at Bree's house, and...

379
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,630
Uh, is everything okay here?

380
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,240
Yeah, everything's fine. Having a little squabble.

381
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,230
Give us a minute.

382
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,570
Carlos, where do you think you're going with that?!

383
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,210
Information is very thin at this time.

384
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,170
We do not see anybody in the front
of the building at this hour...

385
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,260
Coffee's almost ready, and if you'd prefer to
watch the coverage on channel 9, it's on in the den.

386
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,220
Orson, greta needs a coaster.

387
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,010
Bree, have you heard?

388
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,910
Oh, it's just awful. Deviled egg?

389
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,370
Oh, thank you.

390
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,680
I told you she'd have food.

391
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm sure some of you might be
thinking that this is all my fault

392
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,880
and that I'm the bad guy here,
but I'm not. He is.

393
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,930
Will you people stop calling me?
I'm right in the middle of something.

394
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,170
He humiliated me.

395
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,330
First he cheated on me with
a stewardess named Monique.

396
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,390
How cliché is that?

397
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,060
And then he told people about it.

398
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,530
Now there are news trucks out there.

399
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,200
Judy Pope's husband has an affair
nobody finds out.

400
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,870
Mine cheats, and they break into programming!

401
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,090
The whole town is laughing at me!
You hear that, Harvey?

402
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,830
I only told one person.

403
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,140
Well, it was clearly the wrong one.

404
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,030
I told you to stop calling me--

405
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,990
Tish, I'm sorry. I thought it was somebody else.

406
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,480
Oh, my God, was that today? I'm so sorry.

407
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,580
I know, Tish. Yeah, I know.

408
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,270
I know I volunteered for the winter fair...

409
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,410
How can you look so calm?

410
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,240
Aren't you scared?

411
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,740
No, because I'm not gonna die today...

412
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,840
and neither are you.

413
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,460
Tish, I really don't think that I can.

414
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,410
I'm telling you, um...

415
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,980
oh, Tish, for God sakes, turn on your damn tv!

416
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,390
Excuse me, my name is Susan Mayer--

417
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,040
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.

418
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,650
I would like to trade places
with one of the people inside.

419
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,560
Don't-- don't you do that?

420
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,580
Oh, you mean our hostage exchange program?

421
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,220
Okay, you don't have to be nasty.
My daughter is inside there.

422
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,870
Ma'am, we're doing everything
we can to get her out safely.

423
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,750
Now please step back.

424
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,870
I want the perimeter locked down.
Nobody goes in, nobody goes out,

425
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
and see if you can get me an open
phone line with the manager's office.

426
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,290
attention! Attention, Carolyn Bigsby!

427
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,920
Where's that coming from?

428
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,930
This is Susan Mayer... again.

429
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,840
First of all, I'm sorry for the "crazy lady" remark.

430
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,380
Second, I have a proposition for you.

431
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,710
Find her now!

432
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,560
Let Julie go and take me instead.

433
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,960
Repeat, take me.

434
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,820
I will be a model hostage.

435
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,590
If we have a deal, signal by sending
Julie to the--no, take your hands off me!

436
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,390
Carolyn, Carolyn! Call my cell! It's 572--

437
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,250
Now we don't know where anyone
is inside the building right now,

438
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,360
but we are standing by, waiting for information.

439
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,250
I'm hoping to talk to the chief of police in
just a couple of minutes, get a few more details...

440
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,750
Andrew, honey, would you please get the phone?

441
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,050
Police have just released the
name of the hostage taker.

442
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,600
It's Carolyn Bigsby, wife of
store owner Harvey Bigsby.

443
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,330
Harvey has informed police that he
is barricaded inside the store...

444
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,900
Oh, my God, Bree, don't you know her?

445
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,200
Uh, yes, um...

446
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,010
I just... ran into her this morning.

447
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,400
uh, Mom?

448
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,340
That was Edie Britt on the phone.

449
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,520
She's inside the market.

450
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,210
is she all right?

451
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,900
Yeah, uh, she's locked inside the manager's office,

452
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:15,290
but she said that Julie Mayer and Mrs. Scavo 
are with the hostages.

453
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,510
Bree, would you mind watching the kids?
I've got a doctor's appointment,

454
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,950
and Lynette is taking her sweet time at the market.

455
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm sorry. Are you guys having a party?

456
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:43,880
We continue to report live on the scene as the
hostage standoff at fields market enters its third hour.

457
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,290
According to a police spokesman,

458
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,580
there has been no further contact from the hostage taker.

459
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,770
We continue to wait for the latest information.

460
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,320
No new news at this point.

461
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,730
We will bring you the latest as
soon as it becomes available.

462
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,580
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

463
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,100
I just, I'm running out of food,
and it's not as if I can go to the ocery store.

464
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,850
Bree...

465
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,410
Thank God I found this stale
baguette so I can make bruschetta,

466
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,060
and there's shrimp in the freezer,

467
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,560
so I'm gonna make my rice and seafood dish

468
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,860
Bree, this is not your fault.

469
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,360
I had to tell her.

470
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,360
She hurt me, so I hurt her back.

471
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,200
If anything should happen to Julie or Lynette...

472
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,580
Is there anything I can do?

473
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,010
You can peel a clove of garlic.

474
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,640
Okay.

475
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,840
I wanted kids.

476
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,740
I wanted kids so badly, but Harvey
had two from his first wife.

477
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,590
He said it made her fat.

478
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,360
Harvey likes them lean.

479
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,990
I run 4 miles a day.

480
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,890
This is my first cookie in six years.
You hear that, Harvey?

481
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,300
I'm breaking my diet!

482
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,890
She's starting to lose it out there.
What do I do?

483
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,270
Just keep her calm, tell her you're sorry

484
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,590
and see if you can get her to
release the kids and old people.

485
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,200
Okay, I'll try.

486
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,480
Carolyn...

487
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,020
Honey... uh, it's me, Harvey.

488
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,050
Look, I'm really sorry.

489
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,700
What I did... was wrong,

490
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,370
but I still love you a lot.

491
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,810
Cut the crap.

492
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,890
I had my hair done this morning.
Did you notice?

493
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,860
- Did you even notice?
- Well, I was distracted.

494
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,070
You were shooting at me.

495
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,590
Tell her... let the kids go.

496
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,170
Who the hell was that?!

497
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,520
You got a woman in there?

498
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,360
She's a customer!

499
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,390
Don't lie to me, Harvey!

500
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,340
She's another one of your whores, isn't she?

501
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,820
Oh, fantastic!

502
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,690
Carolyn, I swear--

503
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,190
Shut up.

504
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,060
I hope you're having a good time in there, whore,

505
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,920
'cause I got a bullet for you, too.

506
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,800
God, what a nightmare.

507
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,200
You know what the weird part is?

508
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,670
What?

509
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,140
I keep thinking about that
crazy lady in the market,

510
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,460
and.. I understand her.

511
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,940
I-I could be her.

512
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,210
Come on.

513
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,110
No, I mean it.

514
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,520
The rage that I have felt
in these past six months...

515
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,210
if I had had a gun in the courthouse today...

516
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,330
you could never shoot me.

517
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,470
I don't know what I'm capable of anymore.

518
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,490
This divorce has turned me into this...

519
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,450
bitter, hateful person, and I don't like her.

520
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,530
Hey, baby.

521
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,450
And for what it's worth, I don't like
what it's turned you into either.

522
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,930
Then let's stop being those people.

523
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,750
Okay.

524
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,900
Okay.

525
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,690
Hey, just so you know...

526
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,620
I heard the woman in there teaches sunday school.

527
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,590
A sunday school teacher would never hurt a kid.

528
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,680
No way.

529
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,330
Thank you.

530
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,910
I'm sure Lynette's gonna be fine, too.

531
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,990
Oh, I'm not worried about Lynette.

532
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,300
Hell, with Lynette in there,
they don't even need that negotiator.

533
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,940
You put Lynette in a room with a
woman who wants to shoot her husband,

534
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,880
she'll have them renewing their vows.

535
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,660
Right, Lynette is very persuasive.

536
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,250
I give it an hour, tops.

537
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,450
Then we'll all be back home eating our hamburgers.

538
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:36,940
She was gonna go to the store tomorrow,
but we were out of hamburger.

539
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,320
I wanted hamburgers.

540
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,300
I hope all this is giving you a
little perspective on our situation.

541
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,680
She told us not to talk.

542
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,090
You're thinking about your kids, right?

543
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,300
How awful it'd be to never see them again.

544
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,930
Well, that's what you're asking me to feel,
but for the rest of my life!

545
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,520
Nora, please!

546
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,620
Hey, what'd I say?

547
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,680
sorry. I'm sorry. We'll-- we'll be quiet.

548
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,140
You and your friend are really startinto bug me.

549
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,980
She's not my friend.

550
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:24,120
- She's trying to steal my kid.
- Nora, shut up!

551
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,130
Is that true?

552
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,470
No! I-- we're--

553
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,920
We're sharing custody, and then she
tried to seduce my husband, so

554
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,920
she put the moves on your husband?

555
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,400
Why didn't you say so?

556
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,110
That was a shot! We just heard a
shot fired inside the building.

557
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,570
A shot has been fired.

558
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,980
I believe the phrase you're looking for is <i>thank you.</i>

559
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,410
We just had a shot. We heard a
shot fired inside the market.

560
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,860
You can see police are responding,
taking this very seriously.

561
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:19,560
We are going to just continue to stand
and watch and wait and see what happens.

562
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,370
It was on television at the airport.
I came as soon as I could.

563
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,590
The last thing I said to her
was that she disappointed me.

564
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,890
Police have just confirmed
that a hostage has been shot.

565
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,920
Repeat, a hostage has been shot.

566
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,520
There's no word on the name of the victim
at this time, but it is believed to be female.

567
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,150
Mrs. Hodge?

568
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,390
when's Mommy gonna be back from the store?

569
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,510
I'm sure she'll be back soon.
Why don't we, uh, go have some cookies?

570
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,240
Mommy said we can't have cookies before dinner.

571
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,280
I'm sure she won't mind. Come on.

572
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,720
Let's go. Come on.

573
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,870
Okay, I gotta keep the pressure up to stop the bleeding!

574
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,000
good news is you won't need that lawyer now.

575
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,210
You are gonna get through this just fine.

576
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,330
There is a parking lot full of ambulances out there.

577
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,170
You gotta let us take her out of here!

578
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,870
No one's leaving.

579
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,570
Listen to me... Lynette...

580
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,580
about Kayla--

581
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,810
Oh, forget it! Forget it! We'll work that out later.

582
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,710
No!

583
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,970
I don't have-- have later, you stupid bitch.

584
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
Okay? So listen.

585
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,650
Okay, I'm listening.

586
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:52,710
Kayla's the only good thing that
I've ever done in my whollife.

587
00:36:53,870 --> 00:37:00,720
I need you to really take
really good care... of her.

588
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,370
Okay?

589
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,710
I don't have all day. Come on.

590
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,450
Yeah, yes, I will, I will, I will.

591
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,190
I will love her like she is my own.

592
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,060
I will, Nora. Nora?

593
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,990
Nora!

594
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,740
Lynette sobbing oh, don't look at me that way.
You know you wanted her dead.

595
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,850
How can you say that?

596
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,940
Well, you told me about her and your husband after
I made it pretty clear where I stand on whores.

597
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,750
I did not want this.

598
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,210
Don't you dare say that I wanted this.

599
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,770
- Shut up!
- No, I will not shut up!

600
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,320
What's the matter with you?!

601
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,740
Have you not been paying attention?
My husband cheated on me!

602
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,240
Who cares?! Who cares? We all have pain!

603
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,050
Everyone in here has pain, but we deal with it!

604
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,170
We swallow it and get going with our lives!

605
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,910
What we don't do is go around shooting strangers!

606
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,850
She deserved it!

607
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,800
Well, maybe you deserved to be cheated on!

608
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,910
I'm.. I'm... I'm sorry.

609
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,460
I-I shouldn't have said that.

610
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah, you shouldn't have.

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,360
<i>Lynette scavo had a dream that night.

614
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,480
<i>It was one she'd had many times before.

615
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,410
Hey! Mary Alice, are you okay?

616
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,940
Yes, thank you.

617
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,590
I'm fine.

618
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,640
Okay. I'll see you later.

619
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,600
<i>But this night, something changed.

620
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,760
No, you're not. I can tell.

621
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:16,650
Please... tell me what's wrong.

622
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,770
Let me save you.

623
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,530
You can't.

624
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,030
Why not?

625
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,290
Sweetie, we can't prevent what we can't predict.

626
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,370
Isn't there anything I can do?

627
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,930
Yes.

628
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,520
You can enjoy this beautiful day.

629
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,720
We get so few of them.

630
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:07,610
<i>This was the last time Lynette would ever dream of me,

631
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,580
<i>and for her sake, I'm grateful.
