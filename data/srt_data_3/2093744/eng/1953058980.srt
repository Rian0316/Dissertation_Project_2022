What the hell?

21
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:22,774
Shh!

22
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:24,343
Get up.

23
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:26,178
Get up.

24
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:28,014
It's 1:00 a.m.

25
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:29,281
Come on. Hop to it.

26
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,961
Carl's awake.

27
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:42,596
I'll get Debbie.

28
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:54,074
Come on.

29
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:55,909
Is that our Halloween candy?

30
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:57,244
Who wants candy corn?

31
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,312
Me.

32
00:01:58,347 --> 00:01:59,547
Movie night.

33
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:00,615
We have school in the morning.

34
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:02,083
<i>Paranormal Activity 3.</i>

35
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:03,318
Right?

36
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:05,654
My buddy Edgar shot
this at the AMC.

37
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:10,560
Ooh.

38
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:11,795
Why is the camera so shaky?

39
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,631
Ah, Edgar's got palsy.

40
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,832
It's rated "R."

41
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,168
For "really
fucking scary."

42
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:19,837
So sit there and learn.

43
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:21,004
I'm gonna get Fiona.

44
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,806
She wouldn't like this movie.

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,575
This is gonna be
our little secret.

46
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:26,343
Hmm.

47
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,349
Die.

48
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:33,251
Ooh.

49
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:34,952
Don't go there.

50
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,769
I'd trade my left nut for
one more hour of sleep.

51
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,938
- You're gonna be late for school.
- Hey,

52
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:53,040
I hope you're hungry--
most important meal

53
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,642
of the day.

54
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:55,843
Carl,

55
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:57,445
sit.

56
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,179
House could use a spring clean.

57
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:00,714
It's November.

58
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:01,716
It's like <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> in here.

59
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,051
What's with you guys?

60
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:04,953
Debbie, can you get
your father up?

61
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:07,022
He's out in the alley by
the Chopiaks' garbage cans.

62
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,524
Help him to bed.

63
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,327
Ian left for work early.

64
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:12,829
Did you hear,
I kicked Terry Milkovich's ass?

65
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:14,030
Not the first time

66
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:15,999
someone's come in here
fists first.

67
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,134
Why don't you go for a run?

68
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:18,302
When's the last
time you did that?

69
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:19,970
Got too much to do.

70
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:21,305
Like?

71
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,740
Uh, make lunches,
get Liam dressed,

72
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:24,075
take him for his checkup.

73
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,477
Made lunches already.

74
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,079
I'm here.

75
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:28,547
Doesn't all have
to fall on you.

76
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:29,582
I'm doing better,

77
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,417
I promise.

78
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:33,052
Carl.

79
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:34,420
Carl Gallagher.

80
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:37,589
Okay, if you're not
going to eat,

81
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:40,091
I want your teeth
brushed in two minutes.

82
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:41,559
Come on, wear this.

83
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:43,727
- You Febreze it first?
- Washed it last night.

84
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,496
Why don't you go for a run?

85
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,665
I remember

86
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,001
when you used to run six miles
before school every morning.

87
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,405
She did.

88
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,507
Steve, is Lip okay?

89
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,242
Got great news.
Can I come over?

90
00:03:58,276 --> 00:03:59,376
No.

91
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,078
I'm right outside the house.

92
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:02,747
Of course you are.

93
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:09,522
My wife is in love
with another guy.

94
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:12,258
- Congratulations?
- Marco.

95
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm importing him to the States,
I'm gonna surprise her.

96
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,929
Yeah, what's her dad
got to say about it?

97
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,864
Nothing can stand
in the way of true love.

98
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,766
He finds out,
you're going to be Hoffa'd.

99
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,801
He'll remain blissfully
in the dark down in Rio.

100
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,769
Can I come in?

101
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,571
- 'Cause we got nothing else to work out.
- Like what?

102
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,707
Like you still being married
and harboring my brother?

103
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:28,808
He's a truant, not a terrorist.

104
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:30,643
Come on, Dad.

105
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:31,878
Morning, Debs.

106
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:33,279
Bring any coffee?

107
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:35,281
- Hmm, sorry.
- Step up.

108
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,054
Wife's boyfriend ain't here yet.

109
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,758
So when he gets in, so do I?

110
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,926
Deal.

111
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:46,927
Don't make plans tonight.

112
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:47,929
I'm picking him up right now.

113
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:50,165
I never said "Deal."

114
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,344
All right, Mandy, third try.

115
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:03,246
Look, I'm really bad
at taking hints,

116
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:06,350
so I'll hit double digits
if you don't call me back.

117
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,386
Look, I need you to get
your dad to back off.

118
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,339
Coming!

119
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:34,779
Package.

120
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,514
Signed for it.

121
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:40,484
Oh, oh, y-you don't
have to get my mail.

122
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,354
Oh, i-i-it's
the body pillow.

123
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:47,859
I, I, I ordered it for Karen.

124
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,294
Butane?

125
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,696
Crème brûlée.

126
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,531
Father Pete's bringing
a guest over.

127
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,400
Hospice?

128
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:58,770
Poor guy's been living
in the church basement.

129
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,375
You, uh... need a hand
bringing the bed down?

130
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,244
Oh, no, no, no. I
can, I can do it.

131
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:09,413
I can help.

132
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:12,983
No, no, no, no, no.

133
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,242
Fuck.

134
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:39,576
Hey.

135
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:40,878
The skinheads again?

136
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:44,381
Mandy's dad heard the news.

137
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,782
You and Mickey?

138
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:48,786
Mandy-- pregnant.

139
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,356
Oh.

140
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,857
Well, congratulations.

141
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:55,626
- I didn't know you switched teams.
- Yeah.

142
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,361
Or was it
just a late night--

143
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:58,863
- stuck it in the wrong Milkovich?
- He told Linda

144
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:01,098
he's gonna put my feet
in that meat slicer,

145
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:02,465
work his way up.

146
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,867
Linda call the cops?

147
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:04,901
Think she wants the
place firebombed?

148
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:07,269
Huh.

149
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,771
Mandy say whose it is?

150
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,640
Won't call me back.

151
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:15,945
Try checking the school.

152
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,813
Yeah, Linda assured me that
if I leave the place how it is,

153
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,315
then I'm gonna be out of a job,

154
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:20,550
and anyway, she's not going
to be there.

155
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,551
She usually goes into hiding

156
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,486
until her dad cools off.

157
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,121
Spider hole in Tikrit?

158
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,656
Relatives on South Justine.

159
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:28,957
Went by, but

160
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:30,559
her aunt wouldn't let me in.

161
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:31,827
How's the homeless shelter?

162
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:34,663
On the 14th floor of
the Ritz, so not bad.

163
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:35,765
Staying with Steve.

164
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,500
Great view.

165
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:40,304
- Skyline?
- That, too.

166
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,174
Ah, right, Steve's wife.

167
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,510
Surprised you can
still lift that arm.

168
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:48,114
That's gonna come
out of my pay.

169
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,949
Relax.

170
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:52,652
Got to go meet Steve.

171
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:53,986
Try not to knock up

172
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:56,422
any more chicks while
I'm gone, all right?

173
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:02,428
Steve's flying in
the wife's boyfriend?

174
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:04,831
Can't say he hasn't been
working his elfin ass off,

175
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,165
trying to win you back.

176
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,500
Holy shit, bury the lead.

177
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:09,668
Something you want to tell me?

178
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:10,836
My morning ritual--

179
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,371
get mounted by Kev,
pee on a stick.

180
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:13,505
He won't leave
for work without it.

181
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,507
- Weeks now.
- Jesus, these things

182
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:16,975
- are expensive.
- Tell me about it.

183
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,344
Thought anything involving
his dick and my honeypot

184
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,479
would be the easy part.

185
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,047
You worried?

186
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:24,316
Thought Kev had defective balls,

187
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,185
but he got it checked out.

188
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:28,154
Little swimmers could qualify
for the Junior Olympics.

189
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:30,056
When was the last
time <i>you</i> spread 'em?

190
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,023
For a doctor?

191
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:32,024
Been forever.

192
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:33,659
Couldn't be me.

193
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:37,695
I've had so many abortions,
the next one's free.

194
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,364
Isn't there a neglected child
that needs you somewhere?

195
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:41,332
Thinking about
taking the day off.

196
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,133
Who's running the asylum?

197
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,402
Monica.

198
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:47,070
Seems like she's doing better.

199
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:48,705
Taking her meds?

200
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:49,972
She says so.

201
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,340
I know it's not gonna last,

202
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:53,209
but maybe I can get
a few good months

203
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:54,977
- before she crashes.
- You should go see Meg.

204
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,746
Down at the club?

205
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,848
Didn't she say she had
something for you--

206
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:00,049
a regular job?

207
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,151
Yeah.

208
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:06,022
That lady doctor still at
the clinic-- Sausage Fingers?

209
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:12,695
Liam,

210
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,665
you did such a great job
with your... shot.

211
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,333
What did I promise?

212
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:20,502
Brave boys...

213
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:23,404
...get a sucker.

214
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,273
Frank!

215
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:26,741
I'm back!

216
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,209
You up?

217
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,544
How about pancakes?

218
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:32,079
Hungry?

219
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:41,156
"Squirrel fund"?

220
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:59,342
Hello...

221
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:08,652
- Frank.
- I don't give a shit

222
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,787
what you make for breakfast.

223
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:11,989
Ow!

224
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,891
What the fuck, Monica!

225
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,760
What? Where the hell
did you get all that?

226
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:18,995
I found it.

227
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,166
Thinking we could pay
a visit to Raoul.

228
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,500
Snort or swallow?

229
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:25,169
Both!

230
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:31,409
Oh, nine, four,
three-eight...

231
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:32,844
So, when was Marco
supposed to arrive?

232
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,345
Should be here by now.

233
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,648
Oh, nine, four, three,
eight, four... four, one, six.

234
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,784
There's got to be an easier way
to smuggle him in.

235
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,319
A billion Chinese
can't be wrong.

236
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:43,021
Man, how long
is this gonna take?

237
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:44,822
Really? Is there
somewhere you need to be?

238
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,257
Yeah, Ian's in some trouble.

239
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,858
Here. Thought you wanted this.

240
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:49,326
Quickest grand you ever made.

241
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,127
What's that,
for the phone hacking?

242
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,663
Oh, buyer was thrilled, said you
should moonlight for the NSA.

243
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,032
Use it as a down payment
on your own place.

244
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,368
Why do that when I could have
a rich father-in-law

245
00:10:58,402 --> 00:10:59,702
to leech off of like you?

246
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,204
Seriously,

247
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,373
you want to be on your own,
you got to start saving.

248
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:06,177
Ricky, there's no more
containers in this aisle.

249
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,279
10,000 easy get lost
at sea every year.

250
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:10,882
Well, is it possible
the container could have got put

251
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,451
in a different lane?

252
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:14,685
Let me see that?

253
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:20,056
Yo, Steve, you sure
these are fours?

254
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,324
They look like nines.

255
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:22,892
Yo, Marco, bit of a problem.

256
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:26,195
Uh, you want to call me back
when you get this?

257
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,070
Marco!
Marco!

258
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:36,538
Yo, Marco!

259
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,139
Marco!

260
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:39,975
Marco!

261
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,476
Marco!

262
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,381
Fucking Raoul.

263
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,516
12 hundred dollars
for an ounce of coke.

264
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,818
- For his shitty coke?
- Yeah.

265
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:53,187
It's like Drano
going up your nose.

266
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:54,822
Offered it for
$1,150 if I blew him.

267
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:56,857
What else... What else
did you get?

268
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,926
Oh.

269
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:02,562
Wheels?

270
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,198
It took six security guards

271
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,000
to kick us out of there.

272
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,402
It took three just to climb
over the rail and get you

273
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,737
away from that zebra.

274
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,438
I thought it was a unicorn.

275
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:14,908
I swear, I saw a...
What were we on?

276
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,843
Hit me.

277
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:18,878
Oxy or... Bennie?

278
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,179
- Bennie.
- Bennie?

279
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:21,347
There you go.

280
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,382
Why anyone

281
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,617
- would go to the zoo sober...
- Hey.

282
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:28,053
You having fun back there?

283
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:30,388
Where's the Special K?

284
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:32,190
- I skipped it.
- Skipped... Why?

285
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:35,027
If I wanted to feel dead,
I would take my meds.

286
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:35,728
It was the one thing

287
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:36,962
I asked for!

288
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,931
You selfish bitch!

289
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,932
God...

290
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,034
Stop the car!

291
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:42,602
You're fucking driving!

292
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,205
- Get out!
- No!

293
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,274
Then I'm fucking getting out!

294
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,609
This is just like you!

295
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,711
Excuse me for fucking sharing!

296
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:52,213
Always your conditions!

297
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:53,580
I had to deal with Raoul.

298
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:55,115
Oh, there it is.

299
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,650
Trying to cut my nuts off.

300
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:58,385
No! Don't you talk
about cutting!

301
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,821
Not my fault your parents
did a number on you.

302
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:03,157
Oh, like the psychotic bitch
who raised you

303
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:05,125
- was Mother of the Year!
- May that psychotic bitch rest in peace!

304
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,959
Fuck you!

305
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,828
Oh, yeah?
Well... fuck you!

306
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:17,906
Wait. Where you going?

307
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,810
Monica?

308
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:27,356
Monica?! Fuck! Christ!

309
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,500
Get the fuck back, Terry.

310
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,102
I've got a shotgun!

311
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,636
Not Terry.

312
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,440
Fuck you want?

313
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,343
Hi. I'm-I'm...

314
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,777
I'm Lip, Mandy's friend.

315
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:58,846
- Mandy ain't here.
- Oh, yeah.

316
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,048
I-I need to talk to her.

317
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:02,050
No visitors.

318
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,552
Could you just go inside

319
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:05,520
- and tell her it's me?
- Could you step back

320
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:08,957
before I spray your organs
all over my goddamn yard?

321
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:13,228
Now, fuck off!

322
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,305
Mandy?

323
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,475
Look, you got to call
your dad off, all right?

324
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,910
Get him to leave Ian alone!

325
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,981
Just.

326
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:34,683
Tell him the truth,

327
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,417
you know, even if it mine.

328
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:38,386
If your dad needs
to kill someone,

329
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,021
tell him he can come after me!

330
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,032
I thought you had kids

331
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:51,167
- to take care of.
- The situation changed.

332
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,570
Oh, I wish it had changed
before I hired someone else.

333
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:56,206
Got to give them the
spiel. Hey, no nips,

334
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,842
no lips, no handies.
This isn't a strip club.

335
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,243
You still opening
that new place?

336
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:01,744
Belle Epoque.
More Gucci,

337
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:03,179
less Axe Body Spray.

338
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:04,714
- Is there anything for me there?
- I wish.

339
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,683
I can do more than waitress.
I've bartended.

340
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:08,084
We're staffed up.

341
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:09,519
Completely?

342
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,288
Just need someone
to run the upper bar.

343
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:12,722
Well, I can do that.

344
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:14,358
Looking for someone who
can promote a night.

345
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:15,760
Well, I'm getting my GED.

346
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:17,228
Look, no one's gonna pay

347
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:19,464
1,000 bucks for a
$20 bottle of vodka

348
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,033
unless the service
is impeccable.

349
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:24,203
You ever managed? Overseen
inventory, budgeting?

350
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:28,541
Look, I got too much
on my plate to baby-sit.

351
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,376
- Sorry.
- Worth a shot.

352
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:32,412
Thanks.

353
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:44,423
Deb? Debbie?

354
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,892
Hi. How was school today?

355
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,328
Who'd you steal it from?

356
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:51,763
We bought it.

357
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:52,964
Come on, get in!

358
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,200
Now!

359
00:15:56,436 --> 00:16:00,072
Come on!

360
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,673
Where's Frank?

361
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,408
Do you want to go shopping?

362
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:06,444
Oh, pretty girls day out!

363
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:07,846
Sure.
Come on, let's go.

364
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,148
Whoa!

365
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:12,150
I got it.

366
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,532
Come on!

367
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,378
Fucking NAFTA!

368
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:43,447
Ah...

369
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:44,515
No.

370
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,519
No. No.

371
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:52,490
No.

372
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:58,529
Ooh!

373
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,300
Marco?

374
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,235
Where the fuck am I?!

375
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:10,774
I've been trying to reach you.

376
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:16,413
Take small breaths.

377
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:18,248
Have anydea where you are?
Can you hear anything?

378
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:22,719
I'm trying my best, Marco.

379
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:24,154
Okay? Ration your food,

380
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:25,822
like those Chilean miners.

381
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:27,657
Only needed a couple bites
of tuna a day to survive.

382
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:29,058
Hey, beautiful.

383
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:30,894
Don't pass that one
up right there.

384
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:32,996
Do a twirl.

385
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,064
No.

386
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,867
Hello. Marco?

387
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:37,734
Hey.

388
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:41,372
Oh.

389
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,976
Surprise.

390
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,934
- Sheila, Ruben.
- Oh.

391
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:12,570
- Got shot by his pimp.
- Ooh.

392
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:16,140
- Infection in his spine.
- Oh.

393
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:17,808
- Hi.
- Oh, he can't hear you.

394
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:19,710
- Oh.
- Deaf since birth.

395
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,912
Says that's why he started
sucking a crack pipe.

396
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:25,282
I'm proud to say young Ruben's
come to see the Lord does not

397
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,585
accept excuses in
exchange for first-class

398
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,220
transportation upstairs.

399
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:30,554
Been clean a year now.

400
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:33,091
- Father, just a moment, please?
- Of course.

401
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,060
He came to us three years ago

402
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,296
during one of our winter
nights for the homeless.

403
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,831
- Yeah. - Hung on a lot longer
than any of us expected.

404
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,133
Saints be praised.

405
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,568
No, that wasn't what I...

406
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:45,902
Weust can't afford
to keep him any longer.

407
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:47,504
- Oh.
- State cutbacks.

408
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:49,572
You'll receive
$50 a day for food

409
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:52,642
and whatever else he needs,
but let's just say,

410
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:55,345
I'm not going to be making
any surprise visits.

411
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:58,248
Father, I've...

412
00:18:58,283 --> 00:19:02,319
I've... done a
terrible thing.

413
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:06,591
I don't...
recognize myself anymore.

414
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,992
When I look in the mirror,

415
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,827
it's like another...

416
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,996
person is staring back at me,
and I'm...

417
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,431
I'm just...

418
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,834
I'm lost.

419
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:21,638
Your purpose in life was
to build a happy family,

420
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:23,139
and you achieved that.

421
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,041
And now, your husband's passed,

422
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:27,276
and your daughter's
ready to fly the nest,

423
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,712
but you're still needed.

424
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:32,948
This is your purpose now.

425
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,661
Hi, Ruben.

426
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:49,132
I'm Sheila.

427
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:56,239
Okay, great.

428
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:59,042
Yeah, this will be great.

429
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,570
Hey, sweetheart,
is everything okay?

430
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:28,106
Mandy's dad came looking for me
at school.

431
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:29,508
Are you all right?

432
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,510
Managed to duck out
before he saw me.

433
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:34,613
What's with the dolls?

434
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,614
Took Debbie shopping;
I missed her last birthday.

435
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,351
And we couldn't decide which
doll to get, so we got them all!

436
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:41,720
I'll get the other load.
There's more?

437
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:44,222
Didn't have
the heart to tell her,

438
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,791
I don't play
with dolls anymore.

439
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:48,293
She practically filled the car.

440
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,728
Car?

441
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:52,297
- You bought a car?
- Hey, how was

442
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:53,732
your trigonometry midterm?

443
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,637
C-minus.

444
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:02,308
Great, you passed!

445
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:03,743
I can kiss West
Point good-bye.

446
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:04,810
West Point?

447
00:21:04,845 --> 00:21:06,078
I was hoping to get in,

448
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:07,646
not that I'll live
long enough now to go.

449
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:11,383
Well, if you know
you want to be in the Army,

450
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,386
why are you wasting
your time with school?

451
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,520
Join up.

452
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,822
What are we waiting for?

453
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:18,824
Happy birthday.

454
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,560
Come on, let's go.

455
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,401
The ship's called the <i>Bonita.</i>

456
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:29,669
It's based out of Mexico.

457
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:31,071
- Lip?
- Yup?

458
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:33,440
- Focus.
- I am focusing on the nude woman

459
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:35,442
getting a spray tan
in your bedroom.

460
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:37,010
She's trying to lose
her tan lines

461
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,779
- before Marco gets here.
- It's a noble endeavor

462
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:40,514
- I fully endorse.
- And a complete waste

463
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:41,781
of time if we do not track

464
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:43,416
down Marco's ship and find out

465
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,350
where he is; he is

466
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:45,785
calling me in four hours.

467
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,820
I need to give him good news.

468
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:49,789
What, you didn't telt her
we lost him?

469
00:21:49,823 --> 00:21:52,157
No.

470
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:54,860
Well, it would be a shame
if he didn't make it,

471
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:57,329
but, you know,
naturally, I'd step up,

472
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:59,264
- be there to comfort her.
- All right,

473
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:00,799
cut the shit, Lip;
I lose Marco,

474
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,434
I lose Fiona.

475
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:03,535
Okay, okay, okay.

476
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:06,037
Um...

477
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,542
All right, so the ship

478
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:12,545
- should be stopping to pick up extra cargo.
- Where is it?

479
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:15,381
Uh, be in Cleveland tonight.
Cleveland! Cleveland?

480
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:18,150
Yeah, so take him to the Rock
'n Roll Hall of Fame, but now,

481
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:20,219
do me a favor,
get the fuck out of my way?

482
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:23,923
Thank you.

483
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,298
Ever been outside of Chicago?

484
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,300
Army sent me all
over the world.

485
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:37,069
I ate a croissant

486
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:39,238
outside the Eiffel Tower
and pizza in Rome.

487
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:41,240
So the other branches
are here, too, huh?

488
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:42,842
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,343
And we'll train you, too,

490
00:22:44,378 --> 00:22:45,678
so when you finish
your service,

491
00:22:45,713 --> 00:22:47,981
you can secure a
good-paying job back home.

492
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:49,483
So, what're they playing?
That looks fun.

493
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:51,919
America's Army 3.

494
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,587
We could use more

495
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:54,855
bright, young men like you.

496
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:56,757
How soon can I ship out?

497
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,425
Okay.

498
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,260
So,

499
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:02,162
U.S. citizen, right?

500
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:04,030
- Ever been convicted of a crime?
- Uh, no, sir.

501
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:05,699
What year you graduate?

502
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:08,335
I'm a junior.

503
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:09,769
In high school?

504
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,941
Gonna have to come and see me
when you got your diploma.

505
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,175
What?

506
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,510
You're turning him down?

507
00:23:17,544 --> 00:23:19,012
He needs to be a
high school graduate.

508
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:21,681
- Why?
- The rules, ma'am, I'm sorry.

509
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:23,883
- Fuck the rules. Sign him up.
- Ma'am, I'm sorry, but it's really....

510
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:27,887
He wants to serve his country!

511
00:23:29,823 --> 00:23:31,524
Finish school.

512
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,393
- Let's stay in touch.
- Since when do you have to know

513
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:35,296
trigonometry to get killed
for your country?

514
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,064
You gonna send him out to do
multiplication

515
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:38,232
or kill towel heads?

516
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,034
- All right, Mom...
- Geez,

517
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:41,701
no wonder you can't
win a fucking war.

518
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:44,037
- All right, thanks for your time.
- Because of shit heads like you

519
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:46,373
that we're all gonna be eating egg
rolls and speaking slant-eye.

520
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:49,109
Army too chicken shit?

521
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:53,513
Fuck you! We're
going to the Navy.

522
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:03,957
Veronica, I got
20 minutes left in my break.

523
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:05,258
That should give us enough time

524
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,492
to go three times, easy.

525
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,494
I just ate.

526
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,163
Mmm, that's okay.
I'll do all the work.

527
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:11,464
- Maybe later.
- Oh, come on,

528
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:12,832
the best part
about making a baby

529
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,401
is, you get to have sex
while we're doing it.

530
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:16,636
Not likely.

531
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,737
What're you talking about?

532
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:19,105
Making a baby.

533
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,941
Baby, I told you,
the ball doctor said

534
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:22,275
- we're good to go.
- Talking about me.

535
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:23,576
Went to the clinic today.

536
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:26,846
Said me having kids--
"not likely."

537
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,614
PID.

538
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:29,949
Is that bad?

539
00:24:29,983 --> 00:24:31,317
Bad enough.

540
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:33,319
It's gonna be okay, baby.

541
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:34,520
Never really wanted them anyway.

542
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,188
What? What do you mean?

543
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:38,190
I like things the way
they are. Why change?

544
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:40,259
- It's what we wanted.
- Not what I wanted.

545
00:24:40,293 --> 00:24:41,760
We talked about it.

546
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:43,695
I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear.

547
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:44,696
Oh, so you were lying?

548
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,997
You calling me a liar?

549
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,699
Maybe if you lied about it.

550
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:49,100
Maybe you were too busy thinking
about what you wanted.

551
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,536
Oh, so now you're
calling me selfish?

552
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,870
You know what, congratulations.

553
00:24:52,904 --> 00:24:54,872
You just got everything
you wanted all along.

554
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:59,744
Fuck, that hurt!

555
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,185
All right, GED
practice test next week,

556
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:08,887
and remember

557
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:11,823
knives count as weapons,
so please leave them at home.

558
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:13,725
I'm looking at you,
Miguel and Shontasia.

559
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:14,926
Who? Me?

560
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:17,896
Hi.

561
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,499
- Fiona Gallagher, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:23,368
Wondering if there's anything
more I should be doing.

563
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:25,070
Only the second class.

564
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:27,305
Anything I could
be studying at home?

565
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,573
Why'd you drop out
of high school?

566
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,375
I didn't have time.

567
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:32,143
Mm-hmm?

568
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,510
Family thing.

569
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:35,379
What are you going
to do with your GED?

570
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,000
I was tossing around the idea
of club restaurant managment,

571
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:41,019
but I found out
I'm under qualified.

572
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,589
I'm afraid the GED only
takes you so far nowadays.

573
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:46,426
Didn't mention that
in your opening remarks.

574
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,494
They encourage us not to.

575
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:50,764
Guess I need to aim
a little lower.

576
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:52,666
Massage therapist?

577
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,535
You're here because there's
a gap in your education,

578
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,104
not your intelligence.

579
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,605
You live near Daley College?

580
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:00,206
The JC?

581
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:01,708
They offer a range
of business courses.

582
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:03,710
They have scholarships,
financial aid.

583
00:26:03,744 --> 00:26:06,413
You can take classes while
holding down a full-time job.

584
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:07,748
You have the time now?

585
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:10,951
I might, yeah.

586
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:13,586
Don't have to aim low.

587
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,065
You're only my second patient.

588
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:26,533
My first one died.

589
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,602
So, one for one.

590
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,138
Aw.

591
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,740
Do you, um...

592
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:35,442
Do you want me to...

593
00:26:35,477 --> 00:26:39,079
to... end

594
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:42,216
your suffering?

595
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,751
You want me to...

596
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,958
You st say the
word, and I'll...

597
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,663
Yes? Was that a yes?

598
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,432
Yeah, it was just hard to hear.

599
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:00,634
Maybe if you

600
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:02,935
plug the hole with your finger?

601
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:06,005
Okay, bit of a whistle.

602
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,306
Maybe try the thumb.

603
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:09,942
Hungry?

604
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:12,110
Oh, yes!

605
00:27:12,145 --> 00:27:13,579
I have something special.

606
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:15,314
Yes, you just wait right there.

607
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:18,818
Um, hey!

608
00:27:18,852 --> 00:27:20,319
Look what I have.

609
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:23,589
Crème brûlée.

610
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:25,858
Would you like some?

611
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:27,260
Okay.

612
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:29,930
Let's see.

613
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:32,966
If I put this in your mouth,

614
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,503
is it just gonna spill
out that hole?

615
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:40,040
Monica!

616
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:43,143
I'm in here.

617
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:44,945
I'm replacing the shelf paper.

618
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,147
It's gonna look great in here.

619
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,417
What?

620
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,152
Want to apologize?

621
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:52,386
For what?

622
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,289
For leaving me in fucking
Indiana somewhere!

623
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:57,158
I should've hit
you with the car.

624
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:58,727
Walked ten, 15 miles.

625
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,696
You must be tired.

626
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,398
Froze my ass off.

627
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,735
How about a bath?

628
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,638
I'll run you a bath.

629
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:11,542
And then after, we can do

630
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:13,243
what we do best.

631
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:14,845
We don't have an eight ball.

632
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:16,180
Not that.

633
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:17,414
Sex?

634
00:28:17,448 --> 00:28:18,682
A kid.

635
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:20,083
Oh, Frank.

636
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:22,219
Let's do it;
who are we

637
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:27,024
to deny the world another
shining Gallagher star?

638
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,327
We had one kid on coke.

639
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:31,928
- Debbie.
- It was Carl.

640
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:33,096
No, Carl was E.

641
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:34,364
Thought Liam was E.

642
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,699
Liam was acid.

643
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:36,833
- Don't you remember?
- Yeah.

644
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:38,001
Christmas Eve,

645
00:28:38,036 --> 00:28:40,337
I got it from that
bail-bond guy?

646
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:41,905
We had our own rave.

647
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,241
Till the kids came downstairs

648
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:45,844
asking for fucking gifts.

649
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:49,414
But we've never made
a little rug rat on GHB.

650
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:51,884
Aw...

651
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,119
Yeah.

652
00:28:53,153 --> 00:28:55,288
Yeah, let's do it.

653
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:57,690
Not in my room.

654
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:01,260
Need to get shit-faced;
don't want to do it alone.

655
00:29:01,295 --> 00:29:02,595
I'll pour, you talk.

656
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,631
I'll get the cups.

657
00:29:04,665 --> 00:29:06,299
What do you want?

658
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,734
I have to cancel our date.

659
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:09,135
- What date?
- I'm sorry.

660
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:10,403
Just keep tomorrow
night free, okay?

661
00:29:10,437 --> 00:29:11,638
I-I got to go.

662
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:12,639
You find the ship?

663
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:14,607
Thank you.

664
00:29:14,642 --> 00:29:16,876
There's nothing on it.

665
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:19,312
I guess they
unloaded it already.

666
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:20,947
Where are the containers?

667
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:24,083
How the fuck should I know?

668
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:37,663
Fuck.

669
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:43,436
Easy.
Fuck.

670
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:47,340
Is that Linda's?

671
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:49,008
It already shot one Milkovich.

672
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:50,443
Look, I think I got a way

673
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:52,178
we can get rid of Mandy's dad.

674
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,846
Don't even have
to fire a bullet.

675
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:56,482
He's on parole, right?

676
00:29:56,516 --> 00:29:58,150
Kidnapping and grand theft auto.

677
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,985
All right, so what do you
think the cops would do

678
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,487
if they found one of
those in his house?

679
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:03,588
Linda will know if we took it.

680
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:04,923
Grammy's 9mm?

681
00:30:04,957 --> 00:30:06,825
He could get six years.

682
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:08,193
Yeah, or life.

683
00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:10,095
Serial numbers aren't
scratched off.

684
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:13,131
Gun's bound to have
racked up a body count.

685
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:15,333
All we have to do is plant it.

686
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,534
I got nothing to lose.

687
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:18,503
Bombed the trig midterm.

688
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:19,871
How bad?

689
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:21,140
I tried to enlist.

690
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:23,142
- What?
- Monica took me.

691
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:25,311
Figured Mandy's dad
couldn't kill me in Kabul.

692
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:26,946
Yeah, well, there's plenty
of fucking Muslims who could.

693
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:28,348
Well, they all turned me down.

694
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:31,551
The Army, the Navy,
Marines, Air Force.

695
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:33,787
Still got the Coast Guard.

696
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:37,524
It's my fucking funeral.

697
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:42,328
Look, just... lay low until
tomorrow morning, okay?

698
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:45,398
Don't forget the gun.

699
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:53,741
On top of managing
the upstairs bar,

700
00:30:53,775 --> 00:30:55,543
I could've gotten my
own night to promote.

701
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:57,812
Why are we talking about
a job you didn't get?

702
00:30:57,846 --> 00:31:01,716
- I really wanted it. - Don't spend time
thinking about things you can't have.

703
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:04,986
Doctor didn't say
it was impossible.

704
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:06,689
Close to it.

705
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:08,824
Since when do you take
no for an answer?

706
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,760
Since when do you?

707
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:17,033
♪ How can I just
let you walk away? ♪

708
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:21,071
♪ Just let you leave
without a trace ♪

709
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:25,408
♪ When I stand here
taking every breath ♪

710
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:27,410
♪ With you, ooh. ♪

711
00:31:29,413 --> 00:31:34,350
Sheila, you're the only one
who really knew me at all.

712
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,625
Wake up, baby, come on,

713
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:43,026
Mommy needs your help.

714
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,862
Where is Ian?

715
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,198
Come on, it's going to be fun.

716
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,733
Debbie,

717
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:52,270
don't forget your father.

718
00:31:57,775 --> 00:32:00,744
Thanks for letting me talk
your ear off last night, Fi.

719
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:03,079
I'll tell her
when she gets back.

720
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:05,448
Where the hell did
she go this early?

721
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:45,524
Hey, he's still in there.

722
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:48,260
- They leave a key anywhere?
- Door's unlocked.

723
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:50,495
- Who would be crazy enough to break in?
- Right.

724
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:52,731
You bring Grammy's gun?

725
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,201
Remember to wipe
your prints off.

726
00:32:58,137 --> 00:32:59,904
There he is.

727
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:17,189
Where should we plant it?

728
00:33:17,223 --> 00:33:19,692
Maybe beside all the others.

729
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:21,828
Jesus.

730
00:33:23,698 --> 00:33:26,767
It's like bringing a joint
to a crack house.

731
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:38,246
What the fuck?

732
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,167
Huh?!

733
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,341
Gonna fucking waste

734
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,244
- your Peter Pan ass.
- Put it down.

735
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,045
What the fuck you doing?

736
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,615
- Let him go.
- The little shit broke in.

737
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:11,383
- Wait, he's not the dad.
- He knows.

738
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:12,451
The fuck I do.

739
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:13,786
I told you whose it is.

740
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,490
Let him go, Dad.
This is between us.

741
00:34:26,735 --> 00:34:28,202
Your dad?

742
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:30,238
Another word and I'll
blow your brains all over

743
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,273
the fucking linoleum.

744
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:43,417
What are you doing down here?

745
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,085
I didn't want to sleep
in our bed without you.

746
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,254
Your eyes are red.

747
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:49,456
I couldn't sleep.

748
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,723
You?

749
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,394
I'll go first.

750
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,129
No, me.

751
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:57,163
I called you a liar.

752
00:34:57,198 --> 00:34:59,166
Only 'cause I am.

753
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,001
Said I didn't want kids.

754
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,971
I did.

755
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:05,372
Yeah.

756
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:11,779
You know, there are lots
of kids who need a home.

757
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:13,648
Fucked up foster kids like me?

758
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:15,283
Exactly.

759
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:17,485
We could build up our own army
like Wesley Snipes,

760
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,753
take over the neighborhood.

761
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:24,459
You know, no one said

762
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:26,594
that we have to stop trying.

763
00:35:26,629 --> 00:35:27,862
Oh...

764
00:35:28,998 --> 00:35:30,465
- Come here.
- Whoo!

765
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:39,040
I am going to slit your throat

766
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:41,342
with a motherfucking can opener!

767
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:42,644
I have no food.

768
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:44,512
My fucking phone is dying, man.

769
00:35:44,546 --> 00:35:46,681
I am trying to find you!

770
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:48,049
Estefania, please!

771
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,717
You were on your way
to a Costco

772
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:51,219
in Georgia but got rerouted.

773
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:53,688
I don't care, man,
don't fucking care.

774
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:57,192
Listen, I just finish an hour
conversation with my brother,

775
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:58,827
and he's dead 12 years.

776
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:00,162
Get me out of here!

777
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:01,463
Will you give it a rest?!

778
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:05,167
Hello?

779
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:08,337
Fuck!

780
00:36:09,606 --> 00:36:10,673
You--

781
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:12,742
dead man.

782
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:21,017
What are you doing?

783
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:24,253
What does it look like?
I'm steam-cleaning the rug.

784
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:26,423
I rented it
from Jewel-Osco.

785
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:28,859
When's the last time you
think this has been cleaned?

786
00:36:28,893 --> 00:36:30,594
How many miles did you run?

787
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:34,332
Uh, four.

788
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:36,033
You'll be up to six in no time.

789
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:39,236
Yeah, take a shower while
there's still hot water.

790
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:42,039
Hey, Carl.

791
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:45,242
Carl?

792
00:36:46,778 --> 00:36:48,746
Hey, just want a second
with Mandy, okay?

793
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,881
Will you need this?

794
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,388
I'll see you later.

795
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:59,423
Yep.

796
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:06,964
So...

797
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:10,601
When'd you get home?

798
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:13,304
Last night.

799
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:14,605
Hmm.

800
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,575
He drinks
and mistakes me for Mom.

801
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:18,810
Only once in a while.

802
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:20,311
Not like it's a big deal.

803
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:23,414
Watch the fucking look
on your face.

804
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:26,484
A Gallagher looking down
on me-- I don't think so.

805
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:30,221
Why'd he think it was me?

806
00:37:30,255 --> 00:37:34,526
He blacks out... forgets.

807
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:38,597
Lip better keep his mouth shut.

808
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:39,998
He will.

809
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:43,134
I just wish the whole thing
would go away.

810
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,339
We can make it.

811
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:49,575
You got $600 lying around?

812
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:50,709
We can raise it.

813
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:54,780
The money, not the baby.

814
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:59,118
You'd do that?

815
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,153
You're my girlfriend.

816
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:10,764
Anthony Bourdain?

817
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:12,799
Sanjay Gupta.

818
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:16,269
Nancy Grace!

819
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:17,503
There's got to be

820
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:19,672
a missing white girl somewhere.

821
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:22,342
Oh, Ruben, I'm trying.

822
00:38:22,376 --> 00:38:23,376
No?

823
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,378
You don't want TV,
you don't eat.

824
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:30,115
Do you have a wish
before you go,

825
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:32,084
anything I can get you?

826
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,822
Yeah?

827
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,896
Oh, oh, I don't,
I-I'm not sure what you mean.

828
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:44,565
Oh...

829
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,566
Milk, eggs.

830
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:47,168
Aw.

831
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:48,303
Hey, bro.

832
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:49,338
He can't hear you.

833
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:51,240
Is it getting cold out there?

834
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:52,708
Could use a shower.

835
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:55,011
Oh, uh, that's not a good idea.

836
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,382
Hey, I...

837
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:10,893
Uh, okay, I'll tell her.

838
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:13,362
So I spent the last few months

839
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:14,863
learning baby sign language.

840
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:17,232
He says he hates crème brûlée.

841
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:21,070
- Gives him the runs.
- Oh, I noticed that.

842
00:39:21,104 --> 00:39:22,538
Is there anything

843
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:23,572
he does like?

844
00:39:23,607 --> 00:39:25,908
Uh, what do you want to eat?

845
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:28,244
Know how to make cake?

846
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:29,746
Strawberry shortcake.

847
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,880
Strawberry shortcake?

848
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:31,881
Oh.

849
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:33,283
No, he says, "Fuck that."

850
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,853
Vanilla cake

851
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:39,390
with a shitload
of Grand Marnier.

852
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:41,892
Hey, you need to
watch your language, bro.

853
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:45,563
Uh, there's one more thing
before he kicks it.

854
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:46,730
Uh...

855
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:47,865
Want to fuck.

856
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,534
Hey, out of line, bro!

857
00:39:49,568 --> 00:39:51,202
That's a lady right there.

858
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:52,537
What'd he say?

859
00:39:52,572 --> 00:39:54,706
He's sorry.

860
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:57,642
He'll settle for something else.

861
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,749
Oh.

862
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,588
Put everything but the
Cristal in the cooler.

863
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:19,597
I want the job.

864
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,967
Fiona...

865
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,502
You asked if I've
managed before.

866
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:25,770
Yeah,

867
00:40:25,804 --> 00:40:27,305
a houseful of kids.

868
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:29,606
Taught me how to
smack with one hand

869
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:31,241
while giving a pat on
the back with the other.

870
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:33,076
Inventory, budgeting.

871
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,746
Go grocery shopping for a family
of six with what's in my pocket,

872
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,448
then let's talk.

873
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:40,751
At some point, somebody saw that
you were more than a cage dancer

874
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:42,687
and they took a chance on you.

875
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:50,395
I can do this.

876
00:40:52,465 --> 00:40:54,433
I got a pre-opening
event tonight.

877
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:55,667
Things move fast,
got to keep up.

878
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:57,336
I will.

879
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:00,205
All right,
let's give it a shot.

880
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,840
That's what managers wear.

881
00:41:01,874 --> 00:41:05,944
Pick out your size.
I got to go audition DJs.

882
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,946
I'm gonna kick ass, Meg.

883
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,449
All right, I'll see you at 9:00.

884
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:14,453
Okay, cool.
Yeah, thanks, man.

885
00:41:14,487 --> 00:41:15,887
Kev says we're all set

886
00:41:15,922 --> 00:41:18,323
- for the Alibi.
- Why do we even have to do

887
00:41:18,357 --> 00:41:19,991
- this stupid fund-raiser?
- Mandy needs our help.

888
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:23,026
Got more chocolate chip cookies.

889
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:24,361
Every buck counts, right?

890
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,029
Who wants another batch?

891
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:28,298
Peanut butter, toffee?

892
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,034
Where is the tape?
Can't find anything

893
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:31,168
in this kitchen.

894
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:33,036
When are we moving
the furniture back?

895
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:36,305
Oh, Debbie, I love your poster.

896
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:37,706
Who did you get your
artistic talent from?

897
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,243
Who wants to sample a cookie?

898
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:41,978
Me.

899
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:43,178
Uh, they're for
the fund-raiser.

900
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:44,547
Blood sugar is dipping,

901
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:45,648
trying to keep up
with your mother.

902
00:41:45,682 --> 00:41:47,049
She is wearing me out.

903
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:48,250
I'm done with the flyer.

904
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:53,056
Uh, it's "fund-raiser,"
not "fun razor."

905
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,326
Want 'em to show up, make 'em
think someone's getting cut.

906
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:59,596
All right, make copies, man.

907
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,730
Oh, I'll take him.

908
00:42:00,764 --> 00:42:02,398
Come on, you and me, Carl.

909
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:03,900
We can take the new car.

910
00:42:03,934 --> 00:42:05,101
Can't get enough
Carl and Mommy time.

911
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:06,602
Do you need some new clothes?

912
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:08,070
We could stop at JCPenney.

913
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:09,405
I can drive.

914
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,807
Do you have a license?

915
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,845
Mom's never going to

916
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:18,214
shampoo the rug, is she?

917
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:22,852
Will you calm down, okay?

918
00:42:22,886 --> 00:42:25,856
Just will you sit
down and take a seat?

919
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,424
Okay, if I hear what you
were saying, I'm sure

920
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,426
that it's great,
but can you see

921
00:42:29,461 --> 00:42:31,061
that I am trying my best?

922
00:42:32,097 --> 00:42:34,865
You! Where have you been?!

923
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,533
I'm not on fucking retainer.

924
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,568
Okay, Marco's disappeared.

925
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:41,904
He's on a truck somewhere,
no idea where.

926
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:42,972
That's not good.

927
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:45,974
Whoa, you know Portuguese?

928
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:47,042
Yeah, it's like Italian.

929
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:49,877
She says if you don't
find Marco alive,

930
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:50,978
she's gonna call her father.

931
00:42:51,013 --> 00:42:52,280
Okay.

932
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:53,380
I hope you're not wed

933
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:54,948
to your eyes or your...

934
00:42:54,983 --> 00:42:56,116
tongue.

935
00:42:58,353 --> 00:42:59,253
Or your dick.

936
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:00,821
Here, hold this.

937
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,058
No, no, no, no, no.
Who are you calling?

938
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:07,161
I got a Teamster
friend in local 710.

939
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:11,065
Yeah, yo, Tully.

940
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,103
I'm looking for a container one
of your drivers is hauling.

941
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,437
Uh-huh.

942
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:17,672
Yeah, sure I can hold.

943
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:24,244
Oh, shit, Carl. Carl.

944
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:25,513
Come on. Switch places.

945
00:43:25,547 --> 00:43:27,948
Quick. Quick.

946
00:43:33,722 --> 00:43:35,656
Hi.

947
00:43:37,192 --> 00:43:38,559
You're supposed to
have your seatbelt on.

948
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:42,095
Think these'll match?

949
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:43,596
- Mm-hmm.
- What are you looking up?

950
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:44,597
Nothing.

951
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:46,199
It's my computer.

952
00:43:46,233 --> 00:43:48,534
You don't know how to do
private browsing.

953
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:50,235
I'll check the history later.

954
00:43:53,406 --> 00:43:54,773
Richard Daley College?

955
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:56,341
Just seeing what's out there.

956
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:58,276
You got to get Lip back
in high school first

957
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:00,178
before you got any shot
of getting him to college.

958
00:44:00,213 --> 00:44:02,314
Actually, it's for me.

959
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:04,550
I pass my GED next month,

960
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:06,219
I can enroll for January.

961
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:07,620
I could fit in
two classes a day

962
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:08,956
before I'd have
to be at the club.

963
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,290
Study up on marketing,
I could be

964
00:44:10,324 --> 00:44:11,725
promoting my own night
before the end

965
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:12,826
of the semester.

966
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,995
Good for you, Fi.

967
00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:16,697
Why didn't you just say so?

968
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:19,065
I thought you was looking
at Kev dick pics.

969
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:25,972
Hey, Gallagher.

970
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:27,906
Seen Fiona? I've been
looking for her.

971
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:29,174
Why, what's up?

972
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:30,509
Your mom's down at the station.

973
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,878
Bring bail money.

974
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:02,073
Dying wish.

975
00:45:02,107 --> 00:45:04,075
How are we gonna
feed it to him?

976
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:06,443
Oh.

977
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:17,021
Think he wants another hit.

978
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:20,091
He worked so hard to get clean.

979
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:23,729
Sometimes it's not worth
holding out.

980
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,765
Life's too short.

981
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:28,234
Why not just give in?

982
00:45:50,255 --> 00:45:52,156
Christ.

983
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,557
I'm not here for your stash.

984
00:45:53,591 --> 00:45:55,058
I need bail money.

985
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:56,460
I only have a grand.

986
00:45:57,495 --> 00:45:59,363
You have a grand?

987
00:46:07,172 --> 00:46:09,239
- Where's the Squirrel Fund?
- What the hell

988
00:46:09,274 --> 00:46:10,741
is a Squirrel Fund?

989
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:11,976
Empty your fucking pockets.

990
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,345
You talk to your
father that way?

991
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:25,255
Get the fucking key

992
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:28,492
and get me out of here!

993
00:46:28,526 --> 00:46:30,026
I want my phone call!

994
00:46:32,296 --> 00:46:35,265
Get my lawyer, Rodney
King your asses.

995
00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:36,666
Your brother was driving.

996
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,134
He got a nasty bump,
but he'll be fine.

997
00:46:38,169 --> 00:46:39,770
I told my captain

998
00:46:39,805 --> 00:46:41,706
your mom was driving
under the influence.

999
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,941
You feel powerful
locking me up?

1000
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:45,310
She's not making it easy.

1001
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:48,546
I'm not invisible!

1002
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,281
Hey, buddy, you doing okay?

1003
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:51,983
Do you hear me?

1004
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,819
I'm right here.

1005
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:58,490
I'm right here. Here!

1006
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,866
What the fuck is this?

1007
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,067
We're raising money.

1008
00:47:10,102 --> 00:47:11,035
For Mandy.

1009
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:12,971
$25, all the well
drinks you want.

1010
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:15,140
Hey, guys,
you got ten minutes to sign up

1011
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:16,574
for the pool tournament,

1012
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:18,409
five dollar entry fee;
bragging rights are at stake.

1013
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,044
Hey, thanks for all
your help, Kev.

1014
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,746
Yeah, too many Gallaghers
in the world already.

1015
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,547
Lip, now you?

1016
00:47:23,582 --> 00:47:24,415
Instead of passing

1017
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:25,816
rubbers out at schools,

1018
00:47:25,851 --> 00:47:27,851
they should be passing
them out at your house.

1019
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:29,152
Hey, Debbie. Cookies?

1020
00:47:29,187 --> 00:47:30,487
Oh.

1021
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:32,355
We have dollar a cookie,

1022
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:35,058
buck 50 a brownie,
70 for the gun.

1023
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:38,395
Oh, hey, how'd you get
so many people here?

1024
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,565
Told them the proceeds
go to a great cause.

1025
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,734
It's for a church retreat.

1026
00:47:42,768 --> 00:47:44,436
Kids with cleft palates.

1027
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,904
Here.

1028
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:47,506
The NRA.

1029
00:47:47,541 --> 00:47:50,276
The resistance against
the Zionist occupation.

1030
00:47:50,311 --> 00:47:51,478
Hmm.

1031
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:09,762
Hey, wow,

1032
00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:10,863
you look great.

1033
00:48:10,897 --> 00:48:13,866
Where's Pele?

1034
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,100
Florida, sunshine state.

1035
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:17,136
Heading to the airport,
just wanted to stop by

1036
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:18,371
and ask for another rain check.

1037
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:19,873
Rain check?

1038
00:48:19,907 --> 00:48:21,708
Yeah.

1039
00:48:21,743 --> 00:48:23,276
Tomorrow I'm all yours, okay?

1040
00:48:23,311 --> 00:48:25,312
Who says I want you?

1041
00:48:40,964 --> 00:48:42,564
Where the fuck have you been?

1042
00:48:42,598 --> 00:48:44,833
Oh, what, you back for
good or just visiting?

1043
00:48:44,867 --> 00:48:46,434
Just bailed Monica out of jail.

1044
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:48,236
What? Why?

1045
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,170
Cops and their

1046
00:48:49,204 --> 00:48:51,072
fucking quotas,
why do you think?

1047
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:52,974
She let Carl play bumper cars
with a Buick.

1048
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:54,141
Is he okay?

1049
00:48:54,176 --> 00:48:55,343
"Is he okay?"

1050
00:48:55,377 --> 00:48:57,278
What about your mother?

1051
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,748
She birthed
your ungrateful asses.

1052
00:48:59,782 --> 00:49:00,916
I'm late for a meeting.

1053
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,451
They said Carl's gonna be fine,

1054
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:04,520
but it's hard to tell
because he's

1055
00:49:04,554 --> 00:49:06,422
- normally concussed more than he isn't.
- Well,

1056
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:07,623
don't let him fall asleep.

1057
00:49:07,658 --> 00:49:08,691
What, you're AWOL
this whole time,

1058
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:09,759
now you're giving orders?

1059
00:49:09,794 --> 00:49:11,462
- I was around.
- Really?

1060
00:49:11,496 --> 00:49:13,997
So you know Monica spent
all the Squirrel Fund money?

1061
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:18,435
You know what, I wouldn't
have even had the cash

1062
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,203
to bail her out if I
didn't return a bunch

1063
00:49:20,204 --> 00:49:22,151
of dolls I found
in Debbie's room!

1064
00:49:22,186 --> 00:49:23,473
The first rule

1065
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:24,708
you learn in this house,

1066
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:26,542
you hide the goddamn money.

1067
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:31,514
- She seemed better.
- Look at this place.

1068
00:49:31,548 --> 00:49:34,650
The sofa is in the kitchen.

1069
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:36,986
For fuck's sake, she tried
to get Ian to enlist.

1070
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:38,855
She what?

1071
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:41,390
What did you think
was gonna happen, Fiona?

1072
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:44,660
Thought it might
be different this time.

1073
00:49:44,695 --> 00:49:48,431
Hm, well, how'd that Kool-Aid
taste going down?

1074
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:52,835
Where is she?

1075
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:04,914
You could've gotten
Carl killed!

1076
00:50:04,948 --> 00:50:06,916
You tried to get Ian
into the army?!

1077
00:50:08,685 --> 00:50:11,386
You promised me.

1078
00:50:11,421 --> 00:50:13,188
Get out of bed!

1079
00:50:15,591 --> 00:50:18,027
Get out of bed, Mom!

1081
00:51:57,832 --> 00:52:00,434
Get me out of here! Please!

1082
00:52:05,674 --> 00:52:07,467
Help!
