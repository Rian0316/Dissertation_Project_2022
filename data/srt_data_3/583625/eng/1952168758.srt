1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,128
Ross kissed me.

2
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:08,624
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

3
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:10,117
It was unbelievable!

4
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:13,324
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:14,708
Let's hear everything.

6
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:17,412
Monica, get the wine
and unplug the phone.

7
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:20,945
Rachel, does this end well
or do we need to get tissues?

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,237
It ended very well.

9
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:27,060
Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

10
00:00:27,148 --> 00:00:29,708
Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,153
Was it a soft brush
against your lips...

12
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:35,934
...or was it a "I gotta have you now"
kind of thing?

13
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:40,268
Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then...

14
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,592
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

15
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:47,185
So was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

16
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,644
No, actually, first
they started out on my waist...

17
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:53,254
...and then they slid up
and were in my hair.

18
00:00:56,294 --> 00:00:57,226
And...

19
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:58,692
...then I kissed her.

20
00:00:58,841 --> 00:00:59,637
Tongue?

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,574
- Yeah.
- Cool.

22
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:07,052
The One With the List

23
00:01:45,783 --> 00:01:47,842
All right, check out this bad boy!

24
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:51,247
Twelve megabytes of RAM,
500-megabyte hard drive...

25
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:53,077
...built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

26
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:57,001
...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 BPS.

27
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:58,860
What will you use it for?

28
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,315
Games and stuff.

29
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:05,605
There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

30
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,442
Oh, wait, here's one.

31
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,300
- Would you be willing to cook naked?
- There's an ad for a naked chef?

32
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:16,988
No, but if you'll cook naked, then
you might be willing to dance naked.

33
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:18,372
And then...

34
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:23,909
So how'd you make out last night?

35
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:29,943
That is funny.
That is painfully funny.

36
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,387
No, wait, wait.

37
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:33,824
Yeah, that's just painful.

38
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:37,012
Wait a minute.
I thought last night was great.

39
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,927
Yeah, it was.
But I get home...

40
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:42,202
...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...

41
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,708
...and I think,
"My God! What am I doing?"

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,667
Here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...

43
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:50,386
...who I care about
and who cares about me...

44
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,549
...and I'm just
throwing all that away?

45
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:54,996
You got all that
from saline solution?

46
00:02:56,338 --> 00:03:00,399
I'm the same way. Show me a bottle
of wine. And I'm like, Wow, who am I?

47
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:05,577
Wait. We're talking about Rachel.
You and Rachel.

48
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:08,548
I've been dreaming about
me and Rachel for 10 years.

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,329
But now I'm with Julie.

50
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:13,320
So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.

51
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:15,470
Me and Julie, me and Rach

52
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,115
Rachel! Rachel.

53
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,314
- Hey, you.
- How are you?

54
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:21,882
Good. How are you?

55
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:23,021
Good.

56
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,810
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

57
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:27,381
Julie!

58
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:30,088
How are you?

59
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:31,424
Good.

60
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,167
So everybody's here.

61
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:35,817
Everybody's good.

62
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:39,143
Good, Great, and here!

63
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:43,304
Were you gonna play something?

64
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,437
- Well, actually
- Play it!

65
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,596
All right.

66
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,825
- Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
- What?

67
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:55,341
Okay. Hi.

68
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:58,008
Hello. Hi. Okay.

69
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,339
This is a song about a love triangle...

70
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,394
...between three people I made up.

71
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:10,622
It's called
"Two of Them Kissed Last Night."

72
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:17,534
There was a girl
We'll call her Betty

73
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:20,815
And a guy
Let's call him Neil

74
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:25,157
Now I can't stress
This point too strongly

75
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,356
This story isn't real

76
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:34,922
Now our Neil must decide
Who will be the girl that he casts aside

77
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,066
Will Betty be the one
Who he loves truly

78
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:40,501
Or will it be the one
Who we'll call Loolie

79
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:46,069
He must decide
He must decide

80
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:49,528
Even though I made him up
He must decide

81
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,292
Well, this is a nice resume.

82
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,688
Nice, nice, nice.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,707
Muy impressivo.

84
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,028
Shame! It not all true.

85
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:04,832
Forget it.

86
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:08,720
No, it's all true.
I'm just a little nervous, that's all!

87
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:10,816
I am fine now.

88
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:14,650
Mr. Rastatter, what does this
job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

89
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:17,050
Macholate.

90
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:19,024
- I'm sorry?
- Macholate.

91
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,403
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

92
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,923
Go ahead, try a piece.

93
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:29,055
We think Macholate is
even better than chocolate.

94
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:30,080
All right.

95
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,628
I love how it crumbles.

96
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,054
- You see, chocolate doesn't do that.
- No, ma'am.

97
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,895
We should be getting
our FDA approval any day now.

98
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:51,766
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

99
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:54,279
The way we see it,
chocolate dominates...

100
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:59,159
...your major food-preparation holidays.
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

101
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,164
But given the right marketing...

102
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:03,743
...we can make Thanksgiving
the Macholate holiday.

103
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:05,980
Wow.

104
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,737
Aren't you gonna swallow that?

105
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,727
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

106
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,210
Isn't that great?

107
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:16,814
Well, anyhow...

108
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:20,456
...we're looking for chefs
who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

109
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,713
You interested?

110
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:22,702
Abso...

111
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,099
...- lutely!

112
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,329
I love creating recipes,
I love Thanksgiving, and now...

113
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:31,518
...I love Macholate.

114
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,733
Really?

115
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,533
Especially that aftertaste.
I tell you...

116
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:37,634
...that'll last you till Christmas.

117
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,301
How about Macholate mousse?

118
00:06:43,724 --> 00:06:44,850
It's not...

119
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:46,600
...very Thanksgiving-y.

120
00:06:46,993 --> 00:06:49,484
How about Pilgrim Macholate mousse?

121
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:51,483
What makes it Pilgrim?

122
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:53,567
We'll put buckles on it.

123
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,029
Did Ross call?

124
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,845
No, I'm sorry.

125
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,064
Why didn't he call?

126
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,958
He's gonna stay with Julie.

127
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,154
He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:

128
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,525
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

129
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:12,715
We'll get married and have lots
of kids and dig up stuff together!"

130
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,724
No offense, but that
sounds nothing like her.

131
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:23,372
What am I gonna do?
This is like a complete nightmare!

132
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:27,499
I know. This must be so hard.
"Oh, no! Two women love me!

133
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:31,790
They're both gorgeous,
my wallet's too small for my 50s...

134
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:34,297
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

135
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:39,035
- Here's a thought
- Don't ever touch the computer.

136
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,956
Ross, listen.
I got two words for you:

137
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:44,211
Threesome.

138
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,040
You still have another
word if you wanna use it.

139
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:56,636
Hey, I think I know what is it, HELP!

140
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,429
Let's get logical about this.
We'll make a list.

141
00:07:59,498 --> 00:08:01,898
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

142
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:08,417
We'll put their names
in different fonts...

143
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,922
...and I can use different
colors for each column.

144
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,385
Can't we use a pen?

145
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,437
No, Amish boy.

146
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:19,854
Let's start with the cons
because they're more fun.

147
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:20,731
Rachel first.

148
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:22,790
I don't know.

149
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,464
I mean...

150
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,114
All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

151
00:08:29,304 --> 00:08:30,965
You could say that.

152
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:36,604
I guess, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?

153
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:39,623
And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.

154
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,145
And Julie and I have
a lot in common...

155
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,154
...because we're both
paleontologists, right?

156
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:47,042
But Rachel's just a waitress.

157
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:48,560
Waitress.

158
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:50,986
Got it.
You guys want to play Doom?

159
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,542
Or we could keep doing this.

160
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,290
What else?

161
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:00,156
I don't know.

162
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:04,503
Oh! Her ankles are a little chubby.

163
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:07,420
Okay, let's do Julie.

164
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:08,857
What's wrong with her?

165
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,184
She's not Rachel.

166
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:19,020
This is pumpkin pie
with a Macholate crust.

167
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:22,740
This is Macholate cranberry cake,
and these are Macholate-chip cookies.

168
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,840
Just like the Indians served.

169
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:29,024
Oh, my God!

170
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:30,190
"Oh, my God" good?

171
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:33,954
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you let me put this in my mouth.

172
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,421
Sweet Lord!
This is what evil must taste like!

173
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:45,707
I tell you, it won't print.

174
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:49,436
I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

175
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:51,443
For a hotline, you're not so hot.

176
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,357
What is that in the background?

177
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:56,913
Are you watching Star Trek?

178
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,178
So how was going with Julie.
Did you break her heart?

179
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:11,956
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

180
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,573
I did the right thing.

181
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:18,322
So Spock actually hugs his father?

182
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,831
Hey, do you guys have

183
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:26,659
Where you going?

184
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,199
I just got back...

185
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,456
...from Julie's.

186
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:34,928
No, no.

187
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:36,959
It's not what you think.

188
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,706
It's the other thing.

189
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:48,323
Well, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

190
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,448
Well...

191
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:52,797
He broke up with Julie!

192
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:57,438
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

193
00:10:58,621 --> 00:10:59,553
Really?

194
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,652
Really.

195
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,535
It's always been you, Rach.

196
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:05,310
Oh, God.

197
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:17,785
Oh, this is good.

198
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:19,951
- This is really good.
- I know. I know.

199
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:21,616
It's almost...

200
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:30,858
What do you say we take a walk?
Just us. Not them.

201
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:33,502
- Let me get my coat.
- Okay. No, hey!

202
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:35,611
I'll get your coat.

203
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:45,845
He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat, Joey!

204
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,998
Joey, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!

205
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:52,427
- What's that?
- What? Nothing!

206
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:57,699
- I saw my name. What is it?
- No, no, see? See?

207
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,526
It's printing!

208
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:00,695
It's printing!

209
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:03,866
Let me see!

210
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:05,610
Hey, someone order a coat?

211
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:09,046
Chandler wrote something about me
and won't let me see.

212
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,911
He won't? He won't!

213
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:14,254
Because isn't that...

214
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:16,485
...the short story you were writing?

215
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:19,539
Yes, it is a short story...

216
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,902
...that I was writing.

217
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:22,922
And I'm in it?
Let me read it.

218
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:24,004
No!

219
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:29,913
- Come on!
- Hey, why don't you read it to her?

220
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,484
All right.

221
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,063
"It was summer.

222
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:54,713
And it was hot.

223
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:57,235
Rachel was there.

224
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:02,450
A lonely gray couch.

225
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:06,374
'Oh, look! ' cried Ned.

226
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:09,962
And the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"

227
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:16,546
That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!

228
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:19,183
This isn't funny anymore.

229
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:23,289
There's something about me
on that paper, and I want to see it.

230
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,369
No, you don't.

231
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,612
All right, fine. If you guys want
to be children, that's fine.

232
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,200
I do not need to see it!

233
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:39,299
What is this?

234
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:40,894
That is...

235
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,229
What is this?

236
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,032
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

237
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,522
Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

238
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:52,664
"Kind of ditzy"?

239
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:54,889
"Too into her looks"?

240
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,106
"Spoiled"?

241
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:00,826
A little spoiled. He was supposed
to type "little," the idiot!

242
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,878
"Just a waitress"?

243
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,731
Now that was...

244
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,173
I mean, as opposed to...

245
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,838
Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

246
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:16,830
I do not have chubby ankles!

247
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:17,985
No! I

248
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,274
Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

249
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:23,386
"She's not Rachem"?

250
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,050
What the hell's a Rachem?

251
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,282
Is that a stupid paleontology word...

252
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:30,727
...I wouldn't know,
because I'm just a waitress?

253
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,632
Rach, come on!

254
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:36,452
It's "She's not Rachel"!

255
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,433
She's not...

256
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,242
My diary! Brilliant!

257
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:51,188
If I'd said it was my diary,
she wouldn't have made me read it.

258
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:55,721
That's true. You'd be a great person
to have around after an emergency.

259
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:59,213
I cannot believe Ross
even made this list.

260
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:01,737
- I know.
- What a dinkus!

261
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:05,923
Hey, cut him some slack.
It was Chandler's idea.

262
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:07,359
What?

263
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,979
Oh, good. I was hoping
that would come up.

264
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,398
This was your idea?

265
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:16,976
Let's get some perspective here.
These things happen for a reason.

266
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:18,571
Yeah. You!

267
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:24,032
Pheebs, back me up. You believe
in that karma crap, don't you?

268
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:27,786
By the way, good luck
in your next life as a dung beetle.

269
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,453
Rach!

270
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,529
Hey! Open up! Please?

271
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:54,645
When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means, "Go away."

272
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,803
It doesn't mean,
"Climb up the fire escape."

273
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:59,494
I just want to read you
your "Pro List."

274
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,959
Not interested.

275
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,985
"Number one:
The way you cry at game shows.

276
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:09,767
Number two:
How much you love your friends.

277
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,788
Number three: The way you play
with your hair when you're nervous.

278
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:17,655
Number four: How brave you are
for starting your life over.

279
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,746
Number five:
How great you are with Ben.

280
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:23,492
Number six: The way you smell."

281
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,544
What are you doing?

282
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:28,519
You want to open the window?

283
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:29,555
Oh, yeah.

284
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:33,443
- What are you doing out there?
- I'm...

285
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:36,032
You must be freezing.
You know what you need?

286
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:39,205
How about a nice, steaming
cup of hot Macholate?

287
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:44,123
Come on, open up.

288
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:48,292
Rach, come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

289
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,329
No.

290
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,384
- No?
- That's what I said.

291
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:53,518
Maybe we should go.

292
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:55,777
You don't have to go.
We're done.

293
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:57,411
I know how you must

294
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,217
No! You don't, Ross.

295
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:03,557
Imagine the worst things
you think about yourself.

296
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:07,789
How would you feel if the person
you trusted most in the world...

297
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,403
...not only thinks them too...

298
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:13,469
...but actually uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

299
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:17,900
No, but see, I want to be with you
in spite of all those things.

300
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,119
Well, that's mighty big of you.

301
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:22,091
I said, don't go!

302
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:26,925
You know what?

303
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:31,848
If it were the other way around, there
is nothing you could put on a list...

304
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:34,422
...that would make me
not want to be with you.

305
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:38,163
Well, then I guess that's
the difference between us.

306
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:40,642
See, I'd never make a list.

307
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:59,872
I never know how long to wait
in this situation before you can talk.

308
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,997
Maybe a little longer.

309
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:11,231
In these recipes,
the quantities may seem unusual.

310
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,319
Like these coconut Macholate
holiday nut bars?

311
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:17,428
I've indicated four cups of coconut
and four cups of nuts...

312
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:20,541
...and only one tablespoon
of Macholate.

313
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:23,255
Doesn't matter.

314
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,486
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

315
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,463
Something about laboratory rats.

316
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:31,424
Gosh, I'm sorry.

317
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:32,394
Yeah.

318
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:34,905
Anyhow, here's your check.

319
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:38,361
Thank you for all the trouble
you went through.

320
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:42,697
Listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

321
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:44,131
Well, I ate some.

322
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,996
Oh, some is fine.
Some is not a lot.

323
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,103
So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

324
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,112
Is that him again?

325
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,986
Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighing me down.

326
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,392
I don't think this is the best time.

327
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,399
Look, can you do something for me?

328
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:21,819
Sure. What?

329
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:26,551
All right.

330
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:30,949
Music?

331
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:32,453
Sure.

332
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,127
The next one's dedicated
to Rachel from Ross.

333
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,045
Rachel, he wants you to know
he's sorry for what he did...

334
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,870
...and he hopes you can forgive him.

335
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:52,496
See the stones set in your eyes

336
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:56,527
See the thorn twist in your side

337
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:00,436
I'll wait for you

338
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:08,376
Sleight of hand and twist of fate

339
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:13,412
On a bed of nails she makes me wait

340
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:17,738
And I'll wait without you

341
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:22,609
We've just gotten a call from Rachel
and she told us what Ross did.

342
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,520
It's pretty appalling.
And, Ross, if you're listening...

343
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:28,299
...I don't want to play
your song anymore.

344
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:36,390
Why don't we devote our time
to a couple that stands a chance?

345
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,916
Avery, Michelle's sorry
she hit you with her car...

346
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,195
...and she hopes you two
will work it out.

347
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:44,360
There's a room where

348
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:47,835
I can go

349
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:52,389
And tell my secrets to

350
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,805
In my room

351
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:02,059
In my room

352
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,135
Thanks for coming in again.

353
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:18,010
Not at all. I have no morals,
and I need the cash.

354
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,224
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

355
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:24,382
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

356
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,844
They taste exactly
like pistachios...

357
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,914
...but they're made
of reconstituted fish bits.

358
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:32,813
Here, try one.

359
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,900
- All right.
- You're not allergic to anything?

360
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:37,397
Cat hair.

361
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,974
Oh, sorry.
