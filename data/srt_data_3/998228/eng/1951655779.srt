1
00:00:00,328 --> 00:00:02,431
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,051
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm in love with you.

3
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:06,772
Victor caught
Gaby by surprise...

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,607
Why would a four-star chef
wanna slum at a pizza joint?

5
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:11,177
Lynette took a gamble...

6
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:13,461
-He has a history using cocaine.
-No, no way.

7
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,449
Well, but he's been
clean for almost a year.

8
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:17,071
Mike bet on love...

9
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:19,039
I win, you leave me
and Susan alone.

10
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,260
And lost...

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,150
Don't panic.

12
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:23,709
But still came
to Susan's rescue.

13
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:25,118
You okay?

14
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:26,152
Yeah.

15
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:29,773
And Mrs. McCluskey
revealed her secret

16
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:31,792
for a lasting relationship.

17
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,340
It was late on
a Tuesday night

18
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:39,320
when the power went
out all over Fairview.

19
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:44,840
For most of the residents,
it was a minor inconvenience.

20
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,400
But for those with secrets,

21
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:50,910
the darkness proved
quite useful indeed.

22
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,911
Millie Russell was
able to indulge

23
00:00:54,917 --> 00:00:57,091
in another night
of midnight binging.

24
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:01,160
Timmy Cooper was able
to sneak another peek

25
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:03,861
at his father's
adult magazines.

26
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:08,403
Marilyn Quinn was able
to steal a few more puffs

27
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:10,272
of her forbidden tobacco.

28
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:15,932
But these secrets paled
compared to the one

29
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:19,243
a certain old woman was
hiding in her basement.

30
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,871
You sit tight, Ida.
I got batteries here.

31
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,683
No, I keep them in the freezer
for just such an emergency.

32
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:26,903
I'll run 'em over to you.

33
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:32,400
By the way, yowouldn't happen to have
any extra ice laying around, would ya?

34
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:36,263
No, I've just got some
stuff in my freezer

35
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,483
I don't want thawing
out anytime soon.

36
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:45,553
Yes, as a rule, darkness helps us
keep our secrets safely hidden.

37
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:47,111
Oh, crap!

38
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:56,711
But every rule...

39
00:01:57,598 --> 00:01:58,770
Karen, what's happened?

40
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:00,202
Are you okay?

41
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,373
Has its exceptions.

44
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:49,672
When the lights went
out on Wisteria Lane,

45
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:54,042
Karen McCluskey wasn't the
only reside left in the dark.

46
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:59,322
Everyone else felt the pain of
going without power as well.

47
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:02,873
Ow! Damn! Thumbtack!

48
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,952
Susan, please let me help.

49
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,563
No, no, I got it.

50
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:08,072
Oh, wait.

51
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,313
Here we go.

52
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,271
But it's hardly
a long-term solution.

53
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:18,830
Well, at least it'll keep me from
stabbing myself while I look.

54
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:19,963
But this is silly.

55
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:22,110
Why don't we just borrow
a flashlight from Mike?

56
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,472
Mike?

57
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,782
He's a plumber.
He's bound to have a spare.

58
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:31,171
Sure, but we can't keep leaning
on him for everything.

59
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,863
"Mike, we're drowning. Save us."

60
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,313
"Mike, it's dark.
Give us a flashlight."

61
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:35,273
Let's go ask Gaby.

62
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,932
Actually, I wanted to
talk to him anyway.

63
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:38,811
I thought we might ask
him over for dinner.

64
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:39,963
Dinner?

65
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,700
You know,
as a thank you gesture.

66
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:45,393
Well, Ian, you've
tasted my cooking.

67
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,283
It's not a thank you.
It's revenge.

68
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:49,300
Well, then I'll cook.

69
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,561
You know, you told me I should
put my jealousy behind me.

70
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,872
I think breaking bread together
would be a great start.

71
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:56,242
Well, let's not
bother him tonight.

72
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:58,101
You know, I don't really
even need a flashlight.

73
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,062
My eyes have totally
adjusted to the dark.

74
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:04,190
What was that?

75
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:06,180
Don't walk in the kitchen.

76
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:10,420
Anyway, where is your
sense of romance?

77
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:12,542
It's a blackout.

78
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:14,740
You have a defenseless lady.

79
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:16,403
Getting any ideas?

80
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:18,531
Well, I'm starting to, yes.

81
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:20,840
It's funny.

82
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:24,510
All that time I wasted worrying
Mike would come between us...

83
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,413
It seems so laughable
now, doesn't it?

84
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:31,940
Kiss me.

85
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,171
Hey, Carlos,
we had a blackout.

86
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:39,743
You need a flashlight?

87
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:43,140
Carlos, you okay?

88
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,423
Sorry, man.
I thought I heard a thud.

89
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:53,200
I just, um,
bumped into a chair.

90
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:58,621
I didn't think that you were
coming home till tomorrow.

91
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:00,792
Nah, fish weren't bitin'.

92
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:02,693
So, uh...

93
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:04,860
You got a girl in here?

94
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:06,482
No. Why?

95
00:05:07,735 --> 00:05:11,320
'Cause when I came home,
I thought I heard sex nois.

96
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:12,751
No, that was just me.

97
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:17,003
Okay.

98
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:18,633
Night.

99
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,210
Oh, God,
that was close.

100
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,493
All this sneaking
around is ridiculous!

101
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:28,961
Mike and I dated for...

102
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:30,721
five minutes.

103
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:32,642
He's not gonna care.

104
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:34,280
What if Travers finds out?

105
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,002
Look, I don't want
him to be confused,

106
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,252
and until we figure out
where this is going,

107
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:39,180
I just...

108
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:41,600
think we should keep
things on the down low.

109
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,163
Hey, I didn't say
we had to stop.

110
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:45,413
I just said
we had to quiet.

111
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:45,991
What?

112
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:48,272
I suppose we should tiptoe
around like schoolchildren

113
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,271
so our parents don't
catch us doing it?

114
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:52,282
I feel like I'm 12 again.

115
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,603
I'm just saying, I don't think that
the whole world needs to know our...

116
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:56,270
12?

117
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:57,762
Okay, look...

118
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,862
I will find us another
place to rendezvous.

119
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,331
But I'm not gonna
skulk around forever.

120
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:07,653
And no one's
asking you to.

121
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,813
I respect you too
much for that.

122
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:17,400
If you don't mind...

123
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,830
Oh, for God sake...

124
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:34,593
I'm gonna be right there.

125
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:35,753
Here you go.

126
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,483
So can you still cook
with the power out?

127
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:40,001
Of course!

128
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:41,890
Absolutely!

129
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,173
Please, please, tell me
we can still make pizza.

130
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:45,140
No dice.

131
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:47,821
Some genius installed pizza
ovens with electric starters.

132
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:49,611
This is awful.

133
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:52,220
On a good night,
we barely break even.

134
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:54,550
Tonight is gonna kill
the whole week.

135
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:57,411
Not necessarily.

136
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,361
The stovetop's gas.

137
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:01,022
I bought pasta for
the staff dinner.

138
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,221
You give me
ten minutes,

139
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:05,542
I'll whip up a spaghetti carbonara
that'll knock their socks off.

140
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:10,453
Oh, my God!

141
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:12,710
You are a lifesaver!

142
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,832
And, uh, since
it's not on the menu,

143
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:16,270
you can charge
whatever you want...

144
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,420
Say, 20 bucks?

145
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:20,139
For pasta?
Are you crazy?

146
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,288
Won't hurt to ask.

147
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,123
I don't wanna
scare them away.

148
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:24,213
Okay.

149
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:28,661
So...

150
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:29,682
Good news!

151
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:32,793
Our chef is preparing his
special spaghetti carbonara.

152
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:33,750
Oh, yummy!

153
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:35,892
And we're offering
that for $12.

154
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:36,793
Great!

155
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,830
For the appetizer portion.

156
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:40,540
The entrée is $20.

157
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:41,823
-Fine.
-2.

158
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:43,561
22.

159
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:45,183
Okay.

160
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:52,573
Shouldn't there be
an emergency light?

161
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:55,022
Sometimes in these
elevators there's a...

162
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:56,370
Ta-da!

163
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:58,323
Well, aren't you clever?

164
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,350
I'll just call hotel security
and let 'em know we're...

165
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:01,490
No, wait!

166
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,392
This is the first time I've had
you to myself all night.

167
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:05,610
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:06,801
It's those fund-raisers.

169
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:08,633
Everybody wants a piece
of the candidate.

170
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:10,071
What are you doing?

171
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:12,161
Taking my piece.

172
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:15,030
Are you insane?
We're in an elevator.

173
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:16,163
Exactly.

174
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:17,491
Going down...

175
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:19,623
No! Come on.
Cut it out.

176
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,370
The power could come
on at any moment.

177
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,412
I know. That's what
makes it so exciting...

178
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,472
the risk.

179
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:29,701
But I'm kind of running for
mayor here, remember?

180
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:32,941
It's an elevator, silly.
It has an emergency stop button.

181
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:36,060
I don't.

182
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:47,813
Oh, my God, that's amazing!
What are you doing?

183
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:49,611
That's my phone.
It's on vibrate.

184
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,882
Man, I was just
starting to get into it.

185
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,450
Less talking,
more dressing.

186
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:03,572
You two okay?

187
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:05,871
Yeah, fine, thanks.

188
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:10,572
Must've gotten
pretty hot in there.

189
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:13,560
You have no idea.

190
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:25,620
Karen, don't worry
about a thing.

191
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:27,613
I'll collect your mail
till you get back.

192
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,962
Well, how long's this
blackout supposed to last?

193
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:31,993
Well, they say
it may last for days.

194
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:33,172
Days?!

195
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:35,962
Hey, blondie, come here.
Come here.

196
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:39,122
Listen, I don't really need
to go to the hospital.

197
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:39,752
I'm fine.

198
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,500
You fractured a rib,
and you might ve a concussion.

199
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:42,542
You need looking after.

200
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,633
No, some of the stuff in
my freezer might melt.

201
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:47,880
How about I just run out and get some
ice and then meet you at the hospital?

202
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:50,003
Ma'am, you can
replace groceries.

203
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:51,333
You don't understand.

204
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:54,532
Some of my groceries,
they have sentimental value.

205
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:55,750
Sorry.

206
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:57,093
Yeah, well, I don't need
to ask your permission.

207
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,083
Ma'am, no!

208
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,433
Get your hands off me,
you big ape!

209
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:02,992
Get the restraints.

210
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,811
I'm gonna sue your ass!

211
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:18,013
Well, what are we waiting for?
Get me to the hospital.

212
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:19,312
I'm not a well woman.

213
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:24,611
What was that all about?

214
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,633
Your friend's afraid the stuff
in her freezer is gonna spoil.

215
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:30,141
Well, thank God
the power's back on.

216
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:31,912
Now she won't
have to worry.

217
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:54,681
I made you waffles!

218
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,670
Eat 'em while
they're hot.

219
00:11:03,218 --> 00:11:03,790
What?

220
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:06,803
Will you marry me?

221
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,311
They're just toaster waffles.

222
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,742
Ah, that was just the
pre-proposal, actually.

223
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:15,571
The real one will be
much more romantic

224
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,282
with a big diamond
the size of a doorknob.

225
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:18,971
But just so you're prepared,

226
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,360
I do wanna marry you.

227
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:23,721
Well, just so you're prepared,
consider this my pre-refusal.

228
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,293
Come on. What's wrong?
You're wearing my shirts.

229
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:27,111
You burn my breakfast.
You're here every night.

230
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:28,270
It's like we're married already.

231
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,500
We're having a good time.
Why risk ruining it?

232
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:34,821
See, what happened to the thrill seeker
that seduced me in the elevator?

233
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,842
She wouldn't be afraid
of taking a little risk.

234
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,023
Oh, you don't wanna marry her.
She's a tramp.

235
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:40,333
Hold out for a good girl.

236
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,240
No, no, no.

237
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:42,730
I've found what
I'm looking for.

238
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:45,480
Come on. What gives?

239
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,081
Look, Victor...

240
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:53,031
Getting divorced really
kicked my ass.

241
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,410
I'm sorry. Just...

242
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:58,583
Next time I get married,
I've gotta be sure.

243
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:01,451
Okay, I get it.

244
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:04,192
I just wish there was
a way I could prove

245
00:12:04,195 --> 00:12:05,570
how much I love
and ore you.

246
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:08,413
Well, if you canhoke down
that lousy waffle I made you,

247
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:10,023
that'd be a start.

248
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,652
Oh, there's Mike.

249
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,271
Should we see if
he's free Friday night?

250
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:35,651
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

251
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:36,630
Sure.

252
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:40,223
You know what? Do you wanna run
this ice cream side before it melts?

253
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:52,993
Look, Ian is going to come
invite you to dinner Friday,

254
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:55,341
And you are not, I repeat,
not going to accept.

255
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,692
Why is Ian inviting
me to dinner?

256
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:00,852
He wants to thank
you for saving us,

257
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,812
and he wants to show that
he's not jealous of you.

258
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,110
How's that for irony?

259
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,072
I didn't plan to kiss you,

260
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,132
but you didn't exactly resist.

261
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:09,551
I was in shock.

262
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,603
Why were you so upset
when you mentioned Ian?

263
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:14,782
Because we had
just had a fight...

264
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:16,840
about you.

265
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:18,151
Really?

266
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,552
You talk about me a lot?

267
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:22,362
Mike, I am marrying Ian.

268
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:23,612
We have hired a caterer.

269
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:26,812
We are going with the salmon,
so just back off!

270
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:28,011
Hey, Ian.

271
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,430
Hi, Ian.

272
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:30,743
I just asked Mike.

273
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:31,901
He can't make it.

274
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:34,782
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've got plans tonight.

275
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,722
But didn't we say Friday?

276
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:37,943
Friday?

277
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:39,270
Friday I'm wide open.

278
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:41,413
Splendid!

279
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,572
Shall we say 7:30?

280
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:44,933
It's a date.

281
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:57,413
Edie!

282
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:58,443
Mrs. Epstein!

283
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,681
Listen, I'm late for
my Hadassah meeting.

284
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:01,620
Here's the key.

285
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:02,793
Take your time.

286
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,252
Oh, and don't be shy.

287
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:05,782
Check out those closets.

288
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,590
They're very spacious.

289
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:11,400
Edie, what are
we doing here?

290
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:12,643
Checking out a house.

291
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,701
I told you, I'm not looking
to buy right now.

292
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:17,673
Well, who's talking
about buying anything?

293
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:18,792
I...

294
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,303
am giving it away.

295
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:23,970
Edie, we cannot
have sex in here.

296
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:25,500
It's someone else's bed!

297
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:26,440
That's just wrong!

298
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,852
We can't use my place.

299
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,300
We can't use yours.

300
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:32,060
But I'll be damned if I am
gonna pay for a hotel room

301
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,662
when there are all of these
empty houses all over town

302
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,231
that I have the keys to.

303
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:40,460
Though reluctant at first,

304
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,931
Carlos soon saw the
wisdom in Edie's plan.

305
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:47,643
Secret affairs are
a lot like real estate.

306
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:50,221
The three keys
to success are...

307
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:51,610
Location...

308
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:53,491
Location...

309
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:55,520
Location.

310
00:15:00,307 --> 00:15:02,660
Careful. I can't sit
down that fast.

311
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:03,352
Sorry.

312
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:04,693
But it's gonna be worth it.

313
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,813
Okay, so tell Tom the
secret of your risotto.

314
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:11,100
Well, I sauted spinach and
onions in white wine...

315
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:13,071
No, no, the profit margin.

316
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,033
Basically, it costs
a dollar to make...

317
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:17,253
And we charge $20!

318
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:21,231
So four people who would've shared a $15
pizza are now spending 80 bucks.

319
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,123
Okay, kids, dig in!

320
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,030
There's just one little
problem with that, Lynette.

321
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:32,903
Those families you're
talking about have kids,

322
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:36,081
and there's no kid that's gonna
eat anything with spinach in it.

323
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:37,773
Um, Tom...

324
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:45,290
It's delicious, huh?

325
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:48,203
Yeah?

326
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:49,943
Rick learned how to
make this in Italy.

327
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:51,710
Go ahead. Try it.

328
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:53,163
I wanna see
what you think.

329
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:05,712
It's good.

330
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:07,192
It's awesome!

331
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:08,230
It's good.

332
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:11,572
But?

333
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:14,912
But it's just not us.

334
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:15,902
Us?

335
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:17,131
What is us?

336
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:19,303
Look, we're a neighborhood
pizza place.

337
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:20,512
We serve pizza.

338
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:23,113
I like this better.
I'm getting bored of pizza.

339
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:24,941
Porter, the adults are talking.

340
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:28,023
Look, we serve good
food at good prices.

341
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:31,020
We're not looking to be the next,
you know, trendy flash in the pan.

342
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:32,951
That's not what
I'm looking for either.

343
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:35,850
See, my food, it's not trendy.
It's classic.

344
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:36,730
Rick...

345
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:39,801
Obviously you're
a great cook,

346
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:42,311
and when you have your own
place, I will definitely eat there,

347
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,020
but I see no reason
to change my menu.

348
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:51,453
More, please!

349
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,351
Hi! Can I help you?

350
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,670
Yeah, I'm here
to see Mr. Lang.

351
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,600
He's not here.
Is that for him?

352
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:17,212
Yeah.

353
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:19,222
But it's very personal.

354
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,052
Okay.

355
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,921
I don't think I should
leave it with the maid.

356
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,911
Do I look like the maid?
Give me that!

357
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,472
You!

358
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:50,523
Blackmailer!

359
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:52,900
Oh, man, you weren't
supposed tlook!

360
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:01,952
Get off of me!

361
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,853
$50, 000?
Are you insane?!

362
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:08,561
No, that's not for
you to decide!

363
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:11,212
I want all the negatives of those photos,
or I start breaking fingers!

364
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:12,573
No, you can't
break my fingers!

365
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:16,710
Give me the pictures!

366
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,521
Break it up! Break it up!
Come on! Come on!

367
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,442
She's crazy!
She's crazy!

368
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,382
That's for calling me a maid!

369
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,930
He works the hotel
security monitors.

370
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:32,410
That's how he got the photos.

371
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,681
That miserable cockroach.

372
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,770
If you wanna smack
him around a little,

373
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:38,601
I can go inside and
turn up the radio.

374
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:41,572
Again, no, thank you,
but I will need those photos.

375
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:44,183
Oh, no, no, I'm gonna
hang on to these.

376
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:45,593
They're a little revealing.

377
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,343
Ma'am, we can't charge him
without evidence, and if he walks,

378
00:18:48,498 --> 00:18:50,423
he can do what he wants
with the originals.

379
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:53,723
Okay, yeah.

380
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:56,241
But guard them
with your life.

381
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,290
Yeah, especially that one.

382
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:06,020
We've been open for
three months now,

383
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:07,592
and we've barely
turned a profit!

384
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,531
We are building a customer
base! That takes time!

385
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:11,883
Go on, ask her.

386
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:13,982
No, you ask her!

387
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:17,412
Why are you
being so stubborn?

388
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:21,080
And you would rather see the restaurant
fail than succeed with Rick's idea!

389
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:24,263
And I can't believe that you two
are ready to toss out my concept.

390
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,752
You know, why don't you just rename
the restaurant "Lynette and Rick's"?

391
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:28,803
Can we have fudgsicles?

392
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:29,923
-No!
-No!

393
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:35,370
Sorry, Lynette, but the menu is
not changing. End of discussion.

394
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:36,790
I don't think so.

395
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,703
I'm giving it a try.

396
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:42,280
That's not your
decision to make.

397
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:43,260
Yeah?

398
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:46,031
Well, then why don't you come
down to the restaurant and stop me?

399
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,140
Oh, that's right.
You can't.

400
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:53,550
I told you she'd say no.

401
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,290
Ms. McCluskey always
has some fudgsicles.

402
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:01,903
Yeah, but she's
in the hospital.

403
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,191
Where's the ice cream?

404
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,171
She didn't have any.

405
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,832
Oh, man!

406
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:56,431
There wasn't anything
good in there?

407
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,050
No.

408
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:23,461
What the hell
were you thinking?

409
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:26,342
How was I supposed to know the cops were
gonna release the photos to the press?

410
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:29,262
Everybody in town knows the police chief
is the mayor's brother-in-law, everyone!

411
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:30,451
Enough, Jerome!

412
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:33,322
I want you to organize a press conference,
and then I want you to help me prep for it.

413
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:35,971
Well, this is gonna be a bloodbath.
I don't know how you're gonna prep.

414
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:37,711
Just get me a bucket of piranhas,

415
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,013
and I'll stick my head in it.

416
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:48,970
You know, you're a single guy.
Maybe people won't care.

417
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:52,383
I'm running a family values campaign,
and I had sex in an elevator.

418
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:54,373
I think they will care.

419
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,861
Look, I know this is my fault, so if you
wanna bite my head off, go ahead.

420
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:05,022
You know, Gaby, there are only two
things that matter to me these days.

421
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:07,392
My campaign and you.

422
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:09,383
And if I had to
lose one of them,

423
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:11,992
I'd rather it was
the campaign.

424
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,983
Is there anything I can do?

425
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:23,012
Yeah, you can stick
around on election night.

426
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:25,893
I have a feeling I'm gonna
need some serious consoling.

427
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:34,563
God, that is so good!

428
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,861
I know. It's hard
to decide, huh?

429
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:40,623
No. No, I'm gonna go with the crab
cakes and the little quesadillas.

430
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:43,981
Well, all we need is a wedding
cake, and we're done.

431
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:46,202
You are the most decisive
bride I've ever met.

432
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,113
I just guess I'm in a rush.

433
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:51,490
Gotcha.

434
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:54,981
Well, don't worry.
You are not showing at all.

435
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:57,002
No, no, no.
No, I'm not pregnant.

436
00:22:57,006 --> 00:23:00,283
No, I just know know
what I want, which is Ian.

437
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:02,502
So I'm just eager to...

438
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:06,052
you know, not get it over
with, per se, but just to...

439
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:07,490
get to the good part,

440
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:09,010
which is the marriage...

441
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:10,780
to Ian.

442
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:13,021
Seems like a great guy.

443
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:15,131
I don't suppose
he has a brother.

444
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,553
Oh, so you're not seeing anyone?

445
00:23:20,678 --> 00:23:23,123
No, I'm between
disappointments.

446
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:25,371
Well, are you free
for dinner tomorrow?

447
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:27,501
Is this some lame setup?

448
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:28,840
Please say yes.

449
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,510
Well, there's this guy
coming to dinner, and he is

450
00:23:32,836 --> 00:23:35,403
single and handsome
and charming and...

451
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:37,943
You had me at "guy."

452
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,063
So how do
you know him?

453
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:44,071
He's just a neighbor.

454
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,173
Hey, buddy,
whatcha doing?

455
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:54,520
Nothing.

456
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:59,772
You seem a little mopey lately.
Is everything okay?

457
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:01,052
Yeah.

458
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,850
Can we go see
Mrs. McCluskey?

459
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:08,060
You guys didn't have
to come down here.

460
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:11,141
No matter what that C.A.T. scan says,
I'm breaking out tomorrow.

461
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:13,101
Well, Parker really
wanted to come visit you.

462
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,533
I'm gonna put a little
water in these.

463
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:19,981
Don't tell your brothers.
You were always my favorite.

464
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,623
I saw the man
in your freezer.

465
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,422
-Lynette!
-Yeah?

466
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,953
Could you run down to the snack bar
and get me some green jell-o?

467
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:31,183
Oh, sure!

468
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:39,263
Okay, time for a little
grown-up talk.

469
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:51,623
So can you understand now
why I had to do what I did?

470
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:55,402
And how you can never tell
anyone, not even your Mom?

471
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,631
Hey, they didn't have jell-o,

472
00:24:57,635 --> 00:25:00,103
so I hope pudding is okay.

473
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,450
Yeah, let's give it to Parker.

474
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,470
A good boy like him
deserves a treat.

475
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:17,902
What are you thinking about?

476
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,212
Just...

477
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:23,012
this room doesn't
really work.

478
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:25,332
It's just too sterile.

479
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:27,982
Can we go back to that
Spanish colonial on 3rd?

480
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,281
Sure.

481
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:31,913
Fine.

482
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,192
You know what
I was thinking?

483
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,071
I'm really happy,

484
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,843
and I haven't felt this
happy in a long time.

485
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,640
How about you?

486
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:47,123
Are you happy?

487
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:49,771
Oh, my God!

488
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:52,593
Oops, sorry.

489
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:53,970
Bed's not made.

490
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:54,901
Russell!

491
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:56,541
Why don't you check out
the subzero in the kitchen?

492
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,930
It's to die.

493
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:03,052
Well, I see you can't close a sale
without opening something else.

494
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:06,672
Oh, please, I heard about your
open house on holly drive.

495
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,401
They're still disinfecting
the jacuzzi.

496
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:11,850
Slut.

497
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,060
Bitch.

498
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:17,910
You think he's
gonna tell anyone?

499
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:21,651
He's a gay realtor.
He's speed-dialing as we speak.

500
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,043
Then go stop him.

501
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:24,253
What's the big deal?

502
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:26,270
Who cares if people find out?

503
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:27,751
-I do.
-Why?

504
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,151
Are you embarrassed
to be dating me?

505
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:31,731
No! It's...

506
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,232
You know, if Gaby finds out,
she's gonna hit the ceiling.

507
00:26:35,748 --> 00:26:37,071
Why would she care?

508
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,173
She's dating
that Victor guy.

509
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:40,921
Please, that's not gonna last.

510
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:46,193
Oh, my God.

511
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:49,481
You're still in
love with her.

512
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:52,082
No, I just...

513
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:56,383
I mean, we've been getting
along, and don't wanna...

514
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,940
I don't know who
the bigger moron is.

515
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:00,810
You or me.

516
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:04,310
Hey, don't be like this.

517
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:05,960
Look, we're having fun, right?

518
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:08,452
Apparently that's
all we're having.

519
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:09,970
Edie, come on!

520
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,520
No, fun's over.

521
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:20,881
Ah, Mike.

522
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:23,032
Thanks for coming.

523
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:24,430
Thanks for asking me.

524
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:28,000
Susan.

525
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:34,272
Hi.

526
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:35,851
Um, Mike,

527
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,811
I want you to meet
Maggie Gilroy.

528
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,370
I don't believe this.

529
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:48,100
You're setting me up?

530
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:49,711
You need to
move on, okay?

531
00:27:50,238 --> 00:27:51,542
I don't wanna move on.

532
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:52,982
I came here to see you.

533
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,210
Well, I'm not available,

534
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:56,103
so if you feel like
kissing someone tonight,

535
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:57,793
point those lips at Maggie.

536
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:00,931
Here we go.

537
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:03,191
Your beer.

538
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:08,853
Did I mention that Maggie
is an amazing chef?

539
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,410
We're embarrassed to
be cooking for her.

540
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:11,672
Stop.

541
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:14,951
So, Mike, do you have
a favorite type of cuisine?

542
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:21,530
Nah. After three months of prison food,
everything tastes good to me.

543
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:25,911
So you were in prison?

544
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:27,523
He was totally innocent.

545
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,342
Yeah, a woman was
bludgeoned to death,

546
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:32,462
and her blood wound
up on my wrench.

547
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:33,872
Oh, my God.

548
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,500
But he was cleared.
All charges dropped.

549
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:38,580
Here. Eat this.

550
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:40,100
It's just so awful.

551
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:42,853
To go to jail for a crime
you didn't commit.

552
00:28:43,008 --> 00:28:44,312
Oh, it was just a few months.

553
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:46,933
Now my first stretch
for manslaughter...

554
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:48,370
That was brutal.

555
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:55,413
My worst cellmate was
this guy called "Stilts."

556
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:56,681
When they arrested him,

557
00:28:57,415 --> 00:28:59,033
they found a bowl full of ears.

558
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:03,490
I think that was
meant for you.

559
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:04,683
Sorry.

560
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:08,012
So why don't I just go
and brew some coffee?

561
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,883
And I brought a little
surprise for dessert.

562
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,151
Wedding cakes for
you to sample.

563
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:14,453
Great.

564
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,231
Thanks a lot.

565
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:23,433
Now maggie thinks
you're Charles Manson.

566
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:25,593
I don't care. I love you.

567
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:26,721
Don't say that.

568
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:29,252
It's true. I remember
everything now.

569
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:30,393
When I got run over,

570
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:32,130
I was on my way
to propose to you.

571
00:29:32,325 --> 00:29:33,982
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-I do.

572
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:36,713
What would you have said?

573
00:29:39,698 --> 00:29:42,100
You know what I would have said.
It doesn't matter now.

574
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:43,751
The hell it doesn't. Susan,

575
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:46,631
If you can look me in the eye and
tell me that when we kissed,

576
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:48,810
you felt nothing,
then I'll just go.

577
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:51,833
But only if you can say
that and really mean it.

578
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:53,902
Can you?

579
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:58,001
Who wants wedding cake?

580
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:05,743
Maggie, these
cakes are fantastic.

581
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:09,083
Great. Well, all you have to do
is choose one, and we're done.

582
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:10,920
Did you notice the themes?

583
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:11,680
Themes?

584
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:12,581
Yes.

585
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,481
This one is very british:

586
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:16,950
fondant icing and
toffee ganache.

587
00:30:17,626 --> 00:30:20,030
And this is your
classic american:

588
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:22,791
white cake with
buttercream frosting.

589
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:25,173
So which one do
you like the best?

590
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:32,053
Wow. It's kinda
hard to decide.

591
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:34,380
Well, that depends on
what you're looking for.

592
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,350
Rich and elegant?

593
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:40,170
Or down-to-earth
and sweet?

594
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:46,312
I don't know.

595
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:48,031
You want to
taste 'em again?

596
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:49,751
No, I know what
they taste like.

597
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:51,642
I'm just torn, okay?

598
00:30:51,947 --> 00:30:54,291
There's no need to get
upset. It's just a cake.

599
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:57,263
It's not just a cake.
It's a major decision!

600
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:01,571
Well, hey, if you like 'em both so much,
why don't you have two cakes?

601
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:02,681
How would that look?

602
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:04,193
"Oh, hey, everybody!

603
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:05,921
Here's my wedding cake.

604
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:07,510
Oh, and what's that over there?

605
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,482
It's my other wedding cake."

606
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:11,721
I have to pick, and I will!

607
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:14,432
So just stop pressuring me, okay?

608
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:23,093
I'm sorry.

609
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,860
I think I was just having
a little sugar rush.

610
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:35,573
Thanks again, and sorry.

611
00:31:51,027 --> 00:31:53,640
Seriously, just put it on hold
for just a month or two...

612
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:55,910
Excuse me.
Am I interrupting something?

613
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:58,922
No. It's nothing.

614
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:01,481
I think it's time
to level with him.

615
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,632
I just told Susan
I want her back.

616
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:07,463
Excuse me?

617
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:10,123
Look, I know it puts
a crimp in your plans,

618
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,322
and I'm sorry,
but I love her.

619
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:14,852
Well, that's too damn bad, isn't it?
Because she doesn't love you.

620
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:16,203
Really?

621
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:18,123
She didn't seem to mind
when I kissed her.

622
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:19,232
What?

623
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,833
Did he just kiss you?

624
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,682
No. It was days ago.

625
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,473
-And you let him?!
-No! He pounced.

626
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:27,141
It was hardly a pounce.

627
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,681
You bastard. We...

628
00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:30,472
We had an agreement.

629
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:33,681
Susan doesn't have to rry you because
you won her in a game of cards.

630
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:36,950
What, he didn't tell you how
we played poker for you?

631
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:40,812
You bet me in
a game of poker?

632
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,021
It's not how it sounds.

633
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,293
I merely suggested that
if I won the hand,

634
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:47,472
then he would
stop badgering you.

635
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:49,721
And if he won?

636
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:52,802
Well, I forget the exact terms,

637
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:54,983
but the point is, he lost,
as I knew he would.

638
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:56,201
I never would
have wagered you

639
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:57,773
if I didn't have
a very good hand.

640
00:33:01,107 --> 00:33:01,853
Get out!

641
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:03,152
Susan, please.

642
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,613
-You heard her.
-You, too.

643
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:06,263
I've had it with
both of you.

644
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:08,713
You're tugging at me like
I'm some kind of wishbone.

645
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:09,873
You're just upset.

646
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,781
No, I am beyond upset.

647
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:14,640
You two want a decision?
Well, here's what I decide.

648
00:33:14,648 --> 00:33:15,890
There will be no kissing,

649
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:17,510
and there will
be no wedding,

650
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:20,293
and there will
be no damn cake!

651
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:36,493
What's this?

652
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:38,950
Pumpkin sage ravioli.

653
00:33:39,156 --> 00:33:41,373
It's a little thank you for
taking a chance on me.

654
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:44,873
Are you kidding?
I should be thanking you.

655
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:46,742
We took in three
grand tonight.

656
00:33:49,286 --> 00:33:50,611
Candles, too?

657
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:53,171
Yeah, I think we should
use 'em all the time.

658
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,082
It softens up
the ambience.

659
00:33:57,798 --> 00:33:59,392
So, come on. Eat.

660
00:34:08,728 --> 00:34:09,830
Oh, my God.

661
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:13,182
If we serve this for
tomorrow's special,

662
00:34:13,497 --> 00:34:15,141
will will clear four grand.

663
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:16,172
Great.

664
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:18,922
Just be sure
to run it by Tom.

665
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,261
Why? You know
he'll just shoot it down.

666
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:24,541
I mean, I get it.
He's in pain.

667
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:27,593
He doesn't like being sidelined,
but that is no reason to...

668
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,712
You know what?
Let's talk about something else.

669
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:32,992
Yeah, sure.

670
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:37,513
I mean, unless you'd like to go.
You're here so late all the time.

671
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:39,280
No. No, I like being here.

672
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:41,581
It beats going home
to an empty apartment.

673
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,200
Don't you have any friends
to hang out with?

674
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,022
My friends come
in two varieties.

675
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:47,523
The ones I drove away
before I got clean and

676
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:50,072
the ones I should avoid
if I wanna stay clean.

677
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,202
Yeah. I gotcha.

678
00:34:58,815 --> 00:35:00,010
You ever wear
your hair down?

679
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:02,193
What? Yeah.

680
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,560
Sometimes. Why?

681
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,353
It looks really good.

682
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:09,600
You should do
it more often.

683
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:12,052
Oh, well...

684
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:14,272
Thanks.

685
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:26,263
This is delicious.

686
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:27,910
Thanks.

687
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:30,062
Do you want some more wine?

688
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:31,370
Sure.

689
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:40,750
Daddy!

690
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:44,372
The paper has a story
about your restaurant.

691
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:45,513
You're kidding!

692
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:48,693
Well, come here.
What does it say?

693
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:52,963
"When Scavo's pizzeria
opened its doors,

694
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,162
you could almost
hear the city groan,

695
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:58,140
'Just what we need,
another pizza joint.'

696
00:35:58,576 --> 00:36:01,680
But with an updated menu
from new chef Rick Coletti..."

697
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:04,173
Is he the man who
cooked us that really...

698
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:05,933
Yeah, that's the one.

699
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:07,702
What else does it say, honey?

700
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:10,013
"There's more than just
crayons on the table.

701
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,040
The veal piccata is divine,

702
00:36:12,258 --> 00:36:14,433
and the mushroom
risotto is an...

703
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,141
-E-X-Q-U..."
-Exquisite.

704
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:19,860
"An exquisite treat.

705
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:23,480
Scavo's has been transformed
from a mundane family eatery

706
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:25,393
into the area's hottest..."

707
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:27,713
That's enough, Kayla.

708
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:32,193
Daddy's tired.

709
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:34,133
Okay.

710
00:36:54,828 --> 00:36:56,853
Okay, I know you guys
like a good scandal,

711
00:36:56,857 --> 00:36:58,743
but I think the citizens of Fairview

712
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:01,031
are more interested
in the real issues.

713
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:10,240
Mr. Lang, given your
15-point drop in the polls,

714
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,383
what do you have to say
to your constituents?

715
00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:13,873
Well, I would ask them

716
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,470
to not base their view of
me on a single lapse of...

717
00:37:17,475 --> 00:37:20,381
-It's not going very well, is it?
-You picked up on that, did you?

718
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:24,661
Who is she, Mr. Lang?
Give us a name.

719
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,570
No, I will not identify
the woman.

720
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:28,340
What are you hiding?
Is she a prostitute?

721
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:31,233
No! She's not a prostitute.

722
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:34,642
I'll answer questions
one at a time, people.

723
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:41,801
That does it.

724
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:44,070
What are you doing?

725
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:45,920
Gaby, stop, please.
Please, stop.

726
00:37:46,116 --> 00:37:48,121
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

727
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,590
Excuse me.

728
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:54,762
I am the woman
in the photos!

729
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:03,922
What are you doing?

730
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:05,730
Standing by my man.

731
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,352
My name is Gabrielle Marquez,

732
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:15,581
and I want you to know, right
before those photos were taken,

733
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:17,723
Victor asked me to marry him.

734
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:21,910
What did you say?

735
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:24,532
I said, "yes.

736
00:38:24,747 --> 00:38:27,271
I would be thrilled
to be Mrs. Victor Lang."

737
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:31,762
Are you gonna get married?

738
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,072
Have you set a date?

739
00:38:33,086 --> 00:38:34,781
Are you really getting married?

740
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:38,742
In fact, I was so overcome, that when
we were trapped in the elevator,

741
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:40,981
I seized the moment to...

742
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:43,400
express my joy.

743
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,271
So this is a love story?

744
00:38:45,797 --> 00:38:49,170
The only reason Victor kept it
from you was to protect me...

745
00:38:49,837 --> 00:38:53,542
Because he's the kind of man who puts
a woman's honor before his own,

746
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,982
and that's the kind
of man you marry.

747
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:58,931
That's the kind of
man you vote for.

748
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,320
Where are you honeymooning?

749
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:25,202
What's that smell?

750
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:44,151
Ma'am.

751
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:49,762
Are you Karen McCluskey?

752
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:53,732
That little bastard gave
me up, didn't he?

753
00:39:55,337 --> 00:39:58,161
Today, at the mayoral
candidate's press conference,

754
00:39:58,206 --> 00:40:02,653
a woman identified as Gabrielle
Marquez, a former model,

755
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:07,181
surprised reporters by announcing
her engagement to Mr. Lang.

756
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:11,432
The only reason he didn't tell you
was because he was protecting me.

757
00:40:14,016 --> 00:40:14,903
Carlos?

758
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:17,213
I don't know if you've heard...

759
00:40:17,556 --> 00:40:18,133
Yeah.

760
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:20,692
I heard.

761
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:22,380
In a few months,

762
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:25,120
I will be Mrs. Victor Lang.

763
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:40,062
I just heard on the radio the power
company is still having problems,

764
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:42,441
and there might be another
rolling blackout today.

765
00:40:42,878 --> 00:40:45,393
Do you want me to leave Ida's
number in case something happens?

766
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:46,822
I'm sure I'll be fine.

767
00:40:48,338 --> 00:40:49,892
Did you read our
review in the paper?

768
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:52,150
Yep.

769
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:55,933
Okay.

770
00:40:58,175 --> 00:40:58,920
I'm off.

771
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,312
Power.

772
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:27,303
It's the type of thing most
people don't think about...

773
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:31,083
until it's taken away.

774
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:36,660
Whether it's the political
power of the many...

775
00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:45,790
Or a lover's influence
over just one.

776
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:51,663
We all want some sort
of power in our lives,

777
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:56,271
if only to give
ourselves choices.

778
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:03,610
Yes, to be without choices,

779
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:07,201
to feel utterly powerless, well...

780
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,433
It's a lot...

781
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:13,150
like being alone...

782
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:15,020
in the dark.
