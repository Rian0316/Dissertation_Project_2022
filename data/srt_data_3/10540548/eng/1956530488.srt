00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,840
<font color="yellow">It's shit being dead, isn't it?</font>

154
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,240
<font color="white">Yeah.</font>

155
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,560
<font color="yellow">You miss everything.</font>

156
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,400
<font color="white">Yeah.</font>

157
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,560
<font color="white">I'm sorry.</font>

158
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,520
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

159
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,520
<font color="white">For trying to make you the answer.</font>

160
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,760
<font color="white">It's not fair.</font>

161
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,920
<font color="yellow">I've been quite shit, too.</font>

162
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,880
<font color="yellow">I'm really hungry.</font>

163
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,040
<font color="white">Me too.</font>

164
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,760
<font color="yellow">You should have scattered him here.</font>

165
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,200
<font color="yellow">I'm joking.</font>

166
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,720
<font color="white">INTERNALLY:</font><font color="yellow"> I read somewhere that if</font>
<font color="yellow">you want to talk to someone about</font>
<font color="yellow">something important,</font>

167
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,800
<font color="yellow">it's easier if you don't look at</font>
<font color="yellow">them.</font>

168
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,000
<font color="yellow">It's less confrontational, or</font>
<font color="yellow">something.</font>

169
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,760
<font color="yellow">I heard what you said.</font>

170
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,680
<font color="yellow">At the car pound.</font>

171
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,720
<font color="white">What?</font>

172
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,920
<font color="white">INTERNALLY: I knew exactly what.</font>

173
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,760
<font color="white">I love you.</font>

174
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,080
<font color="yellow">I feel the same.</font>

175
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,960
<font color="white">What?</font>

176
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,120
<font color="white">Really?</font>

177
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,480
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

178
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,840
<font color="white">I...</font><font color="yellow"> But I need a lot of time.</font>

179
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,520
<font color="white">OK.</font>

180
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,800
<font color="yellow">And some psychological help.</font>

181
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,600
<font color="white">OK.</font>

182
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,440
<font color="yellow">And I owe my mum about ten grand.</font>

183
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,600
<font color="white">OK.</font>

184
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,480
<font color="yellow">But, yeah.</font>

185
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,200
<font color="white">I love you, too.</font>

186
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,800
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Don't go on about it.</font>

187
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,960
<font color="cyan"># Kiss me each morning</font>

188
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,480
<font color="cyan"># For a million years</font>

189
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,920
<font color="cyan"># Hold me each evening</font>

190
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,200
<font color="cyan"># By your side</font>

191
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,680
<font color="cyan"># Tell me you love me</font>

192
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,120
<font color="cyan"># For a million</font>
<font color="cyan">A million years... #</font>
