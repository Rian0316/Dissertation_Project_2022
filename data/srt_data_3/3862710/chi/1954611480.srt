1
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:03,941
怎么样啊今天...
So, tell me about your day... how's it going

2
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:05,175
粒子探测器弄得如何?
with the particle detector?

3
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:07,478
哇! 你还记得呐?
Wow! You remember that?

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,146
当然 我懂得倾听
Yeah, I listen to what you say.

5
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:10,681
你在用超流体氦
You're building a particle detector

6
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:12,516
搭建一个粒子探测器
using superfluid helium.

7
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:14,518
当你这么说话时
You know, when you talk like that,

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,021
真想把你扑倒在这桌子上
I want to take you right here on this table.

9
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:19,023
以历史经验来看
And you know from past experience

10
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:20,925
这桌子承受不了我们俩的重量
this table cannot support both our weight.

11
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:24,361
探测器到底怎么样啊?
So, how's the detector going?

12
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:26,697
超流体还是很难对付的
Well, it's tricky working with superfluids.

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:27,932
不论你把它们放进什么容器
Whatever container you put them in,

14
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:29,333
他们都会自己
they kind of creep up the sides

15
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:30,834
沿着侧壁爬出来
and crawl out all on their own.

16
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:33,237
有点像Sheldon的蚂蚁农场
Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.

17
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,906
精辟 但是你不会见到一个疯子边跑
Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around,

18
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:39,310
边嚎叫"我喂你糖水 你为什么咬我?"
yelling, "I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me?"

19
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:43,013
这好无聊... 你真想聊这个?
Come on, this is boring... you really want to talk about this?

20
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:43,948
当然了
No, I do.

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,316
这餐巾纸上的"超流体氦"
I... I didn't write "superfluid helium"

22
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:47,117
可不是白写的
on this napkin for nothing.

23
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:49,253
那好吧...
Okay, well...

24
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:50,621
还是挺酷的
This is cool.

25
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:52,957
有一个"超流体真空理论"
Uh, there's a thing called "superfluid vacuum theory",

26
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,959
真空区被想象成一个带着所有
where empty space is imagined as a superfluid

27
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,527
特性的超流体...
with all of its qualities...

28
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,796
粘度 密度 表面张力...
viscosity, density, surface tension...

29
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:03,233
如果你为了戏剧性效果而暂停
Hey, if you're pausing for dramatic effect,

30
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:05,569
那请继续
I'd keep it moving.

31
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,071
不 不
No, no.

32
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,509
一般不讨论表面张力
People don't talk about surface tension.

33
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:15,879
如果把我们的三维空间想象成
If you imagine our three-space as the surface

34
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,582
一个N维超流体气泡的表面...
of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble...

35
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:21,685
这... 太激动人心了
This... is exciting.

36
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:22,920
真是太激动人心了
This is really exciting.

37
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:24,054
我得去找Sheldon
I have to go find Sheldon.

38
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:27,124
好吧 如果你找到他
Okay, well, if you find him,

39
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:28,359
记得扑倒在厨房结实的中岛上...
use the kitchen island...

40
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,294
咖啡桌可受不了你们两个
that coffee table will not support both of you.

41
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:36,066
就是说一个球形的多维度超流体
Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid

42
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:38,435
具有和时空同样的反向能量密度
shows the same negative-energy density as space-time.

43
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:41,238
你怎么看? 怎么看? 你怎么看?
So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?

44
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,410
嗯...
Hmm...

45
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:48,012
怎么? 错了吗?
What? Is it wrong?

46
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:49,513
你在别的地方见过?
Have you seen it somewhere else?

47
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:54,018
嗯...
Hmm...

48
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,120
我知道这不属于我的研究领域
I know this isn't my area,

49
00:01:56,122 --> 00:01:58,288
我数学也没你好
and I could never do the math like you can,

50
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,024
但这想法是不是有戏...?
but could this be something...?

51
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,026
好吧...
Well...

52
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,930
把牛顿的引力常量设成1比较好
You could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one.

53
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:09,299
而且 这些字有股蓝莓的恶臭
And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry.

54
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,202
我最受不了带味道的马克笔了 这你是知道的
You know I can't stand these scented markers.

55
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:15,506
没人让你去舔啊
No one told you to taste them.

56
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:18,475
拜托 这... 这个到底对不对啊?
Come on, is... is this good or not?

57
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:21,578
对
It's good.

58
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,347
- 真的?  - 我喜欢
- Really?  - I like it.

59
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,748
你有戏
I think you're on to something.

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,050
你真这么想? 不是骗我吧?
You do? You're not messing with me?

61
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:27,151
当然不
Not at all.

62
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:29,553
事实上 我为此情此景专门
In fact, I have got something

63
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:30,921
给你准备了个礼物
for just such an occasion.

64
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,022
我原来以为
I was starting to think

65
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,124
永远不会有机会送给你了呢
I might never get a chance to give it to you.

66
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,826
点个赞
Good job.

67
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:43,067
给我一张贴纸?
You're giving me a sticker?

68
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,968
不是一般的贴纸
Not just a sticker.

69
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,572
是一张有猫猫"喵噻!"的贴纸
That is a sticker of a kitty saying, "Me-wow!"

70
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,743
我又不是三岁小孩
I'm not a preschooler.

71
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,478
那好吧 我收回
Fine, I'll take it back.

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,780
这是我赚来的! 别过来!
I earned this! Back off!

还没睡?
You're still awake?

84
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,585
对于一个刚刚发现了
For a man whose last observation was

85
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,153
我们的宇宙可能是
our universe may be the surface

86
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,455
多维度超冷液体的表面的男人来说
of a multidimensional supercooled liquid,

87
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:39,792
"还没睡"是不是有点太"大二症"了
"you're still awake" seems like quite the sophomore slump.

88
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:39,792
{\an8} 通常指高二或大二学生心情低迷的症状

89
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:43,095
你把公式都列出来了
You worked out all the math.

90
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,865
可不止公式
Oh, I did more than work out all the math.

91
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,301
我写了篇论文
I wrote a paper.

92
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,370
你用我的想法写论文?
You wrote a paper on my idea?

93
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:54,407
我用我们的想法写论文
I wrote a paper on our idea.

94
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:57,476
什么时候我的想法变成了我们的想法?
When did my idea become our idea?

95
00:03:57,478 --> 00:03:59,478
当我加入Sheldon佐料
When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness

96
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,848
在我脑中的迷你烤炉中烘烤过之后
and cooked it in the Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

97
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,886
真妙啊
This is good.

98
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,487
我们的想法太妙了
Our idea is really good.

99
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,724
烤炉里的灯泡可是超级亮啊
Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.

100
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,724
{\an8}bright也可译为聪明

101
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:16,162
如果没有其他人想到
You know, if no one's thought of this, yet,

102
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,463
这可是件大事啊
this could be a big deal.

103
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,931
只有上传到预发表服务器
Only way we'll know for sure is

104
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,300
才能确定啊
if we post it online to the pre-print server.

105
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,870
我准备好了 但是你不来我不会发的
I have it ready to go, but I wasn't gonna do it without you.

106
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:29,108
哇 这一切来的太突然了
Wow, it's all happening so fast.

107
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:31,644
我们是不是先睡一觉冷静一下?
Should we just sleep on it?

108
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,313
可以啊 但是我们要冒着
We could, but we always run the risk

109
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,315
被人抢先的风险
of someone else beating us to the punch.

110
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,718
你确定没问题吗?
You're sure it's good?

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,420
我的名字也在上面
My name is right on there with yours.

112
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:44,957
这就是质量的保证
That is a surefire mark of quality.

113
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,594
就像是说"由Joss Whedon导演"
That might as well say "Directed by Joss Whedon".

114
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,059
{\an8}(曾执导复仇者联盟 神盾局)

115
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,366
好 哥们 来吧
Okay, partner, let's do it.

116
00:04:56,236 --> 00:04:57,803
来
Come on.

117
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,739
同我一起点击鼠标
Click the mouse with me.

118
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,511
一...
One...

119
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,013
二...
two...

120
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,247
三...
three...

121
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:09,849
点
Click.

122
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:14,320
我们搞定了
Well, we did it.

123
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:16,355
是啊 我的朋友
Yes, we did, my friend.

124
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,490
你舌头是蓝的?
Is your tongue blue?

125
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:20,393
我不想聊这事
I don't want to talk about it.

126
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,295
电影之夜... 你们想看什么?
Okay, movie night... what do you want to watch?

127
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:25,297
你演的那个猩猩电影到底怎么了?
What happened to that ape movie you were in?

128
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,432
噢上帝
Oh, God.

129
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:27,566
可能是白干了
Probably nothing.

130
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:29,502
我好像在Verizon店门口看到
I think I saw the director twirling a sign

131
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:31,637
导演耍牌子拉顾客来着
outside the Verizon store.

132
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,005
快搜
Search for it.

133
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,040
什么... 别啊
Wha... no.

134
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,007
别! 为什么?
No! Why?

135
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,308
因为肯定很搞笑啊
'Cause it would be fun to watch.

136
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,877
太丢脸了
It would be humiliating.

137
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,446
那现在有两个理由看了
Well, now we have two reasons.

138
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,215
真的有
They have it.

139
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,183
拜托 我们可以看吗?
Please, can we watch it?

140
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,317
求求你啦?
Please?

141
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,720
好吧 但是我告诉你们... 很糟糕
Fine, but I'm telling you... it's terrible.

142
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,122
- 你看过吗?  - 没
- Have you even seen it?  - No.

143
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:51,657
那可能比你想象的要好
Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.

144
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:54,727
香蕉 新鲜的香蕉
Bananas, get your fresh bananas.

145
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,563
果然很糟
It really didn't.

146
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:05,971
Sheldon 这就是超流体氦
Sheldon, this is superfluid helium.

147
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,339
放进嘴里
Put this in your mouth,

148
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,241
会把你舌头冻掉
your tongue will freeze and break off.

149
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:13,813
有蓝莓味吗?
Does it smell like blueberries?

150
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:14,815
没有
No.

151
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,882
那就没事
Then we're probably okay.

152
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:18,818
量子日记的博客提到了
Hey, your paper got mentioned

153
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,319
你们的论文
on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.

154
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,554
真的吗?

要为我们的成果辩护 科学家对峙科学家

说不过他的话
And failing that,

00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,326
就说他母亲饥不择食

Sheldon 我的名字也在论文上
Sheldon, my name's on that paper, too.

188
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,034
这么做没有好处
There's no upside to doing this.

189
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:43,435
他刚又评论了
He just left another comment.

190
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:45,304
他怎么说?
What does it say?

191

"经审查 我改变了主意

它激励了我创造出我自己的理论

你为什么觉得自己会变成杀人魔猩猩
Why do you think you're turning into a killer gorilla

206
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:32,218
而不是正常的猩猩?

207
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,821
因为正常猩猩都是吃素的
Because regular gorillas are vegetarians,

208
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,123
而我刚刚把你接待员的手指咬下来了!

你不觉得太过分了吗?
And you don't think that's too rough?

244
