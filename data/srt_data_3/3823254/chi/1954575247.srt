1
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:04,651
你想用什么颜色啊?
What color would you like to be?

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:07,452
呃 我想选绿的啊 可每次都被你选了
Well, I'd like to be green, but you know you always take it.

3
00:00:07,454 --> 00:00:08,786
才不是咧
That's not true.

4
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:10,455
我用什么颜色都可以的啊
Any color's fine with me.

5
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:13,574
我可以用 蓝色和黄色混合起来的颜色
Yeah, I could be a combination of blue and yellow.

6
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,932
蓝色混黄色就是绿色
Blue and yellow make green.

7
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,650
那就这么愉快的决定了
Well, then it's settled.

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,847
嗨 准备好出发了吗
Hi. Ready to go?

9
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:23,822
哦 告诉你们一个好消息 我们订了午餐外卖

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,445
Sheldon 我们不是说晚上才陪你玩游戏吗

这游戏很容易就玩上八小时的
this game can easily take eight hours.

14
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,251
亲爱的 你真的觉得我们想这样做啊?
Sweetie, you really thought I'd want to do this?

15
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:37,786
- 不啊  - 那你有告诉他吗?
- No.  - Well, did you tell him that?

16
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,672
- 有啊  - 你有大声的说出来告诉他吗?
- Yes.  - Did you say it out loud with words?

17
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,208
没
No.

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,794
我可不想花一整天时间去玩桌游
I don't want to spend the whole day playing a board game.

19
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,762
呃 当你们听到这是全新的拓展版本 
Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear

还包含了哈拉德地区
which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth,

22
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:54,486
你们可能就会改变主意了
now including the Haradwaith Territories.

23
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:58,807
咱俩比一比 看谁先跑回车上去
I will literally race you to the car.

24
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,977

No, no, no, come on, don't leave. Just try it.

25
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,645
不 我们一直都照你们男生想要的去做
No. We're always doing what you guys want.

26
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,148
就一次 要是你们照我们想要的去做就好了
Just once, it'd be nice if you did something we wanted.

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,867
你想用绿色吗?
You want to be green?

28
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,287
你要知道 他们真的有试着去喜欢
You know, they really have tried to like

29
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,673
我们爱玩的的东西了
a lot of the same stuff we're into. 

30
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,908
是啊 我们陪你们打游戏 打电子游戏 看电影
Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,193
还是有导演评论音轨的电影
with director's commentary.

32
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:20,162
我可得说说... 乔治卢卡斯
Oh, my favorite... George Lucas can talk

33
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,214
想怎么说星球大战就怎么说 我说一个字
all the way through Star Wars, I say one word

34
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,498
就被驱逐到厨房去了
and I'm banished to the kitchen.

35
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,635
是啊 今天Amy和我
Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding

36
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:27,886
决定我们所有人要做的事
what we're all gonna do.

37
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,888
行啊 今天你们女生说了算
You got it, you girls are in charge.

38
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,840
- 谢谢  - Sheldon?
- Thank you.  - Sheldon?

39
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,059
好吧
Fine.

40
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,428
现在我们不玩了 你可以选绿色了
Now that we're not playing, you can be green.

41
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,846
- 谢谢啊  - 既然这次你用绿色
- Thank you.  - And since you're green

42
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,065
下次就轮到我了
this time, I can be it next time.

43
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,983
好吧 我想想 有什么有趣的活动
All right, let's see. What's something fun

44
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:44,019
男人们永远不会带我们去做的?
the guys would never take us to do?

45
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,737
哦 我知道了... 我们可以去骑马
Oh, I know... we could go horseback riding.

46
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,988
我不行的
I actually can't.

47
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,108
我的臀部没法展开超过二十二度
My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees.

48
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,330
我骑过一匹很瘦小的
I rode a very thin pony once.

49
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:58,617
就颠了那么一下... 我就掉下来了
On the first bump... just popped right off.

50
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,920
好吧 呃 那你想干什么?
All right, well, what do you want to do?

51
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,706
在Wilshire有个手工艺民间艺术博物馆
There's a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.

52
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,092
让Wilshire去管就好了
Well, that's Wilshire's problem.

53
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,594
拜托 肯定会有一些事
Come on, you know, there... there's

54
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,713
是我们觉得有趣而男人们讨厌的
got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.

55
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,882
等一下 为什么一定要是我们讨厌的啊?
Hang on, why do we have to hate it?

56
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,068
六个字 神秘博士展会
Three words: Doctor Who convention.

57
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,437
我 我没有强迫你去啊
I... I did not force you to go to that.

58
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,556
你戴着土耳其毡帽和蝴蝶领结就出门了
You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. 

59
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,558
我跟着去是确保你不会挨揍
I went so you didn't get beat up.

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,143
我才不会挨揍呢
I wasn't gonna get beat up.

61
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,563
本来是要的 不知怎的我竟然忍住没打
You were, but somehow I held myself back.

62
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,982
你知道你能让我们做什么吗? 滑冰
You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating.

63
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,318
冰冷的空气会让Leonard的哮喘发作
The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma

64
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,287
还正好碰上了我害怕的事
and it plays right into my well-known fear of

65
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,573
被磨冰机磨平
getting flattened by a Zamboni.

66
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,576
现在你是在帮她们想怎样让我们悲剧吗?
Now you're helping them find ways to make us miserable?

67
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,080
抱歉 Leonard 哥生下来就是为了解决问题的
Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, I'm a problem-solver, it's what I do.

68
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,465
我不能去滑冰的
I actually can't go ice-skating.

69
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,919
我有一双超级易碎的脚踝
I have unnaturally brittle ankles.

70
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,338
你身上还有哪个部位是正常的不?
Is there any part of your body that's normal?

71
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:00,395
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 * 
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state  *

72
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:03,898
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,567
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

74
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,320
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

75
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,672
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

76
00:03:10,674 --> 00:03:13,308
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

77
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,343
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

78
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:16,962
生活大爆炸 第八季十二集

00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:28,226
我的天 我的天 我的天
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

82
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:30,888
- 你消停一会行不行?  - 我受不了了 兄弟
- Will you please relax?  - I can't take it, dude.

83
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,889
- 你没事吧?  - 不 我有事 我觉得
- You okay?  - No, I'm not okay. I feel like

84
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,774
内心火烧火燎的
I'm gonna jump out of my skin.

85
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:37,127
我跟你说了不要把下面的毛给脱了
I told you not to wax down there.

86
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,433
再长出来的时候会很痒的
It's itchy when it grows back.

87
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,127
我在担心新视野号空间探测器
I'm worried about the New Horizons space probe.

88
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,178
他在说什么啊?
What's he talking about?

89
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,547
九年前他是那个发射航天器
Nine years ago he was part of a team

90
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,547
到冥王星收集数据的项目团队中的一员
that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto.

91
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:54,002
航天器终于够接近目标了
It's finally close enough, so

92
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:55,936
所以今天早上它自动启动了
this morning it turned itself on.

93
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:56,992
希望它启动了
We hope.

94
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:59,284
信号要走三十亿英里
The signal has to travel over three billion miles.

95
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:02,406
所以要等上好几小时我们才知道它是不是还完好
So it's gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.

96
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:03,898
现在我们看到他这么紧张是因为他担心
Now we get to see him flip out because he's worried

97
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:05,449
航天器会被太空冰块摧毁
it was demolished by space ice.

98
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,482
太空冰块一点都不好笑
Space ice is no joke.

99
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:10,819
我都不敢看冰雪奇缘了
I can't even watch Frozen anymore.

100
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:16,992
哦 交响乐团在市中心演奏贝多芬的曲子
Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.

101
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,627
呃 好吧 在你说同意之前
Yeah, well, before you say yes,

102
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:21,680
{\an8}"贝多芬"也是一部宠物系列电影

103
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:21,680
这不是那部关于大狗狗的电影
it's not the movie about the big dog.

104
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:27,235
我们怎么会想不到一件我们都想做的事呢?
How come we can't think of something we both want to do?

105
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:29,504
因为我们要去做什么 决定权总在你
Because you always pick what we do

106
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:30,889
我只是跟着你去做罢了
and I just go along with it.

107
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:32,307
啊 有意思...
Ah, interesting...

108
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:34,292
你说我们强迫你们去做你不喜欢的事情
We're being accused of making you do things

109
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:35,677
然而你却对可怜的Amy
you don't like, and here you are,

110
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,345
做同样的事
doing the same thing to poor Amy.

111
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,848
你应该指出这样很虚伪
You should point out the hypocrisy of that.

112
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,103
我刚才不就是这个意思吗
That's what I was doing.

113
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:48,990
哦 你说的还不够清楚
Oh, that wasn't clear.

114
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:50,859
再试一次 这次直白点让她理解
Try it again, but this time drive it home

115
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:54,362
比如 "这样你满意了吗 小姐?"
with, "How do you like them apples, missy?"

116
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:56,031
好了 继续想
All right, keep thinking.

117
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:58,417
你把事情搞复杂了
You're making it too complicated.

118
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,468
为什么不从最基本的来?
Why not stick to the basics?

119
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,969
去逛街买衣服
Go shopping for clothes

120
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,421
然后Leonard和我守着你们的包包
while Leonard and I sit in those

121
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:04,923
坐在那些一点都不舒服的椅子上等着 嗯哼?
uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm?

122
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,174
我知道我讨厌这样
I know I'd hate that.

123
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:07,375
Leonard你呢?
Leonard?

124
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,711
嗯 也讨厌
Well, yeah.

125
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:12,881
好的 那么 就这么定了?
Well, then, it's settled?

126
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:14,850
你觉得怎么样? 听起来挺不错
What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.

127
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,451
是不错... 但是让他这么一说
It does... somehow he managed

128
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:19,054
似乎把其中乐趣都说没了
to take all the fun out of it.

129
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,056
好了 再说一遍 哥就是干这行的
Well, once again, it's what I do.

130
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:26,378
还有两小时要等
Oh, another two hours to go.

131
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,063
这么等把我急死了
The wait is killing me.

132
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:30,899
我知道 我懂 我在联盟号太空船
I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule

133
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:33,568
从国际空间站返回 以每小时17000英里
returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth

134
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,737
- 直坠地球之时...  - 先问你一句
- at 17,000 miles per hour...  - Before you finish,

135
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:38,590
你这故事是有关耐心和等待
is this a story about patience and waiting

136
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:41,576
还是又是得瑟你上过太空这回事?
or just another reminder that you went to space?

137
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,914
人家觉得两不误嘛
A story can do two things.

138
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,916
唉 我觉得我都要得心脏病了
Ugh, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.

139
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,918
你在制药公司工作...
You work in pharmaceuticals...

140
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,420
你觉得你能给他开个什么药不?
don't you have anything you can give him?

141
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:55,257
我只有新研制的利尿药
All I have is our new urine flow drug.

142
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:59,678
缓解他的焦虑没啥作用 不过药效很强 他尿尿的时候
Won't help with his anxiety, but it's so strong, when he pees

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,997
就会像装了个喷气包一样满屋子乱飞了
he'll fly around the room like he's got a jet pack.

144
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,518
这事一直在我脑子里转
I can't stop thinking about it.

145
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,354
你担心也没用啊
You know, worrying won't have any effect on what happens.

146
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:12,757
- 我知道  - 也许你可以做点实质性的事
- I know.  - Maybe you need to do something more productive.

147
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,910
好的
Okay.

148
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:16,912
啊
Ah.

149
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:19,815
假如我能准确投入
If I make this shot

150
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,116
那个垃圾桶
in the trash can,

151
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:23,368
说明探测器
the probe will have arrived

152
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,505
会完好无损到达
in perfect working order.

153
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,456
所以 你要不是疯了的话 你就是把你任务的命运
So, in addition to being crazy, you're resting the fate

154
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,760
投注在你的运动天分上
of the mission on your athletic prowess.

155
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,311
是的
Yes.

156
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,881
你能把你的健身脚踏车压坏
The man who crashed his stationary bike.

157
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,301
不是我压坏的 好吗?
I didn't crash it, okay?

158
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:40,886
我播放列表的歌节奏太快
My playlist was too up-tempo,

159
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:43,155
有点上头 所以摔下来了
I got light-headed and I fell off.

160
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,358
好了
Okay.

161
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,910
下面...
It all...

162
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:51,029
就是见证...
comes down...

163
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:52,981
奇迹的时刻
to this.

164
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:58,370
你高兴了吧? 现在可以放心了
You happy? Now you can relax.

165
00:06:58,372 --> 00:06:59,905
你是哪门子科学家? 谁都知道
What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows

166
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:01,489
得三投两中才行
you got to make two out of three.

167
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:11,633
也不算很惨
This isn't so bad.

168
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:13,702
对你来说是挺容易
That's easy for you to say.

169
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:16,538
你的椅子又没对着内衣区
Your chair's not facing the lingerie section.

170
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:20,759
天哪 怎么有那么多内裤
Boy, that's a lot of panties.

171
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:23,762
你们还舒服吗? 可能要等一会
You guys comfy? This might take a while.

172
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:25,263
我不懂为什么女人
You know, I don't understand why women

173
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:27,015
来买衣服
insist on making a big production

174
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:28,466
要这么大阵仗
out of buying clothes.

175
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,185
你说得对 我们应该和你一样
No, you're right, we should do what you do.

176
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:33,538
让我们的妈妈从休斯顿的沃尔玛寄裤子过来
Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.

177
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:36,191
他们那有个人
They have a man there

178
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:38,410
知道我的个人风格
who understands my personal style.

179
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:40,829
等会见
Bye.

180
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:43,031
呃 我有个坏消息
Uh, I've got some bad news.

181
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,983
这里没有无线
There's no cell service in here.

182
00:07:44,985 --> 00:07:46,918
哦
Oh.

183
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,620
好吧 没事
Well, that's all right.

184
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:50,538
智能手机发明之前
There were plenty of ways to pass the time

185
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,340
人们也有无数种方法消磨时间
before smart phones were invented.

186
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:53,909
说的没错
That's true.

187
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:55,961
我来拿手机查一下
I'll look them up.

188
00:07:58,614 --> 00:08:01,216
特喵的
Son of a biscuit.

189
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,184
Sheldon 没事的
Sheldon, it's fine.

190
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:04,469
不 谁说没事
No, it's not fine.

191
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:05,921
哪门子21世纪的商场
What kind of store in the 21st century

192
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:07,389
连个无线都没有?
doesn't at least have Wi-Fi?

193
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:08,857
我要打给他们公司办公室...
I'm going to call their corporate office...

194
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,609
他喵了个咪的!
Son of a biscuit!

195
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,892
瞧好了 我的军队
Let's see, my armies

196
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:25,359
要从雄鹿地
are going to attack the Shire

197
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:26,512
去攻击夏尔
from Buckland.

198
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:28,638
我来扔骰子...
And I roll...

199
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:35,228
一个5 一个3
a five and a three.

200
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,646
好的
Okay.

201
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:41,150
我要防御 扔骰子...
And to defend, I roll...

202
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:43,319
两个6 我赢了
two sixes. I win.

203
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:46,572
天哪 又是两个六
Boy, double-sixes again.

204
00:08:46,574 --> 00:08:48,041
要不是我亲眼见到
You know... if I hadn't seen it

205
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:49,876
我都难以置信
with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it.

206
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:54,330
我想知道我们还要在这等多久
I wonder how long we're gonna be stuck here.

207
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:55,999
我不知道 但是她们为我们付出了好多
I don't know, but the girls do a lot for us.

208
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,383
至少这是我们能做的
It's the least we can do.

209
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,385
说得对 我觉得这才公平
Oh, that's true. I suppose it's only fair

210
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:00,953
我们互相妥协
we make compromises.

211
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:03,389
瞧你 这么成熟了
Look at you, being all mature.

212
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:07,477
我不明白你怎么这么惊讶
I don't know why you're so surprised.

213
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,228
和你住在一起这么多年 让我懂得了一件事
If there's one thing I know about after living with you

214
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,181
就是怎么妥协让步
for so many years, it's how to compromise.

215
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,101
等... 等一下?
I-I'm sorry?

216
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:17,236
你对我妥协让步?
You make compromises for me?

217
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:20,506
一直都是
All the time.

218
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:23,343
在这地球上?
On Earth?

219
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,864
在我们的生活里?
In our lives?

220
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:31,534
在...我们过的日子里?
That... That we're living?

221
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:34,037
是的 我...
Oh, yes. I...

222
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,123
就说昨天吧 午饭的时候 你的牙齿里卡了
Just yesterday, you had a-a big piece of lettuce

223
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,758
一片巨大的生菜
stuck in your teeth at lunch.

224
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,245
我说什么了吗? 没有
Did I say anything? No.

225
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,264
我妥协了
I compromised

226
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:47,600
把我的嘴巴闭得紧紧的
and kept my mouth shut.

227
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:51,220
你也应该这么做 因为当时所有人都在嘲笑你
Like you should've, because everyone was laughing at you.

228
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:54,223
那才不是妥协
That is not a compromise.

229
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,225
妥协是我开车送你去各种地方
A compromise is me driving you everywhere

230
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:57,894
因为你自己不愿意学车
because you refuse to learn how.

231
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:00,279
哦 我已经学会了 Amy教我的
Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.

232
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:02,281
什么? 那... 那你为什么不开车?
What? Then... Then why don't you do it?

233
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:05,485
呃 因为开车很吓人
Uh, well, it's scary.

234
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:09,455
有时候我会把刹车和油门搞混
And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up.

235
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:13,409
但是 更重要的是 开车送我上班
But, more importantly, driving me to work

236
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,162
是你人生的意义所在
is one of the things that gives your life purpose.

237
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,749
我不能把它从你那里夺走
I can't take that away from you,

238
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,585
所以说... 我能做什么呢?
so... what do I do?

239
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:26,556
哦 拜托 我都快把答案告诉你了
Oh, come on, I'm practically feeding you the answer.

240
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:29,375
我妥协了
I compromise.

241
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:35,098
- 嘿 呃 谢谢你陪着我  - 我很乐意
- Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.  - I'm happy to.

242
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,600
我想出来走走对你有好处
I think getting out of the apartment will do you good.

243
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:40,269
那么... 我们去哪里?
So... where we headed?

244
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,772
如果你不介意的话 我想去寺庙
If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.

245
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:47,410
兄弟 相信我 你不会想成为一个犹太教徒的
Buddy, trust me, you don't want to convert to Judaism.

246
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:49,946
我知道我表现得好像它很酷
I mean, I know I make it look cool,

247
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:54,750
但... 这也不是什么特别有趣的事
but... it's not all briskets and dreidels.

248
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:57,203
我是说去一个印度教的寺庙
I meant a Hindu temple.

249
00:10:57,205 --> 00:11:00,206
哦 好吧
Oh. Okay.

250
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,758
那里不会像夺宝奇兵里演的那样 对吧?
It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right?

251
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,762
不会有什么拿着号角的光头把我的心脏撕裂吧
Some bald guy with horns isn't gonna rip my heart out.

252
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:09,098
哥们 那电影只是一些帝国主义的幻想
Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy

253
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,552
把如此一个美丽又和平的宗教的信徒
that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion

254
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,937
描绘成一群嗜血的野蛮人
look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.

255
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:15,855
你爱那个电影
You love that movie.

256
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:18,524
是啊 它是很好看
Yeah, it's pretty great.

257
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,147
看到你突然变得那么虔诚我有点吃惊
I'm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.

258
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,481
为什么?
Why?

259
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:28,151
呃 因为我已经认识你10年了
Well, because I've known you for ten years

260
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:29,869
你从来没有去过寺庙
and you've never gone to temple,

261
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,737
你从来没有谈过相信上帝
you never talked about believing in God,

262
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:35,958
上个光明节的时候我还看到你在一个巴西牛排屋
and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow

263
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,162
吃了两磅的神牛肉
at a Brazilian steak house.

264
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:41,998
宗教是一件很私人的事情
Religion is a very personal thing.

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,550
我的确去寺庙... 我只是... 从来不谈这件事
I do go to temple... I just... I don't talk about it.

266
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,085
是啊 但是你是科学家
Yeah, but you're a scientist.

267
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:47,220
所以呢?
So?

268
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:48,638
所以说 作为一个科学家 你相信
So, as a scientist, you believe the way

269
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,673
理解宇宙要靠事实和证据
to understand the universe is through facts and evidence,

270
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:51,757
现在你指望
and now you're counting

271
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,426
一个全身蓝色
on some blue chick

272
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:55,678
三头六臂的妹子来帮你?
with a hundred arms to help you?

273
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,097
这太冒犯人了 你对印度教
That is so offensive. Does everything you know

274
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,682
的所有了解 都来自于夺宝奇兵吗?
about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?

275
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:02,902
当然不是 还有辛普森一家
No. There's also Apu from The Simpsons.

276
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:07,573
好吧 很多的科学家都相信神灵
Well, lots of scientists believe in God.

277
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:10,359
好吗? 有牛顿 呃 法拉第
Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday,

278
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,078
呃 帕斯卡... 他们都是信徒
uh, Pascal... all were believers.

279
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,914
就算爱因斯坦也曾经攻击量子理论
Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory

280
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,250
根据是"上帝不会靠掷色子
on the grounds that "God does not play dice

281
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:18,584
- 来控制宇宙  - 呃 他当然
- with the universe."  - Well, of course

282
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:22,371
相信上帝... 他和玛丽莲・梦露上床了
he believed in God... he slept with Marilyn Monroe.

283
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,207
其实这件事没有证据
Actually there's no proof of that.

284
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,709
你相信你的宗教 我相信我的
You believe in your religion, I'll believe in mine.

285
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,180
怎么样了?
How's it going in there?

286
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,215
呃
Eh.

287
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:35,051
这件衣服不太适合穿去上班
Not really a great outfit for work,

288
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:39,639
除非妓女和婊子部又有什么新的职位空缺
unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division.

289
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:42,558
- 嘿 我能问你一件事吗  - 当然可以
- Hey, can I ask you something?  - Sure.

290
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,311
我真的经常强迫你做一些你不想做的事吗?
Do I really force you to do things you don't want to?

291
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,230
是啊 但是没关系
Yeah, but it's okay.

292
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:48,564
怎么会没关系呢?
How is it okay?

293
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,900
我向自己保证过 如果我有朋友
I promised myself, if I ever got friends,

294
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:52,985
他们说什么我都会做
I'd do whatever they said.

295
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:57,406
真的 我很庆幸在遇到邪教之前遇到了你
Really, I'm lucky you found me before a cult did.

296
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:00,243
呃 那是很久之前的事了
Well, you know, that was a long time ago.

297
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:03,045
你现在已经是另一个女人了 你很聪明
You're a different woman now. You're smart,

298
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:05,715
你有很多好朋友 你还有一个男朋友
you've got great friends, you've got a boyfriend,

299
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:09,752
你很漂亮 你完全不懂时尚 但...
you're pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but...

300
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,088
总之 今晚我们做你想做的事
Anyway, tonight we're gonna do whatever you want.

301
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,256
真的吗?
Really?

302
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:15,308
当然 你说什么我们就做什么
Absolutely. You name it, we're doing it.

303
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:19,645
我们去手工艺博物馆织篮子
Basket weaving at the craft museum.

304
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:23,266
既然你已经说了
Well, you named it.

305
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:28,988
哦 还有一件事
Oh, here's another one.

306
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,992
我希望那些苹果煎饼粉放在橱柜的顶层隔板上
I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf

307
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:34,610
因为它的开头字母是A
because it starts with an "A,"

308
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:36,445
但我没有把它放在那里
but I don't put it there

309
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,698
因为我不希望你在为我做早饭的时候
because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs

310
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,933
把你可爱的小短腿给摔断了
when you're supposed to be making my breakfast.

311
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:46,455
现在轮到我来说 我做出的妥协了吗?
Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?

312
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:50,843
我还没说完 不过你说吧
I wasn't done, but go ahead.

313
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:54,463
他妥协地说道
He said, compromising.

314
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:56,465
因为你 我不能
Because of you, I'm not allowed

315
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,467
调节我自己家里的气温
to adjust the temperature in my own home.

316
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,019
我不能吹口哨
I'm not allowed to whistle.

317
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,305
我不能穿会发出声音的鞋子
I don't wear shoes that might squeak.

318
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:04,974
呃 你是一个物理学家 不是个马戏团的小丑
Well, you're a physicist, not a circus clown.

319
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:09,295
Sheldon 你没有意识到我因为你都没法和我爱的女人
Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with the woman I love

320
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:10,813
住在一起吗?
because of you?

321
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:13,449
没有别的原因 就是因为你
No other reason. Just you.

322
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,818
- 这是真的吗?  - 是啊 真的 上一次
- Is that true?  - Yes, it's true. The last time

323
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,153
我提起这件事的时候 你情绪崩溃
I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown

324
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:20,206
跳上一辆火车逃跑了
and got on a train and ran away.

325
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,991
呃 考虑到我在这件事上的经历
Well, given my history on the subject,

326
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,827
现在提起它好像有点不顾后果
it seems a little reckless to bring it up now.

327
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:29,165
你完全无法想象你给你身边的人造成了
You have no idea how much you inconvenience

328
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,716
多少的不方便
the lives of everyone around you.

329
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:32,668
真是累死了!
It's exhausting!

330
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,170
你知道吗?
You know what?

331
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,172
你以为你那么宽容
You think you're so tolerant,

332
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,090
但事实是...
but the truth is...

333
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:40,176
你经常对我态度恶劣
you're mean to me a lot.

334
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:41,677
好吧 你以为
Yeah, you think

335
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,346
我注意不到那些讽刺我的评价
that I don't notice all those sarcastic comments

336
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:45,731
和你们的白眼 其实我注意到了 知道吗?
and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm?

337
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,184
我的余光看得很远
I have excellent peripheral vision.

338
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:53,406
运气好 我都能看见我的耳朵
On a good day, I can see my ears.

339
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:57,243
Sheldon 我... 我很抱歉伤害到了你
Sheldon, I... I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

340
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,079
我只是忍这些忍得太久了
I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.

341
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,747
我也很抱歉 而且要是你想和Penny
Well, I'm sorry, too. And if you want

342
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:04,383
同居的话 我也没有意见
to live with Penny, then I think you should.

343
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:05,868
你真的同意了?
Do you mean that?

344
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,204
是啊 穿上你那双声音超大的鞋...
Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and...

345
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:10,723
离开我的生活吧
your way out of my life.

346
00:15:13,493 --> 00:15:15,511
别这样 别难过啊
Come on, don't get upset.

347
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,713
我才没有难过
I'm not upset.

348
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:22,768
我只是在想象一个没有我最好的朋友的世界
I'm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.

349
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,221
哦 Sheldon
Sheldon.

350
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:26,222
没关系的
It's okay.

351
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:29,058
我... 我并不是要离开你的生活
I... I'm not leaving your world.

352
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,894
我只是说住到对门去而已
I'm just talking about living across the hall.

353
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:33,212
我懂的
I understand.

354
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,815
不管怎样 我希望你知道...
Either way, I want you to know that...

355
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,883
我明白自己是个多难缠的人
I'm aware of how difficult I can be.

356
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:39,568
所以我只想说...
So I just want to say...

357
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,789
谢谢你容忍我这么多年
thank you for putting up with me.

358
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,125
兄弟...
Buddy...

359
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,213
你们在这里待得怎么...?
How are you guys getting alo...?

360
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,532
什么情况? 怎么还哭了?
What? Why are there tears?

361
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:55,201
没事的
Everything's fine.

362
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,920
我们就是聊了聊搬家的事
We just started talking about living arrangements.

363
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:01,590
你疯了吗? 你明知道他想走就走
Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.

364
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:05,561
我是这么说的啊
That's exactly what I told him.

365
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,596
Sheldon 我们知道这个话题很敏感
Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject,

366
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,932
在你准备好之前 Leonard绝对不会搬走的
and Leonard's not gonna move out until you're ready.

367
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:14,920
好吧 你可以一点一点慢慢让我适应嘛?
Well, what if you did it gradually?

368
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:17,907
好啊...
All right. Well...

369
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:21,243
先从我一周和Penny住两天开始
how about we start with two nights a week

370
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,745
怎么样?
I live with Penny?

371
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:26,882
可不可以一周和她住一晚...
How about one night and...

372
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,951
但我让你吹口哨?
I let you whistle?

373
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,473
好吧
Okay.

374
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:36,308
而且得是我不在家的时候
When I'm not home.

375
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:39,411
听你的
You got it.

376
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,298
看到没
There we go,

377
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,967
又是我做了妥协
compromising again.

378
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:48,020
我们真是好室友
We really are the best.

379
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:57,146
就是这里啦
Here we go,

380
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,814
这是我第一次来印度教寺庙
my first Hindu temple.

381
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:01,333
你看见喷泉后面那座看起来像是
You see behind the fountain, that tower

382
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,152
金字塔的建筑了吗?
that looks like a pyramid?

383
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:05,154
那是希诃罗 象征着
It's called a Sikhara. It symbolizes

384
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:08,073
人类通往天堂的路
the connection between the human and the divine.

385
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,074
哦哦
Huh.

386
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,377
我还以为那是打小高尔夫球的地方呢
I always thought it was mini golf.

387
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,213
好了 我们下车吧?
All right. Shall we?

388
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:17,967
好啊 不过进去之前 有没有什么其他
Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know

389
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,301
我需要注意的事情?
before I go in?

390
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:20,469
比如说?
Like what?

391
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:23,322
比如我穿成这样好吗?
Like am I dressed okay?

392
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,341
什么? 你去其他地方的时候
Really? So every other place you've been,

393
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:27,643
你都没觉得不好?
you thought this was fine?

394
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:30,479
我知道你现在压力很大
I know you're under a lot of pressure,

395
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:31,814
所以我就不跟你吵了
so I'm gonna let that pass.

396
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,599
抱歉 你说得对
Sorry. You're right.

397
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,484
我压力太大了
I'm so stressed.

398
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:37,286
但是你知道吗
But you know what,

399
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:39,488
每次我走进寺庙
whenever I walk into that temple

400
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,857
我都会觉得 无论发生什么 都没那么重要
I realize that whatever happens, it's okay.

401
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:44,026
我们是无限空间的一部分
We're all part of an immense pattern,

402
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,862
尽管我们无法理解它 我们却很开心
and though we can't understand it, we can be happy to know

403
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:49,415
这个空间的运行也依赖着我们
that it's... it's working its will through us.

404
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,451
这样也很好
That's nice.

405
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:54,720
无论你说是上帝还是宇宙还是个体
Whether you call it God or the universe or the self,

406
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:58,040
我们都是互相联系的 这样很好...
we're all interconnected, and that's just a beautiful...

407
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:01,844
混蛋! 那货刚碰了我车!
Son of a bitch! That guy just dinged my car!

408
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,130
你... 你想什么呢?
S... Seriously?

409
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:06,882
你... 你就打算这么开走嘛?
Y... You were just gonna drive away?

410
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:08,183
就像我的生活
Like my life

411
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:09,635
还不够惨似的
isn't hard enough right now.

412
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:12,304
一个宇宙探测器可能会毁掉
A space probe might be destroyed,

413
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,306
我父母正在撕破脸离婚
my parents are going through an awful divorce,

414
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:17,776
给我的狗狗剃毛的人给它剪了个刘海!
the guy who cuts my dog's hair just gave her bangs!

415
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:19,895
嘿 Raj
Raj.

416
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:23,232
你也看见了 她就像阿呆与阿瓜里面的金凯利!
You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber!

417
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,885
Raj 你有条短信
Raj, you just got a text.

418
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:28,153
探测器开启了 一切顺利
The probe turned on. It's fine.

419
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:31,657
哦 太好了
Oh, good.

420
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:35,294
合十礼 爷爷您好
Namaste, Grandpa.

421
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:45,421
我还以为这会很无聊呢
I thought this was gonna be boring,

422
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:47,089
不过好像还挺好玩的
but it's actually kind of fun.

423
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:51,093
别跟Amy说 不过咱们以后每周日都得来了
Don't tell Amy that. We'll be here every Sunday.

424
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:53,762
Sheldon 这个篮子编的真好
Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.

425
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:55,564
这不是篮子
It's not a basket.

426
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,984
这是十六世纪中国士兵戴的头盔
It's a soldier's helmet from 16th century China.

427
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,023
真好
Very nice.

428
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:07,109
是啊 看起来棒呆了
Yeah, it looks great.

429
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,597
我看见你的表情了
I saw that.

430
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:25,345
虽然一周只能和你做一天室友
Well, roomie, it's only one night a week,

431
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,531
不过这也是个很好的开始啦
but it's a start.

432
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,500
我知道 我真的觉得Sheldon很棒
I know. I'm really proud of Sheldon.

433
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,418
是啊 我也这么觉得
Yeah, I'm proud of him, too.

434
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,037
你们能小点声吗? 屋里有人
Can you keep it down? Some of us

435
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,838
要睡觉了
are trying to sleep out here.
