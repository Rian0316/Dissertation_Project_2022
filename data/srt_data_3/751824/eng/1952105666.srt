1
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:10,621
Bernard. Minister not in yet?

2
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:12,695
He's in his office,
having a meeting.

3
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,092
What about?

4
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:15,936
Nothing very important.

5
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:17,298
I see.

6
00:01:17,464 --> 00:01:20,262
And whatwas that meeting
in there yesterday?

7
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:23,103
He was just reviewing
procedures for briefing him

8
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:25,573
on answers
to Parliamentary questions.

9
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:30,615
But there were Principals present
and other assorted underlings.

10
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:34,943
Just the ones who supply him
with the information, actually.

11
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:37,823
Bernard, this has to be stopped
at once.

12
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:38,984
Why?

13
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:42,739
Lfhe talks to the underlings,
he may learn things we don't know.

14
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:48,057
- Ourposition could be undermined.
- If it increases ourknowledge...

15
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:51,534
It is folly if it's at the expense
of your authority.

16
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:52,704
Why?

17
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,620
Bernard, please stop saying why.

18
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:56,864
Why?

19
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:01,144
I mean, could you develop
that point please?

20
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:06,095
Would you say that the Minister
is starting to run the Department?

21
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:09,177
Yes, things are going pretty well,
actually.

22
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:12,700
No, when a Ministeractually
starts to run his Department

23
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,820
things are not going pretty well.

24
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:16,861
They are actually
going prettybadly.

25
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:19,902
But actually... er... I mean, in fact,

26
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:22,658
isn't it the Minister's job
to run the Department?

27
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:24,462
No, Bernard, it is ourjob.

28
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:26,581
Orto be more precise,
it is my job,

29
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:29,702
forwhich I've had 25 years
experience and training.

30
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:33,379
Don't you realise whatwould
happen if the Ministerruns it?

31
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:34,544
No, what?

32
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:36,934
First, there would be chaos,
naturally.

33
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:39,664
And second,
which is much more serious,

34
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,655
there would be innovations.

35
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:43,098
Changes, Bernard.

36
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,141
Public debate.
Outside scrutiny.

37
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:46,817
Is that what you want?

38
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:51,456
Good heavens, no.
But what should he do then?

39
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:54,134
A Ministerhas three functions.

40
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,942
First, as an advocate,

41
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:58,777
making the Department's actions
seem plausible

42
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,141
to Parliament and public,
he is ourpublic relations man.

43
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:04,818
Second, he is ourman
in Westminster,

44
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,021
steering our legislation
through Parliament.

45
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:10,618
And third, he is ourbreadwinner.

46
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:13,857
He has to fight in Cabinet
forthe money we need

47
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,662
to run our Department.

48
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:19,302
But, he is not here to review
departmental procedures

49
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,534
with Principals
and Assistant Secretaries.

50
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,172
- But ifhe's go the time.
- Why has he got the time?

51
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:27,017
He shouldn't.
That's yourfault, Bernard!

52
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:29,653
You must ensure
he hasn't got the time.

53
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:32,022
Create activity, Bernard!

54
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,692
He should be making
speeches, visits.

55
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:36,900
We need deputations,
junkets abroad,

56
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:40,943
mountains of red boxes, we need
crises, emergencies, panics!

57
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,858
- Pull yourself together, Bernard.
- Yes, but...

58
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,697
- You leave spaces in his diary?
- No, he makes those.

59
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:48,616
- Fill them up.
- He won't let me.

60
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:50,456
Don't ask him. Do it.

61
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,693
Make sure he spends more time
where he can't do any damage.

62
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:58,493
- But where?
- The House of Commons, for instance.

63
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:02,456
I really do try my best.
There's a deputation in there.

64
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:04,774
What is it about, Bernard?

65
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:09,335
Something completely trivial,
preserving badgers in Warwickshire.

66
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:12,535
Well done, Bernard.

67
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:16,815
Why didn't you tell me this
when I asked you before?

68
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:19,937
Actually, I thought
itwas rathertrivial.

69
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:23,016
I didn't think
you would approve, actually.

70
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:24,936
Bernard.

71
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:29,858
I'll try and find some more
threatened species then, shall I?

72
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:32,333
You may not have to look veryfar.

73
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:36,378
Secretaries who can't occupy their
Ministers are a threatened species,

74
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:40,458
actually.

75
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:46,623
We have a sacred trust
to preserve ournatural heritage.

76
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:50,060
That's what this new legislation
is designed to ensure.

77
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:53,614
As I said in the House,
the system simply isn'tworking.

78
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:55,297
It's a hotch- potch.

79
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,734
Local authorities,
tourist authorities,

80
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:01,180
national parks,
countryside commision, C. P. R. E.

81
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,653
Nobody knows where they are,
nothing gets done.

82
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,894
They're all back biting
and buck passing.

83
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:07,736
You know
what committees are like.

84
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,337
We are a committee.

85
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:13,583
Yes. I didn't mean
yoursort of committee.

86
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:17,737
But this new legislation is
designed to create clearauthority,

87
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:20,372
and save a great deal
of public money.

88
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:24,332
- You ought to welcome it.
- But what about Hayward's Spinney?

89
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:28,417
Afew very small areas will lose
theirspecially protected status,

90
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:31,098
because it isn't economical
any longer,

91
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,334
to maintain them
as they ought to.

92
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:36,302
Hayward's Spinney is
a vital part of ourheritage.

93
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:38,853
The badgers have dwelt there
forgenerations.

94
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:42,380
- Can you be sure of that?
- It said so in The Guardian.

95
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:43,693
Ah, well...

96
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:49,373
Actually it says that the badgers
have dwelt there forgenerations!

97
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:53,456
Howwould you feel if you had

98
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:56,058
a lot of office blocks
built overyourgarden

99
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:57,816
by a lot of giant badgers?

100
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:00,544
But a lot of office blocks...
giant badgers?

101
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:04,218
There's nothing special
about man, Mr. Hacker.

102
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,296
We're not above nature.
We're all a part of it.

103
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:09,341
Men are animals too, you know.

104
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:12,416
Yes, I've just come from
the House of Commons.

105
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:16,420
Sorry, Minister, you are due
foryournext appoinment.

106
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,858
Oh, what a pity.

107
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:21,061
Thank you forputting
yourcase so persuasively.

108
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:22,657
It's been a pleasure.

109
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:25,099
Left at the corridor
and down the stairs.

110
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:28,134
But whatwill you do about it?

111
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,421
All views will be taken
into consideration.

112
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,774
Now if you'll excuse me...

113
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,173
Very polished performance.
Gracious.

114
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:42,062
And said nothing.
Very professional.

115
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:44,533
- Why wasn't I warned?
- About what?

116
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,581
That unifying the administration

117
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:50,054
would remove protected status
from this beaverwhatsit?

118
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:53,455
Badgercolony. Hayward's
Spinney, East Warwickshire.

119
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,421
Somebody
must have know about it.

120
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,336
If somebody did happen to know,

121
00:06:57,504 --> 00:07:00,860
they wouldn't necessarily know
that you wanted to know

122
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:03,663
what they happened to know,
in case...

123
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:06,623
- Ah! Sir Humphrey!
- Humphrey!

124
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:08,263
Good morning, Minister.

125
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:11,734
Is it yourjob to help Ministers
make fools of themselves?

126
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:14,020
I have nevermet one
that needed any help.

127
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:17,542
No, it is the last thing...

128
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:21,743
Why did you encourage me to say
that unifying the administration

129
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:25,340
meant no loss of amenity,
when I've signed a death warrant

130
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,142
fora whole army ofbeavers?

131
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:28,862
- Badgers, Minister.
- What?

132
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:30,696
Beavers would have a navy.

133
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:36,495
- Why did you let me do it?
- I did not encourage you to say that.

134
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,814
You did!
The Department prepared this.

135
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,538
- "No loss of amenity", it says.
- No.

136
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,776
- "No significant loss of amenity".
- Same thing.

137
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,014
There's all the difference
in the world.

138
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:50,176
Almost anything can be attacked
as a "loss of amenity",

139
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,780
and be defended as
"not a significant loss of amenity".

140
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:57,175
One should appreciate
the significance of"significant".

141
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:59,102
Well, be that as it may,

142
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:01,380
any publicity would be
very damaging.

143
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:02,977
Oh, I think not.

144
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:05,704
But if there is a loss of amenity...

145
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:08,253
If you'd approve this release,
you would see

146
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:10,733
that it does counter
all theirarguments.

147
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:14,658
It points out that the spinney
is deregistered, not threatened.

148
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,941
Badgers are very plentiful
all overWarwickshire.

149
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:20,060
And it points out the connection

150
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:22,533
between Badgers
and brucellosis.

151
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:26,493
"Cannot be regarded
as a significant loss of amenity".

152
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:29,459
So this might not get
into the National Press?

153
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:33,333
Afew lines on The Guardian.
Nothing to worry about.

154
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:36,333
Only the urban middle class
worry about

155
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:40,941
the preservation of the countryside,
because they don't live in it.

156
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:44,059
- Would that be all, Minister?
- Yes!

157
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,896
No, this may well blow over,

158
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:48,498
but it doesn't answer
my basic question.

159
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:51,861
- Which was?
- Why wasn't I told about it?

160
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:56,336
There are those who have argued
and indeed cogently

161
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:59,177
that on occasion
there are some things

162
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:01,778
it is betterfora Minister
not to know.

163
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:03,502
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,973
Minister, youranswers
in the House

165
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,374
and at the Press Conference
were superb.

166
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,217
You were convincing.
The critics were silenced.

167
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,182
But could you have spoken
with the same authority

168
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:18,098
if the ecological pressure group
had been badgering you?

169
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:22,220
But I have a right to know!
I am the people's representative!

170
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:25,456
What right have you got
to withhold this information?

171
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:29,253
- It's in yourown best interests.
- What do you mean?

172
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:32,143
It's outrageous!
It must not occuragain.

173
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:35,262
I've a plan forthe reorganising
of this Department

174
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,380
which would ensure
that it doesn't.

175
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,296
- Indeed?
- Yes, indeed.

176
00:09:39,464 --> 00:09:41,022
If I had one UnderSecretary

177
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:43,937
and two Assistant Secretaries
reporting to me...

178
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:46,937
- Minister. Please!
- Let me tell you my plan.

179
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:48,662
The plan is immaterial.

180
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:51,702
Minister, I have
something to say to you

181
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:53,661
which you may not
like to hear.

182
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:56,538
Why should today be
any different?

183
00:09:57,944 --> 00:10:03,143
Minister, the traditional allocation
of executive responsabilities

184
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:06,023
has always been so determined
as to liberate

185
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:09,859
the ministerial incumbent
from the administrative minutiae

186
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:13,061
by devolving
the managerial functions

187
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:16,694
to those whose qualifications
have betterformed them

188
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:20,823
forthe performance of such
humble offices, thereby releasing

189
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:24,294
theirpolitical overlords
forthe more onerous duties

190
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:27,581
and deliberations which are
the inevitable concomitant

191
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:29,894
of theirexalted position.

192
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:38,097
What made you think
I wouldn'twant to hearthat?

193
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:40,496
I thought it might upset you.

194
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:43,696
How could it?
I didn't understand a single word.

195
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:47,976
Foronce in your life,
put it into plain English.

196
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,418
If you insist.

197
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:52,616
You are not here
to run this Department.

198
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:54,423
I beg yourpardon?

199
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:57,018
You are not here
to run this Department.

200
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,493
I think I am.
The people think I am, too.

201
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:03,179
With respect Minister,
you are... they are wrong.

202
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:05,335
And who does run
this Department?

203
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,659
I do.

204
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:08,621
Oh, I see...

205
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:11,577
- What am I supposed to do?
- We've been through all this.

206
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:13,223
Make policy.

207
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:15,022
Get legislation enacted.

208
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:18,460
And above all secure
the Department's budget in Cabinet.

209
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,933
It seems the budget
is all you care about.

210
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:22,776
It is rather important.

211
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:26,063
We might end up
with a department so small

212
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:28,419
that even a Ministercould run it.

213
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:33,581
Are we to have a disagreement
about the nature of democracy?

214
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:36,736
No, Minister, merely
a demarcation dispute.

215
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:39,902
What I mean
is that the menial chore

216
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:42,624
of running a department
is beneath you.

217
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:45,299
You're fashioned
fora noblercalling.

218
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:48,456
Well, I leave
the routine paperwork to you

219
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,582
but I must insist on direct access
to all information.

220
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,780
Neveragain
"There are some things

221
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:56,538
it is betterfora Minister
not to know".

222
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:59,537
- Well, Minister...
- That is an order, Humphrey!

223
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:03,657
As you say, Minister.
If that is what you really want.

224
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,499
It's treating Cabinet Ministers
as if they were ten yearolds.

225
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:17,664
Afternoon.

226
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,576
- Finished with The Guardian?
- Yes.

227
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:23,299
I haven't got
the Socialist Workerforyou.

228
00:12:24,184 --> 00:12:26,937
Daddy's pleased to see you down
forbreakfast?

229
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:30,016
- He hasn't seen you fora while...
- I was having a lie-in.

230
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:32,500
Betterthan a sit-in, I suppose.

231
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:35,495
Why were you so late
last night?

232
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:39,100
There are some things it's better
fora fathernot to know.

233
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:40,857
Don't you start!

234
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,453
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

235
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:45,455
I was outwith the Trots.

236
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:47,337
Gosh...

237
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,575
Are you going to see a doctor?

238
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:54,137
The Trotskyites!

239
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:56,660
Oh, a Trotskyite now are you?

240
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:57,973
No. Peter is.

241
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,213
Peter?

242
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:00,698
Yes, Peter.

243
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:03,934
You've only met him
about 15 times.

244
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:06,413
Oh, is he the one with the...
and the...

245
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:07,704
Yes.

246
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:09,940
- Jim, I need yourhelp today.
- Whatwith?

247
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:14,177
Shopping, the kitchen plughole's
blocked, the lawn needs mowing.

248
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:17,734
- I've got all these boxes to do.
- They can wait.

249
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,696
Annie, I am a Cabinet Minister.

250
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:22,014
A member
of Her Majesty's Government.

251
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:23,902
It's a fairly important job.

252
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:27,500
But you have 23.000 civil servants
to help you, I haven't.

253
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:31,779
Play with yourmemos later,
the drains need fixing now.

254
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:33,258
Oh, Lucy!

255
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:36,457
You've got marmalade
all overmy cabinet papers.

256
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:38,104
Oh, God.

257
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:42,264
Now I've got butteron them.
Get a cloth.

258
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:43,982
- Get it yourself.
- Lucy.

259
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,456
You're not in Whitehall now.

260
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:50,902
"Yes, Minister", "Certainly",
"Just as you say".

261
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,055
"May I lick yourboots, Minister?"

262
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:54,339
That's not fair.

263
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:57,735
Those Civil Servants may be
always kowtowing to Daddy,

264
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,293
but they nevertake
any notice ofhim.

265
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:05,903
I've justwon a victory
in my Department.

266
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:07,622
Look at all those boxes.

267
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:10,097
That's what I mean.

268
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:14,263
You were better, now they've
done a snow job on you again.

269
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:17,222
- Not at all, I asked forall this.
- Why?

270
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,054
Humphrey said,
"There are some things

271
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:22,658
it's betterfora Minister
not to know".

272
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:26,334
He's witholding things forme,
probably important things.

273
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:30,133
So I have insisted that I am told
everything that goes on.

274
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:33,903
How did you get to be
a Cabinet Minister?

275
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,543
You're such a clot.

276
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:38,456
- What?
- Don't you see?

277
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:41,661
You've played
right into Humphrey's hands.

278
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:45,738
An open invitation to swamp you
with useless information.

279
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:47,178
I don't think so.

280
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,221
What's in that box,
for instance?

281
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:52,023
Technical reports,
feasibility studies,

282
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,140
past papers
of assorted committees,

283
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,695
stationery requisitions...

284
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,695
Oh, damnation.

285
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:03,614
You can'twin.
It's Catch 22, isn't it?

286
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:06,938
So little information
you don't know the facts,

287
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:08,901
orso much you can't find them.

288
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,260
They've got you
going and coming.

289
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,984
- There's a story about you here.
- I've read it.

290
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:17,056
- "Hacker, The Badger Butcher".
- Daddy's read it.

291
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:19,694
- What's all this then?
- Lot of rubbish.

292
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,377
"Hackeradmitted that removing
protected status

293
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:26,820
from Hayward's Spinney mean
the end of the badgercolony".

294
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:30,894
"A spokesman forthe Preservation
of British Wildlife said:

295
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,983
"Hackerhas signed
the badger's death warrant".

296
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:37,102
One: I am not a babgerb...
badgerbutcher...

297
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,496
Whatever it is.

298
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:42,253
Two: Badgers are not
an endangered species.

299
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:44,774
Three: The removal
of protected status

300
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,378
does not mean
all the badgers will be shot.

301
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:50,138
And four: If a fewbadgers
die forthe sake

302
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:53,979
of a masterplan thatwill save
Britain's natural heritage, tough.

303
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:55,941
A masterplan, mein F?hrer.

304
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:58,493
- The end justifies the means?
- Lucy...

305
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:00,780
It's because badgers can't vote.

306
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:04,300
Lfbadgers had votes, you
wouldn't be exterminating them.

307
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:08,218
You'd be at Hayward's Spinney,
shaking paws, and kissing cubs...

308
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,137
Ingratiating yourself
the way you always do.

309
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:14,581
- Not a nice thing to say.
- It's tue, isn't it?

310
00:16:14,744 --> 00:16:18,373
Yes, but Daddy's in politics.
He has to be ingratiating.

311
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,978
- Thank you very much.
- It's got to be stopped.

312
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:24,420
- The decision has been taken.
- I'm going to stop it.

313
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,941
Quite simple, get yourself
adopted as a candidate,

314
00:16:28,104 --> 00:16:31,255
win a general election,
serve on the back benches,

315
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:34,982
become a Minister
and repeal the act.

316
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:38,383
The badgers might be
getting on a bit by then.

317
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:42,543
Assistant Secretaries
reporting to the Minister!

318
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:43,704
I know.

319
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:46,298
Does he think
he is a civil servant?

320
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:49,214
The arrogance
of these politicians!

321
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:50,618
Ah, Bernard.

322
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:54,264
Thank you.

323
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:56,937
Yes.

324
00:16:58,304 --> 00:16:59,419
Yes.

325
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,219
Yes.

326
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:03,772
Yes.

327
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:06,063
Yes.

328
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:07,699
Fine.

329
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:11,142
You can show that last one
to the Minister.

330
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:13,181
He'll be quiet fora bit.

331
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:17,062
Is something the matter?

332
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:18,856
Well, it's just that...

333
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:21,574
I've been increasingly
worried about

334
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:23,735
keeping things back
from the Minister.

335
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,895
- Shall I...
- No, no, no.

336
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:27,463
What do you mean?

337
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:31,378
Why shouldn't he be allowed
to know things ifhe wants to?

338
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:32,977
Silly Boy!

339
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:38,740
Bernard, this country is governed
by Ministers making decisions

340
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:41,099
from the various
alternative proposals

341
00:17:41,264 --> 00:17:43,653
- thatwe offerthem, is it not?
- Oh, yes.

342
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:44,939
Well...

343
00:17:46,144 --> 00:17:48,374
If they had all the facts,

344
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:51,456
they'd see all sorts
of otherpossibilities.

345
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:53,814
They might even formulate
theirown plans

346
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:56,817
instead of choosing between
the ones thatwe put up.

347
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:58,940
- Would that matter?
- Would it matter!

348
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:00,104
But why?

349
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:03,813
As long as we can formulate
ourown proposals, we can

350
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,853
guide them
to the correct decision.

351
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:08,855
Can we? How?

352
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:12,893
It's like a conjuror.

353
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,097
The Three Card Trick.

354
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:18,654
"Take any card", they pick
the one that you intend.

355
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,612
Ours is the fourword trick.

356
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:26,296
There are fourwords if you want
a Ministerto accept a proposal.

357
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:29,740
Quick. Simple. Popular. Cheap.

358
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:33,013
And there are fourwords
fora proposal

359
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:34,936
if you want it thrown out.

360
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,695
Complicated. Lengthy.
Expensive. Controversial.

361
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:42,940
And to be really sure
the Ministerdoesn't accept it,

362
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:45,254
you say the decision
is courageous.

363
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,096
Worse than "controversial".

364
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,778
"Controversial" means
"this'll lose yourvotes".

365
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:55,016
"Courageous" means
"this will lose you the election".

366
00:18:55,544 --> 00:19:00,493
You see, if they have all the facts
instead of just the options

367
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:03,014
they might start thinking
forthemselves!

368
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,183
- And the system works?
- Works?

369
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:09,099
It's made Britain
what she is today.

370
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:12,098
Oh, yes. I see. Yes.

371
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:15,813
- What about yourman?
- I'm giving him plenty to read.

372
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,576
Shouldn't you showhim

373
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:20,463
the positive virtues
ofbeing kept ignorant?

374
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:24,014
Lfhe doesn't know that
after 20 years as a politician...

375
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:48,223
- You look worried, Bernard.
- I've just found this letter.

376
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:50,261
I don't know
if I should open it.

377
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,823
You know the rules.

378
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:56,057
Private secretaries shall open
all classifications up to Top Secret.

379
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:59,182
Only letters marked "personal"
shall remain unopened,

380
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,653
unless the Minister
orders otherwise.

381
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:03,138
What about Daddy?

382
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:07,698
Where does yourfather
come into this?

383
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:10,022
No. To "Daddy". "Urgent".

384
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:11,663
- Does it say"Personal"?
- No.

385
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:13,735
Well then, it must be opened.

386
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:23,699
- It's from the Minister's daughter.
- You astound me.

387
00:20:27,744 --> 00:20:29,223
Trouble at the mill.

388
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:32,898
Miss Hackerwill join
the badgerprotest.

389
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:35,339
- I thought itwas over.
- She and herboyfriend.

390
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:38,416
A 24 hour"Save the badgers"
vigil in Hayward's Spinney

391
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,336
unless protection is restored.

392
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:43,701
And they announcing it
to the press at 5.00 p. m.

393
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:47,015
"Minister's daughter
in badgerprotest vigil".

394
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:50,703
A little embarrassing,
but not too serious.

395
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:54,413
The Ministerwill be
more than a little embarrassed.

396
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,860
"Minister's daughter in nude
badgerprotest vigil".

397
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,459
What!

398
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,899
Miss Hacker
and herboyfriend will be...

399
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:04,215
that is, will not not be...
I mean...

400
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:07,581
- Do you mean starkers, Bernard?
- Yes, Sir Humphrey.

401
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:11,976
- A different complexion on it.
- Especially in this weather.

402
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:18,902
Put in crude journalistic terms,
this makes it a big story.

403
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:20,941
Front page: with photograph.

404
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:24,418
Hello, Humphrey.

405
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:28,497
Something the matter?

406
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:31,024
Well?

407
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:34,378
Shall we say a slight
embarrassment, Minister?

408
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:35,664
How slight?

409
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:39,939
Withoutwishing in any sense
to overstate the case

410
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:44,414
orcause undue alarm,
nevertheless, the fact remains...

411
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,097
Come on! Outwith it.

412
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:49,663
- I have a confession to make.
- That's a change.

413
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:53,973
Well, come on, Humphrey,
make a clean breast of it.

414
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:57,456
Not the happiest of phrases
underthe circumstances.

415
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,133
How do you mean?

416
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:01,613
I have to confess
that the badgers

417
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:05,140
may be a somewhat biggerstory
than we thought.

418
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:08,899
Don't tell me
they're going to have kittens.

419
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:12,221
It is not the badgers
who are going to have kittens.

420
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:16,172
There'll be a 24 hourprotest vigil
in Hayward's Spinney.

421
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:19,541
- Thatwouldn't be newsworthy.
- This is slightly different.

422
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:21,615
It's to be conducted...

423
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:26,303
by a girl student
and herboyfriend.

424
00:22:27,224 --> 00:22:28,896
- Just the two of them?
- Yes.

425
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:31,419
They don't matter.
A pairof layabouts.

426
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,257
- They might matterto some people.
- Nonsense.

427
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:37,496
These students are
just exhibitionists.

428
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:40,497
In this case they have
something to exhibit.

429
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:43,697
- How do you mean?
- It's to be a nude protest vigil.

430
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:45,013
I see.

431
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:48,097
- Thatwould make the front pages!
- Yes, quite so.

432
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:50,774
The press just mustn't find out.

433
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:54,016
I don't know
what gets into these students.

434
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:57,142
- It's appalling. They're shameless.
- Indeed, Minister.

435
00:22:57,304 --> 00:22:58,896
It's theirparents.

436
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,221
They don't bring them up
properly.

437
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:04,420
Just let them run wild
and feed them

438
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,654
all this antiestablishment
nonsense.

439
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:09,622
Perhaps it isn't entirely
the parents fault.

440
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:11,183
Of course it is!

441
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:13,337
Authority, Humphrey.

442
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:15,222
All this is an indictment

443
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:17,659
of theirparent's lack
of discipline.

444
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:22,422
So they just take it out
on innocent people like me.

445
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:26,656
- Who are they?
- We know the young lady's name.

446
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:28,621
Lady!
Who is she?

447
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,220
It seems she's a Miss Hacker.

448
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,416
Hacker... oh, that's my name.

449
00:23:35,184 --> 00:23:36,697
That's a coincidence.

450
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,495
Not a complete coincidence.

451
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:43,935
Not... not Lucy?

452
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:47,099
Oh, my God!

453
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:49,857
Oh, my God!

454
00:23:50,384 --> 00:23:53,182
She will be telephoning
in ten minutes time.

455
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:58,976
Perhaps the press won't be
all that interested? No, no...

456
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:02,936
Butwill they go all the way
up to Warwickshire?

457
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:04,903
Fora story like this,

458
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:07,862
they'll go all the way
to the South Pole.

459
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:11,016
This story must be killed.
Advise me, Humphrey.

460
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:14,376
What about
a little parental discipline?

461
00:24:14,544 --> 00:24:15,613
Don't be silly.

462
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:19,743
- Make her listen to reason.
- She's a sociology student.

463
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:25,262
Perhaps Mrs. Hacker
could lock her in herroom?

464
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:28,097
Annie's out atwork.
What about the police?

465
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:31,097
"Ministersets police
on nude daughter".

466
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:33,824
I'm not sure that completely
kills the story.

467
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:37,897
- There must be something.
- Perhaps if I look at the files...

468
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:40,817
My daughter's about to get
page one of the Sun,

469
00:24:40,984 --> 00:24:44,260
and probably page three,
and you just think of the files.

470
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,858
- Nevertheless...
- They're all out there.

471
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:50,738
- What angle they'll take?
- Wide angle.

472
00:24:53,104 --> 00:24:55,618
Opposition
will have fun with this.

473
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,219
"Does the proud father
wish to make a statement?".

474
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:00,944
"Is the Hackerfamily getting
too much exposure?".

475
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,414
"Is the Ministertrying
to conduct a coverup?".

476
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:06,462
"Does he run his Department
betterthan his family?".

477
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:09,293
You'd like me to tell them
that Humphrey runs it?

478
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:12,183
No, of course not.
I am your Private Secretary.

479
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,983
Do you mean
that when the chips are down,

480
00:25:15,144 --> 00:25:17,021
you're on my side,
not Humphrey's?

481
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,982
Minister, it's my job to see
the chips stay up.

482
00:25:26,904 --> 00:25:27,904
Hello?

483
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,419
Can I speak to Mr. Hacker?
It's his daughter.

484
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:32,142
It's foryou, Minister.

485
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:34,577
Lucy. Hello, darling.

486
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:36,337
- Hello, Daddy.
- I got yournote.

487
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,495
Fora moment
I thought itwas serious.

488
00:25:38,824 --> 00:25:41,418
It is serious.
It's deadly serious.

489
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:44,382
Pete and I are just going
to ring the press,

490
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,455
then we're off to the Spinney.

491
00:25:46,624 --> 00:25:48,899
Don't do that!
Think of the damage.

492
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,292
What damage?

493
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:51,977
Well... to me.

494
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:53,896
To you? Isn't that typical?

495
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:55,656
What about damage
to badgers?

496
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:57,860
You're not going
to be exterminated.

497
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:00,015
Well, in a sense, yes.

498
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,175
Then you knowwhat to do.

499
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,775
- Ten...
- Look... Look...

500
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:06,093
- Nine...
- Lucy, don't...

501
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,617
- Eight...
- Lucy!

502
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:10,093
If I could have a word
with the young lady.

503
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,824
Sir Humphrey Appleby
wants a word with you.

504
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:16,101
- A new development.
- Six... five...

505
00:26:16,904 --> 00:26:19,976
Miss Hacker...
Ah, how do you do?

506
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:22,016
Humphrey Appleby here.

507
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:25,655
- Mr. Hacker's Permanent Secretary.
- Five and holding.

508
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:27,621
If I could just have a word.

509
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:31,618
I have just seen the latest report
from the Government's inspectors,

510
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:34,503
which throws new light
on the issue.

511
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:35,864
Why?

512
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:39,255
Apparently there is
no badgercolony in Spinney.

513
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:40,823
Now, it says here

514
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:45,292
"Last evidence ofbadger
droppings, freshly turned earth

515
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:47,420
was recorded
eleven years ago".

516
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:48,653
But the papers...

517
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:53,022
Apparently the story was fed
to them by a property developer.

518
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,736
- Property developer?
- Yes. The Council has plans

519
00:26:56,904 --> 00:27:00,214
to use the spinneyfora new College
of Further Education,

520
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:03,820
and the developerwants it
foroffices and luxuryflats.

521
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:07,260
Well, if it's protected
he won't be able to.

522
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:09,415
And, norwill the Council.

523
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:12,816
And he knows they'll use
the moneyforsomething else,

524
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,534
then he can establish
that there's no badgercolony,

525
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:20,174
get the protection orderremoved
and build his offices.

526
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:21,697
It's common practice.

527
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:26,014
So there isn't any wildlife
in the spinney at all?

528
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:29,540
Well, there is some.
It's been used as a rubbish dump

529
00:27:29,704 --> 00:27:34,255
by people from Wootton Wawen,
so there're lots of rats.

530
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:38,141
- Rats?
- Yes. Several thousand, actually.

531
00:27:39,184 --> 00:27:42,654
They are wildlife too,
in theirway, aren't they?

532
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:45,662
Itwould be a pity to play
into the developer's hands.

533
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,861
Yes, I suppose itwould.

534
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:51,414
Yes, I very much respect
yourviews and yourcommitment.

535
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:53,461
Would you like to speak
to the Minister?

536
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:57,299
No, that's all right.
Oh, well. Forget it then.

537
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:03,258
Humphrey!
I take it all back!

538
00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:07,302
Itwas nothing, Minister.
Itwas all in the files.

539
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:08,943
A property developer!

540
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,016
The cunning devils...
Let me look at the file!

541
00:28:12,664 --> 00:28:15,861
I don't think
you'd find them interesting.

542
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:20,095
- Let me have a look.
- No, I don't think you'd...

543
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:21,538
Humphrey!

544
00:28:22,664 --> 00:28:24,495
Itwas true, wasn't it?

545
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:29,460
Was there one word of truth
in that whole story

546
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,057
you told to Lucy?

547
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:34,376
Do you really want me
to answerthat question?

548
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:37,618
No.

549
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:40,860
- I don't think I do.
- Quite so.

550
00:28:41,264 --> 00:28:44,813
Perhaps there are some things
it is betterfora Ministernot to know.
