154
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:45,680
呃 我不知道 1%的可能性吧
Uh, I don't know, maybe like one percent.

155
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:48,299
泰德的手机 马上转接到泰德
Ted's phone. Hold for Ted.

156
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:51,353
你好
Hello.

157
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:53,021
泰德 我要问你一些事情 
Ted, I'm gonna ask you something,

158
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,441
我需要你百分百诚实地回答
and I want you to be completely honest.

159
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:59,111
罗宾的电话是多少
What's your friend Robin's number?

160
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,495
什么
What?

161
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:02,664
泰德 问问船的事情
Ted, ask about the boat.

162
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:09,515
呃 船长 你 你能等一下吗
Uh, Captain, can... can I put you on hold?

163
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,014
没问题
Affirmative.

164
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,586
他想要罗宾的电话号码
He wants Robin's number.

165
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:15,871
我该给他吗
Should I give it to him?

166
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:18,173
他想勾引我的未婚妻
Is he trying to hook up with my fiancee?

167
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:19,541
不 绝对不行
No, uh-uh.

168
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:20,775
这种情况发生只能在
The only way that's happening

169
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,911
我也偷情的情况下
is if I get to hook up with someone, too.

170
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,513
等等...不
Wait a second... No.

171
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,781
除非.. 绝对不行
Unless... Absolutely not.

172
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:28,216
但是... 我在想什么
However... Forget it.

173
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,801
再说了...雅蠛蝶
On the other hand... Ixnay!

174
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:32,938
同志们啊 同志们 我得做个决定
Guys, guys, I got to make a decision here.

175
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,806
这样 我建议 把电话给他
Okay, you know what, I say do it.

176
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,057
如果他打给罗宾约炮
If it is a booty call,

177
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,526
罗宾会委婉地拒绝他
then Robin will just let him down easy,

178
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,594
但同时 泰德又会受到船长的喜爱
but in the meantime, Ted is back on the Captain's good side.

179
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:42,030
我们都能上他的船上玩 我还能掌掌舵
We all get to go out on his boat; I get to steer it.

180
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:43,264
一箭N雕啊
Everybody wins.

181
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,599
有道理
Okay.

182
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,701
好吧 把号码给他吧
Fine. Give him her number.

183
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:48,102
她不会介意吗
You don't think she'll mind?

184
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:49,237
肯定不会
I don't think she'll mind.

185
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,223
你把我的号码给了船长
You gave the Captain my number?

186
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:52,407
嗯 她介意了
She minds.

187
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,542
难道你不记得了吗
Do you not remember

188
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:56,611
那晚我们在艺术展上遇到了他
that night we hung out with him at the art show?

189
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:58,046
哦 是啊 当然你不记得
Oh, right, of course you don't remember

190
00:06:58,048 --> 00:06:59,247
因为 那天早些时候
because, earlier that night,

191
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,249
你和贝琪一起分享了一个超大号的三明治
you shared a big, fat sandwich with Becky.

192
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,249
{\a6}三明治暗指大麻 你懂的

193
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,785
大船 小船 大小船
Boats, boats, boats!

194
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:07,255
这广告什么意思啊
What's this a commercial for again?

195
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,423
是啊 所以呢
Yeah, so?

196
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,559
我不觉得这有多大关系
I hardly think that changes the story.

197
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,394
嗯 嗯
Mmm. Mmm.

198
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:13,595
真好吃
Delicious!

199
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:16,314
这个地方真豪华
This place is so fancy.

200
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:18,233
这种场合你最好别丢人
I hope I don't embarrass myself.

201
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:19,401
哦 别这样啊 莉莉
Oh, come on, Lily.

202
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:21,302
你有什么好让人丢脸的
You got nothing to be embarrassed about.

203
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:25,907
兄弟 看看谁来了
Dude, look who's here.

204
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:27,308
爹地回来了
Daddy's home.

205
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,613
不是你
Nope.

206
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:32,581
看啊
Well, well.

207
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,250
泰德•莫斯比 我的老冤家
Ted Mosby, my old nemesis.

208
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:36,451
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

209
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:39,754
呃 莉莉
Well, Lily...

210
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:42,707
看见 一张 广告 提到这个
saw an ad for this...

211
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,463
画廊
Gallery.

212
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,267
我们想 呃
So we thought we'd, um...

213
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,469
过来看看这些
come and check out the...

214
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,224
艺术品
Artwork?

215
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,981
结果我们撞见了
And then we ran into...

216
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:10,068
我
Me?

217
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,020
船长根本没在看你
And the Captain wasn't glaring at you.

218
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:13,655
他的眼神黏在...
He couldn't take his eyes off...

219
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,189
嘿 再次见到你真好
Hey, nice to see you again.

220
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:16,408
我也是
Yeah, you, too.

221
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,709
哦
Oh.

222
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:19,995
这家伙太粗鲁了
Man, this guy is so rude.

223
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:21,463
我知道他为什么那么生气
I mean, I get why he's upset.

224
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:25,533
我确实和他前妻厮混过 好多次了
I did stick it to his ex-wife... repeatedly.

225
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:27,385
不过呢
Still,

226
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,586
这家伙真是个魂淡
the guy's being a jerk.

227
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:30,922
总得有人灭灭他的威风
Someone needs to take him down a peg.

228
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,724
抱歉
Sorry.

229
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:34,476
失态了
Where are my manners?

230
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:36,811
这是谢莉 我的艺术顾问
This is Shelly, my art consultant.

231
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,480
艺术顾问 干什么的
Art consultant? What's that?

232
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:40,598
谢莉帮船长挑选艺术
Shelly helps the Captain select artwork

233
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,883
通过评审作品...
based on aesthetic...

234
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:43,685
礼貌
Manners!

235
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:46,271
以其人之道 还治其人之身
That's how that feels.

236
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:51,026
以便
...appeal

237
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,411
协助船长投资
and value as an investment,

238
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,229
所以我觉得她会喜欢
and that's why I think she's gonna love

239
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,531
这幅大象画
this elephant painting.

240
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,784
我觉得这个画家前途无量
I think this artist is going places.

241
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,253
我先告辞了
Well, I should go.

242
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,290
船长 我们明天再谈
Captain, we'll talk tomorrow.

243
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:08,093
你们要是喜欢艺术的话
If you like art,

244
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,046
来看看我刚入手的那幅画吧
you should see the painting I just acquired.

245
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:16,718
一定会拿下你的
It's gonna blow you away.

246
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,754
潜水ing
Snorkeling.

247
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,773
然后 在我拯救了差点被你摔破的
Then, after I saved you from destroying

248
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,257
价值连城的水晶烟灰缸后...
a priceless crystal ashtray...

249
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:25,143
不用谢
You're welcome.

250
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:30,315
你好吗 我的亲 我的肝 我生命的四分之三
Hello, my darling, my one true love, my everything.

251
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:32,901
啊嗬 
Ahoy?

252
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:32,901
{\a6}Ahoy是航海时的呼号声

253
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,654
想看看那幅画吗
So who wants to see that painting?

254
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,990
好吧 船长
Okay, Captain.

255
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,960
我们知道你叫我们来
We all know why you brought us up here.

256
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:45,213
是因为我和...呃...
This is about me and, um...

257
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,132
佐伊
Zoey.

258
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:49,334
好吧 泰德
All right, Ted.

259
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,638
你有什么想说的
If you've got something to say,

260
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,638
就说吧
say it.

261
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,006
哇哦 哇哦
Whoa, whoa.

262
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,124
遥控器吗
A remote control?

263
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:57,291
是遥控器
A remote control.

264
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,761
放松点
Let's relax.

265
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:02,230
我 我知道你生气 船长
I-I know you're upset, Captain.

266
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,265
我 我只是 我向你保证
I-I just... I want to assure you

267
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,167
你和佐伊分手以前
nothing happened between me and Zoey

268
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,269
我们什么事都没有
until after you guys had split up.

269
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:10,105
所以请你 请你
So let's just... let's just...

270
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:11,940
把这玩意儿放下
let's put this down.

271
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:15,476
很好 真乖
Okay, okay.

272
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,645
就这样
There we go.

273
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,616
泰德 我没有生你的气
Ted, I'm not mad at you.

274
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:25,820
其实 我爱上别人了
Truth is, I'm in love with somebody else now.

275
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:29,791
就这样 他请我去他卧室
So he invited me back to his bedroom

276
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,876
看那幅画 结果
to show me this painting, and...

277
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,129
终于
Finally.

278
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,630
就剩我俩了
We're alone.

279
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,265
罗宾 别 我不要去想象那个画面
Robin, no, I don't want to picture that.

280
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:38,883
什么都没发生
Nothing happened.

281
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:41,436
哦 那就是说有手工活了
Aw, that means hand stuff. 

282
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:42,604
什么 才没有 
What? No.

283
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:44,355
我是认真的 他还在恢复期
I'm serious-- he was on the rebound.

284
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:48,026
我让他慢慢找回自己
I told him to take some time to pull himself together and...

285
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:49,861
一年半后再打给我
call me in a year and a half.

286
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:51,529
啊 真好
Ah, great.

287
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:52,864
如果他约你出去怎么办
What if he asks you out?

288
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:55,450
我们的感情怎么办
What does that mean for our relationship?

289
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:58,536
难不成你要来段引领潮流的
What, are we planning to be in some super-enlightened,

290
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,288
前卫的婚姻
forward-thinking marriage,

291
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,158
不想被吊死在沉闷又过时的
where we don't get hung up on the suffocating

292
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,577
一夫一妻制上
and outdated principles of monogamy,

293
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,580
享受下万花丛中的乐趣
and instead enjoy the company of multiple partners,

294
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:12,366
偶尔也带其他人滚滚我们的婚床
sometimes bringing said partners into our marital bed,

295
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:14,535
只带女生 男生免进
but just girls, not dudes,

296
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,671
偶尔也可带次男生试试感觉
except maybe one time just to see what that's like?

297
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:19,207
这就是你想要的吗
I mean, is that what you want?

298
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,142
不
No.

299
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:23,178
好吧
Okay.

300
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
我也不想
Me, neither!

301
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:27,599
罗宾 听我说 你得给船长打电话
Okay, Robin, look, you-you need to call the Captain

302
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,068
委婉地拒绝他 好吗
and let him down easy, okay?

303
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,237
让他过自己的生活
Let him move on with his life.

304
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,389
让他和老朋友们 开着小船出去玩 
Let him go out on his boat with his old friends,

305
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:37,742
也许还有些新朋友一起
maybe some new friends.

306
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:41,029
最好让他的某个新朋友也掌掌舵
Maybe let one of those new friends steer the boat.

307
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:44,082
这样的话 那个新朋友就有机会说
Just so that one of them could say,

308
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:47,202
前方有冰山
"Iceberg straighthead!"

309
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:47,202
{\a6}模仿泰坦尼克号情节

310
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:49,204
好吧
Fine.

336
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,293
让我们底线之内能接受的理由的话...

358
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,150
这是谢莉 我的艺术顾问
This is Shelly, my art consultant.

359
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,619
艺术顾问
Art consultant!

360
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,437
那是什么啊
What's that?

361
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,189
谢莉帮船长挑选艺术作品
Shelly helps the Captain select artwork

362
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:52,026
通过审评作品价值 协助船长投资

363
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:52,026

364
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:55,863
所以我觉得她一定会喜欢这幅大象画的
which is why I think she's gonna love this elephant painting.

365
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:55,863

366
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:59,584
我觉得这个画家前途无量
I think this artist is going places.

367
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:02,420
不喜欢这幅画的人肯定是个大傻子
You'd have to be a real Dumbo not to enjoy this painting.

368
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:03,388
懂了吗
Get it?

369
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,922
因为他是个大象画啊
'Cause he's an elephant?

370
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:08,476
你的笑点和你的艺术品位一样低
Your sense of humor is as good as your taste in art.

371
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:10,345
船长先生
Captain?

372
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,712
我们明天再谈吧
We'll talk tomorrow?

373
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:14,649
如果你要是喜欢艺术的话
If you like art,

374
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,684
来看看我刚入手的那幅吧
you should see the painting I just acquired.

375
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:17,735
它在我的...
It's in my...

376
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,404
礼貌
Manners.

377
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:21,222
以其人之道 还治其人之身
That's how that feels.

378
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:27,161
在我楼上的公寓里
In my apartment right upstairs.

379
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,364
一定会征服你们的
It's gonna blow you away.

380
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:31,582
潜水ing
Snorkeling.

381
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:34,168
在我拯救了差点你摔破的
Then, after I saved you from destroying 

382
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,503
价值连城的水晶烟灰缸后
a priceless crystal ashtray...

383
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,954

384
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,576
你好吗 我的亲 我的肝 我生命的四分之三
Hello, my darling, my one true love, my everything.

385
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:48,850

388
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:55,423
于是我们去看画了
So we check out the painting.

389
00:14:55,425 --> 00:15:00,028
哼 那幅大象画挂这里应该很好看
Huh. You know, that elephant painting would look nice in here.

390
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:00,028

391
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,562
眼前的可是大师级的杰作
You're looking at a masterpiece,

392
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:04,032
你却还在提那幅大象画吗

393
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,984
不要啊
No...!

394
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:10,121
哦 这幅也不错
Oh, this one's nice, too.

395
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:13,157
我只是更喜欢那幅大象画
I just like the elephant painting better.

396
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,712
听好 你喜欢什么根本就没人在意
You know, it doesn't matter what you like.

397
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:20,214
你只是个幼儿园老师而已
You're just a kindergarten teacher.

398
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,718

Ah, finally we're alone.

399

哦 不 莉莉 你做了些什么

400
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:37,348
他是个混蛋 他那宝贝画作活该被偷
He was a jerk-- he deserved to have that precious painting stolen.

401
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:37,348

402
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,067
哦 天哪 莉莉 你不会...
Oh, God, Lily, you didn't...?

403
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:40,601
我当然没有
Of course I didn't.

404
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:43,688
我偷了这个烟灰缸
I stole this ashtray instead.

405
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:50,432
-莉莉  -嘿 你知道规矩的
-Lily! -Hey, you know the rules.

406
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,700
表现不好一次 就收走玩具一只
You misbehave, I take away one of your toys.

407
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,418
这是艾尔德林的正义 小宝贝儿

408
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,137
你说咱们家那个烟灰缸
So you're telling me that that ashtray

409
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,173
那个在咱家已经一年半的烟灰缸
that's been in our apartment for over a year and a half

410
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,173

411
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,459
不仅是偷的 还价值连城
is not only stolen, but also very expensive.

412
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,294
全部答对
Both of those things-- yes.

413
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,796
伙计们 让我们俩单独待会儿行吗
Guys, can you leave us alone for a minute, please?

414
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,798
哦 他们要干上了
Ooh, they're gonna do it.

415
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,050
不 我们要干架
No, we're gonna fight.

416
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:13,386
可能干完了架再会儿干那
And then maybe afterwards we'll do it.

417
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:17,357
居然是同一只烟灰缸
I can't believe that was the same ashtray.

418
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,357

419
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,942
我竟然没认出来
I should've recognized it.

420
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,944
是啊 我也没认出来
I know-- me, too.

421
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,762
巴尼 你当时不在
Barney, you weren't there.

422
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,264
你为啥非要成为故事的一部分啊
Why is it so important that you be part of this story?

423
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,034
因为疯疯狂狂就是我
Because crazy stories are my thing.

424
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:29,486
你有你的建筑
You have architecture,

425
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,620
马修有他的法律
Marshall has the law,

426
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,821
莉莉有她的艺术
Lily has art,

427
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,657
罗宾有她的相夫悦我之道
Robin has pleasing me sexually.

428
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,076
你们都有自己的激情
You all have a passion that drives you.

429
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,144
如果我有我的激情
Well, if I have a passion,

430
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:40,330
那就是让怒放的生命变成疯狂的故事
it's taking life and turning it into a series of crazy stories.

431
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,083
如果你没有我也能做到
If you can do that without me, then...

432
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,386
我都不知道我是谁了
I don't even know who I am anymore.

433
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:50,924
知道吗 巴尼
You know what, Barney?

434
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,426
我开始觉得
Now that I think about it,

435
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:54,794
你当时在场
you were there.

436
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:55,729
没错 你在呢
That's right, you were.

437
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,763
我在吗
I was?

438
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,297
我是说 我知道我在的呢
I mean, I know I was.

439
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,850
我就是这个意思 焚蛋们
That's what I'm saying, guys.

440
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:04,604
我们只是没发现你在那儿 因为...
We just, uh... we just didn't realize it because...

441
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,406
你乔装打扮了下
you were in disguise.

442
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,409
没错 你在那上演泡妞宝典里的一出呢
Yeah, you were doing, uh, one of your plays from the playbook.

443
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,409

444
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,578
对 谢莉 那个艺术顾问 
On Shelly, the art consultant.

445
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,280
对 那是个关于艺术之类的招数
Yes, it was, uh, some play that had to do with art...

446
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,983
大芬维克的皇家大公爵吗
The Royal Archduke of Grand Fenwick?

447
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:20,837
一个只需两种居家常备物品 即可完成的简易招式
A simple play you can do using two everyday household objects--

448
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,837

449
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,155
一套普鲁士军装
a Prussian military costume

450
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,673
和一幅自己的油画
and an oil painting of yourself?

451
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,543
就是那个 而且对谢莉还很有效
That's the one, and it worked on Shelly.

452
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:28,828
我完全搞定她了
I totally nailed her!

453
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,464
而且之后我还搞定了她妹妹 那个更加火辣
And then I nailed her sister who was even hotter.

454
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,185
美好时光啊
Good times.

455
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,336
你得去还那个烟灰缸 你最好求老天保佑
You are gonna return that ashtray, and you're gonna pray

456
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:39,839
他不起诉你 要是咱俩之中有人进了监狱
that he doesn't press charges, because I can't be

457
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,507
这场婚姻就没法继续了
in a marriage where one of us is in prison.

458
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,393
我知道我们经常玩夫妻探访的角色扮演
I know that we role-play conjugal visits a lot,

459
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,880
不好意思 这就是终审结果
I'm sorry-- all rulings are final.

460
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:49,448
我不会把这个还他的
I am not taking it back.

461
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,366

好吧 那又怎样
Okay, so what?

465
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,372
就算他说你只是个幼儿园老师
So he said you're just a kindergarten teacher.

466
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:57,907
你为什么非要纠结这句话
Why do you let that bother you?

467
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,209
因为他说得没错
Because he was right.

468
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,327
我就是个小小的幼儿园老师
I am just a kindergarten teacher.

469
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,962
的确 我有一张艺术史的文凭
And, yes, I have a degree

470
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:05,582
而且我确实很想往这方面发展
in art history and I was meant to do something with it,

471
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,833
但我没做到
but I didn't.

472
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,201
不知从什么时候起
Somewhere along the line,

473
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,804
我忘记了追寻自己的梦想 而且
I forgot to pursue my dream, and...

474
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:14,824
而且我现在都老了 还当妈了 一切都来不及了
and now I'm old and I'm a mom and it's just too late for me.

475
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:15,759
莉莉 好了 好了
Lily, okay, okay.

476
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,376
-太晚了  -不不 现在还不晚
-It's too late. -No, no, no, it's not too...

477
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,845
现在还不晚
it's not too late.

478
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,730
你明天就去辞掉你的工作
You're gonna quit your job tomorrow,

479
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,650
然后就 就回到你放弃艺术的地方
and you're gonna... you're gonna go back and pick up

480
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,819
把这个梦想重新拾起来
right where you left off with that art stuff.

481
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,386
然后 你听我说
And then you know what?

482
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:30,607
我会找到谢莉 我会狠狠冲她脸上揍一拳
I'm gonna find Shelly, and I'm gonna punch her in the face.

483
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,826
我会的 我会去揍一个女孩
I am-- I'm gonna punch a girl...

484
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,727
然后赶紧逃
and run away.

485
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,280
听着
Look.

486
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,998
我向你保证
I promise you,

487
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,252
你最美好最激动人心的时刻
your best and your most exciting days

488
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,420
都在未来等着你呢
are all ahead of you.

489
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:49,108
我真的很爱你这样说
I love you so much for saying that,

490
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,928
但生命里总会有那么一天
but there gets to be a point in life

491
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,014
你说的这些都没机会实现
where that just stops being true.

492
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:59,052
很抱歉我偷了东西
I'm sorry I stole this.

493
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,854
我明天第一件事就是去归还
I'll return it first thing tomorrow.

494
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,273
于是第二天 莉莉回到
And so the next day, Lily returned

495
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,058
船长的公寓
to the Captain's apartment.

496
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,559
呃 这个怎么说
Well, how about that.

497
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,394
我根本没意识到这玩意丢了
I didn't even realize it was gone.

498
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:10,947
没啥损失
No harm done.

499
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,733
等等 如果你不是为了这个烟灰缸打电话给我
Wait, if you weren't calling about the ashtray,

500
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,485
那你为什么想见我
then why'd you want to see me?

501
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,870
跟我来
Follow me.

502
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:22,208
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

503
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,878
是的 那天晚上我又回到画廊
Yep, that night, I ducked back down

504
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,579
把这幅画买了下来
into the gallery and bought it.

505
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,281
谢莉没有阻止你吗
Shelly didn't stop you?

506
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:31,084
谢莉跟她在派对上遇见的什么皇家大公爵走了
Shelly was off with some archduke she met at the party.

507
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,469
不 我只是... 怎么说呢
No, I just... well,

508
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:36,005
我喜欢你说的那句 你就是很喜欢这幅画
I liked what you said about how you just liked it.

509
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,757
我现在还是喜欢
I still do.

510
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,893
我也喜欢
Me, too.

511
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,792
不管怎样 我刚把它卖了四百万
Anyway, I just sold it for $4 million.

512
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:42,680
我勒了去
What?

513
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,098
在我买下这幅画之后不到一年半
In the year and a half since I bought this piece,

514
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,067
那个画家就成为了艺术界的大明星
the artist has turned into a huge star in the art world.

515
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,103
大家都称赞道 他就是下一个巴斯奎特 
The next Basquiat, they're saying.517

516
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,103
{\a6}让•米切尔•巴斯奎特 美国著名涂鸦艺术家

517
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,988
但除了你之外 没有人如此远见卓识
And nobody saw it coming except you.

518
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,608
所以我决定给你一半的卖画收入
So I've decided to give you half my earnings from the sale.

519
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,476
开玩笑的
I'm just kidding.

520
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:59,495
我不会给你两百万
I'm not giving you two million bucks.

521
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:01,647
虽然 我可以给你
I mean, I could.

522
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,816
很随意 这对我来说小事一桩
Easily-- it wouldn't even make a dent for me.

523
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:06,703
但相信我 按现在这样的税率
But trust me, the tax code being what it is,

524
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,955
你肯定不想当有钱人
you do not want to be rich right now.

525
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,707
所以我在想
So here's what I'm thinking.

526
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,675
我想重回艺术收藏界
I want to get back in the art game,

527
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,595
而我需要一个新的艺术顾问
and I need a new art consultant.

528
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:19,632
等等 你是在给我提供工作吗
Wait, are you offering me a job?

529
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,134
如果你想干的话
If you want it.

530
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,886
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

531
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,772
然后莉莉答应了 同志们 多么激动人心啊 
And she said yes. Guys, it was amazing!

532
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:27,006
-你们也在场就好了  -巴尼
-You should have been there. -Barney!

533
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,441
-你这次不在场  -让莉莉自己讲完
-You were not there. -Let her tell her story.

534
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:29,576
别吵了
Guys! 

535
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:32,445
你怎么说的 亲爱的
What did you say, baby?

536
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:34,113
我答应了
I said yes.

537
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:35,514
哈 我早说吧
Ha! Told you!

538
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,285
我是怎么知道她答应了的
How would I know that she was going to say...?

539
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:43,481
大芬维克的皇家大公爵

540
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
