1
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,341
Care for a cupcake?

2
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:06,477
Well, our new outdoor seating area

3
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:10,114
is about as popular as
Paula Deen at an NBA game.

4
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:14,485
How much longer do we have to be out here?

5
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:16,020
We are cold.

6
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:18,722
So, so cold.

7
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:20,524
I can see my breath.

8
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:23,127
And my boys are up by my rib cage.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,565
I can smell his breath.

10
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:31,202
And my boys are up by
where my boys used to be.

11
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:36,006
And these customers aren't helping.

12
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:38,242
How could we have thought
a strong Han presence

13
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:40,211
would make it more popular?

14
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:41,812
Max, in hindsight,

15
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:44,615
it feels like us not
springing for those heat lamps

16
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:45,916
was a bad call.

17
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:48,118
Uh, you think?

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,189
Guys, I just peed a little to keep warm.

19
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:58,062
Well, I peed a little

20
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,197
'cause I had no choice.

21
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,535
Great, they're stuck to the bench.

22
00:01:06,906 --> 00:01:09,340
Go get the windshield scraper.

26
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,783
Reading Us Weekly, Earl?

27
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:31,119
Ooh, "Stars. They're just like us."

28
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:33,054
Well, if they're just like
us, where's the picture

29
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:35,256
of them turning their underwear inside out?

30
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:41,696
Caroline left it in the men's room.

31
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:44,065
And as I said that out loud,

32
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:47,302
I realized that I must have
been in the ladies' room.

33
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,838
I can't see, Max.

34
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,609
Max, I've got some exciting news!

35
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:57,478
Eh, I vowed I'd never get
excited about anything again

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,014
after that last Indiana Jones.

37
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:03,318
I found us two discount
heat lamps on Sherry's list.

38
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,620
It's like Craigslist, but
without the high probability

39
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:08,690
of being murdered by a
deranged medical student.

40
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:10,491
And about those lamps?

41
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:12,026
Uh, no.

42
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,661
We can't worry about our outdoor business.

43
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,763
We barely have an indoor business.

44
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:18,132
And we never will, with that attitude.

45
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:20,101
I'm gonna ask you one more time:

46
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:22,337
please listen to those Tony Robbins tapes

47
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:25,139
we found in the garbage.

48
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,708
Well, girls,

49
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,643
tomorrow's the day I've
been looking forward to

50
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:29,744
for three years.

51
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:33,181
You're getting your teeth cleaned?

52
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:35,750
Sorry, that's what's we've
been looking forward to.

53
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:37,652
I'm moving in with Sophie.

54
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:42,724
From now on, the booty call is
coming from inside the house.

55
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:45,360
I couldn't help but overhear.

56
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:46,794
From way back there?

57
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:50,865
Your ears should give a pep talk
to the other parts of your body.

58
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:53,835
And, Oleg, if you need
any help with the move,

59
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:55,837
might I offer my services?

60
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:59,273
My trainer Skylar says I'm getting ripped.

61
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:02,343
Yeah, ripped off by Skylar.

62
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:03,611
Thanks, Han.

63
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:05,213
And as a bit of a payback,

64
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:08,316
I'll wash my hands back here tonight.

65
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,586
See you later, neighbors.

66
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:12,854
Oleg's moving in?

67
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,889
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

68
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:17,125
And I lost $2 billion.

69
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:20,294
What is the problem? This is all good news.

70
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:22,363
Sophie an Oleg are in love.

71
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:23,431
Yeah!

72
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,866
And they'll be in love

73
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:26,868
on our stairs,

74
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,770
in our hallway,

75
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:31,773
and on every surface of the laundry room.

76
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:35,276
What do you know about love
anyway, Christian Single?

77
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:39,080
I know Jesus has a girl for me.

78
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,214
He has to.

79
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:43,317
I'm $400 deep into that damn website.

80
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:47,021
Look, we just make a pact

81
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,823
that no matter what happens upstairs,

82
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,159
or on the stairs or in the laundry room,

83
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,061
we don't invite it into our apartment.

84
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:55,029
Hey, everybody!

85
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:00,968
Oh! Brr!

86
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,338
It's raining cats and goats out there.

87
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,941
Don't you mean "cats and dogs"?

88
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:10,511
Oh, it's so nice to be corrected
as you walk in the door.

89
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:12,847
Hey, baby.

90
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,484
Can you believe in 24 hours
we'll be living in sin?

91
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:17,652
Oh, don't worry.

92
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,388
My parents don't know.

93
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,624
I'm having a dinner party
tomorrow night to celebrate.

94
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:26,694
And also because I have 15 pounds of beef

95
00:04:26,696 --> 00:04:29,163
that's about to go bad.

96
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:31,065
So, Max, Caroline, are you in?

97
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,366
Actually, Sophie, we're busy...

98
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,435
We'll be there.

99
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,637
If there's beef involved, I'm involved.

100
00:04:38,374 --> 00:04:40,475
What happened to the pact we just made?

101
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:41,776
I hate to tell you this...

102
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:44,212
if it comes down to you or beef,

103
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:46,047
I'm always going beef.

104
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,292
That was Sherry from Sherry's list.

105
00:04:58,294 --> 00:04:59,961
She makes you call her that.

106
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:01,896
She said she's consider charging us $150

107
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:03,931
if we pick up the heat lamps themselves.

108
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:06,267
And I'm charging you with
three counts of interrupting

109
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,202
this "Baby in a Faulty High Chair" video.

110
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,907
Someone fell in real life!

111
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,145
You told me you had it.

112
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,213
I said I didn't have it.

113
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,549
It's Oleg and Han moving in.

114
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,017
Get away from the door!

115
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,619
Han will see your feet under the door.

116
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:26,787
They're right at his eye level.

117
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:30,992
This is like a horror movie... Saw III.

118
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,527
Because when Han bent over,

119
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:35,163
I saw 3 inches of his crack.

120
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:38,099
So you saw his whole crack?

121
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:40,735
Step away!

122
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,336
Open the door, Max.

123
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:43,571
I'm about to kill Han,

124
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:45,273
and I know you're gonna want to see that.

125
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,375
Damn it! He's right.

126
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:53,881
Cute outfit, Han.

127
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:55,683
Like one of those male strippers

128
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:57,919
from "No Thunder From Down Under."

129
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:01,255
This is so heavy.

130
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:03,191
Oleg, what do you have in here?

131
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,159
Socks!

132
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:07,795
Really, Han,

133
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:10,765
It's like your arms are
only there for decoration.

134
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,035
To be fair, Oleg's socks

135
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:17,305
probably have some pretty
heavy loads in them.

136
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:20,975
Oleg, what is all your junk doing out here?

137
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:23,678
Do I actually smell girls screaming?

138
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,181
I bring things up, Sophie says "No,"

139
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:29,016
I bring them right back down.

140
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:31,219
Is there no elevator up in this bitch?

141
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,122
Oleg, you forgot your painting,

142
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:37,525
and this one's a definite "No."

143
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,894
Sophie, I haven't gotten a "Yes" yet,

144
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:43,664
aside from the quickie we had
up against the bathroom sink.

145
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,099
Not such a quickie.

146
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:48,736
They locked me out and I had
to eat my lunch in the truck.

147
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:52,106
Then what was the point of
me renting a moving truck?

148
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:55,977
I mean, besides the rough sex
we had up against the sides?

149
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,180
They locked me outside on the
side of the road for that one.

150
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:02,883
Okay, well, we have to go back in.

151
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:05,286
See you tonight
at the beef-a-thon.

152
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:07,488
No, Oleg.

153
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,590
Maybe I'm being unfair.

154
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:12,593
I mean, you have all
this stuff that you like,

155
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,862
and they have an apartment.

156
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:16,831
Put it in there.

157
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,666
Sophie!

158
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:20,534
I'll see you at 8:00!

159
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:22,637
So what do you say, girls?

160
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,971
Absolutely not...

161
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,239
Yes.

162
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:28,075
Max, there's a method to my madness.

163
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:30,311
Oleg, will you excuse us a second?

164
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:31,979
And maybe help Han with that box.

165
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:35,182
In those shorts, I can
actually see a hernia happening.

166
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:40,688
I thought we weren't getting involved!

167
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,089
If we help Oleg out,

168
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:43,324
he'll let us use the moving truck

169
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:44,292
to pick up our heat lamps.

170
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:45,893
I already said "No" to those.

171
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:47,628
But we just talked about it!

172
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,964
I wasn't listening!

173
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:54,035
That baby fell face-down
into mashed potatoes.

174
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:57,038
But you said "Yes" to the dinner party,

175
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,675
so if you get your meat, I get my heat.

176
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:04,512
Just because you rhyme
doesn't make it okay.

177
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:07,315
And I'm pretty sure that's what
Rihanna said to Chris Brown.

178
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,626
Where are we meeting this
chick with the heat lamps?

179
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:21,594
I haven't gone this far
for something I didn't want

180
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,864
since Planned Parenthood
moved to New Jersey.

181
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:25,999
Hello!

182
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,500
I'm getting truck sick back here.

183
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:31,137
You're a worse driver
than people assume I am.

184
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,106
Come on! Come on!

185
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:34,874
We're gonna be late to dinner!

186
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:37,110
Would any of you be interested in playing

187
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:39,245
rock-paper-scissors
for a seat up front?

188
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:40,580
No!

189
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:44,017
Girls, can I ask you a
relationship question?

190
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:45,351
No!

191
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:48,088
And besides, what would we
know about relationships?

192
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,355
That's like asking Donald Trump

193
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:52,092
for the name of a good hairstylist.

194
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:53,860
I mean, what's the deal with her?

195
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,361
She asks me to move in,

196
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:57,497
and then won't even
let me have my painting?

197
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,732
I mean, Sophie already bought the cow.

198
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,435
She might as well let the cow's crap in.

199
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:05,004
So you're saying I'm right.

200
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:06,806
No, no, but I do think...

201
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:08,108
No, you don't think,

202
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,076
or your mouth wouldn't be moving right now.

203
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:12,378
I'm just saying,

204
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,414
he has the right to move some of his stuff

205
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,250
into Sophie's apartment and out of ours.

206
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,985
Speaking of his stuff,

207
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:20,720
there's something in a box back here

208
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:23,223
is humming, and... oh, it stopped.

209
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:26,392
Oh, it started again.

210
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:29,863
That's my lifelike mouth
with authentic jaw action.

211
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:31,531
Oleg, watch the road!

212
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:34,667
The last words I hear
can't be "lifelike mouth."

213
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:41,875
Everything looks very nice, Sophie.

214
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:43,576
Yeah, see,

215
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:46,746
I'm not gonna talk until
the other guests arrive.

216
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:52,018
I got to save my hostess
sparkle for the real guests.

217
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:54,854
Hey, baby.

218
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:57,624
Where the hell have you been?

219
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:00,460
That was a pretty loud sparkle.

220
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:02,629
It's my fault we're late, Sophie...

221
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:04,364
It's okay. Just sit down.

222
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,132
Don't you want to know what I was...

223
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:07,133
No, really.

224
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:08,401
I got a pot roast over here

225
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:10,603
that's a hell of a lot more interesting.

226
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:13,673
Max, thank God you're here.

227
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:15,441
There was so much awkward silence,

228
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:18,678
I pretended I got a
phone call from a banana.

229
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:22,081
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

230
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,951
Oh, Oleg, Dinner is ready.

231
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:28,321
You don't have time to
run down to the "Y" now.

232
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:32,392
No, I meant I would shower here.

233
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:34,594
Here...

234
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:39,165
In my bathroom?

235
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,600
Uh...

236
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:41,834
Yeah.

237
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:43,903
I live here now.

238
00:10:43,905 --> 00:10:46,172
Oh, yeah.

239
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:48,408
That's right.

240
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,276
Imagine that.

241
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:53,913
Hey, Oleg, why don't
you just come over here

242
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:55,515
and sit next to Earl?

243
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:59,085
Because he's old and I'm
sure his smeller is shot.

244
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:04,991
Sophie, you really must write
a "how to entertain" book.

245
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,727
Here we go:

246
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:11,197
Grandma Chinkski's pot roast.

247
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,498
This looks amazing.

248
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,534
I love a root vegetable in the winter.

249
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:18,805
Can it ever just be about me?

250
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:24,377
♪ Beef, beef, beef ♪

251
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,013
♪ B-beef,
b-beef, beef ♪

252
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:29,182
What? That's my beef song.

253
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:34,487
I'd like to make a toast to Sophie.

254
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,489
Oh, that's sweet.

255
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:38,491
But not with that glass.

256
00:11:38,493 --> 00:11:40,727
That's Grandma Chinski's crystal.

257
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:43,896
Baby, I was in the middle of a toast.

258
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:45,832
Oh, I'm sorry, but...

259
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,134
those are my favorite thing!

260
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:52,472
Grandma Chinski traded two
of my slow cousins for those.

261
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,844
Well, you know, it's funny.

262
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:59,712
I have a favorite thing too.

263
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:02,215
In fact, why don't I just go and get it?

264
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:04,117
I can't believe it.

265
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:06,352
I'm about to meet Lon Anderson!

266
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:10,089
Can someone help me lift up my fork?

267
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:13,226
My arms are still sore from the move.

268
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:14,594
Open up.

269
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:18,364
Someone else has to feed Han.

270
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:21,301
He just licked my pinky.

271
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:24,671
Earl, what are you doing over there?

272
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:29,676
Just hanging out with R&B sensation,

273
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:33,012
Mary J.-juana.

274
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:34,547
Oh, good.

275
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:37,583
So you're in the right mind-set
to hand-feed a 30-year-old man.

276
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,321
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

277
00:12:41,323 --> 00:12:44,257
I think that's Polish for "No."

278
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,459
Uh-huh. Yes, Sophie.

279
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:49,562
It's my painting. Excuse
me... our painting.

280
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:52,865
And it's going up on our wall.

281
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,834
Is it me,

282
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:57,770
or is this party tense as hell?

283
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:02,775
I don't think Sophie and
Oleg are gonna make it.

284
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:07,180
Uh-oh. Am I talking out loud right now?

285
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:13,186
I told you, I don't
want that thing in here.

286
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:15,154
I don't understand. It's just a painting.

287
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:16,622
What's so bad about it?

288
00:13:18,326 --> 00:13:20,493
Oh, my God.

289
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:24,197
Nice, huh?

290
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,431
I did it myself.

291
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,333
It's a
paint-by-numbers.

292
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:30,002
You mean it's a
Putin-by-numbers.

293
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,972
Why are his nipples so big?

294
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:35,208
They don't seem that big to me.

295
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:41,814
Oh, I am too high for this.

296
00:13:41,816 --> 00:13:43,950
I'm not high enough.

297
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:49,422
In my culture, big nipples
mean power and wealth.

298
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:51,457
In our culture, big nipples means,

299
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:54,327
"Wears a t-shirt in the pool."

300
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,095
There.

301
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:57,497
I like it.

302
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,035
Adds a certain something to the room.

303
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:05,972
Every wall needs nipples.

304
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:08,241
So a guy knows where to look.

305
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:12,812
Thank you for telling
me to do this, Caroline.

306
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,749
She did?

307
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:22,121
I'd get up and run, but
my legs are like taffy.

308
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,690
Seriously,

309
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:27,193
you told him to hang that thing up?

310
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:30,196
In fairness, I had not seen the painting

311
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:31,998
when I suggested something like that.

312
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,066
I mean, I get it.

313
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:36,335
It's gorgeous.

314
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:39,539
But it doesn't go with the décor.

315
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,140
What?

316
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:45,912
Is it throwing off this
gorgeous outdoor-indoor swing?

317
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:49,282
I'll cut you with the carving knife!

318
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Nobody is cutting anyone.

319
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:55,855
Especially not me.

320
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:58,124
Do you never learn?

321
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:00,359
Just put some beef in
your napkin like I did,

322
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:02,862
and let's get out of here.

323
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,096
Sophie, you asked me to move in.

324
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:07,900
Guess what? I moved in.

325
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,369
Yes, I asked you to move in,

326
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:13,606
but not with big weird-nipple Putin.

327
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:16,976
Well, how big are nipples supposed to be?

328
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:18,878
'Cause... never mind.

329
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:22,048
And what's your problem anyway?

330
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,584
I gave you a drawer.

331
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:26,252
This!

332
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:28,421
This is my drawer.

333
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:31,324
What good is this?

334
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:34,627
I can't even get one of
my ball gags in there.

335
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:39,765
You asked for a drawer,
I gave you a drawer!

336
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:43,069
And who needs 12 ball gags anyway?

337
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:46,506
Oh, so now you don't like ball gags?

338
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:48,674
Who are you, lady?

339
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:52,645
I'll tell you who I am...

340
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:57,783
I'm the lady who's
"Putin" this is the trash!

341
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:03,623
You trash that, I'll trash this.

342
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,757
Oh, no.

343
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,192
Oh, you think you're gonna break

344
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:07,860
one of Grandma Chinski's glasses?

345
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:11,130
No, if anyone's gonna
break one, it's gonna be me!

346
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:16,102
This reminds me of the first
half of my second marriage,

347
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:18,437
and the second half of my third marriage.

348
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,575
Sophie, I'm done.

349
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:24,610
And as you said to me on our first date,

350
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:27,346
"I don't know how much
more of this I can take."

351
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:33,619
Fun party.

352
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:35,288
Not awkward at all.

353
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,722
I should get going though.

354
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:38,891
Got to be up early for... what's a thing?

355
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,293
Church?

356
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,831
♪ Beef, beef, beef ♪

357
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,035
♪ B-beef, beef, beef, beef ♪

358
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,886
Sorry about that dinner party last night.

359
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:06,690
It kind of got away from me a little bit.

360
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,860
But I really appreciate
you getting up early

361
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,696
and helping me move Oleg's stuff back.

362
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,965
I just actually feel like this
is a little bit my fault...

363
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,566
Seriously!

364
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,003
Can it ever just be about me?

365
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,905
Hey, um,

366
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,074
where are we taking his stuff anyway?

367
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,343
I don't think Goodwill
will take a love seat

368
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:30,213
that's actually covered in love.

369
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,182
Well, I was thinking,

370
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,451
you know, since Oleg and I

371
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,087
really did have something special,

372
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,089
I was thinking I would just take his stuff

373
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,558
and dump it down by the river.

374
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Okay, I'm just gonna say it...

375
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,262
Sophie, would it kill you

376
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,931
to just let Oleg hang the damn painting?

377
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,706
So what, you just park the truck

378
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,808
in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway?

379
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,677
Do you never learn?

380
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,680
I almost ate
Rent-A-Truck floor mat.

381
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:07,617
Caroline, you get this straight...

382
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,553
Oleg was wrong.

383
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,223
And those nipples were way too big.

384
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:16,960
This is awkward.

385
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,563
You're in the truck?

386
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,566
No, you're in my apartment.

387
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,205
I think something hit us.

388
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,145
You guys just need some couples therapy.

389
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,112
I'll mediate it,

390
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:37,414
since I've had therapy myself.

391
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,051
Not as a couple, but hopefully someday.

392
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,254
I'm just sitting here waiting
for the tow truck to come.

393
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,456
How's your neck, Max?

394
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,757
Not so bad.

395
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,226
The second car that hit us kind of knocked

396
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:53,930
what the first car knocked
out of place back in place.

397
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,998
I'll start.

398
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,367
This woman is a fraud and a liar.

399
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,035
Okay, well,

400
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,771
we need a little more Oprah,
a little less Jerry Springer.

401
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,740
Hey, don't dis Springer.

402
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,042
They have great snacks in the green room.

403
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,877
You were on Jerry Springer?

404
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:10,046
Yeah, I was on "I hate my roommate

405
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,882
and I don't know how to tell her."

406
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,185
Oleg and I are not gonna
talk this thing out.

407
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,187
If you want to waste your time,

408
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,055
go teach in an inner city high school.

409
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,025
You know what? Even better...

410
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,860
I'll do the talking for Oleg.

411
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,996
Oh, then, Max... you be me, okay, Max?

412
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,263
Oh... I don't know if...

413
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:29,265
Do you want the rest of the beef, or not?

414
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:32,369
This guy is a bum, and
the painting has to go.

415
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,937
It's stupid.

416
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,405
Really, really good, Max,

417
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,440
but next time just arch your
back a little, and, yeah.

418
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,309
Yeah.

419
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,177
Okay, you be me.

420
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,915
No, I don't feel like getting a
threatening erection right now.

421
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,885
But I will say, anytime
people move in together,

422
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,353
it's a compromise.

423
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,755
Look at Max...

424
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,457
when I needed a place to
stay, she let me have my horse.

425
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,827
Let me just say... and I
brought this up on Springer...

426
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,831
I only let you in because of the horse.

427
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,134
And I finally stopped putting up a fight

428
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,036
and let Max walk around naked.

429
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,170
When did that happen?

430
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,439
Tomorrow.

431
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,840
Oh, Oleg,

432
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,843
I wouldn't want you to give
up walking around naked.

433
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,213
I mean, as long as you don't
sit down on anything white.

434
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,815
Makes sense.

435
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:22,419
Nobody likes a chocolate
starfish on an ottoman.

436
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,624
Point, Sophie.

437
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,994
Ha! I'm winning, everybody!

438
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,529
Well, it's therapy.

439
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,431
There are no winners and losers.

440
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,001
Sounds like something a loser would say.

441
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,570
You know, Oleg,

442
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,140
this isn't about that
silly little painting.

443
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,976
It's just, uh,

444
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:51,214
a lot of change in a
short amount of time...

445
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,020
I'm so scared.

446
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,123
Sophie,

447
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,693
I don't care about my
stuff, as long as I have you.

448
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:09,299
What did we just do?

449
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,935
We had them apart, and now we
just put them back together.

450
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,139
You did that.

451
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,422
You don't know when to butt out.

452
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:16,306
Jerry's words.

453
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:29,944
