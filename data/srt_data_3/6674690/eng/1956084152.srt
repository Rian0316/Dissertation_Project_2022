1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:02,666
Hey, whatcha doing?

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:04,685
Improving our wedding photos.

3
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:06,086
Oh, that's nice.

4
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:08,264
Wait, I'm still in them,
right?

5
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:10,778
Of course.
And not only you.

6
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:13,420
I've added some guests
who couldn't be there.

7
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:16,233
Who's that next
to my father?

8
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:18,001
The Wright brothers.

9
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:20,486
And why are they
at our wedding?

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,301
Orville,
because I admire him;

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:24,705
Wilbur, because he was
Orville's plus-one.

12
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:27,307
Oh.

13
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,470
You got an e-mail
from someone named Tam.

14
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:31,705
Tam?
What does he want?

15
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,362
Uh...

16
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:34,875
looks like he's coming

17
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,560
to give his son
a tour of Caltech.

18
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,220
He's hoping you guys
can meet up.

19
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,228
He would like that, wouldn't he?

20
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:42,752
Well, that is the gist
of the e-mail.

21
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:44,556
Who's Tam?

22
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:45,825
He was my best friend

23
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:47,496
in the whole world
growing up.

24
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:48,695
Really?

25
00:00:48,805 --> 00:00:50,906
Why have I never heard
you mention him before?

26
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,119
Oh, of course I have.
I'm sure I've mentioned him,

27
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:54,378
like, five times this week.

28
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:55,770
I don't think you have.

29
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,228
Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam!
There, it's only Thursday.

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,349
I didn't just drink
the crazy milk,

31
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:06,131
I bought the crazy cow.

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,319
So, are you actually engaged
to this woman you just met?

43
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:37,770
- Yeah.
- Tell us the truth.

44
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,485
Did she get you
pregnant?

45
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:41,374
Very funny.

46
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,317
Guys, I need your help, okay?
I'm trying

47
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,993
to buy her
engagement ring.

48
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:46,093
What do you
think of this?

49
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,278
Do you think she'll
like this one?

50
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:49,691
Well, it's hard to say,
not knowing much about her.

51
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:51,402
Does she have fingers?

52
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:53,778
Yes, she has ten fingers

53
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:55,540
and ten toes.
Probably.

54
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,063
I'll get back to you
after I see her in sandals.

55
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:00,981
Hey, did you guys know
that Sheldon had

56
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:03,239
a best friend growing up
named Tam?

57
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:05,767
Was that the imaginary
talking koala?

58
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,074
No. He's a real person
who apparently betrayed him.

59
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:12,032
Yeah, so did the koala.

60
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,292
I tried to ask him
about it,

61
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,497
and he invoked section three,
article five

62
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:19,696
of the marriage contract:
beeswax comma none of your.

63
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,300
I can't pry.
I mean,

64
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,528
I have to respect
his wishes.

65
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:26,616
Wow. I wonder
what that guy could've done

66
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,871
to make Sheldon
not talk to him for 20 years.

67
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,243
I wonder if it'd work
a second time.

68
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:38,173
I'm pumping!

69
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:39,907
It's Penny.

70
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,493
Oh. Come in.

71
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:43,606
I thought you were pumping.

72
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,595
I thought you were my boss.

73
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:49,124
Okay, listen, I'm really worried
about this whole Raj thing.

74
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,462
I know, he's so desperate
to get married, which is weird,

75
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,286
because I can't imagine
we make it look that great.

76
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:54,984
I know, right?
You know,

77
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:56,192
if this woman's
gonna be around, I think

78
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,327
we should check her out
a little.

79
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,217
I looked online.
She doesn't have an Instagram,

80
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:02,040
which means she's either 80
or something's wrong with her.

81
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:04,788
Well, I could ask my dad.

82
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,648
Maybe he can get some
of his old cop buddies

83
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:07,989
to do a background
check on her.

84
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,767
- Would he do that?
- Of course.

85
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:12,384
He's a retired cop
who plays by his own rules.

86
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,004
Hi, Daddy.

87
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,135
No, everything's good.

88
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,325
I just have a favor to ask.

89
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:18,796
Yeah, so, my friend Raj

90
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:20,866
is marrying this woman
that he barely knows,

91
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:22,887
and I wanted to see if you
could use your connections

92
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:24,337
to dig up any dirt on her.

93
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:25,632
Uh-huh.

94
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:26,860
Sure.

95
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,063
Okay. Love you.

96
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,343
Is he in?

97
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,884
Absolutely not. He won't do it.
It's totally illegal.

98
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,196
I thought you said
he played by his own rules.

99
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,031
He does, but apparently,
they're very similar

100
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,915
to the actual rules.

101
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,061
I still can't believe
Sheldon had a best friend

102
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:45,356
we've never
heard about.

103
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,243
Ooh, somebody's <i>jealous.</i>

104
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,648
- I'm not jealous.
- Leonard,

105
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:53,507
this is a safe space...
It's okay to be vulnerable.

106
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,929
All I'm saying is

107
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:58,012
you know the timing
of a fellow's bowel movements,

108
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,687
you don't think there's
a lot left to discover.

109
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:03,655
I wonder what Tam
could have done.

110
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,783
Hmm. Well, if Sheldon doesn't
want to talk about it,

111
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,318
it's got to be
pretty upsetting.

112
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:10,009
I have his brother George's
number... he might know.

113
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:11,655
Really?
You have George's number?

114
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,415
So so <i>jealous.</i>

115
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,778
Yeah, sure, I remember Tam,

116
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:21,204
Sheldon's little Vietnam buddy.

117
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:23,676
The two of them were
always running around together.

118
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:24,879
So, what happened?

119
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:26,006
What do you mean?

120
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:27,981
Well, I mean, Sheldon
never talks about him.

121
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,493
They haven't spoken in years.
He wasn't at the wedding.

122
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:32,069
He wasn't?

123
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,702
All right, well,
this is embarrassing,

124
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,973
'cause I had a long conversation

125
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,017
with someone
who I thought was Tam.

126
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:41,600
Wait, wait, so you don't know
what their fight was about?

127
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:43,382
I wish I could help you, boys.

128
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,028
But, you know,
Sheldon used to keep

129
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,715
an enemies list
when he was a kid.

130
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:48,038
Oh, he still does.

131
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,012
Really? I figured
that went the same way

132
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,379
as his bathroom schedule.

133
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,329
If you mean digitized, annotated
and put online, it did.

134
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,246
Maybe that'll tell you
something.

135
00:04:57,324 --> 00:05:00,679
Hey, while you're looking at it,
if I'm still on there

136
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:02,570
for peeing
in his shampoo bottle...

137
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,188
Eh, you know what,
just leave it.

138
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,445
- See ya, boys.
- Bye.

139
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,601
- Bye.
- All right, got his enemies list.

140
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,062
Ooh, he updated
the interface.

141
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,301
You can search
by first name,

142
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,853
last name or length of grudge.

143
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:16,313
I-Is Tam on it?

144
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:17,663
Let's see.

145
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,387
Yep. Right here.
Tam Nguyen.

146
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:21,168
- Oh, great. What did he do?
- Hold on.

147
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:23,680
I have to agree
to the terms of service.

148
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,275
No, I'm not a robot.

149
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,263
Okay.

150
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:31,493
"Which of these are plants?"

151
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,540
And we're in.

152
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,023
- Great. What-what does it say?
- Well...

153
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:37,509
"He knows what he did."

154
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,500
Oh, come on.

155
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:42,273
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, if Tam knows

156
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:43,765
what he did,
we can just ask him.

157
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,228
He's gonna be on campus tomorrow
showing his son around.

158
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:47,594
Won't that make Sheldon mad?

159
00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:49,411
Everything makes
Sheldon mad.

160
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:51,145
- Yeah.
- Look at his list.

161
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:52,890
Jim Henson for, quote,

162
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:56,434
"putting a terrifying,
giant yellow bird on television

163
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:58,845
and in my nightmares."

164
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:05,196
- Oh, this is so nice.
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,530
Maybe instead of introducing
ourselves to Anu,

166
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:09,879
we could just get a room,

167
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,720
order some food and take a nap.

168
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,520
Yeah, I've fallen
for that line before.

169
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:16,280
It never leads
to napping.

170
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:18,939
That must be her.

171
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,374
Oh. She's cute.

172
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:22,923
Okay, I got you two seats
to <i>Hamilton</i> tonight.

173
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,915
Your tickets will be
at the concierge desk.

174
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,899
Of course.
My pleasure.

175
00:06:27,194 --> 00:06:28,460
May I help you?

176
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,137
Yes, I'm here to pick up
our <i>Hamilton</i> tickets.

177
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,530
Stop.

178
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,523
Hi. We're Raj's friends.

179
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:35,909
I'm Penny.
This is Bernadette.

180
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:37,786
We just came by to
introduce ourselves.

181
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,464
So you came to check me out?

182
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:41,571
She's smart.
I like her.

183
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,821
We just want to see
if we could take you

184
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,393
to dinner
and get to know you a bit.

185
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,796
That sounds nice.
How about tonight after work?

186
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,106
Maybe we can go to Bavel.

187
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:51,651
Oh, I wish.
That place is impossible to get into.

188
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,036
Oh, please.
Getting into impossible places

189
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,605
is my superpower.

190
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:56,799
Me, too.

191
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,759
I can fit my whole body
in our dryer.

192
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:02,069
All set. 8:30.

193
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:04,140
Wow. Okay, well,
we'll see you tonight.

194
00:07:04,218 --> 00:07:05,262
- See you then.
- Okay.

195
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,526
Bye.

196
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,776
She can get
into any restaurant,

197
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,431
but the best husband
she can find is Raj?

198
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:17,257
Not Tam.

199
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:19,593
Not Tam.

200
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,426
Not Tam.

201
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,030
Got him.

202
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,310
- Tam Nguyen?
- Yeah. Yes.

203
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:29,376
Is my son done
with his tour?

204
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:33,120
No idea. We're actually
friends of Sheldon Cooper.

205
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:34,567
Oh, I've been trying
to get in touch with him,

206
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:36,673
but I never heard back.
Is he okay?

207
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:38,496
Well, if you mean
physically, yes.

208
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,923
If you mean
every other way, no.

209
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:43,054
- So, is he here?
- Uh, no.

210
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:44,176
He-he didn't come.

211
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:45,387
He's, uh...

212
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,954
he's still pretty
upset about...

213
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,046
you know.

214
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:51,735
I know what?

215
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,649
Come on,
you-you-you must know.

216
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,267
No, we haven't talked in,
like, 20 years.

217
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:59,446
Right. Because...

218
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:01,366
you know.

219
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,665
I don't think
he knows.

220
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:06,501
What are you guys talking about?

221
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:09,671
Why did you and Sheldon
stop being friends?

222
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,020
- What did you do?
- And don't worry,

223
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:12,072
even though we
just met you,

224
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,595
we think you're right
and he's wrong.

225
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,757
I didn't do anything.

226
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,038
He moved to California,
and we just drifted apart.

227
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,972
Oh, come on, there's
got to be something...

228
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,452
What's going on, here,

229
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,608
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

230
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:26,587
- We just met...
- Sheldon! So good to see you!

231
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,421
Tam.

232
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,676
It's been a long time.

233
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:33,603
Mm, not long enough
to erase the sting of betrayal.

234
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,173
How did I betray you?

235
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,840
You know what you did.

236
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:38,732
Uh, let me
catch you up.

237
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,095
He does not.

238
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,104
When I moved to California,
what did you do?

239
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:45,325
I stayed in Texas.

240
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:47,603
Do you believe this guy?!

241
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:53,856
So, he was your best friend
growing up?

242
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:54,921
Yes.

243
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,501
Were there no other kids
in Texas?

244
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:06,219
Hey.
What is going on with you?

245
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:07,638
I don't want to talk about it.

246
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:10,616
Well, I'm sure you have
a perfectly stupid reason.

247
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:13,859
I don't do anything
for a stupid reason.

248
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,674
Except, perhaps,
Talk Like a Pirate Day,

249
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:18,030
and I'd argue that's
more whimsical than stupid.

250
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:21,386
You know, I was curious to find
out what Tam had done wrong.

251
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:23,898
Why am I not surprised
the answer is nothing?

252
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:25,617
So you're taking his side.

253
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:28,047
You scurvy dog.

254
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,350
You watch yourself.
There is room on my enemies list

255
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:32,988
now that the cafeteria ladies
finally told me

256
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,470
what's in the chili.

257
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:37,033
By the way, don't eat the chili.

258
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:38,536
Wai-Wai-Wait, you know what?

259
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:39,726
Do.

260
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:42,268
Be careful, Sheldon.

261
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:44,947
I don't think you can afford
to lose a second best friend.

262
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:47,458
I don't see anyone lining up
to be your third.

263
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,133
D... Wait.

264
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,611
"Snarky comebacks..."

265
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:54,344
Oh, here we go.

266
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:56,443
"You have your entire life
to be a jerk,

267
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:58,713
why not take today off?"

268
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:06,062
That was harsh,
but he was asking for it.

269
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,201
This place is amazing.

270
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,768
I can't believe
you got us in here.

271
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,505
Well, it's kind of my job.

272
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,166
Usually I get tipped for it,
but I'll leave that up to you.

273
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,972
Look, I think that's
LeBron over there.

274
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,083
James?

275
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,156
No, LeBron Kershenbaum.

276
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,466
So, what do you want to know?

277
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:27,732
Well, you seem like a
smart, successful woman,

278
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,171
why would you want to marry
someone you just met?

279
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:31,612
Fair question.

280
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,081
In my 20s, I tried this
the normal way.

281
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,226
You know, met a guy,
fell in love,

282
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,366
we moved in together.

283
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:40,003
I put him through culinary
school, screenwriting classes,

284
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:43,203
and finally dumped him when he
wanted to become a midwife.

285
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,459
Then I realized,

286
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:48,281
my parents are happy;
they had an arranged marriage.

287
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,359
Why am I fighting this?

288
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,554
I dunno, I married for love

289
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:55,929
and it turned out... fine.

290
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,187
Oh, yeah, me, too.

291
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,683
Hi.

292
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,696
Howard, today
is your lucky day.

293
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:09,687
Leonard's out,
you're my new best friend.

294
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,448
Well, I'm not
thrilled about it either,

295
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:13,890
but here we are.

296
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,083
Okay, fine.

297
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:16,451
Is Bernadette there?

298
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:17,639
Sh... No.

299
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:19,078
Just Stuart?

300
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:20,882
Let me call you back.

301
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,670
Let me guess.

302
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,357
This thing with Tam escalated,

303
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,589
and now you're mad at Leonard

304
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,257
and looking for
a new best friend?

305
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:28,693
You know me so well.

306
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,052
It's too bad you can't be
my best friend.

307
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:32,730
I can be.

308
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:35,120
You can't be my wife
and my best friend.

309
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:37,328
Who would I complain
about you to?

310
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,726
Just tell me what happened.

311
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,295
Leonard talked to Tam behind
my back and took his side.

312
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:45,480
And after what he did to me.
Can you believe it?

313
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:48,263
No. I'm-I'm shocked
and outraged.

314
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,288
Now, tell me why
I'm shocked and outraged.

315
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:53,537
Fine.

316
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,865
When I got accepted
to grad school at Caltech,

317
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:59,127
I was afraid to move
so far away from home.

318
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:01,511
So Tam said
he'd move out here with me

319
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,085
and be my roommate.
Then,

320
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:05,161
over the summer,
he got a girlfriend,

321
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,948
even after reading
all the pamphlets

322
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,413
I gave him
about social diseases.

323
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,609
Aw, I remember when
you gave me those pamphlets.

324
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,599
Anyway, Tam stayed
with her in Texas,

325
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:18,089
and I had to move out here
all by myself.

326
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:20,945
That must've been scary.

327
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,404
It was.

328
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,318
I was lonely, and I thought

329
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:25,796
I'd never make a friend again.

330
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:28,234
And for a long time,
I didn't.

331
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:29,905
But then you did.

332
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,540
And great friends.

333
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:32,874
If you think about it,

334
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,119
if Tam had moved out here
with you,

335
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:37,847
who knows what your life
would've been like.

336
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:45,138
Yes.

337
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:47,220
Uh, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.
I called you

338
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,772
- about the apartment. You said...
- Tell him to go away.

339
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,722
You already have a roommate.

340
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:54,870
New neighbor?

341
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:56,171
Oh, hi.

342
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:57,285
- Hi.
- Hi.

343
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:59,222
- Hi.
- Hi.

344
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,953
Tam, look.

345
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:12,909
Sheldon's hugging me.

346
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:16,847
It's a Saturnalia miracle.

347
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,777
Sheldon, come here.

348
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,970
Bazinga.

349
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:26,472
No, my life
would've still been great.

350
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,022
So what is the craziest
request anyone's ever made?

351
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,009
Oh, you know,
I can't really say.

352
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:35,897
Concierge-guest confidentiality.

353
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,416
Really, that's a thing?

354
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,064
No.

355
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,818
This one time, I had to go
to Walmart at 3:00 a.m.

356
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,952
because Britney Spears
needed to blow bubbles.

357
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,386
- Oh.
- That is so cool.

358
00:13:48,648 --> 00:13:51,186
By the way, do not tell Raj
that you met Britney Spears,

359
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,386
because he will literally die.

360
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:57,237
We've been talking so much
about me,

361
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,104
tell me about Raj.

362
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:00,772
Okay, are you trying
to get us drunk

363
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,173
so we'll dish on
our friend?

364
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:04,698
'Cause it's totally gonna work,
what do you want to know?

365
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:07,561
What kind of guy is he?

366
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,634
He is great.

367
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:09,897
- So great.
- Mm-hmm.

368
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,722
How come he's still single?

369
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:15,183
- He's great.
- So great. Yeah.

370
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,579
Come on.

371
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:18,259
There's really nothing
to tell.

372
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:19,553
Raj is so much fun
to hang out with.

373
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:20,921
He's like one
of our girlfriends.

374
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,513
And I mean that in a good way.

375
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:24,464
But also a bad way.

376
00:14:24,957 --> 00:14:26,908
Anything else?

377
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:29,088
- No.
- No.

378
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:31,733
I mean, h-he
takes baths with his dog,

379
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:33,730
but not in a weird way.

380
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:37,019
Or a normal way;
they both wear swimsuits.

381
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:41,047
He also cries every time
Hugh Jackman sings.

382
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:44,800
But not cute sniffles...
Full-on snot sobs.

383
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,046
But he is great.

384
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:48,862
- So great.
- Yeah.

385
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:53,899
Hello, Sheldon.

386
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,210
Hello Tam.
Thank you for coming.

387
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:59,323
I just want you to know
that, um...

388
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:01,409
I forgive you.

389
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:02,811
I didn't do anything.

390
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:04,163
And yet, here I am,

391
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:06,198
still being the bigger man.

392
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:09,111
Look, I was in love with Beth,

393
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:10,252
and she made me happy.

394
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,573
Y... Really?

395
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:13,722
Did <i>she</i> let you play
with her train set?

396
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:17,417
In a manner of speaking.

397
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,767
Sheldon, I needed
to stay in Texas.

398
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,329
And you needed
to come here.

399
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,408
I knew you were gonna
do amazing things,

400
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:28,703
and meet amazing people
who were gonna respect you,

401
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:31,217
because you're brilliant.
And because they never had to

402
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:33,347
fish you out of a dumpster.

403
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,975
Well, they have,
but it was during

404
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:37,175
my short-lived parkour phase.

405
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,386
I didn't mean to upset you.

406
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,569
And I want you to know
I'm really proud

407
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:44,128
of everything you've done.

408
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:45,587
Thank you.

409
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,730
It did work out for me.

410
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,237
And I'm sorry that things
didn't work out for you.

411
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:53,395
They did work out for me.

412
00:15:53,473 --> 00:15:56,550
Oh, Tam, you don't need
to be brave on my account.

413
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:58,020
I'm not.

414
00:15:58,098 --> 00:16:00,858
I have a great wife
and amazing children.

415
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,362
I'm very happy.

416
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,761
Brave, brave Tam.

417
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,178
Sounds like Penny and
Bernadette had fun last night.

418
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:12,214
I know.
Bernie came home pretty drunk.

419
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:14,659
She tried to sleep in the dryer.

420
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:20,962
Hello, you all remember Tam,
my best friend from high school.

421
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,522
- Yeah. - Of course.
- How's it going?

422
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,389
Sheldon's been showing
me and my son around.

423
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:26,566
Now we know where all
the clean bathrooms are.

424
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:27,697
Yep.

425
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:29,097
You just remember
the mnemonic:

426
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:30,854
if it's number one,
the library's fun,

427
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:33,272
if it's number two,
the basement's for you.

428
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,733
I'm glad you guys made up.

429
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,247
Well, I realized my life
turned out great,

430
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:39,893
and it's silly
to hold a grudge.

431
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,819
And I had no idea we were
fighting, so it was easy.

432
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:44,838
Uh, don't worry, Leonard,

433
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,194
you're still
my California best friend.

434
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:50,216
Cool.

435
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:52,861
So, what do you want to do now?

436
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:55,106
Go to the train store,
go to the comic book store?

437
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:57,592
Actually, I have to grab my
son and head to the airport.

438
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,247
I was just about
to call a cab.

439
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,606
Don't be silly,
you don't have to call a cab.

440
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:02,815
You're my oldest friend.

441
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:04,921
Leonard will take you.
Right, Leonard?

442
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,199
Sure.

443
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:09,391
Shall we?

444
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:10,638
Eh, eh, eh, hold on.

445
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:12,088
I haven't seen
Tam in 20 years,

446
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,881
give me a chance
to say good-bye.

447
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:15,840
Bye.

448
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,216
Check it out...
LeBron James posted a picture

449
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,368
of me and him
on Instagram.

450
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:26,582
I don't see you.

451
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,111
Look right behind him.

452
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:29,317
No.

453
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,556
Okay. You see that table
just past his left shoulder?

454
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,357
Now go back two more tables
and over to the right.

455
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,322
All I see is
a yellow smudge.

456
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,816
That's me!

457
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,506
Oh, it's Raj.

458
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,642
Hey Raj,
I'm here with Penny.

459
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,365
<i>What the hell did you two
say to Anu?</i>

460
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,746
Uh...

461
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,209
whatever do you mean?

462
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,803
<i>Why, why would you tell her</i>

463
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,766
<i>I wear ladies' deodorant?</i>

464
00:17:55,844 --> 00:18:00,089
Uh, because you're a boy
and it's really funny.

465
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:02,043
<i>Oh, oh, okay. Pardon me</i>

466
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:05,107
<i>for having the confidence
to smell daisy-fresh.</i>

467
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:09,248
Just do me a favor
and stay away from her.

468
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:13,173
Ugh, God, now I feel bad.

469
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,353
I know.

470
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,801
Maybe we should
take her out again

471
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:17,009
and do some damage control.

472
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,626
You know, that's a good idea.

473
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:20,951
Think she can
get us into SoHo House?

474
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:23,900
I don't know,
but we owe it

475
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,092
- to Raj to try.
- Mm-hmm.
