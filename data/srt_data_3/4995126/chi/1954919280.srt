你还想喝一口我的沙冰呢

00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:12,206
这是个以弱胜强的故事
Okay, so it's a, it's a David and Goliath story.

154
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,374
讲的是凡人面对神
It's about man against God.

155
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,161
歌名叫"锤子和鞭子:
It's called "Hammer and Whip:

156
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:18,412
"索尔和印第安纳·琼斯
"The Untold Story

157
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:22,082
不为人知的故事"
of Thor versus Indiana Jones."

158
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,336
索尔和印第安纳·琼斯?
Thor versus Indiana Jones?

159
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:29,389
你让我大"科"眼界了
You just blew my filking mind.

160
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,009
我还没全部写完
Okay, I don't have it all worked out yet,

161
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:34,678
我现在只有个大概...
but I was thinking something like, um...

162
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,301
# 哦 印第 #
# Oh, Indy #

163
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:39,355
# 哦 印第 #
# Oh, Indy #

164
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:43,817
# 天空风起 #
# The skies are so windy #

165
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,418
# 那人在飞 像杀手一样 #
# Is that a flying man with a killer bod #

166
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,534
# 等等 #
# Wait #

167
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,832
# 那不是人 #
# That's no man #

168
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,791
# 那是挪威的神 #
# It's a Norse god. #

169
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:57,360
太好了
Oh yes, definitely.

170
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:58,467
等等
Hang on.

171
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:06,656
# 索尔举起了锤 电闪雷鸣 #
# Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer #

172
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:13,621
# 印第唱到 真狂霸酷拽叼 #
# Indy rapped, "That's one bad mamma-jamma." #

173
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:16,070
这... 太好了!
That... that is so good!

174
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:16,453
对吧?
Right?

175
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,333
我就这么想到了
Mamma-jamma just came to me.

176
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,272
接下来是副歌
Okay, and here's the hook.

177
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:24,777
# 索尔和琼斯博士 #
# Thor and Dr. Jones #

178
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,384
# 索尔和琼斯博士 #
# Thor and Dr. Jones #

179
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,262
# 一个玩闪电 #
# One plays with lightning #

180
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:32,253
# 一个玩骨头 #
# The other plays with bones #

181
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:36,267
# 索尔和琼斯博士 #
# Thor and Dr. Jones #

182
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:39,188
# 索尔和琼斯博士 #
# Thor and Dr. Jones #

183
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:40,903
# 一个玩闪电 #
# One plays with lightning #

184
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:44,486
# 另一个玩骨头 #
# The other plays with bones #

185
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,600
天啊 太好听了
Oh, man. That rocks.

186
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,448
嘿 还记得消失的约柜(圣经故事)吗?
Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,049
- 怎么了?  - 凡听我们表演者皆会把膝盖献上
- Yeah?  - That's how much we're gonna melt people's faces off.

188
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,841
很感谢你对公寓有兴趣
I appreciate your interest in the apartment.

189
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,294
我只需要问你几个常规问题
I just need to ask you a few standard questions.

190
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,962
- 好的  - 表上说你是个化学家
- Sure.  - It says here you're a chemist.

191
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:06,265
你觉得元素周期表里
Which element on the periodic table

192
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:09,885
哪个元素的裤子太小了?
do you feel is too big for its britches?

193
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,472
你是在讲笑话吗?
Is that supposed to be a joke?

194
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,975
看来氩(惰性气体)不是唯一一个
Looks like argon's not the only one

195
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:18,611
态度有问题的
with an attitude problem.

196
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:20,196
通常来说
In general,

197
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,648
你是比现在好闻些 难闻些
would you say that you smell better, worse

198
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,285
还是差不多呢?
or the same as you do right now?

199
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,205
我本想问你
I was going to ask you

200
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:30,990
最好的水果是什么
what is the best fruit,

201
00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:32,825
但后来意识到我想问你的是
but then I realized what I want to ask you

202
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:35,211
为什么你的前臂上有创可贴
is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm,

203
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:36,162
但再后来发现
but then I realized what

204
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:37,546
我真的想跟你说的是
I really want to ask you is

205
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:39,415
你能走吗?
just can you just go?

206
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,802
你很健康
You're healthy.

207
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:44,670
你在科学界工作
You have a job in the sciences.

208
00:08:44,672 --> 00:08:47,173
我不得不说 如果信用报告反馈好的话
I've got to say, if this credit report comes back good,

209
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:48,591
你是优先候选人
you're the frontrunner.

210
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,264
我不会当你室友的 Sheldon
I'm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.

211
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:57,850
但我已经见了十一个人了
But I met with 11 people,

212
00:08:57,852 --> 00:08:59,402
他们都不行
and they all walked out.

213
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,103
而那个势利眼Chris Pratt
And that Hollywood phony Chris Pratt

214
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,105
推特上没理我
never tweeted me back.

215
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,741
你肯定能找到别人的
I'm sure you'll find somebody else.

216
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:07,576
但愿吧
I suppose.

217
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:08,944
我这是怎么了 Amy?
What happened to me, Amy?

218
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:10,196
几年前
Years ago I was

219
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:12,498
我跟自己的感情是完全脱离的
completely disengaged from my feelings.

220
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,083
我想说那个时候更开心
I'd say it was a happier time,

221
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:18,037
但我跟感情脱离了 谁知道呢?
but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?

222
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,373
我不知道该怎么帮你
I don't know how to help you.

223
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,625
感情是生活的一部分
You know, feelings are a part of life.

224
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:24,243
以前不是
They didn't used to be.

225
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,045
你和Leonard和Penny
You and Leonard and Penny,

226
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,047
你们用感情荼毒了我
you all poisoned me with emotions.

227
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,266
{\an8}(出自绿野仙踪)

228
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,266
我就像铁皮人 在恶巫师给他心之前
I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content

229
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,385
无忧无虑地生活着
until that evil Wizard gave him a heart.

230
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:37,773
电影的主题不是这个吧
I don't think that was the point of the movie.

231
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,358
好吧 那我就是被怪人杰佩托(老木工)
Fine, then I was like Pinocchio

232
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,878
变成真正的男孩之前的匹诺曹
before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.

233
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,947
这才对嘛
There you go.

234
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:48,984
你晚饭想吃什么?
So, what are you thinking for dinner?

235
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:50,069
今晚是泰国菜之夜
Well, it's Thai food night.

236
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:51,237
亲爱的
Well, honey,

237
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,455
你不再跟着Sheldon住了
you don't live with Sheldon anymore.

238
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:54,123
你想吃什么都可以
You can have anything you want.

239
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,409
你说得对
You're right.

240
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:57,660
但吃什么呢?
But what?

241
00:09:58,746 --> 00:09:59,795
墨西哥菜?
Mexican?

242
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:01,213
意大利菜? 德国菜?
Italian? German?

243
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:02,548
印度菜? 希腊菜?
Indian? Greek?

244
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,749
古巴菜? 中餐?
Cuban? Chinese?

245
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,750
披萨? 烧烤?
Pizza? Barbecue?

246
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:07,636
韩国菜? 韩国烧烤?
Korean? Korean barbecue?

247
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:09,755
吃泰国菜怎么样?
How about Thai food?

248
00:10:09,757 --> 00:10:11,474
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God

249
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,846
嘿 我们要去吃晚饭 你要来吗?
Hey, we're going to dinner. You want to come?

250
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,597
哦 我很想去
Oh, I wish I could,

251
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:21,734
但我意识到我变得情绪太脆弱了
but I realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable,

252
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,819
所以 就像操作系统一样
so, like an operating system,

253
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,906
我要把生活恢复到最近一个稳定的版本
I'm restoring my life to the last stable version,

254
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:30,025
也就是2003年 我见到Leonard的前一天
which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.

255
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:33,446
你听见了 他不去
You heard him, no.

256
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:34,780
等下
Hang on.

257
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:37,116
慢着 你真的以为现在2003年?
Wait, you actually think it's 2003?

258
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:39,118
不 虽然我要过跟十二年前一样的生活
No, just because I'm living my life

259
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,454
但我并没有精神失常
like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional.

260
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:43,255
而既然现在是2003年
And since it is 2003,

261
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:45,007
我不认识你
I don't know who you are,

262
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,959
所以请在我用最新款翻盖手机报警前
so please exit the premises

263
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:49,462
离开这里
before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.

264
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:06,023
你还好吧?
Are you doing okay?

265
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:07,625
应该吧
I guess.

266
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:09,860
我只是担心Sheldon
I'm just, you know, worried about Sheldon.

267
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:11,629
别这样 他是个在假装自己二十岁的
Well, come on, he's a grown man in his 30s

268
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,297
三十岁的大人了
pretending to be a grown man in his 20s.

269
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,331
他没事的
He's fine.

270
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:17,701
但愿吧
I hope so.

271
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,737
你还能怎么样? 搬回去接着和他住吗?
What else can you do? Move back in with him?

272
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:21,155
不可能 我...我就是觉得这样不太好
No, of course not. I... I just feel bad.

273
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:22,456
我也这么觉得
Well, so do I,

274
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,708
但是你难道不想过和老婆住在一起
but don't you want to live with your wife

275
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,243
而且空调的温度
and set the thermostat

276
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,328
自己说了算的日子吗
to whatever you want

277
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,963
而且你想什么时候去洗手间
and have your body tell you

278
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,498
就什么时候去
when it's time to go to the bathroom,

279
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,665
而不用遵守每天早上
you know, not a schedule slipped

280
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,168
从门缝下面塞进来的时间表
underneath your door every morning?

281
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,221
其实我还挺喜欢时间表上的天气预报的
I did like that he had the weather on it.

282
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:40,925
你要相信 这样做是对的
Trust me, this is the right thing.

283
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,343
我知道
I know.

284
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:43,761
而且我们也不是抛弃了他
And it's not like we're abandoning him.

285
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:45,012
另外
Plus,

286
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:47,348
我们随时都可以跟他视频通话
we can FaceTime him whenever we want,

287
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,101
只要他那个世界里有人发明了苹果手机就好
you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.

288
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:57,191
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe Sheldon

289
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,626
Sheldon居然让你做他的室友
asked you to be his roommate.

290
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:02,296
我不敢相信他居然去查我的信用记录
I can't believe he ran my credit.

291
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,748
嘿 你要是想找个人合租的话
Hey, if you're open to living with someone great,

292
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,017
我给你一千刀求你带走Stuart
I'll give you $1,000 to take Stuart.

293
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:10,120
在把这种生物领回家之前
You really should've gone on the Internet

294
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,039
真的应该上网好好查查
and checked how long that kind of thing lives

295
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,974
它能活多久
before you got one.

296
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:15,509
对不起
I'm sorry.

297
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:16,760
我只是觉得 你生命中可能有一个
I just thought you might have

298
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:19,697
需要面色苍白的怪咖来填补的空洞
a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.

299
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,049
我知道Sheldon有点怪
Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky,

300
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,684
可是他很聪明 又很有见地
but he's also brilliant and insightful.

301
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:27,721
我觉得把他叫做怪咖有点不合适吧
I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.

302
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,974
2003年的生活 我回来了!
Hello, 2003!

303
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:34,895
嗨 我们给你买了泰国菜
Hey, we brought you Thai.

304
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,399
家具都去哪了?
Where is everything?

305
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,317
对于现在的我来说 它们都在未来
In my present, it's in the future.

306
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,903
对于现在的你来说 我在建材城的停车场里
In your present, it's been crammed in the bedroom

307
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:44,371
找了个有上进心的年轻人
by an enterprising young man

308
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:47,124
帮我都搬进卧室堆着了
I met in The Home Depot parking lot.

309
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:49,910
我明白你在干什么
I know what you're doing.

310
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,912
你想引起我们的注意 让我们对你感到愧疚
You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you,

311
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:53,414
不过这不可能
but it's not happening.

312
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,249
不 我只是想知道 所有人都离开我之后
No, what I'm doing is trying to figure out

313
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:57,918
我应该怎么一个人生活
how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.

314
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,170
你真是够了 我们就住在走廊对面
Will you knock it off? We're across the hall.

315
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:02,840
就像现在年轻人常说的那样 "跟我的手说吧" (意为 我不听)
As the kids are saying today, "Talk to the hand."

316
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,427
他们可不这么说
They're not saying that.

317
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:09,496
2003年的时候他们会这么说的
They are in 2003.

318
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,016
不 真的不会
No, they're really not.

319
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:17,944
# 索尔和琼斯博士 #
# Thor and Dr. Jones #

320
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:20,505
# 索尔和琼斯博士 #
#Thor and Dr. Jones #

321
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,010
# 一个离开了洛基 #
# One runs from Loki #

322
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:25,669
# 一个离开了圣石 #
# The other runs from stones. #

323
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,196
你觉得怎么样?
So, what do you think?

324
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,447
哇哦
Wow.

325
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,550
离开了圣石说的是...那个大石块
Runs from stones means that... that big boulder,

326
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:35,719
可是我找不到跟大石块押韵的词
but I couldn't rhyme anything with boulder.

327
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:39,640
{\an8}(英文中都押韵)

328
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:38,138
湿冷 时间
Colder, shoulder,

329
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,640
士兵 文件...
soldier, folder...

330
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:41,358
好吧 好吧 你说的对
Right, yeah, right.

331
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,893
但是...
But...

332
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,728
你觉得怎么样嘛?
what do you think?

333
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,613
我觉得 挺可爱的
I think it's very cute.

334
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,231
可爱? 这不是可爱
Cute? It's not cute.

335
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:51,118
可爱说的是那些打扮成蔬菜的小孩
Cute is children dressed as vegetables.

336
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:55,956
好吧好吧 不是可爱
Okay, fine, it's not cute.

337
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,491
说实话 你根本就不喜欢对不对
Just be honest. You don't like it.

338
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:58,659
我可没这么说
I didn't say that.

339
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:01,044
我... 我只是更喜欢那种能跟着跳舞的音乐
I... I just like music you can dance to.

340
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:02,879
这个也可以跳舞啊！
You can dance to this!

341
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,831
呃 这样...
Um, uh, uh...

342
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,732
# 索尔和琼斯博士 #
# Thor and Dr. Jones #

343
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,287
# 索尔和琼斯博士 #
# Thor and Dr. Jones #

344
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,620
# 一个玩闪电 #
# One plays with lightning #

345
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:15,849
# 一个玩骨头 #
# The other plays with bones. #

346
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,679
嘿 你听我说 这首歌有点问题
I'm telling you, dude, the song has no groove.

347
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:19,991
你没办法跟着它跳舞
You can't dance to it.

348
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,156
那又怎样?
Who cares?

349
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:23,991
我觉得"月球上的脚印"要做的音乐是
I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon

350
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,494
它能启发人们的思考
was to write songs that make people think.

351
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,962
可以一举两得啊
You can do both,

352
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,498
就像迈克尔·杰克逊的"Billie Jean"
like Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean."

353
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,666
你可以一边跳舞 一边思考 
While you're dancing you're thinking, like,

354
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,301
"该死 这到底是哪个妹子?"
"Darn it, whose baby is it?"

355
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,339
你怎么会有这种想法?
Where's this coming from?

356
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:40,758
几个小时之前 我们都超爱这首歌的
A few hours ago, we both loved this song.

357
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,176
我现在也超爱它
I still love it.

358
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:44,145
我觉得还有提升空间
I just think there's room for improvement.

359
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:46,764
你弹给Emily听了 是不是?
You played it for Emily, didn't you?

360
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,516
- 是啊 那又怎样?  - 你太没主见了
- Yeah, so what?  - You are such a wimp.

361
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:51,102
她不喜欢 现在你也不喜欢了
She didn't like it, now you don't like it.

362
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:54,188
才不是 作为一个音乐家我需要进步
No, no. I'm just evolving as a musician.

363
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,691
你才是拘泥在过去的那个人
You're the one who's stuck in the past.

364
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:59,360
你说的过去就在中午!
The past was lunch!

365
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:03,080
你知不知道现在是什么情况?
You know what's really happening here?

366
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:06,033
你的女朋友在破坏我们的乐队
Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.

367
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:08,869
她和乐队没有关系
She has nothing to do with this.

368
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:10,204
我的想法我做主
I am my own man.

369
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:11,706
拜托 明明是谁愿意和你睡觉
Oh, please. Your brain belongs

370
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,874
你的脑子就是谁的
to whoever's willing to sleep with you.

371
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,126
- 这太扯了  - 是吗?
- That is so not true.  - Really?

372
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,544
还记得那次你要为Rachel Bernstein
Remember when you were gonna get circumcised

373
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:18,763
割包皮的事儿吗?
for Rachel Bernstein?

374
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:21,215
那事和Rachel没有关系
That had nothing to do with Rachel.

375
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:24,068
那事是裤拉链坏了导致的过激反应
It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.

376
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,556
我不想继续了
I don't need this.

377
00:15:28,558 --> 00:15:30,641
我要退出乐队!
I'm quitting the band!

378
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:31,942
行啊 我也退出!
Fine, I quit, too!

379
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,394
那就滚出我家!
Then get out of my house!

380
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,479
乐意之极!
With pleasure!

381
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:44,455
Raj 等等
Raj, wait.

382
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,540
你怎么让我等了这么久?
What took you so long?

383
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:50,161
兄弟 我知道
Buddy, I know me

384
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:52,546
我搬去Penny家对你来说是个大变化
moving in with Penny feels like a big change,

385
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:53,814
但这并不是
but it's not.

386
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,049
你怎么可以这么说?
How can you say that?

387
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,016
Amy离开我了
Amy's gone,

388
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:57,718
你俩又结婚了
and you two are married now,

389
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,421
所以你俩要离开也只是时间问题
so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.

390
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:01,756
你根本不知道会发生什么
Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.

391
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,007
不 我知道
No, I do.

392
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,592
以后你俩会想要更大的空间
Eventually you'll want more space,

393
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:05,976
接着就会搬进一座房子
and you'll move into a house,

394
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:08,179
接着本来是一周几次的聚餐
and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week,

395
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,647
变成了一月几次
it'll only be a couple of times a month,

396
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:10,848
最后又会变成
and then it'll only be

397
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,233
特殊时间才会相聚
on special occasions,

398
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:15,352
比如Bernadette和Wolowitz离婚的时候
like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz.

399
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,105
或... 或者
Or... or... or like

400
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:19,657
在Koothrappali那个怪胎女朋友
when Koothrappali's weird girlfriend

401
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,992
指认出埋他的尸体的地方
admits where she buried his body.

402
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:25,112
或者 在Amy的婚礼上
Or Amy's wedding,

403
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:27,698
她要嫁给比我还好的人了
where she's marrying someone better than me.

404
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,251
好了 听着
Okay, look,

405
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:32,286
我们不会急着做出下一步行动
we don't need to rush into anything.

406
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:33,621
好吗?
All right?

407
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:36,257
除了Leonard搬去和我住
Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me,

408
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:39,043
其它都保持原样
we just leave things the way they are,

409
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,461
而且...
and...

410
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:42,012
我们会在那边睡几天
sometimes we'll sleep over there,

411
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,348
然后在这边睡几天
and sometimes we'll sleep over here.

412
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,934
但是多数睡在这边
But mostly here.

413
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:49,687
好的
Sure.

414
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,689
那... 那你在餐厅里说的那些呢?
W... W... What about what you said in the restaurant?

415
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:52,723
不会一直这样下去的
Well, it's not forever.

416
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:54,391
暂时而已
It's just for a while.

417
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:57,645
你要是想的话 把他当成我们家的宠物狗好了
If you want, we can think of him like he's our dog.

418
00:16:57,647 --> 00:16:59,697
可以 可以
You can.

419
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:02,116
你们回家了我会摇头晃尾
I'm happy when you come home.

420
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:05,486
而且我害怕烟花
And I'm scared of fireworks.

421
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:08,989
顺便说一句 七月四日我们都睡这边(美国独立日)
And by the way, on July Fourth, we're all sleeping here.

422
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:11,242
好吧
Fine.

423
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:12,326
好的 太好了!
All right, great!

424
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:13,627
给我一分钟
Just give me one minute,

425
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:15,713
然后我再开始准备室友协议
and I'll get started on a new Roommate Agreement.

426
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:16,881
好的
Yeah.

427
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:18,048
Pratt没给我回消息 没问题了
Nothing from Pratt. We're good.

428
