00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,520
Hello.

2
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,720
Just tell me what's happened.

3
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
And what is it?

4
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,240
I'll be right down.

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,440
What's happened?

6
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,719
Susannah.

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,919
Susannah?

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,159
Princess Susannah.

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Is she all right?

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,480
Don't know.

11
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,880
'Don't kill me.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,959
'Please don't kill me.'

13
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,359
'Read the statement.

14
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,720
'Yes. All right.

'Please.'

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,640
What are you doing? Keep it going.

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,039
Prime Minister, at this point,
I think it's important to say

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,119
that we are 100% certain

31
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,359
that this is, indeed,

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,320
Princess Susannah.

33
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:27,199
Her car was intercepted shortly after midnight,
returning from the wedding of a college friend.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,399
She'd insisted on going.

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,520
But you had security on her?

36
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,959
Two PPOs, still unconscious.

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,919
Heavy sedative, close range,
each with a single puncture wound.

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,999
No sign of struggle.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,160
What do they want? Money?

40
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,719
Release the Jihadi?

41
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,920
Scrap Third World debt?

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,599
Save the fucking libraries?

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,199
We are convinced both the video and
the demand it contains are genuine.

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,120
What demand?

45
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,960
What Susannah says next...

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
It concerns you directly, sir.

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,440
Just play it.

48
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,799
'There is only one demand,
and it is a simple one.

49
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,119

'I don't understand!'

The video ends with a series of technical
specifications for the broadcast.

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,800
Why are you doing this?

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,479
"Mike!"

59
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,160
It's real.

60
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,839
She said pig.

61
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,800
Sex with a pig.

62
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,639
They want me to have sex with a pig?

63
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,639
Live on television

65
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,879
But what...? Who...?

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,999
We're checking with embedded operatives,
compiling a list of suspects.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,759
Meanwhile, the demand has been made.

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,079
There's not long
to formulate our response.

69
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,320
Well, I'm not fucking a pig!

70
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,719
Page one, that's not happening.

71
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
Of course.

72
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,640
Absolutely, sir.

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
Well, have we established a dialogue
with this...?

74
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,799
We can't. There's no
e-mail address, no code word.

75
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,480
No channel for negotiation.

76
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:28,479
So we focus on finding Susannah.
We get her back.

77
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,439
However it's done, I don't care.
We stop this now.

78
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,759
Everyone's working towards this.

79
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,679
Yes. No. Not everyone. A dedicated
core team. This can't go wide.

80
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,599
Keep it so far from the press
it's on the other side of Jupiter.

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,519
This only exists in this room.

82
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,640
It's already outside it.

83
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,479
If there are hacks sniffing around,

84
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,919
Super fucking Godzilla injunction
with ten-inch Whitehall fangs!

85
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,800
This video came from YouTube.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,519
What?

87
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,359
It was uploaded via an encrypted IP
an hour ago.

88
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
Well, get it off there!

89
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:13,319
We did after nine minutes, long enough
for it to be duplicated and spread.

90
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,759
Spread?
How many people have seen this?

91
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,519
We take down one,
six clones pop up elsewhere.

92
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,200
How many people?

93
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:24,480
50,000. That's our current estimate.

94
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,599
The news rooms have got it.

95
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,680
They're running this on air?

96
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:33,479
No. We put a type five D notice out
and they're complying.

97
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,079
For now.

98
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,880
It's trending on Twitter.

99
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:39,160

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,399
What now? What's the play book?

101
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,519
This is virgin territory,
Prime Minister.

102
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,640
There's no play book.

103
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,159

104
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,159

we're not covering it. How do I reply?

You don't.

121
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,079

That is totally backwards.

Least I can do is warn Tom.

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,439
Nothing. Must be a hoax.

179
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,479
They'll be asking for
a million quid or something.

180
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,759
They want him to do it with a pig.

181
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,839
Telegraph has the whole video and an
interactive timeline. Tonally stark.

182
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,879
Brief mention of the ransom being
"a sex act". Nothing too gross.

183
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,319
Sun runs with "Taken".
Big grab of Susannah...

184
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,520
Of course I still want that drink.

185
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:01,359
Then give me something.

186
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,159
That won't be possible.

187
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm friendly when I drink.
Very friendly when I'm grateful.

188
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,039
The Guardian are running
a fucking live blog

189
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,919
and a short piece on
the historical symbolism of the pig.

190
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,039
'..Only five hours away,

'They're all sexual deviants,
all MPs and Prime Ministers.'

00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,320
We've been squeezing hard,
but nothing concrete.

203
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,918
It won't come to that.

204
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,080

They're surrounding the place now.

00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:50,200
Where?

208
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,159
What?

209
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,119
Where's the place?

210
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,520
Truro.

211
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:56,319
Why are you lying? You're lying!

212
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,799
Truro? Jesus!

213
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,639
I don't want you worrying.

214
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,519
You've never patronised me.
Don't start now.

215
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,998
Whoever this is, is insane.

216
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,478
And has a princess.

217
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,280
We'll get through this.

218
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,759
Not any princess... the princess.

219
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,919
Princess bloody Facebook bloody
eco-conscious national sweetheart.

220
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,160
I won't have to do anything.

221
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,438
Everyone's laughing at us.

222
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,560
You don't know that.

223
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:23,119
I know people.

224
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,119
We love humiliation.

225
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,480
Nothing is going to happen.

226
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,799
It's already happening
in their heads.

227
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,400
In their heads, that's what you're
doing, what my husband is doing.

228
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,439
Please!

229
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,040
Jane.

230
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,559
What?

231
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,520
Palace on the phone, sir.

232
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:54,559
Get Alex to stall them.

233
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,999
She's already been speaking to her
for ten minutes.

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,199
"Her"?

235
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,040
It's the Queen herself.

236
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Go on.

237
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,359
'As the 4pm deadline draws nearer,
the world holds its breath... '

238
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,439

239
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,839
It's on the list.

240
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,719
List of rules,
specifies camera angles and things.

241
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,719
It's not like Dogme 95.

242
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,839
What's Dogme 95?

243
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,200
Cinematic movement.

244
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,359
Lars von Trier.

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,319
Rules for a director... no background music,
only natural light, for authenticity.

246
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,039
Same as these, so they can't cheat,
cut another guy's arse pumping away.

247

Steer them away
from the grisly details.

252

'Let's not dwell
on any of the details.

"I trust you'll do everything
in your power to get her back."

257
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,839
And we are.

258
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,959
It wasn't a collective "you".
It was a singular "you", ie me.

259
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,799
Sir, we may have something. Jamie's
been tracing the video's origin.

260
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I thought it was untraceable.

261
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,839
Algorithm.

262
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,639
Anyway, we also know
it was uploaded at 3.16am.

263
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:52,039
I ran a nationwide traceback
on uninterrupted one-way uploads

264
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,360
and the closest I can get
is a postcode.

265
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,320
Looks like a campus.

266
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:01,799
Yeah. Closed 2010.

267
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,479
It's been empty since.

268
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,559
Latest i-sat image on this area?

00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,840
3am flyover shot from last night...

270
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,840
Looks like it had lights on.

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,959
We got him. We got him.

272
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,319
Alert the local team.
Full squad. I'll man it.

273
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,960
With helmet-cam relay.
We can watch the operation.

274
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,320
Yes!

275
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,879
Right. Confident?

276
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,039
It's a kick-bollock scramble,
but with finessing it should be OK.

277
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,360
Finesse quickly.
Our performer's on his way.

I wouldn't normally... You know.

280

No.

281
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:05,039
I'm pretty trad... bish, bash, bosh.
In, out.

282
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,799
What do I put on the invoice?
That's what I'm wondering.

283
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,798
There won't be any invoicing.

284
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,920
Oi-oi, Rod!

285
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:12,720
Oi-oi!

286
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,719
Need to prep two statements

287
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,198
Good outcome. Bad outcome.

Yeah. Well...

296
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,119
You need to get into this.

297
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,678
Is there a dressing room I can use?

298
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:10,000
No.

299
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,239
Where's my co-star?

300
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,280
Be rude not to give her a kiss
beforehand.

301
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,600
Outside in the truck.

302
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,520

303
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,560

Strong undercurrent of sympathy.

316

captor, outrage at the whole thing, but not at you.

saying they will, but if they do,

non-compliance.

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,879
I had a back-up plan.

354
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,479
A man prepared to do it and an FX company that
would paint your head onto his shoulders.

355
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,038
You actually
thought that would work?

356
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,360
I believed it worth considering.

357
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:44,719
Then you're a stupid bitch.

358
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,799
With your interest at heart.

359
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,760
Who knew about this?

360
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:51,479
A select few.
It seems some idiot at the studio

361
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,519
recognised our designated performer,

362
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,359
Tweeted a photo and the online
hivemind did the maths.

363
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,839
It's not playing well.

364
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,920
With who?

365
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,319
With... anyone.

366
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,799
'A few hours ago, public opinion
was behind Prime Minister Callow,

367
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,519
'he should fulfil the bizarre
and illegal request.

368
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,519
'In the wake of these images,

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,079

compared to her suffering.

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,159
'He's just got to do it.

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,559
'What's the alternative?

00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,599
'We can get another Prime Minister.
We can't live without a princess.

They need time...

No more pissing around.

Julian's advising against...

382
00:25:56,761 --> 00:26:01,160
I'm advising for.
They go in now. They go in now.

383
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,679
Where's my obit VT?

384
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,119
What would you say if I said I was
near where Susannah's being held?

385
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,320
I'd say bullshit.

386
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:27,280
Then you'd be wrong.

387
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,439
Have you got a crew with you?

388
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,759
I'm not stupid.

389
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,880
Malaika?

390
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,319
Are you getting this?

391
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,200
Yeah. Don't put yourself
in any danger.

392
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,120
Still getting this?

393
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,520
Yeah. Just stay safe, Malaika.
Be careful!

394
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,479
If this doesn't work...

395
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,520
we need...

396
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,840
Armed police! Lay down on the floor!
Lay down on the floor!

397
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,800
Move!

398
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,320
Fuck!

399
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,159
It's a decoy.

400
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,199
They must have bounced the upload
from here with a proxy. I'm sorry.

401
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,719
Jesus!

402
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,520
They're looking right at her!

403
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:23,479
They can't see her.

404
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,800
'Malaika, make sure they can't... '

405
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:27,800
Stay down! Don't move!

406
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,440
Run, Malaika! Run!

407
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,239
Get out of there. Come on!

408
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,200
Armed police!

409
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,079
Is it him?

410
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,839
Advance! Advance! Advance!

411
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,239
Get down!

412
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,439
UKN. It's Malaika something
or other. She's from UKN.

413
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,400
You press? Yes.

414
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,479
There goes your RTS Award.

415
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,559
There must be something.

416
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,200
There's nothing there, Mike.

417
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:17,719
There'll be a clue.

418
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,760
We've done all we can.

419
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:21,199
You rescued mannequin.

420
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,998
I'm sorry, Michael...

421
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:22,798
Fuck off, Julian!

422
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,520
20 past three. We're out of time.

423
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,079
We're not out of time!

424
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,320
We're not out of time.

425
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,759
It's not going to happen.

426
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,278
To the public...

427
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,160
Fuck the public!

428
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:53,039
To the public, this would be one man
of questionable popularity

429
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,280
putting personal embarrassment
over the life of a girl.

430
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:57,519
She's probably already dead.

431
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,399
If she isn't,
he'll kill her and upload the video.

432
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,399
Everyone will see it.
The world will see it.

433
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,719
The mood will border on insurrection
and you will be destroyed,

434
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,840
I guarantee you...
utterly destroyed.

435
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,680
The polling bears that out.

436
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,679
You won't just be
a disgraced politician,

437
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,799
The public, the Palace and the Party
insist on compliance.

438
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,520
Fuck the Party!

439
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:33,879
Refuse, and I've been advised

440
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,639
that we cannot guarantee
your physical safety.

441
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,960
Or that of your family.

442
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,640
I've made arrangements
for the broadcast.

443
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,760
I can't...

444
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:02,240
I'm sorry, Michael.
It's out of your hands.

445
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,879
'Let's take you live

446
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,719
'as we see the Prime Minister's car
travelling across London... '

447
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,559
He's got to do it.

448
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,640
'..Appears to be heading west
to Bankside Studios.'

449
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,919
We've ratified the law...
after midnight,

450
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,360
it'll be a criminal offence to store
any recording or images of the event.

451
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:22,119
They're doing an announcement to warn people off
even watching, some sonic tone that causes nausea.

452
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,199
'..When public opinion
has very much hardened,

"Michael Callow has displayed
incredible bravery"

458
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,520
"in what was a matter
of life or death."

459
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:51,320
That's how it opens,
then we should move on...

460
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,360
OK. Yeah.

461
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,478

00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,280
Yes, ma'am.

You'll have to see it through

We've placed visual aids in your
eyeline, which might help if you...

get into trouble.

475
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,199
The suggestion we're getting
from psychologists

476
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,320
is that you should take
as long as you need.

477
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,239
If you rush, it might be
misinterpreted as eagerness

478
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,480
or even enjoyment.

479
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,039
It's just
a skeleton crew inside.

480
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,080
Closed set.

481
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,840
There he is!

482
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,000
'I trust this will bring about the
safe return of Princess Susannah.'

483
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,240

488
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,919
But it's been on for nearly an hour.

489
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,280
It's history, this.

490
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,719
We've got her. Susannah.

491
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,640
They released her?

492
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:56,000
Stumbling about in the city.

493
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,359
Not hers. DNA shows it's male.

494
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,960
What?

495
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,919
It seems he let her go
30 minutes before it happened.

496
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,720
Why?

497
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,159
So it's a statement.

498
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,280
That's what this was all about,
making a point.

499

Should we...?

500
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:29,919
Lose that page of the report.

501

No-one sees it, especially the PM.

502
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
Of course.

503
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,759
Good news, Michael.

504
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,439
