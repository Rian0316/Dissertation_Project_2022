请前往第10法庭
please proceed to Court 10.

154
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,340
是你
You're him.

155
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,270
心水夏洛克

156
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,510
进错厕所了你
Wrong toilet.

157
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,800
- 我是你的超级粉丝  - 显而易见
- I'm a big fan.  - Evidently.

158
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,490
我读了你那些案子  一直在追
I read your cases, follow them all.

159
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,160
在我衬衫上签个名好吗
Sign my shirt, would you?

160
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,820
我的粉丝分两种
There are two types of fans.

161
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,630
有本事在下次谋杀前抓住我  这是第一种
Catch me before I kill again, Type A.

162
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,210
- 第二种呢  - 搭个出租就到我家了
- What's Type B?  - Your bedroom's just a taxi ride away.

163
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,430
你猜我是哪种
Guess which one I am?

164
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
压痕

165
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
口袋

166
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,420
墨水

167
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,370
- 都不是  - 是吗
- Neither.  - Really?

168
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,980
你根本不是粉丝
No, you're not a fan at all.

169
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,850
你前臂上的压痕  是在桌子边缘压的
Those marks on your forearm, edge of a desk.

170
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,590
你应该很匆忙地打了字
You've been typing in a hurry, probably,

171
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,870
截稿时间到了  压力巨大
pressure on, facing a deadline.

172
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,050
就这些
That all?

173
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,510
你的手腕上有墨迹
There's a smudge of ink on your wrist,

174
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,810
上衣口袋鼓起
a bulge in your left jacket pocket.

175
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,540
- 有点露馅了  - 那污点是故意弄的
- Bit of a giveaway?  - The smudge is deliberate,

176
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,790
你想看看我是不是像别人说的那么厉害
to see if I'm as good as they say I am.

177
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,310
油墨  报纸印刷用的
Oil- based, used in newspaper print.

178
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,850
不过是用食指涂抹的  你的手指
But drawn on with an index finger, your finger.

179
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,530
作为记者  你不太可能在报社沾到油墨
Journalist. Unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press.

180
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,460
你抹在那里是试探我  
You put that there to test me.

181
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,110
我开始喜欢你了
I'm liking you.

182
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,220
我替你想好标题了
you may like a great feature,

183
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,650
夏洛克・福尔摩斯  帽檐下的真相
"Sherlock Holmes, the man beneath the hat".

184
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,520
姬蒂
Kitty...

185
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,080
莱利  很高兴见到你
Riley. Pleased to meet you.

186
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,440
不  我还是帮你免了这一问吧
Nah, I'm just saving you the job of asking.

187
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,530
不  我不接受采访  
No, I won't give you an interview.

188
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,660
不  我也不需要钱
No, I don't want the money.

189
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,420
你和约翰・华生只是精神伴侣吗
You and John Watson, just platonic?

190
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,430
我能否在这个问题上也记下个不字
Can I put you down for a "No" there as well

191
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,860
新闻界有你们各种各样的绯闻
There's all sorts of gossip in the press about you.

192
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,840
迟早你会需要个和你同一战线的人
Sooner or later, you're going to need someone on your side.

193
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,040
一个帮你澄清流言的人
Someone to set the record straight.

194
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,480
你以为你能完成这种工作吗
You think you're the girl for that job, do you?

195
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,760
我很聪明  你可以信任我
I'm smart and you can trust me...

196
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,490
完全信任
totally.

197
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,770
聪明  好吧  调查型记者
Smart? OK, investigative journalist.

198
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,620
很好  看着我说出你看到什么
Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see.

199
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,960
如果你能力出众  你根本不需要采访
If you're that skilful, you don't need an interview,

200
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,580
你可以直接读到你要的一切
you can just read what you need.

201
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,650
做不到吗  还是我来吧
No? OK, my turn.

202
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,360
我看你在寻找职业生涯第一份独家新闻
I look at you and I see someone who's still waiting for their first big scoop,

203
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
以得到编辑的关注
so their editor will notice them.

204
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,120
你穿了条昂贵的短裙
You're wearing an expensive skirt,

205
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,690
还改过两次裙边  
that's been rehemmed twice.

206
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,890
这是你仅有的高档裙子
Only posh skirt you've got.

207
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,380
你的指甲  你没钱经常保养
Your nails, you can't afford to do them that often.

208
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,910
我看到了一个欲望强烈的人
I see someone who's hungry,

209
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,720
我看到的不是聪明  当然更不是可靠
I don't see smart. I definitely don't see trustworthy.

210
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,360
我给你句引语吧  五个字
I'll give you a quote. If you like. Three little words.

211
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,280
你叫我恶心
You repel me.

212
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,830
- 犯罪顾问  - 是的
- "A consulting criminal."  - Yes.

213
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,380
你能详细解释一下证词吗
Your words. Can you expand on that answer?

214
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,680
金姆斯・莫里亚蒂受人雇佣
James Moriarty is for hire.

215
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,730
- 他是个商人  - 是的
- A tradesman?  - Yes.

216
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,340
但不是帮你修暖气那种服务
But not the sort who'd fix your heating?

217
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,820
不  是帮你装炸弹或策划暗杀那种
No, the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination.

218
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,380
不过我猜让他修锅炉也能干得不错
But I'm sure he'd make a decent job of your boiler.

219
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,750
你是否会将他描述为...
Would you describe him as...

220
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,650
- 引导  - 什么
- Leading.  - What?

221
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,970
这样不行  你这是引导证人
Can't do that.  You're leading the witness.

222
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,330
他会反对  而法官会支持  
He'll object and the judge'll uphold.

223
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,510
福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes.

224
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,440
问我怎么看  问我如何描述他
Ask me how, how would I describe him?

225
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,050
我对他有怎样的看法  他们没教过你吗
What opinion have I formed of him? They don't teach you this?

226
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,650
福尔摩斯先生  没有你帮忙法庭照样转
Mr Holmes, we are fine without your help.

227
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,890
你如何描述这个人  他的性格如何
How would you describe this man, his character?

228
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,350
错误一
First mistake.

229
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,140
金姆斯・莫里亚蒂根本不是个人
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.

230
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,160
他是只蜘蛛
He's a spider.

231
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,890
网中心的蜘蛛
A spider at the centre of a web,

232
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,780
这张犯罪网中有上千条线
a criminal web with a thousand threads

233
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,900
而他对每一条的运作
and he knows precisely

234
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,890
都了如指掌
how each and every single one of them dances.

235
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,700
- 那你们认识...  - 不  别问这问题
- And how long...? - No, no. Don't, don't do that.

236
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,480
- 这问题烂透了  - 福尔摩斯先生
- That's really not a good question. - Mr Holmes!

237
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,740
我认识他多久了  问得真不怎么样
How long have I known him? Not your best line of enquiry.

238
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,070
见过两次  总共五分钟
We met twice, five minutes in total.

239
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,010
我拿枪指着他  他想炸死我
I pulled a gun, he tried to blow me up.

240
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,240
好像我俩挺来电
I felt we had a special something.

241
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,590
索雷尔律师  你真觉得这人是个专家么
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert?

242
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,780
他和被告就见过五分钟
After knowing the accused for just five minutes?

243
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,930
两分钟我就能看透一个人  五分钟够充裕了
Two minutes would have made me an expert, five was ample.

244
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,620
- 福尔摩斯先生  那由陪审团决定  - 是嘛
- Mr Holmes, that's a matter for the jury. - Really?

245
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
商人

246
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
老师

247
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
有外遇

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
老师

249
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
已婚

250
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
图书管理员

251
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,520
一个图书管理员  两个老师
One librarian, two teachers,

252
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,170
两人工作压力很大  应该是金融人士
two high- pressure jobs, probably the City.

253
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,830
陪审团主席是医疗秘书  外国受训
The foreman's a medical secretary, trained abroad,

254
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,470
- 因为她的速记  - 福尔摩斯先生
- judging by her shorthand. - Mr Holmes?

255
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,910
七个已婚  两个在和对方搞外遇
Seven are married, two are having an affair with each other.

256
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,500
他们刚用完下午茶
They've just had tea and biscuits.

257
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,420
你想知道谁吃了威化饼么
Would you like to know who ate the wafer?

258
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,960
福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes!

259
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,010
传唤你来是为了回答索雷尔律师的问题
You've been called here to answer Miss Sorrel's questions,

260
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,080
不是让你来展示自己有多聪明
not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess.

261
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,520
请言简意赅地回答问题
Keep your answers brief and to the point.

262
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,020
否则就算你蔑视法庭
Anything else will be treated as contempt.

263
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,330
少显摆一会你能死么
Do you think you could survive for just a few minutes with out showing off!

264
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,600
我说什么来着  让你别耍小聪明
What did I say? I said don't get clever.

265
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
我又不是水龙头说关就关
I can't just turn it on and off like a tap.

266
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,670
- 如何  - 什么如何
- Well? - Well, what?

267
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,970
你不是一直在么
You were there for the whole thing,

268
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,840
从头到尾都在旁听
up in the gallery, start to finish.

269
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,520
跟你说的一样
Like you said it would be...

270
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,000
他靠着椅背  一直很淡定
sat on his backside, never even stirred.

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,790
莫里亚蒂根本不打算为自己辩护
Moriarty is not mounting any defence.

272
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,120
英格兰银行  伦敦塔  本顿维尔监狱
Bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville.

273
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,920
全国最安全的三个地方
Three of the most secure places in the country

274
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,980
六周以前  莫里亚蒂成功闯入
and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in,

275
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,080
没人知道手法  或者原因
no- one knows how or why.

276
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,240
- 我们只知道...  - 他被拘留了
- All we know is... - He ended up in custody.

277
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,320
- 别这样  - 哪样
- Don't do that. - Do what?

278
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,640
- 那表情  - 啥  - 你又露出那表情了
- The look. - Look? - You're doing the look again.

279
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
我自己又看不见
Well, I can't see it, can I?

280
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,120
我的脸啊
It's my face.

281
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,640
对  而且你露出了一种
Yes and it's doing a thing, you are doing

282
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,270
"我们都知道到底怎么回事"的表情
"We both know what's really going on here" face.

283
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,870
- 确实嘛  - 我就不知道  所以我才讨厌你那表情
- We do. - No, I don't, which is why I find the face so annoying.

284
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,400
如果莫里亚蒂想要王冠  他可以直接拿走
If Moriarty wanted the jewels, he'd have them.

285
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,350
他想放走犯人  他们早就出狱了
If he wanted the prisoners freed, they'd be out on the streets.

286
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,120
他之所以现在还在监狱里
The only reason he's still in a prison cell right now

287
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,280
是因为他想要被关起来
is because he chose to be there.

288
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,180
这是他计划的一部分
Somehow this is part of his scheme.

289
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,940
克雷西尔律师  请把第一位证人传上法庭
Mr Crayhill, can we have your first witness?

290
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,410
法官大人  我们没有证人
Your Honour, we're not calling any witnesses.

291
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,500
我不懂
I don't follow.

292
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,780
你们不是辩方么
You've entered a plea of not guilty.

293
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,080
可我的当事人并未提供任何证据
Nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence.

294
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,820
被告陈述完毕
The defence... rests.

295
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,050
陪审团的各位
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

296
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,430
金姆斯・莫里亚蒂被控告
James Moriarty stands accused...

297
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,430
和多起盗窃未遂案有关
of several counts of attempted burglary.

298

299
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,720
将被监禁多年
will elicit a very long custodial sentence,

300
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,020
可是  他的法律团队
and yet... his legal team...

301
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,030
却不提供任何证据
has chosen to offer no evidence

302
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,590
来为他进行辩护
whatsoever to support their plea.

303
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,600
这不寻常  但出于公正
I find myself in the unusual position

304
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,260
我给陪审团一个裁决建议
of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly.

305
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,160
你们必须判他有罪
You must find him guilty.

有罪
Guilty.

307
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,960
你们必须判他有罪
You must find him guilty.

308

开庭了
They're coming back.

309

才六分钟
That's six minutes.

310
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,420
说实话居然用了这么久
Surprised it took them that long, to be honest.

311
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,060
厕所排队的人真多
There's a queue for the loo!

312
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,860
请陪审团宣布你们一致通过的裁决
Have you reached a verdict on which you all agree?

313
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,380
罪名不成立  他们居然判他无罪
Not guilty, they found him not guilty.

314
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,680
没有辩护  莫里亚蒂无罪释放
No defence and Moriarty's walked free.

315
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,140
夏洛克
Sherlock?

316
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,780
你在听吗  他出来了
Are you listening? He's out,

317
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,970
你知道他会找上你  夏...
you know he'll be coming after you. Sherl...

318
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,850
一般人会先敲门
Most people knock.

319
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,770
不过我想你也不是一般人
But then, you're not most people, I suppose.

320
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,710
水正好开了
Kettle's just boiled.

321
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,080
巴赫都都会震惊的
Johann Sebastian would be appalled.

322
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,960
- 能坐吗  - 请
- May I? - Please.

323
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,950
你知道吗  巴赫临死之前
You know when he was on his deathbed, Bach,

324
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,530
听见自己儿子在弹奏他的作品
he heard his son at the piano playing one of his... pieces.

325
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,380
还没弹完男孩就不弹了
The boy stopped before he got to the end.

326
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,870
那个弥留之人就跳下床
The dying man jumped out of bed,

327
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,480
跑到钢琴边弹完了整首曲子
ran to the piano and finished it.

328
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,350
无法忍受未完成的乐章
Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody.

329
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,760
你也是  所以你才过来
Neither can you, that's why you've come.

330
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,310
实话说  你有那么点开心
Be honest, you're a tiny bit pleased.

331
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,360
什么  审判结果么
What, with the verdict?

332
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,860
我又回来兴风作浪了
With me, back on the streets.

333
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,250
每个童话故事都要有个老派的坏蛋
Every fairy tale needs a good old- fashioned villain.

334
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,070
你需要我  否则你屁都不是
You need me or you're nothing.

335
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,940
因为我们本来就很像
Because we're just alike, you and I,

336
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,540
只是你比我无聊
except you're boring.

337
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,650
你站在正义那一方
You're on the side of the angels.

338
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,860
当然  你控制了陪审团
You got to the jury, of course.

339
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,350
我都能闯入伦敦塔
I got into the Tower of London,

340
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,290
12间酒店房间又算什么
you think I can't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms?

341
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,370
有线网
Cable network.

342
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,100
每个房间都有私人电视屏幕
Every hotel bedroom has a personalised TV screen.

343
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,130
每个人都有自己的弱点
And every person has their pressure point.

344
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,130
如果你想让你可爱的孩子们安然无恙
就照我说的做

345
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,520
都有自己想保护的人
Someone that they want to protect from harm.

346
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,300
小菜一碟
Easy peasy.

347
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,270
你打算怎么做
So how are you going to do it?

348

毁了我
Burn me?

349
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,220
就是这谜题  最后的谜题
That's the problem, the final problem.

350
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,320

Have you worked out what it is yet?

351
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,020
最后一案到底是什么
What's the final problem?

352
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,290
我告诉过你  不过你仔细听了吗
I did tell you... but did you listen?

353
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,150
对你来说  说句"我不知道"有多困难
How hard do you find it, having to say "I don't know"?

354
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,970
- 我不知道  - 很聪明啊  真聪明
- I don't know. - That's clever, very clever, awfully clever.

355
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,310
说起聪明  你跟你那些小朋友说了吗
Speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet?

356
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,090
说什么
Told them what?

357
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,480
- 为何我闯入那些地方却空手而回  - 没有
- Why I broke into all those places and never took anything? - No.

358
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,310
- 但你明白  - 当然

359
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,130
那请说吧
Off you go, then.

360
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,630
你自己也知道  我还说什么
You want me to tell you what you already know?

361
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,560
不  我要你证明你知道
No, I want you to prove that you know it.

362
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,110
- 什么都不拿是因为你不需要  - 好

你再也不用拿任何东西了
You'll never need to take anything ever again.

364
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,660
很好  因为什么

00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,750
因为英格兰银行  伦敦塔和本顿维尔监狱

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,570
里面没有东西能比上你手里那个

任何地方的任何门我都打得开
I can open any door anywhere

369
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,700
只要几行计算机代码就行

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,800
什么私人银行账户都是胡扯  全属于我

亲爱的  你真该看看我戴王冠的样子
And honey, you should see me in a crown.

376
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,470
你是利用审讯宣传自己
You were advertising all through the trial,

377
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,620
给世人展现你的能耐
you were showing the world what you can do.

378
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,900
你也帮了我
And you were helping.

恐怖组织

转眼我就成了万人迷
Suddenly, I'm Mr Sex.

383
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,650
如果你能进入任何银行
If you can break any bank,

384
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,700
你还在乎什么最高价竞买人
what do you care about the highest bidder?

385
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,940
我不在乎  我就是爱看他们抢破头的样
I don't, I just like to watch them all competing.

386
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,810
"爸爸最爱的是我"  凡人真可爱

就要开始了  夏洛克  坠落
It's going to start very soon, Sherlock... the fall.

396
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,320
fall[坠落]同有瀑布之意  在这里双关

397
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,110
不过别怕  坠落跟飞翔一样
But don't be scared, falling is just like flying,

398
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,600

401
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,380
因为我欠你一次坠落  夏洛克
Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.

402
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,710
我  欠  你

417
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,990
你听不见我说话吗
Can you not hear me?

418
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,570

422
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,460
我是透明的吗  你们看得见我么
Am I invisible, can you actually see me?

423

多谢两位  有人叫我来找麦考夫・福尔摩斯
Thanks, gents. I've been asked to meet Mycroft Holmes.

424
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,320

What the hell?!

425
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,840
传统嘛  约翰  传统界定了我们
Tradition, John, our traditions define us.

426
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,000
不准讲话算哪门子传统
So total silence is traditional, is it?

427
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,420
连句"把糖递给我"都不能说吗

- 不认识  - 没见过他

448
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,610
那地段很好  坐地铁很方便
Well, it's a great location. Jubilee line's handy.

449
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,930
- 约翰  - 这跟我有什么关系
- John... - What's it got to do with me?

450
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,480
德琴科・卢德米拉
Dyachenko Ludmila.

451
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,110
- 我好像见过她  - 俄国杀手
- Actually, I think I have seen her. - Russian killer.

452
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,920
住你家对面
She's taken the flat opposite.

453
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,770
好吧
Ok.

454
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,950
我有点明白你的意思了
I'm sensing a pattern here.

455
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,620
其实  四个国际顶级刺客都搬到了
In fact, four top international assassins relocate

456
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,660
221B附近
to within spitting distance of 221b.

457
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,520
有什么想告诉我的么
Anything you'd care to share with me?

458
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,710
我该搬家了吗
I'm moving?

459
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,680
不难猜到他们的共同之处
It's not hard to guess the common denominator, is it?

460
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,190
你觉得是莫里亚蒂安排的吗
You think this is Moriarty?

461
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,710
他跟夏洛克说他一定会回来
He promised Sherlock he'd come back.

462
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,520
如果这是莫里亚蒂的杰作  我们早就死了
If this was Moriarty, we'd be dead already.

463
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,810
如果不是莫里亚蒂  那又是谁
If not Moriarty, then who?

464
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,930
你既然这么担心他  怎么不去找夏洛克谈谈
Why don't you talk to Sherlock, if you're so concerned about him?

465
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,790
天呐  别说了
God, don't tell me.

466
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,360
我们之间有太多事  约翰
Too much history between us, John.

467
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,410
旧账  愤恨
Old scores, resentments.

468
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,380
偷走了他的蓝精灵  还是弄坏了他的机动战士
Nicked all his Smurfs? Broke his Action Man?

469
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,040
看完了
Finished.

470
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,060
我们都知道要发生什么  约翰
We both know what's coming, John.

471
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,350
莫里亚蒂不会罢休  他发誓要干掉他唯一的敌手
Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn to destroy his only rival.

472
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,080
所以你要我去照看你弟弟
So you want me to watch out for your brother

473
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,150
就因为他不会接受你的帮助
because he won't accept your help?

474
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,720
希望不会太麻烦你
If it's not too much trouble?

475
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,260
- 借过  - 抱歉
- Excuse me. - Sorry.

476
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,170
夏洛克  有件怪事...
Sherlock, something weird...

477
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,310
怎么回事
What's going on?

478
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,340
- 绑架案  - 驻美大使路法斯・布卢尔
- Kidnapping. - Rufus Bruhl. The ambassador to the US.

479
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,440
他不是在华盛顿吗
He's in Washington, isn't he?

480
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,630
不是他  是他的孩子
Not him, his children.

481
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,770
麦斯和克劳黛  一个七岁  一个九岁
Max and Claudette, age seven and nine.

482
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,440
- 他们在圣艾尔代茨  - 萨里郡的豪华寄宿学校
- They're at St Aldates. - Posh boarding place in Surrey.

483
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,640
学校放假  其他寄宿生都回家了
School broke up, all the boarders went home.

484
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,490
只有几个孩子留校  就包括他俩
Just a few kids remained, including those two.

485
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,670
两个孩子不见了
The kids have vanished.

486
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,510
大使亲自指名找你
The ambassador's asked for you personally.

487
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,670
莱辛巴赫英雄
The Reichenbach hero.

488
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,650
跟名人一起办案真不错啊
Isn't it great to be working with a celebrity?

489
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,470
应该很快就能放你走了  谢谢
We shouldn't need to keep you for much longer. Thank you.

490
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,120
- 没事了  - 麦肯齐小姐是舍监  温柔点
- It's all right. - Miss MacKenzie, House Mistress. Go easy.

491
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,790
麦肯齐小姐  你负责学生的安全
Miss MacKenzie, you're in charge of pupil welfare,

492
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,540
可昨晚却有人轻易闯入
yet you left this place wide open last night.

493
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,360
你是白痴  喝醉了  还是同伙
What are you, an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?!

494
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560
立刻  迅速  回答我
Now, quickly, tell me!

495
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,880
门窗都关好了
All the doors and the windows were properly bolted.

496
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,150
昨晚没有任何人  包括我都没进过他们的房间
No- one, not even me, went into their room last night.

497
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,580
你得相信我
You have to believe me!

498
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,260
我相信  我就是想让你快点说
I do, I just wanted you to speak quickly.

499
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,420
麦肯齐小姐需要个口袋呼吸
Miss MacKenzie will need to breath into a bag now.

500
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,650
每学期六千块
Six grand a term,

501
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,750
居然还不能保证孩子的安全
you'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you.

502
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,690
你说其他的孩子都放假走了
You said the other kids had all left on their holidays.

503
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,810
只有他们俩还住在这层楼上
They were the only two sleeping on this floor.

504
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,820
完全没有强行闯入的迹象
There's absolutely no sign of a break- in.

505
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,550
闯入者肯定是藏在什么地方了
The intruder must have been hidden inside some place.

506
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,630
格林童话

507
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,880
带我去哥哥的房间
Show me where the brother slept.

508
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,520
小男孩每晚都睡在这儿
The boy sleeps there every night.

509
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,300
盯着从走廊投进来的唯一光线
Gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor.

510
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,910
他会认出每个人的形态和轮廓
He'd recognise every shape, every outline,

511
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,090
每一个走到门前的人的剪影
the silhouette of everyone who came to the door.

512
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,620
那又如何
OK, so?

513
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,740
那样  如果有一个他没见过的人走到门前
So if someone approaches the door who he doesn't recognise,

514
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,100
就知道是闯入者  或许他都能看到武器的轮廓
an intruder, maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon.

515
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,780
他会怎么做
What would he do?

516
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,760
在他们闯进来之前珍贵的几秒钟内
In the precious few seconds before they came into the room,

517
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,410
他如果没有大声呼救  会怎么做
how would he use them if not to cry out?

518
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,950
这个小男孩  就是这个小男孩
This little boy, this particular little boy,

519
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,190
他读了那么多间谍小说  他会怎么做
who reads all of those spy books, what would he do?

520
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,490
留下什么标记吗
He'd leave a sign?

521
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,290
叫安德森来
Get Anderson!

522
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,310
帮帮我们

523
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,810
亚麻油
Linseed oil.

524
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,470
没什么用  不能帮我们找到绑匪
Not much use, it doesn't lead us to the kidnapper.

525
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,080
很不错  安德森
Brilliant, Anderson.

526
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,250
- 是吗  - 是啊  很不错地展现了白痴的风范
- Really? - Yes, brilliant impression of an idiot.

527
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,970
看地板
Floor.

528
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,720
他为我们留下了足迹
He... made a trail for us.

529
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,190
男孩被逼着走在他们前面
The boy was made to walk ahead of them.

530
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,430
怎么  因为踮脚了吗  
On what, tiptoe?

531
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,560
不安的表现
Indicates anxiety.

532
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,410
有人拿枪指着他的脑袋
Gun held to his head.

533
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,610
女孩被人拉着侧身走在他旁边
The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways.

534
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,190
他的胳膊架在她的脖子上
He had his left arm cradled about her neck.

535
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,820
就到这了  我们不知道他们接下来去哪了
That's the end of it, we don't know where they went from here.

536
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,360
到底还是没什么用
Tells us nothing after all.

537
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,520
说得对  安德森  是没什么用
You're right, Anderson, nothing.

538
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,820
只让我们知道他的鞋码  身高  步法和步速
Except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace.

539
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,870
玩得开心吗
Having fun?

540
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,750
现在开心了
Starting to.

541
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,390
或许还是别笑的好  毕竟有小孩被绑了
Maybe don't do the smiling. Kidnapped children?

542
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,810
如果门都锁上了  他怎么躲过的监视器
How could he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked.

543
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,840
他门没锁的时候就进来了
He walked in when they weren't locked.

544
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,120
但那种学校哪会让陌生人随意进出
But a stranger can't just walk into a school like that.

545
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,130
只要时机对  任何人都能随意进出任何地方
Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment.

546
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,780
昨天是期末
Yesterday, end of term,

547
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,280
到处是家长  司机  员工
parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff.

548
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,410
他们中间再混进个陌生人谁会察觉
What's one more stranger among that lot?

549
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,920
他伺机行事
He was waiting for them.

550
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,300
只要找个好地方藏身即可
All he had to do was find a place to hide.

551
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,790
圣巴塞洛缪医院

552
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,740
茉莉
Molly!

553
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,760
你好啊  我正要出去
Hello, I'm just going out.

554
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,220
- 不  你不出去  - 我午饭约了人
- No, you're not. - I've got a lunch date.

555
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,320
- 取消吧  我们一起吃午餐  - 啥
- Cancel it, you're having lunch with me. - What?

556
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,300
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

557
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,210
事关你的一个前男友  我们正在追查他的下落
It's one of your old boyfriends, we're trying to track him down.

558
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,400
他近来有些捣蛋
He's been a bit naughty.

559
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,430
- 是莫里亚蒂干的吗  - 当然是他
- It's Moriarty? - Of course it's Moriarty!

560
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,950
其实金算不上是我男朋友
Jim actually wasn't even my boyfriend,

561
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,860
我们只约会过三次  我没再和他交往了
we went out three times. I ended it.

562
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,050
是啊  然后他去偷走了王冠和权杖
Yes, then he stole the Crown Jewels,

563
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,980
闯进英国央行
broke into the Bank of England

564
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,520
还组织了本顿维尔监狱的越狱
and organised a prison break in Pentonville.

565
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,920
为了维护法纪和秩序  我建议你
For the sake of law and order, I suggest you

566
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,350
将来就不要找男朋友了  茉莉
avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly.

567
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,710
那些油渍  约翰  绑匪脚印里的油渍
Oil, John. The oil in the kidnapper's footprint.

568
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,340
会帮我们找到莫里亚蒂
It'll lead us to Moriarty.

569
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,150
他鞋上所有的化学品都保存了下来
All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved.

570
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,380
鞋底就好像护照
The sole of the shoe is like a passport.

571
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,800
如果我们走运  能查到他最近的全部行踪
If we're lucky, we'll see everything he's been up to.

572
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,430
那个需要做分析
I need that analysis.

573
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,370
是碱性的
Alkaline.

574
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,050
- 谢谢你  约翰  - 是茉莉
- Thank you, John. - Molly.

575
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,100
是啊
Yes.

576

白垩

577
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,950
沥青

578
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,400
砖尘

579
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,550
植物

580
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,360
我欠你的
I... o... u.

581
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,070
甘油分子

582

583
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,290
是什么东西
What are you?

584
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,300
你说"我欠你的"是什么意思
What did you mean, IOU?

585
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,740
你刚刚说"我欠你的"
You said IOU.

586
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,970
你刚刚一直在念叨这几个字
You were muttering it while you were working.

587
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,420
没什么  记下来的东西罢了
Nothing, mental note.

588
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,450
你有点像我爸  他死了  哦不  抱歉
You're a bit like my dad. He's dead. No, sorry.

589
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,200
茉莉  请不要觉得非得跟我搭讪
Molly, please don't feel the need to make conversation,

590
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,950
这真不是你的强项
it's really not your area.

591
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:56,850
他死前那段日子  总是很开心  心情愉悦
When he was dying, he was always cheerful, he was lovely,

592
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,780
可他以为没人看到他时就不是这样了
except when he thought no- one could see.

593
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,340
- 我有次看到他的样子  很哀伤  - 茉莉
- I saw him once, he looked sad. - Molly.

594
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,630
你就很哀伤  当你以为他看不到你的时候
You look sad, when you think he can't see you.

595
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,640
你没事吧  别说你没事
Are you OK? And don't just say you are,

596
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,040
因为我知道那种表情的含义
because I know what that means,

597
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,530
以为没人看着你时就流露哀伤的含义
looking sad when you think no- one can see you.

598
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,420
- 你就能看见我  - 我对你不算数
- You can see me. - I don't count.

599
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,150
我只是想说  如果我能做什么
What I'm trying to say is, that if there's anything I can do,

600
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,400
你需要我做任何事  我都会帮你
anything you need, anything at all, you can have me.

601
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,080
不是  我就是说  我是说
No, I just mean, I mean,

602
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,190
如果你需要我做什么事  我都可以
if there's anything you need, it's fine.

603
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,290
但我会需要你做什么
But what can I need from you?

604
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,030
没什么  我不知道
Nothing. I don't know.

605
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,270
其实你大可只说句谢谢
You could probably say thank you, actually.

606
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,690
那谢谢了
Thank you?

607
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,560
我要去买点薯片吃
I'm just going to go and get some crisps.

608
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,960
你想吃什么吗
Do you want anything?

609
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,650
算了  我知道你不吃
It's OK, I know you don't.

610
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,560
- 其实  要不我...  - 我知道你不吃

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,880
- 还有一个  - 什么
- there's another one. - What?

614
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:24,000
今天有人放在我们门阶上  没错  你瞧啊
On our doorstep. Found it today. Yes, and look at that.

615
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,380
你瞧  是完全相同的封印
Look at that, exactly the same seal.

616
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,340
- 面包屑  - 我回来的时候就放在那儿
- Breadcrumbs. - It was there when I got back.

617
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,140
面包屑留下的行迹
A little trace of breadcrumbs.

618
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,270

625
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,120
喜欢自吹自擂的绑匪
The sort that likes to boast,

626
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,540
他把这一切看作是个游戏
the sort that thinks it's all a game.

627
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,990
他坐在我们的公寓里  对我说的原话是
He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me...

628
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,140
每个童话故事都要有个老派的坏蛋
"All fairy tales need a good old- fashioned villain."

629
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,770
第五样物质  是童话的一部分

是聚甘油蓖麻醇酯
PGPR!

634
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,930
- 那是什么  - 是用来做巧克力的

635
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,040
这是一小时前传真过来的
This fax arrived an hour ago.

636
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,760

00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,870
我认为我们要找的是一间废弃的糖果厂
I think we're looking for a disused sweet factory.

643
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,010
我们得缩小范围  有沥青的糖果厂呢
We need to narrow that down. A sweet factory with asphalt?

644
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,300
不行  还是太泛泛  得有更具体的东西
No, no, no, no, too general. Something more specific.

645
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,300
白垩  白垩质粘土  这样能缩小地理范围
Chalk, chalky clay. That's a far thinner band of geology.

between the river and the park, it matches everything.

658
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,030
好吧  行动  行动
Right, come on. Come on!

659
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,890
好了  你们去那边看
OK, you look over there.

660
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,390
不要有疏漏
Look everywhere.

661
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,350
大家请散开  散开
OK, spread out, please, spread out.

662
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,370
刚刚熄灭的  他们还在这儿
This was alight moments ago. They're still here!

663
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,080

- 水银  - 什么

666
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,460
糖纸  上面涂了水银  是有毒的
The papers, they're painted with mercury, lethal.

667
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,570
他们吃得越多
The more they ate...

668
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,380
就会要了他们的命
It was killing them.

669
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,240
但是单个不足以致命
But it's not enough to kill them on its own.

670
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,760
如果摄入足够多的量  最终会导致他们死亡
Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them.

671
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,340
他不需要亲自来行刑
He didn't need to be there for the execution.

672
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,920
遥控杀人  他可以待在千里之外
Murder by remote control, he could be 1,000 miles away.

673
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,800
他们越饿  吃得越多
The hungrier they got, the more they ate,

674
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,560
就死得越快  真漂亮
the faster they died. Neat.

675
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,890
- 控制一下  - 在这边
- Sherlock. - Over here!

676
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,200
我会照顾他  别担心
I've got him, don't worry.

677
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,400
好了  专业人士都问完了
Right then, the professionals are finished.

678
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,060
要是外行还想进去自己问问
If the amateurs want to go in and have their turn.

679
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,650
记住  她受了惊吓  而且只有七岁
Now remember, she's in shock and she's just seven years old,

680
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,900
所以  如果你能...
so, anything you can do to...

681
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,000
- 别太夏洛克吗  - 对  可能会比较好
- Not be myself? - Yeah, might be helpful.

682
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,700
克劳黛  我
Claudette, I...

683
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,760
别这样  我知道你很害怕
No, no, I know it's been hard for you.

684
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,090
- 克劳黛  听着  - 出去  出去
- Claudette, listen to me. - Out. Get out!

685
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,480
- 这没道理啊  - 孩子受惊过度
- Makes no sense. - Kid's traumatised.

686
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,140
夏洛克某些地方让她想起那个绑匪
Something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper.

687
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,320
她说什么了吗
What's she said?

688
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,190
一个字都没说
Hasn't uttered another syllable.

689
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,040
- 那个男孩呢  - 还是昏迷不醒
- And the boy? - No, he's unconscious.

690
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,630
仍在重症监护中
He's still in intensive care.

691
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,430
别往心里去
Well, don't let it get to you,

692
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,930
每次看你进门  我都想尖叫
I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room.

693
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,870
说实话很多人都有同感
In fact, so do most people.

694
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,580
走吧
Come on.

695
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,810
只凭脚印你就找到了那些孩子  了不起
Brilliant work you did finding those kids from just a footprint,

696
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,140
真是太神奇了
it's really amazing.

697
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,940
谢谢
Thank you.

698
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,180
难以置信
Unbelievable.

699
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,020
- 你还好吗  - 在思考
- You OK? - Thinking.

700
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,890
我坐这辆  你等下辆吧
This is my cab, you get the next one.

701
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,710
- 为什么  - 你会说话
- Why? - You might talk.

702
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,560
"这是巧克力吗"
'Is this chocolate?'

703
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,730
"我们要找的是一家废弃的糖果厂"
'We're looking for a disused sweet factory.'

704
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,030
"出去"
'Get out!'

705
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,650
有问题吗
Problem?

710
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,220
把这关掉行不行
Can you turn this off?!

711
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,520
搭配四条镶嵌式钻石手链
Accompanied by four spangly diamond bracelets...

712
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,400
你好
Hello.

713
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,400
准备好听故事了吗
Are you ready for the story?

714
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,080
这是自夸骑士的故事
This is the story of Sir Boast- a- lot.

715
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,930
一个脚印  这就是他所有的线索
A footprint, it's all he had.

716
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,250
一个脚印
A footprint.

717
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,840
是啊  你也知道他的能耐
Yeah, well, you know what he's like.

718
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,860
贝克街犯罪现场调查专家
CSI Baker Street.

719
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,250
可我们的人就做不到
Well, our boys couldn't have done it.

720
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,390
所以我们需要他  他更厉害
Well, that's why we need him, he's better.

721
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,070
这只是一种解释
That's one explanation.

722
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,530
还有别的解释吗
And what's the other?

723
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,200
自夸骑士是圆桌骑士中
Sir Boast- a- lot was the bravest

724
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,860
最勇敢  也是最聪明的骑士
and cleverest knight at the round table.

725
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,280
但其他骑士逐渐开始厌倦他那些
But soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories

726
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,860
讲述他多么英勇
about how brave he was

727
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,060
颂扬他屠龙伟业的故事
and how many dragons he'd slain.

728
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,890
很快他们就开始怀疑
And soon they began to wonder,

729
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,630
自夸爵士的故事究竟是不是真的
"Are Sir Boast- a- lot's stories even true?"

730
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,160
只有他能找到那些证据
Only he could have found that evidence.

731
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,830
不  不
No. No

732
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:19,310
那女孩看到他时  叫得撕心裂肺
The girl screams her head off when she sees him...

733
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,270
她可从来没见过他
A man she has never seen before,

734
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,720
除非她以前见过他
unless she had seen him before.

735
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,560
你究竟想说什么
What's your point?

736
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:26,040
你知道我想说什么  你只是不想相信
You know what it is, you just don't want to think about it.

737
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,530
于是所有的骑士都去对亚瑟王说
So, all of the knights went to King Arthur and said,

738
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,840
"我不相信自夸骑士的故事"
'I don't believe Sir Boast- a- lot's stories.'

739
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,030
"他就是个大骗子"
'He's just a big old liar'

740
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,610
"都是他编的故事  让自己显得很了不起"
'who makes things up to make himself look good.

741
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,060
你们不会真以为是他干的吧
You're not seriously suggesting he's involved, are you?

742
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,600
我认为我们得考虑这种可能性
I think we have to entertain the possibility.

743
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,700
后来  甚至连国王也开始怀疑
And then, even the King began to wonder.

744
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,800
但自夸骑士的最终问题还不是这个
But that wasn't the end of Sir Boast- a- lot's problem.

745
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,130
不
No.

746
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,900
这还不是他的最终问题
That wasn't the final problem.

747
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,930
故事讲完了
The end.

748
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,410
停车
Stop the cab.

749
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,040
停车
Stop the cab!

750
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,330
那是怎么回事
What was that?!

751
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,900
那是什么
What was that?

752
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,060
不要钱了
No charge.

753
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,370
小心
Watch out!

754
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,410
谢谢
Thank you.

755
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,230
夏洛克
Sherlock!

756
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,960
是他  是那个人
That is him. It's him.

757
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,450
叫苏莱曼尼什么的
Sulejmani or something,

758
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,990
麦考夫给我看过他的档案
Mycroft showed me his file.

759
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,450
他是阿尔巴尼亚的黑帮大佬
He's a big Albanian gangster,

760
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,600
住的地方跟我们只隔两户
lives two doors down from us.

761
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,410
- 他因为跟我握手而被杀  - 什么意思
- He died because I shook his hand. - What do you mean?

762
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,750
他救了我的命  却不能碰我  为什么
He saved my life, but he couldn't touch me. Why?

763
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,920
我们家门口就住着四个杀手
Four assassins living right on our doorstep.

764
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,380
他们不是来杀我的
They haven't come here to kill me.

765
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,510
他们必须保住我的命
They have to keep me alive.

766
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,570
我手上有他们都想要的东西
I've got something that all of them want.

767
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,710
但如果他们中任何一个接近我
But if one of them approaches me,

768
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,240
其他人就会杀死他
The others kill them before they can get it.

769
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,650
选择您要使用的网络

770
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,650
从以下列表中选择您要使用的网络 必要时请输入网络密码

771
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,590
所有注意力都在我身上
All of the attention is focused on me.

772
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,370
一张严密的监控网正监视着我们
There's a surveillance web closing in on us right now.

773
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,400
你手上究竟有什么东西这么重要
So what have you got that's so important?

774
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,220
我得问问除尘的状况
I need to ask about the dusting.

775
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,570
要精确的细节  上个星期哪里被清扫过
Precise details, in the last week, what's been cleaned?

776
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,170
星期二  我清理了你的地毯
Tuesday, I did your lino.

777
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,960
不  是这里  我们要在这个房间找
No, in here, this room, this is where we'll find it.

778
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,300
任何灰尘被擦拭的痕迹
Any break in the dust line.

779
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,220
什么都能归位  但灰尘不行
You can put back anything but dust.

780
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,400
灰尘即铁证
Dust is eloquent.

781
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,930
他这是要做什么
What is it all about?

782
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,160
找摄像头  我们被监视了
Cameras, we're being watched.

783
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:01,080
什么  摄像头  在这儿吗
What?! Cameras? Here?

784
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,560
我穿着睡衣呢
I'm in my nightie!

785
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,370
- 不  探长  - 怎么了
- No, Inspector. - Why?

786
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,630
- 我的回答是不  - 我什么都没问呢
- The answer's no. - You've not heard the question!

787
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,990
你想把我带到警署去
You want to take me to the station.

788
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,490
就不麻烦你开口问了
Just saving you the trouble of asking.

789
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:30,210
夏洛克
Sherlock.

790
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,260
- 因为那声尖叫  - 是的
- The scream? - Yeah.

791
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,240
是谁说的  多诺万  肯定是多诺万
Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan.

792
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,980
我是否与绑架案有牵连
"Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping?"

793
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,820
莫里亚蒂很聪明
Moriarty is smart.

794
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,060
他在她脑海里植入怀疑的种子
He planted that doubt in her head.

795
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,510
那种感觉萦绕不去
That little nagging sensation.

796
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,420
很难抗拒
You're going to have to be strong to resist.

797
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,910
你没法扼杀一种想法  对吧
You can't kill an idea, can you?

798
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,610
只要它在这里  生根发芽
Not once it's made a home... there.

799
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,140
你会跟我走吗
Will you come?

800
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,170
他的下一步棋  是一张照片
One photograph, that's his next move.

801
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,190
莫里亚蒂的游戏
Moriarty's game.

802
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,100
先是孩子的尖叫
First the scream,

803
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,190
然后是我被带去问讯的照片
then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning.

804
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,300
他想一点一点地毁了我
He wants to destroy me inch by inch.

805
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,710
这是一场游戏  雷斯垂德
It is a game, Lestrade,

806
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,250
而我并不想参与
and not one I'm willing to play.

807
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,090
代我向多诺万警佐问好
Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.

808
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,240
- 他们会作出决定  - 什么决定
- They'll be deciding. - Deciding?

809
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,960
是否带着逮捕令回来逮捕我
Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me.

810
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,890
你这么觉得吗
You think?

811
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,000
这是标准程序
Standard procedure.

812
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,480
你应该跟他走  别人会以为...
You should have gone with him. People'll think...

813
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,400
我才不在乎别人怎么想
I don't care what people think.

814
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,080
但你不想让他们认为你很蠢  或犯了错
You'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong.

815
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,680
不  是他们蠢  他们犯了错
No, that would just make them stupid or wrong.

816
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,950
夏洛克  我不想让这个世界以为你是...
Sherlock, I don't want the world believing you're...

817
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,020
以为我是什么
That I am what?

818
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,290
骗子
A fraud.

819
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,120
- 你担心他们是对的  - 什么
- You're worried they're right. - What?

820
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,510
- 你担心他们对我的判断是对的  - 不
- That they're right about me. - No.

821
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,460
这就是你烦躁的原因
That's why you're upset.

822
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,610
你不能不考虑  他们或许是对的
You can't entertain the possibility they may be right.

823
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,210
- 你害怕自己也受了骗  - 我没有
- You're afraid you've been taken in as well. - No, no.

824
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,050
莫里亚蒂也在玩弄你的思想
Moriarty is playing with your mind, too.

825
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,970
你难道看不出是怎么回事吗
Can't you SEE what's going on?!

826
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,150
不  我认识的是真实的你
No, I know you for real.

827
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,010
百分之百吗
100 percent?

828
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,250
谁会一直假装成这么个讨厌鬼
Well, nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time.

829
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,510
- 夏洛克・福尔摩斯  - 是的  长官
- Sherlock Holmes? - Yes, sir.

830
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,630
媒体上经常报道的那个家伙
That bloke that's been in the press?

831
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,990
我以为他是个私家侦探
I thought he was some sort of private eye.

832
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,790
- 他是的  - 我们一直都在向他咨询
- He is. - We've been consulting with him,

833
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,510
你是这个意思吗
that's what you're telling me?

834
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:57,350
我们没有让他插手过机要案件吧
Not used him on any proper cases though, have we?

835
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,650
有那么一两个吧
Well, one or two.

836
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,520
或许是二三十个
Or 20 or 30.

837
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:01,230
什么
What?!

838
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,880
不是只有我这么做  格雷格森...
I'm not the only senior officer who did this. Gregson...

839
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,410
闭嘴
Shut up!

840
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,660
一个业余侦探
An amateur detective

841
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,280
居然能接触到各种机密信息
given access to all sorts of classified information.

842
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,330
现在他还是一个案件的疑犯
And now he's a suspect in a case.

843
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,400
- 恕我直言  - 你这个白痴  雷斯垂德
- With all due respect... - You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade!

844
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,700
现在就去把他抓来  就现在
Now go and fetch him in, right now.

845
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,420
去抓他
Do it!

846
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,560
现在你们得意了
Proud of yourselves?

847
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,390
要是不止这一个案子呢
Well, what if it's not just this case?

848
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,800
要是每次他都是在耍我们呢
What if he's done this to us every single time?

849
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,050
警局里还是有人护着我们的  是雷斯垂德
So, still got some friends on the force. It's Lestrade.

850
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,030
他说他们正赶过来
Says they're all coming over here now.

851
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,110
所有被你弄得没面子的警官
Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs.

852
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,230
都排着队要来拷你呢
Every officer you've ever made feel like a tit,

853
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,590
那可是不少人呢
which is a lot of people.

854
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,910
抱歉  是不是打扰你们了
Sorry, am I interrupting?

855
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,570
有人送来一个包裹  我给忘了
Some chap delivered a parcel, I forgot,

856
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:01,720
上面标记说易腐烂
marked perishable.

857
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,280
我只好签收了
I had to sign for it.

858
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,030
名字挺滑稽  是德语  像是童话里的
Funny name, German, like the fairy tales.

859
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,120
烧焦了
Burnt to a crisp.

860
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,120
这是什么意思
What does it mean?

861
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,890
- 警察  - 我去开门
- Police! - I'll go.

862
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,600
夏洛克
Sherlock.

863
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,650
- 抱歉  赫德森太太  - 我们得谈谈
- Excuse me, Mrs Hudson. - We need to talk to you.

864
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,000
别就这么闯进来呀
Don't barge in like that!

865
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,560
你们有逮捕令吗  有吗
Have you got a warrant? Have you?

866
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,820
别插手  约翰
Leave it, John.

867
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,240
讲点礼貌
Manners!

868
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:39,520
夏洛克・福尔摩斯  我现在
Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you

869
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,290
以涉嫌诱拐和绑架的罪名逮捕你
on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.

870
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,090
- 没关系  约翰  - 他没有反抗
- It's OK, John. He's not resisting...

871
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,000
不  这怎么会没关系  这太荒谬了
No, it's not all right, this is ridiculous.

872
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,800
现在带他下楼
Get him downstairs now.

873
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:48,690
你真不该这么做
You really don't have to do this.

874
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,160
别妨碍公务  不然我连你一起逮捕
Don't try to interfere or I shall arrest you too.

875
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,270
你满意了吗
You done?

876
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,500
我早就说过
I said it.

877
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,370
- 我们初次见面的时候  - 算了吧
- First time we met. - Don't bother.

878
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,020
他不会满足于破案
Solving crimes won't be enough.

879
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,660
总有一天  他会越过底线
One day he'll cross the line.

880
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,470
你自己想想  什么人会去绑架孩子
Now ask yourself, what sort of man would kidnap those kids

881
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,870
就为了通过找回他们来显摆自己
just so he can impress us all by finding them?

882
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,300
- 多诺万  - 长官
- Donovan? - Sir?

883
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,260
- 人抓住了吗  - 是的  长官
- Got our man? - Yes, sir.

884
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,890
要我说的话  看着他就觉得古怪
Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me.

885
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,130
这种义警通常都这样
Often are, these vigilante types.

886
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,590
你看什么呢
What are you looking at?

887
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,180
你还好吗  长官
Are you all right, sir?

888
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,390
- 来跟我作伴了  - 是的
- Joining me? - Yeah.

889
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,940
显然打总警司一拳
Well, apparently it's against the law

890
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,980
属于违法行为
to chin the Chief Superintendent.

891
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,740
这可不太聪明
Bit awkward this.

892
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,750
这下没人来保释我们了
There's no- one to bail us.

893
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,790
我更倾向于现在就大胆逃跑
I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape.

894
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,710
- 所有单位到27区  - 什么
- All units to 27. - What?

895
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,410
所有单位到2
All units to 2...

896
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,500
女士们  先生们  请你们趴下好吗
Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees?

897
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:59,200
- 最好现在就趴下  - 照他说的做
- NOW would be good! - Do as he says!

898
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,110
提醒你们一声  枪是他夺的
Just so you're aware, the gun is his idea,

899
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,850
我就是个  你知道
I'm just a... you know.

900
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:05,680
我的人质
My hostage.

901
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,640
人质  没错  这个可以有
Hostage, yes, that works.

902
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,060
这个可以有
That works.

903
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,170
现在怎么办
So what now?

904
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,520
如莫里亚蒂所愿  做个逃犯  跑
Doing what Moriarty wants, becoming a fugitive. Run!

905
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,810
追上他  雷斯垂德
Get after him, Lestrade!

906
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,510
抓紧我的手
Take my hand.

907
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,540
这下肯定要被人闲话了
Now people will definitely talk.

908
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,220
- 枪掉了  - 别管了
- The gun! - Leave it!

909
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,400
夏洛克  等等
Sherlock, wait!

910
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,730
我们得协调一致才行
We're going to need to coordinate.

911
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,160
往右边去  往你右边去
Go to your right. Go to your right.

912
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,650
每个人都宁可信其有
Everybody wants to believe it,

913
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,720
这就是其高明之处
that's what makes it so clever.

914
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,050
一个比真相更受人青睐的谎言
A lie that's preferable to the truth.

915
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:55,950
我的演绎法是骗人的
My deductions were a sham.

916
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,550
大家都舒坦了  夏洛克毫无过人之处
No- one feels inadequate, Sherlock's an ordinary man.

917
00:55:58,550 --> 00:55:59,910
麦考夫  他能帮我们
Mycroft, he could help us.

918
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,170
现在真不是打亲情牌的好时机
Big family reconciliation, now's not really the moment.

919
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,960
夏洛克
Sherlock...

920
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:08,970
有人跟来了
we're being followed.

921
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,300
我就知道躲不过警察
I knew we couldn't outrun the police.

922
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,160
那人不是警察
That's not the police,

923
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,950
是咱们贝克街上的新邻居
it's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street.

924
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,190
看他能不能给我们答案
Let's see if he can give us some answers.

925
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,590
我们去哪儿
Where are we going?

926
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,290
我们要冲到那辆巴士前面
We're going to jump in front of that bus.

927
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,620
你想从我这里得到什么
Tell me what you want from me.

928
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,720
告诉我
Tell me!

929
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,760
他放在你公寓里了
He left it at your flat.

930
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:45,420
- 谁  - 莫里亚蒂
- Who? - Moriarty.

931
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:46,740
放了什么
What?

932
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,220
- 程序代码  - 这就对了
- The computer key code. - Of course.

933
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,390
他公开售卖
He's selling it.

934
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,410
闯进伦敦塔的程序
The programme he used to break into the Tower.

935
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,530
他是在来的时候动的手脚
He planted it when he came around.

936
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,070
它可以扭转局面
It's a game- changer.

937
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,070
它是把钥匙  能攻破任何系统
It's a key, it can break into any system

938
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,340
此时此刻就在我们公寓
and it's sitting in our flat right now.

939
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,830
所以他留下那个信息
That's why he left that message,

940
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,190
告诉大家该去哪里  "去找夏洛克"
telling everyone where to come, "Get Sherlock!"

941
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,300
我们必须回公寓找到它
We need to get back into the flat and search.

942
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,150
刑事调查局在那守着
CID will be camped out.

943
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,580
为什么栽赃给你
Why plant it on you?

944
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,370
又一个搞坏我名声的歪点子
It's another subtle way of smearing my name,

945
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,200
现在我成了那些罪行的最大嫌疑人
now I'm best pals with all those criminals.

946
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,780
你看过这个吗
Yeah, well, have you seen this?

947
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,540
大爆料
A kiss- and- tell.

948
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,950
夏洛克  骇人听闻的真相
密友理查・布鲁克彻底坦白

949
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,180
一个叫理查・布鲁克的家伙
Some bloke called Rich Brook.

950
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,160
这人是谁
Who is he?

951
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,450
现在发表声明是不是太晚了
Too late to go on the record?

952
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,750
恭喜了  "夏洛克・福尔摩斯的真相"
Congratulations, "The Truth About Sherlock Holmes."

953
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:20,070
谁都想要的独家  而你搞到了  漂亮
The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo!

954
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,530
我给过你机会
I gave you your opportunity.

955
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,000
我本想站在你这边  记得吗
I wanted to be on your side, remember?

956
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,360
你拒绝了我  所以...
You turned me down, so...

957
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,070
然后就有大惊喜  有人爆出猛料
Then lo and behold, someone spills all the beans.

958
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,000
真是心想事成  布鲁克是谁
How utterly convenient. Who is Brook?

959
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,730
说吧  姬蒂  鬼才相信电话爆料
Come on, Kitty, no- one trusts the voice at the end of a phone.

960
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,510
毫无疑问  咖啡馆里碰面
All those little meetings in cafes,

961
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,670
酒店房间里会谈
those sessions in the hotel room

962
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,240
他对着采访机侃侃而谈
when he gabbled into your Dictaphone.

963
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,560
你怎么就相信他了呢
How do you know that you can trust him?

964
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,460
一个揣着圣杯冒出来的家伙
A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets.

965
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,420
他怎么让你信服的呢
What were his credentials?

966
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,390
亲爱的  买不到咖啡粉煮的
Darling, they didn't have any ground coffee,

967
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:52,630
我就买了普通的
so I just got normal.

968
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,750
你说过他们不可能找到这里来
You said that they wouldn't find me here,

969
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,120
你说过我在这里很安全
you said that I'd be safe here.

970
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,000
你很安全
You are safe.

971
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,010
理查  我是证人
Richard, I'm a witness,

972
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,500
他们不会当着证人的面伤害你
they wouldn't harm you in front of witnesses.

973
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,170
这就是你的爆料人
So that's your source?

974
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,400
莫里亚蒂就是理查・布鲁克
Moriarty is Richard Brook?

975
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,160
他就是理查・布鲁克  不存在莫里亚蒂
Of course he's Richard Brook, there is no Moriarty.

976
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:16,830
从来就没有这个人
There never has been.

977
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:18,630
- 你说什么胡话  - 仔细看看他
- What are you talking about? - Look him up.

978
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,860
理查・布鲁克  夏洛克雇来扮演莫里亚蒂的人
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty.

979
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,000
华生医生  我知道你是好人
Dr Watson, I know you're a good man,

980
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,930
不要  不要伤害我
don't, don't, don't hurt me.

981
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,420
不对  你是莫里亚蒂  他就是莫里亚蒂
No, you are Moriarty! He's Moriarty!

982
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,870
我们见过  记得吗  你想把我炸死
We've met, remember? You were going to blow me up!

983
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,940
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

984
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,990
他出钱雇我  而我需要活儿
He paid me, I needed the work.

985
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,350
我是个演员  我失业了
I'm an actor, I was out of work.

986
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,060
夏洛克  你最好解释一下
Sherlock, you'd better explain,

987
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,170
我完全搞不懂了
because I am not getting this.

988
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,150
我来解释吧  白纸黑字
I'll be doing the explaining, in print.

989
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,980
全在这里  板上钉钉的证据
It's all here, conclusive proof.

990
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,900
夏洛克是个骗子
他策划了所有的罪案

991
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,900
你虚构出金姆斯・莫里亚蒂  所谓的夙敌
You invented James Moriarty, your nemesis.

992
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,970
虚构出来的
Invented him?!

993
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,800
事实上所有的罪案都是他策划的
He invented all the crimes, actually.

994
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,100
最厉害的是凭空造出一位犯罪大师
And to cap it all, he made up a master villain.

995
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,320
- 这太扯了  - 问他啊
- Don't be ridiculous! - Ask him.

996
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,170
他就在这里  问他啊
He's right here. Just ask him.

997
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,760
- 告诉他  理查  - 得了吧  他上过庭
- Tell him, Richard. - For God's sake, this man was on trial!

998
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,430
没错  就是你付钱让他背黑锅
Yes, and you paid him, pay him to take the rap.

999
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:17,260
还保证搞定陪审团
Promised you'd rig the jury.

1000
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,800
虽然不是伦敦西区的角色  但我猜钱也不少
Not exactly a West End role, but I'll bet the money was good.

1001
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:23,310
但也不够多  否则他不会爆料
But not so good he didn't want to sell his story.

1002
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:26,040
对不起  诚心的  非常抱歉
I am sorry. I am. I am sorry.

1003
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,790
你准备发表的就是这个故事
So this is the story you're going to publish?

1004
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,450
最后的结论就是
The big conclusion of it all,

1005
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,780
莫里亚蒂只是个演员
Moriarty's an actor?

1006
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,790
他心里明白
He knows I am.

1007
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,810
我有证据  有证据  给他们看...
I have proof. I have proof. Show them...

1008
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:35,780
姬蒂  给他们看看
Kitty, show them something.

1009
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,640
好啊  拿出来我看看
Yeah, show me something.

1010
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,430
我上过电视  是儿童频道
I'm on TV. I'm on kids' TV.

1011
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,080
我讲故事
I'm the story- teller.

1012
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,240
理查・布鲁克

1013
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,860
获奖演员参演热门医疗剧

1014
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,570
我讲故事  出过DVD
I'm the story- teller. It's on DVD.

1015
01:00:58,650 --> 01:00:59,370
理查・布鲁克
简历

1016
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:00,800
告诉他
Just tell him.

1017
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,080
反正都这样了  不用瞒了
It's all coming out. It's all over.

1018
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,650
告诉他们  说啊  说啊  还瞒什么啊
Just tell them. Just tell them. Tell them! It's all over now!

1019
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,530
不要  别碰我  你休想碰我
No! Don't you touch me! Don't you lay a finger on me!

1020
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,340
你耍够了吧
Stop it now!

1021
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,080
别伤害我  不要让他过来
Don't hurt me! Don't let him get away!

1022
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:14,990
放过他
Leave him alone!

1023
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:21,810
不行不行  他还有后援
No, no, no. He'll have back- up.

1024
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,300
你知道吗  夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?

1025
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,670
我现在算是看透你了  你让我恶心
I look at you know and I can read you... and you repel me.

1026
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,270
他真能做到吗
Can he do that?

1027
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,770
彻底改变身份  把你抹黑成罪犯
Completely change his identity, make you the criminal?

1028
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:39,890
他彻底掌握了我的情况
He's got my whole life story.

1029
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,370
要想兜售一个天大的谎言
That's what you do when you sell a big lie,

1030
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:44,880
将其包裹在真相之中  看上去无懈可击
you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable.

1031
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,940
这只是你的一家之言了
It'll be your word against his.

1032
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,350
他用一天时间在人们脑袋里埋下怀疑的种子
He's been sowing doubt into people's minds for 24 hours.

1033
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:51,060
再做一件事
There's only one thing

1034
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,750
就能结束这场游戏  那就是...
he needs to do to complete his game and that...

1035
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,210
夏洛克
Sherlock?

1036
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,050
我要去做一件事
There's something I need to do.

1037
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,660
- 什么事  我能帮忙吗  - 不  我得一个人干
- What? Can I help? - No, on my own.

1038
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,850
你之前说错了  知道吗
You're wrong, you know?

1039
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,140
你的确算数
You do count.

1040
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,150
你一直都算数  我始终相信你
You've always counted and I've always trusted you.

1041
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,680
但你也说对了
But you were right.

1042
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,500
我的确有事
I'm not OK.

1043
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:36,850
你怎么了
Tell me what's wrong.

1044
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,300
茉莉  我可能快死了
Molly, I think I'm going to die.

1045
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:45,700
你需要什么
What do you need?

1046
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,770
如果我不是你所以为的样子
If I wasn't everything that you think I am,

1047
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,680
甚至不是我所以为的样子
everything that I think I am...

1048
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,720
你还愿意帮我吗
would you still want to help me?

1049
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,580
你需要什么
What do you need?

1050
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,500
你
You.

1051
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:24,320
她真的做了不少功课  那个莱利小姐
She has really done her homework, Miss Riley,

1052
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,390
这些事只有和夏洛克最亲近的人才知道
and it's things that only someone close to Sherlock could know.

1053
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,270
你最近有没有看过你弟弟的通讯录
Have you seen your brother's address book lately?

1054
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,310
只有两个名字  你跟我
Two names... yours and mine...

1055
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,590
而莫里亚蒂不是从我这里得到的
and Moriarty didn't get this stuff from me.

1056
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,420
- 约翰  - 怎么回事  你们什么关系
- John... - So how does it work, your relationship?

1057
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,830
你们是不是偶尔出去喝喝咖啡  你跟金
Do you go out for a coffee now and then, you and Jim?

1058
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:48,340
你的亲弟弟
Your own brother

1059
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:54,520
你把他的生平故事都告诉了这个疯子
and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac.

1060
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,990
我根本没打算...我根本没想过...
I never intend... I never dreamt...

1061
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:02,880
你当时就是想跟我说这件事吧
This... this is what you were trying to tell me, isn't it?

1062
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,960
"照看好他  因为我犯了个错"
"Watch his back because I've made a mistake."

1063
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,020
你怎么认识他的
How did you meet him?

1064
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:19,300
他这样的人  我们很了解  尽在掌控之中
People like him, we know about them, we watch them.

1065
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,760
但是金姆斯・莫里亚蒂
But James Moriarty...

1066
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,160
拥有前所未有的犯罪头脑
the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen,

1067
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:31,840
以及最终极的武器
and, in his pocket, the ultimate weapon.

1068
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,770
程序代码
The key code.

1069
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:38,060
区区几行程序就能畅通无阻
A few lines of computer code that can unlock any door.

1070
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,670
你绑架他就是为了套出代码
And you abducted him to try and find the key code?

1071
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,050
我们对他审问了数周
Interrogated him for weeks.

1072
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,010
- 结果呢  - 他不合作
- And? - He wouldn't play along.

1073
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,770
他只是坐着
He just sat there

1074
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,190
凝视着黑暗
staring into the darkness.

1075
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,300
唯一能让他开口的是...
The only thing that made him open up...

1076
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,250
我可以让他说话  就一点点
I could get him to talk, just a little.

1077
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:13,930
可是...
But...

1078
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,210
作为回报  你把夏洛克的故事透露给他
In return you had to offer him Sherlock's life story.

1079
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,030
所以  这个天大的谎言
So, one big lie...

1080
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,930
夏洛克是个骗子
Sherlock's a fraud,

1081
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,800
人们会相信  因为别的部分都是真的
and people will swallow it because the rest of it's true.

1082
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:32,490
莫里亚蒂想要毁了夏洛克
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right,

1083
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:37,700
而你给他送去了最强力的武器
and you have given him the perfect ammunition.

1084
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,240
约翰
John.

1085
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,390
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1086
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:52,760
算了吧
Please!

1087
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,690
转告他  好吗
Tell him, would you?

1088
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,100
我收到你的短信
I got your message.

1089
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,060
程序代码是问题的关键
The computer code is the key to this.

1090
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:11,860
把它找出来并加以使用
We find it, we can use it.

1091
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,400
用莫里亚蒂的方式击败他
Beat Moriarty in his own game.

1092
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,260
你说使用是什么意思
What do you mean use it?

1093
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,820
他用来编造了一个假身份
He used it to create a false identity

1094
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,230
我们也能篡改记录  销毁理查・布鲁克
so we can break into the records and destroy Richard Brook.

1095
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:20,790
把金・莫里亚蒂逼回来
Bring back Jim Moriarty again.

1096
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,150
他无罪释放那天
Somewhere in 221b,

1097
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:24,270
他把代码藏在了221B的某个地方
somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden.

1098
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,880
- 他碰过什么  - 一个苹果  仅此而已
- What did he touch? - An apple, nothing else.

1099
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,080
- 他写了什么吗  - 没有
- Did he write anything down? - No.

1100
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,410
\h过来玩吧
\h\h\h巴茨医院楼顶
夏・福

1101
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,790
顺便
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h带了你也许想拿回去的东西

1102
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:25,750
是我  请讲
Yeah, speaking.

1103
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,630
什么
What?

1104
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,690
怎么了  她没事吧
What happened? Is she OK?

1105
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,670
不是吧  好  我这就来
My God! Right, yes, I'm coming.

1106
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,160
- 什么事  - 是医护人员
- What is it? - Paramedics.

1107
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,460
赫德森太太受到了枪击
Mrs Hudson's been shot.

1108
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,190
怎么回事
What? How?

1109
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:40,540
没准是你引来的那些杀手  天啊
Probably one of the killers you managed to attract. Jesus! Jesus!

1110
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,910
她不行了  夏洛克  走吧
She's dying, Sherlock. Let's go.

1111
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,590
你去  我很忙
You go. I'm busy.

1112
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:45,840
- 忙  - 思考  我需要思考
- Busy?! - Thinking. I need to think.

1113
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,030
你需要...你一点儿都不关心她吗
You need to...? Doesn't she mean anything to you?

1114
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,370
上回有人碰了碰她  你就差点把他杀了
You once half- killed a man because he laid a finger on her.

1115
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,380
- 她是我房东  - 她快死了
- She's my landlady. - She's dying...

1116
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,570
你太冷血了
you machine!

1117
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,680
活见鬼  你就留在这里吧  随你便
Sod this. Sod this! You stay here if you want, on your own.

1118
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,440
我只有孤独作伴  孤独能保护我
Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.

1119
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,670
不对  保护我们的是朋友
No, friends protect people.

1120
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,350
\h\h\h我在等着你哦
金・莫

1121
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:39,580
好了
Well...

1122
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,800
终于见面了
here we are at last.

1123
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:46,000
就我们俩  夏洛克
You and me, Sherlock.

1124
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:49,370
我们的问题  终极问题
And our problem... the final problem.

1125
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,590
活着
Staying alive!

1126
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,110
无聊透顶吧
It's so boring, isn't it?

1127
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,700
一成不变
It's just staying.

1128
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:05,600
我这辈子都在找乐子
All my life I've been searching for distractions

1129
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,570
你曾经那么有趣  现在也没意思了
and you were the best distraction and now I don't even have you

1130
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,090
因为我打败了你
because I've beaten you.

1131
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:11,870
你知道吗
And you know what?

1132
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:13,510
说到底  太简单了
In the end, it was easy.

1133
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:16,480
没劲
It was easy.

1134
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,550
我只能回去找普通人玩了
Now I've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people,

1135
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,290
而到头来  你也不过和他们一样是个普通人
and it turns out you're ordinary, just like all of them.

1136
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,760
好吧
Well.

1137
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,860
你是不是开始怀疑我是不是真的了
Did you almost start to wonder if I was real?

1138
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,600
你是不是也被我耍了啊
Did I nearly get you?

1139
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,160
理查・布鲁克
Richard Brook.

1140
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,920
没人看出其中的亮点  但你看出来了
Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do.

1141
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,990
- 当然了  - 真不错
- Of course. - Attaboy.

1142
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,890
理查・布鲁克的德语就是莱辛巴赫
Richard Brook in German is Reichenbach.

1143
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,760
- 那个让我出名的案子  - 只是觉得这样很好玩啦
- The case that made my name. - Just trying to have some fun.

1144
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,780
不错啊  你这也看出来了
Good. You got that too.

1145
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,460
数字一样的节奏
Beats like digits.

1146
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:06,110
每一拍就是1  其余的都是0
Every beat is a one, every rest is a zero.

1147
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,800
二进制代码
Binary code.

1148
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,630
所以那些杀手都要救我
That's why all those assassins tried to save my life.

1149
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,060
代码就藏在我身上  藏在我脑海里
It was hidden on me, hidden inside my head.

1150
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,880
简单的几行程序代码
A few simple lines of computer code

1151
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,080
就可以破解任何系统
that can break into any system.

1152
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,520
我对那些客户说  最后一名是胆小鬼
Told all my clients, last one to Sherlock is a sissy.

1153
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:25,360
但现在我都知道了  我能用这个修改记录
But now that it's up here, I can use it to alter all the records.

1154
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,750
我能抹杀理查・布鲁克  弄回金・莫里亚蒂
I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty.

1155
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:36,720
不不不  这也太简单了
No, no, no, no, no. This is too easy.

1156
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,380
太简单了
This is too easy.

1157
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:41,360
根本就没什么代码  笨蛋
There is no key, doofus!

1158
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,860
那些数字毫无意义  一点意义都没有
Those digits are meaningless. They're utterly meaningless.

1159
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,540
你不会真以为几行程序代码
You don't really think a couple of lines of computer code

1160
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,450
就能破解全世界的系统吗
are going to crash the world around our ears?

1161
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:57,320
我好失望哦  普通人夏洛克
I'm disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock.

1162
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:02,450
- 但那个节奏  - 是巴赫的1号协奏曲  谢谢
- But the rhythm... Partita no 1! Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.

1163
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,070
- 那你又是怎么...  - 怎么黑进银行
- But then how did you... ? - How did I break into the bank,

1164
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:06,590
伦敦塔  还有监狱吗
to the Tower, to the prison?

1165
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:11,100
光天化日下的抢劫  只要有同伙就行啦
Daylight robbery! All it takes is some willing participants.

1166
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,200
好戏开始了哦

1167
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,990
我知道你会上钩  这是你的弱点
I knew you'd fall for it. That's your weakness.

1168
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,730
你总是把事情想得很聪明
You always want everything to be clever.

1169
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:24,890
我们的游戏能结束了吗  最后一幕
Shall we finish the game? One final act.

1170
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,440
幸好你选了一栋高楼  那样做效果很好
Glad you chose a tall building. Nice way to do it.

1171
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,490
做  做什么
Do it? Do what?

1172
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,070
是啊  当然了
Yes, of course.

1173
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:38,720
自杀
My suicide.

1174
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,070
天才侦探是个骗子
Genius detective proved to be a fraud.

1175
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,680
我在报纸上看到  肯定是真的
I read it in the paper so it must be true.

1176
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,500
我最爱报纸了
I love newspapers.

1177
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:47,980
还有童话故事
Fairy tales.

1178
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,940
尤其喜欢黑暗的童话
And pretty grim ones too.

1179
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:06,570
天啊  约翰  你吓死我了  警察那边没事吧
God, John, you made me jump. Is everything OK with the police?

1180
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,270
夏洛克都解决了吧
Has Sherlock sorted it all out?

1181
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,330
我的天
My God.

1182
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,860
出租车
Taxi!

1183
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,900
出租车  等等  我是警察  算是吧
Taxi! No, no, no. Police... sort of!

1184
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,060
谢了  伙计  太谢谢了
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot!

1185
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:27,280
我能证明你伪造了那个假身份
I can prove that you created an entirely false identity.

1186
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:30,020
你就自杀吧  那样省力多了
Just kill yourself. It's a lot less effort.

1187
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:33,060
跳啊
Go on.

1188
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,390
为了我
For me.

1189
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,870
好不好啦
Please!

1190
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,190
你疯了
You're insane.

1191
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:47,090
你刚刚知道吗
You're just getting that now? Wo- wo- wo!

1192
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,870
好吧
Ok.

1193
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,950
我再给你点动力
Let me give you a little extra incentive.

1194
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:56,190
要是你不跳  你朋友就会死
Your friends will die if you don't.

1195
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,180
- 约翰  - 不止是约翰  还有
- John? - Not just John. Everyone.

1196
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,800
- 赫德森太太  - 还有
- Mrs Hudson? - Everyone.

1197
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:10,640
- 雷斯垂德  - 三发子弹  三个杀手  三个死者
- Lestrade? - Three bullets, three gunmen, three victims.

1198
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,970
没有人能阻止他们了
There's no stopping them now...

1199
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:17,450
除非他们看到你跳楼
unless my people see you jump.

1200
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,810
尽管逮捕我  折磨我好了
You can have me arrested, you can torture me,

1201
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,860
你想拿我怎么样随便你
you can do anything you like with me,

1202
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,670
但没什么能阻止他们扣下扳机
but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger.

1203
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:37,360
你在这世上唯一的三个朋友死定了
Your only three friends in the world will die unless...

1204
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,880
- 除非  - 我自杀  成就你的故事
- Unless... - I kill myself and complete your story.

1205
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,020
你得承认  这样更吸引人
You've got to admit, that's sexier.

1206
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:48,930
- 我声名狼藉地死去  - 当然了  这才是重点
- And I die in disgrace. - Of course. That's the point of this.

1207
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,370
你现在有观众了哦
You've got an audience now.

1208
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,350
请吧
Off you pop.

1209
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,740
跳吧
Go on.

1210
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,500
我告诉过你故事的结局
I told you how this ends.

1211
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:07,100
只有你死
Your death is the only thing

1212
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,150
杀手才会收手
that's going to call off the killers.

1213
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,580
我肯定不会这么做
I'm certainly not going to do it.

1214
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,760
你能给我点时间吗
Would you give me one moment, please?

1215
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,770
让我一个人待会
One moment of privacy.

1216
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,110
拜托了
Please.

1217
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,250
当然可以
Of course.

1218
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:51,470
什么
What?!

1219
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:53,530
你笑什么
What is it?

1220
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,040
你知道了什么
What did I miss?

1221
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:03,210
你不会这么做
You're not going to do it.

1222
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,070
所以还有办法让杀手收手
So the killers can be called off,

1223
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:08,720
有个代码  暗号或数字
then there's a recall code or a word or a number.

1224
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,620
如果我有你
I don't have to die

1225
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,770
我就不用死
if I've got you.

1226
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:20,290
你觉得你能让我下令让他们住手吗
You think you can make me stop the order?

1227
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,930
- 你觉得你能做到吗  - 当然
- You think you can make me do that? - Yes.

1228
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:28,110
- 你也这么觉得  - 夏洛克  你哥哥和整个政府的人
- So do you. - Sherlock, your big brother and all the King's horses

1229
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:30,080
都不能逼我做我不想做的事
couldn't make me do a thing I didn't want to.

1230
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,410
是的  但我不是我哥哥  记得吗
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember?

1231
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,790
我是你
I am you.

1232
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:37,930
准备好做任何事
Prepared to do anything.

1233
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,100
准备好毁灭一切
Prepared to burn.

1234
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,420
准备好做普通人做不到的事
Prepared to do what ordinary people won't do.

1235
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,010
你想和我在地狱里相见吗
You want me to shake hands with you in hell?

1236
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:48,280
那我奉陪
I shall not disappoint you.

1237
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,140
不
Nah.

1238
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,610
你这话说大了
You talk big.

1239
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,210
才不是呢
Nah.

1240
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,900
你是普通人
You're ordinary.

1241
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,380
你是普通人  你站在正义那一方
You're ordinary. You're on the side of the angels.

1242
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:04,880
我也许是站在正义那一方
I may be on the side of the angels,

1243
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,010
但这绝不代表我和他们是一种人
but don't think for one second that I am one of them.

1244
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,930
对
No...

1245
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,160
你不是
you're not.

1246
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:31,710
我懂了
I see.

1247
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,310
你不是普通人
You're not ordinary.

1248
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,200
不是
No.

1249
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,250
你是我
You're me.

1250
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,050
你就是我
You're me.

1251
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,670
谢谢
Thank you...

1252
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,090
夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes.

1253
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:01,510
谢谢你了
Thank you.

1254
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,640
上帝保佑你
Bless you.

1255
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,480
只要我还活着
As long as I'm alive,

1256
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,680
你就能救你的朋友  你就会有退路
you can save your friends, you've got a way out.

1257
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,370
那就祝你好运了
Well, good luck with that.

1258
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,050
不
No.

1259
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,780
是的  先生  谢谢  再见
Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye.

1260
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,790
喂
Hello?

1261
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,910
- 约翰  - 夏洛克  你没事吧
- John. - Hey, Sherlock. Are you OK?

1262
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,530
转过身  往回走  我这就来
Turn around and walk back the way you came. I'm coming in.

1263
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:48,150
照我说的做
Just do as I ask!

1264
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,780
求你了
Please.

1265
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,850
在哪
Where?

1266
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,250
停在那别动
Stop there.

1267
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,790
- 夏洛克  - 好了  抬头  我在屋顶上
- Sherlock? - OK, look up. I'm on the rooftop.

1268
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,750
天啊
God.

1269
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:05,670
我不能下来  所以我们只能这么说话了
I... I can't come down, so we'll just have to do it like this.

1270
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:07,970
怎么了
What's going on?

1271
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,440
我要道歉
An apology.

1272
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,270
这一切都是真的
It's all true.

1273
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,730
什么
What?

1274
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:22,050
他们说的关于我的一切  我创造了莫里亚蒂
Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty.

1275
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,130
你为什么要这么说
Why are you saying this?

1276
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:33,720
我是个冒牌货
I'm a fake.

1277
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:37,640
- 夏洛克  - 报纸上写的都是真的
- Sherlock... - The newspapers were right all along.

1278
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:40,650
我要你告诉雷斯垂德
I want you to tell Lestrade,

1279
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,120
告诉赫德森太太和茉莉
I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly.

1280
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,890
告诉所有相信你的人
In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you...

1281
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,860
我为了自己创造了莫里亚蒂
that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.

1282
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,130
好了  闭嘴  夏洛克  别说了
OK, shut up Sherlock. Shut up.

1283
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:59,070
我们第一次见面的时候
The first time we met... the first time we met,

1284
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:02,730
- 你就对我姐姐的事了如指掌吧  - 没人能这么聪明
- you knew all about my sister, right? - Nobody could be that clever.

1285
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,040
你就可以
You could.

1286
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,420
我调查了你
I researched you.

1287
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,360
我们见面之前  我查了所有关于你的资料
Before we met, I discovered everything that I could

1288
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,740
就为了让你印象深刻
to impress you.

1289
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,630
这只是个把戏罢了
It's a trick. Just a magic trick.

1290
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:27,010
不  快别说了
No. All right, stop it now.

1291
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,750
不  站在那别动
No. Stay exactly where you are.

1292
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,340
- 别动  - 好吧
- Don't move. - All right.

1293
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,430
好好看着我
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

1294
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:39,780
- 求你了  你能为我做这件事吗  - 什么事
- Please, will you do this for me? - Do what?

1295
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,410
这通电话
This phone call, it's...

1296
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,100
是我的遗言
it's my note.

1297
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,340
人们都会这么做的吧
It's what people do, don't they?

1298
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,120
留遗言
Leave a note?

1299
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,830
留什么鬼遗言啊
Leave a note when?

1300
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:00,800
- 再见  约翰  - 不  不要
- Goodbye, John. - No. Don't...

1301
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,350
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1302
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:17,790
夏洛克
Sherlock.

1303
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:06,890
夏洛克
Sherlock... Sherlock.

1304
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:11,980
我是医生  让我过去  快让我过去
I'm a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please.

1305
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:15,170
他是我朋友  是我朋友  求求你们
He's my friend. He's my friend... Please.

1306
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,180
求你们了  让我...
Please, let me just...

1307
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:41,240
上帝啊
Jesus!

1308
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,530
不
No.

1309
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,280
这不是真的
God, no.

1310
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:51,320
冒牌天才自杀

1311
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,240
你有什么想说
There's stuff that you wanted to say...

1312
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:31,020
- 却没有说的话  - 嗯
- but didn't say it. - Yeah.

1313
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,160
现在说出来吧
Say it now.

1314
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,020
对不起  我做不到
Sorry, I can't.

1315
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,310
所有那些东西  那些科学仪器
There's all the stuff. All the science equipment.

1316
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:01,500
我都装在盒子里了  不知道该怎么办
I left it all in boxes. I don't know what needs doing.

1317
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:03,750
我觉得还是捐给学校吧
I thought I'd take it to a school.

1318
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:06,140
你要不要...
Would you...?

1319
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:09,480
我现在暂时没法回去  我要缓一缓
I can't go back to the flat again, not at the moment.

1320
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,440
我好生气
I'm angry.

1321
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,720
没事的  约翰  这没什么奇怪
It's OK, John. There's nothing unusual in that.

1322
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,000
他让每个人都生气
That's the way he made everyone feel.

1323
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:32,550
夏洛克・福尔摩斯

1324
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:24,010
看他在我桌子上留下的记号  还有那些噪音
All the marks on my table and the noise,

1325
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:27,350
- 在凌晨一点半开枪  - 是啊
- firing guns at half past one in the morning... - Yeah.

1326
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,550
还把该死的标本放在我冰箱里
Bloody specimens in my fridge.

1327
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:32,520
- 你怎么能在放吃的地方放尸体  - 是啊
- Imagine, keeping bodies where there's food. - Yes.

1328
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,670
还打架  还把墙壁弄得乱七八糟
And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings- on.

1329
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,410
听着  我其实没有这么生气  好吗
Listen, I'm not actually that angry, OK?

1330
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:43,100
好吧  我让你一个人待会
OK. I'll leave you alone to, you know...

1331
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:01,550
你曾经对我说过
You... you told me once...

1332
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,770
你不是个英雄
that you weren't a hero.

1333
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,360
我也曾一度以为你不是人
There were times I didn't even think you were human,

1334
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,640
但我要对你说  你是...
but let me tell you this, you were...

1335
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,640
我认识的...
the best man...

1336
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:18,250
最出色...最有人情味的人
the most human... human being that I've ever known

1337
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:22,110
没有人能让我相信  你对我说的这一切都是在骗我
and no- one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, so...

1338
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:24,600
就这样
there.

1339
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:34,540
我好孤单
I was so alone...

1340
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:37,950
我欠你好多
and I owe you so much.

1341
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:45,800
但是  求你了  再求你一件事  就一件事
But, please, there's just one more thing, one more thing,

1342
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,960
就一个奇迹  夏洛克  为了我  求你不要...
one more miracle, Sherlock, for me, don't be...

1343
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,810
不要死
dead.

1344
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:55,770
可以吗  就当是为了我
Would you do that just for me?

1345
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:58,300
别这样  不要这么对我
Just stop it. Stop this.

1346
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:59,230
