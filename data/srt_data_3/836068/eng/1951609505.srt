00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,900
It means a lot to her
to feel included.

00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,900
<i>Sometimes dark clouds</i>
<i>have silver linings...</i>

00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,000
(Susan)
He sort of asked me out.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It’s okay with you
if I go out with him?
- <i>sometimes they don't.</i>

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Once that baby comes,
I’m gonna be stuck

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,500
raising a child alone.
- <i>when it comes to life</i>
<i>on Wisteria Lane...</i>

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,600
Will you marry me?

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,500
<i>Things that seem</i>
<i>too good to be true...</i>

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,100
Does she know you killed your wife?
- <i>usually turn out...</i>

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,900
Get away from him now
while you can.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,500

<i>(Mary Alice)</i>
<i>Brides are sensitive creatures,</i>

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>and no one knows this better</i>
<i>than the bridesmaids</i>

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,300
<i>who have to deal with them.</i>

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,100
Well, I think
a 10-foot train is great,

18

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,800
but a shorter one
would be just as nice,

19
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,100
and you wouldn't have to worry
about people tripping on it.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Personally,
I love smoked rabbit,

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,500
but for a sure crowd-pleaser,
you can't beat chicken.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,100
Uh, sure, who doesn't love
a string quartet?

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,000
But if you got a band,
maybe people could dance,

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,000
as opposed to sway.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,800
<i>But the one area</i>
<i>where a bridesmaid's tact</i>

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,300
<i>is most required</i>
<i>involves the dress...</i>

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,800
So what do you think?

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>she's required to wear.</i>

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,100
Well, um...

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,400
I’m not sure that I’ve ever
seen this shade of green before.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,900
Yeah, don't you think it'll be
gorgeous with my coloring?

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Yes, it would
look perfect.

33
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,500
For someone
with your coloring.

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,100
I mean, I was lucky
to find these--

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,300
not easy putting
a wedding together in two weeks.

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Then why the rush?

37
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
Yeah, Bree,
I’d have thought of you

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,700
as a person who wants
time to plan.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,700
Well, Orson and I
talked about it,

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,500
and we just feel, at our age --
it's silly to wait.

41
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,100
And with your help,
I’m sure we can get it all done.
- Well, we are happy…

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,700
Oh, uh, that reminds me.

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,500
I have to get a copy
of the seating chart for you.

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,400
Gaby, you are in charge
of the centerpieces.

45
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,100
And don't worry, Susan.
I will think of a job for you.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Here’s a job. How about
talking you out of marrying

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,700
a homicidal dentist?
Susan, we don't know that!

48
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,900
All we have is some
crazy woman's accusations.

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,200
His wife vanished,
and he didn't even tell Bree.

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
How much more proof
do you need?

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,100
He says he's innocent.
She believes him.

52
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,200
If we say we don't,
she'll just end up hating us.

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,500
Well, I’m sorry. I cannot
sit here on my key lime ass

54
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,000
and watch Bree make
the worst mistake of her life!

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
(Bree) ahem!

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,600
And what mistake would that be?

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,800
Well...

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
um...

59
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
honestly...

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,600
<i>yes, a bridesmaid can question</i>

61
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,300
<i>many of the bride's choices.</i>

62
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,600
These dresses are hideous.

63
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,800
<i>but the groom</i>

64
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
<i>isn't one of them.</i>

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
**

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
<i>the perfect couple...</i>

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
<i>we've all met them,</i>
<i>haven't we?</i>

72
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,500
<i>that man and woman</i>
<i>so clearly made for each other,</i>

73
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,600
<i>we feel certain they're</i>
<i>on the road to happiness.</i>

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,300
<i>but that road</i>
<i>has many detours,</i>

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>and even perfect couples</i>
<i>can find themselves...</i>

76

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,100
<i>at a dead end. </i>

77
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,600
(Carlos) you want what?!

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
You heard me.

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,100
And I want the bedroom stereo.
I want the marble console

80
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
and that painting
of St. Augustine.

81
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,600
You don't even know
who he is.

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,200
I know he matches the drapes.
- People, can we focus here?

83
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,200
And I want
my pearl necklace back.

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
Don’t think I didn't notice that you swiped it.
- That was my Mamá's

85
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,900
I think it belongs
in <i>my</i> family.
- There was a time

86
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,000
I belonged in your family,
and you got over that.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,300
Stop eating my fries!
- I’m hungry.

88
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,000
You know
what the doctor said.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,500
You should see his cholesterol.
This man bleeds baking grease.
- Enough!

90
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,700
You two are gonna have to find
a way to deal with each other,

91
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,000
because you are about to bring
a child into this world.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,200
And divorced or not,

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,100
once that child arrives,
you will be bound together

94
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,300
for as long as you live.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,700
Well, in that case...

96
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,800
Have some more fries.

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,800
I’ll pick Kayla up
on Sunday.

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,600
Whenever. Just go.
You and Turk have a great time.

99
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,500
Oh, trust me, we will.

100
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,100
The man is a jackhammer.
- Ah.

101
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,400
Bye, Tom.
Bye.

102
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,900
See you Sunday!

103
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,200
Where is <i>she</i> goin'?

104
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,100
She and Turk
are going down to the river

105
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,800
for the weekend.

106
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,800
That’s Turk?
That’s the new boyfriend?

107
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,000
Unh-unh, no.
Hey, hey, hey, Tom, please.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,500
I don't want my daughter hanging
around with a guy like that.

109
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
You haven't even met him.

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,100
He could be the sweetest man
in the world.

111
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,300
(squeals)
Ha ha! Ooh.

112
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
More importantly, ever since
he entered the picture,

113
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
squeaky Fromme
is never around.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,500
It has been bliss.

115
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,200
I haven't made this face...
in a week.

116
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,600
If you ruin this,
so help me, I will hurt you.

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Just look at him.
look at him, please.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,500
I swear,
that is a child's skull

119
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,400
hanging from
his rearview mirror.

120
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
Doesn’t that concern you?

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,500
No, I’m good.

122
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,600
Could be a monkey.

123
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,200
Uh, I think
I will have the...

124
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,500
Mesclun salad.

125
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,100
That’s it?
That’s all you're having?

126
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,800
(whispering) well,
all the food is very expensive.

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,200
You don't need to whisper.

128
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,800
The waiter knows
they're robbing us blind.

129
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,500
You can have
whatever you want.

130
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,600
In that case,
I'll have the lobster bisque

131
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
and the veal
with the black truffles.

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,400
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's fine.

133
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,700
I'll just have Jane moved
to the V.A. hospital.
- Oh, my god.

134
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,100
I’m kidding. It’s fine.

135
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll have
what she's having.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
Of course. Thank you.

137
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,400
God, I love
seeing you laugh.

138
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
Oh, well,
it's been a long time

139
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,500
since I've been in the mood to.
- Thank you.

140
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,800
Oh, dear god!

141
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
Did I squeeze too hard?

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,400
No,
it's my wife's parents.

143
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,200
Oh! Oh, wow!

144
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,500
Oh, is this
gonna be awkward?

145
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,800
No, no, no, not unless,
of course, they see us.

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,900
(man) Ian?
- Awkward.

147
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,400
Jeff, Renee,
what a delightful surprise.

148
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,100
(chuckles)


149
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,700
It’s so good
to see you, dear.

150
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,100
Hello. I’m Renee,

151
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,400
and this my husband Jeff.
Susan Mayer.

152
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,000
Uh, doctor...

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Dr. Susan Mayer--she's new
To Jane’s neurology team.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,300
Oh!

155
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,000
I just assumed you worked
In Ian’s publishing house.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,400
Well, yes, and how--how nice
that would've been, huh?

157
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Um, but, no, no,
I’m a...

158
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
a brain specialist.

159
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,100
Well, Dr. Mayer,
maybe I can ask you,

160
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,700
our daughter's most recent
E.E.G. showed brain spikes,

161
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,500
but it didn't change
the score

162
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
on the Glasgow scale.

163
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,200
Why is that?

164
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,200
What an excellent question.

165
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,000
And this is the, uh...

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,300
spinal cord.
- Uh-huh.

167
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,400
And it, of course,
attaches to the brain.

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,500
You don't have to
dumb it down for us, doctor.

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,300
We’ve been dealing
with Jane’s condition for years.

170
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,600
Oh, good. Um, well,
then let's--let's get technical.

171
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
Uh, let's give
Dr. Mayer the night off.

172
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
She was in surgery
for ten hours today

173
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,700
performing a craniotomy.

174
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,900
That’s exactly the procedure
Jane had. How’d it go?

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Uh, well, it just--

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Wow!

177
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,200
I hear my--
my phone vibrating.

178
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,600
Um, hello, uh, Dr. Mayer.

179
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, what?

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You say that
his brain shut off?

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,300
Oh, well,
I'll be right there.

182
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,600
Um, stat. I’m sorry.
(chuckles nervously) duty calls.

183
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,900
Orson?

184
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,500
I moved the furniture back!

185
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,300
Good lord, Bree,
not again.

186
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,000
<i>(jazz music playing)</i>

187
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,500
Don’t you want
our first dance to be perfect?

188
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,800
There’ll be 200 people
staring at us.

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,100
You know, Bree...

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,500
since that incident
at our engagement party,

191
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,300
there's been a lot
of dark talk about me.

192
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,500
Well, I don't pay attention
to gossip.

193
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,100
I’m just saying I would
understand if you had

194
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,400
second thoughts about marrying
a man who's under a cloud.

195
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,400
Well, no one who knows you
could seriously believe

196
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,700
that you could hurt
a woman.

197
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,500
Strangers may talk,
but I know the truth.

198
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
Really?

199
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Men have lied
to me before.

200
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,100
Believe me,
that'll never happen again.

201
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
So you trust me
completely?

202
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,000
Clearly, I do.

203
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,400
The body is unusually
well-preserved

204
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
because it was buried
in clay.

205
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700


Do we have
a cause of death?

206
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,100
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

207
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,500
I want you to pull
all the missing persons reports,

208
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,200
cross-check against
her height, age and weight.

209
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I’m also running
a DNA panel

210
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,900
since we won't be able
to use her dental records.

211
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,100
Why not?

212
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,400
Whoever killed her
pulled out all her teeth.

213
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,300
Nora? What are you doing back?
Are you okay?

214
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,400
Shut the door!

215
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,700
Okay.

216
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,600
I don't want Kayla
to find me like this.

217
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
What’s wrong?

218
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,100
Turk and I had a fight.

219
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,600
What? No! No, no, no!
What happened?

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
What happened is,
Turk is an ass!

221
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,200
On the way to the river,
we stopped off at this bar.

222
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,900
And we were playing pool,
and I got a little bitchy

223
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,800
with one of the waitresses.
Who cares, right?

224
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,100
I mean, who cares? It’s a bar,
and we all do it, right?
- R-right.

225
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,200
So he tells me
to watch my mouth.

226
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,700
And I’m like, whoa!

227
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,700
Get a load
of Mr. Two Strikes

228
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,200
trying to tell me
how to act in public.

229
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,600
And then he called me
a whore.

230
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
We’re done.

231
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay, whoa! Whoa!
Take a deep breath.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
You don't break up
with a guy

233
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
because in a weak moment
he calls you a whore.

234
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
And then on the way out,
he threatened to hit me.

235
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay, but he didn't. He didn't.
And, you know, until--

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,100
Oh, jeez, Lynette,
whose side are you on?!

237
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,400
I’m on the side of love.

238
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,100
You guys seem like
such a perfect couple.

239
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,100
I know.

240
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,400
I just--I-I...

241
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,100
You know, you don't wanna
Throw that all away

242
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,100
'cause of a <i>little</i> fight
with no hitting.

243
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,900
(sniffles loudly)

244
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,300
No. it's over.

245
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,200
I just got off the phone
with Turk’s parole officer,

246
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,900
and I was like, "guess who ain't
in Nevada no more?" Click.

247
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
(sobbing)

248
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,500
I think I’m gonna
have to stay here tonight.

249
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
(rattling in distance)

250
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,000
(door opens in distance)

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,300
(rustling in bushes)

252
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
(loud rattling)

253
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,500
(grunting)

254
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Freeze!

255
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,000
Austin?

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
Hey, aunt Edie.

257
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
Anyway...

258
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,500
Mom just got back
from her cruise to Jamaica

259
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,000
with new boobs
and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
- Ooh.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,800
Needless to say,

261
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,000
me and Mr. "can I get you
some more hot towels?"--

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
we didn't exactly hit it off.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,200
So after I broke his nose,
I, uh, figured it was

264
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
a great time to come visit
my favorite aunt.

265
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,900
Your mom always did have
lousy taste in men.

266
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,100
So, uh, I figured
I'd crash here for the night.

267
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,800
Then hitch down
to Mexico--

268
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,700
hang out, party.

269
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,600
Yeah, I’m thinking, like,
no way in hell.

270
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,700
You're gonna
stay here with me

271
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
until things blow over
with your mom, okay?

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,900
Cool. Thanks.

273
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, wait,
you're 18, right?

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,300
Well,
that's what my ID says.

275
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,400
Yeah, mine, too.

276
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,500
Hey, you are supposed to be
on bed rest!

277
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,900
I’m bored.
- Well, why don't you try
putting on a pair of pants?

278
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,800
That should kill
a couple of hours.

279
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,700
(doorbell rings)

280
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Hey, babe.

281
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,900
Hey, what is she doing
out of bed?

282
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
That can't be
good for her.

283
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
Or the stairs.

284
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,900
What do you want?

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
The mediator was right.

286
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,600
A month from now we're not just
gonna be Carlos and Gaby.

287
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,400
We're gonna be Mom and Dad,
and I don't wanna be at war

288
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,200
with the mother of my child,
so, here.

289
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,100
Your mamá's pearls?

290
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,700
Carlos...

291
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,900
thank you.

292
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,400
And?

293
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,800
And what?

294
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,900
Wouldn't you like to make
some reciprocal gesture?

295
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,300
Fine. You can come to Bree’s
wedding reception as my guest.

296
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,100
Thanks. Where is it?

297
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,600
Here.
Here?

298
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,600
You're throwing
the... reception?

299
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,300
Yeah, it's our wedding present
to Bree.

300
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,500
So I give you
a priceless family heirloom,

301
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,800
and in return, you invite me
to a party at my house

302
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,000
that I’m paying for?

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,100
Well, what kind of gesture
did you have in mind?

304
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,700
(scoffs)

305
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,400
Mmm.

306
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
Things I'll do
for jewelry.

307
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,300
Susan, I am <i>so</i> sorry.

308
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,900
<i>Dr.</i> Mayer?

309
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,300
Panic. Pure panic.

310
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,300
Here. These are for ruining
our first date.

311
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,700
Shh!
Not in front of Mike!

312
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Oh, look, Mike,
Ian brought you flowers.

313
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,100
I'll just go put them
in some water.

314
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,400
Look, I-I was just trying
to protect Jane’s parents.

315
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,100
Oh, please.
- They still haven't accepted the fact

316
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,200
that--that Jane
isn't going to wake up.

317
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,700
If they knew
that we were on a date,

318
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,100
that I was trying to move on,
well, it would devastate them.

319
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,400
That's a really
lovely excuse,

320
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,100
but it isn't the whole story, is it?
- Excuse me?

321
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,600
A part of you feels
that you're cheating on her.
- No!

322
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,600
Well, perhaps a small part,
but that--that doesn't mean--

323
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,400
it's all right,
'cause I feel guilty, too.

324
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,300
That--that's why we should
just stop is right now,

325
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,200
because it's
all way too complicated,

326
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
and I-I think
we'd both be happier

327
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,100
if we just went back
to being friends.

328
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,400
Well, I-I don't think
I can do that.

329
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,700
the--the truth is,

330
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,000
I haven't thought of you
as just a friend

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,700
for some time now.

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,500
Maybe I shouldn't have
let myself feel that way,

333
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
but--but I have.

334
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,800
And I can't go back.
I’m sorry.

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,600
Well, if we can't
be friends...

336
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,500
then I guess
we'll be nothing.

337
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
<i>(rap music playing loudly</i>
<i>in distance)</i>

338
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
<i>(music volume increases)</i>

339
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,300
<i>(rap music</i>
<i>continues playing loudly)</i>

340
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
(decreases volume)

341
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,500
Hey, leave that alone.

342
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,600
Sorry, I was just...

343
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,500
turning it down.

344
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,900
What, you're not
a music fan?

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,100
Sure, it's just, um...

346
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,300
Got anything where
a pimp isn't beating his ho?

347
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,600
(chuckles)

348
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,400
I’m Austin,
Edie Britt’s nephew.

349
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,600
Oh. (chuckles)

350
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,000
I’m Julie,
Susan Mayer’s daughter.

351
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,400
<i>Oh.</i>

352
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,600
Anyway, um, I was trying
to do my homework, so...

353
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,900
On a Saturday?

354
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,700
Well, make sure
and take regular breaks

355
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,200
and stop
for a sensible dinner.

356
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,900
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.

357
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,500
That's how I like it.

358
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,700
How do you like it?

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,900
You know what?

360
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,800
You're not that hot.

361
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
Hey, whatcha doing?

362
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
Oh, I’m working on
a seating chart--mwah!

363
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,100
For Bree’s wedding.

364
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,600
Nora? Who invited her?

365
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,800
I did. We need to find her
another boyfriend,

366
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,700
and weddings
are crawling with single men.

367
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Hey, I hope
you're not seating her

368
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
next to any of <i>my</i> friends.
- Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom.

369
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
No, Jerry Rawlings!
Not Jerry Rawlings!

370
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,700
Yes!
- She gets her psycho hooks
into Jerry Rawlings,

371
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,200
he will never
speak to me again.

372
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,500
Oh, there are other urologists
in the world.

373
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,200
Go back to that other guy.
- The one with the cold hands?

374
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,300
Oh, it's once a year. Suck it up.
- Get a grip, Lynette.

375
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,500
"Get a grip"?!

376
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,600
I am hanging on
for dear life here.

377
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,700
<i>You</i> are the one that brought
<i>this</i> little problem

378
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
into our family,

379
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,500
And the only thing
I should be hearing from you is,

380
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,200
"How can I help?"

381
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
I am also putting
Steve Hanson at her table,

382
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,200
so you might want
to start shopping around

383
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,300
for a new golf buddy.

384
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Get a grip.


385
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,900
(cans rattling)

386
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,600
(chuckles)

387
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Hi.
My name is Susan Mayer.

388
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,400
Your neighbor told me
I could find you here.

389
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,800
Yeah?
- Well, I was

390
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,400
at my friend
Bree’s engagement party

391
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,200
the other night--

392
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,800
you know, when you came in
and you did that whole

393
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,600
"Orson killed his wife"
thing?

394
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
I was just wondering
if you could elaborate.

395
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,200
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?

396
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,400
Well,
what makes you so sure?

397
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,800
Do you have any proof?

398
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
Look, I can't talk now.
I get off at 6:00.

399
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,000
My friend is marrying that man
in two hours. Please?

400
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,800
Okay, I-I need, um,
$10 in unrolled pennies,

401
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,900
and I need
to see you count it,

402
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,600
'cause last time
you stiffed me.

403
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,700
After Alma disappeared,

404
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,400
the police came
and searched the house.

405
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,900
The police?
What did they find?

406
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,100
Nothing.

407
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,300
And that's bad why?

408
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,600
Don't you get it?
When the police showed up,

409
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Orson had scrubbed every inch
of the place clean with bleach.

410
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
No fingerprints,

411
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,300
no skin cells, no DNA.

412
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,500
It was like
Alma had never existed.

413
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,500
Who cleans
a house like that

414
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
unless he has
something to hide?

415
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
So when I left the bank,

416
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I called the detective
that worked the case,

417
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,500
and he said that the only reason
Orson was never charged,

418
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,900
was because they never found the body.
- So he was an actual suspect?

419
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,500
He was the <i>only</i> suspect.
- Oh, my God! What are we gonna do?

420
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,000
Well, you know
what we have to do.

421
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
That was close.

422
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,600
The florist put three mums
in my bridal bouquet,

423
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,900
but not to worry.

424
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,100
Crisis averted.

425
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Bree... we have to talk.

426
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Ah, Reverend.

427
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Any word from the bridal party?

428
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,900
They're still
in the bride's room.

429
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,600
You know women.

430
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,500
They're probably in there
fussing about mascara and blush.

431
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,800
He did not hack her up
and dissolve the pieces in acid!

432
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
I said it was a theory.
The point is,

433
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,100
Alma disappeared under
very suspicious circumstances.

434
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,500
I don't have time for this.
I’m getting married now.

435
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,100
This is your day. You can push
the ceremony back an hour.

436
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,400
Now get that detective
on the phone,

437
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,900
talk things out with Orson.

438
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,600
I can't talk to Orson.
It's bad luck

439
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,700
for the groom to see
the bride before the wedding.

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,400
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.

441
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,600
If the three of you
don't drop this right now,

442
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,900
I will never forgive you.

443
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,000
Bree, we are just doing this
because we love you.

444
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,800
But...

445
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,000
if you can
honestly tell us

446
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,700
that you don't have
the slightest doubt...

447
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,200
None whatsoever.

448
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,800
Hmm.

449
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,800
(Mendelssohn’s "wedding march"
playing)

450
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,300
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here together

451
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,300
in the sight of god
to join this man and woman

452
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,600
in holy--
- Excuse me?

453
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
Could you give us
just a second?

454
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,900
Is something wrong?
- I just need a moment.

455
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
(guests murmuring)

456
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Before we do this,

457
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,100
There's something
I need to ask you.
- What?

458
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,500
Did you kill your wife?

459
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,700
Susan talked
to that Carolyn woman.

460
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,600
Why didn't you tell me that the police
searched her house?

461
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,400
Because it's embarrassing,
and they didn't find anything.

462
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,300
Is that because you scrubbed
the house so thoroughly?

463
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,100
When I’m upset, I clean.

464
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,600
For God's sake, Bree,

465
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,600
I swear to you
I did not kill my wife.

466
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,200
Okay.

467
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,800
Proceed.

468
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
Dearly beloved,

469
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,400
we are gathered here together
in the sight of God

470
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,400
to join this man and woman
in holy matrimony,

471
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
which is
an honorable estate...

472
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,807
Hey!
Look at you, miss popular!

473
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,484
so are you having
a good time over there?

474
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,976
<i>As if,</i>

475
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:49,064
and I don't know what idiot
stuck me at that table,

476
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:51,646
but every guy over there
is just a boring stiff.

477
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,018
All of them?

478
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:55,793
What about... Jerry?
Jerry's fun.

479
00:24:57,335 --> 00:25:00,802
You mean Mr. Fatty Hair Plugs?
Oh, yeah, he's a blast.

480
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,187
(imitates gunshot)

481
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,168
Um, how about Steve?

482
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,802
You know what?
I hear his family has money.

483
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:09,802
Well, then maybe
they could all chip in

484
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:11,604
and buy him
some deodorant.

485
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,457
I’m through
with those losers.

486
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:14,655
I’m gonna stay
right here with you.

487
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:17,445
Are you gonna eat that?

488
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:23,562
(gasps) Hey, look at you!

489
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:25,550
(sighs)
God, I hate wearing a tux.

490
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,741
On my way in, Bree’s aunt fern
asked me to park the car.

491
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,936
She's got glaucoma.

492
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:31,783
To her, you're nothing
but a Hispanic blur.
(chuckles)

493
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:33,886
Let me fix your tie.

494
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:37,695
Hey, you're wearing
mamá's pearls.

495
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,085
Yeah.

496
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:45,136
Oh!

497
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:47,813
Hey, Julie!

498
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,213
Have you met
my nephew Austin?

499
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:51,154
Yeah, we've met.

500
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:53,112
I just didn't recognize him
with his shirt on.

501
00:25:57,835 --> 00:25:59,701
She couldn't
take her eyes off my abs.

502
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:01,062
I felt violated.

503
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,996
Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?

504
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:09,294
It was.

505
00:26:13,382 --> 00:26:14,485
Perfect.

506
00:26:14,882 --> 00:26:17,346
Well, it's nice to see you two
getting along again.

507
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,488
We've sort of turned a corner.
- Really?

508
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:21,384
Does that mean you're gonna
be getting back together?

509
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:22,762
Maybe.
- God, no!

510
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,309
Wow, is that shrimp?

511
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:29,768
What would make you think

512
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,826
I would even consider
taking you back?

513
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,962
Well, you invited me
to be your date.

514
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:37,738
"Guest," Carlos. I said "guest."
- Come on, you've been flirting
with me since I came in--

515
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:39,170
"Here, baby,
let me fix your tie."

516
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,619
I mean, for a woman
who's not interested,

517
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,155
you sure are sending
some mixed signals.

518
00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:44,197
You want a clear signal? 
How's this?

519
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:49,001
(band playing jazz music)

520
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:50,250
Ian!
- Susan!

521
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:51,955
What are you doing here?

522
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:55,367
Well, my--my cousin is--is
Dr. Hodges' dental hygienist,

523
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:57,367
and her husband--
he--he couldn't join us

524
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:59,567
since he'd come down
with a spot of impetigo,

525
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:00,611
so she called me,

526
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:02,995
knowing how much I love
a good garter toss, and so--

527
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:03,880
Ian.

528
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:07,676
Yes, I-I’m such
a terrible liar.

529
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,907
I mean, impetigo--
where did that come from?

530
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:11,761
Hmm.

531
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:13,661
So what are you really
doing here?

532
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,545
(sighs) Look...

533
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:20,532
I can't stop
thinking about us,

534
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:22,677
about how great
we could be together,

535
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:24,557
and I think
you're making a mistake.

536
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:26,933
Ian--
Susan, please don't go.

537
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,894
Can't we at least
talk about this?

538
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:32,278
I can't, 'cause I have...
bridesmaid stuff.

539
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:37,941
Hi there.

540
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:40,355
I just wanted to say
you're doing a great job...

541
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:41,864
Tad. (chuckles)

542
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:45,160
That's, um, that's such
a masculine name.

543
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,922
My boyfriend
seems to like it.

544
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:49,984
Okay, here's the drill.

545
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,782
My ex is here,
and I wanna piss him off,

546
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:53,128
so just act like
you're all hot for me,

547
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:55,574
and there's a 100 buck tip
in it for you.
- Right.

548
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:59,401
Uh, so should I...
cup your boob?
- No, I'll drive.

549
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:04,734
(laughing loudly)

550
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:05,968
Oh!

551
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,000
Tequila, straight.

552
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,615
Hey, are there any decent
single women at this wedding?

553
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:19,625
Not that I've seen.

554
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,492
Ah, damn it. Not a one.

555
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:26,521
Hey, Carlos.

556
00:28:26,634 --> 00:28:28,488
You should come over
to our table.

557
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:30,267
That's where
all the hotties are.

558
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:31,383
Hey, everyone!

559
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:34,434
I'd say it is time that
we get Bree and Orson up here

560
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:36,585
for their first dance
as a married couple.

561
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:37,467
Ladies and Gentlemen,

562
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:41,697
I give you
Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge!

563
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,324
Orson,
you look so serious.

564
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,021
I’m trying to remember
my steps.

565
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:13,206
You're upset, aren't you?

566
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:15,588
You're still thinking about
what I said at the church.

567
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,489
Which part, darling--

568
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:18,409
the "I do" part,

569
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:20,073
or the "Did you
kill your wife?" part?

570
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,303
I’m sorry,
but I had to ask.

571
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:26,284
That's my point.

572
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:28,305
You had to ask.

573
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:34,524
(up-tempo jazz music playing)

574
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:36,924
(squealing)

575
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:39,491
You are gonna
rot in hell for this.

576
00:29:40,023 --> 00:29:42,445
Hey, I just brought
two lost souls together.

577
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,337
Okay, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.

578
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,857
he deserves every bit of
(singsong voice) "crazy"

579
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:53,742
she's gonna
rain down on him.

580
00:29:56,877 --> 00:30:00,232
Hell... rot... you.

581
00:30:02,243 --> 00:30:05,243
(slow jazz music playing)

582
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:11,656
What are they doing?

583
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,146
Rounding second
and heading for third.

584
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:19,195
Uh-oh.

585
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:23,642
Carlos!

586
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:25,955
Oh, hey, Gaby.
Look, I made a new friend.

587
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:28,134
Yes, I've been watching you
make your new friend,

588
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:31,043
and it's disgusting!
- Do you mind?
We're trying to dance here.

589
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:32,949
Who the hell are you,
anyway,

590
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:35,019
and why the hell
are you at this wedding?!

591
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:38,161
This is not
gonna end well.

592
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:41,354
They're just two random people
who met at a wedding.

593
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:43,253
Can't pin it on me.

594
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,286
It was <i>her!</i>

595
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:49,139
Lynette Scavo,
I wanna talk to you!

596
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,223
I'll see you at home.

597
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:55,043
What are you thinking?

598
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:56,190
I didn't invite you here

599
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,049
to embarrass me
in front of my friends.

600
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,836
Oh, no, you just
wanted me to watch

601
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:02,434
while you sucked the zits
off some teenage waiter!

602
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:04,917
That's it.
I take my invitation back.

603
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,851
You are no longer welcome
in my house.

604
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:10,027
Fine, I'll go!
Just give me back the pearls.

605
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,717
No!
- Gaby.

606
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,802
Carlos, no!
- They were my mamá’s!

607
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:14,367
No! (gasps)

608
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,346
Now look what you've done!

609
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,423
Mrs. Solis!

610
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:23,316
No, Carlos!
- Hey, give me that!

611
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,440
Give me those!
- Pardon me. Excuse me.

612
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:27,714
Get away! Those are mine!
No, the hell they are!

613
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:28,940
Mrs. Solis?

614
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,034
Not now, Xiao-mei!
Mrs. Solis!

615
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:32,597
Oh, for Goddess' sakes, what?!

616
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,833
(liquid splashes)

617
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:36,933
(guests gasp)

618
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,399
(woman) Are you kidding?

619
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,869
I think maybe it's time.


620
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,300
And I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.

621
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:53,100
(rim shot, applause)

622
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:54,576
Wow.

623
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,540
That was beautiful, aunt fern.
Thank you.

624
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,576
Hey, they mopped up
all the amniotic fluid,

625
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:04,178
So we should feel safe... 
Start the conga line!

626
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:06,385
(piano starts playing)
Actually, I'd--I'd like
to say a few words.

627
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:09,477
(piano stops playing)

628
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:13,361
Bree, Orson,

629
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:16,599
your love
is an inspiration to us all.

630
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,216
That's very sweet.
- Hmm.

631
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:21,115
How do you know him?

632
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,886
I thought he was on your side.
- Mnh-mnh.

633
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,043
Well, I know
this is a second wedding

634
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,227
for both of you,
and I think you're jolly brave.

635
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:31,472
So often, people find excuses
not to fall in love again.

636
00:32:31,522 --> 00:32:32,741
They're--they're afraid.

637
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:36,566
But it's rare to find somebody
that you connect with,

638
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:38,631
so when you do,
you have to follow your heart.

639
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:41,198
Bree, Orson,

640
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:43,507
I salute you.

641
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:47,566
all right, let's get
the music cranking and the--

642
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,739
Wait, actually, Tom,
could you just hang on a second?

643
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:52,540
Uh, I-I also would like
to say a few words.

644
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:55,720
To Bree and Orson, uh, yes,

645
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,572
what could be better
than a second love?

646
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:01,538
And this time you enter into it
a little older, little wiser,

647
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:02,337
but also--

648
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:04,357
and this is key--uh...

649
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:06,167
with a bit of caution.

650
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:08,989
Because...

651
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:12,750
while love can be spontaneous
and wonderful,

652
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:16,182
it can also be selfish.

653
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:17,622
And sometimes

654
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:20,673
the best thing you can do
is just to walk away.

655
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:27,958
uh... I -- 
Not you two.

656
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,075
I mean, you two crazy kids
are great. (laughs)

657
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:32,034
Congrats, yeah.

658
00:33:33,022 --> 00:33:34,113
Well, then, let's--

659
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:36,053
Hang on. I'd like
to respond to that toast.

660
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,146
Bree, Orson,

661
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,346
sometimes walking away
<i>can</i> seem the best choice.

662
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,280
It's--it's certainly
the safest.

663
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,380
But... but what do you do

664
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:47,880
when you find someone
who makes you feel joy

665
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:51,513
when you thought
you never would again?

666
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,847
Do you--
do you just let them go?

667
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:58,747
No.

668
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,847
No, I can't do that.

669
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:14,480
(microphone feedback squeaks)
You--you wanna...

670
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:18,013
No.

671
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,680
I’m good.

672
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:22,480
All right then, let's dance!

673
00:34:22,513 --> 00:34:24,780
**

674
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:38,948
Well, I thought you might
need a change of clothes.

675
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,418
You're still
mad at me, huh?

676
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,773
What were you thinking,
setting Carlos up with Skank?!

677
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:48,820
I’m sorry.
I was desperate.

678
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:51,027
I had a little too much
to drink.

679
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:53,527
And you <i>are</i> divorcing Carlos...

680
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,627
No, Lynette,
Carlos will never be fair game.

681
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,590
You know the rules.

682
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,268
You're right.
You are right. You're right.

683
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:00,425
I’m so sorry.

684
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:03,575
It's just...

685
00:35:06,244 --> 00:35:06,979
what?

686
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:10,680
I’m so unhappy.

687
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:14,564
Ever since that woman
pushed her way into our lives,

688
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:16,882
I-I can't even
work up a smile.

689
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:19,373
And the more she pushes,
the more I resent Tom--

690
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:22,590
Tom, for something he did
12 years ago.

691
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,508
And I’m afraid
if I can't fix...

692
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,590
this, that...

693
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,722
the anger is just gonna
fester until...

694
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:31,010
Lynette, listen to me--

695
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,404
You and Tom
will survive this.

696
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:36,155
No, seriously, Gaby,

697
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:39,167
I am <i>so</i> tired
of pretending to smile.

698
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,254
You and Tom...

699
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:42,749
will survive this.

700
00:35:43,137 --> 00:35:44,113
Yeah?

701
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,316
How can you be so sure?

702
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,207
Because some marriages
were built to last...

703
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,839
and some aren't.

704
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,151
Trust me,
I know the difference.

705
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:05,735
(applause)

706
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,635
(both chuckle)

707
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,200
I’m looking
for Bree van de Kamp.

708
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,545
Right over there.

709
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:14,416
Could you excuse me
for just a minute?

710
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:14,831
Mm-hmm.

711
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:20,850
Orson, congratulations.

712
00:36:20,884 --> 00:36:23,765
Excuse me.
Are you Mrs. van de Kamp?

713
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:25,464
It's Hodge now.

714
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,471
Yes, I’m terribly sorry
to barge in like this,

715
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:30,789
but we need your husband
to come down to the morgue.

716
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:33,438
We may have found
his wife's body.

717
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,238
(grunting)

718
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,531
Push, Xiao-mei. Push.

719
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,737
(groaning)

720
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:50,630
Okay, okay.

721
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,206
Deep breaths now.
You're getting close.

722
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:55,277
It's time! I can't believe
this is happening!

723
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:57,027
I think I’m gonna cry.

724
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,809
Carlos,
I am so sorry about the--

725
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:03,491
Yeah, I--me, too. Me, too.
I was way out of line.

726
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:06,683
I forgive you. It's worth it
when you experience

727
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,452
a moment
as beautiful as this.

728
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:11,449
(grunting)

729
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:12,056
Okay,
I can see the head now.

730
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:13,971
Oh, get the camera!
Get the camera!

731
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:18,736
(grunting)

732
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,079
Oh!

733
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:21,834
(Gaby) Oh, my God!


734
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,869
(baby crying)

735
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:35,704
Oh, man,

736
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,297
I gotta get the color fixed
on this thing.

737
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:47,970
How could this
have happened?

738
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,369
What kind of half-ass fertility
clinic are you running?

739
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,748
Uh, prior to implantation,

740
00:37:50,798 --> 00:37:53,699
our embryo was accidentally
switched with another client's.

741
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,809
So if we got theirs
and they got ours,

742
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:57,922
then--then it's possible...

743
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:00,103
No, I’m afraid
your embryo didn't take.

744
00:38:00,122 --> 00:38:03,041
Again, on behalf of the clinic,
I am so sorry.

745
00:38:03,505 --> 00:38:06,166
It's rare, but these things do happen.
- Excuse me.

746
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,685
You screw up our lives,
and the best you can do is,

747
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,536
"That's the way
the cookie crumbles"?!

748
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:11,712
And who is this guy?

749
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,987
Why is he writing down everything I say?
- This is Mr. Darby, our attorney.

750
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:16,594
We thought it wise
to have him present.

751
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,528
Do you know what else
would've been wise?

752
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:21,287
Sticking the right baby
in the right belly!

753
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:23,090
Mrs. Solis, please.

754
00:38:50,071 --> 00:38:51,223
That's not Alma.

755
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:56,103
Are you sure?

756
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:56,963
Absolutely.

757
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,503
Thank God.

758
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,039
Carolyn.
What is she doing here?

759
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,829
You didn't honestly think

760
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:10,443
they'd take your word
for it, did you?

761
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:18,269
It's not her.

762
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:24,194
Well, that's it then.
Sorry for wasting your time.

763
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:25,706
This means nothing.

764
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,580
I’m telling you,
that man is as guilty as sin!

765
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,731
We know what you think.

766
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:32,095
Now would you please
leave us alone?

767
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,426
He's a cold-blooded killer.

768
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:37,655
He's kind and decent,
and nothing you could say

769
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:39,130
will ever make me
doubt him again.

770
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,058
Now please go.

771
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:48,730
You deserve him.

772
00:39:55,264 --> 00:39:58,230
Darling, I am so sorry
you had to endure that.

773
00:39:58,264 --> 00:39:59,494
Are you all right?

774
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:02,011
I’m fine. Let's just go back
to our guests

775
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:05,124
and forget any of this ever happened.
- All right.

776
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:15,277
<i>Tu me manques,</i> Monique.

777
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:31,722
Well...

778
00:40:31,755 --> 00:40:32,355
Yeah.

779
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:36,421
