6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,150
我觉得对我来说时机不合适
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I-I don't think it's the best time for me right now.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,650
你没有别的选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't really have a choice here.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,330

我想帮助他最好的方式
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think maybe the best way to help him

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,910

告诉他外遇和孩子的事情你都知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell him you know about the affair and the baby.

26

如果...他没有选我怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What if... he doesn't choose me?

27

你难道还没受够这些谎言吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aren't you done with all the lies?

我也害怕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm scared, too.

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,500
我一旦告诉你

40
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,860
我要死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm going to die.

41
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,320
我不确定什么时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not sure when.

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,550
我只知道有一天我会离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just know one day I won't be here.

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,540
我害怕与上帝见面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm afraid to meet God.

44
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,500
我得为我的罪行负责
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll have to account for my sins.

45
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,580
我罪孽深重
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have sinned a lot.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,040
我和一个有妇之夫有染
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I had an affair with a married man.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,170
我睡了另一个男人的老婆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I slept with another guy's wife.

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,610
我和一对夫妻做爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I had sex with a married couple

49
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,790
我差不多和我遇见过的所有人都发生过关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and pretty much everyone else I ever met.

50
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,100
现在我未婚却有了身孕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now I'm pregnant and unmarried.

51
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,850
我妈妈不知道我坠入爱河
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My mom has no idea I've fallen in love.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,470
泰勒不知道是我给了伊莱毒品
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor doesn't know I gave Eli drugs.

53
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,760
我不会告诉罗伯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not going to tell Rob.

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,000
我要向萨蒙妮求婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm gonna propose to Simone.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,240
我八成会否定一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll probably deny everything.

56
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,660
等我见到上帝时  我会乞求祂的宽恕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When I do meet God, I'll just beg his forgiveness.

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,590
我会感谢祂让我遇见了完美女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll thank him for sending me the perfect woman.

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,780
我会说我做了我必须做的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll say I did what I had to

59
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,030
只为求生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to survive.

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,420
希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila.

61
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,800
我的天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God.

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,260
我一直如坐针毡  你昨晚和罗伯谈了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've been on pins and needles. Did you talk to Rob last night?

63
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,430
谈了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I did.

64
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,820
结果呢  我快急死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So? I'm dying here.

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,350
你告诉他你知道他出轨后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How did he react when you told him

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,530
他作何反应
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you knew that he was cheating on you?

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,510
这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well,

68
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,770
我们的对话发展方向出人意料
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the conversation went in a surprising direction.

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,550
你说了什么  你说了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You said what? You said what?

70
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,210
什么  你怎么能那么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What? How could you say that?

71
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,710
你怎么能那么说  贝丝·安
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How could you say that, Beth Ann?

72
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,210
你在想什么  你在想什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you thinking? What are you thinking?

73
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,650
我不敢相信你那么说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't even believe you just said that!

74
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,060
赶紧回来  我好跟你说清楚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Get back here so I can give it to you!

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,510
都怪你妈妈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's your mother's fault.

76
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,890
显然  她忘了教你一些基本原则
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Clearly, she forgot to teach you some of the basics.

77
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,210
比如长大后  别假装患有癌症
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Things like, when you grow up, don't pretend to have cancer.

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,270
女人每天都会骗她们的丈夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Women lie to their husbands every day.

79
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,400
有的会在花了多少钱上面撒谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Some lie about how much they spend.

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,220
而我的谎言是我要死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My lie's that I'm dying.

81
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,140
就因为你一副高雅的样子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just because you act classy

82
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,880
不代表你没疯掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}doesn't mean you're not fucking crazy.

83
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,930
我的疯癫不是没有目的的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There is a method to my madness.

84
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,430
罗伯绝不会在我生病时离开我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob will never leave me while I'm sick.

85
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,580
可万一艾普尔决定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But what if April decides

86
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,160
告诉他她怀上了他的孩子呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to tell him that she's having his kid?

87
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,370
这个时候她的好朋友希拉就要登场了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That is where her good friend Sheila comes in.

88
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,380
我会劝她离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm going to convince her to leave town.

89
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,930
开始新生活  彻底斩断和他的关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Start a new life, sever the tie for good.

90
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,500
然后  等她出局后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And then, once she's out of the picture

91
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,930
罗伯就会属于我一个人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I have Rob all to myself,

92
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,940
我的癌症也会奇迹般痊愈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}my cancer will be miraculously cured.

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
我以前觉得你的微笑迷人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I used to find that little grin charming.

94
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,340
现在快吓死我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now it just scares the shit out of me.

95
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,350
女士们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ladies.

96
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,030
你们可以进去看医生了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The doctor will see you now.

97
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,940
恩佐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Enzo.

98
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,810
希拉姑妈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aunt Sheila.

99
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,840
瞧瞧穿白大褂的你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look at you in the white coat.

100
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,670
这是我邻居  贝丝·安·斯坦顿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is my neighbor, Beth Ann Stanton.

101
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,890
贝丝·安  我侄子恩佐  我给你说的医生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Beth Ann, my nephew, Enzo. The doctor.

102
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,150
幸会  斯坦顿夫人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nice to meet you, Mrs. Stanton.

103
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,320
我也是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Likewise.

104
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,740
希拉说你是学肿瘤学的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, Sheila says you studied oncology.

105
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,560
就学了一段时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For a little while,

106
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,770
-然后我就转去血液学了  -不过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- and then I switched to hematology. - Oh, still,

107
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,020
你肯定还记得很多有用的信息吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I bet you remember lots of useful tidbits.

108
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
也许  有什么需要帮助的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I suppose so. How can I help you?

109
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,170
我在想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I was wondering

110
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,490
你能不能推荐一种癌症
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if there was a cancer you could recommend.

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,250
-推荐  -比较罕见的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Recommend? - Something rare.

112
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,630
常人从未听说过的癌症
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That no one's ever heard of.

113
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,770
要很严重
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It should be serious.

114
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,710
但偶尔也可治愈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, but occasionally curable.

115
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,480
我不太懂...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry...

116
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,690
还有病症  她需要了解一些症状
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And symptoms. She's gonna need symptoms.

117
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,130
如果能提供一些症状  那就太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, some symptoms would be lovely.

118
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,570
等一...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just wait a...

119
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,000
我们到底在说什么啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What exactly are we talking about here?

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
恩佐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Enzo.

121
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,230
我作为你姑妈及一位西西里人跟你讲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I say this to you as your aunt and a Sicilian:

122
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,150
你知道的越少越好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The less you know, the better.

123
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,180
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

124
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,210
罕见的癌症
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, rare cancers.

125
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,350
不如...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What about...

126
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,920
上皮样血管内皮细胞瘤
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.

127
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,170
再说一遍
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Say that again.

128
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,970
不用了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd rather not.

129
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,870
你得的就是这种癌吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's the cancer you have?

130
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,260
它会影响软组织
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It affects soft tissue.

131
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,890
我想跟你细说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'd give you the details,

132
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,690
但是细节太恶心了  我们还要吃芝士火锅呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but they're disgusting and we're having fondue.

133
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,450
天  你应该让我陪你去看医生的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}God, I wish you'd let me go to the doctor's with you.

134
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,300
你总是容易激动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You always get so emotional.

135
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,710
不  还是希拉陪我一起去比较好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. I prefer to go with Sheila.

136
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,090
我要去摆餐具了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, I'm going to set the table.

137
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,210
慢着  起码告诉我你还能活多久
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wait. Wait. At least tell me your prognosis.

138
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,400
我会的  但是我不想败坏晚餐兴致
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will, but I don't want to ruin our meal.

139
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,730
贝丝·安  求你了  告诉我吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Beth Ann! Please, just tell me!

140
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,190
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fine.

141
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,720
但我需要你坚强
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I need you to be strong.

142
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,120
你做得到吗  罗伯特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can you do that for me, Robert?

143
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,250
你能做我的勇敢大男孩吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can you be my brave boy?

144
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,770
我可以的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

145
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,770
看起来我只剩六个月的时间了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it seems I only have six months to live.

146
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,990
六个月
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Six months!

147
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,590
但那不代表我就没有治愈的可能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But that doesn't mean I can't recover.

148
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,870
奇迹每天都在发生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miracles happen every day.

149
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,070
但是医生说我们应该为最坏情况做打算
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But the doctor feels we should prepare for the worst.

150
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,470
听起来他已经不抱希望了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It sounds like he's giving up already.

151
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,070
我们应该换个医生再诊断看看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We should get a second opinion.

152
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,960
不用  就算换个医生又能说什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. I mean, what is another doctor going to say?

153
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,450
说我没得癌症吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't have cancer?

154
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,880
木已成舟  我们必须接受
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, this is the situation, and we all must accept it.

155
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,060
好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay?

156
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,580
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

157
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,740
显然  如果我要对抗癌症
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, obviously, if I'm going to fight this thing,

158
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,260
我需要你的陪伴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need you by my side.

159
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,530
寸步不离
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Constantly.

160
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,480
我哪儿都不会去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not going anywhere.

161
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,730
你是我妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're my wife.

162
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,780
当我说"至死不渝"时  我是认真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I meant it when I said, "Till death do us part."

163
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,460
我的心肝宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my darling.

164
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,020
你可要说话算数
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm going to hold you to that.

165
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,130
这太难选了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is hard.

166
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,270
我从没为三个月的旅行打包过行李
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've never packed for a three-month trip before.

167
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,200
打包三个月的行李太容易了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, packing for three months is easy.

168
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,480
我每周末外出都装这么多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do it every time I go away for the weekend.

169
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,710
这裤子看起来很结实  要不我试下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}These look sturdy. Should I try them on?

170
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,920
去试吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Knock yourself out.

171
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,100
我知道我们说好了你晚我一周飞抵巴黎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, I know we agreed that you'd fly to Paris a week after me,

172
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,970
但是三天难道还不够打掩护吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but wouldn't three days be enough?

173
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,480
或是两天呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or even two?

174
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,240
你连一周都等不了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't wait one week?

175
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,450
我们要争分夺秒地做爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We need as much time for sex as possible.

176
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,060
记着  你说过我们要把爱"做"遍欧洲每一座城市
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Remember, you said you'd make love to me in every city in Europe.

177
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,100
我一人待一整周要怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What am I supposed to do on my own for a whole week?

178
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,050
用手做[走开]
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Beat it.

179
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,870
那可真冷血
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's cold.

180
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,230
我不是说你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, not you.

181
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,170
你觉得如何  喜欢这裤子吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you think? Do you like them?

182
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,130
要这么多口袋何用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, what are all the pockets for?

183
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,280
装东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Carrying stuff.

184
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,250
徒步攀登阿尔卑斯山时会很有用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They'll be great for hiking over the Alps.

185
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,170
-徒步攀登阿尔卑斯山  -对啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hiking over the Alps? - Yeah.

186
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,070
我的天  我们是去度假还是去逃离纳粹分子呐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Good Lord, are we taking a vacation or fleeing the Nazis?

187
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,160
我才意识到我们想象的旅行好像很不一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm starting to think that we're imagining very different trips.

188
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,480
我们的假期应该是优雅  浪漫的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I want our vacation to be elegant, romantic.

189
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,800
在法兰西剧院看戏的夜晚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nights at la Comédie-Française,

190
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,850
在马克西姆餐厅享用晚餐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}dinner at Maxim's.

191
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,320
可是这些都太贵了  我付不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, well, I can't afford those things.

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,980
如果你付不起的话...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, well, if that's the problem...

193
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,800
不行  我知道你付得起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I know you can afford those things,

194
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,070
但是我不想当你的小白脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I-I don't want to feel like your gigolo.

195
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,450
-我有个主意  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I have an idea. - What?

196
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,420
把我的胸针退回去  把钱拿回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Return my brooch and get your money back.

197
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,470
这钱能买不少法式蜗牛呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What you spent on it can buy a whole lot of escargot.

198
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,530
我为你买这胸针是为了向你证明你对我多重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I bought you this to show you what you mean to me.

199
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,610
那就换种方式证明给我看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, find another way to show me.

200
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,600
怎么证明
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Like what?

201
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,660
你是个艺术家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're an artist.

202
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,170
发挥你的想象力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Use your imagination.

203
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,690

204
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,090
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

205
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,070
我们拭目以待
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll see what I can come up with.

206
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,220
泰勒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor.

207
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,660
你怎么在这儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you doing here?

208
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,780
我们能谈谈吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can we talk for a sec?

209
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,740
我十岁时  我母亲生了重病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My mom got sick when I was ten.

210
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,840
从那时起  只剩我们姊妹相依为命
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}From that point on, it was just us,

211
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,120
我不得不扛起重任
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so I had to step up.

212
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,130
那样也好  因为我学会了掌控局面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But it was good, because I learned to take charge.

213
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,110
我发觉无论面临任何问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I found out I could figure out the solution

214
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,000
我都可以找到解决办法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to any problem that came my way.

215
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,020
直到昨晚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Until last night.

216
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,970
我在酒店房间一直坐到天明
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I sat in that hotel room until dawn

217
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,840
想着要如何化解与伊莱的僵局
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}trying to figure out how to fix this thing with Eli.

218
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,800
可我想不出办法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I just can't.

219
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,240
我很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm so sorry.

220
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,840
当伊莱上次嗑药过量时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, when Eli O.D.'d last time,

221
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,510
我很清楚要如何做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I knew exactly what to do.

222
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,410
我送他去戒毒所  偿还了他的债务
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I got him into rehab, I paid off his debts.

223
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,710
但我觉得他始终有些怨恨我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I think that a part of him always resented me

224
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,770
恨我用了一种他做不到的方式掌控了大局
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}for managing the situation in a way that he couldn't.

225
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,600
现在他十分生我的气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And now he's just so angry at me.

226
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,110
我觉得他不会允许我帮他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I don't think he'll let me help him.

227
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,600
我很害怕如果我不帮他  以后会出什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I'm so scared of what will happen if I can't.

228
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,000
伊莱又不会死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli is not going to die.

229
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,750
他如果继续吸毒  一定会死的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He will if he doesn't stop using.

230
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,640
但好消息是  他依然听你的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But the good news is he still listens to you.

231
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,390
所以我求求你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I am begging you. Please.

232
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,620
你是我最后的希望
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are my last hope.

233
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,300
当然可以了  绝对没问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course, yes. Totally.

234
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,750
我完全是站在你这边的  我保证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm totally with you. I promise.

235
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,960
谢天谢地  你不知道这对我意义有多重大
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank God. You have no idea how much that means to me.

236
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,070
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

237
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,610
我们必须快速行动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We have to move fast,

238
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,170
要赶在伊莱的剧本稿费到账前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}before the money comes in for Eli's script.

239
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,240
你是担心他会把那些钱都用来买毒品吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're worried he's gonna spend it all on drugs?

240
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,430
不仅仅是毒品
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not just drugs.

241
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,810
伊莱一旦开始吸毒  出手就阔绰到傻的地步
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When Eli's using, he gets stupid generous.

242
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,480
-阔绰到傻的地步  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Stupid generous? - Oh, yeah.

243
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,230
上一次  他给每个人都买了礼物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The last time, he bought gifts for everyone.

244
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,650
劳力士手表  设计师名牌鞋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rolex watches, designer shoes.

245
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,090
他嗑嗨了以后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When he's high,

246
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,870
就希望所有人都跟他一样开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he just wants everyone to be as happy as he is.

247
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,320
所以  我一直在想办法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, I've been thinking of ways

248
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,490
能让我们隐秘地进行这个计划
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that we can handle this covertly.

249
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,540
我有个主意  但有点疯狂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I have one idea, but it... it's kind of crazy.

250
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,200
我喜欢疯狂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I like crazy.

251
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,800
伊莱下次洗澡时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The next time Eli's in the shower,

252
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,170
我需要你打开他的手机  查出他所有的密码
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need you to go into his phone and find all of his passwords.

253
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,240
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

254
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,410
他的手机解锁密码是0429
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The code to his phone is 0-4-2-9.

255
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,750
给  我替你写下来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just here, look, I wrote it down for you.

256
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,040
如果我们能进入
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If we can get access

257
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,080
他的商务账户和信用卡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to his his business accounts and his credit cards,

258
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,670
就能切断他的现金流
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we can cut off his cash flow.

259
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,150
并且我还会联系他父亲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I'm gonna call his dad.

260
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,260
那能有什么帮助
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How will that help?

261
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,770
伊莱超级怕他父亲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli is terrified of his dad.

262
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,960
杰克会逼他承认是谁让他又复吸了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jake will force him to admit who got him using again.

263
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,050
那有什么重要的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why does that matter?

264
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,650
他成功戒毒两年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was clean for two years,

265
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,980
突然间却又开始吸上了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and then suddenly he's not?

266
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,960
不  我需要知道究竟是怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I need to know what happened.

267
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,670
当然了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course.

268
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,860
我也想帮忙  但这真的是最好的计划吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I want to help, but is this really the best plan?

269
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,600
你这是什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you mean?

270
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,380
你还记得你之前觉得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, you remember how you felt when you thought

271
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,870
我和伊莱在合伙对付你  你是什么感觉吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that Eli and I were ganging up on you.

272
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,650
如果他觉得我们两个合起伙来对付他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How is he gonna feel if it... if it seems like

273
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,560
他又会是什么感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we're ganging up on him?

274
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,370
那你建议我们该怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So what do you propose we do?

275
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,660
给我几天时间  我会跟他讲道理  说服他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give me a few days and I'll reason with him.

276
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,710
你真的觉得你有能力说服他吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You really think you can talk him into this?

277
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,460
相信我  我会说服他的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Trust me. I'll get through to him,

278
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,280
他会回到家中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he'll come home,

279
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,770
我们又可以成为一家人了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and we'll all be a family again.

280
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,240
瞧瞧这是谁来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look who's here!

281
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,760
卡尔  这是希特维尔夫妇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl, it's the Sitwells!

282
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,420
你们从苏格兰回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're back from Scotland, I see.

283
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,490
我们还要跟雷克斯和朱莉一起享用晚餐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And we're meeting Rex and Julie for dinner.

284
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,750
他们应该随时都有可能到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They should be here any second.

285
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,970
我爱她  她觉得我很美
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I love her. She thinks I'm pretty.

286
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,670
我们都觉得你很美
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We all think you're pretty.

287
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,500
但她会大声说出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But she says it out loud.

288
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,420
这样吧  等他们到了以后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell you what... when they get here,

289
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,010
不如你把他们带去我们那桌吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}why don't you bring them over to our table?

290
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,090
我们一起用餐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We'll dine together.

291
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,580
好极了  那你们就可以跟我们说说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wonderful. Then you can tell us

292
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,140
你们对于艾米的奢华婚礼的安排了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}about your plans for Amy's lavish wedding.

293
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,720
我们太激动了  简直迫不及待
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're so excited. We can't wait.

294
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,670
我也迫不及待
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't wait, either.

295
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,070
迫不及待让婚礼早点结束
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For it to be over.

296
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,690
是啊  我也是同样的想法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, I was thinking the same thing.

297
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,200
我们是很糟糕的人吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oof, are we terrible people?

298
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,050
才不是  婚礼是很累人的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. Weddings are exhausting.

299
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,590
再说了  我们得节省精力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Besides, we need to conserve our energy

300
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,930
用来陪我们的男性情人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}for our male lovers.

301
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,820
至少你的情人没有比新郎更年轻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At least yours isn't younger than the groom.

302
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,780
是啊  我觉得新娘的继父
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, I think the, uh, stepfather of the bride

303
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,830
至少该找一个与他年龄相当的男友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}should have at least an age-appropriate boyfriend.

304
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,280
就当我老传统吧  但我就是这么想的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Call me old fashioned, but I just do.

305
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,420
卡尔  你脸上这是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Karl. What's that on your face?

306
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,430
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

307
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,670
天呐  你化了妆吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God, are you wearing makeup?

308
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,270
没你的妆浓
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Less than you.

309
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,900
你真是彻底放飞自我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You really are spreading your wings.

310
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,170
我觉得我出国的时机刚刚好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think I'm leaving the country in the nick of time.

311
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,200
-我去洗手间了  -我给你叫一杯螺丝锥鸡尾酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'm off to the ladies' room - I'll order you a gimlet.

312
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,390
萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone?

313
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,090
嗨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hi.

314
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,330
你是本奈特医生的妻子  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, you are Dr. Bennett's wife, right?

315
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,840
我叫莫琳  同时我也在他的诊所当护士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maureen. I also work in his practice as a nurse.

316
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,530
那可真好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, isn't that nice?

317
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,840
我真的有点难以启齿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know quite how to say this.

318
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,920
但是   你知道你丈夫是同性恋吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But... do you know your husband's a homosexual?

319
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,150
是的  我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, I know.

320
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,900
你这不说得挺直接的嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you said it just fine.

321
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,890
我知道这不关我的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I realize it's none of my business.

322
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,750
我只是想当个好人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm just trying to be a good person.

323
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,060
跟所有好人一样  你就是迫不及待地告诉我这事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And like all good people, you just couldn't wait to tell me.

324
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,260
我要走了  你尽情地补妆吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm going now. Feel free to adjust your halo.

325
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,250
卡尔跟你说了他病了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Has Karl told you he's sick?

326
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,370
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

327
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,980
看来还没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can see he hasn't.

328
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,200
卡尔才没病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl isn't sick.

329
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,630
他三天前去我丈夫那里就诊了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He saw my husband three days ago.

330
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,780
他也患上了在同性恋男子群体中肆虐的那种疾病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He has that new disease that all the gay men are spreading.

331
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,710
你在说谎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's a lie.

332
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,360
他是我丈夫见过的第三位患者
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's the third man my husband's seen who's had it.

333
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,930
前两个都已经死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The first two are dead.

334
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,160
我很遗憾  我只是觉得你应该知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm so sorry. I just thought you should know.

335
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,210
我懂  我懂  我懂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know, I know, I know,

336
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,070
我知道这听起来难以置信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know, I know it sounds unbelievable

337
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,230
并且很荒唐  但麻烦稍微忍耐下..
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and faintly ridiculous, but bear with me on this...

338
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,440
你好啊  亲爱的  你来的正是时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, hello, darling. It's perfect timing.

339
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,840
我正在跟大家说我们的威尼斯之旅呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was just telling everyone the story of our trip to Venice,

340
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,020
你不小心把那个船夫撞进水里了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}when you accidentally knocked that gondolier into the water.

341
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,950
这事是真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now, did that really happen?

342
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,260
还是卡尔在瞎说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or is Karl just embellishing?

343
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,840
没有  那种事情卡尔不会撒谎的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, that-that's not the kind of thing Karl would lie about.

344
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,080
然后他浑身湿漉漉的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, there he was, dripping wet,

345
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,980
肚子里装满了威尼斯大运河的水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}hacking up great lungfuls of the Grand Canal,

346
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,110
我意识到一个人想保持体面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I realized it's very difficult

347
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,790
是一件很难的事情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to maintain one's dignity...

348
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,800
-嗨  早上你到哪里去了  -出去了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hey. Where have you been all morning? - Ah... out.

349
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,440
做事情  准确说是做好事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Doing stuff. Doing great stuff, in fact.

350
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,130
跟我到外面来  我有东西要给你看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come with me outside. I've got something to show you.

351
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,270
-来吧  -你昨晚都没上床
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Come on. - You never came to bed last night.

352
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,640
你有睡觉吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you get any sleep at all?

353
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,280
没有  我发现不停吸食可卡因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. No, it turns out one of the side effects

354
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,330
有一点副作用就是  人会有点失眠
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}of near-constant cocaine use is a wee bit of insomnia.

355
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,360
来吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on.

356
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,110
-哇  -看到了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh! Wow! - Right?

357
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,510
你喜欢吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You like it?

358
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,570
-这个  是你买的吗  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- It... uh... you bought this? - I did.

359
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,760
准确地说是美国运通信用卡买的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, uh, technically American Express bought it.

360
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,780
但是我的稿酬一进账
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But that bill's gonna get paid

361
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,930
我就会用那笔钱偿付
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the second my first script payment comes through.

362
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,280
你喜欢吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You like it?

363
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,470
听着  我知道你最近非常辛苦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, I know you've been working really hard,

364
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,480
我也明白你想奖赏自己
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I get that you'd want to treat yourself...

365
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,850
自己  不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Me? No. Whoa.

366
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,900
不  不是的  这不是给我买的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I didn't... This isn't for me.

367
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,890
你给我买了一辆车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Y-You bought me a car?

368
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,870
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I did.

369
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,370
-不会吧  -不骗你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Shut. Up. - I won't.

370
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,390
这是我对你的感谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is me saying thank you.

371
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,580
-为了什么  -天哪  为了一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- For what? - My God, for everything.

372
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,500
为了你在剧本上给予我的帮助
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For all the help you gave me with the script.

373
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,130
为了你在泰勒发疯时  对我的支持
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For standing by me when Taylor lost her mind...

374
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,650
天哪  泰勒不会高兴的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, God... Taylor's not gonna like this.

375
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,530
你知道吗  这件事泰勒无权插手  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, you know what? Taylor doesn't get a vote, okay?

376
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,740
看起来很贵  你确定吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It looks expensive. Are you sure?

377
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,430
我给你承诺过  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I made you a promise, right?

378
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,290
我说过等钱进账了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I said when this money came through,

379
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,530
我会照顾你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I would take care of you.

380
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,530
我生活中有很多人给我许下过承诺
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}People have made me a lot of promises in my life.

381
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,410
但之前都没人能够遵守
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nobody's ever kept one before.

382
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,650
这是我兑现我的承诺
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, this is me keeping mine.

383
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,970
而这仅仅是开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And this is just the beginning.

384
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,080
那么...你喜欢吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So... do you like it?

385
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,600
太棒了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's perfect.

386
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,020
一直向前面直走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just keep going straight.

387
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,700
我做了点功课
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I've been doing some research,

388
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,270
找了些孕妇可以做的工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}finding jobs a pregnant woman can do.

389
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,430
我已经有工作了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I already have a job.

390
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,140
要生产的女人不该做整天站着的工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You shouldn't be on your feet all day when you're expecting,

391
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,320
不过别担心  对于你这样情况的女孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but don't worry. There are plenty of ways

392
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,620
还是有很多方法谋生的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}a girl in your condition can make a living.

393
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,950
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are there?

394
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,460
当然了  你可以去保龄球馆做保龄球摆放员
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sure. You could be a pin setter in a bowling alley.

395
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,670
你只需要按按钮就行了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All you'd have to do is punch buttons.

396
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,010
我看到阿纳海姆的一家保龄球馆在招人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I found an opening at an alley in Anaheim.

397
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,830
现在左转
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now take a left.

398
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,650
或者还有个地方在招接线员
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or... there's a place hiring switchboard operators.

399
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,120
不过那份工作你得搬去巴斯托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For that, you'd have to move to Barstow.

400
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,270
听上去你好像想甩掉我似的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It sounds like you're trying to get rid of me.

401
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,780
别傻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be silly.

402
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,040
我只是觉得在新的城市里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just thought it might be easier for you

403
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,150
你能够更容易有个好的开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to make a fresh start in a new city.

404
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,050
-我不会搬走的  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Well, I'm not moving. - Okay.

405
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,930
记住我会在你身边
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just know I'm here for you.

406
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,350
为你提供一切所需
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For anything you need.

407
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,310
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

408
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,970
停车吧  到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh... uh, pull over, this is it.

409
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,740
你弄错了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This must be a mistake.

410
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,890
医生才不会把诊所开在这种地方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A doctor wouldn't have his office in here.

411
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,160
不  就是这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, this is it.

412
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,060
你确定你把地址记对了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you sure you have the address right?

413
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,340
希拉  我骗了你  我不是来见医生的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila, I lied. I'm not here to see a doctor.

414
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,790
我不明白
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't understand.

415
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,160
抱歉  我不能要这个孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry. I just can't have this baby.

416
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,860
你到底在说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you talking about?

417
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,160
请别让我大声说出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please do not make me say this out loud.

418
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,120
你要干的这件事  是不合法的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What you're going to do, it's illegal.

419
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,340
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know.

420
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,180
天哪  你到底是从哪里听来的这个地方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}God, how did you even hear about this place?

421
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,060
餐馆的一个女孩推荐我来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A girl at the diner referred me.

422
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,740
你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You...

423
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,730
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Excuse me.

424
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,910
你不能这么做  这是不对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't do this, it's not right.

425
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,970
希拉  请别再给我增添负担了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila, please do not make this harder than it already is.

426
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,970
我是萨利·琼斯  我们通过电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm Sally Jones. We spoke on the phone.

427
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
她是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who's she?

428
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,600
我的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My friend.

429
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,390
做完她要载我回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She'll drive me home afterwards.

430
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,260
-带钱了吗  -带了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You got the money? - I do.

431
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,510
进来吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on in.

432
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,870
希拉  拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila. Please.

433
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,140
我现在比任何时候都需要朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I really need a friend right now, more than ever.

434
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,540
-给你  孩子  -谢谢你  先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Here you go, son. - Thank you, sir.

435
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,450
我马上为您把车开过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll have your car here in just a second.

436
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,180
-美好的一晚  -见到你们太开心了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Terrific night. - Lovely seeing you all.

437
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,280
我们隔几天再聚一次吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's do it again very soon.

438
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,240
晚安  萨蒙妮  婚礼再见吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Good night, Simone. See you at the wedding.

439
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,400
好了  现在没人了  你可以说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, we're alone. You can tell me now.

440
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,410
说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell you what?

441
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,130
我又怎么惹你了  别说你没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How I've upset you. And don't say you're fine.

442
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,770
整晚上你就没跟我说几句话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've barely said two words to me the entire evening.

443
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,220
等到车里再说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wait till we're in the car.

444
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
能不能给点提示
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can I at least have a headline?

445
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,130
我在洗手间撞上你医生的妻子了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I ran into your doctor's wife in the ladies' room.

446
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,370
我不记得有见过她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't think I've ever met her.

447
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,320
她也是名护士
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She also works as a nurse.

448
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,960
在他诊所里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In his office.

449
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,900
她说了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What did she say?

450
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,680
你生病了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're sick.

451
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,200
我说两件事  第一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, two things: first of all...

452
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,420
我没病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not sick.

453
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,890
第二  她真是个八婆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Secondly, what a gossipy bitch.

454
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,470
-你是说她撒谎了吗  -我没有症状
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Are you saying she lied? - I'm not... symptomatic.

455
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,680
-我觉得没事  -那你化妆是在掩藏什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I feel fine. - So what's the makeup hiding?

456
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
一个脓疱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A spot.

457
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,470
-你是说病变吗  -拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Don't you mean a lesion? - Oh, come on,

458
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,660
那很小
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}it's miniscule.

459
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,870
你知道我有多害怕吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you have any idea how scared I am?

460
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,860
-你没有感染  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You don't have it. - What?

461
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,330
事实是  这病只能通过血液
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, the fact is, it can only be transmitted through blood

462
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,200
或者体液传播  我们很少有性生活
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}or bodily fluids, and we rarely had sex,

463
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,870
就算有也都是戴了套的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and never without a condom.

464
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,690
你是这么想的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is that what you think?

465
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,700
-我是在为自己担心  -亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- That I'm scared for myself? - Darling, darling, darling,

466
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,970
我  我应该告诉你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I, I, I... I should have told you,

467
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,410
亲爱的  我只是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}my love, I just...

468
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,190
我  我不想破坏了你的旅行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I did... I just didn't want to spoil your trip.

469
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,950
天  旅行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, God, the trip.

470
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,290
我很抱歉  我保证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, I'm so sorry. I-I-I-I promise

471
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,840
你走期间我会每周给你打一次电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I... I-I will call once a week while you're away,

472
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,780
告诉你病情的最新进展
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with, with full medical updates.

473
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,410
你觉得我还会去吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think I'm still going?

474
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,790
在这种时候离开你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That I'd leave you at a time like this?

475
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,750
你留下来又能改变什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And what would staying achieve?

476
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,610
除了让我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Other than letting me know

477
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,290
你觉得我挺不过劳工节
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that you think I won't make it past Labor Day?

478
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,510
你需要关照  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You need care, Karl.

479
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,040
专家  而且得找个妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Specialists. And at least one doctor whose wife

480
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,920
不是大嘴巴的医生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}is not the goddamn town crier!

481
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,860
我知道汤米对你有多重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know how much Tommy means to you.

482
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,450
我要留下来陪你  没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm staying with you, and that is the end

483
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,400
商量的余地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}of this discussion.

484
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,110
谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

485
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,730
-你想喝点威士忌吗  -威士忌
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Do you want some whiskey? - Whiskey?

486
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,620
在你开始前喝醉对你有好处
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's good to get a little drunk before you start.

487
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,190
能缓解疼痛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Helps with the pain.

488
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,230
-不了  谢谢  -随你便
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- No, thank you. - Suit yourself.

489
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,000
给我几分钟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just give me a couple of minutes.

490
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,410
我得在桌上铺点塑料
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I got to get some plastic over the table.

491
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,420
她要在厨房里做吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's doing this in the kitchen?

492
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,270
显然是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Apparently.

493
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,750
可这是侵入性操作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But it's an invasive procedure.

494
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,820
需要干净的环境  消毒器械
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It requires a clean environment. Sterilized instruments.

495
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,440
我只能负担起这个了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, this is all I can afford.

496
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,820
我无计可施了  希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm out of options, Sheila.

497
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,500
请理解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please understand.

498
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,770
有件事你不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's something you don't know.

499
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,610
我得告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's something I need to tell you.

500
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,930
什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's that?

501
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,230
我曾有个孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I had a child once,

502
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,040
但她过世了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but she died.

503
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,940
我没有关上后院的大门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I left the gate to the backyard open.

504
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,350
她漫步到了街上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She wandered out into the street

505
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,640
被车撞了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and she was hit by a car.

506
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,340
已经过去了很多年  但我每天都在想她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's been years, but I think about her every day.

507
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,940
有时在深夜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sometimes, late at night,

508
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,990
我会想要是她还活着  她会长成一个怎样的女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wonder what kind of young woman she'd have turned into.

509
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,630
你怎么能在此时此刻跟我说这种事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How could you tell me something like that right now?

510
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,280
你想要我感到内疚吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you... are you trying to make me feel guilty?

511
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,120
不  你不明白
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, you don't understand.

512
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,190
不  不明白的是你  希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I think you don't understand, Sheila.

513
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,570
-我必须这么做  -亲爱的  我想说的是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I have to do this. - Honey, I'm trying to say...

514
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,670
我想我女儿长大后会很像你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think my daughter would have grown up to be a lot like you.

515
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,030
这也是我爱你的原因之一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That is one of the reasons I love you.

516
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,090
但现在我为你担心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But right now I'm afraid for you

517
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,200
因为女人会在这样的地方死去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because women die in places like this.

518
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,410
我不能允许这样的事发生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't let that happen.

519
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,100
希拉  我单身还没钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila, I'm single and I'm broke.

520
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,900
我没能力抚养小孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't raise a baby.

521
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,290
我们会想出办法的  我们只是需要时间思考
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We'll figure it out. We just need time to think.

522
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,760
-让我帮你  -怎么帮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Let me help you. - How?

523
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,160
我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I'll...

524
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,790
我会  我会去筹一些钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll get some... I'll get my hands on some money.

525
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,600
我们可以去别的地方  一个安全的地方  但是拜托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We can go somewhere else, somewhere safe, but please,

526
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,100
离开这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}let's get out of here.

527
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,880
好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay. Okay.

528
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,260
喂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

529
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,620
我就是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, this is she.

530
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,940
没  我的美国运通信用卡没丢  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I haven't lost my Amex. Why?

531
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,760
可疑活动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Suspicious activity?

532
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,760
花了多少钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, how much was spent?

533
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,740
车子不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nice car.

534
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,180
泰勒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor.

535
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,400
-你刚从家里出来吗  -我是来找伊莱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Were you in the house? - I came to talk to Eli

536
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,990
好让他给我解释为什么我的信用卡被刷爆了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so he could explain to me why my credit card is maxed out,

537
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,370
然后我看到你停下这辆崭新的车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and then I saw you pull up in this brand-new car.

538
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,980
我不知道他什么时候回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I-I don't know when he'll be home.

539
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,330
他要在派拉蒙参加一个会议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He has a meeting at Paramount and...

540
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,040
这是他买给你的  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He bought it for you, didn't he?

541
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,280
我跟他说了这太贵重
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I told him it was too much.

542
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,840
-什么时候  -他给我的那一刻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- When? - The moment he gave it to me.

543
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,400
不  我是问他什么时候给你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. I'm asking when did he give it to you?

544
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,960
在我今早在公园里看到你之前还是之后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Before I saw you in the park this morning or after?

545
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,350
之后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}After.

546
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,720
那你怎么没坚持退回去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So why didn't you insist he take it back?

547
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,750
我很意外  我不知道该说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was so surprised, I didn't know what to say.

548
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,680
意外  洁德  我刚跟你说了伊莱嗨了以后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Surprised? Jade, I had just told you that when Eli is high,

549
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,050
-他就会乱花钱  -我不认为这是乱花钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- he's stupid with money. - Well, I don't think it's stupid.

550
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,070
我每天要做饭  打扫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I spend every day cooking and cleaning,

551
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,440
跑腿  照顾你俩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}running errands and looking after you both.

552
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,710
我觉得这很好  终于有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think it's nice that someone actually

553
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,390
想说谢谢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}wanted to say thank you.

554
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,120
你想有人谢谢你  行  洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You want a thank you? Okay, fine, Jade.

555
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,240
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

556
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,570
钥匙给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now give me the keys.

557
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,730
-为什么  -因为我要把车退回去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Why? - 'Cause I'm gonna return the car, obviously.

558
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,720
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

559
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,770
-你这是什么啥意思  -你不能把车退掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What do you mean no? - You can't return the car.

560
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,190
车不是你的  是伊莱买给我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not yours. Eli bought it for me.

561
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,670
但他是因为嗑药嗑疯了才买的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, but he's coked out of his mind.

562
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,430
接受一个这种情况下男人送的礼物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}To accept a gift from a man in that condition

563
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,540
"吃相"可不太好看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}is not a good look.

564
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,410
天  你为什么这样子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My God. Why are you acting like this?

565
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,950
我没有做过任何错事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I haven't done anything wrong.

566
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,920
你是在趁人之危
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are taking advantage of this situation.

567
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,520
你在利用伊莱  钥匙给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're using Eli. Just give me the keys.

568
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,540
够了  要说谁是使用者[瘾君子]的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop it. If anyone is a user,

569
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,870
那也是你  泰勒  你利用了我好几个月了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor, it's you. You have been using me for months.

570
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,630
我救了你  我让你住进我家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I saved you. I brought you into my home.

571
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,980
你那是为了你自己  不是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You did that for yourself, not for me.

572
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,260
你的婚姻分崩离析  你需要一个分心的事物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your marriage was falling apart and you needed a distraction.

573
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,360
伊莱写不出剧本  赚不到钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli wasn't writing or making money,

574
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,450
你很生气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you were so angry

575
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,320
你几乎都不正眼看他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you could barely even look at him.

576
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,780
对了  是我让他再次开始写作的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}By the way, I'm the one who got him writing again.

577
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,920
我是为了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I did that for you.

578
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,560
不用谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're welcome.

579
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,920
我一直在想为什么伊莱复吸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I keep wondering why Eli started using again.

580
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,850
是因为你IMA
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you the reason?

581
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,030
天呐  我们不该这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God. We shouldn't be doing this.

582
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,640
吵架  互相责备
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fighting and throwing blame at each other.

583
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,530
我们应该是一家人的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're supposed to be a family.

584
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,750
够了  够了  洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop it. Stop it, Jade!

585
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,000
我和伊莱是一家人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli and I are a family.

586
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,040
你是房客
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are a houseguest.

587
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,230
仅此而已
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's all.

588
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,650
知道吗  洁德  上楼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know what, Jade? Go upstairs,

589
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,560
收拾你的东西  我要你立刻离开我家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}get your stuff. I want you out of my house now!

590
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,370
想得美
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's not gonna happen.

591
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,520
你要想的话你可以再次离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can leave again if you want,

592
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,110
我反正是不会走的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I'm not going anywhere,

593
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,770
而且我要把车留下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I'm keeping the car.

594
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,540
我不会让你把它夺走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not gonna let you take it away from me.

595
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,560
汤米  进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy, come in.

596
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,120
嗨  我有好消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hi. I have great news.

597
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,860
我把你的胸针退掉了  我给你买了替代礼品
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I returned your brooch and I got your replacement gift.

598
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,930
不是传统意义上的礼物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it's not a traditional gift

599
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,650
只是对你表达敬意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so much as a tribute to you.

600
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,850
我希望你喜欢  因为
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I sure hope you like it because, uh,

601
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,890
我不能退掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't really return it.

602
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,010
你看着不开心  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey. You look sad. What's wrong?

603
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,450
我们得谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We need to talk.

604
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,840
好消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey. Hey, great news.

605
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,900
派拉蒙想让我改编一本小说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Paramount wants to talk to me about adapting a novel.

606
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,740
我周五要去开会  我跟你说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I got a meeting on Friday. I'm telling you,

607
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,080
我是真的要东山再起了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}this comeback shit is really starting to get real.

608
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,270
我真的为你感到开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm really, really happy for you.

609
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,370
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's wrong?

610
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,810
泰勒之前来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor stopped by.

611
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,520
我猜你们的见面不是很和谐  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm guessing that didn't go so well, huh?

612
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,000
伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Eli.

613
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,610
我讨厌这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hate this.

614
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,880
我讨厌她让我陷入这种境地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hate that she's putting me in this position.

615
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,290
什么境地  你在说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What position? What are you talking about?

616
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,750
她想让我搞到你账户的密码
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She wants me to get the passwords to your accounts,

617
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,880
这样她就能拿走你所有的钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so she can take away all your money.

618
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,250
取消旅行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Cancel the trip?

619
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,440
我不能在卡尔生病时离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't leave when Karl is sick.

620
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,840
可他都没有住院
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, but-but he's not even in the hospital.

621
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,400
暂时还没  但这个病无法预测
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not yet, but this disease is unpredictable.

622
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,100
我得留下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to be here.

623
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,260
不  这不公平  这本应是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, that's not fair. This was supposed to be

624
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,710
我这辈子最棒的一个夏天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the best summer of my life.

625
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,950
这也可能是卡尔一生里最后一个夏天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And this could be the last summer of Karl's life,

626
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,990
所以拜托别生气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so please stop sulking.

627
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,730
-你在干什么  -我要喝酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What are you doing? - I need a drink.

628
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,960
你才刚满18岁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're barely 18.

629
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,180
嗯  跟你交往让我成熟了很多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, well, dating you has aged me.

630
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,550
给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give me that.

631
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,830
一周  这是我唯一要求
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}One week, that's all I ask.

632
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,550
一周时间不会发生任何事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nothing can happen in-in a-a week.

633
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,990
那有什么意义  我不会开心的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What would be the point? I wouldn't enjoy myself.

634
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,970
跟我一起去巴黎都不开心吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In Paris? With me?

635
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,720
我丈夫要死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My husband is dying.

636
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,210
你不明白这意味着什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can you not understand what that means?

637
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,770
那我们的关系会怎样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So what's gonna happen to us?

638
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,020
我想"我们"是成不了的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't think there can be an "Us."

639
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,920
听着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look...

640
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,940
我知道有时我的行为像小孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know that I can act like a kid sometimes,

641
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,670
但如果你再给我次机会  我可以更加成熟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but if you give me another chance, I can be more mature.

642
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,650
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

643
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,820
你保持年轻就好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You stay young.

644
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,760
需要成长的人是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm the one who needs to grow up.

645
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
可能是卡尔的医生打来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That might be Karl's doctor.

646
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,070
我要去隔壁房间接
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I, I'm gonna take it in the other room.

647
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,490
-萨蒙妮  -不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Simone... - No.

648
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:58,810
汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy.

649
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,090
好极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, great,

650
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,050
你今天就能把钱转走  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you can transfer those funds today, right?

651
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,300
好的  谢谢  回头聊  再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, thank you. Yeah, I'll talk to you. Bye.

652
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,140
好了  我的业务经理在处理了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right. All right, so my business manager's on it.

653
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,750
他会重置我所有账户的密码
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's gonna reset the passwords to all my accounts.

654
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,380
我跟拉马尔谈了  我禁止他和泰勒交流
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I spoke to Lamar. I forbid him to speak to Taylor,

655
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,070
这样她就不能利用他来获得我的剧本报酬
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so she can't use him to try to get to my script payments.

656
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,690
真是松了口气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's a relief.

657
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,990
你觉得这样做够了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you think it'll be enough?

658
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,280
什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you mean?

659
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,790
我们之前出去的时候  泰勒来过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor was here, in the house, while we were out.

660
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,540
或许我们该换锁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe we should think about changing the locks.

661
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,390
她是我老婆  她爱我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Whoa. Uh, I mean, she's my wife and she loves me.

662
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,140
她只是想用她的方式保护我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In her way she's just trying to protect me.

663
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,380
她是想控制你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's trying to control you.

664
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,950
两者是有区别的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's a difference.

665
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,610
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

666
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,000
也许我该给她打电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, maybe I should just call her.

667
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,920
不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No!

668
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,670
我知道你想相信她会回心转意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, I know you want to believe that she's gonna come around,

669
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,840
但你得明白  她永远不可能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you have to know, deep down, there's no way she's ever

670
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,650
同意你吸毒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}gonna get on board with the idea of you using.

671
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,070
她还威胁要告诉你爸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And she's threatening to call your dad.

672
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,020
我爸  你逗我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My dad? Are you fucking kidding me?

673
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,890
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why?

674
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,730
她知道我不跟他说话的  该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She knows that I don't speak to him. Goddamn it.

675
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,530
她不能这么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She can't just fucking do that.

676
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,000
她想让你觉得渺小
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's trying to make you feel small.

677
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,020
我讨厌她这么对你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I hate that she's treating you this way.

678
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,130
我最不想看到的就是你失去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The last thing I want is to see you lose everything

679
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,510
你为之努力赚取的一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you've been working so hard to get.

680
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,990
你给谁打电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who are you calling?

681
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,690
我们的勤杂工  你说得对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Our handyman. You're right.

682
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,720
我们得把锁换了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're gonna change those fucking locks.

683
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,790
罗伯有很多运动装备
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob's got an awful lot of old sports equipment.

684
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,140
他从来不用
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And he never uses any of it.

685
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,350
我要把它们拿去当了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I'm taking it to the pawnshop

686
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,880
然后把钱给艾普尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and giving the cash to April.

687
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,920
那可有不少钱啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, that'll be a nice chunk of change.

688
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,220
要是她不用过多担心钱的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It will be easier for her to make a rational decision about the baby

689
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,560
在孩子问题上她会更容易做出理智的决定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if she's not so worried about money.

690
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,300
我还是无法相信你竟然说服了她不去堕胎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I still can't believe you talked her out of it.

691
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,790
那个可怕的地方  我实在看不下去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That horrible place? I couldn't let her stay.

692
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,660
拿着  放到箱子里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here, put this in the big pile, please.

693
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,130
我得承认我有点没想到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I got to admit I'm a bit surprised.

694
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,390
没想到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Surprised?

695
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,380
她怀上了你老公的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's pregnant with your husband's kid.

696
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,620
大多数妻子在这种情况下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Most wives in that situation

697
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,660
根本不会在乎刀有多钝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}wouldn't care how rusty the knives were.

698
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,280
不能让艾普尔或者她孩子出事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Couldn't let anything happen to April or her baby.

699
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,480
亲爱的  你知道她还是可以决定打掉的吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey, y-you know that she could still decide to get rid of it.

700
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,430
我知道  所以接下来几天里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know. That's why I have to work hard

701
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,550
我要更加努力改变她的主意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}over the next few days to change her mind.

702
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,220
跟她说说领养
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, talk to her about adoption.

703
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,290
有很多好人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, there's-there's plenty of nice people out there

704
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,830
不孕不育
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}who can't have kids.

705
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,730
我会跟她说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll mention that.

706
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,320
还有一个可能
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's also another possibility.

707
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,660
是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's that?

708
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,880
我和罗伯可以抚养那孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob and I could raise the baby.

709
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,040
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

710
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,360
我都想好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've got it all figured out.

711
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,070
我会一直陪着艾普尔直到孩子出世
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll support April until the baby arrives,

712
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,370
然后我会提出抚养它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}then I'll offer to raise it.

713
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,100
就罗伯而言  我可以计划一个方案
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}As far as Rob's concerned, I could arrange some scenario,

714
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,320
比如在公园里的摇篮车里发现被抛弃的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}finding it in a bassinet in a park, abandoned.

715
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,120
没人需要知道真相
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No one would ever have to know the truth.

716
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,890
罗伯可以拥有自己的孩子  艾普尔也能有自己的事业
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob would have his child, April could have her career,

717
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,660
皆大欢喜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}everyone would be happy.

718
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,460
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's wrong?

719
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,970
一开始我还觉得挺好玩的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At first I thought it was funny,

720
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,740
你和你老公的母狗成了朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you becoming friends with your husband's slut.

721
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,320
-希拉  别用那词  -然后  当你和她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Sheila, that word. - And then, when you kept getting

722
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,320
走得越来越近  我以为你有点疯癫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}closer to her, I thought you were a little nutty.

723
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,740
但是不是  你是变态
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But no. You're sick.

724
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,300
我不是变态
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not sick.

725
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,050
你孩子死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your kid is dead.

726
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,020
你想用艾普尔的孩子替代她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you're trying to replace her with April's baby.

727
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,260
才不是这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That is not what I'm doing.

728
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,030
从我的角度看  你就是在这么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That is what you're doing from where I'm standing.

729
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,160
你没资格评判我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're not allowed to judge me.

730
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,580
除非你给本尼挑选了棺材
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not until you pick out Benny's casket

731
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,120
为他穿上最美的衣服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and dress him in his Sunday best

732
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,880
将他葬于地下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and put him in the ground.

733
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,330
在那之前  我不想再听到你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Until you do that, I don't want to hear another word

734
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,780
任何一句话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}from you.

735
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,620
喂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

736
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,670
萨蒙妮  还好你接了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone, thank God you answered.

737
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,070
娜奥米  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Naomi. What's going on?

738
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,210
我没带钱包就出门了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I ran out without my purse,

739
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,280
我没有医保卡和身份证
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I don't have my insurance card or my ID,

740
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,570
女管家也没接电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and the housekeeper isn't answering,

741
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,150
我不知道还能打给谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I don't have anyone else to call.

742
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,300
慢点  出什么事了  你在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Slow down. What's going on? Where are you?

743
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,880
我在医院
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm at the hospital.

744
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,920
我需要我的钱包  你能带过来吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need my purse. Can you please bring it?

745
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,650
当然  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, of course. What's happened?

746
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,630
汤米出车祸了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy's been in a car accident.

747
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,170
我马上过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I'll be right there.

748
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,050
你好  有何贵干
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. Can I help you?

749
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,040
我是来找罗伯·斯坦顿的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm here to speak to Rob Stanton.

750
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,670
-你有预约吗  -没
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Do you have an appointment? - No.

751
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,110
不跟他说上话我就不走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I'm not leaving until I speak to him.

752
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,830
你说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I beg your pardon?

753
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,350
跟他说是艾普尔找她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell him it's April.

754
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,660
所以你知道我是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So you know who I am.

755
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,260
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do.

756
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,260
抱歉  但他不会见你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry, but he won't see you.

757
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,980
你真的该走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I really think that you should go.

758
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:23,720
小姐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Miss!

759
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,190
请停下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please stop.

760
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,200
抱歉  斯坦顿先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry, Mr. Stanton.

761
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,630
我跟她说了你很忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I told her you were busy.

762
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,710
没事  你想要什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's all right. What do you want?

763
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,760
占用你一分钟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}One lousy minute of your time.

764
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,900
这是你欠我的  你不觉得吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You owe me that, don't you think?

765
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,750
克莱尔  出去  把门关上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Claire, go ahead and shut the door.

766
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,190
抱歉我没有回你电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry I didn't return your phone calls.

767
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,910
我想着一刀两对更好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought a clean break was just better for...

768
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,170
我怀孕了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm pregnant.

769
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,230
别担心  我不需要你给我什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't worry. I don't need anything from you.

770
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,720
我不会留着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not keeping it.

771
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,690
你对待我的方式
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The way you treated me,

772
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,580
我本来不想告诉你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wasn't even going to tell you.

773
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,820
但我不是坏人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But I'm not a bad person.

774
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,490
你有权知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You have a right to know.

775
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,720
总之  这就是我来此想对你说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway, that's all I came here to say, so...

776
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,210
再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}goodbye.

777
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,880
祝你生活美满
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Have a nice life.

778
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,850
等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wait.

779
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,550
萨蒙妮  太谢谢你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone, thank you so much.

780
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,560
-汤米在哪  -他们在扫描他的头部
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Where's Tommy? - They're doing some scans of his head.

781
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,400
他可能有脑震荡
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He has a possible concussion.

782
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,190
他们要确保没有任何肿胀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They need to be sure there's no swelling.

783
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,390
但他不会有事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But he'll be all right?

784
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,850
他受了很多伤
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's pretty banged up.

785
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,660
他腿上划了道口子  不过他会好起来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He has a bad cut on his leg, but he'll recover.

786
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,650
-谢天谢地  -他醉酒驾驶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, thank God. - He was driving while drunk.

787
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,850
护士告诉我的时候我完全不敢相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I couldn't believe it when the nurse told me.

788
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,720
汤米绝不会...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy would never...

789
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,800
天  我的儿子到底怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}God. What's happened to my boy?

790
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,320
我感觉好惭愧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I feel so awful.

791
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,670
你能来真好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're so sweet to be here.

792
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,670
尤其是现在你还要应付自己的难事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Even now, when you're going through your own hell.

793
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,330
什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you mean?

794
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,500
我知道卡尔的事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know about Karl,

795
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,320
他染上了那个同志疾病
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how he's sick with that gay disease.

796
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,770
我不知道你听说了什么  但是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know what you've heard, but...

797
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,730
艾达·考伊跟我说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ida Coy told me.

798
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,210
她在厕所隔间里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She was in one of the stalls

799
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,470
听到了你和本奈特医生的妻子之间的对话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}when you were talking to Dr. Bennett's wife.

800
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,120
天呐  求你别再告诉任何人了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, God. Well, please don't tell anyone else.

801
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,250
卡尔一定会很生气的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl would be so upset.

802
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,190
我才不在乎卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't care about Karl.

803
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,400
我担心的是你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're the one I'm concerned for.

804
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,780
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you okay?

805
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,210
如果你是想问我有没有被染病  我没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I don't have it, if that's what you're asking.

806
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,590
但愿没有吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I hope not.

807
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,200
现在我似乎明白那些人是怎么让这病肆虐的了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No one seems to know how those people are spreading it.

808
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,400
我们把你儿子带去了房间里  想见可以去见了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We brought your son to a room if you want to see him.

809
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,490
好的  拜托了  我们走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, please, let's go.

810
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,790
但后面只允许家属进去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, but we can only allow family back there.

811
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,620
萨蒙妮也几乎算是家人了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Simone is practically family.

812
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,090
抱歉  这是规定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry, it's policy.

813
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,420
-没事  你回头打电话给我吧  -我会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- It's fine. Just-just call me later. - I will.

814
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,610
如果你需要我  我一定会支持你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I will be there for you when you need me.

815
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,520
事实是  我爱上洁德的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Truth is, I fell in love with Jade

816
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,730
完全不清楚她是个什么样的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}without really knowing who she was.

817
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,160
更糟糕的是  我把她带进了我的家中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And what's worse is I brought her into my home.

818
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,440
现在她睡在我的床上  我却住在酒店里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now she's sleeping in my bed and I'm living in a hotel.

819
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,680
我要她滚出我家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need her out of my house.

820
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,080
但我那吸毒的丈夫现在完全听她的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But she's enabling my drug addict husband

821
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:26,620
{\an9}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}限制区域

822
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,000
我觉得他是不会放她离开的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I don't think he'll just let her go.

823
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,280
更别提你我都清楚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not to mention the fact that you and I both know

824
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,370
当她觉得受到威胁时  会做出多么过激的反应
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how intensely she can react when she feels threatened.

825
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,540
如果我要把她赶出我家  我需要聪明点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If I'm gonna get her out of the house, I need to be smart.

826
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,690
我需要筹码
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need leverage.

827
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,320
我觉得你可能是帮助我的最佳人选
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I thought you might be just the person to help me with that.

828
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,810
我为什么要帮你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why would I help you?

829
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,990
我的想法是  你帮我挠背  我也帮你挠背
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm thinking, you scratch my back, I scratch yours.

830
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,840
你只需要告诉我哪里痒就行了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All you got to do is tell me where it itches.

831
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,520
他们把我的保释金定成了1万美元
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They set my bail at $10,000.

832
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,430
他们似乎觉得我很危险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They seem to think I'm dangerous.

833
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,410
算你走运  我带支票簿来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, as luck would have it, I brought my checkbook.

834
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,820
那样的话  我能帮上你什么忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, in that case, how can I help?

835
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,300
把你知道的关于洁德的一切都告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell me everything you know about Jade.

836
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,750
首先  那不是她的真名
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, for starters, that's not her real name.

837
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,130
妈的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, shit.

838
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,350
等等  亲爱的  更劲爆的还在后面呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hold on, darling. You ain't heard nothing yet.

839
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,190
我可怜的宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my poor baby.

840
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,970
他的腿怎么样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How is his leg?

841
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,110
不得不缝了几针
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, he needed some stitches,

842
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,390
不过很快就能恢复如初了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but he will be good as new in no time.

843
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,000
这是什么鬼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What in the world?

844
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,340
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}萨蒙妮

845
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,270
萨蒙妮是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who's Simone?

846
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,260
是他女朋友吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That his girlfriend?

847
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,780
这么年轻就文身
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bit young for a tattoo.

848
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,030
以后情变了肯定会后悔的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}One day he's gonna regret that.

849
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,750
她也会后悔的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So will she.

850
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,460
你好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey there.

851
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,250
感觉怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How you feeling?

852
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,400
你来了  我就觉得好多了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Better, now that you're here.

853
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,370
需要我帮忙做点什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Need help with anything?

854
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,250
我只是在给土豆削皮而已  我觉得我可以应付
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I'm just peeling potatoes. I think I can handle it.

855
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,290
我去换身衣服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm gonna change clothes.

856
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:24,060
等我换完  我要下来帮你摆桌子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When I'm done, I'll come down and set the table for you.

857
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,320
你太贴心了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're sweet.

858
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,540
利奥
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Leo.

859
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,900
你怎么来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you doing here?

860
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,450
罗伯去哪儿了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where's Rob?

861
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,410
他刚刚上楼了  是出什么事了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He just went upstairs. Is something wrong?

862
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,030
是的  你需要去我家一趟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, you need to come to our house.

863
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,960
那个人给你打来电话了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You got a phone call from you-know-who.

864
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,370
她说有要紧的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She said it's important.

865
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,790
希拉希望我告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And Sheila wanted me to tell you

866
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,330
这是她最后一次帮你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}this is the last time she's doing this for you.

867
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,050
她还在生我的气吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's still angry with me?

868
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,170
是啊  差不多吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, something like that.

869
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,500
你觉得我是个糟糕的人吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you think I'm a horrible person?

870
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,180
不  我认为你是个好女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nah, I think you're a nice lady

871
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,770
只是陷入了大麻烦中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}who's gotten herself in a real fucking mess.

872
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,350
我们来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're here.

873
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,400
她是认真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is she serious?

874
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,390
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yeah.

875
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,220
喂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

876
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,020
希拉  你怎么这么久才来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila. What took you so long?

877
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,030
说来话长  一切都还好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Long story. I-Is everything okay?

878
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,860
简直好极了  好到不能再好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Better than okay. Everything is wonderful.

879
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,620
跟我说说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell me.

880
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,280
我去了罗伯的办公室  告诉他我怀孕的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I went to Rob's office to let him know that I'm pregnant.

881
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,720
你干了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You did what?

882
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,580
我觉得那个混蛋有权知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I figured the S.O.B. had a right to know.

883
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,950
总之  我冲进他的办公室  把这事抖出来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway, I stormed into his office and I blurted it out,

884
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,550
你知道那个笨蛋干了什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and do you know what that big galoot did?

885
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:57,960
不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

886
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,470
他单膝跪地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He got down on one knee

887
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:02,230
问我愿不愿意嫁给他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and asked me if I would marry him.

888
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,740
但是  他还没离婚啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But no, but he's still married.

889
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,610
我也是这么说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's what I said.

890
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,960
但他说他的婚姻就快结束了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But he told me that his marriage is ending.

891
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,040
他说只要再给他六个月的时间就行了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He said he just needs six months.

892
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,820
六个月
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Six months.

893
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,790
到时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And then

894
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,610
他就会彻底自由了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he'll be totally free.

895
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:23,700
总之  我只想打个电话先告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway, I just wanted to call to tell you first.

896
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,230
接下来我要打电话告诉我妈了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now I have to call and tell my mother.

897
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,720
希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, Sheila.

898
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,980
我真是太幸福了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am so happy.

899
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,710
我倒是想问问你是不是遇到什么事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I would ask if everything's okay, but, uh,

900
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,880
但好像我不能再跟你说话了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't think I'm allowed to talk to you anymore.

901
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,470
所以...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So...
