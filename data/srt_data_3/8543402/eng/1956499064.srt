twice, it's minus a point,

the ball bouncing at all,

344
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:19,701
Okay, three points to anyone

345
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:21,746
who can hit it as high
as that light tower.

346
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,747
No. Let's just keep the game...

347
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,228
DENNIS:
Three points.

348
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,056
NANCY:
Dad!

349
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,406
Oh, shit.
Nancy, go get the ball.

350
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,538
You get the ball.

351
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:31,843
Come on.
Jack, go get the ball.

352
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,715
[scoffs]
I don't even want to play.

353
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,370
You've literally been doing
nothing this entire time.

354
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:37,849
- Just go get the ball.
- Go get the ball. You haven't moved.

355
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:39,808
- Shut your face.
- Hey, I don't like that.

356
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:40,852
- That's not nice.
- [grunts]

357
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,854
- Oh...
- SARAH: Are you all right?

358
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:45,466
Do I look all right?
She hit me in my penis.

359
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:46,946
- DENNIS: You all right?
- Nancy, that was not appropriate.

360
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,251
- All right?
- Why'd you hit him in the penis?

361
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,470
I didn't mean to hit him
in the penis.

362
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:50,862
I meant to hit him
in the balls.

363
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,516
- Okay, that's great.
- DENNIS: That's great.

364
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,648
- Could we go back to playing, please?
- That's nice.

365
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:54,823
Are you happy you derailed that?

366
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,912
That was an amazing
derailment, Dennis.

367
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,827
- JACK: Oh, yeah, that's really funny.
- NANCY: I know, it's so funny.

368
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,350
DENNIS:
Anyone else bored? I'm bored.

369
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:01,699
You're the only one that wants
to play the regular rules.

370
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,179
First, you hit the guy
in the penis,

371
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:04,441
and then you wouldn't
go get the ball.

372
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:05,529
SARAH: Okay,
could we stop saying "penis"

373
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,009
on the public court, please?

374
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,619
JACK: You can't close
the leads you're given,

375
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:09,620
you can't close shit.

376
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:10,926
You are shit.

377
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,493
So hit the bricks, pal,
and beat it,

378
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,103
'cause you are going out.

379
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,714
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

380
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,412
Fucking leads are weak?

381
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:19,891
You're weak.

382
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,545
I've been in this business
15 years.

383
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,765
- What's your name?
- Fuck you. That's my name.

384
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,332
You want to know why, mister?

385
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,464
'Cause you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight.

386
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,859
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

387
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,818
And your name is "wanting."

388
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,298
You can't play this man's game.

389
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:36,778
You can't close 'em,
then go home

390
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,301
and tell your wife
your troubles.

391
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,042
Because only one thing counts
in life.

00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,610

on the line which is dotted.

- Yeah, but I froze.

It felt like 20 minutes.

- No, nobody noticed.
- I noticed.

403

- Except her.
- You were asleep, so shut your stupid face.

404

Well, you shouldn't have been
looking at who was sleeping.

405

You should have been looking
at the actors

406

- acting to you.
- She's right.

407
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,518
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have
been there anyway.

- It's not for kids. -Well, anyway,

409
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,566
- it was so boring it made me fall asleep.
- Okay...

410
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,828
- Shut up.
- Sorry. -That's not true.

411
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,090
- You shut up.
- She was riveted.

412
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,353
- You were riveting.
- Sorry to... interrupt.

413
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,442
- That's okay.
- I saw you in the play earlier today.

414

You were very good.

but thank you.

Oh, no, not of him.
Of him.

- Uh, oh.

- Thank you.
- Are you gonna be making more of them?

Uh, no. I mean, yeah,
they're gonna make more,

424

You and Alison, I mean, that is

I found the most believable.

That was a good pairing.

429
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,605
And the audiences liked it.

430
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,172
But, you know,
Thomas's character, they had to

431
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,522
figure out a way for him
to get back in, and so...

WOMAN: What? We've seen it.
It's run its course.

433

I think the audience
wants something new.

434
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,570

- We're having a family meal.
- DENNIS: Sarah.

- Sorry.
- No, don't be sorry. I'm sorry.

440
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:26,453
And-and you, why don't you say,
"I'm sorry, I'm with my family"?

It just takes a minute.

442

You're his exact fan base,
by the way.

443
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,632
Normally, he's embarrassed that

444
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,068
all his fans are single women
over 50,

445
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,852
but nobody's stopped him
in a while,

446
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,420

for you to fuck up.

I know there's things that you
worry about, too, but...

478

they seem like small things,
and I get to carry around

all the big heavy shit,
and you just let me do it.

You just let me take that role

like I wouldn't like it,

I think you tried to separate me
from the fun stuff in your life

493

because you knew
if you saw me there,

494

if you saw me in it,

495
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,279
you would realize
that that's where I should be.

to feel bad about it.
