00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,516
Kids, when it comes to love,

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,685
the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,521
My first solo batch.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,649
Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer.

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,025
Here's a professional tip.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,153
If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake.

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,446
It's a beverage.

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,865
Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun,

10
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,743
and easy, and uncomplicated.

11
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,245
It was pretty great.

12
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,045
Um, are you coloring in your butt?

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,590
I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,260
I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so,

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,887
yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.

16
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:54,847
So wear another one.

17
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:55,889
I don't have another one.

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,143
I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.

19
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,938
Dude, you show up to an interview in that,

20
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,941
even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals

21
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,901
will hackey sack you straight out the door.

22
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,239
Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job.

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,158
Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid.

24
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,535
Mostly getting people coffee.

25
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,704
But the people I'm getting coffee for--

26
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,540
their bosses are going to save the world.

27
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,669
Okay, tomorrow-- oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world--

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:30,090
tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,966
A tailor?

30
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,427
Barney, I make negative $300 a week,

31
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,888
and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.

32
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,223
Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost.

33
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:43,854
And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks "suit."

34
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,357
Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,735
No thanks, dude.

36
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,033
- Noon?
- Noon. See you then.

37
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,413
- Hey, girls.
- Hey.

38
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,040
Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,375
It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.

40
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,878
Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.

41
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:08,962
Robin!

42
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,797
Oh, come on. We bust on each other.

43
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,091
We're just at that place in our strong friendship.

44
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,302
Really? Oh.

45
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,553
Get off me.

46
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,264
Oh, see? I did it again.

47
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,602
What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping.

48
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,021
You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops.

49
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,732
If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.

50
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,026
- Really? That'd be great.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,656
Huh. I should take this.

52
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,491
Hello.

53
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,576
Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow.

54
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,787
What's with inviting Punky Brewster?

55
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:45,415
Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing.

56
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,668
You had your chance, and now he's moved on.

57
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,003
Can't you just be happy for them?

58
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,297
The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.

59
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,465
Sold.

60
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,346
Victoria, what's wrong?

61
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:04,017
I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.

62
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,144
Wait. Germany, Europe?

63
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,855
It's for two years.

64
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:12,359
I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but...

65
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,694
I'm in.

66
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,029
So, this is the Europe Germany?

67
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,490
What other Germany would it be?

68
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,367
- The one in Epcot?
- Ted.

69
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,410
Sorry.

70
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,664
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

71
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,374
I don't know if I'm going to go.

72
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,669
Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?

73
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,129
I don't know.

74
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,009
I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.

75
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,135
Oh, God, no.

76
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,848
Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.

77
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,351
So, that leaves us with...

78
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,604
Either you stay here,

79
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,397
or we break up.

80
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,233
Wow.

81
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,112
Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September,

82
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,072
- we still feel...
- I have to leave on Monday.

83
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,617
- Monday, September the...?
- Ted.

84
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,079
Do you have any thoughts?

85
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,708
Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want.

86
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,503
We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.

87
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,379
It's a date.

88
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,466
And that's when things got complicated.

89
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,886
Hey, baby, how's the dress place?

90
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,096
Everything's so fluffy and white.

91
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,932
It's like shopping in a marshmallow.

92
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,808
How's Barney's tailor?

93
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:32,523
Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal.

94
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,483
It's  like shopping in Barney's mind.

95
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,735
- Well, good luck, baby.
- Bye.

96
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,240
Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this.

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,659
A tailor in the back room of a pet store?

98
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,787
Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not?

99
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,253
Ted, Sergei says stop moping around.

100
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,129
You're distracting him from his process.

101
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,673
You speak Ukrainian?

102
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,510
Guys, I'm kind of screwed here.

103
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,514
I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me.

104
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,474
And long distance definitely isn't an option.

105
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,560
No. No, no, no. No way.

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,562
You know who likes long distance? Girls.

107
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,523
It's all talking and no sex. Kill me now.

108
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,610
Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.

109
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,529
- Really? You?
- Absolutely.

110
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,197
I'm juggling four right now.

111
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,409
There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo,

112
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:29,454
there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street.

113
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,876
The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.

114
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,630
Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?

115
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,173
Yeah.

116
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,551
Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel.

117
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,803
So, I went out to visit, and there was this party.

118
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,638
And  who shows up but Gabriel.

119
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:50,100
And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache.

120
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,353
I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude.

121
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,815
So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet,

122
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,902
I got the crazy eyes going, and I said,

123
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,821
"You stay away from Lily,

124
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:09,119
or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face."

125
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,079
Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away.

126
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,748
I think he was crying.

127
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,708
I never told Lily about it.

128
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,252
To be honest, I'm not very proud of it.

129
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,048
To be even more honest, I am.

130
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,885
Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans,

131
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,386
did that little story have a point?

132
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,556
Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate,

133
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,767
long distance still almost killed us.

134
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,270
If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate,

135
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,730
you should ask her to stay.

136
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,691
Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.

137
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,735
Oh, please. You barely know this girl.

138
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,778
What's her favorite color?

139
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,571
Is she a cat person or a dog person?

140
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,573
Is she open to a three-way?

141
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,451
Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone.

142
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,829
And FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.

143
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,918
Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.

144
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,628
Are you sure?

145
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,671
All right.

146
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,132
Hello.

147
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,468
Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?

148
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,346
Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

149
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,392
Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.

150
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,061
She's a cat person.

151
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,981
I don't know this girl at all.

152
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,067
- Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.
- Yes.

153
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,362
Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?

154
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,031
Here. Play with this pin cushion.

155
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,498
God.

156
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,625
I'm going to look hot.

157
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,253
Marshall,  I can't let you waste a suit this nice

158
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,797
fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival.

159
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,257
This is a suit for winners.

160
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,467
I am getting you an interview at my office.

161
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,553
We need good men like you in our legal department.

162
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,431
We get sued a lot.

163
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,058
No way. The Kid does not sell out.

164
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,644
Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me,

165
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,230
you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.

166
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,400
No. I've made my decision.

167
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,110
So have I.

168
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,238
If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out,

169
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,782
I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time.

170
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,744
It's just too much pressure on a new relationship.

171
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,747
I'm going to tell her to go.

172
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,335
And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.

173
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,837
All right, I've been thinking a lot about this...

174
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,964
Okay, wait, before you say anything,

175
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,927
I wanted to give you this.

176
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:35,307
This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.

177
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,732
I want you to stay.

178
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:52,908
Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal.

179
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,910
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

180
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,287
- Oh, good luck, baby.
- Bye.

181
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,874
Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?

182
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,085
Nothing too huge or-or poofy.

183
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,628
I'm not really a girlie girl.

184
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,548
But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.

185
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,258
I saw a couple up front that were nice.

186
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,884
By the window?

187
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,472
No offense, dear, but those are a little out of your price range.

188
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,852
Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.

189
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,311
Oh, these women are experts.

190
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,690
They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.

191
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,027
Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!

192
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,821
At least we get free champagne!

193
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,281
- And cake.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,700
Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided

195
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,160
what to do about your doughnut fellowship?

196
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,079
You know, I don't know.

197
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,623
I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted.

198
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,042
I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.

199
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,588
Ugh. All talking and no sex. Kill me now.

200
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,926
I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One.

201
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,095
That's pretty hard to walk away from.

202
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,305
Well, I don't know.

203
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:59,099
I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity

204
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,393
to chase some guy I'd only known two months.

205
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,437
But this isn't just some guy.

206
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,063
This is Ted.

207
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,066
He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.

208
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,320
Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew!

209
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,574
I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.

210
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,743
- I really don't...
- Sex.

211
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,788
Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This bastard's kicked.

212
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,956
Thanks.

213
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,668
- Oh!
- Oh!

214
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,545
It's okay, guys, I hate it.

215
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,589
- Just horrible.
- It's bad, it's really bad.

216
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,257
Short in front, long in the back?

217
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,427
That is the mullet of wedding dresses.

218
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,640
You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once.

219
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,726
In college, I did an art course in Paris.

220
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,770
I was the only American there.

221
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,355
It was really lonely.

222
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,191
I only had one friend, Gabrielle.

223
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,735
She was kind of homely and strange-looking,

224
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,572
and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had.

225
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:59,159
Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me,

226
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,370
and I never figured out why.

227
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,997
And then I had nobody.

228
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,999
The only thing that got me through was knowing

229
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,336
that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me.

230
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:13,966
If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.

231
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,009
But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates?

232
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,636
It's too soon.

233
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,930
Ooh. Speak of the devil.

234
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,681
Hello.

235
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,975
Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?

236
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,644
Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

237
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:29,022
A cat person. Why am I not surprised?

238
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,316
Bye.

239
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,735
Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?

240
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,779
Maybe he's going to buy you one.

241
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,240
I did hear barking in the background.

242
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,908
Maybe he was in a pet store.

243
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,077
Does he want us to get a cat together?

244
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:46,206
Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.

245
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,208
That  is low.

246
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,002
Do you really think that's what he's doing?

247
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,545
Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out.

248
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,964
I would be on the next plane to Germany.

249
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,759
- Aw.
- Aw.

250
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,012
Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.

251
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,598
- Ugly, ugly, ugly.
- I don't know what to say.

252
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,018
You know what? We're doing this all wrong.

253
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:10,731
I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.

254
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,484
Are you okay?

255
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,819
I'm fine.

256
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:16,945
Okay.

257
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,407
Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.

258
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,659
I'm not, I'm just trying to support her.

259
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,579
She got a super-important dessert scholarship.

260
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,875
Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship.

261
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,045
Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic.

262
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,965
Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan,

263
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,177
but she seems to make Ted happy.

264
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:44,515
So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.

265
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,934
Somebody say "beautiful princess."

266
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:50,187
Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh!

267
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,565
This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.

268
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:58,028
Oh, look how happy she is.

269
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,823
You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women

270
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,660
who would never let any guy mess with my career.

271
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,162
And now I'm actually thinking about it.

272
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:11,500
I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.

273
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,419
I know what you mean.

274
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,046
You do?

275
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:22,594
Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and...

276
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:26,306
to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.

277
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,559
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

278
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,897
Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist.

279
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,318
Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.

280
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,529
Robin...

281
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:45,033
I think that you are the coolest.

282
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,327
I'm so glad that we're friends.

283
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,871
Oh, no way-- you're the coolest.

284
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,998
No, you are.

285
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,624
Okay, I am.

286
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,589
I'm going to stay.

287
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,719
- Aw.
- Aw.

288
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,308
Oh, I am so beautiful!

289
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,726
Oh, don't tell me how much it costs.

290
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,812
Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.

291
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,356
Wow, you look incredible.

292
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:21,278
Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?

293
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,616
Never  ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.

294
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,828
Well, it's okay.

295
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,539
You know, what makes a bride beautiful

296
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,084
is that she's just happy to be getting married.

297
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,590
Oh, guys, I know I look amazing,

298
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,053
but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?

299
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,222
Yes, you're right.

300
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:52,559
But also... you just sat down in the cake.

301
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:55,771
But, you know what?

302
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,733
It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.

303
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,861
Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.

304
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,997
It was like this when I found it?

305
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,500
And how will you be paying for this?

306
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,129
Credit card... s.

307
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,804
I wanted to give you... this.

308
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,139
This is what happens when you...

309
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,017
you  know, let them finish baking.

310
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,526
I want you to stay.

311
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,115
I have to go to Germany.

312
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,245
You're going?

313
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,581
Yes. I have to.

314
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,999
So that's what you decided?

315
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,085
Well, no-- I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying,

316
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:03,922
but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.

317
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,632
What is this, opposite day or something?

318
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,759
- No.
- So it is?

319
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,430
Ted, we've only been dating for two months.

320
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,974
I can't let you make this decision for me.

321
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,727
I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake,

322
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,854
and it reminded me how great you are.

323
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,565
Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?

324
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,609
Well, that's just crazy.

325
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,736
Oh, okay.

326
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,697
So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.

327
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,158
But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.

328
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:31,909
You'd have me.

329
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,077
We've only been dating two months.

330
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,832
Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up.

331
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,417
I hate this.

332
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,590
So... we're breaking up?

333
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,384
I guess so.

334
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,223
I guess so.

335
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,393
God, that sucks, man.

336
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,145
I'm so sorry.

337
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,856
It was just too much pressure too soon.

338
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,400
I mean, maybe it was silly to even think...

339
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,154
Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.

340
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,989
Well, thank you for acknowledging it.

341
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,241
It was weird that you hadn't.

342
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:16,411
Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?

343
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,997
- She's leaving tomorrow.
- Yeah, but she's still in town.

344
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,124
Yeah, she... she's still in town.

345
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,711
Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together.

346
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,421
Ted, think about it this way:

347
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,799
if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow,

348
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,093
would you sit on the couch and cry about it,

349
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,428
or would you run, and jump,

350
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:37,182
and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?

351
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,062
Awesome air kicks, huh?

352
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,983
- New pajama bottoms?
- You know it.

353
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,319
So we can sit around and cry, or we can run,

354
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,781
and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.

355
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,242
Wait, so we're sharing the leg?

356
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,369
No, the leg is a metaphor.

357
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,622
How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day,

358
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,876
and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next?

359
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,171
I don't know, Ted.

360
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,674
Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?

361
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,384
Well, what would you want to do?

362
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,970
Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.

363
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,846
Like go to the Mets.

364
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,347
Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.

365
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,141
See some monkeys at the zoo?

366
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,810
Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?

367
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,854
Wow! We better get going.

368
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,273
Yeah, big day.

369
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:26,815
Yeah.

370
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:30,402
And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day.

371
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:34,323
The museum, the bridge, the restaurant,

372
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:37,075
and all of those nice things.

373
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,204
Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.

374
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,290
No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up,

375
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,085
and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.

376
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,921
Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.

377
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,924
Yeah, but only, like, second base.

378
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,303
Look at us: two guys in suits.

379
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,013
You feel that slight tingle?

380
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:02,893
That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you.

381
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,729
Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.

382
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:09,775
Hey, babe.

383
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:13,070
Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.

384
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,365
So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?

385
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,743
Oh, please-- your company is not called Barney Corp.

386
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,078
Yet.

387
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,122
Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.

388
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,837
B... Barney, this says $4,000.

389
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,297
I thought you said that it was one-third price.

390
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,091
Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit.

391
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,468
Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.

392
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,389
You set this up! You set this whole thing up!

393
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:43,809
I most certainly did...

394
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,270
Well, it won't work.

395
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,690
Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor.

396
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,859
I'm not selling my soul.

397
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:56,780
Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.

398
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,117
I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.

399
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,911
What time is the interview?

400
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,080
9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes.

401
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,040
Don't worry, I know a guy.

402
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,381
I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.

403
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,634
Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the sex.

404
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,723
I'm going to miss you so much.

405
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,433
I'm going to miss you, too.

406
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:36,111
Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...

407
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,988
Even if we're not.

408
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,824
Okay.

409
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,596
Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?

410
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,015
Yes. Yes!

411
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,521
- We can beat the odds.
- Odds, schmodds.

412
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,939
It's gonna work.

413
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,608
We're going to make it work-- it'll work.

414
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,194
It didn't work.

415
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:20,781
Long-distance was and is a terrible idea,

416
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:24,618
a really terrible idea, just awful.

417
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,287
But more on that later.
