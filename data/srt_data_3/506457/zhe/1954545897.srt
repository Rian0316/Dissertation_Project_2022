86
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,067
才到达火车站

87
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,027

先生 我再也不能承受这种紧张了

00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,761
再这样下去我要疯了

我从费林托夫人那里听说了你

我很难给你什么建议
it is difficult for me to advise you

105
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,534
你给我的情况太少
since you present so few facts,

106
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,994
但我知道你是个聪明的姑娘
but I know you to be a sensible girl,

107
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,495

我只能建议你 如果一直恐惧

110
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:32,757

先生 你是否也可以帮助我呢?

117
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,487
目前 我还没办法酬谢你
At present it is out of my power to reward you,

118
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,364
但几周后我就要结婚了

119
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,366

我很乐意帮助你
I shall be happy to devote the same care

121
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,746
就像帮助你的朋友一样
to your case as to that of your friend.

但是你也可以

00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,053
带着我们搬回了他的祖屋
and took us to live in his ancestral house

157
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,304
就在斯托克摩兰
at Stoke Moran.

158
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,680
但你母亲留给你们的钱
But the money your mother left you

159
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,390
足以满足你们的需要
was enough for all your wants,

160
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,101
所以你们仍可以过富足的生活?
so that was no obstacle to your happiness?

161
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:53,189
我继父发生了可怕的转变
A terrible change came over my stepfather,

162
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,024
他不和人交朋友 也不去
instead of making friends and exchanging visits

163
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,776
拜访邻居
with our neighbors,

164
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,110
他们一开始十分高兴
who at first were overjoyed

165
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,905
看到罗依罗德家人回到故乡
to see a Roylott back in the family seat,

166
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,698
但他把自己关在房子里
he shut himself up in the house

167
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,700
沉湎于和人疯狂争斗
and indulged in ferocious quarrels.

168
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,078
从那时到现在 我们很难避免
At times it was and still is hard to keep him out

169
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,121
他进警察局
of the police courts.

170
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,873
他成了村中一霸
He's become the terror of the village.

171
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,458
他允许别人拜访吗
Does he permit any visitors?

172
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:17,588
不 除了我的未婚夫和一些流浪的吉普赛人
No, except my fianc?and some wandering gypsies.

173
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,090
吉普赛人?
Gypsies?

174
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,092
流浪者 他允许他们
Vagabonds, whom he has given leave

175
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,719
在他的土地上扎营
to encamp on his land.

176
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:28,015
有时 他和他们一出去就是好几天
Sometimes he goes away with them for days at a time.

177
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,434
你可以从我的描述中看出来
You can imagine from what I'm saying

178
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,479
我可怜的姐姐朱莉亚和我
that my poor sister Julia and I

179
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,983
生活中几乎没什么乐趣
had no great pleasure in our lives.

180
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,860
仆人都待不了多久
No servant would stay long

181
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:43,447
所有的家务都是我们俩做
so we did all the work of the house.

182
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,451
她年仅三十岁就去世了
She was but 30 when I lost her,

183
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,745
那时她的头发已经花白了
but already her hair had begun to whiten,

184
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,998
和我的一样
even as mine has.

185
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,083
你姐姐死了?
Your sister is dead?

186
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,919
就在两年前
Just two years ago.

187
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,255
这正是我想要和您讲的
It is of that I wish to talk to you.

188
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,222
在我们这样的生活中
Living the life we did,

189
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,807
几乎不可能见到
we were little likely to see anyone

190
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,144
跟我们地位年龄相仿的人
of our own age and position,

191
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,731
但偶尔我们也会允许有些拜访
but we were occasionally allowed short visits.

192
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,399
两年前
Two years ago,

193
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,693
朱丽亚遇到了一个半薪海军少校
Julia met a half-pay major of marines,

194
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,778
之后他们订婚了
to whom she became engaged.

195
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:28,034
征得你继父的同意了?
Your stepfather approved of the match?

196
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,411
他根本就没有一点反对
He raised no objection at all.

197
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,832
婚前两星期
A fortnight before the wedding,

198
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,751
发生了一件可怕的事
a terrible event occurred

199
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,504
夺走了我唯一的伙伴
which deprived me of my only companion.

200
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:46,093
请说的详细些
Praybe precise as to details.

201
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,971
这容易
It is easy,

202
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:54,310
那晚每一幕都烙在我脑海中
every event of that night is seared into my memory.

203
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,147
那天深夜 大约十一点
It was late, about 11:00,

204
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,775
朱丽亚跑到了我的屋里
Julia had come into my room.

205
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:14,372
他又在抽那些难闻的雪茄了
He's smoking those awful cigars again.

206
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,375
也许你婚礼前应该住这个房间里
Perhaps you should have this room until the wedding.

207
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:33,516
哦 海伦 我真幸福
Oh, Helen, oh, I feel so happy.

208
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,103
可我也担心把你一个人留在这里
And yet wretched that I'm leaving you here alone.

209
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,438
我迟早也会离开的
My turn will come.

210
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,108
我会想你的
I shall miss you.

211
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,611
不用 我会去看你
No, you won't, I'll come and stay.

212
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:49,073
另外 你的少校也答应给我
Besides, your major has promised to find me

213
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,284
介绍一个相同级别的军官
a brother officer of equal rank,

214
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:57,373
绝对比他英俊
and infinitely better looking.

215
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:04,755
亲爱的 怎么了?
My darling, what is the matter?

216
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,467
海伦 你听到过有人吹口哨吗
Helen, have you ever heard anyone whistle

217
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,513
在深夜里?
in the dead of night?

218
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:17,268
你睡觉时该不会吹口哨吧
I suppose you couldn't possibly whistle yourself, in your sleep?

219
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,105
当然不能 怎么了?
Certainly not, why?

220
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,941
这几天夜里
The last few nights,

221
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,694
大约凌晨三点
always about 3:00 in the morning,

222
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,947
我总会被微弱而清晰的口哨吵醒
I've been woken by a low, clear whistle.

223
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,657
我也说不出是哪儿传来的
I can't tell where it's coming from.

224
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,160
还以为你也听到了呢
I thought you might have heard it.

225
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:39,123
我睡得比你沉
I sleep more heavily than you.

226
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:45,463
可能是那些吉普赛人
It was probably those wretched gypsies.

227
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:50,510
算了 不管了
Well, never mind.

228
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,612
你们在晚上
Was it your custom always

229
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,697
总会锁好门窗吗?
to lock yourself in at night?

230
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,909
会的 我继父热爱
Always, my stepfather has a passion

231
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,203
饲养印度动物
for Indian animals.

232
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,121
有一只豹子 一只狒狒
A leopard and baboon

233
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,458
在我们庄园里活动
wander freely over the grounds.

234
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,544
朱莉亚和我总觉得不安全
Julia and I had no feelings of security

235
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,046
除非把门窗锁上
unless our doors and windows were locked.

236
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,970
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep,

237
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:39,058
有种很不好的预感
I had a vague feeling of misfortune.

238
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,942
朱丽亚
Julia!

239
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,886
救救我
Please help me.

240
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:30,318
哦 天哪 海伦 是带子
Oh, my God, Helen, It was the band...

241
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:36,073
一条斑点带子
the speckled band.

242
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,408
我去叫父亲
I'll get father.

243
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,494
不
No!

244
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,457
回房间去 孩子
Go into your room child,

245
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,251
这里我来处理
I'll deal with this.

246
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,240
很抱歉 先生们
I am sorry, gentlemen.

247
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:13,202
我姐姐和我很亲密
My sister and I were very close.

248
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:17,331
那是当然
Yes indeed.

249
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,042
多么悲伤的经历
What a mournful experience.

250
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:27,258
而你完全不知道是什么引起了
And you've no idea what might have caused -

251
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:30,970
这阵口哨和金属声
This whistle and metallic sound,

252
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:34,056
你肯定听到了?
you can swear to it?

253
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:36,600
我印象很深
It is my strong impression,

254
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:39,562
但也有可能是被误导了
I may possibly have been deceived.

255
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:41,230
你姐姐当时穿好衣服了?
Was your sister dressed?

256
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:43,649
没有 她穿着睡衣
No, she was in her night dress.

257
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,110
地板上有支蜡烛
Uh, on the floor there was a candle

258
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:48,320
还有截火柴头
and the charred stump of a match.

259
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:51,198
也就是说 她被什么东西吵醒了
Which means, something must have woken her up,

260
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:56,787
点起蜡烛想看看发生了什么
and she struck a light to see what the matter was.

261
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,998
验尸官的结论是什么?
What conclusions did the coroner come to?

262
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:00,749
他很仔细地做了调查
He investigated the case with great care,

263
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,587
但他没发现任何合理的死因
but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death.

264
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:06,338
根据你的描述
And your evidence would have shown

265
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:09,175
门是从里面锁上的
that the door was fastened on the inner side,

266
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:12,178
窗也关的很严实 每晚都是
the windows blocked by shutters, secured every night.

267
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,846
因此 可以确定的是
It is certain, therefore,

268
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:16,640
你姐姐是独自一人
that your sister was alone

269
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:19,602
走向死亡的?
when she met her end?

270
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,187
是的
Yes.

271
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,771
另外 她身上
Besides, there were no marks

272
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:26,150
也没有打斗的痕迹
of violence upon her.

273
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:29,695
会是投毒吗?
What about poison?

274
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:36,243
医生查了 没查出中毒迹象
The doctors examined her for it, without success.

275
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:43,542
那你认为 这位不幸的女士是怎么死的?
What do you think this unfortunate lady died of, then?

276
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:45,544
我相信她死于
It's my belief that she died

277
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:49,507
纯粹的恐惧和精神焦虑
of pure fear and nervous shock,

278
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,637
尽管我不知道是什么让她如此受惊
though what it was which frightened her I cannot imagine.

279
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:58,182
你觉得她说的带子是什么意思 斑点带子?
What do you gather from the allusion to a band, a speckled band?

280
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:01,060
胡话
Delirium.

281
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:06,690
或是戴着带子的人
Or some band of people.

282
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:10,736
庄园里的吉普赛人会把
The gypsies at the plantation have spotted

283
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:16,951
斑点手帕系在脖子上
handkerchiefs they wear around their necks.

284
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:22,581
里面有很多隐情
These are very deep waters.

285
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:26,001
你姐姐死后发生了什么?
What happened after your sister's death?

286
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:28,921
我的生活更寂寞了
My life was lonelier than ever

287
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,506
直到一个月前
until a month ago,

288
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,424
我的一个好朋友
when a dear friend of mine,

289
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,176
相识多年的
whom I have known for many years,

290
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:36,846
他盛情向我求婚
did me the honor to ask for my hand in marriage.

291
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:38,973
他叫珀西阿米蒂其
His name is Mr. Percy Armitage.

292
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:42,977
你们几周内就要结婚了
And you are to be married within a few weeks.

293
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,562
那你为什么来找我呢
So what prompted you to come here

294
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,106
你的生活似乎走上了正轨
when your life seems set so fair?

295
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:50,150
昨天 房子的修葺开始了
Yesterday, some repairs were started

296
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:52,236
我的房间被穿了个洞
and my bedroom wall was pierced,

297
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,071
所以昨晚我只能
so that last night I was forced

298
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:56,782
搬到朱莉亚死去的屋子里
to move into the chamber in which Julia died,

299
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:58,200
就睡在那张
to sleep in the very bed

300
00:21:58,325 --> 00:21:59,743
她临死睡的床上
in which she slept.

301
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:02,121
想想我有多恐惧 半夜里被
Imagine my terror when I was woken by the same

302
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:05,875
预示她死亡的低低哨音惊醒
low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.

303
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,293
你点了灯?
You lit a lamp?

304
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,628
是的 但什么也没发现
Yes, but nothing was to be seen.

305
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:11,213
我害怕得睡不着
I was too shaken to sleep.

306
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:12,882
便穿好衣服溜出了房间
I dressed and slipped out of the house.

307
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:14,466
在皇冠旅馆找到辆马车
I got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn,

308
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,302
赶到伦敦 只有一个目的
and came to London with one objective,

309
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:19,930
征求你的意见
asking your advice.

310
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:24,518
你很明智
You did wisely.

311
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:28,522
可你全都告诉我了吗?
But have you told me all?

312
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,274
是的
Yes.

313
00:22:30,357 --> 00:22:34,862
没有 斯通小姐
You have not, Miss Stoner.

314
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:39,658
你在袒护你的继父
You are shielding your stepfather.

315
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:42,536
他很严苛 可他仍然
He is a hard man, but he's still

316
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:46,999
是我唯一的父亲
the only father I have known.

317
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:49,960
我想到早饭时间了
I'd say it was time for some breakfast.

318
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:52,463
我还有许多细节要了解
There are a thousand details I desire to know

319
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:54,715
不然我无法行动
before I decide on a course of action.

320
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,010
如果我们今天去斯托克摩兰
If we were to come to Stoke Moran today,

321
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:59,553
能看看这些房间吗
could we see over these rooms

322
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,014
在你继父不知道的情况下?
without the knowledge of your stepfather?

323
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:03,432
刚好 他说过
As it happens, he spoke of coming

324
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,142
今天要来城里办事
to town today on some business.

325
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:06,227
那工人呢?
And the workmen?

326
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,186
我没看见
I have seen none.

327
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:08,938
我们有一个本村的女仆 来做打扫
We have a woman who comes to clean from the village,

328
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:10,356
但只在早上
but only in the morning.

329
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,774
那儿应该没什么人打搅你们
There should be nothing to disturb you.

330
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:12,233
很好
Excellent.

331
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,193
华生 你不会介意跑一趟吧?
Watson, you are not averse to this trip?

332
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,320
绝不会
By no means.

333
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:19,281
那我们午后去找你
Then we will be with you in the early afternoon.

334
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:21,200
我会等你们到来
I shall be there for your arrival.

335
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:26,705
你真不留下吃早饭吗?
You'll stay for some breakfast, surely?

336
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:28,666
谢谢 不了
Thank you, no.

337
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,590
我心里轻松了不少
My heart is lightened already.

338
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:52,982
哈德森太太 谢谢你
Ah, Mrs. Hudson, thank you.

339
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:58,028
当你联想夜半的哨音
When you combine the ideas of whistles at night,

340
00:23:58,112 --> 00:24:00,030
一群吉普赛人
the presence of a band of gypsies

341
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:02,366
和他们过从甚密的医生
on intimate terms with the doctor,

342
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:07,371
还有一个斑点带子的遗言时
the dying allusion to a speckled band, well,

343
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:09,456
完全可以相信奥秘
there's good ground to believe that the mystery

344
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,042
就在这些线索里
may be cleared along those lines.

345
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:21,594
哪一个是福尔摩斯?
Which one of you is Holmes?

346
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:24,054
是我 先生
My name, sir;

347
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:26,849
但你应该先自我介绍一下
but you have the advantage of me.

348
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:28,559
我是格莱斯比・罗依罗德医生
I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott,

349
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:33,147
来自斯托克摩兰
of Stoke Moran.

350
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:38,235
是吗 医生 请坐
Indeed, Doctor, please take a seat.

351
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,779
我才不听你使唤
I shall do nothing of the kind.

352
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:42,531
我知道我的继女
I know that my stepdaughter

353
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:44,617
今早来过这里
has been here this morning.

354
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:47,244
她对你说了什么?
What has she been saying to you?

355
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:51,540
今年这时候比往年冷些
It is a little cold for the time of the year.

356
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:53,501
她对你说了什么?
What has she been saying to you?

357
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:56,420
但我听说庄稼收成不错
But I have heard that the crops promise well.

358
00:24:56,504 --> 00:25:00,466
你在耍我 是吗?
Ah, you put me off, do you?

359
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,676
你这个无赖 先生
You scoundrel, sir.

360
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,304
我以前听说过你
I've heard of you before.

361
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:07,223
你就是福尔摩斯 爱管闲事的人
You are Holmes, the meddler,

362
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:08,474
福尔摩斯 挑事的
Holmes the busybody,

363
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:12,478
福尔摩斯 苏格兰场芝麻官
Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office.

364
00:25:12,603 --> 00:25:15,940
和你谈话真的很有趣
Your conversation really is most entertaining,

365
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:18,108
请你离开时
if you would close the door,

366
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:22,488
随手关门 貌似有阵微风吹过
on your way out, as there is a decided draft.

367
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:25,699
我不说完自然不会走
I will go when I have said my say.

368
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,869
你吃豹子胆了 敢管我的事
Don't you dare to interfere in my affairs.

369
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,706
我知道斯通小姐来过这里
I know that Miss Stoner has been here.

370
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,267
惹了我可没好果子吃
I am a dangerous man to fall foul of.

371
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:03,863
谢谢你 哈德森太太 只是个客户而已
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, just another client.

372
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:09,201
多么可亲的人
What a very amiable person.

373
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,829
我可能没那么大块头 可是...
I may not be quite so bulky, but -

374
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:19,712
他实在太傲慢了
fancy his having the insolence

375
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:23,507
竟然把我跟官方探员混为一谈
to confound me with the official detective force.

376
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:27,803
这倒使案子更有趣味了
Ah, this incident gives zest to our investigation.

377
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:29,471
我只是希望我们的朋友
I only hope our friend won't suffer

378
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:31,473
不会为轻率地留下了行踪
from her imprudence in allowing that brute

379
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,142
而吃苦头
to trace her here.

380
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:35,436
我一直在想一个问题 华生
One thought keeps nagging at me, Watson,

381
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:38,189
罗依罗德在印度的职业生涯
Roylott's professional life in India,

382
00:26:38,272 --> 00:26:39,607
如果那么成功
if it was so successful,

383
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,442
为什么他会回来过这种
why would he exchange it for a life

384
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,611
没落贵族的生活?
of aristocratic penury?

385
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:46,405
我朋友库默可能会知道
My friend Cooms would know.

386
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,408
库默当时也在加尔各答
Cooms was in Calcutta around that time.

387
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:50,868
找到你的朋友库默
Find your friend Cooms

388
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:54,580
看看我们从他那里能得到什么
and see what you can get from him.

389
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:56,874
我要去趟医师协会
I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons,

390
00:26:56,957 --> 00:26:58,751
希望能得到一些资料
where I hope to get some data

391
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,628
可能会对案子有帮助
which may help us in this matter.

392
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:06,592
我们下午一点在滑铁卢车站大钟下见
Let us meet again at 1:00 under the clock at Waterloo Station.

393
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,178
如果到时你能吃完早饭的话
That is, if you've finished your breakfast by then.

394
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:12,681
对了 带着你的左轮手枪
Oh, and your revolver,

395
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:14,808
我要求你一定要揣在口袋里
I would be obliged if you would slip it into your pocket.

396
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,602
埃利2号手枪正好对付
An Eley #2 is an excellent argument

397
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:20,105
能把钢制拨火棍拧弯的先生
against gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.

398
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:22,316
还有 你的牙刷
That, and your toothbrush,

399
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,902
我想就这些了
are I think all we need.

400
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,407
我看了他亡妻的遗嘱
I've seen the will of the deceased wife.

401
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:32,284
在她死时 她每年的收入
Her annual income at the time of her death

402
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,120
将近1100磅
was a little short of 1100 pounds,

403
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:37,122
但由于农产品价格下跌
but, due to the fall in agricultural prices,

404
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:39,750
现在只有不到750磅了
there's now no more than 750 pounds.

405
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,126
每一个女儿在结婚后
Each girl in case of marriage,

406
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,795
都将得到250磅
could claim 250 pounds.

407
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,297
所以 如果两个女儿都结婚的话
So, if both girls had married, ah, beauty,

408
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:49,635
格莱斯比・罗依罗德的就会少得可怜了
Grimesby Roylott would have had a mere pittance.

409
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,472
甚至其中一个结婚也会毁了他
And even one marriage would ruin him.

410
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:57,810
这是最可能的作案动机
The strongest possible motive.

411
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:01,647
哦 你找到库默了吗
Oh, did you manage to find Cooms?

412
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,524
找到了
Yes, I did.

413
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,442
他真是很难找
He proved rather hard to locate,

414
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:06,819
但最终我还是找到了
but I finally managed

415
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:09,196
就在巴兹的斯万松郡
to get him through Swanson at Bards.

416
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,824
在加尔各答他的确认识罗依罗德
He did know Roylott in Calcutta,

417
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:15,369
证实了那女孩所说的
confirmed what the girl had said,

418
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,955
还说了一件有趣的事
and added one intriguing fact.

419
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,791
当时发生了多起盗窃案
Now, it seems that a series of robberies

420
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,751
就在他的房子里
had been perpetrated in his house,

421
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:25,212
嫌疑落到了他的当地管家头上
and suspicion fell on his native butler.

422
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,840
罗依罗德当场揪住他
Roylott promptly seized the man,

423
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:29,383
在盛怒之下
and in a fit of anger

424
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:32,428
把那可怜的人打死了
beat the poor fellow to death,

425
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:35,097
虽然勉强逃过了死罪
narrowly escaped a capital sentence,

426
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:37,433
但他还是坐了很久的牢
but suffered a long term of imprisonment,

427
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,518
回国的时候
and returned to this country

428
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:45,441
已变成了一个阴郁的人
a morose and disappointed man.

429
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:51,113
华生 这真是个罪恶的世界
Ah, Watson, it's a wicked world.

430
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:56,202
尤其当一个聪明人把头脑用于犯罪
And when a clever man turns his brain to crime,

431
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:59,622
那是最糟糕的了
it's the worst of all.

432
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,724
先生们 你们是来渡假的吗?
On holiday, are you, gentlemen?

433
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:21,060
不 我们是建筑师
No, we're architects,

434
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:23,187
来看看当地的房子
taking a look at some of the local houses.

435
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,065
所以你们要去斯托克摩兰
Ah, that's why you're wanting Stoke Moran.

436
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:29,068
真没想到是为社交原因
I didn't think it was for social reasons.

437
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:33,364
那你们要和罗依罗德医生做生意?
You'll be, doing business with Dr. Roylott then?

438
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:36,075
是的 我想就是他
Yes, I believe that was the name.

439
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:37,868
如果不介意 我提醒你们
If you don't mind a word of warning,

440
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:40,412
要提防着点这个人 先生
you want to take care with him, sir.

441
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:41,997
当地的人说
There are some round these parts

442
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:44,166
他脑子有些不正常
say he's not right in the head.

443
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,417
是吗?
Really?

444
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:48,504
就在昨天 铁匠肖恩先生
Only yesterday, Mr. Thorn, the blacksmith,

445
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:52,049
和医生闹得很不愉快
had a most nasty experience with the Doctor

446
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:54,009
因为他让那些吉普赛小偷
because of those thieving gypsies

447
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:56,428
在他那里扎营
who are camped in the grounds.

448
00:29:56,554 --> 00:29:59,139
对 我们听说吉普赛人了
Oh, yes, we've heard about the gypsies

449
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:00,307
还有豹子
and the leopard.

450
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,268
结果呢
The story goes,

451
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:04,770
医生把肖恩扔进了河里
the Doctor threw Mr. Thorn in the stream

452
00:30:04,854 --> 00:30:06,939
他脾气失控了
in a fit of uncontrollable temper.

453
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:08,816
肖恩先生也是个大个子
And that Thorn, he's not a small man.

454
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:12,778
老天 那不是要被捕了吗?
Good Lord, is he bringing a charge of assault?

455
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:15,114
本来是的 但斯通小姐
He was going to, but Miss Stoner,

456
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:17,533
医生的年轻养女
the Doctor's young stepdaughter,

457
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:21,620
自掏腰包给了他一些封口费
paid him some of her own money to keep it quiet.

458
00:30:21,745 --> 00:30:23,247
这就是我听到的
Well, that's what I heard.

459
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:26,083
我倒没听说
Well, I never.

460
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,835
你呢 福尔摩斯
Did you hear that, Holmes,

461
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,962
对那位年轻女士的事听得越多
the more I see and hear of that young lady,

462
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:32,631
我就对她越敬佩
the more my admiration increases,

463
00:30:32,756 --> 00:30:35,843
确实是精神可嘉的女士
young woman of commendable spirit.

464
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:38,929
就停这儿吧 车夫
You can pull up here, driver.

465
00:30:39,054 --> 00:30:41,473
你是指谁?
Who do you mean?

466
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:43,809
当然是斯通小姐
Well, Miss Stoner, of course,

467
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:45,603
令人敬佩
most admirable.

468
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:47,646
啊 斯通小姐
Ah, Miss Stoner.

469
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:13,005
一切都很顺利
Everything worked splendidly.

470
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,381
罗依罗德医生去了伦敦
Dr. Roylott has gone to London

471
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:16,300
要到晚上才回来
and he won't be back before the evening.

472
00:31:16,383 --> 00:31:17,927
但我们以经有幸
But we have already had the pleasure

473
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:19,887
和罗依罗德医生相识了
of Dr. Roylott's acquaintance.

474
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,388
天啊 他跟踪我?
Goodness, he followed me?

475
00:31:21,514 --> 00:31:23,891
是的 你一走他就进来了
Yes, he turned up just after you left,

476
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,977
但福尔摩斯把他嘲笑走了
but Holmes sent him off with a flea in his ear.

477
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:28,521
他太狡猾了 我真不知道
He's so cunning, I never know

478
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:30,523
在他身边还有没有安全可言
when I'm safe from him.

479
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:32,650
当然 他也得当心
Well then, he must guard himself,

480
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,693
不然他可能发现有人
or he may find someone more cunning

481
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:36,529
在这种事上比他更狡猾
than himself upon his track, shall we.

482
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:39,698
福尔摩斯 你不认为我们应该
Holmes, don't you think we ought to get

483
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:41,909
让斯通小姐今晚离开吗?
Miss Stoner away from here tonight?

484
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,118
好引起猜疑?
And arouse suspicion?

485
00:31:43,244 --> 00:31:44,537
但如果他来粗的...
But if he's violent ...

486
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,539
我们守在这儿
We shall be here.

487
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:07,309
那么这就是罗依罗德医生的房间
So this is Dr. Roylott's room,

488
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:09,353
这是你姐姐原来的
this formerly your sister's,

489
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:10,813
这是你的?
and this your room?

490
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:12,857
是的 我现在睡这一间
Yes, I am now sleeping in this one.

491
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,360
啊 因为修缮
Ah, pending the alterations.

492
00:32:16,443 --> 00:32:19,071
斯通小姐 我可以问个问题吗
Miss Stoner, may I ask something,

493
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:20,656
这有点不寻常吧
that's unusual, isn't it,

494
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:23,325
卧室都设在一楼?
bedrooms on the ground floor?

495
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,743
卧室都搬下来了
The bedrooms were moved downstairs

496
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:26,370
房子大部分都在腐坏
when so much of the house fell into decay.

497
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:29,665
原来如此 真是可悲
Oh, yes, of course, how sad.

498
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:35,588
这好像没什么可修的
There seems little need for repairs

499
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:37,381
在房子的这一头
to this end of the house.

500
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:39,133
根本没有 我认为
There are none, I believe it

501
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:42,720
那只是为了让我换房的借口罢了
was an excuse to move me from my room.

502
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:47,474
啊 很有可能
Ah, that is suggestive.

503
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,518
斯通小姐 能否请你
Miss Stoner, would you be so kind

504
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:51,270
进到你的房间里
as to go into the room

505
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:53,022
就是你现在的卧室
in which you are now sleeping

506
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:56,066
然后把百叶窗闩好
and bolt the shutters.

507
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:11,040
你在干什么 华生?
What are you doing, Watson?

508
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:14,543
我在使用你的方法 福尔摩斯
Well, I'm using your methods, Holmes,

509
00:33:14,668 --> 00:33:18,214
检查地面上有没有被踩过的痕迹
seeing whether the ground has been disturbed.

510
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:21,467
那你找到什么了?
And what have you come up with?

511
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:24,345
我想是你的脚印
Your footprints, I believe,

512
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,431
还有我的和斯通小姐的
and mine and Miss Stoner's,

513
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:29,391
还有这个
and this.

514
00:33:54,875 --> 00:34:00,548
如果闩上的话 没人能从这进去
No one could pass these if they were bolted.

515
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:06,011
好吧 让我们看看里面有什么可疑的
Well, let's see if the inside throws any light on the matter.

516
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:52,474
这个铃通什么地方?
Where does that bell communicate with?

517
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,393
通女管家的房间
It goes to the housekeeper's room.

518
00:34:54,518 --> 00:34:56,770
似乎比别的东西新
It looks newer than the other things.

519
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,356
是的 刚安也就两年多
Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.

520
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,025
是你姐姐要求的吗?
Ah, your sister asked for it?

521
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:02,484
我从未听见她用过
I never heard of her using it.

522
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,071
我们一般自己去取想要的东西
We used to get what we wanted for ourselves.

523
00:35:06,197 --> 00:35:07,948
是吗 请原谅
Indeed, you will excuse me

524
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:11,160
我要在地板上好好查一查
while I satisfy myself as to this floor.

525
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:34,433
不响
It doesn't ring.

526
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:37,144
真奇怪
That's very strange.

527
00:35:50,157 --> 00:35:55,412
通往隔壁的通风口
A ventilator into another room.

528
00:35:55,496 --> 00:35:59,291
你是说 它可能是用于
You mean, when it might have

529
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:02,419
和外界交换空气?
communicated with the outside air?

530
00:36:02,503 --> 00:36:04,171
那也是新安的
That is also quite modern.

531
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,423
是的
Indeed.

532
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:08,968
斯通小姐 如果你允许
Miss Stoner, with your permission,

533
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:10,803
我们要开始检查
we will now carry our research

534
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:13,681
罗依罗德医生的房间了
to Dr. Roylott's chamber.

535
00:36:35,536 --> 00:36:37,163
这里面有什么?
What's in here?

536
00:36:37,288 --> 00:36:38,914
我继父的商业文件
My stepfather's business papers.

537
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,666
你亲眼看过里面?
Ah, you've seen inside it, then?

538
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:42,209
只有一次 几年前
Only once, some years ago.

539
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,963
我记得里面全是文件
I remember it was full of papers.

540
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:48,841
这里有猫吗?
Is there a cat in there?

541
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:52,511
没有 干吗这么问?
No, what a strange idea.

542
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:57,474
看看这个
Well, look at this!

543
00:36:57,558 --> 00:36:59,810
不 我们不养猫
No, we don't keep a cat.

544
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:04,732
哦 豹也算是一种大型猫吧
Ah, well, a leopard is a large cat, after all.

545
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:06,525
对 但一小碟牛奶远远
Yes, but a saucer of milk wouldn't go far

546
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:12,239
填不饱一只豹子
in satisfying a leopard.

547
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:15,784
豹是被皮带拴着的吧?
The leopard is kept on a leash, is it?

548
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,247
这种皮带吗 华生?
This sort of leash, Watson?

549
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,541
你觉得它是做什么用的?
What do you make of it?

550
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,668
很普通的狗颈皮带
Well, it's a common enough dog leash,

551
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:28,839
但我不明白为什么要打结
but I don't know why it should be tied.

552
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:33,135
我们没有狗
We have no dog.

553
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:39,600
谢谢你 斯通小姐 我看得足够了
Thank you, Miss Stoner, I have seen enough.

554
00:37:57,993 --> 00:38:03,332
我只想问他要不要喝茶
I was going to ask if he'd like some tea.

555
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:07,586
斯通小姐 这至关重要
Miss Stoner, it is very essential

556
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:11,215
你得完完全全按我的指示做
that you absolutely follow my advice in every respect.

557
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,551
关系到你性命
Your life may depend on it.

558
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:15,886
我保证 我全听你的
I assure you that I'm in your hands.

559
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,763
首先
In the first place,

560
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:20,516
我们来的路上经过了一间小屋
on the way here we passed a small cottage.

561
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,934
那是杂物间
The shill house.

562
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:23,602
你姐姐房间的窗户
Will the windows of your sister's room

563
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:25,229
从那儿能看到吗?
be visible from there?

564
00:38:25,354 --> 00:38:26,313
能
Yes.

565
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:27,523
你确定?
You are sure?

566
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,024
是的
Yes.

567
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:31,610
那我们可以待在那儿
Then we shall make it our base.

568
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:33,279
要吃的吗?
Some refreshment?

569
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:37,783
我们先去吃饭吧 福尔摩斯?
We shall have dine shalt we, Holmes?

570
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,369
村里有旅馆吗?
Is there a village inn?

571
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,537
王冠旅馆
The Crown.

572
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,746
那就行了
Oh, good.

573
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,791
多谢您的好意
Thank you all the same.

574
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,169
现在 斯通小姐
Now, Miss Stoner,

575
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:50,462
等你继父回来以后
when your stepfather returns,

576
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:52,756
你得把你自己关在房间里
you must confine yourself in your room

577
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,092
假称你头痛
on pretense of a headache.

578
00:38:55,176 --> 00:38:56,552
然后 夜里当你听到
Then when you hear your stepfather

579
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,179
你父亲就寝后
retire for the night,

580
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,763
你必须走到窗口
you must go to the windows,

581
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:02,224
松开窗栓 打开百叶
undo the hasp, open the shutters,

582
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:04,977
点一盏灯放在窗台上
and leave your lamp on the window sill

583
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,687
给我们发信号
as a signal to us.

584
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,023
然后带上你需要的东西
Then withdraw with anything you may want

585
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:10,983
回你以前的屋里过夜
for the night to your old room.

586
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:12,776
我相信 尽管那里在改造
I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs,

587
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,570
但呆一晚还不成问题吧
you could manage there for one night.

588
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:17,281
好的 当然
Oh, yes, of course.

589
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:19,533
现在 我们得走了
And now, we must leave.

590
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:22,703
如果罗依罗德医生回来发现我们在这儿
If Dr. Roylott should return and find us here,

591
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:26,332
我们这趟就白跑了
our journey would be in vain.

592
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:27,791
我相信 福尔摩斯先生
I believe, Mr. Holmes,

593
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:32,004
你已经有了论断
that you've already made up your mind.

594
00:39:32,129 --> 00:39:33,547
请行行好
For pity sake,

595
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:36,133
告诉我姐姐是怎么死的
tell me the cause of my sister's death.

596
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:37,885
勇敢点
Be brave.

597
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,470
如果你照我说的做
If you do as I have told you,

598
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:41,013
保证很快就能消除
rest assured we shall soon drive away

599
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:45,643
对你的威胁
the dangers that threaten you.

600
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,501
对 看得很清楚
Yes, it is a clear view.

601
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:29,232
你觉得要守一整夜吗 福尔摩斯?
Are you expecting this to take all night, Holmes?

602
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:36,990
有可能 什么都有可能
It's possible, anything's possible.

603
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:41,369
当一个医生开始作恶
When a doctor goes wrong,

604
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:44,747
他会是首屈一指的罪犯
he is the first of criminals.

605
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:49,460
他有胆识 有知识
He has nerve, he has knowledge,

606
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:53,047
帕默和普利查德就是他们这行的代表
Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession,

607
00:40:53,173 --> 00:40:58,136
而这个人更高深莫测
this man strikes even deeper.

608
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:03,725
我确实有些犹豫是否该带你来
I really have some scruples taking you tonight.

609
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,853
这次显然有致命危险
There is a distinct element of danger.

610
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:11,983
只要我能帮上忙
If I can be of assistance?

611
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:16,196
你太好了
That's very kind of you.

612
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,748
在那间屋子里 你显然
You evidently saw more in those rooms

613
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:30,126
看到的比我多 福尔摩斯
than was visible to me, Holmes.

614
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:37,258
不 可我推断的比较多
No, I probably deduced a little more.

615
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:39,802
还记得斯通小姐说过的吗
Do you remember Miss Stoner said

616
00:41:39,928 --> 00:41:41,513
她姐姐可以闻到
that her sister could smell

617
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:45,350
罗依罗德医生的雪茄?
Dr. Roylott's cigar?

618
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:46,851
是啊
Well?

619
00:41:46,976 --> 00:41:49,854
通风口 是通风口造成的
The ventilator, a ventilator made,

620
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:55,193
一条悬着的绳索 一位女人躺在床上 死了
a cord hung, and a woman who lies in the bed, dies.

621
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:57,946
我看不出有什么联系
I can't see any connection.

622
00:41:58,029 --> 00:42:05,370
你注意到床有什么特别了吗?
Did you notice anything peculiar about the bed?

623
00:42:05,495 --> 00:42:09,165
被固定在地板上了
It was clamped to the floor.

624
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:13,002
它动不了 固定在那里
It could not be moved, had to remain in the same

625
00:42:13,086 --> 00:42:19,008
对着通风口和铃绳
relative position to the ventilator and the rope,

626
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:22,887
或者所谓铃绳 因为很显然
or so we may call it, since it was clearly

627
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:29,811
它从来不是打铃用的
never made for a bell pull.

628
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:34,732
我似乎有点明白你的意思了
I begin to see dimly what you're driving at.

629
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:37,610
我们正好赶上阻止一起
We're only just in time to prevent some

630
00:42:37,694 --> 00:42:49,330
阴险而可怕的犯罪
subtle and horrible crime.

631
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,727
晚安
Goodnight.

632
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,990
今天过得好吗?
Did you have a good day?

633
00:44:06,115 --> 00:44:14,332
倒有些趣事
Not without interest.

634
00:44:14,457 --> 00:44:18,127
你早晨去哪儿了?
Where did you get to this morning?

635
00:44:18,253 --> 00:44:22,549
我也去了城里
I decided to go to town, too.

636
00:44:22,674 --> 00:44:28,805
得为婚礼置办些东西
I had some shopping to do for the wedding.

637
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:31,933
你知道我也要去的
You knew I was going up,

638
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:35,979
我们可以一起走的
we might have traveled together.

639
00:44:36,062 --> 00:44:38,815
我走得早些
I left early.

640
00:44:38,898 --> 00:44:42,986
对 我知道
Yes, I know you did.

641
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:45,572
是为了在午饭前赶回来
So that I should be back by lunchtime,

642
00:44:45,697 --> 00:44:50,326
我下午还有些事要做
I had some things to do here this afternoon.

643
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:56,958
我只是心血来潮跑去的伦敦
My trip was a whim.

644
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:06,050
你一直就是个小撒谎精
You always were a good little liar.

645
00:45:06,176 --> 00:45:12,390
抱歉失陪了 我头痛得厉害
If you'll excuse me, I have a terrible headache.

646
00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:19,939
福尔摩斯 爱管闲事的 福尔摩斯 挑事的
Holmes, the meddler, Holmes, the busybody,

647
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:27,030

信号
The signal.

649
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,353
天 那是什么?
My God, what's that?

650
00:46:40,436 --> 00:46:42,814
那只狒狒
It's the baboon.

651
00:46:42,939 --> 00:46:46,943
多好的一家人
This is a nice household.

652
00:47:11,634 --> 00:47:16,598
我们不能点灯
We must sit without light.

653
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:40,371
别睡着
Do not fall asleep;

654
00:47:40,497 --> 00:47:44,959
你的性命取决于此
your very life may depend upon it.

655
00:49:41,284 --> 00:49:43,745
看到了吗 华生 看到了吗?
You see it, Watson, you see it?

656
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:59,802
是什么意思
What can it mean?

657
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:02,805
全都结束了
It means it is over,

658
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:05,808
也许 这是最好的结局
and perhaps, for the best.

659
00:50:05,892 --> 00:50:09,646
来 华生 带上枪
Come Watson, bring your pistol.

660
00:50:25,745 --> 00:50:30,291
是带子 斑点带子
It's the band, the speckled band,

661
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:32,669
那是条沼泽蝰蛇
it is a swamp adder,

662
00:50:32,752 --> 00:50:36,005
产于印度的致命毒蛇
the deadliest snake in India.

663
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:39,467
他被咬后几秒内就死去了
He has died within seconds of being bitten.

664
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:26,347
施暴者 确实
Violence does, in truth,

665
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:28,933
会被自己的暴行所害
recoil upon the violent,

666
00:51:29,058 --> 00:51:31,936
阴谋家最终埋葬于
and the schemer falls into the pit

667
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:34,481
自己给别人挖的坟墓
which he digs for another.

668
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:38,943
我想到是蛇是因为
The idea of a snake occurred to me

669
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:40,737
当我联想起
when I coupled it with the knowledge

670
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:42,447
医生能够得到
that the Doctor was furnished

671
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:44,407

00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:50,914
任何化学检测查出
by any chemical test.

675
00:51:50,997 --> 00:51:53,041
它可能会咬 也可能不会咬
It might, or might not bite

676
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,959
躺在床上的人
the occupant of the bed.

677
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:57,045
她可能幸运地逃脱一周
She might escape every night for a week,

678
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,713
但迟早
but sooner or later,

679
00:51:58,796 --> 00:52:01,341
她会成为牺牲品
she must fall a victim.

680
00:52:01,424 --> 00:52:05,720
可怜的朱丽亚
Oh, my poor Julia.

681
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:08,515
医生训练了蛇
The Doctor had trained the snake,

682
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:10,183
可能是用牛奶
probably with the milk,

683
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:12,602
用哨音把它召回
to return at the sound of a whistle,

684
00:52:12,727 --> 00:52:13,895
那个哨音
the very whistle

685
00:52:13,978 --> 00:52:17,065
就是你和你姐姐都听到过的
which you and your late sister heard.

686
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,483
我检查了医生屋里
My inspection of the chair

687
00:52:18,608 --> 00:52:20,276
那把椅子 发现他
in Dr. Roylott's room had shown that he

688
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,195
有站在椅子上
had been in the habit of standing upon it

689
00:52:22,278 --> 00:52:24,656
够通风口的习惯
to reach the ventilator.

690
00:52:24,781 --> 00:52:26,533
昨晚我袭击了那条蛇
Last night when I attacked the snake

691
00:52:26,616 --> 00:52:28,660
把它从通风口打了回去
and drove it back through the ventilator,

692
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:30,620
我激怒了蛇
I roused its snakish temper,

693
00:52:30,745 --> 00:52:32,330
导致它攻击了
causing it to turn upon

694
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:34,874
看到的下一个人
the next person that it saw.

695
00:52:34,958 --> 00:52:38,211
格林斯比・罗依罗德医生
Dr. Grimesby Roylott.

696
00:52:38,294 --> 00:52:40,129
所以你 福尔摩斯
So you, Holmes,

697
00:52:40,213 --> 00:52:41,798
间接导致了
were indirectly responsible

698
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:44,801
他的死亡

699
00:52:44,884 --> 00:52:47,136
我得说 这事并没有

700
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:51,266
给我的良心造成多大负担
to weigh very heavily on my conscience.
