1
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:04,800
再给你讲个有趣的气象小知识
And here's another interesting weather fact.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,533
又一个? 太好了!
Another? Great!

3
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:10,867
喷流的变化可以影响到
Changes in jet streams can affect the speed

4
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:13,167
地球的自转速度
at which the Earth rotates on its axis,

5
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:16,633
所以坏天气真的可以使一天变长
so bad weather can actually make the day longer.

6
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:19,301
这么说 现在世界上肯定有个地方在刮风暴
Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.

7
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:23,434
随便开玩笑吧
Joke if you must,

8
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:25,500
但你会怀念这些时刻的
but you're going to miss these moments.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,234
再几天Leonard就回来了
With Leonard home in a few days,

10
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,401
这是你最后一次载我去购物了
this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.

11
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:32,401
嗯 我会想念的
You know, I will miss this.

12
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,533
跟你说 要是我的苹果是面的
I'll tell you what, if my apples are mealy,

13
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:39,900
我们就再去农品部来个大采购
we'll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,134
这次你可以推购物车
Heck, you can even push the cart.

15
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:46,468
请不要把我对Leonard回家的盼望看成是
Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard's return

16
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:49,700
对这些天你所做工作的批评
as criticism of the job you've been doing in his absence.

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,067
我不会的
I won't.

18
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:56,001
批评会晚点写在你的报告卡上
That criticism will come later in your report card.

19
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,101
不过没人能管我
Yeah, I didn't stay for the detention,

20
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,967
我不会看报告卡的
I'm not gonna read the report card.

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
你好
Hello.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,633
Leonard啊!
Leonard!

23
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,967
嘘 嘘! 嗨!
Shh, shh. Hi!

24
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,401
小声点 哦 天呐
Keep your voice down. Oh, my God.

25
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,633
你不是星期天才回来吗?
You weren't supposed to be here till Sunday!

26
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:10,900
我们实验提前做完了
We finished the experiment early,

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,600
所以我想回来给你个惊喜
so I thought I'd come home and surprise you.

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,067
哦 我的天 为什么我们要小声说话?
Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?

29
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:14,967
我还没告诉Sheldon
I didn't tell Sheldon,

30
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,700
这样我们就可以单独过几天了
so we could have a few days alone.

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,633
哦 这太浪漫了
Oh, that is so romantic.

32
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,700
呃 是啊 我就是这么想的
Uh, sure, that's why I did it.

33
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:25,434
哦... 我还是不敢相信你回来了
Oh... I just cannot believe you're here.

34
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:26,867
Penny 你今天走运了!
Penny, it's your lucky day!

35
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,834
有三个鸡蛋显然不是巨大号的
Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo.

36
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,067
拿钥匙走吧
Grab your keys.

39
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,767
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

40
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,468
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

41
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,967

呃 Stuart 我在想
Uh, Stuart, I was wondering

48
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,501
你是否能帮我找样东西
if you could help me find something.

49
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,334
很乐意 除非是找希望或者活下去的原因
Happy to, unless it's hope or a reason to live.

50
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:12,601
哦 你把我逗乐了 悲催的孩子 
Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown.

51
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,167
不管怎样...
Anyhoo...

52
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,668
Leonard几天后就会回来
Leonard will be back in a couple days

53
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:20,000
我得给他准备个欢迎礼物
and I need a welcome-home gift for him.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,501
由于他去的是海上 也许
As he's been at sea, perhaps something

55
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:25,167
航海主题的东西比较合适吧
with a nautical theme might be appropriate.

56
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,967
嗯 好吧 我不知道你的预算是多少
Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend,

57
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:31,201
但我这儿确实有个很酷的水行侠雕像
but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.

58
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,967
水行侠?
Aquaman?

59
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:39,367
哦 这可不是个搞笑礼物 Stuart
Oh, this isn't a gag gift, Stuart.

60
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,867
差不多吧
Yeah, just as well.

61
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:43,467
这是个很稀有的
It's a pretty rare piece.

62
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,833
我倒更愿意卖给一个真正的收藏家
I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.

63
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,234
我是个真正的收藏家啊
I'm a real collector.

64
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,434
有多稀有?
How rare is it?

65
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:52,934
我就不该提到它的
Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it.

66
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,534
来个蝙蝠侠喷水枪怎么样?
How about a Batman squirt gun?

67
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,267
别想勾引我去买一个
Don't try and trick me

68
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,367
我不想买的东西
into buying something I don't want.

69
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:01,367
接着说水行侠
Now let's talk Aquaman.

70
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:05,733
他们在想什么啊 把章鱼博士的大脑放进
What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus's mind

71
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,501
蜘蛛侠的身体?
in Spider-Man's body?

72
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,501
好吧 我其实很喜欢看
Well, I've been quite enjoying that.

73
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,833
它结合了蜘蛛侠超级英雄的乐趣
It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man

74
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,733
和"辣妈辣妹"的换位把戏
with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday.

75
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,700
两个版本: 原版和洛翰版的
Both versions: original and Lohan.

76
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,100
"两个版本: 原版和洛翰版的"
"Both versions: original and Lohan."

77
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,267
你就是个白痴
You're an idiot.

78
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,501
嘿 你怎么了?
Hey, what's your problem?

79
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,767
抱歉 我最近有些暴躁
I'm sorry, I've been kind of snippy lately.

80
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,034
估计是节食的原因
It's probably this stupid diet I'm on.

81
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,100
你为啥要节食啊?
Why are you on a diet?

82
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,067
我长了好几磅
I've put on a couple pounds.

83
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,501
不得不到男装部买裤子了
Had to buy these pants in the men's section.

84
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,034
好吧 我们都见过你老妈了
Well, we've all seen your mom.

85
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:42,800
龙生龙凤生凤
That Butterball turkey

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,733
基因是不骗人的
was bound to come home to roost.

87
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:48,800
1200美元! 不能再多了!
$1,200! That's my final offer!

88
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,234
好吧 Sheldon 你赢了
All right, Sheldon, you win.

89
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:54,334
我敢肯定Leonard会喜欢得不得了
I'm sure Leonard is gonna love this.

90
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,067
哦 对了 Leonard的礼物
Oh, right, a present for Leonard.

91
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,733
你最好把那把水枪也放进来吧
You better throw in that squirt gun.

92
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,434
对了 我也不知道

93
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:05,201
这把水枪 它 呃 它也很稀有
This squirt gun, it's, uh, it's pretty rare.

And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.

96
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,501

- Here's some money.  - Thank you.

103
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:26,634
我要去撞个头了
And I'm gonna hit the head.

104
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,334
这是我们这帮老水手们
That's what us salty sea dogs say

105
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,900
要去尿尿的说法
when we have to go pee-pee.

106
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:34,201
- 嘿  - 22.5美元

Seriously?

109
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,967
我刚刚爬了有四层楼梯啊
I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.

110
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:40,967
哦
Oh.

111
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,501

而且我保证我不会告诉你老板
and a promise I won't call your boss

115
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,967
你一身大麻味儿
and tell him you reek of marijuana.

116
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,100
哦 Penny 你叫了匹萨
Oh, Penny, I see you've ordered pizza.

117

我买了中国食物
I have Chinese food.

118
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:57,833
真好
That's nice.

119
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,267
哦 好天然的古龙水啊
Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne.

120
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,934
我叔叔之前常常用
My uncle used to wear that.

121
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,000
也许在Leonard回来之前我们可以
Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,733
- 最后共享一次晚餐  - 是啊 谢谢
- before Leonard returns.  - Yeah, thanks,

123
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,401
但我今晚有点想自己一个人吃 所以...
but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so...

124
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,668
你确定?
Are you sure?

125
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:16,267
有了你的意大利匹萨和我的中国面条
With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles,

126
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,833
我们可以玩马可・波罗
we could play Marco Polo.

127
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,867
当然 我是说 重现一下威尼斯探险家
I mean, of course, a reenactment of a meal

128
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:23,234
马克・波罗生前的餐饭
in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer,

129
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:26,767
而不是那个叫马可・波罗的恐怖水上游戏
not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.

130
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:29,767
是啊 听起来很有意思 但谢谢不了
Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.

131
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,201
晚安哈!
Have a good night!

132
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:33,034
什么... 你有伴儿了?
What, now... do you have company?

133
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:34,833
不 不 不 不
No. No, no, no.

134
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,467
知道吗? 马桶最近老这样
You know what? Th-The toilet's been doing that.

135
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,000
我叫了楼管 所以...
I called the building manager, so...

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,067
- 哦 我可以帮你看看  - 呃...
- Oh, I can take a look at it.  - Well...

137
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,267
我修水管很熟练
I'm quite familiar with plumbing.

138
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,634
不是吹的
Not to brag,

139
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,934
五年级一年我的头几乎都埋在马桶里面过的
but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.

140
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,534
是啊 不 不 不
Yeah, no, no, no.

141
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:49,000
知道吗 Sheldon 没事的
You know what, Sheldon, it's okay.

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,700
你没必要到洗手间去
You don't have to go into the bathroom.

143
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,201
真让人好奇
That's curious.

144
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,601
要是这里没别人
If there's no one here,

145
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:56,800
桌上为什么摆了两杯红酒?
why are there two glasses of wine on the table?

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,367
哦
Oh.

147
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,134
呃 你知道 我有两只手
Well, you know, I-I've got two hands

148
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:02,467
还有点嗜酒
and a bit of a drinking problem.

149
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,900
当然
Of course.

150
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,067
问了个傻问题
Ask a silly question.

151
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:05,867
哦
Oh.

152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,700
真奇怪
That's odd.

153
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,501
呃 什么?
Um, what?

154
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,733
垃圾桶里面有
There are takeout containers

155
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,067
外卖的盒子
in the trash can.

156
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,668
那又怎样? 那是我昨晚上吃的
So? That's my dinner from last night.

157
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,634
奇怪的是它们在垃圾桶里面
What's odd is they're in the trash can.

158
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:19,100
好吧
Okay.

159
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,234
听着 宝贝儿 我向你保证这里没人
Look, honey, I promise there's no one's here.

160
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:21,467
我干了一天活
I've had a long day.

161
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:22,867
就是想安安静静一个人吃个晚饭
I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.

162
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:25,401
哦 好吧
Oh, very well.

163
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,601
我也常常会享受独处的乐趣
I'm no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude.

164
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,134
- 哦!  - 什么?
- Oh!  - What?

165
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:34,034
你有给Leonard买欢迎礼物了吗?
Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?

166
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:35,201
- 没  - 哦 太好了
- No.  - Oh, great.

167
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:36,634
你想不想跟我一起送一个
Do you want to go halfsies

168
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,234
两百块的喷水枪?
on a $200 squirt gun?

169
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,534
嗨 亲爱的
Hi, honey.

170
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:43,601
嘿
Hey.

171
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,201
我做了巧克力蛋糕 要不要来一个?
I made some brownies. You want one?

172
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:47,900
你在开玩笑吗 啊?
You're kidding, right?

173
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,201
你知道
I mean, you know

174
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,034
我正减肥呢
I'm trying to lose weight.

175
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:55,601
天 我以为在婚姻中夫妻应同心协力
God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.

176
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:57,334
是同心的 别埋怨了
We are. Stop it.

177
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,167
而且最后再说一次 你不胖
And for the last time, you're not fat.

178
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,234
是吗? 跟体重秤说去
Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale,

179
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:03,534
因为你们其中一个在撒谎
'cause one of you is lying.

180
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:05,967
好吧 当我没问
Fine, forget I asked.

181
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,000
在你妈家吃的晚饭怎么样?
How was dinner at your mom's?

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,134
很糟糕
Awful.

183
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,634
我又得帮她全身擦药膏
I had to rub her ointment all over her again.

184
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,267
她干嘛不自己来?
Why can't she do it?

185
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,301
因为我们母子关系亲密得不正常
'Cause we've got a deeply unhealthy relationship.

186
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,967
这倒提醒我了
Which reminds me,

187
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,334
你能从实验室弄点这个样品吗?
do you think you can get any samples of this from work?

188
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:23,000
本来够她用一个月的
This was supposed to last her a month,

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,100
但医生没考虑到
but they didn't take into account

190
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,967
她后背的面积
the square footage of her back.

191
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:30,568
我看看
Let me see.

192
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:32,201
你帮她擦药膏多久了?
How long have you been putting this on her?

193
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,334
不记得了
I don't know.

194
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:34,367
几个星期吧 怎么了?
Few weeks. Why?

195
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,234
这是非常强的雌激素药膏
This is really strong estrogen cream.

196
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:38,934
别告诉我你没戴手套
Please tell me you've been wearing gloves.

197
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:41,534
这肿成香肠的手能戴上手套嘛
Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.

198
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:45,733
Howei 雌激素被你的皮肤吸收了
Howie, the estrogen's getting absorbed by your skin.

199
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,100
所以你才
That's why you've been

200
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,067
浮肿 易怒 特别欠抽
all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.

201
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:54,467
你全身都是雌激素也没这样啊
You're full of estrogen and you don't act like that.

202
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,733
因为我是女的
That's 'cause I'm a woman.

203
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,100
专业驾驭这猛兽几十年了
I've had years of practice riding the dragon.

204
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:01,833
好吧
Fine.

205
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,367
下次我会戴手套的
I'll wear gloves next time.

206
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,800
但荷尔蒙完全从你体内排出
It's still gonna take a few weeks

207
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,334
还需要好几个星期
for the hormones to leave your system.

208
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:08,833
我真是又傻
I feel so stupid.

209
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,634
又胖
And fat.

210
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:13,034
没关系的
It's okay.

211
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,134
在我心中你仍然最美
You still look great to me.

212
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:17,267
这样吧 要不我们去卧室里
In fact, why don't we go in the bedroom

213
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,167
我证明给你看啊?
and I'll prove it to you?

214
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,601
做爱? 不是吧?
Sex? Really?

215
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,833
你就会来这一套!
I mean, that's just your solution to everything!

216
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:26,967
哦 还有个有趣的事
Oh, and here's a fun thing.

217
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,867
我想到了两个不同的单词
I worked it out so that there are

218
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,267
描述勺子
two different words for spoon:

219
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,934
{\an8}(Planko Montoya一种运动 用短木棍击球防止落地；Janko一种怪物，需要处女献祭，也指很长的鲸鱼阴茎)

220
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,934
"planko"和"janko."
"planko" and "janko."

221
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:35,267
"Planko"指有食物的勺子
"Planko" is a spoon with food,

222
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,067
"janko"指没食物的勺子
"janko" is a spoon without food.

223
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:40,967
{/an8}(ptang代指阴道，所以是"空"的)

224
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:40,967
"Janko"结尾还有不发音的"ptang"
"Janko" is spelled with a silent "ptang."

225
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,201
Sheldon 你根本就没在听
Sheldon, you're not even listening

226
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,501
我新编语言的规则
to the rules of my made-up language.

227
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,000
我听着呢
Yes, I am.

228
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
那"tweepadock"什么意思?
Then what does "tweepadock" mean?

229
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,501
呃...
Uh...

230
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:53,833
大象?
elephant?

231
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,000
{\an8}(大家先猜一下为什么 解释在片源最后)

232
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,000
算你走运
Lucky guess.

233
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,067
抱歉
I'm sorry.

234
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,668
我只是被之前Penny那发生的事
I'm just distracted by something

235
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,134
分心了
that happened over at Penny's.

236
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,334
怎么了?
What happened?

237
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:07,167
我觉得Penny对Lenard不忠了
I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.

238
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,201
什么?
What?

239
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:10,201
她说自己是一个人
She claimed to be alone

240
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:13,167
但明显还有别人在她房间
when there was obviously someone else in her apartment.

241
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,767
我别无选择只能做最坏的打算
I have no choice but to assume the worst,

242
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,100
因为Leonard出海考察
given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage

243
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,334
她的地狱之门又极其贪婪
and her famously ravenous nether regions.

244
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,501
我觉得Penny不会背叛Leonard的
I don't think Penny would cheat on Leonard.

245
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:25,700
你确定?
Oh, really?

246
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,401
我们曾经有一次对视比赛
She and I once had a staring contest.

247
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:34,234
她大声拍手让我眨眼了
She clapped really loud and made me blink.

248
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:38,700
作弊和劈腿只有一线之差
It's a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.

249
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,833
你别胡说了
You're being ridiculous.

250
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,334
Amy 她的中国菜饭盒
Amy, there were Chinese food containers...

251
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,401
是在垃圾桶"里"的
in the trash can.

252
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,934
可怜的Leonard
Poor Leonard.

253
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,334
听到什么了吗?
Do you hear anything?

254
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,301
有一个女人的声音
I hear a woman's voice.

255
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,568
是Penny吗?
Is it Penny?

256
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,100
不 是你
No, it's you.

257
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,401
好吧 我听到低声私语和笑声了
All right, I hear whispering and giggling.

258
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,967
现在有接吻的声音
Now I think I hear kissing.

259
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,967
切 你知道接吻什么声音吗
Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.

260
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:16,401
星际迷航里见过 小样
There's kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.

261
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:18,100
让我听听
Let me listen.

262
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,034
好像是Leonard的声音
Sounds like Leonard.

263
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,434
拜托
Please.

264
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:25,401
Leonard干嘛提前回家
Why would Leonard come home early

265
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,501
浪费时间吻Penny
and waste his time kissing Penny

266
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,534
他完全可以和他最好的小伙伴玩耍啊?
when he could be hanging out with his best buddy?

267
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,334
不管了
Yeah, that's it.

268
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,967
我要捉奸在床了
I'm catching her in the act.

269
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,934
别 Sheldon 别
No, Sheldon, don't.

270
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,301
抓到了!
Aha!

271
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:39,634
搞什么?!
What the hell?!

272
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:40,934
真是你 Leonard?
Leonard?

273
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:42,900
Sheldon 你不能就那么闯进来的!
Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that!

274
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,967
没错
Right.

275
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:48,501
Penny开门!
Penny!

276
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,867
Penny开门! Penny开门!
Penny! Penny!

277
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,217
你要开门吗?
Are you going to answer the door?

278
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,457
还是我再开门 再抓你们一次?
Should I open and say "Aha!" again?

279
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,633
对不起 Sheldon
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

280
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,934
我应该告诉你我回来了
I should've told you I was back.

281
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:11,700
我只是想和Penny过几天二人世界
I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.

282
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,600
不不 该道歉的是我
Oh, no, I should apologize.

283
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,734
我没有意识到我们的友谊
Uh, I never realized to what extent

284
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,767
让你如此难以承受
our friendship was a burden to you.

285
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,500
这么说不对
That is not fair.

286
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,867
我一个月至少抱怨一次受不了了
I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.

287
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,434
别别别 请不要美化这件事
Oh, no, no, let's not sugarcoat this.

288
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:28,334
你就是觉得我挑剔 卖弄 而且烦人
You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.

289
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:29,600
他没有
No, he doesn't.

290
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,867
我之前确实一字不差地说过
I actually have used those exact words before.

291
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,434
也是这个顺序
In that order.

292
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,700
好吧 Leonard 我觉得是时候
Well, Leonard, I think it's high time

293
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,134
说出"大象"了("大"声说出真"相")
you and I address the "tweepadock" in the room.

294
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,134
啥?
The what?

295
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:45,834
- 解释一下 Amy?  - 别把我扯进来
- Amy?  - Please leave me out of this.

296
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,600
呃... 好吧
Uh... fine.

297
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,800
Leonard啊
Leonard,

298
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,101
你没必要再继续
there's no need for you

299
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,600
假装喜欢我了
to pretend to like me anymore.

300
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,267
别这样 我都道歉过了
Come on, I said I was sorry.

301
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,967
不不 你的道歉还是留到
No, no, you save your apologies

302
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:58,134
和Penny做爱不欢的时候说吧
for after you've had disappointing coitus with Penny.

303
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:02,934
其实还好啦
It was fine.

304
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:04,600
拜托 别傻了
Come on, this is silly.

305
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,434
对了 我这次出门
Hey, um, I brought you back

306
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,633
给你带回一个小礼物 不错吧?
a little present from my trip, huh?

307
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,633
是你想要的水手帽
It's that sailor cap that you wanted.

308
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:13,967
挺赞的 是吧?
It's neat, huh?

309
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,767
你真的以为一个破纪念品
You honestly think you can buy back my friendship

310
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,167
就能买回我的友谊吗?
with a cheap souvenir?

311
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,034
不是的
I don't.

312
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,034
真的不是
No, I really don't.

313
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,434
试试嘛
Just try it on.

314
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,667
好看啊
Oh, yeah.

315
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,500
- 你好 水手  - 哦 这才是正点
- Hello, sailor.  - Ooh, now we're talking.

316
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,633
失陪一下
Excuse me.

317
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,234
这改变不了什么
This changes nothing.

318
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:47,533
不过今年万圣节的服装
Except the Halloween costume

319
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,700
会变一下
I'm wearing this year.

320
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,767
Amy 你要扮成奥丽弗(大力水手中女主角)
Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl.

321
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,201
别吃太胖
Lay off the donuts.

322
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,967
感谢你过来
Thanks for coming over.

323
00:12:58,967 --> 00:12:59,967
没什么
No problem.

324
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,734
哦 你做了小三明治!
Ooh, you made little sandwiches!

325
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:04,401
是啊 这是黄瓜和奶油芝士
Yeah, that's cucumber and cream cheese.

326
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,167
还有鸡肉和罗甘莓
That's turkey and loganberry.

327
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,900
别告诉我的屁股 但烤炉里还热着干酪
And don't tell my hips, but I'm warming up a brie in the oven.

328
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
不错啊...
Nice. So...

329
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
嗯 什么事?
Mmm. What's up?

330
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,900
是这样的 我一直在仔细研究
Okay, well, I've been reading up on all the side effects

331
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
雌激素的所有副作用
you can get from estrogen,

332
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,234
发现...
and...

333
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,934
我需要你说实话
I need you to be honest with me.

334
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:26,468
我的胸部看起来变大没?
Do my boobs look bigger to you?

335
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:29,301
这个 有点难说啊
Well, it's kind of hard to tell.

336
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,267
Raj 你只要说"是或不是"
Come on, Raj, it's a "yes or no" question.

337
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,600
我不确定
I'm not sure.

338
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,700
等下
Um, wait.

339
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,134
那你跳起来 看看会不会乳摇
Jump up and down... let's see if they jiggle.

340
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,500
哦 不...
Uh, no, I...

341
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,234
我还是说不清...
I still can't tell, uh...

342
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,967
知道吗? 学哥这样做
Oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.

343
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:54,334
真的吗?
Seriously?

344
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,567
你到底想不想搞清楚?
Do you want my help or not?

345
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,600
好吧
Fine.

346
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,234
好了
Okay, yup.

347
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,867
瞧 看上去... 觉得...
See, see, that... that looks like...

348
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:08,900
你的乳量还有增长的空间
that looks like they could be bigger.

349
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:11,967
但我觉得 我乳摇... 我乳摇起来
But you know, I bet... I bet when I do it,

350
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,900
也很波涛汹涌
mine do the same thing.

351
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,201
确实
Yeah, they kind of do.

352
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:21,934
好 让我感受一下
Hmm. Uh, let me see something.

353
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:24,600
温柔一点!
Hey, easy!

354
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,267
我的乳头很敏感的
My nipples are sensitive.

355
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,267
哦
Oh.

356
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,434
不好意思...
Sorry, sorry, uh...

357
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:32,001
好了
Okay.

358
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,967
我觉得...
I mean...

359
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:42,934
可能...
Yeah, m... maybe.

360
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:45,001
我也摸摸你的
Okay, let me feel.

361
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,533
不 我罩杯肯定比你大
No, I am definitely up a cup size.

362
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,767
但是... 你的胸部很坚挺
You know, b... but they're very firm,

363
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:59,301
这点挺不错的嘛
so you've got that going for you.

364
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,434
真的?
You think?

365
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,434
恩 恩 很挺拔
Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.

366
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:04,834
谢了 
Thank you.

367
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,700
我真的很需要温暖人心的话
I really needed to hear that today.

368
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,067
干酪做好了!
Ooh, brie's ready!

369
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,034
耶!
Yay!

370
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,134
早上好
Good morning.

371
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:19,500
好啊
Hello.

372
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,001
那么今早是我送你去上班
So am I driving you to work

373
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,867
还是说仍旧对我生气?
or are you still mad at me?

374
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,401
我想搭你车
I'd like a ride.

375
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,667
如果你确实是把我
Assuming you actually do

376
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,167
送去学校的话
take me to work.

377
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,967
那我还能把你带哪儿去?
Where do you think I would take you?

378
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,067
谁知道呢?
Who knows?

379
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,101
你说你昨天才会到家
Uh, you said you'd be home yesterday,

380
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,267
但其实三天前就回来了
but you came home three days ago.

381
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:38,500
你说你带我去上班
You say you're taking me

382
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,834
但据我所知
to work, but for all I know,

383
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:44,401
我可能会被抛弃在废弃的游乐场里
I'll end up in a deserted amusement park.

384
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,067
或是玉米田里
Or a cornfield maze.

385
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,867
或者丢到小巷里去看狗咬狗
Or a back alley dog fight.

386
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:50,500
不如你说呢
You tell me.

387
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,567
我是去上班
I'm going to work.

388
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,001
你想就一起来吧
You can come if you want.

389
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:56,234
好啊
Okay.

390
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:59,600
你衬衣上有点东西
By the way, you have something on your shirt.

391
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,101
没有啊
No, I don't.

392
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,401
被欺骗的感觉不好受吧? 
Hurts, doesn't it?

393
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,633
你知道 我怀疑
You know, I find myself wondering

394
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:12,101
你对我从来没说过真话
if anything you've ever told me is true.

395
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,667
我没能回来
I didn't make it back.

396
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,667
船把我沉向地狱了 
The ship sank, I'm in hell.

397
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:21,967
你说你来自新泽西州 但我怎么相信你呢?
You say you're from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?

398
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:24,834
为什么会有人撒谎说
Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey

399
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,834
来自新泽西呢?
if they weren't?

400
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,034
那倒是 我同意
All right, I'll give you that one.

401
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,667
我说过对不起了
Hey, I said I was sorry.

402
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,334
你还想怎么样呢?
What else do you want from me?

403
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,301
我要你承认 你的所作所为是错误的
I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.

404
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,301
好
Fine.

405
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,600
我做错了
What I did was wrong.

406
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,267
我倒是想相信你
I wish I could believe you.

407
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,134
你知道吗?
You know what?

408
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,468
我不会载你去上班了
I'm not driving you to work,

409
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:48,101
因为你实在是太讨厌了
because you're incredibly annoying.

410
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:50,900
真是典型的说一套 做一套
You say one thing and do the other,

411
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,700
那也就是说你肯定会载我 然后觉得我特讨人喜欢
so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.

412
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,633
- 别说了  - 继续说?
- Stop it.  - Keep it up?

413
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,468
再见!
Bye!

414
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:58,900
你好!
Hello!

415
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:07,633
你意思是你没有对我竖起中指?
So I guess you're really holding up the other four fingers?

416
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:12,167
嘿 怎么来得这么早啊?
Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?

417
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,334
载Sheldon去学校
Driving Sheldon to work.

418
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,001
他还在生Leonard的气吗?
He's still mad at Leonard, huh?

419
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,434
他也在生你的气
Well, he's mad at you, too.

420
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:20,167
他说你是个邪恶的媚魔 专门诱惑他的好朋友
He says you're the succubus who led his friend astray.

421
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,834
我虽然不知道什么是媚魔 但是...
I don't know what "succubus" is, but...

422
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:27,368
有个"傻比"在里面 所以肯定不是个好东西
it has "suck" in it, so that can't be good.

423
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,934
就说听见你声音了
Thought I heard you out here.

424
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:31,867
嘿 Sheldon
Hey, Sheldon.

425
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:33,267
你可没有"嘿"
You don't get a "hey."

426
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,234
你有"哼"
You get a "hmm."

427
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:36,800
别这样
Come on, don't be like that.

428
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,500
我们前几个月在一起玩的多开心啊
We had so much fun together the last couple of months.

429
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,834
没错
You're right.

430
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,567
越是好朋友背叛我 我就越伤心
Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.

431
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:43,800
Sheldon啊...
Sheldon...

432
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,700
我让你用我的超市会员卡
I let you buy feminine hygiene products

433
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,600
去买卫生巾
with my supermarket club card.

434
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,800
你知道我邮箱里有都是些
You have any idea the kind of coupons

435
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,533
什么东西的优惠宦?
I'm going to get in the mail now?

436
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,234
Sheldon 你和Leonard之间的争吵
Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard.

437
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,734
Penny可是无辜的...
Penny's got nothing to do...

438
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:58,533
注意立场 Amy
Careful, Amy.

439
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:02,301
我敌人女朋友的朋友也是我的敌人
The friend of my enemy's girlfriend is my enemy.

440
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:03,201
真的?
Really?

441
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:04,401
嗯
Yes.

442
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:05,934
要么站我这边 要么对立一面
You're either with me or against me.

443
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,134
你想做公交去上班?
You want to take the bus to work?

444
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,234
也许还有第三种选择
Maybe there's a third option.

445
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:16,834
顺带一提 早餐我还吃了甜甜圈
FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.

446
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,834
所以我们只需要等待那些船上
So now we're just waiting for the data

447
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,234
获取的数据分析结果
from the ship to be crunched,

448
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,867
但看上去结果很不错
but the numbers look pretty promising.

449
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,167
那挺好的
That's so great.

450
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,167
如果你们能证明盎鲁效应...
If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation...

451
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,267
喂 喂!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

452
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:31,767
我眼睛在这儿
My eyes are up here.

453
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,633
嘿 Howard 你好 Raj
Howard, Raj.

454
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:37,334
犹大
Judas.

455
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,633
你知道吗?
You know what?

456
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,167
你是个疯子
You're a crazy person.

457
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,401
一个记忆力很好的疯子
A crazy person with a long memory,

458
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:46,334
如果再发展的话 就能生产出机器军队了
and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.

459
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:48,368
别说了
Stop it.

460
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:49,667
或者变异人部队
Or a mutant army.

461
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,167
要看创始人怎么想了
It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.

462
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,633
别说了!
I said, stop it!

463
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,067
听我说
Now, listen to me.

464
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:01,533
你们不只是朋友
You two aren't just friends.

465
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,368
你们是挚交
You're best friends.

466
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:06,234
这是多么美好阿
And that's a beautiful thing.

467
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:12,034
Leonard 你知道他为什么生气吗?
I mean, Leonard, you know why he's so mad at you?

468
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,767
因为他很想念你!
It's 'cause he missed you!

469
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,401
还有 作为朋友
Yeah, and as his friend,

470
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:18,167
你应该感到高兴
you should be happy

471
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:21,401
因为他还有着爱心
he has love in his life.

472
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:23,167
像我一样
As I do.

473
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:27,401
他昨天深深的抚摸着我的胸部
This man held my breast the other day,

474
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:29,134
我很爱他
and I love him for it.

475
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,900
声音太大了 哥们
A little loud, dude.

476
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:39,334
那么 我们能否放下过去的那些不愉快
So, can we please put aside these petty differences

477
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:42,368
然后高兴我们又重新在一起了呢?
and just be glad we're here together?

478
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,034
我想可以吧
Okay. I suppose so.

479
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:49,867
谢谢
Thank you.

480
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,762
不是什么变态的事情
Uh, it wasn't anything weird.

481
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:54,082
只是想知道他胸部到底多大
It was just to see how big they were.

482
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,827
然后Leonard带我去理发和看牙医
And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist,

483
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:08,647
然后愉快美好的一天
and then to cap off the perfect day,

484
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,802
就在参观洛杉矶度量局后结束
the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.

485
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:16,012
我一开始觉得是主要讲"度"的
I thought the measures were going to be the stars

486
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,173
结果其实是讲"量"的
of the show; turns out it was the weights.

487
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,763
我真高兴你们重归于好
I'm so glad you guys are friends again.

488
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:24,659
也高兴能和你重归于好
And I'm glad you and I are friends again, too.

489
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:27,161
这倒提醒我
Aw. Which reminds me.

490
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:28,904
这是我邮箱里的 送给你
This came in the mail, and I want you to have it

491
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:31,080
"5毛钱卫生巾打折卡"
"50 cents off Vagisil."

492
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,644
用的时候记得我
Think of me when you apply it.

493
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:42,615
我说一句 其实我挺怀念我们一起玩耍的时候
Uh, can I just say, I've missed all of us hanging out together.

494
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:44,148
- 是  - 我也是
- Yeah.  - Me, too.

495
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:48,589
他啥时候能不用酒壮胆就在女生面前说话的?
Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?

496
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:50,577
在你离开不久的时候
Oh, that happened right after you left.

497
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,225
没人和我说过?
And no one told me?

498
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,839
我们居然忘记和他说了
Can't believe we forgot to tell him.

499
00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:00,039
用的时候想着Sheldon
Think of Sheldon when you apply it.

500
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:10,039
(译者对tweepadock的解释: tweep是Twitter和Peeps的合成 指玩twitter的人 喜欢所有事都晒出来 Dock代指阴茎 有个笑话是大象的鼻子是阴茎 所以Amy用tweepadock代指了大象而且把私处都放鼻子上了 也指事情坦白了说 所以Sheldon说大象猜对了)
