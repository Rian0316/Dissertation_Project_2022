1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,530
Earl 我发现你还活着呢
Earl, I noticed you're still alive.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,080
有什么秘诀吗?
What's your secret?

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,120
嗯 其实这要归功于我积极的生活态度
Well, it's my positive attitude,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,570
一点好基因
a little bit of genetics,

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,470
还有懂得如何照顾自己的身体
and knowing how to take care of your body.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,580
我用荷荷葩
I use jojoba.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,740
那是啥玩意儿 类似于乳液?
What is that, like a lotion?

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,460
不 其实是一个叫荷葩的小姐
No, it's a ho named hoba.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,300
她每个礼拜来一次
She comes over once a week.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,650
Max 有人给你快递了个包裹到家里
Max, you just got box delivered at home.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,000
我可不想要什么大包裹了
I don't want another box.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
这个已经够我受的了
I got my hands full with this one.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,140
以前我家里一天到晚收快递
I used to have so many packages delivered to my house,

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,390
我爸为了省钱把把联邦快递都给买了下来
My dad had to buy Fedex just to save money.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,340
我记得在邮件被发明之前
I remember a time before mail.

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,480
你什么都拿不到
You just didn't get stuff.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,150
不 我不要
Nope. I don't want that.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,000
这是我妈给的
It's a delivery from my mother.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,850
我妈只给过我生命
The last thing she delivered was me,

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,440
让我到现在还在收拾这烂摊子
and I'm still cleaning up that mess.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,690
你难道不好奇她给你送了什么吗?
Aren't you at least curious what she sent?

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,020
除非这是一个崭新的童年
Unless it's a brand new childhood,

23
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,660
我不感兴趣
I'm not interested.

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,500
Earl 拿着Max的"大包裹"吧
Here, Earl, hold Max's box.

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,170
我可是把她像女儿那样对待啊
But she's like a daughter to me.

26
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,040
Caroline 你看 我把我的鱼缸带来了
Look, Caroline, I brought in my fish tank,

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,010
Max说它是我的奥林匹克规格的游泳池
Which Max has been calling my Olympic-size swimming pool.

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,680
Han 看到了吧 海平面上的世界大不一样
See, Han? The world's different above sea-level.

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,050
过来 打个招呼
Now, come over here and say hello.

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,890
我现在要跟小鱼打招呼?
I'm saying hello to fish now?

31
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,270
我已经沦落到这地步了?
That's where I'm at?

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,730
你也是 Max
You too, Max.

33
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,890
我想让我的餐馆见人来见见我的小鱼家人
I want my diner family to meet my fish family.

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,530
我有个阿姨水喝得跟鱼一样多
I got an aunt that drinks like a fish.

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,400
也许她就在这里面
Maybe she's in there.

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,700
才不会 她因为开车撞死人进了监狱
Oh, no, she's in jail for vehicular manslaughter.

37
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,620
来享受一下我的爱的生态系统吧
Please enjoy my ecosystem of love.

38
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,740
不要敲玻璃!
Never tap on the glass!

39
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,710
看看你那肉嘟嘟的爪子
Just look at that meaty paw of yours.

40
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,800
这对它们还说就像是地震
It's like an earthquake to them.

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
哦 这是我的奖品
Oh, there's my prize.

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,920
这条是皇家蓝吊鱼
The royal blue tang fish.

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
五百美元
$500.

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,060
Han 你去找人给你吹箫我并不意外
Han, I'm not surprised you have to pay for blue tang,

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,390
但五百美元似乎太贵了
but $500 seems high.

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,650
嘿 Han 我那个小姐只要25美元
Hey Han, jojoba'll do it for 25.

47
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,070
好吧 我希望你的鱼在这里能过得开心
Well, I hope your fish will be very happy here.

48
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,570
其他人在这都不开心 不过谁知道这鱼呢
I mean, no one else is, but who knows.

49
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,740
我们走 Max
Let's go, Max.

52
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,870
Oleg把连姆·尼森的女儿给绑架了吗
Did Oleg take Liam Neeson's daughter?

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,790
我正在和全部女朋友分手呢
I'm breaking up with all my ladies

54
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,260
这样我才能和Sophie重新开始
so I can start up again with Sophie.

55
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,960
可是这个Oksana不肯屈服
And Oksana's not taking it lying down,

56
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,130
或是像她从前那样俯低身子
or bent over like she usually is.

57
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,430
好吧 可惜我没见到她
Well, I'm sorry I never got to meet her.

58
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,130
就告诉她你和Sophie已经决定...
Just tell her that you and Sophie have decided to be...

59
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,940
在乌克兰语里"一夫一妻制"怎么说?
What's the Ukrainian word for "monogamy"?

60
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,770
没这个词
There isn't one.

61
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,020
你要么丑得没人要 要么睡遍天下
You're either ugly or you're sleeping with everyone.

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
绝对不行 不行
Uh-uh. No way.

63
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,140
把它留在外面
Leave it out here.

64
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,260
让拆弹部队去处理它
Let the bomb-squad figure it out.

65
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,600
你难道不想知道她送你了什么吗?
Don't you wanna know what she sent you?

66
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,900
可能那里面有钱
Maybe there's money in there.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,910
所以你就打算把它留在走道上
So you're just gonna leave it out in the hall

68
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,740
就像留给客房服务处理的垃圾?
like a room service tray?

69
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,940
哦 天啊 我曾经有客房服务
Oh, my god, I used to have room service.

70
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,610
哦 天啊 我曾经有自己的房间
Oh, my god, I used to have a room.

71
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,780
好吧 我可不希望它在我公寓里
Well, I don't want it in the apartment.

72
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,250
这是一个充满正能量的地方
This is a place of positive energy and good vibes.

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,340
我明天把它送回去
I'm sending it back to her tomorrow.

74
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,350
直到我被随便埋葬的那一天
I will go to my shallow, unmarked grave

75
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,960
我都不要知道这包裹里有什么
not knowing what's in that box.

76
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,270
嘿 Max 你门外有个箱子
Hey, Max, you got a box out here,

77
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,310
里面还有只小熊呢!
and there's a bear in it!

78
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,310
哦 天啊
Oh, my god.

79
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,690
她还留着那个?
She kept that?

80
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,310
我妈怎么还留着那个?
How did my mom ever keep that?

81
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,450
她连她的牙齿都保不住
She can't even keep her teeth.

82
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,780
箱子里就这个?
That's what was in the box?

83
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,620
一个泰迪熊玩偶?
A teddy ruxpin doll?

84
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,040
你在发霉熊网注册了?
Are you registered at mustybears.com?

85
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
这不是一个玩偶 他有自己名字的
Not a doll and not his name.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,830
我把它的名字正式改为T-rux
I had it legally changed T-rux.

87
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,660
我用的是我妈的那个律师
I used the same lawyer my mom hired

88
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,830
他说只要我宣称是印第安人
to declare me native american so she didn't have to pay

89
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,630
那么她就不用付赌场的停车费
for parking at the casino.

90
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,500
六个月来 我接电话时都得称自己为
For six months, I had to answer the phone,

91
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,000
麦克斯·光荣脚
"Max Proudfoot."

92
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,180
你知道吗 在波兰 我们没有玩偶
You know, in Poland, we didn't have dolls.

93
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,510
我们就雇佣一些吉普赛孩子
Yeah, we just hired little gypsy kids

94
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,510
然后带着他们到处跑
and we carried them around.

95
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,650
对了c  我的那个叫Gurgio
Yeah, mine was called Gurgio.

96
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,400
而且 我觉得他有小儿麻痹症
Yeah, and I think uh, he had a little bit of polio.

97
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,240
嘿 这种东西不会说话吗?
Hey, didn't those things talk?

98
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,490
如果给它装上四个栅偏压电池就会说话了
They did if you had four "c" batteries.

99
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,530
等等 我觉得我好像有这号电池
Wait, I think I have some.

100
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,250
是的 这只可爱的泰迪熊
Yup, they came with this adorable teddy bear

101
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,700
本身自带有会唱歌的磁盘
singing cassette, so of course,

102
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,700
不过我把它砸了 然后自己给安装了一个
I smashed that with a rock and made my own.

103
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,840
我的Gurgio不会说话
Yeah, my Gurgio didn't talk.

104
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,040
我都不知道他有没有舌头
I'm not sure he had a tongue.

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,550
但他总是紧紧地抓着我
But he used to squeeze me really tight.

106
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,380
后来我发现 他已经35岁了
And then I found out later, he was 35.

107
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,390
你床头柜里有四个栅偏压电池?
You had four "c" batteries in your nightstand?

108
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,810
从啥玩意抠出来的啊
From what?

109
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,120
你到底想不想听这只熊说话
Do you wanna hear the bear talk or don't you?

110
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,710
哦 女孩们 对不起啦
Oh, I'm sorry, girls.

111
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,410
我得接这个电话
I gotta take this.

112
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,050
这是另一个我要分手的男人
It's another guy that I'm breaking it off with.

113
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,580
我希望Oleg值得我这么做
I sure hope Oleg's worth it.

114
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,720
我刚刚甩了一个多重人格的男人
I just dumped a guy with multiple personalities.

115
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,800
于是他的三个反应是 没问题
Yeah, and he took it okay,

116
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,560
不太好
and not great,

117
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,480
以及很伤心
and pretty bad.

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,760
里面连张纸条也没有
There's no note or anything.

119
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,820
这就是个让人失望的包裹
This box is really just a well of disappointment.

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,440
你妈妈为啥要寄这个给你?
Why would your mother send you this?

121
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,570
她做事哪有为啥?
Why would she do anything?

122
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,860
你说她为啥咬我家的狗?
Why would she bite our dog?

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,330
还和我家的南瓜灯亲热?
Why would she make out with our jack o'lantern?

124
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,000
我哪知道
I don't know.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,750
Max 在这么多年之后 她把你最爱的
Well, Max, she did send you your favorite toy

126
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,120
玩具寄给了你
after all these years.

127
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,450
说不定她想做出补偿呢
Maybe she's trying to make amends.

128
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,950
做出补偿?
Oh, make amends?

129
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,340
她连个三明治也做不出来
She couldn't even make me a sandwich.

130
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,420
准备好了?
Okay, you ready?

131
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,290
我知道你是 但我呢?
I know you are, but what am I?

132
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,430
哦 天啊 Max 那是你吗?
Oh, my god. Max, is that you?

133
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,300
那是小Max的声音吗?
Is that your little Max voice?

134
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,770
小心点 我准备放臭屁啦
Careful, I'm about to open up a can of whoop ass.

135
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,310
就是你! 那时你几岁了?
It is you! How old were you there?

136
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,020
十岁 "臭屁"是我那会儿的口头禅
Ten. "whoop ass" was kind of my thing.

137
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,830
现在也是
Still is.

138
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,310
我当然知道你也有童年
I mean, I guess I always knew you were a little kid once,

139
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,360
但直到听到你的声音我才想象得到
But I couldn't picture it till I heard that.

140
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,700
就好比我从来想象不到自己
Like I couldn't picture me eating fruit

141
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,780
有一天会从加油站拿水果吃一样
From an Exxon station till I did that.

142
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,910
你们准备好点单了吗?
So, are you two ready to order?

143
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,080
嗯 我要火鸡三明治配薯条
Oh, yeah. I'll have the turkey club with fries.

144
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,040
这就是你没人要的原因 Rita
This is why you're single, Rita.

145
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,540
我有人要的 我嫁给你爸爸了
I'm not single. I'm married to your father.

146
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,540
我爱你 但不要把你的生活方式强灌给我
I love you, but stop pushing your lifestyle in my face.

147
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,510
我要一份沙拉 配上蘸酱
I'll have the salad. Dressing on the side.

148
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,260
显然的么
Obvs.

149
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,550
显然的啦 显然
Obvs, obvs.

150
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,610
我要把T-rux寄回给我妈
Well, I'm sending T-rux back to my mother.

151
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,110
我在Han办公室里找到的空箱子
He's going right into this empty box

152
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,390
正好装得下它
I found in Han's office.

153
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,230
Max 你寄回去之前
And Max, before you send it back,

154
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,230
先把电池还给我
I'm gonna need those batteries.

155
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,730
哦 别担心 我没兴趣看你
Oh, don't worry, I have no desire to see you

156
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,980
和震动奶昔机玩抱抱
hugging the milkshake machine.

157
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,960
哦... 我的... 天啊!
Oh... my... god!

158
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,380
那只是华斯比泰迪熊吗?
Is that a teddy ruxpin doll?

159
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,910
Rita 我想要!
Rita, I want that!

160
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,710
你刚过完生日 Elliot
Your birthday just passed, Elliot.

161
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,220
可我的出柜派对就快到了
But my coming out party is coming up.

162
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,640
那是什么 女孩成人礼之类的?
What is that, like a queen-ceanera?

163
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,540
真婊 我喜欢她
So bitchy. Love her.

164
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,310
一只旧华斯比泰迪熊差不多值500美元
A vintage teddy ruxpin is worth like, $500,

165
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,600
我妈妈有工作 所以她得花钱买我的爱
And my mom works, so she has to buy my love.

166
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,600
再多嘴 我就取消你的水疗日
One more word, and I'm taking away spa day.

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,490
真残酷 亲爱的
That's harsh, honey.

168
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,270
他对90年代特别着迷
He's obsessed with the '90s.

169
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,070
那会儿你还没出生呢
But you weren't even born.

170
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,610
我知道 都怪她
I know. I blame her.

171
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,080
直到人老珠黄才找到男人
She couldn't find a man till late in life.

172
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,110
美甲也取消掉了
There go the pedicures.

173
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,570
凉鞋穿不了咯
There go my sandals.

174
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,120
虽然我挺喜欢看真人版"威尔和格蕾丝"
As much as I love watching Will and Grace,

175
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,120
{\an8}"威尔和格蕾丝", 1998年美剧, 其中男主角为同性恋, 女主角为异性恋

176
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,790
但这只熊不卖
this guy's not for sale.

177
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,680
我得把它寄回我妈妈那儿
I'm sending him back to my mother's place,

178
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,840
根据罗德岛假释处的记录
which, according to the Rhode Island parole office,

179
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,850
位于必乐透杂货店外面的一个纸板房
is a cardboard shanty town outside of big lots.

180
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,520
这是我的名片
Well, here's my card.

181
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,810
面对现实吧 你看着就像是及需五百美元
And let's face it, you look like you could use $500.

182
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,980
真婊 我喜欢他!
So bitchy. Love him!

183
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,120
刚刚一个幼版的基佬安德森·库珀
I was just offered $500 for T-rux

184
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,950
想用500美元买我的T-rux
from baby anderson cooper.

185
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,470
他还有名片?
He has cards?

186
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,820
我居然嫉妒一个九岁的孩子?
I'm jealous of a nine-year-old?

187
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,540
我都沦落到啥地步了?
That's where I'm at?

188
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,160
嘿 虽然我很想要这500美元
Hey, as much as I would like that $500,

189
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
可我绝不能让我妈妈以为
my mother doesn't get to think this bear

190
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,500
靠一只熊就能弥补我的童年
gets to make up for my childhood.

191
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,170
才不能这么便宜了她
She doesn't get off that easy.

192
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,470
相信我 我们俩曾经在一张沙发上睡了9个月
Trust me, we shared a pullout couch for nine months.

193
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,560
姑娘们 能过来一下吗?
Girls, can I see you over here?

194
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,840
简直不敢相信我又要去和鱼说话了
I can't believe we have to talk to the fish again.

195
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,430
简直不敢相信Max竟然还没把Han按进鱼缸里
I can't believe Max hasn't put Han in the tank yet.

196
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,520
Max和Caroline 今天开始每个晚上
Max, Caroline, every night from now on,

197
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,350
我都要你们用网兜清扫水面
I need you to move the skimmer along the top of the water

198
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,990
撇取漂浮物
and take out the floating matter.

199
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,740
Han 自从被迫清扫老人用过的便池后
Han, you know I'm off diner poop patrol for life

200
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,190
我就再也不干餐厅粪便清扫员的活了吧
after I had to clean the booth where the senior left...

201
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,950
打扫那种像烂透了的桨果
Well, we'll just call it an elderberry.

202
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,700
好吧 Caroline Max不肯 所以归你了
Well, Caroline, Max said no, so you have to do it.

203
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,040
Han 一走到鱼缸边你就成了大佬
Han, you're kind of a baller around your fish.

204
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,420
好吧 我速战速决
All right, I'm gonna do this fast.

205
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,210
冲进去冲出来...
Get in and get out...

206
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,090
就和上次浴室里有鸟一样
Same thing I do when that bird is in our shower.

207
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,260
拿一下 Max
Pick up, Max.

208
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,880
我打来是想告诉你 我和别人一起了
Look, I'm calling to tell you I met somebody else

209
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,600
所以我和你分手了
so I'm breaking up with you.

210
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,440
现在把电话给你妈妈 我和她也要分手
Now put your mother on. I'm breaking up with her too.

211
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,840
简直不敢相信
I can't believe this.

212
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,560
我现在成了鱼的海滨服务生
I'm a cabana boy for fish.

213
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,770
这回我能在简历的"最高法院实习生"下面
I guess now I can add "fish poop remover"

214
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,900
加上"鱼粪清洁工"这一条了
to my resume next to "supreme court intern."

215
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,570
最后那一下好像舀出了一条鱼
I feel like there was a fish in that last one.

216
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,080
没错
Yup.

217
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,250
哦 天啊 是贵的那条!
Oh, no, it's the expensive one!

218
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,960
真是我的一贯风格
That's so me.

219
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,630
我真没想到能在你30岁前
I really didn't expect to see you digging through garbage

220
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,220
看到你翻垃圾
till you were 30.

221
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,050
哦! 啊! 它还活着!
Oh! Ah! Ugh! It's still alive!

222
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,060
我得让它保持湿润
I need to keep her wet.

223
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,890
哦 被金枪鱼糊了一身 肯定得有皮肉伤了
Oh, covered in tuna, that's gotta be traumatic for it.

224
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,320
我感觉它好像滑下下水道了
I feel like it went down the drain.

225
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,770
这是个意外 我发誓
It was an accident. I swear.

226
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,320
我喜欢鱼 我绝不会伤害它们
I love fish. I would never hurt one.

227
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,910
除非你算上吃寿司 因为我会吃得
Unless you count eating sushi, 'cause then I'm like

228
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,610
比开膛手杰克杀人还凶残
Jack the Ripper.

229
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,750
Caroline 一切都还好吗?
Caroline, are things going swimmingly?

230
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,780
杰克 他在和你说话呢
Jack, he's talking to you.

231
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,120
呃  哦 是的 一切都好
Uh, oh, yeah. Swimmingly.

232
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,670
特别是蓝色那条
Especially the blue one.

233
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,500
它躲进自己的小房子里了
He went in his little house.

234
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,590
它不想让其他小伙伴
He doesn't like to use the restroom

235
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,590
看到它在上厕所
In front of his friends.

236
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,960
是啊 我和它很有共同点的
Yeah, we're a lot alike.

237
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,420
谢谢您这么快接见我们
Thank you so much for seeing us so quickly.

238
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,630
没事 你们先在这等着
Sure, you guys can just wait in here.

239
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,800
Elliot正在做普拉提 快结束了
Elliot's finishing up with his pilates.

240
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,610
给你们提个醒
Do yourselves a favor.

241
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,510
记得赞他的核心肌群相当紧实
Tell him his core looks tight.

242
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,200
马克思 对不起 害你要卖掉T-rux小熊
Max, I'm so sorry you have to sell T-rux

243
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
帮我凑钱买鱼
For the fish money because of me.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,370
生气中 直接看拳吧
Talked to the fist, because the face is pissed.

245
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,790
连熊都敢给我脸色?
I'm getting attitude from a bear?

246
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,830
我已经沦落到这种地步了?
That's where I'm at?

247
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,300
他有这么多90年代的东西 太神奇了
I can't believe all this stuff he has from the '90s.

248
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,470
他出柜都要开派对 我也是醉了
I can't believe he has to have a party to come out.

249
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,500
这娃先出生 再出柜
That kid came out, out.

250
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,560
我猜他连脐带都是古驰的
His umbilical cord is a gucci belt

251
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,210
哦... 看看这些玩具!
Oh...t hese toys!

252

不过你懂得 我那时候彩虹还没什么政治意义
But, you know, a time before rainbows became political.

254
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,800
天啊 天啊

255
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,680

一个真人比例的芭比!
A my size barbie!

257
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,850
我曾经坐拥十个
I had ten of these.

258
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,660
不是拿来玩 是以防遇到绑架之际
Not to play with, they were used as decoys

259
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,860
可以用它们来当替身 迷惑坏人
In case of a hostage situation.

260
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,330
现在你已经被人生绑架了
And now your whole life's a hostage situation.

261
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,700
对不起 来迟了
Sorry I'm late.

聊橘郡男孩里的贵妇的真实生活

264
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,040
你的核心肌群看起来好紧实
Your core looks really good.

265
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,370
我知道 亲
I know, honey.

266
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,190
我先找我的支票本 你们跟奥尔森姐妹说说话
Now while I get my check book, say hello to the Olsens.

You got a lot of toys.

268
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,600
我在与你相仿的年纪之时 只有这个
When I was a girl your age, I only had this.

269
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120
我可不可以和真人芭比玩
I don't suppose I could play with my size barbie

270
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,350
那么一下下
For a second.

271
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,760
你的脸上写着"不行 贱人"
I feel like that's a "no, bitch."

272
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,220
不... 不只是玩具
I'm not... I'm not just talking about the toys.

273
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,440
整个房间的布置都很漂亮
You got a pretty sweet set-up.

274
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,860
你想要什么 外面的那个好心阿姨都会给你
That nice lady out there, giving you everything you want,

275
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,360
照顾你
Taking care of you.

276
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,730
就是个妈妈 大家都有
She's just a mom. Everyone has one.

277
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,790
也不一定 有人只有超酷的小熊
Not really. Some people just have bad ass bears.

278
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,870
Max 你确定吗?
Max, are you sure about this?

279
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,210
这是你童年的唯一纪念

也是童年纪念
From a ball-peen hammer.

282
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,080
自此我再也不敢在观看
The last time I change the channel

283
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,090
"三人行"的时候换台了
During Three's company.

284
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,640
我们动作快点好吗?
Can we fast forward this to me having the bear

285
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,420
把熊卖给我 你们就可以走了
And you two leaving?

286
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,060
好的 拿去吧 没关系
Okay, just take it, it doesn't matter.

287
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,890
不行 Max 怎么会没关系
No, Max. It does matter.

288
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
这熊不能卖
We're not selling this.

289
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,610
他的玩具够多了
He has enough toys.

290
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,270
我是说 人家好像摸摸那个真人芭比
I mean, all I wanted to do was touch the life-size barbie.

291
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,930
好的 我知道现在是个什么节奏了
Okay, I see what's happening.

292
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,270
我买豆豆娃娃的时候也遇到过这种情况
I've been down this road with the beanie babies.

293
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,570
我出六百块
I'll give you 600 for the bear.

294
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,740
卖了
Sold.

295
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,740
不可以 Max! 那熊是你的童年啊
No, max! That's your childhood.

296
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,770
- 七百  - 成交!
- 700.  - Sold!

297
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,160
不行 Max！
No, Max!

298
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,080
Caroline 我的童年不值七百
Caroline, my childhood is not worth $700.

299
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,910
我妈妈最多给过我四十块
The most my mother ever got for me was 40 bucks

300
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,750
加上一个能量杯
And a big gulp.

301
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,440
但是熊里面住着一个小小的你啊 Max
But that's "little you" in there, Max.

302
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,000
她是无价的
And she's priceless.

303
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,310
这小姑娘绝对会把声音洗掉 
And she's about to erased and taped over

304
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,290
用来录冰雪奇缘的原声
by the soundtrack from frozen.

305
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,620
冰雪奇缘?
Frozen?

306
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,500
你当我谁啊? 去年的我吗?
Who am I? Me, a year ago?

307
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,600
不行 不卖
No. Can't have her.

308
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,800
好吧 那另外一个孩子要怎么应付?
Well, what are we gonna do now about the other child?

309
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,320
餐馆里那个老小孩
The one in the diner?

310
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,270
我想他也该长大了
Well, I guess he's just gonna have to grow up.

311
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,800
长大? 你觉得 他要是有那能力
Grow up? You think if he had that ability,

312
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,980
会留着不用吗?
He wouldn't have used it yet?

313
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,360
所以... 熊不卖了?
So what... No bear?

314
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
拜托 你会遇到自己生命中的"熊抱"
Oh, please! You'll have a bear in your life.

315
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,430
信姐没错
Trust me.

316
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,450
好吧 Max
All right, Max.

317
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,660
你会帮我告诉他 是不是?
You're gonna help me tell him, right?

318
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,280
你喜欢告诉他坏消息
You like giving him bad news.

319
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,450
不 我只喜欢告诉他短小
No, I like giving him bad news about how he's short

320
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,450
头又大的坏消息
and has a big head.

321
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,760
你懂的 那种好笑的坏消息
You know, fun bad news.

322
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,340
我要宣布一个振奋人心的消息!
Exciting news!

323
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,290
我给鱼鱼买了房房
I got the fishies a new house!

324
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,010
是丧失赎回权的抵押品 好便宜的
I got it cheap. It was a foreclosure.

325
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,180
嗯 Han 你能过来吗 我跟你说句话
Uh, Han, can we talk to you over there

326
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,270
去卡座说... 最远的那个?
In the booth... The far booth?

327
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,640
可以稍等吗? 我要把房子放到鱼鱼的公寓里
Can it wait? I want to put in the new condo

328
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,020
这样Max就不会管我叫恶房东了
So Max will stop calling me a slum lord.

329
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,770
哦 这个不急啊 
Oh, that can wait, I mean, those fish

330
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,280
这些鱼又不会到处乱跑
Aren't going anywhere.

331
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,760
除了那只蓝色的 它绝对
Except for the blue one, who's definitely playing

332
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,980
是在玩什么诡异的躲猫猫游戏
Some kind of twisted game of hide and seek.

333
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,650
是啊 它超爱那个小房子的
Oh, yeah, he loves that little house.

334
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,200
那这个它一定会更喜欢
He's going to love this one even more.

335
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,820
Max 你可以过来陪我吗?
Max, can you join me?

336
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,490
人家在端盘子 好忙的
I'm pretty busy waiting on tables right now.

337
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,870
好了 现在是什么情况?
Okay, what's going on?

338
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,460
Max这辈子就从来没正经端过盘子
Max has never waited on a table in her life.

339
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,160
Max 我需要你 快过来
Max, I need you over here.

340
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,170
人家正在端烤奶酪
I'm just putting down this grilled cheese

341
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,050
再不端 就冷了
'Cause I don't want it to get cold.

342
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,140
我这会儿要吓尿了!
Now I'm freaking out!

343
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,870
Max 不要这样对我
Max, don't do this to me.

344
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,170
我知道你把那些尸体都埋在哪里的 真的
I know where the bodies are buried, literally.

345
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,140
我每六个月都会挪一次
I move them every six months.

346
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,530
好了 是什么事?
Well, what is it?

347
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,680
Han 人的一生总会碰上一些事情
Han, sometimes in life, things happen

348
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,650
一些不如意的事情
That you don't want to happen.

349
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,070
没错
Yes.

350
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,650
即使很难面对 但你要知道
And even though it's hard, you know,

351
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,690
你还是不得不面对
You just have to face up to it.

352
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,190
应该是吧
I suppose.

353
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,080
天啊 真不容易
Oh, dear god, this is rough.

354
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,350
那个...
And, well...

355
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,030
Han 我真的不想跟你说这事
Han, I don't wanna have to tell you this,

356
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,540
我知道这是你最不想听到的事情...
I know this is the last thing you ever want to hear...

357
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,870
快说吧!
Oh, just say it!

358
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,180
卫生棉机器又坏了
The tampon machine is broken again.

359
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,210
我等会儿会戴上眼罩去把它修好
Later, I'll get my blindfold and fix it.

360
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,880
想听建议吗?
Word of advice?

361
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,220
如果你最终真的把我杀了
When you do finally kill me,

362
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,720
你要在警察面前摆出一副不正经的样子
You gotta work on your game face for the cops.

363
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,050
Max 别这样
Max, please.

364
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,720
我没法对Han说我弄死了他的鱼
I can't tell Han I murdered his fish.

365
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
我说不出口
I can't.

366
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,020
我也说不出口
Well, I can't tell him either.

367
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,890
别争了 我去跟他说
Oh, hell, I'll tell him.

368
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,700
我是个黑人 大家总会以为是我干的
I'm a black man, everyone already assumes I did it.

369
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,400
谢谢 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you so much.

370
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,200
这不过是条鱼 他会没事的
It's just a fish. He'll be fine.

371
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,900
我决定待会儿在小蓝鱼的生日派对上
I've decided I'll give blue the new house

372
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,540
送它一间新房子
at its birthday party later.

373
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,710
今天是那条鱼的生日?
It's the damn fish's birthday?

374
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,800
我不干了
I'm out.

375
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,080
你们都被邀请了
And you're all invited.

376
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,800
小蓝鱼今天两周岁了
Blue's two years old today.

377
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,620
它们通常活不了那么久
They don't usually live that long.

378
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,310
对 确实活不了
No, they do not.

379
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,760
看他这样 我们怎么说得出口
That's it, we can't tell him.

380
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,480
虽然我猜Han的年纪
Even at Han's age, which I am guessing

381
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,430
是在14到53岁之间
is somewhere between 14 and 53,

382
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,650
但有些孩子还没准备好长大
Some kids just aren't ready to grow up.

383
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,940
我们要怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

384
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,920
我们应该跑出去 买条新的
We're gonna run out and buy a new one.

385
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,160
我们去哪儿弄钱?
Where are we gonna get the money?

386
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Oleg 你还记得两年前
Oleg, you know how two years ago

387
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
你付一千美元让我给你按背吗?
you offered me $1,000 for a back rub?

388
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,500
当然
Of course.

389
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,120
Caroline给你按背 只收五百
Caroline will do it for $500.

390
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,620
成交 最后的狂欢
Deal. One last hurrah.

391
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,170
隔着衣服 只按腰部以上
Over the clothes, above the waist,

392
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,620
虽然说不上理由 但你必须穿避孕套
And I don't know why, but you have to wear a condom.

393
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,430
没错 请找Dominic Rosello神父
Yes, father Dominic Rosello, please.

394
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,800
他正在庆祝弥撒?
Oh, he's celebrating mass?

395
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,520
好吧 你能不能告诉他Sophie Kachinski
Oh yeah, could you just tell him that Sophie Kachinski

396
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,440
正向一夫一妻转变?
is converting to monogamy?

397
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,450
她不能再跪倒他的圣坛前面了
And uh, she won't be kneeling at his altar anymore.

398
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,100
对 就这么说 他会明白的
Oh, yeah, yeah, he'll understand.

399
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,990
Han在哪儿 他知道了吗?
Where's Han and does he know?

400
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,320
不知道 但我没办法继续假装我还看见那条鱼
No, but I can't keep pretending I see that fish.

401
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,330
我有青光眼又整天抽嗨了
I'm a pot-head with a touch of glaucoma.

402
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,710
我看见不存在的东西
I'm seeing stuff that's not there.

403
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,210
却看不见存在的东西
Not seeing stuff that's there

404
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,800
我都糊涂了
It's confusing.

405
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,170
好吧 过来
Okay. Come on, come on.

406
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,000
放进去 放进去
Put it in, put it in, put it in.

407
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,950
我对每一个跟你约会过的人
I have a whole new respect for every guy

408
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,510
产生了新的敬意
that's ever gone out with you.

409
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,890
生日快乐 小蓝鱼!
Happy birthday, blue!

410
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:47,980
生日快乐 小蓝鱼
Happy birthday. Happy birthday, blue.

411
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,060
小蓝鱼在哪儿?
Where's blue?

412
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,350
我一整天都没看见它
I haven't seen her all day.

413
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,350
我刚刚看见了
I just saw it.

414
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,990
对 它肯定在那里
Yeah, it was definitely there.

415
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,520
难道你不给蛋糕拍个照
You're not gonna give blue that cupcake

416
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,360
就直接给小蓝鱼? 你的平板电脑呢?
without a photo-op, are you? Where's your ipad?

417
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,530
我刚刚看见了 没错 它肯定在那里
I just saw it. Yeah, it was definitely there.

418
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,860
是啊 Han 去拿平板!
Yeah, Han, go!

419
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,860
你需要拍张照 这样你就能放上脸书
You need a pic so you can post it on facebook

420
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,200
或者鱼书之类的
or fishbook or whatever.

421
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,700
好主意 给你 拿着蛋糕
Good idea. Here, hold this.

422
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
嘿 Caroline 你看起来没那么平了
Hey, Caroline, you look less flat.

423
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,510
你终于去做了隆胸手术了?
You finally get that boob job you needed?

424
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,210
我觉得是袋子破了
I feel like the baggy broke.

425
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,220
对 你用便宜填充物的话就会这样
Yup, that's what happens when you get the cheap implants.

426
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,200
天啊 真的有东西
Oh, my god, there is definitely something

427
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,940
在我胸罩里动
moving around in my bra.

428
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,360
你还认得这种感觉 也算是件好事
Well, it's good you can still recognize that feeling.

429
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,560
没错... 哦! 哦! 我摸到了!
It's right... Oh! Oh! I touched it!

430
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,940
真恶心!
Gross!

431
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,110
来人把手伸进我的胸罩来帮我啊
Someone, put your hand in my bra and help me.

432
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,950
为啥是现在? 现在我已经不干这行了!
Why now? Now that I'm off the market!

433
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,730
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

434
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,290
我怕我会把它挤扁然后又弄死了
I'm afraid I'm gonna squish it and kill it again.

435
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,070
好了 直接爬上柜台 把它倒进鱼缸里
Okay, just get up on the counter and drop it in the tank.

436
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,540
什么?
What?

437
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,960
爬上柜台 打开你的腿
Get up on the counter, spread your legs,

438
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,580
然后让它直接掉进缸里
And just let it fall into the tank.

439
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,250
你知道吗?
You know what?

440
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,060
把擦背的事忘了 做完这个 我们就扯平了
Forget the back rub. After this, we're square.

441
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,260
好了 在鱼缸上叉开腿 拉起你的工作服
Okay, straddle the tank, pull out your uniform,

442
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,210
然后让它去吧
And let it go.

443
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,360
现在我欠你钱了
Now I owe you money.

444
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
直接在鱼缸上蹲下 就像你正在生
Just squat over the tank like you're delivering

445
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,070
一条鱼宝宝
A fish baby.

446
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,110
我在生鱼宝宝?
I'm delivering a fish baby?

447
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,410
我已经沦落到这种地步了?
This is where I'm at?

448
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,910
别说话了 你已经走到这地步了
Stop asking. That's where you're at.

449
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,740
好了 现在我确实看见了 对吗?
Okay, now that I saw, right?

450
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,840
Caroline 下来!
Caroline, get down!

451
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,210
这不是那种派对
It's not that kind of party.

452
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,850
Max 你真的还要把T-rux送回去?
Max, you're really still gonna send t-rux back?

453
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,440
在我们被一个小孩用
After we got bullied by a kid

454
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,940
蒂凡妮·西森的枕头欺辱之后?
with a Tiffani Amber Thiessen pillow?

455
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,190
别紧张 T-rux还在收银台那里
Relax, T-rux is right over there by the register.

456
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,950
对了 他是我们的第一个员工
And by the way, he's our first employee.

457
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,320
一旦我们遇到挑事儿的顾客 它就会说
Anytime we get a bone-head customer, he can say,

458
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,700
"看拳吧...
"talk to the fist...

459
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,990
因为正在生气中"
'cause the face is pissed."

460
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,990
我就是给我妈妈寄了一些东西
I'm just sending my mother something

461
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,860
感谢她在我的童年时期
to say thank you for everything she gave me

462
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,190
给予我的一切
when I was a child.

463
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,240
那里面有什么?
Aww, what's in there?

464
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,190
啥都没有!
Nothing!
