1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,055
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:05,785
The police showed me your rap sheet.
You killed a man.

3
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:06,932
You want to hear what happened or not?

4
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:10,908
It doesn't matter, because I will never believe
anything you say ever again.

5
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:12,967
Sometimes unexpected visitors...

6
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:15,266
- Do you think she's cheating on you?
- I think so.

7
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:17,437
I'll take care of it.
Thank you, mama.

8
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:19,878
Lead to unexpected consequences.

9
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:22,860
Andrew, you almost killed another human being.

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,057
She's lived her life. I have my whole life ahead of me,

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,230
And now it might be screwed up.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,620
In the coma ward at sacred heart hospital,

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,060
The dreams begin just after midnight.

14
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:45,894
The pitch black of night gives way to vivid images

15
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:48,272
That comfort the dreamer until the morning.

16
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:55,246
Gus the custodian dreams of someday
winning the lottery

17
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,709
And quitting his thankless job.

18
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:08,031
Howard, the security guard visions
a luxurious retirement in the tropics

19
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:15,723
Ruthanne the night nurse
fantasizes about leaving her husband

20
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:25,071
But the most vivid dreams of all
belong to the patient in room 312

21
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,104
Yes, Juanita Solis had been dreaming steadily
for five months.

22
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:36,915
Sometimes of the shocking secret she had uncovered

23
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:40,835
Other times...

24
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,827
She dreamt of the accident that had put her
in the hospital

25
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:49,297
But her most common dream

26
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:55,299
Was the one in which she finally told her son the truth.

27
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,453
Gabrielle...

28
00:01:58,032 --> 00:01:59,633
And then one night,

29
00:02:00,164 --> 00:02:05,395
Juanita Solis decided it was time
to wake up

30
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:12,441
Ahem, hello?

31
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:15,891
Is anybody here?

32
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:20,291
Hello?

33
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:26,976
Have to call my son!

34
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:06,722
Even though she knew she was about to die,

35
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,157
Juanita didn't care.

36
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,165
The truth was finally going to come out.

37
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:14,929
Tell my son his wife is cheating on him.

38
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:16,292
Oh, my god.

39
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,371
Sadly for Juanita,

40
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:21,558
This was one dream that would
never come true.

41
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,129
What? What?

42
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,262
Aw. Aw.

43
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:12,386
We all honor heroes for different reasons.

44
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:17,452
Sometimes for their bravery, sometimes for their daring,

45
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:20,321
Sometimes for their goodness.

46
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:24,810
But mostly we honor heroes

47
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:27,725
Because at one point or another,

48
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,830
We all dream of being rescued.

49
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,241
Susan, I know you're in there
We got to talk

50
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:41,925
This is crazy.

51
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:44,230
I know.

52
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:52,543
Everything the cop said to you is true.

53
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:53,520
I did kill somebody

54
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:55,479
But there's one thing they didn't tell you.

55
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,466
I killed for you, Susan.

56
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:06,859
Susan, if I can't have you,

57
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:07,619
No one else can.

58
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:09,527
Shut up!

59
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,394
Susan, you home?

60
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:26,780
Susan, your car is here.

61
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:27,623
I know you're in there.

62
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:31,420
I was hoping

63
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:32,517
We could talk for a minute.

64
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:44,382
Susan, maybe you should have waited till I left

65
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:45,014
To do that.

66
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,901
All right, look, I know you don't
want to see me right now

67
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:50,349
But I owe you an explanation,

68
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,886
And it's all in there -- All of it

69
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:54,340
Everything you ever wanted to know about my past,

70
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:56,028
About the reasons for doing what I did

71
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,769
It's all there.

72
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:18,572
Hey

73
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,360
Guys, come on.
What are you doing?

74
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,441
Uh... You know, just bonding,

75
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:27,854
Discussing current event

76
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:29,667
Hey, seriously,

77
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:32,404
Listen, if you guys would have just parked across the street,
I could have let you go

78
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:34,757
So why don't yout pretend like we did?

79
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:37,050
Get out of the car.

80
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:42,332
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop the car!

81
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,244
Hey! Hey! Hey!

82
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:48,795
I can't believe it

83
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:51,419
Too much from graduation he get expelled

84
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:55,458
You know, we are just lucky that
security guard did not press charges

85
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:59,533
- So what are we gonna do?
- Well... I'm glad that you asked

86
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:05,977
What are these?

87
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,450
They are brochures for youth detention centers

88
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,535
How long have you had these?

89
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,343
Had been in the drawer for few months,
I have a feeling...

90
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:19,188
- We might be needing 'em
- Bree... I don't know

91
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,329
We have to admit that we need help

92
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:24,855
If we can't get through it Andrew,
then we have to find someone who can

93
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:27,458
You really want to send our son to
some prison camp?

94
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,642
Oh, come on.
Don't be so dramatic.

95
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:30,647
I mean someone places actually look fun

96
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,178
Look -- Camp Hennessy.

97
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:38,698
Camp hennessy teaches kids "Respect for authority
and boundaries in a summer camp-like atmosphere."

98
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,766
The perimeter is surrounded by an electrified fence.

99
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:45,590
Well, you have to admit, that's an efficient way
to teach respect for boundaries

100
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:50,059
Okay, how about this one? It’s perfect for Andrew.

101
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:51,602
It's a ranch in Montana.

102
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:54,656
It has lots of fresh air and plenty of open spaces

103
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,632
And daily classes on anger management.

104
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:58,195
I'm -- I'm not comfortable with this.

105
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,103
All right, how about this one?

106
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,102
It's in the desert, and it's very reasonable.

107
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:04,021
Barracks area little bit bleak,

108
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:07,328
But that recidivism rate is to die for.

109
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:10,806
Bree, I'm not doing it. I'm not sending my son away.

110
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:12,919
It's easy for you, isn’t it?

111
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:15,063
You're not the one he’s openly rude to.

112
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,562
You're not the one he challenges every day.

113
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:19,784
You're not the one he hates.

114
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,633
I'll talk to him, all right?

115
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:25,659
I'll sit him down for a little old-fashioned heart-to-heart.

116
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:28,508
You talk to him all you want.

117
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:30,995
I'm going to check out the place with the electrified fence.

118
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:38,236
Listen, my children, and you shall hear

119
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:40,762
in the midnight ride of Paul revere.

120
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,306
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch

121
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,984
Of the north church tower.

122
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:49,354
One if by land, two if by sea,

123
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,976
And I on the opposite shore will be.

124
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:58,672
Um, hi.

125
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:01,843
I wanted to introduce myself to your mom.
I'm Lynette Scavo.

126
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:04,444
Hi, Lynette. I'm Alias Stevens.

127
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:07,285
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought --No, no. I read lips.

128
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:08,426
Oh.

129
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:12,312
But a lot of the time, signing is just easier.

130
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:15,496
I don't like to misunderstand or to be misunderstood.

131
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,231
- And I'm Lily.
- Oh, hi.

132
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:20,121
- Nice to meet you, Lily.
- Hi, mom

133
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:21,315
That's my son Matt.

134
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,242
My twins talk about Matt all the time.

135
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,809
We should set up a play date.

136
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:25,894
That sounds great.

137
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:27,194
Let's have dinner, too.

138
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:28,549
I'd love to.

139
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:29,475
The British are coming!

140
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:31,739
- They are coming! The British are coming!
- Get him! Get him! Get him!

141
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,389
Even better, let’s just keep it adults.

142
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:38,209
Babe, they blinked.

143
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:40,549
We got 'emby the short hairs.

144
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,580
Who? Who blinked?

145
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,810
The D.A.

146
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,840
I just spoke with the lawyers.
They offered a plea bargain.

147
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,294
And that's good?

148
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,370
It means they know they got a weak case.

149
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,062
They don't think they can win.

150
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,288
It's over.

151
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:54,121
Oh, my god.

152
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:56,297
Honey, that means we can keep the house.

153
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:58,090
No, we still have to sell the house.

154
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,806
I got to pay the lawyers.

155
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:02,024
But I thought you said they offered a plea bargain.

156
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,493
Yeah, but we're not going to take that.

157
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,408
Put me down.

158
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,017
Honey...

159
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,301
It would mean me going to jailor eight months.

160
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:12,148
I think that’s pretty reasonable,

161
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:13,800
Considering you’re guilty as sin.

162
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,427
You said that you were fine with selling the house.

163
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:18,504
That was before I knew we could trade
a couple of months in prison to keep it

164
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:21,132
What?

165
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,399
No, this is her daughter-In-Law.

166
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,542
Is it the hospital?

167
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:27,205
Is it mama?

168
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:34,120
Uh...

169
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:35,700
Thank you. Yes.

170
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:39,528
Gabby?

171
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:41,717
I'm sorry, Carlos.

172
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,200
Some believe people are judged
by the way they live life

173
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,369
And others by the way they leave it.

174
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,387
I like the Lexington mahogany with gold leaf.

175
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,935
Comes with a pink velvetinrior and drapes.

176
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:09,533
Plus, it's hand-Engraved,

177
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:11,394
So in case of a flood or earthquake,

178
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,093
They'll at least be able to know which one is hers.

179
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,372
Don't you think that’s little over the top?

180
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:17,905
Only the best for mama.

181
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,526
No, honey, these funeral homes make a fortune

182
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,277
Trying to convince people to overspend.

183
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:23,665
What are you saying?

184
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,439
Well, I'm saying your mother was a sensible woman.

185
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:28,272
She wouldn't be comfortable withal these bells and whistles.

186
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,136
Maybe this one --Wood veneer.

187
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,011
What? You never liked mama.

188
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,220
Well, it's awfully hard to like someone

189
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,564
Who actively hates your guts.

190
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:42,021
She always thought you married beneath you,

191
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:42,943
And she let me know it.

192
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:43,742
She loved you.

193
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,023
She treated me like trash.

194
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:46,936
God rest her soul.

195
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:48,629
I'm putting my mother in the grave.

196
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:50,769
Now is not the time to pinch pennies.

197
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:54,060
Carlos, we're not exactly flush with cash right now.

198
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:55,756
Let her be true to her roots.

199
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:59,218
She was born humble and barefoot.

200
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:02,049
She was a queen.

201
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,671
So what did Mike say when he gave you the letter?

202
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,243
That it explains everything.

203
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:12,077
Well, does it? I haven't read it.

204
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:14,096
Well, why the hell not? I just can’t.

205
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:15,381
You're a better woman than me.

206
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:17,223
I would have ripped that open with my teeth.

207
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:19,285
Aren't you dying to know what he wrote?

208
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,544
Yes. But what if it's just bunch of farfetched stories?

209
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,442
Well, you should assume that it is.

210
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:25,308
Why?

211
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,121
Well, think about how good men are
at lying on the spot

212
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,584
I mean, god forbid you should give them time and a pen.

213
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:32,105
Ha ha ha ha ha.

214
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:35,895
Hey, Edie, you mindstopping by the site later?

215
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,461
I have blueprintsof the master bath.

216
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,611
Oh, I'll see you in a few, Bill

217
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:48,916
It's my new contractor.We're sort of dating.

218
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:52,315
Didn't you once say you never mix business with pleasure?

219
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:55,926
No, I said never mix pleasure with commitment.

220
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:56,837
Right.

221
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:59,696
So, Susan, what are you going to do with the letter?

222
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:01,731
And for Pete's sake, would you open it up already?

223
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:05,216
No.

224
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:06,318
No, I won't.

225
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,389
I don't trust Mike anymore, and without trust --

226
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,476
No, no. I'm just going to go in

227
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,840
And rip it up and throw it in the trash.

228
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,307
Why wait? Why don't we just rip it up now?

229
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:16,982
No, no, no, no.Uh, that's okay.

230
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,105
I don't want to, you know, litter.

231
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,882
She is so opening that letter.

232
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:32,636
While Carlos was making arrangements
to bury his mother,

233
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:37,273
Gabrielle was making sure she'd be taking her secret
to the grave

234
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:41,519
Hi, I'm Gabrielle Solis and nurse Heisel

235
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:45,764
yes, hi when you called and said you were coming down,

236
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:48,065
I, uh, collected all the personal things

237
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:49,039
That your husband brought in

238
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,916
During juanita's, uh, stay with us.

239
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:54,222
I assume that that's why you're stopping by.

240
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,374
Oh, that's so thoughtful of you, but, actually, no.

241
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:00,302
No?

242
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:04,747
No, you see, my husband and is till don't 
have a clear account

243
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:06,994
As to how Juanita passed.

244
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,407
How?

245
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:13,361
Yes. Did she die quietly, in her sleep

246
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:15,358
Uh, yeah, that's usually how it happens.

247
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,141
I mean, I'm pretty sure that that's how it happened.

248
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:20,910
Pretty sure.

249
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:22,861
I mean, I don't know it exactly,

250
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:24,925
Because I wasn't with her at that time.

251
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:26,879
Uh-Huh.

252
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,265
Was anyone with her?

253
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:35,200
An orderly, candy striper --Anyone.

254
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,029
No.

255
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:40,422
She was alone.

256
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:47,374
Thank you so much. That's all I needed to hear.

257
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,472
Oh, Mrs. Solis.

258
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:54,720
Oh, you can just toss that.

259
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:09,466
Great. Just great.

260
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:18,453
I think this is yours.

261
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:21,058
Yeah.

262
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:23,650
Yeah, I've been looking for this one.

263
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:25,388
Thanks.

264
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,350
I don't suppose you have any idea
where I found it

265
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:31,786
Well, those little suckers are drawn to bare feet
and car tires,

266
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:34,306
And since you're not limping or bleeding...

267
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,934
This is only temporary. You're going to need
to take this tire into get it fixed

268
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:40,772
Thanks. I will.

269
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,541
Seriously,it's not safe.

270
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:44,744
You're probably only going to get 20, 30 miles out of it.

271
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:45,910
All right, I promise.

272
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:47,663
Hey, listen --

273
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:50,461
I'm about to break for lunch. How would you like to join me?

274
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:51,453
Lunch?

275
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:52,618
Yeah. Lunch.

276
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,392
Are you asking me out on a date?

277
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:58,651
That sounds kind of formal

278
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,238
For a burrito and a can of soda,

279
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:02,403
But, yeah, I guess I am.

280
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:04,817
Aren't you dating Edie?

281
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:07,237
We went out on a date.We're not dating.

282
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:08,431
Oh.

283
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:10,468
So how about it? I'm buying.

284
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:12,662
Yeah, I just got out of this relationship

285
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,265
With this guy Mike, and it's kind of complicated --

286
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:19,164
Anyway, I'm just not even sure
where I am right now emotionally

287
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:20,562
I'm just all jumbled up,

288
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,665
And I don't think I can leap right into something new

289
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,122
Relationship-Wise, you know, at the moment.

290
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,625
Again, just a burrito.

291
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:27,919
Ha ha.

292
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:29,294
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:29,683 --> 00:16:30,832
Okay, I understand.

294
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:33,568
Sounds like you need a little time to reflect and heal.

295
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,031
I do. I really do.

296
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:35,605
Okay.

297
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:37,900
I'll check back with you again tomorrow.

298
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:43,270
This is so delicious.

299
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:46,503
I don't know how you find the time with four kids.

300
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,356
Only for first-time guests.

301
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:50,725
Normally you'd be having chicken fingers

302
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,636
And cartoon-shaped macaroni.

303
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:53,481
If that.

304
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,330
Hey. Shut up.

305
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:58,918
Tom, you're in advertising, right?

306
00:16:59,094 --> 00:16:59,480
Mm-Hmm.

307
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,413
I worked five years at simon and scott.

308
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:05,794
I started at simon and scott.

309
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,990
Ha ha ha ha.

310
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:08,654
I hated those guys.

311
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,129
Ha ha ha.

312
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:12,151
We have to talk.

313
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:15,455
So who do you --Do you know that...

314
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,437
Well, it's all over now.

315
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,335
They'll be talking shop for the rest of the night.

316
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,930
Alisa loves talking about alias.

317
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:25,299
Well, Lynette loves talking about Lynette, too.

318
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:26,699
Oh, I don't believe that for a second.

319
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:29,452
You and your husband seem pretty solid.

320
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:32,478
We're going through some tough stuff.

321
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:34,487
We're, um, in counseling.

322
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,105
Oh, really? More steak?

323
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,428
It was her idea.

324
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:41,820
It's not the most pleasant way to spend an hour.

325
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,048
Basically, I look at the clock

326
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:45,558
And she blames me for everything.

327
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,796
I don't think you should be talking about alias
with her...

328
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:50,662
So...

329
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,561
It's okay. It's not like she can hear.

330
00:17:57,263 --> 00:17:59,340
Maybe I'll have some more of that, uh, potato stuff.

331
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:03,008
He actually said those things

332
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:04,309
With her just sitting right there.

333
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,275
It was really nasty,

334
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:07,621
And he wouldn't shut up, either.

335
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:10,012
I can't believe you said we'd play tennis with them.

336
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,522
Honey, that was before I knew that he was a jerk.

337
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:13,603
She was great.

338
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:15,117
Look --Look what she taught me.

339
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:18,398
Means "I love you."

340
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:21,889
Yeah, that's great. What am I going to do?

341
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:24,663
What do you mean?

342
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,447
Well, obviously, she needs to be told.

343
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,080
No, no, no, no, she doesn't.

344
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:29,940
This is between dennis and alias.

345
00:18:30,358 --> 00:18:31,647
How can I ignore this?

346
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:33,657
And I quote, "it's not like she can hear."

347
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,198
Lynette, you're starting to ramp up

348
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:38,263
Into that whole meddling thing that you do.

349
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,440
Excuse me?

350
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:41,671
Let me just handle it. Let's avoid a big thing.

351
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:44,446
Are you saying I can't be tactful?

352
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:44,740
You know what?

353
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,495
If he says something when we play tennis,

354
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,253
I will take him aside man to man
And say,"that's not cool."

355
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,202
Are you saying I'm not tactful?

356
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,172
Ow. Ow, ow, ow.

357
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,078
Andrew, I need you to take out the trash.

358
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:14,934
Sure.

359
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:18,095
Now, not five hours from now.

360
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:19,502
I'm going,

361
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,945
I'm going. God.

362
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,705
Um, I'm meeting justin at the mall tonight,

363
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:27,826
So I'm going to need 40 bucks.

364
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:28,876
No.

365
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:30,464
What?

366
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,214
You no longer get an allowance.

367
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,997
Fine. I'm not taking out the trash.

368
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,289
Andrew.

369
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:39,593
What are you going to do,

370
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:40,191
Torture me?

371
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,783
Go ahead. I can take it.

372
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:43,820
What I want,

373
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,562
What I have always wanted,

374
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,710
Is for you to be happy.

375
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:50,214
And you're not, and I have
no idea how to help you.

376
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:53,446
Well, you can start by getting out of the way.

377
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,514
I will not. We're going to talk about this now.

378
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,938
I said get out of the way.

379
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,434
The next time you touch

380
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:05,172
Your mother like that,

381
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,443
I'm going to throw you throug this wall

382
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:07,871
You understand me?

383
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:33,385
Oh, Edie, wait up.

384
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:34,887
I-I want to ask you something.

385
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,107
I can't stop. I've got to keep 
my heart rate up.

386
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,047
I was just wondering
how you'd feel

387
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:40,333
If I went out with Bill.

388
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:42,518
What?

389
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:44,498
Um, Bill asked me out.

390
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:46,437
Bill? My Bill?

391
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,316
Well, see,

392
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:48,040
That's the thing --

393
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:49,355
He doesn't think of himself

394
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,349
As your Bill,

395
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,551
'Cause he said that date
was just a one-Time thing.

396
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,413
Which I know because

397
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,549
When he asked me out,

398
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:57,560
I told him I thought
you guys were involved.

399
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,426
So you haven't agreed
to go out with him.

400
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,324
No. No, I wanted to check with you first.

401
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,622
Wow, that was nice of you.

402
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:06,493
So can I?

403
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:07,852
No.

404
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:09,665
Edie.

405
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:11,763
Edie, why can't i go out with him?

406
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:13,573
Because I saw him first.

407
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:14,864
Ha ha.

408
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,888
Come on, that's a really
third grade thing to say.

409
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:19,148
Look, you asked my permission.

410
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:19,821
I said no.

411
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:20,883
That should be the end of it.

412
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,592
Well, you know, technically,
I don't need your permission.

413
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:28,372
You know, I so much

414
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,421
Want to like you,

415
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,652
- But you won't just let me
- Edie...

416
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:34,097
Susan, you know, I try.

417
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:36,746
I try to look past your flaws --

418
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:38,107
Your klutziness,

419
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:38,740
That --

420
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,804
That faux vulnerability,

421
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:41,946
Your hair.

422
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:44,345
But you look for ways

423
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:45,549
To push my buttons.

424
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:48,365
He just wants to buy me a burrito.

425
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:50,040
Susan, please,

426
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:51,590
Let me like you.

427
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:54,403
Okay.

428
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:56,120
I won't go out with him.

429
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,025
I mean, obviously,
you have feelings for him.

430
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:00,776
No, I don't.

431
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:02,077
I really don't.

432
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,271
So what, then?

433
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:05,472
If you can't have him,

434
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:06,236
Nobody can?

435
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:08,211
See?

436
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,285
Now you're thinking like a friend.

437
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:19,806
Ave maria

438
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:24,726
- Gratia plena
- What a voice.

439
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:26,961
You have to hand it to Gabrielle and Carlos

440
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:28,526
They do grief better than anyone.

441
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:34,243
Gratia plena

442
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:36,483
So how much did that horse and buggy set us back?

443
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:39,131
- Do you mind?
- Being poor? A little.

444
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:42,224
Eyes front, padre.

445
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:51,786
I can't believe Edie.

446
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:54,599
She doesn't have dibs on every man 
on the planet.

447
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:55,999
If I want to go out with Bill,

448
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:57,037
I should be able to.

449
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,203
I thought you weren't even into him.

450
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:00,170
Well, neither is she,

451
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:01,897
And if she's not into him,

452
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:03,191
Why can't I not be into him?

453
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:06,678
I'm going to mourn now.

454
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,968
What's going on?
Why are we slowing down?

455
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:15,344
Because we're almost there.

456
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:21,731
What is that?

457
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:24,206
The family who owned it
couldn't afford the maintenance payment.

458
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,196
I got an amazing deal.

459
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,916
A crypt? You bought your mother a crypt?

460
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:28,427
Keep quiet.

461
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,462
You're making a scene.

462
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:30,441
Oh, that's it.

463
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,652
I cannot be a part of this.

464
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,911
I can't do it.

465
00:23:34,477 --> 00:23:35,070
Gabrielle.

466
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,694
Stop acting like a child.

467
00:23:43,461 --> 00:23:46,106
A-Are we supposed to be following them?

468
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,987
I don't know. I mean, maybe it's part of the ritual.

469
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,464
Go to hell, Carlos.

470
00:23:53,785 --> 00:23:55,062
All right, people,

471
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,427
We're going to follow the body.

472
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:57,300
This way, please.

473
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,115
Come along.

474
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:00,804
This is too much.

475
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:02,690
The only reason I agreed to give up the house

476
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,857
Was because I thought

477
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,435
I was going to get a gorgeous little apartment.

478
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:07,108
Now I'm not even going to get that.

479
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:08,782
What do you want me to do?

480
00:24:09,242 --> 00:24:10,156
Take the plea.

481
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:11,376
What?

482
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:12,748
Yeah. You did the crime.

483
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:14,175
Why should I have to pay the price?

484
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:15,784
Just suck it up, be a man,

485
00:24:15,982 --> 00:24:16,689
And do the time.

486
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,029
Gabby, you're being ridiculous.

487
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,068
Am I? All I want

488
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:21,217
Is the same respect

489
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:22,324
That you gave your dead mother.

490
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:22,997
Gabby, please.

491
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,043
At least she's going to have
a roof over her head.

492
00:24:33,998 --> 00:24:34,625
15-All.

493
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:42,288
Oh. Was that in?

494
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:44,029
Ha ha ha.Ha ha ha.

495
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:44,519
Nice try.

496
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,113
God, Alisa,you're deaf, not blind.

497
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:50,377
It was a close call.

498
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:52,859
That's telling him.

499
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:54,884
I'm waiting for my moment.

500
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:57,983
You think her tennis stinks,you should try her cooking.

501
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:03,265
15-30.

502
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:10,283
Sorry.

503
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:15,522
I should have mentioned that my tennis is much 
betterthan my cooking.

504
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:21,943
- Hey.
- Hey.

505
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,145
That was fun. You play really well.

506
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,043
Thank you. Give me a break.

507
00:25:26,078 --> 00:25:27,533
She serves underhand, for god's sake.

508
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:36,954
- What's your problem? 
- Excuse me?

509
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:38,839
Hey, do you have any bottled water over there?

510
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,344
Because my electrolytes get all wacky when I sweat.

511
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:45,198
She's your wife.

512
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:46,518
How can you talk about her like that?

513
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:48,153
Let me tell you what saint alias is saying

514
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,751
With that phony smile plastered on her face.

515
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:52,964
"Move your ass, dennis."

516
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,101
"Nice love handles, dennis."

517
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,663
"Try switching your deodorant, dennis."

518
00:25:57,901 --> 00:26:00,111
All right, enough. If you've got issues
with your wife, tell her

519
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:01,981
We're in counseling.

520
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:02,271
Yeah, well,

521
00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:04,901
It's not working too well if you have to unload
on a perfect stranger, is it?

522
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:07,781
If you're unhappy in your marriage, 
do something instead of just complaining,

523
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,185
'Cause, frankly, I don't want to hear it.

524
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:12,848
Hey, let's trade partners.

525
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,032
Great.

526
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:17,271
Thanks.

527
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:20,055
I'll play with you.

528
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:23,353
Hey.

529
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:25,152
Hey.

530
00:26:25,962 --> 00:26:26,922
You did not take this in.

531
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:28,894
This should hold, but...

532
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:31,005
You've got to take it in.

533
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:32,455
Thank you. I know. I'm going to.

534
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,184
I-It's on the top of my list.

535
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:35,764
Whoo.

536
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:37,932
That was hard work.

537
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,562
Would you likea glass of water

538
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:42,987
And maybe an excuse to come in and talk to me?

539
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:44,721
Ha ha. That sounds great.

540
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:49,683
So it's tomorrow.

541
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:52,108
I told you I'd check back inon that date.

542
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,513
Bill, um...

543
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:56,743
I have my reasons.

544
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:01,225
Am I hideous?

545
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,753
Oh, god, no.

546
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:07,116
No, you are just so incredibly
not hideous.

547
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:08,021
Thank you.

548
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:09,388
I think.

549
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,983
See, now, maybe it's the word "date"

550
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:13,042
That's throwing me off.

551
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:15,168
Look, I just want to have some fun.

552
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:16,869
You know, dinner, drinks.

553
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:20,798
No strings attached.

554
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,559
Okay, I'll go out with you.

555
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:30,863
Great. I know this little place, out of the way.

556
00:27:31,014 --> 00:27:31,717
You're going to love it.

557
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:39,271
Whatcha doing?

558
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,798
Making an emergency list for you

559
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,789
So you'll know who to call in case the roof leaks

560
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:47,332
- Or the power goes out.
- Why?

561
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,410
I'm taking the plea bargain.

562
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:54,159
So you can keep the house.

563
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:01,251
When I buried my mother, I did it with respect,

564
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,275
And I don't regret a single penny,

565
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,397
But I'm the one that got us into the position
that we're in,

566
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:11,076
And the moment I did, I stopped respecting you.

567
00:28:15,288 --> 00:28:16,167
And that's not right.

568
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:18,255
You are so brave.

569
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:23,795
It's not without strings.

570
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:29,999
I need you to promise me that you're going to be here

571
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:30,673
When I get out.

572
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:33,041
Well, that's a ridiculous thing to say.

573
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:34,102
I'm not going anywhere.

574
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:35,378
And I need you to promise me

575
00:28:35,606 --> 00:28:36,967
That you'll be faithful while I'm gone.

576
00:28:38,892 --> 00:28:40,185
Yeah. Of course.

577
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:42,407
Gabrielle, I'm no fool.

578
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,157
You're a beautiful woman,

579
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,425
And I understand that you have needs.

580
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:50,762
But I'm a very jealous and possessive man,

581
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:53,440
And I need to hear you say it.

582
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:56,683
I promise.

583
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,083
Okay, then.

584
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:03,479
Tomorrow morning, we'll go and see the lawyers.

585
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:06,258
I love you.

586
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,511
I love you, too.

587
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,503
And just so you know...

588
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:24,582
I'm going to hold you to that promise.

589
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:33,536
What's going on?

590
00:29:35,003 --> 00:29:35,663
Did grandma die?

591
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:37,448
Uh, no, she's fine.

592
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:39,168
Listen, Andrew...

593
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:41,688
Sweetheart, it's been clear to us

594
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,590
For some time now that you've been unhappy.

595
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:45,371
All this acting out...

596
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:47,366
The pot smoking, the violence...

597
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:51,761
It just isn't you,and we feel that you need
to spend some quality time

598
00:29:52,164 --> 00:29:53,940
Thinking about the goals in your life

599
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,411
And what kind of person you want to be.

600
00:29:58,317 --> 00:29:59,943
What the hell are you talking about?

601
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:04,568
There's this place called camp hennessy.

602
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:07,103
It's designed for teenagers like yourself

603
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,165
Who have lost their way,

604
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:10,335
And --You got to be kidding me.

605
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:12,804
They emphasize discipline and responsibility --

606
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,011
Two things you're sorely in need of.

607
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:18,058
Hopefully you won't have to be there
for more than a few weeks.

608
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:21,771
You can stop this now. I'm not going
to any stupid campfor juvenile delinquents

609
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:26,763
We're ready.

610
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:28,874
I'm sorry, honey,but you don't have a choice.

611
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:41,232
Get your hands off of me!

612
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:43,567
Andrew, andrew, it's no use fighting.

613
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,187
Now, these gentlemen are going to help you get dressed,

614
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:46,762
And then they're going to drive you to the camp.

615
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:47,702
We can take it from here.

616
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:51,179
Wait, wait. Mom, mom, wait.

617
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:52,316
Please, I'm sorry, mom.Please.

618
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:53,845
Honey, it's going to be okay, I promise.

619
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:57,371
I know this was your idea.

620
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,003
- Why, you little --
- Rex, stop it.

621
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:01,773
Honey...

622
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,899
No matter what you say or do,

623
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:05,818
I will always love you.

624
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:09,544
Let's go. Come on.

625
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:16,580
What's that for?

626
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:19,268
For being here.

627
00:31:21,944 --> 00:31:23,338
For standing by me through this.

628
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,508
You don't know what it means to me, rex.

629
00:31:29,374 --> 00:31:32,431
A long time since I felt like I had a real partner.

630
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:34,592
And it really helps,

631
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,831
Especially on a horrible morning like this.

632
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:49,233
- Hey, Alisa. 
- Hey, lily. How are you guys?

633
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:51,432
May I speak to you, please?

634
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:54,044
Um, sure.Boys, here.

635
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,698
Stay right there.

636
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:56,600
Yes, mom.

637
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:00,261
So how are you?

638
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:01,366
Dennis left me.

639
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:02,770
What?

640
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:05,700
Dennis left me.

641
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:06,455
Why?

642
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:08,949
You told him to, you moron.

643
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,482
- I'm sorry, what?
- You talked to my husband about my marriage.

644
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:12,828
That's none of ur business!

645
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,745
Alisa, stop. I can't understand you.

646
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:16,667
You're going to have to talk slower.

647
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:18,005
Okay.

648
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,984
Dennis says you yelled at him

649
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:33,961
For saying stuff behind my back.

650
00:32:35,627 --> 00:32:36,074
Well, yeah.

651
00:32:37,183 --> 00:32:38,826
And he said you told him

652
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:40,918
Our counseling wasn't working.

653
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,804
Yes, that's not exactly what I --

654
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,369
Where the hell do you come off

655
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:47,418
Telling people to stop going to counseling?

656
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,169
I didn't mean that you --

657
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:51,549
Sure, we have our share of problems --

658
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:55,038
Financial, emotional, sexual --

659
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:57,793
But we were solving them.

660
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:01,403
Alisa, come here.

661
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,328
Are you sure

662
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,119
You want to be...

663
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:11,687
Saying these things in front of your daughter?

664
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,954
Now you're telling me how to raise my daughter?

665
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:16,701
Lily, we're coming back.

666
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:17,438
Ahem.

667
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:19,559
Alisa...

668
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,271
I am so sorry if I caused a problem.

669
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:25,025
I just wanted to help.

670
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:27,380
Why? Why do you want to help?

671
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:29,503
Well, because of the --

672
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:30,820
Oh, because I was deaf?

673
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:33,785
No, because your husband was being a total jerk.

674
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:39,847
And you just got to come in on your white horse

675
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:42,900
And come to the rescue. Well, guess what --

676
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:45,397
I didn't need to be rescued. Got that?

677
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:47,166
I didn't need to be rescued.

678
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:54,486
Bitch.

679
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,485
Uh, she said...

680
00:33:58,748 --> 00:34:00,344
Yes, thank you. I know what she just said.

681
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:06,818
I mean, one minute, we're making out in his truck,

682
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,773
And the next thing I know, we're at the hospital,

683
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,371
And the doctor's digging a bullet out of him.

684
00:34:11,198 --> 00:34:13,462
It's just that when I started dating Mike,

685
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:15,400
He seemed like such a normal guy, you know?

686
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,605
They always do.

687
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:18,577
You want to get some nachos?

688
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,948
I mean, obviously, I am not going to read the letter.

689
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:23,011
At some point, you just got to let it go, right?

690
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:26,811
Right. You mind if we leave off the jalapeÑos?

691
00:34:27,057 --> 00:34:28,362
I'm not so good with spicy things.

692
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,089
I don't mean to be babbling. It's just really complicated,

693
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:33,419
And there is so much about Mike you don't even know.

694
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,435
That would surprise me at this point.

695
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:41,747
Edie.

696
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:42,862
Your foreman said

697
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,173
That you were out on a date with a hottie.

698
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:46,551
Evidently, someone's in need of lasik.

699
00:34:47,516 --> 00:34:48,480
You tracked us down?

700
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:50,351
Well, it wasn't hard.

701
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,713
I just followed the stench of betrayal.

702
00:34:54,518 --> 00:34:55,398
We had an agreement, Susan.

703
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,395
No, we didn't.

704
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,654
You know, I just said what you wanted to hear

705
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,125
Because you guilted me into it.

706
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:03,459
I was trying to protect our already fragile friendship.

707
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:04,933
Am I in the middle of something here?

708
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:05,705
Not anymore.

709
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,964
You ... I will hate forever.

710
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:11,792
And you are fired.

711
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:12,960
Edie.

712
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,455
You're firing me because I'm going out with Susan?

713
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:18,050
Yes, and before you start whining

714
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:19,908
That dating her is punishment enough,

715
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:21,269
Save it.

716
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:32,348
I suppose I could tell heryou threw yourself at me.

717
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,767
You were lonely, you begged to have dinner,

718
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:35,558
And I took pity on you.

719
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:37,388
Well, excuse me, but that --

720
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:39,293
That kind of makes it sound like it was my fault.

721
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:44,307
You can't possibly blame me.I'm not the one who fired you.

722
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:46,069
Right. You just chose not to tell me

723
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:48,452
That Edie would be insanely mad if I went out with you.

724
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,525
Slow down.You're driving too fast.

725
00:35:50,778 --> 00:35:52,389
You know, this is between you and Edie.

726
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:54,557
I just got sucked into the drama.

727
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:56,527
Yeah, I bet you tell yourself that all the time.

728
00:35:57,341 --> 00:35:57,929
What does that mean?

729
00:35:58,462 --> 00:35:59,897
You didn't get sucked into the drama.

730
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:01,251
You invited it in.

731
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:02,059
That's not true.

732
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:05,435
You spend the last hour obsessing over your ex-Boyfriend

733
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:07,495
Even though he's a sketchy ex-Con

734
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:09,678
Who very possibly strangled your neighbor.

735
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:10,682
Well, no, he didn't.

736
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,989
And Edie told you not to go out with me,

737
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,359
But did you listen? No.

738
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:16,465
'Cause you saw the potential for disaster,

739
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:18,388
And you just couldn't resist getting in there.

740
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:20,335
Okay, mr. Let's-Just-Have-Fun-

741
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:22,604
'Cause-I'm-The-Charming-Casual-Contractor man.

742
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:25,226
You chased me, so own it, my friend.

743
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,040
U didn't get that tire fixed, did you?

744
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:48,171
I was meaning to.

745
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,684
I guess I do invite the drama in...

746
00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:55,134
Just a little.

747
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:04,055
- Stocks closed up yesterday...
- Tom, am I a bad person?

748
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,709
Dow jones industrial average was up 30 to --

749
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:11,186
No. Why would you say that?

750
00:37:12,582 --> 00:37:14,756
I don't know. I guess I just have it in my head

751
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:16,785
That only bad people break up marriages

752
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:18,281
And offend the handicapped.

753
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:21,653
I did try to warn you.

754
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:22,200
You did.

755
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:24,317
Why do I do it?

756
00:37:25,797 --> 00:37:27,940
This compulsion to stick my nose

757
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:29,300
Where it doesn't belong.

758
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,269
Honey, you're just looking out for your friend.

759
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:34,124
Yeah, a lot of goodit did her.

760
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:36,428
Hey, at least you tried.

761
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:38,130
I admire you for that.

762
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:39,413
Oh, please.

763
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,000
Hey, you know,

764
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:43,297
I'm the guy who let dennis badmouth his wife

765
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:46,538
- And you let him have it. 
- That's me --

766
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,465
I'm never afraid to create a scene.

767
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:52,415
Hey, honey, look --My point is

768
00:37:52,685 --> 00:37:54,609
You have a strong sense of what is right,

769
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:56,475
And you're not afraid to act on it.

770
00:37:57,648 --> 00:37:59,054
And I admire you for that.

771
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:01,956
You know what I admire you for?

772
00:38:03,944 --> 00:38:06,232
You find a way to compliment me

773
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:08,532
When you could say "I told you so."

774
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,113
You just signed "I told you so", didn't you?

775
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,541
You'll never prove it.

776
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,615
Thanks for coming in, Mrs. Solis.

777
00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:31,661
I believe you've met nurse Heisel.

778
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:33,955
Yes. Hello -- Again.

779
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,582
Nurse heisel became quite attached

780
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:39,890
To your mother-In-Law.

781
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:41,367
That's why I asked her to be here for this.

782
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:44,400
First of all, I want you to understand

783
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:46,262
That we consider our commitment to our patients

784
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:47,438
A sacred trust.

785
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:52,406
Okay.

786
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,107
Having said that,

787
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,650
It appears there may --And I stress "may" --

788
00:38:58,147 --> 00:38:59,993
Have been a breakdown in our chain of care.

789
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:03,625
I can assure you that we hold our staff

790
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,488
To the highest standards in the industry,

791
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,267
But we are only human, after all.

792
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:12,711
Honey, are you okay?

793
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,537
Nurse Heisel, why don't you step out?

794
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:18,526
I'm so sorry.

795
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:19,225
Uh-Huh.

796
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:28,207
We all share in your grief.

797
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:30,479
Apparently.

798
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:34,491
And we're hoping to alleviate any further pain

799
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:36,515
Your family may suffer

800
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:37,793
By offering some...

801
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:41,260
Monetary compensation.

802
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:44,882
Provided you and your husband waive

803
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:46,534
Any future right to litigation, of course.

804
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,625
Monetary compensation.

805
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:52,887
Are you trying to buy us off?

806
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,335
Let's not get tangled up in legalese.

807
00:39:57,078 --> 00:39:59,754
We like to think of it as an extension
of our caring.

808
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:04,712
Well, in that case...

809
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,141
Care away.

810
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,419
Mr. Hartley,

811
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:13,927
I have a hypothetical legal question for you.

812
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:17,088
I like to play the lottery, and I --

813
00:40:18,518 --> 00:40:20,969
Ha ha. Yes, I know what the odds are,

814
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,910
But I just love those scratch-Offs.

815
00:40:24,095 --> 00:40:26,017
Say I were to win...

816
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:30,032
I don't know, $1,600,000.

817
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:33,150
Would the governmentbe able to take it

818
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:35,316
Like they took everything else?

819
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:40,551
That's what I thought.

820
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:42,166
The bastards.

821
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:44,876
So...

822
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,274
What if we won the lottery after Carlos went to jail?

823
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:50,159
Could the government touch the money then?

824
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:51,416
Hypothetically.

825
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:53,627
I see.

826
00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:57,169
And we could keep the house.

827
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:04,040
Ha ha.

828
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:06,160
Oh, no, I'm just at the grocery store

829
00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:07,519
Wondering if I should buy a ticket.

830
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:09,891
Thanks a bunch, Mr. Hartley.

831
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:13,884
So what time should I bring Carlos
to the D.A.'S office tomorrow?

832
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:16,924
Great.

833
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,779
We all honor heroes for different reasons.

834
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:29,626
Sometimes for their daring...

835
00:41:35,713 --> 00:41:38,314
Sometimes for their bravery...

836
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:42,559
Open.

837
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,492
Sometimes for their goodness.

838
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:48,464
I love you.

839
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:57,111
But mostly, we honor heroes

840
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:01,740
Because at one point or another,

841
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:05,574
We all dream of being rescued.

842
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:17,236
Of course, if the right hero doesn't come along,

843
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:22,805
Sometimes we just have to rescue ourselves.

844
