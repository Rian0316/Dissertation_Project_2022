1
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:03,644
Where the hell were you guys
last week?

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:05,416
I think we should have
our own kid.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,246
Well, can we start right now?

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,244
You're a loud, mean,
vicious bitch.

5
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:10,944
I will fuck you up!

6
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:11,545
Shit!

7
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,610
Shit!

8
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:15,111
How about,
let's teach you a skill?

9
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:17,477
(explosion, gasps)
<i>Where's your grandmother?</i>

10
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:19,945
Buying more supplies.
I'm gonna kill her.

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,248
Can't we just call the police,
tell them about the meth lab?

12
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:23,550
She's my grandmother.
What happened?

13
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:24,750
E.R. doc says cancer.

14
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:26,220
Stage four, pancreatic,

15
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:27,257
<i>doesn't have long to live.</i>

16
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,291
Can you do something for me?

17
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:29,625
Get rid of Jody.

18
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,394
<i>Everything he does</i>
<i>is bugging me.</i>

19
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:32,597
(screams) Get out!

20
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,735
Even the Pentagon says it's

21
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,473
<i>okay to be gay, but you're too</i>
<i>chickenshit to let anyone know.</i>

22
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:40,009
- At least I'm not getting trapped
by some pregnant skank. - Fuck you!

23
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:41,842
Lip, come on, wake up.
First day of school, senior.

24
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,243
- Dropped out.
- What are you talking about?

25
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,512
Got to get a job and take
care of Karen and my kid.

26
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,412
You two are married?

27
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,945
You're married?
Ah, <i>si.</i>

28
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,246
- Why didn't you meet me at the airport?
- I was on my way.

29
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,480
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>Doesn't matter now.</i>

30
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:53,115
I love you.
Don't.

Frank?

51
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:30,378
My mother has cancer.

52
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:31,846
The bad kind?

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,949
As opposed to?

54
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,718
I'm gonna be an orphan.

55
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:39,854
Well...

56
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:43,058
things worked out
for Oliver Twist.

57
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:44,693
And Annie.

58
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,530
She found a way to abandon me

59
00:02:47,564 --> 00:02:49,566
one last time.

60
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,036
The sun'll come out,
just like the song says.

61
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,140
God, do you know how many years

62
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:59,243
I've prayed for this moment?

63
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:01,879
I'll be free.

64
00:03:01,913 --> 00:03:05,916
Well, this might not
be nice to say,

65
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,819
but if anyone deserves cancer,

66
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:11,188
it's your mother.

67
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,561
Where's Grammy?
Frank took her to Sheila's

68
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:19,497
late last night. She was
having trouble breathing.

69
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,234
The chemicals from the fire
were aggravating her emphysema.

70
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,103
Will the chemicals give
us emphysema?

71
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,806
Probably, but we won't
know for 50 years.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,577
FIONA: Carl, the team gives you
one helmet and if you break it,

73
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,178
we can't afford to replace it.

74
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,781
Don't matter. Season's over.
What?

75
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:37,251
Coach got arrested for exposing
himself at the park.

76
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,987
He was peeing being a shed.
A couple of seven-year-old girls

77
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,321
saw "it."

78
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:44,024
I don't get it. Half
the world has penises.

79
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:47,128
Why do people get so upset
about seeing them? Context.

80
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:48,195
What's that?

81
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,198
When, how, where and with who.

82
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,167
Ian, you played--
you could coach.

83
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:57,270
Uh, can't. I got to work
after school, bud. Sorry.

84
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,372
You going to school early?
Chemistry study group.

85
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,774
Can you coach?

86
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,442
I know nothing about football.

87
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,811
It's just boys crashing
into one another.

88
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,215
With pads. And some--
some rules.

89
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,683
Ask Lip.
He won't do it.

90
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,618
Wake him and ask.
Can't hurt.

91
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,720
Lip!

92
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,557
I could have done that.
Upstairs, please.

93
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:24,499
Good morning, love.
Where's the pisser?

94
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,501
Upstairs.
Oh, that's not happening.

95
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:29,203
Get me a bucket.

96
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:36,210
(clearing throat)

97
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:37,511
I heard you have cancer.

98
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,213
Yeah.

99
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,216
I hope it's painful.

100
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,984
Your wish is granted.

101
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,719
You've got two more.
Don't waste 'em.

102
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:47,723
(rattling) You'll be back
in your bed by tonight.

103
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:50,960
The chemical smell from the
explosion will be over by then.

104
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,031
It's not the flu, is it?

105
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:58,668
No, just my body
feeding on itself.

106
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:01,672
Sheila makes a top-notch
breakfast.

107
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,908
I'm good with my
smokes and coffee.

108
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,676
We don't smoke in the house.

109
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:08,412
Well, good.
I won't have to share.

110
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:09,981
Come on.

111
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:12,950
Right there.

112
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:15,153
(urinating)

113
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:17,756
(mutters)

114
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,758
Where are you going?
To the store.

115
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,094
Repl... replenish your smokes.

116
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:24,630
15 minutes. I'm timing you.

117
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:26,298
And get me a new Bic--
a blue one.

118
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:28,066
Not pink like that last one.

119
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,538
O.J., Frank. No pulp.
Hey, numb nuts--

120
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:35,741
toilet paper.

121
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:37,944
I'm not going to drip dry.

122
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,613
Oh, Kleenex.

123
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:42,615
The best for the best.

124
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:49,289
How do you take your coffee?

125
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:51,658
With Baileys or not at all.

126
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:52,793
I have some Bacardi.

127
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:54,561
Pepsi to mix it with?

128
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,397
Fresca.

129
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:58,999
For fuck's sake.

130
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:00,300
Fresca it is--

131
00:06:00,335 --> 00:06:02,135
Twiggy.

132
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:08,742
Couldn't wake him.
Debbie, go brush your teeth.

133
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:11,612
And tell Lip that ice cubes are
going down his shirt next.

134
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:13,780
He's missed a week
of school already.

135
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:15,515
Morning, Gallaghers.
Hi!

136
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,783
Who likes coffee and doughnuts?
All right.

137
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:18,385
Double latte, two sugars.

138
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,357
What the fuck are you doing?
We were out getting coffees,

139
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:24,626
and I thought,
"Hey, school's started.

140
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,662
Why not pop by and give the kids
a ride like the old days?"

141
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:29,164
No heads up so I could put pants on?
I like you with no pants on.

142
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,435
Dude, your wife is standing right there.
No English.

143
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:35,038
(Estefania speaking Portuguese)

144
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:39,809
Does she ever leave your side?

145
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,810
I bought coffee for Lip.

146
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:45,347
Please, stop trying
to make this seem normal.

147
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:49,318
(Estefania speaking Portuguese)

148
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:54,424
Lip won't get up.

149
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,492
Ooh, thanks for
the doughnuts, Jimmy.

150
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:58,227
Yes. You know what, I get it.

151
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,662
You think it's funny to call me

152
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:01,830
Jimmy, but I think it's probably
time to give it a rest.

153
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:05,400
Fat chance, Jim-Jim.
Yeah, yummy doughnuts, Jimbo.

154
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:06,868
All right.

155
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:08,270
(Estefania speaking Portuguese)

156
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,005
I'm not doing this.
Doing what?

157
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,741
This. Was there some
signal that I sent you

158
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:15,109
that suggested popping
by would be cool?

159
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:19,246
I just wanted to bring you a
coffee, start the day right.

160
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:24,418
Figure out that chick who's sitting
on my sofa wearing your wedding ring,

161
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,020
and then we'll talk.

162
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,757
(Estefania speaking Portuguese)

163
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,762
Who wants a ride to school?
DEBBIE AND CARL: I do.

164
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,298
Great. Let's go.
We're going to figure this out.

165
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,700
Just don't give up on me.
Please stop talking.

166
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:44,136
Let's go!

167
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:46,739
Lip!

168
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:49,408
All right. Dig
the helmet, Carl.

169
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:51,377
You play any ball growing up?

170
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:52,878
Carl.
Yo.

171
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:54,246
Junior high. Flanker.
What's a flanker?

172
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,248
It's a white wide receiver.

173
00:07:57,484 --> 00:08:00,386
Hey, you doing anything
this afternoon?

174
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,388
Carl!
What? We need a coach.

175
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:04,257
For what?
Pop Rec Warner League.

176
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,292
Flag?
Helmet to helmet.

177
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:07,760

and finish something.

your diploma? No.

This is a practice test.

00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:26,797
every nine years.

353
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:28,632
So there's not a
chance that you're not

354
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,967
going to live up to
your goddamn potential.

355
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:33,102
Feeling very "O Captain!
My Captain!" are we?

356
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:35,605
I had a teacher who took
a special interest in me

357
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,773
when I was about your age.

358
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:37,974
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

359
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:39,576
He use a condom or...?

360
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,345
It was a woman, smart-ass.

361
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,349
And she showed me the way out,
changed my life.

362
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:48,785
Yet you still ended up
in this job?

363
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,356
I had 22 years in the
Coast Guard before I got here.

364
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,459
And I retired a
lieutenant commander.

365
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:57,829
Wow.
So you're gonna take Physics,

366
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:01,032
Probability and Statistics,
Advanced Chemistry.

367
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,834
And you're gonna take the ACT,

368
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:04,637
and you're gonna get into

369
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:09,508
either Yale or Harvard or MIT
on a full academic ride.

370
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:12,177
Give me your hand.

371
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:14,779
At what point in your career
did you realize that your name,

372
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:17,215
Dick, had become
a euphemism for cock?

373
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,818
Watch your mouth.

374
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,453
The ice you're standing on is

375
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,055
cracking all around
you, Phillip.

376
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,025
And I won't stand around
and watch you drown.

377
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,126
(school bell beeps)

378
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,128
Get to class.

379
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:37,871
Boys, I'm the biggest munchkin
in Munchkin Land,

380
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,974
verging on jigging
while that falling house

381
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:42,676
called cancer is about to crush

382
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,811
the wickedest witch
on the South Side,

383
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,346
my mother, Margaret!

384
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,347
Cheers!

385
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,748
(scattered cheers, clapping)

386
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:50,383
Mmm.

387
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,751
Fabulous Bloody Mary, Kev.

388
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,018
Three dollars, Frank.

389
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:54,720
Know why I ordered
a Bloody Mary?

390
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:55,887
You lack vitamins?

391
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:57,089
I used to make these

392
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:58,223
for Mother on Sundays.

393
00:17:58,258 --> 00:17:59,592
Every Sunday.

394
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:01,560
Horseradish, celery,

395
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:04,197
tomato juice, vodka.
Four fingers worth.

396
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,598
Bring it to her in her chair,

397
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,700
like she was the Queen of Spain.

398
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:09,169
Spain got rid of their royalty.

399
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:10,503
Three dollars, Frank.

400
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:12,205
I'd bring her her Bloody Mary,

401
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,540
and she'd sniff it,

402
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:15,208
and then stick

403
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:17,343
the tippity tip
of her tongue in it,

404
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:19,212
testing it, and if I didn't

405
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:22,215
get it just right,
I'd get a smack.

406
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:24,550
Yeah, she looked like
she'd be a spanker.

407
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:26,919
Oh, no, no, not a spanking.

408
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:30,122
Thought it was half-ass
corporal punishment.

409
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:31,590
Thought, you want
to make an impression,

410
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,626
you got to hit kids
where it hurts,

411
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,128
in the face with a closed fist.

412
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:39,031
Not in the ass,
with all that padding.

413
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,400
I wish I could punch
my kid in the face.

414
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:43,302
Looks just like my ex-wife.

415
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:44,604
Tommy, you realize other people

416
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,039
can hear you
when you speak, right?

417
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:47,273
If I was off with even

418
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:50,076
one part of her recipe, smack!

419
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,147
Deal was, if I didn't cry
the first time, she'd stop.

420
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:58,284
But if I flinched
or shed a tear, another smack.

421
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,253
Had a foster dad
once shaved half my head

422
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:02,322
when I broke curfew.

423
00:19:02,356 --> 00:19:03,623
Looked kinda badass, though.

424
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,926
Flinch? Smack.

425
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,228
Misty? Smack.

426
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,430
Yelp? Smack.

427
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,265
Every Sunday,

428
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,967
without fail.

429
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:16,805
Bloody Mary Sunday.

430
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,773
Gotta piss.

431
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:20,342
Watch my eggs.

432
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,978
Are those the good memories
of his mother

433
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:25,179
or the bad ones?

434
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,948
Interchangeable, apparently.

435
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,084
Hey, what's happening, boys?
You seen Frank?

436
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,853
Frank who?
Don't give me "Frank fucking who?"

437
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:33,121
How many people
come in here named Frank?

438
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,024
Hey, don't get salty, sweetie.

439
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:37,159
There's Frank Stinson,
substitute math teacher

440
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:38,160
who loves Sudoku.

441
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:39,595
There's Frank Salmon,

442
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:41,997
comes in on Thursdays
with his softball buddies,

443
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:43,466
and there's Frank Migneault,

444
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,834
retired air traffic controller,

445
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,368
playing pool.

446
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,304
Frank Gallagher.

447
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:49,638
Check the Rusty Hammer.

448
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,473
They got happy hour breakfast
9:00 to 11:00.

449
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,175
He's a bargain drinker.

450
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,187
(TV playing quietly)

451
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:11,193
Pat her down for weapons?

452
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:12,528
She'll be gone by dinner.

453
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,996
My grandfather died
of lung cancer.

454
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,465
Lived with him
the last three months-- brutal.

455
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:20,668
Was it chilly
in the tent last night?

456
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:23,171
Not too bad.

457
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,673
Has, uh, Karen mentioned me?

458
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:27,676
But you keep believing.

459
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,210
Slow and steady wins the race.

460
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:30,912
Not often.

461
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:32,581
You need the bucket?

462
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:37,219
No, I'm gonna climb
the stairs for this one.

463
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:38,554
Ow!

464
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:40,589
Ooh!

465
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,560
(groans)

466
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:45,594
Are you okay?

467
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,596
Here you go.
I don't need help.

468
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,766
How about a glass
of water, then?

469
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,768
What is that smell?

470
00:20:52,802 --> 00:20:55,770
Did someone step in dog doo?
Not me.

471
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,878
Let's get you upstairs
and clean you up.

472
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:05,746
(groaning)

473
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,780
Oh!

474
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:07,915
Oh!

475
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,051
Ooh!
Let me...

476
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,020
let me draw you a bath.

477
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,556
Let me get you a bath, sweetie.

478
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,424
Let me get you a bath.

479
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:20,393
Do you have something
for the pain?

480
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:24,063
They gave me some Vicodin, but
I don't want to be all doped-up.

481
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:25,298
I can get you
something stronger.

482
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:26,732
No.

483
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,200
(groans)

484
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:29,602
Okay.

485
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:32,605
(door opens)

486
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,640
Geez! Open the windows.

487
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:35,941
It smells like a meth lab.

488
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:37,276
I'm gonna get high
just standing here.

489
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,277
Lean into it.

490
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:39,611
It's a manageable high.

491
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:41,447
Who's boning a barista?

492
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:43,882
Steve brought by coffees
and his wife.

493
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,217
Bad times.

494
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:46,719
He doesn't give up, does he?

495
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,254
He's trying to wear me down.
Just keeps

496
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:50,457
showing up, hoping I'll
find him too irresistible.

497
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:51,658
When guys get
focused on something,

498
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:52,893
it's hard to get 'em off.

499
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,594
They have one-task minds.

500
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:56,597
Kevin turned down
a blow job today.

501
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:59,566
He only wants to get off
inside me now.

502
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,735
Obsessed with saving his
spunk for having a baby.

503
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:04,271
Look at you, the romantic.

504
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:05,939
It's one thing talking
about making a baby,

505
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:07,941
another having to
raise it from scratch.

506
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,943
I don't know if I got
what it takes.

507
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:11,412
You'll be a
kick-ass mother.

508
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:13,914
So much shit you got to know--
SIDS, sleep habits,

509
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:16,683
tooth decay, bullying.
You work in a nursing home.

510
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,685
It's like taking care of
old people in reverse.

511
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:20,954
You did great with
Ethel and Jonah.

512
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,023
Come on. Imagine your
own kid that looks

513
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:24,625
like the two of you combined.

514
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:25,960
That will be one
drop-dead gorgeous child,

515
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:27,761
I'll give you that.
Mm-hmm.

516
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:30,164
What you doing?
Studying.

517
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,134
What?

518
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:34,602
You taking your GED?

519
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:36,337
All right, Fi!
Made a deal with Lip

520
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,106
that I'd go back to
school if he did.

521
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,674
Quiz me.

522
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,944
Who was the fourth president
of the United States?

523
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,680
John Quincy Adams.

524
00:22:44,714 --> 00:22:47,349
James Madison.
Jasmine was right.

525
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:49,351
I should just have some rich
dude knock me up

526
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:51,020
before it's too late.
We could be barefoot

527
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,655
and pregnant together.
(chuckles)

528
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:54,723
(knock at door)

529
00:22:57,193 --> 00:22:58,493
Frank here?

530
00:22:58,527 --> 00:22:59,895
No.

531
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,897
When's he going to be back?

532
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,498
For as long as I've been alive,

533
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:06,335
I haven't known the answer
to that question.

534
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,310
That is the dirtiest white boy
in America.

535
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:17,513
WOMAN: You have
made a great choice

536
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:19,015
to honor the budding life
inside you.

537
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,583
(chuckles) Time will tell.

538
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:23,152
I'm sure we'll find the baby
a good home.

539
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:26,155
Can you find me one?
(woman chuckles)

540
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,690
The Catholic couple
that we'll place

541
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:30,993
your baby with has most likely
struggled to get pregnant,

542
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:34,396
so they are committed
to having a family.

543
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,198
Now, um, are...
are you limited

544
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:37,933
to, uh, only Catholic families,

545
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,768
or can other people apply?

546
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:41,236
WOMAN:
We do attempt to find

547
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:42,538
families of faith first.

548
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:44,673
Yeah. Cool. So how
much do we get?

549
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,943
We'll be sure
to place your baby

550
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,878
with parents
who can support it.

551
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:51,014
Yeah, you...
you said that.

552
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:52,682
How much do we get

553
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,351
for the baby?

554
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:57,922
This is a chance
to celebrate a life.

555
00:23:57,956 --> 00:23:59,757
So no money?

556
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:03,393
Oxy...

557
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:05,962
and Percocet, Valium.

558
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:07,230
Yikes.

559
00:24:07,264 --> 00:24:08,898
I also got
an I.V. morphine drip.

560
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:10,567
(gasps) Got a lot
of friends I met

561
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:12,202
in programs that end
in the letter "A."

562
00:24:12,236 --> 00:24:13,870
You still want a shower?

563
00:24:13,904 --> 00:24:15,538
Nah, I'm going to hit the tent.

564
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:17,073
Karen could be home soon.

565
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,308
I don't want to upset
her and blow my chances.

566
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:23,146
I'm... I'm going
to talk to her

567
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,148
about keeping the baby

568
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:27,483
and about keeping
you in her life.

569
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:30,086
Thanks, Mom.
You'd be an incredible daddy.

570
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,321
I've always wanted to be.

571
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:36,426
(groaning)

572
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,795
Ow.

573
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:40,230
Take this.

574
00:24:40,264 --> 00:24:41,932
JODY:
Wash it down.

575
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:47,438
(sighs)

576
00:24:47,472 --> 00:24:49,140
Ugh.

577
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:52,844
She should really
be in hospice.

578
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:54,413
(groaning sigh)

579
00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:56,014
God, life is just so...

580
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:57,516
just...

581
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,285
(growls)

582
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,287
You know, like, sometimes
don't you just want

583
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:03,756
to shake your fists at it?

584
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,426
Why does it have to be
so hard for people?

585
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:13,967
(groans)

586
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,342
(sighs)

587
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:24,344
It's going to be all right.

588
00:25:27,882 --> 00:25:31,051
Let's don't start lying
to each other now.

589
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:36,456
Walked in on my mother

590
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,758
and my sixth-grade
teacher having sex once.

591
00:25:40,494 --> 00:25:43,463
That'll teach you not to play hooky.
(inhaling)

592
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:46,801
My mother's nipples
were the size of sand dollars.

593
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:50,705
(inhaling)

594
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,408
She was on top, riding him.

595
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:54,843
He's underneath,
bucking like a horse

596
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:56,678
who knows it's headed

597
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:58,513
for the glue factory.

598
00:25:58,548 --> 00:26:01,082
She didn't even tell me
to leave the room.

599
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:03,151
(whistle blows)

600
00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:09,825
Tell Fiona you're coaching,
Jimmy?

601
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,162
Don't you tell her everything for me?
Family first.

602
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,731
Those of us with only one name
find that easy to remember.

603
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:16,900
Haven't told her about this,
because I wasn't sure

604
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:18,368
you were going to show up.

605
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,169
You know, I'm just
trying to give back

606
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,704
to the community,
help some disadvantaged kids

607
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:22,938
learn a great American sport.

608
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:27,844
(Estefania speaking Portuguese)

609
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:30,213
(blows whistle)
Yo. When do we get to tackle?

610
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:31,881
Soon. Take a knee.

611
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,717
All right, boys.

612
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:37,286
Football is all about

613
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,420
who wants it more.

614
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:42,023
When you tackle,
aim low, hit hard!

615
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:43,724
Who thinks they're man enough
to take me down?

616
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:45,358
Huh?
You don't have pads on.

617
00:26:45,392 --> 00:26:46,526
We're just... we're
doing a walk-through.

618
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,360
Okay?

619
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:49,928
(grunts)

620
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,530
(groans)

621
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:53,764
Clean hit.

622
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:55,633
I like it.
(laughter)

623
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,934
Oh... (sighs)

624
00:26:57,968 --> 00:26:59,902
I wish I'd had a girl coach.

625
00:26:59,937 --> 00:27:02,304
I'd totally tap that.
Yeah.

626
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:03,605
I love long hair.

627
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:06,207
No, no, no.

628
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:08,643
The one with the little
brunette pixieish cut.

629
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:11,245
Like a 1963

630
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
brunette Mia Farrow.

631
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:14,548
No titties, all ass.

632
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:15,783
Just sit and spin her

633
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:18,218
all night long.

634
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:19,452
Heaven.

635
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:21,654
I-I think
that's a dude.

636
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:28,026
(whistle blows)

637
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,601
Start by filling out these.

638
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,069
Now, uh, do you check,

639
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:40,604
uh, the families

640
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:41,838
for, you know, um,

641
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:43,439
alcohol and drug abuse?

642
00:27:43,473 --> 00:27:44,807
You know, make sure they have

643
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,508
enough income
to feed it and stuff?

644
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:47,910
We do.

645
00:27:47,944 --> 00:27:50,012
Right, and, uh, are the families

646
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:53,314
mostly in the Chicago area
or the whole state?

647
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:55,483
What's it matter?
We're getting rid of it.

648
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,785
You going to stalk it

649
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:59,219
at its Little League games?

650
00:28:00,488 --> 00:28:02,289
Have you looked
at other options?

651
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:04,425
Like aborting it? Yeah.

652
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,093
But my dad taught me
it was murder,

653
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:08,262
and the thing does have
a heartbeat and all.

654
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:10,030
Yeah, we went to see
the Catholics earlier.

655
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,300
We found out
they don't pay anything.

656
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:13,802
Neither do we.

657
00:28:13,836 --> 00:28:16,204
I thought there was a separation
of church and state.

658
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:18,105
I'm not following you.

659
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,875
I get the Catholics went broke
with those pedophile lawsuits,

660
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,277
but how can the government
expect me not to smoke

661
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:28,181
or do drugs so that the baby
doesn't turn out

662
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:30,450
a brain-damaged future criminal,

663
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:31,885
yet expects me

664
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,320
to do all the work for free?

665
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:43,895
Call my friend, Timothy.

666
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:45,696
He's a family attorney.

667
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,831
No, we can't afford a lawyer.

668
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:50,300
Tell him Stacy sent you.

669
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:54,637
Which of the following
political actions violated

670
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:57,339
the principle of unalienable
rights of liberty

671
00:28:57,373 --> 00:28:58,740
that evolved
from the above excerpt

672
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:00,375
of the Declaration
of Independence?

673
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:02,978
One. In 1857, a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling

674
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:04,312
promoted the
expansion of slavery

675
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:05,547
in U.S. territories.

676
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:07,016
Two...
That one.

677
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,384
It's a, uh...

678
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:09,685
multiple choice test.

679
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,220
You want to hear
the other options?

680
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:13,522
It's that one.
Hey, Mickey Milkovich

681
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:16,058
came by earlier looking
for Frank, all sweaty.

682
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:18,394
Isn't he working at the store
while you're at school?

683
00:29:18,428 --> 00:29:20,363
When he shows up.

684
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,765
Why is he looking for Frank?

685
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,334
Probably getting high together.

686
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:25,268
(door closes)

687
00:29:25,302 --> 00:29:26,736
Dinner in 15 minutes.

688
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:28,205
I'm going to head out
for a while.

689
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:29,439
Where were you guys?

690
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:30,774
Football practice.

691
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:32,176
Thought your coach
got arrested.

692
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,278
A new guy stepped
in to save the day.

693
00:29:34,312 --> 00:29:35,579
What do you know about football?

694
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,948
Well, you... make a pass,

695
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:39,583
sometimes you score.

696
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:41,618
Ugh. I meant what
I said this morning.

697
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:44,220
We got a big
scrimmage tomorrow.

698
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:47,189
And I say that we celebrate
the guaranteed victory

699
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:48,191
Yeah! by cooking a big
Brazilian dinner.

700
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:49,926
What do you say?
Right, Esty?

701
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,060
"Esty."

702
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:53,229
Tomorrow, come here.

703
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:55,432
Cook food.
<i>Si, si.</i>

704
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:58,068
Eat. Eat. Uh... Uh, poor people.

705
00:29:58,102 --> 00:30:00,037
Crack. I help.

706
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:01,538
Dude.

707
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:03,807
Poor people? Awesome.

708
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:05,109
See you tomorrow.

709
00:30:05,144 --> 00:30:07,111
CARL: Can we go
bring Grammy back?

710
00:30:07,146 --> 00:30:10,281
She promised to teach us how to palm cards.
Grammy blew up the basement.

711
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:12,450
We could've lost Carl. So she's
having a time-out at Sheila's.

712
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:14,052
And you know,
when you're having a time-out,

713
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:15,687
you don't get
to visit with your family.

714
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,957
Yo, you pick out
all your classes?

715
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:21,059
Taking my GED.

716
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:22,894
Uh... no, that
wasn't the deal.

717
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:25,796
Well, I still got to earn
money-- food, utilities.

718
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,399
You finish your senior
year, I take the GED.

719
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:31,068
I didn't agree to an equivalent.
If it's good enough for the state,

720
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:33,305
it's good enough for me. Fine.
Then I'll take my GED.

721
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:36,108
The GED is for quitters, not
geniuses. Put the pasta in

722
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:39,011
when the water boils.
I have to go study.

723
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:50,625
Why is she still here?

724
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:52,160
No one came and picked her up.

725
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:54,162
What's with the bed?

726
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:55,196
Jody set it up.

727
00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:57,265
Mammoth heart, that Jody.

728
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,367
Oh, it smells in here.

729
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:01,337
I've rinsed the bucket
twice already.

730
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:02,939
Get on the kazoo.

731
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:06,809
Tell Jody to roll her
to a fire station

732
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:08,844
and safe-haven
her ass.

733
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:11,814
Frank, she's in pain.

734
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:13,784
What... what's all this? Pills.

735
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,686
Jody got them.

736
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,155
He even started an
I.V. drip-- morphine.

737
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,358
How many milligrams?
He'd be the kind

738
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:23,462
of son-in-law
that would take care of us

739
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:25,197
in our later years.

740
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,465
You know?

741
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,668
Why don't you go upstairs?

742
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:30,069
Get your rest.

743
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:31,337
I'll sit with Mom.

744
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:33,140
You sure?

745
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:35,208
She's my mother.

746
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:38,078
We're a good team,
Frank, you and I.

747
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:40,248
You're a good son.

748
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:42,817
Well...
Make your peace with her.

749
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:45,219
I don't think she
has a long time.

750
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:55,030
(mouthing)

751
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:59,235

♪ ♪

753
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:34,936
Why we killing him again?

754
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,938
He raped a girl.

755
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:39,941
Statutory or catch and release?

756
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:43,244
Shit. He's locking up.
No Frank.

757
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,913
KEVIN:
Hey, man, you all right?

758
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:46,615
You need a cab?

00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,520
Shit.

Mm.

762
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:14,411
(yawns) Morning.

763
00:33:14,446 --> 00:33:17,181
Meg texted you from the club.
Says your last paycheck's in.

764
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:19,783
I told her you'd go get it today.
Please don't take my phone.

765
00:33:19,818 --> 00:33:21,452
And please don't impersonate me.

766
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:22,753
You left it in the bathroom.

767
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:24,522
Liam almost dropped it
in the toilet.

768
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:27,124
Where's Ian?
Left early again.

769
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:29,327
Coming to my scrimmage today?
Wouldn't miss it!

770
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,128
Should I bring some breakfast
over to Grammy?

771
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:32,997
She gets hungry after
her morning cigarettes.

772
00:33:33,032 --> 00:33:35,333
Sheila has food at her house,
she'll feed her.

773
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:37,035
Lip! Up!

774
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:39,838
I don't have class till 10:00.
I'm gonna go help Kev.

775
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:42,307
You like your classes this year?
I love them. Thanks.

776
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:44,376
Quite welcome.
Go learn your state capitals.

777
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,977
Go fuck yourself.
Will do.

778
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:47,479
Hey. Swing this at my head.

779
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:49,714
I'm trying to
strengthen my neck.

780
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:57,521
Awesome...

781
00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:59,990
(train rattles past)

782
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:03,226
I don't have any money.

783
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:05,061
IAN:
You got to lie low, Frank.

784
00:34:05,095 --> 00:34:06,362
Mother's laying down.

785
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:09,532
A lot of pain. I...

786
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:11,200
I got her pain pills.

787
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:12,701
Mickey thinks you're
going to tell everybody

788
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:13,969
about what you saw.

789
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:16,338
(scoffs)

790
00:34:16,372 --> 00:34:18,340
Men have always had men.

791
00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:23,012
DaVinci, Abe Lincoln,
the guy from <i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>

792
00:34:23,047 --> 00:34:24,480
Choose a gender,

793
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:26,649
and find someone
who wants to fuck.

794
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:29,252
Preferably...
for free.

795
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:31,488
Mickey wants to kill you.

796
00:34:31,523 --> 00:34:33,523
I don't want him to go to Juvie.

797
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:35,025
Hey.

798
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:36,660
This is bad, Frank.

799
00:34:36,694 --> 00:34:38,895
What's happening to
my mother is bad.

800
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,764
Very, very bad.

801
00:34:40,798 --> 00:34:43,200
Dying is bad.

802
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:45,735
(sighs)

803
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,370
Try to avoid it, son.

804
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,944
It's amazing, when you start
thinking about babies.

805
00:34:54,979 --> 00:34:56,880
My testicles have
never been my ally.

806
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:58,715
It's a whole other thing,

807
00:34:58,749 --> 00:35:01,884
shifting from screwing just as,
you know, screwing,

808
00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:04,053
to screwing with the purpose
of creating a new person.

809
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:05,454
Of course,
you know that already,

810
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:07,723
you've proven your sperm
can spawn new life.

811
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:09,291
Yeah, well, might not be mine.

812
00:35:09,326 --> 00:35:11,394
And it's a little different
when the baby's a surprise

813
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:12,628
and the mother doesn't want it.

814
00:35:12,663 --> 00:35:14,596
Karen decide what
she want to do yet?

815
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,565
No. We're seeing a family
attorney this morning.

816
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,900
Ask me again after school.

817
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,535
You're back in school?

818
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:22,304
Yeah. I promised Fiona
I'd go back if she did.

819
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:24,206
Fiona's back in high school?

820
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:25,741
Trying to get her GED.

821
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:28,209
She'll fail.
Then I can quit again.

822
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:29,444
She won't fail.
She's smart.

823
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:31,479
Yeah, but...
not school smart.

824
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,280
Dude, who the hell around here
is gonna go to school

825
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:34,548
if the one really
smart guy quits?

826
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,916
That's not my problem.

827
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:37,885
I disagree.
You want to quit something,

828
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,719
quit trying to make
your life complicated.

829
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:42,255
Go to school, and enjoy
being smarter than everyone,

830
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,624
and become Master of
the Universe. I mean, fuck.

831
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:46,393
Well, what if I don't want to
be Master of the Universe?

832
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:49,596
Tough! You've got to be
one of those ridiculously rich,

833
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,498
successful dudes, and put my kid

834
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:52,766
through college someday.

835
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,401
But no pressure.

836
00:35:57,537 --> 00:35:59,137
(Grammy moans) How you feeling?

837
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:04,743
Incredible.

838
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:06,512
Let's go dancing.

839
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:09,115
(groans)

840
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:11,117
Christ.

841
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:12,918
I shoulda ate more salads.

842
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:14,787
Do you want me to
get you one now?

843
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:16,155
No.

844
00:36:16,189 --> 00:36:17,757
Did you call Fiona?

845
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,426
Well... she seemed

846
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,494
reluctant to-to have you

847
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:23,796
come back home.

848
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,030
Reluctant?

849
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:27,132
She said you set
her house on fire.

850
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:31,203
Christ!

851
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:34,640
Somehow, I've been banished
to ride this out

852
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:36,141
in a stranger's house

853
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:38,844
where none of my grandkids
come to visit me.

854
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:41,881
And my son ran away with all
the painkillers you brought me.

855
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:43,682
I'm on it.
Drug run!

856
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:48,955
He's like a superhero.

857
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,390
He's all right.

858
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:51,725
And so are you.

859
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:56,296
Monica-- you know, Frank's ex?--
she was a bitch.

860
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,232
You're not a bitch.
Thank you.

861
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:03,703
How do you do that?

862
00:37:03,737 --> 00:37:05,471
The "nice" thing?

863
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:10,042
I was a shitty mother.
Shitty, shitty, shitty.

864
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,645
But what are you gonna do? Cry?

865
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,380
Nah.

866
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:17,416
Three of my four sons
turned out all right.

867
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,651
None of them are
incarcerated, currently.

868
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:22,087
So I'm not gonna complain.

869
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:26,393
I'm sorry I pointed
that gun at you.

870
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:29,330
Well...

871
00:37:29,364 --> 00:37:31,099
I never

872
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:32,867
should've said your

873
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:35,537
cootchie smells like sulfur.

874
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:37,106
I...

875
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,275
I've always taken care
of myself down there.

876
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:42,244
Not easy, the older you get.

877
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:44,213
Oh, don't I know it.

878
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:47,016
(winces)

879
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:48,184
Oh, Jesus God...

880
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:50,420
(groans) (murmurs)

881
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:52,555
Ah... Maybe.
Let me see if I can get Jody.

882
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:54,089
Hold on.

883
00:37:57,094 --> 00:38:02,466
(playing loudly)

884
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:04,902
Where is he?

885
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:06,737
I have no idea.
He's had 24 hours

886
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:08,740
to run his mouth already.
Where is he?

887
00:38:08,774 --> 00:38:11,243
He won't.
If my dad finds out about this,

888
00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:12,778
he will kill me himself.

889
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:14,713
I've been to 16 bars,

890
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:16,649
the homeless shelter,
shantytown under the El,

891
00:38:16,683 --> 00:38:18,651
your house, batty Sheila's...
where the fuck is he?

892
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:21,821
I don't know!
Bullshit!

893
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:25,557
You warned him.

894
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:27,091
I hate him more than you do.

895
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:28,927
I ain't stealing this.

896
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:32,396
This is less than what I'm owed
for my hours this week.

897
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,165
I'm done. Done... done.

898
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,800
Frank's walked in on Fiona
and all of her boyfriends,

899
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,902
walked in on Lip and his girls.

900
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:41,405
We got nothing to be ashamed of.
What fucking world do you live in?

901
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:42,939
You can't...

902
00:38:42,974 --> 00:38:45,142
you can't... you know...

903
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:48,579
I don't want you to...
What did I just say to you? Done is done.

904
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:50,014
What, you think we're boyfriend
and girlfriend here?

905
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:53,251
You're nothing but
a warm mouth to me.

906
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:56,254
Sorry I gotta go kill your dad,
but I'm doing a lot of people

907
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,657
a favor, including you.

908
00:39:00,694 --> 00:39:02,428
MAN:
<i>You say go,</i>

909
00:39:02,462 --> 00:39:05,031
I'll put out the word.
All right, so you're a broker?

910
00:39:05,065 --> 00:39:07,467
I introduce you to a pool of
parents that want to adopt.

911
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:10,703
They want to make sure that the
baby gets good prenatal care,

912
00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:13,673
food, travel to and from
the doctor... I mean,

913
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:15,174
these things cost
money, and they

914
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,443
pay cash for these things.

915
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:19,211
And other things that you
might think that you need.

916
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:24,182
A new computer, so you can read
up on all the Mommy Web sites.

917
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:25,717
Maternity clothes.
Paternity clothes.

918
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,720
I mean, you're young.

919
00:39:27,754 --> 00:39:30,357
As long as you
take your folic acid

920
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:33,026
and avoid hard drugs,
you'll clean up.

921
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:35,229
I like this guy.

922
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:37,832
And you can always change
your mind, and keep the baby

923
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:39,800
and the money
that they gave you.

924
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,168
But I wouldn't.

925
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:44,204
Kids can be, uh...
a pain in the ass.

926
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,540
Here are some letters from
prospective parents lobbying me

927
00:39:47,575 --> 00:39:49,141
for an all-white baby.

928
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:50,710
You look them over.

929
00:39:50,744 --> 00:39:53,580
See if any of
their prose sways you.

930
00:39:53,614 --> 00:39:55,082
In my experience, the deeper

931
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:57,718
the flowery bullshit,
the richer they are.

932
00:39:57,752 --> 00:40:01,387
Wealthy, infertile people will
go all out trying to buy babies.

933
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:03,189
Right. But they're still
good families, right?

934
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:06,192
I mean, you make sure
they're going to decent parents?

935
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:07,760
Since when is rich not good?

936
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,934
Something a little extra
in there for you.

937
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,403
Ah, you covered my
ass a few times,

938
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:18,705
never called in fake sick.

939
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:19,939
Thanks.

940
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:21,741
Customers sure do love you.

941
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:23,777
No way you can stay on?

942
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:26,413
Summer's over. Nobody left at
home to watch my baby brother.

943
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:28,682
Well, we might be opening up
a new club soon.

944
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:31,351
Upscale, tips are gonna be good.
I appreciate it, Meg.

945
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:32,619
I just...

946
00:40:32,654 --> 00:40:34,188
I just can't.

947
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:35,589
But you're good with people.

948
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:40,227
And not just people who nap
and use sippy cups.

949
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:42,529
There's not much flexibility
when your childcare worker

950
00:40:42,563 --> 00:40:44,431
has to go back to
elementary school.

951
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:46,899
Gonna need a third
assistant manager soon.

952
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:48,701
Kiomi's heading back to Tokyo

953
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:50,236
to get married to
that jerk from Nokia.

954
00:40:50,271 --> 00:40:52,472
I can't work nights.

955
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:55,308
Liam needs me during
the day. I like him.

956
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:57,144
Most of the time, he likes me.

957
00:40:57,178 --> 00:40:58,445
(cell phone ringing)

958
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:01,047
Well, if things change,
track me down.

959
00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:03,716
Hey. Yeah.

960
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:06,585
(sighs)

961
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,989
KAREN: These douches sent me a picture
of a tree with a swing in it.

962
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:13,093
(laughs) And this guy's wearing
a Tommy Bahama shirt.

963
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:14,561
I'm not letting my kid

964
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:18,264
get molested by some guy
in a Tommy Bahama shirt.

965
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:20,467
Prada, maybe.

966
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,135
Why is this such a joke to you?

967
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:24,070
It's not a joke.

968
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:26,006
I'm providing a valuable service

969
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,774
to losers who God
doesn't want having kids.

970
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,609
And I'm getting paid.
Oh, yeah, but don't you think

971
00:41:29,644 --> 00:41:31,244
it's a little messed up?

972
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:35,281
You know, our kid's gonna
be out there alive.

973
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:37,850
You know, living life,
looking like us,

974
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:39,619
being raised by strangers?

975
00:41:39,653 --> 00:41:42,488
Who says it's yours?

976
00:41:42,522 --> 00:41:44,089
The 200 times we fucked!

977
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:45,691
We weren't exclusive.

978
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:47,259
Stop making this a big deal.

979
00:41:47,293 --> 00:41:49,294
I'm merely the manufacturer.

980
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:51,296
If there's a market
for babies out there,

981
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:52,864
I'm gonna corner my share.

982
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:54,866
Who knows? I might just
do this every year.

983
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:57,302
Make a mint.

984
00:41:57,336 --> 00:41:59,470

you're looking very beautiful.

995
00:42:23,695 --> 00:42:25,162
I am not.

996
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:26,530
And no toenail polish

997
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:28,866
is gonna fix it.

998
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,668
Everyone's beautiful
on the inside.

999
00:42:32,004 --> 00:42:34,339
Way, way inside.

1000
00:42:34,373 --> 00:42:36,475
Have the coroner cut me open
when this is done

1001
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:38,177
and see if that's true.

1002
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:39,745
I need a drink.

1003
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:41,413
JODY: Sorry I couldn't
rustle up more drugs for you.

1004
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,081
Shipment lands tonight.
Can you ride it out?

1005
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:45,250
At the Alibi,

1006
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:46,050
yes.

1007
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:47,919
Sheila, get me three

1008
00:42:47,953 --> 00:42:50,922
big envelopes and some stamps.

1009
00:42:50,956 --> 00:42:52,390
We're off to the Alibi.

1010
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:56,160
I don't like to
leave the house.

1011
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:58,094
Well, suck it up.

1012
00:42:58,129 --> 00:42:59,262
You need to get me

1013
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:01,264
out of this morgue.

1014
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:04,200
I owe you a drink,
at the very least.

1015
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:05,535
What are you doing?

1016
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:08,004
Sending cash to my sons.

1017
00:43:08,038 --> 00:43:12,875
That will make Frank
very happy.

1018
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:14,510
Frank gets none.

1019
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:19,548
That's what happens
when you steal my drugs.

1020
00:43:19,582 --> 00:43:23,352
Accretion onto a stationary
black hole has been solved

1021
00:43:23,386 --> 00:43:25,287
analytically only

1022
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:27,689
under the assumption
of spherical symmetry.

1023
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:32,059
Who used the Newtonian treatment
of accretion?

1024
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:34,694
Who used the full
general relativistic one?

1025
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:37,731
It's in your
textbooks. Anyone?

1026
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:39,132
Mr. Gallagher?

1027
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:44,071
What?

1028
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:46,040
Do you know the answer?

1029
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:51,312
Uh, I believe the answer
to that question, um,

1030
00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:54,481
like the answer
to most questions, is fuck you.

1031
00:43:54,516 --> 00:43:55,716
(students gasping)

1032
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,051
Anyone else?

1033
00:43:58,086 --> 00:43:59,619
Newtonian accretion?

1034
00:43:59,654 --> 00:44:03,156
No, really, the answer
is fuck you!

1035
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,398
Frank's at the Alibi.

1036
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:13,399
I got this.

1037
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:14,767
No, we got your back.

1038
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:16,302
I know you do, but I got it.

1039
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:17,736
I hate rapists, too.

1040
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:19,138
Okay, so get the next one.

1041
00:44:19,172 --> 00:44:21,506
We're coming.
Grab a mask.

1042
00:44:26,012 --> 00:44:26,979
(knocking)

1043
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:28,147
Miss Gallagher?

1044
00:44:28,181 --> 00:44:29,582
Yeah. Come on in.

1045
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:31,584
I didn't know
if you remembered me.

1046
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:32,985
Of course, Mr. Healey.

1047
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,287
How are you?

1048
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,623
Well, one more year
till full pension,

1049
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:37,758
then it's taillights.

1050
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:38,759
Congrats.

1051
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:40,427
What's up?

1052
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:42,997
(sighs) Lip's been expelled.

1053
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:44,265
What?

1054
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,467
Threw a chair through a window.

1055
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:46,468
Come on. Expelled?

1056
00:44:46,502 --> 00:44:47,802
Smoking dope in the bathroom,

1057
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:49,871
telling teachers to eff off.

1058
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:52,673
But I called around
to a few friends.

1059
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:56,043
I used to coach wrestling
over at Mckinley.

1060
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:58,179
They'll take him.

1061
00:44:58,213 --> 00:45:00,548

00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:29,379
Lip?

1246
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:31,443
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Mom!

1247
00:54:31,538 --> 00:54:32,858
Mimosa?

1248
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:38,159
Oh, jeez!
In the kitchen!?

1249
00:54:38,252 --> 00:54:41,514
Give Debbie some mommy time.
Might be the only one she gets.

1250
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,033
If I was rich, then you'd
consider keeping the kid with me?

1251
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:45,224
How rich?

1252
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:47,215
I think you should consider
keeping the baby,

1253
00:54:47,302 --> 00:54:48,845
and Jody.

1254
00:54:49,101 --> 00:54:50,227
Let me stay here for a bit.

1255
00:54:50,322 --> 00:54:53,046
I'll piss her off so much, she'll
be back here door step in a heart beat.

1256
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,344
You're living at Steve's!?

1257
00:54:54,443 --> 00:54:56,081
This has nothing to do with you!
