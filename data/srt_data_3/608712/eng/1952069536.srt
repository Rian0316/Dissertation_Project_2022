1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:05,291
God made a garden for Man
and Woman and he told them...

2
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:07,887
'"Do not eat of the fruit from that tree. '"

3
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:11,529
A serpent visited the Woman and
offered her an apple from the tree.

4
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:13,763
He told her the apple
would give her knowledge.

5
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:15,730
He was very persuasive...

6
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:18,805
and Mankind has been
paying the price ever since.

7
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,124
All because we were tempted
by something we didn't need.

8
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:26,689
The serpent was the first grifter.

9
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,643
Yo, Terry, what's going on?
It's Chazz again.

10
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:40,011
'Ere what, yeah. I need those flaming
boxes delivered this afternoon, drey.

11
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:42,971
You can do that for me,
just put them all in the van, yeah?

12
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:44,566
Yeah, that'll be great.

13
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:47,167
Yeah, Terry, gotta put you on hold,
it's my mom on the other line.

14
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:49,562
Probably her hip again. One sec.

15
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:52,008
Mr. Hyotona, konnichiwa.

16
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,323
Yes, the artifact is with me now.

17
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:57,007
Of course you can see it
but time is of the essence.

18
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:59,561
I'm expecting a consignment
of Italian lithographs...

19
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:03,282
all arriving this afternoon
in identical boxes, unmarked of course.

20
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:07,412
Mr. Emmerick's phone.
Mr. Jensen, I'll put you right through.

21
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,724
Yes, Mr. Hyotona, I'll have to place you
on hold. It's my Madrid dealer.

22
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:14,852
Mr. Jensen.

23
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:17,926
I'm afraid there's another interested party.

24
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:21,843
Well, an original, illuminated,
6th century transcript...

25
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:25,403
of the Pentateuchal books of the Bible
is bound to generate a lot of buzz.

26
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:26,972
You've seen the Photostats?

27
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,851
Some of these pictures
put even the Book of Kells to shame.

28
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,005
What's that? You haven't seen them?

29
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,487
My associate, Professor Jackson,
isn't with you?

30
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:39,610
Ash, where
is Professor sodding Jackson?

31
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:42,402
Albert hasn't shown. I can't raise him.

32
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:45,485
I'm sure there's a very good reason
why he's not with you.

33
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:48,491
Albert's not turned up.

34
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:52,327
One moment please, Mr. Jensen,
my PA has just walked in.

35
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,724
What do you mean he's not turned up?

36
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,405
He ain't there, okay?

37
00:01:56,493 --> 00:02:00,008
He's a no-show, Mickey.
The street is an Albert-free zone.

38
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,651
For the poor?

39
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,685
Are you troubled, my son?

40
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:41,923
I think I saw the future today.

41
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:45,403
God sometimes gives us glimpses
of the path we are traveling.

42
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:48,166
I always thought I knew
just where I was headed.

43
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:49,845
Truth is, Sister...

44
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:51,926
now I'm not so sure.

45
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:53,685
Do not despair.

46
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,172
There is always hope.

47
00:02:56,373 --> 00:03:00,605
I don't mean to split hairs, Sister,
but I don't believe in hope exactly.

48
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,049
I prefer to call it chance.

49
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:15,091
And a chance has to be grabbed.

50
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,891
What's your problem, my son?

51
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:23,850
I'm not a churchgoer, Father.

52
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,687
The wife's a big fan, though.

53
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:29,129
She told me to light a candle
to Saint Marie of the Incarnation.

54
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:33,406
I'll bend the knee to any statue you like.
But you have got to help me.

55
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,888
Albie. We were worried.

56
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:37,645
What are you, my nurse? I'm fine.

57
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,724
Look, there's bad news
and there's good news.

58
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,247
When you didn't show,
the marks lost their bottle.

59
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,527
So you've had the bad, then.

60
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:45,569
-Where the hell were you?
-We were worried.

61
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,645
Albie, if you want to go off-piste,
at least let the rest of us know.

62
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,963
This one has always been a no-no.

63
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:52,611
I've had a bad feeling from the off.

64
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,604
Okay, so what's the good news?

65
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,851
Johnny Keyes.

66
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,447
Keyes. Oh, yeah. I know him.

67
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,211
Proper hard man. Proper East End, he is.

68
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,362
I thought he was a chef.

69
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:08,092
'"The Kitchen King. '"
Yeah, my missus had that book.

70
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:11,245
So you saw a fancy chef in a church.

71
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:13,211
Whoopee diddley doo!

72
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:16,763
No. I saw a powerful, arrogant thug.

73
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:21,409
With cash in his pockets
and desperation in his eyes.

74
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,370
What's he got to be desperate about?

75
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:27,207
He grew up on the streets,
robbing houses, talking with his fists.

76
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,682
Yeah, not to mention
turning over a couple of banks.

77
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:32,048
And he did time for that. A lot of time.

78
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:36,042
Some say they should have
thrown away the key.

79
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:39,606
This man was evil personified.

80
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:44,243
Inside I was just like the rest of them.
A nobody.

81
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:48,651
I did kitchen detail
just to pass the time at first.

82
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:51,329
But then it got into my blood.

83
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:54,412
And I was devouring books.
Hungry to learn.

84
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:56,131
Cooking for the big men.

85
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:59,569
So he gets out of prison and buys
a restaurant with a bag of gold bullion.

86
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:01,962
-And now of course, he runs K's.
-K's.

87
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:04,521
Who do you have to kill to get
a table in there these days?

88
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,564
He said it's in case I get a puncture.

89
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,206
So why is he desperate?

90
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:20,924
What most people have forgotten
is the story of James.

91
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,527
His son.

92
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:27,447
In 1974, his one-year-old son
was kidnapped.

93
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:31,091
Never to be heard or seen again.

94
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:33,448
I had a lot of enemies in those days.

95
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,009
But I'll never know
which bastard took him.

96
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,483
I couldn't pay what they wanted.
I didn't have the ransom, all right?

97
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,528
I've got to find him.

98
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:44,126
Before it's too late.

99
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:45,202
Keyes is sick.

100
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:50,083
A bum ticker. He wants to find his heir
before they stick him in the ground.

101
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,689
James would be 32 now.

102
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:56,051
So you're talking birthrights...

103
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,806
inheritance, that's your angle, is it?

104
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:03,284
Sorry, but stinging some guy who's
still grieving over his long lost son?

105
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,887
Don't shed one tear for him, my dear.

106
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,329
The guy's a nasty piece of work.

107
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:11,691
I got a feeling in my bones that he's close.

108
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,122
I got money for him.

109
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:16,683
Plenty to help him make something
of himself, the way I did.

110
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,604
If I could give him the money...

111
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:21,127
least then I'd feel
I'd done something for him.

112
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,126
Now what?

113
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:27,892
I think we should reunite him
with his long lost son.

114
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,327
Albert.

115
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:35,248
What the hell were you doing
in a church today?

116
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,808
Gil Stewart died this afternoon.

117
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,646
I was there at the end.

118
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:43,169
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, Albert.
You two were like brothers.

119
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:48,326
We worked Vegas together.

120
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:51,013
That man was made for bright lights.

121
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:52,927
Poor bastard.

122
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:56,288
Died of a stroke in a dental surgery.

123
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:57,965
Well, someone should sue them.

124
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,045
He was pretending to be the dentist.

125
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:10,123
Before he died...

126
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,252
he gave me this.

127
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:13,562
His wedding ring.

128
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,401
All those years of hard grift...

129
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:20,963
and he dies holding
a bottle of plaque remover.

130
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:23,532
When I die, Mickey...

131
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:28,528
I want my pockets to be filled with cash.

132
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:31,129
Let's take Keyes' money, Michael.

133
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:35,767
So.

134
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:38,887
How do you feel about playing
the prodigal son then?

135
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:41,647
Well?

136
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:51,452
Stacie, find out as much as possible
about Keyes'past.

137
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,366
The details will help convince him
that Danny is his son.

138
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,927
These old articles talk about
a vicious armed robber...

139
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,766
into everything from extortion
to protection rackets.

140
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:32,845
But once Keyes gets out of jail,
he reinvents himself.

141
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:35,572
Suddenly he's about as dangerous
as Delia Smith.

142
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:37,883
Well, I reckon she's got a dark side.

143
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,406
Salmon nibble?

144
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,923
One theory is that he swindled some
of his old compadres out of money.

145
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:45,526
The kidnap was revenge.

146
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:48,252
Okay. So how do we usually get a mark?

147
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,891
We appeal to their greed.

148
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,168
This bloke's not looking
to make money, is he?

149
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:54,562
He's looking to give it away.

150
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:56,132
So we spin him a sob story.

151
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:57,692
Will that be enough?

152
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:01,561
You see giving Danny the money
has to be his idea.

153
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:10,612
What you got in there?

154
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,649
Got luncheon meat. Obviously.

155
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:16,207
-That's on the turn.
-Yeah, that's how I like it.

156
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,567
Who's Albert with?

157
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,723
-His new best friends.
-Oh, yeah.

158
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,851
Yeah, bunch of cab drivers
he met this morning.

159
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:28,331
Three jacks.

160
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:32,650
-Happens to the best of them.
-Yeah. It does.

161
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,563
Four kings.

162
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:36,847
You lose, old-timer.

163
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:40,487
-Go again?
-Soon. I hope.

164
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,248
So, he's had a few, then?

165
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,324
Yeah. He's been here a while.

166
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,968
A rose in a bed of thorns.

167
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,532
We keep away from blokes on a hot streak
unless we got another deck up our sleeve.

168
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,052
Albert?

169
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:06,767
Look, mate, gambling's
not going to bring Gil back.

170
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:08,652
Have you called Keyes yet?

171
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:17,243
No, I don't wish to make a reservation.
I wish to speak to Mr. Keyes.

172
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,327
Yeah, Father O'Brien.

173
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:23,125
Of course there's nothing like
a wine tasting en primeur.

174
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:26,011
I've just come back from
a chateau in Burgundy.

175
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,082
Top stuff.

176
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:31,642
No.

177
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,401
Of course, it's all bloody show. Still.

178
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,131
I'm a sucker for the grape.

179
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:38,005
Who'd you say you were again?

180
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:40,012
Chris.

181
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:43,972
I run Family Ties.
We help reunite estranged families.

182
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:45,851
I don't know anything about wine.

183
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,889
Only about 200 people in this country do.

184
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,487
Sammy here accounts
for about three of them.

185
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,404
So the priest sent you, then?

186
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:55,690
He called us about three years ago.

187
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:57,923
Trying to locate his real family.

188
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:03,049
I'm talking about James. Your son.

189
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,806
I know this is difficult, but please
believe me when I say--

190
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,690
There's no way.

191
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,402
The priest makes one call
and finds my son just like that?

192
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:15,845
All right.

193
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:20,964
Call us when you're ready.

194
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:41,206
Hello, is that Jobseekers?

195
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,649
Yes, I'm wondering if you could help me.
I'm looking for some enthusiastic...

196
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,485
candidates with
a very good telephone manner.

197
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:26,046
James has been in and out
of foster homes since he was three.

198
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:29,172
He was illegally sold
to a childless couple...

199
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:31,608
who had a change of heart
and abandoned him.

200
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:35,083
He should have been identified as your
son, but unfortunately he wasn't.

201
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:38,208
I don't buy that you've found him.

202
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:43,890
He found you, Mr. Keyes.

203
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:45,850
Quite some time ago.

204
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:49,448
He didn't know if you'd want to see him.
But when Father O'Brien called us...

205
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,205
that's when James knew.

206
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:53,365
I'll be in touch.

207
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,331
I hope this brief role-play
has given you some idea...

208
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,802
of the environment you'd
be expected to work in.

209
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:07,568
Mr. Starkey will hand out questionnaires.
Please hand them back as you leave.

210
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:10,929
And we'll be in touch with the lucky
two we've chosen in due course.

211
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:12,287
Thank you for your time.

212
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:23,691
What is that?

213
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,849
Don't look in the cupboard.

214
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:36,723
Is it gonna jump out?

215
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:38,771
-Jesus!
-I warned you.

216
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:41,765
What do you think
the air freshener's are for?

217
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,011
Albie.

218
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,965
Nobody's going to the funeral.

219
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:50,044
But, Gil would have loved this.

220
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:53,045
He's being buried under the name
of Benedict Doonan.

221
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,886
Died a dentist. Buried a dentist.

222
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:59,124
So he doesn't get
his own name on his headstone?

223
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,850
-Bummer.
-What does it matter?

224
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:05,766
Who's gonna be there to cry for him?

225
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:12,965
What's eating Gilbert Grape?

226
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,647
Well, he won't admit it, but it's grief.

227
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,325
Hello, Chris speaking.

228
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:26,085
Yeah, no that's no trouble at all.
We can get that arranged. Yeah.

229
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,004
Okay, cheers.

230
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:34,446
That was Keyes' lawyer.

231
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,331
They want a blood test.

232
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,530
Organ courier. Theater. Which floor?

233
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,171
Your contact is?

234
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,845
Contact sheet's back in my panniers.

235
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,048
I wasn't told of a transplant.

236
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:54,806
Yeah, well sorry, love, but seeing as
you're not doing the operation...

237
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:57,407
maybe they didn't
make you a priority. Which floor?

238
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:00,485
-I'm afraid I can't let you through until--
-Right. Okay.

239
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:04,282
There's a fella upstairs the same color as
a canary and he's waiting for one of these.

240
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:08,651
On a slab. On a drip. Cut open. With a little
machine doing the job of his liver for him.

241
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:12,362
You want to ask him if he minds hanging
on a bit while I go and get my clipboard?

242
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,246
Thank you.

243
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:04,205
Staff. Excellent.

244
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:08,252
I'll need someone available to take a blood
sample for me in about half an hour.

245
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:12,042
Get me three chairs
and an internal phone...

246
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:15,603
and coffee, three sugars if you can.

247
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:19,089
The doctor...

248
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,002
is in.

249
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:28,488
Dr. Reef. Yes, he phoned to let us know.

250
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:31,167
-First floor and follow the signs.
-Cheers.

251
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,250
This is all rather unorthodox.

252
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:45,327
Protocol is to send
these results in the post.

253
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:48,201
But since you insist on knowing now.

254
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:49,567
Let's have it.

255
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,167
We compared the DNA from your sample
to that of James Haworth.

256
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:59,483
The relative chance of paternity
is 99.99%.

257
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:02,372
So James....

258
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,569
It is as beyond doubt as it can be.

259
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,011
He is your son, Mr. Keyes.

260
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,971
I want a second opinion.

261
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:11,442
I'm sorry?

262
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,251
I want it reconfirmed. Now.

263
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,365
-Well, you can see the results.
-It's the way I do things.

264
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:19,364
You get another doctor in. Now.

265
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:22,604
Well, I'm not sure I can just pull
a colleague off the corridor.

266
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:24,888
If it'll put Mr. Keyes' mind at rest, Doctor.

267
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:30,926
Very well.

268
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:55,765
Do you want a cup of something?

269
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:58,811
He's been ages. He's made a cock-up.
I knew this wasn't right.

270
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,448
Yeah, think I agree.

271
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,208
What, we're going?

272
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:07,602
Well, it's not doing you any good
pacing up and down here.

273
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:10,366
Besides, they can always send
the second opinion in the post.

274
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:14,241
-Do you really think we should go?
-It's your call. You're in the driving seat.

275
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:17,562
I'm here to unite people not alienate them.

276
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,571
Five more minutes.

277
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:21,287
Okay.

278
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,843
This is Dr. Mansfield.

279
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:30,166
Dr. Mansfield, I will show you
these two DNA results.

280
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:32,371
Your assessment, please.

281
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:37,205
99.99% match, Doctor.

282
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,443
-They're related?
-Yes.

283
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,366
I need a drink.

284
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:45,762
You did very well.

285
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,844
-So am I a doctor now?
-Definitely.

286
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:52,165
Do I get to do operations? I'd like to
operate on a heart, or an eye, or a lung.

287
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:56,041
Steady, these pre-meds can
really give you the wobbles.

288
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,407
Or a brain.

289
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,245
Yeah, let's get you back to bed.

290
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:02,570
God, the things I do for you guys.

291
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:04,564
-You look cute.
-Yeah, you look fantastic.

292
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,042
Juliette Keyes.
She's on to her third husband.

293
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,010
She'll want to know what
you're after financially.

294
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:11,482
Yeah, but the blood test confirms it,
doesn't it? I'm his son.

295
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:13,768
But still, I'll be there to stage-manage.

296
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:16,447
-Okay, you look great, let's go eat.
-Just looking.

297
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:23,162
Thank you.

298
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:26,331
It's okay, come on.

299
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:29,332
Right.

300
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:35,845
This is James.

301
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,366
Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy.

302
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:42,523
And this is Jimmy's missus-to-be, Paula.

303
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:46,049
This is an amazing place.
Isn't it amazing, Jimmy?

304
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,691
Yeah. It's amazing.

305
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:49,286
I'm Juliette.

306
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,129
Handsome devil isn't he, Johnny.

307
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:54,329
So you found us all right, then?

308
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:55,562
Yeah.

309
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,530
Well, it took a few years.

310
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,051
The important thing...

311
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:08,648
at this very early stage is not to worry
about any doubts or fears or anything.

312
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,531
Just, you know, be patient.

313
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:18,649
It's an amazing place, this.

314
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:20,769
You got to keep ahead
in the restaurant game.

315
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:24,926
Customers will eat the food, but when
it comes to other chefs, it's dog eat dog.

316
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:27,404
Cost us everything, this place.

317
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:31,812
It's amazing.

318
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,563
Keep the menus brief, that's the trick.

319
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:37,484
People want to be told what to eat.

320
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:39,131
So what are you cooking, Jimmy?

321
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:41,204
Well, I'm just at Burger Chef right now.

322
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:44,205
But I've done stints in some
fancy places, ain't I?

323
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:46,932
-Yeah.
-Lamb and apple tatties.

324
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:50,164
That's one of mine, with a spicy fig sauce.

325
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,684
Saffron, roasties.

326
00:21:52,773 --> 00:21:54,684
You don't want to get too fancy.

327
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,207
Simple food tells its own story...

328
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:59,409
providing it's sauced right. Here.

329
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:00,682
Try that.

330
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,173
Don't dawdle, know your mind, Jimmy.

331
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:08,687
Are you taking the piss out of me
with this chowder?

332
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:11,606
On second thoughts, have you put
the piss in the chowder?

333
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:15,001
So.

334
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:17,482
You're mad about your food, Jimmy.

335
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:19,530
But have you got what it takes?

336
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:24,241
No, I am dreadfully sorry, sir. Yeah, but l--

337
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:27,490
Sir, shouting at the maitre d'
doesn't alter the fact that there is...

338
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:30,883
a four-week waiting list
for Sunday lunch. Goodbye.

339
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:32,722
Some people.

340
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:37,730
-Wow, four weeks?
-Eight weeks for a Saturday night.

341
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:42,211
We always keep a couple of tables on
stand-by for those last minute celebs.

342
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:45,043
What you doing out here
on your Ionesome?

343
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,811
Two's company, a social worker's a crowd.

344
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:52,323
We're not being wound up, are we, Chris?

345
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,689
He isn't a gold-digger, is he? Because
we've had someone try it on before.

346
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:58,048
-No, Jimmy's for real.
-Well, he'd better be.

347
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:00,169
Or knowing Johnny, God help him.

348
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,851
Makes no odds how much you
pay for your Chateaubriand...

349
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,491
the bins still stink.

350
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:08,370
Yeah, I suppose so.

351
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:12,844
I'm going to put a visible wine cellar
out here, behind a glass partition.

352
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,003
Beautiful thing, a good cellar.

353
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:17,126
Sounds fantastic...

354
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,327
Mr. Keyes.

355
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:20,971
Call me Johnny, at least.

356
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,282
So.

357
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:26,164
You want to open a gastro-pub.

358
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:28,528
Well, that's the plan.

359
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:31,525
I mean, that's a long way off.

360
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,567
So did Mom suffer much before she died?

361
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:38,052
Your mom?

362
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,652
No. It was quick.
The cancer was all through her.

363
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:45,328
We were separated by then.
The family didn't let me go to the hospital.

364
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:46,812
Just the funeral. Bastards.

365
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,123
I wasn't angry. I didn't cry.

366
00:23:49,213 --> 00:23:52,683
When you come from nowhere
you learn pride. No weakness, yeah?

367
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:55,048
Look.

368
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,284
Tomorrow night. In here. A family party.

369
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:03,007
Come on, yes or no. What's the matter?

370
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:07,885
Yeah, all right, then. Yeah, tomorrow.

371
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:13,252
I tell you now, if he could, he'd hand me
the whole business on a plate today.

372
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:16,167
-I don't think so.
-What are you talking about?

373
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:20,007
There's a connection but there's
no bond. You need to bond, Danny.

374
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,128
What?

375
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,169
Why don't you give him a kiss?

376
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:28,642
Oh, yes.

377
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:32,002
Eddie's aunt's attic.

378
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:34,448
Hasn't been cleaned since Everton won
the FA Cup.

379
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:37,525
Killer cobwebs.
Sticky, with those little bits of grit.

380
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:41,488
It's very nice, yeah.

381
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:43,211
We need to beef Danny up.

382
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:46,202
Book a table at K's for tomorrow night.

383
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:48,725
Eight-week waiting list.

384
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:49,802
Problem?

385
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:51,482
Nope.

386
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,242
Hey, guys.

387
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,530
Guys, you wouldn't be interested
in having your picture snapped...

388
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:01,285
with Justin Timberlake, would you?

389
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:04,763
Yeah, I got the nod he's eating at K's,
and the pics always look better...

390
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:07,651
with a little bit of a crowd, you know?
Go on. Off you go.

391
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:10,327
Go on quickly. We love Justin!
Off you go. Come on.

392
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,046
Just around the corner. Go quickly.

393
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:21,768
Will you please leave right now!

394
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:23,726
I don't want to have....

395
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,452
Listen to me, I don't want
to call the police. Now go!

396
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,171
Excuse me.

397
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:30,767
When I book a table
I ask for discretion to the max.

398
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:34,209
Why do you think Mr. Timberlake is
choosing to dine out of the West End?

399
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:37,171
-I don't understand.
-Justin Timberlake, you moron.

400
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:39,687
He's not in the book.
I can check with Ms. Keyes.

401
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:42,492
No, Justin doesn't do books.
He comes in under the wire.

402
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,006
Not under my wire, sir.

403
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,402
I'll tell you what we'll do, then.
Don't get the table ready.

404
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:49,371
Instead we'll wait in the foyer here
with the adoring hordes...

405
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:52,251
so you can explain it all to Justin
and his people when he arrives.

406
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,449
Just doesn't look good
for a place like this, does it?

407
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:57,730
Well, I can assure you, sir, this publicity
leak had nothing to do with us.

408
00:25:57,813 --> 00:26:00,566
The hard-core ones pick it up
off the fan sites. What can you do?

409
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:03,121
I'll take the table and tell Justin's driver
to delay for an hour.

410
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,805
Justin's a regular guy. He'll understand.

411
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:08,283
Nothing by a window,
no place settings facing west. Lead on.

412
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:22,046
Who is he and why has he got
a table for four on his own?

413
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,651
All right. Look after him.

414
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:30,009
But tell the kitchens to check
his face against the wanted list.

415
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:34,485
-What's a ''wanted list''?
-We have photos in the kitchen...

416
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:38,327
so the staff can spot the restaurant
critics and the Michelin inspectors.

417
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:40,643
It helps the monkeys know
who the hunters are.

418
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,486
So why waste your life
frying burgers, Jimmy?

419
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:46,326
Well, it's regular bunce, isn't it? You know.

420
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:48,324
We got a wedding to think about,
haven't we.

421
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:50,290
Sod that. What about your pride?

422
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:54,082
Sparkling water with a twist of lime,
and can you get this butter softened?

423
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:55,686
It's like a slab of ice.

424
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:59,083
So where you gonna get
the money for this gastro-pub?

425
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:00,322
Well...

426
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:03,530
-once the banks know they can trust us--
-Banks?

427
00:27:03,613 --> 00:27:06,923
Crooks with pens in their pockets.
Trust me, I know.

428
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,723
Well, how else are we
gonna get the capital?

429
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:12,281
-You can't let them run you.
-Waiter.

430
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:15,248
The split-pea soup's watery
and the Neuf-du-Pape...

431
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,130
at least two degrees
above ambient temperature.

432
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:18,771
Do you have any idea....

433
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:21,447
Forget it, just bring my lamb casserole.

434
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:30,890
Don't tell me you've lost your nerve
after yesterday.

435
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:41,809
So how'd you two meet?

436
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:45,602
-We just got chatting in a bar.
-Surprised he had the nerve.

437
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:49,242
-Well, how'd you mean?
-He's a cracking boy, but he's shy.

438
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:52,402
Some people ain't suited
for the cut and thrust.

439
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:55,530
You! Here. Now.
This lamb tastes like boiled dog.

440
00:27:55,613 --> 00:27:56,648
Get rid of it.

441
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:02,245
Johnny Keyes. There's a problem?

442
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,086
My God, were you born with such
perception or did you learn it from...

443
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:07,448
-some ancient Chinese master?
-lf you're dissatisfied--

444
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,922
I'm a major player in the entertainment
world and I know a lot of critics.

445
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:12,971
-Excuse me.
-One word from me and this place...

446
00:28:13,053 --> 00:28:14,088
Wait. No, Jimmy, don't.

447
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:17,051
...will be on the receiving end of a
review with three of my favorite words:

448
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:20,284
''nauseating,'' ''heinous,'' and ''putrid.''

449
00:28:20,813 --> 00:28:25,603
If you don't shut up, it's not the food
that you're gonna be complaining about.

450
00:28:25,693 --> 00:28:27,251
Call off the whelp.

451
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:30,291
Unless you want this dump black-listed
by the likes of Beyonce.

452
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:33,729
Johnny Keyes built this place up
from nothing.

453
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:38,443
People like you only have a talent
for pissing on other people's hard work.

454
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:42,162
Well go on, mate. Go and get your friend,
go and write your review.

455
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,609
All right? And then wait to see the
letter that lands on your doorstep...

456
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:48,207
which will have my three favorite words:

457
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,932
''libelous,'' ''unsubstantiated''...

458
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:52,647
and ''court-case.''

459
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,166
''Court case'' is two words.

460
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:58,212
Yeah, well I used a bloody hyphen!

461
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,803
I don't know who you are.

462
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:03,690
But you just made a big mistake.

463
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:07,402
No, he didn't. Now make like one.

464
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:14,365
And I'll tell you who he is.
He's my son. My long lost son.

465
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:16,484
Champagne for everyone!

466
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:19,886
My son is home. Yes.

467
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:30,364
Monkey to see me, old-timer.

468
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,690
You have cleaned me out.

469
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,122
Here.

470
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:46,403
It's real silver.

471
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:47,049
Come on, Jimmy. Let's get a drink.

472
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:51,806
He wants us to stay the night.

473
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,292
So?

474
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:54,971
Where am I gonna sleep?

475
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,248
Who'd you think you are, Sister Wendy?

476
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,369
You're gonna be sleeping
with me, sweetie.

477
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:01,242
Fine.

478
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:04,131
So long as you remember
there's a no-fly zone.

479
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:06,044
Laugh at his jokes. Drink his drinks.

480
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:08,442
Just to keep being a chip
off the old block for Keyes. Okay?

481
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,330
Come on, Chris, mate.

482
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:11,528
What's going on?

483
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:15,766
Well, he's saying
he thinks that we should go.

484
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:17,730
I just think it's too much, too soon.

485
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:21,169
How can it be too much?
I've missed out on the last 32 years.

486
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:22,322
Stay.

487
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:26,207
First one to get the picture card...

488
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:28,332
gets the bed.

489
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:37,202
You all right?

490
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,971
Yeah.

491
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:51,652
St. Balthazar.

492
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,963
Patron saint of card players.

493
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:59,006
I should've lit a candle to him
before I took on that cabbie again.

494
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:02,608
The bloke's on hot streak.
I told you, stay away or load the deck.

495
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:03,682
Yeah.

496
00:32:05,813 --> 00:32:08,008
Tell me, is Danny making a good son?

497
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,685
Yeah, perfect son.

498
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:15,485
Do you ever wish that you had kids, Ash?

499
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:20,529
Well, it's the life we sign up for, isn't it?

500
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,362
What about you?

501
00:32:24,173 --> 00:32:29,008
The way Mickey talks to Danny reminds
me of the way I used to talk to Mickey.

502
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:30,967
Yeah, I know.

503
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:35,364
You know there's a horrible point
in your life when you realize...

504
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,763
that you've got nothing
to teach the younger ones...

505
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:41,811
except through your mistakes.

506
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:47,130
-But when I die--
-No, don't start.

507
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:49,966
No, when I die, I'm gonna die rich.

508
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:53,527
And I don't want any eulogies...

509
00:32:53,613 --> 00:32:55,331
or tears.

510
00:32:56,093 --> 00:32:59,642
I just want people to say,
''There lies Albert Stroller.

511
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:01,930
''He couldn't take it with him.

512
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:04,448
''But by thunder...

513
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:07,286
''at least he has it all on him.''

514
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,444
You can cheat anyone out of anything.

515
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,730
I think you'll cheat Death and live forever.

516
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:17,610
Don't be flippant.

517
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:22,365
I'll still be chasing the cons
when I fall off my perch.

518
00:33:23,773 --> 00:33:25,365
You're gambling too much.

519
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:28,206
-Don't do it to yourself, mate.
-Shut up and leave me alone.

520
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:30,443
Gil was your friend
and you miss him, I know--

521
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,091
I said leave me alone!

522
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,020
That's probably Keyes...

523
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,748
thinking about us...

524
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,984
doing it.

525
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,104
We shouldn't disappoint him
then, should we?

526
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,860
I mean I am supposed
to be a chip off the old block.

527
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,985
Danny.

528
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,300
Yeah, I'm thinking that's
a very good point.

529
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,299
-I gotta close the deal.
-No.

530
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,984
Yeah, I'm gonna close the deal.

531
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,061
Paula, do you think we should?

532
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,582
Okay, then, you're insatiable, ain't you?

533
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,941
I love it when you make those noises.

534
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,068
Night, then.

535
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,947
Good night.

536
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,067
I want to give you two some money.

537
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,623
Mr. Bombastic has done it again.

538
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,788
Danny.

539
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,750
If I could speak to you right now
across this table...

540
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,105
-what would I advise you to do?
-Give it a break.

541
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,909
Can we stop playing
Jedi master for two minutes?

542
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,745
Okay, it's working just dandy andy pandy.
He's offering. I should accept.

543
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,505
And what about her?

544
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,308
You never wanted his charity, Danny.

545
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,302
No, because you have your pride.
You want to make it on your own.

546
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,506
And that's why you're going
to turn his offer down.

547
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,423
-Just like we agreed, Danny.
-All right, then.

548
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,260
Now why don't you ask me...

549
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,342
what you're gagging to ask me?

550
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,305
No, I don't have to.
I know you two were faking last night.

551
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,778
Why?

552
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,189
It's a common mistake.

553
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,746
But no one has that good a time of it.

554
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,863
I made a judgment call, and I lost you.
It haunts me, Jimmy.

555
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,706
I can't make up for the last 32 years
but I can help you now.

556
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,742
I want to invest in your future.

557
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,549
Darling, don't you think
we should talk about this later?

558
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,701
You know I want to make it on my own.

559
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:04,227
Yeah, Jimmy's right. We want to
carve a life on our own terms. Our way.

560
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,988
What about this, then?

561
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,745
I come over to your place
and you cook me your pièce de résistance.

562
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,019
Cook for you?

563
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,188
And if your foods good enough,
then I'll invest.

564
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,899
-You'll come won't you, sweetheart?
-I've got a pedicure.

565
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,504
And I'll be tough on you.

566
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,820
'Cause I know that's what you want.

567
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,188
Look at that face. He loves the idea.

568
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,420
Tomorrow at 5:00. Your place.

569
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,539
My place?

570
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,418
Great, yeah, my place.

571
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,622
There's a lot of light.
But I expect you guys provide your own.

572
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,462
What's it called again?

573
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,383
Zombie Towers.

574
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,218
Block of flats. That's the gateway to Hell.

575
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,064
Now I don't think there's enough room
to run a dolly in here.

576
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:57,189
Hell, I may just have to ride
that bad boy on the crane.

577
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,864
Come up here through the window. Boom.

578
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,579
Now Mr. Eaves, we're wrestling
a very tight budget.

579
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,950
One month's lease is still
going to cost you two grand.

580
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,627
Let me crunch you some figures.

581
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,144
The net cost of the picture is 2.2 mil.

582
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,949
U.S. studio will pick up
North American rights for 3 mil.

583
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,225
A consortium will handle domestic
and European...

584
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,699
and a third party's gonna take care
of DVD and cable.

585
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,463
So we're looking to clear about 5 mil
before box office.

586
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,987
So you would think
that we have money to burn. But, alas, no.

587
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,859
The entire budget of this baby is
deferred against back-end profit.

588
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,140
It's still two grand. Take it or leave it.

589
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,705
I like you. You got cojones.

590
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,782
You should be producing pictures
instead of this faggot.

591
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,662
How would you like to be in one?

592
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,023
I thought you were kidding
when you mentioned it earlier.

593
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,383
No. You be here 11 a.m.,
on the 14th, and you...

594
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,303
are in the movie, Mr. Eaves.

595
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,506
We'll give you tickets to the premiere...

596
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:01,469
and all your pals can come
along and see you up on the big screen...

597
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,018
as one of the undead.

598
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,385
But, in return you waive the rent
until the movie is in profit.

599
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,109
It's called a ''satisfactory deferment.''

600
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,546
As zombie roles go, it's great.

601
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,304
You get to eat Amanda Donohoe.

602
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,379
Thank you.

603
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,424
Cheese.

604
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,868
So you tie your filo parcels
with the spinach strands.

605
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,349
And then you?

606
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,787
Then you drop them in oil.

607
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,782
That's searing hot oil, Danny.
Searing hot oil.

608
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,225
-You know this means a lot to him.
-What?

609
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,949
I mean a lot to him.
He thinks he's found his only son.

610
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,702
He's a bully and he loves himself.

611
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,668
He bounced back once, he'll do it again.
Hot oil.

612
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,743
Show me the pheasant.

613
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,068
Pheasant, come on.

614
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,465
-Danny, that should have infused.
-Infuse.

615
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,541
-Yeah, infuse the pheasant.
-Yeah, what's that say?

616
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,622
-I got it, haven't I. Already put infused.
-All right, fine. Good.

617
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,938
All right.

618
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,827
Which sauce do I use?

619
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,779
All of them.

620
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,101
-You don't think that's too much?
-No, trust me. It'll do the job perfectly.

621
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,499
Remember to infuse the pheasant.

622
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,700
Ash, we're getting tight for time.

623
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,144
How's it coming along?

624
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,347
It'll be a lot quicker if you
didn't keep phoning me. All right?

625
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,109
This is going to be close.

626
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,821
You going to the Wilson's party and all?

627
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,140
No. I'm visiting my son, Jimmy.

628
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,222
Jimmy and Paula? Top floor?

629
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,229
-Streuth, you'd best get climbing.
-Third floor.

630
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,544
Jimmy Haworth? Those your directions?

631
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:46,306
Oh yeah, it's not 301, it's 901.
That's their old address.

632
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,984
Don't I know you? Your voice, is familiar.

633
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:53,743
Well, I get that a lot. People say I sound
like Michael Caine.

634
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,262
-Do they?
-Yeah.

635
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,466
I'm not waiting for this death trap,
I'm taking the bloody stairs.

636
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,544
You used to live in 901
and then you moved to 301.

637
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,580
Numb-nut sent me to the top floor.

638
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,388
He's got it the wrong way round.

639
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,428
We used to live on the ninth
but there was plumbing problems.

640
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,023
-How are you, Mr. Keyes?
-Hello.

641
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,419
Still feel you can't leave us on our own?

642
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,223
No, got no life of me own, mate.

643
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,870
This is our way of saying thank you
to Chris as well.

644
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,781
You shouldn't have done all this.

645
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,384
We wanted it to be perfect.

646
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,942
-Hi, I hope you brought an appetite.
-Where was this taken?

647
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,744
That was Eastbourne. Weren't it, love?

648
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,309
Just after we got engaged.

649
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,904
You alright, Johnny?
You're looking a little bit peaky.

650
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,550
Nothing a good supper won't cure.
What are we eating?

651
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,541
Okay, now you got to bear in mind that...

652
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,098
I am working in the confines of
a very small domestic kitchen.

653
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,464
Don't give me that.

654
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,338
Come on, Johnny, you know better than
to go poking round another chef's kitchen.

655
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,502
Here, you sit down.
I'll get you a nice drink.

656
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,621
You need to get yourself a girlfriend.

657
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,148
He's never happier than when
he's playing in that kitchen.

658
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,785
Hot oil. Hot oil.

659
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,979
That's in case he gets a puncture.

660
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,581
All right for some.

661
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,349
What's that smell?

662
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,941
It's, well, roasting some garlic.

663
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,021
Roasting or obliterating?

664
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,029
Well done, babes.

665
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,820
All right, bon appétit.

666
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,830
Took my inspiration here from...

667
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:01,540
the Catalonian gypsy way
of cooking the dish.

668
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,741
Which is to present the bird...

669
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:07,823
as over-basted.

670
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,548
That's what I like to call...

671
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:12,069
''Peasant Pheasant.''

672
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,862
It looks really good.

673
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,464
Shall I carve?

674
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,142
Try the sauce.

675
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,223
What do you think's in it?

676
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,942
Too much.

677
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,860
Right, anyone care for a brandy?

678
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,019
No, I'm fine.

679
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:49,179
Well, I'd love one.

680
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,862
Why not?

681
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,260
I don't suppose you could reach
up to the top shelf could you, Johnny?

682
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,302
This bottle's empty.

683
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,148
Well I'll just nip over
to the offy then, shall I?

684
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,504
Won't take me five minutes.

685
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,150
Lovely, sweetheart,
would you go with her, Chris?

686
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,508
Yeah, yes. Is anything wrong?

687
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:14,148
We'll clear the table for you.

688
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,782
There's a lot of me in you.

689
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,864
You got the dreams, and you got
the patter, and you got the pride.

690
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,623
And you got the bullshit. I should know.

691
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,826
I wanted to say this to you in private.

692
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,060
And I'll do you the honor
of speaking plainly.

693
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,183
You ain't got it, son.

694
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,228
You're passionate about your food
and you can rustle up a meal.

695
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,743
But you ain't got it.

696
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,628
If I had a proper kitchen.
You know, if I had the right gear.

697
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,622
A good chef can whip up
a gourmet meal on a hot car bonnet.

698
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,905
You're slapdash about your ingredients.

699
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,662
You throw too many flavors at it.

700
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,945
Too many ingredients
and not enough skill.

701
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,543
Now, I could throw a load of cash
at you anyway.

702
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:01,144
But you wouldn't accept it...

703
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,341
because you got principles and pride.

704
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,024
And I respect that
more than you'll ever know.

705
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,147
-Look, Johnny.
-Come with me.

706
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,025
Hang on.
Let's just give them a few more minutes.

707
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,660
Where did you get this Madeira?

708
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,263
Where did you get it, Jimmy?

709
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,186
You know the day I tracked them down...

710
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:35,703
those people that
I thought were my parents...

711
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,306
they wouldn't even let me in the house.

712
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,579
That's when I found out
that they'd dumped me.

713
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,304
They paid the kidnappers good money
for me, only to realize that I was...

714
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,785
your boy. That was it.

715
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,862
They didn't want me anymore.

716
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,346
I came back that night.

717
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,502
I was so angry.

718
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,139
So...

719
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,824
I just trashed the place.

720
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,986
Why did you take the bottle?

721
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,109
Because of the lion.

722
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,778
Lions were my first memory.

723
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,180
Guess that's where I get all my pride from.

724
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,344
Samuel?

725
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:35,263
It's a molded bottle. Early 20th century.
You can see the seam.

726
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,743
Here on the back. ''B 1936 HMS.''

727
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:44,221
It's a 1936 Boal vintage
produced by H.M. Sortiz.

728
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,138
No revenue stamp.

729
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,069
I don't get it.

730
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,222
The stopper cork has no wax cover.
But that's not surprising...

731
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,666
the cork itself has been infested.
Maggots got right into it.

732
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:59,667
The wine itself is lying low shoulder.

733
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:00,939
It's undrinkable.

734
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,942
But then, you'd never dream
of opening this Madeira.

735
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,585
Why not?

736
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:09,185
This particular vintage was
transferred to the Spanish mainland...

737
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,785
and bottled there. Probably given
the name of the ship that brought it.

738
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,179
Leon. The Lion.

739
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:19,379
But it's the etching here,
in the glass itself.

740
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,108
Now that's amazing.

741
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,342
''F.F.''

742
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,179
So?

743
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:31,387
What you are holding is a Madeira that
was presented...

744
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,779
to General Francisco Franco.

745
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,340
On the day he was made
commander-in-chief of the Spanish Army...

746
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,307
in October, 1936.

747
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,459
''F.F.''

748
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,906
Those scum you thought were your
parents bought this as an investment.

749
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,629
Now, it's your investment.

750
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:48,666
This bloke's not looking
to make money, is he?

751
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,786
He's looking to give it away.

752
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,428
So we spin him a sob story.

753
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:53,909
But will that be enough?

754
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:57,665
Because giving Danny the money
has to be his idea.

755
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,389
I mean, that should convince him
more than any blood test.

756
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,984
So the son persuades him
to invest in a restaurant.

757
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,184
That will mean that I got to learn to cook...

758
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,943
which does sound far too much
like hard work.

759
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,464
We need him to pay up in cash.

760
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:17,906
So, is it worth a few quid?

761
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,264
Oh, yeah.

762
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,178
I ain't felt this ruddy good in years.

763
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,308
You and Paula deserve a start in life
and you deserve something from me.

764
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,581
To make up for not being there for you.

765
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,228
You don't want handouts. Fine.

766
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,380
I'll buy this bottle of wine off you.

767
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,508
Call it 120?

768
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,866
-120 quid?
-120 grand.

769
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:50,540
It ain't charity, son. It's what it's worth.

770
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,349
I might even make a slim profit
at auction one day.

771
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:54,899
Yeah?

772
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,818
So you can give me
the money fair and square?

773
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:58,899
It's business.

774
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,666
A hundred and twenty grand?

775
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,823
I've seen that smile
on your face once before.

776
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,661
When you first held my little finger.

777
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,669
It's not too late for me
to be a dad to you, is it?

778
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,222
You and me, boy.

779
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,069
You and me.

780
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:20,779
We're kings.

781
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,947
Kings of the ruddy jungle.

782
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,065
Yeah.

783
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,339
Come on!

784
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,298
Johnny?

785
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,029
What's wrong?

786
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,062
It has to fool a trained eye.

787
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,387
Find a way of rotting the cork.

788
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:56,823
Get maggots into it.

789
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,263
Rancid meat should do it.

790
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,339
Age the bottle.

791
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,265
An expert will know if it doesn't feel right.

792
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,988
Every detail has to be perfect.

793
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,708
-Get it.
-No. Leave it.

794
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,901
-Save it.
-No. Leave it.

795
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,301
I don't want to die.

796
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,381
You're not gonna die.
I'm just gonna call an ambulance.

797
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,700
I've done.... I've been.... So many lies.

798
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,826
I've told so many lies.

799
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,021
Look, you did what you had to do,
didn't you?

800
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,180
You don't understand. I had the money.

801
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,259
What?

802
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,306
I had the ransom to pay the kidnappers.

803
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,618
But I kept it.

804
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:53,225
I called their bluff.
It was my money to get started.

805
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,778
I took a risk and I lost you.

806
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,345
'Cause I wanted the business.

807
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,223
Forgive me, son.

808
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,584
I'm a liar...

809
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,819
and a cheat.

810
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,583
Forgive me.

811
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,423
I forgive you...

812
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,339
Dad.

813
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,418
It was a work of art, Ash.

814
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,263
You all right, Danny?

815
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,461
I know he was a bully and a liar but...

816
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,220
I lied to him, too, didn't I?

817
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,468
The last thing he heard
before he died was a lie.

818
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,149
We don't just lie to people, Danny.

819
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,107
We tell them what they want to hear.

820
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,384
And for a moment...

821
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,828
they're truly happy.

822
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:01,226
So, can we see it, please?

823
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,869
Absolutely.

824
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,182
He rescued it, you know.
With his last ounce of strength.

825
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,709
He was a strong man.

826
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,587
Weak in other ways.

827
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:24,026
One hundred and twenty grand.

828
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,585
I'm doing this because
it's what Johnny wanted.

829
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:29,468
-Thanks for everything you've done.
-Now this is what I want.

830
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,824
I want you to leave.

831
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,470
Live your happy little lives
and don't bother me again.

832
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,029
I've got a business to sell off.

833
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,500
So why did you bother making a back-up?

834
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,583
As a back-up.

835
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:56,427
I'm sorry, Mickey.
I know I haven't been easy.

836
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,428
You lost a friend, Albert.

837
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,622
It's okay to grieve...

838
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,582
but don't shut us out.

839
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,505
You know, Keyes died well, didn't he?

840
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,181
Thinking that his son had forgiven him.

841
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:11,429
Maybe old Gil died well, too.

842
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,549
Doing what he loved.

843
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,869
I don't know, maybe I worry too much.

844
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,228
There is no destination in life.

845
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,426
The journey is everything.

846
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,259
What?

847
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:31,269
It's just, the things you come
out with sometimes, Albert.

848
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,986
You're still an inspiration, you know that?

849
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:35,904
Father figure?

850
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:40,620
I was thinking more grandfather figure.
Okay, what about guru?

851
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,507
Now guru, I like.

852
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,027
And there's nothing to be scared of.

853
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,503
