00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,320
<font color="white">Why is it the more you have to say,</font>
<font color="white">the harder it is to speak?</font>

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,600
<font color="white">Should take a shower.</font>

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,360
<font color="white">My heart's beating in my face.</font>

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,520
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,800
<font color="cyan">Thanks.</font>

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,200
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
<font color="white">That's James.</font>

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
<font color="yellow">Oh, wow.</font>

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,880
<font color="yellow">I'm going to finish cashing up.</font>

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
<font color="white">DOOR CLOSES</font>

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,360
<font color="white">Have you been following me?</font>

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,520
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,040
<font color="cyan">Did you get one of these?</font>

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,240
<font color="white">Shit.</font>

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,560
<font color="white">Is that what you came here</font>
<font color="white">to tell me?</font>

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,800
<font color="cyan">Er... Yeah.</font>

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,400
<font color="white">That's it?</font>

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,400
<font color="cyan">Well, don't you think</font>
<font color="cyan">it's a bit sinister?</font>

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,800
<font color="white">Not really.</font>

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
<font color="white">It's probably some dickhead</font>
<font color="white">we went to school with.</font>

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,120
<font color="white">You shouldn't have come here, James.</font>

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,400
<font color="white">He looks old.</font>

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,000
<font color="white">What's wrong with your leg?</font>

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,000
<font color="cyan">Nothing.</font>

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
<font color="cyan">It's just a bit stiff.</font>

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,160
<font color="white">Right.</font>

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,960
<font color="cyan">My dad's dead.</font>

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,480
<font color="white">Shit.</font>

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
<font color="white">Sorry.</font>

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,120
<font color="white">I'm getting married tomorrow.</font>

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,320
<font color="cyan">I know.</font>

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,480
<font color="cyan">Congratulations.</font>

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,200
<font color="white">Is it bad that it's nice to see him?</font>

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,560
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you can't drive that.</font>

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
<font color="yellow">I'll get Eric</font>
<font color="yellow">to sort you out tomorrow.</font>

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,720
<font color="cyan">Thanks.</font>

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,480
<font color="yellow">Where are you staying?</font>
<font color="yellow">We'll give you a lift.</font>

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,600
<font color="cyan">Oh, no. It's fine.</font>

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,800
<font color="cyan">I can walk.</font>

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,800
<font color="white">Are you living in your car?</font>

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,920
<font color="yellow">He can stay in the cabin.</font>

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,600
<font color="yellow">Toilet's through there.</font>

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,920
<font color="cyan">Is there a shower?</font>

46
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,760
<font color="yellow">There's a lake.</font>

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,920
<font color="cyan">Thank you.</font>

48
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,880
<font color="white">PHONE CHIMES</font>

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,160
<font color="yellow">Eric says he'll drop your car off</font>
<font color="yellow">tomorrow afternoon.</font>

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
<font color="cyan">Is there a cash machine nearby?</font>

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,360
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
<font color="yellow">I'll be outside.</font>

53
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,400
<font color="white">I'd invite you to the wedding, but</font>
<font color="white">that would probably be a bit weird.</font>

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,200
<font color="white">Bye.</font>

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
<font color="cyan">Bye.</font>

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,280
<font color="white">James?</font>

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,040
<font color="cyan">Yeah?</font>

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,520
<font color="white">Tomorrow, when the car's fixed,</font>
<font color="white">you will leave, won't you?</font>

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
<font color="cyan">Er... Yeah.</font>

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,280
<font color="white">You shouldn't have come here.</font>

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,400
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry.</font>

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,880
<font color="white">I'm sorry about your dad.</font>

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,040
<font color="green"># If I should leave you</font>

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,280
<font color="green"># Try to remember the good times</font>

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,280
<font color="green"># Warm days filled with sunshine</font>

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,920
<font color="green"># And just a little bit of rain</font>

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,320
<font color="green"># And just a little bit of rain... #</font>

69
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,440
<font color="cyan">I definitely preferred being shot.</font>

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,640
<font color="green"># And if you look back... #</font>

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,160
<font color="white">I feel weird.</font>

72
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
<font color="white">Really weird.</font>

73
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,640
<font color="green"># Try to forget the bad times</font>

74
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,400
<font color="green"># Lonely, blue and sad times</font>

75
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,720
<font color="green"># And just a little bit of rain. #</font>

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,080
<font color="white">HORN HONKS</font>

77
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,200
<font color="white">Oh, my God!</font>

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
<font color="yellow">Jesus!</font>

79
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,440
<font color="green">Do you like it?</font>

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,840
<font color="white">Sometimes, you can choose</font>
<font color="white">to not be a dick.</font>

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,240
<font color="white">Yes. Thank you.</font>

82
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,000
<font color="cyan">At first, it felt nice,</font>
<font color="cyan">just being near Alyssa again,</font>

83
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,880
<font color="cyan">despite the circumstances.</font>

84
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
<font color="cyan">But that feeling didn't last.</font>

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,680
<font color="cyan">Mainly because the circumstances</font>

86
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,080
<font color="cyan">were her getting married</font>
<font color="cyan">to someone else.</font>

87
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,600
<font color="green">I am so proud of you!</font>

88
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,480
<font color="white">It's like being a pony at a show.</font>

89
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,040
<font color="white">Am I making a mistake?</font>

90
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,840
<font color="green">What? What are you talking about?!</font>

91
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,920
<font color="white">Nothing.</font>

92
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,360
<font color="white">Everyone probably has doubts</font>
<font color="white">right now.</font>

93
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,840
<font color="white">I think that's normal.</font>

94
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,280
<font color="cyan">Good afternoon</font>
<font color="cyan">and warm welcome to you all...</font>

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,920
<font color="cyan">Do you take Todd Alan King</font>
<font color="cyan">to be your lawful wedded husband?</font>

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,960
<font color="white">I can't believe I didn't know</font>
<font color="white">his middle name was Alan.</font>

97
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,400
<font color="yellow">What's that, then?</font>

98
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,720
<font color="cyan">It's my dad.</font>

99
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,440
<font color="cyan">Do you not have a truck?</font>

100
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

101
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,760
<font color="cyan">Do you want a lift somewhere?</font>

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,360
<font color="yellow">Nah, you're all right.</font>

103
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,560
<font color="white"># Love, won't you listen</font>

104
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,360
<font color="white"># To my heart? #</font>

105
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,360
<font color="white">TYRES SCREECH</font>

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,720
<font color="white"># Darling, can you hear it</font>

107
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,160
<font color="white"># Beating hard?</font>

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,640
<font color="white"># Gonna walk you down...</font><font color="cyan"> #</font>

109
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,240
<font color="cyan">Hey.</font>

110
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,640
<font color="white">Let's get out of here.</font>

111
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
<font color="cyan">OK.</font>

112
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,720
<font color="white"># One more time</font>

113
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,560
<font color="white"># Cos you're not the kind to rely on</font>

114
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,960
<font color="white"># I gave you my love</font>
<font color="white">but you threw it away. #</font>

<font color="yellow">with me?</font>

117

<font color="yellow">mash your potatoes with me? #</font>

122
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
<font color="cyan">How was the wedding?</font>

123
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,360
<font color="white">Yeah, it was fine.</font>

124
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,680
<font color="cyan">That's... That's good.</font>

125
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,160
<font color="cyan">I was waiting for the right moment</font>
<font color="cyan">to tell Alyssa I loved her.</font>

126
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,920
<font color="white">What?</font>

127
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,560
<font color="cyan">Nothing.</font>

128
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,240
<font color="cyan">I decided to bide my time.</font>

129
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,640
<font color="white">How long have you been</font>
<font color="white">living in here?</font>

130

<font color="yellow">for me?</font><font color="cyan"> #</font>

136
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,600
<font color="cyan">So, where we going?</font>

137
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,200
<font color="white">What?</font>

138
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,800
<font color="cyan">Where do you want to go?</font>
<font color="white">I dunno, I just wanted to leave.</font>

139
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,680
<font color="cyan">What happened?</font><font color="white"> Look, can we not?</font>
<font color="white">I don't want to talk about it, OK?</font>

140
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,120
<font color="white">Being shit runs in my family.</font>
<font color="white">It's in my blood...</font>

141
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,560
<font color="white">..which means I can't help it.</font>

142
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
<font color="white">What are you going to do</font>
<font color="white">with your dad?</font>

143
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,120
<font color="white">Are you going to scatter him, or</font>
<font color="white">just carry him round like a mascot?</font>

144
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,400
<font color="cyan">I'm going to scatter him.</font>

145
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,960
<font color="white">Where?</font>

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,120
<font color="cyan">I had no idea.</font>

147
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,920
<font color="cyan">It's private.</font>

148
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,600
<font color="cyan">Are you cold?</font>

149
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,400
<font color="white">No.</font>

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
<font color="cyan">Are you hungry?</font>

151
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,440
<font color="white">Not really.</font>

152
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,320
<font color="cyan">I am.</font>

153
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
<font color="white">Fine.</font>

154
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,400
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

155
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,480
<font color="cyan">What?</font>

156
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,760
<font color="yellow">Happy wedding.</font>

157
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,760
<font color="white">We're not married.</font>

158
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

159
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,960
<font color="cyan">We've actually been to a funeral.</font>

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,160
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

161
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,080
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

162
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,200
<font color="white">I just thought I'd get</font>
<font color="white">a bit more wear out of this.</font>

163
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,760
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

164
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,520
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a couple of minutes.</font>

165
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
<font color="cyan">Alyssa was different.</font>

166
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,720
<font color="white">What the fuck am I doing here?</font>

167
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,680
<font color="cyan">It was like someone</font>
<font color="cyan">had taken her batteries out.</font>

168
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
<font color="cyan">Alyssa...</font>

169
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,760
<font color="white">Yeah?</font>

170
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,560
<font color="cyan">The letter I sent you...</font>

171
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,680
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry.</font>

172
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
<font color="white">What letter?</font>

173
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,680
<font color="cyan">When I realised</font>
<font color="cyan">she might not have got it,</font>

174
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,200
<font color="cyan">it felt like a weight had been</font>
<font color="cyan">lifted from my chest.</font>

175
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,360
<font color="white">Oh, yeah. That.</font>

176
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,600
<font color="cyan">Which seemed much heavier</font>
<font color="cyan">when it was put back.</font>

177
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,520
<font color="cyan">I'm really, really sorry.</font>

178
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,600
<font color="white">It was ages ago.</font>

179
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,360
<font color="white">I can't even remember what it said.</font>

180
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,880
<font color="white">"Dear Alyssa,</font>

181
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,240
<font color="white">"'I don't want to see you again,</font>
<font color="white">ever.</font>

182
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,240
<font color="white">"Because of you, I killed someone.</font>

183
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,920
<font color="white">"I can't ever take that back</font>
<font color="white">and it's made me hate you.</font>

184
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,640
<font color="white">"So, whatever you feel about me,</font>

185
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,320
<font color="white">"you should know</font>
<font color="white">that I don't feel it in return.</font>

186
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
<font color="white">"Please leave me alone.</font>

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,400
<font color="white">"Sincerely, James. PS..."</font>

188
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,920
<font color="green">"..good luck with everything."</font>

189
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
<font color="cyan">Yep.</font>

190
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,080
<font color="green">Do you maybe want to take that out?</font>

191
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,160
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

192
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,080
<font color="white">"Because of you, I killed someone."</font>

193
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,480
<font color="white">SHE CRIES OUT</font>

194
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,520
<font color="white">"I can't ever take that back</font>
<font color="white">and it's made me hate you."</font>

195
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,440
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry.</font>

196
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,840
<font color="white">It's fine.</font>

197
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,000
<font color="white">Shut up.</font>

198
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,360
<font color="cyan">Shall we go?</font>

199
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
<font color="white">We need to pay.</font>

200
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,520
<font color="cyan">I know.</font>

201
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,880
<font color="cyan">Shall we still go?</font>

202
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,640
<font color="white">You know, if you do a runner,</font>

203
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,640
<font color="white">the waiter or waitress</font>
<font color="white">usually has to pay out of the tips?</font>

204
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
<font color="cyan">Um, no, I didn't know that.</font>

205
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,920
<font color="yellow">Yeah, that's true.</font>
<font color="yellow">We're held responsible.</font>

206
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
<font color="cyan">Right.</font>

207
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
<font color="cyan">OK.</font>

208
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,400
<font color="yellow">Were you not going to pay?</font>

209
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,960
<font color="cyan">Er...no.</font>

210
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,640
<font color="cyan">No, of course we were.</font>

211
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,240
<font color="cyan">Keep the change.</font>

212
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,840
<font color="cyan">Alyssa...</font>

213
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,280
<font color="cyan">Alyssa.</font>

214
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,600
<font color="cyan">Alyssa!</font><font color="white"> What?!</font>

215
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,080
<font color="cyan">I just had to say it.</font>
<font color="cyan">There would never be a right time.</font>

216
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,680
<font color="white">What?</font>

217
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,200
<font color="cyan">I love you.</font>

218
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,640
<font color="white">I don't want to be here.</font>

219
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,280
<font color="cyan">I love you.</font>

220
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,600
<font color="white">I don't want to be anywhere.</font>

221
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,680
<font color="cyan">I love you.</font>

222
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,480
<font color="white">I think we should go back.</font>
<font color="white">This is stupid.</font>

223
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,080
<font color="cyan">W-Wait...what?</font>

224
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,320
<font color="white">Well, what are we doing, James?</font>
<font color="white">Where are we even going?</font>

225
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,480
<font color="cyan">I don't know. You came to me.</font>

226
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,360
<font color="white">I didn't come to you, you came</font>
<font color="white">to me. You were stalking me.</font>

227
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
<font color="cyan">I was not stalking you,</font>
<font color="cyan">I was watching you.</font>

228
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,720
<font color="white">That's still weird!</font>

229
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,720
<font color="cyan">But you said you wanted to leave.</font>

230
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
<font color="white">Well, now I want to go back!</font>

231
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,000
<font color="cyan">Why?</font>

232
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,360
<font color="white">Because I am married!</font>

233
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,600
<font color="cyan">W-What?</font>

234
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
<font color="cyan">You did it?</font>

235
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,360
<font color="white">I do.</font>

236
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,640
<font color="white">Yes!</font>

237
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,120
<font color="cyan">Alyssa, wait!</font><font color="white"> Oh, for fuck's sake!</font>

238
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,480
<font color="cyan">No! No!</font>

239
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,000
<font color="white">Hey!</font><font color="cyan"> Stop!</font>

240
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,240
<font color="white">Hey!</font>

241
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
<font color="white">Brilliant.</font>

242
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,400
<font color="cyan">Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no, no!</font>

243
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,160
<font color="white">Look, I know it was your home,</font>
<font color="white">or whatever,</font>

244
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,720
<font color="white">but you don't need to cry about it.</font>
<font color="white">It's just been towed.</font>

245
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,480
<font color="white">What's wrong with you?</font>

246
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
<font color="cyan">It's my dad.</font>

247
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,400
<font color="white">Oh, yeah.</font>

248
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
<font color="white">Shit.</font>

249
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,200
<font color="white">I am actually a bit cold now.</font>

250
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,320
<font color="white">Thanks.</font>

251
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,560
<font color="cyan">What if they've got rid of him?</font>

252
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,720
<font color="white">Come on.</font>

253
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,920
<font color="yellow">400 plus VAT.</font>

254
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,760
<font color="white">What?!</font><font color="yellow"> Shouldn't have parked it</font>
<font color="yellow">where you did.</font><font color="cyan"> I don't understand.</font>

255
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,520
<font color="cyan">There wasn't a sign or anything.</font>
<font color="yellow">Yeah, there will have been a sign.</font>

256
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,920
<font color="white">There wasn't a sign.</font>
<font color="yellow">There's always a sign.</font>

257
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,400
<font color="white">There fucking wasn't!</font>

258
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,920
<font color="yellow">Maybe you need glasses.</font>

259
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,640
<font color="white">Maybe you need a better job!</font>

260
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,080
<font color="white">I'm sorry.</font>

261
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
<font color="white">Look, we just got married.</font>

262
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,280
<font color="white">We're saving up for a honeymoon,</font>
<font color="white">we don't have a lot of money.</font>

263
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
<font color="white">Can you let it go,</font>
<font color="white">just this one time?</font>

264
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,600
<font color="yellow">It's cash only.</font>

265
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,360
<font color="cyan">Please, can I just get my dad?</font>

266
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,360
<font color="yellow">What?</font><font color="cyan"> He's dead. He's in the car.</font>

267
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,880
<font color="cyan">I d-don't mean his body. His ashes.</font>
<font color="cyan">His ashes are in the car.</font>

268
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
<font color="cyan">Look, we'll come back with</font>
<font color="cyan">the money, I promise.</font>

269
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,840
<font color="cyan">But, for now, can I just get him?</font>

270
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,240
<font color="yellow">He's in the car?</font>

271
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,040
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font><font color="yellow"> So he's safe.</font>

272
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,760
<font color="cyan">Well, yeah.</font><font color="yellow"> So, when you come back</font>
<font color="yellow">with the money...</font>

273
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,440
<font color="yellow">..he'll be there.</font>
<font color="cyan">No, you-you don't understand.</font>

274
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,440
<font color="cyan">Please!</font><font color="white"> James, it's cool.</font>

275
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,680
<font color="white">We'll come back.</font>
<font color="white">What time do you close?</font>

276
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,880
<font color="yellow">Five.</font>

277
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,760
<font color="white">OK. Come on.</font>

278
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,800
<font color="cyan">I don't have 400 plus VAT.</font>
<font color="white">Neither do I.</font>

279
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,880
<font color="cyan">Then what are we going to do?</font>

280
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,880
<font color="white">We're going to wait</font>
<font color="white">till five o'clock.</font>

281
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,920
<font color="white">How did he die, your dad?</font>

282
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,400
<font color="cyan">Heart attack.</font>

283
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,040
<font color="cyan">Bad diet, no exercise.</font>

284
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,720
<font color="white">Shit.</font>

285
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,320
<font color="white">It's probably how I'll go.</font>

286
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,880
<font color="cyan">Why did you get married?</font>

287
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,080
<font color="white">Because I wanted to.</font>

288
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,160
<font color="cyan">OK.</font>

289
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
<font color="white">Because I thought I wanted to.</font>

290
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,240
<font color="white">Because I had to do SOMETHING...</font>

291
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,400
<font color="white">..so I did that.</font>

292
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,240
<font color="white">Wake me up when it's time.</font>

293
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,880
<font color="cyan">OK.</font>

294
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,880
<font color="cyan">On paper,</font>
<font color="cyan">things looked quite bleak for me.</font>

295
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,960
<font color="cyan">I was a homeless orphan on the run</font>
<font color="cyan">with a married woman.</font>

296
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,600
<font color="cyan">But, no matter how bad life got...</font>

297
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,240
<font color="cyan">..there was always something good.</font>

298
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,880
<font color="cyan">You had to focus on the good.</font>

299
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,560
<font color="yellow"># Won't you stay a while?</font>

300
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
