1
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,951
- I'll get the tip.
- Thank you.

2
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,917
- Thanks, lad.
- Keep well.

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,479
- Cheerio.
- Bye.

4
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,751
Put the cleaver down, mate.
Everybody calm down, all right?

5
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,469
If you all want to chance it,
I'll tell you now, I've got a full house.

6
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,031
All in, right?

7
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,075
- You dropped this.
- Thank you very much.

8
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,718
Can I buy you a drink?

9
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,360
- All right, sure. Why not?
- What'll you have?

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,630
- Scotch, thanks very much.
- Scotch.

11
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,675
All right!

12
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,109
Busy?

13
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,792
Ash. There are easier ways
to earn a living.

14
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,595
Mickey.

15
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,119
How good!

16
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,476
Have I missed you or what?

17
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,674
- How's life in the fast lane?
- It's good.

18
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,192
It's the only game in town.
If they're not eating a hamburger...

19
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,840
or fiddling with the CD player,
they're on the phone.

20
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,150
No one watches the road anymore.

21
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,229
Cheers, Eddie.

22
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,635
So what about you? How was it?

23
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,074
A new experience.
One I don't care to repeat.

24
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,878
So what now then?

25
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,910
I feel like one last score.

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,513
- Long or short?
- Long.

27
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,477
No one is playing the long con anymore.

28
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,269
They don't because they can't.
Come on, one last time.

29
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,115
Then I'll stop. I'll retire on my terms.
Not because I've been beat.

30
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,034
You know I can't do it without you.

31
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,509
- When do we start?
- Already have. Albert's got a mark.

32
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,194
But first things first.
Can you swing a hotel?

33
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,038
Can Pavarotti sing?

34
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,117
We've already got Stone
under surveillance.

35
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,634
- I understand that, sir.
- Then why the heavy mob?

36
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,678
We've had intelligence
Stone's next target is well connected...

37
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,193
plays golf with the Chancellor.

38
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,319
So he's got friends in high places.
Why don't you just warn him off?

39
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,958
Whilst we are keen to protect him...

40
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,032
we're even more keen
to see Stone put away again.

41
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,111
- Have I got a choice?
- No.

42
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,432
All right, listen up.

43
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,354
This is Detective Inspector
Martin DePalma from Central.

44
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,752
He's here to oversee
the Mickey Stone surveillance.

45
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,478
Give him what he wants.

46
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,552
- Any overtime comes through me first.
- Sir.

47
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,514
Sgt. Terri Hodges.
I've been heading up the surveillance.

48
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,359
Good. Then let's see what you've got.

49
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,151
All right, cheers.

50
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,874
<i>Ashley Morgan.</i>

51
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
Colloquially known as Ash
or "Three Socks."

52
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,274
- Three Socks?
- He got the name in prison.

53
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,874
After his first visit to the shower block.

54
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,475
He's a fixer. Whatever you want,
Ash Morgan will find it.

55
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,313
He got a skull fracture in a barroom brawl
10 years ago.

56
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,550
He uses it to work the flop.

57
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,999
Bounces over a car, goes to hospital...

58
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,038
x-ray shows the fracture,
insurance company pays out.

59
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,558
<i>Albert Stroller. Habitual gambler.</i>

60
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,350
Gee-gees, casinos, card games.
Albert plays them all. He's the roper.

61
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,830
He finds the marks, sucks them in,
and introduces them to the mob.

62
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,799
Usually plays the part of ex-serviceman
or retired banker.

63
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,350
In reality he was a shoe salesman
in the American Midwest.

64
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,115
Legend has it, when his store closed down
and the staff made redundant...

65
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,432
he conned the company out of $60,000
and shared it amongst his coworkers.

66
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,192
He fled to England in the '70s...

67
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,431
but by then he'd got the taste
and hasn't looked back since.

68
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,476
Once Stroller's got his mark...

69
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,789
<i>it's time to move up to the next level.</i>

70
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,553
<i>The insideman.</i>

71
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,237
<i>Michael Stone.</i>
<i>Also known as "Mickey Bricks."</i>

72
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,151
He's in a class all on his own.
A long con player. Never been convicted.

73
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,115
It is a matter of personal pride...

74
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,557
to every fraud investigator in the country,
to be the one who nails him.

75
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,758
Just finished his first spell in prison for
an unrelated crime. He served two years.

76
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,072
Rumors are, this is his last score.
We miss him this time, it's game over.

77
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,549
We think this is their next mark.

78
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,799
Peter Reginald Williams...

79
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,599
started a pharmaceutical business
in the early '80s.

80
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,353
His first wife Sara was from old money.

81
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,558
He used her family's connections in
the government to get research contracts.

82
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,835
- Where's the in?
- He is greedy.

83
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,955
- I'll get the tip.
- Thank you.

84
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,952
<i>Regularly makes the Top 500 rich list.</i>

85
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,796
<i>But would cross the street</i>
<i>to pick up £1 coin.</i>

86
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,875
He recently bagged himself
a new young wife.

87
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,192
But she's high maintenance
and spends his cash faster than he'd like.

88
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,073
He's generally a sucker for a pretty face.

89
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,756
Spends money to impress.
The shorter the skirt, the looser he gets.

90
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,435
Sounds like you really
warmed to this guy, Albert.

91
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,308
Yes. He's an objectionable little man,
with the morals of an alley cat.

92
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,311
That's marks for you.

93
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,232
This crew isn't about conning
little old ladies out of their pension.

94
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,550
They're strictly major league.

95
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,515
And remember, Mickey Bricks
thinks he's cleverer than us.

96
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,394
That there's no way we can catch him.

97
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,231
Let's prove him wrong.

98
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,873
Time to get an edge.

99
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,670
- Did I miss something?
- One phone call in two years.

100
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,154
Yeah, you know how I hate queuing.

101
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,270
I've got the crew together.

102
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,039
Everyone?

103
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,429
Albert?

104
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,233
We're on. Yeah, bring him in.

105
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,234
Don't tip him, Tony.
That service was shite.

106
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,272
- You've dropped your wallet.
- It's not mine.

107
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,351
That's a lot of money.

108
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,229
Let's see. "Mark Hamilton.
Clacy Hughes Associates."

109
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,589
What do you say? Finders keepers?

110
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,117
You are a card.
Let's see if he's staying here.

111
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,030
- We found this on the floor.
- I'll see Mr. Hamilton gets it, sir.

112
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,556
No, I don't think so.
Just tell us which room he's in.

113
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,878
- Who's she?
- Stacie Monroe.

114
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,392
She was married to short con artist
Jake Henry.

115
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,358
They worked the badger mostly.
Did well, too.

116
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,149
Then Jake took all their savings
and ran for the hills five years ago.

117
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,231
So much for honor amongst thieves.

118
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,470
Not to mention your wedding vows.

119
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,119
Word is, she and Stone had a thing once.
Before he met his wife.

120
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,831
Not just a pretty face. She's sharp.
Maybe even in Stone's league.

121
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,274
Who is it?

122
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,715
- Mr. Hamilton?
- Who wants to know?

123
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,434
We think we found something of yours.

124
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,639
Your wallet.

125
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,994
£3.50.

126
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,988
I'll give you two gos to find the lady.

127
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,237
- Yeah, right. £3.50.
- Take that.

128
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,749
Shouldn't you be somewhere, Danny?

129
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,796
Tell you what, I'll make it easy for you.

130
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,758
I'll take the Queen, turn the corner up.
Like that.

131
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,793
Here we go.

132
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,229
Choose. No money.
If you get it wrong, just buy me a drink.

133
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,515
- Same again, please.
- You're a very sick person.

134
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,431
Just naturally gifted.

135
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,395
You heard Mickey Bricks is out?

136
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,956
- Plays the long con, right?
- Top of the food chain.

137
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,037
So what? You reckon
he could teach me something?

138
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,311
What do I know?
All you guys freak me out.

139
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,074
But they say he's the best.

140
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,234
He's booked in the London Park Hotel.

141
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,670
- Yes, mate?
- Whiskey, please.

142
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,268
Thank you.

143
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,078
Here's to you, gentlemen.

144
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,072
I didn't think there were any
honest men left in the world.

145
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,594
- One or two.
- Here's to honest men.

146
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,198
- You must let me thank you properly.
- No. We wouldn't hear of it.

147
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,794
Even if it's only the cab fare home.

148
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,319
Excuse me.

149
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,753
Where were we?

150
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,118
I was trying to persuade you to take
something in return for your kindness.

151
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,034
It's a strange state of affairs
if one chap can't do a favor for another...

152
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,111
without money rearing its ugly head.

153
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,034
One day you may be in a position
to do something similar for us.

154
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,795
You know, I just might.
I have a suggestion.

155
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,751
A business associate has asked me
to make an investment for him tomorrow.

156
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,958
If you'll allow me,
I'll put in, say, £500 for you?

157
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,795
I'll take the £500 back,
you just get to keep the profit.

158
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,759
It'll have cost me nothing...

159
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,469
but at least I'll feel happier
knowing I've done something.

160
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,836
That sounds very generous.

161
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,875
Good.

162
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,079
Thank you.

163
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,310
This investment, can I ask what it is?

164
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,358
Just stocks and shares.
Nothing too exciting.

165
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,513
Fingers crossed.

166
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,275
I'm sure that won't be necessary.

167
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,553
- What do you think?
- Looks like a no-Iose situation to me.

168
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,312
My favorite kind.

169
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,751
They left about an hour ago.

170
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,150
Stroller dropped Williams off,
then went back to the hotel.

171
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,756
Hi, Mickey. Nice to... I was just...
Okay, all right, take care.

172
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,071
Hi, Mickey. How're you doing? Danny.
I was just...

173
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,391
This guy moves in high circles.

174
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,710
It'll take something special
to impress him.

175
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,472
That's exactly what he'll get.

176
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,028
As soon as Ash starts working his magic.

177
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,759
Have you ever thought of
a younger woman, Albie?

178
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,718
My dear, at my age, I think of little else.

179
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,829
Mr. Stone? Hi. Danny Blue.

180
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,033
Pleased to meet you.
You've probably heard of me.

181
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,318
No? All right. I'm not gonna mess
you about. I'll come straight to the point.

182
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,198
I know you're playing a score. I want in.

183
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,869
- In what?
- In. You know, in the game.

184
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,158
I want to learn. I really want to learn.
I'll just come inside for a little chat.

185
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,798
This is nice, isn't it?

186
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,551
I'm good. I can help you.
Think of it like that. I'll do that for you.

187
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,517
I know all the old plays.
What're you doing?

188
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,558
The Wire? No? The Rag? The Pay-Off?

189
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,915
You tell me once, that's it.

190
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,716
Bosh, it's in.

191
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,072
I bet you watched <i>The Sting,</i> too,
didn't you?

192
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,678
Never heard of it.

193
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,718
- You're not gonna shut the door, are you?
- Yeah, I thought I might.

194
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,555
So when do we pick them up?

195
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,308
We wait.

196
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,912
I want everything.

197
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,276
All the players, the money.
Nothing left to chance.

198
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,634
As far as we can make out...

199
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,632
Mickey Bricks doesn't have the money
to bankroll a con like this.

200
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,153
<i>They'll go out and try and raise</i>
<i>what they can with short cons.</i>

201
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,031
<i>They'll need a car, top of the range.</i>

202
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,633
<i>Not too flash,</i>
<i>but something that oozes class.</i>

203
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,359
Parking, sir?

204
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,915
- Here.
- Thank you.

205
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,598
<i>God help anyone</i>
<i>who runs into them today.</i>

206
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,239
I'm sorry.

207
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,799
£<i>24</i>0.

208
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,239
£1<i>2</i>5.

209
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,435
Enough?

210
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,351
- What about this place?
- Sorted.

211
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,793
Then it's enough.

212
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,558
As promised, gentlemen,
I invested the £500 on your behalf...

213
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,596
and this is the return.

214
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,875
I hope you're not disappointed.

215
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,311
There must be £1,000 here.

216
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,278
£1,950, to be precise.

217
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,359
- That's quite a return.
- I've had worse.

218
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,518
Made quite a killing yourself, I'll wager.

219
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,233
So shoot me.

220
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,556
Forgive me for prying,
but I get the feeling...

221
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,791
there was little or no risk
in this particular investment.

222
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,711
No risk whatsoever.

223
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,158
So, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
I do have a meeting.

224
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,710
Wait. I mean, why don't we go again?

225
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,719
Again?

226
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,877
Tony, Mr. Hamilton
has been more than generous.

227
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,279
Thank you.

228
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,871
- Can I help you?
- Love, is he in?

229
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,790
- Excuse me.
- Good to see you again.

230
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,552
Excuse me, gentlemen. How are you?

231
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,155
Mr. Hamilton.
I want to shake you by the hand.

232
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,751
You are a very great man,
and I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

233
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,518
When I gave you that money, I did,
for one second, consider the possibility...

234
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,910
that you could have been, you know...
I can't even say it.

235
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,230
Go ahead. Please. Get it off your chest.

236
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,754
I thought you could have been
one of those conmen.

237
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,070
I might never see my money or him
ever again.

238
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,196
Unbelievable. I need a drink.
Scotch, please, darling.

239
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,349
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
This is Mr. Redford, a client of mine.

240
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,479
Mr. Redford, this is Tony Monroe
and Peter Williams.

241
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,232
Peter, how do you do?

242
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,198
I'm ready to go again,
but this time I wanna go bigger.

243
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,272
Fine. But this is neither the time
nor the place to...

244
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,429
I'm ready.

245
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,308
Perhaps you'd like to show
Tony and Peter out?

246
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,753
No, wait.

247
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,998
If there's another deal up for grabs,
I'd like to hear about it.

248
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,478
- Tony?
- Absolutely, yes.

249
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,436
Thank you. My car will pick you up
tomorrow morning.

250
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,589
Thank you.

251
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,551
I'm no expert,
but I'd say that went like a dream.

252
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,235
- So am I in?
- You're in.

253
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,309
Thank you.

254
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,869
Go.

255
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,438
Just waiting for some new clients...

256
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,988
here to see Mr. Hamilton in 105.

257
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,352
- I'll check the list.
- They might not be on it.

258
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,789
If they're not on the list, I'll need to check.

259
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,517
Isn't 105 Mr. Moss's office?

260
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,988
- Do you believe in love at first sight?
- What?

261
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,749
Don't panic.

262
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,555
Do you know what it's like,
watching you sitting here every day?

263
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,996
I just want an insy-winsy little kiss.
Can I, please?

264
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,638
Mr. Hamilton's expecting you.

265
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,472
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

266
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,229
Got it. They've got a positive ID.

267
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,640
He's a short con artist called Danny Blue.

268
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,989
Any history?

269
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,839
He played a con three months ago,
south of the river.

270
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,592
But the mark withdrew his complaint...

271
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,557
and CPS wouldn't prosecute
without evidence.

272
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,198
Why did he pull out?

273
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,834
The mark bet his life savings
in a horseracing scam...

274
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,990
but his wife didn't know anything about it.

275
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,116
I suppose he wanted to keep it that way.

276
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,589
Hard to explain over breakfast, I guess.

277
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,110
It must be true what they say:
"There's one born every minute."

278
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,240
Gentlemen, come in. Take a seat.

279
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,109
Thank you.

280
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,319
Sorry I'm late, guys.

281
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,958
Ran into an old friend.

282
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,395
Gentlemen, welcome to the land of plenty.

283
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,789
Thank you.

284
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,278
What I'm about to show you
may be foolproof...

285
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,191
but it's also illegal.

286
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,948
There's no victim, but it's against the law.

287
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,951
Would you like me to continue?

288
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,754
You see, the first rule of the con...

289
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,516
...is you can't cheat an honest man.
- It's never been done.

290
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,318
- Can't happen.
- Impossible.

291
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,994
It only works if you want something
for nothing.

292
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,038
- What do we do?
- We give you nothing for something.

293
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,792
You're £1,000 up so far.

294
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,518
It's a very good time to walk away.

295
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,909
- But he can't.
- Because he's so greedy.

296
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,794
- So what do we do?
- Feed the greed.

297
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,830
But he's got one last chance.

298
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,112
We've told him it's illegal.

299
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,078
You could lose everything.

300
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,188
- Career, wife, home.
- Prison.

301
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,238
Get out while you can.

302
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,357
Do the smart thing.

303
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,473
As I was saying,
what I'm about to show you...

304
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,994
may be foolproof, but it's against the law.

305
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,196
Now, would you like me to continue?

306
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,630
Laws were made to be broken.

307
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,477
Can you tell Peterson
I want those breakdowns by lunchtime?

308
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,029
Thank you.

309
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,234
Share transactions
from Tokyo and New York...

310
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,788
are relayed to the city of London
by computer.

311
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,917
Or more precisely, our computer.

312
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,039
When the multi-nationals publish their
annual reports, there's a flurry of activity.

313
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,749
If a company does well, their shares
attract buyers and the price jumps.

314
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,515
We've managed to delay those
transactions in the system long enough...

315
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,275
to assess them and put
our own order in to buy before them.

316
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,715
So you buy, knowing the share prices
are gonna go up?

317
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,950
- Exactly.
- They must notice the delay.

318
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,156
Not when it's less than
nine-tenths of a second.

319
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,832
You can do this in less than a second?

320
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,390
Our mainframe can make three million
calculations in that time.

321
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,318
What's in it for you?

322
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,876
I take 25% Of your profit.

323
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,190
- <i>2</i>5%?
- Non-negotiable.

324
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,272
Hang on. The profit is guaranteed, right?

325
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,035
Set in stone.
If there's no profit, I don't get paid.

326
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,077
In three days, the oil company Vestron
are releasing their annual report.

327
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,069
Once it's out, every major broker
will be crawling all over those shares.

328
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,238
The plan is to buy
£500,000 worth of shares.

329
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,153
I have two investors already in place
at £100,000 each.

330
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,071
There are three places left.

331
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,238
£100, 000?

332
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,398
Great, yeah, I'm in.

333
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,395
I don't know if I can raise
that kind of money...

334
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,359
The boat leaves in three days.
Either you're on it, or you're not. Tony?

335
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,872
It's a lot of money, but I'll find it.

336
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,356
You don't mind if I call my broker?

337
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,715
What I've just said can't leave this room.

338
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,429
I'm not in the habit of investing
in companies I've never heard of.

339
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,676
George? Peter Williams.
What do you know about Vestron?

340
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,118
No problem.
Just heard a whisper, that's all.

341
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,193
No. I'll call you if anything comes of it.

342
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,513
Count me in.

343
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,915
Good. One more thing...

344
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,231
I don't want to leave any paper trails.
The money has to be in cash.

345
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,753
- Cash?
- Problem?

346
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,430
- I suppose not.
- Good.

347
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,908
I just want to thank you
for this opportunity.

348
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,638
- Likewise.
- Thank you.

349
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,229
Work the spell.

350
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,913
How're you doing?

351
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,033
Save us both a little time.
I don't screw people I work with.

352
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,229
No?

353
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,237
Does that go for everyone?

354
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,998
Or just the troops?

355
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,949
Do you want a little tip, Danny?
Some friendly advice?

356
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,156
Yeah, that would be great.

357
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,199
Watch and learn.
Stay out of things that don't concern you.

358
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,791
- Your guys seem pretty tight.
- After a while, you get to be family.

359
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,753
I say something funny?

360
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,515
No. The whole family thing works for me.

361
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,672
You play short cons, Danny.

362
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,548
Emptying people's wage packets on
a Friday night. You wouldn't understand.

363
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,440
- Can I make a criticism?
- Okay.

364
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,272
£100,000?

365
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,234
We can take this guy
for a lot more than that.

366
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,197
That's the bit you don't get.

367
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,552
It's not just about the money.

368
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,437
- Since when?
- Since always.

369
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,074
You don't get that, you don't get anything.

370
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,754
My old man was as straight as they come.

371
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,071
Never wanted much
and life didn't disappoint him.

372
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,710
He worked, ate, slept.

373
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,360
Paid his taxes on time, toed the line.

374
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,635
The only dream he had was retiring at 60.

375
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,191
Dropped dead in the Post Office
three days before his 60th birthday.

376
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,791
He was paying his phone bill.

377
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,955
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Me, too.

378
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,438
You want to be regular people? Do you?

379
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,389
Go do that. They're crying out
for foot soldiers down there.

380
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,799
Go and have your life run by bosses,
bank managers, and politicians.

381
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,428
But if you want to be a grifter...

382
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,028
don't have anything in your life
you can't walk away from in a second.

383
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,473
Lovers, friends, even your own mother.

384
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,793
What about your wife?

385
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,357
I heard what happened.

386
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,915
She wanted me to be something I wasn't.

387
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,068
And I was desperate not to disappoint her.

388
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,872
Recipe for disaster.

389
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,911
If you were still together...

390
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,310
you're telling me you could
just walk away from her?

391
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,512
First rule, Danny:

392
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,831
Always look after number one.

393
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,589
If you don't, no one else will.

394
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,592
I'll try and remember that.

395
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,314
Go home, Danny. Get some sleep.

396
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,353
Danny Blue.

397
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,711
The kid did well today.

398
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,399
Reminds me of you.

399
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,914
Worryingly.

400
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,953
Okay, come on.

401
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,473
How did you find him?

402
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,678
- Am I that transparent?
- You taught me well.

403
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,874
I heard about him. He's good.

404
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,431
Wants to be the best.

405
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,592
That sound familiar?

406
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,760
I told Eddie to point him in your direction.

407
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,876
I'm all but done anyway.

408
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,712
- You going to miss it?
- We're all trying to get out.

409
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,951
You would, too, if you could
think of something else to do.

410
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,199
All right, boys.

411
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,155
You know what I love about roulette?

412
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,919
That glorious 30 seconds
while the wheel is still spinning.

413
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,913
<i>Christopher Rawlings.</i>

414
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,957
The horseracing scam.

415
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,159
His wife found out
he'd lost their life savings.

416
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,190
He's ready to press charges.

417
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,076
You ever been to prison, Danny?

418
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,714
- Shouldn't you be taping this?
- That's Plan B.

419
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,190
- Want to hear Plan A?
- Surprise me.

420
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,989
We've already got enough to send
everyone down. No way around that.

421
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,753
But bearing in mind who the mark is,
the powers that be...

422
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,558
would rather not have a lengthy trial.

423
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,598
They think the details
might be embarrassing.

424
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,630
What they need is a watertight case
so overwhelming, everyone pleads guilty.

425
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,993
We'll rush the sentencing through
and the whole thing blows over.

426
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,197
Sounds like you've got it all worked out.

427
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,474
We have.

428
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,514
We know you came into the game late.
So you get a lifeline.

429
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,753
- Which is?
- Just do what you've been doing.

430
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,356
After the arrests, we take you
to a safe house, you make a statement.

431
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,635
Once the team knows
we've got your evidence...

432
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,678
they'll know they can't do anything
but plead guilty.

433
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,638
In return, you walk away into the sunset.

434
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,632
What if I don't?

435
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,109
Like I said, you go down
with the rest of them...

436
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,192
and we'll add the Rawlings job
for good measure.

437
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,558
All you have to do is go back,
pretend we never had this conversation.

438
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,633
Mickey and the others are
going to prison whatever you do.

439
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,157
The only choice you have to make
is whether you go with them or not.

440
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,639
Be smart, Danny.

441
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,352
Look after number one.

442
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,279
- Where's the kid?
- He'll be here.

443
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,951
Opening night nerves.

444
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,112
Williams is on his way up.

445
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,795
Gentlemen.

446
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,475
You're late.

447
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,756
- I'm sorry...
- Doesn't matter. There's no time.

448
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,319
Let's get this done.

449
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,835
- Where's Redford?
- He'll be here.

450
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,195
I thought we were all
going to do this together.

451
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,272
If there's a problem,
we can call the whole thing off.

452
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,993
Here he is.

453
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,199
Look, Mickey...

454
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,188
Armed police!
Everybody stay exactly where you are!

455
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,793
Put the case down!

456
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,311
Everyone, hands on heads.

457
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,674
What the hell is going on?

458
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,035
You've been caught up
in a confidence trick, sir.

459
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,588
These men are planning
to swindle you out of your money.

460
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,557
There must be some mistake.

461
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,910
All right, Danny. You can go.

462
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,589
Judas.

463
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,075
Listen, this is not how it looks.

464
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,309
Get the cases.

465
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,073
Don't do it, Michael.

466
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,958
Final lesson, Danny.

467
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,234
I mean it.

468
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,671
- Oh, God!
- Get him out of here.

469
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,268
Bastard!

470
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,272
- We need a statement.
- I have my position to think of.

471
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,477
- We understand that, sir.
- Just give me my money and I'll go.

472
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,951
- We can't do that, it's evidence.
- Sod the money. Let me out of here.

473
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,793
I can't be implicated in something
like this. It'll ruin me.

474
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,678
If we have enough evidence,
we can get guilty pleas.

475
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,399
- It won't go to court.
- Am I under arrest?

476
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,313
- We need your statement.
- Am I under arrest?

477
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,954
No, sir.

478
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,472
Get out of my way.

479
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,153
Let him go.

480
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,430
Let's hope the boss can do his stuff.

481
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,713
Sorry about the head.

482
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,709
- You killed him.
- I saved your life, Danny.

483
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,719
Everyone's in custody.

484
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,189
We'll get you checked out
on the way to the station.

485
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,352
First, time to keep your end of the bargain.

486
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,954
Be sure not to miss anything out.

487
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,918
I'm not a grass.

488
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,473
Be smart, Danny.

489
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,548
All you can do now is lose.

490
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,273
Then I lose.

491
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,752
I'd sooner that than hook up
with a murdering scumbag like you.

492
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,355
- Stone fired a gun at you.
- He thought I'd betrayed him.

493
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,792
You do this, or I'll see you get five years.

494
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,353
Last chance.

495
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,919
Go screw yourself.

496
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,950
Okay, he's all yours.

497
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,596
I knew you'd be okay, kid.

498
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,029
- I don't get it.
- You're all right.

499
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,999
Congratulations.

500
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,674
<i>Sarge, the prisoners you asked for</i>
<i>are gone.</i>

501
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,716
What do you mean, they've gone?

502
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,679
Who signed them out?

503
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,714
<i>It says here D.I. DePalma.</i>

504
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,593
Don't do it, Michael.

505
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,638
Final lesson, Danny.

506
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,514
I mean it.

507
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,278
I got something for you.

508
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,920
If you don't know,
find me someone who does.

509
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,275
I wanna know
who sent DePalma over here.

510
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,318
Who gave him his orders,
who his superior officer is.

511
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,192
No, you will not phone me back.
I wanna speak to someone there now.

512
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,116
Danny Blue. Neil Cooper.

513
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,792
This man defines the term "con artist."

514
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,793
I'm just passing through. Glad I could help.

515
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,634
Hang on a minute. You shot at me.

516
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,915
Yeah, but I missed, remember?

517
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,910
You're telling me we're home free?

518
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,072
<i>Absolutely. Unless the police</i>
<i>would like to go to court...</i>

519
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,277
<i>and explain how the investigation</i>
<i>was led by one of the accused.</i>

520
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,631
It's all in the detail, kid.

521
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,719
A toast.

522
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,030
To Mickey Bricks' last score.

523
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,638
The end of an era.

524
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,870
The sweetest con of all
is to con another grifter.

525
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,669
One who should know better.

526
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,990
You mean you're not retiring?

527
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,759
I had to say something
to get you all together.

528
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,115
You little devil.

529
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,553
That's brilliant.

530
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,271
It's not all about the money, is it, Mickey?

531
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,237
Here endeth the first lesson.

532
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,309
English
