1
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:48,507
"Notwithstanding the provisions
of subsection 3, section A,

2
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:53,305
clause 214 of the Administrative
Procedures Scotland Act 1978,

3
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:58,710
insofaras the implementation of
the statutory provisions is concerned,

4
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:02,390
the resolution of anomalies
as between departments

5
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:06,309
shall fall within the purview of
the MinisterforAdministrative Affairs".

6
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:07,749
What does it mean?

7
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,515
- I'm sorry?
- What does it mean?

8
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:12,347
Oh, er, well, Minister,

9
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:15,985
it means "notwithstanding
the provisions of..."

10
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,828
I've just read it to you.
What does it mean?

11
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,225
What it says, Minister.
May I remind you,

12
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:24,387
you are seeing a deputation
from the TUC in 15 minutes,

13
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:27,832
from the CBI afterthat,
and from the NEB at 12 noon.

14
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:31,431
- What do they all want?
- They're all worried about machinery.

15
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:34,109
Yes, for inflation,
deflation and reflation.

16
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:35,628
What do they think I am,

17
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,514
a Ministerof the Crown
ora bicycle pump?

18
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,469
When am I going to do
all this correspondence?

19
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,547
You do realise
you don't actually have to.

20
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:47,832
- Don't I?
- We can draft an official reply.

21
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:49,355
What's that?

22
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:51,631
"The Ministerthanks you
forthe letter".

23
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:55,071
Then we say:
"The matter is underconsideration".

24
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:57,908
Oreven,
"underactive consideration".

25
00:01:58,515 --> 00:01:59,948
What's the difference?

26
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:03,152
"Underconsideration"
means we've lost the file,

27
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:06,944
"Underactive consideration"
means we're trying to find it.

28
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:11,469
You just transferall the letters
to yourOut Tray,

29
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:13,944
put a note if you wish
to see the reply

30
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:16,834
and if you don't,
you neversee it again.

31
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:21,552
If I transfereverything from here
to here, without even reading it,

32
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:23,706
- that's all I have to do?
- Yes.

33
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,388
- Itwill be dealtwith?
- Precisely.

34
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:27,147
- Properly?
- Immaculately.

35
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,271
What's the Minister
here forthen?

36
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:33,350
Er... to make policy decisions,
Minister.

37
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:36,075
When you've decided the policy,
we can carry it out.

38
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:38,032
How often are
policy decisions needed?

39
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,154
From time to time.

40
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:42,465
Bernard, this government
is here to govern.

41
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:45,024
Not merely preside
like ourpredecessors did.

42
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,468
When a country is going
downhill, it's time forsomeone

43
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:53,072
to get into the driving seat,
put his foot on the accelerator.

44
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:54,913
I think you mean the brake.

45
00:02:57,755 --> 00:03:01,430
- Ah, Humphrey.
- A moment of yourtime, Minister.

46
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:06,745
"The official visit to the UK
of the President of Buranda".

47
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:08,143
Where's Buranda?

48
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:10,306
- Africa.
- I've neverheard of it.

49
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:12,830
Yes, it's fairly new, Minister.

50
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,828
It used to be called
British Equatorial Africa.

51
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:20,994
It's the red bit on the left hand
side, below the Mediterranean.

52
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:24,473
Oh, there!
But why's this come to us?

53
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:29,106
- This is forthe Foreign Office.
- There are administrative problems.

54
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,311
Her Majesty's due
to be up at Balmoral,

55
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:33,227
so she'll have
to come to London.

56
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:36,387
State visits are arranged
years in advance.

57
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:39,865
This isn't a state visit,
it's a Head of Government visit.

58
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:42,230
The President of Buranda
is Head of State.

59
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:44,625
But he's also
Head of Government.

60
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:47,025
But ifhe's coming
as Head of Government,

61
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,072
why does the Queen
have to see him?

62
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:52,113
Because she's
the Head of State, Minister.

63
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,710
The Head of State
must greet a Head of State,

64
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,627
even ifhe's not here
as Head of State.

65
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:59,104
It's all a matterofhats.

66
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:00,914
- Hats?
- Yes.

67
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,305
He's coming wearing
his Head of Government hat.

68
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:04,908
He is the Head of State,

69
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,543
but he's notwearing
his Head of State hat,

70
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:11,754
but even though he's wearing
his Head of Government hat,

71
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:14,383
he must still be met by the Crown.

72
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:17,946
Why are we having
an official visit from

73
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:19,867
this tin pot little African country?

74
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:25,155
I beg of you not to referto it
as a tin pot little African country.

75
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:27,346
- It's an L. D. C.
- What?

76
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:30,109
Buranda is
an Under- developed Country.

77
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:33,267
However, this term
was regarded as offensive...

78
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:35,505
so they became known
as Developing Countries

79
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,588
and then as Less Developed
Countries or L. D. C.'s.

80
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,823
We are nowready to replace
the term L. D. C. With H. R. R. C.

81
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:45,030
What's that?

82
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:48,426
- Human Resource Rich Countries.
- Which means?

83
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:51,587
They're grossly overpopulated
and begging formoney.

84
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:55,027
And Buranda is an H. R. R. C?

85
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:56,674
No, Minister.

86
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,708
Is it one
of the "have not" nations?

87
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,433
We don't use that term
any longer.

88
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:04,792
But if we did, Buranda would be
a "will have" nation.

89
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:08,709
Will have a huge amount of oil
in a couple of years from now.

90
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,433
Oh, I see.

91
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:12,506
Why didn't you say so at first?

92
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:17,191
- It's not a T. P. L. A. C. At all.
- T. P. L. A. C?

93
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,994
Tin Pot Little African Country.

94
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:22,064
No, Minister.

95
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:25,034
Oil.
I've got a marvellous idea.

96
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,584
The Queen doesn't have
to come down from Balmoral.

97
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:30,144
Are you proposing
that they should exchange

98
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,112
official greetings
overthe telephone?

99
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,344
No. No. No. No.

100
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,790
You'd like them
to shout rather loudly?

101
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:38,708
No. The visit shall take place
in Scotland.

102
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,309
- At Holyrood Palace.
- Out of the question.

103
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,227
- Why?
- It's not ourdecision.

104
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:46,193
- It's a Foreign Office matter.
- I don't think so.

105
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:49,950
"Notwithstanding the provisions
of subsection 3 blah blah...

106
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,628
it is proposed blah...

107
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:55,754
the resolution of anomalies
shall fall within the purview

108
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:58,634
of the Minister
forAdministrative Affairs.

109
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,063
It's brilliant.

110
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,226
We save the Queen
a pointless journey,

111
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,070
and there are three Scottish
by-elecctions coming up soon.

112
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,066
We'll hold them afterthe visit.

113
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,305
We do not hold
Head of Government visits

114
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:13,228
forparty political reasons,
but forreasons of State.

115
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:16,546
My plan shows that Scotland
is an equal partner in the UK.

116
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:18,068
She is Queen of Scotland too.

117
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:21,386
And it is full of marginal constit...
depressed areas.

118
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,593
I hardly think thatwe can exploit
ourSovereign

119
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:27,315
by involving her
in what some might call

120
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,591
a squalid vote grubbing exercise.

121
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,985
- You want a betterreason, right?
- Indeed we do.

122
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:33,747
Then tell me why he's coming.

123
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:37,108
Forexchange of views
on matters of mutual interest.

124
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:41,063
- Now tell me why he's coming.
- Off shore drilling equipment.

125
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:45,024
We're hoping he's going to place
a huge orderwith us.

126
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:48,513
And where is he going to see
all this offshore equipment?

127
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,188
Aberdeen. Clydeside.

128
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:53,267
Howmany oil rigs
have you got in Haslemere?

129
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:57,150
- But the administrative problems
- That's why we are here.

130
00:06:57,315 --> 00:07:00,830
- But Scotland's so remote...
- Not all that remote.

131
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:04,863
It's that pink bit about
two feet above Potter's Bar.

132
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:06,988
Very droll, Minister.

133
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:08,827
So, it's going to be Scotland.

134
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,553
That is my policy decision.

135
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,626
That's what I'm here for,
right Bernard?

136
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:14,672
Right Humphrey?
Good, thank you.

137
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:25,426
What's he got against the idea?

138
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:27,904
Sir Humphrey likes going
to Foreign Embassies,

139
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:29,827
with his white tie, tails, medals.

140
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,589
Itwill all be on a much smaller
scale in Scotland.

141
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,074
No room for Humphrey?

142
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,669
Onlyforthe Permanent
Secretary there.

143
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,465
Has Sir Humphrey got lots of um...?

144
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:41,833
Yes one ortwo, Minister.

145
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,555
And he's been recommended
forthe K. B. E.

146
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,989
How do you know?

147
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:49,147
I thought honours were
a closely guarded secret.

148
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:59,312
- More coffee, Jumbo?
- Thank you, Humpy.

149
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:04,910
Any luck with the Foreign Secretary
about this Scottish nonsense?

150
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:08,112
"Fraid not. Can't budge him.
Your Ministernobbled him first.

151
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,913
No chance of getting it
back to London?

152
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:12,873
No, I'm afraid the Cabinet
are utterly united.

153
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,469
All these marginal seats,
d'you see?

154
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:16,675
Shameful.

155
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:18,314
- Political.
- Typical.

156
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,703
Inevitable.

157
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:22,187
And so blatant.

158
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:25,791
Issuing writs forthree Scottish
by-elections to poll

159
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:27,946
on the day afterthe visit.

160
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:33,184
Can you imagine Harold MacMillan
doing a thing like that?

161
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,029
Yes.

162
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:38,506
Yes, so can I, actually.

163
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:42,875
Now, about the arrangements
forScotland.

164
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:46,391
The reception I mean.
Do we knowwho's going?

165
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:49,513
Yes. I'm afraid the Burandan
Consulate in Edinburgh

166
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:50,994
is rathera hutch.

167
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:54,591
I shall have to carry the flag
forthe Civil Service all by myself.

168
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,144
Oh really?

169
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,910
Well, you have my sympathy.

170
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:03,194
God knows what they'll be serving up
forthe Scots and Burandans.

171
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:06,347
Haggis in missionary sauce,
I shouldn'twonder.

172
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:11,711
Actually, between ourselves,
the visitwill probably neverhappen.

173
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,231
- Neverhappen? Why?
- Rumblings in the interior.

174
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:18,193
Oh dear...
Oh, I see what you mean.

175
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:21,752
- From ourman in Mungoville.
- Isn't that ratherserious?

176
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:24,987
Buranda's a friendly country
with a Commonwealth connection.

177
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:28,192
Our information is it's likely
to turn into a hostile L. D. C.

178
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:30,232
With a Cuban connection.

179
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:33,587
- Whatwill the Government do?
- The same as always...

180
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,393
Damn all!

181
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:49,753
We are just getting reports
of a coup d'etat in Buranda,

182
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:53,544
the West African State, formerly
British Equatorial Africa.

183
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:55,910
It is reported that
the Commander in Chief

184
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,908
Colonel Selim Mohammed
has been declared President.

185
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:02,227
It is not known what's happened
to President Alam,

186
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:05,944
who was due to pay an official visit
to Britain next week.

187
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,749
There is still no sign
of agreement...

188
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:12,228
Did you see that?
Get me the Foreign Secretary.

189
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,754
Shall we scramble?

190
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,554
No, it's not secret,
it's on the news.

191
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:25,423
Martin.

192
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:28,905
- What's all this about Buranda?
- What's all what?

193
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,713
There's been a coup d'etat.

194
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:31,915
How do you know?

195
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:34,111
Itwas on the news.
Didn't you see?

196
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,266
You're Foreign Secretary!

197
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,232
My TV set's on the blink.

198
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:43,352
YourTV set?
Don't you get telegrams?

199
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:47,548
No, they come in later.
I get all the foreign news from TV.

200
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:51,146
You're joking... aren't you?

201
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:52,464
No.

202
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:55,786
We've got to make sure
this official visit still happens.

203
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,185
How can we?
Who's the new President?

204
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,949
We must find out.
And make sure he comes.

205
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:03,834
- There are three by-elections.
- I know that.

206
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,269
Let me know if you hear...

207
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:08,552
No, you let me know.
You're the one with the telly.

208
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:15,312
- You've heard the sad news?
- Yes, disaster.

209
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,831
No. No. No.
No, just a slight inconvenience.

210
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:22,509
The wheels are in motion,
it's really simple

211
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:24,950
to cancel the arrangements
forthe visit.

212
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:28,073
- You'll do no such thing.
- We have no choice.

213
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:31,750
We are reissuing the invitation
forthe new President.

214
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,710
But, we haven't recognised
his government.

215
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,747
The wheels are in motion.

216
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:40,349
- But who is he?
- Mohammed something.

217
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:42,824
We knownothing about him.
What's he like?

218
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,271
We're not putting him up
forthe Athenaeum.

219
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:47,504
Minister.

220
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,393
Buranda is in total confusion.

221
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,227
We don't know
who is behind him.

222
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:52,874
Whetherhe's Soviet backed,

223
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:55,947
orjust a Burandan with an eye
forthe main chance.

224
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,231
We cannot take diplomatic risks.

225
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:00,750
- The Government has no choice.
- But Her Majesty...

226
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:03,634
Her Majesty will cope.
She always does.

227
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:05,948
But who is he?

228
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:09,588
He might not be
properly brought up.

229
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,625
He might be rude to her.

230
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,945
He might take liberties.

231
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:19,589
He will be photographed
with Her Majesty

232
00:12:19,755 --> 00:12:23,145
and what ifhe turns out
to be anotherldi Amin.

233
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,435
The repercussions are
too hideous to contemplate.

234
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:28,711
- We'll find out about him.
- We can't.

235
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,343
All thatwe know
is that he's an enigma.

236
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:33,905
Humphrey,
I don't care forthatword.

237
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:36,354
Enigma?

238
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:40,391
And there are reasons of State
which make this visit essential.

239
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,352
Buranda is enormously rich.

240
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:46,224
It needs oil rigs and we have
idle shipyards on the Clyde.

241
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:49,353
Buranda is essential
to ourAfrican policy.

242
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,790
The Government doesn't have
African policy.

243
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:53,628
Well, it has now.

244
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:55,866
And ifhe is Marxist backed,

245
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:58,947
who betterto win him over
to ourside than her Majesty?

246
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:03,393
Moreover, it is an important
state occasion forScotland.

247
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,671
Not to mention
three marginal by-elections.

248
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:08,588
Not to mention...
It has nothing to do with it!

249
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,552
Of course not.

250
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,625
Yes?
It's the Foreign Secretary.

251
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:18,272
Martin? Yes? Yes?

252
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:20,388
The visit's on.

253
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:22,273
Oh, splendid.

254
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:26,224
The new President
of Buranda intends

255
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:29,353
to visit this country,
as previously agreed.

256
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:32,234
So, the Foreign Office
is getting the facts at last?

257
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,589
Well, not exactly.

258
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:36,508
Martin's driverheard
a newsflash on his carradio.

259
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:38,908
So, the visit's on.

260
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:41,430
That is my recommendation
to the PM.

261
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:44,509
Anotherpolicy decision,
Bernard.

262
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:47,553
Quite a lot of them afterall,
aren't they?

263
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:14,104
Burandan Airways!
They are doing well.

264
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:17,349
- Howmany planes do they have?
- None.

265
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,747
What about that one?

266
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:24,306
That one was chartered lastweek
and repainted specially.

267
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,833
Actually, there's one 747
that belonged to

268
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:32,431
9 different African airlines
in one month.

269
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,224
They called it the Mumbo Jumbo.

270
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,273
- When does my plane leave?
- I've booked you on the sleeper.

271
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,744
- You'll be at the House tonight.
- Oh, lord.

272
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,224
And nowwe are about to catch
ourfirst glimpse

273
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:49,114
of President Selim Mohammed
of Buranda.

274
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:52,147
I knowhim!
That's Charlie.

275
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:55,907
- Charlie?
- We were at L. S. E. Together.

276
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:58,669
He's not Selim Mohammed,
he's Charles Umtali.

277
00:14:58,835 --> 00:14:59,904
Are you sure?

278
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:03,192
You don't forget a name
like Charlie Umtali.

279
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:06,028
- Have we anything on this?
- In the brief it stated

280
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:09,471
that Colonel Selim Mohammed
was converted to Islam.

281
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:12,866
We didn't knowhis previous name
norhis background.

282
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:15,549
He's a red hot
political economist.

283
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,785
Wiped the floorwith everyone.

284
00:15:17,955 --> 00:15:19,547
- That's all right then.
- Why?

285
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:24,072
He'll knowhow to behave
ifhe went to an English University.

286
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:26,465
Even if itwas the L. S. E.

287
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:29,475
You said red hot,
were you speaking politically?

288
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:32,354
Partly.
You neverknowwith Charlie.

289
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:36,667
He follows you into a revolving
doorand comes out first.

290
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:38,988
No deep commitment?

291
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:42,670
- Only to Charlie.
- I see. A politician, Minister.

292
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,112
Very droll, Humphrey.

293
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:48,034
It'll be a couple of days.
Can't do much harm.

294
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:52,632
Always remember, Minister,
you wanted him here, not me.

295
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,150
It is afterhalf past, Minister.

296
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:58,510
When am I going to do
all this correspondence?

297
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:00,745
Well, Minister...

298
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:17,753
Well done, Minister.
Betterout than in.

299
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:22,672
22:30 Edinburgh train

300
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:25,668
will leave from Platform 7...

301
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,187
- Who is it?
- Bernard.

302
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,823
Come in.
Bernard, what's the matter?

303
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,555
- Will you read this, please?
- No, I will not.

304
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,706
- It's top priority...
- You always say that.

305
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,265
It is a copy of President Selim's
speech tomorrow.

306
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:11,107
I know these speeches:

307
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:14,713
Happy to be here,
bonds of shared experience,

308
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,390
- Ties between ourtwo countries.
- That is all in it, but...

309
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:21,149
- I'm not going to read it tonight.
- I think you should.

310
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:23,875
I've underlined
the important bits in red ink.

311
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:26,868
I'll just distribute some copies
around the train.

312
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:28,150
Around the train?

313
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:31,307
To Sir Humphrey, the Foreign
Secretary, the Press Officer...

314
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,993
"Burandans feel

315
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,794
a special affinity with the

316
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,306
Celtic peoples

317
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:49,830
in theirstruggle forfreedom.

318
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,066
We too had to fight
to break free

319
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:56,068
from the chains
of British colonialism".

320
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:59,386
Bristish colonialism?

321
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:04,148
"The people of Buranda
urge the Scots and the Irish

322
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:10,630
to end the English oppression,
cast off the imperialist yoke

323
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:13,707
and join the fellowship
of free nations".

324
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:15,794
Good God!

325
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:17,663
Yes.

326
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:21,465
We would appearto have been
caughtwith ourtrousers down.

327
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:24,071
He can't say this in front ofher.

328
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:26,510
I don't like to say I told you so.

329
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:30,714
- Egg all overourfaces.
- Not egg, just imperialist "yoke".

330
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,551
Three Scottish by-elections.

331
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:36,707
It is indeed a catastrophe.
A tragedy.

332
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,504
A cataclysmic, apocolyptic,
monumental calamity.

333
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:44,065
- And you did it.
- You're paid to advise me, advise me!

334
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:47,068
This is like trying to advise
the Captain of the Titanic

335
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:49,510
afterhe's struck the iceberg.

336
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:51,472
There must be
something we can do.

337
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:54,308
We could sing Abide with Me?

338
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:56,389
- Yes?
- Minister.

339
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:58,750
The Foreign Secretary
would like a word.

340
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:01,344
- Ah, Foreign Secretary.
- Have you read this...?

341
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,665
My Minister is concerned
thatwe will have egg

342
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,986
all overourface.
Scotch egg, presumably.

343
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,233
- Why is he doing it?
- Maybe it's forhome consumption.

344
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:13,387
Perhaps he's trying to persuade
the otherAfrican Leaders

345
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:15,989
that he's a pukka anticolonialist.

346
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,624
Yes? Yes, Bernard?

347
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:21,025
The Press Officer
would like a word.

348
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,469
Oh dear!

349
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:24,188
Room fora little 'un?

350
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,346
Do you think it's good idea
to issue a statement?

351
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:29,313
Well, Minister, in practical terms

352
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:31,711
we have the usual six options.

353
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:34,594
One, do nothing.

354
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:37,394
Two, issue a statement
deploring the speech.

355
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:39,944
Three, lodge an official protest.

356
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:41,184
Four, cut off aid.

357
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:43,915
Five, break off diplomatic relations.

358
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:46,509
- And six, declare war.
- Which should we do?

359
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:49,473
If we do nothing,
we implicity agree with the speech.

360
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:53,753
Two, if we issue a statement,
we just look foolish.

361
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:56,554
Three, if we lodge a protest,
itwill be ignored.

362
00:19:56,715 --> 00:20:00,071
Four, we can't cut off aid
because we don't give them any.

363
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:02,874
Five, if we break off
diplomatic relations

364
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,344
we can't negotiate
the oil rig contracts.

365
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:10,145
And six, if we declare war it might
just look as if we were overreacting.

366
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,748
In the old days
we'd just send in a gun boat.

367
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:18,192
I suppose that is absolutely
out of the question?

368
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:21,709
- Yes?
- Minister...

369
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,867
The Permanent UnderSecretary
of the Foreign Office.

370
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:26,946
It'll be like
the Black Hole of Calcutta.

371
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,714
- May I come in, Minister.
- You can try.

372
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,951
This is all we needed.

373
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,544
Welcome
to the Standing Committee.

374
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:39,551
Sir Frederick, what are we going
to do about this?

375
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:41,831
Well, Minister,
Foreign Secretary...

376
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,223
I think...

377
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:48,711
I think we knowwhat's behind it,

378
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,547
don'twe, Humpy?

379
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:52,234
Humpy?

380
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:58,148
Sir Frederick is suggesting that
the offending paragraph may be

381
00:20:58,315 --> 00:21:00,146
a bargaining counter.

382
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:03,387
- He wants something?
- Why send us an advance copy?

383
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,989
Why don't you find out
what it is he wants?

384
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:09,192
The Embassy staff are all new,
we've just seen the speech.

385
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:11,744
And no one knows anything
about this President.

386
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:13,064
Except me.

387
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:16,910
- Except you?
- They were at University together.

388
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,829
- The old boy network.
- Thatwas 25 years ago.

389
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:24,590
He may not even rememberme...
I don't really think I could...

390
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,313
You ought to see him.

391
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:29,228
I think you carry more weight.

392
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:34,268
Then the mountain
shall go to Mohammed?

393
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,312
No. No. No. Jim's going.

394
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:38,346
That's what I meant.

395
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:41,595
All right.
But you'll have to come with me.

396
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,347
Of course, Minister.

397
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:46,427
I'd hardly let you do it
on yourown.

398
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:53,907
Jim, come in.

399
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:57,870
- Hownice to see you again.
- Charlie... Long time no see.

400
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:01,186
You don't have to speak
pidgin English to me.

401
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:05,384
Sir Humphrey Appleby,
my Permanent UnderSecretary.

402
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:08,023
- Your Excellency.
- How do you do.

403
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:09,874
Do sit down.

404
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:15,308
Permanent UnderSecretary
is such a demeaning title.

405
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:17,993
I beg yourpardon?

406
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:20,914
Sounds like an Assistant Typist
orsomething,

407
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:25,071
whereas you're really
in charge of everything.

408
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:27,790
Well, not quite everything.

409
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:30,947
I should congratulate you
on becoming Head of State.

410
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:33,265
Oh, thanks.
Itwasn't difficult.

411
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,825
I didn't do boring things,
like fighting elections

412
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:39,752
orby-elections.

413
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:43,023
Jim, of course I'm delighted
to see you,

414
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,629
but is this purely a social visit,

415
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:48,355
or is there anything
you wanted to talk about?

416
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:51,348
I do have to finish my speech.

417
00:22:51,515 --> 00:22:55,303
Ah... Well, yes... Actually,
we have seen an advanced copy...

418
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,794
You liked it?

419
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,752
Charlie, may I speak frankly?

420
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:02,985
- We're old friends.
- Of course.

421
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:06,625
You must realise that that bit
about colonialist oppression

422
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:09,707
was a bit...
well... um, very...

423
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:13,793
Well, actually
profoundly embarrassing.

424
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:18,547
That passage where you urged
the Scots and the Irish to er...

425
00:23:20,955 --> 00:23:24,391
I wonder if you could um,
give it a miss?

426
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,111
- Give it a miss?
- Yes.

427
00:23:27,395 --> 00:23:31,183
But, this is something I feel very,
very deeply to be true.

428
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:34,074
Surely the British don't believe
in suppressing the truth?

429
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:36,146
Good heavens no.

430
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:39,464
I wonder if there's anything
that might persuade you

431
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:43,230
to considerrecasting that sentence
and transfering the emphasis

432
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:46,467
from the specific instance
to the abstract concept

433
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:47,909
without in any way,

434
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:51,829
impairing the conceptual
integrity of the theme.

435
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:56,634
Yes...

436
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:59,713
May I change the subject?

437
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:04,153
Jim, while you're here may I sound
you out on a proposal

438
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:06,670
I was going to make
to the Prime Minister?

439
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:07,835
What proposal?

440
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:11,829
Our little change of Government
has quite unnecessarily alarmed

441
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:14,429
some of the investors
in ouroil industry.

442
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:17,393
Only temporarily,
but it does mean thatwe need

443
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:20,592
a little British investment
to tide us over.

444
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:23,667
To restore confidence, you know.

445
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:24,950
Howmuch?

446
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:27,185
Fifty million pounds.

447
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:30,746
Ask him on what terms.

448
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:34,272
On what terms?

449
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:36,824
Repayment of the capital
not to start before ten years.

450
00:24:36,995 --> 00:24:38,826
And interest free.

451
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:46,551
Fifty million pounds...
it's a lot ot money.

452
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,593
I see, well in that case...

453
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:52,191
But that doesn't mean
we can't talk about it?

454
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:57,189
Interest free?
Ten years?

455
00:24:57,355 --> 00:24:59,664
Assuming a 10 % interest,

456
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:03,271
he's asking fora free gift
of fifty million pounds.

457
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,154
Itwould appear
that you're asking for

458
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:09,193
a free gift
of about fifty million pounds.

459
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:10,993
But it's to youradvantage.

460
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:14,830
We would use the loan
to buy oil rigs built on the Clyde.

461
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:16,553
Ah, well.

462
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,783
He's asking us to give him
50 million pounds

463
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:23,584
so that he can buy
ouroil rigs with ourmoney.

464
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:27,785
Reasonable to me.

465
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:33,030
- Reasonable, Minister?
- Lots of jobs, Humphrey.

466
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:36,312
Supposing itwere possible
to do this deal,

467
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:41,424
would you find it possible
to make cuts in yourspeech?

468
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:46,712
Yes, but I'd have to knownow.

469
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:50,229
Blackmail!

470
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:52,955
Are you describing me,
ormy proposal?

471
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:57,226
Yourproposal, naturally.

472
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:00,830
No, no, not even yourproposal.

473
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:05,185
I think we can come
to agreement, don't you Humphrey?

474
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:07,554
Minister...

475
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:13,106
Could I have a word with you?

476
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:14,674
Yes?

477
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:21,509
Will you excuse us,
Your Excellency?

478
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:26,673
- Is anything wrong?
- Is anything right?

479
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,109
He's offering us a way out.

480
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:30,835
A gift of 50 million pounds
is a way out?

481
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:33,828
- It's a loan.
- We'll neverget it back.

482
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:36,668
You buy yourway out
of political involvement

483
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:38,951
with fifty million pounds
of public money?

484
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:41,913
- It's diplomacy.
- It's corruption, Minister.

485
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:44,991
K. B. E.

486
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:47,908
Humpy.

487
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,954
You mean...

488
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,828
Yes, I see.

489
00:26:58,995 --> 00:27:03,466
I suppose we don'twant the Soviets
to invest in Buranda, do we?

490
00:27:04,595 --> 00:27:09,908
And I suppose it could be argued
thatwe have a responsibility to the...

491
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:13,229
T. P. L. A. C.'s.

492
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:16,551
Yes, quite.

493
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,384
Oh, good.

494
00:27:19,195 --> 00:27:22,505
Mr. President, I think we can
come to terms afterall.

495
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:26,190
- Well, you knowmy price.
- And you knowmine.

496
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:29,031
Everyone has his price.

497
00:27:31,555 --> 00:27:33,227
Yes, Minister.
