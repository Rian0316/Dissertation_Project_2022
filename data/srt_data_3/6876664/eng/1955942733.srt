1
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:02,257
Previously on The Originals...

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,451
Whoever I am now,

3
00:00:03,476 --> 00:00:04,743
- I want you to marry me.
- Yes.

4
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:05,744
Hayley's missing.

5
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,572
Your family needs you now.

6
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,183
Elijah Mikaelson is dead.

7
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,314
Who is Hayley?

8
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,186
Someone Elijah Mikaelson used to love.

9
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,970
Freya, I couldn’t find him in France.

10
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,189
He’s gone.

11
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:16,632
I figured with everything going on,

12
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:17,800
you could use a friend.

13
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:18,801
I gotta get back to work, Aunt Freya.

14
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:20,498
Or you could tell me about

15
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,955
that cute boy you had hidden
in your room last week.

16
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,940
That stuff you were
studying in those books.

17
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:26,565
My mom’s missing.

18
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:28,289
I can’t just sit around and do nothing.

19
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:29,440
Until Hayley Marshall is found,

20
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:30,856
I am changing the rules.

21
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,381
Break the rules, no more
head garden, just your head.

22
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:36,123
I put the pressure on
to see how the factions react.

23
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,299
The wolves were prepared
to die for their Alpha,

24
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,040
the witches worked with us,

25
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,800
but the vampires...
Did nothing but resist.

26
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:43,347
- What is that?
- A message.

27
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:47,221
From enemies I thought
I buried long, long ago.

28
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:52,356
Rise and shine, Nightwalker Nation.

29
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,445
If it was your aim to get my attention,

30
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,405
then I must say you’ve been
wildly successful.

31
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,278
I am now singularly focused
on your impending suffering.

32
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:06,240
And to whomever sent this coin

33
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:08,198
and took my daughter’s mother...

34
00:01:11,683 --> 00:01:13,641
...it’s time to show your face.

35
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,227
Man, don’t look to me for help.

36
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:40,274
Y’all lost your chance to
trade loyalty for protection.

37
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:43,126
No.

38
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:47,846
This would mark your very last

39
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,805
opportunity to confess.

40
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:51,285
Look, I don’t know anything.

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,174
Well, that’s a pity for you, then.

42
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,420
It’s me you're looking for.

43
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,419
Perhaps we should talk.

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,665
You know, for someone who organized

45
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,232
this little summit,

46
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,786
you’re woefully short on details.

47
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:35,305
So I’m going to ask you one last time.

48
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:43,106
Where are you keeping Hayley?

49
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:58,830
You knew we’d have this little chat.

50
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,745
No doubt you binged on vervain

51
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,921
till your throat was red and raw.

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,361
And now, sadly, drip, drip, drip--

53
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:10,706
All over the floor it goes.

54
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:14,306
"Sein Mangel an Vision...

55
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,954
wird sein Untergang sein."

56
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:22,165
"His lack of vision
will be his downfall."

57
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:24,900
That’s what he always said about you.

58
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:26,911
He?

59
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:28,338
You and I have a friend in common.

60
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:30,906
Oh, I sincerely doubt that.

61
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,943
It’s true.

62
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:36,324
August Müller.

63
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,876
I don’t blame you for forgetting.

64
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,423
It was a long time ago.

65
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,633
Rostock, Germany. Spring...

66
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:48,959
1933.

67
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:00,805
The purpose of art is
to portray life as it is.

68
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,285
When that world is joyous,

69
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,766
art must reflect that beauty, but

70
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:08,465
when our existence is beset
with unrest, humiliation,

71
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:12,252
hyperinflation,
the indignity of reparations,

72
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,951
art must necessarily
be equally drab and ugly.

73
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,170
Or perhaps, August,

74
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:21,217
the ugliness is a result
of the artist lacking

75
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,611
any discernible talent.

76
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:27,314
The mission of art,

77
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,845
is to engage our most
primal selves...

78
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:34,317
to inflame our passion,
to provoke our insight.

79
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:38,187
And it should inspire us
to drink and brawl

80
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,274
and "give our sensual race the rein."

81
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,024
Derivative.

82
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,353
And so...

83
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,271
extraordinarily tedious.

84
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:51,552
I wouldn’t argue with this fool

85
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,530
when he’s not listening
to a single word you say.

86
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,425
He’s simply waiting for you
to draw a breath

87
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,471
so that he might pontificate anew.

88
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:00,735
I believe you’re thinking
of my brother Elijah.

89
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:03,433
He’s the pompous, controlling one.

90
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,739
Interesting. I’d always heard

91
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,543
that Elijah was the
enigmatic and charming one.

92
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,439
The truly distinguished element
of the family.

93
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:15,358
13 years, you don’t look
a day over a thousand.

94
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:17,755
How do you do it, Niklaus?

95
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:21,843
God, I’ve missed you.

96
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:24,454
I fear word of your presence
in Germany has spread.

97
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,805
Rumors of Mikael are
rampant across Europe.

98
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:31,368
Come.

99
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,854
Sit tight, August.

100
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:35,639
I’ll get back to
your hackery momentarily.

101
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,164
Little friend of yours?

102
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,297
Hardly.

103
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,301
Do you remember him now?

104
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:50,785
As an elephant considers
a gnat, merely a trifle.

105
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,787
That trifle

106
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,093
is my Bodhidharma,

107
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,574
my Guru Nanak, my Jesus!

108
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:02,013
August is the touchstone
to everything that I believe,

109
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,319
and the reason

110
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:07,932
that I and my friends

111
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,805
have taken your sweet Hayley.

112
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:18,943
We have a room, you know.

113
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,423
Maybe we should go there.

114
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,487
Yeah, but then we couldn’t make out

115
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,383
in this filthy alley.

116
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:30,817
You were right.

117
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:32,460
About?

118
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,438
The feeling after sundown
without the ring,

119
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:36,638
it’s just...

120
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:39,888
a most transcendent joy.

121
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,881
I’ll take credit for most of that joy,

122
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,100
thank you very much.

123
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:53,475
Behind you, on the corner.

124
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,633
Don’t look. He was in the bar earlier.

125
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,463
You think it’s your family again?

126
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:03,353
I think...

127
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,634
...we ought to introduce ourselves.

128
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,603
Ladies first.

129
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,311
Well, somebody’s been busy.

130
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,101
Busy watching you.

131
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:32,820
Okay,

132
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:34,499
let’s see what you can do.

133
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:40,330
Okay.

134
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:46,149
Pretty cool, huh?

135
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:52,733
What do you think?

136
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,518
I think I wish

137
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,433
I had core muscles like yours.

138
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,130
And that’s nothing compared to what

139
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,785
I’ll be able to do once
I trigger my werewolf side.

140
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:03,696
Yeah.

141
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:04,796
Um...

142
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:07,574
Has your mom ever talked you through

143
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:10,156
- turning?
- A little.

144
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,015
And I-I have friends. I mean,

145
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,554
the whole killing a human part

146
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,148
sounds kind of rough, but...

147
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,541
What about the whole breaking

148
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,977
every bone in your body part?

149
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:24,547
You know, when your mom
talked to me about it,

150
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:28,518
when she, um, really described it,

151
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,770
it sounded worse than almost
anything I could imagine.

152
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,838
And, honestly, it’s...

153
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:38,065
it’s not what she wanted for you.

154
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:39,932
"Wants."

155
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,217
Not what she wants for me.

156
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,338
That’s what I meant.

157
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,159
Your daughter is dangerous.

158
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,487
A menace, a threat.

159
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:54,601
My daughter is a child.

160
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,753
A child born of werewolf blood,

161
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:59,456
who can create hybrids at will.

162
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,323
Her defect must be corrected.

163
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:04,136
Her defect is my defect!

164
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,589
Say that again, I'll
pluck out your eyeballs

165
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,765
and eat them like olives
off my fingertips.

166
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:10,933
I’ll call it what it is.

167
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:12,856
A dirtying of my species.

168
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:16,904
Which diminishes the pure
and superior nature

169
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,166
of vampires.

170
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:19,985
Make your point.

171
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,567
Your daughter will purify herself,

172
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:24,955
submitting to the same spell that

173
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:28,611
your mother, Esther,
once used to bind you.

174
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:32,746
Once her werewolf side is sublimated,

175
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:34,922
Hope will no longer be capable

176
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:37,287
of creating her abominations.

177
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,145
And what if I don’t agree?

178
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:43,250
It’s a simple choice.

179
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:45,846
Your daughter’s werewolf nature

180
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,882
or her mother’s worldly life.

181
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,832
Clock is ticking.

182
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,337
50 werewolves killed in Stäbelow.

183
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:00,817
A further 80 in Wittenberg,

184
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,515
this village just outside of Bentwisch.

185
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:06,803
Entirely wiped out.

186
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,739
A dozen massacres, all within 20
miles of where we sit, Niklaus.

187
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,003
Well, this is too systematic for Mikael.

188
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,217
Besides, I’ve been
keeping a low profile.

189
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,790
Oh, is that what you call this?

190
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:20,551
Yes, Elijah, besotted
fornication is the norm here.

191
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:23,546
The only one who stands out is you.

192
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:24,776
Rebekah.

193
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:25,949
What if that lunatic we call a father

194
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,062
found Rebekah and forced
her to surrender your...

195
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:31,848
Rebekah is ensconced in Chicago
with this Stefan character.

196
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,243
She writes me often
because I’m her favorite.

197
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,960
Yes, I’m afraid to disappoint
you, Niklaus,

198
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,812
but Rebekah writes to absolutely anybody

199
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,423
who will indulge her
about this nauseating affair.

200
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:43,679
She does seem happy.

201
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:46,036
Well, her happiness
is of my highest order.

202
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,640
You should know that.

203
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,056
Hold on a minute.

204
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,664
What is it?

205
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,419
If you don’t mind.

206
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:13,656
Do we have a problem?

207
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:16,937
Yes, I believe we do.

208
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,896
The man was a forgettable artist,

209
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,290
a virulent fascist and a murderous slob

210
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,292
who slaughtered werewolves by the pack.

211
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:26,523
And what did you do to him?

212
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:28,955
What makes you think I
had any piece in this?

213
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:31,125
Oh, I don't know, a couple
hundred years of history.

214
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:36,870
That hideous Greta woman with
her reverence for a dilettante

215
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,828
who made no mark upon the world.

216
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,612
I will not entertain her hateful ask

217
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,092
and bind my child.

218
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:43,136
All right, look,

219
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,168
shouldn’t Hope get a say in this?

220
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:47,750
This fate which she demands,

221
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,162
the curse which I bore for a millennia,

222
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,671
I can't put my daughter through that.

223
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:55,053
It’s a pain worse than death.

224
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:57,760
No, I will see that woman
roast upon a pyre

225
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,695
before I give in to the demands
of these cultists.

226
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,416
Look, all right, I got your back.

227
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,504
I do, okay?

228
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:03,897
But if they kill Hayley,

229
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,542
and Hope isn’t given a chance
to save her,

230
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,162
she will not forgive you.

231
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,730
And if I impose this shame
upon my daughter

232
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,994
and then they kill her mother anyway?

233
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,067
I won’t forgive myself.

234
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:31,402
You should really lock your door.

235
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:32,836
You know that, right?

236
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:34,906
Pretty sure I did, Roman.

237
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:35,812
Okay.

238
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,105
Well, then next time use
a lock I can’t pick.

239
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,868
So what’s the deal with you
and your out

240
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:45,982
She’s my aunt.

241
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:47,984
And why do you care?

242
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,378
Hey, I’m just curious.Hmm.

243
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,498
Hmm?

244
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,849
Why are you so interested in me?

245
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:04,445
- In truth?
- No, lie to me.

246
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:07,851
Okay.

247
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:09,271
A Mikaelson.

248
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:11,007
Daughter of an Original,

249
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:13,466
which is supposed to be impossible.

250
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,684
Dad’s a vampire, Mom’s a werewolf,

251
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:17,241
lineage of witches.

252
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:20,247
I’m interested in you because...

253
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,757
you’re the most interesting.

254
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:24,480
Other than you, of course.

255
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,196
You don’t know anything about me.

256
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,895
Hmm, which is, I’m sure,
exactly how you like it.Maybe.

257
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,155
How about this?

258
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,551
You tell me something about you,

259
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:36,990
and I won’t go to Alaric
with breaking and entering.

260
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:42,885
I once pissed some people off

261
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,433
and ended up desiccated in a cave.

262
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,652
Desiccated?

263
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:49,015
Yeah.

264
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,631
What was that like?

265
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,139
It was... bad.

266
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,928
But then the pain took over and...

267
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,874
I just lost track of everything.

268
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:05,471
Everything but time.

269
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:09,108
How long were you in there?

270
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,038
Long enough to replay the first
pain-free 16 years of my life

271
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:18,522
several times over
before moving on to my 17th.

272
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:24,605
An ancient bad boy vampire
with a damaged soul.

273
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,288
- How positively...
- Literary?

274
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:30,231
Cliché.

275
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:31,392
Oh.

276
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:32,747
Ouch.

277
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,054
Look at you.

278
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:44,579
The vampire supplicant
delivering poison in a bag.

279
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,930
It’s a hangover cocktail
I keep behind the bar.

280
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,063
Electrolytes, five "B" vitamins,

281
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,905
a little glutathione.

282
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,774
Klaus told you to show me pity?

283
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,800
No.

284
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:58,101
My choice.

285
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:00,701
Guess I’m hoping

286
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:03,467
showing you a little kindness
convinces you to let Hayley go.

287
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,992
She’s a good soul, Greta.

288
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:10,335
And none of what happened was her fault.

289
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:13,086
Not directly.

290
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,133
But we had years of peace, Josh.

291
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:20,180
All of which ended because
her loathsome daughter

292
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:22,138
sullied the evolutionary pool.

293
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:25,608
Poppy was a good soul, too, wasn’t she?

294
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,571
Josh.

295
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,201
Have you gone insane?

296
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:43,029
She’s no good to us dead,

297
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,247
and the drip will only help

298
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,988
clear the vervain from her system.

299
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:48,699
And honestly, Marcel, she...

300
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,218
she’s kind of got a point.

301
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,647
Choose your next words very carefully.

302
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,344
Come on, dude.

303
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:56,989
Look, I don’t know exactly what
your new deal is with Klaus,

304
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:58,580
but think about it.

305
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:01,699
Binding Hope means a safe
Hayley, no more hybrids, and...

306
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:04,876
And the Mikaelsons go back
to where they came from, right?

307
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,053
Oh, believe me, I have gamed
this out already.

308
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:10,317
Okay, so, not that I’m in any
position to give advice here,

309
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,582
but maybe, just maybe, you side
with the community on this one.

310
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,065
A question.

311
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:22,284
How do you feel about your skull, Josh?

312
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:24,244
I’m pretty attached to it.

313
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:25,569
Then stop engaging with the enemy

314
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:29,205
and keep your damn opinions to yourself.

315
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,644
You want to talk to me about
the guy with the camera?

316
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,188
He’s come for me before...

317
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:38,606
to watch me.

318
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,608
Stalk me.

319
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,001
Sometimes to bring me back.

320
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:43,949
Bring you back to where?

321
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:45,895
It doesn’t matter.

322
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:48,863
Then why are you packing?

323
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:52,620
Look, all those times that I’ve said

324
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:55,405
that there are things in my past
that I prefer to forget...

325
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,063
...the man with the camera,

326
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:00,106
he’s part of those things.

327
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,195
So, problem solved. He’s dead.

328
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,920
They’ll send a replacement.

329
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:07,635
Who is "they"?

330
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:10,942
Who is "they," Antoinette?

331
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,640
Yes.

332
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,685
I proudly participated

333
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,992
in the thinning of the werewolves.

334
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,777
Decapitated some 90 with my own hands.

335
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,127
"Thinning"?

336
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:23,216
That’s a convenient euphemism.

337
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,088
I’m simply ridding us
of the mongrels who diminish us.

338
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:27,133
Mongrels?

339
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,396
Inferior scourges.

340
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:32,964
Hardly the apex predators
born of Viking stock

341
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,314
like you and I, friend.

342
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:37,317
No, you and I are quite
different, friend.

343
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,406
A fact which I feel I’ll
have to educate you on.

344
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:42,974
I believe what my brother
is trying to say is that you

345
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,977
are a runt.

346
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,850
You are a runt amidst
a species of leviathans.

347
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:51,722
I recommend you not give me
any further reason

348
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:54,725
to stake that feeble,
incurvated sternum of yours.

349
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,989
This is the first and last
warning I will give you.

350
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:07,996
Time to go, Antoinette.

351
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:13,775
Yes, Father.

352
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:38,008
You shouldn’t underestimate
the movement.

353
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:41,032
We will not fail.

354
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,165
You know, history is littered

355
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:46,059
with eugenicists
who overstate their sway.

356
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,519
The Khmer Rouge, the Hutu,
the Turks in Armenia.

357
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:51,136
All of whom

358
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,696
left death and suffering in their wake

359
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,222
and all of whom buckled under
the weight of their own hatred.

360
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,115
Still...

361
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,271
...if you’re feeling confident,

362
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:06,406
tell me the names
of your coconspirators.

363
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:08,786
Sorry.

364
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,810
Tank’s not quite empty yet.

365
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:19,245
You know, August was
very weak and very small.

366
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,247
And yet he spawned a crusade

367
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,249
that lasted a hundred years.

368
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,946
I don’t see a crusade.

369
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:29,733
I see a lone woman grasping to
justify her last gasps of hate.

370
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:34,653
And I see a man who knows that’s a lie.

371
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:38,567
But what you can’t figure out

372
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:40,848
is how many of us there are.

373
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,301
And just how deeply we have
infected your world.

374
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:51,407
I have wanted

375
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:54,236
to tell you more about our past,

376
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:56,859
but I was afraid of how you’d react.

377
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:02,113
I was thinking we could head east.

378
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:05,726
Someone once told me Shanghai
is a safe place to hide out.

379
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,468
Yeah, feel free to send me a postcard.

380
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:11,097
You gave me a ring, Elijah.

381
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:13,159
You asked me to marry you.

382
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:14,580
You spent the last seven years
lying to me.

383
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:15,973
That’s not fair.

384
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:19,208
How could you not tell me that
you and I knew each other?

385
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:20,958
Because we barely met

386
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,612
once or twice in passing.

387
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,373
And the part where my brother
and your father have an entire

388
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:26,486
history together, you neglected
to tell me that, too.

389
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,792
Because I know how this ends.

390
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:31,467
I keep my secrets and
you’ll walk out that door,

391
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:33,325
but that’s still better than...

392
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,881
telling you the truth and
having you hate me forever.

393
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,489
Enjoy Shanghai.

394
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,782
Marcel, I have a question.

395
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,833
Would it be wrong of me to assume
there are traitors in my midst?

396
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:07,169
So...

397
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,921
- What?
- Now we’ve moved from "blameless Klaus"

398
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:12,437
to "paranoid Klaus."

399
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:14,904
Well, if that zealot claims

400
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:17,458
to have friends,
I’ll choose to believe her.

401
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,906
It’s been two days since
you pledged your allegiance,

402
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,193
and your first response
to Greta'’s demands

403
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:23,325
was to question me.

404
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,633
It was to find a way out.

405
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:28,001
It’s gonna take hours to get her clean.

406
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:31,770
And in the meantime,
Hayley sits some damn place.

407
00:21:32,012 --> 00:21:33,746
I’m just looking for a way
to get them to give her back.

408
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,424
I’ll tell you
how they’ll give her back:

409
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,513
breathless, in a wooden box.

410
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:43,723
These people respond to strength,

411
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:45,185
not capitulation.

412
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:47,283
Do you both understand that reality?

413
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:52,876
Can I count on you not to blink
in the face of their hatred?

414
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:56,108
Always.

415
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:02,383
You see that? You see,

416
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:03,820
that is the problem
with our relationship.

417
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,541
I think I’ve signed up
to be his partner,

418
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:09,415
he thinks that I’ve pledged
allegiance to the king.

419
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:11,504
Yeah, well, uh...

420
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,549
Not to risk my skull again, but...

421
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,421
you probably should've told him

422
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,553
you called Freya with Greta'’s demands.

423
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:19,555
There’s nothing to say

424
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,383
until Freya calls back and tells me

425
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:24,091
if Hope intends to bind herself.

426
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,003
It’ll be painful.

427
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,804
- I don’t care.
- You could die.

428
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:29,829
Same answer.

429
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:31,282
We’re talking about snuffing out

430
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,457
a fundamental part of who you are...

431
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,614
Which, as according to you,

432
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:36,529
my mom never wanted me
to trigger anyway.

433
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,444
But which she wanted
to be your decision.

434
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:39,619
And I’m making it.

435
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:40,750
Not like this, Hope.

436
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:42,590
Listen... I know

437
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:45,102
what it’s like to have
something taken from you

438
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,974
against your will. Okay?

439
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,237
For me, it was time.

440
00:22:49,942 --> 00:22:51,457
Years and years, cursed to sleep

441
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,807
by Aunt Dahlia,
while the world spun around me.

442
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,591
And I am telling you: when you realize

443
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,332
everything you’ve missed,

444
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:00,091
it devastates.

445
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:06,560
You know, if it were just to
save my mom, I’d want to do it.

446
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:09,286
Or it could be the fact that...

447
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:12,173
I’m partially responsible
for her being taken.

448
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,522
Or that I’m not even sure

449
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,524
I even want this freakish side
of myself.

450
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,396
But it’s all those things.

451
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:21,097
So, please, Aunt Freya,

452
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,385
get whatever supplies that you need,

453
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,282
because you and I are doing this.

454
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:43,900
The whole "note goes poof in my pocket"?

455
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,815
It’s really kind
of an invasion, you know.

456
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,600
Kind of hypocritical,
coming from the guy

457
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,236
who keeps breaking into my room.

458
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,741
Fair.

459
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:55,379
Um, so...

460
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,957
I need a favor.

461
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:02,270
There’s this thing that
I have to do, and...

462
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:05,628
there’s a chance it might not end well.

463
00:24:06,383 --> 00:24:07,589
A "thing..."

464
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,104
...that "might not end well"?

465
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,644
Does this thing have anything to do

466
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:14,104
with what you and your aunt are...

467
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:17,206
♪ She always takes it black

468
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,109
♪ But you’ll love her... ♪

469
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,416
Okay. Didn’t really expect that.

470
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:23,723
♪ Goes dark

471
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,661
♪ You’ll love her even after that. ♪

472
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,974
Um...

473
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,583
I might die today.

474
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:46,716
Okay.

475
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,232
It’s how I get my mom back,
so I just...

476
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:54,667
needed to cross a few things
off my bucket list first.

477
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,192
Wait, was that just your first...?

478
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:58,356
Can we not talk about it?

479
00:25:08,496 --> 00:25:10,324
You should've stuck your
hand down his throat

480
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,484
and ripped out his entrails.

481
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:12,901
Instead, you let him off the hook.

482
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:14,754
To prevent you from exposing yourself.

483
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,577
Might I spend the balance of time cowed

484
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,777
and ashamed of what I am?

485
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,083
Not cowed and ashamed,
discreet and safe.

486
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:22,695
The moment you reveal yourself,
you unleash an angry horde.

487
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,827
None of whom can kill me.

488
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:26,089
Father can.

489
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,569
And given the chance, he will.

490
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,746
So why empower him
with an army to hunt you down?

491
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,927
Let’s find out how powerful
this army really is.

492
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,980
This was August and his people.

493
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,145
They did this.

494
00:25:48,877 --> 00:25:51,663
They tore these poor wretches
from their beds.

495
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,177
And they killed them
in their place of worship.

496
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:56,074
It’s not your battle, Niklaus.

497
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:58,489
Isn’t it?

498
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,080
Not this time, no.

499
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:01,777
You’re not the savior of the wolves,

500
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,866
and you cannot change
what happened here.

501
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:09,083
Klaus, please.

502
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:13,746
Those of us that matter
accept you for what you are.

503
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,922
Your acceptance rings a tad hollow

504
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:18,620
considering you stood witness
as Mother bound the part of me

505
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,013
these people want to kill.

506
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:22,319
No, I did everything
that I could to protect you.

507
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:24,191
Protect me?

508
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,323
You were ashamed of me.

509
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,587
You stood and you watched
as Mikael beat me

510
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,631
till I passed out cold.

511
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,851
I never watched you suffer!

512
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:33,956
I was beside you,

513
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:36,809
tortured and beaten without mercy.

514
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,338
Now, you tell me

515
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,688
what you want from me.

516
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:45,560
I need you to do something!

517
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:47,164
To take action

518
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,399
when people call my kind "mongrels."

519
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:50,791
Not just to talk.

520
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:52,828
Otherwise, you’re no better than those

521
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:54,719
who turned their backs
and allowed this to happen.

522
00:26:54,743 --> 00:26:56,484
I have a good mind
to stick a dagger in you,

523
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,226
put you in a coffin and stack
you atop our dear sister.

524
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,903
Niklaus, you never cease to amaze me.

525
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:10,942
So, Rebekah's letters?

526
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:12,228
"Dearest Elijah,

527
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:17,078
springtime in Chicago
is ever so inspiring."

528
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,129
Oh, Niklaus.

529
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,507
Another talent revealed.

530
00:27:23,738 --> 00:27:27,307
So how did you manage to deny
Rebekah'’s happiness this time?

531
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:30,117
Did you eviscerate this Stefan
fellow like you did Alexander?

532
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:31,729
Or did you simply toss him
from a balcony

533
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:33,102
like the unfortunate Emil?

534
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:36,231
I didn’t have a chance.

535
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,741
But eternity is long,
and I have an excellent memory.

536
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,246
Why do any of us bother?

537
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:43,577
Well, from here on out, don’t.

538
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:46,926
'Cause I'm sick and tired

539
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,145
of being betrayed by those
who claim to love me.

540
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:51,060
So go back to where you came from.

541
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,715
And next time you have word that Mikael

542
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,630
is on my trail, do us all a favor:

543
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,359
let him come.

544
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:05,980
There’s got to be
an easier way to do this.

545
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:09,122
Your blood is the key.

546
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:11,907
I just need enough
to soak the moonstone.

547
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:19,306
Anima marcam.

548
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:21,109
Iskoristi vuka.

549
00:28:21,737 --> 00:28:22,546
Anima marcam.

550
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:23,616
That word.

551
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:25,694
"Marcam."

552
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:28,504
What does it mean?

553
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:32,232
"To mark"?

554
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:33,668
"The drenched stone

555
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,323
is heated and used
to brand the afflicted."

556
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:37,803
Brand me

557
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,917
"The palms of both hands,
the soles of both feet.

558
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:42,245
"And...

559
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,546
the site of the third-eye chakra."

560
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,768
And, Hope, listen to me,

561
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:49,483
you can’t pass out
or ever stop breathing, okay?

562
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:50,835
And if I do?

563
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:52,632
Just don’t.

564
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:55,023
If you ever want me to stop... No.

565
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,819
Just do it.

566
00:28:57,463 --> 00:28:59,158
- Hope, I...
- Do it.

567
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,657
Anima marcam.

568
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,386
Iskoristi vuka.

569
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:10,089
Anima marcam.

570
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:12,495
Iskoristi vuka.

571
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,145
Anima marcam. Iskoristi vuka.

572
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:20,802
Anima marcam. Iskoristi vuka.

573
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:23,535
Anima marcam. Iskoristi vuka.

574
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,933
Anima marcam. Iskoristi vuka.

575
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,902
Anima marcam. Iskoristi vuka.

576
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:33,980
Anima marcam. Iskoristi vuka.

577
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:37,471
Anima marcam.

578
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:39,995
Iskoristi vuka.

579
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,625
I will not let my past
become your future.

580
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,129
Do you understand?

581
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:45,176
Do you understand?

582
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,046
Marcel told you.

583
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,961
He didn’t have to.
A thousand years of family

584
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:51,551
has taught me to expect betrayal
from those I hold most dear.

585
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:52,576
Bind her?

586
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:53,837
Really?

587
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,970
How many times
have you heard me rail against

588
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,798
the shame our parents gave me?

589
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:02,191
How many times have you heard me cry,

590
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:05,194
devastated over having lived
my life without my mother?

591
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:14,218
You have to go, Klaus.

592
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,296
You can’t stay here with Hope.

593
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,030
Hope, listen to me.

594
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:23,147
This ends...

595
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:24,660
now.

596
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,308
I thought you’d be gone.

597
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,986
It’s pretty hard to plan a future

598
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,511
when my past and present
are awash in death and deceit.

599
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,848
The very first time that I saw you...

600
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:13,819
I knew exactly who you were.

601
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:17,963
And yes, we have a history.

602
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,442
Your family and mine.

603
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,096
It was bloody.

604
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:32,194
It was also the first time
that I fell in love with you.

605
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:43,822
Excuse me.

606
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:45,457
I’m looking for my brother.

607
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,963
He hasn’t been in again.

608
00:31:49,697 --> 00:31:51,910
I’m not my father's daughter.

609
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:55,066
I don’t share his hatred.

610
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,096
- But he...
- can’t be reasoned with.

611
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:05,199
And there are consequences
to defying him.

612
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:07,774
I’m familiar with that kind of father.

613
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:12,967
Eventually, even the children of
such a monster are not safe,

614
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,473
and believe me, it’s
only a matter of time

615
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,499
before he turns that rage on you.

616
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:21,803
Forgive me.

617
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:31,003
Listen to me.

618
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,914
I’ve been to the railway
station and to the port;

619
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,326
I have compelled the
ticket-takers to help

620
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,265
any who want passage
out of this country.

621
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:44,869
You say my name and they will help you.

622
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:47,010
I recommend heading east.

623
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:48,840
Shanghai’s a safe place to hide out.

624
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,529
Thank you.

625
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:53,192
You’re welcome.

626
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,068
Uh, your name.

627
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:01,215
If--If I'm going to use
your name as my ticket out...

628
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,068
Of course. Elijah.

629
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:05,189
Antoinette.

630
00:33:05,635 --> 00:33:07,144
Until we meet again.

631
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,003
If we meet again.

632
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:13,846
Like I told you
when we met in New York...

633
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:17,878
...I abandoned my father’s

634
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,649
antiquated notions

635
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:22,957
and found faith in the purity
of my eternal soul.

636
00:33:24,598 --> 00:33:26,430
I live by that code

637
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,344
because it brings me peace.

638
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,581
I want to share

639
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:40,652
this life with you.

640
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:42,685
Marry you.

641
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:44,662
Bathe in the joy

642
00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:48,058
of those first moments
after sunset with you.

643
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:50,378
I love you, Elijah.

644
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:54,062
And I will be upstairs packing,

645
00:33:54,087 --> 00:33:56,933
because yes, it is time to move on.

646
00:33:57,724 --> 00:34:00,683
But I hope that it’ll be together.

647
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:20,384
Klaus Mikaelson has been
quite the busy boy today.

648
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,788
First you’re up and back
to Mystic Falls,

649
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,905
now you’re abducting
werewolves from the bayou.

650
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:29,284
If Greta'’s greatest fear
is "abominations,"

651
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:30,981
then I intend to give her that horror

652
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,983
in a never-ending nightmare.

653
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:35,029
I have a quart of Hope’s blood

654
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,900
and I will use every last drop of it

655
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:38,076
to create more hybrids.

656
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:41,722
You went behind my back.

657
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,862
You put my daughter’s life at risk

658
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:46,642
and you betrayed me.

659
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:48,214
I did what was right.

660
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,457
What was right for whom?

661
00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:51,353
For your daughter. For my city.

662
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,121
This isn’t about what was right.

663
00:34:53,146 --> 00:34:54,757
Your city rejected you.

664
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,879
So did my sister. Now all you want

665
00:34:56,904 --> 00:34:58,769
is for them to take you back.

666
00:34:59,753 --> 00:35:02,206
You just need to be loved, Marcel,

667
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,199
that’s your weakness.

668
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:05,601
That’s how I knew what you’d done

669
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,583
without you having to say a word.

670
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,344
And that’s why I know,
no matter what you promise

671
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:10,496
when you claim to be an ally,

672
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,087
you...

673
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,342
...you will always falter.

674
00:35:23,384 --> 00:35:24,472
Drink up.

675
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,620
And when you go back out into the world,

676
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:31,734
be sure to tell everybody

677
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:35,776
Greta Sienna
is responsible for your fate.

678
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:42,356
I’ve made a mistake.

679
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,995
I don’t want to die.

680
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:48,624
So... come clean about Hayley.

681
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:50,887
The second I talk, they’ll kill me.

682
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,018
Look, you’re clean of vervain.

683
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:54,915
Okay? So if you confess
without being compelled

684
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,507
and Hayley's still alive...

685
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:57,532
Oh, she is.

686
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:59,393
Very much so.

687
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:02,143
Then Klaus isn’t without compassion.

688
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,603
Where is she, Greta?

689
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:06,932
You tell me.

690
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,611
You tell me where she is,

691
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:10,476
and I will vouch for you
with Klaus and Marcel.

692
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:12,273
Please tell them.

693
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:13,252
What?

694
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:14,800
- Tell them.
- Tell them what?

695
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:17,740
Tell them I am so very much stronger

696
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,308
than they could ever imagine!

697
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,662
Hey, you didn’t die.

698
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,807
That’s pretty cool.

699
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,742
What happened?

700
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:57,446
What happened is that...

701
00:36:57,897 --> 00:37:01,857
I’m on my own, as far as getting
my mom back is concerned.

702
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:06,753
And what’s this?

703
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:10,932
A binding spell.

704
00:37:11,582 --> 00:37:13,715
All I need to do to get her back

705
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,481
is to lose a part of who I am.

706
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:18,571
And I mean, I’ve got three.

707
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:21,307
How bad could it be to lose one of them?

708
00:37:26,364 --> 00:37:27,974
Do you want to find out?

709
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:31,775
Well... none of the witches here

710
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,443
are strong enough to do this.

711
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,052
Yeah.

712
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,459
Man... if only somebody knew

713
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:43,269
a way to sneak out of here, huh?

714
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:56,308
Will he survive?

715
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:59,213
- Josh?
- Yeah.

716
00:37:59,288 --> 00:38:01,855
He’s lucky to still
have his face, but...

717
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,968
I think so.

718
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,728
Does he have any idea

719
00:38:04,753 --> 00:38:05,913
where Greta'’s gotten off to?

720
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,167
Do you remember that part

721
00:38:08,192 --> 00:38:09,976
where I said he’s lucky
to have his face?

722
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:14,675
What I said earlier...

723
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,354
I was angry.

724
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:17,837
Yeah, well...
