I'm really not.

148
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:40,912
这不是玩笑哦
It's not a joke.

149
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,969
朱迪还跟他说要一起去罗马呢
Judy's going to talk him out of going to Rome.

150
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,355
我就知道会有事情搅和我们的计划
I knew something was going to screw up our plans,

151
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:51,690
就是这事
and this is it.

152
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:54,059
她肯定会说服他永远不要离开这里的
She is going to convince him never to leave the country.

153
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,944
我觉得你可能想多了
I think you're imagining things.

154
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:58,197
哦 是吗 看看她发在脸书上的东西
Oh, yeah? Well, check out what's already on Facebook.

154
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,597
大美利坚

155
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:00,932
没有说服力
Inconclusive.

156
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:01,868
真的吗
Oh, really?

156
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,868
罗马弱爆

157
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:05,987
现在有点说服力了
It's getting conclusiver.

158
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:06,938
嘿 莉莉
Hey, Lily.

159
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,241
-怎么  -跟我来
-What? -Come on.

160
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,127
好了 张开吧
Okay, open'em.

161
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,746
你的眼睛 对不起 你应该闭上眼睛的
Your eyes-- sorry, they should have been closed.

162
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:15,747
这得怪我
That one's on me.

163
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:16,748
我们再试一次
Let's try again.

164
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,782
哇哦
Wow.

165
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:21,136
泰德 这些都是你一个人做的吗
Ted, you did this all yourself?

166
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:24,306
就像恋恋笔记本中的瑞恩•高斯林那样
Just like Ryan Gosling in The Notebook.

166
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:24,306
{\a6}瑞恩•高斯林 加拿大演员

167
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,258
我今天一直很男人 直到我提到
I was pretty manly till I mentioned

168
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,393
恋恋笔记本中的瑞恩•高斯林 对吧
Ryan Gosling in The Notebook, huh?

169
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,978
连我都没看过这部电影 泰德
Even I haven't seen it, Ted.

170
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,564
想象一下吧 你的孩子们
Just think, this is the house

171
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,182
会在这间房子里长大
your kids are going to grow up in.

172
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:38,970
他们会在这个壁炉里烤棉花糖
They are going to roast marshmallows in this fireplace.

174
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,023
他们会在前庭那边
They're gonna experiment

175
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:42,190
尝尝快活小丸丸
with recreational drugs on that porch.

177
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:44,776
他们会坐在放在这里的沙发上
They're gonna sit on a couch right here

178
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:46,495
听你讲那些无聊的故事 关于
and listen to your boring stories about...

179
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:49,698
"待售"牌
"For sale" Sign?

180
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:52,284
你要把这间房子卖了吗
Are you selling this place?

181
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,453
是啊
Yeah.

182
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,954
为什么啊
Why?

183
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,926
因为我要搬去芝加哥
Because I'm moving to Chicago.

184
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:08,805
嗷
Ow.

185
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,353
那 我们要怎么弄
So, what are we gonna do--

186
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:11,555
在他们吃的东西里加点料
put something in their food,

187
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,573
在他们车子上划几道 噢
key their car? Ooh,

188
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:15,275
你的雪茄里面有会爆炸的那种吗
do either of those cigars explode?

189
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:18,378
悠着点 大野狼 我想到一个好点子
Hold on, Wile E. Coyote, I think I got something.

189
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:18,378
{\a6}来源于动画《哔哔鸟和大野狼》

190
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,631
他在打量那个迎宾员
He's checking out the hostess.

191
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:25,101
正处于欢快约会中的男人用这样的眼光偷瞄
Now, a guy who's happily in a relationship sees a girl

192
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:29,823
别的女人的话 他偷瞄的次数将可达14-15次
like that, he'll check her out maybe 14, 15 times, tops.

193
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,375
16次 封顶了
16 times, tops.

194
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:36,246
这么说 克里耳屎汀在这段关系里比她奸夫
So Krirsten's more invested in the relationship

195
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,381
要投入的多啊
than her fella is.

196
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,166
这可以用来大做文章
That could spell trouble.

197
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,135
接受挑战
Challenge accepted.

198
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,288
嘿 你说一个新娘在她婚礼之前
Hey, do you think it's bad luck for a bride

199
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,258
把一对陌生人给拆散了会不会有点败人品啊
to break up two strangers a week before her wedding?

200
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,646
我说这相当败人品啊...败克里耳屎汀的人品
I'd say it's very bad luck... for Krirsten.

201
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,637
噢 我恨死这桌子了
Ow, I hate this table so much!

202
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,356
你为什么要搬去芝加哥啊
Why would you move to Chicago?

204
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,158
因为那儿是我的完美之城
Because it's the perfect town for me.

205
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,277
它像是克利夫兰化的纽约
I-It's like a Clevelandy New York,

206
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,811
而且 不知道你有没有注意到
and-- don't act like you haven't noticed--

207
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,114
我的头发风中凌乱时特别好看
my hair excels in the wind.

207
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,114
{\a6}芝加哥外号风城 常年大风

208
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,165
另外
Besides,

209
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,416
你们也搬去罗马了
you're moving to Rome.

210
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:16,002
但是只去一年啊 而且等我们回来时
Yeah, for a year, a-and when we get back,

211
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:18,171
需要看到你在这儿等着我们啊
we need you to be here waiting for us,

212
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:21,841
没准是和你未来的新娘生活在这间房子里
hopefully living in this house with your future bride.

213
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,044
什么...什么未来的新娘
Wha... what future bride?

214
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,095
那个女孩
The girl.

215
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:26,112
她现在正在
She's out there

216
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:28,131
外面的纽约城里四处溜达
walking around New York City right now,

217
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,767
没准穿着一双特别可爱的靴子
probably in a pair of really cute boots

218
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,669
我想穿的时候 她就会借给我
that she's gonna let me borrow whenever I want

219
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:33,887
因为我们有一样的尺码
because we're the same size.

220
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,555
她就在那外面 泰德
She is out there, Ted.

221
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,274
她真的在吗 可是我都找遍了
Is she, really? Because I've looked.

222
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,309
我苦苦寻觅
I have looked high

223
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,561
希望能找到一个可以让我喜欢
and low for someone I can love

224
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,980
让我爱慕 让我为她做华夫饼的人
and adore and cook waffles for.

225
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,532
可是现在最接近的人就只有马修啊
The closest I've come is Marshall.

226
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:46,683
他确实挺喜欢你做的华夫饼的
He does love your waffles.

227
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:47,850
是肉桂的缘故啦
It's the cinnamon.

228
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:49,369
我都会加肉桂的
I add cinnamon.

229
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:52,322
她根本没在纽约
She's not in New York.

230
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,856
或许她会在芝加哥
Maybe she's in Chicago.

231
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:56,660
好 你现在是越说越离谱了
Okay, you are being ridiculous.

232
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,162
你会在这儿 在纽约城里 找到那个人
You are going to find someone here in New York

233
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,247
而且你会爱她 就像我爱马修一样
that you love just as much as I love Marshall.

234
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,632
至于你
And you,

235
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:06,703
如果你让朱迪说服你不去意大利的话 我发誓
if you let Judy talk you out of going to Italy, so help me,

236
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:10,507
我的意大利饺子将永远对你的馅料关上大门
I will never let you stuff my ravioli again.

237
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,258
我还是把扬声器关了吧
I'm gonna take you off speaker.

238
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,543
莉莉 你就放一百万个心吧
Lily, you got to relax.

239
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:16,596
我妈对意大利这事可激动了
Okay, my mom is psyched about Italy.

240
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,064
她一直在开玩笑说
She keeps making jokes about how she's gonna

241
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:21,768
她要跟我们一起去罗马睡沙发
come live with us in Rome and sleep on the couch

242
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,069
给我们做饭
and cook every meal for us

243
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,071
我们在那的一整年
so we never have to go to a restaurant

244
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:26,222
都不用下馆子
the whole year we're there.

245
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:27,273
这不是玩笑哦
It's not a joke.

246
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,841
现在不准对我说不
By not saying no to me right now,

247
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:32,529
你得保证让我跟你们去罗马才行
you are giving me your full consent for that to happen.

249
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,735
我得挂了
I got to go.

250
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,903
我要说些政治上的东西
"I'm probably saying some political stuff

251
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:42,172
以显得我很聪明
right now to sound smart."

252
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,708
我更喜欢傲慢自大的播客
"I'm probably referring to some snooty podcast

253
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,593
以显得我更聪明
to sound even smarter."

254
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,128
我要讲法语了
"I'm probably saying something in French."

255
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,345
啊
Aah!

256
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,346
我的天...
My God...

257
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:52,265
噢
Ow.

258
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,266
好了
Okay,

259
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,284
你想要拆散他们吗
you want to break them up?

260
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,468
我有一个计划
I got a plan.

261
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,637
这计划以前成功过
It's something I know has worked in the past,

262
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,055
但是 有风险
but it-it's, it's risky,

263
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,558
所以 现在取消还来得及
so it's, it's not too late to call it off.

264
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,290
不 我也参与
No way, I'm in.

265
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,145
很好 其实现在想取消已经来不及了
Good, 'cause it's too late to call it off.

266
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,979
好戏开始
Observe.

267
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,197
这就是为什么参议院
And that is why the senate

268
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,698
不能通过任何议案
can't push anything through.

269
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,018
道格•曼德在他的播客里也是这么说的
And Doug Mand said the same thing in his podcast.

270
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,725
就像是"身后之事与我何干"
It's like, "Apres moi le deluge!"

271
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:18,775
噢
Ooh.

272
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:19,793
噢 天啊
Oh, my gosh.

273
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:21,327
噢 我的天 噢 我的神
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

274
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,580
好 好 好
Yes, yes, yes.

275
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:24,714
我愿意
Yes!

276
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:25,465
什么
What?

277
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,783
我愿意
Yes!

278
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:27,950
我愿意嫁给你
I will marry you!

279
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:29,502
就算是香槟杯子里的戒指
Even though a ring in a champagne glass

280
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,254
这样的老套的方法 就算这是个长角阶梯型戒指
is a total cliche and this is a cushion cut.

281
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,289
就算我暗示过你 我想要公主方形的戒指
And how long have I been hinting that I want a princess cut?

282
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,424
我也愿意
But yes!

283
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,975
这是个误会 这戒指不是我的
That's a mistake. That's not from me.

284
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,960
不是你的
It's not?

285
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:41,231
我们在一起才七年而已
We've only been together seven years.

286
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,150
-现在清楚了 -开始了
-Now it becomes clear. -Here we go.

287
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:44,981
你想像当时承诺
You want commitment the

288
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:46,603
给我弟弟工作那样敷衍我
same way you want my brother to work for you.

289
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,356
很抱歉我没有在酒杯里面放戒指
I'm sorry I didn't put an engagement ring in your drink.

290
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,642
从你以往大口喝酒的经验来看 我很惊讶你居然发现了戒指
The way you chug booze, I'm surprised you even noticed.

291
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:54,811
那么 你什么时候走
So, when are you leaving?

292
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,279
婚礼后的第一天
Day after the wedding.

293
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,447
什么
What?

294
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,616
你不能错过婚礼后的第一天
You can't miss the day after the wedding.

295
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,836
那一天我们要不醉不归 喝含羞草鸡尾酒
That's when we sit around all hungover, drinking mimosas

296
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:05,038
然后八卦一下谁长胖了
and talking smack about who looked fat.

297
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,006
那相当于我的圣诞节
That's my Christmas.

298
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:10,176
你为什么这么着急要走呢
Why are you in such a rush to get out of there?

299
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,013
噢
Oh.

300
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:16,499
当然了
Of course.

301
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,601
你离开这里的原因并不是因为
You're not leaving because you think

302
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:20,770
你认为你的真命天女不在纽约
the love of your life isn't in New York.

303
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,939
你离开这里是因为 你觉得你的她就在那里
You're leaving because you think she is.

304
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,324
然而下周的这个时候
And this time next week,

305
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:27,360
她就嫁给你最好的朋友了
she'll be married to your best friend.

306
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,814
亲爱的
Baby!

307
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,014
我这里正在上演
I am in the middle

308
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,366
非常戏剧化的一幕
of something super dramatic here.

309
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:36,202
但是 你记住了 如果你让朱迪和我们一起去罗马
But real quick: If you let Judy come to Rome with us,

310
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,071
你就得另找人
you are going to have to find someone else

311
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,156
帮你洗衣服 做脚底按摩了
to do your laundry and massage your feet.

312
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,293
哦 天 她都做得到是吧
Oh, my gosh, she's going to do all that, won't she?

313
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,211
莉莉 你不用再这么抓狂了
Lily, you have to stop freaking out.

314
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,630
没有任何事情会打破我们的计划
Nothing is going to screw up the plan.

315
00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,115
我们一定会按计划执行
We're doing this.

316
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:50,550
我爱你
I love you.

317
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,502
我爱你 亲爱的 拜拜
I love you, baby. Bye.

344
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,976
-不行  -我可以用全息图像办案吗

346
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,664
像总统大厅里面机器人亚伯拉罕•林肯那种
like Abe Lincoln from the Hall of Presidents

347
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,515
我可以用操纵杆遥控那种

00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:01,343
又能和我妻子搬去意大利住一年呢
and also spend the next year of my life in Italy with my wife?

354
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,228
没有
No.

355
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,297
这真是个重大决定啊
This is such a big decision.

356
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,516
我真的不擅长做重大决定
I-I'm not good at big decisions.

357
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:09,302
你确定你真要当法官吗
Are you sure you want to be a judge?

358
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:14,023
哇噢 我们刚刚打碎了一段长达7年的恋情
Wow. Now that we've broken up a seven-year relationship

359
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,725
只是因为他们占了我们的桌子
just 'cause they stole our table,

360
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,610
-我觉得有点...  -棒极了
-I feel kind of... -Awesome?

361
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:20,196
我打算说"欲火中烧" 但没错 也很棒
I was going to say horny, but yeah, awesome, too.

362
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,450
不是吧
No way.

363
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:24,868
-开玩笑吧  -什么
-Are you kidding me? -What?

364
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,069
哇 这是要来打架吗
Whoa. Is there going to be a fight?

365
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,320
好吧 那就这样
Okay, here's the play.

366
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,289
你负责放倒那个妞 还有那个男的 我旁观
You take the girl, and the guy and I will watch.

367
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,858
你们好呀 我们正想找你们呢
Hello. Just the people we want to see.

368

因为你们 我俩大吵了一架
We got in a pretty big fight because of you guys.

369
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,297
还约心理医生谈了好几个小时
We had to call our therapists after hours.

370
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,299
可不爽了呢
Not cool.

371
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,134
总而言之 这事导致了我们现在的结果
Anyway, it got us to where we are now.

372
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:42,585
我们要结婚了
We're getting married!

373
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:44,671
而且我会跟她姓
And I'm taking her last name.

374
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,256
你们也应该考虑这样做
You should think about doing the same thing.

375
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,974
-那晚安咯  -晚安
-Well, good night. -Good night.

376
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,676
-晚安  -恭喜你们
-Good night. -Congratulations.

377
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:52,011
是啊 必须恭喜
Yes, definitely.

378
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:54,230
是因为我们
That was us.

379
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:57,100
我们促成了这桩喜事
We made that happen.

380
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,018
我们太帅了
We're pretty cool.

381

你知道 再过一周
And, you know, a week from today,

00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:05,742
夫妻
Married.

384
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,677
传奇夫妻×2
-Legend-married. -Legend-married.

385
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:13,116
罗宾•舍巴斯基 我太特么爱你了
Robin Scherbatsky, I love you so damn much.

386
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,702
我也爱你 巴尼•舍巴斯基
I love you, too, Barney Scherbatsky.

387
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:17,370
听上去不错
That sounds good.

388
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:18,922
-嘘  -考虑一下吧
-Shh. -Think about it.

389
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,423
他们很幸福
They're happy.

390
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,342
我也很为他们高兴
And I'm happy for them.

391
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:24,794
我希望他们共度精彩的人生 只是
I want them to have an amazing life together. I just...

392
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:26,846
我只是觉得 我不参与其中
I just think it would be best for everyone

393 
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,131
会对所有人都好
if I wasn't around for it.

394
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,051
最近你跟罗宾之间发生什么事了吗
Did something happen recently between you and Robin?

395
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:33,636
没有
No.

396
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,338
便便埋哪儿了 泰德
Where's the poop, Ted?

396
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,338
{\a6}{\fs16}S06E03出现过 罗宾和唐分手后莉莉追问罗宾的台词

397
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,442
那天她给我打电话
She called me up the other day.

398
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:41,260
想要挖出那个埋在中央公园
She was trying to dig up this locket

399
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:43,196
旋转木马后面的吊坠小盒
she had buried behind the Central Park Carousel,

400
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,265
我推掉了一场很重要的面试去帮她
and I blew off that big interview to go help her.

401
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:50,286
后来 下起了雨
And then... it started raining.

402
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:55,408
我 呃
I'll, uh...

403
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,626
婚礼上见
I'll see you at the wedding.

404
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,277
嗯
Yeah.

405
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,296
即使是现在 已经过了这么多年
Even now, after all these years,

406
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:02,632
我心中仍然有一个角落驱使着我
there's still just this part of me where,

407
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,250
就算只有最渺茫的机会
if there's even the slightest chance

408
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:06,118
能让我使罗宾展开笑颜
something I do could make Robin smile,

409
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,222
我都绝不多想 义无反顾
I don't even think about it-- I just do it.

410
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:10,473
我是说 如果我能让吊坠小盒
I mean, if I could make

411
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,392
奇迹般出现 我肯定去做
that locket magically appear, I would.

412
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,460
哪怕要切开我手臂上的脉络
I would open a vein in my arm

413
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,646
让吊坠从我的血液中流淌出来
if I could bleed that locket out,

414
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:18,815
只要能让她开心
just to make her happy.

415
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,102
而对方却是你最好朋友的未婚妻
That's just a really sucky way to feel

416
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:25,471
这真的再难堪不过了
about your best friend's fiancee.

417
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,410
所以 我会去参加婚礼
So I'm going to come to the wedding,

418
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:33,363
你知道 愉快地度过 但那之后...
you know, I'll have a good time, but after that, I...

419
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,565
怎么了
What?

420
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:39,836
我知道那个吊坠小盒在哪
I know where the locket is.

421
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,421
什么
What?

422
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,539
我知道那个吊坠小盒在哪
I know where the locket is.

423
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,458
那是几年之前
It-it was a few years ago,

424
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,126
就在你要和斯黛拉结婚之前
right before you were supposed to marry Stella.

424
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,800
{\a6}2008年

425
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,805
有天晚上我去酒吧喝点东西
I went down to the bar one night to get a drink

426
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,713
然后碰见了谁呢
and what should I see?

427
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:51,848
莉莉
Lily!

428
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,683
嘿 小妞
Hey, girl.

429
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,568
问你个问题啊
I got a question for you.

430
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:59,171
泰德要娶的为什么不是我
Why isn't Ted marrying me?

431
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,440
噢
Whoa

432
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,442
对不起 哦 天哪
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

433
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,943
对不起
I'm sorry.

434
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:07,313
我只是... 我应该为他感到开心的
I just... I-I should be happy for him,

435
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:09,348
可我却是这个样子
and yet here I am,

436
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,069
打算搬去日本住 仅仅是为了躲开他
moving off to Japan just to get away from him.

437
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,154
还有大概想去看看
And-and I guess to see those...

438
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:18,041
兵马俑和长城什么的
those terra-cotta warriors and the Great Wall.

439
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,626
那是中国
Well, that's China.

440
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:20,860
哪个 这个吗
What? This?

441
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:22,295
不 这只是个纸盘子
No, it's just a paper plate.

442
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:22,305
{\a6}china还有陶瓷的意思 罗宾以为莉莉说盘子是陶瓷的

442
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,715
呃 咱还是离开这儿吧
Uh, we should get out of here.

443
