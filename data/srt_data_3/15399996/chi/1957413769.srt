1
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,346
Mr Hulton's waiting for you
in the yard, Mr Herriot.

1
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,346
Hulton 先生
在院子里等你，Herriot 先生。

2
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:57,971
Thank you.

2
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:57,971
谢谢你。

3
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,920
Mrs Hall?

3
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:06,920
霍尔太太？

4
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,531
Look at this, Mrs Hall.

4
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,531
看看这个，霍尔夫人。

5
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:14,464
There's a hole in my
cricket flannels. So there is.

5
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:14,464
我的
板球法兰绒上有一个洞。所以有。

6
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:16,511
I can't wear them
on Sunday with a hole.

6
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:16,511
我不能
在星期天穿有洞的。

7
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,875
What would Mrs Pumphrey say?

7
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,875
Pumphrey 夫人会怎么说？

8
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,604
It's a good thing the Lord
invented darning then. Right.

8
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,604
那时上帝
发明了织补是一件好事。对。

9
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:21,648
Thank you.

9
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:21,648
谢谢你。

10
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:26,263
I've just been speaking to
Richard Alderson. Oh, aye?

10
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:26,263
我刚刚和
理查德·奥尔德森谈过。哦，是吗？

11
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:28,229
Apparently, we're still a man
short for Sunday.

11
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:28,229
显然，我们仍然是一个
缺少星期天的人。

12
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,844
It's bad enough that we've
lost our top batsman.

12
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,844
我们
失去了顶级击球手，这已经够糟糕了。

13
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:37,459
Tristan, I know you're still unhappy
with me, but this - this is cricket.

13
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:37,459
特里斯坦，我知道你仍然对
我不满意，但这是 - 这是板球。

14
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:40,710
The annual Darrowby
match at Pumphrey Manor.

14
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:40,710
一年一度的 Darrowby
比赛在 Pumphrey Manor 举行。

15
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,957
You're not just punishing me,
you know,

15
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,957
你不只是在惩罚我，
你知道，

16
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:45,285
you're letting down the whole team.
Look, I told you -

16
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:45,285
你让整个团队都失望了。
看，我告诉过你——

17
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:48,014
I can't play for the Darrowby 11 any
more. Oh, that's just nonsense!

17
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:48,014
我不能再为 Darrowby 11 演奏了
。哦，那简直是胡说八道！

18
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:51,946
It's for local farmers
and vets by invitation.

18
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:51,946
它是由当地农民
和兽医邀请的。

19
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,515
And I, last time I checked,
am neither.

19
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,515
而我，上次检查时，
两者都不是。

20
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:18,232
Herriot.

20
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:18,232
赫里奥特。

21
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:22,045
Thanks so much for coming out.
No trouble at all.

21
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:22,045
非常感谢你出来。
一点都不麻烦。

22
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:25,255
I understand you've a bull needs
ringing? I do indeed. This way.

22
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:25,255
我知道你有一头公牛需要
敲响？我确实。这边走。

23
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,642
Here he is.

23
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,642
他在这里。

24
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:35,167
This is Monty.

24
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:35,167
这是蒙蒂。

25
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,375
Only a year old,
but he's a powerful fellow.

25
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,375
才一岁，
却是个厉害的家伙。

26
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,184
No, I can see that! We also need to
move him later today,

26
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,184
不，我看得出来！
今天晚些时候我们也需要移动他，

27
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:42,712
so if you could sedate him
once you've got the ring in.

27
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:42,712
所以如果你能在戴上
戒指后让他镇静下来。

28
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,277
That shouldn't be a problem.

28
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:44,277
那应该不是问题。

29
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,645
HE GRUMBLES

29
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,645
他抱怨

30
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:49,093
I will need a couple more men to
hold him, though.

30
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:49,093
不过，我还需要几个男人来
抱他。

31
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:50,136
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

31
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:50,136
他清了嗓子

32
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,119
So, Hugh definitely said
it was about a bull?

32
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,119
所以，休肯定说
这是关于公牛的？

33
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:01,654
That's what he said. He's got a new
bull that needs ringing.

33
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:01,654
他就是这么说的。他有一只
需要振铃的新公牛。

34
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:04,383
And he specifically asked for James?

34
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:04,383
他还特地问了詹姆斯？

35
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:06,028
He did.

35
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:06,028
他做到了。

36
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:08,757
It's about Helen.
It's got to be.

36
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:08,757
是关于海伦的。
它必须是。

37
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:11,927
I reckon James'
sins finally found him out.

37
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:11,927
我想詹姆斯的
罪孽终于找到了他。

38
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:13,252
Don't be daft.

38
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:13,252
别傻了。

39
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,860
James has done nothing wrong.

39
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,860
詹姆斯没有做错任何事。

40
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,345
Tell that to Hugh Hulton.

40
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,345
告诉休·赫尔顿。

41
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,106
I won't be a moment.

41
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,106
我不会是片刻。

42
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,795
Just going to give him an injection
of local anaesthetic.

42
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,795
刚打算给他打一针局
麻药。

43
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,083
Don't most vets just go ahead
and punch the hole?

43
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,083
大多数兽医不是直接
冲孔吗？

44
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,972
They do...
CALF GRUMBLES

44
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,972
他们确实......
小腿咕噜声

45
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:40,179
I find this way works better.

45
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:40,179
我发现这种方式效果更好。

46
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,456
HE GROWLS

46
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,456
他咆哮

47
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,382
All right, almost done...

47
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,382
好了，差不多完成了……

48
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:57,395
Easy now.

48
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:57,395
现在很容易。

49
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:03,656
FLESH PUNCTURES

49
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:03,656
肉刺

50
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:06,304
Huh, look at that.
Didn't bother him at all.

50
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:06,304
呵呵，看那个。
根本没有打扰他。

51
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,348
It usually works.

51
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,348
它通常有效。

52
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:11,843
Now, we just need the ring...

52
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:11,843
现在，我们只需要戒指...

53
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,698
So have I missed very much
while I've been away in France?

53
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,698
那么我
在法国旅行期间是否非常想念？

54
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:21,032
Er, no, not that I can think of.
No great Darrowby dramas to report?

54
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:21,032
呃，不，不是我能想到的。
没有伟大的达罗比戏剧要报道？

55
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:23,320
No, just things chugging along,
you know.

55
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:23,320
不，只是事情进展顺利，
你知道。

56
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,092
Have you seen much of Helen?

56
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,092
你见过很多海伦吗？

57
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:30,383
No, not a great deal.

57
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:30,383
不，不是很多。

58
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:33,232
But, well, now and again, you know.

58
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:33,232
但是，嗯，时不时地，你知道。

59
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,597
She seems well, does she?

59
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,597
她看起来很好，是吗？

60
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:36,964
Yes... Yes, far as I can tell.

60
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:36,964
是的……是的，据我所知。

61
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:38,931
Right, shall we get on with this,
then?

61
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:38,931
对了，那我们继续
吗？

62
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,820
I'm going up there later, actually,
to Heston Grange. Oh, yes?

62
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,820
我稍后会去那里，实际上，
去赫斯顿格兰奇。哦是的？

63
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,864
HE GROWLS

63
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,864
他咆哮

64
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,445
Whoa! Easy, Monty.
I say, James, are you all right?

64
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,445
哇！容易，蒙蒂。
我说，詹姆斯，你还好吗？

65
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:51,692
Come on ,Monty now.
Calm down.

65
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:51,692
来吧，蒙蒂。
冷静下来。

66
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,140
I think I'll live. Glad to hear it.

66
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,140
我想我会活下去。听到那个消息很开心。

67
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,672
THEY CHUCKLE

67
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,672
他们咯咯地笑

68
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,892
DOGS BARK, YAP

68
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,892
狗吠，做

69
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:11,477
So what's the verdict? Any hope?
Oh, there's always hope.

69
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:11,477
那么判决结果是什么？有希望吗？
哦，总是有希望的。

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,410
The adjustment nut's a bit stiff,
but once I've worked it loose,

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,410
调整螺母有点僵硬，
但一旦我松开它，

71
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,741
I can raise the bob
and she'll run right to time.

71
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,741
我可以举起鲍勃
，她会及时跑。

72
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:19,784
That's all it needs?

72
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:19,784
这就是它所需要的吗？

73
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:23,155
Well, you have to know how
far to raise it.

73
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:23,155
好吧，您必须知道
将其提高到什么程度。

74
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,533
Oh, of course. I don't doubt it
takes a lot of expertise.

74
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,533
哦，当然。我不怀疑这
需要很多专业知识。

75
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,777
Oh, don't know about that.

75
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,777
哦，不知道这个。

76
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,030
The main thing to remember is
lower is slower and left is lower.

76
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,030
要记住的主要事情是
较低的速度较慢，而左侧的较低。

77
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,679
Turn it to the right,
it'll go faster.

77
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,679
向右转，
它会跑得更快。

78
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:37,722
That's it.

78
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:37,722
就是这样。

79
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:42,458
Ah, so you've a cricketer
in the house. Hm?

79
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:42,458
啊，所以你
家里有一个板球运动员。嗯？

80
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,625
Oh, we've two.

80
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,625
哦，我们有两个。

81
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,635
But it's Mr Farnon Senior who's
playing in the match on Sunday.

81
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,635
但
参加周日比赛的是老法农先生。

82
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:50,926
To be honest, I've never
understood the appeal.

82
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:50,926
老实说，我从来没有
理解这种吸引力。

83
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,494
I know,
and I call myself a Yorkshireman!

83
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,494
我知道，
我称自己为约克郡人！

84
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:54,738
SHE CHUCKLES

84
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:54,738
她笑了

85
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:57,025
You'll be at the match, I take it?
I will.

85
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:57,025
你会参加比赛，我接受吗？
我会。

86
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,192
In fact, I'll be scoring.

86
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,192
事实上，我会得分。

87
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,400
Ah, so you're something
of an expert?

87
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,400
啊，所以你是
专家？

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,406
An amateur enthusiast, perhaps.

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,406
也许是业余爱好者。

89
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:07,299
Anyway, I'll...

89
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:07,299
反正我会...

90
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,509
I'll let you get on.

90
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,509
我让你上。

91
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,837
Oh, and thanks for the tea. Mm-hm.

91
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:12,837
哦，谢谢你的茶。嗯嗯。

92
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:24,114
What time did Hugh say he'd be up?
11 o'clock.

92
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:24,114
休说他几点起床？
11点钟。

93
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:26,722
And he just said it
where about the lease? He did.

93
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:26,722
他只是说
租约在哪里？他做到了。

94
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:30,414
So d'you think he wants to sell?

94
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:30,414
所以你认为他想卖吗？

95
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:33,344
Is that what he's coming to tell us?
You know as much as I do.

95
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:33,344
这是他来告诉我们的吗？
你知道的和我一样多。

96
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:42,614
What if he's decided
not to renew the lease

96
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:42,614
如果他决定
不续租怎么办

97
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,500
because of what happened between me
and him?

97
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,500
因为我
和他之间发生了什么？

98
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,707
Then I'd say you were right
not to marry him.

98
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,707
那么我会说你
不嫁给他是对的。

99
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,209
PHONE RINGS

99
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,209
电话铃声

100
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:54,974
Darrowby, 2-2-9-7.

100
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:54,974
达罗比，2-2-9-7。

101
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:57,262
I'm sorry, I can barely hear you.

101
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:57,262
对不起，我几乎听不到你的声音。

102
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:58,827
Ah, Mrs Pumphrey!

102
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:58,827
啊，普弗里夫人！

103
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:00,994
Hello, is everything all right?

103
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:00,994
你好，一切都好吗？

104
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,482
Mr Farnon?

104
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,482
法农先生？

105
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,171
No, I see.

105
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,171
不，我明白了。

106
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,060
Well of course, if it's a
matter of "great delicacy".

106
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,060
当然，如果
是“美味佳肴”的话。

107
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:12,632
I'll tell him now.

107
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:12,632
我现在就告诉他。

108
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:15,561
That was Mrs Pumphrey.

108
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:15,561
那是 Pumphrey 夫人。

109
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,327
She asked if you could go up
to the manor.

109
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,327
她问你是否可以去
庄园。

110
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:20,337
Doesn't she want Tricki's
Uncle Herriot? Apparently not.

110
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:20,337
她不是想要特里奇的赫里奥
叔叔吗？显然不是。

111
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:23,828
She said the matter requires
the utmost discretion.

111
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:23,828
她说这件事需要
最大的自由裁量权。

112
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:25,072
Intriguing. Mm-hm!

112
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:25,072
耐人寻味。嗯嗯！

113
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,972
"The utmost discretion"?

113
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:30,972
“最大的自由裁量权”？

114
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,460
What's all that about?

114
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,460
那是怎么回事？

115
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,787
I've no idea -
she said she'll only discuss it

115
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,787
我不知道 -
她说她只会讨论它

116
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,633
with Siegfried... In person.

116
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,633
与齐格弗里德...亲自。

117
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,600
Hm!

117
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,600
嗯！

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,968
So, spill the beans.

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,968
所以，洒豆子。

119
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,613
What happened at Hulton Hall?

119
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,613
休尔顿厅发生了什么？

120
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,338
Not a great deal.

120
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:45,338
不是很多。

121
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:48,108
What, Hugh didn't challenge you
to a duel for Helen's hand?

121
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:48,108
什么，休没有挑战你
为了海伦的手决斗？

122
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,556
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but, no.

122
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,556
很抱歉让你失望了，
但是，不。

123
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,402
Well, has he seen her yet?

123
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,402
嗯，他见过她吗？

124
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:54,609
Er, no, he said he was going up
later today.

124
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:54,609
呃，不，他说他
今天晚点上去。

125
00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:57,578
And that doesn't bother you?

125
00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:57,578
这不打扰你吗？

126
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,110
Of course not. Why should it?

126
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,110
当然不是。为什么要呢？

127
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,394
No reason.

127
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,394
没理由。

128
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,414
Where are you off to? Nowhere.

128
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,414
你要去哪里？无处。

129
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:11,343
I just, erm...
I need run an errand. Oh.

129
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:11,343
我只是，呃...
我需要跑腿。哦。

130
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,356
He's here!

130
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,356
他在这儿！

131
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,249
He's here.

131
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,249
他在这儿。

132
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,803
Hullo there. How do.

132
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,803
你好。怎么办。

133
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,786
You got back all right, then?

133
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,786
那你回来还好吗？

134
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:38,672
I did. Yes. Thank you.

134
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:38,672
我做到了。是的。谢谢你。

135
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:44,371
Can I make you a cup of tea? Er, no,
no, thanks. I can't stay long.

135
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:44,371
我可以给你泡杯茶吗？呃，不，
不，谢谢。我不能久留。

136
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:47,180
You said you wanted to speak to us
about the lease?

136
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:47,180
你说你想和我们
谈谈租约？

137
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,866
Yes, yes, that's right. Er...

137
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,866
是的，是的，没错。呃...

138
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:51,635
Ah, here we go.

138
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:51,635
啊，我们走了。

139
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,537
I intend to renew the lease
on the farm

139
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,537
我打算续签
农场的租约

140
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,784
for the agreed period of 20 years,

140
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,784
在约定的 20 年期间，

141
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:02,791
as per our existing contract,

141
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:02,791
根据我们现有的合同，

142
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,162
but with a couple of
additional stipulations.

142
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,162
但有一些
额外的规定。

143
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,981
The lawyers have added
Helen's and Jenny's names

143
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,981
律师加了
海伦和珍妮的名字

144
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:15,793
and specified that they'll inherit
the lease on the same terms.

144
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:15,793
并指定他们将以
相同的条款继承租约。

145
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,041
That's assuming that they want
to continue farming.

145
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,041
那是假设他们想
继续耕种。

146
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,850
That's wonderful. Thank you.

146
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,850
那好极了。谢谢你。

147
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,054
Thank you, Hugh.

147
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,054
谢谢你，休。

148
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,070
It's very good of you.
Not at all, it's...something

148
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,070
你真好。
一点也不，它是……东西

149
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,037
that should have been done years
ago, but erm...

149
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,037
那应该在几年
前完成的，但是呃...

150
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:31,404
Well, it didn't really seem
necessary before.

150
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:31,404
好吧，以前似乎没有
必要这样做。

151
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:34,334
Er...

151
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:34,334
Er...

152
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:36,822
Anyway, I think that
just about covers it.

152
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:36,822
无论如何，我认为这
几乎涵盖了它。

153
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:41,236
I don't want to take up too
much of your time,

153
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:41,236
我不想占用你太多
时间

154
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:44,286
but there's something I'd like
to show you, back at the farm.

154
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:44,286
但有件事我想
给你看，回到农场。

155
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,134
I don't understand. Consider it a
replacement, or apology,

155
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,134
我不明白。把它
当作替代品或道歉，

156
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:14,264
if you like, for the difficulties
with the sale of your last bull.

156
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:14,264
如果你愿意，因为
出售你最后一头公牛的困难。

157
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,832
Hugh,, this is too much...
We can't accept this.

157
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,832
休，这太过分了……
我们不能接受。

158
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,320
Please, Mr Alderson.
It would mean a great deal.

158
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,320
拜托了，奥尔德森先生。
这将意味着很多。

159
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,009
He's good breeding stock,
excellent condition...

159
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,009
他是优良种畜，
条件极佳...

160
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,618
Ah, well even so...
I would really like to make amends.

160
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,618
啊，即便如此……
我真的很想弥补。

161
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,069
Dad, why don't we think about it,
eh?

161
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,069
爸爸，我们为什么不考虑一下，
嗯？

162
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,875
That's all I ask.

162
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,875
这就是我要问的。

163
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,965
Just keep him here for now
and let me know what you decide.

163
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,965
现在
就让他留在这里，让我知道你的决定。

164
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,453
Right. All right, then. Excellent.

164
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,453
对。那好吧。优秀。

165
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,349
Right, better get on.

165
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,349
对，最好继续。

166
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:47,613
Hugh.

166
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:47,613
休。

167
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,061
Do you have to rush straight
off? Afraid so.

167
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,061
需要直接冲
吗？怕是这样。

168
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:53,432
Estate business has rather piled up
while I've been away.

168
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:53,432
我不在的时候，房地产生意就堆积如山。

169
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:55,358
No doubt see
you at the cricket on Sunday.

169
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:55,358
毫无疑问
，周日板球赛上见。

170
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:56,682
You will. Jolly good.

170
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:56,682
你会。欢乐的好。

171
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:15,664
Thank you so much for coming.

171
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:15,664
非常感谢你的到来。

172
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:18,754
Not at all, I understand
Tricki has been rather distressed?

172
00:11:15,664 --> 00:11:18,754
完全没有，我知道
Tricki 一直很苦恼？

173
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,480
He's not himself at all.

173
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,480
他根本不是他自己。

174
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,767
Is he off his food?
Feeling lethargic?

174
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,767
他不吃东西了吗？
感觉昏昏欲睡？

175
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:25,055
Oh, no, no, there's no
problem in that department.

175
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:25,055
哦，不，不，
那个部门没有问题。

176
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,867
In fact, if anything, his appetite's
more robust than ever.

176
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,867
事实上，如果有的话，他的胃口
比以往任何时候都更加旺盛。

177
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,874
No, it's just, erm...

177
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,874
不，这只是，呃...

178
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:33,201
He's become...

178
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:33,201
他变成了...

179
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:34,646
..increasingly...

179
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:34,646
..日益...

180
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:39,903
..amorous towards things.

180
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:39,903
..对事物充满热情。

181
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,589
It's quite unsettling.

181
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,589
这很令人不安。

182
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,117
In the end,
I had to take his cushion away.

182
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,117
最后，
我不得不把他的垫子拿走。

183
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,043
HE SNEEZES

183
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,043
他打喷嚏

184
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:47,087
I see...

184
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:47,087
我懂了...

185
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,578
Well, let's have a look at him,
shall we?

185
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,578
好吧，让我们看看他，
好吗？

186
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,715
You know, Mrs Pumphrey,
the behaviour you're describing,

186
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,715
你知道，Pumphrey 夫人，
你所描述的行为，

187
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,280
is perfectly normal.

187
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,280
完全正常。

188
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,206
Tricki's a healthy animal
in the prime of life.

188
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,206
特里奇是一个
处于壮年期的健康动物。

189
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:03,942
And, as such, he's experiencing
some very natural...urges.

189
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:03,942
而且，因此，他正在经历
一些非常自然的......冲动。

190
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:06,871
Yes, but he's just a baby!

190
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:06,871
是的，但他只是个婴儿！

191
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,921
He's never shown the slightest bit
of interest in...

191
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:09,921
他
对……从来没有表现出丝毫的兴趣。

192
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:13,774
..that sort of thing.

192
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:13,774
..诸如此类的事情。

193
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,981
Well, it's a testament to the
excellent level of care

193
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,981
嗯，这证明了
出色的护理水平

194
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:19,552
he's been receiving. His weight's
gone down, his exercise has gone up.

194
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:19,552
他一直在接收。他的体重减轻
了，运动量增加了。

195
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:23,285
He's obviously feeling a great
deal livelier in every department.

195
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:23,285
显然，他
在每个部门都感觉更加活跃。

196
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:27,097
You know, Francois did say
that on one of their outings,

196
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:27,097
你知道，弗朗索瓦
在他们的一次郊游中确实说过，

197
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:30,428
he seemed intent on getting
into Mr Handshaw's yard.

197
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:30,428
他似乎
很想进入汉德肖先生的院子。

198
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:32,796
And does Mr Handshaw own
a dog at all?

198
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:32,796
Handshaw 先生到底
有没有养狗？

199
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,043
Oh, yes, a terrier.

199
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,043
哦，是的，一只小猎犬。

200
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:37,892
Named Bella, I believe.

200
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:37,892
我相信名叫贝拉。

201
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,260
Well, that would certainly explain
it.

201
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,260
嗯，这当然可以解释
它。

202
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,828
Less lethargic, more lothario.

202
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,828
不那么昏昏欲睡，更加乐于助人。

203
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,397
So what can be done
to discourage it?

203
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,397
那么可以做些什么
来阻止它呢？

204
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:49,811
I'm afraid the heart wants
what it wants,

204
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:49,811
恐怕心想要
什么，

205
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,503
which, in Tricki's case,
would seem to be Bella. Oh, dear.

205
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,503
在 Tricki 的情况下，
这似乎是 Bella。哦亲爱的。

206
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:55,991
There is one effective
course of action.

206
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:55,991
有一种有效
的行动方案。

207
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,917
It's a fairly simple procedure...

207
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,917
这是一个相当简单的程序...

208
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,606
Oh, no, no, no, no, Mr Farnon, no.

208
00:12:57,917 --> 00:13:00,606
哦，不，不，不，不，法农先生，不。

209
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:05,462
Can't you just give him
a calming draught of some sort?

209
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:05,462
你就不能给他
一些平静的草稿吗？

210
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:09,274
I'm sorry, Mrs Pumphrey.
He'll have to be fixed.

210
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:09,274
对不起，庞弗里夫人。
他必须得到修复。

211
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:13,609
If not, Tricki will simply continue
his pursuit until he succeeds.

211
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:13,609
如果没有，特里奇只会继续
他的追求，直到他成功。

212
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,264
HE WHINES SOFTLY

212
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,264
他轻声呜咽

213
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:32,952
Hello, James.
Hello, Jenny. Hello, Scruff.

213
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:32,952
你好，詹姆斯。
你好，珍妮。你好，斯克鲁夫。

214
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:35,400
Wait till you see what
Hugh Hulton's brought us.

214
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:35,400
等你看看
休·赫尔顿给我们带来了什么。

215
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,138
Have you ever seen anything like it?

215
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,138
你见过类似的东西吗？

216
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:43,506
And he'll be worth
a fortune in stud fees.

216
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:43,506
而且他
在种马费上会值一大笔钱。

217
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:46,676
But Hugh won't accept a penny
for him, says it's an apology

217
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:46,676
但休不会
为他接受一分钱，说这是道歉

218
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:49,285
because he wants to move forward
with a clean slate.

218
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:49,285
因为他想
白手起家。

219
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,415
Jenny, run and put the kettle on.

219
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:52,415
珍妮，快跑，把水壶放上去。

220
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,983
Dad'll be wanting a brew
and I'm sure James'd like one.

220
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,983
爸爸会想要一杯啤酒
，我敢肯定詹姆斯会想要一杯。

221
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:56,027
Fine.

221
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:56,027
美好的。

222
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,200
A pedigree bull.

222
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,200
一头纯种公牛。

223
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,368
Quite the gift. I know.

223
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,368
相当的礼物。我知道。

224
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:04,133
It were the last thing we expected.

224
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:04,133
这是我们所期望的最后一件事。

225
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,979
We haven't said we'll take him yet.

225
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,979
我们还没有说要带走他。

226
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,187
Dad thinks it's far too much,
but even so...

226
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,187
爸爸认为这太过分了，
但即便如此......

227
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,594
And there you were, worried he might
not even renew the lease.

227
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,594
你在那里，担心他
甚至可能不会续签租约。

228
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:12,280
I know, that's all sorted now too.

228
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:12,280
我知道，现在这一切也都已经解决了。

229
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,089
He's even added mine and Jenny's
names, so it'll be ours to inherit.

229
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,089
他甚至还加上了我和珍妮的
名字，所以继承权是我们的。

230
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,340
Right. That's very decent of him.

230
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,340
对。这对他来说是非常体面的。

231
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,346
Now, then...

231
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,346
接着...

232
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:21,871
Mr Alderson.

232
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:21,871
奥尔德森先生。

233
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:23,597
What do you reckon?

233
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:23,597
你怎么看？

234
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,443
He's a fine specimen.

234
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,443
他是一个很好的标本。

235
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:26,566
He is that.

235
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:26,566
他就是那个。

236
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:31,021
Any luck with Reg Dutton, dad?
Nah, he's still over in Listondale.

236
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:31,021
爸爸，Reg Dutton 好运吗？
不，他还在利斯顿代尔。

237
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:34,111
Dad's a player down for match
on Sunday. Oh, yes?

237
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:34,111
爸爸是
周日参加比赛的球员。哦是的？

238
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,439
And with Hugh back, they'll be
really up against it.

238
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,439
随着休的回归，他们将
真正反对。

239
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,766
Hugh's on the opposing team?
He's captain.

239
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,766
休在对方球队？
他是船长。

240
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:42,619
Not to mention the star player. He's
the main reason they always win.

240
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:42,619
更不用说明星球员了。他是
他们总是获胜的主要原因。

241
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:44,946
Er, not always.

241
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:44,946
呃，并非总是如此。

242
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:48,277
Though Hugh is a good bowler,
there's no denying it.

242
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:48,277
尽管休是一名出色的投球手，
但不可否认。

243
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:49,642
You know, Mr Alderson,

243
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:49,642
你知道，奥尔德森先生，

244
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,608
if you need an extra man,
I'd be happy to help out.

244
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,608
如果你需要一个额外的人，
我很乐意帮忙。

245
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,053
I didn't know you played.

245
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,053
我不知道你玩过。

246
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:55,742
Yes, well, now and again... Oh, aye.

246
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:55,742
是的，嗯，时不时……哦，是的。

247
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,949
You reckon you're up to it,
do you, lad?

247
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,949
你认为你能
胜任，是吗，小伙子？

248
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:59,273
Absolutely.

248
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:59,273
绝对地。

249
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:01,801
Right.

249
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:01,801
对。

250
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,845
You're in.

250
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,845
你在。

251
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:10,269
I'm really not much of a cricketer,

251
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:10,269
我真的不是一个板球运动员，

252
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:12,556
but I guess
if it's just a friendly match,

252
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:12,556
但我想
如果这只是一场友谊赛

253
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,961
it's not too much to worry about.

253
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,961
不用太担心。

254
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:16,489
Friendly?

254
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:16,489
友好的？

255
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,546
James, I would not be exaggerating
to say that this is the most

255
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,546
詹姆斯，我不会夸张
地说这是最

256
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,756
important game in the
cricketing calendar.

256
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,756
板球日历上的重要比赛。

257
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:27,926
Once a year, the Darrowby 11
goes up against the might

257
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:27,926
一年一次，达罗比 11 逆势
而上

258
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:32,180
of Hulton Hall's invited gentlemen,
playing for the honour of Darrowby.

258
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:32,180
Hulton Hall 邀请的绅士们，
为 Darrowby 的荣誉而战。

259
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,588
And get annihilated.
That's hardly the point.

259
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,588
并被歼灭。
这不是重点。

260
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:36,755
It's really quite the event, James.

260
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:36,755
詹姆斯，这真的很重要。

261
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,805
Mrs Pumphrey holds it on her own
private ground.

261
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,805
Pumphrey 夫人在她自己的
私人土地上持有它。

262
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,611
Sorry, she has a cricket pitch?

262
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,611
抱歉，她有板球场？

263
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,377
Ground, yes, down beyond
the orchard.

263
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,377
地面，是的，
在果园外。

264
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,584
The old dear's
completely cricket-mad.

264
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,584
老亲爱的
完全板球疯狂。

265
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,112
So, when you say you're
"not much of a cricketer"...?

265
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,112
所以，当你说你
“不是一个板球运动员”时......？

266
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,758
Well, football's more my game.

266
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,758
嗯，足球更像是我的游戏。

267
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:53,811
But you have played?
Once or twice, probably just once.

267
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:53,811
但是你玩过吗？
一次或两次，可能只有一次。

268
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,577
Oh, dear.

268
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:55,577
哦亲爱的。

269
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,426
Well, I had no idea it was so
important.

269
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,426
好吧，我不知道它如此
重要。

270
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,392
Oh, I'd say it's important!

270
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:00,392
哦，我会说这很重要！

271
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,880
For a Yorkshireman,
it goes King, God, Cricket.

271
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,880
对于约克郡人来说，
它是国王，上帝，板球。

272
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,526
I mean, if you get this wrong,

272
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,526
我的意思是，如果你弄错了，

273
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:07,375
they'll string you up in the town
square. Oh, fiddlesticks!

273
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:07,375
他们会在城镇
广场把你绑起来。哦，小提琴手！

274
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,144
James is fast and he's fit.
All right, it's not his game,

274
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,144
詹姆斯速度很快，而且他很健康。
好吧，这不是他的游戏，

275
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,672
but with a bit of coaching,
he'll do perfectly well.

275
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,672
但
只要稍加指导，他就会做得很好。

276
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,762
Quite right. We'll soon whip you
into shape, lad.

276
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,762
非常正确。我们很快就会让你
恢复体型，小伙子。

277
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:17,328
So, we've a day and a half.

277
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:17,328
所以，我们有一天半的时间。

278
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:19,775
That's what, 14, 15 hours of
sunlight?

278
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:19,775
那是什么，14、15个小时的
阳光？

279
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,341
Now, when you played before,

279
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,341
现在，当你以前玩的时候，

280
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:24,150
would you say you were more of a
batsman or a bowler?

280
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:24,150
你会说你更像是
击球手还是投球手？

281
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,875
Well, neither really.

281
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,875
嗯，也不是。

282
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,123
It was on the beach at Troon and it
was probably more what

282
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,123
它在特伦的海滩上，
可能更重要

283
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:30,771
you would call French cricket.
COLLECTIVE INHALE

283
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:30,771
你会称之为法国板球。
集体吸气

284
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:32,657
But it can't be any tougher
than football.

284
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:32,657
但它不可能
比足球更难。

285
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,544
At least in cricket,
no-one tackles you.

285
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,544
至少在板球比赛中，
没有人会对付你。

286
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:37,313
You haven't had a cricket ball
coming at you at 80mph.

286
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:37,313
您还没有
以 80 英里/小时的速度向您扑来板球。

287
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:39,720
Seriously, James, one of those could
kill you.

287
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:39,720
说真的，詹姆斯，其中一个可能会
杀了你。

288
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:42,891
Right, follow me.

288
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:42,891
对了，跟我来。

289
00:16:57,418 --> 00:17:01,351
Jess, come on, give that,
the boys need it for the cricket.

289
00:16:57,418 --> 00:17:01,351
Jess，来吧，给那个，
男孩们需要它来打板球。

290
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:03,518
Thank you. Right, come on.

290
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:03,518
谢谢你。对了，来吧。

291
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,163
Right, James. Take your guard.

291
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,163
对，詹姆斯。做好防护。

292
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:08,213
Remember, middle and leg,
head over the ball, straight back.

292
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:08,213
记住，中间和腿，
头在球上，向后挺直。

293
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,059
Weight on the front foot...

293
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:10,059
前脚的重量...

294
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,226
And nice easy lob...

294
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,226
和漂亮的轻松吊球...

295
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,360
You need to maintain your guard.

295
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,360
你需要保持警惕。

296
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,089
How's he getting on? Try again...

296
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,089
他过得怎么样？再试一次...

297
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,855
You could give your brother a hand.

297
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,855
你可以帮助你的兄弟。

298
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:23,423
Yes, and he could apologise
for treating me like a fool.

298
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:23,423
是的，他可以
为把我当傻子而道歉。

299
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:26,031
But I don't see that happening any
time soon either. And...

299
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:26,031
但我也认为这种情况不会
很快发生。和...

300
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:30,325
James, please, try to concentrate!
I...!

300
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:30,325
詹姆斯，请尽量集中注意力！
一世...！

301
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:35,904
Right, once more, take your guard,
middle and leg...

301
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:35,904
对了，再一次保护好你的
中间和腿……

302
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:38,392
Oh, for the love of God.
James, pass it here.

302
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:38,392
哦，为了上帝的爱。
詹姆斯，把它传到这里。

303
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,689
Right, don't even think about
hitting it,

303
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,689
对了，别想着
打它，

304
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,615
just think about blocking it.
Blocking it?

304
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,615
只要考虑阻止它。
挡住了吗？

305
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:48,946
You just need to get behind the ball
and stop it, all right? Come on.

305
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:48,946
你只需要在球后面
停下来，好吗？来吧。

306
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:59,099
As long as it doesn't hit your leg
or the wicket, you'll stay in.

306
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:59,099
只要它没有碰到你的腿
或检票口，你就会留在里面。

307
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,306
Well, there's a little more to it,
than that...

307
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,306
嗯，还有更多的东西，除此之外
......

308
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:04,116
No, there isn't, not for James. But,
as ever, you're making everything

308
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:04,116
不，没有，不是为了詹姆斯。但是，
一如既往，你正在创造一切

309
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,724
10,000 times more complicated than
it has to be...

309
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,724
比
它必须的复杂10,000倍......

310
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:08,530
He needs to know what
he should be doing...

310
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:08,530
他需要知道
他应该做什么……

311
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,978
No, he needs you to stop confusing
him with pointless stuff.

311
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,978
不，他需要你停止
用毫无意义的东西迷惑他。

312
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:13,707
Just let the man breathe and he'll
work it out for himself.

312
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:13,707
只要让这个人喘口气，他就会
自己解决。

313
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:15,713
James. Here, give it a try.

313
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:15,713
詹姆士。来，试一试。

314
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,536
Right, that's it, just relax,
all you need to do is block it.

314
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,536
对，就是这样，放轻松，
你需要做的就是阻止它。

315
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:29,839
It worked! Course it did.

315
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:29,839
有效！当然做到了。

316
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:33,331
Now, just remember
the cardinal rule -

316
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:33,331
现在，只要记住
基本规则——

317
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,816
never step away from your stumps.

317
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,816
永远不要离开你的树桩。

318
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:38,267
Well, at least he's making himself
useful. Despite the injured air.

318
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:38,267
好吧，至少他让自己变得
有用了。尽管受伤的空气。

319
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:41,477
He feels you still owe him
an apology. Utter nonsense.

319
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:41,477
他觉得你还欠他
一个道歉。胡说八道。

320
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:42,521
PHONE RINGS

320
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:42,521
电话铃声

321
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,815
So, you played a lot of cricket
at school, then, did you, Triss?

321
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,815
所以，你
在学校打了很多板球，那么，你呢，特莉丝？

322
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,300
Yes, fair bit.

322
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,300
是的，公平一点。

323
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,871
Captain of the first 11,
weren't you? Darrowby, 2-2-9-7.

323
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,871
前11的队长，
不是吗？达罗比，2-2-9-7。

324
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:54,319
Yes, we had a pretty strong
team at the prep school.

324
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:54,319
是的，我们
在预科学校有一支非常强大的团队。

325
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,128
Even won the inter-school cup
three years in a row.

325
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,128
甚至连续
三年获得校际杯冠军。

326
00:18:57,128 --> 00:18:58,734
I didn't know that.

326
00:18:57,128 --> 00:18:58,734
我不知道。

327
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:02,506
No? We actually set a new
record for the Under 12s.

327
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:02,506
不？实际上，我们
为 12 岁以下儿童创造了新记录。

328
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:04,392
The old man came to every match.

328
00:19:02,506 --> 00:19:04,392
老头子每场比赛都来。

329
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:06,920
Pa used to watch you play?

329
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:06,920
爸以前看你打球？

330
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,452
He'd drive up in the mornings
and we'd make a day of it.

330
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,452
他会在早上开车
，我们会度过一天。

331
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:12,218
You know how he loved cricket. Yes.

331
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:12,218
你知道他有多喜欢板球。是的。

332
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:14,545
Yes, I suppose he did.

332
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:14,545
是的，我想他做到了。

333
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:19,401
Mr Farnon, Mrs Pumphrey.

333
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:19,401
法农先生，普弗里太太。

334
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:22,130
She says she's in dire
need of your assistance.

334
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:22,130
她说她非常
需要你的帮助。

335
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,745
Mrs Pumphrey, what can I do for you?

335
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,745
Pumphrey 夫人，我能为您做什么？

336
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:30,196
The workmen were putting up the
tea tent for tomorrow, you see,

336
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:30,196
工人们正在
搭起明天的茶帐，你看，

337
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:32,604
and Francois was clearly distracted.

337
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:32,604
弗朗索瓦显然心烦意乱。

338
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:38,624
And, erm, poor Tricki, I mean,
he dashed through the main gate

338
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:38,624
而且，呃，可怜的特里奇，我是说，
他冲进了大门

339
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:41,955
and just ran and ran...
So Tricki is missing?

339
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:41,955
就跑
啊跑...所以特里奇失踪了？

340
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:43,841
Foot to the bridge of the ball,
James!

340
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:43,841
脚到球桥，
詹姆斯！

341
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,650
Well, no, not, not exactly.
He was, erm...

341
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,650
嗯，不，不，不完全是。
他是，呃...

342
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,222
He was heading in the
direction of Mr Handshaw's yard.

342
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,222
他正朝着
汉德肖先生的院子走去。

343
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,475
Ah. And I really can't ask
Francois... No, of course.

343
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,475
啊。我真的不能问
弗朗索瓦……不，当然。

344
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:57,124
Er, leave...leave it with me,
Mrs Pumphrey,

344
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:57,124
呃，离开……
交给我，Pumphrey 夫人，

345
00:19:57,124 --> 00:19:59,050
you've nothing to worry about.

345
00:19:57,124 --> 00:19:59,050
你没有什么可担心的。

346
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,816
Oh, thank you, thank you!

346
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,816
哦，谢谢，谢谢！

347
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:03,545
Mr Farnon, when you see Tricki,

347
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:03,545
法农先生，当你看到特里奇时，

348
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:06,996
could you pretend that you
just happened to be passing?

348
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:06,996
你能假装
刚好路过吗？

349
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:10,969
He's terribly private, I would
hate for him to be embarrassed.

349
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:10,969
他非常私密，我不想
让他感到尴尬。

350
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:13,417
I understand. Of course.

350
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:13,417
我明白。当然。

351
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,079
Aye, he's a determined
little bugger.

351
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,079
是的，他是一个坚定的
小家伙。

352
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,366
Well, as I say, Mrs Pumphrey
did want me to pass on

352
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,366
好吧，正如我所说，Pumphrey 夫人
确实希望我继续

353
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:23,931
her sincere apologies. Not to worry.

353
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:23,931
她真诚的道歉。不要担心。

354
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,456
It's not like he's some stray.

354
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,456
他不像是个流浪者。

355
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,790
A litter or two of pups wouldn't
be the end of the world.

355
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,790
一两窝幼崽不会
是世界末日。

356
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,516
Come on, then, young Trickiwoo,

356
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,516
来吧，年轻的特里奇乌，

357
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:34,165
let's put you back where you belong,
shall we?

357
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:34,165
让我们把你放回属于你的地方，
好吗？

358
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,971
See you at the match tomorrow,
Mr Handshaw.

358
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:35,971
汉德肖先生，明天比赛见。

359
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:39,863
Your brother still not playing? I'm
afraid not. That's a damned shame.

359
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:39,863
你哥还不玩？我
恐怕没有。那真是该死的耻辱。

360
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,830
Might've given us a fighting chance.

360
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,830
可能给了我们一个战斗的机会。

361
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,090
Well, now he's been there once,

361
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,090
嗯，现在他去过那里一次，

362
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,297
he'll be much more inclined
to visit again.

362
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,297
他会更愿意
再次访问。

363
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,190
Right, seems we have no choice.

363
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,190
对，看来我们别无选择。

364
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,916
It's a very simple procedure.

364
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,916
这是一个非常简单的程序。

365
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,845
In fact, I should be able to fit
him in on Monday. That soon?

365
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,845
事实上，
周一我应该能让他适应。这么快？

366
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,059
Well, all right.
If we must, we must.

366
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,059
好吧，好吧。
如果我们必须，我们必须。

367
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,828
But until then, you really need to
keep him on a lead.

367
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,828
但在那之前，你真的需要
让他保持领先。

368
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:09,239
Oh, Tricki.

368
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:09,239
哦，特里奇。

369
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:12,209
Will you ever forgive me?

369
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:12,209
你会原谅我吗？

370
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:17,586
All set for match tomorrow, I hope?

370
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:17,586
一切都准备好明天比赛，我希望？

371
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:20,516
Absolutely. Raring to go!
Oh, that's the spirit.

371
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:20,516
绝对地。迫不及待要去了！
哦，这就是精神。

372
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:24,248
And with James playing too, I really
think this might be your year.

372
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:24,248
有了詹姆斯也打球，我真的
认为这可能是你的一年。

373
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:54,507
I think we're all here.

373
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:54,507
我想我们都在这里。

374
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:58,118
Ladies and gentlemen, It's my very
great pleasure to welcome you all

374
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:58,118
女士们，先生们，我很
高兴欢迎大家

375
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:03,536
to Pumphrey Manor for this year's
encounter between The Darrowby 11

375
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:03,536
到 Pumphrey Manor 参加今年
与 The Darrowby 11的相遇

376
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:06,024
and the Hulton Hall Chaps.

376
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:06,024
和 Hulton Hall Chaps。

377
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,188
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

377
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,188
欢呼与掌声

378
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:13,127
Has anyone seen Mr Rudd?

378
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:13,127
有人见过陆先生吗？

379
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:23,280
We'll be playing a timed game, with
the last 20 overs from five o'clock.

379
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:23,280
我们将进行一场计时比赛，
从五点开始进行最后 20 场比赛。

380
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,929
And, erm, I know we're all looking
forward to seeing some

380
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,929
而且，嗯，我知道我们都期待
看到一些

381
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,294
excellent cricket.

381
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,294
优秀的板球。

382
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:28,497
TRICKI YAPS

382
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:28,497
特里奇·雅普斯

383
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:31,146
CROWD CHUCKLES
So, erm, wi...

383
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:31,146
人群咯咯笑
所以，呃，...

384
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:33,714
Without further ado, Mr Chapman?
Yeah?

384
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:33,714
不用多说，查普曼先生？
是的？

385
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:35,882
If you would do the honours.

385
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:35,882
如果你会做荣誉。

386
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:37,527
Certainly.

386
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:37,527
当然。

387
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,858
Well gentlemen, if you're ready,
will you two captains

387
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,858
先生们，如果你们准备好了，
你们两位船长好吗？

388
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:44,148
accompany me to the
crease with the coin toss, please?

388
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:44,148
陪我一起
抛硬币，好吗？

389
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:45,714
Thank you. Mr Alderson...

389
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:45,714
谢谢你。奥尔德森先生...

390
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,011
Mr Alderson. Young Rudds,
where's your father?

390
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,011
奥尔德森先生。年轻的路德斯，
你爸爸呢？

391
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:52,977
He can't come, Mr Alderson,
the sheep got out

391
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:52,977
他不能来，奥尔德森先生，
羊跑了

392
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:55,225
and he needs to round 'em up.
You're kidding me?

392
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:55,225
他需要四舍五入。
你在逗我吗？

393
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:58,596
No, we're not. We're not.
You're not.

393
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:58,596
没有，我们没有。不是。
你不。

394
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:00,201
So he's not coming?

394
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:00,201
所以他不来？

395
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:02,247
So we're a player short.

395
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:02,247
所以我们是一名球员。

396
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,578
Well, go on. You can't let them
go out wi' ten men.

396
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,578
好吧，继续。你不能让他们
带着十个人出去。

397
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:13,605
I can always play, Mr Alderson,
if that would be any help?

397
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:13,605
我总是可以玩，奥尔德森先生，
如果这有什么帮助吗？

398
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,772
Help? Yeah, that'd be a big help.

398
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,772
帮助？是的，那会有很大帮助。

399
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,822
Shame you didn't offer before.

399
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,822
可惜你之前没有提供。

400
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:20,828
Go and help your dad look for them
sheep.

400
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:20,828
去帮你爸爸找
羊。

401
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:24,480
Welcome to the team.

401
00:23:22,594 --> 00:23:24,480
欢迎加入我们。

402
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,490
Yes, thanks.
THEY LAUGH

402
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,490
是啊谢谢。
他们笑了

403
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:32,506
Afternoon.

403
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:32,506
下午。

404
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,532
Mr Hulton, would you like to make
the call? Heads.

404
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,532
Hulton 先生，您要打个
电话吗？头。

405
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,629
We're bowling, lads.

405
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:45,629
我们在打保龄球，伙计们。

406
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:46,672
We're batting.

406
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:46,672
我们在击球。

407
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:52,050
Well, we've got to do it sometime.
I'd rather do it second, but...

407
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:52,050
好吧，我们必须在某个时候这样做。
我宁愿做第二件事，但是...

408
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:56,785
Herriot.

408
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:56,785
赫里奥特。

409
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,233
Hugh.

409
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,233
休。

410
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,975
Right, remember what
we did last year?

410
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,975
对了，还记得
我们去年做了什么吗？

411
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:12,195
Come on, boys, stay alert.

411
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:12,195
来吧，孩子们，保持警惕。

412
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,128
Go on, dad.

412
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,128
继续，爸爸。

413
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:23,914
Look lively, Herriot.

413
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:23,914
看起来很活泼，赫里奥特。

414
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:25,760
Come on, lads!

414
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:25,760
来吧，伙计们！

415
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,452
OK, play.

415
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,452
好，玩。

416
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:38,000
Knock to it, lads, come on!
Unlucky, unlucky!

416
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:38,000
敲门，小伙子们，来吧！
倒霉，倒霉！

417
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:44,260
Good shot...

417
00:24:42,735 --> 00:24:44,260
好球...

418
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,303
Four!

418
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,303
四个！

419
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,360
Excellent opener, Mr Hulton.

419
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,360
优秀的开场白，赫尔顿先生。

420
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:57,303
Looks like Mr Hulton means business.

420
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:57,303
看起来 Hulton 先生是认真的。

421
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:01,075
Herriot.

421
00:24:59,911 --> 00:25:01,075
赫里奥特。

422
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,666
Oh, good shot!

422
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,666
哦，拍得好！

423
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,957
Yours, Herriot!

423
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,957
你的，赫里奥特！

424
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:15,361
Get behind it.

424
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:15,361
落后于它。

425
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:16,927
Come on, James!
Unlucky.

425
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:16,927
加油，詹姆斯！
倒霉。

426
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,147
Just a single. Keepers' end.

426
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,147
只是一个。守门员的结局。

427
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,326
That's Hulton's 50.

427
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,326
那是赫尔顿的 50 岁。

428
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,261
Herriot.

428
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,261
赫里奥特。

429
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:00,589
James! Ball!
Come on, lad!

429
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:00,589
詹姆士！球！
来吧，小伙子！

430
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:07,371
Eye on the ball, Mr Herriot.

430
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:07,371
盯着球看，赫里奥特先生。

431
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:17,765
123...

431
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:17,765
123...

432
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:19,129
..for no wickets.

432
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:19,129
..因为没有小门。

433
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:25,229
Not out.

433
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:25,229
不出来。

434
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:26,273
Chin up.

434
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:26,273
振奋起来。

435
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,603
Unlucky. Next time, lads.

435
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,603
倒霉。下次，伙计们。

436
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:34,138
James is looking a bit hot.

436
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:34,138
詹姆斯看起来有点热。

437
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:37,630
Hugh's giving him
a right runaround.

437
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:37,630
休给了他
一个正确的选择。

438
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,957
Helen.

438
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,957
海伦。

439
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:42,164
How are you?
Hello, Margot.

439
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:42,164
你好吗？
你好，玛戈。

440
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,974
Yeah, I'm fine thank you.
This is my sister, Jenny.

440
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:44,974
是的，我很好，谢谢。
这是我的妹妹，珍妮。

441
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:46,619
Hello.

441
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:46,619
你好。

442
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:49,268
Are you enjoying the match?

442
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:49,268
你享受比赛吗？

443
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:52,759
I will once we start getting
some wickets.

443
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:52,759
一旦我们开始获得
一些小门，我就会。

444
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,244
Oh, yes, of course.

444
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,244
哦，是的，当然。

445
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:05,400
Anyway, I'm sure I'll see
you in the tea tent.

445
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:05,400
不管怎样，我相信我会
在茶帐里见到你的。

446
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:10,778
What was all that about?

446
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:10,778
那是怎么回事？

447
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:18,081
Let's be having a wicket, Siegfried.

447
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:18,081
齐格弗里德，让我们有一个检票口。

448
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:22,416
Hello there.
Hello.

448
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:22,416
你好呀。
你好。

449
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,342
I noticed you were rather
tied to your post

449
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,342
我注意到你
对你的帖子很感兴趣

450
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,549
and thought you might
be in need of refreshment.

450
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,549
并认为您可能
需要提神。

451
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,716
Oh, that's very kind of you.

451
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,716
哦，你真是太好了。

452
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:30,642
Thank you.

452
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:30,642
谢谢你。

453
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:33,773
Your Mr Farnon doesn't seem to be
having much luck.

453
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:33,773
你的法农先生似乎
不太走运。

454
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:36,542
Trouble is, he's overpitching.

454
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:36,542
问题是，他太调皮了。

455
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:43,444
When you say "overpitching"?

455
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:43,444
当你说“过分”？

456
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:47,176
He's landing the ball too
close to the batsman,

456
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:47,176
他的球
离击球手太近了，

457
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:49,343
making it easier to drive.

457
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:49,343
使其更容易驾驶。

458
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:52,153
Go on, James.

458
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:52,153
继续，詹姆斯。

459
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:56,607
He's making it harder for the
fielders.

459
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:56,607
他让
外野手更难了。

460
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:58,573
So he does.

460
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:58,573
所以他会。

461
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:06,118
Are you all right, there, Herriot?

461
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:06,118
你没事吧，赫里奥特？

462
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,202
Fine, thanks.

462
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,202
很好，谢谢。

463
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:10,974
Well,
you can't blame the bull this time.

463
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:10,974
好吧，
这次你不能责怪公牛。

464
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,338
HE FEIGNS LAUGHTER

464
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,338
他假装在笑

465
00:28:14,947 --> 00:28:18,398
Would you mind changing that to 138?

465
00:28:14,947 --> 00:28:18,398
你介意把它改成 138 吗？

466
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,949
Mr Chapman. Mm?

466
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,949
查普曼先生。毫米？

467
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:29,595
I think that's enough.

467
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:29,595
我认为这就够了。

468
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:30,999
Come on, Harry.

468
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:30,999
来吧，哈利。

469
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:38,744
Ah, and that's the declaration.

469
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:38,744
啊，这就是宣言。

470
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:40,229
Tea, everyone!

470
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:40,229
茶，大家！

471
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:44,082
What's happening?

471
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:44,082
发生了什么？

472
00:28:44,082 --> 00:28:47,413
Hulton thinks he's got enough runs
to win so he's declared.

472
00:28:44,082 --> 00:28:47,413
Hulton 认为他有足够的得分
来获胜，所以他宣布了。

473
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:48,938
He's stopping.

473
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:48,938
他要停下来了。

474
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:51,225
Well, that's good news for us,
isn't it? Aye.

474
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:51,225
嗯，这对我们来说
是个好消息，不是吗？是的。

475
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:52,349
If you like charity.

475
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:52,349
如果你喜欢慈善。

476
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:53,994
I could certainly use a cup of tea.

476
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:53,994
我当然可以用一杯茶。

477
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:55,880
Well, enjoy it while you can.

477
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:55,880
好吧，尽情享受吧。

478
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,405
We're batting next.

478
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,405
我们接下来要击球了。

479
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:58,730
And it won't be pretty.

479
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:58,730
而且不会很漂亮。

480
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,197
Pork pie, you love that.

480
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,197
猪肉馅饼，你喜欢那个。

481
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:10,207
Oh, yum-yum-yum. No?

481
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:10,207
哦，嗯，​​嗯，嗯。不？

482
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:15,063
Or how about a tiny piece of
iced bun?

482
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:15,063
或者一小
块冰面包怎么样？

483
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,227
LOW GROWL

483
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,227
低吼

484
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:18,073
Oh! Oh, Mr Farnon.

484
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:18,073
哦！哦，法农先生。

485
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:19,838
I hope you're not too disheartened.

485
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:19,838
我希望你不要太沮丧。

486
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,363
Oh, not at all.

486
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,363
哦，一点也不。

487
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:24,172
We've got a lot of strength
in our batting. That's the spirit.

487
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:24,172
我们
的击球能力很强。就是那种精神。

488
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:26,741
And, you have your secret weapon.

488
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:26,741
而且，你有你的秘密武器。

489
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:29,751
Your brother, of course.

489
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:29,751
当然是你的兄弟。

490
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,794
Yes.

490
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,794
是的。

491
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:33,322
He opened quite gloriously
last year.

491
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:33,322
他
去年开张得非常光彩。

492
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:35,088
He did do very well.

492
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:35,088
他做得很好。

493
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:37,937
Tricki, please.

493
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:37,937
特里奇，请。

494
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:40,104
He simply hates this horrid lead.

494
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:40,104
他只是讨厌这个可怕的领导。

495
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:41,710
Well, it's only till the operation.

495
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:41,710
嗯，这只是直到手术。

496
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,355
And what then?

496
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,355
然后呢？

497
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:45,602
Can you promise me

497
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:45,602
你能答应我吗

498
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:50,900
he'll still be my Tricki once he's
been emasculated?

498
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:50,900
一旦他
被阉割了，他还是我的特里奇吗？

499
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,230
Some dogs do present a slight
change in temperament.

499
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,230
有些狗的
性情确实会略有变化。

500
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,719
Yes, that's what I feared.

500
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,719
是的，这就是我害怕的。

501
00:29:56,719 --> 00:30:00,732
It just feels too cruel.

501
00:29:56,719 --> 00:30:00,732
只是觉得太残忍了。

502
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,343
Why shouldn't he be allowed to
express his true self

502
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,343
为什么不应该让他
表达真实的自己

503
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:08,116
and experience life to the full?

503
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:08,116
并充分体验生活？

504
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,901
And if Mr Handshaw were open to
an arrangement...

504
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,901
如果 Handshaw 先生愿意接受
安排......

505
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,469
Well,
he certainly gave that impression.

505
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,469
嗯，
他确实给人这种印象。

506
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:20,877
Well, what would you do, Mr Farnon?

506
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:20,877
好吧，你会怎么做，法农先生？

507
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:28,984
Do you know what, Mrs Pumphrey?

507
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:28,984
你知道吗，庞弗里夫人？

508
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:31,793
If I were you,
I would forget the lead

508
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:31,793
如果我是你，
我会忘记主角

509
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:35,645
and just let Tricki do what
comes naturally.

509
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:35,645
就让特里奇做
自然而然的事情。

510
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:39,779
Life's just too short, isn't it?

510
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:39,779
生命太短暂了，不是吗？

511
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,745
I knew you would understand.

511
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,745
我知道你会明白的。

512
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,817
Hugh, could I speak to you for a
moment?

512
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,817
休，我能跟你说
一会儿吗？

513
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:05,463
Course.

513
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:05,463
课程。

514
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,192
I just want to say, how,
how sorry I am.

514
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,192
我只想说，
我多么，多么抱歉。

515
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,516
For everything that happened.

515
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,516
对于发生的一切。

516
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:11,282
That's water under the bridge.

516
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:11,282
那是桥下的水。

517
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:14,572
No, I know, but I've not had chance
to apologise properly.

517
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:14,572
不，我知道，但我没有机会
好好道歉。

518
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,616
In person.

518
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,616
亲自。

519
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,562
I never wanted to hurt you.

519
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,562
我从来不想伤害你。

520
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:27,655
We just weren't right for one
another.

520
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:27,655
我们只是不适合
彼此。

521
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,662
And I knew I wouldn't make
you happy.

521
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,662
我知道我不会让
你开心。

522
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:36,564
Well, I admit I...I was rather
devastated.

522
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:36,564
好吧，我承认我......我相当
沮丧。

523
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,263
But in a way,
once the worst has happened,

523
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,263
但在某种程度上，
一旦最糟糕的事情发生了，

524
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:45,634
it's actually rather freeing.

524
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:45,634
它实际上是相当自由的。

525
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:49,727
And I think part of me
always knew it wasn't right.

525
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:49,727
而且我认为我的一部分
总是知道这是不对的。

526
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:53,379
That we were good pals
and I know you were fond of me,

526
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:53,379
我们是好朋友
，我知道你喜欢我，

527
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:59,880
but...well, it was never a grand
passion, really, was it?

527
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:59,880
但是……嗯，这从来都不是一种盛大的
激情，真的，是吗？

528
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,445
Well, no.

528
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,445
嗯，不。

529
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:02,729
Maybe not.

529
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:02,729
也许不吧。

530
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:09,391
Maybe one day we can be pals again.

530
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:09,391
也许有一天我们可以再次成为好朋友。

531
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:10,635
I'd like that.

531
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:10,635
我愿意。

532
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,253
About the bull.

532
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,253
关于公牛。

533
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,387
It was such a generous
thing to do... Did I overstep?

533
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,387
这是
一件多么慷慨的事情……我是不是越界了？

534
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:22,594
Because that,
that really wasn't my intention.

534
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:22,594
因为那
真的不是我的本意。

535
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:25,564
And me Dad knows you meant well.
We both do.

535
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:25,564
我爸爸知道你的意思很好。
我们都这样做。

536
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:27,049
But we can't accept it.

536
00:32:25,564 --> 00:32:27,049
但我们不能接受。

537
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:28,694
Right.

537
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:28,694
对。

538
00:32:28,694 --> 00:32:30,058
Pay our own way.

538
00:32:28,694 --> 00:32:30,058
支付我们自己的方式。

539
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:32,065
Always have.

539
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:32,065
一直有。

540
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:34,673
And you've no reason to feel you
have to make amends.

540
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:34,673
而且你没有理由觉得你
必须做出补偿。

541
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,727
Didn't realise Herriot was
a cricketer.

541
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,727
没有意识到赫里奥特是
一名板球运动员。

542
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:40,292
Oh,
he stepped in at the last minute.

542
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:40,292
哦，
他在最后一刻介入了。

543
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,462
Ah, keen to impress the Captain,
no doubt.

543
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,462
啊，
毫无疑问，渴望给船长留下深刻印象。

544
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:48,358
We only started seeing each other
quite recently.

544
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:48,358
我们
最近才开始见面。

545
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,365
I mean,
there were nothing going on before.

545
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,365
我的意思是，
之前什么都没有发生。

546
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:53,455
Helen, really,
I'm just glad you're happy.

546
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:53,455
海伦，真的，
我很高兴你开心。

547
00:32:55,261 --> 00:32:57,468
Well, I'd better get
back to the others.

547
00:32:55,261 --> 00:32:57,468
好吧，我最好
回到其他人那里。

548
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:58,953
Discuss strategy and all that.

548
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:58,953
讨论战略等等。

549
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:12,075
Hello. Oh, there you are...

549
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:12,075
你好。哦，你在这儿...

550
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,002
I saw you chatting with Hugh.

550
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,002
我看到你在和休聊天。

551
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:15,567
Yeah. We had a really good talk.

551
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:15,567
是的。我们谈得真好。

552
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,092
I feel like we cleared the air.

552
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,092
我觉得我们净化了空气。

553
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:18,416
Right.

553
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:18,416
对。

554
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:20,784
What's wrong?

554
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:20,784
怎么了？

555
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:22,630
I just wondered why
he was kissing you.

555
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:22,630
我只是想知道
他为什么要吻你。

556
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,556
Kissing me?

556
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,556
亲我？

557
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:26,081
Oh, that were nothing.
Right.

557
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:26,081
哦，那没什么。
对。

558
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:29,091
He just wants to be friends.

558
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:29,091
他只想做朋友。

559
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,338
And he's given you a pedigree
bull to prove it.

559
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,338
他给了你一头纯种
公牛来证明这一点。

560
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,545
Yeah, well, I've said I'm not
accepting the bull.

560
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,545
是的，好吧，我说过我不
接受公牛。

561
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,910
You're not?

561
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,910
你不？

562
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,635
Course not.

562
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,635
当然不是。

563
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:39,164
It were a kind gesture,
but we're not in need of charity,

563
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:39,164
这是一种善意的姿态，
但我们不需要施舍，

564
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:41,130
however well meant.

564
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:41,130
不过好意。

565
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,695
Now, then Herriot.

565
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,695
现在，然后是赫里奥特。

566
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:45,625
I'll put you up to bat last with
you being a novice.

566
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:45,625
作为新手，我会让你坚持到最后。

567
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,069
Right.
Very good.

567
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,069
对。
非常好。

568
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:50,481
Yeah. Let's hope that Hugh takes it
easy with you.

568
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:50,481
是的。让我们希望 Hugh 能
轻松对待你。

569
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:57,182
Right, ladies and gentlemen, I think
we are ready to resume.

569
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:57,182
是的，女士们，先生们，我想
我们已经准备好重新开始了。

570
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,473
Hulton's looking deadly serious.

570
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,473
赫尔顿看起来非常严肃。

571
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,480
But then I suppose he's
a lot riding on this.

571
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,480
但后来我想他
很在意这个。

572
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,928
How d'you mean? Well, all those
months he spent in France,

572
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,928
你是什​​么意思？好吧，
他在法国度过的那几个月，

573
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,533
too embarrassed to show his face.

573
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,533
太不好意思露脸了。

574
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:09,101
He'll be wanting a win to
restore his dignity. Triss!

574
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:09,101
他会想要一场胜利来
恢复他的尊严。特莉丝！

575
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:37,514
Lovely shot, Tristan.

575
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:37,514
漂亮的镜头，特里斯坦。

576
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:38,838
Cracking shot, Tristan!

576
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:38,838
开枪，特里斯坦！

577
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,704
Go on, Triss.

577
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,704
继续，特莉丝。

578
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:59,024
Brilliant!

578
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:59,024
杰出的！

579
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:11,906
Again.

579
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:11,906
再次。

580
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:16,641
CHEERING

580
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:16,641
欢呼

581
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:17,886
GROANING

581
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:17,886
呻吟

582
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:33,376
Nicely done. Good running, lads.

582
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:33,376
做得很好。跑得好，伙计们。

583
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:34,580
Stay.

583
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:34,580
停留。

584
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,907
GROANING

584
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,907
呻吟

585
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:50,311
That's unlucky.

585
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:50,311
那是倒霉。

586
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,080
Now that's called a batting
collapse.

586
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,080
现在这被称为击球
崩溃。

587
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,090
It's more exciting than I'd
anticipated.

587
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,090
这比我
预期的更令人兴奋。

588
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,337
We'll make a cricket convert
of you yet.

588
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,337
我们会让你成为蟋蟀的转换
者。

589
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:07,206
You know, I walk Rock
down by Copley Brook most evenings.

589
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:07,206
你知道，
大多数晚上我都会在科普利溪边散步。

590
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,377
If you're ever out with Jess
and want a bit of company.

590
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,377
如果你曾经和 Jess 一起出去，
想要一点陪伴。

591
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:16,998
Well...perhaps we'll see you down
there.

591
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:16,998
好吧……也许我们会在
那里见到你。

592
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:21,252
Last over. Doubt you'll be needed.

592
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:21,252
最后结束。怀疑你会被需要。

593
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:24,463
They need to get two
wickets before you go in

593
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:24,463
在你进去之前，他们需要得到两个检票口

594
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,268
and Siegfried is looking strong.

594
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,268
齐格弗里德看起来很强壮。

595
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:35,178
Catch it. Yes!

595
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:35,178
抓住它。是的！

596
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:43,525
Just four balls to face, Henry.

596
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:43,525
只需要面对四个球，亨利。

597
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:48,300
Good luck, Henry.
Come on, Henry. Thanks, lads.

597
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:48,300
祝你好运，亨利。
来吧，亨利。谢谢，伙计们。

598
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,745
All the best, Henry.

598
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,745
一切顺利，亨利。

599
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:56,728
Play.

599
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:56,728
玩。

600
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:05,115
GASPS

600
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:05,115
气体安全保护系统

601
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:10,372
I spoke too soon.

601
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:10,372
我说得太快了。

602
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,867
Right, Herriot, get padded up.

602
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,867
对了，赫里奥特，收拾收拾。

603
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,673
Henry's retiring hurt.

603
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,673
亨利的退休受伤了。

604
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:19,081
There's three balls left till
the end of the game.

604
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:19,081
到
比赛结束还剩三个球。

605
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:22,131
If they don't get you out,
we'll draw.

605
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:22,131
如果他们不让你出去，
我们就抽签。

606
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:26,384
And that's as good as a win.
Just do what you can.

606
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:26,384
这和胜利一样好。
做你能做的。

607
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:37,099
All you have to do is stay in,
old chap.

607
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:37,099
你所要做的就是呆在里面，
老家伙。

608
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,624
Remember what we practised.

608
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:38,624
记住我们练习的内容。

609
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,393
Protect your wicket
and guard your stumps.

609
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,393
保护您的检票口
并保护您的树桩。

610
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:47,052
Middle leg.

610
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:47,052
中腿。

611
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,135
That'll do.

611
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,135
这样就行了。

612
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:50,864
Go on, lad.

612
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:50,864
加油，小伙子。

613
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,275
Three balls to come.

613
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,275
三个球来了。

614
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:00,576
GROANING AND MURMURING

614
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:00,576
呻吟和抱怨

615
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:06,555
Fine.

615
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:06,555
美好的。

616
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:08,281
You all right, Jim?

616
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:08,281
你还好吗，吉姆？

617
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:12,455
Well done, James.

617
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:12,455
干得好，詹姆斯。

618
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:26,862
Run.

618
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:26,862
跑。

619
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:31,918
It's gone for four.

619
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:31,918
四点没了。

620
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,376
Back this end, old chap.

620
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,376
回到这一点，老家伙。

621
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:48,813
Last ball of the match.

621
00:38:47,288 --> 00:38:48,813
比赛的最后一球。

622
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:51,341
Just block it again,
exactly the same as before,

622
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:51,341
再屏蔽一次，
和之前一模一样，

623
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,589
and Hugh'll be
crying into his beer tonight.

623
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,589
今晚休会在他的啤酒里哭。

624
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,435
Come on, Mr Herriot. Come on, James.

624
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,435
来吧，赫里奥特先生。来吧，詹姆斯。

625
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,125
Unlucky, batsman.

625
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,125
不幸的是，击球手。

626
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:15,696
Hard luck, lad.

626
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:15,696
运气不好，小伙子。

627
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,101
Thanks, Bert.

627
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,101
谢谢，伯特。

628
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:22,358
Funny that, almost looked like you
deliberately stepped

628
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:22,358
有趣的是，几乎看起来像你
故意踩

629
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:24,003
away from the wicket.

629
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:24,003
远离检票口。

630
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:25,448
Why ever would I do that?

630
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:25,448
我为什么要那样做？

631
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:27,776
I've absolutely no idea.

631
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:27,776
我完全不知道。

632
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:40,337
Hey. Bad luck, Mr Herriot.

632
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:40,337
嘿。运气不好，赫里奥特先生。

633
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,380
Nearly had a draw there.

633
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,380
那里差点有平局。

634
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,908
Aye, still, well played, lads.

634
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,908
是的，仍然，打得很好，小伙子们。

635
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,196
They were a tough side
and no mistake.

635
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,196
他们是强硬的一方
，没有错。

636
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:49,687
You carried your bat.

636
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:49,687
你带着你的蝙蝠。

637
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,092
Great achievement.

637
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,092
伟大的成就。

638
00:40:51,092 --> 00:40:52,416
Both of you.

638
00:40:51,092 --> 00:40:52,416
你们俩。

639
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,305
The old man would be proud.

639
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,305
老人会很自豪的。

640
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,730
That's, erm, very fine batting,
young Farnon.

640
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,730
那是，嗯，非常好的击球，
年轻的法农。

641
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:06,101
James didn't do too badly either.

641
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:06,101
詹姆斯的表现也不算差。

642
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:08,870
Till he lost his nerve.

642
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:08,870
直到他失去了理智。

643
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,993
Dad!

643
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,993
爸爸！

644
00:41:09,993 --> 00:41:11,839
Oh, well, I'm only saying it to him.

644
00:41:09,993 --> 00:41:11,839
哦，好吧，我只是对他说。

645
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,010
Good try, Uncle Herriot.

645
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,010
很好的尝试，赫里奥特叔叔。

646
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,979
Thank you, Mrs Pumphrey.

646
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,979
谢谢你，庞弗里夫人。

647
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:19,705
Well done, Triss.
Thanks, Helen.

647
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:19,705
干得好，特莉丝。
谢谢，海伦。

648
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:24,240
Well done.

648
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:24,240
做得好。

649
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,845
I don't think your dad's too happy.

649
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,845
我觉得你爸爸不太高兴。

650
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:27,370
Don't worry about him.

650
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:27,370
不用担心他。

651
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,741
James, I just wanted to say...

651
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,741
詹姆斯，我只想说……

652
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,788
..well played.

652
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:32,788
..打的好。

653
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:34,473
You too.

653
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:34,473
你也是。

654
00:41:34,473 --> 00:41:36,640
I suppose the best team won.

654
00:41:34,473 --> 00:41:36,640
我想最好的球队赢了。

655
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,968
Still, that took real grit.

655
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,968
尽管如此，这还是需要勇气的。

656
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:41,777
Anyway, have a good evening.

656
00:41:38,968 --> 00:41:41,777
不管怎样，晚上好。

657
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:43,141
Both of you.

657
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:43,141
你们俩。

658
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:51,087
So how does it feel?

658
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:51,087
那么感觉如何呢？

659
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:54,218
What? To have missed the most
important ball of the match?

659
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:54,218
什么？错过
了比赛中最重要的球？

660
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:55,421
Is that what you did?

660
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:55,421
那是你做的吗？

661
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,715
I felt I owed him a win.

661
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,715
我觉得我欠他一场胜利。

662
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:01,883
I know.

662
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:01,883
我知道。

663
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:03,729
And I love you for it.

663
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:03,729
我爱你。

664
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,294
You do?

664
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,294
你做？

665
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:09,347
Yes, I suppose I do.

665
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:09,347
是的，我想我知道。

666
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,988
Thank you, George.

666
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,988
谢谢你，乔治。

667
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:24,195
Ah.

667
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:24,195
啊。

668
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:27,727
To your very good health.

668
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:27,727
祝您身体健康。

669
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:28,931
Cheers.

669
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:28,931
干杯。

670
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:36,395
You know, I don't remember Pa ever
visiting me at school.

670
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:36,395
你知道，我不记得爸爸曾经
在学校拜访过我。

671
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:39,124
No? He used to take me
out on his rounds, though.

671
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:39,124
不？不过，他过去常常带我
出去巡视。

672
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:41,331
I was nine
when I delivered my first lamb.

672
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:41,331
当我生下第一只羊羔时，我九岁。

673
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,180
And you've never looked back.

673
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,180
而你从未回头。

674
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,585
No, I suppose I didn't.

674
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,585
不，我想我没有。

675
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:51,564
I owe you an apology, Tristan.

675
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:51,564
我欠你一个道歉，特里斯坦。

676
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:54,976
For not telling you
the truth about your results.

676
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:54,976
因为没有告诉你
关于你的结果的真相。

677
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:59,751
I genuinely believed
I was acting in your best interests.

677
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:59,751
我真的相信
我是在为你的最佳利益行事。

678
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,356
Right.

678
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,356
对。

679
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:04,326
But I realise now, that
I may have been...wrong.

679
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:04,326
但我现在意识到，
我可能已经……错了。

680
00:43:07,015 --> 00:43:08,901
Anyway, the money's there,

680
00:43:07,015 --> 00:43:08,901
反正钱到了

681
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:11,831
if you decide you want to go
back to college.

681
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:11,831
如果你决定要
回大学。

682
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:14,640
Equally,
if you feel it's not for you,

682
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:14,640
同样，
如果你觉得它不适合你，

683
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,807
well, it should be your decision.

683
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,807
好吧，这应该是你的决定。

684
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:22,586
Thank you.

684
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:22,586
谢谢你。

685
00:43:29,047 --> 00:43:33,662
Here he is! "An hour to play
and the last man in."

685
00:43:29,047 --> 00:43:33,662
他在这里！“还有一个小时的比赛
，最后一个人进来。”

686
00:43:33,662 --> 00:43:36,230
I think he did very well.

686
00:43:33,662 --> 00:43:36,230
我认为他做得很好。

687
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,314
How're the ribs?

687
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,314
肋骨怎么样？

688
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,638
Bit sore, to be honest.

688
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,638
说实话，有点痛。

689
00:43:38,638 --> 00:43:41,688
Oh, you poor old thing.

689
00:43:38,638 --> 00:43:41,688
哦，你这个可怜的老东西。

690
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:43,694
No Tricki Woo, Mrs Pumphrey?

690
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:43,694
没有特里奇胡，Pumphrey 夫人？

691
00:43:43,694 --> 00:43:45,260
Tricki.

691
00:43:43,694 --> 00:43:45,260
技巧。

692
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,952
Yes, Tricki has some personal
business to attend to.

692
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,952
是的，Tricki 有一些私人
事务要处理。

693
00:43:57,098 --> 00:43:59,305
Think it's time I made my move.

693
00:43:57,098 --> 00:43:59,305
认为是时候采取行动了。

694
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:03,318
Well played, darling.

694
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:03,318
打得好，亲爱的。

695
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:04,562
Hugh and Margot?

695
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:04,562
休和玛格特？

696
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:05,766
Wait, are they...?

696
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:05,766
等等，他们是……？

697
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,656
I think you've missed your chance,
Triss.

697
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,656
我想你已经错过了机会，
特莉丝。

698
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:10,823
Bad luck, old chap.

698
00:44:08,656 --> 00:44:10,823
运气不好，老伙计。

699
00:44:10,823 --> 00:44:12,548
Well,
she wasn't really my type anyway.

699
00:44:10,823 --> 00:44:12,548
好吧，
无论如何她都不是我喜欢的类型。

700
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:13,592
Since when?

700
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:13,592
从何时起？

701
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:16,120
No, it's true, she was...a bit too
tall.

701
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:16,120
不，是真的，她……有点太高了
。

702
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,645
Oh, for heaven's sake.

702
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,645
哦，看在上帝的份上。

703
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:18,729
She's a woman, not a pony.

703
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:18,729
她是女人，不是小马。

704
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:20,775
Oh, height is a consideration.

704
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:20,775
哦，高度是一个考虑因素。

705
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:23,464
You should be so lucky.
Nothing wrong with tall.

705
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:23,464
你应该很幸运。
身材高大没什么不好。

706
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:25,390
I'm a catch.

706
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:25,390
我是个陷阱。

707
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,036
You're a liability.

707
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,036
你是一种责任。

708
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:28,079
THEY LAUGH

708
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:28,079
他们笑了

709
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,466
SNORTING

709
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,466
打鼾
