1
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,120
Mr Hulton's waiting for you
in the yard, Mr Herriot.

2
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,720
Thank you.

3
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,640
Mrs Hall?

4
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,240
Look at this, Mrs Hall.

5
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,160
There's a hole in my
cricket flannels. So there is.

6
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,200
I can't wear them
on Sunday with a hole.

7
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
What would Mrs Pumphrey say?

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
It's a good thing the Lord
invented darning then. Right.

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,320
Thank you.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,920
I've just been speaking to
Richard Alderson. Oh, aye?

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,880
Apparently, we're still a man
short for Sunday.

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,480
It's bad enough that we've
lost our top batsman.

13
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,080
Tristan, I know you're still unhappy
with me, but this - this is cricket.

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,320
The annual Darrowby
match at Pumphrey Manor.

15
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,560
You're not just punishing me,
you know,

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,880
you're letting down the whole team.
Look, I told you -

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,600
I can't play for the Darrowby 11 any
more. Oh, that's just nonsense!

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,520
It's for local farmers
and vets by invitation.

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,080
And I, last time I checked,
am neither.

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,720
Herriot.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,520
Thanks so much for coming out.
No trouble at all.

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,720
I understand you've a bull needs
ringing? I do indeed. This way.

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,080
Here he is.

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,600
This is Monty.

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,800
Only a year old,
but he's a powerful fellow.

26
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,600
No, I can see that! We also need to
move him later today,

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,120
so if you could sedate him
once you've got the ring in.

28
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
That shouldn't be a problem.

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,480
I will need a couple more men to
hold him, though.

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,480
So, Hugh definitely said
it was about a bull?

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
That's what he said. He's got a new
bull that needs ringing.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
And he specifically asked for James?

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,360
He did.

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,080
It's about Helen.
It's got to be.

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,240
I reckon James'
sins finally found him out.

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,560
Don't be daft.

37
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,160
James has done nothing wrong.

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,640
Tell that to Hugh Hulton.

39
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,360
I won't be a moment.

40
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,040
Just going to give him an injection
of local anaesthetic.

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,320
Don't most vets just go ahead
and punch the hole?

42
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,200
They do...

43
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
I find this way works better.

44
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,560
All right, almost done...

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,560
Easy now.

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,440
Huh, look at that.
Didn't bother him at all.

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,480
It usually works.

48
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,960
Now, we just need the ring...

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
So have I missed very much
while I've been away in France?

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Er, no, not that I can think of.
No great Darrowby dramas to report?

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,400
No, just things chugging along,
you know.

52
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
Have you seen much of Helen?

53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,440
No, not a great deal.

54
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,280
But, well, now and again, you know.

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,640
She seems well, does she?

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes... Yes, far as I can tell.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,960
Right, shall we get on with this,
then?

58
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm going up there later, actually,
to Heston Grange. Oh, yes?

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,440
Whoa! Easy, Monty.
I say, James, are you all right?

60
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,680
Come on ,Monty now.
Calm down.

61
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,120
I think I'll live. Glad to hear it.

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,400
So what's the verdict? Any hope?
Oh, there's always hope.

63
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,320
The adjustment nut's a bit stiff,
but once I've worked it loose,

64
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,640
I can raise the bob
and she'll run right to time.

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,680
That's all it needs?

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,040
Well, you have to know how
far to raise it.

67
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
Oh, of course. I don't doubt it
takes a lot of expertise.

68
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,640
Oh, don't know about that.

69
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,880
The main thing to remember is
lower is slower and left is lower.

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,520
Turn it to the right,
it'll go faster.

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,560
That's it.

72
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,280
Ah, so you've a cricketer
in the house. Hm?

73
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,440
Oh, we've two.

74
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,440
But it's Mr Farnon Senior who's
playing in the match on Sunday.

75
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,720
To be honest, I've never
understood the appeal.

76
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,280
I know,
and I call myself a Yorkshireman!

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,800
You'll be at the match, I take it?
I will.

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
In fact, I'll be scoring.

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,160
Ah, so you're something
of an expert?

80
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
An amateur enthusiast, perhaps.

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,040
Anyway, I'll...

82
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,240
I'll let you get on.

83
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,560
Oh, and thanks for the tea. Mm-hm.

84
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,800
What time did Hugh say he'd be up?
11 o'clock.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
And he just said it
where about the lease? He did.

86
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,080
So d'you think he wants to sell?

87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,000
Is that what he's coming to tell us?
You know as much as I do.

88
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,240
What if he's decided
not to renew the lease

89
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,120
because of what happened between me
and him?

90
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,320
Then I'd say you were right
not to marry him.

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
Darrowby, 2-2-9-7.

92
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm sorry, I can barely hear you.

93
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,400
Ah, Mrs Pumphrey!

94
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
Hello, is everything all right?

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,040
Mr Farnon?

96
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,720
No, I see.

97
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,600
Well of course, if it's a
matter of "great delicacy".

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,160
I'll tell him now.

99
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,080
That was Mrs Pumphrey.

100
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,840
She asked if you could go up
to the manor.

101
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Doesn't she want Tricki's
Uncle Herriot? Apparently not.

102
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,320
She said the matter requires
the utmost discretion.

103
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,560
Intriguing. Mm-hm!

104
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,440
"The utmost discretion"?

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,920
What's all that about?

106
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,240
I've no idea -
she said she'll only discuss it

107
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,080
with Siegfried... In person.

108
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,040
Hm!

109
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,400
So, spill the beans.

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,040
What happened at Hulton Hall?

111
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,760
Not a great deal.

112
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,520
What, Hugh didn't challenge you
to a duel for Helen's hand?

113
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but, no.

114
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,800
Well, has he seen her yet?

115
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
Er, no, he said he was going up
later today.

116
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,960
And that doesn't bother you?

117
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,480
Of course not. Why should it?

118
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,760
No reason.

119
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,760
Where are you off to? Nowhere.

120
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,680
I just, erm...
I need run an errand. Oh.

121
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,680
He's here!

122
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
He's here.

123
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,080
Hullo there. How do.

124
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,040
You got back all right, then?

125
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,920
I did. Yes. Thank you.

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,600
Can I make you a cup of tea? Er, no,
no, thanks. I can't stay long.

127
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,400
You said you wanted to speak to us
about the lease?

128
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,080
Yes, yes, that's right. Er...

129
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,840
Ah, here we go.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,720
I intend to renew the lease
on the farm

131
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,960
for the agreed period of 20 years,

132
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
as per our existing contract,

133
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,320
but with a couple of
additional stipulations.

134
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,120
The lawyers have added
Helen's and Jenny's names

135
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,920
and specified that they'll inherit
the lease on the same terms.

136
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,160
That's assuming that they want
to continue farming.

137
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,960
That's wonderful. Thank you.

138
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
Thank you, Hugh.

139
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
It's very good of you.
Not at all, it's...something

140
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,120
that should have been done years
ago, but erm...

141
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,480
Well, it didn't really seem
necessary before.

142
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,400
Er...

143
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,880
Anyway, I think that
just about covers it.

144
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,280
I don't want to take up too
much of your time,

145
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,320
but there's something I'd like
to show you, back at the farm.

146
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,080
I don't understand. Consider it a
replacement, or apology,

147
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,200
if you like, for the difficulties
with the sale of your last bull.

148
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,760
Hugh,, this is too much...
We can't accept this.

149
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
Please, Mr Alderson.
It would mean a great deal.

150
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,920
He's good breeding stock,
excellent condition...

151
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,520
Ah, well even so...
I would really like to make amends.

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Dad, why don't we think about it,
eh?

153
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,760
That's all I ask.

154
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,840
Just keep him here for now
and let me know what you decide.

155
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,320
Right. All right, then. Excellent.

156
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,200
Right, better get on.

157
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Hugh.

158
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,880
Do you have to rush straight
off? Afraid so.

159
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,240
Estate business has rather piled up
while I've been away.

160
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
No doubt see
you at the cricket on Sunday.

161
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,480
You will. Jolly good.

162
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,400
Thank you so much for coming.

163
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,480
Not at all, I understand
Tricki has been rather distressed?

164
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,200
He's not himself at all.

165
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,480
Is he off his food?
Feeling lethargic?

166
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,760
Oh, no, no, there's no
problem in that department.

167
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,560
In fact, if anything, his appetite's
more robust than ever.

168
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
No, it's just, erm...

169
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,880
He's become...

170
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,320
..increasingly...

171
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,560
..amorous towards things.

172
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,240
It's quite unsettling.

173
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,760
In the end,
I had to take his cushion away.

174
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,720
I see...

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Well, let's have a look at him,
shall we?

176
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,320
You know, Mrs Pumphrey,
the behaviour you're describing,

177
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,880
is perfectly normal.

178
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,800
Tricki's a healthy animal
in the prime of life.

179
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,520
And, as such, he's experiencing
some very natural...urges.

180
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,440
Yes, but he's just a baby!

181
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
He's never shown the slightest bit
of interest in...

182
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,320
..that sort of thing.

183
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,520
Well, it's a testament to the
excellent level of care

184
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,080
he's been receiving. His weight's
gone down, his exercise has gone up.

185
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,800
He's obviously feeling a great
deal livelier in every department.

186
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,600
You know, Francois did say
that on one of their outings,

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,920
he seemed intent on getting
into Mr Handshaw's yard.

188
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,280
And does Mr Handshaw own
a dog at all?

189
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,520
Oh, yes, a terrier.

190
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,360
Named Bella, I believe.

191
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,720
Well, that would certainly explain
it.

192
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,280
Less lethargic, more lothario.

193
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,840
So what can be done
to discourage it?

194
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,240
I'm afraid the heart wants
what it wants,

195
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,920
which, in Tricki's case,
would seem to be Bella. Oh, dear.

196
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,400
There is one effective
course of action.

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,320
It's a fairly simple procedure...

198
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, Mr Farnon, no.

199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,840
Can't you just give him
a calming draught of some sort?

200
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm sorry, Mrs Pumphrey.
He'll have to be fixed.

201
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,960
If not, Tricki will simply continue
his pursuit until he succeeds.

202
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,240
Hello, James.
Hello, Jenny. Hello, Scruff.

203
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,680
Wait till you see what
Hugh Hulton's brought us.

204
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Have you ever seen anything like it?

205
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,760
And he'll be worth
a fortune in stud fees.

206
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,920
But Hugh won't accept a penny
for him, says it's an apology

207
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,520
because he wants to move forward
with a clean slate.

208
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,640
Jenny, run and put the kettle on.

209
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,200
Dad'll be wanting a brew
and I'm sure James'd like one.

210
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,240
Fine.

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,400
A pedigree bull.

212
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,560
Quite the gift. I know.

213
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
It were the last thing we expected.

214
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
We haven't said we'll take him yet.

215
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,360
Dad thinks it's far too much,
but even so...

216
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,760
And there you were, worried he might
not even renew the lease.

217
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,440
I know, that's all sorted now too.

218
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,240
He's even added mine and Jenny's
names, so it'll be ours to inherit.

219
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,480
Right. That's very decent of him.

220
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Now, then...

221
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
Mr Alderson.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,720
What do you reckon?

223
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,560
He's a fine specimen.

224
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,680
He is that.

225
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,120
Any luck with Reg Dutton, dad?
Nah, he's still over in Listondale.

226
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,200
Dad's a player down for match
on Sunday. Oh, yes?

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,520
And with Hugh back, they'll be
really up against it.

228
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,840
Hugh's on the opposing team?
He's captain.

229
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,680
Not to mention the star player. He's
the main reason they always win.

230
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,000
Er, not always.

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,320
Though Hugh is a good bowler,
there's no denying it.

232
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,680
You know, Mr Alderson,

233
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,640
if you need an extra man,
I'd be happy to help out.

234
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,080
I didn't know you played.

235
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,760
Yes, well, now and again... Oh, aye.

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,960
You reckon you're up to it,
do you, lad?

237
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,280
Absolutely.

238
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,800
Right.

239
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,840
You're in.

240
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,240
I'm really not much of a cricketer,

241
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,520
but I guess
if it's just a friendly match,

242
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,920
it's not too much to worry about.

243
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,440
Friendly?

244
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,480
James, I would not be exaggerating
to say that this is the most

245
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,680
important game in the
cricketing calendar.

246
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,840
Once a year, the Darrowby 11
goes up against the might

247
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,080
of Hulton Hall's invited gentlemen,
playing for the honour of Darrowby.

248
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,480
And get annihilated.
That's hardly the point.

249
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,640
It's really quite the event, James.

250
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,680
Mrs Pumphrey holds it on her own
private ground.

251
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,480
Sorry, she has a cricket pitch?

252
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,240
Ground, yes, down beyond
the orchard.

253
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,440
The old dear's
completely cricket-mad.

254
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,960
So, when you say you're
"not much of a cricketer"...?

255
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,600
Well, football's more my game.

256
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,640
But you have played?
Once or twice, probably just once.

257
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,400
Oh, dear.

258
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,240
Well, I had no idea it was so
important.

259
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,200
Oh, I'd say it's important!

260
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,680
For a Yorkshireman,
it goes King, God, Cricket.

261
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,320
I mean, if you get this wrong,

262
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,160
they'll string you up in the town
square. Oh, fiddlesticks!

263
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,920
James is fast and he's fit.
All right, it's not his game,

264
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,440
but with a bit of coaching,
he'll do perfectly well.

265
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,520
Quite right. We'll soon whip you
into shape, lad.

266
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,080
So, we've a day and a half.

267
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,520
That's what, 14, 15 hours of
sunlight?

268
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,080
Now, when you played before,

269
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,880
would you say you were more of a
batsman or a bowler?

270
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,600
Well, neither really.

271
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,840
It was on the beach at Troon and it
was probably more what

272
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,480
you would call French cricket.

273
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,360
But it can't be any tougher
than football.

274
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,240
At least in cricket,
no-one tackles you.

275
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,000
You haven't had a cricket ball
coming at you at 80mph.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Seriously, James, one of those could
kill you.

277
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,560
Right, follow me.

278
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,960
Jess, come on, give that,
the boys need it for the cricket.

279
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,120
Thank you. Right, come on.

280
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,760
Right, James. Take your guard.

281
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,800
Remember, middle and leg,
head over the ball, straight back.

282
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,640
Weight on the front foot...

283
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,800
And nice easy lob...

284
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,920
You need to maintain your guard.

285
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,640
How's he getting on? Try again...

286
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,400
You could give your brother a hand.

287
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,960
Yes, and he could apologise
for treating me like a fool.

288
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,560
But I don't see that happening any
time soon either. And...

289
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,840
James, please, try to concentrate!
I...!

290
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,400
Right, once more, take your guard,
middle and leg...

291
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,880
Oh, for the love of God.
James, pass it here.

292
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,160
Right, don't even think about
hitting it,

293
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,080
just think about blocking it.
Blocking it?

294
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,400
You just need to get behind the ball
and stop it, all right? Come on.

295
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,520
As long as it doesn't hit your leg
or the wicket, you'll stay in.

296
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,720
Well, there's a little more to it,
than that...

297
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,520
No, there isn't, not for James. But,
as ever, you're making everything

298
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,120
10,000 times more complicated than
it has to be...

299
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,920
He needs to know what
he should be doing...

300
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,360
No, he needs you to stop confusing
him with pointless stuff.

301
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,080
Just let the man breathe and he'll
work it out for himself.

302
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
James. Here, give it a try.

303
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,880
Right, that's it, just relax,
all you need to do is block it.

304
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,160
It worked! Course it did.

305
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,640
Now, just remember
the cardinal rule -

306
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,120
never step away from your stumps.

307
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,560
Well, at least he's making himself
useful. Despite the injured air.

308
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,760
He feels you still owe him
an apology. Utter nonsense.

309
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,080
So, you played a lot of cricket
at school, then, did you, Triss?

310
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,560
Yes, fair bit.

311
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,120
Captain of the first 11,
weren't you? Darrowby, 2-2-9-7.

312
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,560
Yes, we had a pretty strong
team at the prep school.

313
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,360
Even won the inter-school cup
three years in a row.

314
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,960
I didn't know that.

315
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,720
No? We actually set a new
record for the Under 12s.

316
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,600
The old man came to every match.

317
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,120
Pa used to watch you play?

318
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,640
He'd drive up in the mornings
and we'd make a day of it.

319
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,400
You know how he loved cricket. Yes.

320
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,720
Yes, I suppose he did.

321
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,560
Mr Farnon, Mrs Pumphrey.

322
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,280
She says she's in dire
need of your assistance.

323
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,880
Mrs Pumphrey, what can I do for you?

324
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,320
The workmen were putting up the
tea tent for tomorrow, you see,

325
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,720
and Francois was clearly distracted.

326
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,720
And, erm, poor Tricki, I mean,
he dashed through the main gate

327
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,040
and just ran and ran...
So Tricki is missing?

328
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,920
Foot to the bridge of the ball,
James!

329
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,720
Well, no, not, not exactly.
He was, erm...

330
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,280
He was heading in the
direction of Mr Handshaw's yard.

331
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,520
Ah. And I really can't ask
Francois... No, of course.

332
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,160
Er, leave...leave it with me,
Mrs Pumphrey,

333
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,080
you've nothing to worry about.

334
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,840
Oh, thank you, thank you!

335
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,560
Mr Farnon, when you see Tricki,

336
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,000
could you pretend that you
just happened to be passing?

337
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,960
He's terribly private, I would
hate for him to be embarrassed.

338
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,400
I understand. Of course.

339
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,040
Aye, he's a determined
little bugger.

340
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,320
Well, as I say, Mrs Pumphrey
did want me to pass on

341
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,880
her sincere apologies. Not to worry.

342
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,400
It's not like he's some stray.

343
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,720
A litter or two of pups wouldn't
be the end of the world.

344
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,440
Come on, then, young Trickiwoo,

345
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,080
let's put you back where you belong,
shall we?

346
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,880
See you at the match tomorrow,
Mr Handshaw.

347
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,760
Your brother still not playing? I'm
afraid not. That's a damned shame.

348
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,720
Might've given us a fighting chance.

349
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,960
Well, now he's been there once,

350
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,160
he'll be much more inclined
to visit again.

351
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,040
Right, seems we have no choice.

352
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,760
It's a very simple procedure.

353
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,680
In fact, I should be able to fit
him in on Monday. That soon?

354
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,880
Well, all right.
If we must, we must.

355
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,640
But until then, you really need to
keep him on a lead.

356
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
Oh, Tricki.

357
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,000
Will you ever forgive me?

358
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,360
All set for match tomorrow, I hope?

359
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,280
Absolutely. Raring to go!
Oh, that's the spirit.

360
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,000
And with James playing too, I really
think this might be your year.

361
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,160
I think we're all here.

362
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,760
Ladies and gentlemen, It's my very
great pleasure to welcome you all

363
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,160
to Pumphrey Manor for this year's
encounter between The Darrowby 11

364
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,640
and the Hulton Hall Chaps.

365
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,720
Has anyone seen Mr Rudd?

366
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,840
We'll be playing a timed game, with
the last 20 overs from five o'clock.

367
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,480
And, erm, I know we're all looking
forward to seeing some

368
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,840
excellent cricket.

369
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,680
So, erm, wi...

370
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,240
Without further ado, Mr Chapman?
Yeah?

371
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
If you would do the honours.

372
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,040
Certainly.

373
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,360
Well gentlemen, if you're ready,
will you two captains

374
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,640
accompany me to the
crease with the coin toss, please?

375
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,200
Thank you. Mr Alderson...

376
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,480
Mr Alderson. Young Rudds,
where's your father?

377
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,440
He can't come, Mr Alderson,
the sheep got out

378
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,680
and he needs to round 'em up.
You're kidding me?

379
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,040
No, we're not. We're not.
You're not.

380
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,640
So he's not coming?

381
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,680
So we're a player short.

382
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, go on. You can't let them
go out wi' ten men.

383
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,000
I can always play, Mr Alderson,
if that would be any help?

384
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,160
Help? Yeah, that'd be a big help.

385
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Shame you didn't offer before.

386
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Go and help your dad look for them
sheep.

387
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,840
Welcome to the team.

388
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Yes, thanks.

389
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,840
Afternoon.

390
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,840
Mr Hulton, would you like to make
the call? Heads.

391
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,920
We're bowling, lads.

392
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,960
We're batting.

393
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,320
Well, we've got to do it sometime.
I'd rather do it second, but...

394
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,040
Herriot.

395
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,480
Hugh.

396
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,200
Right, remember what
we did last year?

397
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
Come on, boys, stay alert.

398
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,320
Go on, dad.

399
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,080
Look lively, Herriot.

400
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,920
Come on, lads!

401
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,600
OK, play.

402
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,120
Knock to it, lads, come on!
Unlucky, unlucky!

403
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,360
Good shot...

404
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,400
Four!

405
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,440
Excellent opener, Mr Hulton.

406
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
Looks like Mr Hulton means business.

407
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,120
Herriot.

408
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,680
Oh, good shot!

409
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,960
Yours, Herriot!

410
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,360
Get behind it.

411
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,920
Come on, James!
Unlucky.

412
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,120
Just a single. Keepers' end.

413
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,240
That's Hulton's 50.

414
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,120
Herriot.

415
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,440
James! Ball!
Come on, lad!

416
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,200
Eye on the ball, Mr Herriot.

417
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,560
123...

418
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,920
..for no wickets.

419
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,000
Not out.

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,040
Chin up.

421
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,360
Unlucky. Next time, lads.

422
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,880
James is looking a bit hot.

423
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,360
Hugh's giving him
a right runaround.

424
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,680
Helen.

425
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,880
How are you?
Hello, Margot.

426
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,680
Yeah, I'm fine thank you.
This is my sister, Jenny.

427
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,320
Hello.

428
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,960
Are you enjoying the match?

429
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,440
I will once we start getting
some wickets.

430
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
Oh, yes, of course.

431
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,040
Anyway, I'm sure I'll see
you in the tea tent.

432
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,400
What was all that about?

433
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,680
Let's be having a wicket, Siegfried.

434
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,000
Hello there.
Hello.

435
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,920
I noticed you were rather
tied to your post

436
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,120
and thought you might
be in need of refreshment.

437
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,280
Oh, that's very kind of you.

438
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,200
Thank you.

439
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,320
Your Mr Farnon doesn't seem to be
having much luck.

440
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,080
Trouble is, he's overpitching.

441
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,960
When you say "overpitching"?

442
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,680
He's landing the ball too
close to the batsman,

443
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,840
making it easier to drive.

444
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,640
Go on, James.

445
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,080
He's making it harder for the
fielders.

446
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,040
So he does.

447
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,560
Are you all right, there, Herriot?

448
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,640
Fine, thanks.

449
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,400
Well,
you can't blame the bull this time.

450
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,800
Would you mind changing that to 138?

451
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,320
Mr Chapman. Mm?

452
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,960
I think that's enough.

453
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,360
Come on, Harry.

454
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,080
Ah, and that's the declaration.

455
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,560
Tea, everyone!

456
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,400
What's happening?

457
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,720
Hulton thinks he's got enough runs
to win so he's declared.

458
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
He's stopping.

459
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,520
Well, that's good news for us,
isn't it? Aye.

460
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,640
If you like charity.

461
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,280
I could certainly use a cup of tea.

462
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,160
Well, enjoy it while you can.

463
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,680
We're batting next.

464
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,000
And it won't be pretty.

465
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,440
Pork pie, you love that.

466
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Oh, yum-yum-yum. No?

467
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,280
Or how about a tiny piece of
iced bun?

468
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,280
Oh! Oh, Mr Farnon.

469
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,040
I hope you're not too disheartened.

470
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,560
Oh, not at all.

471
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,360
We've got a lot of strength
in our batting. That's the spirit.

472
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,920
And, you have your secret weapon.

473
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Your brother, of course.

474
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,960
Yes.

475
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,480
He opened quite gloriously
last year.

476
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,240
He did do very well.

477
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,080
Tricki, please.

478
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,240
He simply hates this horrid lead.

479
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,840
Well, it's only till the operation.

480
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,480
And what then?

481
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,720
Can you promise me

482
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,000
he'll still be my Tricki once he's
been emasculated?

483
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,320
Some dogs do present a slight
change in temperament.

484
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,800
Yes, that's what I feared.

485
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,800
It just feels too cruel.

486
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,400
Why shouldn't he be allowed to
express his true self

487
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,160
and experience life to the full?

488
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,920
And if Mr Handshaw were open to
an arrangement...

489
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,480
Well,
he certainly gave that impression.

490
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,880
Well, what would you do, Mr Farnon?

491
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,960
Do you know what, Mrs Pumphrey?

492
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,760
If I were you,
I would forget the lead

493
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,600
and just let Tricki do what
comes naturally.

494
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,720
Life's just too short, isn't it?

495
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,680
I knew you would understand.

496
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,680
Hugh, could I speak to you for a
moment?

497
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,320
Course.

498
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,040
I just want to say, how,
how sorry I am.

499
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,360
For everything that happened.

500
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,120
That's water under the bridge.

501
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,400
No, I know, but I've not had chance
to apologise properly.

502
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,440
In person.

503
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,360
I never wanted to hurt you.

504
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,440
We just weren't right for one
another.

505
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,440
And I knew I wouldn't make
you happy.

506
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,320
Well, I admit I...I was rather
devastated.

507
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,000
But in a way,
once the worst has happened,

508
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,360
it's actually rather freeing.

509
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,440
And I think part of me
always knew it wasn't right.

510
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,080
That we were good pals
and I know you were fond of me,

511
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,560
but...well, it was never a grand
passion, really, was it?

512
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,120
Well, no.

513
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,400
Maybe not.

514
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,040
Maybe one day we can be pals again.

515
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,280
I'd like that.

516
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,880
About the bull.

517
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,000
It was such a generous
thing to do... Did I overstep?

518
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Because that,
that really wasn't my intention.

519
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,160
And me Dad knows you meant well.
We both do.

520
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,640
But we can't accept it.

521
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,280
Right.

522
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,640
Pay our own way.

523
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
Always have.

524
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,240
And you've no reason to feel you
have to make amends.

525
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,280
Didn't realise Herriot was
a cricketer.

526
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,840
Oh,
he stepped in at the last minute.

527
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,000
Ah, keen to impress the Captain,
no doubt.

528
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,880
We only started seeing each other
quite recently.

529
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
I mean,
there were nothing going on before.

530
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,960
Helen, really,
I'm just glad you're happy.

531
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,960
Well, I'd better get
back to the others.

532
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,440
Discuss strategy and all that.

533
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,520
Hello. Oh, there you are...

534
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,440
I saw you chatting with Hugh.

535
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah. We had a really good talk.

536
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,520
I feel like we cleared the air.

537
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,840
Right.

538
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,200
What's wrong?

539
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,040
I just wondered why
he was kissing you.

540
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,960
Kissing me?

541
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
Oh, that were nothing.
Right.

542
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
He just wants to be friends.

543
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,720
And he's given you a pedigree
bull to prove it.

544
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,920
Yeah, well, I've said I'm not
accepting the bull.

545
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,280
You're not?

546
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,000
Course not.

547
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,520
It were a kind gesture,
but we're not in need of charity,

548
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,480
however well meant.

549
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,040
Now, then Herriot.

550
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,960
I'll put you up to bat last with
you being a novice.

551
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,400
Right.
Very good.

552
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,800
Yeah. Let's hope that Hugh takes it
easy with you.

553
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,480
Right, ladies and gentlemen, I think
we are ready to resume.

554
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,760
Hulton's looking deadly serious.

555
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,760
But then I suppose he's
a lot riding on this.

556
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,200
How d'you mean? Well, all those
months he spent in France,

557
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,800
too embarrassed to show his face.

558
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,360
He'll be wanting a win to
restore his dignity. Triss!

559
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,680
Lovely shot, Tristan.

560
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,000
Cracking shot, Tristan!

561
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,840
Go on, Triss.

562
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,120
Brilliant!

563
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,960
Again.

564
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,360
Nicely done. Good running, lads.

565
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,560
Stay.

566
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,240
That's unlucky.

567
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,000
Now that's called a batting
collapse.

568
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's more exciting than I'd
anticipated.

569
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,240
We'll make a cricket convert
of you yet.

570
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,080
You know, I walk Rock
down by Copley Brook most evenings.

571
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,240
If you're ever out with Jess
and want a bit of company.

572
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,840
Well...perhaps we'll see you down
there.

573
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,080
Last over. Doubt you'll be needed.

574
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,280
They need to get two
wickets before you go in

575
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,080
and Siegfried is looking strong.

576
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,960
Catch it. Yes!

577
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,280
Just four balls to face, Henry.

578
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,040
Good luck, Henry.
Come on, Henry. Thanks, lads.

579
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,480
All the best, Henry.

580
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,440
Play.

581
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,040
I spoke too soon.

582
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,520
Right, Herriot, get padded up.

583
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,320
Henry's retiring hurt.

584
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
There's three balls left till
the end of the game.

585
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,760
If they don't get you out,
we'll draw.

586
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,000
And that's as good as a win.
Just do what you can.

587
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,680
All you have to do is stay in,
old chap.

588
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,200
Remember what we practised.

589
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,960
Protect your wicket
and guard your stumps.

590
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,600
Middle leg.

591
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,680
That'll do.

592
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,400
Go on, lad.

593
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,800
Three balls to come.

594
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,040
Fine.

595
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,760
You all right, Jim?

596
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,920
Well done, James.

597
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,280
Run.

598
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,320
It's gone for four.

599
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,760
Back this end, old chap.

600
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,160
Last ball of the match.

601
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,680
Just block it again,
exactly the same as before,

602
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,920
and Hugh'll be
crying into his beer tonight.

603
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,760
Come on, Mr Herriot. Come on, James.

604
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,200
Unlucky, batsman.

605
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,760
Hard luck, lad.

606
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,160
Thanks, Bert.

607
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,400
Funny that, almost looked like you
deliberately stepped

608
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,040
away from the wicket.

609
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,480
Why ever would I do that?

610
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,800
I've absolutely no idea.

611
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,320
Hey. Bad luck, Mr Herriot.

612
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,360
Nearly had a draw there.

613
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,880
Aye, still, well played, lads.

614
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,160
They were a tough side
and no mistake.

615
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,640
You carried your bat.

616
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,040
Great achievement.

617
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,360
Both of you.

618
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,240
The old man would be proud.

619
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,640
That's, erm, very fine batting,
young Farnon.

620
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,000
James didn't do too badly either.

621
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Till he lost his nerve.

622
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,880
Dad!

623
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,720
Oh, well, I'm only saying it to him.

624
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Good try, Uncle Herriot.

625
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,840
Thank you, Mrs Pumphrey.

626
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,560
Well done, Triss.
Thanks, Helen.

627
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,080
Well done.

628
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,680
I don't think your dad's too happy.

629
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,200
Don't worry about him.

630
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,560
James, I just wanted to say...

631
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,600
..well played.

632
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,280
You too.

633
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,440
I suppose the best team won.

634
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,760
Still, that took real grit.

635
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,560
Anyway, have a good evening.

636
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,920
Both of you.

637
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,840
So how does it feel?

638
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,960
What? To have missed the most
important ball of the match?

639
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,160
Is that what you did?

640
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,440
I felt I owed him a win.

641
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,600
I know.

642
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,440
And I love you for it.

643
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,000
You do?

644
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,040
Yes, I suppose I do.

645
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,640
Thank you, George.

646
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,840
Ah.

647
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,360
To your very good health.

648
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,560
Cheers.

649
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,000
You know, I don't remember Pa ever
visiting me at school.

650
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,720
No? He used to take me
out on his rounds, though.

651
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,920
I was nine
when I delivered my first lamb.

652
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,760
And you've never looked back.

653
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,160
No, I suppose I didn't.

654
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,120
I owe you an apology, Tristan.

655
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,520
For not telling you
the truth about your results.

656
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,280
I genuinely believed
I was acting in your best interests.

657
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,880
Right.

658
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,840
But I realise now, that
I may have been...wrong.

659
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,400
Anyway, the money's there,

660
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,320
if you decide you want to go
back to college.

661
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,120
Equally,
if you feel it's not for you,

662
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,280
well, it should be your decision.

663
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,040
Thank you.

664
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,080
Here he is! "An hour to play
and the last man in."

665
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,640
I think he did very well.

666
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,720
How're the ribs?

667
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,040
Bit sore, to be honest.

668
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,080
Oh, you poor old thing.

669
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,080
No Tricki Woo, Mrs Pumphrey?

670
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,640
Tricki.

671
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,320
Yes, Tricki has some personal
business to attend to.

672
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,640
Think it's time I made my move.

673
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,640
Well played, darling.

674
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,880
Hugh and Margot?

675
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,080
Wait, are they...?

676
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,960
I think you've missed your chance,
Triss.

677
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,120
Bad luck, old chap.

678
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,840
Well,
she wasn't really my type anyway.

679
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,880
Since when?

680
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,400
No, it's true, she was...a bit too
tall.

681
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,920
Oh, for heaven's sake.

682
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,000
She's a woman, not a pony.

683
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,040
Oh, height is a consideration.

684
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,720
You should be so lucky.
Nothing wrong with tall.

685
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,640
I'm a catch.

686
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,280
You're a liability.

687
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,400
