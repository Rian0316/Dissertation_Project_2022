1
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,680
Oh.

2
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
I say, this is...

3
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,440
Thought you'd like it.

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,200
Like it?

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,240
It's magnificent.

6
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,760
This means a lot, Siegfried.
Thank you.

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,240
Not at all.
Not at all.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,000
Happy birthday.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,480
Yes, Happy birthday, Triss.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,920
Right, more tea.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,440
Oh, I've...

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,840
..one more present for you.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,640
You're giving me my own list?

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I have decided it's time to let you
stand on your own two feet.

15
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,240
Oh.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,480
Right.

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,600
So I'll be going out on my own?

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,280
Well, to all intents and purposes.
I thought James could come along,

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,080
just in case.
But it'll be your show.

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,520
That is if you
think you can handle it?

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,720
Oh, yes, yes, absolutely.
Excellent.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,320
Hang on does that say
"Sebright Saunders"?

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,680
Are you sending me to the estate?

24
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,080
Uh-huh.

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,720
They've a number of horses need
tooth filing.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
They're valuable animals too,

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,520
so make sure you've
got your wits about you.

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Of course.

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,240
That bag won't be much
use to you empty.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,280
Right.

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,120
Make sure you take a decent rasp.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,640
Will do.
And a spare.

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,120
Tristan?

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,280
Did you hear me?

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,960
Tristan?!

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Good evening with Helen, were it?

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,240
It was, thanks.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,080
She's a smashing lass.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,840
Have you had the chance to talk
over Glasgow with her?

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,400
Not yet.

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,440
I know.
I'll do it today.

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,040
Candy's in foal so I said I'd go up
and take a look.

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,760
I'll tell her about the job, then.

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,640
Jacket.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,320
Are you sure you've got tweezers?
Yes.

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,760
Both sizes?
Yes, and yes.

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,320
I actually do know what I'm doing.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,520
Stop your fussing.
You'll make him nervous.

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,400
Here...

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,200
Very smart.

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,080
Every inch the professional.

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,280
Yes, well, come on,
don't be keeping them waiting.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,480
So will Mrs Brompton be joining us
at the Drovers for birthday drinks?

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,440
I think she's planning to
drop in briefly.

55
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,040
Hope you told her to come
before things get too rowdy.

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,560
Oh, it's just a few drinks.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,400
Please try not to get
completely legless.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
I can assure you, I'm planning a
very civilised evening. Oh, yes?

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
It's not like I'm a student any
more.

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Things have changed.

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,120
In fact, I was half wondering

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,160
if a little dinner might be
more appropriate.

63
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,440
Oh, aye? I mean, it wouldn't have to
be anything fancy,

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,400
but if it's too much trouble.

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,880
Birthday dinner for six at less
than a day's notice?

66
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,800
No, no, you're right, it's a
stupid idea...

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm sure I can rustle something up.

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,600
Oh, Mrs H, you're an absolute star.

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,560
That's one word for it.

70
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,760
And actually, if you could make it
dinner for seven...

71
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, for the love of God...

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,040
I just thought I might want to
invite a guest.

73
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,800
And who exactly might you
want to invite?

74
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,400
I don't know yet,
but the day is still young.

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,760
Good luck, Tristan.

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,600
He doesn't need luck.
He just needs to concentrate.

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,280
ENGINE WHINES

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
ENGINE GRINDS

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,200
Right, cheerio.

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,640
He'll be fine.
'Course he will.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,160
Right, so, when we get to the
estate, I'll just introduce myself

82
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,560
and explain that I'll be dealing
with the horses today.

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,760
I'm fairly sure they'll know
who you are, Triss.

84
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,680
You've been coming out to the
farms half your life.

85
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,880
Yes, as Siegfried's little brother,
maybe.

86
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,360
But now I'm here as a vet.

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,200
It's a whole different
kettle of fish.

88
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,800
You're going to do fine.
You know what he's doing, don't you?

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,240
He's basically setting me
up to fail.

90
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,920
I don't think that's true.

91
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,080
He's giving me this big new chance.

92
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,440
But he's just waiting for me
to mess it up.

93
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,760
Where's Farnon?
Right here.

94
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,360
You what?

95
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,840
Tristan Farnon, Mr Monkham.

96
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,160
Siegfried's brother.
And fully qualified vet.

97
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,360
I'll be taking care of the tooth
rasping today.

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,040
Mr Farnon always sees to the
horses himself.

99
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,960
Well, he's asked me
to deputise on this occasion.

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,480
Aye.
What you gonna be doing?

101
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,960
I'm just here to observe.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,520
Right, well,
I can't say as I like it.

103
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,760
But I haven't got all day.

104
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,080
So, let's see what you've got.

105
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,840
This way. Right...

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,760
You wanted this?
Please.

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,680
Poor Bonnie here had quite
a sizeable lipoma on her ribcage.

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,480
Oh. Benign, but, still,
an ugly great mass.

109
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,280
Luckily, I was able to remove it
with remarkable ease.

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,240
Let's just, erm, lay her down on
that blanket, while she comes round.

111
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Might take an hour or so.

112
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,800
That's the ticket.

113
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,000
There we are.

114
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,960
Yes.
Very nice, though I say so myself,
it should hardly leave a scar.

115
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,600
DOG YELPS

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,320
Should she be doing that?

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,840
Oh, it's nothing to worry about,

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,240
happens to some animals after
an anaesthetic.

119
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,200
It's just the barbiturates
leaving the system.

120
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,080
Well, I'm off to the butcher's.

121
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,120
If I can get a decent enough joint,

122
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,400
I might try my hand
at a beef Wellington.

123
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,120
Goodness,
that's rather elaborate.

124
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,160
Well, I don't want your young
ladies thinking

125
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,040
we don't know how to entertain.

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,320
I assume Mrs Brompton's still
joining us?

127
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,600
Yes, yes, she was delighted with the
invitation.

128
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, in't that nice.

129
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,800
Right, well, as I'm done, I think
I'll head out too.

130
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,960
And see how Triss is getting on.

131
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,120
You said he needs to
stand on his own two feet.

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,480
So let him.

133
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
Just don't let him rattle you.

134
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,520
Absolutely.

135
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,000
Just focus on the job in hand.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,960
HORSES NEIGH LOUDLY

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,040
Who's that?

138
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,320
Oh, yes.
Miss Margot Sebright Saunders.

139
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Might she be a suitable candidate?

140
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,160
Rather out of my league, I fear.

141
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
Margot's generally
squired by minor gentry.

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,520
You're a man of means now.

143
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,040
A respectable professional.

144
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,240
She might see you in a whole
new light.

145
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,160
See?

146
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,360
You don't want to miss
out for a lack of confidence.

147
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,400
Ah, you may have a point.

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Nothing ventured.

149
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,680
It certainly worked for you
and Helen.

150
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,840
Well, it's early days.

151
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,040
I still have time to mess it up.

152
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
Are you two coming?

153
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,720
Excellent.

154
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,240
There's another two need
doing, across the yard.

155
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,040
Right, let's take a look, shall we?

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
Hope he's not a kicker.

157
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,280
Right, here we go, good lad.

158
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,040
Ah yes, I can see there's quite
a sharp point just here.

159
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,200
Should be able to file
that off nicely.

160
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,240
If you could just hold him steady?

161
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Monkham? Yes, Miss Margot.

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,440
I want to ride out to
Sennor Woods this afternoon.

163
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Will you see that my horse is ready?
Yes, Miss. Gosh.

164
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,080
Are you an actual vet now, Tristan?
That's right.

165
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Tristan Sebastian Farnon, MRCVS,
at your service.

166
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,120
Well, well done you.
Yes, I've got all the credentials.

167
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,040
And the qualifications and the...

168
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
Wonderful.

169
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm just going up to the house, but
I'll be back for him after lunch.

170
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
Yes, Miss.

171
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,280
Aye, I'll let you get on, then.

172
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,080
Jolly good.
You're doing grand.

173
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,720
HORSE NEIGHS LOUDLY
Easy, boy.

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
Good Lord,
what's going on out there?

175
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,880
That'll be Satan.

176
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
Oh, yes?
Aye.

177
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
He's another that needs raspin'.

178
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
DOG WHIMPERS

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,880
"Oh, what can ail thee,
dog-at-arms,

180
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
"Alone and palely loitering?"

181
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,600
There's nothing
physical that I can see.

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,440
Just don't like being by yourself,
is that it?

183
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,000
Perhaps you could play with Jess.

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you sure she's not
sickening for something?

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,200
Not in the least,
she's perfectly healthy.

186
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,440
Probably just wants
a bit of company.

187
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
And where are you off to?

188
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,720
Oh, I found a spare
rasp for Tristan.

189
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,880
He'll be almost done, won't he?

190
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,040
Still, better safe than sorry.

191
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,920
DOG WHIMPERS

192
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,600
If you'd rather I...
No, of course not.

193
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,120
In for a penny.

194
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,520
Right.

195
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,280
Let's take a look at your teeth,
then, shall we?

196
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,680
HORSE NEIGHS LOUDLY

197
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,760
That's it, that's it, old fella.
Come on.

198
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,680
Nothing to worry about, that's it.

199
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,760
I am just going to...
Ah!

200
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,680
Are you all right, Triss?

201
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
Did he get you?

202
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,960
It's fine.

203
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,520
He barely made contact.

204
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,400
You sure?

205
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
Uh-huh.

206
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,440
He nearly broke my kneecap.
Seriously, Jim.

207
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,640
I thought I was going to pass
out at one point.

208
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
You should have let me take over.

209
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Oh, Siegfried would love that.

210
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,800
"A man doesn't stop work
because of a bruise,

211
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,000
"cuts and scrapes come with
the territory.

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
"A good vet never puts his own
comfort before that of the animal."

213
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,080
Caught you a good 'un, did he?

214
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,040
Er, yes, yes.
It seems he did.

215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,000
Aye.
Evil bugger.

216
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,640
HE CHUCKLES

217
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,080
Well, he seems positively
delighted by the whole thing.

218
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,400
They like to feel they're
getting their money's worth.

219
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,120
What? So, the more pain and
suffering, the better?

220
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,000
That's Dales folk for you.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
They're a sadistic bunch.

222
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,920
Oh, I say, Mrs H, smells marvellous.
It really does.

223
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,120
Yes, well, it's just bread
and cheese for now.

224
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
So hands off.

225
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,680
You really didn't need to
do all of this.

226
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,920
Your birthday only comes
round once a year.

227
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,240
Just eat up and then you can get
out from under me feet.

228
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,640
Siegfried not around?

229
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,840
Erm, no.
He, err, he went out.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,160
Out where?

231
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,880
I think he, err,
was hoping to catch up with you.

232
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,560
Something about a spare rasp.

233
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,560
Seriously?
So he said.

234
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,280
Unbelievable.

235
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,760
He went to check up on me,
didn't he?

236
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,520
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

237
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,240
My apologies, Mrs Hall.

238
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,680
You're all right.
Lunch is cold, anyway.

239
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,200
Jolly good.

240
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,760
I heard we missed you at the estate?
What?

241
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,240
Oh, yes.
No matter.

242
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,120
I just had a quick chat with
Monkham.

243
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,160
So, what did Mr Monkham
have to say, then?

244
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,440
Not a great deal.

245
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,200
He did say you should learn to
move a bit quicker.

246
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
You do have to watch yourself
with those stallions.

247
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,440
Yes. I know.

248
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,160
Nothing else?

249
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,760
Should there have been?

250
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,760
No, no, not at all.

251
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,200
PHONE RINGS

252
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,440
I'll get it.

253
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,200
You know, I've been giving some
thought to those suggestions

254
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
you made about the improvements.

255
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,640
Oh, yes?

256
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,680
We should sit down and start making
some plans together.

257
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,320
That'd be great.
Thank you, Siegfried.

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,000
All down to money, of course.

259
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
But I think it's time.

260
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,200
That was Dobson, his heifer's
in labour but it's not progressing.

261
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,520
I said we'd head over to lend a
hand. Right, oh.

262
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,640
James, weren't you going to
check on the Alderson's mare?

263
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,320
I was but it's nothing that can't
wait. I can run by tomorrow.

264
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,160
No, no.
You should go this afternoon.

265
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
We mustn't let the Aldersons down.

266
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,320
Tristan can manage at Dobson's.

267
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,920
Can't you?

268
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,880
Yes, yes, shouldn't be a problem.
That's settled, then.

269
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,320
Except, how will I get there?

270
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,280
You'll have to take the Rover.

271
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,960
Oh, I, I think I'd probably be
better in the Vauxhall.

272
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,400
James will need the Vauxhall.

273
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,640
But still,
the Rover's your pride and joy.

274
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,480
I can easily walk over to see
Hardwick's ewe.

275
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,120
Besides, it'll go with the new bag.

276
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,520
Now, just mind
the steering on the bends.

277
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,440
Shut up.

278
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,760
I'm sure you can handle it.

279
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,920
Right.

280
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
See you later.

281
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,320
James, when you're done at the
Alderson's, perhaps you could call

282
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
by and see how Triss is getting on?

283
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
HORN BEEPS

284
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,440
Wrong way.

285
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,640
That might not be a bad idea.

286
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,880
Oh, and...

287
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,160
..I hope it goes well with Helen.

288
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,040
HORSE NEIGHS

289
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,360
Oh, hello again.
Hello.

290
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,880
Just on my way to my next call.

291
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
Thought I'd stop
and see how he's getting on.

292
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,040
All right, there, boy?

293
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,480
NEIGHS LOUDLY

294
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,800
You know, I took extra special
care with his teeth.

295
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,200
Thanks.

296
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Is that your car?

297
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,040
Isn't she a beauty?

298
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
It's very smart.

299
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,040
Well, I'd best not keep this
one waiting...

300
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,960
It's my birthday today.
Is it really?

301
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,360
Well, many happy returns.

302
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,600
Yes, well, I mean, I don't make a
big thing of them as a rule,

303
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,760
but I am actually having a small
party, well, more of a dinner,

304
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,920
a dinner party.

305
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,960
Just a few close friends, erm,

306
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Helen Alderson will be there,
if you happen to be free.

307
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,560
Oh, I haven't seen
Helen in an absolute age.

308
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,040
I'm sure she'd be
thrilled to see you.

309
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,280
So what d'you say?

310
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,920
All right, then.

311
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
I'll see you this evening.

312
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,560
7:30, or 8:00,
or just, you know, come whenever.

313
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,880
See you!

314
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,960
GEESE CRY

315
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,880
Mr Dobson, I got
here as fast as I could.

316
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,320
Oh, aye?
You did the right thing calling.

317
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,800
Has there been any progress?

318
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,040
Well, no.
Not so's you'd notice.

319
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,960
Then I shall begin with
a thorough examination.

320
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
I'm afraid these things aren't
always as simple as they appear.

321
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,440
I'll lead the way, shall I?

322
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,440
Very good.
Nice and steady.

323
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I'll just check her...

324
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,160
Such efficiency.

325
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,000
We aim to please.

326
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,840
RICHARD CLEARS THROAT

327
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
Right.

328
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,640
She's all right, then?

329
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,320
Well, she's a way to go,

330
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,120
but, yes, mother and foal are both
coming along very nicely.

331
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,560
Heart-rate and....

332
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
..temperature, all fine.

333
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,440
In a few months' time,
you'll have your very own pony.

334
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,000
Lucky girl.

335
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,440
Candy were our mam's.

336
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,080
Yeah, sort of like the next
generation.

337
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,520
I see.
Besides, it's just practical.

338
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,400
It takes forever to walk
up to the top field.

339
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,480
'Course, if you'd let me drive the
tractor...

340
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,080
Yeah, well, maybe's when your feet
reach the pedal's, you can.

341
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Dad, I've been tall enough for
months and you know it.

342
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,560
Aye, annoying enough, you're
right...

343
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm practically an adult,
you know...

344
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,920
She will be soon,
much as I hate to admit it.

345
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,600
Come on, then.

346
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,600
Thanks for coming up.
Not at all.

347
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,840
Do I need to bring anything
this evening?

348
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,120
I don't think so,
Mrs Hall has it all in hand.

349
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,800
I didn't have Triss
down as the dinner-party sort.

350
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,880
Ah, well, this is a whole new
Tristan we're talking about.

351
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
Speaking of which...
I should get going.

352
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,640
I said I'd check in on him.

353
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,240
How's he getting on?

354
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,040
Surprisingly well.
Good for him.

355
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,920
It's good news for the rest of us,
too.

356
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,080
Now he's out on calls,
we can split the night shifts.

357
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,400
Up in, erm, Glasgow, I only had to
be on call once a week.

358
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,200
I thought you liked being out
in the Dales under the moonlight?

359
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
Oh, I do.

360
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,160
It's just, I quite like a full
night's sleep, too.

361
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,640
It's a good job you didn't
stay in Glasgow any longer, then,

362
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,200
sounds like you'd have gone soft.

363
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
Yeah.

364
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
You're probably right.

365
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,320
How you doing there, Tris?

366
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,360
Thought I'd see
if you needed a hand.

367
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,720
Mr Dobson.

368
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,480
I'm managing as best I can
at the moment.

369
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,240
Although, the presentation does...

370
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,800
..present some serious difficulties.

371
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,400
Both legs are back.

372
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,320
It's got an incredibly long pelvis.

373
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
It is long.

374
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,800
Oh, God, here comes another!

375
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,960
COW MOANS

376
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,960
Erm, everything all right there,
Tris?

377
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,560
I just need a moment.

378
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,200
DOG WHINES

379
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,440
WHINING STOPS

380
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,040
Thank the Lord.

381
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,640
DOG WAILS

382
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,000
For the love of...

383
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,480
What's wrong with you,
you daft ha'p'orth?

384
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,000
Eh? Hmm?

385
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Oh, come on.

386
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,680
Not nice, always being
on your own, is it? Mmm?

387
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,120
Come on.

388
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,880
But you so much as sniff at
my beef Wellington,

389
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,160
you'll be out in the shed.

390
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,440
Tris, do you want me to...?

391
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,440
You poor lad.

392
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,960
What can I do?

393
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,600
Could you manage a sip of tea?

394
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,640
Yes.

395
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Seriously,
you need to let me take over.

396
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,720
I've come too far to stop now,
James.

397
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
Can't be much longer.

398
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,400
You brave lad.

399
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,040
You've earned something much
stronger than a tea after this.

400
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,160
Yes!

401
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,680
Oh, God.

402
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,640
Here we go again.

403
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,160
COW AND TRISTAN GROAN

404
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,440
Evening, Mrs Hall.

405
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,200
Oh, don't worry, I'm early.
I thought you might need a hand.

406
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,080
Oh, you are good.

407
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,840
Well, those napkins need going on
the table.

408
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,640
But take your coat off first.

409
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,320
And will you call me Aud?

410
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
You've known me long enough.

411
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,840
I can't believe what you've
pulled off here, Aud.

412
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,320
If it were me, I'd have told Tris
he could have a cold buffet

413
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,440
and count himself lucky.

414
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,360
Oh, the cooking's no trouble.

415
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,200
It's all the other madness.

416
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Siegfried up to his usual tricks,
is he?

417
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,200
He's being...very nice. Oh.

418
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,520
Even let Tristan drive the Rover.

419
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,320
That's not like him. Well, no.

420
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,360
I think Tristan's finding it
quite unnerving.

421
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,520
To be honest, we all are.

422
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,040
James says Tris is doing well,
though.

423
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
So far, so good.

424
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,640
He reckons it'll mean you can make
some changes around here. Seems so.

425
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,920
I think he got used to the easy life
in Glasgow.

426
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,120
To be honest,
I'm half surprised ever came back.

427
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,320
I think his mother
was certainly keen for him

428
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,040
to accept the permanent position.

429
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,120
Did they offer him one?

430
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,880
Apparently.

431
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,520
I don't know all the details.

432
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,560
Right.

433
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,000
He didn't say anything. Did he not?

434
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
Now, I think we're just about ready.

435
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,280
Though, with that blessed Labrador
howling nonstop earlier,

436
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,600
I'm just hoping I haven't put
peas in the blancmange.

437
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,640
Good feeling, isn't it?

438
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,680
It really is.

439
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,720
First calf.

440
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,360
And I didn't mess it up.

441
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,040
Thanks again, Mr Farnon.

442
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,200
You take care now. Will do.

443
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,120
HE STRAINS
Good evening, Mr Dobson.

444
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,920
You're sure you'll be all right,
driving with that shoulder?

445
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,120
We can easily leave the Rover
and we could...

446
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,760
You bugger!

447
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,400
You were putting that on?

448
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,440
You've got to admit,
it was an inspired performance.

449
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,880
I'll tell you something,

450
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,760
Siegfried is going to get a glowing
report from Mr Dobson.

451
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,800
Yeah, I suppose.

452
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,160
Siegfried really is proud of you,
you know.

453
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,320
No, he's not.

454
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,440
But maybe after today, he might stop
thinking I'm a hopeless case.

455
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,000
Helen, you're here!

456
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,320
Oh, happy birthday, Tris.

457
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,520
James.

458
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,120
Hello, there.

459
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,960
Have you seen Siegfried?

460
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,600
He said something about a telephone
call from Mr Dobson.

461
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,560
Right.

462
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,680
I'd better go change.

463
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,280
Everything OK?

464
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,960
Mmm-hmm.

465
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,680
I should take these through.

466
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,080
No, that's very helpful, Mr Dobson.

467
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,160
Thank you. Yes, and you.

468
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,760
Siegfried.

469
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,040
Everything all right?

470
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,840
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

471
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,160
Right, yes. All good.

472
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
One calf delivered safe and sound.

473
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,200
As one would hope.

474
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,720
DOORBELL

475
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,880
Well, go on, then, get yourself
dressed, you've guests arriving.

476
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,520
I just thought you might want to...
I'll get it, shall I?

477
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,760
Yes.

478
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,160
No, I should.

479
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,280
Mrs Brompton, hello.

480
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,200
Thank you.

481
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,360
I do hope I'm not too early.

482
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,400
Not at all, you're right on time.

483
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,480
Diana. Siegfried.

484
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,000
My, how dashing you look. Thank you.

485
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,240
A spot of blue ruin, for when you
boys huddle up with your port.

486
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,600
No need for me and Mrs Hall to
miss out. Don't you agree?

487
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,400
Very kind of you, I'm sure.

488
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,040
Come in.
DOORBELL

489
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,000
So, where's the birthday boy?

490
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,320
I hope, changing into
less-odoriferous attire.

491
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,640
Oh, Siegfried, you are dreadful.

492
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,800
Good evening.

493
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,200
Margot Sebright Saunders.

494
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,400
Tristan did say to come at 7:30?

495
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Yes, of course.

496
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,120
Please, do come in. Thank you.

497
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,240
So lovely to finally meet you,
Mrs Farnon.

498
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,400
These are for you.

499
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,720
No, I'm not...

500
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,040
Siegfried, honestly.

501
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,360
Is something you haven't told me?

502
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,640
I'm Mrs Hall, the housekeeper.

503
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

504
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,240
Erm, should I...?

505
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,960
I'll just put these in water.

506
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,360
Margot, do come in.

507
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,880
Now, then, ladies, if this
amontillado is too dry for you,

508
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,400
I do have something sweeter.

509
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Oh, I think we're sweet enough
already, don't you, Margot?

510
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,560
Oh, yes, absolutely!

511
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,160
Helen, I believe you know
Ms Sebright Saunders? Helen!

512
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,560
So lovely to see you.

513
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,920
Margot, how are you?

514
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,560
Oh, I'm perfectly fine.

515
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,760
But how are you?

516
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,800
I was simply devastated about
you and Hugh.

517
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,120
We all were.

518
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,000
Oh, that's very kind of you.

519
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,120
I'm so glad to see you out
and about, despite everything.

520
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,400
Right, here we are. Thank you.

521
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,680
What's all that about? Hmm?

522
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,560
Oh, Margot was an old pal of Hugh's.

523
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,440
Family friends or what have you.

524
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,200
You didn't think
to mention that before?

525
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Has he said anything to you?
Who? Siegfried.

526
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
I know he's spoken
to Dobson on the phone.

527
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,840
If he thinks I've botched
it somehow,

528
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,440
why doesn't he just say something?

529
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,000
If you'd all like to come through,

530
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,440
dinner is served.

531
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,400
So, Margot, how's that
May mare of your father's?

532
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,960
Will he be entering her
on the northwest circuit?

533
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,200
I should think so.
She's showing excellent form.

534
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,080
I look forward to seeing
her in action.

535
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,680
Well, she'll be up against the
Hulton's new gelding.

536
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,400
He's having a pretty good season.

537
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,840
Just a shame Hugh's missing all
the events.

538
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,200
Who's this?

539
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,360
Erm, Hugh Hulton. Oh.

540
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,840
I keep telling him,
should just come back from France.

541
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,040
I'm sure he's having
a fine old time. I doubt it.

542
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,160
He said he felt too ashamed to
show his face in Darrowby.

543
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,240
Though what he's got to be
ashamed of, I really don't know.

544
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,480
Hugh has nothing to be ashamed of.

545
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,000
But I had to be honest with him.

546
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,320
The longer I let it go on,

547
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,080
the worse it would have
got for both of us.

548
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,560
I agree.
Far better to make a clean break.

549
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,720
No point in prolonging the agony.

550
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,920
I suppose not.

551
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,600
You know, Mrs Hall,
this soup is absolutely first-rate.

552
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
ALL AGREE

553
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,120
Best one yet, Mrs H.
Oh, it were no bother at all.

554
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,280
No, that's going in the pantry...

555
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,000
GENERAL CHATTER

556
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,600
Especially for you, Tris.

557
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,480
Oh, good choice, James.

558
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,840
GLASS CHIMES

559
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,840
If I might have your attention
for a moment, ladies and gentlemen.

560
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,600
First of all, Mrs Hall, thank you
for making such a delicious meal,

561
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,720
beef of which Wellington
would be proud.

562
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,240
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.

563
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,200
Now, as some of you know, today was
not only my brother's birthday,

564
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,800
it was also his first day
out on call as lead vet.

565
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,240
Goodness! How exciting.

566
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,640
Now, to say that
I had my reservations...

567
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,080
Would be putting it mildly.

568
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,160
And I admit I thought
it prudent to keep a close eye

569
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,680
on his progress
throughout the day.

570
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,920
Having said all that,
to my surprise,

571
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,200
and, dare I say it, delight,

572
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,080
the reports of his work have been

573
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,720
uniformly excellent.

574
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,840
So, a toast.

575
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,000
To Tristan.

576
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,040
Many happy returns and my heartfelt
congratulations.

577
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,680
ALL: To Tristan.

578
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,240
Well done.

579
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,480
That was lovely.

580
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,760
You sound almost like a
proud father.

581
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,240
Yes, well, I suppose in a way,
that's how I feel.

582
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,760
DOG WHINES

583
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,320
Oh, no. Good heavens, what's that?

584
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,520
Oh, it's fine,
she'll calm down in a minute.

585
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,080
It sounds like something's in pain.

586
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,760
I almost wonder if it might
be a post-operative complication.

587
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,440
It's not a complication, she just
doesn't like being on her own.

588
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,280
I'll let her out as soon
as we've finished.

589
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,760
I'd be more than happy to
take a look.

590
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,960
I've already examined her
thoroughly, thank you.

591
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,680
You know, the thing
I've realised today is,

592
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,760
it doesn't matter how good a vet
you are, people only respect you

593
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,960
once they see you putting in
the hard graft.

594
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,840
Well, no-one could fault you there,
Tris. No.

595
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,160
Because, at the end of the day,

596
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,800
I'm not afraid to go the extra mile,
if that's what it takes.

597
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,120
You certainly went all out.

598
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,840
If it's sweat and tears they want,
I'll give it to them.

599
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,920
If you've done anything to embarrass
this practice, Tristan...

600
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,200
No, no, not at all.

601
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,080
I may have exaggerated the effort
involved a little.

602
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,520
No, really?

603
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,120
A few well-placed groans,
some unnecessarily straining sinews

604
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,720
and a final howl of pain.

605
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,560
Goodness!

606
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,880
A final what?

607
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,120
Ah, I may have got slightly carried
away but it had the desired effect.

608
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,160
What is wrong with you?

609
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,360
For God's sake,
after that fiasco with the chickens?

610
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,960
I thought you'd finally come to your
senses. And I have, absolutely...

611
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,840
I thought you'd finally started to
take responsibly for your actions.

612
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,640
Complete responsibility, totally.
But fair's fair, old chap,

613
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,920
you're hardly averse
to putting on a show yourself.

614
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,920
I would never resort to playacting
and tomfoolery.

615
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,440
Oh, come off it.
You and your purple powder?

616
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,120
Blinding the great unwashed with
the magic of science.

617
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,320
That is entirely different.
I don't see how.

618
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,760
Because I know what I'm doing.
Yes, well, so do I.

619
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,000
I seriously doubt that. Well, I've
got the qualifications to prove it.

620
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,160
So you think.

621
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,800
Wait, what?

622
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,240
Why don't we all go through,
everyone?

623
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,520
I can make us some drinks
and see to that dog.

624
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,440
Are you saying I didn't pass?

625
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,120
You told me that I passed.

626
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,880
You said categorically... I know.

627
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,120
I may have...omitted one or two
of the finer details.

628
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,240
So, I didn't pass.

629
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,640
You narrowly missed the mark on
one paper, parasitology.

630
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,720
But really, in the great scheme
of things, just a tiny, white lie.

631
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,920
You're not serious.

632
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,520
You tried so hard and I knew how
disappointed you'd be, so I just...

633
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,000
I bent the truth a little.

634
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,120
You let me think I was qualified
when I wasn't.

635
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,040
And then you let me carry on showing
off like a complete idiot.

636
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,240
All this time, I've been a
total laughing stock.

637
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,720
Oh, for God's sake, you'd already
wasted so much time on those

638
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,440
blasted exams, I thought you'd be
better off getting out there,

639
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,840
getting your hands dirty, and I've
been proven right, haven't I?

640
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,480
I don't believe you.

641
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,840
Even now, you can't admit that
you're in the wrong.

642
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,000
I don't see that I am, necessarily.

643
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,440
Oh, well, there's a surprise.

644
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,760
Well, thank you so much for dinner.

645
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,320
It were very nice to meet you.

646
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,760
Only, Tristan did say
he would drive me home.

647
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,800
Not to worry,
I can give you a lift, Margot.

648
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
That's awfully kind of you.

649
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,120
I'm sorry about all this.
Please, don't apologise.

650
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,680
We shall have to have that
gin sometime.

651
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,160
Helen.

652
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
I'm sorry.

653
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,600
I appreciate now that it can't have
been easy for you either.

654
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,400
It's fine, Margot. Really. Well...

655
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,120
..I hope you'll both be very happy.

656
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,600
Come on, Margot!

657
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,200
Goodnight, ladies.

658
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You're sure
I can't help you tidy up?

659
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,480
Oh, I think a discreet exit's
probably best.

660
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,520
Thanks for this. Enjoy.

661
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,120
I made you some blancmange.

662
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,560
I'm sticking to liquids,
thanks all the same.

663
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,760
Tris... Did you know?

664
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,160
Why didn't you tell me?

665
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,280
I'm so sorry.

666
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,960
I only found out later.

667
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,400
And your brother's intentions
weren't bad.

668
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
Even if, perhaps, his methods were.

669
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,280
Didn't even buy the bag, did he?

670
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,000
He was still the one
who paid for it.

671
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,640
You have no idea how much
he cares for you.

672
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,080
And worries about you.

673
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,760
It's just hard for him...
Hard for him?

674
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,240
That's rich.

675
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,760
I am truly sorry.

676
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,760
Siegfried's outdone himself
this time.

677
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,160
I mean, I'm sure he meant well...

678
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,600
But the road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

679
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,440
So, what will it mean for the
practice if Tris isn't stepping up?

680
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,800
Well, I suppose any modernisation
will have to wait.

681
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,320
Helen, there's something to talk
to you about. It's about Glasgow.

682
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,040
They offered you a job.

683
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,160
How did you...?
Audrey thought I knew.

684
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,240
Right.

685
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,120
I'm so sorry,
I've been wanting to tell you.

686
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,040
Are you considering it?

687
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,280
I see.

688
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,320
It's not...

689
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,240
The chap I was covering for
is leaving,

690
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,800
so they need to replace him
and, well,

691
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,680
Bill told my mum and next thing
I know,

692
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,360
she told him I'm taking the job.

693
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,520
Right.

694
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,320
And are you? No, I...

695
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,080
I don't know.

696
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,320
I need to make a decision but
whatever I decide,

697
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,720
I'll be letting people down.

698
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,960
Oh, James,
why didn't you say something?

699
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,920
I didn't want you to feel like I was
putting pressure on you.

700
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,480
How do you mean?

701
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,160
Helen...

702
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,000
..I want to be with you.

703
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,000
And that means staying in Darrowby,
and I love it here, I do.

704
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,800
The place, the work, the people.

705
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,320
But if I stay...

706
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,960
You'll break your mother's heart.

707
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,000
They've given up so much for me.

708
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,000
I don't know what I'm going to do.

709
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,480
Well then, we'll just have to work
something out, won't we?

710
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,680
Stay for another brew.

711
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,760
I'd love to.

712
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
But I better get back
and check on Tris.

713
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
DOOR OPENS

714
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,560
Have the others turned in?

715
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,080
Are you all right?

716
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Just dandy.

717
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,280
I mean,
I've been publicly humiliated,

718
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,840
shown up as a laughing stock...

719
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,800
Tris... ..but I'm exacting
my revenge with a very fine malt.

720
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,800
Is that Siegfried's special bottle?

721
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Certainly was.

722
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,840
Here.

723
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,440
Come on.

724
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,880
Misery loves company and all that.

725
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,720
Would it have made a difference
if you'd found out sooner?

726
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,560
What, that I'm a complete failure?

727
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,360
Don't know.
Maybe ignorance was bliss.

728
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,040
There are plenty of fine vets with
no qualifications.

729
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,040
You know you can do the work,
that's what matters.

730
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,000
Come on.

731
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,920
Where are we going?

732
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,480
Unless I'm mistaken,
it's still my birthday,

733
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,440
so I say we go and get blasted
at the Drovers.

734
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,640
All right, then.

735
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,440
And bring the whisky.

736
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,360
You know, we should have just gone

737
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,560
to the bloody pub in
the first place.

738
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,600
