1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,886
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,800
The last two years
are a blank.

3
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:05,100
That's a fresh approach.

4
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,400
I believe you.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,296
Mike couldn't place
a familiar face...

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,299
Whoever killed her...

7
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,642
The police couldn't
identify a murder victim...

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,951
-Pulled out all her teeth.
-There's no signature.

9
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:17,269
Gabrielle was getting
showered with gifts...

10
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,720
Buyer asked to
remain anonymous.

11
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:19,838
From a mystery suitor.

12
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:21,364
I'm gonna open up
a pizza parlor!

13
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,066
And Lynette
couldn't believe...

14
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:23,933
Oh, dear God.

15
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,460
What her husband
had done.

16
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:27,560
I wanna do what...
you wanna do.

17
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:30,302
Julie's first love
was two-timing her,

18
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:32,832
And Orson's first wife...

19
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:33,833
I'm Alma Hodge.

20
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:34,970
Wasn't going away...

21
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:36,362
-What do you think?
-I'll take it.

22
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:37,992
Anytime soon.

23
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:44,960
Your average housewife
worries constantly

24
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:48,600
about the dangerous people
she sees on the nightly news.

25
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:53,203
Which is why she buy
expensive alarm systems,

26
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:56,503
carries pepper spray
in her purse,

27
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:59,902
and keeps a gun
in her drawer,

28
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:05,521
so she can go about her day
feeling safe and protected.

29
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:11,061
Your average inmate
worries constantly

30
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:14,613
about the dangerous people
he comes in contact with every day.

31
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:19,631
Which is why
he takes ordinary items,

32
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,851
And turns them
into weapons,

33
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,890
that he always
keeps handy,

34
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:30,833
so he can go about his day
feeling safe and protected.

35
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:35,603
What is the difference between
the housewife and the inmate?

36
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:41,400
The inmate knows
the feeling won't last long.

37
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:01,502
Delfino, right?

38
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah.

39
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,011
So?

40
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:24,302
Come on, brah,
let's go.

41
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,703
You okay?

42
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:26,542
Yeah.

43
00:02:28,218 --> 00:02:29,481
I owe you one.

44
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:32,561
Yeah. I guess you do.

45
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,670
Yes, we all need protection

46
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,801
from those who
would do us harm...

47
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:45,323
And sometimes from
those who protect us.

49
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,021
Wild parties.

50
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,691
Handsome strangers.

51
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,112
Tender kisses.

52
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:03,302
I had a great time.

53
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:04,203
Bye.

54
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:06,863
Yes, there were
many things

55
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:10,401
Gabrielle Solis liked
about being single again...

56
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,783
But coming home to
an empty house...

57
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,023
was not one of them.

58
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:25,612
What?

59
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,761
Hi. You're sleeping
at my place tonight.

60
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:36,902
Really?

61
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:39,301
What did you
have in mind?

62
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,072
God, I hate myife.

63
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:44,952
Honestly, did you think
I was gonna sleep with you?

64
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,892
It would be the polite
way to thank me.

65
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:48,223
Carlos, this isn't funny.

66
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,170
I am scared to death
of this maniac.

67
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:51,643
Since when?

68
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:55,403
Yesterday you were loving
all the presents, the intrigue.

69
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:56,933
The guy broke
into the house.

70
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:59,093
He went from secret
admirer to stalker.

71
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,750
For all I know, he's trying to kill me
so no one else will have me.

72
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:03,733
Why don't you just
call the cops?

73
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:04,872
And tell them what?

74
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:08,563
"911, sobody broke in the house
and left a 6,000 dollars dress."

75
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,740
Okay, so if this guy
shows up again,

76
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:12,180
what am I supposed
to do, exactly?

77
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,701
Nothing. Just having
you here helps.

78
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:17,671
Now that's very sweet.

79
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:20,911
Because when he breaks in and starts
hacking you up with his machete,

80
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:23,413
your screams will wake me up,
and then I'll be able escape.

81
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:27,203
Glad I could help.

82
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:35,183
Hey, stranger.

83
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:37,400
Hey.

84
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:38,933
You have good timing.

85
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,080
I just got all the
kids to sleep.

86
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,481
Ah, damn,
I wanted to tuck 'em in.

87
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:46,443
Well, you could
tuck me in.

88
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:51,002
I thought I smelled
your sex perfume.

89
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,581
Come here. Hi.

90
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,843
-Hi.
-Hi.

91
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,892
Oh, oh, oh. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

92
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,163
Don't  get me all
revived up just yet.

93
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:01,881
The printer said he was gonna drop
off my menu on his way home.

94
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,311
He already did.

95
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:06,721
Oh, you didn't look
at that, did you?

96
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:07,903
'Cause it's just
a mock-up.

97
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,731
Too late. I looked...
and it's great.

98
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,162
Really?

99
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:17,400
Yes. I love the font,
the color, everything.

100
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:21,003
I am so jazzed
to see the restaurant.

101
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:23,020
It is so good
to hear that.

102
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:31,253
So... any idea
when that might be?

103
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:32,731
Sure.

104
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:35,292
How about...
two weeks?

105
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:35,791
Hey.

106
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:38,322
You open in
two weeks.

107
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,421
Yeah. Well, that'd be a good
time for you to come by,

108
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:43,193
'cause there's free refills, 
balloons, music...

109
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:46,172
Might there be
a V.I.P. preview

110
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:48,702
for people, say,
who bore your children?

111
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:52,101
-Lynette...
-Yeah?

112
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:54,900
I don't want you to see it
until it's all done.

113
00:05:57,677 --> 00:05:58,273
Why not?

114
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:00,183
Because you will take
one look at the place

115
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:02,203
and then you'll have all
these tips and suggestions

116
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:03,983
that you just won't be able
to keep to yourself.

117
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:06,062
You think?
'Cause I just saw

118
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:08,001
a  take-out menu with
a 6-digit phone number,

119
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,062
and I kept that to myself.

120
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:12,542
See? There it is! That snarky,
know-it-all attitude.

121
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,503
What? I am snarky because I point
out one small, glaring mistake?

122
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:17,460
That's it.

123
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,900
Now you're banned
from the opening.

124
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,293
Fine! Good night.

125
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:28,300
So... we're not
having sex?

126
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:31,743
Hey, you banned me
from your opening.

127
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:43,702
All I'm saying is that I'd
feel a lot safer on the pill.

128
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,841
But if you're not 18,
you need parental consent.

129
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,003
Do we really need to give your
mother another reason to hate me?

130
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:51,482
She'll hate you a lot worse
if you get me... Hey!

131
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:53,503
Hi.

132
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:55,283
Hi

133
00:06:58,396 --> 00:06:58,940
Bye.

134
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:00,283
-Bye.
-Bye.

135
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,791
Can't we just keep using condoms
and be extra careful?

136
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:11,960
Are  you crazy?
They're not dependable.

137
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,701
Sure, they are. Why do you
think everybody uses them?

138
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:16,963
They all have to
pass inspection.

139
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,143
It's too risky.

140
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,383
Condoms are only
85% effective.

141
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:23,200
Mom!

142
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:25,423
Mom, what happened?
Are you okay?

143
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:28,580
Oh! I was just, uh...

144
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,778
I lost an earring.

145
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:33,724
Mom, you're wearing
both your earrings.

146
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:37,106
Oh! I found it.

147
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,802
Austin, I would like to talk
to my daughter privately.

148
00:07:42,238 --> 00:07:43,622
Sure. Call me later.

149
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,891
Why were you two
talking about condoms?

150
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:52,120
Why were you
eavesdropping?

151
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:53,471
Don't change
the subject.

152
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:54,982
Are you two
having sex?

153
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:57,521
Because I thought that I raised
you to be smarter than that.

154
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,821
Don't you realize that
sex is not fun and games?

155
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:01,963
It's dangerous.

156
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:03,762
Every time you turn around,
there's a new disease.

157
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,473
Do you want it to burn
when you pee?

158
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,090
-Mom! Mom!
-Sex kills!

159
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:07,810
What?

160
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:09,543
I'm not having sex.

161
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:11,922
Really?

162
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:13,572
Really.

163
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:16,413
Oh, thank God.

164
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,521
If you're not having sex, why were
you talking about condoms?

165
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,900
Because we know two
kids at school who are,

166
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,660
and they're only
using condoms,

167
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:30,471
which really stupid because
condoms are only 85% effective.

168
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,393
Yes. That's right.

169
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,850
A condom alone
will not protect you.

170
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:39,262
I totally agree.

171
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:53,760
Bree!

172
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:54,481
Alma!

173
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:56,603
I didn't know that
you knew Edie.

174
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,920
I told your friends at that dinner party
I was looking for a new house.

175
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,521
A house?

176
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,030
Yes, and Gaby
introduced us.

177
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,341
Oh. Well, um...

178
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:07,823
I don't want
to keep you.

179
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:11,533
I'm sure that Edie has lots
of other houses to show you.

180
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,111
Nope. We're done.

181
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:16,453
Alma took one look at the
Applewhite house, am bam...

182
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:17,960
love at first sight.

183
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:18,932
What?

184
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,371
We're gonna
be neighbors.

185
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,523
No!

186
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:24,302
I mean...

187
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:27,892
I mean, no, Alma,
you can't buy this house.

188
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:28,710
Why not?

189
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,961
Well, are you aware
of its history?

190
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:34,460
The previous owner...
was harboring a murderer.

191
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:35,571
It was her son.

192
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,003
Say what you like,
she was a great Mom.

193
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:40,162
They had a dungeon
in the basement.

194
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,503
I mean, people say they still hear
groans coming from the house night.

195
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:47,500
They're gonna hear groans coming
from your house if you don't zip it.

196
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,463
Don't worry, Alma,
I'm sure that, uh,

197
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,892
Edie can find you a house that
won't give you nightmares.

198
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:55,803
It's too late, Bree.

199
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,163
I've fallen in love
with this neighborhood.

200
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:01,501
And as for that haunted house
stuff, well, that's just silly.

201
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:03,603
People don't come
back from the dead.

202
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,453
Don't I wish.

203
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:17,520
I will not have that
woman as a neighbor.

204
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:19,020
You have got
to do something.

205
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,601
I said I'd talk to her.

206
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:21,803
So what are you
waiting for?

207
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:23,450
The house is dark.
She's not there.

208
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,700
Oh, so you're just gonna
wait until she moves in?

209
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,862
I will deal with it.
Bree, please calm down.

210
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:28,930
How can I be calm?!

211
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:31,502
For months, people thought
you killed your first wife.

212
00:10:31,536 --> 00:10:33,762
No sooner does she show up
and clear your name,

213
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:36,581
than the police haul you off
to ask you about another murder!

214
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:37,921
They just had some questions.

215
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:39,300
Everybody has questions.

216
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:41,401
Susan and I aren't even
speaking because of it.

217
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:42,411
Bree, please.

218
00:10:42,905 --> 00:10:45,300
I try to hold my
head up and smile

219
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,273
and just bake more pies
for the church social.

220
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,752
But now your ex is camped
out on our doorstep

221
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:53,152
like I am hosting some kind
of mormon slumber party,

222
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:56,300
And I do not know how I am gonna
bake my way out of this one!

223
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:58,512
Darling,

224
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,533
I swear to you, I will get
Alma out of that house.

225
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:04,490
I don't care if I have to live up to
my reputation and strangle her.

226
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:08,873
You're a good husband.

227
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:12,350
Have you lost
your mind?

228
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,361
I am not getting
you the pill.

229
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:16,892
Aunt Edie,
Julie and I are in love.

230
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:20,433
Oh, please. It's not love
you're feeling. It's hormones.

231
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:21,513
That's not true.

232
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:22,900
Okay, fine.

233
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,382
If you want to...

234
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:28,391
express your love, you
don't need to go all the way.

235
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:30,791
Kiss. Touch. Rub.

236
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:32,803
I mean, whatever happened
to heavy petting?

237
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:34,793
It's so underrated.

238
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:36,720
That's your advice?

239
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,163
Well, I'm sorry. I've never been good
at getting people not to have sex.

240
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,601
So you're not
gonna help us?

241
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:47,151
Julie, if I do this, your
mother would have my head.

242
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,711
You should
be talking to her.

243
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:50,971
I can't talk to her.

244
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:53,211
The whole idea of this
completely freaks her out.

245
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,391
She started screaming,
"sex kills."

246
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:58,502
So now it's
all in my lap.

247
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:01,401
God, she pisses me off.

248
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:06,021
Look, how about I spring
for a box of condoms?

249
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,591
Will that get you two
off my back?

250
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:10,590
Condoms are only
85% effective.

251
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:12,091
Is that true?

252
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:17,163
Damn. I thought I could coast
all the way to menopause.

253
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:20,652
Look, we're gonna have sex
whether you help us or not.

254
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:23,030
We're just trying
to be responsible.

255
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:27,881
All right. 

256
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:30,581
But just so you know,

257
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,220
the responsible thing
is to abstain from sex

258
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:35,000
and focus on
your studies.

259
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:40,182
There. I said it out loud,
just in case anybody asks.

260
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,731
Gaby, I need
another pillow.

261
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:47,271
All right, don't take the
big one. That's my favorite.

262
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:49,400
It's only for
one night.

263
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:52,490
'Cause tomorrow I'm gonna be back
home sleeping in my own bed.

264
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:53,221
W hat?!

265
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:56,702
You can't abandon me!
There's a madman stalking me.

266
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,491
My life is on the line.

267
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:00,470
Do you know
how scared I am?

268
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,093
You're keeping that?

269
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,310
Hey, I'm scared,
but not of the dress.

270
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:30,450
Carlos!

271
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:32,512
Carlos, wake up!

272
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:34,000
I need you!

273
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:36,001
Oh, yeah, I thought
you'd come around.

274
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:37,332
What? No!

275
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:38,640
Hey!

276
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:39,901
He's here.

277
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:52,521
Don't!

278
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,722
Carlos, be careful!
He might have a gun!

279
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:58,963
I'm unarmed.
Stop kicking me!

280
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:01,062
Oh, now you're gonna
give me attitude?!

281
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,860
Gaby, we got him.
Maintain.

282
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:04,460
This jerk has been
terrorizing me.

283
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:05,570
He broke into
my house!

284
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:07,253
It  was a 6,000
dollars dress,

285
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:09,613
and my boss didn't want me
leaving it on the porch.

286
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:11,662
Your boss?

287
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,553
Hey, uh, ahem,
I'm sorry to wake you, sir,

288
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,733
But there was a problem
dropping off the gift.

289
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:22,231
Yes, and she's, uh,
right here... with me.

290
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,500
This is Gabrielle.
Who the hell is this?

291
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:28,500
Yes, I got your "token of esteem,"
and I'm not impressed.

292
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,801
Because you're freaking
me out, that's why!

293
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,890
No, I don't care how much it cost.
That's beside the point.

294
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,552
Really? That much?

295
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,913
Tell him if he doesn't stop harassing
you, you're gonna call the cops.

296
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:45,612
Look, I know you're
trying to be romantic,

297
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,801
but if you keep this up,
I'm gonna be forced...

298
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:53,651
What'd he say?

299
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,171
That's very
sweet of you,

300
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:57,721
but I am not the most
beautiful woman in the world.

301
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:00,003
Tell him you're gonna get
a restraining order on him.

302
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:02,440
Yes, I may be
in the top ten.

303
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,182
Gaby!

304
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,092
Hey, I'm talking here!

305
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:09,000
Your voice sounds so
familiar. Do I know you?

306
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:12,902
He says I know him,

307
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:15,102
and that he wants to
reintroduce himself at dinner.

308
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,131
Absolutely not. 

309
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:20,290
I would not feel comfortable
meeting for dinner.

310
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:21,843
Good girl.

311
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:23,792
-How about lunch?
-Gaby!

312
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:26,870
But you have to promise to stop
buying me these expensive gifts.

313
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:29,363
Because I'm not
that kind of girl.

314
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,663
Well, for that many karats,

315
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,301
yes, I could be
that kind of girl.

316
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:35,070
Um,  I gotta go.

317
00:15:35,415 --> 00:15:36,841
I'll talk to you tomorrow!

318
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:39,672
Oh, how about that?

319
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:42,981
And here I was, thinking some guy
wants to murder me in my sleep.

320
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,122
The night's still young.

321
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:54,892
How are those ribs?

322
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:59,821
Ah, just needed some tape.
Man, those guys were hard-core.

323
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:01,672
You really saved my ass.

324
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:03,101
Don't mention it.

325
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:05,511
No. Seriously.

326
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:07,852
Ever anything
I can do for you,

327
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:09,400
you just say the word.

328
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:11,352
I'll keep that in mind.

329
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:13,732
Hey, Delfino.

330
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:18,351
Yeah, boss?

331
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:21,360
You might wanna find
yourself another prom date.

332
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,002
Guy's not your friend.

333
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:25,202
How do you know that?

334
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,423
After those mutts knocked you
around the other day,

335
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,180
Your boy paid 'em off.

336
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:31,903
You sure?

337
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:34,121
I saw money
change hands.

338
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:35,752
Just watch your back.

339
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,852
So I was in the middle
of totally freaking out

340
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:49,152
when Julie assured me
that she's not having sex.

341
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:51,173
I can't tell you
how relieved I was.

342
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,703
Uh-huh.

343
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:56,750
Don't say "uh-huh" like that.
Julie wouldn't lie to me.

344
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,643
She says she's not having sex,
then she's not having sex.

345
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:01,300
Ooh-kay.

346
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,203
You can't say "ooh-kay"
like that, either.

347
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:07,322
Julie's not like other girls.
She's a straight-A student.

348
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,572
And you were
valedictorian.

349
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:11,802
What were you up to that
your mother didn't know about?

350
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,140
Okay, you search the closet.
I'm gonna look under the bed.

351
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:19,843
Wait, wait, wait.
First rule of ransacking...

352
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,423
Remember where
everything goes.

353
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:26,043
You are gonna make a really
good mother someday.

354
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:29,333
So what does this
diary look like?

355
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,761
Uh, it's small.
It's got a plaid cover.

356
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,972
Oh, and when you find it,
you have to read it,

357
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:36,411
because I promised her that I
would always respect her privacy.

358
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:38,030
Now help me
flip this mattress.

359
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:39,133
Oh( Oh, my God!

360
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:40,222
You found it?

361
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:42,203
This is adorable!

362
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:45,502
-You think maybe I could...
-No, you cannot borrow it.

363
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,101
Fine.

364
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,550
Why does Julie
have a VCR?

365
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:52,301
To watch movies.

366
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:55,942
Please. Kids don't watch videos
anymore. Everything's digital.

367
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,580
See? It's just a tape.

368
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:09,500
Is it?

369
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:26,413
Alma.

370
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:29,122
What do you think
you're doing?

371
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:32,501
Measuring for drapes.

372
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:34,341
I'm thinking damask.

373
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,451
You know
what I mean.

374
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:39,571
Why have you
moved here?

375
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:42,133
Well, it's a very
nice street,

376
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:44,670
and I've made
friends here.

377
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:48,602
People have taken
such an interest in me.

378
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,103
Yeah, they thought
you were dead.

379
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,233
The novelty of your not being
a corpse can't last forever.

380
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,401
What are you
after, hmm?

381
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,973
Are you still
punishing me?

382
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,000
You want me to pay
you to leave? What?

383
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,502
I want what I've
always wanted...

384
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,200
You.

385
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:09,892
I'm married.

386
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:13,482
And even if I weren't,
I don't love you.

387
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:17,001
You didn't love
the old Alma.

388
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:18,700
I'm not that
woman anymore.

389
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,923
I'm stronger,
more confident.

390
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:24,903
It may take you a while
to see that, but I can wait.

391
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,262
Alma, I love Bree.

392
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:29,443
But does she love you?

393
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,551
Oh, she may love
the Orson she knows...

394
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:37,161
But does she know
what you did to Monique?

395
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,703
Does she know you
ran over Mike Delfino?

396
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:44,552
I know all that.

397
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:46,972
I still love you.

398
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:49,530
Would she?

399
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,210
So I see you've
spoken to Mother.

400
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:08,622
Yes. It's nice to have someone
on my side in all of this.

401
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:13,400
Don't worry.
I won't tell Bree.

402
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:14,913
She might go
to the police,

403
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:17,581
And you're no good
to me in jail.

404
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:23,341
But if I thought I had
no chance with you,

405
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,112
no chance at all...

406
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:28,832
Well, there'd be nothing
to stop me from telling.

407
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:32,403
Please, Orson,

408
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:35,883
Don't take
away my hope.

409
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:50,901
She's not going.

410
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:53,183
Why not?

411
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,072
And what the hell was
that on the porch?!

412
00:20:57,025 --> 00:21:00,021
She kissed me good-bye.
What was I supposed to do, slug her?

413
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:02,560
You went over there to
read her the right act.

414
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:04,962
Instead, it looked like you were
reading her a bedtime story.

415
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,852
Bree, I told her
we don't want her here.

416
00:21:08,027 --> 00:21:09,560
I threatened, I shouted.

417
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:11,250
She refuses to go.

418
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,301
We're just gonna have
to make the best of it.

419
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:20,492
Hello?

420
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:23,530
Hey, it's me.
You wanna meet for lunch?

421
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,363
No, honey, I got...

422
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,671
I gotta drive to greendale
to picout napkins.

423
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,392
Remember?
I told you.

424
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,912
Oh. Yeah, that's right.

425
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:33,883
So I'll, um,
I'll see you tonight.

426
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,303
Okay. Good.
I'll see ya.

427
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:06,761
Oh... my... God.

428
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:13,401
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.

429
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:15,113
Andrew, hi!

430
00:22:15,628 --> 00:22:17,593
I thought you weren't
starting until the opening.

431
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:20,300
Oh, yeah, there's just so much
work that needs to be done.

432
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,950
Mr. Scavo asked me
to start early.

433
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:25,002
He's not here,
by the way.

434
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:28,450
Yeah, I know. And hey,
don't tell him I stopped by.

435
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:32,142
I'm not supposed to be here.
I just wanted to sneak a peek.

436
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,002
Shouldn't you
be working?

437
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,152
Shouldn't you
not be here?

438
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:41,693
Touché.

439
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,582
So, uh, how do you
like the place?

440
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:48,322
I think it's fantastic.

441
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:51,930
It's really coming together.
Oh, I love the bar.

442
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,161
Oh, yeah, it's, uh,
it's pretty cool.

443
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,203
It's too bad we can't
get a liquor license.

444
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:57,311
What?

445
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:00,202
Oh, uh, didn't
Mr. Scavo tell you?

446
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:03,083
No... he didn't.

447
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:08,351
Don't, um, restaurants make
half their money on the liquor?

448
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:11,220
Oh. Yeah. We're
completely screwed.

449
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:13,792
This is a nightmare.

450
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:15,703
How did this happen?

451
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:18,383
The city rezoned and said

452
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:20,792
he had to get all the residents
within a block to sign a waiver,

453
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:22,563
and there are
some holdouts.

454
00:23:22,758 --> 00:23:23,632
He's kinda bummin'.

455
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:27,002
Well, then why isn't he dealing with
it Instead of shopping for napkins?

456
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:33,452
We could lose our
shirts in this dump!

457
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,161
Is this Dr. Marvin Tashman?

458
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,033
Hi. My name
is Susan Mayer.

459
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:43,072
My daughter Julie
came in to see you...

460
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:45,552
Yes, about birth control.

461
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:47,201
So I'm just curious...

462
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:51,672
Where do you get off prescribing
that without my consent?!

463
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:56,372
What?! No, I most
certainly was not there.

464
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:58,433
What do I look like?

465
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:01,091
I don't have blonde hair.

466
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:09,593
Wait, did my blonde
hair have dark roots?

467
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:15,602
I forgot to give you
the keys to the shed.

468
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:20,222
You got my daughter
the pill?!

469
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:22,130
Here. Catch.

470
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:27,703
Don't you walk
away from me!

471
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:31,453
-Do we have to do this now?
-Yes, we do.

472
00:24:31,797 --> 00:24:34,223
You might have gotten your
first diaphragm with milk money,

473
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,842
but that doesn't give you the
right to corrupt my daughter! 

474
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:38,701
Look, it's not like I went
after Julie and said,

475
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,321
"Hey, do you wanna go out for a
burger and some birth control?"

476
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:42,763
She came to me.

477
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:45,210
You do not get to
decide this for her!

478
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,663
What were
you thinking?!

479
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:49,593
I was thinking,
if Julie got knocked up,

480
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:52,491
that you and I could become
family, and I'm sorry,

481
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:54,240
-I cannot take that chance.
-Oh, you know what?

482
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:58,022
It wasn't till your rotten nephew came
to town that Julie was a perfect kid.

483
00:24:58,218 --> 00:25:01,500
And now she's lying and scheming
and having casual sex!

484
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:04,392
She's just a boob job
away from being you!

485
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:07,200
Look, Mayer,
Julie has discovered sex.

486
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:08,890
The genie is out
of the bottle.

487
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,690
And you better get good with it,
or you could lose her forever.

488
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:14,483
'Cause like it or not,
she loves him.

489
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,701
And you know
what else?

490
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,623
He loves her.

491
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,440
Your gentleman friend
went to make a call.

492
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:35,973
-He'll be with you shortly.
-Thank you.

493
00:25:58,708 --> 00:25:59,402
Gabrielle.

494
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:04,161
Zach Young!

495
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:07,033
Oh, my God!
It's been ages.

496
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:12,201
Look at you!
So handsome in a suit.

497
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:13,442
You look beautiful.

498
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:15,011
Aren't you sweet?

499
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:19,920
Uh, well, anyway,
I'd love to catch up,

500
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:21,522
but I'm kinda waiting
for someone.

501
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:23,553
Yes, I know.

502
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,770
So the dress fits. Cool.

503
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:41,800
I'd like a bottle of your 1982
Château Lafite Rothschild, please.

504
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,131
I'm sorry.
How old are you?

505
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:47,683
Why don't we say...

506
00:26:48,847 --> 00:26:49,623
A hundred?

507
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:51,602
So you are.

508
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:56,702
Wow, someone got an
advance on their allowance.

509
00:26:57,538 --> 00:26:59,050
I was my grandfather's
sole heir.

510
00:26:59,676 --> 00:27:01,742
I'm actually
in the Fortune 400.

511
00:27:03,126 --> 00:27:04,623
Does that seem
weird to you?

512
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:06,651
I'm on a date
with Zach Young.

513
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:08,273
Nothing's ever gonna
seem weird again.

514
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,381
Every cent we have
is circling the bowl,

515
00:27:13,387 --> 00:27:15,741
and Tom never said a word.
Why didn't he come to me?

516
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:17,433
Well, clearly,
he's embarrassed.

517
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:20,323
-But I'm his wife.
-Don't be dense, Lynette.

518
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:22,881
Half the reason men
want to accomplish anything

519
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:24,653
is so they can show off
for the women they love,

520
00:27:24,757 --> 00:27:27,113
and when they fail, they like
to keep it to themselves.

521
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:28,432
I'm gonna tell him.

522
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:30,290
I'm gonna tell him
I went to the restaurant,

523
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:34,980
and that I know he screwed up
and that I'm gonna fix it.

524
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:37,703
Oh, for God sake, it's bad
enough you cut off his cojones.

525
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:38,911
Now you wanna
juggle them?

526
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:41,360
My husband is
in trouble.

527
00:27:41,597 --> 00:27:43,712
I love him. Shouldn't
I want to help him?

528
00:27:43,835 --> 00:27:45,283
Well, if you really love him,
you should help him

529
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:47,071
without letting him
know that you did.

530
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,453
Yeah, so in addition
to my penthouse,

531
00:27:54,635 --> 00:27:56,632
I also have a château
in Switzerland

532
00:27:56,845 --> 00:27:58,662
and a cottage
in the Hamptons.

533
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:00,283
That's pretty
impressive, huh?

534
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:02,790
You got a little chocolate
on your shirt.

535
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:05,053
Damn it!

536
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:07,293
-Here, let me get it.
-No, I can do it! I can do it!

537
00:28:07,308 --> 00:28:09,182
I'd like to do it myself,
thank you very much.

538
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:12,870
I'm sorry, I...

539
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,700
You know, I'll be neater
for you ne time.

540
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:16,092
Next time?

541
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:19,100
Honey, let's get real.
You are way too young for me.

542
00:28:20,776 --> 00:28:22,890
I'm two months older
than John Rowland.

543
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,301
Well, John Rowland
was a mistake.

544
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:29,531
I was lonely.

545
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:32,083
You're not
lonely now?

546
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:34,760
You've heard
about my divorce.

547
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:37,200
Yeah. You were really smart
to get rid of Carlos.

548
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:38,400
You deserve
much better.

549
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:41,702
And let me guess,
now you're my upgrade?

550
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:46,270
Well, everybody knows you need
someone to take care of you and,

551
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:49,601
I'm rich now. I can give
you anything you want.

552
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:53,520
Wait a minute. Who says I need
someone to take care of me?

553
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:56,932
My Mom, her friends
from the neighborhood.

554
00:28:57,677 --> 00:28:59,400
They said it was the only reason
you stayed with Carlos,

555
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:00,890
considering
how he treated you.

556
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:06,320
Well, they were wrong.

557
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:08,592
Thank you for
lunch, Zach.

558
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,163
Wait, Gabrielle.

559
00:29:11,755 --> 00:29:13,791
I'm not that awkward
kid that I was before.

560
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:16,522
Can you please just...

561
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:18,500
Please take me
seriously.

562
00:29:19,276 --> 00:29:20,693
I'm sorry. I just can't.

563
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:23,310
I'm not, I'm not
gonna give up.

564
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,203
Oh, sweetie.

565
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,592
I really wish
you would.

566
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:37,180
For God sakes, Zach!

567
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:39,902
Don't hijack a Ferrari if you
don't know how to drive!

568
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:47,463
Mr. Gaunt?

569
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,140
Hi, I'm Lynette Scavo.

570
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:51,803
My husband is opening the
pizzeria right down the block.

571
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:53,972
If it's about that
liquor license,

572
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:55,102
I'm not signing.

573
00:29:55,698 --> 00:29:58,072
Please, I've been at this
for hours. Just hear me out.

574
00:29:58,818 --> 00:30:01,803
Well, I never could
resist a pretty lady.

575
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:03,933
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

576
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:07,351
Did you live
in Las Vegas?

577
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,891
I was a croupier
for 40 years,

578
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:13,002
and as you can see,
I had a weakness for showgirls.

579
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,701
I bet you were
quite the player.

580
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:17,143
You have no idea.

581
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:19,462
Can I top you
off there?

582
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:21,792
No, thanks.
Two's my limit.

583
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:23,330
Well, suit yourself.

584
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:28,301
Look, I understand your
concerns about the license.

585
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:30,121
Your neighbors
had them, too.

586
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:33,802
But they signed the waiver
once I explained to them

587
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:36,182
that this is
a family restaurant.

588
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:39,300
No late nights,
no loud music.

589
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,253
If there's one thing
I learned in Vegas,

590
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:44,660
it's that booze turns most
people into noisy jackasses,

591
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,282
And I don't want 'em
puking on my doorstep.

592
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:51,201
Come on, Harry.
You are my last holdout.

593
00:30:51,928 --> 00:30:53,262
What's it gonna
take? Cash?

594
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:56,401
Free pizza for the rest
of your life? You name it.

595
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,952
Look, I hate to disappoint a
pretty lady, but I'm not signing.

596
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:04,091
Harry,

597
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,981
my husband quit his job
to start this restaurant,

598
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,862
And if we can't sell liquor,
we can't make a profit...

599
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:14,992
And whoa, whoa, whoa,
Harry. eyes up here.

600
00:31:15,737 --> 00:31:16,803
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

601
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:17,523
Sorry.

602
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,732
This place is his dream,

603
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:25,342
and if he can't make it work,
then it's just gonna kill him,

604
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,503
And consequently,
it's gonna kill our marriage...

605
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:29,281
And, Harry, Harry,
what did I say?

606
00:31:29,876 --> 00:31:32,272
I know, uh, uh,
I don't mean to be rude.

607
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:35,370
It's just that my showgirl
days were a while ago,

608
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:38,423
and I can't remember the
last time I laid eyes on a...

609
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,380
a beautiful woman's...

610
00:31:41,185 --> 00:31:41,861
bosom.

611
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:48,972
Really?

612
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,413
Well, what if
I were to...

613
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:56,051
very briefly refresh
your memory?

614
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,703
Completely worth it.

615
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:06,190
Glad you thought so.

616
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:21,473
Come on, baby. Say it one
more time for Mommy.

617
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:23,870
So you can teach 'em
to say whatever you want?

618
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,903
Oh, yes. These birds
are very bright.

619
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:27,600
I think they're smarter
than people.

620
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:31,502
Some people, anyway.

621
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:38,802
Bree! Come in.
I just made some lemonade.

622
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,082
This isn't a social call.

623
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:49,801
We need to talk.

624
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:51,553
About what?

625
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:55,301
About what it's gonna take to get
you to sell this house and move.

626
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:57,743
Move? Why?

627
00:32:58,308 --> 00:32:59,812
You're my husband's ex-wife.

628
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:02,443
You disappeared so people
would think he killed you.

629
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:05,441
Does my scomfort really need
any further explanation?

630
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:08,993
I had no idea
you felt this way.

631
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:09,903
Oh, please.

632
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,351
Orson made it perfectly clear
we don't want you here.

633
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,642
Okay, now I'm
really confused.

634
00:33:16,735 --> 00:33:18,743
When Orson came by,
all he said was,

635
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:22,093
"Welcome to the street"
and did I need help unpacking.

636
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:26,562
That's not true.

637
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:29,193
You know what?

638
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:31,700
I think I've
said too much.

639
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:33,102
How about
that lemonade?

640
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:38,130
Ma'am, where would
you like this?

641
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:40,372
Ooh, uh, upstairs.
I'll show you.

642
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:43,970
Here, drink this.

643
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:45,803
You look a little pale.
Be right back.

644
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:51,633
Don't tell Bree.

645
00:33:55,477 --> 00:33:56,391
Don't tell Bree.

646
00:34:52,488 --> 00:34:53,320
Are you all right?

647
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,302
I'm so sorry.
I br... broke a glass.

648
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:58,782
Don't worry.
I'll get it.

649
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:00,333
Well, okay...

650
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:02,123
I have to go.

651
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:05,003
Bree...

652
00:35:05,406 --> 00:35:06,081
Wait.

653
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:11,943
I understand why you might feel a little
threatened about my moving in here.

654
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,102
But in time,
you'll see I'm...

655
00:35:15,757 --> 00:35:16,941
I'm perfectly harmless.

656
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:34,103
So... how was
the mystery date?

657
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:37,140
Uh, it was fabulous.
Thanks for asking.

658
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:39,993
Oh, come on.
I want details. Who is he?

659
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,782
He's some global financier,

660
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:44,993
Saw me on the cover
of "Paris Match."

661
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:46,800
Good-looking,
just not my type.

662
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:48,201
Really?

663
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:52,230
'Cause I always thought that you and
Zach would make a really great couple.

664
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:55,233
You son of a bitch.
You were there?

665
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:57,700
Parked across the street,
laughing my ass off.

666
00:35:57,996 --> 00:35:59,553
I can't believe
you followed me.

667
00:36:01,038 --> 00:36:03,892
I thought you were meeting a psycho
killer for lunch. I was worried.

668
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:09,482
Well, at least until they brought out
the crayons and children's menus.

669
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:12,763
-All right, off my porch.
-Okay, but don't forget,

670
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:14,552
you asked me to
watch your back.

671
00:36:15,655 --> 00:36:16,833
Yeah, about that...

672
00:36:17,488 --> 00:36:19,922
I'm installing an alarm
system tomorrow, so...

673
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:22,753
I'm not gonnaeed you to
look after me anymore.

674
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:26,220
Gaby, I don't mind.

675
00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:27,580
I mind.

676
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,872
We're divorced. I can't keep running
to you every time I get scared.

677
00:36:31,797 --> 00:36:33,803
I want to be the kind of woman
who can take care of herself.

678
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:36,703
Well...

679
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:39,452
Good for you.

680
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:45,663
I'm still right
down the block,

681
00:36:47,757 --> 00:36:48,810
So if you do
need me...

682
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:52,213
I won't. But thank you.

683
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:02,470
Hi.

684
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:03,703
Hey.

685
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:05,720
You're home early.

686
00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:08,652
I'm celebrating. We got
our liquor license today.

687
00:37:10,055 --> 00:37:11,191
Really? That's great!

688
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:14,121
Yeah, Andrew said he went all over
the neighborhood getting signatures.

689
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:15,562
Good for him.

690
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:17,890
But I think he's lying.

691
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:21,041
I think somebody else
got the siatures.

692
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:26,563
Okay, let's say just for the sake of
argument, rhat someone else did,

693
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:29,131
someone who clearly
loves you very much.

694
00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:30,371
What's wrong with that?

695
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,403
Nothing. Nothing. Order has
been restored in the universe.

696
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:35,722
You saved the day.
I'm a loser.

697
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,781
Ah, come on, Tom.

698
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:41,552
I tried for two months
to get that waiver signed.

699
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:42,993
You did it in a day.

700
00:37:43,246 --> 00:37:43,992
Like I said...

701
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:46,853
You can't drown
in self-pity

702
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:49,521
just because I helped you
with one tiny little thing.

703
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:52,853
Okay, but if I tell you that
the plumbing's not up code,

704
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:55,382
that we have termites and that the chairs
won't be there until after we open,

705
00:37:55,437 --> 00:37:57,191
can I drown
in self-pity then?

706
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:01,163
Why haven't you told
me about all of this?

707
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:03,863
Because I wanted to accomplish
something on my own.

708
00:38:04,006 --> 00:38:07,090
I'm the man. I shouldn't have
to run to my wife to bail me out.

709
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:08,150
Ow!

710
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:12,330
Gambling with our life savings
and not asking for help

711
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:14,303
doesn't make
you a man.

712
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:16,532
It makes you an idiot.

713
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:19,141
Come on, Tom, for God
sakes, we are a team,

714
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:21,292
and that restaurant
is a huge undertaking.

715
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:22,503
No one could
do it alone.

716
00:38:22,588 --> 00:38:24,762
You don't ask me for help
with your ad campaigns.

717
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:25,790
Ow!

718
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:27,530
I don't have to.

719
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:31,222
You're always giving it
to me, inspiring me.

720
00:38:31,365 --> 00:38:34,353
Remember the mouthwash jingle?
You came up with the hook.

721
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:36,301
And what about
the Bartlett campaign?

722
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:38,853
Would I have ever come up
with tango-dancing fleas?

723
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:39,742
All you.

724
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:41,951
There's nothing that
I have accomplished

725
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:43,580
that I could have done
without your help.

726
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,990
Okay, fine. I help.
We're a team.

727
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:47,741
Just don't hit
me again.

728
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,861
So tomorrow, first thing,
we'll fix the plumbing,

729
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:54,613
we'll call an exterminator,
we'll rent some chairs,

730
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:58,080
and we will open on time,
and it'll be a glorious success

731
00:38:58,315 --> 00:39:02,573
that you will have achieved
with my help, okay?

732
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:04,300
Okay.

733
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:11,113
And tonight I'm gonna slap on some sex
perfume and you're gonna get naked,

734
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:12,750
and then we're gonna
see who the man is.

735
00:39:15,178 --> 00:39:16,371
God, I hope it's me.

736
00:39:16,627 --> 00:39:18,203
Oh, I'm sure it will be.

737
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:28,760
Hey, Mom. What are
you doing out here?

738
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:36,023
Okay, here's the thing-

739
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:39,300
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
get mad. Just sit down.

740
00:39:47,906 --> 00:39:49,600
You know what
upset me the most?

741
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:53,362
That you didn't trust me
enough to tell me the truth.

742
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:56,183
I tried to.
You freaked out.

743
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,210
Well, of course
I freaked out. I'm a parent.

744
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:03,862
You know, we hope that our
children will wait to have sex till...

745
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:06,001
after we're dead.

746
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:07,993
And you wonder why
I went to Edie.

747
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,273
Okay, that's the other thing.
That cannot happen anymore.

748
00:40:12,558 --> 00:40:15,700
You and I have always had
an amazing relationship.

749
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:19,193
Let's not mess
it up now.

750
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:21,510
Okay.

751
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:23,430
I'm sorry.

752
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:29,393
Look, I know you think
I'm too young, but...

753
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:31,962
Austin and I are in love.

754
00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:36,860
Yeah, um...

755
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:40,671
About that...

756
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:50,893
God, I wish there was a pill you
could take to protect your heart.

757
00:40:52,508 --> 00:40:53,231
What do you mean?

758
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:57,371
Honey, I...

759
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:00,650
I was over at
Edie's today and,

760
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,253
I walked in the door...

761
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:06,261
Uh, yes. I need to speak
to my husband.

762
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,002
Uh, yes. There he is.

763
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:11,041
Would you...

764
00:41:11,645 --> 00:41:14,463
please ask him to come home
as early as possible tonight.

765
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:15,853
Thank you.

766
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,722
It's a dangerous world...

767
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,400
So we all look
for protection...

768
00:41:31,286 --> 00:41:34,233
And whether we find it in
the arms of our mother...

769
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:41,810
Or at the end of
a jacket blade...

770
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:49,023
In the kiss of
our sweetheart...

771
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,033
Or at the end
of a barrel...

772
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:59,102
We do what we have
to, to feel safe...

773
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:05,912
Beacuse we know
somewhere in the world...

774
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:14,613
There are those who
will do us harm.
