1
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,236
If you please, ma'am!


2
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,031
There are two gentlemen and a lady
waiting upon you in the parlour.


3
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,576
One of them is Mr Darcy.


4
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,039
Thank you.
Tell them I shall come directly.


5
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,011
Mr Darcy.


6
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,559
I hope that you have not been
waiting long.


7
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,019
Not at all.


8
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,814
May I introduce my sister Georgiana?


9
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,865
Georgiana,
this is Miss Elizabeth Bennet.


10
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,619
How do you do?


11
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,370
I'm very pleased
to meet you, Miss Darcy.


12
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,248
- I've heard so much about you.
- And I about you.


13
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,000
Mr Bingley is here with us,


14
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,086
and very desirous to see you as well.
He insisted on accompanying us.


15
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,464
May I summon him?


16
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,550
Of course!
I should like to see him very much.


17
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:23,435
I understand that you are fond of music,
and play very well.


18
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,188
Oh, no. Not play <i>very</i> well.


19
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,233
I mean, but I am very fond of music.


20
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,736
I should dearly love to hear you
play and sing.


21
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,239
My brother has told me
he has rarely heard anything


22
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,491
that gave him more pleasure.


23
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,993
Well, you shall.


24
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:44,081
But I warn you, your brother
has grossly exaggerated my talents.


25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,792
No doubt for some mischievous reason.


26
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,419
Oh, no. That could not be so.


27
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,757
My brother never exaggerates.
He always tells the absolute truth.


28
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:58,136
Except that sometimes I think
he is a little too kind to me.


29
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,389
An ideal elder brother, then.


30
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:04,142
Oh, yes! I couldn't imagine
a better or a kinder one.


31
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,271
You make me feel quite envious.


32
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,274
I have no brothers at all.
Only four sisters.


33
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,985
I should have liked to have a sister .


34
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,862
(BINGLEY): Miss Bennet!


35
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:20,659
I was so delighted when Darcy told me
you were not five miles from Pemberley!


36
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,536
How do you do?


37
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,206
- I see you are well.
- Very well, thank you.


38
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,167
Good, good, excellent! And your family?


39
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,461
- Very well, sir.
- Yes?


40
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,593
Pray, tell me. Are <i>all </i>your sisters
still at Longbourn?


41
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,097
All except one.
My youngest sister is at Brighton.


42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,265
Ah.


43
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,562
It seems too long...


44
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,941
..it <i>is </i>too long, since I had
the pleasure of speaking to you.


45
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,987
- It must be several months.
- It is above eight months at least.


46
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,240
We have not met
since the 26th of November,


47
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,492
when we were dancing together
at Netherfield.


48
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,328
I think you must be right.


49
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,248
I don't think I can remember
a happier time


50
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,043
than those short months
I spent in Hertfordshire.


51
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,339
Miss Bennet, my sister has a request
to make of you.


52
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:22,596
Miss Bennet, my brother and I
would be honoured


53
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,975
if you and your aunt and uncle would be
our guests at Pemberley for dinner.


54
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,773
- Would tomorrow evening be convenient?
- Thank you, we shall be delighted.


55
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:38,362
I can answer for Mr and Mrs Gardiner.
We have no fixed engagements.


56
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:43,575
- And shall we hear you play?
- If you insist upon it, yes, you shall.

(LIZZY PLAYS THE PIANO AND SINGS)


58
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,623
(''VOI, CHE SAPETE''
FROM ''THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO'')


59
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,623
Absolutely marvellous!


60
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,674
Will you not play again?
You played that song so beautifully.


61
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,719
Not very beautifully,
not faithfully at all.


62
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,513
You must have seen
how I fudged and slurred my way


63
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,932
through the difficult passages.


64
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,854
- It's a beautiful instrument, though.
- My brother gave it to me.


65
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:58,066
- He is so good. I don't deserve it.
- I am sure you do.


66
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,405
Your brother thinks you do,
and as you know, he is never wrong.


67
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:12,539
Now, it's your turn.
Oh, I absolutely insist!


68
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,041
In front of all these people?


69
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,794
I will play,
but please don't make me sing.


70
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,962
If you like.


71
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,680
Pray, Miss Eliza, are the Militia
still quartered at Meryton?


72
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:31,641
No, they are encamped at Brighton
for the summer.


73
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,936
That must be a great loss
for your family.


74
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,024
We're enduring it
as best we can, Miss Bingley.


75
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,318
I should have thought
<i>one </i>gentleman's absence


76
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,945
might have caused particular pangs.


77
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,658
I can't imagine who you mean.


78
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,745
I understood that certain ladies
found the society


79
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,581
of Mr Wickham curiously agreeable.


80
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm so sorry. I'm neglecting you.


81
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,464
How can you play
with no one to turn the pages.


82
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,636
There, allow me.


83
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,690
(MISS BINGLEY): How very ill
Eliza Bennet looked this evening!


84
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,819
I've never seen anyone so much altered
as she is since the winter.


85
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,031
- Quite so, my dear.
- She is grown so brown and coarse.


86
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,742
Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should hardly know her.


87
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,995
What do you say, Mr Darcy?


88
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,414
I noticed no great difference.


89
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,125
She is, I suppose, a little tanned.


90
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,253
Hardly surprising
when one travels in the summer.


91
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,340
For my part, I must confess,
I never saw any beauty in her face.


92
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,970
Her features are not at all handsome.
Her complexion has no brilliancy.


93
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,848
Her teeth are tolerable, I suppose,


94
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,309
but nothing out of the common way.


95
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,773
And as for her eyes, which I have
sometimes heard called fine,


96
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,110
I could never perceive anything
extraordinary in them.


97
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,824
And in her air
there is a self-sufficiency


98
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,619
without fashion,
which I find intolerable.


99
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,120
I think...


100
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,830
When we first knew her in Hertfordshire,


101
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,250
how amazed we all were
to find her a reputed beauty!


102
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,837
I particularly recall you, Mr Darcy,


103
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,548
one night after they had been dining
at Netherfield,


104
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:14,012
saying: ''She a beauty?
I should as soon call her mother a wit!''


105
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,684
(MISS BINGLEY): But afterwards
she seemed to improve on you.


106
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,480
I even believe you thought her
rather pretty at one time.


107
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,276
Yes, I did.
That was only when I first knew her.


108
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,862
For many months now
I have considered her


109
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,531
one of the handsomest women
of my acquaintance.


110
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,844
No, no, the green one.


111
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,555
Yes, that will do.


112
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,226
Good. No, never mind that.


113
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,714
If you please, ma'am.
The post's just come.


114
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,090
Thank you, Hannah.


115
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,844
A good girl, that. Very obliging.


116
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:23,558
Two letters from Jane. At last!
I had been wondering why we hadn't...


117
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,436
This one was misdirected at first.


118
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,440
No wonder, for she wrote the direction
very ill, indeed!


119
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,944
Would you be angry
if I beg you to postpone our outing?


120
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,364
Not at all!
Of course you want to read your letters.


121
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,285
We will walk to the church
and call back in an hour .


122
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,621
Thank you, you're very kind!


123
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,139
(JANE): <i>My dearest Lizzy,</i>


124
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,559
<i>I hope your journey has been
as delightful as you anticipated.</i>


125
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,938
<i>We all miss you.
Our father most of all, I believe.</i>


126
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,398
<i>I have hardly had time to write.</i>


127
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,151
<i>My nephews and nieces
have taken almost every moment!</i>


128
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,113
<i>But they are such dear children.</i>


129
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,617
<i>Our mother indeed finds their exuberance
a little trying for her nerves.</i>


130
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:24,994
Mamma...


131
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,791
<i>She spends much of the day above stairs
in her room, or with Mrs Philips.</i>


132
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,128
<i>Dearest Lizzy, since writing the above,</i>


133
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:37,257
<i>something has occurred
of a most unexpected and serious nature.</i>


134
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,886
<i>But I'm afraid of alarming you.
Be assured we are all well.</i>


135
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,223
<i>What I have to say
relates to poor Lydia.</i>


136
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,683
Lydia!


137
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,439
<i>An express came at twelve last night,
just as we were all gone to bed.</i>


138
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:01,406
(MOTHER): Mr Bennet, what is it?
Are we to be murdered in our beds?


139
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,544
(JANE): <i>The letter
was from Colonel Forster,</i>


140
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,506
<i>to inform us that Lydia was gone off
to Scotland with one of his officers.</i>


141
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,051
<i>To own the truth... with Wickham.</i>


142
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,846
Oh, Lydia!


143
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:29,350
Oh, Mr Bennet, we are all ruined!


144
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,562
<i>You will imagine our surprise and shock.</i>


145
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:37,275
<i>To Kitty, however, it does not seem
so wholly unexpected.</i>


146
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:44,949
<i>I am very, very sorry.
So imprudent a match on both sides!</i>


147
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,202
<i>But I'm willing to hope the best,</i>


148
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,454
<i>and that his character
has been misunderstood.</i>


149
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,998
I wish I could believe it.


150
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,629
<i>His choice is disinterested at least.</i>


151
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>He must know
that our father can give him nothing.</i>


152
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,178
Yes, that is true.
But how could he do this ?


153
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,765
She is silly enough for anything.


154
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,018
But Wickham to love Lydia?


155
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,230
Marry Lydia?


156
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,691
There is one lady
I shall be very loath to part from.


157
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,618
<i>We expect them soon
returned from Gretna, man and wife.</i>


158
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,997
<i>I must conclude. I cannot be away
from our poor mother long.</i>


159
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,501
<i>I shall write again
as soon as I have news.</i>


160
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,925
<i>My dearest Lizzy, I hardly know
what to write, but I have bad news!</i>


161
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,012
<i>Imprudent as a marriage would be,
we now fear worse:


162
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,266
<i>That it has not taken place.</i>


163
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,477
<i>That Wickham never intended
to marry Lydia at all!</i>


164
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,396
Great God, I knew it!


165
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,232
<i>I cannot think so ill of him.</i>


166
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,443
I can. Poor Lydia.


167
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,321
Poor stupid girl!


168
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,869
<i>Colonel Forster said he feared
that Wickham was not to be trusted.</i>


169
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,331
(DARCY): <i>She was then
but fifteen years old.</i>


170
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,584
<i>They were traced as far as Clapham.</i>


171
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,130
<i>Father has gone with Colonel Forster
to try to discover them.</i>


172
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,427
<i>I cannot help but beg you all
to come here as soon as possible!</i>


173
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,513
Oh, yes! Where is my uncle?


174
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,520
If you please, ma'am.


175
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,399
Miss Bennet, I hope this...


176
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,860
I beg your pardon.
I must find Mr Gardiner.


177
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,698
- On business that cannot be delayed.
- Good God! What is the matter ?


178
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,494
Of course I will not detain you,
but let me go,


179
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,039
or let the servant go
and fetch Mr and Mrs Gardiner.


180
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,458
- You cannot go yourself.
- I must...


181
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,128
Come. I insist.
This will be for the best. Hello there!


182
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,465
Have Mr and Mrs Gardiner
fetched here at once.


183
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,675
- They walked in the direction of...
- ..the church.


184
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,803
Yes, sir, at once.


185
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,142
You are not well.
May I not call a doctor ?


186
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,229
No. I am well. I am well.


187
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,026
Is there nothing you can take
for your present relief?


188
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,489
A glass of wine? Can I get you one?
Truly, you look very ill.


189
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:34,619
No, I thank you. There is nothing
the matter with me. I am quite well.


190
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,955
I am only distressed
by some dreadful news,


191
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,416
which I have just received
from Longbourn.


192
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,132
- I am sorry. Forgive me.
- No, no.


193
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,722
I have just received a letter from Jane,
with such dreadful news.


194
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,309
It cannot be concealed from anyone.


195
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,690
My youngest sister
has left all her friends,


196
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,319
has eloped,


197
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,949
has thrown herself into the power...


198
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,618
..of Mr Wickham.


199
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,707
They have run away together
from Brighton.


200
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,252
You know him too well to doubt the rest.


201
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,631
She has no money, no connections,


202
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,759
nothing that can tempt him.


203
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,849
When I think
that I might have prevented it!


204
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,685
I, who knew what he was!


205
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,523
Had his character been known,
this could not have happened.


206
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,609
But it is all too late now.


207
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,321
I am grieved, indeed. Grieved, shocked.


208
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:58,035
- But is it certain? Absolutely certain?
- Oh, yes.


209
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,831
They left Brighton together
on Sunday night.


210
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,836
They were traced as far as London,
but not beyond.


211
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,839
They are certainly not gone to Scotland.


212
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,675
What has been attempted to recover her ?


213
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,344
My father has gone to London.


214
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,223
And Jane writes to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance.


215
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,644
I hope that we shall leave
within half an hour.


216
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,646
But what can be done ?


217
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,232
I know that nothing can be done.


218
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,362
How is such a man to be worked on ?


219
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,033
How are they even to be discovered?


220
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,412
I have not the smallest hope.


221
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:46,209
She is lost forever,
and our whole family must partake


222
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,336
of her ruin and disgrace.


223
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,512
I'm afraid you have long been desiring
my absence.


224
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,601
This unfortunate affair will, I fear,
prevent my sister


225
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,355
from having the pleasure
of seeing you at Pemberley today.


226
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,981
Oh, yes.


227
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:14,487
Be so kind as to apologise for us
to Miss Darcy.


228
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,034
Say that urgent business
calls us home immediately.


229
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,162
And if you would be so kind...


230
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,582
as to conceal the unhappy truth
as long as possible.


231
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,169
I know that it cannot be long.


232
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,090
You may be assured of my secrecy.


233
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,136
But I have stayed too long.
I shall leave you now.


234
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,098
Yes. Thank you.


235
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,813
Goodbye.


236
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,326
I shall never see him again.


237
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:16,632
Even if what you say of Wickham is true,
I still cannot believe this of Lydia.


238
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,176
Ever since the militia came to Meryton,


239
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,763
there's been nothing
but love and officers in her head.


240
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,224
We must not assume the worst.


241
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,519
It may yet be
that this is all a misunderstanding.


242
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,896
Or just a passing folly
that her friends can hush up


243
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,524
and will in time be quite forgotten.


244
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,820
- It is possible, Lizzy!
- Indeed it is.


245
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,531
Why would any young man
form a design against a girl


246
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,242
who is not unprotected or friendless,


247
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,621
and who is staying
in the Colonel's family?


248
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:51,167
Look at it in any way you like.
The temptation is not worth the risk.


249
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,921
Not perhaps of risking his own interest.


250
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,842
But I do believe him capable
of risking everything else!


251
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,532
You are very quiet this evening,
Mr Darcy.


252
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,620
I hope you're not pining for the loss
of Miss Eliza Bennet.


253
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,871
What?


254
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,874
Excuse me.


255
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:05,574
(THE GARDINER CHILDREN): There she is!
Mamma, mamma! Did you bring us anything?


256
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,959
- Lizzy! I am so glad to see you.
- Has anything been heard?


257
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,421
Not yet, but now that our uncle
has come, I hope all will be well.


258
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,089
F ather left for town on Tuesday,


259
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,259
and we've only heard
that he has arrived in safety.


260
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,054
Mamma has been asking for you
every five minutes.


261
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,099
- How is she?
- She has not yet left her room.


262
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,018
And you look pale.


263
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,731
Oh, Jane,
how much you must have gone through!


264
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,942
I am so happy to see you, Lizzy. Come.


265
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:44,989
Oh!


266
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,658
Oh, Lizzy!


267
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,660
Oh, brother!


268
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,414
We are all ruined forever!


269
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:58,252
If only Mr Bennet
had taken us all to Brighton,


270
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,087
none of this would have happened!


271
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,631
I blame those Forsters!


272
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,427
I am sure there was some great neglect
on their part,


273
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,181
for she is not the kind of girl
to do that sort of thing,


274
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,641
if she had been properly looked after!


275
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,978
- Mamma.
- And now here is Mr Bennet gone away.


276
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,148
I know he will fight Wickham,
and then he will be killed,


277
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,650
and then what is to become of us all?


278
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:27,448
Those Collinses will turn us out
before he is cold in his grave!


279
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,912
And if you are not kind to us, brother,
I don't know what we shall do!


280
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,582
Sister, calm down.
Nothing dreadful will happen!


281
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,796
I'Il be in London tomorrow, and we will
consult as to what is to be done.


282
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,756
Yes, yes, that is it!


283
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,552
You must find them out, and if they be
not married, you must make them marry.


284
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,388
Above all, keep Mr Bennet from fighting!


285
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,266
Mamma, I am sure
he does not mean to fight.


286
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,268
Oh yes, he does!


287
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:01,023
And Wickham will kill him for sure,
unless you can prevent it, brother!


288
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,610
You must tell him
what a dreadful state I'm in!


289
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,322
How I have such
tremblings and flutterings.


290
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:14,286
Such spasms in my side and pains
in my head and beatings at my heart,


291
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,706
that I can get no rest
either night or day!


292
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,708
Sister, calm yourself.


293
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,546
And tell Lydia not to give
any directions about wedding clothes


294
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:28,050
till she's seen me, for she does
not know which are the best warehouses!


295
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,291
(MARY): This is the most
unfortunate affair,


296
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,418
and will probably be much talked of.


297
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,837
(LIZZY): Yes, thank you, Mary.


298
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,214
I think we have all
apprehended that much.


299
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,633
We must stem the tide of malice,


300
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:14,430
and pour into each other's wounded
bosoms the balm of sisterly consolation.


301
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,267
Mary, pass the potatoes
to your aunt Gardiner.


302
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,687
- I beg your pardon?
- (KITTY): Never mind. I will.


303
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,231
Thank you, Kitty.


304
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,986
That's the first kind word I've had
from anyone since Lydia went away.


305
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,615
It is most unfair, for I have not
done anything naughty!


306
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,493
And I don't see that Lydia has done
anything dreadful either.


307
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:40,164
- Kitty, please!
- Unhappy as the event must be


308
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,292
for Lydia,
we must draw from it this useful lesson:


309
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,629
that loss of virtue
in a female is irretrievable.


310
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,506
My dear Mary, this is hardly helpful.


311
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,719
For a woman's reputation
is no less brittle than it is beautiful.


312
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,681
Therefore we cannot be too guarded
in our behaviour


313
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,851
towards the undeserving
of the other sex.


314
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,020
Yes... thank you, Mary.


315
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,376
Now, Jane... tell me everything about it
that I have not already heard.


316
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,130
What did Colonel Forster say?


317
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,219
Had they no apprehension about anything
before the elopement took place?


318
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,556
Colonel Forster did own he suspected
some partiality on Lydia's side,


319
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,643
but nothing to give him any alarm.


320
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,021
Lizzy, I feel I am to blame.


321
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,067
I urged you not to make
Wickham's bad conduct known.


322
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,903
Now poor Lydia is suffering for it.


323
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:57,408
No one else suspected him for a moment.
I am, I am to blame!


324
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,910
You are not to blame!


325
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:04,206
No more than I, or Mr Darcy
or anyone else deceived by Wickham.


326
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:09,962
You have nothing to blame yourself for.
Others are culpable, not you.


327
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,301
She wrote a note for Mrs Forster
before she went away.


328
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:26,812
''My dear Harriet, you will laugh
when you know where I am gone, ''


329
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,815
''and I can't help laughing myself
at your surprise


330
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,776
''tomorrow morning,
as soon as I am missed. ''


331
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,071
(LYDIA): <i>I'm going to Gretna Green,</i>


332
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,283
<i>and if you can 't guess with who,
I'Il think you a simpleton,</i>


333
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,077
<i>for there is but one man
in the world I love.</i>


334
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,080
<i>Don 't send them word
at Longbourn of my going.</i>


335
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,957
<i>It will make the surprise
all the greater,</i>


336
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,252
<i>when I write to them
and sign my name Lydia Wickham!</i>


337
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,757
<i>What a good joke it will be.
I can scarcely write for laughing!</i>


338
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,346
Thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!


339
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,100
What a letter to have written
at such a moment.


340
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,436
But at least she believed
they were to be married,


341
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,481
whatever he might persuade her
to afterwards.


342
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,359
Our poor father!
How he must have felt it.


343
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,363
I never saw anyone so shocked.


344
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,742
He couldn't speak for ten minutes.


345
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,079
Mother was in hysterics,
and the house was in confusion.


346
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,249
Lady Lucas has been very kind,
offering her services.


347
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,504
She had better had stayed home!


348
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,423
Assistance is impossible,
and condolence insufferable.


349
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:39,843
Let her triumph over us at a distance
and be satisfied!


350
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,470
That is unkind.


351
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,434
- I am sure she meant well.
- Yes, perhaps she did.


352
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:53,857
I am sorry.
It's just that I can't help but be...


353
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,820
Oh, Jane.


354
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,572
Jane, do you not see


355
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:05,244
that more things have been ruined by
this business than Lydia's reputation?


356
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,020
<i>I have stayed too long.
I shall leave you now.</i>


357
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,069
(THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR)


358
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,364
Come in!


359
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,743
I thought you would not be in bed yet.


360
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,465
I have been thinking about
what you said this afternoon.


361
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,303
That it is not only Lydia's reputation
that has been ruined.


362
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,556
I was angry and upset.


363
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,059
I should not have said it.
It does no good to dwell on it.


364
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,854
You meant, I suppose, that you and I,


365
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:18,650
and Mary and Kitty,
have been tainted by association.


366
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,362
That our chances
of making a good marriage


367
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:25,657
have been materially damaged
by Lydia's disgrace.


368
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,373
The chances of any of us making
a good marriage were never very great.


369
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,252
And now I should say,
they are non- existent.


370
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,173
No one will solicit
our society after this.


371
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,258
Mr Darcy made that very clear to me.


372
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,093
Mr Darcy?


373
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,597
Does he know our troubles ?


374
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:55,729
He happened upon me
a moment after I first read your letter.


375
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,192
He was very kind,
very gentleman-like...


376
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:06,573
..but he made it very clear he wanted
nothing more than to be out of my sight.


377
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,372
He will not be
renewing his addresses to me.


378
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,459
He'Il make very sure his friend
doesn't renew his to you.


379
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,254
I never expected
Mr Bingley would renew his addresses.


380
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,631
I am quite reconciled to that.


381
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,219
Surely you do not desire
Mr Darcy's attentions, do you?


382
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,639
No, no. I never sought them.


383
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,310
But you do think
he was intending to renew them?


384
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,605
You think he is still in love with you?


385
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,232
I don't know.


386
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,986
I don't know what he was two days ago.


387
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,655
All I know is that now he,


388
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:52,202
or any other respectable man,
will want nothing to do with any of us.


389
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,957
(MUSIC DROWNS ALL DIALOGUE)


390
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,018
Lord! Look who's coming!


391
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,937
- Who is it, Kitty?
- Mr Collins, of course.


392
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,232
I'm not going to sit with him
for anyone!


393
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:38,123
I had hoped to condole
with your poor father and your mother.


394
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:42,961
F ather is still in London, and mother is
not yet well enough to leave her room.


395
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,756
Ah. Ah.


396
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,472
I feel myself called on,
not only by our relationship,


397
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,891
but by my situation as a clergyman,


398
00:32:55,974 --> 00:33:00,771
to condole with you all on the grievous
affliction you are now suffering under.


399
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,106
Thank you, sir.


400
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,566
It has often been said


401
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,736
that a friend in need
is a friend, indeed, sir.


402
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,906
Yes.


403
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,327
Be assured, ladies,
that Mrs Collins and myself


404
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,580
sincerely sympathise with you
in your distress,


405
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,249
which must be of the bitterest kind,


406
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:25,170
proceeding from a cause
which no time can remove.


407
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:29,383
The death of your sister would have been
a blessing in comparison.


408
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:34,096
And it is more to be lamented,
because there is reason to suppose,


409
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,099
my dear Charlotte informs me,


410
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,644
that this licentiousness of behaviour
in your sister


411
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,939
has proceeded from a faulty degree
of indulgence,


412
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:49,194
though I am inclined to think that
her disposition must be naturally bad.


413
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:54,074
Now, howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied...


414
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,955
We are very grateful, sir, for your...


415
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,209
..in which opinion I am joined
by Lady Catherine de Bourgh


416
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:08,046
and her daughter, to whom
I have related the affair in full.


417
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:12,843
They agree with me in apprehending
that this false step in one sister


418
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,472
must be injurious
to the fortunes of all the others.


419
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:22,853
''For who'' , as Lady Catherine herself
condescendingly says,


420
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,149
''will connect themselves
with such a family?''


421
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,781
Who, indeed, sir.


422
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,495
Now, perhaps,
in view of that consideration,


423
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,874
you may feel it would be unwise
to stay any longer.


424
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,713
Well, perhaps you are right.


425
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,591
Yes, perhaps you are right,
cousin Elizabeth.


426
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,428
I always feel that a clergyman
cannot be too careful.


427
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,432
Especially one so fortunate as to enjoy


428
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,852
the condescension
and patronage of Lady Catherine.


429
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,732
Your thoughtfulness does you credit,
cousin Elizabeth.


430
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:17,449
I am very, very sorry for you all!


431
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,050
- Insufferable man!
- I suppose he means well.


432
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,219
You suppose wrongly, Jane.


433
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,305
His purpose was to enjoy our misfortunes


434
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,641
and congratulate himself
on his own happy situation!


435
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,852
I think it kind of him
to condole with us.


436
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,610
Is he gone?


437
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,071
Yes.


438
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,657
- Good!
- Forever, with any luck.


439
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:02,661
(KITTY): Here's aunt Philips!
She can tell us the news from Meryton.


440
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:06,706
- I doubt there's much we care to hear.
- Mother will be pleased.


441
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,127
Well, girls, here's a to-do.


442
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,672
Does your mother still keep to her bed?


443
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,091
No, but she keeps to her room.


444
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:20,345
Well, well, the less the servants hear
the better, I dare say.


445
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,348
Come, let me to her, Jane,


446
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,101
though Heaven knows
I have no glad tidings for her.


447
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,899
Every day I hear some new bad tale
of Mr Wickham!


448
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:37,153
Oh, Mr Wickham,
that everybody praised to the skies!


449
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:41,908
Mr Wickham, that half the town was mad
in love with. All the time a villain!


450
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,829
A very demon from hell sent to ruin us!


451
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:52,002
I have heard he's run up debts with
every reputable tradesman in the town.


452
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,461
Oh, sister!


453
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,881
- I have heard tales of gaming debts!
- Oh, sister!


454
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,883
Of drunken routs,


455
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,846
in which more things were broken
than heads and furniture, sister!


456
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,598
Oh, sister, stop!


457
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,226
Debauches, intrigues, seductions!


458
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,313
They say there's hardly a tradesman
in the town


459
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,148
whose daughters were not meddled with!


460
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,943
Now he's meddling with our dearest girl.


461
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,737
The foul fiend!


462
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,823
He shall be discovered
and <i>made </i>to marry her!


463
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:29,664
I have to say, sister, that I always
distrusted his appearance of goodness.


464
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,294
Aye, sister, so did I,
and warned the girls!


465
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:39,007
- Too smooth and plausible by half!
- But would anybody listen to me?


466
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,135
And now we are all, all ruined!


467
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:47,015
Oh, my poor girl. My poor, poor Lydia!


468
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,986
When shall we travel into Hertfordshire,
my love?


469
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:04,658
Come away from the window, dear.
When I have settled my business affairs.


470
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,787
These things always take longer
than one thinks they will.


471
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,332
- You're not unhappy, surely?
- Lord, no!


472
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,460
Just that I can't wait to see
my mother's face!


473
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,880
And my sisters' .
Kitty will be so envious!


474
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,299
How I shall laugh!


475
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,386
I hope we shall be married
from Longbourn.


476
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,764
Then all my sisters will have to be
my bridesmaids.


477
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,519
Oh, I do wish we could go out
into the town,


478
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,021
and be seen at plays and assemblies.


479
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,483
All in good time. Be patient, dear.


480
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,571
Lord, it makes me want to
burst out laughing


481
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,992
when I think that I have done
what none of my sisters has.


482
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,829
And I the youngest of them all!


483
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,921
Mother! Here is a letter
from my uncle Gardiner!


484
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:05,593
- F ather is coming home today!
- Does he bring Lydia?


485
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,097
No. He and my uncle have not yet
discovered where she is.


486
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,474
My uncle will continue
his enquiries alone.


487
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,310
Coming home without poor Lydia?


488
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:19,107
Who will fight Wickham and make him
marry her, if he comes away?


489
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:22,277
Oh, Jane, Jane, what is to become of us?


490
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,613
Oh, oh, fetch my smelling salts!


491
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,075
I feel my faintness
coming upon me again!


492
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,297
Not now, Jane. Not now, Lizzy.

495
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,867
Should I go and get father ?

He has had nothing to eat
since he came home.

Let me. You take mother her tea.


498

Well, Jane.

You look so tired, father.

It must have been
a dreadful time for you.


503
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,117
Say nothing of that.


504
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,828
Who should suffer but myself?


505
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,915
It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.


506
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,709
Oh, papa.


507
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,004
You must not be so severe upon yourself.


508
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,758
Let me, for once in my life,
feel how much I have been to blame.


509
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,179
I am not afraid of being overpowered
by the impression.


510
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,515
It will pass away soon enough.


511
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,353
Do you still suppose them
to be in London, sir ?


512
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:06,190
Yes, where else can they be
so well concealed?


513
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:09,152
Lydia always wanted to go to London!


514
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:16,200
She is happy, then. And her residence
there will probably be of some duration.


515
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,121
Lizzy.


516
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:25,543
I bear you no ill-will for being
justified in your advice to me in May,


517
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:30,965
which, considering the event,
shows some greatness of mind, I think.


518
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,470
I must take mamma her tea.


519
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,475
She still keeps her state
above stairs, does she?


520
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,312
Good. It lends such an elegance
to our misfortune!


521
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:48,942
Another time I'Il do the same.
I'Il sit in my library, in my nightcap


522
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,779
and powdering gown,
and I'Il give as much trouble as I can.


523
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,700
Or perhaps I may defer it,
till Kitty runs away.


524
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,495
I'm not going to run away.


525
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,206
If I should go to Brighton,
I would behave better than Lydia.


526
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,041
You go to Brighton?


527
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:09,170
I wouldn't trust you as near it
as East Bourne. Not for fifty pounds!


528
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,757
No, Kitty, I have at last
learnt to be cautious,


529
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,759
and you will feel the effects of it.


530
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,346
No officer is ever
to enter my house again.


531
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,683
Or even to pass through the village!


532
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:25,186
Balls will be absolutely prohibited,


533
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,605
unless you stand up
with one of your sisters!


534
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:30,400
And you are never to stir out of doors


535
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:34,195
until having spent ten minutes
every day in a rational manner.


536
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:41,035
Well, well, well,
don't make yourself unhappy, my dear.


537
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,871
If you are a good girl
for the next ten years,


538
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,916
I'Il take you to a review
at the end of them.


539
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,740
Oh, dearest,
shall we not go out tonight?


540
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,702
Can we not go to the theatre?


541
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,457
Lord! What in the world
is <i>he </i>doing here?


542
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,666
What?


543
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,961
- What a joke!
- Who is it?


544
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,922
- You'Il never guess!
- Who is it?


545
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,258
Mr Darcy.


546
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,999
(FATHER): Come in.


547
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,298
Thank you, Hill.


548
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:35,024
Hill, what is it?
Is Mrs Bennet asking for us?


549
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,984
No, ma'am.


550
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,571
I beg your pardon,
but did you know an express


551
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,782
come for master from Mr Gardiner ?


552
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:46,661
- When did it come, Hill?
- Oh, about half an hour ago, ma'am.


553
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:16,566
- Well, Lizzy?
- Papa, what news?


554
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,113
- What news from my uncle?
- Yes, I've had a letter from him.


555
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:27,243
- What news does it bring? Good or bad?
- What is there of good to be expected?


556
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,788
Perhaps you would like
to read it yourself.


557
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:36,544
Read it aloud, Lizzy.
I hardly know what to make of it myself.


558
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,005
''My dear brother,


559
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:42,466
at last I am able to send
tidings of my niece and Mr Wickham.


560
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,845
- I have seen them... ''
- It's as I hoped! They are married!


561
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:50,892
''They are not married, nor can I find
there was any intention of being so, ''


562
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,644
''but if you will perform the engagements


563
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,939
I have ventured to make for you,
they will before long. ''


564
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,066
- What engagements ?
- Read on.


565
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,653
''All that is required is to
assure your daughter


566
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,240
''her equal share of the 5,000 pounds
she will inherit, ''


567
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:10,578
''and also allow her, during your life,
100 pounds per annum. ''


568
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,124
So little ? What about Wickham's debts ?


569
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,502
Read on.


570
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:22,298
''Mr Wickham's circumstances are
not so hopeless


571
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,466
as they are generally believed to be. ''


572
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,676
- There!
- Read on, Lizzy!


573
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:28,012
''There will be some little money,


574
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:32,266
''even when all his debts are discharged,
to settle on my niece. ''


575
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,938
- I cannot believe it.
- Read on.


576
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,568
''We've judged it best that my niece
should be married from this house.


577
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:43,945
I hope you approve. ''


578
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,656
Kitty will be disappointed
not to be a bridesmaid.


579
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,950
''Send back your answer
as soon as you can,


580
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:52,870
with the explicit financial settlement.
Yours, '' etc...


581
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:59,126
How can it be possible
he will marry her for so little?


582
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,380
He must not be undeserving,
as we thought.


583
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,173
He must truly be in love with her,
I think.


584
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:08,010
You think that, Jane,
if it gives you comfort.


585
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,390
- Have you answered the letter ?
- No, but I must - and soon.


586
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:21,649
And they must marry.
Yet he is such a man.


587
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,069
Yes, they must marry.
There's nothing else to be done.


588
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,405
There are two things I want to know:


589
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:31,492
One is, how much money your uncle
laid down to bring this about;


590
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:35,997
and the other,
how am I ever to repay him?


591
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,673
I wish I had never spoken of this
to Mr Darcy.


592
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,718
Dear Lizzy,
please do not distress yourself.


593
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,512
I'm sure Mr Darcy
will respect your confidence.


594
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:56,392
I'm sure he will.
That is not what distresses me.


595
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,020
- What, then?
- I don't know!


596
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,567
How he must be congratulating himself
on his escape!


597
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,364
- How he must despise me now.
- You never sought his love!


598
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,367
Nor welcomed it when he offered it.


599
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,496
If he has withdrawn his high opinion
of you, why should you care?


600
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,540
I don't know!


601
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,543
I can't explain it.


602
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,132
I know I shall probably
never see him again.


603
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,596
I cannot bear to think
that he is alive in the world...


604
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,016
..and thinking ill of me.
