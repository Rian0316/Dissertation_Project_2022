1
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,012
Do I have 70?

2
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:08,606
Seventy. Seventy-five.

3
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:11,488
Eighty.

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,641
Eighty-five.

5
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:18,648
Ninety.

6
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:22,206
Ninety-five.

7
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,126
One hundred.

8
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:31,602
Drawn in 1934 by Leonard Wright.

9
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:36,645
The original artwork for the cover
of Black Storm, Issue One.

10
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:41,569
At £100,000.

11
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:44,127
Any more bids?

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,612
One-ten.

13
00:00:50,173 --> 00:00:51,686
One-ten.

14
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:56,130
At £110,000.

15
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:00,965
Going once, going twice.

16
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:05,008
Sold.

17
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:08,609
I can't believe we just did that.

18
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:22,607
Hello, Eddie.

19
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:24,886
I need more time.

20
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:29,003
-Time's up, I want my £10,000.
-I haven't got it.

21
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:34,812
It's these bloody grifters,
they don't pay for anything.

22
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:37,566
Then you shouldn't let them gamble
in your bar, should you?

23
00:01:37,653 --> 00:01:40,770
I mean, I am a police officer.
I've got to report it.

24
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:44,451
-You're gonna lose your license.
-But you can't.

25
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:46,565
This place is all I've got.

26
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:50,324
You ever been to prison, Eddie?

27
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:53,288
What's that?

28
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:59,732
That's counterfeit money you've
been laundering through your till.

29
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,402
Please.

30
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:07,606
I tell you what, I will settle
for some names. I want the big fish.

31
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:10,930
No. No way. I am not a grass.

32
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,962
Wrong answer, Eddie.

33
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:19,851
Okay!

34
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:29,201
There's this crew that drink in here,
they play the long con.

35
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,442
Names.

36
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:35,087
Mickey Bricks.

37
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,612
Maybe I am missing something here.

38
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,244
Only, I thought we were grifters.

39
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:32,092
-I mean we could've lifted this.
-And then what?

40
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,243
I don't know. Do our thing, don't we?

41
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,292
Work the magic.

42
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:39,007
Great plan, Danny.

43
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:43,609
It's wiped out our working capital.
We will have to raise some cash.

44
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,925
Think of it as an investment.

45
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,649
Black Storm was one of
the original superheroes, and this...

46
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:53,010
is the Mona Lisa of comic book artwork.

47
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,042
That's why we had to pay £110,000 for it.

48
00:03:57,253 --> 00:04:00,245
They say you have
to speculate to accumulate.

49
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,012
No, you know, it feels all wrong.

50
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:06,927
We should be really proud of ourselves.
For once, we did not break the law.

51
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,128
Ash, how are the auction house
blueprints looking?

52
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:21,172
It won't be easy, but it's definitely doable.

53
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:25,046
Right, we've got two weeks until
the next auction.

54
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,091
Meantime, we'll need
to raise some working capital.

55
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:38,121
But the beauty of it is, our guy can delay
the currency movement...

56
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:40,169
just long enough for us
to place a spread bet.

57
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:43,689
We've been clearing 300,
400% profit, easy.

58
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:44,842
Wow!

59
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:47,408
-That's beautiful.
-That's beautiful, but illegal.

60
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:49,165
-But foolproof?
-Completely.

61
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,042
I'm in. Definitely. Let's do it.

62
00:04:57,493 --> 00:04:58,687
Right.

63
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,650
You'd have to be an idiot not to. £25,000.

64
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:08,887
Thank you.

65
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,610
Let's see what we've got here.

66
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:15,645
Yeah. Thank you.

67
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:19,372
Beats working for a living.

68
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:26,801
Can I help you?

69
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,932
I am arresting you for fraud.

70
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:35,731
You don't have to say anything...

71
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,611
but it may harm your defense
if you do not mention when questioned...

72
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,809
something which you later
rely on in court.

73
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,812
You can go for now.

74
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:46,563
I will contact you, take a statement.

75
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:51,887
Turn around.

76
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:58,249
Okay, here's the deal.

77
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:02,011
You two can go to prison,
or I can walk out of here...

78
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,243
with the money
and we all forget this ever happened.

79
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,527
A bent copper.

80
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,448
-So much for ''Protect and Serve.''
-Brilliant.

81
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,926
You think for one second
that we are going to let you...

82
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,527
swan out of here with £25,000?

83
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:17,406
You're dreaming, missy.

84
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:20,326
I think that's exactly
what you're going to do...

85
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,962
unless Mickey here fancies
another spell inside.

86
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,132
Not particularly.

87
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:31,124
People like you, yeah,
they give the police a very bad name.

88
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:35,691
I take it we have a deal. Now, okay.

89
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:39,602
Do anything stupid, he testifies,
you two go to prison.

90
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:41,362
Got it?

91
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:55,532
You know what they say,
what goes around comes around.

92
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:58,488
Then I'd be seriously worried,
if I were you.

93
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,853
-Yours?
-Yeah, I like to draw.

94
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,570
-You are very good, aren't you?
-That's what my art teacher said.

95
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:16,121
Now, what would a couple
of grifters be doing...

96
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:20,889
with artwork worth £100,000?

97
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:23,408
Like the catalogue says,
we're auctioning it.

98
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:28,283
Yeah, I mean it's completely legit.
We got receipts, we got everything.

99
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:31,368
What's she doing?

100
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:36,887
What are you doing?

101
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:40,966
Basically you've got five seconds
to tell me the score or I torch it.

102
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:42,611
We told you. There's no score.

103
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:44,968
Yeah, we're auctioning some artwork.

104
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,287
No law against it.

105
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:54,051
-There's no score.
-You wouldn't dare.

106
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,008
All right! We will tell you! Put it out!

107
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:18,045
Now, you tell me everything...

108
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,170
or this time, it won't be a beer mat.

109
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,129
We're auctioning
the artwork this afternoon.

110
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:30,523
We needed a genuine piece because
the auction house like to authenticate...

111
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:32,331
the artwork before they sell it.

112
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,683
While it's on display at the viewing...

113
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,010
we switch the authentic artwork
for a forgery.

114
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:40,164
It's the forgery that gets auctioned.

115
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:41,766
And then on the side...

116
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,731
we sell the authentic artwork
to a rival collector.

117
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:48,523
Yeah, and we clear £100,000 profit.

118
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:53,329
You clear £50,000 profit. I get the other 50.

119
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:55,288
Fifty?

120
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:58,251
One phone call to the auction house,
you don't make a penny.

121
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,093
Now, we need the £25,000
to pay the forger.

122
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:03,208
Fair enough.

123
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,611
Don't worry, we will meet you
back here after the auction.

124
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:12,685
You know what? I think I will tag along
for the ride.

125
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,252
One condition.

126
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:17,844
Once you get your money,
tell us who sold us out.

127
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,209
What makes you think
someone sold you out?

128
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:27,970
So, where to?

129
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:30,091
We need to pick up the forgery.

130
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:36,965
Bye, Eddie.

131
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:40,166
-Everything all right, Mick?
-Absolutely fantastic.

132
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:49,846
This is great. What do you think
we should do? Tell the others?

133
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,049
No, they've got their jobs to do. So--

134
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,328
Did anyone ever tell you
it's rude to whisper?

135
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:01,164
-Do you think she's fit?
-Don't...

136
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,323
-What?
-...even think about it.

137
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,643
You know, would you have a few,
you know, if you could?

138
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,325
What do you mean, if I could?

139
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:14,206
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

140
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:15,885
-Danny, get in the back.
-You get in the back.

141
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:17,565
No, I am not getting in the back.

142
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,006
Is there a problem?

143
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:53,368
The two collectors we outbid at the last
auction won't want to lose out again.

144
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:57,810
The higher they bid,
the more profit we make.

145
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:02,130
-A little encouragement goes a long way.
-Absolutely.

146
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,606
You have any preference?

147
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,686
I'll take the geek.

148
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:18,083
Be gentle.

149
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:19,492
As a kitten.

150
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:26,530
Morning. Landlord's gas safety checks.
I need to inspect the gas appliances.

151
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:28,808
It's actually not a very good time.
I've got to leave for work.

152
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:30,292
Well, that's your problem, you see.

153
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:33,171
You're out all day, you get a buildup
of gas from a faulty appliance.

154
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:35,403
You come home,
flick on a light switch, bang!

155
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:38,803
Next thing you know, they are scraping
your brains off the pavement.

156
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:41,851
Right. Let's start with the cooker.

157
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:43,965
It's electric.

158
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:49,853
-Boiler?
-In there.

159
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:53,443
Okay, I need you to turn the hot tap
on in the bathroom while I check it.

160
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:05,692
Sad.

161
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:16,647
Excuse me.

162
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,165
I love Superman.

163
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:36,409
Although, I've always preferred him
more as Clark Kent, you know.

164
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:40,128
Strong, but vulnerable, you know...

165
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,125
those glasses.

166
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:48,763
My little nephew,
he's crazy about him as well.

167
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,532
Actually, I wanted to get him a present.

168
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:54,685
Could you help me find some other stuff,
if you are not too busy?

169
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:59,403
No, I mean, yes, I can help you.
No, I'm not too busy.

170
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,846
I'm Neil.

171
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:06,287
It's my shop.

172
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,206
What do you know about that?

173
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:18,927
Excuse me.

174
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:23,412
Yeah?

175
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:27,168
I couldn't help noticing
your auction catalogue. Snap.

176
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:30,811
You must be here for
the pop-art exhibition.

177
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,690
Yeah, I am a sucker for Lichtenstein.

178
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:35,526
-Are you a collector?
-I've been known to dabble.

179
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:39,729
Perhaps you could clear
something up for me.

180
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:42,044
What do you make of the idea...

181
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:45,330
that Lichtenstein is mocking his subjects
in his paintings?

182
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:49,292
A common misconception. May I?

183
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,689
Please, yes, of course.

184
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:58,965
What Lichtenstein's comic book
paintings show is a grown man finding...

185
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,567
meaning in junk he's supposed
to have thrown away.

186
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:04,527
They are about the energy
of adolescent fantasy.

187
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:05,602
Yes.

188
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:12,405
So, why comic books?

189
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,484
Mickey was into them when he was a kid.

190
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,565
Because there's too much security
in the traditional art world.

191
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:20,372
He was one of those specky kids.
You know, a lot of crying.

192
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:24,852
-''Please don't bully me.''
-Plus, the artwork is easier to forge.

193
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:28,323
Yeah, that's right, Mickey.
You keep telling yourself that, mate, yeah?

194
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:32,406
Who would have thought it, the great
Mickey Bricks taking the easy option.

195
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:36,332
Yeah, that's good,
coming from a parasite like you.

196
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:40,645
It's just down here on the right.

197
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,289
It's perfect. Tim will love it.

198
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:49,049
-Thanks for all your help.
-No, it was a pleasure.

199
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:51,921
Bye-bye, then.

200
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,367
Three, two, one.

201
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,722
Are you doing anything later?

202
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:20,725
There's an auction, comic book artwork.

203
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:24,122
Maybe you and your nephew
would like to come?

204
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:26,448
-We'd love to.
-Great.

205
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,048
Great.

206
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:35,286
It's the same energetic style,
bold primary colors.

207
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:38,810
The same single-mindedness
you later find in Warhol's work.

208
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,802
The comics inspired
the pop-art movement.

209
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:45,646
I'd sell my soul to own an original piece.

210
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,570
I'll let you in on a little secret.

211
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:51,851
I'll be bidding for some original artwork
at the auction.

212
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:54,522
Really? Which artist?

213
00:16:02,013 --> 00:16:05,688
Black Storm, the Mona Lisa
of comic book artwork.

214
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,884
We could go to the auction together.

215
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,490
Right, we'll need the £25,000.

216
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:20,043
-I'm coming in with you.
-No, that might not be such a good idea.

217
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:24,206
-You know what these artists are like.
-Yeah, you know, very sensitive.

218
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:26,763
Say the wrong thing and you'll crush him.

219
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,450
Don't say we didn't warn you.

220
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:35,572
For £25,000,
this forgery had better be good.

221
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:39,892
Danny, you handsome little prick.
Come here.

222
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:42,044
Not the bear hug.

223
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:48,209
-Hey, Mickey.
-How you doing?

224
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,126
Hello, gorgeous.

225
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:57,162
Max, we are in a bit of a hurry.
Max, we are really in a hurry.

226
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,488
Ladies and gentlemen, walk this way.

227
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,685
He's very up and down.

228
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:17,283
Okay. Let's play Spot the Forgery.

229
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:27,370
-Is that the dog's bollocks, or what?
-Which one is it?

230
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,850
Wow, that's brilliant.

231
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:37,369
-Max, you've excelled yourself.
-That is spot on.

232
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:40,812
Are you sure the auction house
won't spot it?

233
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:46,726
The auction house spots it,
Mickey can have his £15,000 back.

234
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,561
-Fifteen?
-Cheap at half the price.

235
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:04,331
Any more stunts like that,
and it won't be the dog's bollocks...

236
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,051
that you have to worry about.

237
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:10,284
-You two want to get a room?
-To do what?

238
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:13,252
-I think he's jealous.
-Somehow I doubt it.

239
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,843
Now, what happens to the other £10,000?

240
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,491
Take a wild guess.

241
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,248
Well done, Romeo.

242
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,452
Okay, what's next?

243
00:18:36,093 --> 00:18:37,492
There are some things I need to do.

244
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:39,928
Why don't you take him
and the artwork back to the bar?

245
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,492
''Him''? I am here, you know.

246
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:43,325
What can I possibly do
without the artwork?

247
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,846
Yeah, you tell me.

248
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:48,649
I tell you what, why don't you stay
with her, yeah?

249
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,691
I'll go and pick the stuff up.

250
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:55,968
Okay, watch my lips.
We stick together. You got it?

251
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:00,889
Anyway, I am really not in
the mood for Eddie's whining.

252
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:02,282
Eddie?

253
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,532
Wait. Eddie put you on to us.

254
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:09,247
Eddie? Eddie, Eddie's Bar, Eddie?

255
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:13,728
Eddie did this. I'm gonna kill him,
I will kill him.

256
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:20,328
Get over it.
Eddie's just saving his skin, like you.

257
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,166
He's nothing like us.

258
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:26,082
God, you really overdo the whole
''honor among thieves'' business.

259
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:28,812
I mean, want to do
the honorable thing, go straight.

260
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:32,602
That's good, isn't it? That's good,
coming from a bent cop.

261
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:36,170
-I don't pretend there's any honor in it.
-That's because you can't.

262
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:38,608
I'll just check if there's any mail for me.

263
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,687
You running a bit late, ain't you?
How's Max?

264
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:53,012
-The forgery okay?
-Ash.

265
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,366
-Who's she?
-Detective Inspector Phillips.

266
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:04,684
-Eddie sold us out.
-Eddie? Who told you that?

267
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,725
No, she's lying. He wouldn't.

268
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:10,881
I mean, not Eddie.

269
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,841
Are these the blueprints
for the auction house?

270
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:17,208
Think of me as your silent partner.

271
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,329
How are you handling the CCTV?

272
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:27,086
Security system's due
for its quarterly service.

273
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,843
That includes the CCTV.

274
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:34,682
I'll rig the tapes so they will be running,
they just won't record anything.

275
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:37,733
Is that the modified case
for switching the artwork?

276
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:40,248
Yeah. It's good to go.

277
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:43,962
The back of the frames match the case.

278
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:46,929
Now, while Mickey distracts everyone...

279
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:50,165
you press the other side of
the case against the original...

280
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:53,171
you clip it on, you flip the case over...

281
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:58,524
the forgery releases, and off you go.

282
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:03,445
Yeah, piece of cake.

283
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:10,972
Piece of cake.

284
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:13,408
You will have security down on you
like a ton of bricks.

285
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:14,892
Listen, maybe you should do it.

286
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:19,489
Yeah, does everyone want to chill out,
okay? I'll do it, okay? I'm going to do it.

287
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,804
-You just look after your end.
-No one's worried about my end.

288
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:26,932
Mickey, maybe you should find yourself
a nice girl and all that will change.

289
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:29,650
Been a while, has it, Mickey?

290
00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:33,210
Yeah, what can I say? I'm very choosy.

291
00:21:33,813 --> 00:21:35,769
You need to get down
to the auction house.

292
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:38,242
Yeah. I will call when I've rigged the CCTV.

293
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,403
You don't want to set foot
in there before then.

294
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:41,642
Keep practicing, Danny.

295
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,531
Next time. Go straight on, all right.
It's not a problem.

296
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:46,525
And distraction.

297
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,846
Like I said, Mickey, it is a piece of cake.

298
00:21:57,813 --> 00:21:59,132
Okay, we got to go.

299
00:21:59,213 --> 00:22:03,729
Yeah, hang on a minute, a little bit of
appreciation for that wouldn't go amiss.

300
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:06,122
You pull this off, I'll give you an ice cream.

301
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:33,763
You all right in the back, Mickey?
Got enough room for your little legs?

302
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:41,242
-Take the next right.
-Right. You mad? It's straight on.

303
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,801
Turning right avoids the one-way system.
Take a right.

304
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:45,724
Don't listen to him, love, straight on.

305
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,608
-Actually, where are we?
-Manor Road.

306
00:22:52,653 --> 00:22:55,406
Right, yeah, it is right. Take the next right.

307
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:57,811
Danny, shut up.

308
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:12,173
-Why are we stopping?
-I'll be two minutes.

309
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:16,212
-Doing what?
-We don't have time for this.

310
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:18,212
Okay, here's the deal.

311
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:21,126
We keep one set of artwork each
as security.

312
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:24,012
-Are you having a laugh?
-Why don't we just come with you?

313
00:23:24,093 --> 00:23:26,561
You wait here.
I will take the genuine piece.

314
00:23:32,973 --> 00:23:35,487
Like you said, we don't have time for this.

315
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:43,210
Great, thank you.

316
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,890
Weren't planning on going anywhere,
were you?

317
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,487
No, the thought
hadn't even crossed my mind.

318
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:55,611
Has anyone ever told you you're paranoid?

319
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:58,161
Yep, I will take your phones, too...

320
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,564
just in case you were tempted to make
any arrangements behind my back.

321
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:05,885
I would give it, but I mean, me Nan said
she might call today. She gets very Ionely.

322
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,848
Yeah, if me Nan calls...

323
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:18,451
just tell her I'll come
and see her tomorrow.

324
00:25:19,613 --> 00:25:21,888
Did you get what you needed?

325
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:25,646
It's still there, Danny.

326
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:34,689
So, your boyfriend work round here,
does he?

327
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:39,613
You got a boyfriend? No?

328
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:42,531
What, you're more of a cat person?

329
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:51,163
Hey, stop them !

330
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:53,084
Give our bag back, pricks!

331
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:55,928
Hey, stop that car!

332
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:00,128
Great.

333
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:02,408
-You call that running?
-Yes, I call that running.

334
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,643
-Where were you?
-Right behind you.

335
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:07,645
-lf I knew you were going to slow down--
-Look, it's not my fault.

336
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,689
-Do not make this my fault.
-It is your fault!

337
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:11,809
You let some idiot take the case
and it's my fault?

338
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:13,531
-Shut up!
-I've had it up to here with you.

339
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,366
-Always got to have things your own way.
-Let's sort it out now!

340
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:18,011
Shut up, Danny, and get in the car!

341
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,610
Is that supposed to mean something?

342
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:27,571
We just got screwed, all right?
That was the real artwork.

343
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:32,006
Do we really have to go through
the whole me phoning the auction house...

344
00:26:32,093 --> 00:26:35,449
you stopping me at the last minute thing?
I mean, we can if you like.

345
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:39,842
Told you she wouldn't go for it.

346
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,322
I didn't see you coming up
with any better ideas.

347
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:44,244
When exactly did you arrange it?

348
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:47,131
I left a note for Ash at the hotel,
when I checked my mail.

349
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:49,972
You can't blame us for trying, can you?

350
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:54,046
Yeah, well, I'd probably be more worried if
you weren't trying to ditch me, I suppose.

351
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,532
Here you go.

352
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:58,566
Where's he taking the artwork?

353
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,969
Did you really think we wouldn't find out?

354
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:09,602
What's that? You're sorry?
Well it's too late, son, isn't it?

355
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:15,052
Did she buy it?

356
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:21,087
Let him go.

357
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:25,486
I said, let him go.

358
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:32,447
Mickey, I'm sorry.
She was trying to blackmail me.

359
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:36,450
She planted some counterfeit money.
She told me I was going to prison.

360
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,967
You'll wish you had
when we get through with you.

361
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,053
Mickey, please. How long have we
known each other?

362
00:27:42,373 --> 00:27:43,965
I didn't have any choice.

363
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:46,562
Danny?

364
00:27:46,813 --> 00:27:49,566
Jesus, Eddie, you're making me want
to kick you.

365
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:53,328
I believe we have an auction to go to.

366
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:55,926
What about him?

367
00:27:57,653 --> 00:28:01,009
What you do after I get my money,
that's your business.

368
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:02,647
We had a deal.

369
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:07,052
-You can't do this!
-Later, Eddie.

370
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,132
I slipped.

371
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:36,010
-A slice of history.
-And where is it?

372
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:38,688
It's not arriving till later this afternoon.

373
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:41,681
I didn't expect to get another shot at it
so soon.

374
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:44,890
-Are you expecting much competition?
-Only the geek.

375
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,563
Neil Davis. Comic book collector.

376
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:51,122
Thinks it's all about
the mythology of the characters.

377
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,647
No appreciation of
the artistic significance.

378
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,122
I mean he couldn't even spell Lichtenstein.

379
00:28:57,773 --> 00:29:01,482
Then it would be a tragedy
if he acquired such an important piece.

380
00:29:01,813 --> 00:29:04,088
I will just have to make sure
that he doesn't.

381
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:13,085
Hi. You made it.

382
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,042
Here.

383
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:18,885
-You didn't have to do that.
-Yeah, I wanted to.

384
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,491
And who's this?

385
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,922
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's....

386
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:34,848
This is Tim. Say hello to Neil, Tim.

387
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:38,206
He absolutely loves his costume.
Wouldn't take it off.

388
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,646
I wish I'd got one.

389
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,369
Maybe some other time?

390
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,051
-Shall we go in?
-Yeah.

391
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:04,123
He's really excited.

392
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:20,012
Right, he'll be a while.
So let's take the weight off.

393
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,522
So, what is it we are looking at?

394
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,932
The original artwork for the cover
of Black Storm, Issue One, when it arrives.

395
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:37,411
And I take it this is a big deal?

396
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:38,568
Yeah.

397
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:41,963
He was one of the very first superheroes.
Massively influential.

398
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:45,003
Shaped the future of comics
as we know them.

399
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:47,892
-Wow.
-I'm bidding for it.

400
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,565
And who's that?

401
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:57,690
Gideon Sturock. The competition.

402
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:01,482
Looks like a pretentious little prat to me.

403
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,250
He calls himself an art collector.

404
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:07,607
He doesn't care about the characters
or the mythology.

405
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:10,325
It's just another trophy to him.

406
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:14,168
I hope you are not going
to let him buy it, then?

407
00:31:14,253 --> 00:31:15,891
Not if I can help it.

408
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:21,241
-The geek.
-Really?

409
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:25,082
Who's that rather attractive
young woman with him?

410
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:28,372
If she's with a loser like that,
probably a hooker.

411
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:38,371
I'm very much going to enjoy seeing
the look on his face when you outbid him.

412
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:44,852
Good work, Ash.

413
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:50,049
CCTV's rigged. We're on.

414
00:31:55,093 --> 00:31:56,651
You two go ahead, all right?

415
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,448
Is there a problem?

416
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:02,526
You are about to commit a crime.
Obviously I can't be associated with that.

417
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:03,882
Okay.

418
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:11,643
Get yourself a nice a cup of tea,
yeah? Sticky bun, all right?

419
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:18,323
Danny, I will be right behind you.
Now, you don't talk to me...

420
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:20,608
you don't acknowledge me,
you don't know me...

421
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:22,684
but you stay in sight. Clear?

422
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:50,206
What time does it start, 3:30?
Okay, is that any good?

423
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:52,767
Colossal.

424
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,887
-What's he doing here?
-How the hell am I supposed to know?

425
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:25,362
-What is going on?
-Master planner here screwed up.

426
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:26,932
The auction house
usually have an expert...

427
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:28,412
come in and authenticate the artwork...

428
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:30,643
-before they put it up for auction.
-Yeah, you knew that.

429
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:33,611
Yes, I did, but this is not their usual guy.

430
00:33:33,693 --> 00:33:35,763
The guy they've brought
in rumbled us six months ago...

431
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:37,571
when we tried to sell
a forged Andy Warhol print.

432
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:39,689
Yeah, we had these tins of Spam.

433
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:41,843
We'd had them all stacked up.
They were cute.

434
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:44,572
We cannot put the artwork up
for auction with him there.

435
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:46,485
We are going to have to postpone.

436
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:49,242
Just till I'm out of the way.
Deeply convenient.

437
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,608
Would you like us to step outside
and prove it to you?

438
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:53,172
All right, what about Ash? Yeah.

439
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:55,528
We will get him all, you know,
disguised, he can do it.

440
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,763
No, he's been servicing their CCTV.

441
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:02,169
-We'll have to get someone else, then.
-Danny, there is no time. Sorry.

442
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:06,690
-I'm calling it off.
-No, we can't rig the CCTV a second time.

443
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:09,924
Buyers are ready. Everybody's in place.
Got to go now.

444
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:14,323
-I could do it.
-Yeah, right. I don't think so.

445
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:16,529
Yeah. She can do it.

446
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:18,444
And watch her disappear
with the money afterwards.

447
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:19,602
Are you out of your mind?

448
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:22,571
We still make the switch. Yeah?
We still got the original.

449
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:24,609
I mean, that could work.

450
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:29,008
I guess you're gonna have to trust me.

451
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:43,241
All right, the auction house
are expecting a Mr. Henshaw.

452
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,928
I'll call and tell them that my PA will
be delivering the artwork instead of me.

453
00:34:47,013 --> 00:34:50,323
Wait until I am back in the foyer
before you make the switch, all right?

454
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:52,973
I don't want to be anywhere
near you when you do it.

455
00:34:57,413 --> 00:34:59,005
Mr. Williams, please.

456
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:24,251
Hello, I'm Mr. Henshaw's PA.

457
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:26,532
I think you are expecting me.

458
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:34,962
So, I understand your own expert
isn't in today?

459
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:37,442
Paul? No, he called in sick this morning.

460
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,888
We had to get David in here
at the last minute.

461
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:46,251
-It's authentic.
-Best get this on display.

462
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:52,252
I know Mr. Henshaw has a plane to catch,
so I will issue you with a banker's draft...

463
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,325
-immediately after the sale.
-Great. Thank you.

464
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:22,771
Something tells me you are going
to be horribly disappointed.

465
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,722
We'll just have to see
about that, won't we?

466
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:27,408
Pretty girl.

467
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,450
How much does she charge?

468
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:34,282
Yeah.

469
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,728
We're on.

470
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:25,964
Mama !

471
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:34,168
Kids. Who'd have them?

472
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,452
I've got four.

473
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:40,970
Great, I love them.
They as good-Iooking as their mom?

474
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:47,525
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you could please take your seats...

475
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,524
we will get today's auction underway.

476
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:53,687
We start with the resale of a piece
that was purchased two weeks ago...

477
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,809
at this very auction house.

478
00:37:56,493 --> 00:37:59,644
Lot Number One is the original artwork...

479
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:03,362
for the cover of Black Storm, Issue One.

480
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:08,167
Drawn in 1934 by Leonard Wright,
it's a landmark piece...

481
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:12,169
both culturally and artistically.

482
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:19,369
I'll open the bidding at just £60,000.

483
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,611
Sixty. Sixty-five.

484
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:27,282
Seventy.

485
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,247
Seventy-five.

486
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:35,688
Eighty. At £80,000.

487
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:38,207
Eighty-five.

488
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:41,521
Ninety.

489
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:44,852
Ninety-five.

490
00:38:45,853 --> 00:38:47,684
At ninety-five.

491
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,492
One hundred.

492
00:38:50,973 --> 00:38:54,204
At £100,000.

493
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:00,006
One-five.

494
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,086
One-ten.

495
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:11,091
One-fifteen.

496
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,364
Regret is a terrible thing.

497
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:23,767
One-twenty.

498
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:28,483
At £120,000.

499
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,531
Any more bids?

500
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:39,772
Going once.

501
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,012
Going twice.

502
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:47,092
Don't bid.

503
00:39:55,053 --> 00:39:56,122
Sold!

504
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:05,772
Minus our commission, that's £108,000.

505
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:11,361
Did you get it?

506
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:17,932
-You little beauty.
-I will cash it and give you your half.

507
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:23,091
You know what?
That doesn't really work for me.

508
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:25,881
Excuse me?

509
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:28,683
Did she just say what I think she said?

510
00:40:29,453 --> 00:40:33,526
Fraud, deception, assaulting a bartender.

511
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:36,491
I mean you two have racked up
quite a charge sheet, haven't you?

512
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:39,133
Don't forget you've been
with us every step of the way.

513
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:40,202
Me?

514
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:42,331
I am an undercover police officer.

515
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:44,404
Of course I've been
with you every step of the way.

516
00:40:44,493 --> 00:40:46,848
I mean, how else would I obtain evidence?

517
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:49,169
Why don't you just be
a good little girl, yeah?

518
00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:50,732
Hand it over?

519
00:40:52,893 --> 00:40:55,043
Play nice, Danny.

520
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:58,329
Now, same deal as before.

521
00:40:58,413 --> 00:41:00,973
I keep the money or you go to prison.
What's it to be?

522
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:09,168
I tell you what, you keep
the original artwork, cover expenses.

523
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:11,531
Are we supposed to be grateful?

524
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:13,844
I really don't care what you are.

525
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:16,845
Now I am going to walk out that door,
you are going to leave it...

526
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,447
ten minutes, then you're free to go.

527
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:22,402
What, and you really think
that's going to happen?

528
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:26,570
Trust me, Danny, you really
wouldn't suit prison overalls, mate.

529
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:29,201
Me? I look good in anything.

530
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,728
You, I will see around.

531
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,682
That's a very, very bad move.

532
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,964
Simply magnificent.

533
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:56,002
Excuse me.

534
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:03,484
-That's rather odd.
-What's that?

535
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:07,566
Black Storm's wearing a signet ring.
I don't recall seeing that before.

536
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:15,452
Max, we need one identical copy
and then another copy with a small flaw.

537
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:17,607
A flaw?

538
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,444
What sort of thing did you have in mind?

539
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,732
Oh, my God.

540
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:47,288
-Wait a minute, where are you, hello?
-Sorry.

541
00:42:49,093 --> 00:42:51,163
-Right. Okay.
-Sorry.

542
00:43:00,013 --> 00:43:01,332
Miss Jackson.

543
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:08,602
It appears that the artwork
you put up for sale is, in fact, a forgery.

544
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,172
The police are on their way.

545
00:43:10,773 --> 00:43:14,209
Right. D.I. Phillips.
I am working undercover.

546
00:43:14,773 --> 00:43:16,809
The suspects are still inside, all right?

547
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:20,488
We've worked with the police before.
They've always notified us in the past.

548
00:43:21,053 --> 00:43:25,126
-We couldn't, for operational reasons.
-We? Where's your backup?

549
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:27,404
I'm working on my own today.

550
00:43:28,213 --> 00:43:30,124
Why don't we discuss this inside?

551
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:35,167
What are you doing? I am a police officer.

552
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:39,332
Feel good, big man, does it?
Get your hands off me!

553
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:03,809
D.I. Cole, this is D.S. Martin.

554
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:08,405
I've been working the inside with
this crew for the last couple of months.

555
00:44:08,773 --> 00:44:10,968
Tell us why you put
the artwork up for sale.

556
00:44:11,173 --> 00:44:12,765
The art expert knew them.

557
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:15,492
It was the only way I could get
them to go through with it.

558
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:18,725
Look, their names are,
just remember this, all right...

559
00:44:18,813 --> 00:44:23,648
Michael Stone, Danny Blue,
and Ash Morgan. Check Mickey's record.

560
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:30,243
Okay. She checks out. Sorry.

561
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:33,608
Thanks to you, they've got away,
and my cover's blown.

562
00:44:33,693 --> 00:44:35,046
How was I to know?

563
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,601
The ID and artwork could've
both been forgeries.

564
00:44:37,693 --> 00:44:39,251
So, what's the scam?

565
00:44:39,493 --> 00:44:44,009
Look, they switched the authentic artwork
for a forgery while it was on display.

566
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:47,365
-I take it you have CCTV here?
-Won't help.

567
00:44:47,613 --> 00:44:49,490
Ash Morgan posed as an engineer.

568
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:52,246
He rigged the CCTV,
so it recorded absolutely nothing.

569
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:54,804
We haven't had an engineer here today.

570
00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:58,483
I personally authorize all maintenance.
I would've known if we had.

571
00:45:00,453 --> 00:45:02,125
Why don't we take a look at it?

572
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,567
Like I said, it's working perfectly.

573
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:18,802
This guy Ash didn't leave
the auction room.

574
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:22,525
Look, he prepared a fake ID.
I mean I saw it, so....

575
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:24,447
Even with a fake ID...

576
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:27,923
there is no way he would've got
anywhere near the CCTV system.

577
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:35,092
There you go. That's them.
Mickey, the black guy.

578
00:45:35,173 --> 00:45:36,731
He was using the name Henshaw.

579
00:45:36,813 --> 00:45:39,850
He bought the artwork from you,
like, about two weeks ago.

580
00:45:40,053 --> 00:45:43,363
That's not Mr. Henshaw.
Mr. Henshaw's white.

581
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:44,722
One-ten.

582
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:48,531
It's not the other guy, either.

583
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:55,088
There, now, I follow them, okay.

584
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:57,045
Go to the camera in the stairwell.

585
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:59,842
There are no cameras in the stairwell.

586
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:06,364
If the CCTV's working,
you will see them switch the artwork.

587
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:15,250
Nope, they didn't go anywhere near
the Black Storm artwork.

588
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,971
Wait, you know, they must have.

589
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:21,770
I can see you near it.

590
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:26,889
-What's happening now?
-That's nothing.

591
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,324
Some kid let go of his balloons.

592
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:02,652
So the only time we lose sight of the
artwork, you're standing right next to it.

593
00:47:07,093 --> 00:47:11,962
-What's in the case?
-Nothing. It was empty.

594
00:47:12,053 --> 00:47:15,523
I still had it from when I delivered
the artwork for them.

595
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:19,649
So, I understand your own expert
isn't in today.

596
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:21,923
Paul? No, he called in sick this morning.

597
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:25,683
Okay, I need you to turn the hot tap
on in the bathroom while I check it.

598
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:53,807
Sorry, pal.

599
00:48:01,733 --> 00:48:03,291
Where's the case now?

600
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,850
I gave it back to Mickey and Danny.

601
00:48:07,173 --> 00:48:09,733
Where were Mickey and Danny
when we lost the picture?

602
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:14,524
In the foyer, nowhere near
the Black Storm artwork.

603
00:48:19,453 --> 00:48:21,728
You do still have
the banker's draft, don't you?

604
00:48:21,813 --> 00:48:23,769
Yeah, of course.

605
00:48:49,453 --> 00:48:53,082
The woman and the kid with the balloons.

606
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:56,768
So, what's this?
Maybe we should check this out.

607
00:48:59,293 --> 00:49:00,806
I've got other evidence.

608
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:07,247
Listen, they were running a con
on some estate agent. Here you go.

609
00:49:07,773 --> 00:49:10,241
Richard Shaw, all right?
That's the guy they were conning.

610
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,642
He will totally back up my story.

611
00:49:13,853 --> 00:49:17,050
You'd have to be an idiot not to. £25,000.

612
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:27,685
Richard Shaw. Estate agent?

613
00:49:28,373 --> 00:49:29,852
I don't think so.

614
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:39,572
Look, I can take you to the forger's studio.

615
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:54,363
Okay. Let's play Spot the Forgery.

616
00:49:57,293 --> 00:49:59,648
I told you, they planted the key on me.

617
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:02,725
How come the safe deposit box
is registered in your name?

618
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,609
Blueprints for the auction house.

619
00:50:32,853 --> 00:50:34,525
Research on Black Storm.

620
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:40,605
And there's got to be £10,000 here.

621
00:50:41,093 --> 00:50:43,163
What happens to the other £10,000?

622
00:50:43,533 --> 00:50:45,012
Take a wild guess.

623
00:50:49,693 --> 00:50:51,251
They steered me here.

624
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:54,211
But it's your safe deposit box.
It's registered to you.

625
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:58,411
Yeah, but they knew I'd see
the safe depository when we drove past.

626
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:02,686
-Actually, where are we?
-Manor Road.

627
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:06,291
Right, yeah, it is right. Take the next right.

628
00:51:13,813 --> 00:51:15,531
They must have known I had a box here.

629
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:17,888
And how would they get
inside your safe deposit box?

630
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:00,446
It's counterfeit.

631
00:52:06,173 --> 00:52:07,686
What's this, then?

632
00:52:11,853 --> 00:52:13,047
Eddie.

633
00:52:15,293 --> 00:52:16,851
She's this bent D.I.

634
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:20,686
She caught Billy and his crew
gambling down here, you know...

635
00:52:20,773 --> 00:52:22,092
they were playing poker.

636
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:25,406
She wants £10,000, or I lose me license.

637
00:52:26,253 --> 00:52:28,005
And I could lose everything, Mick.

638
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:33,486
-Are you thinking what I am thinking?
-Yup.

639
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,046
Is she fit?

640
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:47,406
-Okay, I can take you to their hotel.
-It's not illegal to stay in a hotel.

641
00:52:47,493 --> 00:52:50,530
-Yeah, but we can get a search warrant.
-On what grounds?

642
00:52:50,893 --> 00:52:53,805
Mickey and Danny didn't put
the artwork up for sale, you did.

643
00:52:54,253 --> 00:52:56,164
You collected the banker's draft.

644
00:52:56,773 --> 00:53:00,448
As far as we can tell, they didn't switch
the artwork, either, whereas you....

645
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:05,285
-There's CCTV footage, witnesses.
-Look, all this. Everything, the lot, okay?

646
00:53:05,373 --> 00:53:07,933
It's all Mickey and Danny.

647
00:53:08,013 --> 00:53:10,129
There's no evidence you
even spoke to them.

648
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:14,081
There's no Max the Forger.
There's no Richard Shaw.

649
00:53:14,893 --> 00:53:17,930
This Mickey and Danny don't appear
to have done anything illegal.

650
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:19,731
At least not today, anyway.

651
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:23,331
-Where did all this come from?
-They planted it.

652
00:53:25,013 --> 00:53:29,723
-They are setting me up.
-Can you prove it?

653
00:53:32,053 --> 00:53:34,044
I don't have any choice. I'm sorry.

654
00:53:34,453 --> 00:53:39,163
Samantha Phillips. I am arresting you
on suspicion of theft, fraud, and deception.

655
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:41,611
You do not have to say anything...

656
00:53:41,693 --> 00:53:44,651
but it may harm your defense if you do
not mention when questioned...

657
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:46,724
something which you later
rely on in court.

658
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:49,452
Come on, cards on the table.

659
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:52,328
Would you have a little knock-about
with her?

660
00:53:53,933 --> 00:53:55,605
Like I said, Danny, I'm very choosy.

661
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:58,048
Yeah, but choosy ain't
getting you nowhere.

662
00:53:59,293 --> 00:54:02,808
When she got that truncheon out,
did it for me.

663
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,847
Women are your kryptonite.

664
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:09,444
What are you on about, what are you on?
Are you tripping or something?

665
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:12,001
I'm their kryptonite. Albert, I.... Listen.

666
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:16,170
-Women are powerless to resist me.
-Yeah, dream on.

667
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:17,965
-Right, I'll drive you.
-No, I'm driving.

668
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:19,452
Let me drive.

669
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:24,684
Would you open the door for me, please?

670
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:29,166
-Want us to do everything, yeah?
-Thank you.

671
00:54:33,573 --> 00:54:36,724
I didn't want to drive, okay?
So I tricked you, so I won.

672
00:54:36,813 --> 00:54:38,929
You drive, I am not driving. Forget it.

673
00:54:45,173 --> 00:54:46,652
But, Dad.

674
00:54:47,973 --> 00:54:50,931
-Always a pleasure.
-Here you go, your first score.

675
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:53,969
-Is that all?
-Shut up.

676
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:56,647
-He's learning fast.
-I'll see you around, guys.

677
00:54:58,613 --> 00:54:59,966
-Thank you.
-Nice working with you.

678
00:55:00,053 --> 00:55:01,691
Come on, let's get you home.

679
00:55:14,373 --> 00:55:17,171
-Eddie, what happened?
-I slipped.

680
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:22,569
Yeah, I didn't have time to fit
the padding before you got to the bar.

681
00:55:22,973 --> 00:55:25,203
Yeah, I couldn't exactly
say anything, could I?

682
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:27,329
Grifting's a dangerous game, Eddie.

683
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,132
But look on the bright side...

684
00:55:29,213 --> 00:55:31,681
at least D.I. Phillips
won't be bothering you anymore.

685
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:34,364
Yeah, nice one. Thanks, fellas.

686
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:41,368
So, I cashed the banker's draft
we got from the auction house.

687
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:45,809
The money's in here, along
with the £80,000...

688
00:55:45,893 --> 00:55:48,691
that Neil very happily paid for the original.

689
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:51,124
Dangerous, but lucrative.

690
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:53,443
So does this mean you lot
are going to settle your tab?

691
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:54,886
-Eddie.
-Charming.

692
00:55:54,973 --> 00:55:56,645
-Where's the gratitude?
-No appreciation.

693
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:58,405
Makes you wonder why we bother.

694
00:55:58,493 --> 00:56:00,051
All right, then, here.

695
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:06,002
Okay then, I'd better be off.

696
00:56:06,093 --> 00:56:07,082
Hold on.

697
00:56:07,453 --> 00:56:09,205
Where are you going all dressed up?

698
00:56:10,173 --> 00:56:14,291
I don't think that's,
any of your business, Danny.

699
00:56:15,053 --> 00:56:17,692
-She's got a date.
-A date? Who with?

700
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:21,401
I don't think that's any
of your business, either.

701
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:24,411
-Neil.
-Neil. Neil?

702
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:30,125
You are going out with some
specky comic-book geek, when...

703
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:35,368
a beautiful, friendly, funny,
sensitive, creative guy...

704
00:56:35,453 --> 00:56:37,808
like me doesn't even get a look in?

705
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,528
Looks that way. Doesn't it, Danny?

706
00:56:42,413 --> 00:56:44,881
Okay, guys, don't wait up.

707
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,086
Cards, gentlemen?

708
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:51,733
Cards? Yeah, brilliant.

709
00:56:53,173 --> 00:56:55,482
I can hardly handle the excitement.

710
00:57:05,613 --> 00:57:06,602
What?

711
00:57:07,013 --> 00:57:09,527
Shall we say, a tenner a hand?

712
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:14,288
-No. No way.
-Eddie, come on.

713
00:57:14,413 --> 00:57:15,732
Just a bit of fun.

714
00:57:15,973 --> 00:57:18,123
Besides, you're one of the crew now.

715
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:25,808
So, Eddie, what do you got?

716
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:30,852
Like I'd tell you lot.

717
00:58:27,693 --> 00:58:29,046
English
