1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,640
Come on, Albert!

2
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,639
Mickey Bricks, if you've
ever been brilliant,

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,240
please be brilliant now.

4
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,440
Gentlemen! I know what
you're thinking...but, er...

5
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,159
I guess...

6
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,399
most of you must
have thought that...

7
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,880
one day it would end like this...

9
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,699
- Oh, you did not just say that!
- It is a well known fact.

10
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,260
- Well known by who?
- Everyone. - Not me.

11
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,120
- That's because you're a bird.
- Mickey?

12
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,759
Leave me out of this.

13
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,659
How can you say women are
more argumentative than men?

14
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,679
- Because it's a well-known fact.
- No it is not. - See?

15
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,838
- See what? - I mentioned that women
are more argumentative than men,

16
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,339
and you've done nothing
but argue since.

17
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,659
- I was discussing.
- What's the difference?

18
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,299
One is arguing and the other one....

19
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,699
isn't.

20
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,459
Way to go, sis.
You baffled him with logic...

21
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,619
He knows what I mean. Eddie,
do you think I'm argumentative?

22
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,099
- You are a bit, yeah.
- No, I'm not. I wasn't arguing.

23
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,739
No, she was discussing, you see.

24
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,819
- Yeah, they do a lot of that, birds.
- Yeah, they do...mmm. Mmm.

25
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,779
Oh, all right.

26
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,539
You can be so annoying,
really...all of you.

27
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,780
Well, looks like you were right,
he arrived last evening.

28
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,220
Who did?

29
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,380
Our new mark.

30
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,539
Madani Wasem.

31
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,659
Came to London in the '80s to
re-trace his father's footsteps

32
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,619
and accept a place
at Oxford University.

33
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,619
He graduated with a degree in
economics before returning

34
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,299
to Bahrain to take his place on the
board of his father's company,

35
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,619
The Gulf Partnership.

36
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,980
Wasem was with friends when he heard
of his father's death five weeks ago.

37
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,060
Yes! It's party time!

38
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,939
So they didn't get on then?

39
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,139
He'd lived his entire life
in his father's shadow.

40
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,299
He was heard telling
an aide at the funeral

41
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,939
that he'd spent his adult
life waiting for him to die.

42
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,220
Oh, what a charmer.

43
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:03,359
How much did he get?

44
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,499
North of 850 million.

45
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,539
He got the family money
and his father's shares,

46
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,020
but he has no real power.

47
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,979
His father was respected,
but he isn't.

48
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,499
The board of Gulf Partnership
quickly closed ranks

49
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,900
to stop him taking control.

50
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,558
Which left Wasem with a bit
of a chip on his shoulder.

51
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,859
Oh, poor love

52
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,339
They see him for what
he is... Little more than a thug.

53
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,019
He doesn't earn respect,
he buys it.

54
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,539
Using his wealth to surround
himself with people

55
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,020
who will do whatever he asks.

56
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:37,800
Including an enforcer, someone who
will kill or torture on demand.

57
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,299
The man who led the move
to stop Wasem taking control

58
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,579
of his father's company was
found with his throat cut

59
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,859
in his own bathroom by his 10-year-old
daughter, yesterday afternoon.

60
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,779
Wasem has been linked
to two similar killings

61
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,819
since his father's death, and
a long list of business associates

62
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,578
being beaten and having
their families threatened.

63
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,479
- Question.
- Go on.

64
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,939
We usually spend our time staying
away from people like this.

65
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,859
Why are we going after him?

66
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,480
I think he's too good to pass up.

67
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,099
He's been making his way around
Europe playing the markets.

68
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,699
For anyone that openly opposes
him, he uses violence,

69
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,859
but he knows that to take control
of his father's company, he has

70
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,859
to prove to the shareholders he has
his father's flair for making money.

71
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,019
So far he's played the markets
in Greece, Turkey, Spain,

72
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,499
and Portugal, making a
hefty profit in each.

73
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,699
Now he's in London, and he'll
be looking for a broker.

74
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,899
Why travel?
You can buy shares anywhere.

75
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,939
That's one of the lessons he
actually learnt from his father...

76
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,459
local knowledge is the key
to making a good return.

77
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,419
So he flies in, talks
to whoever he can,

78
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,859
tries to find an inside track, and
then buys through a local broker.

79
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,320
What kind of money
are we talking about?

80
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:58,739
In Spain he invested
six million euros.

81
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,099
He is very definitely high risk,
but with that comes high rewards.

82
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,459
Well...I'm in.

83
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,179
Ash?

84
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,859
Well, you know me.
Where you go, I go.

85
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,219
Albert?

86
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,340
Yeah, all right.

87
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,980
It would be rude not to.

88
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,900
Good.
Then let's go get him.

89
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,139
It is done.

90
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,660
How?

91
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,619
His throat cut from ear
to ear while he sat...

92
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,820
in the restroom.

93
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,420
Very appropriate.

94
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,279
You know the last
thing he said to me

95
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,839
was that my only chance

96
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,739
of regaining my father's company...

97
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,059
had gone down the toilet.

98
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,979
There was a problem.

99
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,899
His wife ran to a neighbour,
the police shut off the streets,

100
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,259
- our enforcer was trapped.
- Was he arrested?

101
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,819
No.
They shot him.

102
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,420
He is dead.

103
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Replace him.

104
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,420
So what's going on?

105
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,659
Truth?

106
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,379
Always.

107
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,419
I'm tired, Albert.

108
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,100
Take a break.

109
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,979
I don't think a fortnight in Vegas
is gonna cure it this time.

110
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,779
Well, so take a year...two.

111
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,979
It's not that easy.
What about you?

112
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,299
Ash?
Sean and Emma?

113
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,539
We're all big enough
to take care of ourselves.

114
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,419
No, we're a crew, a family.

115
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,519
We don't walk out on each other.

116
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,780
So this guy isn't just another mark?
He's your retirement fund?

117
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,499
Marks like this one don't
come along very often.

118
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,619
No they don't.

119
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,019
So maybe everything we've done
has been leading us to this point.

120
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,140
One big mark, our
very own lottery win.

121
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,459
Then we can all walk away on
top, money in our pockets.

122
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,220
He could kill you.

123
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,300
Well, then we make that
a risk worth taking.

124
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,139
Oh, Emma, shopping list.

125
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,380
Oo, my kind of job.

126
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:27,079
Anything new there Em?

127
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,179
Yeah. His favourite buys are gas
and oil, but he hates new media,

128
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,459
pharmaceuticals,
retail companies.

129
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,238
What he loves best
is an edge, something

130
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,339
that sets him ahead
from everybody else.

131
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,499
Then that's exactly
what we'll give him.

132
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:41,399
Sean, let's see how long we've
got, he's got a private plane,

133
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,819
but check with the service see
when he's due to leave.

134
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,180
- Yeah, gotcha.
- How are things going?

135
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:47,659
It's going live now,
bank account's set up,

136
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,339
- I'm still working on the hardware
but I think I can crack it. - Great.

137
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,220
We're in.

138
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,940
Yeah. No, no, no.
Sure...

139
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,699
No, listen, we wait. We wait until
New York opens in the morning,

140
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,699
because if the Dow Jones rallies
we'll get more action here.

141
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,020
Yeah. My clients have very specific
targets with zero risk attached.

142
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,579
Yes, I said zero.

143
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,059
No, but listen, we wait...we wait
until the very last moment,

144
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,579
and then we buy fast before anyone
else gets wind of what we're buying.

145
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,019
No-one else in London
will get close.

146
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,060
All right, call you later.
Bye.

147
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,458
- It's too much.
- Would you relax!

148
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,859
This is still peanuts. We could
move up to ten million

149
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,399
before anyone else
starts asking questions.

150
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,139
Well, I'm not so sure.
I think it's all happening too fast.

151
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,438
What if they realise why
we buy what we do?

152
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:45,939
They won't.
How could they?

153
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,580
Relax. Breathe! Have some wine,
try the T-bone, it's to die for.

154
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,059
- Gentlemen, forgive me.
- Yes?

155
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,739
My employer, Madani Wasem,
was on the next table

156
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,859
and couldn't help overhear you
talking about your business.

157
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,940
You trade on the London
stock markets, no?

158
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,779
I'm sorry... Why are we having
this conversation?

159
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,459
Mr Wasem is in London
for a short time,

160
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,019
and he would like to invite you
to visit him at his hotel.

161
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,540
He believes you may find such
a visit to be mutually beneficial.

162
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,539
He said what!?

163
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,339
That he did not do home visits

164
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,420
and should you wish to talk to him
then to do so during office hours.

165
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,199
Did you tell this "William Cole"
who I was?

166
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,579
- Yes, sir.
- And?

167
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,420
He said that he had
heard of your father.

168
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,339
There's a fine line between
piquing someone's interest

169
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,019
- and being so rude they never want
to set eyes on you again. - True.

170
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,979
- But do you think he'll call?
- He's a bully.

171
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,899
It upsets him when people don't do
what he wants them to do.

172
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,539
Evening, all.

173
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,899
- What's that?
- What's what?

174
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,659
- The cable.
- What cable?

175
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,339
Oh this! Oh! Well, it depends
on how you look at it.

176
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,059
To the untrained eye, this is just a
length of fibre-optic cable.

177
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,259
But in the right hands and
with a bit of razzle dazzle,

178
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,660
this is the beating heart
of the British economy.

179
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,420
He called yet?

180
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,540
Playing hard to get never
worked for me either.

181
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,540
We've found a London broker who
can oversee all our purchases.

182
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,420
OK, I think we might
need a boost.

183
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,379
Bloody marvellous, the
man's a miracle worker.

184
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,019
Invested 40k, got a 60%
return inside of three days.

185
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,819
- That's incredible. - Someone
must be giving him an edge.

186
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,059
- What's his name again?
- Cole. William Cole.

187
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,099
- Don't they call him "Golden Balls"
or such like? - That's the chappie.

188
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,359
Can you get me in to see him?

189
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,059
Well, I'll try, old son,
but he's quite exclusive.

190
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,540
Mind you, not hard to see why.

191
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,619
You won't make it ring
by looking at it.

192
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,140
Maybe I called it wrong.

193
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,180
No, you're just wound up.

194
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,900
I mean, most of the time,
when a mark's just a mark,

195
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:18,659
you get a set-back, you don't panic,
you take it in your stride.

196
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,580
It's only cos this one's
more important.

197
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,220
Sorry, I don't get you.

198
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,939
How long have I known you, Mick?

199
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,699
- 20 years? - And in all that time,
you've played the odds.

200
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,260
Avoided marks like this Wasem
bloke like the plague.

201
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,779
So I figure if that's
no longer the case,

202
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,979
then either you've got a
death wish, in which case

203
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,079
I'm not sure why you have
to take me with you.

204
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,660
Or...he's a special kind of mark.

205
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,460
The kind of mark who'll give you enough
money to get out of the game forever.

206
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,859
Am I that easy to read?

207
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,499
Yeah, a doddle, always have been.

208
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,779
I should have known.
You can't kid a kidder.

209
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,979
No, that's bollocks.

210
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,860
You can kid anyone...
Except a mate.

211
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,019
Whatever you do is all right
with me. Do you mean that?

212
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,339
I wouldn't have said it otherwise.

213
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,739
Just don't start getting all
soppy on me, all right?

214
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,139
Anyway, I'm not getting any younger
and I'm fed up of carrying you.

215
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,740
Well, yes. Yeah.

216
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,700
Although none of this makes a blind
bit of difference if he doesn't call.

217
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,500
Time for plan B?

218
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,059
William Cole.

219
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,299
Mr Cole, this is Madani Wasem.

220
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,100
Let me check my diary.

221
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,300
No, sorry, I can't do noon.

222
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,700
Yeah, yeah, I can do 12.30.

223
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,300
OK, yeah, see you then.

224
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,459
Yeah, it's me.
We're in.

225
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,820
Thank you, Emma.

226
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,100
I swear that girl could scam a space
shuttle if she set her mind to it.

227
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,739
You know, long before "con"
became a dirty word,

228
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,859
all it stood for was "confidence".

229
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,099
And what's so bad about that?

230
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,739
Now, I'm not saying that all my
peers are angels, far from it!

231
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,019
But whatever industry you work in,
be it an office, or a hospital,

232
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,139
or a road gang I guarantee you'll
have your share of rogues too.

233
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,699
We're criminals because
we work outside the law.

234
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,500
Fine. But what we do, we
can't do without greed.

235
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,539
Take Madani Wasem for instance.
Now, he could buy his stocks

236
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,439
and his shares just
like everyone else.

237
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,539
Pay the same price,

238
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,739
take the same risk. If he did,
there's no way we could touch him.

239
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,258
Honestly, do you think
we could do what we do

240
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,459
if he wasn't looking for an edge?

241
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,478
If he wasn't looking
for something that gave

242
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,779
him an unfair advantage
over everyone else?

243
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,539
No. It's his greed that
makes him fair game.

244
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,140
All we do, is feed that greed.

245
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,620
And the greedier he is,
the more we can take him for.

246
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,419
All we need to do now is plan
things and cover all the angles

247
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,100
so there are no surprises.

248
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,418
- So how we doing?
- Yeah, good to go. Sean's out front,

249
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:32,819
he'll give us a heads
up when they're here.

250
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,579
- We doing a convincer?
- I thought I'd freeze him out.

251
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,599
Do you think that's a good idea?

252
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:39,199
The more we drive him mad,
the more he'll want to break us.

253
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,539
I get the logic, but this is a mark
who has people killed, mate

254
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,340
and your strategy
is pissing him off.

255
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:46,139
I know what I'm doing.

256
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,060
Yeah?

257
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,779
He's here.
And he's got some bird with him.

258
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,940
What bird?

259
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,860
"Fit" doesn't help, Sean.
Any clue what she does?

260
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,939
No, no, it's OK, send 'em up.

261
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,179
If you'd just like to take the
elevator up to the sixth floor,

262
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,760
somebody will meet you there.
Thank you.

263
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,020
Mr Wasem?
Perfect, right this way, please.

264
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,019
Don't worry.
Don't worry, ok?

265
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,179
Take this one. When you get
back, all right, just call me,

266
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,820
- we'll talk about it. Ok?
- Ok. Ok. - Good, good.

267
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,779
Mr Wasem.
Very pleased to meet you.

268
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,380
This is my broker whilst I'm
in London, Yvonne Hammond.

269
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,260
Ms Hammond.
A pleasure.

270
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,299
So. Well, look, we can, er...
Oh, Henry, for God's sake, leave it.

271
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,299
- Get out! - I'm sorry
- Get out! Out! Come on!

272
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,339
How quickly can
you leave an office?

273
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,299
Terribly sorry about that,
must be hire a cretin week.

274
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,860
You stay.

275
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,299
- I've been hearing a lot of good
things about you, Mr Cole. - Oh?

276
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,539
People are very impressed with
the returns you've achieved

277
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,259
and in such a short space of time.

278
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,739
Well, that's the beauty
of the markets isn't it?

279
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,099
I mean, if you're well informed
and you're, you're quick enough,

280
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,460
all things are possible.

281
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,220
They talk to you like you're
the lowest form of life.

282
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,580
Want to know where you are
every minute of the day,

283
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:50,259
run here, go there, do this, move that,
then they treat you like a muppet.

284
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,979
I know everything he does.
I know how he makes his money

285
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,299
and why everyone thinks
he's golden bollocks.

286
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,619
What do I get for it?
Nothing. Just abuse.

287
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,839
I don't suppose your bloke's
got any jobs going, has he?

288
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,139
I do IT.
Information exchange systems.

289
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,499
- I don't think so. - Yeah, well, if you
hear of anything, let us know, eh?

290
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,140
I'd love to be able to tell him
where to stick his job.

291
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,379
Mr Wasem is in London for three
days and whilst he's here,

292
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,100
he's very keen to make
some investments.

293
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,299
And?

294
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,219
He would be very interested to hear
if you have any advice to give him.

295
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,459
After discussing your fee, of course.

296
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,899
- We do some business, yes?
- Ah.

297
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,139
Ah?

298
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,940
Mmm, awkward.
I have a waiting list.

299
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,219
- You have a waiting list?
- Yes.

300
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,019
Do you know who I am?

301
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,659
Yes, yes, but even so.

302
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,219
We understand that you must
have a very long list of people

303
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,179
eager to do business
with you, Mr Cole,

304
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,619
but we're equally sure

305
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,900
that you could find a way to
make an exception for Mr Wasem.

306
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,059
He asked me to wait in line!

307
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,020
- I could go back in there and
speak to him. - No, screw him.

308
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,700
You.
Screw you.

309
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,339
I will crush you.

310
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,740
Get the car.

311
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,580
I don't think he's very happy.

312
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,220
I do not know what you said
to him but he was not pleased.

313
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,598
What have I missed?

314
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,099
- Does anyone know she
was in London? - No.

315
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,699
I mean, we didn't know she was in
the game but did she know we were?

316
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,259
She can't have known.

317
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,219
Sorry, I've missed something here,

318
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,660
- like a meeting or something.
- We need to talk to her.

319
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:54,540
- Do we know where to find her?
- No. But she knows where to find us.

320
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,179
Eh! You'll never guess what.

321
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,499
Stacie's here.

322
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,259
- How does he, how does he do that?
- Mickey! Your face was a picture.

323
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,539
Never thought I'd see
you speechless.

324
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,539
- Well, it was a bit of a shock.
- I'm sorry.

325
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,899
- Ash.
- Hello darlin'. Long time.

326
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,699
- Albie. - You look magnificent
and you feel even better.

327
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,939
- Stacie, this is Emma
and Sean Kennedy. - Hi. - Hello.

328
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,179
- You all right?
- Ash has told me all about you.

329
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,459
He called occasionally.

330
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,299
Yeah, well, I'm not
good with small talk.

331
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,299
- Yes, so I noticed.
- Where's Danny?

332
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,899
Oh, he fell in love with a
cocktail waitress in Santa Monica.

333
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,738
They were planning a summer wedding,
choosing names for their children.

334
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,339
Then her husband found out.

335
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,659
Last I heard, they were
heading for Vegas.

336
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,899
- Apparently, Danny had a plan.
- Yeah, I bet he did.

337
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,419
How long you been back? Why
didn't you tell us you were coming

338
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,560
and how long you staying?

339
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,819
A girl can't answer that many
questions without a drink.

340
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,619
I'll kill him.

341
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,480
I'll wipe every trace
of him off the Earth.

342
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,979
Now, you.

343
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,760
You, go and shoot him.

344
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,700
It's the UK, sir,
we can't carry guns.

345
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,619
- Where's my enforcer?
- I have found someone.

346
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,619
A Ukrainian, Alex Klukas, he was
recommended to me by one of our men.

347
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,700
He has the details.
But there may also be another way.

348
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,420
- So what you playing?
- Nothing fancy.

349
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:38,359
Just thought I'd siphon
off the top of whatever

350
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,659
he invested, get 10 or 20
grand and disappear.

351
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,219
- That's when you ran into us.
- Exactly.

352
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,099
Have you any idea how
angry you made him?

353
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,939
Yeah, I think so.

354
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,299
I don't know how far
along you are, Mickey,

355
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,700
but I'd think seriously about
walking away from this one.

356
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,019
Why?

357
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,419
There's just something about him.
He's not a very nice man.

358
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,299
Everyone's frightened of him.

359
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,019
- I've never met a nice mark yet.
- No, it's more than that.

360
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,339
We know he uses a hit man, he knocked
some bloke off two days ago.

361
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,659
Exactly.

362
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,499
We know what he's capable of.
It's a calculated risk.

363
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,340
- So are you going back?
- I don't know.

364
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,259
It ain't going to hurt,
having you on the inside, Stace.

365
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,539
That's true.

366
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,359
As far as I can see all you've
done so far is wind him up

367
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,698
- and make him furious.
- Look, he's a bully.

368
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:28,599
So we take away his control,
you know, take away his power,

369
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,339
- make him feel small. - And, then,
when he's ready to burst...

370
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,339
- We find a way to give him
that control back. - How?

371
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,740
Just like that.
Ah-ho-ho-ho.

372
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,180
Hello?

373
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,338
We don't have to do this, you know,
we could bring him in another way.

374
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:59,139
- Yes, Mum.
- I mean it. - I'll be OK.

375
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,899
Tell him what he wants to know
quickly, don't string it out.

376
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,698
This is our convincer, if he
doesn't have to work for it,

377
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:05,499
he won't believe it.

378
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,478
I know but you can make sure...

379
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,779
Will you just stop? I've been to
the toilet, I've washed me hands

380
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,099
- and I've got a clean hankie,
all right? - All right.

381
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,380
Don't wait up.

382
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,739
Hello, how are you?

383
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,300
Good, thanks.

384
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,699
- Barir said something about a job?
- Yeah, of course.

385
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,179
Think of this as a job interview.

386
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,459
Right.
OK.

387
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,139
Now Barir tells me that you know
how Mr Cole selects his investments.

388
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,939
Er, yeah, well, kind of. But I'm
not sure I should talk about that.

389
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,459
Oh?

390
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,819
Well, it's not part of
my job, not really,

391
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,900
I do IT, you see.
I've, um, brought my CV.

392
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,100
There you go.

393
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,260
Let me ask you the question
in a different way.

394
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,219
You know how he selects
his investments.

395
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,539
I know what he does,

396
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,620
I heard him talking to the
yank but I don't know how.

397
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,979
Look, I swear, I don't know.

398
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,779
I know what his edge is, I know
why he never loses any money,

399
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,579
but how the whole thing works,
the mechanics, only he knows that.

400
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,139
You will tell me everything
you know about William Cole

401
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,300
and how he selects his investments.

402
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,140
Everything.

403
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,220
Every detail.
You leave nothing out.

404
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,500
Do you understand?

405
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,939
Oh, Jesus!

406
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,140
I think he's convinced.

407
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,859
I'm not going to meet you.

408
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,379
Sorry, sir, you don't
have an appointment!

409
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,540
I don't need one.

410
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,659
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sit down and shut up.

411
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,039
- I'm so sorry! He won't listen to me.
- Call security.

412
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,939
Call whoever you want,
you piece of shit.

413
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,939
Because the second after you throw
me out, I'm going to tell the police

414
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,939
about how you're intercepting data
from the London Stock Exchange.

415
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,979
Which would put you out of business
and into prison.

416
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,499
Sir?

417
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,379
Erm, yeah, it's, er, it's OK,
Alice, take the rest of the day off.

418
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,139
Close the door behind you.

419
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,579
Now he wants a meeting.
Now he wants to talk.

420
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,859
Well, maybe I don't want
to do business.

421
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,659
Maybe I got a waiting list.

422
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,399
Look, I didn't mean to offend you.

423
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:59,999
No? Well, I'm about to
offend you. Talk to him.

424
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,819
Mr Wasem is a very reasonable
man and he has no wish

425
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,419
for things to be anything
other than cordial.

426
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,539
It's very lucky for you I'm a
reasonable man, you horse's ass.

427
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,339
But he insists that you show him
how the data is intercepted

428
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,299
and how you use this data to
choose which investments you make.

429
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,899
Before I do anything at all,

430
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,699
I want to know how you
came by this information.

431
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,339
That is none of your business.

432
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,100
You just show me how it works.

433
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,380
I can't do that because there
are other people involved.

434
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,299
Let me explain something
to you, Mr Golden Balls.

435
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,659
It would give me great pleasure
to just tell the police

436
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,619
everything I know and I can go home.

437
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,139
Or I can forget about the police

438
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:00,139
and just shoot you and
everyone you love in the head.

439
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,339
The only thing that's
stopping me from doing that

440
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,059
is the thought that I can
make some money here.

441
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,140
So you, you got
a very simple choice.

442
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,699
You can either show me
how the interception works

443
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,820
or you can go to prison

444
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,980
or you be dead.

445
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,099
All right, I'll need some time.

446
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,700
Of course.

447
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,420
You have a minute.

448
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,179
- Have you gone insane?
- I had no choice, they know.

449
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,059
How? That doesn't matter.

450
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,339
All that's important is that
you show me what I came to see.

451
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,540
I'm sorry, there's no other way.

452
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,059
This is it?

453
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,859
This cable carries a live feed into the
stock exchange building next door.

454
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,539
There was a fault in the system
and George was sent over

455
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,299
from the company in Houston
who supplied the software.

456
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,739
His team had to dig up the cable

457
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,019
so that they could fit a new
digital transcoder unit.

458
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,379
When we did, I realised with an
exposed cable and the right software,

459
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,899
we could manipulate the data
that passes through it.

460
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,019
This is a hard drive.

461
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,820
It records all of the data coming in

462
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:42,219
and holds it up for
nine tenths of a second

463
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,659
before playing it on down the line.

464
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,059
- To the stock exchange?
- Exactly.

465
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,299
It holds it up long enough
for us to analyse it

466
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,979
and identify any major shifts,
trends or movements,

467
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,340
before playing it on to the
stock exchange boards.

468
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:57,579
It's also hooked up to
our trading account,

469
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,099
so it can make purchases
based on those calculations.

470
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,499
Wait. You're saying you
can analyse the data

471
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,778
and actually purchase stocks
before the stock exchange

472
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:06,979
gets the same information?

473
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,819
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- But that's, that's genius.

474
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,979
- Can this be done? - Well, if,
if what they're saying is true.

475
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,179
- It's absolutely true.
- And there's no risk. Ever.

476
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,019
We only ever buy stock
we know is going to rise.

477
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,699
And presumably you can off-load before
anyone else if it starts to go down?

478
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,380
We don't hold on to it that long, we
just make our profits and get out.

479
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,099
OK, I'm in.

480
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,698
- You're in?
- In for what?

481
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:38,699
You will make investments for me.

482
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,019
Look, I'm sorry,
it's not that simple.

483
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,539
I heard you in the restaurant.

484
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,339
You said you have a
capacity for ten million.

485
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,099
Well, yes, I mean, that's the top
end of our buying power but...

486
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,138
But what?

487
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:52,939
Well, even if we had
that kind of money,

488
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,579
which, by the way, we don't,
we'd never go over a million,

489
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,219
we don't want to draw
attention to ourselves.

490
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,219
That's because you're a horse's ass.

491
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,459
You will invest the full ten million.

492
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,419
- Ten million?
- Hedge fund managers invest hundreds

493
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,979
of millions in a day, why
would anyone notice ten?

494
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,059
Because we're private brokers
trading for private investors.

495
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,019
Then you buy the stock in my name,

496
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,579
no-one will question that level
of investment if it's from me.

497
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,739
You take my ten million,
you double it.

498
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,100
Look, well I'd need all
the money in the account.

499
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:29,579
- And the returns?
- They'd go to the same account.

500
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,019
Miss Hammond will put
everything in place.

501
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,899
Look, I don't know, we'd have to
programme in a new trading account,

502
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,859
- and re-set the buying criteria.
- Then do it.

503
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,979
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
what do we get out of this, huh?

504
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,939
Yeah, I mean we still
get our commission, right?

505
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,819
Er, 22%. Cash.

506
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,019
Five per cent.

507
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,699
What?

508
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,260
Perhaps the experience will
teach you some manners.

509
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,460
You call me when it's ready.

510
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,179
OK, once the money is
in the trading account,

511
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,979
- I want two men watching
Cole around the clock. - Yes, sir.

512
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,539
I want you to learn how
they programme the machine.

513
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,460
Me? Why?

514
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,939
Because once you can use it,
I'll have no further use for Cole

515
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,339
and the old man.

516
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,380
Wait.

517
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,619
I don't mind bending the
rules to make money,

518
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,419
the City's corrupt anyway.

519
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,100
But I won't be a party to murder.

520
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,940
Would you rather
I asked someone else?

521
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,220
Cos then, I wouldn't need you either.

522
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,819
No.

523
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,660
Then just do it.

524
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,420
Call my enforcer,
get him on a plane.

525
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,099
OK, time to bail out.

526
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,539
You what?

527
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,379
He wants me to learn how
to programme the machine.

528
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,059
So that he can have you killed.

529
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,299
Well, that's kind of
what we expected.

530
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,499
He told Barir to call the
enforcer and whatever you do,

531
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,339
- he's not going to let you
out of his sight. - I know.

532
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,299
From tomorrow morning he'll have
two of his guards on you full time.

533
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,499
Even if you pull this off,
you'll never get away clean.

534
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,419
This is wicked.

535
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,419
Without a doubt, this is one of the
coolest things I've ever tried on.

536
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,259
I actually look like I could
swim faster than a shark!

537
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,540
- All right, Stace?
- Hi.

538
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,939
Just for the record,

539
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,859
this isn't an accurate
representation of my underwear.

540
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,180
Pleased to hear it.

541
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,638
He's got issues, from
when he was a baby.

542
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,739
I do not have issues.

543
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,339
Mickey, I don't like it.

544
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,859
- It feels wrong.
- What about the money?

545
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,579
He's having it transferred first thing
tomorrow before the markets open.

546
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,419
He's also bringing 500,000
in cash which is your commission

547
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,619
- if you double him up.
- OK.

548
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,340
I tell you someone's planning to have
you killed and all you say is OK?

549
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,939
You're taking ten million
from this man, Mickey,

550
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,260
he's not going to just put it down
to experience and walk away.

551
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,299
I know Wasem won't just walk away.

552
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,900
Which is why it's a good reason
for us all to lay low for a bit.

553
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,699
So, I was thinking,
when this job is done,

554
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,059
we should take a break.
Go our separate ways for a while.

555
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,299
- How long's a while?
- Who knows?

556
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,459
I thought it best
not to make plans.

557
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,419
I was going to talk to you about
this when the job was done but...

558
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,459
seems now is as good a time as any.

559
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,699
So, that's why we're taking this
job? It's walking away money?

560
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,219
If you want to call it that.

561
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,299
That's it, then? One last job
and we're finished, huh?

562
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,259
I've always thought it was a good
idea to quit while you're ahead.

563
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,780
I think ten million
qualifies as being ahead.

564
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,099
This is the question.

565
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,660
If you didn't take this break,
would you still do the job?

566
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,700
If I'm honest.

567
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,379
No, I wouldn't.

568
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,939
And I wouldn't blame any one of you
that wanted to walk away right now.

569
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,699
But, come on!
The money comes in tomorrow.

570
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,059
Our play is that the
City of London police

571
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,779
has had us under surveillance.

572
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,459
Ash has lined up a dozen
grifters and all the vehicles.

573
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,019
We get ourselves arrested
but we let Wasem get away.

574
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,638
He'll go straight to the airport,
desperate to leave the country,

575
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,239
thinking the money's been impounded,

576
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,019
there's nothing to keep him here,
where as we, on the other hand,

577
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,620
will cash in and be long gone
by the time the dust settles.

578
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,260
It will work.
Trust me.

579
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,499
Hello.

580
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,059
We have a job.

581
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,060
Stay in your room,
I will send over a package.

582
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,900
- You OK?
- Yeah.

583
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,299
So, it must be nice
to see Stacie again.

584
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,739
- Yeah, yeah, it is.
- Yeah, Ash told me that you two, um,

585
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,139
- you were quite close for a while.
- Yeah, we were.

586
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,380
- Yeah, you go back a long way.
- Yeah, that's right.

587
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,739
So, this, er, whole break thing.
You know the whole, um,

588
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,419
going our own way thing.

589
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,939
Only it's a bit sudden
and it's a bit like,

590
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,499
Stacie turning up the way she has
and I just, I...I was wondering

591
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,859
if the two things were
related in any way.

592
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,139
It's just curiosity, really,
It's a good job I'm not a cat.

593
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,819
- No, the thing, the thing is...
- No, it's not. - It's not what?

594
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,179
- Related.
- OK.

595
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,219
It's just... I want to live
a normal life for a while.

596
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,219
Get to know people
for who they are.

597
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,059
Not constantly look at them and see
if they'd make a great mark or not.

598
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,779
So, it's more like a holiday, really?

599
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,699
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, so we could
still, you know, like, meet up

600
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,379
and spend time together
and...and chill.

601
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,139
I'd like that.

602
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,699
Me too. Then the work thing wouldn't
be there any more, would it?

603
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,899
No, it wouldn't.

604
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,459
And if everything goes right
tomorrow, then you know,

605
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,019
we'll be stinking rich.

606
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,179
Yes, we will.

607
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,579
So, at some point,
we could be talking

608
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,499
you and me, and a desert island and,

609
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,940
like, a couple of million
in the bank or something.

610
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,859
That doesn't sound
too shabby, does it?

611
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,660
No, it doesn't.

612
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,460
OK, good.

613
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,019
Great, well, then I'll just
leave you to your thinking.

614
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,300
I just thought I'd ask.

615
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:43,260
I'm really glad you did.

616
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,419
OK, so you go when Albert calls
Nick to give him the thumbs up.

617
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,438
Hard and fast, OK?
Lots of noise.

618
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:24,139
We need them scared enough
to run straight to the airport.

619
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,419
Everyone in cuffs and
dragged out to the vans.

620
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,779
So, we're going to be outside
the London Stock Exchange,

621
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,179
in broad daylight, so it won't be
long before the real old bill notice.

622
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,179
So, don't hang about, get them
in the vans and on your way.

623
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,779
The mark is last up.

624
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,499
He'll be with his
bodyguard and Stacie.

625
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,299
Stacie will offer to
bribe Nick at that point

626
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,619
- and that's when you let them go.
Is that all clear? - Yeah.

627
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,619
Right, get yourselves in position.

628
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,779
Good luck.

629
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,540
All right?

630
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
Nice one.
Take care, Albert.

631
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,379
So, Stacie called.
The money's in the trading account

632
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,919
but when we get there, Wasem
needs to put his pin number in,

633
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,019
- before we can move it.
- OK.

634
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,499
We'll clear out of the penthouse and
meet at the hotel when it's done.

635
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,700
We'll split the money by
direct transfer, and then...

636
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,420
all go our separate ways.

637
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,139
Everyone know what they're doing?
Right.

638
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,139
What about me?

639
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,939
Eh?

640
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,779
Everyone's talking about
the biggest job ever,

641
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,979
you know, history in
the making and all that

642
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,739
and everyone's got
something to do except me.

643
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,979
Even the bloody dogs
have got a part.

644
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,419
Yeah, yeah, well, er, there's a reason
we haven't given you anything yet, Ed.

645
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,859
- Yeah? - Because we've
saved the best till last.

646
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,859
Ah, see, I thought it'd be
something like that.

647
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,819
So, what? Do I get like
a uniform, an' all that?

648
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,419
No, you won't need one,

649
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,260
you see, the most important
part of your job...

650
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,740
is to have the drinks ready and on
the table for when we get back.

651
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,220
Good luck, Ed.

652
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,540
Sir, we need your pin.

653
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,700
Thank you.

654
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,340
OK.
Three minutes.

655
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,020
- That it?
- Yeah. Like we were never here.

656
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,379
What's happening with my money?

657
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,500
It's all right.

658
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,780
It's buying.

659
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,419
Are we ready to do the transfer?

660
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,500
So, now, we transferring
his ten million

661
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:15,339
from the trading account,
into our account.

662
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,619
- Hi.
- Hello.

663
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,100
- We have a reservation,
under the name of Jones. - OK.

664
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:58,139
This is the most fun I've ever had.
You know what?

665
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,139
I think we come back tomorrow,
we do it all over again.

666
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,619
Stay where you are!
Get on the floor! Down now!

667
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,860
Armed Police! Nobody move! You are
under arrest on suspicion of fraud.

668
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,659
Come on.
Come on.

669
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,179
- This has nothing to do with us.
- All right, darlin', tell it to the judge.

670
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,198
No, no, no, I mean it.
They did it,

671
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:27,099
they have this machine,
they wanted us to invest.

672
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,659
That's what happened,
she's telling the truth!

673
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,859
- We didn't even give them the money.
- Hold up.

674
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,100
Bring 'em back.

675
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,420
Take the rest of them away.

676
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,139
It was...it was just
a demonstration,

677
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,299
we only met them yesterday.

678
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,859
They were trying to convince
us to invest but we didn't.

679
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,540
Open the bag, you can
see for yourself.

680
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,540
- So, this is your money?
- Yes.

681
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,219
B-But it doesn't have to be.
It could be yours.

682
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,820
So, if it just disappeared.

683
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,100
There is half a million pounds
in cash in that bag, so...

684
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,539
If you let us go we won't
even look back, I swear.

685
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:27,019
I've got a jet fuelled
and ready to leave,

686
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,939
I can be out of the
country in an hour.

687
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,619
You've got the machine,
the people who built it.

688
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,820
Why do you need us?

689
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,540
Our friend's on his
way to the airport.

690
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:54,259
Stacie's going to lose him and
meet you back at the hotel.

691
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,299
You son of a bitch, you did it.

692
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,340
Hold tight.

693
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,299
You did well.

694
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,340
Just get on the plane before
they change their mind.

695
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,419
We're back.

696
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,780
Ah. Hey.
Ha-ha-ha.

697
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,219
Current balance, ten million pounds.

698
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,899
Yes! And he gave us half a
mill commission in cash

699
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,820
- for taking it off him.
- Yeah-hey.

700
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,059
Thank you, my dear.

701
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:02,459
- To us. To us!
- Yeah, yeah! Woo hoo!

702
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,340
They've just gone into the hotel.
No. No police.

703
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,580
- Ah, taste of victory.
- Scary. Scary.

704
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,940
Guys, get out.

705
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,340
Go. Go, go, move.

706
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,340
Come on, Albert.

707
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,700
Mickey Bricks,

708
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,140
if you've ever been brilliant,
please be brilliant now.

709
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:46,499
Gentlemen. I know what
you're thinking but, er...

710
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,460
That's my money. That's my money.
Come on, come on.

711
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,619
I guess most of you
must have thought that,

712
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,660
one day, it would end like this.

713
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,939
Which, without an extraordinary
amount of planning,

714
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,220
it very well might have done.

715
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,779
Come on, then. Off your arses.
Wakey wakey.

716
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,099
Honestly, eh?

717
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,558
What would you lot
do without me coming

718
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,059
to bale you out of
trouble all the time?

719
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,219
I mean it's all right Mickey
doing all that,

720
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:40,539
"Look at me, I'm a clever bastard"
stuff, but when it comes down to it.

721
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,500
You just can't do it
without me, can you?

722
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:45,579
- Are you sure you couldn't find
anyone else? - I'm sorry.

723
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,619
- Hello. Who's this? Very pretty.
- Hello, sweetheart.

724
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,660
I'm Danny. Danny Blue.
Probably heard a lot about me.

725
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,620
Call my enforcer,
get him on a plane.

726
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,500
- Alex Klukas?
- I'm here.

727
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,780
Hello, Mickey.

728
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,379
Try this on.

729
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,939
Just for the record, this isn't
an accurate representation

730
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,100
of my underwear.

731
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,940
I want you to learn how
they programme the machine.

732
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,659
How does the machine work?

733
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,899
Well, basically, it's a box
with a bunch of lights in it.

734
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,499
I thought it might be.

735
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,460
Gentlemen.
I know what you're thinking.

736
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,020
Come on then, off your arses.

737
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:20,420
- Did you, er, did you throw it all
over? - Nah, fifty grand or so.

738
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,659
Er, now might be a good
time to slip away.

739
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,499
I think that's a fabulous idea.

740
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,358
How about, me and you, we
just slip away together?

741
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,059
Danny, behave.

742
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,420
Easy pal, that's my sister.

743
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:54,699
Whoa, everybody's a bit
touchy, ain't they?

744
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,979
I didn't have to use blanks,
you know, I did think about it.

745
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,619
- How you doing, Albie?
- Pretty good, Danny, pretty good.

746
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,619
- I'm sorry I had to shoot you.
- Don't worry about it.

747
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,399
I blame Mickey.
He's very theatrical.

748
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,499
- Someone shut him up.
- It was OTT, that's all I'm saying.

749
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,479
- We were still being watched.
- Exactly.

750
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,979
Always playing to the audience.

751
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,699
Listen, listen, mate, when you've
taken someone for ten million,

752
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,599
the only way you can
be sure they're not

753
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,299
coming after you is if
they think you're dead.

754
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,579
Ten million? Is this a good time
to talk about my cut?

755
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:25,740
I think we'd better be going.
Time we should make a move, come on.

756
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,939
Wahey. Yeah.

757
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,099
- I've just had an amazing and
original idea. - God, help us.

758
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,779
Bear with me, right, one, two,
three, there's seven of us, right?

759
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,779
We should hook up. We'll start
a new gang, maybe I'll lead it,

760
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,219
we'll call it....

761
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,780
The Magnificent Seven.

762
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:55,419
- What d'you think, Albert?
- I think that's a hell of an idea.

763
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:59,780
- What about The Great Eight?
- To The Great Eight.

764
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,899
So, that's it.
I'm out of here.

765
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,859
I hope you've picked up
a few things along the way.

766
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:11,059
If something seems too good to
be true, it almost certainly is.

767
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,259
Always look a gift horse in the mouth.

768
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,139
Unless you don't much care
whether it has teeth or not.

769
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,620
And, remember, you can't
cheat an honest man.

770
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,419
So, if you bend the rules
to make some easy money,

771
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,179
you deserve what you get.

772
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,859
Oh, and, er, don't believe
everything people tell you.

773
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,379
Whoever they are.

774
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,019
Think things through for yourself.

775
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,539
Is it for real?

776
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:39,420
Is someone telling you
that story for a reason?

777
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,780
Or...are they
having you right at it?

778
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,939
But most important of all...

779
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,379
Whether it's business...

780
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,019
- Buying.
- Selling.

781
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,419
- Whether it's someone you know.
- Or someone you don't.

782
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,420
Even if it's love.

783
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,260
Never be a mark.
