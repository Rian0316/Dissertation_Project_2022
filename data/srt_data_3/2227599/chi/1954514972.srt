1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,500
Come on, Albert!

2
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,700
Mickey Bricks,

3
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,000
if you've ever been brilliant,
please be brilliant now.

4
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,500
Gentlemen! I know what
you're thinking...

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
but, er...

6
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,600
I guess...

7
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,300
most of you must have thought that...

8
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,600
one day it would end like this...

9
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,900
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.net presents</font>

12
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,700
***

13
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,800
Oh, you did not just say that!

14
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,500
- It is a well known fact.
- Well known by who?

15
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,400
- Everyone.
- Not me.

16
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,500
That's because you're a bird.

17
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,800
Mickey?

18
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,900
Leave me out of this.

19
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
How can you say women are more
argumentative than men?

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,500
- Because it's a well-known fact.
- No it is not.

21
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,300
- See?
- See what?

22
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
mentioned that women are
more argumentative than men,

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,700
and you've done
nothing but argue since.

24
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
- I was discussing.
- What's the difference?

25
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,600
One is arguing and the other one....

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
isn't.

27
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,400
Way to go, sis.
You baffled him with logic...

28
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,700
He knows what I mean.
Eddie, do you think I'm argumentative?

29
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,200
- You are a bit, yeah.
- No, I'm not.

30
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,500
- I wasn't arguing.
- No, she was discussing, you see.

31
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,100
Yeah, they do a lot of that, birds.

32
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,300
- Yeah, they do...mmm.
- Mmm.

33
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,700
Oh, all right.

34
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,300
You can be so annoying,
really...all of you.

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,800
Well, looks like you were right,
he arrived last evening.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Who did?

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,700
Our new mark.

38
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,500
Madani Wasem.

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Came to London in the '80s
to re-trace his father's footsteps

40
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,100
and accept a place at Oxford University.

41
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,900
He graduated with a degree in economics

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,600
before returning to Bahrain to take his
place on the board of his father's company

43
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,100
The Gulf Partnership.

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Wasem was with friends when he heard
of his father's death five weeks ago.

45
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes! It's party time!

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,400
So they didn't get on then?

47
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,100
He'd lived his entire
life in his father's shadow.

48
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
He was heard telling
an aide at the funeral

49
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,100
that he'd spent his adult
life waiting for him to die.

50
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
Oh, what a charmer.

51
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
How much did he get?

52
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,000
North of 850 million.

53
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,900
He got the family money
and his father's shares,

54
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,500
but he has no real power.

55
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,500
His father was respected,
but he isn't.

56
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,500
The board of Gulf Partnership quickly
closed ranks to stop him taking control.

57
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Which left Wasem with a bit
of a chip on his shoulder.

58
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,300
Oh, poor love

59
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,900
They see him for what he is...
Little more than a thug.

60
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,500
He doesn't earn respect, he buys it.

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,300
Using his wealth to surround himself with
people who will do whatever he asks.

62
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
Including an enforcer,

63
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,300
someone who will kill
or torture on demand.

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,300
The man who led the move
to stop Wasem taking control

65
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,400
{\a6}***

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,700
of his father's company was
found with his throat cut

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,300
in his own bathroom by his
ten-year-old daughter, yesterday afternoon.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,200
Wasem has been linked to two similar
killings since his father's death,

69
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,000
{\a6}***

70
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,400
and a long list of business associates

71
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,800
being beaten and having
their families threatened.

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,700
- Question.
- Go on.

73
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,700
 We usually spend our time staying
away from people like this.

74
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,100
- Why are we going after him?
- I think he's too good to pass up.

75
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,700
He's been making his way around
Europe playing the markets.

76
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,300
For anyone that openly 
opposes him, he uses violence,

77
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,200
but he knows that to take
control of his father's company,

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,400
he has to prove to the shareholders
he has his father's flair for making money.

79
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,100
So far he's played the
markets in Greece,

80
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,900
Turkey, Spain, and Portugal,

81
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
making a hefty profit in each.

82
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,200
Now he's in London,
and he'll be looking for a broker.

83
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,500
Why travel? You can buy shares anywhere.

84
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,900
That's one of the lessons he
actually learnt from his father -

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
local knowledge is the key
to making a good return.

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
So he flies in,
talks to whoever he can,

87
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
tries to find an inside track,
and then buys through a local broker.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,900
What kind of money are we talking about?

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
In Spain he invested six million euros.

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,500
He is very definitely high risk,
but with that comes high rewards.

91
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,100
Well...I'm in.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Ash?

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,500
Well, you know me.
Where you go, I go.

94
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,100
Albert?

95
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,400
Yeah, all right.

96
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,600
It would be rude not to.

97
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,200
Good. Then let's go get him.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,200
It is done.

99
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,600
How?

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,300
His throat cut from
ear to ear while he sat...

101
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,200
in the restroom.

102
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,000
Very appropriate.

103
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,900
You know the last thing he said to me

104
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,300
was that my only chance of
regaining my father's company...

105
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,500
had gone down the toilet.

106
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,700
There was a problem.
His wife ran to a neighbour,

107
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,500
the police shut off the streets,
our enforcer was trapped.

108
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
- Was he arrested?
- No.

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
They shot him.

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
He is dead.

111
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,500
Replace him.

112
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
So what's going on?

113
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,600
Truth?

114
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,100
Always.

115
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
I'm tired, Albert.

116
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,700
Take a break.

117
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,700
I don't think a fortnight in Vegas
is gonna cure it this time.

118
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,500
Well, so take a year...two.

119
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,900
It's not that easy.

120
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,000
What about you?
Ash? Sean and Emma?

121
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,400
We're all big enough
to take care of ourselves.

122
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,000
No, we're a crew, a family.

123
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,000
We don't walk out on each other.

124
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,500
So this guy isn't just another mark?

125
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,500
He's your retirement fund?

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,900
Marks like this one
don't come along very often.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,100
No they don't.

128
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,500
So maybe everything we've done
has been leading us to this point.

129
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,900
One big mark,
our very own lottery win.

130
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,100
Then we can all walk away
on top, money in our pockets.

131
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,600
He could kill you.

132
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,100
Well, then we make that a risk worth taking.

133
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,500
Oh, Emma, shopping list.

134
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,100
Oo, my kind of job.

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
Anything new there Em?

136
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
Yeah. His favourite buys
are gas and oil,

137
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
but he hates new media,
pharmaceuticals, retail companies.

138
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,100
What he loves best is an edge,

139
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,000
something that sets him
ahead from everybody else.

140
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Then that's what we'll give him.

141
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
Sean, let's see how long we've
got, he's got a private plane,

142
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,800
but check to see when he's due to leave.

143
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Yeah, gotcha.

144
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,700
How are things going?

145
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,800
IT's going live now,
bank account's set up,

146
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,500
I'm still working on the hardware
but I think I can crack it.

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,800
Great.

148
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,500
We're in.

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,700
Yeah. 

150
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,100
No, no, no. Sure...

151
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,900
No, listen, we wait.

152
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,400
We wait until New
York opens in the morning,

153
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,000
because if the Dow Jones
rallies we'll get more action here.

154
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,700
Yeah.

155
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,700
My clients have very specific
targets with zero risk attached.

156
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,300
Yes, I said zero.

157
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
No, but listen, we wait...
we wait until the very last moment,

158
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
and then we buy fast before anyone
else gets wind of what we're buying.

159
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,000
No-one else in London will get close.

160
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,900
All right, call you later. Bye.

161
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
It's too much.

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,700
Would you relax! This is still peanuts.

163
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,600
We could move up to ten million before
anyone else starts asking questions.

164
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,200
Well, I'm not so sure.

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,600
I think it's all happening too fast.

166
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
What if they realise
why we buy what we do?

167
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,100
They won't. How could they?

168
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Relax. Breathe! Have some wine,
try the T-bone, it's to die for.

169
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
- Gentlemen, forgive me.
- Yes?

170
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
My employer, Madani Wasem,
was on the next table

171
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,400
and couldn't help overhear
you talking about your business.

172
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,000
You trade on the London stock markets, no?

173
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm sorry... Why are
we having this conversation?

174
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,800
Mr Wasem is in London
for a short time,

175
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,300
and he would like to invite
you to visit him at his hotel.

176
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,800
He believes you may find such
a visit to be mutually beneficial.

177
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,800
He said what!?

178
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,400
That he did not do home visits

179
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,600
and should you wish to talk to
him then to do so during office hours.

180
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,600
Did you tell this
"William Cole" Who I was?

181
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,700
Yes, sir.

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
And?

183
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
He said that he had
heard of your father.

184
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,000
There's a fine line between
piquing someone's interest

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,400
and being so rude they never
want to set eyes on you again.

186
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,900
True.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,200
But do you think he'll call?

188
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
He's a bully.

189
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,200
It upsets him when people don't
do what he wants them to do.

190
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,500
Evening, all.

191
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,000
- What's that?
- What's what?

192
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,600
- The cable.
- What cable?

193
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,500
Oh this! Oh!

194
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,100
Well, it depends on how you look at it.

195
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,700
To the untrained eye, this
is just a length of fibre-optic cable.

196
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,500
But in the right hands and
with a bit of razzle dazzle,

197
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,300
this is the beating heart
of the British economy.

198
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,400
He called yet?

199
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,600
Playing hard to get
never worked for me either.

200
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,200
We've found a London broker
who can oversee all our purchases.

201
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,200
OK, I think we might need a boost.

202
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,200
***

203
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,200
Bloody marvellous,
the man's a miracle worker.

204
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,600
Invested 40k, got a 60%
return inside of three days.

205
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,500
That's incredible.
Someone must be giving him an edge.

206
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
What's his name again?

207
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,000
Cole. William Cole.

208
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,500
Don't they call him
"Golden Balls" Or such like?

209
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
That's the chappie.

210
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,600
Can you get me in to see him?

211
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Well, I'll try, old son,
but he's quite exclusive.

212
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,300
Mind you, not hard to see why.

213
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,800
You won't make it
ring by looking at it.

214
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,600
Maybe I called it wrong.

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
No, you're just wound up.

216
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100
I mean, most of the time,
when a mark's just a mark,

217
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,200
you get a set-back, you don't
panic, you take it in your stride.

218
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,400
It's only cos this one's more important.

219
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,900
Sorry, I don't get you.

220
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,300
How long have I known you, Mick?

221
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,100
20 years?

222
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,200
And in all that time,
you've played the odds.

223
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,600
Avoided marks like this
Wasem bloke like the plague.

224
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,800
So I figure if that's no longer the case,
then either you've got a death wish,

225
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
in which case I'm not sure
why you have to take me with you.

226
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,100
Or...

227
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,600
he's a special kind of mark.

228
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,000
The kind of mark who'll give you enough
money to get out of the game forever.

229
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Am I that easy to read?

230
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,300
Yeah, a doddle, always have been.

231
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,200
I should have known.
You can't kid a kidder.

232
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,400
No, that's bollocks.

233
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
You can kid anyone...

234
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,600
Except a mate.

235
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,000
Whatever you do is all right with me.

236
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,100
- Do you mean that?
- I wouldn't have said it otherwise.

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Just don't start getting all
soppy on me, all right?

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,400
Anyway, I'm not getting any younger
and I'm fed up of carrying you.

239
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
- Well, yes.
- Yeah.

240
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,900
Although none of this makes a blind
bit of difference if he doesn't call.

241
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,000
Time for plan B?

242
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
William Cole.

243
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,500
Mr Cole, this is Madani Wasem.

244
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,800
Let me check my diary.

245
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
No, sorry, I can't do noon.

246
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Yeah, yeah, I can do 12.30.

247
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,700
OK, yeah, see you then.

248
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,000
***

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,600
Yeah, it's me. We're in.

250
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,600
Thank you, Emma.

251
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,100
I swear that girl could scam a space
shuttle if she set her mind to it.

252
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,400
You know, long before
"Con" Became a dirty word,

253
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,900
all it stood for was "Confidence".

254
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,400
And what's so bad about that?

255
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Now, I'm not saying that all
my peers are angels,

256
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,900
far from it!

257
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,900
But whatever industry you work in,

258
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,500
be it an office,
or a hospital, or a road gang

259
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,700
I guarantee you'll have
your share of rogues too.

260
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,000
We're criminals because
we work outside the law.

261
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Fine.

262
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,100
But what we do,
we can't do without greed.

263
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Take Madani Wasem for instance.

264
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,900
Now, he could buy his stocks and
his shares just like everyone else.

265
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,700
Pay the same price, take the same risk.

266
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,300
If he did, there's no
way we could touch him.

267
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,200
Honestly, do you think we could do what we
do if he wasn't looking for an edge?

268
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,700
If he wasn't looking for something that gave
him an unfair advantage over everyone else?

269
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,500
No. It's his greed that makes him fair game.

270
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,000
All we do, is feed that greed.

271
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,300
And the greedier he is,
the more we can take him for.

272
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
All we need to do now

273
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,500
is plan things and cover all the
angles so there are no surprises.

274
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
So how we doing?

275
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, Sean's out front, he'll give
us a heads up when they're here.

276
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,300
We doing a convincer?

277
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
I thought I'd freeze him out.

278
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,200
Do you think that's a good idea?

279
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,400
The more we drive him mad,
the more he'll want to break us.

280
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,900
I get the logic,

281
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,800
but this is a mark who has people
killed and your strategy is pissing him off.

282
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,700
I know what I'm doing.

283
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,300
Yeah?

284
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,100
He's here. And he's got some bird with him.

285
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
What bird?

286
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,300
"Fit" Doesn't help, Sean.
Any clue what she does?

287
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,100
No, no, it's OK, send 'em up.

288
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,900
If you'd just like to take the
elevator up to the sixth floor,

289
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,300
somebody will meet you there.

290
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,500
Thank you.

291
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,300
Mr Wasem?
Perfect, right this way, please.

292
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,800
Don't worry.
Don't worry, ok?

293
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,400
Take this one. When you get
back, all right, just call me,

294
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,900
we'll talk about it. Ok?

295
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,000
- Ok.
- Ok. Good, good.

296
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,300
Mr Wasem.
Very pleased to meet you.

297
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,200
This is my broker whilst I'm
in London, Yvonne Hammond.

298
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,200
- Ms Hammond.
- A pleasure.

299
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,400
So. Well, look,
we can, er...

300
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,900
Oh, Henry, for God's sake,

301
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,300
- leave it. Get out!
- I'm sorry

302
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,800
Get out! Out! Come on!

303
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,100
How quickly can
you leave an office?

304
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Terribly sorry about that,
must be hire a cretin week.

305
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,000
You stay.

306
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,700
I've been hearing a lot of good
things about you, Mr Cole.

307
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Oh?

308
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,600
People are very impressed with
the returns you've achieved

309
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,800
and in such a short space of time.

310
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, that's the beauty
of the markets isn't it?

311
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I mean, if you're well informed
and you're, you're quick enough,

312
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,700
all things are possible.

313
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,200
They talk to you like you're
the lowest form of life.

314
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Want to know where you are
every minute of the day,

315
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,100
run here, go there, do this, move that,
then they treat you like a muppet.

316
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,300
I know everything he does.

317
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,400
I know how he makes his money
and why everyone thinks he's golden bollocks.

318
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,100
What do I get for it?
Nothing. Just abuse.

319
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I don't suppose your bloke's
got any jobs going, has he?

320
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,700
- I do IT. Information exchange systems.
- I don't think so.

321
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,300
Yeah, well, if you hear of
anything, let us know, eh?

322
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,400
I'd love to be able to tell him
where to stick his job.

323
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,600
Mr Wasem is in London for three
days and whilst he's here,

324
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,200
he's very keen to make
some investments.

325
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
And?

326
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,300
He would be very interested to hear
if you have any advice to give him.

327
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,500
After discussing your fee, of course.

328
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,600
We do some business, yes?

329
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,100
Ah.

330
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,500
- Ah?
- Mmm, awkward.

331
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,700
I have a waiting list.

332
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,200
You have a waiting list?

333
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,400
- Yes.
- Do you know who I am?

334
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes, yes, but even so.

335
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,000
We understand that you must
have a very long list of people

336
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
eager to do business
with you, Mr Cole,

337
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,500
but we're equally sure
that you could find a way 

338
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,200
to make an exception
for Mr Wasem.

339
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,300
He asked me to wait in line!

340
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
I could go back in there and
speak to him.

341
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,700
No, screw him.

342
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
You.
Screw you.

343
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I will crush you.

344
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,100
Get the car.

345
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
I don't think he's very happy.

346
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,400
I do not know what you said
to him but he was not pleased.

347
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,600
- What have I missed?
- Does anyone know she was in London?

348
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,600
- No.
- I mean, we didn't know she was in the game

349
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,600
but did she know we were?

350
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,200
- She can't have known.
- Sorry, I've missed something here,

351
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
- like a meeting or something.
- We need to talk to her.

352
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,200
- Do we know where to find her?
- No. But she knows where to find us.

353
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,700
- You'll never guess what.
- Stacie's here.

354
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,500
- How does he, how does he do that?
- Mickey!

355
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,800
Your face was a picture.

356
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,700
Never thought I'd see
you speechless.

357
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,300
- Well, it was a bit of a shock.
- I'm sorry.

358
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,700
- Ash.
- Hello darlin'. Long time.

359
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,200
- Albie.
- You look magnificent and you feel even better.

360
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,400
Stacie, this is Emma
and Sean Kennedy.

361
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,500
- Hi.
- Hello.

362
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,200
- You all right?
- Ash has told me all about you.

363
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,100
He called occasionally.

364
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,500
Yeah, well, I'm not
good with small talk.

365
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Yes, so I noticed.

366
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,800
Where's Danny?

367
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,700
he fell in love with a
cocktail waitress in Santa Monica.

368
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,500
They were planning a summer wedding,
choosing names for their children.

369
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,500
Then her husband found out.

370
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,600
Last I heard, they were
heading for Vegas.

371
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
- Apparently, Danny had a plan.
- Yeah, I bet he did.

372
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,200
How long you been back?

373
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,500
Why didn't you tell us you were coming
and how long you staying?

374
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,400
A girl can't answer that many
questions without a drink.

375
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
I'll kill him.

376
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,100
I'll wipe every trace
of him off the Earth.

377
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
Now, you.

378
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,300
You, go and shoot him.

379
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,200
It's the UK, sir,
we can't carry guns.

380
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,500
- Where's my enforcer?
- I have found someone.

381
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
A Ukrainian, Alex Klukas,

382
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,800
he was recommended to me
by one of our men.

383
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,300
He has the details.

384
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,700
But there may also be another way.

385
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,600
*****

386
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,700
- So what you playing?
- Nothing fancy.

387
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,600
Just thought I'd siphon
off the top of whatever he invested,

388
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,100
get 10 or 20
grand and disappear.

389
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,700
- That's when you ran into us.
- Exactly.

390
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,000
Have you any idea how
angry you made him?

391
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,600
Yeah, I think so.

392
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
I don't know how far
along you are, Mickey,

393
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,700
but I'd think seriously about
walking away from this one.

394
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,200
Why?

395
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,100
There's just something about him.
He's not a very nice man.

396
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,800
Everyone's frightened of him.

397
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,200
- I've never met a nice mark yet.
- No, it's more than that.

398
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,900
We know he uses a hit man, he knocked
some bloke off two days ago.

399
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,700
- Exactly.
- We know what he's capable of.

400
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,500
It's a calculated risk.

401
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,600
- So are you going back?
- I don't know.

402
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,400
It ain't going to hurt,
having you on the inside, Stace.

403
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
That's true.

404
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,800
As far as I can see all you've done
so far is wind him up and make him furious.

405
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,600
Look, he's a bully.
So we take away his control,

406
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
you know, take away his power,
make him feel small.

407
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,100
And, then,
when he's ready to burst...

408
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,400
We find a way to give him
that control back.

409
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,700
How?

410
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,900
Just like that.

411
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,900
Hello?

412
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,600
We don't have to do this, you know,
we could bring him in another way.

413
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,500
- Yes, Mum. I'll be OK.
- I mean it.

414
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,600
Tell him what he wants to know
quickly, don't string it out.

415
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,900
This is our convincer, if he doesn't
have to work for it, he won't believe it.

416
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,200
- I know but you can make sure...
- Will you just stop?

417
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,100
I've been to the toilet, I've washed me hands
and I've got a clean hankie, all right?

418
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,300
All right.

419
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,700
Don't wait up.

420
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,300
Hello, how are you?

421
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,800
Good, thanks.

422
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,400
Barir said something about a job?

423
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,100
Yeah, of course.

424
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,200
Think of this as a job interview.

425
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Right.
OK.

426
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,200
Now Barir tells me that you know
how Mr Cole selects his investments.

427
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Er, yeah, well, kind of.

428
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,900
But I'm
not sure I should talk about that.

429
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh?

430
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,300
Well, it's not part of
my job, not really,

431
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,600
I do IT, you see.
I've, um, brought my CV.

432
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,700
There you go.

433
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,100
Let me ask you the question
in a different way.

434
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,200
You know how he selects
his investments.

435
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,500
I know what he does,

436
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,200
I heard him talking to the
yank but I don't know how.

437
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,600
Look, I swear, I don't know.

438
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,700
I know what his edge is, I know
why he never loses any money,

439
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,100
but how the whole thing works,
the mechanics, only he knows that.

440
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,700
You will tell me everything
you know about William Cole

441
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,400
and how he selects his investments.

442
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,700
???

443
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,400
Every detail.

444
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,400
You leave nothing out.

445
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,100
Do you understand?

446
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,900
Oh, Jesus!

447
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,600
I think he's convinced.

448
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,400
I'm not going to meet you.

449
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,700
Sorry, sir, you don't
have an appointment!

450
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,100
I don't need one.

451
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,700
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sit down and shut up.

452
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm so sorry!
He won't listen to me.

453
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,500
- Call security.
- Call whoever you want, you piece of shit.

454
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Because the second
after you throw me out,

455
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
I'm going to tell the police
about how you're intercepting data

456
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,500
from the London Stock Exchange.

457
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Which would put you out of business
and into prison.

458
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Sir?

459
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,800
yeah, it's, er, it's OK,
Alice, take the rest of the day off.

460
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,100
Close the door behind you.

461
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,500
Now he wants a meeting.
Now he wants to talk.

462
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,800
Well, maybe I don't want
to do business.

463
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,100
Maybe I got a waiting list.

464
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,500
Look, I didn't mean to offend you.

465
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,600
No?

466
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,100
Well, I'm about to offend you.
Talk to him.

467
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,200
Mr Wasem is a very reasonable man

468
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,600
and he has no wish for things
to be anything other than cordial.

469
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,100
It's very lucky for you I'm a
reasonable man, you horse's ass.

470
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,300
But he insists that you show him
how the data is intercepted

471
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,000
and how you use this data to
choose which investments you make.

472
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,600
Before I do anything at all, I want to
know how you came by this information.

473
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
That is none of your business.

474
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,500
You just show me how it works.

475
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,700
I can't do that

476
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,100
because there
are other people involved.

477
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,400
Let me explain something
to you, Mr Golden Balls.

478
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,000
It would give me great pleasure

479
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,700
to just tell the police
everything I know and I can go home.

480
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,900
Or I can forget about the police

481
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and just shoot you

482
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,200
and everyone you love in the head.

483
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,500
The only thing that's
stopping me from doing that

484
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,300
is the thought that I can
make some money here.

485
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,900
So you, you got
a very simple choice.

486
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,900
You can either show me
how the interception works

487
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
or you can go to prison

488
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,500
or you be dead.

489
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,700
All right, I'll need some time.

490
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,300
Of course.

491
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,500
You have a minute.

492
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,300
- Have you gone insane?
- I had no choice, they know.

493
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
- How?
- That doesn't matter.

494
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,700
All that's important

495
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,600
is that you show me
what I came to see.

496
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,500
I'm sorry, there's no other way.

497
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
This is it?

498
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,700
This cable carries a live feed into the
stock exchange building next door.

499
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,800
??? There was a fault in the system

500
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,800
and George was sent over from the company
in Houston who supplied the software.

501
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,700
His team had to dig up the cable

502
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,700
so that they could fit a new
digital transcoder unit.

503
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,200
When we did, I realised with an
exposed cable and the right software,

504
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,600
we could manipulate the data
that passes through it.

505
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,500
This is a hard drive.

506
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,400
It records all of the data coming in

507
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,800
and holds it up for nine tenths of a second
before playing it on down the line.

508
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,600
- To the stock exchange?
- Exactly.

509
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,900
It holds it up long enough
for us to analyse it

510
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,400
and identify any major shifts,
trends or movements,

511
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,200
before playing it on to the
stock exchange boards.

512
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
It's also hooked up to
our trading account,

513
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,300
so it can make purchases
based on those calculations.

514
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,100
Wait. You're saying you
can analyse the data

515
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,100
and actually purchase stocks before
the stock exchange gets the same information?

516
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,900
That's exactly what I'm saying.

517
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
But that's, that's genius.

518
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,400
Can this be done?

519
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,300
Well, if,
if what they're saying is true.

520
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,000
- It's absolutely true.
- And there's no risk. Ever.

521
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,100
We only ever buy stock
we know is going to rise.

522
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,700
And presumably you can off-load before
anyone else if it starts to go down?

523
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,700
We don't hold on to it that long, we
just make our profits and get out.

524
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,400
OK, I'm in.

525
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,000
You're in?
In for what?

526
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,600
You will make investments for me.

527
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,300
Look, I'm sorry,
it's not that simple.

528
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,300
I heard you in the restaurant.

529
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,700
You said you have a
capacity for ten million.

530
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,600
Well, yes, I mean, that's the top
end of our buying power but...

531
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
But what?

532
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,000
Well, even if we had
that kind of money,

533
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
which, by the way, we don't,
we'd never go over a million,

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
we don't want to draw
attention to ourselves.

535
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,000
That's because you're a horse's ass.

536
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,000
You will invest the full ten million.

537
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,600
- Ten million?
- Hedge fund managers invest hundreds of millions in a day,

538
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,400
why would anyone notice ten?

539
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Because we're private brokers
trading for private investors.

540
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,200
Then you buy the stock in my name,

541
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,800
no-one will question that level
of investment if it's from me.

542
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,300
You take my ten million,
you double it.

543
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,200
Look, well I'd need all
the money in the account.

544
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,600
- And the returns?
- They'd go to the same account.

545
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,900
Miss Hammond will put
everything in place.

546
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,100
Look, I don't know, we'd have to
programme in a new trading account,

547
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,300
- and re-set the buying criteria.
- Then do it.

548
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,200
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
what do we get out of this, huh?

549
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Yeah, I mean we still
get our commission, right?

550
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,400
Er, 22%. Cash.

551
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,600
- Five per cent.
- What?

552
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,700
Perhaps the experience will
teach you some manners.

553
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,900
You call me when it's ready.

554
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
OK, once the money is
in the trading account,

555
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,000
I want two men watching
Cole around the clock.

556
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,200
Yes, sir.

557
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,500
I want you to learn how
they programme the machine.

558
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,300
Me? Why?

559
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,700
Because once you can use it,

560
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,600
I'll have no further use for Cole
and the old man.

561
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,800
Wait.

562
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,400
I don't mind bending the
rules to make money,

563
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,000
the City's corrupt anyway.

564
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,700
But I won't be a party to murder.

565
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,300
Would you rather 
I asked someone else?

566
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,100
Cos then, I wouldn't need you either.

567
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
No.

568
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,300
Then just do it.

569
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
Call my enforcer,
get him on a plane.

570
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,100
OK, time to bail out.

571
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,700
- You what?
- He wants me to learn how to programme the machine.

572
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,800
So that he can have you killed.

573
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Well, that's kind of
what we expected.

574
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,300
He told Barir to call the
enforcer and whatever you do,

575
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,400
he's not going to let you
out of his sight.

576
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,100
I know.

577
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,600
From tomorrow morning he'll have
two of his guards on you full time.

578
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Even if you pull this off,
you'll never get away clean.

579
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,000
This is wicked.

580
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,700
Without a doubt, this is one of the
coolest things I've ever tried on.

581
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,500
I actually look like I could
swim faster than a shark!

582
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,500
- All right, Stace?
- Hi.

583
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,100
Just for the record,

584
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,500
this isn't an accurate
representation of my underwear.

585
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,400
Pleased to hear it.

586
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,300
He's got issues, from
when he was a baby.

587
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,300
I do not have issues.

588
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,100
Mickey, I don't like it.

589
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
- It feels wrong.
- What about the money?

590
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,700
He's having it transferred first thing
tomorrow before the markets open.

591
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,600
He's also bringing 500,000
in cash which is your commission

592
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,900
- if you double him up.
- OK.

593
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,100
I tell you someone's planning to have
you killed and all you say is OK?

594
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,300
You're taking ten million
from this man, Mickey,

595
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,700
he's not going to just put it down
to experience and walk away.

596
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,400
I know Wasem won't just walk away.

597
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,400
Which is why it's a good reason

598
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,700
for us all to lay low for a bit.

599
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,500
So, I was thinking,
when this job is done,

600
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,800
we should take a break.

601
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Go our separate ways for a while.

602
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,900
- How long's a while?
- Who knows?

603
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
I thought it best
not to make plans.

604
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,400
I was going to talk to you about
this when the job was done but...

605
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,700
seems now is as good a time as any.

606
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,700
So, that's why we're taking this
job? It's walking away money?

607
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,300
- If you want to call it that.
- That's it, then?

608
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,700
One last job
and we're finished, huh?

609
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,700
I've always thought it was a good
idea to quit while you're ahead.

610
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,800
I think ten million
qualifies as being ahead.

611
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,300
This is the question.

612
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,500
If you didn't take this break,

613
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,600
would you still do the job?

614
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,900
If I'm honest.

615
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,000
No, I wouldn't.

616
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,800
And I wouldn't blame any one of you
that wanted to walk away right now.

617
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,100
But, come on!
The money comes in tomorrow.

618
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,200
Our play is that the
City of London police

619
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,400
has had us under surveillance.

620
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,100
Ash has lined up a dozen
grifters and all the vehicles.

621
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,300
We get ourselves arrested
but we let Wasem get away.

622
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,000
He'll go straight to the airport,
desperate to leave the country,

623
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,300
thinking the money's been impounded,
there's nothing to keep him here,

624
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,800
where as we, on the other hand,

625
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,700
will cash in and be long gone

626
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,700
by the time the dust settles.

627
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,900
It will work.
Trust me.

628
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,800
Hello.

629
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,700
We have a job.

630
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,300
Stay in your room,
I will send over a package.

631
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,800
- You OK?
- Yeah.

632
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,900
So, it must be nice
to see Stacie again.

633
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,200
- Yeah, yeah, it is.
- Yeah, Ash told me that you two, um,

634
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,300
- you were quite close for a while.
- Yeah, we were.

635
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,500
- Yeah, you go back a long way.
- Yeah, that's right.

636
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,100
So, this, er, whole break thing.

637
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,600
You know the whole, um,
going our own way thing.

638
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,700
Only it's a bit sudden
and it's a bit like,

639
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,600
Stacie turning up the way she has
and I just, I...I was wondering

640
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,400
if the two things were
related in any way.

641
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,200
It's just curiosity, really,
It's a good job I'm not a cat.

642
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,100
- No, the thing, the thing is...
- No, it's not.

643
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,300
- It's not what?
- Related.

644
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,500
OK.

645
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,100
It's just... I want to live
a normal life for a while.

646
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,800
Get to know people
for who they are.

647
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,700
Not constantly look at them and see
if they'd make a great mark or not.

648
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
So, it's more like a holiday, really?

649
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,000
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Yeah, so we could still, you know, like,

650
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,400
meet up and spend time together
and...and chill.

651
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,800
I'd like that.

652
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,300
Me too.

653
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,100
 Then the work thing wouldn't
be there any more, would it?

654
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,100
No, it wouldn't.

655
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,600
And if everything goes right tomorrow,
then you know, we'll be stinking rich.

656
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,900
Yes, we will.

657
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,600
So, at some point,
we could be talking

658
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,600
you and me, and a desert island and,

659
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,800
like, a couple of million
in the bank or something.

660
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,200
That doesn't sound
too shabby, does it?

661
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,200
No, it doesn't.

662
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,200
OK, good.

663
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,000
Great, well, then I'll just
leave you to your thinking.

664
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,400
I just thought I'd ask.

665
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,900
I'm really glad you did.

666
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,500
OK, so you go when Albert calls
Nick to give him the thumbs up.

667
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Hard and fast, OK?
Lots of noise.

668
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,400
We need them scared enough
to run straight to the airport.

669
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,400
Everyone in cuffs and
dragged out to the vans.

670
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,600
So, we're going to be outside
the London Stock Exchange, in broad daylight,

671
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,700
so it won't be
long before the real old bill notice.

672
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,500
So, don't hang about, get them
in the vans and on your way.

673
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,000
The mark is last up.

674
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,400
He'll be with his
bodyguard and Stacie.

675
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,700
Stacie will offer to
bribe Nick at that point

676
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,300
and that's when you let them go.

677
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,100
- Is that all clear?
- Yeah.

678
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,300
Right, get yourselves in position.

679
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,200
Good luck.

680
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,000
All right?

681
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,400
- Nice one.
- Take care, Albert.

682
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,200
So, Stacie called.

683
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,900
The money's in the trading account
but when we get there,

684
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,400
Wasem needs to put his pin number in,
before we can move it.

685
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
OK.

686
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,500
We'll clear out of the penthouse and
meet at the hotel when it's done.

687
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,600
We'll split the money by
direct transfer, and then...

688
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,900
all go our separate ways.

689
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,600
- Everyone know what they're doing?
- Right.

690
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,400
What about me?

691
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Eh?

692
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,800
Everyone's talking about
the biggest job ever,

693
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,600
you know, history in the making and all that
and everyone's got something to do except me.

694
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,600
Even the bloody dogs
have got a part.

695
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,700
Yeah, yeah, well, er, there's a reason
we haven't given you anything yet, Ed.

696
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,100
- Yeah?
- Because we've saved the best till last.

697
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,200
Ah, see, I thought it'd be
something like that.

698
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,200
So, what? Do I get like
a uniform, an' all that?

699
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,800
No, you won't need one,

700
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,300
you see, the most important
part of your job...

701
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,100
is to have the drinks ready and on
the table for when we get back.

702
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,100
Good luck, Ed.

703
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,100
Sir, we need your pin.

704
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,100
Thank you.

705
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,200
OK.
Three minutes.

706
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,200
- That it?
- Yeah. Like we were never here.

707
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,500
What's happening with my money?

708
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,600
It's all right.

709
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,100
It's buying.

710
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Are we ready to do the transfer?

711
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,800
So, now, we transferring his ten million
from the trading account, into our account.

712
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,700
- Hi.
- Hello.

713
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,900
- We have a reservation,
under the name of Jones.
- OK.

714
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,400
This is the most fun I've ever had.
You know what?

715
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,400
I think we come back tomorrow,
we do it all over again.

716
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Stay where you are!
Get on the floor! Down now!

717
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,400
Armed Police! Nobody move!

718
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,500
You are under arrest on suspicion of fraud.

719
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,800
Come on.
Come on.

720
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,700
- This has nothing to do with us.
- All right, darlin', tell it to the judge.

721
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,600
No, no, no, I mean it.

722
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,700
They did it, they have this machine,
they wanted us to invest.

723
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,200
That's what happened,
she's telling the truth!

724
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,900
- We didn't even give them the money.
- Hold up.

725
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,000
Bring 'em back.

726
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,400
Take the rest of them away.

727
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,500
It was...it was just
a demonstration,

728
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,700
we only met them yesterday.

729
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,500
They were trying to convince
us to invest but we didn't.

730
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,000
Open the bag, you can
see for yourself.

731
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,500
- So, this is your money?
- Yes.

732
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,000
B-But it doesn't have to be.
It could be yours.

733
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,000
So, if it just disappeared.

734
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,900
There is half a million pounds
in cash in that bag, so...

735
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,800
If you let us go we won't
even look back, I swear.

736
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,800
I've got a jet fuelled
and ready to leave,

737
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,000
I can be out of the
country in an hour.

738
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,600
You've got the machine,
the people who built it.

739
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,900
Why do you need us?

740
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,600
Our friend's on his
way to the airport.

741
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,100
Stacie's going to lose him and
meet you back at the hotel.

742
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,700
You son of a bitch, you did it.

743
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,200
Hold tight.

744
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,300
You did well.

745
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,000
Just get on the plane before
they change their mind.

746
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,500
We're back.

747
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,500
- Ah. Hey.
- Ha-ha-ha.

748
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,000
Current balance, ten million pounds.

749
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,700
- Yes!
- And he gave us half a mill commission
in cash for taking it off him.

750
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,600
Yeah-hey.

751
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,400
???

752
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,300
Thank you, my dear.

753
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,500
- To us. To us!
- Yeah, yeah! Woo hoo!

754
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,700
They've just gone into the hotel.
No. No police.

755
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,700
- Ah, taste of victory.
- Scary. Scary.

756
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,300
Guys, get out.

757
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,900
Go. Go, go, move.

758
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,300
Come on, Albert.

759
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,300
Mickey Bricks,

760
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,700
if you've ever been brilliant,
please be brilliant now.

761
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,100
Gentlemen. I know what
you're thinking but, er...

762
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,200
That's my money. That's my money.
Come on, come on.

763
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,700
I guess most of you
must have thought that,

764
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,000
one day, it would end like this.

765
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,300
Which, without an extraordinary
amount of planning,

766
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,700
it very well might have done.

767
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,500
Come on, then. Off your arses.
Wakey wakey.

768
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,600
Honestly, eh?

769
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,600
What would you lot do without me coming
to bale you out of trouble all the time?

770
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,500
I mean it's all right Mickey
doing all that,

771
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,900
"Look at me, I'm a clever bastard"
stuff, but when it comes down to it.

772
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,400
You just can't do it
without me, can you?

773
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,900
- Are you sure you couldn't find anyone else?
- I'm sorry.

774
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,200
Hello. Who's this? Very pretty.
Hello, sweetheart.

775
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,800
I'm Danny. Danny Blue.
Probably heard a lot about me.

776
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,800
Call my enforcer,
get him on a plane.

777
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,000
- Alex Klukas?
- I'm here.

778
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,300
Hello, Mickey.

779
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,500
Try this on.

780
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,700
Just for the record, this isn't an
accurate representation of my underwear.

781
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
I want you to learn how
they programme the machine.

782
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,500
How does the machine work?

783
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,300
Well, basically, it's a box
with a bunch of lights in it.

784
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,000
I thought it might be.

785
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Gentlemen.
I know what you're thinking.

786
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,800
Come on then, off your arses.

787
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:20,400
- Did you, er, did you throw it all over?
- Nah, fifty grand or so.

788
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Er, now might be a good
time to slip away.

789
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,200
I think that's a fabulous idea.

790
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,700
How about, me and you, we
just slip away together?

791
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,100
Danny, behave.

792
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,200
Easy pal, that's my sister.

793
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,500
Whoa, everybody's a bit
touchy, ain't they?

794
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,700
I didn't have to use blanks,
you know, I did think about it.

795
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,700
- How you doing, Albie?
- Pretty good, Danny, pretty good.

796
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,700
- I'm sorry I had to shoot you.
- Don't worry about it.

797
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,200
I blame Mickey.
He's very theatrical.

798
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,600
- Someone shut him up.
- It was OTT, that's all I'm saying.

799
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,900
- We were still being watched. 
- Exactly.

800
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,200
Always playing to the audience.

801
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,500
Listen, listen, mate, when you've
taken someone for ten million,

802
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,500
the only way you can be sure they're not
coming after you is if they think you're dead.

803
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,400
Ten million?

804
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,100
Is this a good time
to talk about my cut?

805
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,400
I think we'd better be going.

806
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,600
Time we should make a move, come on.

807
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,800
Wahey. Yeah.

808
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,600
- I've just had an amazing and original idea.
- God, help us.

809
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,400
Bear with me, right, one, two,
three, there's seven of us, right?

810
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,200
We should hook up. We'll start
a new gang,

811
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,200
maybe I'll lead it, we'll call it....

812
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,300
The Magnificent Seven.

813
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,200
What d'you think, Albert?

814
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,200
I think that's a hell of an idea.

815
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
- What about The Great Eight?
- To The Great Eight.

816
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,300
So, that's it.
I'm out of here.

817
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,100
I hope you've picked up
a few things along the way.

818
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,200
If something seems too good to
be true, it almost certainly is.

819
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,100
Always look a gift horse in the mouth.

820
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,400
Unless you don't much care
whether it has teeth or not.

821
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,800
And, remember, you can't
cheat an honest man.

822
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,200
So, if you bend the rules
to make some easy money,

823
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,500
you deserve what you get.

824
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,400
Oh, and, er, don't believe
everything people tell you.

825
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,700
Whoever they are.

826
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,200
Think things through for yourself.

827
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,700
Is it for real?

828
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,000
Is someone telling you
that story for a reason?

829
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Or...are they
having you right at it?

830
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,000
But most important of all...

831
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,100
Whether it's business...

832
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,900
- Buying.
- Selling.

833
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,500
- Whether it's someone you know.
- Or someone you don't.

834
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,000
Even if it's love.

835
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,000
Never be a mark.
