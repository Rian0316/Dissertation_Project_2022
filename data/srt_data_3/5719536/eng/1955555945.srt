1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,132
Previously on AMC's
"Better Call Saul"...

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:06,875
You do realize you just
confessed to a felony?

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,988
For this, you destroyed our family?

4
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:12,112
You happy now?!

5
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,437
- Jimmy!
- What are you gonna do?

6
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:15,768
- He's got me boxed in.
- You can fight this.

7
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,344
I regret it all, more
than you can imagine,

8
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:20,269
'cause you're my brother.

9
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:22,356
I'm filing a motion
to suppress that tape.

10
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:24,725
Motions aside, that tape will be played.

11
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:26,235
Well?

12
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:28,573
Bingo.

13
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,491
Found a phone!

14
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:03,014
It looks like it's from
1967, but I think it'll work.

15
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:05,077
Just a sec, Jimmy.

16
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:07,585
Excellent. Thank you
for being so careful.

17
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:08,986
- Sir.
- Hmm?

18
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:10,955
- We have to get in your attic.
- For what?

19
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:12,264
Oh, the hook-up.

20
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:13,455
Oh, no. That's all right. Don't bother.

21
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:14,826
Oh, it won't take 20 minutes.

22
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:16,419
Plus, you really can't
use it if I don't do it.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,221
No, it's all right. We're not gonna...

24
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,622
Uh, when you're done here,

25
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,324
would you get some more
lamps in the garage?

26
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:22,957
Thanks.

27
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:25,461
- So, we got a phone.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:26,676
The yard's half-mowed.

29
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:28,831
Uh, the sockets and
stuff are looking a-ok.

30
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,933
I'm gonna check again just to make sure.

31
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,235
We're almost there.

32
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:33,302
Good. Good.

33
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:35,772
Um, what do you think?

34
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:38,141
On? Off?

35
00:01:38,142 --> 00:01:41,177
Ohh. I think... off.

36
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:43,980
Yeah. You're right. Off it is.

37
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,534
- Chuck.
- Hmm?

38
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,307
You sure this is the right play?

39
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,651
I mean, in my experience,

40
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:52,677
the bigger the lie, the
harder it can be to dig out.

41
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,677
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

42
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,930
Hey, guys, think we're
set with the lamps.

43
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:04,632
Uh, could someone give me a
hand with this phone? Gracias.

44
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,196
Mmm.

45
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:20,942
It's open!

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,917
Rebecca.

47
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,989
- Chuck.
- You look lovely.

48
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,556
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- And you.

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,364
- Oh.
- Hey,

50
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:39,098
what's with the candles?

51
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,442
Why you sittin' here in the dark?

52
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:42,031
Ye, I was wondering the same thing.

53
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:45,331
Oh, my God, the afternoon I've had.

54
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:47,526
Two hours ago, I take the sea bass out.

55
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,229
No sooner is it prepped and resting

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,675
then, boom... power goes down.

57
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:54,963
I get on the phone to the city.

58
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:56,387
To make a long story short,

59
00:03:56,388 --> 00:03:59,615
those bozos at PNM mixed up my payment.

60
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,518
The deadbeat at 512 San Cristobal

61
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,287
hasn't been paying his bills.

62
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:05,888
And, of course, I'm...

63
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,706
- 215. Mm-hmm. Mm.
- 215, exactly.

64
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,860
They say they'll have
it on again by tomorrow.

65
00:04:10,861 --> 00:04:14,297
In the meantime, I borrowed some
camping gear from my neighbors.

66
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:16,725
Hence, the rustic flair.

67
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:17,967
- Jeez.
- Oh, yeah.

68
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,402
So, what do we do?

69
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:21,607
Uh, get out of here
and go to a restaurant?

70
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,222
We could hit Seasons. Your treat.

71
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,545
We could, yeah.

72
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,945
But, um, you know,
dinner's almost ready.

73
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:31,213
And the fish... I would have
just had to throw it out.

74
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:32,882
All I have to do is toss it in a pan.

75
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:34,617
How about we just rough it?

76
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:35,952
Huh? You okay with that?

77
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,753
Uh, um...

78
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:40,823
Well... why not? It'll be fun.

79
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:43,626
We'll do an haute-cuisine camp-out.

80
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:46,410
Great! Then it's settled.
Let me take that. Take your...

81
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,681
- Oh, yeah, here. Oh, thank you.
- Here, I'll take that.

82
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:49,715
Mm-hmm.

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,667
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

84
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,277
Oh, my God.

85
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:58,045
I can't eat another bite.

86
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:02,234
Cheers to the Galloping Gourmet.

87
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,676
- Mm!
- Ah.

88
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:04,810
Yeah.

89
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,711
Mm.

90
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:08,926
The Calvados is perfect.

91
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,324
Mm. You always liked it.

92
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,677
Here.

93
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:14,091
Uh, um...

94
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:15,185
- Let me get this.
- No, no, Jimmy.

95
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,535
- You don't have to.
- No, least I can do...

96
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,245
- is the dishes.
- Oh.

97
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,840
Thank you.

98
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,078
Thanks, Jimmy.

99
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:28,022
This turned out better than I thought.

100
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,769
Uh, I'm so... sorry about the lights.

101
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,943
Oh, it's nice. Atmospheric.

102
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,110
I mean, I still can't get
over Jimmy being a lawyer.

103
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,821
Neither can I.

104
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:41,948
He's got his own shingle
out and everything.

105
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,659
I mean, a real, responsible citizen.

106
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,484
I mean, who woulda thought?

107
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:47,142
Yeah.

108
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:50,587
Mm.

109
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,192
This place is the same.

110
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:55,659
I mean, I-I would've thought you'd...

111
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,852
change things up.

112
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,343
Move things around.

113
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:03,445
You've got great taste.
And if it ain't broke...

114
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:05,671
How's the tour going?

115
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:06,813
It's good. Good.

116
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,638
- Um, the Far East this fall.
- Oh.

117
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,976
Uh, China, South Korea, and Vietnam.

118
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:12,848
- That's gonna be exciting.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:15,324
And then, um, after Santa Fe this week,

120
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,252
- uh, we're back to Central Europe.
- And it's good?

121
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,031
- Well, it's a lot of hotels.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:22,266
I mean, in Budapest,
I think I saw mostly

123
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:25,339
the inside of the concert
hall and the Marriott.

124
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,039
But, you know, I shouldn't complain.

125
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,434
You're not complaining.
You're observing.

126
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:36,314
Did you finally get to see Salzburg?

127
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:39,065
Not yet, but next month, after Vienna.

128
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,619
Do you remember when we
tried to go to Salzburg?

129
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,046
And that crazy old
lady on the scooter...

130
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:46,839
- Oh, yes! Yes!
- Chased us out of the train station.

131
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,528
Yeah! And then, um...

132
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:50,065
and then we went and got, uh,

133
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:53,651
it was a-a-a raspberry
Linzer torte in Innsbruck?

134
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:55,417
- Mm.
- To make ourselves feel better?

135
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:57,635
Mm. You said, "We'll never finish this!"

136
00:06:57,636 --> 00:06:59,209
And then we did.

137
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,690
So, what's after Asia? Any
plans for a stateside tour?

138
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,128
Oh, you know, hopefully next year.

139
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,981
You know, maybe a residency.
Oh, that would be sweet.

140
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:11,415
I mean, you know, I like the buses

141
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,497
and trains and planes fine,

142
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,420
but I, um...

143
00:07:15,574 --> 00:07:19,568
I miss having one...
one place to hang my hat.

144
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,031
Oh, God!

145
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:29,667
I'm sorry. I-I-I hate that thing.

146
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:33,203
I feel like I'm on a leash. Ugh!

147
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,221
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,651
Oh. Oh, it's my conductor.

149
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:43,503
Um, I have to take this. I'm sorry.

150
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,016
H-Hi, Andre.

151
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:47,873
No, I'm just at dinner. What's up?

152
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:49,654
Well, I can do that at rehearsal.

153
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:51,839
Yeah, no problem. Yeah.

154
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,159
No, I-I know that they're
coming in late on bar 16.

155
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,695
Y-Yeah. Got it. Got it.

156
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:59,530
I will make sure that...

157
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:01,365
Uh, c-c-can you hold on a second?

158
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,087
Let me just get a pen.

159
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,917
Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,847
Yeah. No, I-I...

161
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,308
Yeah, hold on one second.

162
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:12,410
Yeah, I can do it... I
mean, whatever you need.

163
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,011
Mm-hmm. Okay.

164
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,612
All right, shoot.

165
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:18,848
Okay...

166
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:22,016
Chuck?

167
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,254
I'm all right.

168
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:26,324
Well, do you want me to
rehearse the cellists separately?

169
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:28,191
Rebecca. Rebecca.

170
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:33,764
Well, no, it's not just
him. It's the whole section.

171
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,438
Rebecca!

172
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,701
Uh, no.

173
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:38,713
T-That's fine.

174
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:40,371
Yeah.

175
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:42,933
Chuck, what the hell?!

176
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:47,078
Andre?

177
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,413
I-I-I have to... I'll
have to call you back.

178
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:51,290
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:55,354
What is your problem?

180
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,638
Say something.

181
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,630
It is incredibly bad manners

182
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:08,566
to answer a cellphone in company.

183
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,576
It's very rude.

184
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:13,772
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

185
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:16,788
I-I didn't know that you felt that way.

186
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,024
I... didn't mean to offend you, Chuck.

187
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:22,193
I-I may have overreacted.

188
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,265
- That was very abrupt. Uh..
- No.

189
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:26,501
I understand.

190
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:30,055
Uh...

191
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,236
It's getting late.

192
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:33,771
Thank you for a lovely dinner,

193
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,164
but I should be getting
back to the hotel.

194
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:38,109
Just gimme a minute, and we can...

195
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,278
No. Uh, um, I'll just get a cab.

196
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,469
I don't want to put you out
any more than I already...

197
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,481
- Please, let me.
- No, really.

198
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,882
A cab is the easiest.

199
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:49,096
You gotta do somethin'.

200
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,880
Y-You can't let her leave like this.

201
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,391
- Just tell her what's going on.
- No. No.

202
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,992
She'll understand.

203
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,628
She'll... Would you rather
she think you're a raging prick

204
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,034
than know the truth?

205
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:00,646
No.

206
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,667
Look, if you won't
tell her, then I will.

207
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,569
No, no. No!

208
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,615
You will not tell her.

209
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:10,357
You... will not tell her.

210
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:12,709
All right.

211
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,456
Hi, Andre. Yes, I'm sorry about that.

212
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:17,690
I dropped the phone.

213
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:31,556
<font color="#00FFFF">STRVINARKA</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.strvinarka.com

214
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:51,036
Jesus. What're you doing, man?

215
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:52,950
There's barely any oxygen in that bag.

216
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,269
- You're suffocating her!
- "Her"?

217
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,379
Yeah, just because you
don't see swingin' dicks

218
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,714
doesn't mean you can't tell
a boy fish from a girl fish.

219
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:01,942
Oh, yeah, see.

220
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:04,073
Now I can see the lipstick.

221
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:07,445
This is a living creature.
It's not a piece of furniture.

222
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:09,437
So, after this, you take her home.

223
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:11,969
You put her in a big
bowl, at least a gallon.

224
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,922
Get a good bubbler,

225
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,492
maybe a plecostomus.

226
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:17,187
And don't feed her too much.

227
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:18,349
People get fat.

228
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,575
Fish, they drown in leftover food.

229
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:22,577
All right already, Jacques Cousteau.

230
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:23,945
Point made.

231
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:25,679
Good.

232
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:30,919
I'm guessing our friend
didn't refer you to me

233
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,882
to get ichthyological advice.

234
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:36,925
I'm looking for someone
with a light touch.

235
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:40,090
I'm not talking some teenager
taking a five-finger discount

236
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:41,619
on string cheese at the Stop 'N' Shop.

237
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,989
I need highly skilled,

238
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,601
high-end, discreet.

239
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:48,552
A real pro.

240
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,746
You gotta fit him in a tight space?

241
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:53,914
I don't think so.

242
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:58,114
I got just the guy, then.

243
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,198
That's why I say golfing
is a contact sport.

244
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:23,171
Great job, Ms. Wexler. Very refreshing.

245
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:26,131
Believe me, uh, we're happy
to get this one off the docket.

246
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:27,876
Not as happy as we are.

247
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,377
Again, great job.

248
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:31,726
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

249
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:38,352
Ladies, dinner's on me.

250
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:41,590
Kim, I knew you were good, but
I didn't know you were this good.

251
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,925
Oh, I'm glad you're happy.

252
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:45,296
We couldn't have done it without you.

253
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,780
And I hope you realize this means

254
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,830
a whole lot a work comin' your way.

255
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:51,944
Oh, that's... that's great.

256
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:55,062
Well, you don't sound like it's great.

257
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,746
I hate to be a buzzkill, but...

258
00:12:57,747 --> 00:13:00,675
there is something you need to
hear before we get any deeper in.

259
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:04,037
It's about your former
attorney, Charles McGill.

260
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:05,363
What about him?

261
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:08,303
Charles has been making
some very ugly allegations

262
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,332
about his brother, Jimmy,

263
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,754
with whom I happen to
share an office space.

264
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:16,194
Allegations? Of what?

265
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:19,043
Charles thinks that Jimmy

266
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:20,809
somehow took control of your documents

267
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,170
while he was working
on them at his home.

268
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:24,966
He believes Jimmy transposed
the address numbers.

269
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:27,481
Transposed the numbers?

270
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:30,237
How would he even do that?

271
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:33,496
Charles contends that
Jimmy took the documents

272
00:13:33,497 --> 00:13:34,776
pertaining to the Rosella branch

273
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:37,215
and, while Charles was indisposed,

274
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,902
photocopied and doctored them.

275
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,651
That's pretty baroque.

276
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:44,119
The important thing here

277
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,598
is I think it could make
some noise in public.

278
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,922
Soon.

279
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:49,873
I wanted to tell you this in
the spirit of full disclosure.

280
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:52,702
I thought it was better
if you heard it from me.

281
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:57,752
If you have any reservations
at this point, or...

282
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,602
if you are not comfortable
staying with me,

283
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,004
we can discuss options.

284
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,931
If there's one thing I cannot abide,

285
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,909
it's a man who won't
own up to his mistakes.

286
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,829
Now, whatever mud McGill is slinging

287
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,283
he's not gonna screw
me out of the best...

288
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:21,385
outside counsel I've ever had.

289
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,259
That's...

290
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,900
I'm so glad to hear that.

291
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,384
We appreciate the heads-up, but
you can call this baby put to bed.

292
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:30,265
Now the most important thing... dinner.

293
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,298
7:00 good for you?

294
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,302
- Uh, works for me.
- Great.

295
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:35,870
We'll talk strategy...

296
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,570
We move on Colorado or Utah first?

297
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:40,612
See ya at 7:00.

298
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:42,697
This McGill thing.

299
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:46,205
You're sure it's not gonna be a problem?

300
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,288
I am.

301
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:51,799
Mesa Verde isn't involved
in any way, shape, or form.

302
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:55,367
Okay. Good.

303
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:57,125
Then, I'll see you tonight.

304
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:59,471
Okay, great. See you then.

305
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,427
Okay, this is it.

306
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:20,167
We can run without lights and mics.

307
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,425
We'll collect all cellphones

308
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,318
and hold them for the
duration of your testimony.

309
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:25,520
The, uh, court reporter,
would it be possible

310
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:27,922
to move him or her farther
from the witness stand?

311
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:29,675
Um, yeah, I think we can arrange

312
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:32,014
having them in the back of the court.

313
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:35,063
I'm sorry. There's nothing I
can do about the exit signs.

314
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,264
It's code.

315
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:39,399
I appreciate all
you're doing. Thank you.

316
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,183
Mr. Alley, I wonder if
you'd give us a moment.

317
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,911
I'd like to go over
something with my colleague.

318
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:47,623
No problem. I'll be
outside when you're ready.

319
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,547
Howard?

320
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,747
How you feeling, Chuck?

321
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:57,419
- I'll muddle through.
- Because this is a lot to ask.

322
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,422
And if you're not up to it...
just throwing this out there...

323
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,090
maybe you don't need to testify at all.

324
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,226
No, I do.

325
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,609
I'm the only person who
can adequately explain

326
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,017
the context of that tape.

327
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:09,531
Otherwise, the defense'll
tear it to shreds.

328
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:11,199
It's already a solid case.

329
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,173
We have Jimmy's statement from
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion.

330
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,170
There's my testimony
and the private eye's.

331
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:20,708
Maybe there's no need to put you
through the wringer like this.

332
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,778
This isn't about me or my health.

333
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:26,307
This is about PR.

334
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,795
We lost a client.

335
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:32,587
That happened because, while
you were... incapacitated,

336
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:34,134
your brother accessed documents

337
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:37,331
that should have been secured at HHM.

338
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:40,953
What Jimmy did is unconscionable, yes...

339
00:16:40,954 --> 00:16:44,566
but one of my jobs is to
safeguard the firm's reputation.

340
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,189
This is not the time to
worry about how we look.

341
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,104
This is about what's
right and what's wrong.

342
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:52,307
I'm not gonna risk Jimmy getting, what?

343
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:55,510
A year's suspension? Maybe two?

344
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:59,500
He deserves disbarment,
not some slap on the wrist.

345
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:03,292
No, Howard. There's
only one way forward.

346
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:07,471
Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall.

347
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,990
Sorry to keep you
waiting. This'll do nicely.

348
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,892
Please extend my thanks to the
Committee for their flexibility.

349
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:18,777
Good morning. I'm Robert
Alley for the State Bar.

350
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,507
In the matter of James M. McGill,

351
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:23,116
the State Bar intends to
prove the following violations

352
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:25,128
of the Ethical Code.

353
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,734
16-102...

354
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:30,923
engaging in conduct a
lawyer knows is criminal.

355
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,843
Mr. McGill certainly knew that
breaking down his brother's door

356
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,228
was criminal behavior.

357
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:39,019
16-804...

358
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,323
committing a criminal act
that reflects adversely

359
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:45,933
on the lawyer's honesty or
trustworthiness as a lawyer.

360
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,706
Any reasonable person would agree

361
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:50,242
that assaulting another
lawyer in his own home

362
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:54,246
reflects badly on Mr. McGill's
fitness as an attorney.

363
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,519
16-304...

364
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,119
unlawfully altering, destroying,

365
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,256
or concealing material having
potential evidentiary value.

366
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,448
Mr. McGill broke into his brother's home

367
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,327
and destroyed an audiocassette

368
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,509
which contained a
recording of a conversation

369
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,023
between himself and his
brother, Charles McGill.

370
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,837
We will show that this
recording was evidence

371
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:18,314
in an ongoing legal case.

372
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,262
The State Bar believes that,

373
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:22,308
once we have presented the facts,

374
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,044
the Committee will agree
that disbarment is warranted

375
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:27,427
for James McGill.

376
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,809
Thank you very much.

377
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:32,040
Thank you, Mr. Alley.

378
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,106
Ms. Wexler?

379
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:41,185
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

380
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:42,980
Good morning.

381
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:45,543
I'm Kim Wexler, co-counsel
with James McGill,

382
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:46,832
for the defense.

383
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,455
You've already read Mr. McGill's
Pre-Prosecution Statement.

384
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:53,439
We don't dispute he broke
into his brother's house,

385
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,833
an act he regrets...

386
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,576
deeply.

387
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:00,179
But there is another side to this story.

388
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,075
One not about calculation...

389
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:06,085
or ill intent,

390
00:19:06,086 --> 00:19:08,768
but about about two brothers,

391
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:12,599
whose relationship,
after years of strain,

392
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,601
finally broke.

393
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,264
We believe that, after you
have the complete picture,

394
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,034
you'll understand
James McGill is an asset

395
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,823
to our legal community.

396
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:27,716
And he should remain a full
member of it in good standing.

397
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:30,653
Thank you.

398
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,942
Thank you, Ms. Wexler.

399
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:40,645
Okay, if, uh, everyone's ready to...

400
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,870
begin testimony...

401
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:44,723
Mr. Alley, call your witness.

402
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,784
Bang! Bang! Bang!

403
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,227
Then he kicked down the door.

404
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,650
Jimmy was very agitated.
He was shouting.

405
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,475
He demanded Charles turn over

406
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:54,507
- the evidence he'd been collecting...
- Objection.

407
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:57,827
We haven't established the
tape is evidence of anything.

408
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,172
The defense has only acknowledged
it as a piece of property.

409
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:02,580
Uh, allow me to rephrase.

410
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:06,512
Jimmy demanded an audiocassette
in Charles' possession,

411
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:07,946
which Jimmy proceeded,

412
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:10,783
with the help of an
iron fireplace implement,

413
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:13,187
to pry from Charles' desk.

414
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,077
He then broke the cassette into pieces

415
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:17,256
and went on to confront his brother.

416
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,259
What happened after the
defendant smashed this tape?

417
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,693
Mr. Brightbill and I...

418
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:23,996
That's the private
investigator that Charles hired?

419
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:25,764
That's correct.

420
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:29,800
He and I were concerned that
Jimmy might strike his brother.

421
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:31,664
So that's when we stepped in.

422
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,505
- Thank you, Mr. Hamlin.
- Certainly.

423
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,110
Nothing further at this time.

424
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,341
Ms. Wexler?

425
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,534
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

426
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:51,883
You testified you've known
my client for some time.

427
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,518
How long exactly?

428
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,491
Nearly 10 years.

429
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:57,508
How did you come to know him?

430
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:00,466
His brother asked to hire him
in the mail-room at our firm.

431
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,784
- And you did.
- Yes.

432
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,581
What was your opinion of him then?

433
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:08,761
I thought...

434
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:11,877
he had a lot of get-up-and-go.

435
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:13,135
He was a hard worker.

436
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:15,815
You had a nickname for him, didn't you?

437
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:17,816
"Charlie Hustle."

438
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,766
"Charlie Hustle."

439
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,421
How'd you feel when you found
out he'd become a lawyer?

440
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:23,689
Surprised.

441
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,491
He'd put himself through law school

442
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,180
and taken the Bar Exam without
telling any of the partners.

443
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,328
Even Charles.

444
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,563
He bootstrapped his
way into a law degree

445
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:33,365
while working in your mail-room.

446
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:35,934
Did you consider taking
him on as an associate?

447
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:37,581
We did.

448
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:39,104
Briefly.

449
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:41,620
Sounds like you didn't
hire him. Why not?

450
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,008
With that kind of grit.

451
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:44,736
The partners decided it would be best

452
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,651
to avoid the appearance of nepotism.

453
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:51,331
We felt hiring Jimmy
might damage morale.

454
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:53,456
Nepotism.

455
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,688
Your firm is "Hamlin,
Hamlin, and McGill," right?

456
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,821
Who's the other Hamlin?

457
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:02,813
My father.

458
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:10,694
Which partner was the most
concerned with nepotism?

459
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,944
Charles McGill.

460
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:15,810
- So Jimmy's own brother blocked him.
- Objection.

461
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:19,244
How are the hiring practices of
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill relevant here?

462
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:20,879
It's relevant to understand

463
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,480
the relationship between these brothers.

464
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:27,152
We'll, uh, give you
some leeway, Ms. Wexler,

465
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:28,921
but don't stray too far.

466
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:31,290
Charles McGill is not the
subject of this hearing.

467
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,938
Thank you.

468
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:35,506
Did Jimmy know his brother was the one

469
00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:37,229
that prevented you from hiring him?

470
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,130
No. He did not.

471
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:43,068
Eventually, he was hired
by the firm of Davis & Main.

472
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:46,454
I'd be happy to say more
about that, if you'd like.

473
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,241
No. Thank you.

474
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,959
When Charles' condition appeared,

475
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,478
Jimmy took care of him, didn't he?

476
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:55,329
I believe so.

477
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:57,964
Jimmy was struggling to
build his solo law practice,

478
00:22:57,965 --> 00:23:00,402
and yet, every single day, without fail,

479
00:23:00,403 --> 00:23:03,402
he brought his brother food, supplies...

480
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:05,756
even his favorite
newspapers. Isn't that right?

481
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:07,389
He did.

482
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:11,842
Could you speak to the terms
of Charles' leave of absence?

483
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:13,489
You know I can't.

484
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,386
It was an FMLA leave.
Anything more is confidential.

485
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:19,338
But you can confirm it was
due to mental illness, correct?

486
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:22,996
Objection! Charles McGill's
mental health isn't at issue.

487
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:25,629
This is a smear job on the
State Bar's upcoming witness...

488
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,902
nothing more.

489
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:28,981
This is not a competency
hearing, Ms. Wexler.

490
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:31,418
Mr. Hamlin is not a
psychiatric professional.

491
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:33,005
Do you have any questions
that would be more germane

492
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:35,405
to his experience?

493
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:37,350
No.

494
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,700
I have nothing further.

495
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:42,240
The witness is excused.

496
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:55,297
At this time, the State Bar would like

497
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,443
to enter Exhibit Five into evidence.

498
00:23:57,444 --> 00:23:59,544
We ask that Charles
McGill's recording be played.

499
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:01,213
I'm respectfully renewing my objection.

500
00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:02,981
The probative value
of playing this Exhibit

501
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:04,650
is outweighed by how prejudicial it is.

502
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,883
All due respect to Ms. Wexler,

503
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:08,420
but the State Bar feels
this is fundamental to hear.

504
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:09,711
We don't want to leave any question

505
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:11,590
as to the intentions of both parties.

506
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:13,725
Ms. Wexler, we already
ruled this was fair game

507
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:16,094
when we denied your motion to suppress.

508
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:19,698
I'll add, the rough-and-tumble
of your client's conduct aside,

509
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:21,235
we need to know whether one lawyer

510
00:24:21,236 --> 00:24:24,111
attempted to tamper
with another's evidence.

511
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:38,045
Come here.

512
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:39,951
What are you still doing here?

513
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:42,454
- Flight's delayed.
- How delayed?

514
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:44,289
40 minutes, last I checked.

515
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,958
Shit. Okay. Keep me posted.

516
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:51,078
Um, yes.

517
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,851
Here we go.

518
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,935
Thank you for your patience.

519
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:58,603
The State Bar is ready to proceed.

520
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:00,026
Um, begging your pardon.

521
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:04,714
Um, the defense requests a
moment to review, if we could?

522
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:07,379
All right.

523
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,081
When you're ready.

524
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:11,160
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

525
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:19,624
What are we doing?

526
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,496
We're stalling.

527
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:24,892
Yes. Yes.

528
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:28,150
My brother has many admirable qualities.

529
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:32,660
I-In some ways, I can say I admire him.

530
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:34,849
Too cold.

531
00:25:35,924 --> 00:25:38,246
I love my brother.

532
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,823
But Ted Kaczynski's
brother loved him, too.

533
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,915
And he wanted to help.

534
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:46,852
That's sanctimonious.

535
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:49,187
I love my brother.

536
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:52,894
He's a good person. He has good in him.

537
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:56,871
But the law is too important.

538
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:01,732
Ah.

539
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,964
Be right there, Howard!

540
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:14,244
The law is too important.

541
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,714
Hmm...

542
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:19,460
I sure shit wouldn't
be tellin' ya otherwise.

543
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,438
But, yes...

544
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:23,462
it's the truth.

545
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,892
You'd go to such
lengths to humiliate me?

546
00:26:26,893 --> 00:26:29,350
I did it for Kim!

547
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:32,476
She worked her butt
off to get Mesa Verde

548
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:36,609
while you and Howard sat around
sipping scotch and chortling.

549
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,742
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill...
more like Scrooge and Marley!

550
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:41,930
Kim deserves Mesa Verde...

551
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:44,176
not you, not HHM.

552
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:46,645
She earned it, and she needs it!

553
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,547
I did it to help her,

554
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:52,050
but I-I honestly didn't think
it would hurt you so bad.

555
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:54,753
I thought you'd just say,
"Oh, crap, I made a mistake,"

556
00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:57,222
and go on with your life,
like a normal person!

557
00:26:57,223 --> 00:26:58,390
But, oh, no!

558
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:00,824
Wishful thinking!

559
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,363
So, can I, uh, tell Howard

560
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:08,929
you're not quitting or
retiring or whatever?

561
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:14,238
And can we take all this
shit down off the walls?

562
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:18,431
I'm gonna go call Howard.

563
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:20,332
Jimmy.

564
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:24,497
You do realize you just
confessed to a felony?

565
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:26,518
I guess.

566
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,918
But you feel better, right?

567
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,902
Besides, it's your word against mine.

568
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,290
Uh. Um.

569
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:46,137
All right, uh, Mr. Alley, uh,

570
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:49,126
we need to make accommodations
for your next witness.

571
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,956
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Mr. Chairman.

572
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:52,072
All right.

573
00:27:52,073 --> 00:27:55,280
For those who don't know,
we need to prepare the room.

574
00:27:55,281 --> 00:27:58,383
Uh, the Clerk is going to
collect your, uh, cellphones,

575
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:00,919
watches, key fobs...
anything electrical.

576
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,173
If you prefer not to,
please secure your items...

577
00:28:04,174 --> 00:28:05,657
- Thank you.
- Outside this room.

578
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:07,592
Thank you for understanding.

579
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:08,827
Your phone, sir?

580
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:11,121
I left it in the car.

581
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:01,513
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

582
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:03,346
- That's yours.
- Thanks.

583
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:17,910
Please raise your right hand.

584
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:20,856
Do you swear or affirm to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

585
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:22,447
and nothing but the truth?

586
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:24,081
I do.

587
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:30,025
Could you state your name?

588
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:31,996
Charles L. McGill.

589
00:29:31,997 --> 00:29:36,118
I'm a senior partner at the law
firm of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.

590
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,976
Can the court reporter hear me?

591
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,901
Yes, sir. I can hear you fine.

592
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:41,872
Mr. McGill, I'll try to be brief.

593
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:43,653
We don't need to dwell on the burglary

594
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:45,412
or the assault that you suffered.

595
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:46,970
Thank you. I appreciate that.

596
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:49,254
What I would like to
hear about is this tape.

597
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:51,012
What compelled you to make it?

598
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:54,081
I had a suspicion my brother
had tampered with documents

599
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:55,753
in a case I was working on.

600
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,075
And why would he do that?

601
00:29:57,076 --> 00:29:59,266
Doesn't sound particularly brotherly.

602
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,841
I believe it was his hope
that the tainted documents

603
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,428
would cause the client
to become disillusioned

604
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,230
with my representation

605
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:08,169
and return to their previous attorney,

606
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,331
Ms. Wexler.

607
00:30:09,332 --> 00:30:12,503
Which, I should note, is
precisely what happened.

608
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:13,848
Objection.

609
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:16,411
I'm not saying Ms. Wexler
knew what Jimmy was doing

610
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:17,978
or had any involvement.

611
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:20,560
I'm only stating that it happened.

612
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:23,552
Did you have any evidence to
support your suspicions about James?

613
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:25,950
No. My brother,

614
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:28,614
whatever else can be said
of him, can be quite clever.

615
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:30,955
Did an excellent job
of covering his tracks.

616
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:34,302
Objection. The witness has admitted
there's no corroborating evidence

617
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:36,341
this supposed crime even occurred.

618
00:30:36,342 --> 00:30:39,154
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

619
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,432
We're going to continue.

620
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:45,498
Uh, we'll extend you the same
latitude on cross, Ms. Wexler.

621
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:47,825
Go on, Mr. McGill.

622
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:49,192
Without physical evidence,

623
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:51,278
I felt that a recorded confession...

624
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,778
if I could get one... was my best bet.

625
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:56,261
On its own, I knew the tape
would be somewhat flimsy,

626
00:30:56,262 --> 00:30:57,563
but it was a start.

627
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,856
A foundation for a more ironclad case.

628
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:03,350
I suppose that Jimmy must have felt

629
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:05,393
the tape was decisive
evidence on its own.

630
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:07,384
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
broken in to destroy it.

631
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:09,248
Objection. More speculation.

632
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:11,140
How can he know what was
going on in Jimmy's head?

633
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:14,272
Sustained. We just need to
hear what happened, Mr. McGill.

634
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,515
I-I apologize.

635
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:19,482
I recorded my brother to
build a case against him.

636
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:20,695
And at the time,

637
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,921
would you say that you were in
possession of your faculties?

638
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,423
All due respect, but...

639
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,047
but you do sound somewhat
unhinged on the recording.

640
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:28,460
Yes, I understand that.

641
00:31:28,461 --> 00:31:30,796
But what you heard was theater.

642
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:32,931
A performance, play-acting.

643
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,319
I exaggerated the symptoms of my disease

644
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,898
to extract the truth.

645
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:40,105
Can we talk about your
disease for a moment?

646
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,577
I'd like everybody here to
be on the same page about it.

647
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:43,642
Of course.

648
00:31:43,643 --> 00:31:46,111
It is sometimes referred to as EHS,

649
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,447
electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

650
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:52,317
I describe it as an acute
allergy to electromagnetism.

651
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:54,851
It's not a common condition, is it?

652
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:57,222
I know it sounds strange. I do.

653
00:31:57,223 --> 00:32:00,227
But 30 years ago, no one had
heard of peanut allergies.

654
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:02,294
But you admit that no one...

655
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,883
uh, no doctor... has ever diagnosed you.

656
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:08,844
AIDS was not identified
properly until 1981.

657
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:11,937
HIV wasn't known as the cause until '83.

658
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:15,307
These things take time to
unravel, even for doctors.

659
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,729
Would you say that your illness

660
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,777
affects your ability to think clearly?

661
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:20,746
No. It affects me physically.

662
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:24,272
It causes me great pain.
However, I'm perfectly lucid.

663
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:25,584
Thank you.

664
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:29,386
Mr. McGill, I have only
one more question for you.

665
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,954
Do you hate your brother?

666
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,259
Absolutely not.

667
00:32:36,578 --> 00:32:38,764
I love my brother.

668
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:41,827
There's nothing malicious in Jimmy.

669
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:44,881
He has a way of doing the worst things

670
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:48,005
for reasons that sound almost noble.

671
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,287
But what I know for sure is that the law

672
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:54,028
is too important to be toyed with.

673
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:56,520
It's mankind's greatest
achievement... the Rule of Law,

674
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:58,183
the idea that, no matter who you are,

675
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,818
your actions have consequences.

676
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:04,421
And the way my brother treats the law...

677
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:07,359
it breaks my heart.

678
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,069
That's why I did what
I did. Not to hurt him,

679
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,981
but to protect something
that I hold sacred.

680
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:14,833
Thank you, Mr. McGill.

681
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:17,134
The State Bar rests.

682
00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:23,079
I think we need to put on the brakes.

683
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,827
I'm sorry. My co-counsel and
I need a moment to confer.

684
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,150
Please be brief, Counselor.

685
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:34,218
Yes, of course.

686
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,739
She'll be here.

687
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,264
Do you have anything for cross?

688
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:43,570
Uh, can I look at your notes?

689
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:44,936
Yeah, of course.

690
00:33:44,937 --> 00:33:46,198
Can we, um...

691
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,399
Yeah.

692
00:33:58,277 --> 00:33:59,578
- Hey.
- Hey.

693
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,478
So glad you made it.

694
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:06,518
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry.

695
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,288
Um, might I have a moment,
uh, to get a breath?

696
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,391
Oh, of course, Mr. McGill.

697
00:34:12,392 --> 00:34:15,293
Uh, folks, let's call this 15.

698
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:19,830
Everybody, please be back
and ready to go on the hour.

699
00:34:27,213 --> 00:34:29,908
- Rebecca.
- Chuck.

700
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,109
It's good to see you.

701
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,112
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised.

702
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,904
Did Jimmy subpoena you?

703
00:34:35,905 --> 00:34:38,626
You're not on the witness
list. You don't have to testify.

704
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:40,719
No, no, no, no. I'm not here for that.

705
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,055
Well, what, then?

706
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:45,972
Chuck, I wish you'd told me.

707
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:49,394
I-I can't believe what
you've been going through.

708
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:51,063
How long has it been?

709
00:34:51,064 --> 00:34:52,469
Ah.

710
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,166
You're here to help.

711
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,867
Because all this is so stressful for me.

712
00:34:57,603 --> 00:34:59,219
Is that what Jimmy told you?

713
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,605
He's worried about you, Chuck.

714
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:02,908
In spite of everything that's
happened between the two of you,

715
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:03,975
he... he cares.

716
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,177
What exactly did he say?

717
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:07,579
Um, well, that you had been sick.

718
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,402
Allergic to electricity?

719
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:11,349
He sent me pictures of the house.

720
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,975
Chuck, my God.

721
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:16,254
Why didn't you tell me?

722
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:18,323
I didn't want to upset you.

723
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,724
Worry you unnecessarily.

724
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:24,029
But now you're here.

725
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,196
And now you know.

726
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:30,693
I came because I thought
it was the right thing.

727
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:33,505
I thought... I don't know...
that you'd want me to.

728
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,131
But I guess that I'm
more of a distraction.

729
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:38,510
So, uh...

730
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,545
I'm gonna be in town for a few days,

731
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:43,849
and I would love to
spend some time with you.

732
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,832
But right now, I-I think I should go.

733
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,853
No. No, no, please. I want you to stay.

734
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,788
Really? You don't seem happy to see me.

735
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,356
I am.

736
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,334
Just surprised, that's all.

737
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:56,728
Please, stay.

738
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:57,945
Are you sure?

739
00:35:57,946 --> 00:35:59,664
Yes, I'm sure.

740
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:02,833
You've been sold a
bill of goods, Rebecca.

741
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,610
I want you to see what's what.

742
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,860
She's not what I expected.

743
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,085
Oh, yeah? What'd you expect?

744
00:36:20,086 --> 00:36:22,305
I don't know. Just...

745
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:24,398
not her.

746
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:31,164
You know, she's gonna
hate you when this is over.

747
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:33,946
Yep.

748
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:45,713
All right, uh, Mr. McGill,

749
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:47,565
I'll remind you you're still under oath.

750
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:48,883
I understand.

751
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:51,546
At this time, I'd like to
turn cross-examination over

752
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:54,114
to my co-counsel, James McGill.

753
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,619
Uh, well, there's been
a lot of fuss about it,

754
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,755
but you and I have never really
talked about this tape you made.

755
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,257
We lost the opportunity

756
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,894
when you burglarized
my house to destroy it.

757
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,190
Fair enough.

758
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,062
Um, and I was in the wrong there.

759
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:16,399
But, still, I'd like to
try and follow your story

760
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,944
of why and how you recorded it.

761
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,237
Oh, is this where you
claim the tape is spurious?

762
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:23,006
That it's not really your voice?

763
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,696
No. That's me on the tape.

764
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,242
But, still, I have some
questions. Like, the recorder,

765
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:32,071
it must've hurt like hell
for you to touch that.

766
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,584
There was a degree of
discomfort, that's true.

767
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,952
And where did you hide it?

768
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,587
I mean, the sound's pretty clear,

769
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,728
so it wasn't in the
couch cushions, was it?

770
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:42,292
Tucked under a space
blanket. Out of sight.

771
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,626
Wow.

772
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,361
So there's no chance I would see it.

773
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:46,663
Not with the state your place was in.

774
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,598
- Isn't that right?
- I suppose.

775
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,394
Would you like to set the scene
for the Disciplinary Committee?

776
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,353
Tell them, you know, what
your house looked like

777
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,804
at the time of the recording.

778
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,273
Objection. Relevance?

779
00:37:57,274 --> 00:38:00,810
Well, the circumstances of the
recording are materially relevant.

780
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,545
How can you know what
the tape really means

781
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,981
unless you know what was
going on when it was recorded?

782
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,520
Overruled. The witness
can answer the question.

783
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:11,788
I covered most of the walls
with Foil-Scrim-Kraft insulation.

784
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,194
I also hung a number of space blankets.

785
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:17,465
Compact Mylar sheets.

786
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:18,728
They insulate and protect

787
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:22,131
against mild electromagnetic radiation.

788
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:26,004
All right, so, shiny
insulation and space blankets

789
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:27,871
all over the walls and the ceiling.

790
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,406
It was like being
inside of a disco ball.

791
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,733
Do you have a point?

792
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:35,712
Well, um, I'm impressed

793
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,214
by how much work went
into entrapping me.

794
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,315
You went all out.

795
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:41,048
I didn't entrap you.

796
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:43,820
I provoked an admission
in adverse interest.

797
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,954
That's not the same thing.

798
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:50,059
How did you know it would work?

799
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,494
What do you mean?

800
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,487
How did you know your
"provocation" would work?

801
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:57,100
Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic

802
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,643
would make me say anything?

803
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:03,320
Isn't it because you knew
that it was precisely the thing

804
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:04,707
that would worry me so much

805
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:06,910
that I'd say anything to talk you down?

806
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:10,039
- Objection.
- Okay. Withdrawn.

807
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,749
Let's... let's get back to your house,

808
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,859
every surface covered in tinfoil.

809
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,843
Nothing crazy about that, huh?

810
00:39:17,844 --> 00:39:19,384
As I've said,

811
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:22,792
I was playing up my condition.

812
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,627
Usually, it's a perfectly normal house.

813
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,195
You think your house is normal?

814
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:29,576
Can I call your
attention to Exhibit Nine?

815
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,471
This is your house, right?

816
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:36,806
Yes.

817
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,670
So, exposed wires.

818
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,780
There's a camp stove.

819
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:47,050
There's a lantern on top of newspapers.

820
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,318
You call this normal?

821
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,720
I call them adaptations.

822
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,157
A prophylactic measure for a
physical, medical condition.

823
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,427
Did the doctor who granted
me guardianship for you

824
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:59,067
- think this was a physical condition?
- Objection.

825
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:01,347
You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.

826
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:03,138
Besides which, the
panel has already ruled

827
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:05,797
that Mr. McGill's mental
health is not at issue.

828
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:08,471
No, the State Bar opened
the door to this on direct

829
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,608
when the witness talked about
his supposed "play-acting."

830
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,677
Allowing me to follow up
on cross is only reasonable.

831
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,312
We discussed the physical allergy,

832
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,413
not a mental disability.

833
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:18,615
Potato, po-tah-to.

834
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,493
It comes down to this...

835
00:40:20,494 --> 00:40:22,952
In order to understand
what I was thinking,

836
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,370
you need to see Chuck through my eyes.

837
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:29,258
You need to know if I believed
that tape was evidence.

838
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:31,572
And I say it was evidence
of only one thing...

839
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:34,263
My brother hates me.

840
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:38,334
Now, he claims that he lied to
me to get me to tell the truth.

841
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,769
And I'm telling you

842
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,538
I lied to my brother
to make him feel better.

843
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,162
Which of us you believe

844
00:40:44,163 --> 00:40:48,531
depends on how we all understand
the mind of Charles McGill.

845
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:54,201
Well, we did promise
the defense some leeway.

846
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,692
You may proceed.

847
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:58,898
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
- But watch yourself.

848
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:07,730
Chuck, I'd like to go
back a little further,

849
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,166
talk about when these
symptoms first started.

850
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:14,385
It was shortly after you
were divorced, is that right?

851
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,306
Yes.

852
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:19,909
You think the stress of the
divorce brought on the illness?

853
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,351
I doubt it. It was an amicable split.

854
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:24,681
My ex-wife and I are
still on good terms.

855
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,184
In fact, your ex-wife is present
with us today, is she not?

856
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,919
When was the last time
you two saw each other?

857
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,187
Objection. This is not family court.

858
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:34,703
We're not here to re-litigate
the witness' divorce.

859
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:36,392
I can't see what purpose this serves.

860
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,094
I can.

861
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,504
I'll tell you why my brother
brought my ex-wife to this hearing.

862
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:43,926
4,000 miles she came,

863
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:47,020
lured by concern for me.

864
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:49,988
What Jimmy's driving at
is the last time I saw her,

865
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,708
I covered up my illness.

866
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,210
I'd been suffering
from it for some time,

867
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:57,946
but I went to great lengths
to conceal that fact from her.

868
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,332
I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.

869
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,645
I didn't want you to think less of me.

870
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,760
Now Jimmy has outed me in front of you.

871
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,629
You know why?

872
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,377
To rattle me.

873
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:17,658
He knows I still have a...

874
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:21,404
a lot of, feeling for my ex-wife.

875
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,273
He's hoping this will break me down.

876
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:25,644
Split me apart at the seams,

877
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:29,575
like a murderer confessing on
an episode of "Perry Mason."

878
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:34,149
Well, I'm sorry to
disappoint you, Jimmy.

879
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:39,998
Have I answered your
questions to your satisfaction?

880
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,727
Do you have anything else?

881
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,126
Yeah, I do.

882
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:48,598
Earlier, you talked
about other diseases.

883
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,492
Physical conditions, you said.

884
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:53,636
Uh, so, okay, if you'd
had, um... I don't know...

885
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:58,157
lung cancer, would you
have told Rebecca then?

886
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,445
If that had been the
case, maybe. I might have.

887
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,948
- So how is this different?
- Mr. McGill. Move it along.

888
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:07,243
You don't have to answer that.

889
00:43:07,244 --> 00:43:08,657
I want to get down to brass tacks.

890
00:43:08,658 --> 00:43:11,087
I want to be very, very specific here.

891
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,686
This illness, what does it feel like?

892
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:15,424
You mentioned it's painful.

893
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:16,625
It is.

894
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,868
There's a tightness in my chest,

895
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:20,530
difficulty breathing,

896
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,432
and pain, burning pain.

897
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:25,601
The pain spreads everywhere.

898
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:27,922
Sounds horrible. Does it hurt right now?

899
00:43:27,923 --> 00:43:31,046
There's always some discomfort, yes.

900
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:33,812
Electricity is everywhere
in the modern world.

901
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,047
But I very much appreciate
the indulgence of the panel

902
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,102
for their accommodation here today.

903
00:43:40,103 --> 00:43:42,603
I can handle this fine.

904
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:48,515
Right, so, with the lights
out, you don't feel them?

905
00:43:48,516 --> 00:43:50,343
If the current's not flowing, no.

906
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:52,295
Oh. Sorry about the exit signs.

907
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,382
I guess they couldn't
kill those for you.

908
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,898
Well, they're not drawing much
current, and they're far away.

909
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,002
Intensity drops off with distance,

910
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:01,571
per the inverse-square law.

911
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,872
Okay, whoa!

912
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,336
Inverse-square... I'm not a physicist.

913
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:06,742
Could you dumb that down a shade for me?

914
00:44:06,743 --> 00:44:08,118
The farther away it is,

915
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:10,980
the stronger the source
needs to be to have an effect.

916
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,327
Got it. Got it.

917
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:15,251
So, if I had a small battery,
say, from a watch or something,

918
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,040
and I got it close to you,
close to your skin, you'd know?

919
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,655
I would feel it, yes.

920
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:20,735
Can you feel more current

921
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:23,350
coming from any particular
direction right now?

922
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:24,894
Uh, from that back wall

923
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,430
or, uh, from over there

924
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,065
or up through the floor?

925
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,534
Can you tell us where
the nearest source is

926
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,434
right now?

927
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,122
Jimmy, do you have
something in your pocket?

928
00:44:41,464 --> 00:44:44,895
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

929
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:49,377
My cellphone.

930
00:44:49,378 --> 00:44:53,189
From this distance, you should
feel it, and you don't, do you?

931
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,193
Mr. McGill, you were warned to
leave your electronics outside.

932
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,928
It's all right.

933
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,927
It's all right.

934
00:45:01,244 --> 00:45:03,153
May I?

935
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,052
Ah.

936
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,161
Just as I thought.

937
00:45:10,162 --> 00:45:11,874
There's no battery in here.

938
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,075
You removed the battery.

939
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,481
That's a sorry little trick, isn't it?

940
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,627
Yeah, you got me, Chuck. Dead to rights.

941
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:23,886
I removed the battery.

942
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,055
- Objection.
- Sustained.

943
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,124
Y-You've taken all the leeway
you're getting, Mr. McGill.

944
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,182
Wrap it up fast.

945
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:32,278
God, Jimmy.

946
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:34,830
Don't you know by now this is real?

947
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,098
I feel this.

948
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:38,401
It's a physical response to stimuli.

949
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,966
It's not a quirk.

950
00:45:42,294 --> 00:45:45,206
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

951
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,266
I don't know, Chuck.

952
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:49,262
Could you reach into your breast pocket

953
00:45:49,263 --> 00:45:51,713
and tell me what's there?

954
00:45:52,745 --> 00:45:54,591
What now?

955
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:03,724
Can you tell the court what that was?

956
00:46:05,495 --> 00:46:07,330
- A battery.
- Mr. Chairman, please.

957
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,965
Do you recognize that man in back?

958
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,667
His name is Huell Babineaux.
He's on our witness list.

959
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,379
You bumped into him in the stairway.

960
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,639
He'll testify he planted this
fully charged battery on you

961
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,274
over an hour and a half ago.

962
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,709
Hour and 43 minutes ago.

963
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,835
An hour and 43 minutes.
Thank you, Mr. Babineaux.

964
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:24,635
And you felt nothing.

965
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:25,681
No, no, no.

966
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,909
- No, no. It's a trick. It has to...
- Enough is enough.

967
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,187
I submit that Mr. McGill's
mental illness is a non-issue.

968
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,424
- If he were schizophrenic...
- Schizo...

969
00:46:32,425 --> 00:46:33,706
it wouldn't take
away from the fact...

970
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,814
- that the defendant...
- I am not crazy!

971
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,662
I am not crazy.

972
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:44,000
I know he swapped those numbers.

973
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,302
I knew it was 1216.

974
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,703
One after Magna Carta.

975
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,454
As if I could ever make such a mistake.

976
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:51,140
Never. Never!

977
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,712
I just... I just couldn't prove it.

978
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:55,251
H-H-He covered his tracks.

979
00:46:55,252 --> 00:46:57,923
He got that idiot at the
copy shop to lie for him.

980
00:46:57,924 --> 00:46:59,759
Mr. McGill, please. You
don't have to go in...

981
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,032
You think this is something?

982
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:03,986
You think this is bad,
this... this chicanery?

983
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,722
He's done worse. That billboard!

984
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:09,759
Are you telling me that a man
just happens to fall like that?

985
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,712
No. He orchestrated it!

986
00:47:11,713 --> 00:47:13,486
Jimmy!

987
00:47:13,883 --> 00:47:17,289
He defecated through a sunroof!

988
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,259
And I saved him, and I shouldn't have.

989
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,633
I took him into my own firm.

990
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:24,874
What was I thinking?!

991
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,776
He'll never change.

992
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,177
He'll never change.

993
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,746
Ever since he was 9, always the same.

994
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:33,549
Couldn't keep his hands
out of the cash drawer.

995
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,251
But not our Jimmy.

996
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,686
Couldn't be precious Jimmy!

997
00:47:37,687 --> 00:47:39,923
Stealing them blind.

998
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:42,091
And he gets to be a lawyer?!

999
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,260
What a sick joke!

1000
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,096
I should have stopped
him when I had the chance!

1001
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,898
And you... you have to stop him!

1002
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,798
You...

1003
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,735
I apologize.

1004
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,469
I lost my train of thought.

1005
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:24,779
I got carried away.

1006
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:32,062
Do you have anything else?

1007
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,536
No.

1008
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,669
Nothing further.

1009
