小姑娘 那就是π的小数点后一千位
And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,860
我本来能说 真不该问你
I'd say I'm sorry I asked,

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,130
可是我没问
except I didn't.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,570
哦 你看 这期科学美国人
Oh, look, it's the Scientific American

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,380
报道了Leonard和我写的那篇论文
that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,350
哦 让我看看
Oh, let me see.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,980
我对接受采访的态度很复杂
I have mixed feelings about doing interviews.

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,150
我喜欢自己说话
I like the part where I talk.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,830
但是我不喜欢听别人说话
I do not like the part where the other man talks.

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,100
Sheldon 这篇文章一点都没有提到Leonard
Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,870
这不可能吧
Well, that can't be right.

14
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,940
它上面只写了"Cooper博士和他的团队"
It only refers to "Dr. Cooper and his team."

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,840
你谈到过他吗?
Did you even talk about him?

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,420
我只是回答了几个关于这个理论的问题
All I did was answer a few questions about the theory.

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,580
我还感谢了科学美国人
And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,050
没有寄来那些臭臭的香水卡片
doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards.

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,690
Leonard真可怜
Poor Leonard.

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,020
为什么? 他想出来的理论
Why? The theory he came up with

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,690
被科学美国人报道了
just got mentioned in Scientific American.

22
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,050
他应该很兴奋啊
He ought to be thrilled.

23
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,490
他也许不会
He might not be.

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,530
哦 也许你说的对
Oh, maybe you're right.

25
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,860
他是有点笨笨的
He is kind of a lump.

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,000
你自己想想看
Think about it.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,930
如果他们说你是Leonard的团队里的一员
How would you feel if you were referred to

28
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,640
你会怎么想?
as part of Leonard's team?

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,900
哦 我会非常生气的
Oh, I'd be incensed.

30
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,410
那你明白我想说什么了吗?
So you see what I'm getting at?

31
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,980
吱吱叫的轮子有油加?
Squeaky wheel gets the grease?

32
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,380
不是
No.

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,290
这山望着那山高?
Grass is always greener?

34
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,990
再试试
Try again.

35
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,650
啊 我不知道... 我们都是树精格鲁特?
Well, I don't know... we're all Groot?

36
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,760
告诉我吧
Just tell me.

37
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,830
Leonard和你对这份论文的贡献一样大
Leonard is as much a part of this paper

38
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,900
而他被忽视了
as you are, and he was overlooked.

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,860
他会很难过的
He's going to feel bad.

40
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,140
但这不是我的错啊
But it wasn't my fault.

41
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,670
我又没有把他排除出去
I didn't exclude him.

42
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,270
这篇文章也不是我写的
And I didn't write the article.

43
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,340
你还记得你在迪士尼乐园那次 他们没有选你
Remember that time you didn't get picked to pull the sword out

44
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,570
去拔石中剑 而是挑了另外一个小孩吗?
of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?

45
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,780
哦 那小屁孩!
Oh, that kid!

46
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,030
Leonard真可怜
Poor Leonard.

47
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,830
是啊
Exactly.

48
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,260
我得说一句 选那小孩太不明智了
For the record, that kid was a terrible choice.

49
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,030
如果你的油条掉到地上了你就要哭
If you cry when you drop your churro,

50
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,610
那你完全没有统治英格兰的能耐
you do not have what it takes to rule England.

所爱之人的遗物 是什么样的感受
having to go through a loved one's possessions.

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,480
我的叔叔崇拜的是奎师那

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,080
但他去世以后 你知道我们发现什么了吗?

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,280
一个湿婆的塑像
A statue of Shiva.

68
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,290
虽然不是什么血雨腥风的帮派对头
It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay?

69
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,550
但在印度 这也算是个事
But in India, it's a thing.

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,880
呃 你在就好
Well, it'll be good that you're there.

71
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,160

73
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,550
啊 这是很难
Well, it's hard.

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,790
妈妈的很多东西都会勾起一些快乐的回忆
A lot of Ma's stuff brings back fond memories.

75
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,220
所以你才不愿意丢掉
Is that why you couldn't get rid of

76
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,030
她那个装满番茄酱的抽屉吗?
her drawer full of ketchup packets?

77
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,190
是啊 这让我记起来 我们在外面吃饭的时候 她对我说
Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying,

78
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,230
"快 没人看着 多拿点番茄酱放你口袋里"
"Quick, nobody's looking, fill your pockets with ketchup"

79
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,520
Leonard啊?
Leonard?

80
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,630
你有没有注意过
Have you ever noticed that

是的
Yeah.

83
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,570
好的 好的
Good, good.

84
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,470
电费单上只有你的名字
And your name is on the electric bill

85
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,370
而没有我的 
and mine isn't.

而且我对这件事没什么意见
And I'm okay with that.

87
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,140
其实 电费单上写的是你的名字
Actually, your name is on the electric bill.

88
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,080
哦 对哦
Oh, right.

89
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,980
真是个灾难
This is a disaster.

90
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,410
我完全不知道你在讲什么 我还同意你的说法
I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.

91
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,120
好吧 有件事我要告诉你
Okay, I have to tell you something,

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,130
但你会不高兴的
but you're not going to like it.

93
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,530
怎么了?
What's going on?

94
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,990
科学美国人上发表了一篇
An article was just published

95
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,000
关于我们理论的文章
in Scientific American about our theory.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
他们很讨厌它吗?
Did they hate it?

97
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,670
不 不 他们爱死它了
No. No, they loved it.

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,270
他们 呃 说了一大堆好话
They, uh, couldn't say enough nice things about it.

99
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,840
那有什么问题吗?
So what's the problem?

100
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,310
你知道我们的省钱一族...
You know how the Penny Saver only has my name...

101
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,580
Sheldon啊!
Sheldon!

102
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,250
那篇文章里他们没有提到你
They didn't mention you in the article.

103
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,650
只提到了我
Only me.

104
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,460
真的?
Really?

105
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,580
是啊
I know.

106
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,790
这不公平
It's not fair.

107
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,700
放下你的怒火 兄弟
Let the anger go, buddy.

108
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,130
你...
You just...

109
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,840
放松所有的肌肉
you relax all your muscles.

110
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,570
除了你的耻尾肌和肛管括约肌
Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter.

111
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,140
那两个要收紧了
Let's keep those tight.

112
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,410
呃 不... 你不需要这样的
Uh, that... that's not necessary.

113
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,010
其实需要... 他们是帮你憋尿憋屎用的
It is... they're what hold back the urine and the feces.

114
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,950
听着 也许... 也许你不该读
Look, maybe... maybe you shouldn't read it.

115
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,880
你只会感觉更糟糕
It'll only make you feel worse.

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,420
"Cooper和他的团队"?
"Cooper and his team"?

117
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,890
你要知道这件事和我完全没关系
You should know I had nothing to do with that.

118
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,960
呃...
Uh...

119
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,630
至少他们在讨论这个理论
at least they're talking about the theory.

120
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,860
我是说 这个最重要
I mean, that's what's important.

121
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,330
你说的对
You know, you're right.

122
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,400
是啊 就像斯坦·李和史蒂夫·迪特科
Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko

123
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,170
一起创作了蜘蛛侠
created Spider-Man.

124
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,010
功劳全被斯坦·李占了
Stan Lee may get all the credit,

125
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,980
但是史蒂夫·迪特科知道他也一样重要
but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important.

126
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,880
虽然斯坦·李可以在所有的漫威电影里出镜
Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies.

127
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,520
而且... 而且他还很有钱
And... and he's far richer.

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,710
而且他是个家喻户晓的人了 对吧?
And he's a household name, you know?

129
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,020
但是 你说迪斯科
Whereas, you know, you say Ditko,

130
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,690
听上去感觉是个公司的名字
and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.

131
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,990
你这是帮倒忙
That's not helping.

132
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,360
好吧 我能再多举几个例子的
Well, I'd give more examples,

133
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,830
但是像你这样被遗落的人 实在太难想起来还有谁了
but, well, everyone in your position's so forgettable.

134
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,600
Stuart 我们来了
Stuart, we're here.

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,470
你让他继续住在你妈妈的屋子真好
It's nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom's house.

136
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,070
是啊 我本来想把他丢到路边去的
Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb,

137
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,940
但是没有人愿意收留他
but nobody took him.

138
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,540
嘿
Hey.

139
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,540
跟你说一下 这里停电了
Just so you know, the power's out.

140
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,740
怎么了?
What happened?

141
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,050
我打电话问了 他们说一个变压器爆炸了
I called, they said a transformer blew.

142
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,120
整个街区都停电了
It's the whole block.

143
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,350
应该明天就修好了
Should be fixed by tomorrow.

144
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,180
等等 什么时候停电的?
Wait, when did it go out?

145
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,650
半夜的时候
In the middle of the night.

146
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,360
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

147
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,730
Howie 怎么了?
Howie, what's wrong?

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,230
全都解冻了
It's all defrosting.

149
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,900
没事的 只是食物而已
It's okay. It's just food.

150
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,680
这不只是食物
It's not just food.

151
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,740
这是我妈做的唯一剩下的食物
This is the last food my mother ever made.

152
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,080
这是她仅剩的牛胸肉
This is her last brisket.

153
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,750
这是她仅剩的烘肉卷
This is her last meatloaf.

154
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,210
这是她仅剩的...
This is her last...

155
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,820
我看不出这是什么 但是...
I have no idea what this is, but...

156
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,690
这是仅剩的了
it's the last one.

157
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,290
一切还好吗?
Everything okay?

158
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,490
不好
No.

159
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,490
老妈做的所有食物都要变质了
All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.

160
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,900
我们为什么不拿回家 放进咱们的冰箱里?
Well, why don't we take it home and put it in our freezer?

161
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,530
你不会想这么做的
You don't want to do that.

162
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,500
再冰冻不仅会使它脱水
Refreezing not only removes moisture,

163
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,800
更会在肉纤维表面形成冰晶
but it creates ice crystals in the fibers of the meat

164
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,700
进而影响口感和质地
that can compromise its taste and texture.

165
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
怎么了? 我看到说教的机会
What? I saw a teachable moment.

166
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,870
就显摆了些烹饪学问
I dropped some culinary science.

167
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,740
我们该怎么办呢?
What should we do?

168
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,080
我来告诉你该怎么办
I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do.

169
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,920
把它吃了
We're gonna eat it.

170
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,820
这里差不不多有二十磅的食物
There's, like, 20 pounds of food in there.

171
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,920
你只说过
All you said

172
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,490
我要处理掉它们
was I had to get rid of things.

173
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,490
又没说不能让它们先通过我的肠道
You didn't say they couldn't pass through my colon first.

174
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,760
哎Howie...
Howie...

175
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,400
好吧
Okay.

176
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,870
那这样吧?
Then how about this?

177
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,040
我们请大家过来吃晚饭
Let's invite everyone over to dinner.

178
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,050
就当是老妈做的最后一顿饭
It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.

179
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,950
我喜欢这主意
I love that.

180
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,580
我也是
Me, too.

181
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,580
快看 我们有足够的番茄酱
Oh, look, we've got enough ketchup

182
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,920
来蘸满所有食物
to cover every ounce of it.

183
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,060
我说 到底有谁读"科学美国人"杂志?
I mean, who even reads Scientific American?

184
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,930
这其实挺重要的
It's kind of a big deal.

185
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,330
如果真有这么重要 为什么封面明星
If it's such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity

186
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,060
最大牌的就是一个分子了?
they could get for the cover is a molecule?

187
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,800
我们可以别谈这个了吗?
Can we please just stop talking about it?

188
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,670
对不起 我能做什么呢?
I'm sorry. What can I do?

189
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,840
什么也不用 我没事
Nothing, I'm fine.

190
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,140
不不 我要让你振作起来
No, no. I'm gonna cheer you up.

191
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,780
要开始了
Here we go.

192
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,050
打算做什么呢?
What are we doing?

193
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,850
- 我要带你购物  - 哦
- I am taking you shopping.  - Oh.

194
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,520
我的宝贝不开心 我要哄他高兴
My baby is sad, and I'm gonna make him happy again.

195
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,380
听着 我知道购物让你高兴
Look, I know shopping cheers you up,

196
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,390
但我真不喜欢这个
but it's just not really my thing.

197
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,060
那这架由iPad控制的
Well, what about this helicopter

198
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,730
直升机如何呢?
you control with an iPad?

199
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,630
配备摄像头吗?
Does it have a camera in it?

200
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,830
它有配备摄像头哟
It does have a camera in it.

201
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,790
宝贝在听
Baby's listening.

202
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
喂Leonard?
Leonard?

203
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,290
喂Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard? Leonard?

204
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,400
怎么了?
What?

205
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,670
我跟杂志的记者谈过了
I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.

206
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,870
情况怎样? 有说这是我的主意了吗?
What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?

207
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,900
我说了
I did.

208
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,140
谢谢你 他怎么说?
Thank you. What did he say?

209
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,470
他说杂志编撰要求文章
He said they made the editorial decision

210
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,010
只引用首席科学家
to only cite the lead scientist.

211
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,320
他怎么会以为你是首席科学家?
Why did he think you're the lead scientist?

212
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,710
这可是我的主意!
It was my idea!

213
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,050
要知道 多付四块钱的话
You know, for an extra four bucks,

214
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,190
这东西明天就能寄到
I can have this thing here tomorrow.

215
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,750
我知道这是你的主意
Well, I know it was your idea,

216
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,220
但那个记者说他关注我的研究很久了
but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while,

217
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,520
他们在杂志里引用我们的论文
and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine

218
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,490
只因为里面有我的名字
is 'cause my name is on it.

219
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,730
你知道吗? 我付了 四块钱算什么?
You know what? I did it. What's four bucks?

220
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,660
如果你是在让我好受点
If you're trying to make me feel better,

221
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,130
这么做没用
it's not working.

222
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,870
那... 要是我告诉你
Well... then what if I told you

223
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,170
我把你名字加进了有线电视账单呢?
that I added your name to the cable bill?

224
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,270
- 没用  - 哦
- No.  - Oh.

225
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,280
这样也好 他们让我候机了
That's just as well. They had me on hold

226
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,910
整整20分钟 然后我就挂了 我...
for 20 minutes and I hung up. I...

227
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,720
喂Leonard? Leonard?
Leonard? Leonard?

228
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,520
喂Leonard?
Leonard?

229
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,290
还有 Wolowitz请大家去吃晚饭 所以...
Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so...

230
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,030
你准备好了就叫上我
I'm ready whenever you are.

231
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,850
他有的只是个主意
All he had was an idea.

232
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,590
可那是很重要的一部分
Well, that is an important part.

233
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,850
拜托!
Oh, please!

234
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,790
我整天满脑子的主意
I have ideas all day long.

235
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,630
颠覆海洋世界 让海豚玩耍人
Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people.

236
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,390
在中号和大号间加个新尺码 叫"杏号"
A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge.

237
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,130
以矮人"喷嚏精"的视角重讲"白雪公主"的故事
Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy.

238
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,200
为什么"万事通"不给他开点药?
Why won't Doc prescribe him something?

239
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,670
这下能知道了
We finally find out.

240
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,700
但Leonard主意很棒
But Leonard's idea was good.

241
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,100
行 那就"爱生气"... 他对什么那么生气?
Fine. Then Grumpy... what's he so grumpy about?

242
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,840
或许是因为他女朋友不挺他
Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.

243
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,940
主意是我想到的!
I'm the one who thought of it!

244
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,010
他不也做了许多研究吗?
Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?

245
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,150
但他让人们将错就错得以为
But now he's happy to let people think

246
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,880
一切都是他的杰作
he's responsible for everything.

247
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,120
所以补偿你一架iPad操控的直升机啊!
And that's why you get an iPad helicopter!

248
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,120
比他更享有盛誉 是我的错吗?
Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?

249
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,320
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

250
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,230
按字母排 论文上我名字靠前
Is it my fault that my name came first

251
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,890
是我的错吗?
on the paper alphabetically?

252
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,100
不是你的错
Not your fault.

253
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,930
记者引用我为首席科学家
Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me

254
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,030
而我没有指正 是我的错吗?
as the lead scientist I didn't correct him?

255
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,800
嘿 看那只可爱的小鸟
Hey, look at that pretty bird.

256
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,070
他总想成为焦点
He always needs all the attention.

257
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,230
真像个婴儿
He's such a baby.

258
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,800
我知道 我知道
I know, I know.

259
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,400
我发誓 他休想玩我的直升机
I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.

260
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,240
好的 我先热一些食物
Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up.

261
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,510
谢谢
Thanks.

262
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,010
天啊
Oh, man.

263
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,880
这是我高中毕业舞会上戴的胸花...
This is the boutonniere from my high school prom...

264
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,610
我成人礼时留的一片蛋糕
a piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.

265
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,150
她有丢掉什么吗?
Did she throw anything away?

266
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,310
没有
No.

267
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,720
要是找到我的包皮 我就自杀
If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself.

268
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,820
好了 这里有 呃
Okay, so we've got, um,

269
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,720
三块牛胸肉 四个烘肉卷 一份千层饼
three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna...

270
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,520

No, that's Noodle Kugel.

271
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,650
一份犹太千层饼...
One Jewish lasagna...

272
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,720
两个磅饼 每个约重八磅
two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each,

273
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,860
还有一大罐素球汤
and one giant container of Matzah ball soup.

274
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,220
老妈一直备在手头
Ma always kept it on hand,

275
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,020
就怕我生病
in case I got sick.

276
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,830
她觉得她的料理包治百病
She thought she could cure anything with her cooking.

277
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,930
甚至是那次我食物中毒
Even the time I got food poisoning.

278
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,770
吃她的料理吃的
From her cooking.

279
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,440
你还好吧?
You okay?

280
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,450
嗯 我很好
Yeah, I'm okay.

281
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,980
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

282
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,640
好的
You got it.

283
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,620
我永远跟她说不上话了
I'm never gonna talk to her again.

284
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,580
要别让大家过来吗?
Should we tell everyone not to come?

285
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,680
不 我想这么做
No. I want to do this.

286
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,750
好吧 你能撑住的话 我也会坚持的
Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can.

287
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,010
好的
Okay.

288
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,450

I'm not making any promises!

哇哦 这里看起来真漂亮
Wow, it looks really pretty in here.

292
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,230
是啊 原来用上半打烛台真能营造氛围
Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.

293
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,560
呃 Stuart 要是Howard卖了这栋房子
So, Stuart, have you thought about

294
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,440
你有想过怎么办吗?
what you'd do if Howard sells the house?

295
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,570
现在氛围没了
And there goes the mood.

296
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,630
嗨 哈喽
Hi. Hello.

297
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,570
噢 我得说向Leonard说一个特别的你好
Oh, and a special hello to Leonard,

298
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,300
他必须被提到名字
who needs to be mentioned by name.

299
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,940
真不做作
Subtle.

300
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,440
你还是被提到了 对吗?
But you got it, right?

301
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,240
嗨 各位
Hey, guys.

302
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,670
嗨 哈喽
Hey. Hi. Hello.

303
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,940
我只是想告诉大家

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,900
你错了哦
That's not true.

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,500
我们这里有番茄

这么些聪明人围坐在一张充满烛光的桌子旁
All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight.

321
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,570
仿佛我们在办18世纪的法国沙龙一样
Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.

322
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,010
一点不错
Indeed.

323
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,120
Penny 沙龙就是
Penny, a salon is a gathering

324
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,250
文化人聚集起来 谈一天的趣事
where intellectuals entertained each other

325
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,620
用闪耀着智慧光芒的谈话相互娱乐 
with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.

326
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,960
噢 那就像"视野"一样
Oh, so it's like "The View".

327
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,800
Sheldon "视野"是一个由女人主持的日播脱口秀

Penny 下一代指的是星际迷航...
Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek...

332
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,110
闭嘴
Shut up.

333
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,090
我想来提议一个沙龙话题
I would like to propose a salon topic.

334
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,520

Ooh, please do, Rajesh.

335
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,730
在"饥饿游戏"里 队长是一个女人
The lead in "The Hunger Games" is a woman.

336
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,070
漫威让一个女人来当"Tor"
Marvel has made "Tor" a female.

337
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,840
等等 谁是"Tor"?
Wait, who's Tor?

338
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,010
就是 索 雷神啊(其实是索尔)
You know, Tor, the God of "Tunder".

339
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,680
如我所说 这是不是表明了
As I was saying, is this a sign

340
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,950
我们的社会正在走向两性平等呢?
that our society is approaching gender equality?

341
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,460
现在确实有很多女人在看漫画书了啊
Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.

342
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,550
是的
It's true.

343
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,630
我店里的厕所马桶都得装座垫了
At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.

344
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,060
除非女索尔生个孩子
We won't know if there's equality

345
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,900
复仇者也不在意工作的时候她在一旁挤奶
until female Thor has a baby

346
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,330
否则我们也不知道是不是平等
and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.

347
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,170
我就想知道那个孩子是不是
I wonder if only a baby who is worthy

348
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,170
也得有本事才能吃女索尔的奶(雷神之锤梗)
can suckle at the bosom of Thor.

349
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,210
好吧 新的话题
Okay, new salon topic.

350
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,040
沙龙... 是很久前就有的蠢东西
Salons... dumb thing from a long time ago

351
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,280
还是本来有趣却因谈超级英雄而变得很蠢?
or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes?

352
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,450
讨论吧
Discuss.

353
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,220
我不觉得话题有什么重要的
I don't believe it matters what the topic is.

354
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,450
沙龙里最重要的是
What's crucial for a salon

355
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,950
我们用一种高端和充满洞察力的方式
is that we conduct the discussion

356
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,350
进行讨论
in an elevated and insightful way.

357
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,260
重要的是执行
It's all about the execution.

358
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,920
当然重要的是执行而不是灵感
Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration.

359
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,490
呃 新话题
Uh, new salon topic.

360
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,560
灵感与执行 哪个更重要?
What's more important, an idea or its execution?

361
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,060
噢 这个好玩
Oh, that's fun.

362
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,700
对啊 这话题对你多合适 Leonard
Yeah, good for you, Leonard.

363
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,300
这真是一个可爱的小概念
That's a lovely little notion.

364
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,500
就好像是
Kind of like,

365
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,030
"要是能和我芝加哥的叔叔通电话就好了"
"I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago."

366
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,140
对啊 靠边站 哥发明了电话
Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone.

367
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,130
"哈喽? 呃 等等"
"Hello? Oh, hold on."

368
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,330
Leonard 是你叔叔
Leonard, it's your uncle.

369
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,740
他说你刚刚被讽刺傻了
He says you just got burned.

370
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,880
Sheldon啊
Sheldon.

371
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,350
- 你们啊  - 不 没事
- You guys.  - No, it's okay.

372
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,710
我们都是成年人 正在进行一场智慧的讨论
We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion.

373
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,850
起码我是
At least I am.

374
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,220
Howard 你怎么看
Howard, what do you think?

375
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,950
好吧 我想作为一个工程师 我倾向于执行
Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution.

376
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,020
我每天都
I spend my days

377
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,290
努力的去
trying to take

378
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,990
把想法变成现实
ideas and make them real.

379
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,260
说得好 伙计
Well said, old chap.

380
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,960
我以为演说家都死完了 结果今天我们这儿又出来一个
I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us.

381
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,940
从今天开始 就是"葛底斯堡的演说"
Starting today, it'll go: "Gettysburg Address,

382
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,740
"我有一个梦想" 还有你刚才说的
"I have a dream" and what you just said.

383
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,080
噢 现在他是个天才了?
Oh, now he's a genius?

384
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,580
以前你只取笑他和工程学而已
All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.

385
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,670
拜托 Leonard 他母亲刚刚去世
Leonard, please. His mother just died.

386
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,580
你太荒唐了
You're being ridiculous.

387
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,710
对 你也是
Yeah, so are you.

388
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,340
各位 如果你想听人哔哔的话
Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy,

389
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,650
我就去我真正的剪头沙龙了
I'd go to my real salon.

390
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,450
Leonard 很多人可能有过这一想法
Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea,

391
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,720
但很少有人可以
but very few people could've

392
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,490
像我一样把数学公式理清
worked out the math the way I did.

393
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,920
但是很多人没有这想法
Lots of people also didn't have that idea,

394
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,900
这世界上所有人都没有 除了我
like everyone in the entire world except for me.

395
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,770
噢 好吧 很显然Leonard认为
Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks

396
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,700
他比全世界所有人都厉害
he's better than everyone in the whole world,

397
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,810
也包括那些
including those

398
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,140
为我们自由而战的人
fighting for our freedom.

399
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,610
好吧 我不了解你
Yeah, well, I don't know about you,

400
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,380
但我支持我们派驻海外的战士
but I support our boys overseas.

401
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,420
还有女战士
And girls.

402
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,250
嘿 你已经毁了索尔 歇一会吧
Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.

403
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,760
所以我应该赞同你
So I'm just supposed to be okay

404
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,830
独占所有的荣誉是吗?!
with you hogging all the credit?!

405
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,630
我什么都没占
I didn't hog anything.

406
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,020
不像你 还有带葡萄干的的奇怪烤面条
Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.

407
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,260
你想要这个?
You want some of this?

408
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,730
- 我给你来点  - 嘿! 
- I'll give you some.  - Hey!

409
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,660
Sheldon Leonard 给我出去 现在!
Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!

410
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,340
她先说了我的名字 你一定受不了吧
She said my name first, that must kill you.

411
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,510
我不知道你们想干什么
I don't know what you think you're doing,

412
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,870
但这是一个对我丈夫而言很重要的时刻
but this is a very difficult time for my husband!

413
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,670
我们正在吃他妈妈留下的最后食物
We're eating the last food his mother ever made,

414
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,140
你们竟然像孩子一样把它们互相乱扔?!
and you were gonna throw it at each other like children?!

415
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,380
我不管你们在吵什么 先放一边
Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside,

416
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,590
回去做个Howard的好朋友
go back in there and be a good friend to Howard

417
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,450
否则你们就都别想吃甜点了!
or there's no dessert for either of you!

418
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,960
跟你讲话的时候看着我!
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

419
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,400
不要以为... 
And don't think...

420
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,700
你们有没有注意到 有时Bernadette说话像我妈妈一样?
You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?

421
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,810
- 没听见  - 一点儿不像
- I don't hear it.  - No, not at all.

422
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,520
我觉得我这辈子都没吃过这么多东西
I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life.

423
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,780
怪不得我祖先在沙漠里走了40年
It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years.

424
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,520
走了这么久才消了食
Took that long to walk it off.

425
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,250
你看 Penny 以色列人在沙漠里...
You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert...

426
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,660
闭嘴!
Shut up!

427
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,690
太好了你们终于吵完了
So glad you two are done fighting.

428
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,300
现在 我只是努力的不在打嗝时吐出来
Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up.

429
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,340
"今日物理"提到那篇论文了
"Physics Today" mentioned the paper.

430
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,430
他们说什么
What'd they say?

431
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,830
管那个干什么? 他们提到Leonard?
Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?

432
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,930
他们提到了
They did.

433
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,560
太好了
Yay.

434
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,010
好消息 我找到了更多的咀嚼片
Good news, I found more Tums.
