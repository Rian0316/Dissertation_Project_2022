00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,920
那它不会被我喜悦的泪水弄坏了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So it's safe from my tears of joy.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,050
怎么了  我让你丢人了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's wrong? Am... am I embarrassing you?

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,920

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- At least take the flowers. - No!

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,230
如果你连个小礼物都不收
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you won't accept this simple gift,

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,300
那我们的未来还有什么指望呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}then what does that say about our future?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,400
我们没有未来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We have no future.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,310
不过我今晚很需要有人陪我给我打气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I could really use some cheering up.

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,280
我本来是有对象的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was... seeing someone.

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,010
但是她最近跟我分手了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But, uh, she recently broke up with me.

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,520
爱情总是要冒风险的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Love is always a risk.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,810
爱的机会不是每天都有的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The chance for love doesn't come around every day.

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,190

20
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,830
我们就得找到介绍她的方式
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we gotta have some way to introduce her.

21
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,750
为什么不说她是我们的家人呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, why don't we just say she's family?

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,070
我喜欢这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I love that.

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,310
洁德  出什么事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jade, what's going on?

24
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,790
-杜克要杀了茶缸  茶缸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Duke is gonna kill Teacup. - Teacup?

25
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,800
是我们的狗  他说如果我不去见他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Our dog. He says if I don't meet with him,

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,210
他就要杀死它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he's gonna put her down.

27
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,390
过去两年里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For the last two years,

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,310
我一直都是那个连剧本都写不完的可悲伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've been pathetic Eli who... who can't finish a screenplay,

29

账单也付不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}who can't help pay the bills.

30
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,120
我只需要一场胜利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just need a fucking win.

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,430
我只想让自己感觉像个爷们儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just want to feel like a man

32
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,060
把狗救下来  做得足够好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and save a dog and have that be good enough.

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,420
洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jade!

34
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,420
艾普尔人很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}April is very sweet.

35

她非常自由随性
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's so free-spirited.

36
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,890
你不知道我们在一起有多开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You wouldn't believe the fun we have together.

37

尝一块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Try one.

39
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,870
好像没什么感觉啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't think it's working.

40
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,270
你看起来像喝醉了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're acting like you're drunk.

41
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,000
那可能是因为飞叶子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That might be the pot.

42
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,120
-飞叶子  -就是大麻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Pot? - It's marijuana.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Actually, I just remembered,

104
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,160
我莉狄娅姑妈周二要做手术
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}my aunt Lydia is getting an operation Tuesday.

105
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,710
-手术  -为了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- An operation? - Mm, to...

106
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,570
治疗她的拇滑液囊肿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}fix her bunion.

107
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,830
我答应了要把她从医院接回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I agreed to bring her home from the hospital

108
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,690
然后照顾她一整晚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and look after her. All night.

109
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,350
你能找别人去照顾她吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, can you get someone else to look after her?

110
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,670
你不能错过我的表演
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't miss my show.

111
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,890
我已经答应她了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I already promised.

112
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,560
是个很大的拇滑液囊肿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And it's... such a big bunion.

113
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,080
是跟罗伯有关吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is about Rob, isn't it?

114
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,540
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

115
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,280
承认吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just admit it.

116
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,020
你不想见他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't want to meet him

117
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,080
因为你不看好我和罗伯的关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because you don't approve of Rob and I's relationship.

118
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,280
相信我  不是因为这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Believe me, that is not the reason.

119
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,050
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}整夜营业

120
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,480
就跟你说吧  我们迷路了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm telling you, we're lost.

121
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,310
如果你在我们下高速的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, maybe if you'd asked for directions

122
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,780
记得问个路的话...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}when we got off the highway...

123
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,050
如果你能选个近一点的汽车旅馆的话...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe if you'd picked a motel closer than 30 miles away...

124
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,710
我猜我们应该从这左转吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I think we go left here?

125
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,580
我们是在兜圈子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, we're going in circles.

126
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,840
这是我们第三次路过那个醉汉了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is the third time we've passed that wino.

127
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,300
太昏暗了我都看不清路标
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it's too dark to read the signs.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,810
停下  我去问问那家酒水店
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, stop and I'll ask at the liquor store.

129
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,370
我们在派克街
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We're on Pike Street.

130
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,790
给我看下地图
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Show me the map.

132
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,590
开走吧  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Move along, kid.

133
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,480
抱歉  我们正准备离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry, we were just leaving.

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,010
站住  可人儿  你被抓了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not you, sweet cheeks. You're busted.

135
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,570
-被抓了  为什么  -卖淫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Busted? For what? - Soliciting.

136
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,600
你觉得我是个妓女吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think I'm a hooker?

137
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,700
拜托  我穿的可是YSL
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For God's sake, I'm wearing Yves Saint Laurent.

138
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,150
我可没说你不算成功
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't say you weren't successful.

139
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,940
她是和我一起的  先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, she's with me, sir.

140
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,090
她只是去问个路
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She was just asking directions

141
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,960
因为我们迷路了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because we got lost.

142
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,280
放松  孩子  我是在帮你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Relax, kid. I'm doing you a favor.

143
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,060
你不会想要把初夜献给一位老手的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't want your first time to be with a pro.

144
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,310
你胆敢信口雌黄
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How dare you?

145
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,010
我可是有名的慈善家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm a well-known philanthropist.

146
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,450
我不需要知道你的专长
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't need to know your specialty.

147
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,680
-跟我走  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Let's go. - What?

148
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,520
赶紧的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on.

149
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,880
慢着  先生  她真的是我女朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey! Seriously, sir, she's my girlfriend.

150
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,010
我不相信
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I find that hard to believe.

151
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,720
给他看你的驾照
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, show him your license.

152
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,850
如果我们是刚见面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If we just met,

153
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,310
我怎么会知道他叫汤米·哈特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how do I know his name is Tommy Harte

154
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,590
住在帕萨迪纳市
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and that he lives in Pasadena

155
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,690
奥克赫斯特大道74号
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}at 74 Oakhurst Drive?

156
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,340
他的生日是3月10号
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His birthday is March 10.

157
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,850
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

158
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,230
如果你们是帕萨迪纳来的情侣
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, if you're a couple from Pasadena,

159
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,140
为什么要去阿苏萨的汽车旅馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}why are you going to a motel in Azusa?

160
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,300
我们这是婚外情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We are having an illicit affair.

161
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,140
我们开了30多英里是为了避免被
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We've driven 30 miles to avoid being spotted

162
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,820
他妈妈  也就是我最好的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}by his mother, who is my best friend,

163
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,680
以及我的同性恋丈夫撞见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and my husband, who is gay.

164
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,350
不得不说  你们还挺有创意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I got to give you points for creativity.

165
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,540
玩得开心  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Have fun, kid.

166
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,150
伊莱  你能不能帮我遛下茶缸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli! Hey, can you walk Teacup for me?

167
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,840
我在帮泰勒打包行李
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm helping Taylor pack for her trip.

168
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,590
-好的没问题  -谢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah, sure. - Thanks.

169
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,070
还是要去弗雷斯诺  是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Still going to Fresno, huh?

170
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,440
我必须去  这个会议数月前都已经定好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have to. This conference has been on the books for months.

171
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,680
亲爱的  你公司的人知道我们被袭击了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey, the people at your firm know that we were attacked.

172
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,970
如果你取消的话  他们一定会理解的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, they wouldn't blink if you opted out.

173
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,740
我懂  但是我已经告诉了我的姐妹们我要回去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know, but I told my sisters I'm coming to town,

174
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,620
她们仍旧威胁说这个夏天要来看我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and they're still threatening to visit this summer,

175
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,720
所以我们应该在她们来之前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so we kind of want to break the news

176
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,920
先挑明我们目前的居住情况
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}about our living situation before that happens.

177
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,980
你为何不发个信息给她们呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why don't you just shoot them a text?

178
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,060
我才不要短信告知我姐妹我处在一段三人关系中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not gonna tell my sisters I'm in a throuple via text.

179
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,320
确保你告诉她们这是你的主意  而非我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Just make sure you tell them it was your idea, not mine.

180
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,880
-但这确实是你的主意  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- But it was your idea. - Yeah,

181
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,470
但是你的姐姐们已经够恨我的了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but your sisters hate me enough as it is.

182
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,790
我们就没必要再火上浇油了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We don't need to throw any more gas on that fire.

183
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,010
你还没见过她们  但是她们糟透了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You haven't met them yet, but they're awful.

184
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,860
好的  茶缸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, Teacup.

185
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,090
我们走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Whoa, here we go.

186
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,530
-拉马尔  -原来你还记得我是谁啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Lamar. - Oh! You do know who I am.

187
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,910
我正纳闷呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was curious

188
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,690
因为你已经躲我好几周了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'cause you've been avoiding me for weeks.

189
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,240
没有没有  我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no, no, no. I...

190
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,840
我正准备打给你呢  哥们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I was absolutely gonna call you back, man.

191
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,470
我只是...最近太忙了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just... I've been incredibly busy.

192
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,520
忙到有空养狗啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I see you had time to get a dog.

193
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,860
对了  忘记告诉你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, forgot to tell you.

194
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,970
你会喜欢这个消息的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll like this.

195
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,790
我终于试了下三P
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Finally had that threesome.

196
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,970
我很想问这和养狗有什么关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I would ask what one has to do with the other,

197
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,000
不过还是他妈的算了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but never the fuck mind.

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,440
-我的剧本呢  -剧本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Where is my script? - Script?

199
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,580
你许诺我一个月前就该写好了的那个剧本呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The one you promised would be done a month ago?

200
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,210
我和派拉蒙影业谈好了的那个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The one I talked up to Paramount.

201
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,150
他们当时都很兴奋  如今都气炸了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Got 'em all excited, and now they're pissed off

202
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,630
不知道剧本是什么情况
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}wondering what happened to it.

203
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,900
就快...快要写好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it-it's almost done.

204
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,410
我只是...在做最后的细微改动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm just... making a few final tweaks.

205
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,550
得了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, please.

206
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,430
比这更陈词滥调的怕是只剩"要有光"了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The only line older than that is "Let there be light."

207
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,460
不  我没撒谎  听着  我向你保证...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I'm not lying. Look, I-I swear to you...

208
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,560
我向你保证  一周内我会把剧本交给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I swear to you, I will have it to you in one week.

209
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,000
不行  你只有24个小时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. You got 24 hours.

210
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,560
计时开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Starting now.

211
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,110
别这样啊  哥们  我们本该是朋友的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on, man, we're supposed to be friends.

212
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,560
听着  我是你的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, I am your friend.

213
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,970
换做是其他经纪人早就抛弃你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Any other agent would have kicked your ass to the curb long ago.

214
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,040
好吧  没错  当然了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, well, yeah, and of course,

215
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,210
我很感激有你挺我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm grateful that you stood by me,

216
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,720
但是拜托了...宽限到这周五
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but please, I mean... Give me till Friday.

217
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,670
最后期限是明早10点15分
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You got till 10:15 tomorrow.

218
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,170
快点改吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tweak fast.

219
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,280
你是在搞婚外情吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you having an affair?

220
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,530
真的吗  卡尔  早餐前说这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Really, Karl, before breakfast?

221
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,720
不  我今早听到你讲电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I heard you on the phone this morning.

222
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,360
你在和某人争执
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You were arguing with someone,

223
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,970
除非这人找到一个隐蔽的地点  不然你拒绝见面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}refusing to meet unless they found a discreet location.

224
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,340
你竟敢偷听私人谈话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You listened to a private conversation?

225
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,850
-你应该感到惭愧  -我确实很惭愧...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You should be ashamed of yourself. - Well, I am...

226
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,270
在小巷子里和一个餐厅勤杂工做完爱之后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}after I've had sex with a busboy in an alleyway,

227
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,030
但是偷听我心安理得
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I-I don't really break a sweat over eavesdropping.

228
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,110
无论如何  我不欠你什么解释
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Regardless, I don't owe you any explanations,

229
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,480
-所以换个话题吧  -得了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- so drop the subject. - Oh, go on.

230
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,830
告诉我这人是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell me who it is.

231
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,230
是我们乡村俱乐部的朋友吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is it one of our friends from the country club?

232
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,040
网球教...不对  是那个厨子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The tennis instruct... No, the chef.

233
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,970
卡尔  我看你是嫉妒了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl, I believe you're jealous.

234
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,110
别傻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, don't be daft.

235
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,230
对了  如果他是一名叫朱利欧的餐厅勤杂工
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, by the way, if it is a busboy named Julio,

236
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,760
你能否替我向他问个好呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}will you give him my regards?

237
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,340
这讽刺可真是太美味了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mm, the irony is just delicious.

238
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,150
是我们的某位邻居吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is it one of our neighbors?

239
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,490
随便你怎么猜  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dig all you like, Karl.

240
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,480
就算我有婚外情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Even if I were having an affair,

241
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,820
你绝不会从我这里听到他的名字的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you'd never hear his name from me.

242
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
我们得谈谈汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We need to talk about Tommy.

243
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,300
坏消息是他最近一直鬼鬼祟祟的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The bed news is he's been acting strangely.

244
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,690
他整晚整晚的不在家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He leaves the house at all hours of the night.

245
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,800
回家后也不告诉我他去了哪里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Won't tell me where he's been when he comes home.

246
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,020
我希望汤米没有误入歧途
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I do hope Tommy hasn't fallen in with the wrong crowd.

247
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,160
你为什么看着我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why are you looking at me?

248
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,660
-我在递给你曲奇  -这样啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'm offering you a cookie. - Oh.

249
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,200
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Right.

250
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,220
好消息是我给他找了份新工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The good news is I got him a new job

251
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,140
贝德尔的苗圃公司
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}working for Bader's Nursery.

252
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,770
他将去做入户照料
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He'll be doing home care.

253
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,370
-入户照料  -也就是说他会去到别人家里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Home care? - That means he'll go into people's houses

254
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,250
在他们外出工作或者度假时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and water their plants while they're at work

255
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,770
给植物浇浇水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}or on vacation.

256
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will he?

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,660
这就是我来拜托你们的原因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is where the favor comes in.

258
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,290
我要请我所有的朋友都雇佣汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm asking all of my friends to hire Tommy.

259
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,340
我得让他忙起来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to keep him busy.

260
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,930
先让我搞清楚  大家不在的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just so I'm clear, people leave town

261
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,810
把家门钥匙给汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and give Tommy the keys to their homes?

262
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,020
我知道你在想什么  但是汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know what you're thinking, but Tommy is

263
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,420
很值得信赖  他动作也很快
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}very trustworthy... and quick, too.

264
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,590
他会快进快出的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He'd be in and out.

265
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,620
我相信他一定会待到把工作"做完"才离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sure he'd stay long enough to get the job done.

266
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,500
那是当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course.

267
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,640
我能把你们家算进去吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can I count you in?

268
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,450
何乐而不为呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, why not?

269
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,150
我们都很喜欢汤米  不是吗  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We like Tommy, don't we, darling?

270
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,370
没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes.

271
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,980
我们当然喜欢他了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We certainly do.

272
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,590
可怜的艾普尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Poor April.

273
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,230
如果你能看到她那副面庞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you could have seen her face.

274
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,030
你不会想要让我接近淫妇那张脸的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you don't want me anywhere near that tramp's face

275
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,790
因为我会扇死她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because I will slap it.

276
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,700
今晚对她很重要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's her big night.

277
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,910
她很想让我去  我深感荣幸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was honored she wanted me to come so badly.

278
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,970
她就没其他朋友了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Doesn't she have any other friends?

279
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,300
还是说她也睡了她们的丈夫们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or did she sleep with their husbands, too?

280
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,510
我很欣慰罗伯会去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm glad Rob is going.

281
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,790
她需要有人在那里鼓励她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She needs someone there to cheer her on.

282
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,080
我不明白
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't get it.

283
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,370
这是场战争
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is war.

284
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,310
你正在跟另一个女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are fighting with another woman

285
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,770
争夺你的丈夫  而你快输了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}over your husband and you are losing.

286
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,800
亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey!

287
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,710
他回来得真早  我在里面  罗伯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's home early. I'm in here, Rob.

288
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,840
如果他告诉你  他周二得加班到很晚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If he tells you that he's got to work late Tuesday,

289
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,430
我就立刻吐一地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will vomit and you will have to mop

290
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,540
你就得重新拖一遍地板
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}this floor up all over again.

291
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,100
你在这呢  你猜怎么着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There you are. Guess what?

292
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,710
我有好消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have amazing news.

293
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,700
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You do?

294
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,770
我有两张世界职棒大赛的票
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I got two tickets to the World Series.

295
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,820
什么时候的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}For when?

296
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,670
我来猜猜看  周二吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let me guess. Tuesday?

297
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,010
还真的是周二
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}As a matter of fact, yeah.

298
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,850
是我老板送给我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My boss gave them to me as a gift,

299
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,480
座位就在本垒后面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and they are right behind home plate.

300
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,560
你打算带谁去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who are you taking?

301
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,620
这还用问吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you mean, who am I taking?

302
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,970
当然是带我心爱的女孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Only my best girl.

303
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,900
让我看看票
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let me see those.

304
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,870
我操
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Holy crap!

305
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,090
他有两张世界职棒大赛的票
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's got two tickets to the World Series.

306
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,970
我刚才不是说了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Isn't that what I just said?

307
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,080
是周二的票吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And these are for Tuesday?

308
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,980
对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

309
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,280
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's wrong?

310
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,340
我就想确认一下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I just want to make sure

311
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,630
我们有没有忘了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we haven't forgotten about any plans

312
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,490
之前给周二定下的什么安排
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we might have made for Tuesday?

313
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,750
不管之前安排了什么  都通通取消
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, whatever plans we made, consider them canceled.

314
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,230
我和我的娇妻  以及道奇队和洋基队有个约会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've got a date with my wife, the Dodgers and the Yankees.

315
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,640
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

316
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,430
怎么了  你为什么不高兴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's going on here? Why aren't you happy?

317
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,900
她可高兴了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, she is very happy.

318
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,130
她只是不习惯你突然这么好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's just not used to you being so wonderful.

319
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,960
罗伯  麻烦你先出去  我们还没拖完地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob, give us a second. We're not through with the mopping.

320
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,110
我得打给卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I got to call Carl.

321
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,210
他会嫉妒得发狂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's gonna be so jealous.

322
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,830
艾普尔会心碎的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}April is going to be heartbroken.

323
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,410
谁管艾普尔死活啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}To hell with April.

324
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,080
你得着眼于大局
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got to focus on the big picture.

325
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,100
他在你和她之间选了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's choosing you over her.

326
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,590
你要赢了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're winning.

327
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,420
看来是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I guess I am.

328
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,970
泰勒打来过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey. Taylor called.

329
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,910
她到弗雷斯诺了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Her plane landed in Fresno.

330
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,640
你在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you doing?

331
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,140
自杀
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Killing myself.

332
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,590
-用芝士吗  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- With cheese? - Yeah. My plan is

333
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,680
我的计划就是吃到爆肥  然后死于高血压
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to get super fat and then die of hypertension.

334
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,710
那得花好一段时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That might take a while.

335
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,220
只有伟大的作家才有资格迅速死掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Only great writers deserve quick deaths.

336
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,030
海明威  沃尔夫  普拉斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hemingway, Wolfe, Plath.

337
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,980
而我  我是个无才的作家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Me? I'm a bad writer,

338
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,130
我只配慢慢受折磨而死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so I deserve to die slowly,

339
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,370
充满痛苦  充满厌恶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}painfully... disgustingly.

340
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,080
家里有黄芥末吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do we have any mustard?

341
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,520
没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

342
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,970
但我们有蛋黄酱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But we have mayonnaise.

343
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,580
调味品中的战斗机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yes, the condiment of hacks.

344
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,140
拿过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bring it to me.

345
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,990
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's going on?

346
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,790
如果我明早不能把剧本给他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My agent's gonna drop me

347
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,150
我的经纪人就要炒了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if I don't get him my script by tomorrow morning.

348
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,590
你还没写完吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you're not finished?

349
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,890
我已经写了50页了  但是很糟糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I've written 50 pages. Each just worst than the last.

350
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,840
别这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I doubt that.

351
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,310
我是说我还没写第三幕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, I have no third act.

352
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,640
我就坐在这
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I keep sitting here,

353
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,220
盯着我那唯一大火电影的海报
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}staring at the poster of my one and only hit,

354
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,150
{\an8}{\fs18\fsp2\fn方正兰亭黑简体\b1\bord0\blur0\shad0\fad(0,0)}《昨日珍妮》

355
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,200
祈祷有灵感到来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}praying for some sort of inspiration.

356
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,300
看得越久我越明白
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And the longer I look at it, the more I realize...

357
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,250
那只是昙花一现
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}it was a fluke.

358
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,050
我是说  出色的导演  一流的演员
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, brilliant director, stellar cast,

359
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,290
把我写的废话变成金子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}all turning my crap dialogue into gold.

360
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,180
我该怎么告诉泰勒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How am I gonna tell Taylor

361
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,970
我失去了我的经纪人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that I lost my fucking agent?

362
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,760
把那50页给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give me the 50 pages.

363
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,770
干嘛  你要用来打我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why, so you can beat me with them?

364
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,230
我觉得我能给你一些真诚的建议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because I think it might help you to get some honest feedback.

365
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,890
你懂写作吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you know anything about writing?

366
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,170
我知道我喜欢什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know what I like.

367
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,800
如果我觉得你的剧本写得不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And if I think that your script's in decent shape,

368
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,690
你就有信心把它写完了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you'll have the confidence to finish the damn thing.

369
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,830
好吧  如果这50页只是我写的屁话呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, and what if it's just 50 pages of me shitting the bed?

370
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,350
那么我就去商店给你买
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then I will go to the store and I will buy you

371
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,100
所有人类已知的奶酪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}every kind of cheese known to man.

372
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,280
还有蛋黄酱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And mayonnaise.

373
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,170
我需要吃很多蛋黄酱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Gonna need lots of mayonnaise.

374
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,430
罗伯  你在干嘛  我们要迟到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob, what are you doing? We're going to be late.

375
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,090
我在找我的旧棒球手套
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm looking for my old baseball glove.

376
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,360
也许我能让桑迪·科法斯在上面签名
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe I can get Sandy Koufax to sign it.

377
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,300
今晚别打扰科法斯先生了  他要工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't bother Mr. Koufax tonight. He'll be working.

378
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,030
签个名的时间还是有的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eh, he can sign one glove.

379
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,520
也许是在车库的某个箱子里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe it's in one of the boxes in the garage.

380
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,160
不  应该在这里面的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, it should be in this one.

381
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,540
斯坦顿家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stanton residence.

382
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,180
等等
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hold on.

383
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,760
也许你是对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe you're right about the garage.

384
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,920
去找下工具屉旁的盒子  我得接个电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Check the box by the tool drawer. I got to take this.

385
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,210
是谁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who is it?

386
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,000
一个同事  我马上下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, a guy from work. Uh, I'll be right down.

387
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,560
你他妈以为你在干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What the hell do you think you're doing?

388
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,850
我说了不能打电话到我家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I said never to call me here.

389
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,590
我已经告诉你了我和我妻子有事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I already told you, I got plans with my wife.

390
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,420
她要我带她出去吃饭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's making me take her out to dinner.

391
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,270
别哭  听着  我讨厌你哭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't cry. L-Look, I hate it when you cry.

392
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,960
这事我一点办法没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's nothing I can do about this.

393
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,740
我得挂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now-now I got to go.

394
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,010
好吧  你是对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, you were right about the garage.

395
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,210
没找到你的手套
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No sign of your glove.

396
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,770
没事  我们走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eh, it doesn't matter. Let's get going

397
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,540
不然我们会错过国歌演奏的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}or we'll miss the national anthem.

398
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,940
宝贝  我觉得我去不了了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey, I don't think I can go.

399
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,400
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

400
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,530
我感觉不舒服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not feeling well.

401
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,840
你看着没事啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You look fine to me.

402
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,030
罗伯特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Robert.

403
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,840
你记得我们在新墨西哥的旅行吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You remember our trip to New Mexico?

404
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,830
你是说  你得...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You mean, you got...

405
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,890
对  我得待在洗手间附近
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. I should stay close to a bathroom.

406
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,390
好吧  体育场里有洗手间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, they got bathrooms at the stadium.

407
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,540
在陌生人面前我做不到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I could never do that to total strangers.

408
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,260
想要我在家陪你吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Want me to stay home with you?

409
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,850
别傻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't be silly.

410
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,640
真好  谢天谢地  因为我真的很想去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, good. Thank God, 'cause I really want to go.

411
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,380
再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bye.

412
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,160
艾普尔  我是希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}April, it's Sheila.

413
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,300
我姑妈没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My aunt is fine.

414
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,490
我可以去听你唱歌了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can come hear you sing after all.

415
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,490
对  我也很开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. I'm happy, too.

416
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,030
真开心见到你们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It is so good to see you guys.

417
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,870
真希望妈妈也能来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just wish Mama could've made it.

418
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,820
她怎么样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How is she?

419
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,170
-讨厌依旧  -还是那么刻薄
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Nasty as ever. - Mean as the day is long.

420
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,760
我们为了她拼命工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We work our fingers to the bone for that woman.

421
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,480
但那永远不够
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But it's never good enough for her.

422
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,530
医生说她能活到一百岁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The doctor says she could live to be 100.

423
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,730
她会的  就是为了刁难我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And she'll do it, just to spite us.

424
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,520
好吧  听着  我知道她很难照顾
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, look, I know she can be difficult to care for,

425
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,850
我真希望我能帮上忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I wish I could help out more.

426
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,260
别担心  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, don't worry about it, sugar.

427
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,860
-我们不恨你  -反正不是特别恨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- We don't resent you. - Not much, anyway.

428
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,480
如果你能偶尔把她接到你家住的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would be nice if you could take her off our hands

429
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,280
那就再好不过了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}every now and then.

430
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,950
你那大房子里有多余的房间吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Got an extra room in that big house of yours?

431
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,320
不用太高档
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't need to be fancy.

432
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,460
地下室也行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, it could be the cellar for all we care.

433
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,490
我很愿意帮忙  但是有点棘手
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I would really like to help out, but it would be tricky,

434
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,890
考虑到我现在的居家状况
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}given my current living situation.

435
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,350
好吧  我本想一开始就和你们说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, I meant to lead with this when I sat down,

436
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,480
但是真相是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but the truth is...

437
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
我的婚姻不再开放了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am no longer in an open marriage.

438
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,990
-你离开伊莱了  -谢天谢地
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You left Eli? - Thank you, Jesus.

439
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,920
没有  我没有离开伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I didn't leave Eli,

440
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,940
我让我的炮友住进了我们家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I moved my lover into our home.

441
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,180
我们三个正式在一起了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The three of us are officially a throuple.

442
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,320
这事可以告诉妈妈吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would it be okay if we tell Mama?

443
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,910
这肯定能气死她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'Cause this will kill her.

444
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,580
希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila.

445
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,990
-你好  -看看你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hi. - Look at you.

446
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,690
-你真漂亮  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You're lovely. - Thanks.

447
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,280
我好紧张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I'm so nervous.

448
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,920
没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're going to be great.

449
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,880
孩子  再过10分钟就该你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, kid, you're on in ten.

450
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,350
谢谢你  波特先生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, thank you, Mr. Porter.

451
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,460
你在看什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you looking for?

452
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,070
说来挺傻的  罗伯说他不能来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's silly. Rob told me he can't make it.

453
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,020
我  我总觉得他也许会给我个惊喜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just... I keep thinking maybe he'll surprise me.

454
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,770
宝贝  你现在不能想这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey, you can't worry about that right now.

455
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,230
你马上就要表演了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got a show to do.

456
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,370
你说得没错  感谢你能来这里看我表演
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're right. Thank you so much for being here.

457
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,390
惊艳全场吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Knock 'em dead.

458
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,800
好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

459
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,470
*我还是小女孩的时候*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* When I was just a little girl *

460
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,700
*我问我妈妈  我会成为什么*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* I asked my mother, What will I be? *

461
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,510
*我会变得漂亮吗  我会变得有钱吗*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* Will I be pretty, will I be rich? *

462
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,420
*她这么对我说*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* Here's what she said to me *

463
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,060
*天意难违*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* Que será, será *

464
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,400
*该来的总会来*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* Whatever will be, will be *

465
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,150
*我们无法预知未来*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* The future's not ours to see *

466
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,920
*天意难违*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* Que será, será *

467
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,410
*该来的总会来*
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}* What will be, will be... *

468
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,200
怎样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well?

469
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,690
很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's good.

470
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,590
你不喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You hate it.

471
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,440
不  很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. It's good.

472
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,750
-不算出色  -部分出色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- It's not great. - Some of it's great.

473
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,490
对话  餐厅里的戏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The dialogue, the scenes in the diner...

474
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,080
直接说哪里不好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just-just skip to what sucks.

475
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,020
就是你的主人公
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That would be your lead character.

476
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,960
伊娃怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's wrong with Eva?

477
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,490
她差不多等了15页的篇幅  就希望男人来拯救她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She waits around for 15 pages hoping a man will save her.

478
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,030
她是个受害者  我讨厌受害者
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's a victim. I hate victims.

479
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,360
是啊  好吧  让她更主动一点当然可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, yeah. Okay. I mean, make her more proactive, sure.

480
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,380
她不能做点有趣的事情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And can't she do something interesting

481
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,390
让自己免除麻烦事吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to get out of trouble?

482
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,350
-什么叫有趣的事情  -比如第40页
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What do you mean, interesting? - Like, on page 40,

483
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,900
她被男人抛弃在餐厅里  心碎不已  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}she's abandoned at the diner and totally broke, right?

484
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,020
-是啊  -那你让她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah. - So, let her

485
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,570
偷走店主的卡车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}steal the owner's truck

486
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,840
然后开到毒贩子那里去放一把火
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and then she drives to the drug dealer's house and starts a fire.

487
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,090
等毒贩子从前门跑出来的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And when he runs out the front,

488
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,660
她从后门进去  把她被他夺走的钱全都拿回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}she goes in the back and gets the money that he took from her.

489
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,140
还有他的枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And his gun.

490
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,000
绝对得拿走他的枪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She'd definitely take his gun.

491
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,520
我是说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wow. Um, I mean,

492
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,810
这样绝对显得她更积极主动了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-it's definitely more proactive.

493
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,620
只是...我不知道  我没这样想过伊娃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's just... I don't know, I-I never saw Eva that way.

494
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,180
我是说  她是个好女孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, she's... she's a nice girl.

495
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,470
是啊  但好女孩也都会犯法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, but nice girls, they break the law every day.

496
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,100
只要有需要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When they need to.

497
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,090
好吧  行了  我知道你的意见了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay. All right, I hear you.

498
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,550
应该让伊娃并不像表面看上去这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's more to Eva than meets the eye.

499
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,140
没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Exactly.

500
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,610
好了  开始吧  打开电脑去工作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So now, get started, open your laptop, get to work.

501
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,100
你还有22个小时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You have 22 hours.

502
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,490
不过你怎么会想到这种设定呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How did you come up with that stuff, anyway?

503
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,710
或许我也并不像表面看起来这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe there's more to me than meets the eye.

504
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,270
嗨  抱歉我来晚了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey. Sorry I'm late.

505
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,400
没关系  你明白要做什么了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's okay. Are you clear on what to do?

506
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,560
我想是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I guess.

507
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,160
我们真的确定吗  如果被抓住的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are we sure about this? I mean, if we get caught...

508
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,130
没错  这样非常冒险
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. It's very risky.

509
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,390
我想聪明的做法是我们两个结束外遇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I suppose the smart thing to do is end this affair

510
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,950
再也不发生关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and never have sex again.

511
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,820
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fine.

512
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,390
我不知道为什么会觉得杜博纳太太的床这么舒适
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know why Mrs. Dubner's bed feels amazing.

513
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,050
因为床单好  都是埃及棉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's the sheets. They're Egyptian cotton.

514
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,320
你怎么知道的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How do you know that?

515
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,580
我在我爸洗衣店工作的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I used to wash sheets like this

516
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,180
经常洗这样的床单
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}when I worked in my father's laundry.

517
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,470
你爸爸是开洗衣店的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your dad owned a laundry?

518
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,790
你以为我一直是富人家的孩子吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think I was born rich?

519
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,750
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well... yeah.

520
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,160
才不是呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not even close.

521
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,840
我12岁的时候  非常羡慕这奢华的一切
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When I was 12, I used to covet things like this.

522
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,560
我有一次悄悄拿了有污渍的床单回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Once, I took some satin sheets home.

523
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,680
我想知道那种床单的触感
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wanted to see what it felt like

524
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,880
睡上去的感觉  哪怕只有一晚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to sleep on them, just for one night.

525
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,740
我妈妈发现了  她非常生气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My mother caught me. She was so angry.

526
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,220
她命令我立刻洗好并熨好了它们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She made me wash and iron them right there.

527
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,060
那可是凌晨2点啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was 2:00 in the morning.

528
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,010
然后她就把床单拿走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And then she took them away.

529
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,270
真可惜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's a shame.

530
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,450
我妈说  如果你想睡贵的床单
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mother said, "If you want to sleep on expensive sheets,

531
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,070
那就好好挑一挑枕边人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}choose wisely who you sleep next to."

532
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,010
所以她基本就是要你嫁给有钱人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, uh, she basically told you to marry for money.

533
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,870
这个可真不是什么好建议
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's, uh, some really bad advice.

534
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,770
我这样做了两次
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I followed it twice.

535
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,680
在遇到卡尔之前  我不觉得自己能为爱结婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't think of marrying for love until Karl.

536
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,610
我之前从没跟人讲过这事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I never told that story before.

537
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,650
给任何人听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}To anyone.

538
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,220
谢谢你先告诉了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thanks for telling me first.

539
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,070
如果你真的想谢我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If you really want to thank me,

540
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,210
就过来这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}get over here.

541
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,360
我感觉很糟糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I feel so badly about this.

542
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,900
让你费了这么大劲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}After you went to all the trouble

543
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,950
载我从机场回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}of taking me to the airport.

544
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,190
没关系  乔伊斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's fine, Joyce.

545
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,030
你生病的时候  没有人会非要强迫你搭乘飞机的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nobody expects you to get on a plane when you're feeling ill.

546
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,620
是苗圃店的车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, it's the plant van.

547
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,520
汤米肯定在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy must be here.

548
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,710
最终我跟伊莱坦白了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, finally, I confessed to Eli

549
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,920
洁德对我的重要性
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how much Jade meant to me,

550
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,220
他也同意让她一直跟我们住在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he agreed to let her live with us, permanently.

551
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,130
我知道这种方式很不传统
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, I know, it's unconventional,

552
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,360
你们可能会不赞同
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you probably don't approve,

553
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,520
但是我们相处得很融洽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but... it's working.

554
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,470
只要你们高兴就好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, as long as you're happy.

555
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,900
那才是最重要的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's what matters.

556
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,370
真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Really?

557
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,930
你们就只想说这些吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's all you have to say?

558
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,230
既然你这么问  我问一个问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Since you asked, I have a question.

559
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,960
-来了  -你还爱着伊莱吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Here we go. - Do you still love Eli?

560
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,080
-当然  -而你还爱着这个女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Of course. - And you also love this woman?

561
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,970
是的  我很好奇他们之间是什么感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. I'm wondering, how do they feel about each other?

562
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,640
这个嘛...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh. Well...

563
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,900
我就知道她还没有想过这件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I knew she hadn't thought it through.

564
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,640
-根本没想过  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hadn't even crossed her mind. - Mm-hmm.

565
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,230
等等  伊莱和洁德也喜欢彼此
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hold on. Eli and Jade like each other.

566
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,000
那不是问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's not a problem.

567
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,370
现在还不是  万一他比你更喜欢她了呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not yet. What happens when he likes her more than you?

568
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,290
等她受够了跟别人分享爱人呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What happens when she gets tired of sharing?

569
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,490
-那你怎么办  女士  -变成局外人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Where does that leave you, missy? - On the outside

570
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,440
眼睁睁看着他们在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}looking in, that's where.

571
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,560
才不会发生这种事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's not gonna happen.

572
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,330
绝对不会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not.

573
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,760
显然我们不了解洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Obviously, we don't know Jade.

574
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,820
所以没法判断她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So we can't judge her.

575
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,010
但我们了解伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But we know Eli.

576
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,910
我们亲眼见过他让你受的苦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We saw what he put you through.

577
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,480
没错  我们经历过一段阴暗时期
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, we went through a dark time,

578
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,020
但那是两年前的事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but that was two years ago.

579
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,630
"阴暗时期"  那家伙可是个瘾君子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"A dark time"? The man's a drug addict.

580
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,670
你们一半的积蓄都被他拿去买毒品了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Half your savings went up his nose.

581
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,520
那人根本没有自控能力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The man's incapable of self-control.

582
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,180
现在他床上还有另一个女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And now he's got another woman in his bed?

583
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,610
你以为会发生什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The hell did you think was gonna happen?

584
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,630
够了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop it!

585
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,930
我知道你们想激怒我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know you're trying to bait me,

586
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,400
但没用的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but it's not gonna work.

587
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,150
我告诉你们  伊莱变了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm telling you, Eli has changed.

588
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,420
天真的妹妹  男人死性不改的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, baby sister, men never change.

589
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,230
他们只是越来越会隐瞒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They just get better at keeping secrets.

590
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,900
有人吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

591
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,030
我是杜博纳太太
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's Mrs. Dubner.

592
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,180
你不是说她要去法国吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You said she was going to France.

593
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,910
是啊  我妈今早还送她去机场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, my mom took her to the airport this morning.

594
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,410
汤米  你在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy, where are you?

595
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,560
你得躲起来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You have to hide!

596
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,600
把床铺好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Make the bed.

597
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,010
我没法同时做这两件事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't do both.

598
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,720
我知道你觉得我疑病症很严重
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know you think I'm a ridiculous hypochondriac,

599
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,360
但我是真的很疼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but the pain is real.

600
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,330
你会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll be fine.

601
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,150
你只需回房躺下休息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You just need to lie down in your room.

602
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,670
杜博纳太太  你没赶上飞机吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mrs. Dubner. Did you miss your flight?

603
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,600
我偏头疼  我需要休息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm having a migraine. I need to rest.

604
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,240
不  你不能进去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, uh... you can't go in there.

605
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,500
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why not?

606
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,440
我刚刚喷了东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I, uh, just sprayed.

607
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,020
什么东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sprayed?

608
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,930
杀虫剂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, insecticide.

609
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,050
你的榕树上有只白粉虱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your, uh, your ficus had a white fly.

610
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,130
-我从没见过有什么白粉虱  -它们...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I've never seen any white fly. - Yeah, well, they're...

611
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,580
它们个头很小的  瞧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they're pretty tiny... see?

612
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,170
天呐  快弄死它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God. Kill it!

613
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,190
我不知道你这么快就回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}See, I-I didn't know that you would be back so soon,

614
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,530
所以我用了很浓的杀虫剂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so I used a very strong insecticide.

615
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,300
你偏头疼还吸入那些臭气的话...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You inhale those fumes with a migraine and...

616
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,470
你说得对  我能闻到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're right. I can smell it.

617
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,370
对  你最好待在楼下吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, y-you better stay downstairs.

618
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,240
别傻站着  来扶她下楼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't just stand there, help her down.

619
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,310
你得赶紧去一趟药房
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We need you to run to the pharmacy.

620
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,530
现在吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now?

621
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,330
我的药吃完了  这是我的处方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm out of medication. Here's my prescription.

622
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,960
我得去打开卧室的窗户
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I should go open some windows in the bedroom.

623
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,910
散散臭味儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}To air it out.

624
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,280
快点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, hurry.

625
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,870
乔伊斯很难受
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Joyce is in agony.

626
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,210
乔伊斯不舒服  我得去药房
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Joyce is sick. I have to go to the drugstore.

627
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,490
我要怎么离开这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, how am I supposed to get out of here?

628
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,700
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

629
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,390
-喂  -卡尔  是我  需要你帮个忙
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hello? - Karl, it's me. I need your help.

630
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,680
大声点  我听不清
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Speak up, I can hardly hear you.

631
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
我被困在乔伊斯·杜博纳家里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm trapped in Joyce Dubner's house.

632
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,730
老天  她是不是又叨逼她切阑尾那破事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, dear, is she telling her appendectomy story again?

633
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,770
她不知道我在这  娜奥米也不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She doesn't know I'm here, and neither does Naomi.

634
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,790
什么  娜奥米也在那里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry, Naomi's there?

635
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,070
没错  我被困在楼上了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, and I'm trapped upstairs.

636
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,050
楼上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Upstairs?

637
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,370
这是不是跟你没在发生的婚外情有关
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would this have anything to do with the affair you're not having?

638
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,960
现在不是说这个的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now is not the time!

639
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,510
你语气好恶劣哦  我要挂电话了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, what a nasty tone. I think I'm gonna hang up.

640
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,830
好吧  好吧  行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, all right, fine, fine.

641
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,870
我是在搞婚外情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm having an affair.

642
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,260
现在能不能拜托你过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now can you please come over here

643
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,620
引开她们注意  好让我溜出去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and create a distraction so I can get out?

644
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,440
这是当老公应该做的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are husbands for?

645
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,410
伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli?

646
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,640
伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, Eli.

647
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,190
醒醒  伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli, hey.

648
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,640
你睡着了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You fell asleep.

649
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,610
-天呐  几点了  -凌晨4点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, my God, what time is it? - It's 4:00 in the morning.

650
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,010
什么  惨了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What? Oh, shit.

651
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,990
-你写完多少了  -61页
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- How much have you done? - 61 pages.

652
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,510
好消息是这故事的方向对了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The good news is that I think the story's working,

653
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,060
但我说不好  我分辨不出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but, I mean, I don't know, I can't tell,

654
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,990
因为我实在太累了  无法思考
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'cause I'm just so tired I can't even think.

655
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,260
你必须继续写
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, you have to keep going.

656
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,430
-拉马尔早餐前就要收到剧本  -我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Lamar expects the script by breakfast. - I know, I know.

657
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,090
我已经连续写了10小时了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've been writing for ten hours straight.

658
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,930
相信我  我汽油里已经一滴油箱都没有了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Believe me when I tell you that there is no tank left in the gas.

659
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,710
等等  不  我没说错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wait. No, that's right.

660
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,810
等等  我有东西能帮你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hold on, I have something.

661
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,810
找到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here we go.

662
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,180
吃掉它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take this.

663
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,340
这是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What is that?

664
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,490
我开了药治疗我的注意力不集中症
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I get pills to help with my ADHD.

665
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,440
这药能帮你提神和集中注意力
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They give you a lift and they help you focus.

666
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,580
我觉得我不应该吃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't think I should.

667
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,880
没事的  这没什么大不了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's fine. It's not a big deal.

668
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,730
大学生们期中考前经常吃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Like, college kids take them all the time

669
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,320
用来临时抱佛脚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to cram for midterms and shit.

670
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,760
还是不了  谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah... No, thank you.

671
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,140
好吧  你自己决定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, it's your choice.

672
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,170
-不管了  把药给我  -你确定吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Fuck it, give me the pill. - Are you sure?

673
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,860
确定  我必须写完剧本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, yes. I need to finish the script.

674
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,330
伊莱  你怎么来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli. What are you doing here?

675
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,000
亲手把剧本交给你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hand-delivering you my script.

676
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,310
你不能用邮件发给我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You couldn't send it by e-mail?

677
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,050
不  不行  因为我需要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no, no, I could not, because I needed

678
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,010
直视你双眼  然后告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to look you in the eye when I told you

679
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,620
我没写完
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that it's not done.

680
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,830
-你不是吧  -可是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, come on... - But, but,

681
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,220
我写了八十页  而且很精彩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I finished 80 pages, and it's great.

682
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,050
精彩到你看后会打给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So great that you're gonna call me,

683
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,730
为你有动过不再雇我的念头
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you're going to apologize for ever considering

684
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,600
而向我道歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}dropping me as a client.

685
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,760
你会说  "伊莱  你写得太好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're gonna say, "Eli, this is fucking brilliant.

686
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,160
我都等不及想看到结局了"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"I can't fucking wait to see how it ends.

687
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,930
你  我的朋友  真是个才华横溢的天才
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You, my friend, are one fucking talented motherfucker."

688
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,570
亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, sweetie.

689
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,770
我刚没看到你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't see you there.

690
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,180
我现在要关门了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm shutting the door now.

691
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,490
好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}As well you should.

692
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,720
我找到你的眼罩了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I found your sleep mask.

693
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,120
拿过来  这里太亮了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bring it here. There's too much light.

694
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,570
什么声音
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What the hell was that?!

695
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,650
有人刚撞到了我的车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Somebody just rammed into my car.

696
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,600
卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl?

697
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,360
-你都干了些什么  -很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What have you done? - I'm so sorry.

698
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,800
我为了躲一只猫猛打了方向盘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I swerved to avoid a kitten.

699
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,480
这不是乔伊斯·杜博纳家吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Isn't this Joyce Dubner's house?

700
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,070
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes.

701
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,230
那乔伊斯在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So, where-where's Joyce?

702
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,430
娜奥米  你这么快就回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Naomi? You're back quickly.

703
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,620
外面出了什么事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What happened out there?

704
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,190
娜奥米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Naomi?

705
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,710
你一定是被烟呛到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you must be inhaling fumes.

706
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,330
你最好喝点水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You better get some water.

707
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,370
这是怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What happened here?

708
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,070
我刚从机场接了乔伊斯回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just brought Joyce home from the airport.

709
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,550
她病了  还有你丈夫刚撞上了我的车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's ill, and your husband just crashed into my car.

710
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,920
是的  我当时在开车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, and I was out for a drive

711
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,080
为了不撞上一只小狗不得不急打了方向盘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and had to swerve to avoid hitting a puppy.

712
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,350
你不是说是小猫吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought it was a kitten.

713
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,780
反正是一只有毛的跑得很快的东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it had fur and moved quickly.

714
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,360
总之  撞车了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway, crash.

715
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,130
太好了  汤米回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, good, Tommy's back.

716
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,610
回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Back?

717
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,650
他刚在这给乔伊斯卧室的植物浇水
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, he was here spraying the plants in Joyce's bedroom,

718
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,360
然后我让他去药店给她买药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I sent him to the drugstore for her pills.

719
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,540
还真是巧啊  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, wasn't that lucky, dear?

720
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,280
汤米刚好在卧室
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Seems Tommy was right there in the bedroom

721
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,940
正派上用场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}ready to be useful.

722
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,160
回家见  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I'll see you at home, Karl.

723
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,690
我要去继续跑步了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have to finish my jog.

724
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,070
是吗  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you, darling?

725
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,310
因为我很肯定你已经跑完了[事情败露]
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}'Cause I'm pretty sure the jog is up.

726
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,340
我不理解你为什么不开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't understand why you're not happy.

727
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,300
今晚很成功
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tonight was a triumph.

728
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,870
你应该在街上起舞
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You should be dancing in the street.

729
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,120
是的  我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. I know.

730
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,910
可能是我真的希望罗伯能来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Guess I just really hoped Rob would show up.

731
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,350
亲爱的  会好起来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sweetie, it's going to be okay.

732
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,790
不  不会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, it's not.

733
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,060
再也不会好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not going to be okay ever again.

734
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,900
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, why not?

735
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,350
因为我爱上他了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because I'm falling in love with him.

736
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,260
伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli?

737
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,800
发生什么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's going on?

738
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,190
拉马尔刚打给我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just got a call from Lamar.

739
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,710
好吧  他说了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay. What did he say?

740
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,480
他说这是我写过的最好的剧本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He said it's the best thing I've ever written.

741
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,440
-真的吗  -是的  他说我写得很有智慧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Really? - Yeah. He said it's smart

742
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,350
而且很刺激  还有伊娃那个角色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and exciting and that the character of Eva

743
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:41,070
很"五味杂陈"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}is "Deliciously complex."

744
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,510
然后他要我不要烂尾  但是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And then he told me to not fuck up the ending, but, I mean,

745
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,470
重点是  他很喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the point is, he loved it.

746
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,850
-我为你高兴  -天呐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'm so happy for you. - Oh, my God.

747
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,970
我该怎么谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How do I even begin to say thank you?

748
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,270
我没做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't do much.

749
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,200
你有  你知道的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, you did. You know you did.

750
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,860
如果我真的擅长写作的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And if I was actually good at what I do,

751
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,710
我应该想出比"谢谢你"更好的辞藻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I would come up with something better than just "Thank you,"

752
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,950
但现在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but for now,

753
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,890
我只能想到这句话了  所以谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that's all I got, so thank you.

754
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,910
不  我接受
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, look, I'll take it,

755
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,400
-我接受  -谢谢你  谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'll take it. Oh. - Thank you, thank you.

756
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,650
恭喜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Congrats.

757
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:23,130
泰勒不在我们可以这样吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A-Are we allowed to do this without Taylor?

758
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,170
我不确定
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not... not sure.

759
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,200
你觉得我很傻吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think I'm stupid, don't you?

760
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,320
我绝不会这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I would never say that.

761
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,910
这不在计划当中
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now this was not the plan.

762
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,480
我不应该这么在意他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was not supposed to care this much.

763
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,020
他今晚没出现
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When he didn't show up tonight,

764
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,780
让我顿悟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}it just... hit me.

765
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,070
我现在该怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What am I gonna do now?

766
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,820
我有种预感他在家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have a hunch he's happier at home

767
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,980
远比在你面前表现得幸福
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}than he's led you to believe.

768
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,360
也就是说他会继续让你失望
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Which means he'll continue to disappoint you.

769
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,390
你现在不需要那些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't need that right now.

770
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,440
你的事业终于开始有了起色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your career is finally taking off.

771
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,330
你应该享受这段时光
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You should be enjoying this time,

772
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,590
而不是为别的女人的丈夫神魂颠倒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}not mooning over some other woman's husband.

773
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,010
要是他和她在一起那么幸福
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, why would he even be with me

774
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,870
为什么还要跟我在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if he was so happy with her?

775
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,300
或许她做了什么伤害他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe she did something to hurt him

776
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,450
他需要时间去忘记她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he needs time to forgive her.

777
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,020
我不是很理解
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't really understand that.

778
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,910
很晚了  我该走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's late. I should go.

779
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,720
你该好好睡上一觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you should get some sleep.

780
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,660
希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila.

781
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,070
你真是个贴心的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are such a good friend.

782
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,210
我觉得或许你是我有史以来最好的朋友了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think you're maybe the best I've ever had.

783
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,210
你今晚真的很出色
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You really were wonderful tonight.

784
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,090
我要借用下你的卫生间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to use your bathroom.

785
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,560
里面很乱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, uh, it's a mess.

786
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,970
我可以先整理下吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can I just clean up first?

787
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,030
不了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No!

788
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,900
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is everything okay?

789
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,680
我可能要在里面待一会了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, I... I may be in here a while.

790
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,470
宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, baby.

791
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,570
罗伯  你好  你怎么来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob. Hi... What are you, what are you doing here?

792
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,010
我想知道你的演出怎么样了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wanted to come hear about your show.

793
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,750
很顺利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, it went great.

794
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,290
那就好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, good.

795
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,250
我们应该庆祝下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mm, we should celebrate.

796
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,810
我不行  我朋友在这儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I can't. My friend is here.

797
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,400
我没看到人呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't see anybody.

798
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,740
她在厕所
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's in the bathroom.

799
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,630
她怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's wrong with her?

800
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,500
她好像腹泻
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think she has diarrhea.

801
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,820
最近腹泻的人很多
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Lot of that going around.

802
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,020
过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come here.

803
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,070
我们能明天再谈吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can we talk tomorrow?

804
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,560
我现在不就在吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm here now.

805
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,860
现在不方便
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now is not a good time.

806
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,070
我有重要事情要跟你说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I have something important to tell you.

807
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,750
别啊  现在别说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't tell him. Not now.

808
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,090
是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What is it?

809
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:47,080
-不  你醉了  -我就喝了两瓶啤酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- No. You're drunk. - I had two beers.

810
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,060
说吧  给我个提示
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on, give me, give me a hint.

811
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,660
这个...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well...

812
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,550
我最近想了很多我们的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have been doing a lot of thinking about us,

813
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,520
我意识到了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I realized something.

814
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,800
你要跟我分手吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you breaking up with me?

815
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,370
天  不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}God, no.

816
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,140
好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

817
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,150
我爱上你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm in love with you.

818
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,470
我就是想知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just... I just thought it would be nice to know

819
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,030
你对我的感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}how you felt about me.

820
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,360
我不会离开我妻子的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not leaving my wife.

821
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,550
不  我不是叫你离开她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, no, I'm not asking you to.

822
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,950
我觉得就是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}See, I think you are.

823
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,400
我觉得你喝多了  现在不太适合谈这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think you're too drunk to have this conversation.

824
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,680
你用了"爱"这词后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When you start using the "L word,"

825
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,380
男人可以很快清醒过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}a guy can sober up pretty quick.

826
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,690
你不爱我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't love me?

827
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,010
我觉得你很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think you're great.

828
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,790
你觉得我很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You think I'm great?

829
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,110
这就是你的回复
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's your response?

830
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,690
你知道规则的  我当初说得很明白
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You knew the rules. I was very clear.

831
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,210
我永远不会离开我妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I will never leave my wife!

832
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,140
-请别吼我  -你让我生气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Please don't yell at me. - Well, you're making me angry!

833
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,800
好吧  好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, okay, okay.

834
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,550
我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I...

835
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,070
那...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So...

836
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,100
我怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}where does that leave me?

837
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,520
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't know.

838
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,280
我想你该走了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think that you should go.

839
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,750
你还好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You okay?

840
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,640
嗯  他一般不这么跟我说话的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, he usually doesn't speak to me that way.

841
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,470
通常情况下他人都挺好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's normally very kind.

842
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,650
亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, honey.

843
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,670
我希望他妻子能意识到她有多幸运
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I hope his wife appreciates how lucky she is.

844
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,490
我可不确定她有这么幸运
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not sure she's that lucky.

845
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:10,950
所以...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So...

846
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,690
汤米·哈特
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy Harte.

847
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,800
我知道他有点小
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know he's a bit young...

848
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,050
只是有点吗  我第一次见他的时候  他才8岁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A bit? When I met him, he was eight.

849
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,860
你那时还是直男呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And you were heterosexual.

850
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,890
现在这小屁孩成了你情人了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And now this child is your lover?

851
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,560
谁曾想到通奸和日托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who knew there was such a fine line

852
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,530
差别这么小
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}between adultery and day care?

853
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,150
你滚  卡尔  你没资格评判我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bugger off, Karl. You have no right to judge me.

854
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,250
我没有评判你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm not judging you,

855
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,960
我只是在戏弄你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm just teasing.

856
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,370
要说有什么的话  我为我们感到开心  喝酒吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If anything, I'm happy for us. Drink?

857
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,330
白兰地  什么叫你为我们感到开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Brandy. What do you mean you're happy for us?

858
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:42,680
你不明白吗  我们不需要离婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, don't you see? We don't need to get a divorce.

859
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:46,340
我们无意中卷入了这完美的安排
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We have stumbled into the perfect arrangement.

860
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,610
你有你的情人  我也有我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You will have your lovers and I will have mine,

861
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:52,130
然后我们回家八卦我们的情事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and then we will come home to sparkling conversation.

862
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,440
这很欧洲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's very European.

863
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,730
你不介意我和别人上床吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It doesn't bother you that I'm having sex with someone else?

864
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,440
亲爱的  我是同性恋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Darling, I'm gay.

865
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,250
对我来说  和女人做爱就好比腾空洗碗机
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, for me, sex with a woman is like emptying the dishwasher.

866
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,380
要是有人求我和女人做  我会的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, I'll do it if I'm asked,

867
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,660
但如果有人自告奋勇  我也不会抱怨
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but if someone else volunteers, I won't complain.

868
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,870
你知道我很喜欢这件衬衣的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh. You know I love this shirt.

869
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,150
你可以说你要喝伏特加啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You might've asked for vodka.

870
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,880
我不懂  你怎么会不吃醋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't understand. How can you not be jealous?

871
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,340
抱歉  你想让我吃汤米·哈特的醋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry, wait, you want me to be jealous of Tommy Harte?

872
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,730
他吃你的醋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's jealous of you!

873
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,680
那是应该的  我是你老公
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So he should be. I'm the husband.

874
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:27,830
不会太久了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not for long.

875
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,620
你要怎么做  和我离婚再嫁给汤米吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, what are you gonna do, divorce me and marry Tommy?

876
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,670
-也许我会的  -很好  我会给你们准备礼物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Maybe I will. - Oh, good. Well, I'll get you a gift.

877
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,940
你们什么时候去登记  费雪玩具要吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where will you be registered? Fisher-Price?

878
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,200
不是什么都是笑话的  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Everything is not a joke, Karl.

879
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,250
你这不是好笑  是冷酷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're not being funny, you're being cruel.

880
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,940
亲爱的  我可不想冷酷无情  我爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, darling, I'm not trying to be cruel. I love you.

881
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,300
不  你不爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, you don't!

882
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,940
不是我需要的那种爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not the way I need.

883
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,860
我想要一个深爱我的男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want a man who loves me so much

884
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,800
如果我和别人睡了  他会愿意去杀了那男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that he would kill another man if I slept with someone else.

885
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,630
但是你永远做不到  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I'm never gonna get that from you, am I?

886
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:58,710
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

887
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,650
可你是我最好的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But you're my best friend.

888
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,660
这不够
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's not enough.

889
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:22,540
该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit.

890
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,400
喂  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah? Hey, babe.

891
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,200
怎么这么小声
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey. Why are you whispering?

892
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,070
我在写作  你懂的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, I was just, I was writing, so, you know...

893
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,160
我需要点时间才能从"脑海中的"声音
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...takes me a minute to get out of the "In my head" Voice

894
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,630
回到我"大声说话的"声音
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and back into the "Out loud" Voice.

895
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,750
-进展如何  -会议很顺利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- How did everything go? - Oh, the conference was great,

896
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,420
我的姐妹们还是老样子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and my sisters... are my sisters.

897
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,960
-嗯  -如果你在工作的话  我不想打扰你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah. - Look, if you're working, I don't want to stop you.

898
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,030
洁德醒着吗  我可以跟她聊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, is Jade up? I can talk to her.

899
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,810
她好像去遛狗了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I-I think she's walking the dog.

900
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,900
这个点去未免太晚了吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a little late for that, no?

901
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,650
嗯  不过...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, but, you know...

902
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,510
狗可分不清时间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}dog can't tell time, so...

903
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,290
我很高兴你打电话过来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm, uh... I'm glad you checked in.

904
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:22,150
当然  我爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Um, I love you.

905
