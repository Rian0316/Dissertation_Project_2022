1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,139
Previously on AMC's
"Better Call Saul"...

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:05,831
I'm curious about your strategy.

3
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:07,693
I don't intend to take
it easy on your brother

4
00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:10,140
- just because he's a lawyer.
- Of course not.

5
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:11,971
The PPD was Chuck's idea.

6
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:14,734
- What are you gonna do?
- He just wants my law license.

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,909
I'm not gonna let you
fight this on your own.

8
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:18,978
- My watch.
- Allow me.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,712
Hector's your competition.

10
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:23,938
It's not in my interest
for him to die at this time.

11
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:25,796
You want to disrupt his supply line.

12
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:27,430
I would not stand in your way.

13
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:02,445
Ah.

14
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:20,829
Ah.

15
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:06,298
Ah.

16
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:16,368
Sì, señor.

17
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,173
Ah.

18
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,192
Whoa.

19
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,435
¿Eh?

20
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,673
Ahhhh.

21
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:57,548
Whoa.

22
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:06,681
Ahhh.

23
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,790
Guau.

24
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,173
Mm.

25
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:50,954
Mm?

26
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:46,587
Pop?

27
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:48,040
Hey, honey.

28
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:49,846
Almost didn't recognize the number.

29
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:51,560
I'm sorry.

30
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,218
They changed my hours up at work.

31
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:55,534
I'm still gettin' used to it.

32
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:57,998
How are you two?

33
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,517
We're great.

34
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,201
Did it go okay?

35
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:03,537
Yeah, yeah, thanks to
those movers you got.

36
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,839
All I had to do was watch.

37
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,511
And, Pop, this house...

38
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:10,744
It's good?

39
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:12,620
It's great.

40
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:14,248
Kaylee loves her new school.

41
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,103
The neighborhood's friendly.

42
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,951
We feel safe.

43
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:19,786
That's good.

44
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:22,289
Mike, I don't know how to thank you.

45
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,458
Well, you don't have to.

46
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,528
I'm just glad you're enjoying it.

47
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,884
Do you want to come over for dinner?

48
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,126
Tonight?

49
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:34,401
Sure. I'm making lasagna.
There'll be plenty.

50
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:39,273
Well, that's very sweet, but
I don't want to put you out.

51
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,974
Pop-pop, come over!

52
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:44,112
There's someone here
who wants to see you.

53
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:00,935
Ice cream!

54
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:04,690
Oh, is she snoozing?

55
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,278
Close.

56
00:10:07,136 --> 00:10:08,735
Ice cream?

57
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:11,505
I shoulda let well enough alone.

58
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:13,774
Well, I can't understand it.

59
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:16,443
According to the map, we were
supposed to be taking a shortcut.

60
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,011
I'm good.

61
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:20,013
- You sure?
- Yeah.

62
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,315
I'll have his.

63
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:22,916
Oh, I don't think so.

64
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:25,652
Maybe we can get a lift.

65
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:34,899
Hey!

66
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:35,929
What's the matter?

67
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,331
There's some guys
hanging around the truck.

68
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,599
Air Raid Wardens?

69
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:40,100
No, these is funny-lookin' guys.

70
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:41,702
What do you mean "funny-lookin'"?

71
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:43,475
I mean funny-lookin', like fish.

72
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,672
Who are you kidding? What
do you mean "like fish"?

73
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:47,288
- They got scales.
- Hey.

74
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,609
- Where?
- All over 'em!

75
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,195
You okay?

76
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:53,547
Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

77
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:56,210
They're off a flyin'
saucer, off a sputnik.

78
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:58,217
Ohh, look! They've seen us!

79
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,663
Let's get outta here!

80
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:01,266
They're from outer space.

81
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,290
They're off a flying saucer!

82
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:09,578
Receipt.

83
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,365
Eh.

84
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,533
Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. May I take your order?

85
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:49,002
¿Tu jefe esta aquí?

86
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:51,271
Ah...

87
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,073
¿Donde esta?

88
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,856
Uh, men's room is over
there on the left, sir.

89
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,612
Cabrón, I need to see your boss.

90
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:01,048
Okay. Well, I'm... I'm
the assistant manager.

91
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,516
The manager's actually not here today.

92
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:05,686
Not the manager... the boss.

93
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,922
- You mean Mr. Fring?
- Mr. Fring.

94
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:12,504
O-okay, well, he's
not here at the moment.

95
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,989
Uh, I'm sure I could help
you with whatever you need.

96
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,881
I need Fring.

97
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,299
Well, like I said, he's not here,

98
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,901
uh, and I don't really
know when he'll be back.

99
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:22,946
I can... I can take a message.

100
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:24,654
I'll wait.

101
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,775
You... you don't have to do that.

102
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:30,410
I'd be happy to take a message.

103
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:33,286
Uh, I'm sure Mr. Fring wouldn't
want to keep you waiting.

104
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,453
Uh, okay, sir, if
you... if you don't mind,

105
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:41,684
there are oth... there
are other customers.

106
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:45,993
Uh, s-sorry about that.

107
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:48,294
Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.
Uh, may I take your order?

108
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,519
Yeah, can I get a 12-piece bucket,

109
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,747
uh, with jumbo fries...

110
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,336
and, uh...

111
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:56,755
- You said the 12-piece?
- Yeah, the 12-piece.

112
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,061
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

113
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,481
Uh, excuse me, sir.

114
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:01,738
You can't light that in here.

115
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:03,129
Sir!

116
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:05,809
There's no smoking on the premises.

117
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,534
Please, sir, look... look at the signs.

118
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,022
No fumar.

119
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:15,467
You can't. That's... it's a...
it's a health-code violation.

120
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,922
- Uh, sir, it's employees only.
- We have to go, okay?

121
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,296
Let's go.

122
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:26,843
Sir!

123
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,084
Sir!

124
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,530
Sir, you're not allowed back here.

125
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,800
Gus Fring is a pillar of
our local business community,

126
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:11,122
and not just for underwriting
our travel raffle,

127
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:13,714
but for making the best
damn chicken in town!

128
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:17,097
- Gus.
- Thank you.

129
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,789
Thank you.

130
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,938
Well, uh, gentlemen, ladies, uh,

131
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:23,293
I-I hope to never need your services...

132
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,907
I mean, no offense, but...

133
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,930
if I ever did, it's good to know that...

134
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,016
Yes?

135
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,695
I'll be right there.

136
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:25,369
I want you all to go home now.

137
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,439
You will be compensated
for your full shifts.

138
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,720
Normal schedule tomorrow.

139
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:37,189
Go now.

140
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,845
We are closed for today.

141
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,572
Mr. Fring, y-you sure you want
to be left with these guys?

142
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,289
I'm fine, Lyle.

143
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:55,539
- You go home.
- Should I call someone?

144
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,877
No.

145
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:59,476
That will not be necessarily. Truly.

146
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:00,911
Are you sure?

147
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:02,713
Please do as I ask.

148
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:04,314
I'll see you tomorrow.

149
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:16,862
He's waiting in the office.

150
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:19,963
I know where he is.

151
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:26,637
Don Hector.

152
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,006
Took you long enough.

153
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:42,800
Don Hector,

154
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:46,230
mine is a cartel business,

155
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:49,659
but it is mine.

156
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,626
And it is legitimate.

157
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:55,362
My employees are civilians.

158
00:16:55,668 --> 00:16:58,605
Your actions here today
have endangered them,

159
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,698
my interests, and those of the cartel.

160
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:07,015
I am the cartel.

161
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,043
And from now on, you are my mule.

162
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:14,103
You are going to bring my product north.

163
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:17,242
Mierda.

164
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,585
Ah.

165
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,531
I understand that your supply
line has been compromised,

166
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,905
and this is most unfortunate.

167
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:39,359
However, my trucks are
already at maximum capacity.

168
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:41,132
Make room.

169
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,640
Don Hector,

170
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,036
you must understand that
I answer to Juan Bolsa.

171
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:50,354
You want to cry to Bolsa, cry to Bolsa.

172
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:52,702
Or, hell, Eladio.

173
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:57,194
Adding more product will threaten

174
00:17:57,196 --> 00:18:00,163
the reliability of the entire operation.

175
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:02,546
May I ask...

176
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:06,030
did Don Eladio approve this?

177
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:11,857
I approve this.

178
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:24,215
You're doin' it.

179
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:17,640
You gonna let me out of here?

180
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:19,835
Hello?

181
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:30,480
Tell him we're square.

182
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:32,773
What? No.

183
00:21:57,772 --> 00:22:00,216
Excuse me, everyone.

184
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:03,061
Could you all please take a
moment and join me out here?

185
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:05,029
Please, come.

186
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,921
Come, come, come.

187
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,993
I would, uh,

188
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:26,684
I would like to apologize
to each and every one of you

189
00:22:26,686 --> 00:22:31,016
who, yesterday, had to endure
the behavior of those men.

190
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,094
It was unacceptable.

191
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:40,270
Despite the difficult circumstances,

192
00:22:40,295 --> 00:22:44,465
you all acquitted yourselves impeccably.

193
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,793
That said,

194
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,464
if any of you wish to seek counseling

195
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:51,909
due to lingering trauma,

196
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:56,504
speak with me privately,
and it will be arranged.

197
00:22:56,895 --> 00:23:01,452
Also, you will all be
receiving 24 hours of overtime,

198
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:03,754
as I am sure, in one way or another,

199
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,253
each of you brought this
incident home with you.

200
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:08,215
Uh, yes, Lyle?

201
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,904
Mr. Fring, uh...

202
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:13,372
who were those guys?

203
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:19,570
Well, some of you know,
that many years ago,

204
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,739
I opened my first Los Pollos Hermanos

205
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:23,739
in Michoacán.

206
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:28,021
Shortly thereafter,

207
00:23:28,046 --> 00:23:32,247
those same men showed up.

208
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:35,486
They wanted money.

209
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:38,552
And I-I am...

210
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:42,966
I'm ashamed to say that I paid them.

211
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:47,632
You see, in that place, at that time,

212
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,724
if I wished to conduct my business...

213
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:52,803
I had no choice.

214
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:55,223
but yesterday...

215
00:23:58,678 --> 00:24:02,427
yesterday, they came here.

216
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:04,782
Here.

217
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:09,718
They intimidated my customers.

218
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:12,578
They threatened my employees.

219
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,169
And, again,

220
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,250
they wanted money.

221
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:22,528
Now, my friends, I-I must confess

222
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:25,723
that I almost gave
them what they wanted.

223
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:29,146
But then, I thought, "No.

224
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:31,296
"No.

225
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:34,646
"This is America."

226
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:39,404
Here, the righteous
have no reason to fear.

227
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,693
Here, those men have no power.

228
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,345
And when they saw that
I had no fear of them,

229
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:48,647
they ran like the cowards they are.

230
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:50,831
Back across the border.

231
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:55,297
They will not return.

232
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:58,425
We will move on from this.

233
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,464
My friends,

234
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:03,651
I promise you...

235
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,978
that together, we will prosper.

236
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:11,713
All right.

237
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:20,269
Yes, hi. I'm still here.

238
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:23,215
Really? Uh, are you sure?

239
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:24,883
Sure. Gotcha.

240
00:25:24,885 --> 00:25:26,659
Sorry for bothering you.

241
00:25:30,913 --> 00:25:32,570
Hi. I'm calling because

242
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:35,376
we had an appointment with you guys for,

243
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:38,242
I think, Wednesday?

244
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:39,375
I'll be honest with you...

245
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,000
I can barely read my
own darn handwriting.

246
00:25:42,002 --> 00:25:43,635
My mistake.

247
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:45,337
Okay. Have a nice day.

248
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:53,383
Hello. I'm calling to confirm an
appointment for Charles McGill.

249
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,719
Yes, it's 215 San Cristobal Road...

250
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:58,487
McGill, with an "M."

251
00:25:58,512 --> 00:25:59,646
A door?

252
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:00,871
Oh. Okay.

253
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:02,829
I thought it was you guys.

254
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,199
Guess I was wrong.

255
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:05,524
Thanks, anyway.

256
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:10,975
Hi! I'm calling about an
appointment for Charles McGill.

257
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,165
Well, that's why I'm calling.

258
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:15,352
I think it's for this week, but...

259
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:17,672
Good thing my head's
attached to my neck, right?

260
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:19,504
San Cristobal... that's right.

261
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:23,508
Yes, that's it! 2:30 tomorrow.

262
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,938
Great!

263
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:28,631
So, uh, we're gonna need to cancel that.

264
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:30,025
Yeah.

265
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,550
I will.

266
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,619
Thank you. Bye.

267
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:40,524
Ohh, poor Frisky.

268
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:44,296
Mm. Pomeranians can be
difficult... all that hair.

269
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:46,008
I know.

270
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:49,225
So, Mrs. Vallance, does
Thursday 11:30 work?

271
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:52,046
That's right.

272
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,022
No.

273
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:55,264
Really?

274
00:26:55,335 --> 00:26:58,203
Martin's Handyman and
Repair... 2:30 tomorrow.

275
00:26:58,205 --> 00:26:59,350
Thank you.

276
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,583
How many calls did that take?

277
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:03,875
I lost track. Is that it?

278
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:06,277
Yeah. I'm nearly done.

279
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:09,155
I'm just giving it a remorse pass.

280
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,169
Well, remorse is important.

281
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:20,366
"Destroyed property."

282
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,929
Hmm. I'd try...

283
00:27:24,954 --> 00:27:26,825
"damaged" the victim's property

284
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,086
instead of "destroyed" property.

285
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:31,202
- See if you can't get away with that.
- Yeah.

286
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,410
Boom.

287
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:40,438
Oh. That's nice.

288
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:44,134
I mean it, by the way.

289
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,401
What?

290
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,791
Thank you.

291
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:50,721
Seriously.

292
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:54,192
You're welcome seriously.

293
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:59,846
- I better get back to it.
- Yeah.

294
00:28:00,854 --> 00:28:02,200
Are you...?

295
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:06,504
You're absolutely sure you
got the right guy for this?

296
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:10,885
Oh, uh, the crème de la crème.

297
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:42,668
Martin's Repair?

298
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:44,755
- Yeah. Mr. McGill?
- Good afternoon.

299
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,949
If you don't mind wiping your shoes?

300
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:50,880
It's this way.

301
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:58,823
Mind... mind the step here.

302
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:01,626
Uh, as you'll see, the
frame is boarded over,

303
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:04,762
but the, uh, the door itself is intact.

304
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:07,628
The damage is mainly to
the doorjamb and the casing.

305
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:09,577
There's another step up here.

306
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,589
- Ohh.
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,781
- Break-in?
- That's right.

308
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:30,867
Went after your copper
wire, from the look of it.

309
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,826
There was a time... remember?

310
00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:37,262
When we could leave our doors unlocked.

311
00:29:37,264 --> 00:29:39,233
I certainly do.

312
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:41,133
Well...

313
00:29:41,648 --> 00:29:43,561
Where do I plug in?

314
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:44,719
You don't.

315
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:46,053
- No?
- No.

316
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,672
Didn't you...

317
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:50,498
I believe my assistant was very
clear with your dispatcher...

318
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:52,010
no electricity,

319
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:55,213
due to a condition that was
explained in some detail.

320
00:29:57,984 --> 00:29:59,617
No problem.

321
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:01,286
Good thing I charged my battery.

322
00:30:01,288 --> 00:30:04,578
I'd be going at it like
Fred Flintstone, otherwise.

323
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,288
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

324
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:11,329
I understood there would be
no power tools of any kind.

325
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,607
What? A screwdriver and a hammer?

326
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:15,633
Turns a morning job into two days

327
00:30:15,635 --> 00:30:17,969
with me, myself, and Bengay.

328
00:30:17,971 --> 00:30:19,737
But... it's your call.

329
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:24,734
I suppose...

330
00:30:25,912 --> 00:30:27,754
Very well, if...

331
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:40,443
You seem to be making fast work of it.

332
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:43,281
That's good. That's good.

333
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:46,086
Um, okay, what I'll
do, I think, is, uh...

334
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:23,277
Very good.

335
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,035
Oh, yeah.

336
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,910
Nice.

337
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:30,450
Great.

338
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:31,811
Yep, nice.

339
00:32:31,835 --> 00:32:35,371
At some point, we should probably
discuss the rule of thirds,

340
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:37,697
but, otherwise, these, uh...

341
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:41,223
Oh, wow. Yep.

342
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:44,855
A gas lantern sitting on a stack
of friggin' Financial Times.

343
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,914
Now, that tells the whole story.

344
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:49,105
These are museum quality.

345
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,597
You, my friend, are the Ansel
Adams of covert photography.

346
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:57,301
And that other thing?

347
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:12,324
How'd you get it?

348
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:15,090
Address book on his desk.

349
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,402
Right.

350
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,777
So...

351
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,160
what'dya think of him?

352
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:27,288
I mean, speak freely. You
couldn't possibly offend me.

353
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,004
He's a bit of a prick, right?

354
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:34,262
Nothing?

355
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,972
Seriously?

356
00:33:36,402 --> 00:33:38,011
All right.

357
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:40,574
Can't even dish the dirt with this guy.

358
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,363
Isn't our business concluded?

359
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,830
Yeah, even Steven.

360
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:49,629
- I mean, you did fix the door, right?
- Yeah.

361
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,691
Y-you did a reasonably good job of it?

362
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:54,205
- Because, otherwise, he'll be...
- He won't be grumbling to anyone.

363
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,850
That's all I'm asking.

364
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:57,832
I did it right.

365
00:33:58,425 --> 00:33:59,954
Thank you.

366
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:04,121
Nice to fix something for once.

367
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:06,504
Hell, if that's how you feel,

368
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:09,746
I got a leaky toilet back at the office.

369
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:11,980
All right.

370
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:14,606
If you ever need anything from my end...

371
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,140
Hasta luego.

372
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,397
May we talk?

373
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:01,016
You can park it over there.

374
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,139
You sent back the
payment we agreed upon.

375
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:31,859
What I did, I didn't do for you.

376
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:37,930
The man.

377
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:41,883
The one killed for
helping the truck driver.

378
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:46,307
If I may make an observation...

379
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,564
Perhaps you are trying
to correct something

380
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,401
which cannot be corrected.

381
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:56,437
It's not the kind of thing
I want to take money for.

382
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:59,016
But the fact remains that your actions

383
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,242
benefited me more than you can know.

384
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:03,311
That's your business.

385
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:07,446
I'm just glad to have
Salamanca out of my head.

386
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,374
Well, perhaps, in the future...

387
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,304
you will consider working for me.

388
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:28,409
Could be.

389
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:31,249
That'd depend on the work.

390
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:47,743
Would you care to know why...

391
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:50,650
I stopped you from killing Hector?

392
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:54,432
Like you said... it
wasn't in your interest.

393
00:36:56,705 --> 00:37:00,822
A bullet to the head would
have been far too humane.

394
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:49,058
Jimmy.

395
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,910
Howard.

396
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:05,229
Jimmy.

397
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,343
Howard.

398
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:27,668
- Kim.
- Chuck.

399
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:29,281
Kim.

400
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,558
Good afternoon.

401
00:39:03,355 --> 00:39:06,276
Oh! Good.

402
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:07,924
Mr. McGill, does this work for you?

403
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:10,360
It'll have to do. Thank you.

404
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:13,464
I assume everyone left
their cellphones and so on

405
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:15,098
at reception.

406
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,386
Yes, indeed.

407
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:19,869
And you'll let me know if you
need a break or anything else?

408
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,738
I will. Thank you, Ms. Hay.

409
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,657
You know...

410
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:27,410
I was actually speaking to my
husband about your condition.

411
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:28,659
Oh, yes?

412
00:39:28,684 --> 00:39:30,780
I had an aunt. She's no longer with us.

413
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,749
She went to church every Sunday,

414
00:39:32,774 --> 00:39:34,878
but when the boys' choir sang,

415
00:39:34,903 --> 00:39:37,287
she would absolutely have to leave.

416
00:39:37,312 --> 00:39:39,811
Something about the
frequency of their voices

417
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,658
really did a number on her.

418
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,380
- Well, that is a shame.
- Indeed.

419
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:46,436
All right.

420
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:50,010
Let's get down to it.

421
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,736
We are here to finalize

422
00:39:52,761 --> 00:39:56,396
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion
for James Morgan McGill.

423
00:39:56,398 --> 00:39:59,907
Representing the divertee,
Ms. Kimberly Wexler.

424
00:39:59,932 --> 00:40:02,568
Mr. James McGill has signed a contract

425
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,337
waiving his rights to a speedy trial

426
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,005
and presentment of his case

427
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:08,241
within the statute of limitations.

428
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:10,510
The terms of the deal
are for you, James,

429
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:12,779
to report to your
Pre-Prosecution Service Officer

430
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:15,181
at the Albuquerque
District Attorney's Office

431
00:40:15,183 --> 00:40:17,450
on the second Monday of every month

432
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:19,492
for the next 12 months.

433
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,688
Community service
hours will be assigned.

434
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,391
You must maintain lawful employment.

435
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:29,351
Must only associate with
law-abiding citizens.

436
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:30,718
Your client understands that,

437
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:33,232
if he violates the
terms of the agreement

438
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:35,701
or is arrested for any infraction,

439
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:37,703
the crimes to which
he has confessed here

440
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:40,306
will be prosecuted to the
full extent of the law,

441
00:40:40,308 --> 00:40:41,980
in addition to any new charges?

442
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:43,309
He understands.

443
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:45,044
And I must inform you, Mr. McGill,

444
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:48,949
as an officer of the court
and member of the bar,

445
00:40:48,974 --> 00:40:50,883
your confession will be referred

446
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:53,528
to the New Mexico Bar Association.

447
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:56,789
Okay. I have your statement here.

448
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:59,425
Has everyone had a chance to read it?

449
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:01,260
Comments? Thoughts?

450
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:03,095
Actually, page 2,

451
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:05,965
he "damaged the victim's property."

452
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:08,100
Would it not be more accurate to say

453
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:10,436
"destroyed a cassette tape"?

454
00:41:10,438 --> 00:41:12,939
I'm sorry. Wasn't the
cassette tape his property?

455
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:15,241
- Of course it was.
- Then it seems entirely accurate to say

456
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:17,245
he damaged the victim's property.

457
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,481
Why be vague?

458
00:41:18,506 --> 00:41:21,216
And "damaged" doesn't reflect
its irrevocable condition...

459
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:23,649
Fine. "Damaged property
belonging to the victim."

460
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:25,251
It was a cassette tape.

461
00:41:25,253 --> 00:41:27,687
That's what it was... not
a teacup, not a chair...

462
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:29,689
- a cassette tape.
- Yeah.

463
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:33,303
How about "destroyed item
of personal property"?

464
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:35,094
All right.

465
00:41:35,096 --> 00:41:38,865
Uh, we'd suggest "destroyed
item of personal property."

466
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,499
Ms. Wexler?

467
00:41:40,872 --> 00:41:42,635
Works for us.

468
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:44,395
Shall I change it, or...?

469
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,838
If you would.

470
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:54,461
"Destroyed item...

471
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:57,794
"of personal property."

472
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,323
There.

473
00:41:59,348 --> 00:42:01,655
Can you initial it, please?

474
00:42:02,524 --> 00:42:06,007
"JMM." Initialed.

475
00:42:07,562 --> 00:42:10,162
Charles, was there anything
else you found wanting

476
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:12,671
in your brother's statement?

477
00:42:14,223 --> 00:42:15,529
No.

478
00:42:15,554 --> 00:42:17,036
We're satisfied. Thank you.

479
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,318
All right. So, we're all set.

480
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:24,176
No, not all set, Mr. McGill.

481
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:26,512
Your brother may be
satisfied, but I am not.

482
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:29,682
The confession you've
written is adequate,

483
00:42:29,684 --> 00:42:33,152
but, frankly, I-I
sense a lack of remorse.

484
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:36,015
And I, for one, would
like to hear an apology.

485
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,707
Charles deserves at least that much.

486
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:40,927
Uh...

487
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:44,580
- Now?
- Yes, Mr. McGill, now.

488
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:50,236
Okay.

489
00:42:51,723 --> 00:42:52,872
I was wrong.

490
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:56,557
Mr. McGill, could you at least
look your brother in the eye?

491
00:43:05,976 --> 00:43:07,765
Chuck...

492
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,508
I'm very sorry.

493
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,528
I lost my temper, and
I did some things...

494
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,908
so many things that I regret.

495
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:23,258
I shouldn't have broken down your door.

496
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:27,054
Doesn't matter how I was provoked.

497
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,115
I-I shouldn't have done that.

498
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,047
There's no excuse for that.

499
00:43:31,168 --> 00:43:34,557
Or for the things that I said.

500
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,287
I regret it all,

501
00:43:38,312 --> 00:43:41,035
all of it more than you can imagine,

502
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,789
because...

503
00:43:43,725 --> 00:43:45,461
'cause you're my brother,

504
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:50,296
and no one should treat
his own brother like that.

505
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:52,198
Not ever.

506
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,829
Okay?

507
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,406
All right, then.

508
00:44:00,408 --> 00:44:02,241
On to the matter of restitution.

509
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:04,176
Mr. McGill, according to your agreement,

510
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:05,984
you have two weeks to
pay your brother back.

511
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,648
I would like to pay up now, if I may.

512
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,259
You may.

513
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:13,619
The amount is $321.

514
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:16,022
Uh, Ms. Hay. I'm sorry.

515
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:18,790
That figure doesn't
represent a full accounting.

516
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,844
Oh, no?

517
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:24,313
I believe the correct amount is $323.98.

518
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:26,932
That includes the cassette tape...

519
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:28,687
which was destroyed.

520
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:30,055
Good. Thank you.

521
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,056
$323.98,

522
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:36,343
including the cassette tape.

523
00:44:57,565 --> 00:44:59,545
What do you say we get you home?

524
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,703
Howard. Chuck.

525
00:45:03,705 --> 00:45:06,572
I'm putting you both on notice
regarding the bar hearing.

526
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:08,908
The first thing, I'm filing a
motion to suppress that tape.

527
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,910
The tape that Jimmy destroyed, you mean?

528
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:13,428
How about we stop with the games?

529
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,081
There's no way there isn't a duplicate.

530
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:16,415
Really?

531
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,017
Of course there is.

532
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,405
You knew Jimmy was gonna break in.

533
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,600
You wanted him to.

534
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,968
There's no way you were
gonna let him destroy

535
00:45:22,993 --> 00:45:25,461
the only copy of that tape,
so you made a duplicate...

536
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:27,389
- it's the first thing you did.
- Kim...

537
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:28,928
this is not how we do discovery.

538
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,029
Actually, Jimmy destroyed the duplicate.

539
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:34,404
Ah, it's fine, Howard.

540
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:37,570
The original is under lock
and key, and in due time,

541
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:40,172
it will be put into
evidence for your review.

542
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:42,675
So, of course, file
whatever motions you'd like.

543
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:44,844
- It's your privilege.
- I will. Count on it.

544
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:46,946
But, Kim, you should be aware...

545
00:45:46,948 --> 00:45:48,581
because I believe this will be

546
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,583
your first disciplinary hearing...

547
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:53,474
uh, the Bar Association's
standard of proof

548
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:56,388
is far more lenient
than what you're used to.

549
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,716
Motions aside, that tape will be played.

550
00:46:01,372 --> 00:46:02,795
- Chuck.
- Yeah.

551
00:46:03,132 --> 00:46:04,489
See you, Kim.

552
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,302
Well?

553
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:32,391
What?

554
00:46:32,502 --> 00:46:34,232
Bingo.
