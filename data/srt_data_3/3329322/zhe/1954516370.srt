1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,328
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
ELlJAH: Previously on The Originals...

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,802
这座城市曾经是我的家
我要夺回来
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

3
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,704
你自由了
走得远远的，永远不要回来
You are free.
Go far away and never come back.

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,607
每个狼人在今晚都会
变成长毛利齿的野兽
Every werewolf will be a bundle
of fur and sharp teeth tonight

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,270
而你们被诅咒的新月狼族会变成…
whilst your cursed clan will be--

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,972
人类，但只能维持几小时
Human, but only for a few hours,

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,015
再变身只能等下个满月了
and won't be again
until the next full moon.

8
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,676
- 我叫杰克森
- 你就是那头一直看着我的狼
-I'm Jackson.
-You're the wolf who's been watching me.

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,119
你应该是我的妻子
You were supposed to be my wife.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,518
这是研磨成糊状的草药
SABlNE:
It's herbs ground into paste.

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,626
下一次月圆，你的族人变成人类时
On the next full moon,
when your people become human,

12
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,762
给他们吃下，诅咒便会解除
feed it to them,
the curse will be broken.

13
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,922
我被下咒了
我不知道我还剩多长时间
I've been hexed,
and I don't know how long I have.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,126
祖先们说如果我再滥用我的魔法
The ancestors said
they'd do horrible things to me

15
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,100
他们会严厉地惩罚我
if I misused my magic again.

16
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,399
马赛勒斯，你被驱逐了
Marcellus, you are hereby exiled.

17
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,975
如果我发现你的踪迹
你不会有好下场的
If I so much as find a trace of you,
it will not end well for you.

18
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,205
干得好，哥哥
你说话的语气开始像我了
Nicely done, brother.
You're beginning to sound like me.

19
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:57,019
人们说时间能治愈所有伤口
KLAUS: They say the passage of time
will heal all wounds.

20
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:05,763
但失去的越多
伤口就越深
But the greater the loss,
the deeper the cut.

21
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,770
你也越难走出其中，彻底痊愈
And the more difficult the process
to become whole again.

22
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,405
痛苦或许会消退
The pain may fade,

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,776
但伤疤会提醒我们曾经的痛苦
but scars serve as a reminder
of our suffering...

24
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,277
让我们越加下定决心
...and make the bearer
all the more resolved,

25
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,787
绝不让自己再受到伤害
never to be wounded again.

26
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,891
随着时间过去
So, as time moves along...

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,427
我们在诱惑中迷失
...we get lost in distractions.

28
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,099
在挫败中发泄
Act out in frustration.

29
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,738
用暴力来反抗
React with aggression.

30
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,679
屈服于愤怒
Give in to anger.

31
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,878
一直以来
And all the while...

32
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:04,320
我们密谋计划，等待着自己强大的一天
...we plot and plan
as we wait to grow stronger.

33
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:12,627
不知不觉中，时光流逝
And before we know it,
the time passes.

34
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,265
我们的伤口被治愈
We are healed.

35
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,931
准备好重新开始
Ready to begin anew.

36
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,772
听起来你已经战胜了自己内心的恶魔
Spoken like a man
who's made peace with his demons.

37
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,973
我的恶魔已经死了
至少被赶走了
My demons are dead or chased off.

38
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,120
是的，除了这个与你同床缠绵的恶魔
Yes, apart from the one lingering monster
with whom you share a bed.

39
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,490
我想你能自己找到衣服和门
I trust you can find your clothing
and the door.

40
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:53,933
你应该没忘记那个女人
是如何折磨我们妹妹的吧
You do recall that woman
tortured our sister?

41
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,507
也是她才让我知道了我们妹妹的背叛
She also revealed the truth
about our sister's treachery.

42
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,610
正因如此，蕾贝卡永远地离开了我们
And as a consequence,
Rebekah is gone forever.

43
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,542
我想她一定早有此意
A desire which she apparently
harbored for quite some time!

44
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,113
尼克劳斯，已经一个月了
Niklaus, it has been a month.

45
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,444
我和你一样痛心失去我们的妹妹
Now, I feel our sister's loss
as deeply as you.

46
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,678
你不能再如此放纵自己
继续过这种荒唐的生活
You must stop distracting yourself
with this ridiculous behavior

47
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,322
而是将悲伤转化为力量
and channel it
into some kind of action.

48
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,321
我为什么要这样做？
Why must l, exactly?

49
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:16,189
因为在马赛尔掌权的这些年
这城市已习惯了有国王的统治
Because over the course
of Marcel's tenure,
the city grew accustomed
to having a king.

50
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,626
既然你想要这个宝座
You wanted this throne.

51
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,460
你就必须承担随之而来的责任
You must accept the responsibility
that accompanies that.

52
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,033
很抱歉
Apologies.

53
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,467
但我更想追求别的东西
But I'm rather ensconced
in other pursuits.

54
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,597
如果你能如此轻易抛弃这个家
If you can so easily neglect your home,

55
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,836
我真不知道你的女儿将来会怎样
I wonder what will become
of your daughter.

56
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,072
难道你已经忘了
在暴力的威胁下生存的滋味了吗？
Have you forgotten what it was like
to live beneath the threat of violence?

57
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:40,811
我们必须同心协力，尼克劳斯
We must work together, Niklaus.

58
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,148
让我们来重建这个城市吧
Let's make this city whole again.

59
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,691
或许已经伤害太深，无法补救了
Perhaps it is too broken to mend.

60
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,499
如果你不愿意做的话，那我来
If you won't do anything, I will.

61
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,812
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：波旁街之月

62
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,718
圣安妮教堂一直是这个城市
的中立之地
FATHER KlERAN: St. Anne's has long been
neutral ground in our city.

63
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,352
所以我们今天聚集于此
主演：约瑟夫摩根
So, it's only fitting
that we gather in this chamber

64
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,849
应以利亚米卡森的要求
at the behest of Elijah Mikaelson

65
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,187
为这个我们称之为家的地方带来和平
to bring harmony
to this place we call home.

66
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,885
谢谢大家过来
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
-Thank you all for coming.

67
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,760
没错，谢谢，欢迎各位
-Yes, thank you, and welcome.

68
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,936
这是马赛尔杰拉德订下的规矩
主演：菲比托金
These are the rules of the city
according to Marcel Gerard.

69
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,207
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯

70
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,572
当然不再有任何效力
Which of course no longer apply

71
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,839
因为如今我做主
主演：莉雅派普斯
because I am in charge.

72
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:40,906
你说过如果我们出席的话
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
You said if we came along,

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,915
你会同意让我们自己做主
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
we would run things by ourselves.

74
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,482
你可没说过自己要当国王
Never mentioned anything
about making yourself king.

75
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,416
你们是从每个群体中推选出来的代表
You were each selected to represent
your own communities,

76
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,055
我对此表示尊重
 I'll honor that.

77
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,124
但如果不同势力之间起了冲突
那就由我来解决
However, issues which arise
between factions will come to me.

78
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:58,128
我们每个人或多或少都对这个城市
当下的泥乱状况有些责任
Now, we are all, to some extent,
responsible for the current chaos.

79
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,860
但你们都面对着一个非常简单的选择
However, you have one very,
very simple choice ahead of you here.

80
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,803
大家一起和平共处
不然就离开这里
You can all play nicely together,
or you can leave.

81
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,088
看，黛维娜，很容易的
只要努力就行
See, Davina? It's easy.
All you have to do is try.

82
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,988
我在努力了
I am trying.

83
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,154
怎么努力都还是失败
自从你回来后就一直这样
Trying and failing,
ever since you came back.

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,924
你什么时候才能不再针对我
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
When are you gonna stop
being such a bitch to me, 

85
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,661
莫妮克？
Monique?

86
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,329
当你不再软弱的时候
制片：兰斯安德森
When you stop being weak.

87
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:42,370
你本来是个收获祭女孩
但或许你不属于这里
You're supposed to be a Harvest girl,
but maybe you don't belong here.

88
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,039
或许你从来就不属于这里
Maybe you never did.

89
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,050
你不是应该去跟那群小子
拚个你死我活吗？
Shouldn't you be out there
playing Fight Club
with the rest of the frat boys?

90
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,783
不用，这只是为了争夺族群地位
That's just for pecking order.

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,451
他们早就知道谁是老大了
They already know who's the Alpha.

92
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,067
制片：邦妮怀斯

93
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,103
下一个，来吧
Next up! Let's go!

94
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,411
你一定要尝尝塔克做的肋排
You got to try Tucker's ribs.

95
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,182
然后呢？
编剧：蜜雪儿侃洛戴斯
Then what?

96
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,621
再去玩玩马蹄铁吗？
编剧：克里斯多福贺利尔
Then we're gonna go play horseshoes?

97
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,088
别嘲笑乡村生活，亲爱的
导演：麦可罗宾森
-Don't mock country living, darling.

98
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:33,717
抱歉
-Sorry.

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,490
我还不习惯这种快乐的家庭生活
This is just a lot more family fun
than I'm used to.

100
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,495
也许我能帮你适应这种生活
Well, maybe I can help you
get used to it.

101
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,326
所以我们要做的就是忘记
OLlVER:
Then all we got to do is just forget

102
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,662
她此生一半时间与人类生活
she spent half her life with humans

103
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,827
另外一半与吸血鬼生活的事实
and the other half with vampires.

104
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,599
- 奥利，别说了
- 没关系
-Ollie, back off.
-It's okay.

105
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,472
小矮个儿有话说，那就说吧
If the runt of the litter
has something to say, he should say it.

106
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:56,775
你知道吗，法语区都在说你的男人
以利亚正在举行什么权力高峰会
Word from the Quarter is your boy
Elijah's holding some power summit.

107
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,440
猜猜谁没受到邀请
Guess who wasn't invited.

108
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,053
- 你从哪里听来的？
- 那不重要
-Where did you hear this?
-lt doesn't matter.

109
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,054
重点是我们被困在这片沼泽
The point is, we're stuck here
living in the swamp

110
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,125
而你的吸血鬼男友
却在决定着城市该如何分配
while your vampire boyfriend's
deciding who gets what in the city.

111
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,925
但我想这也能证明他到底有多
尊重狼人族群，是吧？
I guess that shows how much respect
he's got for the werewolves.

112
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,632
这也是我们的城市
(CROWD ARGUlNG)
This is our city, too.

113
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,638
- 我们应该可以去任何想去的地方
- 我们会认为那就是宣战
We should be able
to go wherever the hell we want.

114
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,402
这样毫无进展
你们这群卑鄙的生物无法同意…
Nowhere.
You vile creatures cannot agree--

115
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,638
神父，请冷静
Father, calm yourself, please.

116
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,339
谢谢
Thank you.

117
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,974
现在回到边界的问题
你们都得遵守以下规定
Now, about the issue of boundaries,
you will all heed to the following.

118
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,780
你是认真的吗？
HAYLEY: Are you serious?

119
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,719
你们在瓜分城市
而狼人竟然都没有发言权？
You're dividing up the city,
and the werewolves don't get a say?

120
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,155
- 她来这里干什么？
- 迪亚哥，坐下
-What the hell is she doing here?
-Diego, sit.

121
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,462
我们没有在瓜分城市
我们是在建立…
-We're not dividing the city--

122
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,623
不，以利亚
-No, Elijah!

123
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:52,396
如果你们把狼人排除在外
和平就不可能存在
There is not gonna be a peace
if the werewolves are excluded.

124
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,766
他们也想在谈判中有一席之地
They want a seat at the table.

125
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,608
如果没有
HAYLEY: And if they don't get one,

126
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,473
我敢保证你们都会后悔的
I can guarantee
that you will all regret it.

127
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,241
绝对不可能
我们会发动一场这城市前所未见的战争
WOMAN: We will start a war the likes
of which this city has never seen.

128
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,385
你知道光是把刚才那些人
聚集在同一个房间里有多困难吗？
Do you have any idea what it took just
to get those people in one room together?

129
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,116
事实上，我不知道
No, actually, I don't.

130
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,124
因为要不是有人告诉我
Because I didn't even know
what you were doing out here

131
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,353
我都不知道你们在这里做什么
until someone else told me.

132
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,623
告诉我，以利亚
Tell me something, Elijah.

133
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,495
你是因为我才把狼人排除在外的吗？
Did you leave the werewolves out
because of me?

134
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,330
我把他们排除在外是因为他们
不再住在法语区了
I excluded them because they no
longer reside in the French Quarter.

135
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,973
我的当务之急是要解决这里
日益增长的冲突
My immediate concern is to end
the mounting conflict here.

136
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,303
我向你保证，一旦协定确立
Now, I can assure you
once this treaty is solidified,

137
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,910
马上就会把你的族人纳进来
it will expand
to include your people.

138
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,606
在那之前呢，我要怎么跟他们说？
坐下，别动，打个滚吗？
Until then, I should tell them what?
Sit, stay, roll over?

139
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,774
我情愿你不要参与这件事
I'd prefer that you remove yourself
from the process altogether.

140
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,993
海莉，你真的确定
Hayley, are you absolutely certain

141
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,391
你不回到宅邸住吗？
that you shouldn't return
to the compound?

142
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,336
你觉得孩子属于那里吗？
You think the baby belongs there?

143
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,970
你觉得她在那里才会安全吗？
You think that's where she'll be safe?

144
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,368
难道河口就更好吗？
Is the bayou any better?

145
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,310
狼人应该有发言权
The wolves deserve a voice.

146
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,208
给他们发言权
Give them one.

147
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,082
你知道这样做才是正确的
You know it's the right thing to do.

148
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,152
你真该看看海莉进来时
你哥哥的表情
You should have seen
your brother's face when Hayley walked in.

149
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,795
看来新月诅咒被打破了
Crescent curse is broken then?

150
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,061
你觉得这能行得通吗？
Do you believe
this will actually work?

151
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,732
这个城市真的能够拥有和平吗？
That we can finally have some
semblance of peace in this city?

152
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,969
我从院子里看到你的灯亮着
就想赌一下…
I saw the light from the courtyard
and took a chance that...

153
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,738
你没和一个半裸的神经病女巫在一起
...you weren't
with a half-naked psycho-witch.

154
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,678
看来我赌输了
Seems I gambled and lost.

155
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,512
十分钟前，我是全裸的
Ten minutes ago,
I was fully naked.

156
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,781
那你的目的已经达到了
不耽误你了
Oh. Then you served your purpose.
Don't let me hold you up.

157
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,230
你们欧康诺家的人可真爱跟女巫找茬啊
You O'Connells sure do love
to piss off witches.

158
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,165
这是真的吗？
GENEVlEVE: Really?

159
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,237
那个女人曾经威胁我
The woman tried to blackmail me
into stabbing you

160
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,532
要我用神秘的刀刺你，让你痛不欲生
with the Mystical Knife
of Excruciating Pain.

161
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,508
奇怪的床伴就是纽奥良的特产啊
Well, New Orleans breeds nothing
if not strange bedfellows.

162
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,307
但我想你来这里应该不是因为
我的休闲生活吧
I assume you're not here to question me
on my leisure activities.

163
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,748
我来是为了我叔叔的事
他的病情在恶化
I'm here about my uncle.
He's deteriorating.

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,683
药物、冥想，都不管用了
The pills, the meditation,
they're not working.

165
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,755
他越来越不清醒了
His lucidity's shrinking by the day.

166
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,018
女巫下的咒，女巫可以解
Awitch did this,
a witch can undo it.

167
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,561
看来你跟洁妮薇的关系很好
也许你能说服她帮忙
You seem supertight with Genevieve.
Maybe you can persuade her to help.

168
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,699
没用的
It won't do any good.

169
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,027
这种诅咒是由魔法开始的
These hexes, they start with magic,

170
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,660
一旦生根
它们就会改变大脑的化学物质
but as they take root,
they alter the very chemistry of the brain.

171
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,164
我很抱歉，卡蜜
伤害已经无法挽回了
I'm sorry, Cami.
The damage is done.

172
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,335
我才不接受这种说法
I refuse to accept that.

173
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,277
如果你有家庭观念的话，你也不会接受
And you would, too,
if you had any concept of family.

174
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,457
小约
Josh.

175
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,027
黛维娜，你来这里干什么？
Davina, what are you doing out here?

176
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,636
你想在哪里见面我都可以过去
I would have met you
anywhere you wanted.

177
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,705
我是说，没有克劳斯和马赛尔的地方
I mean, not anywhere
Klaus or Marcel would be,

178
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,842
虽然他们俩几乎无处不在
which could be pretty much,
you know, anywhere.

179
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,806
但你明白我的意思
But you know what I mean.

180
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,145
嘿，你还好吗？
Hey. You okay?

181
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,618
是莫妮克
It's Monique.

182
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,279
她不知道我死后经历了什么事
She has no idea what I went through
when I was dead.

183
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:35,393
祖先因为我用魔法所做的一切而憎恨我
The ancestors hated me
for what I did with my magic.

184
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,722
我不能重新使用魔法了
I can't just start practicing again.

185
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,898
我知道马赛尔要我回去时我不该相信他
I knew I shouldn't have trusted
Marcel when he told me to go back.

186
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,897
我不知道我还能忍受多久
I don't know
how much more of it I can take.

187
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,708
- 又和那小女巫闹别扭了吗？
- 我能搞定
THlERRY:
On the outs with the witch again?
I got it covered.

188
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,084
什么事这么重要
你还要把我带来这里？
What was so important you dragged me
all the way out here?

189
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,344
我有个提议
I have a proposal.

190
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,751
我希望你和所有跟着你离开克劳斯的人
站在我这边
I want you and all who walked out
on Klaus with you to join me.

191
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:09,793
- 召集军队吗？
- 没有军队就不能收回城市了
-Rounding up an army?
-Can't take back the city without one.

192
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,260
你一无所有
You have nothing.

193
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,991
没有武器，没有同盟
No weapons, no allies.

194
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,294
甚至一旦你靠近法语区
以利亚就会杀了你
You go even close to the Quarter,
and Elijah will kill you.

195
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,495
如果克劳斯没先杀死你的话
That's if Klaus doesn't get you first.

196
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,539
所以呢，也许我该和你一样
躲在巴克镇吗？
So, what, maybe I should hide out
in Bucktown like you?

197
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,303
我想你同意来见我是因为
你不想离开你的家
I think you're here 'cause
you don't wanna leave your home.

198
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,209
我当然也不想离开我的家
I sure as hell don't wanna leave mine.

199
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,384
战争一触即发，小提
A battle is brewing, T.

200
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,985
大家都忙着选择阵营
While everyone's busy
choosing sides,

201
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,520
我会想办法夺回我们的城市，所以…
I'm gonna find a way
to take back our city, so...

202
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,282
你要和我一起吗？
You with me?

203
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,394
你总是说得好听，马赛尔
You were always great with words,
Marcel.

204
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,091
但这次除了高谈阔论还得有些别的
But it's gonna take
more than a pretty speech this time.

205
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,412
真的有这必要吗？
Is that really necessary?

206
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,952
这种病，正在逐渐
压过我宽恕的意愿
The sickness,
it's overtaking my inclination to forgive.

207
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,716
在高峰会上，我满脑子只有一个念头
Replacing it with one thought that
I could barely contain at the summit.

208
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,756
把他们统统杀死
"Kill every last one of them."

209
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:19,956
我们会想出办法的
We'll figure it out.

210
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:24,660
我之前试图帮助西恩
I tried to figure it out with Sean.

211
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:31,240
但我太专注于此
而没能试图阻止他
But I was focused too much on that
instead of trying to stop him.

212
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,244
我不会让这一切发生在我身上
And I'm not--
I'm not gonna let that happen to me.

213
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,076
你是欧康诺家的人
You're an O'Connell.

214
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,449
他们会叫你接替我的位置
They are going to ask you
to take my place at the table.

215
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,318
别答应，离开这里
Don't. Just leave.

216
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,959
重新开始
Just start over.

217
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,118
只要还有机会我就哪都不会去
I'm not going anywhere
as long as there's still a chance.

218
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,925
我要跟你说多少次
我没法恢复了
How many times do I have to tell you
I can't be fixed?

219
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,761
我要跟你说多少次
我绝不会放弃尝试
How many times do I have to tell you
I will not stop trying?

220
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:00,531
真是太顽固了
跟你小时候一样
That is just stubbornness,
like when you were a little girl.

221
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,869
你总是要证明自己是对的
你从不听话
You always had to be right.
You... You never listened.

222
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,204
真是太愚蠢了
Just that thick head of yours.

223
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,003
我为你祈祷
I prayed for you.

224
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,151
没有回应
And I got no answer.

225
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,844
只有黑暗
There is only blackness.

226
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,116
只有死亡
There is only death.

227
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,892
有我的
There's mine.

228
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,354
还有你的
And yours.

229
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,898
不，不，不要
No, no, no!

230
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,305
不要
No!

231
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,422
- 米卡森先生
- 科雷亚女士
-Mr. Mikaelson.
-Miss Correa.

232
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,430
请叫我佛朗西丝卡
Please call me Francesca.

233
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,069
我们可以省去那些客套话了
科雷亚女士
We can dispense
with any formalities, Miss Correa.

234
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,364
我知道你是谁
I know exactly who you are.

235
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,237
你是皇宫赌场的老闪
You own the Palace Royale Casino.

236
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,640
你是城里重要的慈善家之一
You're one of the city's
leading philanthropists.

237
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,302
据我所知，你还是一位
And according to my sources,
you're the matriarch

238
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,609
相当庞大的贩毒帝国的首领
to a rather sizeable
drug trafficking empire.

239
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,475
为什么找我来？
-So why am I here?
-Whatever you may think of me,

240
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,090
不管你怎么想我
我的家族多年来都是人类决策群的一员
my family's been a part
of the human faction for years.

241
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,351
这就让我有资格接替基兰神父的位置
Which makes me uniquely qualified
to take father Kieran's place.

242
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,586
从现在起，你将和我打交道
You'll deal with me from now on.

243
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,027
你是在命令我吗？
Are you giving me a mandate?

244
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,189
不是
No.
(LAUGHS)

245
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,301
我是要和你结盟
I'm giving you an ally.

246
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,337
我和你一样想要和平
I want peace just as much as you do.

247
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,204
我非常喜欢的生活方式
My lifestyle,
which I enjoy very much,

248
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,366
依赖和平
depends on it.

249
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,378
是的，我看得出你非常积极
Yes,
I can see you're highly motivated.

250
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,108
你知道吗，我应该告诉你
You know, I should mention,

251
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,844
我已经和新市长、警察局长
和其他利益相关团体
I've already spoken to the
city's new mayor and the chief of police

252
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,387
谈过了
and other interested parties,

253
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,491
他们都支持我
and I have their blessing.

254
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,389
你会发现有我站在你这边对你有利
I think you'll find it beneficial
to have me on your side.

255
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,963
即使只能够避免我不太文明的同胞
Even if it's just to prevent
my less civil brethren

256
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,967
从各方面攻击而给你们带来不快
from lashing out in ways
that could prove painful to you.

257
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,573
祝你今晚愉快
Have a good night.

258
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,125
不喜欢天蓝色吗？
Not a fan of cerulean blue?

259
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,097
不喜欢你继续这么漠不关心
Not a fan
of your continued indifference.

260
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:46,396
要想让一个曾经互相憎恨的群体
Well, it's difficult
trying to unite a community

261
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,199
团结起来是很难的
that has a history of mutual loathing.

262
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,342
- 省省你那些陈腔滥调吧，尼克劳斯
- 那就说点有建设性的
-Spare me the platitudes, Niklaus.
-A perspective then.

263
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,876
如果你想要和平，你首先要从狼人开始
If you want peace,
you must begin with the werewolves.

264
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,981
一百年前，他们统治着这个城市
A hundred years ago,
they had a run at ruling this city.

265
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,514
随后，他们只能够
As of late, all they've had is time

266
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,675
看着他们的敌人
毁掉一切他们的辛苦成果
to watch their enemies
tear down that legacy.

267
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,822
这正是为什么他们的敌人
不愿让他们重回谈判桌
All the more reason why their enemies
are reluctant to bring them to the table.

268
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,618
学学比恩维尔，哥哥
Take a page from Bienville, brother.

269
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:12,127
如果谈判桌是个障碍
那就挪开它
If the table's the obstacle, remove it.

270
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,356
你还记得1720年
Do you recall in 1720

271
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,331
总督迫切希望得到我们的帮助
the governor's desperation
to secure our help

272
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,267
建造城市的第一个防洪堤吗？
to build the cities first levees?

273
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,897
我们和他谈了，拒绝了他
We sat with him
and refused his offer.

274
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:28,979
所以他不断奉上美酒和穿胸衣的女人
And so he plied us with wine,
with corseted women,

275
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,675
不停套交情，直到我们答应他为止
and with raucous camaraderie
until he had his yes.

276
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,015
你是建议我办个派对吗？
Are you suggesting
that I throw a party?

277
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,486
让我惊叹啊，哥哥
I'm impressed, brother.

278
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:16,822
是啊，如果我能不让他们把彼此
撕成碎片就好了
Yes, now if I can just keep them
from tearing one another to shreds.

279
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,795
那么为了你，敬超级无聊的夜晚
Then for your sake,
here's to a spectacularly boring evening.

280
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,738
怎么了，小个子？
What's up, little man?

281
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,542
他不值得你动手
He's not even worth it.

282
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,417
既然你心事重重
我就凭直觉想像你的赞美好了
Since you're preoccupied,
I'll intuit your flattering compliment.

283
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,895
谢谢，我也觉得我很美
Thank you.
I think I look stunning, too.

284
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,292
我相信你挑选礼服的时间
I trust you've spent as much time
fortifying alliances

285
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,495
与你加强同盟的时间一样多
as you clearly have
selecting that dress.

286
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,440
这么说你的确注意到我了
So you do notice me.

287
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,743
是的，我已经处理好码头的纠纷了
And, yes, I've already settled
the dispute over the docks.

288
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,007
我答应女巫提高她们墓地旅游的分成
I pacified the witches with
an increased share in cemetery tours,

289
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,413
我也给了新月族重新变回人形的贺礼
and I've given the Crescents
a welcome back to humanity gift

290
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,383
我赌场里价值一百美金的筹码
in the form of 100 dollar chips
to my casino.

291
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,013
我想，我应该来杯香槟，你说呢？
So, I think I deserve some champagne,
don't you?

292
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,326
你知道，考虑到基兰不断恶化的病情
You know, in light
of Kieran's deteriorating condition,

293
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,091
其他人默许了你的提议
the others have acquiesced
to your proposal.

294
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,032
你将代表人类决策群直到他重新回来
You will represent the human faction
until he's ready to resume.

295
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,803
那我们可要好好利用这有限的时间了
Then I suggest we make the most
of our limited time together.

296
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,969
天啊
God.

297
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,732
听着，你要是指望我向你求饶
我不会再这么做了
If you expect me to beg for my life,
that's not me anymore.

298
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:13,174
你以为我是来杀你的？
我是为黛维娜而来
You think I'm here to kill you?
I'm here about Davina.

299
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,474
你听说高峰会的事了吧
You heard about the summit.

300
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,776
如果谈判破裂
If it falls apart,

301
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,579
每一方都会寻找筹码来对付其他方
each faction's gonna look
for leverage against the other ones.

302
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,221
黛维娜得能够保护自己
Davina has to be able
to defend herself,

303
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,186
如有必要，还得防着自己人
even from her own people if need be.

304
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,756
她必须要再次使用魔法
She has to start doing magic again.

305
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,487
你为什么跟我说这些？
Why are you telling me?

306
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,792
因为得有人告诉她
而她又不会听我的
Because someone has to tell her,
and she won't listen to me.

307
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,734
所以怎样，我告诉她
然后你试图让她重回你的阵营
So, what, I tell her, and you try
to get her back on your side.

308
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,736
是吗？继续拿她当你的私人武器？
Right, go back to using her
as your personal weapon?

309
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,375
我不在乎她最终会站在哪边
I don't care whose side
she ends up on,

310
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,306
只要她安全就好
just that she's safe.

311
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,242
因为我们都知道现在她并不安全
Because we both know
right now she isn't.

312
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,790
迪亚哥
Diego.

313
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,536
你要彬彬有礼表示欢迎
You will be polite and welcoming.

314
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,039
是啊，他的族人杀了我全家
Yeah, see,
his people killed my whole family.

315
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,543
我妹妹就躺在我旁边，流血过多而死
My sister bled out on the floor
right next to me.

316
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,544
我现在还能站在这里
The only reason I'm standing here

317
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,946
是因为马赛尔出现
在我血流干之前转变了我
is 'cause Marcel came along
and turned me before I bled out too.

318
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,746
所以我现在告诉你
So, I'm telling you right now.

319
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,718
我不可能彬彬有礼表示欢迎
I cannot be polite
and welcoming to that.

320
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,484
迪亚哥，我理解你的愤怒
Diego, I understand your anger.

321
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,560
然而，如果我们想要某种程度的和平
However, there are certain overtures
that need to be made

322
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,595
就必须稍稍示好
if we are to find a degree of peace.

323
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,701
欢迎来我家
Welcome to my home.

324
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,432
要不是海莉强烈要求，我是不会来的
I wouldn't be here
if Hayley hadn't forced the issue.

325
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,803
是的，你不太可能在这里
Yes, it's rather unlikely
that you'll experience

326
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,309
受到热情洋溢的款待
an outpouring of kind sentiment here.

327
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,609
特别是吸血鬼都将你们视为…
The vampires in particular
view you as...

328
00:21:58,784 --> 00:21:59,910
野蛮人
...well, barbaric.

329
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:04,249
海莉告诉我这个和平协定
对你来说很重要
Hayley tells me this peace treaty
is important to you.

330
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,412
是的，确实很重要
Yes, it certainly is.

331
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,182
所以说
So much so, in fact,

332
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,953
如果有任何人威胁要毁掉
我在这里建立的一切
that if anyone threatened
to dismantle what I'm building here,

333
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,096
我就会毁掉他们珍视的一切
I'd destroy everything they hold dear.

334
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,996
祝你今晚开心
Have a wonderful evening.

335
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,533
在我你的心理医生吗？
Looking for your shrink?

336
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,139
别告诉我你嫉妒卡蜜了，亲爱的
Don't tell me
you're jealous of Cami, love.

337
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:31,078
只是好奇你怎么会找她作伴
Just curious
why you'd seek her company.

338
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,685
她看起来很…普通
She seems so ordinary.

339
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,845
有时候，普通让人愉悦，让人放松
Well, sometimes,
ordinary is a welcome respite.

340
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,117
我还以为我能让你放松呢
I thought I was your respite.

341
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,851
你能啊
Well, you are.

342
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,222
你能
You are.

343
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,127
答应我别再想卡蜜了
Promise me
not another thought about Cami.

344
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,656
我很高兴你接受了我的邀请
I'm so glad
you accepted my invitation.

345
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,726
伟大的克劳斯米卡森要在这里
So, is this where the great
Klaus Mikaelson

346
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,228
说些尖锐的话然后扭断我脖子吗？
says something poignant
and snaps my neck?

347
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:25,166
我不是来杀你的
我是要给你一份礼物
I'm not here to kill you.
I'm here to offer you a gift.

348
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,568
出于你那吸血鬼的好意吗？
Out of the kindness
of your vampire heart?

349
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,436
其实你我比你以为的要相似
Our hearts are more similar
than you might realize.

350
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,444
早在我进化之前
我也是狼人
You see, long before I evolved,
mine beat as a werewolf.

351
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,174
我了解你们的能力
I know your power.

352
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,409
也了解你们的烦恼
I know your burden.

353
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,883
我是来为你们消除后者的
I'm here to take the latter away.

354
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,420
你想把我变成混合种
You want to make me a Hybrid.

355
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,060
我以我的族人为重
I put my pack first.

356
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,628
我不会让任何事危害到我的家族
And I'm not gonna let anything
compromise my family line,

357
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,359
特别是变成嗜血的吸血鬼寄生虫
especially becoming
some bloodthirsty vampire parasite.

358
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,299
那种自豪感
That pride...

359
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,197
那种忠诚
That sense of loyalty...

360
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,771
正是我到现在还没扭断你脖子的原因
Well, that's exactly why
I haven't snapped your neck yet.

361
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,937
如果你不打算杀我
那你到底想干什么？
Well, if you're not gonna kill me,
then what the hell do you want?

362
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:15,018
只是要把从你们手里
夺走的城市还给你们
Only to give you back
the city that was taken from you.

363
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,814
这尖锐吗？
How was that for poignant?

364
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,393
我为什么要相信一个
Why would I trust someone

365
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,088
背着自己哥哥搞鬼的人？
who's conspiring
behind his own brother's back?

366
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,757
我不是要破坏以利亚的计划
I'm not trying
to undermine Elijah's venture.

367
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,836
我是在支持他
I'm supporting his vision.

368
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,495
吸血鬼靠杀人来生存
Vampires destroy life to survive,

369
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,438
女巫逐渐衰落
witches are only as powerful
as their dead.

370
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,407
但狼人却日益壮大
The werewolves have thrived

371
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,013
因为他们的力量来自于家族的团结
because their strength
comes from family unity.

372
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:47,174
这样的团结正是我想要让
我未出生孩子所拥有的
The safety of that unity
is what I want for my unborn child.

373
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,656
令人不快的事实却是
The painful truth is...

374
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,156
吸血鬼从来就不团结
...vampires are the antithesis of unity.

375
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,220
所以怎样？
So, what?

376
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,889
一千年之后，你终于准备好接受
After a thousand years,
you're finally ready to embrace

377
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,036
你的另一半血统吗？
the other half of your family tree?

378
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,133
或许那一半并不欢迎你
Maybe the other half doesn't want you.

379
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,801
他们会的
只要能让他们回到法语区
Oh, they will
once they return to the Quarter.

380
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,751
你有什么计划吗？
You got a plan to back that up?

381
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,820
我母亲是个十分强大的女巫
My mother was a very powerful witch.

382
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,083
我见过她制作各式各样的魔法物品
I watched her craft
all manner of magical items.

383
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:31,059
但对她来说最宝贵的是这枚戒指
But her most prized possession
was this ring.

384
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,493
我已经有一千年没见过它
I hadn't seen it for a thousand years,

385
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,133
然后它出现了，挂在一个狼人的脖子上
and then it turned up hanging around
the neck of a werewolf,

386
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:40,897
我生父的直系后代
a direct descendant
of my biological father.

387
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:46,169
我相信我母亲给了他这枚戒指
是为了让他自由
I believe she gave him this ring
as a way of freeing him.

388
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,333
怎么说？
How so?

389
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,742
日光戒指保护吸血鬼不受阳光侵害
Daylight rings shield vampires
from the sun.

390
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,281
那为什么不能有一个月光戒指
So, why not a moonlight ring

391
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,248
保护狼人免受诅咒之苦呢？
to protect werewolves
from the curse?

392
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,785
想想看
Think about it.

393
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,923
不需再遭受断骨的痛苦
No more breaking bones.

394
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,423
不再受内心的野兽控制
No more losing control
to the beast within.

395
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,497
你想要我怎么做？
What do I have to do?

396
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,640
嘿
Hey.

397
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,839
- 你看起来…
- 紧张
-You look...
-Nervous.

398
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:25,380
格格不入，还是这礼服显得我很矮？
Out of place, short in this dress?

399
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,778
我本来想说美丽动人
I was gonna say pretty.

400
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,244
我叫奥利佛
I'm Oliver.

401
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,453
不知这位我想邀她共舞的小姐
叫什么名字？
So, what's the name of the girl
I'm about to ask to dance?

402
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,622
她叫莫妮克
Her name is Monique.

403
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,976
能请你跳支舞吗？
Would you care to dance?

404
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,312
派对办得真不错
You outdid yourself.

405
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,653
你甚至还说服了克劳斯参加
You even got Klaus
to come out and play.

406
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,988
如今恐怕也只有靠大型派对
Yes, it seems
that only a sizeable soiree

407
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:15,292
才能让我弟弟从画架旁离开了
is enough to tear my brother away
from his efforts at the easel.

408
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,163
这听起来可不妙
That's never a good sign.

409
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:22,170
克劳斯曾对我说过
他画画是为了控制自己
Klaus once told me that his painting
was a metaphor for control,

410
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,138
他会用尽各种手段
来实现自己内心的想法
for achieving his vision
through sheer force of will.

411
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,709
说实话，如果他那脑袋里
Well, truthfully, I'd be shocked

412
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,778
没有至少十几个阴险狡诈的想法
if he didn't have at least
a dozen or so of those visions

413
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:32,906
我才会奇怪呢
swarming around
in that insidious skull of his.

414
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,018
我衷心希望你女儿能遗传到她母亲的…
I do hope your daughter
inherits her mother's--

415
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,819
所有一切
Everything.

416
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,756
- 回到这里的感觉很奇怪
- 希望不是不愉快的感觉
-lt is weird being back here?
-Not unpleasant, I hope.

417
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,025
不完全是
Not entirely.

418
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:55,596
你确定不回来跟我们一起生活吗？
Are you entirely sure
you shouldn't be here with us?

419
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,467
为什么，以利亚？
Why, Elijah?

420
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:05,207
是因为你觉得
我跟那些狼人在一起不安全吗？
Because you don't think it's safe
in big, bad wolf country?

421
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,374
我可不会坐在摇椅上织婴儿袜
I'm not gonna sit in a rocking chair
and knit booties,

422
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,144
你到现在还不明白吗？
or haven't you figured that out yet?

423
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,515
- 能跟你谈谈吗，海莉？
- 你可以等会再谈
-Can I have a minute, Hayley?
-You can have it later.

424
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,487
事实上，他可以与我共舞这一曲
Actually, he can have this dance.

425
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,932
- 一切还好吗？
- 是的，没事
-Everything all right?
-Yeah. Fine.

426
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,038
我们只是在讨论这个城市的将来
We were just discussing
the future of the city.

427
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,538
这时候你怎么还想着这个城市？
How can you be thinking
about the city right now?

428
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,846
我真该告诉你你今晚有多迷人
I should have told you
how beautiful you look tonight.

429
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,365
别紧张，别紧张
Easy. Easy.

430
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,507
要薄荷酒吗？不过这里面没有糖和薄荷
Julep, minus the sugar and mint?

431
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,944
我刚刚见了基兰
他不会再伤害你了
I just saw Kieran.
He's not gonna hurt you again.

432
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,455
事实上，他离不开那个阁楼了
In fact, he won't leave the attic at all.

433
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,889
我找人施了个边界咒
I arranged
for a little boundary spell.

434
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,360
你找到女巫帮你了？
我还以为她们都恨你
You got a witch to help you?
I thought they hated you.

435
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,964
为了你，我找到了一个不那么恨我的
For you, I found one who doesn't.

436
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:34,067
- 怎么了？
- 没事
-Hey, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

437
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:39,365
你是这一个月来第一个帮我的人
You're the first person
to help me in a month.

438
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,976
基兰是我唯一的亲人
Kieran's the only family I have left.

439
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,243
没有他，我就是一个人了
Without him, I'm alone.

440
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,318
我明白
Yeah.

441
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,756
这些日子我也失去了很多亲人
Yeah, I'm a little short
on family myself these days.

442
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:01,224
如果有任何能帮到你的，卡蜜
尽管开口
Hey, if there's anything I can do to help,
Cami, just let me know.

443
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,825
是有件事
There is one thing.

444
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,131
我们的波本酒喝光了
We're out of bourbon.

445
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,245
狼人小子
Hey, wolf boy.

446
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,403
该叫他们帮你用饲料碗盛吗？
Should have had them
put it in a bowl for you?

447
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,072
你希望我用那个敲碎你的脑袋吗？
Well, yeah, if you want me
to crush your skull with it.

448
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,741
别这样，小伙子们
能争点有意义的事情吗？
Please, boys.
At least, fight over something interesting.

449
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,820
比如说我？
Me perhaps?

450
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,548
你不会想跟他们扯上任何关系的
No, you don't want to get involved
with his kind.

451
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,591
他们总喜欢无故发狂
See, they got this nasty,
little habit of going berserk

452
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,319
然后将无辜的人撕成碎片
and ripping innocent people
to shreds.

453
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,589
不不，好吧，听着
No, no, no. Okay, look.

454
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:39,032
如果我的族人做过任何伤害到你的事
我向你表示深切的歉意，好吗？
If my people wronged you in any way,
you have my condolences, okay?

455
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,469
不过如果他们都长得像你一样丑
我的族人绝对下不了口
I'd be surprised if my kin could choke
them down, being half as ugly as him.

456
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,444
现在就给我结束
This ends now.

457
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,714
- 我不会再说第二遍
- 放心，我们会结束这一切的
-I won't ask again.
-Oh, we'll end it all right.

458
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,188
你为什么不动手？
HAYLEY: What's stopping you?

459
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:06,787
杀了他
Kill him.

460
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,563
来啊，以利亚，动手吧
Go ahead, Elijah. Do it.

461
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,710
反正他死有余辜
I mean, it's not like
he doesn't deserve to die.

462
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,369
难道这时候你不该出面吗？
Shouldn't you intervene or something?

463
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,539
为什么？
这派对才刚刚开始有意思
Why would l?
This party just got interesting.

464
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,515
正是奥利佛把蕾贝卡交给了女巫
It was Oliver who handed Rebekah
over to the witches

465
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,483
让她受到百般折磨
so they could torture her.

466
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,555
但话说回来，上个月那场
But then again, wasn't it Diego

467
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,591
狼人大屠杀不正是迪亚哥带头的吗？
who led a werewolf massacre
last month?

468
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,091
而当女巫对狼人下咒时
And the witches cursed the wolves,

469
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,321
那些人类也只是站在一旁冷眼旁观
while the humans stood back
and let it all happen.

470
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,490
这么想的话
这里的所有人都该死
So when you think about it,
everyone here deserves to die.

471
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,693
你想说什么？
Are approaching a point?

472
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,202
我想说的是，以利亚
My point, Elijah, is this.

473
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,603
如果我们不能和平共处
If we can't all learn to get along,

474
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:55,007
如果我们各自的族群不能联手合作
if our families can't create
some sort of community,

475
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,544
那还有什么意义？
then what's the point?

476
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,115
不如杀掉彼此早点了事
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

477
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,698
我这辈子只收到过一次玫瑰花
JOSH: You know, I've only gotten
roses once in my life.

478
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,928
- 都没能保留下来
- 为什么？
-Didn't even get to keep them.
-Why not?

479
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,005
我的第一个男朋友，也是唯一一个
My first boyfriend,
my only boyfriend really,

480
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,904
毕业那年的情人节送给我的
gave them to me
for Valentine's Day senior year.

481
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,205
我试图把花藏在卧室
但被我父母发现了
Tried to hide them in my bedroom,
but my parents found them.

482
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,714
你可能不知道，但玫瑰花
会堵塞住最好的碎纸机
You may not know, but roses will jam
even the best paper shredders.

483
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:38,219
我没有家可回
You know,
I don't have a home to go home to.

484
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,923
或者一个接纳我的家庭
Or a family to go home to.

485
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,794
我曾因此恨我自己
I used to hate myself for that.

486
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,989
但事实是
But the thing is...

487
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,495
我真的不再在乎他们怎么想了
...I don't really care
what they think anymore.

488
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,567
如果你的家人不喜欢你现在的样子
管他们呢
If your family doesn't like you
the way you are, screw them.

489
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:04,012
你有我
有卡蜜
You got me and Cami.

490
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,843
如果你愿意，还有马赛尔
Even Marcel if you want.

491
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,116
马赛尔利用了我
Marcel used me.

492
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:15,157
他利用你去对付试图杀死你的人
He used you to fight the people
who were trying to kill you.

493
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:19,092
你知道，他也从那些人手中救了你
所以…
And, you know, he also saved you
from those people, so....

494
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,664
你不必相信他
但他的确爱你
You don't have to trust the guy,
but he does love you.

495
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,197
另外
And PS...

496
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,467
我也爱你
...so do l.

497
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,109
即使我没有魔法吗？
Even if I don't have any magic?

498
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:43,018
我所拥有的法力都来自于
其他收获祭的女孩
All the power I had
was from the other harvest girls.

499
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,213
我都不知道没有它我还有什么
I don't even know
what I have without it.

500
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,226
难道你不该自己去搞清楚吗？
Don't you owe it to yourself
to find out?

501
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,657
你是女巫，黛维娜
You're a witch, Davina.

502
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,998
你和我一样不能改变自己的本质
You can't change your DNA
any more than I can.

503
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,038
所以你不妨试着去接受
So, you might as well embrace it.

504
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,845
- 你还好吗？
- 只是擦伤
-You okay?
-Just some bruises.

505
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,250
- 我擦伤还没好呢
- 来
-I'm still bruised.
-Come on.

506
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,889
“擦伤”真是个有趣的词
"Bruise" is such a funny word.

507
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:56,185
发音和“酒”好像
我们还有酒吗？
It sounds like "booze."
Do we have any more booze?

508
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,090
没了，我想我们都喝完了
No, I think we drank it all.

509
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,861
你是个好朋友，马赛尔
You're a good friend, Marcel.

510
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,728
你该躺下休息了
You should lie down.

511
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,574
我受够了总是一个人
I'm tired of being alone.

512
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,972
我也是
I am too.

513
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:58,650
并不是说这样不好
Not that that wasn't totally worth it.

514
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,347
但绝对不能再发生了
It can never happen again.

515
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,652
要是我们当中有谁又想喝薄荷酒了呢？
What if one of us craves another julep?

516
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,464
不知为何，克劳斯信任我
For whatever reason,
Klaus trusts me,

517
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,330
而你大概是他现在最恨的人
and you're the person
he probably hates most right now.

518
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,494
他会觉得这是背叛
He'd see it as a betrayal.

519
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,435
这对我们俩都没好处
That wouldn't be good for either of us.

520
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,542
马赛尔
Marcel.

521
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,313
这真的非常棒
It really was totally worth it.

522
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,881
是的
Yeah, it was.

523
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,172
你说我一无所有
你错了
You said I had nothing.
You were wrong.

524
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:02,149
我有和第一次从灰烬中
重建这座城市时一样的东西
I have the same thing I had when l
rebuilt this city from the ashes the first time.

525
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,582
再无可失，获得一切
Everything to gain
and nothing to lose.

526
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:10,215
我有了进展，建立盟友
最重要的就是黛维娜
I'm making inroads, allies,
not the least of which is Davina.

527
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,522
除非我确定可以指望你
否则我不会离开这屋顶
And I'm not leaving this roof
until I can count you in too.

528
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:18,260
此外，我们说实话吧，小提
你只有我了
Besides, let's be honest, T.
I'm all you got.

529
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,101
我了解那些吸血鬼
他们不只是离开宅邸
I know those vampires,
they didn't just leave the compound.

530
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,970
他们彻底离开了纽奥良
They left New Orleans.

531
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,548
我们俩对抗全世界吗？
So, us against the world?

532
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,210
我们会有第三第四个伙伴
We'll get a third and a fourth.

533
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,550
很快，我们就会拥有整支军队
And pretty soon,
we're gonna have that army.

534
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,589
一切改变都从计划开始
KLAUS: All change begins with a plan.

535
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,054
（纽奥良 和平协定）

536
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:31,174
计划的成功取决于几个因素
The success of which
depends upon several things.

537
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,183
承诺的深度
Depth of commitment.

538
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,618
对目标的热情
Passion for one's cause.

539
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,197
- 嘿，敬海莉
- 敬海莉
-Hey! To Hayley!
-To Hayley!

540
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,806
开辟新路的意愿
KLAUS:
Willingness to embrace a new path.

541
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:27,230
克服一切困难的决心
Determination
to overcome any obstacle.

542
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:35,996
而有时
甚至是结交超乎寻常的同盟
And in some cases,
even making unnatural alliances.

543
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:40,166
你和克劳斯米卡森做了交易？
You made a deal
with Klaus Mikaelson?

544
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,869
我宁愿每个月圆日变身
I'd rather turn every full moon.

545
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,537
如果克劳斯没说错
If Klaus is right,

546
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,809
这个魔法不仅能阻止我们变身
this magic could do more
than just stop us from turning.

547
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,081
我们最终可以控制自己
We could finally control
what we are.

548
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,784
我们可以利用一切力量、一切速度
We could draw on all the strength,
all the speed,

549
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,396
我们狼形时的原始力量
the raw power of our werewolf form.

550
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:08,263
我们的咬伤将随时能让吸血鬼毙命
Our bite would be lethal to vampires
24/7.

551
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,378
猎杀我们的人类
诅咒我们的女巫
The humans who hunt us,
the witches who curse us,

552
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,451
憎恨我们的吸血鬼
我们将不再只与他们势均力敌
the vampires who hate us,
we wouldn't just be their equals.

553
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,759
我们将统治他们
We'd be their superiors.

554
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,788
- 签字
- 为什么？
-Sign it.
-Why?

555
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,686
你已经代表我方签了字
You've already done so
on our behalf.

556
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,827
弟弟，我不是傻瓜
Brother, I'm not a fool.

557
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,462
我很清楚其实你并不像表现出来的
那样漠不关心
You're not as disinterested
as you'd like me to believe.

558
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,495
请签字
Sign, please.

559
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,399
如果你我都不能和平相处
If there is no peace between us,

560
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,835
那你怎么能指望其他人跟随呢？
then how can you expect others
to follow suit?

561
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,974
好吧
如果这能让你开心
Fine.
If it will make you happy.

562
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:26,778
但我向你保证，这个城市的居民
不会遵守这个协定的
I assure you this city's inhabitants
will not adhere to this agreement.

563
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,918
欢迎你跟我打赌
Well, you are welcome
to wager against me.

564
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,488
你会输的
You will lose.

565
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,365
走着瞧吧
We'll see.
