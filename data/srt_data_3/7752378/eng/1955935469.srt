Very well.

360
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,387
The line in the sand has been drawn.

361
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,009

[QUIETLY]: Weirdo.

363
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,173
What was that?

364
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,441
You heard me.

365
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,045
Sir, I am a man with feelings.

366
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:27,048
And you have hurt them.

367
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:31,818
I know you've had a number of...

368
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,788
gentleman callers,

369
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,390
but I've never heard you
speak like this before.

370
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:37,868
"Gentleman callers"?

371
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:39,592
And we wonder where Sheldon gets it.

[LAUGHS]

373
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,629
I'm sorry y'all find this funny,

374
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,764
but this is the first time

375
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,923
my mother's expressed
real interest in a man

376
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,501
since Dad died.

377
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:49,439
Forgive me for wanting to know more.

378
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,506
You really want to know more?

379
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,043
Imagine you're getting on in years,

380
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:59,013
you and your husband about to retire,

381
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,954
get a little timeshare in Sarasota,

382
00:15:00,957 --> 00:15:03,958
and... suddenly...

383
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:06,094
he's gone,

384
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:08,556
and you're all alone.

385
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:11,058
You mourn, you cry,

386
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,628
but eventually you move on.

387
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,764
You start dating a little,

388
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:19,118
and it's all good fun.

389
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:21,354
But always in the back of your mind,

390
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:24,825
there's that question...

391
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:27,790
"Will I be alone in the end?"

392
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,915
[SNIFFLES]

393
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,829
Why y'all looking at me for?

394

[SNIFFLING]

395
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:41,121
Haven't slept in days.

396
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:42,890
It's like I'm a lovesick teenager,

397
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:46,327
except I remember the Truman
administration. [CHUCKLES]

398
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:48,673
Your feelings are understandable.

399
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:50,809
Connie is a remarkable woman.

400
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:52,278
Yes, she is.

401
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,735
But, again, I'm sorry. I should
never have called you weird.

402
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:57,038
I mean, eh, it was rude.

403
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,375
I've been called much worse.

404
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:03,844
A professor once
called me ostrobogulous.

405
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,251
I had to look that one up.

406
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:06,509
What's it mean?

407
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:08,048
That I'm a weirdo.

408
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,216
[LAUGHS]

409
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,610
John, you're a great guy.

410
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:13,020
Well, you, too!

411
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:14,782
But I hope you understand, I just...

412
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:16,360
I can't give up on Connie.

413
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:17,562
That's all right.

414
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:18,864
To tell you the truth,

415
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:22,946
I'm finding the competition
quite exhilarating.

416
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,138
You are?

417
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:25,485
Oh, yes.

418
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,923
The night the dinette set arrived,

419
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:31,561
I did my first push-up in 40 years.

420
00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:33,345
[LAUGHS, SNORTS]

421
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:35,665
I'm sorry, but I find that to be, uh...

422
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:38,068
What's the word... Astro-boobulous?

423
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:39,860
Ostrobogulous.

424
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:41,165
Ostrobogulous.

425
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,274
Exactly.

426
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:46,296
Now, give me your best price

427
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:47,831
on one of these

428
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,535
with a cup holder.

429
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:59,425
John! What a pleasant surprise.

430
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,100
- I have some news for you.
- Oh?

431
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:03,897
- Mwah. What is that?
- Mwah.

432
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,900
I went to the furniture
store and spoke to Ira.

433
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:10,194
- Why would you do that?
- To demand

434
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,936
that he respect your
wish to be left alone.

435
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:17,410
John, it was not your place to do that.

436
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,757
Well, if it helps,

437
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,315
he doesn't plan on leaving you alone.

438
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,825
What the hell were you thinking?!

439
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,493
That I was being chivalrous.

440
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:35,562
By going behind my back?

441
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,864
You seem upset.

442
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:39,158
I am upset!

443
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:42,460
And how I handle Ira is my business!

444
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:44,704
Well, I hope you do it gently.

445
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:46,718
He's very vulnerable these days.

446
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,254
You're friends now?

447
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:49,905
Well, I wouldn't say friends,

448
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:52,577
but I could see, over time,

449
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,549
- you know, we might...
- Are you two fighting?

450
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:56,814
No.

451
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,384
Oh, good. [CHUCKLES]

452
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:00,850
I was almost certain that we were.

453
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:01,952
We are.

454
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,530
- I'm confused.
- Me, too.

455
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,525
Is this because you went
to the furniture store?

456
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:06,693
He knows about this?

457
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:08,197
- BOTH: Yes.
- All right, now, listen,

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,596
if this relationship's
gonna have any chance at all,

459
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,365
we have to lay down some ground rules.

00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:13,733
Great. I love rules.

461
00:18:13,735 --> 00:18:14,983
I do, too.

I don't want you talking
to him about anything

463
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,803
having to do with anything about us.

464
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:19,804
Same with you.

465
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,940
And I want you to stop

466
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,876
spying on me with those binoculars

467
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:25,145
like you're on some
kind of African safari.

468
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:26,905
And you cannot talk

469
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:30,574
to Ira or any of my
ex-boyfriends, for that matter.

470
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,444
This list is getting long.
