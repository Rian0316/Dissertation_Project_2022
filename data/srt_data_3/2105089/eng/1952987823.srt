1
00:00:00,594 --> 00:00:02,061
Earl, can you break some 20's?

2
00:00:02,062 --> 00:00:03,395
The big spenders at table two

3
00:00:03,396 --> 00:00:05,197
wanna split their $11 check three ways,

4
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:08,701
even though one person
did all the eating.

5
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:13,472
I was in a three-way once.
Same thing happened.

6
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:20,279
Max, table ten would like the check.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,681
And don't forget to pick
up customer comment card.

8
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:24,750
Customers very important.

9
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,552
It's all about the fans.

10
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:29,622
Yeah, I'm not a fan of hearing
what people have to say.

11
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:31,590
For instance, what's
happening right now...

12
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:33,225
Not a fan.

13
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:36,295
Max, feedback from customers is
very important business tool.

14
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:40,099
Perhaps we'll pump the brakes
on sour waitress attitude.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,568
There's only one tool
that can change my 'tude,

16
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:44,003
But I'm gonna need two
double-a batteries.

17
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:47,139
And a 20-minute break.

Thanks for coming to very important.

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,854
First official diner meeting.

23
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:05,624
This ain't right, man.
2:00 A.M. starts Earl time.

24
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,892
Earl, here's your brandy.

25
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:10,729
Okay, we're good now.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,932
If I knew we were gonna have
staff meetings after work,

27
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:16,302
I would've taken job
at T.G.I. Friday instead.

28
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:19,571
Over there, they roll fast and loose.

29
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,273
Well, this is how I roll.

30
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:23,342
Yeah, short and slow.

31
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:29,315
No, I roll fast and furious.
Tokyo drift style.

32
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:32,885
Han, I'm starting to drift.
Can we get to the point?

33
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:35,521
Max and I still have to get home
and bake cupcakes for tomorrow.

34
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:39,091
We received so many excellent
comments from customers tonight.

35
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,893
Okay, first comment.

36
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:44,263
"dark-haired waitress..."
- hey!

37
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:45,798
"was very rude."

38
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,767
Hey!

39
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:50,035
Max, customers are giving.

40
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:51,437
Their honest opinions about diner.

41
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:53,472
We need to take it seriously.

42
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:58,577
"I'd like to ride the blonde
waitress like a tilt-a-whirl."

43
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,413
Shout out!

44
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:02,548
Next comment.

45
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,583
"why does cashier wear earphones?

46
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,285
I thought he was a dj."

50
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:12,992

52
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:19,164
It also says that cook
could wear deodorant.

53
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:21,200
And shirt that covers armpit.

54
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:25,404
- This is on card?
- Yes.

55
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:27,206
You are lying.

56
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,108
Yes.

57
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:32,711
Remind me never to be a spy with Han.

58
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:35,881
So this is how you tell
me what you think of me?

59
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:38,717
You hide behind outdated
method of feedback?

60
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:43,756
What, I should've posted
twitpic of my face like this?

61
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:49,061
Maybe I will send you a
twitpic of my meatloaf.

62
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:51,296
Can you twits pick
another time to do this?

63
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,664
I've gotta go home.

64
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:54,299
I have to go home too...

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,769
And cut the remaining sleeves
off of all my shirts.

66
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,203
And then go buy more shirts.

67
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:00,339
And cut the sleeves off those shirts.

68
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,673
You must wear sleeves.

69
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:03,108
Do not tell me what to do.

70
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,310
I was working here when you
were still a dumpling.

71
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:08,714
On your father's chopstick.

72
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:12,518
Now this is starting to
sound like earl time.

73
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:23,513
- Did it light?
- No.

74
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:25,749
Try another one. The gas is on.

75
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,819
Ah!

76
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,054
Why are we throwing fire at an oven?

77
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,856
Is this a poor people game?

78
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:34,791
Yeah, it's called light
the broken pilot light.

79
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,727
Without blowing our faces off!

80
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:39,129
This is ridiculous.
My heart is pounding.

81
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,832
I didn't know baking cupcakes
was an extreme sport.

82
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,969
It's like the deadliest batch.

83
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,504
See? A slight hint of gas in the air.

84
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:50,274
Makes everything funnier.

85
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,576
Now there's too much gas.

86
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:54,011
If we threw a math in there now,

87
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:55,779
I'd be out a nose or a pair
or a pair of eyebrows.

88
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,381
And I'm not living through that again.

89
00:03:57,382 --> 00:03:59,049
Again?

90
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,417
When I was a little girl,

91
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:01,818
I was trying to make
a hungry man dinner.

92
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,287
And I lit the pilot light
too soon and whoosh!

93
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:05,055
No eyebrows.

94
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,090
Had to draw them on in magic marker.

95
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:12,429
Only mexican girls would talk to me.

96
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,997
Max, we have a cupcake business.

97
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:16,266
We have to tell the landlord
we need a new oven.

98
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,368
We can't ask the
landlord for a new oven.

99
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:21,071
Then he'll ask us stuff
like "who are you?

100
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:22,139
"why is your name not on the lease,

101
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,007
And where's the rent?"

102
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:25,575
Well, I'll buy us one.

103
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:28,378
Really?
You're gonna buy us a whole oven?

104
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:33,317
We're so poor I have a sock that
I refer to as my good sock.

105
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:36,219
I've been saving something
for an emergency,

106
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,924
Like a burst appendix or
a first date bikini wax.

107
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,359
I knew it!

108
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,294
You have a secret stash of your
father's missing billions.

109
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:45,529
We're rich!

110
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,763
Wait, it's other people's money.

111
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:49,066
Yeah, but I didn't steal it. We're rich!

112
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,435
They're my expensive rings.

113
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:53,036
So if these are your expensive rings,

114
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:54,638
What's all that other stuff you wear?

115
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,906
Cheaper copies.

116
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:57,774
You never wear the good
stuff out in public.

117
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:00,243
Got it, kind of like hiding
the banana republic.

118
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,112
And wearing the gap.

119
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,714
See how special?

120
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:06,750
They're all one-of-a-kind
from thomas aristotle thomas.

121
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:08,285
T-a-t. Tat.

122
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,453
What?

123
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:12,022
Tat rings.
You've never heard of tat rings?

124
00:05:12,023 --> 00:05:16,426
Oh! Tat rings. No.

125
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:17,594
I guess it's the kind of thing.

126
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:19,396
That only people in the
know know, you know?

127
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:20,664
No.

128
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:21,798
Make all the jokes you want,

129
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,233
But I only have to sell one of these.

130
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:24,534
And I can get us a new oven.

131
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:26,370
Any ideas what kind we should get?

132
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:31,274
Uh, yeah, you're not the only
one with a secret stash.

133
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:34,311
It's the Bluestar.

134
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:36,246
It's the tat rings of ovens.

135
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,281
In purple!

136
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:40,384
That's right, I said purple.

137
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:42,953
It's the muscle car of ovens.
It's bad-ass!

138
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:44,955
It's so bad-ass when I do karaoke

139
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:50,227
I change the lyrics from
purple rain to purple range.

140
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,996
Great, we'll get this one.

141
00:05:52,997 --> 00:05:54,598
Uh, we can't buy that.
It's too expensive.

142
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,433
This is just something
you fantasize about.

143
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:57,968
It's kitchen porn.

144
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,569
Fine.

145
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,238
Tomorrow we'll go to the
cash for gold store.

146
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:05,275
And get a regular oven and get cookin'.

147
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:08,412
I think the funny gas is gone.

148
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,047
Must be time. I'm going in.

149
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:13,450
Let me do it, my eyebrows
need to waxed anyway.

150
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:18,722
Hurry up! The gas is on!
Throw the match in!

151
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:23,226
- Did it light?
- No, but my foot is on fire.

152
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:26,830
I'll do it.

153
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:37,874
You're good.

154
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:44,614
I'm sorry, but how much
longer do we have to wait.

155
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:45,882
To get cash for our gold?

156
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:47,551
I told you before I'm on the phone.

157
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:49,819
Sit down, shut up, don't be rude.

158
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,088
I thought she'd be nicer
from her picture.

159
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:54,758
On the bus stop bench.

160
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,460
Yeah, and where are the dollar signs?

161
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,663
Let me see, which ring should I sell?

162
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:01,565
So much history in my lap.

163
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:05,268
I don't even wanna tell you
about the history in my lap.

164
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,637
My father got me this one in london.

165
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:09,806
I got this one in paris
to reward myself.

166
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,441
For not crying during the turbulence.

167
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,743
On the flight to paris.

168
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:17,547
My mom got me a fresca when
she hit me with her car once.

169
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:19,549
I got this one when I was 18.

170
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,551
It was my very first tat. Okay, stop!

171
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:23,920
This was a bad idea.
Let's get out of here.

172
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,855
I told you before. I'm on the phone!

173
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:30,260
Sit down, shut up, don't be rude.

174
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,795
I'm only sitting down because look.

175
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:34,431
She has her hand on a gun that's
strapped under the counter.

176
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:36,666
She is dying to plug us.

177
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,968
Max, what are you talking about?

178
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:39,669
Why is this a bad idea?

179
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,373
I don't want you sacrificing
your precious rings, frodo.

180
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:44,674
Because if the business
doesn't work out,

181
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:46,276
It'll be my fault you have nothing.

182
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:47,577
And call me selfish,

183
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:50,313
The only life I wanna ruin is my own.

184
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:52,282
Max, the business will go up and down.

185
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,750
That's natural.

186
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:56,486
But this ring is about more than
the day to day of the business.

187
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:59,522
It's about us...
And our future together.

188
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:02,926
Yo, did you just ask me to marry you?

189
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:06,129
You could do worse.

190
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,798
Now, ladies, gold. Now.

191
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:11,001
Come on. It's only one ring.

192
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:13,803
And when it comes to us, I'm
in this for the long haul.

193
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:16,573
Or until this lady shoots us.

194
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:18,575
- Hi, I'm here to...
- come on! Let's go.

195
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:23,179
Don't push me I'm out of nicorette.

196
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,215
Well, you're all business, aren't you?

197
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:26,783
I can respect that.

198
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:28,218
I'd like to exchange a tat ring.

199
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:30,954
I've never heard of a tat ring.

200
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:33,456
Thomas aristotle thomas?

201
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:34,958
World-famous designer?

202
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,429
Yeah, talk down to me.
That'll make the price better.

203
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,865
All right, I'll weight it.

204
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:43,266
What's that smell?

205
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:44,734
Is someone making soup in the back?

206
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:47,003
None of your business.

207
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:50,840
I will give you $275.

208
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,942
It's worth $2,500.

209
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:56,012
Where? In 2005?

210
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,814
You're just taking advantage of people.

211
00:08:57,815 --> 00:08:59,482
Because the world economy is crashing.

212
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:06,523
It's called cash for gold, not
sympathy for flat chicks.

213
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:08,692
You know what? This is inappropriate.

214
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,694
All right, I'd like to see
your business license.

215
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,696
Maybe I'll make a call to
the chamber of commerce.

216
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:16,800
- Oh, you will, huh?
- Duck! Here comes the gun!

217
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,836
Maybe I'll make a call
to my boys in the back.

218
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:24,908
Sal! Richard!

219
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:27,911
Oh, hello. Let's get out of here.

220
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:33,016
Are you sure?
Because I'm kinda feeling richard.

221
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:37,821
Max, I was just in the ladies' room.

222
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,289
And I had a thought.

223
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,226
Why am I doing my lipstick in a
mirror that says "die carlos""

224
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:44,728
I know how to get the
full value of the ring.

225
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,696
We just have to take it to the
store where they sell it,

226
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:48,064
And return it.

227
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,033
Uh, and why didn't that
occur to you before?

228
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:51,234
'cause I don't have the receipt.

229
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:52,569
And I bought it three years ago...

230
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,039
From another store...
In another country.

231
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:02,679
The customer asked for crust
off of a turkey club.

232
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,348
Did they say that or is
this something you say.

233
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:06,850
That they said?

234
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,184
They said it.

235
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:10,653
But I say I see "screw the
bos"" sleeveless tee.

236
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:12,756
I'm sorry, someone call Ripley's.

237
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:17,293
There is a small mouse speaking.

238
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:19,462
And I bet for sure it comes
with stinky armpits.

239
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:24,434
Why don't you see for
yourself, ratatouille?

240
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,202
I've gotta go. Fight's starting.

241
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:30,140
You are stinky.

242
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:32,075
So stinky my mother in
Korea called me and said,

243
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,411
"What is that smell?"

244
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:37,213
I am surprised you're
upset by man smell.

245
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:40,650
Most women like you enjoy it.

246
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:43,620
Yo, Max, I got 20 bucks on Han.

247
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:46,122
He's scrappy.

248
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,524
Your english is terrible.

249
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,993
My english is less terrible
than your terrible english.

250
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:52,629
What? I couldn't understand
a word you said.

251
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,532
What? So sorry I couldn't
understand a word you said.

252
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,368
- Excuse me, regular-sized people.

253
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:03,440
I am on break until he apologizes.

254
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:04,707
I think the round's over.

255
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,810
I couldn't understand a word they said.

256
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:08,878
He needs to apologize. I'm the boss.

257
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,681
Don't let him get to you, Han.

258
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:15,618
Every woman knows size doesn't matter.

259
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,192
I like your shirt.

260
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,761
Reminds me of the side of the
van I lost my virginity in.

261
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:27,864
That little man disrespect me.

262
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:33,770
He insult my food, my
english, my "hyjane."

263
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:36,139
Is there anything I can
do to cheer you up?

264
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,209
A hug would help.

265
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,411
If I hug you, will you go back to work?

266
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:44,414
Yes.

267
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,816
- Two-second hug. I'm going in.

268
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,820
Aww.

269
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,327
How did you do that?
Your hands never left my back.

270
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:00,463
I am david blaine of zippers.

271
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,999
I was trying to cheer you up.

272
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,369
You did.

273
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,607
Wow, it's so surreal being back here.

274
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,575
I grew up here. It was like camp for me.

275
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:14,677
I learned who all the
best designers were,

276
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:18,448
How to color coordinate,
how to ride a bike.

277
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,583
They let you ride a bike here?

278
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:25,522
Bitch, I owned this piece.

279
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:26,890
If there's not an iguana in here,

280
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:29,325
This place is stupid.

281
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:31,895
Oh, my god.

282
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:34,163
They are such gorgeous tat rings.

283
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:37,100
- Thanks!
- Hate you! So jealous!

284
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:41,771
- Thanks!
- Bye!

285
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:46,175
Seeing you in your natural
habitat is truly disturbing.

286
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:47,644
Hi! Can I help you?

287
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:50,713
Hi! I'd like to return a ring
I got as a present here.

288
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:52,448
Tat rings are so amazing.

289
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:53,883
I can't believe you want to return it.

290
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:56,519
Well, this one's from a
guy I'm no longer with,

291
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,221
So it's painful to even look at.

292
00:12:58,222 --> 00:12:59,489
I understand.

293
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,724
But I couldn't take it
back without a receipt.

294
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:03,326
The thing is he used to hit her.

295
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:05,161
Max! You did not!

296
00:13:05,162 --> 00:13:07,430
Caroline, it's not your fault.

297
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:09,566
That's awful.

298
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,568
I understand why you
wouldn't want this ring.

299
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:12,936
I'm sure there's something I can do.

300
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:18,207
It's not our fault. I mean...Your fault.

301
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:24,814
Caroline Channing?

302
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:25,848
Jeffrey!

303
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:28,318
Surprised to see me working here?

304
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:30,286
Well, I got fired from that other store.

305
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:32,055
Whose name I will never mention again.

306
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,390
After last year's
cigarette butt incident.

307
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:35,858
I'm so sorry.

308
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:38,494
I had no idea those menthol
slim 100s were yours.

309
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:40,229
I just thought so many
butts on the ground.

310
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,599
Outside the store was gross,
so I said something.

311
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,201
Well, that one comment from
the great Caroline Channing.

312
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:48,504
About those butts fired my little butt.

313
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:50,940
You'd be happy to know
that I quite smoking.

314
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:54,410
After you got me fired.
Couldn't afford it.

315
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:56,746
I also couldn't afford
my gym membership.

316
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,481
Which is why my fired
little butt got massive,

317
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:02,885
Why no one wanted to date me, and
why I spent gay pride alone.

318
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:05,555
Fortunately, I wound up working here.

319
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:09,225
Yeah, it all worked out.
Your butt looks tight.

320
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:11,194
It's halfway there.

321
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,663
So I got the price on the ring.

322
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:17,033
You're buying a ring? A tat ring?

323
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,635
Actually, I'm returning.

324
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:22,305
Oh, can I see the receipt?

325
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:27,076
As manager of the jewelry department,

326
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:29,812
I couldn't possibly return
a ring that you bought.

327
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:33,549
At least three years
ago without a receipt.

328
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,919
You wouldn't want me to lose
my job again, would you?

329
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,590
I got this, donna.

330
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:42,592
And so sorry to hear about
your father being a criminal.

331
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:45,161
And you being penniless
and all that ugliness.

332
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,496
But it is kinda karma.

333
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:49,432
You are where you are now,
and I'm back on top.

334
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,401
Look, jeffrey, I know we just met,

335
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:56,572
But there's no way you're a top.

336
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:02,812
Now what are we gonna do?

337
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,714
We should hunt down that
super fake jealous lady.

338
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,449
Who hates you.

339
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,750
Maybe she'll buy one.

340
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:09,552
Max, that's brilliant.

341
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,387
If anybody's gonna buy a tat ring,

342
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:13,122
They're already in the store.

343
00:15:13,123 --> 00:15:14,624
We can have a pop-up sale!

344
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,125
- A pop-up sale?

345
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:17,794
- You don't know what a pop-up sale is?

346
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:20,329
You didn't know what a pilot light was.

347
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,564
it's the new trend.

348
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:23,266
Mini stores pop up and sell stuff,

349
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,600
Then they're gone.

350
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:25,868
That's not a new trend.

351
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:29,205
Drug dealers have been
doing that for years.

352
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:32,341
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

353
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:34,343
What are you doing, beautiful mind?

354
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:36,379
I'm mentally scanning the
layout of the store.

355
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,747
For security cameras.

356
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:39,515
I knew coming here and not
going to parks as a child.

357
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:40,950
Would pay off.

358
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,785
Okay, there's only one place
we could pull it off.

359
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:44,087
Where there are no cameras.

360
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:45,555
Where?

361
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:48,691
- Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

362
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:50,860
That's right, ma'am!

363
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:53,362
I said pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

364
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:55,064
I don't do improv.

365
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,403
So did we sell the ring yet?

366
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:02,004
Those women weren't
our target customers.

367
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,407
We're looking for a very specific type.

368
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:07,009
Too much style and money to burn.

369
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,545
hold the elevator!

370
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,417
and I love new york!

371
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:17,286
Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

372
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,711
I'll take you in two at a time.

373
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:25,979
Let me go check with my associate.

374
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,849
And I'll be right back
for adin and lublubah.

375
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,117
Such a good memory.

376
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:34,687
Hard to forget such beautiful names.

377
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:35,788
Ready?

378
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:38,625
We have a pooper in stall two.

379
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:42,428
Who shops and plops? I mean, really.

380
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:46,599
- Trust me, I smell the match.
Classic shop and plop cover-up.

381
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,835
Where are the two Kit Kats we
got from the vending machine?

382
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:50,837
I told you I was hungry.

383
00:16:50,838 --> 00:16:53,239
Arabic women expect a gift
when they buy something.

384
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,407
Well, stall number two.

385
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:57,810
Will probably supply a little present.

386
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:59,379
- Hi, are you here for the pop-up sale?

387
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,914
- No, I just have to pee.
- Oh, geez.

388
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:03,249
Come on, don't waste my time!

389
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,184
One stall's open... in and out!
Running a business!

390
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:08,087
That woman pushed ahead of us.

391
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,422
Do not sell her my tat ring.

392
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:10,924
It's fun. You're here to pick up.

393
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:14,527
She's here to drop off.

394
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:16,930
Open the shop.

395
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:18,031
We're a good team.

396
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:19,499
You set 'em up, I knock 'em down.

397
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,369
- Why is?
- I don't know, it just is.

398
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,438
Are you here for the pop-up sale?

399
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,340
- A pop-sale in the bathroom?

400
00:17:27,341 --> 00:17:29,575
So lame. So lame.

401
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,844
Caroline? Jen, Robin!

402
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,146
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

403
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:35,848
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god.

404
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:39,052
- Excuse me.
When will pop-up sale start?

405
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:42,989
We have lunch reservations for
five at Four Seasons at 3:00.

406
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,824
Why are you asking me?

407
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:47,527
- You two are doing pop-up sale, no?

408
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:49,028
No.

409
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:52,432
I have nothing to do with this
pop-up sale in the bathroom.

410
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:53,800
- So lame.
- So lame.

411
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:55,034
So lame!

412
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,369
So lame.

413
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,637
Come to lunch with us.

414
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:58,671
Oh, I've already eaten.

415
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,340
Our treat.

416
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:01,474
We are not taking no for an answer.

417
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:02,942
They're not taking no for an answer.

418
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:04,210
Sell the ring.

419
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:07,580
Where is she going?
I thought you two were a team.

420
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:10,550
Apparently not.

421
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:13,920
So sorry.

422
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:16,689
I got caught up in a
hostage nicoise situation.

423
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,690
How'd it go?

424
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:18,891
Did you get full price for the ring?

425
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:21,627
Oh, do you know me?

426
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,796
Because I could've sworn
you didn't know me.

427
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:26,833
My new friends Adin and Lablueballs.

428
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,234
Thought it was weird that
you just bailed on me.

429
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,370
Max, I panicked in the moment.

430
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:31,871
I didn't want those
girls telling everyone

431
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:34,841
that Caroline Channing was in a
bathroom selling her jewelry.

432
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:37,443
I'm barely back on my feet
after the whole scandal.

433
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:41,447
I just couldn't bare it.

434
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:43,116
Here.

435
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:44,584
I didn't sell them because
I didn't buy the whole

436
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:47,053
"in it for the long haul"
thing from the beginning.

437
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:48,788
And I was right because
I'm always right.

438
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:50,957
About people in the long haul.

439
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,658
Max, I'm talking to you.

440
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:54,727
It's cool. We don't need to talk.

441
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:01,501
Max, about the rings, I'm sorry.

442
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:02,735
I don't know what else to say.

443
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:04,237
You don't need to say anything.

444
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:06,272
You already said a lot of words
about the future and us,

445
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:09,075
And then next thing I know,
you were "oh, my god!"

446
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:10,910
Off to lunch with your friends.

447
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:12,812
Max, I am in this for the long haul.

448
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:14,714
Isn't there anything I can
say to convince you of that?

449
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:16,883
Nope. And it's fine.

450
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,384
It's not you, it's me.

451
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:19,652
I'm the idiot who actually
believed for a minute.

452
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:20,820
That we had a future.

453
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:22,288
But it's okay.

454
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:24,657
We'll just keep getting by like
we are, for the short haul.

455
00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:26,225
Cool?

456
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,895
Max.

457
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:38,304
Hey! Hey.

458
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:41,307
What's that smell? I'm making cupcakes.

459
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:45,478
- You lit the pilot light?
- Didn't have to. Look.

460
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:50,883
No way! The Bluestar in purple?

461
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,185
What the... how did it get...

462
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,087
How can... how could you afford that?

463
00:19:54,088 --> 00:19:56,122
You sold your tat? Sold them all.

464
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:59,158
Spent it on the oven, next-day
delivery fee and installation.

465
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,760
That woman gave you a better price?

466
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,995
No, she pulled a gun on me.

467
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,530
So I went to every gold
store in Brooklyn,

468
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:06,232
leveraged their offers
against each other

469
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,201
until I got enough to buy the Bluestar.

470
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:10,303
You didn't have to do that.

471
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:12,972
After what I did, there
were no more words.

472
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:14,440
Only ovens.

473
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:17,176
And our future means more to
me than rings from my past.

474
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:20,646
I told you, I'm in this
for the long haul.

475
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:24,717
For the record, I hated
lunch with those girls.

476
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:28,387
I'd rather split a Kit Kat in
a bathroom with you any day.

477
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:30,022
I'm sorry I wasn't listening.

478
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:32,859
I was staring at my new
boyfriend over there.

479
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,661
I wanna make out with it!

480
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:38,664
Ooh. Ow! Hot!

481
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:42,001
There's not a ding!

482
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:45,972
There's a ding. My rings bought a ding.

483
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:48,074
You wanna hug me, don't you?

484
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:50,309
Yeah.

485
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,012
- But you're not gonna.
- Yes, I am.

486
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:57,550
If you unzip my shirt,
I'm gonna be pissed!

487
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:59,952
Impressed, but pissed.
