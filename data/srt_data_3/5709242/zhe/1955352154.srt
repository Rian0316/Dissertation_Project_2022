是啊  要就冒險而言
Yeah, well, I'm afraid Britain's pretty tame

She's worried. You're her son. You've been travelling,

120
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,790
我覺得如果你和她說上幾句  那...

121
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,430
我現在還跟她住在一起  在錫拉丘茲

- Oh, my God. I'm sorry. - Last year. No, it's okay.

127
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,600
我們早知道快了  是早發性阿爾茨海默氏癥
It was coming for a while. It was early onset Alzheimer's.

128
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,270
那肯定很...難熬
Oh, that must have been really... uh... tough.

129
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,480
是啊  他是我最好的朋友
Yeah, he was my best friend.

130
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,750
有時候他看著我  都認不出我是誰了
Sometimes he'd just look at me and wouldn't even know who I was.

131
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,840
我媽媽  我甚至都...
Well, my mum, like, I don't even...

132
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,410
我不知道該怎么和她說話了
I don't know how to talk to her.

133
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
我跟她沒有那么親密
You know, I don't have that connection.

134
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,770
我都不知道從什么聊起
I don't even know where to start.

135
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,750
所以我才離開  所以我才開始這趟旅行
So that's why I left. That's why I went on this trip.

136
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,220
只是想暫時逃離
Just to get away

137
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,680
盡量多制造一些回憶
and make, you know, all the memories that I can...

138
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,720
趁我還有能力
while I can.

139
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,000
我知道我終究要跟她說話  我得...
And I know I gotta talk to her and I gotta just...

140
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,340
但不要這樣談  我只是...
But not on this. You know, I just--

141
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,870
我會處理的
I'll deal with it.

142
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,990
等我回去后會處理的  我會...
I'll deal with it when I get back, you know. I'll just...

你是個好人  庫珀
You're a good guy, Cooper.

144
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,700
給你媽媽打電話吧
Call your mum.

145
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,140

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,040
不  我昨晚沒有在蘇梅島買涼鞋
No, I did not buy a pair of sandals in Koh Samui last night

148
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,350
因為我在...
because I'm in--

149
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,090
這要花多久
And how long...and how long does that take?

150
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,930
因為我現在要買機票回美國
Because I need to buy a ticket back to America.

151
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,070
天啊
Oh, my God.

155
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,610
我要說  這二次約炮的企圖
Can I just say, this is the most blatant cover story

156
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,250
也太明顯了
for a second hook-up ever?

157
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,420
太好了  天啊  謝謝你  謝謝  謝謝
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,200
包  沒錯  我的包
The bag, yep, my bag. Alright.

160
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,950
你是個好姑娘
You are a top bird.

161
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,880
我根本不知道那是什么意思
I don't know what that means,

162
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,690
但我聽別人說過  你就是
but I heard somebody say it once, and you're it.

163
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,490
我有個計劃
I got a plan.

164
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,780
打一些零工
Yeah. It's odd jobs.

165
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,520
-給誰打  -給一個應用
- For who? - For, like, it's an app.

166
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,260
你能  就...
You can kind of-- like...

167
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,750
我沒錢的時候經常用這個  所以...
I've used it all over when funds were low, so...

168
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,700
-的確有些有意思的活兒  -挺不錯的
- Oh, there's some interesting ones. - Pretty cool.

169
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,300
"招募尋求刺激者"
"Thrillseekers wanted."

170
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,530
-這看上去很合你的胃口  -好吧
- This looks right up your street. - Okay.

171
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,440
好吧  酬勞四星  是個大單子  不錯
Okay, four pound signs. That's a biggie. That's good.

172
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,570
{\an8}招募尋求刺激者
齋藤游戲團隊
英國  伯克郡

173
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,060
離市中心有點遠
It's a little out of town.

174
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,920
是某種游戲測試  給一個叫齋藤...
And some kind of play test deal for a company called Saitoo...

175
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,440

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,840
-真的很大  -真的嗎
- They're really big. - Really?

179
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,120
恐怖游戲
Horror games?

180
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,790
你聽說過...
Have you heard of...

181
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,370
哪個是他們出的來著
oh, what's one of theirs?

182
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,120
《哈萊克魅影》
Harlech Shadow.

183
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,340
《哈萊克魅影》  聽說過
Harlech Shadow? Yes, I have.

184
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,750
我大概七年級的時候在我哥們路德維格的
I used to play that in my buddy David Ludwig's basement

186
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,660
地下室里玩過
when we were, like, seventh grade.

185
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,150
{\an8}齋藤翔  懼怕他

187
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,460
那就是齋藤翔  是他的公司
Well, that's Shou Saito. It's his company.

188
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,160
-他是個天才  超級神秘  -好吧
- He's like this genius, super secretive. - Okay.

189
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,320
他們在研究一個新項目
And apparently, they're working on this new project.

190
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,240
投了好大一筆錢  前所未有的突破
Big money involved. Groundbreaking.

191
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,850
但沒人知道具體是什么
But nobody knows anything about it.

192
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,310
要是我做得夠好
Well, maybe if I play my cards right

193
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,940
說不定能給你搞到翔的獨家新聞
I can get you an exclusive with Shou.

194
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,770
《翔記》  怎么樣
Fo Shou? Yeah?

195
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,050
你應該拍張照
You should take a photo.

196
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,470
說真的  要是你能拍到
Seriously, if you get a photo of

197
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,200
他們正在研究的任何東西
anything that they're working on,

198
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,070
賺的錢可比四星酬勞多多了
that's a fuckload more money than four pound signs.

199
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,660
好吧
Cool.

200
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,600
這地方到底在哪里
Well, where is this place?

201
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,740
科珀先生
Mr. Copper.

202
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,630
叫我庫珀就行
Just Cooper.

203
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,760
庫珀先生  對不起
Mr. Cooper, I apologize.

204
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,010
就叫我庫珀吧
Just Cooper is fine.

205
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,840

206
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,540
既然如此  叫我凱蒂就行了
Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

207
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,180
-跟我來  -好
- Follow me. - Oh, yeah.

208
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,600
-我拿一下我的行李  -拉弗會處理好的

209
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,360
拉弗會處理  那好吧
Oh, Rav will take care of that. Okay, great.

210
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,170
好吧  我反正也不想背了
That's good. I don't wanna carry it anyway.

211
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,310
拉弗看上去像最終關卡里的首領怪
Rav kind of reminds me of like an end-of-level boss.

212
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,210
元氣功
You know, haiukon. Just...

213
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,700

- The car pick you up okay? - Yeah.

215
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,290
這邊走
This way.

216
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,530
他們...看得到嗎
Are they... seeing?

217
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,240
真厲害  很厲害
It's cool. Very cool.

218
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,280
過來吧
Come on.

219
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,700
感覺我就要見鄧布利多了
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.

220
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,530
希望能分到格蘭芬多
Hope I get Gryffindor.

221
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,720
我要拿走你的電話
I'm gonna need your phone

222
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,390
以及其他能發送和接受訊號的工具
and anything else you might use to send and receive.

223
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,860
-有點疑神疑鬼了吧  -小心駛得萬年船
- A little paranoid, don't you think? - Can't be too careful.

224
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,070
好吧  給你
Okay, there you go.

225
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,580
你還真是疑神疑鬼
Wow, you really are paranoid.

226
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,310
還真白
It's white.

227
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,750
{\an8}齋藤游戲

228
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,400
我猜這上面是說
Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,

229
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,690
我同意被采集腎臟嗎
I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

230
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,400
其實是標準保密協議和免責聲明之類的
Actually, it's a pretty standard NDA-disclaimer thing.

231
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,380
好吧
Okay.

232
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,910
重要的是要告訴你
It's important that you realize

233
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,350
我們需要做個小手術
there is a small medical procedure involved.

234
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,060
抱歉  為了測試游戲嗎
Sorry, for a game?

235
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,700
沒有永久性后遺癥  我們也不會取走你的腎
Nothing permanent and we don't harvest your kidneys,

236
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,230
-我保證  好吧
- I promise. - Okay.

237
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,320
比打耳洞造成的傷害都要小
It's no more invasive than having your ears pierced.

238
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,740
"機密信息
"Confidential information,

239
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,700

The signature page...

241
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,260
我簽在哪里
Where do I sign?

242
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,580
-要簽名  -少了一頁
- Signature. Yeah. - There's a page missing.

243
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,880
-好吧  -稍等
- Okay. - Just a moment.

244
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,820
好吧  我就等...在這里
Alright. I'll just wait... here.

245
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,630
什么東西
What the fuck?

246
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,140
{\an8}索尼婭
-顯然還要動手術  -搞什么

247
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,010
-沒事吧  -沒事
- All good? - All good.

248
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,670
我們研究的是一種交互式增強現實系統
What we're working on is an interactive augmented reality system.

249
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,430
-就像虛擬現實  -是加在現實之上的層次
- Like VR? - More like layers on top of reality.

250
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,660
好吧
Okay.

251
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,480
-那是什么  -我們叫這個蘑菇
- What's that? - We call this a mushroom.

252
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,530
-像《馬里奧兄弟》里的  -可以這么說
- Like Mario Brothers? - If you like.

253
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,580
你有相應的資質吧
You're qualified to do this, right?

254
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,220
到現在為止我還沒殺過人
I haven't killed anyone yet.

255
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,670
行嗎
May I?

256
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,030
好
Yeah.

257
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,730
好了
All done.

258
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,750
-就這樣  -我跟你說了我很厲害
- That was it? - See, I told you I'm good.

259
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,070
不  別擔心  這不是永久性的
No, don't worry, it's not permanent.

260
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,600
好吧  這是什么
Okay. What is this, like,

261
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,130
某種記憶測試之類的嗎
some kind of memory test or something like that?

262
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,620
-到時候就知道了  -好吧
- You'll find out. - Oh, okay.

263
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,420
剛啟動的時候你可能會有輕微的刺痛感
You might feel a slight twinge as it initializes.

264
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,430
好吧
Oh, okay.

265
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,250
5點38分開始
Commencing at 5:38.

266
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,620
-你準備好了嗎  -準備好了  長官
- You ready? - Yes, sir!

267
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,070
快好了
Nearly there.

268
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,570
{\an8}媽媽
來電

269
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,040
我以為我關掉了
I thought I turned that off.

270
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,180
完成了  你感覺還好吧
All done. You feel okay?

271
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,230
好極了
Feel great.

272

-看這些圓墊  -好的
- Watch the targets. - Okay.

273
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,330
這...
Is--

274
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,820
你看到了什么
What do you see?

275
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,060
像...
Like a-- um--

276
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,120
像一個電子游戲里的地鼠
Like a video game gopher.

277
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,200
-現在是不是更細膩了  -是的
- Is it more detailed now? - Yeah.

278
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,060
沒錯
Yep, yeah.

279
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,900
-現在呢  -我操
- And now? - Holy fuck!

280
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,750
操  它就在...
Holy shit! He-- Fuck. He's right--

281
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,300
它就在...我能...
He's right-- He's right-- Can I--

282
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,170
它不是真的  只是種意識投影
He's not real. He's a sort of mental projection.

283
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,010
-你看得到它  我看不到  -你看不到
- You can see him. I can't. - You can't?

284
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,720
打它一下
Give him a whack.

285
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,670
打它一下  那好吧
Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright.

286
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,360
好吧  就像打地鼠一樣
Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole.

287
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,080
我玩過好多次了  好
I've played it a million times. Okay.

288
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,310

開始吧  來吧
Here we go. Come on up.

290
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,800
你要從哪里出來
Where you coming up?

297
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,310
-就這樣嗎  -恐怕是的
- Is that it? - Afraid so.

298
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,770
這些地鼠是二維的還是三維的
Now, were the gophers two-dimensional or three?

299
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,900
三維  不不不  超級三維  就像...
Three. No, no, no. 3D, super 3D. Like-- Yeah.

300
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,790
-這只是部分測試演示  -剛剛只是演示
- Now this is just a limited test demo. - That was a demo?

301
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,110
我覺得你應該進一步
I think you should beta test

302
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,180
測試我們研究的完整體驗
the full experience we're working on.

303
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,980
當然了如果你愿意玩  會給你更多錢
There'd be more money in it, of course. If you're game?

304
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,160
我玩  我玩
I'm game. I'm game.

305
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,620
這位是齋藤翔
This is Shou Saito.

306
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,190
你是新來的志愿測試者吧
You must be our latest volunteer.

307
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,440
這真是太棒了
This is really great.

308
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,980
我想說那個地鼠游戲  超有趣
I just-- I wanted to say that the mole game, super fun.

309
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,750
超有趣  有趣
Super fun... fun.

310
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,250
-有趣  -有趣
- Fun? - Fun.

311
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,570
有趣是好事
Fun is good.

312
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,880
玩游戲很好
Playing games is good.

313
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,520
你的心跳加快
Your heart goes faster.

314
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,210
-你會笑  -是啊
- You smile. - Yeah.

315
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,780
是啊  或者  尖叫
Yeah. Or, um... scream.

316
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,690
{\an8}《哈萊克魅影》

317
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,980
我一直很喜歡讓玩家跳起來
I have always liked to make the player jump.

318
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,140
驚嚇  你一害怕就會嚇跳起來
Frightened. You get scared, you jump.

319
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,450
-之后  你會感覺很棒  -沒錯
- Afterwards, you feel good. - Yeah.

320
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,650
你會容光煥發
You glow.

321
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,350
為什么呢
Why?

322
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,980
因為腎上腺素的激增
Because of the adrenaline rush.

323
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,880
-沒錯  -是啊
- Yes. - Yeah.

324
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,010
但主要是因為你還活著
But mostly because you are still alive.

325
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,100
你在安全的環境里直面了最深刻的恐懼
You have faced your greatest fears in a safe environment.

326
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,810
這是恐懼的釋放  讓你解放了
It is a release of fear. It liberates you.

327
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,150
是啊  說得太對了
Yeah. I mean, totally.

328
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,040
我們現在研究的
What we are working on now

329
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,790
是有史以來最個人化的恐怖生存游戲
is the most personal survival horror game in history.

330
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,240
厲害
Cool.

331
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,400
利用你自己的思維來嚇你
One that works out how to scare you by using your own mind.

332
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,930
那...聽上去很瘋狂
That-- That sounds crazy.

333
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,220
迫不及待了
Can't wait!

334
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,150
我在上傳神經網絡軟件包
I'm uploading a neural net package.

335
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,410
神經網絡軟件包  神經網絡
Neural net packing, neural net.

336
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,220
你們應該再改進下名字  這名字太過時了
Name could use a little work, I think. It's all 90s.

337
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,260
我開玩笑的  名字不錯
I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

338
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,080
這是最尖端的智能軟件
It's state of the art intelligence software.

339
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,890
它會在運行過程中學習和適應
It learns and adapts on the fly.

340
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,180
它會監控你的腦活動
It'll monitor your brain activity

341
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,600
推斷出最能嚇到你的方式
and try and work out how best to frighten you

342
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
然后根據你的體驗進行調整
and then adjust to your experience accordingly.

343
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,370
-你準備好了嗎  -好了
- Are you ready? - Oh, yeah.

344
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,540
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《星際迷航》梗

345
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,540
傳送我吧  開始吧  準備發射
Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.

346
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,670

How are you feeling?

350
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,520
很好  一切正常
I feel good. I feel normal.

351
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,060
好  慢慢站起來
Okay. Stand up, slowly.

352
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,640
你準備好玩游戲了嗎
Are you ready to play?

353
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,600
這不是《哈萊克魅影》的宅子嗎
Isn't this the Harlech Shadow house?

354
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,310
是莊園的一部分
It's part of the estate.

355
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,800
其實是守門人的小屋  但這就是原型
The gamekeeper's lodge, actually. But, yeah, this was the model.

356
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,470
我們為游戲復刻了陳設  掃描了結構
The layout was replicated for the game and the texture scanned.

357
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,230
實在是太酷了
Very, very cool.

358
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,070
游戲怎么玩  我該做什么
So what's the game, what do I do?

359
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,670
你什么都不用做
You don't have to do anything.

360
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,380
你只需獨自待在這里
You just stay in here alone,

361
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,480
看你在害怕得撐不下去之前能堅持多久
see how long you last until you're too scared to continue.

362
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,630
我只需要待在這里
So all I have to do is, like, stay here?

363
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,780
然后就能拿到報酬
And I get paid for that?

364
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,390
我會在控制室里觀察你
I'll be back in the control room, watching.

365
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,010
到處都是攝像頭  不準偷東西哦
There are cameras all over, so no stealing the silverware.

366
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,870
還有這個
And now there's this.

367
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,920
-好  這是什么  -是耳機
- Ok. And what's this? - It's an earpiece.

368
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,190
放進耳朵里
Yeah, just pop it in,

369
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,180
這樣我們就能隨時聯系了
and you and I will be in contact the whole time.

370
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,310
真酷
Oh, cool.

371
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,750
-要是我跟你說話  你就能聽見  -對
- And I can, like, talk to you, and you'll hear it? - Right.

372
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,510
真棒
Great, great, that's great.

373
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,970
你看到的東西都無法真正傷害你
Now, nothing you'll see can physically harm you.

374
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,330
都是視聽虛擬的  就像打地鼠一樣
It's all just audio-visual, like the gopher game.

375
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,360
好的
Oh, okay.

376
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,450
但如果太過激烈  我們可以隨時把你撤出來
But if it does get too intense, we can pull you out at any time

377
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,800
-叫停實驗  -好
- and stop the experiment. - Okay.

378
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,600
你能想到什么安全詞嗎
Is there a safe word you can think of?

379
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,890
遇險時容易想起來的詞
Something easy to remember in distress?

380
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,530
"停"這個詞怎么樣
How about the word "Stop"?

381
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,200
-選得好  就"停"了  -好
- Good choice. "Stop" it is. - Yeah.

382
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,590
好  就讓你獨自享受夜晚吧
Okay, we'll leave you to enjoy your evening.

383
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,950
-好  -我過會兒就會聯系你
- Alright. - You'll hear from me in a moment.

384
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,600
隨意點兒
Just make yourself at home.

385
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,380
好的  悠著點
Okay, all right. Well, take her easy.

386
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,860
哈萊克...魅影
Harlech... Shadow.

387
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,410
是真的嗎  是真的  它真的死了
Is this real? Yeah, it's real. That's real. It's really dead.

388
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,130
庫珀
Cooper.

389
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,880
-你能聽見嗎  -一清二楚
- Are you hearing me? - Loud and clear.

390
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,920
我看見你已經開始借酒壯膽了呢
Reaching for the Dutch courage already, I see.

391
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,930
-但那酒恐怕是不含酒精的  -真差勁
- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic. - Lame.

392
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,370
我們需要你頭腦清醒
Well, we need you with a clear head.

393
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,060
好吧  有道理  有道理
Okay. Fair point. Fair point.

394
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,420
這工藝真精良  真漂亮
This is high-quality craftsmanship. This is nice.

395
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,640
是啊  木工活兒很精致
Yeah. It's good woodwork.

396
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,200
-畫的就是這里  -觀察力滿分
- That's this place. - Full marks for observation.

397
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,740
好了
Alright, there we go.

398
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,910
-糟了  -怎么了
- Oh, shit. - What's up?

399
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,390
我剛才忘了我沒帶手機
I just forgot I don't have my phone.

400
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,450
我一直去拿它  忘了它不在兜里
I keep going for it, I forget it's not in my pocket.

401
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,530
而且這里沒有電視  所以...
And there's, uh... no TV here, so...

402
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,790
歡迎回到19世紀
Welcome to the 19th century.

403
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,810
沒有電視  沒有因特網  沒有無線網絡
No TV, no Internet, no Wi-Fi.

404
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,240
是啊  難怪人們會看到亂七八糟的東西
Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.

405
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,500
大概只是因為無聊透頂了吧
Probably were just bored out of their gourds.

406
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,670
這是解釋鬧鬼的主流理論
Well, that's the leading theory about ghost sightings.

407
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,090
大腦受刺激較少時  會產生幻覺
The mind plays tricks when less stimulated.

408
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,550
讓人分心的東西越少  人們就越常看見鬼
Fewer distractions, people saw more ghosts.

409
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,190
知道這個真是太好了
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

410
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,950
但他們有文學作品可讀
Well, they got literature, though.

411
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,490
{\an8}《鬼故事集》

412
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,340
真貼心
That's pretty sweet, right?

413
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,880
天啊
Oh, my God,

414
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,710
我都不記得上次看書是什么時候了
I can't remember the actual last time that I read a book.

415
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,340
{\an8}《烏鴉》

416
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,340
想想看  人們曾經故意去看書
To think people used to do this on purpose.

417
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,740
是啊  真是瘋了  何必呢
I know. Crazy. Why?

418
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,150
-我覺得我不該  -安靜  好嗎
- You know, I don't think I've-- - Shh, alright?

419
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,240
我得沉浸在這老式的活動中了  集中注意力
I need to get into some old-school shit here. Concentrate.

420
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,060
抱歉
Pardon me.

421
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,590
我想說  你剛剛心率加快了
Can I point out your heart rate just increased?

422
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,840
當然會了  因為這兒有只特大的蜘蛛
Yeah. Well, it should have cos there's a huge crazy spider.

423
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,390
你看見了一只蜘蛛
You see a spider?

424
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,010
-你看不見它  -看不見
- You don't-- you don't see that? - No.

425
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,500
別爬過來  別
Don't-- don't walk. Don't--

426
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,870
見鬼
Holy shit!

427
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,590
你這樣的壯漢竟然怕蜘蛛
Tough guy like you, scared of spiders.

428
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,110
我只是不喜歡它們
Yeah, I'm just not fond of them.

429
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,840
-你有蜘蛛恐懼癥所以才會嚇到  -天啊
- It's worked out you're an arachnophobe quickly. - My God.

430

他有點像喬西·彼得斯
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

463

-喬西·彼得斯  你是喬西·彼得斯  -什么

系統為了建構
The system could be mining

467
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,220
可能在挖掘你的部分記憶
some of your personal memories for texture.

468
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,040
喬西·彼得斯是你害怕的人嗎
Was Josh Peters someone you were scared of?

469
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,020
他是個惡霸  我不怕
He was a bully. I wasn't scared.

470
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,440
我不怕他  但他是個惡霸而且
I wasn't scared of him, but he was a bully and--

471
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,100
天啊  上幾節以色列格斗術課
Man! Take a couple of Krav Maga classes

472
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,060
我就準備好了
and I'd be ready.

473
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,470
就準備好了
I'd be ready!

474

破壞神
Kali ma!

475
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,390
我去喝點酒  再戰
I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.

476
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,230
我也想給你倒點  但你大概喝不了  所以
I'd offer you some, but I don't think you can drink it so...

477
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,700
過會兒見  彼得斯
Catch ya later, Peters.

478
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,090
這無酒精的酒真棒
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

479
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,190
我不是什么專家  但它很好喝
I'm not like a expert or anything, but it's kinda great.

480
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,180
我去法國的時候  在葡萄園待過
I was in France. I stayed at this, like, vineyard,

481
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,770
他們的一個踩葡萄節上有種酒
and they had this wine, like, grape-stomping festival.

482
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,670
那酒可真好喝  我確定
Now that, that wine was good. I know that.

483
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,850
你在東拉西扯
You're being discursive.

484
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,190
-什么是東拉西扯  -絮絮叨叨
- What is discursive? Discursive? - Talkative.

485
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,390
語無倫次
Rambling.

486
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,880
這是問題嗎
Is that a problem?

487
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,610
人們害怕時  話會變多
People sometimes talk more when they're afraid.

488
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,600
有助于補償恐懼
Helps compensate for the fear.

489
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,660
-同時也是掩飾  -是嗎
- Masks it, too. - Oh, yeah?

490
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,280
類似于你在深夜時打開電視
Similar to when you've got the TV on late at night.

491
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,890
聲音能讓你不那么孤獨
The voices make you feel less alone.

492
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,140
哪怕你確實是一個人
Even though you are alone.

493
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,660
你嚇不到我的  凱蒂
You aren't scaring me, Katie.

494
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,240
可惜了
Pity.

495
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,670
這里有冰箱嗎
Is there like a refrigerator here?

496
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,700
壁櫥里有些零食
There's some snacks in the cupboard.

497
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,620
好的  讓我瞧瞧
Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney...

498
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,240
找到了
Mo! Alright.

499
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,990
姜味脆餅
Okay, ginger snaps.

500
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,390
看看
Let's see.

501
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,580
這就可以
This'll do.

502
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,540
現在...
Now...

503
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,710
我關門的時候他肯定就在后面  是不是
He's gonna be right behind this door when I close it, isn't he?

504
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,370
對  就是這樣的
Yeah, that's how this works.

505
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,680
我就知道  突然嚇人已經過時了
Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old--

506
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,550
操
Fuck!

507
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,130
天啊
Oh, God.

508
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,850
-那他媽是什么  -你看見什么了
- What the hell is that? - What do you see?

509
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,080
見鬼
Holy shit!

510
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,250
一個該死的...
A fucking--

511
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,220
很難描述
Hard to explain.

512
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,510
是個大號的蜘蛛
It's like a huge-ass spider

513
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,350
有張臉  屌從嘴里伸出來
with a face and dicks coming out of his mouth.

514
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,370
是...
It's...

515
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,570
彼得斯  彼得斯在里面
Peters. Peters is inside.

516
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,550
像是彼得斯和蜘蛛的結合體
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.

517
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,940
凱蒂  這是你干的  還是我
Ah, Katie! Are you doing this, or is this fucking me?

518
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,080
全都是你
I think that's all you.

519
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,180
我真是被害慘了
I'm so fucked up!

520
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,450
天啊  操
God! Fuck!

521
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,770
見鬼  你真是太惡心了
Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

522
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,070
喂
Yeah--

523
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,230
抱歉  你能再說一遍嗎
Sorry, can you say again?

524
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,650
凱蒂  喂
Katie, hello?

525
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,780
該死  凱蒂
Damn it, Katie!

526
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,780
你再上線的時候  說句話就行
Whenever you come back online, just say the word.

527
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,050
我不害怕  就是...無聊而已
No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

528
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,440
是你們嗎
That you guys?

529
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,250
進來修耳機嗎  這主意還不錯
Coming to fix the earpiece? That's probably a good idea.

530
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,090
來了  來了
Yeah. Yeah.

531
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,340
操
Fuck it, man!

532
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,730
來吧
Come on!

533
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,050
你有危險
You're in danger.

534
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,390
索尼婭
Sonja?

535
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,850
這才像話  這真是太不可思議了
Now we're talking. Alright, this is incredible.

536
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:37,630
真是太了不起了  我服得五體投地
This-- very impressive. I am thoroughly impressed.

537
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,810
我真是...
I am--

538
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,740
你看上去太真了  你簡直和她一模一樣
You look so real. You're, like, just like her.

539
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,710
真的
I mean, wow.

540
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,040
不過  很可惜你不是
Except... you're just unfortunately not...

541
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,440
-庫珀  你在干什么  -等下  慢著
- Cooper, what are you doing? - Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

542
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,360
-庫珀  你有危險  -別說話  我得思考
- Cooper, you're in danger. - Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

543
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,030
你他媽太真了  你是真的  真的
You're fucking real. You are real. You're real.

544
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,570
-庫珀  你  -你是索尼婭  你真在這兒
- Cooper, you're in-- - You're Sonja. You're actually here.

545
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,560
-你真在這兒嗎  -我是真的  我在這兒
- Are you actually here right now? - I'm real. I'm actually here.

546
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,870
-天啊  -我們必須走
- God. - And we have to go.

547
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,150
-你必須聽我說  -你怎么來了
- You have to listen to me. - How are you here?

548
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,650
你記得你給我發的照片嗎
You know that photo that you sent me?

549
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,300
我四處調查  發現齋藤翔去年獲得了一項
I dug around and apparently Shou Saito took out a patent

550
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,670
電腦人腦接口專利
for a computer brain interface last year.

551
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,870
你怎么可能是真的  我不...
How are you real? I don't--

552
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,530
好吧  操  我不...
Okay, fuck. I don't--

553
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,870
他們帶你來的
They brought you here!

554
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,420
你是真的  是他們帶你來的
You are, you're real, and they brought you here,

555
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,500
他們是想耍我  想得美  想得美
and they're trying to fuck with me. Nice try, good try.

556
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,760
我懂了  這是測試的一部分
I get it. It's part of the test.

557
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,160
他的專利被直接拒絕了
His patent got rejected outright.

558
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,100
人們說它瘋狂又危險
They said it was insane, it was dangerous.

559
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,050
真的嗎  他們付給你多少錢
Really? How much are they paying you?

560
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,100
說真的  因為你現在演得太好了
Honestly. Cos you're killing it right now.

561
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,130
他們給你吃了什么嗎
Have they given you something?

562
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,200
抱歉  我還以為你是假的
Sorry, I thought you were fake.

563
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,980
但我現在知道你是真的了
But now I know you're real,

564
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,580
我這主人當得太差勁了
I'm being a really terrible host.

565
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,070
我有無酒精的酒  喝點酒心情可能會好起來
I got some non-alcoholic wine. Might put us in the mood.

566
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,040
庫珀  我想帶你...
Cooper, what I want to do is get you--

567
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,900
我們進廚房說
We'll talk about it in the kitchen.

568
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,650
-庫珀  -索尼婭  別緊張好嗎
- Cooper! - Sonja, relax, okay?

569
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,610
別鬧了  我知道  被我看穿了  別裝了
Give it up. I know, the jig's up, okay? Let it go.

570
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,310
庫珀  還有別的隱情
Look, Cooper, there's more.

571
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,000
去年一年就有五個人失蹤了
Five people have disappeared in the past year.

572
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,630
全都是旅客
All tourists,

573
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,980
都在那個破零工應用上注過冊
all registered with that stupid odd jobs app.

574
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,240
是嗎  天啊  太瘋狂啦
Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy.

575
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,600
不管他們在對你做什么  對你做了什么
Whatever they're doing to you, whatever they've done to you,

576
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,160
都很危險  我們必須馬上離開  庫珀
it's dangerous, and we really have to go now, Cooper.

577
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,810
好吧  好吧  那好
Okay, okay. Alright.

578
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,860
-如果你的說法是真的  -庫珀
- Well, if your story's true... - Cooper.

579
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,800
-那你是怎么找到我的  -什么
- then how'd you find me? - What?

580
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,030
你怎么知道我在哪
How'd you know where I am?

581
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,390
這是家游戲公司  我查了地址
It's a games company, I looked up the address.

582
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,900
真的嗎
Yeah, really?

583
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,540
不對  你是怎么找到這的  就這里
No, no, no, no. How'd you find me here? This place.

584
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,260
-我追蹤了你  -追蹤了我
- I tracked you. - You tracked me?

585
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,590
就通過"找朋友"功能查你手機的衛星定位
Yeah, with your GPS on your phone. Find My Friends.

586
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,960
"找朋友"
Find My Friends?

587
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,550
被你圓回來了  但他們帶走了我的手機
That would've worked, but they took my phone.

588
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:52,700
而手機在好幾里地外的建筑里  露餡了吧
And it's in a building, like, a mile away. So, yeah, nice try.

589
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,840
就這樣
That's right.

590
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,400
還說女人智商碾壓男人  奇點一下吧
So much for women outsmarting men. Singularity that!

591
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,360
我只是想說
Look, all I'm saying is that

592
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,770
我覺得你們可以再把故事編得好一些
I think that you could've come up with a better story,

593
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,270
這樣才有趣...
it could have been funny or...

594
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,200
好吧  你別生氣啊
Okay, alright, don't be pissed.

595
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,710
你有沒想過你的銀行賬戶是怎么被黑的
Do you ever wonder how your bank account got hacked?

596
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,040
你在干什么
What are you doing?

597
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,420
-你睡著的時候我復制了你的卡  -好吧
- I cloned your card as you were asleep. - Okay.

598
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,460
把刀放下  你拿刀干什么
Put the knife down. What are you going to do with that?

599
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,290
是我讓你注意到了這個工作
I drew your attention to this job.

600
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,010
索尼婭  把刀放下好嗎  這不好玩
Sonja, put the fucking knife down, okay? It's not funny.

601
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,390
你應該打給你媽  庫珀
Should've called your mum, Cooper.

602
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,290
-但是你聯系了我    -索尼婭
- But you called me...  - Sonja.

603
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,820
我又引你來到了這里
and I led you here...

604
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,210
-聽我說  -就像面包屑引路
- You know what? - ...like a breadcrumb trail.

605
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,210
把刀放下  別演了
Put the knife down. Drop the act.

606
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,010
說真的  把刀放下  索尼婭
Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

607
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,030
這他媽不好玩了  把刀放...
It's not fucking funny. Put the knife...

608
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,890
我可不是來挨刀子的  我受夠了好嗎
This isn't what I signed up for. I'm fucking done, okay?

609
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:47,910
我去
Fuck!

610
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,910
我去
Fuck!

611
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,340
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?

612
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,570
我去
Oh, fuck!

613
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,000
我了個天
Holy fuck!

614
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,450
停
Stop!

615
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,660
停
Stop!

616
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,930
我操
Fuck!

617
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,010
我操
Fuck!

618
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,160
操  操
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

619
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,000
操  操
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

620
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,680
-庫珀  -凱蒂
- Cooper. - Katie!

621
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,210
-凱蒂  -庫珀
- Katie! - Cooper.

622
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,500
-凱蒂  -庫珀  怎么回事
- Katie! - Cooper, what's happening?

623
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,270
這他媽搞什么鬼
What the fuck happened?

624
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:52,960
發生什么了
What's happening?

625
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,120
我們在呼叫你  你一直不回話
We've been talking. You've not been responding.

626
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,310
你不是說我什么都感覺不到嗎
You said I wouldn't feel anything!

627
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,170
你看到什么了  出現什么了
What are you seeing? What's there?

628
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,310
-我操  但是她不見了  -誰不見了
- Fuck! She's gone now. - Who's gone?

629
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,130
我的天  我都感覺到了
Oh, my God, I... I felt it.

630
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,790
我胳膊上被捅了把刀子
There's a knife in my arm!

631
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,350
-就肩膀上  -庫珀  你看見誰了
- In my shoulder. - Cooper, who was there?

632
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,170
-媽的...索尼婭  -誰
- Fuck... Sonja. - Who?

633
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,950
索尼婭  是我認識的一妞
Sonja. She's this girl that I know,

634
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,390
她媽逼的捅了我
that fucking- -  She stabbed me.

635
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,200
-她還拿了把刀  -你不會受傷的  庫珀
- She had a fucking knife. - Nothing can harm you, Cooper.

636
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,700
-不不不  我摸得到她  -那不可能
- No, no, no, no. She was solid. - No, she can't have been.

637
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,200
她...我被捅了  我還不知道嗎
She- -  I was stabbed! I would know!

638
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,810
你看見的一切事物都不會觸碰或傷害到你
Nothing you see can harm or even touch you.

639
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,460
只是純粹的視聽效果
It's purely audio- visual.

640
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,730
-不會有體感的  -操  怎么沒體感
- There's no physical sensation. - Fuck! Yes, there was!

641
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,320
庫珀你得冷靜下來
Cooper, you need to calm down.

642
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,230
我都感覺到了好嗎
I know because I felt it, okay?

643
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,240
我感覺到了她的胳膊  還有體溫
I felt her arm, it was warm,

644
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,690
我還感覺到她捅了我肩膀一刀
and I felt her fucking stab me in the shoulder.

645
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,930
-這不可能  -我的天
- That's not possible. -  Oh, my God.

646
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,230
-這不可能啊  庫珀  -是真的  真的
- It's not possible, Cooper. - Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

647
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,890
身體應該是沒有任何感覺的
Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.

648
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,120
-除非  -我的天  除非什么
- Unless, I mean... - Oh, God. Unless what?

649
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,100
我不知道  神經網絡也許通過某種機制
I don't know. The neuron net, it could have maybe worked out

650
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,660
創造出了體感知覺
some means of replicating physical experiences,

651
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,690
-但這是前所未有的事  -我的天
- but that would be unprecedented. - Jesus Christ.

652
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,120
我告訴你  馬上停止游戲
Okay, you know what? Stop the game.

653
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,410
我不干了  把我撤出去
I want out. Just pull me out now.

654
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,380
停停停  聽見安全詞了嗎  媽的快停
Stop, stop, stop. Safe word. Fucking stop!

655
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,780
-好了  讓我們想個辦法  -我的天
- Okay, okay, just let us work it out. - Oh, God.

656
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,910
不行  我現在就把這玩意挖出來
No, I want this fucking thing out now.

657
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,150
庫珀  千萬不要自己動手拔出來
Cooper, do not attempt to remove that yourself.

658
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,040
自行移除設備危險性非常大
Removing it yourself is extremely dangerous.

659
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,570
停下  你會死的
Stop that, that could kill you!

660
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,210
冷靜
Just stay calm!

661
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,280
那是翔嗎
Is that Shou?

662
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,170
是翔嗎  他說什么  他在說什么
Is that Shou? What's he saying? What's he saying?

663
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,810
好了庫珀  我們要啟動退出程序了
Okay, Cooper. We're gonna commence with deactivation.

664
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,760
真是太好了
Oh, that's great news.

665
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,550
我們需要你服從指令
We need you to follow instructions

666
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,520
到達接入點
and make it to the access point.

667
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,160
接入點  好極了  這個破接入點在哪
The access point? Great. Where the fuck's the access point?

668
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:52,290
-我操還要爬樓  拜托  -最后一層了
- Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on! - Just one more level.

669
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,590
-相信我  -好吧
- Trust me. - Okay.

670
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,940
頂層左轉
Left at the top.

671
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,150
-哪扇門  -盡頭的房間
- Okay, which door? - Room at the end.

672
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,580
怎么了
What is it?

673
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,260
里面有很不好的東西  我能感覺到
There's gonna be something bad in there. I can feel it.

674
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,590
-就像是...  -什么
- Something like... - Like what?

675
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,350
私人的什么破事
Some personal fucked-up shit.

676
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,540
我能感覺到這玩意在我腦子里打探
Like... I don't know, I could feel it digging around in my head.

677
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,820
庫珀  去開門
Cooper, get to the door.

678
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,490
大概是我媽  或許...死了
It's gonna be like my mum, I don't know, dead.

679
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,260
-你母親  -吊在房梁上
- Your mum? - Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.

680
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:33,580
-你母親不在里面  -你又控制不了
- Your mother is not in there. - You're not in control of this!

681
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,430
它在我腦子里  它知道的
It's in my head. It fucking knows. It knows.

682
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,400
-它知道  -知道什么
- It knows! - It knows what?

683
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,820
知道我和我媽之間的事
It knows I got this thing with my mum.

684
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,610
庫珀  我保證  你母親不在里面
Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there.

685
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,790
-快開門吧  -我的天啊
- Now open the door. - Oh, my God.

686
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:49,840
只有這樣我才能接你出來  聽我的
It's the only way I can get you out. Listen to me.

687
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,500
好吧  好
Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay.

688
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:56,410
不管房間里有什么都不會傷害你
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.

689
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,200
但你不開門我就沒法讓你退出  庫珀
But I can't get you out unless you open that door, Cooper.

690
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,820
請你快點開門吧
Would you kindly open the door?

691
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,270
開了  開了
Here we go. Here we go.

692
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,530
好吧
Okay.

693
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:29,840
好了  我進房間了  接入點在哪
Okay, okay, I'm in the room. Where's the access point?

694
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,790
接入點
Access point?

695
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,900
-根本就沒有接入點  -什么
- There is no access point. - What?

696
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,900
我逗你玩呢  庫珀
I'm fucking with you, Cooper.

697
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,330
我讓你爬到這里就是想看你會不會崩潰到
I told you to come up here to see if we've broken you enough

698
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,790
無條件服從命令
to obey instructions without question.

699
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,770
-我們做到了  -不不不
- And we have. - Oh, no, no, no.

700
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,380
凱蒂  別這樣凱蒂  拜托  讓我出去
Katie, come on. Katie, come on, let me out!

701
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,340
凱蒂  讓我出去  搞什么鬼
Katie, let me out, come on! What the fuck!

702
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,830
你要做什么  你要對我做什么
Oh, what are you gonna do? Oh, what are you doing to me?

703
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,350
-你為什么要這么做  -你以為會看見母親
- Why are you doing this? - You thought you'd see your mother.

704
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,790
-操  -她長什么樣
- Oh, fuck! - What does she look like?

705
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,750
你母親  你能形容一下她的相貌嗎
Your mother, can you describe her face?

706
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:10,580
她的發色什么的
Her hair colour?

707
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,340
她
She...

708
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,450
她高矮胖瘦
Is she tall, short, fat, thin?

709
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:18,570
-你在哪長大  -她...
- Where did you grow up? - She...

710
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,050
你最喜歡的樂隊  最喜歡的冰淇淋口味
What's your favourite band? Your favourite flavour ice cream?

711
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,250
那個捅了你的女孩的名字
The name of the girl who stabbed you?

712
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,940
你全都想不起來了  是不是
You don't know any of these things, do you?

713
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,700
你不覺得奇怪嗎
Don't you think that's odd?

714
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,090
它把我的記憶奪走了
It's fucking taking my memories!

715
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,590
嚴格來講是覆蓋了
Overwriting them, technically.

716
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,310
看著你身后的鏡子
Look in the mirror behind you.

717
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,620
你還認得你自己嗎
