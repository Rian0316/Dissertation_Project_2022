咱倆有一陣沒見了
Ah, it's been a while.

36

別把這當負擔

Moving along.

54
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,750
戴維斯梅因律所真的很盡力
Davis & Main are, uh... really pulling their weight.

55
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,000
他們最好盡力
Well, they better.

56
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,080
案子很復雜
It's a complex case.

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,380
這案子肯定不是兩個人就能搞定的
Well, it's definitely not a two-man job, that's for sure.

58
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,620
誰有吉米的消息嗎
Anyone, uh, heard from Jimmy?

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,550
我有  我跟他談過
I have, yes. I've talked to him.

60
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,100
他怎么樣
How is he?

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,710
他很好
He's fine.

62
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,440
還不錯
Doing well.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,650
說到他  我有些消息
Speaking of which... I have some news.

64
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,710
他在戴維斯梅因律所工作
He's working at Davis & Main.

65
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,810
做什么
Doing what?

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,950
是做律師啊
Oh, working as an attorney.

67
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,760
克利福德·梅因雇了吉米
Clifford Main hired Jimmy?

68
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,100
說實話  他也有疑慮
To be fair, he had his doubts,

69
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,240
但他給了吉米一個機會
but he's giving Jimmy a chance.

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,090
他派自己的手下去跟客戶聯系
He had his own people doing client outreach,

71
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,800
但他們每次和磯鷂渡的居住者談話
but every time they would talk to a Sandpiper resident,

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,640
住戶就會讓吉米出馬
Jimmy's name would come up.

73
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,930
你知道的  他
You know, he...

74
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,410
-那些老人  他們  -他們喜歡他
- Those old folks, they just -- - They love him.

75
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,490
的確是
Yeah, they do.

76
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,850
另外  我猜克利福德希望
Plus, I guess Cliff thought it would be a good idea

77
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,130
案子有那種...
for the case to have that sort of, uh...

78
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,420
連續性
you know... continuity.

79
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,300
吉米待人處事有一套
Jimmy certainly has a way with people.

80
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,170
是啊
He does.

81
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,620
戴維斯梅因律所知道他的背景嗎
They're aware of his background at Davis & Main?

82
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,100
他的教育情況
His education?

83
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,590
不瞞你說
In the spirit of full disclosure,

84
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,470
克利福徳之前確實跟我談過
Cliff did talk to me beforehand.

85
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,120
我都實話跟他說了
I didn't pull any punches.

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,790
我盡可能客觀地跟他說
I tried to paint a complete picture.

87
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,240
但我沒有礙事
But I didn't stand in the way.

88
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,000
當然了
Of course not.

89
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,830
你也不應該礙事
Nor should you.

90
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,040

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,150
沒錯  我們真該買一個
Yeah. We definitely got to get a smoker.

184
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,750
好吧...
All right, well...

185
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,470
我得去美甲店了
I got to go to the salon.

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,240
他們要運來我嶄新的公司用車
They're delivering my new company car.

187
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,270
真的嗎
Ugh, are you serious?

好嫉妒哦
Totally.

No?

220
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,160
我在這兒工作
I work here.

221
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,530
真巧啊
Small world.

222
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,280
那這里是警局的停車場嗎
So, is this the parking lot for the police station?

223
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,620
是的
It is.

224
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,890
你不知道他們能不能讓我進  對吧
You don't know if they validate, do you?

225
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,310
不如你在那邊停車吧
Why don't you pull around over there,

我們談幾句
and we'll have a little talk.

好吧
Uh, okay.

228
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,960
你來這干什么
Why are you here?

229
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,540
我有事找警察
I-I have business with the police.

230
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,920
是什么事呢
And what business might that be?

231
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,590
如果你非要知道的話  我被搶劫了
Well, if you must know, I was robbed.

232
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,610
有人闖進我家  偷走了我的財產
Somebody broke into my house and stole my property.

233
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,960
你的毒品吧
Your drugs.

234
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,670
是的  但顯然我沒對警察說
Yeah, but obviously I didn't tell the cops that.

235
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,030
我又不蠢
I'm not stupid.

236
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,750
你已經和他們說過情況了嗎
You've already spoken to them?

237
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,410
兩個警察來過我家
A couple of them came by my house.

238
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,850
但我在意的不是毒品
But it's not the drugs that I care about.

239
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,310
不  我在意
I mean, I care.

240
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,140
但我更想討回我的棒球卡片
It's my baseball cards I need back.

241
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,330
-你的棒球卡片  -是的
- Your baseball cards? ‭- Yes.

242
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,560
我有一套非常珍貴的棒球卡片集
I have a very valuable collection of baseball cards,

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,990
被人偷走了
and someone stole them.

244
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,990
我就知道還得我來跟你說
I guess I shouldn't be surprised I have to tell you this.

245
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,920
你已經是個罪犯了  還主動找警察談話
But it's probably a bad idea that you willingly talk to the police,

246
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,240
這大概不是個好主意
being a criminal and all.

247
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,420
我又不是以罪犯的身份來的
I'm not here as a criminal.

248
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,880
我是受害者
I'm here as a crime victim.

249
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,850
我只是偶爾賣賣藥品
Just because I occasionally sell some pharmaceuticals,

250
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,330
就要失去受法律保護的權利嗎
I no longer have a right to protection from crime?

251
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,210
而且我和他們談的時候非常謹慎
And I was very careful when I talked to them.

252
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,590
他們不知道我賣藥
I -- they have no idea about my other business.

253
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,400
既然你已經報告過情況了  為什么還要來
If you already made your report, why are you here?

254
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,490
他們喊我來的
They called me.

255
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,000
說還有幾個問題要問
They have a few more questions.

256
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,430
他們很努力地在尋找小偷
They are very dedicated to finding this thief.

257
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,530
既然你還是個新手  我來給你解釋一下
Since you're new to this, let me explain it to you.

258
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,110
他們在釣魚
They've invited you on a fishing trip.

259
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,080
什么意思  釣魚
What's that? A fishing trip?

260
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,650
那些警察對討回你的卡片根本沒興趣
Those cops have no interest in helping you get your cards back.

261
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,890
他們顯然懷疑你
You're obviously under suspicion.

262
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,200
他們什么也沒看到啊
There was nothing there for them to see.

263
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,880
你想想我們之前的談話
I refer you ‭to our previous conversation

264
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,970
再看看這個如霓虹燈般閃閃發光的
and this blinking neon sign of a vehicle

265
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,050
寫滿"毒販子"三個字的車
that says "Drug dealer."

266
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,390
他們懷疑你
They suspect you.

267
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,300
他們會讓你進去  裝作是你的朋友
They will get you in there, pretend to be your friend,

268
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,110
給你一種虛假的安全感
lull you into a false sense of security,

269
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,250
然后他們會讓你心虛
and then they will sweat you.

270
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,590
你就會露出破綻
and you will break.

271
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,290
我不  我
I don't -- I --

272
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,390
我不同意
I disagree.

273
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,010
沒有商量的余地  你現在就回家
Not open for debate. You go home now.

274
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,630
但是我和他們約好了啊
But I have an appointment.

275
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,660
爽約
Break it.

276
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,040
如果他們打電話給你  別接
And if they call you, do not answer the phone.

277
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,860
那我的棒球卡片怎么辦
But what about my baseball cards?

278
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,280
那是你生意的代價
Cost of doing business.

279
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,600
不行  不不不
No! No, no, no!

280
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,320
我得討回來
I am getting those back!

281
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,200
我愿意冒險
I will take the risk!

282
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
不  你不能冒險
No, you won't.

283
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,710
因為你會把我也置于險境
Because then you'll be putting my well-being at risk.

284
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,360
我只能這樣
I have to!

285
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,690
我  我
I-I --

286
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,940
那些卡片啊
Those cards?

287
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,320
有一部分是我爸留給我的
Some of them were my dad's.

288
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,600
我要討回來
I-I am getting them back.

289
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,470
我必須討回來
I'm getting them back.

290
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,630
我會找到你的卡片的
I'll find your cards.

291
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,960
先生  你
Is -- sir--

292
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,540
你也能做這個嗎
Is that something you do?

293
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,240
那真是
Wow, that's...

294
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,700
那你真是太好了
That is so generous of you.

295
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,800
你要付我錢的
Oh, it'll cost you.

296
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,780
好吧
Okay, uh...

297
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,750
我們可以討論下財務問題
We should discuss some sort of financial arrangement

298
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,640
我可以...
in which I-I, uh...

沒關系  我只是彈琴放松一下
Not at all. I was just blowing off some steam.

- You sound good. - ‭Thank you.

Oh, I tried to learn in high school,

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,450
但后來我決定用更簡單的方法追女孩
but then I decided there were easier ways to get girls.

311
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,630
我希望你有減壓的方法
well, I hope you've got a way to decompress.

你在這適應得怎么樣
How you settling in?

314
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,540
挺好的
Great.

315
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,600
對我來說是向前邁了一大步
Uh, it's -- ‭it's quite a step up for me.

316
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,010
我們很高興有你加入
Well, we're happy to have you.

317
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,620
有其他需要隨時告訴我們  吉米
Just let us know if there's anything else you need, Jimmy.

318
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,660
謝謝  克利福德
Thanks...Cliff.

319
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,280
我也很高興能加入這里
Um, I'm happy to be here.

320
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,670
很好
Great.

321
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,900
我該回去工作了
Uh, better get back to it.

322
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,670
好的  我也該工作了
Yeah, me, too, I suppose.

323
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,500
其實  我在首次信息披露中發現了點東西
Actually, um, ‭I might have found something in the initial disclosures.

324
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,010
-是嗎  -斯韋卡特和考科利不斷提到
- Oh, yeah? - Schweikart and Cokely keep referring to

325
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,340
這是一個"可選的津貼項目"
the "Optional Allowance Program,"

326
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,100
但是我查了很多住戶的合同
but I checked a number of residents' contracts.

327
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,860
所有合同都選擇了這個津貼計劃
Not a single one has opted out, which makes me think

328
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,720
我認為這更像是一個強制性的財務安排
it's more of a mandatory financial arrangement.

329
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,530
你認為這就是他們在提交的材料中所指的
And you're thinking that's the "Failure to state a claim"

330
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,070
"對起訴的申辯"嗎
that they filed in their answer?

331
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,510
他們不斷強調這是可選計劃  是自愿的
They keep saying it's optional, thereby voluntary.

332
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,120
我們可以利用這點來反擊
I think we can counter that

333
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,450
如果入住的前提條件是必須"選擇加入"
if "Opting in" is a requirement for residency,

334
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,950
事實也是如此
which it sure seems to be,

335
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,680
那他們聲稱的"自愿"就站不住腳了
well, their voluntary claims don't hold water.

336
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,810
你這個發現可能意義重大
Might be on to something here.

337
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,280
干得漂亮  吉米
Nice work, Jimmy.

338
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,030
謝謝  克利福德
Thanks, Cliff.

339
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,860
你好
Hola.

340
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,060
你好啊
Hola. Cómo estás?

341
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,150
歡迎光臨  有什么能為您效勞的
Welcome. How can I help you?

342
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,640
我想打聽下價錢
Um, I was hoping to get an estimate.

343
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,600
是我的車
Uh, mi car. Mi coche.

344
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,860
你們可以干車子的活吧
You do cars?

345
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,720
當然可以  沒問題
Sí. Cars. Todo el tiempo.

346
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,450
我想把坐椅的椅面換一下
I-I was hoping ‭to get my seats reupholstered.

347
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,060
跟我出去看一下好嗎
Um, take a look? Mira?

348
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,150
-稍等一下  -好的
- Un momento. - ‭Sí, sí, sí, sí.

349
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,350
謝謝
Gracias.

350
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,790
就是這輛
Yeah.

351
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,250
換點新鮮東西
Thinking something new.

352
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,030
給這個老家伙一點寵愛
Give the old girl a little love.

353
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:57,830
{\an8}我很高興做這個工作  但是有這些錢還不如買輛新車
I'm happy for the work, but his money might be better spent on a down payment for a new car.

354
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,300
他說你還是留著錢買輛新車比較劃算
He said you should save your money and get a new car.

355
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,630
是嗎  但是我對這輛車有特殊的感情
Yeah? Well, it has a sentimental value.

356
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,530
古董車
Classic car.

357
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,070
{\an8}他想要什么樣的
What's he looking for?

358
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,450
椅面想用什么材料
What material do you want?

359
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,120
當然是皮的
Well, I was thinking leather, definitely.

360
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,130
鱷魚皮就不錯
Maybe alligator.

361
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,270
那要花好多錢呢
Señor. Too much money.

362
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,870
是  但我說了  我對這車有感情
Yeah, but like I said, it has a sentimental value.

363
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:42,340
{\an8}我覺得奇奇怪怪的皮革跟這車不太配
I think an exotic leather would clash.

364
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,330
{\an8}換點跟車的風格更搭的材料比較好
Maybe something a little more consistent with the style of the car.

365
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,300
{\an8}說服他
Convince him.

366
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,660
他說鱷魚皮跟這輛車不搭
He says, uh, alligator's gonna look all wrong.

367
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,010
便宜點的材料更好
Cheaper might be better.

368
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,160
給我看看你選的
Well, show me what you'd pick.

369
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,610
抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, señor.

370
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,090
我兒子  讓他來幫你  行嗎
My son -- ‭he -- he will help you, okay?

371
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,990
{\an8}幫他選個材料
Help him pick.

372
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,100
{\an8}別給他推銷貴的了
And don't try to upsell him, okay?

373
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,970
見到你很高興
Mucho gusto.

374
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,290
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

375
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,450
你找我干什么
Why are you here?

376
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,940
棒球卡
Baseball cards.

377
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,950
我猜  你看到那個開豪車的中年危機男
The way I figure, you saw that mid-life crisis of a vehicle

378
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,070
就明智地決定不和他做生意了
and wisely decided ‭to cut ties with the man,

379
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,930
這我不怪你  因為我也不和他做了
and I don't blame you -- I did, too.

380
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,370
但是你劫了他家
And then you ripped him off.

381
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,530
我相信順走那些棒球卡
And I'm sure those baseball cards

382
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,600
還能從那個蠢貨身上額外撈一筆
looked like an easy way to make a few extra bucks

383
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,160
順便還能給他上一課
off that idiot, teach him a lesson, too.

384
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,040
但是你低估了
But you underestimated

385
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,740
這個人有多么白癡
just how big an idiot you were dealing with.

386
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,760
不  我很清楚
No, I am pretty aware.

387
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,910
好吧  那么你低估了
Well, then, you underestimated

388
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,040
這個人對這些棒球卡片的感情有多深
how attached the man was to those cards --

389
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:21,300
深到他打給警察報失
so attached he called the police and reported them stolen.

390
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,850
現在警察在到處查
Now they're nosing around.

391
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,890
這好像是你的問題
That sounds like a "you" problem.

392
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,710
不  我覺得更像是我們的問題
No, I think it's very much an "us" problem.

393
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,680
我想我還是碰碰運氣吧
Yeah, I guess I'll just have to take my chances.

394
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,830
不過祝你好運
But good luck to you.

395
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,730
我還希望你能看到我們的困境
You know, I was hoping you'd see our dilemma

396
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,080
做出正確的選擇
and do the right thing.

397
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,580
但我想現在是一個軟硬兼施的情況
But I think what we have here now is a carrot-and-stick situation.

398
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,880
是嗎
Oh, yeah?

399
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,590
這是要來硬的嗎
This is the stick? Hmm?

400
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,990
你來威脅我的家人嗎
You coming here, threatening my family?

401
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,530
你得再強硬些  老東西
'Cause you're gonna need a bigger stick, old man.

402
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,600
我不是要威脅你的家人
I'm not here to threaten your family.

403
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,590
真正的狠角色是屠庫·塞拉曼加
And the name of the stick is Tuco Salamanca.

404
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,070
如果你不照我說的做  恕我直言
Now, you don't play ball, so to speak,

405
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,160
屠庫要是發現了你的第二職業
and Tuco finds out about your little side business.

406
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,160
這夠硬了嗎
That a big enough stick?

407
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,500
不過  我還是更喜歡軟的
However, I prefer the carrot.

408
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,810
我覺得你也會喜歡
I think you will, too.

409
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,310
那要怎么做
And what would that be?

410
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,430
你把棒球卡片還給我
You give me back the baseball cards,

411
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,700
還有一萬美金現鈔
$10,000 in cash,

412
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,150
你還可以凈賺大約
and you net roughly --

413
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,830
大約六萬美金
roughly -- $60,000.

414
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,070
那要如何做到
And how exactly does that work?

415
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,680
歐內斯托
Ernesto.

416
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,870
要出門嗎
Going somewhere?

417
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,490
是的
Yes, we are.

418
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,230
轉彎的時候需要些技巧
She's a little tricky around the corners.

419
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:04,100
而且  得加高級汽油
So... and you got to go with the premium gas.

420
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,120
我知道這好像是騙人的  但還是有很大不同
I know it seems like a scam, but it makes a huge difference.

421
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,820
我會一周洗一次車
And I would get her washed at least once a week.

422
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,770
還要手工打蠟
And spring for the hand wax.

423
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,540
這透明涂層需要多一層保護
You're gonna want that extra layer of protection for the clear coat.

424
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,510
這車值得最好的保護
She deserves the best.

425
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,360
我會確保拆車廠的伙計們
I'll make sure the boys at the chop shop

426
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,690
對她溫柔一些的
are real gentle with her.

427
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,530
等等  為什么要拆
Wait. W-why?

428
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,820
不
No.

429
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,670
你覺得我會開那輛車嗎
You think I'd be caught dead driving that thing?

430
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,460
那就跟六歲皮條客的校車一樣
It looks like a school bus for 6-year-old pimps.

431
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,650
好了  我們能繼續了嗎
All right, shall we move this along?

432
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,360
阿倫
Aaron.

433
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,150
好  這是基特那張
Okay, there's Jeter.

434
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,960
好的  好的
All right. Okay.

435
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,680
曼托  曼托  這是曼托那張
Mantle. Mantle. There's Mantle.

436
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,620
完事了嗎
‭We good?

437
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,720
是的  好像都在這兒
Uh, yeah, that looks like everyone.

438
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,520
都在  都在這兒了
Yeah, they're here. ‭Looks like everyone's here.

439
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,640
另外一樣
And now the other item.

440
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,320
現在我們的交易正式結束
And now our business is concluded.

441
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,960
我一直在想是不是該向你道歉
You know, I can't help thinking an apology was in order.

442
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,080
又是警察打來的
Uh, it's -- it's the police again.

443
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,100
磯鷂渡并沒有真正回應我們的披露請求
Sandpiper hasn't really responded to our discovery requests.

444
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,330
他們讓我們做了大量文書工作
They've buried us in paperwork,

445
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,350
但沒有任何東西跟這個案子的詳情有關
but nothing actually relevant to the particulars in this case.

446
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,800
意料之中
No real surprise there.

447
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,770
我們也許該要求他們出示銀行記錄
We may have to subpoena their bank records.

448
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,940
謝謝  艾琳  吉米
Thank you, Erin. Jimmy.

449
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,750
客戶那兒處理的怎么樣了
How we doing with client outreach?

450
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,120
我們在等那些傳票的同時
Oh, while we're waiting on those subpoenas,

451
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,400
還應該嘗試從客戶那里
I'm thinking we should try wrangling some of this stuff

452
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,900
獲取文件
from the clients themselves.

453
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,580
他們中大部分人都會保留復印文本
Most of these folks have hard copies of everything

454
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,480
可追溯到埃森豪威爾時代
going back to ‭the Eisenhower administration.

455
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,630
當然  考慮到他們的...
Of course, given some of their, uh...

456
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,370
不一致的組織方式
inconsistent organizational practices,

457
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,940
進展會很緩慢
it's gonna be slow going.

458
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,560
抱歉打斷一下
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

459
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,570
有一位女士  人很好
Uh, this one lady, um, she's sweet,

460
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,860
但是完全聽不見
but, uh, deaf as a doornail.

461
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,630
她把所有的文件都放在  放在
She keeps all of her paperwork in, um, she keeps it --

462
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,070
對不起  抱歉  吉米
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jimmy.

463
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,470
我需要所有人的手機
I'm gonna need everybody's phone,

464
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,170
鑰匙  還有電子設備
key fobs, and electronics.

465
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,170
查克  歡迎
Chuck. Welcome.

466
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,840
請坐
Please. Have a seat.

467
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,850
不要在意我
Don't mind me.

468
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,940
大家好
Hey, everybody.

469
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,970
抱歉打擾了
Sorry for the interruption.

470
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,390
就當我不在這兒
Just pretend I'm not here.

471
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,990
很高興你能來
Happy to have you.

472
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,000
吉米  我們說到哪兒了
Jimmy, where were we?

473
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,210
對
Uh, yeah.

474
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,650
我正說到...
So, I was saying...

475
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,170
從部分委托人那獲取文件
getting the documents from some of the clients...

476
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,510
他們中的有些人顯然是囤物狂
We definitely have some pack rats.

477
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,620
祝他們好運
God bless 'em.

478
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,940
我那天去拜訪圣達菲磯鷂渡的古斯多夫女士
I was visiting Mrs. Gusdorff at, uh, Sandpiper Santa Fe,

479
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,330
那天下午我都在整理大賣場發放的
and I spent the whole afternoon sorting through just a haystack

480
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,680
成堆的菜譜和半價優惠券
of recipes and half-off coupons from Big Lots.

481
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,700
但整理的成果是這位女士
But now we've got copies of this woman's monthly statements

482
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,250
從1997年3月起的月賬單
going back to march 1997,

483
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,870
因此  盡管這樣有些耗費人力
so it might be a little labor-intensive,

484
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:45,150
但委托人永遠是我們最好的資源
but our clients will always be our best resource.

485
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,590
此外  他們那還有糖吃

你的道德觀念還夠靈活嗎
You still morally flexible?

497
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,690
如果是  我有個活兒給你
If so, I might have a job for you.

498
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,350
何時何地
Where and when?

499
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,930
請坐
Take a seat.

500
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,670
沃莫爾德先生  感謝你能前來配合調查
Mr. Wormald, thank you for coming in and talking to us.

501
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,800
當然
Yeah, of course.

502
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,260
我們看了警官在現場
Yeah, we've been looking at the reports

503
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,000
所寫的報告
that the officers took at the scene,

504
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,350
我們有幾個后續的小問題
and we have a few ‭small follow-up questions.

505
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,190
抱歉浪費你的時間  只是常規流程
Sorry to waste your time. Just standard stuff.

506
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,270
沒必要帶律師過來
There's really no need for a lawyer to be here.

507
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,030
我其實是來當他的顧問
I'm here in more of an advisory capacity.

508
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,210
丹只是想有個友善的人在他身邊
Dan just, uh, wanted a friendly face next to him.

509
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,020
我們都很友善啊
‭Well, we're all friendly here.

510
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,240
看看我們  四個朋友
Look at us. Four friends.

511
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,330
我們只是想理清事實
We just want to get the facts straight

512
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,460
以便幫你找回你的財物
so we can, um, help you get your property for you.

513
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,350
其實...沒關系的
Yeah, you know, uh, it's fine.

514
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,450
用不著...
Uh, yeah, there's no need to, uh --

515
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,360
不  這只是常規程序
No, it's just standard procedure.

516
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,730
你知道  警官有時
You know, ‭officers don't always get

517
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,030
也無法把所有的所需信息寫進報告里
all the information we need in their report.

518
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,210
我們只是想抓住偷了你的棒球卡的人
We just want to find the guys who took your baseball cards.

519
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,220
是啊  那...
Yeah, that's, uh...

520
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:00,200
我叔叔有一張泰·柯布的煙草卡
You know, my uncle ‭had a Ty Cobb tobacco card.

521
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,470
他把那玩意存放在十五厘米厚的玻璃底下
Kept that thing behind six inches of glass

522
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,460
好像是幅名畫一樣
like it was the Mona Lisa or something.

523
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,960
泰·柯布
Wow. Ty Cobb?

524
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,850
告訴他把光線調暗
Tell him to keep the lights low.

525
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,430
就算是人工照明也會釋放一定量的
Even artificial lighting has a certain amount

526
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:15,140
紫外輻射  那可能會...
of ultraviolet radiation that can, uh, you know...

527
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,090
長遠來看...
over the long term --

528
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,220
你能告訴我們
Um, can you just remind us

529
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,320
你在屋子里存放卡片的準確位置嗎
exactly where you kept your cards in the house?

530
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,150
好的  正如我想說的  那再不是問題了
Yeah, well, uh, as I was trying to say, it's no longer an issue.

531
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,610
我找到它們了
I found them.

532
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,660
你找到卡片了
So you found the cards?

533
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,790
是的
Uh, yep.

534
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,790
我就是想親自過來  告訴你們
I just wanted to come down and tell you, you know, in person.

535
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,910
你找到了
You found them?

536
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,730
在哪  房子周圍嗎
Where? Around the house?

537
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,890
不是  我雇了私家偵探
No. I, uh, I hired a private investigator,

538
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,850
他找到了卡片
and he tracked them down.

539
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,120
是的
So, yeah.

540
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,250
真的嗎  哪兒找到的
Really? So, where were they?

541
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,470
沒關系了  真的
You know, it's fine. It is.

542
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,910
我真的...我不能再打擾你們了
I really -- I ought to get out of your hair.

543
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,650
你們在我身上浪費的時間夠多了
You've wasted enough time on me.

544
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,650
不  不  沒關系  這是我們的工作
No, no, it's -- ‭it's okay. It's our job.

545
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,520
我們只是想弄清真相
We just want to get the facts right

546
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,160
以便幫你結案
so we can help close this case for you.

547
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,350
已經搞定了
It's done.

548
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,920
案子結了
Case closed!

549
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,980
我知道你們有多...
I just -- I know how much, you know,

550
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,740
你們有多少案子需要處理
you guys have on your hands,

551
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,580
殺人犯  搶劫犯  黑幫什么的
like murderers and robbers and gangs and stuff. I --

552
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,780
丹尼  你要不要出去透會氣
Hey, Danny, ‭why don't you get some air?

553
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,750
你去喝點咖啡
You can have some coffee.

554
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,870
我來和警探們說清楚
I'll finish up ‭with the detectives here.

555
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,160
好了  伙計們  我們直說吧
Okay, let's get down to brass tacks here, guys.

556
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,610
我猜你們兩位制服整齊的警官
I'm guessing your two fine uniformed officers

557
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,710
發現了沃莫爾德先生藏東西的據點
found Mr. Wormald's little hidey hole,

558
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,570
所以你們才如此熱心地
and that's why you two are so interested

559
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,470
"幫助"我這位朋友
in "Helping" my friend here.

560
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,440
我明白
I get it.

561
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,200
在踢腳線背后發現藏匿地點
A hiding place in the baseboard --

562
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,630
任何人都會起疑心的
it's gonna make anyone suspicious.

563
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,790
但我保證沒有違法的事
But let me assure you there's nothing illegal going on here.

564
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,680
那他為什么這么緊張
Then why is he so nervous?

565
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,250
因為要我說  流汗就值得懷疑
'cause I must say, the flop sweat is kind of suspect.

566
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,210
我們都有秘密  不是嗎
We all have our secrets, don't we?

567
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,210
又有誰是一塵不染的呢
And who among us is without sin?

568
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,080
但那些罪過不全是犯罪
But those sins aren't all of the criminal variety,

569
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,230
沃莫爾德先生也沒有犯罪
and neither are Mr. Wormald's, okay?

570
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,400
但那是很私密的東西
They are, however, very private.

571
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,610
私密  比如販毒嗎
Private, like drug dealer, maybe?

572
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,070
不  當然不是
No, no!

573
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,830
他一直回避  因為那是個敏感話題
He's being evasive because it's a sensitive subject,

574
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,920
需要小心處理  和執法完全無關
very delicate, and of no concern to law enforcement.

575
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,260
盡管我們想相信你的話
You know, as much as we'd love to, um, take your word for it,

576
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,990
但你說的這些還不夠
we're gonna need a little more than that.

577
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,100
好吧  這都歸結到一起私人糾紛上
All right, well, this all comes down to a personal dispute.

578
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,230
就這樣
That's all.

579
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,000
是沃莫爾德先生
It's -- it's between, um, Mr. Wormald

580
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,920
還有他的藝術贊助人的糾紛
and, uh... his art patron.

581
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,850
-"藝術贊助人"  -沒錯
- "Art patron"? - ‭Yeah.

582
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:51,240
我的委托人和一個有錢人有一個協議
Uh, my client has an arrangement with a wealthy gentleman

583
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,570
沃莫爾德先生向他提供
for whom Mr. Wormald provides...

584
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,840
藝術品  以此獲得他慷慨的...
art in exchange for ‭this gentleman's generous, uh...

585
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,330
我們稱之為資助
We'll call it patronage.

586
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,930
藝術品  例如繪畫嗎
Art? Like -- like what? Paintings?

587
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,800
更像是電子媒體
It's more like digital media.

588
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,360
電子媒體
Digital media?

589
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,830
他為那個人拍視頻
He made videos for the man.

590
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,480
哪種視頻
What kind of videos?

591
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,710
具有藝術性的私人視頻
Private videos of an artistic nature.

592
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,740
那就是藏在暗道里的東西
That's what was in the hiding place.

593
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,040
就是這樣
That's what it's for.

594
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,820
那么這個藝術贊助人偷了視頻和棒球卡嗎
So, this art patron stole the videos and the baseball cards?

595
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,640
那是個誤會
Well, there was a misunderstanding.

596
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,080
還是叫創意分歧比較好
I mean, uh, ‭call it creative differences.

597
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,380
藝術家都是喜怒無常的
Artists are volatile creatures.

598
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,300
伙計們  這就是情人吵架
Guys, this all comes down to just a lovers' spat, okay?

599
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,410
兩個成年男子鬧翻了
Two consenting adults had a falling out.

600
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,420
常有的事
That happens.

601
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,650
贊助人偷了視頻
And the, uh, "Patron" stole the videos

602
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,480
還有棒球卡  我猜是為了"表明觀點"
and the baseball cards, uh, to "Make a point," I guess.

603
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,150
但關鍵是  都解決了
But the headline here is, it's all settled.

604
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,280
感情修復了
Hearts have mended,

605
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,440
沃莫爾德先生不會起訴
and Mr. Wormald will not be pressing charges.

606
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,920
視頻內容是什么
What was on these videos?

607
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,890
-很私密  -我知道
- They were private. - You've said that.

608
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,640
視頻內容意在
They were videos intended

609
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,790
刺激感官
to titillate the senses.

610
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,680
-好吧  是黃片嗎  -不
- Okay, so porn. - Not -- no.

611
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,560
不是這種
Not as such.

612
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,910
嚴格來說  應該是戀物視頻
Technically, they would be categorized as fetish videos.

613
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,810
但沒有違法內容
But nothing illegal.

614
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,590
就是一個男人  穿戴整齊  我補充一句
Just a man -- a fully clothed man, I might add --

615
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,810
只有他自己
Just all by himself.

616
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:36,600
沃莫爾德先生穿戴整齊
Just -- just Mr. Wormald fully clothed,

617
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,060
沒錯
yeah.

618
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,570
-就是這樣  -好的
- So... - All right.

619
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,720
所以穿戴整齊的沃莫爾德先生
So, fully clothed Mr. Wormald

620
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,580
在做什么事
by himself doing what?

621
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,970
是啊  在做什么
Yeah, come on, man. What?

622
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,000
"蹲派"
Squat cobbler.

623
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,970
蹲什么玩意兒
What's a s-squat cobbler?

624
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,590
蹲派  你們知道的
Squat cobbler. ‭You know what squat cobbler is.

625
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,040
不  我不知道那是什么
No, I don't -- I don't know what a squat cobbler is.

626
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,700
我也不知道  那是什么
No, me neither. What is it?

627
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,810
你們兩是警察嗎
What? And you two guys are cops?

628
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,000
霍博肯蹲派
Hoboken squat cobbler.

629
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,200
滿月派
Full moon moon-pie.

630

波士頓奶油派
Boston cream splat.

631
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,010
真的嗎
Seriously?

632
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,120
蹲男"西蒙"
Simple-simon-the-ass-man.

633
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,160
荷蘭蘋果蹲
Dutch apple ass.

634
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,810
伙計們  我說的不是英語嗎
Guys, am I not speaking english here?

635
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,340
蹲派到底是什么
What the hell is a squat cobbler?!

636
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,460
就是一個男人坐在派里
It's when a man sits in pie!

637
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,920
他坐在派里
He sits in a pie!

638
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,120
還來回扭動
And he... he wiggles around.

639
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,720
也許是好樂門蛋黃醬
Maybe it's like Hellmann's mayonnaise.

640
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,900
落基山以西有不同的叫法
It has a different name west of the Rockies.

641
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,790
我也不知道  但嚴格來說
I don't know. But, uh, technically,

642
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,600
他是邊哭邊蹲的
He does a crybaby squat, so there's tears,

643
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,840
所以看起來更專業
which makes it more specialized.

644
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
不是所有蹲派者都要哭的
Not all pie sitters cry.

645
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,380
但我要說的是
But I'm gonna tell you something.

646
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,010
這家伙一哭起來
This guy is a regular Julianne Moore

647
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,950
演得比朱麗安·摩爾還棒
once he gets ‭the waterworks cranked up.

648
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,990
派
Pies?

649
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,120
比如蘋果派嗎
What? Like apple?

650
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,030
伙計  不是我拍的好嗎
Guys, I'm not ‭the filmmaker here, all right?

651
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,170
有香蕉奶油  桃子
Banana cream. I -- uh, peach.

652
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,800
哦對  還要穿道具服裝
Oh, and there -- ‭and there is a costume involved.

653
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,370
你忽悠我們呢
You got to be shitting us.

654
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,620
是啊  隨便你們信不信
Yeah, like I would make this up.

655
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,340
大千世界無奇不有  兄弟
Hey, the world is ‭a rich tapestry, my friends.

656
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,370
不過相信我
But trust me on this.

657
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,100
你們不會想看的
You don't want to see it.

658
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,850
所以  沒事了  是吧
So, uh, we're good, right?

659
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,620
是  沒問題了
Yeah. Great.

660
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,340
不過  還有一個小隱患  要善后
There is, however, one little, tiny hanging chad.

661
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,270
什么  什么隱患
Well, what? What chad?

662
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,920
你得拍一個視頻
You're gonna have to make a video.

663
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:14,800
等等等等
wait. Wait.

664
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,000
他是把餡餅吃了還是坐在餡餅里
So he eats the pies or just sits in them?

665
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,350
都有  想要什么有什么
Both. Whatever you want.

666
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,820
哪個先來
Which comes first?

667
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,800
隨便他選
Uh, it's dealer's choice.

668
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,330
這時候就該上哭戲了  是吧
That's where the crying comes in, right?

669
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,900
哭戲是必須的
That's a safe bet.

670
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,510
你到底是怎么想出這主意的
How the hell ‭did you come up with that?

671
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,510
就是給我一百年
If you gave me a million years,

672
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,310
我也想不出這玩意
I still would not have come up with that.

673
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,310
靈感女神
The muse.

674
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,750
我說出了她的想法
She speaks through me.

675
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,760
我不過是區區傳話筒
I am but a humble vessel.

676
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,250
他們信了嗎
And they bought it?

677
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,700
信了
Yeah.

678
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,570
我也聽說過一些很離譜讓人難以相信的情節
I've heard some far-out scenarios used to sow doubt,

679
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,300
但這絕對是最扯淡[贏得蛋糕]的
but this definitely takes the cake.

680
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,290
金  金  金
Kim, Kim, Kim.

681
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,060
-知道啦是"餡餅"  -對
- Takes the pie. ‭- Yeah.

682
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,010
抱歉
Sorry.

683
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,950
我現在應該跳樓謝罪
I should just jump off the roof right now.

684
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,640
對啊  你是該自責
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.

685
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,460
天哪  你可真能謅
Jesus, can you tell a story.

686
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,290
我覺得其實是那視頻讓他們信了
Well, to be fair, I think it was the video that clinched it.

687
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,090
什么視頻
What video?

688
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,980
等等  你們真的拍了一個視頻
Wait, wait. You -- ‭you actually made a video?

689
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,760
不得不說  到最后  老丹還挺入戲的
I got to say, in the end, Ol' Dan really committed.

690
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,830
那眼淚把我都打動了
I believed the tears.

691
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:18,160
這個是剩下的道具  多出來的
Um, this is a leftover prop. It was extra.

692
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,910
我不確定我們要拍幾條  就多買了些
I wasn't sure how many takes we would need, so I over-bought,

693
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,620
不過我保證  絕對沒被屁股坐過
But I promise you, ‭untouched by human buttocks.

694
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,280
你偽造證據
You fabricated evidence?

695
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,660
我就拍了個視頻
I made a video.

696
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,750
算不上證據
Not exactly evidence.

697
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,410
你用它來為委托人脫罪
You used it to exonerate a client.

698
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,760
你用偽造的證據為委托人脫罪
You used falsified evidence to exonerate a client.

699
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,950
你這是鉆牛角尖
Mm, I think you're splitting hairs.

700
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,530
我沒有鉆牛角尖
I'm not splitting hairs.

701
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,960
萬一戴維斯梅因律所發現你偽造證據怎么辦
What if Davis & Main find out you faked evidence?

702
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,830
他不是戴維斯梅因律所的客戶
It wasn't a Davis & Main client.

703
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,470
這不是什么案子  無償的
It was some nothing, little pro-bono thing.

704
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,810
與工作無關  完全是  我的私事
It was off the clock. It was, uh, totally my own thing.

705
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,810
為什么
Why?

706
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,630
你為什么要冒丟工作的風險
Why would you risk the best job you've ever had

707
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,610
就為了一個無償服務的案子
for some pro-bono case?

708
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,480
我是幫朋友的忙
I was doing a favor for a friend.

709
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,310
冒著被取消律師資格的風險  真是良友
Risking disbarment? That's -- that's some friend.

710
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,620
沒事的  事情解決了
It's fine! It -- it worked out.

711
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,930
戴維斯梅因律所并不知情
Davis & Main are none the wiser.

712
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,640
吉米  你這是在玩火
Jimmy, ‭you're playing with fire here.

713
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,100
那天晚上那個混蛋肯
I didn't see you complaining

714
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,640
幫我們付酒單的時候  我可沒見你抱怨
when, um, Ken the douchebag paid our bar bill the other night.

715
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,150
是吧  那也有點違反規定了吧
No, that was a little bit of rule breaking right there.

716
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,010
要是我沒記錯  你還挺喜歡的
And if I remember correctly, you liked it.

717
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,770
很喜歡
A lot.

718
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,550
這完全不是一回事
That is so not the same thing.

719
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,180
怎么不是一回事  有什么區別
How? What's the difference?

720
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,700
那與工作無關
That had nothing to do with work.

721
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,870
而且我們就是在胡鬧
And we were just -- just screwing around.

722
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
但是這個
This?

723
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,490
偽造證據
Fabricating evidence.

724
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,450
吉米  這真的可能會害了你
Jimmy, ‭this could really hurt you.

725
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,260
如果他們發現了  如果你被抓
If they find out, if you get caught --

726
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,320
這  他們永遠不會發現的
It -- they're never gonna find out.

727
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:41,950
你不是吧
Seriously?

728
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,620
這話說得就跟那些蠢蛋罪犯一模一樣
You sound like every dumb criminal out there.

729
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,200
如果你再這么干  他們遲早會發現
If you keep this up, they will find out.

730
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,010
你圖什么  吉米
For what, Jimmy? ‭

731
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,100
到底為了什么
What is the point?

732
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,770
我不想再看到你做這種事情
I cannot hear ‭about this sort of thing.

733
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,170
一次也不行了  聽到了嗎
Ever again. Okay?

734
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,410
我認真的  吉米
I mean it, Jimmy.

735
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,080
不會再有了
You won't.
