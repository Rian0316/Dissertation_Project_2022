1
00:00:00,592 --> 00:00:02,365
Previously on "The Originals"...

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,694
I assume I have the misfortune

3
00:00:03,696 --> 00:00:04,861
of speaking to my mother.

4
00:00:05,163 --> 00:00:06,563
I have come to heal our family.

5
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,829
She'd prefer to place us all in new bodies.

6
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:10,198
Take the body of a mortal

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,500
and all be happy again.

8
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,435
It is time you bring Camille in.

9
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:15,103
There's no need for this.

10
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:17,906
My sons have taken quite the liking to you.

11
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,674
[Chanting]

12
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:22,444
Proud werewolves on a witch's leash.

13
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:24,446
I hope those rings you're
wearing are worth it.

14
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:26,448
You're gonna like me, Davina Claire,

15
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,216
and I'm gonna let you pretend a while

16
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:29,885
that you don't already.

17
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:31,686
Esther: When he wakes,
he'll make his own decision.

18
00:00:31,688 --> 00:00:35,056
Klaus: You declared war when
you came after my family.

19
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:36,658
You don't understand.

20
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,360
Slap them on a witch,

21
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:39,728
can't do magic as long as they're on.

22
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,796
Kidnapping. Rather unpleasant way

23
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:43,064
to begin a family reunion.

24
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,533
Well, wait until you see how we end it.

25
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:51,906
[Child giggling]

26
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:56,044
Klaus: We arrive into
this world as innocents,

27
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:58,079
wide-eyed,

28
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:00,148
vulnerable.

29
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,053
It is the job of our parents
to nurture and protect us.

30
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:08,890
Unfortunately, our own
parents failed miserably

31
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:12,493
at even the most basic of parental tasks,

32
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:14,729
but we are not beholden to the past

33
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,465
they created for us.

34
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:21,369
Today, a new future awaits.

35
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:24,672
Forget your animosity
toward Elijah and myself,

36
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:28,242
and instead join us against she who truly

37
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:32,513
deserves your ire... our mother.

38
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:37,251
Do this, and we will
welcome you with open arms.

39
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:43,157
But if you continue to oppose us,

40
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,260
a denial of pastries will be
the least of your concerns.

41
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,429
If you all you wanted was my
allegiance against mother dearest,

42
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:50,431
you should have said so,

43
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,466
save me a night shackled to the wall.

44
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:54,068
This was Niklaus.

45
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,103
My recommendation was to remove

46
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:58,806
your limbs one by one until you comply.

47
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:03,144
Heh. We've... we've no
desire to torture you,

48
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:07,248
provided you vow to stand beside us

49
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,582
as brothers.

50
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:10,317
Brothers?

51
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,219
Does that word even apply to us

52
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:14,488
after all these centuries of betrayal,

53
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,826
and is loyalty to you ever really rewarded?

54
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:22,930
If so, tell me Niklaus,

55
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:26,567
where is our sister Rebekah?

56
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:29,336
She was blindly loyal to
you for a thousand years,

57
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:34,174
and now nowhere to be found.

58
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:36,643
Where did our sister go,

59
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:40,280
and how did she escape
your vile machinations?

60
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:42,282
Heh.

61
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:45,185
You think me vile?

62
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,920
Well, what then, do you make

63
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:48,422
of the one who cursed us?

64
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:50,490
She was trying to make you mortal again,

65
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:54,127
and you both refused her.

66
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,764
Only proves how far you've fallen,

67
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:00,467
but I expect Rebekah will
have a different response

68
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:02,536
to her proposal.

69
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,305
See, unlike the two of you,

70
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:07,340
she always did cling to her humanity.

71
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:08,942
Rebekah's off limits, too.

72
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:11,812
You pursue her, and you will suffer.

73
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:14,514
Klaus: Do not let him goad you, Elijah.

74
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,483
Neither he nor Esther will find Rebekah

75
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:19,186
unless she wants to be
found, and she does not.

76
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:22,622
Esther is quite determined.

77
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,357
She's been searching for Rebekah

78
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,293
since the day she returned.

79
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:28,528
[Birds fluttering, screeching]

80
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:37,037
I imagine it's only a matter of time.

81
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:50,717
I enjoy a good bloodletting
as much as anyone,

82
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,853
but our brothers have power,

83
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,421
as well as knowledge of Esther's plans.

84
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:57,156
We need them alive.

85
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,760
Can you imagine what they
would do to Rebekah, to Hope?

86
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,763
Rebekah has been cloaked by powerful magic.

87
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,201
Focus on the task at hand.

88
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:10,603
We need to persuade our brothers.

89
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,672
I'm through with persuasion.

90
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:16,042
Has the earth shifted on its axis,

91
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:19,412
you needing restraint from me?

92
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:22,850
[Cell phone ringing]

93
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:26,172
It's me. I have the baby,
and we're on the run.

94
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:27,473
Esther found us.

95
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,675
We're safe for now.

96
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,109
I've lost her bloody starlings,

97
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:31,310
but I have no idea where to go.

98
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,678
Tell her to head west.

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,980
I'll call Hayley.

100
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,181
Do not tell Hayley.

101
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:36,416
Esther's too smart for that.

102
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:37,917
The only advantage that we have is that

103
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,019
she thinks the baby died.

104
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:41,854
Text me with plans.

105
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,124
Go. I'll take care of Kol and Finn.

106
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,827
Splendid, and in your hands, I
assume they'll be dead by nightfall.

107
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,962
I will show restraint.
Hope needs her father.

108
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:52,832
What she needs, what...

109
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,002
what we need are allies to
help us defeat our mother.

110
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,104
Finn and Kol must be turned to our side.

111
00:04:58,106 --> 00:05:00,806
Without their help, there will
be nowhere left for Hope to run.

112
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:02,008
Klaus, you child.

113
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,242
I have waited months

114
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:06,212
to see my daughter.

115
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,414
I can wait one more day.

116
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:13,285
Elijah.

117
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:16,755
Do whatever it takes to keep her safe.

118
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:18,724
I give you my word.

119
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,196
Wolves are freaking out.

120
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,531
They know it had to be an insider

121
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,132
who took down Vincent last night,

122
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,467
seeing as no one could
have been anywhere near him.

123
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,102
Anybody suspect it was you?

124
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:32,037
No, not yet, but they're
gonna figure it out,

125
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,472
which pretty much means I'm screwed

126
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,675
unless we come up with a plan.

127
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:40,012
Call a meeting, the whole pack tonight.

128
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:41,880
If they're so scared,
now's the perfect time

129
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,916
to convince them they need to ditch Esther.

130
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,384
She gave them moonlight rings.

131
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,219
Well, those rings make you slaves.

132
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,587
No. They make us powerful.

133
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:49,822
We were exiles before,

134
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:51,023
but now we run the city.

135
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:52,224
The vampires are scared of us,

136
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,492
and no one, including me is just

137
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:54,726
gonna walk away from that because...

138
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:57,129
set the damn meeting.

139
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,576
So are you gonna work on a rousing speech

140
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:13,078
or just get day drunk?

141
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,413
Little bit of both.

142
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,882
Jack, it's 10 A.M.

143
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:31,643
You know, for months, I wrote
down every single word Ansel said,

144
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:34,446
the entire history of our people.

145
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:35,814
If only I'd know he was Klaus' father,

146
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:38,216
I would have asked him
a hell of a lot more.

147
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:42,287
You know, I was up all
night looking through this,

148
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,389
trying to find something, anything

149
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,623
that will help me figure out how to get

150
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,158
the people back together.

151
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:51,329
Let me guess... no such luck.

152
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,098
Nothing viable.

153
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,302
And now Ansel's dead

154
00:06:57,304 --> 00:07:00,371
along with Ollie, so forgive me

155
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:02,040
if I need a beer because right now,

156
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:04,175
I can use all the help I can get.

157
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:17,054
Davina: I screwed up, you guys.

158
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:18,790
I was with Kaleb last night,

159
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:22,560
and he took the white oak
stake when I was asleep.

160
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:24,595
I... I'm sorry. I never
should have trusted him.

161
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:26,864
Kol doesn't have the stake.

162
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:29,033
Klaus does. Matter of fact,

163
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:31,102
Klaus has Kol, too.

164
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:33,838
What? How is that possible?

165
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
D, I'm the one who took him.

166
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:38,709
I saw an opportunity, and
I wasn't gonna pass it up,

167
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:42,613
and trust me... we are all safer this way.

168
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:45,382
Not Kaleb. Klaus will kill him.

169
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:47,852
His name isn't Kaleb. It's Kol,

170
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:49,787
and Klaus has had a
thousand years to kill him,

171
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:51,489
and he hasn't, so worry less about him

172
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:52,890
and more about yourself.

173
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:54,925
All right. This guy is not your friend.

174
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,394
He wants to use you to get his own way.

175
00:07:57,396 --> 00:07:59,029
You don't know him like I do.

176
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,332
I know him better than you do.

177
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:08,472
Now I'm sorry I had to go behind your back,

178
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:09,840
and I hate lying to you, I really do,

179
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:12,242
but believe me, this is for your own good.

180
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:14,011
I got to take care of
some business, all right?

181
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:16,013
Stick with Josh.

182
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,750
Everything's gonna be ok.

183
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:26,256
Elijah's off his bloody rocker.

184
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:29,960
We need to get out of here.

185
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:33,397
Are you gonna help me or what?

186
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,665
If you were a little more clever,

187
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,933
you would recognize that there's

188
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:38,101
opportunity in our current circumstances.

189
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:40,404
Opportunity to what, get a beating?

190
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:43,273
Gentlemen, I apologize
for keeping you waiting.

191
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,509
Good news is I have
returned with an old friend,

192
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:49,146
someone who wants to say hello.

193
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:51,481
Hello.

194
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:52,783
How's it going, fellas?

195
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:54,818
Ah, you again. You ever get bored

196
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,020
of getting bullied by my brother?

197
00:08:57,022 --> 00:08:58,522
Oh, I volunteered for this.

198
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:00,123
- Did you?
- Yeah. The way I see it,

199
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,291
you have it coming.

200
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:03,360
First, you messed with Davina.

201
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:06,396
Now I hear you want to
drag Rebekah into all this.

202
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,164
Uh-uh. Not happening.

203
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,434
Well, I'd prefer you both to
join me against our mother,

204
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,703
but I'll happily settle
for one or the other.

205
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:16,506
Either way, if you continue to defy me,

206
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,508
your lives will be reduced
to an unending sequence

207
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,378
of agonizing torture.

208
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,014
So...

209
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:25,749
Which is it to be?

210
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,902
I've got to say I'm gonna enjoy this.

211
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:38,371
Out of the whole twisted
family... sit down...

212
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:40,607
you are the one that I like the least.

213
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,722
Yeah? Well, there's a pretty young lady

214
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:44,758
who disagrees with that opinion.

215
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,060
Then let me make myself perfectly clear.

216
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:48,661
You go near Davina, and I'm
gonna cut off parts of you

217
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:49,863
that you'd rather keep.

218
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:52,932
Ahh. More threats. How bloody inventive.

219
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,602
Thing is, Klaus needs me,

220
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:58,071
so that backs you into a
bit of a corner, doesn't it?

221
00:09:58,073 --> 00:09:59,839
Well, until we get rid of your mom.

222
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,908
I wonder what happens then.

223
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,676
Well, Klaus might not
need me when mother's gone,

224
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,714
but you might.

225
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:10,363
Come on, Marcel. You were
king of the city once.

226
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:13,366
You really think he's just
gonna give it back to you?

227
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:19,772
You always got an angle, don't you?

228
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:22,341
You see, individually,
we can't do anything,

229
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:26,748
but together, well, Klaus
wouldn't stand a chance.

230
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,585
Probably not, but then
I'd have to trust you,

231
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:34,320
and I don't.

232
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:38,524
At least with Klaus, I know
exactly what I'm getting.

233
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:41,327
I thought you had more
fortitude, Marcellus.

234
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:43,262
You disappoint me.

235
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:47,500
Nobody cares for your opinion.

236
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:51,003
Klaus just wants to know what you're up to.

237
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:54,507
Tell me everything,
maybe you'll get to live.

238
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,009
If not...

239
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,444
Aah!

240
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,414
Josh: For the record, yes, I knew what

241
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,516
Marcel was up to, and you
can hate me if you want to...

242
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,085
I don't hate you, Josh.

243
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:08,587
I'm just sick of worrying about you

244
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:10,356
and Marcel, and most of all,

245
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:13,325
I am tired of Klaus always
being in the middle of it.

246
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:15,461
You know, every time I
try to stand up to him...

247
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:18,430
it hasn't worked out so well.

248
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah. Well, failure, party of two.

249
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:24,570
You seem to be doing all right.

250
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:28,407
Uh, yeah, except that every werewolf
in town is trying to kill me.

251
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:32,477
Well, except for the superhot
one that I'm sort of dating,

252
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,079
but that's got its own problems, though.

253
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:37,582
It's kind of a, uh, Romeo and Romeo thing.

254
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:40,619
And how hot is this Romeo?

255
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:42,154
Well...

256
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:46,491
Pretty hot!

257
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:47,959
Definitely worth the drama.

258
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:51,530
Yeah.

259
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:54,166
Invite him over.

260
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:57,169
Yeah. I want to meet him.

261
00:11:57,571 --> 00:12:00,172
Come on. Do it.

262
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:01,940
[Humming]

263
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:04,709
Do you think our mother
is even the least bit

264
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:07,812
concerned for your well-being?

265
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,548
She knows I don't need rescuing.

266
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,452
Hmm? Ehh.

267
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:16,288
You can toy with me all you want, Niklaus,

268
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,491
but you've had innumerable
opportunities to kill me.

269
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:21,862
But I didn't, did I?

270
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:27,133
Finn, I understand your devotion to her.

271
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,369
She must have clung to
you with desperate need

272
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:32,871
after our sister Freya died,

273
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:34,839
making you believe

274
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,876
it was your responsibility to care for her

275
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,645
always and forever, hmm,

276
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:44,349
a burden which you
accepted without question

277
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:47,952
because you were a good son.

278
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:55,526
Small children lack the capacity
to question their parents,

279
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:57,697
but you're a man now, Finn.

280
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:02,956
Is that the extent of your argument?

281
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,795
I'm a man now, so I should
join your wretched cause?

282
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:11,298
Is it not better to join me

283
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
than spend the remainder
of your mortal life

284
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:16,403
aligned to a woman who
always manipulated you?

285
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:20,707
Brother, I offer you the
opportunity to free yourself.

286
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,744
Side with me, and I will give you

287
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,912
the life she never once offered,

288
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:29,917
a chance to choose your own path.

289
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,652
The choice is yours, brother.

290
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,626
Hayley: You want to
stop playing mountain man

291
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:41,962
and explain why you kept this from me?

292
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,330
[Sighs]

293
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:45,332
Why don't I jog your memory?

294
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,967
"The werewolf's power can be traced back

295
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:49,536
to the myth of the unification ceremony,

296
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,372
a ritual that bestowed
certain unique abilities

297
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:56,242
onto every member of the pack."

298
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:57,977
Do you believe this?

299
00:13:57,979 --> 00:14:00,346
I didn't at first,

300
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:02,615
and then Ansel swore he
saw it with his own eyes,

301
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:04,017
and then he dies, and I find out he's

302
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,319
resurrected from a thousand years ago,

303
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,688
which means he was alive to see it.

304
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,623
How did I not know about this?

305
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,292
You didn't grow up out here.

306
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:14,193
Every kid grows up hearing the stories.

307
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:18,464
Back in the day, werewolf
bloodlines were all distinct, right?

308
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,533
Some had speed, some had strength,

309
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:23,403
some could sense enemies from miles away.

310
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,774
Now to evolve, you would perform a ritual.

311
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:31,244
A shaman would marry the
alphas of each bloodline,

312
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,045
and then the special abilities of each

313
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:36,816
would be inherited mystically

314
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:39,652
by everyone who participated in the ritual.

315
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:41,487
See, after a few centuries, everybody had

316
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,856
the same abilities, so Alpha
marriages became political.

317
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:48,995
They became about power, about territory.

318
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:51,764
But I have a unique ability.

319
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:55,735
Because I'm a hybrid, I
can control when I change,

320
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:58,604
so if this mystical marriage thing works,

321
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,840
then our people get my power,

322
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:02,475
and they can ditch the rings,

323
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:06,979
which means Esther no
longer has a hold over them.

324
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:11,850
Jack, this is exactly the answer
that we've been looking for.

325
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:13,586
Let's find a shaman, we'll say some vows.

326
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:15,454
Hell, we'll make it a party.

327
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,825
It ain't just a party.

328
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:23,228
If the vows ain't honored, it doesn't work.

329
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:27,966
It's got to be a real marriage in every way

330
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,403
for the rest of our lives.

331
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:33,172
Are you up for that?

332
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,142
Uh...

333
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,315
Didn't think so.

334
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:54,943
[Cell phone vibrating]

335
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,451
Hayley, hey. What's up?

336
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:04,986
I need a favor.

337
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,277
Are you sure you're ok?

338
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,547
Yeah. I must just be
coming down with something.

339
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:14,348
I'm sorry to drag you out of bed for this.

340
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,751
Please. You just discovered
an ancient marriage ritual

341
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:19,654
with pretty drastic supernatural
and personal implications.

342
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:22,890
The least I could do is get out of bed.

343
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:25,826
So this is everything I found
in my uncle's files about

344
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:28,062
werewolf ceremonies and rituals.

345
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:30,831
Mostly it sounds like
old folklore and fables.

346
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:36,837
But I'm guessing you're not here
looking for some kind of proof.

347
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,773
I don't know what I'm looking for.

348
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:43,577
Not to pry, but does
Jackson have any answers?

349
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,446
He doesn't even want to talk about it.

350
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,715
He doesn't even want to
put me in this position.

351
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:51,151
He's a good, decent guy,

352
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:54,188
if those even exist anymore.

353
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,358
And I'm assuming he knows about Elijah.

354
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,693
Elijah and I have barely spoken

355
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:02,730
since I became a hybrid,

356
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,865
but still he is...

357
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,000

00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,499
You got a problem with that?

539
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:36,669
Hayley: I want to hear
what Jackson has to say.

540
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:38,838
This is a pack meeting.

541
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,473
You're not one of us anymore.

542
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,975
No?

543
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,121
I am still a wolf,

544
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:59,391
and I didn't need any magical rings

545
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:03,128
to control when or how I change.

546
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,566
You want the same? Then sit down, shut up,

547
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:09,401
and listen.

548
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,174
Klaus: You forget yourself.

549
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:18,243
You're not as powerful as you once were,

550
00:30:18,245 --> 00:30:20,145
harvest girl.

551
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:23,081
Doesn't mean I can't still kick your ass.

552
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:42,734
Such hubris,

553
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:46,204
and from one who bleeds so easily.

554
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:49,708
Unh.

555
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,978
You talk such a big game,

556
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,048
but you couldn't even kill
Mikael when you had the chance.

557
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,451
He was right about you, you know?

558
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:02,253
You're weak.

559
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:03,922
Aah!

560
00:31:03,924 --> 00:31:05,490
Aah!

561
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,992
[Gagging]

562
00:31:23,254 --> 00:31:25,989
It's impressive.

563
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:27,824
What exactly did you do to him?

564
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:31,194
Channeled dark objects,
turned my blood to poison.

565
00:31:31,196 --> 00:31:33,096
How did you get free?

566
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:35,198
Oh, it's a long story. Better question is

567
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,734
if he's not dead, then what are
you gonna do when he recovers?

568
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:39,069
We have an hour, maybe less,

569
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,303
enough time to chain him, bleed him,

570
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:41,638
dump him in the river.

571
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,073
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

572
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:45,142
Since when do you care
what happens to Klaus?

573
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,477
[Marcel groans]

574
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:51,114
Kol is with us now.

575
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:52,783
We're gonna be going up against Esther,

576
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,685
assuming Klaus is upright.

577
00:31:55,687 --> 00:31:58,255
Look. Nik... he's a pain in the ass,

578
00:31:58,257 --> 00:32:00,323
but, well, she's a problem for us all.

579
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:01,858
Klaus is the problem.

580
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,293
I don't give a damn what happens to Esther.

581
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:05,495
Cami: Yeah? Well, I sure do.

582
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:09,432
Should I even ask?

583
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:11,468
Cami, you should go. It's not safe.

584
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,303
No kidding. I woke up with puncture wounds

585
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:15,171
all up and down my spine and no idea

586
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:16,339
how they got there.

587
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:17,674
According to my uncle's files,

588
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:18,875
they're a part of this ancient spell,

589
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:20,276
and I don't know about you guys,

590
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:21,644
but when I see "ancient" and "spell"

591
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:23,079
in the same sentence,

592
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:26,783
I think Esther.

593
00:32:26,785 --> 00:32:29,652
Hayley: You all need help, and you know it.

594
00:32:29,654 --> 00:32:32,088
Now whatever it is that you think of me,

595
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,957
I was born a Crescent.

596
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:36,192
I'm the last of the Labonair line,

597
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:38,228
which makes me an Alpha.

598
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,264
Jackson is your Alpha.

599
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:44,701
Now I don't know how many of you
bought the story you grew up with,

600
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:47,737
the unification myth.

601
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:50,175
Well, it is all true.

602
00:32:52,177 --> 00:32:57,513
Which means if Jackson and I get married,

603
00:32:57,515 --> 00:33:00,049
anyone with the guts to
turn up to the ceremony

604
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:03,452
has as much control over
their wolf form as I do.

605
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,488
[Indistinct chatter]

606
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,889
Hayley, what are you doing?

607
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:08,724
What needs to be done.

608
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:16,732
This isn't just about uniting our pack.

609
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:19,769
It's about forming a new community.

610
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:25,241
This ceremony will
change everything for us.

611
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:29,645
It will give us the strength
we need to defend ourselves.

612
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:34,250
Then and only then will
we finally have peace.

613
00:33:37,888 --> 00:33:40,689
The choice is yours.

614
00:33:40,691 --> 00:33:43,425
Keep the rings and be somebody's bitch,

615
00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:47,963
or be part of the greatest
pack that ever lived.

616
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:00,776
I'm in.

617
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,681
[Clatter]

618
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:13,055
Yeah, that's mum's work all right.

619
00:34:13,057 --> 00:34:15,057
She must have wiped your memory.

620
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,591
Not the first time that's been done

621
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:17,859
by a member of this family.

622
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:19,261
What does it mean?

623
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:21,964
It's a byproduct of a preparation spell.

624
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:23,598
Preparation for what?

625
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,002
To make her a vessel.

626
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:29,771
He means Esther prepared your body

627
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:32,007
for someone to jump into.

628
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:35,078
Likely herself. I mean, knowing mother.

629
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,282
Where's Vincent?

630
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:41,783
[Footsteps]

631
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:50,527
Why me out of everyone in this city?

632
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:54,429
Because you're perfect...

633
00:34:54,431 --> 00:35:00,035
healthy, beautiful, smart, and alone.

634
00:35:00,037 --> 00:35:03,471
No one would question
any personality changes,

635
00:35:03,473 --> 00:35:05,773
and as I discovered from our sessions,

636
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:07,242
Niklaus would never allow you to be harmed.

637
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:08,710
Fix this.

638
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:10,211
Do something to stop it.

639
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:12,780
I can't. Only my mother can.

640
00:35:12,782 --> 00:35:14,382
I will step in front of a moving truck

641
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:17,888
before I let your mother take over my body.

642
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,057
She wasn't preparing you for herself, Cami.

643
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:26,094
She was preparing you for Rebekah.

644
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,676
[Hope crying]

645
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:45,546
Well, she is all sorted
and ready for an adventure.

646
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:47,515
Aren't you, luv?

647
00:35:52,888 --> 00:35:56,424
It's difficult to believe we
were all this innocent once.

648
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:02,296
We mustn't let the world ever hurt her.

649
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:08,102
You're right. We mustn't.

650
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:09,603
[Crack]

651
00:36:19,854 --> 00:36:21,355
How long do I have?

652
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:24,841
Well, now that Esther knows
where Rebekah's hiding, not long.

653
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:28,195
The only way to stop it is to stop her.

654
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:31,744
Then let's do this.

655
00:36:31,746 --> 00:36:32,911
Marcel's a vampire,

656
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:34,546
you both are powerful witches.

657
00:36:34,548 --> 00:36:36,582
Esther's stronger than
anything I've ever seen.

658
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:38,584
We go up against her,

659
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:40,452
we're gonna need Klaus.

660
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:43,689
No. No. We can do this without him.

661
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:46,091
I'm never gonna say this again,

662
00:36:46,093 --> 00:36:47,759
but Marcel's right.

663
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:51,096
We do need the bastard.

664
00:36:51,098 --> 00:36:53,398
Davina...

665
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,968
I know this is asking a lot,

666
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,903
but please.

667
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:15,420
[Chanting]

668

670
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:24,863
What did you do to me?

671
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:27,866
All you need to know is
that I beat you again.

672
00:37:27,868 --> 00:37:30,101
And yet you relented,

673
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:32,037
which means you need me.

674
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,772
Did I really lose?

675
00:37:39,478 --> 00:37:42,046
I'm sorry I sprung that on you.

676
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:47,485
You know, I always thought it
would be me popping the question

677
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,988
instead of being the one put on the spot.

678
00:37:54,627 --> 00:37:57,028
Are you sure you want to do this?

679
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,897
Are you?

680
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:08,306
Look. I knw you're only
doing this to help our people,

681
00:38:08,308 --> 00:38:12,977
but I promise I will be
a good husband to you.

682
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:30,863
Hayley Marshall, will you marry me?

683
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:38,669
No ring?

684
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:43,741
Heh heh.

685
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:57,888
Quite nice of you coming
to my rescue like that.

686
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,557
You know, it's a good thing
you didn't actually steal

687
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,158
the stake from me,

688
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,893
or I'd have been the one torturing you.

689
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:04,795
That mean you trust me now?

690
00:39:07,232 --> 00:39:08,899
Klaus: Provided you're not busy concocting

691
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:10,734
a new paralytic to use against me,

692
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:12,569
I'd like a word with my brother.

693
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:15,272
Well, to be honest, I can't
stand being around you anyway.

694
00:39:18,042 --> 00:39:20,177
For the record, didn't know a bloody thing

695
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:23,847
about mother's plan for Cami, I swear.

696
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:25,616
Well, I think I can judge for myself

697
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:27,384
which of her schemes
she would entrust to you

698
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:29,753
and which she would not.

699
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:33,290
I believe this was Finn's task.

700
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:35,259
And where, pray tell, is he now?

701
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:36,693
He's waiting uncomfortably for me

702
00:39:36,695 --> 00:39:38,428
to return and deliver his punishment.

703
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,098
Pass the beignets, would you?

704
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,066
Now it's only a matter
of time before mother

705
00:39:43,068 --> 00:39:46,303
gets bored of waiting for you to let us go.

706
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:48,939
Well, Finn at least.

707
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:53,510
Don't expect she'd care
if I never came home.

708
00:39:53,512 --> 00:39:58,081
A mother cares for her
children, a monster does not.

709
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,750
Once you accept she is the latter,

710
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:02,319
you'll stop expecting the former.

711
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:07,758
And despite what you might think, Kol,

712
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,127
I did mourn you after your death,

713
00:40:11,129 --> 00:40:13,330
and I did attempt to avenge you.

714
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:18,034
I would do nothing less
because we are brothers

00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:27,877
Excuse me.

718
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:31,614
Where have you been?

719
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:33,450
Rebekah: Nik, it's me. Something's wrong.

720
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:35,685
Elijah slaughtered a dozen
people whose only sin was

721
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:37,487
their terrible taste in food.

722
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:38,988
I mean, when have you known him to kill

723
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,523
when he can otherwise compel?

724
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,058
It's the kind of act that will draw

725
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,594
our mother's attention.

726
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:48,298
Her torture must have affected
him more deeply than I realized.

727
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,465
Where is he now?

728
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:51,300
I broke his neck to keep us safe,

729
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:54,804
but I have no clue what to do next.

730
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:56,339
Do you recall where we dined

731
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:57,974
the Christmas after we fled Mikael?

732
00:40:57,976 --> 00:40:59,175
Of course.

733
00:40:59,177 --> 00:41:00,843
Go there now.

734
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:04,147
If you enjoyed last night's activities,

735
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:06,149
then you're in for a treat.

736
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:07,550
Klaus, listen to me. Our mother...

737
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,519
Not another word.

738
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:12,121
No more fairytales about witches an curses.

739
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:16,025
If it's a fairytale, then why
do I see fear in your eyes?

740
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:17,326
Marcel!

741
00:41:17,328 --> 00:41:19,261
Bring it in.

742
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:20,763
No.

743
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:24,934
No, Niklaus.

744
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:26,135
Oh, don't worry, brother.

745
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:29,004
I made some air holes, small ones.

746
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:31,707
Aah! Aah!

747
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:34,543
[Music playing]

748
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:40,049
Klaus, have you seen Elijah?

749
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:42,017
There's something I need to tell you both.

750
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:43,319
You can tell me on the way.

751
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:45,421
What? Where are we going?

752
00:41:48,525 --> 00:41:50,826
To see our daughter.

753
