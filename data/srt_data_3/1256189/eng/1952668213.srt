1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:03,882
I am not impressed
with the talent in here tonight.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:06,509
And the more I drink,
the less attractive they get.

3
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:10,263
I'm one scotch and soda away
from the Cantina scene in <i>Star Wars.</i>

4
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:12,682
What about those girls over there?
They're hot.

5
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,563
- They're not hot.
- Are you kidding?

6
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:16,858
I hated their guts
the second I saw them.

7
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,302
Which means they're hot.

8
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:21,108
In fact, I hated them almost
as much as I hated Robin

9
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,443
when I first met her.

10
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:24,212
- You hated me?
- A lot.

11
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:28,073
Barney, they're hot.

12
00:00:28,844 --> 00:00:30,909
There is so much to teach you all.

13
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,495
You have just become victims of...

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,331
"the Cheerleader Effect".
Glad you asked.

15
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:39,820
The Cheerleader Effect is
when group of women seems hot

16
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:41,628
but only as a group.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,487
Just like with cheerleaders.
They seem hot,

18
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,829
but take each one
of them individually?

19
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:48,134
Sled dogs.

20
00:00:48,405 --> 00:00:49,469
That's insane.

21
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,013
Take a good,
hard look at each one of those girls.

22
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:53,650
Individually.

23
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:15,161
I don't know.
The one on the end is kind of cute.

24
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:16,922
Yeah, she really is.

25
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:20,017
And that, my friends,
is "The Cheerleader Effect".

26
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:22,629
Also known
as the Bridesmaid Paradox,

27
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,383
Sorority Girl Syndrome,

28
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,386
and for a brief window
in the mid-'90s,

29
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:28,468
the Spice Girls Conspiracy.

30
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:30,010
Scary Spice indeed.

31
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:35,972
Barney Stinson.

32
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,527
Okay. Got it.

33
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:44,011
Great, we'll be in touch.

34
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:47,766
What?

35
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,427
Apparently, I'm gonna be a dad.

36
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:55,048
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

37
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:08,130
You're gonna be a dad?
How did this happen?

38
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:11,459
It was just some girl I hook up
with a few weeks back.

39
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,053
She's not sure. She's gonna go
to the doctor in the morning.

40
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,682
Maybe it's a false alarm.
Maybe she's not pregnant.

41
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:21,531
No part of Barney Stinson does
anything less than 110%.

42
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:24,565
If one of my little Michael Phelpses
got loose, he's swimming for the gold.

43
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:27,900
Oh, this is a nightmare.
I don't want kids.

44
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,671
Who in their right mind
would ever want kids?

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,517
<i>Now, when you turn 30
and you're in a couple,</i>

46
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:34,950
<i>a strange thing happens.</i>

47
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,859
<i>You start to see babies everywhere.</i>

48
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,711
Oh, come on.

49
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:56,597
<i>Yes, Marshall and Lily
were coming down with baby fever.</i>

50
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:58,432
<i>Their new neighbor weren't helping.</i>

51
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:00,684
Did you lose a sock there,
little dude?

52
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,031
That is without a doubt

53
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:06,565
the cutest little thing
I've ever seen.

54
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:08,190
There's my little peanut.

55
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:10,277
<i>That night they sat down
to have a serious</i>

56
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,154
<i>practical discussion
about having kids.</i>

57
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,366
So, if we have a baby,

58
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:16,767
do you think you could
work fewer hours?

59
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:20,953
Doesn't matter, he's gonna be so cute,
I'm gonna eat him up on the first day.

60
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:25,709
Okay. But what about money?
We're still in a ton of debt.

61
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:29,296
We'll count our overdue bills
on his teenie tiny fingers.

62
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:31,882
Let's have a baby.

63
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,473
Oh, oh, right now? Oh, okay.

64
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,932
<i>There was just one thing
in their way.</i>

65
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:43,684
Scooch over. I TiVo'd <i>The View.</i>

66
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:49,311
<i>And that thing happened to be unemployed
and sleeping on their couch.</i>

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,592
So, Robin,

68
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,496
how's the job and
apartment search going?

69
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:00,178
You didn't hear?
I'm the lead anchor on CNN.

70
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:03,704
And I got a penthouse
overlooking Central Park made of gold.

71
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,500
Get your head out
of your ass, Marshall.

72
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:09,503
<i>They realized if they were
going to start a family.</i>

73
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,252
<i>They had to plan ahead.</i>

74
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,983
So, Robin, would you mind crashing
at Ted's tomorrow night?

75
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:18,427
I'm... cooking Marshall
a special dinner.

76
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,429
Just dinner. That's it.
Nothing else.

77
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:24,391
Fine. But you'd better not be
as uptight as these idiots

78
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,461
about me shooting beer cans
on the roof.

79
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:28,834
"It hurt my ears.

80
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,316
"The neighbors called the cops.
You almost hit me."

81
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,568
Enjoy her, Ted.
She's in a real good place right now.

82
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:41,154
God? It's me. Barney.

83
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:42,868
What up?

84
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,038
I know we don't talk much,

85
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:49,255
though a lot of girls call out
your name because of me.

86
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,364
Awesome.

87
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:52,337
But, God...

88
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:56,255
If you could get me out of this,

89
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,766
I swear I will never ever,

90
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:02,471
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever...

91
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,395
Oh, hang on, bro.

92
00:05:09,836 --> 00:05:11,080
Go for Barney.

93
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,318
Really?

94
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:28,205
Great news! I'm not a father!

95
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,575
Congratulations, buddy.

96
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,170
This is the happiest moment
of my life, Marshall.

97
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,325
The way I feel
about not having kids?

98
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,842
I never knew I could love
something this much.

99
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:41,762
That's why I'm creating a holiday.

100
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:46,265
From now on, today will be known
as "Not a Father's Day."

101
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:48,677
- You're creating a holiday?
- Why not?

102
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:52,062
Everyone else gets a day:
mothers, fathers, bastilles.

103
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:55,691
Why can't there be a day for people
who are single and like it that way?

104
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,235
Now you just sound like
the chubby girl on Valentine's Day.

105
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:01,511
- Hello, Stinson.
- Hey, Nolan. How are the kids?

106
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,827
You ready for tonight, Eriksen?
Big merger.

107
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:10,086
That's between me and my wife, sir.

108
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,626
The meeting with Mr. Li. Tonight.

109
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,503
I thought
that was a breakfast meeting.

110
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:17,339
It is. Breakfast in China.
We're teleconferencing with the Chinese.

111
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,389
I'm counting on you, kid.

112
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:25,140
- Marshall?
- Hey, babe.

113
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:28,511
- It's breakfast time in China.
- Yeah, it is.

114
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:31,005
Not a euphemism. Look, I...

115
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,299
- Wait, what would that even mean?
- I don't know, hot buns, spicy pork?

116
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:36,993
There's something there.

117
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:39,401
You're not coming home tonight,
are you?

118
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,447
Are you shaking your head "no"?

119
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,713
I thought so.

120
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:50,539
Thank you, guys,
for coming over so fast.

121
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,748
Are you all right?
You sounded upset on the phone.

122
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:56,030
Marshall and I made
this big decision to have...

123
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,338
dinner. And I thought

124
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,003
I was ready to have... dinner.

125
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,301
But then he called and canceled,

126
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:07,180
and it got me thinking.
Is it too early for us to have...

127
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:08,682
dinner?

128
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:11,016
I had an early lunch,
so I'm ready for dinner.

129
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:13,885
- Dinner is a baby!
- Lily, that's horrible!

130
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,065
No, no, I need you guys to figure
something out for me.

131
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,191
What?

132
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:22,237
Are Marshall and I ready
to have a baby?

133
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:29,785
So, are Marshall and I ready
to have a baby or not?

134
00:07:30,587 --> 00:07:33,583
Lily, we can't make this
decision for you. It's huge.

135
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,924
You know what else is huge?
Marshall's head.

136
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:38,504
That thing's the size
of a late August watermelon.

137
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,831
Marshall's baby coming
through there?

138
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:44,970
- What does Marshall think?
- Probably a lot

139
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:47,679
in that 1950s space helmet
of a head he's walking around with.

140
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:50,870
Marshall really excited.

141
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:53,684
But I think he only sees what's
cute about having a baby,

142
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,144
not what's hard about it.

143
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,387
<i>Like the other day, while
Marshall was playing with baby Jeremy,</i>

144
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,139
<i>I was talking to Jeremy's mom.</i>

145
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:03,038
Thanks so much for inviting us over.
I have not talked to another adult in,

146
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:05,056
like, weeks. Besides my husband.

147
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,386
But "It's your turn to change him"
and "Make him shut up"

148
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,239
really doesn't count
as conversation.

149
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,893
Sorry, I'm rambling.
I haven't gotten laid in seven months.

150
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:14,623
I just did it again!
Sleep deprivation!

151
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,500
Oh, wait, I'm not crying, am I?
I usually am.

152
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,004
I don't mean to complain.
Now I feel bad!

153
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,465
There's my little peanut!

154
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,759
Oh, I love you so much!

155
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,714
I'm going to be as strung out
as Charlotte.

156
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,154
Worse actually.

157
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,250
At least her husband works
from home.

158
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,559
I mean, he's a pot dealer,
but he's a very involved parent.

159
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:39,346
- Marshall will be a great dad.
- Marshall's always at the office,

160
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,605
and I'm afraid that
if we have a baby now,

161
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,193
all the work will fall on me.

162
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,849
You're just panicking
and focusing on the downside.

163
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,031
I think Lily's just being realistic.

164
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:51,368
See, this is good. This is why
I called you guys both over here.

165
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,339
Ted, you're pro kids.
Robin, you're against.

166
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,580
Counselors, opening statements.

167
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,054
Okay, I know you're afraid
that you're not ready.

168
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,852
But no one ever thinks
they're ready.

169
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:04,558
You just have to take the leap.
Parenthood will come naturally.

170
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:06,571
Of course you think
it comes naturally.

171
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:10,053
- You're basically a dad already.
- You're a total dad.

172
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:12,764
- What are you talking about?
- Ted, think about it.

173
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,862
<i>You tell super corny dad jokes.</i>

174
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:17,464
Shredded tweet!

175
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:21,774
Shredded tweet!

176
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,276
<i>You lecture us. Like when we broke
your stupid ship in a bottle.</i>

177
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:28,904
I'm not angry.
I'm just disappointed.

178
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,700
- She did it!
- Shut up!

179
00:09:33,502 --> 00:09:36,464
<i>And you do that thing all dads
do with waitresses.</i>

180
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:39,249
Hi, I'm Lori.
I'll be your waitress this evening.

181
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,711
Hi, Lori, I'm Ted.
I'll be your customer this evening.

182
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:44,960
Hey, Lori, before you go, tell me,

183
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,674
what do you get when you cross
a canary with a lawn mower? No hints.

184
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:52,830
She's right.
You maybe single and childless,

185
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:54,930
but you're totally a dorky dad.

186
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:58,815
I don't think I like your tone,
young lady.

187
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,561
Not a Father's Day is a hit!

188
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,982
Laraby and Finklestein are helping me
celebrate. Check it.

189
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,359
"World's Greatest Not A Dad" mugs.

190
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,419
There's...

191
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:11,364
"Who's Not Your Daddy?" t-shirts.

192
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,747
Both available
at Not-A-Father's-Day.com.

193
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,189
Check out the greeting cards.

194
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:23,626
"For everything you do for yourself,
For all the scotch upon your shelf,

195
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:27,269
"Your Porsche Carrera rules the freeway,
Here's wishing you

196
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:30,632
"an all night three-way.
Happy Not a Father's Day."

197
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,024
Check out the illustration.

198
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:39,349
It appears to be some sort
of Asian hooker.

199
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,469
Because on Not a Father's Day,

200
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:45,647
you get a Thai you'd actually wear.
Wordplay five!

201
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:51,988
She's really kicking your ass here.
Your only hope is to go negative.

202
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,181
Okay.

203
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:56,273
I'll tell you
why my opponent is saying all this.

204
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:57,416
Three words:

205
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,165
scared of...

206
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,788
- babies.
- What?

207
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:02,415
That is crazy.

208
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:03,707
- I am not.
- Yeah?

209
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,162
<i>Remember that time you met
my cousin and her kid?</i>

210
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,871
She is so cute!

211
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,091
Do you want to hold her?

212
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,180
<i>Or the baby shower Lily threw
for her friend Erika?</i>

213
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,936
- Are you letting that baby sniff you?
- I don't want to get bitten.

214
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:26,319
<i>And don't forget about...</i>

215
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,093
- Talking baby commercial?
- Talking baby commercial.

216
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:37,574
But you're not like that.
You love kids and they love you.

217
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,213
Yes, I'm loveable, pretty and wise,
but is it enough?

218
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,541
Look, it all comes down
to one word: "you".

219
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:47,252
Are you ready to put
your own dreams on the back burner?

220
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,796
Grad school,
teaching art at the college level?

221
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,548
Look, you need to focus on Project Lily
before you can start Project Baby.

222
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,344
If you don't,
you'll always regret it.

223
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,058
And that wouldn't be fair to you
or the baby.

224
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:02,475
What's that?

225
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,262
It's Jeremy's sock.

226
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,647
I'm having a baby.

227
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:11,276
But what about all the things
I just said?

228
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,485
But, but sock.

229
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:15,864
But what about Marshall
working all the time?

230
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:17,614
- But sock.
- But,

231
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:19,242
but Project Lily!

232
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:20,909
Little fishies on it.

233
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,461
We made all of these arguments,

234
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:26,623
and a sock is what makes
your decision for you?

235
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:30,460
I guess that was the sock-out punch,
huh, Robin?

236
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:31,797
Shut up, Dad.

237
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,463
You shut up, baby hater.

238
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,575
Babies are scary, okay?
They have giant eyes.

239
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,328
And then, come on, the soft spot?

240
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,558
If there's gonna be
a self-destruct button,

241
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:43,891
at least hide it somewhere it
won't accidentally get pressed.

242
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,436
Where's Lily?

243
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:51,338
- Did you drink any of this?
- Not a drop.

244
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:52,490
Me, neither.

245
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:59,110
Meeting in five minutes. You'd better
bring your A-game for Mr. Li.

246
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,658
That guy haunts my nightmares.

247
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:03,938
Anyway, have fun out there, kid.

248
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,667
Put a baby in me, Marshall.
I'm ready.

249
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:21,888
- Lily, what are you doing here?
- I'm ready. Tonight's the night.

250
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:25,357
Put your melon-headed spawn
in my belly.

251
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,635
What?

252
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,905
Come on, right now.
Baby me. I'm ready.

253
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,613
Oh, hey, look.

254
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:34,359
The guys in the next building
are waving at me.

255
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,458
Hello, gentlemen!

256
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,488
We're going to make a baby!

257
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:42,510
I can't believe we lost her.

258
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,410
{\See, }This is exactly
why I'm never having kids.

259
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:46,918
You can't let them out of your sight
for even a second.

260
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,621
I can't find my file.

261
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,541
I pulled out "A" through "G."

262
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,298
They just sit there
with their stupid bottles.

263
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:02,137
They cry.

264
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:12,562
They spit up.

265
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:18,003
And that's why kids suck.

266
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:21,528
It is a good thing we broke up.
I forgot how totally psycho you are

267
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,700
- on the kids thing.
- I'm psycho?

268
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,474
Any time you even hear
the word "kids,"

269
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,454
you get two little lactation stains
on your shirt.

270
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:32,297
Thank God you're not a mom.
You are such an ice queen.

271
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,836
Any baby nursing from you
would get brain freeze.

272
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:38,885
{\Look, }Don't paint me as some sort of a freak
for wanting to remain independent.

273
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,341
There are {\plenty of }normal people out there
who don't want to have kids.

274
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,846
Brother, lay your hand on this box
of condoms and repeat after me.

275
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:48,307
I, state the fake name
you give to women.

276
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:50,646
I, Johnny Banana.

277
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:54,731
Vow to always choose
wet T-shirts over wet diapers.

278
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,109
- Vow to always...
- Yeah, you're in great company there.

279
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,778
I'm gonna look for Lily
in the bathroom.

280
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:02,910
While I'm in there,
I'll grab you a tampon.

281
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,196
Great. When you're done shaking off
at the urinal,

282
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,671
maybe you could ask the wizard
to give you a heart.

283
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:09,814
You know what?
Maybe I should find somewhere else

284
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:11,706
- to stay this weekend.
- No argument here.

285
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:13,092
- Fine.
- Great.

286
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:14,167
Welcome

287
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,461
to our fraternity of non-paternity.

288
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:19,297
He is one of us.

289
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,302
Gentlemen, Mr. Li,

290
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,263
if you would all please open to page 5
of your merger documents.

291
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:29,600
I think the...

292
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,481
- What is it, Eriksen?
- Nothing.

293
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:39,401
I just think that you look...

294
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:40,963
very nice today.

295
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,413
What are you looking at?

296
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:56,509
I am looking at the future...

297
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:01,423
of our two companies,
and it looks very...

298
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,341
naked.

299
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:07,010
Would you excuse me just
for a brief second?

300
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:12,862
<i>Did anyone else see the drunk chick?</i>

301
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:16,646
You guys didn't have to...

302
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:19,597
It's a picture of me with no kids.

303
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:21,859
And there's macaroni glued
on the frame.

304
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,324
Guys, I love it.

305
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,570
Lily's not in there.

306
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:28,198
Your phone rang. I answered it.
I hope you don't mind.

307
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:30,201
Marshall's got Lily.
She's fine.

308
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:31,578
Oh, thank God.

309
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:34,867
What?

310
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:38,944
When I was putting your phone back,
and I found something in your bag.

311
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:41,336
I have a permit for that.
And the other thing was a gift.

312
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,317
This.

313
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,552
You stole Jeremy's sock.

314
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,193
No, I didn't.

315
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:53,306
I don't know how that got in there.
It must've fallen in. Weird!

316
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,572
- "Fallen in"?
- Or Lily put it in there as a joke.

317
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,392
That bitch be drunk.

318
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,107
I took it.

319
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,765
It's just...

320
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:05,428
so cute.

321
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:07,128
Sock.

322
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:12,075
Robin Scherbatsky, are you warming
to the idea of having children?

323
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:15,186
I don't know.

324
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:16,924
Maybe someday.

325
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,332
When I'm, like, 70.
Science will catch up.

326
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,649
Look, I'm just...

327
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,923
I'm confused lately. I'm unemployed.
I'm living on a couch.

328
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,635
It's been a rough couple of months
for both of us.

329
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,893
I have a spare bedroom. Why don't you
stay with me while you look for a place?

330
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,145
- Really?
- Yeah.

331
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:42,169
Thanks, Ted.
I already have some leads,

332
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,107
so it'll be one week,
two weeks tops.

333
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:47,193
<i>And that's how your Aunt Robin
moved in with me.</i>

334
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:52,070
I'm bored.
Let's go dancing.

335
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:54,701
Let's rob a liquor store!

336
00:17:54,863 --> 00:17:57,615
We're not going anywhere{\, okay?}. Whenever
we go somewhere when you're drunk,

337
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,140
you always fall asleep
as soon as we get in the...

338
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,688
We're going dancing!

339
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:06,631
We're gonna party all night long!

340
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:14,298
Can you circle the block a couple times
just to make sure she's really down?

341
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:15,555
Sure thing.

342
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,143
Latest Not A Father's Day
brainstorm:

343
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:23,531
a pregnancy test,
but instead of a little, blue line,

344
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:25,892
there's a little blue Barney
going like this.

345
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:30,820
Barney, Not A Father's Day is lame.
It's a holiday for losers.

346
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:34,129
What are you... talking about?
That's a great group of bros.

347
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:37,505
- It's the Cheerleader Effect.
- No, Ted.

348
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,287
That only works for chicks.

349
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,415
Take a good look at each one
of those guys individually.

350
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:02,140
These geniuses are not
childless by choice, my friend.

351
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,875
- Good night, Barney.
- Good night.

352
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:13,935
Sock.

353
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:22,832
- Do I smell chocolate chip pancakes?
- No, you smell "Chocolate chip

354
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,042
I'm sorry I was such
a drunk idiot" pancakes.

355
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,670
Is there any "Wish I hadn't puked
on your shirt" bacon?

356
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,213
There sure is.

357
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:31,987
Baby...

358
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:35,674
I'm so sorry about last night.
I know I was a mess.

359
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:40,056
I just started freaking out
about whether we're ready to be parents.

360
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:45,186
But you took such good care of me.
I know you're gonna be

361
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:47,398
- a great dad.
- I don't want to be a dad right now.

362
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:48,316
What?

363
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,803
Last night, it was just...

364
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:53,820
between balancing work
and drunk Baby Lily,

365
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,406
it was too much.

366
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:59,578
I'm just getting started at this job,
I'm working such long hours, I mean...

367
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:01,621
Look, I love you.

368
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:05,055
And I absolutely want
to have kids someday. I just...

369
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,710
I want to be ready for it.

370
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,253
Me, too.

371
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,299
Whenever we are ready,

372
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:16,177
I know you're going to be amazing.

373
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:18,197
You, too.

374
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:25,603
Do you want to go have
completely protected sex right now?

375
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:27,188
I do.

376
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:29,105
Do you want to finish
your bacon first?

377
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:33,315
You are the perfect woman.

378
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:44,099
