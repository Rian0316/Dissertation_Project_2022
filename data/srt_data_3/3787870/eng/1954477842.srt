1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,301
Previously on "the originals"...

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,601
Klaus: I assume
i have the misfortune

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:04,536
Of speaking
to my mother.

4
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,772
I have come to heal
our family.

5
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,841
I will undo everything
that has been done,

6
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,943
Thereby giving you
a new life.

7
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,111
You should
get out of here.

8
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:14,046
My brother is not
the forgiving kind.

9
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,048
I'm not afraid
of him.

10
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,548
I'm about to get even
with klaus,

11
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,783
And you're
gonna help me.

12
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,318
You're the alpha.

13
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,852
Our people are not
meant to be slaves.

14
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,055
You can free them.

15
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:23,789
[coughs]
ollie?

16
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,457
I want you to
rejoin our family,

17
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,792
Take the body
of a mortal,

18
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,193
And we can all
be happy again.

19
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,528
Niklaus...
you're not real.

20
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,331
I am flesh and blood,
your flesh and blood.

21
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,150
You are my son.

22
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:35,968
I brought him here to be
the father you never had.

23
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,670
You said you wanted elijah.
He's sleeping.

24
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,907
When he wakes, he'll
make his own decision.

25
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,310
You cannot
catch me, elijah.

26
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,545
You're getting
faster, klaus,

27
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,714
But you're not
yet fast enough.

28
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,116
Ha ha!

29
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:56,155
Klaus? Niklaus?

30
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:01,393
Elijah:
There you are.

31
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,430
[thunder]

32
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,773
Do you understand?

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,080
One day, only a monster
shall remain.

34
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:28,020
[elijah panting]

35
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:31,023
Klaus: I know you
are locked in battle.

36
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,759
Klaus, voice-over:
However deep in your mind

37
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,962
Our mother has set the stage,
hear my voice.

38
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:41,700
Our mother thinks she will win
because she has left you alone,

39
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:45,270
But you are not alone.

40
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,107
Let me in.

41
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:54,113
Let me help end whatever torment
she has forced upon you.

42
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,682
Uh! Ah!

43
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,886
Uh!
Oh!

44
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,454
What are you doing?

45
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,390
[panting]

46
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:10,496
I'm trying to enter elijah's
thoughts to wake him.

47
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:14,900
Esther has
locked me out.

48
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,303
Is this rash
a side effect

49
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,540
Of the witchy
acid trip he's on?

50
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,413
I haven't seen this
since i was a child.

51
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,948
Mikael would return
home from battle

52
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,117
More blindly
temperamental than usual,

53
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,952
And our mother
would use the petals

54
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,922
Of a rare marelok orchid
to put him to sleep.

55
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,324
She would mend his mind
with a spell

56
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:43,829
And then wake him with
the roots of the same plant.

57
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,698
If she has
access to it now,

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,034
Then maybe it also
grows in the bayou.

59
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,436
You stay here
with your wolves

60
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,005
And mind the fort.

61
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,340
I'd rather rip
your mother's head off.

62
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,509
Steer clear
of her.

63
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,444
I mean it, hayley.

64
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,280
She already
got to you once.

65
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,015
What would happen if
elijah were to wake

66
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,716
And find you a victim
of her madness?

67
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,686
I won't
go after her.

68
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,956
I promise.

69
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:22,534
I've learned a few things
from your mother.

70
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,206
I won't go after her.

71
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:33,879
I'll go after
everything that she loves.

72
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,251
[music playing]

73
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,337
[footsteps]

74
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,880
I'm so sorry, jack.

75
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,815
This is bull,
hayley.

76
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,984
Crescent tradition
says you have a funeral

77
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,121
At dawn,
and no one is here.

78
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,923
That loyalty...

79
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:55,627
Loyalty is gone.

80
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,964
We're standing around
moping over ollie's body

81
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,300
When there's a war
to be fought.

82
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,970
I understand that
you have to grieve, jack.

83
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,138
You waited for me.

84
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,173
So i'll do
the same for you,

85
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,843
But our people
need their alpha.

86
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,255
[sniffles]

87
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,991
Marcel:
Where's your alpha?

88
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:26,925
Unavailable.

89
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,193
So you brought
junior varsity?

90
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,528
I'm getting a little
tired of you

91
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,963
Using my place as a den
for wayward wolves.

92
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,166
Oh, it's just that we
were going to take down

93
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,034
Finn mikaelson today,
and considering

94
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,537
How he treated your vampires,
i assumed that you

95
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,140
Would want in
on the bloodbath.

96
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,343
I'm listening.

97
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,978
Well, it's not
gonna be easy.

98
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,881
He's surrounded by a pack
of juiced-up wolves.

99
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,783
He doesn't have
a weakness.

100
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:52,851
He does, actually,

101
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,953
And i have her
on speed dial.

102
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,889
He's got a thing
for cami.

103
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,824
Klaus would go ballistic if
we get cami involved in this.

104
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,226
Klaus ain't here,
and cami, well,

105
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,495
She's got this thing
about people telling her

106
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,964
What she can
and can't do.

107
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:11,336
Trust you, of all
people, understand.

108
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,971
He hasn't called.

109
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,706
He thinks he's
protecting me,

110
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,210
But i don't think
i want to be protected.

111
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,411
Truth be told,
i don't think

112
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,913
I want to be around him
anymore at all.

113
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:27,152
Well, that's a nice
piece of progress.

114
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,157
What's on your mind?

115
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,594
I was wondering. I...

116
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,498
I know this is, like,
horribly unprofessional,

117
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:46,738
But i was hoping i could
get a new advisor.

118
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,910
You aren't finding our
sessions productive?

119
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,179
No. No.
That's not it.

120
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,514
They've been great.

121
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,583
You're really getting
to know me.

122
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,520
I just...

123
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:05,090
I want to get
to know you, too.

124
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,797
Uh...

125
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,065
Right. Yes. Heh.

126
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:18,303
Mortifyingly unprofessional.
I'm gonna go.

127
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,609
Uh, camile...

128
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,450
Do you enjoy jazz?

129
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:42,828
[chanting]

130
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,298
[glass cracking]

131
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,941
Still at it?

132
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,577
[glass shatters]

133
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,012
I'm trying to repair
the damage that you did

134
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,948
To my delinking spell.

135
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,249
Oh.

136
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,785
The only reason i'm still
shacked up in this dump motel

137
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,855
With you is for your freaky
witch encyclopedia brain.

138
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,657
Ok. Well, here's
a magical secret

139
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,995
From the ancient legends
of the romani psychics...

140
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,497
Sleep, davina.

141
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,332
You've been awake
for days.

142
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,800
Kind of hard to rest

143
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,267
With a 1,000-year-old
psycho in the next bed.

144
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,369
When you say that,
i sound

145
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,871
Like a bit
of a creeper.

146
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:26,938
Can you just stop?

147
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,240
Stop what, darling.

148
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,541
Calling me darling
and trying to be funny

149
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:32,210
And... All of that.

150
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,447
Oh, well, most girls
like this, but then

151
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,048
You're not like most
girls, are you?

152
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,186
What i'd like is for you
to just stop messing around.

153
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,154
Ok, davina.
All right.

154
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,991
I have been trying
to charm you,

155
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,826
And your resistance
is as impressive

156
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,662
As it is baffling,
but there are things

157
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,998
That we can do,
big things.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,834
I can't share
my secrets with you

159
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,168
Unless we trust
each other.

160
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,971
I don't care about
your secrets, kaleb...

161
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,408
Kol. I don't even
know what to call you.

162
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,377
Kol mikaelson,

163
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,012
And if you want
to take down klaus

164
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,747
Without your
friends dying, well,

165
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,349
Then you'd be a fool
not to listen to me.

166
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,252
Uh! Ooh...

167
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,721
Uh...

168
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,723
What's happening?

169
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,992
That's mother dearest
calling me home.

170
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:25,430
[panting]

171
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,766
Well, you always
did know how

172
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,935
To leave a message,
mother.

173
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:33,338
If only all my sons were
as respectful as you are.

174
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,407
Kol will return
home soon.

175
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,576
Elijah will wake from
his slumber believing

176
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,744
The only way to salvage
his humanity

177
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,714
Is to rejoin our family,
which is why

178
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,117
It is time you
bring camile in.

179
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,954
Here. I've spelled this
to subdue her

180
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,922
Without causing
bodily harm.

181
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,891
I thought we had
more time.

182
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:53,925
We don't.

183
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,860
Once klaus has been
duly influenced

184
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:59,364
By his father, we will
need to act quickly.

185
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:03,201
No. There's no need
for this.

186
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:09,541
I can bring her in
without it.

187
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:35,066
Stop following me.

188
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,643
I have no intention of
taking esther's bargain

189
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,344
And no desire to be
remade a mortal being.

190
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,512
Now kindly piss off.

191
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:51,950
I'm in a hurry to help
my real family.

192
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,653
You seek
the marelok orchid.

193
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,954
How did you
know that?

194
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,523
I saw you carry elijah
home last night.

195
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,759
Who do you think used
to find the orchid

196
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,528
For your mother to put
mikael to sleep?

197
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,099
Without my help, you
could search forever.

198
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,471
My mother brought you
back from the dead.

199
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,707
My sense of strategy
tells me it wasn't

200
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,610
To play a father-son
game of hide-and-seek.

201
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,478
You can storm off
in a fit

202
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,180
Of stubbornness
if you like,

203
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:27,218
But i suggest you do
so toward the west.

Ha ha!

208
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,243
You have any fun
with magic, or is it all

209
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,079
Just angst and child
sacrifice with you lot?

210
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,547
You were a witch
before you were

211
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,015
A vampire, right?
Yeah.

212
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,984
None of my siblings have
tapped into their power,

213
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,987
Little bit of
a child prodigy.

214
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,890
I loved it.
I loved the power.

215
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,159
I loved
the rush,

216
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,929
And then when we turned,
i lost it all,

217
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,064
Went through a bit
of a dark period.

218
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,866
1,000 years?
Yeah.

219
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,868
Well, i'm
a thrill seeker.

220
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,670
Couldn't get that
from magic anymore,

221
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,905
So i looked elsewhere.

222
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,707
Murder, mayhem.

223
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,576
Youthful misadventures.

224
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,712
I actually spent quite
a lot of time with witches,

225
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,215
Learning from them,
teaching them,

Trying to get back what
my mother stole from me.

227
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:36,121
Is that why she brought
you back as a witch?

228
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,089
She felt like
this body

229
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,126
Would be the best
for the task at hand...

230
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:44,596
Spying on the
prettiest witch in town.

231
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,865
Can't believe your
mom sent you here

232
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,533
To flirt with me.

233
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,536
No, no. She sent me
to follow you.

234
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:56,641

was me.

But he won't be
unprotected.

238
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,989
There'll be wolves
positioned here and here.

239
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,124
Can we keep
this alley open?

240
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,726
Great.
We'll wait there

241
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,427
And rip vincent's
head off.

242
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,129
Nah. He'll body jump.

243
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,131
His head stays on.

244
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,132
He'll have a hard time
answering our questions

245
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,070
Without it.

246
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,006
Sweet. It's a big box
of dusty, old junk. We're saved.

247
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,141
They're dark objects
my uncle left for me.

248
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,477
I've been cataloging them
according to kieran's notes.

249
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,312
As far as i can tell,
these can be used

250
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,981
Against witches
specifically.

251
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,416
Kinky.

252
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,251
I remember these.
What?

253
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,820
100 years ago,
the human faction

254
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,521
Waged a war
against the voodoo queens.

255
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,990
They had a trader
spell these manacles.

256
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,358
You slap them
on a witch,

257
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,128
They can't do magic
as long as they're on.

258
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,329
All right.

259
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,529
Well, we're not gonna get
the handcuffs of doom on him

260
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,265
While he's surrounded
by a werewolf entourage.

261
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,267
We just lure him away.
I can do that.

262
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,637
Cami, if we do this,
you're the bait.

263
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,209
Are you sure you're
ok with that?

264
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,280
Make it look
convincing.

And you choose
to walk in silence.

268
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,959
Surely, you have
questions for me.

269
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,460
Just one.

270
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,728
Is there a way
to cure elijah

271
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,129
Without having to listen
to the pointless

272
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,665
Ramblings of
an old man?

273
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,368
I'm afraid the price
of my expertise

274
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,904
Is conversation.

275
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,873
You know, i used
to tell myself that

276
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,575
My real father must have
had no idea i existed.

277
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,979
Otherwise, he'd never leave
me to suffer under mikael.

278
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,014
Esther forbade me
from seeing you.

279
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,849
So i waited, knowing
that one day,

280
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,017
You would trigger
your curse

281
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,088
And need
your real father...

282
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:54,158
But when that happened,
mikael found me first.

283
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,095
I fought him for you.
Yes.

284
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,096
Well, your grand declaration
is just a few years too late.

285
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,531
Now, you joke,
but i know you've

286
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,400
Always felt a void
in your life.

287
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,335
I've watched you from
beyond for centuries.

288
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,404
You've traveled all
corners of the world,

289
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,206
Seen monuments erected,
feasted on the blood

290
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,174
Of history's most
extraordinary men,

291
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:14,012
But you've never
found true peace.

292
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,115
The only moments of joy
in your life,

293
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:21,953
However fleeting, have
been simple pleasures...

294
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,756
As you climbed
the himalayas,

295
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,058
As you tended
to your horses,

296
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,193
Quiet days teaching
that boy shakespeare.

297
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,029
Stop.
I watched you paint.

298
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:34,032
I watched you feel your
unborn daughter's kick.

299
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,401
I said stop.

300
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,370
A millennium
of observing me,

301
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,307
Were your eyes closed as
i slaughtered whole villages,

302
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,043
Fed my way through
thousands of innocents?

303
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,077
Because...
let's face it...

304
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,048
I have a tendency
to play with my food.

305
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,958
Have i made you
proud, father?

306
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,971
Remind me to teach you
how to send a text message.

307
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,407
You were told to get the
white oak stake days ago.

308
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,576
We need it now,

309
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:22,113
Seeing as your
father has risen.

310
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:25,116
Mikael?

311
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,919
Back from the dead?
Enough.

312
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,087
You kept it from me.

313
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,855
Why, because of
davina claire?

314
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,157
To protect your plan.

315
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,458
She's never gonna trust me
if she thinks i'm just

316

to the wicked witch.

317

handled, mother.

00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,110
I want that stake,
and i don't care

to get it.

It's everywhere.

321
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:29,614
My relentless mother
has set a trap.

322
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,984
I'll retrieve
the marelok for you.

323
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,919
At what cost?

324
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,388
Why don't you use
your vampire abilities

325
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,990
To end your doubts?

326
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,058
Search my mind.

327
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,427
You'll see i'm not
allied with your mother.

328
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,595
I have absolutely
no interest

329
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,098
In the inner workings
of your brain.

330
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,067
I'm surprised
at your cowardice.

331
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,736
While you stand here
in fear of me,

suffers further.

Gather the orchids.

334
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,292
What'd your mother
want from you?

335
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,394
She wants me
to take that stake

336
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,763
Out of your bag,
give it to her

337
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,565
So that you
can't kill klaus

338
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,767
Before she gets her
big, happy family.

339
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,102
Is that why
you called me here?

340
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,104
I'm not
my mother's puppet.

341
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,973
I want something
different entirely.

342
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,877
I want your blood.
Relax, luv.

343
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:37,248
I'm not gonna take it.
I'm asking you nicely.

344
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,449
Sure. I'll just
bleed for you

345
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,886
Without any
explanation at all.

346
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,222
About 100 years ago,

347
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,158
This tomb used to be
my playhouse.

348
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,459
The witches i used
to run with,

349
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,395
They used to make all
kinds of magic in here,

350
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,065
That is, until i pissed
the prettiest one off,

351
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:57,168
As i tend to do, and,
well, she locked me out.

352
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,337
So why do you
need my blood?

353
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,674
Her name was
mary-alice claire.

354
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:08,980
Only a claire witch
can open this tomb.

355
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,597
Where'd you get
all this stuff?

356
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,366
Well, i was a vampire.

357
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,635
I could get anything
i wanted,

358
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,803
But i couldn't
practice witchcraft.

359
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,139
So i charmed some witches,
and i taught them

360
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,942
A new kind of magic that
i learned in arabia

361
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,311
Called kemiya.

362
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:43,948
We made items that
allowed me to use magic

363
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,850
Without doing magic.

364
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,619
You taught them how
to make dark objects.

365
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,788
Yeah, and for a time,

366
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,024
They were scattered
all around the city.

367
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,458
I can't for the life
of me find out

368
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,794
Where they are now,
but...

369
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,297
I've got the one
that matters.

370
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,131
What is it?

371
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,799
It's not about
what it is.

372
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,035
It's about what
it could be.

373
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,904
You want to take
down klaus, right?

374
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,308
I've wanted one
thing for years...

375
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,177
To drive a dagger
into his heart

376
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,480
Like he's done to me
so many times.

377
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:20,084
Those daggers
don't work on klaus.

378
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,420
Smart girl.

379
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,923
With a little practice
and some trust,

380
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,426
We'll fix it
so this one will.

381
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,094
We'll put him
in a box.

382
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,929
Seeing as he won't
be entirely dead,

383
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:35,032
Your friends
will be safe.

384
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,368
So what do you say?

385
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,037

387
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,925
Thank you.
This is amazing.

388
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,793
I developed
an appreciation

389
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,128
For the music
when i moved here.

390
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,431
I never had a taste
for it before.

391
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,533
I see you're
still developing

392
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,602
Your taste for beer.

393
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,070
My mom said beer
wasn't ladylike.

394
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,973
So i learned to love it
as an act of rebellion.

395
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:16,941
What about you?

396
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,277
Snobby mom, distant dad?
Let's go.

397
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,979
Well, my mother and
i are quite close.

398
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,614
She made so many
sacrifices for us,

399
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,118
Now anything she asks seem
negligible in comparison.

[cell phone rings]

401
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,123
Oh. Hold on. So sorry.
Can you hold this?

402
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,327
Oh, i have
to take this.

403
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,495
A friend is
covering my shift.

404
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:41,866
I'll be right back.
I'm so sorry.

Klaus: I've always seen a blade
to have a very different use.

410
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,892
Mikael taught you
to kill, klaus,

411
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,128
But you were born
to create.

412
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,131
Power lies in embracing
your true nature.

413
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:50,634
You think i should accept
my mother's offer,

414
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,870
Sacrifice my vampirism.

415
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,140
Then what,
become a florist?

416
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,575
[chuckles]

417
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,144
You wouldn't be
sacrificing anything.

418
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,079
As a wolf,
you could be king

419
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,749
To an entire
species.

420
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:08,452
You would feel
true peace.

421
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,991
You would be
a better father.

422
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:21,232
I am no longer
a father.

We feel everything
more acutely.

When you were a boy,
after each full moon,

426
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,074
I would wake closer
to your village,

427
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,843
Having been drawn
to you in the night.

428
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,547
Since i've been back,
each month when i turn,

429
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:41,685
I wake further
from new orleans.

430
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,090
I know the call of
my own blood, klaus.

431
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:54,098
I know your child
is still alive.

432
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,142
It was a wolf bite.
Who broke rank?

433
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,977
I'll knock some heads
together and find out.

434
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,214
I'll know where
camile is shortly.

435
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,650
You'll
meet me there.

436
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,652
Come alone

437
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,653

can't be trusted.

Well, he bought it.

441
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,495
His locator spell
will bring him here

00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:27,131
Without
the bodyguards.

443
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,100
I always thought
having a woman's mouth

444
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:32,136
On my neck would be
more erotic.

445
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,655
You'll heal fast.

446
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:37,173
Let's get all these
lights off. Here.

447
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,784
We're so going
to hell for this.

00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:49,587
Ha ha! Yeah.
You get used to it.

Hey, i know this probably
isn't your ideal friday night.

450
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,960
I'm sure you'd rather be,
like, doing pushups

451
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:59,997
Or drinking beers with
your bros or whatever.

452
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:04,969
Eh, it's not so bad.

the plan one more time.

00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:08,372
Aiden is gonna get
vincent to the altar,

455
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,673
And then i'm
gonna jump him.

456
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,941
He's powerful, though,
so we only have

457
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,477
A few seconds to get
the shackles on him.

458
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,678
Where's marcel?

459
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,280
He's looking
for davina.

460
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,948
He heard she
was back in town.

Was part werewolf
and vulnerable to silver.

to replicate

on the dagger...

Trust me, i've tried...
but it's not impossible

To change
the dagger itself.

Say, changing silver
to gold, for example.

00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,396
So you've been hanging out
with me this whole time

479
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,065
Because you don't have
enough power on your own.

Oh, kemiya
is about chemistry.

So, here,
hold my hand.

It's a paragon

They use them
to conduct power.

488
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,353
Is the hand holding
really necessary?

489
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,854
I mean, we could
make out,

490
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:34,425
But would that not be
entirely distracting?

I'd be lying if i said
your offer wasn't appealing.

I've never known a parent
to be a benevolent force.

I think i would have liked
to have been your son,

But a different path
was chosen for me,

the past 1,000 years

Been son of mikael...
paranoid, vengeful...

00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:28,906
And powerful enough
to protect my daughter.

511
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,974
I want to help you
defend her.

512
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,810
I believe you,

513
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:35,345
But love is
what esther twists.

514
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,014
She will take the best
of your intentions,

515
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:42,086
And she will use them
to get to my little girl.

516
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,161
You waited too long

517
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:55,432
Before you came
to rescue me.

518
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:05,008
I won't make the same
mistake with hope.

519
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,183
No.

520
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,920
No, klaus.

521
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,290
I know you.

522
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:26,663
You are not
capable of this.

523
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:30,868
That's the first lie
you've told me.

524
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:34,705
Uh!

525
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,324
Oh...

526
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,641
It's late.
I should get going.

527
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,109
Suppose you'll
be wanting

528
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,677
To get back
to marcel's.

529
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,112
I lied to him
about you.

530
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,180
Probably go back
to the attic.

531
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:18,482
Voluntarily returning
to the jail cell

532
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,018
Where they
locked you up.

533
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,756
You must have been
lonely all that time.

534
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:30,127
A witch needs a coven,
even if it is just two.

535
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,663
When can we work
on the dagger?

536
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,299
Soon. We got some
more work to do

537
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:39,736
With each other
first.

538
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:45,209
You're gonna like me,
davina claire,

539
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:49,379
And i'm gonna let you
pretend a while

540
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:52,883
That you don't
already.

541
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,854
Well, i staked
it out.

542
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,856
Looks like a couple
of oliver's friends

543
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,858
Wanting to avenge
his death.

544
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,892
Where's cami?

545
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:03,861
She's tied up
near the altar.

546
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,529
Hey, you know what?
You beeline for her.

547
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,398
I'll handle the rest
of them, all right?

548
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,001
Aiden, your brother

549
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,637
Was among the recruits
that oliver rescued.

550
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,040
Was he not?

551
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,090
[thunder]

552
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,928
Oh, no.

553
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,063
[crack]

554
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:44,902
Camile! Camile!

555
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,105
First, i'm gonna
kick your ass,

556
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,107
And then i'm gonna
take my pack back.

557
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,208
Your pack?

558
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,843
Last i checked,
your pack

559
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:54,244
Was blindly
following me.

560
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,512
Want to talk
about following?

561
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:59,349
How do your mother's
boots taste, huh?

562
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:03,921
Ha! What have you
done with cami?

563
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,055
Oh!

564
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,624
Hybrids die by
losing their head

565
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,926
Or their heart.

566
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,761
Given the choice,
i'm gonna take the organ

567
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,931
That got you into this
mess in the first place.

568
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:17,134
[chanting]

569
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,871
[gagging]

570
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:28,011
Aagh!
Huh!

571
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:37,020
Aagh!

572
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:44,161
[clank clank]

573
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,632
[sobs]

574
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,436
You would've done the
same thing to me, finn.

575
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:55,105
[chains rattle]

576
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,074
Hey, are you ok?

577
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,109
I'm so sorry
i made you wait.

578
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:03,513
Your timing was
pretty awesome, actually.

579
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,649
Ha ha!

580
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,023
[elijah panting]

581
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,604
We were innocent
once, elijah.

582
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,107
We were innocent
once, elijah.

583
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,642
[panting]

584
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:36,113
[thunder]

585
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:39,182
This bloodlust was
forced upon us

586
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,151
By our parents,

587
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:44,054
Turning us from prey
to predator.

588
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:48,025
[thunder]

589
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:58,035
We are the demons
lurking in shadow.

590
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,037
We are the
savage villains

591
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:03,573
In fairy tales
told to children,

592
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:09,513
But not for my child,
not for hope.

593
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,747
In her story,

594
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:14,718
We are the knights
in shining armor.

595
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,722
Without you by my side,
i don't think i can

596
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,926
Survive my own love
for my daughter.

597
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:26,730
I need you.

598
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:30,667
I need you,
brother.

599
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,270
The monster in me
can only be checked

600
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,005
By the monster
in you,

601
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,074
By the monster
in you.

602
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:40,177
Only together can we
defeat our demons

603
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,780
And save our family.

604
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,188
[thunder]

605
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:06,603
Hraagh!

606
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,211
[panting]

607
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,056
[door opens and closes]

608
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:28,925
We put vincent in
the back of josh's car.

609
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,494
Is aiden
all right?

610
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:34,064
Mm, some ice and
bourbon, he'll be fine.

611
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,733
How'd you know
where to find us?

612
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:40,403
I spent a lot of time
tracking you when i was a wolf.

613
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:45,142
Call it
animal instinct.

614
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,478
What do you mean?

615
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:53,650
Oh, ollie used to
give me so much hell

616
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,652
For waiting on you.

617
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,522
Oh, girls came and went,
but i always knew

618
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:00,624
Someday you'd come.

619
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:03,160
See, our parents
had been so sure

620
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:07,097
That you and i could
change things for the better.

621
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:11,101
Jack, i think the girl
that you were waiting on

622
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:18,341
Was andrea labonair,
mythic revolutionary.

623
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,277
You got
hayley marshall,

624
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:25,315
A knocked-up tomboy
with a bad attitude.

625
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:28,151
You got dealt
a crappy hand.

626
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,020
[chuckles]

627
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,488
No. You're right.

628
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,091
You're not the girl
i waited for.

629
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,463
You're better.

630
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:02,652
What is it?

631
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:06,890
I spent the day
with my father,

632
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,060
My real father.

633
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,096
Esther brought him
back from the dead

634
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,065
Believing he
could convince me

635
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:19,369
To renounce
vampirism,

636
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:22,372
And the thought
of what i could be

637
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:25,742
Had i been
raised by him...

638
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:30,880
I'd have been
nurtured.

639
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:34,918
This was his.

640
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:56,072
He knew
about hope...

641
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:59,142
And i wanted
to trust him.

642
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:03,947
More than anything in
the world, i wanted to,

643
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,349
But...

644
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:11,955
Uh... I couldn't
be sure,

645
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,090
And i would never
forgive myself

646
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,458
If something
happened to her

647
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,362
Because of my selfish
desire for a father.

648
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:24,834
So i killed him.

649
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:29,139
Without hesitation,
i killed him.

650
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,909
[music playing]

651
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:39,382
You killed him
for hope.

652
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,959
Whatever innocence
remains

653
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:55,198
We must protect
at any cost.

654
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,010
[sobs]

655
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,014
[sobbing]

656
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,924
Yaah! Oh...

657
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,967
Sorry.
We're closed.

658
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:41,271
That's too bad.

659
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:45,542
I hear you serve the best
sazerac in town.

660
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:48,144
Camile, isn't it?

661
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:53,983
My sons have taken
quite the liking to you.

662
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:57,620
[chanting]

663
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,594
How do you feel?

664
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:08,064
The worst has passed...

665
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,100
Though i suspect
the nightmares

666
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,635
Are far from over.

667
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,903
Well, gather
your strength.

668
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,071
After the message
i sent mother tonight,

669
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,308
I expect hellfire to rain
down upon us imminently.

670
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,143
We need to make a move
before she strikes.

671
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:23,246
Marcel: Actually, moves were
made while you were sleeping.

672
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,081
It's good
to see you vertical.

673
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:31,054
Marcel and i each left
a gift for you in the ballroom.

674
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,758
You're welcome.

675
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:46,970
Kaleb: Kidnapping.

676
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:51,107
It's a rather unpleasant way
to begin a family reunion.

677
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:55,445
Well, wait until you see
how we end it.
