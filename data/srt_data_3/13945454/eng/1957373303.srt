00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,480
I wanted to ride in with my best friend.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,520
Hmm? You've had a fight, haven't you?

179
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,120
No. No, not had a fight exactly.

180
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
What did you do?

181
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
Okay. Um, all right.

182
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
So a few days ago, Ruby said,
"I love you," and I didn't say it back.

183
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,520
Oh my God!

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,360
Well, what did you say?

185
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
I said,

186
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
"That's nice."

187
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,040
[laughs]

188
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Is that bad?

189
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Very bad.

190
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,960
Very, very bad.

191
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
- [laughs] You said, "That's nice"?
- Yeah.

192
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,720
Yeah. Well, I couldn't lie, Eric.

193
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,720
And it's not like I don't really like her.

194
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,560
I do, but love is a big word,

195
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,160
and I don't think
I've felt that way about anyone.

196
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Except Maeve.

197
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes, but that is over.

198
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,960
I… I don't even know if I believe in love.

199
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,200
It's all just…
it's all just a chemical reaction.

200
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,520
Otis,
you're the most romantic person I know.

201
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,760
Maybe you just don't feel that way
about Ruby yet, which is fine,

202
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,680
but you have to tell her the what?

203
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
- The truth.
- The truth.

204
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
Because the longer you leave it,
the more hurt she'll be. Yeah?

205
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

206
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,720
- Yeah.
- Come on!

207
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
[whimsical music playing]

208
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,280
I… I was thinking that maybe if I got a B

209
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,160
on the test this afternoon,

210
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,080
that I might be able to move up a set.

211
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,720
Fingers crossed, Adam.

212
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,280
Okay. Um, all right. Come over.

213
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,400
Uh, remember what I said
about how sentences need full stops?

214
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

215
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,800
Show me here where they would go.

216
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
[whimsical music continues]

217
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,160
[screams]

218
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,120
- What's happened to your face?
- What's happened to your face?

219
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,400
- Nothing.
- Nothing's happened to my face either.

220
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,760
Something's happened to your face, mate.

221
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,840
- Anwar, your face is hideous.
- I know. I look like a crazy fucking mofo.

222
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,360
- Well, should you go to hospital?
- No, I think it's just stress hives.

223
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,160
- What are you stressed about?
- [shouts] It's hard being me. Okay?

224
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
- [gasps]
- Ruby!

225
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,480
Want me to carry your bag to SRE for you?
Maybe we can have a little chat.

226
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,280
- You back in the game?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
Ooh la la. Ooh la la. Ooh la la.

228
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,760
Are you sure that she said she loves you?

229
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,800
'Cause it seems more like she hates you.

230
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
[Hope] Attention, everyone.

231
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,120
I'm sure you've read today's news article
with Dr. Jean Milburn.

232
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,240
"After spending a length of time
on the Moordale campus,

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,120
I realized there is a battle happening

234
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,520
for the emotional
and sexual health of our teenagers."

235
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't know about you,

236
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,560
but I am sick of hearing our school's name
being dragged through the mud,

237
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,760
which is why I'm implementing a plan
to put a stop to that.

238
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,160
It starts with a new syllabus for SRE,

239
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,760
which will now be called
Growth and Development.

240
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,320
And to put our parents'
and investors' minds at ease,

241
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,280
I want you all to follow
these new guidelines precisely.

242
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,760
That means no one will diverge
from the set topics,

243
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,920
and no one will talk to students
about their private lives.

244
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,880
The students usually have
quite a lot of personal questions.

245
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,560
School is not a place
for personal questions.

246
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,320
Jobs were lost over inappropriate events
that happened on this campus,

247
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,160
and I want you all to be protected
from that happening again.

248
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Understand?

249
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm off to pregnancy yoga.

250
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
What are you doing?

251
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,360
[exhales] I'm building a tree house.

252
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,520
Okay. Why?

253
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
It will be fun for our baby to play in.

254
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,400
I made one for my daughters
when they were kids, and they loved it.

255
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
It's okay?

256
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,120
Sure.

257
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
[whimsical music playing]

258
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,920
[bell ringing]

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,560
[Jackson] Viv, wait up!

260
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,280
- So you're talking to me again?
- I was never not talking to you.

261
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,880
I was wondering
whether <i>we</i> could talk to Hope

262
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,560
about setting up something where people
could talk about what they need on campus.

263
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,640
- What kind of thing?
- [chuckles] A forum or something.

264
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,000
People could talk about
mental health or gender identity.

265
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,040
This is how far you'll go to get a girl.

266
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
- What?
- Person.

267
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,760
Do you even care about this,
or are you trying to get into Cal's pants?

268
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,680
Uh, okay.

269
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,200
Look, you were right.

270
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,840
I didn't take head boy seriously, okay?
I didn't care.

271
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,840
But I wanna be better.

272
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,760
Okay, um, I'll think about it.

273
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
All right.

274
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,440
[giggles] I just read your story.

275
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,680
It's amazing.

276
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,360
I can't believe Glenoxi had sex
with Starlanza after she ate her mother.

277
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,040
She's very complicated.

278
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,400
Do you think I've got a chance at winning?

279
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,960
Do you think <i>The Moordale Gazette</i>'s
the right place for it?

280
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,560
I already applied.

281
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,920
Oh. Okay.

282
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,640
It might not be
to everyone's taste, you know?

283
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
I think I've got a pretty good shot.

284
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,880
I told you, you have to have
the perfect timing of the mushroom.

285
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,680
- How are you getting the perfect timing?
- When you see the blue shell…

286
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,880
[Eric] Wow, Lily,

287
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,720
you look normal.

288
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,360
Your hair looks nice, Lily.

289
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,280
Yeah, you're almost pretty.

290
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
What happened to your face?

291
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,400
I was giving you a compliment.
Doesn't mean we're friends.

292
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,960
Did my hair really look that weird before?

293
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,880
No.

294
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,040
I thought it looked really cute.

295
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,280
[Viv] Listen up, everyone.

296
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
If you haven't paid for the school trip,
please see Hope today.

297
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,560
Mmm.

298
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,760
[in bad French accent]
I cannot wait to eat baguettes with you!

299
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,960
- [chuckles] What?
- I'm being French.

300
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,920
Oh, okay.

301
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,440
Um, yeah, I'm not gonna go
on the school trip.

302
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,240
- Why?
- 'Cause it's too expensive.

303
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,640
It's not that much, is it?

304
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,880
It is expensive. My mum freaked out
when she saw how much it was.

305
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,720
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,320
[Viv claps]

307
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,880
For today's SRE class,

308
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,840
boys will be in this classroom
and girls in this one.

309
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Can we please form
two orderly lines, please?

310
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,200
Uh, where do I go?

311
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,960
Yeah, I don't know.

312
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,360
So Cal wants to know
what line they should join.

313
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,840
Boys in this classroom
and girls in this one.

314
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,320
But I'm non-binary.

315
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,120
- I… I don't know which line either.
- Um, wait here. I will ask for you.

316
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,880
What seems to be the problem?
Other than your uniform again.

317
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,160
We don't fit into the description
of boy or girl,

318
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
so where are we supposed to go?

319
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,680
You can both go in the girls' line.

320
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,400
But I'm not a girl.

321
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,600
They'll be discussing female anatomy,
which I'm sure will be helpful for you.

322
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,880
So we go to the vagina or penis line.
Is that what you're saying?

323
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,480
It's okay. I… I don't wanna cause trouble.
I'll go with the girls.

324
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,600
[Hope] Thank you. That's very helpful.

325
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,520
Is there anything else, Cal?

326
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,920
Mm-hmm. This is complete bullshit.

327
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,200
Be careful, Jackson.

328
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,800
Wouldn't want
to see you going down the wrong path.

329
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,600
- [VCR button clicks]
- Okay, guys.

330
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,520
No questions, okay? No questions.

336

<i>at a disco, or kissing the girl
you've got a crush on for the first time.</i>

337
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,040
Sleep for me.

I'm here to tell you
about how a night of sex ruined my life.

342
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,760
Did me and my boyfriend use a condom?

343
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,200
Yes.

344
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
Did it split?

345
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,240
Yes.

346
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,640
Did my boyfriend tell me?

347
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,120
No.

348
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,240
[man in video] <i>Homosexual activities have</i>

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,720

<i>and AIDS.</i>

354
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,800
Um, sir, this video is not talking
about safe sex at all.

355
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
It's just shaming gay people.

356
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,520
What do flying penises
have to do with STIs?

357
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Remember, we're not asking questions.
We're just watching the video, so...

358
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,080
- Why can't we ask questions?
- That's another question.

359
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,640
They're making valid points
about this video, which isn't informative.

360
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,040
It's just preaching abstinence
and homophobia,

361
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,920
which is dangerous,
and we're a bit old for flying penises.

362
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,400
- Stop saying "penis" to me.
- You can't put this on and expect us...

363
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,760
Please, you're disrupting the class.
Get out.

364
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,280
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously. Go.

365
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,480
He can't say "penis" in sex ed, sir?

366
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm sorry, okay?

367
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,080
But I could lose my job
if I let you all ask me questions.

368
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Just watch it, please.

369
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,760
I believe teenagers shouldn't have sex
because sex will ruin your life.

370
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,920
Forever.

371
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,360
I went from having dreams
to having a six-month-old baby

372
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,800
that left me with a leaky bladder
and a baggy vagina.

373
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,680
Sorry, is the boys' class being taught
about pregnancy as well,

374
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,960
or is it just us girls?

375
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,480
It's just us, is it?

376
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,000
- Very progressive.
- [Hope] Quiet, Maeve.

377
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,120
After getting pregnant,
I had no choice but to leave school.

378
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
There are always choices.

379
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,600
- Women do not have to have children.
- [Hope] Enough!

380
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,640
[Maeve] We shouldn't be shamed
for having sexual desires.

381
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
You make sex sound terrifying,
but it doesn't have to be.

382
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,920
It can be fun and

383
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,200
beautiful and teach you things
about yourself and your body.

384
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,040
You should be telling us
how to do that safely.

385
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,360
Not telling us to refrain
because it doesn't fucking work.

386
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
Okay. Out, now.

387
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,600
Happily.

388
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
[door opens]

389
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,960
- [woman] Right.
- [door closes]

390
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,720
Now we're going to watch
a video of me giving birth,

391
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,080
where you'll see that I tore
from my vagina to my arsehole.

392
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,760

[whimsical music playing]

396
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,080
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

397
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,080
Yeah, but my opinions on abstinence
weren't appreciated, so I got kicked out.

398
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,880
Yeah, me too.

399
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,160
We need to tell Hope she can't be
teaching this stuff. It's backwards.

400
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,760
- She's not gonna listen.
- We need to do something.

401
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,880
Like what?

402
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,040
I dunno.
Maybe we could help people like before.

403
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,520
You mean take their money?

404
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
That wasn't the only thing
the clinic was about.

405
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,760
What else was it about?

406
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,880
Anyway, I'm not getting involved anymore.

407
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,720
It's not my problem.

408
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,080
It's not your problem?

409
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,640
Why? Because you're too cool?
You don't need to care anymore?

410
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
You didn't wanna do the clinic either.

411
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,680
Yeah, you're right.
And now I remember why.

412
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm going to the library.

413
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,600
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

414
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,960
- Hey!
- Hey.

415
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,360
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Huh?

416
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,120
Uh, do you wanna talk about it?

417
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,120
- Nope.
- [Jackson chuckles]

418
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,680
Let's get baked.

419
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay.

420
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,600
Sometimes me and Malek
don't use a condom. He pulls out.

421
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,960
I thought that if something went wrong,
I would just get the morning-after pill.

422
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,720
- That's okay, right? Yeah, that's okay.
- No, that's not okay!

423
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,760
We've just watched a woman push
something the size of a watermelon

424
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
out of her vagina.

425
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,120
Nothing's okay.

426
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,440
My rash could be syphilis, herpes, or HIV.

427

429
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,560
Okay, we must never have sex again.

430
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,920
- Agreed.
- Understood.

431

[Emily imitating bird call]

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,360
Um, I could get in trouble for this,
but realistically, you'll have sex again.

433

would make Helen Brook roll in her grave.

434
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,120
So, for the love of God,

435
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,240
please talk about contraception
to a sexual health professional.

436
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,600
There's a sexual health clinic
on Mayfield Road. Mayfield Road.

437
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,240
Oh. Yeah, thanks. Bye.

- Where the fuck is Mayfield Road?
- Who the fuck is Helen Brook?

439
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,840

for reproductive rights.

and protect myself from your penis!

521
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,120
Just… No one's
ever written me poetry before.

522
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,160
I wanted to remember it.

523
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,440
- Adam doesn't write you poetry?
- Sorry?

524
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,200
[laughing]

525
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,600
Sorry. No, it's just, um…

526
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,880
No, Adam does not write me poetry.

527
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,080
Well, that's sad.

528
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,280
Poetry is magic.

529
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,360
Abracadabra.

530
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,080
Heard you were talking about magic.

531
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
[chuckles]

532
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,840
No, we were talking about poetry.

533
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,000
- Yeah.
- Right.

534
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,360
Eric doesn't like poetry. That's why
he's giving you your books back.

535
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,880
I never said I didn't like poetry.

536
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,360
The poet Ariana Brown said
about our various selves

537
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,200
that they are
"all names you wear in harmony."

538
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,520
"Until you can't."

539
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,000
Was he taking the piss?

540
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,280
I don't know.

541
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,960
Why did you say I didn't like poetry?

542
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, I didn't think that you did.

543
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
- Why do you care what he thinks?
- I don't.

544
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,320
- Why are you getting upset about it?
- I... We're arguing again!

545
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,160
I think it will be good for us
to get some space when I'm in Nigeria.

546
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,120
- You wanna get away from me?
- Adam, you are so defensive!

547
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,640
No, no, no. You just said
that you wanna get away from me.

548
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,200
How am I supposed to feel?

549
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,120
- I don't have the energy to fight.
- Fine. Don't, then.

550
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,280
- Hello, Hope.
- Hi.

551
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,160
I wanted to talk about what happened
with the girls' and boys' lines.

552
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,320
Okay.

553
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,080
I think it made
some students feel really uncomfortable.

554
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,320
Well, I'm not sure
school is supposed to be comfortable.

555
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
I think it's supposed to be hard.

556
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,960
And challenging.

557
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,200
I agree 100%.

558
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,440
But I wonder if students
might have space to be challenged

559
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,840
if they felt we were listening
to their concerns.

560
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,360
Okay. What do you suggest?

561
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,680
I was thinking of setting up
a student forum to hear direct feedback

562
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,120
from students about what they wanna see
implemented on campus.

563
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,360
This shows great initiative, Vivienne.

564
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,480
I'll be interested
to see what you discover.

565
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,960
In the meantime,

566
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,080
I'd like you to keep an eye
on your peers during the trip.

567
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,640
- So can I have your number, please?
- Yeah.

568
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,120
I'll text you.

569
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,800
Okay.

570
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,760
Great.

571
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,760
[door closes]

572
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
Okay.

573
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,160
Ah, Maeve.

574
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,760
Have you calmed down

575
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,680
since your little outburst
in Growth and Development?

576
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,960
Well, what was being taught is bollocks.

577
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,840
That spirited energy would be
better channeled into your education,

578
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,160
especially if we're going
to find the funding for the GTIP.

579
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,880
Sorry for saying bollocks.

580
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,120
You wanted to see me
about the trip? I can't go.

581
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
Your fees have been paid.

582
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,400
By who?

583
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,320
It was an anonymous payment.

584
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,080
Okay.

585
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,600
I'm serious about the hair.

586
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,280
Change it immediately.

587
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,360
[indistinct announcement over PA]

588
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,080
Oh, Michael.

589
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,720
How are you? [chuckles nervously]

590
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,640
- I didn't think you liked Mexican food.
- I don't.

591
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,200
Not that I've tried it.

592
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,040
I'm just shopping for dinner.
My friend is cooking…

593
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,800
"Fa-jee-tas."

594
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,040
[chuckles nervously]

595
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,800
Um…

596
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,920
[splutters] It's pronounced "fajitas."

597
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,080
Oh.

598
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,520
I think you might like them.

599
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,240
How are you coping with everything?

600
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,680
Good.

601
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,080
I'm very, very

602
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,160
excellent.

603
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,960
How's Adam?

604
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,480
Why don't you ask him yourself?

605
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,200
I haven't heard from him, so…

606
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,640
I think he'd appreciate it
if you reached out to him.

607
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,000
You're his father.

608
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,080
It's not too late to fix things, you know?

609
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,000
[whimsical music playing]

610
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,440
The pull-out method can lead
to unwanted pregnancy

611
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,040
if your partner doesn't pull out in time
or sperm gets into your vagina.

612
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,160
It also puts you at greater risk
of getting or transmitting an STI.

613
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,040
Is your boyfriend putting pressure on you
not use a condom?

614
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,680
He says it makes it feel better for him.

615
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,280
How does it feel for you?

616
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,200
Like I can't enjoy the sex
'cause I'm scared of getting pregnant.

617
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,600
Well, that's no good for anyone, is it?

618
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,080
- [Olivia sighs]
- Now, tell me.

619
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,560
[nurse] Do you engage in unprotected sex?

620
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,560
Every film I've seen with a gay person
ends with them having sex

621
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,360
and dying of AIDS.

622
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,160
I don't wanna die.
So, yeah, I always use a condom.

623
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,000
So long as you and your partner,
or partners, are practicing safer sex,

624
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,760
getting tested regularly,
you're very unlikely to contract HIV.

625
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,600
There's a medication now called PrEP
that protects people from contracting HIV

626
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,320
if they are engaging
in frequent casual sex

627
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
in situations
that might be putting them at high risk.

628
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,720
And for those that do contract the virus,
there's medicines now

629
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,960
that enable them to live
a long and healthy life,

630
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,480
even get to the stage
where the virus is undetectable,

631
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,240
which means
it can't be passed on to somebody else.

632
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,800
So, I don't think
you're gonna be dying for a while yet.

633
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,640
Now have you changed your diet recently
or used any new detergents?

634
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,560
No.

635
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,480
What about new condoms or lube?

636
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,880
[phone chimes]

637
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,240
Well, apparently, I'm allergic
to strawberry-flavored condoms.

638
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
Mm-hmm. And my boyfriend's a dickhead.

639
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,320
You gonna dump him?

640
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
No. I still love him, annoyingly.

641
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,320
Um, does he love you?

642
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Yeah. Of course he does.

643
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,200
Ruby Matthews. You can come in now.

644
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,720
Otis doesn't love me.

645
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,920
What do you mean?

646
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,800
I told him that I loved him,
and he didn't say it back.

647
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,480
What did he say?

648
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,960
He said, "That's nice."

649
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,160
- [Anwar] What a dickhead.
- Everyone loves you.

650
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
I know. That's why I'm so confused.

651
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,920
I think I'm in the wrong place.

652
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,680
[whimsical music playing]

653
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,320
I couldn't decide
which of your favorite meals to make,

654
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,640
so I made them all.

655
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,640
Well, Joe did, but, um…

656
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,680
I'm really trying here.

657
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,480
I can see that.

658
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,720
These chips are cold.

659
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,960
Well, you were late.

660
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,800
Yeah, well, I was cutting my hair.
New school rules.

661
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,600
- Looks nice.
- Thanks.

662
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,520
I think Anna paid for my France trip
without telling me.

663
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,440
- So you're going?
- I don't need charity from anyone.

664
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,520
Maeve, don't be proud.
Just go on the trip.

665
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,440
Don't tell me what to do.

666
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,680
So you're still angry at me, then?

667
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,200
That would be a lot easier…

668
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,560
Than liking me?

669
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,680
Yeah, than liking you.

670
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,520
But you also fucked up.

671
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,680
Why did you do it?

672
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,360
I was threatened.

673
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,200
You just get me.

674
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,520
Like, we've both been through
so much of the same shit.

675
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,480
You understand me like nobody else does.

676
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,120
I didn't wanna give that up.

677
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,280
Well, I feel the same.

678
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,640
I'm truly, truly sorry.

679
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,640
Can…

680
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,640
Nothing.

681
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,920
You wanna know what I can feel?

682
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,080
Yeah.

683
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,200
[Maeve chuckles]

684
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,760
Well, I can't feel anything

685
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,240
below my level of injury.

686
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Um…

687
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,120
If you put your hand on my chest,
I'll show you.

688
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,800
- Okay.
- I'll tell you when.

689
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,040
There you are.

690
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,640
[emotional music playing]

691
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,120
I can get hard.

692
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,040
I just need a little help.

693
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,880
Not that we're gonna do that yet.

694
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
So…

Thanks for inviting me over.

I've been wanting to talk

722
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,400
because I know

723
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,800
why you're angry with me.

724
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,480

I've been having an amazing time with you,

But you don't love me.

I just have to say that in my own time.

And I don't feel that way right now.

Mm.

And she asked me how I was,
and we spoke about Adam briefly.

Mm. And then, just as she was leaving,

she said something about
it never being too late to fix things,

768

872
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,280
I just wish you wouldn't get jealous.

873
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,280
I chose you.

874
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
I, uh…

875
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,000
I don't want us to have space…

876
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,400
'Cause I love you.

877
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,880
I love you too.

878
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,640
[Adam laughs]

["La Ballade Des Gens Heureux"
by Gérard Lenorman playing]

880
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,320
Hi there. What's... Ooh.

881
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,040
Okay.

882
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,680
[indistinct chattering]

883
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,120
Glad to see
you took my advice seriously, Maeve.

884
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,760
Something tells me
you don't take advice from anyone, Cal.

885
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,800
- Your uniform's still shabby.
- I don't understand why it's a problem.

886
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,600
Perhaps you can attend
Vivienne's student forum next week

887
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,280
and raise your concerns there.

888
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,880
Do keep me updated on the trip, please.

889
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,200
[Jackson] Vivienne's forum?

890
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,320
- You didn't tell her it was my idea?
- Didn't come up.

891
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,280
Miss, how… how did I do on the test?

892
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,800
You got a D.

893
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,720
You'll have to stay in the same set.
Please don't be disheartened. Keep trying.

894
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,440
What's the point?
I'm not good at anything.

895
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,280
Everyone's good at something, Adam.

896
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,720
Maybe start by thinking about
the things you like doing.

897
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,280
I'm… I'm quite good at pretending
I'm Gandalf in <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

898
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,280
But that's a start.

899
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,640
Excuse me, sir.

900
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,560
Hi.

901
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,960
- Hey.
- All right.

902
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,160
Over to you two, then.

903
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,880
I'm trusting you
to maintain some discipline.

904
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,160
- Okay?
- Okay.

905
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,320
- Okay.
- You betcha.

906
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
[song continues playing]

907
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,520
[both laughing]

908
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,360
[exhales]

909
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,840
[song continues]

910
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,240
Okay! Let's go to France, motherfuckers!

911
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,440
Sorry, sorry.

912
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,680
[Colin] France!

913
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,880
Yo! [whooping]

914
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
[song continues]

915
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,760
