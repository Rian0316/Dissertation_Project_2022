1
00:00:03,695 --> 00:00:06,585
伯纳黛特  伴娘的礼服找得怎样了
So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?

2
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:07,885
如果你不介意看上去像个
Well, if you don't mind looking like

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,855
橙色交通锥的话  已经找到了
an orange traffic cone, great.

4
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:13,965
闺蜜们  我有办法解决礼服的问题
Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.

5
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:14,885
真的吗
Really?

6
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:18,135
十二年前  我表妹艾琳全家
12 years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,315
在她结婚前晚  全死于一场可怕的
died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident

8
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:22,015
一氧化碳中毒事故
the night before her wedding.

9
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:24,805
人间惨剧啊
That's horrible.

10
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:26,365
这倒未必
Yes and no.

11
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:29,535
那些还没被穿过的伴娘衣服
All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused

12
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:31,695
咱们就能免费享用了
and available to us for free.

13
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,635
只能说  大难全死
So it seems that cloud of odorless deadly gas

14
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,305
必有后福啊
had a silver lining after all.

15
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:38,795
你们看
Check it out,

16
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:39,925
都还在袋子里呢
still in the bags.

17
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:41,525
不是说尸袋  是说礼服防尘袋
The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

18
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:45,855
这个嘛
I don't know.

19
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:47,585
穿死人剩的衣服不太好吧
Dead people's dresses?

20
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:50,885
是啊  而且那超短袖...
Yeah, and cap sleeve...

21
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,035
我还希望你们不会注意到呢
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't notice.

22
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:56,995
艾琳总对打折的服饰毫无抵抗力
Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes,

23
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:59,875
超短袖太冷  开暖气才一氧化碳中毒的
and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.

24
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,095
女士们  自制啊
Ladies, please.

25
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,645
这间屋子曾是一个智慧的集合地
These four walls once housed an intellectual salon

26
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:10,125
在这里  大脑和胃袋都能吸收到营养
where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach.

27
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:12,425
虽然没人有错
But through no one's fault,

28
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:13,795
佩妮
Penny,

29
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:18,405
但晚餐谈话的质量的确下滑了
the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined.

30
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,405
再次重申  这事谁都不怪  
And again, I'm looking at no one in particular,

31
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:22,515
佩妮
Penny.

32
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:24,785
好吧
Fine.

33
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,835
那你想聊什么  谢尔顿
What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?

34
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:28,965
你居然问谢尔顿想聊什么
What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?

35
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:30,815
你何苦要逼死大家呢
Why do you hate us?

36
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:33,985
我准备了一些应该能同时吸引
I've prepared a number of topics that should appeal to

37
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:37,715
高阶谈天霸  与低档聊天人的话题
both the advanced and novice conversationalists.

38
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,635
你明显意有所指的瞄了我
Okay, that time you looked at me.

39
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:41,715
谁不想瞄你啊
Who didn't?

40
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:43,215
你的皮肤白璧无瑕
Your skin is like alabaster.

41
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:45,125
感觉根本没毛孔啊
Do you even have pores?

42
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:48,445
第一个话题
Topic one:

43
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:50,765
欧洲核子研究中心宣布超光速离子的存在
"Faster-than-light particles at CERN--

44
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:52,545
这是范式转换的新发现
paradigm-shifting discovery

45
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:56,525
还是像它们的乳酪一样千疮百孔的笑谈
or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese?"

46
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,975
开始高谈阔论吧
And converse.

47
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:00,395
好吧  谁想来
All right, who wants to go

48
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:02,195
我屋子里看看婚礼杂志
to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?

49
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:03,225
我去看
Oh, me.

50
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:06,105
完全不怪任何人  谢尔顿  我们闪人了
Through no one's fault, Sheldon, we're leaving.

51
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:08,635
等等人家啦
Wait for moi.

52
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:10,425
你也要走吗
You're leaving?

53
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:14,235
谢尔顿  有时你忘记了我也是一名女士
Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady.

54
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:17,035
女人天生带一种雌激素  促使我们一边
and with that, comes with an oestrogen fuel need to page through

55
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:20,105
翻阅光鲜厚重的杂志  一边暗恨自己身材不佳
thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.

56
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:25,355
新话题:  女人们
New topice: women.

57
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:28,965
讨人喜爱的谜女还是令人厌恶的八婆
Delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?

58
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:31,195
说得好
Totally.

59
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:32,735
超短袖有哪里不好了
What's wrong with cap sleeves?

60
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,235
只要身形适合  穿起来超卡哇伊啊
If you have the right figure for it, they're adorable.

61

《生活大爆炸》
第五季第八集

70
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:05,771
哟  艾米  什么风把你吹来这了
Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?

71
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,421
你们神经科学部门借了我朊病毒培养箱
Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions

72
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,391
来协助我牛海绵状脑病的研究
for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

73
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:18,821
她是来讨一杯疯牛病
She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.

74
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,531
把脑部退化疾病说得诙谐可不容易
It's hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious,

75
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,681
但你总能化正经为笑料
and yet somehow you do it.

76
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,071
餐桌上谈这个还"真"有意思啊
That's fun to have in a lunchroom.

77
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:31,571
真正的乐趣始于你能挑选
The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat

78
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:33,051
任意小白鼠来注入病毒
you're going to feed it to, and maybe you choose

79
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:36,291
搞不好选中的就是那只老咬你的鼠妈妈
the beady-eyed little mother who's been biting you all week.

80
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:38,981
拜托  我们在吃饭呢
Please, we're eating.

81
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:40,561
可不可以把那东西拿下桌
Can we get that off the table

82
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,711
然后换个话题聊啊
and change the subject?

83
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:42,431
换话题吗
Can we?

84
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:43,591
屏息以待吧
Stand back...

85
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:48,381
看哥怎么将聊天打屁升华到指点江山
while I turn this conversation into a "Conver-sensation."

86
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,271
这次完全是你自找的
This time, it's your fault.

87
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,911
我有一百个按字母顺序排列的话题  从
I have 100 alphabetized topics from

88
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:58,021
"洋蓟:这不过是蓟长得大一点罢了"
"Artichoke-- come on, people, it's just a giant thistle,"

89
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,181
到"《打鼾》:以鼾声为诗"
to "Zzz-- the onamona-poetry of sleep."

90
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:07,811
艾米  疯牛病毒得多久才弄得死我啊
Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?

91
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,771
我也不知道  四五年吧
I don't know, four or five years.

92
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,421
不行  远水救不了近火
No, it's not gonna do it.

93
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:20,221
伯纳黛特一直发给我
Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures

94
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:23,131
佩妮试伴娘礼服的照片
of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.

95
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,561
她们现在在逛街吗
They're out shopping right now?

96
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:25,491
是啊
Yeah.

97
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,811
只有她们两人吗
Just the two of them?

98
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,311
我想是吧
I guess.

99
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,881
很好  非常好
That's cool, that's cool.

100
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,261
她们为毛问我这种事情啊
Why are they asking me about this stuff?

101
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:38,261
哪个男人能知道鸡心领是什么玩意
What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is?

102
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,961
莱纳德要终点前冲刺啦
Leonard's coming down the home stretch!

103
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,671
加油啊  马儿  你能行的
Come on, horsey, you can do this!

104
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:02,541
该死  拜托  大腿肌肉  你也能行
Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this!

105
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,901
太棒了  冠军
Yes! First place.

106
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,891
我肯定能当一名好骑士  要不是小时候太高...
I would have been a great jockey if I weren't too tall.

107
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,921
和害怕马的话
and scared of horses.

108
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,021
谢尔顿  该你了
Sheldon, you're up.

109
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:16,821
什么
What?

110
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:17,731
快点  该你了
Come on, it's your turn.

111
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:19,551
我们说好要呼吸新鲜空气的
We said we'd get more fresh air.

112
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:23,791
抱歉  我有点心烦意乱
Sorry. I'm a little distracted.

113
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,731
我联系不到艾米了
I can't seem to get in touch with Amy.

114
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,701
不管是发邮件  邀请视频
I tried e-mail, video chat,

115
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:30,011
在推特上找她  或在她主页上留言
tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall,

116
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:31,611
发短信  都没用
texting her, nothing.

117
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,971
你打过她家里电话吗
Did you try calling her on the telephone?

118
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,901
对呀  打座机
The telephone.

119
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:42,691
莱纳德  在你的简单世界里
You know, Leonard, in your own simple way,

120
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:45,091
你是个举世无双的天才
you may be the wisest of us all.

121
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,461
语音信箱
Voice mail.

122
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:50,681
真是奇了怪了
Curiouser and curiouser.

123
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,231
要是你不放心  我们可以过去
If you're worried, we can go over there

124
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:54,511
看看她是否有事
and see if she's all right.

125
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:55,651
好吧
Okay.

126
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:57,451
话说我看到一条新闻
You know, I heard in the news

127
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:00,621
她家那一带有人目击山猫出没
a bobcat has been spotted in her neighborhood.

128
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:03,921
艾米很安全  不会被山猫吃掉的
I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.

129
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:06,781
谁说艾米被山猫吃掉了
Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?

130
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:09,021
你呀
You do?

131
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:13,051
莱纳德  我不过是说说当地新闻
Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item.

132
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:16,571
都怪你  害我开始担心艾米被山猫吃掉了
Now, thanks to you, I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.

133
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:18,361
就忘了山猫这档事吧
Forget about the bobcat.

134
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,861
你猛提山猫  谁忘得掉啊  
How can I? You won't stop talking about it!

135
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:28,301
世间伤心事*
*Everybody hurts

136
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:31,081

时有心伤*
*Sometimes.

140
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,171
她哭哭啼啼的
She sounds weepy.

141
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,871
我讨厌人家哭哭啼啼  咱们走吧
I don't like weepy. Let's go.

142
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:51,141
她可是你朋友
She's your friend.

143
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:52,281
爷们点
Step up.

144
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,431
艾米  艾米  艾米
Amy. Amy. Amy.

145
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,781
撤了
Bye.

146
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:58,951
你要去哪
Where are you going?

147
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,661
爷我是单身  不用搅和这破事
I'm single, I don't need this crap.

148
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,201
谢尔顿  你来做什么
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

149
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:06,441
我和你的电子通信
You didn't respond to

150
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,501
你全都没回应
any of my electronic communications.

151
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,881
我想一个人待着
I wanted to be alone.

152
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:14,941
你想聊聊吗
Would you like to talk about it?

153
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:19,941
友情提醒  想回答"不想说"可别客气
And keep in mind that "No" is a perfectly viable answer.

154
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,311
谢尔顿  我的世界要崩溃了
Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.

155
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,311
按照程序
Point of order.

156
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,791
因为你不开心  按照惯例
As you're in distress, it would be customary

157
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:31,101
我该给你倒杯热饮
for me to offer you a hot beverage.

158
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,751
但我是你的客人
But I'm a guest in your home,

159
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:37,601
按照惯例  你该给我倒杯饮料
so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage.

160
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:42,011
你想要怎么来面对面互倒饮料呀
How do you want to proceed vis-à-vis beverages?

161
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,391
无所谓
It doesn't matter.

162
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:45,171
都无所谓了
Nothing matters.

163
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:51,231
如果你想聊别的  不谈这事
If you'd like to take your mind off what's troubling you,

164
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:55,321
坊间传言  有人目击这附近有山猫出没
uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.

165
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:58,301
佩妮和伯纳黛特没叫我
Penny and Bernadette went shopping

166
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:00,561
就自己去买伴娘礼服了
for bridesmaids dresses without me.

167
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:03,791
这让你...
And that made you feel...

168
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:05,521
不开心吗
sad?

169
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:07,271
是的
Yes.

170
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,521
我就知道
I knew it.

171
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:11,131
继续说
Just keep going.

172
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,911
我好像还挺会读心啊
I guess I'm good at this.

173
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,151
我以为她们是喜欢和我一起玩的
It's just, I thought they liked hanging out with me,

174
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:19,621
原来我只是自己骗自己
but I guess I was fooling myself.

175
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,351
是不是她们来你家的时候
When they were over here,

176
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,041
你没给人家倒饮料啊
did you fail to offer them a beverage?

177
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:30,661
某些人对这事很在意很不爽
'Cause I can see how that could stick in someone's craw.

178
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,631
谢尔顿  我想请你做件事
Sheldon, I'm going to ask you something,

179
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,661
希望你不要用异样眼光看待
and I'd like you to keep an open mind.

180
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,101
一贯如此
Always.

181
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:40,851
此时此刻  我很渴望
At this moment, I find myself

182
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,291
与人有亲密行为和肢体接触
craving human intimacy and physical contact.

183
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,791
亲娘咧
Oh, boy.

184
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:52,731
你知道我们的关系仅限于精神层面
You know ours is a relationship of the mind.

185
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,631
我提议
Proposal.

186
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,671
咱俩一夜激情  大战数千回合
One wild night of torrid lovemaking

187
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:59,291
既能抚慰我心  也令我胯下湿热
that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.

188
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:06,071
反提议
Counterproposal.

189
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:09,881
我会轻轻地梳你的头
I will gently stroke your head

190
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:13,491
然后反复地说  "谁是乖乖艾米宝贝啊"
and repeat, "aw, who's a good Amy""

191
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:18,291
那这样如何
How about this?

192
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:21,531
法式热吻  七分钟的巅峰体验
French kissing-- seven minutes in heaven

193
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:24,171
在你上我二垒后划下句点
culminating in second base.

194
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:30,221
我帮你揉脖子
Neck massage...

195
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:34,671
然后你给我倒杯饮料
...then you get me that beverage.

196
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,891
我们抱一下  不商量了
We cuddle. Final offer.

197
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:45,951
好吧
Very well.

198
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:54,331
真要命
Oh, boy.

199
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:19,721
我就说说  二垒你触手可得...
I'm just saying, second base is right there.

200
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:30,026
我在考虑给自己搞个另类造型
Mm, I'm thinking about adopting some quirky affectation,

201
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,156
比如弄个烟斗  单片眼镜
like a pipe or a monocle

202
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:34,256
或是翘八字胡
or a handlebar mustache.

203
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:37,606
给外面那些满脑子想钓
For all those girls out there

204
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:40,396
印度钻石王老五一个明确的目标吗
looking for the Indian Monopoly man?

205
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:45,266
这国家太危险了
This is not a safe place.

206
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:46,996
什么东西都不能露白
You can't share anything here.

207
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:53,156
你们两个  给哥管好你们的女人
The two of you need to get your women in line!

208
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,226
啥
What?

209
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:58,346
昨一整晚  我被强迫
Last night I was strong-armed

210
00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:59,656
听那烦人的竖琴
into an evening of harp music

211
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,156
还得让情绪化的艾米・法拉・福勒熊抱
and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler.

212
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:03,316
本来那天晚上
This on a night

213
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,356
我是计划好要解决
that I had originally designated for solving

214
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:07,596
更高自旋引力场下的时空几何问题
the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity

215
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:09,506
以及搭乐高死星的呢
and building my Lego Death Star.

216
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,856
结果因为你们的马子  佩妮和伯纳黛特
And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette,

217
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,806
偷偷跑去买婚礼垃圾  也不叫上艾米
went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy,

218
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:19,866
她们完全没有想过
an action they took with no thought or regard

219
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,576
她们会影响到我  影响弦理论的未来
as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory

220
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:24,546
还影响我的乐高欢乐时光
or my Lego fun time!

221
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,146
那你想我们怎么办呢
What do you want us to do about it?

222
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,366
你显然没仔细听我的主题句
You clearly weren't listening to my topic sentence:

223
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,486
管好你们的女人
Get your women in line!

224
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:35,936
叫她们去跟艾米道歉  把关系修复好
You make them apologize to Amy and set things right.

225
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,826
我是个搞科研的人  不是某人的抱抱兔
I am a man of science, not someone's snuggle bunny!

226
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:41,766
为什么要我去跟佩妮谈
Why do I have to talk to Penny?

227
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:43,076
她又不是我女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

228
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:44,846
四年前是你请她过来吃午饭的
You invited her to lunch four years ago.

229
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,256
她的事全怪你  你给我搞定她
Everything about her is on you; you make it so!

230
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:52,616
-木须肉是佩妮的  -谢谢
- Moo-shu is Penny. - Thank you.

231
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,606
谢尔顿呢
Where's Sheldon?

232
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:54,876
他昨晚熬夜了
He was up late last night,

233
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,336
我提早喂他食  哄他睡觉了
so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.

234
00:11:58,716 --> 00:11:59,896
你真是体贴
That's so sweet.

235
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:02,676
不过明天一大早  他就会起床闹着玩了
Yeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play.

236
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:05,646
其实呢
So, listen, guys,

237
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:08,176
他昨晚之所以熬夜是因为
the reason he was up late is because he was

238
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,586
他要照顾艾米
taking care of Amy.

239
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:11,246
她有点伤心
She's kind of upset.

240
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:12,076
为什么
Why?

241
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:13,766
她的感情有点受伤  因为你们
Her feelings got hurt because you guys

242
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,836
没叫她一起去逛街
went dress shopping without her.

243
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:17,526
我跟你说了她会不高兴
I told you that would happen.

244
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:19,826
这是她第一次做伴娘
Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid

245
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:21,916
她有点兴奋过头了
and she's just getting a little crazy with it.

246
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:24,826
她老是不停地说不同文化里的伴娘习俗
She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions

247
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:26,406
而且都是得脱得光溜溜
in other cultures, and they're all about

248
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:29,376
互相给对方搓澡的那种
getting naked and washing each other.

249
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,276
对  她还老想知道
Yeah, and she keeps trying

250
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,116
我们的月经有没有同步
to figure out if our cycles have synced up

251
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,696
我们才能自诩为"三个同经手"
so we can call ourselves "The three menstra-teers"

252
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,696
仿三个火枪手

253
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:46,166
我们以为不叫她
We thought it would be easier

254
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:48,716
一起去逛礼服会比较省事
to look at dresses one time without her.

255
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:49,976
我感觉好内疚
I feel terrible.

256
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,726
我也内疚  我们会找她谈
I know. Me, too. We'll talk to her.

257
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:52,506
等等
Hey, wait,

258
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:54,166
她怎么知道的
how did she find out?

259
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:56,836
拉杰告的密
Raj did it.

260
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,976
他说下次还会揭你们的短
And he says he would do it again.

261
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,556
好吧  对不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

262
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:09,436
你给我发照片  我当时没多想就说漏嘴了
You sent me the picture; I wasn't thinking.

263
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:11,056
-华仔  -别这样  平时
- Oh, Howie. - Well, hey, I'm usually

264
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:12,576
我的嘴巴还是挺严的
pretty good at not blabbing.

265
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,266
你跟我说了那么多他们的事
You tell me tons of stuff about these guys,

266
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,386
我从来都没说出去
 and I never repeat it.

267
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:20,686
-你跟他说什么了  -没说啥
- What do you tell him? - Oh,

268
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:22,186
就一些枕边的私房话
you know, just pillow talk.

269
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,346
你们什么都不用担心
You guys have nothing to worry about.

270
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,966
咱两相好时  你没跟人家说啥吧
Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?

271
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:29,846
没有  你的小秘密我都没说过
No. All your little secrets are fine.

272
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:36,156
是啊  她绝对没说
Yes, absolutely fine.

273
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:40,456
我迟些再告诉你
I'll tell you later.

274
00:13:44,546 --> 00:13:46,446
来吧  肿瘤
Come on, tumor.

275
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:51,546
来吧  肿瘤  老娘要的就是扩散的小恶性胶质瘤
Come on, tumor, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma.

276
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:55,476
爽啊  脑瘤
Yay, brain tumor!

277
00:13:56,196 --> 00:14:00,016
你得知有脑瘤时的反映估计跟我不一样
Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.

278
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:04,166
-嗨  -你好
- Hi. - Hello.

279
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:05,716
你们怎么来了
What are you doing here?

280
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,926
我们是来道歉的
Well, look, we just wanted to apologize

281
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:10,136
那天没叫上你一起去逛礼服
for not bringing you with us the other day.

282
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,966
没必要道歉  这就跟《芝麻街》里说的一样
That's not necessary-- it's like Sesame Street says:

283
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,826
"这个东西跟与众不同"
"One of these things is not like the other,

284
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:17,726
"这个东西将孤独终老"
one of these things should die alone."

285
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,026
别这样嘛  艾米  让我们补偿你
Come on, Amy, let us make it up to you.

286
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,086
咱们办个闺蜜之夜
We'll have a girl's night;

287
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:23,286
你想干啥咱就干啥
we'll do whatever you want.

288
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:24,876
我们可以去韩国洗浴中心
We can go down to the Korean baths

289
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,406
照你说的那样
and do that thing you were talking about

290
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,136
互相给对方搓澡
where we wash each other.

291
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:32,286
戴着丝瓜络手套搓  不是用手摸
With-with loofah mitts, no hands.

292
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:36,606
没关系  我很高兴发生这样的事
It's okay. I'm glad this happened.

293
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:38,876
我再也不用假装某个美女
I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl

294
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,466
和她找准角度还算可爱的朋友
and her cute-in-the-right-light friend

295
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:42,026
喜欢和我一起玩了
want to hang out with me.

296
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:44,716
艾米  我们真的很抱歉
Amy, we're really sorry.

297
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:46,226
对  我们觉得特内疚
Yeah, we feel awful.

298
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,936
别  我会没事的  你们也不是第一个
Don't. I'll be okay. You're not the first girls

299
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,196
我以为是我的朋友  结果处处躲着我的女孩子
I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me.

300
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:53,796
感觉就像回到了小学  初中
It's like elementary school, junior high,

301
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:55,376
高中  大学  研究院
high school, undergrad, grad school,

302
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,106
还有去挪威交换的那学期一样
and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.

303
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:00,386
别这样嘛  艾米
Oh, come on, Amy.

304
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,606
你不懂
You don't get it.

305
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,836
看看这个大脑
Look at this brain.

306
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:07,076
我实在不想看
I don't really want to.

307
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,596
这就像我们
This is us.

308
00:15:09,646 --> 00:15:11,596
伯纳黛特  你就是善于
Bernadette, you are the analytical,

309
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:13,246
科学分析的左脑
scientific left hemisphere.

310
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:16,436
佩妮  你就是有自主创造力的右脑
Penny, you're the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere.

311
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:18,106
艾米在哪呢
And where's Amy?

312
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:21,416
她在这里  可怜的小肿瘤
She's right here-- the sad little tumor

313
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:24,126
没人愿意跟她一起去逛街
no one wants to go dress shopping with.

314
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:28,386
艾米  你不是肿瘤
Amy, you're not a tumor.

315
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:30,646
佩妮  告诉她她不是肿瘤
Penny, tell her she's not a tumor.

316
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:43,826
你知道亚历山大・格拉汉姆・贝尔
Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell

317
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,526
发明电话时
invented the telephone,

318
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:48,196
他提议接电话时说"啊嘿"吗
he proposed answering it with "Ahoy"?

319
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:51,636
啊嘿[Ahoy]  海盗或船员常用的打招呼语

320
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:51,666
啊嘿
Ahoy.

321
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,036
我喜欢
I like it.

322
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:58,186
艾米  是你吗
Amy? Is that you?

323
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:00,926
你喝酒啦
Have you been drinking?

324
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:04,036
你说什么  没我屁屁个错...
I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?

325
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:07,566
好吧  我们这就去
Well, all right. We're on our way.

326
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:09,846
怎么了
What's going on?

327
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:14,006
艾米在一家贩酒店的停车场喝得烂醉
It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.

328
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,436
真的吗  艾米
Really? Amy?

329
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:17,306
莱纳德  你该庆幸自己留不住女人
Leonard, be glad you can't keep a woman.

330
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:19,106
她们真是难搞
They are a handful.

331
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:27,526
看哪
Oh, look.

332
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,066
是小谢和小莱驾到
It's Sheldon and little Leonard.

333
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,526
嗨  小莱
Hi, little Leonard.

334
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,016
嗨  艾米
Hi, Amy.

335
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,476
嗨  小"抱"贝
Hey, Cuddles.

336
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,596
小"抱"贝
Cuddles?

337
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,456
对  小"抱"贝  我们抱过了
Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled.

338
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:40,996
少幼稚的猛问了  莱纳德
Grow up, Leonard.

339
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:44,916
艾米  你在这干嘛
Amy, what are you doing here?

340
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:47,176
我来这买酒
I came here to get a bottle of wine

341
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:49,966
佩妮教过我  借酒浇愁
like Penny taught me to do when you're sad.

342
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:53,916
是啊  但你怎么不回家喝
Yeah, but why didn't you go back to your apartment?

343
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,536
你没上过中学吗  莱纳德
Didn't you go to high school, Leonard?

344
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:58,456
酷小孩都在停车场鬼混
Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out.

345
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:01,816
虽然那些王八蛋从没邀请过我来
Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.

346
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:03,796
我们还是带你回家吧
Maybe we should get you home.

347
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,506
等等  等等  谢尔顿
Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon,

348
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:09,416
要怎么样你才肯去隔壁
what would it take for you to go into that liquor store,

349
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:10,916
买一瓶烈酒
buy a bottle of hooch,

350
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:13,186
然后带我去街对面那家旅馆
take me across the street to that motel,

351
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,046
跟我大搞特搞一番呢
and have your way with me?

352
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,216
是啊  谢尔顿  你要怎样才肯
Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?

353
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,956
我求求你们了  快走吧
I'm begging both of you, please, let's go.

354
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,286
好吧
Okay.

355
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:29,356
来吧
Come on.

356
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,116
起来没事啦
Upsy-daisy.

357
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:33,676
终于有人碰我二垒了
Ooh, finally someone found second base.

358
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:40,776
我懂你的痛
I know how you feel.

359
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:44,446
我的大脑前庭也像被刀子划过一样
I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.

360
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:49,886
找我干嘛
What do you want?

361
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,306
是要我把友谊手镯还给你吗
Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?

362
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:54,966
我没给过你友谊手镯
I never gave you a friendship bracelet.

363
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:58,946
我们刚认识时我做了一个  假装是你给我的
When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me.

364
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,776
你要的话  我可以还给你
You can have it back if you want.

365
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:05,316
不  你给自己做的  我想你好好留着
No, you made that for you; I want you to have it.

366
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,536
我们知道你很伤心  你完全有理由伤心
We know you're upset, and you have every right to be,

367
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,766
如果可以  请再给我们一个机会
but if it's okay with you, we'd like a second chance

368
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,116
纠正我们的错误
to make things right.

369
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,666
我们真的很抱歉
We are really sorry,

370
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,766
我们想努力向你表达
and we were trying to think of some way to show you

371
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:18,656
我们有多在乎你
how much we care about you.

372
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:19,366
所以
Which is why

373
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,286
如果你能当我婚礼的首席伴娘
it would mean so much if you would agree

374
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:23,246
那就真是太好了
to be the maid of honor at my wedding.

375
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:27,276
什么  等等  这是什么恶作剧吗
What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke?

376
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:29,076
就像在挪威  我所谓的"朋友"
Like in Norway, when my "Friends"

377
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:31,306
骗我跟发情的水獭洗桑拿那样吗
trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?

378
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:38,506
不  我真的想请你当我的首席伴娘
No. I-I want you to be the maid of honor.

379
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,186
我的天哪
Oh, my gosh.

380
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:43,106
都没有人请我当过首席伴娘呢
No one's every asked me to be the maid of honor before.

381
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,396
哦  不对
Well, that's not true.

382
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:46,656
有过一次  不过她们都死了
Once, but then they all died.

383
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,006
这么说你答应啦
So is that a yes?

384
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:53,346
答应  当然答应
Yes. Yes.

385
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:54,406
老天哪
Oh, my gosh,

386
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,776
我有太多事要做了
I-I have so much to do.

387
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,896
要准备新娘婚前派对和单身女郎派对
There's the bridal shower and the bachelorette party.

388
00:18:57,946 --> 00:18:59,546
单身女郎派对要做什么好呢
What should we do for the bachelorette party?

389
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,566
我知道了  我们去印第安人的蒸汗屋
Oh, I know-- we'll go to a Native American sweat lodge,

390
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:04,456
带上龙舌兰酒  去烂泥里打滚
we'll take peyote, roll around in the mud,

391
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:06,476
接着在伯纳黛特裸体上画生育符号
and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette's naked body.

392
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,126
终于要去做这事了
So that's happening.

393
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:10,336
是啊  当然  真好
Yeah, sure, sure.

394
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:11,966
拉斯维加斯也很好玩啊
Vegas is fun, too.

395
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:14,136
我有种想哭的冲动
I feel like crying.

396
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,706
当然  可能只是荷尔蒙作祟
Of course, I could just be hormonal.

397
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,146
等等  说不定我们的月经终于同步了
Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up.

398
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:19,046
伯纳黛特你快到了吗
Bernadette?

399
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:20,136
没有吗  佩妮呢
No? Penny?

400
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,806

抱歉  你是首席伴娘吗
I'm sorry, are you the maid of honor?

409
