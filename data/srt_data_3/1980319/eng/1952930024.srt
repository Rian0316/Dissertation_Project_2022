00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:04,312
- Pick up!
Tables 12, 4, 11.

00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:05,313
- Got it.

3
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:07,548
Hey,
when you get a second,

00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,217
stop looking at my boobs.

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,339
- Excuse me.

6
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:16,390
Waitress?

00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,609
Dude?

00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,229
- Hi, what can I get ya?

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,365
- We need some...
- [Snaps]

10
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:25,399
Is that annoying?

[Snaps]

12
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:28,085
Is that
obnoxious and rude?

13
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:29,787
[Snaps]

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,789
Would you find it distracting
if someone did that to you

15
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:32,906
while you were working?

16
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,593
Oh, you don't have a job.
Sorry.

17
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,511
- Damn, dude,
she burned you.

18
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:38,546
- Oh.
[Snaps]

19
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:41,799
No, hipster.

20
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:44,385
Do not think we're on the same
team. We have nothing in common.

21
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:46,420
I wear knit hats
when it's cold out.

22
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:49,023
You wear knit hats
'cause of coldplay.

23
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:52,393
You have tattoos
to piss off your dad.

24
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:55,095
My dad doesn't know
he's my dad.

25
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,930
You think...
[Snaps]

26
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,532
This is the sound
that gets you service.

27
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:00,234
I think...
[Snaps]

28
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:03,437
This is the sound
that dries up my vagina.

29
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,741
- The other waitress
disappeared, the Russian one.

30
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:08,325
We need horseradish.

31
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:09,443
- Please.

32
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,546
- That, ladies,
is how you treat a waitress.

33
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:19,637
Paulina!

34
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:23,591
- Oh, so... so good, oh...

35
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:26,794
- oh, sorry, I didn't realize
you were on break.

36
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:28,979
I just need
some horseradish.

37
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,482
- Here.
- Oh, cool.

38
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:37,605
Excuse me,
where's my waitress?

39
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:39,023

00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:41,475

Earl!

45
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:02,880
I made your favorite,
red velvet.

46
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:06,951
- My little cupcake
brought me a cupcake.

47
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:08,135
Let me pay you for that.

48
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,637
- Oh, no, no.
It's on the house.

49
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,138
It's your birthday.

50
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,306
How old are you gonna be?

51
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:13,757
- 75.

52
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,594
- Oh, Earl, if you were just
three years younger.

53
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,430
- Max, Max, big news.

54
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:22,116
The new boss fired
that Russian waitress, Paulina.

55
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:26,654
Turns out Chesty Kournikova
was Vladimir puttin' it out.

56
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,295
- Hello today.
I have paycheck for you.

57
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:37,614
- I need to talk to you.
You fired Paulina, Han?

58
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,333
- I am no longer Han Lee.

59
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:40,418
I have new American name

60
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,836

- Bryce?
Your name is Bryce Lee?

66
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:01,305
Wait, wait,
um, um, um...

67
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,025
Don't hire a new waitress,
okay?

68
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:05,309
I've been doing
all the work anyway,

69
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,827
and I really could use
the extra money.

70
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:08,029
- You need help.

71
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:11,165
- No, I don't.
- Everyone need help sometimes.

72
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,451
- I don't. I've been waiting
my whole life, okay?

73
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:16,087
I've waited on tables,
I've waited in bars,

74
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:18,472
I've waited on
home pregnancy tests.

75
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,491
- I already hire new waitress.

76
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:23,260
She work in all top restaurants
in Manhattan.

77
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:26,097
I gave her
Paulina's uniform.

78
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:29,133
- Hi.

79
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,802
Mr. Lee,
not to complain,

80
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:35,272
but I think someone
wore this uniform before me,

81
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:37,958
like right before me.

82
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,693
Is it possible
that I could get another one?

83
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:43,531
Maybe one that's
a little less moist.

84
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,951
Also this mustard color doesn't
really go with my skin tone,

85
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:49,954
neither do
the mustard stains...

86
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:52,406
And these
various other stains,

87
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,909
and smells.
I hope that's clam chowder.

88
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:57,161
So...

89
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:58,862
I think it'd be better
for everyone,

90
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,198
including
my immune system,

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,534
if I just keep on wearing
what I'm wearing,

92
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:06,370
and not the apron,
'cause this is chanel.

93
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,556
- [Laughs]
- So thank you,

94
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:11,308
and let's waitress.

95
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,398
- Whatever that is,

96
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,066
it does not belong
in this diner.

97
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:21,152
It belongs
in a show on bravo.

98
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:25,722
- But she blonde,
hair so shiny,

99
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,358
good for business.

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,059
- Where do you even
find these people?

101
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,363
The Russian hooker, the one
before that was a meth addict.

102
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,165
- You train her,
I am boss.

103
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:37,368
<i>Da boss.
- Oh.</i>

104
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,703
- Fine, but make her
wear the uniform.

105
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,038
- [Sighs]

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,506
- Are you sure we can't get
the meth addict back?

107
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:45,742
She was really good
at cleaning.

108
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,295
- But her teeth
fall out.

109
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,718
- You are really judgmental,
you know that?

110
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:59,807
I'm only gonna say this once,
so pay attention.

111
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,243
- I'm Caroline, by the way.
And you're Max?

112
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:06,614
- Don't get attached.

113
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:09,066
This is the Williamsburg diner,
owned by Han Lee,

114
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:10,734
who just changed his name
to Bryce Lee,

115
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:14,822
because I guess he wants people
to take him even less seriously.

116
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:16,657
Eight months ago he bought it
from the Russian mob.

117
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:19,493
Clientele used to be
all eastern bloc criminals

118
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:22,296
and crack whores, but then
he took it over and ruined it.

119
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,635
- Hey, sexy woman.

120
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,637
You look so pretty today.

121
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,291
You look so beautiful, I forgot
how bad your personality is.

122
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,595
- Thanks, Oleg.

123
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:40,347
- Hey, Barbie.

124
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,188
- He will hit on you
aggressively and relentlessly.

125
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,656
He doesn't realize
he looks like that,

126
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:52,142
and I don't have the heart
to tell him.

127
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,494
- Could we have some menus?

128
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,745
- Oh, sure.

129
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,997
- Don't smile.

130
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,782
'Cause it raises the bar,
and then I have to smile,

131
00:05:58,784 --> 00:05:59,917
and I can't be doing that.

132
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,820
It's exhausting
and I have a bad back.

133
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,457
That's Earl,
we're in love.

134
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,708
Do not talk to him,

135
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,127
unless you want to feel whiter
than you already are.

136
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:12,630
Oh, and that stain?

137
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:15,666
Not clam chowder.

138
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,018
Go marry the ketchups.

139
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,689
- Marry the ketchups.
I'm on it.

140
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:37,871
Okay.
Now divorce the ketchups.

141
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,160
- Stop.
Just stop.

142
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:45,045
There's no such thing
as divorcing the ketchups.

143
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:46,830
You've never waitressed
a day in your life.

144
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:47,864
- Yes, I have.

145
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,083
- You expect me
to believe you

146
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:52,035
after watching that whole
temple grandin routine?

147
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,454
I'm telling Lee.
- Okay, okay,

148
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,339
I may have enhanced
my resume.

149
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:59,176
- Enhanced?
What, are we in Paris?

150
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:01,478
- Please,
I really need this job, okay?

151
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,930
We lost all of our money.

152
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:05,482
My trust fund was taken
for legal fees.

153
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,017

154
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:09,553

Where's the paper?

00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,410
Martin Channing?

157
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:18,779
The guy who ripped off
the entire city is your father.

158
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:22,533
- He told us we were
having a good year.

159
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:24,385
- You're
Caroline Channing.

160
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:26,203
You're like
a billionaire.

161
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,672
- Was.
Was a billionaire.

162
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:30,924
They froze all our assets,
everything's gone.

163
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:32,743
I only have
what I could grab,

164
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,179
and I grabbed
all the wrong things.

165
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:37,931
- So do you know the president?
- I've met him.

166
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,266
- He's hot.
- He's the president.

167
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:40,884
- Have you been to Switzerland?
- Yes.

168
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,269
- Do you have a horse?
- Yes.

169
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:46,557
- Do you know Paris Hilton?
- No, she's a hundred.

170
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,759
- Excuse me, uh,
two hot chocolate, please.

171
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,027
- Comin' up.
- It...

172
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:51,729
let me do that, please.

173
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,063
I'm a really
fast learner.

174
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,365

Wharton business school.

00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:44,765
- Him, Robbie?

349
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,817
- It's none of my business,

350
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,720
but you deserve better
than that guy.

351
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:52,406
- [Sighs] Yeah,
it is none of your business.

352
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:55,025
Ooh, I was just starting
to feel sorry for you.

353
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:58,579
- I'm just saying,
you're worth more than that.

354
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,664
- What, I'm supposed to
believe you about this?

355
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,700
The person who lied
on their resume,

356
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:04,402
and lied about the cupcakes...
you're a liar.

357
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:07,855
- I'm just trying to help.
- You know what?

358
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:10,174
Since you seem to know
so much about everything,

359
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:11,792
why don't you
take your wharton degree,

360
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,411
and your ridiculous coat, and
figure this all out yourself.

361
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:15,546
- Max.

362
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,348
Max, wait.
- Oh, look,

363
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,600
the arcade fire concert
just let out across the street,

364
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:21,435
good luck with that.

365
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:23,354
- She's coming back,
right?

366
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:24,588
She's not gonna
leave me here alone

367
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,557
with a restaurant
full of people?

368
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,026
- Let me put it to you
this way.

369
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,110
You might as well be

370
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:33,947
a night maid
at the Schwarzenegger house.

371
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:36,933
You got screwed.

372
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:47,024
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

373
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:49,861
[Tambourine hits]
That feels so good.

374
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:51,329
Now put your tambourine
around it.

375
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:52,363
[Tambourine shakes]

376
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:54,632
- [Sighs]

377
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,417
- Hi, honey, I'm home.

378
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:57,836
[Thump]

379
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:01,840
- I want you gone
by the time I get back.

380
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:04,208
- Babe!
Babe, I can explain.

381
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:08,530
You weren't
supposed to be home.

382
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:09,848
- People say
I deserve better than you.

383
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,599
- Who?

384
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:14,185
That blonde girl? She doesn't
know what she's talkin' about.

385
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:16,888
- She went to Wharton

386
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,389
and Switzerland.

387
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,368
- Yo, yo.
Look at that.

388
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,120
That girl is
workin' harder

389
00:18:32,122 --> 00:18:36,508
than Stephen Hawking tryin'
to put in a pair of cufflinks.

390
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:40,461
- Here, let me help you
with that.

391
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:41,629
- I don't need any help.

392
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:44,182
- Everyone needs help
sometimes.

393
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:53,308
- This isn't
what I ordered.

394
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,976
- This is Caroline.

395
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:56,227
She may have gotten
your order wrong,

396
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:58,196
but she does
get some things right.

397
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,436
Thank you.

398
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:08,122
- No, thank you.

399
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:10,375
What'd you see in that guy,
anyway?

400
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:12,460
- He had these
muscle thingies.

401
00:19:12,462 --> 00:19:15,413
- Oh, those things?
- Yeah.

402
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:16,581
I don't know
what those are called,

403
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,467
but they make smart girls
stupid.

404
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:20,785
- Max!

405
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:22,971
I thought your tight ass
wasn't coming in tonight,

406
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:26,341
and my heart
broke in half.

407
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:29,127
- You know what, Oleg?

408
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:30,962
I needed that.

409
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:39,637
So, um...

410
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:41,906
I need a roommate,
if you want to crash.

411
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:43,241
- Hmm.

412
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:48,029
Not gonna lie, the subway's
cleaner than your couch.

413
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:50,198
- [Laughs] Wow.

414
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,283
I just felt myself
starting to like you.

415
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:54,002
- Really? Because I really feel
like we could...

416
00:19:54,004 --> 00:19:56,955
- [giggles]
I knew that wouldn't last.

417
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:59,173
Come on.

418
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,675
Tomorrow we can
go into the city

419
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,260
and get
the rest of your stuff.

420
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:04,512
- Everything's locked up.

421
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:07,715
- What, you have nothing that
you care about that we can get?

422
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:09,267
- Well,
there is one thing.

423
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:14,522
- The weirdest thing
is that nobody stopped us.

424
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:17,692
- I'm gonna save
a fortune,

425
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:20,111
keeping him here
instead of in the stables.

426
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:24,565
- When did you put this whole
horse-in-my-yard thing together?

427
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,733
- I can't help it.

428
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:27,685
I see an opportunity,
and I make it happen,

429
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,821
like with your cupcakes.

430
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,906
- Like what
with my cupcakes?

431
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:34,375
- Ready?
To open a bake shop,

432
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:36,544
all we need is
250 grand start-up money,

433
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:37,962
for the real estate,
and the basic equipment...

434
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:40,214
- yeah. Oh.

435
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:42,634
250 grand, that's all?
- Yeah.

436
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:44,419
- Did freakin' Chestnut here
kick you in the head

437
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:46,054
while I was in Starbucks?

438
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:47,305
- Hear me out.

439
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:50,008
If we both worked two jobs
and made $2,000 a week,

440
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,477
we could open a cupcake business
in a little over a year.

441
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:55,463
In the past two days,
we've made $387,

442
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:56,714
and that's a good start.

443
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:57,932
We can make extra money
at other jobs,

444
00:20:57,934 --> 00:21:00,435
like publicists,
advertising executives...

445
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:03,888
- janitors, drug mules.

446
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:07,742
- We really need to
work on your self-esteem.

447
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:08,826
So...

448
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:11,395
You, cupcakes,
me, business background,

449
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:15,216
us, success.
What do you think?

450
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,252
- I think
you have a horse.

451
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:21,255
- I think we have a horse.

452
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:24,175
- [Whinnies]

453
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:26,961
- Don't get attached.
