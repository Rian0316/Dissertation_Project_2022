I had the biggest crush on you
in high school, Craig.

21
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:22,860
My God, you're beautiful.

22
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,397
I love you.

23
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:27,032
Dead people poop themselves.

24
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,602
Dead people poop themselves.

25
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:32,405
What?

26
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:35,809
Dead people poop themselves.

27
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:37,578
Debs!

28
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:39,580
Harry pooped himself
after he died.

29
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:41,616
Harry?

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,286
Aunt ginger's boyfriend.
Mm.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,321
I'm going back to sleep.

32
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,123
He was my first dead person.

33
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,159
Mm. Finishing
my nice dream now.

34
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,429
There are 200 euphemisms
for death.

35
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:53,730
Kicked the bucket,

36
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,799
met his maker, ate dirt.

37
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,601
Six Feet
Under, Pushing Daisies.

38
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:00,404
Can't a brother get some sleep
around here?

39
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:02,640
Bit the dust,
bought a pine condo.

40
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:05,610
Went off the twig.

41
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:08,780
Basted the formaldehyde turkey.

42
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:11,584
Mm, winning one for the reaper.

43
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:12,985
Living impaired.

44
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,420
Past his sell-by date.

45
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:17,957
Just add maggots.

46
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,127
Mm...

47
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:23,463
Retroactive abortion.

48
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:28,134
Lip? Yo!

49
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:29,869
Hey.

50
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:32,538
Colonel McNally's gonna
meet us on the lower level.

51
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,974
Hey, that weed you gave
me worked like a charm.

52
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,809
Yeah, you used it on your
poetry-loving grad student?

53
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:38,210
Rachel. Very hot.

54
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:40,479
She loved the playlist
that you made for me.

55
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:43,216
She was so impressed with
my collection of urban music

56
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,684
that she let me go down on her.

57
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,453
Wow.
The alphabet-- That's the key.

58
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,988
Drives them wild.

59
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:50,290
If you're really good, you'll
never get to the letter Z.

60
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:52,326
My record is M.
There he is.

61
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,794
Gentlemen.

62
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:56,630
Lip, this is
Colonel Kirk McNally.

63
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:58,465
This is Phillip Gallagher,
who I was telling you about.

64
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,301
He's very interested
in talking to you. Oh.

65
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:01,669
He is one of
the brightest kids I know.

66
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,404
Vowels.

67
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,839
Anywhere to get an
espresso around here?

68
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:07,041
Uh, take you to the cafeteria.

69
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:08,843
So, what are you
working on this summer?

70
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:10,344
I'm working on this device

71
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,747
that reads credit card numbers
off of parking kiosks.

72
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:15,149
Using a magnetic stripe reader?
Oh, no.

73
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:17,384
Card numbers aren't actually
held on the cards anymore.

74
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,086
It's all done over wi-fi now.

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,521
Why aren't you
working on my project?

76
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:21,755
I gave hurst a big grant.

77
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,490
Yeah, I'm still
in high school, so...

78
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:25,993
What? What are
we doing here?

79
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:27,594
Why am I wasting my time?

80
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:29,663
I was hoping you could tell me
a little bit about West Point.

81
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:31,064
Oh.

82
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,334
Like, uh, what's a kid got
to do to get in?

83
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:36,036
Suck my dick.

84
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:37,371
I'll tell you what.

85
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,874
If you're as smart
as hurst says you are,

86
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:41,375
work on my project.

87
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,878
I'll tell you all
about west point.

88
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:49,951
Don't use wooden clips

89
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:51,785
on my bras.
They'll snag.

90
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,220
Use plastic ones.

91
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,222
Okay, sure.

92
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:58,292
You worked for the city, right?
Cdot was it?

93
00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:00,094
Is this us getting
to know each other?

94
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,195
Yeah, I painted curbs.

95
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,764
Someone does that?

96
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:05,132
You think they
paint themselves?

97
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,701
Thought there was
a machine or something.

98
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:09,102
A machine called
Dorothy Coronis.

99
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,903
For 23 years.
You're welcome.

100
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:13,105
23 years?
That's a nice pension.

101
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,242
Too bad I won't live
long enough to collect.

102
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:17,643
You been dating anyone

103
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:20,280
since Charlie stroked out
on the toilet?

104
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:21,715
There's been a few.

105
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:24,251
Give or take a couple of dozen.

106
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,785
Anyone special?

107
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,620
What do I want
someone special for?

108
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:29,456
To be under foot all the time?

109
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,891
No, thanks.

110
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:32,558
I have Rochelle, Evelyn,

111
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:35,061
Kermit, my cat snowshoes.

112
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:38,231
Kermit?
Yeah, from down at the bar.

113
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,766
He's been coming around here?

114
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,134
We're friends.

115
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,435
I don't trust him.

116
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,738
His features
are too close together.

117
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,409
He's been doing
some electrical work for me.

118
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:53,345
Yeah, electrical work, my ass.

119
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:58,150
Fi, you home?

120
00:04:58,184 --> 00:04:59,618
Upstairs.

121
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:01,620
My mom needs help down
at her salon tomorrow. You in?

122
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:02,988
Sure.

123
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,190
Wow. Middle-of-the-day makeup.

124
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:06,625
What's the occasion?

125
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:08,126
Craig Heisner texted me back.
Who?

126
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:10,029
That guy
from my high school diary.

127
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:13,198
Asked if I wanted to have coffee.
Coffee coffee, or banging coffee?

128
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,935
He's married. I don't need
somebody else's backwash.

129
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:18,671
So you won't be getting up
on my Kevin anytime soon?

130
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:20,439
Ew. He's like my brother.

131
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:22,307
Plus, it'd be like
making out with you.

132
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:23,709
Bitch, you know you want to.

133
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:24,710
So, why you meeting
with Craig Heisner then?

134
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:26,144
Connect with an old friend.

135
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:27,479
I'm curious to see how he looks.

136
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:29,047
Bet he thinks
you're gonna hook up.

137
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,215
Hmm... he can think
whatever he wants.

138
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:32,316
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

139
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,951
Why else would
a married man be meeting up

140
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:35,385
with his old flame?
We were never old flames.

141
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,621
He barely noticed me
in high school.

142
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:40,624
Oh, so you're going there
to make him jealous?

143
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,793
Here's what you could
have had, Craig Heisner.

144
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:44,128
Oh-doh, ooh-doh...

145
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,631
Does everything have to
be an ass shake with you?

146
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:48,365
Sometimes it's a boob shake.

147
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,868
Okay, how do I look?

148
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:52,403
Like me.

149
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:55,239
Oh, shit.

150
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,675
Hey, you filthy
fuckin' "portagese"!

151
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,210
I know you fucked my sister.

152
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:00,978
I'm gonna come down there,

153
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,347
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

154
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:03,815
Stan, what are you doing?

155
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,350
Get in here. You're
gonna get shot.

156
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:07,018
Yeah.
Put some pants on.

157
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:10,021
I got pants on. Really?
Then those are the ugliest

158
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:12,524
pair of flesh pants
I've ever seen. Oh.

159
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:15,393
Oh, Dinty Moore again?

160
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,095
Oh, come on.
You love this stuff.

161
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,698
Yeah, but don't give me the one
with the low sodium.

162
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:21,200
It tastes like dog shit.

163
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:23,202
What, and the one
with full sodium doesn't?

164
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:24,837
No, actually, it's delicious.

165
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:28,842
So, I could pick up a pile
of dog shit and you'd eat it?

166
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:31,078
Well, if it had enough salt on it.

167
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:33,347
I'll keep that
in mind. Here.

168
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,748
What the hell is that?

169
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,617
The receipts from
the bar last night.

170
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:37,952
Bar? What bar?

171
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,454
The alibi room.

172
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:40,955
Downstairs.
You own it.

173
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:42,456
Oh, I know that.

174
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,957
Just give me the goddamn money.

175
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,901
♪ Words take shape
like guns and planes... ♪

176
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:56,770
Here we go.

177
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,138
Thanks.

178
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:04,378
So,

179
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:05,779
Fiona Gallagher.

180
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:08,115
Craig Heisner.
You look good.

181
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,750
You, too.

182
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:12,119
So, what have you been
up to since graduation?

183
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:13,721
I never graduated.

184
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:16,825
My mom split my junior year,
so, I had to quit school,

185
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,159
take care of the family.

186
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:21,162
Oh, that sucks.
It is what it is.

187
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:23,498
What'd you do after graduation?

188
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:26,067
Went into business with my dad.
Concrete.

189
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,568
That's good.

190
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:28,969
Yeah.

191
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,005
I was surprised
to hear from you on Facebook.

192
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,773
I didn't think
you'd remember me.

193
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:36,342
How could I not? You had the
best ass in the sophomore class.

194
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:38,745
I can still picture
you in those sexy shorts

195
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,648
running track during
our football practices.

196
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:43,751
Did you know
I had a crush on you?

197
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:46,921
Back then or now?

198
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:48,189
I might have had an inkling.

199
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,426
♪ Who is right?
Who is wrong? ♪

200
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,797
♪ who is weak?
Who is stronger now? ♪

201
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,334
So, how come
you never jumped me?

202
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:01,770
Oh, I was afraid
you might reject me.

203
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:03,438
No, no, no.
You never jumped me, either.

204
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,674
You were a senior,
I was a sophomore.

205
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,542
And for the record, you know,

206
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:10,712
I wouldn't have rejected you.
Oh, now you tell me.

207
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,947
Besides, you were always
with that bitchy cheerleader.

208
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:15,382
What was her name?
Lucy Joe?

209
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,117
Yeah.

210
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:19,453
You mean my wife?

211
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,021
Oh, shit. Sorry.

212
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:23,157
It's cool.

213
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:27,161
You guys still together?

214
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,463
We had a few breakups,
but for the most part,

215
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:31,065
we've been together
since we were 15.

216
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,967
What about you?

217
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:36,670
We <i>haven't</i> been together
since we were 15.

218
00:08:36,704 --> 00:08:39,406
There's nothing we can do
about that now, can we?

219
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,876
Nah. You had
to go mess everything up

220
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,244
by getting married.

221
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,980
We would have been
good together, too.

222
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:48,650
Probably, yeah,
would've been great.

223
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:51,320
I guess we'll never
find out now.

224
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,689
Guess not.

225
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:04,166
Dude, stop. It's the best
way to get six-pack abs.

226
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,835
Saw it on a YouTube video.
Hey, fuckwad?

227
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,003
Dickhead.

228
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:10,271
What are you doing?
Helping Ian train.

229
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,941
Yo, I was at the lab talking to
this army guy from the Pentagon.

230
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:15,443
He's a colonel or something.
Oh, yeah?

231
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:17,112
Yeah. Thought he
could tell us

232
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:18,713
a little bit more
about west point.

233
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:20,181
He was a student there.

234
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:21,783
They're called cadets.

235
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,719
♪ I will burn for you ♪

236
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:26,388
♪ feel pain for you ♪

237
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:29,225
♪ I will twist the knife ♪

238
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:32,362
♪ and bleed my aching heart. ♪

239
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,031
What's up with debs?

240
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:36,233
Obsessed with death.

241
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:39,135
Anyway, thought this guy
might be a good lead.

242
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:40,703
I don't know.

243
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:43,238
Took that practice
trig test today, only got a 73.

244
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:45,307
Five points higher
than last time.

245
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,908
I cheated.

246
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:49,444
Why do you want to go
in the army anyway?

247
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:51,278
You're just gonna get shot
through the butthole in battle.

248
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:53,580
Hey, twat bag, the only reason
you're not in summer school

249
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:55,282
is 'cause they
wouldn't have you.

250
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,587
I hate when they bunt.
It's a pussy move.

251
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,455
You're such a girl.

252
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,624
Don't make me pull out my penis,
prove you wrong.

253
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:07,494
Stan's losing his marbles.

254
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:08,928
What happened?
You're right.

255
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,330
He shouldn't be left
alone up there.

256
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:11,765
Call his daughter.

257
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,232
What if she wants
to put him in a home?

258
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,601
Well, might be
the best thing for him.

259
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:16,002
He wants to stay
in his apartment.

260
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:17,504
So did my mother, even after

261
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:19,606
she started shitting
in the kitchen drawers.

262
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,109
Hey, what about you and me--
We chip in, we buy the bar?

263
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,811
What?

264
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,780
It'll give him enough money
for round-the-clock care.

265
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:28,281
Not interested.

266
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:31,084
When he goes, someone's
gonna buy this place.

267
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:32,752
What if they turned it
into a Friday's or something?

268
00:10:32,787 --> 00:10:34,287
I look good in red
and white stripes.

269
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:36,189
We buy the bar from Stan,

270
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:38,658
he gets to stay in his
apartment, and we keep our jobs.

271
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,527
No.
Why not?

272
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:41,995
Because I like making
my hundred bucks a night,

273
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,032
skimming a few dollars
off the top, then, going home

274
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,435
and not thinking about
this place until I come back.

275
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:49,336
Fine, I'll buy it myself.
You can't even total out

276
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:50,871
the register.

277
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:52,306
That's because it's your job.

278
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,440
Where are you gonna get
the money?

279
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:55,109
I'll take out a loan.

280
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,210
Hmm. Good luck with that.

281
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:58,378
Kermit!

282
00:10:58,413 --> 00:10:59,947
My buddy!
What's the haps?

283
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:01,714
I'm not sure what that
means, Frank, but...

284
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:03,049
Life's good.
Glad to hear it.

285
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,884
Where you been, Frank?
Haven't seen you in a while.

286
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:07,319
Working. Lunch break.
Give me three shots.

287
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:10,189
Throw in a pickled egg,
too, will you?

288
00:11:10,223 --> 00:11:11,690
You still with that girlfriend

289
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:12,658
of yours?

290
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:14,326
Estelle, isn't it?
Cynthia.

291
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,627
Cynthia. That's it.

292
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:17,396
She's a keeper.
Hang on to her.

293
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,031
I plan to.
Yah.

294
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,534
Don't want to cheat on her,

295
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,336
mess up a good thing, Kermit.

296
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,572
Okay.

297
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:27,507
Kermit.

298
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:30,210
Interesting name.

299
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,045
Like the frog, right?

300
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,247
It's a family name.

301
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:35,750
Gaelic-- Means
"without envy."

302
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:38,385
Way before the frog.

303
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:42,155
Someone was just
mentioning you to me.

304
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,490
Who was that?

305
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:44,825
Oh, that-that's right.

306
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:46,359
Um, Dottie Coronis.

307
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:47,594
Nice girl.

308
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:50,330
We've known each other
since confirmation.

309
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,165
Said something about you
doing some electrical work.

310
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,733
Yeah, I been doing a few things

311
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:55,267
around her place.
Probably

312
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:56,902
paint her house
later this week.

313
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:59,338
Whew!
That's a big job.

314
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:02,241
Yep. Anything else going on?

315
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:03,442
What do you mean?

316
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:04,544
You know.

317
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:05,711
Frank...

318
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:07,246
She's dying.

319
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:08,881
I-I'm helping her out.

320
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,450
That's what friends do

321
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:12,619
for each other.
Friends that want something?

322
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:13,553
What are you talking about?

323
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,355
Let's get one thing
straight, Kermit.

324
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,557
I'm on to you.

325
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:17,625
So you stay away from

326
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:19,960
butterface if you know
what's good for you.

327
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,635
What the hell's wrong with him?

328
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,269
Got a couple hours?

329
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:51,651
Hello?

330
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:52,752
Hey, you remember me?

331
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:54,153
We just had coffee together.

332
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:55,655
Short black guy, right?

333
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:56,823
That's the one.

334
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:59,158
So that was fun.
Yeah, it was.

335
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,060
I hope I was a gentleman.

336
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,795
Of course you were.

337
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:05,431
Okay, good, 'cause I wouldn't
want you to get the wrong idea.

338
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:06,732
About what?

339
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,633
Well, it's just that I like you,

340
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:11,436
and, uh, if I weren't married
maybe things would be different.

341
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,004
But you are.

342
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,406
I kn... right, of course.
I mean, I-don't even know

343
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:18,008
if you'd want to be with me
if I weren't married.

344
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,843
You had your chance.

345
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:20,778
I did?

346
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:21,778
In high school.

347
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:23,179
I told you that already.

348
00:13:23,214 --> 00:13:26,615
Oh, right. I thought you were
talking about at coffee.

349
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,983
No.

350
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,617
Not your thing.

351
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,318
Nope.

352
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,987
That's good.
I like that about you.

353
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,456
Shows character.
Not many girls are like that.

354
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,924
Is it <i>your</i> thing?

355
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,960
Not up to this point.

356
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:42,596
Although if you had thrown
yourself at me this afternoon,

357
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,032
who knows if I could've controlled myself?
Then I promise I never will.

358
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,867
But what if I want to test it,

359
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:49,469
see if I can hold out?

360
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:51,171
You wouldn't be able to.

361
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,273
Now you've just given me
something to think about

362
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:54,474
on my drive home.

363
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:56,376
Thank you

364
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,678
for having coffee with me,
Ms. Fiona Gallagher.

365
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,546
You're welcome, Craig Heisner.

366
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,483
My wife says it's bad luck
to put your purse on the floor.

367
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:05,483
What?

368
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:08,519
Like throwing money
out the window.

369
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:09,720
You should pick it up.

370
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:10,854
Oh.

371
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:12,355
Okay.

372
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,291
Thanks.

373
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:30,504
Now I know why they call it

374
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,572
a world-famous salad bar.

375
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,340
My steak is too rare.

376
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,908
Have this one, king Henry.

377
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,578
Hey, what was the final tally
in the purse?

378
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,247
526 bucks.

379
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,248
Who carries around
that kind of cash?

380
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,716
Uh...

381
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,986
- Kim Furtado.
- Some rich bitch.

382
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,920
In our neighborhood?

383
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,321
Uh, I was up in Glencoe

384
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,189
having coffee with a friend
from high school.

385
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:54,424
That guy from your diary?

386
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,426
Shut up, and eat
your spaghetti taco.

387
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,827
You think it's real?
And if so,

388
00:14:58,862 --> 00:14:59,995
can I have it?
Yeah, it is.

389
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,330
The L-V's are two inches apart,

390
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:03,032
seams are even,
stitching's yellow,

391
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:04,734
and the leather has
turned dark brown

392
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,037
from oxidation.

393
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:08,572
I read a lot.

394
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:10,907
Debs.

395
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,909
Have more salad--
It's all-you-can-eat.

396
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:14,444
In some parts of India.

397
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,547
They leave dead bodies in the
street to be eaten by vultures.

398
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,349
I can't wait to die.

399
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:20,450
Why?

400
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:22,018
To be closer to God.

401
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,187
If it weren't a sin,
I'd kill myself

402
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:27,090
so that it could happen sooner.

403
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,458
Um, hey, Fi.

404
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,459
Hm? Know what you should do?

405
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,527
Ride the L more often?

406
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:33,362
I think I found her home number.

407
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:34,697
Tell her you
found her purse--

408
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,399
I bet she'll give you a reward.

409
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:40,303
Shit, it went to voicemail--
Leave a message.

410
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:42,105
Hi, Kim.

411
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,940
Uh, my name's Fiona.

412
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,776
I found your purse on the L.

413
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,578
Um, give me a call back
on your cell

414
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,814
so that I can get it
back to you. Okay, bye.

415
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,617
Perfect. Now,
don't give it back

416
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,553
unless she gives you
at least 200 bucks.

417
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,155
That's how much we can
get for it on eBay.

418
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,590
All right, you guys...

419
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,625
Let's go stock up on
chicken nuggets for home.

420
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,393
I heart sizzler.

421
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,663
You know, it's a good thing that
I met up with Craig Heisner.

422
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,433
Otherwise I never would've found the purse.
He's married.

423
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,470
I'm talking about the purse.

424
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,474
Sheils!

425
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,109
Door!

426
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,346
Karen?

427
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,749
Door!

428
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh, goddamn it!

429
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,457
Karen's not here.

430
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:33,161
I know. She's working
at the tanning salon.

431
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,097
Thanks for the update.

432
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:37,032
Actually, I came to see you.

433
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm busy.

434
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:41,171
I want to marry Karen.

435
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,707
Well, what do I give a shit for?

436
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:46,043
Hoping to get your blessing.

437
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:47,711
I, uh...

438
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:49,647
Got her a ring.

439
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:52,550
Microscope come with that?

440
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:58,356
You know what?

441
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,158
Congratulations!

442
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:02,293
Why don't you, um...

443
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,662
Why don't you go get us
a couple of beers

444
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,397
out of the fridge?
Let's celebrate!

445
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:07,531
Great!

446
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,881
I will stab you
until you bleed to death

447
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:26,251
- if you don't quit it out!
- Yo, buddy!

448
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,886
Shut up!

449
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,188
Yeah?

450
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:31,423
Look, you got to get a job
this summer so we can

451
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,691
make it through the
winter, all right?

452
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,326
I've been helping Debbie
with day care.

453
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:37,263
Eating all the mac and cheese is
not helping out, bud. Need to put

454
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,932
a thousand bucks in the squirrel
fund before you go back to school.

455
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:42,502
Debs! Carl! A little help.

456
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:44,604
- Go help your sister.
- Help?

457
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:47,507
Oh, is this from
the purse windfall?

458
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,607
The gift that keeps on giving.

459
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,109
Waffles!

460
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:52,945
Blueberry pancakes in there,
french toast,

461
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,681
and scrambled egg whites with
sausage for Lieutenant Gallagher.

462
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:57,049
Thanks, Fi.
Newspaper.

463
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,350
Thank you.

464
00:17:58,384 --> 00:17:59,518
New socks, Carl.

465
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,187
Throw out the ones
with the holes in 'em.

466
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:02,755
- Awesome!
- Manicure?

467
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,125
Treated myself.
Oh.

468
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,461
19 people died
in Chicago yesterday.

469
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,729
Carton of smokes for you, Lip.

470
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:11,265
Wow. This guy died
of heat exhaustion.

471
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,699
He was only 54.

472
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:14,969
People can die from heat exhaustion?
Okay,

473
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:16,304
put the rest of this stuff away.

474
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:18,072
I gotta go meet
the rich purse woman.

475
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:19,707
Oh, she called?
This morning.

476
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,775
Hey, remember,

477
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,376
no reward, no purse.

478
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:26,780
Knock, knock.

479
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,549
What's all this?

480
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,452
Uh, Kermit can't paint
your house this week.

481
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,621
Something about his
herpes acting up.

482
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,922
I think he got it

483
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:36,924
from that girlfriend of his.

484
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,492
So I'm gonna do it.

485
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:41,295
I brought you a couple of
things I thought you could use.

486
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,830
Batteries for your beeper.

487
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,731
Working.

488
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,132
Those DVD's you wanted.

489
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,000
They were, like, 20 bucks each,

490
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:49,903
but don't worry about
it-- It's on the me.

491
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:52,338
<i>Terms of endearment,</i>
<i>misery,</i> and <i>beaches,</i>

492
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,173
starring that guy Bette Midler.

493
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,809
One more thing.

494
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,977
What the hell's that?

495
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,646
An engagement ring.

496
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:04,516
It's a little small,

497
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,785
don't you think?
They were out of the big ones.

498
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,187
Who's it for?
You.

499
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:10,856
You're not serious.

500
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,591
Serious as a heart attack.

501
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,261
Sorry, that was in poor taste.

502
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,663
You want to marry me?

503
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,432
Sure.

504
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:22,268
I could get my new heart
any time now, live a long life.

505
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:24,537
Well, then let's
live it together.

506
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:26,171
I'm not sure I want to get stuck

507
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,673
looking at your mug
for the rest

508
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,842
of my life.
I'll wear a bag over my head.

509
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:36,649
Sometimes you're funny,
Gallagher.

510
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,289
Hell, who am I kidding?
I might only have

511
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:45,558
a few weeks
if my pager never beeps.

512
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,794
Don't you want to die
knowing someone loved you.

513
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:50,030
You don't love me.

514
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,365
You're kind of growing on me.

515
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,533
What is this about, Frank?

516
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,034
You trying to get my pension?

517
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,836
You have a pension?

518
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,170
I told you.

519
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:00,573
And I may be dead
way before I can collect it.

520
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:03,075
Yes. But...
When you die--

521
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,578
And let's hope that's not
for another 20 years--

522
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,547
Your pension automatically
goes to your spouse.

523
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,282
What spouse?

524
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:14,852
Oh, for Christ sakes!

525
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,521
I've busted my ass around here!

526
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:19,022
It's only been two weeks.

527
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,757
Dottie...

528
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:25,329
You worked for the
city for 23 years.

529
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:28,766
28, if you count the five I
scraped gum off the sidewalk.

530
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,902
All the money you
put in your pension

531
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:32,437
will go to waste.

532
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:34,238
You worked goddamn hard for it.

533
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:35,773
Why should you get it?

534
00:20:37,242 --> 00:20:39,410
Because I'll keep
your memory alive.

535
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:42,613
Tomorrow,

536
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,915
we'll go down to city
hall and get hitched.

537
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,352
And when you pass, I'll light
a candle for you every day.

538
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:51,521
I'll make sure the priest at
St. Thomas Moore gives a mass

539
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:53,023
in your honor once a month.

540
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:55,025
And I'll put flowers
on your grave

541
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,727
at easter and mother's day...

542
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,262
And your birthday.

543
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:00,898
I'll even make sure Kevin
names a drink after you

544
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,934
down at the alibi.

545
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,136
And every night at last call,

546
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,705
we'll have a toast,

547
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:08,940
and drink to Dottie Coronis.

548
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:15,080
I won't let you
be forgotten, Dot.

549
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,150
Okay.

550
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:21,452
Okay?

551
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,387
I'll be your wife.

552
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:26,323
Well, hot dog!
That's my girl!

553
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:18,942
Yes?

554
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:19,843
Kim?

555
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:21,345
Can I help you?
Guys!

556
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:24,849
Go dump out the Legos and mama'll
be in to play in a minute.

557
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,718
Uh, uh, I have your purse.

558
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:28,219
Oh! Thank you!

559
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:29,888
Sorry, I didn't mean
to be a bitch.

560
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:32,290
Kids are driving me insane today.
It's okay.

561
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:34,393
I should get going.

562
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:39,064
It's Fiona, right?
Yeah.

563
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,800
We just moved in.
Some of the neighbors

564
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:42,168
aren't too pleased
with all the noise.

565
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:44,237
I thought you might be one of them.
Oh, God, no.

566
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:45,840
I live on the South side.

567
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,042
Oh, I'm from Kenwood.

568
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:48,576
Back of the yards!

569
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,246
Shoot, you didn't see any
money in here, did you?

570
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:53,983
No, I just looked for your
license and cell, that's it.

571
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:55,986
I had, like, 500 bucks;
it was my rent.

572
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,055
That sucks.

573
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:01,025
Bet some derelict on
the train snagged it.

574
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:02,059
I'm sorry.

575
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:03,661
Do you want to
come in for coffee?

576
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:06,398
I can't, I got to get to work.

577
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:07,999
Well, thanks again, it's nice

578
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,701
to know there are kind
people out there. Bye.

579
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,771
Guys, calm down.

580
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:17,508
What's all this stuff?

581
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:20,010
Fiona bought us breakfast with
the money she found on the L.

582
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:21,946
Sweet.

583
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,548
So Stan's not doing too good.

584
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,383
Aw, you want me to go over,
do my dance for him,

585
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:26,751
make him feel better?

586
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,554
Nah, I think
he's past the dance.

587
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:30,589
Looks like he's gonna need
around-the-clock care soon.

588
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:31,791
Hmm, can he afford that?

589
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,126
Funny you should ask.

590
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,861
I have a plan.
Uh-oh.

591
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:36,596
What uh-oh?
Sometimes your plans

592
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,065
can be a little crazy-pants,
Kev-- Case in point.

593
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:40,132
Yeah, but you like
that plan now.

594
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,801
I'm on the road to liking it.

595
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:44,804
I think you're going
to like this plan.

596
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:47,373
I'm gonna buy
the bar from Stan.

597
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:48,874
What?
The alibi room--

598
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:50,976
I'm gonna buy it.
With what, your silver chains?

599
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:52,811
No, I'm gonna go
to the loan store today

600
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:53,913
and pick up some forms.

601
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:54,914
You mean the bank?

602
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:56,316
Yeah.

603
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,918
That's a big step.

604
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,787
If I buy the bar, then
Stan will have enough cash

605
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:02,055
to pay for in-home care.

606
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,457
He won't have to go
to some shithole

607
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:05,559
old folks home like
where you work.

608
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:08,595
That's a good idea.
Thank you.

609
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,132
V?

610
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,170
It's a great idea.

611
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,605
That's a stupid idea.

612
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,474
I know, but I couldn't
tell him the truth.

613
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:21,309
He would suck at owning the bar.
Honey, he would suck

614
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:22,844
at organizing
his underwear drawer.

615
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,178
That's why he doesn't wear
clean ones.

616
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,413
How much does a bar cost?

617
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:27,849
More than the $85
we have in the bank.

618
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,751
My girls give good head,
don't they, ladies?

619
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:31,652
Louise is
ready for you, Vickie.

620
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,321
Come on, baby.

621
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,957
I'm gonna pay that
purse woman back.

622
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,024
Why?

623
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,425
She was nice.

624
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,426
Not rich at all.

625
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:40,695
I feel bad.

626
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,030
She had a bunch of
kids running around.

627
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,097
Well, you'll just return

628
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:44,866
the next Louis Vuitton you find.

629
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,501
I'd want the money back
if it happened to me.

630
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,636
Yeah, well, you wouldn't
leave your purse on the L.

631
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:50,505
She deserves what she got
for being dumb.

632
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,108
Mama, should Fiona give that
woman her money back or keep it?

633
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,311
Well, depends on where you
want to spend eternity--

634
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:57,713
Rooming with Mother Teresa

635
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,781
or Osama Bin laden.

636
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:01,683
I'm giving it back.

637
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,551
I thought you spent it all
on shrimp and waffles.

638
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:08,189
No, I have $112 left,
so I need $414 more.

639
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,791
Picked up an extra shift
at the club tonight.

640
00:25:09,826 --> 00:25:11,694
I'm just going to bust my ass
till I make it.

641
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:15,231
You gonna just keep
that dollar in your hand?

642
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,833
Thank you.

643
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:33,150
So how's your, uh, boyfriend

644
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,718
Joey?
Jody.

645
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:35,986
Right.
Good.

646
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,220
Looking for a job.

647
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:38,655
Hmm.
How's Ian's training going?

648
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:40,924
Well, the physical
stuff is great.

649
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,026
Academics suck.

650
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,027
Job as what?

651
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:45,395
He's a tattoo artist.

652
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,764
Of course he is.

653
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,233
Do you think Ian will get
into west point?

654
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,502
Well, competition's tough,
but we have to try.

655
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:54,070
Now, can you really
call them artists

656
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:55,505
when all they're really doing

657
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:58,241
is putting ink in
somebody's arm?

658
00:25:58,275 --> 00:25:59,342
He's very good at what he does.

659
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:00,943
Sure.
Do you want Ian

660
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,046
to get in?
I don't know.

661
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,247
I mean, you know,
I don't want him

662
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,249
just to struggle keeping up

663
00:26:06,284 --> 00:26:08,619
and then have to enlist.

664
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:12,790
You know what? I'm thinking
about getting a tattoo of you.

665
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:15,193
You think Jody would
do that for me?

666
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:17,629
Maybe Ian will surprise you.

667
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:21,432
I hope so.

668
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:24,602
Awesome.

669
00:26:26,104 --> 00:26:27,071
All yours.

670
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:29,106
Yes, it is.

671
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:41,050
I'm going to take a shower
before <i>days of our lives</i> starts.

672
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:42,986
There's a lot of shit in here.

673
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,654
Well, I can't always
make it to the toilet.

674
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,926
I'm kidding, Frank.

675
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,407
Uh, yeah, you just paged me.

676
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:08,410
Good afternoon, is
this patient 13437917?

677
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:11,113
Yes-- Well, her husband.

678
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,115
There was a bus crash
on Interstate 494.

679
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,152
We've been informed
there may be a heart available.

680
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:19,856
Um, she, she doesn't
need it anymore.

681
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,091
What?

682
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,359
She passed last night.

683
00:27:23,394 --> 00:27:25,261
Please accept our condolences.

684
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:27,196
She was the love of my life.

685
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,097
I don't know
how I'm going to survive.

686
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:32,033
We're so sorry an organ
didn't become available in time.

687
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,035
Thank you.

688
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,780
You spelled Kevin wrong.

689
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:47,482
Ha-ha, very funny.

690
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,118
Hey, babe,

691
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:52,786
what you need me to sign?
Loan forms.

692
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:54,188
I need you to help
fill them out first.

693
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:55,355
They're like 20 pages long.

694
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:57,457
Kev, if you own the bar,

695
00:27:57,492 --> 00:27:58,859
I'm never gonna see you anymore.

696
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:00,027
That's not true.

697
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:01,328
Sure, it is.

698
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:03,296
Business owners always
work long hours.

699
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,531
Look at the wangs.

700
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,166
Chicken wing wangs?
Yeah.

701
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,002
Those kids are there all day.

702
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:09,904
It's a, it's a full-time job
for the entire family.

703
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,139
My hours won't change, baby.

704
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:12,240
I practically run
this place now.

705
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,509
Excuse me, who runs this joint?

706
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:16,045
Oh, what, you think you do?

707
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,314
I make the schedule.
That's because I let you.

708
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:19,581
It's called delegating.

709
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,717
V, what's your mom's
maiden name?

710
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:23,185
How we gonna swing this, Kev?

711
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:24,487
The banks want 20% down.

712
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:27,756
30, but if I make
an extra $1,000 a week,

713
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,725
I'll have enough in six months.
A thousand?

714
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,662
You never make more than a
couple hundred a night. I know.

715
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:35,165
That's why I'm planning to do
special events every week.

716
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,600
What kind of special events?
Disco nights,

717
00:28:36,634 --> 00:28:39,069
singles mixers,
throwing a beach party

718
00:28:39,104 --> 00:28:40,403
tomorrow to kick things off.

719
00:28:40,438 --> 00:28:41,671
A what?

720
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:44,374
Sand, tropical drinks,
sun and fun, baby.

721
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:47,077
Shit's cool, huh?

722
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:50,246
Yeah, really cool.

723
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,248
Seriously?

724
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:58,886
What are you doing?

725
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:00,121
Lost Karen's ring.

726
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,889
Oh, man, that sucks.

727
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:03,391
Used all my savings to buy it.

728
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:06,528
When I lose something, I
like to say a little prayer.

729
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:08,196
Something's lost
and cannot be found.

730
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:10,765
Please, St. Anthony,
look around.

731
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,801
Okay.

732
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,269
You seen Karen?

733
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,438
I don't have a prayer for that.

734
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:23,979
I have something to tell you.

735
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:27,283
What, finally going to let me
plow the back fields?

736
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:28,819
You already are.

737
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:30,654
Oh, shit, sorry, um...

738
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:31,889
It's okay,

739
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:33,123
I like it.

740
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:35,226
Oh.

741
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,161
So what'd you want to tell me?

742
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:39,097
We can't have sex anymore.

743
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:40,632
What?

744
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:44,335
I'm pretty sure that
Jody's going to propose.

745
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:46,436
Is, is that a good thing?

746
00:29:46,471 --> 00:29:47,738
It's a great thing.

747
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:49,773
Oh.

748
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:54,611
Okay.

749
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:58,348
Another boilermaker, Kev.

750
00:29:58,383 --> 00:29:59,650
Hey, Frank, you ever
take out a loan?

751
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:01,252
Don't like the paper trail.

752
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:02,586
Always pay cash.

753
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:03,988
Okay, I'll just pull 150 grand

754
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:05,923
out of my pocket
and pay for the bar myself.

755
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:10,361
You're just like everyone else,
Kev, you know that?

756
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:12,663
Always looking for a handout.

757
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:13,831
Fuck you, Frank.

758
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:15,432
Can I borrow some money?

759
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,934
Can I borrow your car?

760
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:19,504
Can I borrow your organ?

761
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:21,372
What the fuck are you talking about?
You know what's wrong

762
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:23,509
with the organ
transplant system?

763
00:30:23,543 --> 00:30:24,944
No, and I don't care,

764
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:26,045
but I doubt that'll stop you.

765
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,112
If you're waiting

766
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:29,315
for a new organ, you are

767
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,786
just interfering
with God's plan.

768
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,555
What, so God's plan is,
some little kid dies

769
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,223
of kidney failure because
he didn't get a transplant?

770
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:37,824
Why do you argue with him?

771
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:39,659
I can't-- I don't know--
I can't help myself.

772
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:42,562
God's plan is that you take

773
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:45,531
what we are given
and don't complain.

774
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:48,901
No one is satisfied
with what they have anymore.

775
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:51,203
Always trying
to get something better.

776
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:54,139
"I don't like my heart;
I think I'll get on a list,

777
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,007
get a new one, upgrade."

778
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:57,342
You talking about butterface?

779
00:30:57,376 --> 00:31:00,545
If you've got a bum heart,
that's your lot in life.

780
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,481
Don't take someone else's.

781
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:04,917
It's not yours.

782
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:05,985
She got along

783
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:09,354
just fine with her heart
all these years.

784
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,157
Why's she got to be greedy

785
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:12,558
and want another one?

786
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:13,726
Could be worse.

787
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,597
She could be like those people
born without a heart.

788
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:19,099
You mean dead people?

789
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:20,767
Worked with a guy from
Michigan-- Only spoke English.

790
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:23,671
Got a liver transplant
from a Mexican.

791
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:25,840
Suddenly speaks
perfect Spanish.

792
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:28,577
And just 'cause she's
on some stupid list,

793
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:32,381
how come she's
the next one in line?

794
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:35,250
Maybe there's someone needier

795
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:38,788
or more deserving,
like a black woman.

796
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:43,725
Those people have gotten
a bum rap in our society,

797
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,194
being two minorities and all.

798
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:47,529
I should call V
and tell her that.

799
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:50,031
From now on, only black ladies

800
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:51,366
should get all the
organ transplants.

801
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,568
Finally give them first crack

802
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:56,004
at something in this lifetime.

803
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:08,149
I saw that.

804
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:10,152
I put more money in
here than anyone, okay,

805
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:12,888
- so zip it.
- Thought we weren't supposed to touch

806
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:14,123
the squirrel fund

807
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:15,490
till Thanksgiving?
We're not,

808
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:17,092
but I have to borrow 50 bucks

809
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:18,993
so that I can return
all the purse money I found.

810
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:21,129
We give stuff back
when we find it?

811
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:22,830
No.
What?

812
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:24,598
Finders keepers,
losers weepers.

813
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:26,100
Don't be telling him that.
It's the Gallagher credo.

814
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:28,402
Find something,
it's your lucky day

815
00:32:28,436 --> 00:32:30,170
and somebody else's shitty day.

816
00:32:30,205 --> 00:32:32,239
Tomorrow it's going
to be the opposite.

817
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:34,174
It's the balance of nature.

818
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,441
What are you doing here?
Hey.

819
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:36,776
Came to get my good suit.

820
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,010
Your good suit?

821
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:39,412
I'm getting married today.

822
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:40,847
You're already married.

823
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,115
Technicality.

824
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:44,785
Remember, no good deed
goes unpunished.

825
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:46,654
Every man for himself.

826
00:32:46,688 --> 00:32:48,422
Don't listen to him, okay?

827
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:50,658
We give stuff back.
I did the wrong thing

828
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:52,860
and now I'm gonna go do
the right thing.

829
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:04,372
Hey.

830
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:05,373
What you doing?

831
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:06,607
I got to run an errand

832
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:07,841
up in Glencoe.

833
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:09,276
Well, I have a few minutes free.

834
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,711
You want to take a detour
and meet me?

835
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,048
I can't, sorry.

836
00:33:15,082 --> 00:33:16,816
I wish I could.

837
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,685
No, it's okay,
I just thought I'd try. Bye.

838
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,887
Bye.

839
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,859
What in the hell, Kev?

840
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:29,361
Oh, shit, baby, I'm sorry,
I was trying not to wake you.

841
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:31,063
What are you doing

842
00:33:31,098 --> 00:33:32,731
up so early?
Getting ready for the beach party

843
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:34,467
at the alibi room.

844
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:35,668
You're really going to do this?

845
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:37,370
Oh, yeah, but I was thinking,

846
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:38,805
you know, it's going
to take a little while

847
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,406
for my special events
nights to kick in

848
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:41,408
and start making money.

849
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:43,343
That's probably true.

850
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:46,013
So let's take a cash advance
out on the capital one card.

851
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,516
What? I know we're saving it for
an emergency, but I called.

852
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,717
They'll give us $5,000.

853
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:51,186
Kev.
Or I can go to Vinnie.

854
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,821
You know, he came in
late last night,

855
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:54,689
said he'd loan me enough
for the down payment.

856
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:57,192
Even offered to drop his
interest rate to 40%.

857
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:59,494
Vinnie "The Shiv" Vinnie,
who cut that guy's head off?

858
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:00,995
He was never indicted.
Doesn't mean it didn't happen.

859
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,397
We could go to your mom.

860
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,598
She hasn't touched
the equity on her house.

861
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:04,866
It's a horrible idea.

862
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,167
What is?
Buying the bar.

863
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:08,068
You're not doing it.
I thought you said

864
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:10,270
it was a good idea.
I love you,

865
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:12,339
I do, but you'd be
terrible at it.

866
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:14,174
You're better at doing
one thing at a time.

867
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,775
Owning a bar is
like a juggling act.

868
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:18,277
You don't have the head
for that kind of thing.

869
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:19,612
Are you calling me dumb?

870
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:20,679
No.

871
00:34:20,714 --> 00:34:22,047
Well, it sounds like you are.

872
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:23,248
Maybe I'm just too dumb
to understand.

873
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:24,250
I'm not calling you dumb.

874
00:34:24,284 --> 00:34:25,251
You applied it.

875
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:26,686
"Implied."

876
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,887
I know.

877
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:29,055
I said it on purpose

878
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:30,723
to show you how dumb I am.

879
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:32,358
You're going to ruin our
credit, my mother's credit.

880
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:33,893
You know, maybe you could
just let me try it

881
00:34:33,928 --> 00:34:35,895
before you get
all negative on me.

882
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,364
Kev, be reasonable.

883
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:39,265
I got to go to the bar
and blow up my beach balls.

884
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,307
Hey, Dots, it's me.

885
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:49,910
You ready?

886
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:52,078
Dottie, why aren't you dressed?

887
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:53,580
This is our big day.

888
00:34:53,614 --> 00:34:54,948
Chop-chop, city
hall awaits.

889
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:57,050
I was watching the news.

890
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:59,653
There was an accident
on I-494 yesterday.

891
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:01,087
Oh.

892
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:02,722
Why don't you tell me about it

893
00:35:02,756 --> 00:35:04,958
on the bus ride
down to city hall?

894
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:06,793
One of the victims had
a B-positive heart.

895
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:09,896
A boy from Clark County got it.

896
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,230
He's a lucky guy.

897
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:12,932
And so am I.

898
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:15,334
♪ Because we're going
to the chapel ♪

899
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:18,404
♪ and we're gonna
get married... ♪

900
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:20,239
That was the heart I needed.

901
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:23,676
Oh, I'm sure there's another one
just around the corner.

902
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,577
Come on, we should
try to beat the rush

903
00:35:25,612 --> 00:35:27,279
of Mexicans getting married.

904
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:29,815
My doctor said
b-positive hearts are rare.

905
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:31,416
Huh?

906
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,485
Maybe come along
once every six months.

907
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,320
I looked it up online.

908
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:37,622
No, no, lots of people
are organ donors.

909
00:35:37,656 --> 00:35:39,257
I won't last
another six months.

910
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:42,628
You got to keep
a positive outlook, Dottie.

911
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:46,099
I'm ready to go now, Frank.

912
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:47,601
Take me to the bedroom.

913
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:49,303
The... oh.

914
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:52,306
No. No, no, no, no,
I can't do that.

915
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:54,776
I'm halfway there as it is.

916
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,545
We're not married.

917
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,380
Don't do this, Frank.

918
00:35:58,414 --> 00:36:00,282
I'm a very religious man.

919
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:02,384
I know
that you've been playing me.

920
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:04,653
What?
It's okay.

921
00:36:04,688 --> 00:36:08,457
I've enjoyed our time together.

922
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:12,494
So have I.

923
00:36:12,528 --> 00:36:14,529
You took care of me

924
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:17,065
and gave me companionship
in my final weeks.

925
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:22,638
But my house is going to
the national coalition of nuns.

926
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:25,842
And my money's gonna go
to my daughter.

927
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:28,345
You said
she wasn't speaking to you.

928
00:36:28,379 --> 00:36:31,248
She doesn't...
But it's my fault.

929
00:36:31,283 --> 00:36:33,250
I wasn't a good mother.

930
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:36,187
The booze, and I yelled.

931
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:38,589
And I hit her.

932
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:41,859
It's gotta go to her, Frank.

933
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:47,699
I should be getting
home to my kids.

934
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,067
I'll give you two grand.

935
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:50,835
What?

936
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:53,238
Cash. It's in the freezer.

937
00:36:58,711 --> 00:36:59,711
Make it three?

938
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:01,980
Two and the flat screen.

939
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:08,053
If you care about me,
you'll do this for me, Frank.

940
00:37:18,131 --> 00:37:20,967
I want to leave the
lights on when we do it.

941
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,435
And eyes open.

942
00:37:31,978 --> 00:37:36,315
You feel so good. Here it comes,
here it comes, here it comes.

943
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:48,125

Hey. What's up?

00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:45,950
I feel really bad
somebody swiped your money.

955
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,285
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I thought I'd give you...

956
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,787
Oh, please, like I
don't know you took it.

957
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:52,624
What? No. Come on, you stole
my goddamn money. Admit it.

958
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:55,461
I did not.
Of course you did.

959
00:38:55,495 --> 00:38:56,996
You're a skanky, ghetto
trash, hood girl.

960
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,797
Oh, what, like
you're all high and mighty

961
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:00,999
'cause you moved north,
and you have a Louis Vuitton?

962
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,334
Which you fucking swiped.

963
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:04,669
Which you were stupid enough
to leave on the L.

964
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,972
Bitch.
Oh, you're the bitch.

965
00:39:07,006 --> 00:39:09,908
Okay? I came here to be nice,
but forget it now.

966
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:11,509
Fuck you.
Oh, eat me.

967
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:12,910
Whore.
Slut.

968
00:39:12,945 --> 00:39:14,678
Asshole.
Cunt.

969
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:15,913
Off to steal
another fucking purse?

970
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:18,315
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

971
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,118
Fuck you! Fuck!

972
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:41,506
Hey, still free to get together?

973
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,241
Fi, you up here?

974
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:45,410
You want to go
to the alibi with me,

975
00:39:45,444 --> 00:39:47,044
spend some money
and support Kev?

976
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,847
She went to give the purse woman

977
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,481
her money back.

978
00:39:53,552 --> 00:39:55,586
He's okay.
Not dead.

979
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,222
Debs, what gives
with this obsession about death?

980
00:39:58,256 --> 00:40:00,958
Nothing.

981
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:03,126
Come on, it's me.

982
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:09,366
Well, until Harry, I had no
idea people I knew could die.

983
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,234
Honey, he was old.

984
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:14,371
Yeah, but that means my
family's gonna die, too.

985
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:16,139
Yeah, in, like, 80 years.

986
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,808
And then I'll be all alone.

987
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:19,376
What?

988
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:21,378
Men die first.
Lip, Ian, Carl, Liam.

989
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,147
Then Fiona because she's older.

990
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:26,650
That just leaves
me all by myself.

991
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:28,752
Debs, there are way
too many things in life

992
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:30,421
you're gonna have
to worry about.

993
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:32,556
Don't stress
about this right now.

994
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,727
Yeah, but I can't
shut off my brain.

995
00:40:36,762 --> 00:40:39,330
Think about nice things.

996
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:42,133
Flowers, ice cream, puppies.

997
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,068
Can you do that?

998
00:40:44,102 --> 00:40:46,671
I guess so.

999
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:49,473
What are you thinking about now?

1000
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:50,941
A puppy...

1001
00:40:50,975 --> 00:40:52,910
Getting hit by a car.

1002
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:55,979
Well, that's a start.

1003
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:58,381
Come here.

1004
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:02,986
Why'd you want to meet here?

1005
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,190
You said I should have made
a move on you in high school.

1006
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:08,025
You should have.

1007
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,961
Here we are.

1008
00:41:09,995 --> 00:41:13,498
You want to pretend like
we're back in high school?

1009
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:15,967
We don't really have
to pretend.

1010
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,835
What do you mean?

1011
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,604
In some time space continuum,
we still are in high school.

1012
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,275
Like in a parallel universe?

1013
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:25,643
What about your wife?

1014
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:27,478
I didn't have a wife
in high school.

1015
00:41:33,017 --> 00:41:34,484
Seriously?

1016
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:38,822
Ew!

1017
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:41,792
Z. Zebra.

1018
00:41:41,826 --> 00:41:45,163
Super. Which one is the Zebra?

1019
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,668
Okay, you know what?
What?

1020
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:51,036
Which one is the Zebra?

1021
00:41:54,374 --> 00:41:55,809
Good job!

1022
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:57,978
Ee, ee, ee.

1023
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:03,517
Two virgin piña coladas.

1024
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:05,486
Thank you, Kate.
Hey, baby.

1025
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,755
Lenny, Lenny, what
the fuck, man?

1026
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:11,159
This isn't a litter box.

1027
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:14,828
Don't say a fucking word.

1028
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:16,697
I didn't say anything.
You were thinking it.

1029
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,199
I was not.

1030
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:20,034
What you said this morning
was really mean. I know.

1031
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:21,602
I'm sorry. That's why
I came, to show you support.

1032
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:23,838
Oh, yeah? Well, the beach
party's a disaster.

1033
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:26,340
The next one's gonna be better.

1034
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:28,176
And don't be chopping off
my balls like that again.

1035
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,078
I got nothing but love
for your balls.

1036
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:33,948
V, I really want
to buy this bar.

1037
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:36,417
Fine.

1038
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:39,187
If the time comes
where Stan needs to sell,

1039
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:42,291
we'll try and figure something
out, but no Vinnie The Shiv.

1040
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:44,026
Jesus Christ. Squelch
my dreams much?

1041
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:54,404
Nice. Where'd you
steal that one from, Frank?

1042
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,439
Booze.

1043
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,908
Have you been crying?

1044
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:02,712
Makers.
How many shots?

1045
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,381
Bottle it is.

1046
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,018
You look like
you've seen a ghost, Frank.

1047
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,523
Ring.

1048
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:18,562
Aw, Frank, the prayer worked.

1049
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,764
Is that my ring?

1050
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:25,269
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1051
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,339
You okay, daddy?

1052
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,743
I just looked death
in the face, debs.

1053
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,779
It wasn't pretty.

1054
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:38,149
I know what you mean.

1055
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:40,484
