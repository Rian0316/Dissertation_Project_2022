你剛剛承認犯了一項重罪你知道吧
You do realize you just confessed to a felony.

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,937
就我們倆  空口無憑
It's your word against mine.

5
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:09,927
如果那盤帶子沒用  還有什么意義
If that tape is useless, what's the point?

6
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:11,518
-是我干的  -關掉
- It was me. - Turn that off!

7
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:13,854
絕對不能告訴任何人
You cannot tell anyone.

11
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,075
今天有那么一會兒  查克沒有討厭我
For 10 minutes today, Chuck didn't hate me.

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,555
別以為我會忘記今天在這發生的事
Don't think I'll ever forget what happened here today.

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,513
你會付出代價的
And you will pay.

謝謝  先生
Thank you, sir.

20
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,610
這些牌為什么有孔
Why do the cards have holes in them?

21
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,730
這些是賭場淘汰的舊牌
They're, uh -- These are used cards from the casino.

22
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,830
賭場要是想把一副牌換掉
Once the casino pulls a deck of cards out of action,

23
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,320
會在牌上打孔  再把牌賣給公眾
they drill a hole through them and sell 'em to the public.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,540
很便宜  一兩塊
Just a buck or 2.

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
瞧瞧啊
Look at that.

26
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,740
我想這樣是防止人出老千
I suppose that's to prevent people from cheating with them.

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,770
是啊
Yeah.

28
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,540
也算是不錯的紀念品
Makes for a good souvenir.

Getting dark.

32
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,190
不好意思  好像該關燈了
I hate to say it, but I think it might be time to kill the lights.

33
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,750
是的  先生  沒問題
Oh, yes, sir. Of course.

34
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,540
真不用我給你泡杯茶嗎
You sure I can't make you a cup of tea?

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,870
不用了  先生  謝謝
I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

Hey, you take care of that battery?

41
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,940
解決了  最后還是沒電了
Oh, yeah. It finally shit the bed,

42
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,860
但我們幾小時之前換掉了
but we swapped it out a couple hours ago.

43
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,740
好  現在怎么樣
Okay. How'd it go?

44
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,870
沒問題
No problem.

45
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,070
-有人看見你嗎  -沒有  一個人都沒有
- Anyone see you? - Nah. Dead over there.

快進來

55
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,240
我是弗朗西斯卡·莉蒂
I'm Francesca Liddy.

56
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,660
我是來面試的
I'm here for the interview.

57
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,170
吉米·麥吉爾
Jimmy McGill.

58
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,140
是你來早了  還是我遲到了
Are you, uh, running early, or am I running late?

59
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,870
抱歉  是我來早了
No, sorry. I'm a little early.

60
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,860
沒關系
It's not a problem.

61
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,310
早點總沒錯
Never bad to be early...

62
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,180
不過死亡或交稅什么的另當別論
except in death and taxes and...some other things.

63
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,780
我能問個問題嗎
Hey, can I ask you a question?

64
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,830
好
Sure.

65
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,050
你覺得這畫得直嗎
Does that look straight to you?

66
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,770
我覺得那邊
I think there -- that -- that side --

67
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,140
有點彎
I think you're a little crooked --

68
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,220
M的下面
the bottom of the "M" there.

69
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,160
是有點彎
Yeah. A little crooked.

70
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,630
你在車管部做了七年之后辭職了
So, you're coming off of seven years at the MVD?

71
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,660
是的
I am, yeah.

72
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,750
問題是  為什么新墨西哥州
Here's a question -- how come New Mexico

73
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,480
不像其他州一樣管它叫車管所呢
doesn't call it the DMV like every other state?

74
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,600
這個問題問得好
Well, that's a great question.

75
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,550
就像在亞利桑那州
Just like in Arizona,

76
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,950
車輛管理部分屬交通運輸部  是一個部門
the Motor Vehicles Division is part of the DOT, a division,

77
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,220
然而其他州大多都是車管所
whereas, in most other states, the DMV,

78
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,710
也就是車輛管理所  自成一體  所以
or Department of Motor Vehicles is its own entity, so...

79
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,860
不知道這個回答你滿不滿意
I don't know if that answers the question,

80
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,880
反正政府就這么叫的
except to say that's the government for you.

81
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,900
你說得對
You got that right.

82
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,900
我才不會叫它車管部呢
Well, I, for one, am not calling it the MVD --

83
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,710
我會一直叫它車管所
DMV all the way.

84
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,170
你覺得在那里工作  最大的收獲是什么
What do you think you learned the most working there?

85
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,500
耐心  交際手腕
Patience, diplomacy.

86
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,950
在那兒會碰到各種各樣的人
you meet a-all sorts of people down there,

87
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,320
大多數都很不錯  非常友善
a-and most are really great, really friendly,

88
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,570
但你會遇到一些愛挑事的人
but you encounter some who are upset, belligerent.

89
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,850
那老年人呢
What about old folks?

90
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,150
你遇到過很多嗎
Uh, you get your fair share of them?

91
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,310
有好多上了年紀的司機
Oh, lots of elderly drivers.

92
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,950
七十五歲之后  他們得再考一次駕照
After 75, they need to take their test again,

93
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,290
要是沒通過
so if they don't pass,

94
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,290
你就得給他們解釋
you have to explain to them

95
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,810
為什么不能幫他們更新駕照
why their license isn't being renewed,

96
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,080
對他們來說挺難接受的
which is hard for them.

97
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,750
那你會怎么說
What do you say then?

98
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,900
你吼過他們嗎
Do you ever... yell at them?

99
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,120
那些老不死的
I mean, geezers, right?

100
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,450
你怎么可能不吼呢
How can you not?

101
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,850
我從來沒有
No, I would never.

102
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,850
沒有
No.

103
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,660
你也不應該  這問題是個陷阱
Nor should you. That was a trick question.

104
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,110
你通過了  很棒
You passed with flying colors -- very good.

105
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,070
好
Okay.

106
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,210
吉米和我的需求差異很大
Well, then, so, Jimmy and I have very different needs.

107
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,430
他的業務大多是幫老年人立遺囑
His practice is mostly wills for senior citizens,

108
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,130
我現在只專心應付一位委托人
while I'm focused on a single client at the moment,

109
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,430
梅薩維德銀行  因為他們的規章制度
Mesa Verde, with banking regulations

110
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,010
所以有成噸的文書工作
that generate a ton of paperwork,

111
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,940
我想找一個
so I'm looking for someone

112
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,140
有條理又注重細節的人
with an eye for organization and detail.

113
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,620
車管所很看重這一點
Well, DMV's great for that --

114
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,580
那些駕照可是有上千處細節
tons of detail in those driver's licenses.

115
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,610
我們確實每天見到上百張面孔
We did see hundreds of people every day,

116
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,020
你可不想把他們的表格弄錯
and you'd never want to let a mistake slip through on their forms.

117
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,060
那樣會引起一大堆問題
You'd just have a horrible cascade of problems.

118
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,440
聽上去很有挑戰性
Sounds challenging.

119
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,520
為什么選擇律所
So, why the law?

120
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,410
為什么離開車管所  車管部
I mean, why leave the DMV -- or MVD?

121
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,170
我覺得
I have to imagine

122
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,420
你們的待遇一定很不錯吧
you'll be giving up a good benefits package.

123
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,230
完備的醫保和退休計劃  但...
Good healthcare and retirement plans, but...

124
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,860
政府工作總牽扯到官僚主義
there's a bureaucracy to government work

125
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,800
最終讓我很沮喪
that ultimately became too frustrating.

126
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,400
用你們的話說就是繁文縟節太多
I guess what you'd call it -- too much red tape.

127
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,160
我想去一個能成就一番事業的地方
I just want to be somewhere I can make a difference.

128
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,520
那就是我們  我們想干出一番事業
Well, that's us. We're all about making a difference.

129
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,590
你的簡歷上還寫到你熟練使用
And I see here both Word and Excel --

130
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,760
-文字和表格辦公軟件  -沒錯
- you're comfortable with? - Absolutely.

131
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,450
辦公文件  天啊
Excel and Word? Wow.

132
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,330
你說到老年人時就已經打動我了
Well, you had me at old people.

133
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,680
我有個問題  你能今天就來上班嗎
Hey, here's a question -- can you start today?

134
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,470
-我...  -那個...
- I, uh... - Can --

135
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,030
可以
Yes?

136
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,660
-太棒了  -你能...
- Fantastic. - Now, can you --

137
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,290
你能等我們商量下嗎  弗朗西斯卡
Can you just give us a second, Francesca?

138
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,930
當然
Absolutely. I...

139
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,010
沒問題
Of course.

140
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,180
謝謝
Thank you.

141
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,790
你在做什么
What are you doing?

142
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,110
我喜歡她
What? I like her.

143
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,310
"你能今天就來上班嗎"
"Can you start today?"

144
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,910
你不覺得我們應該先看看別的簡歷嗎
Don't you think we should see some more résumés --

145
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,200
多看幾份
like, a lot more?

146
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,180
她是第一個面試的
She is our first interview.

147
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,940
我們還沒檢查她的推薦信
We haven't even checked her references.

148
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,090
我們這就查
So we'll check 'em.

149
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,280
金  你一直在尋找一位律師助理
Kim, you've been takin' forever searching for a paralegal.

150
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,160
我們需要幫手
We need help here.

151
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,190
我還沒找到合適的
I haven't found the right fit.

152
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,510
因為你總苛求完美
Yeah, 'cause you're searching for perfection,

153
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,820
完美可是尋找夠格人選的頭號障礙
and perfection is the enemy of perfectly adequate.

154
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,350
你的標準就是夠格嗎
Oh, so that's the bar here -- adequate?

155
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,740
她不僅夠格  她在車管所工作過
She's more than adequate! She worked at the DMV.

156
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,680
那可是不折不扣的地獄
That's like the fifth circle of Hell.

157
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,480
她足以勝任了
Look, she's overqualified.

158
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,740
如果實在不行  我們就開除她
I-If it doesn't work out, we can fire her.

159
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,760
沒什么大不了的
It's no big deal.

160
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,930
你不覺得有法律實踐經驗的人
Don't you think someone with some actual legal experience

161
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,710
會更合適嗎
would be better?

162
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,020
電視上該放我的廣告了  還有...
Look, I've got a commercial airing in...

163
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,050
十一分鐘
11 minutes,

164
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,870
電話會沒完沒了響個不停
so the phones are gonna be ringin' off the hook

165
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,680
我需要幫助
and I need help.

166
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,790
我們能先試用一下她嗎
Can we give her a test run, please?

167
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,550
我有不錯的預感
I got a good feeling about this.

168
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,710
拜托了  金
Come on, Kim.

169
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,350
讓這些老年人打電話
Now, getting these oldsters to call --

170
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,150
就已經成功了一半
that's half the battle,

171
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,420
他們需要聽到友好的聲音
so they need to hear a friendly voice.

172
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,890
友好  沒問題
Friendly? Absolutely.

173
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,510
聲音洪亮  發音清晰
Speak loudly and clearly,

174
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,010
但也別太過頭了
but, uh, be careful with the loud and clear,

175
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,810
可能會讓人誤解為生氣
'cause it can come off as angry.

176
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,550
親民點
Be folksy.

177
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,290
聲音中帶點陽光
Put a little sunshine in your voice.

178
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,340
-明白  -好
- Got it. - Okay.

179
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,510
你想喝咖啡或是水嗎
You need coffee or water?

180
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,200
抓緊時間去廁所...
You need to hit the head before things --

181
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,980
開始了
Oh, there it goes.

182
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,220
吉米·麥吉爾辦公室  有什么能幫您的
Offices of Jimmy McGill. How may I help you?

不好意思
Sorry about that.

188
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,910
我能為您做點什么
What can I do for you?

189
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,810
沒錯
Uh, that's right.

190
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,850
廣告上的那個吉米·麥吉爾
Jimmy McGill from the commercial.

191
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,140
您想過來咨詢一下嗎
Would you look to come in for a consultation?

192
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,810
親民  親民一點
Folksy -- be folksy.

193
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,910
我是聽到小狗的叫聲了嗎
Say, is that a dog I'm hearing?

194
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,030
真的
It is?

195
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,070
它叫什么名字
Aww, what's her name?

196
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,090
餅干桶餐館
Yeah, Cracker Barrel.

197
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,730
提到餅干桶餐館總會有幫助
It always helps to mention Cracker Barrel.

198
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,820
您讓瑪格麗特在屋里玩是個好主意
Well, I think it's great you let Margaret play inside.

199
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,280
外面可熱了
It's a hot one out there.

200
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,170
我在想一會兒去餅干桶餐館呢
I was thinking of going over to Cracker Barrel

201
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,520
他們那兒的空調特別棒
because they've got such great air-conditioning.

202
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,370
他們家的餅干也不錯
Well, yes, I love their biscuits, too.

203
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,660
太棒了
Well, that's wonderful.

204
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,420
遺囑確實很重要
Yes, I think a will is really important.

205
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,620
您想什么時候過來和麥吉爾先生見面
When would you like to come in and meet Mr. McGill?

206
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,360
"吉米"  是吉米
"Jimmy"! Jimmy.

207
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,670
永遠都是吉米
Always Jimmy.

208

220
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,620
吉米現在很忙  如果您想...
Jimmy is busy at the moment, but if you'd like --

221
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,570
聽起來您在戶外
Uh, you sound like you're outdoors.

222
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,870
您在陰涼處嗎
Are you staying out of the sun?

223
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,360
今天很熱
It's a hot one today.

224
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,210
抱歉  吉米現在無法接聽您的電話
I'm sorry, but Jimmy is unavailable at the moment.

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,370
如果你想留個口信  厄門紹特先生嗎
If you'd like to leave a message, Mr... Ehrmantraut?

226
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,420
和鮭魚同音的那個嗎
"Trout," like the fish?

227
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,640
我聽說餅干桶餐館里的空調很好...
Uh, I hear Cracker Barrel has excellent air--

228
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,540
這位客戶真的對餅干桶餐館不感興趣
This one really don't want to talk about Cracker Barrel.

229
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,220
好  把電話轉給我
Yeah, patch that one through.

230
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,700
麥吉爾先生將接聽您的電話
Mr. McGill will take your call.

231
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,750
你的新助理真的很煩人
Your new assistant's a real pip.

232
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,450
謝謝你在她上班第一天就粉碎了她的積極性
Yeah, thanks for crushing her spirit on the first day.

233
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,190
謝謝  先生  祝你一路順風
Thank you, sir. You drive safe.

234
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,910

You the only one on this line?

235
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,040

You're gonna go inside, buy a cup of coffee, a meal --

240
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,690
大概十到十五分鐘后

我需要你盯著那個背包

Oh, don't worry.

302
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,170
如果真是掉進去了  我會...
If it's in here, I'll -- Ah.

303
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,880
在這兒呢
There it is.

304
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,040
需要我為您擦干凈嗎
May I clean this for you?

305
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,230
我們有酒精濕巾
We have alcohol wipes.

306
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,650
不用了  它掉進過更臟的地方
Oh, nah, it's been in worse places.

307
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,690
謝謝
Thank you.

308
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,050
真的太謝謝你了
That was very nice of you.

309
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,700
小事  樂意效勞
No problem. It's my pleasure.

310
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,430
-還有什么需要幫忙的嗎  -沒有了
- Is there anything else I can do for you? - Uh, no.

311
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,270
謝謝
Thanks.

312
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,650
保重
You take care.

313
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,680
再說一遍
Tell me again.

314
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,090
老天  你要我用幾種不同的方式來說
Jesus. How many different ways you want me to say it?

315
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,740
告訴我你看到了什么
Just tell me what you saw.

316
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,300
就像你說的  他走進來
He came in, like you said he would.

317
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,000
點了套餐三  外加炸土豆和咖啡
He ordered the number three with potatoes and coffee,

318
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,450
還多要了莎莎醬
went bold with the extra salsa,

319
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,780
然后他從左前口袋掏出現金結了賬
and he paid cash out of his left front pocket.

320
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,460
拿著他的托盤
Uh, took his tray of food,

321
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,090
坐在了餐廳東邊的座位上
sat in a booth on the east side of the restaurant,

322
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,800
把背包放在地上
and put the knapsack on the floor.

323
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,050
地上哪兒
Where on the floor?

324
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,520
座位下方  夾在兩條腿之間
Under his seat, between his legs.

325
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,510
沒人碰過
Nobody touched it.

326
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,370
他也沒跟任何人說過話
He didn't talk to anybody.

327
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,430
他甚至沒正眼瞧過別人
He didn't even look at anybody.

328
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,480
頂多五分鐘就吃完了
Finished his meal in five minutes, tops,

329
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,980
然后就走了  什么都沒留下
and skedaddled -- didn't leave anything behind.

330
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,450
你確定嗎
And you're sure of that?

331
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,110
我還檢查了垃圾桶
I literally checked the trash can.

332
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,410
除了垃圾  里面啥都沒有
There was nothing in there but trash.

333
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,580
下一步我們怎么做
So...what's our next move, huh?

334
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,750
要跟蹤這個人嗎
Are we gonna follow this guy?

335
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,880
因為你有這個007特工用的東西
'Cause you -- you got some real James Bond stuff in here.

336
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,320
這車里不會有彈射座椅吧
This car doesn't have an ejector seat, does it?

337
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,020
今天就這樣吧
I think we're done for today.

338
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,950
-就完事了  -完事了
- That's it? - That's it.

339
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,000
我可是取消了早上的日程
I mean, I cleared my morning.

340
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,140
我們難道不...
What -- we're not gonna do, like,

341
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,340
尾隨他到下一個地點嗎
tail him to a new location?

342
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,230
我們至少得盯牢他吧...
Or, I mean, we got to sit on him, at least. I --

343
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,050
抱歉耽誤了你的時間
Thanks for your time.

344
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,170
誰是你堅實的后盾
Hey, who's got your back, huh?

345
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,870
就是我
Me -- that's who.

346
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,020
這話我會記著
I'll keep that in mind.

347
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:22,100
{\an8}均為車型和顏色

348
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,740
{\an8}目標

349
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,590
金  和亞利桑那州監管員的電話會議
Oh, Kim, the conference call with the Arizona regulator

350
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,730
得改期了
needs to be rescheduled.

351
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,760
周四可以嗎
Thursday okay?

352
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,720
好  沒問題
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

353
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,790
好的
Okay.

354
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,360
弗朗西斯卡  我們還有那種
Francesca, have we got any more

355
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,430
低熱量黃油曲奇餅干嗎
of those dietetic butter cookies?

356
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,240
我找找
I can check.

357
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,270
謝謝
Thanks.

358
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,660
歡迎各位
Welcome, folks!

359
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,160
歐尼  什么事
Hey, Ernie. What's up?

360
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,220
你不能進來嗎
Can't you just come inside?

361
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,830
抱歉
Sorry.

362
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,750
謝了
Thanks.

363
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,920
什么事
What are we doing out here?

364
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,710
我不想給你打電話
I didn't want to call you

365
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,750
因為這樣會留下通話記錄
because then it would leave a phone record.

366
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,000
我本來想進去的
I was gonna come in,

367
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,160
但我轉念一想  或許吉米不該見到我
but then I thought maybe Jimmy shouldn't see me.

368
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,890
所以...
So...

369
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,240
但你打給我了
But you just called me.

370
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,380
可能我早就搞砸了
Guess I screwed up already.

371
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,660
歐尼  搞砸什么
Ernie, screwed what up?

372
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,230
你為什么不想見吉米
Why don't you want to see Jimmy?

373
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,260
是因為...
Well, it's just...

374
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,530
我不知道怎么開頭
I'm not sure how to start.

375
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,500
實話跟我說就行
You can start by just telling me.

376
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,720
事情是這樣的
Here's the thing.

377
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,210
我有一些情報
I have some information,

378
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,900
但我不想惹上麻煩
but I don't want to get in trouble.

379
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,780
和吉米的麻煩
Trouble with Jimmy?

380
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,330
不  是哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
No. With HHM.

381
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,730
我受保密協議的限制  是吧
I think I'm bound by confidentiality, maybe?

382
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,760
我不太懂法律知識
I'm a little hazy on the legal points,

383
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,550
但如果我告訴你我聽到的
but if I tell you what I heard

384
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,720
而不是直接告訴吉米
and not Jimmy directly,

385
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,190
就像一個緩沖...
like... like, we have a buffer,

386
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,300
那從法律上說我就是安全的咯
then legally, I'm safe?

387
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,370
歐尼
Ernie.

388
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,410
你到底在說什么啊
What the hell are you talking about?

389
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,410
我只是擔心吉米
I'm -- I'm just worried about Jimmy.

390
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,730
如果我告訴他...
But if I tell him...

391
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,150
我也不想惹上麻煩
I don't want to get in trouble, too.

392
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,040
告訴吉米什么
Tell Jimmy what?

393
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,440
莉莉  謝謝你帶你母親過來
Lily, I want to thank you for bringing your mom down.

394
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,820
很高興見到您  年輕女士
It was a delight to meet you, young lady.

395
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,340
謝謝你  吉米
Thank you, Jimmy.

396
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,270
告訴您的朋友們
And you tell your friends,

397
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,520
就算他們已經立了遺囑
even if they already have a will,

398
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,630
更新也是很重要的
it's important to get it updated,

399
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,240
-就像您一樣  -我會告訴他們的
- just like you did. - I'll tell them.

400
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,510
這位是弗朗西斯卡
Now, you remember Francesca --

401
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,710
接下來她會幫你處理好的
she'll take care of you the rest of the way.

402
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,180
好了  下一個  威切爾先生
All right, who's next? Mr. Witchell.

403
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,340
威切爾先生  該您了
Mr. Witchell, come on down!

404
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,800
您是"稱心價"的下一位選手
You're the next contestant on "The Price is Right"!

405
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,510
吉米  可以借用幾分鐘嗎
Jimmy, can I have a moment?

406
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,980
-抱歉  先生  -看起來一切都...
- Excuse me, sir. - Um, looks like everything is...

407
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,450
抱歉  威切爾先生
Apologies, Mr. Witchell.

408
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,040
-我過會就回來  -天啊
- I'll just be a second, folks. - Oh, my gosh.

409
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,540
你們今天在餅干桶餐館喝過湯嗎
Have you guys had the soup over at Cracker Barrel today?

410
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,690
怎么了
What?

411
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,400
怎么了  快說呀
What?! Hey, come on.

412
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,830
還有委托人在等我
I got people out there.

413
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,690
-在聽嗎   我不...  -給我一美元
- Hello. I can't -- - Give me a dollar.

414
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,760
-給你一美元  -沒錯  給我就行
- Give you a dollar? - Yeah, just hand me a dollar.

415
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,780
-好吧  -快
- Okay. - C'mon.

416
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,400
我只有一張二十的
All I got's a $20.

417
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,540
好  無所謂
Fine. Whatever.

418
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,590
我現在是你的律師
All right. I'm your lawyer now.

419
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,010
如果有人問我知道什么
If anyone asks me what I know,

420
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,230
我們就有保密協議了
we have confidentiality.

421
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,230
我們為什么要保密
Why do we need confidentiality?

422
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,560
吉米  你跟查克說什么了
Jimmy, what did you say to Chuck?

423
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,780
終于來了
Here it comes.

424
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,160
是霍華德吧
Howard, right?

425
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,210
霍華德給你打電話了  別緊張
Did Howard call? R-Relax.

426
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,210
不  請讓我解釋
No. Let me explain, please.

427
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,220
拜托
Please.

428
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,250
金  讓我給你說明一下  好嗎
Kim, let me set the stage for you, okay?

429
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,000
我上周去查克家時
When I went to Chuck's place last week,

430
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,680
好像進了爆米花包裝袋里一樣
it was like the inside of a Jiffy Pop wrapper, all right?

431
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,140
墻面上都是聚酯薄膜
There was Mylar on the walls.

432
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,570
連天花板上都是聚酯薄膜  天花板上
There was Mylar on the ceiling -- the ceiling.

433
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,740
他以為他的腦子壞掉了
He thought his brain wasn't working

434
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,710
因為梅薩維德那件事
because of the Mesa Verde of it,

435
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,190
所以我跟他說
and so I kinda told him

436
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,070
他之前的猜想都是對的
that he was right about everything.

437
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,120
我必須這么做
I had to.

438
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,130
他  他  金  他崩潰了
He -- He -- Kim, he was broken.

439
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,470
他崩潰了啊
He was a broken man!

440
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,650
我不能讓他那樣瘋癲下去
I couldn't leave him in Crazy Town like that!

441
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,250
所以我跟他說了  為了讓他好受些
So I told him, you know, just to make him feel better,

442
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,550
但是他說什么都不要緊
but it doesn't matter what he says --

443
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,770
他告訴誰都沒關系
it doesn't matter who he tells,

444
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,400
因為空口無憑
because it's my word against his!

445
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,010
吉米  有錄音帶
Jimmy, there's a tape.

446
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,530
什么
What?

447
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,570
有一卷錄了你和查克對話的錄音帶
There is a tape recording of you talking to Chuck.

448
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,550
你什么意思  誰錄的
What do you mean? Who? Who?

449
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,550
他對我錄了音  怎么錄的
He -- He taped me? How?

450
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,760
我不知道怎么錄的
I don't know how.

451
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,730
他就是錄了  好嗎  歐尼告訴我的
He just did, okay? Ernie told me.

452
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,060
歐尼告訴你的
Ernie told you?

453
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,820
他說查克把一個錄音機
He said Chuck has a tape recorder

454
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,290
卷在太空毯里  放在他書桌的抽屜里
wrapped in a space blanket in his desk drawer.

455
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,770
歐尼給錄音機換新電池時
Ernie was putting new batteries in it for Chuck,

456
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,630
錄單帶播了幾秒
and the tape rolled for a few seconds,

457
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,360
他聽到你  你的聲音...
and he heard you -- your voice --

458
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,450
在說什么把1261改成了1216
saying something about switching 1261 to 1216.

459
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,600
很顯然  這是你的認罪錄音
So, clearly, it was this confession of yours.

460
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,080
他對我錄了音
He taped me?

461
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,870
是的  吉米
Yes, Jimmy.

462
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,300
但是我不確定他能用它干什么...
But I'm not sure what he can do with it...

463
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,510
反正法律上來講是這樣
...legally, anyway.

464
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,700
我得去研究一下
I'm gonna have to do some research.

465
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,000
他錄這卷帶子是有原因的
He made that tape for a reason,

466
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,610
我們只要找出原因就行了
and we just have to figure out why.

467
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,920
吉米
Jimmy?

468
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,890
我得回去了
I gotta get back to it.

469
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,340
大廳里都是委托人
The lobby's full of clients.

470
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,260
好的
Okay.

471
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,770
我們會有辦法解決的
We'll figure this out.

472
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,690
是的  我知道
Yeah. I know.

473
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,500
抱歉讓大家久等了
Sorry for the delay, everyone!

474
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,250
威切爾先生  感謝您的耐心
Mr. Witchell, thank you for your patience.

475
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,120
我看到您把文件都帶來了
I see you brought paperwork.

476
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,230
我得說
I got to say,

477
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,720
我絕對想不到可以收集瓶蓋
I would never have thought to collect bottle caps.

478
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,890
這是個很棒的愛好
It's a wonderful hobby.

479
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,870
最吸引我的就是搜尋的過程
What excites me is the hunt.

480
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,780
我可以想像
I can imagine.

481
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,930
跟您合作很愉快  蒂勒先生
Pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Tiller.

482
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,720
謝謝你  吉米
Why, thank you, Jimmy.

483
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,800
好了  您開車小心
All right, then. You drive safe.

484
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,820
我會的
I do.

485
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,360
這是最后一個了嗎
Is that the last one,

486
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,720
我們有落下什么人嗎
or we got any stragglers coming through?

487
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,990
是最后一個
Last one.

488
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,560
好的  謝謝  弗朗西斯卡
Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.

489
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,180
你今天表現非常棒
You were great today.

490
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,480
你也是
You, too.

491
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,800
這些老家伙喜歡你
Those folks love you.

492
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,580
誰會不喜歡我呢
Who doesn't?

493
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,090
是麥基弗公訴案嗎
And that's U.S. versus McKeever?

494
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,190
好的  不  有道理
Right. No, it makes sense.

495
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,280
你對我的幫助非常大  教授
You were a tremendous help, professor.

496
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,760
謝謝你抽出時間
Thanks for finding the time.

497
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,660
你也是
You, too.

498
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,370
再次感謝你
Thanks again.

499
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,730
弗朗西斯卡  能幫我個忙嗎
Francesca, could you do me a favor?

500
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,160
去我的辦公室  把梅薩維德文件里
Can you go through the Mesa Verde files in my office

501
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,490
貼有《社區再投資法案》標簽的文件拿出來
and pull all the ones labeled "CRA evaluations"

502
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,560
然后按時間排個序  好嗎
and sort them by date?

503
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,240
我要確保我有最新的文件
I need to make sure I have the most recent.

504
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,900
-沒問題  -謝謝你
- Absolutely. - Thank you.

505
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,580
-我馬上就去找你  -好的
- I'll join you in a minute. - Okay.

506
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,400
我剛剛給我以前的
So... just got off the phone

507
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,460
刑事訴訟法教授打了電話
with my old Crim-Pro professor.

508
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,980
是嗎  他怎么說
Oh, yeah? What'd he say?

509
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,400
新墨西哥州實行"一方同意"
Well, as we know, New Mexico is one-party consent,

510
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,520
所以查克有權錄音
so Chuck had a right to make the recording.

511
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,180
但你去找他是擔心他的精神狀況
But you went to him worried for his mental health.

512
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,920
告訴他你做過的事是為了安慰他
You said the things you did to make him feel better,

513
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,870
這至少會減輕你的認罪程度
which mitigates the admission of guilt, at the very least.

514
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,740
我們可以從監護權這方面著手
We can poke holes in the custody,

515
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,350
質疑錄音帶里的聲音不是你的
throw doubt the voice on the tape is even yours.

516
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,710
即使不成功
Even failing that,

517
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,720
該證據的有害影響也高過其證明價值
its probative value doesn't outweigh how prejudicial it is.

518
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,680
我們可以利用403法案反駁
I think we can get the whole thing bounced under 403.

519
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,060
也許可以將它徹底排除在證據之外
Probably get it excluded outright.

520
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,450
那么...
So, then...

521
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,650
法庭之外  又能做什么呢
outside the courts, what can you do?

522
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,650
放給梅薩維德的凱文聽嗎
Play the tape for Kevin at Mesa Verde?

523
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,610
他到目前為止都還沒有
He hasn't up to now.

524
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,430
否則我肯定聽到風聲
I'd have heard something, for sure.

525
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,090
而且我認為他不會那樣做
And you know what? I don't think he's going to.

526
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,550
霍華德不會任由他把那盤帶子送到梅薩維德
I don't think Howard will let him near Mesa Verde with that tape.

527
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,460
他知道那會有損律所的形象
Howard knows it would make HHM look terrible.

528
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,180
如果查克對那盤帶子有所計劃
If Chuck has a plan for this tape,

529
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,670
我猜不到會是什么
I don't know what it is.

530
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,520
現在  我們只能等他先出招
At this point, all we can do is wait for his move,

531
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,090
再采取相應的行動
then act accordingly.

532
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,180
那好吧
All right, then.

533
00:41:58,930 --> 00:41:59,840
謝謝
Thanks.

534
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,040
不客氣
Sure.

535
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,850
對了  你覺得怎么樣
Oh, hey, what do you think?

536
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,580
這是"藍色練習曲"搭配"白日夢收獲"
It's "Etude in Blue" over "Daydream Harvest."

537
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,600
我希望看起來像桑迪亞斯的清晨
I wanted it to look like morning over the Sandias.

538
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,600
我喜歡  很漂亮
I like it. It looks nice.

539
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,950
看起來不會像股市崩盤嗎
It doesn't look like a stock-market crash?

540
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,510
不會  一點都不像
No. It doesn't look like a stock-market crash.

541
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,070
很漂亮
It's nice.

542
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,990
謝謝
Thanks.

543
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,400
你還好吧
You okay?

544
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,160
金  我沒事
Kim, I'm good.

545
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,860
喂
Yeah.

546
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,880
霍華德  你來這里干什么
Howard, what are you doing here?

547
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,260
-查克  你有空嗎  -你有沒有...
- Chuck, do you have a second? - Did you --

548
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,920
你有沒有把車停到隔壁街
You parked over on the next block?

549
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,530
有  停得很遠
Oh, yeah. Way over.

550
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,430
手機  鑰匙
Phone. Keys.

551
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,060
你得把它們藏起來
You have to hide them.

552
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,500
沒事吧  先生
Everything okay, sir?

553
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,020
沒事  謝謝  大衛  你先下去吧
Yes, thank you, David. Give us a moment.

554
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,960
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

555
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,940
-怎么了  -查克
- What's up? - Chuck...

556
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,060
這事已經過了八天了
this has been going on for eight days now,

557
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,490
確實沒有任何跡象表明能成功
and really, no indication that it's going to work.

558
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,600
會成功的
It will work.

559
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,150
我自認很有耐心了
I think I've been very patient,

560
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,340
可是
but the cost of these

561
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,580
請這些全天候私家偵探的費用
'round-the-clock private investigators is...

562
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,170
真的非常高昂
really starting to add up.

563
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,600
霍華德  這是我們的職責
Howard, this is our duty.

564
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,000
身為律師
As officers of the court,

565
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,860
我們有義務去...
we have an ethical obligation to --

566
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,660
-沒錯  -我弟弟觸犯了法律
- Yes. - My brother broke the law.

567
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,450
我們不能袖手旁觀
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

568
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,250
我不是要你什么都不做
I'm not talking about doing nothing.

569
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,020
我只是想...  思路放寬點
I just want to... free up our minds

570
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,500
對其他策略保持開放態度
and be open to alternate strategies, please.

571
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,600
我們各讓一步吧
Meet me halfway here.

572
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:41,710
我們  我們可以只在夜間
I suppose -- I suppose we could limit the investigators

573
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,550
聘請私家偵探
to just nighttime hours.

574
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,260
-夜間  -是的
- Nighttime. - Yes.

575
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,750
吉米很可能趁我睡覺時
Jimmy will most likely break in

576
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,630
偷偷闖進來
while he thinks I'm sleeping --

577
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,230
他什么都做得出來
I mean, I wouldn't put anything past him.

578
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,530
只是最合理的猜測是
It just makes the most sense

579
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,830
他會趁著天黑進來偷帶子
he'll try to steal the tape under cover of darkness.

580
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,550
你真的認為他會那樣做
You really think he's going to do that?

581
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,010
是的
I do, indeed.

582
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,250
你怎么能如此肯定呢
How can you be so sure?

583
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:05,190
霍華德  我很了解我的弟弟
Howard, I know my brother.

584
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,260
查克
Chuck!

585
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,060
查克
Chuck!

586
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,790
快開門  查克
Open the damn door, Chuck!

587
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:16,400
快開門啊
Open the door, damn it!

588
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,160
-開門  查克  -吉米  你走吧
- Open it! Chuck! - Jimmy, go away!

589
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,280
開門啊
Open the door!

590
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,700
-給我開門  -我不會開門的
- Open it now! - I'm not opening the door!

591
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,430
-我發誓  查克  -我不會開...  吉米
- I swear to God, Chuck... - I am not op-- Jimmy!

592
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:27,060
-吉米  -你居然把我的話錄下來  混蛋
- Jimmy! - You taped me?! You asshole!

593
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,580
吉米
Jimmy!

594
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,000
你假裝跟我掏心掏肺
You pulled that heartstrings con job on me?!

595
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,020
你個人渣
You piece of shit!

596
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:34,850
"我的頭腦曾經那么敏捷
"My brain used to work.

597
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,770
我病了  我不知道如何是好"
I'm sick. I don't know what to do!"

598
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,140
混蛋
Asshole!

599
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,340
難怪麗貝卡離開你了
No wonder Rebecca left you!

600
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,050
她怎么能忍你那么久
What took her so long?!

601
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,490
找到了
There it is!

602
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,030
來吧
Here we go.

603
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,310
來吧
