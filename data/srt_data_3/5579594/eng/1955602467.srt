1
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,528
Chuck: You can move
the red five up.

2
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,530
Man:
Oh, yeah.

3
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,399
Thank you, sir.

4
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,503
Why do the cards
have holes in them?

5
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,171
Oh.

6
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,540
They're, uh -- these are
used cards from the casino.

7
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,376
Once the casino pulls
a deck of cards out of action,

8
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,780
they drill a hole through them
and sell 'em to the public.

9
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,715
Just a buck or 2.

10
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,485
Look at that.

11
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:04,556
I suppose that's to prevent
people from cheating with them.

12
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,858
Yeah.

13
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,227
Makes for
a good souvenir.

14
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,862
These are
from caesars.

15
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,564
Mm.
I've never been.

16
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,299
Hmmm.

17
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,640
Getting dark.

18
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,643
I hate to say it,

19
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,912
but I think it might be time
to kill the lights.

20
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,647
Oh, yes, sir.
Of course.

21
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,252
You sure I can't make you
a cup of tea?

22
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,587
I'm fine, sir.
Thank you.

23
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,322
All right,
then.

24
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,952
Ohh.

25
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,255
Just what I needed.

26
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,259
Drink up, guys.
Don't need you fallin' asleep.

27
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,995
Hey, you take care
of that battery?

28
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,863
Oh, yeah.
It finally shit the bed,

29
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,267
but we swapped it out
a couple hours ago.

30
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,903
Okay.
How'd it go?

31
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,372
No problem.

32
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:36,275
Anyone see you?
Nah.
Dead over there.

33
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,346
A'ight.

34
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,914
Stay awake.

35
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,182
hello?

36
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,184
Jimmy: Oh, hey.
Come on in.

37
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,854
Hi.
I'm Francesca liddy.

38
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,188
I'm here
for the interview.

39
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,357
Oh.
Jimmy mcgill.

40
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,893
Hey, are you, uh, running early,
or am I running late?

41
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,495
No, sorry.
I'm a little early.

42
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:44,896
It's not a problem.

43
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,397
Never bad
to be early...

44
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,834
Except in death and taxes
and...Some other things.

45
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,837
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

46
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,205
Sure.

47
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,408
Does that
look straight to you?

48
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,810
Uh...

49
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,846
I think there --
that -- that side --

50
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,549
I think
you're a little crooked --

51
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,785
the bottom
of the "m" there.

52
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,290
Yeah.
A little crooked.

53
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,562
So, you're coming off
of seven years at the mvd?

54
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,030
I am, yeah.

55
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,532
Here's a question --
how come new Mexico

56
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,268
doesn't call it the dmv
like every other state?

57
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,103
Well,
that's a great question.

58
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,838
Uh,
just like in Arizona,

59
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,508
the motor vehicles division
is part of the dot, a division,

60
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,278
whereas,
in most other states, the dmv,

61
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,548
or department of motor vehicles
is its own entity, so...

62
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,583
I don't know
if that answers the question,

63
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,885
except to say
that's the government for you.

64
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,821
You got that right.

65
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,423
Well, I, for one,
am not calling it the mvd --

66
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,925
dmv all the way.

67
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,461
What do you think you learned
the most working there?

68
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,130
Patience, diplomacy.

69
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,466
Uh, you meet a-all sorts
of people down there,

70
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,268
a-and most are really great,
really friendly,

71
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,305
but you encounter some
who are upset, belligerent.

72
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,573
What about old folks?

73
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,974
Uh, you get
your fair share of them?

74
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,876
Oh, lots of
elderly drivers.

75
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,445
After 75, they need
to take their test again,

76
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,113
so if
they don't pass,

77
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,348
you have to
explain to them

78
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,583
why their license
isn't being renewed,

79
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,984
which is hard
for them.

80
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,285
What do you say then?

81
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,887
Do you ever...
Yell at them?

82
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,121
I mean, geezers,
right?

83
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,257
How can you not?

84
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,392
No,
i would never.

85
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,094
No.

86
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,629
Nor should you.
That was a trick question.

87
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,965
You passed
with flying colors -- very good.

88
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,967
Okay.

89
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:33,271
Well, then, so, Jimmy and i
have very different needs.

90
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:37,308
His practice is mostly wills
for senior citizens,

91
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,111
while I'm focused on
a single client at the moment,

92
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,013
mesa verde,
with banking regulations

93
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,615
that generate
a ton of paperwork,

94
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,984
so I'm looking
for someone

95
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,952
with an eye for organization
and detail.

96
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,320
Jimmy: Well,
dmv's great for that --

97
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,389
tons of detail
in those driver's licenses.

98
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,424
We did see hundreds of people
every day,

99
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,326
and you'd never
want to let a mistake

100
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,928
slip through
on their forms.

101
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,997
You'd just have
a horrible cascade of problems.

102
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,999
Sounds challenging.

103
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,501
So, why the law?

104
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,637
I mean, why leave the dmv --
or mvd?

105
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,171
I have to imagine

106
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,340
you'll be giving up
a good benefits package.

107
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,176
Good healthcare
and retirement plans, but...

108
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,646
There's a bureaucracy
to government work

109
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:18,016
that ultimately
became too frustrating.

110
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,651
I guess what you'd call it --
too much red tape.

111
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,021
I just want to be somewhere
i can make a difference.

112
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,456
Well, that's us. We're all about
making a difference.

113
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,392
And I see here
both word and excel --

114
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,960
you're comfortable with?
Absolutely.

115
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,194
Excel<i> and</i> word?
Wow.

116
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,030
Well, you had me
at old people.

117
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,432
Hey, here's a question --
can you start today?

118
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,700
I, uh...
Can --

119
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,568
yes?

120
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,003
Fantastic.
Now,
can you --

121
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,340
Can you just
give us a second, Francesca?

122
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,675
Absolutely. I...

123
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,076
Of course.

124
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,045
Um...
Thank you.

125
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,447
Uh-huh.

126
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,352
What are you doing?

127
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,387
What?
I like her.

128
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,956
"Can you start today?"

129
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,691
Don't you think we should see
some more résumés --

130
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,225
like,
a lot more?

131
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,694
She is
our first interview.

132
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,996
We haven't even
checked her references.

133
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,631
So we'll check 'em.

134
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,733
Kim, you've been takin' forever
searching for a paralegal.

135
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,134
We need help here.

136
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,569
I haven't found
the right fit.

137
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,471
Yeah, 'cause you're searching
for perfection,

138
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,606
and perfection is the enemy
of perfectly adequate.

139
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,308
Oh, so that's the bar here --
adequate?

140
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,711
She's<i> more</i> than adequate!
She worked at the dmv.

141
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,579
That's like
the fifth circle of hell.

142
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,281
Look,
she's overqualified.

143
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,083
I-if it doesn't work out,
we can fire her.

144
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,551
It's no big deal.

145
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,152
Don't you think someone with
some actual legal experience

146
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,420
would be better?

147
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,522
Look, I've got a commercial
airing in...

148
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,191
11 minutes,

149
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,592
so the phones are
gonna be ringin' off the hook

150
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,060
and I need help.

151
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,595
Can we give her
a test run, please?

152
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,597
I got a good feeling
about this.

153
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,701
Come on, Kim.

154
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,407
Now, getting these oldsters
to call --

155
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,641
that's half the battle,

156
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,543
so they need to hear
a friendly voice.

157
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,745
Friendly? Absolutely.

158
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,413
Speak loudly
and clearly,

159
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,749
but, uh, be careful
with the loud and clear,

160
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,118
'cause it can come off
as angry.

161
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,319
Be folksy.

162
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,653
Put a little sunshine
in your voice.

163
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,055
Got it.
Okay.

164
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,456
You need coffee
or water?

165
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,091
You need to hit the head
before things --

166
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,459
Oh, there it goes.

167
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,431
Offices of Jimmy mcgill.
How may I help you?

168
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,134
I'm sorry.

169
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,469
May I put you on hold?
Thank you.

170
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,605
Offices of Jimmy mcgill.

171
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,207
Please hold.

172
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,542
Sorry about that.

173
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,211
What can I do
for you?

174
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,049
Uh, that's right.

175
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,751
Jimmy mcgill
from the commercial.

176
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,354
Would you look to come in
for a consultation?

177
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,389
Folksy -- be folksy.

178
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,326
Say, is that
a dog I'm hearing?

179
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,694
It is?

00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,164

00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,465
Yeah,

182
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,667
It always helps
to mention cracker barrel.

183
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,503
Well, I think it's great
you let Margaret play inside.

184
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,138
It's a hot one
out there.

185
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
I was thinking
of going over to cracker barrel

186
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,409
because they've got
such great air-conditioning.

187
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,646
Well, yes,
i love their biscuits, too.

188
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,849
Well,
that's wonderful.

189
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,451
Mm-hmm.

190
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,353
Yes, I think a will
<i> is</i> really important.

191
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,457

206
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,461

00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,365
uh, you sound like
you're outdoors.

out of the sun?

209
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,635
It's a hot one today.

210
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,639
I'm sorry, but Jimmy
is unavailable at the moment.

211

00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,485
Uh, I hear cracker barrel
has excellent air--

215
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,489
this one really don't want
to talk about cracker barrel.

216
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,658
Yeah,
patch that one through.

217
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,294
Mr. mcgill

218
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,599
Hey.

219
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,601
Mike: Your new assistant's
a real pip.

220
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,404

her spirit on the first day.

00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,208
Thank you, sir.
You drive safe.

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,777

225
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,927
Mike: All right,
this is what you're gonna do.

226
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,796
You're gonna go inside,
buy a cup of coffee, a meal --

227
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,798
whatever --
and sit in a booth.

228
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,234
Sometime in the next
10 to 15 minutes,

229
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,303
a guy
in an old green Chevy blazer

230
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,471
is gonna pull into
that parking lot.

231
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,874
He'll take a knapsack,
and he'll go inside.

232
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,443
I need you to keep an eye
on the knapsack.

233
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,478
Let me know
what he does with it.

234
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,813
Does he take
anything out of it?

235
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,249
Does he switch the bag
with someone?

236
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,818
Does he leave
something from the bag inside?

237
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,954
Jimmy: Right, right, right.
I got it.

238
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,822
Green Chevy blazer,
black top.

239
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,425
Yeah.
What's in the bag?

240
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,659
Is it money?

241
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,595
It's got to be money.

242
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,663
Drugs?
Is it drugs?

243
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,232

244
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,633
Well, um,

He is gonna be here
any minute.

247
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,605
Now,
i need you inside.

248
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,506
You gonna do the job

249
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,741
Fine.

250
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,345

00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,094
Y'know,
they say a nice watch band

294
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,929
is as important
as the watch.

295
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,165
That's what I get
for cheapin' out.

296
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,702
We'll find it
for you.

297
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,205
Where the heck
is it?

298
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,774
Oh, don't worry.

There it is.

Oh.

302
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,448
May I clean this

303
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,849
We have alcohol wipes.

304
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,818
Oh, nah,

305
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,119
Thank you.

00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,888

Thanks.

310
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,962
You take care.

311
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,299
Mike:
Tell me again.

312
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,801
Jesus.

313
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,436
How many different ways
you want me to say it?

314
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,371
Just tell me
what you saw.

315
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,873
He came in,
like you said he would.

316
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,744
He ordered the number three
with potatoes and coffee,

317
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,113
went bold
with the extra salsa,

318
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,982
and he paid cash
out of his left front pocket.

319
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,818
Uh, took his tray
of food,

320
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,320
sat in a booth on the east side
of the restaurant,

321
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,456
and put the knapsack
on the floor.

322
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,890
Where on the floor?

323
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,926
Under his seat,
between his legs.

324
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:50,260
Nobody touched it.

325
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,396
He didn't talk
to anybody.

326
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,998
He didn't even
<i> look</i> at anybody.

327
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,101
Finished his meal
in five minutes, tops,

328
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,503
and skedaddled --
didn't leave anything behind.

329
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,004
And you're sure of that?

330
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,974
I literally
checked the trash can.

331
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,343
There was nothing in there
but trash.

332
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,815
So...What's our next move,
huh?

333
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,451
Are we gonna follow
this guy?

334
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,988
'Cause you -- you got some
real James Bond stuff in here.

335
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,891
This car doesn't have
an ejector seat, does it?

336
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,926
I think
we're done for today.

337
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,929
That's it?
That's it.

338
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,167
I mean,
i cleared my morning.

339
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,870
What --
we're not gonna do, like,

340
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,039
uh, Tail him
to a new location?

341
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,475
Or, I mean, we got to
sit on him, at least. I --

342
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:43,781
thanks for your time.

343
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:54,391
Hey,
who's got your back, huh?

344
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,794
Me -- that's who.

345
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,300
I'll keep that
in mind.

346
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,979

347
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,144

353
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,686
of those dietetic
butter cookies?

354
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,088
I can check.

355
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,422
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

356
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,091
Welcome, folks!

357
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,338
Hey, Ernie. What's up?

358
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,745
Can't you just come inside?

359
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:49,760
Sorry.

360
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,130
Thanks.

361
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,731
What are we doing
out here?

362
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,466
I didn't want
to call you

363
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:59,169
because then it would leave
a phone record.

364
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,637
I was gonna come in,

365
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,473
but then I thought
maybe Jimmy shouldn't see me.

366
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,775
So...

367
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,777
But you just called me.

368
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,345
Oh.

369
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,547
Guess I screwed up already.

370
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,783
Ernie,
screwed what up?

371
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,317
Why don't you want
to see Jimmy?

372
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:18,655
Well, it's just...

373
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,257
I'm not sure
how to start.

374
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,559
You can start
by just telling me.

375
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,695
Here's the thing.

376
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,130
I have
some information,

377
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,665
but I don't want
to get in trouble.

378
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,134
Trouble with Jimmy?

379
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:33,270
No.
With hhm.

380
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:36,106
I think I'm bound
by confidentiality, maybe?

381
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:38,508
I'm a little hazy
on the legal points,

382
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,680
but if I tell<i> you</i> what I heard
and not Jimmy directly,

383
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:46,750
like...
Like, we have a buffer,

384
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,852
then legally, I'm safe?

385
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,353
Ernie.

386
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,155
What the hell
are you talking about?

387
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,326
I'm -- I'm just worried
about Jimmy.

388
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,428
But if I tell him...

389
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,265
I don't want
to get in trouble, too.

390
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:06,269
Tell Jimmy what?

391
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,273
Lily, I want to thank you
for bringing your mom down.

392
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,275
It was a delight
to meet<i> you,</i> young lady.

393
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,844
Oh. Thank you, Jimmy.

394
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,712
And you tell your friends,
even if they already

395
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,547
have a will, it's important
to get it updated,

396
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,716
just like you did.
I'll tell them.

397
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,384
Now,
you remember Francesca --

398
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,753
she'll take care of you
the rest of the way.

399
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,856
All right, who's next?
Mr. witchell.

400
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,657
Mr. witchell,
come on down!

401
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,594
You're the next contestant
on "the price is right"!

402
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,395
Jimmy,
can I have a moment?

403
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,197
Excuse me, sir.
Um,
looks like everything is...

404
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,732
Apologies,
Mr. witchell.

405
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,667
Uh, I'll just be
a second, folks.
Oh, my gosh.

406
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,736
Have you guys had the soup
over at cracker barrel today?

407
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,242
What?

408
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,410
What?!
Hey, come on.

409
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,246
I got people
out there.

410
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,515
Hello.
I can't --
gimme a dollar.

411
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,250
Give you a dollar?
Yeah,
just hand me a dollar.

412
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,451
Okay.
C'mon.

413
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,220
All I got's a $20.

414
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,421
Fine. Whatever.

415
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,757
All right.
I'm your lawyer now.

416
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,759
If anyone
asks me what I know,

417
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,261
we have confidentiality.

418
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,595
Why do we need
confidentiality?

419
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,265
Jimmy,
what did you say to Chuck?

420
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,534
Oh.

421
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:12,335
Here it comes.

422
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,904
Howard, right?

423
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,906
Did Howard call?
R-relax.

424
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,607
No.
Let me explain, please.

425
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,176
Please.

426
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,912
Kim, let me set the stage
for you, okay?

427
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,613
When I went
to Chuck's place last week,

428
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,482
it was like the inside
of a jiffy pop wrapper,

429
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,683
all right?

430
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,318
There was mylar
on the walls.

431
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,754
There was mylar
on the ceiling -- the ceiling.

432
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,789
He thought
his brain wasn't working

433
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,791
because of
the mesa verde of it,

434
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:39,729
and so I kinda told him that
he was right about everything.

435
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:40,931
I had to.

436
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,832
He -- he --
Kim, he was broken.

437
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,301
He was
a broken man!

438
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:46,303
I couldn't leave him
in crazy town like that!

439
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,872
So I told him, you know,
just to make him feel better,

440
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,507
but it doesn't matter
what he says --

441
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,775
it doesn't matter
who he tells,

442
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,310
because it's my word
against his!

443
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,978
Jimmy,
there's a tape.

444
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,447
What?

445
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,884
There is a tape recording
of you talking to Chuck.

446
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,487
What do you mean?
Who? Who?

447
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,489
He -- he taped me?
How?

448
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,791
I don't know how.

449
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,493
He just did, okay?
Ernie told me.

450
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,695
Ernie told you?

451
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,396
He said Chuck
has a tape recorder

452
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,832
wrapped in a space blanket
in his desk drawer.

453
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,767
Ernie was putting new batteries
in it for Chuck,

454
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,502
and the tape rolled
for a few seconds,

455
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,838
and he heard you --
your voice --

456
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,008
saying something about
switching 1261 to 1216.

457
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,877
So, clearly, it was
this confession of yours.

458
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,749
He taped me?

459
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,929
Yes, Jimmy.

460
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,602
But I'm not sure
what he can do with it...

461
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,940
...legally, anyway.

462
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,944
I'm gonna have to
do some research.

463
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,447
He made that tape
for a reason,

464
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,983
and we just have to
figure out why.

465
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,859
Jimmy?

466
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,462
I gotta
get back to it.

467
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,399
The lobby's
full of clients.

468
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay.

469
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:28,038
We'll figure this out.

470
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Yeah. I know.

471
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,377
Sorry for the delay,
everyone!

472
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,979
Mr. witchell,
thank you for your Patience.

473
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,380
I see
you brought paperwork.

474
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,488
I got to say,
i would never have thought

475
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,990
to collect bottle caps.

476
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,059
Oh,
it's a wonderful hobby.

477
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,661
What excites me
is the hunt.

478
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,930
I can imagine.

479
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,765
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. tiller.

480
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,934
Why,
thank you, Jimmy.

481
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,602
All right, then.
You drive safe.

482
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,838
Oh, I do.

483
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,079
Is that
the last one,

484
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:11,614
or we got any stragglers
coming through?

485
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,882
Francesca: Last one.

486
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,519
Well, hey,
thanks, Francesca.

487
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,088
You were great today.

488
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,622
You, too.

489
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,458
Those folks love you.

490
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,396
Who doesn't?

491
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,773
And that's
U.S. v. McKeever?

492
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:39,376
Right. No, it makes sense.

493
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,112
You were a tremendous help,
professor.

494
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:45,048
Thanks for finding the time.

495
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,717
You, too.

496
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,686
Thanks again.

497
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,728
Francesca,
could you do me a favor?

498
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,930
Can you go through the
mesa verde files in my office

499
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,799
and pull all the ones
labeled "cra evaluations"

500
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,134
and sort them
by date?

501
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,136
I need to make sure
i have the most recent.

502
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,505
Absolutely.
Thank you.

503
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,441
I'll join you
in a minute.
Okay.

504
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:16,146
So...
Just got off the phone

505
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,148
with my old
crim-pro professor.

506
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,849
Oh, yeah?
What'd he say?

507
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,152
Well, as we know,
new Mexico is one-party consent,

508
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,854
so Chuck had a right
to make the recording.

509
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:28,625
But you went to him
worried for his mental health.

510
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:30,660
You said the things you did
to make him feel better,

511
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,861
which

512
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,163
Mitigates
the admission of guilt,

513
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:35,098
at the very least.

514
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,701
We can poke holes
in the custody,

515
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,904
throw doubt the voice
on the tape is even yours.

516
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,639
Even failing that,

517
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,542
its probative value doesn't
outweigh how prejudicial it is.

518
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:48,711
I think we can get the
whole thing bounced under 403.

519
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,947
Probably get it
excluded outright.

520
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,150
So, then...

521
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,787
Outside the courts,
what can you do?

522
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,192
Play the tape for Kevin
at mesa verde?

523
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:03,593
He hasn't
up to now.

524
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:04,961
I'd have heard something,
for sure.

525
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,896
And you know what?
I don't think he's going to.

526
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,731
I don't think Howard
will let him near mesa verde

527
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,066
with that tape.

528
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,469
Howard knows it would make hhm
look terrible.

529
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,077
If Chuck has a plan
for this tape,

530
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,645
I don't know
what it is.

531
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,648
At this point, all we can do
is wait for his move,

532
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,983
then act accordingly.

533
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,058
All right, then.

534
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,493
Thanks.

535
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,161
Sure.

536
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,598
Oh, hey,
what do you think?

537
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,236
Um, it's "etude in blue"
over "daydream harvest."

538
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:48,605
I wanted it to look like morning
over the sandias.

539
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:51,574
I like it.
It looks nice.

540
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,643
It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash?

541
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:54,878
No.

542
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,780
It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash.

543
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,782
It's nice.

544
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,150
Thanks.

545
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,591
You okay?

546
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,696
Kim, I'm good.

547
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,193
Yeah.

548
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,478
Howard,
what are you doing here?

549
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,314
Chuck,
do you have a second?
Did you --

550
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,249
you parked
over on the next block?
Oh, yeah.

551
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,018
Mm.
Way over.

552
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,020
Uh, phone.
Keys.

553
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,256
Hey, you have to
hide them.

554
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,838
Everything okay,
sir?

555
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,573
Yes,
thank you, David.
Give us a moment.

556
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,107
Yes, sir.

557
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,412
What's up?
Chuck...

558
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:32,949
This has been going on
for eight days now,

559
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:35,284
and really, no indication
that it's going to work.

560
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,485
It will work.

561
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,521
I think
I've been very patient,

562
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,123
but the cost of these

563
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,126
'round-the-clock
private investigators is...

564
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,128
Really starting
to add up.

565
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,431
Howard,
this is our duty.

566
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,967
As officers
of the court,

567
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,602
we have
an ethical obligation to --

568
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:54,971
yes.
My brother
broke the law.

569
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:57,273
We can't just sit back
and do nothing.

570
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,308
I'm not talking about
doing nothing.

571
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,311
I just want to...
Free up our minds

572
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:05,982
and be open
to alternate strategies, please.

573
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,619
Meet me halfway here.

574
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:17,360
I suppose -- I suppose
we could limit the investigators

575
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,362
to just nighttime hours.

576
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:20,563
Nighttime.
Yes.

577
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,632
Jimmy will most likely
break in

578
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:24,467
while he thinks
I'm sleeping --

579
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,636
I mean, I wouldn't
put anything past him.

580
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:28,337
It just
makes the most sense

581
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,539
he'll try to steal the tape
under cover of darkness.

582
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,341
You really think
he's going to do that?

583
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:34,010
I do, indeed.

584
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:36,279
How can you be
so sure?

585
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:40,683
Howard,
I know my brother.

586
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,054
Jimmy: Chuck!

587
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:47,423
Chuck!

588
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,259
Open the damn door,
Chuck!

589
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,161
Open the door,
damn it!

590
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:53,462
Open it! Chuck!
Chuck:
Jimmy, go away!

591
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:55,031
Open the door!

592
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:56,632
Open it now!
I'm not
opening the door!

593
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:59,568
I swear to god,
Chuck...
I am not op--
Jimmy!

594
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,672
Jimmy!
You taped me?!
You asshole!

595
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:04,206
Jimmy!

596
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,708
You pulled that heartstrings con
job on me?!

597
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,243
You piece of shit!

598
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,680
"Ohh, my brain
used to work.

599
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,381
I'm sick.
I don't know what to do!"

600
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:13,683
Asshole!

601
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:16,185
No wonder
Rebecca left you!

602
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,721
What took her
so long?!

603
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,192
There it is!

604
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,098
Oh, here we go.

605
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,100
Here we go!

606
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,502
Here we go!

607
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,606
Oh!

608
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,376
Is this it?

609
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:41,677
Is this it?

610
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,212
Is this it?

611
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:44,680
Huh?

612
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,383
For this,
you destroyed our family?

613
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:48,751
You happy now?!

614
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,253
For what?!
For nothing!

615
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,690
Is that
all there is, Chuck?

616
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,360
It's all the --
all there is?

617
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:58,728
Or'd you make copies?
Huh, Chuck?

618
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,129
Huh?

619
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,597
You tell me,

620
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,399
or I'll burn this whole
goddamn house to the ground!

621
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,001
Jimmy! Jimmy!

622
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,268
That's enough!

623
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:09,405
You need
to step away.

624
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,274
Howard...

625
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:15,745
You were a witness
to what happened here?

626
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,279
I was.

627
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,547
And you?

628
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,483
I'm a witness.
