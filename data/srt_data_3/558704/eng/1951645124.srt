1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,400
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,100
Zach's gone from silvercrest.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,900
hungry?

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,700
Sometimes...

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,400
If I don't get some help, I will lose my mind.

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,100
Where can I score some high-grade nanny?

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,900
No matter how hard you try...

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,100
FBI. Open the door.

9
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,000
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant for your arrest.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,100
Some problems...

11
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,500
I-I'm sorry. And you are?

12
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,100
I take it you've met Maisy Gibbons.

13
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,400
She's a total nightmare.

14
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,600
Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.

15
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,800
You are unhappy with our sex life.

16
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,700
You're not getting something from me,
but you're simply too afraid to ask.

17
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,600
Can't be easily solved.

18
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,800


19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,400
To understand Maisy Gibbons,

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,800
you first need to know how she spent her afternoons.

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000


22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,300
Her mornings were spent running errands for her husband.

23
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,200
Hi.

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,500


25
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Her evenings were spent washing dishes
and helping with homework.

26
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,600
Um, okay, so 9 plus 1 is...

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:53,700


28
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,600
but her afternoons --

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,300
well, they were spent in the company of men.

30
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,600


31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Frustrated...

32
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,700
misunderstood...

33
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,000
lonely men willing to pay money
to feel a little less lonely.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,600


35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,300
And Maisy Gibbons was willing to help them.

36
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,700
Maisy, I've always wondered,

37
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,300
nobody knows about your little hobby, do they?

38
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,700
Mnh-mnh.

39
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:20,900


40
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,800
Is it hard keeping a secret like this?

41
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,200
Well, maybe if it was just my secret,

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,400


43
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,700
but the way I see it, I keep the secrets
of every man who comes to me,

44
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,200


45
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,700
and I find that absolutely exhilarating.

46
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,500


47
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,600
A few years back, Harold lost his job,

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,800
and we had to give up our membership
at the country club.

49
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200


50
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,500
And then one day, one of my club friends
asked why she hadn't seen me around lately,

51
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,600
and I told her that we couldn't afford it anymore.

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200


53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,400
She waved it off like it was nothing,

54
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,000


55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,100
but I saw her get that look in her eye, that look of pity.

56
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,300


57
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,400
Maybe she was just trying to be nice.

58
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,700


59
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,500
Anyway, is that so bad,

60
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,300
feeling sorry for someone?

61
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,600


62
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, when they say something,
they are being supportive,

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
but when they say nothing,

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,300


65
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,900
it's because they think that you're so
far gone, you're never coming back.

66
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,000
Gotcha.

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Anyway, a couple of months later,

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,300
I started my little hobby,

69
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,600


70
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,700
and the most wonderful thing happened.

71
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,200


72
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,600
This woman's husband became one of my regulars.

73
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:29,900


74
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,300
Wow.

75
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,000


76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,100
Oh.

77
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,700


78
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,900
Would you be a lamb and go out the back?

79
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,700


80
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,900
It's my next appointment.

81
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Sure.

82
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,100


83
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,800
It's the husband of the woman
I was telling you about.

84
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,700


85
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello there.

86
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,500


87
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,800
Hey, Maisy.

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:03:32,600


89
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,800
Episode 10 : Come Back to Me

90
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,600


91
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,800
Every morality play has its cast of characters.

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,300
There is always an innocent victim,

93
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,100
a deceitful villain,

94
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,800
a prosecutor who seeks the truth,

95
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
a magistrate who dispenses justice,

96
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,600
and a lawyer who charges too much.

97
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,700


98
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,600
This morality play was being produced
at the fairview county courthouse.

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,500


100
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,800
Its themes were trust and betrayal.

101
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,500
So  what's your issue with bail
in this case, Ms. Mcready?

102
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,700
We want bail denied, your honor.

103
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,800
The defendant's company imported goods
manufactured by slave labor,

104
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,300
and his business partner Mr. Tanaka
has already fled the country,

105
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,700
and Mr. Solis himself has refused
to surrender his passport.

106
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,800
Dog ate your client's passport, Mr. Hartley?

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
It's been temporarily misplaced, your honor,

108
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,500
but we maintain that Kisho Tanaka set up
and executed the entire operation.

109
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,600
& nbsp;

110
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,200
Mr. Solis is no business partner,
but merely a hired contractor.

111
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,600
And I'd also like to point out that
my client is the sole provider

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,500
for his wife and his mother, who is
hospitalized in a coma as we speak.

113
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,900
Bring me the passport, and Mr. Solis
can visit his mother.

114
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,400
Until then, your client is denied bail and remanded.

115
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,100
What's next?

116
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,400


117
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,900
You better finish those brussels sprouts.

118
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,900
And don't think I can't see them
hidden under your macaroni.

119
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,800
I hate brussels sprouts.

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Yeah, well, brussels sprouts help you grow.

121
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
You don't want to be short your whole life, do you?

122
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Here, look, you know what we'll do?

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,900
We're going to dip them in a little cheese.

124
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,000
Here you go.

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
Good. Yummy. Yummy.

126
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,900
- Ew!
- Yuck!

127
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,400
Fine, fine, be 3'8" the rest of your life.

128
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
See if I care.

129
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,000
Good luck finding girlfriends.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,500


131
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,800
Hey, didn't you have a lunch today?

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,300
I'm going to cancel it.

133
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,900
The boys are in rare form, and you're
still finding your way.

134
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,200
Lynette, it's been two days.

135
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000


136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,300
I don't want to shock them by suddenly disappearing.
You know, deep down, they're very sensitive.

137
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,600


138
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,700
They'll be fine.

139
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Now go.

140
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,200
Get out of here.

141
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,000


142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,600
You have my cell phone number.
You call me if you need anything.

143
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
I will.

144
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,500
Okay.

145
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,600
You boys, come here and give mama a 3-bear hug.

146
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Come on. Whoo!

147
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,300
1, 2, 3. Whoa! Get in, get in.

148
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,900
- Mm, okay.
- Bye.

149
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
- Bye, mom!
- Bye.

150
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,100
Bye!

151
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,400
Okay.

152
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,600


153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,200
Watch your hands.

154
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Um, I'm going to eat upstairs.
I've got a ton of homework.

155
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600


156
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
What are you, storing up for winter?

157
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,100


158
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm just really hungry.

159
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,500
Mm.

160
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, I talked to dad today, and apparently,
he and Brandi might break up.

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh. How awful.

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,500


163
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,800
Mom, you're smiling.

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,100
Am I?

165
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,900


166
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,600
Anyway, because of all the drama,
he can't take me this weekend,

167
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,400
so I'll be home after all. Good night.

168
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,700


169
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,800
Oh, great. Our romantic weekend's off.

170
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600


171
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,800
We could move it to my house.

172
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,100
No.

173
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,200


174
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,100
Why not?

175
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,700


176
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,600
I just -- I just want it to be special.

177
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,400
And it can't be special at my house.

178
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Okay, I know this sounds weird, but I just
need to have my things around me.

179
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800


180
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600
What things?

181
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,700
Perfumes and oils, and I want to pick out the
outfit that you're going to tear off me.

182
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,200
And  plus, I need to be in complete
control of the lighting.

183
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000


184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,700
Okay.

185
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,300
We'll wait till next weekend.

186
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,200
You are just the sweetest guy.

187
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,500


188
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
All right. I can't wait till next weekend.

189
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,600
No, me neither.

190
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,300


191
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,200
What about tomorrow while Julie's at school?
I've got an early job, and that's it.

192
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,400
Oh, no good. My publisher's got me under the gun
for something. What about friday?

193
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,800


194
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,100
I'm repiping a house.

195
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,500
Mm, damn karl.

196
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm not even married to him anymore, and
he's still keeping me from having sex.

197
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,700


198
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,800
I can't hide you in my room forever, and...

199
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
I think we need to tell my mom.

200
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,200


201
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
You can trust her, I promise.

202
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,700


203
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,900
You didn't tell her what I told you, did you?

204
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,700
No. No, no, no. I would never tell anyone that.

205
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,400


206
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,100
What are you doing?

207
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,500
I don't want to cause problems for you.

208
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,300
I'm just -- I'm just going to go.

209
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,500


210
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,700
Zach, stop. Don't go.

211
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,400


212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,300
I won't tell her.

213
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,400


214
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,100
I swear, I'll be out of here soon.

215
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,900


216
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,600
I'll think of something, okay?

217
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:34,900


218
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
H ello.

219
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,500
Why are you up?

220
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,700


221
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,500
I could ask you the same question.

222
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,300


223
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,700
I'm going to bed.

224
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,800


225
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,600
I didn't ask you to wait up for me.

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,500


227
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,600
Remember, I'm here as our children's
father, not your husband.

228
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,100


229
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,300
What are you doing?

230
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,700


231
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,300
Were you with a woman?

232
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,700


233
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,200
Did you tell her that you have a wife,
or does that hinder your pickup style?

234
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
All right.

235
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,400


236
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,600
Even if I was seeing someone, I have every right to.

237
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:10,800


238
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,400
Exploring options is the whole point of being separated.

239
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,600
"Options"? I'm not a mutual fund, Rex.

240
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,300
Oh, that's not --

241
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,100


242
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,900
Bree, you should get out there.

243
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,400
Try and meet someone.

244
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,900


245
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,800
Meet someone.

246
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm raising your children.

247
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,700
I am just trying to move on with my life.

248
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,400
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

249
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Oh, okay. I tell you what, then --

250
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,100
why don't you just call up your mystery
woman and invite her over?

251
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,300
I'll pull out the sofa bed, and
you can take her right there.

252
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,700
Andrew, Danielle, daddy's going to fornicate for us!

253
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,100
Just keep your voice down.

254
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,000


255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,300
Why? Are you feeling ashamed?

256
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:58,300


257
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,800
The next morning started with a banging.

258
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,700


259
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,300
No one knew where Martha Huber was,
and Edie Britt was starting to worry.

260
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,300
Edie didn't like worrying. She felt it gave her wrinkles.

261
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:19,400
So out of concern for her face and Mrs. Huber,
Edie decided to find out what was going on.

262
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,100


263
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,400
Yao lin, listen to me.

264
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,300
It's very important that we find Carlos's passport.

265
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,500
I already looked through his office,
so I need you to search the bedroom.

266
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700


267
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,300
What?

268
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,400


269
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,800
With Mr. Solis in jail, how are you
going to pay me? I have children.

270
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,400


271
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,000
Yao lin, your kids are in their 20s.

272
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,700


273
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,100
If it'll make you shut up...

274
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,300


275
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,100
here.

276
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,500
Three weeks in advance.

277
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,100
If you don't mind, can I call your bank?

278
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Yao lin, don't be stupid.
People don't become poor overnight.

279
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,000


280
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,900
That's my car. Oh, my god.

281
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,100


282
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,600
Hey!

283
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,400


284
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,300
Hey!

285
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,700
What are you doing?

286
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,600
Where are you taking my car?

287
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,100


288
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,400
Government's  impounding it. Here's your receipt.

289
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,800
Call that number if you have any questions.

290
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:31,000


291
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,400
You call this a paint job?

292
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,500


293
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't want to see it again until it's perfect!

294
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,400


295
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,100
Wonder what's going on over there.

296
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,900


297
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,900
I mean, Claire did okay with the kids yesterday,
but that could have been beginner's luck.

298
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,800
You think I should call? I should call.

299
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,500
Lynette, for the first time in years,
you finally have some free time,

300
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,800
and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids.

301
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,900


302
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,800
It's just I don't know this woman. I mean, not really.

303
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,500
So she has a degree in sociology.
Well, big deal. Who doesn't?

304
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,400
My boys are a lot to handle.
What if she's not up to it?

305
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,900


306
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,800
You know, if you really have that many doubts,
you should go buy a hidden camera.

307
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,100


308
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,400
What, a nanny-cam?

309
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
Yeah.

310
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,400
People do terrible things when they
think no one's watching them.

311
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,100
Yeah.

312
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,000
& nbsp;

313
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,200
I don't really think I could videotape Claire.
It would be a breach of trust.

314
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,600


315
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,800
Trust is overrated.

316
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,200


317
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,900
So...how are things with you and Rex?

318
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,900


319
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,300
Fine. Why do you ask?

320
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,800


321
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, I'm just curious. I mean, he moves out,
moves back in. Is he back for good?

322
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,300


323
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,400
Uh, the situation is, um, fluid.

324
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm not certain what his plans are yet.

325
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,500


326
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,100
Huh.

327
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,900


328
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,800
So if you're not sure he's back for good,
why are you ironing his shirts?

329
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,900


330
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,800
Because I have faith that he'll come back

331
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,200


332
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
and that he'll do the right thing.

333
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,000


334
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,800
That's good.

335
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600


336
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
It's good to have faith in people.

337
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Yeah.

338
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,000


339
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,200
But I'd still buy that camera.

340
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:44,600


341
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,000
Hello?

342
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,800
- Mike?
- Yeah?

343
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
My oven's out.

344
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
Mm-hmm.

345
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Come over and help me find my pilot light.

346
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,400


347
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800
<font color=orange>Al green's "here I am (come and take me)"

349
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,700

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,400


358
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
aah!

359
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,200


360
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, candles, candles.

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,200


362
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,400

369
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,200

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,800
Mike, is that you?

371
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,900


372
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,800
I'm up here.

373
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,300


374
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,300
<font color=orange>I can always call you

375
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,200
<font color=orange>for a helpin' hand

376
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,400


377
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,800
<font color=orange>I know you'll do the best you can

378
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
[Come on in...]

379
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000


380
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,200
<font color=orange>but it don't take much from me

381
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,600


382
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,100
Mike?

383
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,000


384
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,300
<font color=orange>Oh, there's love inside me

385
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,200
<font color=orange>I believe there's going to be an explosion

386
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,500
<font color=orange>yeah, yeah, whoo-hoo

387
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,300
<font color=orange>it's tough for me,

388
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,200
<font color=orange>oh, yeah

389
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:55,200


390
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,300
Aah!

391
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,500
Oh, my god.

392
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,100
What the hell?

393
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,800
I'm so sorry. I thought there was someone in the house.

394
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
So you took your clothes off?

395
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,000
No, my clothes were already off.
I was going to seduce you.

396
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,500


397
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,200
It didn't really work.

398
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

399
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,100


400
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,500
Well...

401
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,600


402
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
please don't be mad.

403
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,700


404
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,200
hey there.

405
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,400


406
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,900
Zach.

407
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,800
What are you doing here?

408
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:41,500


409
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Later that day, while Claire was out
getting the boys wired on ice cream,

410
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,300


411
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,400
Lynette did some wiring of her own.

412
00:16:51,400 --> 00:17:31,000


413
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,700
No, you can't do this. You can't send Zach back.

414
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,600
Julie, what else can I do? He can't stay here.

415
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:36,800


416
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,100
His father sent him to a psycho ward.

417
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,600
Actually, they call it a rehabilitation center.

418
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,000


419
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
What do you think?

420
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,700
Paul is his father. He has a right
to know his son's okay.

421
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:50,800


422
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,200
And if he finds out you're hiding him,
you could get in a lot of trouble.

423
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,700


424
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,400
He's right.

425
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,500


426
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,900
Sorry, guys.

427
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,200
Mom, please don't do this.

428
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,900
If you knew what Zach had been through --

429
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,600
Julie, Julie, it's okay. I'll be fine.

430
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,700


431
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll, uh, take him back over so you two can...

432
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,100
listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out --

433
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,800
I'll bring him right back.

434
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,100
Thank you.

435
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:27,100


436
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,400
Young lady, we need to talk about what you did.

437
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,300
I really don't feel like talking to you right now.

438
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:43,000


439
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,200
Uh, listen, Zach...

440
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,700


441
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,100
if things ever get really bad...

442
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,600


443
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,500
it's got my cell number on it.

444
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,000


445
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,500
You give me a call... anytime.

446
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,900


447
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,500
Thanks.

448
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:08,300


449
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,900
Oh, thank god.

450
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:16,500


451
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,400
How did you --

452
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,000
we'll talk later.

453
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,200


454
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Remember, anytime.

455
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:40,400


456
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,300
I heard you moved back home.

457
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,600
Yeah, I-I had to. We -- we had some
problems with Andrew.

458
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,700


459
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,100
I'll move out eventually.

460
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,900
Spikes or pearls?

461
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,300
Your choice.

462
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,600
You know what I think?

463
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,700
Hmm?

464
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
You don't really want to leave her.

465
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,100
Please don't psycho analyze me.

466
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,200
Well, you're still in love with her.

467
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,500
I never said I wasn't.

468
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,300
Then why divorce?

469
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,400
Now you're rooting for us two crazy kids to work it out?

470
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,700
Hey

471
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,500


472
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,800
You know me.

473
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm just a romantic at heart.

474
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,000


475
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,300
Scarves or cuffs?

476
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,100


477
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,000
Up to you.

478
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000


479
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,500
Even if I could find a way to deal with Bree's
whole obsessive-compulsive thing,

480
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,300
it's not the only problem in our marriage.

481
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,400
As you know, I have certain needs.

482
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,300


483
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,400
Boots or stilettos?

484
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,200


485
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,800
Stilettos... please.

486
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,600


487
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,300
Why don't you just tell Bree what you need?

488
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,500


489
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Tell her what you want.

490
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Because she'd say no.

491
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,800
So? I've said no to some things
you've asked me to do.

492
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,400
Yeah, that's different.

493
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,000


494
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,400
I don't care if you reject me.

495
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,000


496
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Rex...

497
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,000
do you trust me on this?

498
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,400
Sometimes when you love somebody,

499
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600


500
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,400
you've just got to make sacrifices for them.

501
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:11,800


502
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
Love or passion --

503
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,600
it's an awful choice to make.

504
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,500
Yes, it is.

505
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,900


506
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,200
Now, I have to warn you --

507
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,000
this might hurt a little bit.

508
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,500


509
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,200
Aah!

510
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,600


511
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,400
How am I supposed to live without a car?

512
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,200


513
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay, Gabrielle, listen. Tanaka's still at large,
and they're going to want Carlos to flip on him,

514
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
so this is their way of playing hardball.

515
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Now, I'm guessing that they're not done yet.

516
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Why?

517
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,600
What else could they take from us?

518
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,200
Pretty much anything.

519
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,800
It's all fair game if they even think
they can trace it to ill-gotten gains.

520
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,300
No, no, no. No, some of this stuff is mine
when I modeled, before I even met Carlos.

521
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,800


522
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,900
See this?

523
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,000
Kosta boda. Bought it when I landed my first cover.

524
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,100
This -- I spent eight hours on a rock
in a bikini for that painting.

525
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
I understand how you feel --

526
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,600
no, you don't understand.

527
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,800
I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things,

528
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,200
and no one is going to take them away from me.

529
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,400
Then I suggest you find yourself a good hiding place.

530
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,300
They can't take what they can't find.

531
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,800


532
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,700
Oh, and if you can scare up that
passport, too, that would be good.

533
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,400


534
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,500
- Oh, hi, Gabrielle.
- Hi.

535
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,700
What have you got there?

536
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,600
My china. I know how you've always loved it, and
I thought you might want to borrow it for a while.

537
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,000


538
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh. Well, that's, um, very thoughtful of you.

539
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,800
Say, um, can I store some odds
and ends in your garage?

540
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,100
Sure. Why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?

541
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,800
Sooner is better than later, right?

542
00:22:49,800 --> 00:23:30,000


543
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,400
Oh.

544
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Oh.

545
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
Mm.

546
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,100
Aah.

547
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,600
Just like...

548
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,500
Come on now.

549
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,800
Yes! Ah.

550
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,000


551
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Rex?

552
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,900


553
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,200
Rex?

554
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,600


555
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,300
Rex?!

556
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,000


557
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,200
I need an ambulance. Right away.

558
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh.

559
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:16,900


560
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,500
Hello?

561
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,600
Yes, this is she.

562
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,800
Yes, he's my husband.

563
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:29,000


564
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,200
Um, excuse me. I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.
Apparently, he had a heart attack.

565
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,100
I'm not sure --

566
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,900
he's being prepped for surgery right now.
If you'd like to wait...

567
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,600
could I at least poke my head in? I'm his wife.

568
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:39,700


569
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,800
You're his wife?

570
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,500
Yes. Why?

571
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,800
I was thinking of a different patient.

572
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Let me get the doctor.

573
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,500


574
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,100
[Rex Van De Kamp]

575
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,600
[Maisy Gibbons]

576
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:08,600


577
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,600
As Claire prepared for bed, she was unaware
that somewhere else in the Scavo house,

578
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,800
the day she had just finished
was starting all over again.

579
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,900


580
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,900
The dog is blue, the doggie is blue

581
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,500
Lynette was relieved to see
that Claire was doing a good job.

582
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:42,100


583
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,600
But after further viewing...

584
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,900
come give me a 3-bear hug.

585
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,400
It dawned on Lynette...

586
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,900


587
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,400
Claire might be doing her job a little too well.

588
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:13,500


589
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Here's the candles I borrowed.

590
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,800


591
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,300
Thanks.

592
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,400


593
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm trying to read, so if you don't mind...

594
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,000
I cannot believe, after everything
you did, you're mad at me.

595
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,800


596
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,000
I told Zach that he could trust you,
and you turned him in.

597
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah, well, someone had to be responsible,
and like it or not,

598
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,800
I've got a birth certificate that says I'm your mother.

599
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,700


600
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,100
Since when?

601
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,400
What is that supposed to mean?

602
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,700
Since dad left, if there's been a mother
around here, it's been me.

603
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,200


604
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,400
Julie.

605
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,600


606
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,400
Do you remember after the divorce that you stayed in bed
for a week and I had to beg you to eat something?

607
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600


608
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,300
Yeah, but --

609
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,800
and for weeks, I had to clean the house,
I had to make sure that the bills were paid.

610
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,900
I even had to schedule my own
doctor's appointment once.

611
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,300
I was in bad shape back then.

612
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,000
It's still going on.

613
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,900
And now that I need some support,
you decide to play the mom card?

614
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,100
I had to send Zach back.

615
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,200
We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.

616
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Yeah, well, now Zach's the one who's in trouble.

617
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,800
You sent him back to a man who hates him.

618
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:24,800


619
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,300
As gabrielle considered the vast emptiness
of her new surroundings,

620
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:36,400
she was surprised to find there was only
one thing she truly missed --

621
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200


622
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,400
her husband.

623
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:47,800


624
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,200
Mrs. Solis, we have a warrant to enter your house

625
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,400
and repossess any goods which we suspect
may have been obtained...illegally.

626
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,800


627
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,700
We're not into clutter.

628
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,300


629
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,300
All right,"harvey the flying turtle." Doesn't this look fun.

630
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,400
Where's Claire?

631
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,100
I gave her the afternoon off.

632
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,200
Who wants to turn pages?

633
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Is she sick?

634
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,500
No, she's fine. I just wanted us all
to spend the day together, you know?

635
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,800
Like we used to. Here we go.

636
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,200
"Once upon a time, there was a young turtle named harvey.

637
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
"Every day, harvey would tell all the other turtles,

638
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,800
"'one day, I'm going to fly off this island
"and go see the world.

639
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,900
'The other turtles laughed
and said,'turtles can't fly.'"

640
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,600
Ooh, it's getting good now, huh?

641
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600


642
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,300
W-what's wrong?

643
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,000
When Claire reads, she does funny voices.

644
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400


645
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,300
Does she, now?

646
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Okay.

647
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,900


648
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,000
"Harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, "so he told them,

649
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,300
'I'll show you. One day I will fly higher than the birds.'"

650
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,600
That's not funny.

651
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:55,700


652
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,100
Yeah? Well, I'm just warming up.

653
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:04,000
"Then bruno, the big, bad turtle, "took harvey up on
the cliff and threw him over, "and he proclaimed,

654
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
"'we'll see if you can fly.
Fly or die, fly or die.'"

655
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,300
When's Claire coming back?

656
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,100


657
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,000
What happened to your nails?

658
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200


659
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh, I -- I moved all our stuff to keep it from the feds.

660
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,100


661
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,900
It kills me that I'm putting you through this.

662
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,900


663
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,500
Hands on the table.

664
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,500


665
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,100
It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong.

666
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,600


667
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,300
I'll take care of everything
until you're back to do it yourself.

668
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,300
And you will be soon.

669
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:44,400


670
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,700
I got to be honest, I didn't know
how you would hold up.

671
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700


672
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,000
I knew you were a strong woman, but I had no idea.

673
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,800


674
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,600
You're a good wife, gabby,

675
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,300
a real partner.

676
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300


677
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,300
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.

678
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,100
I would give up that house full of expensive junk
just to put this behind us

679
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,300
and have you home with me.

680
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,600
That sounds pretty good right now.

681
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,700


682
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,900
I'm going to kiss my husband now.

683
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Hands on the table.

684
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:20,600


685
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,100
There's a false panel on the back wall of my closet.

686
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,800
My passport is there, along with some papers.

687
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,600
Take the passport to the lawyer and burn the papers.

688
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:46,800


689
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,000
Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing?

690
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,900


691
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,600
Just burn... the papers.

692
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:07,900


693
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,100
Hey, Lynette.

694
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,600
Did Martha Huber happen to leave
a spare key to her house with you?

695
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
No.

696
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,800
Oh.

697
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,000
Where is she, by the way? I haven't seen her in days.

698
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,300
Got me.

699
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,400
She kicked me out so fast that I forgot my laptop,

700
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,400
and there's just some stuff on there
that I don't want anyone else to see.

701
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,200


702
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,700
Oh. Well... good luck with that.

703
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,300


704
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,600
You know, you're not looking half bad.

705
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,000


706
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,500
What have you done with that little posse of yours?

707
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,800
They're with the new nanny.

708
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,900
Wow, your own personal nanny? Smell you.

709
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,200


710
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,900
Well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

711
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,000
You know, our mothers were smart.

712
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,300
They didn't get us nannies or put us in day care
because they knew if they did, we'd find out

713
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,000
there are other women out there
who are better mothers than they were.

714
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,300
You know, I had a nanny for a while
growing up -- Mrs. Muntz.

715
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,800
You had a nanny?

716
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,100
Well, actually, she was more like a
court-appointed social worker.

717
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,700
My mom did a little time.

718
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,500
She had a thing for bourbon and shoplifting.

719
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Oh. Sorry.

720
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,500
Oh, Muntz was a hard-ass --no mercy.

721
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,500
In fact, she was such a disciplinarian
that when my mom made parole,

722
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,900
I was actually happy to see her.

723
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,800
Really?

724
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,100


725
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,200
Yeah.

726
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,800
Lesser of two evils.

727
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Huh.

728
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,300
Anyway, I got to find a key.

729
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,600
- See you later.
- Bye.

730
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,800


731
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,200
Thanks for your help with Zach before.

732
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh, it's my pleasure.

733
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,700
I hope he comes out of this okay.

734
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,200
He's a little squirrelly, but seems like a good kid.

735
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,400
Yeah.

736
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400


737
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,000
So how's Julie taking all this?

738
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,500


739
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,600
Not well.

740
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:56,800


741
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,600
She accused me of not being a good mother.

742
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,400
Oh, you're a great mom.

743
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Well, she was sort of right.

744
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,100


745
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,200
After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot.

746
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,900
Seems natural.

747
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,400


748
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,300
And I still kind of do it.

749
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300


750
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,100
I just want somebody to talk to about all
my adult stuff, and she's right there,

751
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,500
and she just acts so mature. I forget she's 13.

752
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:26,700


753
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,200
Well, the good news is that from now on,

754
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,700
if you ever want to talk to somebody
about grown-up stuff, you got me.

755
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,800


756
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,200
Well, I can't talk to you about everything.

757
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,500
Oh.

758
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,300


759
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,300
What if I want to talk about the big crush I have
on the plumber that lives across the street?

760
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,900


761
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,600
Big crush, huh?

762
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,900
Oh, yeah.

763
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,300
Wow, you'd have to tell me more.

764
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,100


765
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,800
Well, um... he's got a smile that's to die for,

766
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,400


767
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,900
and don't get me started on his tattoo.

768
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,500


769
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,200
Thanks.

770
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:23,700


771
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,500
Oh, Bree.

772
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:25,800


773
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,200
What a-a nice surprise.

774
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,700


775
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,600
Would you like to come in?

776
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,800


777
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,200
Well, that depends.

778
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:33,500


779
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,300
Are you having an affair with my husband?

780
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,700


781
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,900
Would you like some more potatoes?

782
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,100
You already asked me that.

783
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,900


784
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,300
Sorry.

785
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,500


786
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,100
I'm so relieved you're safe, I'm, uh...

787
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,700
I'm not thinking straight.

788
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,700
Does that mean you're not going to
send me back to silvercrest?

789
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,900
You've got to understand,

790
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,700
your behavior, the violence,
breaking into the Van De Kamps' --

791
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,500


792
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,300
I just didn't know what you were going through.

793
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,500
You could have asked me.

794
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500


795
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,100
Well...

796
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,500


797
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,900
I've been remembering things...

798
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,800


799
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,300
things from when I was little.

800
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,500


801
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,800
What kind of things?

802
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
Awful things.

803
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,000
Zach, listen to me.

804
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,400


805
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,800
Sometimes it's not good to look back on the past.

806
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,400
But I can't help it.

807
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,100
These images just keep popping into my head.

808
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Well, then, you've got to find a way
to push them back out again.

809
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,400


810
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,700
Okay.

811
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,000


812
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,300
More potatoes?

813
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,000


814
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,100
Yes, please.

815
00:35:53,100 --> 00:36:03,000


816
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,400
Sure is nice to be back to normal.

817
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,400


818
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,100
You should know that Rex still loves you...

819
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,500


820
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,100
very much.

821
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,700


822
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,300
He said that?

823
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,200
Yes.

824
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,900


825
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,500
Then why is he so unhappy?

826
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,300


827
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,000
He has certain needs, and he's afraid
to discuss them with you.

828
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,100


829
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,200
Needs -- like...

830
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,000
sexual needs?

831
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,900
Yes.

832
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,000


833
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And have you fulfilled those needs?

834
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000


835
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,700
I see.

836
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,400


837
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,700
You know, you are pretty brazen for a woman

838
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,600
who just admitted, however tacitly,
that she just slept with my husband.

839
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,100
If I told anyone in this neighborhood,
they would never speak to you again.

840
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,400
You're not going to tell a soul.

841
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,000


842
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,700
Yeah, you may hate me, but you'd hate
the humiliation a lot more.

843
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,900
Oh, I don't hate you, Maisy.

844
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,000


845
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,100
I pity you.

846
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,900


847
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,800
Hi.

848
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,600
Oh, hey, Lynette. Are you heading out now?

849
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,800
Yep.

850
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,400
Um, I'll be home late, so just the usual routine --
a nap for penny, and --

851
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,100
I know, no sugar after 5:00. I got it.

852
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,700
You're the best.

853
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,100


854
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,900
Oh, one more thing.

855
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,700
Since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner,

856
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,800
I'd like you to make sure they
get a vegetable to go with it.

857
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,200


858
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,500
Brussels sprouts?

859
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,300
They're full of iron.

860
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:55,800


861
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,200
Would you make sure they clean their plates?

862
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Not a problem.

863
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,800
I have this little trick I do.
I cover the veggies with some cheese.

864
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,300
Ooh, you sly dog.

865
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:10,300


866
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:18,000
That night, Lynette settled in to watch her personal
pick for feel-good movie of the year.

867
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,500


868
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,300
You guys, you need to eat your brussels sprouts.

869
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,500
Brussels sprouts!

870
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,100
I don't want this!

871
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,600
Hey! Yes, you do!

872
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:29,800


873
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,000
You guys, don't throw them -- hey!

874
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,600
Hey, stop it!

875
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,400
Do not -- ow! Hey! You guys, stop it!

876
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,700
Do not throw these at me, you guys! Cut it out!

878
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,500
Hey.

879
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,200


880
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,000
Hey.

881
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,400


882
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,800
I guess they operated, huh?

883
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,100


884
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,300
They sure did.

885
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,700


886
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,800
How' d it go?

887
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,100


888
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
It went well.

889
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,300


890
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,300
The surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.

891
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,900


892
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,100
You look like you've been crying.

893
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,400
I have.

894
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,800


895
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,500
I was so afraid you were going to die.

896
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,400
There's so many things I haven't had
a chance to tell you.

897
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,100


898
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,400
I'm sorry you were so worried.

899
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,300
It's okay.

900
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,700


901
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,800
How are you now, Rex?

902
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,100
Are you strong enough to listen to
the things I need to tell you?

903
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,500


904
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,100
Sure, hon.

905
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:05,800


906
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,400
I know you still love me.

907
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,500


908
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Maisy told me.

909
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,000


910
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,600
She did?

911
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,300


912
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,800
As of this moment, Rex,

913
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
I am no longer your wife.

914
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:38,200
I am going to go out and find the most vindictive lawyer
can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you.

915
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,700


916
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,000
I am going to take away your money,

917
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,900
your family,

918
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,600
and your dignity.

919
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,000


920
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,700
Do you hear me?

921
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,500
Bree --

922
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,600
and I am so thrilled to know that you still love me,

923
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,800


924
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,200
because I want what's about to happen to you...

925
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200


926
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,000
to hurt as much as is humanly possible.

927
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,300


928
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm so glad you didn't die before
I got a chance to tell you that.

929
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:34,700


930
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,200
Trust is a fragile thing.

931
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200


932
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Bye, guys.

933
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,900
- Bye, mom. Bye, mom.
- Bye, mommy.

934
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,500
Once earned, it affords us tremendous freedom.

935
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,200


936
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,800
But once trust is lost, it can be impossible to recover.

937
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,000

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,200


940
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,500
Of course, the truth is

941
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,500
we never know who we can trust.

942
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:11,500


943
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,600

00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,700


945

And total strangers can come to our rescue.

947
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,400


948
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,900
In the end,

949
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,500
most people decide to trust only themselves.

950
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,200


951
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,400
It really is the simplest way

952
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,500
to keep from getting burned.

953
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:50,500
