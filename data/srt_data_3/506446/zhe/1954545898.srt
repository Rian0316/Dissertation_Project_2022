这里是莫卡伯爵夫人家 谢谢
Countess of Morcar's, thanks.

5
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,960
天呐 她回来了
My God, she's back.

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,800
她下马车了
She's getting out of the carriage.

7
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,120
快 赖德 赶紧的
Come on, Ryder, get a move on.

8
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,000
修好了吧
...look lively.

9
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,880
好了
All right.

10
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,070
动作快点      快点
Get moving.        All right.

11
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,240
伯爵夫人讨厌看到管子工在她家晃悠
Her ladyship won't want workmen under her feet.

12
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
好了 别担心 我修好了
All right, I finished, don't worry,

13
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,200
听你的 我可加紧速度干活
quick job, like you said.

14
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,520
真是美奂绝伦啊
Oh, yeah, yeah, nice, nice.

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,160

Countess, eh?

00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,160
也就约会时戴戴...
Have to get by appointment only...

17
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,600
走吧 伙计
Come on, lad, out.

18
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,600
可以走了
All right.

19
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,120
放一边就行了
Over there will do.

20
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,590
给你们仨的
Here, for the three of you.

21
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,310
谢谢 夫人
Thank you, milady,

22
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,270
祝您圣诞快乐
and a Merry Christmas, milady.

23
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,350
给我叫杯茶 丘萨克
Ring for tea, Cusack.

24
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,950
好的 夫人
Yes, milady.

25
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,510
我得喝杯茶 提提神
I need something to sustain me.

26
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,150
圣诞前夕的准备工作真是折磨人
I do find preparing for Christmas quite an ordeal.

27
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,270
您说得对 夫人
Yes, milady.

28
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,710
之后 再洗个澡
And then, a bath, I think.

29
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,540
夫人
Milady.

30
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,540
蓝宝石
The blue carbuncle,

31
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:01,060
蓝宝石 被偷了
the blue carbuncle, it's stolen.

32
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
把眼睛睁开 看
Open them up, there.

33
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,360
噢 约翰 她会喜欢的 这太美了
Oh, John, she'll love it, it is beautiful.

34
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,680
就像她的妈妈
Just like her mother.

35
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,857
可我们买得起吗?
But can we afford it, though?

36
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:29,500
我告诉过你 我最近赚了点小钱
I told you, I made a nice little bob or two lately.

37
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,940
即使没钱 现在可是圣诞节
Even if I hadn't, it's Christmas.

38
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,380
你真体贴 约翰・霍纳
You're a good man, John Horner.

39
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,800
我真幸运
I'm a lucky man,

40
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,450
妻儿在旁
a wife and kids like I've got,

41
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,530
快活似神仙
means as good as a king.

42
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,100
那买这洋娃娃给女儿
So, it's the doll for the girl,

43
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,340
这船送咱的儿子 你说如何?
and the boat for the boy, right?

44
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,420
就这样吧
Right.

45
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,880
迫不及待销赃了 霍纳?
Spending the loot already, are we, Horner?

46
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,190
什么意思?
What do you mean?

47
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
我什么都没做 你什么意思?
I've done nothing, what do you mean?

48
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
约翰・弗雷德里克・霍纳
John Frederick Horner,

49
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,980
你因盗窃莫卡伯爵夫人
I hereby arrest you on the charge of stealing

50
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,240
名下价值连城的
the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle,

51
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,550
蓝宝石而被捕了
the property of the Countess of Morcar.

52
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,670
你所说的...
Anything you say...

53
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,430
我没偷 我真的没偷
I didn't do it, I tell you, I didn't do it.

54
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,240
有人看到你 旅馆里的人
A man saw you. The man at the hotel

55
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,200
口里描述的就是你
gave a very good description of you.

56
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,888
治安官        不是我偷的 相信我
Constable.        I didn't do it, I tell you,

57
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,910
放我走 真的不是我偷的
let me go, will you, I didn't do it.

58
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,880
噢
Oh.

59
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,520
福尔摩斯先生?
Mr. Holmes?

60
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
福尔摩斯先生?
Mr. Holmes?

61
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,220
彼得森先生 阿伯赛特的看门人...
Mr. Peterson, the commissionaire from Upasit...

62
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,310
他有事找你      别来烦我
...he'd like a word with you.        Oh, please, go away.

63
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,380
噢
Oh.

64
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,100
福尔摩斯先生 抱歉打扰您了
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Holmes.

65
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,970
彼得森 把鹅放下
Peterson, put down your goose,

66
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,247
还有你的帽子
and your, your hat.

67
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,440
你买了只肥鹅
It's a fine purchase,

68
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,850
我就很喜欢圣诞大餐吃肥鹅
I myself favor a goose for Christmas dinner.

69
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,500
可问题也出在这 福尔摩斯先生
Well, that's part of the problem, Mr. Holmes.

70
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,060
这鹅不是我的
the bird is not mine.

71
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,990
您也许会说 是我弄来的
You might say, I come by it.

72
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,880
"献给亨利・贝克太太"
Oh, "for Mrs. Henry Baker,"

73
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,550
显然 这不是你的帽子
and obviously, not your hat.

74
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,370
当然不是 先生
No, sir.

75
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,098
情况特殊
Well, there were peculiar circumstances,

76
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,875
我不知道该如何处理
and I didn't know what to do for the best.

77
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,590
报警有点太小题大作
It hardly seemed a matter for the police.

78
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,250
我便和我太太说了这事
So I talked to the wife about it,

79
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,990
她建议我来找您
and she suggested I come and see you.

80
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,090
你太太很聪明
The wise Mrs. Peterson.

81
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,365
坐下吧 我亲爱的朋友
Sit down, my dear fellow,

82
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:51,665
把特殊情况给我讲讲
and describe these peculiar circumstances to me.

83
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,255
好的 是这样的
Well, sir, it was like this.

84
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,825
昨晚我在归家途中 我刚参加完一个
Last night I was on my way home from a little,

85
00:09:58,825 --> 00:10:01,000
小小的聚会
uh, celebration.

86
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,680
每年的这个时候
Well, at this time of the year

87
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,440
我们几个看门人凑在一起...
some of us commissionairs meet to -

88
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,050
交换下节日祝福      没错
To wish each other the season's greetings.        Exactly.

89
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,440
节日祝福
The season's greetings.

90
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,980
您真厉害 先生
Oh, you're a top, sir.

91
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,400
敬你的健康
Your good health, sir.

92
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,230
正如我之前说的 我在归家途中
Well, as I was saying, I was on my way home

93
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,420
遇到了意外事件
when I came across what you would only describe as a frakel.

94
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,970
喂 你们在干吗?
Oy, what's happening?

95
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,520
嘿 是警察...
Blimey, it's a copper,...

96
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,780
大家快逃 快逃啊
Get out of here. Get out of here.

97
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,980
快逃
Get out of here.

98
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,340
我是在帮你啊 老兄
I'm trying to help you, man.

99
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
流氓都往一个方向跑了
Well, the roughs ran off in one direction,

100
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,200
醉鬼也往相反方向溜了
and the drunk fellow ran off in the other.

101
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,080
我想叫住他 但他显然以为
I tried to stop him, but he no doubt thought

102
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,080
我是个治安官 打算
I was a constable about to apprehend him

103
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
以打破玻璃罪逮捕他
for the breaking of the window.

104
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
所以你就掳获了两样战利品
And so you left with the spoils of victory

105
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,340
这顶破旧的毡帽
in the shape of that battered hat,

106
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,560
和一只上等的圣诞肥鹅
and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.

107
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,480
我迫切希望将它们
Both of which I would willingly

108
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,200
物归原主 福尔摩斯先生
have returned to their rightful owners, Mr. Holmes,

109
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,300
可我不知道该从何下手
but the truth is, I didn't know how.

110
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,460
亲爱的彼得森 我明白你的困境了
My dear Peterson, I do see your problem.

111
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,000
不管怎样 我说了
Anyway, as I say,

112
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
我和太太商量过
I discussed the matter with the good lady,

113
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,700
决定把这两样东西
and we decided that I would bring both

114
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,260
帽子和鹅带到您这 福尔摩斯先生
the goose and the hat to you, Mr. Holmes,

115
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,270
不知道这件小事能否引起
seeing as how even the slightest of problems is of interest

116
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,490
你这一特殊行业人士的兴趣
to you in your particular line of occupation.

117
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,420
但愿我没浪费您的时间 福尔摩斯先生
I hope you don't think I'm wasting your time, Mr. Holmes.

118
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,200
当然没有
Not in the least.

119
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,630
好了 看门人
Now then, Commissionaire,

120
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,990
你自家的鹅买好了吗?      还没呢
have you purchased your own bird?        No, not yet.

121
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,770
那我建议你把这只鹅带回家
Then I suggest that you carry off this goose 

122
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,770
去完成它的最终命运
so that it may fulfill its ultimate destiny,

123
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,150
而我就好好保存失去了圣诞大餐
while I retain the battered hat of the unknown gentleman

124
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,730
的素未谋面的先生的破旧毡帽
who has lost his Christmas dinner.

125
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,220
就听你的 福尔摩斯先生
Well, if you think I should, Mr. Holmes.

126
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,750
那就这样吧
I do, indeed.

127
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,380
尽管天气寒冷 但有迹象表明
For there are signs, in spite of the frost,

128
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,310
该吃掉它了
that this bird should be prepared

129
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,970
没必要再放着了
without unnecessary delay.

130
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,690
那我就不客气了 福尔摩斯先生
Well, if that's all right, Mr. Holmes.

131
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,690
一有进展
I will of course,

132
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,400
我就联系你
keep you in touch with the developments.

133
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,500
好的 先生
Very good, sir.

134
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,250
呃 祝您节日快乐
Oh, uh, may I wish you the complements of the season.

135
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,440
也祝你和你的太太
And to you and your good wife.

136
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,500
你们还是没找到宝石
But you still haven't found the jewel.

137
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,970
是还没 夫人
Not yet, no, milady,

138
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,260
但我们抓到小偷了 就是霍纳
but we do have the man, Horner.

139
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,280
那宝石的线索呢
Or have a clue as to its whereabouts.

140
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,800
我们推断
And I think we may assume 

141
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,420
他有帮凶 也许不止一个
that he had one accomplice, if not more.

142
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,790
什么意思?
Well, what of that?

143
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,740
夫人 和小说的情节恰恰相反
Contrary to popular fiction, milady,

144
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,300
小偷都没什么信誉
there is very little honor amongst thieves,

145
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,700
一看到钱就把信誉抛之脑后
and even less with the right inducement.

146
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,500
钱 你是指悬赏?
Inducement, do you mean a reward?

147
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
呃 没错
Uh, yes.

148
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,100
我为什么要提供赏金?
Why should I offer a reward?

149
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,100
以我的经验 这是相当有效的
In my experience, and it is considerable,

150
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
我发现悬赏
I have found that the offer of a reward

151
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,600
能把那个贪婪的小偷给引出来
would very soon set the greedy cat amongst the criminal pigeon.

152
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,500
是吗?
Well?

153
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,700
如果24小时内
I should be very surprised

154
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,100
没人来领赏 那才叫奇怪呢
if I did not gain a result within 24 hours.

155
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,400
那悬赏多少?
How much?

156
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,900
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

157
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,800
噢 你在啊
Oh, you're up.

158
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,600
莫卡伯爵夫人悬赏1千英镑
The Countess of Morcar is offering a thousand pounds

159
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,900
寻找蓝宝石的下落
for the return of the blue carbuncle.

160
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,500
B区布雷兹特里特巡官
Inspector Bradstreet of B Division

161
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,900
负责此案
is in charge of the case,

162
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
他已经逮捕了约翰・霍纳
and has arrested Mr. John Horner,

163
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,000
36岁 是个水管工
a plumber, age 36,

164
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,000
强烈申辩自己是无辜的
who protested his innocence in the strongest terms.

165
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
由于间接证据确凿
Circumstantial evidence was so strong that the case

166
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,300
此案已移交给巡回审判庭
has been referred to the Assizes.

167
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,700
霍纳在诉讼中情绪激动
Horner, who showed signs of intense emotion

168
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,000
做最后陈述时竟昏了过去
during the proceedings, faded away at the conclusion

169
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
被抬出了法庭
and was carried from the court.

170
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,300
抱歉 你正忙着呢
Oh, excuse me, you are engaged.

171
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,000
打扰到你研究帽子了
I am interrupting your study of that hat.

172
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,600
不 这完全是件毫无价值的东西
No, no, no, the matter is a perfectly trivial one.

173
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
但与它有关的几个问题
But there are points in connection with it

174
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,200
却不是那么无聊
which are not devoid of interest,

175
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,000
甚至还有教益
even of instruction.

176
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,100
我想 这顶帽子看似普通
I suppose that homely as it looks,

177
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,900
实则关系到某件性命攸关的事
that thing has some deadly story linked to it that

178
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,200
就是这条线索能帮你解开某个疑团
is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery

179
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,500
警恶惩奸
and the punishment of some crime.

180
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,400
不不不不
No, no, no, no,

181
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,600
这只是众多离奇小事中的一件罢了
it is just one of those whimsical little instance

182
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,500
400万人口挤在几平方英里的
that will occur when you have four million people

183
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,200
弹丸之地 这种事少不了
jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.

184
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,900
那你从这顶破毡帽上瞧出了什么?
So, what do you gather from that battered old felt?

185
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,200
你素来明白我的方法
You know my methods.

186
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,800
对戴这么特别的毡帽的人的个性
What do you yourself gather as to the individuality

187
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,700
你推测出什么来了吗?
of the man who has worn this particular article?

188
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,600
它是连同一只肥鹅送过来的 华生
It was accompanied by a goose, Watson.

189
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,600
肥鹅的左腿上系着张小卡片 写着
"For Mrs. Henry Baker," was printed upon a small card

190
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,700
"献给亨利・贝克夫人"
attached to the bird's left leg.

191
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,700
除了这缩写
Well, apart from the initials inside,

192
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,000
H.B. 假设是指"亨利・贝克"
H.B., presumably Henry Baker...

193
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
我看不出其他啥信息
...I can see nothing.

194
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
恰恰相反 华生 你什么都能看出来
On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything,

195
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,600
但你没有就所看到的东西作出推论
but you fail to reason for what you see.

196
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,400
你对自己的推论能力太缺乏信心了
You are too timid in drawing your inferences.

197
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,000
那么
Then, pray,

198
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,800
你告诉我你从这帽子上作出了啥推论?
tell me what it is that you can infer from that hat?

199
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,900
这是个学识渊博的人
That the man is highly intellectual

200
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,300
这一眼就能看出
is, of course, obvious.

201
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,800
而且在过去三年里
And also that he was fairly well-to-do

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
生活相当富裕
within the past three years,

203
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
虽然他目前穷困潦倒
although now he has fallen upon evil days.

204
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,500
他过去很有远见 如今已大不如前
He had foresight, but less now than formerly,

205
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,700
精神日渐颓废
pointing to a moral retrogression,

206
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,900
加上家道中落
which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes,

207
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,500
他应该染上了恶习 也许是酗酒吧
seems to indicate an evil influence, probably drink.

208
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,800
恐怕这也是他妻子
This may account also for the fact that his wife

209
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,100
不再爱他的原因
has ceased to love him.

210
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,900
我亲爱的福尔摩斯
My dear, Holmes.

211
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,000
但他仍保有最后的自尊
He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,

212
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,200
他深居简出
and now he leads a sedentary life,

213
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,200
完全缺乏锻炼
is out of training entirely.

214
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,300
是个中年人 头发灰白
He's middle-aged, has grizzled hair

215
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,700
最近几天刚理过发
which he has had cut within the last few days,

216
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,500
头发上还抹了柠檬膏
and which he anoints with lime-cream.

217
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,400
而且他家里绝不可能
It is also highly improbable that he has gas

218
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,800
有煤油灯
laid on in his house.

219
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,200
你肯定在开玩笑
Well, now you are certainly joking.

220
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
根本不是玩笑
Not in the least.

221
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,900
我不怀疑我很迟钝
Well, I have no doubt that I am very stupid.

222
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,700
比方说 你怎么推出他学识渊博?
For example, how do you deduce that the man is intellectual?

223
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,900
这是一个容积的问题
It is a question of cubic capacity.

224
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,600
脑袋那么大的人 脑子里肯定有不少货
A man with so large a head must have something in it.

225
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,100
那家道中落呢?
Well, the decline in his fortunes, then?

226
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,100
这种平沿卷边帽
These flat brims with the curled edges

227
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,200
在三年前很流行
came in three years ago.

228
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,900
华生 这是顶质量上乘的帽子
It is a hat of the very best quality, Watson.

229
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,900
瞧瞧这丝绸的箍带和华贵的衬里
Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.

230
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,400
如果他三年前买得起这么贵的帽子
If this man could afford so expensive a hat

231
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,200
而以后再没添置过新帽子
three years ago, and has had no hat since,

232
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
那么显然他失势潦倒了
then he has assuredly gone down in the world.

233
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,100
他过去有远见如今精神颓废又怎样?
What about the foresight and the moral retrogression?

234
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,500
这就说明他有远见
Ah, here is the foresight,

235
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,400
出售的帽子是不附带松紧带的
these securers are never sold upon hats.

236
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,600
所以这是他订做的
If this man ordered one,

237
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,200
这恰好说明他有远见
it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight,

238
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,400
他用这种方法
since he went out of his way

239
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,700
防止帽子被风刮跑
to take precaution against the wind.

240
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,300
但你看 他把松紧带坏了
But as you see that he has broken the elastic

241
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,300
却不愿花点时间重新订一条
and has not troubled to replace it,

242
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,900
说明他意志消沉
a weakening nature.

243
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,100
嗯
Mmm.

244
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,700
此外还有几点 他是个中年人
The further points, that he is middle-aged,

245
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,400
头发灰白 最近刚理过发
that his hair is grizzled, that it has been cut recently,

246
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,900
头上抹过柠檬膏
and that he anoints it with lime-cream,

247
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
这些都可以从帽子衬里
can all to be gathered by an inspection

248
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,900
下部的检查中推断出来
of the lower part of the lining, Watson.

249
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,200
看这的湿迹 显然 他出汗量很大
Witness the moisture, obviously a free perspirer,

250
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,300
所以不是一个勤于锻炼的人
therefore, not in the best of training.

251
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,600
那他...他的妻子
But his - his wife,

252
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,100
他刚说她不再爱他了
you said she had ceased to love him.

253
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
这帽子几周没刷过了
This hat has not been brushed for weeks.

254
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,500
如果我看到一个男人的帽子
When I see a man

255
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,100
已经积了个把星期的灰尘
with a week's accumulation of dust upon his hat,

256
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,900
而他的妻子却置之不理
and his wife has allowed him to go out in such a state,

257
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,800
我恐怕他已很不幸地
I fear that he has been unfortunate enough

258
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,300
失去他妻子的爱了
to lose his wife's affections.

259
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,100
他也许是单身汉啊
He might be a bachelor.

260
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,700
不是 他想将鹅作为示好礼物送他妻子
Nay, but he brought a goose as a peace offering to his wife.

261
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
别忘了系在鹅腿上的那张卡片
Remember the card attached to the bird's leg.

262
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,800
你总是能找到答案
Yes, well, you have an answer to everything.

263
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,100
慢着
Just a minute, just a minute,

264
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,100
你怎么推断出他家没有煤油灯?
how do you deduce that there is no gas laid on in his house?

265
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,000
一滴烛油
One tallow candle stain,

266
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,500
或两滴烛油 也许是偶然滴到
or even two, might come by chance;

267
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,400
可是 华生 当我看到有不只5滴时
but when I see, Watson, no less than five,

268
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,700
就知道他不可能从煤油灯上沾到烛油
he never got candle stains from a gas jet, Watson.

269
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
满意了吗?
Are you satisfied?

270
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,900
你脑子真灵
Well, it's all very ingenious.

271
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,200
那只鹅 福尔摩斯先生 那只鹅
Mr. Holmes, the goose, the goose, Mr. Holmes.

272
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,500
怎么啦 难道它又活了?
Well, what of it, man, has it come back to life

273
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
扑拉着翅膀从厨房的窗口飞出去了?
and flapped off through the kitchen window?

274
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,100
不 先生 你瞧
No, no sir, no sir, but see,

275
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,900
我妻子在嗉囊里发现了什么
see what the wife found in its crop.

276
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,300
天呐 彼得森 这确实是件秘藏的珍宝
By Jove, Peterson, this is a treasure-trove indeed.

277
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
你知道这是什么吗?
You know what you've got?

278
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,600
一颗钻石 一颗宝石
A diamond, a precious stone.

279
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,000
用它割玻璃像割油泥一样
It cuts glass like it was putty.

280
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,500
这不是一颗平常的宝石
It is more than a precious stone.

281
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,100
而是那颗名贵的宝石
It is the precious stone.

282
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,400
世界旅馆盗窃案
The Hotel Cosmopolitan robbery,

283
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
那颗蓝宝石
the blue carbuncle.

284
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,100
千真万确
The blue carbuncle, indeed.

285
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,700
这绝对是独一无二的珍宝
It is absolutely unique,

286
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,400
它的价值只能大约估计
its value can only be conjectured.

287
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,600
而悬赏的1000英镑报酬
And your reward, Peterson,

288
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
还不到这颗蓝宝石
of 1000 pounds is not within a twentieth

289
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,200
市价的1/20
of its market price.

290
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,900
1000英镑 老天爷呀
A thousand pounds, oh, Lord have mercy.

291
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
你得承认 华生
You must admit, Watson,

292
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,700
我从帽子上推断出来的信息
that my deductions in regard to this hat

293
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,000
其重要性可是陡然大增
have suddenly assumed a more important aspect.

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,500
那是 福尔摩斯
Yes, point taken, Holmes.

295
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,400
我们现在要解决的问题是
Now, the question for us now to solve is to trace

296
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,700
理清从宝石被盗到发现鹅的嗦囊
the sequence of events from a rifled jewel case at one end,

297
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
这期间一系列事件的顺序
to the crop of a goose at the other.

298
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,300
这就是那颗宝石
There is the stone.

299
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
那颗宝石来自那只鹅
The stone came from the goose,

300
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,900
那只鹅来自亨利・贝克先生
the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker,

301
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,200
他戴着顶破毡帽
the gentleman with the shabby hat

302
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,600
还有其他特征
and all the other characteristics.

303
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,100
我们现在要做的是
So, now, we must set ourselves very seriously

304
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
认真找到这位先生
to finding this gentleman,

305
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,300
并且弄清他在这起神秘事件中
and to ascertaining what part he had to play

306
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,000
扮演何种角色
in this little mystery.

307
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,200
兹于古治街拐角
Found at the corner of Goodge Street,

308
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,800
拣到鹅一只和黑毡帽一顶
a goose and a black felt hat.

309
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,500
亨利・贝克先生请于晚六点半
Mr. Henry Baker can have same by applying at 6:30 this evening

310
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,300
到贝克街221B房领回 简单又明了
at 221B, Baker Street, clear and concise.

311
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,700
没错 可他会看到吗?
Yes, very, but will he see it?

312
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,300
当然 他肯定会留意晚报
Well, I'm sure he will keep an eye on the evening papers,

313
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,500
对穷人来说 这损失也算惨重了
for the poor man, the loss was a heavy one.

314
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,900
彼得森 把它送到广告公司
Oh, Peterson, uh, just nip down to the advertising agency

315
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,500
并且刊登在所有的晚报上
and have this put in all the evening papers.

316
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,200
登在哪家报纸上 先生?
Which, one, sir?

317
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,600
《环球报》《星报》《蓓尔美尔报》《圣詹姆斯宫报》
The Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's Bissett, 

318
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
《回声报》《新闻晚报》《标准报》
Echo,Evening News, Standard,

319
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,000
和所有你得想到的报纸
and all the others that may occur to you.

320
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,200
这就去办 先生
Right away, sir.

321
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,100
那宝石怎么办?
And the stone?

322
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,300
这颗宝石我先保存着
I shall keep the stone.

323
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,800
谢谢你 彼得森
Thank you, Peterson.

324
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,600
举手之劳 先生
Yes, sir.

325
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,600
还有 彼得森
Oh, and Peterson,

326
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,600
你回来的路上能帮我买只鹅吗?
uh, would you pick up a goose on your way back?

327
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,000
把钱给他 华生
Give him the money, will you, Watson.

328
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,300
我必须给亨利・贝克先生买一只鹅
We must have something to give Mr. Henry Baker

329
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,100
来代替
to take the place of the one

330
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
你们全家要享用的那只
which your family will very soon be devouring.

331
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,500
好的 谢谢你 先生
Oh, thank you, sir.

332
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
1000英镑?
A thousand pounds?

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
1000英镑
A thousand pounds.

334
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,700
1000英镑 1000英镑
A thousand pounds, a thousand pounds.

335
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,900
你打算怎么处理这颗宝石?
Um, what, uh, will you do with the stone?

336
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,400
我要把它放进我的陈列柜
I shall keep it in my museum.

337
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
霍纳
Well, Horner,

338
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,600
伯爵夫人对我很生气
Her Ladyship is not at all pleased with me.

339
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,500
你虽然被关了起来
You might be under lock and key,

340
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,900
但她更关心宝石的下落
but she'd rather her blue carbuncle was.

341
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,300
我从没拿过宝石 治安官
Never took it Inspector...

342
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,300
这...
Well -

343
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
你把它藏哪了 说
Tell me what you did with it, and, uh,

344
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
也许我可以帮你向法官求情
I'll put in a good word at your trial.

345
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,600
但如果你不识相
But, if you don't -

346
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,700
自从我娶了杰瑞
I've been on the straight for years,

347
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,100
我就一直安分守己
ever since I married Jenny.

348
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,800
如果你不说实话
If you don't,

349
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,100
当法官得知了你的前科
and when the judge hears about your previous conviction,

350
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
恐怕你再也见不到你的娇妻了
you might never see your pretty wife again.

351
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,400
我抓到你了 霍纳 但我更需要宝石
I've got you, Horner, but I need that jewel.

352
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,200
真是颗美仑美奂的宝石
It's a bonny thing,

353
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,200
你看啊 多么光彩照人
just see how it glints and sparkles.

354
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
当然 它又是罪恶的根源
Of course, it is a nucleus and focus of crime,

355
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,000
每颗珍贵的宝石无不如此
every good stone is.

356
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,100
它们是魔鬼得意的诱饵
They are the devil's pet baits.

357
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,300
在更大更古老的宝石上
In the larger and older jewels

358
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,500
每一个切割面都代表着残忍的罪行
every facet may stand for a bloody deed.

359
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,000
它是在华南厦门的河边被发现的
It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China,

360
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,000
它的奇特之处在于 除了它是蓝的
and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle,

361
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,700
它拥有红宝石的一切特征
save that it is blue instead of ruby red.

362
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,500
这颗宝石问世以来不到20年
This stone is not yet twenty years old.

363
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
尽管流传在世不久
In spite of its youth,

364
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,300
但已有一段不堪的历史
it already has a sinister history.

365
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,600
两起谋杀案
There have been two murders,

366
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,800
一起硫酸毁容案 一起自杀事件
a vitriol-throwing, a suicide,

367
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
还有几起抢劫案都归因于
and several robberies brought about for the sake

368
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,500
这颗重四十谷的结晶碳
of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.

369
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,000
谁会想到如此美的饰物竟是
Who would think that so pretty a toy

370
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,200
向绞刑架和监狱输送罪犯的供应商呢?
could be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?

371
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
进来
Come in.

372
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,200
你就是亨利・贝克先生吧?
Mr. Henry Baker, I believe?

373
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,500
请坐近壁炉
Please, draw near the fire.

374
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,900
今天真冷啊 我想你的血液循环
It is a cold night and I observe that your circulation

375
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,300
在夏天一定比在冬天强
is more adapted for summer than for winter.

376
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
快坐下吧
Do sit down.

377
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,500
这是我的好友兼搭档 华生医生
This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.

378
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,700
你好 先生
How do you do, sir?

379
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,900
贝克先生
Mr. Baker...

380
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,800
这是你的帽子吗?
is that your hat?

381
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,000
是的 这的确是我的帽子
Oh, yes, oh, it is undoubtedly my hat.

382
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,000
谢谢你 先生
Thank you, sir.

383
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,700
我想登寻物启事 
I would have advertised its loss but shillings

384
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,300
可我已囊中羞涩 大不如前了
have not been so plentiful with me as they once were.

385
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,600
我以为那些袭击我的流氓
I had no doubt that the gang of roughs

386
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,700
抢走了帽子和鹅
who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.

387
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,800
我想没有必要为拿不回的东西
I did not care to spend more money

388
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
再多花钱了
in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.

389
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,100
当然 这我能理解
Yes, well, of course, that is very understandable.

390
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,800
对了 你的那只鹅
Oh, by the way, about your bird,

391
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,700
我们不得已把它给吃掉了
we were compelled to eat it.

392
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,400
吃掉了
To eat it.

393
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,700
如果不这么做 那鹅就真的不堪食用了
It would have been of little use to anyone had we not done so.

394
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,900
但我们又买了一只鹅 就在餐柜上
But we have another goose upon the sideboard there,

395
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,000
我想它和你那只鹅应该差不多
which I presume will answer your purpose equally well.

396
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,900
重量不相上下
It is about the same weight,

397
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,600
而且十分鲜嫩
and perfectly fresh, as you can see.

398
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,800
噢 那当然了
Oh, yes, most certainly.

399
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,600
当然 我们还留着原来那只鹅的
Of course, we have kept the feathers, legs, crop,

400
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,400
羽毛 腿 嗉囊等等 如果你想要
and so on of your own bird, if you so wish.

401
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,000
作为我的历险纪念品也许有点用处
It might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,

402
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,500
除此之外
but beyond that I can hardly see

403
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,800
我看不出我那鹅的零星碎物
what use the disjectamembra of my old acquaintance

404
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,200
对我有何用处
could possibly be to me.

405
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,600
如果你不介意
Oh, no, sir, with your permission,

406
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,900
我...我想我关心的是
I - I shall confine my attentions

407
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,900
我在你餐柜上看到的那只肥鹅
to the excellent bird which I perceive upon your sideboard.

408
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
我想知道
I would be interested to know

409
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,000
你那只鹅是在哪买的
where the other bird came from.

410
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,400
我对饲养家禽很有兴趣
You see, I am somewhat of a fowl fancier,

411
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,800
我很少见到如此好的肥鹅
and I have seldom seen a better grown bird.

412
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
所以我对你买下鹅
It would be of great interest to me to know

413
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,700
的细节极有兴趣
precisely how it came into your possession.

414
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,800
是俱乐部给我的 先生 一个鹅俱乐部
It was the club, sir, the goose club.

415
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,200
鹅俱乐部? 说得再具体点
The goose club, the exact circumstances?

416
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
我...我不是个富人
I - I am not a rich man,

417
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,900
正如你看到的 先生 我的生活窘迫
as you may see, sir, but I make a humble living,

418
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,800
但也不失尊严 这样说吧
and a respectable one, if I may say so,

419
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,600
我在大英博物馆工作
in the British Museum.

420
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,000
做研究?
Studying?

421
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,300
算是吧
Studying, you might say,

422
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,500
也帮助别人做研究
and helping others with their studies.

423
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,800
我看过很多书
I - I have a certain knowledge of books.

424
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,900
那天 我提早下班
That day, sir, I had finished work early

425
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,200
下午就离开了博物馆
and left the museum in the afternoon.

426
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,800
我办完私事
I had a little business to attend to

427
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,700
就去了阿尔法小酒店
before calling in at the Alpha Public House.

428
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,400
博物馆的好些同事
Several of us who work in the museum

429
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,100
经常去那儿
frequent that establishment,

430
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,900
今年 我们的好店主
and this year our good host,

431
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,800
温迪盖特先生 创办了一个鹅俱乐部
Mr. Windigate, had instigated a goose club,

432
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,600
考虑到每周向俱乐部交纳几便士
by which, on consideration of some few pence each week,

433
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,400
我们在圣诞节都收到一只鹅
we were to receive a bird at Christmas.

434
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,700
给你的 贝克先生
There we are, Mr. Baker,

435
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,600
说好的 一只上等肥鹅
a very fine bird, as promised.

436
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,000
真是难得一见的肥鹅 老板
Magnificent specimen, indeed, landlord, eh.

437
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,200
这下能和你妻子重修旧好了吧?
Put you back in the wife's good books, eh?

438
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,900
恐怕她对我还是有点不满
Well, she is still somewhat irked with me, I'm afraid.

439
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,000
等我又找到能赚钱的工作时
Things may doubtless improve when I am

440
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,600
一切肯定会有好转
once more in gainful employment.

441
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
噢 肯定是学术性的工作
Oh, an academic nature, of course.

442
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,200
我很有前途的
Yeah I have expectations.

443
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,200
这是上次欠你的8便士
Well, I owe you one last payment of eight pennies, eh.

444
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,200
"一夜暴富"了 贝克先生?
Struck it rich, have we, Mr. B?

445
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,000
我碰巧遇到一个
I chanced upon an acquaintance

446
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,500
富有同情心的熟人 其实呢
of sympathetic disposition, I, that is to say,

447
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,200
我卖给他几本我的书
I sold some of my books.

448
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,500
不是你的书吧 贝克先生
Oh, not your books, Mr. Baker.

449
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,500
这也是迫不得已 温迪盖特先生
Needs must, Mr. Windigate,

450
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,400
今年的冬天比以往更窘迫
and at this season of the year more than ever,

451
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
我们不能割舍所爱之物
we must not deprive those we love,

452
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,600
所娶之人更应好好珍惜
or even those to whom we are married.

453
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,300
先把这份示好礼物放一边
And so, if you will set aside this impressive peace offering,

454
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,600
我得缓解下压力
I shall fortify myself for the fray

455
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,400
所以给我来一大杯威士忌
with a large glass of whiskey,

456
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,900
再来一品脱你这最好的啤酒
and a pint of your most excellent beer.

457
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,200
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas to you.

458
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,500
圣诞快乐 贝克先生
Same to you, Mr. Baker.

459
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,100
在我回家的路上
Well, sir, on my way home

460
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,600
我被一群流氓袭击
I was attacked by the gang of roughs,

461
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,200
我以为他们偷了我的鹅
who I believed had stolen the goose.

462
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,000
我的帽子也在扭打中丢了
My hat came off in the scuffle.

463
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,800
我...我就记得
I - I remember little of it,

464
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,600
一个穿制服的警官出现在现场
save that a uniformed officer appeared on the scene

465
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,400
于是我们都逃走了
and we all made off.

466
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,400
这是当然 我们能理解
Yes, of course, we quite understand.

467
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,500
在那种情况下嘛
In the circumstances.

468
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,600
结果好 才是真的好
Well, all is well that ends well.

469
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,200
我对您的费心深表谢意 先生
I am most indebted to you, sir, for your trouble.

470
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,600
我想这顶苏格兰帽
A scottish bonnet, I fear,

471
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
既不符合我的年龄 也不符合我的身份
is fitted neither to my years nor to my dignity.

472
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,200
节日快乐 先生
My complements of the season to you, sir.

473
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,000
你也是啊 先生
And to you, too, sir.

474
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,300
谢谢你
Oh, thank you, sir.

475
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,000
噢 对了
Oh, uh, by the way,

476
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,700
你家有煤油灯吗?
do you have gas laid on in your house?

477
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,200
煤油灯 当然没有
Gas, alas, no.

478
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
很好
Jolly good.

479
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,800
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

480
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,900
也祝您俩圣诞快乐
And to you both, gentlemen.

481
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,300
好了 亨利・贝克先生的事到此结束
Well then, so much for Mr. Henry Baker.

482
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,600
他显然对宝石的事一无所知
He obviously knows nothing of the matter.

483
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,800
哈德森太太
Ah, Mrs. Hudson.

484
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,900
华生 你饿吗?
Watson, do you need nourishment?

485
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
不是很饿
Not particularly.

486
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,300
太好了
Splendid.

487
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,100
哈德森太太 把我们的晚餐改成夜宵吧
Mrs. Hudson, we shall turn dinner into supper,

488
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,200
我们要顺藤摸瓜 趁热打铁
and we will follow up this clue while it is still hot.

489
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,100
能比夜宵还热么?
Which is more than the supper will be.

490
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,800
晚上好 先生们 今晚真是冷啊
Good evening, gentlemen, and a very cold one.

491
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,900
确实是啊 老板
It is, indeed, landlord, it is indeed.

492
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,400
你们想喝什么?
And what shall be your pleasure?

493
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
啤酒 华生?
Beer, Watson?

494
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,300
什么? 噢 好的
What? Oh, yes, splendid.

495
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,400
来两杯你这最好的啤酒
Two of your very best glasses of beer.

496
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,500
稍等 先生
Right away, sir.

497
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,200
如果你的啤酒和你的鹅一样好
Your beer should be excellent

498
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,900
那就是最纯正的啤酒了
if it is as good as your geese.

499
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,300
我的鹅?
What geese?

500
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,700
半小时前 我们刚和
Yes. We were talking, um, half an hour ago

501
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,600
你鹅俱乐部的会员亨利・贝克先生聊过
to a Mr. Henry Baker, a member of your goose club.

502
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,100
这样啊 可那些鹅不是我们的
Yes, but you see, them's not our geese.

503
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
那是谁的?
Whose, then?

504
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,000
我从考文特园一个商贩那
Well, I got the whole two dozen

505
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
买了24只
from a salesman in Covent Garden.

506
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
他叫什么名字?
Who might that be?

507
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,900
布莱肯里奇
Name of Breckinridge,

508
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,500
一个供货商 他那总有好货
a purveyor of the finest quality.

509
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
提醒你 如果你想买只鹅
Mind you, if it's a bird you're after,

510
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,700
我可以立马去找他
I'd get to him as soon as poss.

511
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
你们也知道 现在正是
Oh, it's a very busy time of year,

512
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,600
一年中最忙的时候
as you'll appreciate.

513
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,100
谢谢你的建议
Well, thank you so much for your advice.

514
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,800
能再来杯啤酒吗?
Will you have a glass of beer with us, landlord?

515
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,300
上帝保佑你 先生
Well, God bless you for a gentleman.

516
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,400
现在就去找布莱肯里奇
Now, for Mr. Breckinridge.

517
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,000
非得现在去?
Can't it wait?

518
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
华生 我们正在追踪一条
Watson, we have been given a line of investigation

519
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,400
被警察忽略了的线索
which has been missed by the police,

520
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,600
这条线索机缘巧合落入了我们手中
and which a singular chance has placed in our hands.

521
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,500
我们得顺着线索不惜一切 追查到底
Now, let us follow it out to the bitter end.

522
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,600
真是不惜一切啊
Extremely bitter.

523
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
现在朝南快步前进
Faces to the south, then, and quick, march.

524
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,300
别哭了
Please.

525
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:41,200
我也想相信你 约翰 真的
I want to believe you, John, I do, really,

526
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,000
可我没法反驳警察说的话
but I can't argue with what the police is saying.

527
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,400
但他们只说抓我是因为当天我在那里
But they're only saying that cause I was there on the day.

528
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,800
我只是去做零工
It was an odd job.

529
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,500
真的是这样吗?
Is that really the truth?

530
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,500
结婚时 我答应过你
I promised when I married you,

531
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,300
我永不会对你撒谎
I'd never tell you a lie.

532
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,400
我一直遵守我的诺言 
I kept my promise, always will.

533
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,900
我也想相信你
I want to believe you.

534
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,700
晚上好
Uh, good evening.

535
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,100
晚上好
Good evening.

536
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,400
看来你的鹅都卖光了
Sold out of geese, I see.

537
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,400
没错 明早我可以卖你500只
Yeah, I'll have five hundred in the morning.

538
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,000
太晚了
Too late, I think.

539
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,300
煤油灯亮着的那个摊位上还有
See the stall over there with the gas fire, try him.

540
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,700
但人家介绍我到你这儿来
Yes, but I was recommended to you.

541
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
谁?
Oh, who by?

542
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
阿尔法小酒店的老板
The landlord of the Alpha Public House.

543
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,000
对 他从我这买了24只
Oh, yeah, he had a couple of dozen off me.

544
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,400
那些鹅真不错
Very good geese, too.

545
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,600
我能知道你是从哪弄来的吗?
Where, may I ask, did you get them?

546
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,900
好吧 先生
Here then, mister,

547
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,500
你到底什么意思?
what exactly are you driving at?

548
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,300
有话直说
Come on, let's have it straight, now.

549
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,100
我已经说得很明白
It's straight enough.

550
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,100
我只想知道你卖给阿尔法店的那些鹅
I simply want to know who sold you the geese

551
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,700
是谁供货的
that you supplied to the Alpha.

552
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,500
我不想告诉你 就是这样
Well then, I'm not gonna tell you, so now.

553
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,500
这只是件小事 可我不明白
It really is of no matter, but I fail to see

554
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,000
你为何如此大动肝火
why you should get so warm over a trifle.

555
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,700
大动肝火 你试试被这样纠缠看看
Warm, you'd be as warm if you were as pestered as I am.

556
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,600
我花大价钱买好货
When I pay good money for a good article

557
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,900
这不就完事了吗?
that should be an end of it;

558
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,500
什么 "鹅在哪"
but it's where are the geese,

559
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,900
"你把鹅卖给谁了"
who have you sold them to,

560
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,600
"卖了多少价钱"
how much will you take for them?

561
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,300
好像对这批鹅过分关心
You would think those were the only geese in the world,

562
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,100
就能觉得世上没别的鹅了
the amount of fuss that's made over them.

563
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,900
我保证我和其余来查问的人
Well, I can assure you that I have no connection

564
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,100
没有任何关系
with anybody else who's made inquiries.

565
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,800
查问? 这简直就是审问
Inquiries, it's more like the inquisition.

566
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,200
我不会告诉你的
I'm not telling you.

567
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,300
那打赌只好吹了
Ah, well then, the bet is off.

568
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,300
打什么赌?
What bet?

569
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,100
打什么赌?
What bet?

570
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,300
我永远坚持
Well, I'm always ready to back my opinion

571
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,100
我在家禽问题上的看法
on the matter of fowls,

572
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,700
我和我这位朋友赌5英镑
and I have a fiver with my friend here

573
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,500
说我选的那只鹅是在农村喂大的 对吧?
that the bird that I chose is country bred, right, Watson?

574
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,700
什么? 对对对 有这么回事
What? Oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, absolutely.

575
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,900
那你输了 因为它是在城里喂大的
Ah, you've lost your money then, cause it's town bred.

576
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,400
才不是这样
It is nothing of the kind.

577
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,000
就是这样
I say it is.

578
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,600
我不信
I don't believe you.

579
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,400
钱拿来吧 福尔摩斯
Come on, pay up, Holmes.

580
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,700
你以为我不懂
What, do you think I wouldn't know,

581
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,000
我可是从小就和家禽打交道
me, who's been handling fowl since I was a nipper?

582
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,000
我告诉你吧
I'll tell you,

583
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,500
卖给阿尔法店的鹅全是城里喂大的
all the birds that went to the Alpha were town bred.

584
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,800
你说服不了我
You'll never make me believe that.

585
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,900
拜托 福尔摩斯 愿赌服输
Come on, come on, do the decent, Holmes.

586
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,300
那么你愿意打赌吗?
Will you have a bet, then?

587
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,000
那只是让你输钱罢了
I'll be just taking your money,

588
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,800
但我仍愿意拿一金镑和你赌
but I'll have a sovereign with you,

589
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,700
就是为了教训你的固执己见
just to teach you not to be obstinate.

590
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,400
成交
Done.

591
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,800
那好
Right.

592
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
仔细看看 傲慢先生
Now then, Mr. Cocksure,

593
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,900
这就是我的帐本
you see these here books here, well,

594
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,200
上面记录了卖鹅给我的人的名单
this is a list of all the folk what I buy off.

595
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,000
这一页上的都是乡下人
Now, on this page is all me country folk,

596
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,800
这页用红墨水写的都是城里的供货人
and these on this side in red ink are all me town suppliers.

597
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,900
把第三个人的名字给我念出来
Now you read out that third name down to me.

598
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
奥克肖特太太 布里克斯顿路117号

599
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,100
客户号码249
Yeah, account number 249.

600
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,600
很好 你再看一下总帐
Go on, then, turn it up in the ledger.

601
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,100
奥克肖特太太 鸡蛋和家禽供应商?
Mrs. Oakshott, egg and poultry supplier?

602
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,400
那最后记的那笔帐是什么?
Now, what's the last entry?

603
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,200
24只鹅 收价7先令6便士
Twenty-four geese at seven and six pence,

604
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,400
卖给阿尔法小酒店 温迪盖特
sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha Public House.

605
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,500
你还有什么话可说吗?
So, what are you gonna say now?

606
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,800
这位先生的5英镑呢?
What about this gentleman's fiver?

607
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,200
干得漂亮 福尔摩斯
Well done, Holmes.

608
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,800
今晚就去见奥克肖特太太吗?
Shall we see this Mrs. Oakshott tonight?

609
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,500
怎么又是你 你烦不烦啊
Oh, no, not you again, I've had enough of you.

610
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,600
我都说了 全卖光了
Listen, I've told you before, clear off.

611
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,500
你听我说 有两只灰冠鹅
But the thing is, there were two gray-headed geese.

612
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,700
听着 我被你和你的鹅烦透了
Now, listen, I've had enough of you and those geese.

613
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,900
你们都见鬼去吧
I wish you was all at the devil together.

614
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,600
如果你再用这些蠢话来烦我
If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk

615
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,800
我就放狗咬你
I'll set the dog on you.

616
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,400
听我说 奥克肖特太太告诉我...
Now, look here, Mrs. Oakshott told me -

617
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,900
你把奥克肖特太太带来 我会给她答复
You bring Mrs. Oakshott here, and I'll answer her,

618
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,700
可这与你何干?
but what have you got to do with it, eh?

619
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,000
我的鹅是从你那买的吗?
Did I buy the geese off you?

620
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
没有 可那里面有只鹅是我的
No; but one of them was mine all the same.

621
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,400
那你去找奥克肖特太太要
Well, you go and ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.

622
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,500
她让我来找你
She told me to ask you.

623
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,200
你可以去问普鲁士国王要 反正与我无关
You can ask the King of Prusia, for all I care.

624
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,500
我受够了
I've had enough of this.

625
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,000
快给我滚吧
Go on, get out of it.

626
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,800
省下我们去布里克斯顿的路了
This may save us a trip to Brixton.

627
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,500
抱歉 我刚才无意中
Excuse me, but I could not help overhearing

628
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,000
听到你和那个商贩的谈话
the conversation you had just now with that salesman.

629
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,800
我想这件事我也许能帮到你
I think I can be of assistance to you in this matter.

630
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,700
是吗 你是谁?
Yea, who are you?

631
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,600
我是歇洛克・福尔摩斯
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

632
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,500
我的工作就是知道别人不知道的事
It is my business to know what other people don't know.

633
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
可你不可能知道这件事
But you could know nothing of this.

634
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,500
相反 我知道得一清二楚
On the contrary, I know everything of it.

635
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,600
我知道你想寻找
I know that you are trying to find out

636
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,300
布里克斯顿路的奥克肖特太太
the whereabouts of some geese sold by Mrs. Oakshott,

637
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,000
卖给布莱肯里奇某批鹅的下落
of Brixton Road, to our friend, Mr. Breckinridge, over there.

638
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,000
而布莱肯里奇又将鹅卖给了
Who in turn, sold them to Mr. Windigate,

639
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,900
阿尔法小酒店的温迪盖特先生
of the Alpha Public House.

640
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
先生 你就是我要找的人
Sir, you're the very man I have longed to meet.

641
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,000
我无法表达我对此事有多大的兴趣
I can hardly explain to you my interest in the matter.

642
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,000
那我建议还是在个更舒服的地方
Then I suggest that we carry on this conversation

643
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,300
讨论此事吧
in rather more comfort.

644
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,500
马车
Cab.

645
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,200
进来 坐吧
Come in, take my chair.

646
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,200
我去换拖鞋
I will just put on my slippers.

647
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,200
我想我们得先知道我们有幸
I think we should know the name of the gentleman

648
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,400
为之效劳的人是谁 对吧 华生?
whom we have the pleasure of assisting, don't you, Watson?

649
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,400
约翰・鲁宾逊
John Robinson.

650
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,100
不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no;

651
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,300
我是问你的真名
your real name.

652
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,000
办正事用化名总不方便
It is so awkward doing business with an alias.

653
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
那好吧
Well then, uh,

654
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,300
我的真名是赖德 詹姆斯・赖德
my real name is Ryder, James Ryder.

655
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,300
好的 赖德先生
Yes, Mr. Ryder,

656
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,100
世界旅馆的领班
upper attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.

657
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,500
对
Yes.

658
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,500
你应该很想知道那些鹅
And I suppose you would like to know what happened

659
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,100
的下落 尤其是其中一只
to these geese, or, rather, one goose, in particular,

660
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,200
就是那只白体灰冠的吧?
white, with a gray head?

661
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,000
噢 先生 你能告诉我它的下落吗?
Oh, sir, can you tell me where it went to?

662
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,300
它来过我这
It came here.

663
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,300
你这?
Here?

664
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,500
可惜的是 它已经不在了
Sadly, it is no longer here.

665
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,100
但这只鹅死后下了一个蛋
But it laid an egg after it was dead -

666
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,200
我所见过的最美丽最闪亮的蓝色小蛋
the bonniest, brightest little blue egg you have ever seen.

667
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,200
来 来 我给你看
Come, come, I have it.

668
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,700
游戏结束了 赖德
The game is up, Ryder.

669
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,400
站稳了 当心跌进壁炉里
Bear up, man, you'll be in the fire.

670
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,000
这可怜虫的确很瘦小
And what a wretched little shrimp it is, to be sure,

671
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,900
他再没勇气去犯重罪了
there's enough blood in him for felony.

672
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,000
我已经基本掌握了案件的所有环节
I have almost every link in the chain, Ryder,

673
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,300
你也没什么好告诉我的了
you need tell me very little.

674
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,300
是凯瑟琳・丘萨克唆使我的
Catherine Cusack put me up to it.

675
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,600
她是伯爵夫人的女仆
Her Ladyship's maid.

676
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,900
没错
Exactly.

677
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,500
你从小道消息得知霍纳
You knew from local gossip that Horner

678
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,200
曾经有类似的盗窃行为
had been concerned in some such matter before.

679
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,400
然后你都干了些什么
So what did you do,

680
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,000
你和你的同伙丘萨克在伯爵夫人
you made some small job in milady's room,

681
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,100
的房间里动了点手脚
you and your confederate Cusack.

682
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,600
你设法把霍纳叫去
You then managed that Horner should be sent for.

683
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,000
而你偷了宝石 还报了警
But you, you stole the jewel, then you raised the alarm

684
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
不幸的霍纳锒铛入狱
and had this unfortunate man arrested.

685
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,400
看在上帝的份上 可怜可怜我吧
For God's sake, Mr. Holmes, have mercy.

686
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,500
想想我的爸爸 我的妈妈
Think of my father, think of my mother,

687
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,200
他们会伤心欲绝的
it would break their hearts.

688
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,100
我以前从没干过坏事
I mean, I never went wrong before,

689
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,500
我以后再也不敢了 我可以手按圣经发誓
I never will again. I swear it on a Bible.

690
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,100
别把我送去法庭 福尔摩斯先生
Oh, don't - don't bring me to court, Mr. Holmes.

691
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,100
看在上帝的份上 千万别这么做
For God's sake, don't do that to me.

692
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,100
坐回椅子上
Get back into your chair.

693
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,700
现在倒知道跪地求饶了
It is very well to cringe and crawl now,

694
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,900
那你怎么不可怜可怜
but you thought little of the man that you sent

695
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,900
毫不知情却因你而上被告席的霍纳?
to the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.

696
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,600
我会远走高飞 福尔摩斯先生
I'll fly, Mr. Holmes.

697
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,400
我会离开这个国家
I'll leave the country.

698
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,100
那么对他的指控也就撤销了
Then the charge against him will break down.

699
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,100
这点待会再谈
We'll talk about that later.

700
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,800
现在告诉我 宝石是怎么跑进鹅的肚子里
Now tell me, how came the stone into the goose,

701
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,000
而鹅又怎么会被拿去市场卖的?
and how came the goose into the open market?

702
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,900
告诉我真相
Tell me the truth, now,

703
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,900
这是你保命的唯一希望
for that is your only hope of safety.

704
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,500
我把发生的一切都告诉你
I'll tell it to you just as it happened.

705
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,800
我想最好是带着宝石
I thought it was best to get away with the stone

706
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
立即逃走
as quick as I could,

707
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,100
因为我不知道警察何时会想起
for I didn't know at what moment the police might not take it

708
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,000
去搜查我和我的房间
into their heads to search me and my room.

709
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,200
旅馆里没有一个安全的地方
There was nowhere in the hotel where it would be safe.

710
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,700
我假装受人差遣走出旅馆
So, I went out, as if on some commission,

711
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,600
然后去姐姐家想再作打算
and made for my sister's house to think things over.

712
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,600
怎么了 杰姆 你看上去糟透了
Why, Jim, whatever is it, you look terrible.

713
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,300
我受了点惊吓 麦琪
I had a bit of a turn, Maggie.

714
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,700
旅馆里发生了盗窃案
There's been a robbery at the hotel.

715
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,700
你快进屋
You'd better come in.

716
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,400
我走进她饲养鹅的后院 
I went into the back yard where she kept the geese,

717
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,200
抽着烟 琢磨着该怎么做
smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.

718
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,100
我记得在没想好暂时把石头
I remember that my stomach wasn't gonna stop

719
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,900
藏于何处之前
feeling like a bag of ferrets

720
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,300
我一直心慌意乱
till I found somewhere to hide the stone for a while,

721
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,900
突然 我看见鹅
when suddenly, I looked at the geese,

722
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,499
挤在院子角落里咕咕乱叫
which was hissing and huddling in the corner of the yard.

723
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,700
我姐姐曾告诉我 我可以
My sister had told me that I might have the pick

724
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,300
挑一只鹅作为圣诞礼物
of her geese for a Christmas present.

725
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,300
我挑了一只鹅
I picked out one of the birds,

726
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,300
有灰冠的一只上好肥鹅
a fine thick one with a gray head.

727
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,400
我把宝石塞进它喉咙里
I pushed the stone down its throat

728
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,700
一直塞到手指能够达到的地方
as far as my finger could reach.

729
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,700
我以为所有的麻烦都解决了 这时...
Then I thought all my troubles was over, when...

730
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,600
你抱着那鹅干嘛呢 杰姆?
Whatever are you doing with that bird, Jim?

731
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,800
你说过我可以挑一只当圣诞礼物
Uh, you said I could have one for Christmas,

732
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,900
我在试摸哪一只最肥
so I was just feeling which is the fattest.

733
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,200
我们早把你那只留出来了
We already set yours aside -

734
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,800
我们管它叫"杰姆的鹅"
Jim's bird, we call it.

735
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,400
呃 麦琪 反正哪只对你都一样
Uh, if it's all the same to you, Maggie,

736
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,700
我想要我刚才手上抓着的那只
I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.

737
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,100
可给你留着的那只还要重3磅呢
Well, that one is a good three pounds heavier,

738
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,000
我们可是特地喂肥的
we fattened it up expressly.

739
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,700
没关系
Never mind.

740
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,100
我就要那只 我现在就拿走啦
I'll take the other, and I'll take it now.

741
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,500
随便你
Just as you like.

742
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,800
你要的是哪一只?
Which one is it?

743
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,700
就是中间有灰冠的那只
It's that gray-headed one in the middle.

744
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,700
好吧
Oh, very well.

745
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,500
把它宰了 然后带走吧
Kill it and take it with you.

746
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,800
我照她说的做了 福尔摩斯先生
I did what she said, Mr. Holmes,

747
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,900
我带着鹅去了我朋友家 我们用刀
and I carried the bird to my pal, we got a knife,

748
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,700
将鹅开膛 我的心一下子凉了半截
and we opened it up, my heart turned to water,

749
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,400
嗉囊里根本没有蓝宝石
there was no sign of the stone,

750
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,000
我知道肯定出岔子了
and I knew some terrible mistake must have occurred.

751
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,700
那些鹅都去哪了?
Where have they all gone?

752
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,300
卖给商贩子了啊
To the dealer's.

753
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,800
哪个商贩?
Which dealer's?

754
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,500
考文特园的布莱肯里奇
Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.

755
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,200
告诉我
Tell me, just tell me,

756
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,200
是不是还有一只鹅也是灰冠的?
was there another one which had a gray head?

757
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,400
是啊 一共两只
That's right, two,

758
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,200
连我都分不清它们俩
I could never tell them apart, I couldn't.

759
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,200
怎么了 你怎么那么慌张?
Well, what's the matter, what's all the hurry?

760
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
我竭尽全力飞奔到
I ran as hard as my feet would carry me

761
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,100
布莱肯里奇那
to this man Breckinridge;

762
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,500
可他已经把鹅卖光了
but he had sold the lot, and not one word

763
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,000
还不肯告诉我都卖给谁
would he tell me as to where they had gone.

764
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
我快疯了
I've gone mad.

765
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,100
现在我已经打上"小偷"的烙印了
And now I'm a branded thief,

766
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,000
尽管我没有得到
without ever having touched the wealth

767
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,600
我为此出卖人格的财宝
for which I've sold my character.

768
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,400
上帝宽恕我吧 上帝宽恕我吧
God help me. God help me.

769
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,100
滚出去
Get out.

770
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,600
什么?
What?

771
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,200
愿上帝保佑你 先生
Heavens, bless you, sir.

772
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,200
给我闭嘴
No more words.

773
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,300
滚吧
Get out.

774
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,500
我得承认 福尔摩斯
I must confess, Holmes,

775
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,700
这有点出乎我的意料
to being a little surprised.

776
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:55,400
我还没被请到警局告诉他们所不知道的
I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.

777
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,200
也许我也犯了重罪 但我也可能救了某人
Maybe I am committing a felony, but I may be saving a soul.

778
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,000
如果把他送进监狱 那他终身都是囚犯
Send him to jail now, you make him a jailbird for life.

779
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,800
毕竟 现在正是大赦时节 来
Listen, after all, it is the season for forgiveness, come.

780
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,300
半夜了
Midnight.

781
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,200
圣诞快乐 福尔摩斯
Merry Christmas, Holmes.

782
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,400
圣诞快乐 我亲爱的朋友
And to you, my dear friend.

783
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,100
等等
Just a minute.

784
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,800
福尔摩斯 约翰・霍纳还被关押着
Holmes, I cannot contemplate eating

785
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,900
一想到此事我就没法安心吃饭
while John Horner is still on remand.

786
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,700
你想 布雷兹特里或者他的同事
Do you suppose that Bradstreet or one of his colleagues

787
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,000
也许还在苦苦查案呢?
might still be at their desks?

788
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:05,035
你说得对 华生 我们走
He will. You're quite right, Watson, come, let's go.

789
00:52:47,888 --> 00:52:53,886
