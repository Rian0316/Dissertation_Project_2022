1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,291
I must say, Penny, this is great fun.

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:10,959
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

3
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:13,231
Until I met you,
my trips to the bathroom...

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:16,342
...had been entirely focused
on elimination.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,808
Now they have
a delightful social aspect.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,609
Amy, you must've been in the bathroom
with other women before.

7
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:26,409
Of course I have.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,554
They were strangers
and seemed off-put...

9
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:31,816
...when I engaged
in friendly stall-to-stall chitchat.

10
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,154
Some women don't like to get chummy
when their panties are down.

11
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:39,354
You okay in there, bestie?

12
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,591
I'm fine.

13
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,395
Many people
experience bladder shyness...

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,367
...the inability to pass uri...

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,666
Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.

16
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,900
She always this crabby
when she urinates?

17
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:52,170
We're really not that close.

18
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:55,209
Screw it. I'll go later.

19
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,412
And I'll be right by your side.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,381
Did I tell you Priya invited
me and Howard...

21
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:05,184
...to have dinner with her and Leonard?
- Oh, that's nice.

22
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:07,053
No, it's not.

23
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:08,558
It's a strategic maneuver.

24
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,790
Leonard's new girlfriend is testing
Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group.

25
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,196
That bitch is crafty.

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,935
- You think?
- Of course.

27
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:21,472
How does the cheetah attack
a herd of wildebeests?

28
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:23,370
By going after its weakest member.

29
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,870
Well, what makes me
the weakest member?

30
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:31,711
Your trusting nature
coupled with your teeny-tiny body.

31
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,583
You wouldn't last a minute
on the Serengeti.

32
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:36,822
Okay, Amy, you're being silly.

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,254
I'm not concerned about
who hangs out with who.

34
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:44,090
I don't have a problem with Leonard's
girlfriend who wears too much makeup.

35
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:48,127
Oh, these are cute.
Of course, if I buy them...

36
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,600
...l'll have to rent my womb out
to a gay couple.

37
00:01:53,774 --> 00:01:55,901
I'm gonna tell her we can't make it.

38
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,600
Oh, no. You have to go.

39
00:01:57,778 --> 00:02:01,771
I don't understand.
I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.

40
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:05,150
You are, with hair
that smells like strawberries.

41
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:07,115
We're gonna use that
to our advantage.

42
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:08,618
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,256
By accepting the invitation...

44
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:13,018
...Bernadette becomes a double agent
in the enemy camp.

45
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:15,786
Ferret out Priya's tactics,
identify her weaknesses...

46
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:18,123
...and feed her false information
such as:

47
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:21,358
Leonard's no stranger
to back-alley cockfights.

48
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:24,436
I don't know. I'm not a very good liar.

49
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,596
They kind of whup that out of you
in Catholic school.

50
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:29,765
Don't worry. I'll teach you.

51
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:33,879
I did two years of Cub Scouts
before they found out I was a girl.

52
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:36,849
Okay, I don't know you people.

53
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:38,450
I'm just an innocent woman...

54
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,451
...wondering if this shoe store
will take my Texaco card.

55
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,648
How about concealing
a recording device...

56
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:48,317
...in the cleavage
of your ample bosom?

57
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,962
I don't want anything
in my ample bosom.

58
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:55,162
Come on, Strawberries.
Take one for the team.

59
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:23,327
- Okay, see you later.
- Good news.

60
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:27,991
I finally have a handle on my idea
for three-person chess.

61
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:30,728
That is good news. Bye.

62
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:35,005
Do you know how I solved the
balanced center combat-area problem?

63
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,199
Five words:

64
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:40,176
Transitional quadrilateral
to triangular tessellation.

65
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:43,448
That... That's brilliant.

66
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:45,346
It's what I do.

67
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:47,615
But wait, there's more.

68
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:50,756
I also invented two new chess pieces.

69
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:55,088
The serpent and the old woman.

70
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,598
Okay, now I have to ask.
What do they do?

71
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:01,734
When the serpent slithers
to an opposing player's piece...

72
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:07,238
...that piece is considered poisoned
and will die after two more moves.

73
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:10,733
All right.

74
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:14,472
Unless it gets
to the old woman in time...

75
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:17,378
...in which case she
sucks out the poison...

76
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:21,214
...turning her into the grand empress.

77
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:28,592
A piece combining the power
of the knight, queen and serpent.

78
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:32,427
- Elegant.
- That's because it's simple.

79
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:36,565
I look forward to playing with you.

80
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,761
- And?
- And what?

81
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:43,905
And a third person.
It's three-person chess.

82
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:47,137
I must say, ever since you started
having regular intercourse...

83
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:49,908
...your mind has lost its keen edge.

84
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,175
You should reflect on that.

85
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:56,117
Excuse me, but Einstein had
a pretty busy sex life.

86
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:59,452
Yes, and he never unified gravity
with the other forces.

87
00:05:00,694 --> 00:05:04,425
If he hadn't been such a hound dog,
we'd all have time machines.

88
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:06,931
Got it. Bye.

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,590
You know I'm right.

90
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:13,098
I think he's getting worse.

91
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:16,942
Oh, my metatarsals are barking.

92
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:24,807
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

93
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,953
I'm just breaking in some new shoes.

94
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:28,854
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.

95
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:32,583
Did you know women wear high heels to
make the buttocks and breasts prominent?

96
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:36,124
- Hadn't really thought about it.
- Look.

97
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:43,130
Uh, sure. Very, uh, prominent.

98
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:46,739
Please, Leonard, don't leer,
you have a girlfriend.

99
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:47,964
Sorry.

100
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:50,302
Off to dinner with
Priya, Howard and Bernadette?

101
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:53,640
- Yeah. How did you know?
- Heard it at the mall with my girlfriends...

102
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:56,247
...because, you know,
that's kind of my life now.

103
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:58,841
Have a good night.

104
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:02,011
Try not to ogle my caboose
as I walk away.

105
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,490
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

106
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,194
Hey, Raj. Will you be joining us
for dinner?

107
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,893
The lonely guy
and the two happy couples?

108
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:22,565
I'd rather get a prostate exam from a
leper who walks away with nine fingers.

109
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:26,735
Oh, would you please stop
feeling sorry for yourself?

110
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:30,076
I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.

111
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,844
Just like I'm the only one
who'll have sex with me.

112
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,847
Really? In front of your sister?

113
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:39,749
We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.

114
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:42,859
Excuse me. I'm gonna go
wander the streets alone.

115
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,690
Invisible, unwanted and unloved...

116
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:48,356
...a pathetic shadow
in a city with no heart.

117
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:53,395
I forgot my windbreaker. It's chilly.

118
00:06:56,576 --> 00:07:00,239
I don't understand.
Is this a way to break in new shoes?

119
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:04,372
No. Once these puppies touch the ground,
they're mine and I'll have to wear them...

120
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:08,419
...walking up and down Hollywood
Boulevard in order to pay them off.

121
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,417
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

122
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,251
The wildebeest is in the curry.

123
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:18,394
The what?

124
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:20,590
Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard.

125
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,134
Message received.

126
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:27,103
Commence operation
"Priya, Wouldn't Wanna Be You."

127
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,437
Hey. Seriously?

128
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,408
Didn't you get enough of this
cliquey crap in high school?

129
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,413
I wish. A clique requires friends.
I didn't have any.

130
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:37,940
None?

131
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:40,348
I used to take my lunch
to the maintenance room...

132
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,488
...and eat with the janitor.

133
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:46,113
It was nice until his wife called me
a puta and made me stop.

134
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:53,924
Hang on. It's the wildebeest.

135
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,602
Priya just made a snide comment
about your acting career.

136
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,999
What the hell did she say?

137
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:02,938
She thinks it's cool you're following
your dream no matter what.

138
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:06,439
That bitch!

139
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:10,139
How do you wanna handle it?

140
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:14,218
Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya
that I'm on my way to Prague...

141
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:16,446
...to shoot a movie
with Angelina Jolie.

142
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,514
Got it.

143
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:20,886
Is it gonna be in 3-D?

144
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:23,325
What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.

145
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:26,863
I'm gonna say 3-D. That'll let her know
the studio has faith in it.

146
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:31,299
You're kidding. 3-D?

147
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:35,368
That's what I hear.

148
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,567
Then the studio
must have real faith in it.

149
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,913
Wonder why she didn't tell me.

150
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,345
You been spending time
with your ex-girlfriend?

151
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:46,007
No.

152
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,684
Then why are you surprised
she didn't tell you?

153
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:53,519
Well, it's not as much surprised as...

154
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:57,288
...uh, you know, uh, the other thing.

155
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,029
What other thing?

156
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,667
Well, if you...

157
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:08,004
I don't... Oh, what's the word
I'm looking for?

158
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:12,076
I'm not gonna help you.
This is hilarious. Heh.

159
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:16,008
She's also dating an astronaut.

160
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:19,710
Wow, that's very impressive.

161
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:20,944
Yeah.

162
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,179
But Leonard's impressive too.

163
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:29,559
Thank you.

164
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,554
"Befuddled."

165
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:34,928
The word I was looking for was
"befuddled."

166
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:44,375
Knight to old woman...

167
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:49,547
...six-and-a-third.

168
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:58,617
Brilliant move.

169
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:05,224
Thank you.

170
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,296
Will the two of you excuse me?

171
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:18,635
I need a hug.

172
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:21,470
Sorry, I have company.

173
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,587
Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

174
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,956
I don't want to hug you.

175
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:36,118
I don't want to hug you either.
I was just feeling blue.

176
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:38,560
Blue, as in depressed.

177
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:40,631
Well, not so much depressed
as lonely.

178
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:43,659
I don't know what color lonely is.

179
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,134
- What?
- Red is angry...

180
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:47,568
...yellow is frightened...

181
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,800
...green is jealous
and blue is depressed.

182
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:53,605
Perhaps we can assign
a color to lonely.

183
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,473
Nothing rhymes with orange.
It's probably lonely.

184
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:03,148
All right. Come in. You look
positively orange with loneliness.

185
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:08,155
No, I don't see that catching on at all.

186
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:09,352
What are you doing?

187
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,326
Working on my three-person
chess game.

188
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:12,657
Oh, cool. Can I play?

189
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:18,493
It's three-person chess.

190
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:20,935
- Did you bring a friend?
- No.

191
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:24,304
Then as a mental exercise,
I invite you to figure out...

192
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:28,538
...why the two of us
can't play three-person chess.

193
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,977
Can you believe this guy?

194
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,678
Social protocol does, however...

195
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:39,723
...require me to bring you
a hot beverage in time of need.

196
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:42,520
- No, thank you. I'm fine.
- No, it's not optional.

197
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,195
We're out of tea.
I hope you like bouillon.

198
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,529
I guess you're probably wondering
what's got me down.

199
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:52,364
Actually, I was wondering...

200
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:55,132
...if I could add a third
new chess piece.

201
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:58,209
How do you think people
would feel about Prince Joey...

202
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:02,371
...the king's feeble-minded
but well-meaning cousin?

203
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:06,712
I'm gonna be 30 years old
and I have no one in my life to love me.

204
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:08,410
I can't even talk to a woman...

205
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,056
...without having alcohol in my body.

206
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:13,385
The fun thing about Prince Joey...

207
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,221
...is every time he moves...

208
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:19,024
...there's a 1-in-5 chance
he'll kill himself.

209
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,761
Sheldon, listen to me.

210
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:25,233
I have a big decision to make,
and I'm scared.

211
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:28,272
Yellow. Go ahead.

212
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:31,068
A friend gave me
these new pills they're testing.

213
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:34,213
He says it's the next big thing
for social anxiety disorder.

214
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,473
Fascinating. What's in it?

215
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:40,077
I'm not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker
attached to a molecule...

216
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:43,120
...extracted from the urine of cows.

217
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,257
I like cows.

218
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:46,449
That's not the point.

219
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:49,254
It was its own point. Go on.

220
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:50,521
I'm a scientist.

221
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,961
My ability to think
is my bread and butter.

222
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm afraid if I take this,
I might lose that special...

223
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
...unique something...

224
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:59,969
...that makes me so successful
in my field.

225
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,607
Rajesh, I've had the privilege...

226
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:05,608
...of working alongside you
for many years.

227
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:09,544
My recommendation is that
you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

228
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,547
Okay, I'm still trying to work this out.

229
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:21,489
How did Penny meet an astronaut?

230
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:25,927
I don't know. The regular way
people meet astronauts.

231
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:31,226
- Most of those guys live in Texas.
- Obviously, this one doesn't.

232
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:33,797
Okay.

233
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:38,069
Leonard lives here. Priya's from India.
People meet, Howard. God!

234
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:41,336
- Fine.
- You've met lots of astronauts...

235
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,606
...and I've never grilled you
about that.

236
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:46,411
I'd thank you to extend me
the same courtesy.

237
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:51,282
I'm not grilling you,
I was just curious.

238
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,520
I can't get over the fact
that she got a big movie part.

239
00:13:54,694 --> 00:13:57,527
Not that I care
what my ex-girlfriend's up to...

240
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:59,756
...because I don't.

241
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:03,265
Maybe that's where
she met the astronaut, all right?

242
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:06,803
I'm sorry. What would an astronaut
be doing working on a movie?

243
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,767
He's a consultant.

244
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,578
I thought the movie was about
18th-century Vienna.

245
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,313
He can't have a hobby?

246
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:20,445
Excuse me, I have to pee.

247
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,850
Or is that implausible as well?

248
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,459
It's nice to have
another couple to hang with, isn't it?

249
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,827
All right, guys, you have to go back.
I can't afford you.

250
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:38,436
"No, don't
send us away. We love you."

251
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:44,299
I love you too,
but you cost more than my rent.

252
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:48,113
"But, Penny, you look so good in us."

253
00:14:48,548 --> 00:14:50,812
Damn it, the shoes are right.

254
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:53,884
Good golly, Penny,
your whimsy is boundless.

255
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,052
What do you got for me, wildebeest?

256
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,321
I think they're onto me.

257
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:04,486
The story's starting to fall apart.

258
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:06,427
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be okay.

259
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:08,862
We may have to kill her.

260
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:12,198
Bernadette, I'm putting you
on speakerphone.

261
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,271
- Where are you now?
- In the bathroom.

262
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,898
Oh, look at this, another one
of our classic bathroom gabfests.

263
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:20,673
What's the problem?

264
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:23,543
They're asking me
all sorts of questions I can't answer.

265
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,081
Just change the subject.

266
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:27,412
I could get them back
to talking about Leonard...

267
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,953
...going to India
to meet Priya's parents.

268
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:31,350
What?

269
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,924
They said something
about going there this summer.

270
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,584
- What, are they getting engaged?
- I don't know.

271
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:40,858
I was too busy covering my heinie
on Amy's stupid astronaut story.

272
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,266
What astronaut story?

273
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:45,802
You texted me,
"Penny's dating an astronaut."

274
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:47,030
I texted "architect."

275
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:50,039
That's amusing.
Autocorrect must've changed it.

276
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,977
Yeah, it's hysterical.

277
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:57,045
Look, just forget about the astronaut.

278
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:59,776
Architect. Where would you
have met an astronaut?

279
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:04,087
Just find out
what's up with this trip to India.

280
00:16:04,257 --> 00:16:06,885
- I don't wanna do this anymore.
- Don't you quit on us.

281
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:09,625
Bernie, you okay?

282
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:12,491
It was an architect!

283
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:17,433
Thanks for coming, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

284
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:21,130
I'm glad you think so.
That's what I strive to emulate.

285
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:26,300
Okay, let's see if this drug works.

286
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:35,081
Can I help you?

287
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,629
Forgive me for staring,
but you're very beautiful.

288
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:52,828
Thank you.

289
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,996
That's a great accent.
Where are you from?

290
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:57,802
- India.
- Oh, cool. I've always wanted to go there.

291
00:16:57,977 --> 00:17:00,969
It's a beautiful country. You'd love it.
May I join you?

292
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:04,141
Uh, okay, sure. Why not?

293
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:05,978
My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

294
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:08,244
- This is my friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
- Hi.

295
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:12,380
There's no need to interact with me.
I'm just here to observe.

296
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:14,951
What's he observing?

297
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:19,063
We're scientists. We observe everything.
Here, go buy yourself a scone.

298
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,460
All right.

299
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,494
- And what is your name?
- Angela.

300
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,503
Oh, derived from the word "angel."
Appropriate.

301
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,840
Ha. You're cute.

302
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,738
I'd like to buy a scone.

303
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:34,243
Oh, I'm sorry, we're out.
We have muffins.

304
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:35,573
They sound delicious...

305
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:39,080
...but this money is earmarked
for scones.

306
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:42,413
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just getting comfortable.

307
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:46,582
So how long have
you lived in Los Angeles?

308
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,760
- L...
- They were out of scones.

309
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:51,021
I'm talking to someone.
You're being rude.

310
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:52,687
I'll bet you're an actress.

311
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:56,562
If not, you should be.
You have a very expressive face.

312
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:58,027
Oh, my God!

313
00:17:58,504 --> 00:18:01,701
Wait, where are you going?
We were doing so well.

314
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,900
She never even got to see my penis.

315
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,672
Ta-da!

316
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:18,087
Who wants some more coffee?

317
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:19,690
- Thanks, yeah.
- Sure.

318
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:21,258
Let me help you.

319
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:26,028
Nice to see that the gals
are getting along.

320
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:30,264
"Gals"?
Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

321
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:35,099
- This trip to India sounds fun.
- Yeah, I think it will be.

322
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,610
Are you concerned your parents
might not approve of Leonard?

323
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,939
A little. They're very old-fashioned.

324
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:42,705
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

325
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:46,249
It's not like you guys
are getting engaged, right?

326
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:50,645
Oh, my God, no. We're not there yet.

327
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:54,792
Not engaged. Very interesting.
I have to tinkle.

328
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,791
You've been in there a lot. You okay?

329
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:59,863
Yes. Are you writing a book?

330
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:02,429
Why are you getting upset?

331
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,967
I'm not upset. Maybe you're upset.

332
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,165
What's up with you?

333
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,567
Bernadette?

334
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:14,973
I can't do this anymore!

335
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:19,384
I'm a good girl.
I went to Catholic school.

336
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,488
Okay, well, it's getting late.
This was terrific.

337
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,626
You win. Ha, ha.

338
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,388
Bernie?

339
00:19:32,698 --> 00:19:35,326
I think the word
you're looking for is "befuddled."

340
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:44,440
My catapult flings my bishop...

341
00:19:45,778 --> 00:19:49,145
...to Howard's queen's gorilla two.

342
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:56,354
Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad.

343
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,555
And he comes out at...

344
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,593
...Leonard's queen's bishop
five-and-a-third.

345
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:06,788
Check on Leonard.

346
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,925
Hang on.

347
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:13,663
When is my pawn allowed
to use the golf cart?

348
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,902
When it's done charging.

349
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:17,838
Or you land on the time machine.

350
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,910
Obviously.

351
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,444
Oh, oh...

352
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:27,143
Beekeeper to king 12.

353
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:32,018
I capture your pope
and release the swarm.

354
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:35,684
Checkmate on Sheldon.

355
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:39,698
I knew I should've given my pope
the jet pack.

356
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,964
Hey, I've got winners.
