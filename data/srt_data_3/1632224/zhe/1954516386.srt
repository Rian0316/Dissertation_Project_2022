1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,562
- And now the Kung Pao Chicken.
- Yeah, smooth. Ha, ha.

2
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:15,299
And finally, my Moo Shu Pork.

3
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,744
Whoo-hoo!

4
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:24,350
There you have it, gentlemen.
Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.

5
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:26,509
And it only took 28 minutes.

6
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:31,187
- Impressive, but we must be cautious.
- Why?

7
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:34,422
Today,
it's a Chinese-food-retrieval robot.

8
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:39,225
Tomorrow, it travels back in time
and tries to kill Sarah Connor.

9
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,528
I don't think that's gonna happen,
Sheldon.

10
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:44,432
No one ever does.
That's why it happens.

11
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:47,436
Hey. Is the food here?

12
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:48,965
Ooh, what's that?

13
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:52,407
That, dear lady,
is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand...

14
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,572
...designed for extravehicular repairs
on the International Space Station.

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,913
- Oh, cool.
- Ask me to pass the soy sauce.

16
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,647
Oh, does that come up much
on the Space Station?

17
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:06,058
Mostly with Asian
and Jewish astronauts.

18
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:09,323
- All right, pass the soy sauce.
- Coming up.

19
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:23,299
- So how's work?
- Oh, It's not bad.

20
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:26,310
- Kind of hungry.
- Yeah, we all are.

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,175
Just wait.

22
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:31,283
You realize, Penny, that the technology
that went into this arm...

23
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:35,387
...will one day make unskilled
food servers such as yourself obsolete.

24
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,283
Really? They're gonna make a robot
that spits on your hamburger?

25
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:44,195
I thought you broke up with her.
Why is she here?

26
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:49,094
Okay, here we go.
Passing the soy sauce.

27
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:52,604
Put out your hand.

28
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,710
- That's amazing.
- I wouldn't say "amazing."

29
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:02,779
At best, it's a modest leap forward...

30
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:06,976
...from the basic technology
that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.

31
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:10,453
- Hey, Sheldon? Ahem.
- Yes?

32
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:22,533
- Peace?
- No, not peace. Hang on.

33
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,765
Does NASA know you're using that thing
as a napkin holder?

34
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:56,369
Are you kidding? They still think
it's in a secure locker at JPL.

35
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,798
- You stole it?
- Borrowed.

36
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:03,704
The trick is to carry it out to your car
like you own it.

37
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:06,578
Excuse me.

38
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:13,376
Oh, Amy's at the dry-cleaner's
and she's made a very amusing pun.

39
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:19,651
Ahem. "I don't care for perchloroethylene
and I don't like glycol ether."

40
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:28,692
Get it? She doesn't like glycol ether.

41
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,395
Sounds like "either."

42
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,470
"L-O-L."

43
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:40,971
Who's Amy?

44
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:43,173
- His girlfriend.
- Sheldon has a girlfriend?

45
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,318
- She's not my girlfriend.
- How long?

46
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,385
- Four months.
- She's not my girlfriend.

47
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:50,045
For four months
I have been asking you what's new.

48
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:53,056
You never thought to go with
"Sheldon has a girlfriend"?

49
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,353
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Teh, teh, teh.

50
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:58,430
- How did they meet?
- Raj and I entered Sheldon's information...

51
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:01,829
...on a dating site
and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.

52
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:04,163
Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.

53
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:05,861
Or as we call them, "Shamy."

54
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:10,342
Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.

55
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,070
All right. Everyone, pay attention.

56
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:16,044
Yes, I have a friend named
Amy Farrah Fowler.

57
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:17,410
Yes, she is female.

58
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:22,214
Yes, we communicate on a daily basis,
but no, she is not my girlfriend.

59
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:25,120
Okay, well,
what do you communicate about?

60
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,591
Well, my work in physics,
her work in neurobiology...

61
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:31,959
...and most recently, the possibility
of our having a child together.

62
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:41,738
Thank you.

63
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,609
Wait a minute, a child?
You never see this girl.

64
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,804
You just e-mail and text and Twitter...

65
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,415
...and now you're considering
having a baby?

66
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:52,745
Amy pointed out
that between the two of us...

67
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,116
...our genetic material
has the potential of producing the first...

68
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:59,156
...in a line of intellectually superior
benign overlords...

69
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:02,420
...to guide humanity
to a brighter tomorrow.

70
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:07,158
I'm guessing that future historians
will condemn us...

71
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:10,826
...for not taking this opportunity
to kill Sheldon.

72
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:14,506
- Okay. I have a question.
- Yes, Penny.

73
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,905
You don't even like people touching you.
How are you gonna have sex?

74
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,641
Why on earth would we have sex?

75
00:05:24,017 --> 00:05:26,577
Oh, honey, did your mom
not have the talk with you?

76
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:30,189
You know, when your private parts
started growing?

77
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:33,326
I'm quite aware of the way
humans usually reproduce...

78
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:35,085
...which is messy, unsanitary...

79
00:05:35,262 --> 00:05:37,753
...and based on living next to you
for three years...

80
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:41,628
...involves loud and unnecessary appeals
to a deity.

81
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,235
- Oh, God.
- Yes, exactly.

82
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:51,273
Consequently, if Amy and I choose
to bring new life into this world...

83
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:53,378
...it will be accomplished clinically...

84
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:56,380
...with fertility experts in a lab
with Petri dishes.

85
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,350
Which reminds me, you have broad hips
and a certain corn-fed vigor.

86
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,182
Is your womb available for rental?

87
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:07,656
Still digging the Shamy?

88
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:11,958
Look, Sheldon, before you race off
to the fertility clinic...

89
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:13,429
...you might wanna think about...

90
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,865
...gee, I don't know, maybe actually
spending some time with her.

91
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,834
- You mean dating?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,495
- I can't date Amy.
- Why not?

93
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:22,335
She's not my girlfriend.

94
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:24,500
Don't think of it as dating a girlfriend.

95
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:28,273
Think of it as, uh, getting to know
the future mother of your child.

96
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,415
Oh.

97
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:32,552
I hadn't considered that.

98
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,347
I suppose she will have to have
access to our progeny.

99
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:39,891
And you don't think I can achieve
the required intimacy via text messaging?

100
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,089
- Probably not.
- Hmm.

101
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:47,060
It would appear as if the phone
companies have been lying to me.

102
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:53,336
Penny. Penny. Penny.

103
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,435
You do realize
I stand on the other side of the door...

104
00:06:57,611 --> 00:07:00,171
...waiting for you
to finish knocking three times.

105
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:03,441
I know. I can see the shadow
of your feet under the door.

106
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,377
Yeah. My point is it's a waste of time.

107
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:09,113
If you're looking for an example
of a waste of time...

108
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:12,223
...I would refer you to the conversation
we're having right now.

109
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:15,020
- What do you want?
- I've decided to take your advice...

110
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,720
...and have arranged to go on a date
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

111
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:21,560
- Oh, that's great. Have fun.
- Wait. You have to drive me.

112
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:24,033
- What?
- You know I don't drive.

113
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:25,535
- Well, go ask Leonard.
- I did.

114
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:30,699
He said, and I quote, "Ask Penny.
It was her cockamamie idea."

115
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,641
Leonard said "cockamamie"?

116
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:36,441
Actually, I'm paraphrasing. Having
been raised in a Christian household...

117
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:39,483
...I'm uncomfortable
with the language he used.

118
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:43,114
And to be honest, I'm not
entirely comfortable with "cockamamie."

119
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:45,288
Okay, fine. When's the date?

120
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,891
- Now.
- Now?

121
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,755
Hurry, we're going to be late.

122
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:53,594
Sheldon, did it ever occur to you
that I might have other plans?

123
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:57,066
I'm sorry. Do you have other plans?

124
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:02,307
Well, no, not per se, but...

125
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:08,006
And so this conversation is as pointless
as your door-knocking soliloquy?

126
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:12,380
Let me get my cockamamie keys.

127
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:18,118
Oh, God, that feels so good.

128
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,026
Yeah, that's the spot. Oh, baby.

129
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,327
Howard, dinner's ready!

130
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:32,596
I'll eat later, I'm busy!

131
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:36,473
Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand.

132
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,441
Hmm.

133
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:52,816
- Thank you for driving me.
- You're welcome.

134
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,559
I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops.
Dangerous to drive in flip-flops.

135
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:00,723
- Sheldon.
- Sorry.

136
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:04,495
I just don't wanna be
yet another flip-flop fatality.

137
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:08,534
Can I ask you a question?

138
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,676
Given your
community-college education...

139
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:13,711
...I encourage you to ask me
as many as possible.

140
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:19,641
Yeah, ahem, well, my question is,
and I'm pretty sure I know the answer...

141
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:21,446
...is this your first date?

142
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,648
That depends.

143
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:25,723
Does square dancing with my sister...

144
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:29,589
...at a Teens for Jesus
Fourth of July hoedown count as a date?

145
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:33,259
- No.
- Then this is my first date.

146
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:37,459
Okay, well, then there's a couple of things
you should probably know.

147
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:41,036
I have a master's degree
and two doctorates.

148
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:44,699
The things I should know, I do know.

149
00:09:45,512 --> 00:09:48,572
My point is,
I know more about dating than you...

150
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:52,411
...and if you were as smart as you think
you are, you would listen to me.

151
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,588
If you know so much,
how come I have a date tonight...

152
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:59,247
...and you have nothing better to do
than drive me to it?

153
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:03,695
Fair point.

154
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:09,124
You know, there's something I've
always wondered about Aquaman.

155
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,230
- Yeah?
- Where does he poop?

156
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:18,210
- What?
- What would a toilet look like in Atlantis?

157
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:21,211
How would you flush it?
And when you did flush it...

158
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:23,281
...where would the poop go?

159
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:28,614
Hold that thought.

160
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,716
Hey, Howard, what's going on?

161
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:35,787
Wha...? Hold on. Howard.
Howard, slow down.

162
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:38,430
The robot hand
is stuck on your what?

163
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,534
You're not gonna believe this.

164
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,152
So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me
you're a neuro-something-or-other.

165
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,090
Neurobiologist.

166
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:10,855
Your "check engine" light is on.

167
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,692
Yeah, it's okay.

168
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:16,028
- But the light indicates...
- Don't bother.

169
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:20,935
I've wasted many an hour
tilting at that particular windmill.

170
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,569
What is that scent you're wearing?
It smells great.

171
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:27,807
Dandruff shampoo.

172
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:31,812
I have dry scalp.

173
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:35,148
Ah, well, your hair looks very nice.

174
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,188
Are you a homosexual?

175
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:43,618
- No, I was just giving you a compliment.
- Hmm.

176
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:46,731
I would have been more flattered
if you were a homosexual.

177
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:52,629
- Guys, how about some music?
- Oh, I wouldn't care for that.

178
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,466
- Amy?
- No, thank you.

179
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:59,142
Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is.

180
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,183
Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy...

181
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,717
...what it was like for you
growing up in Texas?

182
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:09,411
No.

183
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,151
Well, why don't you tell her?

184
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,652
All right.

185
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,624
It was hell.

186
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:20,826
Any follow-up, Amy?

187
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:23,762
No.

188
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,371
I, myself, grew up in Nebraska.
Small town outside of Omaha.

189
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:37,676
Yeah, nice place, mostly family farms,
a few meth labs.

190
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,047
I'm sorry, how is this better
than uncomfortable silence?

191
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,518
I don't know.
I was just trying something.

192
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:47,456
Muggles.

193
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:57,267
You slipped and fell into a robot hand?

194
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,034
Yes.

195
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:03,699
Penis first.

196
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,077
Yes. Now, help me!

197
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,476
I'd suggest a lubricant...

198
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:14,084
...but I have a feeling
you fell on some of that as well.

199
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,481
Not funny, Leonard.

200
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:18,486
Really? A robot hand's
got a death grip on your junk, dude.

201
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:19,682
That's funny, ask anyone.

202
00:13:21,394 --> 00:13:24,090
Please, before my mother walks in,
get this off me.

203
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,287
Okay, let's see.

204
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,092
No. Don't touch.
The program is paused.

205
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,757
- Then let's unpause it.
- I loaded the wrong program.

206
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:31,961
The hand thinks
it's holding a screwdriver.

207
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:35,073
If you continue the program,
it's gonna start twisting.

208
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:39,400
All... All... All right, how about this?

209
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:43,572
When Winnie the Pooh
got his head stuck in the honey tree...

210
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,413
...his friends all grabbed onto him
and pulled and pulled.

211
00:13:49,722 --> 00:13:53,180
You do what you want. I'm not touching
another man's honey tree.

212
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,418
All right, uh, forget pulling.

213
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:58,029
How about we get an electric saw
and cut it off?

214
00:13:58,231 --> 00:13:59,823
What? No saws!

215
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,934
One circumcision was enough.

216
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,166
How about an acetylene torch?

217
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,637
I can't believe
this needs to be said out loud.

218
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:13,643
- No pulling, no saws, no torches.
- Then what do you want us to do?

219
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,906
Howard, I made cookies for you...

220
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:18,346
...and your little friends!

221
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,547
That's great, Mom, thanks!

222
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:23,483
I'll bring them up with Hawaiian Punch!

223
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,624
- Don't come up here!
- Why not?

224
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,817
Are you ashamed of your mother?

225
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:30,554
Yes, but that's not the point!

226
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,622
Get me out of here.

227
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,699
You have any ideas, Raj?

228
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:38,564
Right now, all I can think about
is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

229
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:49,080
Hey, here's another possible topic
of conversation.

230
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:50,806
This is a big night for Sheldon.

231
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:55,584
- Right, Sheldon?
- Big night?

232
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:58,086
The winter solstice is a big night.

233
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:01,591
It's over 14 hours
in Southern California.

234
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:07,197
- That's an amusing factoid.
- Thank you.

235
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:14,038
No, no. My point is, uh,
tonight is Sheldon's first official date.

236
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:15,799
Discuss.

237
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:19,334
- Is this true?
- Apparently a semi-incestuous...

238
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:22,504
...Teens for Jesus
Fourth of July hoedown didn't count.

239
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,079
So, um, Amy, what about you?
Do you date much?

240
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,585
Once a year.
It's a deal I made with my mother...

241
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:31,620
...in exchange for her silence
on the matter...

242
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:36,694
...and the use of her George Foreman Grill
that seals in the flavor without the fat.

243
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:41,062
What about you?
Do you go on many dates?

244
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:44,027
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many. A few.

245
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:49,196
What's?

246
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,569
Your characterization of approximately
171 different men as a few.

247
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,408
What...?

248
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:59,440
Where did you get 171 men?

249
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:00,950
Simple extrapolation.

250
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,317
In the three years that I've known you,
you were single for two.

251
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,288
During that time,
I saw 17 different suitors.

252
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,586
If we work backwards...

253
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:12,959
...correcting for observation bias
and postulate an initial dating age of 15...

254
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:16,659
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
I did not start dating at 15.

255
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,962
- I'm sorry. Sixteen?
- Fourteen.

256
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:21,898
My mistake.

257
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:25,407
Now assuming the left side of a bell curve
peaking around the present...

258
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:31,483
...that would bring the total
up to 193 men, plus or minus eight men.

259
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:37,020
Remarkable. Did you have
sexual intercourse with all of these men?

260
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,418
- No.
- No.

261
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:41,526
Although that number
would be fairly easy to calculate.

262
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:43,855
Based on the number
of awkward encounters I've had...

263
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,861
...with strange men
leaving her apartment...

264
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:48,432
...plus the number of times
she's returned home...

265
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:50,933
...wearing same clothes
she wore the night before...

266
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:54,504
- I think you've made your point.
- So we multiply a 193...

267
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:57,199
...minus 21 men
before the loss of virginity...

268
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:03,906
...so 172 times 0.18
gives us 30.96 sexual partners.

269
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:06,683
Let's round that up to 31.

270
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:10,485
Okay, Sheldon. You are so wrong.

271
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,647
That is not even close
to the real number.

272
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,123
I'm gonna need a drink over here.

273
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:18,491
This is very interesting.
Cultural perceptions are subjective.

274
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,825
Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?

275
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:25,227
No. No.

276
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,535
No.

277
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,532
Let's just all finish our dinners,
okay?

278
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,507
This is an interesting topic.

279
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,044
How many sexual encounters
have you had?

280
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:38,513
Does volunteering for an experiment
in which orgasm was achieved...

281
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:42,381
...by electronically stimulating
the pleasure centers of the brain count?

282
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:45,324
I should think so.

283
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:47,356
Then 128.

284
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:58,102
Okay, come on.

285
00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:00,605
Almost there.

286
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:07,668
Don't tug. No tugging.

287
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:09,508
Next time take your own advice.

288
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:13,545
Excuse me. Could you help us out?

289
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,688
My, my, my.
What do we have here?

290
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,693
- I slipped and fell.
- Yeah, we get that a lot.

291
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:26,694
- What is this?
- It's a robot arm.

292
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:29,231
Where's the rest of the robot?

293
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:31,431
I only built the arm.

294
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:34,004
Because that's all you needed, right?

295
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,035
Can you please just help me?

296
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:42,208
All right. All right.
Hang on, stay calm.

297
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:44,744
I need an orderly with a wheelchair.

298
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,546
I've got a robot hand
grasping a man's penis out here.

299
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:52,314
You think you could be
a little more discreet?

300
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:55,961
I'm sorry, we don't have a code
for robot hand grasping a man's penis.

301
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:58,924
Why is it hooked up to a computer?

302
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:01,464
- It's what controls the arm.
- But it's frozen.

303
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:04,296
Did you try turning it off
and back on again?

304
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,131
No, you see,
it's more complicated than that...

305
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:09,035
No, wait!

306
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:19,175
Winnie the Pooh
is out of the honey tree.

307
00:19:20,753 --> 00:19:23,187
Now can we have cookies
and Hawaiian Punch?

308
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,991
You were right.
This was a very productive evening.

309
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:36,123
I saw a whole new side
of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

310
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:39,601
I did not have sex with 31 guys.

311
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:44,506
I'll be happy to check the math,
but numbers don't lie, Penny.

312
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:49,542
In any event, now that Amy and I
have spent quality time together...

313
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:53,651
...I feel much more confident proceeding
to the next stage of our relationship.

314
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:54,843
And that is?

315
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,818
Using in vitro fertilization
and a surrogate uterus...

316
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,289
...to gift humanity with our progeny.

317
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,488
You're still on that?

318
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:08,565
In these uncertain times,
doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

319
00:20:09,568 --> 00:20:13,163
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
come at this in a whole new way.

320
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:16,399
Sheldon, if you try to make a baby
with Amy in a Petri dish...

321
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:18,566
...I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

322
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:20,336
Well, that's no threat.

323
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:22,413
My mother's
always wanted a grandchild.

324
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:25,573
Really? Your deeply religious,
born-again Christian mother...

325
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:29,050
...wants a test-tube grandbaby
born out of wedlock?

326
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:33,850
Curses.

327
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:38,486
If I'd thought of that in the first place,
I could've saved myself this whole night.

328
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:42,896
Well, it's not that late. You could
still go out and look for number 32.

329
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:48,899
Good night.

330
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:51,008
Hey, Howard. What's up?

331
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:54,874
- I've decided not to procreate.
- Yeah, yeah, great.

332
00:20:56,115 --> 00:21:00,074
Howard, uh, slow down.
What do you mean, "It happened again"?
