1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,477
Mr Magnussen, please state your
full name for the record.

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:08,137
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:10,139
Mr Magnussen,

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,474
how would you describe your
influence over the Prime Minister?

5
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:14,912
The British Prime Minister?

6
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:17,752
Any of the British Prime Ministers
you have known.

7
00:00:17,753 --> 00:00:20,961
I never had the slightest
influence over any of them.

8
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:22,463
Why would I?

9
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:29,653
I notice you've had seven meetings
at Downing Street this year.

10
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:31,480
Why?

11
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:34,121
Because I was invited.

12
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,964
Can you recall the subjects
under discussion?

13
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:40,700
Not without being more indiscreet
than I believe is appropriate.

14
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:43,219
Do you think it right that
a newspaper proprietor,

15
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:47,036
a private individual,
and in fact a foreign national,

16
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:50,611
should have such regular access
to our Prime Minister?

17
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:55,999
I don't think it's wrong that
a private individual should

18
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:57,783
accept an invitation.

19
00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:01,330
However, you have my sincere
apologies for being foreign.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,402
That's not what I meant. That is
not in any way...

21
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:06,516
Mr Magnussen,
can you recall an occasion

22
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:10,066
when your remarks could have
influenced government policy?

23
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,740
Or the Prime Minister's
thinking in any way?

24
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:15,612
No.

25
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:16,808
Are you sure?

26
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,252
I have an excellent memory.

27
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,017
Your car is waiting outside...
See you tomorrow.

28
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:57,586
May I join you?

29
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:59,621
I don't think it's appropriate.

30
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:03,488
It isn't. Mr Magnussen, outside the
inquiry, we can have no contact,

31
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,937
no communication at all.

32
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:08,279
Please don't do that.

33
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,354
In 1982, your husband corresponded
with Helen Catherine Driscoll.

34
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:14,763
That was before I knew him.

35
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:17,341
The letters were lively, loving...

36
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:19,314
some would say explicit.

37
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:21,489
And currently in my possession.

38
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,422
Will you please move your hand?

39
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:28,375
"I long, my darling, to know
the touch of your... body."

40
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,389
I know what was in the letters.

41
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,839
She was 15.

42
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,584
She looked older.

43
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:41,384
Oh, she looked delicious.
We have photographs too.

44
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,035
The ones she sent him.

45
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,894
Yum-yum.

46
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,867
He was unaware of her age.

47
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:50,042
He met her only
once before the letters began.

48
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,941
When he discovered the truth,
he stopped immediately.

49
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,673
Those are the facts.

50
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:57,452
Facts are for history books.
I work in news.

51
00:03:57,452 --> 00:03:59,143
Your hand is sweating.

52
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:01,922
Always, I'm afraid.
I have a condition.

53
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,251
It's disgusting.

54
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,030
I'm used to it.

55
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,130
The whole world is wet to my touch.

56
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:12,030
I will call someone,
I will have you removed.

57
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:13,440
What is that?

58
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:20,125
Claire de la Lune?

59
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,985
A bit young for you, isn't it?

60
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:28,582
You want to hit me now?
Could you, still?

61
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,435
Little old lady now.

62
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,221
Perhaps you should
settle for calling someone.

63
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,336
Well, go on.

64
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:40,745
No?

65
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,898
Because now there are consequences.

66
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,290
I have the letters
and therefore I have you.

67
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,964
This is blackmail.

68
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:48,519
Of course it isn't blackmail.

69
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,832
This is...

70
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,988
ownership.

71
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,021
You do not own me.

72
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,175
Claire de la Lune.

73
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:15,590
It never tastes like it smells,
does it?

74
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:25,119
Lady Smallwood's bill is on me.
See to it.

75
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,514
Yes, Mr Magnussen.

76
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,677
Oh, God! Oh!

77
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,269
You all right, ma'am?

78
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:41,385
Fine, yes.

79
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:44,175
Magnussen!

80
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,125
No-one stands up to him.

81
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,438
No-one dares, no-one even tries.

82
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,468
There isn't a man or woman
in England capable of stopping

83
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,063
that disgusting creature...

84
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,288
Ma'am?

85
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,757
Turn the car around. We're going
back into town. Turn around.

86
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,188
Where are we going, ma'am?

87
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:07,343
Baker Street.

88
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:49,372
'You've seen a lot of injuries,
then? Violent deaths?'

89
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:51,766
'Enough for a lifetime.'
'Want to see some more?'

90
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,323
'Oh, God, yes.'

91
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,397
'The game is on.'

92
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:05,137
I know it's early.
Really, I'm sorry.

93
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:09,209
Is that Kate?
Yeah, it's Kate.

94
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,338
Invite her in?

95
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:13,062
Er, sorry, yes,
do you want to come in, Kate?

96
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:17,114
Hey!

97
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:18,387
It's hard.

98
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:23,907
There you go. It's Isaac.
Oh, your husband? Son. Son, yeah.

99
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:27,305
He's gone missing again.
Didn't come home last night.

100
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:28,502
The usual.

101
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:30,316
He's the drugs one, yeah?

102
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,362
Er, yeah, nicely put, John.

103
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:35,219
But is it Sherlock Holmes you want?
Because I've not seen him in ages.

104
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,226
About a month.
Who is Sherlock Holmes?

105
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:38,886
See, that does happen.

106
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:43,394
There's a place they all go to,
him and his friends.

107
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,340
They all do whatever they do.

108
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,650
Shoot up, whatever you call it.

109
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,359
Where is he? It's a house, it's a
dump. It's practically falling down.

110
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,471
No, the address? Where, exactly?

111
00:07:58,471 --> 00:07:59,867
Seriously? Why not?

112
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:02,220
She's not going to the police,
someone's got to get him.

113
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,453
Why you? I'm being neighbourly.
Since when?

114
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:07,086
Ha, since now.
Since this exact minute.

115
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,599
Why are you being so...? What?

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,394
I don't know,
what's the matter with you?

117
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:13,384
There is NOTHING the matter with me.

118
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:16,169
Imagine I said that without
shouting. I'm trying.

119
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:18,158
No, you can't come, you're pregnant.

120
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:19,749
You can't go, I'm pregnant!

121
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,810
What is that?!

122
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,913
It's a tyre lever. Why? Cos there
were loads of smackheads in there

123
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,902
and one of them
might need help with a tyre.

124
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:38,409
If there's any trouble,
just go, I'll be fine.

125
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,199
John, John, John, John...

126
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:43,283
It is a tiny bit sexy.

127
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:44,770
Yeah, I know.

128
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:49,273
Hello?

129
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,096
What do you want? Excuse me.

130
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,920
Oh, no, you can't come in here!

131
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:03,463
I'm looking for a friend.
A very specific... friend.

132
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:04,990
I'm not just browsing.

133
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:08,448
You've got to go.
No-one's allowed here.

134
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,302
Isaac Whitney, you seen him?

135
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:14,156
I'm asking you
if you've seen Isaac Whitney

136
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,603
and now you're showing me a knife.

137
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:19,019
Is it a clue? Are you doing a mime?

138
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,075
Go. Or I'll cut you.

139
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,607
Oh, not from there. Let me help.

140
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,281
Now, concentrate. Isaac... Whitney?

141
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,768
OK, you asked for it.

142
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,637
Agh! Ohh!

143
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:41,531
Right. Are you concentrating yet?

144
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:43,099
You broke my arm!

145
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,425
No, I sprained it.

146
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:48,124
It feels squishy.
Is it supposed to feel squishy?

147
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:50,214
Feel that! Yeah, it's a sprain.

148
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,224
I'm a doctor,
I know how to sprain people.

149
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,355
Now where is Isaac Whitney?

150
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:57,490
I don't know! Maybe upstairs.

151
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,742
There you go. Wasn't that easy?

152
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,239
No, it was really sore.

153
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,766
Mental, you are!

154
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:07,540
No, just used to a better
class of criminal.

155
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,932
Isaac? Isaac Whitney?

156
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,308
Isaac?

157
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:31,498
Hello, mate. Sit up for me, sit up.

158
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,197
Dr Watson? Yep.

159
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:36,636
Where am I?

160
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,274
Arse-end of the universe with
the scum of the earth. Look at me.

161
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,673
Have you come for me?

162
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,351
Do you think
I know a lot of people here?

163
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,709
Hey, all right?

164
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:51,105
Oh, hello, John.
Didn't expect to see you here.

165
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:55,862
Come for me too?

166
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:02,137
Hello, Isaac. Mrs Watson,
can I, can I get in, please?

167
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:05,175
Yes, of course, get in. Where's
John? They're having a fight.

168
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:06,574
Who is?!

169
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:09,093
For God sakes, John, I'm on a case!

170
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,531
A month. That's all it took.

171
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:12,370
One! I'm working.

172
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,888
"Sherlock Holmes in a drug den."
How's that going to look?!

173
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:16,806
I'm undercover. No, you're not!

174
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:19,045
Well, I'm not now!

175
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,443
In, both of you, quickly!

176
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,237
Please, can I come?
I think I've got a broken arm.

177
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:33,754
No, go away. No, let him. Why?
Yeah, just get in. It's a sprain.

178
00:11:34,914 --> 00:11:38,191
Anyone else? I mean, are we taking
everybody home, are we?

179
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,948
All right, Shezza?

180
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,107
"Shezza"? I WAS undercover!

181
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:44,626
Seriously, Shezza, though?

182
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:47,584
We're not going home, we're going to
Bart's. I'm calling Molly. Why?

183
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:50,781
Because Sherlock Holmes needs
to pee in a jar.

184
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:04,212
Well? Is he clean?

185
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:06,495
Clean?

186
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:18,732
How dare you throw away the
beautiful gifts you were born with!

187
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,858
And how dare you betray
the love of your friends!

188
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,141
Say you're sorry.

189
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,592
Sorry your engagement's over. Though I'm
fairly grateful for the lack of a ring.

190
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:28,962
Stop it. Just stop it!

191
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:31,409
If you were anywhere near this
kind of thing again,

192
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,696
you could have called,
you could have talked to me.

193
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,661
Please, do relax.
This is all for a case.

194
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:37,668
What kind of case would need
you doing this?

195
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:40,516
I might as well ask you why you've
started cycling to work?

196
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:42,482
No, we're not playing this game.

197
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:45,010
Quite recently, I'd say,
you're very determined about it.

198
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,216
Not interested. I am. Ow!

199
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:49,864
Oh, sorry, you moved,
but it is just a sprain.

200
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:52,392
Yeah, somebody hit me. Huh?

201
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,204
Yeah, just some guy.

202
00:12:57,327 --> 00:13:00,295
Yeah, it was probably just
an addict in need of a fix.

203
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,984
Yes, I think in a way it was.

204
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:07,276
Is it his shirt? I'm sorry?

205
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:09,202
Well, it's the creases, isn't it?

206
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:13,535
The two creases down the front.

207
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:16,023
It's been recently folded,
but it's not new.

208
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:18,550
You must have dressed in a hurry
this morning.

209
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,877
So all your shirts must be
kept like that.

210
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,167
But why?

211
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,936
Maybe cos you cycle to work
every morning, shower

212
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:30,386
when you get there and then dress
in the clothes you brought with you.

213
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:34,117
You keep your shirts folded,
ready to pack.

214
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,518
Not bad.

215
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,035
And I further deduce...

216
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:43,824
...you've only started recently
because you've got a bit of chafing.

217
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:45,541
No, he's always walked like that.

218
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,178
Remind me, what's your name again?

219
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:49,893
They call me the Wig.
No, they don't.

220
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:51,889
Well, they... they call me Wiggy.

221
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,007
Nope.

222
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:58,078
Bill. Bill Wiggins.

223
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,353
Nice observational skills, Billy.

224
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,145
Ah, finally!

225
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:07,341
Finally what? Good news?

226
00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:09,897
Oh, excellent news, the best.

227
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:12,851
There's every chance that my drug
habit might hit the newspapers.

228
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,923
The game is on.
Excuse me... for a second.

229
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:22,792
You've heard of Charles Augustus
Magnussen, of course?

230
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:26,186
Yeah. Owns some newspapers.
Ones I don't read.

231
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:28,462
Hang on, weren't there other people?

232
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:31,697
Mary's taking the boys home,
I'm taking you, we did discuss it.

233
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:35,130
People were talking, none of them
were me, I must have filtered.

234
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:37,526
I noticed. I have to filter out
a lot of witless babble.

235
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:40,081
I've got Mrs Hudson
on semi-permanent mute.

236
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:45,951
What is my brother doing here?

237
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,146
So I'll just pay, then, shall I?

238
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:49,823
He's straightened the knocker.

239
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:53,257
He always corrects it, it's OCD,
doesn't even know he's doing it.

240
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:56,650
Why do you do that? Do what?
Nothing.

241
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,360
Well then, Sherlock,
back on the sauce?

242
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,397
What are you doing here?
I phoned him.

243
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:08,150
The siren call of old habits.
How very like Uncle Rudy.

244
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,182
Though in many ways, cross-dressing would have
been a wiser path for you. You phoned him.

245
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,538
Of course I bloody phoned him.
Of course he bloody did.

246
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,254
Now save me a little time -
where should we be looking?

247
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:19,090
"We"?
Mr Holmes?

248
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:22,244
For God's sake!

249
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:29,631
Anderson?! Sorry, Sherlock,
it's for your own good.

250
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:33,384
Oh, that's him, isn't it?
You said he'd be taller.

251
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:36,977
Some members of your little fan
club. Do be polite.

252
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,612
They're entirely trustworthy
and even willing to search

253
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:42,767
through the toxic waste dump that
you are pleased to call a flat.

254
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,883
You're a celebrity these days,
Sherlock.

255
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,440
You can't afford a drug habit.

256
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,153
- I do not have a drug habit.
- Hey, what happened to my chair?

257
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:52,388
It was blocking my view to the
kitchen.

258
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,786
Well, it's good to be missed!

259
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,100
You were gone, I saw an opportunity.
No, you saw the kitchen.

260
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:59,057
What have you found so far?
Clearly, nothing.

261
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,654
There's nothing to find!

262
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:03,568
Your bedroom door is shut.
You haven't been home all night.

263
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:06,803
So, why would a man who has never
knowingly closed a door without

264
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:10,116
the direct orders of his mother
bother to do so on this occasion?

265
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:13,271
OK, stop, just stop! Point made.

266
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:14,748
Jesus, Sherlock!

267
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:18,381
I shall have to phone our parents,
of course. In Oklahoma.

268
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:21,097
It won't be the first time that
your substance abuse

269
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,572
has wreaked
havoc with their line dancing.

270
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,842
This is not what you think.
This is for a case.

271
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,959
What case could possibly
justify this?

272
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,875
Magnussen.

273
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,310
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

274
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:43,416
That name you think you may have
just heard, you were mistaken.

275
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,851
If you ever mention hearing that
name in this room,

276
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,526
in this context,
I guarantee you, on behalf

277
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:51,441
of the British Security Services,
that materials will be found on

278
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:55,393
your computer hard-drives, resulting
in your immediate incarceration.

279
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,228
Don't reply, just look frightened
and scuttle.

280
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:03,419
I hope I won't have to
threaten you as well.

281
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:08,369
Well, I think we'd both find
that embarrassing.

282
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,967
Magnussen is not your business.

283
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:12,961
Oh, you mean he's yours? You may
consider him under my protection.

284
00:17:12,962 --> 00:17:14,718
I consider you under his thumb.

285
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,635
If you go against Magnussen,

286
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,870
then you will find yourself
going against me.

287
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,186
OK. I'll let you know if I notice.

288
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:24,061
Um, what was I going to say?
Oh, yeah.

289
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:25,657
Bye-bye.

290
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:31,881
Unwise, brother mine.

291
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:34,075
Ohh! Ugh!

292
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:35,231
Brother mine...

293
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:40,019
...don't appal me when I'm high.

294
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,855
Mycroft, don't say another word,
just go.

295
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:44,208
He could snap you in two
and right now,

296
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:46,802
I'm slightly worried that he might.

297
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,831
Don't speak, just leave.

298
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:54,302
Oh.

299
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,393
Er, Magnussen?

300
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:08,306
What time is it? About eight.

301
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,939
I'll be meeting him in three hours.
I need a bath.

302
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,932
It's for a case, you say? Yep.
What sort of case?

303
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,724
Too big and dangerous for any sane
individual to get involved in.

304
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,477
You trying to put me off? God, no.

305
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,793
Trying to recruit you.

306
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,105
And stay out of my bedroom.

307
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:37,590
Oh, John, hi. How are you?

308
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,707
Janine?

309
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:41,858
Sorry, not dressed.
Has everybody gone?

310
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,252
I heard shouting.
Yes, they're gone.

311
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,407
God, look at the time. I'll be late.

312
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:49,518
It sounded like an argument.
Was it Mike? Mike?

313
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,630
Mike, yeah. His brother, Mike.
They're always fighting.

314
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,867
Mycroft.

315
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:55,423
Do people actually call him that?

316
00:18:55,424 --> 00:18:56,620
Yeah. Huh!

317
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,735
Oh, could you be a love
and put some coffee on?

318
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:00,171
Sure, right, yeah.

319
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,835
Thanks. Oh, how is Mary?
How's married life?

320
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,371
She's fine. We're both fine. Yeah.

321
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:09,350
Oh, it's over there now.
Where's Sherl?

322
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,443
(Sherl!)

323
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:14,342
Er, he's just having a bath.
I'm sure he'll be out in a minute.

324
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,314
Oh, like he ever is! Yeah.

325
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:22,233
Morning. Room for a little one?

326
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,546
Morning.

327
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,727
Ooh!

328
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:34,712
So, it's just a guess, but you've
probably got some questions?

329
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:37,088
Yeah, one or two. Pretty much.

330
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:38,497
Naturally.

331
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,829
You have a girlfriend? Yes, I have.

332
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:50,493
Now, Magnussen.
Magnussen is like a shark.

333
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:52,089
It's the only way
I can describe him.

334
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,562
Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London
Aquarium, John? Stood up close to the glass?

335
00:19:55,563 --> 00:20:01,217
Those floating, flat faces,
those dead eyes. That's what he is.

336
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:05,914
I've dealt with murderers,
psychopaths,

337
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,284
terrorists, serial killers.

338
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:13,315
None of them can turn my stomach
like Charles Augustus Magnussen.

339
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,558
Yes, you have?

340
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,901
Sorry, what?

341
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:20,981
You have a girlfriend? What? Yes,
yes, I'm going out with Janine.

342
00:20:20,982 --> 00:20:23,746
I thought that was fairly obvious.
Yes. Well, yes.

343
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,563
You... You... You are
in a relationship?

344
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,341
Yes, I am.

345
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:33,145
You and Janine? Hmm.
Yes, me and Janine.

346
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:34,251
Care to elaborate?

347
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:38,990
Well, we're in a good place.
It's, um...

348
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,241
very affirming.
You got that from a book.

349
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,611
Everyone got that from a book.

350
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:47,323
OK, you two bad boys.
Behave yourselves.

351
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:50,528
You, Sherl, you're going to have to
tell me where you were last night.

352
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:53,452
Working. Working? Of course.

353
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,616
I'm the only one who really knows
what you're like, remember?

354
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:58,339
Well, don't you go letting on.

355
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:00,982
I might just, actually.

356
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:05,148
I haven't told Mary about this.

357
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:08,313
I kind of wanted to surprise her.
Yeah, I think you probably will.

358
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:10,836
But we should have you two
over for dinner, really soon.

359
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:14,081
Yeah. My place though,
not the scuzz-dump.

360
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,003
Great, yeah.

361
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,686
Dinner, yeah.

362
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:21,130
I'd better dash. It was
brilliant to see you. You too.

363
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:27,179
Have a lovely day. Call me later.

364
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,087
I might do. I might call you.

365
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,175
Unless I meet someone prettier.

366
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:42,209
Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.

367
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:50,094
You know Magnussen
as a newspaper owner,

368
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:51,776
but he is so much more than that.

369
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,281
He uses his power and wealth
to gain information.

370
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:57,255
The more he acquires,
the greater his wealth and power.

371
00:21:57,255 --> 00:22:01,716
And I'm not exaggerating when I say that he knows
the critical pressure point on every person of note

372
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:05,120
or influence in the whole of the
Western World and probably beyond.

373
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:07,734
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

374
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:12,644
And he has created an unassailable
architecture of forbidden knowledge.

375
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,585
Its name...

376
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,367
is Appledore.

377
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:19,653
Dinner? Sorry, what dinner?

378
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:22,742
Me and Mary coming for dinner with...

379
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:24,366
wine and...

380
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:26,545
sitting.

381
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,435
Seriously? I have just told you that
the Western World is run

382
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:32,762
from this house and you want to talk about
dinner? Fine. Talk about the house.

383
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:38,029
It is the greatest repository
of sensitive and dangerous

384
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:39,731
information anywhere in the world,

385
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:42,464
the Alexandrian Library
of secrets and scandals

386
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:44,562
and none of it is on a computer.

387
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,463
He's smart. Computers can be hacked.

388
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:49,236
It's all on hard copy, in vaults,
underneath that house.

389
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:51,889
And as long as it is,
the personal freedom of anyone

390
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:53,750
you've ever met is a fantasy.

391
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:57,631
That was the doorbell.
Couldn't you hear it?

392
00:22:57,632 --> 00:23:00,622
It's in the fridge. It kept ringing.
Oh, that's not a fault, Sherlock!

393
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:02,359
Who is it?

394
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,876
Mr Holmes said you can go right up.

395
00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:20,667
Oh. Go ahead.

396
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:24,466
Sir?

397
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:26,769
Can I have a moment?

398
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,103
He's fine.

399
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:34,165
Look, I... Right.
I should probably tell you...

400
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:35,781
OK, I...

401
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:36,873
There.

402
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,562
Doesn't mean I'm not
pleased to see you.

403
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:47,623
I can vouch for this man.
He is a doctor.

404
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:50,492
If you know who I am,
then you know who he is.

405
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:52,190
Don't you, Mr Magnussen?

406
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,494
I understood we were meeting
at YOUR office.

407
00:23:58,494 --> 00:23:59,908
This is my office.

408
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:08,476
Well, it is now.

409
00:24:12,073 --> 00:24:15,993
Mr Magnussen, I have been
asked to intercede with you

410
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:18,095
by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood

411
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:20,923
on the matter
of her husband's letters.

412
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:25,329
Some time ago you put pressure
on her concerning those letters.

413
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:28,481
She would like those letters back.

414
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:34,543
Obviously, the letters no longer
have any practical use to you,

415
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:36,199
so with that in mind...

416
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:39,797
Something I said?

417
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,696
No, no. I was reading.

418
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:46,626
There's rather a lot.

419
00:24:49,092 --> 00:24:51,031
Redbeard?

420
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:57,377
Sorry. Sorry, you were
probably talking.

421
00:24:57,377 --> 00:24:59,074
I...

422
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:02,875
I was trying to explain that I have
been asked to act on behalf of...

423
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,853
Bathroom?
Along from the kitchen, sir.

424
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:09,524
OK. I've been asked to negotiate
the return of those letters.

425
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:12,527
I am aware you do not make copies
of sensitive documents.

426
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:16,874
Is it like the rest of the flat?
Sir? The bathroom?

427
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:19,719
Yes, sir. Maybe not then.

428
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,440
Am I acceptable to you
as an intermediary?

429
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,440
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood...

430
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,840
I like her.

431
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,921
Mr Magnussen,
am I acceptable to you

432
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:36,761
as an intermediary?

433
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:38,361
She's English with a spine.

434
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:45,402
Best thing about the English...

435
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:50,682
...you're so domesticated.

436
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:53,843
All standing around, apologising...

437
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:57,763
...keeping your little heads down.

438
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:03,724
You can do what you like here.
No-one's ever going to stop you.

439
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:06,244
A nation of herbivores.

440
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,805
I have interests
all over the world but...

441
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:12,605
everything starts in England.

442
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:16,005
If it works here...

443
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,526
...I try it in a real country.

444
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:26,166
The United Kingdom,

445
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,646
Petri dish to the Western World.

446
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:34,607
Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need
those letters so...

447
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:35,887
I'm keeping them.

448
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:40,168
Goodbye.

449
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:42,128
Anyway...

450
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,328
...they're funny.

451
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:53,649
Jesus!

452
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:56,609
Did you notice the one
extraordinary thing he did?

453
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,650
There was a moment that
kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.

454
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,050
Exactly. When he showed us
the letters.

455
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:06,735
OK. So, he's brought
the letters to London,

456
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:08,936
so no matter what he says,
he's ready to make a deal.

457
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:12,565
Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once
he's established a person's weaknesses,

458
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:15,297
the pressure point, he calls it.
So, clearly he believes

459
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:19,293
I'm a drug addict
and no serious threat.

460
00:27:19,293 --> 00:27:23,574
And of course, because he's in town tonight, the
letters will be in his safe in his London office

461
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:26,835
while he's out to dinner with the Marketing
Group of GB from seven till ten.

462
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:29,771
How do you know his schedule? Because
I do. I'll see you tonight.

463
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:32,055
I've got some shopping to do.
What's tonight?

464
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:33,318
I'll text instructions.

465
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,988
Yeah, I'll text YOU if I'm available.
You are, I checked.

466
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,722
Don't bring a gun.
Why would I bring a gun?

467
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:42,851
Or a knife or a tyre lever. Probably
best not to do any arm-spraining,

468
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:45,902
but we'll see how the night goes. Are
you just assuming I'm coming along?

469
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:50,815
Time you got out of the house, John. You've put on
7lbs since you married and the cycling isn't doing it.

470
00:27:51,806 --> 00:27:55,926
It's actually 4lbs. Mary and I
think seven. See you later.

471
00:28:10,783 --> 00:28:12,446
And breaking news now.

472
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:16,052
John Garvie MP has been arrested
today on charges of corruption.

473
00:28:16,052 --> 00:28:18,032
This follows an investigation...

474
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:25,401
Magnussen's office is on the top
floor, just below his private flat.

475
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,977
There are 14 layers of security
between us and him,

476
00:28:27,977 --> 00:28:30,591
two of which aren't even
legal in this country.

477
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,831
Want to know how we're going to break in? Is that
what we're doing? Of course it's what we're doing.

478
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:37,881
Magnussen's private lift.

479
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:41,407
Goes straight to his penthouse
and office. Only he uses it

480
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:43,585
and only his keycard calls the lift.

481
00:28:43,586 --> 00:28:47,230
If anyone else even tries,
security is automatically informed.

482
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:49,528
Standard keycard for the building.

483
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:52,143
Nicked it yesterday. Only gets us
as far as the canteen.

484
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:56,937
Here we go then. If I was to use
this card on that lift now,

485
00:28:56,938 --> 00:29:00,503
what happens?
Well, the alarms would go off

486
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:02,563
and you'd be dragged away
by security. Exactly.

487
00:29:02,564 --> 00:29:06,349
Get taken to a small room somewhere
and your head kicked in.

488
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,302
Do we really need so much colour?
It passes the time.

489
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,214
But if I do this...

490
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:15,168
If you press a keycard against
your mobile phone for long enough,

491
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,831
it corrupts the magnetic strip.
The card stops working.

492
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,660
It's a common problem. Never put
your keycard with your phone.

493
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:23,421
What happens if I use the card now?

494
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:25,156
It still doesn't work.

495
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:27,600
But it doesn't read
as the wrong card now.

496
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,533
It registers as corrupted.

497
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:33,594
But if it's corrupted, how
do they know it's not Magnussen?

498
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:36,670
Would they risk dragging him off?
Probably not.

499
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:38,958
So, what do they do?
What do they have to do?

500
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:41,127
Check if it's him or not.

501
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:44,163
There's a camera at eye height
to the right of the door.

502
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,459
A live picture of the card user
is relayed directly

503
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,628
to Magnussen's personal staff
in his office,

504
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:56,349
the only people trusted
to make a positive ID.

505
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,325
At this hour,
almost certainly his PA.

506
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:02,332
So, how does that help us?

507
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,983
Human error.

508
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:06,107
I've been shopping.

509
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,608
Here we go then.

510
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,540
You realise you don't exactly
look like Magnussen?

511
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,310
Which in this case is
a considerable advantage.

512
00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:30,321
Sherlock, you complete loon. What are
you doing?! Hang on, was that...?

513
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:31,888
Hi, Janine.

514
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:34,016
Go on, let me in.

515
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:37,308
I can't. You know I can't.
Don't be silly.

516
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,316
Don't make me do it out here.

517
00:30:40,723 --> 00:30:42,730
Not in front of everyone.

518
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,456
Do what in front of everyone?

519
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,498
You see, as long as there's people, there's
always a weak spot. That was Janine.

520
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:05,462
Yes, of course it was.
She's Magnussen's PA.

521
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:09,863
That's the whole point. Did you just get engaged to
break into an office? Yeah. Stroke of luck meeting her

522
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:13,321
at your wedding. You can take
some of the credit. Jesus!

523
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:17,905
Sherlock, she loves you.
Yes. Like I said, human error.

524
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:23,653
What are you going to do? Well, not
actually marry her, obviously.

525
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:26,829
There's only so far you can go.
So, what will you tell her?

526
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:30,004
Well, I'll tell her that our entire
relationship was a ruse

527
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:32,819
to break into her boss's office.
I imagine she'll want to stop

528
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,553
seeing me at that point,
but you're the expert on women.

529
00:31:44,117 --> 00:31:45,587
So, where did she go?

530
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,250
That's a bit rude.
I just proposed to her.

531
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:49,562
Sherlock.

532
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:51,630
Did she faint?

533
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,458
Do they really do that?!

534
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:55,486
It's a blow to the head.

535
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:57,115
She's breathing.

536
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,149
Janine?

537
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,370
Another in here.

538
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,596
Security.

539
00:32:03,596 --> 00:32:04,828
Does he need help?

540
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,382
Ex-con. White supremacist
by the tattoos, so who cares?

541
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:13,495
Stick with Janine.

542
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:18,743
Janine, focus on my voice.
Can you hear me?

543
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:29,317
Hey, they must still be here.

544
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:31,186
So is Magnussen.
His seat's still warm.

545
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:34,127
He should be at dinner,
but he's still in the building.

546
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:37,030
Upstairs. We should call the police.
During our own burglary?

547
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,971
You're really not a natural
at this, are you?

548
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:41,601
No, wait. Sssh.

549
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:46,054
Perfume and not Janine's.

550
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:50,745
Claire de la Lune.
Why do I know it?

551
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:53,966
Mary wears it. No, not Mary.
Somebody else.

552
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:57,997
Sherlock!

553
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,240
What would your husband think?

554
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:12,493
Your lovely husband,
upright and honourable,

555
00:33:12,494 --> 00:33:15,787
so English. What would
he say to you now?

556
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,554
No, no!

557
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:21,730
You're doing this to protect
him from the truth?

558
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:24,301
Well, is this the protection
he would want?

559
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:26,429
Additionally, if you're
going to commit murder,

560
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:30,244
you might consider changing
your perfume, Lady Smallwood.

561
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:34,180
Sorry. Who?

562
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,456
That's... not Lady Smallwood,
Mr Holmes.

563
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:58,556
Is John with you? He's, um...

564
00:33:58,557 --> 00:33:59,601
Is John here?

565
00:34:01,046 --> 00:34:02,210
He's downstairs.

566
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:07,512
So, what do you do now?

567
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,238
Kill us both?

568
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,817
Mary, whatever he's got on you,
let me help.

569
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:17,190
Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more
step, I swear I will kill you.

570
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,679
No, Mrs Watson...

571
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,286
you won't.

572
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:30,764
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

573
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:32,531
I truly am.

574
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:36,346
Mary?

575
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:45,382
It's not like it is in the movies.

576
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:49,638
There's not a great big spurt of
blood and you go flying backwards.

577
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:52,369
The impact isn't spread
over a wide area.

578
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,221
It's tightly focused so there's
little or no energy transfer.

579
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:58,152
You stay still
and the bullet pushes through.

580
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:01,807
You're almost certainly going
to die, so we need to focus.

581
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:06,425
I said, "Focus!"

582
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,681
It's all well and clever
having a mind palace,

583
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:13,372
but you've only three seconds
of consciousness left to use it.

584
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:16,023
So, come on.
What's going to kill you?

585
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:19,974
Blood loss. Exactly.
So, it's all about one thing now -

586
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:22,319
forwards or backwards?

587
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,748
We need to decide which way
you're going to fall.

588
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:28,822
One hole or two? Sorry?
Is the bullet still inside you?

589
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:31,580
Or is there an exit wound?
It'll depend on the gun.

590
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,843
That one, I think.

591
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:35,343
Or that one.

592
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:40,070
Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock.
It doesn't matter about the gun.

593
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,762
Don't be stupid.

594
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:44,030
You always were so stupid.

595
00:35:44,031 --> 00:35:46,106
Such a disappointment.

596
00:35:46,106 --> 00:35:47,643
I'm not stupid.

597
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:50,027
You're a very stupid little boy.

598
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:52,141
Mummy and Daddy are very cross

599
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:55,447
because it doesn't matter
about the gun.

600
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:56,678
Why not?

601
00:35:56,678 --> 00:35:58,792
You saw the whole room
when you entered it.

602
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:01,290
What was directly behind you
when you were murdered?

603
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,443
I've not been murdered YET.

604
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:05,656
Balance of probability,
little brother.

605
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:12,253
If the bullet had passed through
you, what would you have heard?

606
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,702
The mirror shattering.

607
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:15,230
You didn't. Therefore...?

608
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:18,891
The bullet's still inside me.

609
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,943
So we need to take him
down backwards.

610
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:23,919
I agree. Sherlock,
you need to fall on your back.

611
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,172
Right now the bullet is
the cork in a bottle.

612
00:36:26,173 --> 00:36:28,747
The bullet itself is blocking
most of the blood flow.

613
00:36:28,748 --> 00:36:32,127
But any pressure or impact on the
entrance wound could dislodge it.

614
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:35,667
Plus, on your back, gravity's
working for us.

615
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:36,994
Fall...

616
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,242
now.

617
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:56,103
What the hell is that?!
What's happening?!

618
00:36:57,311 --> 00:37:00,368
You're going into shock. It's the
next thing that's going to kill you.

619
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:03,344
What do I do? Don't go
into shock, obviously.

620
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:06,523
Must be something in this ridiculous
memory palace of yours

621
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:07,971
that can calm you down.

622
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:10,746
Find it.

623
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:15,172
The East Wind is coming, Sherlock.

624
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:16,862
It's coming to get you.

625
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:23,540
Find it.

626
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:28,488
Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy.

627
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:31,103
Come on. Come to me.

628
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,913
It's OK. It's all right.

629
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:34,965
Come on.
It's me. It's me.

630
00:37:34,966 --> 00:37:36,172
Come on.

631
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,103
Good boy. Clever boy.

632
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:39,591
Good boy.

633
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:42,488
Hello, Redbeard. They're putting
me down too now.

634
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:46,109
It's no fun, is it?

635
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:47,798
Redbeard.

636
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,890
That was shock. You're going
to feel the pain.

637
00:37:56,891 --> 00:38:00,149
There's a hole ripped through you.

638
00:38:00,149 --> 00:38:02,361
Massive internal bleeding.

639
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:04,655
You have to control the pain.

640
00:38:08,597 --> 00:38:10,608
Control. Control. Control.

641
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:15,114
You...

642
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:19,097
You never felt pain, did you?

643
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:22,919
Why did you never feel pain?

644
00:38:22,919 --> 00:38:25,654
You always feel it, Sherlock.

645
00:38:32,132 --> 00:38:34,626
But you don't have to fear it!

646
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:43,315
Pain...

647
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:46,493
...heartbreak...

648
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:49,269
...loss...

649
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:53,775
...death...

650
00:38:53,775 --> 00:38:55,343
...it's all good.

651
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:58,924
It's all good.

652
00:38:58,924 --> 00:39:01,900
Sherlock! Sherlock. Can you hear me?

653
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,389
What happened?

654
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,637
He got shot.

655
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:05,763
Jesus!

656
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:07,090
Sherlock.

657
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:08,700
Oh, my!

658
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,906
Who shot him?!

659
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:12,159
'Emergency. Which service
do you require?'

660
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,372
♪ It's raining

661
00:39:14,373 --> 00:39:17,363

666

Sherlock!

667
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,943
We're losing you. Sherlock!

668
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:42,924
Come on, Sherlock.
Just die, why can't you?

669
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,314
One little push

670
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:47,829
and off you pop.

671
00:39:56,603 --> 00:40:00,510
You're going to love being dead,
Sherlock. No-one ever bothers you.

672
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:05,415
Mrs Hudson will cry...

673
00:40:05,415 --> 00:40:07,727
and Mummy and Daddy will cry...

674
00:40:07,728 --> 00:40:11,954
and the woman will cry and John
will cry buckets and buckets.

675
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:16,022
It's him that I worry about
the most. That wife!

676
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:18,256
You're letting him down, Sherlock.

677
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:21,206
John Watson is definitely in danger.

678
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:38,034
Oh, you're not getting
better, are you?

679
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,669
Was it something I said, huh?

680
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,847
Sherlock!

681
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:39,007
Mary. Hey.

682
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:40,734
He's only bloody woken up.

683
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:44,107
He's pulled through. Really?
Yeah. Seriously? You...

684
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:46,877
Mrs Watson, you're in big trouble.

685
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:48,283
Really? Why?

686
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:50,251
His first word when he woke up...

687
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:51,496
"Mary."

688
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,297
You don't tell him.

689
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:15,831
Sherlock?

690
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:19,405
You don't tell John.

691
00:42:24,506 --> 00:42:26,674
Bad girl.

692
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,449
Bad, bad girl.

693
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:33,903
Look at me...

694
00:42:35,147 --> 00:42:37,435
...and tell me you're not
going to tell him.

695
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,797
I'm buying a cottage.

696
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:51,290
I've made a lot of money
out of you, mister.

697
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,660
Nothing hits the spot
like revenge with profits.

698
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,149
You didn't give those stories
to Magnussen, did you?

699
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,362
God, no. One of his rivals.
He was spitting.

700
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:00,968
Hmm.

701
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:03,458
Sherlock Holmes, you are
a back-stabbing, heartless,

702
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,224
manipulative bastard.

703
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:08,397
And you, as it turns out,
are a grasping, opportunistic,

704
00:43:08,398 --> 00:43:10,887
publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.

705
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,348
So, we're good then?

706
00:43:12,348 --> 00:43:14,360
Yeah, of course.

707
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:17,084
Where's the cottage? Sussex Downs.

708
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:18,978
Nice. It's gorgeous.

709
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:21,347
There's beehives,
but I'm getting rid of those.

710
00:43:21,347 --> 00:43:24,622
Oh, it hurts, does it?

711
00:43:24,623 --> 00:43:26,675
Probably want to restart
your morphine.

712
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:28,293
I might have fiddled with the taps.

713
00:43:28,293 --> 00:43:31,766
How much more revenge are you going
to need? Just the occasional top-up.

714
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:33,898
Dream come true for you, this place.

715
00:43:33,898 --> 00:43:36,068
They actually attach
the drugs to you.

716
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:37,687
Not good for working.

717
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:40,213
You won't be working
for a while, Sherl.

718
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:42,107
You lied to me.

719
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,397
You lied and lied.

720
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:47,159
I exploited the fact
of our connection.

721
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,423
When?

722
00:43:49,923 --> 00:43:51,916
Just once would have been nice.

723
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:53,470
Oh.

724
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,821
I was waiting till we got married.

725
00:43:55,822 --> 00:43:57,934
That was never going to happen.

726
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:02,678
Got to go.

727
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:06,824
I'm not supposed
to keep you talking.

728
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:09,454
And also, I have an interview
with The One Show

729
00:44:09,455 --> 00:44:11,846
and I haven't made it up yet.

730
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:15,554
Just one thing...

731
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:18,065
you shouldn't have lied to me.

732
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:20,537
I know what kind of man you are,

733
00:44:20,537 --> 00:44:23,247
but we could have been friends.

734
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:25,360
I'll give your love
to John and Mary.

735
00:44:44,136 --> 00:44:46,647
You don't tell him.

736
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:48,998
You don't tell John.

737
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:50,354
So...

738
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,340
...Mary Watson...

739
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:58,805
...who are you?

740
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:06,897
Mary Watson.

741
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:17,660
I don't know how much sense
you'll get out of him.

742
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:19,853
He's drugged up,
so he's pretty much babbling.

743
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:22,045
Oh, they won't let you use
that in here, you know?

744
00:45:22,046 --> 00:45:25,474
No, I'm not going to use the phone.
I just want to take a video.

745
00:45:31,453 --> 00:45:32,768
Oh, Jesus!

746
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,834
So, where would he go?

747
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,509
Oh, Christ knows!

748
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:40,980
Try finding Sherlock in London.

749
00:45:42,894 --> 00:45:45,285
He's got three known bolt-holes.

750
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:48,275
Parliament Hill, Camden Lock
and Dagmar Court.

751
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:49,923
Five known bolt holes.

752
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:52,213
There's the blind greenhouse
in Kew Gardens

753
00:45:52,214 --> 00:45:54,303
and the leaning tomb
in Hampstead Cemetery.

754
00:45:54,304 --> 00:45:55,790
Just the spare bedroom.

755
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,080
Well, my bedroom.

756
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:59,728
We agreed he needs the space.

757
00:46:03,024 --> 00:46:05,515
Behind the clock face of Big Ben.

758
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:07,163
I think he was probably joking.

759
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:08,448
No, I don't think so.

760
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:12,668
Leinster Gardens. It's his number
one bolt hole. Top, top secret.

761
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,919
He only knows about it
cos he stalked him one night.

762
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:17,812
Followed! Followed, yeah.

763
00:46:17,813 --> 00:46:19,782
He knew who shot him.

764
00:46:19,782 --> 00:46:22,675
The bullet wound was here,
so he was facing whoever it was.

765
00:46:22,675 --> 00:46:26,452
So, why not tell us? Because he's
tracking them down himself.

766
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,783
Or protecting them.
Protecting the shooter, why?

767
00:46:28,784 --> 00:46:31,275
Well, protecting someone then.
But why would he care?

768
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:34,047
He's Sherlock. Who would he
bother protecting?

769
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:38,348
Call me if you hear anything.
Don't hold out on me, John.

770
00:46:38,348 --> 00:46:40,678
Call me, OK? Yeah. Yeah, right.

771
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:43,693
Good night then. Bye then.

772
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:47,912
John, need a cuppa?

773
00:46:47,913 --> 00:46:51,891
Mrs Hudson, why does Sherlock think
that I'll be moving back in here?

774
00:46:51,891 --> 00:46:54,744
Oh, yes, he's put your chair
back again, hasn't he?

775
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:57,315
That's nice. It looks much better.

776
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:03,062
John, what's wrong? Tell me. John?

777
00:47:03,063 --> 00:47:07,403
That's your phone, isn't it?

778
00:47:07,403 --> 00:47:09,854
It's Sherlock, John. Sherlock.

779
00:47:09,855 --> 00:47:13,190
John, you have to answer it!

780
00:47:18,455 --> 00:47:20,584
Spare any change, love? No.
Oh, come on, love.

781
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,271
Don't be like all the rest.

782
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:29,466
Rule one of looking
for Sherlock Holmes, he finds you.

783
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:32,801
You're working for Sherlock now?

784
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:36,498
Keeps me off the streets,
doesn't it? Well... no.

785
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,812
Where are you?
'Can't you see me?'

786
00:47:43,812 --> 00:47:45,781
Well, what am I looking for?

787
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:49,581
'The lie, the lie of Leinster
Gardens, hidden in plain sight.

788
00:47:51,683 --> 00:47:54,795
'Hardly anyone notices. People live
here for years and never see it.

789

'But if you are what I think you are,
it will take you less than a minute.

790
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:01,787
'The houses, Mary.
Look at the houses.'

791
00:48:01,787 --> 00:48:03,888
How did you know I'd come here?

792
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:07,769
'I knew you'd talk to the people
no-one else would bother with.'

793
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,993
Huh, I thought I was being clever.

794
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:12,903
'You're always clever,
Mary, I was relying on that.

795
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:15,368
'I planted the information
for you to find.'

796
00:48:15,368 --> 00:48:17,591
Ohh!

797
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:18,763
'30 seconds.'

798
00:48:18,764 --> 00:48:20,461
But what am I looking at?

799
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:24,987
'No door knobs, no letterbox.
Painted windows.

800
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:28,181

Huh, it's a dummy.

Well, I suppose that was a fairly
obvious trick.

And yet,
over a distance of six feet,

841
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,051
you failed to make a kill shot.

00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:06,696
Enough to hospitalise me,
not enough to kill me.

843

That wasn't a miss,
that was surgery.

844
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:18,384
I'll take the case. What case?

00:51:18,385 --> 00:51:22,988
Yours. Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

846
00:51:22,988 --> 00:51:26,750
Because John can't ever know that
I lied to him.

847
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,393
It would break him
and I would lose him forever.

848
00:51:29,393 --> 00:51:31,874
And Sherlock, I will never
let that happen.

849
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,438
Please, understand,

850
00:51:36,439 --> 00:51:41,522

would not do to stop that happening.

Sorry.

852
00:51:45,245 --> 00:51:46,966
Not that obvious a trick.

853
00:52:02,218 --> 00:52:05,620
Now talk and sort it out
and do it quickly.

00:52:39,126 --> 00:52:41,407
Why are we doing this?
We never do this.

863
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,130
We are here because Sherlock
is home from hospital

864
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,291
and we are all very happy.

865
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:47,933
Am I happy too? I haven't checked.

866
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:49,173
Behave, Mike!

867
00:52:49,174 --> 00:52:50,855
Mycroft is the name you gave me,

868
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:54,777
if you could possibly struggle all
the way to the end. Mrs Holmes.

869
00:52:54,778 --> 00:52:59,181
Oh, thank you, dear. I'm not
absolutely sure why you're here.

870
00:52:59,182 --> 00:53:00,583
I invited him.

871
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,304
I'm his protege, Mrs Holmes.

872
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,386
When he dies,
I get all his stuff and his job.

873
00:53:05,386 --> 00:53:07,907
No. Oh, well, I help out a bit.

874
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:09,989
Closer.

875
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:11,831
If he does get murdered or
something...

876
00:53:11,831 --> 00:53:13,912
Probably stop talking now. OK.

877
00:53:13,913 --> 00:53:16,034
Lovely when you
bring your friends round(!)

878
00:53:16,034 --> 00:53:19,196
Stop it, you.
Somebody's put a bullet in my boy.

879
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:23,840
If I ever find out who,
I shall turn absolutely monstrous.

880
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,122
This was for Mary.
I'll be back in a minute.

881
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,168
Ah. Mary. There you are.

882
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:37,530
Cup of tea. If Father starts
making little humming noises,

883
00:53:37,531 --> 00:53:40,613
just give him a little poke.
That usually does it.

884
00:53:40,613 --> 00:53:42,694
Did you write this?

885
00:53:42,695 --> 00:53:44,816
Oh, that silly old thing,
you mustn't read that.

886
00:53:44,816 --> 00:53:47,978
Mathematics must seem terribly
fatuous now.

887
00:53:47,979 --> 00:53:50,060
No humming, you.

888
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,704
Complete flake, my wife, but happens
to be a genius.

889
00:53:55,705 --> 00:53:57,266
She was a mathematician?

890
00:53:57,266 --> 00:54:02,910
Gave it all up for children. I could
never bear to argue with her.

891
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,632
I'm something of a moron myself.

892
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:09,394
But she's... unbelievably hot.

893
00:54:09,395 --> 00:54:13,398
Oh my God, you're the sane one,
aren't you?

894
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:15,680
Aren't you?

895
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:22,325
Oh. Sorry, I just, er...

896
00:54:24,206 --> 00:54:26,687
Oh, you two need a moment?

897
00:54:26,688 --> 00:54:28,569
If you don't mind?

898
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:32,533
No, course not. I'll go and see if
I can help with...

899
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:34,014
something or another.

900
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:45,462
Those two. They all right?

901
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:48,825
Well, you know,
they've had their ups and downs.

902
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:54,789
Baker Street, now.

903
00:55:06,038 --> 00:55:09,520
John, Mary...

904
00:55:12,123 --> 00:55:15,445
Oh, Sherlock, oh, good gracious,
you look terrible!

905
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,846
Get me some morphine
from your kitchen, I've run out.

906
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:21,489
I don't have any morphine. Then what
exactly is the point of you?!

907
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,011
What is going on?

908
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:24,332
Bloody good question.

909
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:28,335
The Watsons are about to have a domestic and fairly
quickly I hope, because we've got work to do.

910
00:55:28,335 --> 00:55:29,696
No, I have a better question -

911
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:33,779
is everyone I have ever met
a psychopath?

912
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,301
Yes.

913
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:39,063
Good that we've settled that.
Now we... SHUT UP!

914
00:55:40,304 --> 00:55:44,026
And stay shut up,
because this is not funny.

915
00:55:44,027 --> 00:55:45,067
Not this time.

916
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:47,910
I didn't say it was funny. You.

917
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,632
What have I ever done? Hmm?

918
00:55:51,873 --> 00:55:54,434
My whole life, to deserve you?

919
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:55,996
Everything.

920
00:55:55,996 --> 00:55:58,678
Sherlock, I've told you, shut up.

921
00:55:58,678 --> 00:56:00,719
No, I mean it -
seriously, everything.

922
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,041
Everything you've ever done,
is what you did.

923
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:05,443
Sherlock, one more word
and you will not need morphine.

924
00:56:05,443 --> 00:56:07,444
You were a doctor who went to war.

925
00:56:07,445 --> 00:56:10,327
You're a man who couldn't stay in
the suburbs for more than a month

926
00:56:10,327 --> 00:56:12,728
without storming a crack den,
beating up a junkie.

927
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:15,250
Your best friend is a
sociopath, who solves crimes

928
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:18,893
as an alternative to getting high.
That's me, by the way, hello.

929
00:56:18,894 --> 00:56:20,815
Even the landlady used to
run a drug cartel.

930
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:23,817
It was my husband's cartel.
I was just typing.

931
00:56:23,817 --> 00:56:25,458
And exotic dancing.

932
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:27,860
Sherlock Holmes,
if you've been YouTubing...

933
00:56:27,861 --> 00:56:31,623
John, you are addicted to
a certain lifestyle.

934
00:56:31,623 --> 00:56:35,946
You are abnormally attracted to
dangerous situations and people,

935
00:56:35,947 --> 00:56:40,830
so is it truly such a surprise
that the woman you fall in love with

936
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,471
conforms to that pattern?

937
00:56:42,472 --> 00:56:44,873
But she wasn't supposed to
be like that!

938
00:56:48,797 --> 00:56:50,478
Why is SHE like that?

939
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,001
Because you chose her.

940
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:03,287
Why is everything always

941
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:07,370
Oh, neighbours!

942
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:09,972
John, listen. Be calm and answer me.

943
00:57:09,973 --> 00:57:11,934
What is she?

944
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:14,175
My lying wife? No, what is she?

945
00:57:14,176 --> 00:57:17,698
And the woman who is carrying my child, who
has lied to me since the day I met her.

946
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:21,061
No. Not in this flat,
not in this room.

947
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:24,783
Right here, right now, what is she?

948
00:57:27,626 --> 00:57:28,826
OK.

949
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,151
Your way.

950
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:37,351
Always your way.

951
00:57:44,181 --> 00:57:45,539
Sit.

952
00:57:45,539 --> 00:57:46,897
Why?

953
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:48,974
Because that's where they sit.

954
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:53,048
The people who come in here
with their stories.

955
00:57:53,048 --> 00:57:55,404
They're the clients,
that's all you are now, Mary.

956
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:56,443
You're a client.

957
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:01,037
This is where you sit and talk
and this is where we sit and listen.

958
00:58:01,037 --> 00:58:02,994
Then we decide
if we want you or not.

959
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,787
So, are you OK?

960
00:58:35,787 --> 00:58:40,779
Oh, are we doing conversation today?
It really is Christmas(!)

961
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:46,931
Now?

962
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:51,324
Seriously, months of silence
and we're going to do this now?

963
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,590
A.G.R.A., what's that?

964
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:05,744
Er... my initials.

965
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,855
Everything about who
I was is on there.

966
00:59:11,856 --> 00:59:14,212
If you love me,
don't read it in front of me.

967
00:59:14,212 --> 00:59:16,129
Why?

968
00:59:16,129 --> 00:59:19,324
Because you won't love me
when you've finished

969
00:59:19,325 --> 00:59:22,121
and I don't want to see that happen.

970
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,187
How much do you know already?

971
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:35,501
By your skill set, you are, or were,
an intelligence agent.

972
00:59:35,502 --> 00:59:38,537
Your accent is currently English,
but I suspect you are not.

973
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:40,094
You're on the run from something.

974
00:59:40,095 --> 00:59:42,331
You've used your skills
to disappear.

975
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:45,247
Magnussen knows your secret, which
is why you were going to kill him.

976
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,123
And I assume you befriended
Janine in order to get close to him.

977
00:59:48,124 --> 00:59:50,400
Oh, you can talk!

978
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,715
Oh, look at you two,
you should have got married.

979
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:55,074
The stuff Magnussen has on me,

980
00:59:55,074 --> 00:59:56,871
I would go to prison for the rest of
my life.

981
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:59,946
So you were going to kill him? People
like Magnussen should be killed,

982
00:59:59,947 --> 01:00:02,383
that's why there are people like me.
Perfect!

983
01:00:02,383 --> 01:00:05,458
So that's what you were, an assassin?
How could I not see that?

984
01:00:05,459 --> 01:00:06,697
You did see that.

985
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,891
And you married me.

986
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:14,366
Because he's right.

987
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:18,040
It's what you like.

988
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:27,267
So, Mary, any documents that
Magnussen has

989
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:31,541
concerning yourself,
you want extracted and returned.

990
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,577
Why would you help me?

991
01:00:34,577 --> 01:00:35,855
Because you saved my life.

992
01:00:35,856 --> 01:00:38,172
Sorry-sorry, what?

993
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:40,448
When I happened on you
and Magnussen...

994
01:00:42,446 --> 01:00:43,684
...you had a problem.

995
01:00:44,803 --> 01:00:47,159
More specifically,
you had a witness.

996
01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:51,872
What do you do now?

997
01:00:55,388 --> 01:00:56,985
Kill both of us?

998
01:00:59,382 --> 01:01:02,737
'The solution, of course, was
simple. Kill us both and leave.'

999
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,916
However,
sentiment got the better of you.

1000
01:01:19,873 --> 01:01:22,828
'One precisely calculated shot
to incapacitate me,

1001
01:01:22,828 --> 01:01:26,942
'in the hope that it would buy you
more time to negotiate my silence.'

1002
01:01:26,943 --> 01:01:29,619
Of course,
you couldn't shoot Magnussen.

1003
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,735
On the night both of us
broke into the building,

1004
01:01:31,736 --> 01:01:34,412
your own husband would
become a suspect. So...

1005
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:44,117
'You calculated that Magnussen would
use the fact of your involvement...'

1006
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:48,631
rather than sharing the information
with the police, as is his MO.

1007
01:01:51,028 --> 01:01:55,741
And then you left the way you came.

1008
01:01:55,741 --> 01:01:57,218
Have I missed anything?

1009
01:01:57,219 --> 01:01:58,816
How did she save your life?

1010
01:01:58,817 --> 01:02:01,093
She phoned the ambulance.
I phoned the ambulance.

1011
01:02:01,094 --> 01:02:02,611
She phoned first.

1012
01:02:06,047 --> 01:02:07,964
'Emergency,
which service do you require?'

1013
01:02:07,964 --> 01:02:10,041
You didn't find me
for another five minutes.

1014
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:11,478
Left to you, I would have died.

1015
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:14,634
The average arrival
time for a London ambulance is...

1016
01:02:14,634 --> 01:02:16,750
Did somebody call an ambulance?

1017
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:19,746
Eight minutes. Did you bring any
morphine? I asked on the phone.

1018
01:02:19,747 --> 01:02:21,384
We were told there was a shooting.

1019
01:02:21,385 --> 01:02:23,102
There was, last week.

1020
01:02:23,102 --> 01:02:24,819
But I believe I'm bleeding
internally,

1021
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,975
my pulse is very erratic, you may need
to restart my heart on the way...

1022
01:02:27,975 --> 01:02:30,611
Jesus, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock.
Argh!

1023
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:35,205
John, John,
Magnussen is all that matters now.

1024
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:38,680
You can trust Mary -
she saved my life.

1025
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,277
She shot you.

1026
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:43,832
Mixed messages, I grant you that...
Argh!

1027
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:45,989
Sherlock! Sherlock! Take him.

1028
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,228
Got him? Yeah.

1029
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:02,366
So, have you read it?

1030
01:03:07,758 --> 01:03:10,234
Would you come here a moment?
No, tell me, have you?

1031
01:03:10,235 --> 01:03:12,312
Just... Come here.

1032
01:03:15,707 --> 01:03:17,304
No, I'm fine.

1033
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:25,772
I've thought long and hard
about what I want to say to you.

1034
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,206
These are prepared words, Mary.

1035
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,842
I've chosen these words with care.
OK.

1036
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:38,355
The problems of your past
are your business.

1037
01:03:40,312 --> 01:03:43,747
The problems of your future...

1038
01:03:43,747 --> 01:03:44,865
are my privilege.

1039
01:03:46,463 --> 01:03:48,380
It's all I have to say,
it's all I need to know.

1040
01:03:57,447 --> 01:03:58,845
No, I didn't read it.

1041
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,117
You don't even know my name.

1042
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,593
Is "Mary Watson" good enough for you?

1043
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,389
Yes. Oh my God, yes.

1044
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:12,226
Then it's good enough for me, too.

1045
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:20,454
All this does not mean that I'm not
still basically pissed off with you.

1046
01:04:20,455 --> 01:04:21,853
Hmm, I know, I know.

1047
01:04:21,853 --> 01:04:24,848
I am very pissed off,
and it will come out now and then.

1048
01:04:24,848 --> 01:04:26,086
I know, I know, I know.

1049
01:04:28,203 --> 01:04:30,479
You can mow the sodding
lawn from now on.

1050
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,277
I do mow the lawn. I do it loads.

1051
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:33,516
You really don't.

1052
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:35,912
I choose the baby's name.
Not a chance. OK.

1053
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:40,945
I'm glad you've given up on the
Magnussen business. Are you?

1054
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:44,539
I'm still curious, though. He's
hardly your usual kind of puzzle.

1055
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,017
Why do you hate him?

1056
01:04:46,018 --> 01:04:48,055
Because he attacks people
who are different

1057
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:50,651
and preys on their secrets.
Why don't you?

1058
01:04:50,651 --> 01:04:53,327
He never causes too much damage
to anyone important.

1059
01:04:53,328 --> 01:04:55,245
He's far too intelligent for that.

1060
01:04:55,245 --> 01:04:59,638
He's a businessman, that's all.
And occasionally useful to us.

1061
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:02,714
A necessary evil,
not a dragon for you to slay.

1062
01:05:04,592 --> 01:05:07,330
A dragon-slayer.
Is that what you think of me?

1063
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:10,599
No. It's what you think of yourself.

1064
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,030
Are you two smoking?!

1065
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,419
No. It was Mycroft.

1066
01:05:18,774 --> 01:05:23,392
I have, by the way, a job offer
I should like you to decline.

1067
01:05:23,392 --> 01:05:25,476
I decline your kind offer.

1068
01:05:25,477 --> 01:05:26,907
I shall pass on your regrets.

1069
01:05:26,907 --> 01:05:31,688
What was it? MI6. They want to
place you back into Eastern Europe.

1070
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:35,163
An undercover assignment
that would prove fatal to you in,

1071
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:38,024
I think, about six months.

1072
01:05:38,024 --> 01:05:40,598
Then why don't you want me
to take it?

1073
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:44,849
It's tempting, but on balance, you
have more utility closer to home.

1074
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:47,179
Utility! How do I have utility?

1075
01:05:49,428 --> 01:05:50,490
Here be dragons.

1076
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:55,410
This isn't agreeing with me.

1077
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,727
I'm going in.

1078
01:05:56,727 --> 01:06:00,280
You need low tar.
You still smoke like a beginner.

1079
01:06:02,476 --> 01:06:03,513
Also...

1080
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:07,067
...your loss would break my heart.

1081
01:06:08,704 --> 01:06:11,099
What the hell am
I supposed to say to that?!

1082
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:16,129
Merry Christmas? You hate Christmas.

1083
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:19,882
Yes. Perhaps there was
something in the punch.

1084
01:06:19,882 --> 01:06:21,878
Clearly. Go and have some more.

1085
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:29,064
So you realise that Sherlock got us out
here to see his mum and dad for a reason?

1086
01:06:29,064 --> 01:06:33,375
His lovely mum and dad, a fine
example of married life, I get that.

1087
01:06:33,376 --> 01:06:36,929
That is the thing with Sherlock,
it's always the unexpected.

1088
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:40,242
Oi. Oi? Mary?

1089
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:43,317
Jesus Christ! Mary? Sit down.

1090
01:06:43,317 --> 01:06:44,554
Mary, can you hear me?

1091
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,069
Don't drink Mary's tea.

1092
01:06:50,782 --> 01:06:51,819
Or the punch.

1093
01:06:57,369 --> 01:06:58,406
Sherlock...

1094
01:06:59,565 --> 01:07:01,521
Did you just drug my pregnant wife?!

1095
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:03,876
Don't worry,
Wiggins is an excellent chemist.

1096
01:07:03,877 --> 01:07:07,230
I calculated your wife's dose
myself. Won't affect the little one.

1097
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,347
I'll keep an eye on her.

1098
01:07:08,348 --> 01:07:11,382
He'll monitor their recovery.
It's more or less his day job.

1099
01:07:11,382 --> 01:07:12,659
What the hell have you done?!

1100
01:07:13,658 --> 01:07:15,694
A deal with the devil.

1101
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:25,833
Shouldn't you be in hospital?

1102
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:29,426
I am in hospital.
This is the canteen.

1103
01:07:29,427 --> 01:07:32,740
Is it? In my opinion, yes.
Have a seat.

1104
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:33,777
Thank you.

1105
01:07:35,535 --> 01:07:37,970
I've been thinking about you.

1106
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,125
I've been thinking about you.

1107
01:07:40,126 --> 01:07:41,563
Really?

1108
01:07:45,915 --> 01:07:47,352
I want to see Appledore.

1109
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:51,743
Where you keep all the secrets,
all the files,

1110
01:07:51,743 --> 01:07:54,018
everything you've got on everyone.

1111
01:07:54,019 --> 01:07:56,733
I want you to invite me.

1112
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:01,364
What makes you think
I'd be so careless?

1113
01:08:02,602 --> 01:08:06,354
Oh, I think you're a lot more
careless than you let on.

1114
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:10,067
Am I?

1115
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:17,413
It's the dead-eyed stare
that gives it away.

1116
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:22,243
Except it's not dead-eyed, is it?

1117
01:08:27,593 --> 01:08:28,870
You're reading.

1118
01:08:32,184 --> 01:08:36,455
Portable Appledore.
How does it work?

1119
01:08:37,973 --> 01:08:42,404
Built-in flash drive? 4G wireless?

1120
01:08:56,896 --> 01:08:59,610
They're just ordinary spectacles.

1121
01:08:59,611 --> 01:09:02,365
Yes, they are.

1122
01:09:13,544 --> 01:09:15,460
You underestimate me, Mr Holmes.

1123
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:28,315
Impress me, then. Show me Appledore.

1124
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:31,907
Everything is available for a price.

1125
01:09:31,908 --> 01:09:33,664
Are you making me an offer?

1126
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:34,902
A Christmas present.

1127
01:09:36,499 --> 01:09:39,892
And what are you giving me
for Christmas, Mr Holmes?

1128
01:09:39,893 --> 01:09:41,251
My brother.

1129
01:09:45,767 --> 01:09:46,806
Oh, Jesus!

1130
01:09:50,922 --> 01:09:55,357
Sherlock, please tell me you haven't
just gone out of your mind.

1131
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:56,796
I'd rather keep you guessing.

1132
01:09:58,635 --> 01:10:01,072
Ah, there's our lift.

1133
01:10:06,947 --> 01:10:08,185
Coming?

1134
01:10:08,186 --> 01:10:09,664
Where?

1135
01:10:09,665 --> 01:10:11,583
You want your wife to be safe?
Of course I do.

1136
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,980
Good, because this is going to be
incredibly dangerous.

1137
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:17,737
One false move and we'll have betrayed the
security of the United Kingdom and be in prison

1138
01:10:17,737 --> 01:10:21,053
for high treason. Magnussen is the most
dangerous man we've ever encountered

1139
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:23,731
and the odds are
comprehensively stacked against us.

1140
01:10:23,732 --> 01:10:26,129
But it's Christmas! I feel the same.

1141
01:10:26,129 --> 01:10:29,365
Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas.
Did you bring your gun, as I suggested?

1142
01:10:29,366 --> 01:10:33,282
Why would I bring my gun to your parents' house
for Christmas dinner?! Is it in your coat? Yes.

1143
01:10:33,283 --> 01:10:35,800
Off we go, then. Where are we going?
Appledore.

1144
01:11:32,427 --> 01:11:35,783
I would offer you a drink,
but it's very rare and expensive.

1145
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:44,056
Oh, it WAS you.

1146
01:11:44,056 --> 01:11:45,814
Yes, of course.

1147
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:49,411
Very hard to find a pressure
point on you, Mr Holmes.

1148
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:52,328
The drugs thing
I never believed for a moment.

1149
01:11:52,329 --> 01:11:56,605
Anyway, you wouldn't care
if it was exposed, would you?

1150
01:11:56,605 --> 01:11:59,722
But look how you
care about John Watson.

1151
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,158
Your damsel in distress.

1152
01:12:04,677 --> 01:12:09,472
You put me in a fire, for leverage?!

1153
01:12:09,473 --> 01:12:12,230
Oh, I would never let you burn,
Dr Watson.

1154
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:16,665
I had people standing by.
I'm not a murderer.

1155
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,142
Unlike your wife.

1156
01:12:25,618 --> 01:12:29,933
Let me explain how leverage works,
Dr Watson.

1157
01:12:31,372 --> 01:12:33,729
For those who understand
these things,

1158
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:37,686
Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful
man in the country.

1159
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,883
Well, apart from me.

1160
01:12:41,363 --> 01:12:45,998
Mycroft's pressure point is his
junkie detective brother, Sherlock.

1161
01:12:45,999 --> 01:12:48,956
Sherlock's pressure point
is his best friend, John Watson.

1162
01:12:48,956 --> 01:12:51,833
John Watson's pressure
point is his wife.

1163
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:55,069
I own John Watson's wife,
I own Mycroft.

1164
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,946
He's what I'm getting for Christmas.

1165
01:13:00,425 --> 01:13:02,063
It's an exchange, not a gift.

1166
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,458
Forgive me, but...

1167
01:13:09,776 --> 01:13:11,814
I already seem to have it.

1168
01:13:11,814 --> 01:13:13,332
It's password protected.

1169
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:19,727
In return for the password,
you will give me any material

1170
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:22,844
in your possession pertaining to the
woman I know as Mary Watson.

1171
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:27,879
Oh, she's bad, that one.
So many dead people.

1172
01:13:27,879 --> 01:13:30,516
You should see what I've seen.
I don't need to see it.

1173
01:13:30,517 --> 01:13:34,273
You might enjoy it, though.
I enjoy it.

1174
01:13:36,392 --> 01:13:38,391
Then why don't you show us?

1175
01:13:38,391 --> 01:13:40,910
Show you Appledore?
The secret vaults.

1176
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:43,550
Is that what you want?

1177
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:47,870
I want everything you've
got on Mary.

1178
01:13:56,111 --> 01:14:00,270
You know, I honestly expected
something good.

1179
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:04,909
Oh, I think you'll find the contents of
that laptop... Include a GPS locator.

1180
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:07,829
By now your brother will
have noticed the theft

1181
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:11,709
and the security services will be
converging on this house.

1182
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:15,629
Having arrived, they'll find
top-secret information in my hands

1183
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:19,269
and they have every justification
to search my vaults.

1184
01:14:19,269 --> 01:14:21,868
They will discover further
information of this kind

1185
01:14:21,869 --> 01:14:23,788
and I will be imprisoned.

1186
01:14:23,789 --> 01:14:28,348
You would be exonerated and restored
to your smelly little apartment

1187
01:14:28,349 --> 01:14:31,108
to solve crimes with
Mr and Mrs Psychopath.

1188
01:14:33,109 --> 01:14:36,668
Mycroft has been looking for this
opportunity for a long time.

1189
01:14:38,748 --> 01:14:41,507
He'll be a very, very proud
big brother.

1190
01:14:43,028 --> 01:14:45,947
The fact that you know it's going to
happen isn't going to stop it.

1191
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:50,747
Then why am I smiling? Ask me.

1192
01:14:52,108 --> 01:14:53,627
Why are you smiling?

1193
01:14:55,148 --> 01:14:58,627
Because Sherlock Holmes has made
one enormous mistake,

1194
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:02,026
which will destroy
the lives of everyone he loves.

1195
01:15:03,947 --> 01:15:05,706
And everything he holds dear.

1196
01:15:09,347 --> 01:15:13,306
Let me show you
the Appledore vaults.

1197
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,385
The entrance to my vaults.

1198
01:15:28,386 --> 01:15:30,265
This is where I keep you all.

1199
01:15:43,945 --> 01:15:46,184
OK, so where are the vaults, then?

1200
01:15:46,185 --> 01:15:51,264
Vaults? What vaults? There are no
vaults beneath this building.

1201
01:15:54,105 --> 01:15:55,704
They're all in here.

1202
01:15:57,704 --> 01:16:01,143
The Appledore vaults
are my mind palace.

1203
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:04,703
You know about mind palaces,
don't you, Sherlock?

1204
01:16:04,704 --> 01:16:09,783
How to store information so you
never forget it, by picturing it.

1205
01:16:09,784 --> 01:16:16,503
I just sit here, I close my eyes
and down I go to my vaults.

1206
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,182
I can go anywhere inside my vaults.

1207
01:16:24,783 --> 01:16:26,142
My memories.

1208
01:16:32,623 --> 01:16:35,422
I'll look at the files
on Mrs Watson.

1209
01:16:43,862 --> 01:16:44,981
Hmm.

1210
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:49,421
Oh, this is one of my favourites.

1211
01:16:49,422 --> 01:16:51,621
Oh, it's so exciting.

1212
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:57,701
All those wet jobs for the CIA.

1213
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:03,300
Ooh, she's gone a bit freelance now,
bad girl.

1214
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,540
Oh, she's so wicked.

1215
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:16,940
I can really see why you like her.

1216
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,019
You see?

1217
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:28,219
So there are no documents, you don't
actually have anything here?

1218
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,019
Oh, sometimes
I send out for something,

1219
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,739
if I really need it,
but mostly I just remember it all.

1220
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,859
I don't understand.

1221
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:37,699
You should have that on a T-shirt.
You just remember it all?

1222
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:42,499
It's all about knowledge,
everything is. Knowing is owning.

1223
01:17:42,499 --> 01:17:44,658
But if you just know it,
then you don't have proof.

1224
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:47,378
Proof? What would I need proof for?

1225
01:17:47,379 --> 01:17:49,498
I'm in news, you moron.

1226
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:52,578
I don't have to prove it,
I just have to print it.

1227
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:54,498
Speaking of news...

1228
01:17:54,499 --> 01:17:57,378
You'll both be heavily
featured tomorrow.

1229
01:17:57,379 --> 01:17:59,738
Trying to sell state secrets to me.

1230
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:01,777
Tut tut.

1231
01:18:03,298 --> 01:18:06,937
Let's go outside.
They'll be here shortly.

1232
01:18:06,938 --> 01:18:08,737
Can't wait to see you arrested.

1233
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:12,817
Sherlock, do we have a plan?

1234
01:18:14,098 --> 01:18:15,417
Sherlock?

1235
01:18:27,817 --> 01:18:30,856
They're taking their time,
aren't they?

1236
01:18:30,857 --> 01:18:32,296
I still don't understand.

1237
01:18:32,297 --> 01:18:34,456
And there's the back of the T-shirt.

1238
01:18:34,457 --> 01:18:37,776
You just know things -
how does that work?

1239
01:18:37,777 --> 01:18:41,376
I just love your little soldier
face. I'd like to punch it.

1240
01:18:41,376 --> 01:18:43,735
Bring it over here a minute.

1241
01:18:43,736 --> 01:18:47,455
Come on. For Mary.
Bring me your face.

1242
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:56,815
Lean forward a bit
and stick your face out.

1243
01:18:59,055 --> 01:19:01,854
Please.

1244
01:19:01,855 --> 01:19:04,934
Now, can I flick it?

1245
01:19:04,935 --> 01:19:09,854
Look at me. Can I flick your face?

1246
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:22,174
I just love doing this.
I could do it all day.

1247
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,453
Well, it works like this, John.

1248
01:19:24,454 --> 01:19:26,613
I know who Mary hurt and killed.

1249
01:19:28,094 --> 01:19:30,613
I know where to find
people who hate her.

1250
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:36,093
I know where they live,
I know their phone numbers.

1251
01:19:39,373 --> 01:19:42,252
All in my mind palace, all of it.

1252
01:19:42,253 --> 01:19:47,652
I could phone them right now
and tear your whole life down...

1253
01:19:48,733 --> 01:19:50,852
...and I will,

1254
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:54,252
unless you let me flick your face.

1255
01:20:01,812 --> 01:20:03,331
This is what I do to people.

1256
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,411
This is what I do to
whole countries.

1257
01:20:07,852 --> 01:20:10,171
Just because I know.

1258
01:20:12,132 --> 01:20:13,291
Can I do your eye now?

1259
01:20:14,572 --> 01:20:16,371
See if you can keep it open, hmm?

1260
01:20:17,572 --> 01:20:19,531
Come on, for Mary. Keep it open.

1261
01:20:19,531 --> 01:20:20,850
Sherlock?

1262
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:23,850
Let him. I'm sorry, just... let him.

1263
01:20:25,491 --> 01:20:27,210
Hmm? Come on, eye open.

1264
01:20:32,091 --> 01:20:34,410
It's difficult, isn't it?

1265
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:38,930
Janine managed to once.
She makes the funniest noises.

1266
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:51,969
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man.

1267
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:54,129
Here we go, Mr Holmes.

1268
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:58,369
To clarify, Appledore's vaults only
exist in your mind,

1269
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:00,529
nowhere else, just there?

1270
01:21:00,529 --> 01:21:02,768
They're not real,
they never have been.

1271
01:21:02,769 --> 01:21:07,168
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
step away!

1272
01:21:07,169 --> 01:21:10,088
It's fine, they're harmless.

1273
01:21:10,089 --> 01:21:12,768
'Target is not armed,
I repeat target is not armed.'

1274
01:21:12,769 --> 01:21:14,048
Sherlock, what do we do?

1275
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:17,128
Nothing. There is
nothing to be done.

1276
01:21:17,129 --> 01:21:20,968
Oh, I'm not a villain,
I have no evil plan.

1277
01:21:20,968 --> 01:21:25,687
I'm a businessman, acquiring assets.
You happen to be one of them.

1278
01:21:25,688 --> 01:21:29,607
Sorry, no chance for you to be
a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

1279
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:35,167
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man. Do it now!

1280
01:21:35,168 --> 01:21:37,287
Oh, do your research.

1281
01:21:38,368 --> 01:21:42,447
I'm not a hero,
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

1282
01:21:42,447 --> 01:21:44,406
Merry Christmas!

1283
01:21:45,487 --> 01:21:47,566
'Man down, man down.'

1284
01:21:47,567 --> 01:21:49,686
Get away from me,
John! Stay well back!

1285
01:21:49,687 --> 01:21:51,686
Christ, Sherlock!

1286
01:21:51,687 --> 01:21:54,846
Don't fire! Do not
fire on Sherlock Holmes!

1287
01:21:54,847 --> 01:21:56,846
Do not fire!

1288
01:21:58,487 --> 01:21:59,726
Oh Christ, Sherlock!

1289
01:22:03,326 --> 01:22:08,965
Give my love to Mary.
Tell her she's safe now.

1290
01:22:38,365 --> 01:22:39,404
Oh, Sherlock.

1291
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:43,123
What have you done?

1292
01:22:53,004 --> 01:22:55,283
As my colleague is
fond of remarking,

1293
01:22:55,284 --> 01:22:58,523
this country sometimes needs
a blunt instrument.

1294
01:22:58,524 --> 01:23:01,283
Equally,
it sometimes needs a dagger,

1295
01:23:01,283 --> 01:23:05,642
a scalpel wielded with precision
and without remorse.

1296
01:23:07,803 --> 01:23:12,322
There will always come a time
when we need Sherlock Holmes.

1297
01:23:12,323 --> 01:23:16,442
If this is some expression
of familial sentiment...

1298
01:23:16,443 --> 01:23:17,642
Don't be absurd.

1299
01:23:17,643 --> 01:23:20,682
I am not given to
outbursts of brotherly compassion.

1300
01:23:22,602 --> 01:23:25,561
You know what
happened to the other one.

1301
01:23:25,562 --> 01:23:29,281
In any event, there is no prison in
which we could incarcerate Sherlock

1302
01:23:29,282 --> 01:23:32,641
without causing a riot
on a daily basis.

1303
01:23:32,642 --> 01:23:38,361
The alternative, however,
would require your approval.

1304
01:23:38,362 --> 01:23:40,281
Hardly merciful, Mr Holmes.

1305
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:45,419
Regrettably, Lady Smallwood,
my brother is a murderer.

1306
01:23:58,545 --> 01:24:00,953
You will look after him for me,
won't you?

1307
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:04,083
Hmm. Don't worry.
I'll keep him in trouble.

1308
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:06,210
That's my girl.

1309
01:24:11,268 --> 01:24:14,559
Since this is likely to be the last
conversation I'll have with John Watson,

1310
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,486
would you mind if we took a moment?

1311
01:24:25,558 --> 01:24:27,243
So here we are.

1312
01:24:29,371 --> 01:24:31,297
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.

1313
01:24:31,298 --> 01:24:32,421
Sorry?

1314
01:24:32,421 --> 01:24:34,949
That's the whole of it.
If you're looking for baby names.

1315
01:24:36,275 --> 01:24:39,124
No, we've had a scan,
we're pretty sure it's a girl.

1316
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:40,529
Oh. OK.

1317
01:24:45,788 --> 01:24:47,753
Yeah.

1318
01:24:47,753 --> 01:24:50,360
You know, actually, I can't
think of a single thing to say.

1319
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,723
No, neither can I.

1320
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:54,772
The game is over.

1321
01:24:54,773 --> 01:24:57,661
The game is never over, John.

1322
01:24:57,661 --> 01:24:59,706
But there may be some
new players now.

1323
01:24:59,707 --> 01:25:03,277
That's OK, the East Wind takes us
all in the end. What's that?

1324
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:07,528
It's a story my brother told me
when we were kids.

1325
01:25:07,529 --> 01:25:12,061
The East Wind is a terrifying force
that lays waste to all in its path.

1326
01:25:12,061 --> 01:25:15,510
It seeks out the unworthy
and plucks them from the earth.

1327
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:16,714
That was generally me.

1328
01:25:16,715 --> 01:25:19,161
Nice(!)
He's a rubbish big brother.

1329
01:25:20,606 --> 01:25:25,660
So what about you, then?
Where are you actually going now?

1330
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,267
Oh, some undercover
work in Eastern Europe.

1331
01:25:28,267 --> 01:25:29,670
For how long?

1332
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:34,885
Six months, my brother estimates.
He's never wrong.

1333
01:25:34,886 --> 01:25:35,969
And then what?

1334
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:40,581
Who knows?

1335
01:25:46,839 --> 01:25:52,695
John, there's something I should
say, I've meant to say always

1336
01:25:52,696 --> 01:25:54,140
and I never have.

1337
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:58,071
Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet
again, I might as well say it now.

1338
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:04,047
Sherlock is actually a girl's name.

1339
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:08,655
It's not.

1340
01:26:08,655 --> 01:26:09,852
It was worth a try.

1341
01:26:09,852 --> 01:26:12,087
We're not naming our daughter
after you.

1342
01:26:12,088 --> 01:26:13,604
Oh, I think it could work.

1343
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:22,066
To the very best of times, John.

1344
01:27:09,086 --> 01:27:11,640
'Smith brings it inside.
This looks good.

1345
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:14,594
'Cassandra comes in for a shot.
Ooh, he missed it!'

1346
01:27:16,031 --> 01:27:20,182
Oi, there's something wrong with the telly.
There's something wrong with the telly, mate.

1347
01:27:22,138 --> 01:27:23,694
Who's that?

1348
01:27:23,695 --> 01:27:25,251
Did you miss me?

1349
01:27:25,252 --> 01:27:28,485
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

1350
01:27:28,485 --> 01:27:30,161
How is this possible?

1351
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,994
We don't know, but it's on every
screen in the country.

1352
01:27:32,995 --> 01:27:34,471
Every screen simultaneously.

1353
01:27:34,472 --> 01:27:36,387
Has the Prime Minister been told?

1354
01:27:38,384 --> 01:27:39,741
And Mycroft?

1355
01:27:39,741 --> 01:27:42,814
But that's not possible. That is
simply not possible.

1356
01:27:45,728 --> 01:27:48,961
What's happened?
Sir? It's your brother.

1357
01:27:51,955 --> 01:27:53,032
Mycroft?

1358
01:27:53,033 --> 01:27:55,467
'Hello, little brother.
How's the exile going?'

1359
01:27:55,467 --> 01:27:56,943
I've only been gone four minutes.

1360
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:59,139
Well, I certainly hope you've
learnt your lesson.

1361
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,973
'As it turns out, you're needed.'

1362
01:28:01,974 --> 01:28:04,089
Oh, for God's sake,
make up your mind!

1363
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:06,444
Who needs me this time?

1364
01:28:06,444 --> 01:28:10,036
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

1365
01:28:10,036 --> 01:28:13,628
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?'

1366
01:28:13,629 --> 01:28:15,185
England.

1367
01:28:15,186 --> 01:28:17,770
But he's dead. I mean, you told me
he was dead, Moriarty?

1368
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:19,639
Absolutely. Blew his own brains out.

1369
01:28:19,639 --> 01:28:21,627
So how can he be back?

1370
01:28:21,628 --> 01:28:25,882
Well if he is,
he'd better wrap up warm.

1371
01:28:27,712 --> 01:28:29,342
There's an East Wind coming.

1372
01:29:05,848 --> 01:29:07,478
Miss me?

1373
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
