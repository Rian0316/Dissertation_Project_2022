1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,930
孩子们  你们还记得 我和罗宾的第一次约会...
Kids, you remember my first day with Robin.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,490
- 我好像是爱上你了 - 什么?
- I think I'm in love with you. - What?!

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,320
可是正常人... 也就是不像你爸爸的人
Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,990
一般晚一点才说出一句"我爱你"
usually take longer to say "I love you."

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,180
罗宾倒经过了正常的阶段...
Robin went through the usual stages.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,150
- 蜘蛛!蜘蛛! - 我什么东西忘走廊里了
- Spider! Spider! - I left something in the hallway.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,220
- 蜘蛛在哪? - 就在那
- Where? - Right there.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,020
抓到啦
Got it.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,460
刚开始你会想到你真的爱他
First there's the moment when you think you think it.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,860
还没死
Whoa, still alive.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,930
有一瞬间 你会认为你知道你爱他
There's the moment you think you know it.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,580
你最好还是别亲我 你也会病的
Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,340
完全值得
Totally worth it.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,260
不久你会肯定你是爱他的 可是你不能告诉他
There's the moment where you know you know it,  but you can't yet say it.

15
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,130
现在太晚了  明天再聊
All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,510
晚安
Good night.

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,950
晚安
Good night.

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,130
泰德  等会儿
Wait, Ted?

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,970
什么事?
Yeah?

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,700
晚安
Good night.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,060
行  那到时候见
Well, great, I'll see you then.

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,410
再见  甜心
Bye, sweetie.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,800
泰德  你猜谁会来?
Hey. Guess what?

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,780
我妹妹凯蒂下周末来看我...
My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend.

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,000
飞机星期四到
She gets in on Thursday.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,780
太好了  你知道我有什么打算?
That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do?

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,980
我星期五请假不上班...
I'm going to take off work Friday.

28
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,850
我们带她到帝国大厦参观 (纽约有名建筑物)
We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.

29
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,010
你真会这样做?
Really? You'd do that?

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,010
每个人都应该参观帝国大厦
Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,490
还有最后你知道你肯定爱上了他的时候...
And then there's the moment where you know you know it,

32
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,510
而且不能再不告诉他了
and you can't keep it in any longer.

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,100
- 泰德 - 什么?
- Ted. - Yeah?

34
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,450
肉丸 ("Falafel"是一种肉丸似的中东食品)
Falafel.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,300
- 肉丸? - 肉丸
- Falafel? - Falafel.

40
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,720
你没跟泰德说"我爱你" 反而说了"肉丸"?
Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said "falafel"?

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,360
- 我说不出来 - 我就是不能理解...
- I totally choked. - I just don't get it.

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,700
为什么你不能告诉泰德你爱他?
Why can't you tell Ted you love him?

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,580
告诉一个人我爱他 对我来说是件很难的事
Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.

44
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,150
你又不是从来没告诉过一个人你爱他
Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before.

45
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,790
不可能吧...
No.

46
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,750
听我解释  我一般 谈恋爱都没有到过这个阶段
Okay, well, I don't usually get this far in the relationship.

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,760
我一般恋爱都到 第三个星期就下高速公路了
I usually take the three-week exit.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,410
你不会真的信巴尼的"高速公路"理论!
Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,770
孩子们  好好听着 我要教你们一堂一生不忘的课
Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge.

50
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,820
谈恋爱就像一条高速公路
Relationships are like a freeway.

51
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,460
你上个月才告诉我 谈恋爱跟杂技团一样
Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.

52
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,450
可是这个比喻是新的 胜过那个...
No, this is new. This trumps that.

53
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,380
高速公路和谈恋爱一样 都有出口...
Freeways have exits. So do relationships.

54
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,130
谈恋爱的第一个出口  是在谈到六个小时的时刻 我最爱的也是这个出口
The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in.

55
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,020
两人见面  交谈  做爱 然后在她洗澡的时候下高速
You meet, you talk, you have sex, you exit when she's in the shower.

56
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,800
每一个和你做爱过的女人 都立即要洗澡?
So every girl you have sex with feels the immediate need to shower?

57
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,920
其实不用回答  我理解
Actually, yeah, I get that.

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,210
接下来的三个出口是第四天  第三个星期 和第七个月...
The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--

59
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,070
你们俩到那时就会分手 日历上记着...
that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.

60
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,790
什么?
What?

61
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,550
还有别的出口是一年半以后  十八年以后 和最后的出口  死的时候...
Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death.

62
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,630
如果你一生只跟一个女人在一起...
Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life,

63
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,020
你将会丧气地问到 "我们到了吗?"
it's like, "Are we there yet?"

64
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,580
我一辈子也没上过 这么长的高速公路...
So I've never been on the freeway this long before.

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,090
一般和一个人处了久以后 我就发现这个人的性格有毛病
I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing

66
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,780
迫不及待的上下一个出口
that makes me want to take the next exit.

67
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,930
完全理解  这事对我也发生过
Yeah, been there.

68
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,320
我以前谈过一个只能 听着古典音乐方便的人...
I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing.

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,180
这人是马修
Okay, it was Marshall.

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,470
我和泰德现在的感情这么好 我不想把它搞得更复杂
It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.

71
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,870
放心  到时候就可以克服这问题了...
Relax, it'll happen when it happens.

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,510
马修的古典音乐问题 也是这样解决的
Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.

73
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,870
凯蒂来了!
Oh, here comes Katie.

74
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,990
- 你妹妹真可爱 - 没错
- Aw, your sister's so cute. - Yeah.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,150
现在让我回忆起来 以前送她回家的时候...
This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school,

76
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,550
扎得马尾辫子 背着她的凯蒂猫书包
with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.

77
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,690
- 你好 凯蒂猫 - 糟糕了...
-  Hello, Kitty. - Oh, no.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,100
不不不  不可能
No. No. No.

79
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,780
- 罗宾  过得好吗? - 哦  好  好
- Hey, Robin. How are you? - Oh, good. Good.

80
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,790
这个...长舌头的人是谁?
So, who is this... tongue person?

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,130
罗宾  这是我的男朋友凯尔
Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.

82
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,290
看起来你们家专出美女
Looks like hotness runs in the family.

83
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,550
谢谢了 你嘴真甜
Oh, you said that. Great.

84
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,950
你们交往多久了?
So how long have you two been...?

85
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,310
- 整整两个月 - 对
- Two whole months. - Yeah.

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,650
他其实也到纽约来看家人
He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too.

87
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,740
多完美?
Isn't that great?

88
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,820
我的一个表哥 23岁 混球一个 可是他给我买啤酒  所以...
My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,890
那不错  这是我的朋友莉莉
That's cool. This is my friend Lily.

90
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,350
美女
Hot.

91
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,030
你小子嘴巴还真甜
You say things!

92
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,170
那我们回去吧  我帮你打理好
Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.

93
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,480
其实  今晚我和凯尔住
Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,500
- 不行  你今晚不会跟他住 - 求求你啦...
- Uh, no, you're not. - Oh, come on.

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,410
今晚是个特别的日子...
It's kind of a special night.

96
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,740
听懂了?
If you know what I mean.

97
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,480
什么?
What?

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,810
哦  哦...
Oh. Oh...

99
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,620
我不敢想相信 我的小妹妹会失身于一个
I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a...

100
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,720
鸡冠头的猥琐男
...douche with a faux hawk.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,460
这不能发生
This can't happen.

102
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,770
你们得帮我说服她
You guys have to help me talk her out of it.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,990
告诉一个女人不要做爱
Speech to talk a girl out of having sex.

104
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,730
从来没干过
Yeah, I don't have any of those.

105
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,660
防止婚前性交 是有违我的宗教信仰的
Discouraging premarital sex is against my religion.

106
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,790
求你啦?我是她的大姐
Please? I'm her older sister.

107
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,460
我应该教她怎么做明智的决定
I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.

108
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,100
已经两点了而且你已经 喝了三杯苏格兰威士忌了
It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.

109
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,920
正因如此 我才需要你们的帮忙
That's why I need your help.

110
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,980
第一晚  罗宾说服了她妹妹和她住
Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night.

111
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,900
第二天  我带大家去了帝国大厦
And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.

112
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,020
你们和一个建筑师来 太幸运了
You guys are lucky you came here with an architect.

113
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,810
帝国大厦趣事 第一
Empire State Building fun fact number one:

114
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,380
当1930年3月17号开始施工时...
When construction began on March 17, 1930,

115
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,530
这栋楼一个星期就建了四楼半
the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week.

116
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,280
一个星期建四楼半
Four and a half stories per week.

117
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,440
一个星期建四楼半
Four and a half stories per week.

118
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,050
这样的反应才差不多嘛
There it is. There it is. Come on.

119
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,820
这些不有趣吗 你们应该有点兴趣
These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.

120
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,900
凯蒂  我一直都想来帝国大厦的...
You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long,

121
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,610
可是我一直在等着 和一个特别的人一起来
but I waited to come here with someone special.

122
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,220
又来了
Oh, here we go.

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,860
我和马修也没来过帝国大厦
Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either.

124
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,510
可是我很高兴等了这么久 能和我的未婚夫一起干这么重要的事
But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fianc?

125
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,950
说起等  我在高中 发过誓不要过早做爱
Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school.

126
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,690
等待也非常酷
It's totally cool to wait.

127
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,760
除了大麻以外  不要碰任何毒品
And stay away from drugs... other than pot.

128
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,060
- 你告诉他们了? - 是的  我告诉了他们
- You told them? - Oh, okay, yes, I told them.

129
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,170
我只想让你 听一听别的大人的意见
But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too.

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,550
他家都觉得你应该等  对不对?
Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?

131
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,450
- 当然  你应该等 - 做爱很好玩
- Totally. You should wait. - Sex is fun.

132
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,210
看到了吗?
See?

133
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,230
你真虚伪 你16岁就失身了
You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.

134
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,500
你怎么的知道的?
Well, how do you know that?

135
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,960
你的日记忘在你的房间里了 也就是我的新房间
You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.

136
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,200
我花一万块钱买那本日记
I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.

137
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,610
我已经和凯尔拍拖了两个月
Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now.

138
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,980
久的快像是一生了
It's like forever.

139
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,420
我们别什么的都干过了
I  mean, we've already done everything else.

140
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,700
- 我们甚至连... - 哦 啦......
- I mean, we've even... - Oh. La, la, la, la, la.

141
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,690
啦...  啦...
La,  la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

142
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,470
连凯尔都能干那个
Even Kyle gets to do that.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,200
你没资格阻止我
You have no right to tell me not to do it.

144
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,530
可是和凯尔? 为什么不能等?
But Kyle? Why can't you just wait?

145
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,680
如果等的话 你会遇见一个像泰德这么好的人
Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.

146
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,150
罗宾  这会发生的
Robin, this is happening.

147
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,290
我已经发布在我的博客上了
Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page.

148
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,700
- 我要去抽一根 - 你现在也抽烟了?
- I need a clove. - You smoke now, too?

149
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,970
- 记得以前吗? - 不!
- Oh, remember cloves? - No!

150
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,220
不要说"记得以前吗?" 这不行
No "Aw, remember cloves?" This can't happen.

151
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,950
她还是我的妹妹  明白吗?
She's my baby sister, okay?

152
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,850
她应该在看"美人鱼" 喝果汁而不是跟凯尔鬼混
She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sex.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,980
可是你失去处女之身时也不就是16岁
Come on, you were only 16 when you had sex.

154
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,850
- 我当时17岁 - 我们是18岁的时候
- I was 17. - We were 18.

155
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,600
巴尼应该是12岁左右
Barney was probably 12.

156
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,660
泰德  玩笑开得好
Good one, Ted.

157
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,060
我当时是13...16...14...
I was, uh, six... fourt...

158
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,660
你当时多大?
How old were you again?

159
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,320
-伙计  我也是
17
- 17. - Dude, me, too.

160
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,170
- 巴尼  你没事吧? - 当然没有
- Barney, you okay? - Yeah, of course.

161
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,580
怎么  你不相信我?
What, you don't believe me?

162
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,860
- 我当时在夏令营  所以我... - 什么夏令营?
- It was at camp, so I'm... - What camp?

163
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,280
在郊外的一个地方  你拿地图找
This place in the Catskills. Look it up.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,250
我那年在那教课
I was there teaching for the summer.

165
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,210
你教什么课?
What did you teach?

166
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,150
舞蹈
Uh, dance.

167
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,300
舞蹈?
Dance?

168
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,820
对泰德  舞蹈  也许你听说过...
Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it.

169
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,950
原本只是一份简单的夏日工 结果变成了...
It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more.

170
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,680
她的名字叫弗朗西斯 可是大家都叫她"宝贝"
Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.

171
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,820
塞尔娃
# Sylvia #

172
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,260
米奇  什么事?
# Yes, Mickey? #

173
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,470
你管你的宝贝叫什么?
# How you call your loverboy? #

174
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,860
来这  宝贝
# Come here, loverboy #

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,810
如果他不回答
# And if he doesn't answer #

176
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,380
哦  宝贝
# Oh, loverboy #

177
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,550
如果他还是不回答?
# And if he still doesn't answer? #

178
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,330
我简单的说  宝贝儿
# I simply say, baby... #

179
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,940
宝贝
# Oh, baby #

180
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,100
我甜蜜的宝贝儿
# My sweet baby #

181
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,300
那是"风骚舞蹈" (电视节目)
That's Dirty Dancing.

182
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,600
- 昨晚电视上播了 - 不对 是两晚前
- It was on last night. - No, it was two nights ago.

183
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,100
"她像一阵风" 已经在我的脑海里 回荡了四十个小时了
"She's Like the Wind" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours.

184
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,890
我刚忘了  又想起了
I just got it out. Now it's back in.

185
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,150
该死的斯威泽 (Patrick Swayze热舞十七男主角演员)
Damn you, Swayze!

186
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,640
- 记得我们的第一次? - 记得
- Do you remember our first time? - Yeah.

187
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,910
是上大学的时候
It was back in college.

188
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,540
等一等
Oh, wait, wait.

189
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,760
我很想干这个  可是...
Look... I really want to do this, but...

190
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,310
你不觉得我们应该 把我们的第一次变得特别?
we should make it special, you know?

191
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,580
得干的到位
Do this right.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
好
Okay.

193
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,040
我同意
You're right.

194
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,440
也许周末可以到海边租栋别墅
Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.

195
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,810
或者新年前夕
Yeah, New Year's Eve.

196
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,390
好
Okay.

197
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,440
我们还可以点一些蜡烛 放古典音乐
Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.

198
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,970
我不喜欢那个主意
That's not a good idea.

199
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,400
为什么?
Why not?

200
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,940
很难解释
Long story.

201
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,110
可是我们可以听艾尔・格林的音乐 还可以一起泡澡
But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.

202
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,860
听起来是个好主意
Oh, yeah, that sounds so good.

203
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,320
我爱你  马修
Oh, I love you, Marshall.

204
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,810
我很高兴我们没那么性急
I'm so glad we're waiting.

205
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,650
12分钟后...

206
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:33,741
Oops.

207
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,180
- 那真可爱 - 告诉她接下来怎么了
- Oh, that's adorable. - Yeah, tell her what happened next.

208
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
- 那爽的不可思议 - 是呀
- That was amazing. - Yeah.

209
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,680
要再干一次?
Want to do it again?

210
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,080
求你们别了
Please don't.

211
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,000
- 我们道了谦 - 真的嘛  为什么又干了一次?
- We said we were sorry. - Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,170
我把我的随身听借给你了
You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.

213
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,290
反正意思是  不管怎么样 第一次都不会是想象得那么完美
The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.

214
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,570
我的第一次非常糟糕
Well, mine was terrible.

215
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,700
等等  你还一直没告诉我过
Wait, I've never heard your story.

216
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,380
如你所知  我当时16岁
Well, as you know, I was 16.

217
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,140
是和我当时的男朋友 布莱恩  一起干的
And it was with my boyfriend Brian.

218
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,770
- 准备好了吗? - 好了
- Ready? - Yeah.

219
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,780
- 这气氛真好 - 我知道
- This feels so right. - Oh, I know.

220
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,530
- 罗宾 - 布莱恩
- Oh, Robin. - Oh, Brian.

221
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,010
对了  我是同性恋
Yeah, I'm gay.

222
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,450
- 我真为你感到痛苦 - 算了  我应该早就看出来了
- I'm so sorry. - Eh, I should've known.

223
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,640
有一些前兆
There were signs.

224
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,470
老天啊!
Oh, my God!

225
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,000
我妈回来了  赶快!
My mom's home. Quick!

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,790
- 躲到我床底下 - 什么?!
- Get under my bed. - What?!

227
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,700
老天啊!
Oh, my God!

228
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,220
你只有一个失去处女之身的机会
You only get one shot at losing your virginity.

229
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,090
虽然我只是干了一丁点 但也算...
And even though I just barely had sex, it counts.

230
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:48,963
What do you mean just barely?

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,890
比方说 他没跳到 游泳池的底下去  可是他...
Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he...

232
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,470
在浅的那一头玩了一下水
splashed around in the shallow end.

233
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,870
那样的话 他不算是你的第一次
Then you didn't lose your virginity to him.

234
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,470
- 一丁点不算 - 一丁点也算
- Just barely doesn't count. - Yes, it does.

235
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,690
- 不算 - 也算
- No, it doesn't. - Yes, it does.

236
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,800
不  不算 一丁点不算  争论解决了
No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.

237
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,940
莉莉  你这个小妖精
Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot.

238
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,870
是不是在马修游泳之前 有别人试了水?
Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,780
不  没有别人试过水  对吗?
No. Nobody else tested the water, right?

240
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,510
难道是史古特?
Scooter?

241
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,610
史古特是谁?
Who's Scooter?

242
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,170
我在高中的男朋友 我和他绝对没有过
My high school boyfriend, who I did not have sex with.

243
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,720
我...我不敢相信
I... I can't believe this.

244
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,140
我们可是马修和莉莉 别人看见我们会说
We're Marshall and Lily-- when people see us, they say,

245
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,320
"哦  看看他们 他们只跟对方上过床"
"Oh, look at them, they've only had sex with each other."

246
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
不  马修  人们其实说 "哦  看看他们"
No, Marshall, they say, "Oh, look at them,

247
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,320
他们只跟对方有过性交
they've only had sex with each other."

248
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,660
可是那不是真的了
But now that's not true anymore--

249
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,760
你上过床的人是我的两倍
now you've had sex with twice as many people as I have.

250
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,020
我一直就觉得 你在床上的技术太好了
I knew that you were too good at it.

251
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,100
知道吗? 我根本 不要看愚蠢的帝国大厦了
Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.

252
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,960
- 帝国大厦不愚蠢 - 我要去看凯尔
- It's not stupid. - I'm going to see Kyle.

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,610
凯蒂  求求你了 你只有一个失去处女之身的机会
Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once.

254
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,110
你应该留给某个特别的人
You should only be having sex with someone who's special.

255
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,800
你跟一百多个人有了性交
Oh, please-- you've had sex with, like, a hundred guys.

256
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,100
没有一百个  没有一百个!
It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.

257
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,720
我肯定你跟他们每一个都非常相爱
I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.

258
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,980
我对每一个都有不同的感情...
I had different levels of feeling for each of the...

259
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,100
其实是个非常合理的数字
very  reasonable number of guys.

260
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,850
真的
Really.

261
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,810
那么  你爱泰德吗?
Well, do you love Ted?

262
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,080
你爱他吗?
Do you love Ted ?

263
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,210
我...
I, um...

264
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,120
帝国大厦趣事第二十二
Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22:

265
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,440
帝国大厦有很多 人们可以私下谈话的地方
The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations.

266
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,330
- 你不用回答  好吗? - 就让我解释
- You're off the hook, okay? - Just let me explain.

267
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,880
你不用作任何解释 你不用说出来  没事
You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.

268
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,580
好  可是如果谈恋爱 像条高速公路的话  那么...
Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying...

269
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,110
"嗯嗯嗯" 就像 进入共车道一样
"hm hm hm" is like... getting into the carpool lane.

270
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,870
而我不想下这道高速  可是...
And  I don't want to take an exit, but...

271
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,970
我还没有进入共车道的准备
at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane.

272
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,710
知道在共车道里有什么吗?
Because what's in the carpool lane?

273
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,790
那有一颗大钻石 可是我还不愿意结...
Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...

274
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,590
好  罗宾  别说了
Okay, Robin, Robin, stop.

275
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,190
这没什么大惊小怪的 你不用说出来
It's no big deal-- you don't have to say it.

276
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,510
说出来是个大事 我不想说得太早
It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.

277
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,170
怎么啦?你是说 像我说得那么早吗?
What, you mean like I did?

278
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,710
不  我没说...
No. I didn't...

279
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,060
对啊 你是有点早
Yeah, like you did.

280
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,560
可是  泰德  你也得承认 你那么早就说出来有点怪怪的
I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.

281
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,380
- 奇怪...还是大胆? - 蛮奇怪是肯定的
- Weird... or courageous? - Pretty sure weird.

282
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,510
谁第一次约会就说出来?
I mean, who gives it up on the first date?

283
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,800
可是表现出我 勇敢得跟一个骑士一样
Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.

284
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,300
不  显示出你 是个爱说我爱你的浪子
No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.

285
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,320
那么你就是个 不说我爱你的吝啬鬼
Well, then you're an I-love-you prude.

286
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,920
算了  我把它收回来
You know what? I take mine back.

287
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,500
- 你...什么? - 我把我的"我爱你"收回来
- You... What? - I take my "I love you" back.

288
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,140
- 你不能说收就收 - 才不呢  我刚收回来了
- You can't take it back. - Nah. Just did. Got it right here.

289
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,310
既然我是个浪子 我干脆跟谁都说
But, you know, I'm such a slut, I'm just gonna give it away.

290
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,430
你  这位先生  我爱你
Hey, you, sir. I love you.

291
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,160
真得很感谢
Thank you, man.

292
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,290
我原本是要上楼跳下去的
I was going up there to jump.

293
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,510
马修  为什么你这么看重它
Marshall, why is this such a big deal?

294
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,920
为什么这么看重
Why is this such a big deal?

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,620
对不起 哥伦布 猜猜谁真的发现了北美洲?
Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World.

296
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,130
一个叫史古特的小子
Some dude named Scooter.

297
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,500
尼尔・阿姆斯特朗 其实是这样说的
Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this:

298
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,540
这是一个人的一小步 却是史古特的一大步
"One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter."

299
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,710
亚当 猜猜谁在你之前...
Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve

300
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,200
- 跟夏娃有了性交? - 好的  马修  我理解了
- before you did... - Okay, Marshall, I get it.

301
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,660
这之所以重要 因为我们的会因此历史而重写
It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.

302
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,890
不  不用
No, it doesn't.

303
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,780
这么说  你来过帝国大厦?
Look, have you been to the Empire State Building?

304
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,990
没有  你只来过第一楼的大厅
No. You've only been in the lobby.

305
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,270
人们买票的目的不是进入大厅
People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby.

306
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,600
买票的人都要到顶上去
They buy tickets to get to the top.

307
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,970
史古特只到过大厅 而大厅不算..
Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.

308
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,900
真的?
Really.

309
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,250
您能告诉我怎么到帝国大厦?
Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?

310
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,200
我们现在就在帝国大厦里面
Um, we're in it right now.

311
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,000
谢谢你  先生 你是个非常聪明的人
Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.

312
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,840
你没错
You're right.

313
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,760
我为什么要把一切都抛弃掉?
Why would I throw that all away?

314
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,150
今天真美好
I'm having the best day!

315
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,380
我得承认也许我没资格...
Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place

316
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,600
在与感情有关的 问题上教训你  可是...
to lecture you on romantic relationships, but...

317
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,870
我真的不想 看到你跟我犯一样的错误
but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.

318
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,500
- 相信我  凯尔不是同性恋 - 我说的不是那个意思
- Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay. - That's not what I meant.

319
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,570
我只希望你没有这么急着长大
I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up.

320
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,540
求你不要和凯尔上床
Please don't do this.

321
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,080
可是  孩子们 凯蒂却和凯尔上了床
But, kids, later that night, Katie did it,

322
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,000
她怀了孕  生了四胞胎
and she got pregnant... with quintuplets...

323
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,100
余生住在一个破房子里
and she lived out her days in a trailer park...

324
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,490
死的时候还是个酒鬼
where she died an alcoholic.

325
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,040
孩子们  这个故事的寓意是 在结婚之前  决不能有性交
So the moral here, kids, don't have sex until you're married.

326
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,090
甚至  等到结了一两年婚以后
Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.

327
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,290
- 老爸! - 拜托 到底发生了什么?
- Dad! - Come on, what really happened?

328
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,370
好吧  说真的
All right, here's what really happened.

329
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:31,660
- Hey. - Hey.

330
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,270
她没有干
She didn't do it.

331
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,490
太好了!看来你说的话她听进去了
Hey, that's great! You got through to her.

332
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,920
我的话没进去  你的进了
No, I didn't. You did.

333
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,900
她告诉我 你和她谈了一会
She told me that you talked to her.

334
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:41,952
Hey, Katie.

335
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:43,480
Hey.

336
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,400
还有帝国大厦趣事要说?
Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?

337
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,290
没了 我可不想 让你无聊的听我解释
No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours

338
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,660
这幢102层的大楼是 如何在700万小时内建成
it took to build this 102-story testament to human will.

339
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,220
你没事吧?
So, you okay?

340
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,570
我不知道为什么 大家都大惊小怪的
I don't know what everyone is freaking out about.

341
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,930
凯尔是个很好的人
Kyle, he's a really nice guy.

342
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,300
他有机会和我的朋友葛蕾晨 在实验室胡搞 可是他没有
He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't.

343
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,300
因为他说他知道我会发现
'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.

344
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,060
这听起来很坦率
That's very gallant.

345
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,850
我也不知道为什么 你姐姐把这事看得这么重
Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either.

346
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,000
- 我第一次的时候 跟你一样大 - 真的么?
- I was your age my first time. - Oh, really?

347
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,640
没错  是和这个叫莫利的女孩
Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.

348
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,290
我爱你  泰德
I love you, Ted.

349
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,640
莫利  我也爱你
Oh, I love you, too, Molly.

350
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,050
可是我没有爱她
But I didn't.

351
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,150
那太爽了
That  was amazing.

352
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,050
对不起  我得走了
Look, I got to go.

353
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,450
你去哪?
Where are you going?

354
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,250
我的表哥从墨西哥搞了些爆竹
My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico.

355
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,530
我们要去林子里点一些  很好玩
We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.

356
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,140
你会打电话给我吗?
Well, will you call me?

357
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,430
当然  我一定会打给你
Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.

358
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,560
可是我一直没给她打电话
But I didn't.

359
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,750
莫利?
Molly?

360
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100

361
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,860
可以借我二十块钱吗?我一定还
Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.

362
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,820
可是我没还
But I didn't.

363
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,930
我以后见都没见过她了
And I never saw her again.

364
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,480
我告诉她我爱她 可是...我只想要做爱
I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have sex.

365
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,270
我说什么都行 只要能和她鬼混
I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and...

366
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,090
而我就那么作了
that's exactly what I did.

367
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,100
我不想告诉你怎么做
Look, I'm not telling you what to do.

368
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,230
我只是想让你知道 十七岁的男孩是什么样的
I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like.

369
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,400
连"好人"也不例外
Even the nice ones.

370
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,670
我告诉凯尔我想等... 他就把我甩了
So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.

371
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,410
我好抱歉
Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

372
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,240
甜心
Aw, honey.

373
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,530
我保证一切都会好起来的
I promise everything is gonna be okay.

374
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,560
你想不想看"美人鱼" 喝果汁?
You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?

375
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,160
你得在果汁里放一大勺糖
Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.

376
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,450
别告诉妈妈
Don't tell Mom.

377
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,420
谢谢你
Thanks for doing that.

378
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,090
不用谢  我知道 对你来说这事意义很深
You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.

379
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,540
你的故事里面的你一点都不像你
But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.

380
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,960
嗯...
Yeah, well...

395
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,210
我说出来了
I said it.

396
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,180
感觉真好
Feels right.

397
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,210
- 我爱你 - 我是个同性恋
- I love you. - I'm gay.

398
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,130
开个玩笑
I'm kidding.

399
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,260
我也爱你
I love you, too.

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,150
你的"我爱你"处女说 没了
Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.

401
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
嗯
Yeah.

402
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,490
我想我只是在等到个够格的男人吧
I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.

403
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,400
凯蒂最后在纽约玩得很开心
Katie ended up having a great first time in New York.

404
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,640
在她回家之前 我们以又去了一次帝国大厦
And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.

405
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,910
我很高兴我们终于一起来了
I am so glad we're finally doing this.

406
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,490
你说什么屁话呢? 我们昨天才来的这
What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.

407
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,070
是啊  可是那不算数
Yeah, but that didn't really count.

408
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,600
- 哦  惨了 - 对
- Oh, crap. - Exactly!

409
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,840
那么昨天我们不算来过这里
So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building.

410
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,280
那么说马修你是我的第一次
So I lost it to you, Marshall.

411
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,230
而我乘那个电梯到了顶头...
And I rode that elevator to the top,

412
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,490
看到了美丽的风景 而我也沉醉其中
and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness.

413
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,440
那才是我们的故事
And that's our story.

414
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,010
对  对  那是我们的故事
Yeah. Yeah, that's our story.

415
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,180
我们只跟对方做过爱
We've only had sex with each other.

416
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,260
我们只跟对方做过爱
We've only had sex with each other.

417
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,600
他们只跟对方有过性交
They've only had sex with each other.

418
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,540
好了  大家一起进去
Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go.
