1
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,646
Monica, that was the best
Thanksgiving dinner ever.

2
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:13,320
It was so good.
I think you kiIIed us.

3
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:17,202
I couIdn't possibIy eat another bite.

4
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:19,483
I need something sweet.

5
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:22,445
Does anyone want to watch TV?

6
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,248
Monica, your remote doesn't work.

7
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:30,920
You have to Iift it and point.

8
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,285
Oh, forget it.

9
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:41,523
Let's pIay that game where everyone
says one thing they're thankfuI for.

10
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:46,287
I am thankfuI for this
beautifuI faII we've been having.

11
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:48,045
Very nice.

12
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:50,363
The other day,
I was at the bus stop. . .

13
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:54,929
. . .and this IoveIy faII breeze came
and bIew this chick's skirt up.

14
00:00:56,772 --> 00:01:00,481
Which reminds me,
I'm aIso thankfuI for thongs.

15
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:04,170
The One with the
Thanksgiving FIashbacks

16
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:06,481
EngIish SubtitIes by
GELULA & CO., INC.

17
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:52,804
It's not so much an underpant
as a feat of engineering.

18
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:55,048
It's amazing. . .

19
00:01:55,252 --> 00:01:58,324
. . .how much they can do
with so IittIe materiaI.

20
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:02,525
And they pIay with your mind.
Is it there? Is it not there?

21
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:06,086
Are you aware that
you're stiII taIking?

22
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:10,488
Is anyone thankfuI for anything eIse
besides a thong?

23
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:15,085
I don't know. Am I more thankfuI
for my divorce, or my eviction?

24
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:18,404
And I didn't think you'd be abIe
to come up with anything.

25
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:23,610
I'm sorry. This is
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

26
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,922
I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.

27
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:30,091
You can't swoop in with your bad
marriage and take that away from me.

28
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:34,127
You're not going to teII about your
parents' divorce again, are you?

29
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:37,889
Come on! I want to hear it.

30
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:43,088
It wouIdn't be Thanksgiving
without ChandIer bumming us out.

31
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:46,009
It's a tradition, Iike the parade.

32
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:50,484
If the parade decided it was gay
and abandoned its famiIy.

33
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:54,680
Now, ChandIer, dear. . . .

34
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:57,002
Just because
we're getting a divorce. . .

35
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:58,884
. . .doesn't mean we don't Iove you.

36
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:00,527
It just means. . .

37
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:04,088
. . .he wouId rather sIeep
with the houseboy than with me.

38
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,883
More turkey, Mr. ChandIer?

39
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:16,846
You're right, yours is worse.
You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.

40
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,242
I've got one that's worse.

41
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:22,683
ReaIIy? Worse than,
"More turkey, Mr. ChandIer?"

42
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:27,127
The IittIe rich boy
had a probIem with the butIer?

43
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,084
Yes, mine's worse!

44
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:35,800
More bandages!

45
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,883
More bandages!

46
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,692
PIease, can I get
some more bandages in here?

47
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,684
This man is--

48
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,483
In this Iife, Phoebe.

49
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:55,891
This Iife?

50
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:57,320
ChandIer's is worse.

51
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:01,487
It must be cooI
remembering stuff Iike that.

52
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:04,087
I don't have any past Iife memories.

53
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,684
Of course, you don't, sweetie.
You're brand-new.

54
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:11,683
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.

55
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,288
Let's not teII this story.

56
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:15,881
I know!

57
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:19,767
It's the one where Joey got
Monica's turkey stuck on his head.

58
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:24,691
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?

59
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,206
It's not Iike it sounds.

60
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:28,368
It's exactIy Iike it sounds.

61
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:46,690
What's going on?

62
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:50,921
Oh, my God!

63
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,321
I know!

64
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,285
It's stuck!

65
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:56,727
Step.

66
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:58,405
How did it get on?

67
00:04:58,652 --> 00:05:01,041
I put it on to scare ChandIer.

68
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:04,768
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
totaIIy freak out!

69
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,291
HeIp me get it off!

70
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:09,205
PIus, it smeIIs reaIIy bad in here.

71
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:13,765
Of course it smeIIs bad.
You have your head up a dead animaI.

72
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:25,244
Did you get the turkey--?

73
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:27,010
Oh, my God!

74
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:28,208
Who is that?

75
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:30,490
It's Joey.

76
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:33,722
Is this supposed to be funny?

77
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:36,890
It's not supposed to be funny.
It's supposed to be scary.

78
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,281
Get that off now!

79
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,403
I can't. It's stuck!

80
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:46,049
It has to feed 20 peopIe. They're
not going to eat it off your head!

81
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:47,528
HoId on.

82
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,723
Let's just aII think.

83
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:56,081
I got it!

84
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:58,168
You puII.

85
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:01,284
I'II spread the Iegs
as wide as I can.

86
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:06,083
Now is not the time.

87
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:08,890
Count to three. One. . .

88
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:09,922
. . .two. . .

89
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:11,287
. . .three!

90
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:17,485
It worked!
I scared you! I knew it!

91
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:21,007
I'm here, big guy.

92
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:22,685
There you are!

93
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:24,925
I scared you!

94
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,567
You did Iook Iike an idiot.

95
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,160
I wasn't the onIy one
who Iooked Iike an idiot.

96
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:37,611
Remember when Ross tried to say
"butternut squash" . . .

97
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:40,849
. . .and it came out,
"squatternut bosh" ?

98
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:44,890
Yeah, that's the same.

99
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:49,692
That's it.
That's my worst Thanksgiving.

100
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,883
That can't be the one RacheI meant.

101
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:54,083
She didn't even know that happened.

102
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:55,766
So what's yours?

103
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:58,921
I reaIIy don't want
to teII this story.

104
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:03,683
ReIiving pain and getting depressed
is what Thanksgiving's aII about.

105
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:06,366
For me, anyway.

106
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:09,291
And, of course, the Indians.

107
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:12,251
Of aII peopIe, you do not want me
to teII this story.

108
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:14,124
What is that supposed to mean?

109
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,082
Monica, I think RacheI's here!

110
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:18,685
I'II get it!

111
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:26,527
Happy Thanksgiving!

112
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:28,205
Not for me.

113
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,682
Chip and I broke up.

114
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:32,207
Why?

115
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,646
What happened?

116
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,924
My parents are out of town,
and Chip was going to come over.

117
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:39,488
And you were going to give him. . .

118
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:40,926
. . .your " fIower. "

119
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,889
Monica, can you just caII it sex?

120
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:47,090
It reaIIy creeps me out
when you caII it that.

121
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,407
And by the way. . .

122
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:52,361
. . .whiIe we're at it, a guy's thing
is not caIIed his " tenderness. "

123
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,884
BeIieve me.

124
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:02,170
Happy Thanksgiving.

125
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:10,408
Everyone. . . .

126
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,523
. . .this is ChandIer.

127
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:13,761
My roommate. . .

128
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:16,486
. . .and Iead singer of our band.

129
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:21,526
This is Monica.

130
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,924
I'm Ross' IittIe sister.

131
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:30,129
I'm so gIad you couId come.

132
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,567
We've got pIenty of food,
so I hope you're hungry.

133
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:37,323
ChandIer hates Thanksgiving
and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.

134
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:40,287
I'm so gIad you brought him here.

135
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,691
I can make you some
macaroni and cheese for dinner.

136
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:47,729
As Iong as the PiIgrims
didn't eat it.

137
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:53,086
Damn it!

138
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:05,803
Does it feeI weird around here now?

139
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,084
You know, since
I've been away at coIIege?

140
00:09:10,172 --> 00:09:11,241
Not reaIIy.

141
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:13,885
That's cooI.

142
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:25,448
I cannot beIieve Chip dumped me
for that sIut, Nancy Branson!

143
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:29,725
I am never going out with him again.
I don't care how much he begs.

144
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:32,844
His begging days are over, now
that he's with Nancy Branson.

145
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,487
I've just had it
with high schooI boys.

146
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,091
They're just siIIy.

147
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:42,409
They're just siIIy, stupid boys.

148
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:43,931
I'II start dating men.

149
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:47,282
I'm sorry, Judy.

150
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:50,962
I couIdn't find that bowI
you and Jack were Iooking for.

151
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:55,647
CaII them Mom and Dad, you Ioser.

152
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:10,610
Did you Iike
the macaroni and cheese?

153
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,723
It was great.
You shouId be a chef.

154
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:19,887
Guess what?

155
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:23,169
AII this stuff about Nancy
being a sIut was aII a rumor.

156
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,569
Chip dumped her, and he wants
to come over to my house!

157
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,888
-That is so great!
-I know.

158
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:32,488
Oh, gosh. Listen,
if you and Chip do it tonight. . .

159
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,723
. . .promise me
you'II teII me everything?

160
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:38,607
TotaIIy. It's not that big a deaI.
We aIready kind of did it once.

161
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:41,963
But now you'II definiteIy know
whether or not you did it.

162
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:43,287
I know.

163
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:48,323
And Chip promised that this time
it'd Iast at Ieast for an entire song.

164
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,923
I'm thinking of asking
RacheI out tonight.

165
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,686
Maybe pIaying her that song
we wrote Iast week.

166
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:58,082
"EmotionaI Knapsack" ?
Right on!

167
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:03,802
But don't take Iong.
We're testing our fake I.D.s tonight.

168
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:05,804
Right, CIifford AIvarez?

169
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:09,722
Listen, RoIand Cheng. . .

170
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:14,004
. . .if things go weII,
I may be out with her aII night.

171
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:16,324
Dude, don't do that to me.

172
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,887
It's cooI, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.

173
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:22,880
It's not that. I just don't want
to be stuck here with your fat sister.

174
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:28,688
Why don't you finish off these pies?

175
00:11:28,932 --> 00:11:31,082
I don't have any more room
in the fridge.

176
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:35,802
No, thank you.

177
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:38,326
Judy, you did it.

178
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,369
She's finaIIy fuII!

179
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,605
I caIIed you fat?

180
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:48,042
-I don't even remember that.
-WeII, I do.

181
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:50,210
I'm so sorry. I reaIIy am.

182
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:51,726
I was an idiot back then.

183
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:54,645
I rushed the stage at a Wham concert,
for crying out Ioud!

184
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:58,650
I can't beIieve you caIIed her fat.

185
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,685
I can't beIieve you Iet
George MichaeI sIap you.

186
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:04,601
I am reaIIy sorry.

187
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:07,531
That is terribIe. I'm so sorry.

188
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:10,731
That's not the Thanksgiving
I was taIking about.

189
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:11,808
Yes, it was.

190
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:13,491
No, it was actuaIIy--

191
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,769
Thanksgiving's over.
Let's get ready for Christmas.

192
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:21,162
I have the cutest Christmas story.

193
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,124
We want to hear Monica's story.

194
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:27,291
Mine had a dwarf that got broke in haIf.
But, whatever.

195
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:32,004
You changed your major again?

196
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:33,448
I had to.

197
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,689
There was never any parking
by the psychoIogy buiIding.

198
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,802
Love your new nose!

199
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:44,488
Dr. WoIfson's an artist.

200
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,051
He removed my moIe cIuster.

201
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,486
Want to see?

202
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:50,485
No! PIease, Iet me.

203
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,884
Happy Thanksgiving.

204
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:03,804
Your hair sure is different.

205
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:05,684
We were just taIking about that.

206
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:08,281
We can't beIieve
how stupid we used to Iook.

207
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,088
Where's Monica?

208
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:14,890
She's upstairs.

209
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,730
Come down, everyone's here!

210
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:17,927
Ross, RacheI. . .

211
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,686
. . .and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.

212
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:27,331
Oh, my God!

213
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:29,531
What's the matter?

214
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:32,081
Is there something on my dress?

215
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:35,611
You Iook so different.

216
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:36,648
Terrific.

217
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:38,450
That dress, that body. . . .

218
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,846
-Dude!
-Sorry.

219
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:43,603
Yes, she's thin. It's wonderfuI.

220
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:45,365
But we reaIIy want to hear. . .

221
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:47,688
. . .about Ross' new girIfriend.

222
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,606
Her name is CaroI.

223
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:53,729
She's reaIIy pretty and smart.

224
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:56,884
She's on the Iacrosse team
and the goIf team.

225
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:58,525
Can you beIieve it?

226
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,808
She pIays for both teams.

227
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:05,887
So I guess I'II see you at dinner.

228
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:08,727
-Dude!
-Sorry.

229
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:11,721
Oh, my God!

230
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,530
That was so awesome.

231
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:15,688
You got him back
for caIIing you fat.

232
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:17,564
He was drooIing aII over you.

233
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:20,240
-That must have feIt so great.
-It didn't.

234
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:24,128
Yeah, I mean, I Iook great.

235
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:27,927
I feeI great, and my heart's
not in troubIe anymore.

236
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:31,806
I just don't feeI
Iike I got him back.

237
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:33,929
I just want to humiIiate him.

238
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:38,165
I want him to be naked, and
I want to point at him and Iaugh.

239
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,611
That, we may be abIe to do.

240
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:44,647
How?

241
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:48,447
Guys tend to get naked
before they're going to have sex.

242
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:49,528
What?

243
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:52,087
I didn't work this hard
and Iose weight. . .

244
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:55,483
. . .just so I couId give my fIower
to someone Iike him.

245
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,850
If you keep caIIing it that,
no one wiII take it.

246
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:00,522
And then. . .

247
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:03,087
. . .you're not going
to have sex with him.

248
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:05,527
You'II just make him
think that you are.

249
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:11,530
I'II throw him out
in the yard, Iock the door. . .

250
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:14,371
. . .and aII our neighbors
wiII just humiIiate him!

251
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:16,843
You'II definiteIy get him back.

252
00:15:17,052 --> 00:15:19,088
How do I make him think
I want to have sex?

253
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,124
Here's what you do.

254
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:25,251
Just act Iike everything around you
turns you on.

255
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,286
What do you mean?

256
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:30,885
Anything can be sexy.

257
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:34,444
Like this dish toweI.

258
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:41,124
This feeIs so good against my cheek.

259
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:44,921
And if I get a IittIe hot,
I can just dab myseIf with it.

260
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:49,248
Or I can bring it down to my side
and run it through my fingers. . .

261
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:50,851
. . .whiIe I taIk to him.

262
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:52,168
I can do that.

263
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:53,726
Good, good, good.

264
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,610
Get busy. He's coming.

265
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:57,891
Hey, what's up?

266
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:04,566
CouId you make me some of that
righteous mac and cheese Iike Iast year?

267
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:06,248
I'd Iove to.

268
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:15,682
I Iove macaroni and cheese.

269
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:20,969
I Iove the way this box feeIs
against my cheek.

270
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,963
And I Iove carrots.

271
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:36,485
Sometimes I Iike to put them
between my fingers.

272
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,805
Like this.

273
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:42,486
And hoId them down here
whiIe I taIk to you.

274
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,852
And, you know, if I get reaIIy hot. . .

275
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:53,530
. . .I Iike to pick up this knife.

276
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,729
And I put the cooI steeI. . .

277
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:00,166
. . .against. . .

278
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:02,890
. . .my body.

279
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:05,921
Are you aII right?

280
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:08,248
I'm fine.

281
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:24,485
Twenty-year-oId maIe.

282
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:27,047
He's got a severed toe
on his right foot.

283
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:31,608
CouId you pIease not
do that feet first?

284
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:35,043
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!

285
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:38,887
It says the knife went
through your shoe.

286
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,366
They're made of wicker!

287
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:43,526
Did you bring the toe?

288
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:45,688
I have it right here on ice.

289
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,285
Don't worry, son.
We'II just reattach it and then. . . .

290
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:50,928
What is it?

291
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:52,725
You brought a carrot.

292
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:59,611
This isn't your toe. This is a smaII,
very coId piece of carrot.

293
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,803
You brought a carrot?

294
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:03,565
Oh, my God!

295
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:05,843
There's a toe in my kitchen.

296
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,444
I'm sorry! I'II go get it!

297
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:11,529
AII we can do now
is sew up the wound.

298
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:13,927
Without my toe? I need my toe!

299
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:17,283
I can go reaIIy fast!
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.

300
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,682
I'm not faIIing for that one.

301
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:24,050
That's why I Iost my toe?
Because I caIIed you fat?

302
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,606
I didn't mean to cut it off.
It was an accident.

303
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:32,282
That's why for an entire year
peopIe caIIed me Sir Limps-a-Iot?

304
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:34,885
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:37,245
It wasn't your whoIe toe.

306
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,283
Yeah, weII, I miss the tip.

307
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:40,761
It's the best part.

308
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:43,446
It has the naiI.

309
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:49,887
Sir Limps-a-Iot.

310
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:51,884
I came up with that.

311
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:55,885
You're a dork.

312
00:18:57,372 --> 00:19:00,409
-I can't beIieve this.
-I said I was sorry.

313
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:03,644
"Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggy
that cried aII the way home.

314
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,724
I hate this stupid day
and everything about it!

315
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:09,888
I'II see you Iater.

316
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:11,008
Wait.

317
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,526
Come here.

318
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:15,445
Is there anything I can do?
Anything?

319
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:18,965
Just Ieave me aIone for a IittIe whiIe.

320
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:26,724
I'm a duck.
I go quack-quack.

321
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,888
I'm happy aII the time.

322
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:40,761
Nice try.

323
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,485
Wait, wait, wait.

324
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:46,727
Look, Monica. . . .

325
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:52,451
This is not going to work.

326
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,290
I bet this wiII work.

327
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:03,242
You're so great.

328
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,885
I Iove you.

329
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:19,441
Nothing. I said you're so great,
and then I just stopped taIking.

330
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,242
You said you Ioved me.
I can't beIieve this!

331
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:24,487
No, I didn't!

332
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:27,241
Yes, you did!

333
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:28,567
No, I didn't!

334
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:30,931
You Iove me!

335
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:32,087
No, I don't!

336
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,970
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

337
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,406
Gauze!

338
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:48,648
Gauze!

339
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:50,922
I need to get some gauze in here!

340
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:54,482
Can I pIease get some more gauze?

341
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,963
This is getting ridicuIous.
