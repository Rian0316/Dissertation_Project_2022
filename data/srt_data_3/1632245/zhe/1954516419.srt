1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,660
Okay, help me out here.

2
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:22,532
How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,701
Maybe he took a class at the
adult bookstore. That's how I learned.

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,541
I can't believe you've never seen
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,271
And I can't believe you've never read
Eat, Pray, Love.

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,685
When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run
Away From a Giant Boulder, I'll read it.

7
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:44,484
I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love,
changed your life, I'm not reading it.

8
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:47,687
You know,
I could totally rock a hat like that.

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,525
That's the work of noted Hollywood
costume designer Deborah Nadoolman.

10
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:55,864
She designed the red and black jacket
in Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video...

11
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,234
...which I've never viewed
in its entirety...

12
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,467
...as I find zombies dancing
in synchronicity implausible.

13
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:06,314
And also, it's really scary.

14
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,451
Could someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

15
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:13,155
There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

16
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,551
Penny,
you should come with us Friday...

17
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:19,024
...to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

18
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:21,686
I'm watching it now.
Why would I wanna see it again?

19
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,593
Because the print they're showing...

20
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:27,827
...has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

21
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:31,905
Wha... Twenty-one seconds?
That'll be like seeing a whole new movie.

22
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:35,602
Exactly. They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

23
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,115
Leonard, I'm no expert, but I believe
what we just heard from Penny...

24
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,513
...was sarcasm.

25
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,916
Oh, good. I'm 8-for-26 this month.

26
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,351
Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys
enjoy your extra 21 seconds.

27
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:55,361
If I could make you understand why this
is a cool thing, we'd still be together.

28
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:58,557
Hmm... Yeah. No, we wouldn't.

29
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:02,763
Uh-huh. I'm guessing 21 seconds
had something to do with that too.

30
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:39,434
May I point out to you all that
the screening is first come, first served?

31
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:42,975
Relax, it's 5:00.
The movie doesn't start till midnight.

32
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:48,780
The movie
starts at midnight and it's already 5:00.

33
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:51,977
If we miss it, we'll have the fun of
listening to Sheldon...

34
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:54,316
...whine about it
for the rest of our lives.

35
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:57,152
See? Howard's on my side.

36
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,788
Actually, I'm not.
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

37
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:04,194
Drat. Now I'm 8-for-27.

38
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,698
Don't worry, Sheldon. We'll be fine.

39
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:10,805
What happened to the Leonard who
waited in line with me for 14 hours...

40
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,305
...to see the premiere
Nemesis?

41
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:17,707
Oh, well, he waited in line for 14 hours
while you napped in a lawn chair...

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,678
...he got in a fight
when he stepped out of line to pee...

43
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,148
...and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him.

44
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,220
And worst of all,
Nemesis.

45
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,347
But how were our seats?

46
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,018
- Excellent.
- I rest my case.

47
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:34,196
Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

48
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,226
As the newest member
of your social group...

49
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:42,735
...I'll gain more acceptance by siding
with your friends from time to time.

50
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,701
Shrewd.

51
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:50,102
Leonard, you're right.
We should enjoy our meal, arrive late...

52
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:54,044
...and risk winding up with terrible seats,
assuming we get in at all.

53
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,342
Thank you, Amy.

54
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,612
See? It's working.

55
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:02,224
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

56
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:04,256
- Olive.
- "I love" you too.

57
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,722
Guys, that's really starting to get old.

58
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:10,956
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,531
I have a girlfriend and you don't.

60
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,868
Hysterical.

61
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:20,907
We don't know that yet, he isn't finished.
I have a girlfriend and you don't who?

62
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:24,870
So are you sure you don't wanna
come with us to Raiders?

63
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,914
Oh, no. That movie has melting faces.

64
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:29,415
It reminds me of the time...

65
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:33,077
...I dropped that vial of flesh-eating
bacteria into the monkey lab.

66
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,122
Besides, Penny and I
are having a girls' night tonight.

67
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:40,288
Girls' night? What does that entail?

68
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:44,227
Oh, you know, girls get together,
hang out, share girl talk.

69
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,430
I'm a girl.

70
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:51,071
Well, maybe you can join us.
I'll ask Penny.

71
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,936
No need. Penny and I are very close.

72
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:56,167
- You are?
- Yes.

73
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,904
In fact, our menses are synchronized.

74
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:07,283
Penny, Bernadette tells me
you're planning a girls' night.

75
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,787
Yeah?

76
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,687
I'm a girl.

77
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:14,159
Oh, it was just gonna be
me and Bernadette.

78
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,662
I thought you were going to movies
with the guys?

79
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,527
Yes, but they're not girls. I'm a girl.

80
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,761
Yeah. No, no. I got that.

81
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,768
- What's the dress code?
- Just wear something comfortable.

82
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:31,606
All right. I'll have to go shopping.

83
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:34,544
Knock, knock.

84
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:36,308
- Who's there?
- Hugh.

85
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,977
- Hugh who?
- "You" people need to listen to me.

86
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,952
It's time to get in line for the movie.

87
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:50,325
And that's how you tell
a knock-knock joke.

88
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:58,330
Under normal circumstances
I'd say I told you so...

89
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:03,034
...but as I have told you so with such
vehemence and frequency already...

90
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,237
...the phrase has lost all meaning.

91
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:11,045
Therefore, I will be replacing it
with the phrase "I informed you thusly."

92
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,347
Can't wait for that to start.

93
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:15,683
I informed you thusly.

94
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:19,227
Eight-for-28.

95
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:23,024
This is where we could've been
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

96
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,567
This is where we could've been
if Koothrappali hadn't ordered dessert.

97
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,670
I earned it, dude. I ate all my broccoli.

98
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:34,866
And here's where we are,
the runts in a large litter...

99
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:40,572
...unlikely to ever reach
the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.

100
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,513
So I guess it's a good thing
we stopped for dinner.

101
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:49,217
When facing disappointment,
Eat, Pray, Love teaches us...

102
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,622
Oh, shut up.

103
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,026
So, anyway,
to make a long story short...

104
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:59,531
...turns out I have
an unusually firm cervix.

105
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:04,605
You know, heh, Amy,
when we say girl talk...

106
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:08,733
...it doesn't just have to be
about our lady parts.

107
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:13,078
Shame. Because I have a real zinger
about my tilted uterus.

108
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:20,745
Penny, your nails look great.

109
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:21,980
Oh, thanks.

110
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:25,150
I found this place in Alhambra.
It's in a woman's basement.

111
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:29,730
I think it's a front for human trafficking,
but they do a really good job.

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,091
A colleague of mine did her thesis
on the fungus...

113
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,569
...that grows on improperly sterilized
manicure implements.

114
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:40,473
Well, don't tell me that's not girl talk.

115
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:45,444
So where should we go tonight?
A bar? A club? A movie?

116
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:47,275
Or we could just stay here.

117
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,950
Yes, and continue to bond.

118
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:52,679
I have a feeling that after tonight, one
of you will become my best friend forever.

119
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,483
Or BFF, if you prefer.

120
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,452
Which I don't.

121
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,689
All right,
time to open Bachelor Number 2.

122
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:05,696
Gee, I don't know if I should drink more.
I have to drive home.

123
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:09,065
And I've got enough trouble
seeing over the dashboard as it is.

124
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:12,836
That's okay. You can just sleep here.

125
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,635
Oh, good, a slumber party.

126
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,176
We'll do makeovers,
initiate phony phone calls...

127
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:20,611
...and have spirited pillow fights
in our frilly nighties.

128
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:24,116
Gosh, Amy, I don't know if I would
call this an actual slumber party.

129
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,187
Oh, I've always wanted to be
invited to a slumber party.

130
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,153
- Oh, you never were?
- Not even when you were a kid?

131
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,852
There was the time
I had my tonsils out...

132
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:35,997
...and I shared a room
with a little Vietnamese girl.

133
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,496
She didn't make it through the night,
but up till then it was kind of fun.

134
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:46,632
Okay, well, I guess we're having
a slumber party.

135
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:50,835
Pillow fight.

136
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,414
Uh, I hope they let us in soon.

137
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,917
I'm tired of running to the gas station
to use the bathroom.

138
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:03,422
The guy makes me buy a Gatorade
every time. It's a vicious circle.

139
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:07,423
Too bad you don't have
a stadium pal like me.

140
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:09,187
What's a stadium pal?

141
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:10,559
Let me put it this way.

142
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:14,669
Takes care of the bathroom problem
and it keeps your calf warm.

143
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:18,532
Hey, guys, bad news,
I just did a quick calculation.

144
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:22,541
Given the size of the theater
and this line, we might not get seats.

145
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,844
What did he say?

146
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:28,881
Nice going, Raj.
Just got him down for his nap.

147
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,418
We might not get seats?

148
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,748
It's fine, it's fine. Go back to sleep.

149
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:37,392
Oh, I informed you thusly.
I so informed you thusly.

150
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,260
Howard, you talk to him.

151
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,090
Howard?

152
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,960
You're peeing, aren't you?

153
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:49,303
Hey, look who's here. Hey, buddies.

154
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:51,598
Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton.

155
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:55,369
The Jar Jar Binks
of the Star Trek universe.

156
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:59,446
Me think that very funny.

157
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,074
Well, you can go think that
at the back of the line.

158
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,719
No cuts, not butts, no coconuts.

159
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:08,918
- Wil Wheaton.
- Yeah.

160
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:13,618
- I'm a big fan.
- Of what? Poorly executed beards?

161
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:16,730
Do you think you could get me
and my friends into the movie?

162
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,766
- No problem. Come on, I'll hook you up.
- Awesome.

163
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,271
Meesa gonna go into the movie now.

164
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,339
Bye-bye.

165
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:30,908
This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek.

166
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:34,280
There should be no value
to his pseudo-celebrity here.

167
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:38,783
And even at Star Trek conventions,
they only let him in if he helps set up!

168
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:40,455
Calm down, Sheldon.

169
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:41,748
I will not calm down.

170
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:44,950
This affront to justice and decency
cannot go unanswered.

171
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,651
As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said:

172
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,462
"The line must be drawn here.
This far, no farther."

173
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,667
Had to wake him up from his nap,
didn't you?

174
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,734
You know what I really love
about Howard?

175
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:06,097
His chest hair.

176
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,702
Howard has a hairy chest?

177
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:12,103
No, just the one.

178
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:15,271
But it's really long.

179
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:21,814
Sultry Sunrise Red.
What do you think?

180
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,648
My nails have never looked
so pretty before.

181
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:26,552
Get it off.

182
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,424
Oh, oh, looks like they're getting
ready to let people in.

183
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:35,122
Listen to what
Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting:

184
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:38,734
"Best seats in house
for Raiders screening.

185
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:42,066
Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."

186
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,734
Why do you read his Twitter feed?
It's only gonna upset you.

187
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:50,108
I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard.
Had Twitter existed at the time...

188
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:53,717
...would not General Custer
have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull?

189
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:58,787
Would not Lee have followed Grant?
Would not Spy have followed Spy?

190
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:04,360
I have more examples, but excuse me.
Hello?

191
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:09,728
Well, this seems like an odd time
to test my cell-phone quality, but go on.

192
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,226
Test phrases? All right.

193
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:15,664
"I'm a toat".

194
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,831
"Al but".

195
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,840
"Twad".

196
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:23,811
All together? "I'm a total butt wad."

197
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,452
Why are you laughing?

198
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:31,346
Hello?

199
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,447
And that, girls, is how you make
a phony phone call.

200
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:39,994
I'm not sure I grasp the full
entertainment value, but all right.

201
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,896
Next on Wikipedia's list of
slumber party activities, "truth or dare."

202
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:46,535
It's your game, you go first.

203
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:49,467
Hang on, I'm familiarizing myself
with the rules.

204
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:52,703
Seems fairly straightforward.

205
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:55,808
- Bernadette, truth or dare?
- Truth.

206
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,006
All right. To what temperature
must you heat beef...

207
00:12:59,184 --> 00:13:03,314
...in order to kill the prion that causes
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy?

208
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:07,083
- Um...
- Remember, you have to answer honestly.

209
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:11,886
No, Amy, you're supposed to ask her
something personal or embarrassing.

210
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,758
Oh, all right.

211
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,662
What is the circumference
of your areolas?

212
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:27,175
"Munching on complimentary popcorn.
Woot-woot."

213
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:30,542
Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is:

214
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:34,845
"Popcorn lodged in trachea.
Choking to death."

215
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,577
Woot-woot.

216
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:39,220
Guys, I am sorry, we are full up.

217
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,255
What...? No!

218
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,019
- We're full up!
- We really wanna see this.

219
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:45,594
Is there anything you can do?

220
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:48,857
Sorry, fire regulations.
Should have gotten here earlier.

221
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:52,764
This is nothing but a blatant abuse
of power by a petty functionary.

222
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:56,964
Explain to me why Wil Wheaton
and his lackeys get in and we don't.

223
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,773
Because I'm the petty functionary
with a clipboard, bitch.

224
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:05,477
I guess that's that.

225
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,618
Let's go home.

226
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:11,344
You know what? I'm going back
to "I told you so." I told you so.

227
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:14,288
We can still see something.

228
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,484
The new Sandra Bullock movie
is playing.

229
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:19,357
You know Sandy B always brings it.

230
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:21,794
Look. A side door.

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,160
Come on, Short Round.

232
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:26,497
I guess we'd better go after him.

233
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,572
- Short Round?
- Indy's sidekick from Temple of Doom.

234
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,675
Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?

235
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,003
You're right.
It should be a cuddly Asian boy.

236
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:35,805
Like me.

237
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:42,251
And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye,
and Nicholas is scalded in the toute.

238
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,447
This tale is doon,
and God save all the route.

239
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,426
What the hell was that?

240
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:55,258
Bernadette dared me
to tell a dirty story.

241
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:58,526
"The Miller's Tale" by Chaucer
is the dirtiest story I know.

242
00:14:59,604 --> 00:15:01,697
It would've been hidden
in sock drawers...

243
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:04,670
...if people in the 14th century
had worn socks.

244
00:15:05,443 --> 00:15:07,434
I thought it was pretty spicy.

245
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:11,605
Especially the part
where he kisses her "nether ye."

246
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:14,910
You might not like it as much
if you knew what "nether ye" meant.

247
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:19,215
Hint, if one cares about hygiene,
one ought not be kissing it.

248
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,987
Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?

249
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:25,662
Truth.

250
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,129
Why are you still hanging out with
Leonard even though you broke up?

251
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,792
Oh, that's an excellent question.
For two people no longer pair-bonded...

252
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:36,304
...you spend an inordinate
amount of time in each other's company.

253
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:38,435
Yeah.

254
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:42,039
Dare.

255
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:46,673
I don't believe the rules allow for
an ex post facto change.

256
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:48,709
Yeah.

257
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:53,051
Look, just because we're not
seeing each other anymore...

258
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:56,523
...doesn't mean we can't be friends.
I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

259
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:59,322
Then why did you terminate
your relationship with him?

260
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:03,331
I don't know. He got really serious
and I wasn't ready for it.

261
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,401
How will you react if, in the future...

262
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,368
...you become ready for it
and Leonard is unavailable...

263
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:13,169
...because another woman has realized
he is, to use your words, "A great guy?"

264
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:16,711
You can only ask one question.

265
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:19,980
- That one.
- That one.

266
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:24,384
You know what,
I don't wanna play anymore.

267
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:34,690
Oh, I'm not sure how this is scored,
but I believe we may have won.

268
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,235
Sheldon?

269
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,198
Sheldon?

270
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,732
Where did he go?

271
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:50,612
We're looking for Sheldon,
not Marmaduke.

272
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,308
You whistled?

273
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,145
What is that?

274
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,448
Raiders of the Lost Ark
with 21 additional seconds.

275
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,658
If I can't see it, no one else can see it.

276
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:05,556
Wait. Sheldon, this is crazy.

277
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:09,255
No, crazy was leaving
the projection booth unattended.

278
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:12,061
Listen, you are over-tired.
You're not thinking right.

279
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:14,602
Put the movie back
before we get into trouble.

280
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:19,436
Trouble is my middle name, Leonard.
Actually, it's Lee, but I prefer "Trouble."

281
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:22,840
Oh, look who they let in.

282
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:26,676
Don't worry, Wil Wheaton,
I was just leaving.

283
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:33,789
- Come on, Short Round!
- Yeah.

284
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,960
Come on, guys. Hurry up, hurry up.

285
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:43,191
Let's see you run with a bag of urine
strapped to your leg.

286
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,097
He's got the movie! Get him!

287
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,206
Why is there never a pontoon plane
when you need one?

288
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:07,791
She's been in there a long time.

289
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,926
Clearly, losing truth or dare upset her.

290
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,897
We should try to take her mind off it...

291
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:16,590
...with another slumber party activity.
- Like what?

292
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:19,259
The Internet suggests
that slumber party guests...

293
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:22,804
...often engage in harmless
experimentation with lesbianism.

294
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:29,313
Where exactly on the Internet
have you been looking?

295
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:31,606
- Penny?
- Oh, hey, Amy.

296
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:33,648
Look, I'm sorry I got so upset, I just...

297
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:36,218
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

298
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,547
What are you doing?

299
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:40,520
Don't worry, I'll avoid the nether ye.

300
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,623
I might have gone with
eating raw cookie dough.
