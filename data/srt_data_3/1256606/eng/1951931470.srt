PRESEND DAY

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,100
PRESEND DAY
<i>is the one that follows asking
the question...</i>

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,600
Will you marry me?

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,900
<i>Your brain goes into overdrive,</i>

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,300
<i>imagining every
possible response.</i>

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,900
No.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, God, no.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,300
You want me to marry...

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,200
No.

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,800
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted.
I can't.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
Mark Johnson,
the quarterback

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
from your high school football
team, already asked me.

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,400
What's up, Turd?

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,400
It's Ted!

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,700
<i>But if you're lucky,
she may answer with the single</i>

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,400

Tune in at 11:00
for the shocking... tooth.

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,200
Okay, I officially
hate my job.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not a reporter,
I'm just someone

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,500
who shows up at night
and scares people.

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm the bogeyman
with a teleprompter.

43
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,800
"Bogeyman
with a teleprompter. "

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
That's hilarious!
Great joke,

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,900
Robin, great joke.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
Barney, no offense
to Robin,

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,900
but that wasn't
that funny.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Are you kidding?
That was a great joke.

49
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,100
It's smart, funny beautiful,
the whole package.

50
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,500
It's everything you're
afraid to let yourself want.

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,000
In a joke.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter. "

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,100
Classic.

54
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,500
Okay, what is so urgent
that you called me and begged me

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,300
to come over
at 7:22 in the morning?

56
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,100
I could tell you knew
something was up with me,

57
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,600
and you're right.

58
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,700
But I can't

59
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,800
tell you what it is.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
I should tell you,
but I can't!

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
I have to.
I never will!

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,700
I'm going to.
Let's just drop it.

63
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,900
What's up with you?

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,100
Barney, just say it.

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
I think I'm in love with Robin.

66
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,300
Hey, Lily needs
some gift ideas

67
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,900
for Stella's
wedding shower.

68
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,400
Does she like to cook?

69
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,300
Um... actually,
I don't know.

70
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Oh, what's her favorite color?

71
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,900
Don't know that either.

72
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,100
Well, does she have any hobbies?

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,600
Yes, she's exactly

74
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,400
the kind of person
who would have hobbies.

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
And interests, too.

76
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,800
I am one lucky son of a bitch.

77
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Dude, you don't know

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
anything about the woman
you're marrying.

79
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,100
What? You're crazy!
I know plenty.

80
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,500
What color are her eyes?

81
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,400
The color of the ocean
after a storm.

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,700
Which is?

83
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
Beautiful.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,600
I thought
you called me over here

86
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,400
to uncuff you
from your sex swing again,

87
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,500
but you're in love?

88
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
That is so sweet!

89
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,500
It's not "sweet

90
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
It's like a disease.

91
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,900
I slept with Robin one time
and I caught feelings.

92
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,600
I caught feelings bad.

93
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,500
I used protection
and everything.

94
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,400
Oh, Barney, you don't

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,100
"catch" feelings,
you just have them.

96
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,200
And they're good.

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,700
They're terrible!

98
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

99
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,400
She's all I think about.

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,300
I close my eyes, I see Robin.

101
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,700
I, I hear a song;
it reminds me of Robin.

102
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,600
- Morning.
- I sleep with that chick,

103
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,100
I'm thinking
about Robin.

104
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,500
Okay, so I don't
know every single detail about Stella.

105
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,200
What's this really about?

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
Do you not like her
or something?

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,500
No, Ted,
I like Stella a lot.

108
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,600
She's a Mets fan.

109
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,000
- Really? 
- It's just that everything
with you guys has moved so fast.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You've only known
each other a few months.

111
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,300
Don't you think maybe you should slow things
down a little bit?

112
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,500
Get to know each other better?

113
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,400
I'll have
a whole lifetime to get to know her better.

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,300
Right now, I know
the one thing that I have to: that I love her.

115
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,800
You love her?

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,600
Barney,

117
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,200
how can you be in love,

118
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,000
and still be sleeping
with anything that moves?

119
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm sorry,
I don't follow you.

120
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,700
That's like saying,
"How can an ant carry

121
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,200
"20 times its body weight,
but root beer floats are still delicious?"

122
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,900
Are the two even related?

123
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,300
Really? Ow!

124
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
Barney, you're going
to have to stop screwing around

125
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
if you want to be
Robin's boyfriend.

126
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,800
"Boyfriend"?

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,500
I don't want
to be Robin's boyfriend.

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,100
Well, what do you want, then?

129
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
I don't know.

130
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,000
I just want
to be with her.

131
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,500
All the time.

132
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I want to hear about her day and tell her
about mine.

133
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,100
I want to hold
her hand and smell her hair.

134
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,200
But I don't want to be
her stupid boyfriend.

135
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,200
Barney, what you just described
is a relationship

136
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,600
between a boyfriend
and a girlfriend.

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
And a pretty clingy one at that.

138
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,800
Look, Lily, are you going
to help me out with this or not?

139
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,900
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,900
I see a confused,
little kid in the corner

141
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,000
trying to eat
the lefty scissors,

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I gotta help the poor,
little bastard.

143
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,600
But only if you stop sleeping around.
Deal?

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Deal.

145
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,600
Coming up next,
is your local ice cream man

146
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,000
actually driving a roving
meth lab on wheels?

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Stay tuned for the full...

148
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,400
scoop.

149
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,500
Really?

150
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,600
- Uh-huh...
- Mmm...

151
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,700
I know dudes
think it's girlie for a guy to cook,

152
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,800
but us ladies?

153
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,300
We find it mighty sexy.

154
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,600
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,900
You know, uh...

156
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,800
my grandma
taught me how.

157
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
- Oh, yeah, she did.
- Yeah.

158
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,100
I had a lot of time after
school to watch her cook because

159
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,600
I wasn't good at sports.

160
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm on fire right now.

161
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,400
Delicious.
What's in this pesto?

162
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,600
Oh, you know, the usual:
basil, garlic, olive oil,

163
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,100
but can you guess
my secret ingredient?

164
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,500
- Peanuts. 
- Yes. How did you know that?

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,700
- Okay, let me think. What else? 
- You know what, sweetie?

166
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,400
I woke up so early and I had
a really long day at work.

167
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,700
And then there
was that whole thing

168
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,900
where you tried to kill me.

169
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,600
Can we please just go to sleep?

170
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
No, I clearly need
to know more about you.

171
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,200
Let's do firsts.
Um, first kiss?

172
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,100
Dale Harris, second grade.

173
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,500
Wait, you're talking
like peck on the cheek

174
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,300
or a full-on passionate
making out?

175
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,700
- Passionate making out.
- Okay, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.

176
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,900
Uh, first time you had sex.

177
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
- Dale Harris, second...
- Stop it.

178
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,300
Billy Devito,
sophomore year of college.

179
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,200
Prude.

180
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,700
Molly McKenzie,
junior year of high school.

181
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,800
Slut.

182
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,900
Robin just needs to see
this new see of you.

183
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,400
- So just call her up?
- Just call her up.

184
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
It's...

185
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Hi, Robin.

186
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,700
She wasn't there.

187
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,900
I left a voice mail.

188
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,400
You left a voice,
but it wasn't male.

189
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,200
Barney, I don't get it.

190
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,800
You've called a million
girls a million times.

191
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,700
Yeah, but those
were just booty calls.

192
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,500
On a booty call,
you barely even have to talk.

193
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,300
9:03 PM
<i>Around 9:00 p. m., you say...</i>

194
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Hey, baby, it's Barney.
You busy tonight?

195
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,700
Sweet.
See you in half an hour?

196
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,800
Can't wait.

197
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,400
12:22 AM
<i>But the later it gets,
the fewer words you need.</i>

198
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,700
Barney. Busy?

199
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,900
Sweet.

200
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,100
3:00 AM
<i>And by 3:00 in the morning...</i>

201
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,600
Sweet.

202
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
A question mark?

203
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
You got laid off
a question mark?

204
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,100
Ow! Hey!

205
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,000
It's no worse than your
super-obvious code words.

206
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,300
Rhinoceros.

207
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,700
We have to go.

208
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,100
Great. Now we need
a new code word.

209
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,000
Ah, ah, it's her,
it's Robin.

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,200
What do I do?

211
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
No-no-no-no, aah!
Robin...

212
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
great to hear from you.

213
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
To what do I owe the pleasure?

214
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,300
You called, went
, and hung up.

215
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,300
What do you want?

216
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,800
Help me!

217
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,300
Uh, just ask
her something.

218
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,400
How are you feeling today?

219
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Fine.

220
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
Something personal.

221
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,800
At what age did you first
get your period?

222
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,900
Did you just ask me
about about my period?

223
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,000
No, I did not.

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,700
Look, Barney,
I'm at work right now.

225
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,400
Just ask her out.

226
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,800
Um, Robin,
I was wondering if...

227
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,600
Nothing.
Gotta go. Bye.

228
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,700
Ha! That was
just a practical joke.

229
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,500
I'm not really in love
with Robin.

230
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,700
You should've seen the look
on your face.

231
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,500
There's cameras
right there and there and there. Ah!

232
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,100
What a legendary prank that we're never going
to speak of again.

233
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,300
PM 19:47:00

234
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Gross.

235
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Uh, first movie
you ever saw.

236
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,400
<i>Benji, 1981.</i>

237
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,700
I watched it recently with Lucy
and I just thought,

238
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,800
<i>"Oh, that dog
is so dead right now. "</i>

239
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,700
What about you?

240
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,300
My dad took me
to an old drive-in

241
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,200
<i>to see the original Star Wars.</i>

242
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,800
<i>You know, I've actually
never seen Star Wars.</i>

243
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,300
<i>She's never seen Star Wars?!</i>

244
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,200
Ted, the only people
in the universe who haven't seen

245
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,400
<i>Star Wars are the characters
in Star Wars,</i>

246
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,700
and that's 'cause they
lived them, Ted!

247
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,800
<i>That's 'cause they lived
the Star Wars.</i>

248
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,100
You've got to calm down.

249
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,500
I told you. I told you
you didn't

250
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,600
know this girl well enough.

251
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,200
What if you show it to her
and she doesn't like it?

252
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,700
Dude, it's just a movie.

253
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,300
<i>Ted, Star Wars is your all-time
favorite movie,</i>

254
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,700
and whether or not Stella
likes it is actually important.

255
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,400
It's like, it's a test
of how compatible you guys are.

256
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,900
Marshall, it's just a movie.

257
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
<i>It's just a movie.</i>

258
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,000
121 AWESOME MINUTES LATER

259
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,900
Okay, if Stella
doesn't like this movie,

260
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,200
- I can't marry her.
- No, you can't.

261
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,300
- You want to watch it again?
- Yes, I do.

262
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Wait, where are the boys? I
thought this was a group thing.

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,300
Yeah, I lied.

264
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,200
They're not coming
and I'm about to leave.

265
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,300
- Why?
- Because...

266
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
they're not in love with Robin,
and neither am I.

267
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
I mean, she's great and sweet.

268
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,900
I'm not going to pretend
that I hen't noticed her body,

269
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,600
but this is off topic.
Good luck.

270
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Wait, wait, I
can't do this.

271
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,800
She'll never take
me seriously.

272
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,500
- She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot. 
- Hey.

273
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,600
We both know
you're more than that.

274
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,600
Okay, just show Robin the
Barney I met the other day.

275
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,600
You mean the insecure,
touchy-feely she-male

276
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
who sounded alarmingly
close to Ted?

277
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Hey, Ted hit that
for over a year.

278
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,600
Wish me luck.

279
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,800
I just thought it'd be fun
to watch a movie tonight,

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,700
<i>and since you've
never seen Star Wars,</i>

281
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,600
I figured why not?

282
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
No big deal.

283
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,300
It's pretty good.

284
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
- Sounds like a plan.
- Hmm.

285
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,600
Hey, I'm just gonna
grab a beer.

286
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,900
- You want one?
- Um...

287
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,100
the movie's already
started, so...

288
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,800
Yeah, it's just some words flying through space.

289
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
I mean, I'm not going
to read that anyway.

290
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh, my God

291
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,600
Off to a bad start.

292
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
What are you doing
down there?

293
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm making sure my best friend
is marrying the right woman.

294
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
That's what I'm doing.

295
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,000
Dude, what the hell are you
doing, hiding behind the couch?

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
You need to get a job.

297
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
I really do, don't I?

298
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah.

299
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,200
So, Robin.
tell me about your day,

300
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,700
and not just what happened,

301
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,300
how you felt
about what happened.

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,800
What?

303
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm not looking
to problem-solve,

304
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm just looking to listen.

305
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,500
Why are you acting like this?

306
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,300
Like what?

307
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,900
You're being super nice.

308
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,100
It's freaking me out.

309
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Be gross, be inappropriate.

310
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,200
- Be Barney.
- Uh,

311
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm being Barney,

312
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,700
and I think
tonight's going to be

313
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,100
de- wait for it- lightful.

314
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,700
Delightful.

315
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Right.

316
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,700
Hey, um, so I went
to the chiropractor yesterday.

317
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,500
That guy bent me over the table
and pounded me for a good hour.

318
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Is insurance going
to cover that?

319
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,900
Sometimes they don't.

320
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,900
That's it?

321
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Okay.

322
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,500
Well, um,
today I was at the dentist.

323
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,300
That guy drilled me
all day long.

324
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
He drilled me hard.

325
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,800
He filled all of my cavities.

326
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,200
Come on, man.

327
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,200
Well, your teeth
look fantastic.

328
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
Who are you?

329
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,000
What?

330
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,900
Nothing.

331
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,500
You were staring
at me.

332
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,100
You look really
beautiful tonight.

333
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
You don't look
so bad yourself, mister.

334
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,300
Yeah, great scene,
great scene.

335
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,600
<i>Star Wars fun fact
number seven-</i>

336
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,200
George Lucas based
the film's structure

337
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,100
<i>on Akira Kurosawa's
The Hidden Fortress.</i>

338
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,300
Uh, he also owes a debt

339
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,000
to Joseph Campbell's work
with comparative mythology.

340
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,500
Yeah, Ted,
I'm losing wood over here.

341
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,900
What's going on?

342
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Nothing.

343
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,500
Wait, it's really important
to you

344
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
that I like this movie,
isn't it?

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No.

346
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,300
Well,I'm not gonna like it with you
staring at me the whole time.

347
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Go to your room and I will
come get you when it's over.

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,700
- Stella.
- Go.

349
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
Should I leave, too?

350
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What part,
what part, what part?

351
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,900
Thanks.

352
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,700
Nothing?

353
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,500
Not even
a glance?

354
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I mean, even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat
on those bad boys.

355
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
What the hell
is wrong with you, Barney?

356
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
I don't always want
to be that guy.

357
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,800
Sometimes I want to be someone you can have
an actual conversation with.

358
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,800
Now,tell me something about you that I don't know yet.

359
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,100
Seriously.

360
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,800
Okay.

361
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,200
Um... there's a job opening
at a new cable network

362
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,800
that would be perfect for me-

363
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,900
completely legit world news, interviews
with people who matter-

364
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,200
uh, but I decided
I'm not going to apply.

365
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Why not?

366
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,900
Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news
lady from some stupid local news channel.

367
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Hey, we both know
you're more than that.

368
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,500
Promise me you'll apply.

369
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,400
Barney, it's not as easy...

370
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,100
Promise me you'll apply.

371
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,100
Okay.

372
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,400
I promise.

373
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,700
Okay, she's up
to the scene where Luke, Leia,

374
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,000
Han and Chewy escape from the Death Star's
trash compactor.

375
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,500
<i>- Great scene.
- Great scene.</i>

376
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,700
Okay, we should
have just heard...

377
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,100
...but Stella
didn't make a peep.

378
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
- I'm gonna take a look.
- All right.

379
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,500
She's not even watching.

380
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,900
She's texting.

381
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
I'll tell her
you still want to be friends.

382
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,800
I don't believe this.

383
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,500
I don't believe this; she knows
this is important to me.

384
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
She's blatantly...

385
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,600
"Stop watching me, jackasses. "

386
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
To taking chances.

387
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,500
You know, Robin, there's
actually something I,

388
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
I do want to talk
to you about.

389
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,000
- Last call.
- Of course it is.

390
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
One more for the road?

391
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,700
Yeah, why not?

392
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,700
Hold that thought?

393
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,900
I will.

394
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,300
I loved it.

395
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Yes!

396
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,600
Yes, I am marrying a woman who is not only hot

397
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,000
<i>but loves Star Wars.</i>

398
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's the dream.

399
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
Yes

400
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,000
What was that?

401
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,400
I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me
through the space- time continuum.

402
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,200
We did it.

403
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,900
We did it, you masturbating
little bastard.

404
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,200
Champagne for everybody.

405
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,400
It was so good.

406
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,700
- You hated it, didn't you?
- Ugh, it's so stupid.

407
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,000
I mean, first of all, how do
they understand that walking...

408
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,600
bear they hang around
with all the time?

409
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,100
- Wookiee.
- Yeah, he goes...

410
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,900
And they're all like,

411
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,800
"That's a good point, Bear,
let's try that. "

412
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Okay, he's a Wookiee,

413
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,700
and his kind is actually
more intelligent than they appear.

414
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,700
Look, Stella, that is Ted's favorite movie
of all time.

415
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,200
He watches it
when he's home sick with the flu.

416
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,000
He watches it on rainy
Sunday afternoons in the fall.

417
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,700
He... he watches it
on Christmas Eve.

418
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,700
<i>Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health,
in good times and in bad.</i>

419
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,100
Do you really think
that you can pretend

420
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,100
to like a movie
that you actually hate for the rest of your life?

421
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,100
I do.

422
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,300
Well, then, Ted's a lucky guy.

423
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Bear.

424
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

425
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,400
So, here's the deal.

426
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,800
April, have...
you met Barney?

427
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Hi, Barney.

428
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,700
- Uh, hello. 
- April just finished her shift,

429
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
and she's looking
to blow off some steam.

430
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,700
- Ha.
- Hmm.

431
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,700
Would you excuse
us for one sec?

432
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,900
What are you doing?

433
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,200
Well, you were
so nice to me tonight,

434
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,400
I wanted to return the favor,
wingwoman-style.

435
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,800
So, as I was saying,
April, Barney...

436
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,900
is the Yankees'
new second-baseman.

437
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
And Barney,
April asked

438
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,000
if tomorrow, you could hit a goal
for her during the baseball match.

439
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
You can't make
this stuff up.

440
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,000
So, you two kids have fun.

441
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
So are you, uh,
nervous about the game?

442
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,100
Yeah, I'm nervous
for the other team

443
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,300
'cause when I step
up to that plate...

444
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,900
Look, April, I am not
a New York Yankee.

445
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
Any other night, I would probably
try to convince you

446
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,300
that I am, but I'm not.

447
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,200
I'm just some guy who's in love with the
girl that just left,

448
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,500
and she's never going
to feel the same way.

449
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,900
So I'm just going to go.

450
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,300
And that was it.

451
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm so sorry, Barney.

452
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,700
But you can't give up.

453
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,100
You know,
it may take some time,

454
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,400
but once Robin really sees
the new you...

455
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Barney, um,

456
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,100
when my family gets
to Yankee Stadium,

457
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,100
are the tickets
under your name or mine?

458
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,600
My name, and tell your
nephews to bring their mitts.

459
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,700
They're going to be
in foul ball country.

460
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,800
Come on.

461
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Okay, well, the Robin stuff
was completely true.

462
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,900
Damn it, Barney.

463
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I mean, for the last time,

464
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,300
<i>you can't, you can't
be in love with Robin</i>

465
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,400
and still be sleeping with
every bimbo on the planet.

466
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,500
You have to choose right now.

467
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,400
I choose bimbos.

468
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,600
- What?! 
- Hey, Lily, bimbos make me happy.

469
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,500
Bimbos make me
feel alive.

470
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,800
Bimbos make me want to
pretend to be a better man.

471
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200
This whole thing with
Robin was just a fling,

472
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,800
but at the end of the day,
my heart belongs to bimbos.

473
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,500
No, no, this is just
a defense mechanism

474
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,400
because you're afraid
of getting hurt.

475
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,500
You're just confused.

476
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,300
Oh, I'm not
confused, Lily.

477
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,400
You know who is confused?

478
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,800
Bimbos.

479
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,500
They're easily confused.

480
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,100
It's one of the
thousand little things

481
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,600
I love about them.

482
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,300
I love their vacant,
trusting stares;

483
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,000
their sluggish,
unencumbered minds;

484
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,600
their unresolved daddy issues.

485
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,500
I love them, Lily,
and they love me.

486
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,900
Bimbos have always been there
for me, through thick and thin.

487
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,200
Mostly thin.

488
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,600
B- man don't do thick crust.

489
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,800
What up?

490
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,500
See you, Barney.

491
