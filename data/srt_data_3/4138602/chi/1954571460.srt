00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,555
学习我们新的平板电脑点餐系统
to learn our new iPad order system.

3
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:09,830
我们还能怎么着 你从外面把门给锁了
We had no choice, you locked the door from the outside.

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:13,467
怎么都好 咱们都要学
Either way, we're learning.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,361
Han 为啥要升级咱们的点菜系统啊
Han, why would we update our order system

6
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:18,297
我们穿着七十年代的制服
when our uniforms are from the 1970's

7
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:21,133
拿的薪水是十九世纪的水平?
and our paycheck is from the 1800s?

8
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,135
我们开始教程吧
Let's get to the tutorial.

9
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:25,387
Max 你和我进行角色扮演
Max, you and I are going to role-play.

10
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:27,064
好啊 你来扮小婊子
All right, you can be the little bitch,

11
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:28,674
我就扮我自己
and I'll be me.

12
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:30,272
我不需要上这堂课
I don't need this lesson.

13
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:32,324
我很熟悉触屏
I'm very familiar with the touch screen.

14
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:36,027
谷歌的"谷"字就是我写上去的
Let's just say I put the "goo" in Google.

15
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,280
我来扮演顾客
I'm going to pretend I'm a customer,

16
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:40,282
要点一个汉堡
and order a hamburger.

17
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:43,868
你好 小姐 我要一个汉堡
Hello, miss. I'll have a hamburger.

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,290
当然可以 小姐
Certainly, miss.

19
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:52,877
请问您要不要加一点沙门氏菌?
Would you like that with or without salmonella?

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,631
Han 史蒂夫.乔布斯给我上了第一堂平台电脑课
Han, I got my first lesson on the iPad from Steve Jobs,

21
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:59,384
现在我还得让韩.乔布斯教我?
and now I'm getting it from Han Jobs?

22
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:02,721
Caroline 别表现得像是你比我懂这些玩意儿
Caroline, don't act like you know more about gadgets than me.

23
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:05,974
曾经的富人可比不过现在的亚洲人
Formerly rich doesn't beat currently Asian.

24
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:11,396
现在 大家看着自己的平板电脑
Now, come on, everyone look at their iPads.

25
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:14,482
什么平板电脑? 我没看到平板电脑
What iPad? I didn't see an iPad

26
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:16,484
什么? 不
What? No.

27
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:18,153
刚刚有人说平板电脑了吗?
Did somebody say something about an iPad?

28
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:20,872
啥是平板电脑啊?
What the hell is an iPad?

29
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:23,208
平板电脑都跑哪去了?
Where did they all go?

30
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,161
我猜是到淘宝上去了
I'm guessing eBay.

31
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:28,663
都给我拿回来 尤其是我那部
I want them all back, especially mine.

32
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:33,051
我在和一个在澳大利亚的女人调情呢
I'm in a casual flirtation with a woman in Australia.

33
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,921
她有一半的土著人血统 但她性格很好
She's part aboriginal, but has a great personality.

34

00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,277
给你 Earl
Here you go, Earl.

37
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:03,281
Max 出什么事了? 你看上去很开心
Max, what's wrong? You seem happy.

38
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:07,315
我还在为上周拿到的一万块钱贷款
I'm just still on a high from this $10,000 bank loan

39
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:08,953
而感到飘飘然
I got last week.

40
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:13,958
还有就是因为我在2004年吃的那个有大麻的蛋糕
And from an almost certainly laced pot brownie I ate in 2004.

41
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,450
我真不敢相信你和Caroline没有劫持人质
I can't believe you and Caroline got a bank loan

42
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,640
就能为你们的纸杯蛋糕生意
for your cupcake business,

43
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:21,560
争取到银行贷款
and not a single hostage was involved.

44
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:23,979
Max 这一万美元可不是你的
Max, you don't have $10,000.

45
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:26,065
你甚至连在线影视都看不起
You don't even have Netflix.

46
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:29,118
这钱是来生产咱们纸杯蛋糕衣服的
This money is to pay a factory to make our cupcake T-shirts,

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,237
我已经把范围缩小到三家了
and I've whittled it down to three.

48
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,288
你好
Hello.

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,390
说到缩小
Speaking of whittled.

50
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,564
有人用了我的打印机 我猜是Caroline
Someone used my printer, and I'm guessing it's Caroline,

51
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,977
因为这是关于商业的
'cause it's about business

52
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:42,569
而不是Earl的安吉拉・贝塞特的拼接画
and not another one of Earl's Angela Bassett collages.

53
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:46,824
兄弟 我能说什么呢? 我就是个贝塞特迷
What can I say, man? I'm a Bassett hound.

54
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:48,292
哦 谢谢 Han
Oh, thanks, Han.

55
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,743
这些是我正在调查的几家工厂
These are the factories I've been researching.

56
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:51,962
我们希望我们的T恤衫是美国货
We want our T-shirts to be American made.

57
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,797
我有个女佣也是个美国货
I have an American maid,

58
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,300
而她只会吃我的燕麦卷
and all she's good at is eating my granola bars.

59
00:02:57,836 --> 00:03:00,137
你看 Max 我在布鲁克林这里找到了一家
Look, Max, I found one right here in Brooklyn.

60
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,423
"美国Ace公司 创始人Ace Hardwick
"American Ace. The founder, Ace Hardwick,

61
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:04,758
致力于优待他的工人们
is devoted to treating his workers well,"

62
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,578
而不是像AA服饰老板那样变态
and not in a creepy way like that American Apparel guy.

63
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,929
你是说在那些工人里
So you're saying none of these workers

64
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:11,181
没有人被他们的老板插过吗?
have ever found an Ace in their hole?

65
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,769
听着 我在很多工厂里工作过
Look, I've worked in a lot of factories.

66
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,821
我知道这是怎么回事
I know what goes on.

67
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,323
我在一个做大衣的服装厂里干过活
I worked in a coat factory,

68
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,693
所以我的肺上才裹了一层石棉
which is why my lungs are coated in asbestos.

69
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:24,445
我在一个做内裤的服装厂里干过活
I worked in an underwear factory,

70
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:28,031
工资还低得要死
where I was underpaid for the fruits of my looms,

71
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:31,285
最糟糕的就是奶酪蛋糕工厂
and worst factory of all, The Cheesecake Factory.

72
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:33,287
哦
Oh.

73
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,955
我们要不明天再看一下
How about we do a walk-through tomorrow

74
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,623
保证一切正常?
to make sure it's up to snuff?

75
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,841
要是有啥能让我正常的
Well, if they have snuff,

76
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,511
那咱们为啥还要等到明天啊?
why are we waiting till tomorrow?

77
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:44,148
嘿 大家好!
Hey, everybody!

78
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,718
哦 嘿 嗨 我有大好消息!
Oh, hey. Hi, great news!

79
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,889
我刚在布法罗鸡翅烧烤吧点酒被查身份证了!
I just got carded at Buffalo Wild Wings!

80
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:55,976
真的吗? 我有一次还从里面被赶出来了呢
Really? I got carted out of there once.

81
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,028
我还有好消息
And more great news:

82
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,531
我也要开始我自己的新生意了
I'm starting my own new business.

83
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,201
妹子们 你们现在手头上有一万块对吧?
So girls, you know how you have that $10,000?

84
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,904
呃 我不想把你们的钱都掏空
Well, I don't want to clean you out,

85
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:10,073
要不你们就给我个9500块吧?
but how do you feel about tossing me $9,500?

86
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:15,329
你们两个应该投资 Sophie的生意真是绝妙
You two should invest. Sophie's business is genius.

87
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:18,415
你知道有很多女孩把她们下面的阴毛
You know how a bunch of ladies got their down-there-hair

88
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,751
都永久剃掉了吗?
permanently lasered off?

89
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:24,004
没错 就是把你的下面清理得锃亮
Yeah, that's when your waxer gives you a Michael Chiklis.

90
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:25,339
是啊
Yeah.

91
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:27,841
Sophie有一个产品
Well, Sophie's offering a product

92
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:30,027
可以让你的杂草丛再长回去
that puts grass back on your field.

93
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:32,162
对的
Yeah.

94
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:36,433
那才不是什么生意 没人会要这个的
That's not a business. That's nobody's business.

95
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:38,018
我才不做那种事
Yeah, I don't do any of that stuff.

96
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,605
我随便在那地方丢一撮毛就可以了
I just throw a scrunchie on mine and go.

97
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:45,192
嘿 这会有市场需求的 有时在迷雾中
Hey, there's a need for this. Sometimes, in the fog,

98
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:49,530
没有起落跑道 我的飞机会迷路的
my plane gets lost without a landing strip.

99
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:51,865
我们不加入了
We're out.

100
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:54,201
哦 女孩们 先别决定
Oh, don't decide yet, girls.

101
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:56,737
你们还没听到它可爱的名字呢
you haven't even heard the cute, little name.

102
00:04:56,739 --> 00:05:00,207
"苏菲库金斯基的阴道假发"
"Sophie Kuchenksi's Vagina Wigs!"

103
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:04,461
我们真的不加入了
Yeah, we're really out.

104
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:07,548
哦 但这绝对是个高质量的产品
Oh. But it's a quality product,

105
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,785
这还是中国进口的真阴毛呢
and it's real hair imported from "Va-China."

106
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:15,272
我们真的真的不会投资了
Yeah, never been further out.

107
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,561
这是我们的主楼层
And this is our main floor.

108
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:23,814
哇 这太棒了!
Wow, this is amazing!

109
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,600
我感觉我们是进了巧克力工厂
I feel like we're in the Willy Wonka Factory.

110
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:29,069
是啊 对吧?
I know, right?

111
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:32,456
美国王牌工厂的座右铭是"劳动最快乐"
The American Ace motto is "work is fun""

112
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,158
Max以为这工厂是另一种样子的
Max was expecting a different kind of factory.

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,411
多一点折磨 少一点桌上足球
More torture, less foosball.

114
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:41,748
是啊 对吧? 在American Ace就不会那样
I know, right? Not at American Ace.

115
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,250
你在这里的职位是什么 Peggy?
And what is your position here, Peggy?

116
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,669
你是个只会说"是啊 对吧"的人吗
Are you the "I know, right?" person?

117
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,922
是啊 对吧?
I know, right?

118
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:52,976
不 我也是这工厂的合伙人 我还负责给T恤衫染色
No, I'm one of the owners. Also, I dye T-shirts.

119
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,512
所有员工在这里工作半年后都能拿到股份
See, every employee gets a percentage of the company

120
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:59,433
所以你呆的时间越久 你的股份就会增长
after six months, so the longer you stay, the more it grows.

121
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:01,101
我们在餐馆已经工作四年了
We've been at the diner four years,

122
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:04,771
我们只看到Oleg裤子里那个东西增长过
and the only thing we've seen grow is Oleg's pants.

123
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:07,824
是啊 对吧?
I know, right?

124
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,946
呃 Ace等着你们呢 去吧 玩得开心!
Well, Ace is expecting you. Go ahead, go have fun!

125
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:17,618
嘿 不要被表象迷惑了
Hey, don't be fooled by what's on the surface.

126
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,119
你看上去好像很有钱
You look like you have money,

127
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:21,204
但我知道你的内裤已经碎成多条布
but I know your underwear's in shreds.

128
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,340
才不是多条 就一条
Not shreds, Max, shred.

129
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,126
只剩一条 从前拉到后面
Just one, it goes from front to back.

130
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,881
嗯 嗨 我们能进来吗? 门开着
Um, hi, should we just come in? The door is open.

131
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:32,299
是的 门一直都开着
Yep, always is.

132
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:35,719
门会设限 设限可不好
Doors create boundaries. Boundaries are a bummer.

133
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,137
你知道还有什么事很不好吗?
You know what else is a bummer?

134
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,058
人很高但鸡巴很小?
Tall guys with small penises?

135
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,545
你们刚好错过了高档意大利雪糕以及咖啡车
That you just missed the gelato and designer coffee cart.

136
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,981
要来个特浓咖啡榛子果仁糖味吗?
Espresso hazelnut praline?

137
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:49,866
我们不是来吃雪糕的
We're not here for gelato.

138
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,202
我们可不是不来吃雪糕的
We're not not here for gelato.

139
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:54,988
太棒了 见到你真棒
Awesome. It's awesome to meet you.

140
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,490
我是Ace Hardwick
I'm Ace Hardwick.

141
00:06:56,492 --> 00:07:00,327
听着 Ace 我们才不会给你一万美金
Look, "Ace", we're not about to give you $10,000

142
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:03,213
好让你却说装货码头旁 占那些悲伤的
so you can take advantage of a sad, underage girl worker

143
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,549
未成年女员工的便宜 就因为她胸超大
near the loading docks 'cause her boobs are crazy big

144
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,834
然后她还得自行搭车回家
and she needs a ride home.

145
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:10,387
我就"举个例子"
That's a "for instance."

146
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,722
你在说什么?
I'm sorry?

147
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,007
是这样的Ace 一涉及到工厂
See, Ace, Max has some trust issues

148
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,677
Max她就诸多怀疑 我们今天来这儿是...
when it comes to factories, so, we're here today to...

149
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,562
你现在基本上是在啃盒子了
You're pretty much eating cardboard there.

150
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,564
想再来个吗?
You want me to get you another?

151
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,350
你还没见过她吃金枪鱼罐头的样儿呢
You should see her with tuna cans.

152
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:26,103
嘿 我看到了意大利熏火腿肠
Hey, I see the prosciutto cart.

153
00:07:26,105 --> 00:07:28,689
谁想吃进口火腿?
Who wants imported ham?

154
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,190
我!
Me!

155
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:33,944
好吧 我们不是来这里啃火腿肠的
Well, we're not not here for prosciutto.

156
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:35,362
你知道什么很厉害吗?
Hey, you know what's cool?

157
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:37,948
人矮器大的?
Short guys with big penises?

158
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,368
你很有趣
You're fun.

159
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,787
你们的生意就该给美国王牌工厂
Your business belongs here at American Ace.

160
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:46,039
来 去认识一下家庭成员
Come on, let's go meet the family.

161
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,125
这个家伙有点吓人啊
That guy kind of creeps me out.

162
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:52,212
但往好处想 我终于能见家人了
On the plus side, I finally get to meet my family.

163
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:56,049
这个地方是我专门用来提供正能量
I had this space designed for open energy

164
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:57,551
和自由谈话的
and open conversation.

165
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:59,553
你们好吗 合伙人们?
What's up, other owners?

166
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,254
你好啊 Ace
What's up, Ace?

167
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:04,057
我们的销量 上升了四倍!
Our sales, by 400%!

168
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,731
Max 就这么定了 就是这家工厂
Max, this is it. This is our factory.

169
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,066
员工们看起来都很开心有成就感
The employees look happy and successful.

170
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:17,571
超级男孩的队员以前也是啊(美国歌手组合)
So did the members of 'N Sync.

171
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:21,408
但到了幕后 全是一把鼻涕一把泪
but behind the curtain, a veil of tears.

172
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,744
嘿 Caroline 意大利熏火腿在这儿
Hey, Caroline, here's the prosciutto cart.

173
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:26,246
谢谢你 Ace!
Thanks, Ace!

174
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:27,631
慢用 我要来个
Enjoy. I'm just gonna get

175
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,801
五分钟的椅子按摩
a quick five-minute chair massage.

176
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:34,004
快 趁Ace把脑袋塞到椅子屁股里之时
Come on, let's slip out while Ace has got his head

177
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:36,757
我们赶紧走
stuck in that chair's ass.

178
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,759
嘿 你好啊?
Hey, what's up?

179
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,428
欢迎来到美国王牌 我是Rico
Welcome to American Ace. I'm Rico.

180
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,648
你真是 太太太漂亮了
You're, like, really, really, really pretty.

181
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,317
啊... 哦!
Aw... oh!

182
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:51,271
总之 我是合伙人之一 负责清洗厕所
So anyways, I'm part owner, and I clean the bathroom.

183
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:55,609
小问题: 你们有醇香的解百纳吗?
Hmm, quick question: do you have a light Cabernet?

184
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:57,277
小小问题:
Quicker question:

185
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,530
你们虐待童工的密室在哪里?
where's the secret room with the toddler slaves?

186
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:04,634
你好 我叫Raul 合伙人兼保安
What's up? I'm Raul, part owner and security guard.

187
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:06,787
你们想抽空喝一杯么?
Hey, you two want to grab a drink sometime?

188
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:11,958
周五下班后 我们都在旁边的玉米饼店放松
Fridays after work, we all hang next door at Tortilla Flats.

189
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,378
玉米饼店 这不是你当脱衣舞娘的艺名吗?
Tortilla Flat. Wasn't that your stripper name?

190
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,014
你这是嫉妒我的约会对象长得高
You're just jealous 'cause mine's taller

191
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,351
而且觉得我非非非常漂亮
and thinks I'm really, really, really pretty.

192
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,137
祝你找到个高器不小的
Good luck with that tall guy scenario.

193
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:35,076
抱歉迟到了 我们在忙别的事呢
Sorry we're late, but we were busy with our other business,

194
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:37,328
我们真正在乎的事
the one we care about.

195
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,132
我怎能不接受你们"诚心诚意"的道歉呢?
How can I be mad with that sincere, heartfelt apology?

196
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,836
谁想看看我们TS样本？
Who wants to see our sample T-shirts?

197
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:47,672
我想看 但我还想看很多东西
I want to see it, but I want to see a lot of things.

198
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,341
可是由于白内障 我只能是
With these damn cataracts, the best I can do

199
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:55,546
两眼一眯看个轮廓了
is look towards it and get a milky idea.

200
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:57,181
嘿 姑娘们!
Hey, girls!

201
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:58,933
我想给你们看"周末假阴毛大放送"
I want to show you some of my new styles

202
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:02,186
收集的一些新设计
for my "Everybody's Merkin for the Weekend" collection.

203
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:04,689
Sophie 什么是假阴毛?
Sophie, what's a merkin?

204
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,108
就是阴道假发
It's a vagina wig.

205
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,445
哦 好下流
Oh, that's dirty.

206
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,699
Han 我需要你的建议
And Han, I'm gonna need your input,

207
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:18,236
因为我正开发亚洲系列产品
because I'm working on an Asian line.

208
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,705
Han在乱给建议之前
Shouldn't Han grow some hair on his

209
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:23,041
不应该先自己长点毛吗?
before he starts tossing out advice?

210
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:25,877
Han 我想知道毛的质感对不对
Han, I need to know if I got the texture right,

211
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,697
所以给我过来
so come over here.

212
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,884
哦 没错
Oh, yeah.

213
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:36,387
啊 摸起来好极了 哦
Yeah, that feels nice. Ohh.

214
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:37,805
哦
Ohh.

215
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:41,726
在我指间柔顺又茂密
Yeah, nice and thick between my fingers.

216
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,811
就是这个感觉
Oh, yeah.

217
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:47,565
慢点
Slower.

218
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:51,919
再慢点
Slower still.

219
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:55,723
这就像是在看你的沙鼠蹂躏铅笔
This is like watching your gerbil hump a pencil.

220
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:02,013
虽然没啥少儿不宜的 但真让人恶心
Not really sexual, but still grosses you out.

221
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,583
Sophie 我... 我觉得你该停手了
Sophie, I... I think you should stop.

222
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:08,002
自从三年级的易老师给我检查头虱以后
I haven't felt this sensation since third grade

223
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:10,421
我再也没有这种感觉了
when Madam Yi checked me for head lice.

224
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:15,319
记得提醒我明天给Han买那本
Remind me to pick up a "What's Happening To My Body?"

225
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,762
"写给青春期女孩"的书
book for Han tomorrow.

226
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:20,164
姑娘们 我就坐在这边
Oh, girls, I'll be over here,

227
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,800
研究我的非裔美国人系列产品
working on my African/American line.

228
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:27,989
我很纠结该叫"非草集"
Yeah, I can't decide whether to call it a "vag-afr""

229
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:33,761
还是"北美第二春"
or a "Pube-a Gooding, Jr""

230
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:39,367
Max 快看 这些衬衫太漂亮了
Max, look. These shirts look amazing.

231
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:41,619
看来我看错那家工厂了
Well, I guess I was wrong about the factory.

232
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:42,954
就像我误以为
Like I was wrong about you

233
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:46,457
你活不过第一个冬天
making it through that first winter.

234
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,292
快看 里面有张纸条
Look, there's a note in here.

235
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:51,045
哦 可能是Rico写的 他迷上我了
Oh, it's probably from Rico. He's obsessed with me.

236
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:53,297
呃 不是他
Yeah, it's not from him.

237
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,133
上面写着 "救救我们"
It says, "Help us""

238
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:59,187
低薪员工被困工厂求救 我就知道是这样!
Underpaid workers are trapped in that factory, I knew it!

239
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:02,306
我又被冰淇淋蒙蔽了双眼
Once again, I was fooled by ice cream.

240
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:04,692
没错 纸条上写着 "救救我们"
Yes, it's a note that says, "Help us,"

241
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:06,861
但是我在商科学校学到一个道理
but if there's one thing I learned in business school,

242
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:10,148
那就是 眼不见便不存在
it's if you don't see it, it doesn't exist.

243
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,902
虽然我们不想多事 但我们不能视而不见
Look, as much as we want to, we can't just look away.

244
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:17,071
我们要去找那些工人谈谈
We need to talk to the workers.

245
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:18,906
给那个认为你很漂亮的家伙打电话
Call the guy, the one who thinks you're pretty.

246
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:20,408
我不知道你说的是谁
I don't know who you're talking about.

247
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,759
我只认识一个家伙
I only met a guy who thought

248
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:24,379
他认为我很很很漂亮
I was really, really, really pretty.

249
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:26,848
我们可以在墨西哥餐厅见他们
We can meet them at that Mexican place.

250
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,000
噢 墨西哥餐厅
Ooh, a Mexican place!

251
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:32,336
我把拉丁美洲的市场给忘了!
I forgot about the Latina market!

252
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:36,147
妹子们 你们去到那里的时候记得看看
Girls, when you're there, find out if they'd be interested

253
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:38,926
他们是否对国界以南的毛发感兴趣
in some hair south of the border.

254
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:44,348
不知道你们是否想喝啤酒或者是玛格利塔
Didn't know if you ladies wanted beers or margaritas,

255
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,933
所以我们给你们拿了啤格利塔
so we got you Beer-garitas.

256
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:49,737
这要五美元呢 但你们值这个价
It's five bucks, but you're worth it.

257
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,740
我爱死了好食欲的妹子
I love a girl with a healthy appetite.

258
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:54,075
好吧 看来在我把开胃菜吃完之前
Well, you're gonna be getting down on one knee

259
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:57,111
你就要单膝跪地了
before the end of the appetizers.

260
00:12:57,113 --> 00:13:00,198
咱们就开门见山吧 工厂待你们好吗?
So let's just dive right in. How's factory life treating you?

261
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
给咱们来点内部情报... 当你们拿来这些
Give us the skinny... which is what I hope you said

262
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:03,785
啤格利塔时 我就想听你们说说了
when you ordered those Beer-garitas,

263
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:06,587
因为我的腰部赘肉还在
'cause I cannot be poor with a muffin top.

264
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,456
我不想谈论工作
You know, I don't want to talk about work.

265
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,092
你是说你们不允许谈论工作?
Oh, are you saying you're not allowed to talk about work?

266
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:14,929
你的话我们都听到了 Rico还是Raul来着
Your words, we all heard you, Rico or Raul.

267
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:16,798
嘿 告诉我 你们女孩子喜欢干点啥?
Hey, tell me, what do you girls like to do?

268
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,717
我喜欢服务员在我的桌前制作鳄梨色拉酱
Mm, I like to watch waiters make guacamole at my table.

269
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,935
那是啥时候的事?
When's that gonna happen?

270
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:25,056
那么你们的工作... 好吧
So about work... Yeah, okay.

271
00:13:25,058 --> 00:13:28,226
嘿 让我们瞧瞧啤格利塔有啥好的
Hey, let's go see what's going on in Beer-garitaville.

272
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:32,897
我们要怎么做? 我从Rico嘴里
What are we gonna do? I can't get any information

273
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,615
套不出情报 他实在是太着迷于
out of Rico. He's so preoccupied

274
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:37,068
这个很很很漂亮的我了
with how pretty, pretty, pretty I am.

275
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,403
嗨 Peggy 你们好吗
Oh, hi, Peggy. How are you?

276
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:41,572
你们想要和我们一起聊聊工作吗
Would you like to join us and talk about work?

277
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,958
不如咱们来谈谈你们两个
Why don't we talk about you two skanks

278
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,061
讨人厌的家伙赶紧滚蛋吧?
gettin' the hell outta here?

279
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:51,265
我还以为我们俩才是坏服务员
And I thought we were bad waitresses.

280
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:54,635
这个是Carmen 她也在厂里工作
This is Carmen. She works at the factory too.

281
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:57,672
我们是死党 然后她也是股东 和我一样
We're BFFs, and she's one of the owners, like me.

282
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:02,760
没错 Rico从头到脚都是她的 所以别打歪主意
Yeah, and she's a 100% owner of Rico, so hands off.

283
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:05,096
你们俩坐在这儿
We seen you two sittin' over here

284
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:07,331
自以为是他妈的上帝的宠儿
like you're God's friggin' gift.

285
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:11,335
我就知道 不是吗? 而且
I know, right? And not for nothing,

286
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:16,190
Rico的"好狗"可不喜欢别的女人
but Rico's pit bull doesn't like other girls.

287
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:20,444
我猜 那就是他的"好狗"
I'm guessing that's his pit bull.

288
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:28,119
还有你 别打Raul的主意
And you, hands off Raul.

289
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:31,956
我们的爱情是深厚真挚的
We have a love that is deep and real,

290
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,943
当他发现之时 就将会成就奇迹
and when he finds out about it, it's gonna be magic.

291
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:50,269
果然... 不出我所料
Yup... Exactly what I expected.

292
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,206
楼上是巧克力工厂
Upstairs is Willy Wonka's factory,

293
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:55,207
可是楼下却是人间炼狱
and down here, they're waterboarding Oompa Loompas.

294
00:14:57,827 --> 00:15:00,212
嘿 有事吗? 我们跟平常一样
Yo, what's up? We just comin' here to work

295
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:03,332
来染料厂上班
in the dye room right there as per usual.

296
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:06,752
耶 没什么大不了的 有什么好看的?
Yeah, no biggie. What yous twos lookin' at?

297
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,174

That was a really good accent.

298
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,226
谢谢 我可是在"油脂"里演过Rizzo
Thanks. I played Rizzo in Grease.

299
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:15,677
本来应该演Sandy 
Should have been Sandy, but I let

300
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,679
但是我让另一个跛脚的女孩演了
the girl with the limp have it.

301
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:21,233
快点 我们得穿上这个进染坊
Come on, we have to put these on and go into the dye room,

302
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:24,269
我觉得那里有着不可告人的秘密
cause I'm guessing that's where it all goes down.

303
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:25,938
染坊 不出我所料
The dye room, I'm not surprised.

304
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,240
我一直都觉得我们会混到一块儿
I always knew we'd dye together.

305
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:32,694
好的 我们就假装是在这里打工
Okay, we'll just pretend to be working here,

306
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:35,114
像我们在餐厅做的那样
like we do at the diner.

307
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,366
哇奥 看看谁来了
Well, well, look who it is,

308
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:42,287
傲慢鬼一号和傲慢鬼二号 英雄荣归
Stuck-Up and Stuck-Up Two: The Legend Returns.

309
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:46,792
Max 咱们撤吧 我不能穿着灰色赴死
Max, we gotta go. My life can't end wearing grey.

310
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:48,594
什么事 小妞?
What up, ladies?

311
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:50,796
昨晚 你们还跟小白脸出去鬼混
Last night, you're hanging with the homies,

312
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:54,466
但是今天 嘭 你们也到这儿来上班了
and today, boom, you just happen to be working here.

313
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:57,269
可真是报应啊
That's friggin' convenient.

314
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,554
我就知道 不是吗?
I know, right?

315
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:01,056
活该
Very friggin' convenient.

316
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,108
我就知道 不是吗?
I know, right?

317
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,894
我们得让她们知道谁才是老大
We just have to show them who's boss.

318
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:06,895
就像我们对待吐司机里的
You know, like we do with the mouse

319
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,730
的老鼠那样
who lives in our toaster.

320
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:13,152
那我们该怎么办 尖叫着用清洁剂喷他们?
So, what, we're gonna scream and then spray Windex at them?

321
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:16,238
嘿! 看见这个疤了吗?
Yo! See this scar?

322
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,241
为了一份冰沙 于是和五个天主教的女生挥刀打架
Knife fight with five Catholic schoolgirls

323
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:21,627
所以 除非你想跟甲乙丙丁这四人
over a slushie. So unless you want

324
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,496
以及那个最后坐轮椅的女生一样
some of what I gave Virginia, Stephanie, Laquetia, Latoya,

325
00:16:24,498 --> 00:16:28,467
不然就放聪明点
and the one in the wheelchair, I'd stay clear.

326
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:30,919
这只是一个误会
This is just a misunderstanding.

327
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,754
Rico对我没兴趣
Rico's not interested in me.

328
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:35,090
是吗 好像他昨晚对你很有兴趣吧
Well, he seemed pretty into you last night.

329
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:38,093
呃 没错 但那是在她开口讲话之前
Huh, yeah, but that's before she talked.

330
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:43,098
别这样啦 我们根本对你们的男人没兴趣
Come on, we are not interested in your men at all.

331
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,651
绝对没有 我是说 这怎么可能嘛
Not at all. I mean, come on.

332
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:47,819
什么意思?
What's that mean?

333
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:50,155
你是说 他们不够好?
You're saying something's wrong with them?

334
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:53,525
不 她是说 只是... 
No, she's not saying that It's just...

335
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:57,362
只是什么?
It's just what?

336
00:16:57,364 --> 00:17:00,332
我们是恋人
We're lovers.

337
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,288
你们俩是一对? 看起来你们不像...
You two are lovers? 'Cause you don't seem...

338
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,041
我们啥不像? 同性恋?
We don't seem what? Gay?

339
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:12,294
不像 太性感
No. Hot enough.

340
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:15,013
呃... 
Well...

341
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,882
一点都不性感
Not hot at all.

342
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:19,801
我就知道 不是吗?
I know, right?

343
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:22,387
装作很忙 精灵点
Look busy, keep your eyes open.

344
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,389
我想我们已经深入野兽的腹中了
I think we're in the belly of the beast.

345
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:27,059
你是在说我吗?
You talkin' about me?

346
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,478
不
No.

347
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:37,069
Max 你猜那扇锁着的门后面是什么?
Max, what do you think's behind that locked door?

348
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:40,489
我就知道! 可怜的俘虏
I knew it! Toddler slaves.

349
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,660
那些孩子冒着成为我的危险
Those kids are in horrible danger of becoming... me.

350
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:46,828
走吧 我们过去看看
Come on, let's go over there.

351
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,668
你他妈的... 居然敢打我!
What the... you hit me!

352
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,836
对不起 真的 是个意外!
Sorry, so sorry. Accident!

353
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:57,172
你扔东西就像个娘们一样
You throw like a girl.

354
00:17:57,174 --> 00:18:00,342
看见没 我就知道 你们根本就不是同性恋
See, I knew it, you two aren't gay.

355
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:02,511
你们就是在勾引我们的男人!
Yous are after our guys!

356
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,096
不 我没有! Rico只是觉得
No, I'm not! Rico just thought I was

357
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:05,347
我非常 非常 非常漂亮罢了
really, really, really pretty.

358
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:11,186
噢 不! 放开我的女人!
Oh, hell no! Leave my lover alone!

359

太搞笑了 我们才没勾引谁呢
This is silly. We're not after anyone.

你叫谁婊子呢 婊子!
Who you calling bitch, bitch?

370
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:51,276

Honey? You're getting carried away.

371
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,913
现在你可是真的失控了
Now you're really getting carried away.

372
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,732
噢 不! 别把我塞进烘干机!
Oh, no! Don't put me in the dryer!

373
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,900

374
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:06,575
噢! 噢!

That was a big friggin' mistake!

376
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:20,255
冷静
Respect.

377
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:21,640
你俩可比天主教学校的女学生
You two are a lot tougher

378
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,592
难对付多了
than those girls from Saint Bridget's.

379
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:28,430
哇哦 哇哦 发生了什么?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's happening?

380
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:32,100
我们要举报你 我们知道你的勾当了
We're busting you. We know what's happening here.

381
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:35,270
什么 分享利润和提供医保?
What, profit sharing and healthcare?

382
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:39,691
我们在盒子里发现了一张纸条写着 "救救我们"
We found a note in our box with "help us" scrawled on it.

383
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:41,026
你怎么解释?
How do you explain that?

384
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,028
你看了背面了吗?
Did you read the back?

385
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,946
呃 呃
Heh heh heh.

386
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:47,499
"让我们...
"Help us...

387

帮助你们...
help you...

388
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:53,622
在美国王牌发现你的潜力"
to your full potential at American Ace"

389
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:56,508
我们在每个盒子都会放这么张卡片
We put one in every box we ship.

390
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,876
我必须改一改
I have got to start reading

391
00:19:57,878 --> 00:19:59,961
只看第一句话的毛病了
more than the first sentence of stuff.

392
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,468
对不起 都是我的错
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

393
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,843
我猜我只是想去相信
I guess I just wanted to believe

394
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:11,807
有些孩子比我还惨
some kids were having a worse childhood than I was.

395
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,976
Max 别沮丧 你觉得有些人需要帮助
Max, don't feel bad. You thought someone needed help,

396
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,978
你关心他们 这说明你是个好人
and you cared, and that makes you a good person,

397
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,480
我为你骄傲
and I'm proud of you.

398
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:21,983
我只是说我很抱歉 你没必要这么刻薄吧
I said I was sorry. You don't have to be mean.

399
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:26,171
嗨 大家好!
Hey, everybody!

400
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:28,473
我刚收到第一批假发
I just got my first shipment of wigs.

401
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:34,329
Sophie 你走路怎么是这姿势?
Sophie, why are you walking like that?

402
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:37,082
因为我不仅仅是老板
Well, I'm not just the president,

403
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:39,551
我还是客人
I'm also a client.

404
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,392
Sophie 如果这东西不是波斯蟑螂
Sophie, I think you dropped something,

405
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:51,396
那么我想应该是你的东西
unless we have those giant Persian roaches again.

406
00:20:51,398 --> 00:20:55,484
即使是牛奶版的也是太过了
Even a milky version of that was too much.

407
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,861
Max 或许有一天 有一些像你一样的人
You know, Max, maybe someday, someone like you will come

408
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:08,864
会来这个充满细菌的餐厅解救我们
into this Salmonella factory and rescue us.

409
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,532
你在支票上写什么呢?
What are you writing on those checks?

410
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:12,617
"救救我们"
"Help us"

411
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:16,455
我们在这打工 "救救我们"就是指这里
We work here. The "help us" is implied.
