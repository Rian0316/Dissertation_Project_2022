老爸老妈浪漫史
第七季  第四集

10
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,520
没想到我居然会接受心理治疗
I can't believe I'm talking to a therapist.

11
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,100
我平时不太愿意表露感情
Well, usually, I'm not the touchy-feely,

12
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,890
属于喜怒不形于色的那种
talk-about-your-emotions type,

13
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,260
但目前形势严峻  我要成熟一点
but with this, I just had to be a big enough person

14
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,990
勇敢承认自己需要帮助
to admit that I need help.

15
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,700
哈  原来成熟就是这种感觉啊
Huh. I guess this is what growing up feels like.

16
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,440
这是法院强制的心理治疗
This is court-mandated therapy.

17
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,630
你袭击了一位女性  记得不
You assaulted a woman.

18
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,790
就那破事儿啊
That silly thing.

19
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,370
好吧  我们来谈吧
I guess we can talk about that.

20
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,270
祸根是几个月之前就埋下了
It all began a few months ago.

21
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,800
故事的主人公叫巴尼  我的前男友
There's this guy, Barney. We used to date.

22
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,400
分手后  我撮合他和我的女同事诺拉在一起
I set him up with this girl I work with, Nora.

23
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,500
巴尼使出浑身解数
Barney was working hard

24
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,830
努力去证明自己是绝世好男友
to prove he was real boyfriend material.

25
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,530
所以呢  我一整周都坐在那儿  眼睁睁看着
So, all week, I had to sit there watching him...

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,380
他送花
send flowers...

27
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,490
送巧克力
chocolates...

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,610
送气球
balloons.

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,160
终于有一天
Then one day...

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,320
我听说巴尼今天没送你东西
I heard Barney didn't send anything today.

31
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,330
帕崔斯说可能他有新欢了
Patrice said maybe he met somebody else.

32
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,760
这八婆管不住嘴  对吧
She's such a bitch, right?

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,620
当男人爱上女人 *
* When a man loves a woman

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,920
他的心将完全被她占据 *
* Can't keep his mind on nothin' else

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,760
绝世好男友啊
He's so dreamy.

36
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,750
帕崔斯  你给我闭嘴
Nobody asked you, Patrice!

37
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,370
不好意思
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,130
你肯定认为我无药可救了  是吧
You must already think that I'm a horrible person.

39
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,750
罗宾  我的治疗对象有很多是心理扭曲的罪犯
Robin, many of my patients are disturbed felons.

40
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,860
上周  有人还给我寄了一包他自己的米田共
Last week, one of them mailed me a bag of his feces.

41
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,000
不过往好的方面想  他至少记得我的生日
On the plus side, he remembered my birthday.

42
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,850
你算好的了
You're doing fine.

43
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,940
终于  我忍无可忍
Well, finally, I-I just couldn't take it anymore.

44
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,360
于是理智线断了
I snapped.

45
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,900
当男人  当一个男人  当这个男人 *
* When a man, when a man, when this man

46
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,230
爱上了这个女人 *
* Loves this woman

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,890
然后你怒火中烧  对其施暴
And that's when the assault occurred?

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,540
不算是吧
Not exactly.

49
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,020
所以你躲在桌底  边借酒浇愁
So, you're drunk under a desk,

50
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,810
边狂吃偷来的巧克力
binge-eating stolen chocolates.

51
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,310
天啊  我的形象顿时荡然无存  对吧
Boy, I am not coming across great here, am I?

52
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,690
现在我们不讨论你的形象
This is not about how you're coming across.

53
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,060
不过的确如此
But no.

54
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,050
为了使整件事更合理化
Okay, well, for this story to make sense,

55
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,840
我得插入我的朋友马修和莉莉的故事
I have to tell you about my friends Marshall and Lily.

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,490
这酒看上去不错
The wine looks good.

57
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,620
孕妇不许喝酒
Pregnant women can't drink alcohol.

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,260
不会啊  我的医生说
No, my doctor says it's okay

59
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,420
偶尔喝个一两口没事
to have a sip of wine every now and then.

60
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,080
是吗
Really?

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,780
桑娅医生太好了
Dr. Sonya's great.

62
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,530
每次你问她可不可以吃什么东西时  她总是说
Whenever you ask her if you can have something, she's, like...

63
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,590
亲  就一点点哦
Just a little bit.

64
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,980
慢着  桑娅医生应该不会允许你吃寿司吧
Wait, Dr. Sonya doesn't let you have sushi, does she?

65
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,610
亲  就一点点哦
Just a little bit.

66
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,710
她还让你吃玉米条啊
You're allowed to have Cheetos?

67
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,220
膨化食品啊
Cheeto..

68
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,850
亲  就一点点哦
Ah, just a little bit.

69
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,370
你们不介意我复查一下这医生说的话吧
You mind if I double-check some of this stuff?

70
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,500
以防万一嘛
Just in case.

71
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,690
我是说  身为"护子队"的一员
I mean, it's the least I could do

72
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,070
这也算是聊表寸心吧
as part of Team Baby.

73
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,260
"护子队"  哇  接下来呢
"Team Baby"? Whoa. What's next,

74
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,390
人手一件特制的劣质T恤吗
like, cheesy matching T-shirts?

75
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,900
不是
No.

76
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,090
罗宾  连环杀手都能带我去浅墓穴几个来回了
Robin, I've had serial killers lead me to shallow graves

77
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,070
你这还没进入主题呢
faster than you're telling this story.

78
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,870
好啦
Okay!

79
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,760
我越来越无法忍受与诺拉共事
Look, it was getting impossible for me to be around Nora,

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,220
所以当有摆脱她的好机会出现时
So when an opportunity to get rid of her presented itself...

81
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,150
桑迪有话说时间
It's Sandy time!

82
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,540
来来来  都听好
Huddle up, gang.

83
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,600
两件事  第一
Two things: Somebody stole

84
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,030
有人从我办公室里偷了一瓶超贵的酒
a very expensive bottle of wine from my office...

85
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,390
第二  我需要一个制片人去法国报道八国峰会的新闻
2:I need a producer to cover the G8 Summit in France.

86
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,770
诺拉可以去
Nora will do it!

87
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,950
虽然我资格比较老  不过
I mean, I know I have seniority, but...

88
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,630
我的意思也是让诺拉去
I was gonna ask Nora anyway.

89
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,980
谢谢你这么支持我  罗宾
Thanks for the support, Robin.

90
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,980
这个机会太棒了
This is huge for me.

91
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,360
你确定吗  桑迪
Are, are you sure about this, Sandy?

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,950
我可是资格老经验足啊
I do have seniority.

93
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,960
当然确定咯  诺拉太棒了
Oh, I'm sure. Nora's amazing.

94
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,530
我还想跟她滚床单呢
I want to have sex with her.

95
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,910
先是巴尼离你而去
To deal with that rejection from Barney,

96
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,880
现在连你老板也不要你
not to mention your boss...

97
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,440
你一定很郁闷
must've really hurt.

98
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,720
我们来深入分析你这些情绪吧
Why don't we dig into those emotions?

99
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,390
所以马修和莉莉在桑娅医生的办公室
So Marshall and Lily were at Dr. Sonya's office...

100
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
太神奇了吧
It's fascinating

101
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,540
原来我对阴道的了解是那么肤浅
how profoundly little I know about vaginas.

102
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,250
进来
Come in.

103
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,720
泰德  你来干嘛
Ted, what are you doing here?!

104
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,110
这位"医生"允许的事
I checked up on all the stuff

105
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,330
我都查过了  她是错的
this "Doctor" Says is okay, and she's wrong.

106
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,270
所以为了宝宝的健康成长  哥要出马了
So, for the health of this baby, I'm stepping in.

107
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,330
这个叫泰德的人好像是需要一些心理治疗了
Sounds like this Ted guy could benefit from some therapy.

108
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,760
他绝对需要
Oh, he definitely could.

109
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,420
这样的庸医是无法接受的
This is unacceptable.

110
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,580
不好意思  我们要换医生
I'm sorry, we're gonna have to find a new doctor.

111
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,030
-伙计们  为了我们孩子的健康  -关你什么事
-Guys, for the health of our baby, - Our?

112
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,240
我们得对莉莉吃的每一样东西严加把关
We have to get serious about what Lily is putting in her body.

113
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,230
顺便说一下  生孩子时
Speaking of which, when we deliver,

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,590
我们坚决不用麻药
we won't be using any drugs.

115
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,020
滚出去
Get out!

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,720
你赶我出去干嘛
Why are you kicking me out?!

117
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,910
因为你总是打扰我们的私密时刻
Because you're always intruding on our intimate moments!

118
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,650
感觉大学时期的恶梦又重新上演了
This is like college all over again!

119
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,950
你们俩把寝室弄得乱糟糟
Man, you guys sure are messy!

120
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,210
地上全是衣服
There's clothes everywhere.

121
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,250
门把手上还有一只袜子
There's even a sock on the door!

122
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,520
门把手挂个袜子是全球通用的信号
A sock on the door is a universal code

123
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,330
意思是"请勿打扰"
for "We need some space."

124
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,660
那时候你不该打扰  现在也一样
We needed it back then, and we need it now.

125
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,600
拜托  我们可是铁三角
Come on! We're a trio!

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,150
我们一直都是铁三角
We've always been a trio!

127
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,710
我们是蝙蝠侠和罗宾  以及管家阿福
We're right up there with Batman and Robin and Alfred.

128
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,870
出去
Out!

129
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,300
我们是罗密欧与朱丽叶  以及买毒药的药剂师
Romeo and Juliet and the Apothecary.

130
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,080
赶快
Now!

131
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,130
我们是盐和胡椒  以及孜然
Salt and Pepper and Cumin!

132
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,400
上面那个小东西是干嘛的
What's that little guy up there do?

133
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,350
可怜的姑娘
Oh, you poor girl.

134
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,390
罗宾
Robin!

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,610
这都是环环相扣的  我保证
It all ties together, I swear.

136
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,430
诺拉准备出发去法国了
So, Nora was about to leave for France.

137
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,620
这要是在不久前
You know, not too long ago,

138
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,670
我还会担心等我走了之后
I would have been worried that if I left you alone,

139
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,270
你会跑去跟某个金发浪女风流快活
you'd be up to no good with some blond bimbo.

140
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,230
但我已经洗心革面了
Oh, I've changed.

141
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,100
我知道  所以说我回来之后
I know, which is why when I get back,

142
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,140
我们将开启感情的新篇章
it's gonna be the start of a new chapter for us.

143
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,630
我们的关系会更近一步  希望这领带就别跟来了
A chapter of me and you and hopefully not that tie.

144
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,990
正中下怀
You got me!

145
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,870
旅途愉快
Have a nice trip!

146
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,780
斯丁森医生  我看了你的广告
Dr. Stinson? I saw your ad,

147
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,270
我是为了免费缩胸咨询而来的
and I'm here for my free breast-reduction consultation.

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,530
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

149
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,390
太大了吗
Are they too big?

150
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,820
我真不敢相信你还在钓胸大无脑的金发妹
I can't believe you're still running plays on dumb blondes!

151
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,620
我还以为你对诺拉是认真的呢
I thought you were serious about Nora!

152
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,320
我发誓  我真的变乖了
No, I've been good, I swear!

153
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,200
我只是忘记还有个系统没关掉
I just forgot about my BDSes.

154
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,940
-什么系统  -"蠢妞送上门"系统
- BDSes? - Bimbo Delivery Systems.

155
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,600
多年以来
You see, over the years,

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
我为自己量身定制了多套完美的策略
I've launched a variety of elaborate systems

157
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,060
成功地将女人一个接一个骗上床
that are always working to get me laid.

158
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,240
比如说  那个弹出式广告
Like my pop-up ads.

159
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,510
你好  我是巴尼・斯丁森医生
Oh, hi. I'm Dr. Barney Stinson.

160
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,260
你是否因为胸部过大
Are your really large breasts

161
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,050
而影响到日常生活
making everyday tasks difficult?

162
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,090
谁来救救我们吧
There's just got to be a better way!

163
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,650
救星来了
There is!

164
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,050
我  巴尼・斯汀森医生  将为您限时提供

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,460
如果你波涛汹涌得闹不住
If your knockers are just too damn big,

168
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,180
就让我带你脱离苦海吧
I can handle them... it.

169
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,950
居然会有女人相信这种东西
Women actually fell for that?

170
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,840
是啊  这生意一炮打响
Yeah. That business really took off.

171
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,500
广告还在各地播放呢
It played in all kinds of markets.

172
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,810
幸存者们  今天挑战成功的奖品
Okay, survivors, today's reward challenge

173
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,040
巴尼・斯汀森医生提供的
is brought to you by Dr. Barney Stinson's

174
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,470
免费缩胸咨询
Free Breast Reduction Consultations.

175
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,820
我的计划实在是太成功
That scam was so successful,

176
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,340
于是又衍生出了另一个产业
it spawned a related enterprise.

177
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,910
如果你曾被一个勃大茎深的男人骗财骗色
If you've been fooled by a well-endowed man

178
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,090
那人自称自己是医生
who claimed to be a doctor

179
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,000
利用提供免费缩胸咨询服务来行骗
offering free breast-reduction consultations,

180
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,090
来找我吧  阿尼・林森律师
come see me, Arnie Linson, attorney-at-law,

181
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,610
加入我的集体诉讼
and join my class-action suit.

182
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,380
如果你因为玉峰高耸而深受其害
If your giant breasts have been wronged,

183
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,720
就让我来为民除害吧
I can handle them... it.

184
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,970
她们始终飞不出我的手掌心
I got 'em comin' and goin'!

185
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,190
你居然为了骗妞上床费那么多功夫
I can't believe you go to so much trouble to get laid.

186
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,080
就是  有时候我连澡都懒得洗
Yeah, sometimes I don't even have to shower.

187
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,020
姐就喜欢重口味
Mama loves it musky.

188
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,560
我得在诺拉回来前把这些系统都关掉
I gotta shut down all these systems before Nora gets back.

189
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,530
三天内怎么可能办到
How am I gonna do all that in three days?

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,190
我会帮你
I'll help you.

191
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,400
或许你应该在你的小板子写上
Maybe you should write on your little chart there:

192
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,420
病人无私地帮助朋友
"Patient selflessly tried to help a friend in need."

193
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,230
首先  这是字谜
First of all, this is a crossword puzzle.

194
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,870
其次  很明显你计划
Secondly, you were clearly planning on using

195
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,900
利用这三天把巴尼抢回去
those three days to steal Barney back.

196
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,230
我是他的朋友  你真不要脸
I am his friend! How dare you!

197
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,790
天啊  你还真以为学富五车就能洞悉人心啊
God, you think you're so smart just because

198
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,270
上过哈佛了不起吗
you went to Harvard

199
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,100
普林斯顿又怎么样
and then Princeton

200
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,660
怎么又是哈佛  好吧  是挺牛的
and then... wow, Harvard again.

201
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,110
好吧  是的
Okay, yes, fine.

202
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,440
我是想着把他抢回去
I was... I was trying to steal him back.

203
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,430
很好  你终于肯打开心扉
This is good. You're finally opening up

204
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,410
谈谈自己的问题了
and talking about yourself,

205
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,000
而不是三句不离马修莉莉
not just what Marshall and Lily were up to.

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,350
对哦  马修和莉莉正叠衣服
Oh, yeah, so Marshall and Lily were folding laundry...

207
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,680
我真是犯贱
That one's my fault.

208
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,310
知道吗
You know...

209
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,540
没什么
Never mind.

210
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,030
只是
It's just...

211
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,940
算了
Forget it.

212
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,630
马修  你又不是三岁小孩
Marshall, you're a grown-ass man.

213
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,530
想说什么就说吧
If you want to say something, just say it.

214
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,870
我为泰德感到难过
I feel bad for Ted!

215
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,070
还有如果我老妈在这
And if my mom were here,

216
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,480
她会先问我怎么了
she would ask me what was wrong.

217
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,750
你居然为泰德感到难过
You feel bad for Ted?!

218
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,030
当电灯泡的感觉肯定让他很难受
It's tough feeling like the third wheel.

219
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,760
够了  第一  我肯定泰德没事
Okay, first of all, I'm sure Ted's fine.

220
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,590
谁会加完盐和胡椒  不再加点孜然的
Who eats salt and pepper without cumin?

221
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,910
第二  泰德指责桑娅医生真是太离谱了
Second, Ted is way off base coming after Dr. Sonya.

222
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,620
我们很喜欢她  是吧
We love her! Right?

223
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,210
别告诉我你也怀疑桑娅医生的话
Don't tell me you're doubting Dr. Sonya!

224
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,600
亲  就一点点哦
Just a little bit.

225
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,780
这是什么
What's that thing?

226
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,780
对某些女人来说  这是我父母的骨灰
Well, for some women, it was the ashes of my parents.

227
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,350
对有些来说  是温布尔登的奖杯
For others, it was the trophy from Wimbledon.

228
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,540
信不信由你  对一个波霸傻妞来讲  两者皆是
And believe it or not, for one busty dullard, it was both.

229
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,900
比赛  双波  绝配
Game, enormous set, match.

230
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,460
你好
Hello?

231
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,200
对  多谢回电
Oh, yeah, thanks for calling me back.

232
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,260
巴尼
Uh, Barney,

233
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,590
是港务局的米奇
It's Mitch from the Port Authority.

234
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,310
港务局米奇
Port Authority Mitch.

235
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,510
每当有一个怀揣百老汇梦想的
You'd always call me whenever

236
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,640
纯真乡下女孩下了巴士
a wide-eyed farm girl would get off the bus

237
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,650
你就会及时致电给我
with big dreams of Broadway

238
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,350
可怜的孩子  全然不知所谓的"选角导演"会在试镜时
and no idea what a "Casting director" could legally ask her to do,

239
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,630
合法地要求她又抱又舔
hold or lick during an audition.

240
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,520
对不起  老朋友
I'm sorry, old friend,

241
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,350
无良的导演不再需要你了
your services are no longer needed.

242
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,530
上帝啊  这么重要的事我居然用电话来结束
Oh, god, I can't believe I'm doing this over the phone!

243
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,530
巴尼一贯甩女人都是用电话

244
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,150
替我向玛吉和孩子们问好
My love to Marge and the kids!

245
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,190
我懂你  给
I know. Here.

246
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,700
-我没意识到会这么痛苦  -我懂我懂
- I didn't realize this would be so hard! - I know, I know.

247
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,640
不过  单子上列的都快搞定了
But hey, you know what? We're almost through our checklist.

248
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,330
-别伤心了  好吗  -好
- Okay? Okay?  - Okay.

249
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,390
正好提醒我了
Which reminds me,

250
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,130
为什么要我打电话给美发沙龙说
why am I calling a hair salon and saying,

251
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,380
妙手杰克要辞职
"Jack Fantastic is quitting"?

252
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,200
甜心
Sweetheart,

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,480
就像马雅・安琪罗一直对奥普拉说的
it's like Maya Angelou keeps telling Oprah,

254
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,480
马雅・安琪罗是著名女作家 诗人

255
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,290
我也一直对你说
and I keep telling you:

256
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,970
懂得越多  做得越好
When you know better, you do better.

257
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,200
哇  你好聪明哦
Wow, you are so wise.

258
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,530
真希望你是直男  我们就可以约会了
I wish you were straight so I could date you.

259
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,750
其实吧  我有个非常迷人的
As a matter of fact, I have an extremely attractive

260
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,910
直男双胞胎兄弟
straight twin brother!

261
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,800
你们好啊
Oh hi.

262
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,060
我把万圣节的照片剪了
I cropped that Halloween photo.

263
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,000
只剩盐和胡椒了  看起来荒谬至极
It's just salt and pepper, now, so it looks ridiculous.

264
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,570
-泰德  我要你回到护子队  -什么
- Ted, I want you back on Team Baby. - What?

265
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,940
我就知道你会回心转意的
I knew you'd come around!

266
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,580
伙计们  其实我没有把照片剪掉
Guys! I didn't really crop the photo!

267
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,010
好消息
Good news.

268
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,440
我为咱们报了分娩课程班
I signed us up for a birthing class.

269
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,180
你疯了吧你
Well, that's insane.

270
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,760
现在太早了  是吧  马修
It's way too early for that, right, Marshall?

271
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,820
好吧  听着  我是孩子他爹
Okay, listen. I am the father of this child,

272
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,730
我赞成去上分娩课
and I vote that we go to the birthing class.

273
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,920
想都别想
Absolutely not.

274
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,150
好吧  莉莉
'Kay, Lily.

275
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,660
是你逼我出手的
I hate to play this card...

276
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,090
如果你不去上课
but if you don't come to this class...

277
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,060
我就在床上罢工
I'm withholding sex.

278
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,370
我想她不会来了
I don't think she's coming.

279
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
是啊
Yeah.

280
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,720
她提出分开坐计程车时  我就有点儿怀疑了
I was a little suspicious when she had us take separate cabs.

281
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,650
莉莉  别吃
Lily, don't do it!

282
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,460
亲  就一点点哦
Just a little bit.

283
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,340
想想我们的孩子
Think about our baby!

284
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,020
你耍我是吧  罗宾  快说打人的事
You got to be kidding me, Robin. Get to the assault.

285
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,530
好的
Okay, fine.

286
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,310
巴尼和我把公寓收拾好了
So Barney and I were finishing packing his apartment...

287
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,230
好了  单子上的最后一项
Okay. One last item on the checklist.

288
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,830
切断随机电话5000号
Disconnect the Cold Call 5000.

289
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,580
这又玩的哪一出
What the hell's that?

290
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,270
我曾从一家专卖身体闪粉和高档乳贴的
I was able to secure the customer database from a company

291
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,880
公司搞到些客户资料
that sells body glitter and high-end pasties.

292
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,770
随机电话5000号会打给每一个
The Cold Call 5000 will dial every female client

293
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,630
22到23岁的女性客户
between the ages of 22 and 23,

294
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,360
并留下这段留言
and leave the following message:

295
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,280
你好  我知道这太疯狂了
Hi, I know this is crazy,

296
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,470
但我在地铁上对你一见倾心
but I saw you on the subway,

297
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,070
我知道这是命中注定的缘分
and I knew we were meant to be.

298
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,830
如果你相信天意  今晚到麦凯伦酒吧
If you believe in destiny, come to MacLaren's tonight

299
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,830
找我巴尼・斯丁森
and find me, Barney Stinson.

300
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,500
因为我有强烈的感觉  我应该长驱直入你
Because I have this feeling that I'm supposed to be on you--

301
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
你的心
with you.

302
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,540
为什么不重录一个正常版的
Why not re-record it?

303
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,570
我试了上百遍了  一录就不由自主说这话
I did like a hundred takes. It kept happening.

304
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,330
真不敢相信莉莉居然不来
I can't believe Lily's not coming!

305
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,880
见鬼去吧
You know what? Screw it!

306
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,760
谁说俩爷们就不能玩转分娩课了
Who says that two bros can't rock a birthing class?

307
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,080
玩转它
Rock it!

308
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,190
今天  我们来研究"肉欲马杀鸡"
Today, we'll be exploring "The Sensual Massage."

309
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,100
首先  请与搭档的手合在一起
Let's start by gently cupping our partner's hands...

310
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,170
感受彼此的呼吸
and just breathe each other in.

311
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,730
谢谢了  罗宾
Thanks, Robin.

312
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,510
我认识的人当中  只有你会帮我收拾这个残局
You're the only person I know who would help me do all that.

313
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,180
你是真兄弟
You're a real bro.

314
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,400
是吗
Am I, though?

315
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,310
女人不能算兄弟吧
'Cause I'm really more of a woman.

316
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,400
敬我的妩媚
To my femininity.

317
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,930
不  你更像兄弟
Nah, you're more of a bro.

318
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,730
你是哥们  是男人
You're a dude. You're a man.

319
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,390
你还可以享受一晚单身
Hey, you are flying solo one more night.

320
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,050
不如我换一件惹火的晚装
How about I put on a smokin' hot dress,

321
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,330
你穿上件能遮住这条煞风景的领带的马甲
you slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie

322
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,550
我们好好乐一下
and we paint the town?

323
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,910
我的意思是  我们多久没以帅哥美女之姿
I mean, when was the last time we got rip-roaring drunk

324
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,800
出来畅饮一番了
in clothing that highlights our genders?

325
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,560
所以你的计划是外出狂欢
So, your plan was to be out on the town,

326
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,310
穿着暴露
dressed provocatively,

327
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,310
以小三的身份陪他喝酒
drinking with another woman's man.

328
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,880
罗宾  这是第一次治疗
Robin, this is our first session, and

329
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,740
纯属临床意见  不过
I know this is just one clinical opinion, but...

330
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,410
高招啊
you a dawg!

331
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,320
是啊
Yeah...

332
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,360
就是有一个问题
There was just one problem...

333
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,720
惊喜吧
Surprise!

334
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,410
我提前回来了
I got back early!

335
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,830
让我猜猜
Let me guess,

336
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,540
又是躲在办公桌下大醉一场吗
you got drunk under your desk again?

337
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,900
不  哈佛先生
No, Mr. Harvard.

338
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,000
我处理的方式有所改变
I handled things a little differently...

339
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,100
我想现在  你会希望我谈谈看着巴尼与诺拉
So, I suppose now you want me to talk about how it felt

340
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,810
双双离开的感觉  对吗
watching Barney and Nora walk off together, right?

341
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,000
我更希望你直接跳到打人的正题
I'd rather just skip ahead to the assault.

342
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,000
我的下一位病人觉得他是上帝
My next patient thinks he's God.

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,080
说不定他是对的
On the off chance that he's right,

344
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,810
我可不想让上帝等着
I really don't want to keep him waiting.

345
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,330
他们离开后  劲爆的事情发生了
Well, right after they left, something crazy happened.

346
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,810
打扰下  知道在哪里可以找到巴尼・斯丁森吗
Excuse me, do you know where I can find Barney Stinson?

347
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,050
他在地铁对我一见倾心
He saw me on the subway

348
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,050
并给我留言让我来这里
and left me a message to meet him here.

349
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,740
为什么不重录一个正常版的
Why not re-record it?

350
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,160
我试了上百遍了  一录就不由自主说这话
I did like a hundred takes. It kept happening.

351
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,590
你好  我知道这太疯狂了
Hi, I know this is crazy,

352
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,070
但我在地铁上对你一见倾心
but I saw you on the subway...

353
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,200
他问我是否相信天意  我信
He asked me if I believed in destiny. And I do.

354
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,550
我们果然是命中注定的一对
We are so meant to be.

355
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,510
他在哪里
Where can I find him?

356
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,440
在道义上  我真是进退两难
So I was faced with a moral dilemma.

357
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,930
是让这傻妞去坏他们好事
Unleash this nut bag on them

358
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,850
还是风度一点  帮助我的朋友
or be a bigger person, and help my friend.

359
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,380
巴尼在真爱餐厅  75大街和阿姆斯特丹大街交汇处
Barney's at Café L'Amour, 75th and Amsterdam.

360
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,830
-太好了  -不  等等
- Awesome! - No, wait, wait, wait!

361
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,240
这样不对
Okay, this isn't right.

362
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,900
解开上面的纽扣  秀出你的本钱
Let's pop that top button, show off your gals.

363
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,090
祝你好运  冲吧
Ooh! Good luck, go get 'em!

364
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,540
让你的爱从指间流出
Let your love come through your fingers.

365
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,090
兄弟  规矩是不能哼哼
Dude, the rule is no moaning

366
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,550
而且要一直把眼睛睁着
and keep your eyes open at all times.

367
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,820
正常点
Stop being weird.

368
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,420
什么时候才轮到我当女人
And hey, when do I get to be the woman?

369
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,520
记住  怀孕过程最重要的
Now remember, the most important thing in pregnancy

370
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,170
就是让妈妈平静开心
is to keep Mom calm and happy.

371
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,330
她才知道自己最想要什么
She knows best what she needs.

372
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,600
要信任她
Trust her.

373
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,590
下面有请准爸爸
Now, Papas,

374
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,160
拉住准妈妈的手
I want you to take Mom's hands in yours,

375
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,950
深情地看着她的眼睛
look deep into her eyes,

376
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,990
跟我念
and repeat after me.

377
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,360
我相信你
I believe in you.

378
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,610
我相信你
I believe in you.

379
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,170
我尊敬你的身体智慧
I honor your body's wisdom.

380
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,380
我尊敬你的身体智慧
I honor your body's wisdom.

381
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,090
你的子宫就像一座庙宇
Your womb is a temple.

382
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,150
-你的子宫就像一座  -好啦  我知道了
- Your womb is a-- - Okay, I get it!

383
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,750
我们忽视莉莉的意愿  让我觉得好糟糕
I feel terrible we didn't listen to what Lily wanted!

384
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,980
我知道  我也是
I know, so do I.

385
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,150
其实  我一直以为结婚的会是我
The truth is, I thought I'd be married by now

386
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,930
而你们会陪着我一起经历这些事情
and going through all this stuff alongside you guys.

387
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,710
但即使我现在就遇到我的梦中情人
But even if I meet the girl of my dreams right this second,

388
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,980
我离我自己的小家庭
I'm still one night and nine months away

389
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,700
还有一晚和九个月之遥
from having a family of my own.

390
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,680
除非我孩子的妈是个荡妇
And that's assuming the mother of my children

391
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,880
否则很难一见面就上床
is just a huge slut.

392
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,910
不要失去希望  泰德
Don't lose hope, Ted.

393
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,600
那个荡妇在等着你呢
That slut is out there.

394
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,940
谢谢  伙计
Thanks, buddy.

395
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,780
我们该去跟莉莉道歉
We owe Lily an apology.

396
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,780
对
Yeah.

397
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,980
准爸爸  现在是提问时间
Dads, this is the time that I'll answer

398
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,880
你们有什么关于阴道的问题尽管问吧
every question you've ever had about vaginas.

399
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,140
擦  赶巧了
Damn it!

400
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,500
真的很抱歉  莉莉
I'm so sorry, Lily.

401
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,280
亲  就一点点哦
You have just a little bit.

402
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,970
我明白从现在开始的七个月里
I realize now that it's my job for the next seven months

403
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,940
我的职责就是要让你开心  所以
to keep you happy, and that's why...

404
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,870
我会床上当一台永动机
I'm no longer withholding sex.

405
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,780
真英雄
My hero.

406
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,800
但我想确定你也能和桑娅医生相处融洽
But I want to make sure that you feel comfortable with Dr. Sonya, too.

407
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,910
我能  而且我觉得
I do. And you know what,

408
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,220
她这么淡定从容
the fact that she's so calm and laid back,

409
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,690
或许也不是件坏事
maybe that's not a bad thing.

410
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,160
或许我们在分娩的时候
Maybe that's exactly what we're gonna

411
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,420
正需要她这种人才呢
want in that delivery room.

412
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,380
莉莉  如果你不使劲
Lily, if you don't push,

413
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,180
我会把你的宝宝挤上你的喉咙
I will shove this baby up your throat

414
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,950
然后从你的嘴巴拽出来
and pull it out of your mouth!

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,230
马修死哪儿去了
Where the hell is Marshall?!

416
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,960
孩子们  这可是个疯狂的故事
That's a crazy story, kids.

417
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,160
晚点会讲到的
I'll get to that.

418
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,390
泰德就在走廊等着呢
Hey, Ted's out in the hall.

419
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,190
他也想向你道歉
He wants to apologize, too.

420
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,520
你的袜子哪儿去了
What happened to your sock?

421
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,990
说来话长
Long story.

422
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,790
总之  我意识到有时
Bottom line, I realized that sometimes

423
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,580
爱意味着放手成全
love means taking a step back.

424
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,660
不尽然吧
Well, not always.

425
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,890
我是说  有时蓄意干扰
I mean, sometimes it's better to interfere

426
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,530
搞点小破坏会更好  不是吗
and sabotage stuff, right?

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,450
我觉得如果你真的在乎某人
Well, I think if you care about somebody,

428
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,170
即使你最后被人遗忘
you should want them to be happy,

429
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,220
你还是希望他们能够开心
even if you wind up being left out.

430
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,770
你从马修和莉莉身上得到的感悟
The lesson you learned with Lily and Marshall

431
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,410
整好适用于我现在的情况
is directly applicable to my situation,

432
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,640
因此也是
and is therefore

433
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,090
我最终讲述这个故事时  要说到的一个有用的细节
a valid part of how I'll eventually tell this story.

434
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,690
真的吗
Really?

435
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,160
所以这两件事就联系上了
That's how that went down?

436
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,820
重点就是  环环相扣嘛  对吧
Point is, it all tied together, right?

437
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,750
完全不觉得
Not really at all.

438
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,190
能不能直接说打人的部分
Can we just get to the assault?

439
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,050
敬我们
To us!

440
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,970
巴尼  是我
Barney, it's me!

441
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,150
我爱你  巴尼
I love you, Barney!

442
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,870
扇贝看起来不错
Mmm, scallops look good.

443
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,600
是不错
Oh, they are.

444
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,080
但上次我来这儿时  他们卖完了  所以
But the last time I was here they ran out, so, uh...

445
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,340
祝  你  好  运
knock... on... wood.

446
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,340
Knock on wood 是指接触木制的东西可以甩掉坏运气并确保好运

447
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,550
我要点红丝绒蛋糕作餐后甜点
Well, I have my eye on the red velvet cake for dessert.
