1
00:00:03,414 --> 00:00:05,614
会有多疼?
How much will it hurt?

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:07,683
只是取一小块皮肤当样品而已
It's just a tiny skin sample.

3
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:09,484
你看过我给自己取的
You saw me do it to myself.

4
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:12,421
那给疼痛打分的话 你打几分
On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble

5
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:15,324
一是鞋子里有个鹅卵石
in your shoe and ten is the monkey

6
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:18,126
十是被你误当成你的宠物的猴子在咬你的脸
you thought was your pet biting your face off.

7
00:00:18,128 --> 00:00:19,828
二分吧
A two.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,331
吃掉一整个薄荷糖?
Eating a whole Altoid?

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,266
Sheldon行了
Sheldon,

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,968
如果我能用我们的皮肤细胞
if I'm gonna synthesize a neural network

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,903
合成一个神经网络 我需要样本啊
from our skin cells, I need to harvest them.

12
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,472
我做过很多次了 但是如果你
Now, I've done this dozens of times, but if you're

13
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:32,007
实在害怕的话其实你可以不取的
too scared you don't have to.

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,875
不 这是为了科学
No, this is for science.

15
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:36,011
我可以为了科学变得很勇敢
I can be brave for science.

16
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:39,314
谢谢
Thank you.

17
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:41,583
哦 天哪 好凉!
Oh, jiminy, that's cold!

18
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:43,452
想想几周之后你会多开心
Just think how happy you'll be in a few weeks

19
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:44,820
当我把我们的皮肤细胞 
when I've converted our skin cells

20
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:46,355
变成功能完整的脑细胞的时候
into functional brain cells.

21
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:50,058
好吧 在你下手之前提醒我
All right, just warn me before you do it.

22
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,494
好
Okay.

23
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:54,129
三...
Three...

24
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:55,797
二... 搞定了
two... and we're done.

25
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,302
你耍我
You tricked me.

26
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:01,903
你没喊一
You didn't say one.

27
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:03,839
其实不疼 是不是? 不...
It didn't hurt, did it? No...

28
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,074
但是"三 二 然后就完事了"是不完整的
but “three, two and we're done” is incomplete.

29
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:08,010
你知道这种事会让我很闹心
You know those things bother me.

30
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:09,611
就好像听到"哒-哒-哒-哒-哒-哒"
It's like hearing “da-da-da-da-da-dah”

31
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:10,646
而没听到高潮...
without yelling...

32
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:12,314
好吧 一
Okay, fine, one.

33
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:13,982
谢谢
Thank you.

34
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,918
然后喊"完成"我们就可以走了
Now yell “Charge” and we can get out of here.

有趣的洋葱...
Fun onions...

48
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:55,059
趣洋葱(零食品牌)
Funyuns.

49
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,698
等一下
Hold on.

50
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,733
刚才是个晃动吗?
Is that a wobble?

51
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:03,267
是的
Yes.

52
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,837
显然是一个重力晃动
That's definitely a gravitational wobble.

53
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,272
啊 对不起 我可以过一会再来
Uh, sorry, I could come back.

54
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:09,307
哦 没事 没关系
Oh, no, it's okay.

55
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,374
我... 我发现了一个晃动
I... I just found a wobble.

56
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,777
哦 需要我拿拖把来吗?
Oh, do I need a mop?

57
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,546
是一个重力晃动
It's a gravitational wobble.

58
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,715
可能象征着一个太阳系外行星
It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet

59
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:20,184
可能存在生命也许某天会以我的名字命名
that may contain life and someday be named after me.

60
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:22,520
哦... 如果上面有生命
Oh... well, if it has life,

61
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:24,555
也许它已经有名字了 是吧?
maybe it already has a name, huh?

62
00:02:24,557 --> 00:02:26,190
是的 但是那个可能很难读呀
Yeah, but it's probably difficult to pronounce.

63
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:27,458
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?

64
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,894
我叫Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

65
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,063
你觉得那个行星的名字
You think it would be

66
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,132
会比这个还难读?
more difficult than that?

67
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,000
你的观点不错
Good point.

68
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,001
你的名字是?
And you are?

69
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,604
哦 Issabella Maria Concepcion
Oh, uh, Issabella Maria Concepcion.

很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you, too.

72
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:44,041
你知道 我必须说
You know, I have to say,

73
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,510
因为垃圾堆里这些糖纸
based on the candy wrappers

74
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:46,911
还有垃圾食品袋
and the bags of junk food I see

75
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,379
我还以为在这里工作的人
in this trash, I thought the person

76
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:51,115
只有十岁
working here was ten years old.

77
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:53,084
哦 得了吧 哪有十岁小屁孩懂得
Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows

78
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,586
把巧克力棒粘巧克力酱吃的快感
to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.

79
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:57,889
好样的 我只是要
Bueno, um, I'm just going

80
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:58,956
倒了你的废纸篓
to empty your waste paper basket

81
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,158
然后我就不会打扰你了
and then I'll get out of your way.

82
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,826
哦 我来吧
Oh, please, allow me.

83
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:07,498
这里有很多吃光的卡路里
That's a lot of empty calories.

84
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,733
谢谢
Thank you.

85
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,067
不客气
You're welcome.

86
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,506
好的 嗯 
Okay, uh, okay,

87
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:16,874
我... 我得走了
I... I... I have to go.

88
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:17,842
- 好的  - 祝你好运
- Okay.  - Good luck

89
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:20,678

工作顺利
future endeavors.

93
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,188
怎么样?
Did it work?

94
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,023
变成脑细胞了吗?
Are they brain cells yet?

95
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:33,624
如果你等我一分钟 我就会告诉你
If you'd give me a minute, I'll tell you.

96
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,760
哦 让我看看
Oh, just let me look.

97
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,196
哦 天哪!
Oh, my goodness!

98
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:40,598
我看到了颤动的黑线
I see quivering black lines.

99
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,133
一定是神经元
Those must be neurons.

100
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,535
哦 如此厚重如此美丽
Oh, they're so thick and beautiful.

101
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:46,437
那些是你的睫毛 走开
Those are your eyelashes, move.

102
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:51,943
嗯 Sheldon...
Well, Sheldon...

103
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:54,278
我看到了星形胶质细胞
I see astrocytes.

104
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,830
我们的皮肤细胞
Our combined skin cells are now

105
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,263
已经是一个简单的神经网络了
a primitive neural network.

106
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:03,368
我这么有
I have such a profound

107
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,770
创造力
sense of creation.

108
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:05,838
我... 就像
I ju... it's like

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,172
我孵化了一只神奇水马骝
when I hatched Sea-Monkeys,

110
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:09,575
只不过这个来自于我的基因
except that this is from my DNA,

111
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,742
所以就像是...
so this is like...

112
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:12,644
我生的水马骝
Me-Monkeys.

113
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:15,881
这些细胞来自于我们两个人
These cells come from both of us.

114
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:18,117
是的 但是叫我们生的水马骝不押韵
Yeah, but Us-Monkeys doesn't pop.

115
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,718
哦 等等!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait!

116
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,587
我们的水马骝 就叫这个了
We-Monkeys, there you go.

117
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,921
嘿
Hey.

118
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,256
我们什么时候可以在这些细胞上进行试验?
When can we start running tests on it?

119
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:26,325
我们现在就可以开始了
No reason we can't start right now.

120
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:28,694
我们应该先给它什么刺激呢?
What stimulus should we introduce it to first?

121
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:30,529
光 声 温度...
L... Light, sound, temperature...

122
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,231
哦! 哦! 我们给他们图像刺激吧
Oh! Oh! Let's expose it to images

123
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,334
让它看你和我的照片 看看它更喜欢哪个
of me and you and see who it likes better.

124
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:38,637
Sheldon 这只是一堆神经元
Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons.

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,671
我的意思是 这很有意义
I mean, it's remarkable,

126
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:41,039
但是它的能力很有限
but it's still limited in what it can do.

127
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,274
我明白
I understand.

128
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:44,676
她唱白脸 我唱红脸
She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.

129
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:51,617
啊 他们又搞错了给了我们蒸西兰花
Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.

130
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:52,417
哦 不是的 那个是我的
Oh, no, that's mine.

131
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:53,418
真的吗?
Really?

132
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,653
上次我看见你吃绿色食品
The last green thing

133
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,588
是一粒彩虹糖
I saw you eat was a Skittle.

134
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:58,524
嗯 我不能
Well, I can't eat

135
00:04:58,526 --> 00:04:59,558
总吃的像个十岁的孩子
like a ten-year-old all the time.

136
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,627
你在和别人约会 是和谁?
You're dating somebody, who is it?

137
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:02,694
什么?
What?

138
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:04,329
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

139
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,764
你只有在上床有戏的时候
You only watch what you eat when you're afraid

140
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,499
才会在意自己吃什么
you might have to take your shirt off.

141
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,868
是的 她说得对
No, she's right.

142
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,969
据我的了解
As long as I've known you,

143
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:12,404
你一直对自己的
you've always been self-conscious

144
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:14,173
乳沟很敏感
about your cleavage.

145
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:16,308
因为你一直试图
It's because you keep trying

146
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,776
往里面插铅笔
to stick pencils in it.

147
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,847
好吧好吧 那就别告诉我们
All right, fine, don't tell us.

148
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,615
可是没什么好说的啊
There's nothing to tell.

149
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,817
好吧
All right.

150
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:31,023
那西兰花好吃吗?
How's that broccoli?

151
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,058
超恶心的 但是我还是必须得吃 因为我遇见心仪对象了
It's gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.

152
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,825
哇塞
Bam.

153
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:35,027
谢谢
Thank you.

154
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,827
她叫什么名字啊?
What's her name?

155
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:36,828
她叫Issabella
Issabella.

156
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,664
哦 你是工作的时候遇见她的吗?
Oh, did you meet her at work?

157
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,533
是啊 就在望远镜室
Yes, in the telescope room.

158
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:43,435
所以她是个天文学家咯?
Oh, so she's an astronomer?

159
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:46,138
对...
Yes...

160
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,473
这就是她当时在望远镜室的理由
which is why she was in the telescope room.

161
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:49,675
是啊 这就都说得通了
Yes, this is all making sense.

162
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:50,943
很好
Good.

163
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:51,910
那很好啊 Raj
Well, that's great, Raj.

164
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:53,212
你们一定有很多共同点
You must have so much in common.

165
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:54,513
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

166
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:55,480
所以咯 我们什么时候能见她啊?
So, when do we meet her?

167
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,282
不不不 这都还为时过早
No, no, this is brand-new.

168
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,851
我们都还没正式约过会呢
We haven't even been on a proper date yet.

169
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,454
- 好吧 那祝你好运啦  - 谢谢
- Okay, well, good luck with it.  - Thank you.

170
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:05,857
你为什么从来不吃西兰花啊?
How come you never eat broccoli?

171
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:07,726
我都结婚了
I'm married,

172
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:09,695
我就不需要再有吸引力了
I don't have to be attractive.

173
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,334
你知道吗 大多数人都没意识到
You know, most people don't realize

174
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:16,668
这个技术已经出来
this technique has actually been around

175
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,370
好几年了
for a few years.

176
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:20,572
说是这么说 但我还是无法相信你能把普通的皮肤细胞
Still, I can't believe you can turn ordinary skin cells

177
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,207
转化为功能完整的大脑细胞
into functioning brain cells.

178
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,176
哎呀 我可是把这家伙变成了一个功能完整的男票的人嘛
Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend,

179
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,477
所以 我就是无极限
so sky's the limit.

180
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:30,082
快看 快看 我就在这儿啦
Look, look... here I am

181
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:33,118
就站在孵化器旁边
standing next to the incubator.

182
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,222
然后这里是显微镜下细胞的样子
Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.

183
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:41,193
快看啊 把它们放进一个迷你的闪电侠T恤里面那就变成你啦
Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it's you.

184
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,996
是啊 这个小家伙
Oh. Yeah, this little guy

185
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:45,364
已经可以辨别
can already recognize

186
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:47,099
电子传输的图像啦
electronically transmitted images

187
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:50,402
比Amy实验室里的所有其他样本都要快20%
20% faster than any other sample in Amy's lab.

188
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,272
我对于表现出兴奋已经黔驴技穷了
I'm running out of ways to act excited.

189
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,610
好啦 说我们都说够啦 你们现在怎么样啊?
So, enough about us, how are things going with you?

190
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:00,379
很好 医生说现在宝宝的头
Great, the doctor said the baby's head

191
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:01,580
朝着下方了
is facing down now.

192
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,015
很好嘛 你知道啦
Good, you know,

193
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,684
万一找不到出口呢
in case the exit isn't clearly marked.

194
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:09,121
是啊 我必须得说 能够跟某些有着
Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share

195
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,257
相同旅程的人分享经验还是挺好的
this experience with someone who's on the same journey.

196
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,995
虽然现在我们的娃已经是细胞中翘楚
Although right now ours is testing off the charts

197
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:20,098
而你们的还在它自己产生的垃圾当中翻滚
while yours is floating around in its own waste.

198
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:24,603
你是真的在把我的人类宝宝
Are you actually comparing my human baby

199
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:27,105
跟你碗里的大脑细胞作比较吗?
to your brain in a bowl?

200
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:29,474
我逼着你摇摇摆摆
Well, I didn't make you waddle up

201
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,810
爬了四层楼当然是有原因的
four flights of stairs for the heck of it.

202
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,747
你要知道我的宝宝有着功能健全的器官
You do realize my baby has functioning organs

203
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,349
而且还能辨认声音吧
and can recognize voices.

204
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,485
是啊 可是我们的能从背景噪音中
Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream

205
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:42,387
辨认出特定的数据流啊
among background noise.

206
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:44,423
我的宝宝有发育健全的
Mine has a fully developed

207
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,490
免疫系统
immune system.

208
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:46,558
我们的宝宝不需要
Ours doesn't need

209
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,093
免疫系统 因为它活在
an immune system because it lives

210
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:50,062
最先进的德国孵化机里面
in a state-of-the-art German incubator.

211
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:52,030
Sheldon 够了
Sheldon, that's enough.

212
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:53,432
行 好吧
Oh, yeah, no, fine.

213
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,267
那我们就只要同意 双方的创造
Let's just agree that both creations

214
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,935
都以自己的方式特立独行好了
are special in their own way

215
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:59,371
不去傻傻地比较他们了
and it is foolish to try and compare them.

216
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:01,073
不过 我们可不用为了我们的宝宝
Although, we didn't need to have sex with Howard

217
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,407
跟Howard啪啪啪 所以还是我们赢
for ours, so we win.

218
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:07,846
这很有趣啊
This is fun.

219
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:13,552
我以前从来没清理过马桶
I have never cleaned a toilet before.

220
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:14,586
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

221
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:16,188
不 我从小在满是佣人的屋子长大
No, I grew up with a house full of servants

222
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,689
然后现在我家有个清洁女工...
and now I have a cleaning lady...

223
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,758
她是个可爱的女人
who is a lovely woman

224
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,660
我极其尊重她
who I have great respect for.

225
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:25,464
没关系的 你可以有一个清洁女工的啦
It's okay, you're allowed to have a cleaning lady.

226
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,965
那太好了 因为她还帮我遛狗
Oh, good, because she also walks my dog,

227
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:29,434
帮我买吃的 还帮我剪头发
buys my groceries and cuts my hair.

228
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,270
我觉得那应该叫妈妈才对
I think that's called a mommy.

229
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:34,973
呃...
Uh...

230
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,242
好吧 原谅我...
So, forgive me...

231
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:38,543
原谅我的八卦
forgive me for being nosy,

232
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:39,911
但是你那双漂亮的橡胶手套之下
but is-is there a wedding ring

233
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:41,880
是有一个结婚戒指吗?
under those pretty rubber gloves?

234
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,550
不 我单身很多年了
No, not for many years.

235
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:48,186
哦 所以你现在了无牵挂吗?
Oh, so, you are unencumbered?

236
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,221
就只有我和我儿子
Just me and my son.

237
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,123
我可爱孩子了 他多大了?
I love kids, how old is he?

238
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,291
十九
Nineteen.

239
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:57,329
这可是个可爱的年龄啊
That's a cute age.

240
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,031
他们能做的可多了
They can do so many things.

241
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,733
他在加州大学洛杉矶分校念书
He's studying to be

242
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,468
准备当律师
a lawyer at UCLA.

243
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,669
那太棒了
That's wonderful.

244
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,838
律师 我姐姐就是律师
A lawyer, my sister's a lawyer.

245
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,874
快看 我们有共同点啦
Look at that, we have something in common.

246
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,675
是啊 看来是这样
Yeah, I guess we do.

247
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,845
说不定我们还有别的共同点呢
Maybe there are other things we have in common.

248
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:17,783
到晚餐的时候 你享受吃东西吗?
C-Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?

249
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,485
哎呀 Rajesh啊
Ay, Rajesh,

250
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:22,788
我觉得你非常贴心 但是
I think you're very sweet, but 

251
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,991
我做着两份工作 根本没时间约会
I work two jobs and I don't have time for dating.

252
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:27,826
是啊 肯定的 我理解
Yeah, sure. I understand.

253
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,394
对 我也很忙的
Yeah, I'm very busy, too.

254
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,163
千万别往心里去 这不是针对你个人
Oh, please don't take it personal,

255
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,998
我觉得你是个非常好的男人
I think you're a very nice man.

256
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,767
我觉得你也非常好
I think you're very nice as well.

257
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:37,636
谢谢你帮我
Thank you for helping me.

258
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:39,237
晚安 Rajesh
Good night, Rajesh.

259
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,239
哦 是啊 好

00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,974

晚安
Good night.

262
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:50,449
我也不知道为什么
I don't know,

263
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:53,652
可能是由于小便池里洁厕块产生的烟雾吧
maybe it's the fumes from the urinal cakes,

264
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,555
但我觉得我们之间有感觉啊
but I feel like something is happening between us.

265
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:59,057
晚安 Rajesh
Good night, Rajesh.

266
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,626
好吧 我会走的
Okay. I'll leave.

267
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,962
但是你要知道 每当我来到这里
But just know, every time I come in here,

268
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,464
我就会想起你
I'll be thinking of you.

269
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:13,205
你快看看好吗?
Would you look at that?

270
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:16,241
我们给它的图片有45%的白噪音
The image we gave it was 45% white noise,

271
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:18,143
而它还是成功复制出来了
and it still managed to reconstruct it.

272
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:20,078
我从来没见过这样的结果
I've never seen results like this before.

273
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,947
是啊 我们得在回家路上买些磁铁
Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home;

274
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:24,416
这必须得上冰箱
this is going right on the fridge.

275
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:26,451
你不高兴自己参与了这个吗?
Aren't you glad you participated in this?

276
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:27,752
我高兴啊
Oh, I am.

277
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,855
那你知道我们的下一步是什么了吗?
And you realize what the next step is?

278
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:31,623
建立第二个环境
Set up a second culture

279
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,625
然后尝试复制我们的结果
and try to replicate our results.

280
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:35,460
呃 不
Uh, no.

281
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:37,062
我们应该把那扇门锁上
We lock that door,

282
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:39,798
拉下我们的内裤然后造个宝宝
lower our underpants a little and make a baby.

283
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:55,111
造个宝宝? 你在说什么呢?
Make a baby? What are you talking about?

284
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,615
很明显 我们DNA的结合体特别优秀啊
Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional.

285
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,984
我们的结晶也许能
Eh... Our child could be the next step

286
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,686
引导人类的进步
in the evolution of mankind.

287
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:05,622
这样... 它想上哪家幼儿园就能上啦!
We... we'll be able to get into any preschool we want!

288
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,325
Sheldon 我没准备好要孩子
Sh-Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.

289
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:10,861
你准备好了 我记录了你的生理期
Oh, yes, you are! I track your cycle.

290
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,197
在接下来的36个小时
For the next 36 hours you're as fertile

291
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,267
你的繁殖力将会和施了肥的麦田一样强
as a manure-covered wheat field.

292
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:20,770
哇 我... 我甚至都能感觉到
Wow. I... I can actually feel

293
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:23,740
卵子正吓得往回爬
the egg crawling its way back up.

294
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:26,877
这我就不懂了
I don't understand.

295
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,346
我以为和我一起造人你会很激动呢
I thought you'd be thrilled to procreate with me.

296
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:31,047
- 这会儿不合适  - 哦
- Not right now.  - Oh,

297
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:32,816
我知道是怎么回事了
I see what's happening here.

298
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,952
你在吊我胃口
You're playing hard to get.

299
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:38,288
我没在吊你胃口
I'm not playing anything.

300
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,290
我们今天不能要小孩
We're not making a baby today.

301
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,492
好吧
Very well.

302
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,963
嗷 宝宝真是太不小心了
Oops, how clumsy of me.

303
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,366
我把它捡起来吧
You know what? Let me get that.

304
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,477
嘿
Hey.

305
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,711
你要去哪?
Where are you going?

306
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,346
我...
I...

307
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,049
你看了一眼我的屁屁没?
Did you even look at my bottom?

308
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,821
欢迎
Welcome.

309
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,825
- 这是什么情况?  - 嗯
- What is this?  - Oh, well,

310
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:18,261
你说你没时间去外边吃饭 我想着
you said you didn't have time to go out for dinner, so I thought

311
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,796
那就在这里吃呗
we could have one right here.

312
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:22,332
- Rajesh...  - 来嘛!
- Oh, Rajesh...  - Oh, come on!

313
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,466
我们在望远镜室!
We're in the telescope room!

314
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:26,002
这感觉就像在星光下共进晚餐
It'll be like dining under the stars.

315
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:27,604
你...你看到这 呃 这两个零了吗?
Y...You see this, uh, double zero?

316
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:31,141
“01“表示它正在闪烁
When it says “01,” that means it's twinkling.

317
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,816
有时候它反应比较迟钝
Sometimes it takes a while.

318
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,552
Rajesh 这真是太贴心了
Rajesh, this is so sweet,

319
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,487
但是 我现在正在工作
but you... you know I'm working.

320
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,989
所以我把这里都整理干净了
That's why I already cleaned up in here

321
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:47,657
走道里的其他房间也打扫了
and all the other rooms in the hall.

322
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:53,029
那可帮我省了点时间呢
Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.

323
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:54,564
坐吧!
Oh, please sit!

324
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,034
我试着做了你的家乡菜
I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.

325
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,169
真的吗?
Oh, really?

326
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,204
你做了古巴菜?
You made Cuban food?

327
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:06,209
额 这得看... 古巴有墨西哥菜吗?
That depends... do they have Mexican food in Cuba?

328
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:11,548
他说“造人“的时候
Now, when he said “make a baby”"

329
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,051
有没有可能指的是用乐高积木造?
is it possible he meant out of Legos?

330
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,854
不 他说得可明白了
No. He was explicit.

331
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:20,824
明白得诡异至极而且完全没必要嘛
Needlessly and freakishly explicit.

332
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:23,994
他想要小孩做啥子呢?
Why does he need a baby?

333
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:27,063
他本人已经头发光光 一股爽身粉味了啊
He's already hairless and smells like talcum powder.

334
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,300
你俩真的会生出那种
Could you two really have some sort of

335
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:32,068
智商超群的宝宝吗?
super-intelligent child?

336
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,703
基因是一部分
Well, there is a genetic component,

337
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:35,438
但是也不能保证
but that doesn't guarantee anything.

338
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,873
对的 Sheldon的爸爸
That's true. Sheldon's father

339
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,776
还和仙人掌打过架呢
once picked a fight with a cactus.

340
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,778
但是那只是他的凡人父母啊
Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents.

341
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,881
他的外星人父母我们可是一点都不了解呢
We don't know anything about the ones that sent him here.

342
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:49,753
可我们知道他们都聪明到可以把他送走啊
Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.

343
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:53,223
嘿 你们讽刺的可是
Hey, you're talking about the person I love

344
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:57,027
我躲了三个小时的爱人诶
and have been avoiding for the past three hours.

345
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,229
嗷 天啊
Aw, man.

346
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:01,431
哦!
Ooh!

347
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,700
Sheldon有甜头尝了
Sheldon gonna get some.

348
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,203
好好享受
Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's

349
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,439
二号门后的噩梦吧
behind door number two.

350
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,025
嗨 你好啊
Well, hello.

351
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,295
嗨
Hello.

352
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,531
想来点白兰地吗?
Would you care for a brandy?

353
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,865
不想
I don't think so.

354
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,702
好主意 难喝死了
Good choice, it's disgusting.

355
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:43,506
Sheldon 别挑逗我了好不好
Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.

356
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,774
谁挑逗你了?
Who's trying to seduce you?

357
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,377
一天结束之后 我总是会放上一点爵士
After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz

358
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:51,915
再在大腿内侧喷点麝香
and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.

359
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,520
闻着一股野生动物园味儿
I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.

360
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,290
你想野一下吗?
Anything you'd like to pet?

361
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:03,693
头发不行哦 上面发胶太多了
Not my hair. There's a lot of goop in it.

362
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,429
我受够了
Okay, I've had enough.

363
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,932
Amy 回来
Amy, come back.

364
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,434
我不懂怎么开牡蛎啊
I don't know how to open the oysters.

365
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:16,506
你第一次来美国的时候
So, um, what surprised you the most

366
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,208
最让你惊讶的事是什么?
when you first came to America?

367
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,578
大概是有多少人在意
Well, I suppose how much people care

368
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,380
奥普拉的完美清单吧
about Oprah's favorite things.

369
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,915
我也这么觉得诶
I thought that, too.

370
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:27,550
之后我有了自己的第一台华夫饼机
But then I got my first waffle maker

371
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,385
就没再怀疑过她了
and never questioned her again.

372
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,020
嗯
You know,

373
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:33,590
我这周天挺闲的
I do have some time off this Sunday

374
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,325
- 如果你想...  - 嘿! 我看到你的车...
- if you'd like to...  - Hey! I saw your car...

375
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:38,161

Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?

376
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:38,975

Oh, yeah, the astronomer.

381
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,904
Raj和我们提过你呢
Raj told us about you.

382
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,407
免费的厕纸!
Hey! Free toilet paper!

383
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,479
你跟他说我是天文学家?
You told him I was an astronomer?

384
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,580
呃...
Uh...

385
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,715
我明白了
I understand.

386
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:00,316
- 我该走了  - 别...别走啊
- Time to go.  - No, p...please don't.

387
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:02,285
没事的 Rajesh 我是成年人
It's okay, Rajesh, I'm a grown woman.

388
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,586
没必要和
I don't have to waste my time

389
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,421
觉得我丢人的人浪费时间
with someone who's embarrassed by me.

390
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:11,327
这玩意我可以留着 对吧?
I can keep this, right?

391
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,563
喂 Issabella!
Issabella!

392
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,064
Issabella 等等 你听我解释
Issabella, wait, wait, let me explain.

393
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,567
要觉得我的工作很丢人的话
If you are embarrassed by what I do,

394
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,836
- 为什么又要追我呢?  - 对不起
- why did you pursue me?  - I'm sorry.

395
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:22,705
说实话 我...我本来没觉得你的工作会困扰我
Honestly, I...I didn't think your job would bother me,

396
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:24,040
但事实好像不是这样
but I guess it did.

397
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,742
我也因此很恨我自己
And I hate myself for that.

398
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:27,210
但是我的很多事
But there's a lot of things

399
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,279
也会让你觉得很丢脸的
about me that would totally embarrass you.

400
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,580
我不信
I doubt that.

401
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,482
准备好丢脸丢到家吧
Well, prepare to be mortified.

402
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:35,652
我把狗粮含着 喂给我狗狗
I let my dog eat food out of my mouth,

403
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:38,321
不是因为她喜欢而是因为我喜欢
not because she likes it but because I do.

404
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:42,492
还有 尽管蝴蝶很好看 但是我超害怕它们的
Also, I know they're pretty, but I'm scared of butterflies.

405
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:44,427
不好意思哈 只是路过
Sorry, just passing through.

406
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:46,596
这是从你车上掉出来的
I think this fell off your cart.

407
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,867
好嘛 你意下如何?
Come on. What do you say?

408
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:52,502
让我补偿你嘛
Let me make it up to you.

409
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,804
你是挺执着的
You're very persistent.

410
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,307
我也只会这一招
It's my one move.

411
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,375
好吧
Okay.

412
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,178
这周天晚上 你可以带我去
This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner

413
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,446
一家豪华餐厅吃饭
at a nice restaurant.

414
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:05,949
好啊 你想去哪?
Great. Where would you like to go?

415
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:07,150
你挑吧
Your choice.

416
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,519
如果你喜欢的话 可以吃巴基斯坦菜
It can be Pakistani food, if you like.

417
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:11,154
呃 可是我是印度人
Excuse me, but I'm Indian.

418
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,323
你现在知道被冒犯是什么滋味了吧
And now you know how it feels.

419
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,216
难道你一点性致都没有吗?
So, were you turned on even a little bit?

420
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,284
感觉就像
It was like

421
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:30,654
被鼠帮皮威·赫曼打了一样
being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.

422
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,324
不好意思 这是在说是吗?
I'm sorry, is that a yes?

423
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,360
不是!
No!

424
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:37,961
Amy啊
Amy,

425
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:40,497
我不想这么干的
I didn't want it to come to this.

426
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:42,366
但你真是逼得我毫无办法
But you have left me no choice

427
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:44,301
只能用最最热情
but to employ the most passionate,

428
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,870
撩人的舞蹈了
seductive dance known to man.

429
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:52,242
弗拉明戈
The flamenco.

430
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:08,759
天哪
For God's sake,

431
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,928
你简直逗死了
you're ridiculous.

432
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:17,621
你俩觉得性致勃发 对吧
You guys are aroused, right?

433
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,425
好险啊
That was a close one.
