1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,960
你的巴尼叔叔总是有点神秘
Your Uncle Barney was always always a bit of an enigma.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,740
住在纽约的那些年里
In all the years we lived in New York,

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,460
我们当中没有一个人踏进 过他家的门槛
none of us had ever set foot in his apartment.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,640
直到那天 某人甚至出现他的床上
Until one day, one of us did.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,050
这是个有趣的故事
It's a pretty good story.

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,940
信不信由你 这一切和酒精都没有关系
And believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,760
所有的一切都开始于两周前 给莉莉的乔迁派对上
It all started two weeks earlier at Lily's housewarming.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,210
两周前
Hey, welcome to my new home.

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,260
欢迎光临寒舍

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,040
莉莉 这就是
Oh, wow, Lily, this is...

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,300
你的新公寓就这样?
Oh, this is all of it.

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,950
是的 我知道是小了点 不过这就是特点
Yeah, I know it's small, but it's got character.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,720
谢谢
Thank you.

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,230
我最近在跟邻居学立陶宛语
And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,080
他们真是太有意思了
They're great.

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,710
你也看见了 他们总是在大堂那
They're always out there in the hall, you know,

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,420
做饭 打牌 还相互剪头
cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts.

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,910
真有趣
It's nice.

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,210
你的厨房和厕所是一起的?
Hey, is that a toilet in your kitchen?

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,390
或者说炉子在你浴室?
Or a stove in your bathroom?

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,960
这个不是一般的炉子
Oh, that's not just a stove.

22
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,630
这是炉皇(stovenkerator＝ stove+oven+sink+refrigerator)
That's a stovenkerator:

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,590
它集火炉 水池 烤箱还有冰箱为一体
a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator.

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,930
炉皇
Stovenkerator.

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,430
是不是很酷啊 超现实主义
Isn't that futuristic?

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,880
我的神啊 怎么这样
God, I hope not.

27
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,620
墨菲床很酷啊 (墨菲床：一种不用时可折起放进壁橱的床)
Hey, cool Murphy bed.

28
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,970
是啊 有点乱 今早懒得整理了 所以
Yeah, it's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...

29
00:01:05,988 --> 00:01:07,323
Oh!

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,630
你知道吗? 有个新说法
You know what, I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you.

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
以这个角度入睡对身体有利
For some reason.

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,050
我明白了
I got it.

33
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,100
他是说 什么 什么 我就要 什么 什么
That was, something, something, I am going to, something,

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,230
你是一个 什么 什么 驴
you like a, something, donkey.

35
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,720
Huh.

36
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,890
多么奇特的文化啊
Other cultures.

37
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,730
不要管他了 我来看看你们送的果篮
Hey, let's break out the fruit basket.

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,860
奇怪?有谁吃把它吃了
Hey, who ate all the...?

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,820
最终我们不得不从莉莉的房间逃离 她有个老鼠室友
Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.

44
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,100
我想让她来我那住 可是我有只狗 她对狗毛过敏
I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.

45
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,440
狗?  我跟她前男友住一起 她对那个估计更敏感
Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.

46
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,970
你那可以吗?巴尼 我知道你那里很神秘
What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery,

47
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,160
但肯定会有个沙发
but it's gotta have a couch.

48
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,480
想住巴尼超人的城堡？没门! (他把fortress of solitude 改称fortress of barnitude  把自己比作超人)
The Fortress of Barnitude? No way.

49
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,910
别这样 她很惨啊
Come on. She's desperate.

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,040
我对我要带回去的女人是有条件的
Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home,

51
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,620
但是 她不予考虑
but... pass.

52
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,010
你们当中的一个人非常非常走运
One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have...

53
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,480
因为有张多的艾拉妮丝・莫莉塞特演唱会的票 谁想去?
a boom, an extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?

54
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,970
- 很明显 没有 - 不
- Absolutely not. - No.

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,940
见鬼! 大概一个月前我就搞到票了 当时想和莉莉一起去
Damn! I got these tickets, like, months ago for me and Lily

56
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,300
现在想找个伴都找不到
and now I can't find anyone to go with me.

57
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,280
所以很怀念以前成双入对的日子
This is what I miss about being in a couple.

58
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,250
这样总有人可以陪我去演唱会
I always had someone to go to concerts with,

59
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,840
去菜市场
or farmer's market,

60
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,430
还有早午餐
or brunch.

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,070
上帝  我上午没有吃饭
God, I miss brunch!

62
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,060
这样的话我认为你可以自己吃早午餐
Well, I guess you could-- well, you could try going to brunch alone.

63
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,170
你认为我没有试过?
Oh, you don't think I've tried?

64
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,850
一位
Table for one.

65
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,160
一对?
One couple?

66
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,530
不 就我一个人
Um, no, just me.

67
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,930
真的?
Really?

68
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,730
一个人的早午餐?
For brunch?

69
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,880
对 我不是开玩笑
You're right. Who am I kidding?

70
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,250
波普餐厅 真是个好地方 明天我们去吃早午餐吧
Ooh, The Popover Pantry. That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?

71
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,640
可以啊 亲爱的
Of course, sweetie.

72
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,850
我能跟你们一起去吗?
Can I go with you guys?

73
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,480
确定?跟我们去吃早午饭?
Really? For brunch?

74
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,130
上帝!我讨厌单身!
God, I hate being single!

75
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,350
好吧 我赌匹兹堡赢
Okay, I'll take the over on the Pittsburgh game.

76
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,580
匹兹堡对西雅图　两个星期以来
Oh, and P. to the S., I never got my payout

77
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,640
我就没在西雅图上面赢过钱
from Seattle from two weeks ago.

78
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,860
好的  不要逼我向赌博委员会投诉你
Yeah. Don't make me call the gaming commission on you.

79
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,970
我肯定他们会对这很感兴趣
I'm sure they'd be very interested to know what's going on over there.

80
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,680
好吗?明白吗?
All right? All right?

81
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,600
我也爱你 妈妈 多保重
Okay, I love you, too, Mom. Take care.

82
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,020
莉莉! 你好
Hello,  Lily.

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,320
你成功的获取了我的机密
You've somehow managed to circumvent my security.

84
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,170
你怎么做到的
How did you do it?

85
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,900
泰德把备用钥匙给我了
Ted gave me your spare key.

86
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,010
备用钥匙! 太聪明了!
Spare key, brilliant!

87
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,200
我很不好意思 不过我也就只能来这了
I'm sorry, but you know I'd only come here

88
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,280
我没别地儿可去了
if I had no other choice.

89
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,040
今晚  我正准备早点睡觉的时候
But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...

90
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,210
你好 （立陶宛语）
Sveikas.

91
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,340
太糟了
That's terrible.

92
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,050
好吧 改天见
Well, see ya.

93
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,270
晕 我今晚不能留下吗?
Well, can I stay here maybe?

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,760
我很愿意 但是房间不够
Oh... I'd let you, but I don't have any room.

95
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,840
但是你住的是两室的房间啊
You live in a two-bedroom apartment.

96
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,670
你用一间屋子专门放衣服
You have one room just for your suits.

97
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,680
在我生命里 我的衣服也是家庭成员
Hey, I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family.

98
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,740
莉莉 看看周围
Look around you, Lily.

99
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,370
你现在置身于 一个单身汉的国度
You are in the heart of bachelor country,

100
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,700
作为一个女人 你在我这里是不受欢迎的
and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here.

101
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,740
现在你可以申请一张只有 12小时的"性"签证
Now, you can try to apply for a sex visa, but that only lasts 12 hours.

102
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,890
如果你床上功夫好的话 还有长达14小时的多次往返签证
14 if you qualify for multiple entry.

103
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,920
要是单纯的小女生肯定说 "不会吧"
Eww... is something some lame, judgmental chick would say,

104
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,730
但是我要得到多次往返签证 来　击掌
but I say give me multiple high fives.

105
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,180
哇　你真是不顾一切
Wow, you really are desperate.

106
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,370
那确实
I really am.

107
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,300
好吧 你可以待两天
Okay, you can stay here for two days.

108
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,320
只有一条你要遵守 不能乱动我的东西
But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.

109
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,490
我没有理由乱动你的东西 这里真是...
Why would I change anything? This place is...

110
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,530
...完美
...perfect.

111
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,850
除了你没有电视这个事实
Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.

112
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,900
看见那面墙了吗?
See that wall?

113
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,540
300寸的液晶电视
300-inch flat-screen.

114
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,460
只有东京有卖的 但是我有个熟人
They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy.

115
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,270
用了一艘可以装下金刚的船 才把它弄回来的
Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.

116
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,730
亮的晃眼睛
It hurts my eyes.

117
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,670
是啊 这光无法关掉
Yeah. That doesn't go away.

118
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,080
- 嘿 - 嘿 你去哪了?
- Hey. - Hey, where have you been?

119
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,810
艾拉妮丝・莫莉塞特的演唱会
The Alanis Morissette concert.

120
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,890
一个人?
By yourself?

121
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,210
事实上我是和一个法学院的朋友去的
No, actually I went with a friend from law school.

122
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,570
真的?她是谁啊?
Oh, really? Who's this friend?

123
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,350
布莱德
Brad.

124
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,640
- 兄弟  艾拉妮丝・莫莉塞特摇滚? - 完全正确
- Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks! - Totally!

125
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,370
不可思议吧 我今晚差点就不能来了
I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.

126
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,170
我猜  这两张票是你打算和莉莉一起去的
Let me guess: You bought the tickets for you and Lily

127
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,680
在她甩了你之前
right before she dumped you.

128
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,550
是啊 你怎么知道的
Yeah, how'd you know?

129
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,340
我也才被甩了
I just got dumped myself.

130
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,030
什么?卡洛跟你分手了?
What, Kara broke up with you?

131
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,120
很遗憾 这太郁闷了
I'm sorry, man. That sucks.

132
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,020
布莱德你喜欢早午饭吗?
Brad, do you like brunch?

133
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,630
你请他吃早午饭?
You invited him to brunch?

134
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,060
是啊 我请了 有问题?
Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why, is that weird?

135
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,940
是的 问题就在于 你邀请他一起吃早午饭
Yes. That's why I was all, "You invited him to brunch?"

136
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,560
为什么朋友就不能去吃呢?
Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?

137
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,050
因为这个有点
Because brunch is kind of...

138
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,490
娘娘腔
G irly.

139
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,980
娘娘腔?早餐不娘娘腔
Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.

140
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,480
午饭不娘娘腔 偏偏早午餐有?
Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?

141
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,440
我不知道
I don't know.

142
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,310
比如说马听起来娘娘腔
There's nothing girly about a horse.

143
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,130
角也没有
Nothing girly about a horn,

144
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,830
但是独角兽听说来就娘娘腔
but put them together and you get a unicorn.

145
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,220
管你们怎么说
I don't care what either of you say,

146
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,540
我要和布莱德去波普餐厅
I am going to The Popover Pantry with Brad.

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,330
我们去了 我们饿了
We're here. We're hungry.

148
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,770
习惯早午餐吧
Get used to it, brunch.

149
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,160
-闻起来真香 - 谢谢夸奖
- Hmm... smells delicious. - Thank you.

150
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,820
冰箱里没有吃的了 所以我买了点
There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...

151
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,510
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

152
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,430
莉莉 再重复一遍规矩
Lily, what was the first rule again?

153
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,690
不要乱动任何东西!
Don't change anything.

154
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,470
那第二条是什么?
And what was the second rule?

155
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,260
-规则二 没有规则二? - 是的!
- There was no second rule. - Exactly!

156
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,390
这里只有一条规则 而你破了规矩
There was only one rule and you broke it.

157
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,740
我买食物 这个也算?
I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?

158
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,950
莉莉 如果我想要冰箱 里放满了食物
Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries,

159
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,920
或者早上有新鲜的咖啡
or fresh coffee in the morning,

160
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,130
那我早就去找女朋友了
I'd be in a relationship.

161
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,140
但是!我不想有女朋友
But I don't want to be in a relationship.

162
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,270
这就是为什么我明确的告诉 每一个来这里的女孩
That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door

163
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
这里不是放牙刷的地方
that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush.

164
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,060
也不是放隐形眼镜盒的地方
This  is not a place to leave a contact lens case.

165
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,400
此地不宜久留
This is a place to leave.

166
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,040
来 我带你去看看
Come on, I'll give you a tour.

167
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,020
禁止照相
Uh, no flash photography, please.

168
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,310
欢迎来到卧室
Bienvenido to the bedroom.

169
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,080
看 超大的床
Dig this: king-sized bed,

170
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,100
大毛毯 一个枕头
full-sized blanket, one pillow.

171
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,730
这些东西都在对曾睡过的人说 这没你的事了　你可以走了
Everything about this bed says, "our work here is done."

172
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,820
接下来是盥洗室
Next we say "bienvenue" to the bathroom.

173
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,970
为什么只有一条毛巾?
What, only one towel?

174
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,580
为什么没有电吹风?
What, no hairdryer?

175
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,950
你知道我把东西都放哪吗? 你住的房间 想多了
You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it.

176
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,370
接下来看最优雅
And the coup de grace...

177
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,980
看见了吧
Yeah, that's right.

178
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,760
这个还没有申请专利
Patent-pending.

179
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,580
这里是通向客厅的走廊
And wilkommen to the hallway.

180
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,790
当像泰德还有马修还要 把A片藏起的时候
While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their porn...

181
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,310
马修 他没有A片
Marshall doesn't have porn.

182
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,110
真有趣
Aww, that's sweet.

183
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,420
当像泰德还有马修还要 把A片藏起的时候
While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their porn,

184
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,720
我把我的A片  展示出来
I had mine... professionally lit.

185
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,260
当那些女的看见这些的时候 只恨自己不能飞过去
Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.

186
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,530
如果这些还赶不走他们的话
And if that doesn't drive them away,

187
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,260
还有你的克隆人战士模型
there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.

188
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,470
那不是用来吓人的 个人收藏
No, that's just awesome.

189
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,790
正如你看见的 只要是女的在我这醒来
So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here,

190
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,370
我从来都不用告诉她另筑爱巢
I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else.

191
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,810
我的公寓已经告诉她了
My apartment does it for me.

192
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,530
天啊 我最爱早午饭
God, I love brunch.

193
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,080
爽啊
Oh, damn...

194
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,380
这个南瓜真是太太太好吃了
the zucchini bread is "ridonculous."

195
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,100
两个男人吃饭并不古怪　对吧?
This isn't weird, right?

196
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,500
我曾这么想过
I sort of thought it might be,

197
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,850
但现在却不这么认为
but it totally isn't.

198
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,120
顺便问下 你没有怂恿巴尼?
And B-T-dub, you totally did not oversell the eggs Benny.

199
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,100
是的? 有问题?
Right? Right?

200
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,920
我是说 为什么我们两个难兄难弟
I mean, why can't two single bros 

201
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,620
就不能想象今天一样去听摇滚
go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?

202
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,120
确实是 谢谢 这正是我想要说的
Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.

203
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,370
这就是命运
This must be destiny.

204
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,570
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

205
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,040
我有两张周五晚上的 Mamma Mia (ABBA的歌曲) 的演出票
I have two tickets for Mamma Mia Friday night.

206
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,630
你喜欢阿巴 是吗? （ABBA是一支瑞典的流行乐乐队）
You like Abba, right?

207
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,220
我在说什么? 谁不是这样?
What am I saying? Who doesn't?

208
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,020
不管怎么说 本来是要和卡洛一起去的 现在就剩你我
Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me.

209
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,550
我们两个大男人去百老汇 你认为怎么样？
We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say?

210
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,120
好!
Yeah!

211
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,960
你被冻醒了?
Hey. Did the cold wake you?

212
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,240
没有 我一直在看你睡觉
No, I've just been watching you sleep.

213
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,210
你想洗澡吗? 但是我只有一条毛巾
Oh, did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.

214
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,220
我从不买要天天洗澡这理论的帐
I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.

215
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,070
好吧
Okay.

216
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,700
你想喝咖啡吗? 但是我这里没有了 想喝的话你得出去自己买
I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...

217
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,020
我抵制咖啡
I'm boycotting coffee.

218
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,500
但你不妨喝喝那些哥伦比亚农民的血汗
You may as well drink the tears of a Colombian peasant farmer.

219
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,590
上帝啊 我喜欢这里
God, I love this place.

220
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,160
还有个好消息 我没有工作
Good thing I don't have a job

221
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,170
所以我可以整天整天的待在这里
because I could stay here all day.

222
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,690
我想我有什么东西忘在书架上了
I think I left something on the bookshelf.

223
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,380
不要 看这些
Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look.

224
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,260
我太低级趣味了
Oh, I'm disgusting.

225
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,840
你从不隐瞒自己的欲望
Wow, you're open about your sexuality

226
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,560
这也是我爱你的一个原因
and that's one of the reasons I love you.

227
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
我说我爱你了吗?
Did I just say that?

228
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,490
好吧 我向你表白吧
Oh, well, cat's out of the bag.

229
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,290
我爱你
I love you.

230
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,490
援兵　援兵　快来吧
Whoa, uh... Okay, beep, beep. Backing up, um...

231
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,970
巴尼
Hi, Barney. Oh...

232
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,080
哦 上帝啊 你结婚了? 这个是你老婆
Oh, my God. Are you married? Is this your wife?

233
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,850
什么?不
What? No.

234
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,550
对!
Yes!

235
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,200
- 真的? - 真的!
- Yes? - Yes.

236
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,020
狗娘养的!
You son of a bitch!

237
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,530
难以置信 你亵渎了我心里最神圣的东西
I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.

238
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,190
嘿 别这样好不好 亲爱的 听我解释
Come on, baby. Please, no. Oh, you don't understand.

239
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,250
我作了什么? 太糟糕了 你怎么能   ?
What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...?

240
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,980
你以后就住这吧
You're not going anywhere.

241
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,580
终于落幕了
Wow, that was close.

242
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,290
那个另类女人都不打算走了
That hippie chick wouldn't leave.

243
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,930
她都准备住着了
She was ready to squat here.

244
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,770
莫非她愿意忍受你的 弹簧座便器?
Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?

245
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,560
她对我所在公寓里 做的一切都免疫
She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment...

246
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,200
除了你
except you.

247
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,020
你甚至好过那些A片
You're  better than porn.

248
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,560
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

249
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,420
你想继续住在我这吗?
How would you like to extend your stay here?

250
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,750
你所做的只是 假装你是我妻子
All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife,

251
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,670
吓走我的那些一夜情
and scare off the occasional one-night stand.

252
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,050
我知道 我知道 你有你的道德底线还有原则
I know, I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...

253
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
好啊 我愿意
I'll do it.

254
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,590
真的?
Really?

255
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,390
巴尼 你的母亲的诸多问题让你
Barney, you've clearly got some serious mother issues

256
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,760
感情空虚的如同一只耗子
that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat.

257
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,890
但是 在我的公寓里 我要...
But, in my other apartment, I would be living

258
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,090
一只真正的耗子生活 所以我留下
with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.

259
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,860
我接受
I'll take it.

260
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,370
- Mamma Mia? - Mamma Mia?
- Mamma Mia? - Mamma Mia.

261
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,250
你知道什么 这个可是个经典歌舞剧
You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay?

262
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,240
他赢了托尼奖的所有奖项
It won all sorts of Tonys and stuff.

263
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,850
总之这听起来就象 令人激动 第三次约会
No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.

264
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,180
第三次约会 你知道这个意味着什么吗?(Robin在模仿啪啪时候床的吱吱声)
Ooh, third date. You know what that means.

265
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,560
老大们 服你了 这个不是约会
It is not a date, okay.

266
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,530
兄弟两个去看百老汇有问题?
It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.

267
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,590
你们两个在看表演之前 吃饭吗?
You bros going to get dinner beforehand?

268
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,290
说不定我们去吃点牛排
We might grab a steak, yeah.

269
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,090
在那吃?
Where at?

270
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,290
爱情咖啡馆
Cafe L'Amour.

271
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,820
布莱德说那的东西好吃! 好不好
Brad says the food is really good there, okay.

272
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,370
听起来 布莱德安排好了一切了
Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out.

273
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,790
你最好准备个A计划
You better bring your "A" game.

274
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,430
穿性感内裤
That means no granny panties.

275
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,500
好吧 你们知道吗 你们俩感到有危险
All right, you know what? You two are just threatened

276
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,230
就是因为我是个出现 在你们当中的灯泡?
because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' turf.

277
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,030
好吧 告诉你们 这是我自己的事情
Well, guess what? It's my territory now.

278
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,470
我在早午饭已经计划好了 丰盛的晚餐 还有 精彩的音乐剧
I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals.

279
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,030
没错 我和布莱德不去百老汇了
That's  right; Brad and I are taking back Broadway.

280
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,290
你打算穿什么?
What are you going to wear?

281
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,500
我是这样打算的 有领的T恤还有条纹西装
I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin...

282
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,190
你知道什么 闭嘴
Oh, you know what? Shut up.

283
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,180
能把报纸的娱乐版递给我吗?
Can you pass the Arts and Leisure?

284
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,400
能把报纸的娱乐版递给我吗?
Can you pass the Arts and Leisure?

285
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,110
我才递给你的?
I just did.

286
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,930
亲爱的 我
Honey, I'm...

287
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,800
巴尼 这发生什么?
Barney, what the hell is going on here?

288
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,070
莉莉 听我解释
Lily, I can explain...

289
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,000
你怎么 在家里!
How could you? In our own home?

290
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,700
你这杂种!
You bastard!

291
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,510
- 对不起 我不知道他 - 滚出去
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know he had... - Just get out.

292
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,990
这就是我为了这个家庭 跳了四年脱衣舞
This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years

293
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,140
让你去上医学院所得的回报
to put you through medical school?

294
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,400
我还为你隆胸
I got breast implants for you.

295
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,560
我   我还准备掉几滴眼泪呢
I... I was just about to turn on the tears.

296
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,070
你演得太精彩了
Brava.

297
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,300
简直难以置信
That was incredible.

298
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,570
而且那记耳光也是如假包换 你一点也没留情
And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.

299
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,220
是 那是我一直想做的
Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.

300
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,700
那我们都扯平了
Fair enough.

301
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,340
我不得不说
I have to say,

302
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,870
有时候在这里吃东西感觉不错
it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.

303
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,170
你知道
You know...

304
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,040
算了
nah, never mind.

305
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,120
说吧 什么?
What?

306
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,470
你是我妻子 你不用顾忌什么
You're my wife. You can tell me anything.

307
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,280
如果你真的希望 别人都上你的当的话
Well, if you really wanted to sell this ruse,

308
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,400
你应该试图把这里变得...
we should try to make this place a little more...

309
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,640
你知道 家的感觉
you know, homey.

310
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,230
就像是真的有个女人住这
Like-like a woman would actually live here.

311
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,320
你怎么打算?
What did you have in mind?

312
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:17,350
# Bones, bones, brittle little bones #

313
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,552
# It's not the milk you seek #

314
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:22,331
# It's the sun you need #

315
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:27,352
# Sugar dumpling, muffin baby #

316
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:31,803
# This world is going crazy #

317
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:33,593
# Do do do do #

318
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:35,922
# Do do do do #

319
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:39,213
# Do do do do do #

320
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,440
你回来了啊
Hey, you're home.

321
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,540
我们以为你要明早才回来
I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.

322
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,780
哈哈 这又不是约会
Ha, ha, ha, ha. It wasn't a date.

323
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,210
即使是约会 也是个奇怪的约会
Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.

324
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,370
你不用这么客气
Oh, you really don't have to do that.

325
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,070
不 这次我请 你是我的客人
No, I insist. You're my guest.

326
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,750
谢谢你 布莱德
Thanks, Brad.

327
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,240
兄弟
Bro,

328
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,760
巧克力吃到你脸上了
you got some chocolate on your chin.

329
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,370
没擦掉
Still there.

330
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,240
我来吧 傻男孩
I'll get that bad boy.

331
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,110
哇～
Whoa.

332
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,650
这还会更糟
Well, it could have been worse.

333
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,930
难说弄到你嘴里了
It  could have fallen in your lap.

334
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,520
越来越糟
It gets worse.

335
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,720
不 不用 我可以自己搞定 谢谢 布莱德
No, I-I can do it, Brad. Okay, thank you.

336
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,220
不管怎么样 这个周六...
So anyway, ah, it's this Saturday.

337
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,910
你想来嘛?
Do you want to come?

338
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,540
你想让我和你一起去参加婚礼?
You want me to go to a wedding with you?

339
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,430
还好啊 不是太糟
Okay, that's not too bad.

340
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,240
两个单身男人在婚礼上四处游荡 有点不速之客的感觉
Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like Wedding Crashers.

341
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,280
不要让布莱德接到花束就好
Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.

342
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,720
比这还要糟
It gets worse.

343
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,120
看起来好多了
It gets better.

344
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,490
这时候的佛蒙特州风景特别好
The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.

345
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,470
佛蒙特州?
Vermont?

346
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,240
是啊 婚礼在一家B&B(床和早餐)饭店举行
Yeah, the wedding's at this awesome B&B.

347
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,410
卡莱和我以前经常去那
Kara and I used to go there.

348
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,390
不管怎么说我弄到最后一间屋子
Anyway, there is one room left, and we got it.

349
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,670
是不是有点惠特曼的风格 (此人是个双性恋)
Walt Whitman Suite, bro.

350
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,620
你拒绝了 是吗?
You said no, right?

351
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,020
当然
Of course.

352
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,410
我知道
I understand.

353
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,680
是有点酷
It's cool.

354
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,210
这是自从卡莱离开之后
It's the first time I was going to see my college friends

355
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,320
我第一次去见我大学同学
since Kara left me.

356
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,970
我只是
I just...

357
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,010
太想她了
I just miss her so much.

358
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,900
我和你去吧
I'll go to Vermont with you.

359
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,560
太好了!
That's great!

360
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,770
你知道吗? 他们已经在陶吧注册了
You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn.

361
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,920
我们俩可以手把手的做个陶罐
I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat.

362
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,850
对不起 现在就不再好笑了
I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.

363
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,910
都是早午餐惹得祸!
Damn you, brunch!

364
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,350
这家伙疯了 是吗?
This guy's crazy, right?

365
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,490
我不认为他疯了
Look, I don't think he's crazy.

366
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,000
我只是认为他倍受失恋的打击
I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal.

367
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,730
不幸的是 你成为他的精神寄托了
And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.

368
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,780
在这段畸形爱恋里 你现在唯一能做的就是
And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do:

369
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,870
分手
break up.

370
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,240
你们是对的 太对了 但是我答应他
You're right. You're right. I promised Brad

371
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,730
我会陪他一起去的 就这么定了
I would go to the wedding with him, and then that is it.

372
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,250
大好人
Good man.

373
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,480
我认为我们的决定是正确的
Oh, I think we made the right decision

374
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,780
意大利的全棉床上用品
going for the custom-made Italian sheets.

375
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,390
要是我的床也能穿西装的话 那就好了
Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right.

376
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,450
不想出去走走?
Want to give it a whirl?

377
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,080
好吧 我要出去了 去酒吧转转
All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars.

378
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,560
你今晚做什么?
What are you going to do tonight?

379
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,510
我本来想看电视剧的 但是 上帝啊 你的床太舒服了
Oh, I was just going to watch Letterman but, God this bed is so comfy.

380
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,010
你要是在卧室有个电视就好了
I wish you had a TV in here.

381
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,620
说正经的  你的钱怎么来的啊
Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living?

382
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,180
无可奉告
Please.

383
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,590
我以为你要出去了
I thought you were going out.

384
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,700
恩
Eh.

385
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,700
这段独白之后
After the monologue.

386
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,040
第二天早晨 当阳光开始亲吻曼哈顿时
The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan,

387
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,140
你马修叔叔直奔布莱德的公寓去
your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment

388
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,210
为了参加在佛蒙特州举行的婚礼
to leave for the wedding in Vermont.

389
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,940
但是 当他到那的时候
But when he got there...

390
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,240
不
No.

391
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,350
不要
No...

392
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,270
不
No.

393
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,610
天啊!
No!

394
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,760
怎么会这样
No.

395
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,350
泰德
Ted.

396
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,230
布莱德为我准备了一束花
Um, Brad got me flowers.

397
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,620
等等
Hold on.

398
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,790
布莱德为他准备了一束花
Brad got him flowers.

399
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,670
不好意思 怎么这么搞笑啊
I'm sorry. It just got funny again.

400
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,120
- 嘿 - 等等 你先听我说
- Oh, hey... - No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it.

401
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,200
我是跟你关系不错 海芋百合也是我最喜欢的花
I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower.

402
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,840
我不知道你是怎么知道的 我猜你了解我
I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me,

403
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,670
这样并不酷 我简直不能相信你
but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...

404
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,810
- 甜心
- Hey, sweetie. - Hey.

405
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,730
- 马修 你好啊 - 你好 卡莱
- Hey, Marshall. - Hi, Kara.

406
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,130
这样   你们 看上去破镜重圆了?
So you guys, are like, back together now?

407
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,810
是啊 就在昨晚
Yeah. Happened last night.

408
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,650
不好意思 兄弟
Uh, I'm sorry, bro.

409
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,620
- 我应该打电话告诉你的 - 是的 你该打电话告诉我
- I should have called you. - Yeah, you should have.

410
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,960
- 我不是有意的 - 没事  布莱德
- Well, I didn't mean to hurt... - Don't, Brad.

411
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,200
不需要
Just don't.

412
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:12,491
# There was something # # in the air that night #

413
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,833
# The stars went bright #

414
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,440
他怎么了?
Oh, what was with him?

415
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,300
不知道
I don't know.

416
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,930
我想他爱上我了
I think he's in love with me.

417
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,392
# Fernando #

418
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,020
简直难以致信 我和你
I can't believe we just... you and I...

419
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,540
- 我们都作什么了? - 没什么
- what have we done? - Nothing.

420
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,000
什么都没有发生 我们只是睡着了
Nothing happened. We-we just went to sleep.

421
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,760
仅仅睡着了? 我从来都不睡在这样的床上 一个女士床
Just went to sleep? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman

422
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,970
更不可能在睡觉的时候不动
and not make a move.

423
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,600
这怎么可能  你...
How could... You.

424
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,600
你肯定非礼了我
You spooned me against my will.

425
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,940
但一个巴掌拍不响的
Hey, it takes two to cuddle.

426
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,390
我们
We...

427
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,900
我们
We...

428
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,660
我们重新布置了我的房子
We redecorated my place.

429
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,980
我们周五晚上在一起看电视
We stayed in on a Friday night to watch Letterman,

430
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,220
睡在一起 居然没有发生性关系
and then slept together and didn't have sex?

431
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,780
我的上帝啊 我们是恋爱关系
Oh, my God, we're in a relationship.

432
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,060
这就是你所谓的恋爱关系?
That's what you think a relationship is?

433
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,520
我原本以为你有免疫力
You were supposed to be the vaccine,

434
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,930
但是你把爱情病传染给了我 你必须得走了
but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.

435
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,190
巴尼
Barney.

436
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,580
我不认为是在对我生气 你是在对自己生气
I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself.

437
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,980
你放下戒备 让别人能进入你的生活
You let down your guard, and let someone into your life,

438
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,480
事实上这种感觉会很好
and-and it actually felt okay.

439
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,770
但却吓到了你
And that terrifies you.

440
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,250
你得走
Uh-huh. You gotta go.

441
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,820
你怎么能叫我扫地出门? 我在这可是花了不少精力
Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place,

442
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,060
还有我开始习惯这种生活
and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.

443
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,920
这种生活? 你什么都没有付出!
A certain standard of living? You didn't pay a single...

444
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,990
就这样在两周的婚姻生活后
And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks of marriage,

445
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,740
史蒂森夫妇 决定叫停
decided to call it quits.

446
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,910
幸运的是他们达成了个协议
Fortunately, they reached a settlement.

447
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,500
这就是你的关于你的莉莉婶婶 如何装饰她公寓的故事
And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment.

448
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,700
几天之后马修又遇见了布莱德

Laugh like I said something really funny.

451
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,230

452
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,080

458

So, I guess I'll see you around.

459
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,790
好啊 好啊
Sure. Sure.

460
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,060
即使你没觉得 你也要跟我说 他变胖了
Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat.

461
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,360
一点不假 是变胖了
Totally looks fat.
