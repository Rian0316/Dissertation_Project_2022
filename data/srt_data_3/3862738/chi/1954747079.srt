第八季  第二十四集[本季终]

10
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,270
你敢相信我们已经交往五年了吗
Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?

11
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,860
是啊
I know.

12
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,170
你觉得我该开始看电视剧《闪电侠》了吗
Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?

13
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,440
你脑子里就在想这个啊
That's what you're thinking about?

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,620
这只是其中一件
Well, one of the things.

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,440
有跟我有关的事吗
Are any of them me?

16
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,160
有啊
Yes.

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,440
我在想  "不知道该不该开始看《闪电侠》电视剧
I thought, "I can't decide if I should watch The Flash TV show.

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,100
对了  我可以问问艾米"
I know, I'll ask Amy."

19
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,900
言归正传
Anyway...

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,290
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,300
也是  气氛都被你毁了
You're right, you did kind of kill the mood.

22
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,310
才不是我呢
I didn't kill anything.

23
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,480
是你  在那边说你的白痴电视剧
You did, talking about your stupid TV show.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,900
你说什么
Excuse me.

25
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,820
跳坑看一部可能播好几年的电视剧
Starting to watch a television show that might run for years

26
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,880
不是随便就能决定的好吗
isn't a decision to take lightly.

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,010
我在纠结要不要许下这一重大承诺呢
I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,570
真的吗
Really?

29
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,370
你纠结的承诺问题就是这种事吗
That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with?

30
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,410
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

31
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,890
你能理解这有多讽刺吗
do you understand the irony

32
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,520
你能对一个拥有超高速的男人这么痴迷
of your fixation on a man with super speed,

33
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,020
而我在跟了你五年后却只能得到
while after five years all I can get out of you

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,160
在沙发上的一场你心不在焉的亲热
is a distracted make-out session on a couch?

35
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,220
讽刺不是我的强项
Irony's not really my strong suit.

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,550
不过我对挖苦的理解有不小进步
But I have been getting better with sarcasm,

37
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,530
你可以试试看啊
if you want to give that a try.

38
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,620
行啊  我"当然愿意"啦
Oh, sure, I'd love to.

39
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,050
你准备好了就出招吧
Whenever you're ready.

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,480
我不想催你们
I don't want to rush you,

41
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,440
但我今晚要提早关门
but I'm closing a little early tonight.

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,330
有约会吗
Ooh. Hot date?

43
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,600
没  我听到伯纳黛特跟霍华德说
Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,730
要给他做肉卷
she was making him a meat loaf,

45
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,400
我不想麻烦人家"不邀请我"两次
and you don't have to not ask me twice.

46
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,790
如果我在上面加个灯泡
If I stick a lightbulb on this, 

47
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,530
是不是超适合当我卧室的台灯
wouldn't it make a great lamp for my bedroom?

48
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,740
你是在开玩笑的  对吧
You're kidding, right?

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,160
这吓到你了吗
Oh. Is this freaking you out?

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,050
没  我只是比较喜欢那些
I guess I'm just more of a Pottery Barn,

51
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,660
连锁家具用品店的产品而已
Crate and Barrel kind of guy.

52
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,980
想疯狂时  我会选进口手工家具店
Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.

53
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,110
好吧  那算了
All right. Never mind.

54
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,160
别别别  你想买就买吧
No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it.

55
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,660
来  员外给你买
In fact, I'll buy it for you.

56
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,110
卖
Sold!

57
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,080
拉杰  你不需要这样
Raj, you don't have to do that.

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,350
晚了  一经售出  概不退还
Too late! No returns!

59
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,440
刚才真是生死一瞬间啊
That was really intense.

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,210
现在我们知道了  下次去农贸市场
Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market,

61
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,160
应该是先去亲近动物区  再去买蔬菜
the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.

62
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,050
太好了  你回来了  我有事要你帮忙
Oh, good. You're here. I need your assistance.

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,310
我能先给被羊的地方贴上创口贴吗
Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?

64
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,750
怎么回事
What happened?

65
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,330
你兄弟被家畜幼崽给打劫啦
Your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.

66
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,620
我也试过
Been there.

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,740
你有什么事需要帮忙呀
So what do you need help with?

68
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,720
艾米在生我气  我搞不懂是为什么
Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.

69
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,960
好吧  她生气前你是不是在说话
Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,560
-是啊  -这就是原因啦
- Yes. - That's probably it.

71
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,920
你跟她说什么了
What'd you say to her?

72
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,780
我就问她我该不该开始看
Well, I just asked her if I should start watching

73
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,600
新电视剧《闪电侠》
the new Flash TV series.

74
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
这把她惹生气了吗
And that made her angry?

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,420
很莫名其妙  对吧
Baffling, right? 

76
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,470
本来我们还像小流氓们一样
We were necking like a couple of hooligans 

77
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,790
在学校里亲亲我我
under the school bleachers.

78
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,270
然后我停下来问了她这问题
I stopped so I could ask the question.

79
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,270
接下来  亲亲脸没了  凶凶脸来了
Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.

80
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,730
谢尔顿  你在亲女生的时候
Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl,

81
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,880
她会希望你的注意力在她身上
she expects the attention to be on her.

82
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,440
有啊  我有问她
It was. I asked her

83
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,320
"她"觉得我该不该看《闪电侠》
if she thought I should watch The Flash.

84
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,960
要求换人  莱纳德你上
Yeah. I'm tapping out. Leonard?

85
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,960
我猜你主要的疑虑是对于看一整季新剧
I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,180
需要做出的时间承诺
of watching an entire season of a new show.

87
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,780
不  不只是一季
Oh, no, not just a season.

88
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,840
要看  就得看到底
If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run,

89
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,500
哪怕剧质量越来越差
even if the quality declines.

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,030
我懂  《超人前传》把你伤得太深了
I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.

91
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,800
没错
Exactly.

92
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,230
我等了整整十年
You know, I waited ten years

93
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,440
才看到一个大家都知道会飞的人  飞起来
to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.

94
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,310
等等  你俩是哪里有病啊
Wait, what is wrong with you two?

95
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,520
重点是他在约会之夜聊电视剧
He was talking about television during their date night.

96
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,610
可不只是约会之夜  是五周年纪念日哦
Oh, not just date night-- our fifth anniversary.

97
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,690
你看  这句话就比你在想
Okay, see, that's even dumber than you wondering

98
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,460
被羊咬会不会得到羊的力量还要蠢
if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.

99
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,580
如果成真了  拜托别让我等了十年
If that happens, don't make me wait ten years

100
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,240
才让我看到你吃掉锡罐
to watch you eat a tin can.

101
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,200
你们有发现艾米丽有一点黑暗扭曲吗
You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?

102
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,960
你是指因为她有怪怪的刺青吗
You mean 'cause she has weird tattoos?

103
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,990
不  是因为她想跟我在墓地里做爱
No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.

104
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,590
再说一次
One more time?

105
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,010
她本来今晚要跟我
She and I were supposed to watch

106
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,200
去看新《复仇者联盟》电影  但票卖完了
the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out.

107
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,720
我就说"那我们应该干嘛"
So I said, "What else do you want to do?"

108
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,290
她说"我们就去墓场
She said, "Let's go to a cemetery

109
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,060
在别人的坟上打一炮吧
and do it on somebody's grave."

110
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,060
是陌生人还是认识的人的坟头上啊
Like, a random person or somebody she knew?

111
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,570
这有差别吗
What difference does it make?

112
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,150
如果是在她爸的坟上搞  而他们以前关系不好
Well, if it's her father's grave and they didn't get along,

113
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,490
那你就知道她一直心怀怨恨
then you know she holds a grudge.

114
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,310
唯一的问题是每个人都有自己的性怪癖
The only issue is that everybody has their own thing.

115
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,120
但只要两个成年人都同意这么做
And as long as it's two consenting adults,

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,840
我不觉得有什么危害呀
I guess I don't see the harm in it.

117
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,150
万一只是一个成年人同意
Well, what if it's one consenting adult

118
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,810
而另一个成年人是假装同意
and one adult who pretends to consent

119
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,520
因为他太害怕当单身狗了  这怎么破
because he's afraid of being alone?

120
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,080
那我建议最好带上一张毯子
Well, then I guess bring a blanket.

121
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,360
夜里的草地很潮湿
The grass gets damp at night.

122
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,550
我不知道了  
I don't know, guys.

123
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,870
或许这段恋情并不适合我
Maybe this relationship isn't for me.

124
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,550
或许我该跟她分手
Maybe I should break up with her.

125
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,940
是啊  你要跟一个愿意跟你上床的女人分手
Right. You're gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you.

126
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,690
你听听这家伙说啥蠢话
Can you believe this guy?

127
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,360
如果拉杰想跟女人分手  我相信他必能做到
I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,480
你怎么做到一脸正经地鬼扯呢
How are you saying that with a straight face?

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,440
我也不知道
I don't know.

130
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,190
你们俩真过分
You guys are being jerks.

131
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,400
伙计  除了珍妮·克莱格减肥法
Buddy, other than Jenny Craig,

132
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,400
{\an8}一个控制摄入热量和膳食份量的三阶段减肥计划

133
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,930
你这辈子从未甩过一个女人
you've never broken up with a girl in your life.

134
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,930
你还好意思说我
You're one to talk.

135
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,410
你不也一直在抱怨斯尔图特
You've been complaining about Stuart

136
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,490
在你家住了一年死活不走吗
living here for the past year.

137
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,860
我看你也没有赶他走的意思啊
I don't see you showing him the door.

138
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,670
那不一样
That's not the same thing.

139
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,040
艾米丽是一个人
Emily's a person.

140
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,070
斯尔图特更像一只害虫
Stuart's more like an infestation,

141
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,160
就是欠杀虫剂喷的那种
something you spray for.

142
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,750
胡扯  你们俩跟我一样
Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of 

143
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,220
都害怕伤害到别人的感受
hurting someone's feelings as I am.

144
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,100
才不是呢  我们俩刚可是当面笑话你
That's not true. We were just laughing right in your face.

145
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,610
谢谢你下厨做饭
Thanks for cooking.

146
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,520
乐意之至
My pleasure.

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
-胡萝卜真好吃  -是啊
- That carrot was delicious. - Yeah.

148
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,340
真希望我当时能勇猛点  守护好其余胡萝卜
I wish I'd fought harder for the rest of 'em.

149
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,530
艾米还没理你吗
Still haven't heard from her?

150
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,010
没呢  我不明白
No, and I'm confused.

151
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,100
这都将近24小时了
It's been nearly 24 hours.

152
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,440
她现在应该意识到自己错了呀
Amy should have figured out she's wrong by now.

153
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,220
她觉得你俩发展太慢
Hey, I don't think she's wrong

154
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,900
这件事情我不觉得她有错
about you going too slow in the relationship.

155
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,270
太慢吗
Too slow?

156
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,580
是啊  你们俩都约会好几年了
Yeah, you've been going out for years. 

157
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,070
至今还没上过床呢
You haven't even slept together.

158
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,300
没错  那叫前戏懂不懂
That's right. It's called foreplay.

159
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,500
而且我可以证明
And I could make the case

160
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,290
你们俩的发展现在也停滞不前
that you two aren't moving forward in your relationship.

161
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,010
请看
Uh, hello.

162
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,610
看什么
Hello.

163
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,820
谢尔顿  我们可是要结婚了啊
No. Sheldon, we're getting married.

164
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,680
可你们俩订婚都一年多了
But you've been engaged for over a year now,

165
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,350
至今仍未定下婚期
and you don't even have a wedding date.

166
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,010
会定的  我们并不着急
Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.

167
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,690
好吧
Okay.

168
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,760
我们会定下婚期
We're gonna set a date.

169
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,550
好吧  随你怎么说
Okay. If you say so.

170
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,140
是啊  现在我们感情很稳定
Yeah, it's just, things are good right now.

171
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,780
非常稳定
Really good.

172
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,830
我忙于我的工作
I'm focusing on my job.

173
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,020
我们也一直在忙我们的论文
And we've been busy with our paper.

174
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,760
忙死了
So busy.

175
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,920
是啊  我们想定就会定
Yeah, we'll pick a date when we pick a date.

176
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,300
是啊
Yeah.

177
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,410
好吧
Okay.

178
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,930
我完全明白为什么艾米会生气
You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.

179
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,700
就是  把嘴闭上  谢尔顿
Yeah, shut up, Sheldon!

180
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,280
是你把我的酸奶吃了吗
Did you eat all my yogurt?

181
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,930
你是说有助于女性做那件事的那玩意吗
You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing

182
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,090
那件你们明明做了
that ladies pretend they don't do

183
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,610
却要假装没做的"屎"
even though they do?

184
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,610
你知道
You know...

185
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,900
我说的是哪个酸奶
which yogurt I mean.

186
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,040
我没有碰过  肯定是斯尔图特吃的
I didn't touch it. Must have been Stuart.

187
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,790
或许拉杰说得对
Maybe Raj is right.

188
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,690
或许是时候我们让他搬走了
Maybe it's time we tell him he needs to move out.

189
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,410
我们几个月前就该这么做了
We should have done it months ago.

190
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,650
我知道  但碍于他的店重新开张
I know, but his store was reopening,

191
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,280
然后又各种过节  再然后他又生病了
and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.

192
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,270
是啊
Yeah, right.

193
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,670
生病  他根本没有黄疸
Sick. He didn't have jaundice.

194
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,480
他脸本来就蜡黄蜡黄的
He just looks like that.

195
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,960
行了  就今晚说吧
All right. Tonight's the night.

196
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,720
同意
Agreed.

197
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,360
等他一回家  我就单刀直入
When he gets home, I'm dropping the hammer.

198
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
我喜欢你当家做主的样子
Ooh, I like when you take charge.

199
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,040
我不是要当家做主  你是刀我负责拔刀而已
Oh, I'm not taking charge-- you're the hammer.

200
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,240
话说...
So...

201
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,290
我们为什么没定下婚期
why haven't we picked a date?

202
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,180
你知道原因
You know why.

203
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,690
我当然知道啦
Well, of course I know why.

204
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,930
但只是好玩问问  为什么呀
But just for fun... why?

205
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,450
不着急啊  忙于工作啊
Not in a rush, busy with work...

206
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,700
现在感情很稳定啊
Things are good right now.

207
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,420
非常稳定
Really good.

208
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,950
你还是想跟我结婚的对吧
You still want to get married, right?

209
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,070
天啊  当然啦  你干嘛问这种蠢问题
Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?

210
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,190
不知道  或许因为我们没定婚期
I don't know. Because we don't have a date?

211
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,630
那你想定婚期你定啊
Well, you want a date, pick a date.

212
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,100
不光光是婚期
It's not just the date.

213
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,690
我们从来没谈过婚礼的事
We haven't talked about anything.

214
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,830
婚礼你想要大型还是小型  室内还是户外
Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor...

215
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,530
户外婚礼  不是吧
Outdoor? Oh. 

216
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,460
我现在就可以明确说我不去了
I can RSVP no right now.

217
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,280
行  那就室内  你喜欢大型还是小型
Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?

218
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,230
你爸会掏钱吗
Is your dad paying for it?

219
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,890
深表怀疑
I doubt it.

220
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,870
好吧  那各邀请两位好友
Okay, two friends each.

221
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,410
行  我想在教堂办婚礼
All right, well, I want it in a church.

222
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,810
行  宾客都要穿半正式礼服
Fine. I want black-tie.

223
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,370
行  我要在婚礼上放蝴蝶
Fine. I want to release butterflies.

224
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,470
你不是吧  放飞行虫子吗
Seriously? Airborne worms?

225
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,970
好了  这下都定了
Okay. Well, then it's settled:

226
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,590
小型室内教堂婚礼  半正式礼服  不放蝴蝶
small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.

227
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,490
-听起来完美  -太好了
- Sounds perfect. - Great.

228
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,140
婚期还没定呢
You still didn't pick a date.

229
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,870
-少管闲事  -把嘴闭上
- Stay out of it! - Shut up!

230
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,090
真是个迷人的夜晚
It's a beautiful night.

231
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,380
对啊  月色朦胧
Oh, yes, we've got the moon

232
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,430
树影婆娑  还有
and the trees and...

233
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,430
伊丽莎白·麦可诺提
Elizabeth McNulty,

234
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,980
在我这个岁数就英年早逝的可怜人儿
who apparently died when she was the same age I am.

235
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,830
会让你觉得活着真好  对吧
Makes you feel alive, doesn't it?

236
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,100
在灯光明亮的餐馆享用美食也有同等效果
So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant,

237
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,910
但我们还是选了这里
but here we are.

238
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,070
你不是在害怕吧
You aren't scared, are you?

239
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,090
怕鬼吗  才没有
Of ghosts, no.

240
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,050
怕你吗  有一点
Of you, little bit.

241
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,660
很抱歉惹你们不高兴了
I'm sorry I've upset you.

242
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,560
我不应该问那么多问题
I shouldn't have asked so many questions.

243
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,730
不  没关系
No, it's okay.

244
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,990
也许你让我们着手讨论这件事是正确的
Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff.

245
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,910
哎哟哟  看看
Well, look at that--

246
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,300
我就算引发问题  也可以让世界变得更美好
even when I'm causing problems, I make the world a better place.

247
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,580
接下来让我们讨论一下你那唠叨的毛病
Hey, next, why don't we tackle your penchant for whining

248
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,600
还有佩妮对杯中物的痴迷吧
and Penny's love of the ol' glug-glug?

249
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,410
谢尔顿  不要再挑事了
Uh, Sheldon, I think we're good for now.

250
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,970
好吧  很好
Ah, well... very well.

251
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,370
这代表你们终于要定下婚期了吗
So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date?

252
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,300
又回到原点了
Here we go again.

253
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,920
为什么大家这么着急要我们定婚期呢
Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date?

254
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,850
我们忠于彼此  幸福快乐
We're committed to each other. We're happy.

255
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,200
一场婚礼并不会改变什么
A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.

256
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,460
所以你俩打算不结婚  对吗
So you're never getting married?

257
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,600
是因为他的唠叨  对吧
It's his whining, isn't it?

258
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,630
谢尔顿  我不是个唠叨鬼
Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.

259
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,670
他居然完全察觉不到  真是好笑
It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.

260
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,330
佩妮的意思是我们深爱彼此
Look, all she's saying is we are in love

261
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,760
所以无所谓是明天结婚
so it doesn't matter if we get married tomorrow 

262
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,070
明年结婚  还是50年后结婚
or a year from now or 50 years from now.

263
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,370
50年后  那时我们都又老又丑了
Ew, 50? We'll be old and gross.

264
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,830
没错  但是我们会一起变老变丑
Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.

265
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,380
我阿姨和叔叔结婚63年了
My aunt and uncle were married 63 years.

266
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,100
到最后  他们像奶酪一样慢慢融化
Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.

267
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,430
我今晚就有空
Um... I'm free tonight.

268
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,600
你是说你想结婚吗
Are you saying you want to get married?

269
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,830
拉斯维加斯又不是太远
Vegas isn't that far away.

270
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,220
我同意  我们结婚吧
I'm in. Let's do it.

271
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,680
经过了这么多年的风风雨雨
After all these years.

272
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,570
我衷心为你们俩高兴
I'm really happy for the two of you.

273
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,410
-谢谢  -谢谢你
- Oh, thank you. - Thanks.

274
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,730
现在从我的专座上滚开
Now get out of my spot.

275
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,080
妮妮  斯图尔特刚停好车
Bernie, Stuart just pulled up.

276
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,390
你要记住
So remember,

277
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,380
关键是要态度强硬
the key is to be firm.

278
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,430
绝对不能示弱
Show no weakness.

279
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,000
没错
Right.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,380
祝你好运
Good luck.

281
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,980
霍华德·约珥·沃罗维兹  给我死回来
Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.

282
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,880
我就不该告诉她我的中间名
Never should have told you my middle name.

283
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,860
{\an8}一般表示问题严重或很正式的场合时才用到中间名

284
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,860
两位好啊
Hey, guys.

285
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,220
回来啦  你有空吗
Hey, you got a minute?

286
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,520
当然  先等我把这些东西放进冰箱
Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge.

287
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,220
不好意思我吃光了你的酸奶  所以我多买了点
I felt bad for finishing your yogurt, so I bought more.

288
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,530
霍华德  你最爱的水果正当季呢
And, Howard, your favorite fruit is in season.

289
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,620
脆脆莓果[麦片]
Crunch Berries.

290
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,750
千万不要动摇
Don't let that sway you.

291
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,790
好难哦
It's hard not to. 

292
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,970
那个比真的莓果好吃多了
They taste so much better than real berries.

293
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,070
怎么了
What's up?

294
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,350
我们...需要谈一谈
So... we need to talk.

295
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,540
你没事吧
You okay?

296
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,850
我们需要谈一谈
I think we should talk.

297
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,510
出什么事了吗
Is everything okay?

298
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,170
你在这里住了一段时间了
Well... you've been living here a while now.

299
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,060
我知道  我的工作虽然是卖漫画
I know. I may sell comic books at work,

300
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,580
但真正的超级英雄
but the real superheroes

301
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,950
就正坐在我面前呢
are sitting right in front of me.

302
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,100
是啊
Yeah...

303
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,590
他的中间名是大卫  凶他
His middle name is David. Go.

304
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,500
我真的非常在乎你
Look, I care about you a lot,

305
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,060
但我们俩之间的差距太大了
but we are very different people.

306
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,710
你是想和我分手吗
Are you breaking up with me?

307
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,880
不  我只是想说
No, no, I'm just pointing out that

308
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,670
你是心黑腹黑  我是人黑脸黑
you're dark on the inside and I'm dark on the outside.

309
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,100
总之  我想说的是...
So, anyway, what I'm trying to say is...

310
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,320
你要接电话吗
You need to take that?

311
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,470
是我爸  估计是打来
It's just my dad, probably calling

312
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,980
来祝我生日快乐的吧
to wish me a happy birthday.

313
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,220
我等会再回他电话
I'll call him back.

314
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,220
你刚想说什么
You were saying?

315
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,040
拉杰  你就实话实话吧
Look, Raj, be honest with me.

316
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,670
如果你想分手  就直截了当说出来
If you want to end things, just do it.

317
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,710
不要指望我替你开口
Don't expect me to do it for you.

318
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,350
谁要分手  我只是想说我爱你
End things? I'm trying to tell you that I love you.

319
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:34,060
* 祝你生日快乐 *
* Happy birthday to you. *

320
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,130
哇  拉斯维加斯有家快餐店
Wow, there's a Denny's in Vegas

321
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,750
人们可以在那里结婚
you can actually get married in.

322
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,760
听上去怎么这么不浪漫啊
Doesn't sound very romantic.

323
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,160
是  不过可以吃到心形煎饼啊
Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.

324
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,440
肯定能找一个像样的教堂
I'm sure we'll find a decent chapel.

325
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,550
好的
Yeah.

326
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,650
-这太疯狂了  -我知道
- This is crazy! - I know!

327
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,290
他们不会生气吧
You think people are gonna be mad?

328
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,060
或许会吧  但主角是我们  不是他们
Maybe. But this isn't about them; it's about us.

329
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,950
对  我们才是主角
It is. It is about us.

330
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,360
你知道最棒的是什么吗
And you know what the best part is?

331
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,260
我们循序渐进
We took our time.

332
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,120
先是相遇  当了几年的朋友
I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years,

333
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,630
然后在一起  再然后分开
then we got together, and then we got untogether,

334
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,210
一起面对解决了所有问题
then we worked out all our problems,

335
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,550
现在彼此了解得一清二楚
and now we know everything about each other,

336
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,420
我们可以大步向前
we can just go forward

337
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,460
绝无意外  绝不后悔
with no surprises and no regrets.

338
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,940
对  绝无意外
Right. No surprises.

339
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,270
还有绝不后悔
And no regrets.

340
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,820
有...有那么一件事
Uh, well, there-there's one thing

341
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,970
我得跟你说一下
I feel I should tell you.

342
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,240
什么事
What?

343
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,550
这样我们可以没有秘密
You know, so we can go into this

344
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,740
走进新生活
with no secrets between us.

345
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,370
快说
What?

346
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,870
还记得几年前
Remember, uh, a couple years back

347
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,680
我坐船去北海做研究吗
when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?

348
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,850
记得
Yeah.

349
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,670
好吧  在船上我们经常喝酒
Okay, well, there-there was a lot of drinking

350
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,140
做好多疯狂的事...
and craziness going on...

351
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,930
对  你说过了
No, you told me.

352
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,680
好的
Okay, um...

353
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,340
有这么一个姑娘
Well, there was this girl.

354
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,700
你干什么了
What did you do?

355
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,060
什么也没干 
Nothing...

356
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,490
真的
really.

357
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,330
就是接吻了
It was just kissing.

358
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,220
然后干了什么
And then what?

359
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,800
什么也没干
And then nothing.

360
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,740
我果断制止了
I stopped it.

361
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,000
可这事让我很困扰
But it still bothers me, and...

362
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,170
我想跟你坦白
I wanted you to know.

363
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,220
好吧
All right.

364
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,910
那段时间你有没有干过类似的事...
Did you ever do anything like this since we've been...?

365
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,740
从来没有
Nope, never.

366
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,950
那太不巧了
Oh, that's too bad.

367
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,910
我能问你个问题吗
You know, can I ask you a question?

368
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,620
为什么现在告诉我
Why are you telling me this now?

369
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,720
正如之前所说  我们要结婚了
Well, like I said, we're about to get married,

370
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,410
我想做到坦诚相待
and I-I want a clean slate.

371
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,610
不藏秘密
No secrets.

372
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,160
真的吗  可我怎么觉得是
Really? Be-Because to me,

373
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,280
我们要结婚了
it seems like we're about to get married

374
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,970
而你想搞破坏呢
and you're trying to sabotage it.

375
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,790
那你比较希望我不告诉你吗
W-Would you rather I didn't tell you?

376
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,600
不是  我不希望我们之间藏秘密
No, I don't want there to be secrets between us.

377
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,790
这样我就不懂了
See, now I'm confused.

378
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,300
那我该怎么办
I mean, what-what am I supposed to do?

379
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,960
让你的嘴别碰其他女人
Uh, keep your mouth off other women.

380
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,480
我能做到
I can do that.

381
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,900
从今开始
Uh, uh, f-from now on,

382
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,690
这张嘴  除了你与食物啥都不碰
this mouth-- you and food, that's it.

383
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,520
行吧
Okay.

384
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,380
真的吗
Yeah?

385
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,640
发生这种事我肯定不高兴
Look, I'm not happy this happened,

386
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,090
但我觉得我可以放下
but I think I can get past it.

387
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,890
毕竟那时候我们也没订婚
I mean, we weren't engaged at the time,

388
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,770
而且只是接吻而已
and it was just kissing.

389
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,220
对啊
Right.

390
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,900
接吻也不爽
Just kissing.

391
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,740
感觉一点都不好
It wasn't even very good.

392
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,760
她满嘴烟味  我一直晕船呕吐...
She was a smoker. I'd just been seasick...

393
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,220
够了  别说了
Okay, that's enough. Stop talking.

394
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,200
那...
So...

395
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,350
我们还是会结婚的吧
we're still getting married?

396
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,770
对
Yes.

397
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,080
因为我们彼此相爱
Because we love each other.

398
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,440
对
Yes.

399
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,250
这是我们这辈子最开心的一天
And it's the happiest day of our lives.

400
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,370
别得寸进尺
Don't push it.

401
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,050
你好
Hello.

402
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,080
你好
Hello.

403
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,690
听着  我一直在思考情侣关系
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about relationships

404
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,370
以及中间的种种复杂  我想...
and how difficult they can be, and I think...

405
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,280
我也想了很多  谢尔顿
I've been thinking about them, too, Sheldon.

406
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,500
当你女友对我来说是一项挑战
Being your girlfriend is so challenging.

407
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,130
无论在情绪上
Emotionally,

408
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,490
还是肉体上
physically.

409
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,020
这几年我一直保持着极度的耐心
I've been incredibly patient for years.

410
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,710
强烈反对
Strongly disagree.

411
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,590
但请继续
Go on.

412
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,640
好的
Okay, well...

413
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,100
这话很难说出口  因为我爱你
this isn't easy to say, because I love you,

414
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,540
可是...
but...

415
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,740
我需要些时间缓一缓  后退一步
I need some time to take a step back

416
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,080
重新评估下我们的状况
and reevaluate our situation.

417
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,860
希望你能理解
I hope you understand.

418
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,360
好的
Okay.

419
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,790
再见  谢尔顿
Bye, Sheldon.

420
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,820
咕噜[魔戒角色]
Well, Gollum...

421
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,960
你是戒指专家
...you're an expert on rings.

422
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,550
你说我该拿这枚戒指怎么办呢
What do I do with this one?
