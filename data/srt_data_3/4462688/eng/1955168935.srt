00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:26,444
My brother was gonna take care of me.

354
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,280
And in the dead of night,

355
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:31,082
he went through my Mesa Verde files.

356
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:32,993
Uh, you know what? We don't
have to listen to this.

357
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:39,157
She does! You do... for your own good.

358
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:42,861
Now, in these files are 13 documents

359
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:46,664
containing the address of Mesa
Verde's proposed branch...

360
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,834
1261 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona.

361
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,872
Jimmy pulled each and every
one, then he left me here,

362
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:57,776
sweating and delirious, while
he went off to doctor them.

363
00:20:57,811 --> 00:21:00,278
You'd need a photocopier for that.

364
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:03,314
Where'd you go... some
all-night copy shop?

365
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,616
[Chuckles]

366
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:07,052
With a little
careful cutting and pasting,

367
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:08,653
he created duplicates...

368
00:21:08,688 --> 00:21:10,822
virtually identical to my originals,

369
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:12,490
but with one key change...

370
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,327
1261 Rosella Drive ‭became
1216 Rosella Drive.

371
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:18,029
This is sounding like a lot of work.

372
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:19,898
No one ever accused you of being lazy...

373
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,300
every other sin in the
book, but not that one.

374
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:23,668
And if you're wondering

375
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:25,804
if Jimmy's up to a
little casual forgery,

376
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,040
you should know in high
school, he had a thrivininbusiness

377
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:31,843
making fake I.D.s ‭so
his buddies could buy beer.

378

back to high school, huh?

[Chuckling] Hey, you and Mozart, huh?

380
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:37,982

[Inhales deeply]

382
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:42,353
He came back here and put his
new versions in my files.

383
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:44,756
And then, the next day,

384
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,926
my caring brother took his leave.

385
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:50,995
He knew that I would
use his modified documents

386
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:54,532
to write Mesa Verde's
submission to the state regulator.

387
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:57,335
And so I did, over and over...

388
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,438
I typed "1216" instead of "1261."

389
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:04,342
I remember
thinking, "1216 Rosella Drive...

390
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:06,678
that's just one year after 1215,

391
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:09,280
the year the Magna Carta was signed."

392
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:12,250
Jesus, Chuck, you are unbelievable.

393
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:15,386
So, you're saying, if we look in here,

394
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:17,522
all the addresses will be wrong?

395
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:20,892
Well, of course you weren't
gonna leave evidence behind.

396
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:24,262
I'm guessing yesterday
morning, you waited until I left,

397
00:22:24,297 --> 00:22:26,698
then used your key to let yourself in

398
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,433
and return the originals.

399
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:30,902
No crime is complete
without the cover-up.

400
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:32,303
Oh, come on.

401
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:35,707
I did all this...
what... for some business?

402
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:37,709
[Sighs]

403
00:22:37,744 --> 00:22:40,979

Oh, I'm sure you didn't
know anything about it.

406
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:49,754
I believe he went off on his own

407
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:52,590
and did this as some kind
of twisted romantic gesture.

408
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:54,592
Chuck, ‭I think you need to lie down

And now that you
know, you have no choice.

411
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:04,302
This is about a client... a
client who has been defrauded.

As a sworn officer of the court,

413

Jimmy could be
charged with forgery, fraud,

breaking and entering.

My evidence?

436
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:07,498
My evidence is knowing my
brother for his entire life.

is another explanation...

How's that?

708
00:36:36,478 --> 00:36:37,944
We got lucky.

Oh, my God!"

712
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:45,986
He cut the driver
loose. The driver called us.

Hector shot him in the face.

717
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:04,804
We buried the guy out in the desert.

718
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,207

the history of television.

smallest crack in your defense.

Going against him, [Sighs] you'd
really want to make sure

dotted and your t's crossed.

Tonight is a funny night.

775
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:12,212
For some reason tonight,

776
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:16,683
I feel like I've got all the answers.

777
00:42:16,718 --> 00:42:20,253
I'm feeling kind of like, uh...

778
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,754
like Carnac.

779
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,257
Do you remember when Johnny
Carson used to do Carnac?

780
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,393
You know, he'd give the
answers before the questions.

781
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:29,963
You know, [Sighs] Ed would
give him the envelope, yeah?

782
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:32,131
And Johnny would hold
it up to his forehead,

783
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:37,871
and, um, he'd give the
answer, like, "Leave It to Beaver."

784
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:39,405
Then Johnny'd tear open the envelope.

786
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,308

raccoon say in his will?"

All right, well, let's cut to the chase.

792
00:42:52,621 --> 00:42:54,988
Um, that guy ‭who just
walked out of here...

793
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:56,589
his name is Ernie.

794
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,258
I'm guessing he showed you my picture

795
00:42:58,293 --> 00:43:00,159
and asked if ‭I was
in here the other night.

796
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:02,996
Now he's going to bring his
boss, who's my brother,

797
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:05,465
and he's gonna ask
you the same question...

798
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,233
"Did you see that guy the other night?"

799
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:10,603
Well, the answer is no.

I... Sometimes, I go number
two and I don't flush, but...

this is just a thing between brothers.

807

808
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,660
Right?

809
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:35,828
I mean, ‭that's a
long and boring story.

jammed up with the cops?

sound like that, but... no.

It, uh, tapes for 12 hours and
then records over itself.
