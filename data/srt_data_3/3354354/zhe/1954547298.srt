37 minutes,

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,260
从家里出发  到坐上地铁
we got from the apartment to the subway,

31
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,210
最后到达学校  又刷新记录了
to the pastery school in record time.

32
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,760
虽然我来不及穿胸罩
I mean, I'm not wearing a bra,

33
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,730
而且丁字裤好像也前后穿反了
and my thong might be on backwards.

34
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,130
丁字裤怎么会穿反呢
There is no wrong way to wear a thong,

35
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,820
只要不舒服就对了
as long as it's uncomfortable.

36
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,360
而且你穿胸罩也只是摆设而已
And with you, the bra is just for decoration.

37
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,200
而我是必须得穿
I have to wear one because you get a ticket

38
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,840
"孩子"不放安全座椅上  是要吃罚单的
for not put the kids in a car seat.

39
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,570
教室见  我得先跟我老婆道别
See you in class guys, I gotta say good bye to my wife.

40
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,570
你真以为我要跟你吻别吗
You think I was gonna kiss you?

41
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,470
对啊
Yes.

42
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,850
我是你老婆  你是我那位
I'm the wife, you are the husband

43
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,310
某天被我发现你有异装癖
who I caught wearing my cloth one day,

44
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,190
但我却没戳穿的老公
but I don't say anything about it.

45
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,630
早安啊  二位
Morning, guys.

46
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,910
早安  碧碧
Oh, hi, Bebe.

47
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,640
见到我很惊讶吧
Surprised to see me, right?

48
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,730
大家总以为我会在夜半时分自杀
Everyone always thinks I'm not gonna make it through the night,

49
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,400
但我还活着  连我自己都惊讶  
but here I am, even surprised myself.

50
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,450
跟一个随时会崩溃的人
What's it like working in an office

51
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,340
在同一间办公室工作是什么感觉呢
with someone who's about to snap like a breadstick?

52
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,760
绝对没想象中这么有趣
Not as much fun as you'd think.

53
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,750
但碧碧人很好  而且在这工作
But Bebe's sweet, and working here

54
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,220
主要是为了替你挣学费
is putting you through pastry school.

55
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,360
-好啦  再见  -再见
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

56
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,480
-我要离婚  -早去申请了
- I want a divorce. - I already filed.

57
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,500
老婆  我要五块钱
Hey, wife, I need $5

58
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,400
赔昨天弄坏的工具
to pay for a spatula I broke yesterday.

59
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,630
我昨天突然戈登・拉姆齐上身了
I was having a Gordon Ramsay moment.

60
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,670
{\an8}戈登・拉姆齐  英国知名厨师与电视名人
脾气火爆  时常骂人

61
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,540
有机会我不介意跟他睡哦
I'd have sex with him, by the way.

62
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,330
为啥  他肯定也是会吼你
Why? He'd just be yelling at you

63
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,470
然后说你"做"错了
and telling you you're doing it wrong.

64
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,250
做爱不都这样吗
Yeah, sex.

65
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,950
拿吧  钱在我包里
Take it. It's in my purse.

66
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,070
碧碧  你有偷偷不吃的药吗
Yo, Bebe, you got any extra pills you're not taking?

67
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,290
没有  我全都有吃
No, I'm taking them all.

68
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,480
老天爷  别啊
Oh, my God, no.

69
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,870
干嘛  我也就想要个一颗  两颗
What? I just wanted one. Or two.

70
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,860
就想减减压
Just to take the edge off.

71
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,870
三点我有一场生奶油考试
I have a whipped cream final at 3:00.

72
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,110
是报纸里的讣告
No. In the obituaries.

73
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,770
我认识这个人
I know this person.

74
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,800
"安东尼娅・佛罗伦蒂诺  享年八十
"Antonia Florentino, 80,

75
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,720
在睡梦中安详过世"
Died peacefully in her sleep."

76
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,560
明显是自杀嘛  对吧
That's a suicide, right?

77
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,160
她是我的保姆
She was my nanny.

78
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,460
你现在还有保姆啊
You still have a nanny?

79
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,270
真幸福
Lucky.

80
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,420
我小时候大多数时间都是她带大的
She took care of me most of my childhood.

81
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,960
我好爱她
I loved her so much.

82
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,380
节哀
So sorry.

83
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,260
我对我的老邻居卡拉
That's kind of how I felt

84
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,100
也有这种感觉
about my old neighbor, Carla.

85
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,500
虽然她没有养育我
I mean, she didn't take care of me,

86
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,740
但在我小的时候  她都允许我
but when I was a kid, she used to let me

87
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,540
喝她家花园水管的水
drink out of her hose.

88
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,080
我最后一次见安东尼娅  是她载我
The last time I saw Antonia, she was driving me

89
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,030
和邋遢鬼妮莉・费塔朵一起去参加青少年选择奖
and a sloppy Nelly Furtado to the Teen Choice Awards.

90
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,030
{\an8}妮莉・费塔朵加拿大女歌手  曾赢得过青少年选择奖

91
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,170
现在可以在办公室里哭了吗
Oh, are we allowed to cry at work now?

92
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,450
我一般只在车里哭
'cause I only do it in my car.

93
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,750
麦克斯  你知道我意识到什么吗
Max, you know what I just realized?

94
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,140
这是我保姆死后  我第一次走进这家餐厅
This is the first time I've been here since my nanny died.

95
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,740
这话你已经在墨西哥快餐店说过了
You just said that at Chipotle.

96
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,580
然后十分钟后  你又说了一遍
And then you said it again ten minutes later,

97
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,990
也是在那家快餐店
also at chipotle.

98
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,570
有点同情心好吗
Show some sensitivity.

99
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,770
我当时哭是因为我保姆死了
I was crying because my nanny died.

100
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,730
也因为我们悼念的早午餐是在一家快餐店
And also because our grief brunch was at Chipotle.

101
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,360
卡洛琳  你的保姆过世啦
Caroline, your nanny passed?

102
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,530
我深表同情  宝贝  太遗憾了
My sympathies, sweetheart. That's a shame.

103
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,000
但没有什么比黑人葬礼更棒的了
But there is nothing better than a black funeral.

104
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,410
我1984年时参加了我爷爷的葬礼  至今宿醉未醒
I'm still hung over from my grandpa's in '84.

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,740
厄尔  我的保姆是白人
Earl, my nanny was white.

106
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,920
你的保姆居然是白人
Your nanny was white?

107
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,520
小姑娘  你的确是富二代啊
Child, you were rich.

108
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,730
你看见阿憨了吗
Have you seen Han?

109
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,070
葬礼明天在费城举行
The funeral's in Philadelphia tomorrow,

110
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,350
我得跟他请一天假
and I need the day off.

111
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,810
我之前好像看见他了
Well, I think I saw him earlier.

112
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,250
但话说回来  那也有可能是一只猫
But then again, it might have been a cat.

113
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,330
我们俩都需要请一天假
Hey, we both need the day off.

114
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,310
我要陪你去  无论是出于精神支持
I'm going with you for moral support/

115
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,480
还是为了吃第一个费城牛肉三明治
my first cheesesteak/

116
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,960
或我想使劲甩独立钟里面的那个大球
I want to ride the liberty bell like a wrecking ball.

117
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,160
我刚在《科技新时代》看到一篇超级疯狂的文章
I just read the craziest article in this Popular Science

118
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,600
是关于"白矮"星  黑"洞"和天王星[你屁眼]
about White Dwarfs, black holes, and Uranus.

119
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,770
不对  让我重新说一遍
Oh, no. Let me start over.

120
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,300
阿憨  我们明天要请假  我保姆过世了
Han, we need tomorrow off. My nanny died.

121
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,730
她就像是我的母亲
She was like a mother to me.

122
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,970
但她不是你的母亲
But she was not your mother.

123
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,470
餐厅有明确的规定
And diner rules clearly state

124
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,060
必须是自己家人的葬礼才能请假
you can only take off for the death of a family member.

125
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,860
餐厅还规定不许在上班时候喝酒呢
Well, the rules also say no drinking on the job,

126
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,310
但现在
but...

127
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
好吧  你可以去
Okay, yes, you can go.

128
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,140
因为在我们国家
Because in my culture,

129
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,950
对长辈是十分尊敬的
it's important to honor the elderly.

130
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,720
我跟一位97的老人同睡上下铺
I shared a bunk bed with a 97-year-old

131
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,980
一直睡到我22岁呢
till I was 22.

132
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,780
敢问你是在"上面"还是"下面"
Were you on the top or bottom?

133
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,750
我向来是在下面啊
Oh, I was always the bottom.

134
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,260
不对  让我重新说一遍
Oh, no. Let me start over.

135
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,940
卡洛琳
Hey, Caroline.

136
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,010
我收到你保姆过世的短信了
I got your nanny death text.

137
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,360
所以我出于尊重  穿上了一身黑
So I'm wearing black out of respect.

138
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,510
而且  刚好我的月事也来了
And also, I got my period.

139
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,640
谢谢  苏菲  太有爱了
Thanks, Sophie. That's lovely.

140
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,730
是吗  哪部分
It is? Which part?

141
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,520
在波兰  我保姆死的时候
You know, back in Poland when my nanny died,

142
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,030
我心都碎了  难过得都吃不下她了
I was so heartbroken, I could barely eat her.

143
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,940
你居然吃你死掉的保姆
You ate your dead nanny?

144
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,470
山羊终究是动物
Well, a goat's a goat.

145
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,200
称呼改变不了本质
It doesn't matter what you name it.

146
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,710
它仍是美味的羊肉
It's still good goat meat.

147
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,500
好了  我去我卡座里坐着了
All right, I'll be in my booth.

148
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,430
一份金枪鱼三明治和三颗痛经药  谢谢
I'm going to order a tuna melt and three Midol, please.

149
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,670
等等  我们要怎么去费城啊
Wait, how are we gonna get there?

150
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,240
碧碧说她有车  我们可以问问她
Oh, Bebe said she had a car, we can just ask her.

151
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,550
我不想跟她坐同一辆车
I don't want to get in a car with her.

152
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,120
我连跟她说话都不想
I don't even want to get in a conversation with her.

153
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,830
我可以载你们去
I can drive you.

154
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,120
但我们得先去我巴克斯县的姐姐家
We just have to stop at my sister's in Bucks County,

155
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,530
拿一个没有任何标记的包裹
pick up an unmarked package,

156
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,460
然后再送到康乃迪克州
and swing by Connecticut to drop it off.

157
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,860
奥列格  这个包裹里有违法的东西吗
Oleg, is there anything illegal about this delivery?

158
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,680
没有  只是几双鞋
No, it's just some shoes...

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,900
里面塞满可卡因而已
stuffed with cocaine.

160
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,860
对了  鞋子是用印度大麻做的哦
Also the shoes are made of hashish.

161
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,560
我还是打给碧碧好了
I'll call Bebe.

162
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,760
好吧  但我要坐后座
Okay, but I'm sitting in the back

163
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,930
因为我不想沾染到她的疯气
'cause I don't want the crazy to get on me.

164
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,170
碧碧  你送我们去葬礼
Bebe, I can't thank you enough

165
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,220
真是太感谢你了
for driving us to the funeral.

166
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,150
现在车速才20迈  其实你可以开快点的
We're only going 20. You can go faster if you want.

167
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,670
是啊  刚有一棵树超过了我们
Yeah, we just got passed by a tree.

168
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,720
你那只爱放屁和神经紧张的可卡犬
And I'm especially thrilled your nervous cocker spaniel

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,590
也跟着来  真让我尤为振奋
with gas and hot spots got to join us.

170
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,210
够了  你现在都开到100迈了
Okay, now you're going 100.

171
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,140
其实你可以开慢点的
We can go slower if you want.

172
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,660
抱歉  我的专长是做事极端
Sorry. Extremes-- that's my thing.

173
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,090
有一次我搬家到东京住了一天
One time I moved to Tokyo for a day.

174
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,560
-麦克斯  又来了  -我知道
- Max, it just hit me again. - I know.

175
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,080
貌似她给那只狗吃了西兰花
It's like she feeds him broccoli.

176
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,000
不是啦
No.

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
是我又想到安东尼娅真的去世了
That Antonia is really dead.

178
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,800
好消息是  根据点评网
Well, the good news is, according to Yelp,

179
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,120
她葬礼距离最出名的那家
she's dead about two blocks

180
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,560
费城牛肉奶酪三明治只有两个街区
From the famous philly cheesesteak place.

181
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,000
麦克斯  放尊重点行吗
Max, show some respect.

182
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,170
我又不认识她
Well, I didn't know her.

183
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,760
老实说  我只当她是帮我和牛肉三明治
In fact, I only know her as the lady who brought me

184
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,080
牵红线的媒人
and cheesesteaks together.

185
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,290
即使我们从未见过面  但对于安东尼娅的家人来说
Even though we've never met, it'll mean so much

186
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,370
我的出席对他们来说意义重大
to Antonia's family that I came out of respect.

187
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,800
对我的心理医生来说也意义重大
It'll mean so much to my therapist

188
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,970
因为我离开我的安全区
that I left my safe zone

189
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,270
还只带了一条狗
and only brought one of the dogs.

190
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,790
麦克斯  你觉得除了我的悼词之外
Max, do you think in addition to my eulogy,

191
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,130
我还应该念几段我儿时的日记吗
I should read something from my childhood journal?

192
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,850
不应该  但我觉得你还是会执意念
I don't, but I think you're gonna do it anyway.

193
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,580
"1997年  圣诞节早上
"Christmas morning, 1997.

194
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,730
安东尼娅用一杯热可可和一根我最爱的
Antonia woke me up with a cup of hot cocoa

195
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,290
薄荷棒棒糖叫醒我
and my favorite peppermint stick,

196
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,310
然后我们开始拆礼物"
and then we opened presents."

197
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,300
1997年  圣诞节早上
Christmas morning, 1997.

198
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,580
我冲我妈脸上泼了一杯冰水
I threw cold water on my mother's face.

199
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,200
直到元旦那天  她人还是没反应
New year's day-- still no movement.

200
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,530
这是我手上唯一一张我们的合影
This is the only picture I still have of us.

201
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,560
那是我们一起过的第一个万圣节
It was our first Halloween together.

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,830
我当时四岁
I was four.

203
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,410
瞧她给我做的那身可爱的小鸡装束
Look at that cute little baby chick costume she made me.

204
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,950
唧唧  唧唧
Peep, peep.

205
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,200
真可爱
Aw, so cute.

206
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,150
看车
Car.

207
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,780
我从来没穿过万圣节服装
I never had a Halloween costume.

208
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,770
我通常是把头发乱糟糟地扎起来
I used to put my hair in a messy bun

209
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,000
然后跌跌撞撞地挨家挨户敲门
and stumble from door-to-door

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,260
告诉大家我就是我妈
telling people I was my mother.

211
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,210
今年万圣节  我打扮成我的医生迈克
This Halloween, I went as my doctor, Michael.

212
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,740
我把我的狗狗打扮成
And I dressed up my buddy here

213
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,800
他的爱人  约瑟夫
As his lover, Joseph.

214
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,960
我们后来情不自禁
We lost.

215
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,780
安东尼娅一直陪在我身边
Antonia was always there for me--

216
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,170
万圣节  圣诞节  复活节  每一个节日
Halloween, Christmas, Easter-- every holiday.

217
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,710
每一天
Really, every day.

218
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,760
她就像我妈妈一样
She was really like a mother to me.

219
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,330
那你真正的妈妈呢
Where was your real mother?

220
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,640
这只是什么品种的狗啊
Hey, what kind of dog is that?

221
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,370
除了"苦瓜脸品种"外
I mean, besides "Sad"?

222
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,670
她妈妈跟人偷情  然后被扫地出门
Her mother had an affair, got pushed out.

223
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,030
那是她的痛处  所以别随便碰
That's her hot spot, so don't lick it.

224
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,710
没关系  麦克斯  我不需要任何保护
It's okay, Max, I don't need any protection.

225
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,060
你不需要任何保护[措施]
You don't need protection?

226
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,180
你是谁  跟我约过会的男人吗
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated?

227
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,730
碧碧  没错  我妈妈是背叛了我爸爸
Bebe, yes, my mother was unfaithful to my father,

228
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,730
所以她被赶走了
so she was sent away.

229
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,290
但我有安东尼娅  她照顾我
But I had Antonia and she took care of me.

230
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,810
她就是我的家人
She was my family.

231
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,060
那一定很难熬  人人都需要妈妈
That must have been hard. Everybody needs a mother.

232
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,690
我没有我妈  一定会疯掉的
I'd be crazy without my mother.

233
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,400
我看病都是她载我去的
She drives me to all my appointments.

234
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,910
但你不是会开车吗
But you drive.

235
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,640
是啊
Yeah...

236
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,940
但医生不让我开
But I'm not supposed to.

237
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,520
我让碧碧在车里等着没事吧
It's okay I asked Bebe to wait in the car, right?

238
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,950
她不会憋死的  有扇车窗留了一条缝
I mean, she'll be okay. We cracked a window.

239
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,000
是啊  她有个碗和一个宠物用咀嚼玩具
Yeah, and she's got a bowl and a chew-toy.

240
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,740
来吧  过来签到
Come on, let's sign in.

241
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,930
麦克斯  当我见到她家人时  我要振作
Max, I have to keep it together when I meet the family.

242
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,990
我不能太动情
I can't be all emotional.

243
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,370
瞧  我的手在抖  太可怕了
Look, my hand's shaking. This is terrible.

244
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,370
干嘛  刚才的签名丑死了
What? It was a terrible signature.

245
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,800
而且那页也只有五个其他人的名字而已
And there were only five other names on the page.

246
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,110
处理掉它
Get rid of it.

247
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,500
"处理掉它"
"Get rid of it"?

248
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,770
你是谁  跟我约过会的男人吗
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated?

249
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,500
"卡洛琳・钱宁"
"Caroline Channing."

250
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,140
给  麦克斯
Here, Max.

251
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,730
瞧
Oh, look.

252
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,500
这里的花和一切都好美
The flowers and everything are so beautiful.

253
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,060
好了
There you go.

254
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,570
你居然签"费成・三明智"
You signed "Phil E. Cheesesteak"?

255
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,470
你告诉我不要再提这件事了
You told me not to mention it anymore,

256
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,600
所以那只是个提醒而已
so it's just a reminder.

257
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,900
麦克斯  到时候一定会有很多人
Okay, Max, there are gonna be a lot of people

258
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,140
想要得到我的关注  所以拜托要耐心
who will want my attention, so please be patient

259
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,450
站在我身边  偶尔给我支持的依靠
and stand next to me for the occasional supportive lean.

260
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,020
如果有人开始哭得太夸张
And if someone starts to get too weepy,

261
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,970
立刻把他们从我身上拉开
push them out of the way

262
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,260
因为这条裙子可不能沾上眼泪
because I can't get tears on this dress.

263
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,670
我明天九点前还得退给百货公司
It has to be back to Barneys by 9:00 A.M.

264
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,380
你来了
You're here.

265
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,170
开始了  麦克斯
Here we go, Max.

266
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,990
我刚是跟他说话
I was talking to him.

267
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,040
当然当然  今天对我们来说都很伤心
Of course you were. It's a very sad day for us all.

268
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,600
真是太伤了
That was rough.

269
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,790
麦克斯  看
Max, look.

270
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,400
这就是安东尼娅
This is Antonia.

271
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,960
她看起来人很好
She looks really nice.

272
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,540
的确
She was.

273
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,550
原来她还在军队待过
I didn't know she was in the military.

274
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,650
{\an8}美军规定床单要掖进床垫下  四个角要折成45度

275
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,650
难怪床单四个边角弄得那么利落
But it does explain those fabulous bed sheet corners.

276
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,780
等等  你居然不知道你的保姆是海军吗
Wait, you didn't know your nanny was a marine?

277
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,490
真是太糟糕了  如果是我就会炫耀
That's too bad, 'cause I'd be all,

278
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,570
"喂  其他有钱的小屁孩
"Yo, other little rich kid!

279
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,070
老娘的保姆能轻易折断你们脖子哦"
My nanny can snap your neck."

280
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,210
瞧  那俩是她的姐妹  塞西莉亚和安吉拉
Oh, look. There are her sisters, Cecelia and Angela,

281
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,780
这几个是她的侄子和侄女
and there are her nieces and nephews.

282
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,950
这些照片居然没一张有我
And there is not me anywhere.

283
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,790
我的照片肯定跟其他重要人物
You know, my picture must be in the coffin

284
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,960
一起放在棺材里
With the other V.I.P.S.

285
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,090
如果你是个重要人物  能叫人上酒吗
If you're a V.I.P., can we get some bottle service?

286
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,130
下午好  女士们
Good afternoon, ladies.

287
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,810
我是安东尼  安东尼娅的侄子
I'm Anthony, Antonia's nephew.

288
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,190
真是令人难过的一天
It's sad day, huh?

289
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,210
没错
Yes, it is.

290
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,970
我觉得我现在也没这么难过了
Think I just got a little less sad.

291
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,060
安东尼
Oh! Anthony!

292
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,780
住手  我们可是一家人
Stop. We're family.

293
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,520
我是卡洛琳・钱宁
I'm Caroline Channing.

294
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,100
我只知道你是卡洛琳辣妹
You're Caroline "Hot," is all I know.

295
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,750
你们俩是要用信封装钱
You ladies need cash envelopes

296
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,330
还是要不要都行
or you guys cool?

297
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,970
我最缺的就是装钱的信封了
I always need a cash envelope.

298
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,800
抱歉  信封要拿来装什么啊
I'm sorry, envelopes for what?

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,020
根据意大利葬礼的习俗  哀悼者瞻仰死者遗容后
Well, at Italian wakes, the mourners give the family

300
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,290
会捐一点钱给死者家属
a donation after they view the deceased.

301
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,180
所以是要"按次收费"瞻仰吗
So it's pay-per-view?

302
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,080
这句吐槽太犀利了
That was a good one.

303
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,740
晚点要一起喝一杯吗
Hey, you want to go get a pop later?

304
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,410
我们完事就走了  但好吧  安东尼
We're leaving right after, but yes, Anthony.

305
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,380
谢谢  麻烦给我们个信封
Thank you. We'll take an envelope.

306
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,090
遗体就在前面
The body's right through there.

307
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,850
一直往前走
Go right ahead.

308
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,270
安东尼  住手
Anthony, stop.

309
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,500
我真的好紧张啊
I'm really nervous.

310
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,340
我以前从来没见过尸体
I've never seen a dead body before.

311
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,530
我见多了
I've seen a bunch.

312
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,460
有几具还是拜我所赐
A couple of them were my fault.

313
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,550
我没有现金
I don't have any cash.

314
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,200
-你有带钱吗  -我看看我的钱包
- Do you have any money? - Let me check my wallet.

315
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,910
这是名牌密封塑胶袋  可不是什么山寨货哦
This is a real Ziploc, not one of those knock-offs.

316
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,480
一定要把信封封好
Make sure you seal the envelope,

317
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,710
好让别人觉得里面都是25美分的硬币
so people think it's all quarters.

318
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,890
麦克斯  下一个到我们了
Max, we're next.

319
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,310
我好害怕  牵住我的手
I'm afraid. Hold my hand.

320
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,680
牵手  你以为我们是什么
Hold hands? What are we?

321
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,140
基督徒约会网站上第五次约会的男女吗
On a ChristianMingle fifth date?

322
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,140
{\an8}该网站是最大的信仰性在线约会网站之一

323
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,630
拜托了  麦克斯  我好紧张啊
Please, Max. I'm nervous.

324
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,840
-天啊  -谢谢
- Oh, God. - Thank you.

325
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
好了  松手
Okay. Now give it back.

326
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,440
干嘛  这已经是我维持最长的一段感情了
What? That was just my longest relationship.

327
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,600
再说了  我得把这些零钱放进信封里
Plus, I need it to put this change in the envelope.

328
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,360
她看起来一脸平静
Oh, she looks so peaceful.

329
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
安东尼娅  我是卡洛琳
Hi, Antonia. It's me, Caroline.

330
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,070
我应该亲她吗  她家人在旁边看着呢
Should I kiss her? The family is right there watching.

331
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,040
前面那个女士就亲了
The lady before us kissed her.

332
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,130
亲吧  反正看样子她也不会推开你
Go for it. Doesn't look like she'd fight you.

333
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,740
好的  数到三
Okay, on the count of three.

334
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,060
一  二
One, two--

335
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,510
不行  麦克斯  牵着我的手
No! Max, hold my hand again while I--

336
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,810
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

337
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,840
住手  别捡了  反正我们也要给她家人的
Wait, leave it! We were giving it to them anyway.

338
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,340
不是全部都给啊  那可是我们买三明治的钱
Not all of it. That's our cheesesteak money.

339
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,190
别捡了  快过来
Leave it. Come on.

340
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,510
刚才的事真是非常抱歉
I am so, so sorry about that.

341
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,120
我实在是太紧张了  你懂的
My nerves got the best of me. You understand.

342
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,060
我是塞西莉亚  安东尼娅的
I'm Cecelia, Antonia's--

343
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,410
妹妹  我知道
Sister. I know.

344
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,130
你们俩长得很像
I see the resemblance.

345
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,310
我是卡洛琳
I'm Caroline.

346
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,670
谁啊  卡洛琳
Caroline who?

347
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,870
卡洛琳・钱宁啊
Oh. Caroline Channing.

348
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,280
谁是卡洛琳・钱宁
Caroline Channing who?

349
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,500
你现在心情不好想不起  可以理解
You're having a hard time processing. Understandable.

350
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,690
今天对我们所有人来说都非常难过
It's been a very emotional day for us all.

351
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,420
这个女孩是谁
Who is this girl?

352
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,650
你  我倒觉得我在哪里见过你
You, I feel like I've seen somewhere.

353
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,810
你是里基在罗彻斯特的女友吗
Are you Ricky's girl From Rochester?

354
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,580
有可能  是的话对我有什么好处
I could be. What's in it for me?

355
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,490
安东尼娅在我小时候照顾过我
Antonia used to take care of me when I was little.

356
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,900
安东尼娅是你的临时保姆啊
Oh, Antonia was your baby-sitter.

357
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,080
你能来真好
Very nice of you to come.

358
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,670
她不是我的"临时保姆"
Well, she was hardly my "baby-sitter."

359
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,360
她十年来的每一天都在照顾我
She took care of me every day for ten years.

360
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,720
我是卡洛琳  卡洛琳・钱宁啊
Caroline. Caroline Channing.

361
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,920
很抱歉  但我真不认识你  亲爱的
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are, sweetheart,

362
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,760
虽然你一直在向我施压  逼我假装认识你
Though it seems to be what you're hammering me about.

363
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,780
容我失陪一下
If you'll excuse me,

364
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,580
我要去抽根烟
I need a cigarette.

365
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,880
抽完了我还得去捡
And then I got to remove

366
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,450
掉在我姐姐身上的钢G
some of those pennies off of my sister.

367
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,260
那是口棺材  不是什么许愿井
It's a coffin, not a wishing well.

368
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,690
这个葬礼变得好令人感到沉重[沮丧]
This funeral turned out to be very depressing.

369
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,550
没错
Well, yeah.

370
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,320
有个死人躺在这里  不死气沉沉都难
Dead body in the room, generally a buzz-kill.

371
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,140
除非这是爱尔兰式守灵
Unless it's an Irish wake--

372
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,720
这样你就可以隔着棺材玩啤酒乒乓啦
then you're playing beer pong off the coffin.

373
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,720
{\an8}爱尔兰人爱喝酒  啤酒乒乓是一种喝酒游戏

374
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,010
我的意思是  这家人
No, I mean, how is it possible

375
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,730
怎么可能没一个人认识我呢
that the family doesn't even know me?

376
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,860
难道安东尼娅从来没提起过我吗
Did Antonia never even mention me?

377
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,380
你应该往好的方面想
Let's focus on the positive.

378
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,640
安东尼真的很喜欢你的小屁屁
Anthony really liked your ass.

379
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,000
我知道我和安东尼娅拥有过什么
I know what Antonia and I had.

380
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,700
这就是我们拥有的回忆
This is what we had.

381
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,760
唧唧  唧唧
Peep, peep.

382
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,290
那是我们的美好回忆
That's what we had.

383
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,270
那已经很多啦
Well, that's a lot.

384
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,280
但我猜这家人不会承认我们的回忆
But I guess no one in this family wants to admit that,

385
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,390
这真是太遗憾了
and it's a shame too,

386
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,260
因为我准备了很棒的悼词
because I had a great eulogy.

387
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,020
是吗
You do?

388
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,000
是的  没错
Yes. I do.

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,540
你想让我跟你分享吗
Would you like me to share it with you?

390
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,140
当然想啊
I most certainly would.

391
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,610
你不是真的要拿你的烂悼词
You are not seriously eulogy-bombing

392
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,660
去精神轰炸那位老太太吧
that old lady, are you?

393
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,730
是她先问起我的悼词的
She asked me about my great eulogy.

394
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,630
她都一百岁了
She's a hundred.

395
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,090
很可能听成你说你有一位很棒的泌尿科医生
She probably thought you said you had a great urologist.

396
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,060
你有笔吗
Do you have a pen?

397
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,740
我要记下她医生的名字
I'm getting the name of her doctor.

398
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,590
不  夫人  我说的不是"泌尿科医生"
No, ma'am, I didn't say, "urologist."

399
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,530
我说的是"悼词"  很棒的悼词[音似]
I said, "eulogy." A great eulogy.

400
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,990
你凭啥上去念悼词啊
Why would you give the eulogy?

401
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,310
因为我是卡洛琳・钱宁
Because I'm Caroline Channing.

402
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,910
谁呀
Who?

403
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,190
卡洛琳・钱宁
Caroline Channing.

404
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,290
卡洛琳・钱宁
Caroline Channing.

405
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,500
安东尼娅是我的保姆
Antonia was my nanny.

406
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,760
我家过去超级有钱
My family was rich,

407
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,380
但后来我父亲骗走了全世界的钱
but then my father robbed everyone,

408
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,800
于是我们沦为害群之马
and we became the scourge of society,

409
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,530
同一周  梅尔・吉布森仇视犹太人的言论
overshadowed a little bit by Mel Gibson

410
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,090
盖过了我家丑闻风头一点点
hating the Jews that same week.

411
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,360
你们绝对应该记得
Surely, you remember?

412
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,370
小宝贝  我连怎么来这里的都不记得了
Honey, I don't even remember how I got here.

413
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,530
真是难以置信
I can't believe this.

414
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,010
我整个童年之所以"快乐"都是因为
I constructed my entire "Happy" Childhood

415
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,590
我坚信  就算我妈离开了我
On the fact that even though my mom left

416
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,130
就算她不爱我
and apparently didn't love me,

417
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,790
但还有安东尼娅爱我
Antonia did.

418
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,520
而我来了这里  我意识到
And now I get here and I realize

419
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,800
没人爱过我  她只是为了挣钱
no one loved me, I was just a paycheck.

420
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,290
我只是她照顾的众多小孩中的一个
One of the many kids she baby-sat.

421
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,060
我甚至不知道我来这里的意义是什么
I don't even know why I bothered to come.

422
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,060
我去一趟洗手间  然后我们就走
I'm going to the restroom and then we can just leave.

423
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,780
打扰一下  你好
Excuse me. Hi.

424
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,870
我是麦克斯  里基的女友
Max, Ricky's girl.

425
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,440
我知道现在你很难过
I know this is a hard time for you,

426
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,520
但对我朋友来说  她也很难过
but it's a hard time for my friend as well.

427
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,150
即使你从来没有听说过她
And even though you never heard of her,

428
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,590
但我恳请你能否过去
I was wondering if you could just go over there,

429
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,630
对她说你想起来了
and say you just remembered her,

430
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,840
安东尼娅经常在你们面前提起她
and that Antonia talked about her all the time?

431
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,220
我明白这是要你说谎推翻你之前的话
I know it's a 180 on your original story and a lie,

432
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,480
我也乐意给你辛苦费
and I'd offer to pay you for your trouble,

433
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,950
但我的养老金全在装着你姐姐的盒子里了
but my 401k is laying in that box on top of your sister.

434
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,180
我是看在你男人里基的面子  才没赶你俩走
Look, I only permitted you two to stay

435
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,230
要不是去年乔舅舅从楼顶摔下来时  
'cause your Ricky was so nice to uncle Joe

436
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,170
全靠他出手相救
when he fell off the roof last year.

437
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,860
但现在  你们还是离开这吧
But now, you gotta go.

438
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,040
好吧  随便你好了
Okay. Be that way.

439
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,470
但下次乔舅舅要去做透析时  里奇不会去接他的
But don't expect Ricky to pick up Uncle Joe for dialysis.

440
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,450
麦克斯  你这是干什么
Max, what are you doing?

441
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,040
是那家人让我贴上去的
The family asked me to put it up.

442
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,810
他们想起你来了
They just remembered you.

443
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,000
天啊
Oh, my God.

444
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,050
我有这么可悲吗  需要你粘照片
I'm so pathetic, you have to put up my picture

445
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,900
来哄我吗
to make me feel better?

446
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,730
在某种程度上  是的
In a way, yes.

447
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,030
这照片本来就应该贴在这里
It belongs up there.

448

你叫谁小鸡仔呢

我  那是安东尼娅给我起的昵称

她非常爱你  我根本没办法抱怨

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,280
之前在雪弗兰里跟九个牛肉三明治
until you've driven two hours in a Chevy

488
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,190
和一只爱放屁的动物待了两个小时  都要死了

你真应该去的
You should have come.

492
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,820
那有不少八九十岁的老辣奶

493
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,970
而且我接收到其中一位超强的"求欢"信号
and I got a definite "jungle fever" vibe from one of them.

494
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,120
像我这种年纪的人  可不想在葬礼上出现
Girl, at my age, you don't go anywhere near funerals.

你还好吧  小鸡仔
Hey, how you holding up, chicken?

我不在乎我的葬礼都有谁出席
I don't care who else is at my funeral,

501
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,070

as long as you're there.

502
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,230
我当然会去
Of course I'll be there.

503
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,110
凶手向来为了甩掉警察而出席葬礼

504
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,270
对了  棺材别花太多钱

505
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,960
给我一套迪奥寿服  化烟熏妆  扔洞里就行了

506
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,510
如果到时我很胖  那就火葬了吧
Unless I'm fat-- then burn me.

我不想要葬礼
Well, I don't want a funeral.

508
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,410
等我死的时候  把我尸体塞进大炮里
When I die, just shove my corpse into a cannon

509
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,470
直接冲着大西洋城特朗普赌场来一发  送我过去
and blow me directly into the Trump casino.
