这座城市曾经是我的家

00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:10,006
我不在的日子里
马赛尔得到了我想要的一切

Marcel has got everything I ever wanted.

allegiance to you.

你现在拥有我的王国
You have the keys to my kingdom.

7
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,207
你将再一次为他而放弃我，是吗？
You're choosing him over me,
aren't you, again?

8
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,717
所有爱尼克劳斯的人得到的回报

尼克劳斯，她怀了你的孩子

11
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,216
你跟我走，小狼
You're coming with me, little wolf.

12
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,228
我现在在万能克劳斯的保护下
I've been deemed under
protection by the almighty Klaus.

13
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,367
我想是时候让我侄女卡蜜离开这里了
I believe it is time for my niece, Cami,
to leave town.

14
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,799
离开纽奥良
忘记所有一切
Leave New Orleans.
Forget everything.

15
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,764
我认识你吗？
Do I know you?

16
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,201
你被魅惑了
You've been compelled.

17
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,103
没事的，我能解除你的魅惑
It's okay. I can fix you.

to New Orleans looking for a fresh start,

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,086

从法国来的年轻社交名媛获得许诺
Young society women, imported from
France with the promise of marrying

22
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:09,560
能嫁给体面的纽奥良绅士
就像传说中的木匣女孩
a proper New Orleans gentleman.
Like the legendary Casket Girls.

23
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,795
打扰一下，先生

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,374
还有多久才能到总督府呢？

25
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,545
她们并不知道等待着她们的男人
不仅毫不体面
Little did they know that the men who
awaited them were far from proper.

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,914
而且一点也不绅士
And not at all gentle.

27
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,395
让她们出来，我们要见女人

女人如何被自私男人压迫
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
can be oppressed by selfish men...

41
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,160
以及她们勇敢地为自己而战
最终获得胜利
...and how they can triumph when brave
enough to fight for themselves.

42
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,893
天啊，好痛！
Oh, God, it hurts!

抱歉，卡蜜
这是解除克劳斯魅惑的唯一办法
I'm sorry, Cami. It's the only way
to break all of Klaus' compulsion.

你会没事的
Believe me, I know what it's like.
You're okay.

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,467
那个，你写的这些纸条
And, hey,
all these notes that you made?

46
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,007
（别相信克劳斯）

47
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,372

Nice work.

我不明白我究竟发生了什么事
主演：克莱儿荷特

50

这一切我都不明白

I don't understand any of this.

51

When I am done,
you will understand all of it,

56

00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,862
如果你想，我可以停下来
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
I can stop if you want me to.

58
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,127
不，别停下来
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
No. Don't stop.

59
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,428
我想记起一切

62
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,049
你需要帮忙吗？
Would you like some help?

63
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,854
你可能得用上你全部的吸血鬼力量
You might need to use
all your vampire strength.

64
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,219
让我来吧
Allow me.

65
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,770
谢谢
Thanks.

66
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,133
没有几个木匣女孩是大着肚子的吧
Not too many pregnant
Casket Girls, I guess.

67
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,368
我觉得你很美
但我得…
I think you look lovely.
Only I would--

68
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:45,278
我知道，得把那奇怪的狼人胎记遮住
I know, keep the
freaky werewolf birthmark covered.

69
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,816
我不认为这里的．乌合之众
Well, I don't suspect
any of the riffraff here

70
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,385
会胆敢伤害你
would dare lay a hand on you,

71
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,548
明知你在我们家族的保护之下
制片：兰斯安德森
knowing that you're
under the protection of my family.

72
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,750
不过还是小心为妙
Still, we shouldn't take any chances.

73
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,655
被搞大了肚子且无处可去
All knocked up and nowhere to go.

74
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,437
这样吧
如果你想参加今晚的节日庆典
You know, if you wanted
to attend the festivities tonight,

75
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,835
我很乐意带你去
I'd be more than willing to take you.

76
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,039
你和克劳斯现在闹得那么僵
制片：邦妮怀斯
You and Klaus are
barely on speaking terms.

77
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,343
还是不要平生事端了，对吧？
Let's not rock the boat, okay?

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,719
当然
Of course.

79
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,582
以利亚
Elijah.

80
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,193
能帮我一下吗？
Do you mind?

81
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,427
当然
Not at all.

导演：杰西瓦恩

84
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,951
平庸，沉闷，丑爆
Dull, dreary, hideous.

85
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,060
是在说衣服呢，还是另有所指？
Talking about the clothes,
or something else?

86
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,525
怎么，缺乏安全感吗？
Why, feeling insecure?

87
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,926
这个节日可以说是因我而创
This festival might as well
be in my honor.

88
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,261
我需要一身合适的衣服，别烦我
I need a proper costume,
so bugger off.

89
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,371
- 蕾贝卡
- 别碰我
-Rebekah.
-Don't.

90
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,430
你已经做出了选择
You made your choice.

91
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,608
你和克劳斯又成为好朋友了
You and Klaus are best friends again.

92
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,249
你已经放弃了动我的权利
You've relinquished
your right to touch me.

93
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,349
会是谁打来的呢？
I wonder who that could be.

94
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,422
什么事？
(PHONE BEEPS)
What's up?

95
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,790
出了点问题
Bit of an issue.

96
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,955
似乎我们的小鸟从笼子里飞走了
Seems our little bird
has flown the coop.

97
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,774
你应该会开始有如释重负的感觉
You should start to feel it,
like a weight lifting.

98
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,414
现在你的小纸条可就容易理解多了
And your cheat sheets are
about to make a lot more sense.

99
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,676
我保证，只要没人再追捕我
I promise, as soon as
the world stops hunting me,

100
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,342
我一定会找到日光戒指的咒语
I will find the daylight ring spell.

101
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,284
我明白，你现在不用烦心这事
I know.
Just don't worry about that right now.

102
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,755
我记得我为什么会写下这个了
I remember why I wrote this.

103
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,822
我找到一张1919年的照片
上面有克劳斯和马赛尔
I found a picture of
Klaus and Marcel from 1919.

104
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,670
克劳斯魅惑我让我和马赛尔约会
以便监视他
Klaus compelled me to go out
with Marcel, to spy on him.

105
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,646
他昨天告诉过我
在他让我忘记一切之前
That's what he said yesterday,
before he told me to forget.

106
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,649
我想起来了
I'm remembering.

107
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,614
我们继续解除之前的魅惑吧
Let's take you back more.

108
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,236
离开纽奥良
Leave New Orleans.

109
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,874
忘了我
Forget me.

110
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,100
你哥哥病了
Your brother was ill.

111
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,438
你没有留在这里的理由
You have no reason to stay.

112
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,486
就算不是神探也能看出来
You don't have to be
Sherlock Holmes to know the obvious.

113
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,648
我们的秘密武器逃走了
Our secret weapon has escaped.

114
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,054
她不会就这么走的
She wouldn't just leave.

115
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,957
她知道女巫在找她
She knows the witches want her back.

116
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,289
她的小提琴也不见了
Her violin is missing.

117
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,762
她应该是自愿离开的
She may have left
of her own volition.

118
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,560
你在阁楼和她说了什么？
What did you say to her in the attic?

119
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,225
她为了继续待在那里对我撒谎
She lied to my face
so she could stay up there,

120
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,304
以为你会帮她控制她的法力
thinking that you'd
help her control her magic.

121
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,303
我们怎么知道是不是你把她带走了
How do we know
that you didn't take her?

122
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,170
我不知道黛维娜在哪，为什么要逃跑
I have no idea where Davina is
or why she ran away.

123
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,677
还有你能别离我这么近吗？
Can I suggest you take a step back?

124
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,111
我可以保证，我绝不想
I can assure you,
I have absolutely no desire

125
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,380
看到那孩子受到伤害
to see that child
come into harm's way.

126
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,990
那个荒谬的收获祭仪式
让她吃尽了苦头
She's suffered enough
with this Harvest ritual nonsense.

127
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,683
你充满慈爱地说到的那个女孩
That child to whom
you refer so affectionately,

128
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,261
正是纽奥良最厉害的女巫
is the most powerful witch
in New Orleans.

129
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,024
如果她跑了，要如何阻止她摧毁我们？
If she's fled,
what's to stop her from destroying us?

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,725
事实上是摧毁我们苦心经营的一切？
In fact, destroying all we've worked for?

131
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,097
不
No.

132
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,240
如果她不是我们的朋友
就是我们的敌人
If she's not a friend to this family,
then she is our enemy.

133
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,636
她是我们的朋友，克劳斯
She is a friend, Klaus.

134
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,334
但愿如此
Well, let's hope so.

135
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,707
算你走运，我知道怎么把她找回来
Lucky for you,
I know how to get her back.

136
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,641
听我指挥
Follow my lead.

137
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,215
你知道尼克劳斯的作风
You know how Niklaus operates.

138
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,121
如果他觉得自己受到了威胁
他会变得残忍无情
If he perceives a threat,
he can become quite ruthless.

139
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,485
这对黛维娜来说很不妙
This would not bode well for Davina.

140
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,325
我不会让任何人伤害她
I'm not gonna let anybody
lay a finger on her.

141
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,957
我也不会
Nor will l.

142
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,402
听说小女巫不见了，是吗？
So the witch is missing, huh?

143
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,378
显然是从正门出去的
知道怎么回事吗？
Walked right out the front door.
Know anything about it?

144
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,277
不知道
No.

145
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,216
不过我确实有跟她说
那些女巫长老已经死了
Although I did tell her that
the witch elders were dead.

146
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,356
那些女巫想杀了她来献祭
她怎么会在意呢？
Why would she care when the witches
tried to kill her in their ritual?

147
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,288
我想应该是马赛尔没告诉她
I think it was more that Marcel
didn't tell her that the one thing

148
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,928
让她重获自由的障碍已经清除了
preventing her from being free
had been eliminated.

149
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,893
这么说她跑掉还是你引起的
So you are the reason she's run off.

150
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:05,162
嘿，我只是实话实说
Hey, I was just telling her the truth.

151
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,699
是她自己意识到他们只是利用她
She's the one who realized
they were just using her

152
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,501
来控制女巫
to keep their control
over the witches.

153
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,803
我对男子俱乐部从来就不感兴趣
Well, I've never been
a fan of the boys' club.

154
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,979
等着吧，以利亚会加入他们
他们三个一定合不来的
Just wait. Elijah will join them,
and the three of them will be impossible.

155
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,547
被女巫利用，被马赛尔蒙骗
Used by the witches,
lied to by Marcel,

156
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,783
被以利亚操控，被克劳斯威胁
manipulated by Elijah,
threatened by Klaus.

157
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,859
她就是现代版的木匣女孩
She's like a modern-day Casket Girl.

158
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,855
你说的是黛维娜还是你自己？
Are you talking about Davina
or yourself?

159
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,196
有关系吗？
Does it matter?

160
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,065
不管怎样，我们女生必须团结起来
Either way, us girls
have got to stick together.

161
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,954
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to interrupt.

162
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,764
打了一个小时的电话给你
Been calling you for like an hour.

163
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,904
我以为这样你就明白了
I thought you'd have taken the hint.

164
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,237
爱格妮丝死后你就一直这样浑浑噩噩的
You've been acting like this
since Agnes was killed.

165
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,878
可不，但能怪我吗？
Yeah. Can you blame me?

166
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,106
最近又没多少事可做
It's not like I have a lot
to keep me going these days.

167
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,278
当你随便找个大街上的人
While you've been
drowning your sorrows

168
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,647
来抚平内心悲痛的时候
by nailing everything that walks,

169
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,917
我一直在四处观察
低调行事，打探消息
I've been doing my tours,
keeping my head down and my ears open.

170
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:37,256
马赛尔的日行者正在全城上下
找一个女孩
Marcel's Daywalkers are scouring
the whole town looking for a girl,

171
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,888
棕发蓝眼
听来熟悉吗？
brown hair, blue eyes.
Sound familiar?

172
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:47,800
如果黛维娜没和马赛尔在一起
他就不会知道我们在使用魔法
If Davina is not with Marcel,
he won't know if we're practicing magic.

173
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,773
而如果我们可以找到她
一切都得以补救
And if we can actually get her back,
we can fix everything.

174
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,709
太阳要下山了
会有更多吸血鬼出来找人
Sun goes down,
vampire search parties quadruple.

175
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,913
我从她家的老房子里找到了这个
I got this from her family's old house.

176
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,080
应该可以施定位咒
Feel like a locator spell?

177
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,327
继续喝
Keep drinking.

178
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,589
你要让体内充满马鞭草
这样你就不会再被魅惑了
You need the vervain in your system
so you can't be compelled again.

179
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:17,896
卡蜜
你家冰箱里有人血吗？
Hey, Cami, you don't have any, like,
human blood in your fridge, do you?

180
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,596
怎么会有呢？来吧
For crying out loud, here.

181
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,411
黛维娜？
Davina?

182
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,277
有人在使用魔法
Someone is practicing magic.

183
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,691
她们在找我
They're trying to find me.

184
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,360
那我们必须马上离开
Then we have to run.

185
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,099
我现在不可能逃出法语区的
There is no way to sneak me
out of The Quarter.

186
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,703
每个人都在找我
By now, everyone is looking for me.

187
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,533
女巫、马赛尔、克劳斯
The witches, Marcel, Klaus.

188
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,402
- 我叔叔会有办法的
- 卡蜜
-My uncle will know what to do.
-Cami.

189
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,907
他得知道这里到底发生了什么事
He has to know some of what's
going on in this town, right?

190
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,273
- 卡蜜，别说了，他都知道
- 除非他也被魅惑了
-Cami, stop. He knows.
-Unless he's been compelled.

191
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,974
- 你在说什么啊？
- 他都知道
-What are you talking about?
-He knows.

192
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,179
他和马赛尔是一伙的
He works with Marcel.

193
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,879
他们算得上是朋友
我听到他们的谈话
They're practically friends.
I hear them talk.

194
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,614
他知道所有事情
He knows everything.

195
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,520
不会的
No.

196
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,629
如果他知道女巫对我哥哥下了咒
他会告诉我的
He would've told me if he knew
the witches put a hex on my brother.

197
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,333
他真的知道吗？
He knows?

198
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,305
卡蜜
Cami...

199
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,968
天啊
Oh, my God.

200
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,677
他知道
He knows.

201
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,856
你们真的该走了，现在就走
Hey, you guys seriously need to go.
Like, now.

202
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,057
飞机、火车、汽车，坐什么都行
Plane, train, automobile, whatever.

203
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,032
开我的车，就停在码头边
我传简讯告诉你它的位置
Take my car. It's parked down at
the docks, I'll text you to where.

204
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,671
把你的号码存进卡蜜的手机
Put your number in Cami's phone.

205
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,535
法语区大部分已经封锁
我们得步行
Most of the quarter is shut down
right now, we'll have to walk.

206
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,767
而且太阳一直不下山
And the sun is taking
forever to go down.

207
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,175
嘿，别哭
Hey, no tears.

208
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,249
答应我天一黑你就来和我们会合
Promise you'll meet us
as soon as it gets dark out.

209
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,447
好的，别担心我
别让他们找到你
Yeah, don't worry about me.
Just don't let them find you.

210
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,550
我知道克劳斯派你们跟着我
I know Klaus told you to follow me,

211
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,322
但你们真的有必要
跟着我去洗手间吗？
but does it really mean
you have to follow me to the bathroom?

212
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,496
（苏菲德弗罗来电）

213
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,567
给我两分钟
是我的妇产科医生
Just give me two minutes.
It's my gynecologist.

214
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,975
你到底要干什么？
What the hell do you want?

215
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,776
我知道你不信任我
I know you don't trust me.

216
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,179
不过你得听我说
But you need to listen.

217
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,548
一切即将发生变化
Everything is about to change.

218
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,814
黛维娜溜出来了
Davina is on the loose.

219
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,185
你查得很清楚是吗？
Figured that out on your own, huh?

220
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,793
但这跟我有什么关系呢？
Remind me again
why I should give a damn.

221
00:14:55,961 --> 00:15:00,057
我需要你的帮助
好让女巫们完成收种祭
I need something from you, so that
the witches can complete the Harvest.

222
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,531
我凭什么要帮你们女巫获得更多力量？
On what planet would I help
you witches get more power?

223
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,761
你们一直在对我施咒
All you've done is
hex me left and right.

224
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,839
因为如果我们不完成收获祭
You'll help me because
if we don't complete the Harvest,

225
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,704
我们就会永远失去法力
our access to magic
will fade for good,

226
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,777
这对你的家族没有好处
which doesn't bode
well for your family.

227
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,075
你怎么知道我家族的事？
What do you know about my family?

228
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,350
你是新月狼族的一员
You're from the
Crescent Wolf bloodline.

229
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,489
马赛尔强迫一个女巫施咒
使他们只能保持狼形
Marcel forced a witch to curse them
so they'd be trapped in wolf form.

230
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,820
给我一个理由让我不挂电话
And I should keep
listening to you because--?

231
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,587
因为施咒的女巫是我的祖先
Because my bloodline
executed that curse.

232
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:37,065
你帮助我完成收获祭
我就帮你解除咒语
Help me complete the Harvest,
and I'll undo the curse for you.

233
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,128
但我能做什么呢？
But what can I do?

234
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,773
我需要一名强大女巫的遗骨来献祭
I need to consecrate the remains
of a powerful witch

235
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,434
以便吸取她们的法力
so I can absorb their magic.

236
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,637
我知道有个女巫的尸体从未被找到
I know of one whose
body was never found.

237
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,543
她叫莎莉丝特杜博
Her name is Celeste Dubois.

238
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,583
你们应该有一个共同的朋友
I believe you and she
have a friend in common.

239
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,276
以利亚
Elijah.

240
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,854
据说她死后
Story goes that when she died,

241
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,753
以利亚依照她的遗愿
将她埋在了秘密地点
he buried her in a secret spot
at her request.

242
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,819
你只需要找出那个地方
All you need to do is find out where.

243
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,213
现在到处都是人
There's people everywhere.

244
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,181
继续走，没人会认出你来
Just keep walking.
No one knows it's you.

245
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,451
卡蜜
Cami.

246
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,686
我们得离开这条街
We have to get off this street.

247
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,036
如果发现什么情况，基兰会打给我
Kieran is gonna call me first
if he hears anything.

248
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,271
你们俩看起来很悠闲嘛
Well, you two look rather cozy.

249
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,245
没有，我刚跟以利亚说我们在浪费时间
Hardly. I was just telling Elijah
how we're wasting time.

250
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,884
你不喜欢节日庆典吗？
You don't like festivals?

251
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,713
为什么不呢？
I don't see why not?

252
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,488
谁会不喜欢街头市集？
Who doesn't love a street fair?

253
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,216
妹妹，你是来帮我们找人的吗？
Sister, come to help us
find our stray?

254
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,191
总不能让你的秘密武器
落到别人手里，对吧？
We can't let your secret weapon
get in the wrong hands, can we?

255
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,430
声明一下，我们很快就会找到她
For the record, we are
moments away from retrieving her.

256
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,194
你这语气我很熟悉呢，尼克劳斯
I recognize that tone of voice, Niklaus.

257
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,394
显然你又有阴谋诡计了
Clearly, you have some
diabolical machination.

258
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,833
是什么？
What is it?

259
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,540
提摩西
Timothy.

260
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,172
我能跟你聊聊吗？
Might I have a word?

261
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,880
卡蜜，是我，又来骚扰你了
Cami, hey, it's me.
Again. Stalking you.

262
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,519
我只是想知道你们在哪
Just really need to know
where you guys are,

263
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,886
这样才能在日出前跟你们会合
so I can meet you before
the sun comes up, again.

264
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,753
（未知来电）

265
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,556
喂？
Uh, hello?

266
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,224
约书亚，最让我失望的奴才
Joshua, my most
disappointing minion,

267
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,200
如果是我打给你，你应该不会接
I suspected you wouldn't answer
the call were it from me.

268
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,102
克劳斯，你好吗？
Klaus, hey, what up?

269
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,675
你猜怎么着？我搬来土耳其了
Guess what?
I just moved to Turkey.

270
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,438
很奇怪，土耳其人居然不吃火鸡
奇怪吧
Weirdly, they don't eat turkey here.
Go figure.

271
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,636
你在撒谎
You're lying.

272
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,976
实际上，我跟马赛尔刚刚还在说
In fact, Marcel and I were just
chatting about your failed

273
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,277
你这个双面间谋已经暴露
我们推测你应该
double-agent status,
and we've surmised that you're likely

274
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,513
还在城里，而且跟一个朋友在一起
still in town
and in the company of a friend.

275
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,615
一个年轻愤怒的女巫
Ayoung, angry witch.

276
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,122
不，不，这里没有女巫
不过火鸡很好吃
Uh, nope. No witches here.
Totally digging Turkey, though.

277
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,455
你确定要让黛维娜的
小提琴手真爱提摩西
Are you really gonna leave Davina's
fiddler soulmate, Timothy,

278
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,063
跟我独处吗？
alone with me?

279
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,100
小约
Oh, Josh.

280
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,099
她会怎么想呢？
What would she think of that?

281
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,637
我保证我只是想跟她聊聊
I assure you,
I just want to talk to her.

282
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,475
我跟提姆在宅邸那边等你
Tim and I will be at the compound.

283
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,335
我真希望她快点回家
I really do hope she comes home soon.

284
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,324
我们应该继续走
We should keep moving.

285
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,589
要等多久？
How long do we have to wait?

286
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,494
等几分钟吧
然后我去看看海岸是否安全
Give it a few minutes.
Then I'll check to see if the coast is clear.

287
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,171
小约，抱歉没接到你的电话
(PHONE BEEPS)
Josh, sorry I missed your calls.

288
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,136
什么？
What?

289
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,303
我不想告诉你的，但我了解克劳斯
I didn't want to tell you,
but I know Klaus.

290
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,574
如果黛维娜不出现，他会杀了提姆
If Davina doesn't show up,
he'll kill Tim.

291
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,110
我们会想办法的
We'll think of something.

292
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,015
你去法语区，注意别被发现
Make your way to the Quarter.
Stay hidden.

293
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,655
我们想到办法会传简讯给你
We'll text you when we have a plan.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

294
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,851
- 我要去找他
- 黛维娜，等等
-I have to go.
-Davina, wait.

295
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,424
我不能让提姆死
I can't let Tim die.

296
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,360
怎么了？
What's wrong?

297
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,862
那些女巫
The witches.
(DOOR OPENS)

298
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,007
不！
No!

299
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,229
卡蜜？
Cami?

300
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,774
我只是去拿几件衣服
I'm just grabbing some clothes.

301
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,447
给我两分钟，好吗？
Give me two minutes, please?

302
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,619
莎莉丝特让我着迷
ELlJAH: Celeste entrances me.

303
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,755
她完美无瑕
She is perfection.

304
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,524
她死了
She is dead.

305
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,893
即使太阳升起，我眼中只有黑夜
Even as the sun rises,
I see only night.

306
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,835
但我向她保证过
如果她死了
But for the promise
I made to her, that in death

307
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,770
我会将她葬在远离一切混乱的地方
I would bury her far
from the mayhem of witches,

308
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,341
远离女巫、吸血鬼，以及人类
vampires, and men.

309
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,342
对不起，以利亚
I'm so sorry, Elijah.

310
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,218
别紧张，是我，别对我出手
Hey. It's just me.
Don't, like, melt me.

311
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,421
你怎么在这里？
你应该躲起来的
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be hidden.

312
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,429
是的，你不也一样吗？
但你那一脸
So are you. Remember?
But you're kind of working that

313
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,932
“我要复仇”的表情让我十分担心
whole girl on a mission look
that makes me nervous.

314
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,869
你确定你要去招惹那个
Look, are you sure that you
really want to mess with

315
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,472
史上最坏的家伙吗？
the baddest dude
in all of history?

316
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,403
是他先带走提姆，招惹了我
He messed with me when he took Tim.

317
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,671
我要杀了他，杀了他们所有人
I'll kill him, all of them.

318
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,745
黛维娜，真祖是杀不死的
Davina, Originals can't be killed.

319
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,677
或许可以呢
Maybe they can.

320
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,512
我有着无穷的力量
我从未有像现在一样的感觉
I have so much power,
I've never felt anything like it before.

321
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,356
那些力量正在我体内增长积聚
It's growing, gathering inside me.

322
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,482
我很强大，小约
I'm strong, Josh.

323
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,895
- 如果你杀了他们，那么
- 什么？
-lf you kill them, then--
-What?

324
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,833
如果你真要这么做
就不要退缩
If you're gonna do it,
don't hold back.

325
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,234
用你所有的力量对付他们
You hit them with all you got.

326
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:38,353
真成人啊
你没告诉黛维娜如果她杀了克劳斯
That was very sweet, not telling Davina
that if she kills Klaus

327
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,184
你也会死，真是太高尚了
you die, too.
Very noble.

328
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,891
问题是，如果她真要去找我哥哥算帐
Problem is,
if she goes after my brother,

329
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,120
死的人会是她
she'll be the one who ends up dead.

330
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:49,597
这注定是个悲剧，送死也就没必要了
A very unnecessary end
to an already tragic story.

331
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,270
或许你愿意助我一臂之力帮帮她
Perhaps you'd like to help me help her.

332
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,074
蕾贝卡去哪了？
Where's Rebekah gotten off to?

333
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,110
我倒不担心蕾贝卡
It's not Rebekah that
I'm concerned about.

334
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,373
你怎么确定黛维娜一定会来？
And how are you be so
certain that Davina will come?

335
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,483
这么说会让别人以为你已经忘记了
One might think you've forgotten
what it's like to be in the grip

336
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,848
深陷在疯狂的迷恋中不能自拔的感觉
她会来的
of an all-consuming infatuation.
She'll come.

337
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,218
有必要搞得那么悲情吗，尼克劳斯？
Are the maudlin theatrics
absolutely necessary, Niklaus?

338
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,850
有道理
(VlOLlN PLAYlNG)
It's a fair point.

339
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,894
提摩西，能换首欢快点的曲子吗？
Timothy, play something
a little more upbeat, please.

340
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,664
真是个好孩子
That's a good lad.

341
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,367
派你去传个话，去得还真是久啊
Took you long enough
to spread the word.

342
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,063
你见过他的夜行者吗？
Have you met his Nightwalkers?

343
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,799
都不太灵光
Not the brightest assortment.

344
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,069
不管怎样，我都办妥了
All that matters is I got it covered.

345
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,271
黛维娜来了以后
你们俩要让我跟她谈
When Davina gets here, you two
need to let me do the talking.

346
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,313
你会有机会的
Well, I'm sure you'll have your chance.

347
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,249
你好，亲爱的
Hello, love.

348
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:45,050
沉默是金，谢谢你，提摩西
Silence is golden, Timothy.
Thank you.

349
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,357
黛维娜？
Davina?

350
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,157
我已经来了，让他下来
You got me here.
Now let him down.

351
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,698
我们得先谈谈关于你
回到我们身边的问题
Well, first, we have to have a little chat
about you returning to the fold.

352
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,568
我怎么跟你说的，克劳斯
让我来
What did I say, Klaus?
I got this.

353
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,739
小黛，发生什么事了？
D, what happened?

354
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:03,966
你为什么要逃走？
Why'd you run?

355
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,843
告诉我
我能帮你解决问题
Talk to me.
Hey, I can make it right.

356
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,708
怎么解决？威胁我的朋友吗？
How, by threatening my friend?

357
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,473
事实上那是我的主意
Actually, that was my idea.

358
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,244
我很抱歉
有时我为了表明立场做得有点过火
Apologies. I've been known to go
too far to make a point.

359
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,149
但这样确实很管用
But I do always get results.

360
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:23,083
你装出一副很自信的样子
但我知道真相
You pretend to be so confident,
but I know the truth.

361
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,288
你害怕大家看到你真正的一面
You're afraid everyone can see
what you really are.

362
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,563
一头野兽
An animal.

363
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,471
怪物
A beast.

364
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,149
为何不让我们看看你的真面目呢？
Why don't you show us your real face?

365
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,626
我受够你了
That's enough of you.

366
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,891
黛维娜，你不必这么做的
Davina, you don't have to do this.

367
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,123
你
You.

368
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,768
你当着我的面欺骗了我
You looked me in the eyes
and lied to my face.

369
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,962
假装你想要帮我
Pretended you wanted to help me.

370
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,231
听我说
Listen to me.

371
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:10,738
你自称是高尚的人
You call yourself the noble one,

372
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,343
但却跟你弟弟一样是个杀人凶手
but you're a killer
just like your brother.

373
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,810
一千年来，你以无辜人们的鲜血为食
For a thousand years,
you fed on innocent blood.

374
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,581
让你试试被鲜血噎死的滋味如何
Why don't you choke on it?

375
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,660
还有你
And you.

376
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,360
我曾那么信任你
I trusted you.

377
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,668
深爱着你
但你却只是利用我巩固你的势力
I loved you. But you were
just using me to stay in power.

378
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,207
你根本不关心我
You don't care about me.

379
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,605
你错了
You're wrong.

380
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,804
当你败给克劳斯
你就把我当作战利品给了他
When you lost to Klaus,
you handed me over like some trophy.

381
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,577
或许我该用铜锅煮了你
Maybe I should boil you in bronze.

382
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,742
我关心你
I care.

383
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,081
我视你如己出
I took you in like
you were my own blood.

384
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,292
不会吧，亲爱的
Come on now, love.

385
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,331
别跟我说你信他这一套
Don't tell me you were falling for that.

386
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,871
我们女孩们是不是该好好聊聊了？
Isn't it time for us girls
to have a chat?

387
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,777
这真是让人印象深刻
Now, that is impressive.

388
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,573
要我说，他们都罪有应得
And well-deserved, in my opinion.

389
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,484
在你对付我之前
我有个惊喜给你
Now, before you turn on me,
I have a surprise for you.

390
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,989
小约，你怎么来了？快走
Josh, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

391
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,926
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

392
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,792
如果我是克劳斯
我会将小约的头扭下来
Now, if I were Klaus,
I would rip Josh's head from his neck,

393
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,765
喂给夜行者
这将是你朋友的下场
feed it to a Nightwalker, and
that would be the end of your friend.

394
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,640
但伤害他人是男孩子才喜欢干的事
But hurting people is
such a boyish thing to do,

395
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,574
就像克劳斯如何魅惑那位
屋顶上的提琴手
Iike how Klaus compelled
your fiddler on the roof.

396
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,648
虽然我喜怒无常
但我绝对不像我哥哥
And, while I am many things,
I'm certainly not my brother.

397
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,411
没事了，提摩西，你可以下来了
没人会伤害你的
It's okay, Timothy. You can come down.
No one is going to hurt you.

398
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,486
他告诉我不能从横梁上爬下来
He told me I couldn't
climb down off this beam.

399
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,452
那就别用爬的，傻瓜
Then don't climb, silly.

400
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,751
我是这里唯一有脑子的吗？
跳啊
Am I the only smart one in the room?
Jump.

401
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,243
黛维娜，这些你是怎么做到的？
Davina, did you do all that?

402
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,419
我是怎么到这里的？
How did I even get here?

403
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,885
我会解释的，我保证
I'll explain everything, I promise.

404
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,565
你为什么这么做？
Why are you doing this?

405
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,673
在我看来，你掌控着整个局势
Seems to me that
you're the one holding all the cards,

406
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,832
但却不知道该相信谁
yet you don't know who to trust.

407
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,671
我向你证明了你可以相信我
I've just proven
that you can trust me.

408
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,506
现在我想再告诉你一件事
Now I'd like to show you
one more thing.

409
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,278
不会耽误很久
It won't take long.

410
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,515
你可以带着你的朋友
You can bring your friends.

411
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,491
苏菲，我把知道的都告诉你了
Sophie, I told you
everything that I found.

412
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,094
你说他把她埋在了
两棵可爱的橡树苗之间
You said he buried her
between two lovely oak saplings.

413
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,594
这已经是两百年前的事了
News flash, that was 200 years ago.

414
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,095
它们现在早就是大树了
They're all just trees now.

415
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,461
你想成为全能女巫，就继续找啊
You want to be the all-powerful witch,
keep looking.

416
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,624
做个祷告
Say a prayer.

417
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,033
有点信心
你可以的
Have a little faith.
You can do this.

418
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,302
好吧
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Okay.

419
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,150
拜托，请帮帮我
Please, please help me.

420
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,324
我在努力做正确的事
I'm trying to do the right thing.

421
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,395
别担心，他们不是真的死了
只是非常饿
Oh, don't worry. They're not really dead.
Just really hungry, and...

422
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,428
这样说也不会好点的
And I'm not helping.

423
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,065
你觉得我哥哥尼克很坏吗？
马赛尔算是得他真传了
You think my brother, Nik, is awful?
Marcel learned from the best.

424
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,805
他就是这样对待背叛他的
他所谓的朋友
This is how he treats his
so-called friends who betray him.

425
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:46,610
这里大部分可怜的家伙所做的
都不会比小约做的过分
Most of what these poor souls did
is no worse than what Josh did.

426
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,844
拿提艾里来说吧
Take Thierry, for example.

427
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,988
他曾是马赛尔最信任的朋友
He was Marcel's most trusted friend.

428
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,589
克劳斯设计让他
打破了马赛尔的一条规矩
Klaus tricked him into
breaking one of Marcel's rules.

429
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,355
马赛尔明知如此
还是把提艾里关在这里
Marcel knows this, and yet
he keeps Thierry locked in here

430
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,227
日复一日地受折磨
day after day suffering.

431
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,799
真是疯了
This is insane.

432
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,403
你为什么告诉我这些？
Why are you telling me this?

433
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,837
因为你得知道你要对付的是谁
Because you need to know
who you're dealing with,

434
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,499
谁是你可以信任的人
who you can trust.

435
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,913
嘿，嘿，没事的
Hey, hey.
It's gonna be okay.

436
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,143
你不会有事的
I mean, you know,
you're gonna be all right.

437
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:24,748
来
Here.

438
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,356
喝点水吧
Drink something.

439
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,191
黛维娜，你和我都被马赛尔和克劳斯
Davina, both you and
I have been lied to

440
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,058
欺骗和利用了
and taken advantage of
by Marcel and Klaus.

441
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,223
也许我们联手能够给他们小小的报复
Maybe together,
we can get a little payback.

442
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,268
提姆？
Tim?

443
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,806
是克劳斯
It was Klaus.

444
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,675
他逼我这么做的
He made me do it.

445
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,511
我之前都不知道自己在做什么
直到我让你…
I didn't even know what I was
doing until I made you...

446
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,284
让她什么？
Made her what?

447
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,389
喝水
Drink.

448
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,693
- 提姆？
- 克劳斯在水里下毒了
-Tim?
-Klaus poisoned the water.

449
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,260
提姆？
Tim?

450
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,028
黛维娜
Davina.

451
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,033
不
Oh, no.

452
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,716
卡蜜，你还好吗？
Cami, are you all right?

453
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,252
今天吃饭了吗？
Did you eat today?

454
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,989
你一定是昏过去了
Oh, you must have fainted.

455
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,222
是啊，或许我就是神秘地
被四个女巫弄昏了
Yeah, or I got mystically
cold-cocked by four witches.

456
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,225
黛维娜在哪？
Where's Davina?

457
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,366
你朋友马赛尔知道她在这里吗？
Does your friend, Marcel,
know she's here?

458
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,000
卡蜜，我可以解释
Cami, I can explain.

459
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,929
吸血鬼？女巫？
Vampires? Witches?

460
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,370
我的哥哥，你的侄子，被女巫下了咒
My brother, your nephew,
hexed by a witch.

461
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,770
你怎么能瞒着我？
How could you not tell me?

462
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,037
这很复杂
It's complicated.

463
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,242
有很多事情你不明白
There's a lot you don't understand.

464
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,043
你对我隐瞒真相
You hid the truth from me.

465
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,584
你让我相信西恩疯了
You let me believe
that Sean was crazy,

466
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,882
我疯了
而不是告诉我真相
that I was crazy,
instead of telling me the truth.

467
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,888
我是在保护你
I was protecting you.

468
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,829
你也看到西恩的下场了
卡蜜，拜托
You saw what happened to Sean.
Cami, please!

469
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,296
离我远点
Get the hell away from me.

470
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,595
你和这个城市里其他的怪物一样坏
You are every bit as bad
as the other monsters in this city.

471
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,238
是不是非常尴尬呢？
Isn't this monumentally awkward?

472
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,183
蕾贝卡，你在哪？
Rebekah, where are you?

473
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,585
我和黛维娜在一起，她快死了
都是因为你的背叛
I'm with Davina, and
she's dying because of your treachery.

474
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,987
出于对马赛尔的尊重，我曾试着跟她谈
Well, I tried to talk to her,
out of respect for Marcel,

475
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,492
但她明确表示她不是我们的朋友
but she made it quite clear
she is not our friend.

476
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,527
你若觉得她是你的朋友，我向你道歉
My apologies if you
thought she was yours.

477
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,290
告诉我要怎么救她
Just tell me how to cure her.

478
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,933
吸血鬼的血没有用
Vampire blood isn't working.

479
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,796
对，不会有用的
No. It wouldn't.

480
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,407
我魅惑提姆给她喝下的毒药
是非常有效的
You see, the poison I compelled
Timothy to feed her is quite potent.

481
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,474
她死只是早晚的问题了
It's just a matter of time for her.

482
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,771
是他们俩，你这个残忍的混蛋
For both of them,
you diabolical bastard.

483
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,538
他们还是孩子
They're children.

484
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,410
我们本来可以公平地和她做交易
We could've dealt with her fairly.

485
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,949
对于威胁我们的人，不用谈什么交易
There is no dealing with
those who threaten us.

486
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,952
黛维娜与我对立的那一刻开始
命运就已定
Davina sealed her fate
when she stood against me.

487
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,386
这是她的选择，不是我的
This was her choice, not mine.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)

488
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,926
别这样
(CHUCKLlNG)
Oh, come on.

489
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,198
你们指责我的恶臭真是势不可档
The stench of your judgment
is overwhelming.

490
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,434
需要我提醒你们
黛维娜刚打败了我们吗？
Need I remind you that
Davina just bested the lot of us?

491
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,669
我只是做了该做的
I did what had to be done.

492
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,543
别担心，以利亚
Don't worry, Elijah.

493
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,513
我还是一如既往可被挽救
I remain as redeemable as ever.

494
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,414
所以你魅惑那个男孩去给黛维娜下毒
So you compelled that boy
to poison Davina

495
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,452
都不问问我和马赛尔
without consulting Marcel or myself.

496
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,591
你知道最糟糕的问题是什么吗？
You know what the worst part is?

497
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,249
是你太容易被看穿了
It's that you're so predictable,

498
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,487
我不得不与你哥哥结盟
我根本不喜欢他
I had to make an alliance with your
brother, who I don't even like.

499
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,202
听你的口气
你似乎有什么事想跟我说
Judging by your expression,
you have something you'd like to share.

500
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,999
你说对了
Damn straight, I do.

501
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,735
基兰稍早打了电话给我
就在莎宾和其他女巫
I got a call from Kieran earlier,
right after Sabine and some witches

502
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,072
对黛维娜下手之后
almost got their hands on Davina first.

503
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,314
你好啊
Oh, hello.

504
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,244
让我猜猜，保护咒吗？
Let me guess, protection spell?

505
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,357
你觉得我会白白浪费能施魔法的一天
什么都不做吗？
You think I'd let a day where witches
can do magic pass by without one?

506
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,725
她们本该都这么做的
They all should've done the same.

507
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,293
是啊
Yeah.

508
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,000
你违反了我的规矩，莎宾
我猜你的保护咒
You broke one of my rules, Sabine,
and I'm guessing that spell of yours

509
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,106
应该是一次性的吧
is probably a one-time deal.

510
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,305
我给你两个选择
I'll give you two choices.

511
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:43,174
你可以立刻和你天人永隔的朋友相见
An immediate reunion
with your dearly departed friends,

512
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,214
也可以为我的一个小女巫朋友
施同样的保护咒
or you can do that same spell
for a young witch friend of mine.

513
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,684
你大概知道我在说谁
Yeah, you probably know
which one I'm talking about.

514
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,819
所以你声称去看夜行者时
So, when you slipped away to
allegedly check on your Nightwalkers,

515
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,487
其实是在与一名女巫共谋
you were, in fact,
colluding with a witch.

516
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,524
很聪明嘛
Very clever.

517
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,260
我应该感到自豪
I suppose I should be proud.

518
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:10,396
我是想确保万无一失
I just wanted to make sure
I had a failsafe just in case,

519
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,442
正如以利亚所料，你开始露出本性
as Elijah expected,
you started acting like you.

520
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,511
但这次你选择了与女巫结盟
Except that now you've
involved the witches,

521
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,944
而据我所知
女巫一直是我们的敌人
who, last time I checked,
were enemy to us all,

522
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,914
对于我们的家人和一切都是威胁
to everything we have,
and to our family.

523
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,677
黛维娜就是马赛尔的家人，尼克劳斯
Davina is Marcel's family, Niklaus,

524
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,687
但你居然想取她性命
难道你忘了这一点吗？
or did that somehow slip your mind
as you tried to take her life?

525
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,221
打给蕾贝卡
You will call Rebekah.

526
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,329
告诉她黛维娜会恢复
You'll tell her that Davina will recover.

527
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,034
可惜那个男孩活不了了
I do wish the same could be said
for that boy.

528
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,816
提姆
Tim.

529
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,154
提姆，提姆
Tim? Tim.

530
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,958
提姆，提姆，醒醒
Tim, wake up.

531
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,826
提姆，快醒醒
Tim, please wake up.

532
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,297
睁开眼睛
Open your eyes.

533
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,766
不要啊，不要
No, no.

534
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,929
快醒来
Please wake up.

535
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,009
别丢下我一个人
Please don't leave me alone.

536
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,059
她还好吗？
Is she okay?

537
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,496
她情绪崩溃，疲惫不堪
She's devastated and exhausted.

538
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,972
她的房间在哪里？
Where's her room?

539
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,405
不用，我来就行
No, I got her.

540
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,409
交给我吧
I got her.

541
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,371
有人说，这是男人的世界
HAYLEY: It is said that
this is a man's world.

542
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,141
有时候的确是这样
And sometimes it is.

543
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,760
虽然很多木匣女孩被解救
但那毕竟是有限的
For every Casket Girl that was saved,
countless others were not.

544
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,261
她永远不会再信任我了
She'll never trust me again.

545
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,763
也许吧
Perhaps.

546
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,269
但你永远不能放弃重新争取她的信任
You must never surrender
the fight to reclaim that trust.

547
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,773
但女人其实比世人想像的更坚韧
HAYLEY: But women are more
resilient than given credit for.

548
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,033
这些画，是什么？
These drawings, what are they?

549
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,810
她在阁楼时就一直画这些
She drew those the whole time
she was in the attic,

550
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,781
她感受到魔法时，画出来的就不一样
said they're different than what
she draws when she senses magic.

551
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,317
这些，她称之为邪恶
These ones, she called them evil.

552
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,124
而有些女人呢
HAYLEY: And some women,
well...

553
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,492
这么说吧，曾欺压她们的人最好小心点
Let's just say, their oppressors
had better watch out.

554
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,843
见到我很惊讶吗？
Surprised to see me?

555
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,174
毕竟你曾魅惑我让我离开
After all, you did
compel me to leave town.

556
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,276
你记得了
You remember.

557
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,282
这都是解除魅惑的功劳
Chalk one up for de-compulsion.

558
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,943
虽然痛得要死，不过很值得
Hurts like hell, but it's worth it.

559
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,215
让我明白了为什么我想留下来
Made me realize exactly
why I want to stick around.

560
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,886
对了，克劳斯，如果你再敢
伤害戴维娜和小约
And Klaus, if you hurt
Davina or Josh in any way,

561
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,257
我会向全世界揭发你
I'll expose you to the world.

562
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,831
你就可以跟法语区吻别了
And then, you can kiss
the French Quarter goodbye.

563
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,596
永别
Forever.

564
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,659
晚安了
Have a nice night.

565
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,440
我也很坚韧
HAYLEY: I, too, am resilient.

566
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,702
我受够了被压迫
And I'm tired of being oppressed.

567
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,904
一千年来，我哥哥为了他想要的东西
不择手段
For a thousand years, my brother has
taken what he wants,

568
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,915
不计后果
in whatever way he wants,
regardless of the consequences.

569
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:18,146
马赛尔似乎已经默许
而以利亚也一直陪伴在他身旁
Marcel seems determined to allow it,
and Elijah stands right by his side

570
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,688
徒劳地等待着他某一天会改变
futilely awaiting
the day that he'll change.

571
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,722
男人很混蛋
So, men suck.

572
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,325
你想要我怎么做？
What do you want me to do about it?

573
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,998
虽然你警告过马赛尔
Despite your dire warnings to Marcel,

574
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,366
但他似乎无法放弃我哥哥
he just can't seem to quit my brother.

575
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,235
他们肩并肩
The two of them stand side by side,

576
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,037
统治着这个城市
却留你在这里腐烂
ruling this city
whilst you're left in here to rot.

577
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,275
我希望你帮我夺回纽奥良
I want you to help me take
New Orleans right out from

578
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,781
让他们眼睁睁看着
under all of their noses.

579
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,187
而且我有一个秘密武器
And I have something
they won't see coming,

580
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,051
一个内应
someone on the inside.

581
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,626
她自己也是个很坚韧的女孩
She's quite the resilient girl herself.

582
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,383
你还好吗？
You okay?

583
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,021
我现在好多了
I'm better now.

584
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,820
你今天过得如何？
How was your day?

585
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,459
棒极了
Killer.

586
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,495
这些画是什么？
What's with the artwork?

587
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,602
黛维娜的素描
Uh... Davina's sketches.

588
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:44,033
不知道是不是代表着什么预兆
I wonder if they represent
some kind of premonition.

589
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,104
好了
Okay.

590
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,470
似乎在暗示什么即将到来
They seem to suggest
something is coming.

591
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,350
似乎是凶兆
Something sinister.

592
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,601
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

593
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,006
那不是…
Isn't that...?

594
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,137
你好，莎莉丝特
Hello, Celeste.

595
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,694
快点，苏菲，快接电话
Come on, Sophie, pick up.

596
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,466
快点接啊
Pick up.

597
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:55,445
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
