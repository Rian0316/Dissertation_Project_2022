1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:05,671
Leonard, what time does
your mom's plane get in?

2
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,039
         I don't know--
  some time tomorrow morning.

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,941
Don't you want
to know for sure?

4
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,643
No need to. As soon as she flies
into California airspace,

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,512
         I'll feel a disturbance
                   in the Force.

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,282
          It's so nice
both of your moms are coming in

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,951
 to see you guys get an award.

8
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:22,121
  Well, my mother's been there
    for every honor I've won

9
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,956
since I beat out my twin sister

10
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,557
        for the "did it
     on the potty" trophy.

11
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,694
      How does this look?

12
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,030
Aw, it's so nice.
She's gonna love it.

13
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,364
   Sure, his mom gets roses.

14
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,665
       When I want them,

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,368
     they're a "bouquet of
    severed plant genitals."

16
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,904
 You act like I didn't get you

17
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,240
       that mushroom log
      on Valentine's Day.

18
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,808
          He's right.

19
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,245
 Roses die, but a moist rotting
  log will pump out mushrooms

20
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,914
for two or three magical years.

21
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,916
You know,
your mom's never been

22
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,485
too thrilled
with our relationship.

23
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,053
Maybe I should get her something
so she warms up to me.

24
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,721
                If you could run
              out and get a PhD,

25
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,090
                 that might make
                   her like you.

26
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,527
Really?
It didn't work for you.

27
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,028
          Do you think
    the moms will get along?

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,830
               Uh, I don't know.
       They're pretty different.

29
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,698
 Maybe they'll be best friends.

30
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,701
       One of them is brilliant,
        one is sweet and simple.

31
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,571
                 Sound familiar?

40

 Shelly, I'm so proud of you and
 Leonard for getting this award.

41
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,802
     Oh, thank you, Mother.

42
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,804
     I tried to read your paper,
            but it was very hard

43
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,106
           for me to understand.

44
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,108
Oh, it's quite
straightforward, actually.

45
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,643
It describes a new model
of the universe

46
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,079
that conceptualizes it
as the surface

47
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,647
of an n-dimensional
superfluid.

48
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:56,648
                    Interesting.

49
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,983
           You can believe that,

50
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:02,154
     but God filling an ark with
 animals two-by-two is nonsense.

51
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:08,060
What did they feed
the lions, Mother?

52
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:12,831
          The floating bodies of
     drowned sinners, of course.

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,638
Listen, Leonard's mom is
a renowned psychiatrist

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,173
and woman of science.

55
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,009
Can you please keep
the Bible babble to yourself

56
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,410
while she's here?

57
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,179
          Are you ashamed of me?

58
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,449
Of course not.
I love you.

59
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:34,653
I'm just embarrassed by the
things you believe, do and say.

60
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,259
          Well, I love you, too.

61
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,395
                  My little bowl
                   of lion chow.

62
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,134
So, have you and Penny
set a wedding date?

63
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,537
               No, we're kind of
                 taking it slow.

64
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,205
I see.

65
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,976
What does that mean?

66
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,046
     You've been on and off with
      this woman for seven years

67
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,548
   and engaged for one year.

68
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,150
       One has to wonder
     if there's a problem.

69
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,287
         Are you having
   satisfactory intercourse?

70
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,523
          Yes, Mother.

71
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:17,229
              Only satisfactory.
                          I see.

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
             I change my answer.

73
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,801
                It-it's amazing.
                       It's hot.

74
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,371
          We can barely keep our
           hands off each other.

75
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,807
Seems odd to try
and impress your mother

76
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,211
                       with your
                 sexual prowess.

77
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:36,381
   But then, you always did have
that unresolved Oedipal complex.

78
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,383
See, this right here,
what you're doing,

79
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,220
can you please not do that
around Sheldon's mom?

80
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,590
          Why? Are you attracted
                    to her, too?

81
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,191
                  Of course not.

82
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,027
         She's-she's just a very
     sweet and God-fearing lady,

83
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,196
              and you have to be
      respectful of her beliefs.

84
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,598
Leonard, I'm an adult.

85
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,033
I know how to conduct myself
around people

86
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,835
from different
walks of life.

87
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:57,836
           Thank you.

88
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:58,837
    Where is she from again?

89
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,240
          East Texas.
              Ugh.

90
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,612
           Hey, look who's here.

91
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:10,582
      Oh, Dr. Hofstadter,
 it's so good to see you again.

92
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,783
           Likewise.

93
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,353
       I read your paper;
    it was very impressive.

94
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,220
                  Oh, thank you.

95
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,222
We just spent
two hours in traffic.

96
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:20,459
Did you think to mention to me
that you liked our paper?

97
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,894
            Of course I did, but
             it's a mother's job

98
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,464
        to make sure her child's
    self-esteem is not dependent

99
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,665
           on anyone's approval.

100
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,303
That's so sweet,
you think I have self-esteem.

101
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:35,240
   Dr. Hofstadter, I want you
    to meet my mother, Mary.

102
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,475
So nice to meet you.

103
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,644
          Nice to meet you, too.
            How was your flight?

104
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,312
Very pleasant. And yours?

105
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,147
                  Lovely. Almost
                 as if someone--

106
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,816
            not saying who-- was
        watching over the plane.

107
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,288
     You're kidding, right?

108
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,659
Subtle, Mom,
real subtle.

109
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,732
            Stuart.

110
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,269
            Morning.

111
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,004
     We talked about this.

112
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,172
I don't mind you
still living here,

113
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,740
but we got to have
some rules.

114
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,876
 And rule number one is pants.

115
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,647
           Hey, hey.
        (clears throat)

116
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,186
                You must be very
              proud of your son.

117
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,354
            Oh, yes.

118
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:26,224
       He recently argued a case
       before the Supreme Court.

119
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,095
            He did?

120
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:34,099
          Oh, you mean this son.

121
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:37,469
                       Uh, sure,
                  he's terrific.

122
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,872
  Uh, Beverly, would you like
  to see the math I worked out

123
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,374
   to support our hypothesis?

124
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,809
Uh, you mean,
<i>my</i> hypothesis.

125
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,377
I hypothesized it
all by myself.

126
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,813
                Calm down, dear.

127
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,181
              Mary, I'm curious.

128
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,215
When did you
first realize

129
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,684
          that your son had such
              a remarkable mind?

130
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,686
      Ooh, good question.

131
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,422
  Everyone loves stories about
  Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.

132
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,226
   Well, I would have to say
         when he was 13

133
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,329
  and tried to build a nuclear
   reactor in the tool shed.

134
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,198
    Ooh, this is a good one.

135
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,735
   Now, the first thing you have
         to know about Shelly is

136
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,203
ever since he was a little boy,

137
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,773
    he was always concerned
 with the well-being of others.

138
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,478
      And he didn't think
        that it was fair

139
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
       for people to pay
        for electricity,

140
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,549
     so he was gonna power
   the entire town for free.

141
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,984
(stammers)
Tell her about the uranium!

142
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,252
Tell her about
the uranium.

143
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,087
                       Oh, well!

144
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,255
     Oh, this is adorable.

145
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,692
    When he arranged to get
   some yellowcake from Chad,

146
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,094
    I thought he was talking
         about Twinkies

147
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,829
    from one of his friends.

148
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,830
                           Yeah.

149
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,232
                   But I wasn't.

150
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,001
                 'Cause I didn't
               have any friends.

151
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,603
           (laughs):
              No.

152
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,939
     It turns out that this
  little scallywag was trying

153
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,542
      to use my Visa card
         to buy uranium

154
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:54,579
    from an African warlord
    in the country of Chad!

155
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,917
      Sounds like Sheldon
         was a handful.

156
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,519
     Oh, he was a handful.

157
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,422
                I was a handful.

158
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,524
         You still are.

159
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,130
Uh, Mom, hey,
tell Mary the story

160
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,733
about how I made
a Van de Graaff generator

161
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,468
out of our vacuum cleaner.

162
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,536
                      All right.

163
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,338
                    He broke the
                 vacuum cleaner.

164
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,342
   (video game sound effects
            playing)

165
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,314
I mean, for a while,
everything was vampires.

166
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,916
Now it's all zombies.

167
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,552
I wonder what the next
monster fad will be.

168
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,154
           We haven't had a good
       invisible man in a while.

169
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,890
 Clearly, you've never seen me
    try to talk to a woman.

170
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,327
                           Guys.

171
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,729
 In the time you've been sitting
       here playing video games,

172
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,731
     I got the car washed,
  picked up cleaning supplies

173
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,099
     and went to the bank.

174
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,836
        I put on pants.

175
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,904
                       Kiss-ass.

176
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,076
         Okay, I don't know when
             I became the mother

177
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,344
        to three lazy teenagers,

178
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,579
      but it stops today.

179
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,148
     You guys are cleaning
  the kitchen, top to bottom.

180
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,851
  Hey, I don't even live here.

181
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,787
 Yes or no, do you have clothes
    in my laundry right now?

182
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,223
             I do.

183
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,592
     And some of it's wool,

184
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,494
    so dry flat if possible.

185
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,499
    Oh, and here's a picture
        of me receiving

186
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,200
 my bachelor of science degree.

187
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,469
You don't look
very happy.

188
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,172
Well, I had just begun puberty.

189
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,840
                         (sighs)

190
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,109
      It was figuratively
         and literally

191
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,545
  one of the hairiest moments
          of my life.

192
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,815
  Shelly does not like change.

193
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,216
           Oh, true.

194
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,218
     But all the clenching
   in the world will not keep

195
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,354
   testicles in your abdomen.

196
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,391
          Hey, sorry,
     got caught up at work.

197
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,392
Hi, Beverly!

198
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,460
                Hello.
   (giggles)

199
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,629
                   Oh, okay.

200
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,630
(chuckles)

201
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,697
Sorry, I forgot.

202
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,299
         You remember my mother.

203
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,300
Oh, yes. Hi, Mary!

204
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,302
                 Good to see you
                    again, dear.

205
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,070
Ah, yeah, now that's
what I'm talking about.

206
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,341
So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny
     since we got engaged.

207
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,343
                Oh, yeah, let me
              show you the ring.

208
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,511
Oh, lovely.

209
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,580
Must have been
very expensive.

210
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,581
             Oh, no, not at all.

211
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,750
               No, we, uh, found
                  a place online

212
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,653
            that, uh, repurposes
             diamond drill bits.

213
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,190
  We did not. That's not true.

214
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,594
Can I speak to you alone
for a second?

215
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,929
                       Oh, sure.

216
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,931
    It came from Tiffany's.
    (chuckles)

217
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,365
    You mean the box, right?

218
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,633
Keep walking!

219
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:35,607
     Really doesn't matter to me
  how much he spent on the ring.

220
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,576
                        I think.

221
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,111
                  Did I misspeak
                 about the ring?

222
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,080
Yes, and we'll get
back to that.

223
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,915
But, uh, even with
your mother here,

224
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,719
    you are deliberately hogging
  all the attention from my mom.

225
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,454
    You're like one of those
       elephant seal pups

226
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,123
      that steals the milk
       from two mothers!

227
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,526
          Do you mean
     what marine biologists

228
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:57,128
  refer to as "super weaning"?

229
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,831
  Yes, you are a super weaner!

230
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,103
Well, now I have to correct you.

231
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,939
           A-As a bit
   of an elephant seal buff,

232
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,608
the more accurate
comparison

233
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,710
 would be when two mother seals

234
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,878
         actively seek
    to nourish the same pup.

235
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,114
     So I believe the term
       you're looking for

236
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,884
  is a double mother suckler.

237
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,120
      Yeah, you're right.

238
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,822
        That is the term
        I'm looking for.

239
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:27,192
     You are a dirty double
        mother suckler!

240
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,163
Okay, well, now that we have the
 terminology straightened out.

241
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,299
         How dare you!

242
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,469
      We're not in a rush.

243
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,237
           We'll set a date when
              the time is right.

244
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,739
  It doesn't matter, sweetie.

245
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,240
     The moment a man lays
         with a woman,

246
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,442
        they are married
    in the eyes of the Lord.

247
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,577
   Uch.

248
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,617
                          "Uch"?

249
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,419
   The bible is "uch" to you?

250
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,520
No, I'm sorry.

251
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,821
That was inappropriate.

252
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,457
As a psychiatrist,
I know how important

253
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,660
people's superstitions
can be to them.

254
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,464
        You want to talk
      about superstitions?

255
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,366
        Sheldon sent me
     the books you wrote--

256
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,669
       all that nonsense
    about superegos and ids.

257
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,339
     What bull dropped that
       on the barn floor?

258
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,208
   His name is Sigmund Freud.

259
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,510
              Hey, look at that!

260
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,713
             You both believe in
            Jewish bearded guys.

261
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,715
       Stay out of this.

262
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,684
                         Mm-hmm.

263
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,719
    At least the bearded man
       that I believe in

264
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,988
 preaches love and compassion.

265
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,389
                       All yours
                  talks about is

266
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,824
   why you hold in your poop

267
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,794
     and want to crawl back
       inside your mama.

268
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,998
It's fascinating.

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,567
How can someone
as enlightened as Sheldon

270
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,737
come from someone like you?

271
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,305
       I know the answer.

272
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,573
   You're not gonna like it.

273
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,909
Try me.

274
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,411
When I was pregnant with Shelly,
    I was driving to church,

275
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,713
               and I was praying
                     to the Lord

276
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:58,883
    to give me a son smarter
    than his dumb-ass daddy.

277
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,154
       And I looked over
  and I saw a Jesus bobblehead

278
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,491
    in the Subaru next to me
          nodding yes.

279
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,233
 What is that supposed to mean?

280
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,437
  It means... I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

281
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,605
     Well, do it some more.

282
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,908
      Maybe you can knock
   some sense into yourself.

283
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,277
          Why don't we all stops
               hitting ourselves

284
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,946
        and talk about something
                 safe, you know,

285
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:32,350
          like shoes or how cute
      little Chinese babies are.

286
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,852
It is not my fault
that your mother likes me

287
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,720
better than she likes you!
     Oh, don't flatter yourself!

288
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,757
      She likes everybody
   better than she likes me!

289
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,931
    How old is this Jell-O?

290
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:51,002
      Well, it's carrots,
       so gonna say very.

291
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,572
   Sorry we have to do this.

292
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,274
    Bernadette's not wrong.

293
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,143
She does work hard around here.

294
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,544
 Yeah, maybe it's a good thing

295
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,246
          if she stops
      babying you so much.

296
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,381
      She doesn't baby me.

297
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,884
    I saw her pull you home
          in a wagon.

298
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,153
     For your information,

299
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,990
       I twisted my ankle
  chasing the ice cream truck.

300
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,726
   Face it, dude, Bernadette
    treats you the same way

301
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,996
 your mother used to, and that
was not a healthy relationship.

302
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,800
         You're right.
           (chuckles)

303
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,101
It's time for me

304
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:27,305
      to act like an adult
       in this marriage.

305
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,543
Starting with my husbandly duty
    of taking out the trash.

306
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,552
Bernie, I made a mess!

307
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,691
I'm terribly sorry
that I upset your mother.

308
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,526
             Oh, it's all right.
             She'll forgive you.

309
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,663
                   She has to or
               she goes to hell.

310
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,967
I can't help but notice

311
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,870
how her unconditional
love for you

312
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:02,507
is diametrically opposed
to my own parenting strategies.

313
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,476
                 Well, you doled
                   out affection

314
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,213
                 as a reward for
                   achievement--

315
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,515
                 a proven way to
                  raise a child.

316
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,051
                 Or train a rat.

317
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,953
But look how well
you turned out.

318
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:19,457
I'd feign modesty at this point,
       but who would believe me?

319
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,159
                 Still, you need
                     to consider

320
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,728
        how successful Leonard's
         brother and sister are.

321
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,730
I suppose.

322
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,834
     While my brother and sister
     are mouth-breathing idiots.

323
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,804
Do you suppose
you would've flourished more

324
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,305
in a reward-based environment?

325
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,708
                        Perhaps.

326
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,677
    But my mom made me spaghetti
        with chopped-up hot dogs

327
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,413
              whenever I wanted,
                   so who cares?

328
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,319
  Not once did my mother ever
 give me any love or affection

329
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,421
          for just being myself;
        I always had to earn it.

330
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,522
                    Oh, Leonard,

331
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,992
     I'm sure she loves you
           very much.

332
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,595
  In her own cold godless way.

333
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:01,432
Yeah, and you certainly don't
have to earn my love.

334
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,667
                      Thank you.

335
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,935
Of course,
you already knew that

336
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:07,872
when you bought me
this princess-cut drill bit.

337
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,941
          That's not what it is.

338
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,776
I know, I know.

339
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,012
(imitates drill buzzing)

340
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,781
    When your mom gets back,
         I'm gonna need

341
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,917
    to apologize for the way
        I spoke to her.

342
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,885
Well, come on now,
she did kind of start it.

343
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,721
Doesn't matter; a good Christian
would've turned the other cheek.

344
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,889
              On the other hand,

345
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,659
          a good Texan
    would've shot her, so...

346
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,097
         I just kind of
     split the difference.

347
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,134
     Hey, who's in the mood
  for spaghetti and hot dogs?

348
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,568
                         Oh, me!
Yeah, me, too!

349
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,637
                      Coming up.

350
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,807
                  I don't really
              feel I deserve it.

351
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,312
                  That was a big
                    sticky mess,

352
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,080
    but... I think I got it.

353
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,148
          Looks good.
                           Yeah.

354
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,050
         Look at that.

355
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,885
       You cleaned it up
        all by yourself.

356
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,088
      Yes, I cleaned it up
         all by myself.

357
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,890
     Honestly, I don't know
    why you complain so...

358
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,226
 Okay, maybe I missed one spot.

359
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,868
          Just leave.

360
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,440
          I'm so glad
    that you and I were able

361
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,475
            to bury the hatchet.
Me, too.

362
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,811
And I respect your right
to your beliefs.

363
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,980
                      And I will
                   pray for you.

364
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,417
    Okay, Mom, let's get you
       back to your hotel

365
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,852
       before anyone says
         anything else.

366
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,187
BEVERLY:
One moment.

367
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,956
       There's something
     I need to say to you.

368
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,692
  Oh, really? That's too bad.

369
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,296
       Leonard, I always
  made you earn my affection,

370
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,831
but today I realize

371
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,700
 that there's more than one way
       to raise a child.

372
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,870
              I taught her that!

373
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,372
BEVERLY:
Therefore, I would like

374
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:51,109
   to initiate a new protocol
          wherein I...

375
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,445
           shower you
    with unconditional love.

376
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,981
              Wow.

377
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,349
     When does that start?

378
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,386
           So needy.

379
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,059
         Come to Mommy.

380
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,396
            It's okay, go ahead.

381
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,973
          Oh, my son.

382
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,910
                  Oh, my mother.

383
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,212
          Oh, my God.
