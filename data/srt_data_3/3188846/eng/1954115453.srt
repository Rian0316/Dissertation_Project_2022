1
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:03,529
Previously
on "The Originals"...

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,629
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,301
Our community
is under attack.

4
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:10,102
Resurrected witches
with vast power?

5
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:11,261
It's the harvest.

6
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,430
Four girls were
meant to die

7
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:14,707
and be reborn.

8
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,709
Someone jacked
that power.

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,544
I believe that when
you love someone

10
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,713
and that person
loves you in return,

11
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:22,147
you're uniquely
vulnerable.

12
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:24,116
Celeste, she died
because of me.

13
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:25,651
I'd appreciate it if you'd
call me by my real name...

14
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,253
Celeste.

15
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:28,921
What about Hayley?

16
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,089
None of my treachery
will harm this family

17
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,791
as much as your
feelings for her.

18
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,526
This blade contains

19
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:35,126
all the power I harvested
from the vampires.

20
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:36,594
It will do
things worse than death.

21
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,705
And are you ready
for the final offering?

22
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,369
Someone help me.

23
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:22,174
Thank you all for coming.

24
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,842
It means more
than I can tell you.

25
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:28,013
We gather today
for the first public service

26
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:30,182
of our newly reopened
church.

27
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:32,968
St. Anne's can finally
once again be the heart

28
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,054
of our community,
where we can congregate

29
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,555
as a people united.

30
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:42,326
Here, this hour, we come
together to praise God

31
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:43,770
and give thanks.

32
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:49,967
The events that took place
at our church were tragic.

33
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:51,669
Problem?

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,904
No.

35
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,406
Then pay attention.

36
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:56,508
We're meant to seem
like devoted parishioners.

37
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,476
...And it is
that hope in our hearts

38
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:03,315
and with the help of many
benefactors that allows us

39
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:05,208
to be here today.

40
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,878
So we gather
with renewed spirit

41
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,923
made stronger, committed
to the ideals of peace

42
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,159
and love. Amen.

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,360
Amen.

44
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:19,229
Each tomb
is well cared for.

45
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,733
Families honor their dead
with displays of affection

46
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,201
and respect...

47
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:25,035
Is someone there?

48
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:27,038
This tomb belongs to
the Deveraux family,

49
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,773
known throughout the quarter
for their strong connection

50
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,008
to witchcraft.

51
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:31,876
Please help me!

52
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:35,145
And if you look close,
these fresh bricks

53
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:36,714
tell us someone
in the family

54
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:37,915
has recently fallen.

55
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:43,521
Let me out!

56
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:00,931
Hello, Monique.

57
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,894
Welcome back to
the land of the living.

59
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,875
What is it?
What's going on?

60
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,797
It's a miracle.

61
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,554
Monique?

62
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,102
Ohh!

63
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,660
Lovely sermon
this morning, father.

64
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:58,295
Quite inspirational.

65
00:03:58,296 --> 00:03:59,830
I wasn't
expecting you to join us.

66
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,232
Oh, we were hoping for some
word from your human sources

67
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,119
on the recent Haitian
invasion.

68
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,969
My guys have their
ears to the ground.

69
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,238
And no one has seen
or heard any sign

70
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,139
of whatever
his name is.

71
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,808
He's called Papa Tunde.

72
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:12,976
And right now, he's
wandering the corridor

73
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:14,311
with the power
he absorbed

74
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,846
from every soul I had
buried in the garden.

75
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,080
So you might want
to put your ear

76
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:18,281
a little closer
to the ground.

77
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,651
Or I could
steer clear

78
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:22,785
of whatever war
is brewing

79
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:24,288
between your kind
and his

80
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,023
before I
find myself in...

81
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,024
I wanted to congratulate you
on getting the church

82
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,259
up and running.

83
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,861
I can see this is
a bad time.

84
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:32,063
Nice to see you, Marcel.

85
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,297
Cami.

86
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,502
Well, don't look at me.

87
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:40,069
I tried to send her away.

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,140
Yes, Diego, what
do you have for me?

89
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:48,478
Uh, we got
a special delivery.

90
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,499
Would you
care to elaborate?

91
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,718
Either our witch
problems are over

92
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:57,821
or they're just
getting started.

93
00:04:57,822 --> 00:05:00,390
Marcel.

94
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:01,593
Father.

95
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,761
God be with you.

96
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,498
Thank you.
God be with you.

97
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,501
Thank you.
God be with y...

98
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:14,737
Oh, I doubt that, but I
do appreciate the thought.

99
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:16,038
Bastiana.

100
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,075
Toursion fou,
mort de l'espirit.

101
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,412
Give your nephew Sean
my regards

102
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,746
when you see him in hell.

103
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:35,669
Can I get you
anything, brother?

104
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,394
A magnifying glass,
a pipe perhaps?

105
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:39,861
You have a theory
that you'd like

106
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:41,164
to share with us,
Niklaus?

107
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:42,665
Back in the day,
the witches wanted

108
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,666
to send a threat, they'd
just kill a chicken

109
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,200
and leave it
on your doorstep.

110
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,803
It's rather a large
and ominous chicken,

111
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,136
wouldn't you say?

112
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:49,572
Papa Tunde defeated

113
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:51,439
Rebekah with ease,

114
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,942
almost got the two of us
as well.

115
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:56,111
If he was supposed to be
their prize fighter,

116
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:57,780
why leave him for dead
in our front yard?

117
00:05:57,781 --> 00:05:59,248
Well, don't you all
look cheery.

118
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,517
Listen to this...

119
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:02,752
A girl
literally exploded

120
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:04,052
from a grave today
as Sabine was giving

121
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,321
her tour of the city
of the dead.

122
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,723
It was Monique Deveraux.

123
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:10,425
What?

124
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,560
The tourists thought it
was part of the show,

125
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:12,895
but the witches are
celebrating

126
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,064
like it's some kind of
bloody miracle.

127
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:16,799
Maybe it is. They
think that all hope is lost,

128
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,135
but now suddenly a harvest
girl is resurrected.

129
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:21,070
This is how we're gonna
get Davina back...

130
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:23,138
Kill the witch who took
her place.

131
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,774
I have a theory about
who one of them could be...

132
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:29,644
Celeste. I mean,
it's got to be.

133
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:31,380
Davina was trying to tell us.

134
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,934
She was drawing
pictures of Celeste.

135
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,438
She was warning us that
a great evil was coming.

136
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:41,556
First Papa Tunde
returns to settle old scores.

137
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:43,892
Now your murdered
lover is back.

138
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:46,795
This isn't witches
attacking vampires.

139
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:49,826
They're declaring
war on us.

140
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,972
It's not too early
for scotch, is it,

141
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:59,208
with all the witches'
shenanigans

142
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,610
and subterfuge afoot.

143
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:03,679
It is entirely too
early if one intends

144
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,147
to drive, yes.

145
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,682
Funny. I don't have
any plans to go anywhere.

146
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:10,013
She's not safe here.

147
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:13,655
You have to take Hayley
to the plantation house

148
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:15,356
until this is over.

149
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:16,825
Are you worried about Hayley

150
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:18,827
or whether or not
you can trust me?

151
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:21,063
It's precisely
because I trust you

152
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,098
that I'm asking you
to do this.

153
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,633
Here's a novel idea...

154
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,434
Why don't you let Hayley
decide for herself?

155
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:29,671
Why are you
dictating her fate?

156
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:31,206
You know why.

157
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:33,141
Then perhaps you should
take her yourself.

158
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:35,076
Well, then that would
make me the very

159
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,011
hypocrite that you've
accused me of being.

160
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:40,482
Rebekah, I cannot
legislate my feelings.

161
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:43,250
My actions, however...

162
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:47,922
So would you kindly
do this for me?

163
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:52,827
You know the mama wolf
loves to be told

164
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,696
what to do.

165
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:57,699
She's not gonna like it,

166
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,666
but I will do it for you...

167
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,604
If only to end
this silly quarrel

168
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:04,484
between the two of us.

169
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:15,116
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

170
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:16,583
Listen, everybody's
running off, looking

171
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,086
for resurrected witches.

172
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:20,722
Meanwhile, I think I saw
one at the church...

173
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:22,123
Genevieve.

174
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,558
What?

175
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,993
I can't be sure.

176
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:26,294
I only caught her out of
the corner of my eye.

177
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:27,728
Been with Klaus since.

178
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,031
But it looked like her.

179
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:32,567
And you and I both know
she would have a reason

180
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,067
to want to be back.

181
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,137
A lot of unfinished
business,

182
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:39,102
a lot of secrets that you
and I don't want getting out.

183
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:43,778
I have to take Hayley
to the plantation.

184
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:47,280
You need to find
Genevieve and end this.

185
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,446
End it like we did
the last time.

186
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,957
Tea, please.

187
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,071
I'm busy.

188
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,540
Cami, just hear me out.

189
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,308
You know, I came to your
reopening because I

190
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:15,542
wanted to try
and make amends.

191
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:17,778
And then I see you
talking with Klaus

192
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,313
out in the open, like
it's business as usual

193
00:09:20,314 --> 00:09:21,314
in the quarter.

194
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:22,916
It is business as usual.

195
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,585
For the past 3 centuries,

196
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:26,153
the O'Connells have always
tried to keep the peace.

197
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:27,988
Save me
the family history.

198
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:30,089
It's all lies
on top of lies.

199
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,780
Cami, p... pour me a drink.

200
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,742
I have to tell you
something.

201
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:51,145
Uncle Kieran,
what's wrong?

202
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,279
I'm in trouble.

203
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,184
What happened to your
brother Sean is

204
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:59,152
about to start
happening to me.

205
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:00,934
What?

206
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:04,854
Look, uh...

207
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:10,329
Look, uh,
I've been hexed.

208
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:14,500
And I don't know
how long I have.

209
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,403
Wait.
I know some people.

210
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:19,005
There has to be some
sort of... I don't know...

211
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:20,439
Antidote or...

212
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,844
Cami, I need you
to promise me one thing,

213
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,479
that when it gets bad,

214
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,415
I need you to be as far
away from me as possible.

215
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,218
No. No.

216
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,253
There has to be
some sort of way.

217
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:35,021
Of course there is.

218
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:37,456
If you want to save
your Uncle's life,

219
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:42,261
all you have to do
is take this...

220
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:45,436
And make sure it ends up
in Klaus Mikaelson's heart.

221
00:10:58,142 --> 00:10:59,643
I thought I was
gonna have to drag you

222
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:02,013
to the plantation
kicking and screaming.

223
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:03,548
Yeah. Well, we all just want
to protect me and the baby,

224
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:04,782
right?

225
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:06,550
Hey. I'm on your side,
remember?

226
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:08,501
So what gives?

227
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,889
Tonight's a full moon,
Rebekah.

228
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,058
So what? You're preggers.
You can't turn.

229
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:16,227
Yes. But I wanted
to invite

230
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,794
a few people over.

231
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,396
Of course.

232
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:21,265
Every red-blooded
American werewolf

233
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,267
will be a bundle of fur
and sharp teeth tonight

234
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,235
whilst your cursed
crescent clan will be...

235
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:27,705
Human but only for
a few hours

236
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:29,273
and won't be again until
the next full moon.

237
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:33,311
So I asked Josh to get
a message out to Eve

238
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,745
in the bayou.

239
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:37,447
Josh isn't dead yet?
Well, good on him.

240
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:40,116
I love a nice
survival story.

241
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,085
Who the bloody hell is that?

242
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:45,371
Kegs out back,
right? Ahem.

243
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:48,826
Right.

244
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:50,194
It appears you weren't
going to wait for me

245
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,029
to grant you permission
to throw a kegger.

246
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,431
Listen, you all want me
safe, fine.

247
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:55,933
I'll do as I'm told.

248
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:58,502
I'll play damsel
in the glass tower.

249
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:00,471
But tonight's
the one night a month

250
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:02,206
that I can meet
my family.

251
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:05,058
Now, you could rat me
out, send me to my room,

252
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,345
or you
could help me throw

253
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,113
one hell of a party.

254
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,489
Elijah.

255
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,458
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

256
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,528
My family needs
an ally

257
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:26,163
among the witches,
and you've helped us

258
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:27,764
in the past.

259
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,266
Perhaps together we
can avoid

260
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,541
an unnecessary
conflict.

261
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,936
They may be willing
to make a deal

262
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:35,972
if it were with
the noble Elijah.

263
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:38,375
But there will never be
any peace as long as it

264
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:39,575
involves Klaus.

265
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,811
Is that what all this
is about?

266
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:42,345
You want my brother
out of town?

267
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,214
I'm just telling you
how they feel.

268
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:46,216
My people are scared.
They're desperate,

269
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:48,518
but they're not dumb.

270
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,352
You have a niece
on the way.

271
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:53,523
It stands to reason you'd
be willing to discuss

272
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,066
how to run him out
of the city.

273
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,360
Let's walk together.

274
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:02,998
You can take me
on one of your famous tours.

275
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,205
You should eat

276
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,639
after everything you've
been through.

277
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,709
I was dead.

278
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,979
But you're here now.

279
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,383
Aunt Sophie, what
happened to mom?

280
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:29,958
Your mother loved you
so much.

281
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,829
She had faith that she
could use magic

282
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,596
to complete the harvest

283
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:37,567
and get you back.

284
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:42,605
In the end, she sacrificed
herself for the cause,

285
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:46,367
for the witches, for you.

286
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:50,329
And do you have
her faith?

287
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:53,582
I lost my faith.

288
00:13:55,852 --> 00:14:00,088
Then I realized
that if I didn't believe,

289
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,790
I would be letting
you down.

290
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:07,929
I tried to get it back.
I tried.

291
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:12,434
Monique Deveraux.

292
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,871
Everyone in the
quarter's been talking

293
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,071
about you.

294
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:19,642
Classy.
You kill her mother

295
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:21,477
and now you've come
to threaten her?

296
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:23,812
I'm not here
to threaten anyone.

297
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:27,717
What do you want, Marcel?

298
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:28,951
There were 3 more
girls sacrificed

299
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,353
during the harvest.

300
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:31,587
I want to bring
them back.

301
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:33,621
Who are you kidding?

302
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,724
You don't care
about those girls.

303
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:38,460
You just want Davina back so
you can use her power again.

304
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,161
I just
want her alive.

305
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,923
He's telling the truth.

306
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:45,100
How do you know that?

307
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,570
I can feel it.

308
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,737
He's loyal to her.

309
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:52,391
He's here to help.

310
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,552
I got your message.

311
00:15:04,553 --> 00:15:05,620
Where's Kieran now?

312
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:09,090
In the attic resting,
praying.

313
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,362
He's gonna go crazy
and die, isn't he...

314
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,364
Just like Sean.

315
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:19,301
And we'll still be
in this stupid fight

316
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:21,703
because he lied to
me about the witches

317
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:24,606
and vampires...

318
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,307
And you.

319
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:29,777
Camille...

320
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:36,318
I can see why you hate me.

321
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:40,989
Truth be told, I have done
some dreadful things.

322
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,326
But the lies your Uncle
told were meant

323
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:45,694
to protect you.

324
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,695
He is a good man...

325
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,491
With a loyal heart.

326
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,953
And he is your family.

327
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,707
As for these witches,

328
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,775
their attack on Kieran
should be proof enough

329
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,577
they're the enemy.

330
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,746
In that we are united.

331
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,686
Klaus...

332
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,670
This is
Papa Tunde's blade.

333
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,371
A witch gave it
to me.

334
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:32,373
Said it would
cause untold pain

335
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,285
and torment,
even to an original.

336
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,145
She said if I stuck
it in your heart,

337
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,624
she would heal
Kieran.

338
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,818
And yet you chose
to reject their offer.

339
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:46,988
Maybe if I were more
like you, I could do it.

340
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:48,722
But I'm not...

341
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:50,657
A monster.

342
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:52,460
I'm not stupid.

343
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,362
If there's a war
going on,

344
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:56,229
I want to be on
the winning side.

345
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,805
Let's see what we can do
about saving your Uncle,

346
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,205
shall we?

347
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:38,474
Hello again.

348
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,565
I'm looking forward
to meeting you soon.

349
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,540
You've got to be
kidding me.

350
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,576
A vampire is
trying to reverse

351
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:11,479
a witch's hex
placed on you,

352
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,282
and it's the cup you
find sacrilegious.

353
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:27,762
Are you sure this is
going to work?

354
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:29,463
Not remotely.

355
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:31,099
But I can't attempt
to use my compulsion

356
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,401
to counter Bastiana's
curse if the good father

357
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:35,837
has vervain in his
system. Thus...

358
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:38,772
We bleed him out.

359
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:40,908
I never said this
would be pleasant.

360
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:43,122
Just do what you have to do.

361
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,398
So help me God, Marcel,
if you don't call me

362
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:06,687
back with an update,
I will kill you myself.

363
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:15,710
Oh.

364
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:17,444
I beg...

365
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:19,158
Your pardon.

366
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:25,152
I was expecting
someone furrier.

367
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:28,022
You're one of them,
aren't you?

368
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:29,756
An original.

369
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:33,626
Yes. You might want to say
that with some more respect.

370
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:38,098
I suppose you'll be
wanting Hayley.

371
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,899
Or I could just
talk to you.

372
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:43,704
I'm Oliver.

373
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:45,935
I didn't catch
your name.

374
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,409
I'm Rebekah.

375
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:53,346
Hayley, the party's here!

376
00:19:58,285 --> 00:20:01,120
You got enough power left
to find these witches?

377
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:03,222
I know the harvest
was an epic fail,

378
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:04,691
but I can still do
a locator spell.

379
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:06,994
Before I do that,

380
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:08,428
we need to make
a deal.

381
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:09,897
What deal?

382
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:11,064
If I betray these
witches, they're

383
00:20:11,065 --> 00:20:12,466
gonna come looking
for me.

384
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,868
And if I'm caught,
I'm dead.

385
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:16,068
I said I'd protect you.

386
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,604
If you
could do that,

387
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:18,805
you wouldn't need my
help in the first place.

388
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:20,040
The quarter isn't safe.

389
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,441
Vampires on one side,

390
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,143
witches on the other.

391
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:25,712
No way am I
letting Monique get

392
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,114
in the middle of that.

393
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:29,416
In order to get her out,

394
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,051
I'm gonna need money.

395
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:33,086
Do we have a deal?

396
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:37,090
Find the witches,
I'll give you anything

397
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:38,529
you could ever need.

398
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:01,613
Well, come on! You can
do better than that.

399
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:04,551
Sorry. I've got
a burdened brain tonight.

400
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:06,086
No, no, no, no.

401
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:07,487
Tonight is not
a night for burdens.

402
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:10,557
It's to celebrate.

403
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:12,592
It's to enjoy life for
the few hours that we get

404
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:14,194
to live it.

405
00:21:14,195 --> 00:21:17,230
It's to hug our friends,
our family,

406
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:20,112
and to dance our asses off.

407
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:46,759
I seriously doubt
you invited us here

408
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,527
to wait on us.

409
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:56,501
You're Hayley.
I'm Jackson.

410
00:21:58,037 --> 00:21:59,739
It's nice to see
you again.

411
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,976
You're the wolf who's
been watching me.

412
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:05,978
I got to keep
my eye on you,

413
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,213
precious cargo
and all.

414
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:09,749
Right.

415
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,851
Got to protect
the miracle baby.

416
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,953
No. That's not
what I meant.

417
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:15,620
I don't care
about the baby.

418
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:18,691
Sorry.
That came out wrong.

419
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:20,893
I mean, of course
I care.

420
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:22,228
You're a labonair.

421
00:22:22,229 --> 00:22:25,163
A baby,
it's a big deal.

422
00:22:25,164 --> 00:22:29,168
But personally, my
interest is in you.

423
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:31,803
You don't even know me.

424
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:34,807
Our parents knew
each other.

425
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:36,475
They were of
the same people

426
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:38,010
but not the same
bloodline.

427
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:40,211
Now, you know how pack
hierarchy works, right?

428
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:41,714
Everybody has their
part to play,

429
00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:45,718
and we had
our part, too.

430
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:48,219
What part was that?

431
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:52,454
You were supposed to
be my wife.

432
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,200
So this next
part of town is

433
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:02,734
one of the few areas

434
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:04,236
where any of
the original French

435
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:05,537
architecture remains.

436
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:07,806
Most of the buildings
were destroyed

437
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:09,041
in the 1700s,
when the city burned

438
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,841
for the first time.

439
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:15,880
Am I putting you
to sleep?

440
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,482
As surprising
as you might find this,

441
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,184
it's not every day
that someone asks you

442
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:21,787
to betray your own brother...

443
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:23,527
Celeste.

444
00:23:26,258 --> 00:23:28,759
How did you know?

445
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,286
As Davina was drawing
your likeness...

446
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,699
I dared to imagine
that your presence

447
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,867
was near.

448
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:37,169
And when Sophie
discovered

449
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,937
that there was no magic
in your remains,

450
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:41,506
I wondered...

451
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:44,709
Could you have possibly
cheated death by using

452
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,210
your power to place
your essence

453
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:47,812
into the body
of another?

454
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:50,512
And if so, then who?

455
00:23:52,384 --> 00:23:56,921
And then I recalled
the lovely Sabine.

456
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:59,124
Are you gonna continue
following me, Elijah?

457
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,791
Or do you want to talk?

458
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,527
You know who I am.

459
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,828
Original vampire,
always wears a suit?

460
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,797
Your visions of my
brother's child

461
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,134
precipitated the death
of the last elder

462
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:10,468
within your coven...

463
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:12,003
Tell them what you saw.

464
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,377
Ensuring that
the harvest ritual

465
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:20,944
could not
be completed...

466
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:23,013
Unless you
were to control it.

467
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:28,118
You're playing a very
long game indeed...

468
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:34,431
To what end?

469
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,542
Oh, Elijah...

470
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:55,445
My lost love...

471
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:00,207
After
all this time...

472
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:05,355
Don't you understand?

473
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,259
I died because of Klaus.

474
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,162
And even after all his
vindictive lies

475
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:14,165
about witches led to my
death, you stood by him

476
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:17,300
all because of your vow,
"always and forever."

477
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:18,701
What have you done to me?

478
00:25:18,702 --> 00:25:20,538
It's a simple
enchantment.

479
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:21,972
You needn't worry.

480
00:25:21,973 --> 00:25:24,175
I'm not here
to kill you, Elijah.

481
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:25,142
I'm here
to teach you

482
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:26,977
the error of your
ways.

483
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:28,512
"Always and forever" was

484
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:30,112
the greatest mistake
of your life.

485
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:46,044
Drink up.
It will heal your wound.

486
00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:55,762
I think you've
suffered enough.

487
00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:02,603
You will overcome

488
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,532
what the witches
did to you.

489
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:07,399
You will resist the dark
urges of their hex.

490
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:16,644
Did it work?

491
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:19,347
Ohh. How do I know
if it worked?

492
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:22,183
All I know is
that the vervain is out

493
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:24,185
and I'm at the mercy of
this murderous bastard.

494
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:26,420
I bet you find that
really funny, don't you,

495
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:28,389
Cami, you little...

496
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,424
I'm... I'm sorry.

497
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:32,060
I don't know
why I said that.

498
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:34,195
Well, I guess
that's our answer.

499
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:36,197
Wait. Klaus,
where are you going?

500
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:37,865
What are we going
to do?

501
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:40,034
I'm going to find
the witch who did this.

502
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:42,269
And then I'm going to
do what I do best.

503
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,077
I'm weaker than
I thought.

504
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:53,654
You want the deal, Soph,
you got to hold up your end.

505
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,156
I'm on a clock.

506
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,520
Ok.

507
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:03,790
It's working.

508
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:08,228
That's one. I need all 3.

509
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:09,896
I'm giving you
whatever I can pick up.

510
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,132
Keep trying.

511
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,401
Or don't.

512
00:27:13,402 --> 00:27:15,369
Who needs a locator spell
when I have all the leverage

513
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,606
I need right here?

514
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,097
No! Monique!

515
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,778
You've poisoned me
with a kiss.

516
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:28,855
Uh! At least you haven't
lost your sense of irony.

517
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,118
We may have time
for more.

518
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,753
But first, I'm going
to cure you

519
00:27:32,754 --> 00:27:36,624
of your greatest flaw...
This absurd devotion

520
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,292
to your lunatic family.

521
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:41,095
Celeste, your anger
is with me.

522
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:42,662
Now, if you have come
here seeking revenge...

523
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,765
Oh, I'll have
my revenge,

524
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:45,933
starting with Klaus.

525
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:48,468
He is gonna know
pain and torment

526
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:49,869
like he's never
felt before...

527
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,138
Unless you choose
to save him,

528
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:52,806
of course.

529
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:54,740
But then that leaves
Rebekah,

530
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,677
your tragic sister.

531
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:58,045
She's about to find
herself

532
00:27:58,046 --> 00:27:59,513
in quite
the predicament.

533
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:02,481
You could save her.

534
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,119
But then that leaves
Hayley in jeopardy.

535
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,688
No. No, no...

536
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:10,657
Ah, this poor girl.

537
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:13,126
She has no idea
how dangerous it is

538
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,527
to be loved by you.

539
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:19,099
Oh, well.

540
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,700
With your body weakened
by my spell,

541
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,469
you won't be
able to save them all.

542
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,505
You'll recover
with just enough time

543
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:27,581
to choose one.

544
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,876
Who will it be?

545
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:34,013
I can't wait
to find out.

546
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:47,127
Witches of
the French quarter,

547
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:51,463
I have with me
Monique Deveraux.

548
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:54,968
What a shame it would be
were I forced to send her

549
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:57,704
back to the death
she's just escaped.

550
00:28:57,705 --> 00:29:01,474
Should you wish
to prevent this...

551
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,377
Bring me
the witch Bastiana.

552
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:06,012
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

553
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,780
I'm opening negotiations.

554
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,782
You know my rules.
We do not hurt kids.

555
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,951
Spare me the hypocrisy
of your moral code.

556
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:15,128
It didn't stop you from
killing Monique's mother.

557
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:21,059
Bastiana!
I know you're close.

558
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,530
The stench of witches
hangs in the air.

559
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:27,200
Mark my words.

560
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:28,734
I will end this girl

561
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:30,702
with the very blade
you meant for me.

562
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,905
I'm not saying it
again.

563
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,507
We do not kill kids.

564
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:52,916
I decide who lives
and dies here, Marcellus.

565
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,897
Aah!

566
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,061
I'll take it from here.

567
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:45,260
I know it's a lot
to take in.

568
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,263
You think?

569
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,431
I just wanted
to meet my family.

570
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,734
I never imagined
I'd meet my husband

571
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:54,269
from some weird-ass
arranged marriage.

572
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,238
I guess you don't know
about any of this

573
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:59,541
because there was never
anyone around to teach you.

574
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:05,080
The crescents aren't just
any pack of wolves.

575
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:08,484
Ok? The bloodline goes
back to the very beginning...

576
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:12,387
two families...
Yours and mine.

577
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:15,691
I guess that makes us
kind of like royalty.

578
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,359
This is a joke,

579
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,896
right? I mean,

580
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:22,547
if you're royalty,
where's the throne?

581
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:30,680
New Orleans used
to be our town.

582
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:34,342
And we lost it all because
of some infighting.

583
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:36,111
The vampires came after us.

584
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:37,746
And if our
families were united,

585
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:39,022
we could have taken them.

586
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,584
So our parents
decided to bring

587
00:31:42,585 --> 00:31:44,286
the two lines back together.

588
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:47,388
And you and I
were betrothed.

589
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:49,725
I'm sorry.

590
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:52,326
This is ridiculous.

591
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,029
Look, obviously things
didn't work out

592
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,497
the way anyone thought
they would.

593
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,732
Our pack made a huge
misstep with the vampires

594
00:31:57,733 --> 00:31:59,233
when we refused
to back down.

595
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:02,704
And Marcel had us cursed
by a witch.

596
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:06,091
You are the last one of
your bloodline, Andrea.

597
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:11,221
Or, Hayley, whatever
you call yourself.

598
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:15,883
These people
will follow you.

599
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:19,153
You can help them... you
and what you represent.

600
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:21,355
And what is that
exactly?

601
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,959
A time when
things were different,

602
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,393
when our people fought back.

603
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:32,394
And after everything you
went through to find us...

604
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:34,536
You're the one who's
gonna break our curse.

605
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,373
What are you talking
about?

606
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:41,041
Your witch friend.

607
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,545
She told Eve she was
coming here tonight

608
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:44,879
to set us free.

609
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,216
Wait. What witch friend?

610
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:00,979
I'm sorry.

611
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,566
I really do like you, but
this is the deal we made.

612
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,968
What deal?

613
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:08,528
With whom?

614
00:33:58,185 --> 00:33:59,687
Hayley.

615
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:02,289
Elijah, something's going
on with the witches.

616
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,058
Listen to me. You were right.

617
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,459
Celeste is back.

618
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,673
Niklaus, Rebekah.
You're all in danger.

619
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:13,601
What's going on?

620
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:14,867
It's a trap. I didn't
make a deal with any witch.

621
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:16,270
What?

622
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,538
Hayley, you
have to find Rebekah.

623
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:19,372
And you stay with her
until I get there.

624
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,077
Elijah, it's a spell.

625
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:24,510
They're trapping us inside.

626
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:47,700
You know what to do.

627
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,344
We have to get
out of here.

628
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,192
Here. Breathe
through this.

629
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:32,145
Where's Rebekah?

630
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:34,213
I don't know.

631
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:37,116
She went off
with one of them.

632
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:40,420
Elijah, my friend is
still in there.

633
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,410
On your feet.

634
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:13,853
Help me.

635
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:16,382
It's been such a long
time, Rebekah.

636
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,193
I'm going to enjoy this.

637
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,781
Missing something?

638
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,633
You won't hurt me.

639
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,402
I'm the only one alive
who can break

640
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,970
the curse on Hayley's
family.

641
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,457
And Genevieve knows
where your sister is.

642
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,643
Bastiana has Klaus
tucked away

643
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,611
someplace safe.

644
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,880
He's suffering horribly,
I might add,

645
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,548
and all because you
chose to save

646
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,918
the little wolf instead
of your own blood.

647
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,183
What a horrific
ending...

648
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:14,298
To your pathetic,
diseased family.

649
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:24,507
I guess "always" isn't
forever after all.

650
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,715
I have to go. The moon.

651
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,949
Listen, Jackson,

652
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,485
I want to thank you
for protecting me,

653
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:36,987
not just tonight.

654
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,622
I've been dreaming to thank you
about meeting you,

655
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,008
since I was a kid.

656
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,126
I never thought
it would go like this.

657
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:47,557
Hey...

658
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,834
I won't stop
until I find a way

659
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:51,936
to break this curse.

660
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:55,607
I promise.

661
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:04,313
Come on. Come on. Come on.

662
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:08,151
Klaus, where are you?

663
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,753
Mr. Mikaelson
is currently indisposed.

664
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:15,592
What happened?
What did you do?

665
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,327
I did nothing.

666
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,028
Someone completed
your task for you.

667
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:21,931
If you got what you
wanted, then my Uncle...

668
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,165
Will die soon

669
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,967
and in great anguish.

670
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:27,270
You see, dear, you failed
to hold up your end

671
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,805
of our bargain.

672
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,075
You chose instead to side
with evil as your Uncle

673
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,062
has done many times
before you.

674
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:37,080
But take heart.

675
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,015
His punishment will atone
for his attempts

676
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,482
to prevent the harvest.

677
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:42,952
His suffering
will purify him.

678
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,853
You'd do well to heed
his lesson, girl.

679
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:48,558
To oppose us is to oppose
the natural order.

680
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,327
By choice or by force,

681
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:53,429
the witches
of the French quarter

682
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,297
will rise again.

683
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:03,305
We looked everywhere
for him.

684
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:05,641
Tore apart the cauldron,
the city of the dead.

685
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:07,709
Wherever they got him,
he ain't in the quarter.

686
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,878
Marcel!

687
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,347
Where is my brother?

688
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,382
I got guys out
looking for him right now.

689
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:21,156
Elijah!

690
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:25,828
Klaus threw one of his
classic temper tantrums,

691
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,196
snapped my neck,

692
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,831
tried to take on a coven
of witches by himself.

693
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:30,266
He got dropped.

694
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,501
I don't know where he is
or how to find him.

695
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:35,456
They also have Rebekah.

696
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:43,445
Every one of you
will help me

697
00:39:43,446 --> 00:39:45,633
to find them.

698
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:48,816
I'm going to kill
them all.

699
00:39:54,923 --> 00:39:56,625
Come on. We have to go.

700
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,646
I don't want to go.

701
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:02,064
Monique, this isn't
a debate.

702
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,333
I just stabbed
an original.

703
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:05,601
He's gonna kill me

704
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:07,322
as soon as he's
recovered.

705
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:10,806
Look...

706
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:12,973
I'm sorry
for everything.

707
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:15,142
I should have
come and got you

708
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:16,777
before that stupid
harvest.

709
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:20,614
But you can still
have a normal life,

710
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:25,786
one without all this
crazy witch nonsense.

711
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,493
But I am a witch.

712
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:34,995
And I don't want to go.

713
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:41,503
Monique?

714
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:44,272
The ancestors said you
didn't have enough faith.

715
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:47,541
I was
hoping they were wrong.

716
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,911
I should
have known better.

717
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:55,983
Monique...

718
00:40:55,984 --> 00:40:58,285
You tried to stop
the harvest.

719
00:40:58,286 --> 00:40:59,653
Please don't do this.

720
00:40:59,654 --> 00:41:00,722
Now you want to run

721
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:02,423
when we need to stay
and fight.

722
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:04,491
Please. I'm begging
you, don't... don't...

723
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:06,027
The four of us,
when we return,

724
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,529
we'll have enough power
to rid the city

725
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,364
of vampires, and we'll
kill anyone...

726
00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:14,568
Who doesn't keep
the faith.

727
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:19,173
Monique...

728
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:20,140
Please...

729
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,676
You should have
believed.

730
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:24,607
Stop. Please.

731
00:41:58,106 --> 00:42:03,231
