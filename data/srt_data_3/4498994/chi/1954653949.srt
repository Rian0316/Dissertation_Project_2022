1
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:06,060
Max 猜猜Han在柜台做什么?
Max, guess what Han's doing at the counter?

2
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,897
反正不是在俯瞰柜台
Well, I know it's not towering over it.

3
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:12,900
他在为餐厅研制特色饮料
He's creating signature drinks for the diner.

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:17,338
我的建议是 在刨冰上加家常毒药
I suggested any household poison over shaved ice.

5
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,706
Han 这想法太蠢了
Han, this is a stupid idea.

6
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:20,774
这是Earl的想法
It was Earl's.

7
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,477
那这想法太棒了
Then it's genius.

8
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:28,582
是啊 我整个下午都在免费喝酒
Yep, I've been drinking all afternoon for free.

9
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,084
现在我只用顶级的酒
Now, I've used only top shelf liquor.

10
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:35,255
提问 谁帮你拿下来的?
Question: Who got it down for you?

11
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:38,325
第一款 "Max酒" 这只是杯威士忌
First up: "The Max". It's just whiskey.

12
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:42,362
酒加冰块(不断碰壁) 就像Max的工作
On the rocks, like Max's job.

13
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:46,665
不管我的酒是什么 我希望杯沿沾上盐
Whatever mine is, I want my rim salted.

14
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:51,805
当然可以
Of course you do.

15
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,574
"Earl酒"是一款什么都加的老式鸡尾酒
Earl's is an Old Fashioned with everything.

16
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:56,543
再给我倒杯"我"
Pour me another me.

17
00:00:56,544 --> 00:01:00,747
我不想承认 但我很容易醉
I hate to say it, but I go down easy.

18
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:04,651
"Caroline酒"是装在稍微结霜的杯子里的柠檬甜酒
"The Caroline" is Lemon Schnapps in a slightly frosty glass.

19
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:06,920
是因为我那格蕾丝·凯利式的优雅举止吗?
Because of my cool, Grace Kelly kind of demeanor?

20
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,822
不是 是因为在卖酒的地方
No, because they had a sale on Lemon Schnapps

21
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:11,858
柠檬甜酒在促销
at Beverage Barn.

22
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:14,928
那里不用出示身份证吗?
Oh, they don't card there?

23
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,830
好了 那"Han酒"是什么?
Okay, so what's "The Han"?

24
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,899
沙滩上的"无性"酒吗?
A No Sex on the Beach?

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,535
我的是一款经典的摇和马提尼酒
Mine is a classic martini, shaken.

26
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:25,196
就像第一个看见你裸体的女人一样颤抖不停
Oh, like the first woman who saw you naked.

27
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:30,510
纠正
Correction.

28
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,713
是将要看见的
Will see you naked.

Max 猜猜看 你迅速跑向厕所的两小时内
Max, guess what happened when you were running

34
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:54,770
发生了什么
to the bathroom real quick, for two hours.

35
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,027
你在柜台卖纸杯蛋糕
You worked the cupcake window while I went

36
00:01:57,028 --> 00:01:59,552
而我去看了自由女神像
to see The Statue of Liberty.

37
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,521
她的头正在被翻新
Her head was being renovated.

38
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,824
城里的每个人都在工作
Everybody in this town is getting work done.

39
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,859
我卖掉了最后一件纸杯蛋糕T恤!
I sold our last cupcake tee!

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,461
我们卖掉的比罗伯特·德尼罗
We've sold out more than Robert De Niro

41
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,731
在他职业生涯的最后20年里卖的还多
in the last 20 years of his career.

42
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:16,035
"老大靠边闪" 逊毙了
Well, Analyze This, Focker.

43
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:16,035
{\an8}"老大靠边闪" 罗伯特·德尼罗主演的电影

44
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,237
我注意到 我们上周快要缺货了
I noticed we were running low last week,

45
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,873
所以我又进了点货
so I ordered more.

46
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,975
我怎么没早发现那些呢?
How did I not notice those sooner?

47
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,064
哦 很可能是因为我上次往里看的时候
Oh, probably because the last time I looked in there,

48
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:29,315
有只老鼠正和蟑螂嘿咻
there was a rat having sex with a cockroach.

49
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,751
告诉你 它们还在约会
You know, they're still dating.

50
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,453
真的吗? 我还以为是一夜情
Really? I thought it was a one time thing.

51
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:39,225
我猜你一旦上了老鼠 就永不回头了
Well, I guess once you go rat, you never go back.

52
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:39,225
{\an8}go rat出自DOTA术语"只推塔 不团战"

53
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,727
谢谢你进了这些货 我最近都忙着
Thanks for ordering these, I've just been so busy

54
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,095
准备Sophie的告别单身派对
with Sophie's wedding shower.

55
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,397
是啊 我们为什么这么尽心尽力?
Yeah, why are you working so hard?

56
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,798
又不是什么大事
It's not a big deal.

57
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,033
我还帮我妈告别过单身呢
I threw my mother a shower once.

58
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,736
不对 等等 我是直接把她扔到雨里过
No, wait, I threw her in a shower once.

59
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,339
Max 你真的不该这么抱怨了
Max, you really need to start making more of a fuss.

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,007
这是为了Sophie 这对她很重要
It's for Sophie, it means a lot to her,

61
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,376
而且她还有枪
and she has a gun.

62
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,145
单身派对是傻姑娘的事情
Well, showers are stupid girl things

63
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,116
而这条汉子不想参与
that this guy wants no part of.

64
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,486
嘿 姑娘们!
Hey, girls!

65
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,423
看 我在给你们的纸杯蛋糕做广告
Look. I'm advertising your cupcake business.

66
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,194
你是在做广告 但不是我们的纸杯蛋糕广告
You're advertising something, but it's not our cupcakes.

67
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,496
我给我们楼的住户发放了免费T恤
I gave out free T-shirts to our building.

68
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,698
我在每家每户门口都留了一件
I left one by everyone's door.

69
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,900
Sophie家两件 Sanchez家16件
Two at Sophie's, 16 at the Sanchez's.

70
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,404
大概有六个孩子得共穿一件
So about six of the kids will have to share.

71
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,440
真有趣 现在我们的T恤
Interesting. Now our shirts are available at both Rodney,

72
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,375
在高档的曼哈顿时装店"Rodney"
the high-end Manhattan boutique,

73
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,144
和一栋永远飘着汽油味儿的公寓楼里
and an apartment building that always smells

74
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,247
都能拿到
a little like gasoline.

75
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,750
请不要再聊些跟我无关的事情了
Well, please stop talking about things that aren't me.

76
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:43,522
姑娘们 你们准备好
Now girls, did you get the cake

77
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,724
明天我的单身派对上的蛋糕了吗?
for my wedding shower tomorrow?

78
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,060
哦 我还要做个蛋糕吗?
Oh, was I supposed to make a cake?

79
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,095
我完全没有为这个派对做任何事情
I've literally done nothing for this shower.

80
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,532
我连澡都没有洗
I haven't even taken a bath.

81
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,368
不 我不要这里的蛋糕
Oh, no, I'm not getting my cake from here.

82
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,670
不行 这是我的婚前派对
No, this is my bridal shower.

83
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,673
对 我要从Baskin Robbins冰淇淋店买点经典甜品
Yeah, I want to get something classic from Baskin Robbins

84
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:05,443
还有Dunkin甜甜圈
that's also a Dunkin' Donuts.

85
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,846
他们现在把这两样混搭了?
They mix those two now?

86
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,449
斯通纳(主持)的梦想成真了
It's a Stoner's dream come true.

87
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,151
我想让我们的公寓好看一点
I tried to make our apartment look nice.

88
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,387
我甚至挪动椅子来遮住污渍
I even moved a chair to cover a stain,

89
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,822
但椅子下面更脏
but what was under the chair was so much worse.

90
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:21,559
我想说的是 请不要开枪打我们
I guess what I'm saying is, please don't shoot us.

91
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,629
我没期待它有好多看
Well, I don't expect it to look that good.

92
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,166
你们不能给猪戴上大礼帽
I mean, you can't put a silk hat on a pig.

93
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,768
我知道 是因为我试过一次
And I know, 'cause I tried once.

94
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,892
Max! 天啊! 你干了什么?
Max! Oh, my God! What have you done?

95
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:58,396
我觉得我不喜欢草莓馅的
I realized I don't like a strawberry center.

96
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:01,966
但我不会为此揍自己一顿
And I am not going to beat myself up about it.

97
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,368
我让你去拿皱纸带
When I told you to get crepe paper streamers

98
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:08,372
装饰下派对的时候 我说的是粉红色 不是黑色
and decorate for the shower, I meant with pink, not black.

99
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,174
这是Sophie的单身派对
It's a wedding shower for Sophie,

100
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:14,145
不是"魔鬼圣婴"的洗礼会
not a baby shower for Rosemary's Baby.

101
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,214
什么? 我跟你说了 我不会做小女生的事情
What? I told you, I don't do girl things.

102
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:21,619
像挂粉红彩带 或者坐着尿尿
Like hang pink or sit when I pee.

103
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,458
我正好提到了"挂粉红彩带"这项
Which, coincidentally, I refer to as "hanging pink."

104
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,693
天啊 什么味道?
My God, what is that smell?

105
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:31,795
这里真的有什么东西坏了
Something's really gone bad here.

106
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:34,398
包括我们的生活
Besides our lives.

107
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,966
这是波兰食物
It's the Polish food.

108
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:39,503
我想其中有根香肠是用穿过的人字拖做的
I think one of those sausages is made of old flip-flops.

109
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,673
已经有人来了?
Someone's here already?

110
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:44,141
波兰人都这么早吗?
Are Polish people always early?

111
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:49,880
这是什么我不知道的刻板印象吗?
Is that a stereotype I don't know about?

112
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:54,418
我滴个乖乖!
Oh my God!

113
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,554
我的单身派对?
A wedding shower for me?

114
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:02,659
要是早知道 我就好好打扮一番了!
I mean, if I had known, I would have dressed!

115
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,428
Sophie 你确实知道啊
Sophie, you did know.

116
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:07,898
我知道 我提早下来练习一下入场
I know. I came down early to practice some entrances.

117
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,970
现在准备排练入场方式二
Now get ready for entrance number two.

118
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:17,741
你能想象第二种入场啥样吗?
Are you ever ready for entrance number two?

119
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:24,114
谁啊?
Who is it?

120
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:29,252
亲娘啊!
Oh my God!

121
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:31,788
简直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

122
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,692
哦 今天是我的单身派对啊
Oh, it's the day of my wedding shower.

123
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:41,097
还有什么比这更美好的?
Could anything be more wonderful?

124
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:42,299
我好感动 好惊讶
I was moved, I was surprised.

125
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,800
比圣经还要喜欢
I liked it better than the Book.

126
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:46,469
现在 进来指出哪些是波兰食物
Now, come on in here and identify some of this

127
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,806
这样我就知道晚上什么不能吃了
Polish food so I can know what I'm not eating tonight.

128
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,308
哦 不 我派对上不吃东西
Oh, no. I'm not eating at my shower.

129
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:54,344
我在假装自己有进食障碍症
I'm pretending I have an eating disorder

130
00:06:54,345 --> 00:07:00,016
这样大家就以为我拥有一切了
so everyone will think that I have it all.

131
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,550
我觉得你会很开心的
I think you're going to be happy.

132
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,086
我有很多好玩的单身派对游戏
I have lots of fun shower games,

133
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,989
从"谁最了解Sophie"开始
starting with "Who Knows The Most About Sophie?"

134
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,758
哦 这个肯定我赢
Oh, I'll win that one.

135
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,826
是啊
Yeah.

136
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,628
Sophie得上厕所了
And Sophie's got to tinkle.

137
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,531
看到没? 这事都知道肯定赢
See? I'm a shoo-in.

138
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:18,301
哦 哦 天啊
Yeah. Oh. Oh, my gosh.

139
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:20,603
黑色厕纸
Black toilet paper.

140
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:23,473
做得不错 两位妞儿
Oh, nice touch, girls.

141
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:28,210
嗯 我就喜欢擦完还不知道的神秘感
Yeah, I love the mystery of not knowing when you're done.

142
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:34,984
联邦调查局! 开门!
FBI! Open up!

143
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:38,120
联邦调查局? 我没请他们啊
The FBI? I don't think they RSVP'd.

144
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:41,958
哦 肯定是来抓我的
Oh, that's got to be for me.

145
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,793
我啥也没干
I didn't do it.

146
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:46,629
而且告诉你 纽瓦克的那件事
And just so you know, the statute of limitations is up

147
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,265
已经过了诉讼时效了
on that Newark thing.

148
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,967
我不是来抓你的 小姐
I'm not here to arrest you, miss.

149
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:52,401
这下好了 抓我来的
Great, it's me.

150
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:55,271
Max 我都说盗印电影是犯罪了
Max, I told you pirating movies was a real crime.

151
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:59,875
这下我要因为"五十度灰"进局子了
Now I'm going to jail for Fifty Shades Of Grey.

152
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:02,912
总得有人进去
Someone should.

153
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,713
我听到了 你不是我想象中的
I hear you, not the Christian Grey

154
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:09,385
Christian Grey(五十度灰女主人公)
I'd pictured.

155
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:11,153
我是联邦调查局的Drake探员
I'm Agent Drake with the FBI.

156
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:13,389
不用担心 但是你们楼里有个男人
Nothing to get upset about, but there's a man in your building

157
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,557
在他的公寓里扣留了三个女人
who's been holding three women hostage

158
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,425
做人质有数月了
in his apartment for months.

159
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:19,361
嗯 这听起来才对
Yeah, that sounds about right.

160
00:08:19,362 --> 00:08:21,063
现在 其中一个被关押的今天逃出去
Now, one of the captives escaped today

161
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,731
报警了
and alerted authorities.

162
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:23,933
哦 肯定是我在大厅里遇到的
Oh, that must have been the lady I passed

163
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,202
尖叫的那位女士
screaming in the hall.

164
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:29,071
怎么了? 这栋楼里"人质"和"精神错乱"之间
What? There is a fine line between "hostage"

165
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:32,708
还是有区别的
and "off your meds" in this building.

166
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:33,842
所以 特警队要进来
So, a SWAT team is going in

167
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:35,177
解救楼上剩余的两位
for the other two still upstairs.

168
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:36,969
但我们首先要清空楼内
But we need to evacuate the building first.

169
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,780
所以请吧
So let's go.

170
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:40,916
好的 我能先收拾下东西吗
All right, can I just put a few things away first.

171
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:43,185
你知道 如果有警察要进来的话
You know, because I want the place to look nice

172
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:46,088
我希望家里看起来干净些
if there's going to be police in here.

173
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,756
听着 小姐 不过你家里藏了什么毒品
Look, miss, whatever drugs you're hiding in here,

174
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:48,857
我完全不在乎
I couldn't care less.

175
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,759
我们得马上出去
We need to get out now.

176
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,729
你知道吗 你完全是我的理想型
You know, you're just my type of guy.

177
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,965
你不介意我用药 而且已经在家门口了
You don't mind my drug use and you're already here.

178
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:05,941
哦 对味儿!
Oh, yeah!

179
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:11,513
你们还请了脱衣警察来我的单身派对?
You girls ordered a cop stripper for my bridal shower?

180
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:15,150
哦 新娘这就来了!
Oh, here comes the bride all right!

181
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,086
来啊 
Come on. Yeah.

182
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:22,079
嗯 看到没? 他喜欢我
Yeah, see? Look, he likes me.

183
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,003
真不敢相信我住的楼里
I cannot believe I live in this building

184
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,739
竟然有男人做这么可怕的事
with a man who would do something so awful.

185
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,109
当然 也不敢相信我竟然住在这样的楼里
Also, cannot believe I live in this building.

186
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,744
你知道我觉得是谁吗?
You know who I think it is?

187
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,714
一身猫味却不养猫男
Smells Like Cats But Has No Cats.

188
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:45,284
是吗? 他看起来不像个行动派啊
Really? He doesn't seem like a go-getter.

189
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:49,188
我觉得是三个乳头没鼻子男
I think it's Three Nipples No Nose.

190
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:53,292
三个乳头没鼻子男? 他人很开朗啊
Three Nipples No Nose? He's a delight.

191
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,528
Sophie 你不难过吗?
Sophie, isn't this upsetting?

192
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,296
当然了
It sure is.

193
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,333
那个脱衣警察就是不肯脱裤子
I couldn't get that stripper cop to take his pants off.

194
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,237
嘿 快看 我的派对客人们来了
Hey, look, there's some of my shower guests.

195
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,072
快看
Oh, look.

196
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,607
看到没? 那个是我的朋友Natalya
And see? That one's my friend Natalya.

197
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,142
跟你们提过的那个
The one I told you about.

198
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,544
没错 瞧那多余的皮肤
Yeah, there's all that extra skin.

199
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,381
天啊 你真没夸张
Ew. You were not exaggerating.

200
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,483
那皮肤是天生的
She was born with all that skin.

201
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,418
她整个高中都得
She had a chip clip on her back

202
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,922
在背上夹个夹子
all through high school.

203
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,792
嗯 我知道楼上的家伙真让人扫兴
Yeah, I know that guy upstairs is a real bummer,

204
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,294
但你知道什么有帮助吗?
but you know what would help?

205
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,097
要是我能开礼物的话
If I could open my presents.

206
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,799
没错
Yeah.

207
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,701
哦 不!
Oh, no!

208
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,603
警察不让她们过来!
The fuzz isn't letting them through!

209
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,204
哦 拜托
Oh, come on.

210
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,407
不公平 他们几分钟前还放一个男的进来了
No fair, they just let a guy in here a few minutes ago.

211
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,643
我朋友们不是炸弹搜寻犬
Just 'cause your friends aren't bomb-sniffing dogs,

212
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,846
就不让进吗? 切!
they can't get in? Boo!

213
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:52,150
听着 姐妹们 把你们的礼物递给条子
Hey, look, ladies, pass your presents up to the cops.

214
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,887
条子 把我的礼物递给我
Cops, pass my presents to me.

215
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,656
等等 Sophie 在你打开它们前
Wait, Sophie, before you open them,

216
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,658
我真得很想记下是谁送的礼
I really want to write down who got you what.

217
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,428
还有 留着那条漂亮的丝带 我给你做顶蝴蝶结帽!
And save that pretty ribbon, I'm gonna make you a bow hat!

218
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,596
看看你
Look at you.

219
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,132
有个疯子绑架了三名无辜女性
Making lemonade out of a maniac

220
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,668
你还能这么苦中作乐
holding three innocent women hostage.

221
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,469
一张礼品卡
Oh, a gift card.

222
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,739
把它寄回去
Oh, send it back.

223
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,308
Sophie 换做我们就会收下它
Sophie, we would've taken that.

224
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,709
虽然不知道它的用处
I don't know what is was for,

225
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,678
但我就知道 我们会收下它
I just know that we would've taken it.

226
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,279
不 我要把它寄回去
No, I'm sending it back.

227
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,015
我要的是礼物 不是多一份差事
I want a gift, not another errand.

228
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,153
好吧 我不太喜欢这个包装 但...
Oh, yeah, not in love with the paper, but...

229
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,790
还是等打开后再做定论吧
well, I'll wait till I open it to judge.

230
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,424
嗨 打扰一下
Hi. Excuse me.

231
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:34,692
打扰一下?
Excuse me?

232
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,395
我是Maria Alonso-Gonzalez
I'm Maria Alonso-Gonzalez.

233
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,830
能请两位女士对着镜头
Could you ladies talk to Channel 2

234
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,865
谈谈今晚这里的骇人发现吗?
about tonight's disturbing discovery?

235
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,233
- 没门  - 当然
- No.  - Yes.

236
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,369
只管跟着我和我的商业头脑走
Just go with me and my business savvy.

237
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,805
是的 Maria Alonso-Gonzalez 我们可以回答几个问题
Yes, Maria Alonso-Gonzalez, we can answer a few questions.

238
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:50,541
有任何迹象表明 你所居住的楼房里暗藏
Were there any signs at all that something of this nature

239
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,510
此类性质的犯罪吗?
was going on in your building?

240
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,245
我们只是希望 住我们楼里的这个变态
We just hope they bring this sick freak

241
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,548
能被绳之于法 
in our building to justice

242
00:11:55,549 --> 00:12:00,051
好让我们回到"Max自制纸杯蛋糕店"继续工作
so that we can return to work at Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

243
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,786
转拍大门 他出来了
Get on the door. Here he comes.

244
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,521
这人是谁? 谁是这个变态?
Who is it? Who is this sick freak?

245
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:11,162
不是我
It's not me.

246
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,598
是我吗?
Is it?

247
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,835
我不太确定 我被指控了什么?
I'm not sure, what are the charges?

248
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,104
同是变态 各不相同
Different sick freak.

249
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:23,741
嘿 Rula Uma Greta 看啊
Hey, Rula, Uma, Greta, look.

250
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,076
就是这人
This is him.

251
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,679
我的未来夫君
This is the groom-to-be.

252
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,581
忘了楼上那个家伙吧
Forget about the guy upstairs,

253
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:35,486
这才是货真价实的床上狂魔
this is the real maniac in the bedroom.

254
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:38,856
就是他?
That's him?

255
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:41,392
啤酒肚运动裤男?
Beer Belly Gym Shorts?

256
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,127
- 怎么都猜不到  - 糟了
- Never would've guessed.  - Oh, no.

257
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:45,629
他穿着我们的衣服
He's wearing one of our shirts.

258
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,797
为什么?
Why?

259
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:50,233
为什么? 他为什么要穿中号的?
Why? Why is he wearing a medium?

260
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:57,541
哦...
Oh...

261
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,242
没人会在意那个的
I mean, nobody's gonna see that.

262
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,351
警察已经逮捕了嫌疑犯
Police have just apprehended the suspect

263
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:10,454
而现在每个人心中的困惑是
and the question on everyone's mind is,

264
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,789
Max自制纸杯蛋糕店究竟和此事
"What does Max's Homemade Cupcakes

265
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,060
有什么牵连?
have to do with this?"

266
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,762
我们无可奉告
We have no comment.

267
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:22,199
也没有未来和除臭剂
Or future, or deodorant.

268
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,735
所以别来烦我们!
So leave us alone!

269
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,403
他们怎么知道我们在这破地方工作
How did they find out we work in this dump,

270
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:27,838
旁边靠着另外那个破地方?
next door to the other dump?

271
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,272
我说完才意识到 我们的职业生涯
As I'm saying it, I realize our career

272
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,875
全搭在这两破地方了
is made up of two dumps.

273
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,644
听起来像是我们的职业生涯咖啡喝多了
Sounds like our career has been drinking too much coffee.

274
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:37,848
报纸上通篇在报道这事
The story is all over the paper.

275
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,751
他们称那些女性为"纸杯蛋糕俘虏"
They're calling those ladies "The Cupcake Captives,"

276
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,753
称那家伙为"纸杯蛋糕绑匪"
calling that guy "The Cupcake Captor,"

277
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:46,790
还称整个事件为"纸杯蛋糕大浩劫"
and calling the whole thing "The Cupcake Catastrophe."

278
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,825
但你们不用担心这事会损坏你们
But you needn't worry about it reflecting badly

279
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,428
纸杯蛋糕生意的声誉
on your cupcake business.

280
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:54,865
糟了 这事还上时尚专区了
Oh, no. It's even in the fashion section.

281
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:57,367
上面有我们衣服的图片 还写着
There's a picture of our shirts and it says,

282
00:13:57,368 --> 00:14:01,805
"不要穿这个 永远不要"
"What not to wear, ever."

283
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:04,140
好吧 各位冷静一下
Okay. Everybody calm down.

284
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:06,409
我多半是在说自己
I'm mostly talking to myself.

285
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,611
媒体就喜欢兴风作浪
The media is just going to do its thing.

286
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:10,780
我之前也被头条诽谤过
I've been slandered in the headlines before.

287
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:14,517
被称为"庞氏骗局公主" "破产芭比"
I was called "Ponzi Princess," "Bankrupt Barbie."

288
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:17,787
回首往事 那些竟是最美好的时光
Looking back, those were the best of times.

289
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:20,356
各位好啊 我刚打算递一盘
Oh, hello. I was just about to take a tray

290
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:23,193
Max和Carolines酒招待我的记者朋友们
of Max and Carolines out to my reporter friends.

291
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:26,162
抱歉 你可以拿这些Max和Carolines酒
Sorry, you can give those Max and Carolines

292
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:29,532
招待Max和Caroline
to this Max and Caroline.

293
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,868
嗨 各位亲
Hi, everybody.

294
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,870
哦 我抑郁极了
Oh, I'm depressed.

295
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:38,341
瞧 连你们都看得出 因为我只戴了一半的假发
See, you can tell 'cause I'm only wearing half my hair.

296
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:41,444
姐妹们 我在你们家门前发现了这个箱子
Girls, I found this box outside your door.

297
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:44,280
我当时还以为这是单身派对礼物
And I was hoping it was a shower present.

298
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:49,685
因为那些自私的人质姑娘毁了我的大好日子
Since those selfish hostage girls ruined my special day.

299
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:53,623
天啊 我都没能拿到那顶蝴蝶结帽
Oh, man. I didn't even get a freakin' ribbon hat.

300
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:56,893
你想要我用警示带做的抹胸吗?
Do you want the tube top I made out of the police tape?

301
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:59,228
我管它叫"警示抹胸"
I'm calling it a tape top.

302
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:01,330
专利申请中
Patent pending.

303
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:02,565
好啦 各位
Come on, you guys.

304
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,833
这不关我们的事
This isn't about us.

305
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,668
我们要理性看待这事
We need to put this all in perspective.

306
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,137
我们都没事 健健康康的 还有...
We're all safe, and healthy, and...

307
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:10,306
天啊 正当我觉得不能承受更多时
Oh, my God, just when I can't take anymore,

308
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,641
更多的不幸就来了
here comes anymore.

309
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:15,544
"我们要退还你们T恤剩余的存货
"We are returning the remainder of your T-shirt stock.

310
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:18,180
我们Rodney品牌不愿与你们的产品有牵连
Our Rodney brand cannot be associated with a product

311
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:21,484
因为它涉及了一项正在进行中的刑事调查
at the center of an ongoing criminal investigation.

312
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,019
我们的合约就此作废"
Consider our contract null and void."

313
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,522
真是让人震惊
This is so shocking.

314
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:30,025
Max 你竟然识字?
Max, you can read?

315
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:35,764
看来你只是不肯把特价菜单报给客人
So you just didn't want to tell people the specials.

316
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,099
真是难以置信
I can't believe this.

317
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,767
我们盼了这么久 希望有事发生在
We waited so long for something to happen

318
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,402
我们的纸杯蛋糕T恤上
to our cupcake t-shirts.

319
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,770
为什么是他?
Why that guy?

320
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:43,320
而且是正好在他不想穿那件
And on the one day he chooses to not wear

321
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,641
写着"拉我手指"T恤的时候
his "Pull my finger" shirt.

322
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,544
我是Maria Alonso-Gonzalez 在Max自制纸杯蛋糕店...
This is Maria Alonso-Gonzalez, reporting to you live...

323
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:50,092
Max 你在干什么? 他们会看到我们的
Max, what are you doing? They'll see us.

324
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:51,547
- 现场为您带来的报道  - 他们看不到的
- From Max's Homemade Cupcakes.  - No they won't,

325
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:54,783
因为所有的摄像机都对着Han
Because all the cameras are on Han right now.

326
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:56,552
你能谈一下 Max自制纸杯蛋糕店背后的
Can you talk a little bit about the women

327
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,421
两位女性的故事吗?
behind Max's Homemade Cupcakes?

328
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:01,857
就这么说吧 Max和Caroline
Well, let's just say Max and Caroline

329
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:04,359
对工作过敏 就像是
are allergic to work, much in the same way

330
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,294
Dilbert对周一过敏一样
Dilbert is allergic to Mondays.

331
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:11,767
继续 Maria Alonso-Gonzalez
Moving on, Maria Alonso-Gonzalez,

332
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,635
您想不想来威廉斯堡餐厅
would you care to come into The Williamsburg Diner,

333
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:16,171
贝德福德大道6355号
6355 Bedford Avenue,

334
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:17,939
营业时间从早上八点到凌晨两点
open 8:00 A.M. till 2:00 A.M.,

335
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,610
来喝一杯我们的招牌饮料"纸杯蛋糕绑架小宇宙"?
for our signature drink: The Cupcake Captive Cosmo?

336
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:26,113
至于先生们 想来杯"纸杯蛋糕绑架鳕鱼"?
And for you gents, The Captive Cape Cod?

337
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:29,751
嘿 把那些纸杯蛋糕从垃圾桶里拿出来
Hey, get these cupcakes out of the garbage.

338
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:32,787
我得给Han的尸体腾出点位子
I need to make room for Han's body.

339
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:36,424
我要留着他的头来警告其他想要惹我们的人
I'm keeping the head as a warning to others who cross us.

340
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:38,126
我们得找做新闻的人安排一次采访
We need to take back our t-shirts' image

341
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,028
拯救一下我们T恤的形象
by setting up an interview with the news.

342
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,063
我说"我们"的时候 我是说你
And by "we," I mean you.

343
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:46,234
听着 如果我在上"执法先锋"节目时得了一个教训的话
Look, if I learned one thing from my time on Cops,

344
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:49,304
那就是我得花三秒整才能跳过一个篱笆
it's that I can hop a fence in three seconds flat.

345
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,439
如果得了两个教训的话 那就是摄像机
If I learned two things, it's that the camera

346
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,541
让我看上去有罪
makes me look guilty.

347
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:57,045
特别是那个在香蕉共和国里的监控录像机
Especially when it's a security camera at Banana Republic.

348
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,379
我可不能去
I can't do it.

349
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,296
这个世界不能知道Caroline Channing
The world can't know that Caroline Channing

350
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:02,550
和另外一场备受瞩目的犯罪相关
is involved in another high-profile crime.

351
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:05,286
而且还一点都没有保养她的指甲
And hasn't kept up her nail maintenance, like, at all.

352
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:06,721
好吧
Fine.

353
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:09,957
如果我在上"执法先锋"节目时得了三个教训的话
Because if I learned three things from Cops,

354
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,926
就是最好在还没有被剥光之前趁早投降
it's that it's best to surrender early and not naked.

355
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:23,204
我们很感激你们抽出时间来和我们谈
We really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us.

356
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:24,772
如果你们想谢我
If you really want to thank me,

357
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:27,808
能不能给我的脸上打点马赛克?
how about I get some pixels up over my grill?

358
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,679
有几个小孩在找我 我不想帮他们
I got some kids looking for me and they don't need the help.

359
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,814
这个我们做不到
We don't have the capability to do that.

360
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:35,349
这是电视直播
This is live TV.

361
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,319
那么那种变声装置怎么样?
How about one of those voice distorting machines?

362
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,822
就是那种能把我的声音变得像大胖变形金刚的
You know, make my voice sound like a fat Transformer.

363
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:44,725
呃 没有
Um, no.

364
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,160
没问题
No problem.

365
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,028
我会自己搞定的
I'll take care of that myself.

366
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:51,565
以前也干过
Been in this sitch before.

367
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,801
好吧 3秒 2秒...
All right, in 3, 2...

368
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,829
晚上好 在威廉斯堡...
Good evening. In Williamsburg...

369
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,462
Max 如果你需要我的话 我就在这里
Max, I'm right here, if you need me.

370
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:59,096
我能搞定
I got this.

371
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:00,564
这个因为令人震惊的"纸杯蛋糕绑架案"而声名狼藉的地方
Now infamous in the shocking "Cupcake Captives" story.

372
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:04,601
我和店主Max Black在一起
I'm here with the owner, Max Black.

373
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:09,506
嗨 Maria
Hi, Maria.

374
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:12,509
Max  你知道Richard Griffin是Max自制纸杯蛋糕店
Max, how upset were you to see that Richard Griffin

375
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,212
最大粉丝的时候 你烦恼吗?
was Max's Homemade Cupcakes' biggest fan?

376
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:17,214
我非常不高兴
I was really upset.

377
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,349
好吧 嗨 我来吧
Okay, hi. Stepping in.

378
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,318
Max看来是因为这一切
Max is clearly so upset by all this

379
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,387
难过得都疯了
that she's lost her mind.

380
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:25,889
我真的需要她的时候就掉链子
The one time I really needed her, anyway.

381
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,291
嗨 Maria
Hi, Maria.

382
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,693
你的公司和一个在家里
How will your company's reputation recover

383
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:31,428
囚禁了三个女人的男人做生意
from doing business with a man

384
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:34,731
你们的名声要怎么恢复?
who held three women in his apartment against their will?

385
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,933
听着 人们会做一些可怕的事
Look, people do terrible things.

386
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:40,103
还是穿着衣服在做
And they do them wearing shirts.

387
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:41,605
这并不代表衣服是邪恶的
That doesn't make the shirt evil.

388
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,874
如果一件衣服犯了罪 那就把它关起来吧
Now, if a shirt commits a crime, lock it up.

389
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,909
我不会和你争论的
You'll get no argument from me.

390
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,114
- 我需要回来吗?  - 我能搞定
- Should I jump back in?  - I got this

391
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:53,216
好吧 呃 我们时间到了
Okay, yeah. That's all the time we have.

392
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,251
- 谢谢  - 嗯哼
- Thank you.  - Mm-hmm.

393
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:56,912
谢谢
Thank you.

394
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,661
Caroline 谢谢你为我办单身派对
Caroline, thank you for trying to throw me a shower.

395
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:08,231
我是说 我们一直不是什么亲密的朋友
I mean, we were never really friends or close.

396
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,633
是啊 我逃跑是因为你走向
And yeah, I run away when I see you heading towards

397
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,502
那个信箱的时候 我...
the mailboxes the same time as me...

398
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:15,405
别谢我了
Please stop thanking me.

399
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,474
嘿 想来我们家吗?
Hey. Want to come to our place?

400
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:19,676
那些猪蹄还没坏呢
Those pig feet haven't gone bad.

401
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,678
我猜是猪蹄 很难辨别
I guess. It's hard to tell.

402
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,950
是啊 最美味的肉就在指甲下面
Yeah. The best meat's under the toe nails.

403
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,331
是吗?
Is it?

404
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,325
惊喜
Surprise.

405
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:40,196
天啊 这是怎么回事?
Oh, my God, what's all this?

406
00:19:40,197 --> 00:19:41,531
天啊 我太吃惊了
Oh, no. I'm so surprised.

407
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:43,933
我这次是真的很吃惊
No, I really am this time.

408
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,302
- 我也是  - 我也是
- So am I.  - Me, too.

409
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,004
在我尝到这个香肠之前 我还以为吃过的
Until this sausage, I thought the grossest thing

410
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,939
最难吃的东西是甘蓝呢
I'd ever eaten was kale.

411
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,774
天啊 真不敢相信
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

412
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,744
还有什么能比这更好吗?
Could anything be more wonderful?

413
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,949
Max 真不敢相信你做了这件事
Max, I can't believe you did all this.

414
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,757
我以为你回家是干你平时不开心的时候
I thought you came home to do what you usually do

415
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:02,952
经常干的事呢
when you get depressed.

416
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,255
喝醉酒 然后对着台阶上的人竖中指
Get drunk and throw the finger at people from the stoop.

417
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,658
台阶没有 不过我的确是喝醉了
No stoop. But I am drunk.

418
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,493
你以为我清醒的时候能做这种事?
You think I could've done this sober?

419
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,329
我只是觉得 我们身边的事最近那么黑暗
I just figured, with everything around us being so black lately,

420
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,398
我们需要一点粉红色
I thought we needed a little pink.

421
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:16,599
你说得对
You're right. We did.

422
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,234
因为我们的T恤生意是完了
'Cause our t-shirt business is over.

423
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:21,604
我们还得还银行贷款 怎么办?
And we still have to pay off that bank loan. Now what?

424
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:24,373
我们会找到办法的 我们都能成功
We'll figure something out. We always do.

425
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:26,275
嘿 姑娘们 快来
Hey, girls, come quick.

426
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,844
我们要来玩"猜猜Sophie最爱的体位是什么"
We're gonna play "Guess Sophie's Favorite Sex Position"

427
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:31,780
哦!
Whoo!

428
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:35,784
是后背位 还得看着"逍遥法外"
It's on all fours, watching How To Get Away With Murder.

429
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:38,853
看到了吧? 我就说我会赢的
See? I told you I was gonna win.

430
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,026
生活又变黑暗了
And it just got black again.

431
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:45,058
是啊 非常黑暗
Yeah, real black.

432
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:48,933
这是湿的 Max 你已经吃过这个了吗?
This is wet. Max, did you already eat this?

433
00:20:48,934 --> 00:20:51,859
我跟你说我不喜欢草莓糖
I told you I don't like a strawberry centre.

434
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,226
我才不会打自己一顿呢
I am not gonna beat myself up about it.
