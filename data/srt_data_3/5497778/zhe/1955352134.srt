00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,130
這里有幾個小低分  你搶車道了嗎
Couple of minor dings there. You cut someone off in traffic?

145
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,180
是工作上的事
Oh, just a workplace thing.

146
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,830
好  我們看看你的影響力球
Okay. Let's check on your sphere of influence.

147
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,530
我放大一下
Let me zoom out here.

148
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,810
外圍很棒  陌生人喜歡你  這是好事
Great peripherals. Strangers like you, that's a plus.

149
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,610
-內圈也不錯  這很好  -謝謝
- Healthy inner circle. It's good. - Thank you.

150
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,450
是有辦法的  4.5是可以達到的
There's a ways to go, but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

151
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,200
你覺得要多久
How long do you think?

152
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,260
到4.5
To hit 4.5?

153
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,660
除非遭遇重大挫折
Well, barring a major setback,

154
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,790
當眾蒙羞什么的  18個月就行
a public disgrace kind of deal, I'd say 18 months or so.

155
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,760
我需要更快點  快很多
Oh, I need more short term. Like... much more.

156
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,530
那你需要拉分
Then you'll need a boost.

157
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,430
-什么樣的拉分  -這個嘛
- What kind of a boost? - Well...

158
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,140
你大部分交際發生在內圈里
Most of your interactions are confined to your inner circle

159
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,430
而這些人  抱歉  他們大都是中低檔的
and they're largely, pardon the term, mid-to low-range folks.

160
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,900
你的外圈也是
Same with your outer circle.

161
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,330
你有一堆來自

five stars from service industry workers,

163
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,990
但再就沒什么別的了
but there's not much else.

164
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,460
至少在我看來
At least as far as I can see.

165
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,680
從質量上講  你這方面需要提升
So in terms of quality, you could use a punch up right there.

166
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,010
最理想的是來自上等人的高分
Ideally, that's up votes from quality people.

167
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,440
-上等人  -大4分的
- Quality people? - High fours.

168
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,910
如果能打動上等人  你的曲線就會加速上揚
Impress those up-scale folks, you'll gain velocity on your arc

169
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,570
他們能給你拉分
and there's your boost.

170

186
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,740
大4分的人一眼就能看穿  做自己就好
High fours can smell it a mile off. Just be you.

-好  -太棒了
- Well, okay. - Yes!

291
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,730
在這世上
In this world,

292
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,180
我們都太沉浸于自己的小世界
we're all so caught up in our own heads.

293
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,090
很容易忘記什么是真實的
It's easy to lose sight of what's real.

294
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,070
什么是重要的
What matters.

295
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,480
但今天我站在這里
But as I stand here today...

296
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,170
看到保羅給娜奧米的生活帶來的喜悅
seeing the joy Paul has brought to Naomi's life,

297
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,880
我知道她對我真的很重要
I know she's someone who truly matters to me.

298
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,800
娜娜
Nay-Nay,

299
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,510
小時候
the little girl who,

300
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,830
五歲的我們一起去藝術夏令營
when we were just five-years-old in art camp,

301
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,640
她看到我害怕  就來跟我說話
started talking to me because she saw I was scared.

302
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,410
她幫我做了破布先生
The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags.

303
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,480
我還留著呢
I still have him.

304
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,970
它就擺在我桌上
He sits on my desk and...

305
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,590
每天讓我回憶起娜娜
every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay.

306
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,250
記起她那時對我多重要  現在也是
What she meant to me then and now.

307
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,440
能來到這里我非常榮幸
I am so honored to be here

308
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,460
我祝你們
and I wish you

309
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,740
擁有這愚蠢的世界所擁有的一切幸福
all the happiness this stupid world can muster.

310
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,960
我愛你  娜娜
I love you, Nay-Nay.

311
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,860
眼淚太過了嗎
Is the tear too much?

312
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,880
你個反社會
You fucking sociopath.

313
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,290
萊恩  我的車到了  太過了嗎
Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?

314
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,940
眼淚  照片  破布先生
What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?

315
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,570
我的確把它擺在桌上
I do keep him on my desk.

316
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,330
甜蜜是一回事  你這是糖尿病了
There's sugary and then there's fucking diabetes.

317
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,620
我只想在她婚禮這天哄她開心
I just wanna make her happy on her wedding day.

318
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,660
不得不聽你講完的4分圣人給你狂打五星
The captive audience of 4-point holies five-starring your ass off,

319
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,870
只是額外好處
that's just a bonus.

320
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,180
-娜奧米和我曾經是好閨蜜  -得了
- Naomi and I were best friends. - Come on...

321
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,040
我祝她好  并想盡力表達好我的祝福
I wish her well and wanna express it the best I can.

322
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,760
是啊  如果我講得很好
And, yeah, if I nail a speech

323
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,520
被幾百名上等人打了五星
and get five-starred by hundreds of primes,

324
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,100
那又如何  那是雙贏
so what? It's a win-win.

325
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,530
你要多高  4.3  4.4
What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?

326
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,730
你的游戲隊友給你高分  這是一樣的
You get points from your gaming buddies. It's the same thing.

327
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,710
別因為我目標遠大就噴我
Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

328
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,210
鵜鶘灣那么高嗎
Pelican Cove higher?

329
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,030
鵜鶘灣怎么了  那公寓很棒
What's wrong with Pelican Cove? They're great apartments!

330
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,940
那是假笑牢房
They are fake-smile jail cells.

331
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,440
真好  車取消了
Great. Car cancelled.

332
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,410
他還給了我低分
And he marked me down

333
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,940
這下我得再叫輛車  而且還被打了低分
so now I have to book another, and I took a ding.

334
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,600
-干得好  -對不起
- Great job. - I am sorry,

335
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,660
但我想念正常的你了
but I miss the normal you.

336
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,770
你執迷于此之前
Before this obsession,

337
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,030
我們還能好好說話呢  記得嗎
when we had conversations, remember?

338
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,670
我需要我的充電器
I need my charger.

339
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,310
這個分數的事  把你自己跟這些
This whole ranking thing, just comparing yourself to people who--

340
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,530
看到我的充電器了嗎
Have you seen my charger?

341
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,500
假裝快樂的人相比
...only pretend to be happy.

342
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,560
我叫你別拿的
I said don't borrow this!

343
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,470
娜奧米那種大4分的  肯定有自殺傾向
High fours like Naomi, I bet they're suicidal on the inside.

344
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,320
我的車又到了
My car is here. Again.

345
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,570
你的鵜鶘灣保證金  拿得回來嗎
Your Pelican Cove deposit, is it refundable?

346
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,090
如果這沒成功呢
Like, what if this doesn't work?

347
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,060
-你就不能別煩我嗎  -你是我姐姐
- Can't you just stay out of my shit? - You're my sister!

348
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,860
是啊  如果你真在乎  或許就會注意到
Yes! And if you cared about that, maybe you would've noticed

349
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,220
跟你住在一起并不是什么非常愉快的事
living with you hasn't been one big rainbow sandwich for me.

350
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,540
你知道我為什么從不帶人回來嗎
Do you know why I never brought any guys back here?

351
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,900
因為我不希望他們知道
Because I didn't want them to know

352
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,110
我跟一個3分二貨先生
I was sharing a skanky-ass cave

353
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,420
共享一間臭哄哄的公寓
with Mr. Three Point Fuck.

354
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,790
表演順利
Good luck with your performance!

355
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,860
我就來  我就來
I'm coming. I'm coming.

356
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,610
-天吶  -真抱歉
- Jesus Christ! - Oh, I'm so sorry.

357
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,820
{\an8}塔瑪拉

358
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,520
這可好  太好了
That's great. Just great.

359
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,230
{\an8}視頻通話

360
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,720
娜娜
Nay-Nay!

361
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,810
蕾茜  就問問你
Hey, Lace! Just checking in.

362
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,250
我正在趕往機場
I'm on my way to the airport right now.

363
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,150
好啊  你準備好來參加彩排晚宴了吧
Okay, cool, and you're all good for the rehearsal dinner?

364
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,710
是的  要飛一小時左右吧
Oh, yeah. The flight's, what, an hour?

365
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,430
餐廳看上去很不錯
That restaurant looks so cool.

366
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,640
收到裙子了吧
And you got the dress okay?

367
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,050
在我箱子里
In my case.

368
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,590
粉色我喜歡
I love the pink.

369
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,520
講話的最新一稿很棒
So the latest draft of the speech is great.

370
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,650
手寫真酷
Going handwritten's so cool.

371
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,150
我一看掃描件  天吶  都淚涌了
Those scans of the page, my God, I welled up just at that.

372
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,050
-謝謝  -就一點
- Oh, thank you! - Just one thought.

373
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,990
關于你患有飲食失調時我幫了你的事
That whole bit where I help you with the eating disorder thing...

374
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,200
-你覺得有點...  -透露隱私了
- You think that's a little... - A little over-sharing, yeah.

375
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,270
你說得太對了  我刪掉
You're so right. It's gone.

376
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,060
好  那幾小時后見了
Okay. Cool. Well, I'll see you in a few hours!

377
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,940

*I'm getting married tomorrow*

378

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,230
都滿員了
Yeah, they're all kind of full.

386
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,740
這是我幾周前訂好的  是我最好朋友的婚禮
I booked this weeks ago. It's my best friend's wedding.

387
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,080
-對不起  -我必須趕過去
- I'm sorry. - I have to get there. I have to.

388
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,960

一架今晚出發的航班還有個保留位置

是為我們最優航班項目會員預留的

你得超過4.2分才行
You gotta be a 4.2 or over to qualify.

393
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,790
我就是4.2

394
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,200
恐怕你是4.183
I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.

395
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,430
這不能怪我
Well, that's not my fault.

396
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,990
有個女人拉了我的分  你不能...
Some woman dinged me down in the... Can't you just--

397
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,520
對不起  分數不對  我訂不到機票
I'm sorry, it won't let me book it without the correct ranking.

398
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,930
-但就差一點啊  -我也沒辦法
- But it's so close. - There's just nothing I can do.

399
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,780
老天爺  肯定有辦法吧
Christ, I mean, surely.

400
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,700
我需要請您注意用語
I'm gonna have to ask you to moderate your language there.

401
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,290
對不起  我...
Sorry. It's just...

402
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,120
我是伴娘  我不能錯過婚禮

那真是太抱歉了
And I am so sorry about that.

404
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,900
-你能打給你的上級嗎  -不行

405
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,600
-你就打給上級吧  -我不能那么做
- Can you just call the supervisor? - I cannot do that.

-我們對臟話是零容忍的  -對不起
- We're zero tolerance on profanity. - I'm sorry. It's just--

好吧  為了恢復平靜
Okay. So, in order to restore calm,

417
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,010
我要使用作為機場保安的權利
I'm invoking my authority as airport security

418
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,940
給你扣1分  作為懲罰

我們建議你在此期間避免負面反饋

請立刻離開機場
Please, remove yourself from the airport immediately.

兩星
Two stars?

482
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,410
不是什么有意義的偶遇
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

483
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,090

女士  你有K1適配器嗎
Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?

491

You look like you need a ride.

500
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,970
其實  不用了
Actually, I'm okay.

501
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,940
看來需要啊
Don't look it.

502
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,840
來吧  我不咬人
Come on. I don't bite.

503
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,730
路瑟  咖啡太太  赤紅  威士忌  你自便
Luther, Mrs. Coffee, reds, whiskey. Help yourself.

504
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,940
不用  謝謝
I'm okay. Thanks.

505
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,350
你去哪
Where are you headed?

506
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:10,190
盡量靠近瑪麗港就行
Just as close as you can get to Port Mary would be great.

507
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,710
在翻我的信息找危險跡象嗎
Checking my feed for danger signs?

508
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,250
常有人這樣
I get it a lot.

509
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,270
1.4的人肯定是反社會的瘋子  是吧
1.4 gotta be an antisocial maniac, right?

510
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,470
-你似乎  -挺正常
- You seem... - Normal?

511
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,290
-嗯  -謝謝
- Yeah. - Thank you.

512
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,540
還是很費了一番力的  你是怎么了
It took some effort. What happened to you?

513
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:45,210
你2.8  你看上去可不像2.8的
I mean, you're a 2.8, but you don't look 2.8.

514
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,830
那是...暫時的
That's not-- This is temporary.

515
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,890
我回扭轉過來的
I'm gonna turn it around.

516
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,460
我要去參加婚禮
I'm going to a wedding.

517
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,550
-我是伴娘  -不錯啊
- Maid of honour. - Nice.

518
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,090
想聽聽我的講話嗎
Wanna hear my speech?

519
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,940
不想
No.

520
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,760
你怎么落到2.8的
So how come you're a 2.8?

521
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,180
我因為在機場大吼被扣分了
Well, I got marked down at the airport for yelling,

522
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,190
他們還給我開了低分翻倍
and they put me on double damage.

523
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,070
-感覺怎么樣  -很糟
- How did it feel? - Awful.

524
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,560
我是說大吼
I meant the yelling.

525
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,690
我不知道  我當時生著氣
I don't know. I was mad.

526
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,160
瞧我落得什么下場
Look at where it got me.

527
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,130
但只要我趕到婚禮  講了話
But as long as I get to the wedding, do the speech,

528
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,850
他們不會在意我是2.8的
they'll overlook the 2.8.

529
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:27,930
我是新娘的朋友
I'm with the bride.

530
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,790
如果我做得好  他們都是大4分的
And if I do well, well, they're all high fours

531
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,290
會迅速拉高我的分數
so that velocitates my arc.

532
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,250
等罰分解除
And once they lift the point penalty,

533
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,080
我的平均分就會上去
well, my average goes way up,

534
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,870
那就沒事了
and, yeah, it's gonna be okay.

535
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,040
天吶  你讓我想起了自己
God, you remind me of me.

536
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,570
不是現在
Not now.

537
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,390
我曾經是4.6分
I was, uh... 4.6 once.

538
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,780
-4.6  -以前視此為生命
- 4.6? - Used to live for it.

539
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,110
我付出了那么多努力
All the work I put in...

540
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,040
八年前  湯姆  我丈夫得了癌癥
Eight years ago, Tom, my husband, got cancer.

541
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,300
胰腺癌  非常討厭
It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.

542
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,010
癥狀出現得很晚
The symptoms showed up late.

543
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,370
我很遺憾
I'm so sorry.

544
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,130
你并不認識我  所以不會怎么遺憾
You don't know me so you're not really sorry.

545
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,810
你主要是覺得尷尬
You're just mainly awkward

546
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,590
因為我突然對你談起了癌癥
cos I have sprung some cancer talk at you.

547
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,900
總之  我給每個醫生  護士
Anyway, I five-starred every doctor,

548
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,880
大4分的會診醫生都打了五星
every nurse, every high-four consultant that we had.

549
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,380
非常感謝
Thank you so much.

550
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,400
但癌癥才不在乎  它還是繼續擴散
The cancer didn't give a shit. It just kept growing.

551
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,170
幾個月后
A couple of months in,

552
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,990
我們聽說了一個實驗治療
we heard about this experimental treatment.

553
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:43,120
非常昂貴  而且不好進
It was very expensive. It was very exclusive.

554
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,060
為了幫他爭取位置我想盡了辦法
I did everything I could to get him a spot there.

555
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,460
湯姆是4.3
Tom was a 4.3.

556
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,900
他們把他的位置給了個4.4的
They gave his bed to a 4.4.

557
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,280
所以他死后  我想  去他的
So when he died I thought, fuck it.

558
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,530
我開始隨時隨心所欲地說話
I started saying what I wanted, when I wanted.

559
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,220
就那么沖口而出
Just drop it out there.

560
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,820
人們并不總喜歡我這樣
People don't always like that.

561
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,870
你一開始這么做  分數嗖嗖下滑
It is incredible how fast you slip off the ladder

562
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,430
簡直難以置信
when you start doing that.

563
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,360
原來很多我的朋友并不喜歡誠實
It turned out a lot of my friends didn't care for honesty.

564
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:31,740
他們對我就好像我在他們早餐桌上拉了屎
Treated me like I had taken a shit at their breakfast table.

565
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,660
但是  那感覺真妙
But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

566
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,490
擺脫那些混蛋
Shedding those fuckers.

567
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,110
就像脫掉一雙擠腳的鞋
It was like taking off tight shoes.

568
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,410
-或許你也該試試  -得了
- Maybe you should try it? - Oh, come on.

569
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,660
為什么不呢
Why not?

570
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,930
我不能就踢掉鞋子到處走
I can't just kick off my shoes and walk the earth or whatever.

571
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,980
-你不試怎么知道  -那是...
- You won't know unless you try. - Oh, that's just...

572
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,720
你生命中曾有一些
Look, you had something with your life,

573
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,280
真實  美好的東西  你全部失去了
real things, good things, and you lost it all,

574
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,620
我很遺憾
and I'm sorry.

575
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,330
你現在沒什么可失去的了
So now you've got nothing left to lose.

576
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,160
但我都沒有值得失去的東西呢
But I don't even have the something worth losing, not yet.

577
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,990
我還在為那個奮斗
You know, I mean, I'm still fighting for that.

578
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,650
"那個"是什么
And what is "that"?

579
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:25,240
我不知道  讓我知足的東西
I don't know. Enough to be content?

580
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,550
能環顧四周  然后想
Like, to look around and think,

581
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,220
我混得不錯
well, I guess I'm okay.

582
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,850
能夠自如呼吸  不會覺得...
Just to be able to breathe out, not feeling like... like...

583
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,450
就是...
Like just...

584
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,160
那還差得很遠呢
And that is way off, like, way, way off.

585
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,980
我做到那個境界之前
And until I get there,

586
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,210
我還得遵守分數游戲的規則
I have to play the numbers game.

587
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,400
我們都得  我們就活在這種世界里
We all do, that's what we're in.

588
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,940
這世界就他媽是這個規矩
That's how the fucking world works.

589
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,590
或許你不記得了
Look, maybe you don't remember,

590
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,900
你年紀太大了  不懂了
you know, you're just too old to get it.

591
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,170
我不是那個意思
I do not mean that how it sounds.

592
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,830
別擔心  我不會給你低分的
Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.

593
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,680
親愛的
Sweetheart.

594
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,040
幾點了
What time is it?

595
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,660
我之后要向東了
I'm heading east from here

596
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,330
你得再搭輛車了
so I think you need to get yourself another ride.

597
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,640
-我們在哪  -離瑪麗港還有30英里
- Where are we? - About 30 miles from Port Mary.

598
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,000
這里有很多大巴站  你應該沒問題了
A lot of buses stop here so you should be fine.

599
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,430
-謝謝你  -講話順利
- Well, thank you. - Good luck with your speech.

600
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,180
我給你放了點東西進去
I put a little something in there for you.

601
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,310
-是嗎  -緊急出口
- You did? - Emergency escape hatch!

602
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,450
再見
Bye.

603
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,640
在這世上  我們都太沉浸于
In this world, we're all so caught up...

604
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,930
自己的小世界
...in our own dramas.

605
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,180
-爸爸還說  -很容易忘記什么是重要的
- So, Dad was like... - It's easy to forget what matters.

606
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,360
他沒聽過那個節目
He'd never even heard of the show.

607
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,680
我說  "你沒聽過《靜海》"
I'm like, "You never heard of Sea of Tranquillity?"

608
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,460
那是排名第一的科幻片
Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy,

609
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,760
他說  "什么鬼"  隨便了
and he's all like, "What the fuck?" Whatever!

610
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,560
我覺得我對這紫色過敏
I think I'm allergic to this purple.

611
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,020
我就說  "我要去瑪麗港的靜海大會
So I'm like, "Well, I'm going to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary.

612
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,320
所以才扮成了達斯特中尉"
That's why I'm dressed like Lieutenant Duster."

613
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,810
他說  "瑪麗港那么老遠"
He's all like, "Uh... Port Mary is frickin' miles away."

614
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,630
然后給了我1星   謝了  老爸
He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.

615
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:50,760
{\an8}搜索結果

616
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,650

618
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,680
-你也喜歡《靜海》  -當然
- You're into Sea of Tranquillity? - Totally.

619
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,080
我打算去的
I was all set to go.

620
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,610
我朋友已經到了
My friend, who is there already,

621
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:13,130
我的服裝在她那兒  但我的車壞了
has my costume, but my car broke down.

622
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,300
房車里還有地方
Well, there's some space in the RV.

623
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,470
-你是個靜粉吧  -什么
- You're a Trank head, huh? - Sorry?

624
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,950
靜粉  《靜海》粉絲
Trank head. Sea of Tranquillity fan?

625
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,450
是啊  我們那邊叫海粉的
Oh, yeah. We say Tranksters where I'm from.

626
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,290
-你最喜歡的人物是誰  -達斯特中尉吧
- Who's your favourite character? - Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

627
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,120
-她太棒了  -她
- She's awesome. - She?

628
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,390
他  我口誤
He! I misspoke.

629
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,110
達斯特中尉沒有固定性別
Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.

630
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,530
是啊  所以才不容易記住
I know, and that's why it's so hard to remember, right?

631
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,530
失陪  我得接一下
Excuse me. Gotta get this.

632

636
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:04,830

Don't come.

637
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,030
什么  不不  我就差一小時的路了
What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away.

638

別來了  我不要你來
Don't come. I don't want you here.

639

我不知道你是怎么回事
I don't know what is up with you,

640
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,860
但我不能讓2.6的人出現在我的婚禮上
but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding.

641
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,070
不  那是暫時的  暫時的
Oh, no, that's temporary! That's temporary.

642
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,360
婚禮就在今天了
Well, the wedding's today so...

643
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,000
-這并不能改變什么  -蕾茜
- But it doesn't change anything. - Lacie...

644
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,160
-我還是可以講話的  -蕾茜
- I can still do the same speech. - Lacie...

645
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,170
-還有破布先生  -不行
- And there's Mr. Rags! - No!

646
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,000
但是  你邀請我了
But... But you invited me.

647
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,860
你看過賓客名單了  他們都4.5以上
You've seen the guest list. They are all, like, 4.5 or above.

648
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,850
你個2.6會格格不入
They are going to freak at a 2.6,

649
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,340
我不要那樣的負面影響
and I am not taking that kind of damage,

650
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,300
再說  我都六個月沒低于過4.7了
plus I haven't dipped under a 4.7 in, like, six months.

651
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,850
你說你希望你最久的朋友去的
You said you wanted your oldest friend.

652
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,090
我叫你來講話時  你是4.2
When I asked you to speak, you were a 4.2, okay?

653
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,350
我們進行過各種模擬  在這種規模的集會上
And the authenticity of a vintage bond low four

654
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,450
跟小4分的陳年友誼的真實性
at a gathering of this calibre

655
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,440
會產生非常好的效果
played fantastically on all the stimulations we ran.

656
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,140
據預測至少能提高.2分
Forecast was a prestige bounce of .2 minimum.

657
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,260
但現在你低于3了  對不起
But now you're a sub three. Sorry.

658
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,320
這就太不討喜了
That just puts the stink on things a little too much.

659
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,650
對我們不會有利
That just plays badly for us.

660
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,040
你只在乎分數嗎
So it was just about numbers for you?

661
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,180
少來了  我們都一樣
Oh, cut the shit! It was numbers for both of us.

662
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,130
你想要上等人的高分  別否認了
You wanted those primo votes, don't deny it.

663
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,520
你憑自己又得不到
It's not like you could get them on your own.

664
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,050
我們就別自欺欺人了
Let's not kid ourselves.

665
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,510
我會得到高分的
Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.

666
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:21,010
怎么  你打算就跑過來逼人喜歡你嗎
What? You're just gonna roll up here and make people like you?

667
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,680
-沒錯  我要做我的講話  -你不能
- That's right. I'm doing my speech. - No, you're not.

668
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,770
我就要
Yes, I am.

669
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:29,800
等他們聽了  會給我打高分的
And they are gonna vote me through the roof when they hear it.

670
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,010
會把眼淚流干
Weep their fucking eyes out!

671
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,110
回家去吧
Go home!

672
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,160
喂
Hello?

673
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:40,790
操
Fuck!

674
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,570
我從沒看過你們的破電視劇
I have never seen your stupid fucking show.

675
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,800
希望它被砍
Hope they cancel it!

676
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,510
我需要搭車
I need a ride!

677
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,560
操
Fuck!

678
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,800
天吶

-能借你的摩托嗎  -什么
- Can I borrow your bike? - What?

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,280
能借你的摩托嗎
Can I borrow your bike?

681

你  娜奧米·杰恩·布萊斯托
Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,

682

是否愿與此人結為夫婦

我叫蕾茜·龐德
my name is Lacie Pound

726
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,110
信不信由你  我是娜奧米最久的朋友之一
and, believe it or not, I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

727
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,940
娜娜
Hi, Nay-Nay!

728
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,380
也很高興認識你  保羅
It's great to meet you too, Paul.

729
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,030
聽說了你不少好事
I've heard a lot about you.

730
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,990
他可是個大人物  那個保羅
He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

731
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,540
大人物啊
Pretty big deal.

732
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:28,460
他會自己做橄欖醬  沒錯
He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.

733
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,680
總之
Anyway, um... I...

734
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:40,920
我這輩子一直敬仰娜奧米
have looked up to Naomi pretty much my entire life.

735
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,620
我們五歲時相識
We met when we were five years old,

736
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,530
一直到十幾歲都是朋友
and right up through to our teenage years,

737
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,300
是一對兒好姐妹
we made quite the pair.

738
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,980
我們會聊各種閨蜜間的話題
We'd talk about all the things girls talk about,

739
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:54,300
男孩  頭發  商品
you know, boys, hair, products,

740
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,210
還有男孩
more boys.

741
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,240
我有時會想擴展一下話題
I mean, I tried sometimes to expand our range a little

742
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,400
聊聊氣候變化
and talk about climate change,

743
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,070
但她覺得那無聊  所以
but she found that kind of boring so...

744
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,460
去啊
Go on.

745
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,660
她可能是對的  去他的地球  是吧
She was probably right. I mean, fuck the planet, right?

746
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,670
謝謝  來吧  讓氣氛活躍一點
Yes, thank you! Come on. Let's have a little fun here.

747
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,630
去他的地球
You know, fuck the planet!

748
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,190
去他的地球
Fuck the planet!

749
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,870
{\an8}已打分  蕾茜  1星

750
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,840
總之
Anyway...

751
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,080
我這輩子
I... looked up

752
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,660
一直敬仰娜奧米
to Naomi pretty much my entire life,

753
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,630
所以她一直在俯視我
which meant she was looking down on me.

754
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,940
但總是面帶微笑的
Always with a smile though.

755
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:47,470
高中時  她是讓我哭泣的肩膀
In high school, she was my shoulder to cry on.

756
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:49,810
她似乎很喜歡那樣
She seemed to enjoy that.

757
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:53,150
我總沒有男人緣
Guys and me never worked out.

758
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:56,270
他們一看到娜奧米就...
They'd see Naomi and just...

759
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,640
我就沒戲了
You know, that was it.

760
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:03,940
她屁股緊翹
She had this tight ass,

761
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:07,430
就像拳頭
like two fists.

762
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,290
我就...
I was all like...

763
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,560
我...
I was like...

764
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,440
穿過高中的走廊
through the hallways in high school.

765
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,370
她一直陪著我
And she was there for me.

766
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,550
替我抓著頭發
Holding my hair back...

767
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:50,850
讓我跪在馬桶前吐
as I knelt, vomiting, in front of the crapper.

768
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,560
謝謝了  娜奧米
Thank you for that, Naomi.

769
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:04,230
我一直希望自己是你
I always wished I was you.

770
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,210
而且
And...

771
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,400
這才是你留了我那么久的原因吧
I guess that's why you kept me around so long?

772
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:17,130
直到你找到了新工作
Until you got your new job

773
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:22,200
和厲害的新朋友
and your fancy new friends.

774
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,880
還有那個
And that...

775
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,620
他媽的
...fucking...

776
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,140
混球
jackhole!

777
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:36,150
你不需要我了  你可能又找了個新我
And you didn't need me. You probably got another me.

778
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,920
大概有個
Guess there's some other

779
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:41,320
新可憐人被你個妖女盯上了
"Yeth Beth" you moved on to like a succubus.

780
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,260
我這就說到破布先生  好嗎  天吶
I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!

781
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,020
別過來
Stay back.

782
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:52,370
別他媽過來  要不我殺了它
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

783
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,310
我會砍下它的頭  塞進我屁股里
I'll cut his head off and stick it up my ass!

784
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,910
時間就要到了
Time's nearly up!

785
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,780
-冷靜下來  -我
- Calm down. - I...

786
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,750
我想說  在這世上
I just wanted to say, in this world

787
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,580
我們都太沉浸于自己的破事
we all so caught up in our own shit,

788
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,860
-不要忘記什么才是重要的  -沒事的
- let's not forget what matters. - It's okay. It's okay.

789
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,260
幸福
Happiness,

790
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:15,550
他媽的保羅和娜奧米
fucking Paul and Naomi, and she's...

791
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,990
她
She...

792
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:20,240
她上了格雷戈
She fucked Greg!

793
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,710
我知道她上過他
I know she did.

794
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:27,890
-我知道你干了  -沒有
- I know you did. - No...

795
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,390
別想否認
Don't even try to deny--

796
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,330
小時候
The little girl who,

797
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,890
五歲的我們一起去藝術夏令營
when we were just five-years-old in art camp,

798
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,630
她看到我害怕  就來跟我說話
started talking to me because she saw I was scared

799
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,780
她幫我做了破布先生
and helped me make Mr. Rags.

800
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,950
它讓我回憶起你  記起你那時對我多重要
He reminds me of you and what you meant to me then!

801
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:54,190
我很榮幸能來這里見證這破玩意
And I'm so honoured to be here to see this shit!

802
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:57,410
我愛你  娜娜
I love you, Nay-Nay!

803
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,110
我一直都愛你
I've always loved you!

804
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,790
我愛你
I love you!

805
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,720
你他媽看什么呢
What the fuck are you looking at?

806
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,250
我也在想呢
Just what I was wondering.

807
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:53,690
好吧
Well...

808
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,860
別
Don't!

809
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,360
別什么  別想嗎
Don't? Don't wonder?

810
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,360
不想這世界會很沉悶
It would be a dull world without wonder.

811
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,510
我才不在乎你的世界
I don't give a shit about your world.

812
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,800
我不喜歡你的胸罩
I don't like your brassiere.

813
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,570
我不喜歡你的小胡子
I don't like your moustache.

814
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,750
我不喜歡你的氣場
I don't like your aura.

815
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,060
-我的氣場  -嗯
- My aura? - Yeah.

816
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,300
我不喜歡你的...
I don't like your...

817
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,020
頭  你整個頭我都覺得可笑
head. Your entire head is just ridiculous to me.

818
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,160
是嗎
Really?

819
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,710
你就像
You look like

820
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:36,100
酗酒的前天氣預報員
an alcoholic former weatherman.

821
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,710
你就像只迷途羔羊
You sound like a lost little lamb

822
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,480
剛得知了這世上沒有圣誕老人
that just got told there's no Santa Claus.

823
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:45,000
你媽媽是干了哪個卡通人物
What sort of cartoon character did your mum have to fuck

824
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,900
才懷上你的
to brew you up in the womb?

825
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,570
至少我看上去像生出來的
At least I look like I was born,

826
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,200
不是被地下實驗室里
not shit out by some

827
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,170
哪只被受折磨的奶牛怪拉出來的
tormented cow creature in an underground lab.

828
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,890
你被從那個實驗室里丟了出來
You got tossed out of that lab.

829
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,740
-是嗎  -是啊  沖出來的
- Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah, flushed out.

830

生物撞車
biological car crash

834
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,090
畢加索都覺得辣眼睛
that made Picasso screw his eyes up and say,

835
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:12,030
說  "這是什么玩意嘛"
"Well, that just don't make sense."

836
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,970
-你是個他媽的混蛋  -去你媽
- You're a fucking asshole. - Fuck you!
