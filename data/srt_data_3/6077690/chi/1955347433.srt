和女朋友同居?

00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,224
这件事有点复杂啊
That's a great deal to process.

4
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:06,768
嗯?
Hmm?

5
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:08,369
就五个星期而已
It's only for five weeks.

6
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,670
让我用科学理论来说服你
Let me appeal to the scientist in you.

7
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:11,705
既然我们只有五周的期限
Given the five-week end date,

8
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:14,675
不如刚好把这看作是一个实验
isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment

9
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:16,744
用来收集有关我们兼容性的数据
and collect data on our compatibility?

10
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:19,847
别想用这种甜言蜜语诱惑我
Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.

11
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:21,515
好啵
Okay.

12
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:22,983
"星际迷航 初代"里
Star Trek: The Original Series.

13
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:24,852
企业号有一个探索新世界的任务
The Enterprise was on a five-year mission

14
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:25,986
就是为期五年的
to explore new worlds.

15
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:27,187
你就把同居当做是
Think of this as your personal

16
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:29,590
你自己的探索新世界任务 为期五周
five-week mission to do the same.

17
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:34,061
你看 这种甜言蜜语才能吸引到我
Oh, you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it.

18
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:35,696
不如你们去对面住
Okay, why don't you guys stay across the hall

19
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:37,431
我们住这边
and we will live here?

20
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:40,567
很好 我同意了
Very well. I'm on board.

21
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:42,102
- 真的吗?  - 是的
- Seriously?  - Yes.

22
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:43,637
我接受这个为期五周的
I accept this five-week mission

23

与我女朋友分享居住空间的任务
to share a living space with my girlfriend.

24
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:46,974
哦 这太让人激动了
Oh. This is so exciting.

25
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:49,009
不要太惊讶 星际迷航里的任务
Well, now, don't be surprised if, like Star Trek,

26
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:52,346
在第三部就结束了
it's canceled in three.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,555
{\an8}现在

28
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:56,317
我有点犯晕
Okay, I'm confused.

29
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:57,785
机器人先生是哪一个?
Which one is Mr. Robot?

30
00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:59,219
我给你个提示
I'll give you a hint.

31
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:01,722
我们现在看的是超胆侠
We're watching Daredevil.

32
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:05,225
能麻烦你俩告诉Amy
Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy

33
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:07,561
严格执行卫生间时间表有多享受吗?
adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?

34
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:08,595
- 做不到  - 我不干
- Can't.  - Won't.

35
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:09,830
- 一点不享受  - 不享受
- Didn't.  - Don't.

36
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:11,098
我告诉过你了
I told you,

37
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,901
你不可能控制生活的方方面面
you can't regulate every aspect of our lives.

38
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:17,671
可能啊 只要你能俯首甘受命运就好
I can if you'd just roll over and accept your fate.

39
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:20,140
很抱歉把矛盾带到了这里
I'm sorry for bringing this over here.

40
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:21,842
信我吧 我特别了解你俩现在的感受

而且我... 我们能传授的最好方法就是
And I... I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is

42
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:25,666
不要反悔
no backsies.

43
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:28,816
Sheldon 我特别理解
Sheldon, I understand

44
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:30,250
你喜欢让所有东西整齐排放的心情
that you like things a certain way

45
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:31,919
我也愿意做出让步
and I'm willing to make some concessions,

46
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,321
但是你也得学会妥协让步
but you have to be open to compromise.

47
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:35,823
她说得对 这很合理
She's right. That's reasonable.

48
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:37,624
看看谁才是最大的妥协家
Oh, look who's in favor of compromise,

49
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:41,028
和Leonard Hofstadter结婚的女人
the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.

50
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,263
嘿 她才没有妥协
Hey, she didn't compromise.

51
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:45,933
她只是定下心了 这是有区别的
She settled. There's a difference.

52
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:49,203
说得对 宝贝
Yeah. You tell him, babe.

我们想天黑之前赶到

棒极了... 任何地方只要女人的人数
It's terrific. I... I really thrive anywhere

和温度数上了90... 都能让我生机勃发

如果想看大汗淋漓的老人家的话

她想在宝宝出生之前

78
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:46,520
多花点时间过二人世界
before the baby comes.

00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,923
那你这会儿还在这儿买漫画书?
So then what are you doing here buying comic books?

80

他想在宝宝出生之前
Well, he wants us to spend more time together

81
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:53,461
多花点时间过二人世界
before the baby comes.

82
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:57,932
和别人住一块 就一定会有冲突
When you live with someone, there's gonna be conflict.

83

你们得保持沟通
You just have to keep communicating.

84
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,369
我愿意沟通
I'm open to that.

85
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:04,872
好啊 首先
Okay. Well, for starters,

86
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:07,408
把我俩的牙刷放在同一个牙刷架里
there's nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes

87
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,109
根本没有什么大不了的
in the same holder.

88
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:12,513
Sheldon 你什么想法?
Sheldon, what do you say to that?

我觉得我们还是再找另一半吧

作为一个男性 我具有让我的DNA永垂不朽的
Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive

92
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:23,190
进化学意义上的驱动力
to perpetuate my DNA.

93
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:26,927
让我只和一个伴侣在一起是违背我天性的
Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.

94
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,297
我们一年睡一次!
We sleep together once a year!

95
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,833
你这就想找别的姑娘了?
You want other partners?

96
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:35,769
别怪我 怪你的小伙伴 生物学吧
Don't blame me. Blame your pal, biology.

97
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,305
他才是在幕后捣乱的怪物
He's the pervert pulling the strings here.

98
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:41,853
你想找别人? 那找去吧
You wanna see other people? Go see other people.

99
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,613
我希望那位最好是猴子 这里的猴戏精彩多了
I hope one of those people is a monkey, 'cause this is bananas.

100
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,556
你可以开玩笑 但是再这么发展下去
You can make jokes, but if this keeps up,

101
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:49,763
他就要搬回来了
he's gonna move back in here.

102
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,552
好吧 咱们让他俩分开待一会儿吧
All right. Well, let's just get them apart for a while

103
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:52,566
这样比较能冷静下来
so they can cool down.

104
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,455
好的
Good.

105
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:55,022
然后在他俩再见面之前
Then before we reintroduce them,

106
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,223
我会让他嗅一嗅她的毛衣
we'll give him one of her sweaters

107
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,726
这样他就能重新熟悉她的味道了
so he can get used to her scent again.

108
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:02,329
所以你才有资格开玩笑?
So it's okay for you to joke around?

109
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:03,931
不是玩笑 Howard从太空回来的时候
No, that's actually what we did with him

110
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,066
我们就是这么干的
when Howard came back from space.

111
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:10,604
宝贝 你还好吗?
Honey, how ya feeling?

112
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:16,744
书上说在怀孕的这个阶段
The book says at this stage of the pregnancy

113
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:19,079
晨吐的症状会渐渐消失
morning sickness should be going away.

114
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:26,020
这是个好消息 对不?
So that's good news, right?

115
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:29,757
现在除了你 更让人讨厌的就是那本书了!
The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book!

116
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:37,064
看看你呀!
There she is!

117
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:39,967
准备好迎接通往沙漠又热气腾腾的
Who's ready for a hot,

118
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:43,404
三小时车程了吗?
three-hour car ride to the desert?

119
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:46,907
我下一次会吐在你大腿上
Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.

120
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,577
对不起
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:51,545
我们也不是非得去呀
We don't have to go.

122
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:53,747
但是这是我俩单独度假的
But it's our last chance to take a vacation

123
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:56,016
最后一次机会了
that's just the two of us.

124
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:58,185
不如我们就待在这儿吧?
How 'bout we stay here?

125
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,887
我们不用告诉别人
We don't even have to tell anyone.

126
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,923
来一次秘密家中度假
It'll be like a secret vacation at home.

127
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:05,427
向朋友们保密...
Keeping secrets from our friends...

128
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:07,528
这听起来还挺有趣啊
that does sound kinda fun.

129
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,831
听起来不... 性感吗?
Does it sound... sexy?

130
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:19,073
你刚刚都听到我吐了
You just heard me throwing up.

131
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:22,409
一点没错
You bet I did.

132
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,051
你真是太奇怪了
You're so weird.

133
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,087
你知道什么更奇怪吗?
You know what's weird?

134
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,893
你现在有没有欲火焚身
How turned on you are right now.

135
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:44,431
大家总是指责和我同住
You know, people are quick to accuse me

136
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,833
很困难
of being difficult to live with,

137
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:48,535
但是事实上 Amy和我一样难搞
but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.

138
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:50,938
一样难搞
Just as challenging.

139
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,106
是啊

140
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:54,908
和你一样
As you.

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,276
没错
Yes.

142
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:59,079
跟你一样难搞?
Just as challenging as you.

143
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:02,449
睡觉时
When we're sleeping,

144
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,884
她对着我呼吸喘气
she breathes on me.

145
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:06,220
有天晚上 我实在受不了 差点带上老婆孩子狗
One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto

146
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:08,656
躲进防风地窖了
and headed for the storm cellar.

147
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,658
Leonard也对着我呼吸
Leonard breathes on me, too.

148
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,226
这没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

149
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:14,061
她总是在吐槽她的同事
She's always complaining about people at work.

150
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,729
Leonard也是啊
Well, so does Leonard.

151
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:17,564
是有点烦人 但死不了
It's kind of annoying, but it's not the end of the world.

152
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,333
你知道吗? 我洗完澡出来的时候
Do you know that when I get out of the shower,

153
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:22,936
她跟看猪肉一样上下打量我
she eyes me up and down like I'm a piece of meat?

154
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:24,171
Leonard也这样
You know, so does Leonard.

155
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,472
早上我梳妆打扮完的时候
Can't I just get ready in the morning

156
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:27,341
他能不能不要跟傻子一样竖大拇指?
without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up?

157
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:28,742
"嘿"
"Hey."

158
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:31,445
我懂你
I know.

159
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,547
有时候我更希望别人能看到我的内在美
Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.

160
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:36,950
同意! 太对了!
Agreed! Thank you!

161
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:41,855
好舒服
That feels great.

162
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:43,190
当然
Well,

163
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,758
从你耳朵里变出一个硬币
pulling a quarter out of your ear

164
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,695
可不是这双手唯一会的魔术
isn't the only magic these hands can do.

165
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:51,231
这...这是什么
In fact, wh...what's this

166
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:54,468
藏在你的脚趾里?!
between your toes?!

167
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,338
你能不能消停两分钟 不要我身上变出钱?
Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes?

168
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,746
这是前门的声音吗?
Was that the front door?

169
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:07,748
听起来好像是
It sounded like it.

170
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,451
天啊 有人进来了
Oh, my God. Someone's in the house.

171
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,653
锁门 快锁门!
Lock the door, lock the door!

172
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:16,356
- 我们得报警  - 对...
- We should call the police.  - Uh...

173
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:18,125
我手机放楼下了
I left my phone downstairs.

174
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,660
该死 我的也是
Damn, so did I.

175
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:21,528
我有ipad! 怎么办
Wait, I have my iPad! What are we gonna do,

176
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,797
给911发电子邮件吗?
E-mail 911?

177
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,466
你只会帮倒忙!
That's not helpful!

178
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:26,467
你知道我的
You know I rely

179
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:28,335
一紧张就想讲笑话
on humor in times of stress.

180
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:30,904
那讲之前提醒一声 因为真的不好笑!
Let me know when you start, because that wasn't funny!

181
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:36,844
是浴池的声音吗?
Is that the hot tub?

182
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,180
谁会用我们的浴池?
Who would use our hot tub?

183
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,585
说出来你可能会更慌 或者
Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing

184
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:46,353
不那么慌
than you think.

185
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:47,454
是谁?
Who is it?

186
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:48,622
是Stuart
Stuart.

187
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:54,428
他听见我说我们要出门
He heard me talking about us going away.

188
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,965
可能就不请自来了吧?
I guess he decided to invite himself over?

189
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,833
我们要跟他说点什么吗?
Should we say something to him?

190
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:01,935
要吧
Maybe. How 'bout,

191
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:06,473
"嘿 你看起来像一块水煮鸡胸肉" 怎么样?
"Hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast"?

192
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:10,144
我是指 "你在这干嘛?" 这类的问题
I meant like, "What are you doing here?"

193
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:13,514
不 这样伤不到他
Nah, that's not gonna hurt his feelings.

194
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:17,017
为什么他处处挑剔?
Why is nothing easy with him?

195
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:21,288
听着 关于Shledon 你要明白一件事
Look, here's the thing you need to understand about Sheldon:

196
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,757
他最难相处
he's the worst.

197
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,994
我希望时间和精力就能解决这个问题
I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.

198
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:28,929
我还希望我一米八呢
I prefer to think of myself as five-ten,

199
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:31,198
还不是每条裤子都要卷裤腿
but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.

200
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,902
我早该知道他是这种人的
I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.

201
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:36,370
不要灰心丧气
Don't beat yourself up.

202
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:38,372
你从来没跟别人同居过
You've never lived with anyone before.

203
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:40,374
- 这倒是  - 第一次同居
- That's true.  - And you're starting out

204
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:42,376
还是跟Sheldon Cooper
with Sheldon Cooper.

205
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:45,045
这就像第一次养宠物就养了...
That's like getting your first pet and having it be...

206
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:47,047
我不知道...
I don't know...

207
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:50,317
哪种宠物会毁了你的生活?
What's a kind of pet that ruins your life?

208
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,853
你这样只会让我更难受
You're not making me feel better.

209
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:55,622
即使是我和Penny 刚开始同居时 
Look, even when Penny and I started living together,

210
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,357
也会有一个...一个磨合过程
there was a...a learning curve.

211
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,993
但相信我 情况会变好的
But I promise you, it does get easier.

212
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:01,929
他在浴室贴了一个牌子 上面写着 
He put a sign up in the bathroom that says,

213
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:05,899
"香皂上没有Amy头发的天数"
"Number of days without Amy's hair on the soap."

214
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:08,268
我懂
Yeah.

215
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,305
我的记录是6天
My record was six.

216
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:15,475
是我有问题 还是说
Is it me, or is there something fun

217
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:17,711
看他浮在那里真的很好玩?
about watching him just float there?

218
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:23,183
可能这就是人们养金鱼的原因吧
Maybe this is why people get fish tanks.

219
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:27,087
谁把门廊灯打开了?
Who just turned the porch lights on?

220
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,256
还有别人?
Is someone else here?

221
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:34,628
他们一定是忘了关掉浴池
Hmm. They must have left the tub on.

222
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,463
还好我来了
Good thing I stopped by.

223
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:53,580
哇!
Ah!

224
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:10,456
你在这干嘛?!
What are you doing here?!

225
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,299
你又在这干嘛?!
What are you doing here?!

226
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:17,312
也许Howard和Bernadette说我可以来!
Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here!

227
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,248
他们真的这么说过?
Did they?

228
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,950
回答我的问题！你在这干嘛?!
Answer the question! What are you doing here?!

229
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:25,754
我今晚没事干
I had nothing else to do tonight.

230
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:27,256
过去几个月
The last couple of months,

231
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:29,625
知道他们不在家我就会过来
I come here when I know they're not home.

232
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:30,659
什么?!
What?!

233
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:32,194
有一次我躲在树丛里
They heard me in the bushes once,

234
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,430
但他们以为是只浣熊
but they thought it was a raccoon.

235
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:38,233
我就说浣熊不会喊 "哎哟"
I told you raccoons don't say "Uh-oh."

236
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,839
有天晚上 Leonard呼噜声超大
You know, one night, Leonard's nose whistled so loud,

237
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:47,009
我就像睡在了铁轨上
I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.

238
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,800
你有没有注意到他的呼噜声总是降A调?
Have you noticed it's always an A-flat?

239
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,313
是吗?
Is it?

240
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,349
好像他现在就在车里打呼一样
It's like his sinuses are right here in the car.

241
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:57,519
如果我们要继续这样漫无目的地开下去
If we're just going to drive around aimlessly,

242
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:59,755
至少你可以带我去买个冰淇淋
the least you could do is take me for ice cream.

243
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:01,423
好 我带你去买
Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.

244
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,059
看吧 为什么Amy就不能像这样听我话?
Well, see, why can't Amy be that subservient?

245
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:07,896
{\an8}女权主义领导者

246
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:07,896
我们交媾过一次 她就以为自己是Gloria Steinem了
She has coitus one time, suddenly she's Gloria Steinem.

247
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,600
反正 我想冰淇淋店应该
Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlor will be a good place

248
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:12,968
是个跟女孩子搭讪的好地方
to meet other women.

249
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,736
拜托 你连跟一个人发生肉体关系的
Oh, please, you're barely interested

250
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,405
兴趣都没有
in a physical relationship with one person.

251
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:20,275
为什么还要去祸害别人?
Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?

252
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:24,112
跟Amy在一起已经唤醒了我潜藏的性欲
Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within.

253
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:27,449
看到街上的漂亮妞
When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think,

254
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:30,452
我也会跟其他男人一样浮想联翩
"hubba hubba" like any other guy.

255
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:33,555
你要用这张嘴亲你妈妈?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

256
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:34,823
你开心就好
'Cause it's fine.

257
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,528
给你
Here you go.

258
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,730
谢谢
Thank you.

259
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,700
我们敬个酒吧?
Shall we toast?

260
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:47,169
致Howard和Bernadette
To Howard and Bernadette,

261
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:50,372
还有他们一直没要回去的钥匙
and the house key they never asked me to return.

262
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,909
你说你拿回来了
You said you got it back.

263
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:57,346
很明显 我说谎了
Well, clearly, I lied.

264
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,282
你公寓怎么样?
So how's your apartment?

265
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:02,284
不怎么样 断电了
Not great. The electricity's out.

266
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:03,952
那你怎么不让人来修?
So why don't you get it fixed?

267
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:08,724
我打电话了 他们说 "交电费!"
I called, and they're like, "Pay your bill!"

268
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,860
如果你需要地方睡觉 我随时欢迎你
If you ever need somewhere to crash, there's always my place.

269
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:14,029
不了 我不想打扰你
Oh, no. I don't want to be an inconvenience.

270
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:16,965
你有你的女朋友们 而且...
You've got all your lady friends, and...

271
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,934
其实 我现在单身
Actually, I'm single now.

272
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:20,102
什么?!
What?!

273
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:21,370
什么时候的事情?
When did that happen?

274
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,272
我没事 只是选择了分手
It's okay. It's by choice.

275
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:26,542
好吧 是她们的选择 我很难过
Well, their choice, and it's not okay.

276
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:29,144
对不起 我不知道
Oh. Sorry. I didn't know.

277
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:32,881
没人知道 我觉得很丢脸 所以我谁都没说
Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn't say anything.

278
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,783
他怎么没告诉我们啊?
Why wouldn't he tell us?

279
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,785
难道我们是那种糟糕的朋友吗?
Are we bad friends?

280
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:39,187
他正在我们的热水浴缸里喝着我们的酒呢
He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.

281
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:41,857
好吧 活该他孤独一生
Yeah, he deserves to be alone.

282
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:46,094
所以你现在是重回情场了?
So you're back out on the dating scene now?

283
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:48,063
是吧 算是
Yeah, yeah, a little.

284
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:49,932
那肯定很意思啊 进展怎么样?
Oh, that must be fun. How's that going?

285
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:52,601
我现在正在跟你泡热水浴呢 所以不咋地啊
I'm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.

286
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:58,307
我是不是就该妥协那蠢卫生间时间表啊
Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.

287
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:59,942
不 别那么干
No, don't do that.

288
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:01,910
- 但你不就妥协了嘛!  - 正是啊!
- But you did!  - Exactly!

289
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:04,546
你得从我这吸取教训啊!
Learn from my mistakes!

290
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:07,516
一到早上7点18分 不管人在哪里
No matter where I am at 7:18 a.m.,

291
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:10,152
我的附近都得有个厕所
there better be a toilet nearby.

292
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:15,557
可是直接把他想要的给他 这么做简单多了啊
It's just so much easier to give him what he wants.

293
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,194
说是这么说 但是你就想想你已经取得的成就
Oh, true, but think of how much you've accomplished.

294
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:21,763
谁让他停止给口袋里的零钱消毒了?
Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?

295
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:23,765
我
Me.

296
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,867
谁成功让他把手套以外的东西
And who got him to put things other than gloves

297
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:27,603
放在汽车手套柜的?
in the glove compartment?

298
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,538
我
Me.

299
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,206
那是连指手套啦
It was mittens.

300
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:34,643
又是谁让他试了火鸡热狗的?
And who got him to try a turkey dog?

301
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:35,844
那实际上是Koothrappali
That was actually Koothrappali,

302
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:38,480
但是我让他把那口吐在我手上啦
but I did let him spit it out in my hand.

303
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:41,717
你怎么能现在停下呢?
Look, how can you stop now?

304
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,251
那简直就跟电影放到匹诺曹就要变成
That's like walking out of Pinocchio

305
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:45,821
真正的小男孩的时候走开不看一样
right before he becomes a real boy.

306
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,322
你说的对
You know, you're right.

307
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:48,924
我也是这段恋爱关系中的一员啊
I'm in this relationship, too.

308
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:49,925
我得为自己抗议
I need to stand up for myself.

309
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:50,932
当然啦
Of course you do.

310
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:53,762
如果他不喜欢的话 他就得搬回这里
And if he doesn't like it, he can move back here.

311
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:57,766
他倒是可以试试 不过他就得请个好锁匠了
Oh. He can try. He'd just need a good locksmith.

312
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:03,338
那你想撩谁呢?
Well, who you gonna hit on?

313
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,307
坐在我们前面的妹子也买了草莓味
The girl in front of us got strawberry.

314
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,342
你的最爱
That's your favorite.

315
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:11,146
不 如果这样的话 我下半辈子就得在打开冰箱
No. No, if we both like it, I'll spend the rest of my life

316
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:14,883
然后感慨 "哎呀 草莓味没有了" 中度过了
opening the freezer and going, "Aw, no strawberry."

317
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:17,686
那柜台后面那个妹子怎么样?
What about the girl behind the counter?

318
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:20,088
呃 她整天都在挖冰激凌啊
Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping.

319
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,959
可能一只手臂比另一只粗壮呢
One arm's probably bigger than the other.

320
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:27,396
是不是也有可能你其实根本不想认识别人呢?
Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?

321
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,533
你真是有大智慧啊
You are truly wise.

322
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:32,314
谢谢啊
Thank you.

323
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,636
我本来要说
I'd say

324
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:34,659
超出年龄的睿智 但是你年纪也不小了
wise beyond your years, but you're getting up there.

325
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:35,909
好吧
All right.

326
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:40,542
拜托 你到底是怎么了?
Come on. What is really going on with you?

327
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:45,213
Penny 我要跟你说个故事
Penny, I am going to tell you a story

328
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:46,481
这个故事我从来没跟任何人说过
that I've never told anyone.

329
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,050
好吧
All right.

330
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:50,385
我当年13岁
I was 13 years old,

331
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:53,388
正好大学放春假
and on spring break from college.

332
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:59,327
跟不上 继续
Not relating. Go on.

333
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:03,732
他们教不了我数学了 所以我就提前回家了
I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.

334
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,767
哦 现在我懂了 然后呢
Oh, now I'm with ya. Okay.

335
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,669
我妈在一个圣经学习班
My mother was at bible study.

336
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:10,305
我走进家里以为家里没人
I walked in the house expecting to find it empty,

337
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:14,142
然后我听到我父母的卧室里传来了什么声音
and I heard a sound coming from my parents' bedroom.

338
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:15,977
我打开门的时候
When I opened the door,

339
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:19,548
看见了我父亲正在和另一个女人发生关系
I saw my father having relations with another woman.

340
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,651
- 这太糟糕了!  - 就是啊
- Oh, that's awful!  - I know.

341
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:24,619
这也是为什么我每次进门前
It's also why I never open a door

342
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,288
都要敲三次门
without knocking three times.

343
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,223
我是想 第一次是传统意义上的敲门
I mean, the first one's traditional,

344
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:31,560
然后第二次第三次是为了让人把裤子提上
but two and three are for people to get their pants on.

345
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:34,896
那后来你爸那事怎么了呢?
Well, what happened with your dad?

346
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:37,999
我们对视了一下 我跑回了自己的房间
We locked eyes, I ran to my room,

347
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,702
然后我们再也没说起过这事
and we never, ever spoke of it.

348
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,604
你这个可怜的小倒霉
You poor thing.

349
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:45,107
自从Amy和我住在一起以后
Since Amy and I have been living together,

350
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:47,642
我们一直在跟我父母以前一样吵架
we've been bickering like my parents used to.

351
00:15:47,644 --> 00:15:51,012
你是怕你会做跟你爸类似的事吗?
And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?

352
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:53,648
是的 我得让她现在做好准备
Yes. I need to prepare her now

353
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,576
让她免除以后的痛苦
to save her from pain down the road.

354
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,819
以后的痛苦?
Down the road?

355
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,588
Sheldon 她只是想跟你分享一个牙刷架
Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you,

356
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,258
而你现在却在冰激凌店里试图撩妹子!
and now you're at an ice cream parlor trying to pick up women!

357
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:07,996
哎呀 什么事用你这种语气说出来都会变蠢的
Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.

358
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,031
亲爱的 与其担心未来
Honey, instead of worrying about pain

359
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:12,134
你有可能引起的痛苦 为什么不试着
you might cause in the future, how about trying

360
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,302
解除你现在带给她的痛苦呢?
to fix the pain you're causing her right now?

361
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:18,673
我想你是对的
I'm sure you're right.

362
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:21,610
我觉得我也应该跟你道歉
I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.

363
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,245
好吧
Okay.

364
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:26,214
看我勾搭其他女人 却根本没考虑到你
That must have hurt watching me look for other women

365
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:29,117
一定让你很受伤
without ever even considering you.

366
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:36,324
请一定要理解 你在我眼里
Please understand that I think of you

367
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:39,628
更像个保姆
as more of a nanny.

368
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,832
把冰激凌吃完吧 好让我把你带回家睡觉
Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.

369
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:51,039
我在想这是不是就是做
I wonder if this is what it feels like

370
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,542
Bernadette宝宝的感觉
to be Bernadette's baby.

371
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,213
我不觉得 Bernadette的宝宝可没有按摩喷气孔
I don't know. Bernadette's baby doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet

372
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:00,482
拍打着我的关键部位
hitting just the right spot.

373
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:06,655
那些喷气孔是为我的关键部位服务的 不是他!
Those jets are for my secret spot, not his!

374
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,957
你在那里面都干些什么啊?!
What do you do in there?!

375
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,994
反正是放松就对了 你不用知道更多了
It's called relaxing, and that's all you need to know.

376
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:17,699
现在已经很晚了
Well, it's getting late.

377
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,968
我们是不是该回家了
Maybe we should head home.

378
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,704
你说得对
Yeah, you're probably right.

379
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:25,907
走吗?
You coming?

380
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:27,709
嗯 等我一下
Yeah, just give me a minute.

381
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:28,944
为什么?
Why?

382
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:32,581
你看你是穿着泳裤的对吧?
Well, you know how you're wearing a bathing suit?

383
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,516
是啊?
Yeah?

384
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,586
我好像没和你一样走寻常路
I kind of went the other way.

385
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:41,323
你们这俩混蛋给我把这个热水浴缸买走!
You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!

386
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,705
你觉得怎样?
What do you think?

387
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,940
这位子还可以啊
It's a nice enough spot.

388
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,175
如果我要开始为自己抗议的话
You know, if I'm going to start standing up for myself,

389
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:00,103
这正是我要做的...
this is exactly the kind of thing...

390
00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:00,875
我们回来啦!
We're back!

391
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:02,521
嗨! 嗨!
Oh, hi! Hi!

392
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,188
哈喽
Hello.

393
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:07,355
你们怎么样啊?
How you guys doing?

394
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:08,523
我们挺好的 我觉得
We're doing good. I think

395
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:10,325
Sheldon有些话想要对Amy说
Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.

396
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:19,200
我想为我今天的行为道歉 那...
I wanted to apologize for my behavior today. It...

397
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:29,544
那都是不必要的
It was unnecessary.

398
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:32,847
这位子很暖和啊
This is warm.

399
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:39,721
还有 我愿意放弃卫生间时间表
Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.

400
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,990
真的吗?
Oh. Really?

401
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:44,192
凭什么她能捞到这么好的事?! 我们从来没有!
Why does she get that?! We never got that!

402
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:45,893
你想让他回来吗?
Do you want him back?

403
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:47,996
我很为你们感到高兴
I'm very happy for you.

404
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:51,499
Amy 你应该知道
Amy, you should know

405
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:53,868
我从来就没想要约其他女性
I was never really interested in seeing other women.

406
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,572
而为了证明我对我们的关系有多么认真
And to prove how serious I am about us,

407
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:01,309
我愿意将我们的关系带入到下一个层面
I'm willing to take our relationship to the next level.

408
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:04,812
Amy Farrah Fowler小姐
Amy Farrah Fowler,

409
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:07,949
你愿意跟我共享这个牙刷架吗?
will you share this toothbrush holder with me?

410
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:12,854
我愿意
I would love to.

411
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,027
我们真的
Did we really

412
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:21,729
需要在这里见证这个吗?
need to be here for this?

413
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:24,899
你觉得我疯了也没关系 但是我觉得这很感人
Call me crazy, but I found it moving.
