1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,602
Sheldon, it's not a great time!

2
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:04,070
What do you want?

3
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:07,306
Hello to you, too.

4
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:10,076
I'm sorry,
but this is important.

5
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:11,711
What is it?

6
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:13,279
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

7
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:16,182
in the <i>Back to the Future III</i>
case...

8
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,651
and <i>Back to the Future III</i>
was-- get this--

9
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:21,821
in the <i>Back to the Future II</i>
case.

10
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:23,798
So?

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,936
So, did you do that, or am I
in the house with an intruder?

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,023
Sheldon, I got to go inside.

13
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:34,859
It's getting rough out here.

14
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:38,946
You're dodging the question;
I knew it was you.

15
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:42,533
(deep rumbling growl)

16
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:43,885
What was that?

17
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:45,403
What was what?

18
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:46,821
This isn't
a very good connection,

19
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:49,957
but it sounded like someone
just released a kraken.

20
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:54,962
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

21
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,664
You know there's
no such thing as a...

22
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,417
(rumbling growl)

23
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:02,220
No...!

24
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:05,006
Penny... Penny...

25
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:06,757
(voice cracking):
Penny...!

26
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,176
What's the matter?

27
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:12,212
Um... well, I was worried

28
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:14,715
that you might be
missing Leonard.

29
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:18,486
And that might be causing
you to have bad dreams,

30
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:21,739
like the kind you'd get if you
watched <i>Clash of the Titans</i>

31
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:23,991
right before you went to bed.

32
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:27,662
Sweetie, did <i>you</i> have
a bad dream?

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,114
To be honest, I did.

34
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:31,065
Aw.

35
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,199
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

36
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:35,419
in the <i>Back to the</i>
<i>Future III</i> case.

37
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:37,538
Leonard did it.

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,506
Good night.

39
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:39,991
(stammering): No, wait.

40
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:42,793
Perhaps I should sleep here

41
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:45,613
so you don't miss
Leonard as much,

42
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:48,849
uh, 'cause you're being
kind of a baby about it.

43
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:55,806
You know what?
That would make me feel better.

44
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:57,692
Thank you.
You're welcome.

45
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,814

00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:34,544

56
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:36,287
I think you'd be
pleased to hear

57
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,005
that this morning in
the parking garage,

58
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,823
I saw this oil
stain on the ground

59
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:43,027
that was shaped just like
my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,

60
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,112
and I didn't get upset at all.

61
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,764
I'm proud of you.

62
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,551
Well, you should be,
'cause she was looking good.

63
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:53,888
Dear Lord!
You're an astronomer.

64
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,773
Although you may
have earthly woes,

65
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,092
get your mind back
on the stars.

66
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,343
Gee, even the lowly
dung beetle

67
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,713
chooses to plot its course
by using the Milky Way.

68
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:03,881
Is that true?

69
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,684
Everything I say is true.

70
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,652
Now, of course,

71
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,020
the dung beetle also enjoys

72
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,038
eating feces, living in feces

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,357
and making little
balls out of feces.

74
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,078
So pick and choose which
aspects of its lifestyle

75
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,046
you want to embrace.

76
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,549
Come on,
you can talk to girls now.

77
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,701
It shouldn't be hard for you
to meet someone new.

78
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,885
How can I meet someone new

79
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:27,605
when everywhere I look,
I see Lucy's face?

80
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,340
Tell me you don't see her smile

81
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,710
in the crust
of this chicken pot pie.

82
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,562
Oh, will you stop it!

83
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:40,134
Now, listen to me.

84
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,268
There's a welcome party

85
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,470
for incoming post-docs tonight.

86
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,071
Go to it and meet someone

87
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:47,324
who isn't made of grease or pie.

88
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:50,661
You think you're so cool
because your wife is a person?

89
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,832
(sighs)
Look,

90
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,734
Bernie's at a neuroscience
conference with Amy--

91
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,119
I'll go with you.

92
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,270
You would do that for me?
Of course.

93
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,504
You're my friend.

94
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,872
I want you to be happy.

95
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,758
Thanks. Oh, Sheldon,

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,292
since Amy's out of town,
would you like to join us?

97
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:07,995
I want you to be happy, too,

98
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,298
but not enough
to do anything about it.

99
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,753
Howie, stop.

100
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,854
I can't talk like that.

101
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,557
Amy's right here.

102
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,726
Sheldon, stop.
For the last time,

103
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,945
I will not bring home bed bugs.

104
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:26,096
The hotel's nice.

105
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,815
There's a pool, a gym--

106
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:29,433
the bar looks like fun.

107
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,320
Because I looked in the bed,
and there are no bugs.

108
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:34,622
Aw, I love you, too.

109
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,940
If I don't talk to you
before you go to sleep,

110
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,909
I'll meet you in dreamland.

111
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,161
AMY:
Good night.

112
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:43,464
No, I will not consider sleeping
in my garment bag.

113
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:50,588
Penny, did you ever wonder
how Starfleet captains...

114
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,773
No.

115
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,811
Well, now that I've piqued
your interest,

116
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,764
welcome to the exciting world
of 3D chess.

117
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,682
Why don't you just admit

118
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:02,900
you only want to play this game

119
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,318
because you always
play it with Leonard

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,436
and you miss him?

121
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,989
You overestimate
his significance in my life.

122
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,241
Oh...

123
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,359
Do I miss
how he makes a face

124
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,645
on my toaster waffle
with syrup?

125
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,230
No.

126
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,532
Do I miss the way

127
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:21,452
he fixes the zipper on my jacket
when it gets stuck?

128
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,537
(chuckles)
I don't think so.

129
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,589
Do I miss how
we say "good night"

130
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,042
to each other through the walls
of our bedroom

131
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:29,410
using Morse code?

132
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,595
(knocking in Morse code)

133
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,683
Okay, I get it, I get it.

134
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,551
You are an emotionless robot.

135
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,954
Well, I try.

136
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,590
All right, let's just get
this stupid game over with.

137
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,824
Great. I'll go first.
Okay.

138
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:45,976
By the way,
how are you with zippers?

139
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:46,665
Why?

140
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,280
Well, I really need
to go to the bathroom,

141
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,031
and this one's gone
all cattywampus.

142
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:56,704
Wow, your work on
jellyfish neural nets

143
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,055
sounds so interesting.

144
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,240
It is.

145
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:02,042
You can download my paper
off the university server.

146
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:04,211
I will. You can
download my paper

147
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,081
on the Van Allen Belts from the
university server as well.

148
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,833
I will.

149
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,002
All right.

150
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:21,228
(clicks tongue)

151
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,735
How'd it go?

152
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,887
Well, if you like dry,
factual statements

153
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,989
interspersed with painful
moments of silence,

154
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,908
it was bananas.

155
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,177
Check it out.

156
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,245
Mrs. Davis from Human
Resources is here.

157
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,898
She's probably on the lookout
for sexual harassment.

158
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,149
Oh, great.

159
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,068
There go my chances
of being sexually harassed.

160
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,840
I heard her husband left her
for a hot, young undergrad.

161
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,626
That's so much better
than the old, ugly ones.

162
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:58,799
Mr. Wolowitz,

163
00:06:58,801 --> 00:06:59,850
Dr. Koothrappali.

164
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,268
Mrs. Davis,
nice to see you.

165
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,922
You know, I recently read
a fascinating article

166
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,625
on infidelity among penguins.

167
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,227
Okay.

168
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,863
So if the fact
that your husband left you

169
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,765
makes you feel unattractive,
just remember,

170
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,801
penguins get cheated on,
and they're adorable.

171
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:27,945
(clicks tongue)

172
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,384
It was better when you
couldn't talk to women.

173
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:37,721
I was thinking of going
to the lecture

174
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,623
on posterior cingulate
cortex lesions

175
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,892
in the formation
of autobiographical memory.

176
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,844
Oh, brain lesions
are fascinating.

177
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:46,931
Unless they're yours,
then they're a drag.

178
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,466
To the advancement of science.

179
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,569
And to the sick and dying
who make it possible.

180
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,824
This is fun; we never
really get to talk shop

181
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:57,858
with Penny around.

182
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,610
We usually just end up
talking about boys.

183
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,912
Which is fine,
but it's nice to mix it up

184
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,814
with a little intellectual
conversation.

185
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,433
From the two gentlemen
at the bar.

186
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,035
Oh, my gosh, boys
bought us drinks!

187
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,704
Boys bought us drinks!
(gibbering happily)

188
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:12,573
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

189
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,676
Be cool.
You be cool!

190
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,762
Guys are hitting on us, and
not just to get to Penny.

191
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,515
You're right.

192
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:22,967
Thank you.

193
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:29,757
Ooh! Bad move.

194
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,925
Really? Why?

195
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:35,145
My queen can now take your rook
from below.

196
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,231
So that means I lose, right?

197
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,866
It's over!

198
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:42,269
If I make this move...

199
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,789
but I won't because we're having
too much fun.

200
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,460
Okay, let's take a break.

201
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,379
We're all out of alcohol.

202
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,014
I wasn't going to get alcohol.

203
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:56,550
(groans)

204
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,504
(sighs)

205
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,256
Gosh, I wonder what
Leonard's doing right now.

206
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:04,558
I miss him so much.

207
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,209
Well, if you'd like,

208
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,594
we could call him.

209
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,797
I-I mean that
you could call him.

210
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,098
As I've explained,

211
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,233
the absence of my friends
does not cause me pain.

212
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:15,486
As rock and roll bad boy,
Paul Simon, once said,

213
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,570
"I am a rock.

214
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,822
I am an i-i-i-island."

215
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:21,792
I'm calling him.

216
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,660
Oh, goodie!
Put him on speakerphone!

217
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,582
(dance music playing)

218
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,086
(phone vibrating)

219
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,420
Excuse me, ladies,

220
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,039
but my pants are buzzing.

221
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,673
(vibrating continues)

222
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,910
North Sea, how can I "kelp" you?

223
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:42,963
Leonard?

224
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:44,098
Penny?

225
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,215
Hey, it's Penny.

226
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,416
Everybody say hi to Penny.

227
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:48,102
ALL:
Hi, Penny!

228
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:51,822
Wow, it sounds like
you're having a good time.

229
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,708
Best time of my life!

230
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:59,463
Isn't it 5:30
in the morning there?

231
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,597
Is it?

232
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,317
Hey, everybody,
it's 5:30 in the morning!

233
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,352
(whooping)

234
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,870
Uh...

235
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,756
okay, well,
we were just calling you

236
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:10,273
because we were missing you.

237
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,492
Iceberg!

238
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:12,576
Uh-oh, hang on.

239
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,211
Are you in danger?

240
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,746
No, it's a drinking game.

241
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,781
Whenever we see an iceberg,
we take a shot!

242
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,833
ALL:
Berg! Berg!

243
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,252
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg--
(phone cuts off)

244
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:24,254
Leonard, Leonard?

245
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,473
(scoffs)

246
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:30,094
I cannot believe we were
missing that jerk.

247
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,913
<i>You</i> were.

248
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,487
So what happened?
How'd it go?

249
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:45,889
It's fine. I thanked them again
and let them know

250
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:46,823
we're not available.

251
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,975
So I can drink this
without having

252
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,911
to give up the goodies?

253
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:52,028
Yes, it's all cool.

254
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,931
Although, if you wanted
to talk to one of them,

255
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:56,249
no one would blame you.

256
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:59,035
And why would no one
blame me?

257
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:03,323
I don't know
what I'm saying.

258
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:05,842
Well, it sounds
like you're saying

259
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:07,594
that I could do better
than Sheldon.

260
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:09,963
Boy, these drinks are strong!

261
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:15,619
Hoo, mama, I'm gonna be gginhu !

262
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:18,805
No, tell me,
I want to know

263
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:20,390
what you meant by that.

264
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,895
I just meant
that you're not married

265
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:26,813
and your boyfriend's kind of...

266
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:28,782
Sheldon.

267
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:31,818
And your husband
is extremely Howard.

268
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,287
What's your point?

269
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,207
Sorry.
I have no point.

270
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:38,691
That was a stupid thing
to say.

271
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:41,077
Can we please just go back
to having a nice time?

272
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,381
We could, but unfortunately
my brain is lesion-free

273
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:46,249
and I remember that
rotten thing

274
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:48,502
you just said about
my sweet baboo.

275
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:49,669
Come on. I apologize.

276
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:51,638
Can we please
just let it go?

277
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,841
Sure.
Thanks.

278
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:59,546
Your husband's weird
and his clothes are ridiculous.

279
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:03,033
I can't believe it!

280
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,467
All this time
I've been doing nothing

281
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,036
but sit around
and miss that guy.

282
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:07,687
And you know what
the worst part is?

283
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:09,222
That you're having to process

284
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:11,324
your emotional pain
without vodka?

285
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,248
No.

286
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,333
Yes.

287
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:24,237
But you know what
the second-worst part is?

288
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,789
He does not miss me at all.

289
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,692
Allow me to comfort you.

290
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:31,862
At least you've got your health.

291
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:36,483
Really? Tha-That's it?
That's comforting?

292
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:40,554
Um, uh, in a hundred years,

293
00:12:40,556 --> 00:12:43,540
you'll both be dead
and it won't matter?

294
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,692
No! Come on!

295
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:48,478
You're supposed to say,
"Of course he misses you.

296
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,431
The only reason he's partying is
to cover up his pain."

297
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:54,084
Oh, no, I don't think
that's true at all.

298
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:57,988
This is ridiculous.

299
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,490
Why am I upset just because
he's off having a good time?

300
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:04,711
Well... perhaps you're
obsessively picturing him

301
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:09,049
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

302
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:15,071
Is that it?
Did I get it right?

303
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:17,674
Okay, tha-that's great.

304
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,960
You can stop trying to make me
feel better now.

305
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:22,729
Actually, I can't.
Before Leonard left,

306
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:25,215
he made me promise
that I'd take care of you.

307
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:27,601
He did?
Yes.

308
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:30,387
Oh, that's really sweet.

309
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,072
Plus, if I do a good job,

310
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:34,925
he said he'd bring me back
a sailor's cap.

311
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:38,745
Now I miss him even more.

312
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:43,333
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure Leonard's tormented

313
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:48,788
every moment he's away from your
warm embrace and cherry lips.

314
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:51,224
Thanks.

315
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:53,093
Oh, seriously?

316
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:58,131
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?

317
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,432
What?

318
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:02,469
I'd like to apologize
for being insensitive.

319
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:06,189
And for possibly making penguins
seem like jerks,

320
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:09,693
'cause 99% of them
are stand-up guys.

321
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:11,728
Forget about it.

322
00:14:13,114 --> 00:14:16,249
You know, you-you and I,
you and I have a lot in common.

323
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:17,667
Is that right?

324
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,369
Oh, yes, I-I, too,

325
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:21,988
am in the throes of heartbreak.

326
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,790
Okay, fine,
I'll tell you about it.

327
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,880
Here is a hot beverage
to comfort you.

328
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,782
It's in a to-go cup.

329
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:34,634
Make of that
what you will.

330
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,255
Come on. It's still early.

331
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:40,640
Let's do something.

332
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:46,229
Well, I have been toying around
with an idea for 4-D chess.

333
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:47,947
How about we just talk?

334
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:48,999
All right.

335
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,267
In 4-D chess...
No.

336
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:54,971
Come on, let's talk
about our lives.

337
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:56,856
Tell me something
about you I don't know.

338
00:14:56,858 --> 00:14:58,274
Hmm.

339
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:03,730
I own nine pairs of pants.

340
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:07,567
Okay, that-that's a good start,

341
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:08,918
but I was thinking
maybe something

342
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,969
a little more personal.

343
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:12,338
I see.
Hmm.

344
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,743
I own nine pairs
of underpants.

345
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,814
How about I go first?

346
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:23,967
But I don't want to know
how many underpants you own.

347
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:26,052
Although, based on the floor
of your bedroom,

348
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,804
I'd say it's a thousand.

349
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:32,308
Okay, look, here's something
people do not know about me.

350
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,144
When I first moved out
to L.A.,

351
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:36,596
I did a topless scene
in a low-budget horror movie

352
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:38,198
about a killer gorilla.

353
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,767
Ugh! After I did it,
I felt so ashamed.

354
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:43,937
Thankfully, that thing
never came out.

355
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,105
I've seen that.

356
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:49,159
Yeah. <i>Serial Apeist.</i>

357
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,360
(gasps)

358
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:54,714
Howard found it online
the day we met you.

359
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,216
Oh, God...

360
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:57,283
And it was literally

361
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,018
the moment you walked
out the door.

362
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,954
(sighs)

363
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:05,558
But I see the type of personal
revelations you're going for.

364
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,262
Okay, here's one I thought
I'd take to the grave.

365
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:10,547
Okay.

366
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:12,849
Hmm.

367
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,234
A while back,

368
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:17,437
YouTube changed
its user interface

369
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:22,125
from a star-based rating system
to a thumbs-up rating system.

370
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:27,147
I tell people I'm okay with it,
but I'm really not.

371
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:33,670
That's your big revelation?

372
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:36,406
Yes.

373
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:38,992
Whew! I feel ten pounds lighter.

374
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,710
Okay, you know what?

375
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:41,728
I give up.

376
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,746
I'm going to bed.

377
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:46,966
Here's something else
you don't know about me:

378
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:49,119
you just hurt my feelings.

379
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:50,320
What did I do?

380
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:51,888
I opened up and shared something

381
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,606
deeply upsetting to me,

382
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:55,775
and you treated it
as if it were nothing.

383
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,645
I-I didn't think
it was a big deal.

384
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:01,481
It is to me; that's the point.

385
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:06,019
Sheldon, you are right.

386
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:07,103
I'm really sorry.

387
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:08,771
I should've known better.

388
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,607
Your apology is accepted.

389
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,692
Thank you.

390
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:13,993
How about a hug?

391
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:15,478
How about a hearty handshake?

392
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,380
Come on.

393
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,352
Now I know how you felt
getting mauled

394
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:25,588
by that sex-crazed
gorilla.

395
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:42,105
Good night.

396
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:43,890
(curt):
Mm-hmm.

397
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,349
It was rather flattering to have
strangers send us drinks.

398
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:55,852
Yeah, that felt nice.

399
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:00,456
Maybe tomorrow morning
we put on some hot pants

400
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,660
and see if we can score us
some free omelets.

401
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:09,716
So, hypothetically, if-if we
were to have gone with them,

402
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,668
which one would you have picked?

403
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,288
I think I would

404
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,024
have gone with the short one
with the goofy haircut.

405
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:20,092
Oh, good, 'cause I liked
the tall thin one.

406
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:22,278
He seemed intelligent,
kind of a loner,

407
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,764
maybe a little sexually
inexperienced,

408
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:27,650
like I'd have to teach
him a thing or two.

409
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,519
(growls)

410
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:31,371
Not my guy.

411
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:33,323
I caught him staring
at my rack.

412
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:36,275
It'd be nice to be with a man

413
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:39,045
who wants to know
what's underneath my cardigan.

414
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:42,048
FYI, it's another cardigan.

415
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:47,520
Your short sexed-up guy
kind of sounds like Howard.

416
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:50,790
Your brainy virgin kind
of sounds like Sheldon.

417
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:53,393
Good night.
Night.

418
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:59,065
All right, Dr. Koothrappali,
it's been nice talking to you,

419
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,433
but I need to go home

420
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,567
and relieve my babysitter.

421
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,820
Yeah, I can relate
to being a single parent.

422
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:05,772
I have a dog.

423
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:08,608
Yeah, it's exactly
the same thing.

424
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,909
Good night.

425
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:11,577
Mrs. Davis...

426
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:14,414
I, uh, I must confess,

427
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,832
I came here tonight

428
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,568
in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely postdoc,

429
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,805
but instead I got to connect
with you at a human level.

430
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,575
That's a much better evening.

431
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,378
You're a lovely person.

432
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,129
Are you hitting on me?

433
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:31,881
No, no, no, that would be crazy!

434
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:33,353
I mean, if I were hitting
on you, you'd know it

435
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:36,155
'cause you'd feel uncomfortable
and a little sad for me.

436
00:19:40,424 --> 00:19:42,308
You're sweet.

437
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,261
Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.

438
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:47,363
Good night.

439
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,084
Looks like she accepted
your apology.

440
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:52,785
And then some.

441
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,871
I think we had a moment.

442
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:57,540
Oh, please, you did not
have a moment.

443
00:19:57,542 --> 00:19:59,742
Who died and
made you king of moments?

444
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,664
Okay, fine. Let's say
there was a moment.

445
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,532
There was.
There wasn't.

446
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:10,636
But... But even if there was,
what are you gonna do about it?

447
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:16,559
I will slowly seduce her until
she falls helpless into my bed,

448
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:18,561
hungry for the pleasure
only I can give her.

449
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:20,430
So nothing.
No, not a thing.

450
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,909
Ah...

451
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,412
I'm so glad the police
finally caught

452
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:37,049
that psychotic
genetically engineered ape.

453
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,523
That is my girlfriend!
I swear to God!

454
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:46,058
(all cheer)

455
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,594
ALL: Leonard! Leonard!
Leonard! Leonard!

456
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:51,430
(gasps, screams)

457
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:56,432
